<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, and Jimmy Trinny engaging in extremely vulgar and sexually suggestive conversation.  This was immediately followed by a protracted technical difficulty segment, featuring repeated complaints about loud headphone audio and troubleshooting attempts with sound engineer, Mars, punctuated by phrases like "me, me, me" and audio tests using the sentence "The boy with the toast ate the most."  The show then moved to a discussion of a rumor about the Pope defecating in the woods, Mike Francesa's stubborn refusal to admit fault in a snowstorm prediction, and Anthony's Twitter interaction with Richard Dreyfuss, stemming from Dreyfuss's appearance on an NRA unfriendly list.  Anthony detailed his attempts at explaining a joke to Dreyfuss without getting blocked.

The broadcast continued with a comparison of Artie Lange's new, technologically superior radio studio to their own comparatively meager setup. They briefly mentioned Modest Yahoo's performance and an Anthony Bourdain interview on Artie's show.  A substantial portion then focused on the Navy SEAL who killed Osama bin Laden, referencing a recent interview detailing the raid, the SEAL's lack of pension, and his account of the event.  The hosts expressed astonishment at the raid's success and discussed the SEAL's narrative,  expanding into highly critical commentary about the government's handling of the situation, specifically criticizing Obama’s administration and using highly offensive language. This segment also included racially charged jokes about a potential Black Pope and a lengthy discussion of child sexual abuse within the Catholic Church.

The show further delved into the topic of bootlegging concerts, sharing personal anecdotes, including a story about a "What's Happening?" episode featuring the Doobie Brothers and a tape recorder incident.  This segment involved numerous references to various musicians and bands, a critical review of The Doors' music, interspersed musical interludes,  Valentine's Day gift suggestions (including ads for Steven Singer Jewelers and Sherry's Berries), and a mention of the movie "Livewire."  The Doors were a recurring topic, including a discussion about the posthumous release of Jim Morrison's poetry set to music, and a critical analysis of Mike Francesa's weather forecasting.  Audio clips of Francesa's broadcasts were played and dissected.  The conversation also touched on U2's guitarist, The Edge, with a discussion of a documentary clip showcasing the simplicity of his guitar techniques, followed by a discussion of Anthony's brother's guitar playing.  A parody song about the Pope by Scott and Todd was discussed, along with a debate on the copyright status of traditional songs. A caller, Joe, a member of a U2 tribute band, contributed to the discussion, detailing The Edge’s techniques and announcing his Abu Dhabi gig.  He also discussed his involvement in a Journey tribute band, and a planned Pink Floyd/Wizard of Oz synced-up performance, punctuated by further tangents (including a discussion about blueberries). Craig Robinson was mentioned as an upcoming guest.  The segment also featured much banter between the hosts and sound engineer Sam.

The show then pivoted to a "Doors Break" concert review deemed "not great" by one of the hosts, a Black History Month mention of Frederick M. Jones, the inventor of the air conditioning unit (followed by a comedic bit involving a malfunctioning AC unit and crude racial slurs), and Valentine's Day gift advertisements (including Steven Singer Jewelers, with the intentionally insulting phone number 888-I-HATE-STEVEN-SINGER, Vermont Teddy Bear, and ProFlowers), featuring frequent interruptions, humorous banter, and insults.  A significant portion focused on Jim Norton's purported "Jim Norton Guide to Jersey City Prostitution" DVD, with explicit details about his experiences.  Craig Robinson then joined the show to promote "Escape from Planet Earth," leading to a conversation filled with tangents, including a National Enquirer story about O.J. Simpson, further humorous banter, and discussions of Robinson's career and voice acting experiences.

The broadcast concluded with more Valentine's Day advertisements, followed by Opie unexpectedly distributing checks and cash to staff members (Sal, Fez, Pip, and Mars), interns excluded due to inattention.  The show then transitioned to a discussion of the upcoming "Gay Off" contest featuring Go Go Harder and three couples, the details of Sal's recent full-body wax and subsequent conflict with Travis (involving pubic wax),  speculation about Troy's participation in the "Gay Off," and plans for spending the unexpected windfall from Opie's money.  A caller suggested a Black History Month segment on Sal, another submitted a "Goodbye to Gay" parody song.  The show also included calls to action encouraging listeners to vote for a caller's MLB.com contest entry and advertisements for Dollar Shave Club and Steven Singer Jewelers,  with Chaz as a phone guest.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Welcome to the R.B. and Earth show.  What before has one radio show been so extreme?  So vulgar.  Fuck you, I'm not a pussy!  I was accustomed to getting blown and having my ass eaten.  This is insane. I mean, this is insane.  So flagellant. 
[00:00:30]  Why do we even try?  Let's just fart in from the mics and call it a day.  This is the funniest shit ever.  It's a weird show.  That's what's real.  That's sex.  Tune in with no expectations.  Quite simply.  The greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  Here we are.  Yelp and Anthony's show.  Another four hours is long.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Yeah! 
[00:01:00]  Check.  Yelp.  Yelp.  Check it.  I'm up early in the morning.  Yawning.  Put Opie Anthony.  Yeah.  Jimmy Trinny pointing.  Opie like brother man.  Ant wants to join the clan.  Jimmy on the other hand.  He working the other hand.  Turnin' my headphones up.  There are horrible people to say in this old.  Objectional human beings and I want you to look unacceptable to my scene.  But I'll give it a go.  50 cent Larry King, Opie and Anthony's show. 
[00:01:30]  Go, go.  I know you feelin' the flow.  But Opie's motherfuckin' things tryin' to get blown.  And we come to play around and we still in the show.  I know you never heard nothin' like this before.  How important is the board?  Board you'll never be.  And don't worry about gettin' shot when you're with Anthony.  Oh yeah, on the edge of your hair.  Cause you really wanna hear Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy.  Just keep it right here.  It's the Opie and Anthony's show.  Yeah.  The Opie and Anthony's show.  Yeah.  Cause it's the Opie and Anthony's show. 
[00:02:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony's show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  50.  Yeah.  Now Mike Tyson up in this pit.  It's the Opie and Anthony's show.  Booga booga.  Booga booga.  Enough of this plava.  Let's get this show on the road.  Pallava.  Morning, everybody.  Oh my goodness gracious.  Here we go.  Tuesday, huh?  That's what they tell me. 
[00:02:30]  It is today.  Yes, it is.  Why is the music so loud?  I don't know.  We got lots to do today.  Lots and lots to do today.  Stretch.  Yeah.  That Pope shit is fucked up.  The Pope.  We got the...  Let's make a list of things we're gonna talk about today.  Ah.  Got the Pope shit.  That's pretty whack.  In the woods, apparently. 
[00:03:00]  From what I've heard growing up.  What?  Pope shit's in the woods.  Oh yeah, he does shit in the woods, right.  That's what I heard.  Right.  Rumor had it.  Rumor had it, right.  Ah, you got that.  You got Anthony going back and forth with Richard Dreyfuss last night.  Yes, that was a lot of fun, hopefully.  We also got Mike Francesa losing his shit again.  Mike Francesa.  As much as your exchange with Richard Dreyfuss was terrific, and we're certainly gonna talk  about that, and we're gonna talk about the Pope thing, I think my number one today is  Mike Francesa again. 
[00:03:30]  Mike Francesa.  Yeah, man.  Something is not right with the guy.  I guess before the snowstorm, he kind of went with the fact that it wasn't gonna be a big  deal.  Yeah.  And you did it.  And I'm not even sure if you were kidding or not, to be honest with you.  Well, a lot of people seem to think I'm totally serious.  I'm so distracted by the microphone change now.  What might change?  When yours has changed?  No, I turn up my volume now to where it usually is.  Right.  You're fucking blasting in my ears.  Really?  Yeah. 
[00:04:00]  So now I gotta turn myself down, which makes it weird to try to talk, because now I can't  hear myself in the headphones.  Mine sounds terrific today.  Yours is a lot...  You are much louder, yeah.  It's loud as fuck, and Chris...  I think I should be real loud on this show.  But it's coming through the headphones too loud.  Way too loud.  Testing.  This is fucking...  This is gonna fuck me up.  No testing.  And I never like...  I usually can skate with whatever the fuck happens.  This is a biggie, because I really need to hear myself pretty juicy through the headphones. 
[00:04:30]  So what happened?  Well, if I turn the headphones up, you are like killing my ears.  So what's that about, Mars?  Mars, what is that?  Yeah.  Oh boy, you're getting fired.  Vibrate.  Your input is stronger than his.  Nice.  I like that.  Oh, man.  My input is stronger than his.  I like that.  It sounds sexual.  I got a good input.  Nice.  Oh man, I knew shit would get fucked up.  How good is my input?  God damn it.  3.5.  3.5. 
[00:05:00]  Fuck you.  One thing gets fixed in this motherfucker.  3.5 is an input?  Something else gets fucked.  It never fails.  It's so like tedious.  It never fucking fails.  It's so like this.  It's a fucking delicate ecosystem.  Thank you.  Right.  It's like if you get rid of a fucking, like a certain little type of fish, the fucking  woolly mammoth dies.  Yeah, I know.  It's just retarded.  So what are we going to do, Mars?  Ah, Mars.  Because now here's the problem.  That just turned me up. 
[00:05:30]  That was good.  Wait, did it do anything to me?  No.  Oh, nice.  All right, so we might be onto something.  That was pretty good.  Because my mic.  Turn me up just a tad more.  Get mine to six.  You want a six, Jimmy?  Two 3.5s and I'll take a six.  See, these go to.  Wow, that's kind of weird now.  Yeah, well, now you're getting louder in my headphones, so now I'm going to have to raise  my voice.  Yeah, that's a little.  There you go.  There you go.  All right.  Can you imagine if we did this on regular radio?  Oh, my God.  Fucking PDs would be running down the hall going, you're on the air doing this. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, well, what do you want from us?  Well, all right.  How's that?  How's that?  Me, me, me, me.  Let's do our me, me, me, me.  Me, me, me, me.  Me, me, me, me.  Ha, ha, noises.  Me, me, me, me, me.  Ha, ha, noises.  Me, me, me, me.  All right, that'll do for now.  You sound a little distorted now.  Yeah, it's totally fucking.  You fucked up the whole thing, Mars.  Everything's fucked up.  And now I feel like I'm a little too loud now.  You sound distorted.  You both do.  I'm a little distorted.  Definitely. 
[00:06:30]  Is this what's going out, Mars?  Hold on, let me try this.  Are you adjusting what's going out or what's in our headphones?  I'm adjusting what's going into your mic right now.  Oh, let me try this.  Oh, how's this sound?  What?  How's this sound?  That sounded better.  Sounded a little better?  Well, I turned down this a little bit over here.  I'm almost doing a check one, two.  Check one, two.  Let me just, let me just, my test is this.  The boy with the toast ate the most.  How's that?  That's a good one.  Let me try a few things over here.  Keep talking it. 
[00:07:00]  I'm going to talk a little bit.  Oh, Jesus.  That's terrible.  Look at that.  I like that.  That's perfect.  I like it that way.  That's good.  That's good.  Keep it just like that.  You sure?  Oh, God.  Is that good?  I like that.  Holy shit.  What?  I like that.  You need a little more?  Noises.  All right, that's good.  You're good.  Oh, my God.  That's perfect.  All right.  That's perfect.  Jimmy, you're good.  That's really good right now.  I like the sound of this thing.  That's good.  That's good.  All right, hold on.  I got to get Jimmy.  Oh, my God.  I got to get Jimmy.  Hold on.  All right, Jimmy.  Go.  Wait, I can't hear myself at all. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, my God.  I can't hear you.  I got nothing out of it, Mars.  Oh, my God.  Now everything's all fucked up.  What?  It's terrible.  I just made a few adjustments.  We're good.  A few adjustments.  Jimmy's at a minus 26 gain.  Listen to Jimmy's mic.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  The boy with the chest.  And then I'm over here with this.  Right.  Hey, this is good.  All right, you want a little more or are you good?  No, I think I'm okay.  Oh, my God.  Let me put you down over here. 
[00:08:00]  Wow.  Jimmy, I'm going to give you a...  This is terrible.  Jimmy, I'm going to give you like a two, I think.  I'd like a two.  All right.  All right.  How's that?  Oh, that's good.  That's good, right?  Boy, with the toast, ate the most.  Ate the most.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Whatever.  So anyway, Mike Francesca, are you good?  No.  For now?  I guess for now we'll muddle through one day at a time.  One day at a time.  So one day at a time.  All right.  So Mike Francesca refuses to admit he was wrong. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Were you fucking around with the snowstorm?  Did you know that was going to be a motherfucker or did you mess that one up?  Well, apparently people...  Wow, I don't like that.  I don't like this either.  It's so fucking...  Everything's fucked from where it was.  What happened yesterday?  Who was in the studio from yesterday?  It's just fucked.  Well, this mic...  No, but who came into broadcast?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  This mic has been a problem for a while.  So Mars is trying to fix this mic.  And as he tried to fix this mic, he fucked up everything else.  Mars, he can't be this loud in my headphones. 
[00:09:00]  Opie cannot be this loud in my headphones.  Why?  Why, man?  What's that about?  Because I can't turn myself up.  What the fuck?  Did I like hear my voice or something?  Jesus Christ.  What the fuck's that about?  Because now, in order to have you not that loud, where it hurts my fucking ears...  Right.  I have to turn myself down where I can't hear myself in the headphones anymore.  Now I have no...  But when you turn that down, then it messes this mic up.  Oh, God. 
[00:09:30]  What the fuck?  What the fuck, man?  How's that?  We better go home.  We better go home and let Mars fix everything.  This is terrible.  Can we go home?  I don't know.  Let me see.  How's that?  All right.  Now you talk.  Me, me, me, me.  That sounds better.  All right.  Let's deal with that.  Just leave it there.  Fuck, what?  Yeah, ants are real loud.  I don't fucking know what the fuck anymore. 
[00:10:00]  Everyone sounds the same in my headphones.  So what are you guys hearing?  I hear you clipping and distorting.  Yeah, ants is.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm distorted.  Really?  Yes.  It doesn't sound like it did yesterday.  Fuck, man.  God, this really sucks.  I can't...  I can't function like this.  You want to sit next to Sam?  No.  You want to sit on my lap?  Right.  Sam's mic, by the way, is perfect right now.  As it should be.  It's perfect, Sam.  This jean shirt.  This is terrible.  Jean shirts are in.  It is.  That's a great shirt. 
[00:10:30]  Rattly.  Jean shirts are really in right now.  Are they really in 1988?  No, I'm serious.  It really is in.  It's all about the jean shirts.  I don't know why.  I've never seen anybody in a jean shirt.  I almost bought one myself the other day.  That's adorable if you're on a prison break.  Exactly.  Exactly.  He's dressed like fucking one of the Anglin brothers in Escape from Alcatraz.  Yes!  That's what they were wearing.  Hey, why don't you fucking go get litmus something?  Some fucking pasta for some mice.  Oh, God.  You don't listen to them, Sam. 
[00:11:00]  I know they're in.  I'm with the hipsters.  It's terrible.  Oh, it's on.  Just for now.  Just for now.  Because Mars is adjusting.  Yeah, Mars is adjusting.  Is that a rough jean shirt or no?  It's 11.  Oh, boy.  I don't know.  You sound all right.  Am I?  Oh, no, I sound shitty.  Oh, God.  I know.  What the fuck?  Wait.  Mars.  I hope he doesn't sound as good.  Can you put it back the way it was yesterday?  The boy with the toys enjoys the most.  Is it?  Is it possible to just put the fucking thing back the way it was?  That's a good mic test. 
[00:11:30]  Before we put your head under a stereo and start kicking the shit out of you?  Exactly.  Old school.  Yeah, you're beating.  Like mommy used to do?  Fuck, man.  I'm going to burn your hand with a spatula.  Sorry, Mars.  Sorry.  Exactly.  It's too close.  Yeah.  Nice.  Everything's back to the mic.  Everything's back the way it was.  Does it sound as good?  All right.  All right.  Does Jim's mic work?  Does my mic work work?  Yeah, yeah.  I hear you.  The boy with the toast and eats the most.  It's all right.  I hope his mic isn't dumb.  It's fine.  How's that sound to you? 
[00:12:00]  It's still a little loud.  I'm a little loud?  It's louder than usual.  How's that?  All right.  Nice, right?  Yeah, there we go.  Let's run with this.  How about this?  Is this good right here?  Let's run with this.  Oh, boy.  Oh, he's back down there again.  Jesus Christ.  Mars, leave everything alone.  Mars, Mars, Mars.  He's spilling it.  I just ate the mic for a bit, and he thinks it's real.  I went, how's this?  And then he jumps down there to adjust.  To adjust.  Mars. 
[00:12:30]  Stop fiddling with things.  Oh, my God, man.  You're fiddling.  You're fiddling.  Stop fiddling, Mars.  Mars loves fiddling.  Could be one of my favorite bits.  I love that one.  Remember that guy?  Papa Rock.  It's, I don't know.  I don't know if the bit does it justice.  To watch that guy fucking try to play his guitar for, honestly, 20 minutes.  It would give me an anxiety attack.  And the best he could do is maybe play a note for two seconds, and then he started fiddling  again.  You have to fiddle.  Oh, my God. 
[00:13:00]  You'd have to fiddle.  If you could find a short clip of that today, Iraq, I would love it.  Only if it works, though.  Only if it works.  All right.  Where were we?  Okay.  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  Mike Francesa.  I know a lot of people called me out on getting my forecast wrong.  I want to know if you were fucking around or not.  I'd be honest.  Of course.  Are you just saying that?  No, of course.  I wasn't serious.  No, I know you weren't serious when the storm was hitting, and you were still going with  the bit.  I'm just saying when we were trying to figure out that snowstorm.  And I was saying a rain event. 
[00:13:30]  It's going to be a rain event.  Were you serious?  No.  I knew it was going to snow.  You knew we were going to get hammered?  Yeah, it's hammered.  I didn't know it was going to be as bad as it was, but I knew it wasn't going to be a  rain event.  I can't get enough of those pictures, man.  People called me out, though.  Yeah.  Well, Mike Francesa basically said it wasn't going to be that much of a big deal.  Oh.  But I don't blame them, because these weather guys always make it sound like it's worse  than it's going to be.  But this time, they were right.  Every once in a while, they're right with their fear-mongering. 
[00:14:00]  But Mike Francesa said it wasn't going to be a big deal, and then people were calling  him yesterday to try to tell him that he was wrong, and he refuses to admit he was  wrong.  He's such a fucking douche.  It's so weird, and it's not even a bit, which makes it so great to listen to.  So we're getting the clips.  We're going to play that.  He knows a lot about this.  He's a smart guy, but he's just a bore and a fat guy.  He's fun to listen to if you want to just think he's a dick.  But he's like, you know, what are you talking about?  Who enjoys that guy?  He's a fucking shit.  They don't have any water.  He is a dick. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, he's a douche.  It's pretty obvious he's a dick.  The best is a bit going around with Mike Francesa where they put his big, huge, over-the-top  head on stuff.  And somebody...  And I forget.  I've got to start writing these down, because these people should get some credit.  Guy writes, hey, Ope, I've got an exclusive picture of Mike Francesa using his snowblower.  It's a snowblower dude, but it has Mike Francesa's big, smiling head on it.  Big head.  It's so simple, but so fucking funny to me, man. 
[00:15:00]  He does have a giant head.  Is this all the audio right here?  Maybe.  So maybe Travis doesn't have to cut it up.  How long is this?  Five and a half minutes.  Wow.  Could be it.  Oh, fuck it.  Let's play this.  If there was a Hall of Fame...  Wait, go, go, go.  Backwards.  Backwards.  You haven't missed anything really yet.  I don't care.  Yeah.  All right.  We're back.  Let's get a couple of calls in here.  Derek and Queen starts us off.  What's up, Derek?  Hey, Mike.  How you doing? 
[00:15:30]  I told you yesterday, but I hung up on myself by accident.  I had a Hall of Fame question.  What was it?  All right.  If you consider yourself a tough grader for the Hall of Fame, right?  Yeah, I would say.  Yeah, the baseball Hall of Fame, right?  I would say, yeah.  If there was a Hall of Fame for, like, stuttering and repeating yourself, would you put yourself in it?  We heard that.  I've never stuttered a day in my life.  Oh, you repeat yourself.  Yeah, we've done that one.  That's a different one.  Yeah, it's all right.  I think Travis is working on it down the hall. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, y'all.  He proceeds to answer that question by stuttering.  He's a stuttering, muttering prick.  So.  Yeah.  Wow, man, the mic thing really fucking threw off the show, right?  That threw me for a loop.  It threw off the show.  Got me angry.  I couldn't hear properly.  One thing as a broadcaster, ladies and gentlemen, you do need a good sound in your headphones.  And every radio guy is the same.  If that shit is, like, changed just slightly, it will just throw you off. 
[00:16:30]  A lot of times I can get through it.  But when the volume difference, like if it's a tone thing or it sounds more treble-y than bass one day, I could kind of deal with that.  But a volume issue where I've got to turn myself way down or there's pain in my ears, oh boy, I can't do that.  All right.  Well, what happened with Richard Dreyfuss as we wait for the Mike Francesco audio?  Oh, Richard Dreyfuss.  Well, Richard Dreyfuss was tweeting some NRA things, some gun things last night. 
[00:17:00]  And, you know, he's one of the Hollywood guys.  So, of course, he's not a big NRA guy.  It seems the NRA had a list of people and organizations and whatnot that are not friendly with the NRA.  And I guess that comes in handy if they're doing some kind of appearances or things like that.  It keeps the riffraff out from, you know, jumping up and yelling things out.  I don't know what their purpose is.  But one of the people's names was Richard Dreyfuss.  Richard Dreyfuss was saying that wasn't him. 
[00:17:30]  And then he went on to comment a little more about the NRA and what they're all about.  And, of course, it wasn't very flattering.  So I just tweeted, I bet you'd love that.  Get your name in the guns and ammo, which is a takeoff on his scene.  I bet you'd love that with the mayor.  Get your name in the National Geographic.  Yeah, yeah.  From Jaws, of course.  From Jaws.  And then Richard Dreyfuss, he responded to me with, what? 
[00:18:00]  So now I'm like, oh, no, shit.  All right, now you've started with Richard Dreyfuss.  But I felt, like, fucked up because I'm like, I want Richard Dreyfuss to get my joke.  Right.  Because if he doesn't get the joke, then it seems like I'm bashing him.  And he doesn't understand the bashing, so he might just block me.  And I'll be blocked by Richard Dreyfuss.  But you're in a tough spot because you're a gun guy.  He's not a gun guy in the end. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, but even that, like, I don't care about that part of it.  Like, he's not one of these.  You just want him to love you.  I want Richard Dreyfuss' love.  Because he's been in a lot of great movies.  Yes, he's Matt Hooper for the love of Christ.  He doesn't care that he was Matt Hooper, though, obviously.  Apparently not.  I saw some of these tweets.  But apparently he doesn't care about that.  So you want him to love you.  I want his love.  And he said, what?  So how did you respond?  He said, what?  Then I tried to respond quickly, too, because I didn't want him to just blow me up thinking, 
[00:19:00]  this guy's bashing me, obviously.  You know, it sounds like a bash.  You should have waited two hours and then respond.  No, because he blocked me.  I don't want to be blocked by Richard Dreyfuss.  I don't want to be Richard Dreyfuss blocked.  Let's see.  What?  And then I said, get your Jaws script out, sir.  Mayor giving you lip service at the defaced billboard.  And I went, big fan.  And then he tweeted back, this tweet is honestly indecipherable to me. 
[00:19:30]  Now I'm like, oh, fuck.  Oh, shit.  Now I'm like, I'm in a jam with Richard Dreyfuss now.  He doesn't get that.  Now he didn't get the explanation.  He's just going to block me for being some guy that isn't making any sense.  But is he losing it? 
[00:20:00]  Why doesn't he understand the explanation?  I understand maybe not understanding the first tweet, but now you're explaining it and  he still doesn't understand.  I know.  Okay.  And then I wrote, see, you, now I'm explaining Jaws to Richard Dreyfuss.  That's great.  It got very awkward for me.  That's great.  I said, see, you, Brody, and the mayor were by that Coppertone billboard.  And then I put, let's see, where's the next one? 
[00:20:30]  I said, you're by the Coppertone billboard.  No.  Where's the rest of that?  Go up a little more, maybe.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, God.  Where did it go?  See, he's basically proving that you need to get a life.  What?  Because you watch so much TV and so many movies that even the star of the movie doesn't give  a fuck as much as you do.  I know.  Uh, yeah, I see you, you, uh, Brody, um, uh, and the mayor were by the, the, the Coppertone 
[00:21:00]  billboard.  And, uh, and, and you said, it's a great white.  And, and then the mayor says, and I'm, I'm, I'm explaining this to him.  I said, and then the mayor says, uh, uh, bet you'd love that.  Get your name in the National Geographic.  Right.  I said, I was just making a joke about that.  Right.  You were just changing the magazine.  Uh, and then I went, uh, LOL, big fan. 
[00:21:30]  Start groveling.  Twitter groveling is the worst.  I was, I was Twitter groveling.  I wasn't even trying to hide it.  I was Twitter groveling.  And then Richard Driver says, uh, oh, you were quoting the mayor in your original, uh, tweet.  I'm sorry.  I was too deep in the gun weeds to get it all clear.  Apologies.  Uh, yeah.  Uh, so I put, no problem, Mr. Dreyfuss.  It was 38 years ago. 
[00:22:00]  Now go play with your mashed potatoes.  Hoping, hoping he would get the Close Encounters reference.  He never, uh, wrote back after that, did he?  No, no.  And then other people saying, God, I do hope he doesn't get that reference either.  And they're all, like, putting his name in this, too.  Were you worried that some dick fans were going to go, you know, he's just fucking with you  because he's, you know, like, you know the fans are going to hear.  They were.  Some guy wrote, uh, Mr. Dreyfuss, Anthony Cumia is a raging alcoholic.  Don't pay attention to him. 
[00:22:30]  Jesus.  I'm like, jeez.  You're ratting me out to Mr. Dreyfuss.  I thought it was me who wrote that film.  So, so that went back and forth, uh, for a little bit.  And then some of the fans started, like, getting on him.  Like, oh, what's the matter?  You don't remember your own movies?  And, uh, you don't remember your own movies?  Exactly.  Ooh, AIDS.  And, and he, so he, he started, like, answering them.  Right.  And I was, I, I put Mr. Dreyfuss, I apologize for, uh, the fans. 
[00:23:00]  I go, as you know, they're a pain in the ass, but a necessary evil.  And then I put a little, um, a little icon of a big sack of money.  Nice.  Very funny.  How'd you do that?  Oh, I have the little things.  You could put the little symbols.  You could put little things.  On Twitter.  I've seen those.  Yes.  It's an amazing world, Jimmy.  You could tell whole stories with them.  Wow.  Yes.  Exactly.  All right, we have, we have a goal today. 
[00:23:30]  We gotta have Richard Dreyfuss on the phone to talk about this further.  Clear this up.  How do we do this?  He was on our show once.  He was.  And he was supposed to come again.  Probably four years ago at this point.  But he was on.  Yeah.  For that Poseidon Adventure movie that didn't do well.  Five years now?  2005.  Dude, that was eight years ago.  No!  Yeah, because it was the old studio.  The old studio before the build-out.  Old studio.  Oh, God, that's right.  Before the build-out.  We had Richard Dreyfuss on eight years ago?  Yeah, it was before, it was before you had the big studio on 57th Street.  Oh, my God, we're closer to death.  Yeah.  A lot closer. 
[00:24:00]  A lot closer, right?  No, we're so young and firm, it always feels like yesterday.  How was that eight years ago?  Almost, yeah.  Time goes so quickly.  We were so excited.  We were like, holy fuck, we're talking to Richard Dreyfuss.  I can't believe that was so many years ago.  It can't be eight years.  Yeah.  Wow.  Because it was before the build-out.  Can we at least say seven and change?  It's crazy.  No.  Let's go seven and change.  Make it a little easier to handle today.  Well, let's try to get him on the show.  Well, yeah, that would be nice, but I can't see that happening.  Wow, we've been just rotting away for eight years.  Rotting away. 
[00:24:30]  Eight years just trying to get something going, and the mud's just getting thicker and thicker  around us.  Oh, it was...  Trying to get traction.  Oh, my God.  Fucking, it's knee-deep.  Wow.  That mud sound.  How was the Artie Show last night, speaking of mud?  Were you depressed?  Two hours with him.  It's fucking massive, the studio.  I mean, I've showed you pictures before.  There was a band came in.  Who's that guy?  That's not all he is, but he's a...  Paul McCartney?  No, he was going to come, but I bumped him.  He's Jewish. 
[00:25:00]  He's a Jewish rapper.  Oh, you don't know him?  Modest Yahoo?  Yeah, he was on the show.  Modest Yahoo's on the show?  He's big, right?  I love Modest Yahoo.  Yeah, even though he was very good.  He sang us.  He didn't rap, though.  He sang a really cool tune.  Yeah, he does a little of everything.  Holy fuck.  Did you meet him?  Yeah.  Did he care?  I took a picture with him, just because I know who he is.  But I remembered...  Give me some Modest Yahoo, E-Rock.  Oh, jeez.  The song, I forget what it was called.  You go with the big hit.  I don't give a fuck.  I'll be honest. 
[00:25:30]  I don't know his latest stuff.  He's a big dude.  He's a tall guy, man.  He's like, what is he, 6'6"?  He's a fucking big kid.  Modest Yahoo.  What's that?  He's big, right?  Yeah, he's really tall.  But, you know, literally, we're sitting in the...  When you walk into the studio, the far left corner is where there's a big desk.  And now all the seats are facing the same way, which is you're facing another desk with a bank of computers.  That's like us looking, say, with a 10-foot gap at a big desk with E-Rock, Sam, and Travis at it. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, there you go.  Hold on.  What's the ping pong table all about?  They just have room in the corner.  Jesus Christ.  This is everything we used to...  Amazing.  Yeah.  Sorry, but here we go again.  This is everything we used to have.  All we want is our shit back.  I remember that.  Oh, this is from last night.  Yeah.  Yeah, they put the clips up immediately.  Oh, yeah, of course.  Well, they're on the TV live.  Look at it.  That looks like a real TV show.  It's a TV shoot.  Yeah.  Because even the video we do shoot here doesn't look like that ever. 
[00:26:30]  That's pretty good.  And I mentioned the desk when I sat down, because they used to have a different desk where you  would face.  And I'm like, dude, why don't you get the new desk?  I love it.  And he goes, oh, well, that's just...  I asked them for it.  I thought it would be better if we faced the same way.  Wow.  He asked them and got it?  I thought he was going to slam DirecTV, because he goes, fucking DirecTV.  He goes, they do everything they say they're going to do.  Oh, boy.  It's really weird to have somebody that happy to work with.  Right.  Well, it's just weird to hear that.  Yeah.  Because we've been promised a lot of stuff, and none of it comes true. 
[00:27:00]  Remember, still talking about moving the wall.  The wall's still there.  Look at that.  I know.  The wall would give us, I don't know, maybe five more feet.  That still would be maybe an eighth of what Artie has.  That is...  And again, he has a loft downtown.  It's a different setup.  Yeah, but I've also talked about this with the guy down the hall.  I said, look, how about you just put us somewhere else in New York City?  How great would that be?  How good does that look?  It's amazing.  That's a professional fucking TV studio shoot. 
[00:27:30]  But when you look across the way...  It's got cool stuff.  There's like a Springsteen album in the background.  Yeah.  The river.  It just looks nice.  It's got that depth of field, whatever it is.  He's got little sign stuff on the...  Yes.  Now, across from where we are, because the deaths are all facing, that's where his bank of guys  is.  It's like three guys who he can talk to if he wants.  There's a big...  And beyond that, maybe five feet beyond that, ten feet beyond that is the stage, which is 
[00:28:00]  where Manas Yahu...  Is that how you say his name?  Manas Yahu.  I'm sorry.  Manas Yahu performed.  And then off to the far left, where we are, which would be the far right corner when  you walk in, is where Mike Buschetti sits.  And he just kind of hangs out, and he's got a big kitchen area.  He's got two hot twins that work for him.  And the girl's like, do you want me to make you a sandwich?  I'm like, nah, I just had a little bit of fucking...  We'll have sandwiches.  We'll have sandwiches.  And there's a big refrigerator with a sink area. 
[00:28:30]  And then when you walk in, like the back right corner of where the stage is, the right  side is where that ping pong table is, and a sitting area for the guests, where there  was a guy from St. Louis, a morning radio guy, who was on last night, and his wife was  in the studio.  She was fucking smoking hot.  So whenever you go in, they Mike everybody, just in case Artie wants to talk to them.  So, like, from where we are, across to the left, way across this giant loft is where 
[00:29:00]  the couch area is.  So this guy's hot wife there, you can see the guy, his wife is sitting there.  So at one point, Artie spoke to her, and she's all mic'd up, and she's on camera.  On camera immediately.  Immediately, they might have, I want to say there was at least three or four standing cameras,  and one guy walking around, and there's TV monitors all over.  It's an absolutely professional TV studio.  We set up a camera every once in a while, which means I can't move for an hour and a  half.  Right, because the tripod blocks you in. 
[00:29:30]  I'm not allowed to move.  Right.  I literally can't leave my seat for an hour and a half until the camera leaves the studio.  Amazing.  That stupid radio wizard.  Enough already with you.  We had, uh...  But I'm on to all of them, and that's why a couple of the other guys don't come around  as much, because I'm finally on to them.  Nothing is ever going to change.  So there's nothing you can say to my face that I'm going to listen to anymore.  It doesn't change at all.  But they have, like, a little thing in front of your stomach, a little black piece of tape 
[00:30:00]  that's kind of what they call your belly mark, which I kept forgetting about.  What is the song this guy sang last night?  Something about Be a Warrior?  Can you look that up, B-Rock?  I bet you it's called Be a Warrior.  It might be.  But I've never seen the footage of this.  Like, you know...  But that's what Artie's studio looks like.  I was on a modest Yahoo kick for a while.  Is this his performance, too?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Turn it up.  It's right up online.  Right up on YouTube.  Because he has a web team that works for him. 
[00:30:30]  This looks like you're watching Letterman or Leno.  Yeah.  And we are back here to the right.  Looks like a fucking boom shot.  And we had all this.  We just want our shit back.  Never going to happen.  I'm sorry.  Why?  Believe me, I...  It drives me nuts.  It drives me fucking berserk.  The first thing I want to think of when I walk in here.  This was 12 hours ago. 
[00:31:00]  And they're already up on YouTube.  What's our latest video on SiriusXM?  Let me give it a...  12 hours later.  12 hours ago, Modest Yahoo doing a performance on the Artie Lang show.  We can't really have musical performances on our show because we have nowhere to set up  the band, which we've said a million fucking times.  But they go, well, if the fishbowl's not being used, we can move you down there for musical  performances.  We can move you down there to take it. 
[00:31:30]  But half the time, the fucking fishbowl is being used, so that's a fucking...  We'll take you out of your element and put you in the fishbowl.  Right.  They left this...  Okay, that's fine.  No, it's not fine.  We had Anthony Bourdain, who's a massive fucking celebrity these days.  And we talked to him yesterday, so that video should be up immediately.  The last video we got is the Scientology girl who was...  You know, that was a great interview.  I think the web team filmed Anthony Bourdain.  Why?  I don't know.  We filmed it, though, right?  Yeah, we did.  Did the Radio Wizard go, hey, Sam, did you film Anthony Bourdain? 
[00:32:00]  Because I want to move that to our web team and put that up on the SiriusXM website immediately  because that's my job.  I got to make sure everything is being taken care of for you guys.  Oh, no.  Did that happen?  He didn't say that, no.  Yeah, of course not.  But he probably doesn't even know that we filmed Anthony Bourdain.  Does he understand that Anthony Bourdain is a big star?  He's going to be on CNN.  That's a big fucking deal.  And he has an ABC show called The Taste.  Oh, boy.  The...  And it's not even the entire interview. 
[00:32:30]  It's just a little...  But that makes you crazy, right?  Well...  That's what can be done.  And understandably, it makes the fans of our show crazy because here we go again.  But I don't know what else they need to hear.  Are they basically telling us to take this whole fucking show and do it ourselves?  Is that what they're saying?  Because if that's the case, then let us know.  At least we'll know where we stand.  This is ridiculous. 
[00:33:00]  I mean, Artie's been doing radio...  And someone called me out on this.  Artie Lang's been doing his own show for a year.  Oh, he's been doing it a long time than a year.  No, he's had his own show for basically a year.  Yeah, a year, year and a half.  That's what I'm getting at.  So relax.  It's unbelievable.  They don't listen.  They don't listen to people.  Yeah.  Then another broad goes, oh, your racism is showing since Patrice O'Neill died.  Because I agreed with that Jamie Foxx clip. 
[00:33:30]  So she thought I said that, you know, I'm questioning that black people could actually be talented.  I'm like, no, you stupid fuck.  What I said was that Jamie Foxx is saying they're the most talented people.  Oh, I would jump on that anyway.  And I disagreed with that, okay?  That's a huge fucking stage.  Because that's racist on his part.  Look at that stage.  The whole band is set up playing.  Of course.  They were there already.  The equipment was already set up and plugged in.  They just came up and fucking played.  Yeah, not only do they have, you know, production behind it, video production, they really know 
[00:34:00]  what they're doing.  These shots are amazing.  Sweeping.  Sweeping and moving.  Do they got a boom in there?  They might, yeah.  I don't remember.  I'm too busy being cute and sweet and networking.  But then Artie interviews him from across the room.  Oh, good for you.  He introduced him as the Jewish rapper, but then he realized this guy didn't rap.  Yeah.  So fucking, he was just bullshit, you know, giving his producer a bunch of shit.  Uh-huh.  But he's across, he's interviewing from 30 feet away. 
[00:34:30]  30 feet away.  That's crazy.  Oh, and the little sign when you walk in over the fucking desk area.  You know 30 feet away from you?  It's another studio.  It's Howard's studio.  Hold on, if I can find the little sign over when you walk in.  Oh, look at this.  This is above where we're sitting right there.  The sign.  It's like a marquee.  Tonight's guest.  Jim Norton. 
[00:35:00]  Music by Matsuyahu.  Or is it Matsuyahu?  I'm sorry, Matsuyahu.  How nice is that?  Right above you.  It's where they can film it.  Jeez.  Unbelievable.  Un-fucking-believable how cool that place is.  We have studio energy.  We get the Velcro wallpaper.  We do.  And it's not even hanging off the wall anymore.  That's right.  It was fixed.  Obviously, I don't expect a studio the size of that.  I do.  Because, well, the nature of this place up here, it's hard to pull that off.  Not really. 
[00:35:30]  But there's something much, much more they could do.  If they knocked this wall down, that would be plenty of space for us.  And it still would only be maybe a third of what he's got.  Not even.  Between these two studios?  A quarter?  Maybe a quarter.  All right.  But that's all we would want.  That's fine.  Yeah.  We would be able to do a lot more things for the company.  Not just for ourselves.  For the company.  It would be so much easier to book music guests.  We got guys that squeeze into that tiny corner.  They can't even bring in their drums.  So there's always an idiot playing a pod or something. 
[00:36:00]  Because he doesn't want to feel useless.  Spackle bucket.  We had to squeeze Train in there.  Train's like one of the biggest bands there is.  Yeah, Train had a hell of a fucking run.  And they were squeezed in the corner.  And the drummer wasn't allowed to.  What did he play that day?  He played a wooden box.  It was, right?  Yeah, he played a wooden fucking box.  Three feet away, there's a mixing board on a chair.  It's just fucked.  We used to have all this shit 10, 12 years ago. 
[00:36:30]  We had our foosball table and all sorts of shit.  Stop whining about the show you could do and do a fucking show.  I think we do a show every day, loser.  Oh, Adam.  Adam from the UK.  We do a show every day.  These English motherfuckers always have some problem with everything that goes on here in the States.  Well, go listen to their local radio.  Go turn on your BBCs.  It's funny how anything can be insulting, by the way.  It doesn't matter even if it's legit. 
[00:37:00]  Go watch CNN.  Yeah, go to Harvard.  It's all in the delivery.  It's all in the delivery.  I didn't mean to stir shit.  But the minute I walked in, I just got annoyed.  I saw that he tweeted it, and I'm like, oh boy, this will be an issue tomorrow on the show.  I mean, we can't help that one.  Yeah.  It was a fun happen.  You just happen to do it.  Yeah.  Well, we got the wrong guys that are looking out for the show. 
[00:37:30]  Period.  You get any info last night?  I did not, no.  Because I only saw, when I came in, well, there's a little, when you walk in, right,  there's a whole technical area, like, you know, back behind the scenes, you know, wire,  whatever they have, a TV monitors area.  And then there's, like, a little hallway where the guests can sit, and there's a bathroom  and stuff, before you even walk in the studio.  So Artie was already in the studio.  I got there just about 10, so he was starting off with his, the guy who was co-hosting for 
[00:38:00]  the night with him.  So I didn't get a chance to really talk to him alone at all.  Gotcha.  I only saw him in there, and we were just talking about doing the gigs.  He takes breaks?  Yeah.  And what do they play during the breaks?  I don't know.  Well, I'm guessing the radio commercials, and then whatever they do on satellite, I'm  not sure, and then the TV commercials.  And he'll come back and throw to something once in a while.  And there's times where they'll go, hey, we're on a live shot, so we'll be doing something.  Like, we were talking to Buschetti and making a sandwich, and they just came with a camera  and they're doing a live shot.  Without any audio?  Yeah, I don't know what's, maybe that's to sync it up with radio or something. 
[00:38:30]  I don't know.  Why is this place just allowing everyone else to just pass them by?  It's humiliating.  Excuse me.  They had such a big lead on everyone.  You don't feel that anymore when you come in here.  Not even a little.  Oh, boy.  No.  And they had a huge lead.  Even regular radio's catching up with what they're doing online and stuff.  Yeah.  It's unbelievable.  Oh.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Someone is saying they have more info on your Richard Dreyfuss thing. 
[00:39:00]  What?  Yeah, I'm going to go with this for a second.  Joe in Jersey.  Joe.  Hey, Ant.  Joey.  I wonder if Richard Dreyfuss knows exactly what joke you were saying, but he was responding  from dialogue from another fucking movie.  Was he doing this, or are you wondering this?  I was wondering it, because it would be great if he was doing shit from, like...  Well, it would be great.  Close Encounters. 
[00:39:30]  They did have that weird line in Close Encounters when he said, I can't decipher your tweet.  Yes, yes.  Remember that one?  1977.  Well, I certainly apologize to the room and the audience, because what it says on the  line is, Richard Dreyfuss is fucking with Anthony with lines from obscure movies.  Who's doing the...  Now, that would be a lot different than what this guy's saying, right?  Who's on the phones?  Yeah.  That was misleading.  I bet it's Sal.  Sal!  Sal on the phone?  Who's on the phone?  Who's on the phone?  Manny or Sal? 
[00:40:00]  Every time.  Every time.  E-Rock, what's going on in there?  No, Sal was on.  Oh, no.  He stepped out for a second, but he was on.  Where does he have to go?  I think he went to the bathroom.  The closet?  Oh, no.  He's working in the back on...  No, there he is.  Papa Rock.  Oh, there he is.  He's just wandering down the hall.  What's going on in this place?  Why isn't Sal on the phones?  He was.  Yeah.  And when in the back there, he was going to cut up some of the Papa Rock stuff.  Oh, boy.  I don't want him cutting up our audio. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, but you don't want him streaming in the calls, either.  He's misleading.  He is misleading.  Oh, my God.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  But your call was a waste of time.  It certainly was.  He's presenting a theory that is very unlikely and just no reason to interrupt a flow of conversation with him.  But Sal made it sound like that's exactly what he was doing, and thus then, if I dare say, the reason why we take that phone call.  Precisely.  This show was just moving along like a racing bicycle, and Sal threw a stick in the spoke. 
[00:41:00]  Yes, he is the stick in the spokes.  Asshole.  By the way, another part of the problem is the radio.  I called our agent.  I had another question for him.  How's he doing?  Well, I luckily have my old phone there, because that's what he still calls.  And I said, you've got to lose this.  I keep that for people.  I've got to get rid of my old phone.  Because, you know, fucking dumb Louie will still call my 201 number.  Yeah.  But, you know, Louie's not my agent, unfortunately.  Wouldn't things be better? 
[00:41:30]  But, I mean, your agent is supposed to know your actual fucking phone number.  Your real phone number, right.  How is Bob?  I haven't talked to him since October, I think.  He's good.  He's good?  Yeah.  That's good.  I hope he's enjoying his life as we just sit here and rot in the mud.  Mm-hmm.  I really want to interview this fucking guy who killed bin Laden.  Yeah.  How do we get this done?  He was all over TV yesterday.  What a weird story.  The guy that took out bin Laden is saying he has no pension, and he's out of the service, 
[00:42:00]  right?  Wow.  Yeah, I guess he...  I don't understand that.  His time was up.  He cut out early.  Oh, did he?  He left early.  Why do you think he...  I wonder if that was because you just get tired of just...  You want to be famous for this.  I guess he wanted to be with his family, he said.  He also said that there's some issues with a neck and an eye problem or something, and...  Plus, he killed bin Laden, so to him it's like, what else can I do in this career path?  I think I'm going to move on to something else.  Yeah. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, so, uh...  I guess they have their rules.  I don't know.  Even for the guy that killed bin Laden?  Even for the guy that killed bin Laden.  I don't think they...  I don't think they put any credence in, you know, one thing over another kind of a thing.  You know, you killed bin Laden, or...  Yeah, you're fucking running the motor pool.  You know, one or the other.  It's still...  You're doing your job.  I like to think that we live in a world where the guy that killed bin Laden just has that  special card that gets him to do whatever the fuck he wants. 
[00:43:00]  Well...  You just pull out that card, and everyone just knows.  If he would have done it in the early part of the 21st century...  Oh, my God, yeah.  Then I think there would have been a lot more celebration for this gentleman.  But, then again, a lot of things have changed since 9-11, 2001.  Until now, people don't give a shit anymore.  They just are like, bah, whatever.  So, what's up with this guy? 
[00:43:30]  He has no money?  He's just...  Well, he's describing...  One line he said when he was describing himself walking into the place, into the room.  Pretty cool.  He said, as the mission started, he felt a strange calm.  For some reason, I said to myself, the George Bush 9-11 quote, freedom itself was attacked  this morning by a faceless coward, and freedom will be defended, he said.  I could just hear his voice, and that was neat.  I started saying it again and again to myself, then I started to get pumped up.  I'm like, this is so on.  That is so the way a young American guy talks. 
[00:44:00]  So on, motherfucker.  This is so on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's not that young, though.  How old is he?  63.  Oh, see, I would have thought younger.  Yeah, yeah.  I didn't know that.  You'd think, you know?  Whoa.  He's 63 for real?  No.  All right, you scared me.  No, because...  Oh, literal.  No, you gotta see his picture.  He looks a little older.  They show his picture?  I thought so.  I don't think so.  What was I looking at?  That was Bin Laden.  Oh, fuck.  No, this guy's anonymous.  He won't...  Yeah.  Eventually, I'll bet you his name comes out, because you have to want to be famous. 
[00:44:30]  Right, right, right.  Who the fuck was on TV yesterday, then?  The journalist who interviewed him.  Oh, that's what it was.  I was talking about Esquire.  You're wondering what Diane Sawyer shot?  It's a little femmy.  No, I had the TV on, the audio down, and I was just kind of reading the graphics, and  I thought that was the guy.  And then I even thought to myself, that's fucking crazy that he would be showing his  face, so now it all makes sense, and I apologize.  All right.  Wow, Khalid, come here.  Wow.  And he was an older gentleman.  He went in there. 
[00:45:00]  A lot of that White House bullshit was bullshit.  He didn't have a gun.  He didn't reach for an AK-47, like the White House was saying.  He actually was holding his wife in front of him, and this guy walked into the room, looked  at him, instantly recognized the fact that it was him, and immediately, immediately pegged  him once in the forehead. 
[00:45:30]  As he was going down, he hit him again in the head, and then once he hit the ground,  he shot him again.  And you can only imagine, Bin Laden was probably like on, I wish I had a taller wife.  Because Bin Laden's a very tall gentleman.  He's probably got his hands on the petite woman's shoulders.  All right, he probably won't shoot.  He was cowering behind a crane.  He said he shot him twice in the forehead, and he said his head split like a V.  Yeah, his brains came out.  And he said, I could see his brains leaking out onto his face. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, there was no...  You gotta wonder, the way he describes it, there was absolutely no take this guy alive.  Not at all.  They just said, hit him with a lightsaber.  Oh, wait, wrong.  Hit him with a blaster.  There he goes, O'Bee.  There he goes.  He's very nice.  I fucking love the guy.  He's hilarious.  Yeah.  He's taking his punishment.  He really is.  He's getting his shit back together.  He really is.  Okay, he's going by the office. 
[00:46:30]  The call out was one of the best combat moves.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, wow, when the guy called out Khalid.  He was saying it was genius.  He said the guy in front of him, like the point man, he said, who's Bin Laden's son was Khalid.  He goes, I heard him whisper, Khalid, come here in Arabic, then in Pashto.  He used his name.  That confused Khalid, the SEAL told the magazine.  He's probably thinking, I just heard shitty Arabic and shitty Pashto.  Who the fuck is this?  This was the SEAL speculating on what Khalid was thinking.  He leaned out, armed with an AK, and he got blasted by the point man. 
[00:47:00]  And then this guy says, that call out was one of the best combat moves I've ever seen.  Wow.  That's fucking badass.  Fuck, man.  You know what?  It really is amazing that they went into an armed fucking compound and didn't take any fucking casualties.  Amazing.  Killed everyone with a gun in that jerk.  And then killed Bin Laden.  And perfectly had everything. 
[00:47:30]  Like when you saw Zero Dark Thirty.  I did not.  Oh, the scene where they showed, it's exactly how I pictured it.  Fucking cool.  Very cool.  Oh, you saw it, right?  Yeah, yeah.  It's like a little confusing.  They show him calling Khalid, but you can just kind of see him.  Yeah, and then they had to improvise a few things because nothing ever goes exactly like planned.  Well, obviously the helicopter, one of them crashed.  Sure.  But yeah, nothing ever goes as planned.  They couldn't breach one of the doorways that they needed to breach, so they had to kind of improvise. 
[00:48:00]  It was pretty cool.  He said, on the third floor, my point man tackled two women in the hallway.  He thought he was going to absorb the blast of suicide vests.  He was going to kill himself so I could get the shot.  It was the most heroic thing I've ever seen.  These guys really thought that everybody in the compound would have, especially by the time they got up to Bin Laden,  because they're blasting for ten minutes.  Yeah, yeah, trying to get up there.  And fuck it, he's just up in his room.  He can't see what's happening.  He's got no windows.  So they're assuming they're strapping up. 
[00:48:30]  Man.  They were, uh, there was one of the teams who was supposed to rappel down from the roof.  So they were supposed to be on the third floor right away from that other helicopter,  but that's the one that crashed.  Crashed, so they had to make their way upstairs.  So yeah, it was like ten minutes of shooting their way in and blasting doors open.  Trying to blast in and they couldn't, like the one blast wouldn't open this joint.  Wouldn't open the door, yeah.  So they had to go around and the other team which blasted through it.  It was a loud fucking operation.  And the whole time Bin Laden's just upstairs going, oh fuck. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, he knew him.  Here it is.  Here it is.  All these years later and they fucking finally got me.  He was probably asleep.  Oh, here it is.  Oh, shit.  Here it comes.  I think he was relieved slightly because he's living his life wondering when that day was  coming.  Probably wondering every day when that was going to happen.  And he was just this, uh, the guy said he was, uh, he was taller than he imagined.  Uh, but he was very skinny and frail. 
[00:49:30]  His beard was shorter, but he knew it was him.  And again, what I was saying before was the fact that the fact that he instantly shot him  in the head.  Uh, they weren't trying to get this guy alive.  This was a fucking go in and assassinate this motherfucker.  That's it.  So when is this guy going to start doing interviews?  I think now, again, I don't know why he's out of the service and he's got nothing.  And this is how stupid the fucking government is. 
[00:50:00]  This is what dummies these guys are.  You're forcing this guy to come out and just be famous.  And, uh, because he, you can't leave this guy destitute, you dumb motherfuckers.  Yeah.  He, I don't care if it was just his mission.  He killed the most wanted man in the world.  He deserves something for that.  And, uh, what kind of shitty messages that to the rest of the soldiers do, do this, go  into a foreign country, all these years train, and you're going to come out with dick and 
[00:50:30]  he can't even use his fucking who he is on his resume.  So they should have a way of getting these guys special jobs somehow associated with  the government, um, where he's well paid for the rest of his life and taken care of.  And it's not necessarily, you know, a military, but they're just cocksuckers and they don't,  they don't do that for their guys.  Didn't he say he was frustrated by the attention everyone else was getting from the mission?  I don't blame him.  He was frustrated how the White House was getting a lot of attention and others. 
[00:51:00]  It's funny how congressmen always have health coverage, don't they?  Don't these fucking bags of shit take care of themselves once they get out?  Once they're done, they have fucking health coverage for life?  A guy like that at the very least should have health insurance for the rest of his life.  Ah, it sickens me.  It's amazing.  You would think it would be different, but it's not.  I was under the impression the guy that killed Bin Laden was, uh, going to be speaking  publicly tonight.  The State of the Union address.  No, well, that guy did do a great job of authorizing it.  Uh...  Oh, God.  Fucking bullshit.  I still...  More bullshit. 
[00:51:30]  Praise Obama.  They even said, he even said, it was 100% when they were told that this motherfucker was  in that house.  Not, not 60%, not that where, where, uh, Bin Laden, yeah.  Where Obama had to say, uh, well, I gotta make the call.  Ah, I'll tell you about it.  This was such a hype job.  This was a military operation.  Uh, yes, he's the commander in chief.  But, um, as far as making the decision to go in and get Bin Laden, stop it. 
[00:52:00]  I'm never gonna agree with, with that this was a bold move on, on Obama's part.  But they...  Stop the most wanted man in the world.  Of course you're gonna try everything.  If they said he was at the castle at Disneyland, you'll fucking go into the castle at Disney.  But other guys fucked up, like, you know, like, and didn't do what was necessary.  And I don't know if Bush would have done that.  I don't know if he would have went into Pakistan.  Yes.  And Abbottabad and fucking got them.  With the intelligence they had on this motherfucker, abso-fucking-lutely they would have gone in 
[00:52:30]  and done it.  Especially before an election.  Well...  A speck of jelly.  But I, I don't 100% agree.  Because, again, it, it, you, it could be...  I, 110%.  It costs Carter his presidency.  The second presidency.  Because he was seen as a bungler.  And Obama is, is a very, very liberal guy coming after a very conservative president.  Well...  And if he had fucked this up, it would have been another left-wing, tax-and-spend, weak Democrat... 
[00:53:00]  I mean, that's how it would have looked, though.  No, he wouldn't have.  I think so.  This guy's fucking brilliant at deflecting the bad shit.  He didn't do it.  And, and, and, and, and absorbing any good thing that happens.  Look at Benghazi.  Who's he?  This motherfucker, Benghazi.  Hey, man.  Look at Benghazi.  His fucking watch.  His fucking watch.  September fucking 11th.  An anniversary of September 11th.  An embassy in a hostile fucking place doesn't have the security that the poor motherfuckers were asking for. 
[00:53:30]  And he skates on it.  Doesn't even fucking faze him.  The Teflon fucking you-know-what.  That's what's, that's terrible.  He bungled that.  That was bungled by Hillary.  But he's not fucking taking any responsibility for it.  But the media's not killing him for it.  That's not his fault.  Of course the media's not.  Because they're in cahoots with this fucking guy.  But, that, even, just because you are right, they should be killing him for that.  By the way, they should be killing Hillary for that.  And she fucking, she was like Peter Finch in Network.  Figuratively speaking. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, well, of course.  I think we all know that.  But, you know, you see her testifying.  Oh, yeah.  What difference?  I know.  I'm as ugly as hell.  And I'm not going to take this anymore.  I want you to get up on your fat cankles.  I'm as ugly as hell.  And I'm not going to take this anymore.  Anymore?  Anymore?  But, but I agree with that.  But that, those things that aren't mutually exclusive, like, I still will always think 
[00:54:30]  that he did something that was, that was good.  And if it had been, believe me, a hardcore Republican, I would have felt exactly the same  way if Bush had done it.  Exactly the same way.  It was a ballsy move.  I love it.  It wasn't a ballsy move.  But I would have felt it was because anytime you do something with a guy, with an ally like  Pakistan, who's a dog shit ally.  Ally.  Yeah, exactly.  Dog shit ally.  Who's been fucking jerking us the whole time with this Bin Laden shit.  So who's been handling them with kid gloves?  It was Bush.  He was handling them with kid gloves.  And our military handled them with kid gloves.  You're going to just have to live with this one, Ant. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  I know.  I have to.  I got a bigger question.  You're going to sit there and make it like this, like Obama's the big fucking hero.  Excuse me.  You've made it loud and clear.  Loud and clear.  Loud and clear.  They're hearing you.  Exactly.  I got a bigger question for you.  Yeah.  If they get a black pope in there, will your head explode?  Yes.  I need to know.  I need to know.  Yes.  Because they're leaning toward a black pope.  Jamie Foxx gloating.  But they're leaning toward the black pope. 
[00:55:30]  How wonderful black people are.  He's in the lead.  What?  They're saying the black pope.  Is he in the lead?  Ghana, right?  The Ghana guy.  Well, you know what?  Good.  I say just to let black people take everything over.  Well, there's never been a black pope.  Let him just run everything.  You're going to be all right with that, though?  Let's see how that works out.  What's his name?  Howard something or whatever?  Howard.  There can't be any worse than what they're doing with the white pope.  Stop it!  Yeah.  Yeah, let's be honest.  What's a black pope going to do that's worse than the Inquisition and covering up boy fucking  Oh, please. 
[00:56:00]  Right.  There's plenty of fucking...  That guy.  Right there.  He looks like Hank Errin.  I'm sorry.  Peter what?  I'm sorry.  Peter Turkson from Ghana.  No, that's Hank Errin.  Hank Errin might be the next fucking pope, man.  He looks like a guy.  He's the guy.  They're starting to say he's the guy.  His mother, I think, was a Catholic.  His father was a Methodist.  He was kind of born to do this.  And he's been a...  What was he?  Since 75, he's been a priest?  He's been around?  But that means anyone that's been around in the 70s, you got a question.  He can't do any worse than the white popes have done. 
[00:56:30]  What Catholicism is now, which is you think priest, you think boy fucker.  Yeah.  How did they get to that point?  You guys ran the world.  All the fucking boys.  But the 70s was...  How did they resist?  But the 70s was the era of the boy fucking.  So anybody that was a priest in the 70s, you got to wonder what the fuck they knew.  Where was he a priest most of his time there?  In Africa?  This guy?  I'm going to guess Ghana.  I don't know. 
[00:57:00]  But they've been fucking boys forever, man.  They said they had stuff going back for 400.  You know that girl Rhea?  Rhea.  Oh, Danny DeVito's ex-wife.  No, she's from Ghana.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Holy fucking shit, you drippy cocksucker.  No, that was a good one.  Fucking Rhea Ghana.  Rhea Ghana shopping.  Fucking home run, Kumiya.  Oh, Chip, it was the other way around.  Holy shit. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, Chip.  Rhea Ghana gets you.  Holy fucking shit.  Don't stop me.  I'll be here all day.  Take us out, you Ghana Rhea.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  People saying going into Pakistan was a bold move.  And people always disagree.  If they had screwed up that mission, we would have never heard about it.  And Clint in Cleveland, I don't know who he's referring to here, so we're going to take  this call before break.  Clint, what's up?  Yeah, wasn't there a massive bounty on Bin Laden's head?  Why is this soldier not eligible for that? 
[00:58:00]  Get taken care of that way.  I know, dude.  They don't give him that.  No, it's his job.  But that shows you, by the way, how loyal his people were.  $25 million bounty on him.  $25 million bounty on, I think, Ayman Al-Zohari, and they can't get him.  And I think it might have gotten, oh, the Ron Jeremy, he's a Sheikh Khaled Mohammed.  It might have gotten him, but these two top guys, the bounty did not get them.  But you would think there would be some kind of bonus for a job well done.  Right? 
[00:58:30]  Something.  Yeah.  Yeah, there is.  More dog shit treatment from the government.  It's fucking terrible.  Of course.  Yeah.  All right, thank you, Clint.  Unbelievable.  Like, I get that you're in the military.  You're doing what you're told.  That's what military guys do.  But how do you not, how do you let this guy go without making him feel special?  I mean, come on, man.  Yeah.  We're going to hear more about this in the coming weeks, I'm sure.  Unless the government gets to him now and goes, hey, how about we fucking work out something  because we don't really want you.  TCB?  What?  They take care of business. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, I thought the ogre.  I just realized Ant was making fun of my shirt earlier, and he's wearing a t-shirt that  says, inspected for awesomeness.  Ew.  So.  I didn't.  Inspected for awesomeness.  Ew.  U.S. Department of Agriculture, P69.  69.  Oh, what a douche.  What is that?  Uh, inspected for awesomeness.  Inspected for awesomeness.  Ew.  By the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  That's fucking gross.  Thank you. 
[00:59:30]  But you're not awesome.  That's not an awesome shirt.  I'm so awesome.  I'm inspected for awesomeness.  They should have a big fail across it.  I'm awesome.  Inspected.  That's a great t-shirt.  All right, look.  It's laundry day.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  Are you washing your cool as a cucumber sweatshirt?  Why don't we go to break with some Modest Yahoo?  Did you find that song you rock or no?  We're just going to play the big hit just to get everyone on the same page. 
[01:00:00]  And then we can play the old one later.  What's the big hit?  I don't know.  It's like Arnold's.  King Without a Crown was his number one.  This was his big hit.  Born to be bad t-shirt in the movie.  Wearing his Robert Duvall hat.  Ah, boy.  Yeah.  Let's do Modest Yahoo.  We'll be back.  All right.  Hit this.  Hit this. 
[01:00:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:01:00]  Sing to my God.  Some's all have been healing.  I want Misiach now.  Time it starts to be.  What's this feeling?  I love who rip a hole in the ceiling.  I give myself to you from the essence of my being.  And I sing to my God.  Some's all have been healing.  I want Misiach now.  Slip away the legs and reveal your soul.  You gotta give yourself up and then you become whole. 
[01:01:30]  You're a slave to yourself and them don't even know.  Them others have lived a fast life but your dream moves low.  You can't shine and stay high.  Bounce to stay low.  You want God but you can't afflict your ego.  You're already there.  Then there's nowhere to go.  Your cup's already full.  Then it's bound to overflow.  If you're dawning in the waters and you can't stay afloat.  Ask your shams for mercy.  They'll throw you a rope.  You're looking for help from God.  Say he couldn't leave down.  Searching up to the sky.  Looking beneath the ground.  Like a king without his crown.  You keep falling down.  You really want to leave. 
[01:02:00]  But can I get rid of your crown?  You're trying to reach on to the heights.  And run down bound on the ground.  Beeping up your pride.  Then you hear the sound.  Out of night comes day.  Out of day comes light.  And I'm flying to the one light.  So light in the rain.  Making room for peace love.  Then the fire can blaze.  Make room for peace love.  Then the fire can blaze.  Watch this ceiling.  My love will rip a hole in the ceiling.  I give myself to you from the essence of my being.  And I sing to my God.  Some's a love and healing.  I want Mashiach now.  Time it starts to be in.  Watch this ceiling.  My love will rip a hole in the ceiling.  I give myself to you from the essence of my being. 
[01:02:30]  And I sing to my God.  Some's a love and healing.  I want Mashiach now.  We'll be right back. 
[01:03:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:03:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:04:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:04:30]  It's not exciting.  Look, have fun with your little gay thing, and then we're moving on from gay.  Fuck yeah.  We're officially moving on from gay.  We're saying farewell to the gay.  Absolutely.  Who was the ZMF?  Yeah.  Right?  Whatever happened to that weird English accent in songs?  It went away.  Tell me the laws.  There's a lot of guys that used to sound like that.  They're all gone now. 
[01:05:00]  We're going to be hitting on the fact that Michael McDonald's birthday is today.  Is it really?  I...  I...  I...  He's got a great voice.  Who are you kidding?  What a fool believes to be in the one that has the power. 
[01:05:30]  How does he hit that note?  Oh, no.  That's pretty amazing.  Is he still doing it?  Uh...  I think so.  Sure.  Still hitting those notes?  How old is Michael McDonald?  61, I think.  Oh, that's it?  I would think he was older.  Yeah?  But then again, he went gray at, what, 22 years old or something?  He was fucking, like, gray in that goddamn, uh...  What fucking show is he in? 
[01:06:00]  What's Happening?  Episode of What's Happening?  You're the only one that knows that.  Oh, did you know that?  I remember that.  We were talking about it last night.  When Rerun dropped the tape recorder.  We thought you were our friend, Rerun.  Ah.  Yeah.  What song is this?  No, he was in that episode?  What song is this, he wrote?  I believe.  This is, it's another one that said it was a big hit for him, so...  But why would you play the one that...  Nah.  I grabbed this one.  Well, it's just dark.  What a fool believes.  Why would you play the one that was...  Oh, my God.  Imitating.  This isn't the fucking strong rock. 
[01:06:30]  This does nothing for us.  He's dumbfoot.  Oh, Iraq.  I got a good correction, by the way, from Jesse.  He says, how can you say Bush wouldn't have pulled the trigger on Bin Laden with his info?  He invaded Iraq with no info.  Good one.  Take that.  That's good.  Bravo.  Is it too late to do the Michael McDonald thing?  Never too late.  And I didn't realize he was actually in that episode.  Yeah, he was kind of a background guy. 
[01:07:00]  He was background guy.  Yeah, he was in the background song.  Why would you make a background guy?  Uh, I don't know.  I...  It was a weird transitional point for the doobies.  He has that voice.  He has that voice.  Watched in her life.  She must have smiled for his nostalgia tear. 
[01:07:30]  Boy, he's a bad piece of shit now, isn't he?  So we don't want to wake the neighbors?  Can we turn this up, please?  What's the matter?  Here it comes.  This is some popular fucking shit back in... 
[01:08:00]  Sam is smirking over there.  Why are you smirking, Sam?  It sucks.  Well, yeah.  I don't know.  It's called the guilty pleasure.  It's horrible.  I don't fucking listen to this shit.  But this was the equivalent to like...  Yes, thanks.  This wasn't like guys rocking fucking holding up, you know, fucking devil horns when the song's playing.  This was your kind of...  What is this?  Adult contemporary back in the day. 
[01:08:30]  A little AC, they called it.  A little AC.  A little ADL cunt.  That's what they call it in the business.  It's called AC.  AC.  Hits of Yesterday and Today.  Yes, that's what it was.  This was your parents' music, you know.  Before we move on, what was your favorite Doobie Brothers song?  Oh my God.  I don't know if I have a favorite.  China Grove?  Well, probably not.  I go Blackwater myself.  Blackwater, definitely.  You know the song?  That's what they sang.  Oh, Blackwater.  Oh, Blackwater. 
[01:09:00]  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I want to say that's what they sang on What's Happening.  Maybe Sam can find the What's Happening clip online.  I think it was my favorite Doobie Brothers song.  She wasn't busy over there fucking, you know, reading comic books.  Maybe you can find...  Fan fiction?  Yeah.  Bikini pictures?  What is it today?  Exactly.  Stop rifling through Hulk's fucking biography.  Although, E-Rock had a very funny tweet when all that gay shit was going down.  Oh, that was a good one.  That picture?  He had a picture of a bikini girl on his computer, and in the background was some really gay shit going on. 
[01:09:30]  Man-ass.  And then what was your tweet about that?  Something along the lines of all my bikini...  Thanks.  Thanks.  You just deflated him.  Impossible.  I'm sorry, Eric.  You can never give him one, huh?  No, go ahead, Eric.  Give E-Rock one.  Come on.  Go ahead, HB.  Let's give him one.  We're all on the same page.  I'm looking it up here.  It was about...  And the show gives me shit for bikini girls.  Yeah.  It was funny.  I laughed.  This is a good song.  I love this song.  Yeah, this is...  You like this one at least, Sam? 
[01:10:00]  You don't do the AC at all, huh?  This is very good.  What the fuck's wrong with you?  Is that the What's Happening episode?  I guess so.  Let me see.  What the fuck's wrong with me, because I don't listen to Michael McDonald?  No Harry.  No Harry.  No Harry.  Wait, can we see what...  Can we see...  All right, yeah, yeah.  This is the What's Happening episode.  All right, here we go.  God.  If these guys would ever be listening to the Doobie Brothers.  Yeah, what the fuck are the Doobie Brothers doing in the hood?  I'd like to thank you all for coming. 
[01:10:30]  It's been really great being back at the old high school.  Right, because they went to high school in Compton.  Went to a black high school?  Come on.  Learned a lot about geometry, history.  In phys ed, I learned how to wrestle a girl into the backseat of my car.  Whoa!  He's killing.  That's fucking hilarious.  Seriously, I got my love of music right here at this school.  Roger, do you want to do your clapping?  It's important to stay here and learn and experience things, so stick with it.  The liberal drummer had the pipe up. 
[01:11:00]  Shut up.  Okay.  So, we're going to go on to our next song, so if anybody feels like getting up and dancing,  do it.  All right.  Oh, what do they dance to?  One of the great black and roll mustaches of all time, by the way.  Yeah.  I always forget that guy's dance.  They're out of the way out.  Yes.  You dance to this?  You don't know me, but I'm gonna run.  We're just doing this to win.  Annoy Sam. 
[01:11:30]  Look at Michael McDonald's hair.  It's like black.  Uh-oh, reruns gonna get up.  Oh, shit, he's gonna get up.  Right there, he's down dead.  Look at Michael McDonald's hair.  It's black.  What happened?  you don't know  my time  that's ridiculous  what?  that's a great voice  take it to the streets  now that's where it goes  tell me the things  you wanna do for me 
[01:12:00]  that's okay  okay it's a great song  big harmony  oh yeah this is good  I like this  oh they're all dancing  this rerun  this is crazy  rerun starts doing his  rerun dance  but he's got a tape recorder  heavy jacket on  like of a Donald  big 70s beard  it smells worse than a giant fat guy dancing  in a heavy coat 
[01:12:30]  I wanna see the thing fall out  I think they get the doobie brothers  to play this song  and they play the whole song on the episode  that's so weird  that's how they got the doobie brothers  right there  oh now he's gonna dance  yeah  oh he's standing right in front  but he was forced to bootleg the concert  by some unscrupulous guy  yeah  so now they're all standing up dancing  yeah  after this nine minute thing  camera's zooming in on Fatto 
[01:13:00]  I like when Michael McDonald drops the N-bomb  saying that  he's jumping up and down  cheering  oh yeah yeah  oh shit  oh no  watch this  the recorder fell out  they're all pointing at it  the recorder is  uh oh  and he put it back in his pocket  and the whole place is quiet  uh oh  this could be a problem  bootlegging  see my question is  how did people in the back know  the recorder had fallen  to stop clapping  uh oh  I thought you guys were our friends 
[01:13:30]  how could you guys do this to us  this is so bad  we were forced  oh show you what  the guy gave us the recorder  oh yeah  I saw the story on first 48 too  uh  reruns pulling  I didn't do nothing  see the D's always funny  I love D  and how do I know  what would you do if you were in our shoes  well I just sent us home  and laughed it off  oh man  Raj makes me laugh  not funny  why is he still wearing the dumb hat 
[01:14:00]  I didn't think so either  oh Raj  we really work for us  they said if we didn't do it  they'd hurt us  hey you expect us to believe that  look  he may be dumb  but he doesn't lie  what was his name  Al Dunbar by any chance  yeah  how'd you know  he was the lowlife  that recorded our concert  in St. Louis  oh no  and our L.A. concert  and moving up on the charts  was a Jefferson High concert  number 40  with three bullets  he just records  dumb  do we brother  let Al Dunbar 
[01:14:30]  make a couple of bucks  how much could he be making  off this shit  really off a cassette copy  yeah an obese man  with a fucking  recorder on his belt  dancing  yeah we wouldn't want  to disappoint a man  oh the doobies  have to bust this whole thing up  yeah  should we call the police first  no I think we'd like a bite to eat  maybe we'll stop by the soda shop  oh the doobies  are gonna kick some  come by the soda shop  you don't wanna go by the soda shop  on an empty stomach  and they're gonna see  Shirley Hensel  we're gonna swing by  and bring Mabel King  some new legs  I just 
[01:15:00]  Mabel King  I was thinking the whole  whole time about something  and of course  Buzzy  writes me  he goes  he writes  did Rerun have a wheelchair handy  and I wrote too bad  yeah that would've been  a good way to bootleg  the opster helped bootleg  some concerts  with Buzzy  why did  we would hollow out wheelchairs  I haven't told the story in a while  fucking Buzzy was brilliant at it  fucking  he was all about  bootlegging Springsteen shows  and he made a buck 
[01:15:30]  he would show up  at the  the rat  at Geneseo  with a whole list  of  of shows you could buy  he had  he had everything  you could imagine  there was a whole little network  worked with other people  good thing he didn't bootleg  the doobies  they'd come after you  oh shit  they meet you at the soda shop  they go to the soda shop  and fucking kick your ass  they don't even need the cops  wasn't a guy named Buzzy  was it  Buzzy was so ballsy  he brought in a tripod  into the concerts  a fucking tripod 
[01:16:00]  to set up the camera  so the shot was nice  oh I thought he just had  a big dick  tripod  oh I thought man  he was a pod  and he was a little hungry  and then he would put  a coat around the tripod  then he would put  a baseball hat  over the camera  and it looked like  it was just a dude  enjoying the concert  it looked like fucking  the tweaky from Buck Rogers  was watching his show  a little red light  was that his name  because now  when you talk about  bootlegging  and everyone does  it doesn't fucking matter  but back in the day  it was very illegal  and the equipment  was way too fucking big 
[01:16:30]  rerun drops his iphone  we thought you guys  were our friends  yeah right  isn't it amazing  how the whole concert  just stopped  you think that's cheesy  yeah of course it is  it's terrible  you guys are very well  informed for children  of the 80s  stop  yeah this was like  well thank you sam  I appreciate that  well what do you know  about shows  when you grew up  exactly  mr. don't know  anything about shows  when he grew up  yeah  mr. who's doing  the exact same thing  we're doing  I told you  closer to 30  than fucking 
[01:17:00]  exactly  I'm way out of this  conversation  stop with this young  kid fucking  young wet behind the ears  king shit  that ain't happening  for you either  you're not appley-cheeked  you got three children  yeah look at you  the older that I get  you guys get even older  yeah yeah  but I don't feel like  we can get candy  out of your head anymore  let's just put it that way  no fucking way  that head that has  a permanent fucking  five o'clock shadow  on it  like Fred Flintstone  there was a time  we really thought  we could get candy  out of that head of yours  your young twinkish days  are over my friend 
[01:17:30]  that's right  over  you're an old old fay  you are  yeah bootlegging  concerts were fun  back in the day  when's the  when's the big birthday  mine?  September  September 6th  40 huh?  30 will be my  what?  at the time  oh stop  you know it doesn't matter  once the 30 mark  is hit  it's just  that's it  then no one goes like  oh you're 35  like 20  and 25  people are like  yeah I'm 25  it doesn't matter 
[01:18:00]  and then 40  it doesn't matter  once you cross that line  which you are  oh so fucking close to  I tell people  I'm 44 and a half  ah that's a good one  Jimmy  I'm old I am  and a half  what a door  how old are you?  44 and a half  and a half  I'm this many  yeah I'm this many  oh  I am being reminded  I was guilty of this  when I used to do  rock radio  but a lot of DJs  did this one 
[01:18:30]  the guy writes  I'd like to remind you  that they aren't  related  but they do  be brothers  ooh  oh  that's what the DJs  used to say  that's how you  intro the fucking  do be brothers  they are related  but they do  be brothers  here's taking it  to the streets  I'm the home of  drag and roll  it would have been  better if you played  Hart  or Joan Jett  in The Runaways  because they're lesbians  yep  I remember 
[01:19:00]  you ever bootlight  concerts  I remember  Jerry Martier  saying something like  what did he say  he was like  and now  the  the most obscene  song title ever  come on Eileen  yeah  I do remember that  that was  that was the moment  I wanted to be  a DJ  no it wasn't  you're a cuddly  it certainly wasn't  what a cuddle bunny  but you guys never  wanted to bootlight  concerts or any of  that shit  I bought them on time 
[01:19:30]  dude I would find  an Aussie connection  and you get a  printed out shit  that's what I'm  talking about  Buzzy would have  a whole Aussie  connection  and you know what  he probably still  has that shit  if you really  want to look  into it  it's all online  now  honestly  but I bought  dude I would  order  oh my god  you got fucking  Aussie from  Cobo Hall  in 84  like yeah  well guys like  Buzzy were the  ones helping you  guys out  by bootlegging  him  yeah  he was very  obsessed too  when a big show 
[01:20:00]  came to Rochester  he got the seating  chart of the  fucking arena  because he always  wanted to get the  seat in the middle  of a row  in the middle  of a section  so like the  security would  have a tougher  time finding him  and then the  people around you  would get so  I remember we  were at a rush  show bootlegging  a rush show  and people around us  got so fucking  excited like  holy shit  your bootlegging  alright man  we'll help you out  oh really  did they want  a copy  send me a copy  I don't know  maybe exchange  a couple phone 
[01:20:30]  numbers here and  there  but everyone  got so excited  when that shit  went down  I'd have told  because that's  dishonest  absolutely  right over there  in security  I'd have run  to security  and told on you  but the point  the point is simple  now you go to a show  and it's like  it doesn't matter  at all  everyone just puts  their iPhones up  and gets a shitty  version of  their giant iPads  but there was a day  man they looked  out for that shit  the Grateful Dead  was the first ones  more or less  that just said  fuck it  let's allow this  and then a lot 
[01:21:00]  of bands  just followed suit  you know  with the years  to come  it was very smart  by them  because they're  a big touring band  and it just made  an event  they had a whole  section  you ever go to  a Grateful Dead  show  they would have  a whole section  with these people  setting up their shit  to bootleg the shows  giant fucking mics  way up in the air  mic  to get the  you know  get the sound  without getting  all the people  talking near the  microphones  they had it  figured out  it was an amazing  scene  and they just  they never  that should do 
[01:21:30]  what you want  we don't care  that's great  I like that  that's fan friendly  though  Grateful Dead  wow  yeah they were  the first  absolutely  oh yes  I have the  Randy Rhodes  video that  Marty  Duds  shot  what is that  that's something  Jimmy would want  Buzzy  I have the  Randy Rhodes  video that  Marty Duds  shot  Marty Duds  oh boy  he was the  one that had  some of that  some of that  I showed you  the tape  oh yeah  the band 
[01:22:00]  stuff  no  no  oh no  the disgusting  the dead guy  dead guy  right  right  by the way  that was pretty  tall  did I ever show  you that video  what  there's a video  of a girl  this goes way  back  I'm even scared  to talk about  30 years ago  there's a video  of a girl  she's taking  this guy's  huge hog  and she starts  she starts  twisting the  balls around  like a doorknob  like a doorknob  so she twists  like I don't know  a quarter of the way 
[01:22:30]  then half the way  then all the way  around  and then a little  further  and it's like  it gets to the point  you're thinking  there's no fucking  way anyone could  handle this  and then I believe  I haven't seen this  in a long time  but I believe  she tries to lift  them up  by the twisted  ball bag  and then  the camera pans out  to show  what looks like  to me  a fucking  dead guy  he was a dead guy  he was a fucking  dead guy  on a couch  and it looked like  they did it  in like a funeral  home  like they just  went in one night  like get a dead guy 
[01:23:00]  they fucking made  some kind of a weird  dead guy porno  and uh  yeah  that was before  the internet  people  there's no way  you could find that  online I don't think  word of mouth  this guy Marty  had all sorts  of weird shit  like that  isn't it weird  how the word of mouth  like when you would  order from someone  like Buzzy  what I would do  is I would get  this list  this ditto sheet  print it out  you couldn't believe  I would get audio  a lot of times  not to do this  I would walk around  with it  and uh  you'd call the guy  or write 
[01:23:30]  and you'd send  a cash or check  and he would mail you  I still have a box  of fucking videotape  Ozzy concerts  that a fan sent me  in like 2001  2002  on uh  fucking VHS  yeah  but I have them  all on digital too  Buzzy should just  call a show  because now he just  wrote sick shit  rocked  yeah the tape  was called  there was a VHS tape  that went around  it was called  sick shit  and that was where  we saw the Bud Dwyer  for the first time  our Bud  now everyone has seen  our Bud Dwyer  but this fucking  tape  it was called 
[01:24:00]  sick shit  it was a lot of  news footage  of you know  stuff that they  filmed  but obviously  especially back then  they could never  show on TV  there was no internet  so it just kind of  sat there  and uh  people started  putting together  these uh  compilation VHS tapes  and one was called  sick shit  that was the one  I showed years  and years ago  and that's when  the our Bud Dwyer  video first popped  it's amazing how mild  that is now  compared to what  you can just click  like it's weird  I don't watch that shit  right  I don't watch that shit  but I mean  the world  it's just amazing  how you can get 
[01:24:30]  any of that stuff  the second you want it now  you remember  Faces of Death  I was just thinking  of it as you were talking  I was thinking of it  where it turned out  a lot of that stuff  was kind of  most of it  90% of it was  was set up  some of the news footage  was real  but none of that  real film stuff  the alligator thing  was bullshit  like you could see  the cutaways  you're like  oh yeah  I didn't look for this  when I was a kid  the editing  the bear  there was no bear  and the monkey brains  but Faces of Death  that was huge  yeah  Francis B. Gross  remember the doctor  Francis B. Gross  yeah  Francis B. Gross 
[01:25:00]  yeah  he had a great voice  that guy though  whoever he was  he's dead now  I forget his real name  yeah he had a  he definitely had a good voice  man  so  Buzzy has this thing  it's a Randy Rhoads thing  it's rare  channel 31 show  I'd love to see that  yeah  he'll send it in to us  Randy Rhoads footage  is very rare  well done  Randy Rhoads concert footage  oh wait  I think I know  is that from the  like the Palladium  in After Hours  the show is called  if it's from a show  called After Hours  I have it  with Ozzy and Randy  and it was Rudy Sarzo 
[01:25:30]  and Tommy Aldrich  and they did a fucking  great set up there  in like Syracuse  or Rochester  Pied Pepper Records  ads in Rolling Stone  the best bootleg source  in the 70s  damn  alright  getting some info  on bootlegs  it's been a while  no one does bootlegs  anymore really  no not at all  it's all about movies  now you bootleg the movie  and that's getting  easier and easier  huh  get a screener  and you get  fucking shit  all over the person  that it was given to 
[01:26:00]  just put it out there  has anyone ever  gotten in trouble  what happened  like for taking a screener  right  and putting it online  yeah absolutely  you know how your name  is on it and everything  absolutely yes  yeah  yes  because there's a way  they decode it  and sometimes they'll  put your name  halfway through the movie  so the guys don't know  their name is on it  yeah  Stern had one come out  recently  somebody from his show  I think put it up  right  yeah I saw that one  and it wasn't that  they didn't get in trouble  but there was a guy  from a radio show  in Seattle  that actually got like  fired and got like  six months in jail 
[01:26:30]  because he had  Jesus  I made that up  oh  I just wanted to show  it was a good idea  and say wow  someone's in jail  anything better  it's crazy  I love when we get  the whole thing up  I love when we get  screeners though  and it says  you know  for Opie and Anthony  then I feel like  I'm in the credits  I'm in the credits  I had something  to do with this  but then it's just  Opie and Anthony  through the whole  fucking movie  like alright  yeah  I get it  don't do anything  with this copy  can I see the movie now  because my name is  blocking the face 
[01:27:00]  of the fucking lead  what  oh  well we got a break  so we could talk  about Valentine's Day  a little bit  by the way  the blueberries  are stellar today  really  yeah  they're amazing  are you setting me up  no  because you know  I want blueberries  I know they're good  they're ice cold  they're very tasty  ice cold  I've been swim walking  internally  I don't like ice cold  blueberries  because he washed  them with cold water  I like that  oh  I like my blueberries 
[01:27:30]  washed  alright  so yes  After Hours  shot at Channel 31  in Rochester  Marty Duda  that's right  I said  he wrote Duds  at first  but yeah  this guy  Marty Duda  he had a lot  of shit  directed  he did all  the Weez TV shows  with me at Channel 8  okay  so he's got some  very rare  Randy Rhodes  video from Rochester  I think I have that  you really think  you have that one  After Hours  I do have it  oh  they sang I Don't Know  he did Mr. Crowley  Crazy  I've seen it  it's great  so you got it  oh yeah 
[01:28:00]  I believe that's the one  just hoping I could  turn you on to something  you don't have yet  I was hoping  you even have that one  yeah yeah  someone out there  has got really rare  Randy footage  it's really  there was a concert  that resurfaced  when Ozzy's box set  came out recently  it's from like 81  maybe up in that area  and it's not even  that good of footage  it's like  it's not perfectly centered  the audio is decent  but it's Randy Rhodes live  that's such rare shit  man  it's really  really hard to find  so anyone that's got  a video of that

[01:36:00]  i hate the blues  why  oh i don't know  they make you feel  bad  they mix it up  they use a lot  of different riffs  nice  that's every  fucking  shitty blues song  that's how  every  blues song  hates the blues  come on 
[01:36:30]  it's ironic  because you  give them  to everybody  you've touched  what about  soul kitchen  no  nothing  you don't like  soul kitchen  listen to this  come on  it's not bad  what about  writers on the  storm  people are  strange is  great  yeah  come on  baby  like my  fire  oh my god  no i hate  it  that's how  they said  it  fire  come on  baby

[01:39:00]  association  the association  the story is great  they met on the beach  i  i have nothing  as far as  it's one of the great american bands  you're talking about here  oh no  yes  listen to that  every one of these songs  why don't you like this  i can't switch the radio off  fast enough  when these  on the road  overplayed  fucking  crap songs 
[01:39:30]  listen to the blues influence  oh  oh no  i'm just doing this to annoy you  you know that  it's working  really  oh this is okay  this is a good song  how many times are you going to listen to this  not many more  how many fucking times  can anyone listen to this song  have you heard enough  unbelievably enough

[01:45:30]  they didn't need everything in two minutes  oh  i don't  kinda let it  settle in a little bit  i like that good hit  this is nice  you know  it's a little long in this part  holy shit  this just goes on and on  doesn't it  well can i uh  go to this call  brian in chicago  brian  hey you guys  how you doing  first time caller  no one gives a shit  yeah  i know 
[01:46:00]  i just wanted to let the aunt know  he loves the blue oyster cult  alright  yeah how can  how do you like blue oyster cult  over the doors  blue oyster cult  and the doors  defend that  there's nothing  nothing  i mean if you measure  you measure them up  side by side  all their hits  their albums  the doors  they top  they just top it  i mean they got  what four classics  right off the bat  their first album  l.a woman's  uh  classic album  strange days  is a classic album  not just a one hit wonder album 
[01:46:30]  you know like  why don't you  shut the fuck up  it's over the doors  i mean i understand that  you're your answer  and you gotta  you gotta tell me to shut up  if i don't  no i really mean it  yeah  we've been critical mass  that's what we were waiting for  you never went and saw like  i love you anyway though man  you're the man  you never saw the doors cover bands  on longer island when you were  growing up in the 80s  oh what l.a woman  i think there was crystal ship  was a big one 
[01:47:00]  that bull hulse  see we've done this bit  he's the fat  he was the fat fucking uh  there was one  morrison  was he the band where the show  started with them  carrying him to the stage  on a door  yeah on a door  okay even the  trivia band stunk  you remember that right  yeah  that was awesome  and then they would  plop him on the stage  he'd be a drunk mess  but then he would sound  pretty good  they'd bring a ladder  on stage  so when he's singing  mr mojo rising  he'd climb the ladder  yeah  i don't remember that 
[01:47:30]  because he'd be rising  it's terrible  of course it is  mojo rising  it's jim morrison  all fucking  scrambled up and shit  yeah man  there was some kind of  meaning behind that  this is good  this is awful  it's so fun to see  the dumb little  and i mean little things  that just annoy you  how many albums 
[01:48:00]  did they put out the doors  i think it was 18  oh i thought it was  more like 45  oh  i don't know in the end  because then what happened  was they just started  fucking putting out  anything they could find  yeah  yeah they really started  fucking with the legacy  of the whole band  what about the  how many studio albums  though  maybe five or six  i would guess  yeah  huh  looks like seven  no because 78  he was already gone  died in the 71  sam  well that was the  an american prayer 
[01:48:30]  crap  they found a  shit  poetry  and they put  stupid  bud  and you ever hear  his poetry  put to music  oh that's nice  let's hear that  that's when they  lost to me  i'll be honest with you  i like that  they found a book  of his poems  and decided  he's dead  they're like  well we can still  make money off this  shit  who wrote  who said it  so the band got  together and they  fucking put music  to it  wait it was  jim radiant though  right  oh yeah  oh right  okay  oh yeah  because i guess  he went in studio  one day  and he just taped  oh yeah you're right  some of his poetry  and then the band 
[01:49:00]  he didn't  i don't know if he  wanted it out there  i have no idea  but then the band  decided after his death  let's put music  to this  i gotta write poetry  for my radio show  please quit  play misty for me  yeah  what uh  you got one of those  this will end this  uh horrendous segment  i don't have the poetry  no  no it's gotta be in there  i bet it's on uh  the internets  an american prayer  anything  look for jim morrison's  uh poetry  oh  online 
[01:49:30]  you got it  ugh  this is gonna be  do you know the  warm progress  yeah yeah yeah  hold on hold on  start this over  i'm already annoyed  this is really gonna  bother oh no  but i can't defend this  this is really  douche chilly  you ready for this  oh i am ready  all right  do you know the  warm progress  under the stars  do you know we exist  have you forgotten  the keys to the kingdom  have you been born yet  and are you alive  holy fuck 
[01:50:00]  reinvent the gods  all the myths  of the ages  celebrate symbols  from deep elder forests  we've forgotten the  lessons of the  ancient war  we need great  golden copulations  fathers are cackling  in trees of the forest  our mother is dead  in the sea  you know we are being  led to slaughters  by placid admirals  and that fat slow 
[01:50:30]  generals are getting  obscene on young blood  yeah man  you know we are ruled  by tv  no  nothing  guerrilla bands  terrible  it's almost like to a  disco beat  i'm pretty certain  morrison would have  been really pissed off  that they put music  to his shit  i don't mind this  it's whatever 
[01:51:00]  it was self-serving  for the rest of the  guys  this was the doors  though  put the music to it  oh yeah  oh yeah  we live we die  and death not  ends it  our bass player wrote  this  done  jazz odyssey  you're done  that's fine  let's do some  mike francesa  everyone  yes  ah  so big snowstorm 
[01:51:30]  hit the east coast  we all know that by now  mike francesa  before the storm hit  was kind of downplaying  how bad it was going to be  who would do that  and uh  yesterday  first day back on the radio  after the big snowstorm  once again  his fucking listeners  and i'll say it again  we love you guys  for doing this  it just  it just brings us such joy  over here at the opian anthony show  i would love to hear him chip bombed  i would love to hear somebody do chip to him  sure  i would love to hear 
[01:52:00]  we share a little audience  a little bit i would say  enough to maybe get that done for you jimmy  and um  so  so they were asking uh francesa  well they were basically saying he was wrong  and of course mike francesa would not let it go  still got a little ways to go  and uh  this week you do have pitchers catches  we'll start to slide into baseball a little bit  we got some other things to do on a busy monday  one thing i want to get to  and  like i  usually i don't get into this stuff  but  two weeks ago  there was this ridiculous story about me  having a police escort to the airport 
[01:52:30]  which i had to open on monday's show  with which was totally a lie  and then this story that i happened on yesterday  and in a different part of the daily news about uh the  whatever that two section thing is they run on sunday  where they usually put half naked girls in there to try and get you to look at it  that i  he just gets annoyed by everything  i love him  you kind of love him  i fucking love mike francesa  why are you annoyed by half naked girls in the paper  i love it  that this guy gets annoyed like this  he's a man after my own heart 
[01:53:00]  this is great  girls in there to try and get you to look at it  that i  on thursday  because friday i was up in mohegan sun  and what was a terrible storm up there  my god we had  so much snow it was ridiculous  and unfortunately the  charity event got cancelled  and rightly so  because up there  they got a tremendous amount of snow  but  the point was  and this is my only premise  that i even bring it up  the point was that  uh  they started a  headline saying that  i had predicted that 
[01:53:30]  there would be no snowstorm  and there was this huge nor'easter  i didn't predict anything  i never made any  any prediction about  any snowstorm  okay  well we opened up the show  talking about on thursday was  we were talking about  how  weathermen  and the art of forecasting on television  shoot for the worst  give you the worst possible scenario  and then  they've told you the worst  and you hope for the best  that was the point of it  sometimes  you get a lot of snow  and sometimes you don't get a lot of snow 
[01:54:00]  who knows  my point was  who knows  not that i knew  i never told you  how much snow was coming  i never once  predicted how much snow was coming  so this idea  that i made this  huge prediction  about how  there was not going to be  a big snowstorm  is a total lie  it's a total fabrication  i never made  any prediction  i was talking about  the great  unknown  of these storms  and as this storm  would show you  there was great unknown  in this storm  because right after that  i got a phone call  from a guy  i said  what are you talking about  you're lost 
[01:54:30]  there's going to be  this massive blizzard  in new york  he's going on  that's why it's great  he just can't let it go  he's just a bore  which we know  we did not get in new york  but we did get  up in boston  and up in northern  connecticut  where they got  you know  30 inches of snow  but  my point was  i never said  one word  about predicting  snowstorms  i never said  one thing  about  i knew  i wouldn't know  an isobar  from an icicle  so i never said  one thing about  how much snow  was coming  what i gave you  right after i got off 
[01:55:00]  that phone call  120  was the u.s.  weather forecast  up to the minute  which at that time  which i read four times  during the show on Thursday  four times  i read the  u.s. weather bulletin  when it came over  i read it at  120  i'm back to check  read it at 120  it was 4 to 8  i read it at  2  he's telling what time  he read the weather  i read it at  3 o'clock  and it was 6 to 10  and then i gave you  one at 5 o'clock  which they were  predicting a blizzard  for new york  new york city 
[01:55:30]  and areas  of 11 to 14  with maybe much more  now as it turned out  as you know  depending where you were  you got a great  difference amount of snow  like in new york  we got  where i live  we got 11 inches  oh my god  let's do it  going on  jersey got  depends where you live  from a little to a lot  and then amazingly  on a little section  of smithtown area  if you're out there  you know  there was like  this band that came  through that dumped  like 2 and a half feet  for like a little path  of suffolk county  not a lot at the end  not a lot in nassau 
[01:56:00]  comparatively  we had 10 11 inches  but they had like  3 feet or 2 and a half feet  in this little band  that went through  smithtown and that area  which closed the liu  from like the 50s  to the high 60s  so it really depended  where you were  but here's the only point  i'll make  i read the  u.s weather forecast  four times on the show  i never made a prediction  are you begging for the doors  to come back  yeah right  apologize when they want  because i never  ever made  and you know what happened  he just doesn't repeat himself  so they create a storm  a story to put on the top  of the page  to put a story about me  making predictions  about the weather 
[01:56:30]  which i never did  if i did i'd say it  i never made one prediction  ever  and it wasn't even close  so you got lost  in the story  so it was just  absolute total fabrication  so not one word of it  was true  but i'm not wasting  any more time on that  now  but he's not wasting  any more time on that  after you've wasted  a lot of time on that  he's very easy to get to  yeah  he is  you know  thank god  you could go back  and hear what he actually  said on the show 
[01:57:00]  ah  would you  would you like to hear that  the magic of  recording  yes  i want to hear it  so we could hear  exactly what he said  about the storm  i read the weather  at uh  let's see  it was 9 10 p.m  uh a.m  i was  no no  i read it again  at  here's what time  you read the weather  here's the audio  in question  joe in inglewood  what's up joe  hey how you doing  mike  way to start up the show  yes  ah mike  i just  i don't know  if you've been sleeping  all day  but maybe you should  get a weatherman on 
[01:57:30]  because you  by the way  i do love when they  bring up the sleep thing  oh yeah  i don't know  because they  they do that a lot  they go  i don't know  if you've been sleeping  all day  but you hear  in the news  i don't know  if you've been sleeping  and had he just  laughed it off  the first time  they wouldn't even  think he'd say it  to this day  he refuses to admit  he fell asleep  on the air  even though the video  was so obvious  that he did  yes  uh mike  i just  i don't know  if you've been  sleeping all day  but maybe you  should get a weatherman  on because you  are lost  with the weather  we're getting  for tomorrow  oh wait 
[01:58:00]  now you're a weatherman  right okay  no  so wait a second  what do we  wait  wait  wait  get john elliot on  and he's a real  weatherman  don't pretend like  you know weather  okay so  now let's talk about  here's another guy  joe in england  so joe  what's the weather  forecast for tomorrow  six to twelve inches  in the city  six to twelve inches  no that's not  the weather forecast  and you live in  long island mike  maybe you should be  worried about your  house out there  because you're  getting a blizzard  out there  we are huh  not by the 
[01:58:30]  wait a second  wait a second  like i said  mike  another guy  how much time did  you know  talking about the  weather  so he's lying  this is exactly  his broadcast  he's fucking  absolutely dumb  this is great  he's fucking lying  he's losing his mind  he's defending this  audio that he  never said any  of this shit  wait a second  wait a second  like i said  mike  another guy  you know  talking about  the weather  like you usually  talk about stuff  you have no clue  about  joe joe 
[01:59:00]  john elliott  get him on mike  joe  if you want to  watch john elliott  go watch him  if you want to  watch john elliott  go watch him  okay  i just got off  the weather thing  two seconds ago  three to six inches  on long island  starting as rain  friday night  people  run to the store  get scared  think you're gonna  get two feet of snow  three feet of snow  oh god snow  whenever there's a snow  snow everyone thinks  they're getting  20 inches of snow  you know why  because they don't  want to work  they want to stay  home and sit home  you know  and worry about the weather  but that's exactly  what happened 
[01:59:30]  so why is he  defending this  this is exactly  what he said  what's wrong with him  he's a douche  they don't want to work  they want to stay home  and sit home  you know  and worry about the weather  okay  adam and hicksville  go ahead adam  what's on your mind  let me for that  second caller  give you the  now this is the  latest weather forecast  okay  this is the official  weather forecast  for the metropolitan area  this is for  all right  and long island  this is now 
[02:00:00]  friday's weather forecast  okay  okay  the weather on friday  will begin  as rain  okay  as rain  he does that  and then  it will turn  to snow  it will turn  to snow  actually  around saturday  morning  as the weather  gets a little  chillier  we will start  to see  the snow  develop  okay  the snow  will  it will begin  as rain  and then  become snow  the precipitation

[02:01:30]  what i'm fucking  obsessed with being  right asshole  crazy  okay  yeah  at 107  this is the part  where he's just  reading the weather  you're worried about  like  but the part before  that was all his  opinion about it  by the way  he's terrible  is this a sports  show we're listening  to  yeah  okay  just  i just don't  want to fill up  a lot of time  especially now  because football's  over  baseball's sort  of starting  their spring  training  he just repeats  him like he's  obsessed with  being right 
[02:02:00]  what a bore  up to 24 to 30  inches of snow  i'm gonna go  get the papers  get the papers  ours is gonna  start as rain  he just said this  snow until late  friday night into  saturday morning  we know  with precipitation  with with accumulation  here it says four to  eight inches  oh my fucking god  you know if you  want more snow  you know  maybe you'll get  some but that's  the forecast right  now  he's pulling a  chat  there's uh  we get the chat  but that's great  it's a big article  on that whole thing 
[02:02:30]  in the paper today  in new york  on what  about him just  refusing to admit  that he was  wrong  he's just a jerk  off  a jerk  off  what paper is  the article  i'm not sure  chat  well if you  let me  my barometric  pressure  oh there it is  francesa snow  job good  snow job  he needed  the money  uh the forecast  might call for an  apology but mike  francesa instead 
[02:03:00]  goes back on attack  choosing to deny  saying what he  said  it's a huge  article in the  sports section  today  that's  he's gonna go  nuts over this  today  he will  because he's  not gonna be  able to accept  this  no  are you reading  it jimmy  is there  anything in  there  no  it's just  uh  it's just  denies prediction  amid blizzard  of backlash  right  i don't know  anybody cares  what this  fucking fat  dullard said  but uh  he's opening 
[02:03:30]  his show  by bashing  his story  yeah they're  just they're  kind of going  over what we  just did  yeah but  there you go  so today should  be really good  because he's not  going to accept  that the paper's  taking little  shots at him  yeah  i didn't say  it  i didn't say  it dog  okay okay  okay okay  okay okay  he's terrible  with that man  dog  yeah 
[02:04:00]  um  i think he's  doing pretty  well  he might be  doing well  but i'm saying  i think his rating's  doing okay  but he's i'm  saying he's  terrible to  listen he's  boring  i kind of  very well  i kind of  like listening  to him  these clips  especially  my god  speaking of  radio  radio  what do you  got there  you rock  i'm on a  mexican  radio  i'm on a  mexican  radio  well he said  to keep tabs  on uh 
[02:04:30]  scott and top  in case he did  anything topical  so he did a  song about the  pope  really  yeah  a pope  um  song parody  texas radio  and the big  beat  no  damn it  nothing  no  so scott and  todd uh  they do a  terrific morning  show here in  new york city  oh  i wish we were  as good as  those fucking  guys man  they're doing 
[02:05:00]  it  and they got  uh a pope  song parody  wanna hear it  please  i guess the pope  it's big news  him stepping down  first guy in  600 years  yeah  first guy in  600 years  there's the  latest on that  do we know  anything more  today  yes  holding him a  new studio  here  he's getting  a show  he probably  will get a  show here  that's why  he left  the pope  he's got a  pacemaker we  learned i think  that's good  he's had a  pacemaker for a  while  that's good 
[02:05:30]  has he been  seen in public  in a while  i figured god  would have  fixed that for  him but  you know he  works in those  mysterious ways  oh nice  you too  you too  fan right  mysterious ways  uh you know  what i like  you too  better than the  doors  love the  you too  i like you  too's a  hit songs  i don't go  too deep  with you  too  but i like  their hits  so you don't  do red hill  mining town  i can't  stand you  why  it just means  us opie  oops 
[02:06:00]  um  yeah i just  don't like them  i wish i did  believe me  i wish to god  i liked them  i just  they don't get  they don't reach  me  what bothers  you  i acknowledge  they're a good  band  and that they're  you know  edge is a good  guitarist  and bottle  has a great  voice  they just  don't reach  me  sometimes it  just happens  where  it's like  you're watching  something through  glass and you're  not feeling any  of it  could you find  and sam now you  can be back in on  the conversation  because jack white  was part of that  documentary  huh 
[02:06:30]  it might get  loud  it might get  loud is a  great rock  documentary  and the edge  makes fun of  himself  rockumentary  rockumentary  if you will  he talks about  how intricate  his guitar work  is but then  he shows all  he did was  turn on this  little fucking  thing  oh right  yeah  it's a great  scene for that  movie  if that's online  is he rich  huh  is the edge  rich  oh my god  if you got that  scene really fast  and then we'll go  on to the scott  and todd thing  he breaks it down  i don't know why  he would do this  let me see the edge  sam i'm over there 
[02:07:00]  watching the gene show  i can't see it  i don't know if this is  probably it  i hate just 
[02:07:30]  watching guitarist  noodle  gotta watch my brother  noodling his guitar  all fucking  my whole life  you know annoying  like real good  guitarist are  by the way  they'll sit there  and i'm like  yeah as a kid  here's my whole  fucking childhood  growing up  with my brother  joe  joe  joe  joe  joe  joe  and he's just  man noodling  noodling away  on his guitar  he's a good guitarist  oh fuck yeah  what does noodling mean  just trying to  just 
[02:08:00]  just trying to  find some shit  that you wanna play  just like  running running  running uh  you know  riffs up and down  the neck  just fucking  has he met the edge  um i don't think so  you think he'd like to  probably would  yeah  anthony's brother  is an amazing guitarist  yeah he's really good  yeah  terrible person  oh yeah  good kisser  but i think it sounds good  this might be it  finally  probably not  nah 
[02:08:30]  it's cool  now where's pride  somewhere  there's big foot pedal  rig man  that's all  there we go  this might be the same  they don't even like  cry  are you two  it's okay  yeah it doesn't stink 
[02:09:00]  it's okay  they're very very famous riffs  but he explains it here  somewhere in this video  i feel like we're committed  now  yeah  i didn't even know  this would let  i didn't even get  a little different  now  shit  would the fans be cheering  if they heard this  oh my god  people would lose their shit 
[02:09:30]  are they popular in ireland  not really  well sam if you can find that clip  i think it's worth playing  because he just shows you how simple this shit really was  pretty amazed that he pointed that out  but  all right we got scott and todd  now you're talking music  yes  this is talent  of course  how many uh  fucking shoehorned in lines 
[02:10:00]  does todd do in this song  this might be right here though  oh  oh shit  demonstrating his guitar  demonstrating  his guitar rig  sam what are you doing  you're breaking it  sam  comment  i mean you can listen to it  i'm previewing it  my review  hard shirt  the bounces were particularly heavy  in the venue  this is so spinal tap right here  yeah  there's some kids down the front  getting pummeled  this guitar  so i actually threw the guitar off  this is stein  intervened  this has been tested for awesomeness 
[02:10:30]  if i was playing it  and uh bonner stopped the show  and we  you go out and have a bike  and come back  you're still hearing that one  and the head was  totally broken  look at this one  still got the old tagger on it  don't touch it  he always wears a fucking hat  it's a very good question  i don't know  i don't know  there he goes right there  oh  it's playing  we're making  the record  he was but sam ruined it  we made the record  we're really taking our  sound in a different direction 
[02:11:00]  and  direction  he actually looks really young  beautiful day  yeah  this part came to mind  and i played it  and it  just didn't sound good on  uh  the uh  the guitars  that's got a million views almost  him just yapping about this song  just  blabbering on  the part  and when everyone else came back  they were like  shut up edge  we heard you  you can't do that  you know that's like  that's from a few years ago  that's not like  where we're going 
[02:11:30]  and i  i said well  really  we have to be able to  go back  if it's  if it's  holy shit  shut up edge  alright  you potato eating motherfuckers  on this record  and that was  look at this house  on the water there  what about the  coming back to the guitar  the basic  personality  of the  guitarist  do you think  personality  you know there is a  lead singer personality  and there's a lead  god damn it  if you can find it  that's a nice fucking  house on the water  good job sam  automatic shades  in the background 
[02:12:00]  you probably push the button  the shades go  edge would like  darkness  this show is so  off the rails  is this it sam  yeah  i don't know  oh it is sam  this is it right  here you go  and then what 
[02:12:30]  that is an example  of a song  that really came out  of the guitar part  i mean we had a great  idea for  an approach  jimmy this isn't it  either  then what happened  jimmy lied  got it  this isn't it  jimmy  of course  do that for us  all the time  then what  do you pick up  sounds these sounds  that you get  sometimes  oh here it comes  this is it jimmy  are there sounds  that come in your head  first or do you  find them and then 
[02:13:00]  they then you elaborate  is this annoying  your answer  no i love  i'm so frustrated  that i love it  sometimes it's experimentation  where you're just  working on something  and you figure out  what it what it can do  what it yeah  oh this might be it  most um  yeah this is it  most effects units  will be able to do  something very well  here it is  designed  to do hundreds of things  often i find it's like  one really great thing  yeah  so it's unearthing that  is is is part of the  challenge 
[02:13:30]  sometimes then you you  you kind of know  sound that you've heard  before  will you stop  meandering  is he fiddling about  he is  discovering something  oh just fussing around  there  these  oh  you might  there are what about  sort of a dozen or so  guitars but you might  have as many  more over there  how many more  that's not it  this one's called  lick my love pump  you lied jimmy  oh here we go 
[02:14:00]  here we go  oh this is it  this is it  can you really  make a sound  without having to  keep plucking the  strings because the  sustain would continue  sustain  to that original one  this is it  this is that production  guitar  ow  ow  pause this for a second  let's hear it 
[02:14:30]  scott and todd  i want to hear scott and todd  it's right up to the  point  well if you find it sam  don't give up on this  please  we need a conclusion to  the edge mystery  don't we  yes we do  okay good  could you rub my leg  right there my abductors  no  what's an abductor  um  conductor  sitting next to one  it's a part of you  oh  hold on guys  oh yeah  uh jim  yes 
[02:15:00]  what do you need  hey man what's up  how are you  so the song i'm looking for  is that he's playing  elevation from that  documentary it might get  loud  uh-huh  elevation  you can find the part  where he plays elevation  sam  elevation  you know what part of  the uh part two video  it's in  yeah  i have no idea  you know how elevation  goes sam because if you  hear that then we're  on to something  i got this  oh  apparently you don't 
[02:15:30]  because i i can't  preview anything  because you just  turn it on  well because you keep  giving us the nod  like you found it  i've never given you  a nod  jimmy is sam  nodding at us today  yeah he's thumbs up  with his big dumb  long opposable thumb  thumbs when he ever  holds something in  pictures that he  instagrams i'm like  ugh  he could be holding  the holy grail  and i'm just looking  going ew that thumb  he can actually scratch  the back of his own  hand with his thumb  yes  fucking creepy  sam i think  it's an impressive thumb  thank you  all right  oh stunt brain 
[02:16:00]  wants to um  feature some of my  new uh drone  video uh on the  blaze  can i email a few  short questions  drones are all in  the news right now  cool  there are certain  states legislating  uh against the  drone  i would say uh  stay under the  radar man you  don't want that  shit out  i don't care  yeah  what am i  what are they  gonna do  what are they  gonna do  come over  you gotta  have a drone  where is it  is that it 
[02:16:30]  ah here it is  there it is  here it is  that's elevation  without effects  this is what i'm  actually playing  why would he admit  that  that's it  the rest is  the foot pedal  the effects  the whole thing  you know so  if you're on  acoustics  here's my  new riff  it's really cool  riff  listen  let me hear the 
[02:17:00]  beginning of this  though because i  want to hear what  it sounds like  when he first  played it  we probably should  start  yeah  he's using the  volume pedal  right  keep it playing  keep it playing  this is what i'm  actually playing  wow wow wow  wow wow  but how do you  figure that shit  out  that's pretty cool  that's it the rest  is the foot pedal  of the effects the  whole thing  no so if you're  on acoustics 
[02:17:30]  here's my new  riff  really cool riff  listen  imagine bringing  this really cool  riff to your band  well we should  play that 10 minutes  ago but  yeah what happened  sam was futzing  around  why were you  futzing around  exactly finding  wwe videos  he was futzing  hey look this is  where the iron sheath  throws the chair  off the rail  oh god right  off the rail  whatever it is  whatever the fuck  hey it's bob backland  again  eric to you buddy  so we got the  scott and todd 
[02:18:00]  we did the song  parodies  scott and todd  they did the tie-in  with the pope thing  and uh is it a good  song parody  oh yes it's one of  his best  yeah are they  shoehorning  what would a scott  and todd parody  be without shoehorning  exactly  wouldn't it be good  if they did a song  parody about  his shoehorn  that would be  great  and then their  shoehorn lyrics  that would be  terrific  fucking uh  like the  nexus city universe  um what song  are they uh  doing it to  um it is what  you would call  um traditional  or royalty free 
[02:18:30]  music  royalty free music  what does that  mean  it means it's  music that wasn't  that sounds like  royalty free  it wasn't sung by  leonard lawrence  lawrence one of  arabia  what's your name  fat body  prime's name's  eric nagel sir  never gets old  wait so it's an  original song parody  technically i think  it's an original song  you know the song  it's what they call  traditional so you  don't have to pay  rights to use it  oh what does that  mean it's open to  the public domain  is that like a happy  birthday  no happy birthday's 
[02:19:00]  copyrighted  by who  give me some old  ladies  copyright for it  no is she really  yeah do you need  her copyright to  use it  no fucking way  he doesn't pay  copyrights on any  of these song  parties  happy birthday  how much  no for happy  birthday  no he's bringing  up something that  is kind of  interesting there are  songs out there  that they're like  the public domain  even though they're  really huge popular  songs  yeah  could you name  one of those  eric  um well uh she'll  be coming around  the mountain  when she comes 
[02:19:30]  that's a popular  song  yeah  well  as far as  traditional music  goes  but everyone knows  the song is the  point here  and and no one  owns that  she'll be coming  around eric when  she comes  it's like shakespeare  stuff  yeah shakespeare  stuff sam roberts  the art of war  the art of war  of course  what  has no copyright  see that's what  we're getting at  here we're trying  to teach the  peoples  you can download  those ebooks  for free  because nobody  owns them  well how about  we try to own  them 
[02:20:00]  they're not up  for a set  I mean nobody  can own them  if no one owns  them someone could  just take it and  say I own it now  yeah but then  another person could  give it away for  free and we  wouldn't have  give it away  give it away  give it away  now  brother joe  oh  brother joe  what's up buddy  he wants to  talk about the  edge  kind of figured  I would  call in  you guys  talk or something  joe of course  is the edge  character  in the  tribute band  to you  I can't stand  that  I can't stand  being referred  to as the 
[02:20:30]  edge  character  you are the  edge  you know how many  of that guy's  riffs were like  almost thrown out  by producers  including like  daniel and  why  really why  they sucked  because they  were  you know what  the most popular  one of those  what was  the beginning of  where the streets  have no name  that thing  that he wrote  for that  it's in one  of the documentaries  that they did  but he said  that he came  into the studio  and they were  like they were  ready to erase  and he had 
[02:21:00]  a cassette  copy of it  and they ended  up putting it  on making  where the streets  have no name  out of it  why  because it  just sucked  so bad  it sucked  it was horrible  Daniel  I'm pretty sure  it was Daniel  Lamoire  that produced  that record  right  so how did  it get to  the point  where it  ruled  did he use  effects  well as soon  as he threw  the delay  on it  and Adam  and Larry  got through  with the  rhythm section  of it  they said  oh holy shit  listen to this  and it became 
[02:21:30]  something  but the riff  itself  the edge  is not  a good  like a  technically  proficient  guitar player  he really  isn't  he's not  he's a  really good  rhythm player  he's got  rhythmically  he's a genius  like a rocket  scientist  but as far  as like  technical  proficiency  goes on a  guitar  he sucks  he sucks  he really  is not  it did seem  like very  easy when he  was doing  the elevation  thing  it was just  like  bram  bram 
[02:22:00]  if it weren't  for delay  and effect  the edge  of guitar  playing  would be  mediocre  at best  and I think  the where the  streets have no  name thing  you're talking  about is in  this documentary  I think that's  the one I'm  remembering  yeah Sam  find it  could you  find that  it's in  one of the  documentaries  and he says  you know  this is without  effect  and it's just  like  it's three  notes  four notes  ding ding ding  ding ding ding 
[02:22:30]  ding ding  and as soon as  he puts that  it becomes  this big  it's a triplet  delay  it works  against the  four  hold on  Sam found  it  maybe  it's not  even the  edge  it's probably  Joe  we thought  Sam found  it  let's see  effects  no that's  not it  that's not  it either  oh god  Sam  does everybody  know I'm  going to  Abu Dhabi  with you two  with two you  well we know  now and I think 
[02:23:00]  that's pretty damn  cool  when are you  going to Abu  Dhabi  I'm leaving  tomorrow morning  for how long  we're just  going for three  days  we're back  Saturday  where are you  playing  the Viceroy  the Viceroy  the Viceroy  it's the hotel  that they have  you know the  Grand Prix  they have every  year  United Arab  Emirates  yeah  it goes  underneath  underneath  yeah  does it really  yeah pretty cool  oh it's nuts  this hotel was  built on an  island that 
[02:23:30]  they made  they made  this island  the Isle of  Lucy  are they putting  you up in  the hotel  oh yeah  absolutely  yeah  that is so  cool  and they're  flying you  over there  on Emirates  yeah  that was  in pro  business class  wow  business on  fucking Emirates  show  that's amazing  did you tell  them you were  U2 or something  what the fuck  happened  are they gonna  they've been  courting us for a  while  you know what  happened  every year  I know about  this every year  they have the  10k  the healthy  kidney 10k  it's called 
[02:24:00]  in Central  Park  New York  Roadrunners  do it  and we  played last  year and the  year before  that  year before  that  I was seeing  all these  women walking  around wearing  like half  perkers  I don't know  but there were  flight attendants  from this airway  from this airline  and one of them  must have gotten  back to one of  the emirs  or some shit  I don't know  and we got a  phone call  so we're going  in a couple of  days  how great would  it be that  he's being set  up and they're  gonna kidnap  him and he's  gonna play U2  for the next 10  years  for one guy  fucking one 
[02:24:30]  prince  Joe's whole day  is playing U2  and then being  raped for the rest  for 10 straight  years  how many hours  is that flight  it's 14  and you're only  going for three  days  yeah  that's a long  you're gonna be  tired  that's a pretty  big percentage  of your three  days  business class  at emirs  is gonna be  like first  class  that's true  that's amazing  the only percentage  I worry about  is the dollar  signs in front  of it  why don't you 
[02:25:00]  stay for a  couple more  days  well because  we have other  shows we have  to play  people have to  be back for  their kids  and what not  that's one of  those  it's not like  I'm traveling  alone Jim  but that whole  2U thing  has completely  taken off  man  that's awesome  you know what  else is doing  really well  the journey  thing that's  put back  together  yeah just  slapped together  a journey  band too  pop something  there's YouTube  footage of us  from the  from Maryland  Live Casino  in Baltimore  around Baltimore  and it's

[02:27:00]  yeah the guitar's a little  the guitar's weak  but  fucking  my dad  that sounds really good  he's got his shit together  now Joe  why don't you debut  your latest idea  for a tribute  to a band  that you have  wait you're not  happy with two  now you're going  for a third 
[02:27:30]  well this one's a specialty act  it's just  it's kind of  kind of nuts  I'm hoping  it'll take off  but it's a  you've ever  you must have heard  that  Wizard of Oz  lines up perfectly  with Dark Side of the Moon  yeah of course  well  I ended up  putting together  putting the  the tracks  that I need  for the Pink Floyd  show  because we don't run  with a keyboard player  I track all the keyboards  prior to  and the drummer  plays with a click  so all the keyboards  for all the Pink Floyd  stuff  is basically 
[02:28:00]  on tape  I tape it  ahead of time  and the drummer  plays to a click track  and that click track  is synced up  with the Wizard of Oz  movie perfectly  exactly the way  it was meant  to be seen  and we're doing  the Dark Side of Oz  and it's  it's going to be  you know  with a huge  video screen  or two huge  you know  video screens  on either side  of the stage  and then play that  as they're playing  while it's playing  Jesus  what's a click track 
[02:28:30]  what's a click track  a click track  is uh  is uh  yeah it's basically  the drummer gets it  in his earphones  and it keeps him  in perfect sync  with uh  keeps him in perfect sync  with the uh  with what's going on  in the movie  oh  uh Joe  people suggesting  a Josie and the Pussycats  cover band  is that near future  Josie and the Pussycats  Joe comment  it's been done  you know  it's been done  I'm sure  everything  no matter anything  you could think of  has probably been done  when is the Floyd thing  going to happen 
[02:29:00]  uh  probably uh  sometime in the fall  we're going to need  the summertime  for us  gets crazy  man  we're down  and uh  we're we're  actually we're all  over the place  this summer  both bands  so it's been  uh  it's been  it's been crazy  booking  and uh  it'll happen  in the fall  after it's rehearsed  topsy-turvy world  of rock and roll  that's unbelievable  it's it's  it's made me  a decent living  man  no shit  that's great  all right  Joseph  yep  we're looking  to go over  to uh  to go over 
[02:29:30]  to uh  either  either uh  Iraq or Afghanistan  as well  with um  with USO  so if anyone  from USO  is listening  I'm still uh  I'm still game  for the idea  and what's your  Twitter there Joe  Twitter is  Joseph Kimia  there you go  Joseph Kimia  C-U-M-I-A  they're telling us  you gotta go  yeah  thanks Joe  let me know  how that Emirates  flight is  I'm most excited  to hear about that  no kidding  yeah I'll let you  know  I'll let you know  I know  I know it's got  a bed that stretches  out to 6-1  and uh  that's my exact height

[02:31:00]  actually Sam  probably picked  the worst part  ever  oh Sam  you turd burglar  it's the entire movie  you rump wrangler  you picked the worst part ever  you should have gone back  go back a little part  Sam you turd burglar  go back to like there  the audience can't  go right there  no that part's  not gonna work  we can tell you though  go to the other part  apples  no the other way  oh boy  there you go  yeah this part works  all right let's see  money  this doesn't make much sense

[02:34:00]  mhm  mhm  mhm  mhm  mhm  mhm  mhm  mhm  mhm  mhm  mhm  mhm  mhm  mhm  mhm  mhm  mhm  mhm  mhm  mhm  mhm  mhm  mhm  mhm  mhm  mhm  mhm  mhm  mhm  mhm 
[02:34:30]  mhm  mhm  mhm  But all that will soon go bye-bye.  He'll be just the normal old guy.  That's what happens when you give up being poised.  A little midnight.  The sound.  He'll be relocated to Florida and teach at Community College in Miro Beach.  Community College.  He'll become the king of Pino at his neighborhood casino.  That's in his future when he stops being poised.  His future.  Good.  We'll Benedict get Botox and a facelift.  Botox and a facelift.  Wait, God tell me he will not date Taylor Swift. 
[02:35:00]  Or hang out with Kim and Kanye.  Do a duet with Beyonce.  He couldn't be once too when he's not the Pope.  What's that like little pew, pew, the whistles?  They put the little sound effects in because it's funny.  They fucking stink.  It's retard radio.  It's fucking retard radio.  Put that in the opener for our show, please.  It's fucking retard radio.  Why?  Because we're retarded. 
[02:35:30]  But it really sucks.  Why?  They eat it up.  Woo!  Woo!  Rawp!  Rawp!  Rawp!  That could have set a record for shoehorning.  They eat it up, though, man.  Yeah?  Yeah, their listeners love that shit.  They don't.  They couldn't.  They love it.  I'm telling you.  They couldn't enjoy this type of song.  Ugh.  Because when you mention something, I will mention one thing, and then you mention two things,  I will showhorn.  Rawr, rawr, rawr, rawr.  I could put anything in this song this way. 
[02:36:00]  You don't even have to fucking, it's, there's no talent to just throwing words in.  I know.  That should be the fucking, that should be in our intro, too.  Yeah, my abs are hard.  Sam, you want to feel my abs are hard?  Wait, stop asking me to touch you.  That's your new thing.  Are you fucking inspected for awesomeness?  Why are you wearing that?  I wish you were inspected with a fist for awesomeness.  Don't talk about that, Mr. fucking convict.  Hey, convict.  Yeah. 
[02:36:30]  I'm going to have a Zagnut bar for dinner.  I'm not making excuses and saying it's laundry day.  Here's your goddamn dinner, convict.  I looked at this shirt and said, I'd like to have that, and then I wore it.  Sorry about you, nigger, watermelon.  I was doing my job trying to keep you down in your new jean shirt.  I found it.  I found the edge thing.  Girl, the high heart when I'm here babysitting your ass.  What?  I found it.  We played that already.  We played that.  Yeah, it was good.  All right, I didn't find it yet.  I haven't listened to it to your phone.  What?  Yeah.  Yeah, we'll find it. 
[02:37:00]  We found it.  Minute bomb, minute bomb.  A lot of music today.  Oh, yeah.  Like a music station today.  I want to know why.  Which music station?  I want to know why Sam is so annoyed today.  We're enjoying ourselves.  Because we've had the last two hours talking about Malcolm McDowell.  It's not Malcolm, it's Michael.  I wish it was Malcolm McDowell.  Me too.  He's mad because he looked in the mirror and he comes out of a Marlboro ad.  Because I wasn't inspected for awesomeness?  He's the Marlboro fag.  Your shirt says inspected for awesomeness. 
[02:37:30]  But you have a dark, unwashed jean shirt.  I just washed it yesterday.  It looks unwashed.  It's terrible.  It's not but your dungaree shirt.  No one likes it.  And you're the one wearing unwashed clothes.  You wore that sweater yesterday.  No, I didn't.  I wore that sweater last night.  But Sam.  That was yesterday.  That's the night and today.  It's 12 hours.  Sam, why are you annoyed?  It's obvious that we're having a good time.  That's right.  So break down why you're so annoyed today.  Why you know you're a terrible shirt.  And where did it go wrong?  Go.  All right.  It started to go south.  For you.  Not for us.  And not for the listeners. 
[02:38:00]  Just for you.  Just for me.  Okay.  That's right.  Family tree.  Oh, God.  The Doobie Brothers stuff.  I was like, okay.  That was nice, right?  Michael McDonald.  For me or for the audience?  All right.  Just for you.  For me.  You speak for yourself.  Didn't.  It went a little long.  A little long.  Okay.  And then we followed that up with a half hour on the doors.  Nice.  And then we followed that up with 25 minutes on playing random clips from Edge.  Nice.  Okay.  There's some value there. 
[02:38:30]  Then we played a couple clips of Dark Side of the Moon, apparently synced up with The Wizard  of Oz, but the show doesn't have a visual element, so it meant nothing to the listeners.  We're making the guys down the hall suffer.  Maybe if you would, you know.  That would have made perfect sense if we had a visual element.  And the rest of the day.  What about Joe and the Journey thing?  And what about the Mike Francesa?  And what about the song parody?  The only other time on the radio show you spent criticizing other radio shows for not  being good.  Exactly.  But we were good today.  I did Uncle Paul.  I did say, hey, what do you say?  Give me a nickel. 
[02:39:00]  Right.  We bitched a little bit.  Yeah, you did.  It was bitch about the Mike's.  But only a little bit.  We talked about Valentine's Day and what to get your girls.  That's right.  We did do that.  I described my Artie experience last night.  That's right.  I gave a very good description of that.  Which led to a little bitching.  Right.  But, you know, that's okay.  Right.  Bitch about the Mike's.  Bitch about the studio.  Doobie Brothers.  Doors.  You too.  I like this coming in.  A lot of this coming in on Pal Talk.  Why is Sam important?  Who gives a shit about his opinion?  Opie.  He just asked for it.  Shut Sam up.  Kill Sam. 
[02:39:30]  That's another one.  Sam is the voice of stupidity.  See, Sam, they loved it today.  Yeah, I started speaking for me.  Fuck Sam.  Rape Sam.  Sam.  Only in your dreams.  No one cares about you, Sam.  Yes, Sam.  That's right.  Sam the cunt.  You're full of turkey.  I was asked for my opinion.  So, it's just inserting it.  Burn him and laugh.  By the way, I have to say, these fucking blueberries rule today.  They're amazing.  They could be the best blueberries I've ever eaten. 
[02:40:00]  I would say that.  I'm not even kidding.  The blueberries are a fucking hundred percent home run.  The blueberries are very good today.  They're a massive hit.  You want to try one in?  No, I hate blueberries.  They're all washed and everything.  We could eat watermelon and come back this way.  Can I have some?  This could be a perfect batch, by the way.  Yeah.  Don't fuck with my blueberries.  You just dump a couple in my hand.  Don't play my game.  Just dump in his hand.  I won't mess my cup.  I don't trust you.  I'm going to hold on tight.  Hold on tight to your blueberries. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, I just got shot.  Hold on tight to your blueberries.  Okay.  Doing a song parody.  Let me tell you why these blueberries are amazing, Sam Robertson.  You could add this to the list.  I've never wanted to knock blueberries on the floor.  I know.  And I want you to add this to the list of things we did on today's show.  Yeah?  There's not one bad blueberry in the entire bunch.  That's almost impossible.  It was like this dude went to Blueberry Land and picked them perfectly.  Damn.  Where is Blueberry Land?  That's odd, given the color.  He went to Blueberry Hill.  What's wrong with the color?  Oh, they're dark. 
[02:41:00]  You don't eat fruits because they're too dark?  Yeah, sometimes.  I don't know.  I'm not a big blueberry fan.  Same reason you won't talk to people.  They're not really, for me, a stand-alone fruit.  How do you feel about plums?  I do like a good plum.  They have to be...  Especially if I'm disgusted.  Sam Robertson.  But it has to be perfectly ripe, right?  Yeah.  If it's too ripe, it has that rotting taste to it.  And then if it's not ripe enough, it's horrendous.  Yeah. 
[02:41:30]  Horrendously tart and sour.  You don't like a tart plum?  I don't like a good tart plum.  And Mackinac Peaches.  What's that?  Mackinac Peaches, Jerry!  Which one is that?  I don't know.  They're supposed to be good.  Yeah.  But they have to be just ripe as well.  Yeah.  Yes.  You can't eat them if they're not ripe.  Oh.  We got Craig Robinson coming in today.  Oh, that's right.  What time is Craig here?  Uh, 29.30?  I think he's going to be here.  We're going to interview Craig Robinson.  Today.  Today he comes into our studio. 
[02:42:00]  I got here.  Oh, oh, oh.  He's going to be here at nine.  Who gives a shit?  What?  What?  He's asking when he's coming in.  I just saw him going to Shade.  I just saw him going to the old Shade 45.  Black History Month.  We got a new one.  Month?  Oh, good.  What happened?  Starring DJ Who Kid.  Who has been very good.  And our own Sam Roberts.  Sam has been less than still.  It's characters.  I guess your mom could listen to this part of the show a hundred times today.  Well, I mean, Black History Months have been nothing but complimented. 
[02:42:30]  And the Doors Break was that bad, huh?  For me or for the audience?  For you.  For me?  For you personally.  Not great.  For the audience?  I think the audience probably enjoyed it.  This year, to honor Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show recognizes some of  the great African-American inventors.  Today, we honor Frederick M. Jones, inventor of the air conditioning unit.  Gee golly, it sure is hot in here. 
[02:43:00]  I've had cold water, an ice pop, and sheesh, nothing is cooling me off.  Yo, kid, you hella sweating right now.  You're wet as a motherfucker.  Hey, Mr. Jones, it's super hot today, huh?  You a stupid nigga.  Switch this bitch on.  Whoa, what the H-E double hockey sticks is that?  I put an air conditioner unit in, kid.  I invented that shit.  Now, where's your mom's at?  Upstairs, you goofy Gus. 
[02:43:30]  Ah, much better.  Mom?  The air conditioning unit, another African-American contribution to enrich our lives.  For Black History Month, this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  This, this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony, with Sirius XM.  That's pretty good.  I'm Vinoday, shit.

[02:50:30]  Are you looking for that perfect gift?  Well, look no further.  Introducing the Jim Norton Guide to Jersey City Prostitution.  It's unbelievable.  This four-disc DVD box set, personally narrated by the famous self-deprecating comedian,  will show you some of the most notorious places to pick up women  in one of the most dangerous cities in New Jersey.  If I could, all I would do is rape jokes right now.  In this video, you'll learn how to properly approach a prostitute.  It's easy.  They do recognize you after a while. 
[02:51:00]  They'll heckle you.  Like, they'll yell things.  They keep riding around.  Hookers never like Sabbath.  I learned that.  I would only pick them up if they got it on the right side.  I would stop.  Shit like that.  How to avoid awkward situations when dealing with a hooker.  Every one Puerto Rican chick got in my car and she was eating peanut brittle.  She sucked my dick and it was in a hole that peanut smell.  I was looking at hookers.  And I stopped and the tranny walked over and snatched my glasses off and said,  for wasting my time.  I actually high-beamed and flashed the cop and I'm like, she took my glasses.  I'll never forget it as long as I live.  And most importantly, how to spot a fake.  A lot of times people get fooled, man. 
[02:51:30]  I never realized that a fucking guy would get tits.  It didn't occur to me.  I was getting hookers for a long time at that point.  We were fucking and it's pitch black in my car in Jersey City.  I knew.  Well, when I discovered that the lady was not quite the lady I thought,  it's like, what am I going to do, talk to her manager?  I fucking dumped my load.  So don't be caught off guard and take this advice from someone who's been there time and time again.  I should be fucked in the mouth for The Rock.  It's the Jim Norton Guide to Jersey City Prostitution.  Available at adult bookstores anywhere.  Sirius XM. 
[02:52:00]  XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Now we're talking.  It's Doobie Brothers Day on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Why?  We don't know.  Listen to that riff.  The Edge can't do this shit.  Turn it up!  When the sun comes up on a sleepy little town 
[02:52:30]  Down around San Antonio  And the folks are rising for another day  Round to bounce their home  The people of the town are strange  And the crowd are well again  Well, you're talking about the time, the time will grow  Oh, oh, oh  Where are the time to grow  All right, good enough. 
[02:53:00]  That's good, though.  That's some good stuff right there, Sam.  You're missing out.  Missing out on the Doobie Brothers.  You should get the greatest hit start there.  It'll be nice.  Craig Robinson, everybody.  No.  Oh, it's Travis.  What?  Where is Craig Robinson?  This is Craig Robinson time.  Yes.  What is he promoting?  The animated movie that looks really good  That I'm going to have to bring my kid to.  Oh, man.  Escape from Planet Earth. 
[02:53:30]  Animated film in 3D opening February 15th.  That would be Friday.  And he's also promoting This is the End.  This is the End.  Full circle.  We've come full circle.  The End.  This is what we've talked about today in the show, Ant.  Bitched about the mics.  Bitched about the studio.  Bitch, bitch, bitch.  Talked about Jimmy's appearance on Artie Lang.  Let's not forget that.  Talked about the Doobie Brothers.  Talked about the Doors. 
[02:54:00]  Played a bunch of random clips from The Edge.  Played a couple random clips of Pink Floyd.  Discussed fruit.  And made fun of other radio shows.  Yeah.  It's a full day right there.  Sounds like a perfect O&A show to me.  I've got to tell you, when it's listed out like that,  there's something very complete about that.  Yes.  There is.  We shove a lot of material through these mics every day.  Right up your asses out there.  What?  Oh.  Here comes Craig Robinson.  Oh, Jerry Liner.  He worked.  Okay.  What happened?  No, he did something with Jerry, who I love.  Come on, Craig Robinson.  Take a seat, sir. 
[02:54:30]  Welcome to Opie and Anthony.  We're on the air.  And, of course, Jim Norton.  We're on the air right now.  We just do it like that.  I like that.  Some people, you bring people in during commercial break,  and then you sit there going like...  Or someone says something really compelling,  and you're like, oh, say that on the air.  And then it just comes across as like...  It doesn't work that way, right?  As rehearsed, almost.  Exactly.  We're a little distracted.  We're going to talk about your movie and everything,  but a story is hitting as we speak.  What is this?  National Enquirer, world-exclusive, O.J. Simpson, gay shocker. 
[02:55:00]  What?  Uh-oh.  O.J.'s gay?  I don't believe it.  I think someone is just being a complete asshole.  How is O.J. gay?  I don't know who they're even talking to in this story.  Somebody that O.J. talked to at home,  they're saying that he kept talking about who...  Do you know...  Are you fall football?  Yeah.  Is there a receiver named Anquan something?  Or whatever.  They said O.J. just kept talking about how good-looking he was,  whoever he plays for the Raiders.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That's how they figure O.J.'s gay?  No, but they're saying that he works out without a... 
[02:55:30]  O.J.'s just trying not to get raped in jail,  and they're implying that he's gay.  It's just literally the Enquirer just throwing shit at the wall.  Anquan Bolden?  Yeah, I guess so.  They said O.J. kept commenting on how handsome he was.  And he only talks about how handsome guys are all of a sudden.  Yeah, well, he probably doesn't want to think about pussy.  It's like if you're in jail for fucking 12 years,  you don't want to think about fucking.  What year is he in now?  About his 50s?  Five.  We think year five.  That's it.  Oh, man.  They start looking at releasing them after nine, I guess, right?  Or could it be sooner than that? 
[02:56:00]  2017 is his earliest parole eligibility, I think.  God, and he was free.  He was free.  How do you mess that up?  He got away with murder, and then his memorabilia screwed him up.  What a dope.  You beat a double murder.  Let the signed ball go.  Like, what the fuck are you doing?  You beat the rap.  Yeah.  What a stupid ass.  I almost said poor O.J.  Holy shit.  I know.  I know.  First he has to put up with a fucking wife, and then... 
[02:56:30]  Exactly.  Takes care of business.  Want some twink driving around in his carts?  Exactly.  But this has nothing to do with Craig Robinson.  No, I know.  No, but...  We're going to come on now.  We just got that.  Well, yeah.  It's hot.  There's a hot story there.  We just got handed that before you came in.  It's just because he commented on somebody's physique.  And he works out a lot, and he surrounds himself with...  In prison.  That's what you do.  Of course.  They said, well, he's always working about his body, but that's because he's idiot.  He doesn't want to be weak or seem older.  Some of the quotes.  Now O.J. has way too much interest in guys, and he likes to show off his body to the hardened felons 
[02:57:00]  when they exercise in the prison yard.  He doesn't even talk about women, just about guys.  Well, that's protective.  That's so he doesn't get raped and beat up.  Yeah.  You know what?  Your dessert's taken.  No one's raping O.J.  No, but you never know.  Somebody might want to take him out.  But he is like a god to the other inmates, it continues.  You know, we have Craig in here.  What are we doing?  Well, it says he prances around, flexing his muscles, wearing only a pair of gym shorts.  I know.  You sexy it up in here.  The point is, this is ridiculous, Craig Robinson. 
[02:57:30]  That's what we're getting at.  Agreed.  Okay.  Agreed.  Escape from Planet Earth, this is going to be a big movie.  Oh, I hope so, man.  I hope so.  Oh, yeah.  Please.  Everybody takes their kids.  Is this your first kids movie?  No, I did Shrek 4.  Oh, you did?  Shrek 4 After, yeah.  What'd you do?  I was, my character's name is Cookie.  I wasn't Gingerbread Cookie.  My character, I was an ogre who was the cook for the other ogres on the ground. 
[02:58:00]  How much is it to do voiceover?  Like, it always seems like it would be kind of, like, I heard Eddie Murphy's the master  of, like, he can go in and knock out a whole film in, like, 10 or 12 hours.  They said Murphy is the fucking voiceover king.  It is, well, it depends on what they want you to do, you know.  They kept writing stuff for this character, so I probably did six sessions at three or four  hours a piece.  But it's laid back, it's chill.  It's as most fun as you're going to have, you know, in Hollywood, probably, because  you get to, you know, no hair, makeup, you just roll in, you do your thing.  Do you got to, but do you have to watch the guy's mouth and then work with the mouth, 
[02:58:30]  or do they do your voice first?  Then they animate afterwards, yeah.  Yeah, they animate to you.  I don't know how they do that.  That was, like, your question that his aunt probably would ask him.  I should know more about show business.  Fucking.  That just goes to show Jimmy has never done an animation.  Dude, I literally ask questions that your fucking mailman asks you.  I'm not in this business at all.  Complete idiot.  Ah, shit.  So it's in fucking 3D?  Yeah.  That's the way you want to be, though.  That's, like, kids' movies are, that's why Eddie is so smart. 
[02:59:00]  It's like, he's still making 50 million a year.  They make the most money.  It's crazy what they make.  So you had to be real interested in seeing what this does.  No, why?  Because there's not enough of these films out there.  So if you're a parent, which I am there, Craig Robinson, you eat up all these.  You buy every single one.  It doesn't even matter if it's bad.  And kids also see a movie more than once.  And parents buy the DVD every time.  And then it leads to all the fucking toys and everything else.  Yeah.  It's endless.  Are you the lead?  Yeah.  No, no, no. 
[02:59:30]  The lead is Rob Corddry and Brendan Fraser.  Brendan Fraser?  Okay.  Yeah, I'm one of the cats in the prison.  Area 51.  My character's Doc.  He's a mouse-like alien.  And he's an intergalactic radio talk show therapist who invented social network.  Wouldn't that be, like, as great as that role is for a kid's movie?  Imagine if that wasn't a cartoon, how, like, you would never want to do that.  Yeah, right?  If it wasn't an animated thing, you'd be like, no, I don't think I want to play that guy. 
[03:00:00]  I don't want that role.  Oh, that sounds pretty good, though.  I saw the trailer for it.  Gervais is in that, too, right?  Yeah, Gervais, Jane Lynch, George Lopez, Sofia Vergara.  Fuck.  Yeah, it's crazy, man.  Sarah Jessica Parker, Jessica Alba.  Do you do scenes with any of them, though?  Do you guys all, no one reads together?  Solo.  Everybody goes in solo.  That's so strange.  That is amazing.  And then they put it together, and everybody's all together.  It's a together movie.  It took a, you know, this director, Cal Bunker, who I met, you know, through this project,  he's dope. 
[03:00:30]  He had a vision for this thing.  And, you know, it was nice to see it coming together.  I would be in there, you know, each session, and each time he'd show me a little more animation  or a little more, you know, storyboard or whatever.  So to see the final product, which I did a couple Saturdays ago, the premiere was up.  So what do you do for, like, motivation?  Like, all right, here's a character.  I'm sure you can't just go in and stop going, hey, blah, blah, blah, you know.  They hold your check up in front of you. 
[03:01:00]  Well, like I said, the director, man, he really, you know, it was, it's a, he wrote it.  So him and his writing partner.  So his vision stayed true the whole time.  He kept you on point and that kind of stuff.  Like, you know, he just sitting there going, yeah, smile through it.  Oh, okay.  Doc is always, you know, happy and always has the answers, you know.  So, and even if you, that's the beauty of animation, too, you know, voiceover.  Even if you, like, start off flat and, like, you end up on a high note, it's like, okay, 
[03:01:30]  let's go back to the beginning and get that other stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  You're a good actor, dude.  You've done a lot of, I noticed you did, like, a lot of kind of, Arrested Development  was totally scripted?  Or was there, was there room to kind of, you know, I had, like, three lines in there.  So there really wasn't a lot of room in that one.  And how about, and then obviously in Curb and on The Office.  Curb, you improv in the audition and then that made it to the, to the final.  So whatever I improv in the audition was, was it.  And how much of The Office, because I always thought the original was, it was this big, 
[03:02:00]  you know, that seemed like it was all improvisation, but Gervais was like, no, every single line  was scripted.  And ours, you know, when Steve was there, he used to change it up quite a bit.  So you just had to be ready.  And then we get to play, but the writers have, like, you know, captured the voices.  So it's like, damn, that's exactly how I would say that.  So, yeah, you get to play some, you know, it's definitely encouraged, but it's pretty  much out there. 
[03:02:30]  Did he have...  Thank you for that, saying I'm a good actor.  You are.  You know, it's like, I'm always kind of happy slash nauseous when I see comedians doing  really well as actors, you know, because I'm not.  So I'm kind of like...  Oh, Jimmy.  No, but it's like, it's good to see comics doing really great acting work, and then you're  like, oh, fuck, I want to do more acting.  But, you know...  Come on out, man.  Nah, it's just, you know, I had no audition today that I just, I couldn't do because I'm  doing something else.  Exactly.  Go on tape.  Yo, New York cats, man.  But they said go on tape.  You can't go...  No, but I had to put myself on tape.  Like, they didn't even have a casting director for me to go... 
[03:03:00]  Yeah, it was for...  You got to set up your own camera in your apartment or something?  Yes!  My stupid manager goes, well, maybe you could do it on your iPhone.  I'm like, are you a manager in comedy?  Fuck up!  How about he films you, at least?  How about you, how about that?  How about he at least comes by and films you?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Get your iPhone handy.  It's nice to know we could just, like, bamboozle him and tell him that it's an audition.  Get the tape and then post it on YouTube.  It was actually for something, for two brokerals, it was really a funny...  Oh, damn.  It was a very big part. 
[03:03:30]  And you just didn't do it?  No, no, because it was...  I would have had to go on...  I'm taping something for NBC today, which is...  It's actually...  It's a show on air.  Michelle Beadle?  Is that how you say her name?  Yeah, she has a show.  It's like, I can't...  And I have to write for that.  So it's like, you can't give up a live TV taping for an audition on your iPhone or on tape.  You can't.  Look who's busy.  It's crazy.  You are busy, Jim.  Well, today.  Busy, Jim.  But it's not about today.  Wait, when does the two brokerals do?  It would have had to be done sometime today.  Because Craig wants to do it. 
[03:04:00]  You had an iPhone, Craig, if he got the part.  It was really a really funny part.  Why not have somebody at the NBC thing today film you and then you just email it off?  That would have been a great thought had I had it yesterday and looked at the script more than once.  Oh.  But no, I didn't.  My manager called and he talked to them and they said it's not...  It wasn't like they were just...  The casting director just likes me, so they weren't gunning to get me.  Gotcha.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Poor Jimmy.  Well, I had another thing today.  I couldn't... 
[03:04:30]  So it's not that bad.  And I got...  Yeah.  Where are you from originally?  Chicago.  Oh, well, not you.  Chicago, huh?  Yes, sir.  You get back there a lot?  I try to get back for holidays.  So I went back for Thanksgiving.  But then my sister just moved to Vegas, so we all went out there for Christmas.  But y'all try to get back for like a Mother's Day.  You got the family all over the place kind of a thing.  Exactly.  Yeah, it's a bitch.  My brother lives here, actually, in Brooklyn.  Are you from a nice part of Chicago or not a nice part of Chicago?  Southside.  It's the baddest part of town.  It's a mixture.  A little middle class slash hood. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is it like New York where one block is good and the next block is frightening and you better  know where you are at all times?  A little bit.  Yeah.  There's definitely a lot of that going on.  You can always tell, I did a gig there with Dice years ago, and when a guy, a driver,  will take you to the venue, but they always take you the route they know.  So if the guy is from the hood, he takes you through the hood.  That's how you get to the venue because that's the route he's most comfortable taking.  Yeah.  So this guy took us from the hotel.  Ooh.  Really? 
[03:05:30]  We went through a frightening year.  We went to the Rosemont Theater.  What was so frightening about it?  We didn't feel menaced, but you just knew that you were in a very dangerous place.  Yeah, you knew that.  Wow.  I was thinking of that scene in Vacation.  Excuse me, home?  Where's the highway?  Fuck your mama.  Fucking hilarious.  Is Cabrini Greens overrated or no?  I mean, I was gone now, but was that an overrated or was that really terrible?  No.  Back in the day, it was pretty dangerous to go through there.  And what was that about?  That's like the very famous.  Just the worst of the worst?  Yeah, man. 
[03:06:00]  That's like a really famous...  A famous project.  Right.  Like near downtown Chicago.  Yeah, it used to be...  I remember a buddy of mine, we were about to ask some police officers for some direction  or something.  I don't know why we stopped.  And he was like, yeah, they're having a shootout.  Can you guys go over there?  Yeah, they're a little busy right now, shooting.  We're going to have to move away.  So you would walk by there and have a problem, though?  Yeah, I could go down.  I used to teach down there, actually.  I used to...  Wow.  After school, I would go down and do a music program. 
[03:06:30]  What do you do music with?  Well, I play keys and sing.  And I used to teach K-8 music.  But then, yeah, I bounced out and went to Hollywood.  What do you sing?  Blues?  Do I sing?  Yeah, no, but I didn't know.  I know, Craig.  I didn't know you sang.  Hopefully blues, because we're all big blues fans in this room.  Not me.  I could do a little blues.  No, you're a fan.  You can.  But, you know, yeah, I just sing, you know, whatever.  I grew up singing, like, you know, classical, all kind of stuff, man. 
[03:07:00]  That's good for getting laid chicks like that.  They do.  They really do.  Women, nobody wants to fuck the drummer or the bassist.  Except the rest of the band.  They do like the drummer.  What?  They do like the drummer.  Really?  Yeah.  If you're Tommy Lee, maybe, or if you're Lars, but the drummers always have that weird  complex, because they're in the back.  You don't think Pete Best was getting any pussy?  Not without a pistol.  I used to be in the beat.  They'd say, what band did you used to be in?  And then he'd fucking smash him in the side of the head with a drumstick and fuck him. 
[03:07:30]  That's the only shot he had.  Hey, when Carell left, did you think the show was over?  Nah, because, you know, we had Greg Daniels, who ran King of the Hill, and, you know, he's  got Simpsons fame and all this, and he knows what he's doing with television.  It just was a matter of, like, the captain left the ship.  You know, let's get it straight.  Did you think Jervais might come?  There was a rumor that Jervais might come, and he might not come.  Did you think that was true or no?  Come in place of Carell? 
[03:08:00]  Yeah.  Nah, nah.  Or at least do something.  There were rumors he would just do a walk-on or something just to pump it up.  I think he did once.  Oh, he did?  He did a walk-on.  When Steve was leaving, they met each other in the hallway.  Oh, that's right.  It was really quick.  And they kind of had this, like, mutual respect, like, hey, you as goofy as I am.  I forgot about that.  You're right.  Yeah, but other than that, nah, I don't.  Nobody was trying to come in there.  They got James Spader for a minute, you know.  What happened to Spader?  I mean, he's a great actor.  Yeah, he's dope.  Did he stink in that? 
[03:08:30]  No, no.  I love what Spader was doing.  You know, it was like Shakespeare when he's on set, for real.  He's, you know, he's doing these long monologues, and just watching him act is great.  I don't know the whole, you know, inner workings of his contract or this, that, and the other,  but it turned out he just did a year.  Oh, all right.  I didn't think he did a full year.  Well, James Spader's a movie actor.  I wonder if he's doing TV, he hated it.  A lot of movie guys fucking hate doing television.  TV guys always seem to want to go do movies, but it seems like a lot of times movie guys  don't want to do TV. 
[03:09:00]  I don't know.  I see a lot of them coming in.  Yeah, I think it's sort of changing.  He's got a lot more credibility now, because they've opened up a lot more with some of these  networks.  Keith and Sutherland doing the 24.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah.  Kevin Bacon on now.  There's a lot more latitude now than there used to be on television.  You get away with a lot more, you know, creatively, creatively, creatively.  Right, like who else?  Christian Slater did a series.  I guess, you know, once a few guys do it, the rest of them are like, fuck it, we're not  going to take 80 grand a week or 100 grand a week, whatever they make.  I don't know, right?  So you get recognized everywhere, but no one knows your name? 
[03:09:30]  Is that the deal you got?  That's exactly what goes on.  Yeah, yeah.  It's that Daryl, office!  That guy.  Knocked up!  Yeah, once in a while they'll know.  But I think that's right after you catch them Googling, you know, office, Daryl, uh-huh.  How are you, Craig Rowe?  This is funny.  You see people do some things beforehand, and you're like, oh, they're on to me.  It's a good thing to have. 
[03:10:00]  You ever see them looking down at the phone and looking up at you?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  I know this guy.  You ever see them taking a picture of you, like stealing a picture?  Yeah.  Um, no.  No.  Once, outside a schoolyard once?  No.  No.  But I, uh, they'll usually come up and ask.  Because people who like me kind of know that I'm very accessible, and, you know, they'll  just come up and ask.  But you catch them looking sometimes, but I never know why they're looking.  If it's recognition or if it's just a little... 
[03:10:30]  Disgust.  Yeah.  If it's a girl, I never know why a girl's looking.  I never want to assume she knows who I am.  A buried memory working its way to the surface.  Yeah, exactly.  He reminds me of my uncle.  You know, some fucking creep in the past.  Does it bother you that Michelle Obama's brother is also named Craig Robinson?  Yeah, man.  Not in the least.  Okay.  Because that's the first...  Did you just learn that on your phone?  Wait, is that the first Google that comes on now?  Yeah, I'm sorry to tell you that.  It used to be me.  Okay, I got to get back up there.  Oh, man.  He was seen a lot in the inauguration, so I moved them back up to number one. 
[03:11:00]  We got to get you back at number one as far as Craig Robinson's go.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, I did know that.  I was just checking some other shit.  Have you met Obama?  I have not met Obama.  I asked that just because somebody...  It's amazing how many celebrities get to go to the White House.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  I would love to go there.  I know.  Me too.  I want to do that correspondence, then apparently that's the one to go to.  Oh, that's the big thing to go to, yeah.  That's a rough gig, though.  As a comedian, that's a...  Like, Leto ate his balls there.  He had a tough time.  He had some laughs and some tough moments and some laughs and some tough moments. 
[03:11:30]  That's a tough...  That's a tough...  Yeah.  Did you see when Colbert did it?  Mm-mm.  But he just went straight against Bush.  He didn't...  He had a rough time, too, right?  Oh, yeah.  It was like no laughs.  He just was doing a speech.  Oof.  But he can handle that.  He seems to be the type of guy that can handle that.  It was dope.  Yeah.  Yeah, he had a rough time.  I know.  I miss had a really rough time.  Seth killed...  They loved Seth.  Seth Meyer killed.  He was genuinely comic funny.  He's dope. 
[03:12:00]  Wow.  I saw him host one of those ESPYs one time.  Mm-hmm.  He was really good.  Wanda did well.  I thought she was really ballsy because she had a line about 9-11, which she did in front  of Bush, about Rush Limbaugh being the 20th hij...  Oh, no, she did in front of Obama, about Rush Limbaugh being the 20th hijacker or something.  Like, I was...  You know what?  I was like, fucking tip your hat to anyone doing a 9-11 joke in front of the act of sitting  president.  Yeah, yeah.  But that's a gig you probably wouldn't want.  Didn't Whoopi do one once or something?  I'm not sure.  I don't know. 
[03:12:30]  I don't remember her doing something and getting a lot of shit for it.  That was with Ted Danson.  Oh, yeah.  Was that the course numbers?  No, no.  I mean, after that.  I think she did something, and language-wise, they were all like, it's like, shut the fuck  up, man.  I'm going to Google that.  People are...  Are you Googling that?  I'm going to Google that.  Like, people invite people to come and do this stuff, and then they get all pissed off  when they do what they do.  It's like, fucking shut up.  Well, yeah.  I guess they expect you to be clean.  Like, Seth is a good choice for that.  He works clean.  His whole existence on SNL is clean on live TV. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah.  So, you know, don't get a guy who's going to be edgy or dirty.  It's silly.  Yeah.  What else you got in the pipe there, as they say, in the pipe?  Not much.  Not you, Jimmy.  The office, you know, is ending, and we have four episodes left, and I'm going into production  on a sitcom, my own joint.  It's untitled, but it focuses on me playing in a band at night and then being a music teacher  doing a day kind of thing.  It's going to be a one-camera shoot, right? 
[03:13:30]  A single-camera, yeah.  Now, is that, which means half of it will be improv, or are you going to do the same  thing and script most of it?  Oh, well, you know, I have free reign to play around.  It's definitely scripted, a scripted series, but, you know, you get to play.  So, it's not like you come in like, okay, make up a scene.  It's already.  What's the push to the story?  You're a musician who's...  I, yeah, I get a teaching gig, and it's like just an inappropriate kind of dude in front  of a class of kids.  Oh, okay.  How old are the kids?  It's a junior high. 
[03:14:00]  All right.  So, maybe you have like a...  This is what I used to do.  Come on.  Stop running in the hallway.  I was just like, you know, I know how to do this.  I'm very good.  Come on, Jim.  Are you auditioning right now?  I'm just letting Craig know that I'd be very good.  Give me your iPhone.  Oh, clap the erasers.  Clap the erasers.  You got to get this on your iPhone.  What's wrong with you?  I would just come in and improv the scene.  I would just do all old man references.  Where's your chalk?  Boo.  Are you bumming The Office is ending?  It's been a long run.  Well, yeah.  It's that bittersweet. 
[03:14:30]  The sweet part is getting my own show.  But the end is like, you know, you just wonder what...  Yeah, it's bumming.  It's bummy.  Yeah, because, I mean, you've been hanging out with those people for a long time.  Nine years.  Nine years.  Wow.  But you got syndication, at least.  I mean, that's the, you know...  Yeah, I wasn't in all episodes, though.  You know, I started off in a couple here, a couple there, and then the last couple seasons.  Oh, okay.  I've been all produced, so...  So it's...  It's still not like...  I'll get retired.  That means that's not pay or play. 
[03:15:00]  That's the best.  Pay or play is the best.  I hope he gets some good pocket money, though.  Oh, yeah.  He's going to get some nice pocket money.  What did you do with Jerry Minor, too?  Jerry was in Lucky Louie, who I love Jerry.  He's the best deadpan in fucking history.  Jerry's dope.  Yeah, he's very funny.  We did a song called Somebody's Fucking My Lady.  And, you know, that song...  When I went to audition for The Office, the creator, Greg Daniels, was like...  It doesn't get much funnier than that, you know?  And when I went to audition for Knocked Up, same thing. 
[03:15:30]  Jerry Apertise, I was like, that's the funniest thing I ever saw.  So that definitely got me a lot of...  Hmm.  That's what you need.  Is a good fucking...  Was it audio or was it a video?  It's a...  You know, we just did it on, like, four different shows.  Cedric the Entertainer, the Comedy Central Commies.  We did it on Bill Maher.  And then it was a joint called Sketchpad, too.  So, um...  And it was just like these two 70s characters.  One is Elle Witherspoon and Chucky.  I was a sidekick, Chucky.  And, yeah, you gotta see the video.  But it's up on YouTube. 
[03:16:00]  But it was never a produced video.  It was always one of these shows.  What'd you do on Bernie Mac's show, too?  He's a comic I never met, but Bernie was a fucking...  He was a funny dude.  Bernie's from Chicago, man.  Bernie...  All respect to Bernie.  I just did, you know, a guest star on his show one time.  But he used to have...  In Chicago, he used to have a room where...  It was Tuesday night, and at 8 o'clock, you know, the show started.  But at 5 o'clock, the room was packed.  Because everybody was coming to see Bernie do his thing. 
[03:16:30]  And he would showcase two Chicago comedians and two Chicago singers.  And he was, you know, doing sketches and all that in between.  I mean, it was awesome.  Wait, the show...  People just got there early because the seats would be gone?  They got there early.  Yeah, it was a small club called Miltreneers.  And the bottom of a Hyatt or Holiday Inn or something downtown.  And, yeah, it was like, you know, 125 seats or something like that.  So...  This is after he was already huge?  Yeah, and he was on his way. 
[03:17:00]  It was before Kings of Comedy and that kind of stuff.  Before the Bernie Mac show.  He wasn't on television.  Was it after Def Jam or before?  Because he had a defining Def Jam set.  It was after Def Jam.  Yeah, it was after Def Jam.  I think whoever was on...  I think we talked about this before.  Whoever was on before him absolutely died.  And they were a rough crowd that night.  And he came on and...  I ain't scared of you, motherfuckers.  Opening line.  I ain't scared of you.  And fuck it.  It was a really weird, defining moment.  Like, very rare.  Or can you see someone's life?  Like, that was the moment that made him famous. 
[03:17:30]  He became a big star after that.  Yeah.  I need that moment.  I've tried that, but I do it at the wrong times.  I'm not scared of you like a veteran in senior citizen homes.  Oh, yeah.  I bully the elderly.  Oh, fuck, man.  I would love to do that.  I want to do a sketch where I bully the elderly.  Not even a comedy.  Oh, man.  I keep seeing your face in your book.  Your picture you took with Al Roker.  Oh, God.  Yeah, that was at the fucking...  The Trump roast, I think.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:18:00]  But the actual pic to, you know, the little surprise in the middle of the book.  That was dope.  Was that where I fucking bashed him?  You were bashing him, and all of a sudden, you were, like, smiling with him.  That was the Pat Cooper roast.  I took a picture of him and Pat Cooper.  I had a thing with Al Roker, too, where Ron and Fez, the show after us, were interviewed.  We had just come over to here, and they were interviewing him one day.  And so they're like, well, do you want to call in today?  We're going to have Al Roker.  I'm like, well, no.  He's never...  I've said what I had to say in my book.  But then I get a call on my cell phone, and they're like, hey, Al Roker's here. 
[03:18:30]  Do you want to come on?  So I assumed they had been talking about this, and they were asking me.  So I'm like, well, I don't want to be a pussy.  If I said it in my book, and they're asking me to, you know, he wants to...  I have to say yes.  You can't cower.  So then they put me through, and it goes, Ron goes, hey, Jim, Al Roker's here.  And I'm like, hey.  And then he goes, what do you got?  And they just kind of put me on the spot.  Oh, no.  So then I had to call him out for getting Imus fired, and he felt like he was...  What's the word?  Sandbagged or... 
[03:19:00]  Blindsided.  Blindsided.  Blindsided.  Yeah, yeah.  Ambushed.  Ambushed.  That's the word.  Bushwhacked.  Yeah, no, ambushed.  You've been bamboozled.  Hoodwing.  Yeah, no, it was that.  All right, well, that's my Al Roker story.  I like that story.  And just in time, because we are wrapping up.  Yes, we are.  Yes, we are.  10 o'clock, we finish.  For another day.  We're done?  Yes.  Hold on.  We're right on schedule, as they say in the early old English.  Escape from Planet Earth with Craig Robinson, animated film at 3D opens Friday.  I'll be there.

[03:26:00]  We're live.  What?  How do you think the show went today?  I love today's show.  Yeah?  I was in a really good mood today.  And I don't like being in good moods because I have this weird thing when I'm in a really good mood.  I just start writing checks for people.  I just see.  Yeah, you've been sitting there with your checkbook for a while.  No, no.  He's not going to get one, is he?  Look, I got.  It's weird.  When I'm in a good mood, I don't know where this comes from.  But check writing.  Like, how many checks do I have in front of me, for real? 
[03:26:30]  One, two, three, four, five.  Yeah, but I see, five checks I see.  And I see the name of the guy who's on the first check.  He doesn't need one.  No, I know.  But that's...  That's just your mood.  Yeah, it just proves how good of a mood I'm in today.  Why are you in such a good mood?  I don't know.  I'm in a really good mood.  And it just leads to me writing checks.  It's a weird phenomenon with me.  Is that what my...  That's why I try to be in a pissy, bitchy mood all the time, so I don't have to write checks.  And you just start giving out money otherwise?  Yeah, that's exactly what's happening right now.  Am I lying?  No, you're writing...  You're literally... 
[03:27:00]  You've been sitting here all commercial break writing checks.  Right.  And we've all pretended not to notice.  Everybody sees exactly what you're doing.  This one's for...  This one I just decided to write for a couple thousand dollars.  What?  Am I lying?  No, but why to him?  I could use some of that over here.  I don't know.  I'm telling you.  I'm just in a really good mood.  Like, I don't get it sometimes.  I don't get...  I don't...  Like, people are trying to figure me out.  I don't even understand myself sometimes.  I'm in a good mood, so I pulled out a checkbook, and I'm writing checks.  It's the God's honest truth.  Is that what Michael McDonald does to you? 
[03:27:30]  Yeah, I guess.  You think that's what it was?  Just don't put me in a good mood too often, or I'll be fucking broke.  You know what Michael McDonald does to me?  Look.  It gets me annoyed.  Look.  That was obvious today.  Oh, I get one.  I'm just...  Look, it's...  Here.  Just here.  Here.  I don't care.  I'm going to cash this quick,  because you do get upset easily.  Here.  Give that to Roland.  Roland, you get a check.  Who else?  Yeah, Sal.  Come on in.  Everybody who wants a check, come in.  Yeah, hurry.  Everybody who wants a check.  Come in.  Here.  I can't believe Mars is getting one. 
[03:28:00]  If you want a check, you better come in here.  Sal.  Yeah, sure.  No problem.  Eric's running in here.  Here comes Sal.  Sal.  Here.  I don't understand.  Well, now hold your check.  This shit happens.  He is Puerto Rican.  Mars is not going to rob us for the checks.  I mean, you can't do much with them.  For real?  Yeah, I just don't know.  I'm in a good mood.  If anybody wants a check, you better get in here before.  Troy.  Where is Troy?  I'm fucking putting my coat on.  Oh, my God.  I don't know what happened.  Troy, you're missing out.  Travis hasn't gotten a check.  What happened? 
[03:28:30]  Here.  There you go.  There you go.  He's checks for whoever wants them.  I don't know what happened.  He's giving checks to whoever...  Money?  Oh, Fez is coming in.  Money?  Fez, here.  Here.  He's handing out checks.  Who's this?  Here, give this...  Travis is here.  There's a check for you.  I can't believe there's checks for everyone.  Give this to Fez.  I ran out of checks in my checkbox.  All right.  Here, I have some cash.  I give it to him when I see him.  No, give me that.  I don't trust you.  Give him that money.  I give it to him whenever... 
[03:29:00]  Fez, I got something for you.  Fez, he's handing out money.  Fez, I ran out of checks, but you can have some of my money.  Cash?  Look, if I had another check, I'd write you one, too.  I'll put it towards the wedding.  Look, did I run out of checks?  He ran out of checks, but Pips is in here.  I ran out of money, too.  I'm sorry.  Oh, you ran out of cash.  Well, here, here.  Just give it...  Here.  Pips, you're in here.  You get money, too.  Here.  Here, just give him that.  Give him a 20 spot.  There you go.  Just take it.  Have fun.  All right.  What do you get for coming in?  I hope he's in a good mood. 
[03:29:30]  Where's Sophie come from?  Where's Rob Cross?  I said when I'm in a really good mood, I just start writing checks.  I don't understand it.  I don't want to understand it.  Where's Rob Cross and Scott?  You'd think Gary would be running in here.  Well, I would have gave him money.  Although, you know what would happen?  If Gary ran in here, it would cost all of us money, because he'd be in a bad mood all of  a sudden.  Yeah, that's true.  There you go.  I hope he's generous with your bad mood.  Much appreciated.  It's a big number, too.  Thank you, sir.  Let's all give him a round of applause.  Yeah, let's keep him in a good mood.  No, don't do that. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah.  I'm telling you, it'll be a problem.  You still owe me money, too, by the way.  This doesn't cover that.  Shut up.  See you guys later.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  What does he owe you money for?  Remember the Cuban tip that one day?  Oh, yeah.  Well, I'm not worried about the Cuban.  Cuban can figure that out.  I could give a shit, but he owes me money because I edited a video for him.  What in God's name is this about?  He said he was in a good mood.  Yeah, Michael McDonald put him in the mood.  Michael McDonald.  He was listening to him earlier.  He plays it every day.  He was listening to Michael McDonald earlier. 
[03:30:30]  And how come our intern walks in at the end?  He was giving out money.  There was money being given out in here.  You missed it.  Pips got money.  Pips from Ron and Fez got money.  Fez got money.  Sal got money.  We should see if this is a joke.  I should run to the bank and cash it.  Cash these now.  I will go right now.  Yeah, cash it.  Let me know if it clears, Mars.  Bye.  Bye.  Wow.  I don't know what to say.  We got some stupid interns.  Neither one of them walked in here while that was all happening.  Give me my pen back.  We lost that on the money.  You're going to steal my pen now? 
[03:31:00]  Wow.  What were you thinking?  What's your name again?  Dave.  Dave.  I don't know we were giving out money.  Well, you got to listen to the after show.  Am I the only one around here who knows we're doing a show?  I was in the middle of something.  I wasn't even listening to the show.  And all of a sudden, I heard yelling out in the hallway.  You got to listen every day because Opie just said he was in a good mood.  Yeah.  And whoever comes in the studio is getting money.  Because he just showed you, look, Sam, I have a check.  And then you just start passing him out.  Dude, he gave a check to Sal.  Wow.  If Sal's getting a check, literally anybody who walked in this room could have gotten something. 
[03:31:30]  Yeah.  I think Sal turned a corner, though, last week with Opie.  Fez got a check.  Pip's got a check.  Everybody.  Except our stupid interns who decided to sit around with their thumbs up their ass instead  of listening to the show.  Good.  I'm glad it cost them money.  Rob Cross didn't come out.  You snooze, you lose.  Well, like I said, I'm glad nobody in management was in here.  Bob Cross did that.  It would have cost us our checks.  If anyone in management had been in this room, it would have cost us our checks.  I had to punish one of the interns today.  Which one?  This one, Dave?  No, the other one.  I had to...  The other one's the one that Sal and Eric yell at all the time. 
[03:32:00]  No, he was fine, but I had to make him watch gay porno all morning.  Oh, that was just his assignment today?  Yeah.  Is that all in preparation for tomorrow's gay off?  Yep.  Are you excited?  Oh, yeah.  Are we saying farewell to gay tomorrow?  That's what the word from Opie was.  We're saying farewell.  Well, then tomorrow I have three penthouse girls to pitch, so we'll see.  Okay.  Yeah, that's...  That'll be the telltale.  That'll be the telltale sign, I think is what he's trying to...  The telltale.  Yeah, the tattletale?  Somebody's going to rat us out?  I don't know.  Peter. 
[03:32:30]  Son of a bitch.  Peter.  Peter.  He would have given you a check, but he didn't pick up the phone.  Unfortunately.  I'm sure the listeners would have gotten checks, too.  He's gone.  He's long gone now.  God damn.  And broke as a joke.  Thank you, Peter, because he's giving out money.  Yeah.  Good amounts, too.  It's a generous check.  Yeah, I got a nice one, too.  He gave a check to Mars.  Wow.  Mars doesn't...  I mean, what does Mars do to get a check?  Screw up stuff? 
[03:33:00]  Well, you know how they are.  What do you mean they?  Yeah, exactly.  You mean Mars.  You know Mars.  Yeah, Roland, the self-hating Mexican.  What do you mean they?  You know my people.  The Mexicans don't like the Puerto Ricans and vice versa.  Yeah, but Roland doesn't like Mexicans.  So it's like...  He likes Mexicans, right?  No, he doesn't.  I just love the food.  Let's go to Chaz.  Let me click the button.  Chaz, you're on After Opie and Anthony Live.  How you doing, Sammy boy?  I'm great.  I'm rich.  I'm rich, bitch.  Yeah, I'm sure you are.  Oh, for me, you know. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah, I understand.  It doesn't take a lot.  Well, you make $2,800 a year.  I'm almost up to $3,000.  With this check, it's a good $3,000 a year.  Jesus Christ.  You're going to be buying speedboats.  Well, hey, here's the thing.  I learned something today.  What'd you learn?  I learned that little sweet, cute Jimmy shares his pants with Troi Kwan.  Yeah, I Instagrammed a photo of Jim while he was sleeping today.  He was sleeping on the show.  And I thought Mr. Funny Guy has so many comments to make about my shirt.  Why don't I Instagram a picture of Jim out and everybody started commenting on the fact 
[03:34:00]  that he's wearing pre-ripped jeans.  So, okay, here we go.  Yeah, I got goofed on for that.  You did?  Remember?  I do.  I had diesels.  He's wearing Kwan pants.  He is.  What were you saying, Chaz?  It looks like he has pockets full of roofies and ecstasy to throw around to Raver girls.  It looks like Troi Kwan-ish at best.  Do you ever drug women, Troi?  Nope.  Never.  Good for you.  Never.  That's a stand-up quality I look for in people.  Man, everybody's just in a good mood around here. 
[03:34:30]  Back to work.  Yeah.  I'm telling you, you've got to listen to this show, though.  You better keep that radio on, Troi.  You never know when somebody's going to walk in here and be like,  Hey, who wants some money?  I know.  Because you were not in here.  I thought you were going to miss it.  We started yelling, where's Troi?  Yeah.  Troi's a guy who loves free money.  Roland and I, we should go get handjobs with this.  Yeah.  Are you going?  I think you'll like.  We've been talking about it.  Oh, taking another visit to our spot.  Yeah.  I mean, we should graduate from sharing dessert and then making an apple pie now to this. 
[03:35:00]  Well, we've gotten handjobs together before.  It's not a graduation if you've done it before.  Oh.  You're just doing it again because you enjoy desserts and handjobs.  And we love barbecue and handjobs.  You enjoy sugar and being milked.  And delicious meats.  Well, I don't know if you want to put that in the category of handjobs.  People are going to get the wrong idea.  We're bros.  Yeah, we're bros.  Whatever.  Of course you are.  So you think that's what you're going to do with your newfound wealth?  I don't know.  Get a handjob?  No. 
[03:35:30]  What about you, Sal?  With your newfound wealth, what are you going to do?  How's the hair growing in?  Yeah, it feels great.  Let me see.  Lift up your shirt.  Let me see your belly.  Oh, it's not really growing in.  It's still smooth.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's just for Go Go Harder.  That's true.  We do have a gay entertainer coming in tomorrow named Go Go Harder.  Go ahead and Google his name.  And look up this guy.  Tomorrow is the big gay off.  You heard us promoting this contest.  Now, the deal is we're going to have three or four guys.  I don't know how many guys.  Three or four guys are going to come in here. 
[03:36:00]  And they're all going to bring their wives.  And their wives are going to sit down and watch as one at a time, our entertainer, Go Go Harder.  Go ahead and Google a photo of him if you think I'm joking.  He's going to do a lot of gay acts to these men.  The only way to get the gay acts to stop is to tap out.  Or your wife can tap out for you.  At which point the actions will stop.  Whoever lasts the longest gets $1,500 from our buddy Steven Singer. 
[03:36:30]  So Go Go Harder will be in tomorrow.  Are you still planning on fluffing him?  After last week, I'm a little traumatized from all the, you know.  It seems like you've done enough.  To me.  To me.  That's just to me.  I'll do whatever tomorrow.  But you, Troy.  For whatever, you know.  Well, can I, according to the notes and stuff, and this was Troy's idea.  I don't want to take credit for it, but you got waxed, but wasn't he supposed to be bronzed too?  You were supposed to be bronzed for tomorrow.  Can we do that tomorrow?  Yeah, I'm cool with, like, getting bronzed. 
[03:37:00]  All right, we'll get some bronzer.  So, uh, Troy will be in charge of bringing in the self-tanner, I guess.  He's got the cash.  He's got a handjob in a self-tanner.  He can expense it.  So are you liking the smooth you?  I, I, I...  Do you still have no pubic or asshole hairs?  I'm, no, I got nothing, dude.  He farts louder.  Dude, my farts are so fucking loud.  Really?  They're so loud.  The hair actually muffled them.  Yeah, I remember Dr. Steve was talking about it on his show, and, um, something just, I guess,  the, your ass hairs kind of hold your ass more together, and now I got this fucking, like, amplifier. 
[03:37:30]  It's amazing.  And it just, it's just right out of your body.  Yeah, when you...  It just, it slides against those creamy white buttcheeks of yours.  It's crazy, and, uh, and when you shit, it's usually just like, it's like one or two wipes now.  It's quick.  Oh, right, because nothing, there's no more dingleberries.  Nothing.  What are they going to get stuck in?  Nothing.  It's, it's crazy, dude.  What's up, Travis?  Nothing.  Oh, you're just hanging out?  Yeah, I mean, we're talking about gay stuff.  So you're like, I mean, I gotta be in for this.  Let me come on down.  The expert is here, Dr. Gay.  Yeah, we have three couples tomorrow. 
[03:38:00]  And they're bringing in their wives.  They've been told to show up with their wives.  And we made a list.  The list that we've put together of gay stuff that has to go down, like, I can't imagine  that people are going to survive the whole list.  I just set the list off to Go-Go Harder.  What did he, did he say anything yet?  Well, it was like two seconds ago.  Go-Go Harder is he, now, we found him because he's a friend of yours, right?  Quote, unquote?  Yeah, I mean...  He's somebody that you've known.  If we want to keep things vague, yeah.  You called it an intimate friend, and I said, Travis, what did you say, friend?  I said I have an acquaintance.  Yeah.  Who I've known for a long time.  His yo-gabba-gabba buddy. 
[03:38:30]  So, I don't know what that means.  Sal.  I went to go see yo-gabba-gabba.  I guess that has to do with gay porn somehow.  What does that sound like?  I'm not quite sure how.  What are you going to use your newfound wealth for?  I don't know.  This is awesome.  He was handing out checks.  It's crazy.  Opie.  You don't know.  I mean, we've heard Troy and Roland are both going to get hand jobs.  Yeah.  Troy's also going to get some bronzer with it.  He's going to get enough so he has a little left over for himself, because the girls go  crazy for a bronze guy in the club.  What are you thinking?  I don't know.  How much was the wax the other day?  You're thinking...  Just three up, like, in a couple weeks. 
[03:39:00]  Maybe you'll bank a little of that money and get a second waxing.  Dude, I'm telling you...  It's $300 for that.  It's surprisingly nice.  Like, you know how, like, when your hair is, like, on your shirt and stuff?  Sure.  It's nice.  The whole balls and shit, that's a little weird.  But the chest isn't bad.  So maybe you'll go back and get your chest and pits waxed?  Yeah, my chest, pits, maybe my back, you know, my back pussy, that little thing.  You have a back pussy?  Well, you know, that little patch that grows...  Like a vagina?  ...the tailbone area.  That's where your vagina is?  Yes.  Right there in your back? 
[03:39:30]  Why would you call it that?  Because he's a pussy.  This is what it's called.  His mom used to call it that.  Don't forget to wash your back pussy, Sal.  Barry Manilow's playing.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, that's very exciting.  I'd recommend the chest wax.  To get your chest and back pussy waxed.  Yeah.  That's what you're going to use the money for.  Maybe, maybe.  Travis?  It'll probably go to my kid.  Jesus, that's not fun, is it?  I don't do anything fun for myself.  You get some wealth.  I hope he's just handing out money for no reason. 
[03:40:00]  And then you're like, oh.  Go straight to the kid.  I guess I'll buy Lunchables with it or something.  Kids still eat Lunchables?  I still eat Lunchables.  Who doesn't?  They're delicious.  Okay.  You get a little, you know, bite-sized candy at the end.  Right.  That's your reward.  Yeah.  Sometimes you go nuts and you make like a, yeah, mini-stickers.  Yeah.  How about you, Eric?  What are you going to use your wealth for?  I always love hearing how you're going to spend your money.  I know what he's going to do.  It's not that exciting.  It's going to buy a new fridge.  Okay.  Anyway, Eric, how are you going to eat?  It's going to throw towards my mortgage. 
[03:40:30]  Your mortgage.  Wow.  Let me take a couple calls.  I have a question about your house, though, Eric.  I thought it was going to be access pocket money.  Just access pocket money?  Yeah, like WWE, isn't that what it's called?  Oh, yeah, you're right.  You're not going to save the money and bring it to the WWE Fan Fest so you can get all kinds of goodies?  I'll have other money.  You will by that time.  Yeah, I mean, we're talking about Eric here.  He will have other money.  Eric's got stacks on stacks right now.  Todd in Dallas. 
[03:41:00]  I'm good.  I didn't ask.  Hey, I'm Todd.  You know, I think you should do a segment on Sal for Black History Month,  because he's the show's whipping boy.  I'm good, Sam.  Thank you.  Thank you for asking.  Yes, I'm glad.  I love the callers.  Glad you contributed there.  Well, don't say, I love the callers.  Can you get somebody like Larry or Mongo or all these guys?  There are some good callers.  That are fucking killing it on an everyday basis.  Then you get a dude like this.  I already forgot his name.  Todd, who's good. 
[03:41:30]  Good Todd.  If you ever want to call back again, good Todd.  Rich in Florida.  Hey, I was wondering if Troy, as a goof, is going to French kiss all three of the dudes tomorrow.  Just as like a goof?  Like, hey, we're all having fun, right?  Yeah, because he loves to goof on men by French kissing them.  Is that right?  Because he loves to goof on men by French kissing them.  It's 1028.  Roland has already signed his check.  It's already been endorsed. 
[03:42:00]  That's right.  Are you doing the thing where you take a photo of it and you cash it?  Yeah, he's got time for this.  He's doing it.  He's already cashing it.  I don't know if Troy is playing on French kissing any of the men.  We have a gay entertainer to do gay things to these men.  Troy shouldn't have to, quote unquote, do any gay acts.  But he may join the party.  I mean, he's down for whatever.  He's made that very, very clear.  And this guy seems like he would be down for whatever.  Well, his name's Go-Go Harder.  Travis and I called him yesterday.  I wish we had a copy of his voicemail. 
[03:42:30]  How was it?  We called him yesterday and we got his voicemail.  And it just goes, hello, you've reached Go-Go Harder.  With reverb.  Yeah, there's reverb on his voicemail.  Leave a message.  And then he goes, buh-bye.  I think he's going to be great.  He's going to be awesome.  I think so.  He's awesome.  He's a good looking dude.  You think he's a good looking guy, Troy?  Yeah, he looks like he's ready to have a good time.  So you're going to save some of this money and maybe see what you can get out of Go-Go Harder?  I mean, you know, we'll see what happens, you know?  Were you, because the caller wanted to know, he knows that you like to just goof around by French kissing guys, which I didn't know. 
[03:43:00]  I never knew that either.  You didn't, but the caller knew.  Are you planning on French kissing the contestants tomorrow?  You know, it's really, if it's for the show.  It's for the show.  Yeah.  Sal, would you French kiss the contestants tomorrow?  I just realized that I have less hair than this guy.  Let me take a look.  Oh, yeah, we're taking a look at Go-Go Harder, our entertainer for tomorrow's Gay Off right now.  And, yes, I see some hair in the armpits.  Sal, you do indeed have less hair at this moment than Go-Go Harder. 
[03:43:30]  Than Go-Go Harder.  Would you French kiss Go-Go?  For the show, I'm saying, obviously.  It's just like a cesspool of...  Well, who knows?  I'm sure he's very clean.  Yeah.  He looks like, look at him.  He's very handsome.  He looks like he likes to have fun.  He does.  He is a self-described boylesque dancer.  He's a boylesque dancer, Troy.  I mean, to say that he's a cesspool, couldn't we say the same thing about you?  You've been with a lot of women.  I like his sailor hat.  You like that.  Anthony will like that.  There's something very Nazi-ish about that picture. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah, but military, but not like a...  Military meets bondage.  Yeah, and that strikes me as Nazi-ish.  A little bit, yeah.  Maybe it's the pale skin.  Oh, Ant's gonna love him.  This is gonna be a very exciting day tomorrow.  Sal's bronzered body next to his.  You're gonna supply the bronzer?  Can you do that?  I'm like the liaison.  I don't even know where to get bronzer.  Where do you get bronzer from?  Probably Dwayne Reed or something.  I don't know.  It's the same place you get all your other beauty projects.  I had to do 300 for this one. 
[03:44:30]  Yeah, Roland had to expense Sal's full body waxing, and he's been extremely not shy about  making sure that everybody knows exactly how much he spent.  How many times is Roland gonna drop 300?  Oh, many more times.  Look at him there.  Look at him in that top right picture.  What is he, like a game show host there or something?  No, he's a boylesque dancer.  He's whatever you want him to be.  He's an entertainer.  That's right.  He's clothed in this one.  Why would you want to see that?  Let's look at this one.  That's weird.  That's a weird response.  There's weirdness going on, right?  But will you bronzer tomorrow? 
[03:45:00]  Absolutely.  Okay, cool.  If need be.  If need be.  If need be.  He needs like a bikini or something.  Yeah.  I got a listener submitted a goodbye to gay parody song.  Oh, and I know we're working on a couple different goodbye to gay stuff.  Yeah.  So, anybody who wants to do that overnight.  This one actually made me laugh a little.  Sal, why wouldn't you be working on a goodbye to gay thing?  Like, that's funny.  Too easy.  Because he doesn't, well, he doesn't want it to end.  Well, if Sal was like, hey, it's like, if you made like a testimonial or a song or something 
[03:45:30]  like that, where you are the one saying, like, I know I contributed to this, I need  to say goodbye to it.  It's just going to only be used against me.  There's no creative part of Sal's brain.  None.  None whatsoever.  We've got more from the listeners.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Although, Sal's willing to get a full body wax with his dick and balls included, so.  True.  And pews in your hair.  He'll always have that.  Everybody's, every, oh, yeah.  Are you so mad about that?  Sal made his bed.  Whoa.  Let me ask you about that, Sal.  I totally forgot that that even happened. 
[03:46:00]  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  On Friday.  Thank you, Roland.  I didn't mean to bring enough.  On Friday, when Sal was getting a, what are you laughing at in there, you rock?  Roland.  On Friday, when Sal was getting his dick and balls and asshole and taint waxed, those were  the parts that got waxed, right?  Pits, chest, vacuum.  And also, dick balls, asshole, taint?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  He, Sal wanted to be a funny guy, and they waxed his pubes off, and Sal was like, oh,  man, let me see that? 
[03:46:30]  And he took the thing, the wax with the hair all over it, and he slammed it onto Travis's  head, at which point Travis freaked out on him.  You didn't isolate that, did you, Eric?  He's on his phone.  No, he didn't.  No, he didn't.  It was awesome.  He's been, he's texting over there.  He's, he's got, he's got other things to do.  Guess how much I got.  Yeah.  He's just texting.  He's trying to figure out what toy stores are open at 11 a.m.  Hello, KB Toys.  What do you mean you're out of business?  But Travis got so fucking pissed, he started yelling at him. 
[03:47:00]  He said, are you serious?  Are you serious?  He said, you just lost the only guy around here that would back you up.  All this stuff.  Are you guys back on good terms, Sal?  I mean, I apologize and stuff afterwards.  Hopefully we're working towards.  I didn't ask if you apologize.  I asked if you're back on good terms.  I wouldn't say we were on the terms prior to that event.  What is, what has it been like?  Pre-pubes.  We've just been kind of quiet with each other.  What do you mean we've been quiet with each other?  Well, we haven't been chatting as much. 
[03:47:30]  Like, we don't.  How much have you been chatting?  None.  Why?  Because I put pubes on Travis's head the other day.  So you won't talk to him now?  No, no, no.  I tried, you know, apologizing.  Travis was like, no, leave, leave.  I was like, okay, okay.  Okay, so what you're telling me is.  I didn't say, no, leave, leave.  I told him it would be best if he got out of my office.  It only took me four and a half minutes to get there.  But what you're telling me is Travis won't talk to you.  Right now, yes.  Travis, you're fed up with Sal.  I have no use for Sal.  Now, how does that make you feel, Sal? 
[03:48:00]  I'm getting more production out of the listeners.  That's true.  I mean, you're not talking to Sal and everything is still kind of getting done, isn't it?  Yeah.  How does that make you feel that Travis wants no parts of you?  Yeah, especially after, like Troy said, how humiliating it is.  He's like, Troy had a great line.  He goes, how much does that suck when you got your dick out or something like that?  Right.  I was laughing at that line all afternoon.  So you're good with Troy?  Fine with Troy.  How are me and you?  We're great.  You and Roland?  Love Roland.  Eric?  Eh.  The management?  Eh.  Sal?  No. 
[03:48:30]  Wow.  Is there something, I mean, you want to...  In the meeting, you just got to point at him.  Maybe what you need...  I don't know what he's talking about.  Maybe what you want to do...  Who in the what meetings...  Roland's suggesting that I point at Sal during the meeting.  So when he calls our names, Travis, like, hey, what's up, Sam?  Then you say your shit.  Right.  Now he'll just go to Sal.  Okay, so that was your way of saying that we have a meeting today every Tuesday.  This is how much information, that joke, for the listeners to understand what you're talking about. 
[03:49:00]  This is how much it requires.  It's not for them.  No, I'm going to walk them through it.  It's fair.  I'm going to walk them through it so that they can be on board with it.  Roland said, today in the meeting, you should just point at him.  What Roland was getting at was, every Tuesday, we have a staff meeting.  In that staff meeting, Travis goes around the room, mentions each one of us by name, asking us, what are we working on?  Instead of saying, Sal, what are you working on?  Since Travis isn't talking to him, what should Travis do, Roland? 
[03:49:30]  Just point at him.  Mars, did it cash?  I can't think of a better revenge.  Did you cash the check?  How important is my input right now?  Very, I guess.  Very?  Okay.  Why?  Opie's the shit.  Yeah, yeah.  Opie's the shit.  It cashed.  Let me tell you something.  It's a real check.  It's a real check.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, guys.  Not even five minutes after that check got into Mars' hand.  Are you kidding me?  You think I trust that blondie?  I thought he was playing a joke on me. 
[03:50:00]  He was just writing expired checks.  His coat was on, and he power-walked past my office to go downstairs.  You went right down to the bank?  Dude, I was sweaty.  I went to his bank, Citibank.  His bank.  Whatever.  Whatever bank it is.  And what, did you just ask for cash for it?  I walked in there, and the first thing they asked me was, do you have an account?  I said, no, I do not have an account, but I would like to cash a check that the account  holder does have an account here.  And all they asked me was for my ID, and they wanted me to open an account. 
[03:50:30]  But I said, no, no, no, no.  Let's not do that.  Let's just go ahead and cash your check.  It's your check.  It's your check.  Give me that money.  And they did it.  And they gave, how do you want it, sir?  It took a little wrong, though, for some reason.  Just for singles?  No, because I thought you stole them.  I thought so, too.  Were they putting the check up to the light?  Yeah, they held it up.  They turned it every which way.  Double checking signatures.  Hyroglyphics, whatever the fuck is on it.  Hang on, we need to call our handwriting expert before we can cash this check.  It's standard procedure, you understand. 
[03:51:00]  What shade is your skin tone, by the way?  Opie's the man, let me tell you.  Opie's the man, he wasn't playing around.  What are you going to do with your new riches?  We were going around the room.  Travis is going to buy launchables for his kids.  Roland is going to get a handjob.  Troy's going to get a handjob and some bronzer for Sal.  Sal's going to save it for the next time he needs a wax.  And Eric says he's going to use it for his mortgage, but he's going to go to the Toys  R Us in Times Square.  I'm with Eric because...  You're going to the Toys R Us in Times Square?  No, meaning what Eric's describing, he seems to have an amount that is substantial. 
[03:51:30]  And the same goes here.  So mine goes towards bills.  Bills?  Yeah, I'm not going to get a fucking wax.  What is that, $100?  Right.  You're not going to do that.  Mortgage payment.  Car payment.  So you're going to look at when Opie comes in tomorrow, will you sing bills, bills, bills  to him?  Can you pay my bills?  You're going to give him a hug and a kiss?  If he lets me, but he doesn't let me.  I try.  Well, Marge, we're not saying goodbye to the gay until the end of the show tomorrow.  So get your kisses in while you still can. 
[03:52:00]  We'll be ready.  Besos.  Muchos besos.  Besos.  That's Spanish for kisses.  Oh.  You understand.  I do now.  So that's why Marge is always saying this.  All right.  I'm going to put a vote.  Leave this up to the room.  Luke in Massachusetts is on the phone.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to leave it up to the room as to whether or not I pick up his call.  He called in on Sunday.  He calls in a lot.  We went over this on Friday.  He has said unkind things about me on Facebook.  My pal Eric dug that up for me.  I'm going to go around the room. 
[03:52:30]  Mars, do we take Luke's call?  No, man.  Because Sal's a shit, man.  He put up his fish there.  That's right.  He got his fucking dick and balls waxed.  And taint.  And taint.  And motherfucking asshole.  And around the nipples.  I mean, this guy was all hardcore.  Travis?  No.  Why?  I'm just tired of him.  You don't like him rolling?  No, because Sal's a piece of shit.  Wait, wait, wait.  Okay.  The reason doesn't necessarily make sense.  I mean, he's the shit.  Oh, well.  Just a slip of the tongue. 
[03:53:00]  Sal, I'll give you a vote.  I think it's obvious what mine would be.  What is it?  No.  And why is that?  Because he's fatiguing.  He's fatiguing.  He's very fatiguing.  That's a good word.  Yeah.  Is that how you feel about him?  You're just like, uh.  Eric?  No.  Why?  Because when he was here, he kept getting up and wandering around.  It was really bugging me.  Eric always has the best reasons for that.  That's enough.  He kept wandering around.  You're like, what the fuck is his business?  Well, Luke just hung up.  Oh.  He figured, oh, I wasn't going to pick him up.  Did he hear all that? 
[03:53:30]  Yeah.  Oh.  Should have picked up.  He got voted.  Why would he have voted no?  I know.  You voted no?  Yeah.  And then you said Sal's a piece of shit?  Yeah.  Diane.  What's up, Diane?  Hi, Sam.  How are you, honey?  Oh, I'm good.  How are you, Diane?  I'm good.  I love that voice of yours.  You sound very sexy today, Diane.  Dirty Diana.  How about I call you Dirty Diana?  I'm Jimmy Lover.  You're what?  Jimmy Lover.  Who's that?  I'm Hal's look.  Oh, okay.  Mmm. 
[03:54:00]  I know.  Hot and sexy, right?  Okay.  So what do you got, Diane?  I have a question for you.  Was there one honest guy that did not run to cash a check?  I don't think so.  I think, I mean, I know, the only reason I haven't cashed the check yet is because I have  to do this on the air, like he gave it to me on the air.  Roland did it through his phone.  It's already in his checking account.  Now, how fucked up is that?  Well, look.  What about Opie?  You know Opie.  You listen to the show a lot, Diane. 
[03:54:30]  Absolutely.  What about Opie would make you think, ah, I just cash it whenever.  Opie's not the type of guy that would give me a check and then just watch it not be cashable?  I guess he is.  He'd just give you a dead bank account.  He's a cash.  I know I'm going to have to give him my back.  Uh-oh.  What if that happened, Mars?  What happens?  What if it's a dead bank account?  It's impossible because I went to the city bank.  Because they ain't going to find me.  That's why it's impossible.  They checked the account.  That was my question.  And who's the one honest person that did not run to the bank? 
[03:55:00]  I didn't run to the bank.  Why is it being honest if you didn't run to the bank?  Thank you, Eric.  I don't know.  It's in their brown jeans.  I'm sorry.  I don't understand the question.  I'm down with Diane.  Josh in Boston.  I don't know what she's talking about.  Josh in Boston.  Hey, Sam, I know how we can say goodbye to the gay.  Well, I know Boston, you know, you guys are a very accepting city.  You have always welcomed gays, minorities, everyone with open arms.  So if there's anybody we're going to go to, it's you, Josh.  How does Sal say goodbye to the gay? 
[03:55:30]  We shall have Sal get fucking plowed up the ass.  Okay.  All right.  It's a good idea.  Josh, I like it.  Sal, for the show, to say goodbye to gay, will you get plowed up the ass?  I'm going to have to decline that one.  That's a yes.  That's a yes.  By Mars.  Mars, will you plow Sal up the ass for us?  For the show.  No, we're not.  For the show, Mars.  It's not gay because you're pitching.  You know what I mean?  It depends if Opia writes another check. 
[03:56:00]  How much of a check?  It's good to know that Mars can be bought.  How much of a check would Opia have to write for you to fuck Sal in the ass?  More than six zeros.  More than six zeros?  Yeah.  You're talking about a million dollars.  Yeah.  But a million dollars is six zeros.  That's true.  But, you know, more than that.  So ten million dollars to fuck Sal in the ass.  Yeah, because I'm not gay, you know?  I don't think Mars did all the math.  I think he would have done it for a million and forgot that the first number is not zero.  No, I wouldn't do it for a million.  All right.  Will you do it for 18 zeros? 
[03:56:30]  No.  I need a one in front of those zeros.  Something in front of them.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Well, you know, there is a way you can save money.  How is that, Sam?  Everybody's talking about it.  You've seen it?  The Dollar Shave Club video.  It's gone viral.  Millions of views on this thing, and it's hilarious.  It's hysterical.  Everybody here is quoting lines from it.  Just the other day, Travis was like, oh, I'm shaving.  It's me from the video.  I'm like, oh, Travis.  You got a million of them.  Spoiler alert.  Look for the guy in the bear suit and the toddler shaving a guy's head.  So here's what it's all about. 
[03:57:00]  The Dollar Shave Club is giving you this.  Everyone buys razor blades, okay?  You know you got to do it.  Except for Sal.  He's all waxed up.  But everybody else buys razor blades.  Well, brand name razor companies, they nail you.  Just like we're going to do to Sal.  Nail them from behind.  They build up, you know, they have 10 blades, a vibrating handle, a built-in back scratcher.  It's all this bullshit that you don't even need, and you end up paying up the wazoo for it. 
[03:57:30]  Well, Dollar Shave Club says this.  Stop overpaying for shave technology that you just don't need.  All us guys want is a great shave without shelling out 20 bucks month after month.  Dollar Shave Club is genius.  You'd be crazy not to do this.  You send them a couple bucks, then they deliver you great quality razor blades every month right to your door.  No more digging through the trash for that old blade that zombied out your face yesterday.  Go to DollarShaveClub.com, watch the video, and laugh hard. 
[03:58:00]  That's DollarShaveClub.com.  DollarShaveClub.com.  Sam, can I say something real quick?  The other day, right after I got my waxing, I think you were there.  Oh, I was there.  Mars comes up to me, and he goes, dude, you've got to go get your ass licked right tonight.  What's wrong with that?  I mean, I guess it's good advice.  It's a new experience.  It is.  It would feel wonderful, man.  I'm not really into that sort of thing.  And he goes, oh, man, when you get my age, you've got to get into all sorts of crazy shit.  Because you've experienced it all.  You need new experiences. 
[03:58:30]  Yeah, you get your salad tossed.  Why not?  You do get your salad tossed.  Why not?  Men, women?  No, just the wifey.  Jess, your wife does, she doesn't mind tossing your salad every now and then.  Well, she might be talking about it in the air, so.  We don't know who she is.  Let me cut that out.  Tell her not even worry about it.  Don't even worry about it, honey bunch.  Have you ever had your asshole waxed?  No.  That shit looks like it hurts.  Yeah, dude.  It sounded like it hurt, too.  Wow.  Did it hurt, Sal?  Oh, yeah.  Did the asshole itself hurt a lot?  Yeah, but like I said, the worst is the top puke, like the fupa area, man. 
[03:59:00]  You jumped, man, when she did the shaft.  Oh, yeah.  Dude, you fucking...  Can you imagine getting your shaft waxed?  You don't even consider that, do you?  No.  So you only know what it's like to have your asshole eaten with a regular hairy asshole.  Right.  You can only imagine the pleasure that one would feel.  Yeah.  I would love to be, I mean, in your shoes if I had to go through that, but I wouldn't put myself in that predicament.  Did you get somebody to lick your asshole?  No, I didn't.  Did you want me to put in a call to go, go harder? 
[03:59:30]  The gay office tomorrow.  He'll be here tomorrow, right?  So...  Greg in Michigan.  Hey, Sam.  I just wanted to let Mars know that it's okay to plow Sal in the ass because if he sticks his dick in Sal's ass, that just makes Sal gay and him curious.  Yeah.  I mean, you're just curious.  You're just like, oh, what would it be like to...  Like, I just want to fuck an asshole, you know?  Sound advice.  And Sal is a feminine dude.  He's not a masculine guy.  Not with all that hair on his face. 
[04:00:00]  Yeah, but you know what?  You just touch his body.  Oh, yeah.  He's very feminine to the touch.  Very soft and smooth.  John in Wyoming.  All right.  I got it.  I got it.  I'm sorry.  I was stuttering.  It's all right.  It's nerve-wracking.  You're on the phone with Sam Roberts, professional broadcaster.  The great Sam Roberts.  That's right.  Okay.  Now, if Sal can say no to gay and apologize to Travis at the same time by blowing him tomorrow  in the studio.  What if you do that?  I'm sorry.  What if we, in order to say goodbye to gay and to say, I'm sorry to Travis, you give him 
[04:00:30]  a nice blowjob?  Would you do that for him?  He's down for it.  He's a closeted homosexual himself.  Travis, I'm talking about.  I don't want to blow Travis.  Why not?  I just, I don't, I'm not gay, so.  Oh, so he's good enough for you to slap your waxed pubes on his head, but you won't blow  the poor guy.  Yeah.  We've only got one more day for this gayness.  Yeah.  That's pretty dirty, Sal.  Yeah, it is dirty.  It was pretty nasty, yeah.  No, it's dirty that you did that to him and you won't, you know, give him something nice 
[04:01:00]  in return.  I won't return the favor.  He was pretty pissed, man.  Oh, yeah.  Woo.  He was heated.  He was heated.  He was yelling at you, dude.  On air.  Really, dude?  And it wasn't like character yelling.  No.  Like, it wasn't like, oh, let's get in an on-air fight.  No.  He wanted nothing to do with you.  Yeah, Eric just pulled it.  Let's listen.  This was after Sal slapped his pubes on Travis's head.  Travis has not spoken to him since.  Is that right?  Yeah.  Wow.  Here it is.  That's the...  He's stuck out on Travis's head. 
[04:01:30]  Are you fucking kidding me?  He's stuck out on Travis's head.  I'm holding the fucking mic, you asshole.  Oh, my God.  He's stuck out on Travis's head.  You're shitting me, right?  Travis is not happy.  Travis is not happy.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  You're fucking shitting me, right?  Out of everyone in this fucking room.  Out of everyone in this fucking room, you put it on my fucking head?  Oh, my God.  Are you fucking kidding me?  Oh, my God.  It's relaxing, dude.  I'm sorry, Travis.  You're fucking kidding me, right? 
[04:02:00]  It's on my head?  It's not off now.  I took it off.  Yeah, it's just mostly...  Oh.  Fucking asshole.  You lost the only person who would defend you here.  Oh!  Nice.  That's got to be embarrassing with your penis hanging out.  That totally made up for it, Troy's line.  He got a line of the day, right?  Yeah, he made up for it for you and Troy, maybe.  He didn't make up for it for Travis.  We never even hear that side of Travis on the air.  Yes.  He doesn't get mad like that.  Yeah.  You brought it out in him.  Yep.  But you hear Sal pussy out real quick. 
[04:02:30]  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  And credit to Sal.  He did the right thing.  You know, the dude was pissed, you know, right away.  Yo, I apologize, man, because, you know, this guy, he's got your future in your hand, too.  I'm sorry that I was getting, like, made fun of and I reacted through the entire time, you know.  So you're saying you're not sorry?  No, of course I'm sorry.  Why are you sorry?  If you're getting made fun of...  If someone did it to me, I probably would have done something worse than what Travis did to me.  What did he do, just stop talking to you?  What?  What did he do, just stop talking to you? 
[04:03:00]  Oh, yeah, and he yelled at me on air, yeah.  Humiliated you is what he did.  Sam, my humiliation started at nine when fucking...  Oh, I thought you were going to say at birth.  Yeah, that too.  Yeah.  But I think it didn't help matters when we all burst out laughing and shit as soon as he did it.  It's embarrassing for Travis.  Yes, it is.  It was very embarrassing.  He was the butt of the joke and the guy who concocted this joke was the naked feminine guy on the table.  With his legs up.  With his legs up.  With his fucking tiny dick out, yeah.  Yeah.  Mark that.  With Nicole in the other room laughing at him. 
[04:03:30]  Can you believe that?  Mars, if you were in that position, can you believe somebody like Nicole coming in here?  And not you now.  You as like a young guy.  Like you in your early 20s.  And someone like Nicole comes in here, experienced, sexual Nicole, is looking at you going,  Aha, look at that asshole.  No, literally.  Nope.  Whew.  I have nothing to fear now.  Like, everyone's seen me naked.  You've been fully exposed.  Nicole's seen my dick.  Yes, she has.  She's seen, you know, it's fun.  And asshole.  And everything. 
[04:04:00]  And we've heard of your sex life.  Yeah, everyone knows everything about that.  Can't come with girls.  No, you've been fully exposed.  There's nothing to hide.  It's a nice place to be in, isn't it?  Just come out the closet.  No, I'm not gay, though.  He'll get there.  He'll get there.  Tony.  Hey, Prime Time.  Yeah, Prime Time, Sam Roberts.  What is with all the callers just stuttering today?  They're nervous.  I'm here.  It's Sam Roberts.  Prime Time, Sam Roberts.  You're a big celebrity.  I love you, Sam Roberts.  Thank you so much, Tony.  It's actually Addy.  They said my name wrong.  Yeah, it doesn't surprise us with our phone screeners.  Hey, so I'm in this contest for MLB.com. 
[04:04:30]  It ends tomorrow, and I need some votes.  It's voteforaddy84.com.  If you could do that for me, you'd be the man.  Okay, what did we, huh?  Vote for who?  Vote for addy84.com.  I don't know why.  Okay, addy84.  Vote for addy84.com, and that's all?  Yes, sir, and you just vote as many times as you want  and get me to win MLB Fan Cave.  Okay.  I hope you win MLB Fan Cave.  Oh, you're the man.  Thank you, Sam Roberts.  I love you.  All right, buddy.  Larry.  Hollywood, Prime Time, Sammy, Sweetheart, 
[04:05:00]  the F.N. Roberts Professional Broadcaster.  How are you?  Without a stutter, Larry comes through.  Well, why would I stutter?  I went through speech therapy as a child.  I really wanted to...  Go on.  I did.  It's really, you know, sorry.  I'm short.  Well, I really wanted to come to Mars Defense.  People have been defaming Mars a little bit,  trying to demean Mars.  I thought Mars was the test case  to find out if the checks were any good  and Mars was performing a heroic act 
[04:05:30]  because he was risking arrest for passing bad paper.  Right.  He stepped up for the whole show,  the whole staff, everybody who got their checks,  and if it had been counterfeit,  I mean, Mars would have been in jail.  He is a Puerto Rican gentleman.  He would have been in jail.  Clearly questioning him at the bank.  I mean, he stood up.  He stood tall.  Mars is a man, motherfucker.  Mars is a man.  Thank you, Larry.  Thank you, Larry.  Doesn't it feel good when Larry compliments you?  It feels nice.  Yeah, Larry's cool.  What are you doing?  Your wife tosses your salad all year long. 
[04:06:00]  What are you doing for Valentine's Day?  You got plans?  Dude, I'm in a doghouse right now,  so I got to come up with something.  Why are you in the doghouse?  I was lazy all weekend,  and I was really lazy all weekend.  Meaning like she was asking you to do stuff  and you didn't get it done?  Meaning I didn't even take a shower.  I didn't want to do shit.  So she didn't toss her salad this weekend.  Right.  I hope not.  And that's from the anger.  I didn't provide my husband duties.  She's annoyed with you  because you let the house get messed up.  You didn't shower. 
[04:06:30]  You just looked like a...  I didn't say anything about the house being messed up.  I was just being lazy.  I shoveled my snow and went inside  and got lazy.  Just laid in your own filth.  That's it.  You know what you can do.  You know it's Thursday, right?  I know.  So give me some ideas, Sam.  Well, Mars is obviously...  He's in the doghouse.  He has no gift.  You can't screw up Valentine's Day  like you've screwed up the rest of your life so far.  This is your time to make it up, Mars.
