<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with chaotic banter, including discussion of a malfunctioning "Stinky Cam" and the upcoming "What the Hell Is That?" segment, which featured individuals with unusual medical conditions, including one described as a "piece of ass."  The hosts skeptically discussed Geraldo Rivera's claim of narrowly escaping a sniper in Afghanistan, suggesting it might be fabricated.  A tribute to hospitalized employee Earl, who reacted negatively to it, was mentioned. A doctor who also appeared on "Temptation Island" called in, leading to sexually explicit conversation about her experiences on the show and with patients.  Listener calls covered Johnny Walker's capture and the "FU line" segment.  The show then introduced "Rock and Roll Tommy," a homeless man with 500 CDs, a history of drug use, and legal troubles, as a participant in the upcoming "Homeless Shopping Spree."  His living situation and struggles were discussed.

The "What the Hell Is That?" segment featured numerous callers with bizarre medical issues.  Rock and Roll Tommy called again, confirming his participation in the "Homeless Shopping Spree," which would also include returning participants Ziggy and Tippi Tom.  Callers described a guest who sweats only on one side of his face depending on activity, someone who could regurgitate Big Mac components on demand (offered Patriots tickets), and introduced the slang term "the ninja" for an STI.  Several in-studio medical "cases" followed: Danielle Clark with abnormally large breasts and a supernumerary nipple; Mike with a scrotal growth (a "skin tag") prompting jokes about removal; Nicky whose fianc√©e had an odoriferous vaginal discharge; Mike with hand warts; and John from Queens with galactorrhea leaking from his chest.  A dermatologist called in to offer free removal of Mike's scrotal growth.  The segment concluded introducing Sandy Kane, whose condition remained a mystery, with promises of further "What the Hell Is That?" segments, and numerous "FU Friday" calls.

A "Stinky Cam" segment showcased a caller, "Stinky," with a milky, yellowish, foul-smelling discharge, with speculation about marijuana use as a cause.  This led to a series of calls describing various medical issues, all examined by on-site doctors.  These included a man with a golf ball-sized growth on his inner thigh, a caller with Terrian's Corneal Dystrophy (rotting corneas), and a man with a jaw lump.  The final caller, Sandy Kane, a former stripper with a public access show, revealed a large perianal genital wart and a hemorrhoid, causing strong reactions.  The hosts ended the "medical" portion early due to discomfort, and staff member Ben left early due to a lost bet.  The segment included band plugs and references to other show segments, and was highly vulgar and graphic.

Comedian Sandy Kane, already introduced in the previous segment, was a guest, with the focus on a genital growth and the ensuing crude jokes and sexually explicit comments about her anatomy.  Several doctors offered medical opinions, though Sandy distrusted them and refused treatment.  She performed a song, "My Boyfriend's Black," with offensive lyrics about Black celebrities including O.J. Simpson and Mike Tyson.  Hosts and callers used highly offensive and vulgar language.  Listener calls shared reactions and offered crude commentary.  The segment concluded with the hosts expressing disgust and a "What Did We Learn?" segment featuring caller feedback. Tim Norton was also in the studio.

[00:00:00]  Marijuana is the bomb.  Yes, but no.  See, see, see, see, see.  No, my brother.  Can't get it right now. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah.  Cancel your appointment.  Yes, yes, yes.  Six-eyed trucks are going to put the hot dog in the bun.  Hey, everybody, we're all going to get laid.  Puck it up and kiss my fast.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  Oh, you got me.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, it's Friday. 
[00:01:00]  Yes.  So damn excited.  What are you, gay?  Oh, no.  What?  Oh, no.  You're the ugliest stripper I've ever seen in my life.  My second job, though.  No.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else.  Wow, I need a drink.  All right, relax.  Beer on the way.  Anywhere else.  866-2774.  Wow.  Oh, it's all going. 
[00:01:30]  866-2774.  Wow.  Wow.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  I've been here for seven years.  How about a nice bucket of eggs?  How about the bug?  The bug.  Oh, jeez.  I don't want to get the eggs, fellas.  All right, Butters.  Who does, Butters?  All Butters show next South Park, by the way. 
[00:02:00]  Calling it the most buttery episode ever.  It's about time.  I know.  They should have done the spin-off already.  He's a stand-alone character, Butters.  Yes, he is.  It looks like you're just supposed to roll it over your wieners.  All right, well, a couple things right off the bat.  Oh, jeez.  I don't want to get the throats, fellas.  The Stinky Cam is alive.  It is.  The Stinky Cam lives.  What happened?  Maybe we should have tested it on a limited basis. 
[00:02:30]  How did we get the Stinky Cam working again?  I don't know.  I don't know who controls it.  I don't know if it's on right now, so I just don't know.  Just proven, once again, that we are the stupidest radio hosts in America.  Yeah.  We had that hot piece of ass in here yesterday, Terry Weigel.  And no one saw her.  No one saw her.  But we made sure the Stinky Cam worked for today's program when we do What the Hell Is That?  Could be the most disgusting program you've ever heard.  I think. 
[00:03:00]  I think.  We have a bunch of people coming in with physical anomalies.  And they're going to have them checked out by doctors.  So what the hell is that?  You know, people go through their whole lives and they're looking at something and they go,  what?  She says, what the hell is that?  I want to go to a doctor.  And they could come to our show.  I hear one of the doctors, though, is a piece of A.  What's his name, Opie?  Ha ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha! 
[00:03:30]  Ha ha ha ha!  But we're waiting for Sidney Cain to arrive because we will diagnose what the hell Twato is finally.  She inspired the whole thing.  Really.  Yes.  When you think about it.  She came in.  She's got this growth that we have affectionately named Twato.  Uh, and we don't know what it is.  There are, there are, uh, uh, uh, people have ideas what it could be.  Could be a genital wart. 
[00:04:00]  Could be, um, uh, uh, keloid scarring.  People have been, uh, saying.  That, that's the odds on favorite that it's a keloid scar.  Cause he's done, I ain't got it from saving it.  Ha ha ha ha ha!  I, I, I, I, I...  Can I ask, what is, what is a keloid scar?  I don't know.  It, uh, yeah, I don't know.  You nick yourself and then it just goes, uh...  It goes crazy!  It goes crazy and starts growing and stuff.  I don't know!  She's got Rocky Dennis' head there.  That's what it looks like.  That's what it looks like. 
[00:04:30]  Rocky Dennis!  My mom said I look like a cowardly lion from the Wizard of Oz.  Thank God you're blind, bitch.  Nice!  Poor little Twatto pulling those little pins out of the map.  Ha ha ha!  He's not going on his trip with his buddy.  Ha ha ha!  Cause he's gonna die.  Hey, uh, I did, I saw that movie recently.  Mask, mask.  And, um, that scene at the camp when the girls, uh, Laura Dern's parents come to pick her up  and she goes, I want you to meet Rocky! 
[00:05:00]  And she's blind, you know, she can't see this guy, he's just a monster.  Wait, wait, wait, Laura Dern was in that movie?  Yeah, she was, uh, the blind girl.  No kidding.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  And, uh, the parents are standing there and when Rocky comes running over and the parents  turn around, oh, let's see Rocky, the one you've been talking so much about.  Ah!  Oh my God.  They'll look at him and say, hello, welcome, get in the car, time to go.  Ha ha ha!  Great, the sensitivity.  All right.  Wonderful movie.  And you still haven't answered my question, though.  How do we get the stinky cam working? 
[00:05:30]  I don't know.  What, is it on that computer now?  It's on this computer.  Oh boy.  Uh-oh.  I've got to get it linked into mine.  I'm in control of multimedia.  So when does this freeze up?  Um, he just got it installed today.  Uh-oh.  He said we can turn it on and off from, uh, this laptop here.  And as soon as, as soon as he gets more time, he's going to make it so you can control.  So, uh, when is it going to be?  Is it online right now?  It's on now.  Let me, let me take a look.  Yeah, it's on.  It's on.  It's showing the doors.  People come and go.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  You can go to, uh, opandanthony.com to get to it, I believe.  Yeah.  Stinky cam. 
[00:06:00]  Ooh, the warning on there.  I like that.  You've got to be 18.  There it is.  There's a picture of a door.  Um, there it is.  Prove that it's working.  Norton stay there.  No, it is.  Image, image reloads, uh, get a, get a picture of, uh, Norton's melon there.  Boy, they don't have a quick reload time, do they?  No.  Oh, well.  And it's still the door.  Still the door?  Yeah.  I sure hope it works.  There it is.  It will be Norton now.  Oh, you got, you got an updated Norton picture?  There's Norton.  Oh, my God. 
[00:06:30]  Wow, you do look like a lesbian, dude.  If I didn't know you, man.  Where is it?  There he is.  You're off, you're frightful when you don't smile.  Is that out of focus or is that just the way he looks?  Now it's your coffee.  Now there's your Starbucks.  Okay, this is really boring for most people.  Well, no, this is something that has been, uh, in the making for quite a while.  We will, uh, we will be able to now bring you some still pictures at an update rate of  about, uh, 10, uh, seconds per picture.  All right.  There you go.  So there you have it.  Uh, Anthony, before we, uh, get started with the, what the hell is that festivities today? 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Uh, you wanted to, to talk about Geraldo really fast.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We, why wait?  Because you're just ranting in the back office.  We mentioned a story yesterday where, uh, uh, in Fox News is making a big deal of this.  Uh, Giambi going to the Yankees?  Yes.  Oops.  Oops.  I know.  Oops.  Oops.  Oops.  A little premature.  Well, we're not going.  He's not going.  Well, it's not a done deal.  Well, it's not in stone yet.  We reported, uh, as a done deal yesterday because we wanted to, you know, be the first 
[00:07:30]  to do it.  You know what happened?  You know what happened?  Steinbrenner heard Norton's rant and said, I'm going to back off on this a little.  The new whiny Steinbrenner.  Yeah, I know the Mets got justice.  Whatever.  Did they?  Yeah.  There you go.  We traded him.  Go ahead, Anthony.  Geraldo.  So, anyway, uh, big story yesterday was, um, how Geraldo ducked out of the way of a  sniper's bullet and, uh, the, the, uh, Taliban almost killed Geraldo Rivera. 
[00:08:00]  He's there with Fox News is there.  Then they got to say this and I know it was him that put it in this contract or something.  This guy's the most pompous buffoon.  He probably said, every time you go to me, you must say, you are now going to, uh, Tora  Bora with war correspondent, Geraldo Rivera.  He wants to be war correspondent, Geraldo Rivera.  So, uh, uh, yesterday we talked about how the sniper almost, uh, hit him.  I finally saw the clip last night. 
[00:08:30]  There's Geraldo.  He's, uh, he's, uh, kind of crouching down.  He's, uh, in the desert, obviously.  He has a microphone and he's doing what they call a wraparound.  Kind of like, um, talking about how he's going to be going out the next day with these, uh,  Alliance, uh, soldiers.  He goes, and, uh, we will be going to a mountain range that, uh, the Taliban have been fleeing.  And then all of a sudden, I heard no shot.  I heard nothing.  The camera guy wiggles the camera a lot.  And Geraldo gets even lower on the ground, but continues doing his wraparound and doesn't move. 
[00:09:00]  If, if you heard, uh, he goes, and I heard a sound that many veterans can recognize.  The bullet winging inches from your head.  Inches?  Inches from his head.  He said this.  He said this.  Meanwhile, he cramps down a little lower.  The camera guy kept the shot on him.  And he finished his wraparound with, uh, just a little gap.  He's like, and we will, tomorrow we will be going into some caves where we will be. 
[00:09:30]  That was it.  Dude, if a sniper's bullet just missed your head by inches, would you not take the camera?  The cameraman is not continuing to film.  The cameraman not filming you.  No way.  Geraldo not continuing to do his little wraparound.  He is seeking cover.  You take cover.  You know what?  Didn't happen.  I'm saying it right now.  Geraldo planned with his camera guy.  You know sensationalist Geraldo. 
[00:10:00]  He told the camera guy, when I hit this word in my speech, you listen for it.  And you shake the camera.  I'm going to get down, but continue filming me.  And we'll say that a bullet nearly missed me.  This is going to be great.  I don't believe that he, a bullet came close to him.  I didn't hear it.  Nothing.  Then later on in the broadcast, because now I'm just trapped.  I have to watch.  Uh, he, he said, they cut into a program.  Like they go, oh, wait a minute.  Wait, we got to go to Geraldo, our war correspondent.  Live from Afghanistan. 
[00:10:30]  He's going, he, he, the, the camera shows a B-52.  The contrail's coming off the wings.  He goes, B-52's now flying over our position.  Uh, within minutes you will see huge explosions in the mountain chain across this valley.  Keep the camera over there.  These B-52's weeding out some of the Taliban that are here.  Any minute now you're going to see giant explosions coming from this, uh, mountain chain.  Any minute now.  It's going to happen.  They're at very high altitude.  Was he live at this point?  Live, dude.  Live. 
[00:11:00]  Oh.  It went on and on.  And then he goes, uh, sometimes they don't drop their bombs if we're a little too close to the position.  Well, um, they should have exploded by now.  Back to you.  Nothing.  Good.  It was Al Capone's vault all over again.  And I'm, and I'm an ass.  I'm caught up in the whole thing.  I'm sitting there going, oh my God, I'm going to see bombs.  Geraldo, you rule.  And he jacked me again.  I saw nothing. 
[00:11:30]  It was Al Capone's vault.  I was captivated.  I'm like, oh, they're breaking in.  They're going to Geraldo.  What happened?  B-52's.  I see him.  Okay.  Bombs are dropping, Geraldo.  All right, I'm with you.  I'm watching.  And watching.  And watching.  Nothing.  Nothing.  He is the most sensationalist, uh, I, I, I, for a better word, journalist.  I, I can't call him a journalist, but, you know, I can't think of a better word right now.  The guy is making up stuff over there.  He is making up stuff. 
[00:12:00]  I don't care.  It's entertaining.  I like watching the goofy Geraldo dodging fake bullets.  But it's, it's, it's.  He is the furthest thing from a legitimate journalist.  War correspondent.  So, uh, maybe watch him.  I'm probably giving him a plug.  You're going to want to watch him now.  All right.  There you have it.  What an ass.  So my F you first one to Geraldo.  That's right.  It is F you Friday.  So, uh, Mule, Amol.  Hey, what's up, boy, man?  What's up?  What's up?  Not much.  Hey, you saw Smackdown last night?  I missed Smackdown, but I got the report that, that the Vince thing was, uh, beyond hilarious. 
[00:12:30]  Yes, it was the best thing you can ever.  And Vince had to, uh, kiss the Rock's butt.  Yes.  And, uh, right at the moment that, uh, Vince was supposed to kiss the Rock's butt, uh, basically  the Rock said that, uh, Vince wasn't worthy.  And then he brought out Rikishi.  Ah.  So, Vince had to kiss Rikishi's ass last night.  Ah.  I heard it was great.  It was great.  Oh, last thing.  Thank you, rules.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye. 
[00:13:00]  I missed it because I went to see Louis Black at Caroline's The Man Killed Last Night.  How is Louis?  Good?  Really good.  He's going to be playing tonight, Saturday, and Sunday.  If you have no plans, that's something you can certainly do and, uh, and enjoy, man.  He's, he's, all new material, too.  Well, a life is his, uh, material, which is great, you know?  The guy just gets out there.  Did he do a lot of stuff on, uh, airport security?  The situation.  His airport security stuff.  Yeah.  Just top notch.  Top notch.  Top notch.  Uncle John.  Hey, guys.  What's happening? 
[00:13:30]  What's going on, Uncle John?  Hey, I want to be a character.  I want to be, I don't answer to my name guy.  You want to be, I don't answer to my name guy?  Yeah, I'll be, I'll be Ted, and you'll call me Ed, and I won't answer you.  That's not a bad idea.  Yeah, but like, I'll be sitting here talking, saying, oh, yeah, I'm on hold, but I'll be  going to answer you.  Hey, listen to this fool.  They're calling this guy Ed.  You don't answer him.  Right.  You can not scream it at me, and I'll say, hey, my name's Ted.  I like it.  Cool.  Thank you, Uncle John.  All right, man.  All right, bye.  Bye. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, I've got to restart over here.  All right, now, where's Rick?  We've got to see where we are.  I know the doctors are arriving.  Some of the people are arriving.  Yeah.  What do we got outside so far, Ben?  You know?  I heard Stinky doing the confirmation calls last night.  Opie is in the office calling up all the people.  Hi.  You said you were going to come down for what's that, to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi.  Hi, it's Garrett Stinky.  Well, he used to say Stinky.  I'm like, dude, don't say that, because, like, parents are answering. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, it's Garrett Stinky.  He left a lot of messages on machines is pretty much what he was getting.  I don't think you got any live people on the phone, did you?  No, a few.  Yeah.  Well, what do we got outside so far?  All the doctors are here, which is amazing.  All doctors, no people yet, as far as people that need to be diagnosed?  At least they're not down here.  They might be upstairs getting checked out with Steve.  All right, this better not be Britney Spears all over again.  I don't want to have to resort to us telling doctors about our own problems. 
[00:15:00]  And we have many.  Must be nice, though, to have doctors waiting in your waiting room.  Hub, blah, hub, blah.  Dan, what's going on?  Guffaw.  Hey, guys, just wanted to congratulate you on your Cracker Jack show prep,  making sure the Stinky can was ready at the crack of 308.  Isn't that great?  Sure.  Gosh almighty, next thing you know, you're going to be ready at 255.  Slow down.  We're show prepping more lately.  Thank you.  Hey, one of the things.  Yes, Dan?  Sounds like Geraldo sent the perception on assistance.  It's the same as Opie from the World Trade Center. 
[00:15:30]  You guys suck.  Missed by inches, and by inches I mean miles.  Lisa, what's going on?  What about Girl?  I thought you guys were going to do the tribute.  We did the tribute.  Did you hear it yesterday?  No, well, that's the thing.  I missed it yesterday.  Oh, okay.  So you guys promised it early in the show.  It's 3.20.  Let's go.  You know, Lisa, we'll do it right here.  How's that sound?  That sounds awesome.  Thanks.  I'm going to hang up on you so we can set it up, okay?  Okay.  All right.  Thank you, Lisa, for reminding us.  No problem.  Yes, Anthony.  Steve from FoundryMusic.com put together the Black Earl tribute. 
[00:16:00]  Yes, it is haunting.  Take off on Brian's song, basically.  You know the story?  Our own Earl, who does nothing around here.  Token black guy.  He doesn't really do much, right?  Yeah.  He'll admit that.  But we like the guy.  Right.  We ride him a little too hard sometimes.  He was in the hospital with bleeding ulcers, almost bled to death.  Have we heard from Earl?  He's out of ICU, I guess.  Is he? 
[00:16:30]  Right?  Out of ICU, but refuses to take any of our phone calls.  Why?  I don't know.  I think he got a little pissed off at the tribute.  How could you get pissed at a tribute?  The tribute getting rave reviews and Earl very, very mad.  It's all about the love.  He called the hotline right after we played it and told Stinky, it's over.  And I just hung up.  That's the last words we have heard from Earl.  It's over.  Playtime is over.  It's over.  Jesus.  He's too much.  And I felt a little guilty because he had a little episode on the show live.  And the next thing you know, he's in ICU with bleeding ulcers and stuff. 
[00:17:00]  Anyway, Steve put this little tribute together.  I hope you enjoy it, okay?  ABC.  And the wonderful world of Disney present an extraordinary production of the story of  Earl Douglas.  Go f*** yourself, okay?  He had survived every format change at WNEW.  I'm the public service director.  But would he survive this tragic ordeal?  Earl, are you okay?  What do you have on your chart? 
[00:17:30]  I have ulcers.  Two of them.  No one knew that a stress-free job could be so deadly.  They took a camera, ran it down my throat, made a wonderful journey through my stomach.  Watch as Earl clings to life in the intensive care unit.  He's not responding.  He's just sitting there kicking his feet.  He looks like he's going to kill somebody.  I guarantee you someone will get injured.  And it won't be me.  No.  With the public file in disarray, the staff of WNEW tries to cope.  Who's going to sit in the back cubicle and do nothing all day? 
[00:18:00]  Who's going to hang these pictures?  Our token black guy.  He's gone.  Who knew Scott Muni would have outlived Earl?  The van showed up for a sticker stop on time.  Wait, Earl's not here?  Hey, look.  CDs.  Watch as Earl faces struggles inside the studio and out. 
[00:18:30]  Earl, I have a question for you.  Is it true that they wanted you to work harder so they're going to do a melanin extraction?  Next question.  Yeah.  If Earl's on the road to recovery, won't he get lost?  Tell me where I'm going.  From ABC television comes the triumphant true story of laziness, mediocrity, virginity, and internal bleeding.  Guess what?  No one cares.  Earl's song.  I love you, Earl Douglas.  Go f**k yourself, okay?  O.P. 
[00:19:00]  Answer me.  Their psychosis is all real.  This is not an act.  Ponderous.  F-ing Ponderous.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Check it out.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's F-U Friday.  Yeah.  We're playing What the Hell is That Today.  All the doctors are here and some of the people have started arriving that want things diagnosed.  Beautiful.  We're helping again.  Again we help.  We have an ex-Playboy model who's now a doctor. 
[00:19:30]  That never happens.  Wow.  She's smoking though.  And she was on Temptation Island, the first one or the second one?  Yeah.  The first one.  The first one?  Yeah.  What is that?  All right.  We'll get her in here, man.  Peter, what's going on?  Yeah, what's up, man?  Hey.  Hey.  What's up? 
[00:20:00]  You tell us.  You're on the radio, bro.  I'm on the radio.  Cool.  I want to know what you guys think about this Johnny Walker dude.  Oh, kill him.  I've been in the Gulf War and if I was over there, I'd give him a 5.56 millimeter enema,  if you know what that is.  Well, let me tell you something.  Yeah, I'm sure he is not being kept in the most comfortable of places.  I'm sure the company that he's around, he'd rather not have around.  It's the United States military, CIA and whatnot. 
[00:20:30]  And then that tape yesterday surfaced of the dead CIA agent, the guy that died in the  prison uprising, actually interrogating this son of a bitch.  And minutes later, the gunfire starts.  And...  I'm calling him this poor misguided fellow.  Hey, Peter, Peter.  I say he gives you that poor deceit.  You guys just go.  Hang up on him.  Oh, I hate people.  You're asking questions and then you can't even answer the question.  Like you're answering it and then he starts talking about something else. 
[00:21:00]  You were still going, weren't you?  But Bush did call him some poor unfortunate fellow.  You know, Bush doesn't want to come out screaming about some 20-year-old, I guess.  You know what I mean?  But I don't care how old this guy is.  You want to go into drugs or get some tattoos or a piercing?  That's one thing.  You start picking up guns and shooting at American soldiers?  That's a little different.  I don't think you should have called him a poor unfortunate fellow.  He's a traitor.  Should be tied to a pole and shot.  Thank you.  All right.  With that, we have...  Look at the hotness in the studio right now. 
[00:21:30]  Hi.  Hello.  How are you?  Good.  Wait, doctors don't wear leather outfits like that?  Well, I don't wear this to work.  I wear this jacket, but I thought I'd, you know, get a little more interesting for...  What kind of doctor are you?  Just your basic general practitioner?  Family practice.  Family practice.  Yeah, it's a specialty, you know, it took three years after med school to do...  I've got to ask you something.  When you get a boy, you know, mid to late teens that come in and they have personal problems,  it is a little weird for them to, you know, pull their pants down and... 
[00:22:00]  Well, they have no choice because I'm allowed to say, you know...  Pull your pants down.  Yeah.  But you know something?  I don't know if it's weird for them or not.  They don't really say anything.  When you're checking for that vernia, turn and cough?  Yeah.  I don't do it that way, though.  No?  How do you do it?  What do you do?  No, I mean...  A couple of drinks?  No, I just don't make them turn.  Wow.  You're not going to cough on me from three feet above?  I had a goddamn German doctor as a pediatrician when I was a kid.  And...  Obviously. 
[00:22:30]  And Dr. Fuchs.  And she would be like, take your pants down!  And it was the most like this big Helga woman, you know?  How old was she?  And...  Oh, she was an older lady?  Especially when you're a kid, she might as well have been a million.  Right.  It didn't matter.  Right, right, right, right.  You know?  But I couldn't imagine walking in and going, oh, my God, this is the doctor.  Now I've got to show my short, prepubescent schlong, too.  You know?  Some of them tried to refuse when I was seeing kids, but...  Yeah.  You know, they really couldn't.  What idiots.  What about the adult men that come in that don't really... 
[00:23:00]  Aren't really shy and they want to show you maybe something they have under their underwear  or something?  It's a little weird.  And only a few times do they ever seem to be too excited.  Oh, really?  Did that happen?  Yeah, and you're just supposed to...  What, do you give it the flick?  Pong!  No, you're just supposed to sort of acknowledge, oh, I guess everything's working okay.  And, you know, not pretend like you don't see it.  You're right.  Hey, want a tug?  Yeah.  You know, something like that.  No, no.  I knew some nurse, and she said sometimes the guys would be aroused when she would come 
[00:23:30]  along, and she wouldn't think twice about it.  She would just take her middle finger and use it to flick, you know, and just go, poink,  and it would go away instantly.  Really?  And she wouldn't talk about it, wouldn't say anything, just go, poink, and then...  And it would go away?  Oh, instantly.  Yeah.  Maybe it was just her.  I don't know.  Well, I hired her for one night.  She wore a nurse's outfit, so...  What?  Maybe I'm speaking out of turn here.  No.  But a very, very nice doctor.  We don't even know her name.  We don't know what she has done in the past. 
[00:24:00]  My name.  Yeah.  My name is Allison.  Uh-huh.  Dr. Allison?  What have I done in the past?  Well, you were on Temptation Island.  I was on Temptation Island once.  You were on Temptation Island.  Why don't I remember that?  I stayed on to the end.  My hair's all, like, curly and messy because we were in the jungle humidity, so...  I'm trying to remember this.  I watched that show religiously.  I stayed on to the end, went on the final dream date in the cave.  You were the cave?  I was the girl in the cave.  Wait, wait, wait.  With Kaya.  Why did you take Kaya, my boyfriend? 
[00:24:30]  That woman.  I need to take my hundred vitamin tells.  She was crazy.  She's absolutely crazy.  That date she went on.  That poor son of a bitch that got stuck with her.  Oh, Dano.  He's my friend.  All I can think about is Kaya.  She was talking around like, uh-uh.  We were huge fans of Temptation Island on the first one.  Yeah.  Because it was just such a mess.  I loved it.  You were the one, like, they were swimming and stuff, and they had a slow-motion shot of you, like...  Hair flipping.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  You were the hottest one. 
[00:25:00]  That was me with the hair flipping.  But I was like, I don't know.  But the lab coat is throwing you off a little bit in the lack of tan.  Nice.  No tan, right.  But, I mean, the body's still there.  Still there.  Wow.  Wow.  That's cool.  She went on the dream date with Kaya in the cave.  And I never forget about it.  That sounds like Lisa Orban.  She has herself convinced that he never kissed anyone there.  And it was funny, because on the reunion show, they show, as she's saying that, in the background  over her shoulder, him kissing, like, two different girls, you know.  And she's like, well, he was a perfect gentleman.  Oh, God. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, God.  Well, it's a perfect...  What about you?  Did he try anything?  Did he make any moves?  Yeah.  Was he really looking to close the deal?  Well, I won't say exactly what happened in the cave.  No.  But they really did take the cameras away for 12 hours.  They did?  Yeah.  And people think, like, we're making that up or stupid, because you see footage of it.  Well, they had them on us when we got there.  And then when we were there, they took them away.  And then we were freaking out, like, all right, where do they have them hidden?  Like, we were, like, tearing apart, like, the whole canopy we had.  Oh, really?  Now, why would you be doing this?  We wanted to know if we were on camera. 
[00:26:00]  A little privacy?  Yeah.  Was there anything more than kissing?  Yes.  There was something a little more than kissing.  I won't say.  Oh, look at you.  Because you go from kissing, the next thing is, you know, maybe some hand action.  I don't know.  You can't say, but would you have heard this?  Norton, you are despicable.  The woman's a doctor.  We drank some champagne.  I don't know.  Yeah, see, very good.  You know what you mean?  Very good.  The white foamy stuff? 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  I don't know.  How many caves were being explored?  Oh, God.  You are despicable.  There were stalagmites, too.  Big, stalagmites.  Well, you're a beautiful lady.  You also were in Playboy?  In 1995, in the Women of the Ivy League issue.  I love those issues.  The college girl issues.  I was in med school, so they didn't love it.  God damn, where is that?  So you're a real Ivy League girl?  Because I always thought that was fake.  Yeah, I was in med school at Penn at the time.  And I went to Penn State for college, so I've been to, like, both. 
[00:27:00]  Hey, anybody, instantly give us that picture on the internet.  It's on my old website.  People are so resourceful.  Oh, it's not up on your website now?  It's not on the new one.  The new one's, like, sort of the professional one.  It's on the old one.  It is?  Is that address still there?  Yeah, I can.  Oh, write it down.  It's too complicated.  Just write it down.  Don't give it out, because our listeners have to wait.  Ha, ha.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow, wait.  Write this down.  Isn't this great?  This is great.  She's liking everything.  She's a professional woman. 
[00:27:30]  She was on Temptation Island.  She had a little more than just kissing.  She was definitely the hottest girl on Temptation Island, and Kaya was stupid to go back to that  whining bitch and blow you off.  Oh, yeah.  And, you know, he wanted to, they all wanted to stay with their girlfriends.  They didn't want to look bad, because they wanted to go into entertainment.  Right.  And they would have looked totally scuzzy to be like, oh.  Are all the couples still together?  Do you know offhand?  Well, Kaya and Valerie are together.  I don't think White Tossie and Tahee were ever really together.  No, they were, the black couple, they were hilarious. 
[00:28:00]  All I know, yeah, they were a mess.  And they weren't even included in the reunion.  And then Billy, Mandy, apparently aren't.  And Shannon and Andy got married.  But they wanted to do that from day one of the show.  Right.  All right.  So, are you trying to be an actress, or are you going to do the doctor thing for a while?  I would like to be doing more medicine and media.  Combine those two.  Medicine and media.  Yeah.  I'd like to be doing some sort of funky Dr. Drew thing, you know.  You're doing it today with the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  This is good. 
[00:28:30]  You're going to see some horrific sights today.  Oh, I can't wait.  We may show you something that you have never seen before.  No.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  It's something called Twato.  What?  Twato.  Twato.  Did you make that one up?  No.  Well, it's a...  I think that one's made up.  We think it's a genital wart, but we're not sure.  Well, it's not called Twato.  Huh?  We thought it would.  It might be honest.  Well, we just, you know, we just call it that because of Twato.  We named it.  You see Total Recall? 
[00:29:00]  You ever see Total Recall?  Total Recall.  I'd get you ass to Mars.  I might have fallen asleep during that.  Yeah.  Well, the guy had a conjoined twin named Quato that knew all, told all.  Like a parasitic twin sticking up?  Yeah.  Okay.  So we call it a Twato.  Like a little head or something.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Parasitic twin.  That's it.  Conjoined twin is the full deal.  That's when you've got a full disorder of your body.  I love doctors.  I would love her to be my doctor.  I can't find that website, by the way.  I don't think it's active anymore.  Oh, well, sometimes it gets too much business and they shut it down because it's on a free 
[00:29:30]  server.  Well, you know what?  One of our listeners has to send the picture, please.  Yeah.  Somebody probably has it.  From the 95 issue.  Yeah.  Oh, you know where else it is?  Huh?  I'll write it down.  My friend has a website.  Oh, you write that down now.  Yeah.  There we go.  Get that website.  Yeah.  Penn State tried to sue them for it, but they didn't.  All right.  Mike has a question for you.  Mike, what's up?  Yeah, I was interested into knowing, what perks do they get to try to get this score 
[00:30:00]  with the opposite sex?  Because it seems like they're all overly aggressive.  You mean in real life or on top ten?  Well, secretly or whatever, because it just seems like, you know, it seems like half the  time, especially on the new one, they're like attacking the people.  Oh, well, on ours, that didn't happen, and there was no incentive financially or otherwise  to, you know, hook up with anyone.  But the new one, I've heard rumors that there's some ringers and some actual strippers on the  show.  Oh, really?  Yeah, some girls. 
[00:30:30]  They're trying to spice it up a little bit?  Yeah, I think some of them are just, you know.  Yeah, I can believe that, because I was watching it last night, and, you know, everybody's  crazy for that Ed Mundo, and I don't know what they see in the guy.  And they're attacking him.  Yeah, I think...  See, we blew off the Temptation Island after the first one.  Yeah.  Like the first one, didn't get hooked on the second one, so...  Yeah.  First one was better.  I didn't like the cloaks when they came out and dropped their cloaks.  I don't know if you said...  Yeah.  All right.  Ciao, Owen A.  Thank you, Mike.  Thanks, man.  Did you find the picture, Ed?  No, it was.  We're still working on it.  I see a lot of party pictures. 
[00:31:00]  I see you with a chubby guy with a huge beer in his hand.  Yeah, that's Mick.  He's a really nice guy.  I see you.  Wow.  With a little top on it, some big outdoor shindig.  Oh, that's Preakness.  That was a couple years ago.  Wow.  Wow.  You know something?  The top you are wearing right now is very deceiving.  Yeah.  It is?  Yeah, let me see.  It is?  Sort of.  Well, there's a course there.  You could see.  You could tell.  Yeah.  You could tell, but...  You know, it's...  But when you look at something like that... 
[00:31:30]  I don't look like a woman naked or anything.  This?  Oh, believe me, we wouldn't argue.  Yeah, turn it around, Anthony, please.  Look at that one.  Oh, yeah.  See?  Oh, that's a horrible picture.  You got to check out the old website when it's not being blocked by Yahoo.  Oh, my goodness.  Wow.  Look at that picture of you.  What's that?  Turn it around, Ant.  That one.  Oh, yeah.  That's it.  That's the...  Wow.  Oh, my God.  That's from Playboy, huh?  That's from Playboy.  Were there others? 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, Playboy had posted them up on their website.  After I was on the show, they put up, like, 11 more from the main shot.  They did.  Yeah.  Of course, I made no money off of it, but, you know, you had to pay to see them.  That's a great shot there.  Yes.  Looking good.  Kurt, what's going on?  No, no.  I was just looking at the picture.  It ain't nothing.  She ain't naked.  What are you talking about?  I'm looking at the Playboy.  It's October.  October 95.  The one where she's on her belly?  Yeah.  Well, you get to see the nice butt.  Yeah, but no nip.  Yeah, right.  Technically, it's not nude, which is really funny. 
[00:32:30]  Technically, that's not nude.  Semi-nude is you can see nipples.  Full nudity is pubic hair.  It's barely spackable.  I am not nude.  Barely spackable.  You could imagine a batch all over that butt.  The cheeks are amazing.  I was in med school at the time.  You're easily pleased.  So, you could bring that Playboy issue home to Mom and Dad and be proud.  Hey, Kurt.  That's all they gave it to me.  Hey, Kurt, you faggot.  Hey.  Use your imagination, man.  Look at her ass.  The whole page is covered with nude chicks, and she's not nude.  That's a great ass.  She's a doctor, though.  To see a doctor's hiney like that, that's so nice. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, please.  It's a nice hiney.  Nice hiney.  You sound like a four-year-old.  Kurt, there's nothing wrong with leaving some for the imagination.  Yeah.  Hey, go get a copy of Swank and look at roast beef falling out of places.  You nut.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Jim.  Jim, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Hey, Jim.  Hey, yo.  Hey, O.N.A.  Yeah.  I've seen an issue.  I've pretty much what you guys have just been talking about.  She's definitely really hot.  But the thing is, she has a second issue also. 
[00:33:30]  I think she did it twice.  Is that true, Alton?  No.  Did you ever show the breasts there?  Did I?  No.  I didn't do it then.  Huh?  I don't know.  Maybe he showed his breasts.  Maybe.  You don't want to?  Because we're now seeing some other shots of you where you're more naked and kind of covering  up the top area.  Those were the other Playboy ones from the same team.  No, she was making it in Temptation, Ireland.  Oh, yeah.  She's good to see it, though. 
[00:34:00]  Right.  They didn't show it.  We went semi-skinny-yipping one night.  But every time I got out of the water, I had them covered.  Very nice.  All right, Jim.  Thank you.  No.  Thanks, guys.  Lee.  All right.  Oh, what website's that?  There's more pictures of you.  I don't know.  I'm putting in passwords now.  There's all kinds of stuff going on.  I found them on, like, Russian porn sites.  There it is.  Let me see.  But she said there's no naked pictures of her.  Completely naked, actually.  No, no.  There's not naked.  Just about. 
[00:34:30]  But, wow, that's pretty good.  There's a shot of you.  Your leg is up.  See, there's where the reach is.  You're bending over.  Your arm is just covering Nip.  All right.  Maybe.  I'll give her that.  Then there's other shots that are like the shot that was in the magazine.  Gene, what's going on?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Yeah, remember me from the other eight?  Gene, the Mad Man.  Yeah, what's up, man?  Yeah, what's up, dude?  Listen.  How do you guys watch this crap?  This temptation island?  I just had a question.  I liked the first one.  I didn't watch the...  Yeah, we got hooked on the first one. 
[00:35:00]  I haven't watched one episode of the second one.  Yeah, because I'm wondering.  Because these people go on there, and then at the end, they're crying about,  oh, well, you know, I can't believe he did this.  Well, what do you think you're getting into?  Exactly.  When you get on a show like that, you know what I mean?  Exactly.  You know, it's just BS, man.  And what was she, one of the temptresses?  I was a temptress.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, see?  And then you're screwed as the guy, because if you go in that situation,  you blow off your girlfriend that you went to the island with for a hot piece of ass  like this doctor over here.  You're not going to want to date that guy, because you see what he did to his girlfriend, right? 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  You have to wonder who did it.  Yeah, I wanted to say something else, man.  Norton rules, and Jay Moore sucks Patty's dirty toenails.  There you have.  Jay Moore playing Rascals tonight.  Two shows.  Oh, Jay Moore?  Yeah.  You got a lot of...  I won't be there.  All right.  Thank you.  All right, dude.  You got a lot of the doctors hitting on you?  No.  No?  Not where I'm working now.  Or maybe they are.  At the gay hospital?  Where are you working?  Geez.  Gay hospital.  Well, I work at 7 p.m. to 7 a.m., so it's really late at night. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  And, uh...  Just imagine what you could accomplish during those hours.  Those are the times you could push her into the pharmaceutical closet.  Not much security around.  I'd constantly be showing up for checkups.  Sorry, I got that on your shoes.  Yeah, but you have to be sick enough to get admitted to the hospital.  Oh, he's the sickest you're ever going to see.  I mean...  I mean, just...  Are we going to spend this much time with all the doctors?  Hell no.  Of course not.  She took up all the other time with the other doctors. 
[00:36:30]  Yes.  Oh, they're going to be mad at me.  No.  All right.  Well, she's going to help us today with what the hell is that.  Now, are you ready for this?  Because I...  Um, yeah, I think so.  And you...  I saw some of the people out there.  Yeah.  Now, you're probably pretty familiar with people that are coming in and going,  Hey, what is this?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Okay.  Family practice.  So you'll be able to give, like, a little, you know, a little recommendation, maybe.  A little guess.  Something like that.  Of course, not an actual diagnosis.  No, it's not a diagnosis or anything. 
[00:37:00]  Right, right.  It's just probably you could tell people, Hey, go to a doctor and have this checked out.  I believe it's this.  Yes.  And something like that.  I understand.  All right.  Well, sure.  We're going to talk to the rest of the doctors.  And then I think we should start the festivities.  Yes.  Right.  We have a few people standing by and we'll have them come in and they'll strip and do whatever  they have to do.  And the doctors will take a look in the uncovering there.  I've never seen a naked person.  Okay, doctor.  All right.  As we go to break, the FU line, a very popular feature on the Opie and Anthony show, you 
[00:37:30]  can go to opieandanthony.com to get the number of the FU line, all right?  Yeah.  Let's check it out and see what's going on today.  Ah, it's A.  Ah, it's A.  It's not B.  It's A.

Before we get the doctors in here and a couple of our, uh, quote, patients,  Yeah.  Uh, we got to talk about the homeless shopping spree.  Homeless shopping spree, too, happens this coming Tuesday.  More giving from the Opie and Anthony show.  We love to give back.  A lot of people still trying to figure out what mall we're going to. 
[00:40:00]  We don't even know.  It's down to three malls.  And we'll decide early next week.  Yeah.  We're going to, uh, have a bunch of homeless guys shopping.  We're encouraging the listeners to join them and help them out and join in the fun.  Right?  Yes.  And we've been meeting the, uh, homeless people that are going to be, uh, joining us this Tuesday.  We've been, uh, talking to them on the phone.  Out on the streets.  We've met Ziggy.  Uh-huh.  We met Tippi Tom, the, uh, the gay homeless guy.  Yeah.  We met Sperm yesterday. 
[00:40:30]  Who's, uh, got the bug, from what I hear.  Sperm's got the bug.  Got the bug.  The hiv.  And it's time to meet a new homeless guy.  That'll be helping us with the homeless shopping spree.  It's Rock and Roll Tommy.  Rock and Roll.  What's up, man?  Hey, Rock and Roll Tommy.  Yeah, I can hardly hear you, man.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Why is that?  I don't know.  I guess it's a telephone.  Well, we'll talk a little louder.  All right.  Rock, why do they call you Rock and Roll Tommy?  Because, uh, I'm about, I'm 50 years old. 
[00:41:00]  I played drums for a long time.  I played in a lot of bands.  Yeah?  Uh.  Are you Ginger Baker?  I run around, I'm a homeless guy, I run around with like 500 CDs, man.  500 CDs.  Wait a minute.  I don't understand.  Why?  Humble pie, thin, Lizzie.  No, why does, why does a homeless guy need 500 CDs?  Because I need my music, man.  Where do you, where do you plug in?  So you can listen to your computer. 
[00:41:30]  I plug in into my CD player, bro.  Where's your CD player?  It's like right to my pants.  Oh, you got like a Walkman.  Yeah.  A Discman.  All he needs is batteries, Anthony.  That's right.  So why are you, uh, homeless?  Uh, uh, what was the big day?  Where'd it go wrong?  It's a long story, man.  The heroin.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  That's all right.  All right.  We gotta watch the S-word.  But it's the heroin and the methadone and all that fun stuff that, uh, led you to the  Rome, uh, road trip.  Yeah, but I hear you got a lot of criminals coming on your truck there, man.  No.  Yeah, I have, man. 
[00:42:00]  Wow.  Is that the word on the street?  Oh, Keith got people he just locked up for assault coming on that truck.  Well, that's fine.  We don't mind a little assault.  I don't mind.  I mean, I'm, you know, I'm brave.  Hell, assault is not what you should be worried about, man.  I'm broke, you know, and, uh...  You gotta worry about the bug.  Huh?  Hey, Keith.  Uh, Keith.  Sorry, Keith.  Rock and roll Tommy.  I was looking up at the screen.  Kizzy Tommy's my main man, man.  Oh, yeah.  I taught him how to be homeless.  Oh, you did?  I hope you didn't teach him how to be gay. 
[00:42:30]  That's gotta be taught.  Yeah, I know.  James is a good friend of mine.  How do you teach someone to be homeless?  Don't go in that house.  Don't you live under that roof.  Yeah, see?  You're making a mistake.  You're living under a roof.  Let me teach you.  Don't go in that house.  Please.  Well, why don't we ask him?  How did you teach him?  I mean, what did you teach him?  I just taught him not to go into any doorways, whether it's a building.  Why is that bad?  Because there might be a home in there that he could live in.  No.  No.  No.  No.  I saw you.  Rock and roll Tommy. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, you know.  When I met rock and roll Tommy, when you see rock and roll Tommy, he looks like a mob.  He looks like he was at a GQ two years ago.  Oh, yeah?  Now he looks like a piece of cheese that's been left out to go home, man.  Oh, my God.  Hey, rock and roll Tommy.  When you meet Tippy Tom.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're looking forward to meeting Tippy Tom and looking forward to seeing Ziggy again  and meeting Sperm and meeting yourself, rock and roll Tommy. 
[00:43:30]  You know what I mean?  You got a lot.  Do you know Sperm?  I thought Keith was just trying to get up to 14th Street of Sperm.  Is this on the radio, by the way?  Yeah.  Yeah, we're on the radio.  Can I have the radio right now?  I'm trying to ask rock and roll Tommy a question.  Oh, okay.  Rock and roll Tommy.  Yeah.  Where do you keep 500 CDs?  In my bag.  In your bag?  What?  You got like a backpack?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I was curious.  You don't have a shopping cart?  No, I don't have a Cadillac. 
[00:44:00]  They call that a Cadillac on the street?  I don't have a Cadillac.  The shopping cart.  Now, are the people with the shopping cart?  Oh, yeah.  The large shopping carts and the small ones.  The small ones are a Volkswagen.  The large ones are a Cadillac.  Rock and roll Tommy.  Are the people with shopping carts, are they looked up to or looked down upon?  I don't know.  It depends where you're looking at them from.  No, I mean, is it a good thing to have a shopping cart out on the street,  or is that like a person can't even hold his own stuff on them? 
[00:44:30]  Well, I keep my stuff hidden.  You know what I mean?  I keep my bedding hidden.  You stay in there?  I have a whole bedroom hidden.  You have a bedroom that's hidden.  Now, is it above ground or underground?  Yeah.  No, I have it hidden in scaffolds.  Scaffolds.  In scaffolds, like a construction scaffolding around the city somewhere?  Yeah.  And then at night, you go back to the scaffolding, you take out your bedding,  and where do you put it that is warm and dry? 
[00:45:00]  Oh, I can't tell you that.  Well, don't tell me exactly, but what type of structure are you in that keeps the weather off of you?  I have a piece of plywood over me.  Ah.  I have a load of corrugated under me.  I have a mattress.  A corrugated.  Very good.  It keeps the water off.  And I have about three comforters at this point.  Three comforters.  I bet they smell great.  You're living large, bro.  No, I'm not.  I mean, it's sad.  It's real sad.  Yeah.  I have lived large. 
[00:45:30]  Well, do you want to get off the street?  Yeah, I do want to.  I do want to.  I'm looking to.  You're still doing the drugs there, Rock and Roll?  No, I'm just on methadone.  But, I mean, methadone is worse than heroin.  I don't know if you're familiar with this subject, but...  So you've got to line up for your shots or what?  Huh?  You've got to line up for that stuff.  I mean, I'm trying to get into a detox.  Oh, yeah?  To get off the methadone, yeah.  Yeah, that's some rough stuff I hear, huh?  What?  That's rougher than heroin to get off.  I've been in jail, man. 
[00:46:00]  I've been like, you know, six, seven, eight, nine days without it.  And Keith will tell you, he's the one who locks me up, man.  Keith has locked me up about six times, man.  I'm a freaking flyer with Keith.  What do you do that you get locked up for?  What are your little crimes?  Drinking.  Drinking, what, in public?  Drinking beers.  And you're just drunk?  Drinking the beers.  Are you belligerent when you get drunk?  Do you get rowdy and all?  No, I'm, you know, that's what I'm saying.  I mean, I've, you know, people have said, hey, Keith's looking for you.  Keith's looking for you. 
[00:46:30]  Everyone I know that Keith has told about this thing has, like, been arrested, like, within  the last three weeks for, like, beating down on somebody, man.  Well, we're going to have a fine crew.  Yeah, yeah.  And, you know, I mean, I'm not afraid to come, but, I mean, it's going to be a fiasco.  It's going to be a lot of fun, Rock and Roll Tommy, and we would love to extend the...  Gray Wolf's in a, in a, in a, thank God, he's in a therapeutic community.  Oh, because we're looking for Gray Wolf.  No, he's, he's in, uh, he's in a therapeutic. 
[00:47:00]  Sorry.  That's all right.  Oh, hey, hey.  I keep, I, you know, I...  That's okay.  It's, uh, you're talking like you're on the street.  Rock and Roll Tommy, we would like you to join, uh, the rest of the guys, uh, for the, uh,  homeless shopping spree that's coming up.  Uh, you want to go?  Definitely.  All right, we'll toss you some cash, and, uh, you'll go shopping.  I just want to ask him two questions before we let him go in.  All right.  Uh, Rock and Roll Tommy, you know any mole people?  Any what?  Any of the mole people, the people that live underground?  No, I haven't gotten that far there.  But you don't know any of them? 
[00:47:30]  No.  They live, uh, they take, uh, they don't even mingle.  Any other questions?  Uh, what was the last movie you saw?  Uh, that's a good question.  The last movie I saw was, uh, uh, Blue Street.  What, which one was that?  Martin Lawrence?  Yeah.  Oh, you saw that?  Oh, Blue Street.  Dave Chappelle.  Yeah.  Martin?  I saw it in jail.  Oh, you saw it in jail.  Okay.  They hooked you up in jail for you? 
[00:48:00]  It was great.  Oh, in jail, you see all a bunch of movies.  Was it, was that a movie, or was that just actually Martin in jail acting it out?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, rock and roll Tommy.  You rock.  All right, man, uh, we'll be looking forward to, uh, seeing you at the homeless shopping spree,  man.  All right, buddy.  All right.  Cool.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Now, we'll hook you up.  That's cool.  You know how many people are going to be there, though?  That's all right.  That's all right.  Don't worry about it.  All right.  It's going to be like 100,000 people there, man.  All right, my brother.  You got me down on the list, right?  You're on. 
[00:48:30]  You're on, man.  All right.  Thank you, Connelly.  All right.  There he goes.  Rock and roll Tommy.  All right.  God bless you, man.  And you, too, giving away, uh, confidential information that we had at Dumbar.  He didn't know, though.  I understand.  Ex-Heroen addict.  He's on the methadone.  And he gets arrested, uh, all the time for, uh, drinking.  Drinking.  He's got 50 CDs in his backpack.  Oh, 500.  He doesn't have a Cadillac.  He just goes with a backpack.  And he sounds like a very interesting guy. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  And he knows, uh, Tippi, uh, he knows Tippi Tom.  He knows Tippi Tom.  The gay homeless guy.  So, we're going to, we're going to have a fine crew.  Who he said looks like he, uh, came out of GQ two years ago.  And in two short years, he looks like old cheese that's been left out.  That's funny.  So, oh, my God.  You know, the malls have got to be scrambling, trying to figure out which mall we're going to with these guys.  And what the hell are they going to do to try to, uh, stop it? 
[00:49:30]  All right.  Here's the roll call, Anthony.  We have Ziggy coming back this year.  We have Tippi Tom.  Mm-hmm.  The gay homeless guy.  Yeah.  We have Sperm, who has the bug.  Yeah.  We have Rock and Roll Tommy, who's an ex-heroin addict.  And he's on the methadone.  Yes.  And, uh, let's not forget, we have Snoop Dogg.  Snoop Dogg.  Well, not the Snoop Dogg.  No, but a guy, uh, he's joining us for the second time.  Snoop Dogg.  Cool guy.  Very cool guy.  So, hopefully we'll talk to some more of our participants. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, I can't wait for this.  As the day continues here on the Open Anthony Show.  I just can't wait to hear about the horrified mall employees.  Jason from Saddlebrook says, uh, are we sure that Rock and Roll Tommy isn't really Lane Staley of Alice in Chains?  It goes big.  I thought we were going to talk to, uh, Rock and Roll Johnny Race.  No, Rock and Roll Johnny.  Rock and Roll!  Rock and Roll!  Rock and Roll!  Rock and Roll!  Rock and Roll, everybody.  Johnny Race, Rock and Roll!  Rock and Roll.  Now we've got Tommy Rock and Roll. 
[00:50:30]  All right, Jay, what's going on?  Not much.  I just wanted to know if that guy showed up that, uh, he sweats on half his face when he's running,  and, uh, the other half when he's on the sauna or something.  Rick?  He is here.  All right.  Do we have any, uh, wings from Hooters?  Uh, they're, they're on their way.  All right, good, because the hot wings make him sweat on one side of his face, and the  other side's completely dry, and then if he works out, where he builds up a sweat, he'll  sweat on the other side of his face, and the side that, uh, sweats with the hot wings  is completely dry.  Right.  You're a big fan of him, Jay, or what?  Um, well, I just thought it sounded pretty funny. 
[00:51:00]  I do a lot of funny stuff, but, uh, that kind of, I think, tops me.  All right, cool.  All right.  When are you going to have another one of these?  Because I, no, what is that?  But I have something I can do that's, uh, pretty outrageous.  What do you do?  What can you do?  All right, it sounds, I know it sounds weird, but I can eat, like, anything.  Like, if you, if you were to give me a Big Mac, I can eat the whole thing in any, you  know, just swallow it down, and I can bring up any part of it.  You want me to bring up a pickle?  I can actually bring up a piece of pickle.  Rick, book it. 
[00:51:30]  Rick, book it.  Book it!  Are you kidding me?  No, it's really weird.  Now, how can you distinguish a pickle from a piece of, uh, ground beef?  Yeah, I can just, I can, I can taste it as it comes up.  It's really, it's really strange.  It's really strange.  But when I was younger, I used to do it with, like, goldfish, and I could do it with ping-pong  balls.  And I want to see the Big Mac trick.  I want to see you bring a pickle up after you eat it.  I will definitely do it.  I work for an airline, so I fly for free.  All right, well, great.  Where do you live, bro?  I live in Boston. 
[00:52:00]  So you're going to have to come down for this one.  What'd you say?  You're going to have to come down to New York to do it.  Yeah, that's fine.  That's fine.  All right, hey.  All right, Rick, make sure you get his info, and, uh, we'll hook that up.  Hey, Jay, you want tickets to the Pats game, or what?  Do I want tickets to the Pats game?  Yeah, could you go?  Sure.  I'm serious.  I mean, these are very, uh, valuable tickets, but we'll give you a pair if you're going to  use them.  Absolutely.  All right, we got the, uh, pair of tickets to the Pats this, uh, this Sunday with, uh, with  the Browns at Foxboro.  Wow, that'd be awesome.  Tickets courtesy of WBCN. 
[00:52:30]  Hold on the line, all right?  Sure.  Jay's going to come down, uh, to Boston, uh, from Boston to show us a few, uh, tricks.  That sounds like, uh, some kind of, uh, that's a real talent.  You could swallow a Big Mac, and then we tell him, all right, bring up a tomato.  And he'll, he'll bring up a tomato.  Bring up a pickle.  He could bring up the pickle.  I gotta see that.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Just wanted to keep you up on some of the street lingo.  Yeah.  I just learned a new word.  It's not A's, and it's not the Hiv.  It's the ninja.  Ninja?  The ninja.  That's what they call it. 
[00:53:00]  Because it creeps up on you and gets you?  That's it.  I like that.  The ninja.  He's got the ninja.  I think we'll be, uh, seeing that on What Did We Learn at the end of the show.  And we know what a Cadillac is.  Right.  Cadillac.  The big shopping cart.  Take it easy, guys.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  You ever see the tandem shopping carts some of the homeless got?  It seems like the real bad homeless have the carts, though.  Yeah.  Like, they're the real kooky ones.  I saw one guy.  He had tandem carts.  Two shopping carts linked together.  He's pulling.  And the front had, uh, had all of his gear. 
[00:53:30]  And the back was all cans and bottles.  Like, that was his commercial.  His business venture.  And then the other one was his home life.  Very resourceful.  Right, for tax purposes.  All right.  Tax purposes.  Do we have, uh, time to start?  What the hell is that?  Yeah, we could go a few more minutes here.  Why don't we get the doctors in here?  We met, uh, the lovely Dr. Allison.  Also helping us today, Anthony, is Dr. Mike.  A guy that just wants to be called Doc.  And Dr. Rich. 
[00:54:00]  Here come, uh, the doctors.  Look at that.  It's like a soap opera.  The doctors.  Hey, why don't the guys dress up in their leather outfits like Dr. Allison there?  What do you think of Dr. Allison, guys?  You see many like her around?  Oh, yeah.  The hospital's loaded.  You got to talk into a mic.  The hospital's loaded with women like that.  Right.  Yeah, sure.  As he rolls his eyes.  It's the worst.  She's like the TV type, uh, doctor.  The ones that you never see in real life, you know? 
[00:54:30]  When they got to take your temperature the old-fashioned way, it's usually some heifer.  Hey, move Dr. Allison over, because she's on, like, the stinky cam,  and everyone's enjoying her adjusting her top every two minutes.  Oh, right here?  Oh, okay.  Nice.  Her leather top.  Yeah.  And you guys got to talk right into that mic, or no one's going to hear you, all right?  Now, uh, Dr. Allison, the hot one, she's a family doctor.  Uh, what are you guys?  Internal medicine.  Internal medicine.  Oh, okay.  Um, physical medicine and rehab.  It's neuromuscular, musculoskeletal.  All right.  Emergency medicine.  Emergency medicine. 
[00:55:00]  There you go.  We got some emergency cases right here.  Anyone else?  Did we miss anyone?  Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's it.  Okay.  Doc, that's going to be here on the mic.  I hear you.  All right.  Should we start the festivities?  Sure.  Yeah, let's bring in our first case.  It's Danielle Clark.  Rick's the bitch that's usually at reception.  Danielle has huge, huge breasts.  Wow.  They never call your name.  Hi.  Hi, Danielle.  Hey, how you doing?  I'm all right.  How are you?  Good.  Now, where are you from? 
[00:55:30]  Ariel.  Ariel, Sicklerville, New Jersey.  Of course.  Yeah.  I was there last week, I think.  It's over by Philly.  We have to mention the obvious.  You've got huge, huge breasts.  Yes.  Huge.  How big are they?  Well, last time they were checked, they were double G's.  Double G's.  Double G's.  Like good God.  Yeah.  Hell yeah.  And you call us to tell us that you might have an extra...  Nip.  Nip.  Yes.  Well, there you go.  This is...  Doctors, do you see a lot of this? 
[00:56:00]  Is this a common thing?  It's common.  Very common.  People think it's a mole.  Do you feel better?  A lot of people think it's a mole and it turns out to be a second or third nip.  Why are the doctors smiling?  You guys are loving this, aren't you?  We need to touch it, you know.  Now, doctors, I've heard about this before.  And usually, don't they follow a line up and down?  Exactly.  Actually, down from...  Oh, really?  What is that called, doctor?  It's called the milk line.  The milk line.  Yes.  It's down to the groin.  Right.  But it's never...  Like, you wouldn't see one in the middle of a chest. 
[00:56:30]  No, never.  No cyclops nip or nothing.  That's only in, like, the globe or the star.  I don't know.  Or a total recall again, if I may bring up that fine movie again.  I don't know.  Okay, so where is yours?  Right under here.  It's right under the left one.  That means you're going to have to take off the sweater and the shirt.  I can just lift right here.  With the size of those, that could be anything from a third nipple to a pinto.  That's nice.  She's taking her shirt off.  Very professional here. 
[00:57:00]  Let's keep this professional, guys.  No oohing and aahing.  Of course not.  When she lifts her top off.  All right, go ahead, Daniel.  Because this is, of course, we're just trying to...  Are we doing this now?  Yeah, don't be shy.  We're trying to...  This is all professional...  Oh, my God.  I think we need the light on.  Yeah, get the light on there.  Doctors all take a look.  They're all looking at me.  How long have you had this?  Pretty much got my boobs.  And this is an areola here also, I see around there.  Can you actually bring out the other, the real one, the one that's above that, so we can compare the two? 
[00:57:30]  No, I'm not taking out my whole boobs.  Oh, jeez, I tried, Opie.  Prove.  What do you think that is?  Well, see, we don't want to say we're diagnosing.  No, no, it's...  It looks like that's what it is.  You're going to give an opinion.  Hi, Dr. Allison, what do you think?  I think that is a supernumerary nipple.  Supernumerary.  Supernumerary.  Yeah, that's what it's going on.  Is that what it looks like?  Well, we know her boobs are super.  Yeah.  Now, are these functional, doctor? 
[00:58:00]  Sometimes people have a lot of tissue and they can get...  They can lactate?  They can, yes.  How about that?  How about that?  And what do the other doctors say?  Doctors, do you concur?  I'm 100% correct.  Yeah.  Concur.  Concur.  Absolutely.  I like...  Look how professional this is.  It's moving along.  I love this.  Wipe the smiles off your faces.  Oh, my God.  I, too, concur.  I don't know.  No, what do you think?  What do I know?  I think that the doctors are correct. 
[00:58:30]  What do you think of her boobies there?  We didn't get to see much.  We couldn't see them.  Yeah.  We saw the one little...  I would have liked to have compared the one.  Yeah, docs, what are you doing to us here?  Don't you need to compare or something?  You may have to do the full breast exam to really...  Yeah.  There's no extra tissue.  Is there any future problems that can develop from something like this, doctor?  That maybe she should be aware of?  You just want to get it checked like any breast tissue.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's hot when you say it.  I'd like to see Dr. Allison check the breast tissue. 
[00:59:00]  Nice.  Yeah.  And is there anything she could do for that?  No.  Nothing?  You can get it removed.  You can get it surgically removed.  Would you like to actually?  The scar ends up being bigger than the nipples.  Really?  It looks like a mall to anybody that can see it.  Right.  So you don't have a problem with it?  You wouldn't want to get...  She's had it since...  She's had it.  She can't...  She's had it forever, she says.  You've got to get headphones on.  And I'm like walking around lifting them up to you.  Right.  And it's underneath, so it's not very obvious.  Not many people get to see it. 
[00:59:30]  Right.  All right.  Well, our first case.  And is this a common thing, Doc?  Very common.  Everyone actually is born with them, but they involute before you're born out of the...  Involute.  God, I love Dr. Paul.  Did you just have the word involute on our radio show?  Dr. Paul.  Nice.  Someone's going to use that in the...  What did we learn today?  They involute.  Look out, upper demos.  Yeah.  Here they go.  Involute.  So we should use, like, words like they kind of...  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Trust me.  No, that's okay.  We need to sound more intelligent.  So you use words like involute. 
[01:00:00]  Really?  You're kind of born with those and then they...  Every human being has them all.  And why do we have those when we're born?  Why do men have them for crying out loud?  Because they feel lovely when receiving treats.  That's true.  God's not sure it's going to be a dog yet.  We're like animals.  It's the same exact thing.  It's what the dogs have.  Yeah, it's like the dogs have them all running down there.  We have tails, too, so, you know.  Some of us still do.  Let's ask Danielle.  Are you happy with the opinions of the doctors?  Oh, yeah.  I appreciate it.  Thank you.  At least I know for sure now what it is. 
[01:00:30]  All right.  There you go.  Our first case.  Look at this.  We're helping.  I love it.  Wait, that's nothing.  We got some real freak shows.  We're just warming up with that one.  What, Rick?  Is it cancerous?  Is it cancerous?  No.  Should it be at all?  Oh, my God, Rick.  What kind of alarming word you want to throw in?  Why would you take the hotness out of this?  Can she get AIDS from having that?  Is there something...  All right.  Should we get the next guy in before we take a break?  All right. 
[01:01:00]  Let's at least get him in and see...  His name's Mike.  Thank you, Danielle.  Thank you, Danielle.  Our first case.  And what the hell is that?  It's been taken care of.  The doctors will see you.  Are we getting pictures?  The doctors will see you now.  Look at how Rick is seeing the receptionist.  We're getting pictures of all these guys?  Oh, yeah.  And gals?  Can I take pictures?  Huh?  Can I take pictures of them?  Oh, you sure can.  Yeah, if you see something that you've never seen before, take a picture and...  I have a camera with me.  Yeah.  And bring it back to the gang at the hospital, all right?  All right.  Where are you from, Mike?  Jersey.  All right, right on.  Another one from Jersey. 
[01:01:30]  There seems to be something happening.  Another girlfriend that just walked out here.  Really?  Yes.  And now you have something?  Yes, I do.  Hmm.  All right.  I'm afraid.  I get fearful.  Well, I see what he has on the chart here, Anthony.  Oh, you're looking at his chart?  He's got a...  Let's just say he's got a growth.  Is it in his pants?  Has it growth?  Is it in the lower?  It's below the belly button, yes.  Oh, my God.  And above the...  The knees.  Oh, no.  What?  Let me read his chart, Opie.  All right.  Give me his chart. 
[01:02:00]  Let me look.  There's Mike in his chart.  Oh, my God.  This is not done in medical terminology.  I know.  You can't write it like that.  Well, on his chart.  Well, why don't you write it down for the doctor so they can maybe clean it up a little bit?  What's the medical term for...  Yeah, yeah.  See if you could...  Word that.  What?  See if you could word that in a way that we can say on the air.  On the air.  A scrotal growth? 
[01:02:30]  All right.  A scrotal growth.  A scrotal growth.  Okay.  All right.  Well, um...  Oh, Jesus.  Right.  I see the gloves are out and on.  Look at Mike.  Mike is rubbing his hands together because he sees the hot Dr. Allison putting gloves.  No.  He is.  Sight.  Mike, you're sight, right?  Dr. Allison, you have to be called away from this for a minute.  No.  Okay.  Well, I guess...  She was on Temptation Island, you know.  Oh, I know.  Okay.  All right, Mike.  Let's go watch some of those episodes. 
[01:03:00]  Well, I guess show the doctors your problem.  Oh, no.  I can't.  Oh, my God.  I can't.  He's very excited, though, because, uh...  Well, don't put it that way.  I didn't mean it like that.  All right.  Okay.  Doctor?  He's, uh...  Oh!  What the hell is that?  Well, um...  Hold on, please.  Yeah, it could be a skin tag.  It's a skin tag.  Hopefully not a wart, you know?  All right. 
[01:03:30]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  All right.  All right.  He just whipped out his yam bag, if I may use medical terminology.  And now we've got to kind of describe it so that it gets on the radio.  It's, uh...  And, uh, he's got a, uh, uh, uh, growth of skin that seems to be a dangling from, uh...  It looks as big as, um, like a raisinet, right?  Like the size of a raisinet.  And, uh, it did get some...  It's not as big as a raisinet.  No?  It's pretty close.  It got some gasps from, uh, people.  Yeah?  From some of the people.  I think that was just the fact that he was showing us that area.  Um... 
[01:04:00]  And now that you've had a chance to let it sink in, uh, any, any opinions, uh, of what  this could be and what he should do?  Skin tag.  Skin tag.  Which is just a growth type thing that pops up.  Skin tag?  What the hell is that?  Just an extra piece of skin that grows off of somewhere.  And can that be removed without a difficulty, a problem?  You just snip them off and...  I went to a doctor when I was like six or seven, I remember, and he was going to remove  it and I told him hell no was going anywhere near there with a knife.  Well, well, you...  You'd let, uh, housing go next to that. 
[01:04:30]  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Now, now, have you had a little Novocaine and that comes around?  A little Novocaine?  What it would have...  Some people just...  Well...  Some people just snip it.  Cut him with the scissors.  You can just cut it out.  No kidding.  Some people need to do them at home.  We used to...  All right, hold on.  What do we got?  Cut it from their own neck.  What do we got to give Mike, man?  We got...  We got scissors.  Oh, my God.  We got scissors.  The stock of it is almost dead.  I think you should use Patty's toenails from yesterday to cut it.  Did you guys bring any tools today?  No, they're not going to be performing procedures.  You can't do anything.  Of course not.  But they said they could cut it with a scissor.  No, he could cut it with a scissor at home. 
[01:05:00]  We would recommend it.  We would recommend, though, if you do cut it...  We recommend that you see your doctor to have it properly removed.  But save it and bring it in for what we are going to have.  Let's just tell the people we are thinking of having something we like to call Cannibal  Day here on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Coming to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Let's just put it this way.  Starker Patty's toenails are...  On the menu.  On the menu.  On the shelf just waiting for Cannibal Day.  And we would love to have your scrotal skin tag...  Oh, we're going to bring it in.  On there.  That's a big prize.  If someone eats that, they better get a trip. 
[01:05:30]  You get it removed.  You bring it in.  You can hang out with us all day.  We'll give you a prize and be part of the fun.  Now, any trouble explaining this thing to girls?  If girls ask you what this is or anything?  It was...  Oh...  Have you been with girls?  I've had them that I've had it my whole life and they just kind of...  They probably worry.  They're fine with it?  Nah.  Nobody really was worried.  They're fine.  They have no problem with it.  We're right on by it.  Give them the 20 bucks and they're off.  Now, I'm teasing, of course.  All right.  Well, that seems good.  Is it clear your mind a little that it's nothing to worry about? 
[01:06:00]  Now, I know exactly what it is.  Some kind of tag.  Well, go to the doctor.  Have it checked out and have it removed.  But bring it in in a sealed biohazard bag.  And Mike has a skin tag, Anthony.  There you go.  All right.  Our second diagnosis.  And Danielle had an extra nip.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to have to take a quick break, Anthony.  And he's waiting to come in as Heath.  He's the guy that has only half of his face that'll sweat.  Oh, this is interesting. 
[01:06:30]  You've heard about this, doctors?  Okay.  So, we'll get the...  You guys have heard of...  Yes.  They've heard of everything.  All right.  And John, fake name, has something that leaks.  Let's just put it back.  Oh, God.  No.  That's all I'm going to say.  So, we'll continue.  What the hell is that?  When is Sandy Cain arriving?  That's the grand finale.  She should be here very soon.  Yes.  I think with the gloves, not enough.  We have some of those outbreak biohazard suits, hazmat suits that you might want to put on. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, God.  Are there things that you guys see in the office where you just go, oh, my God, I don't even want to get near this?  Every day.  Odors.  Yeah.  Odors are worse than the night.  They drink in your city.  Odors, really?  What kind of odors?  Odors.  Like some people say they have a problem with their foot or their crotch.  Rotting things.  Rotting things.  What's rotting?  Parts of their body.  You know, ulcers.  Where are you?  Yeah, toes.  Ulcers, and the smell is just overwhelming.  Oh, man. 
[01:07:30]  It's madness.  Yeah.  It's happening.  You put a surgical mask on and act like it's normal, but you throw clone on the inside of it.  Oh, do you?  It's on your nose.  God damn.  Also, yeast infection in 400-pound women in inner-city hospitals.  Stop it.  Stop it.  You're getting all hot.  BV is the word.  VD.  BV.  Oh, BV.  Bacterial vaginosis.  Bacterial vaginosis.  It's a fishy odor.  That's what that means.  Oh, my God.  It smells too fresh.  All right.  So that's some kind of bacteria that's just dying and building up an odor. 
[01:08:00]  Hey, man.  I'm overgrown the bacteria.  Hey, man.  My first girlfriend had it.  Is it usually on fatter women?  Yeah, it is, right?  Normally?  I don't know.  You ran a lot of fat women.  Yeah, no one is.  I don't know.  My first girlfriend had it.  We tell the story a lot on the air.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She was a short little thing, too.  Had fun with a girl, you know, using his hands, let's just say.  And he had to drive the whole way back home with his hand out the window. 
[01:08:30]  From Geneseo.  True story.  It's not called a Geneseo.  It's a similar word.  Oh, the place.  Sorry.  You're talking about the region.  Yeah.  Nothing I did could get rid of.  Okay.  Well, let's take a break, and then we'll get back to what the hell is this with somebody  that has something that leaks.  Yeah, that and Heath that has half his face that sweats.  Right.  Okay.  Up next on the O&A Show.  O.P.  And for me.  Their psychosis is all real.  This is not an act. 
[01:09:00]  Ponderous.  F-ing Ponderous.  Hey, hey.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  We'll send that out to Twado.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's F.U. Friday.  Having a lot of fun with what the hell is that?  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  We've had a couple of cases so far come in.  We've had the girl with the third nip.  And it did indeed turn out to be a third nip.  Third nip with surrounding areola. 
[01:09:30]  Everyone's just laughing.  These doctors, they're just loads of fun.  They're passing out their medical books with all sorts of horrific photos.  Yeah, and Norton's looking through one of them ready to spank.  You sick bastard.  And then we had Mike with the growth.  Right.  Mike had a growth on his yam bag.  It's called a skin tag, Anthony.  A skin tag on his yam bag.  Right.  And, oh, now it's mine.  And he was told if he goes to a dermatologist or something, they could take that right off. 
[01:10:00]  Well, they said that this guy could go home with scissors and just cut it off.  Well, no, they didn't.  They didn't say that.  He would be known to do that.  What they said was some people have done that in the past, and it's not recommended.  What he should do is go to a dermatologist or something, and I guess they could take that right off for him.  All right.  And there's a dermatologist on the line that'll do it for free.  And he's advising that the guy does not do it because it'll gush blood. 
[01:10:30]  Let's just talk to Vinny real fast.  Vinny, what's up?  I'm going to...  How you doing, guys?  What's going on?  All right.  Hey, listen.  Skin tags bleed a lot, especially if they're on the scrotum.  If this guy takes a scissor to it, he's not going to be able to stop the bleeding for a couple of hours.  So tell him, do not do it at home.  If he wants, I can give him my information and come on in.  I'll take it off for him.  You've got to do it and then have sex right away so it just looks like a crime scene.  We'll even put it in a bottle.  We'll bring it in.  You can show it on your next...  What the hell is that?  Yeah, if you take it off...  Oh, what was that? 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, if you take it off, you've got to bring it back in here so we can do something with it.  on a future show.  Yeah, definitely.  I have no problem with that.  All right, hold on.  Someone get your info.  All right, Vinny?  You got it.  Thanks.  Take care.  Thank you.  Let me just go to Ron.  Ron?  Yeah?  You're on the Opie and Anthony show.  A-O-N-A.  What's up?  You, I'll come in and I'll bite that thing off of you.  You don't have to cut it off.  God, you sick son of a bitch.  Yeah, there's a lot of people calling and they're saying they'll delete the skin tag. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, that's...  Well, that's...  Wow, we grossed out the doctor.  All right.  That's cannibal day.  That's cannibal day.  And real fast, before we bring in our next patients, quote patients, we have to talk to  Nicky.  Nicky, what's up?  Hey, how you guys doing today?  All right.  Good, good.  Listen, I had a question before about that bacterial vaginitis.  Vaginosis.  Vaginosis.  Vaginosis, vaginitis.  My fiance's got that, I think.  Oh, God.  You would know, man. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, I know, but I mean, this is my fiance, the woman I'm going to marry, but it's interrupting  during sex.  Oh, wait.  So she doesn't know it or you haven't told her, hey, there's a problem down there?  Well, she knows, but I don't think that she thinks it makes that much of an impact on  me.  Oh, boy.  Because, you know, it's like when, at first it's fine, but once you start stirring the  juices, that's when there's a problem.  I hear you.  At first it's fine, but then you start stirring the juices. 
[01:12:30]  No, I'm not even going to look.  I'm not looking.  I'm disgusted.  This one isn't gross.  It's funny, actually.  No.  Oh, God, you bastard.  Let me see.  Let me see.  Let me see.  Oh, my God.  What a son of a bitch.  Don't tell me.  But listen, you guys still there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm telling you, this girl is beautiful.  She is.  She's absolutely stunning.  You know, you would never think.  All right.  Hold on, doctor.  What should he do?  What an idiot.  You think just the ugly girl's smell?  It might not be.  Exactly.  You know, you don't think that. 
[01:13:00]  It's kind of hard to go to your girl and say, hey, you know, your stench is killing me.  You know, what should this guy do?  I can't help him with the social implications of that.  But it's incredibly easy to treat.  Yeah.  A couple antibiotics and she's fresh as the breeze.  Yeah, but hot Dr. Allison said something.  It could be what?  It could be a few things.  A couple different things down there.  It could be trichomonas, bacterial vaginosis,  which is a whole bunch of bacteria.  Okay.  Can I say something that's a little bit kind of gross? 
[01:13:30]  Uh-oh.  Well, keep it radio-friendly.  So use only code words.  Code words.  All right.  Wrong.  Wrong.  Hold on.  Don't say it again either.  No, don't say it again.  Wrong.  Not a code word.  Okay, okay.  Wrong.  Try again.  Dumbass.  Nikki, shut up.  Let me walk you through this.  Just say, when we're doing the deed.  All right.  When we're doing the deed.  Right.  All right?  And say, and I say, idiot.  Dude, dude, dude, dude, listen to me. 
[01:14:00]  I'm better right now.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You could just say, when I'm done.  You don't have to say anything else.  We know what you're talking about.  You're being a little too specific.  Okay.  So let's just say, you're doing the deed.  Deed done.  Now you're done.  The deed is not done yet.  It's kind of like, I'm going to switch.  All right.  You're going to switch.  So he stops what he's doing.  Now they are separate entities for a moment. 
[01:14:30]  He wants to go to his backhand.  Right.  Right.  There you go.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it.  You could just say, now there's kind of like white stuff.  That's all.  You don't have to describe.  Don't describe where it is, what it's doing, how it's talking, or anything.  Deed done.  White.  Right.  Not that white, though.  Okay.  Because he's not actually done.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Very good.  So, doctors, is this common to have some kind of a residue like that? 
[01:15:00]  I don't know how specific I can get.  There is such a thing as a normal vaginal discharge.  Yeah.  It can be white to clear, and if it's not smelly or itchy, it's probably okay.  But if it's smelly, that's a problem.  All right.  Is that good?  Is there an odor to any of this byproduct, Nicky?  Yeah, absolutely.  All right.  That should be checked out.  Should be checked out, sir.  So, what do I do?  What do I say? 
[01:15:30]  What do you say?  Wow.  That is a tough one.  In the words of Jim Nord, you stink.  Just tell her that it smells like the toe webbing of a Haitian marathon runner.  That's no good.  Hey, I guess I just got to handle it on my own, huh?  Pretty much.  Hey, listen.  You guys rock.  Take care.  Hey, Nicky.  I'll tell you.  I'll tell you.  You give us the phone number.  We'll tell her right now on the air.  Nah, you're too crazy.  Oh, how about that?  No, we'll break it to her.  We'll be gentlemen. 
[01:16:00]  We'll break it.  We'll let the doctors do it.  Yeah.  Because this woman is my wife.  You know, I can't just say.  No, she's your fiancee and she's going to be your wife and you're going to have to live  with this for the rest of your goddamn life.  You don't fix it now.  Jeez, man.  Nah, I got to handle it on my own, though.  Why don't you call your wife and tell her that Opie and Anthony need to talk to you  and see if she goes for it.  I'll try that.  All right, cool.  Do that.  All right, thank you.  All right, take care.  Bye.  Bye.  All right.  Wouldn't it be great to just get on the phone and go, hey, your aunt stinks. 
[01:16:30]  Don't you know it?  Don't you know it?  You're horrifying the hot dog over there.  The guy's enjoying it.  He probably knows it, too, though.  Really?  Yeah.  Ignore it, yeah.  That's something that girls should not ignore.  And then they finally come in like, yeah, it sort of stinks.  I mean, they know, I think.  Oh, boy.  I think they know.  Yeah.  Can we change the subject?  Yeah, let's change the subject.  Mike, what's up?  Sounds like that guy's dealing with a real haunted house with hair on it.  Oh, we don't know what that means, so I hope they didn't dump out. 
[01:17:00]  Use your imagination.  Of course.  We do that on this show.  I'm sure you guys have a good imagination.  All right, Mike.  All right, here's the deal.  Since I've been younger, like, I don't know, nine, ten, I have, like, these little warts on my hands.  And they're not like them hard warts.  They're like little lesions.  They're not open or anything, but they've been there for, like, for years I've had them.  And they seem to grow slowly.  The doctors are rolling their eyes like big effing deal. 
[01:17:30]  Something we need to see.  No, no, it's disgusting.  All right.  I'm just afraid to go to the doctor.  I'm just going to get a quick opinion.  Why didn't you come in today?  You know what?  I haven't listened to you in a few days, and I missed the whole thing with getting sped up.  But I would have came down there.  Hey, Mike, thanks for supporting us.  We appreciate it.  No, I do support you.  I just was away for a few days.  What could the doctor say?  Someone would need to see it to tell you the truth, but stop touching yourself. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, no, no, I can't stop that.  I guess I'm living with the warts.  Yeah.  I'm never doing it.  I guess you guys all have warts, too, then.  We all just went and looked at our hands.  No, I'm fine.  It's all clean here.  That's because you use each other's hands on each other.  That's right.  Hey, Mike.  All right, ladies.  Yeah, thank you.  John from Boston has something.  Have you ever heard of this? 
[01:18:30]  He has a growth.  It's on his unit, but it only comes out when he's urinating.  It's like inside, I guess, the urethra.  Oh, what the hell is that?  The urethral prolapse.  And then there was...  Of course.  ...this is urethra.  He goes and it flops out.  Thread, probably.  And then it comes back in when he's done.  You've heard of that?  Urethral prolapse.  Is it a flag that says cow on it?  It's a flag that says cow.  Also, it could be a skin tag within the urethra. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, God.  Turn it out.  There's a scent.  It's a flag that goes cow.  Any private area stuff really is disturbing.  It really is disturbing.  All right, who's our next case?  Yeah, we've got to move on.  Flag that goes cow, though.  They'll make you giggle all weekend.  Bang.  Okay.  Does Heath have to eat?  Yeah, the wings just got here, so he's got to eat a few.  Why don't we bring him in and he can eat in the corner and he can tell us when he's ready.  Have him do that.  When he eats hot food, he sweats on only half his face. 
[01:19:30]  And then when he works out, he sweats on the other side.  And each time the opposing side stays dry.  What's up, Heath?  There's your wings from Hooters.  Oh, I see the doctor's pulling out a flashlight.  Are you going to check his pupils?  Oh, see?  Look at that.  What would that mean?  If he's sweating on one side of his face and his pupils don't dilate.  How long before you start sweating, Heath?  Very shortly.  Oh, okay.  And then we can go with Heath.  All right.  Those are some hot wings. 
[01:20:00]  Are they hot?  Are they hot wings or not?  Yeah.  Yeah?  It might take a minute.  That's all right.  Heath, where are you from?  This is probably just some crafty guy who wanted lunch.  Hey, I need wings.  Yeah, that's it.  Wings.  The right side when I eat.  Left side if I do something.  Oh, all right.  So the doctors are already asking questions.  Good.  And you've heard about this and you've diagnosed people that have this problem?  There's a syndrome called Horner's syndrome that you sweat only on one half of your face. 
[01:20:30]  Horner's syndrome.  And something happens to that one eye.  It's called meiosis and anhydrosis.  It's a disease of the nervous system, basically, where part of the nervous system on one side  of the face is blocked.  And it can cause damage to the nerves.  You can actually be born with it or it can be acquired over time.  Yeah?  Yes.  And is it serious?  Sometimes it's a tumor.  Well, it can be due to a tumor, but not always.  I mean, you can be born with it or you can acquire it.  How long have you had this?  Actually, I got into a motorcycle accident when I was younger. 
[01:21:00]  So that actually explains a lot.  Explains a lot of it.  Yeah.  It just started to happen.  After the motorcycle accident.  Did you fracture your spine, your cervical spine at all?  No.  No.  Ha ha.  No damage.  If you damage your spine, you know, like you said, you had a whiplash injury, any kind  of damage.  I broke a lot of bones and had metal plates put in and stuff.  But nothing in the neck?  Nothing in the neck.  Ha.  That's where it would be common.  Yeah, I might have had a little whiplash.  But there's also a lot of people that have this.  It's actually called hyperhidrosis.  It's excess sweating. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  And it can be, there's a surgical procedure that can be done on it, but most people, it  would be better to live with it.  Damn you.  God damn, Norton.  He just spins the book around and I looked at it.  Oh my God.  He's sweating.  Another cute picture.  You son of a bitch.  I don't want to see these open wounds on man junk.  This book is like Playboy to these days.  No, it's like Playboy to Norton.  He doesn't turn us on.  He's looking through it like, oh yeah.  All right, look at that open sore on that mule. 
[01:22:00]  Wait, Heath is sweating, I think.  Heath, you feel like you're sweating?  Oh yeah.  Oh look.  It's glazed on one side.  Wait, get under a light.  Yeah, get the light on.  Dude, that is amazing.  Look.  That is effed up.  He's glazed on one side and just on the side of the side.  That is effed up.  Cyborg.  Cyborg.  Dr. Allison's getting a good look.  What's going on with the pupils, doctor?  They're checking his eyes.  A lot of times when the nerves are damaged, it would also affect the pupils.  Right.  You can actually see the pupils.  One might dilate, the other one might constrict. 
[01:22:30]  And that would also confirm this type of syndrome.  Something tells me that would be a little more serious than just the sweating.  Wow.  Am I right, doctor?  Absolutely.  Yes, of course.  I shut my eyes.  No, I'm not looking.  I'm not looking.  Have you guys seen this before, docs?  Yes.  You have.  I haven't seen it.  Is there anything he could or should do for this?  It depends on what it's from.  Dude, I don't mean to interrupt you.  But the sweat is just dripping down the whole right of his face and the left side is completely dry. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, my God.  He's like Whitney Houston on that side.  He's sweating like a pig.  Beads of sweat just pouring down the side of his face.  You should legitimately go see a doctor because there is a tumor in the neck that can cause this.  And you want to make sure that that's not what it is.  Exactly.  A lot of times something can compress these nerves causing this type of irritation on the nerves.  So you really should go to a doctor just to get it checked out.  Just get it.  When was the last time you saw a doctor about anything about this or any other reaction to the motorcycle?  It's been a while.  It's been a while?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Definitely. 
[01:23:30]  In general, you never want to have anything that a doctor goes, oh, cool about.  It would be cool, though.  Yeah, that's something.  He's just half and half.  You know, if I do something physical, the other side sweats?  That's odd.  No.  That's bizarre.  This side will be bad.  You never want to hear a doctor say that's bizarre either.  The other side will sweat just the same way.  I have no idea what that is.  But it's basically like a misfiring in the nervous system.  And if a tumor has been ruled out or any kind of real irritation, 
[01:24:00]  it's usually a benign condition that, you know, unless it's really bothering him,  he can live with it.  Because, like I said, they do have a surgical procedure, but most people are not doing it.  That's called the Jim Brewer diagnosis, which is walk it off, dick.  Wow, that's pretty amazing.  All right.  Well, that's what I got.  He's sweating profusely on the right side of his face and dry on the left.  Well, you ate like two wings.  Yeah.  I can tell him.  Do you sweat on your whole body that way or is it just your face?  You know what?  I don't think so. 
[01:24:30]  Like do you get wet under both arms?  That's why I'm sweaty.  Let me see.  Because of my forehead.  It's mostly the face and the underarms.  Right.  It usually just affects the face.  All right.  It usually just affects the face.  It can also affect, like, feet.  Certain people complain that, you know, one foot is sweaty.  How about that?  Right guard, right?  Yeah.  Right guard and left guard.  There you go.  All right.  All right.  Well, there you go.  Go have it checked out maybe.  But doctor said cool and that's bizarre.  Rocks, which is something you always want to hear from a doctor.  Heath, you rock.  Yeah.  That was something.  We might have to invite you to the next road show. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  We'll just have you get on stage with some cool lighting on your head and have you eat  some wings.  That would be cool.  All right.  Rick, what else do we have?  You got the list in front of you there, Oak.  Did you add to it or no?  Yeah.  We just added one guy, Mel.  Mel.  Oh, another guy with a growth.  Okay.  I think we have to take a break before we get to John that has something that's leaking.  Oh, God.  We have Mel.  Is this leaking?  Mel has a golf ball growth.  That's all I'll say.  Oh, God.  And ladies and gentlemen, Sandy Kane has entered the grand finale. 
[01:25:30]  Yes.  The grand finale.  We will finally put an end to the mystery.  What is Twato?  And we will do that before six o'clock.  Definitely.  Yeah.  Okay.  Because the hot doctor, Allison, has to get out of here by, I think, 530 or so.  So we'll do it before 530 even.  Yeah.  We could go to the FU line and we'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, thanks for calling and here's the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Yeah.  I'd like to send a big FU after all my so-called friends in Cranford, New Jersey.  Bunch of God's being washed women.  Phony losers.  And they've lost like seven times a day for eternity there. 
[01:26:00]  Jerks.  Next message.  Yeah, this big FU goes out to my non-linear video editing program, which f***ing crashed  on me after three hours of freaking work.  F*** you.  I lost everything.  Next message.  I want to give a big f*** you to whoever is that stupid ass that took my book, that  stole my book bag out of my Jeep last night.  I now have nothing to study for for my finals next week here at Rutgers.  So f*** you, you ass. 
[01:26:30]  End of message.  Alien Ant Farm.  Movies.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  We're hanging out with a bunch of doctors today, Anthony.  Goddamn Norton, man.  During breaks, he finds the most disgusting picture in the book, and I'm like reading over  copy or instant feedbacks or whatnot, and he goes, hey, Ant.  And I'll turn my head, and he's just holding it right up, so I got it.  Look.  Bastard.  Disgusting.  The medical book is chock full of, I'm not looking. 
[01:27:00]  No.  That's the best picture in the book right there.  We should take a snapshot of that and put it on the website.  It's not nasty.  It's just weird.  It's like, what?  No, that's nasty and weird, dude.  I didn't even know what it was supposed to be.  It's junk.  That used to be junk, Anthony.  Tony from Jersey.  I'd like to play skin tag with Dr. Allison.  Very funny.  The listener's digging.  Dr. Allison from Temptation Island. 
[01:27:30]  And you guys are okay, too.  We had a couple more people come down.  Yeah, I'm waiting for them to give me the list.  That's great.  I guess we could invite John in, who has something leaking from his body.  Something leaking?  I don't like the sound of that.  Oh, that's awesome.  The gloves are being passed back around.  Some more latex gloves being put on by the doctors.  These doctors are good, because some of the people coming in, Anthony, they're like,  I don't need a glove. 
[01:28:00]  I know what it is.  But then when you say something leaking, they run for the gloves.  Oh, the gloves just come out.  Hey, John, what's up?  Not looking at all.  How are you doing?  Where are you from, man?  Queens.  Cool.  Just to clarify, it doesn't leak on its own.  I have to squeeze it.  I thought it was a pimple, but then it turned out it wasn't.  Holy Christ.  I have this other thing on my arm.  I call it the drug bump.  There's only one thing at each visit.  Yeah, that's how it works.  Yes, yes.  You've got to come back.  What did we bill for a visit?  Another copay. 
[01:28:30]  All right, Mike.  A copay.  What's the thing on your arm?  It's like a bump.  I don't know.  Like, when I drink a lot, like the next day, it puffs out.  So I thought it was a tick.  So I got Lyme's disease.  It's like it sucked the blood and got bigger.  When you drink.  But I don't know.  I never got to check that.  All right.  Maybe when you're dehydrated, it shows up more.  That could be what the drink is.  You're drinking alcohol.  Well, there's nothing on your arm right now, though.  No, it's like right below the surface.  You can feel it.  All right.  They're feeling his arm, Anthony.  The inside is like the elbow.  A little red bump. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, they're already waving it off like it's nothing.  It's not well-circumscribed.  It's not what?  It's not well-circumscribed.  Oh, scribed.  Yeah.  You can feel the edges of it distinctly.  Right.  I don't think.  Is that good or bad?  It's not well-demarcated.  Is that good or bad?  It's not demarcated.  How big does it get?  It puffs up a little bit like a mosquito bite.  Oh, really?  Maybe it just sticks out.  Let's see the lead.  Oh, we're talking about the thing on his arm.  Where's the leaky thing?  Get to the leaky thing. 
[01:29:30]  Well, the leaky thing is the chest, Anthony.  It's only on one side.  I don't know.  To make you funny, you can draw a bullseye on a piece of paper.  I don't know, like, the last time I touched it and drained it in the shower, but I probably  could drain it.  No, no, no.  Please, let's not shoot anything.  No, he's got to shoot.  No, no.  Not in this close proximity to people.  Hit the board over there.  No.  People are working here.  Anthony, it's for the show.  Look, if he's going to do something, I want plastic.  I want...  How about you...  Rick, hold up newspapers or something. 
[01:30:00]  I can hold up a paper.  Put him over there in the corner, though, to do it.  Exactly.  All right.  So, John...  We'll see.  Well, I don't care.  Look at all the lights.  Maybe you can cover us in plastic and Gallagher can hit it with a mallet.  Before you squeeze it.  No squeezing yet.  Don't squeeze anything yet.  All right.  He's showing the area.  Is that there or does it come out of there?  This is the worst show.  Oh.  Those are sweat glands there, too.  Go, let's see.  All right.  They get filled sometimes. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, my God.  He's going to squirt something in a cup.  Hold on.  I'm not looking.  Wait.  Move out of the way, Doc.  All right.  He's...  He's...  Oh, boy!  Oh, yeah!  Hold on.  That was disgusting.  I think there's some right here.  Wow.  That was disgusting.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Okay.  That was impressive.  That was impressive.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  My God. 
[01:31:00]  Anthony, describe that.  It's always the same one.  It's always the same one.  Do that.  Do it again.  Do it again.  Do it again.  No.  Oh, that's all you have in there?  No.  This is disgusting.  He's got to reload.  He's reloading.  Oh, now it just kind of wah, wah, wah, wah.  It's a money shot out of his nip.  Yeah.  Is what I'm saying.  But milk says, yeah, but the milk comes from all over, not just in the mail.  Why are they saying milk?  It's a shit. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, God.  I am so frigging disgusted.  That's exactly right.  There are three doctors.  Doctors, what's up?  Yeah, it shouldn't.  Do you take any medicines?  Are you crazy?  Do you take psych medicine?  Sometimes people on psych medicine can get it and stuff.  It's called galactorrhea.  Galactorrhea.  I love that movie.  It was clear.  It didn't look milk-colored.  It's gross, but I have tasted it.  It's salty.  Oh, my God.  What are you, crazy?  What are you, insane?  And it tastes salty. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  Why would you taste that?  It's curious.  I don't know.  The first time I noticed it, I was like 14.  Does it have to refill?  And then, like, you can't just do it again?  Yeah.  That's probably sweat, but you need to take that.  It takes a while to come back.  It reloads, yeah.  It's salty.  That's a sweat gland.  That's what you think it is.  You know, my own sometimes.  I'm just kidding.  Well, tell us more.  Yeah.  But that's a sweat.  Do you think it's a sweat gland as opposed to milk coming out of it?  Hold on.  Can I?  My observation, though, they're saying it was clear.  I didn't see clear. 
[01:32:30]  I saw it.  It was milky.  Oh, God.  I want that cleaned up with Lysol.  It's got, like, a yellowish tint to it.  It's not Lysol.  It's not bloody.  No, it's not bloody either.  Stinky.  How impressive was that?  It was so disgusting.  Jesus Christ, man.  Hey, where did Ben go?  Ben left.  Oh, my God.  Ben is probably vomiting if he even heard that.  Didn't we make a bet that Ben would leave the show by five?  Yes.  Well, all right.  I have had it checked out once before, and they told me it's from smoking pot. 
[01:33:00]  No.  No.  That was the anti-pot people saying that.  Smoke all the pot you want.  Stinky will smoke somebody.  One more time.  No, no, no, no.  No.  Did you guys get that on video, Steve?  Yes.  Steve got it on video.  It will be up on foundrymusic.com.  That was cool.  The other one's on the website.  You can get that through opiateathlete.com.  You know, people are enjoying the hell out of Stinky Cam, and Brandon from New Hampshire  is checking in.  He said he just saw Dr. Allison on the Stinky Cam, and now he has a growth he wants her  to check out.  So. 
[01:33:30]  She's a trooper, though.  She comes in with a hot leather top, but she's very professional, too.  She's looking at the problems these people have, and she's giving her opinion on what  it could be, and that's pretty cool.  There's a little inside joke in the studio about the couch.  I had thought about it real quick before I sat down, and then the guy from the Navy came  in and was like, I wouldn't be sitting there.  No, no.  No, that's the other thing.  It's more of your own couch.  There's more diseases on that couch than on Stinky Cam.  Trust me, my friend.  I'm not too worried about getting any diseases from it.  You should see what has gone on on that couch. 
[01:34:00]  It's just about when you go around in public, though.  I mean, you know.  You know what?  We've seen some crazy sites so far today, Anthony.  Yeah.  John is the best so far.  Yeah, that just went flying out.  Can I give my friend a band plug?  Of course.  All right, downpour.com.  Everybody check it out.  It's a good band.  Nice.  Local band from Queens.  They should rename the band Leaky You Know What.  Downpour.  They named it after them, yeah.  Oh, my God.  That is something.  All right.  So, what are the doctors saying?  Do you think you should have that checked out?  I would still get it checked out.  It's likely nothing, but there is a serious condition that can arise. 
[01:34:30]  I'm going to be playing around with something along those lines.  Right, right.  The old tumor in the head.  It's always best to be safe than sorry.  He's had it for a really long time, too.  Yeah.  Since 14, right?  Yeah.  All right.  That's why I thought the first doctor was right, because that's about the same time I  started smoking.  And, John, don't drink it anymore.  Yeah, yeah.  Please, keep it out of your mouth.  Hey, but for that other contest, the cannibal contest, somebody wants to drink it.  Oh, God.  Well, we might have to have you come down and offer the beverage for the people. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, we'll put it in fresh.  We'll put it in the cannibal stew.  That would be amazing.  Oh, God.  I am so friggin' disgusted.  Let me go to Doug from Springfield.  Doug, what's up?  Oh, you guys are nasty.  This is better than stacker, too.  I lost my appetite.  Later, guys.  Doug, how did that sound on the radio?  It went flying across the studio.  Oh.  He just squeezed it a little bit and bing.  Did it smell like blue cheese dressing?  Oh, God.  Stop it.  You want to play now, right?  Stop it.  No, I don't want to play.  Hey, guys.  Stop it.  All right.  Bye. 
[01:35:30]  And Lisa has a question for the doctors on the line.  Lisa, what's up?  Yeah.  Listen, I got to know my regular gynecologist about this.  I have a white discharge, and it has a fishy smell.  I think it's the vaginosis thing.  My doctor keeps telling me it's either a yeast infection or nothing.  Yeah.  And I feel bad for my boyfriend, you know?  I mean, he's too nice to say anything to me.  And, you know, I just want to know.  Yeah, I know.  We were just talking to him.  What? 
[01:36:00]  Sorry.  Oh, no.  And I just want to know, like, what antibiotic I should ask for.  Flagyl.  It depends what it is.  I mean, if it's trichomonas, then you treat it with flat.  Well, you can just flagyl for B.  Flagyl for all.  Yeah.  But it, you know, it might not.  You don't know necessarily what it is.  And if it, a lot, we used to have a lot of people come in with a white discharge.  They thought we were worried about it, and we would test it, pH test it, look at it in a microscope.  And it really was nothing.  And it's hard to convince people that sometimes it is nothing. 
[01:36:30]  Sometimes it's nothing.  Sometimes it's, so that can be normal?  It's not normal.  A white discharge, yeah, it just, it doesn't seem normal, you know?  It's incredibly foul-smelling.  You're a girl.  Yeah, foul-smelling's not.  But white, just having a discharge in and of itself is not abnormal.  You have to ask your doctor to do, and I'm not kidding you, it's called the whiff test.  They take the discharge.  The whiff test?  Yeah, the whiff test.  You put it on a slide and drop potassium hydroxide on it and smell it. 
[01:37:00]  You're a girl.  Anthony, I just figured something out.  Yeah.  Allison's actually a doctor.  Oh, yeah.  I thought she was faking it, bro.  Yeah, sure.  That's great.  All right, well, John, you rock.  Lisa, thank you.  Thanks, man.  All right.  Good luck.  Oh, man.  Well, who's next?  All right.  Who's next on the list?  Mel?  We going with Melly Mel?  Yeah.  Mel.  Mel has, I think, the golf ball growth. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, oh, oh.  But it's not on you-know-what, Anthony.  It's right?  Melly Mel?  It's just below.  Where are you from, Melly Mel?  Brooklyn.  Brooklyn.  I'm in Manhattan.  Nice.  Oh, there you go.  You seem like a happy guy.  Yes, I am.  That's good.  And you got some little problem there, huh?  Yes, I got a bit of a golf ball-sized growth right here on my air side.  Oh, oh!  There's a little bit of a load in the airbag.  Dude, I got to be careful because, I mean, you're a black guy.  I thought you were grabbing your- 
[01:38:00]  No, no, no, no.  I'm grabbing his junk.  No, Mike was holding that out the other way.  Yo, man.  And I was thinking, well, I'm pretty impressive because it's halfway down his leg, but it's  a whole different thing going on.  Yes, sir.  Okay, go ahead.  Let the doctors take a look there.  Okay, dokey.  Excuse me while I whip this out.  How long have you been there?  It's been there for quite a while, over a year.  Getting bigger, slowly?  No, I think that's not terribly.  Wow.  Excuse me while I whip this out.  Not at all.  Not a drop.  Okay, and you want to describe that? 
[01:38:30]  I'm not looking, okay.  You describe it.  It's more than a golf ball size.  That's probably, that could be a vascular, or a vascular growth, the way it's-  What would that mean?  It's not well circumscised, but it can be a lipoma.  A vascular-  A lipoma.  Circum what?  No, no.  Lipoma is rock.  Does it ever get bigger when you're doing anything in particular?  Are you talking about the growth now, or the other thing?  I'm talking about the growth.  Okay.  Wow.  Okay, it's not very- 
[01:39:00]  It's shaped like, again, if I may bring up Rocky Dennis' head.  It's not very-  It's not like round.  It's not smooth.  It's got many little bumps on it.  It's halfway up his inner thigh, Anthony.  It's not like encapsulated or anything like that.  Do you think it's like blood vessels in there?  It seems more vascular in nature.  Yes, yes.  Blood vessels can actually grow awry and form kind of what he has in his thigh.  It's more likely that than a lipoma.  What's a lipoma?  A lipoma is like fatty tissue growth. 
[01:39:30]  A soft, benign growth.  You need to go get an ultrasound done.  They'll take a sound probe against it, and they'll tell you exactly what it is.  See if it's a boy or a girl.  The ultrasound.  It's a probe, but you'll see if it's hollow.  Is it soft, that thing?  Yeah, very soft.  No, very soft.  We never know what we're talking about here, do we?  Wow, that's something.  And how long have you had that going?  About a year.  About a year?  Yes.  Never at all.  It's not painful.  Does it get in the way or anything?  No, not at all. 
[01:40:00]  And did it start out small, and all of a sudden it just, or one day you woke up and went,  whoa!  It just, it was, geez.  It's like that Ray Moland, Rosie Greer thing.  I just woke up one day and there it was.  Ray Moland's head or Rosie Greer's head.  Exactly.  Yeah, I hear you.  How long have you had it?  About a year.  Yeah, you said it a little over a year.  Hmm.  So, is it serious, doctors?  Get it checked out, especially if it's grown that large that fast.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:40:30]  And the fact that it's no pain does, okay.  It doesn't mean...  Just to get it checked out.  I understand.  Get that checked out, my friend, with the ultrasound.  Will do.  I'd like to re-robe now.  Yeah, yeah, please, pick up your pants.  You're insulting all of us white people, ain't it?  Jesus.  Jesus.  Wow, we actually have what he's going to sound like at the doctor's office.  Hold on.  Oh, oh, help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Somebody help me.  Help me.  Help me.  I love Blazing Saddles. 
[01:41:00]  All right, Mel, you rock.  All right, thanks a lot.  Thank you.  Wow.  That was pretty impressive.  Well, there you go.  You had it and I told him you should get it checked out.  It was way more than a golf ball.  Yeah, that looked like a green.  The golf ball, the green, everything, a little lumpy.  He's a goner.  Oh, God.  Look at the doctor's now.  He's a goner.  Can it be serious, though?  No, I'm just kidding.  No, no.  No, most likely not.  Well, I think you might have scared him a little bit, so maybe you should tell him that. 
[01:41:30]  He needs this.  He needs to get checked out.  Well, of course.  Anything like that, you should get checked out.  Anything that grows to that size in one year.  I mean, yeah.  It's a year he's had.  Yeah.  If you had that for 15 years, it's one thing.  But, I mean, look at the size of that thing.  Yeah.  All right.  Someone wants to know if I can hit that into Central Park, Anthony.  Give it a whirl.  Yeah.  All right.  Rick, what's next?  We've got three people left on the list.  We've got Anthony, Pete, and Sandy Kane.  Oh, boy.  Can I see the list? 
[01:42:00]  Sure.  Now, I'm hoping this one person showed up.  The cauliflower one?  Not yet.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  All right.  Let's bring in Anthony.  We can keep going.  What does he have?  He has rotting corneas, Anthony.  What?  Yes.  Yes.  What do you have?  I have rotting corneas.  Rotting corneas?  How old are you?  21.  And what is a rotting cornea?  Exactly what is that? 
[01:42:30]  It's a rotting cornea.  Some kind of a, um...  They're pulling out their flashlights out.  They got their flashlights out.  Take a look at your...  By the way, we have like four or five doctors in the studio.  Yeah.  You have scarring on your cornea?  Yeah.  How did that happen?  Is it a herpetic infection?  Oh, who?  Hey, hey, you can get that.  Well, that's the first thing that comes to mind.  I hear you.  Get more of yours.  Scarlet fever.  Scarlet fever?  What is it?  In the 1800s?  You had scarlet fever.  She got the scarlet fever.  All right, hold on.  They're taking a look.  All the doctors are taking a look. 
[01:43:00]  Do you wear contacts?  No.  Not changing?  No.  How's your eyesight overall?  Horrible.  Horrible.  Especially when you shine lights.  What eyes are low without my glasses?  I can't believe it.  Wait, do you have bad eyesight, but you can see with glasses fine?  Eh, kind of.  And my shoes.  My shoes.  I'm smiling.  I'm putting my shoes down.  There's so many things that can do that.  There's about five different viral infections.  There's something called Warren's ulcers that eat away your eye. 
[01:43:30]  I've had this scar on my eye for like years and years and years.  I went into the Navy, and they, you know, gave me a full exam.  And they just like, all right, you have this, this, and this.  Sorry, we have to kick you out.  Oh, boy.  I was in like two weeks of boot camp.  Got kicked out.  I was so pissed off.  Oh, and you'd have been perfect for killing some of those Afghanis over there.  MFers.  Oh, you'd be shooting.  You can't see anyone.  Ha, ha, Magoo.  I'm shooting my own people, Magoo.  You've done it again. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, my Georgie Magoo.  So, Docs, what's going on?  His corneas are rotting away.  This is something I believe you should go to a specialist for.  Right to an eye.  You've got to go to an ophthalmologist because some things you can treat with antibiotics.  Some things need steroids.  Some things you just kiss that eye goodbye.  Is it one eye or both?  It's soon to be both.  They noticed in my right eye, too.  Well, we should bring in Blind Dave so he can give you some pointers.  Yes, yes.  I saw an ophthalmologist.  And what did he tell you was the problem?  She diagnosed me with, it's got the name of it, Terrian's Corneal Dystrophy. 
[01:44:30]  Tergium's different.  It's not a tergium.  That's on a sclera.  No.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  That's what I was thinking, man.  That's what I was thinking.  I know.  That was my diagnosis.  There's a lot of specialized eye hospitals at, you know, Will's Eye in Philly or something  that, yeah, Manhattan Eye in the area.  Yeah, you know, it's kind of hard to talk with, especially the eye.  You know what I mean?  It's not like a, I think you go to a specialist, yeah.  Maybe you go to a specialist there and have that dealt with immediately. 
[01:45:00]  Where do you live?  I live in America.  I don't have insurance, though.  That's the whole thing.  Hey, where do you live?  A communist country there?  You go in and you take care of it?  You don't pay it?  I work in a freaking house.  They get paid anyway.  They get their money from the government somehow.  Well, if you go to one of the teaching hospitals in town, I'm sure that they can kind of set  you up in one of the clinics, and they would be real interested in seeing your kids.  So I have like 50 million people looking in my eye, tearing my eye.  Well, if they treat you.  Teaching hospitals, yeah.  I went through that once.  I mean, I don't need to go through it again.  But if they can help you. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, what are you going to do?  The other alternative.  You've got to come up with a pile of cash.  Go blind, I mean.  Hey, our hot doctor's looking at her watch like she's got to go.  Yeah.  We should probably.  Well, we've got enough doctors that I could do the Santa Cain.  Yeah.  Because we've got to get the other peed on.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  So what's your final thoughts with this guy, Doc?  Immediately to an eye doctor.  All right.  Absolutely, ophthalmologist, ASAP.  One of the teaching hospitals would probably be able to, you know, work on that best.  So, you know, put them in dress and whatnot. 
[01:46:00]  What do you want, a referral?  Do you think we're from New York or something?  Dude, dude, here's what you do.  Here's what you do.  You go to an eye doctor, right?  You tell them, bill me.  And you don't pay.  Right?  Yeah, yeah.  Been there, done that.  Been there, done that.  You guys see how that happens, right?  You've got to help.  It's part of the, it's one of the parts of being a doctor.  Sometimes you're going to get screwed on the bill because people need help.  Yeah.  Like a restaurant.  Yeah, like a restaurant.  Yeah, sometimes I can't afford the food.  I just leave.  Just walk up, you eat the meal, then you walk up to the bathroom, then you leave. 
[01:46:30]  Like, oops.  All right, should we, let's get Pete in here.  Yeah.  All right, thank you.  Go to an eye doctor immediately.  Immediately.  Is that guy after what?  He's gone now.  Is he after?  He's going to be gone, right?  Oh, look at him all night.  Great.  If that's, if that's HSV or CMV or Morrin's ulcer, that's just going to run away without  therapy.  Oh, my God.  He's got to take care of that immediately.  Oh, yes.  David Wells just entered the studio.  Oh, wow. 
[01:47:00]  Everybody says that.  Yeah, you do look like David Wells.  I just wish I had the women he had.  Yeah.  Oh, by the way, Lori was on the line, the black guy, Mel, that came in from Brooklyn.  Yeah.  Yeah, it did look like a potato.  Yeah, yeah.  Kind of a potato right under the skin.  Right under the skin.  Soft potato.  Soft potato.  Mask butt in the tongue.  I don't believe it.  It's a nut potato.  Pete, what's going on?  I got this thing on my jaw, like right here on like the labial side, you know, it's just  a lump, you know, it's not on the other side, it's on this side. 
[01:47:30]  It's a big round ball.  It didn't bother me at all until I was like sitting and waiting for the train.  I licked underneath my lip.  I'm like, what the hell is that?  Now it's been pirated.  Do you dip?  Do you chew?  Do you chew?  Do you chew?  I smoke.  You smoke.  Oh, oh.  Oh, boy.  Could this be our first one?  How long have you had it?  Take a look.  The big casino, Tony.  Yeah.  I first noticed it a week ago.  It's the first time I noticed it.  It's the big casino, Tony.  Don't say that.  Well, why don't you stop smoking?  No, it doesn't hurt.  There's no pain. 
[01:48:00]  But now I know it's there, so it's bothering me.  Right.  You know?  Is it white?  Yes.  Oh, Jesus.  Lord.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Wow.  All right.  They're going to take a look.  Oh, boy.  The tongue depressors and flashlights are coming out.  Many gloved fingers going towards his mouth.  He just said, Jesus, Lord.  Oh, Jesus, Lord.  It's never good.  Well, Richard Dreyfuss called us.  All right.  He's sitting down. 
[01:48:30]  They're making him sit down.  Oh, my God.  He's sitting.  They're all around him with flashlights, tongue depressors, and fingers.  They're all taking a look.  He looks so scared right now.  Take a look.  Uh-oh.  All right.  Let's all take a deep breath.  They're taking a look.  Oh, wow.  What is it?  Oh, my God.  I see what I mean.  What is it?  Lift the tongue up more.  It's right there.  Oh.  Oh, there it is.  What is it?  You got to touch it.  All right.  He's going to touch it.  Someone's got to touch it.  Someone's got to touch it.  He's got to get their fingers.  It's hard as a rock. 
[01:49:00]  It's hard as a rock.  Yeah.  It's hard.  Oh, open it up.  Yeah.  You got to get that.  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  I don't want to come.  No, it's right here.  You can't see it from where you're at.  It's not painful, but now that I know it's in.  I feel it.  It's not painful.  I know it's in now.  That is like something.  All right.  The looks that the doctors have given are not good.  Oh, my God.  That isn't good.  They're all in his mouth.  It was all fun and games. 
[01:49:30]  It was all fun and games until someone has the big casino.  Yeah, but that's not what that is.  That's...  What is it?  What?  Oh, my God.  The doctor is just like shaking his head, kind of like, uh-oh, uh-oh.  Oh, don't say anything.  Don't say anything.  You guys doctors a lot.  How long have you been smoking, sir?  20 years you've been smoking?  You want to get your hand in there?  Oh, my God.  Since I'm 18, I'm 34 now. 
[01:50:00]  16 years of smoking.  16 years of smoking.  This...  Oh, my God.  Okay, uh...  Oh, my God.  Let's get...  Let's get some shippers down here immediately.  Where's Dr. Kennedy?  They're still alive, then.  Oh, my God.  Hell, this seemed like a good idea in the back.  Golf is...  Holy Jesus.  The one guy who doesn't even want to be part of it. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, boy.  The one doctor that's given up.  Oh, boy.  Huh?  Other side.  Oh, boy.  Other side?  Other side of the gum, labial side.  Grab that mic.  What do you think?  When in doubt, cut it out.  When in doubt, cut it out?  Oh, my God.  Cancer?  Over this leg.  Other side, labial side.  Other side, like, in...  Have you quit smoking since you discovered it?  It's in his gum, like it's inside of his teeth.  Oh, hold on.  Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  Open his mouth.  They're, like, really getting in there. 
[01:51:00]  Uh-uh.  The flashlights.  I could see it in a mirror.  Come on.  You're supposed to be a doctor?  Come on.  Oh, now he's auguring.  Oh, I see.  Ed, give him that mic.  This guy doesn't want in on it.  Doctor, doctor.  Get over here.  They can't hear it.  Talk a lot.  It's a solid mass inside of his mouth.  I mean, and it's growing in a smoker.  That's got to come out.  Number one diagnosis.  It's a big casino.  Yeah.  It's on the inside of it.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Oh.  Do you see it?  It's right in here. 
[01:51:30]  Okay.  Okay.  You got it.  He doesn't want anything.  Uh-oh.  The doctor's feeling it.  You need to have that checked.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  If you check it.  What do you think?  That's why people shouldn't smoke.  Right.  Have you stopped smoking?  No.  I have no smoking.  Why don't you just throw those goddamn things away?  Because I felt it on the platform of the LAOR yesterday.  Well, see?  Very good now.  Very good.  I started smoking heavy worrying about it.  So you started smoking heavy to get all your smoking in now. 
[01:52:00]  Have that checked out immediately.  Well, what is it?  We can't say exactly what it is, but it definitely needs to be seen by an ENT.  By who?  By who?  Ear, nose, and throat specialist.  Okay.  Someone who can properly diagnose you with exactly what it is.  I have good coverage.  I need to know who I need to see about that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you have a primary care doctor?  No, I do not, but I have good coverage with Empire.  I have coverage.  Oh, Jesus.  Okay.  Because you need to go to your primary care doctor, wherever you're assigned to. 
[01:52:30]  Oh, my God.  Let him see that, and he'll make the arrangements and put a sentence in.  What the hell's the project?  What do you think it is?  There could be a lot of things that...  Could be a lot of things.  ...you know, that come to mind, but it's something that needs to be looked at.  How about we get the top three?  Especially being a smoker.  Especially being a smoker, my friend.  See?  You've got to throw those away.  They're very bad for you.  Why are they all giving the C sign?  What is the C sign?  Tankersore.  Tankersore.  No.  You don't have any. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, of course not.  I mean, once you hear that somebody's a smoker, especially if they drink, too, you worry that  they have a cancer in their neck, because most times that cancers occur in smokers.  That's fat.  Well, that's the first thing that came to my mind.  So that's what you worry about, and it might not be.  I figure they have to take a hack store and cut, like, half my face.  No, no.  What you do now is kind of checked out of me.  We don't know what it is.  You need to go get it checked out.  I figure the worst, you know?  Well, better to figure the worst, and then you'll be a...  Doctor with, like, a sawzall just cutting my jaw.  No, no.  Listen, there's a lot of new type of treatments where they may not even have to do surgery on you, 
[01:53:30]  but it's the type of thing that it needs to be evaluated quickly.  Stereotactic radiosurgery.  There is absolutely no way we can say what that is, but what needs to be done is called a biopsy.  They'll just take a little tiny piece of the tissue.  There's no sawzall.  You're not going to lose your jaw, and then they send that off to the pathologist  that comes back and tells you it's nothing, it's something, and then the treatment from there is a...  That's well and good.  That's well and good.  What if it's something?  I need to know who I go to right now that I got this big lump in my jaw. 
[01:54:00]  What type of doctor do I go to tomorrow?  It's called ear, nose, and throat, E-N-T.  Ear, nose, and throat.  Not doctor.  I have an ear, nose, and throat guy.  That's who you have to go see.  He's going to say, I don't know what the hell that is.  No, no.  Then he's not a good doctor.  He knows something.  He'll take care of it.  He'll, like you said, do a biopsy.  Who specializes in this type of thing?  We're telling you.  We're telling you.  Ear, nose, and throat.  Ear, nose, throat.  Pete, you're going to get this looked at immediately, right?  I'm diagnosing him as death.  Yeah, tomorrow.  Well, I've got to work tomorrow. 
[01:54:30]  It's on Monday.  Ear, nose, throat.  All right.  That's who you need to go to.  All right.  We're not going to properly, you know, we're not going to give you a specific diagnosis.  Right, right.  You need to go to a specialist, someone who will be able to, like the other physician  said, take a biopsy.  In your professional opinion, if you had to be, like, if you had to be quizzed on it, what  would you say that would be?  He can't.  All I can say is, I'm glad I, not you.  Five things come to mind with that, and like I said, one of the things could be a malignancy.  One thing.  What would we write on it as a diagnostic code?  It would be a mass in the mouth. 
[01:55:00]  We wouldn't write exactly what it was today.  Mass.  If it were an office, because we don't know.  What would you write on my death certificate?  How you missed a mass.  Well, we wouldn't have a biopsy by then.  We wouldn't have a biopsy.  On Black Earl's chart, they wrote ass.  That was kind of close to mass, but.  Dude.  We can't.  You can't know without doing a biopsy.  Dude, yeah, like they said, go to a specialist, and you know something?  This could be very good.  You came down here on a whim.  You check it out.  Now, people are telling you to check it out before you know it.  I have to turn the lights off on my electrician.  Before you know it, you could have it taken care of, and all of a sudden, it's like, wow, 
[01:55:30]  geez, a good thing you caught that in time.  There you go.  I was sitting there.  I was bored.  I called up.  I was listening.  All right.  Well, good thing you did, my friend.  Thanks for having this.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, Pete.  No problem.  I think we have to say goodbye to the hot doctor, Allison.  Yes, Allison.  Thank you so much for coming down.  Sandy Cain's about to come.  And, Rick, are you insane after what we just went through?  We need to take a break and regroup, it's called.  Even we're smart enough to realize that. 
[01:56:00]  West Coast Dave said you just made 12 million people stop smoking.  Well, you want to know the truth?  Look at this one.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Let me tell you guys, I am so glad that you did this bit today.  Why?  I am going to stop smoking, stop drinking, get on the right diet, and God forbid, no offense,  I never have to be on this cringe radio that you are doing today.  All right.  Thank you, Chris.  Sure.  All right.  Bye. 
[01:56:30]  Bye.  I was just going to, like, I don't know.  All right.  The hot doctor, Allison, has to get out of here.  We're going to regroup, Anthony.  That's a good one.  And we're going to wrap up this ridiculous bit with Sandy Cain, and we're going to finally  find out what TWATO is.  And we will do that next.  All right.  It's very uncomfortable in here right now.  Now let's turn on the PA system and start the fun.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Afternoon radio.  This is it. 
[01:57:00]  You can't go anywhere else.  Nowhere to go.  That's like saying you don't like Earth.  You're leaving.  Where are you going?  O.P. and Anthony.  And we finally have control.  Yes.  Gets better every day, don't it?  I feel like there's many things wrong with my body now.  I got the heat and the heat.  People are quitting smoking all over the country now that we're syndicated.  Good thing.  And well, they should.  No joke, man.  That last guy was the real deal.  Something is going on with him, and he needs to be checked out immediately. 
[01:57:30]  Hopefully, he will get checked out.  We had no official diagnosis, but the doctors were all pretty much shaking their heads.  The hot doctor said, I'm not touching it.  Wow.  All right.  Glenn, what's going on?  Yeah, that was the freakiest radio I've heard in my entire life.  My heart's still going a mile a minute.  Yeah, it was very...  I've never been more uncomfortable in my life.  Seriously.  To see the doctors' faces turn from, hey, we're all having fun and making cute little doctor jokes. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, my God.  We were hoping we wouldn't see one of these today.  That was great.  And I quit smoking a year ago today, or tomorrow, actually.  I realized that after that happened, and I'm just like, I'll never go back.  You know what?  You're going to smoke or what?  Yeah, man.  This is it.  No, no, you're done.  I'm telling you.  He pulled one cigarette out of his pack of cigarettes, threw the rest of the pack away, and he goes, that's it.  I'm just having this one.  I'm done. 
[01:58:30]  But it's like when you quit, you've got to just throw them the half of them.  If people quit on New Year's Day, they make a goal for themselves, and there are no guys  that have done it.  I don't believe it.  I've been sure I've done it.  How long have you been smoking?  About 15 years.  And that's what...  And you saw...  I've been wanting to quit for a long time.  But you just saw what was going on in the studio, and that was it.  I don't even know what's wrong with that guy, but it's just like their faces, and I'm  like, you know what, man?  Enough.  Enough.  Enough.  I quit drinking.  I quit getting high.  Enough.  Done.  Man, I'm walking.  That's it.  No more.  What about Stinky?  What?  He's young.  Young smoker.  I don't know. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah.  There he goes.  I'm young.  You want nothing else?  I'm young.  No, don't even look at...  Oh, God.  Don't look at Stinky.  Don't look.  Don't even look.  You might see traces of mule juice, but nothing else.  And what about you?  You do the smoking every once in a while?  You go on stages?  No, I'm done.  What are you kidding?  No, you haven't been a long, long time.  I'm done.  I throw them away, and that's it.  Done.  That's it.  Oof.  Do you take anything, or do you just stop?  Just stop.  Throw the goddamn pack away, and then when you go to light up, and you have the cigarette 
[01:59:30]  in your hand, and you go to put it in your mouth, you don't wake up out of a haze and  go, oh, my God, there's a cigarette burning in my mouth.  It's a conscious decision that you make.  Yeah.  So, guys, what do you think, now that the guy's out of the studio?  Seriously.  Dude.  This is just, you know, your opinions.  I mean, you got to be concerned that the number one diagnosis is cancer.  Cancer is the answer.  Tumor is the rumor.  So, don't go back down.  Oh, my God.  I don't like that rhyme.  And it's in a bad place, too, right?  Yeah. 
[02:00:00]  The head and neck cancer is not a good one at all.  It just spreads very quickly.  Ah!  Some of the surgeries involved in having to remove those sorts of things are not pretty.  I'm going to go see my mommy tonight.  I need to suckle.  Oh, my God.  I can't take this.  You can just get that guy back.  Oh, my God.  I can't take this.  But him coming in might have been the best thing, because he might not have got that check  for another year.  Instead of coming in today and seeing your horrified faces.  This will be the last time we do this, because I don't know if we can handle this one. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah, right.  This might be the only time we do this.  Why don't we get back to some fun anomalies on some of these people?  I'm already hearing rumors about Twaddle, though, and that's not going to be fun either.  Oh, boy.  Just hearing rumors, Anthony.  They were showing me pictures.  Let's just put it that way.  Great.  Great.  You want to bring in Sandy Kay?  Why don't we do that?  Why don't we get, because we told people we were going to do it before six.  Yeah, we got to keep our promise for once.  Okay.  And anything else would be anticlimactic at this point.  Like, like, hey, no, I don't want to. 
[02:01:00]  Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.  And stupid us.  I'm glad I put my arm.  Hold on, hold on, Sandy.  I'm going to put my arm.  I'm going to turn her mic off, because that's the easiest way.  Stupid us.  I just quickly want to bring that guy in as fillers, they call in the radio biz.  That could have been a lifesaver right there.  But instead, he was the showstopper.  So we can do what we want.  She's talking to her dildo.  I'm sorry, but he gets very offended.  All right.  Because he loves you.  He loves you.  He loves Opian Anthony.  And, you know, he's so nervous to come on. 
[02:01:30]  And then you said, turn him off.  Sandy.  Sorry, Anthony.  Do you know who these are?  I've been waiting for this all my life.  They're throwing tongue depressors at her.  The doctors.  Man, you guys, they do listen to our show.  They've got a great bedside manner.  They're just throwing stuff at Sandy Kane.  They should have brought some needles out of that little metal box.  The Byron has a box.  I'm glad I brought you, dildo.  Sandy.  It's my protection.  Do you know who these gentlemen are, some of these people in the studio?  Well, the ones were in a coat.  Like, that looks like a guy from Roosevelt Hospital that I once got in a bathroom. 
[02:02:00]  I remember.  He was so cute.  I couldn't help it.  He was so cute.  Jesus.  So there wasn't a patient in a coma?  Anthony.  Sandy.  You know, yeah.  We have to explain Sandy in, like, 20 seconds to the new cities.  Sandy has a public access cable show.  Thank you.  And she was a dancer, a stripper, back in the older days of Times Square.  I did spa nightclub the other night.  I stripped.  What, just back of the place?  I lit up my breasts for Amanda Lepore's party. 
[02:02:30]  Look, I think I could do this a little quicker than Sandy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Back in the day, the old 42nd Street.  Which was like a year ago.  No, no.  It was back in the days before Giuliani, when you used to be able to.  A year ago, I worked at Show World.  Before Giuliani.  It's in the Triple Treat Theater.  The last time she stripped for money, Roy Campanella had legs.  You are awful, man.  God damn, is that great? 
[02:03:00]  Bravo.  Roy Campanella leg reference.  Bravo.  All right, so Sandy was a stripper.  She got her own cable show.  She's doing my own show.  Yeah, she does her own show.  I did spa nightclub the other night for 2,000 people.  She's a little, I'll just, I'll be nice, but I'm going to be honest.  She's a little older than we like our strippers.  Right?  Depends.  If you're blind, I look great.  She's had a tough life in some aspects.  Yeah, bring in the guy with the rod and corneas.  He'll think you're a supermodel.  She was gang raped by a bunch of Jewish gentlemen many years ago. 
[02:03:30]  And the doctors look like the guys that raped me.  Oh, there you go.  Look at her.  And we brought her here today because she has something growing.  And it is, let's just say it's on her very lower abdomen.  Yeah.  Let's just put it that way.  We believe it's some type of a wart.  Can we say it's on the grass?  Yeah, we could say that.  It's on the grass.  We believe it's some kind of a wart.  There's been speculation. 
[02:04:00]  We put the picture on the web.  But we figure, Sandy's getting upset now because since we've said this, people don't want to talk to her, touch her.  Hold on, hold on, Sandy.  I turned on your ear.  So now we're finally going to get this taken care of and have these doctors get their opinion.  It looks like an ear.  It looks like the ear that was grown on the back of that mouse genetically.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So why don't we just get this over with, Sandy?  I hope it's not very dead, you know?  Sandy.  I get scared.  Pull your...  What if I need an operation?  I hate that I have to say this.  Pull that down.  Can we check out the other side, too, doctors? 
[02:04:30]  You've seen it all, right?  She's got a roid that's really bad.  Yeah.  I don't think that's a roid.  I just ate Mexican food for you guys.  All right, why don't you show them the roid first, then?  Because that's the...  It really is a beautiful roid.  Yeah, show them the roid first.  Because I always see it on my own show.  I have a beautiful ass.  Can I say that?  Yeah, you can say that.  All right, show the doctors the roid first.  I'm going to take my undies off here.  No, no, no, no.  Did you guys just ask if that tumor was in a bad place?  Like there's a good place for an effing tumor. 
[02:05:00]  That's Joe from the east side.  Here goes Sandy.  Wait, you're going to show...  Who is this?  Stinky.  Oh, Stinky.  Stinky.  Stinky.  Show the roid first.  Empty, empty.  Show the roid first.  Show them the roids.  The roids.  This doctor's worse than Opie and Anthony.  There you go.  Oh.  Save Twato for the end.  I want you to do the roid first.  That's the big one.  You like the rear end?  You need an opening act before the headliner comes out.  That's funny.  All right, show the... 
[02:05:30]  Look at her.  Which doctor?  All right.  Show the rich boss.  Show the rich boss.  Show the rich boss.  That's awful.  I love you, boss.  Sandy.  She's so annoying.  Face your back.  Doctor smash.  Turn your back to the doctor.  There you go.  Now, pull that aside.  Pull it aside.  You're not doing an act for him.  You're in such a ham.  Thanks, guys.  I'm a strip right now.  Sandy, pull the thong aside.  There you go.  Now, look, doc.  What do you see? 
[02:06:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That's where Osama bin Laden's hiding, and that came.  That's not beautiful.  That may not be.  That may be Quato's cousin.  What is that?  That's what I thought.  What does that look like?  That might be Quato's cousin.  That's Quato's cousin.  All right.  And what do you think that might be?  Oh, I hope I write.  A wart.  You think it's a wart?  Wait, that's not a roid?  All right.  No, that's not a roid.  There is a roid in there.  Well, no, it's not a roid.  They're saying it's not a roid.  It's a roid, honey.  It's inside. 
[02:06:30]  Well, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, Sandy knows.  That could be the next person.  Three doctors are standing around with flashlights looking, but they know.  They don't know.  You know.  Well, you know.  When I said, you know, when, when.  No, definitely there is a definite hemorrhoid in there.  Well.  Because I was almost one to operate it on, so.  But, Sandy, there's something else that they're saying.  There's more than one thing.  Did I wipe?  No, it has nothing to do with that.  Stop.  They're going to dump it out.  Stop.  Stop.  Sandy.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  All right, Sandy, show them.  All right, so they're saying, Anthony, that they might be a cousin of Twata. 
[02:07:00]  Right.  Okay, here we go.  It's going to be some type of war thing.  Now, guys, get a load of this.  Okay, all right.  Pull it.  Pull it out.  Let's see it.  Look at that, guys.  Oh, man.  That's the doctor saying that.  Nuts.  Cousin of the other guy's skin.  What the hell is that?  We know.  You know?  They know.  Anthony?  They know.  Guys, what do you think?  We know with diagnostic certainty what that is.  What is it, guys?  Condyloma acuminata. 
[02:07:30]  Oh!  Otherwise known as cauliflower.  That is a large thing.  Oh, my God.  And the thing on the back is another one that is grown perirectally.  Oh, my God.  They'll lose it.  I'm back in the studio.  Pararectally.  Oh, my God.  Pararectally.  Oh, Jesus.  Perianal genital warts. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, my God.  Look, I need a shower.  Right now.  To prove this, I have brought photographic evidence that we're not kidding.  Oh, Sandy, look at the picture.  That's what you have.  Sandy, look at the picture.  That is what you have.  Look familiar?  Yes.  It looks like Sandy Kane.  Sandy, see?  We told you.  Now you've got to go.  Actually, the way you can find out for sure, 100%, and I know it sounds silly, is put a  little bit of vinegar on it, and it's going to blanch white because acetic acid reacts 
[02:08:30]  with the tissue, the warty tissue.  Can you use balsamic and maybe a little tasty?  These guys have no doubt, Anthony.  Is that contagious?  I think that is contagious.  You think you're bored with that?  No, and the plague isn't either.  Because that's a show event.  Yeah.  You got it many years ago.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, Sandy.  I mean, isn't there one, isn't there one, how do you say this?  Oh, closer to another area. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  Even closer.  Yeah, like.  There's something going on.  I don't even know how to say this.  If you open a door.  Right, right.  Okay, let's say, let's say, let's say you have something on the outside of the door in your  house, right?  You go to your house, there's something there that maybe you need a carpenter to come and  remove.  It's a growth on the wood outside the house.  Is it true, Sandy, that if this was your house, that if you opened the door and walked  in, there'd be something in the hallway also growing on the wall? 
[02:09:30]  She's looking at me like a fish out of goddamn water.  You're the only one that didn't get.  I'm just saying, so what do you do about it, doctor?  Shotgun with a toe attachment.  What do you do?  Can we remute?  Can we remove her tongue to cure it?  How do you get rid of something like that?  I give that recommendation.  When it gets that big, it's got to come off surgically.  When they're smaller, you can treat them.  There's a drug called Condilox that you can treat it with.  That size has got to be surgically removed. 
[02:10:00]  And then you may even need the medicine and it may recur.  But that definitely has to be treated surgically.  The bigger problem with it is that you're saying you had it for so long is that there's  certain serotypes of that.  It's the number one cause of cervical cancer.  So you've got to go, no kidding around.  Do you have a cervix?  You need to go get that checked out.  When was your last pap smear?  About before I was born.  I don't think I ever had one.  Let me tell you.  It was so long ago, the guy's name was Pap.  That did it.  It was actually Pap that did a pap himself. 
[02:10:30]  No kidding around.  You've got to go get a pap smear.  Can I tell a story?  Years ago, I went to Bellevue Hospital.  This female doctor, this is like 15 years ago, and she said something about that and  that, ooh, this is terrible and blah, blah, blah, blah, about cancer.  And then it was 15 years ago, and then they killed this particular doctor.  So I just, no, they killed, they murdered her at Bellevue Hospital.  So she couldn't have been right.  So I'm still living with this. 
[02:11:00]  She's dead and you're still alive.  How does that make it?  Yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying.  Oh, fuck.  What do you think, guys?  You think I should have to be moved?  Well, you know, we've got to cancel the next segment of the show because Turkish was  going to come in and suck on Otto.  Right.  He was going to, like, try to actually kiss it or something.  But no, this is highly not recommended.  A lot of reporters, including Bill O'Reilly, ask us where our line is.  We found it today.  Here it is. 
[02:11:30]  We will not have a guy suck on Otto today.  Right.  What, Sandy?  Okay.  My experience, and I've lived a long time, as you guys know, to make fun of, with doctors  and dentists, as you see.  And I even went for my math, and they want to just totally, really destroy it, whatever  I have.  Destroy it.  Yeah.  Totally, you know, totally destroy it.  And I don't believe in doctors, and I'm just going to go.  You don't believe in them like the Easter bunny.  Sandy, so what you're saying, let me get this straight.  You're saying you are not getting that taken care of?  No.  Just get it taken off, you horse's ass. 
[02:12:00]  Go to a doctor.  No, you get it cut off.  Are you Sandy?  Are you still sexually active?  No.  She's spreading that everywhere, isn't she?  Sorry, but, um, no.  Just get it taken off.  Do you have people pay you money for hummers?  Um, what's a hummer?  Uh-uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  No, of course not.  Anything for sex?  Have you had sex with a man any time, or a woman?  Yes, many times. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, boy.  We got a guy on the line that's claiming that he had sex with a candy.  No, I'm just saying, I really...  Bill, what's up?  Bill, you still there?  Yeah, Bill.  Hey, Bill.  Bill died, we just found out on the phone.  You know what?  He had a hummer.  I bet you he hung up, because it says, whatever happened with Twato, I slept with her in Nathan's  bathroom.  Slept.  He had sex with you in a Nathan's bathroom?  Right, 23rd Street.  This guy's not lying?  Well, he's not there anymore.  He had a great hot dog.  He just ran to the emergency room.  Great hot dog.  Love the mustard.  I swallowed the mustard.  Yeah. 
[02:13:00]  Holy flour.  And the relish.  I thought it was a hot dog.  So, Doc, what's going to...  What happened from here to Sandy Kane if she doesn't take care of it?  No way of telling, you know what I mean?  It may not be one of the bad stereotypes, and it's just like...  I'm sure it's disgusting, and it adds a good comedy to your show, but...  It's not, Doc, dude.  Yeah, the risks...  What are the risks of anyone being affected by this without having any type of sex with  her?  Oh, no, no.  It's not spread through the air or anything, but if you're touching it...  Wait, wait.  If she's fondling it like she just was, and then theoretically touches that door handle, 
[02:13:30]  and someone touches the door handle...  We're safe.  No?  Thank God.  All right, look.  I don't care.  I want this whole place decontaminated.  Please.  Where's the Lysol?  Get the Lysol.  We should say that this is the doctor's opinion of what it is.  Even though they're pretty sure, but...  It's a better...  It's not...  It's not this.  It's not that.  No, they said what it is.  They said what it is.  It's pretty much...  We're all in agreement.  Yeah.  Sandy, this show sucks. 
[02:14:00]  I'm agreeing with doctors suck.  Can I tell you something, Anthony?  A couple people called and said they're going to quit smoking after the last guy that may  have the smoke cancer.  Those same people just called back, no joke, and they started smoking again.  Just listening to Sandy.  Because of what they just heard with Sandy.  Did you have that thing on the letter to Senator Daschel?  What was that?  Nothing you'd ever understand.  They're laughing at Boy Campanella's legs.  Sandy, um...  Hey, it's a sad day for Sandy Campanella. 
[02:14:30]  You've got to get that taken care of.  And you have a friend.  It has a friend.  Yeah.  In the rear.  It's got a friend around that.  There is a hemorrhoid back there.  You guys have seen it.  No, no, no.  And they said there isn't one.  I'm not a doctor.  I saw it, but I don't know what the hell it is.  You saw it.  When you have eyes, right?  You know what a hemorrhoid is.  What?  There could also be a hemorrhoid, but it looks like you have a camera to see how far in it  goes.  With a camera.  Yeah, because sometimes it goes so far up that they have...  You have to remove the entire part of your...  Oh, my God. 
[02:15:00]  I think I'm just going to just keep going, guys.  Sandy Cain has a virtual Kellogg's snack pack of STDs roaming around.  I mean, I feel good.  You know, you want a little sugar pops or you want the cornflakes or the special K.  There's all kinds of stuff.  I'm going to keep going.  I'm not going to...  You are a wreck.  Sandy Cain is the monkey from Outreach?  From Outreach.  Why don't I maybe have sex with one of you guys and see if one of you comes down with  genital warts. 
[02:15:30]  Like I said yesterday, I'd rather get in a dryer of razor blades with Magic Johnson.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, man.  You guys are grossing me out.  I'm going to run in, take a shower, scrub myself with a wire brush.  Yeah.  You better decaminate that chair that she's been sitting on.  Yeah, it's gotten bad.  I've been standing.  I've been standing.  Cat from Rockville Center says, Holy S., how can you be in the same room with that?  I'm spraying my radio with Lysol just from hearing it. 
[02:16:00]  We were right the whole time, Anthony.  Everyone's suggesting hazmat suits.  Yeah, we were right the whole time.  And Lou from Brooklyn went, Bill's dead.  Oh, no.  What happened?  Let's go to Danny.  Danny, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey, guys, you remember that guy who put the Preparation H on her knack side there?  He's totally fine, and I'll tell you why.  He wore gloves, thank God.  He wore gloves.  Sandy was complaining about a hemorrhoid, so we had a listener put on rubber gloves, put  Preparation H on his fingers, and apply it to the infected area. 
[02:16:30]  And we didn't know that there was something else going on there at the time, but you guys  went in there with a flashlight, a mining helmet.  They have no doubt in their minds, Anthony.  Hey, let's bring in Turkish and give him the bad news.  Yeah.  Yeah, that he won't be Turkish.  Yeah, yeah.  Yo, bro, what's up, man?  Hello, Turkish.  Let me...  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Well, he has fake identification.  He can get us in trouble, Turkish.  All right, it's cool.  Whatever.  Yeah, he better not get us in trouble. 
[02:17:00]  We're responsible.  It doesn't matter, because you can't do anything anyway.  Yeah, we're responsible broadcasters, so...  Oh, come on.  Let's do it.  No, no, we're not going to do it.  He's going to hit it with a bat.  Great.  All right, well, we do have some more people.  You know, I'm done with this.  Send everyone home.  I've had it.  Can we go home?  I've had it.  Can I just say, I'm going to be at Stand Up New York tomorrow night?  Stand Up New York, 6 p.m., Bill Michaels' show, and I'm also going to be at New York Comedy 
[02:17:30]  Club, December 28th, and Ozzy Baez is Latin New York.  Sandy, do you have...  And watch my TV show.  And if you're not in the mood for festering groin comedy, you can go to Jersey Jokers  and see me tomorrow night.  I'm doing two shows without a growth.  Sandy, do you have...  You got something between your legs.  Sandy, listen to me.  Sandy.  I hope.  Sandy, do you have a song?  Yeah, I do.  She's got a new song.  You want her to sing it?  Yeah, she can sing it before we take a break.  What is it about? 
[02:18:00]  It's called My Boyfriend's Black.  Yeah.  All right.  Is it a...  Is it a guy that you threw out of this guy?  Right, right, right.  We figured it wasn't medically sound for him to be caressing that thing.  I'm as healthy as Roy Campanella's legs.  Sandy, are you bummed at all?  Yeah, are you upset with this?  Excuse me, I have such disrespect for doctors and dentists.  Why?  Because they're all BS.  They're not...  Why would they BS you? 
[02:18:30]  You're such an ass.  Down to your core, you're an ass.  These doctors are telling you something.  Go get it fixed.  Don't be other doctors, you frady cat.  Just get it fixed.  Why?  That it bothers me.  It bothers other people.  It bothers other people.  You're giving other people...  Wow, if that wasn't plain English...  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Don't doubt it.  But at least they gave her...  More to love.  More to love.  More to love.  Yes.  It is.  I think it's famous, Sandy. 
[02:19:00]  I love it.  Oh, wait a minute.  They're looking at something else.  Hold on.  Doctor, what are you looking at?  We'd like to look at her nose for a second.  Because there's something going on over there.  Sandy, what is that?  Let me look.  We never noticed a nose before.  There's something on my nose.  Take a look.  You knew it, too?  That's nothing.  Yeah.  Most witches have that.  They're looking at her nose.  Yeah.  God damn it.  No, that was something.  I had something removed, so...  And then it was...  All right.  What is nothing on her nose?  Oh, good news.  Look, they're just investing. 
[02:19:30]  They're looking at her...  Sandy Nose Jaw.  Are you guys going to remove it to free?  She's like a new planet.  Is this going to be like, I'm going to get free implants?  I'm going to get a free growth removal from you guys?  All right.  Listen, do you want to...  Are they going to remove it to me?  You said you don't want to deal with it.  You don't want to remove it.  Well, would they remove it?  No.  You've got to go to a specialist.  Well, are they specialists?  Who are they?  You've got to go to a vet.  Are they a vet?  No, well, a specialist.  What is that?  That's a specialist.  These are doctors.  If they're such dedicated doctors, why don't they remove it if they care? 
[02:20:00]  Oh, God.  All right.  Sandy, you want to sing your song?  They don't care.  But that's a doctor for you.  No.  Remove it with a howitzer.  Sandy, you want to sing your song?  Sure, I do.  Yeah, sing your song.  Sandy, you've got to put headphones on, okay?  Okay.  Oh, no.  Make sure you throw away those headphones after Sandy leaves.  All right.  You ready, Sandy?  I heard that.  Oh, your headphones.  Sorry.  It's my headphones.  All right, dildo.  Don't worry about it.  All right.  Here we go.  Oh, that poor thing.  Here we go.  He likes you.  Here we go.  Everyone pick up Junk. 
[02:20:30]  There we go.  Sandy, I came singing his song.  My Boyfriend's Black, is it O.C.  My Boyfriend's Black, and his name is Mike Tyson.  Hey, I'm a boy.  He likes to rape me, because I'm Jewish.  Hey, I'm a boy.  My Boyfriend's Black, and his name is O.J. 
[02:21:00]  Hey, I'm a boy.  Hey, I'm a boy.  He killed his wife with a knife, I say.  Hey, I'm a boy.  My Boyfriend's Black, and his name is Michael Jackson. 
[02:21:30]  He is a pedophile.  He likes the action.  My Boyfriend is Black, and his name is O.C.  All right, I've had enough of her in this song.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  What makes you believe that you believe all your lies, O.J.?  This is the worst song ever. 
[02:22:00]  Big Black, and I really love your size, I say.  The way he's hit her in the head, Ant.  My Boyfriend's Black, and his name is O.J.  Hey, I, I, I, I, I.  He killed his wife with a knife, I say.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  My boyfriend is black.  All you black guys out there, I love you.  In fact, I'm getting a new black vibrator.  Just after the show, right?  Any right? 
[02:22:30]  I'm a black one and a white one.  I love you, I'm a white one.  I love you, I'm a white one.  My boyfriend is black.  All right.  All right.  Syndicate, everyone.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Elvis, baby.  All right.  Thank you, Sandra.  I am a whore.  Uh-oh, he broke one of the microphones.  And so were doctors.  What was that?  Which mic is broke?  Oh, no, it sounds better now.  All right, Sandra, give your plugs.  Is that supposed to be sexy? 
[02:23:00]  Hey, you said he had too nice clay.  Oh, my God.  Okay, my plugs are I will be at Stand Up New York tomorrow night.  You're the ugliest stripper I've ever seen in my life.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  At Stand Up New York.  And, ooh, what are you doing down there?  What's buzzing?  Oh, turn that goddamn thing off.  No, it's her, uh, her device.  Dildo.  Oh, jeez.  I don't want to get the A's, fellas.  No S.  You're a filthy whore.  And how about a nice bucket of A's?  No, Bob, you have to Stand Up New York tomorrow night at 6 o'clock. 
[02:23:30]  Remember, you're a drag queen.  At Bill, uh, Michael's, uh, thing.  Shut up!  I want to say hello to Ozzy Baez at New York Comedy Club.  Shut up!  I'll be there December 28th.  Me and Swado and Dildo.  And also watch my own show.  Oh, God.  The Sandy Cain Blue Comedy Show.  Oh, God.  I'm in that neighborhood, never channel 56, RCN 108.  It's also on in Hollywood, 18 and 2 tables.  And I just still don't believe in doctors, though.  I don't believe.  More than ever, I don't.  Baby, I just don't, honey. 
[02:24:00]  I just don't.  Goodbye.  All right.  Goodbye.  Thank you.  Goodbye.  Thank you.  Goodbye.  Good riddance.  Goodbye.  All right.  All right.  Uh, we'd throw you out of the studio, but no one wants to touch the show.  Uh, there you have it, gang.  Sandy Cain Twado equals genital warts.  Warts.  And it has a friend in the back area.  Oh, God damn.  I am so completely disgusted.  Guys, all right, look, you're all professionals and everything.  I understand that.  But when you see something like that, there's a basic human reaction to it. 
[02:24:30]  I mean, it's horrific.  It's disgusting.  It's super pleasant.  It really is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you knew right when you saw it.  You're like, oh, yeah.  Oh, I saw it on the website.  Yeah.  I was like, oh, it's easy.  Top ten things you've seen in your life that, uh, one of my children.  Yeah.  It's one of the most disgusting things you've ever seen.  It's up there.  It's definitely up there.  As a whole person.  The cousin around back is worse than, uh, Quanto itself. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, God.  Really?  Cousin.  It looked like it might have had twins.  They were like two of them coming out.  Oh, God.  No kidding around.  They can crawl up, uh, directly from now.  They can keep going and growing and crawling into certain areas that, okay, great.  That's fantastic.  I am completely disgusted.  Doc, is it safe to say we're going to have two less listeners by this time next year?  It was maybe three.  Maybe three?  Another guy?  No, there's two.  Well, if one's blind, we'll be like, oh, there you go. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Today's show, you may lose, you know, thousands of listeners.  Is it safe to assume, uh, Sandy Kane's cervix looks like, uh, Sonny Corleone after the cold?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Her rectum looks like the horse's head in bed.  Let's, uh, let's take a break, Anthony, huh?  Oh, don't get that part.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's like listening to Corky and Cara M. Quinlan.  Opie and Anthony.  I'd rather hear my penis in a place than listen to those two. 
[02:26:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And we're back with The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hanging with a bunch of doctors.  Boy, you guys are a bunch of laughs.  Tim Norton in the studio, Anthony.  Yeah.  What a day, what a day, what a day.  You all right, Tim?  This is really, people think it's cringe radio to listen to.  Try looking at it.  You see a bunch of doctors go, ugh.  That's never good, right? 
[02:26:30]  That's frightening.  We might have to start the What Do We Learn segment early today because they're just, it's off the chart.  Oh, my God.  We're getting so many.  What an education people got, whether they liked it or not.  We got a dentist on the line that's a little pissed off.  Vince, what's up?  Hey, how you guys going?  All right, man.  Listen, I'm a dentist in New Jersey, and I'm thinking you guys are scaring the hell out of that guy, Pete.  Like, it's not, it can be cancer, but I don't think it is.  I think it's something else.  Well, you didn't see it or feel it.  I did, exactly.  I know I didn't, but where they were describing it at, it's more likely from either tooth borne or maybe like a salivary tumor or something like that. 
[02:27:00]  Well, hopefully you're right.  That's right.  I'm praying you're right, Doc.  But you never know.  It could be the big casino also.  All right.  All right.  Love you guys.  All right.  Bye.  They didn't say it was canceled.  Definitely, maybe.  They just gave their opinions.  Right.  No diagnosis today.  Well hung, what's up?  Hey, man.  I just figured out what to send bin Laden for Christmas.  Huh?  Sandy Kane.  Yeah.  Yeah, no doubt. 
[02:27:30]  God damn.  Imagine her just running around.  Eh, eh, eh.  I'll infect you.  Ow, ow, ow.  Is she like the poster girl for STDs from the 1920s?  Yeah.  She's the girl you just don't touch.  Hey, right?  Oh, ow.  Gina, what's going on?  Yeah, I got a solution to two problems.  Usually when you have a wart, they cauterize it.  Norton wants to quit smoking.  He can have him smoke his last cigarette and have him put it out on her wart and cauterize  it.  And so this way, every time he goes to light up another cigarette, he can think of that. 
[02:28:00]  Think of the smell that comes off the burning wart.  Very good.  Jimmy, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I just want to thank you.  I learned two valuable lessons.  I quit smoking and I stopped banging a 99-year-old whore.  All right.  Very good.  Very good.  B-Dog from D.C., what's up?  Just like I told the chick, I'm just disgusted and repulsed beyond all recognition and comprehension. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  Nice.  Awful.  Yeah.  I mean, well, what are you guys going to do Monday?  I mean, I love your show, Norton's Grave.  What are you going to do Monday, man?  You going to bring a bunch of doctors in and bring in, like, ten AIDS victims to see who's  going to die faster?  No, no.  No, homeless shopping spree Tuesday, my friend.  Tuesday.  Doing something good for the holidays.  Oh, God.  Just like you said earlier, Opie, I tossed my cigarettes out.  I kept, like, two or three, and then I had to go pick the pack up off the ground and smoke,  like, five more.  All right, big dog.  Yeah.  We're going to come see you guys soon.  Thank you.  All right.  See you.  All right. 
[02:29:00]  There's a couple other guys.  Do we have time?  Maybe real fast?  What do you want to do?  It's up to you.  Ugh.  Do they have anything potentially life-threatening?  Yeah, I know.  We don't have much time.  Just keep them out if they do.  I have to plug one thing real quick because there was somebody.  I have to do it.  Whore.  I am a whore.  I know.  There's cancer all over the place, and I'm doing a gig tomorrow.  Seriously?  Yeah, Jersey Joker.  It's a holiday inn in Tom's River.  I'll be hanging myself at the end of the late show.  But I am there tomorrow.  Or somebody called, and the retard said, no, he's not here. 
[02:29:30]  I'm there tomorrow night.  It's two shows.  Thank you.  All right.  Eileen, what's going on?  Well, I've got a question for you.  Or I've got a question for the doctors, actually.  I see what you want to say, so be very careful.  Okay.  Our listeners are very intelligent.  They can figure out what you're saying.  Okay.  It kind of looks like acne, and it can get, I want to say, pus-filled kind of thing.  A little pussy?  Yeah, and it's on the inside of the door.  It's just on the inside of the door. 
[02:30:00]  All right.  It could be a bunch of things.  It could be a bunch of things.  Rickets.  Rickets.  Who said Rickets?  Rickets.  Rickets.  Got the Rickets.  You didn't sleep with us in a cane, did you?  No, I didn't.  Eh, eh.  All right.  Docs, real fast.  Too many things to tell.  They could be so much.  Too broad.  Sit in some stridex.  Have you seen a doctor yet?  Huh?  Has she seen a doctor?  Yeah, Eileen, you see a doctor on this one?  No, I haven't seen a doctor about it, but I was just wondering, you know, if they could  give me a general idea of what they think it is. 
[02:30:30]  Too many things it could be.  She needs to have a GYN exam.  Yes, of course.  Yeah.  Don't you go to a gyno?  Well, yeah, I've been there, but they never said nothing about it.  Never said nothing about it?  No, they just, you know, they do the regular exam and then they don't say nothing about it.  Did you ask about it?  And sometimes, pardon?  Did you ask about it?  No.  All right, so don't do anything.  Just wait until you're sitting on a subway and you stand up and the seat comes with you. 
[02:31:00]  All right.  Eileen, go to the doctor.  Yeah, and he'll let you know, I guess.  All right?  Okay.  All right.  Uncle John, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Sandy should wear a sign that says, do not enter, and change your name to the Wartag.  I'll tell you.  You know what's nice about being syndicated?  Yeah.  You've ruined dinner time nationwide.  No doubt.  Yeah, I know.  Hey, John, how uncomfortable did it get today?  Oh, man.  You've been listening to us for a long time.  Yeah, this was one of the toughest.  Well, I'll tell you, this was one of the toughest. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  It was scary.  We were all having fun and stuff.  Out of nowhere, it took a drastic left-hand turn off a cliff.  Big time.  Wow.  I'll tell you, I'm still shivering.  It's crazy.  All right, man.  I'll catch you.  I can't tell you how many people have said that they'll never smoke again after today's show.  Yeah.  All right.  And we've got to break again because we went real late with us.  Yeah, I know.  When we come back, we're going to have a really good round of what did we learn on the Opie Anthony show.  There's so many good ones.  Are you bastards ready to rock? 
[02:32:00]  Opie and Anthony.  When you actually find them rubbing the feces on the wall.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Psychotic apes.  Is this for shock factor?  Oh, my God.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, my God.  Rick says the guy with the puffy nips is pretty cool looking.  You've got to see these.  All right.  Bring them in real fast.  I'll start.  What do we learn as Rick invites the last guy in for what the hell is that? 
[02:32:30]  Okay, Anthony?  Fine.  Chuck from Lindbrook, New York writes, today I learned that I don't want to get the ninja, fellas.  You guys suck.  Harry from Philly.  I learned Sandy Kane has a Kellogg's snack pack of STDs.  Yep.  Sandy has sex with people in comas.  And Asama is living in Sandy's balloon knot.  Ken from Jersey.  Today I learned that the doctor's reaction to Tuato is, oh, man.  Yeah, we've got to play that on Monday.  You guys, the reaction when you first saw Tuato was just fantastic. 
[02:33:00]  And Ted from Connecticut, before we get to the puffy nipple guy.  Yep.  Can you say that?  Yeah, you can say that.  All right, good.  Ted writes, I know it's a little early for what did I learn, but I learned I finally figured out what happened to Earl's brain.  When he was in the womb, it involuted.  Involuted.  There you go.  Very good.  So, what's your name, bro?  Mike.  Hey, Mike.  We don't have much time, so I guess we've got to get right to it.  You've got this problem with your... 
[02:33:30]  Wow.  Lift and bolt.  Lift and bolt.  Oh, my God.  Again, if I could make the reference to the album cover.  Yeah, Blind Faith.  Blind Faith.  You look like the little girl on the Blind Faith.  The little girl on the Blind Faith album cover.  And why did you shoot Gunnery Sergeant Hartman?  Wow.  Private Pyle.  Puffy Nips.  What do you guys think?  Gynocomastia, it's called.  They protrude. 
[02:34:00]  Gynocomastia.  Man boobs?  Yep.  Man boobs.  Man boobs.  And how is that taken care of?  It depends what causes them.  There's a lot of different causes.  How long you had them like that, sir?  Ever since I remember.  Yeah?  I'm sure kids are very kind when it comes to things like that in school.  We've seen man boobs.  This is a little different.  It's a whole nip.  Just the nip area is very comfy.  Way out.  Those are pink and delicious looking.  It's nice to know we could end on an up note with man boobs. 
[02:34:30]  It's no problem.  Very good.  You could squirt as far as that last guy.  Yeah.  That's all right.  It's not life-threatening, I hope.  I don't think so.  Very good.  Can we put a picture of that up on the website?  I don't care.  Get the profile.  Steve from foundrymusic.com may have some good video for your viewing pleasure.  He has probably some of the sickest video we've ever seen from today.  And if you don't know how to get to foundrymusic.com, go to opianthony.com and there'll be a link, okay? 
[02:35:00]  Steve, what's going on?  What did you learn on the show today?  Howdy.  Hey.  Baggots.  Yeah, what's up?  Okay, I learned a few things.  First, I learned I'm never going to smoke again.  Second, I learned I'll be seeing Norton at the Jersey Chokers show tomorrow.  Okay.  And third, I learned that Opie's left-handed fallen victim to bacterial vaginosis.  Yeah.  Very good, Steve.  Thank you.  Have a good weekend.  Who knew lurking right just behind Twato was the more evil Mecca Twato on Sandy Kane? 
[02:35:30]  Stoner, what's up?  Because the Mecca is always a lot more dangerous than the regular one.  Yes.  Stoner, go ahead.  I learned that the FU line is on B, not A.  Hey, good one.  Again.  And you can get to the FU line through opianthony.com.  It's such a great bit that other people enjoy it as well on other radio stations.  Hey, just call it other things.  Just call it other things and hope no one notices.  Yeah, great.  Schlocko.  Big Lou from Buffalo.  I learned today on A more effective than those stupid quit-smoking ads. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, I hope so.  Franz from Jersey.  I learned that if a girl ignores her area, it's like a haunted house with hair.  Two, I learned that homeless people use dual shopping carts for tax reasons.  And I learned that the AIDS is called ninja on the streets.  He's a ninja.  Let me go to Jay.  Jay.  I learned I never want to be a doctor.  Yeah.  What's up, shwoogies?  Hey, Jay, what's up?  Hey, I learned I don't want anything involuted on my body.  Yes. 
[02:36:30]  What's up, bugs?  Later.  All right, man.  Hey, Vic, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey.  Go ahead, Vic.  Yeah, I learned today that the only way to really cure Sandy Cain is a shotgun with a  toe attachment.  Yep.  No rules.  Thanks, boys.  All right.  Oh, God, I'm so skeeved out by today.  Why?  It's just Sandy Cain being in the same, like the air that's going into her lungs and being  breathed out might actually be breathed in by me. 
[02:37:00]  Jay, what's up?  She's a mess.  Yeah.  What's up, Jay?  All right.  First, it's fine, but then you start stirring the juices.  All right, guys.  Stirring the juices.  Hey, do the doctors have any plugs?  Nothing?  You all set?  Yeah, they're going to keep it on the QT.  The one doctor was telling us a great story during commercials.  Yeah, that's a good one.  About a little exam and a guy having a little problem while the exam was going.  Oh, you can pretty much say what happened.  He was giving the guy a finger probe to make sure everything was clear for an enema. 
[02:37:30]  That's what it is.  And the second he started his examination in that fashion, the guy had a happy ending  all over the table.  And you know what's really, really annoying is I've continually apologized.  And the guy still holds it against you, Norton?  Yeah.  Don't forget Tuesday on the Opie and Anthony Show, homeless shopping.  Yeah. 
[02:38:00]  Denise from Delaware.  I learned that almost everyone's third nip involutes when they were born, and I had  to learn how to spell involute today.  F-tar Mike from Dub Bronx.  Today I learned that even doctors cover their eyes in Grimace.  That is true.  We saw it.  Carlos from Jersey.  I learned you could go to the local A&P and drive away in a new or used Cadillac.  F-tar Mike from Hell.  I learned when you lick your lips on the train, you get cancer.  Oh, God.  Wow.  Well, we don't know for sure. 
[02:38:30]  Cecil from Philly.  I learned if my salad turns white after putting vinegar on it, don't eat it.  Words to live by, Lloyd.  Scott, what's up?  Yeah, I learned that the kid who said he'd suck on twatto changed his mind.  Well, no, we changed it.  No, we said there's no way we're going to have him do that.  Very good.  Let's go to Dan.  Dan, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  I learned that the FBI got a hot tip in the Senator Daschle case. 
[02:39:00]  Must be arresting, Sandy.  Repo George.  Hey, what's happening, boys?  Hey.  Hey, I learned today that if a doctor says something's bizarre or cool, you're in big trouble.  Why am I laughing?  You're right.  Thank you, George.  Jonathan.  Hello.  Hey, Jonathan, what's up?  Hey, all I got to tell you is I'm so nauseous that my balls ache.  I wanted to give you guys a call today because I wanted to tell you about a benefit show that I'm doing on Monday night at the Vanderbilt in Plainview. 
[02:39:30]  On Long Island.  Cool.  Yeah.  What do you got?  I got Deepin' Out of Blackout coming.  Okay.  The Grapes of Vaudevillian Fantasy.  Okay.  Red Flannel Hash featuring Rob Baracco from Phil Lesh and Friends.  Okay.  Undercover Funk.  And the legendary Little Buster and the Soul Brothers.  All right.  And it's obviously a 9-1-1 disaster relief benefit and all the money's going to Robin Hood, the folks that did the big show at the Garden.  And I'm hoping maybe you guys will come down and maybe all listeners will come down.  It's only a $20 ticket and all the bucks is going to do some good. 
[02:40:00]  I'll still be in a bathtub.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're going to be getting sprayed down.  All weekend long.  Yes.  I'm going through a car wash on the way home.  Sounds reasonable.  Thank you, Jonathan.  Thanks very much, guys.  All right.  Cool.  Bye-bye.  Dean from Staten Island, I learned last time Sandy went to a gynecologist, Voss's jokes were funny.  Wow.  Poor Voss.  He's not even here to defend himself.  Oh, he never is.  Stacy.  Yeah.  Hey.  I learned two things.  One, there's a studio full of people who are going to have to go home and take a bath in acid. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  And two, you can diagnose Twato, but we still can't figure out what the hell it's attached to.  Yeah, someone was suggesting we ask Twato if it wants Sandy Cain removed.  King Gang Twato.  All right.  King Gang Twato.  Very funny.  One for you.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, I tuned in late today, but I just want to let you know that Tim Norton doesn't know where he works.  No?  No, he's actually going to the Howard Johnson, not to the Holiday Inn.  Oh, I'm sorry, man. 
[02:41:00]  Thank you.  Howard.  No problem, man.  I'll be there.  Wow.  Thank God, because the Holiday Inn would have been embarrassing.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Howard Johnson and Tom's River is quite a step up.  Howard Johnson.  All right.  Thank you.  Later, man.  Let's go to Chris.  Chris, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned that my boyfriend is black.  Some people enjoyed the Sandy Cain song.  Yeah.  All right.  And I also learned, ah!  Okay.  Well, he probably did that a few times.  Rich, what's going on? 
[02:41:30]  Rich?  Hello?  All right.  We lost Rich.  Okay.  Yeah.  John from the Boston area.  Holy F.  Thank you for making my smoking history.  I was smoking a butt when that guy was being looked at.  F it.  That's it.  I put the thing out, and that is it.  No more.  Again, thanks, and good luck Tuesday.  Paul writes, I just want to be the first to say that today I learned the last time Sandy  Cain stripped for money, Roy Campanella had legs, and bonus, the Dodgers were in Brooklyn. 
[02:42:00]  All right.  Wow.  What a day.  Dave?  Yeah, what's up?  Hey, man.  What's going on?  Yeah, I got two things I learned today.  Yeah.  First, if it's white and it's not smelly, it's okay.  Yeah.  But if it's white and it smells of Haitian marathon runners, that's bad.  Very bad.  And then I learned that you probably need a tongue with four-wheel drive to get over Sandy  Cain's in a senidale rock formation.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  All right.  You guys rule, man.  Thank you, Dave.  Thank you.  Bert from Jersey suggesting that Twato's brother be called Butto, which is pretty funny. 
[02:42:30]  All right.  Butto.  Why not?  In Bastien Pierre.  Chris writes, I learned cancer equals radio kryptonite.  Oh, of course.  I learned Twato has a little friend.  By this time, next year, two less listeners.  And Sandy Cain's rectum looks like a horse's head.  All right.  And Tuttle saying, today, I learned it's all funny until someone gets cancer.  We don't know for sure.  Of course not. 
[02:43:00]  You just got to get it checked out.  Okay.  Well, we're done.  Nobody picked up this one.  Huh?  Oh, yeah.  I learned Allison is the hottest doctor I've ever seen in my life.  There you go.  She was very cool today.  And you guys were very cool as well.  So thanks for helping us out.  Yeah.  Guys, thank you very much.  Because we will never, ever be doing this again.  No.  All the other radio stations can have this.  Take it away.  We are done with this one.  Take it and run with it, you bastards.  All right, Ant.  Have a great weekend.  Yes. 
[02:43:30]  And Monday, Gene Simmons on the show.  And Tuesday, the homeless shopping spree, too.  Oh, I can't wait.  We met, who was his name?  Rock and Roll Tommy or Timmy?  Rock and Roll Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy Race.  500.  Rock and Roll Tommy Race.  All right.  We got to get out.  Ben's freaking stuff.  All right, man.  Thank you.  You guys have deteriorated beyond belief right now.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Thank you.  We got to get out.  We got to get out.  We got to get out.  We got to get out.  We got to get out.  We got to get out.  We got to get out.  We got to get out.  We got to get out.  We got to get out. 
[02:44:00]  We got to get out.  We got to get out.  We got to get out.  We got to get out.  We got to get out.  We got to get out.  We got to get out.  We got to get out.  We got to get out.  We got to get out.  We got to get out.  We got to get out.  We got to get out.  We got to get out.  We got to get out.  We got to get out.  We got to get out. </pre>
