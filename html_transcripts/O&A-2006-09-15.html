<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show broadcast opened with a furious, profanity-laced tirade against Howard Stern, whom they repeatedly called names like "doddering old woman," "crazy person," "lunatic," and "paranoid schizo jackass."  The hosts vehemently disputed Stern's claims of a smear campaign by terrestrial radio, arguing his declining popularity stemmed from irrelevance and satellite radio's limited reach.  They played audio clips of Stern making these claims, punctuating them with sarcastic commentary and laughter.  Opie and Anthony also criticized Artie Lange for supporting Stern's narrative, particularly regarding their supposedly unsuccessful appearance on David Letterman.  They countered that the Letterman appearance, initially scheduled for four or five minutes, was extended to eleven due to positive audience response, and accused Stern of dishonesty and behind-the-scenes sabotage attempts, including a meeting with their superiors.  They recounted an incident at the Plaza Hotel where Stern allegedly refused a press conference until they were removed. The hosts discussed Stern's satellite radio deal, questioning the accuracy of his subscriber numbers.  The entire segment was riddled with crude and offensive language.

The show continued with a discussion of their recent successful appearance on David Letterman.  They clarified their previously fabricated feud with Ron and Fez as a joke, expressing surprise at its serious reception.  A significant portion focused on a popular Bill Burr comedy video on YouTube and the contrasting reactions it received compared to other comedians at the same venue.  The hosts also criticized New York Post columnist Linda Stassi's commentary on *Survivor*'s racial casting, using derogatory terms and accusing her of racism and lack of humor.  Otto and George were in-studio, and their upcoming gigs were heavily promoted.

The *Survivor* article critique continued, with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton using racial slurs and offensive language while mocking Stassi. They questioned Mark Burnett's motivations. The conversation veered into broader discussions about race relations, referencing the O.J. Simpson trial and ethnic enclaves.  A caller, Jason from Georgia, inquired about the tribes' camp construction, leading to further discussion on race and stereotypes. Another caller highlighted the irony of Burnett's stance given the show's premise.  Anthony's purchase of a Shelby GT500 was jokingly attributed to a midlife crisis. Otto and George remained in studio, and Kenny was mocked for cutting strawberries.  Listener calls were interspersed throughout.  The first half concluded with a transition to the XM portion, featuring further offensive comments and vulgar banter with a female listener who received pajamas from E-Rock.  Football picks and final banter ended the segment.

The show resumed with listener calls about XM radio channels, including praise for Decades and a humorous, potentially offensive segment from Channel 163. A caller sent a picture of a woman's exposed breasts to Jimmy.  The hosts then discussed a transcript—involving Francine, Jimmy, and Steve—detailing a potentially suspicious situation surrounding the death of MSNBC's Nicole's son, hinting at a possible cover-up.  Jim Gaffigan called in, discussing his weight gain, his show "My Boys," and Bill Burr's Philadelphia performance.  A discussion about a nursing mother denied breastfeeding in Toys R Us followed, prompting a lengthy, explicit, and vulgar debate on public breastfeeding, featuring numerous listener calls and offensive language.

Joel McHale called in, and the conversation shifted to celebrity news, including a purported photo of Lindsay Lohan's vagina, Anna Nicole Smith's son's death, Rosie O'Donnell, Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown’s separation, and Deborah LaFave.  The discussion of Lohan's photo was explicit, with speculation on its authenticity.  Jimmy experienced an involuntary erection, becoming a comedic focus. The segment ended with a proposed, highly inappropriate "breastfeeding parade" as a comedic stunt.

Finally, the show included a segment promoting Ron and Fez, mentioning "candy skins," and Opie announcing drinks at FH Riley's.  A song with lyrics about paranoia, warnings to stop, and a sense of being watched or pursued was played, followed by a sexually suggestive audio clip using vulgar language.  No guests were present during this segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM202, featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Creeps.  Angle-biter.  Obviously the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's worse than I imagined. 
[00:00:30]  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  And we're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, corn balls, three retards.  We have the effect of town all PM.  Yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep.  Yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm Dan.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah, he already has one.  I don't wait.  He doesn't wait for nothing.  You like it?  He loves it.  I love it.  We can start by talking about that in a few seconds here.  After we play some of these clips. 
[00:01:30]  It's Friday.  Friday.  It's Friday.  Hey.  Hey.  It's a conspiracy.  What a dope.  Conspiracy.  What a dope.  Conspiring against me.  Thanks for giving us energy for today's show, you dope.  All of radio. 
[00:02:00]  You dope.  Terrestrial radio.  Sees this show as such a threat that they've hired a publicist.  To go after me.  Really?  Have they?  You ass.  Good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  We're getting bigger every single day.  Every day.  Every day. 
[00:02:30]  Our phone number 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  While other people fizzle.  Fizzle away.  With delusions.  With your yes men that surround you telling you how great things are going.  Are they?  Are they really?  Because everyone else besides the people that sit there and smooch your ass. 
[00:03:00]  Everyone else that knows what they're talking about in the business.  People without agendas are sitting there and spilling out what is called fact.  Using stats, ratings, research.  But no.  It's a conspiracy against me.  Unbelievable.  This doddering old woman. 
[00:03:30]  With his house N.  I wish I could say the word.  With his house.  He got her off the plantation and brought her in the house.  So yes sir.  Yes sir.  Whatever you want me to say sir.  You're a house N.  And then that fat son of a bitch Artie Lang. 
[00:04:00]  That sits there with him.  With both of them girls.  Enough.  This guy finally has lost his mind.  I keep thinking he's lost his mind with every statement he makes.  I think well that's it.  He finally went crazy.  But this time he's just.  He's lost his mind.  Is he actually convinced?  He's convinced.  I'm serious people. 
[00:04:30]  He's convinced.  We're not allowed to use that word.  What?  Serious.  Oh right.  Right.  I'm.  I'm.  Not kidding Lee.  Not kidding.  Lee.  People.  Ish.  He actually believes that all of terrestrial radio.  This entity that is terrestrial radio.  Which by the way is broken up into a bunch of companies and factions and this that doesn't 
[00:05:00]  get along with that and this trying to beat up that.  But all of them have gotten together in this huge conspiracy to put out press releases against  a guy that now has less listeners than any one of these stations that are conspiring against  him that have all gotten together.  Less listeners.  That are that have decided that he is so important so scary to everybody in terrestrial that they 
[00:05:30]  had a group up and get publicists to run a smear campaign on him on how we did.  I'm.  I don't know what to say about this.  He's he's a crazy person.  He's losing his mind.  Holy Jesus.  He doesn't like that people aren't paying attention to him anymore and it's really affecting  him.  I'll give him.  I'll give him this his his hardcore fans that that never listened to anything else went over 
[00:06:00]  there.  It was a small percentage of his general audience.  They're saying anywhere from 10 percent up to his high and as 15 maybe a million.  A little over a million people over there listening to him.  Not at once.  This is over a period of time.  Never at one given moment. 
[00:06:30]  And that to radio is so scary that radio had a band together.  This entity that he just calls radio banded together.  Radio can't get together to do anything.  Threw away their differences.  Yeah.  Because of scary Howard and his maybe a million listeners to to to hire a publicist and smear  him with things that say his web traffic has dropped 90 percent, which is the same amount 
[00:07:00]  of people that didn't go over and follow him that he thought.  Yeah.  As he spouts things as this is better than his greatest expectations.  What the paycheck?  I'll give you that.  But I just I couldn't hold it in any longer.  Opie played some audio that I hadn't heard right before we went on the air and it just  lit me up.  This goon, this idiot is actually of the mindset there is a conspiracy against him. 
[00:07:30]  Worse than the government ever was is terrestrial radio.  Holy mother of God does no no one cares what you're doing over there.  No one read.  No one gives a flying F what you're doing over there.  Just in the satellite radio world, XM is kicking his ass. 
[00:08:00]  You're a non entity.  You're a former cultural icon is what you are.  I'll give you all the credit in the world that you always say no one ever gives you.  You were giant.  You were the biggest goddamn thing in radio for a set amount of years.  It was the perfect time.  You were the perfect thing for it.  The crowds you used to have were amazing.  That did happen.  Yes, I agree wholeheartedly that happened. 
[00:08:30]  But now you're not even on the frigging radar.  It's an insult to yourself to sit there like a doddering old woman and bitch that that that  all of radio is conspiring.  Howard, wake up.  No one cares what you're doing.  Like I said, your hardcore fans, they they care.  They love calling and saying Baba Booey like it's 1988. 
[00:09:00]  Like like Jimmy pointed out yesterday.  It's just sad.  And that's where you sit.  You sit there with all your yes people.  With the with the with your fat, your fat house and that's all she does.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, gosh.  That's brilliant.  And the fat.  Yes, man.  Artie.  Who ought to keep his his effing mouth shut. 
[00:09:30]  That's a shame with Artie.  You know, we never had a never had an issue with him.  I always thought he was fine.  When he went in there when he went in there with Colin Quinn, always funny, clever to meet  you.  Right.  I already remember all that fun stuff.  The only guy that probably could have replaced Jackie because he has a great wit about him.  He's quick.  He's he's raunchy, things like that.  And then he's got to just jump in as a yes man because he sees his boss unraveling. 
[00:10:00]  He's got to sit there and look at his bread and butter unravel in front of him because perhaps  Howard's a psychopath that actually believes this crap.  The rest of the people around you, Howard, they look at you and talk about you behind  your back like the lunatic you are.  They address you as a nut.  But they got to be yes men in front of you.  Keep your head going like like like you're actually relevant and people care and there's  a conspiracy. 
[00:10:30]  Why weren't we at the conspiracy meeting, Opie?  I don't know.  We weren't invited.  I missed that one where they hired the press team to smear this guy that no one gives a  flying F about.  You're flopping on satellite, jackass.  You're flopping.  FMQB.  Howard Stern claims to be victim of a smear campaign.  A smear campaign, Robin.  Reacting to recent reports of his alleged demise.  Could you bring me some tea?  I need a mint julep.  Don't spit in it. 
[00:11:00]  Oh, he brought you into the house, did he?  Ew.  Ew.  That's all she does.  Oh.  Really earning the paycheck with ew.  Yeah.  Every morning.  How did that work out?  Boy.  It's all just yes people around him trying to hang on to their jobs by their fingernails  while your boss comes apart.  You think deep down she realizes that she was hired back in the day so Howard could make  black jokes? 
[00:11:30]  Of course.  And she sits there and collects her paycheck by just doing ew all morning.  It's got to kill her.  The reality is she was hired so Howard could do racial humor.  Could do racial humor with impunity.  That was why she was hired.  Now you can do racist humor on the radio and no one's going to give a crap for the most  part.  But back in the day, you had to, you know, you had to protect yourself and cover all  your bases like, hey, look, I even have a black woman that works on this show.  I've got a black woman here.  If I'm upsetting black people, she'd say something. 
[00:12:00]  Right.  Would she?  Oh, God.  Oh, Howard.  Oh, enough, you irrelevant old woman.  Irrelevant.  No one cares.  God damn it.  Keep trying to fight us, Howard.  You're not going to win that battle.  FMQB.  Howard Stern claims to be victim of a smear campaign.  Smear.  Reacting to recent reports of his alleged demise.  Howard Stern stated today that he is the victim of a smear campaign by terrestrial radio 
[00:12:30]  that is trying to discredit his satellite radio gig stemming from a post by Bill Tanser  of Hitwise titled, Did Satellite Kill the Radio Star?  There's a lot of these articles coming out because people have been, you know, paying  attention.  A lot of those.  A lot of people in the know are realizing no one's talking about him.  You know, it's called water cooler talk.  There's not part of water cooler talk anymore.  New York radio message board.  Heard a bunch of posts under the heading, Howard Stern fading, fading, fading. 
[00:13:00]  When was the last time you went to work and someone said, did you hear Howard on the  way in today?  Oh my God.  No one.  He blah, blah, blah.  Because his fans are his yes men also.  They're paying to hear him.  That was the, that was one of the issues we always had with satellite radio.  And it's just the nature of the beast.  You're going to get people that like you.  They're paying to hear you.  So you get a lot of yes people around you.  Terrestrial radio keeps you grounded because you could take a call that says, you know, 
[00:13:30]  you guys suck and you have fun with it.  Why do we suck?  What's the, you know, what's your problem with the show?  Well, you do this, that, you keep them on, you have fun with them, you bash them, whatever.  It's someone that doesn't like you.  He's surrounded now the whole company from the president to that goddamn place, right  down to the littlest intern is just yesing him.  You're doing great.  This is fantastic.  What a wonderful thing this is.  And you know what?  They're the only people talking about you.  My question is like at one point he was yelling, like not enough listeners went over. 
[00:14:00]  Like remember you're saying like, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, I'm pissed off at all my listeners.  They didn't come over.  They're not coming over.  Right.  So, but then how can you have that?  And then also they say it exceeds your greatest expectations.  Exceeds his greatest expectation.  Hey man, it's frustrating.  We were there, you know, when we were just doing our XM satellite radio show, we had a bigger  audience than he has now on his satellite radio show.  And, and, and it was a nice audience, but it was spread very thin across America.  So you would work your ass off and do your radio show.  And then you walk the streets of New York and you realize half these people, half Jesus,  I wish it was half 99.9% of the people that you're walking past on the streets of New York 
[00:14:30]  have no clue what you did that day on the radio.  They weren't listening.  You got everybody all over the country listening, but it's a very small percentage in any one  given place.  So the newspapers don't really write about you because in whatever market you're, you're  in on satellite really isn't getting a huge amount of people.  You're getting a huge amount of people across the whole country, but no, no one's, no one  cares what you're saying. 
[00:15:00]  And then when you went back to commercial radio, we're doing both now here at free FM in New  York city, our exposure drastically went up in late April, drastically.  Also in the papers are writing about us again.  Every day.  The people in the business are writing about us.  We got magazines and TV shows and what have you.  They all want, you know, a piece of the Opie and Anthony show.  They want to do interviews.  They want us on their TV shows.  And it's not mentions about, you know, Oh, the company they're working for, the stock  went up or went down.  And you might remember that a year ago they hired blah, blah, blah. 
[00:15:30]  And that's why your name is in the story.  It's stories about what we're doing.  The virus show, uh, being on a satellite and terrestrial getting new markets.  Those are the stories, what we're doing on our show.  Guests were having things with, that's what they're talking about.  Not just, uh, Oh, let's talk subscriptions in the business section and how he's name comes  up.  And where we sit, that feels really, really good.  Where he sits, it doesn't feel good.  Uh, when you realize, wow, people aren't paying attention to what you're doing. 
[00:16:00]  So you're unraveling and you come up with a conspiracy, a smear campaign by terrestrial  radio.  Joe, are you insane?  Yes, you are.  You're a crazy person.  All right.  Stemming from a post by Bill Tanser of hit wise title, did satellite kill the radio star,  which cites a decline in web traffic for howardstern.com media outlets have picked up on the allegations  and started reporting that Stern's career is in decline.  That is a fact.  You can't deny it.  And it happens to everybody in entertainment. 
[00:16:30]  Guess what?  It's a fact.  Can't deny it.  Career is on the downside now.  It has been for many, many years.  Got a huge paycheck.  That's the upside of what he did.  As far as his listener base goes, his pop culture status.  And here it is.  King of all media.  Nothing.  No one cares.  Stern rebuffed the comments today stating, I've got more enemies now than I ever have.  We are so successful here at satellite radio.  The entire radio industry effing with me, hiring publicists to plant whatever S they can say in the paper 
[00:17:00]  to make it seem like we're losers.  My enemies are way worse than the government.  Big business is my enemy.  Business people desperate for money.  And let me tell you, they are way worse than the government.  You're a friggin' madman.  You're crazy.  It's a conspiracy.  I went to the studio today.  Robin was preparing the news.  I told Artie to stir the sauce.  Keep stirring the sauce. 
[00:17:30]  I had to go out and get some show prep.  So I got in my car, my limo, actually.  The limo driver was taking me around.  And I looked up and a black helicopter was following me.  Obviously hired by terrestrial radio.  But I had things to do.  I had to get out to the Hamptons and make sure they got the money for the new Howey Mansion out in the Hamptons.  So I drove out there.  And the builder wasn't ready with my Howey Mansion yet.  So I hopped back in the Howey limo and drove back.  And there were more helicopters following me.  I called Artie to make sure he was still stirring the sauce. 
[00:18:00]  And I called Robin to make sure the show prep was.  Robin, what?  They're after me.  Because that's how it happened.  If it was a terrestrial person, I would have been dead.  I never would have seen him coming.  You paranoid ass.  This is called being funny.  So that's it, huh? 
[00:18:30]  That's it.  Half a billion dollars for a life.  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  It's a good system.  They took a lot of my listeners and cut it into little slivers.  And I got one.  So I went back to the studio and started trying to do the show.  But Artie was still stirring the sauce.  And Robin hadn't gotten done with the show prep.  And she needed her good luck hat. 
[00:19:00]  You paranoid schizo jackass.  It's our time to shine, mother effer.  No one is giving up.  You're done.  A flying one.  Start realizing it.  He is so scary.  Such a scary, scary person to terrestrial radio.  Do you realize how irrelevant you've become? 
[00:19:30]  Could you step out from the ivory tower and your yes people and look around at reality for a second?  Could you leave a polo match?  So I went to the polo match.  And I put a bet down.  I don't even know if you can bet on polo.  But I bet anyway.  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  We had a bunch of old tapes that I wanted to play. 
[00:20:00]  But Robin panicked and flushed them down the toilet.  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  We needed those tapes, Robin.  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  What are we going to do now?  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Oh, they were going to find them, Howard.  No, they weren't, Robin.  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Unbelievable.  You're paranoid.  This is driving you crazy and you're splitting at the seams. 
[00:20:30]  And we love watching it.  Oh, I love watching it.  We love watching it.  The deconstruction of a once great legend.  Is that the terrestrial helicopter following me, Robin?  The black helicopter is following me.  Oh, wait.  No, that is Robin.  Oh.  Artie and Robin in the limo.  Under an overpass. 
[00:21:00]  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Anyway.  All right.  We should take our first break.  We'll continue with the article.  Got to play the audio because that's what set me off.  Oh, yeah.  We'll do that after the break as well.  Definitely.  Jackass.  He also talked about our Letterman appearance again.  Yeah.  Actually, Artie chimed in this time.  That's where that fat son of a bitch Artie chimed in and should have kept his mouth full of food  instead of spewing bullcrap about our Letterman appearance. 
[00:21:30]  If it sucked so bad, you tub of crap, you fat bastard.  If it sucked so bad, how come a minute after our appearance was done, they asked us back?  If we were bombing so bad like you said.  Don't kiss his ass.  You have a career, you idiot.  People actually enjoy what you do.  Don't sit there and be this idiot's yes man as he comes apart at the seams, 
[00:22:00]  hanging on by your fingernails, you fat bastard.  Oh, now I just can't stand him either.  I used to enjoy him on the roasts and stuff.  Now he's just, now you just aggravated me by lying.  Lying for your boss that is an irrelevant old woman.  He finally drank the Kool-Aid.  Yeah.  He finally drank it.  Drink the Kool-Aid, Artie.  He finally drank it.  What's the matter?  Not enough confidence in the movie?  You gotta go and start kissing that shriveled ass? 
[00:22:30]  Oh, crap.  Is that what you gotta do?  Maybe I don't have a movie career after all, so I better start kissing his ass.  A friend of mine had a, oh, it's always a friend of a friend of theirs,  and they happened to walk in and it was on.  I don't know what happened.  And we went to look at something else, and the DVR started playing Letterman.  I couldn't shut my eyes.  This is like the third or fourth time where they're talking about our Letterman appearance  and saying that, you know, I was at a friend's house and it just happened to be on.  They locked me in a room like Clockwork Orange and threw my eyes open and made me watch it. 
[00:23:00]  Gary told me that.  Gary told me.  Yeah, all right.  Whatever, Howard.  No one ever watched it.  It was really talked about.  It went really well.  We had a great time from beginning to end.  The audience loved it.  Letterman loved it.  We loved it.  It was a thrill of a lifetime.  And this fat son of a bitch has to crap on it for your boss?  Artie, you're savvy.  You know what a bombing is and what a good appearance is on a talk show.  Be honest at least. 
[00:23:30]  At least be honest about it.  You don't have to kiss his ass so much.  Everyone over there just smooching it.  Ugh.  Ew.  You doing the Robin impression again?  Yeah, yeah.  Ew.  That's all I'm good for.  That adds enough to the show, doesn't it?  There you go.  You better do more than that or you'll be back out in the plantation.  Howie won't keep you in the house where you can make a mint julep for the man.  That whole crew over there disgusts me. 
[00:24:00]  And when Howard quotes numbers and quotes the source, you're going to scream with laughter.  Trust me when you hear this audio.  Yeah, wait until you hear what he's bigger than.  Wait until you hear how many people are coming in by the day and what source he quotes.  Right.  We'll do the Howie math next.  Oh, Christ.  Thank you for giving us energy this morning, Howie.  Thank you.  Lunatic.  You had your time.  It was great. 
[00:24:30]  But it's now our time.  Everyone knows it.  It's driving you nuts.  Jesus.  Hello, Jimmy.  How's your coffee?  It's good.  It's good.  All right.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  It's time for another Opie and Anthony show.  Scream along.  Shut up. 
[00:25:00]  Shut up.  Okay.  Terrific.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  ONA uncut and live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:25:30]  All of the radio rips me up.  All of the radio rips me up.  All of the radio rips me up.  Talk on and on about how you invented radio.  Don't, Fred.  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  Robin.  Hoo, hoo, Robin.  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  Robin.  Robin.  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  Robin.  Right, Robin?  Tell him, Fred.  Tell him, Fred.  I invented everything.  Put a bandana on your car.  Sirius sucks ass. 
[00:26:00]  Beyond AM.  Beyond FM.  XM.  Satellite Radio.  That's right.  Good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Yes, it is.  We got a lot of energy this morning.  Uh, Howie Hater from Atlanta on the instant feedback.  We got a lot of people reacting right now, Anthony.  Uh, he writes, no doubt Howie is clueless, but why reward him with all this airtime?  I'll tell you why.  At this point, it's just great material for the Opie and Anthony show.  Exactly.  The guy's losing it and it's being documented on audio. 
[00:26:30]  And for any, uh, asshole that wants to, uh, uh, perk up and say, oh, you can't even go  a day without talking about him.  It's, uh, we're at the point nowadays, we only talk about him in response to when he  talks about us.  That's how it works now.  So when you hear us talking about him, it's because, uh, he's spouted off about us.  But you probably didn't hear that, that part of it, because not many people are listening. 
[00:27:00]  And that's just a fact.  Phone number 1-866-313-4E-LOL, Jimmy Norton in studio with us.  Funny man, Jim Norton.  Funny.  The hyphen.  Hello, Flint, Michigan.  Ugh.  Hey, we're on to Flint.  Oh, wow.  Our career is just taking off.  Don't you diss Flint.  Conquering all the AMs across America.  Wow.  We're just like Sean Hannity.  Flint, Michigan.  What's wrong with Flint?  And the agent all excited.  Guess what?  I got you a new affiliate.  Oh, yeah? 
[00:27:30]  Is it LA?  Uh, well, uh.  Is it LA?  Uh, it's, uh, Flint, Michigan.  Ah, that's kind of cool.  Uh, it's on a, it's on an AM.  People are going to hear us at the big car amusement park that we saw in Michael Moore's movie.  I don't know.  Oh, God, was that hysterical.  That amusement park based on cars.  We're going to weed out the Flint, Michigan listeners right away.  I was watching my home be just, were you, fat boy? 
[00:28:00]  We beat up our own.  The guy that just goes around.  Enjoy it.  I like to say hi to the guy that just went around kicking people out of their houses on Christmas.  Yeah, we should have interviewed him.  I'm just doing my job.  We should have interviewed him yesterday, first day on in Flint, Michigan.  Yeah.  So back to FMQB.  Howard Stern claims to be victim of a smear campaign.  Smear.  The article continues with, uh, this.  Meanwhile, Stern also discussed XM Satellite Radio slash CBS Radio personalities.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  Hey, slash.  Uh, Opie and Anthony addressing the duo's appearance on The Late Show with David Letterman, in which they discussed the gag order Stern had placed on them while both were employed by Infinity Broadcasting. 
[00:28:30]  Stern said he didn't feel their free speech was interrupted, but rather that he shut down someone that was trying to hone in on his action.  More paranoia.  Hone in on his action?  Hey, jerk off.  We were working for the same company in different day parts.  You were doing mornings.  We were doing afternoons.  How are we honing in on your action?  How the hell were we honing in? 
[00:29:00]  Paranoia.  We saw all this.  As people start seeing him unravel, unravel, this is the stuff we saw years ago when it was starting.  The guy's a psycho.  He is a friggin' psychopath.  A lunatic.  Apparently, in need of therapy every day, he's that crazy.  Oh, yeah.  Well, because he was a bad husband, a bad father.  Yeah.  And what does he do? 
[00:29:30]  A horrendous boss doesn't even treat his own employees right?  No.  It's legendary in the business.  Just enough.  That's right.  A bad father.  I can't begrudge him that.  Kids stink.  I'd be an awful father.  Shut up.  Leave me alone.  I'm selfish.  I'd be a good uncle, though.  A narcissistic egomaniac.  There you go.  That's a good one.  Thank you, Jimmy.  It works.  I don't care if you badmouth me, said Stern, while reminiscing of the past events with O&A. 
[00:30:00]  What I care about is that you're ripping me off blindly and not even being appreciative  of my career.  You know, and more lies there.  The second we came into New York, we did nothing but praise the guy.  The guy never is able to hear other radio personalities give him praise.  He doesn't hear it.  Well, because if he hears that, then he has nothing to do on a stupid show.  He's deaf to it.  This whole bit has been how everyone's ripping him off and how the government is preventing  him from doing the show he's capable of doing. 
[00:30:30]  So if you finally admit, all right, yeah, O&A did give me my props, then there goes a  whole chunk of his show.  Yeah.  I've said it before.  Some of the most amazing radio I've ever heard was from his show years ago.  Years ago.  And then he continues.  When somebody is a thief, you put them in jail.  I said, put them in jail.  Let's see how they do when they can't talk about me.  You took your first pinch like a man.  Put us in jail? 
[00:31:00]  Paul, we're in jail.  What?  What are you talking about?  By the way, we did just fine when we couldn't talk about you, Howard.  Yeah.  Believe me.  You know that.  Everyone else knows that.  This past March was the first time Stern had talked of the behind the scenes wrangling  with O&A admitting to it in an interview with Sean Hannity saying, that's right.  I believe in censoring anyone who is my enemy.  I believe in censorship when it benefits me.  Yeah.  There you go.  That's the that's his mindset. 
[00:31:30]  Censorship when it benefits him.  We weren't his enemy.  No.  He's his own enemy.  Same company.  Different day part.  He was morning.  We were afternoon.  Where is this competition?  But even if even if it was there, it doesn't matter.  You can't do that.  You can't make tell the people that you can't say this about me.  Yeah.  You can't.  So go in.  So go in.  Go in.  And go in.  I had to.  Oh.  This. 
[00:32:00]  It's not working.  What happened?  Of course it's not.  What's wrong with the button?  E-Rock screwed it all up.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'm sitting there.  I saw you.  Jelly and tuna.  So I called up Ronnie, the limo driver, and he took me to Mel Carmisen's office at that  time.  I looked up.  There was a black helicopter.  It was terrestrial radio chasing me around.  I had to talk to Mel Carmisen.  It was something about a silencers.  No, it was silencing two radio idiots.  That's what it was.  So I went to talk to him, very busy, and told him they had to shut up because they're talking 
[00:32:30]  about me.  Even though we're in different day parts and working for the same company, they were ripping  me off.  It's a conspiracy.  Then I hopped back in to go see if Artie was still stirring the sauce.  Apparently, the fat bastard ate all the sauce, sausage, and pasta.  Then I said, Robin.  There's Robin.  Robin, do you have the news ready?  I'm a very busy man.  You paranoid, schizoid ass. 
[00:33:00]  Quick car.  Pull in the garage.  Pull in the garage.  They're following me.  Terrestrial radio.  In helicopters.  I see Opie and Anthony in helicopters, Robin.  All right.  Stern also said he got a call from Letterman producer Rob Barnett asking if he cared about  the ONA booking, to which he stated, I've never interfered in anybody's career. 
[00:33:30]  No, huh?  Never, huh?  And didn't block the appearance.  This news had come out before the appearance by ONA on Letterman's show, to which the duo  challenged Stern to block the appearance if he could.  But ONA say they have been asked back by Letterman's people for a second appearance  this December, which is the God's honest truth.  Waiting on an official date, by the way.  Yeah.  We were told right after the show.  Because we bond so bad.  All right.  You ready for the big laugh in the morning? 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  This is great stuff.  Howard is bigger than blank.  Well, you know the answer.  Do you know the answer?  I know the answer.  Wait.  Wait.  Howard is bigger than blank.  If this was a special that we taped last night from like Bellevue or some other mental  institution, and this was a person blurting out stuff strapped to a bed with medication  going in, you would be laughing your ass off. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  Because what he says is so utterly ridiculous, it's comedic.  I was the victim of yet another smear campaign.  I can't tell you how interesting this ride to satellite and Howard TV, Howard On Demand  has been for me personally.  Oh, it's interesting.  He thought it was going to be a lot better than it is.  Dude, he thought it was going to be huge.  That it's a slow build. 
[00:35:00]  XM is doing great.  Yep.  Not trashing anyone in Washington, but the reality is, as far as having a big, huge show  in New York, I'll just go with New York.  Yeah.  It's a very, very slow build.  Yep.  It will take years.  He will never get up to the level he was when he was doing commercial radio in New York.  Never.  And it's going to take many, many years to get some kind of an actual presence in the  New York market.  That's if.  That's the reality of satellite radio.  If that company lasts. 
[00:35:30]  They, Howard doesn't seem to know that the big story, all the press he was getting, all  the promotion he was getting wasn't because he was going to satellite.  He thought that was going to continue and all the people would come with him.  It was because he was leaving regular radio.  That's what the stories were about.  Wasn't about, wow, he's going to satellite.  This is great.  It's no, he's leaving regular radio. 
[00:36:00]  So once that was done, there's no story.  I can't do the accent, but Johnny from Baton Rouge, a victim of the modern age, poor, poor  Howie, poor Howie, I'm a victim of the modern age, good evening.  And then Don the Trucker, who tried the Kool-Aid, Don the Trucker from Whack Bag, interesting  equals not successful.  Right. 
[00:36:30]  Interesting equals not successful.  Picking his words very wisely.  It's interesting.  Is it?  I, uh, this whole, uh, satellite thing is interesting.  Being a father is interesting too, right, Howie?  Why am I alone?  Dope.  Uh.  A horrendous husband.  So now he's hanging with a face.  Ah, that'll get you places.  There you go.  You dope.  Bigger than. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, yeah.  Bigger than what?  Jimmy?  Uh, U.S. Steel.  We're bigger than U.S. Steel.  Your father.  I, uh, was the victim of yet another smear campaign.  I, uh.  I can't tell you how interesting this ride to satellite.  Unsuccessful.  Howard TV, Howard on demand has been for me personally.  Unsuccessful.  You know, now I am a big threat to terrestrial radio, evidently.  And to satellite radio, uh, XM in particular.  In particular. 
[00:37:30]  Which other one is there?  Uh, uh, big threat to satellite radio.  Uh, XM in particular.  As opposed to the one I work for, which I'm also a threat to because they pay me so much  money.  Hey, there was something.  In particular.  There was something called the Howard factor when he went to satellite.  That is so over now.  XM is relaxing.  Yeah.  The stock went, uh, way up yesterday afternoon.  They're noticing a trend there that it's just not quite, uh, they're not bringing in as  many subscribers as they thought.  Right.  And as they were. 
[00:38:00]  Right.  There was that initial push and that was absolutely expected by everybody.  Uh, he expected more.  I've talked to a lot of people who say like, yeah, I was going to go, but then like, I  just didn't do it because it was the holidays.  And all of a sudden it's like three months.  I'm like, all right.  And people like, yeah, who cared?  One guy, uh, emailed and said he was a huge fan, um, but just never got it.  Like wanted to never got it.  And then decided, eh, you know, I found something else.  I got a six CD player. 
[00:38:30]  Listen to other stuff.  Yeah.  Either CDs or other radio stations or, or something else.  Might even get satellite radio.  A lot of people then decide you want to listen to something else in the morning.  It's what, it's what happens.  People have their own tastes.  You weren't a God.  Sorry.  A big threat to terrestrial radio, evidently, and to satellite radio, uh, XM in particular.  We've been tremendously successful and continue to be.  Beyond my wildest expectations, wildest, beyond, all right, beyond his wildest expectations, 
[00:39:00]  10% of his 10 to 12 million listeners went over.  Yeah.  That is beyond his wildest.  My wildest expectation would be more people than you had.  18 gazillion people from multiple planets decided to subscribe.  Now, ships landed just because you went to satellite and, uh, subscribed. 
[00:39:30]  That's my wildest expectation.  My realistic expectation would be, I sure hope a lot of our listeners come over.  And that doesn't even, uh, add up to what happened.  And XM's not scared of you, Howie.  Oh.  The stock was upgraded yesterday.  Stop.  Dope.  Beyond my wildest expectations, when I sit in a meeting and, uh, they spell out to me  that this is growing faster than cell phones.  Ladies and gentlemen.  What? 
[00:40:00]  He's bigger than cell phones.  It's bigger than cell phones, Robin.  Ew.  I'm bigger than U.S. Steel.  The trucks.  The trucks that used to haul the huge serious equipment.  Your father's trucks.  We don't even have to try hard anymore.  This is, uh, just great stuff.  If there's half a billion dollars on the table, I'll know we'll have a deal. 
[00:40:30]  Cell phones were really popular.  Yeah, cell phones kind of took off.  Yeah.  I'm thinking it's, they're kind of like mood rings and hula hoops, where it's just a fad.  But right now, they're pretty popular.  Going faster than cell phones.  If you, I want, I want.  That's got to be a glitch.  I want to ask, I want to ask people on the street, maybe during the walkover.  Do you have, I'll even cover all of satellite radio. 
[00:41:00]  Okay.  You know, even though we're on XM, I'll cover it all.  I'll go, do you have satellite radio?  How about we do?  And do you have a cell phone?  How about we do iPod, cell phone, satellite radio?  And see which one.  On the street.  On the street.  Yeah.  Basic little.  Yeah.  Survey.  I'm bigger than AIDS in Africa, Robin.  AIDS is nothing compared to me.  Thank you, Smith and PA.  I can't take credit for that.  Yes, you can.  No, I can't do it.  Wow.  That's a great line.  Smith. 
[00:41:30]  Smith.  Oh, I'm bigger than AIDS in Africa.  Yeah, there you go.  I grabbed it, but I got to give you credit.  Thank you, Smith.  Ladies and gentlemen, this news just in.  I'm bigger than shoelaces.  There's more people listening to me than there are shoelaces.  I'm talking both pair.  Noah drives him nuts.  He knows that we're not scared of him, and we never were.  Everyone else in this stupid business were scared S-less.  Not many people are anymore.  Everyone was. 
[00:42:00]  I mean, anymore.  He's such a non-issue.  The fact that we are addressing him is a little silly, and I'll admit to that, but it's only because...  It's not silly.  It's great material.  Yeah, it's funny.  That's all we care about.  And when we first started goofing on Howard, it was great material back in the day.  Yeah, it's fun.  When we started noticing that he was turning into a Hollywood Howie, we're like, oh, this  is great fodder for our stupid radio show.  Years ago.  And that's all we were doing.  We were making fun of him and Imus and everybody else in the market, stupid Scott and Todd and 
[00:42:30]  Rocky Allen at the time, and he was the only one that couldn't take it.  The only one.  I'm bigger than cell phones.  Well, let's hear that again.  When I sit in a meeting and they spell out for me that this is growing faster than cell  phones, when I'm adding 6,000 new subscribers a day, as Bubba pointed out.  Wait, wait, wait.  All right.  That was the line that killed me.  When we're adding 6,000 new listeners a day, as Bubba pointed out.  Oh, he said as Bubba?  Dude!  I didn't hear that part.  I didn't know. 
[00:43:00]  Head financial advisor, Bubba?  What is...  Who is...  Where is...  When is...  Another one that has to lick his ass.  Who the hell?  Wait.  6,000 a day times 30 would be 180,000 a month.  Right.  What's 180,000 times 12?  That'd be 1,800,000 plus 360,000, a little over 2 million, maybe?  Yeah.  Maybe 5,000...  6,000?  Yes. 
[00:43:30]  42...  What'd you say?  Six times...  I'd do 42,000 a week.  Well, yeah, okay, 42,000...  So over 2 million a year.  Just over 2 million a year.  But cell phones are growing faster than that.  The cell phones, there's a lot more than 2 million cell phones.  I would think so.  No.  Well, a lot more than 2 million cell phones a year.  First of all...  Being turned on, of course.  I think the SEC ought to take interest in the fact that he's blurting out numbers.  Right.  There's no way.  We know this business.  There's no way. 
[00:44:00]  Stop it.  You could add 6,000 a day...  A day.  ...for one radio show.  And he's talking about...  On satellite radio.  Yeah, he's talking about, you know, him.  He's responsible, first of all, for every sub that they have.  Right.  He's taken credit for every sub that they've had since he's gone on board.  Maybe the company's growing that fast.  Maybe.  I don't know.  It's just natural that the company, yeah, is growing.  It's getting subs.  They're not all attributed to him.  But he does the Howie math and make it sound like there are 6,000 people a day signing up just to listen to him. 
[00:44:30]  And that's just not true.  That is just a downright lie.  I just got to check a text on my serious unit.  All right.  We're going to have to do one more break on this because there's even better audio.  Wait, wait, wait.  It's official.  We just passed the mark.  I'm bigger than toilet paper.  I'm actually bigger than...  And I'm talking each square on the roll.  You...  Oh, you psycho.  When I sit in a meeting and they spell out for me that this is growing faster than cell phones. 
[00:45:00]  When I'm adding 6,000 new subscribers a day, as Bubba pointed out.  When I'm adding.  He said, when I'm adding...  When I'm adding.  More than 6,000, as Professor Bubba has pointed out, the chief financial officer of Sirius, Bubba.  He got away with his lies for so, so many years.  So many years.  Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to now bring up a very important man to the convention here. 
[00:45:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Bubba.  It's a plot.  Mr. Bubba was going to now release subscriptions for the year.  Is he?  So is that official?  I guess it's official.  Is that out now on Wall Street?  He's bigger than cell phones.  He alone is bringing in 6,000 a day?  All right.  Take that as official?  There you go.  Maybe Securities and Exchange Commission ought to look into those numbers that Howie's just blurting out over the air. 
[00:46:00]  All right.  Why don't we take another break?  We have just a few more clips to go.  Because he can't just spew this crap without us reacting.  By the way, he should friggin' thank us.  This is the most people that have heard his voice since he left.  In what, nine months?  The most people right now are hearing Howie's voice that have heard him since he left radio.  Yes.  Sam walked in with an interesting stat. 
[00:46:30]  As of 1999, 1999 to 2001, there were 86.1 million cell phones in the U.S. alone.  In the U.S. alone.  I'm just trying to do a little bit of math.  Bigger than cell phones.  And those numbers have to be even larger now that it's too close.  Coincidentally enough, I invented the cell phone.  Right.  Dude, there's China.  So I'm fighting myself.  There's China.  There's China.  That says it all, dude.  There's China and Japan. 
[00:47:00]  Just pick a small little country.  Oh, he is too friggin' much.  He's lost his mind, people.  It's too obvious.  He's barely growing faster than Flint, Michigan.  The only virus spreading across America.  There we go.  You got a war face?  What the F?  Ah!  That's a war face.  Now let me see your war face.  Oh! 
[00:47:30]  You didn't convince me.  Let me see your real war face.  No!  You don't scare me.  Work on it.  Jackass.  Opie and Anthony.  I'm scared.  I'm scared.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:48:00]  Hope you're enjoying the festivities.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  We love doing radio.  We still have the passion to do radio.  It's fun-erific.  Uh, here's the clip again,  because we did a little research in the ONA lab,  didn't we, Anthony?  Yes, it didn't take long.  Believe me.  Here's the clip again.  Beyond my wildest expectations,  when I sit in a meeting and they spell out for me  that this is growing faster than cell phones,  when I'm adding 6,000 new subscribers a day, 
[00:48:30]  as Bubba pointed out.  Professor Bubba.  He's growing faster than cell phones.  Let's look at, uh...  6,000 people a day are signing up for satellite radio  just to listen to him,  which is just a flat-out lie.  Let's look at some of the numbers here.  The number of mobile subscribers worldwide  reached over 2 billion by the end of 2005,  so that doesn't even include this year. 
[00:49:00]  2 billion cell phones.  That's a lot of growth.  That's a lot of growth.  Well, in all fairness,  cell phones have been around a little longer  than satellite radio.  And growing faster.  Now, here it is.  Yeah.  Um, 2 billion.  So, by the end of 2011,  it's predicted to rise to 3.96 billion.  Almost 4.  So, let's call it about 4.  Double to 4 billion. 
[00:49:30]  Adding about 2 billion in 6 years.  Do you think in 6 years  there will be 2 billion subscribers  to the Howard Stern radio show?  No.  No.  Do you honestly...  Faster than cell phones?  You lunatic!  In our lifetime,  between the two companies,  they won't reach 1 billion.  No. 
[00:50:00]  I mean, it would be fantastic.  Oh, my God.  It would be wonderful.  We would be sitting here going,  my God, this is amazing.  At that point,  we could say that we are truly  more popular than God.  Dude.  So, from right now,  till 2011,  which will grow faster?  Howard's show  or satellite radio?  Satellite, we've said,  will add about 2 billion  cell phones. 
[00:50:30]  In 6 years.  Yeah.  6 short years.  Yeah.  2 billion cell phones.  Howie,  how many listeners?  That's a lot.  Isn't that like 300 million a year?  What?  Figure out how many a year.  1.8 billion.  So,  a little over 300 million  new cell phones a year.  And we did the math.  The other one was like 2 million  a year.  Yeah.  But that's not accurate.  But his numbers aren't accurate  to begin with.  No,  it's Howie math. 
[00:51:00]  It's what we call Howie math.  We've been on to his Howie math  for a long time.  Yeah.  Whatever numbers need to be drawn in  to make it work out his way  is called Howie math.  Unfortunately,  when you have a microphone  in front of you,  people just assume you're an expert.  So when you spew out numbers,  it has to be real  because they're listening  to it through a radio.  But he's been doing Howie math  his entire career.  All right,  on to the next clip.  We really want to move on  to other things.  There was just so much  of this today. 
[00:51:30]  We were supposed to talk  to The Rock at this point  and now there's a whole thing  going on behind the scenes  because we'd rather do this  for a little longer.  A to-do.  Yes,  but this is just way too fresh.  Here's the next clip.  Every expert predicted  that we would do poorly.  In fact,  terrestrial radio...  You know what?  Wait a minute.  I'm going to throw him a bone.  No.  That's not true.  They didn't.  The experts said  that you were going to do very well.  Going to do well.  Uncensored.  He had a huge fan base. 
[00:52:00]  All the experts came out  and said this is a great move.  He's going to do very well.  What happened was  the experts realized  that he didn't do as well  as the experts thought  he was going to do.  Yep.  My thing is  would Sirius have spent  a half a billion  if the experts all said  it wasn't going to go good?  Yeah,  exactly.  Probably not.  We talked to all the experts.  They said it won't go.  Yeah,  experts are in on the conspiracy.  I got the music cued,  so...  Every expert predicted  that we would do poorly.  In fact,  terrestrial radio 
[00:52:30]  is so scared  of this broadcast  and what we're doing here  that they've even hired  a full-time publicist  to make sure  to slander,  to disparage me,  to try to make me  look like a failure.  Part of me doesn't give a shit  and the other part of me  always will  because I'm not going to  allow people to say  things about me  that aren't true,  but I'm in the middle  of this one  and I'll straighten it out  I guess by getting  some facts out there.  Part of me  wants to say 
[00:53:00]  who cares.  The other part of me  does care.  So the part of me  that cares  got into the limo  with Ronnie.  All right,  we drove down the street.  All I could do  was pay attention.  The helicopter's back,  Robin.  The helicopter's back.  It's terrestrial radio.  They're following you,  Howie.  They're following me out.  They're following you.  To the Hamptons,  Ronnie,  to the Hamptons.  I got to get to my retreat  out in the Hamptons.  That's where everybody is.  I got to get my old tapes.  I got to bring them  to Sirius  and play them  because I'm going on vacation  for 18 weeks. 
[00:53:30]  It's great.  But the listeners  won't care  because I'll play  the old tapes.  But I got to go  get the old tapes.  And I get there  and the old tapes  aren't there.  So I call Artie  and make sure  he's still stirring  the sauce  and adding the sausage.  But he's left.  He went to do  some movie  that no one's going to see.  Robin, is that you?  Robin, get the news together.  So Robin's getting  the news together  that no one seems  to care about anymore.  And I just have her in here  to get her off the plantation  so I can talk 
[00:54:00]  about black people.  Who?  Keeps the FCC off of me.  But I don't have to worry  about the FCC anymore.  The government even.  I don't have to worry  about them anymore.  Now I'm worrying  about Terrestrial Radio  but I really don't care.  It's big business,  Howie.  Big business.  They're all after me.  They're following you  in their trucks.  Let me tell you  what they've done.  Terrestrial Radio  has hired,  personally hired  a publicist.  All of them  got together.  First, they played  the Sabruta film,  talked about  the assassination  that they were behind  of Kennedy  and then decided  to put this 
[00:54:30]  smear campaign  against me.  Howie,  9-11 is a conspiracy  too.  You know that, right?  You know,  people that are out  to get me  are growing faster  than me  and I'm growing  faster than cell phones.  And Artie is  growing faster  than Jupiter.  Why am I alone? 
[00:55:00]  Oh, is he out  of his mind?  This just in.  What the hell is this?  A horse is following me.  Why is a horse  following me?  It's...  Oh, hi Beth.  This just in.  Lon from Georgia.  I heard that  instead of the  Freedom Towers,  they're going to  build the Howie Towers  where the World Trade  Center used to stand.  Howard Stern  bigger than iPods. 
[00:55:30]  Learn it.  Howie is bigger  than cell phones  in Ethiopia.  That's Stu Pitt  in Jersey.  Yeah, don't pick  cell phones when you  want to say something  that you're bigger than.  Guys, you just missed  a qualifier.  He was bigger than  cell phones in  1980.  Oh, okay.  There you go.  Well, he was, right.  Bigger than cell phones  in 1980.  Big show. 
[00:56:00]  Not many cell phones.  Pick something that grows  a little slower than  cell phones,  like cancer cells.  How about something  harder to research?  We're growing faster  than people that  collect Lionel trains.  Because, you know,  we'd have interns  going crazy going,  I can't find the  Lionel train stats.  Cell phones.  Two clicks.  And you know how many  cell phones are sold.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Moving on, 
[00:56:30]  because we're going  to try to do  other stuff today  with the radio show.  Yes.  Then they got into  the Letterman appearance  again.  Yeah, this is where  a fat idiot  who should keep  his yap shut  already chimes in  to kiss a little ass.  I don't know why.  I really don't know why.  The guy's a funny comic.  And he stayed out of it  for the most part.  He did stay out of it.  I don't know why  he's jumping in now  all of a sudden.  I enjoyed  when he used to  goof on  putting each of us 
[00:57:00]  with different  radio personalities.  That was kind of funny.  You know,  his roasts.  I think it's funny  when he's on roasts,  things like that.  He's a talented guy,  a talented comic.  He doesn't need  to jump in  and just jump  on the bandwagon  because you just  see your boss  unraveling like this.  Everyone sees  the truth  that's around him.  He's, I think,  just delusional  and insane  and really believes  this stuff.  But everyone else 
[00:57:30]  has to go like,  be a little nervous  about, you know,  subscriptions,  things like that.  So, I mean,  you don't have to  jump on the bandwagon  and kiss his ass  this hard.  Our Letterman appearance  was amazing.  Believe me,  I was nervous as hell  that we were going to bomb.  I'd have been  the first one.  I consider myself  a pretty realistic,  humble guy  when it comes to  the show  and what we do.  And I'm pretty realistic  if things went well  or didn't go well.  That Letterman appearance 
[00:58:00]  went better than  anyone could have.  We couldn't ask for better.  Better than my wildest  expectation.  Right.  And there's pictures  of us before Letterman  in like the Escalade  and in the dressing room  and stuff.  And you can see  that we're just  freaked out,  nervous.  Yeah.  We'll admit that,  of course.  Anyone going on Letterman  for the first time,  especially,  of course you're going  to be freaked out.  It's a huge moment.  And then there's video  of us coming out  of Letterman  and it's a completely  different scene.  You see us all  relaxed and happy  because we know  it went well.  Sat right down, 
[00:58:30]  got right into it  with him,  talked about our show,  talked about our  various firings.  It was a get-to-know session.  Talked about Opie  being a lunatic.  Talked about,  there were so many things.  And then Dave  brought up the Howard thing.  Of course he had to.  It wasn't to bail out  the segment.  We played the segment.  It was to,  because it was such,  such a like bug  up our ass  that Howard had said  that he could,  you know,  shut the appearance down.  That he felt qualified 
[00:59:00]  to bring it up.  That he wanted  to bring it up.  That's fine.  And Howard had been  on Letterman  so many times,  I guess he wanted  to kind of cement  their relationship  a little bit.  Maybe throw a couple  of jabs at us  to see how we'd  respond to it.  And the response  got an overwhelming  yay.  People loved it.  Yeah,  they were only going  to give us  four or five minutes.  It was going to be  a quick little,  you know,  segment.  Really quick.  Talk about what  we're up to and all that.  And it wasn't a man-cow  type sitting there 
[00:59:30]  bashing Howard thing.  No.  It was funny  because people  related to it.  They saw me  goofing on Howard  the way they know  he should be goofed on.  Like he invented  everything.  People know  you're ridiculous.  They know that  whole concept  that you invented  everything is ridiculous.  That's why they were laughing.  Going into it,  we decided to keep it fun.  So even when Howard  came up,  you know,  Letterman really  wanted to get into it.  We're like,  you know what?  No.  Nope. 
[01:00:00]  Let's keep it fun.  And Ant diffused  the situation  by doing like  a dead-on Howard.  It diffused it.  Letterman's laughing  his ass off.  The audience went nuts  and we kept it fun.  And light.  Like we wanted to.  Like the show.  And like I said,  the segment was only  supposed to be  four or five minutes.  If you were in the audience,  you saw  produce pieces  that they were going  to run that night.  And they got huge laughs  from the audience.  Huge laughs.  They cut all that out  and gave us 11 minutes.  They restructured commercials.  They restructured  the whole show 
[01:00:30]  to give us more time  because that's how  well it went.  Yeah.  These are the facts.  Those are facts.  It was on YouTube.  Everyone was checking it out.  But unfortunately,  something about copyright,  they took it down.  But you know,  many, many people  saw it for themselves.  We were on for 11 minutes.  You don't do 11 minutes  on David Letterman  if the appearance sucks.  If you're stinking.  Stinking it up.  No, they chop it up.  They chop the hell out of it.  But apparently,  Artie walked into  some Best Buy,  tripped over a DVR,  and the appearance came on.  And he saw it on one of the TVs 
[01:01:00]  while he was eating.  I can't get enough  of the dishonesty  out there in radio.  All a bunch of lying sacks.  We'll hopefully admit something  and go,  yeah, well,  we did see that  and it was good  and it really bothers us.  But it's always like,  I just happen to walk  into a room  or Gary told me  that they sucked  on Letterman.  I forgot it.  Someone told him  and he told me  and I...  Howard saw our Letterman appearance.  He saw it.  It's easy enough  to DVR things 
[01:01:30]  and then pop it on  when you're laying in bed  or something.  Right.  Just to check it out.  Especially if someone's  talking about you.  When we find out  that someone's talking about us,  we run and get the tape  immediately.  And...  Immediately.  Here's something else.  If someone tells you  that someone you don't like  bombed,  you can't get to that clip  fast enough.  You're right.  You cannot get to it  fast enough.  So if, you know,  Gary told him  and then Artie tells him  that we bombed  and flop sweat  and we're bombing,  I would want that tape 
[01:02:00]  in a second.  I'd be playing clips  on my show going,  listen to this bombing.  If we bombed,  would it be featured  on our website,  opianthony.com?  Look at us bomb.  Just more dishonest,  lying from a psychopath.  We pushed everyone  to YouTube  to check it out  before they got rid  of the videos  because of some  copyright thing.  Yeah.  It's just so dishonest.  You know,  I was over  at my friend's house  the other day  and he had taped  Opie and Anthony  on Letterman.  Okay?  And he goes,  oh, I bet Howard's 
[01:02:30]  all mad about this.  Did you see this?  I go, dude,  I don't think Howard  even knows about this  or cares really at all.  He doesn't know about it?  Hold on.  If he didn't know about it,  he wouldn't have gone  on and on  before we did the appearance  about how Letterman  was calling me  and they were asking me  if they wanted  these guys on their show.  You know,  asking my permission.  I don't care.  Didn't even know about it.  Trying to say  that he could have stopped it. 
[01:03:00]  Just more bull,  more crap.  And more people  trying to beat me up.  Well,  Anthony kept it fun.  You,  Letterman,  no talker,  didn't.  I got laughs.  I got laughs  on Letterman.  Laughs.  I didn't talk  as much as Anthony,  no.  But I was very happy  with everything  that went down.  It was about  this or cares really  at all.  It's not on his radar  but he goes,  you got to watch  what they say about him.  So I watched the,  I see the radar  don't work on a sunken ship.  They are tanking. 
[01:03:30]  By the way,  when his friend,  when his friend said,  you got to watch  what he said about Howard,  he basically said  it was really funny  but I already can't say  that in front of Howard.  It was pretty good.  Yeah,  his friend is saying  Howard must be livid.  You got to see  what they say about Howard.  Right.  Ah,  nothing.  Watch the,  I see their appearance.  Right.  How was it?  They are tanking.  And then Howard  is sitting there,  well,  how was it?  He knows how it was.  He saw it a few times.  Can you be honest,  please,  for a second. 
[01:04:00]  Appearance.  Right.  How was it?  They are tanking so bad.  I mean,  it's like,  it's douche chill  and they have bombs  going on.  By the way,  that's the only time  Robin pipes up.  Wow.  Can you go back  and cook us some pancakes?  Go back  and make us some flapjacks  and a mint julep  lest you not be allowed  in the house.  Oh,  you're token.  That's the only reason  you're there.  By the way,  Fast Freddy from Jamaica Station  and talked more than cell phones 
[01:04:30]  on Letterman.  That's right.  They are tanking.  That's so bad.  I mean,  it's like,  it's douche chill  and they have bomb sweat on them  and Letterman doesn't know  what to do  and he threw them  a life server,  in my opinion,  by mentioning you.  He goes,  okay,  now what about your fight  with Howard Stern?  You could almost hear  the audience get interested  and gave them a platform  to actually get a response.  They were really like,  they were just being so dull  and it's a smaller version  of what you're talking about 
[01:05:00]  right now.  You are,  you're a newsmaker.  You're a guy who  No,  you're not.  Oh,  stop it.  See,  that's how they're going to  spin a great appearance  on Letterman.  That's how Artie's going to  spin a great appearance  and we sucked  until we got it  or Anthony especially  got a huge reaction  with the Howard stuff.  That's how you spin it?  What a jerk.  Bombing,  believe me,  if we were bombing,  I'd have been the first to know.  I'd have been sitting there going,  oh my God,  we're bombing.  Now,  you know what it is?  It's like when you see  your friend's ex-girlfriend 
[01:05:30]  and she's banging  a much hotter guy  and you got to go back  and tell him about it.  Yeah.  You're never going to go,  dude,  boy,  did she upgrade from you.  Oh,  dude,  the guy,  he couldn't even do  half the stuff you could do.  She wasn't satisfied.  She faked the whole thing.  Yeah,  his dumb chiseled jaw,  just off.  Yeah,  and then,  I forget who told me,  they said that  the big Opie and Anthony thing  is to go around saying  how I shut them down  when they were on  Terrestrial Radio  and that's their fight  now in life because  It's not our fight in life.  How about you admitted it 
[01:06:00]  on Sean Hannity,  you jackass.  How about that?  Our big thing is to go around.  You said it on Hannity.  Stupid us for telling the world  that you did this to us  behind the scenes.  And Hannity  pulled it right out of you.  That's really dumb.  Give credit where credit's due.  Hannity just kept pounding him  about it  and he came through  and finally said,  yeah,  yeah,  I did.  And that's their fight  now in life  because,  you know,  their free speech  was interrupted.  You know,  I saw it a whole different way. 
[01:06:30]  I'm working for a company  where these guys come in  to hone in on my action  where they're being  shoved down my throat.  That's a mess, eh?  And, uh...  How are we shoved down  his throat?  Shoved down your throat.  They finally found  another successful radio show  in the company.  Threw us on in afternoons.  We were on the same stations  in a lot of cities.  Yeah.  And those stations  were doing great.  Very successful.  We weren't taking listeners  from him.  He had massive ratings  in these cities  and we had massive ratings  in afternoon drive.  People got to drive home  from work.  They were listening to us. 
[01:07:00]  We didn't hone in on crap.  The guy doesn't like  anyone doing well  in the backyard.  We made you work harder,  I'll tell you that much.  Because we were starting  to get a huge buzz in New York  until we effed it all up.  Well,  we shoved down my throat.  Right.  And,  uh,  the company comes to me  and says,  what do I think?  And I said,  I don't give a ****  who you put on this chat,  this,  these radio stations,  but,  uh,  it's all out war for me  when some guys  who do this.  It was all out war?  Really? 
[01:07:30]  Really?  You gotta fight.  You look like  the biggest pussy out there.  There's no excuse  for ever silencing guys  who you're more powerful  than at a company.  There's no artistic excuse.  Nope.  For doing that.  He blamed Don Imus  for the same thing.  For the same thing  at NBC.  Because Don Imus  was the big dog  over there  and Howard was doing  afternoons  when he first got there.  and,  uh,  he blamed Imus  for the same exact thing.  And believe me, 
[01:08:00]  Imus didn't do  half the stuff  that Howard did  behind the scenes.  Believe me.  But if someone's  stealing from you  and someone's doing that,  why don't you just  destroy them on the air?  Right?  Yeah.  Like,  publicly.  We do it all the time.  Doing it behind the scenes  is almost protecting you.  He did it with Mark and Brian.  He did it with,  uh,  DiBella.  We were gonna have any of that.  He did it with a lot of jocks  right there on the radio.  Just destroyed them.  Us?  Why?  Why?  Really think about that.  Why didn't he just  take us on on the air?  Hmm?  Like he did 
[01:08:30]  to so many other jocks.  Because he was scared  and he didn't know  how to fight us.  Everyone knows that.  Everyone knows that.  So he ran to Mel.  Ran crying to Mel.  And Mel called us  in a meeting  out of our goddamn vacation  and told us,  knock it off  or you're fired.  Uh,  and if that doesn't work,  uh,  I'll fire your bosses.  I'll fire everyone around you.  That's,  those are the threats  that were made  because of,  uh,  because Howie couldn't take it. 
[01:09:00]  From someone's cell phone,  Opie,  did Howard put a gag order  on you for Letterman?  Oh.  Brian from Georgia.  That was very hurtful.  Extremely hurtful.  He just didn't have  a cell phone yet.  It really does hurt  because I wanted  to talk a little more.  I'm bigger than YouTube.  I got to talk a lot  on Howie.  You should call me,  call it Howie Tube.  This,  these radio stations,  but, uh,  it's all out war for me  when some guys  Oh, is it?  Ooh, we're scared.  We're scared.  We're scared.  We're scared to have you.  I do and want to be  on the same stations  I have.  Bring it on. 
[01:09:30]  Bad-mouthing me.  I said,  so, um,  as far as I'm concerned,  I don't even care  if you bad-mouth me.  What I care about is  is that you're ripping me off  blindly  and,  and not even  being appreciative  of that career.  I said,  so when somebody  is a thief,  you put them in jail.  And I said,  put them in jail  and let's see how they do.  Let's see how they do  when they can't talk about me.  All right.  Well,  let me tell you,  and then you saw  they just exploded  because,  you know,  they went off  and I don't even,  he's blaming the fact 
[01:10:00]  that we couldn't talk  about him.  You're going to take credit  for us doing the  sex for Sam thing.  We were doing it  for three years running.  You jack off.  We were doing it  for three years running  that promotion.  And when we couldn't  talk about you,  we got very successful.  Very successful.  What a delusional.  He wants to take credit  for everything  that has happened  in radio  and in life itself.  And still think  he's there.  All right.  And the way 
[01:10:30]  he just says it  all the time,  never gave him credit.  Never.  That's a bunch of crap.  Did nothing  but give you credit  for what you brought  to radio over the years.  I would love to throw  a Howard Stern fan on.  Can't find one.  Can't find one  on the phone lines.  By the way,  even if you did  trash him,  you can't silence  people behind the scenes.  You can't run  to the boss  and silence people  in something like  a radio fight.  You can't do it, man.  Yeah, the average person  knows that.  That is like the worst  thing you could do. 
[01:11:00]  You could come across  like a crybaby.  You've got to wreck  people publicly.  That's what you do.  That's what you do.  That's right.  He knows the hotline.  Give us a call right now.  We'll discuss this, Howard.  We're sitting in your seat.  You should know the number.  Give us a call.  It used to be yours.  Give us a call.  When you had 12 million listeners.  I swear to God,  I'm not lying about this.  Letterman called.  When you say, 
[01:11:30]  I'm not lying about this.  Yeah.  You're lying.  It means you're lying about this.  Take a psych class.  They'll explain all this to you.  Now Letterman called.  When you start saying,  I don't care a lot  before you say something,  you actually care.  We even do it ourselves.  We'll go,  I don't care about that.  But we do.  Didn't last time it went  from Letterman's people called me  to someone at Letterman called me  to someone at Letterman called someone  at Stern's show.  Yeah.  Now he's going to do something else. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Let's hear what it is this time.  We have.  Yeah.  We have.  They don't like us talking about him,  but we have a couple of writers  that work for Letterman.  They are massive fans  of the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  We pulled them aside.  We're like,  dude,  what's the deal with this?  We want to get to the bottom of it.  And they said,  to the best of their knowledge,  it just didn't happen.  It just didn't happen.  I swear to God,  I'm not lying about this.  Letterman called me,  not Letterman,  Rob Burnett,  who produces it,  and said,  look, 
[01:12:30]  these guys are being pushed on us,  you know,  thrown down and pushed on us  by the executives at CBS.  They're desperate  to have them succeed on the radio.  Right.  You're a shot.  I,  I,  freaking Leno called us too,  you ass.  Yeah.  Ah,  forced on,  on them.  So forced that,  so forced.  A minute after we got back  to the dressing room,  we were invited back.  Right.  So forced that our four to five minute  appearance turned into 11 minutes.  executives at CBS.  They're,  they're desperate to have them succeed 
[01:13:00]  on the radio.  We don't know what to do.  We don't want to piss you off,  but how do you feel about them coming on?  I said,  I don't,  I said,  do whatever you want.  No one cares about you.  You have my blessing  to put anybody on you want.  And there's a short list  in the world  that would get a phone call  like that.  That's,  that's,  what are you already  shot of your yap?  So as far as me interfering  in anyone's career,  I've never interfered  in anybody's career.  You can go do whatever it is  you have to do.  Look,  they're working.  They're doing very well.  They're doing well.  You know,  that's it.  They're on the radio still. 
[01:13:30]  Have a party.  I mean,  I'm so happy.  We do every day.  I'm so not a part of their world  or man cow's world  or the guy  who supposedly  have a beef with me.  I don't even listen to them.  I don't know anything  about man cow.  I don't know anything  about Opie and Anthony.  I don't know anything  about them.  No,  you seem to.  I can only imagine,  you know,  like what Bubba said,  that whenever you say  I don't really know them,  I don't,  I haven't heard,  it must kill them.  I've never heard their show.  Oh,  shut up,  Robin.  Why does Bubba get  quoted?  And first of all,  Bubba was one of the 
[01:14:00]  ripoff,  idiot,  jerk offs  that you couldn't stand  that was a ripoff  and now he's your pal.  It doesn't,  why does everybody  quote Bubba?  Yeah.  Talk about this guy  like he's running  the whole ship.  According to Bubba,  I mean,  they're just delusional.  We didn't have a million  meetings about Howard  behind the scenes.  Howard said this,  Howard said that.  What's your story?  Didn't care.  You're trying to say  Howard doesn't know  about us.  Didn't listen,  doesn't know what we did.  Then how come you had us  dragged in front of the 
[01:14:30]  head of the company,  Mel Karmazin,  to tell us to shut up  about you?  How come?  What about the meeting  on January?  What was it?  Second?  Yeah.  We were called back  from vacation  and we were in Mel's  conference room  and he wanted to fire us  because we were talking  bad about your daughter.  Yeah,  some little incident  that happened.  At Jingle Ball.  Yeah,  remember?  We heard things,  whether it was alcohol,  pills,  we don't know.  We don't know.  How could this story?  We do know you were  in an emergency room  so we goofed on it. 
[01:15:00]  Never even mentioned  you or your daughter  but it was still  a major problem  that we were dragged  back from vacation  and almost fired  but you don't know  about us?  Robin,  he doesn't know  about us?  Never heard of him.  Trust me,  he knows about us.  Doesn't know anything  we did?  Trust me.  When we went down  to the Plaza Hotel  when he was having  a press conference  about that bomb  son of a beach  or whatever  and we went there  for the free food  and this was early on  we were just working  for the same company 
[01:15:30]  and we were invited  so like,  yeah,  we'll go for some  free food  and stuff  and Howard sat  in his limo  outside the Plaza Hotel  and refused to do  his freaking press conference  because we were inside  until we were removed.  But he doesn't know  about us,  right,  Robin?  You lying sack  of twat.  Oh,  that's not gonna work.  Oh,  boy.  What?  That part didn't make it?  No,  no.  The part of him  sitting in his limo?  Yeah,  that probably made it.  And he refused  to come in  and start the press conference  until we were removed.  Because we were inside? 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  But he doesn't know  about us?  Yeah.  Doesn't know about it.  And everyone's sitting around  looking at their watches  like,  man,  this was supposed  to start at noon.  It's now like 1240.  And then one of our bosses  comes running in  like sweating profusely  and trying to drag us out  so he doesn't get fired.  And we weren't even  going to do anything.  We were just sitting  in the back row  and enjoying a piece  of a freaking hero.  Maybe he was sweating  because he was biting  a pillow minutes before.  And then we actually  walked out of the plaza  and there's the limo  sitting there 
[01:16:30]  with him in it  and he doesn't even  have the balls  to roll down the window  and confront us.  He had to do it  on a phone  with bosses.  That's a cell phone  that I'm bigger than.  Imagine,  you know,  like what Bubba said  that whenever you say  I don't really know them  I haven't heard,  it must kill them.  I've never heard  their show.  I don't know  anything about it.  I don't care.  I've been told  it's reminiscent  of our bits.  Truly,  I listen more  to David Lee Roth  than I've heard.  Oh, Robin. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, did you?  Oh.  You better cook  something up for NASA.  Did you?  Did you listen to that?  Oh, that's terrific.  They all just sit there  and lie to each other  just to make  Howie feel better.  Hope it's working.  Hope your week,  every day of the week  therapy's working.  I hope all your kiss asses  kissing it every day  is working for you.  Hope your half a billion  is working for you.  Whatever.  Have a great time. 
[01:17:30]  Have a party over there.  We're happy for you.  Just keep your lies  to a minimum.  You and Jemima  and the fat load of crap  that just put out  probably could be  one of the worst movies ever  that is going to get confused  with the Broken Lizard movie.  That's going to be funny.  You want to talk about tanking?  We'll take a little look  on Monday there, Artie.  Yeah.  We'll see who really is tanking. 
[01:18:00]  Let's see how much promotion  you could really pump out  on Sirius.  You guys talked about the movie  for over a year over there  or close to a year, right?  We'll see how it does  on Monday.  We'll see.  All right.  I'm done.  I want to talk about  my midlife crisis.  It is pretty funny, actually.  All right.  We got to take a break.  We're really late.  Otto and George,  I saw them in the green room.  I invented puppets.  I did. 
[01:18:30]  Well, you're the puppet master,  aren't you?  Puppet master.  I pull the strings.  Pull the strings.  All right.  It's the only virus  spreading across America.  Go get my limo.  I've got my hurtie.  It's annoying.  That makes me sound  like a really talented comic.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Only creeps listen  to this program.  That's right.  That's a bunch of lies.  Sit down and put on  your laughing hat.  It's time for the  Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:19:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The only virus  spreading across America.  We say hi to Otto  and George.  Good evening.  Otto.  What's happening?  What's up, Otto?  This is the early show, George.  There's no cursing on this one. 
[01:19:30]  That's right.  Yeah.  You can't curse on this one.  No.  That's a shame  because I got like  50 new great cock jokes  that I wanted to try out today.  Attack!  George has to calm down.  Yeah, he might have  to calm down over here.  Otto doing Cleveland  with us on the 23rd of September.  Great.  We got him on another show.  Thanks.  You're in Cleveland right now  and you're listening.  Tickets are on sale.  The other special,  they call it the Jim Norton special.  Of course they do.  It should make you want to vomit. 
[01:20:00]  $10 reserve seat tickets.  There's a limited number  of these special tickets  and get them quick  because when they're gone,  they're gone  according to the redundancy-loving idiot  that is my agent.  Limited number of $10 reserve tickets  are going to go on sale  as of, well, actually, as of now.  This is, good thing they reprinted this  and made it, like, fresh.  This is tomorrow morning.  Wait, that will be Saturday.  No, it's on sale now.  Wait, was that yesterday?  Jesus, can we update these?  Once they're gone, they're gone.  Right now, the tickets are on sale, Cleveland.  So buy them, despite the fact. 
[01:20:30]  I thought perhaps you had a reading problem.  No, I know.  I'm just doing dates  and I'm subtracting from the calendar.  And wait, is it how many  in February this month?  All right.  This month.  Good improv skills.  Cleveland.  It's simple.  Come to the show.  $10 ticket.  $10 tickets for the O&A Traveling Virus.  And it's the last date on the tour.  And we officially added Otto and George  this week.  Thank you.  We're very, very psyched.  I don't want to emphasize down either.  Double cock.  No.  I'm going to dump that out now.  Language, young man.  This is my home.  See, now they know what happens  when you do that, Otto.  They dumped that out, 
[01:21:00]  which means the nice compliment  we just gave you.  Oh.  They didn't hear.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And I'm not going to do  the compliment again.  Unfortunately, they can't just  hit one word at a time.  They just shop.  We need that technology.  Like word recognition.  Yeah, sniper.  And then you load it in  and just that word gets dumped out.  Oh, man.  Oh, I'm inventing that.  Oh, right now.  Oh, really?  I patented that.  No one patents.  By the way, really fast.  Mr. Juan, they're full from Jersey.  You guys are hypocrites.  You talked about how Ron and Fez 
[01:21:30]  were ripping you off,  but now you're pissed.  Now you're pissed that Howard  says the same.  I bet since Ron and Fez  are on your station,  you've told them to knock it off too.  I bet this never makes the air.  Wait a minute.  When did we say Ron and Fez  were ripping us off?  Can I just say something here?  And maybe we'll say it  when we go to the other side also.  The Ron and Fez thing,  was a joke.  I can't believe we were all...  I know.  I can't believe it has to be explained.  We were hoping we would never  have to explain it.  Hey, hey, morons.  We love Ron and Fez. 
[01:22:00]  It's the show I listen to  when I'm driving home.  I love Ron and Fez.  They are funny, nice guys  who have never done anything bad to us.  We've never done anything bad  to their show.  It is nothing but a loving relationship.  It's the only radio show I listen to.  The only one.  We have a blast with those guys.  And we decide out of nowhere  because we just F with each other  all the time.  We started this whole fake battle.  And we couldn't believe  how many people actually bought into it.  It was such an aside. 
[01:22:30]  Somebody called it.  I told you about Ron and Fez.  And I just said,  nah, we don't like those guys anymore.  Yeah.  And we can't talk about it.  People are getting suspended.  And there's human resources involved.  Never meant to be a bit.  Never meant to continue.  People jumped on it.  How would anybody buy that?  But now we have to explain  that it's a bit for this Mr. Wonderful.  And a few other idiots  that actually are like,  you guys won't talk about  your problem with Ron and Fez.  The problem,  we see them in the hall  when we're coming and going  from the station  and just laugh about the whole thing 
[01:23:00]  and how seriously people take it.  It's hysterical.  You're a moron.  It was never intended to be believable.  Didn't it tip anybody off  when somebody called in  and they were saying,  Ron and Fez, what's going on?  And all I said was,  Fez referred to himself as gregarious.  Yeah.  The only answer I would give  is that Fez called himself gregarious.  And then their side,  didn't that tip you off?  Their side,  they were saying that Fez  was sexually harassed  by Opie and Jimmy  and that it was going  through human resources. 
[01:23:30]  And then we each went  on our respective vacations  and each show said  that the other show  was suspended  for doing something  to the other show  during vacation time  that we had announced  that we were taking vacation.  It was so poorly planned out  and put together.  We knew not one idiot  would actually believe it.  But again,  we underestimated the idiots.  A few people have believed it.  And one of them...  How are you feeling now,  Mr. Wonderful?  It was malarkey.  You're an idiot.  Anyway. 
[01:24:00]  These are the same people  that heckle  at a comedy show  like that thing in Philadelphia.  It's just stupid, you know?  They don't get it.  It takes a guy a lifetime  to get to the point  to play a venue like that.  It's probably 100 years  of performing experience  on that show  and they come and heckle  and they don't even listen  to what the guy's saying, you know?  Yeah.  It's really stupid.  Did you see the video  of Bill Burr yet?  It's amazing.  Going after 10,000 people.  It's stuck up for everybody.  And they're commenting  about the video as well.  That one's on YouTube.  Just throw Bill Burr  or Opie and Anthony 
[01:24:30]  into the search.  You'll see it.  It's getting downloaded  like crazy.  It's one of the most viewed  videos of the week  as far as comedy videos go.  It's amazing.  It's just taking off.  And then you read the comments  and people are like,  obviously this was planned.  Obviously he's doing  his material.  It's like, no, he's not.  He threw all that  out the window  and decided to just  attack these people.  Don My Rare is one of the  great comics of our time  and he's from Philadelphia.  Didn't even give him a chance.  No.  What a bunch of jerk offs.  By the way,  the video has been viewed  one version 
[01:25:00]  because with YouTube  you get a million versions  of the same video.  Yeah.  The one version  of the Bill Burr  taking on Philly  has been viewed  over 70,000 times.  Of course.  That is just monster.  I worked with your co-star  Rick Shapiro  Wednesday at Caroline's.  There was some jerk  heckling him there too.  But they took care of him.  I love Rick.  Yeah, his voice was gone  but he was still brilliant.  Really funny.  Yeah, he's a great comic.  Yeah, he's great.  But Bill Burr handled it perfectly  and now it's one for the ages.  It really is.  As far as comedy goes,  it's one for the ages. 
[01:25:30]  The comments are,  I don't know,  hundreds and hundreds  of comments  on the damn thing.  He's a redhead.  Those guys have horrible tempers.  They should have  never antagonized him.  Yeah.  He unloaded.  Redheads are very quick tempered.  Backstage we were saying  it's about time  because we knew  this crap was in his head.  We knew it was in his head.  Yeah.  Actually, it's up to 75,000 times.  Bill Burr was always  portrayed as the nice one,  you know?  Oh, yeah.  The nice boy.  And then he just unloaded.  But he's not done.  He's a nice guy 
[01:26:00]  but he's like repressing  throat-cutting anger.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  Tons of rage in there.  And that came out.  In all comics have rage  but he's got extra rage too.  He left no line uncrossed too  with pounding those people  personally.  That was so funny.  Their families.  Everything.  Rocky's a fictitious character.  Yeah, Joe Frazier's real.  Yeah, that was great.  But because he's black  you don't give him...  How did Don Myrera  take that whole experience?  It just took it  with a grain of salt?  Yeah, he's a pro.  He's a comic.  He's fine with that. 
[01:26:30]  He knows what it is.  Schubert kind of  just went into overdrive.  Did you see Schubert's clip?  No.  They booed Schubert off.  Oh, wow.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wow.  He's a local boy  and they just didn't give him  a chance.  They never gave him a chance.  His whole set was...  The booing was louder  than his material.  That one was uncomfortable.  That was douche chill.  Do you think it would help  the cause if you guys  introduced all the performers  instead of Voss  who's kind of generally  hated by everybody anyway?  Voss actually did very well  and brought the crowd 
[01:27:00]  back a couple of times.  Voss had an unbelievable...  Yeah, he did really good.  Diddy.  Diddy.  Diddy.  It was actually  his best appearance  as far as the only  traveling virus.  Yeah, I remember  you said that on the air.  It really was.  But as a human being  he's hated.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  And they started...  As an intellect.  They started going at him  and he had the best line  that calmed everyone down.  They were kind of like  abusing him  and maybe starting  that booing thing  and he goes,  if you guys don't shut up  I'll bring Jimmy Schubert back  and the place just lost him.  Oh, okay.  And then he had him.  Then he had him  for the rest of the night. 
[01:27:30]  Okay.  He really, really kicked ass.  God.  I would love...  Trust me.  We would love to jump on  and say, yeah, he sucked  and we love beating up Rich  but the reality is  the reality is  he was unbelievable.  You got to be fair.  Yeah, Tracy went on after him.  Tracy Morgan did really well.  Did he?  Yeah, yeah.  Everyone got like  a little bit of crap though.  I feel like they're just animals, man.  Yeah.  But how about you?  You just treated like  an icon, right?  Well, no.  They were good to me.  I went on after Bill  and it was fun.  Jimmy did fine.  Jimmy killed him.  He was unbelievable too.  James, you were there, right? 
[01:28:00]  Yes, sir.  Who did the best?  Oh, Jimmy.  Yeah?  Oh, you don't have to say that  because I'm here, sir.  It's okay.  I know.  It's so embarrassing for everybody.  I know.  It makes us all uncomfortable.  Or at least like  maybe pause like you're thinking about it.  Hmm, well.  Yeah.  You know, I'll give it to Jimmy.  A little acting would be nice.  Yeah, that was really bad.  Who would you say did the best?  Jimmy.  Jimmy, I saw it.  Jimmy.  By far.  I'm looking right at him  so it has to be Jimmy.  I had a crocodile hunt the joke.  Nah, you got to be topical. 
[01:28:30]  What are the odds of being killed by a stingray?  You're more likely to be run over  by a stampede of Jews  going to pick up a check.  Unfunny.  That was a good one.  Unfunny.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Otto, what are we promoting today?  Oh, that thing in Philly.  Comedy.  What is it called?  Oh, the Helium Comedy Club?  No.  Comedy Cabaret.  Well, I gave the competitor.  Oops.  There you go.  We welcome all hecklers.  Oh, what do I know?  I'm just frightened.  The Comedy Cabaret in Philly this weekend?  Yeah, I'm really curious to see  how these radio plugs 
[01:29:00]  draw people there  because I haven't worked  for the Scarpatti in 20 years.  You killed.  Otto didn't do Philly with us  because we had booked in advance  but he did PNC  and you murdered on PNC, man.  Yeah.  Everyone was talking  about your appearance.  The show's going to sell out.  One of the comedy cabarets  are small clubs, man.  So just get tickets.  Don't try to walk up,  you Philly dopes.  Okay.  There will be no seats.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah, Comedy Cabaret  with Otto and George.  We highly recommend you.  Thanks, man.  Check them out.  Which Comedy Cabaret?  There's a few of them.  Do you have a phone number?  You know, Best Western. 
[01:29:30]  I got a phone number somewhere.  Wow, man.  You are the worst  at plugging your own gig.  I know, man.  I know.  We're just trying  to help you out, Otto.  You're just...  I know.  You think maybe the guy  that shot Eric Promotion  can get the number?  You should just have it  tattooed on your palm  at this point.  That guy was a friend of mine.  Rockets Red Glare.  He's in a bunch of movies.  He was in Big...  Rockets Red Glare?  I got his real name.  He was in Tree's Lounge  with Steve Buscemi.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I think he's passed away.  But he used to be a bouncer 
[01:30:00]  at this club called UK Club  on 13th and 3rd.  I used to go in my cocaine days.  But he's the guy  in talk radio  that shot Boghossian.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, with the bad teeth,  the fat...  Yeah.  Not a compliment.  It's not a compliment, Jay.  We're going to take another break.  We've got to catch up  a little bit.  We went way long  with the Howie stuff,  so we're going to take  a quick break.  When we get back,  we almost forgot  the deaf reporter  talking about burn victims.  Oh, man.  There were a couple  of more segments.  And also,  Survivor started last night, 
[01:30:30]  and I saw it, whatever.  Didn't Howard also invent  weather and gravity?  We'd all be floating off  into space.  Thank God for him.  Maybe we can talk  about Survivor  for a few minutes.  The reason I say maybe,  because Jimmy's favorite  columnist had a lot to say  about Survivor.  And who is that?  Linda Stacey.  What do you expect?  Stacey.  What do you expect?  Is it Stacey?  Fat hen.  Everything she says  should be said  over a clothesline.  Stupid.  Some of the jokes she has 
[01:31:00]  is just terrific.  She's an awful writer  for the New York Post  who tries to be relevant  and funny,  and she's neither.  Let me see her  dead hand picture.  She has a picture.  Every stupid columnist  doesn't have their picture.  And hers is a fat,  suburban pig face  tilted with a cadaver hand  propping it up.  It's a white,  dead person's hand  propping her face up.  You're not a comic  in 1982.  I hate her.  Oh, that headshot.  I hate her.  Jimmy can't stand her.  By the way,  for the most part,  most of the columnists  writing about Survivor 
[01:31:30]  that debuted last night  with the whole race thing  were like,  it's no big deal.  But Linda Stacey,  Stacey, whatever,  she thinks it's a big deal.  Of course she does.  We'll get into that  and we'll get into  Karen Meyer,  the deaf reporter,  talking about burn victims next.  It's the ONA virus  spreading across America.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The empire is spreading.  Conquer Earth,  you bastards!  Opie and Anthony!  Hear what everyone else  is talking about.  ONA,

[01:32:30]  11,  this is the worst plug.  Oh my God,  it's right in front of you.  I'll be on stage somewhere in,  uh,  that was the worst plug I've ever,  uh,  it's,  uh,  south of Maine.  It's somewhere in the Northeast.  I'll be somewhere over there.  My mother and father,  they were there.  Over there.  All right,  you're in Northeast Philly.  Northeast Philly.  Okay.

Oh my God.  What?  No one's going to show up in his gig.  He's doing a Pennsylvania gig the night before us as well.  All right.  Oh.  Wipe your slates clean.  Yeah,  let's start over.  Let's start over.  I'll plug it tonight's show.  Tonight,  which is,  what's the date?  September 16th.  Oh my God.  Okay.  Wipe again.  Right.  Wait,  wait,  wait.

Otto and George will be appearing at the comedy cabaret in Northeast Philadelphia.  Uh,  here's the phone number.  Oh,  this should be easy to remember too.  215-676-JOKE.  Uh,  that's right,  folks.  215-676-JOKE.  Not as bad as,  ah, 
[01:34:00]  ah,  it's joke.  Vinny,  Vinny should be decapitated like a contractor for that one.  215-676-JOKE tonight,  Northeast Philly Comedy Cabaret and tomorrow night.  At the Best Western.  Yes.  Okay.  And it will sell out.  It's a small club,  so get tickets.  Yeah,  it's a good show.  And Johnny O's on the bill too.  I give a shout out to my friend Johnny O.  You got two shows or one tonight?  One a night.  It's a cinch.  It's a cinch.  Johnny O will throw punches.  Oh, 
[01:34:30]  and,  uh,  Anthony's got something too.  Yes,  we have to remind people that,  um,  uh,  we have a MacBook.  A little MacBook giveaway.  Five of them we got.  Jiminy Cricket.

Go to frontgaytickets.com,  my one show in upstate New York this year.  All right.  15 bucks,  you chislers.  Um,  chislers?  Mr.  1940? 
[01:35:30]  $5 for students.  Meh.  So pretend you're a student.  I lost my books.  Come on,  buy a ticket,  you lousy screw.  Yeah.  Hand me that rock.  Buy a ticket,  pinch penny.  Remember,  no heat is allowed in the auditorium.  All right,  listen,  Survivors started last night,  the new season,  Cook Islands.  And,  and,  and there was a lot of,  uh,  talk about this season because they did,  they decided to divide the teams and,  and,  and,  and race into race just like real life.  Yeah.  They have a black team.  They got a Hispanic team. 
[01:36:00]  They got an Asian team and they got a,  uh,  a white American team,  I guess.  Whitey.  And just whitey in general.  Yeah.  And,  uh,  man,  John Lou was up in arms and all these people.  Harumph,  harumph.  And,  uh,  you know,  it,  it,  it created a great buzz for Survivor.  Yeah,  it really did.  It kind of brought it back again.  And now the show was on last night and now people are writing about it.  And pretty much most people are saying,  what was the big deal?  Uh,  let's see.  I don't know what the name of this guy's column.  I'm,  I want to give him credit, 
[01:36:30]  but he says the controversial Cook Island's edition of Survivor began last night and the veteran CBS reality series established quickly that any change of racism were unfounded.  Any charges of racism were unfounded.  Sorry.  Dividing tribes along ethnic lines was just another way to keep the game fresh,  introduce a new variant and get attention.  All of which worked.  Uh,  racist,  it sure didn't seem like it to me.  This writer is saying.  What happened?  Nothing.  I'm looking at Iraq.  Why?  Why would you?  Because he's playing with the video camera. 
[01:37:00]  Oh,  he's bored today.  So I just typed,  knock it off Iraq into the text.  I don't think he could read,  but that's the Paltalk camera.  You'll learn about that soon,  Fort Michigan.  The guy is silent.  Uh,  there wasn't any taunting of one tribe to another and the only ethnic humor was uttered and enjoyed by tribe members in their own surroundings.  And even if there was ethnic humor uttered,  who cares?  They showed,  uh,  it was okay if the Asians made fun of themselves.  Well,  they showed a preview of next week and one of the Asian guys is doing Asian jokes.  Oh,  ha ha. 
[01:37:30]  Must be good ones.  Yeah.  Because they're all so funny.  Where's the outrage?  They're doing it because you can't because they're Asian.  Are they,  are they as funny as that fan?  Well,  no.  Well,  no one says funny as that fan.  Come on.  Uh,  buh,  buh,  buh,  buh.  And,  you know,  so basically he's like,  what's the big deal?  Okay.  Linda.  Stacey or Stacey?  Stacey.  I just pronounce it pig.  This ugly slob who writes for the New York Post and she's a cornball. 
[01:38:00]  They should take language,  young man.  I don't mean to be so fresh.  Wow.  She's trying to be funny and interesting and it's like,  you're not.  For her first line,  she should have her typewriter taken away.  Cause you know,  she still does her column on it.  Oh yeah.  I ain't changing.  I'm not changing.  This is how I started in the business.  That's why she's got that dead white hand from slapping the carriage back.  Putting white out over anything that might've been funny in her column. 
[01:38:30]  I laughed so hard.  I had to buckle myself out of my couch.  Did you pig?  Did you really?  Why do these columnists insist on trying to be funny?  If you're a funny person and you can get away with it,  great.  But they all try to throw that little funny line in and it bombs horribly.  This is why I'd like to blow anthrax in her fat face.  Listen to this opening line from Linda Stacey.  She doesn't like the new survivor.  Let's rate this.  The subheading is TV ought to be ashamed of itself.  Again.  It certainly should lend a good point. 
[01:39:00]  And this is Fatso's first line.  I'm mad as hell.  And I'm not going to take it anymore.  Hey, she's original too.  She certainly is.  And for once, I'm actually in a position to do something about it.  What is that you're in a position to do something about?  What position is she in to do anything about it?  The dead body hand propping up your mullet face and your stupid headshot?  She has a mullet.  Oh, dude, you're reading the wrong Linda Stacey column.  They gave her two.  As they should have, Opie. 
[01:39:30]  Go to the other side.  But I like how she's not going to take it anymore.  Where?  Opie, where?  Because that is, she's talking about the Nancy Grace suicide scandal and the Nicole Smith thing.  Which we can get into, no problem.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Here, here, here.  Here it is.  Oh, I got scared.  They gave her two stories?  No, no, they gave her one.  She got two columnans.  Two columnans.  Columans.  One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one.  Um, she said, uh, oh, here's, okay, you're right. 
[01:40:00]  Uh, she gave it two stars.  Yeah.  Uh, she said, maybe we should just call it Amazing Race-ist.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I think this is another show called Amazing Race and this should be calling me.  I didn't see it coming.  I, I.  Oh, that hyphen is a hoot.  Hey, what about the headline?  Uh.  Uh.  I don't know what it means.  A dis, D-I-S-S, and under it, G, and then in parentheses, race. 
[01:40:30]  How much wordplay can you do?  A dis.  A disgrace.  A disgrace.  Grace.  It's a disgrace.  Dis.  Grace.  Grace.  Oh, that is such a reach.  Oh, she's such a hack.  Maybe we should just call it Amazing Race-ist.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  All right.  Yeah, she's clever.  But let's get to more.  I can't wait to be invited to your cocktail.  Let's hear her pale white guilt.  Yeah, of course it is.  Let's hear it.  I'm talking about last night's newest much-hyped season of Survivor,  in which the teams are divided by ethnicity, or as host, Jeff Probst. 
[01:41:00]  I hate his name.  If you have a B, an S, and a T, and a row in your name, change it, Jeff.  Jeff Probst.  What a douchey sound like.  Who's this?  Jeff Probst is calling.  Probst.  With a soft T, Probst.  You can't put, like, a B and a T together.  Why would you?  No one does.  Or an S, or a Probst.  Describes them.  Asian Americans, Latinos, African Americans, and Caucasians. 
[01:41:30]  How come all these thumbelists are Americans?  Why is it if you're Asian, you're an American?  If you're African, you're an American?  But if you're white, you're just a good deed dealer.  Just a spread of sunshine.  Conspicuously missing are American Americans, a.k.a. Native Americans.  Conspicuously?  Oh, God.  What?  They're all drunk somewhere.  Yeah, exactly.  Couldn't find any of them that were sober.  That's right.  They're either alcoholics or iron workers or both.  Not to mention that old Survivor Standby, bartending Americans.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, my God.  I hope he just fell out of his chair.  Oh, women are funny.  Knocked over the garbage.  Oh, women are funny.  Uh-oh.  Go get the interns.  Did you spill?  Who cares?  Let them pick it up and don't get the white ones.  I couldn't help myself if it was so funny.  I'm picking up everyone else's breakfast.  Let it go.  Let them do it.  Egg, coffee, fruit. 
[01:42:30]  While he's picking that up, I've got to read something from Steve from Bayshore,  who is actually just quoting the brilliant Ron Bennington from Ron and Fez's show.  They were talking about this.  And he said, the blacks will be good at sports.  The Hispanics will be good at gardening.  The Asians will be good at math.  And the whites will land on the moon.  Ron Bennington from the Ron and Fez show.  I've got to tell you, I was watching last night,  and it just gives you permission to make racist jokes as you're watching them. 
[01:43:00]  Of course.  It's a lot of fun.  Because their first challenge, the teams, they had to put together some kind of boat  so they could paddle out to get like a torch or whatever it was.  So what are the jokes?  Of course.  Well, the black team didn't get their boat together right away.  And I'm saying, well, that's because they're scared.  If the boat doesn't work, they're going to fall in the water,  and they're not going to be able to swim back to shore.  Either that or they built a boat where they just lay on the bottom of it, head to foot. 
[01:43:30]  That's the fun of the game, though.  And the cruise takes three months.  Right.  But they're sitting in the water.  Okay.  They're sitting in the water up to their waist,  and they're taking their time putting the boat together because they're like,  they don't want to risk it and paddle out there over their heads.  I'm telling you, this is going to be the greatest survivor ever.  The Asian team builds a big junk that is later boarded by a PT boat, and everyone is shot. 
[01:44:00]  All right.  Getting back to Linda.  Young captain.  This is what I love about her is the fact that she would criticize something for being racially charged,  and you write for the New York Post.  The drivel this newspaper pushes us with Fat Nick from Brooklyn.  Your paper is racially obsessed, just like that stupid John Liu.  Yeah.  He's Asian, and that's all he sees himself as.  That's all he views himself as, and it's okay for them to identify themselves and use race, 
[01:44:30]  but as soon as a TV show does it, that's exploitation.  I just can't stand her.  I really don't want to read the whole column.  Very separatist.  She's an unfunny cornball.  You want to read it?  I hate her.  I hate her.  She's a dead body hand.  None of it was highlighted.  I don't know what's interesting.  Dead body hand.  Nothing.  It's her article.  I don't know.  After bartending Americans, do you understand why women are not particularly funny?  It's just a TV show.  She writes, problem is what these strangers do, whether they like it or not, 
[01:45:00]  reflect on their whole ethnic group on a national scale.  Why?  Why?  Why does that affect your ethnic team?  Why?  I don't get it.  I don't either.  How does that reflect on other ethnicities?  Typical, stupid, white.  The Asian tribe, including Harapar, Harapar, Harapar, Harapar, Harapar, Harapar, Harapar,  Harapar, Harapar, Harapar.  Are you kidding me?  Was, uh, I couldn't attempt to pronounce that name. 
[01:45:30]  Was very conscious about the possibility of racial stereotyping, yet the members fell  right into the typical Asian stereotype by swiftly figuring out two intricate giant puzzles.  Those Asians, are they smart or what?  Let me tell you what the intricate puzzle was.  What?  You had to, like, make the letter N, and the letter S, and the letter W, and the letter E.  With various puzzle pieces?  Yeah.  I'll take two Gs for a thousand?  Yeah.  Was there anything in the puzzle solving that involved a small mule? 
[01:46:00]  By the way, problem is what these strangers do, whether or not they like it,  reflects on the whole ethnic group on a national scale.  Why don't you write something like that about a gang?  Stupid.  Let's see how much balls you have.  Why don't you write something like that about a black gang and how that reflects on blacks as blacks?  I would love to see you have the moral courage to write that.  Well, Jimmy, speaking of the blacks, the shwoogies, if you will,  the African-Americans also fell into a typical racist stereotype, 
[01:46:30]  but a much more demeaning one, when they had the worst time trying to put together the puzzles.  Rednecks all over will be screaming with joy.  Now, what?  What?  I don't understand this.  Why is rednecks okay?  God, Linda.  Why is that okay to lump all white people with rednecks?  It's okay to say redneck?  Linda Stassi has some of that white guilt.  Of course she does.  That Jimmy taught us all about.  Some of it.  That white guilt.  She's better than black people, so she needs to talk to them like they're children  because they're not equals and they don't understand what she's saying. 
[01:47:00]  Did they have trouble with the puzzle?  I don't know.  Then what's the problem?  Probably.  Why comment on it that that's a stereotype?  Her commenting that the black team not being able to solve a puzzle is a racial stereotype.  That's racism right there.  Instead of realizing that maybe there's six dopes who couldn't do a puzzle.  Maybe there's just, yeah, maybe they're just stupid people.  Maybe they're just stupid human beings that can't put a frigging puzzle together.  The team that loses and all of a sudden she thinks it's an issue of melanin. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  What, we got a call on the line that doesn't agree?  Jason in Georgia has something, yes.  All right.  Jason?  I'm sure it'll be good.  How about it?  How y'all?  There you go.  Hey, Mike.  Quick question for you.  What do you think about the white people just maybe hiring the mace contrived to build  their homes?  You're not from around here, are you, boy?  Stupid accent.  You wanted to say, but it's taken...  The Waffle House.  This is the first phone call of the day, by the way. 
[01:48:00]  And what Jason wanted to say was, did the Mexican team build the whites camp?  They're Latino.  We get it.  There's Caucasian, Latino, and then Asian American, African American.  Latino.  Right.  Well, it goes on.  Mark Burnett, the British-born creator of Survivor, clearly has such disdain for this  country, which made him incredibly rich, that he said the reason he created a race-based  season is because America has a history of bad things happening to certain races, and that  he grew up where such things never happened.  Where? 
[01:48:30]  And then...  Genius.  And then she writes, right.  Right.  Well, technically, maybe Mark Burnett has a point, because there was a bunch of people  who left England to get freedom and then took slaves.  Right.  I'm not saying it didn't happen over there.  I don't know if it did or not.  History is for fags.  Well.  They kind of...  Very good.  I don't know where it happened.  History is for fags.  All right.  I learned that today.  About their English colonization. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  All that.  Oh, they're naughty.  Enslaving the people in...  Well, history is for fags.  No, no.  I can't defend Mark Burnett.  You're right.  I just pray they have a spear-throwing contest.  Oh, me too.  Oh, wow.  I just pray they go the distance.  Who can de-tooth this lion the fastest and make a necklace out of it?  Please, Mark Burnett.  Please.  We've got various size plates.  Right.  We're going to see who can get the biggest ones in your lower lip.  Go.  Yeah.  Meantime, people in other countries who are all of one race fight for thousands of years 
[01:49:30]  over religious differences.  While we diverse Americans get along pretty darn well.  Yeah, we certainly do.  L.A. riots.  Good point.  This idiot doesn't even see that we are this close to a race war.  She's a dummy.  Yeah.  She's a dummy.  She thinks her article is going to change human nature.  It is hatred in man.  You know, it's just... 
[01:50:00]  It's just the way we are.  Yeah.  But she's such a coward that she would write that their behavior is indicative of their  race and because they couldn't solve the puzzles because they're black...  Because they're black.  She said it.  Well, she's saying that that's what Survivor is doing.  Yeah.  But she won't even point at her own disgusting newspaper.  Her thinking is all effed up.  Yeah.  She's a silly goose.  Pardon my French.  I'm going to open a hole like this.  Let's go to Marion.  Marion?  Yes.  Hey.  The Vietnamese guy on Survivor?  Yeah.  His name is Cowboy. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Even though it's spelled...  Yeah.  It's spelled C-A-O-B-O-I.  All right.  Cowboy.  Oh.  Cowboy it is then.  Thanks for correcting me.  Cowboy.  Skewing Survivor so that it appears like we're a country divided along racist ethnic lines  is just plain wrong.  Ew.  Why?  What are you...  Are you nuts?  Are you nuts?  That's how this whole country works.  But we are all divided on racial lines.  You ever been to a place called Chinatown?  Yeah.  It's full of Chinese people.  Little Italy? 
[01:51:00]  Little Italy?  Little Italy?  You ever been uptown Harlem?  Absolutely not.  You ever see the Puerto Rican Day Parade?  No.  The Irish Day Parade?  Yeah.  You ever see...  All we have is ethnic parades.  All we have in this stupid city.  We have Black History Month.  All we have is ethnic pride.  Yeah.  We're obsessed with ethnicity.  We can't drive around Manhattan on the weekends because there's a parade every single weekend.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Is she a naive, dead-handed...  The whole country is very divided along racial lines.  Here's how you know she stinks on every level. 
[01:51:30]  While we diverse Americans get along, and she wrote pretty darned well.  Yes.  Who talks like that?  I would love to put a microphone in her car when she's driving home, in her house when  she's watching the news, because I bet she talks just like I do.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, that nigger cut me off.  Oh, yeah.  You're right.  Wouldn't you love to hear Linda Stassi just drop the N-bomb as she's being cut off? 
[01:52:00]  Or talk about how Asians can't drive, or just something.  Just the fact that this dummy thinks that we're not divided along racial lines.  I don't know.  Does anybody remember the OJ verdict?  Mm-hmm.  It was almost a 99-to-1 reaction on each side.  Yeah.  Whites were appalled.  Blacks were happy.  If that doesn't tell you that we're divided...  What did you think that was divided?  By height or sock thickness?  Yeah.  You dumb bitch.  You dumb bitch.  All right.  Well...  Oh, my God.  Why does she suck? 
[01:52:30]  So, I'll say it again here.  Skewing survivors so that it appears like we're a country divided along racist ethnic lines  is just plain wrong.  Interesting that Burnett claims to have grown up in a place without bigotry, and yet he's  created a show based on that very concept.  On bigotry.  Why is it bigotry?  Why?  You see it as bigotry.  Why can't you just see it as people competing?  Linda Stassi from the New York Post is just an irrelevant, ugly woman with a mullet.  Oh, that's a little harsh. 
[01:53:00]  Is that all she does is write about television?  That's all she does?  She's a TV critic.  Yeah.  TV critic.  Jesus.  And she's got that soccer mom point of view.  That's right.  She does.  Let me tell you, when I play mahjong with my friends, they're of all ethnicities.  Yeah, I'm sure they are.  They're white, white, and whiter.  Yeah.  I'm sure when you're having tea together, it's all diverse, right?  I'm sure black people are coming over. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, yeah.  The Stassi residents.  Or is it that the black people, well, probably the black people are, you know, pushing your  baby carriage.  Yeah, there you go.  The Hispanics are out doing your lawn.  Yeah.  And the Asians, what are they doing?  Probably serving the tea.  Doing the laundry.  Doing the laundry.  They're doing the laundry.  So, yeah, she's got diversity in her life.  A lot of diversity in her house.  Yeah, I'm sure she does.  Stop it.  Hypocrite.  Liar, liar.  You're a liar.  Pants on fire.  Liar, liar. 
[01:54:00]  I like to say.  All right, listen.  Deaf reporter.  Mom, bunt pants on fire.  Deaf reporter from yesterday.  What?  What?  And your midlife crisis.  What?  Your midlife crisis thing.  What's that?  We got an update on Anthony's car that he wants.  We'll do that next.  It's not a midlife crisis.  I have to defend myself.  All right, you can do that.  Otto and George in studio playing somewhere in northeast Philly.  That's all we got out of him so far.  Tonight, tomorrow night, Comedy Cabaret in northeast Philly.  It's in a Best Western, and I'll be in upstate New York. 
[01:54:30]  It's SUNY Del High, and we're all going to have a lot of laughs.  Thanks, James.  I love your sock joke.  Woo-hoo, me too.  Very funny.  Sock in thickness.  I got it out without tripping on it.  LOL.  That was good.  And I will be buying drinks at FH Riley's all weekend long.  All weekend?  400 New York Avenue in Huntington, my brother's restaurant.  In Huntington Village.  Drink blowout from Opie.  Can please a bunch of listeners show up?  If you understood how newsworthy what you just heard is, please, I want a thousand listeners  to show up at FH Riley's.  Why? 
[01:55:00]  When you only need three from Whack Bag?  You know those drunks.  I'm going to try to invite some of my friends to have a little dinner there.  Yeah?  See how the joint's doing.  Yeah.  What am I doing Friday?  Come on.  Friday night?  Where is it open?  Tonight?  Huntington Village.  Tonight I might be at another restaurant with my mom in Greenland.  Okay.  And then I'll go to FH Riley's, my bro's restaurant, for drinks later tonight.  And then I think I might eat there tomorrow night.  Because I really just want to get drunk off my ass and drive my new car. 
[01:55:30]  All right.  We'll talk about that next.  How's that?  Okay.  All right.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  O.B. Anthony Dance Party Weekend.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Comedy gone too far.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi, everybody.  Are you having a good radio show? 
[01:56:00]  Thanks for cutting my strawberries today, by the way, Kenny.  Greatly appreciated.  Sorry, Jimmy.  Figured I threw myself under the bus.  Just getting ready for my little bowl of cereal.  And the blueberries.  We're at the end of blueberry season.  So Kenny decided to take it upon himself to bring in another choice.  And it was strawberries.  And then he asked me if I wanted them cut.  If he acknowledges that he actually cut the strawberries of another man, I'll never make eye contact with him again. 
[01:56:30]  There's a picture of Kenny holding an umbrella as I walk down the sidewalk from yesterday's walkover on O.B. and Anthony.com.  Aren't those the worst pictures?  It looks ridiculous.  He probably cut them the same way they cut the garlic in Goodfellas.  Just gentle slices.  We're perfect for cereal.  Don't bother me.  I'm measuring thickness.  Yeah, you know it has to be a perfect slice.  Of course it does.  Each one just so. 
[01:57:00]  All right.  There's a picture of Kenny holding an umbrella for me yesterday.  It looks like a Hummel.  Oh, my God.  It does look like a Hummel.  They're like figurines.  The boss and dummy.  That's the one that was called.  God, it makes me look like I'm a midget.  Kenny's a big boy.  And by the way, Anthony, someone held an umbrella for you yesterday as well.  That's right.  And Jimmy, someone held one for you as well.  Someone held a diaphragm for me.  It didn't keep me dry.  I'm a little fella.  And it didn't keep me dry. 
[01:57:30]  That umbrella stunk.  You had one of those little clown umbrellas.  It looks like Gene Kelly walking hand in hand with the Chrysler building.  Bad blazer on.  Very good, Otto.  All right.  A couple things.  We got to do the football picks.  Football picks?  We got $10,000 up for grabs.  Thanks to Dish Network.  Call 1-888-1-888-GET-DISH.  1-888-GET-DISH. 
[01:58:00]  The football picks are sponsored by Dish Network.  More football for you.  Better TV for all.  Okay?  We're going to do that before we get out of here.  And whoever has the best record at the end of the season will win the $10,000.  Now, what's going on?  It's the guys behind the scenes that are doing the football picks, and I'm doing them as well along with the guys, but I'm just, like, picking my teams out of a hat and stuff.  And the first week I did pretty well.  What did I do?  Two out of five?  Two, I think.  And that's good? 
[01:58:30]  Well, because I'm not trying.  That's the whole thing.  That's the bit.  I'm not trying, and I'm not in last place, by the way.  Why are you not trying, by the way?  Because they work hard.  They don't make me funny.  No, no, you're assuming if you tried, you'd just beat everybody.  Oh, yeah, that's a good point.  You're being very, like, presumptuous.  No, you're right.  You've got to call me out on that.  You're right.  He's saying he won't use his gifts.  Right, exactly.  I have a gift when it comes to picking games.  You're right.  Do you?  No.  I think it's actually the other way. 
[01:59:00]  I have the sports curse.  Yeah, but I think you have a better chance.  I think this is better.  Just picking them at random than you do if you would pick them with any logic.  It's hacky radio, to be honest with you.  Like, just imagine if I actually win the whole season by just doing it, you know, picking the games in stupid ways.  Then I win the $10,000, and I want to throw it from a helicopter from one of the cities we've been broadcasting.  Helicopter.  They're chasing me, Robin.  So I really do.  I want to take $10,000 if I win this.  Thanks to Dish Network. 
[01:59:30]  More football for you.  Better TV for all.  1-888-GET-DISH.  And I want to throw my $10,000 out from a helicopter over one of the cities we broadcast.  But you're saying I should really try.  I'm just, no, I'm not saying you should or shouldn't.  I was just saying that you're being very presumptuous by saying, like, I'm throwing the guys a bone by not picking them.  Like, you're, you know, the greatest sports pick guy ever.  The faithful listeners know about my sports curse. 
[02:00:00]  So you would.  Every team I pick loses.  So you would pick a team and then go the opposite and absolutely win.  So I figure I have better odds of getting some winners here if I'm just doing it in dumb ways.  Like, today I want Otto to, oh, we got some whack job.  I hope that's not one of ours.  Oh, I certainly hope it is.  Oh, wow, what a whack.  Oh, he turned around.  Is it a bit?  He turned around.  He's yelling at the guy.  Are they doing a bit?  Oh, is it a bit?  It's funny, too.  Yeah, it's a bit.  Oh, yeah, he just pointed.  What?  Wow.  Oh, it's that hacky. 
[02:00:30]  But he has, like, a really long, thin head.  This guy's very funny.  Oh, that's it.  We ought to bring back the assault on the media just for this guy.  Just for this guy.  Oh, the guy in the lab.  To show him what it's really like.  Was that a bit?  It had to be.  Of course it is.  You know how fast they would have muscles?  Oh, my God.  Of course it's a bit.  That's my friend.  Who?  Who?  The guy that was just jumping up and down.  He's a cameraman for Fox 5.  That's your friend?  Yeah, he's a good guy.  Tell your friend he stinks on camera.  He's a good guy.  He may be a terrific guy.  But on camera, he doesn't make love to it. 
[02:01:00]  He's a really good guy, actually.  Thank you.  All right.  So that was it.  What time does your wife get home?  I'll be at your Jiminy other joint.  All right.  What am I going to do here?  Oh, you want to talk about your midlife crisis?  Well, they're calling it a midlife crisis.  People are saying.  People are saying.  Message boards are saying.  I just see it as, you know, they always call certain things a midlife crisis when you just 
[02:01:30]  weren't able to do those things weren't able to do those things in your 20s for, you know,  financial reasons, perhaps.  I purchased a motor vehicle yesterday.  I wanted a car.  Yeah.  I've been driving SUVs for a long time.  I'm still keeping my SUV because I wanted a fun car.  And, you know, it's not a car you drive in the snow or lousy weather or anything like that.  Or an ice.  Or an ice.  Something like that. 
[02:02:00]  So I decided I want to buy a car.  And what am I going to do?  Go out and buy, you know, a Taurus?  Attaboy.  I don't want to buy a Taurus.  I don't want to buy a Saturn.  I don't want to buy, you know, I want to buy something that's got, that's, you know, fun.  It's just there for fun.  It's not a car you commute in.  It's not a car you, you know, drive a lot.  So I bought a 2007 Shelby GT500. 
[02:02:30]  You could, dude, you could zip right to the Hamptons, isn't it?  No, no, no.  I don't go to the Hamptons.  I do not go to the Hamptons.  It's a nice car, man.  This is just a car to have some fun with.  But apparently a few people think it's a midlife crisis.  But I see midlife crisis as you're in a point in your life where you're not happy with where you are. 
[02:03:00]  Maybe you're, you know, you're married, you got kids, you feel like, you know, your best years are behind you.  And you're doing something to, you know, get over a crisis.  I'm having a pisser.  I'm having a field day over here.  And, you know, this lifestyle has afforded us the opportunity to purchase some toys like that.  You show none of the signs of midlife crisis, to be very honest with you.  Normally that's like to say, like, you know, a guy who played, like, a lot of video games, have a much younger girlfriend, drive a sports car. 
[02:03:30]  Okay, look, I've done that forever.  Look, I was dating a 13-year-old at 19.  Atta boy, Jerry Lee.  I also was playing video games.  I played Star Raiders on an Atari 800.  I soiled diapers.  I got over it.  So I...  You never win.  It's actually a really nice car.  And I'm sure Philip Seymour Hoffman would like to show Mark Wahlberg. 
[02:04:00]  You want to kiss me?  You want to kiss me on the mouth?  You like the color?  Oh, yeah.  I painted it like yours.  I, uh, yeah, so I went out.  These are very hard to find, by the way.  I like your name a lot.  The best scene when he's holding that boom mic and he can't control his breathing and he's shaking. 
[02:04:30]  Dirk Diggler, what a great movie.  Dirk Diggler.  You got the touch.  You got the power.  Oh, man.  One minute.  One minute left in the period.  Nice part.  Thank you, Bill Burr.  Yeah, so, uh, you know, these things are pretty hard to find.  And, uh, somebody on PalTalk yesterday, uh, told me of a dealership that, uh, had a few of these.  You get down there, they're all gone.  These guys have one left and it was because some poor guy going through a midlife crisis, I guess, uh, couldn't, uh, swing the money for some reason. 
[02:05:00]  So it was all prepped, ready to go.  And, uh, I took it.  That's it.  It looks like it might have a loud engine, like, like, really, like, loud when you rev it up or anything.  It purrs.  It purrs?  It hums.  It does?  It's, uh, supercharged.  It's, it's 500 horsepower.  Wow.  So it's, it's a monster.  And I know that a lot of people have already heard, dude, you should have gotten a vet. 
[02:05:30]  The vet gets, and then they throw a bunch of stats at you, like, I'm going to be at the track on the weekends with this thing.  No.  I won't, believe me, I will not even attain the potential of this vehicle.  Yeah.  Uh, it's not like I need, you know, an extra, uh, quarter of a second taking off my, uh, quarter mile time.  Yeah.  Don't worry about it.  I'm going to have fun with this.  It's a fun driving vehicle.  And, uh, that's what it is.  But I'll tell you how nerve wracking it is to drive a new car like that home.  And it's a shift.  It doesn't, it doesn't come in an automatic.  Six speed manual. 
[02:06:00]  You got a shift.  Nice car.  And, uh, man, anyone gets next to you?  You need that.  Oh, thanks.  What do you get?  Oh, oh, you just were handed something nice.  What is that?  Keys to a police car.  That's pretty much what I'm going to need.  That's a key.  That's pretty much what he just gave me.  All I see is going about a quarter mile every time I get pulled over.  It's just going to be ridiculous.  But midlife crisis, um, I don't know. 
[02:06:30]  I would say no.  No, midlife crisis just means you can finally afford stuff.  Yeah.  Like, why is it considered that?  If I could afford something nice when I was 25, I'd have done that too.  You would have got this at 20, 22 years old.  No problem.  It does depend on what someone's doing with their motors.  Like, when older guys, when a guy's 50 and he gets, like, a long earring and grows a rat tail and gets something that's considered.  That's a midlife crisis.  That's a midlife crisis.  But just, uh, buying something you finally can afford.  I don't know.  What you just did, I hated because the faster you go, the more danger you are of hitting. 
[02:07:00]  Something.  Which, listen here, uh, paycheck.  No.  Why don't you stop?  I want you to, like, all helmeted up in little scooters doing eight miles an hour.  Yeah.  I still commute in my big beast.  I want you to live across the street and go home in a rickshaw.  We're just getting into this.  We'll have to talk about this more on Monday, Anthony.  First half of the Opie and Anthony show is over.  Uh, we're heading over to XM.  If you're not joining us, thanks so much for, uh, checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:07:30]  Absolutely.  By the way, I'm going to just show you how powerful I am when it comes to picking games.  Oh.  I studied it, and these are my picks.  I did not, uh, pick them out of a hat.  I'm just proving you this is how great I am.  Yes.  Okay?  All right.  And then we'll go back to picking them out of a hat next week because I'm going to do  really well now.  I could.  I could.  Because I looked at all the games.  I take the Lions over the Bears.  I take the Giants over the Eagles.  Sorry, Philly.  I take the Redskins over Jimmy's Cowboys.  No!  I take the 49ers over the Rams.  Ooh.  And, of course, Steelers over, uh, the Jaguars. 
[02:08:00]  Those are my picks this week.  Watch how well I do.  That's right.  Take the mirror image of that.  And you're in good shape.  Oh, and I got to thank, it was McCarville Ford out in Centery that actually had it.  Thank you, McCarville Ford.  Oh, we're not going to leave that alone.  We're going to get into this.  Oh, yeah.  Big time on Monday.  Going to ride.  Yes.  We'll do a whole thing on midlife crisis stuff.  Otto, thank you so much.  Somewhere in North America.  Northeast Philly.  Northwestern.  Comedy Cabaret.  Comedy Cabaret.  We highly recommend if you're in the area to stop by and check out Otto and George. 
[02:08:30]  They're great.  Thank you, my brother.  And they're on the Cleveland ONA Traveling Virus.  Tickets for now, $10 for that.  $10.  That's going to be great.  And we're a ticket master.  I'll be at SUNY Del High tomorrow night.  And next weekend, I'm finally coming to Pittsburgh.  Yeah.  Is that next weekend?  No, we'll be in Cleveland.  I don't know.  Just shut up.  I ruined it.  The end of the month, Jimmy.  End of the month.  All right.  Have a great weekend.  The O.P. and Anthony XM walkover begins now. 
[02:09:00]  I think his countdown stunk today, too, because I heard the music start and you were still  counting.  Yeah.  Like, I knew we were already on the air.  Hi, everybody.  It's the walkover.  We've got a couple of people out here from South Carolina. 
[02:09:30]  Yes.  Yeah?  Welcome.  What brings you to New York, sir?  Well, we got $9 plane tickets to Boston and we rented a car and drove.  $9 plane tickets?  $9.  What is that?  They pulled my wing on.  Spirit Air.  Oh, of course.  Oh, Spirit Air.  There you go.  I had to keep my legs up.  It was awful.  Are you serious, right?  It was $9.  Keep your legs up where?  Like, in stirrups, almost.  It was that close together.  It was awful.  Yeah.  Wow.  $9. 
[02:10:00]  They should tie your cock to the fucking tail and just drag you.  I had to sit on my bag.  It was...  I was talking high-pitched all last night.  Were there chickens running around the cabin?  Like an Indiana Jones flight.  And, uh...  Love little Jimmy.  ONA passed South.  Because we didn't want to ask you to ask us which way was North.  So we put South.  Ah, all the jokes.  They got all the jokes. 
[02:10:30]  I like it, though, man.  And we got a couple from, uh...  Where?  Philly?  Where are you from?  From Philly.  They're here to see Stephen Lynch in The Wedding Singer.  Oh, very cool.  Oh, enjoy.  And, uh...  Yeah.  Nothing...  Nothing says mug me like, uh...  Two people that look exactly like you lugging luggage around.  I think those piercings are gonna, like, scare some off.  Yeah.  Some.  Like who?  Not which way is North.  Yo, man. 
[02:11:00]  Uh...  You know which way...  No, we're not from here.  And, bam, right in the head.  Yeah.  Blindsided.  Francina's here, and she's carrying a hat.  A hat box.  And she's got an oldie-time, like, Lucille Ball hat box.  What is that?  It's pajamas from Eric.  Sasquahanna Hat Company.  Wait.  Pajamas from...  No, not pajamas.  What'd you say?  Eric E-Rock.  What are they?  Pajamas.  No, she said...  Pajamas.  Pajamas.  Pajamas?  What are they?  Pajamas.  Pajamas.  Pajamas?  Pajamas.  Really?  Why did E-Rock get you pajamas? 
[02:11:30]  I don't know, but I like it.  Wow, he is a creep.  What is he trying to do?  Where is E-Rock?  Hey, E-Rock.  Is that his normal production move?  He buys them sleepwear?  Are you trying to fuck her?  Where is he?  Be real here.  Where is he?  Talking to Tom.  Talking to Tom about nonsense.  Tom is a busy man.  Yeah.  Like he needs the likes of E-Rock talking to him.  Where is that fucking E-Rock?  Ew.  Is he way over there?  And Tom, then there was this guy, and then what happened, and then...  All right, shut up. 
[02:12:00]  E-Rock!  I'm the boss, you idiot.  And I've always had hair cut like a child.  You've got to love this echo.  E-Rock!  Wow.  They're leopard print.  They're leopard print pajamas.  They're very sexy.  Are they like...  Is it like a lingerie type pajamas?  It is lingerie.  Are you going to put them on?  Sure.  Oh, I'm going to whack my bag.  Wow.  You're going to put them on?  Yeah.  In the studio?  Yeah.  I'm going to fill up.  Wow.  She'll have those on when she reads the transcript. 
[02:12:30]  We're doing the transcript.  That's good.  All right.  E-Rock should then be praised.  He's too dumb to think that far in advance.  Yeah.  Whose idea was it?  Yeah.  What's going on with you and E-Rock?  Nothing.  He just gave them to me when I came in.  Is there a card in there?  No.  I see a piece of paper on the bottom.  No?  It's not a card?  I wish it was a love letter.  Oh, man.  Who's Otto?  He had to go somewhere.  He's not going to join us for the second half today.  He's cool, though.  No, he has things to do.  Things.  He's got a couple things.  Actually, George had appointments. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  All right.  That's scary.  Here comes E-Rock.  Oh, my God.  Come on, E-Rock.  You're holding up the whole show.  You're holding up the entire show, Mr. Rock.  E-Rock.  Yeah.  Why the pajamas for Francine?  We were cleaning out the office.  We had a bunch of stuff.  So she's the only girl I knew that would take that.  She's going to wear it for the reading.  Why would you give that to a girl you're banging?  The only girl.  We've had so many girls come by.  Yeah.  Do you have something for her?  Are you getting a little stuff and feelings there? 
[02:13:30]  E-Rock has a little jungle fever, perhaps.  You want to get into that, right?  A little jungle fever.  Yeah.  E-Rock.  Yeah.  Nah.  She's a nice girl, but not.  You know what they say.  Once you go black, you're still dressed like an eight-year-old.  That's right.  That's right.  He's got his Popeye the Sailor Man shirt on.  He does.  Francine, would you like E-Rock?  Uh, yeah.  E-Rock's nice.  I'd like some of that colored pusky.  Well, blow me down. 
[02:14:00]  I like the knees gross.  I'll eat me spinach so I can fucks like a colored man.  Would you let E-Rock get in there?  No, I don't think so.  No?  Not a fan of E-Rock?  What if he just wants to lick the pusky?  Well, that he can do.  Yeah.  Oh. 
[02:14:30]  Nice.  Do your eyes bug out when someone licks your...  You see her eyes bug out when she was talking about pussy licking?  I like that.  Are you shaved or is it like the sea haggie?  Shaved?  She's not talking shit.  I like it.  Shaving a pusky is like taking the barnacles off of a ship's cull.  Makes it go faster.  She probably yelled out the worst shit when you're being sexual.  Oh, it's gotta be.  I mean, that pussy is going good. 
[02:15:00]  And all of a sudden she yells at something like, that door needs varnish.  Completely disinterested.  Right.  All right, why don't we go?  Let's go to XM.  He has a big fucking head.  Another awful day in New York City.  Fucking head.  Lots of umbrellas.  No rain.  Nothing for us, though.  To navigate.  Rain continuing until, I believe, Sunday.  Nice umbrella.  That's a good one.  That was good, right?  Oh, nice.  Yeah, make fun of people's broken umbrellas.  Yeah.  Like, gee, your umbrella's broken. 
[02:15:30]  It's broken.  Fix it.  Hey, Fabio.  That did look like him, right?  It certainly did.  Go over there and talk to him.  He's dreamy.  What's the matter?  This girl don't want to use an umbrella?  By the way, Anthony, I'm doing my own survey today.  Oh, right.  I see lots of cell phones, lots of iPods.  Not one satellite radio yet.  Hi.  I'm sharing one with E-Rock, girl.  Oh. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, just the hand.  That's okay.  I have a hand over my head.  That's all I get today.  No, give him the umbrella.  He does have a big hand.  I look like an...  You make me look like an ass every day.  Give my umbrella to Anthony.  I don't want...  Hey, that's a big umbrella you got there.  That's right.  Does it match your clit?  Ma'am, do you own a cell phone?  All right.  Do you own a cell phone, sir? 
[02:16:30]  No one wants to answer me.  Thank you.  Motherfuckers.  First question is, do you speak English?  Yeah.  It should be.  Do you have a cell phone?  Oh.  Fuck them.  Oh, you better watch it.  That was close.  That's right.  This lady's got one of those 1976 umbrellas.  The big bubble.  The clear one?  Yeah.  How you doing?  That's to fit that big beehive hairdo under.  Yuck.  All right. 
[02:17:00]  Not much going on.  Hola.  El Fono.  Oh.  The oddity.  Yeah.  Waiting out in the rain.  Hey, can we slide in a little?  Do you realize there's on-air talent getting wet?  All right.  We're ready to cross.  Oh, watch it.  I'm not doing anything.  I want to go across the street.  Let's just get to XM today.  It's miserable out.  What's this woman doing, waiting to be raped? 
[02:17:30]  Oh.  My girl and I are lagging behind.  Wow-wee.  She looks like that teacher.  Look at that blonde.  Doesn't she look like that teacher that-  Hi, miss.  Do you want to talk on the radio?  Deborah?  She looks like Deborah-  Deborah Lafayette.  Lafayette.  Lafayette.  Lafayette.  Lafayette.  Hi, miss.  Would you treat my mouth like a coal?  Thanks, man.  Wow, look.  There's a big crowd. 
[02:18:00]  Your son is attempting.  I like radio.  We can hear each other from far away.  I know.  I can't even see Jimmy, and we're just doing The Shining.  We're doing our road performance of The Shining.  Oh.  Oh, sir.  Where's the dope with the broom?  Exactly.  And the misshapen head.  I hope he's sweeping a tumor out of his lung.  All right.  All right.  Yeah, we got to go in because it's raining.  A quick one today. 
[02:18:30]  Jimmy?  I'm taking a picture with the broad.  Are you going to say hello to-  To what?  The guy at the desk today?  I've never seen a guy behind the desk.  It seems like every day somebody comes in-  Yeah.  You're welcome, and takes a giant shit behind the desk, and it just stacks up, and someone  throws a tie on it.  Let me see.  Is that what happens?  Yeah, there's a steaming pile of shit that someone dropped their tie in, and apparently  noise comes out of it.  There must be a transistor radio in there, too. 
[02:19:00]  He fucking hates that guy.  Oh, it's a different guy.  I like this guy.  Oh!  How are you, sir?  See?  All right.  Good to see you.  Hi, sir.  That's right.  A human being finally-  Just going upstairs and-  The other guy died?  Go radio.  The other guy died.  All right.  All right.  We'll be back after this very short break.  A war with no eccentric gear.  Messicans.  That sucks.  Lesbians.  I like that in a woman.  And every other kind of TV. 
[02:19:30]  I love paying for sex.  This moral decay-  Huh?  Weakens our resistance.  Dude.  The enclosque of the communist masters of disease.  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  I can't believe it.  It's a pedophile humor.  Woo!  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  It's a bunch of idiots.  Perversion for power.  Here it comes!  Here it comes!  The Opie and Anthony program.  El virus.  The Opie and Anthony. 
[02:20:00]  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that back.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down syndrome children.  No, baby!  That's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver. 
[02:20:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  But the guy said, let's get the show on the road.  That's what he said.  But everyone's peeing.  That's right.  I'm bringing us back from break.  The walkover is over, and it's back to the radio show. 
[02:21:00]  Here we come.  Ooh.  This is the Opie and Anthony radio program.  Syndicated a lot on the satellite.  Not Sirius XM, though.  On the thing.  Right.  On the thing.  We got Chuck Lydell.  Is he coming in, that animal?  Is that today?  No. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, is he frightening?  Oh, thank you, bro.  God, is he scary.  See you at FH Riley's this weekend.  How about the tango at Lydell?  Deanna, California.  What's up?  What's up?  I want to know if Otto is going to be coming out to California any time.  I don't know where Otto went.  We don't know.  Eventually, I'm sure he will.  He works all over the country, but I don't know where he is right now.  Yeah, yeah.  We don't really know where he is right now.  Let's go.  Mikey.  All right.  I guess.  All right.  We answered your question.  Go. 
[02:22:00]  Don't be mean to me.  Sorry.  All right.  Thank you.  I apologize.  Yeah, that was Jimmy.  We think you're terrific.  Miss, miss, miss.  Computer problem.  Computer problem on my pal talk computer.  Deanna, you still there?  Yeah, I'm still here.  Jimmy, now you apologize to her.  Listen.  Hey, I'm.  What?  You don't have to apologize.  All right, good.  You keep talking while I'm trying to be nice.  I'm sorry.  No, I have an idea.  Next time Otto's on the FM show, you guys should give him the bell so that whenever George  cusses, then he can just use the bell. 
[02:22:30]  That's a good idea.  Another idea that would be nice is if you turn over a lawnmower and put your face in it  while it's on.  It would, wouldn't it?  Why?  It's not a bad idea.  It's an awful idea.  Give Otto the bell.  How do you figure?  So he's got a puppet in one hand and a bell in the other?  Shut up.  Your idea stinks.  Maybe we should give him flowers, too, and do a photo op.  He's very good with his hands, apparently.  He's great with his hands.  He's a great comic.  Yeah.  But that's why he doesn't have to hit a fucking bell. 
[02:23:00]  He's busy thinking about George.  It's because of George.  Give Otto a bell.  Let him ring it.  Maybe go to the stock exchange and ring the bell.  Shut up.  Why don't you bring your clit in and let him step on that every time he curses?  Your dumb ideas.  You should give him your cock.  It's fucking, it's there all the time.  I'd love to see Otto give your mouth a good fucking, apparently he's got a big Danish hug.  Why the anger, Jim?  Why the anger?  I'm trying to be nice to this hole, and she's fucking being disrespectful.  She's getting fucking fresh.  Because I said you didn't have to apologize? 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, because then you start getting fresh about giving Otto a bell, and it's a dumb suggestion.  It's not a good idea.  It's not.  Okay, it might not be, but it was an idea.  Right, so what?  So is shutting your face.  That's an idea.  How about putting a fucking hose, a hose in your car window, and the other end in your  exhaust pipe?  That's an idea.  Really?  I missed something.  Me and this chick are actually, we're just asking when Otto and George is coming to California.  Oh my God. 
[02:24:00]  We're jousting a little bit, but there's vibes between us.  I don't know how it got to this point, but I'm enjoying the hell out of it.  Yeah, we're jousting.  Jimmy's being mean to me, and I helped him to find the fire song.  I was the one who called and gave you guys a little tip about the fire song.  Oh, did you?  Yeah, Jimmy.  Yes, I did.  Oh, I don't need you anymore.  Tough shit.  Beautiful.  Next time I want the fire song hole, get it quicker.  You know what?  You're the hole there, technically, right?  Robin's the hole, so the extra person is the hole, so you would be the hole.  No, I'm probably more the Artie Lang. 
[02:24:30]  There really is no Robin character here.  There's no hole here, lady.  But you know what?  Maybe I am kind of closer to the hole.  I'm certainly closer to the hole than Operantes, but I'm not as close to the hole as you are.  Putting that stink from your body on every pair of jeans you put on.  Not I.  Shut up.  Yes, you.  No, not I.  Yes, not I.  All right.  Not I.  All right, we heard you.  Shut up, Jimmy.  Stop being a dick.  Go fucking...  Good thinking.  Go take some...  There you go, broad.  I don't even know what you're going to do.  Nice try. 
[02:25:00]  Cunt really slows you down mentally, doesn't it?  Yeah, Jimmy, go!  Kitchen, bathroom, toilet scrub.  Hey, Jimmy, you go!  Dinner's hot.  Pump out, baby.  Jimmy, why don't you...  I'm leaking milk out of my breast.  Don't try to think with men. 
[02:25:30]  Here's what you should think.  Hey, Jimmy, why don't you...  Your pie has to come out of the oven.  You're hateful.  Thanksgiving turkey cooking time.  Put whipped cream on the pumpkin pie.  That's right.  Cough it up.  Oh, you're funny.  Are you pretty?  Who, me?  No, Opie.  I'm asking you Opie if he's pretty.  You fucking dope.  I'm not.  Well, Jimmy, holy shit.  Hey, are you pretty? 
[02:26:00]  Oh, oh, ah.  Shut up.  Well, I didn't know if you were done bitching yet.  Who knows?  Who knows?  Who else would I talk to?  It's all men in the studio.  It's all Aunt Kev, Steve, and Fan.  Who else would I be talking to?  If Travis was in here, you'd have a point.  Yeah, I'd say, well, I know he's pretty.  I've seen him.  Hairless little backside.  Anyway, to answer your question, I guess so.  I'm not ugly.  I don't...  I'm not conceited.  I don't...  Shut up.  I'm all right.  If you're all right, what seems to be the problem with you? 
[02:26:30]  Right.  The ass little...  Problem areas.  The ass little big.  What do we got going on?  Problem areas.  What are they?  What is it?  Go.  And don't lie or I'll know.  That's about it.  What?  I'm lazy.  That's about it.  I only...  I'm...  I am, I guess, 5'2", and I weigh probably 115.  I don't know.  I haven't weighed myself in a long time.  It's like you're a little chubby.  I'm not chubby.  A little bit.  115 for 5'2"?  Yeah, we'd like them around 100. 
[02:27:00]  You're like a square.  Muscle weighs more than fat does.  Yeah, does it?  Oh, that old gag.  You're believing that when your trainer tells you?  It makes you feel better.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are you muscular?  I would have dyes for...  Are you muscular?  Am I...  Yes.  Ooh.  Do you have a nice backside?  Yes.  Ooh.  But...  But what?  You're finding common ground.  You ever cut little stinkers into the sheets?  You're stupid.  You're stupid.  I'm stupid. 
[02:27:30]  I'm stupid.  How tall are you, Jimmy?  Are you...  How tall are you?  You don't ask me questions.  I ask you questions.  Oh, really?  This is not a fucking...  This is not an interview we both do with each other.  I talk to you.  You cook.  You listen.  I take my cock out.  Your mouth opens.  All right.  Hold on.  Debbie wants in on this.  Debbie from Louisiana.  Debbie?  Thank you.  Debbie?  Yes.  You're on the air with Jim Norton.  Jim.  Welcome aboard, Deb.  I love the show. 
[02:28:00]  My husband hates it, but...  Ew.  What kind of fucking homo did you marry?  Hold on a second.  What is he, a cuckold?  Do you bring home black guys and fuck them in front of them?  You like the show, but he hates it?  How is that...  That's not like any home in America.  What does fucking panty waste do while you're out fucking earning the money?  Does he have a fucking apron, world's greatest dad, while he's making Pop-Tarts for the kids?  Tell that lactating pussy you married to fucking man up and listen to the show.  My husband finds it to be a little strong language-wise. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, what does your husband do for a living there?  No.  You piqued our curiosity.  What's he do?  What does he do for a living?  He, um, air-conditioned and hating.  Ew.  Ew.  What kind of shitty job is that?  Air-conditioning, you know why?  Because he's always cold, like most women.  You know what, though?  Those guys love the show.  Yeah, of course they do.  That's one of our biggest demos.  Right.  One of their own.  All right, so you like the show because you're kind of into my cock and your husband hates it.  What did you want to say, Deb? 
[02:29:00]  Oh, no.  I was going to say, I love the show, but you're so mean to the women when they call.  We're not mean to the women at all.  I haven't heard one mean word out of Jimmy's mouth.  Absolutely not.  As far as women go.  I'm trying to talk to this fucking, this, this, this tits with a head above him, and all  of a sudden I'm getting disrespected.  Oh, my.  Easy, Deb.  Easy.  Easy, baby factory.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Debbie.  Deanna, anything else?  Hello?  Well, that's...  What up?  I don't even know. 
[02:29:30]  I'll call another day when his PMS is gone.  Good thinking.  That's a good one.  All right.  Clark in Sacramento.  Go.  How you doing?  Hey, Opie.  Yeah.  Got a Palm Pilot, cell phone, and an iPod.  It's for your survey.  Ah.  Jimmy, you roll.  Thanks, bro.  I'm punching out.  That's all you want to say?  All right.  He's also got a satellite.  I was only kidding, by the way, to the girls.  I know.  I love women.  Jimmy loves them.  But they don't know it.  I know.  I'm a sweetie.  Jimmy is terrific.  When I talk to a girl, I always hold her chin. 
[02:30:00]  Sometimes he goes...  When I scratch her neck, I'll go...  And then I'll go,  Oh, I didn't know you had this fuzz under here when I met you.  Shave it, monkey.  And then I fuck your mouth.  Peter, Long Island.  There is nothing funnier than angry Jim.  I'm not even angry.  I'm just being a cutie pie.  Being playful.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's how I joust to the girl.  Yeah.  She says potato.  I said cunt.  There you go.  Anthony, congratulations on your new car.  Oh, thank you, sir. 
[02:30:30]  I have a personalized license plate that I'm willing to give up for you.  Uh-oh.  What do you got?  XM 202.  It's a New York State Reggie.  Oh, see.  We can't do that.  Do you think I want to put a personalized plate...  Why not?  ...on my car?  Yeah, XM 202.  Vroom.  You can't put cunt on license plates.  No, you can't, but I don't want a personalized plate.  I used to have an XM satellite radio sticker on my car, and people started following me home.  So it's not the smartest thing for us to do. 
[02:31:00]  And considering they only...  They make the connection real fast.  XM, wow, I listened to Opie and Anthony.  Oh, my God, it's Opie driving.  Let's see where he lives.  Considering they've only made a very limited number of Shelbys.  Right.  Um, you're pretty much going to know it's me.  Right.  I don't have to advertise it with a, uh...  Oh, right.  ...with a license plate.  That's right.  All right, Pete.  Thank you.  Let's go to Eric and, uh, MD.  That would be Maryland. 
[02:31:30]  Right?  Maryland.  You suck.  What?  Jim, you suck.  Why, sir?  Why?  He's given us a lot of lofts already.  Lofts.  And Flynn, Michigan describes him as funny man Jim Norton.  That's right.  He apparently don't read...  I don't respect anybody...  Sir, you apparently don't read all the newspapers in Flint, Michigan.  Shut the fuck up.  Sir, you're just babbling and no one can hear you because there's a performer to...  Hold on.  No, don't cut him off.  I did cut him off because...  Damn it.  Why?  Because he was being hurtful.  So, call back, sir. 
[02:32:00]  I don't want you cut off.  Call back.  Uh, let's...  As much as I...  As much as I don't want to...  I don't like you.  I don't like you cut off.  Actually, we're just trying to, like, do things today.  All right.  Let him call back.  All right.  He'll call back.  Uh, Jimmy's chest.  What's up?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Jimmy.  Yeah.  You're the funny man in Michigan according to Flint when you come into Michigan to do  a show.  Uh, I'm booking a one-nighter on Tuesday since we're on in Flint.  I'm sure it'll sell out.  I don't know.  It'll be a little while.  Thanks, man.  Hey, uh, hey, quick question for Opie.  Opie, I'm begging you, please take the Bears against the Lions. 
[02:32:30]  It's too late, sir.  It's too late.  Oh, you...  You fucked me.  My picks are official for this week.  I'm going to win that $10,000 you watch.  You do the opposite of whatever Opie said.  You're golden.  That's right.  All right, Jimmy's chest.  Thank you.  You're in like Flint.  Well.  Please, please, please, next time take whoever the Lions are playing.  All right.  It's too late.  I'm sorry about that.  All right, boys.  All right.  Lions over the Bears this weekend.  Uh, Jay in Connecticut, what's up?  Opie. 
[02:33:00]  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey.  Opie, what are you doing to me, man?  You picked the Giants.  You're killing me.  I'm a fan.  You like the Giants?  Well, yeah, but now I can't even watch the game on Sunday.  Well, they're going to beat the Eagles this weekend.  You watch.  I have a lot of confidence in my football picks this week.  Well, yeah.  Well, I know the curse, and you've killed it.  Yeah.  Now what am I going to do on Sunday?  I'm just going to show you that I was just kind of playing all those years and that I  really know how to pick football games.  Uh-oh.  You watch, you watch what happens on Monday. 
[02:33:30]  Go Opie.  Five for five.  Opie.  Which will give me the lead for that ten grand.  I can only hope the curse is over.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  I can only hope.  Thank you.  All right.  I'll see you.  What is the big deal about this, Candyman?  Hey, I got to call you out, Opie, man.  Why?  When you guys talked earlier about Survivor, you know, the best you came out with is, you  know, their shwoogies would fall in the water and stuff.  Yeah.  Right from the get-go.  They get to the island.  Yeah. 
[02:34:00]  They start making a tent five minutes in.  One of the shwoogies, oh, I got to take a break.  I got to lie down.  Yeah, I know.  I saw that.  You know, and then when it's a puzzle, it's a puzzle.  They have to work.  They can't do that.  Did he really?  They had to lay down?  Yeah, one guy decided to get really lazy and just lay in a raft while the rest of the  black tribe was building camp.  Why would he do that?  Wouldn't you, if you were the black team, want to be the best and most energetic team  to try to dispel a stereotype? 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, but let me explain something to people out there.  Yeah, the black guy laid down, and CBS had no problem showing the black guy laid down  while the rest of his tribe was building the camp.  Yeah.  I would bet money that they have footage of every single person taking a break in every  single tribe, but they know what this whole thing is about secretly, so they're like,  well, let's have a little fun with this.  Look, the black guy's laying down while other people are working.  Do you think they're going to feed all the tribes watermelon, yet just focus on one as 
[02:35:00]  they eat it with gusto?  You watch.  They'll do a little of that stuff.  Yeah?  Well, yeah, they'll do a little of that.  So, I saw it, Candyman, I saw it, but Survivor's the type of show you just kind of, you know,  I'm reading books and magazines and taking a peek.  I don't have to study the TV.  Yeah, but I mean, the black tribe will be the first one off the island.  There ain't no welfare on that island.  All right.  Car crash.  We got it, sir.  All right, thank you, sir. 
[02:35:30]  Don't worry.  After the car crash, he goes, car crash?  No shit.  Do you want to explain this, Bob, in Pennsylvania, Bob?  Yes, Bob.  By the way, congratulations, Anthony, on your car.  Nice choice.  Nice, thanks.  How come, are you getting a little secret poo-poo from the higher-up stuff for not going  with the GM product, sir?  No, I own two GM vehicles.  I own an Escalade, and my girl has an SRX.  Why not three?  Because I really wanted the Shelby, and GM doesn't make the Shelby. 
[02:36:00]  Ford makes it.  So I am now the proud owner of not only a Shelby, but one with serious satellite radio.  Oh, that's funny.  I know.  Can you get XM put in?  I'm driving around.  I'm like, yeah, I can get it put in.  I will.  You should keep it.  Good enough, sir.  Good enough, sir.  All right, sir.  I was just, yeah, and the smartasses over there, a bunch of fans work at the dealership.  And it was tuned to Howard's station.  Oh, they just had to bust you motherfuckers. 
[02:36:30]  They're busting your balls, huh?  Yeah, busting balls.  Baking your balls.  That's pretty funny.  Let's go to John in Indiana.  John?  Yeah.  Hey.  Yeah, I'm here, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, I just wanted to ask you guys, what kind of other shows do you listen to on XM there?  Boneyard.  I had my Inno at the gym actually yesterday, and I was listening to Ethel.  Are you listening to Ethel?  I like Ethel.  I like Chill, XM Chill. 
[02:37:00]  I'm enjoying Bob Dylan's show on Deep Tracks.  Basically, music's what you're into then, right?  Lucy, Ethel, and I like the Decades channels.  Decades channels I love, too.  70s, 80s.  90s plays a little too much of the shit.  Like, shit.  Yeah, big tracks is kind of interesting at times.  Sometimes big tracks and top tracks.  Yeah, but you guys ever listen to like 163?  My favorite show before you haunt her.  Does anybody know if Cool Guy is still doing a show on Boneyard?  That was my favorite show, actually, even though we had a thing with him. 
[02:37:30]  I really don't know.  I love this.  See, the Boneyard goes too deep for me.  Yeah, it's heavy metal.  No, I don't mind heavy metal.  Does that really go deep for you?  For me, it does.  You're saying the bone gets a little too deep for you.  You know, I want some more hits.  That's all.  Yeah, but in all fairness, I haven't checked them out in a while.  So they might have changed and then threw a few more hits in there.  I don't know.  To be fair, I have no idea.  What were you saying there, John?  Yeah, like Channel 163 or 164, I heard a show on her the other day called The Celestial  Navigator. 
[02:38:00]  And there's this show on there about Annie.  And I think you guys would rip that up if you can figure out a way to play it.  It's kind of long, but I mean, it's got this retarded girl in it, man.  It just, I think it's got some killer humor in it, man.  I don't think they intended it to be humorous, but it's just the funniest shit, man.  You guys could tear that all to hell.  All right.  What's 163, first of all?  I don't know that.  Well, I'm not sure of the name of the channel.  It's just Channel 163 on XM, man.  They play books.  You've got a book shows and like a lot of fun.  Oh, okay. 
[02:38:30]  But yeah, if you can find that little Annie deal they do there by Celestial Navigator or  Celestial Navigation, whatever it is, you guys check it out, man.  I'm telling you, you're going to rip that up.  I think it'll be a killer bit.  Thanks a million.  All right, bro.  Oh, Sonic Theater.  Okay, Sonic Theater.  All right, thanks, sir.  Yeah, Sonic Theater.  That's it.  Thank you, guys.  All right, let's go to Chris in Toronto.  Chris?  Yeah, hey, boys.  Hey.  I got my Cleveland tickets last night.  Oh, awesome.  Hey, Jimmy, I sent you a picture of Carla last year with her tits out.  Who?  Carla. 
[02:39:00]  Carla?  Oh, from the transcript that we're reading today, right?  Oh, you sent me a picture of her with her tits out?  Yeah, don't you remember?  I sent you a picture of her last year.  So you sent them again?  I don't know if I still...  Did I ever get back to you?  Yeah, you said nice tits.  Not mine.  Not mine, hers.  Could you send them again and put who you are?  Yeah, I got to find them.  All right, we're going to read the transcript today.  It's going to be pretty unbelievable.  We really got to discuss this on so many levels today.  Yeah, and we got Francine, she's going to play a part. 
[02:39:30]  Jimmy's going to be the narrator, and Steve, I think, is going to do the other role?  Yeah.  All right, because Steve is...  Francine is sexy.  Steve is the best actor among us.  He's great.  MSNBC's and Nicole's son.  Murder?  With a question mark there.  Yeah, that's what you're starting to say, man.  Did you hear what a mess the room was?  There was vomit and blood all over the place?  Yeah.  With her trying to revive her son?  He's probably freaking out.  But there's something very suspicious about this whole thing.  There may be some kind of a cover-up. 
[02:40:00]  Is that your diagnosis, Dr. Jim?  He was probably freaking out.  Well, I'll concur.  I'll concur.  All right, let's say hi to our friend, Jim Gaffigan.  Jim!  Hey.  How are you, Jim?  How are you, Jim Gaffigan?  I'm just getting fat.  You're just getting fat?  Why are you getting fat?  I can't stop eating.  You're married, though, right?  I am married.  You don't need to look that mad at that.  I've got two kids.  Let yourself go.  Two kids, married.  Eat whatever you want. 
[02:40:30]  I thought that I was listening to...  High voltage.  You guys are...  It's a different show.  What do you mean?  I don't know.  I'm doing the free online thing.  It's different on 4XM.  Oh, online?  Yeah.  On the computer.  It's an old show, right?  Nah, that shouldn't be.  No.  Better not be.  What were we talking about on the version you were listening to?  We might have been rehashing something we've talked about 800 times.  Maybe he heard a commercial break, and he heard the old... 
[02:41:00]  Oh, you know what it is?  What?  It's just behind a little bit.  Oh.  Ah.  Oh, there you are.  I heard...  Jesus.  Rip into that girl.  How far behind is it?  Hey, Jim, are you filming something?  Yeah, I'm working on this show for TBS called My Boys.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, so it's coming out at the end of November.  You know, it's like...  I'm sure when you were calling in from L.A., it's like I got up at like 5, so I'm a total zombie.  I want to apologize. 
[02:41:30]  Are you in L.A. now?  Yeah.  Oh, it just stinks waking up, dude.  It was awful.  It's brutal.  Hey, no, no.  It says you're doing a town hall.  It says live at town hall.  Is that just a gig you're doing, or is that being shot?  No, that's just...  That's just...  I'm just doing town hall.  That's cool, man.  Yeah.  You have to get on those theaters, though.  It's fun, man.  It's really fun.  I wish I could have done some of those dates you guys are doing, but I don't know.  Yeah, some of the crowds were a little antsy.  Really?  You'd have loved Philly.  Yeah, they're all right, but they just like to fucking...  Yeah, have you checked out the Bill Burr clip yet? 
[02:42:00]  No, I haven't.  I've heard about it.  Oh, it's...  Everyone has heard about it at this point, especially in the comedy world, but...  Of course.  He's like Audie Murphy running in.  It's on YouTube, him taking on 10,000 people during the ONA traveling virus in Philly.  Yeah, it's...  The tour is pretty legendary.  You ought to get the Comedian Congressional Medal of Honor.  Do they have that for above and beyond?  No.  They should.  No, they don't, but they should give it.  You get a better class of box.  That's our medals.  You fuck chicks that weigh less than the ones you fucked last year. 
[02:42:30]  Whatever works for you guys.  I actually have to run to the airport, but I just wanted to call and tell you that I  love you.  Where are you flying to?  Yeah, where are you going to?  I'm going to Baltimore to do a college.  Baltimore?  Baltimore.  Baltimore.  Rowe!  Rowe!  Rowe!  Rowe, Jim Gaffigan's coming to Baltimore!  Rowe!  I gotta go see Jim!  It's like I'm calling in to brag to fly.  Yeah, I'm just catching a plane. 
[02:43:00]  Well, that's impressive.  What time's your show tonight, right?  Yeah, and I'm in L.A., so I'm a total zombie.  What hotel are you staying at?  The Holiday Inn?  Do they have a concierge service?  That's what Sal talks about as the concierge.  And you're promoting, by the way, that you're performing here at Town Hall in New York City  the 14th of October.  Tickets are on sale at noon today on Ticketmaster.com.  Yeah.  Go to JimGaffigan.com.  That's noon today for October 14th, Town Hall. 
[02:43:30]  You sell out everywhere, dude.  As a comic, I don't know if I'm happy for you or if I want to shoot you for it.  Probably shoot.  Yeah.  I only got love for you.  Thank you.  That's how I'm out.  Thank you, Jim.  All right.  Well, thank you, guys.  Your show was just great today.  Thanks, man.  Oh, thank you, sir.  Bless you.  Have a safe flight, love.  All right.  Thanks.  We'll see you next time you're in New York, Jim.  Bye, Jim.  Bye, Jim.  Bye, Jim Gaffigan, everyone.  Why don't we take a break?  We're going to regroup.  When we get back, we've got the transcript that Francine's going to help us read.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  We also have a nursing mom story. 
[02:44:00]  She wasn't allowed to pull out her boobies in Toys R Us.  Good.  We got the car thief thing that we never got to about blacks admitting, what's the story  again?  Says his job is taking white people's cars.  Oh.  And look at me assuming that it's a black guy.  What's the news there?  Look at me assuming it's a black guy.  Usually when white is mentioned it's black.  White people's cars.  All right.  I'll take a chance on that, the fact that I was right there.  And that wasn't what made you take a chance.  It was the word car thief. 
[02:44:30]  And other things.  We just got to decide which ones we want to do today.  So get us out of here for a little while, Derek.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[02:45:00]  Oh.  Oh, oh.  Oh 
[02:45:30]  All right, let's say hi to Gary in Buffalo.  Hey, Gary.  Oh.  Hey, boys, how you doing? 
[02:46:00]  I might have to eat a little bit.  I'm a little shaky.  A little shaky this morning.  Cupcake.  A little blood sugar thing is happening, so I apologize.  We don't get to take long breaks here.  Man, you could have thrown me a bone.  Give me five minutes.  You're good, nothing.  He wants another bone now.  They're working us to the bone around here.  Another bone.  Hey, Gary.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  I got a quick question for Jimmy.  Jimmy, any plans on coming up to around the Buffalo area or even better, someplace in southern Ontario? 
[02:46:30]  I will get up to Buffalo.  I live in Niagara Falls or even Toronto or something like that.  I live in Niagara Falls, Ontario, actually.  And definitely we'll get up to Buffalo.  Yeah, Buffalo's a great market.  Yeah.  I'll get up there eventually, and I'm going to do Canada, too.  I haven't done Canada in a long time.  We love XM Canada.  You've been up to Canada before, though, have you?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're going to do our trip to Canada in the spring now.  To Montreal.  It's already winter, so.  Cold.  All right.  Thank you, gang.  Okay, boys. 
[02:47:00]  Have a good day.  Oh, my God.  I'm eating an egg sandwich.  My mouth is so dry.  I drank my cold smoothie too fast, and now I'm freezing.  Wait.  You want me to snake my tongue in there?  Oh, my God.  This is so dry.  Oh, I'm in for water.  Drink something.  I'm eating an everything bagel with twerky.  I have twerky, lettuce, tomato.  Twerky.  And deli mustard.  Mustard.  And I'm... 
[02:47:30]  Cut it out.  Diet Coke and some almonds.  Almonds.  Which clips we wanted to play?  What didn't we finish?  Damn, that was the other station.  The nursing mom.  I just broke my mic.  Right.  Nursing mom.  Now you did it.  Why?  For what?  Jimmy, pick another mic.  Grab a mic. 
[02:48:00]  I don't want to have to lean in and talk.  You have to lean in now.  That stinks.  You broke it.  Why'd you break it, Jimmy?  What'd you do?  I was trying to try it towards me.  Did you punch it?  You broke it on purpose.  I didn't.  Did you hit it?  No.  You were abusive to it.  I was turning it towards me.  Jesus.  Well, I'm trying to enjoy my lunch.  Let's use this one.  Thanks, Dan.  Good boy.  Take that.  Don't bother me.  All right.  Welcome back.  How's that?  Test, test, test.  One, two. 
[02:48:30]  One, two.  Radio test.  I'm trying to suck the moisture out of the store, Murray.  It's because my egg sandwich is so dry.  Ew.  What audio were we in the middle of going to play?  We got the nursing mom.  Right.  Nursing mom.  This is a great little story.  Where are you guys at on the whole breastfeeding thing?  Hate it.  The kids tickle my nipples.  Oh, mothers.  When you see it, does it depend on how hot the chick is, on how hot the mom is, or do 
[02:49:00]  you hate it in general?  It's usually not how hot the mom is, because at that point, it's very rare you're going  to find a really hot mom, because obviously they have a new baby, so they're a little chunky.  Oh, man.  Problem?  Are you kidding me?  Problem?  You don't see hot new moms out there?  I said rarely.  I didn't say never.  Most of them are fat, because they just had a kid. 
[02:49:30]  Because they just had a kid.  I don't see that all the time.  And their boobies get a little misshapen.  No, they're all swollen.  But the nipples aren't riding.  Because the milk is just being produced, and it's just trying to hold all that milk in,  and it's leaking, and it needs to be released.  Is it fetish?  Ew.  I know.  Those are not random words.  That's the mantra he repeats to himself as he comes all over his sock.  No, that's not the nipples riding high, you know, nice, firm. 
[02:50:00]  You know, they get kind of sloppy.  And then a kid chewing on them is something that, no, it does nothing for me.  Thirsty work, isn't it?  In Silence of the Lambs, the book?  Toughened your nipples.  He didn't say that in the book, though.  In the book, he didn't say toughened your nipples.  He goes, did you breastfeed her?  And then there goes, yes.  And he goes, thirsty work, isn't it?  Or wasn't it?  Thirsty work.  And she said that hurt her because she remembered how thirsty she got when she breastfed.  Apparently, they're very thirsty when they breastfeed. 
[02:50:30]  Really?  Thirsty work.  I didn't know that.  I don't know if I'm for it or against it.  Like, I really don't want to see it.  But you have to be for it.  I mean, only repressed fucking American idiots would be against a woman feeding her baby naturally.  I would never, like, chastise a woman or say, get out of here.  But I think, in this case, the people that did try to, you know, tell her not to breastfeed had a point.  They had a point.  And I think it has something to do with our line of work. 
[02:51:00]  What?  To tell you the truth.  What do you mean, Eddie?  I think there's a similarity here.  What are you talking about?  I don't know.  I'm trying to get you to play the clip so I can comment on it.  Oh, okay.  Well, I was going to bring up a story from the old days.  And I wonder if E-Rock, now that we have all our tapes, we have our tapes, too.  Hoo-hoo.  Yes.  You know, the mom that was breastfeeding her three-year-old in front of us?  Yeah.  Well, how old was the kid, really?  Nine.  Eight or nine.  All I know is he was very aware that we were finding it very disgusting because he was looking up at us. 
[02:51:30]  Because he was pretty much smiling.  Yeah, he was looking up, saying, look what I'm doing right in front of you.  Hey, check this out.  I still breastfeed.  Yeah.  Way too old.  It was creepy.  The kid walked in.  Kate, her name was.  You remember her?  Yes.  How old was the kid?  Do you remember?  I don't remember.  Seven?  Yeah, it was like seven.  No, the kid wasn't seven?  Yeah, I think it was.  Maybe he was five.  Big Cat said five, man.  He's like, five?  Just put them together.  He was 12.  What?  No, no, no. 
[02:52:00]  Don't worry about it.  Yeah.  You got a dead soldier there.  Where's E-Rock?  E-Rock.  I don't know.  He's never around when you need him.  Fan's always here.  E-Rock, how old was the kid?  Probably around, yeah, around three years old.  Well, that's not what we said, so why would you say, yeah, probably.  That's good.  You came up with a whole new age.  Yeah, just go outside.  It was six months.  It was really disgusting.  He was agreeing with us as he came up with a new age. 
[02:52:30]  Did anyone else pick up on that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Eight months.  Just like you said.  No, yeah, yeah.  Three years.  No one said three years old.  No, we said five.  We said seven.  Seven and eight.  Do you know for, are you guessing?  I'm guessing, yeah.  All right.  Do we have that audio?  I can find it.  Find it now.  Not here, but we can find it.  All right, maybe we could throw that on on Monday or something or Tuesday.  Sometime next week.  All right.  Because it was so creepy.  This lady, you know, she outraged a ton of our listeners that day because the kid was way  too old to be breastfeeding, in my humble opinion.  The kid walked in with a little baseball cap on. 
[02:53:00]  She whipped one out, and the kid just started sucking right through the bus.  Then she called me to get the car.  All right, here's today's story about this.  Anywhere a woman goes, she's allowed to breastfeed her baby.  It's the law.  But one new mom says that Toys R Us broke it when they tried to stop her from feeding her son.  That's the mom.  Like most seven-month-old babies, Mason Meyerson doesn't like to wait to be fed.  And that was the case Monday when his mom Chelsea and three-year-old sister Olivia were shopping at the Times Square Toys R Us. 
[02:53:30]  Chelsea was breastfeeding him when she says she was approached by a salesperson.  She said it was not allowed and it was inappropriate.  And I said, you mean to tell me I can't breastfeed my child in a children's store?  And she said, no, there are children running around.  She was appalled that I would think that that would be okay.  Mrs. Meyerson says more salespeople arrived and she was told to go to the basement.  She says they even called security, but by the time the guard arrived, she was finished.  I was stunned and appalled and absolutely humiliated. 
[02:54:00]  I just couldn't believe that somebody would harass me for feeding my child.  Shut that kid up.  That she could respect breastfeeding mothers.  You know what, I'm not buying it.  You know, if you were so humiliated, why are you on TV talking about it?  Wouldn't you want the whole thing to go away?  Here's my tie-in.  And maybe get back at Toys R Us or something behind the scenes.  If you're so humiliated, why are you bringing this story to everyone's attention?  She's doing that so she can sue later on.  Here's my point with the show, how it ties in. 
[02:54:30]  At a Toys R Us, I personally could give a flying fuck, but it's inappropriate for her to pull a tit out in front of kids.  If we can't even say the fucking word tit, we can't say it because the FCC has deemed that scary dangerous for children to hear the word tit.  Janet Jackson pulling that fucking nasty thing out with that fucking thing on it during the Super Bowl. 
[02:55:00]  America outraged.  Why?  It wasn't because the guy might see it or that.  It's families are watching, and it's not their choice to decide whether they want to see a female breast on television like that.  Yet, a breastfeeding woman in Toys R Us where kids are running around can pull her fucking tit out with impunity,  and we can't even say the word tit because a kid might hear it?  Don't you think that to kids, very young kids, a tit is no big deal? 
[02:55:30]  A tit's no big deal to anybody.  Well, I think young kids, they see a tit like, yeah, so, and then the tit is taken away from them for many, many years, and then it becomes a big deal again.  A tit goes away.  Then I'm serious.  Comes back, and for different reasons, it becomes a very big deal.  I think if you were able to talk to kids on a level, like very small kids, they'd go, yeah, tit.  They wouldn't give a shit.  Boobies.  Boobies and all that.  Right.  Boobies.  And then it goes away, and then it becomes the wanted thing again. 
[02:56:00]  I side with the mother on this one.  I understand, you're right, the inconsistencies are, but that's not the fault of the breastfeeding women.  It's insanity.  The bottom line is this, we are a fucking bunch of sexually repressed, dishonest cunts in this country,  and if she wants to breastfeed her kid, there's nothing wrong with it.  And if a bunch of little dumb kids see a tough shit, be a better parent and say, well, that's what nature dictates.  How could that be the law?  She's feeding her baby, what's the problem? 
[02:56:30]  How could that be the law, yet there's a law against us describing, in graphic detail, a breast?  Inconsistencies, absolutely, but that shouldn't affect her.  One is us being titillating, this is what their argument would be, and one would be nature's way of feeding a child.  They'd probably put them on different levels of importance.  But the thing is, even being titillating, just graphically describing a breast on the radio, you can't do.  But you can pull one out live in front of a child.  Describe, you can't even say the word. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah.  Screw describing, you can't even say the word.  It makes no sense.  And I understand, you're saying she should be able to flop it out and feed anywhere.  Yep.  Yeah?  Absolutely, anywhere.  I know it's weird, and it annoys me, because I don't want to see that shit, but the bottom line is, it's, it's, it's, you're feeding your baby.  You couldn't be doing anything more healthy or natural than feeding a, you know what I mean, look, it's not my thing.  I don't have a pregnancy fetish, but for a mother to feed a kid like that, you can't, I mean, just the fact that anybody would object to that, it's just sickening. 
[02:57:30]  Plan your time better.  I agree.  Plan your time.  Your baby's going to be hungry, you should know it, not go to fucking Toys R Us.  Nope.  Or anywhere where humans are going to see that.  Or at least try to find maybe a quiet spot or something.  Keep it in the bedroom where it belongs.  Or just don't be mad at me if I look at it and squeeze my helmet through my sweats.  Hey, how about that, right?  And go, lucky kid, lucky kid, lucky kid, until you leave.  How about a guy walks up.  Yeah, you bring up a good point there in your humor, Jimmy.  She's breastfeeding at Toys R Us. 
[02:58:00]  It's the law.  She's allowed to.  What if a guy walked up, didn't say one fucking word.  Didn't crowd her, but just stood there and stared.  Now, what would happen there in that situation?  Would the guy be arrested?  For what?  No.  I don't know.  For what?  Just rudeness.  Would she get in a tiff with the guy?  Would she call security to have him removed?  Would she get up and leave uncomfortably? 
[02:58:30]  Next time I see a woman breastfeeding, I swear to God, I am going to do that.  I am just going to stop and stare at her.  But here's the thing.  There's nothing illegal about being rude like that, but if you're menacing her, she would  probably feel menaced.  Menaced?  Why?  I would feel menaced with her whipping her fucking tit out.  I could say that.  There's an aggression in that.  There's like a really weird aggression.  And let's be honest.  Men are not the victims of sexual crimes like women are.  That's the reality.  I mean, women are, I mean, 95% of all sexual crimes are most of the male and female. 
[02:59:00]  But you know what I'm saying?  Like, so there's just, there's another factor to a guy leering at you, feed your infant when  it's for sexual purposes.  Wouldn't even be leering.  Even looking.  Just looking because she's in a public place.  And if she says, hey, I should be able to do this in public, then you have to deal with  some of the consequences.  And I don't mean some guy coming over and cutting her tit off.  I'm talking about, you know, a guy doing more than just, because that's what pisses  me off about a woman breastfeeding in public. 
[02:59:30]  It inconveniences me in my, where I can look and what I can do.  All of a sudden, you can't look in that direction.  You can, though.  Yeah, you can just block it out.  No, you can't.  You can just block it out.  But just glance that way.  You don't glance.  You glance and you feel all fucked up about it.  You turn and go, oh my God, look what's going on over there.  Usually I just turn a little bit to the side.  And you gotta turn away.  That's a respect thing.  It's fine.  I don't want to.  Now I'm just going to look.  You want to pull that out and feed your kid?  Here.  I'm going to look.  I find it.  I'm watching. 
[03:00:00]  I find it interesting.  I was breastfed and it helped my bond with my mother.  That's right.  Did it.  And it's good for you.  I don't think I did any breastfeeding.  No?  I don't remember breastfeeding.  I don't know.  I don't want to hear about it.  I have no idea.  It's one of those things that happens when a baby and that's the reason you don't remember  it.  It's because you're not supposed to because it'll fuck you all up.  Don't talk about it.  Don't want mom saying, you were breastfed until you.  I don't want to hear it.  I love it.  My mom watched my sister be breastfed when I was like nine or eight.  Sicko.  No, it was cool.  I watched it and she was saying it's very natural. 
[03:00:30]  My dad told me what it was while we watched.  By the way, the official age of the kid back in the WNEW days, the kid was four years old.  Four.  And said something like, mama, I want nipple.  Oh, yeah.  He said, mama, I want nipple.  Nippy or he called it something?  Ninny.  Ninny.  Ninny, right?  Ninny.  Wow.  Andre.  What a dummy it's for.  He didn't know what a nipple was.  Andre.  Fellas, hey, I'm here in Boston.  Hey.  Okay.  Great show.  And Melissa, thanks for breakfast. 
[03:01:00]  And I remember the kid walking up, turning his hat backwards and saying, mama, I want nanny.  Yeah.  We'll get that audio for next week.  Creepy family.  All right.  That's great.  E-Rock's going to find it.  Sorry about that.  Scott in New York.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  I actually work in the Toys Roses in Times Square.  And, of course, details are left out in the story.  If you've been to the store, there's an area where they have loose Lego bricks and a play table.  This woman sat down on the floor right next to it, which we don't let anybody in the store do, and started feeding. 
[03:01:30]  Three different people came up to her saying, you can't sit there.  We have a place where you can go sit, feed your baby.  It's not a problem.  She refused three different times, and then two days later, we were approached by the group.  Oh, okay.  All right.  So then maybe she is just a lawsuit, attention-seeking pig.  That's very possible, too.  Yeah.  If she was humiliated, why is she on TV?  Yeah, she's probably just trying to go for a payday home.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  You're welcome.  A couple more here. 
[03:02:00]  Horny Hobo.  Yeah, what's up?  Hey, Horny.  How you doing?  First name, Horny.  Better than you.  Last name, Hobo.  Excuse me, man.  Horny for short.  I was calling to let you know that lactating nipples, I think, is hot.  When my girl's pregnant, man, ain't nothing like a good old titty.  That's good.  Remember that when you were in her closet, jerking off into her shoes and biting something,  like a belt.  Creepy.  Not sexy.  Lactating.  Fucking sweet, sugary milk leaking out of a nipple. 
[03:02:30]  Yuck.  It tastes good.  It doesn't.  All right, no.  You need to put it on some Cheerios.  All right.  The food of life.  Sweet, sugary milk leaking out of that big brown areola.  You want some sweet, warm, body temperature sugary milk?  It's sugary, so the kids will want more.  Let's go to class.  I don't like a little more sugary milk, mother.  Could you please put your nipple in my mouth for some sweet, sugary, life-giving milk?  I was breastfed until I was two months old, and then my mother weaned me off with a slap. 
[03:03:00]  Hey, Kara, Michigan.  You're on the Opium Entity Show.  I just have a comment.  As a breastfeeding mom, come on now.  You can't cover it up a little bit.  I don't have a problem with people breastfeeding, but cover it up.  All right, yeah, she's probably a showboat sitting down there by the Lego display.  Showboating.  Showboating.  I know where that is.  She was looking for some attention. 
[03:03:30]  Using no hands.  She wanted to be the lady that everybody gave a, oh, wow, they did that to you?  Yeah, all right, all right.  All right.  Probably wasn't even her kid.  Thank you.  Let's go to James from South Carolina.  Was that small black boy she picked up?  James.  14 years of age.  Hey.  Hey.  What's happening?  Your turn, James.  Go.  Oh, my God.  You get the call.  We were at a pool party on Labor Day.  Were you?  And this seven-year-old kid came up to its mom in her bikini and said, I'm hungry.  She pulled her titty out and gave the seven-year-old, started sucking on it and drinking milk. 
[03:04:00]  Then we find out that this old crazy bitch is making, she's pumping all the time.  She's making brownies with breast milk, everything with breast milk.  Crazy bitch, man.  That's taking over the nation.  She has sweet, sugary milk.  Sweeping the nation.  Sugary, sweet, life-giving milk leaking out of those big brown areolas.  All right.  Let's see what Toys R Us had to say about this, their response.  Toys R Us says it has a company-wide policy to accommodate nursing mothers and that, quote, 
[03:04:30]  Many of our store locations, including Toys R Us, Times Square, also have private nursing areas.  At no time was Mrs. Meyerson escorted from or asked to leave the store, end quote.  But Chelsea's attorney, Galen Sherwin of the New York Civil Liberties Union, isn't convinced.  This is against the law, and it's also against public health policy.  Everyone from the CDC to the Surgeon General to New York State and New York City Departments of Health  realize that promoting breastfeeding is what we should be doing. 
[03:05:00]  We should not be stigmatizing breastfeeding.  Chelsea and her lawyer would like a written apology from Toys R Us.  They'd also like to see all store staff trained in how to properly treat nursing mothers.  Shut up.  All store staff trained.  You know what?  She should have gone to the fucking breastfeeding room.  Yeah, I agree.  I will agree with that.  If they have a room set up for it, that's where you go.  That's right next to the jerk-off room.  I agree.  Jerk-off room.  For what?  That'd be good.  Look, I'm just trying to jack off here. 
[03:05:30]  All right, we'll go to the jerk-off room.  There's a room for it.  It's got a mirror into the breastfeeding room.  One of the mirror windows.  Fred Brooklyn, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Thanks.  One way to the road.  Anthony's saying that tits are no big deal.  I was at the PNC virus show.  Every time tits came out, it was like the scene from the fucking boogie nights or the accused.  Guys gathering around fucking making a big deal.  It's a public problem.  Are you insane?  Are you saying I don't think tits are a big deal like now for men? 
[03:06:00]  No, you said that before.  No, that's what I'm saying.  You think I meant like tits aren't a big deal like now?  They are the most insane thing in the world.  You're a mad person.  But, Anthony, that is what you're saying.  The caller's right.  I was saying breastfeeding women's tits as they're feeding their fucking little screaming rug rats.  The world's not women at the fucking road shows flashing their beautiful knockers. 
[03:06:30]  What would have happened if a breastfeeding woman pulled it out and did it in that parking lot?  Nope, wouldn't like it.  Discolored leaky nipples aren't hot ass.  You know what they're leaking?  Sweet, sugary, life-giving milk.  Body temperature warm.  With a tint of brown.  Oh, there's a little brown compression blood mixed in.  I'll just squeeze it into a bowl and whisk it into a meringue.  It's so sweet and sugary.  Make a lemon meringue pie.  You care for a life-giving milkshake, do you? 
[03:07:00]  All right, let's get Joel McHale.  All right, with the fucking Muslims being angry against the Pope.  All your fucking clerics criticize Catholicism and Judaism.  Fucking toughen up a little.  What a bunch of babies.  Wait, the Pope breastfed?  What happened?  I don't know what happened.  He said something about Islam.  Oh, they're angry.  Oh, they're burning things.  What else is fucking new?  What else is new?  We didn't like that.  Let's burn things.  I'm Frank the Fatwa.  Fucking barbarians. 
[03:07:30]  Fatwa.  All right, let's...  The Pope's a douche.  We all get it.  We got a breastfeeding expert on the line, Joel McHale from The Soup.  Yes, I am.  Joel, how are you doing?  Well, I think everyone is upset because that woman actually has three breasts.  Now, that would be upsetting if it wasn't for...  Oh, no.  Oh, jeez.  Joel, what happened?  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[03:08:00]  Were you just hit by a car?  Yeah, the car just flew right through the window.  You're on a slippery road today.  I don't know what happened there.  You've got to slow down your speed a bit.  You, now, you're married, right?  Yeah.  You have a child.  I have a child.  Breastfeeding?  Not you, of course.  No, no, no, no, no.  My wife was like, this is way too hard.  Yeah, see?  And we went to the formula.  Right to the formula.  That's what...  We're in 2006 here, people.  There's no reason to feed a baby like the cavemen did. 
[03:08:30]  Well, let's ask Joel, though.  You're walking around in public there, and you see a new mom breastfeeding.  Do you look?  Do you stare?  Do you walk away?  Do you ask for some?  What's going on?  It's interesting, definitely, because you don't see it that often.  And then it's always weird.  As you guys were already talking about, it's always weird when the kid is way old.  Yeah, it's creepy.  When the kid can talk and walk up to the moms.  We have a couple friends like that, and it really is disconcerting. 
[03:09:00]  Don't you want to slap them?  Well, not during the breastfeeding, but yeah, right after.  It'd be fun.  But I...  And also, I think that makes a real big...  It makes long boob if you breastfeed a long time.  Long boob.  You will...  Eventually, your boobs will be past your belt.  Yeah.  Hey, Joel, hold on the line for a second.  We want to take up the cause.  We want to help breastfeeders all over America.  Mike in Atlanta has a great idea, and I think we're going to run with this. 
[03:09:30]  Mike?  Yeah, I think you guys may be activists on this issue, and have a breastfeeding march on  your walkover, and have about a dozen women.  Can we get a breastfeeding parade together?  No.  Can this show get a breastfeeding parade together?  Where women just breastfeed on their way over on the walkover.  Yes.  Yeah.  Can we make this happen?  Like a guy on a flute with a little drum and a flag.  Great show, guys.  Yeah.  You could lead the breastfeeding women.  Yeah, we're going to need some guy with a drum.  Kind of like a 1776-type drum thing. 
[03:10:00]  Right.  That's good.  And we'll all stand behind jerking off.  Can we do that?  I'm not even kidding.  How many moms do we need?  Neither am I.  I say...  Yeah.  By the way, I think there already is a jerk-off room at Toys R Us.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I guess quite a few guys have gone in there for that.  I say we get 10 new moms for our breastfeeding parade.  Yeah.  Steve, should they contact you?  Sure.  All right.  If you want to be part of our breastfeeding parade, give Steve an email. 
[03:10:30]  Steve at FoundryMusic.com.  Can we try to do it a week before?  Oh, no.  We're going to be in Cleveland.  We're going to be in Cleveland.  Do it in Cleveland.  Where they don't breastfeed.  Can we do it next Thursday?  Next Thursday.  Well, shoot for it.  Can we get this together in six days?  Sure.  We're looking for 10 new moms to breastfeed.  Wow.  That's a lot.  On the walk from Free FM to XM Satellite Radio.  We're going to find that many new moms breastfeeding.  I don't know if we're going to find that many.  But it's a parade.  We'll get what we can.  We'll get as many as we can.  Even if they just have children like 10 years old, bring them.  Yeah.  They suck on a tit while they walk over. 
[03:11:00]  You guys, as an incentive, give them a year's supply of formula.  Yeah.  There you go.  Save their titties.  All right.  New moms, email Steve at FoundryMusic.com.  It's the breastfeeding parade coming soon to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Back to Joel McHale.  No, no, no.  How's the show going, Joel?  I think it's okay.  It's been a very exciting week.  So, I mean, a lot happened.  A lot of celebrity news.  A lot of Whitney.  A lot of Lindsay's vagina.  Yeah.  What's up with that? 
[03:11:30]  Is that a real picture, you think?  It seems to be because everyone's continuing to talk about it and there's not something  coming out, especially her people saying, yeah, that's not her vagina.  Jimmy is saying it's not.  I say no.  It looks like a Photoshopped vagina.  It does look like she was shot with a camera that ages your lower half by 60 years.  Yeah, it really is kind of hanging there.  I think it ought to be blown up into a poster with the old poster that was over Mulder's  desk in the X-Files, I want to believe. 
[03:12:00]  Like, I think that's what a lot of people are in the mindset.  They want to believe it so much that they're saying that it's real.  Yeah.  But if you really take a close look, you can tell it's Photoshopped.  Where is that picture, by the way?  Our listeners have been asking for it for a while now.  We could not license it, so we couldn't show it on the show.  Oh, well, I don't think you'd be able to show that anyway, right?  Maybe pixelated?  Well, we would put a little soup thing on it.  Oh, a little soup on it?  The soup decided to cover her vagina.  You put your own little soup on it?  Yeah, I mean, she's turning into Paris where she's finding something to do each week embarrassing. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  That's the new thing in Hollywood, huh?  Yeah, you don't need to be in a good movie.  You don't need to be a good actor.  You just get a DUI.  You get caught blowing someone.  You lose a million dollars in diamonds.  Whatever it is, each week you find a way to stay there.  Just stay in the news.  Hey, do you know about, do you really do a lot of research on celebrity news and things,  or people just kind of? 
[03:13:00]  Research meaning like...  Yeah, because I'm wondering if you know anything about the, what's-her-name's son there?  Oh, Anna Nicole Smith?  Anna Nicole's son.  Oh, no.  Gosh, that, because you're, I know they had to sedate her.  Because now they're saying murder, with a question mark on the news.  It says murder.  Well, the problem is that he died in the Bahamas, where I can't imagine the autopsy, doing autopsy  there, I'm sure, is just not as good as that.  Yeah, they're actually considering a voodoo doll as a viable explanation for the death. 
[03:13:30]  They'll be pins sticking out.  Chicken legs.  That's a phony picture.  How do you know it's a phony picture?  We got in front of us, Jimmy.  I can see the fact that it's, look at the way, the leg and the pussy are photoshopped.  It's obviously phony.  That's completely a phony picture.  Here's what's scary.  If it's totally phony, why is everyone, I mean, just think if it was a halfway decent job.  Okay.  People are dummies.  Let me tell you why also.  This is a different picture.  There was another one of her just recently getting out of a boat. 
[03:14:00]  Boat, right.  And her vagina looked very droopy.  And then all of a sudden, now there's a new one.  It's definitely the trend now is to photoshop her showing her snatch.  Are you saying that there are knockoff pictures of her fake vagina?  Knockoffs of fake vagina photos going around and making the rounds.  You could almost see where they photoshopped that in.  It's not a bad job.  I don't know, man. 
[03:14:30]  They're not really good.  Again, you know, I want to believe.  I want to think this is real.  I want to believe.  Not necessarily hot.  All right.  So you're going to talk about that on the soup this week?  Oh, yeah.  We have to talk about that.  And, of course, then Rosie, she's already said a thousand.  Can I tell you something?  She didn't think you said about the dog.  I'm sure you did.  Yeah.  People are making fun of us because we're talking about the view.  We can't get enough of it.  We can't get enough of the view with Rosie completely just taking over the TV show.  And everyone else pissed off that Rosie out of touch, Barbara Walters with the talking 
[03:15:00]  dog and what have you.  Yeah.  It is incredible television.  It's great.  From talking about her bush to from talking about the dog licking the butt.  What did she say about her bush again?  She said she was talking about, well, first Barbara was talking about bathing with her  daughter when she was younger.  And then Rosie said, yeah, just the other day I was in the bath with my daughter and she 
[03:15:30]  said, Mommy, when do I get my hair?  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  I bet you Rosie's bush smells like the scalp of a left fielder.  Why a left fielder?  Just because they're running around a little more than the right fielder.  Yeah, they're running around with that hot hat on their head.  That's how brilliant Jimmy is.  They're busy out there.  He even knows that the center fielder doesn't get as many players as the left fielder.  I'd bow to you.  Fucking asshole.  The left fielder longer.  No, I think it's turning into a circus. 
[03:16:00]  It's the greatest.  Yeah, obviously there's some tension there, I think, between Rosie and Barbara.  It's going to be her show within a year.  I think you're right.  Because the ratings are going to go up and the network is loving her.  And yeah, it's going to be her show and they're going to get rid of most of those players.  You watch.  Hey, do you try to get that little rat excuse for a dog on your show to say I love you?  We didn't get him to say I love you, but I did let him lick my diaper rash butt. 
[03:16:30]  That will be on.  I did do that yesterday.  Well, that's a must see.  You guys should film a vignette.  Yes.  Joel, you could take this idea.  It's a freebie.  Oh, I'll pay.  Every once in a while there's a story in the news about an old lady that loved her dog so much.  There's one.  We're still trying to find it.  We had the story on our show about a year ago.  And the old lady dies and she has no real family anymore.  So no one really discovered the body for about a week or two. 
[03:17:00]  And her little dog that she took care of started getting hungry and just starts eating the old lady.  Ew.  Yeah, ate her.  Ate her.  Body parts all over the kitchen or whatever.  And this was her loving dog.  That is awesome.  And see, we would go to the executives and say, we have this great story about this old woman being eaten by her dog.  And they would go, huh, was she friends with Hilary Duff?  And we'd be like, no, but she was eaten by her dog.  Right.  Yeah.  Where is she at the Fashion Rocks show? 
[03:17:30]  No.  Yeah, they would ask you, where's the celebrity angle?  Yeah.  Where is it?  I have just been handed the photo of Lindsay Lohan stepping off the boat.  And it's her with her panties on.  Oh.  This was the one they photoshopped.  How do you know they didn't photoshop the panties in to take care of her?  Why would you photoshop panties over a real...  Because maybe it's an embarrassment.  So she got her people, they went into a lab, and they photoshopped the panties on her. 
[03:18:00]  I don't think so.  I'd like to believe that theory.  Thank you.  Thank you, Joel.  Her underpants are showing.  How do the panties look?  Eh, big.  Like there's a nice fat bulge in them.  Oh.  Yeah, I don't think she's going around wearing no panties in situations like that.  What do you got on Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown separated?  Oh, well, at least those two finally found something they can quit.  It's, well, for us, it definitely means that being Bobby Brown will not be back with Whitney Houston. 
[03:18:30]  No.  My guess is Bobby will be doing a lot of embarrassing things in the next two or three years.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's just going to lose his money.  It's going to be the new slave of life, I think.  And what do you think about her?  You think she'll finally, you know, straighten herself out?  Are you...  What do you think?  No.  She's a wreck.  I think so.  She was America's, like, sweetheart for a minute.  There's never been anyone who's fallen farther.  Yeah.  I'm trying to think, or more, well, that's still alive. 
[03:19:00]  I mean, when she sang the National Anthem, and it was huge, and...  And she also still, to this day, has the biggest single of all time.  Yeah, right.  How about Bob Denver?  He fell.  Yeah, he did.  But he wasn't ever as big as she was.  No.  And then, I mean, you think she was a, I mean, she had number one hits over and over again.  She was like Mariah Carey and Christina Aguilera, but even much well. 
[03:19:30]  And she had, like, a good reputation.  Yeah.  Like, she wasn't, you know, a dirtbag or anything.  Yeah, movies.  And then she kind of disappeared for a little while and came back a crackhead.  Yeah.  She got that look.  Yep.  Her skin got really bad.  She got that turkey neck.  She was all sweaty.  And then, and then she, I mean, on that show, which was the greatest show of all time.  Oh, yeah.  You just, could you imagine spending any time with that woman? 
[03:20:00]  No.  No, I mean, what, they would just, they would just go to TGI Fridays and...  These answers are easy.  Well, I don't know what they're going to, I'm sure he's going to wind up back in jail.  But he will, there will be a clock ceremony, like, from Flava Flavin.  Oh, my God, I love that show.  In one of their futures.  We're not talking about the new season of Flava Flav that much, but, man, do I love  that flavor of love.  Oh.  Season two, Buck Wilde loses her accent. 
[03:20:30]  That was awesome.  Speaking of flavor of love, Deborah LaFave, they just showed her, the teacher.  Oh, that's Owen LaFave, her husband.  Yeah.  The emasculated husband whose wife had sex with a 14-year-old.  Yeah.  The hot blonde teacher, you've seen her, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's pretty great.  Wow.  Would you bang her?  I think the level of crazy in that woman...  Make your dick harder, right?  She's probably a good bang, Joel. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah.  Nice long neck.  What happened again?  Did she do something again?  She did an interview, yeah, and talked in great detail about the sexual encounters she had.  I swear to you, I defy one human being to show me a bad picture of this girl.  Dude, Deborah LaFave, how long has she been on TV?  About 30 seconds?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  Hold on.  We got a treat for you.  Deborah LaFave was on TV, I swear to you, yeah, for about three seconds. 
[03:21:30]  Jimmy now has a hard-on that is pushing the front of his jeans out like a circus tent fabric.  You're kidding.  He's bending his helmet.  He's kind of known for this.  You're known for popping?  He just all of a sudden, like, fattens up.  Now he's standing there with the head of his dick is somewhere near his pocket.  Can you see the movement? 
[03:22:00]  You're standing there.  Come on, it's early on the left.  He's making it twitch through his pants.  It's just involuntary.  It's like, hey, we're passing it to homo territory now.  No, we're not.  Yes, we are.  Hey, what was the name of that case in Colorado?  Oh, the JonBenet Ram...  You cut it out.  His penis is talking, Joel.  I'm sorry.  Oh, my God.  Are you saying you can see it past his gut?  It's going... 
[03:22:30]  He's standing up.  Yeah, and it's kind of pushing against his pants as he contracts the muscles.  I can't help it.  I do that.  Oh, my gosh.  I don't even want to imagine.  Is that normal to twitch your dick that often?  That horrible.  Like, when there's a girl leaning on it.  I had a girl leaning on it the other day.  But she wasn't being sexual.  She was being casual.  And I kept twitching.  And she finally moved her arm.  And I was like, I felt really bad.  Sorry, sister.  Was that at, like, a family reunion?  Yes.  My grandmother fell asleep face first in my lap.  And she woke up with a male on her chin. 
[03:23:00]  Wow.  I thought the devil of faith stuff was getting weird.  Yeah.  Let's let Joel go.  No, no.  I want to hear more about his erection.  Well...  It's like three quarters now.  Because since the guys are teasing me, it's going down a little.  Since the guys don't like my cock.  Here we go.  Maria Sharapova.  I don't know who that is.  Oh, yeah.  I care about that.  All right, Joel.  Not blonde.  Well, let's let Joel play along.  All right, Joel.  Say something and let's see what happens with Jimmy.  Well, okay.  Say a person's name. 
[03:23:30]  Well, you're not looking.  You have to look.  You've got to try to figure out what makes him tick.  Okay, I see.  I see what you're saying.  All right.  Dakota Fanning.  Oh, yeah.  A little bit.  A little bit.  I'm only half hard now.  Because the guys didn't like my cock.  Would you put that away?  What's that?  I don't think we have to say that.  Say that on this show.  I'm only half hard now.  Forget it.  We can't play the game.  Because the guys don't want to look at my cock twitch.  All of a sudden, it's bad.  I feel real.  I'm for sure we all feel pretty bad about putting an end to your... 
[03:24:00]  No, no, no.  Nobody wants to see my cock.  Forget it.  Don't beg.  It's done.  Why don't you go outside and get the fluffer to work on it and come back in?  No, it'll jump up again as soon as we get into this story.  Yeah, we got a crazy story we're going to get into next.  It would be very good for your Hollywood career to hang up immediately.  All right.  I'm not even going to tell you what we're doing next.  Oh, man.  Just imagine something really bad.  Yeah, but it's history.  No, yeah.  It'll be treated with all due respect. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah, let's finish.  That's right.  All right.  So, Joel McHale, The Soup on Channel E.  Duh.  On the E channel at 10 p.m.  Yes.  And it repeats a thousand times.  Yeah.  Right.  And it certainly does.  Very funny.  It's one of the shows I don't miss every week.  I do not miss it.  God bless you.  And congratulations on Letterman.  That was awesome.  Thank you, sir.  Maybe you could have showed a little clip of our appearance.  Well, I can explain to you why we can't.  All right.  Can I explain it?  All right. 
[03:25:00]  Here's the deal.  I don't like showing talk shows too much, like Leno or Letterman or Conan, because then  the network would be like, you've got to show that every time, and then it would just  be a show of those clips.  More work.  And it would be so much, it would just be more, it would be like, wasn't it crazy when  they did that comedy bit on Leno?  And I was like, no, that was a comedy bit.  But now we're obligated to show it.  Good point, sir.  Good point.  But you still own any of their friends, though.  What?  We're still what?  They're friends.  You could have showed a little clip.  Yeah. 
[03:25:30]  Well.  Just a little one, Joel.  Yeah.  Look, there would be an off chance of seeing your erection.  Well.  All right.  Maybe there's the two of them looking very handsome on HGTV.  Oh.  I can hardly wish my own mother a happy birthday, so.  Hardly.  Well.  Doesn't mean not.  That's true.  All right, Joel.  Thank you.  Godspeed, Joel.  Keep in touch.  It's The Soup.  When you guys are on The View, we'll show it.  All right.  The Soup on the E! channel.  Thank you, Joel.  Enjoy your next topic.  I'll be too.  I'm glad I'm not going to be a part of. 
[03:26:00]  All right.  Thanks.  Bye.  Joel McHale, everyone.  Let's go to Mike in Fresno.  Hey there, Mike.  Hey, Mike.  What do you say, Bill?  How's it going, guys?  Painted shutter up.  The reason why your Bob Denver line bombs is because you said Bob Denver.  John Denver fell, Jimmy.  Come on, buddy.  Now, sir, I wish you were here right now so I could put your face by my helmet imprint  and then flex it against your mustache line.  I was talking about fall.  Hold on.  Shut your stupid face. 
[03:26:30]  You name mixer up or bag of jism.  I said Bob Denver, meaning Gilligan, had fallen from grace because he was smoking pot  and doing a radio show.  I didn't mean literally.  Shut your mouth.  No, dude.  You made a mistake.  I meant Bob Denver.  I meant Gilligan.  I'm not going to lie.  I really thought you meant John Denver.  No, I meant Bob.  Okay.  No, I don't mean fell physically, dude.  Yeah.  I think Jimmy is lying.  No, I'm not.  I meant.  Montage is a better line.  No, it's not John Denver.  He's falling literally.  He fell.  Get it from the sky. 
[03:27:00]  I was talking about people who fell from grace.  That's the company.  No, you wouldn't know.  Go ahead.  You explain it.  You actually said the line.  Go ahead.  No need for me to explain what I meant.  I wasn't here.  You were in the room.  You talk.  I'm sorry.  What do I know?  I was just outside watching.  Let's switch places.  We'll bring Mike in.  Go ahead, Mike.  You know.  Opie Anthony and their pal Lil Mike.  We've seen that all over the place.  Mike.  Funny man dash Mike.  Mike, where are you playing this weekend?  Lil Mike.  All right, Mike.  I love you guys.  Bye.  No, I actually did mean Bob Denver.  I almost said Gilligan. 
[03:27:30]  I was like, how did that bomb?  I figured because Gilligan all of a sudden was a hot TV commodity.  I didn't know the history of Mr. Bob Denver.  Yeah, I thought he was doing radio and smoking pot.  I knew he was smoking a little pot at the end of his life there, but I had no idea about  the radio show.  I like almonds.  Let's go to Jason in Cleveland and then we'll take a break.  Jason, what do you got?  Hey, what's up there, fellas?  Hey.  What's up there, little Jimmy?  I'd like to thank you and your...  Everyone's fine and up.  What do you got?  Yeah, we got to get to the transcript.  Do you buy tickets?  We're doing the transcript next.  Yes, I got the $10 tickets.  Thank you very much.  Oh, nice.  Oh, the Jimmy special.  They're on sale. 
[03:28:00]  $60 in surcharges.  Very special.  Oh, sorry.  You go ahead.  It's your show.  You're right.  At least he knows.  At least he knows.  Blah, blah, blah.  All right, the $10 tickets have gone on sale in Cleveland for the O&A traveling virus.  They're going fast, people.  I've heard they were going like hotcakes.  We all know how fast.  Do you know I one time opened a hotcake stand because I figured they would sell quickly  and nobody bought them.  So what happened to the hotcakes?  I had to throw them into the trash. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah?  Well, I got my hotcakes, Jimmy, so thank you very much.  Why wouldn't a hotcake stand work?  I did it on the side of the highway.  I had a sign I made that said hotcakes for sale.  And you figured they'd sell because everything goes well.  Yes, but they were in a box.  I didn't have time to make them.  Oh, so it's like just a box of pancake mix.  Hotcakes.  Hotcakes.  John and Jersey.  I'm sorry, pancakes wouldn't smell.  Yeah.  John?  Man, I just want to say, Jimmy, be easy on me, man. 
[03:29:00]  I'm married to a big old bitch and I got low self-esteem, so y'all keep him on a leash  for a second.  Yeah, be nice.  I just wanted to say, man, this is one of the funniest shows you guys have done.  It's in my top five ever, man.  Well, thank you.  Thank you, mister.  I just wanted to kiss your ass a little bit, Jimmy.  That's nice to hear.  Thank you, buddy.  The sad part, he's only listened to seven shows so far.  He's a good boy.  But, all right, we're turning him around.  Lucy, Long Island, what's up?  Hold on, hold on, Lucy.  Stan, why are you holding that awful little football for hours?  It's bugging me.  I'm not sorry.  I'm just holding it.  Ew.  Oh, he was going to say I'm sorry. 
[03:29:30]  He's like, no, go fuck yourself, Jimmy.  He's been holding one of those little teeny tiny footballs ever since Free FM.  I hate the way he just, he just likes the comfort of it in his hand.  At least he's holding it and doesn't have one shoved down the front of his pants like you do.  Can't help it.  On some twitching mechanism.  I even have laces on the bottom.  This kid is falling apart at the seams.  And?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he is.  He's losing the money.  We'll get into it eventually.  A lot of pressure.  A lot of pressure.  Apple cheeks.  He's not shaving anymore.  Give him a kiss.  Yeah, he's just.  Yeah.  Wakes up in the middle of the night. 
[03:30:00]  Fucking yelling out show prep shit and falling back to sleep.  He's not happy and cheerful all the time anymore.  He's just crunching on apples all morning long.  Crunch, crunch, crunch.  Crunch, crunch, crunch.  Crunch, crunch, crunch.  Crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch.  Crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch.  Flip the apple.  Oh, there's the cork.  Crunch, crunch, crunch.  Cut the brown spots.  Crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch.  I hate mealy apples.  He loves them.  This kid loves fruit, man.  I know he does.  Crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch.  And fruit loves him.  Especially long fruit that can be inserted. 
[03:30:30]  Aw.  Aw.  Long twitching fruit.  All right.  Strange fruit.  Oh, Lucy, yes.  Go.  Lucy.  Oh, thank you.  You guys, you're supposed to be reading the transcript that I've been waiting since 9-15.  Okay.  Yes.  We'll do that right after the break.  I gots to tinkle, and then we're going to read it.  Where's baby doll Francine?  I gots to go to work.  Is Francine in her pajamas?  Oh, Kev's sore.  Yeah, put her in the pajamas.  She's already in her pajamas.  We'll see what that looks like next.  Oh.  Keep her in the office until we're ready for her.  Uh-oh.  Is she okay, or does she now have two holes in her neck? 
[03:31:00]  Hey, Jimmy, I don't want...  I just saw our intern leave the office she was in.  Oh.  Oh.  I don't want anyone leaving, Jimmy.  What's the transcript about, just in case people haven't heard us talking about this this week?  Very famous case in Canada.  Paul and Carla Bernardo were a married couple who kidnapped and raped and videotaped sex with two girls in Toronto, around Toronto. 
[03:31:30]  The girls were 15 years old.  It really is a sickening crime.  The guys in jail for life, they didn't realize how heavily involved the wife is voluntarily until afterwards they found videotapes once the deal had been struck.  And they were also involved in killing Carla's sister, Tammy, who was also 15.  Carla drugged her at a family function so Paul could fuck her.  And she died.  I think that death was accidental.  They didn't mean to kill her.  And so for the rest of their marriage, Paul would make Carla talk like she was Tammy. 
[03:32:00]  And they would always talk about the dead sister.  It's really, really...  I've seen photos of Tammy dead.  It's like choked on her own puke or whatever, autopsy show.  It was just horrible and creepy.  And yet when you read what went on...  And I had a girlfriend agree with me.  I read the book on them.  Some of the details, some of the things are really sexy.  And it's not about hurting the women.  The thing that's sexy to me at least is that Carla is such a fucking dirty girl.  Yes, she is.  Carla is a dirty girl. 
[03:32:30]  And we got the transcript of one of the...  One of the pornotapes she found.  Okay.  With just Paul and Carla.  All right, we'll talk about that next.  The National Board of Health and Luckyfella brand suppositories bring you your body and you.  Hosted by famed sexual behavior expert, Professor Jim Norton.  I'm a perv and I'm weird, but I'm straightforward.  Professor Norton outlines his very hands-on approach to sexual education.  Wait till your kids are sleeping and just lay over one of them.  They won't know.  Oh, Jesus.  What?  For example, the art of foreplay. 
[03:33:00]  The first thing I do is go to the bathroom and take one of those eight decibel shits.  Oral sex.  Why?  Sexual experimentation.  I was performing tushalinga.  And sexually transmitted diseases.  I wish I had AIDS so I could bite somebody.  And for the grown-ups, there's also a segment on marriage counseling.  Honey, you're 41.  Can I finally have the balloon nut?  He'll also stress the importance of lubrication.  You want it to sound like when your muddy boot gets stuck?  Like a quagmire?  Another word to the wise from Professor Jim Norton.  Remember, I'm the face.  What's up with the spinach? 
[03:33:30]  There's a spinach alert.  A bagged spinach.  Very dangerous.  You're getting E. coli.  One person's dead.  Many more hospitalized for bagged spinach.  How do you know this?  I listened to the winds on the way in.  At least one dead and another 56.  Uh, 56. 
[03:34:00]  Jeez, that would be 56.  Wow.  It's time to go home.  They don't know what brand or anything, so they're saying don't eat any bagged spinach.  I had spinach last night.  Oh, Jesus.  At least one dead and another 56.  I said it again.  You're kidding.  At least one dead and another 56.  As federal health officials investigated an outbreak of E. coli in eight states,  consumers across the U.S. are warned not to eat bagged fresh spinach.  Mm-mm.  Wow.  Some fucking Mexican shit on the spinach in the field. 
[03:34:30]  Threw it in a bag.  Uh, this just in, this just in too, John Mark Carr plans to fight five-year-old.  What?  Oh, oh, uh, plans to fight five-year-old misdemeanor child pornography charges to kill porn.  Oh, oh, yeah, the scroll.  He admitted killing a girl.  He said he's, he's saying that he killed a baby, but he wants to fight the child porn  charges.  But I don't have any nudie pictures on my computer.  Yes, I raped a child, but I did not exceed my bandwidth. 
[03:35:00]  Just execute that piece of shit.  Just back a truck over his head.  Uh...  Even though he didn't kill Ramsey, just the fact that you'd want people to think you did,  you have nothing to contribute to any of us.  All right.  Let's get, let's get the cast in here.  We got to roll here.  It's, it's quarter up already.  Yeah, let's go.  We got some sexy business to get to.  Where's baby doll Francine?  I want to see her in her little PJs.  That E-Roc gave her.  Her pajamas, as she says.  There's going to be an audience for this?  Oh.  What the hell is up?  Wow.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Way to make it as unsexy as possible. 
[03:35:30]  She's dressed like fucking Manny in Scarface when Pacino shoots him.  Is that our Hef?  You look like a, you look like a lioness.  Grr.  Wow.  Grr.  Oh, it's small.  Nice material.  Oh, I bet you the butt feels good in this.  Yeah, can you feel your butt?  There you go, Jimmy.  Who's your pal?  You are.  Thank you, Opie.  You have old lady panties on.  Francine, why don't you wear thongs?  No, I don't like thongs.  How about boy shorts?  No, but these are cute. 
[03:36:00]  These are pink panties.  Ooh.  From Vicky's.  Okay.  Vicky's?  Victoria's Secret.  I'm going to take you shopping there.  Really?  Yeah.  If you model stuff for me, I don't even have to have sex with you.  I'll just watch.  Okay.  Done.  You're serious, right?  Oh, yeah.  All she'll have to do is come over and put the stuff on and let me look at her at it.  I won't touch her.  You'll be all fulled up.  Can you please videotape that?  Yeah.  I'll buy her a couple hundred dollars worth of stuff.  Whatever she wants.  You jacking it.  That's a deal.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, of course I'll jack it. 
[03:36:30]  But so much.  She's at the look.  Just turn around and talk.  That's right.  Face away.  When you hear me go, count to ten and turn back around.  All right.  We got the transcript.  All right.  And this is my, I'm the, I'm the, you're a long-suffering narrator.  You're the narrator.  Here's an account of Bernardo Homoka video clip played in court during Bernardo's murder trial.  These tapes were to be played on two 30-inch video monitors at the front of the gallery, one on each side of the courtroom.  The sets were on a six-foot high platform that were directly sheathed in a somber black cloth. 
[03:37:00]  There were also two huge television sets in front of the jurors.  Just before the tape was turned on that morning, Judge Lesarge looked down at the gallery that was filled to capacity and issued a warning.  I want to caution the audience that what you're about to see next is explicit.  If you wish to remain, you can.  Nobody moved.  Play it, please, said Crown Prosecutor Ray Houlihan.  Pulling out his cock.  Yeah.  He heard, play it.  The first scene had been taped to the basement recreation room of the Homoka house not long after Tammy Lynn's death. 
[03:37:30]  Carla Homoka was on her back, lying on a rug before the fireplace, naked.  Her legs spread wide apart while she masturbated for the camera, which was positioned a few feet away at knee level and pointed directly at her vagina.  Whoa.  Gasps of surprise and disgust, perhaps even shock, along with plenty of embarrassed giggles.  It could be heard throughout the courtroom if the camera lingered on Homoka's exposed body for several minutes while she stimulated herself. 
[03:38:00]  Too many in the courtroom showing that particular video seemed an amazing way for the Crown to treat the woman who was scheduled to be their chief witness.  She was testifying against Paul.  I just threw that in.  Yeah.  For the previous two years, ever since her arrest, Homoka's face had been almost as well known as the Prime Minister's.  She had been seen on television in footage taken at her wedding with her friends and at her trial.  There had been countless photographs of her in newspapers and magazines around the world. 
[03:38:30]  But few people in the courtroom that day were expecting to see a triple-X-rated tape, a close study of the country's most infamous woman in a variety of sexually explicit positions.  The prosecutors, though, had their reasons for showing the video.  On it, she and Bernardo talked about the death of Tammy Lynn.  Although Bernardo's trial for her death might well follow his trial for first-degree murder, the Crown wanted to present evidence on Tammy's death as part of its general picture of the relationship between the two.  Homoka's dialogue on the tape, Houlihan had said in his opening address, had been scripted by Bernardo. 
[03:39:00]  That is, Bernardo had told her what to say when she was on camera, and if she didn't obey him, she was punished with a beating.  But what the court saw was a seemingly relaxed Homoka, pulling down her husband's pants, fondling his penis, which she called snuggles.  Snuggles!  Aww.  And then performing fellatio during most of the tape, stopping every now and then to talk about what happened to her dead sister.  Holy shit.  Now, here comes the dialogue with Francine playing Carla, our own Steve playing Paul, which Paul is actually probably nicer to women than Steve is in real life, and I will continue to play the narrator. 
[03:39:30]  All right, now, now, now, I just want to give you a little direction here.  This isn't just reading.  This isn't just reading.  It's acting.  Acting.  You have now, you got to deliver these lines.  This is verbatim from an actual videotape.  You will now deliver these lines as if you were in this situation. 
[03:40:00]  And these are the people.  Look at how hot she is.  She's a sexy girl.  She's a beautiful Carla.  And Paul's a handsome dude.  You got the...  I thought they were, like, older creeps.  I don't know anything about this one.  Oh, you didn't look at the front, dude.  No, I saw the picture.  Oh, my God, yeah.  No, they were, like, regular couple.  I thought they were just an old, creepy couple.  They were, like, one of those couples that everybody said, oh, they're the perfect couple.  Look at that.  Really good-looking.  Young, good-looking, have the world by the balls.  Yeah.  And, uh, oof.  Yeah?  Yeah, this looks good.  Go ahead, baby. 
[03:40:30]  This is now the beginning of the tape.  This is with Carla talking to, uh, Paul.  She had pulled down her husband's pants, fondling snuggles, and then performing fellatio during  most of the tape.  And talking about what happened to her dead sister, and...  Go.  Action.  I loved it when you fucked my little sister.  Homolka said to Bernardo, who was lying on his back beside the roaring hearth, moaning  softly while she rubbed his penis.  I loved it when you fucked Tammy.  I loved it when you took her virginity.  You're the king. 
[03:41:00]  I love licking your ass, Paul.  Oh, that Tammy would have loved to lick your ass.  I loved it when you put snuggles up her ass.  Bernardo could be seen reaching for his drink while Homolka continued to fondle his penis.  She did it for several minutes, but he never climaxed.  He took a sip from his drink, glancing at the back of her head while she worked on him,  and asked about the thoughts on the night Tammy died.  How did you feel? 
[03:41:30]  I felt proud.  I felt happy.  She replied, what else?  I felt horny.  It's my mission in life to make you feel good.  This is why I'm going to marry her, Bernardo said, looking at the camera and holding up his drink  while Homolka continued to perform fellatio.  Skull to the king.  I'm glad you made me lick her cunt,  Homolka continued after pausing to take a break from the oral sex.  Are you a fully-fledged dyke? 
[03:42:00]  Bernardo asked, a reference to Homolka having sex with her sister.  No, I'm not.  You were having sex with your little sister.  That was different.  It was my little sister.  She replied, stroking his penis.  Love in the family, Bernardo said.  Do you believe in that concept?  You know, I had fun doing it.  Homolka said.  You know, I liked it.  What did it teach you? 
[03:42:30]  Well, we like little girls.  I like you to fuck them.  If you're going to fuck them, then I'm going to lick them.  All the little girls.  What age should they be?  Thirteen.  Why?  Because it will make you happy.  But why thirteen?  That's a good age.  Because why?  He persisted.  Because they'll still be virgins.  What are you saying?  Bernardo asked, looking down at Homolka's head. 
[03:43:00]  She stopped to look up at him.  I'm saying I think you should fuck them and take their virginity.  Break their hymens with snuffles.  They're all our children.  And I think you should make them ours even more.  You're right, Bernardo said.  You're absolutely right.  That's a good idea.  When did you come up with it?  Just now.  She replied.  She resumed the oral sex for a while longer.  Then stopped and told Bernardo she had a surprise for him. 
[03:43:30]  She walked past the camera to her bedroom.  Beside the rec room.  Came back with a paper bag a few minutes later.  And sat down beside Bernardo.  Inside the bag was a brassiere and a pair of panties.  It's Tammy's.  She said, handing him the bra.  He smelled it while she began stroking his penis with the underwear.  Before resuming the fellatio.  A few minutes later, when he still hadn't reached climax.  She stopped and continued talking about her dead sister.  I want to rub Tammy's underwear all over your body.  She said and did so. 
[03:44:00]  It'll make you feel so good.  I'm so glad you took her virginity, Paul.  I wish we had four kids, Paul.  Yes?  So you could fuck each one of them.  How does the king like that?  She asked, stroking his penis rapidly with her sister's underwear.  Yeah.  He replied in obvious pleasure.  She continued for several minutes.  But when he never climaxed, she said.  I think the king should turn over.  He did as he was instructed.  Okay.  He said.  Because this little slave has some more things to say and do. 
[03:44:30]  Bernardo rolled off his back and got down on his hands and knees while Homoka positioned  herself behind him.  She then probed with one hand for his anus and began licking it while she stroked his penis  with her other hand.  She did this for several minutes and he moaned in pleasure, at times calling her his little  ass licker.  When he failed to reach a climax, they changed positions yet again.  Bernardo lay on his back again and rested his hands behind his head.  Homoka took a long-stemmed rose from a nearby vase and dragged it slowly across his chest and 
[03:45:00]  then up and down his erect penis.  You know what we're going to do with this?  She asked, holding up the rose.  We're going to take this to Tammy's tomorrow and put it on her grave.  Why?  Because it will give you pleasure.  You loved her.  She loved you.  You were her favorite, you know.  The things that you did, you know, I loved it.  The way you fucked her in, what, 60 seconds? 
[03:45:30]  She loved it.  She loved it.  Your titties are bigger than hers.  I know.  Want me to do that again?  No.  And they taste better, he said.  When Tammy was alive, what did you used to do?  You made me lick it.  She replied, resuming the oral sex.  And suck it.  And now I'm doing it on my own because I loved it, Paul.  I loved everything you did with her.  She was your little play toy. 
[03:46:00]  And we both loved her so much.  Yes.  Homolka agreed, fondling his penis again.  Line.  Two.  Oh.  I...  It wasn't highlighted, that's you right there.  Our little virgin.  She loved us.  What else?  I didn't give you my virginity, so I gave you Tammy's instead.  I loved you enough to do that. 
[03:46:30]  Homolka then talked about another time Bernardo had brought a young girl home and had sex with  her in the basement of her parents' house while she watched.  You fucked her.  Homolka said.  With this.  She gazed at his penis, tenderly stroking it.  You fucked her cunt.  She said.  She sucked you.  She sucked snuffles.  She put it in her mouth like this.  After more minutes of oral sex with no climax, she continued.  You put her on her knees.  You fucked her. 
[03:47:00]  And I let you do that because I love you.  Because you're the king.  She rubbed his penis for several moments before saying.  I want you to do it again.  When?  This summer.  Because the weather is too bad in the winter.  If we can do that, then it's good.  Good.  He agreed.  If you want to do it 50 more times, we can do it 50 more times.  She said.  A reference to him bringing home more young girls.  If you want to do it every weekend, we can do it every weekend.  Whenever we can. 
[03:47:30]  Because I love you.  Because you're the king.  Because you deserve it.  Virgin cunts for me.  Bernardo chimed in.  Yeah.  Virgin's just for me.  It'll make me happy going from one cunt to another.  From one ass to another.  Will you help me get the virgins?  Yes.  I'll go in the car with you if you want.  If you think that's best.  Or I'll stay here and clean up afterwards.  I'll do everything I can because I want you to be happy. 
[03:48:00]  Because you're the king.  Bernardo's still heading climaxed.  And Homolka shifted down towards his feet.  Oof.  What's these?  He said.  She started sucking on his toes.  First one foot, then the other.  Gotta treat the king like a king.  She said.  Good.  And what else?  I'm your little cocksucker.  She said.  My nipples are so hard.  I'm your cunt.  Your little slut.  Your little ass licker.  Your little virgin.  It's good to be the king. 
[03:48:30]  Bernardo said, looking at the camera and raising his glass again.  Homolka licked the soles of his feet.  I'm your cunt licking slut.  She said.  The keeper of your virgins.  Your ass licking bitch.  And I love you.  I want to marry you.  And that's where the tape ended with Bernardo still unable to climax.  Crown Prosecutor Ray Houlihan said the video would be played again to enable the jurors  to follow the dialogue on the second viewing with a transcript prepared by the police. 
[03:49:00]  But before the monitors were turned on, many in the public gallery got up and left.  They had seen more than enough of the illustrious couple on their first playing of the tape.  First of all, whoever got up and left, it was wiping cum out of their pants.  Faggots.  Wow.  Holy Jesus.  Now I think it's safe to nominate Carla for a good egg of the year award.  What a good egg.  The only bad part of that whole thing is that the little sister was involved and, you know, died. 
[03:49:30]  And the girls that they picked up were actually 15.  Now it's bad to do it with any chick, but they were also young girls.  But the sex between them two?  Jesus Christ.  And the fact if the sister had lived and just been, like, woke up with a hangover,  that would have been the hottest thing ever.  You made me lick her pussy.  Oh, what a dirty girl.  Filthy.  A filthy whore.  She's out, right?  Mm-hmm.  She did, like, 12 years.  She did 12 years.  Because these tapes were all discovered after the, uh... 
[03:50:00]  So what is she doing now?  Oh, the tapes of, uh...  I don't know.  Marrying some lucky bastard.  A little follow-up there would be nice.  Let's go to John in Pennsylvania.  John.  Yeah, I was wondering if you guys know any good doctors.  I could cut my cock off because it's useless now.  That's disgusting.  Yeah, you're right.  Yuck.  Take care.  Steve sounded like, hello, Sidney.  It was like the movie phone guy.  Yeah.  I was trying to figure out.  I didn't know.  Well, no, the movie guy?  In a world where people eat their sister's asshole. 
[03:50:30]  Yeah.  It's good to be the king.  Yeah.  It's good to be the king.  Let's go to Gary in Tennessee.  Gary.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  Who's...  Anybody missing the point here?  Y'all are just giving Francine another reason to fantasize about Steve.  Yeah, a little bit.  I didn't connect that.  No, I didn't either.  Hot.  Yeah.  What did you think of the story there, Francine?  It would have been hotter if it wasn't her sister. 
[03:51:00]  That's the only thing I think.  Talk about missing the point.  No, because I started having sex when I was 14.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How old was the guy?  19.  Yeah?  Real sex or blowjob sex?  No, it was real sex.  Oh, okay.  S?  Twice.  Little S?  Yeah.  When you were 14?  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  Twice in the S at 14.  Good girl.  Thank you.  You are really a nice girl.  I wonder I love you.  Thank you.  Sheepers.  Sense what a good egg you are. 
[03:51:30]  He got charged for a statutory rape.  He did?  She's such a blabbermouth.  She probably told everyone, Dad, guess what?  You fucked me in the ass.  He did?  No.  You know how my mom found out?  He accidentally left a condom on top of the television set when he left.  And my old sister picked it up and went to the bedroom and dangled it in front of my  mom.  And that's how.  Was it used?  Yeah.  It was used?  Dangled a used condom?  Yeah.  Was it empty?  Did she squeeze it out like space food? 
[03:52:00]  Did your mom smell it and go, Francine?  No.  She knew it was me.  I mean, I'm the only older, I'm the oldest girl in the house, so.  So she called the police?  Yep.  And did he go to jail?  Yeah, I think.  You were 14.  He was 19?  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  How long did he go to jail for?  I think it was like three days, and his mom bailed him out.  Three days?  Do you guys keep dating?  Yeah, we still fucked anyway.  Why not?  He lived downstairs.  Oh.  Wow. 
[03:52:30]  Jeepers.  Was he white?  No, he was black.  Aw.  It's a shame.  Sorry to hear that.  Did you give him hummers?  Must have hurt.  I didn't like doing that back then, but I did like once or twice.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's say hi to the wizard in Wisconsin.  Did you fit in half the head in your mouth?  Jimmy, you're a sick fucker.  Get that pop tent put away.  I don't have a pop tent.  I got one myself.  Yeah, it's hard not to.  A pop tent.  Oh, my God, man.  That's fucking sick shit.  So I just moved it out and made it consenting fucking like rabbit things. 
[03:53:00]  Yeah.  Man.  Look, whatever you need to do, sir, just take care of Snuffles.  All right.  A whack bag name taken yet?  I'm sure it will be.  Riven Ryder, I think.  Riven Ryder.  Yeah.  How's it going, boys?  Hey, man.  Yeah.  Carla there, ever since she got out of prison, has just been running around trying to avoid  the media.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  The papers there have been posting rewards for pictures and her address and wherever  she is.  And she's got confidential agreement. 
[03:53:30]  So the police can't publish her address and whatnot.  Huh.  Do they know what she's doing for like a living or?  Nothing right now.  She's just hiding at her parents' place and that's it.  I'd pay her.  She was.  Yeah.  She was writing letters to a guy in Montreal who's in a prison who's a sex fiend as well.  Really?  Yeah.  So she's into all this shit.  It's obvious from the transcripts.  She is one freaky bitch.  Well, maybe we're on in Montreal, so maybe she has XM. 
[03:54:00]  Maybe her parents have it.  Maybe she's a fan and after that reading, she wants to call in?  Yeah.  Carla, you know, you're more than welcome to come for a visit here in New York.  Do the walkover with us.  Have you seen a picture of her lately since she got out of prison, though?  No.  Yeah.  She looked okay, right?  She kind of chunked up a little bit.  She's not as hot as what you were looking at there before.  Well, dude, she could.  But as long as the same person's inside the head.  As long as between the ears hasn't changed.  Wow.  That lunatic is so.  That's some honesty for you. 
[03:54:30]  All right, Riven.  All right, boys.  Thank you.  All right, let's say hi to Mike in Tennessee.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, man.  Man, y'all just blew HBO's version out of the water.  Whenever they had it on autopsy, they took all the sexiness and anything out of it.  Congratulations, Francine.  That was the actual transcript right there.  Yep.  Oh, man.  All right.  Mercy.  Let's go to Pinchy.  Pinchy, what's up?  Mercy.  Yeah, Colfer, what did I learn?  Yeah.  All right, let's get out of here.  Sure.  All right.  Today, I learned that history is for facts. 
[03:55:00]  Yeah, we did learn that.  Hey, we did learn that.  Very, very good.  Cool.  All right, let's go to Don the Trucker.  Don?  Hey, guys.  Yeah.  Great, great story.  Missing one thing, though.  Needs a soundtrack.  I suggest Benny Hill music.  Well, that would have ruined it.  Yeah, sir.  Who could leak clear stuff with that music playing?  All right.  Wade in Toronto.  Wade, we haven't heard from you in a while, Wade.  How you doing, guys?  All right.  I remember you.  I remember you, Wade.  Hey, those are some sweet numbers. 
[03:55:30]  The last fellow that called was telling you that she's roaming around.  She's not roaming around.  She's in Montreal.  She can't move around.  That's one of her stipulations.  She was working in a hardware store, and she ended up getting fired from there because  the owner had two sons underage, and she's not allowed to be around underage people.  All right.  There you go.  There's the update.  All right, Wade.  Thank you.  I would have hired her.  All right.  Let's go to Daffy Duck.  I need an assistant.  I need a Canadian assistant, Carla. 
[03:56:00]  Someone talk to Carla.  Tell her to email me.  I'll hire her as my assistant.  Daffy Duck, what's up?  Hey, Daffy.  You're on the air.  Go ahead.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey, listen.  I thought the story was, like, totally hot, but, yeah, thanks for popping a bubble, Francine.  Ooh.  He got nailed for statutory rape.  Ooh.  That's it, guys.  All right, thank you.  Let's say hi to John Montana.  John.  You like the whole criminal portion of your sex, huh? 
[03:56:30]  Well, it was good.  Hello, this is John.  Yeah, John.  Hey, guys.  You guys have a great show here this morning.  I'll tell you what.  I run about four or five fucking people off this highway that I'm driving on just trying to get through that.  Be careful, sir.  All right, be careful.  Keep her between the ditches.  All right.  Oh, man.  All right, good, buddy.  Keep up.  You shake the trees.  I'll rake the leaves.  Yeah, ten floors here.  Jim, what did you learn on the show today?  The satellite radio will have two billion subscribers by 2011.  Ah, that's right.  Bigger than the cell phone, Robin. 
[03:57:00]  All right.  Tim the Trucker.  Tim.  Hey, what's going on, Oak?  Hey.  I learned that I did not know that Francine was that fucking hot, man.  Holy shit.  Enjoyed it.  Hey, punching out.  Y'all have a good day.  She's very sexy.  Let's go to Eric in Bethlehem.  Hey, guys.  I learned that I need to marry Francine.  Punching out.  All right.  Let's go to Casper.  Casper.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey.  I learned today that next time Anthony sees a lady breastfeeding, he's going to slip a dollar on her bra.  Oh, that's a good idea.  Very good.  Slip a buck in there and go, thanks for the show. 
[03:57:30]  Let's go to Pest Bowler.  Opie, you had the line of the day.  Where?  When they were talking about the breastfeeding room and you said it's right next to the Jackoff room.  No, I don't think that's going to win it.  We're actually starting a new thing.  The guys behind the scenes.  Thank you, though, Pest Bowler.  The guys behind the scenes are doing line of the day.  Yeah.  And they got the runner-up and then the winner for today.  Oh.  Voted by the staff behind the scenes.  Wow.  Anonymously voted?  Yeah.  This could cause all sorts of fights and stuff. 
[03:58:00]  It better be anonymous.  Yeah, it should be anonymous.  You guys shouldn't discuss it amongst yourselves.  No, it shouldn't be, like, written down to us.  We shouldn't know who voted and how we're done.  Things like that.  This will start some fights among us.  Yeah, of course it will.  But that's okay.  Let's go with the runner-up line of the day.  Does it need a setup or anything?  Self-explanatory?  All right.  Here's the runner-up line of the day.  The black team didn't get their boat together right away, and I'm saying, well, that's because they're scared. 
[03:58:30]  If the boat doesn't work, they're going to fall in the water, and they're not going to be able to swim back to shore.  Either that or they built a boat where they just lay on the bottom of it, head to foot.  That's the fun of the game, though.  And the cruise takes three months.  All right.  I get the assist from Opie on that one.  No, no, no.  You had the, that's the runner-up line of the day.  Yeah, I'm saying it was a nice assist, though, from you.  You set it up that way.  I gave you a nice bounce pass.  That's it. 
[03:59:00]  Damn, that was a good line, man.  I got all excited like I had line of the day.  I'm like, oh.  And I'm like, sorry, Francine, you found that offensive.  No, it's okay.  No.  We love the shwogies.  It's great.  Yeah, glad we brought a few over.  It's nice you're wearing jewelry like Miss Cleo.  Miss Cleo, call now.  Call me now for the ass sex.  Don't leave your condom.  That's right.  Baby, you've got to get a man who won't leave the condom on the television.  I know.  Hey, Mama Mia, what am I talking about?  I don't know.  That was not a good accent.  The accent was horrid.  Usually you do these impersonations. 
[03:59:30]  I think it's the real people.  Joey in New York, what did you learn?  I learned that it's good to be the king today.  Yeah, good call.  It's good to be the king.  I actually said to Gene Simmons yesterday, you're preaching to the choir.  Did you really?  Yeah.  Oh, you did.  I know.  I remember that.  A nervous scrotum neck to nothing.  Terry from Long Island.  Oregon, I guess.  Oregon.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey there, Terry.  I learned that Artie Lang is a fat son of a bitch. 
[04:00:00]  Well, that's what I was calling him over there on the FM side.  Kind of disappointing.  On this side, Artie is a fat cunt.  What are you going to do?  Fat cunt.  He's a douchebag.  All right.  Take care, girl's name.  Let's go to Jim in Georgia.  Hey, I learned today that 500 supercharged horsepower is not going to be enough.  Please post some video and audio on YouTube.  Oh.  That's not a good word.  And we did the, okay, let's say hi to Jeff in Tennessee.  Jeff.  Yeah, I learned today that there's blood in breast milk, so I won't be dieting on that 
[04:00:30]  any longer.  All right.  Very good.  Looks like strawberry quick.  Oh, thanks, man.  Opie was eating strawberries.  Strawberries.  So much of that.  He was eating some strawberries.  That's my gag, by the way, blueberries.  Let's go to Mark in Jersey.  Mark.  Yeah, I learned today that I think Opie is becoming a racist because  I think he hates Robin so much that he's using that word shwoogie so much, and I don't  like it.  I agree, buddy.  I noticed the same thing we were talking about while we laughed at Blacks. 
[04:01:00]  And one more thing that's...  I was at a weak attempt at human...  Hold on, sir.  Let me soak in that bomb for a couple of seconds.  Just basking it.  Wow.  Basking it.  Sometimes you foul one off.  Sometimes you have like a little bloop single.  I not only swung, but the bat flew out of my hand and hit a child in the teeth.  God, did that stink.  So, Francine, is Francine still doing comedy?  I got a show today.  Where?  I don't know.  It's downtown.  Nice plug.  Just go downtown Manhattan.  It's on Lafayette somewhere. 
[04:01:30]  All right.  That clears it up.  All right.  That's good enough.  Let's go to Dustin.  That's a good plug.  It's only Manhattan.  I want to see your act, Francine.  Yeah.  Dustin in Boston.  Yeah, man.  What are you doing in the beach?  Go ahead.  Sorry, Dustin.  No, I'm sorry.  It's your show.  Go ahead.  Yeah, no, but I fucked you up.  Go ahead.  Francine?  Yeah?  I learned that I won my mini.  Oh, really?  Are you guys really going to go shopping after today's show?  Not after today's show, but we will.  Sure, I'll take her shopping.  All right.  Victoria's Secrets. 
[04:02:00]  I have it right around the corner of my apartment.  And you get to just watch her, you know, try.  She has to come over and try them on for me while I enjoy the view, but I won't touch her.  All right.  No touching.  You're up for that, Francine?  Most definitely.  Free lingerie.  What girl wouldn't be?  Look how happy she is.  I love Vicky.  She is so going to do this.  I know she will.  All right.  We get it, Vicky's.  Yeah.  All right.  Here is today's line of the day.  Shut up, Jimmy.  Stop being a dick.  Go fucking...  Good thinking.  Go take them.  There you go, broad. 
[04:02:30]  I don't even know what you're going to do.  Nice try.  Cut really slows you down mentally, doesn't it?  That's the line of the day.  Yeah, that is a good one.  I got to say thank you, but I will have to say, build a ship lay at the bottom of it end  to end is a better line.  No, I like yours.  Who are you, Tony Manero trying to give the dancing trophy to the Spicks?  No, no, but it's the truth.  Cunt slows you down mentally. 
[04:03:00]  And it was better than us.  I like your line.  It was a good one.  I appreciate the nomination, but trust me.  What happened?  I don't know.  Just missing something.  Derek just threw his headphones off and stepped on them because he knows he missed the fucking  cue.  We're trying to develop...  Twice, by the way.  We're trying to develop this nice new bit and it's just...  Trying to develop a new character and a new fit.  Why don't you guys get the music in here?  Yeah, we need the music in here.  One of you guys who knows how... 
[04:03:30]  Let's take that responsibility.  Young Timothy Hutton is busy.  I don't know.  I think Anthony should do it.  I want my sound machine.  No.  But I have sounds.  That one we would need on every single one on like the same number.  Get him in here again.  Joey from Howard Beach.  Get that fucking vampire spelled P-Y-R-E.  Hello?  Yeah.  I learned today that contestants on Survivor aren't grouped by height or sock thickness.  That was good, too.  That's a very good line, actually. 
[04:04:00]  All right.  Can we go?  I guess not.  All right.  There we go.  Francine, have you met...  There you go.  This is one cat.  What's his name?  Wait.  Wait.  Hold on.  Yeah.  Not a rat, too.  This is Francine.  Would you like to take her into some type of eternal, I don't know, afterlife?  That would be quite pleasurable.  Yeah.  Wow.  Look at that.  You might get lucky. 
[04:04:30]  Hey, you get an eternal life.  You live as the undead forever and ever.  Why would you pass?  I don't want to live forever.  Why?  That's it.  I don't want to live forever.  La, la, la, la, la.  I want to learn how to fly.  La, la, la, la, la.  We're good.  No one will be fucking you in the ass anymore, I'll tell you that.  What, when I...  Turn around and bite him.  This guy?  No.  You become a...  Oh, don't you know how it works?  No.  He bites you.  And I'll live forever.  You become a vampire. 
[04:05:00]  You'll live forever.  But I don't want to live forever.  As a vampire?  It's pretty cool.  Yeah.  You're a night walker.  You can't go out in the daytime, but...  No, I want to see the afterlife.  If you...  If you live forever, you can finally see your race be equal.  I don't care.  I'll slow down.  No, you know...  It is forever.  I mean, eventually, it's got to catch up.  Does it?  Here's the key.  Mm-hmm.  You would be...  I almost catch up. 
[04:05:30]  Like, just miss.  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  Oh, my gosh.  See, isn't the future great?  Damned eternally.  Yeah.  Oh, my God, Jimmy.  I got to go all the time now.  Okay.  All right, he's leaving.  I'm tired, too.  All right.  God, I love that music.  All right, now he's gone.  Turn it off.  Don't try to make up for your...  Stupid.  Don't try to make up for your earlier misstep.  I'll play it extra.  That's what I'll do. 
[04:06:00]  I'll put on some extra music if the guys will like me again.  Wrong shit, dick.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, shit.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Opias spilt water all over.  Oh, that's good, Dan.  Have one napkin for the boss.  Oh, that's good.  You look at that.  It's half a paper towel.  That's all you need to clean this up.  Yeah, that's right.  Thanks, Rosie.  Instead of a fucking paper towel commercial.  Hey, take fucking...  Is this Roland's song good, by the way?  I don't know.  We don't know?  It's whose song? 
[04:06:30]  Roland.  Uh-oh.  Roland, whatever.  Oh, no.  Roland?  Wait, don't put it in wet.  Dry it off.  I was, like, ready to yell because he's playing music.  Someone brought in some paper towels.  Paper towels.  Be quicker, picker-upper.  Look at all the blood that doesn't make these.  Blur.  There you go, Opie.  Let's go to Dan in Deer Park.  Dan?  Yeah, you guys missed the line of the day when Opie said...  When Jim said that she was a show lady breastfeeding, Opie goes, she was using no hands. 
[04:07:00]  I was freaking rolling.  I'm never going to win line of the day, sir.  I don't think I'll ever win it.  I don't think I'm ever going to get one of those little trophies.  That cool.  Jimmy's got his trophy for line of the day.  That's right.  Where are you going to put it, Jimmy?  Probably on my mantle next to my other trophies.  I was voted boy most likely to brighten your day.  World's sweetest boy.  I was voted sweetest boy in studio.  I was voted with boy whose smile was most likely to be mistaken for sunshine. 
[04:07:30]  Boy with the rosiest cheeks.  And boy with the sweetest disposition.  By the way, there's so much water, we might get electrocuted.  So I'm going to start cleaning this up.  How did so much water come out of there?  It's still half full, though.  My God.  All right, let me see this.  Oh, Roland, Roland, Roland, Roland, Roland.  Talks like his tongue swollen.  Was his brain made in Poland? 
[04:08:00]  It's fried.  Roland books the show's guests.  But he's a big mess.  On the radio when he's live.  When he is reporting, he sounds like he's been snorting.  His brain freezes and he's tongue tied.  Bring him on.  Pot him up.  Let him talk.  He freaks out.  The mic's on.  He'll screw up when live.  Bring him on.  He screws up.  Roland talks.  He freaks out.  Um, um, um. 
[04:08:30]  Um, um.  Friday wide.  Wow.  Who was that?  Damn, that was good.  I don't know.  There's no credit.  Who the hell was that?  Just says Roland's song.  Who's Roland?  Oh, Dave again?  That same guy?  Jesus.  Dave is good, man.  Damn.  Good lyrics.  They're fast.  The whole thing makes sense.  And musically, very good.  Get in here, Roland.  That was a vocal accomplishment. 
[04:09:00]  All that.  I understand.  Did you, um, hear that?  Uh, just a bit of it.  What'd you think?  It was a pretty good, uh, song about you.  Yeah, I just heard Roland, Roland, Roland.  That was it.  Yeah, it was you.  Yeah.  And then he talks about, uh, how you, you know, you get a little tongue tied when you're  live on the mic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What does your shirt say?  Oh, it's from the killer song.  What does it say?  It's from the MTV Awards.  What does it say?  Uh, he doesn't look like a thing like Jesus.  That says more than that. 
[04:09:30]  What does he say?  Uh, I don't know.  Read your shirt.  But, uh, he talks like a gentleman.  Like you imagine when you were young.  You a killer fan?  Yeah.  Wow.  You say it with the emotion.  I'm sure he wrote it with.  Yeah.  Um, we didn't talk to The Rock today.  I do want to talk to him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's give us, let's give us a movie a plug.  Yeah.  It opens tonight.  Yeah.  Or today.  Go ahead.  This is Friday worldwide, right?  Yeah.  Grid Iron Gang. 
[04:10:00]  Grid Iron Gang.  Grid Iron Gang.  What other movies open up today?  He looks like a Doobo character.  The Last Kiss.  That was a really good movie.  Was it?  Yeah, it was really, really good.  I'm going to see that one.  Probably like the best movie of the week.  Yeah.  Why?  Uh, it's just a good story and great acting.  What's the story about?  Uh, a group of friends, like mid-life crisis type, making a decision because one wants to  get married, the other one doesn't.  But it's a good story.  Good movie.  He describes the story and then goes, but it's a good story. 
[04:10:30]  But I don't want to give away too much.  Too late.  Yeah, you've given us.  You've given us way too much to us.  You were hiding for over a year.  Roland, Roland, Roland.  That's good.  That's damn good, Dave.  Yeah.  Bumping in my chair again, Hawkins.  Stuff at the consequences.  You always sound bubbly and wet lately.  I try to push.  By the way, the oxy powder, I'm not shitting it.  My system must really work because I shit and it was kind of like, um, pudding-ish. 
[04:11:00]  But it didn't make me.  All it did, I took extra long.  All it did was give me gas last night.  Like, they were awful guys.  Like, the tight ones, like.  You know those, like, when you're fucking trying to squeeze it out?  And I might have had a young lady friend over.  Just a really good friend.  And I might have had to continually walk into the hallway and pretend I was throwing garbage down the dumpster  because I was closing the chute door going.  The best ones are the poops that heat up your, uh, jeans. 
[04:11:30]  Oh, dude.  Oh, you actually feel some heat.  They trail you?  Oh, you just feel the heat in your jeans and you know it's just going to be uncomfortable for everybody.  They're like shadows.  Right.  I love cupping those and fucking tossing them to the face of an unsuspecting invalid.  Somebody who can't move is just laying there with his mouth open.  Nah.  All right.  We gave you guys five hours and 20 minutes.  Absolutely.  Roland, any thoughts?  Um, go see The Last Kiss. 
[04:12:00]  Uh-huh.  What, uh, music are you listening to these days?  Uh, The Killers' new CD is really good.  It comes out.  What's it called?  Sandstown.  That drops live.  It's all about The Killers, right?  Yeah.  Uh, they're playing The Garden October 13th.  Madison Square?  The Theodore.  Did you hear the remake of For What It's Worth, by the way?  No, I haven't.  I'm trying to figure out the band again.  I got a picture of The Killers.  XM played on Ethel.  It was pretty cool.  I remember that.  Can we leave the show with a song that I thought was pretty cool, like a little Opie pic? 
[04:12:30]  By The Killers?  No, it's a new band.  Skit or...  The Givens Kids?  Bubbling Brown Sugar?  A Bubbling Brown Sugar.  I think it's called For What It's Worth, but it's not by Buffalo Springfield.  Wait, do we have the song by Raj and D?  We're having a party while Mama's away.  I want to do something a little different.  They're good.  Having her legs cut off.  That's the point.  We're selling off some shoes. 
[04:13:00]  A little pilot.  What, Kev?  Oh, you're looking eager.  Like you want to...  Oh.  Kev, as a plug, are you handing me that?  Kev's going to be doing something.  Yes, I will be at the Big Apple Comic Con and Sci-Fi Convention this Saturday and Sunday.  Who's going to be there?  Oh.  So many fine guests, Anthony.  I can't even begin to tell you.  Who?  Lori Petty.  Who's...  Oh, wait, wait.  Lori Petty.  She was in Tank Girl.  Yeah, yeah.  Tank Girl, right, right.  And the baseball movie there. 
[04:13:30]  She had the dikey hair.  Well, show favorite, the Iron Sheik.  Iron Sheik.  Oh, nice.  He's going to be there.  Okay.  James MacArthur.  Can I find it?  James MacArthur from Hawaii Five-O.  Oh, my goodness.  Dano.  Oh, wow.  Bookum, the guy.  And Joe Ganiscoli from The Sopranos.  Right.  That's Vito.  Right.  And superstar David Naughton.  David Naughton from American Werewolf in London.  American Werewolf in London or from the hit song...  I'm a pep.  No. 
[04:14:00]  Isn't that it?  He said, get David Naughton's song and play it.  Oh, that's right.  I forgot.  I have a question, too.  Yeah.  Find David Naughton's song and play it.  It's at the Penn Plaza Pavilion, 401 7th Avenue at 33rd Street across from Madison Square Garden.  Peter Chris from Kiss is doing a signing in October in Secaucus.  And you can find out about that.  Sure.  If they could, like, get me.  I don't want to wait on line all day because I'll probably be leaving here.  Ah, don't worry about it.  What?  David Naughton.  I'll take care of it.  I want to play this song.  I want a picture of Peter Chris, and I want him to sign something, if you will. 
[04:14:30]  I love Kiss.  I'll plug the shit out of it.  Okay, I'll find out where...  No, that would be payola.  I don't mean for that reason.  For what it's worth.  Are you going to be talking to people?  I am.  Yeah.  Do some interviews.  And doing some of your interviews that have been made famous on this very program.  I hope so.  The one-minute interview, I hope.  You have to get your recording recorder.  We're all caught up.  I have a question.  Oh, baby, what's the question?  Yes.  Baby.  Big Kev, are you excited about the convention? 
[04:15:00]  I am very excited about the convention.  Great question, Francine.  Yeah, you really are a tough reporter.  I don't know if they'll let you in the door.  Wow.  All right, I want to play a song.  You do?  Yeah, I was working out, and it was on my inno when I was listening to Ethel.  It's a band called Candy Skin, and it's kind of a remake of For What It's Worth.  We can't find it?  Hell.  What?  Listen to the beginning of it.  I've never heard of it.  Give it like 15 seconds.  No.  If you like it, we'll continue playing it.  Why are you going to hate it?  Don't hate on it now.  Listen to the beginning of it. 
[04:15:30]  Stinks!  Sounds like, uh, somebody with a dope.  Well, it's Sample.  It's Sample.  What do you think?  What do you think?  I've got to hear the chorus now. 
[04:16:00]  All right.  All right.  Hey, Pat.  Pretty good.  Let it play.  Record this.  All right.  I'll start it over.  Yeah.  Record this version.  Start it over.  All right.  We're going to leave with candy skin for what it's worth.

Oh, nothing's changed.  Where's the, uh...  Oh, no.  My act is...  Oh, you'll be surprised.  I don't mean your act.  I mean Delhi.  All right.  Listen.  Let's get out of here.  Wait, wait, wait.

Thank you, Howie, on the phones. 
[04:17:00]  That was it.  We'll play that on Monday.  I promise.  But I want to play this.  So, it's for what it's worth.  I don't know.  If you like it, cool.  If not, go to another channel.  But make sure you come back for Ron and Fez, okay?  Ron and Fez.  I liked it.  I was turned on to it yesterday.  Candy skins for what it's worth.  Check it out.  We'll see you guys Monday.  Have a great weekend.  I'll be at FH Riley's in Huntington all weekend long.  Buying drinks.  400 New York Avenue.  What?  You said buying drinks before.  Everybody.  Opie was buying drinks.  What?

[04:18:30]  This battle line's been drawn.  Nobody's right.  If everybody's wrong.  Young people peek in their minds.  Getting so much resistance from behind.  You better stop.  Hey, what's that sound?  Everybody look what's going down. 
[04:19:00]  What a guilty for the heat.  What a thousand people in the street.  I'm singing songs.  I'm singing songs and I'm carrying signs.  I'm mostly afraid.  I'm afraid for our time.  You better stop. 
[04:19:30]  You better stop.  Hey, what's that sound?  Everybody look what's going down.  You better stop.  Hey, what's that sound?  Everybody look what's going down.  Paranoia strikes me  Into your life it will cruise  It hurts you when you're always afraid 
[04:20:00]  Step out of line, the men come  And take you away  You better stop, hey, watch that sound  Everybody loves what you're going  You better stop, hey, watch that sound  Everybody loves what you're going  You better stop, hey, watch that sound  Everybody loves what you're going  You better stop, hey, watch that sound  Everybody loves what you're going  guitar solo

[04:21:00]  Unpredictable, unleashed, unruly 
[04:21:30]  Unwashed, unkempt, I stink  Next thing I knew, I had my pants down, around my knees  And my shirt pulled up to my armpits  Shut up!  Oh, who cares?  I can't believe you fell for that again  Damn you, Hawk!  Virgin's just for me  It'll make me happy  Going from one cunt to another  From one ass to another </pre>
