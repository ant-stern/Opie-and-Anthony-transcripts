<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy Norton, engaging in self-deprecating humor, calling themselves names like "radio retards" and "perverts." They similarly insulted their crew members.  A substantial portion of the broadcast was dedicated to mocking Howard Stern, his move to satellite radio, his perceived lack of enthusiasm, and  the hosts' boastful claims of surpassing Stern's audience. This discussion included the reading of anti-Semitic slurs from listener submissions, which the hosts explicitly disclaimed.  A caller claiming to be a Stern fan was challenged and dismissed.

Next, the hosts recounted their experience at a Derek Jeter charity fundraiser, detailing their hangovers and blaming their boss, Elo, for their excessive drinking.  Norton's relentless pursuit of celebrity photos, particularly his frustration with Derek Jeter's refusal to sign an autograph and a negative encounter with an unnamed Yankee player, dominated this segment.  The hosts also discussed their interactions with other attendees, including Joe Buck and Jim LaRrizz (who surprisingly didn't recognize them).  The discussion included complaints about the poor quality of the gift basket at their $20,000 table, and Norton's boisterous auction bidding.  The hosts also announced that they were ending their interviews with the New York Post due to a perceived mishandling of an article about Norton.  Bob Kelly, a comedian, was mentioned as being a guest in the studio during this portion.

The show then transitioned to a discussion about Brazilian waxes, prompted by Opie's experience.  This led to humorous descriptions of Opie's body hair and the Polish woman who waxed him. This flowed into a lengthy segment mocking a rival radio show's "Man-Town" bit, playing a crude audio clip and offering heavy criticism. Bob Kelly remained in studio during this segment. Frank the Frowner, another guest, participated in a silent and morose segment punctuated by bizarre interjections.  A news segment about a death at Disney World and an upcoming trip for a host followed, interspersed with further off-color commentary and a brief segment featuring funny 911 call recordings. The broadcast included a chaotic outdoor segment with confrontations and more off-color commentary.

A later segment detailed a bizarre sexual encounter Jimmy Norton had with a masseuse, involving unusual manual stimulation and explicit descriptions, prompting discussion and crude humor from the hosts and callers. Other topics included a discussion of Pat from Menaki's buttocks, unsuccessful attempts to get Pat on the air to show it, audio of Frank the Frowner's awkward elevator comments, various listener calls, Kenny's departure for Disney, food-related incidents (a partially cooked egg, a thrown bagel), and a discussion about a legal case involving a thrown-out confession and double jeopardy.

The show concluded with a segment focused on the heavily ridiculed hairstyle of studio employee Eric ("E-Rock"), and a prank involving Bob Kelly.  While Kelly read E-Rock’s blog, Pat from Munaki dropped his pants, exposing his buttocks.  This escalated to Pat holding Bob’s cell phone against his anus, taking a photo, and showing it to Bob, causing him to vomit.  Following this, Bob left the studio, visibly upset and potentially ill, and Pat briefly took over the show. The hosts used highly offensive and vulgar language throughout the prank.  The broadcast ended prematurely.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Can you hear me?  No!  Shut up!  I'm here, Anthony!  We're so excited to be back.  Rapid radio retards.  Wow!  We're dummies!  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news.  We're perverts.  Stupid.  We stink.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show.  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony.  Opie, I love the hitting and the fighting. 
[00:00:30]  Anthony, I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  James, I'm a speechless, worthless nothing.  We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slump, fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  He's a hair like Chuck.  No, no!  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating poop that we paint him out to be.  Rice.  E-Rock!  Oh, please, go into a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table.  I don't care!  Shut up!  No.  What's wrong, Eric?  My closet's burning so bad. 
[00:01:00]  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opian Atlas.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  It stinks and I don't like it. 
[00:01:30]  It stinks and I don't like it.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go on, leave.  Leave.  I'll pardon you.  He stinks and I don't like it.  Good morning and welcome to the Opian Anthony show. 
[00:02:00]  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Thanks for giving us a chance.  Thanks for spreading the virus to the newbies out there. 
[00:02:30]  Newbies.  We greatly appreciate it.  We greatly appreciate it.  A lot of people trying to figure out the show still.  Figure it out.  What's there to figure?  Figure out the players.  Figure out all the inside jokes.  All that crap.  Oh, that stuff comes so naturally and quickly to people.  Well, there is a good website to check out if you want to be a pest of this fine, fine show.  And you want to know everything about it.  And don't worry, there's no porn on this website, so let me promote it. 
[00:03:00]  It's www.oapedia.com.  O-A-P-E-D-I-A.com.  O-A-P-E-D-I-A.com.  They'll answer a lot of the questions for you.  Yeah.  It's kind of a rundown of who we are.  Because let's remember, West Palm Beach said we talk like everyone knows who we are.  They talk like everyone knows who the hell they are.  We're in no better shape now than we were. 
[00:03:30]  We're chavily wrong.  Beside myself is very, very frightening.  Let's get this out of the way right off the bat.  Chris in Jersey, go.  Baba booey, baba booey.  Oh, okay.  Thank you, Chris.  Anything else, Chris?  Yeah, you guys.  Talk, you're a bunch of Howard Stern hacks.  Anything else from this century, maybe, that you want to do?  Instead of something from, like, 1994, Chris?  Ooh, Anthony, every day it's with that.  Ooh, 1995.  Yeah, how about that?  Yeah, that's when he was popular. 
[00:04:00]  That's when he had the most fans he's ever had.  And then it's been a steady downcline to satellite radio exclusively, where he has no listeners.  Chris, Chris, we're on more people's radios every morning than your hero, Howard.  And again, another Friday, another Friday of Howard fans calling up because why?  Because he's not even on for you, Chris.  He's not even on.  He takes Friday off because he cares so much about Chris from Jersey and the rest of his 
[00:04:30]  hardcore fan base that is getting smaller and smaller and smaller, Chris, right?  You're so right, Anthony.  Yep.  Ramon, Tim, Howard Stern, and his biggest hardcore fan base.  Holy cow.  Wow.  And you could tell by that alone that he's a fan.  And, like, it's just a mess.  It was a bunch of curses at the end of that phone call.  And actually, no one's going to believe us. 
[00:05:00]  They barely got through.  Nobody's going to believe us, but the curse actually made it perfectly clear that he's actually  a fan of our show.  He's a fan?  But I know they had to dump out of the last four seconds of the call, so now you think  it really was a Howard fan.  Was he a fan or was he, like, goofing on the Ramon bit?  Oh, I couldn't tell.  All right, so maybe it wasn't a fan.  Whatever.  Whatever.  The fact is, Howard's not working.  He doesn't work Fridays.  He's not working the whole month of August.  He has no passion to do radio anymore. 
[00:05:30]  He wasn't able to adapt to the FCC and what they got going on.  So guess what?  He's on satellite radio exclusively.  Good for him.  Good for the company he works for.  But he's talking to nobody.  We're talking to probably 10 times more people than he is.  At least 10 times.  Easily.  And people just, you know, they have nothing to listen to.  Where's that revolution?  Where's that revolution?  Ooh, the big fist in the air logo.  Wow, what a revolution.  You know what the revolution is? 
[00:06:00]  The people leaving his show and coming to anything else they could listen to because he's taking off.  And the fist thing is a hidden, you know, sign, right?  A hidden signal.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's what he's giving his listeners.  The big fist logo.  His old listeners and the ones that did follow him to satellite believing that he was actually going to, you know, reinvent radio again.  That logo is nothing about power.  That fist is for his listeners because that's what he did to most of them.  It's not about power.  He gave you the big fist, didn't he? 
[00:06:30]  Right.  Didn't he?  Good luck to you.  Because he, too, could have done this same, like, deal we did.  He could have done satellite and he could have done regular radio.  But the fact is, his show never really changed.  Yeah, it was too easy to just bitch about it and complain about the FCC, Robin.  They're after me all the time.  The government, George Bush.  Everybody's after me.  I can't do radio.  I can't do it anymore.  Tom, I can't do radio anymore. 
[00:07:00]  I got persecuted.  He couldn't adapt to the rules that are in place.  Yeah, we don't like him either.  Believe me.  It would be very nice if you could get on the public airwaves and voice your opinions the way real people talk.  Unfortunately, there are rules in place that have been put in place that have gotten tougher over the years.  We understand that.  And like old people trying to deal with electronic devices, he wasn't able to update himself and do a program that people find entertaining within the guidelines. 
[00:07:30]  So guess what?  We stepped in.  You got a problem with it?  Go F yourself.  Because this is what's happening.  This is the future.  This is now.  Go listen to your buddy.  Go sign up.  Might be a bad day today because you're going to get a rerun because he's not even there.  You're either going to get a rerun or him talking for four hours how he got his old tapes back.  Right.  His old cassette tapes back.  Wonderful. 
[00:08:00]  You want to listen to old cassette tape?  I'll tell you what.  Dig through some boxes you have in your house.  You'll probably find maybe an old white snake tape or something that you used to play in your car.  Pop that in a tape player and see what it sounds like.  That's what that is going to sound like when he plays his old material.  Here's the deal.  It is so easy to do an FCC-compliant radio program.  It is so easy.  With adult-oriented conversation.  So if it's this easy to do an FCC-compliant radio show, you've got to wonder, did he lose his passion or was it that he just couldn't adapt? 
[00:08:30]  And he wasn't as great as he told his listeners for many, many years.  We're not going to sit here and tell you that, but just think about it yourself.  Make up your own mind.  All right.  That's enough of that.  Inbred pest, West Palm, you know, because we've got to explain things to West Palm.  Oh, right.  And I don't want to confuse people down there. 
[00:09:00]  The listeners, they don't need any explanation.  No.  They're getting the show.  They're getting the virus.  They're getting hooked.  But it's some of the people that may work for the radio station down there.  West Palm, Howard Stern is an old washed-up pack who, in recent years, has faded into obscurity.  See, also, lazy Jew.  Oh, Jesus.  Why did the anti-Semitic little lines got to be thrown into those insults?  I don't think his religion really matters.  I just read them. 
[00:09:30]  I read them as I seize them.  I'm just a reader, and I'm not even good at that.  That's good.  So it's going to be a hell of a day, I've got to tell you right now.  Yeah.  For once, I'm the happy one out of the three.  I'm happy.  I'm just, oh, God.  I walked in, and I saw Anthony, and I went, oh, my God.  Uh-oh.  Oh, my God.  Is this the year 2001?  It's the old Anthony last night.  I blame it on Elo.  I blame it on Elo, our boss from XM. 
[00:10:00]  I think he was trying to sabotage the CBS show.  I think he got really pissed off that the Flying Hollander brothers took us out to steak dinner a couple nights ago.  Yep.  And those guys, very responsible broadcasters, you know, they run the radio division here at CBS.  They took us out to a steak dinner nice and early, knowing, A, we can't control ourselves, B, you know, if we get out of there at a decent hour, there's a good chance we'll go to bed at a decent hour.  And we'll get home.  And we'll do some fine radio, which we did yesterday. 
[00:10:30]  And C, that I wouldn't be there to ruin it.  Oh, yeah, that's true.  That's another one.  Wait till we get to Jimmy.  Wait till we get to Jimmy.  And then Elo, I think he might have been a little pissed off at that.  So he invited us to this fine Derek Jeter fundraising thing last night here in New York City.  And I bailed at like 9.30, quarter to 10.  That's when things just got rolling.  And Anthony bailed at about 1 in the morning.  Yeah, it was like 1, a little hungover. 
[00:11:00]  But I don't give Elo that much credit where he, you know, had some grand scheme or grand plan.  Elo is just a lush.  Elo likes to drink when he's out.  And he likes company when he's drinking.  And we all hung out and did some of that drinking.  He's a bit lonely.  Yeah.  He gets lonely.  Gets a little lonely.  And he's, he's, uh, we were in the hotel that, uh, you know, he was staying in, having a few drinks. 
[00:11:30]  So, um, you know, he's fine.  He can just go upstairs anytime he wants.  I had to go out, get a cab, go back to my hotel.  Pain in the ass.  But, uh, yeah, didn't get to sleep.  Uh, had a, had a wake up.  I woke up a little late.  I came in a little later than usual today.  And, um, oh, it's the first time in a while I had to just take a couple of aspirin before I came to work.  It's like the old days. 
[00:12:00]  It's like the old days.  A little hungover today.  So Anthony's sitting there going, man, I gotta wake up.  I go, wake up?  You gotta, you gotta sleep before you're able to wake up.  Yeah, I really haven't slept yet.  You haven't really slept yet.  You haven't really slept yet.  Like the old days.  The day before the long weekend.  We're gonna take a nice long weekend.  Yeah, West Palm, we used to do afternoon drives and, uh, afternoon drive radio here in New York before we got fired.  And Anthony used to drink the entire show.  Used to drink the whole show.  Those were the days.  Now, you know, you drink at six in the morning.  They, uh, they call you what? 
[00:12:30]  An alcoholic.  Instead of just somebody who wants to start their fun a little early.  Hey, John, what's up?  Hello?  What's up, John?  Hello?  Yo, I've been listening to you guys.  You guys are all right.  You're all right.  But what's with the constant stern every day?  Hey, John, can I, can I answer that, please?  John, see, you gotta be honest with, uh, yourself and with us.  Do we talk about Howard every day?  I wanna know the answer.  Seriously, do we talk about him every day?  Yes, you do.  No, we don't, first of all.  That is such a lie. 
[00:13:00]  And secondly, did we bring it up?  Did we bring it up or did a caller, just like you, call up about Howard?  What are we supposed to do?  Not take the call like Howard does?  Hang up on it?  Not acknowledge it like Howard does?  We're not gonna allow you to change reality like he likes to do on his program and say  stuff like, that's all they do is talk about me.  First of all, we don't talk about him every day.  We barely talk about him at this point.  When we do, we rant for about five to ten minutes and then we move on.  And then we move on, which is what we were doing before you called. 
[00:13:30]  Right.  And then reference him again.  So now we gotta bring him up again because of your call?  We do five and a half hours of radio a day.  I guarantee that we do not talk about him every day.  And when we do, it's maybe five or ten minutes at a clip.  So, John, it says maybe if you stop talking about Stern, I would give you a chance.  Guess what, John?  I don't need you to give us a chance, okay?  I don't need you to give us a chance.  Goodbye.  Maybe that's how we should handle things now. 
[00:14:00]  People are, his fans are a little upset that all we do is talk about him.  Well, then stop calling.  Actually, we talked about this recently.  We said to ourselves off-air, we're like, you notice on Fridays, like, the Howard fans come out of the woodwork?  Yep.  We just, we were just saying this.  Because Howard doesn't work on Fridays.  And, you know, the reality is people like listening to a live program.  You know, the reality is when you do take a day off or a week off, you got your hardcore fans that'll check out the replays and stuff.  But in general... 
[00:14:30]  They've heard it already.  If you're kind of a talk show fan, you want to hear something live that is happening in the moment.  There's the revolution revolving the same material you've heard over and over again.  There you go.  Boy, that revolution.  Because honestly, I don't think we talked about Howard since, like, last Friday.  Of course not.  Because the same thing happened last Friday.  He is screwing over his fans so bad and eventually they'll wake up and realize that.  Believe me, we don't want to.  It's not in our best interest to give him the publicity. 
[00:15:00]  Today, we're talking to a lot more people than he is.  Deal with it.  Can't they just deal with it?  It's impossible.  But he's our hero.  He has to talk to the most people of anybody on radio, right?  Didn't they get, like, eight quadrillion subscribers because of him on Sirius?  I bet they did.  That's what he told me.  No.  He's listening to hundreds of thousands of people.  The reality is...  How many are listening to him?  Excuse me.  I've been drinking. 
[00:15:30]  That's how many listen to him.  You know, the reality is that less than 10% of his listeners in New York City and the New  York area went to satellite, and it's way less than 10%.  And the rest...  Way less than 10%.  Why they didn't go, and the reason?  They just didn't care.  And you know how embarrassing it is to call our show and defend him as he's out in the  Hamptons watching concrete being poured on his multi-million dollar summer home?  He doesn't give a crap about you.  Go out there and maybe lend a hand.  Put a few shovelfuls of concrete in the foundation. 
[00:16:00]  Maybe he'll know your name.  He doesn't give a crap.  He did his time, and now he's...  And God bless him.  Now he's taking a paycheck.  Took the huge last paycheck.  Something we all want.  I'm not going to lie to you.  Yeah, but to make it sound like he's still trying to make a revolution happen and change radio  again is such BS.  You've got to wake up and realize that.  His best days are behind him.  He even knows it.  Yeah.  He doesn't have the fight in him anymore.  We beat him up all the time, and he has nothing.  He has nothing. 
[00:16:30]  He actually tried to befriend Dice to have Dice go at it with us.  He has nothing.  That was a sad, sad moment.  And that was beyond sad.  You're right, Anthony.  Trying to relive the glory days.  They're long gone, people.  Sorry.  It's just the way things work out.  Hey, Howie.  I defended Cleck.  He doesn't care.  Next subject, Robin.  Pooh-hoo.  And it's driving him nuts that the ratings are coming in, and it's very early, but it's  looking like we're going to be just fine in morning radio. 
[00:17:00]  We're going to be just fine.  The stations that we're on, that he was on, are going to do just fine.  They're not going to fall apart.  They're not going to self-destruct because he left like he likes to tell all his fans.  It's just not going to happen.  And the reality is he was never a king of all media.  He wasn't even close to being the king of all media.  But people want to call up and defend him or just bash us.  That's why the subject gets brought up. 
[00:17:30]  See, the king of all media is someone that writes a lot of books, does a lot of movies,  has a TV show on something that, you know, where a lot of people are going to check it  out.  Not on a cable outlet.  Pay-per-view.  You can't call yourself the king of all media if you haven't done anything in over 10 years  as far as writing books and trying to make a movie.  Not stupid.  There was a point where the guy was the greatest on the air. 
[00:18:00]  He was the greatest radio personality on the air at a certain time in his career where you  could not miss a show.  There was that time.  Don't call up and give these the baba booey like it's 19 friggin' 90.  Just, it's so irrelevant.  And it makes whoever's doing it seem so lost in the past.  I'm going to latch on to that old glory.  Oh, it's sad, you idiot. 
[00:18:30]  All right, let's move on.  But unfortunately, this is going to happen every Friday because he doesn't work Fridays.  Yeah, it doesn't work Friday.  And the whole month of August is going to be a complete nightmare.  Stay tuned the month of August when all of Howard's listeners come over here to try it  out.  We don't really mind because a few of them, believe it or not, a few of them are going  to keep listening to this show.  It just happens.  The law averages, people.  We're sorry.  That's right.  They won't go back.  August is going to be a nightmare.  He hasn't even really told his listeners yet that that's what's going to happen. 
[00:19:00]  No.  That's why he keeps talking about his old tapes because he's hoping he gets enough interest  in his old tapes.  And then he's going to say something like, you know, all these old tapes haven't been  playing in so long.  I think it's worth me stepping aside for a month so you guys get to hear the old shows  unedited.  Blah, blah, blah.  What, do you got to edit the wife out of all of them?  Is that part of the plan?  What, do you got to edit Jackie out of them?  What are you going to do?  Have actors play their parts?  Re-tape them again?  All right. 
[00:19:30]  Why don't we take a break?  That's it for the Howie crap.  Yeah, enough.  He's on the Hamptons sleeping in as we still, you know, do radio for people.  God, that must be nice.  I want the big paycheck.  And, like, he's just looking at retirement.  Like, this is the last thing.  Do not look for him to re-sign anything.  If you're making that kind of cash for a five-year deal, when that is over, you are so gone  and so retired, it's over. 
[00:20:00]  Well, after the five years, he's going to be 60 years old.  Yeah.  Oh, that'll be over.  That'll be tough.  Yeah.  It's going to be tough to take on the 60-year-old man.  It's easy now.  It's going to be a lot easier when he's 60.  Hey, we got to take a break.  Jimmy, you all right?  Yeah.  Yeah, of course.  We're going to get into what happened yesterday at the Derek Jeter fundraiser.  Food?  All right this morning?  No.  Yeah, the food's fine.  Oh, good.  Okay.  Oatmeal's finally got some kind of liquid in it. 
[00:20:30]  I was worried about you.  We'll talk about it next.  Yeah.  We'll talk about it next.  I hate life.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Opie Anthony's Dance Party Weekend.

[00:22:00]  There's a lot of weird tension in the room right now.  There are people that are tired and hungover.  There are people like Jimmy that is just completely annoyed.  What's going on with the guests?  Do you have some people coming up or something and they're having a problem downstairs?  Oh, no, no.  My sister and my nephew are going to come to watch.  And I just gave Steve their names.  And Steve goes, well, security likes to have it 24 hours in advance.  Yeah, does security. 
[00:22:30]  How do you know?  How about this?  You're not getting a 24 hours in advance.  Scatman Crothers down there right now.  You're going to do your job and sign them in, stupid.  And shouldn't he know?  I hate that guy downstairs right now.  He's the same guy.  When I came in here, I was late one morning.  I've only been late once since we've been on CBS.  And I'm running late.  And I'm coming to the other.  He goes, yo, come here for a second.  I'm like, I'm running late.  I got to be out of the air.  He's like, oh, no, come here.  And he gives me a bunch of newspapers.  I'm not an intern, stupid.  Yeah.  And I snapped at him.  And now he won't say hi to me. 
[00:23:00]  So why don't you die?  I'm with Jimmy.  I refuse to say hi to those guys downstairs.  The one guy that works here.  They think they're so damn important.  Who was here yesterday.  He's an older guy.  Yeah.  And the whole lobby smells like cologne when he's in there.  He's a nice dude.  Yeah.  He's a friendly guy.  I like him.  Doc, did you ever know when guests are going to show up before 24 hours?  Did you ever know that, Doc?  That's called the shine.  Some people have the shine.  My grandmother and me used to have whole conversations about guests and when they were going to show up and what time it was going to be. 
[00:23:30]  My mom said, I'm not supposed to let guests up unless I have a 24-hour in advance notice.  When do you think maybe we should get security at guest list?  Jimmy's going to be waiting with an axe to just embed it in his chest.  And Jimmy's annoyed to begin with.  I'm going to follow you. 
[00:24:00]  But before we get to Jimmy and the Derek Jeter thing from last night, the person that invited us to the Derek Jeter thing last night is sitting on the couch over there.  And he's completely out of it, too.  Elo.  Elo, who's the main guy at XM Satellite Radio.  And we're the biggest show on XM Satellite Radio.  He casually comes in, looks at Anthony and goes, hey, so what time did we leave the bar last night?  I think it was one-ish.  And I go to Elo.  I'm like, Elo, you are the top guy. 
[00:24:30]  And you're just casually asking the biggest part of your biggest show, what time you guys left the bar.  Knowing that he has to get up to do a show for you in XM Satellite Radio.  You never think about it at the time.  It's always so much fun.  When you're just kind of hanging out.  Didn't want to do it.  Drinking.  And the time flies, too.  Like that.  That's why I asked the question.  What time did we leave?  And then, you know, I looked at my watch and went, oh, boy, I think it's time to go.  Because let me tell you something. 
[00:25:00]  I was the voice of responsibility, even though I did get out of there late.  Believe it or not.  Because there was some little chatter at the table going on that we were going to leave that establishment and head down to scores.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  It was, we were real close to going.  I had a car.  Yeah.  I had a car all set up.  You're the one that's supposed to say, don't you have a show to do tomorrow?  You don't actually tell Anthony to go home.  You can't tell a grown man to go home. 
[00:25:30]  But shouldn't you have at least gave him a hint that maybe he should go home at a decent hour?  I was testing Anthony's rally ability.  Yeah.  That was it.  Great.  I knew as long as I had a few hours sleep, I could come in, pull it off.  The better half was there.  So I figured if things got really crazy, she would have went, took you away.  Yeah.  See?  Everyone, there was a plan.  A grand plan.  I do notice, Eric, wearing the same suit you were wearing last night.  This is the whipped cream from the dessert, the little dessert with cream on his sleeve. 
[00:26:00]  He's just a wreck.  Vomit cake, Donut County.  Get it together, man.  Need an intervention with you.  My man town suit.  Nice.  You're in charge over there at XM.  So we should get into this with the Derek Jeter.  What was it called?  The Turn 2 Foundation 10th Anniversary Dinner.  Yeah, it was 10th anniversary.  He started it in his rookie year.  Back in 96. 
[00:26:30]  And a lot of people were there.  A lot of Yankees.  Some other people.  Celebrities and whatnot.  Joe Buck hosted.  Joe Buck hosted.  He was pretty funny, actually.  Does a good job as a host.  He was pretty funny.  He was pretty funny.  Yeah, very natural.  And I guess XM bought a table and Eric Logan decided to bring us.  Yep.  The whole clue.  Everybody.  And some dudes for marketing.  Yep.  Hojo.  Hojo.  Yep.  Had a good time.  I went just to be part of the event. 
[00:27:00]  That's all.  Just to hang out.  See what it's all about.  We don't go to many of these things.  That's for sure.  We're not the, you know, go to these star-studded extravaganzas where they bring out the little  plates with the appetizer thing all stacked up 10 feet high.  And then the dinner comes out and, you know, it's a hoity-toity event is what I like to  call it.  Hoity-toity.  Yeah.  I was in my suit and tie and, um, and then, and then we have Jimmy Norton. 
[00:27:30]  Well, you came late.  Yeah.  I got there a little late.  Ilo met me at the bar area and Jimmy was already, Jimmy was already inside and Ilo's like, I  have, I could only imagine what he's doing in there.  I have to get back in there immediately.  I'm like, what's going on?  And Ilo's like, he's in rare form, right, right out of the, right out of the box.  Jimmy goes to the, these things on a mission.  He's on a mission.  It has nothing to do with enjoying yourself and, and, uh, just having some nice food. 
[00:28:00]  It all takes a back seat to the mission at hand.  And that mission is to either get photographs with famous people that he does not yet have  photographs with and, or to get those photographs signed by the person.  On some occasions, yes.  Not always.  A lot of times I don't need to get the picture signed.  No.  People are, first of all, I got to thank, um, Eric, obviously, uh, Ilo and, uh, and Hojo, 
[00:28:30]  right?  Hojo.  Hojo is amazing.  Everyone has an O name, by the way.  Yeah.  XM.  I am mandatory.  Well, can I, Peter has one too.  Dick O.  Okay.  The first, the first, first of many slurs been thrown out.  First of many.  I got to explain too, when, uh, Jimmy goes to these things with his camera and stuff, even  though they, they tell you that you can't bring a camera and they don't want you taking  photos.  He's got his.  Uh, he's got his, which is fine.  I mean, you know, you can try to work around the rules.  I just was like, well, I still don't have a camera cause I lost mine at the comedy cellar. 
[00:29:00]  And I saw some flashes going off from people's cameras.  So obviously it was being done.  He was using a cell phone.  Yeah.  But he also sets it up where he has to have an assistant.  Yeah.  I used to be the assistant, but I can't handle it anymore.  Too much pressure.  Right.  A lot of people around here have been the Jim Norton, uh, picture taking assistant.  I gave up after the Metallica, uh, ordeal where we were backstage for an hour and a half,  me and Bill Burr and Jimmy and, and, and Bill and I are getting bored and laughing a little 
[00:29:30]  too much backstage.  He's like, they're going to throw us out.  Oh, they're going to throw us out before I get my pictures.  That was the last day I was, I was, uh, Jimmy's assistant, even though even at that event,  I bailed and I think Bill ended up getting the pictures for you.  So Roland is the new date, the new, uh, picture taking guy for Jim Norton.  Cause I mean, Jimmy, you know, he's not going to just hand his camera off to anyone cause  that person could screw up the shot.  He gives you a speech the whole time.  Look, look, if Derek Jeter comes up, what I'm going to do is I'm going to give you the 
[00:30:00]  camera.  I'm going to check it.  I'm going to check it about a hundred times, make sure it's set and make sure, you know,  we're in focus.  And he explains the whole thing.  Yeah.  The whole thing.  You got one shot.  One shot.  Don't you screw it up.  You have to be prepared.  It gets to the point though, if you're Jimmy's assistant in these situations, you're literally shaking  as you take the picture, cause you know, you only have one shot and you know, all hell's  going to break loose if you don't do it right.  Cause at one time, hold on.  Cause now I'm getting into this at Ozfest in Philly. 
[00:30:30]  I was his assistant.  I was going around getting the pictures, right?  Yeah.  And I got a picture of Jimmy and Rob Zombie, but it was in front of a glass panel.  It was a perfect shot.  I got to tell you, but the flash from the camera was in the middle of them, but it didn't  take away from, I swear it didn't take away from anything, but it was distracting  to look at the big white flash in the window.  And he was bummed out.  He was bummed out by a little flash that was literally like, you know, halfway down their  body.  So it was nowhere near their faces.  You could still see their bodies perfectly. 
[00:31:00]  He's like, oh, look at this.  Later got taken out.  But then you, I wasn't angry.  I was just like, ah, man, you think this is still cool?  I wasn't mad.  Like you were kind of, you were bummed.  A little bummed, but I mean.  But then you fixed it in a, in a post, uh, post-production.  And I'll tell you one thing, two things actually.  One, I know I'm crazy about it.  That's part of my OCD.  Yeah.  But you, you, a couple of times, uh, at that Metallica thing, Ben, who never asked for  pictures, when Lars came over and was introduced to me by Brewer, Ben's like, oh, could you  get me one?  It's Lars.  He understood at that moment.  And it wasn't at that moment. 
[00:31:30]  We were, we're backstage forever.  And you drove.  We had no choice.  And, um.  We had no choice.  When you, when you, when you and I went to XM to watch Robert Plant do it, you wanted  a picture.  Oh, absolutely.  There are certain, I'll tell you something.  You're right.  But that's normal stuff.  And there's certain times, yes, you do want to take a picture, but with you, it's, it  doesn't matter.  It's with everybody.  That's the point I'm trying to make.  You saw it.  The plant thing though.  Some guys are really hard to get, really hard to get.  Plant's one of them.  And we both got them because it was set up right.  I know it's annoying, but sometimes you got to do it. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  And it helped me with Sabbath.  All those years of preparation got me the Sabbath picture.  Hold on.  The perfect picture.  Hold on.  In all fairness, we, we, you and I got to see Robert Plant.  It was ours confidential.  Yeah.  It was, it was me and Jimmy literally in front of Robert Plant.  My feet away.  As he's singing, uh, like he's singing in front of girls.  It was a little strange.  Warming up.  He was warming up.  He was doing his sound check and it was just Jimmy and I in the front row like, like  idiots with, with Robert Plant and this huge Robert Plant package.  Did it look like he was smuggling a grapefruit? 
[00:32:30]  And we're like, uh, here's the difference though.  The whole time we were down there for the Robert Plant thing, all it was, all you thought  about was the picture.  Yes.  To me, it was like, wow, this is cool.  Robert Plant.  Hopefully, maybe I'll get a picture.  But you were talking to Lee Abrams and everybody else down there over and over again, where,  where it got back to Elon and everybody else that you were just a complete, uh, nuisance.  Who cares?  But that's, that's what I'm, but that's what I'm, but that's what I'm getting at.  Like the Dirk Jeter thing yesterday, if I got a few pictures here and there, yeah, that  would have been cool.  Spike Lee was there. 
[00:33:00]  I would have liked a picture with Spike Lee.  Sure.  Um, but it didn't happen and I didn't really try.  Well, that's what I do.  But with you, it's all about pictures.  And, and then the actual having fun part is, is that's what's fun to me.  I don't, I don't like to watch a bunch of ballplayers go, uh, you know, did you hit  40 home runs?  Wasn't a lot of fun that year.  That's not fun for me.  Going to the authorized party is not fun for me.  I have nothing in common with them.  I honest to God.  But isn't it fun just to be part of the experience?  See, it's fun for me to be part of the experience. 
[00:33:30]  I don't, I don't drink.  But it seems that I don't drink.  I don't fit in with them.  None of them know.  I'm not even talking about the drinking part of it.  Just being at the Entourage premiere, that would have been cool to me.  But it seems like the, the photo part isn't fun for you either.  That is fun for me.  Because it's too much pressure.  So that, that turns out to be not fun for you.  When things are set up, and once in a while you can, and once in a while most times you  can't, when I know I'm going to get it and things are cool, here's the thing that's  key in life.  As a performer, you want backstage access. 
[00:34:00]  Right.  Because you're used to having it at your own shows.  When that's set up, everything's cool.  A lot of times you can't because it's just not the nature of the event.  And that's understandable, but that to me, then it doesn't become about the whole,  the photo thing.  Cause you know that that's happening.  That's a cool part.  But when you got to sneak in there as a fan and you got to work for it, well, I've learned  through trial and error how to do it.  It's a high, it's fun to do.  I like doing it.  It's a pain in the ass sometimes, but look, that's why I have the collection.  I have people like, dude, you have a lot of voters.  I have an updated eat a bullet.  Oh, eat a bullet.com. 
[00:34:30]  Don't dump out.  There's no porn on my site.  Eat a bullet.com is my website.  I haven't updated it in probably a year and a half with photos.  And I probably know it's a hundred and something pictures.  And when you do, it's going to be interesting to look at.  I like doing it.  So you brought a camera, you brought photos to be signed, you brought a couple different  Sharpies just in case one's not working right.  What else?  Two photos.  I have a photo with Jeter, which I got at XM.  And again, let me, before I start, thank Eric and thank Hojo. 
[00:35:00]  Eric invited us to this dinner and did everything.  XM was great.  I mean, got us in, got me the access.  And I get there and Hojo hands me, he goes, dude, I hooked you up.  He hands me a signed Jeter picture.  Yeah.  And a signed Jeter ball.  Nice.  Amazing.  We all got that.  It was amazing.  Yeah.  And that made me very happy.  I think he had to pay for that.  He was the only one who had made it, but I think he did.  I think he had to pay for that because they were selling them for the charity, which is  fine.  So if he did.  They got him in his house last night.  He went to his house and got him in his house after the game yesterday afternoon or two days 
[00:35:30]  ago.  Well, that was absolutely fantastic.  And it wasn't even about that.  Yeah, it's Friday.  It was amazing.  I just want to let you know.  I'm an idiot.  So what I brought was this.  I have a photo with Joe Dora.  It's still Thursday for you.  Which I got in 97.  And I have one photo with Jeter, which I got at XM actually in January because he's XM  baseball's face.  Right.  Which Stephanie tried to kick me out of the dressing room and she did kick me out of the dressing  room.  And then somebody else got me the picture.  I think Lee got me the picture.  Oh, boy.  Or was it Jamie?  No, no.  That's in January.  That wasn't a good day either.  Why would it be?  Somebody that works for the company throwing on air talent out of the room because I understand 
[00:36:00]  that he's Jeter, but you know what?  I do kind of work for you and I do kind of work for you in a visible capacity.  I know you hate me, but could you fake it?  Yeah, we saw some research yesterday.  You better start treating us nice.  I mean, really.  Elo and Hojo, I mean, sincerely.  It was, I mean, it was very, very cool that you got to say it and you didn't have to do  that.  It's genuinely appreciated.  Right.  I'm not just saying that because it's the right thing to say.  So I hate the Yankees.  Well, I mean, listen to me. 
[00:36:30]  They're your favorite team though, Jimmy.  I hate this team now.  But they're your favorite team.  I'm not even kidding.  Not even if the Yankees are the team.  Hey, he hates the individual members that make up the Yankees.  All of them.  All of them.  None of them are nice.  Please, when we get back from our long weekend, come in here with the Boston Red Sox cap.  I absolutely would love to see Boston smash their faces.  You know what?  I'll say this.  Ortiz, Ben interviewed him.  He said he was in a rush, but he was a nice guy. 
[00:37:00]  I've heard so much about how these guys are nice guys.  They're so friendly.  They're not friendly.  What an arrogant group of asses this whole organization is.  Can I tell you?  I can't believe I am saying this.  Can I tell you what I saw when I got to our table?  All right.  Jimmy, completely miserable.  The event started 10 minutes, only 10 minutes in.  Roland looked like he was like an abused wife.  He was a wreck. 
[00:37:30]  I know.  Roland was sweating so bad, and he looked like he was going to have a nervous breakdown.  His suit was all in a disarray.  His hair was all screwed up.  I remember it.  And he was all shaking.  Roland's whole job was to be Jimmy's assistant.  For 10 minutes.  As far as trying to get pictures taken.  Roland.  See, look.  He's smiling now.  He's freshly showered.  He's relaxed.  Roland sweats because there's some kind of a weird foreign thing running through his veins.  Roland sweats in Antarctica.  He can't help on the shelf.  And he's good at this, and he's comfortable in these situations. 
[00:38:00]  Roland was not nervous.  He didn't care.  But I did mess up on one picture.  The Posada.  That wasn't probably my fault, though.  Posada.  What went through your head when you realized you messed up the picture?  I didn't blame him.  I was like, oh, Jesus.  I think I messed up.  Jimmy ran down to get Jorge.  Jorge looked so annoyed at me.  That was an idiot that couldn't take a picture.  But I wasn't mad.  He was.  But he wasn't nervous about it.  He knew what he was.  He's been.  We got to get through the got him, got him, need him, got him, need him, need him, got him list that Jimmy got last night.  All right.  We will.  So I get to the table. 
[00:38:30]  Roland is just a nervous wreck.  Jimmy is miserable.  Do you know how he does Frank the Frowner?  Yeah.  Oh, it was for real.  There was no smiles to be had yesterday.  And then all I hear him is whispering under his breath, I hate my life, and I should just kill myself.  Because I'm not a player.  And I've always known I'm not a player.  I mean, like, I'm not a force in this business.  He's like, you're on the road to Playerville.  I'm an unrecognizable nothing.  Wait, Anthony, I memorized all of them.  Who am I kidding?  I'm nobody. 
[00:39:00]  I just started thinking I might be somebody.  I obviously am nobody.  I'm going nowhere in this business.  I hate my life.  I hate myself.  I should just kill myself.  When you saw me, here's what happened.  I brought my sign with Jeter, a picture with Jeter, and a picture with Tori.  They're selling things here for charity.  They don't want you to bring in baseballs and Yankee calendars to get signed.  It's about a charity.  And half of these scumbag memorabilia people ask you to sign things.  They sell them on eBay.  Or they go rip people off with them. 
[00:39:30]  And I understand the players don't want to be bothered.  They don't want to be signing that kind of crap.  Understandable.  This was a photo of me and him.  So I walk down.  I walk in.  Jeter is actually taking pictures for charity and for money.  All the money goes to charity.  I have a picture with him.  I said, let me see if I can get him to sign it.  He walks out.  The security is going, I'll get back, I'll get back, I'll get back, I'll get back, I'll  get back, I'll get back.  Let it be known Jimmy went early.  Because Jimmy knows how to get pictures done, by the way.  He's the expert. 
[00:40:00]  So like the average schmo would get there when they tell you to get there.  He gets there a little early knowing that they're going to be arriving themselves.  Instinctively, I know you have to do this.  So I have the marker out.  And my picture, I'm like, let me just ask him when it comes out.  So I'm holding it out.  It couldn't have been easier.  He walks up.  And I'm like, could you sign this picture of us?  And he goes, sorry, buddy, I got to do an interview.  And he pats me on the shoulder.  I'm annoyed, but I understand.  Okay, you got to do it.  But the first time I met Ozzy, he goes, I said, hey, man, could you sign these?  I can't, man.  I got this TV thing. 
[00:40:30]  And he walked by me.  And then when I met him 15 minutes later, I go, could you sign this?  He goes, sure, man.  You know why?  Because Ozzy is not a liar.  He's real.  He's not a phony.  He's not a phony.  That's why.  Yeah.  And then now, what happened after that?  Well, 30 seconds after this, some broad calls him over.  And of course, he stops to talk to the broad.  Because they're the ones that are buying your jerseys, right?  Stupid.  The chicks.  Well, the chicks do buy the pink Yankees. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, I know they do.  They're the ones that knew who you were when you were still in AAA ball.  Those are the ones that liked you when you were a rookie.  Those are the ones that know that you're number two.  Jackass.  Those are the ones.  Those are the ones.  The chicks.  They say he's got nice buns.  They don't know if it's you or Tino from the back, stupid.  So anyway, he walks over to talk to these broads.  And then, mister, I'm in a rush for an interview.  They hustle him in the back for another picture with chicks. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, boy.  Wow.  Thought you had an interview to do.  Oh, I get it.  I'm just a jerk off standing there waiting for a picture to be signed.  Yeah.  I get it.  So that's why I was annoyed when you saw me.  Yeah.  That's why.  Because it was phony.  And I knew it was phony.  And I saw it in his face.  Look, I am maybe one one thousandth the fame he is.  But I have stood and signed four or five hundred autographs after a theater show.  So I've had those occasions where it's been annoying and I've had to sign. 
[00:42:00]  Never have I turned down a fan with a picture of them.  I've never turned down a fan to begin with.  Never with a picture of me in that person.  You know it's not going anywhere.  Okay, he didn't want to sign it.  And Roland, you saw it.  He didn't want to do it.  It wasn't I'm in a rush.  There's a camera.  I got to go.  It was he didn't want to do it.  So I go back to the table.  And believe me, there's more.  And that's why I was annoyed when you first saw me.  And I know a lot of the fans are going to kill me today. 
[00:42:30]  He's complaining.  I don't care.  No, this is a great rant.  This was all that.  This was what made the event so interesting.  I came in, I guess, about this time.  I was late.  You were way late.  I was way late.  You missed most of the action with him.  Because I was livid myself.  You missed.  Downpour.  Trying to get a cab in New York City.  With Elo calling like every 15 minutes or so.  Where are you?  Hey, where are you?  Just sitting behind a savage trying to get down a Broadway like half a mile. 
[00:43:00]  Not even.  And it took at least 45 minutes to get maybe 10 blocks because of the rain and the pedestrians and just people.  Oh, so I finally got there.  And when I sat down, I looked over at Ope, Ope turned around, smiled.  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  Jimmy was sitting there like hunched over, mumbling to himself. 
[00:43:30]  I don't think I've ever had more fun hanging out with Jimmy, by the way, because he was so miserable.  I get into that like you wouldn't believe.  When you saw me, the first time Ope saw me, it was right after that happened.  And Roland saw too.  Roland understands what I'm talking about.  The difference between, I'm not an idiot.  I understand what the hell, I don't know how much XM paid for this table.  It was $20,000.  Okay, so you know that me being there, there was a $20,000 investment that I was involved with somehow.  It was the generosity of XM.  But you know that I was there for some reason. 
[00:44:00]  And it was not, could you sign this ball, DJ?  It was a picture of you and me.  And you know what?  When the first time I met him at XM, I didn't care for him that much.  He took the picture with me.  He didn't want to.  I believe I've signed enough autographs.  Sorry I don't have 34 Ds, stupid.  I just have B cups.  Can we take a break and then we'll get into part two?  Yes, because I hate the rest of the team too.  We'll get into...  None of you are nice guys.  One of you is a nice guy.  Oh, why? 
[00:44:30]  One of you.  Find out who.  Anthony, this is what you missed just before you arrived.  Jimmy is livid, right?  But all of a sudden, Jim Larritz, I always say his name wrong, Larritz, Larritz.  Just call him phony number 30.  Jim Larritz, who was on our show and gave us an amazing interview and was admitting to popping pills and all that.  How long did we hang out with him for?  Three hours?  We must have hung out with him a half hour here and then another hour, hour and a half at XM.  Two hours.  Let's call it two hours.  Easy, okay? 
[00:45:00]  This is the tease.  So, Jimmy is livid, but now he's trying to make a comeback.  He's trying to rally.  He sees Jim Larritz at the table next to us.  He goes, oh, Jim, he was on our show recently.  Yeah, there's an in.  He gets up to say hi to Jim Larritz and we'll tell you what happened next.  Oh, boy.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  It's the O.B. and Anthony show.  You're home for good, clean, wholesome family entertainment.  F***.  Wow.  F***. 
[00:45:30]  F***.  That is such a long way to go just to say f***.  Oh, yeah, f***.  Oh, yeah, f***.  Oh, yeah, f***.  Oh, yeah, f***.  Oh, yeah, f***.  Oh, it's the, uh, it's the O.B. 
[00:46:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  The O.B. and Anthony show.  Go!  It's truly a shame we just had to play commercials.  He's still going.  It's the O.B. and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  So we should get right back into this.  We're at the Dirk Jeter thing last night.  Uh, what have we learned so far?  Uh, Dirk Jeter dissed him as far as taking a picture.  By purpose.  Or having the picture that Jimmy brought with him signed. 
[00:46:30]  Gave an excuse.  About, uh, he had something to do.  Walked away.  And then proceeded to, uh, take some pictures with some young ladies.  Yeah, yeah.  I was at the XM table.  XM, uh, paid $20,000 for the event.  Yeah.  I arrived all happy.  And I got even happier when I saw how miserable Jimmy was.  You're terrible.  Usually when someone is miserable, it brings you down.  Yeah.  I was giggling like a little girl.  I gotta be honest with ya.  When he was saying how he, he's a nobody and he hates his life and he should just kill himself. 
[00:47:00]  It made me very, very happy.  Because when, again, when he wouldn't sign the picture, I, I, I was cool with it.  Like, all right, whatever, man.  He's gotta go do a, uh, a press junket.  But then when he stopped and talked to the chick, he could have signed eight pictures.  And then he went back into the room and took pictures with two chicks.  Yeah.  Sorry, I didn't realize that it was chicks that want to cut their wrists when the Yankees  lost in 2001.  Sorry, I didn't realize it was a bunch of chicks that liked you when you were a rookie. 
[00:47:30]  You idiot.  You typical ass of an athlete.  Dude, I hate athletes.  Hate them.  You're a bunch of dummies.  They are, they're dumb jocks.  And Layers, you mentioned Layers before.  Right.  So, yeah, let's get right into it.  I gotta know what happened now.  Let's get to him.  Because I thought we had a relationship with the guy.  So did I.  So, yeah.  So, Jimmy is trying to calm down and get it together.  Because he knows it's still early on, so maybe some things could possibly happen.  Because he's always thinking, maybe I could salvage this night, right? 
[00:48:00]  And so then Jim Leritz is the right, he's standing right behind Elo, basically, where  he was sitting.  He was right there.  We just had him on the show.  So, I go, Jimmy, Jim Leritz.  And he's like, oh, oh, wow.  You know, I think you even said he knows us.  Yeah, he did the show.  Cool, you know?  So, he gets up like, this is going to be his rallying point.  This is going to rally him to get him back into an okay place where he can try to focus  to get more pictures and maybe the Derek Jeter picture sign.  Well, you just feel like not so much a piece of garbage.  So, say hi to one of the Yankees and they know me. 
[00:48:30]  So, Jimmy jumps up.  I just sat down because I already knew how this was going to play out.  And I swear, that's the only reason I didn't get up.  Because I just know.  And I think you knew in the back of my head.  I did.  In the back of my head, I did because I know that they're all phonies.  I'll say one thing about comics.  Basically, in most cases, what you see is what you get.  Yeah.  That guy you see a month from now or two weeks from now is going to say hello to you again.  So, I tap Larry Rich on the thing with my stupid, typical non-man tap. 
[00:49:00]  Little faggot fingers.  And he turns and he looks.  I go, hey, Jim.  And he said hello.  He goes, hey, man.  That was exactly the tone.  Hey, man.  And he shook my hand.  And I've shaken a lot of hands in my life.  Yeah.  It was the absolute look of, I know I've seen you.  I don't know where.  I don't care where.  Turn back around.  There was not one ounce of recognition that we had spent two hours together talking and laughing. 
[00:49:30]  I'm glad your wife took your ring, stupid.  What do you think of them apples?  Them apples.  What else did she take?  Your memory of people you hung out with?  Phony athlete.  All of them.  I hate their guts.  But he walked down the street with us.  He walked in the walkover with us.  Yeah.  He said walkover.  I saw Larry Rich again by the bathroom an hour later.  It was so awful.  And look, let me cut anybody off at the pass.  It's a big event.  He's excited.  There's other Yankees there. 
[00:50:00]  I don't expect him to throw his arms around me.  My God, Jim Dorton.  I've thought of nothing but you.  I didn't even care if he remembered my name.  A handshake.  Hey, man.  How are you?  A genuine half a second hello.  Yeah.  All I was after.  I didn't have a picture to be signed.  It was honest to God.  I'll call myself out when I'm being a piece of garbage.  This was a genuine hello was all I wanted.  Nothing.  No.  I saw him in the bathroom like outside the bathroom because this was the beauty.  I'm in the bathroom.  Yogi Berra's in the bathroom. 
[00:50:30]  I'm like, oh, my God.  They got to use the same bathroom the rest of us do.  So I go in.  I grab sweaty, far-headed Roland.  I drag him out.  I'm like, dude, they're all going to the bathroom.  He was a wreck at this point.  He can't even keep his shirt tucked in.  He's so nervous.  I saw Learich an hour later.  I go, hey, man.  I said, hi, again.  He goes, hey.  And it was such an awful hello.  I go, do you remember me?  And he goes, yeah, how are you?  Oh, he didn't.  He did, but he just didn't give a crap.  He didn't care.  That was why I hate him today. 
[00:51:00]  Well, he's not a fag.  Dude, I don't care.  Not that he wouldn't care.  The common decency, the common courtesy, because he did have a good time on the air.  And we treated him great.  And we're celebrities just like him.  No, exactly not.  And I understand that.  I understand that.  I'm very realistic about that.  I don't expect him to throw his arms around me.  Man, this is right up there with the 96 three-run homer.  I don't expect that.  He only hit one of the greatest homers in Yankee history.  They're all dicks.  The whole team is dicks. 
[00:51:30]  I can't believe I hate the Yankees.  Go Sox, right?  Go Sox.  Go Sox, right?  Dude, I am heartbroken.  I can't believe I hate that.  My Mets are going to kick your Sox ass.  I can't believe it.  Okay, so I walk out.  Although they didn't do too well.  I see Ron Guidry, the Gator.  Oh, my God.  18 strikeouts against California Angels, over 78.  Dude, one of my childhood idols.  Any girl would know these stats, by the way.  Any chick would know these.  Right.  You stupid athletes. 
[00:52:00]  You jackasses.  So, again, I say, and he took a picture with me.  I said, hey, Gator, I'm like, hey, man, can I get a quick shot?  Camera's set up, because I know.  Security is with these guys when they come out.  You've got to have your camera guy shaking in his boots, so it's all set up, ready to go.  And it's a respect thing.  I'm not going to fish through a camera while this guy stands here at a big, I know it's got to be ready and done.  That's what turns them off to pictures, by the way, are these idiots that don't know how to get it done. 
[00:52:30]  These dumb guys, and I've been through this, not like you have, Derek, but I've been through it enough,  where some idiot with his stupid fat broad has a camera phone.  It's a one.  I'm dialing 911.  It's send, whore.  Save it.  I swear to God, dude, camera phones, I'm going to smash them against your teeth.  They have ruined it for everybody.  To take pictures with you with a camera phone.  I'm going to bite your phone in your girlfriend's face.  Big, dopey, pixelated, nothing, dark, grainy picture. 
[00:53:00]  Can I jump in for one second?  I can get it.  Jump in for one second.  Nelson from Jersey, table at the Dirk Jeter event, $20,000, digital camera, $400,000, Sharpies, $3,000,  Jimmy losing his mind over being a nobody, priceless.  Of course.  Guidry took the picture because I was prepared.  It's nice.  But he wasn't nice.  Do you understand?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  He wasn't rude.  I thought this was a good one.  No.  None of them are good except one. 
[00:53:30]  But you got the picture.  They were douche after douche after douche.  A bunch of entitled douches.  I hate this team.  And I loved the Yankees.  Of course you did.  Loved them.  And my job is to observe.  We all know that.  So another observation, they're starting to come back to me now that we're all waking up.  So we're at the table.  Now the Jim Lerner thing happens.  He is just miserable.  He comes back.  And I'm just like, I can't get enough of Jimmy miserable. 
[00:54:00]  And then all of a sudden, I'm like, Jimmy, I'm not sure if I said this, but it was very  apparent that some people were sneaking.  See, the banquet room, we were in the middle, a bunch of tables.  The front of the room was where all the athletes were sitting with their wives and friends and  family and stuff.  But it looked like we were all in the same room, but we really weren't.  I said to Jimmy, I think, if not, correct me.  I'm like, Jimmy, people are sneaking to the front of the room to get pictures before the  event starts.  So I saw it. 
[00:54:30]  I saw that.  So all of a sudden, all of a sudden, roll it, roll it, roll it.  Up, up, roll it up.  Poor Roland, man.  The sweats is dripping off his forehead.  What?  What?  So Roland's up again as his assistant to get the picture done.  And they start walking to the front of the room.  I look at Elo and Lindsay, and I'm like, oh, boy, this ain't going to be good.  Well, they got cut off at the pass.  Security is in every little table aisle.  Oh, no.  They have a big security guard.  So you can't go where the gods are sitting. 
[00:55:00]  20,000 a table.  You can't mingle with the gods.  You know, the guys that are taller than you and treat you like garbage in high school with  the jocks.  You can't mingle with the gods because they're going to eat better food than we're getting,  I'm sure.  But, you know, I can almost understand that.  Because half of these mooks would walk up with a ball while a guy is eating, because  you're saying this, and get with gravy on.  I can understand them wanting some privacy from their families.  It was annoying, but I can understand that.  Again, I am not unrealistic. 
[00:55:30]  I'm not a dummy.  I understand these guys are bothered all the time.  Guidry, back to Guidry, took the picture, didn't want to.  The most insincere, yeah, thank you.  Yeah, beat it, stupid.  You haven't thrown a pitch in 20 years.  You're lucky I'm saying hello to you.  I just shot an HBO special.  Why don't you die?  He took the picture, but you could tell.  He wanted nothing to do with it.  What did the picture come out like?  Did he look like he doesn't want to be there?  No, of course not.  But they all know when to put their teeth on.  But, Jimmy.  They all know when to smile.  But, Jimmy, how does this play on your head? 
[00:56:00]  Do you want, like, an exchange of numbers?  Nope.  And you fast forward, and there you are having lunch.  Who would run Guidry?  Absolutely not.  Just a thank you from one human being to another.  I've met enough fans.  I've met enough fans where I know the difference between an annoying fan and a guy just getting a quick shot.  Now, I've got to get into your head a little bit.  Is that Guidry picture now tainted to you?  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  I got the picture.  He did take it.  Whatever.  I'm just saying, when you see it as a whole picture with all of these guys, you just realize they're dicks. 
[00:56:30]  They're dicks.  Go Sox.  Athletes.  Go Sox, right, Jimmy?  Go Sox.  Back at Dane Cook's show, I met.  There was three of them backstage at the Dane Cook show.  Yeah.  A quick hello.  And, again, I know it was backstage, not a baseball event.  They were very friendly.  Ben Mettortiz, he said he was friendly.  Whatever.  I'm sure some of them are jerks, too.  I'm sure they all are.  All athletes are.  They all are.  They don't make their living with their personalities.  That's why they don't mix well.  And, again, I know the fans deserve to be crapped on once in a while because they're awful.  That's why I set it up properly because I know it annoys me, and I know it's not going to annoy me. 
[00:57:00]  So, Guidry, you know who the greatest one was, and I'll never badmouth it again?  Oh, here it is.  Who?  Jason Giambi.  This guy came out, went to the bathroom, and he really didn't want to.  By the way, at this point, another observation, Jimmy's gone with poor Roland.  They're gone.  Yes.  And then I find out later that Jimmy decided to camp out outside the men's room to get  to the picture.  Best place to get your photos.  Just completely camped out.  I felt like Robert Reed.  I was just hanging outside the men's room.  And the bathroom wasn't in a place where it would be normal to just hang outside the 
[00:57:30]  men's room.  It was in a very awkward, like, nowhere's land type of area.  But every time you saw security, see, this was the beauty of it.  You'd see a black guy with a, and the security guys were actually, they were doing their jobs.  They were okay.  I mean, look, they got a job to do.  They, you know, they're going to want some dummy with a camera phone.  What the heck?  Could you stop?  That time you had eight runs.  Right.  So, who was the next one that came by?  Who was the next one that came by?  It was, it was Guidry. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, I just lost my train of thought.  Damn it.  Giambi.  Yeah, Giambi.  Okay.  Stopped and signed for everybody.  Took a picture with everybody.  There was probably about 50 or 60 people that asked him.  He doesn't want any negative press or anything.  But it was almost like, he was, he was just a nice dude, man.  Yeah.  And like, I understand, this is a dinner, these guys don't want to be bothered.  They're bothered every day.  But he was just pleasant.  You could just say, hey, Giambino.  Yeah, Giambino. 
[00:58:30]  No, I didn't say that.  I just said, hey, man, I'm friends with Brody Stevens and Yoshi, because he knows about anyone.  Hey, okay.  He like, didn't care, but he took the picture anyway.  Nice guy.  Yeah.  I was, I was very impressed.  I'll never bad mouth him again, because he wasn't a douche to the fans.  I mean, I know that all fans are burdens, unless we're mediocre looking women.  I understand that.  Because again, you're right.  Those are the ones that care when you lose.  Yeah.  Those are the ones that can tell you what, what games were won and lost to the 2001 World  Series, Derek.  It's the chick you took the picture with when you blew me off the first time, and after 
[00:59:00]  you blew me off again.  You're a stalker, man.  And it wasn't over.  Someone's saying, uh, inbred pest from PA.  Uh, Jimmy, did you say, but Derek, you're the champ.  No, I didn't say anything.  Hey, uh, can I pat myself on the back, uh, Mr. Torrance, with a fine observation.  On the flip side, I met Opie and Lindsay at Newark Airport last year, and he couldn't  be nicer.  He stopped walking, came back over to shake hands, started a conversation.  Just a cool guy.  Now that I think of it, maybe I met Greg Hughes, the actor that plays Opie in the Opie 
[00:59:30]  Anthony show.  Could have been.  Let's see who else was an absolute, uh, douche.  Okay.  Uh, okay.  Guidry was tolerable, kind of a dick vibe.  Uh, at one point, Tino Martinez walked out.  All right.  Very good.  I had been waiting by the bathroom like an absolute creep.  It's a good find.  So he's walking towards me.  I go, uh, Tino, can I get a quick shot with you?  And he looked annoyed.  I go, when you're done?  I thought he was going to the bathroom.  What's he do?  The security walks him through the, like an exit door.  They walk him through the exit and he leaves.  So that was my fault. 
[01:00:00]  But he's a dick.  And I saw it in your face, stupid.  When you're done leaving?  Yeah, when you're done.  Like maybe next season to get re-signed.  Robinson Cano, the rookie, one of the biggest jerk-offs ever.  You are a jerk-off, dude.  You're a jerk-off.  And I got a picture with him.  He took the picture.  Of course he did.  Thank God he did.  He stopped, God.  He did.  I had the camera.  I'm like, hey, Robinson. 
[01:00:30]  What would he have been if he didn't take a picture?  I'm like, hey, Robinson, can I get a picture?  He goes, all right, man, quick.  Make it quick.  You don't want to say that to Jimmy.  Why would you say that?  Dude, at this point, honest to God, it was me and Roland, maybe two people in this area.  There was nobody there.  It was you and what was left of Roland.  There was nobody out there.  That poor kid obviously needs friends desperately to agree to hang out with you.  It was not a mob scene.  There was nobody out there.  Okay?  There was nobody out there. 
[01:01:00]  I understand that there was a bunch of people.  There was not a bunch of people.  It was empty out there because I knew where to stand and started Roland.  Great moment.  Opie actually got me the best moment of the night, the only good moment of the night for  me.  Because in the end, I do look out for you.  You absolutely do.  So as much as I enjoy you being miserable, I also have your back at all times.  Security had to walk these guys, right?  So we would go and we saw security walking one of the players towards the bathroom.  Me and Roland would sneak out the front door and go by the bathroom and wait.  He had the whole plan.  So what happened?  Well, oh, Georgie Posada. 
[01:01:30]  I see him walking.  And as he's walking out, I go, okay, I want to get a picture.  And the security guy goes, let me go to the bathroom first.  I'm like, all right.  So I kind of feel like a dick.  Yeah.  So then Posada's coming out.  I had done a benefit for his wife.  She runs some organization.  So I did a benefit.  I performed at Stand Up New York for her.  So you got an in.  None of the players came, of course, because their names weren't on it.  I guess if it's not going to help your public relations face, so you can get a sneaker endorsement,  why would you show up for it?  But when he came out of the bathroom, I go, believe me, you got to throw out whatever 
[01:02:00]  you got.  I said, hey, man, I performed at a benefit for your wife.  And he goes, oh, okay, man.  I'm looking to get a quick picture.  He didn't want to stop, but he did because of that.  And I had the camera set to black and white, so it came out wrong.  And I'm panicking.  Oh, no.  And I'm like, George, your picture didn't come out.  And he reluctantly stopped again, and we got the picture.  Wow.  Would have been a dick.  Believe me.  Dick, but was okay, because I did a benefit for his wife.  Poor Roland.  Did you punch him in the face after it came out black and white?  It was my fault.  I'm not completely wrong.  1945 Roland. 
[01:02:30]  Poor Roland.  Oh, no, this sweat probably dripped onto the button and moved it.  Was it in, like, sepia tone?  Yeah, exactly.  It looked like an oldie-style Babe Ruth picture or something.  The highlight of my night came when, oh, by the end of the night, Roland looked like  he just got released from a Mexican prison.  Oh, yeah.  He was in shambles when I saw him.  Shambles.  He was just done, man.  You know, it's like a tour of duty going on a picture detail with Jim. 
[01:03:00]  You just don't want to do it.  It's like being on point in the nom.  Like I said, we got to get Bill Burr on the phone to back me up.  After the Metallica thing, I was done.  I can't be his camera assistant anymore.  No.  Because I like my friendship with Jimmy.  And this will break up our friendship.  I got a deferment so I don't have to ever take pictures for him.  Deferment.  You don't go out enough to be able to hang out with Jimmy.  Thank God.  No, I'm annoyed that I didn't get the Tina picture.  That's my fault.  Highland of my night came when Hope goes, come here, come here, come here, come here.  Spike Lee right there. 
[01:03:30]  Now, I love.  Spike Lee was one of the honorees.  The honorees were Spike Lee, Dave Winfield, Joe Torre.  Ali was supposed to be.  But he didn't show up, did he, Derek?  Good.  Maybe he knows you're a dick.  He's going to be at the Chicago one that they do.  This is all over the country.  And they hold another one in Chicago.  Yeah.  So he's going to be at that one.  I'm sure you'll be invited.  Is he really?  But they had a video presentation of him and his wife.  And, dude, I don't even know why you want Ali there.  It's Ali.  Dude, he's Ali.  No, he's not.  He's one of the greatest guys to ever live. 
[01:04:00]  Ali died years ago.  No, he's mentally the same guy.  That guy in that shell, that is just shaking.  I felt so bad during that video presentation.  He couldn't say word one.  He sat there.  His wife spoke.  And his wife had to hold on to him.  And they're both shaking like it's earthquake footage.  Dude, he has Parkinson's.  And she's saying everything.  Oh, I know.  I mean, he can't talk, but mentally he's fine.  Didn't think he was sitting on a paint shaker, Jim.  I know what he's got.  He's completely there. 
[01:04:30]  Although, he could have been.  I'm saying he's not like lost mentally.  He's not gone.  No.  Yeah.  He's still Ali.  He's just got posted.  Can he sign?  He was just leaning against the dryer.  He's fine.  And there was a couple of sneakers in there off balance.  Right.  The greatest athlete ever.  The guy could.  He probably would have said like,  Jimmy, I'll be right back.  And just left.  You're talking about the greatest athlete ever.  The greatest.  Don't even mention Babe Ruth, Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan.  I'll agree. 
[01:05:00]  I'll agree.  Greatest athlete ever.  Wait.  So, Spike Lee is walking by.  Thank you.  And of course, Spike Lee.  So, I walk over to Spike.  I always try to have my moment again.  Failure.  Just an unrecognizable nothing.  And he's with his kid, but he's in the middle of the audience.  Do you have a Spike in?  Yeah.  Hi, Spike.  I'm a white guy who can name more than just do the right thing.  Well, that's an in.  I meant it, too.  I told him I thought you were robbed with X in the Oscars.  I told him that.  And he's like, thank you.  I just got a quick picture.  He wasn't friendly or unfriendly.  He was indifferent. 
[01:05:30]  But he's pretty much what I expected him to be.  Like, he wasn't rude, nor was he polite.  Oh, right.  When I thought, if I had met Spike Lee, he'd be a little bit nicer.  But again, an event like that, you got your kid with you.  You don't want to be, okay, I get it.  So, he took the picture.  And I saw him later.  I said, good night.  He said, good night.  It was brief.  And that was that.  And the highlight of the night comes when we see Derek being walked out.  And I know where he's going.  He's going to the bathroom.  Wait, is this the end of the night?  Guys, we're coming up.  Is this attempt number three, by the way? 
[01:06:00]  All right.  Hold on.  Attempt two.  Okay.  Attempt two.  Do we want to continue with this?  Of course we do.  Raise your hands.  Because we got to take a break.  Raise your hands.  Damn breaks.  Because we have to get into the auction part.  Well, I want to hear about all the crap that went on, though, with the signatures.  And then we'll get to the auction part.  And then the auction part, because at one point, the entire place turned around and  looked at Jimmy.  Yeah.  And we'll tell you what happened with that.  He wanted to kill him.  And we'll tell you how it ended with the Derek Jeter thing.  Yeah. 
[01:06:30]  All right.  It's the only virus.  It's the gift basket.  It's the gift basket.  Oh, no.  Oh, the gift basket.  A lot of gifts.  Did you open it up when you got home and sort through the goods?  What the hell?  It's the day before a long weekend.  We'll continue with this, because it's way too good.  We do have other things we really want to get to today.  We'll see.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  We'll wrap up with Jimmy.  Hey, look, if you're getting impatient listening to it, turn something else on. 
[01:07:00]  I don't know what to tell you.  No, I don't think they are.  No.  To be honest with you, the phones have never been hotter.  The instant feedback, it can't even update fast enough with everyone's comments.  Most people with you, by the way, Jimmy.  Most people with you.  I don't care.  I've never blown off a fan in my life.  Go Sox, right?  Yeah.  I hate the Yankees, but for real.  I hate it.  And he hates that he hates the Yankees.  You don't understand.  Really?  Jimmy doesn't want to hate the Yankees.  He loves the Yankees.  But now it's all personal.  He's always loved the Yankees.  Of course he has.  Can I bring you to the dark side?  The Mets are doing great this year. 
[01:07:30]  Suck him.  I never liked the Mets, dude.  I don't like that organization.  The little brothers of the Yankees.  Respect Boston.  The little brothers.  Look at the standings.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  Call the Opie and Anthony show right now.  866-313-FREE.  Opie and Anthony.  Yo, this show rocks.  Thanks, buddy.  Where are you calling from?  Thrasherville, USA.  And what do you got for the show?  Pain.  This place is painful enough, buddy.  If you have a point that's relevant to the topic at hand, call the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:08:00]  At 866-313-FREE.  Rock!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  We're almost done with little Jimmy Norton from last night at the Derek Jeter event here in New York City.  Man, if you're just tuning in, I'm sorry. 
[01:08:30]  I don't know what to tell you.  It's been an unbelievable hour just listening to Jimmy have a meltdown.  It was a big night.  You've got to listen longer to the Opie and Anthony show.  You're missing stuff.  It was a big night.  We all went to the Derek Jeter charity event.  This is Turn 2 charity.  He's been doing it for 10 years.  A lot of people show up.  And Jimmy, Jimmy's into getting the pictures taken with the celebrities and the sports figures  and getting pictures that he has taken in the past with these people,  autographed at the events, getting the collection all together. 
[01:09:00]  And a lot of times he gets blown off and it gets him pissed off.  To a point of pissed off that none of us can really relate to.  It's someone came in.  It's like Death Wish pissed off.  A group came in, maybe raped and killed your daughter, sent her to a mental institution,  killed your wife, something like that.  That type of pissed off.  Paul Kersey pissed.  This brings him back to something that we don't know about yet. 
[01:09:30]  It's just a confirmation of just what a nothing I am.  And I'm serious.  That's exactly what it is.  But you're on the road from nothing to kind of know you-ville.  Yeah, exactly.  You're on an HBO show.  Exactly.  And nobody cares.  You were just on Tower Records.  Drop dead.  I read what you wrote today.  I'd like to bite your face, too, if you were here right now.  Wait, what did he do to you?  Just wrote, Lucky Louie has succeeded nothing more than being vulgar.  Sorry, we used dirty language, scumbag Puritan post writer. 
[01:10:00]  I hate the New York Post.  You know, I'm with you there.  John Minelli wrote an article on this show.  Why would they publish it?  And they didn't even publish it.  No.  No.  John Minelli listens every day.  I love you, bro, but I'm done with your paper.  Your paper stinks.  I'm done with your paper.  We could still be friends.  We could talk here and there.  But as far as doing interviews with you or anyone else at the Post, we're done with them.  They wrote a, I mean, he wrote a really nice article.  He sent it to me.  It was about the ratings and how we're having this massive comeback in radio.  It's one of the biggest radio stories ever. 
[01:10:30]  And what are they doing as far as the radio section goes?  What was their big story today?  I don't even know.  Don't even know?  I don't even know.  And then Minelli said, you know, it's going to be in the back section, which is a great part of the paper.  It's near the TV stuff.  It's near the place where most people go when they're reading the New York Post.  And then I wrote him and said, what's going on with the article?  He goes, well, now I think it's going to be in the business section on Tuesday.  And Tuesday, obviously, is what, three days ago at this point?  And there's no sign of this article because someone at the Post just hates our guts.  The others are, I'm sure.  And they're Howard fans and all that BS. 
[01:11:00]  Well, when they print Dopey Opie and Pervy Pal.  I want to get their names.  I just want to start giving out their names on the air.  We don't need the New York Post to be successful.  So, John, I'm sorry to say we're done with the paper you work for.  Done.  Done with them.  But anyway, go ahead, Jimmy.  I got to know what happened.  Back to douche.  At the event, we've covered a lot of ground.  Jeter is walking towards the bathroom.  He's got four security guards with him. 
[01:11:30]  This is your second attempt to get your picture signed.  All I want, I don't want to personalize, just Derek and Jeter on a picture of me and him.  That's it.  So, I stand outside the bathroom.  One of the massive security guards I know from Caroline's, he was a guy there.  He's a nice dude.  Oh, there's an in.  He goes, hey, Jim.  Well, he couldn't do anything, but I knew he wouldn't push me away.  Uh-huh.  So, Derek walks out.  Dude, I have my picture, the pen read.  I have the pen open. 
[01:12:00]  The cap isn't even on it.  It's in grab it and sign position.  It could take probably under a second.  Where's Roland?  Can Roland come in?  Oh, God.  Because he saw what happened.  He's barely standing up at this point.  He saw what happened.  Derek walks out.  I even said, just in case he didn't see it was a picture of me and him.  But, hey, man, can you sign this picture of me and you?  And he goes, oh, not now, man.  I'll do it later.  Oh, the old later gag.  And I knew that he purposefully looked at my face, didn't like me, and kept going. 
[01:12:30]  I knew.  And, Roland, you saw it.  Yeah, he had this look.  When he saw it, Jim, he was like, ah, not again.  He just didn't want to sign it.  He didn't want to sign it.  And I don't want to hear, well, it was a charity event.  He was only signing things that were paid for.  Because if that was the truth, then at the end of the night, I walked up to the stage,  like all the other fans, all the Yankees are on stage.  I have a picture with Joe Torrey. 
[01:13:00]  Joe was getting mobs, and he goes on the stage.  So here's what my strategy is.  I stand there with my picture out and the pen with Joe.  He can look and see it's a picture of me and him.  Torrey recognized that it was a picture of us, walks over to the end of the stage,  and he signs it for me.  Oh, nice.  Nice guy.  So you got Joe Torrey to sign the picture.  Got Joe Torrey to sign it.  All right.  Jeter, I stood there anyway.  Attempt number three.  Five times.  Looked over and did the, as soon as I looked, eye contact, look away.  This guy has something going on with him. 
[01:13:30]  Dude, you're a goddamn phony.  You try to come off like you're this great guy.  You're not a great guy.  You're a bum.  You're the greatest Yankee shortstop in history.  First ballot Hall of Famer.  They were going to retire your number.  No one is saying you're not the best shortstop in the history of the franchise.  You are.  You really are.  But what a jerk off you are.  And I saw it in your face.  I've signed enough autographs to know the difference.  You are a phony.  An absolute goddamn phony. 
[01:14:00]  And as he's walking off the stage, dude, the guy's a superstar.  He's getting mobbed.  I get it.  I get it.  He sees my picture five times.  Won't sign it.  Some dumb chick wants a – what did she say?  Oh, boy.  She said, I can't have your picture so I can put it up the next day at work for a screensaver.  That's what she said.  Give me your picture so I can put it up the next day for my screensaver.  And he stops for her.  And pick her up on stage.  He stopped.  Well, he stops for her.  Oh, my God.  Everybody rushes the stage.  Security blocks it. 
[01:14:30]  Derek starts to move because it's going to be crazy.  Derek stops again and has her come over so he can take the picture with her.  So, again, if it's only about signing things for charity, then he never would have taken that picture, which he was also charging for.  So, sorry again.  I'm not a chick.  I'm sure in 2001 when the Yankees lost two, then won three, and then lost two, she was as depressed as I am.  I'm sure after they won three and then dropped four straight to Boston, she was as bummed out as I was.  But remember he signed her pocketbook too?  Oh, did he sign the pocketbook too?  It wasn't even a card. 
[01:15:00]  That's exactly what you are as an athlete.  You're a goddamn phony as an athlete.  That's exactly what you are.  I can't tell you how much I hate this guy now.  Do you, um...  Wait, you hate who?  Jeter.  And the stars showed up in Times Square last night to support Derek Jeter and his Turn 2 foundation.  This helps kids turn away from drugs.  Fox News' Lisa Everett says all the action from the annual fundraising dinner at the Marriott Marquis.  Ten years later, it's a decade of hits for Derek Jeter and his Turn 2 foundation. 
[01:15:30]  Some sports world heavy hitters came out to honor the Yankee superstar for his good deeds.  It's gotten bigger and better than we ever imagined.  He has it!  Starting his foundation ten years ago in a hotel room with his father.  Now we can look back on all he's accomplished, raising millions of dollars to help thousands of kids in need.  Your host, the captain number two, Derek Jeter.  So what we try to do is help out as much as we can.  You know, we have support with our after-school programs. 
[01:16:00]  Could you please display a personality?  Unfortunately, we've been able to touch a lot of kids' lives.  He should be an operator for a living.  And look, hey, look, God bless him.  He's doing charity work.  And in fairness, his father was walking around.  Seems like the nicest guy on earth, Jeter's father.  Sorry, Mr. Jeter.  Your son is an entitled dick.  Wasn't he signing pictures for charity, though?  Could you, like, give him a couple hundred dollars and he would sign a picture?  Yeah, or you could have gotten the pictures.  And again, that's a charity thing, no problem. 
[01:16:30]  But when I saw what he did with that girl at the end, when he called her up, stopped, I didn't know he signed her purse.  But he said, I want a picture for a screensaver.  Maybe that's the line you have to use.  You understand what I'm saying?  That any guy that's ever been blown off by one of these scumbag athletes, that's why.  I hate them.  I hate them for that.  I have never blown off a fan, dude.  I'm sorry I'm yelling so much.  It's not, you know, whatever.  I hear it in your voice now.  I've never done it till gravelly.  You've got steps to do this weekend, Jeter.  You've got to relax.  I have never refused.  And then the auction, oh, and the gift bag. 
[01:17:00]  What a lovely.  And the auction sucked.  What was the one they auctioned off?  Hey, winner, winner, you can train with Derrick's trainer and you can have his cook cook for you.  Can I really?  What, that faggot going to show up at my house and show me how to make French toast?  How you doing, man who cooks for other men?  You want to whip me up something like a little dignity in a dish?  And a case of Gatorade?  And the bidding started at $10,000. 
[01:17:30]  At $10,000.  And this is the little thing they gave you.  Wait, wait.  As the bidding was going on, the room went silent as they're trying to, you know, get an extra grand out of the prize or whatever.  Because everyone was shocked that it started at $10,000.  It was virtually nothing that they were giving away.  They were giving away, like, swag that you would get anywhere.  And Jimmy couldn't help himself.  It was dead silent in the room.  There was easily a few hundred people there.  Maybe close to a thousand.  Who knows?  And all of a sudden you hear Jimmy loud as day go, clear as day go, can you throw in a Diet Coke? 
[01:18:00]  A Diet Coke.  I bid $3.  I bid $3.  At one point I bid a million dollars.  I bid $3 million.  He holds up his sign and goes, $3 million.  And people turn around, like, horrified looking at him.  That sucks.  Because he's so pissed off.  A case of Gatorade.  For what?  He's bidding $3 million on something.  $10,000 to work out with that faggot that cooks for you?  The guy on TV?  Why don't you drop dead? 
[01:18:30]  Julia Childs will come over and give you a happy ending.  Drop dead.  Your gift basket sucks.  Oh, he's breaking his auction.  Hey, that's my bit.  Hey, that's my bit.  Yeah, good.  Let's see the gift basket.  Oh, here's the gift basket.  Let's see the bag of goodies you got at the end of the night.  This is what you got for your $20,000 table.  Wow, look at this.  Dr. Joan Fallon, the voice of the Yankee fans.  Boy.  Beating it with the bat that came with the... 
[01:19:00]  Here you go.  Your gift basket...  Sucked.  He can't rip ten pages at a time, so he had to, like, make it into five pages.  Sorry.  I'm not an athlete who blows off real fans.  Oh, God.  You just broke your mic.  All right.  Let's see.  No one's listening to me anyway at this point.  All right.  What else you got in the gift basket?  Here.  Oh, there we go.  That smile.  The life you imagine.  Wow.  Let's see.  Oh, I imagine blowing people off. 
[01:19:30]  I imagine having no personality and a boyish smile.  I imagine being a phony seasucker and blowing off a hardcore fan with a picture of me and him  so I can get some whore a screensaver shot.  Stop.  I dropped the book.  You couldn't even slam the book.  You went and slammed the book, and it flew out behind him.  I dropped the book.  It's exactly how it should have happened.  He tried to make a statement by slamming the book into the floor. 
[01:20:00]  Very dramatically.  As he lifted his arm up, it flew out behind me.  He locked it and it flew behind him.  Because you're a nobody.  Maybe if Derek saw that, he would have signed it because he would have thought I was one of  his chick fans.  You are a retard at a t-ball game.  You really are.  Wait.  There's pictures in the book, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Oh, these are really touching pictures.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, there's nice family pictures.  Just a cheap...  What's it say?  I don't...  You know, there.  There he is. 
[01:20:30]  There's all number two.  Now, but hang.  Shut up.  Go Sox, right, Jimmy?  Yeah, I actually do want to...  Oh, look at the charming...  There.  There's the face of baseball.  Look at...  Isn't that...  Look at that.  Charming.  Yeah.  All right.  There he goes.  Wow.  Look at...  Whoa.  Oh, no, no.  The Derek Jeter turn two foundation dinner.  Oh, it is high.  No, it is far.  You're not... 
[01:21:00]  You just broke the trophy.  I broke the trophy.  But you could have put that on your trophy shelf.  Yeah, I could have, right?  But what...  Behind what?  Behind what?  It's a card.  Can you kick that over, Sam, with your stupid feet?  Hey, hey, Sam's a nice guy.  Leave Sam alone.  Yeah, I'm sure Sam would love Jeter.  They have something in common.  Let's...  Here it is.  It's the June 2006 10th anniversary.  It's a little...  The cheapest trophy I've ever seen in my life. 
[01:21:30]  It's a piece of plastic around a baseball card.  And there's a stand on it.  And it's trapped like everything else.  And then...  Yeah, what else was in the gift bag?  It's a CD.  I wonder what it is.  It's probably just a bunch of people going,  Derek's so nice.  I met Derek once.  It was really nice.  A bunch of girls going,  he signed something for me because I'm a screensaver.  Bye.  Everything back on the gift basket.  Oh, dude, the gift basket.  Soap.  They give you sporty soap.  So what?  So you can clean your face as you're crying  because one of your idols shot you down to sign something? 
[01:22:00]  So I can wipe off my back,  which feels more masculine than the way you treated me?  You douche.  Will one person who knows him  tells him,  you're a phony,  and I saw it in your face.  You are a phony.  That's who you are.  There goes the soap.  What a nice gift basket.  I'm surprised you didn't sell this for 15 grand on the way out.  Wow, the Yankee hat.  Hey, hey, hey. 
[01:22:30]  Oh, ho.  Oh, ho.  Oh, ho.  What, Jimmy?  Oh, this is a gem.  The Derek Jeter.  The Yankee Hummer.  How appropriate.  20 grand?  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  It's a fleet card,  and in it is a little race car with the Yankees on it.  It's a Derek Jeter matchbox car.  It's a matchbox car.  Yeah.  Isn't that a card, though, also? 
[01:23:00]  Like a Derek Jeter card?  You know what?  Let me open it and see.  I think it is.  Let me open it up for you, people.  It's a matchbox car with a Jeter card.  Oh, who cares?  He's eating it.  He's eating it.  He's eating it.  He's eating it.  Suck.  He's eating it.  He's eating it like George the Animal Steel.  What am I going to do?  This is the whole thing.  I'm done.  I mean, that's why I had to get it off my chest.  Yeah.  I have never – De Niro blew me off for a picture, dude. 
[01:23:30]  He was nice about it.  He didn't want to get mobs.  I have never been more disappointed meeting a celebrity than Jeter.  I can't believe I hate Jeter.  Do you understand how hard this is to hate a guy I have loved for all these years?  Yeah, it must be tough.  Oh, I hate athletes, dude.  I hate them.  Do you, like, condone what happened at Columbine because of that?  It was a smaller level of just the jock athlete blowing off the – maybe the funny guy, the guy that didn't kind of come off like the athlete. 
[01:24:00]  I don't think Jeter is a bully.  I don't think he's a bully.  Those guys were fighting bullying.  I don't think he's a bully.  I just think he's just a pretty boy, great player, but a dick, and that's who he is.  And all the guys that say he's a nice guy, he probably had a reason to be nice to you.  He had no reason to be nice to me.  I saw it in his face.  He's not a nice dude.  Three times.  Three times, yeah.  And he looked right at it, and he signs for a chick.  So that's – you know, come on, you're a douche.  Joe Buck of Fox Sports gave the play-by-play on stage. 
[01:24:30]  Backstage, I sat down exclusively with some of the honorees at the dinner, one of them Yankee legend Dave Winfield.  He was a role model to Derek on the field and off and one of the first athletes to start his own charitable foundation.  I just kind of dedicated my career not only to being the best ball player I could be, but really giving back.  Yankee manager Joe Torre, who was given the leadership award, created his own foundation with his wife, Allie, to fight domestic violence.  He admires Derek for making a difference.  To fight domestic violence. 
[01:25:00]  Well-worded.  Stupid.  Well, Lisa, you know, I know a lot of sports personalities don't really care to be role models, but we're stuck with it.  Whether you like it or not, we are role models.  Children look up to us.  I asked Derek what his favorite moment was helping the kids.  He said it was coaching a hitless Little League team to score their first run.  Wow.  What a moving moment.  I'm getting all choked up.  Joe Torre is stopping women from having their asses kicked all over the living room, and you're teaching some fat kid how to score.  Wow. 
[01:25:30]  Way to be.  That's it.  There you go.  Good.  That should be your best moment.  A hitless team got to run.  Well, that's a big moment in life.  Let's go to Pete in New Jersey.  Pete.  Yeah, you guys there?  Yeah, let's go.  You got it.  Let's go.  Let's go.  I apologize.  I understand it's really good radio and everything.  I understand, you know, everyone's listening.  Everyone's getting a good laugh.  Do you have any idea what you're doing to yourself right now?  Dude, I'm just, I feel better.  I have never been more irritated in a situation like this than I was. 
[01:26:00]  They have people at these events called security for guys like you.  No, they don't.  No, absolutely not.  At that event, I did not one inappropriate thing.  I didn't try to walk through security.  I wasn't in the way.  I stood by the side.  And my irritation, I saved for the next morning.  I didn't cause a problem there.  They don't have events for security like me.  They have events for security with guys who don't know when to back off, which I did.  I've had my own brush with the same type of event that you had. 
[01:26:30]  I was 13 years old.  We had our football dinner at LT's Restaurant.  If anybody's listening, remember, it's in like Rutherford, New Jersey, right around Route 17.  No cares where it is.  Right, right, right.  So all the Giants show up.  Everybody's like having a great time.  Odessa Turner, Stephen Baker.  I mean, like, these are like little kids having their football dinner there.  Everyone's got, like, nice speeches.  Oh, my God.  Get to the point.  Point.  Point of the story.  Point of the story is LT shows up.  Here we are spending money in his place.  The guy shows up. 
[01:27:00]  Doesn't even lift his head for one picture.  Signs like five autographs.  And blows off about half of our 13-year-old football team.  I mean, I had my own, like, devastation because, you know, Lawrence Taylor didn't look up during a friggin' picture.  But, Jimmy, get over it, dude.  You're how old?  You're successful in life.  What the hell is your problem?  If they're a genius, so what?  What's my problem is, dude, that I've dealt with fans enough to know when someone is legitimately just busy and being hustled off because they're running around and the guy's a superstar and when they're being a scumbag. 
[01:27:30]  I know the difference, and I've never once had a fan present me with a fan.  Yeah, when you're in the public eye, it's your responsibility to take care of the fans.  Sometimes it's a pain in the ass.  Sometimes you do want to go do other things.  Sometimes you want to leave an event right away.  But you've got to understand how important your fans are.  And we do.  And I'm at a charity event.  Not that we're on the same level as a Derek Jeter, but I think that's what Jimmy's getting at.  We went to Tower Records two, three weeks ago.  We were supposed to be there maybe an hour and a half, two hours.  We spent five hours there because we wanted to make sure everyone went away with a nice impression of us and the show and have them walk away with a picture of us or an autograph. 
[01:28:00]  And we had about 600 people there.  There's probably maybe 150 people more.  Jeter had like 700 or 800 people there.  We had about 600 people at the Tower thing.  I even said we even hustled the line so nobody would be kept off the line.  Yeah, because Tower Records wanted to shut it down.  They wanted to shut it down.  So we're like, all right, let's at least hurry people through this so everyone gets a chance to say hi.  At a quick moment, a genuine hello.  Sometimes it's all you have time for.  Or that's all I wanted at a later.  It's, hey, man, nice to see you.  Go on with you now. 
[01:28:30]  You know what is surprising that he just liked?  Not to me it's not because they're all like that.  You know what has to be said too?  And I have no idea about Derek Jeter at all.  I want to state that.  But a lot of these things that these athletes and these celebrities do, they're doing it because they need a tax write-off.  Well, they don't really give a crap about the actual cause.  And like I said, I'd say that knowing nothing about Derek Jeter and what he's doing.  Whatever the charity.  That's why you'll have a million stories of these guys doing something nice but they're blowing everyone off because they're just going through the motions to get the tax write-off.  And to the guy who said, how old are you? 
[01:29:00]  I'm 37.  It's common knowledge.  I like to do this, dude.  It's what I like about being in show business is that occasionally one of the things I like, you get access to things like that.  That's what's fun for me.  You like to drink.  You like to do what you do.  Okay.  That's what I like to do.  Well, not in prostitution.  Those are the things I like to do.  So what team are you going to root for now that you're not a Yankee fan?  I want to see the Red Sox smash them because, dude, it wasn't just Peter.  What about the Tigers?  Detroit's having a great year.  I don't care about any of that stuff.  It's just Boston is the ones.  What about the Pirates?  Sox is the insult.  Yeah.  Sox is the insult.  Sox makes it personal.  They were nice. 
[01:29:30]  Every Yankee I met, except for Giambi, was not nice.  Even the ones that stopped were not nice.  And they didn't want to stop.  I know they didn't want to stop.  All right.  Let's go to Matt in Westchester.  Matt, what's up?  We've got to wrap this up and move on to some other things.  We've got Bob Kelly in studio playing Carolines here in New York City all weekend long.  And I heard he killed last night.  A lot of fans went and checked out Bob.  Matt, go ahead.  Yeah.  Hey.  How are you doing?  Hey.  You know, Jimmy, you remind me of that old lady in the scene in The King of Comedy when  Jerry Lewis was walking down the street. 
[01:30:00]  And she stops him.  She's like, hey, hey, I want an autograph.  It's for my sister.  It's for my sister.  I can't.  I can't.  I can't.  No, really?  Please, please, please.  And he's like, no, I can't.  I can't.  She walks away.  She screams, you should get cancer.  I hope you get cancer.  Well, what she wanted, dude, and this happened to me last night, she wanted Jerry to talk  to her nephew on the phone.  On the phone.  I had a guy stop me when I walked in.  Dude, big fan.  Love your stuff.  Thanks, man.  Would you mind signing something for my nephew?  So I signed it.  No problem.  I'm here, man.  Happy to do it.  And then he goes, well, would you mind talking to him?  And I'm like, I can't.  I was actually going.  I was actually at the beach.  Oh.  I think a lot of people went to that event last night, by the way, thinking they were 
[01:30:30]  going to hobnob.  And it was so obvious that we were completely separated from all the, quote, celebrities  that were there.  Completely separate from me.  You got to be realistic.  So wait, wait, wait.  So she asked you to talk and you said no?  He asked me to.  He didn't have a phone out.  It wasn't like he had the phone right here.  He was just going to call and see if the guy was there.  Yeah.  No, I'm not doing that.  I was actually trying to get to where Jita was to get this way early in the evening.  But I signed something.  I was polite to the guy. 
[01:31:00]  I was like, hey, man, thanks for being a fan.  I appreciate it.  And that was it.  All right.  Did he go away fine or was he pissed that you didn't do the phone thing?  He was like, oh, thanks for stopping, man.  No, you understand.  I wasn't being a dick.  I wasn't rude.  All right.  Listen, I mean, the last hour has been unbelievable.  And we could easily do another hour on this.  Easily.  But we have to take a trip to Mantown after the break.  Oh, new first thing.  We have an actual Mantown bit.  From them?  From them.  All right.  From them.  Enough said.  And we got Bob Kelly playing Carolines all weekend long.  We highly recommend you see Bob Kelly. 
[01:31:30]  He's blowing up right in front of our eyes.  212-757-4100 for tickets to see Bob Kelly.  And with the last hour of radio, there's a great opportunity to do something with the audio and win an iMac.  Yeah.  This is a great tie-in.  We got five iMacs we're giving away a week from today.  Basically, we're asking you to send us your 30-second or less production pieces about the Opie and Anthony show.  You can take the rant Jimmy just had, cut that thing up, put it to make it seem like a movie trailer. 
[01:32:00]  Right.  You know, put some sweet music behind it to make it seem charitable.  I think this is going to really up the ante in this contest.  Yeah, there's plenty of things you could do.

[01:32:30]  All right.  Before we go, a quick thing.  Just watch Lucky Louie this week.  I actually have more than one scene, finally, and I have a really disgusting Fourth of July speech.  Good.  So, tune in Sunday night after Andourage.  But you're a nobody.  I know I'm a nobody, but that's why I had to remind them to tune in.  But you're on your way, is what it is.  You're on your way.  You're a little Jimmy Morton.  One of these days, you're going to be that guy.  Not the bad guy, but you're going to be the guy that people want to come up to.  And, you know, and the celebrities go, hey, Jimmy Norton.  Never.  One of the reasons that I'm nice to the fans all the time is because I've been on the other end of that so many times. 
[01:33:00]  As a fan, I know what it's like to be treated like a dick, dude.  That's why I don't treat you guys like dicks, because it sucks.  Remember the time we chased Randy Johnson down 57th Street?  He's another douche.  That was another moment where I had to be the assistant with the camera.  Another Yankee moment.  Another douche.  Exactly.  Another Yankee douche.  We were at the Brooklyn Diner, and I go, Jimmy.  I don't think he was in the diner.  I go, Jimmy, Randy Johnson.  He goes, come on, come on, come on, come on.  And he hands me the camera.  Hands me the camera, and I'm running. 
[01:33:30]  It's just the worst situation to be in.  You're so nervous.  Got to get it right.  Got to get it right, because you know how much it means to him.  And there's Jimmy.  The guy has to be like 7'8".  I mean, you'd think he's tall on TV.  Who knows how tall he really is.  They say 6'9".  I think he's even taller.  And Jimmy's trying to tap him on the shoulder.  He's reaching way up.  And he gets completely blown off in the middle of midtown Manhattan.  I laugh so hard.  And I'm just taking pictures as he's walking away of Randy Johnson's back. 
[01:34:00]  What did he say to you that blew you off?  I said, can I get a picture with you, man?  And he goes, no, thank you.  And he walks away.  I've said thank you.  How about this?  Can you pitch a big game without choking?  No, thank you.  How about that, Randy?  The ONA virus spreading across America.  It's like punch sound, woman scream, Opie and Anthony.  That's right.  Opie and Anthony.  Hear what everybody else is talking about. 
[01:34:30]  ONA, uncut and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio, starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi.  Do, do, do.  Right before the big Fourth of July weekend. 
[01:35:00]  What's happening this weekend?  Actually, it's what, Tuesday?  Bad day for Fourth of July for a lot of people.  So, the Tuesday, Fourth of July, what do you got to do?  Go into work Monday, and then you're off Tuesday.  And you know nothing gets done that Monday.  When you have to go in for the one day, nothing gets done.  And then nothing gets done Wednesday because everybody's kind of hung over and partied out from Fourth of July. 
[01:35:30]  So, as far as man hours getting accomplished, nothing really gets done.  It's good for me because I got to hit the road right after the show today.  Hit the road, Jack.  Where are you going?  Nantucket.  Final destination.  Yeah, Nantucket.  Nantucket.  You taking a ferry over?  A ferry, yes.  A ferry.  Yeah.  It's going to be good.  I got my back waxed yesterday. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, that's a little odd.  The summer waxing.  That's a little odd still.  I don't care what season it is.  It's not odd.  It is odd.  Why?  Because, um, actually, the good thing I've never seen your back.  Were you in a beauty parlor two days ago?  Um, I was at a hair salon.  Were you in a beauty parlor two weeks ago?  No, it's called...  Two days ago?  It's called John Sahag.  John Sahag. 
[01:36:30]  Not John's Hog, as some people have suggested.  Did you get things done to look a little prettier?  It is one of the premier, uh, hair cutteries in Manhattan.  And, uh, yeah, I got my hair cut.  And then, uh, they put, like, a rinse in there.  It's like a, uh, uh, like a, uh, color rinse.  Did any of it splash all over your face and chin?  There's plenty of guys out there that, uh, get a, uh, uh, a back waxing every once in a while. 
[01:37:00]  It's unsightly.  I got...  Well, I, I won't...  You get your back waxed?  I got my, uh, is this, is this on?  Hey, Bob Kelly playing Caroline.  It's all week and long.  I actually got my, uh, my, that's what my girl does.  May I, uh, my fiancee, uh, does, uh, um, uh, the little waxing of the...  Bikini waxing?  Yeah, that thing.  Brazilian waxing?  Oh, she's got great stories about women coming in just awful.  She has to hold her nose, almost throws up.  Really?  I want to get, I want to actually go to her for a Brazilian. 
[01:37:30]  You're going to get a Brazilian?  No, dude, no.  No.  What?  What?  First of all...  Yeah, where's she work, man?  You're hairless anyway, Jimmy.  No, it's not happening.  Yeah, let's, where's she work?  Like, we'll all just wind up for our...  A bunch of ONA bald goatee fans going to get ass waxings.  Excuse me, can you do my shrink, Donnie?  See, that's when it gets weird, by the way.  Yeah.  That's where I agree with you.  Getting your ass waxed or something.  Why?  You can't do that.  You get your ass waxed?  Why?  Wait a minute.  You're saying it like if I do it...  Look, I get, I'll be completely honest, I get awful hair. 
[01:38:00]  It's, it's in no pattern that makes sense.  So I'm, uh, some...  Like Cro-Magnon, man?  Huh?  So I'm conscious...  Oh.  Stop showing your dress!  Your ass!  Bob.  It's kind of plump, actually.  It is, like, fat.  You got a big, wide butt.  You have a Brazilian girl ass.  Carnival ass.  You got ass spiders.  What?  But you have, it's like a wispy hair thing.  Yeah, it looks like, uh, I want, like, the Three Stooges.  Larry's head.  Larry's head. 
[01:38:30]  Hey, I'm an ass, Moe.  See, you know, yes, I'm...  I don't like that I showed my ass, and everybody freaked out for a second,  and then you all looked and kind of liked it, and...  Eh, we didn't care.  Well, you gotta look, you know, what the hell.  But, uh, no, I get unsightly, like, and I'm conscious of it, like, hair on the sides.  It's in no pattern that you go, ah, who the hell cares?  I care.  I'm gonna be honest.  And it grows really long, and it's disgusting.  So, like, once a summer, I go, and, uh, I get everything ripped off, and then I'm good 
[01:39:00]  for almost a year.  Now, can't you remedy that?  Sometimes I'll get it done, uh, if we're, if we, uh, if, for our winter vacation, if I'm  going to an island.  Yes.  But can't you get, deal with that in the privacy of your own home, perhaps with some  hair and meat?  As soon as you have your, your, your chick shaving or waxing your old back.  I don't mean your chick doing it.  Relationship over.  I don't mean your chick doing it.  I don't mean your chick doing it.  You can't reach back there by yourself.  Look at you reaching right now.  Try.  Try.  You can't reach your back. 
[01:39:30]  You can't wax your back.  I don't know.  You were pointing out your sides.  Well, then I'm gonna take care of the whole thing.  I'm not just gonna get rid of the sides.  You know, I get a little shoulder hair.  Nothing too crazy.  Get it laser.  Get it laser.  Get it laser, dude.  It's not bad.  If he's gotta do it because his girl likes it better like that.  I don't have to explain myself.  She doesn't even care.  Honestly, she doesn't even care.  It's something I care about.  And there's plenty of guys out there that do a little, a little this, a little that.  I was saying it was bad.  Get your ass.  I want an explanation.  That's all.  But here's the deal.  This is what I was getting at.  So I'm at this place and it's a, it's a pretty reputable place or whatever. 
[01:40:00]  And I got a Polish chick waxing my back that used to be like this big singer, I guess.  And she had the accent that you always do on the show.  She was wonderful.  I was big singer back in Poland.  And now I do it back waxing.  That's what I was wondering what went horribly wrong for this poor chick because she said  she came from Poland as a singer to America to make it.  She had contracts through Chicago.  Oh, sure she did.  And she's got awful commies that come over here and just bad mouth the United States of 
[01:40:30]  America.  They, they bad mouth it and talk about how wonderful it was where they were when they  were there and, uh, what, what they used to do.  And it's always some great thing.  Like this woman was a singer, uh, guys all the time are brain surgeons or engineers.  I helped build the Trans-Siberian Railroad with wonderful engineer.  I built the locomotive.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Uh, 59th and, uh, 7th, please. 
[01:41:00]  Could you drive me up there?  Because now you're a cab driver.  You Mr. Brain Surgeon Rocket Scientist all in one.  And, and this one now was a great singer and now she's ripping hair out of my back and tell  me how she used to be this big singer.  Here's her big contract, by the way.  Yank out 40 gallons of this and we'll give you food, perhaps some porridge.  Mediocre lounge singing dummy.  Porridge.  You have some porridge, stupid. 
[01:41:30]  Back in the packing crate and back on the ship.  Here's a lime and an orange.  Or whatever.  For the entire transatlantic voyage.  Why both citrus barbers?  You don't get scurvy.  You don't get scurvy.  You don't want the scurvy on the open seas.  Somebody watches the, uh, Discovery Channel.  Yeah.  Yeah, so it's a, it's a quick boring story.  Anyone have scurvy in the past 800 years?  Polish, ex-Polish singer ripping the hair out of my back.  Yeah.  Very, very depressed.  Can I see your back?  And her life stinks now.  Can I see your back? 
[01:42:00]  Well, it's an OP.  Let me see it.  Ooh, I like that.  Feels better, I'm sure.  You know, you should have my girl, Laser.  You can get your hair, all these girls.  Lasers, are they reputable?  They're very reputable.  Oh, you watch television, you can get your vagina lasered.  Tearing the hair out of me.  Let's go to, would she laser my girl?  Seriously, I know this girlfriend, she's a sweet girl, but I would love to go get a Brazilian,  man.  She would do like a Brazilian wax all around.  Why do you need a Brazilian?  Wait, you're serious?  Are you serious?  No, you can't be serious.  You are the most hairless individual.  I'll just do it at Bob's place.  Like, well, I'm sure she's got the equipment.  Oh, I gotcha. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, no, no, no.  People, people are laughing at me today.  He has nothing down below.  I know, he doesn't.  That's creepy to me.  It is creepy.  See, that's where I say creepy.  There's people saying creepy because they're hearing me tell them that I got my back waxed.  But what he does to me is creepy.  If you clear away the hedges, bushes, and brambles, it makes it look like you own more property.  Absolutely.  That's the goal of having good landscaping around your house.  A lot of times it looks like you got a small yard because your bushes are all overgrown from the neighbor's yard. 
[01:43:00]  What you do is you trim it all back, and now people go, what a large, wonderful, huge, throbbing yard you have.  And it's also, if somebody decides to put your house in their mouth, you don't want them getting shrubs and brushes all over their face.  Look, I get, like, keeping it all nice and stuff.  I get that part.  Opie's the man because he actually has the man gene that grows hair.  Norton, you know, that's a very feminine thing, not have hair. 
[01:43:30]  I shave it, stupid.  I have it.  I'm very smooth, but I shave all of it.  Norton's a little boy.  Women like that, dude.  Women like it when you're, you know.  I keep it trim and nice and, well, whatever.  I don't know what they're going to dump out of, but you get rid of everything.  I trim mine.  I don't get rid of everything.  You got to keep a little thing, a little manly to make it look like a man.  You got to have a mustache on it.  You know what looks like a man?  An old-time, like, weightlifter with a big barbell mustache.  Yeah, you got to have a little goatee. 
[01:44:00]  A circus guy.  I actually changed mine.  It looks like a Nacho Libra today.  Nacho.  You got to, yeah, sometimes.  I'm not against taking the old man clipper thing and getting rid of some, like, overgrown brush,  but never taking it down to a skin level.  Yeah, you don't want to.  You're ridiculous, Jimmy.  You don't want to take away the yard and then just pour concrete in the front yard.  Yeah, it's like the Italian neighborhood.  We're just going to take out the grass and pave the entire yard. 
[01:44:30]  Right.  We're just going to have a couple tomato trees over here.  Yeah, the tomato plants go in the back.  In front, though, I wanted it so I could drive right up on my lawn.  Yeah, we got a bocce car, but it's an indoor-outdoor carpet.  And they paint the concrete green to make it look like it might have been grass, but it's cement.  What the hell is that for?  To fit all the getaway cars?  You goddamn criminals.  Believe me, women love it, though.  I've said to women, do you prefer it like this?  And they go, uh-huh.  Oh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. 
[01:45:00]  You guys want to do a little Man-Town?  Well, we're in Man-Town.  Man-Town.  We're in Man-Town.  We're in Man-Town.  We're in Man-Town.  A little man-to-man comparing.  Who's up for it, boys?  We have an actual Man-Town bit.  Yeah.  This is going to be great.  Oh, this is from them.  This is an actual Man-Town bit.  Is this a made-up thing?  You want to explain to the...  We're getting new listeners every day.  It's theirs.  Man-Town.  Well, the station we were competing with until we were on the air six months and beat them.  Six months? 
[01:45:30]  Not even...  Oh, excuse me.  Six weeks?  Try 30 days.  Was it 30 days?  Jesus Christ.  We beat them in 30 lousy days.  Amazing how quickly the time goes.  So now we're just having fun for the hell of us.  Yeah.  Their big bit, their big thing, their signature, their benchmark is something called Man-Town.  Now, Man-Town, for those of you that don't know, is a place where men can go.  I don't mean like a bar or someplace you have to go to and pay for drinks or things like that.  It's in your own house somewhere. 
[01:46:00]  It could be a room.  It could be the garage.  You've converted it into what you call Man-Town.  It could be the shed out back.  You invite your friends over.  Maybe you've hooked up the old TV that you threw out because you got real TVs inside because your wife hen-pecked you enough to get real TVs inside.  Maybe flat screen.  So the big old bulbous tube zenith goes out to the garage and you invite your friends over, sit around with a cooler of cheap beer and go,  Guys, we're in Man-Town now. 
[01:46:30]  The wife can't bug us unless she needs something.  Then I'll run real quickly and get what she needs, but I'll be back soon.  And it's supposed to be like a refuge for real men.  Camaraderie.  A refuge.  How about you send the wife out to pick stuff up for the guys while you hang around and have the entire run of the house for Man-Town?  Hey, uh, pass the chips, Pete.  Hey, you got it.  I love this place, Man-Town. 
[01:47:00]  Thinking of building one in my house.  Yeah.  Yeah, real good.  Place where guys can be guys.  Guys.  Anyone got the tarp for the floor before we start aiming for the cracker?  Welcome to Man-Town.  Man-Town.  You guys ready for the Man-Town bit?  Whoever finishes first loses.  Yes, the official bird of Man-Town is a robe.  Faggots.  This bit was actually on a CD that listeners had to buy.  They did.  Oh, we apologize for that.  I was going to say appreciate, but we don't appreciate much. 
[01:47:30]  We can apologize for it, though, that you had to pay for that.  So here's an actual Man-Town bit from the Hillman and the gang.  The Hillman Morning Show is doing a Man-Town bit.  It's all about Man-Town.  And now, another exciting episode of Man-Town in Color, starring Clint Eastwood as Rick Hill and Jack Pellinson and John Wayne as The Neighbors. 
[01:48:00]  Tonight's episode, That Smell.  Well, boys, another Friday night.  Another night to ourselves.  Our manly selves.  Here in...  Man-Town.  Hillman, I've got to ask.  I'm as tough as the next Joe.  Not much bothers me, but, uh...  What is that smell?  What do you mean?  I know what you're saying, partner.  There's something real funky stinking up this joint.  Well, I haven't been down here much lately.  Maybe something spilled. 
[01:48:30]  Maybe something died.  It smells worse than the Duke's boxes down here.  Knock it off, partner.  Let's take a look around.  You sure no one's been down here?  Uh, L.B. did sleep here last week.  You let L.B. sleep in...  Man-Town?  Well, yeah.  Oh, no!  That's gotta be it.  It's gotta be around here somewhere.  Uh-huh.  Right here, partner.  L.B. lost his cookies.  Should we clean it up?  Oh, well, uh... 
[01:49:00]  It is...  Man-Town, after all.  Yeah!  They don't clean it up in frothouses.  Or army barracks.  Right.  We don't care.  It's just a little smell.  Greg!  What the hell is that smell?  It reeks down there!  Uh...  L.B. got sick.  Uh, honey?  Well, clean it up now!  It's disgusting!  We need that room clean for Julia and her friend's tea party!  Uh...  Uh...  Okay.  Sorry. 
[01:49:30]  Join us next time for another episode of Man-Town, when Greg says...  Honey, do we have any more resolve?  Ugh.  I crap you not!  Here's what the smell was.  It was the stink coming off that bit.  That bit stunk.  It made me mad.  I like the rich, little, and Frank Gorshin impressions that they're doing.  Look, I got my arms folded.  I'm so pissed off.  It's topical.  I'm really pissed off.  I got mad that that stunk so bad.  It made me mad at Boston.  Because anybody would listen to that. 
[01:50:00]  Right.  That's arguably...  And this includes Al-Zar Cowie footage.  The unfunniest thing I've ever heard.  Wow.  Ever.  People are gonna think we just made that.  That is an actual Man-Town bit.  That they played...  They played, like, in heavy rotation, thinking it was great.  They thought it was so good, they put it on a CD.  A CD.  I'm mad that it took 30 days to beat them.  I'm mad at our fans in Boston.  It should have been 15.  What took you so long? 
[01:50:30]  That should be on a CD.  A cross-dresser.  That's what you should be carrying, is that witless, unfunny Man-Town bit.  That's what you get.  That's what you get.  That was disgusting.  You know what?  I hate how they have a, you know, we have to be such pussies.  Yeah.  Honey, shut up.  Go make me chilly.  You know what?  Growing it up yourself.  The feedback's coming in.  No one believes that that was a real bit from you.  Honest, dude.  They really think that we, like, set them up or reworked a bit or something.  No.  That's it.  That's the bit.  It's off a CD.  You can find it yourself. 
[01:51:00]  Look at this.  Dan wants to know if he's listening to Logo, the gay channel.  Oh, because of our conversation.  Thank you, Dan.  Very funny, Dan from Maine.  Way to go, Dan.  I'm going to make my girl actually give you a bikini wax now to teach her a lesson, Jim.  I like that.  That's right.  She's going to wax you.  I'll wear some Speedos.  I'll get an eyeful.  What's wrong with that?  Take the Speedos right off.  All right.  So there you go.  That's it.  Man-Town.  That's it.  It's worse than I imagined.  I thought it was going to be bad, but it's worse than I could have imagined. 
[01:51:30]  I'm mad at David Lee Roth for not beating them.  That's the worst thing I've ever heard.  What a bunch of out-of-touch corn balls.  Yeah, but who says, yeah?  There's got to be people being...  Look, if I say something unfunny, there's like 20 people that go, you stink.  That's stunk.  You stink, you stink, you dummy.  Shut your face.  Where are the people that hang around them that just say, yeah, thumbs up?  If.  That's the one.  People are really pissed off out there. 
[01:52:00]  If.  They count on us for laughs, and we just spent two minutes with that.  I want to leave.  That made me angry.  If.  And you know when you recorded something?  I remember recording bits on like 8-track and stuff, and it would take a long time, and  you'd have to listen to it 20, 30 times over.  And you'd start second-guessing yourself, like, is this even funny?  Because you heard it 20 times, so you're not a good judge of it.  You're like, is this even funny anymore, a song parody or whatever?  And then you'd play it, and it would get a good reaction, so you're like, oh, good. 
[01:52:30]  You know, another opinion.  What would that sound like after 20 times of hearing it over and over as you're producing it?  I just picked up on Jimmy's stupid if.  Oh, if.  Oh, eight times.  If I said something.  Jackass.  People are saying it's stuck so bad that you cannot even joke on it.  Yeah.  We can't even goof on it.  There's no goof there.  When they said Mantown, I thought, oh, my God, Mantown, they're just going to parody 
[01:53:00]  how corny and awful it is.  Yeah.  That was just a bad Clint Eastwood impression.  Yeah.  That's all that was.  Yeah.  It was Bill Pullman.  And a Duke, a John Wayne, Clint Eastwood impression from, like, it's just terrible.  It's like, like I said, Rich Little from 1970, Johnny Carson show.  Who does those impressions anymore?  The creaking door.  What's going on down there?  Hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop. 
[01:53:30]  How about a domestic violence joke?  How about, what's going on?  Shut up, bitch.  Close the door.  Guys.  Welcome to Mantown.  As she tumbles down the stairs into Mantown.  Absolutely.  Loses the baby.  To manslaughter town.  She falls down the steps, and her stupid slippers are upstairs, and all the men keep drinking  while she lays there with a blackened eye and a lesson well learned.  Know why I'm mad?  Why, sweetie?  That ends the goofing on Mantown bit.  Yeah, it's pretty much over.  That's it.  We can't do anything else with the Mantown thing after that. 
[01:54:00]  It's reached its pinnacle.  So now we need another show to goof on.  Yeah.  We already beat up that show in West Palm Beach.  Those guys are ferocious.  Oh, the number one rated, um, Keith, was it?  Ken?  No, Kevin in Virginia.  I say.  Kevin in Virginia.  I say, hello, Preston and Steve.  We're coming to get you.  And Ron and Fez, you're in Philly.  Wait a minute.  Yeah, that Ron and Fez.  Hey, Fez.  We'll show them.  Hey, Fez.  Preston and Steve. 
[01:54:30]  All right.  He scares me.  You're next.  Bob Kelly at Caroline's all weekend long here in New York City.  What?  You scare me when you turn into that guy.  What guy?  That black ninja guy.  Yeah, look out.  I don't like when he yells like that.  He's like a cloud of smoke and he appears.  Makes me sad.  My acting lessons have paid off.  It's pretty good.  I'm just an actor.  Yeah.  You and Jimmy, you should both be on a show together.  I don't like when he's like that. 
[01:55:00]  Frank?  Is it Frank the Frowner?  I don't like.  You make me sad when you treat me like that.  Oh, he's very quiet today.  Bob, have you met Frank the Frowner yet?  I actually wasn't fully introduced.  Hey, how are you, Frank?  Oh, shut up.  Oh, jeez.  You talk to me like I'm a character, you man-town thing.  What happened?  I think he heard his voice yesterday.  What happened to Frank the Frowner's voice?  Again, I'm just a little bit sad. 
[01:55:30]  Do I have to shout again?  Bob, this is Frank the Frowner.  Hi, Frank.  How are you doing?  Hi, Bob.  Thanks for coming.  I hear you are a real smash at Caroline's.  Are you going to go see Bob Kelly at Caroline's?  I'm certainly not.  Why not?  I'm watching Lucky Louie on Sunday.  That makes me Frank the Frowner, who does the headstand and smiles.  Actually, I have a show on right after Lucky Louie, Frank.  Maybe you want to tour again?  I certainly don't.  I'm going to watch Lucky Louie twice. 
[01:56:00]  You know, it takes more muscles to frown than it does to smile.  I was once told by a disingenuous, a lot of shortstop.  Thank you, Frank the Frowner.  All right, well.  I love him. 
[01:56:30]  We only have one more break, and then we've got to leave here.  Yeah.  Hey, what happened to the show today?  We had a great show, but it flew by like that.  It went very quickly with the hilarity of last night's shenanigans over there at the charity event.  Well, when we come back, one of our favorite things.  News teases?  Death at Disney.  Oh, another one.  Bites the dust at Disney.  It's an epidemic at this point.  Oh, God.  Places like cigarettes.  Well, we'll talk about death at Disney next. 
[01:57:00]  It's the ONA virus.  Yes, Frank?  Oh, no, no, no.  I was just wanting to just point out that I'm sick of the Japanese prime minister and his stupid Prince Valiant hairdo.  Oh, him and Bush sitting there.  You know they can't talk to each other, and they just awkwardly sit.  What's that dopey table at the White House where there's this little round table and two chairs,  and they sit to make it look like they're chatting with each other comfortably,  and it's the most uncomfortable-looking scenario ever? 
[01:57:30]  I have one of those.  I got a sharper image.  You do not.  On the airplanes in that magazine, the mall, the air mall.  Air mall, yeah.  All useless stuff.  It's overpriced.  It's called the conversation table.  Conversation table.  And you have two chairs.  Yeah.  And the table.  Yes.  Have you ever used them and conversed with anybody there?  Anybody that comes to my house, I actually.  Does your little dog go up on a chair and you talk to him?  I actually have a dog for me and a dog for my guest, so we both have dogs.  It's certainly a fine place to converse about world issues. 
[01:58:00]  Thank you, Frank the Prowner.  Frank, you can barely get your eyes open today, I see.  That's because I'm talking whenever I wish they'd open wine.  Yeah, they do.  Yeah, we see that.  And he can only frown.  That is, I can't help it whenever I whisper my eyes just open wide, like a boy eagerly discovering  the world.  But whenever I get excited, they close like a feasting shark.  And you spit a lot.  I can't help it.  My mouth doesn't close properly because my mother drank during pregnancy and fell down 
[01:58:30]  the stairs, according to the doctors.  Frank, you should go see Bob Kelly.  Maybe you'll smile.  I certainly won't.  I'm T-Boy and Lucky Lily.  But maybe you'll smile for the first time.  I like Bob Kelly when I watch you.  I smile on the inside.  What about smiling on the outside for Bob?  I can't.  He's a fatso.  I lost some weight.  I lost a little weight.  I look a little better, Jim.  You know?  Frank.  Don't confuse my name again, you third world terror downer. 
[01:59:00]  I meant third world.  Third world.  Third world.  Even Frank makes little verbal slips.  That's a little verbal thing I have.  Is that a muscular or a nerve thing that keeps you from smiling?  The doctors aren't sure, but in high school I was voted most likely to be misinterpreted  as sad when he's happy.  Pretty accurate?  Okay.  He actually spit on me the other day when I met him.  I said, we're not intentional.  I apologize. 
[01:59:30]  I want that tomato you live with to give me a bikini waxing.  She's lovely.  A tomato.  You call her tomato, Frank?  She's a very sexy girl.  Hey, Frank, you know it takes, you know.  I'm not sure what she...  What do you need to be?  His eyes open.  He whispered and his eyes just like...  Hey, Frank the Father, do you like the Yankees?  I am not a Yankee fan at all.  I don't think they're very nice people. 
[02:00:00]  I like athletes that hug me.  I want to meet Gale Sayers.  And Brian Piccolo.  I want Brian Piccolo to hug me in a coffin.  Brian's song, it was tapped.  Goodbye, stupid.  Yeah.  Is there anything else you want to say? 
[02:00:30]  No, I just don't...  I was...  I want to be a happy boy, but it takes more muscles to frown than it does to smile.  A man once told me, through a glory call written on his helmet.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  Emanating from the center of my toilet, I've been sitting here for an hour.  Strains.  Struggle.  Splash.  My legs have fallen asleep.  What day is it?  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:01:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Bob Kelly in studio today.  He's playing Caroline's New York City all weekend long.  If you're looking for something to do.  A very funny guy.  He's been hanging with Dane Cook for many years.  And he more than holds his own in front of Dane Cook's audience. 
[02:01:30]  Cook's is...  Cook's is...  I know, I got a little stuck there.  Hey, let's say hi to Barbara in Yonkers.  Barbara.  They're coming for you, Barbara.  What's up, Barbara?  Hey, I just want to tell Frank the Frowner that if he wants to hug celebrities and athletes  that'll hug him back, he should go to the Special Olympics.  But I don't need to be in the Special Olympics.  I'm not retarded, you idiot.  He just has a...  I just look sad. 
[02:02:00]  I'm just a hole.  No, you're not, Barbara.  Yes, she certainly is, hope sir.  All right, Barbara.  Have a good weekend.  Punch an ass.  All right.  You want a little death at Disney?  Yeah, another one, huh?  Another one.  At the happiest place on Earth.  That's right.  Ladies and gentlemen, this ride will be closed while we hose it down and restart it later.  Thank you.  We apologize for any inconvenience or death.  All right, tragedy at the Magic Kingdom. 
[02:02:30]  There was a 12-year-old boy who died on a Disney ride.  Right now, investigators, they want to know why.  Michael Russell of Kentucky was riding the Rockin' Roller Coaster on Thursday.  That's when he passed out and he was rushed to the hospital and he died.  An autopsy is pending right now.  Michael is the ninth person to die at Disney World since 2003.  A little boy passed out on the train.  Is he still unconscious and is he breathing?  Is he still unconscious or is he breathing?  He's still unconscious right now.  Right now, our deepest sympathies are with the family and we are doing everything we can do to assist them. 
[02:03:00]  Disney officials say the ride was operating normally.  Michael's parents say he was a healthy child.  Well, you don't know.  That means they're going to have to slow down the ride.  So he was a healthy child.  He would have been fine.  He only had one of those congenital heart defects.  Something was going on there.  Yeah.  Guess where I'm going this weekend.  Personality class?  It's nice knowing you.  Kenny picked me up this morning all nervous because he's going down to Disney after the show today. 
[02:03:30]  So don't go on the rock and roller coaster or that mission for your space ride.  I just want to say goodbye now to everyone.  Do you go on rides?  I'm taking my 14-year-old son, so he's going to make me do everything.  You know, that goes against me like rat poison.  Just you two?  Or the whole family?  No, my wife also.  Oh, okay.  So have them go.  You just don't go on any of the rides.  No, me and my son got to do a thing. 
[02:04:00]  Go on like it's a small world.  We got to do a thing, man.  Get some cotton candy and sit in front of the teacups like a pervert.  Yeah.  Let's do that.  Although the teacups are very nauseating.  I'll try to squeeze that into my schedule.  Is Jeff going or no?  No, the big guy is doing his thing.  Yeah, he doesn't want to hang out with Dad anymore.  Yeah.  He's 18.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That would be awful going with your parents at Disneyland when you're 18.  You want to just bang chicks all weekend.  I know.  You're going to look at your dad going, be careful because Goofy once said, all right? 
[02:04:30]  You know this oaf is going to get on a roller coaster and his head is going to hit a beam.  And he's going to be fine.  And he won't be affected.  Yeah.  He's going to say roller coaster damage.  Yeah, right.  Ten killed people behind him when his car kept going.  And they flew off the rail.  Let's go on it again.  That was fun.  You know, was your head supposed to hit the water?  And he'll just run through the door like Herman Munster having no idea what he's just caused.  That's kind of a ruckus.  I got bad equilibrium when it comes to the rides. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, you do?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm not good like that.  You go on things like Pirates of the Caribbean.  There, that's a nice, easy, gentle ride.  Yeah.  Yo-ho, yo-ho.  Why don't you just go on?  I'm a big dummy.  Well, how about it's a small chin after all?  It's going to bumper cars.  You can scrape your head along the electricity on the top.  The Matterhorn boob head. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, boy.  Have fun down there, Kenny.  All right.  I wish everybody else a nice vacation also.  Ah, turn his mic off.  When do you come back?  Wednesday.  Tuesday.  Okay.  On the 4th?  Yes.  Don't forget the plans and the canoe on the island.  What's that?  Oh, Tom Sawyer Island?  Yeah, I remember Tom Sawyer Island.  He'll have no problem addressing Jim.  Oh, that's Huck Finn.  Sorry.  Either way, it still fits.  We don't call him that anymore, Ken.  I do. 
[02:06:00]  That was the good old days.  When you can get on a raft and go down the river with a slave.  I'm glad they glorify that at Disney with its own little island.  The Onga Boonga ride?  Where nothing counts.  There's no rules or laws on that little island.  Just like the old days.  All right.  Hey, we got something we can play just before we get out of here. 
[02:06:30]  Jay Leno had something really funny last night.  He was doing 911 calls.  Anyone see this?  I did not.  Anyone seen this?  No.  Danny?  You want to explain that?  Danny?  Really fast.  Really fast.  We're running out of time here.  Danny?  He basically just does a segment where he just tools on bad 911 calls and also dash cam video.  Shut up.  And they're real calls, right?  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  These are actual 911 calls.  Cool.  Listen to this.  Hey, question.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:07:00]  I urinate in the sink.  And my wife got mad at me.  Is there anything wrong about that?  Well, as far as the police is concerned, it's okay.  But I can understand her kind of getting upset about it.  Yeah.  It's okay, isn't it?  Well, where's she going to wear stases at?  In the toilet?  I should explain ahead of time, obviously.  A guy calls 911 to see if taking a leak in the sink is okay.  Yeah.  In your own house? 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  He was completely hammered.  He wanted to make sure it was okay.  And he called 911.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's wonderful.  Good.  Somebody's dropping dead, and this guy's tying up one of the lines.  All right.  That worked well.  Well, uh...  A woman calls 911 because her pig is choking.  Yes, I have an emergency.  What?  My pig.  She's choked, and she's passed out, and I don't know what to do for her.  Okay.  Did you try to drain a brim with her?  No, I haven't.  Did you just kick her up off the floor?  Yeah. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  Maybe stand her up on her hind legs?  Okay.  If your pig is choking...  Yes.  Do what you're supposed to do when a pig is choking.  Grab it by the hair and pull it up and go, all right, take a breath.  Maybe stand her up on her hind legs?  Okay.  And get your hands around her.  Uh-huh.  And make a kiss.  Uh-huh.  Put it up right between her ribs.  Okay, I'm going to do that.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  She's giving the hind leg to a pig. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, you're going to get out?  She's okay.  She's okay.  Okay.  She's going to the bathroom?  Oh, thank you.  Wow.  Oh.  Thank you so much.  Oh, you're welcome.  I really appreciate it.  Okay.  Wonderful.  These poor 911 operators.  Same thing that happens when you hug a fat girl.  Robert Reed T-Cell is checking in.  Hey, Kenny, when are you going to enter the park at 4.55?  4.55, they're not open that early. 
[02:09:00]  I hope it's closed down and you have to pull out your weapon and make the guy bring you on rides.  Orange whip.  Orange whip.  Orange whip.  Orange whip.  You want to be right, guy?  Orange whip.  Orange whip.  Orange whip.  Three orange whips.  All right.  And finally, a woman calls 911 because she thinks the guy she's having sex with in her car broke his...  Yes.  Wow.  Leno bleeped out that word.  Okay, good.  It wasn't us.  Leno bleeped it out because the XM Nation gets pissed off at anything that's bleeped. 
[02:09:30]  We didn't bleep it, guys, although we would because we don't need you hearing it.  Jeez.  Golden 911, what's your emergency?  I'm in a car.  We were making for him and I think he broke his...  Where are you at?  I'm on Washington heading towards the FDA.  Okay, is he complaining of a neck pain?  No, neck.  Oh, his f***.  Oh, my God.  I will just come in and park and we'll get an ambulance right over, okay? 
[02:10:00]  Neck.  Complaining a neck pain.  Oh, wow.  Sometimes you watch some of those what you call porno movies and they get a little too  rambunctious and you see like a nice, you know, like a nice piston in a cylinder of an  engine, how it's supposed to go.  And then at some point, the connecting rod bends and... 
[02:10:30]  It's like an elbow.  Yeah, like an elbow.  You're laying there, oh, oh, hold my hand.  And everyone in the room goes, oh, oh, rewind that.  By the way, once we get over to XM, I'm going to describe my massage recently.  Yeah.  And the position I was in and how fantastic the bend was.  Very good.  You had a good bend?  You have no idea.  By the way, I got to plug my buddy, Bob Kelly.  Really a funny dude. 
[02:11:00]  Disgusting human being, but very funny.  Tonight and tomorrow, Caroline, do you start Sunday too?  Holiday weekend, go check out the revolting, the funny Bob Kelly, 212-757-4100.  You will not be disappointed.  I hope a lot of O&A pass you up and support Bob Kelly, definitely.  You break your leg this week, I think, on Tourgasm, on After Lucky Louie, on After  On The Rise.  Watch that too.  And don't forget who's going to be with me on this show.  What's her name?  Caroline.  Jay Davis.  What's his name?  Jay, uh... 
[02:11:30]  Jay...  You're kidding, right?  Right.  What time do you go on stage?  Uh...  All right.  I'm going to be there.  Good for you.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there, Bob.  Steve's seen Jay's act.  Yeah.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  I know.  They're wrapping up over at XM.  We're going to continue on XM in a few minutes.  If you're not joining us, have a great weekend.  I did want to say Jay Leno's still doing some great edgy stuff, by the way.  Of course he is.  We had to cut that bit a little short.  Unfortunately, we ran out of time.  Have a great weekend, man.  We'll be right back. 
[02:12:00]  Hey. 
[02:12:30]  We're out front where we're not supposed to be standing.  We're on the breezeway.  Breezeway.  You know what's cool?  A lot of people are out here for the walk today.  Yes.  Did we promise we were going to give stuff away?  I don't know why they're here.  I don't think we did.  Where's Bobby's microphone?  Bob, where's your microphone?  Hey there, Bab.  Bob Kelly, everyone.  Bob Kelly, the star of Torgasm on HBO Sunday nights at, uh, I forgot what time because I  got, uh, the whole season on DVD already. 
[02:13:00]  You?  Yeah.  I don't even watch it.  I've already seen the whole freaking season.  I'll tell you what, like I'm not a star.  And I can't even get this to my own show on DVD.  That sucks.  I already saw you break your knee, man.  I've seen it already.  It's hilarious.  Look at Michael Moore over to your left.  No, keep looking around.  Who's this guy?  I'll be the other way.  Look around the other way.  No, no, no.  You keep missing it.  Ugh.  Ugh.  What? 
[02:13:30]  Ugh.  I know.  Shouldn't you be ringing, shouldn't, shouldn't you be ringing a bell on a small island?  Oh, there he goes.  He's going to go get us in trouble.  Oh, he's not his walkie-talkie.  This could be bad.  Oh, shut your little face.  Go fuck yourself.  You're the one that wouldn't let me sit to put my, uh, rollerblades on.  Yeah, you fat midget.  Shut up.  Oh, boy.  That's the guy, by the way.  I know it was.  That's the roly-poly goose.  That fat head.  He has a midget head.  Do you have dwarfism or Down syndrome, sir?  He ran.  He was like, okay. 
[02:14:00]  All right.  He's had enough of your guff.  Exactly.  That's what a real man does.  He fucking runs away.  And now we're in trouble.  Great.  No, we're not.  Great.  Oh, that, um.  Yeah, I think we're evicted from that building.  Who cares?  Now Tom's got a problem.  Yeah, Tom's going to have to deal with our shit.  No, we stood there for 30 seconds.  With our shit.  Yeah.  Tom's going to...  What's up, bro?  Clear the sidewalk.  Clear the sidewalk, you mutants.  Goddamn human beings.  Oh. 
[02:14:30]  I would like to talk to somebody.  I can't wait until I get back to my home planet and don't have to deal with this species  anymore.  I want to interview somebody about something.  Oh, Frank the Frowner, everyone.  Frank the Frowner's here.  I have to find out some information.  Turn around and show...  Why?  I will when I'm talking.  I'm very self-conscious and shy.  All right.  All right.  Enough of that fucking camera before I smash it.  Frank the Frowner's in the front of the crowd here.  He's going to turn around and interview someone.  I'm doing interviews on the street.  Would you talk to us for a second? 
[02:15:00]  It's about older ladies.  Frank the Frowner.  Getting blown off again.  I love Frank the Frowner.  Oh, look.  Excuse me.  Yogi Barrett-Less Down Syndrome.  I'm sorry, sir.  You fathead.  Excuse me.  Can I interview you for the radio?  My name's Frank and I have AIDS.  Frank.  Frank, you're not having much luck.  Nobody will talk to me.  Frank cannot get an interview.  How are you, sir? 
[02:15:30]  You know what's great about Frank the Frowner?  I'm very good.  Congratulations on getting OJ off.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, he's dead.  You know what's great about Frank the Frowner?  Everyone where...  Excuse me.  Extra from a Spike Lee movie.  Can I interview you?  Dude, everyone that's walking toward us, they're all frowning.  Yeah.  So this is perfect.  None of these people want us.  I saw your trip, lady.  Oh.  She didn't want anybody to think we saw that. 
[02:16:00]  Are you still mad at Barbara Walters?  Oh, it just got sunny.  Yeah, it's nice.  Ugh.  Some more people are out.  Do-do-do-do-do-do.  Do.  Yeah.  Miss, you dropped something.  Fucking cunt.  You're femininity.  God bless her. 
[02:16:30]  Eh.  Another woman handing out pamphlets.  Who takes those?  You certainly can't.  You got a camera?  All right.  Jimmy, you better take every picture today.  Yeah, I know, right?  Even if I come here and start with me to make out pictures this way.  You fucking hypocrite.  You better take every picture.  Thanks a lot, man.  Sign everything, really.  Thanks, buddy.  What we should do, we should set it up where like a thousand listeners show up and they 
[02:17:00]  all want Jimmy pictures.  I'll take them, too.  I don't mind.  Signing things and everything else.  Hi, Patty.  All right.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Uh-huh.  I just saw Anthony blow a girl off of-  No, I don't have to say.  I don't have to take a picture with anybody.  With who?  A chick.  A chick?  Hi.  Oh, that broad.  No, of course.  I take pictures with anybody except Jimmy Norton.  He's abrasive, and I would turn him down. 
[02:17:30]  Hi, I'll put my microphone up like we're talking.  Like you're a professional broadcaster.  Like you're interviewing her.  Yes.  Oh, and Jimmy, please.  All right.  Oh, thank you.  I know you're a drowning boy, but thank you.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Stared right down at the last minute.  Good photo.  Oh, my God.  Look at the fat load of shit waiting at the bus stop.  Oh, with a cigarette, too.  Yeah.  Wonderful. 
[02:18:00]  Wow.  Oh.  Where are you from?  Australia, right?  Where?  Denmark.  Denmark.  Hi, Denmarkians.  Welcome to New York.  Have you seen anything cool in New York?  New York yet?  What?  Have you seen anything cool in New York yet?  Yeah.  Really?  The Statue of Liberty and...  Empire State Building?  Statue of Liberty.  Yeah.  Things like that.  Okay.  Time Square.  Statue.  Time Square?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Ever see...  You see homeless people? 
[02:18:30]  What?  You see any homeless people?  Yeah.  Yeah, you just kind of got to step over them, right?  Yeah.  Well, welcome.  There's one over there.  His name is Mac.  Um, don't go near him.  Okay, I won't.  He's kind of like...  He stinks a little bit.  In our country, it's okay to throw eggs at them.  Okay.  Yeah.  Have fun.  How old are you?  How old are you?  14.  Oh.  Have a nice trip.  Have a nice trip.  Enjoy your shelter there.  They know she's cute as a button.  Yes, sir.  We're checking out your hot piece of head. 
[02:19:00]  Do you want to do some film work, do you?  Jesus.  I want to fuck Hansel and Gretel.  I'm going to lay breadcrumbs down to follow me up to XM Studios.  What is it with the foreign children that are so, um...  I don't know.  What's the word I'm looking for?  Enticing.  Now you have to ask how old are you.  Oh, Jesus.  What?  I hope he's micing that fat broad's ass.  Oh, my God.  Hey, wait.  Photo op.  Photo op.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, quick. 
[02:19:30]  Opie and Anthony are taking their photos in front of their own picture on the side of the bus.  Yeah, we're on the bus.  Don't you complain.  Don't complain.  We're on the side of your bus, sir.  This bus can wait as long as possible.  Wait.  Wow.  I want to be in the ad.  Can you get a picture of me in the ad?  Are you late?  Okay.  Like it's the real ad.  All right.  Yeah, it's Jimmy's leaning on the bus. 
[02:20:00]  Wouldn't that be funny if Jimmy got killed by a bus with our pictures on it?  Yes.  Bye.  Look at grumpy lady with red hair.  What the fuck is that about?  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  All right.  How cool is that?  That was fun.  How cool is that?  That's right.  Who's this disaster in the green shirt?  Hey, Tim Sabian made the walk today.  Thanks, Tim.  I can only hope that if a bus has to run over people, it's one with our pictures on it so  it makes the papers. 
[02:20:30]  Wouldn't that be great?  Who's Hoist Gracie?  Broad sides of school bus.  Who's Hoist Gracie with the walkie-talkie right here?  Who's this guy?  Yeah, that guy looks like he would be a problem.  Is he with us?  He's a fan.  Thank God he's a fan.  All right.  Good.  All right.  Good.  What's up?  I'm a ham radio operator.  Are you really?  Fuck.  We use digital radios and stuff now.  We don't use analog anymore.  A ham radio operator.  A ham radio operator?  I like turkey radio myself.  Ha ha.  Oh, that's another country t-shirt.  All right. 
[02:21:00]  That's wonderful.  Are we done out here?  Anybody else have anything?  What is Michael Moore working on?  Oh, the lovely girls?  I don't bother them.  All right.  I guess we're done.  Any more conspiracy movies?  He's snapping pictures.  That's wonderful.  One photo?  Oh, excuse that woman, Big Kev.  There she didn't.  Wait, miss?  You dropped something.  Hi, fella.  Who's taking the picture?  Where are you?  All right.  Nice camera.  One.  It's up in here.  Oh, my God.  Look at the camera he's got.  That thing there.  It's cardboard. 
[02:21:30]  All right.  Very good.  Thank you.  All right.  Come on here.  Jump in, sociopath.  You're like Michael Moore, right?  Yeah.  There it is.  What the hell?  All right.  You're Michael less.  See, because, well.  Oh, God.  Patty, that body.  Your hips are getting wider by the day.  By the day.  Oh, God.  And she's trying to wear sexy little panties.  What the hell is that?  Little shorts today.  Those shorts are awful.  What is that?  What hippie did you steal those off of? 
[02:22:00]  Do you realize you're getting, like, very hippie?  Your hips are getting, like, wider and wider.  It looks like it.  Oh.  And dye your hair.  You got, like, gray pubes growing out of your scalp.  Hey, you want to go out this weekend and kill a coffee heiress?  All right.  Let's, uh.  We got to go.  What?  What happened?  Oh.  What happened?  Oh, Frank wants to, yeah, interview that lady.  She wants to know why.  He's right here, man. 
[02:22:30]  Miss.  Miss, we're doing an interview.  Miss.  Miss.  Miss.  Miss.  She can't be bothered.  All right.  We're trying to do an interview.  Miss, we're doing interviews for the radio about New Yorkers.  Would you talk to me?  Miss.  She's laughing at me.  Miss.  She's totally laughing at him.  And I can't even yell at her.  She's young.  Pat from Monaki parking illegally again.  Ladies and gentlemen, Pat from Monaki.  There he is.  And the Coney Island hot dog eating contest.  Look at those awful fucking legs. 
[02:23:00]  What the hell's going on with your legs?  I know.  Old cancer patient legs.  He's got diabetes.  Ugh.  Hold on.  Let's get that.  So, fuck.  How about running a donut?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  No.  Oh, my God.  I just saw something that'll stay with me for the rest of my life.  What?  Unfortunately.  Wait, wait.  Show Jimmy.  Show Jimmy.  What?  Show Jimmy.  Show Jimmy right there.  Put something in there.  On three.  Photo op.  One, two, three. 
[02:23:30]  Oh.  If that didn't look like the back of an elephant.  Aren't you glad you have that Breathe Right strip on?  It looked like the back and front of an elephant.  All right, guys.  We got to broadcast some more.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you.  Thanks a lot, everybody.  Have a great weekend.  Nice.  Nice crowd.  Nice crowd out there today.  Yes.  Very pleasant.  Where are you, Ant?  It's right here.  Oh, no.  I'm here.  All right.  I'm on my way in.  Dump her on that one.  All right.  We're... 
[02:24:00]  I don't mind her using my mouth as a trolley.  Shit her.  Shit her.  You know the roly-poly douche is going to cause a major...  No, he's not.  There's no problem.  We'll be there for 30 seconds.  I don't want a middle-of-vacation phone call.  I'm so glad I was able to confront him.  These work in the elevator?  No.  We're at the elevators.  It's got to be funny because...  We're out.  Jimmy's really bad in the elevator.  Oh, excuse me.  Please.  Oh, boy.  I'll wait for the next elevator. 
[02:24:30]  Jimmy, as Frank the Frowner and Anthony in the elevator,  they're going to have some great stories in a few minutes.  The rest of us are waiting for the next elevator up.  All right.  We'll continue in a few minutes.  Opie and Anthony, XM202.  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony are about to make their return to the airwaves.  Opie and Anthony were pulled from the airwaves two years ago  after a sex stunt at St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Opie and Anthony are back,  so why won't the SEC be able to touch them this time? 
[02:25:00]  The duo has signed with XM Satellite Radio.  Their contract with Infinity expired back in May,  but the no-compete portion is up until October.  No arrests have been made.  Police are still investigating.  We're calling!  We're calling!  Let's do it!  The blonde one, uh,  some so-called radio shots.  Our society needs borders.  It needs parameters.  You dick!  They get their dollies by saying,  let's keep pushing the envelope.  They were doing what they were paid to do. 
[02:25:30]  Even when there are bucks to be made,  there's a price to be paid in terms of the cultural degradation  that we do not want to be associated with anymore.  Are you adequately prepared to rock, rock, rock?  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[02:26:00]  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Opie, uh, once again, evading,  being on the elevator with Jimmy.  That's my new thing.  I can't deal.  I love it.  I really can't deal anymore.  I've grown to love it.  What do you do?  He gave, uh, he was doing, uh, Frank the Frowner, 
[02:26:30]  and he very loudly announced that it takes more muscles to frown  than it does to smile.  And he learned that when some guy was using his face as a pocket pussy.  He did not do that.  Oh, he did.  Oh, he did.  And as the door was shutting, I heard the woman in the elevator saying something  about, uh, the experience there.  Wow.  And by the way, if that little douchebag over at the other building wants to make a problem, 
[02:27:00]  we were there for 30 seconds and moving the line along,  and he came over and started going, you gotta move, you gotta move.  He's a fucking prick.  What a wannabe somebody.  That's the guy.  I knew it.  I knew it.  We hate his guts.  And we all laughed at him.  We moved.  We laughed at him.  Oh, he said, all right, fine.  And he got so pissed off, he turned around and went right for his walkie-talkie.  And like, yeah, ran to get somebody of some authority.  It's going to be a big problem.  Trust me.  Did he swear at you?  Did he say fuck off?  No.  No.  We did.  No, I don't know what we said.  I'm not saying anything. 
[02:27:30]  Because I know this one's going to be a problem.  I don't want to get called back from vacation.  That's usually what happens.  Yeah.  Terrestrial radio.  Excuse me, could you come back and have a meeting with this person?  We won't have a studio to broadcast from when we get back.  Dude, I was getting a massage recently.  Oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  This is what you teased, right?  Yeah, man.  All right, cool.  Let's get ready for the heart.  And I like to look at Anthony.  Yeah, get that mic out of the way.  Do you like looking at me? 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  I do.  Except when you yell, it scares me.  Thank you, Kenny.  Can I, I want a smoothie, but I want, what did I get one day?  You get usually banana.  I want banana, pineapple, strawberry.  Strawberry.  Pineapple, strawberry, banana.  Don't say strawberry.  That's the way I say it.  No, no.  Pineapple, banana, strawberry.  No, no, no.  I got the whole blueberry and strawberry thing from my brother.  You say strawberry.  It's the same fucking thing every day. 
[02:28:30]  I want pineapple, strawberry.  This is groundhog day.  And Kenny waits there for an answer, and he knows what it's going to be, because it's  the same fucking thing every day.  You know what, though, Ken?  I think I might want a little snack, just a little smidge.  Smidge?  I'm not sure what I should get.  What do you think I should have?  Does Frank want anything?  Is there anything enough about Frank?  Good setup.  Yeah, that was good.  No, Frank doesn't want anything.  No.  No.  Was I going to lapse into a 20-minute Frank?  You said it.  No, here's what Frank wants, to not be played out. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah, we want to ride that a little bit.  Thanks, Kenny, for helping that out.  GH, anything?  He seems to already be crunching away on something nutritious.  Well, he's eating blueberries.  I don't want blueberries.  Are they?  You say blueberries.  Yeah, blueberries.  Blueberries are awful.  I love blueberries.  They're awful, tart, crunchy things.  I like blueberries.  I like soft fruit.  Like a cantaloupe.  Like a cantaloupe.  Or a honeydew.  You can't get a cantaloupe smoothie. 
[02:29:30]  That's disgusting.  Fuck, hold on.  Just egg whites.  No?  All right, hold on.  Let's go to Eli from Brooklyn.  That would be disgusting.  Eli.  Anthony, Anthony, I think you need a car crash yourself.  For what joke?  I said a few out there.  Turkey, radio.  Absolutely good point, sir.  The guy said he was a ham radio operator.  I said, well, I'm a turkey radio operator.  Okay.  I'm always one to do stuff a crash, even though none of my templates are out, and I don't 
[02:30:00]  know where they are, but I know where the crash is.  Why would they be out?  Why would they?  Why would they?  Let's go to Arik and Bethlehem.  That deserves a fucking gobble and a car crash.  Thank you.  I was just calling to give Jimmy props on a line that nobody seemed to get that he said  to Patty about the Abigail Folger.  Oh, thanks, buddy.  Oh, wow.  They were calling her a hippie, so.  Fantastic.  Thank you, man.  How many Manson references do you get in a week, let alone one morning with Jimmy?  Wow.  Thank you, man.  Eric.  Yes.  Oh, well, I was...  He actually meant, not you, the good caller. 
[02:30:30]  He meant Hawk, the incompetent.  No, Eric, seriously.  And now Eric thinks I'm goofing on him.  He has no idea that it got confusing because we're talking to Eric on the line, too.  Well, I just want the pictures up of us in front of our own bus.  That was kind of cool.  Yes.  All right.  So, this story, Jimmy.  I got a massage from this girl.  I don't know if I told this right.  And she's massaging me.  And she's, like, teasing my balls, and it was really sexy.  And she's rubbing my ass really light. 
[02:31:00]  And she goes, get up on your hands and knees.  So, I got up on my hands and knees.  And she starts calling my cock a meat pole.  Dude.  Fucking.  She milked me like a fucking farm animal.  I'm on my hands and knees.  And she takes my cock and pulls it back behind my balls, facing her.  Ow.  No.  Ow.  Ooh.  That's a little rough.  And she starts, you know, it was gentle.  She starts yanking it towards her.  Where did she come up with that fucking movie? 
[02:31:30]  Tranny movies.  Whatever it was.  What do they do to trannies?  Take it from the back and suck it from behind.  She didn't suck it.  She spit on it.  So, the nose is in your asshole?  Dude.  Maybe if your cock is small.  Jesus, dude.  Am I Asian?  No.  You never seen a girl.  Oh.  So, you take it from the front.  No.  Now I got a rebut.  You're on all fours.  You're on all fours.  She takes your dick and now bends it between your legs, doing what amounts to a tuck move  with a heart on.  And you're saying it's still so much hanging out the back that she can't suck it and have 
[02:32:00]  her nose in your asshole?  I agree with Anthony.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  You're losing like four inches.  Yeah, you're losing just from the fucking thigh area that it's got to go through.  Well, okay.  So, if you're losing four inches and she's sucking, what do you think?  Say I'm packing around seven, maybe a little bit more?  Maybe?  Yeah.  She could still put it down so her nose is in your asshole.  All right, perhaps.  It's at least close enough.  But she wasn't sucking it.  She was spitting on it.  And she was fucking going, get that nice fucking, she was calling it a meat pole and a fucking 
[02:32:30]  meat pole.  A meat pole.  I definitely want that.  And a meat pole.  You want a meat pole?  Oh, no.  Oh, you were missing that conversation.  Hold on.  I'm fucking Steve.  No, you weren't.  Steve, get your ass back here.  Give me a seat.  She was calling it a meat pole and Opie said, I gotta have that.  I want one.  I want one.  Give me that fucking post-it.  Give me it.  That was uncomfortable.  Somebody quit getting a meat pole.  It really was.  It made me feel weird.  You know there's a million things going on while you guys are talking about that.  Give me the fucking post-it to save my ass. 
[02:33:00]  Thank you.  Save your ass.  With a meat pole?  They hand me a post-it.  Do you want audio of Frank the Frowner in the elevator?  Sam was taping.  And that's when I said what I said.  Wow.  Right, Steve?  Indeed, yeah.  He said, I want a meat pole first, then get me the audio.  Save my ass.  We're going through that audio right now.  Dude, she's fucking jerking me like that.  She's spitting into my asshole, spitting on my dick, calling it a meat pole and a meat  stick.  What a disgusting whore. 
[02:33:30]  How are you spitting in your asshole?  What is that there?  What is she going to do?  Talk to it?  But if she's spitting in it, was she rubbing it?  Yeah, a little bit.  There you go.  Let's get into that.  Yeah, it's hot.  She was spitting in it to lube it up a little bit to get a finger in it.  And also, just because she liked it.  No, she didn't put a finger in it.  She just rubbed.  I don't want a finger in it.  Just spitting on it.  And just spit on my dick, like angry.  She was angry.  Oh, dude.  She didn't get a photo of Jita?  Shit for money.  You dirty asshole.  Take a picture with me.  She was mad.  Oh, that's crazy.  And then, like, from behind, what, did you propel yourself into the wall when you came? 
[02:34:00]  Oh, rocket ass.  Fucking rocket cock.  No.  My cock says acme on it.  She's got roller skates on.  And ski poles.  Oh, she fucking...  She's got a slingshot cock.  It was hot.  Was it?  It was hot.  Fuck yeah, dude.  Where did you get it?  Can I ask where you got it, Craig's?  Well, you had to treat yourself to awfulness after what happened at the dirt.  Boy, it wasn't yesterday.  You ever have that move done to you before? 
[02:34:30]  The backwards jerk off?  No.  No, because with a regular chick, I've driven on my hand and knees on my ass in the air.  Vulnerable.  I mean, with a hooker.  No.  You don't tell her, you know, you don't tell hookers what to do.  You just hope on their own expertise.  You're not like, hey, I'm going to get on all fours.  Can you pull my cock between your legs and jerk me off so I come out your ass like a fucking bee?  Well, part of the turn on is...  Jesus.  The guy looks like a fucking bumblebee.  You, with a stinger out your ass.  She's tugging on it.  Fat stomach. 
[02:35:00]  I was wearing a black and yellow shirt.  It's funny if you had like a silk robe on and it was half undone.  He will.  Just one tit hanging out.  Cup of broth.  I was like Ursula Andress.  Old school.  I like.  Dude, it was hot because she thought of it.  I think Bobby knows what I'm going to say.  Because she thought of it.  It was her thing.  She's like, yeah, up on your hands and knees.  Yeah, that's part of the turn on is to almost pretend like you've never done this before.  Wow.  She was sexy.  You just never, ever done it before and you're just like vulnerable. 
[02:35:30]  Like, come here.  Move.  And you're like, okay.  Like, you're nervous and you're like, you know, it's almost, any time a girl, have you  done this before?  I, I lie.  I would lie.  I don't do it anymore because they have a fiance.  But I would lie and be like, I've met, this is my first time being with a, you know.  And then, you know, halfway through I'm like, eat that pussy.  Talking about my asshole.  And they're like, apparently you've done this before.  But, yeah.  Jeez.  Sorry.  I've been on all fours.  Great, dude.  I'll call my cock a meat stick.  Can we talk about Pat from Menaki's ass for another minute? 
[02:36:00]  How horrific is that?  We go from, like you said, it looks like, it looked like a, like a big fat woman's vagina  was in front of his, like, asshole.  We're in aerial view of a collapsed circus tent.  Yeah.  Okay.  That described it too.  I would have thrown him if I saw it.  It was very.  Is Pat still around?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Please don't.  It's just an ass dude.  I'll puke if I see it.  It was very, um.  I think you're lying.  Who else thinks Bob Kelly's lying?  I know he's lying.  You're not going to puke if you see Pat from Menaki's ass. 
[02:36:30]  You know what it was?  I have a very weak stomach when it comes to this.  Pat from Menaki, get up here.  There you go.  It was very loose skin.  Is his van still out there?  Hanging there.  So normally where you'd have tight ass surrounding your asshole area where there's not much difference  between taint and top of crack in the ass valley separation.  There seemed to be big loose separation where his asshole is of like fleshy, hanging skin. 
[02:37:00]  Skin.  Skin.  Just dead skin.  Yeah.  I bet it smells like onions and armpit.  Not even that good.  Are we getting Pat?  It wouldn't even smell that good.  Don't get Pat.  I'm sure one of our guys is on top of it.  It's got to be like a dump.  Right, guys?  It smells like a dumpster.  I lose electrolytes.  We're going to call Pat.  No, no, no.  He's not up here.  I won't be able to look at it, dude.  It's just disgusting.  You've got to look at it.  No, I can't look at it.  No, you said you would muke, and I think you're lying. 
[02:37:30]  You've got to see the red legs he's got to a pessimist.  Yeah, what's wrong with his shins?  Does he get kicked in the shins from looking up skirts, dresses, all day?  Diabetic and rosacea or something.  I don't know.  Skirts, dresses.  Sorry.  Dresses, skirts.  He's got nine toes.  I lost him.  He's got what?  Nine toes.  He had to have one cut off because he had diabetes, and it got all infected.  Pat's like an erector set you find.  It's all a couple of parts of him and this is fucked up, but it's fun sometimes.  We're trying to find Pat.  Let's go to Bill in Jersey.  Bill. 
[02:38:00]  Hello, Bill.  Thanks.  Congrats on all your success.  I've got to back Jimmy up with that.  Reach behind kind of jerk off thing.  My wife massages me all the time, and she does that.  It's like, oh, dude, best feeling in the world, man.  Nothing feels like it in the world.  Normal chicks suck.  They don't know how to do that shit, man.  That's why they're like, why do you get massages?  I'm not saying you're a girl, but I'm saying in general, none of them would think to do that.  No chick would say get up on your hands and knees and point your asshole up.  Only a massage chick.  That's why I get them. 
[02:38:30]  I don't get up on my hands and knees.  I'm just laying on my stomach.  It is the best feeling, though.  It is.  It blows away everything.  With the spit and the fingers and stuff.  It's setting up a game of mouth trap.  Here's what she was doing.  I was on my hands and knees, right?  My meat stick's hanging.  Yeah.  And she's playing with my balls.  It's just hanging down my dick.  And she's tickling my balls.  And she's doing this weird thing with my cock.  She's grabbing it and a light feather touch on the head.  It could be the sexiest thing a girl's ever done without blowing me with her hand.  I couldn't believe it felt that good to have your dick just touched. 
[02:39:00]  And you've got to, when you do that, you have to bring it back soft.  So, it's folded back soft.  As you get hard, it's already bent that way.  I was already hard.  I couldn't do it.  You can't bend it.  When it's really hard, you can't bend it.  How are you bending it back that far?  It's got to be soft a little bit.  No, it's not.  Dude, that's like against physics.  That was more down.  He is bent 90 degrees at the hips.  So, that helps.  Yeah, he's already halfway there.  He's not standing up straight. 
[02:39:30]  Are you in Circus Olay?  No, she pulled it back.  What do you call it?  Circus Olay.  Circus Olay?  Yeah, that's that fucking friend.  Olay!  Circus Olay.  What is it called?  Don't even know.  No one acknowledged that he spoke.  I won't even.  It's Circus Olay.  Actually, don't even.  I said Circus Olay.  Don't even talk about it.  Just sheer silence.  You're no Rich Voss, but that was pretty cool.  Just let it play.  Philanthropist.  All right, let's.  Hey, let's say hi to Pat from Minocchi.  Circus Olay.  Pat.  Yeah?  Where are you?  Are you downstairs? 
[02:40:00]  No, I was in the middle of delivery.  I'm like almost at another time.  I'm on 47th and 5th.  Can you come back when you're done?  No.  Yeah, sure.  I'm starting to feel a little self-conscious here.  How long are you going to be?  Pat.  Sure.  Like a half hour or something.  Half hour.  Hurry up, because we're going home early today.  All right.  Yeah, I'm starting to regret that decision to.  We love you, Pat.  No, because I think Bob's lying.  And he said he would puke if he saw your ass.  You know what?  Because I wanted to have something to eat, and I don't want to.  You're lying.  I can't eat.  You're lying.  I can't eat. 
[02:40:30]  Bob's full of turkey.  You're lying.  I can't look at his ass.  Right after the fourth, going on the old Fet Smash diet.  Here's one of the instant feedbacks coming in.  Pat's ass looks like a bulldozer did a U-turn on it.  Ow.  That's a good visual.  Just come as soon as you can, sweetie.  All right.  All right.  All right, bye.  We miss you.  See you later.  Bye.  And then other people are doing that.  You broke my meat pole, man.  You broke my meat pole, dude.  You can't bend it like that.  Oh, my bad.  You can't bend it.  If it's hard first, you can't bend it backwards. 
[02:41:00]  It has to be a little soft.  No, it was bent back, so I was like this.  I'm not even kidding.  I'm on.  All right, here it goes.  I'm like this.  Hang on.  Won't it be her?  We've got to get you on pal talk.  Oh, yeah.  I'm on pal talk.  Of course he is.  I'm on my hands and knees like this.  Yeah.  And my legs are spread.  And you're not fully hard.  Oh, yes, I was.  And I'm like hanging with my fucking meat poles hanging.  And I pushed it back.  As far as you could.  Yeah.  It wasn't bent back into my asshole.  I didn't say I was fucking a circle of life. 
[02:41:30]  I'm not saying it.  I'm not saying it.  I didn't say I was fucking fire hosing myself.  Don't get angry at me while you're in that position, homo.  No.  Fuck you.  Point it down.  I'll fucking come over there and stick my tongue right in your ass, faggot.  Dude, Bob, reach behind me like you're jerking me.  I'll teach you a lesson.  You're a valuable lesson in life, homo.  Bob.  Reach behind me like you're jerking me.  Hang on one second.  Don't do it.  Like that, right?  Like my fucking cock was bent back.  Do we have anything?  Wait a second.  Yeah.  No, not a water bottle.  I don't deserve that kind of credit.  All right. 
[02:42:00]  Take that.  All right.  Wait.  No, no, wait a minute.  You need to put it up front first.  Look at Kenny's walking in, too.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Don't mind this, Kenny.  So like it was like this.  It was fucking, it was pointing down, right?  And she tickled it just a little like this.  She's holding it like that.  And then she bent it back like that.  Like that.  Like that far.  Spitting on my asshole.  And jerked it off.  Yeah, like that.  And you fucking dirty meatball.  She called it a meat stick and a meat pole.  And then she fucking, but she's jerking it like that, eating my ass, too.  No, I'm spitting my ass.  I'm eating it.  Wow.  Can we, can I get a new water? 
[02:42:30]  Looks like there's a lot of homos out there because the Paltalk camera froze right at the  moment.  It crashed.  A lot of people really wanted to see that.  A lot of people wanted to check out.  Of course they did.  A man getting a meat pole tugged.  Jerking off Jim Norton.  That was actually God.  You should see the skeeved look on fucking Mike's face.  Real man's man.  Doesn't bother Kenny.  He doesn't care.  Nah, he's like whatever.  Nothing fazes Kenny.  He's like whatever.  I'm sorry that I missed the beginning.  Kenny asked me every day if I wanted a thing and I never got one.  And today I wanted one.  He didn't ask me. 
[02:43:00]  A smoothie?  Yeah.  I thought you Kenny's a big bottom.  A big bottom?  Yeah, just a big.  Because he likes feet.  He wants a girl to put her tootsies in his face and yell at them.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You like things like that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We got to clarify this.  Okay.  I'm with you, Anthony.  How like everything got to be nice.  One whole nice complete package.  The whole package.  Okay.  Understand?  And feet are part of that.  It doesn't mean that's a fetish.  It means if she's got big fucking eagle talon feet, there's going to be a problem. 
[02:43:30]  Gnarly with corn.  Okay.  Understandable.  But if she's got really pretty nice feet.  How about dainty feet, Ken?  You know, I'm a married man.  If I was single, maybe it'd be a different story.  I'm not talking about...  But I love my wife immensely.  Dainty feet are nice.  I'm not talking about going out and doing things.  I'm talking about just an inner...  Like something you like.  Like even if you're married, you can say, I like nice asses.  It doesn't mean you're going to touch him.  Right.  So you like feet.  Right.  Just because I got no money, I can still go window shopping. 
[02:44:00]  Let's go to Morgan in Idaho.  Morgan.  Hey.  I just wanted to say no homo on behalf of the show.  Thank you, Morgan.  We need you today.  Thanks a lot, buddy.  Let's go to George in Colorado.  Can I have an ibuprofen?  What is all this food that's arriving?  What's this about?  It's probably for honor.  Hey, Jimmy.  Really?  No, no, no.  It's that guy brought it up.  It's from Bagel, that Bagel place.  Really?  Yeah.  That guy over there.  Good.  Little UFC fighter type looking dinner.  Tell no one to touch it. 
[02:44:30]  Bring it in.  Patty's touching it.  Hey, Jimmy.  I'm with you.  I went to an Asian massage place here about a month or so ago.  I had a chick do the exact same thing to me.  And I walked away.  My only thought was, I'm in love and I have to go back as soon as possible.  Yep.  It felt really good.  Wow, the back jack-off is a hit.  It's the best.  It's the best.  I don't know about the spit in the ass.  All right.  Why?  You can't really do that yourself, can you?  Because I don't want...  You'd feel like a silly goose. 
[02:45:00]  I'd be like an idiot.  I don't want a prostitute spitting in my ass having, like, cigarettes spit in my asshole.  Nicotine.  Yeah, when shit comes out.  That's right.  It's hygienic.  Shut up.  You don't mind a cock with once in a while.  God, there's a bit of girl's saliva that's in there.  Or how about a finger?  He doesn't mind a finger if it's got a fucking World Series ring on it.  Wait a minute.  Stop for a second.  I don't like any...  I like a little lick and a little, like, tickle.  I like to call it a lickle.  Leave the ass alone.  I like almost like a baby pinky.  That's about it.  All right.  Why not a baby pinky? 
[02:45:30]  I just picture the whole scene kind of looking like she's trying to start a Model T.  You know, just cranking and...  If she yanks my cock good enough, I go out and I cut the grass immediately with my teeth.  I'm a mulcher.  All right, listen.  We have Frank the Frowner in the elevator.  I swear I had no idea they were taping.  So, Ann, you were in the elevator.  You want to set this up?  Of course.  We have to take the elevator every day with Jimmy, and it's a nightmare.  It's always a nightmare. 
[02:46:00]  You take that?  Good move, man.  I had no idea.  Sam, we're going to hire you soon.  All right, Mike.  We're going to hire you soon.  You just got to hang in there.  It'd be great.  $5 an hour good?  $6 an hour?  It's better than...  It's more than an hour, right?  It's going to be for the backwards jerk-off.  Tell Travis to go home.  We got Sam now.  Oh, wow.  Look at Travis.  That was great.  Travis is a good girl.  He really is.  All right.  We need a girl on staff.  So, what happened?  Because I got the audio.  Well, uh...  Yeah, we get in the elevator, and Jimmy, of course, stands there. 
[02:46:30]  Well, Jimmy didn't make the elevator, actually.  He missed that elevator.  Frank the Frowner was in that elevator.  And he just stands there and very loudly asks people to press the floor button.  And then he comes out with comments during the ride that are just embarrassing.  I'm only doing it to make my friends laugh.  I had no idea you were taping.  That's good.  I wasn't self-conscious.  And the elevator is packed.  There's got to be 15 people easily in this thing.  They just cram them in, because it's...  You know, girls, guys, everyone.  Nine o'clock, basically. 
[02:47:00]  All right.  And just a few of us, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Here's the audio.  Excuse me.  Ah, the door's opening.  Excuse me.  Okay.  We only let the lady off, stupid.  Do you want to take some more muscles to frown than it does to smile?  I was once informed by a man who was using my mouth as a pocket pussy.  Some horrified woman just turned to somebody she knew on the elevator in disgust. 
[02:47:30]  In total disgust.  And he's so loud doing it.  Like, are you ever loud in the elevator when you're talking to somebody?  I don't even like talking in the elevator about anything.  You know?  It's just like, I don't like talking in the elevator.  Door opens, you're out, you're done with those people. 
[02:48:00]  He almost blew out the mic on the camera, and the camera was all the way down by my waist,  so nobody knew I was recording.  I didn't know you were recording.  Never!  Like, he's just fucking loud.  Embarrassing.  We're coming up with the outfit for the O&A traveling virus for Frank the Frown.  Whenever Ope doesn't treat me respectfully, we're in an airport.  And Ope has learned to be fucking nice to Jim Norton at an airport.  Oh, yeah.  Otherwise, the iPod goes on, and talks too loud for his headphones guy, shows up.  And fucking Ope hates when talks too loud for his headphones guy, shows up. 
[02:48:30]  Well, you can't hear it, but the music's loud.  It is so uncomfortable.  I love doing that.  Like, I'll just put him on when Ope doesn't want to talk to you.  I'll just start going like, uh...  Hey, dude, what time do you think the flight's taking off?  It's really normal stuff.  And everyone looks.  But it's so loud, and everyone gets so annoyed.  I love doing that at the Starbucks, too.  As soon as I get off, I'll go, can I have a small vanilla latte, please?  And give no indication that you're fucking around.  All right, we're going to take a break. 
[02:49:00]  That's embarrassing.  How much...  Can I just ask how much the escort was?  Not an escort.  She wouldn't blow me.  She wouldn't fuck me.  It was like 150 for the hour or something.  She ever...  Actually, she was a really good massage.  What?  Not an escort.  Dude, hey.  She wasn't an escort.  She wouldn't blow me or fuck me.  But she rear would jerk me off.  Yes.  Spit in your ass.  Spit in my asshole.  What do they call them, then?  Good eggs.  Of course.  She spit in a bullseye like she was playing dark.  You know the difference, though.  You were in that world at one point in your life.  You know the difference. 
[02:49:30]  Escorts, you can communicate with and do this.  She wasn't going to do any more.  That was it.  She couldn't be bargained with to do more.  Why did she do that?  She's like the Terminator.  How did she do that?  You can't bargain with her.  Yes.  She's on a mission.  She just jerks on the back.  That's all she does.  It was $150 for a back rub.  And then she said, okay, get up on your knees.  Yeah, she was into the massage, dude.  It was like an hour and a half rub.  Well, it might have been a little...  $140.  $140.  Oh, say goodbye to everybody.  Oh, you're waving. 
[02:50:00]  I think you were waving.  That's all.  Kenny's leaving.  You're going to Disney.  Yes.  Have fun.  Be careful.  Have a safe trip.  He's a nervous trip.  He's a nervous wreck because someone died at Disney yesterday.  Plus, I'm flying JetBlue for the first time I'm using.  They're actually great.  It needed the money.  Oh.  Oh.  JetBlue.  JetBlue is a fine airline.  That's great, dude.  Great airline.  They're the only ones with newer planes in Continental as far as the fleet are concerned.  The only ones that let you watch your crashes, too.  34 channels. 
[02:50:30]  Check out the cockpit on your way in.  All flat screens.  Okay.  Cool.  All flat panels.  It's called a glass flight deck, though.  So one computer glitch and you're dead.  Right.  It's a what?  It's a glass...  It's a flat cockpit, they call it.  No real old dials and gauges.  There's no dials and things that they have to pull back on.  It's all flat screen monitors that show like an image of the altimeter and an image of  your artificial horizon.  How the fuck do you know altimeter?  He knows everything.  It's something that tells what the altitude is. 
[02:51:00]  What the fuck is this in my eggs?  It wasn't cooked all the way through.  Dude, is a piece of red something in my egg?  Oh, it's just a fucking period.  A little period blood from the savage that made the fucking egg.  It's just a little calcium deposit that fell off his chin.  Jimmy, you ate it.  Don't eat that part.  Where's the red?  It could be chicken blood.  They call those Arab nuggets.  All right.  Well, have a good weekend and a good vacation, everybody.  All right.  I wish you all well. 
[02:51:30]  Thank you for my...  Don't be nervous, Kenny.  It's the happiest place on earth.  Besides the Opie and Anthony of Studio.  Oh.  The Opie and Anthony of Studio.  What the fuck is this?  Get the fuck out of here.  Oh, no.  It fell off the egg.  What is it?  What is it?  It's red.  Well, it's just crab meat.  Crab meat.  Yeah, they have crab meat omelets.  That's what you ordered, right?  It's a piece of pepper.  Red pepper.  No.  No.  No.  You know what that is?  When you get your fingernails cut and you pull a little much of that skin off and you rip 
[02:52:00]  it off, you rip it off.  Why does my life just suck?  What?  He just...  He probably was doing his fingernails.  He got a little rushed.  He ate the whole thing before he found that, too.  He got a cuticle from an Arab.  How many did you swallow?  Hopefully, you'll take another dump on the air because that was one of the funniest things  I've ever heard.  You enjoyed it?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was the worst thing ever.  Well, today, we're going to see if Bob Kelly pukes when he sees Pat Furmanaki's ass.  I think you're a liar.  Close up.  I personally think you're a liar.  The lady from Barry Katz's office asked me how the O&A show went. 
[02:52:30]  And I was like, it's great.  She goes, did they plug the show?  I go, yeah.  Well, Jim Norton was taking a shit.  They actually...  As shit came out of his ass, I got to say...  Where you were going to be?  Where I was going to be.  Which is where?  Between me throwing up Caroline's this weekend.  Yeah.  Friday, Saturday, two shows, and Sunday.  Go check out Bobby, man.  All right.  It's really a funny show.  Before the break, Marty in Oregon.  You guys are disgusting this morning.  Marty.  Marty.  Damn it.  You're ruining my wake up.  Why?  Marty, it's so bad.  You didn't like the hooker conversation? 
[02:53:00]  I want to hear a good, clean radio from you shit dicks, damn it.  Marty, that was...  Not this disgusting display of vulgarity.  Marty, we're in silly mode, though.  Marty raises a good point.  All the faithful listeners, though, we go into silly mode the day before we take a little break.  Right, Marty.  That's right.  I was grabbing all these balls before, and he was going...  We get silly.  All right, Marty.  Jimmy, you're a heart individual.  Thank you, buddy.  Let's take a break.  O&A virus, yes, that's what we call it. 
[02:53:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show Award for Most Disturbing Phone Call goes to...  Donkey Sausage.  What's up?  Do me one favor.  What cuddles?  Why don't you get some whore into your studio and have her shit on the plate and put it  in the microwave, and then have her roll around in there screaming, donkey sausage, donkey  sausage.  Raquel?  That would be me.  You want to shit on a plate for us?  Okay.  And then run around saying what?  Donkey sausage?  Donkey sausage.  Do Jimmy Dean's donkey sausage. 
[02:54:00]  I can do that.  I can do that.  Donkey sausage!  Donkey sausage!  Donkey sausage!  I like it.  There's something oddly attractive about that.  That's got to be a promo.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Aw, nice.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The things that I lost, things that I lost, things I have sacred, that I've dropped.  I won't lie, I won't lie, I won't lie, you can't lie, I'll try out on me. 
[02:54:30]  What happened?  Come on, man.  What happened?  Look at this guy, I had a Pumpernickel bagel, and then he threw it off the floor.  Wait, what happened?  Yes.  Stupid Pumpernickel bagel with some all nice cream cheese-y substance on it, and I just flicked  it with my fingers and it went right on the floor, cream cheese down.  And here's the rest of your bagel, stupid.  Oh, there goes the other hand.  Bob, it's not part of the Fat Smash diet anyway, so. 
[02:55:00]  You put this food on the floor.  Phase four, you can have weed.  What a sick.  Right?  You're saying?  Don't fucking sit down.  Will you sit down?  He's a fat guy.  Oh, God damn, is that funny.  I wanted a Pumpernickel bagel.  I took one bite.  It was so good.  Where'd you get the I Have Gas shirt?  Oh, Walmart.  Yeah.  Well, nobody, why'd you have to bring that up?  It's radio, Ope.  Nobody knows where it is.  Yeah, we never make visual remarks on this show ever. 
[02:55:30]  I just jerked fucking Jimmy out from behind.  You're right.  And no one saw it.  I apologize.  The pal talk camera froze.  Yes, Jimmy.  One of the biggest laughs I've had in a long time was when Bobby is at the cellar, get ready  to go on stage, and he's just standing there with a bottle of water, and I just swatted  it out of his hand, and me and Quasi, who's the door guy, I've never seen...  He doesn't laugh.  I've never seen Quasi laugh like that.  It was such a guy just laughing at the misery of another guy laugh. 
[02:56:00]  That was what made me laugh harder than anything, is Quasi was just so happy that Bob had to  go up without water.  It's the little victories in our lives.  Right.  God, are you a prick?  No, he is a prick.  He always gets you till he gets you.  Because you don't see me coming.  I'm a small kid, you know?  And you never think of doing the same things that he does to you, to him.  No, because you have to fully commit.  Because it's so mean, yeah.  You have to fully commit to do something that just means and knock a dude's bagel over.  By the way, there's a lot of new stuff on opiananthony.com. 
[02:56:30]  The Dudesons are on there with their rubber band trick, that video.  Dudesons.  Def Leppard when they were in the studio.  Tons of new O&A picks.  Picks from No Filter Paul's and Big A's birthday party.  The Maury Povich pickle phobia video clip.  The corn ticket giveaway video of the mob scene.  Pat from Menaki qualifying for the Nathan's Hot Dog Contest.  That was a video from No Filter Paul.  Wow, motorcycle run picks.  It just goes on and on and on. 
[02:57:00]  Rick Voss doing his comedy at Rue 57.  It's all up there for your viewing pleasure.  OpianAnthony.com.  Dump sheet.  Dump sheet.  We had a couple today.  Yep.  Live from the Opian Anthony Show Studios, the Daily Dump Report.  Here it is.  We had two.  6.04 a.m.  Hello.  How's it going?  Suck Howard Stern's Big Fat Cock. 
[02:57:30]  That was a phone caller.  And at 8.16 a.m., when you're watching television, you can get your vagina waxed.  Bob Kelly, during a discussion of waxing and trimming hairs on your body.  Can you believe that?  When you're watching television, you can get your vagina waxed.  You can mention vagina.  You can say vagina.  You just can't ever talk about what you're doing with it. 
[02:58:00]  You know what sucks about that?  Or anything else.  That was your only funny line today, too.  I hope he just had a fucking mood swing.  Jesus Christ.  I hope he was fucking unbelievably awesome before the fucking show.  Then all of a sudden, he just turns on you.  He's seeing his eyes.  I just want to keep you honest.  He really does.  His eyes roll back like a straight white shark.  Burns on you.  Wow.  Actually, you killed this week.  I can't fake it.  You did really well for us.  No, I'm looking at the clock.  I got 20 minutes tops.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You're leaving.  Whoever else wants to stay, by all means, stay.  Dude, I don't shortchange the fans ever.  I love the fans.  All right, then you stay here, frankly.  Oh, no, not today.  I mean.  John in Nashville, what's up?  What's going on, boys?  And Elo said we could go home early.  I'm going to see a girl who I happen to be very fond of.  Oh.  Well, see now, Jimmy, when you come to Nashville, I want to take you to see a couple girls.  There's a strip club downtown, and they dance on PVC pipe.  Oh, nice.  Hey, where's Pat from Benaki? 
[02:59:00]  Sounds like a real trash place.  Did you call him again?  Yeah, that's Tennessee style right there.  So it's a good joint?  No, actually, it's not.  I just want to take Jimmy there because it's horrible.  I'll go there, man.  I like to go to places where the girls is crazy.  I one time went to this one place where the girl is shaking her bottom.  That sounds crazy.  It was crazy.  She was shaking her bottom.  Anyway, man, if you come down, you know, it probably will never happen. 
[02:59:30]  But anyway, I thought I'd extend the arm.  Shut up.  All right.  Dude.  Thank you.  Fucking ant.  Yeah.  The thing is.  Jesus.  Come on, man.  There's no more pumpernickel.  That was the last piece of pumpernickel.  Was it?  Who eats pumpernickel anyway?  Exactly.  Pumpernickel's like the last choice always.  I love how Jimmy asked me.  To participate in that.  He goes, Ant, I look over.  He, uh, well, uh, uh, Bob had taken another pumpernickel bagel with cream cheese and put 
[03:00:00]  it in a plate and tried to camouflage it with a newspaper.  And Jimmy goes, Ant, I look over and he took his fist and slammed it on top of the newspaper  where the pumpernickel paper was.  No, I put the paper on top of it just to get the dirty ink on it.  Bob looked the other way and I just, I flipped the paper to get the dirty ink on it and he  was like annoyed and then I called you to watch me just finish the job.  Now can he still eat that?  No.  Will you eat that?  Yeah, go ahead.  Pick up the fucking funnies on it.  Yeah, it's like Silly Putty. 
[03:00:30]  You're going to stretch Dondi's face.  Dondi.  Hey, let's go to Frank in the Bronx.  Frank.  Hey, boo-boo boys.  Hey there, Frank.  Frank.  I just want to let you know that little Jimmy's appearance on The Tonight Show is being replayed  Monday night.  Oh, thanks, man.  Cool.  Thank you.  Just so you guys know, punch it out.  Let's say hi to your grandfather.  I hope it gets better.  Tom in California.  Hey.  That was fucking very funny.  Thank you.  What's up, Tom?  Hey, I just want to let you know, man. 
[03:01:00]  You're out, Tom.  You don't get enough credit on this show, man.  You're hilarious.  Thank you, dude.  No, talk about me.  Again, Rob.  What?  I just got one question for you.  What was it like finally coming out and telling your parents that you were a rollerblader?  Not bad.  That was pretty good, dude.  That is kind of funny.  That was really good.  That was nice of you to say that, Rob.  I appreciate it.  But I thought it was a real compliment.  I was getting happy.  I appreciate it.  Now I'm not feeling too good about myself again.  Why?  The rollerblade line was funny.  He just went to compliment me and juggle you. 
[03:01:30]  No, but he set me up.  He doesn't think I had a good week of radio.  That's how he tricked me to go to his phone call.  No.  And then he slammed me.  I'm feeling very sad right now.  Someday people will think I'm funny.  I know it.  I know it'll happen.  We think you're funny.  I think you're funny.  Get out before I throw you out.  Hi, I'm Mrs. Webber.  It would be a health farm.  Let's go to Tim in Washington.  Tim?  Yeah, I was wondering if you guys were cutting out early today if I can get E-Rod's hero list. 
[03:02:00]  Because Opie is the greatest.  Opie's number two.  All right.  Thank you.  Are these the latest pictures going up?  They're coming up.  What are these?  Oh.  Oh, you get pictures of the cougar from the walkover.  Oh, the first picture of Frank DeFrauner up on opianathony.com.  Ooh.  So far, only one person has viewed it.  So that must have just went up.  They're on Wackbag, too, I think.  And Wackbag.com and foundyourmusic.com.  We got pictures of the cougar's ass from West Virginia. 
[03:02:30]  And she's a huge fan of the show.  Man, we shouldn't do this tour.  Frank DeFrauner.  Oh, you want to see that?  There's Frank DeFrauner.  That's a side view of Frank DeFrauner.  Oh, God.  That is the best.  What an asshole.  That is the best.  Yeah.  Let's go to Jeremy in New Jersey.  Jeremy.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Did Anthony reference Dondi?  My dad mentions that, and he's 62.  Anthony is old and finished.  We made a Dondi reference the other day when Jimmy was doing the comics, and I brought that 
[03:03:00]  back.  I don't remember reading Dondi.  Have a good weekend, boys.  Thank you, fucko.  All right.  And I mean it.  Fucko.  Let's go to Jeff the Trucker.  Jeff, what are you hauling?  Hey, well, I'm hauling nothing right now.  Yeah, absolutely nothing.  Okay.  Yeah.  Hey.  You must be hauling the content of this phone call. 
[03:03:30]  Jesus Christ.  I'm just hauling my haul.  Goggily go-go.  The Heaven 17.  Yeah.  Hey, Frank DeFrauner, are you there?  No, he's not.  Frank is here.  But he's quiet.  Frank, hey, hey, I hear that it takes more muscles to frown than it is to smile.  Why don't you try some Botox and relax those muscles, boy.  Punching out.  No, you're not punching out.  You are pressed and you are dead.  It also takes more muscles to frown than it does to shoot yourself after a line like 
[03:04:00]  that.  Oh, here it is, guys.  Here it is.  Gary in Tennessee.  Hey, OB.  Yeah.  I wanted to tell you that Jim Norton is the best.  Oh.  Oh.  I tricked you.  Thanks.  Put it out, guys.  But it said OB's the best.  I read that.  He tricked me again.  He tricked you into taking his call just to compliment Midgeme.  Wow.  Who saw that coming?  I'm Jim backwards.  Do you know who Midgeme was?  I'm Jim. 
[03:04:30]  Backwards, yeah.  Backwards.  Let's go to Jason from California.  Jason.  That was ridiculous.  McMillan.  OB, you're the man.  Thanks, dude.  OB, you're the man.  Appreciate it.  Can you hear me, though?  Yeah, I got you.  Thanks, man.  Hey, OB.  The reason I'm calling the other day, the fans were giving me crap because you had such  a bad day.  And I got to tell you, dude, the only superheroes I can relate you guys to are Fantastic Four. 
[03:05:00]  You're the freaking guy that keeps it all together.  You're the showgoer.  You're like Mr. Stretch.  Great.  Great.  I get the boring job.  That's what I want to hear.  I got the boring job.  You're Mr. Stretch.  No, you've got the multiple.  It's nice to know I got the job that anyone else could have.  Thank you.  I really appreciate the compliment.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Well, then you've got Anthony, who's the pretty little invisibility guy that disappears after  the show and vanishes into thin air.  Well, that's true.  Then you've got Sweet Jimmy, who's like the little fireball that gets all the chicks. 
[03:05:30]  And then, I don't know who the thing would be, but Bob Kelly sure had the face of the thing.  This could be the worst analogy ever for anything I've ever heard.  I think we're going to get a better four.  Ever, ever.  We're three people.  And you know what, sir?  You're like the thing.  Because when I see you laying there on the phone, I'm like, is this a glop of shit?  I don't know, but it's a thing.  It's some thing.  That's right.  Don't ever call the fucking show again, Ben Grimm.  Where's Pat from Menaki?  Hopefully in a fucking accident.  Hopefully right now he's on the hood with his foot still on the fucking vehicle. 
[03:06:00]  He's going to try to win the hot dog eating contest through both ends.  Through a strange twist in the rules through a loophole.  He's going to eat him and shove him up his ass at the same time.  That vagina ass of his.  I hope the EMS saw him fucking like with his pants down in a bloody mess.  And they thought he was an elephant and tried to walk him through the fucking Brooklyn Battery Tunnel backwards.  Backwards.  Where is he?  We need the show stuff.  He was supposed to show up, but I think he... 
[03:06:30]  Don't throw the whole pan out.  Wow.  Wow, that was disrespectful.  Well, then.  All right, then.  Getting a little rambunctious there, throwing things at Opie.  As soon as he threw it, he knew he fucked up.  He tried to smile it off.  Yeah.  Eat your bagel.  Eat your bagel.  I don't have a fucking bagel.  Eat your fucking bagel.  You're going to take that?  Are you going to shoot him in the foot?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  Angry baby?  We're going to take that.  Angry baby.  Angry baby. 
[03:07:00]  Back a ways.  That's very good.  Let's go to Paul and New Rochelle.  Opie, I love you and Lucky Louie.  I think you're the greatest.  I think you're phenomenal.  I really...  You know, you're an Academy Award winner, Best Supporting Actor in the Drama, you know.  Well, I am an actor.  Enjoy your weekend.  Anthony, don't throw nigger chases.  Be nice.  See you.  Jesus.  Why does it have to turn racist?  This, um...  What is a nigger chaser?  It's a firework.  Oh, I was going to say police officer.  Look how they just rolled off your tongue.  That's what they called him in the old days. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, you take the stick off.  Actually, you take the...  See?  You know what it is.  You take the stick off a bottle rocket.  And then, you know...  Fourth of July.  Give it a new fun name.  Jason, how long are you?  I don't know what the hell you want from me.  Fourth of July is bullshit.  I don't think it is anything.  Jason.  Yeah.  Opie, I just want to say, I think you're the soul of the show.  Anthony's the funny guy with the voices.  Jimmy's the comedian.  The very multi-talented man.  But, Opie, if it wasn't for you, there would be no O and A.  You are the soul, my friend.  Well, there wouldn't be an O.  There would just be an A and it would be A. 
[03:08:00]  There would just be an A with J.  Great.  An A-J.  Great.  I'll call him the bass player, would you?  A and J.  Yeah, really?  He's keeping tempo.  I love being the tambourine player.  Thanks.  That's it, you are.  I have an egg shaker.  I'm the guy that gets to play cowbell.  Thanks.  I really appreciate the compliments.  Hey.  I did love you on Lucky Louie, though.  Thank you.  All right.  Oh, no.  You'll enjoy this week's.  This guy wants to do an Opie impression.  Tom in North Carolina.  Hey, how you doing? 
[03:08:30]  Hey.  I want to do a Opie impression.  I hope you're there.  Wow, that's my bit, man.  You can't use it.  Wow, that's my bit, man.  You can't use it.  Wow.  You know, sir, I'm going to step out of character.  This is Jim Norton, the actor who plays Fight the Father.  That's one of my most brilliant, brilliant creations.  What?  The, you know.  Fight the Father?  Stepping out of character.  The stepping out of character thing.  Because then it justifies that I'm like a normal person when I'm not here.  Well, you know what it is? 
[03:09:00]  You kind of got it from Jim and made it your own.  I did not.  Which is a good thing.  Not many people can do that.  Speaking of things not many people can do.  Hey, that's my brother's bit I told you that I stole.  I'm not going to be tricked anymore.  Cooey's confession thrown out.  This guy who raped and murdered this little girl and he buried her alive in Florida and  they threw his confession out.  The judge says his confession cannot be used in court.  Well, I believe he's free to go then.  He buried her alive. 
[03:09:30]  This fucking guy.  Buried alive.  We are a fucking finished society.  Buried alive.  Why did they throw it out?  Because.  Gone.  Sorry.  Had to do a Wrath of Khan reference.  Because the judge is probably some liberal cunt because he probably didn't have his fucking  Miranda rights read.  Or some dog shit like that.  A lot of times they throw out confessions because the lawyer's not present and then the  lawyer gets there and goes, ah, I was under duress.  He should be fucking, the victim's family should be able to just beat him to death with a 
[03:10:00]  bat.  So if you, if you actually get caught on a murder, you could actually just confess without your  lawyer right away and then they'd have to throw it.  So you could use that.  Sometimes they throw it out.  Yeah.  What's double jeopardy?  Can't be tried twice for the same crime.  Same crime.  Look at this fat fucking piece of shit.  Judge Richard Howard.  The circuit judge.  So, uh, technically OJ could confess completely to the murders.  And not have to, uh, go to jail. 
[03:10:30]  I don't know about that.  He was acquitted.  He was acquitted.  He was acquitted.  He was acquitted.  Nah, nah, nah, but.  He was acquitted.  I know that.  It's double jeopardy.  That's true.  I disagree.  I think on a confession like that.  I think you're wrong.  I thought that too.  I don't think it's double double jeopardy.  There's a lawyer out there that knows.  I don't think that falls under the double jeopardy.  I have a mic right here.  I know.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Anthony, if me and you committed a crime, we killed Jimmy.  We stabbed him in his tits.  Right?  Right?  You will be committing a crime when you accept Caroline's money. 
[03:11:00]  Wow.  I was just saying.  Son of a bitch.  I deserve it, though.  I try to sneak in the tits line.  I know.  You fucking tried.  Now you're just reading the paper.  You're trying to hurt my feelings.  And I just like it.  That guy requested a lawyer, didn't get one before his confession.  That's why the confession is now thrown out.  But what are you saying?  We kill Jimmy.  If we kill Jimmy, right, we both do, but they catch me and they think I did it.  So I go in, I confess to it, right? 
[03:11:30]  But then all of a sudden, I say I didn't do it.  Say I didn't do it.  And you say I did it.  Yeah.  Right?  Then they take you in, but then I say I did it.  And you say I didn't do it.  And we just switch it up.  They try us both.  Yeah, but they can't try me because they acquitted me because they said you did it.  You said I did it.  I did it.  Anthony did it.  Wait, they wouldn't acquit you.  Why not?  They would either not charge you or have a trial and find you guilty if you were involved. 
[03:12:00]  But no, they find me not guilty.  How'd they find you not guilty?  Because you're admitting that you did it.  But we killed them.  No, you did it.  I did not.  You say I had nothing to do with it.  Then I go to prison.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Yeah.  So we're dropping the charges against you because you didn't do it.  We found you not guilty.  Uh-huh.  Bobby Kelly.  Right.  So I go away.  But then as soon as they bring you in, I say, you know what?  He didn't do it.  I killed him.  I killed Jimmy.  Your credibility stinks. 
[03:12:30]  I go to jail for the rest of my life.  I'll get to death.  But I wonder...  I bet you...  I bet you someone you...  I bet you...  I like you...  Somebody has used that.  I think somebody's probably come up with a way around that one.  I bet somebody's used that and got aware with it.  I bet it has something to do with you wouldn't fall under double jeopardy because of perjury  or something like that.  By pleading not guilty, you perjured yourself.  I don't know what the law is, obviously, but there's no way that's good.  Twins have gotten off on murder charges where one is involved, the other one isn't.  And from the description, they don't know which one it is. 
[03:13:00]  And neither one will fess up to it.  And they're twins.  That's different, though.  Yeah.  That's different, though, because, you know...  What do you think of that?  Well, you know, a lot of times it was racial tension in the 60s.  I hope he just wants to go home.  I think your aunt's going to raise something that has nothing to do with the case.  I might as well, too.  I hope he can't wait until he has wheels under his feet.  Wheels under his feet.  Swaying up.  I'm 57th Street.  I don't sway.  Sway.  I don't sway.  You ever see your own actors?  Xanadu music on. 
[03:13:30]  Xanadu.  Don't sway.  You do.  One half of your sweatshirt billowing fucking pointlessly.  You have an open shirt with all the buttons undone.  Like a cape.  Xanadu.  Let's go to Detroit.  Joe, help me out here.  Hello?  Joe, I was counting on you.  How do you do, Joe?  Find the room comfortable.  No complaints.  How you guys doing?  Good.  I don't know. 
[03:14:00]  Anyways, I wanted to request E-Rock Radio for when you guys leave early today.  Hey, Joe, have you been sitting on the sofa munchy-wunchy lumpdicks of toast?  All right, Joe.  Maybe we'll do E-Rock Radio.  We've got E-Rock's MySpace blog in front of us right now.  Talking in movie theaters by E-Rock.  E-Rock's blog.  Current mood annoyed.  E-Rock's blog.  He has current mood.  What do you think that's going to catch on? 
[03:14:30]  Current mood?  What's E-Rock's current mood?  I've got to get to his blog.  How about current status?  Incompetent.  This is what's wrong with technology.  This right here.  Just saw us.  Oh.  He's so pissed.  Oh, he's running around.  He might not actually hurt somebody.  Yeah, he is really mad.  Where is he?  What are they doing?  Nothing more entertaining than a pissed E-Rock.  No, it's great.  When someone gets really pissed around here, instead of everyone being sympathetic, they  run and get the camera.  They run.  They run and giggle, though.  Cameras, microphones.  They giggle like munchkins.  Yeah, and where's Pat from Minaki? 
[03:15:00]  We need the big showstopper today.  Don't blow us off, Pat.  Let's read this fucking faggity blog.  All right, just saw X-Men 3.  This is E-Rock's MySpace blog.  Talking in movie theaters is the headline.  Current mood annoyed.  I'm seeing some punctuations that might mean that somebody else might have to read this.  Well, the punctuations are way down over theirs.  Oh, right.  Oh, why?  Because I don't read well?  Oh. 
[03:15:30]  Why are you going to shut up today before vacation?  I was, it was.  You could just come out and say it instead of.  I saw big capital letters with exclamation points, and I thought.  But you could just say it instead of like.  Perhaps midgemen.  Oh, that's stupid.  I know what it means when you said that.  You don't want me to read this.  Why are you shitting up?  Why would you do that, Anthony?  I'm going to read it upside down.  Sometimes I do that.  To look happy.  Say Frank DeFran.  We want that character to last.  Okay.  Don't mean to tear down the fifth wall or nothing. 
[03:16:00]  What are you saying?  That character's getting old?  I had a good one, too.  Absolutely.  Frank DeFran.  Absolutely.  I had a good one.  Somebody just wants to go home.  And you just held it.  I got about four minutes left.  We have a mic on Eric.  Eric!  In the office.  Hi, Eric.  Eric!  Jesus.  Iraq.  Iraq!  What is your current mood?  We need to know.  He's coming our way.  All right.  I looked. 
[03:16:30]  What's wrong?  That's bad when Patty's laughing at you hysterically.  What's wrong?  I didn't know the mic was sitting right next to me in the office.  I turn around.  There's Danny smiling with a mic in my face.  Oh.  Hot.  So what's the problem?  Was it between his legs, pulled backwards on all fours?  Is that hair attached to your hat?  Hey, Gallagher.  Hey, leave Vic Morrow alone.  Dude, what is going on today with that hair?  Just shave the goddamn thing.  That fucking hairdo.  What is that?  It's enragingly awful. 
[03:17:00]  It's sticking straight out.  You fucking leaf thatch head.  I've never seen that.  I don't mean it, dude.  You get a lot of abuse in this show, I understand.  But have you seen yourself in the mirror today?  That should be fucking sheltering an aborigine.  It just goes back in place.  You have to cut your hair with a bat.  Dude, you don't need to wear a baseball hat.  You already got like a hair lid happening.  Exactly. 
[03:17:30]  He's got a...  Just paint an NY on it and blow off a fan.  He's got a lid head.  You made it real easy today.  I'm sorry.  Something's going on with your hair.  I don't know what, but...  Your hair's all straight out.  Like it's a giant umpire safe sign.  Pfizer-like quality to it, but...  I think it's just because you had the hat on.  All right.  We're about to read your blog.  Is that okay?  Go ahead. 
[03:18:00]  Current mood.  Is this something that every blog, you put current mood, annoyed, or current mood.  Have you ever been happy?  Are there ones that you only use?  Or it's whatever it is.  Is there like a list?  Happy, annoyed, pissed off?  Like one through five.  Yeah, there's a whole list of that stuff.  What is it when you're in a good mood?  I don't know.  I think there's a bunch of variations.  No, you do know.  So I guess happy, good.  You do know.  You do know.  What is it?  Happy?  Happy, good, glad, current mood.  There's another one in there that would make us all go, ew. 
[03:18:30]  Ecstatic, fabulous.  Give us the list, Hawk.  We know you have it.  It's in your little...  It's under that fucking abominable hairdo.  Lift that fucking attic door hairdo and fucking let us peer into your mind.  You should be the only man alive that prays that he loses his hair.  That fucking hair.  When they cut it, it's in a creek.  It's the only one.  That's funny.  That's funny, Obi. 
[03:19:00]  With that fucking hair, dude, you should be throwing a bomb in a helicopter.  That was good, though.  Thanks.  Think, bitch, I ran a ramp her ass.  I'll be happy with that one when I'm driving in Nantucket.  Well, of course, you can't drive there.  You got to drive and take the ferry.  Vietnamese guy.  I think people understood what I was saying when I said that.  Uh, what?  Adam, me?  I didn't say anything.  Give us some of the moods.  Dude, don't get mad at me today.  It's too easy today.  Yeah, give us some...  If I'm able to goof on you, you know it's easy.  Do we have a list of some of his old blogs?  What are the moods?  Okay, well, these are all the possible... 
[03:19:30]  Oh, possible moods?  Yeah.  All right, let's hear.  It's a pretty long list, so just say when.  Accomplished, aggravated, amused, angry, annoyed, anxious, apathetic, artistic...  Hold on.  Accomplished?  Yeah, what would...  How is that a mood?  That's the list from the server.  That's not mine.  But you used it, though.  Oh, you have to click.  No, these are options.  These are all MySpace options, so it's not EROC options.  We were looking for the EROC options.  Yeah, I want an EROC option.  Current mood, annoyed.  The fact that you didn't even use that just bugs me. 
[03:20:00]  Let's go, because I'm in overtime right now.  This is a talking in movie theater, so that would be annoyed.  Okay.  Opie, you want to read this?  I obviously can't read.  Next time, you might as well just tell me.  Jesus Christ!  Opie, I can read the signs.  The one thing I am is smart.  Look, there's three paragraphs here.  And I'm really good at reading people.  Here it is.  I can't read things, but I'm good at reading people.  There's like three solid segments to this. 
[03:20:30]  You read the first one.  Let Midge me read the second one.  Let Bob read the first one.  How about Bob reads the whole thing?  No, let Bob read the first one.  I'm not reading that.  All right.  All right, ready?  Let's do this.  Let's do this, Opie.  Because I'm dumber than anybody in this room.  All right.  You're not going to get an argument from anyone.  Read away.  Jeez, I'm sticking up for you.  I know.  I just saw X-Men 3.  Wasn't a big fan of the movie.  Not as good as the others.  But this shit, posting isn't about that. 
[03:21:00]  On the show, there was an old bit where Anthony went to see Mission Impossible Deuce.  And people wouldn't shut up in the movie theater.  I happened to be in the same area.  Oh, my God.  What the fuck is that?  Get a mic on him.  Get a mic on him.  Get a mic on him.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Pat from Munaki. 
[03:21:30]  Had his asshole open while Bob was reading.  JP.  JP.  Totally distracted him.  That's why I said Bob reads.  I heard Pat was here.  So, Bob's reading.  Pat from Munaki comes up right next to him.  Pulls his pants down and spreads his ass cheeks.  And then, Big Kev, good call for coming in and whispering.  Very nice.  And then, who said, like, Bobby, look. 
[03:22:00]  I did.  I did.  Yeah, he goes, Bob, look.  Listen, listen.  Bob turned his head.  Oh, God.  He turned his head and was point blank right into a pet.  Wait, dude, please.  Pet asshole.  Oh, you creep with the microphone.  Dude, I really want you to take Bob's phone. 
[03:22:30]  Oh, God.  And not do anything off with it, but just put it against the back of your balls and take  a picture of it and show it to him while he's on the phone.  Oh, God.  Someone call him.  Yes.  Hurry, hurry, hurry.  Quick.  Hurry, hurry.  Quick.  Make sure it doesn't demand.  Hurry, hurry, hurry.  Quick.  Turn around, stupid.  Put it on your...  We'll erase the picture if you don't want it published.  Quick.  No, get the microphone against your...  Put it right on it.  Put it on your ball.  Touch it.  Touch it.  Yeah.  Yeah, mouth part.  No, the mouth part on your hands. 
[03:23:00]  Oh, God.  Put it against it.  Put it against it.  All right, God.  Okay.  All right.  Now put it back.  Now put it back where it was.  Put your pants on my fucking homo.  Put it exactly where it was.  Danny, put it in the sleeve or I'll stab you.  Oh, my God.  All right, Bob.  And then somebody call him during the show here.  What's his number?  All right, hold on.  Bob.  He's coming back.  Holy shit.  That is so fucking wrong.  What?  This works out.  What, dude? 
[03:23:30]  Just come back in.  Everything's all right.  That's horrible.  Let me see.  Oh, God, dude.  Let me see.  You're fucking gross.  That's the grossest thing I've ever seen in my life.  Oh, God damn.  This asshole is brown.  Yeah.  Brown and yellow.  You should have got the phone.  You all right?  You should have got the phone against it.  We do.  It was yellow and brown and purple.  Yeah.  Do it.  Believe me.  All right.  Oh, God.  You all right?  All right.  Bob Kelly's playing Carolines all weekend long. 
[03:24:00]  We highly recommend you go see Bob.  Holy shit.  It's an O&A pest alert.  Definitely support Bob Kelly this weekend at Carolines here in New York City.  How are we going to get him to answer the phone?  212-757-4100.  My shot.  My shot.  Let's do it.  All right, listen.  We're doing a bit.  Oh, by the way, save this for when we get back.  Tell him to test his cell phone and call you or something like that.  Tell him to do it.  Like we're doing something else.  We always have competitions about phones.  Yeah, I know.  Maybe.  I could say.  Oh, yeah.  No.  Wait.  Someone just calls his number from outside the studio. 
[03:24:30]  Not even my answer.  Let's make it like we're talking about our phones.  Who cares about how good they are?  Because mine, it's small.  Bobby.  Bobby, Bob Kelly, everyone.  He's compact.  He's got his pants on.  And I don't care what he's...  He's got his pants on.  Dude, you're assholes.  No, that is disgusting.  Abominable.  And I don't care...  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  Okay.  Come in.  I'm not a fan.  I don't hate my phone.  No, listen.  Listen, speaking of phones.  No fucking way.  Bob.  Go ahead.  Tell these guys what was happening. 
[03:25:00]  What's going on?  What's going on?  No, man.  Shut up.  I don't fucking trust you guys.  Actually, I'll tell you.  What's happening?  I'll tell you.  You all got phones in your hands.  No, tell the guys what happens with your phone.  It hangs up on itself because of your fat cheeks.  Did he put the phone in his ass?  No.  No.  Oh.  Is that a ring?  Why didn't we think of it?  No, actually.  My what?  This is actually a legitimate question.  While you were puking and cleaning up...  We thought it was funny because you were talking about it.  When you answer phone calls, you hang up on yourself because you're a fat cheek.  Mine absolutely will not... 
[03:25:30]  Can I tell you guys something?  You don't go from fucking zero to 60.  Hold on.  You were puking.  We were trying to talk to you.  You didn't have fucking headphones.  So, the bit was kind of done.  I can't get an asshole out of my head.  So, we got into the fact that he told about when you hung up with your fat cheek and I  said that's why I have fucking flip phones.  I set this thing wrong.  This is absolutely...  That's you.  I set this wrong.  It will say that it's calling, but I won't hear anything.  Because I have a setting.  Listen.  And I'll only have a flip phone.  It's connected.  Look. 
[03:26:00]  Because...  Answer and talk to me, but do not...  Asshole.  Tell me if you can hear me.  ...speak dial and fucking call you from their car and they don't even know that they're  fucking talking to you.  He's checking out the phone.  It's fine.  Just do it, you idiot.  It's not ringing.  Huh?  I'm not an idiot.  I'm a human being.  Pick it up and...  No, but you're checking out the phone like we did something to it.  We didn't do anything to your phone.  Look, it's not ringing.  I'm looking at the fucking phone.  Why is this not...  It says...  Oh, wait.  Last call.  Hold on.  You probably hop on it.  I don't have your number.  No, no.  Mine says connected.  Huh?  I need your number.  Three, four, seven.  I didn't have it.  Don't give out his fucking number on me. 
[03:26:30]  I know.  You got it?  See, now it says connected.  Seven, eight.  Your phone stinks.  That's why.  No, it's just...  I have a setting wrong.  What's going on?  Try it.  Try it.  You can call you?  Try it.  Try what?  Call me.  I guarantee you.  I want to see if it will ring.  We never exchange numbers.  Like, I don't...  You don't like Bob.  I just got like...  Bob, I now like you.  Like, fan's number is pretty much the only person I have that I really shouldn't have.  Is it ringing?  Yeah, but watch. 
[03:27:00]  Now, it's ringing.  Yeah.  Hello?  Nope.  Yeah, hello.  Do you hear anything from me?  No.  No.  I'm connected.  It does ring.  But now watch.  This is why I have this fucking headphone.  They'll bust my balls with this to the headphones.  Oh, this is goddamn fucking air traffic controller.  Yeah, I know, but look at this.  Now it's plugged in.  The headphone's plugged in.  I hear you great.  See?  Now that I told you...  This is through my headphone here.  I can hear you fantastic, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I can hear you.  So I can somehow...  Or that one. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah.  I can hear you.  The fuck is that, dude?  That's...  I mean, it's fucking...  It's like...  What's wrong, Bob?  Breeze deep together.  Fucking vagina?  What's wrong, Bob?  No, no, it's not...  I don't think you got a good enough look at it.  Wait, Bob, you didn't get...  There's something a little different about that picture.  Bob, you might want to look at that...  Mike...  Bob, you might want to look at that picture a little closely. 
[03:28:00]  I don't want to look at that...  No, just...  Did you put the fucking phone...  Zoom up...  Well, just take a little look at it.  Just take a look.  Oh!  You put my phone in your ass, you fucking savage.  No.  No.  You can get him to the back of the ball.  Just the back of the ball.  Dude, what's my fucking phone?  That's over the line.  That's over the line.  A fucking bagel on the ground is one thing.  Show me...  You put my fucking 700-dollar trio in his asshole.  Who fucking does that?  That's over the line.  They made me.  You didn't fucking have to stick in your ass, you circus freak. 
[03:28:30]  You fucking cocksucker.  Now you owe me 700.  I'm not fucking with that phone anymore.  You stuck it in your fucking fat pussy.  I'll pay for a new one with my winnings, too.  Did he stick it in his ass?  I didn't even look at the phone.  No.  Look at the photo.  Yeah, I do.  Look at the photo.  You might be happy.  Don't worry so much.  Yeah, we'll just look around.  The mic went out, Jimmy.  Look at the picture.  He's looking at the picture now. 
[03:29:00]  Oh, he's puking.  You all right, Bob?  Oh, God.  Bob, you all right?  What's wrong with his asshole?  Has a phone in it.  I'm with you on that.  I really don't know, but there is something wrong with his ass.  Did you see the phone in the picture?  Did you crack it go off?  It really is red and open.  What do you think Nathan's hot dogs went through that asshole?  Dude, it looks like an open wound.  Yeah.  See your phone?  E-Rock, you're off the hook.  Your face is right up the ground. 
[03:29:30]  We'll read the blog when we get back.  Oh, fuck.  I've got to wash my phone now because his fucking cunt was in it.  That's fine.  What part was it?  The mouth part, stupid.  The part you put up to your face.  The ear part.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  He's puking.  How can anybody not like that? 
[03:30:00]  Bob, by the way, I'm sorry I called you a liar.  I'm sorry.  Bob, look at me for a second.  Bob.  Bob, turn around, please.  Jimmy's ass is right in his face.  Poor Bob has such a...  He has such a very, um...  He has a sour stomach. 
[03:30:30]  Sour stomach.  No, he doesn't have any, uh, uh...  What is that called?  Stomach biolistic.  Like, some people can take that shit.  That is classic.  Others, like...  He's got no constitution for that kind of thing.  All right.  The phone...  When he saw the picture of the phone touching the back of your ball sack.  Yes.  Echo holes. 
[03:31:00]  Oh, is that fucking funny?  He pukes on Torgasm a bunch, too, man.  That's the real deal.  Bob, where are you going to be this weekend?  Bob!  Goddamn fucking...  Bob!  Can you hear us in there?  No.  Oh.  Yeah, I got you.  Bob!  Yeah.  Where are you going to be this weekend?  I'm going to be at fucking Caroline's.  How'd the phone smell?  Bob, get your plug in, because we're going off the air.  In between puking, please.  We're going to be at Caroline's. 
[03:31:30]  Friday.  Two shows.  Saturday, two shows.  Sunday, one show.  Caroline's.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Fuck.  Caroline's at Broadway.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, his fucking ass was in my phone.  Bob, even though you don't sound funny right now, you are very funny, and I encourage people  to go see you at Caroline's.  Yeah, he's a very funny comic. 
[03:32:00]  You're a good sport.  You're a good sport to the Opie and Anthony show for tickets 212-757-4100.  The pest will be there in full force to support you as you become the next big, big thing  in comedy, Bob.  You're going to be the next big thing.  He's the thing on Torgasm.  You don't need to warm up for Dane Cook anymore, my friend, okay?  He's the guy to watch on Torgasm.  Bob?  What?  Bob?  You all right?  You feeling any better? 
[03:32:30]  Why would you put my fucking phone in something like that?  In something like that?  Pat's going to cry.  It's not that bad.  You should talk on that phone again.  You should get that fucking tumor removed.  I don't know what the hell was going on with that.  I don't even want to know.  Is that Jim?  What?  Jim, don't.  I don't want to see your ass, Jim.  Yeah, Jimmy told me to stall.  Jim, are you pissing on the ground?  Dude, you're pissing on the ground.  What kind of fucking freak show is this? 
[03:33:00]  Jimmy will just walk in the bathroom and start pissing on the floor.  He's a fucking animal.  Oh, God.  Just put down wood chips for him.  Like wood shavings.  He's like a fucking hamster.  How do you wash your cell phone?  You don't.  By the way, Danny the Trucker is saying this is revenge for Bob's anti-trucker promo.  He did.  Yeah, that must be it.  That's exactly it.  All right.  Are you boys done in there?  Oh, God.  Bob? 
[03:33:30]  Yeah, I'm coming.  All right.  I'll see you guys later.  I think I'm puking up blood.  No.  Yeah, blood just came out.  No way.  Yep.  E-Rock, you're a lucky boy.  You're off the hook.  Oh, fucking E-Rock.  You want to do E-Rock radio?  I just wanted to do the old fucking...  You can't do E-Rock radio?  Why?  They're requesting E-Rock radio.  He can't today.  Why can't you?  What are you going on?  Fucking dirty.  What?  Oh, damn it.  I turned to Than and I was going to give him a call and I'm looking at him and he's giving 
[03:34:00]  me that look of hope and I just go, no.  What'd Than want?  Than wants to run the show for a little bit.  E-Rock current mood?  Busy.  Right?  Yes.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Than, you want to take some requests?  Wow.  Sure.  Too bad.  How about...  A little airtime.  How about Pat from Munaki radio?  Oh.  And Than will help out.  Big asshole radio.  How's that sound?  Hey, I got nothing.  Get up to me right here.  Some phone calls and you take requests from the listeners for a half hour. 
[03:34:30]  How's that sound?  Bring it out.  All right.  What happened, Mars?  He wants the wipes.  Give me the wipes.  Why are you...  Oh, he's got a wipe.  Oh, he's going to sterilize the phone with the lightsaber.  Dude.  I can hear you, you cocksucker.  You little dirt monger.  Well, what do you think he said?  I don't...  He said something.  What's he doing?  I'm not...  What do you think, stupid?  What do you think he's doing?  I don't know.  Oh.  Oh.  Don't...  What's wrong? 
[03:35:00]  Oh, he's running.  He just kicked pat in the knee.  Don't kick him.  He's kicking pat.  He's kicking pat.  Bob is fucking leaving.  Bob is pissed.  He just threw a penis at the side of the side of the side. 
[03:35:30]  He doesn't give a cry.  All right.  We're going to do...  Pat from Menachie is going to get us to 11 o'clock.  And then at 11, we have an hour of really, really good Opie and Anthony when we're taking  this seriously.  But we're out of here.  We're out of here.  Bob Kelly, thank you.  Thank you, Bob.  Caroline's.  Yeah.  Caroline's with Bob Kelly all weekend long.  Pat, sit down in the seat.  Take requests from the listeners.  Dan will help you out.  And we're going to take a long weekend, guys.  So we'll see you sometime next week. 
[03:36:00]  We're still trying to figure all that out.  Oh, God.  All right.  All right, man.  Yeah, we'll see you.  Great job, man.  Yeah.  If you want to request some of the short bits that we play from time to time that you haven't  heard in a while, give Pat from Menachie and Thana a call right now.  Thanks for listening, guys.  Unpredictable.  Unleashed.  Unruly.  Unwashed.  Unkempt.  I stink.  Next thing I knew, I had my pants down around my knees and my shirt pulled up to my armpits. 
[03:36:30]  Shut up!  No, who cares?  I can't believe you fell for that again.  Damn you, Hawk. </pre>
