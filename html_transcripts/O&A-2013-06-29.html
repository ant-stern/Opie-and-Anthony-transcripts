<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a "Worst of the Week Countdown," featuring a disastrous "$25,000 Pyramid" game played by Lady Diane Marion, Bobo, and intern Jackie, riddled with technical issues and contestant confusion.  This was followed by a lengthy and highly offensive discussion of Paula Deen's controversial *Today* Show interview, where her use of the n-word was the central topic.  The hosts' commentary included frequent use of racial slurs.  Throughout the show, several guests were present in the studio, including Larry King, tightrope walker Nick Wallenda, and porn star Melanie Monroe. Chris Rock was also on-site filming a movie, leading to a segment mocking producer E-Rock for wearing an unexpectedly clean collared shirt – a stark contrast to his usual attire.  The hosts, along with Sal, Travis, and Sam, engaged in extended, humorous speculation about E-Rock's motivations and imagined scenarios of him appearing in Chris Rock's film.  Jackie was repeatedly praised for her napkin-fetching skills.  A clip from a previous show featuring Melanie Monroe, "Chip," and Chip's mother, containing explicit sexual humor, was played. Another clip featured Larry King.  E-Rock's shirt remained a running gag throughout the segment.


Larry King, a guest in studio, shared anecdotes about sharing an emergency room with Ronald Reagan after the assassination attempt, his own heart attack, bypass surgery (during which he learned his surgeon was missing a thumb), and his HGH use.  The conversation transitioned to the show's interactions with Rich Vaughn and Jim Norton.  Nick Wallenda then joined, discussing his Grand Canyon tightrope walk, preparation, safety concerns, family history, and future plans, including a potential walk across the Petronas Towers.  This was followed by a return of Lady Di and Marion, whose highly inappropriate, racially charged commentary on various news stories continued the show's offensive tone.


The next segment featured a chaotic discussion with Lady Di, Marion, and Jim Norton.  The conversation started with a vague mention of a Caribbean trial, then shifted to Norton's television appearances and comedy gigs.  A significant portion focused on Lady Di's personal life, particularly her relationship with her roommate, Bill, with explicit details shared about their sex life and living arrangements.  Her unemployment and reliance on Bill were also discussed.  Bob Levy called in, adding to the already boisterous exchange.  The conversation drifted to the Monkees, prompted by Lady Di's upcoming concert attendance, incorporating a story about a Monkees convention.  The focus returned to Lady Di’s personal life.  A surprise guest, Ira, joined the studio, furthering the chaotic conversation.  Discussions of attending a Gay Pride parade and further miscellaneous chatter concluded the segment.


The final segment included a caller discussing his recent engagement, leading to a humorous riff on "why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free."  John Mulaney then played a darkly comedic "Big Brother," interrogating the hosts.  An Andy Rooney impersonation followed, answering bizarre and sexually explicit questions.  Al Madrigal discussed his experiences as a Latino comedian, dealing with nosy neighbors (and passive-aggressively communicating with them via wifi network names), a racist Golden Corral commercial, and explaining adult concepts to his children, particularly regarding lyrics by R. Kelly and Kesha.  Tom Papa and another unidentified comedian performed a government-themed sketch, concluding with them leaving to get pie. The show ended with concluding thoughts on privacy and promotional announcements.

Larry King was in studio.  Tightrope walker Nick Wallenda is in studio.  But let's start the show.  We'll get to all of that.  We're going to start the show with a little bit of Lady Diane Marion, 
[00:02:00]  two former fixtures of the Opie and Anthony Show that this week finally made their in-studio return  after like five or six years.  These two have been regulars on the show before.  They disappeared for a while.  They're finally back, and boy, did they come back.  I want to start this week's Worst of the Week Countdown  with Lady Diane Marion on one team  versus everybody's favorite audience member, Bobo, 
[00:02:30]  and the lovely intern Jackie on another team.  It's $25,000 pyramid time on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Number eight.  Eight.  Eight.  Eight.  Eight.  Eight.  Number eight.  One of you will be given a second award.  One of you will be given...  You can't hear anything?  I can't hear.  All right.  Now I can hear.  I can't. 
[00:03:00]  I can't take this.  I can't hear now.  What's going on?  Now you can hear, right?  You can hear now, right?  Holy shit.  All right.  Ant's trying to describe the game to you ladies.  Here's...  Okay, we're going to try again.  Here's how the game works.  Go ahead, man.  Okay.  Can we get the music?  All right.  One of you will be given a topic or a subject or a thing  that you need to describe to the other one.  The other one, they must say what that topic or subject or thing is,  but you can't use the name of it when you're giving the... 
[00:03:30]  What's the problem?  You can give the clues, Marion.  No.  Are you going to answer?  No, we tell...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  No, they tell the clues.  All right.  You can choose.  Okay.  So she's going to be giving the clues to you.  And you're going to have to come up with an answer.  You're going to have to come up with an answer.  Right.  All right.  We have a list of clues.  Yes.  Turn around.  That we're going to be...  Yeah, you turn that way.  Don't look.  You've got to face me.  All right.  Sam will...  Give me the sheet for the clues.  All right.  That's good.  No, no.  Sam will show it to you over Lady Di's shoulder. 
[00:04:00]  Okay.  Okay.  And then...  And then...  She's got to take her headphones off so we can say what the clue is to the audience.  Right, right, right.  Wait a minute.  Do I got to take my headphones off?  No, not you.  Lady Di...  Well, maybe they should leave the studio.  No, just for a second.  No, no.  Just for a second.  No, no.  Diane, take your headphones off.  Take your headphones off.  Give me...  Oh, do you want to whisper to the audience?  Or...  Hold on.  Yeah.  Okay.  We don't want you to see the clue.  Hey, earmuffs.  Lady Di, earmuffs.  Earmuffs.  Put your fingers in your ears.  Earmuffs.  Not the headphones.  The radio comes through there.  We want to make sure you don't hear. 
[00:04:30]  We want to make sure you don't hear.  All right.  All right.  Stay like that.  All right.  Things people like to eat.  She has hairy armpits, by the way.  There we go.  Wow, does she?  All right.  There it is.  Marion, she's got hairy armpits.  I don't live with her.  Tell her to shave.  I shave?  You don't see my legs?  My legs ain't hairy.  Mom, ain't hairy?  No.  All right.  Now.  What do we do?  All right.  You turn around.  Face Marion.  Okay.  Marion, we'll give you clues.

Things people like to eat.  No.  No.  You fucking retard.  Oh, my God.  She just said the answer.  You're supposed to give clues to make her say that.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  It couldn't work out more perfectly. 
[00:05:30]  That's all we were hoping for.  That's the whole bit.  That was the answer, right?  What do you think?  What do you think?  All right.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Holy shit.  I can't fucking take this.  I was joking.  I can't take this.  I did a clue for you.  No, you don't get it.  She misunderstood the rule.  Another show.  Another fucking...  We do know how to play $25,000 pure minutes.  Yeah, we do.  Let's give her another shot.  She didn't understand.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  We'll do it.  We'll do it one more time.  Don't read off the answer.  You've got to give clues, and hopefully Lady Di gives the answer. 
[00:06:00]  The object of this game is for her, Lady Di, to say what's on that paper.  You've got to give her clues, but you can't say any of the words in the clue.  Okay?  You got it.  All right.  Take the headphones off.  All right.  Earmuffs again.  Earmuffs.  Earmuffs.  Earmuffs.  No, you got it.  Cover your ears.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  There you go.  Cover your ears.

Now we move to the next team.  Yeah.  Is that how it works?  Yeah, Bobo and the other.  All right, get up later.  When she said pilot,  I thought it was things Jim Norton doesn't get.  That's amazing.  Pilot, stewardess.  Yeah, you did great.  You did great.  Co-pilot?  Yep.  You did great.  I don't fly, but you got it.  Bobo, come sit down.  I don't try.

Bobo, are you ready to meet your partner?  Bobo, are you ready to meet your partner?  Yep, I am.  All right, Bobo, you will be playing with the lovely Jackie the Intern.  Why do I have to look at him?  Exactly.  Where is Jackie the Intern?  She's not her way.  Did she quit?  I would.  Here she comes, the lovely Jackie the Intern.  Bobo, do you like Jackie?  Yeah, I think I said, Jack. 
[00:08:00]  I said to her that she looks great.  She looks great.  Bobo, why don't you ask her out, man?  Yeah, Bobo.  I would ask her out if she was single.  Oh.  They're having problems, though.  Unfortunately, she's got a guy.  Oh.  They're having issues.  That's terrible.  How long into the conversation did she let you know that?  Yeah, you could take them off and then put your hands over your ears while I give the thing.  And it's like, okay, put your hands over your ears.  There you go.  Things that are funny. 
[00:08:30]  All right, there you go.  There you go.  Put your headphones on.  You ready?  Bobo, you know what you're doing, right?  You know how this game works?  You give clues and don't say the words.  Okay, ready and go.  Monkeys.  Dogs.  Jimmy.  Things that are fucked Bobo.  A zoo? 
[00:09:00]  Jesus.  Keep going.  Things that smell.  Thanks, Jackie.  Someone's slipping.  Funny things.  Funny things.  That's right, Bobo.  I gotta tell you.  Team Dian Marion, 10 seconds.  Team Bobo and Jackie, 33 seconds.  That's because they have such chemistry.  You got a point. 
[00:09:30]  Don't look at Jackie's legs, though, Bobo.  It's disrespectful.  Just for a second.  You can for a second.  Bobo's having such a hard time concentrating.  Bobo, you got anything going on in your pants right now?  No, that's too disrespectful.  That's too disrespectful.  All right, who's up next?  Who's up?  All right, you guys get up.  All right.  We're changing back over again.  I know this isn't exactly like the program was.  To the gargantuan.  I'd like to ask one question in between. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  How does Jimmy feel?  How's Jimmy going to feel when he's sitting there trying to write some new, you know, material?  Like, what's going on in the world?  What do I feel about the world?  When he realizes he was in the same category as farts, people slipping, dogs and monkeys.  Bobo's mind.  That's what Bobo finds funny.  It's going to be a little tough.  Monkeys are hilarious.  It's always funny if there's a monkey around.  All right, we're here.  Why? 
[00:10:30]  There's more Babel.  Oh, Jesus.  He's gold.  I don't want to talk.  Use that microphone.  Oh, that's good.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  All right, here we go, ladies.  Earmuffs.  Earmuffs.

I got my headphones on.  I know.  Di, you got to put your headphones on.  Di, put headphones on and listen.  You're the one giving the clues.  She's going to give the clues to you now.  Oh, my God.  I am?  No.  I don't want to do that. 
[00:11:00]  Don't worry about it.  You have to.  You have to.  You have to.  Easy, Mr. Cheswick.  All right.  Mr. Cheswick.  All right.  Okay.  Plug your ears.  Plug your ears up.  There you go.

No.  Di, read what's on the paper. 
[00:12:30]  Read the thing.  Read what's on the paper.  A periodic table?  Read any table you're sitting on.  What is that?  What does it say?  It says elements on a periodic table, but what is that?  Do you know what the periodic table of elements are?  Gold.  Like the elements.  Like cobalt.  Lead.  Lead.  Hydrogen.  Boron.  I didn't know that.  Nitrogen.  Boron.  She wasn't given enough clues.  She didn't understand.  That was apparent when she just said, what was that? 
[00:13:00]  Yes.  All right.  Let's move on to the next thing.  Sorry, guys.  Sorry.  We don't need a summation.  Take a hike.  You know what was great is even if she was describing this console, they still didn't come  close to you.  Yeah.  Like she didn't even say the table or the console or anything.  I don't know what that was.  I did go with my clothes.  You did.  You did great, man.  You were wonderful.  Thank you.  You were wonderful.  Yeah.  And you had two of them.  You did have two of them in there with water, by the way.  You've got to give her that much.  That's right.  She did have hydrogen and oxygen, so that's not bad. 
[00:13:30]  All right.  Back to Bobo and Jackie.  Bobo and Jackie.  This time, this time, this time, I guess, it's Jackie giving the clues to Bobo.  Okay.  Earmuffs.  All right.  Earmuffs.

[00:22:30]  Oh, yeah.  We're going to be a bottle of wine.  She's got a good point.  Yeah.  Why, you got to christen Lady Di before she leaves?  See, she's a battleship.  The worst of the week countdown.  Countdown.  Counting down all the wonderfulness that was this week's opening.  This is the worst of the week countdown with me, Sam Roberts, from the Opie and Anthony  Show, and after Opie and Anthony Live.  And what a week it was.  Still to come on the countdown, we're going to make fun of E-Rock.  We're going to have Nick Walenda, the tightrope walker, Larry King, and porn star Melanie Monroe 
[00:23:00]  in studio.  More from Lady Di and Marion.  But before all that, right now, let's listen.  As Opie and Anthony analyze Paula Deen's appearance on the Today Show, the Paula Deen firing was  one of the biggest news stories in this insanely busy news week.  I don't know why, but Paula Deen said the N-word one time 30 years ago, and now she's losing  everything.  Let's listen to Opie and Anthony listen to Matt Lauer interview Paula Deen. 
[00:23:30]  Let's go to Are You a Racist?  It literally sounds like Are You Now or Have You Ever Been from...  Right, right.  Or fucking...  Or like McCarthy.  It's like McCarthyism.  Are you a communist?  Yes.  Now it's a racist.  You mean what I just said?  I think...  I don't use the actual term.  I think you're talking about fucking Are You Now or Have You Been a Homosexual from  From Little Jacket.  No, no.  Oh, from Clockwork Orange.  Sorry.  I think you're doing a movie line. 
[00:24:00]  No, it's from...  That's how they said it.  Have you?  Well, I don't remember.  That was your high school days.  How am I supposed to know?  Oh, shit.  Swim off.  As we sit here, it seems to me an informal jury of your peers and your fans and your critics  and your business associates are weighing the question.  Associates?  Is Paula Deen a racist?  So I'll ask it to you bluntly.  Are you a racist?  Yes.  Whoa.  Watch out for Matt Lauer.  Yes, Matt.  I'm a racist.  You're not in the Panjshir Valley interviewing the head of the Al-Qaeda.  But you're going to get hardcore and in-depth. 
[00:24:30]  Idiot.  Idiot.  Idiot.  Ah, shit.  No, I'm not.  By birth, by choice, by osmosis, you don't feel you have racist tendencies.  What a country.  What a country.  Can you believe this?  This is more than TV.  It's...  It's...  It's like fucking white people scolding each other to deflect attention from themselves.  Oh, it's like Vonnegut.  Don't you think everyone's racist to an extent?  Yes.  It depends who you call racist. 
[00:25:00]  Yes, exactly.  I mean, you might have just a little bit or a lot.  It depends who you call racist.  And this makes it worse.  Worse?  I can't.  It depends who you call racist.  I mean, I like to define racism, which nobody could do in this country either, by the way.  I'm called racist every night on Twitter for just criticizing black people.  And they're, oh, you're a racist.  And they honestly think that I'm being a racist.  So their definition is any white person that criticizes a black person is a racist.  Then there's people that need, you know, burning crosses and fucking clan hoods to define a racist. 
[00:25:30]  So, yeah, the definition, it's just not there.  The definition is very all over the place.  Yes.  Don't feel you have racist tendencies.  No.  As a child, I was raised in a home.  Oh, God.  That accent never good when you're being asked if you're a racist.  Let me tell you one thing.  I've been so kind to the Negroes growing up.  I said nigger as a noun, not an adjective. 
[00:26:00]  Exactly.  You know, growing up with the little pickin' in his running around the yard, I think it's just...  That accent is very hard to defend.  The other question I'd like to ask is when they do destroy her, whatever, empire, which is ludicrous that she should have an empire, but she has an empire to begin with, how many black employees does she have that are going to be unemployed?  Right, right, right.  That's the other question.  Yes.  And how do they feel?  They're like, I'd rather have my job and have her have said the N-word during a bank robbery than be unemployed and part of the big solution. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  I don't like your impression of her employees.  That sounded...  That was you doing her employees.  I didn't like it.  I was doing kind of the...  This guy went to one of those black colleges in Atlanta.  I went to Morehouse or to Howard.  Howard.  Howard's the go-to.  He's right.  My impression was pretty ludicrous.  She was robbed at gunpoint.  Am I right?  Right.  Is that what happened?  Yes.  By a black guy.  And she came home and said, I need a dick around.  We're going to give you the store right by.  She's got that great voice like three pack a day. 
[00:27:00]  My father tolerated bad grades.  What?  He would tolerate maybe me breaking a curfew.  Well, this is really irrelevant, but...  How's Matt looking at this point?  Matt looks like he always looks.  Be willed and hostile.  And others or have been unkind.  Your butt is going to be mine.  All right.  But you raised your right hand.  Yes, I did. 
[00:27:30]  And you swore under oath.  And you spoke honestly, which you should never do.  That was the crime.  That was the lesson we all learned.  Don't just lie.  That is the lesson.  Yeah, you can't speak honestly.  Never be honest.  Ever.  Never be honest about the race, especially because you will be hung.  Right.  I'm glad we all learned that, Anthony.  But anyway...  You have used a word that is the most offensive word you can use to describe an African man.  That's nice.  The worst.  This wedding.  This wedding you wanted to plan.  That plantation-style wedding.  Whether you use the...  Well, maybe the plantation-style wedding was a bit much. 
[00:28:00]  A little over the top.  It hurts her case.  A little rough.  A little over the top.  Not good.  A nice period piece.  A little rough.  Hey, you know, they did it in Django.  Yeah.  It worked in Django.  He's like, I want a Django type of vibe.  Django.  Yeah.  So, Okra, we have them sit in a separate section called the Fieldhouse, and then we're going  to sit up here.  Right.  Now, where's the slave hotbox going to be for the big ceremony?  Oh, Jesus.  Is that going to be out there in the yard? 
[00:28:30]  It's the hotbox slash barbecue pit that she had.  It's kind of a bad taste.  I know.  And she goes, I like the fact that she goes, obviously, La Femme, she goes, oh, the media  will be all over me for that one.  Yeah.  Kind of.  Yeah, I think so.  Jeez, Paulette.  Ha, ha, ha.  Or not.  So how does someone use the N-word, whether in anger, or in a joke, or in private, the  most offensive word to African Americans, and not be considered a racist?  When they're using it.  They're using it constantly. 
[00:29:00]  The day I used that word, it was a world ago.  And it was 30 years ago.  Listen to this.  Oh, Rob.  Rob.  I have a excuse.  She said, Matt, I'm going to hold a gun in your face right now, Matt.  Yeah.  I don't know.  And now you call me the B-word.  Yeah, yeah.  How can you say I'll kill you and not be considered a murderer?  Sometimes you say things in anger, Matt.  And this is the point we're at in society, where now you're responsible for something you said  30 years ago.  Yeah.  That's fucking nuts.  If you're the most offensive word for African Americans. 
[00:29:30]  30 years ago.  Yeah, look at Colin 30 years ago.  He's unrecognizable.  Do you have a picture of what you looked like 30 years ago?  Yeah, he tweeted it yesterday.  Really?  Good head of hair.  Colin looks like Philippe Cousteau.  He did.  Back in the 70s.  Somebody said I looked like John Holmes.  We got old John Holmes in you.  Yes.  The old Kyle.  You do from like the face down to the chin.  And then you look nothing like John Holmes.  Oh, my God.  Hopefully you'll wind up like him.  So now we're all going to have to live perfect lives. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, look at that.  It used to be what you were doing in the here and now, but now we're going to go back 30  years.  30 years, she says, nigger.  30 years.  And it's fucking now resurfacing like she fucking buried a dead baby.  Like Sling Blade had to fucking dip that poor little feller.  You know?  Yeah.  Give me a break.  We look at it like it happened last week.  Paula Deen was a teller at the time this whole thing went down.  Yeah.  Yeah, real snitch.  That's a problem.  I had a gun up against my head. 
[00:30:30]  A shaking gun.  Because the man that had the gun to my head, unbeknowing to me, was my customer at the  main office.  And I had gone.  And I had gone.  And I had gone.  And I had gone.  And I had gone.  And I had gone.  And I had gone.  And I had gone.  No.  No.  Wait a minute.  Let me just say something.  Witch hunt.  He wanted to get past that story.  Right.  Yes.  So fast.  Because he feels guilty inside.  Because he knows it's all bullshit.  He's like, oh, let's move on to something else.  This is not part of the narrative. 
[00:31:00]  People might accept that as a reasonable reason to use that word.  Of course they would.  All black people would accept it.  Yes.  Oh, black guy holding this fucking gun in your face.  All black people would accept it.  Are you kidding me?  Exactly.  So, oh, let's get past that to the point where you just said it because, you know, your fucking  guy was walking down the street.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  What a slug cunt.  Other than that one time, in the bank, a robbery attempt.  Always hateable.  You have never used the end.  I have never.  I never.  They asked me in all of my 66 years on earth, had I ever used it. 
[00:31:30]  What the fuck is wrong with this country?  Can I believe this is happening?  Who gives a fuck?  I'm so insane.  So insane.  He was later caught.  Holy shit.  And I had gone out on a limb for him and gotten him alone, and he was frightened that I was  going to recognize him.  So reports that you were asked in that deposition whether you would use the N-word on other occasions  and said, he's like, forget the gun to my robber.  Of course. 
[00:32:00]  Back to the N-word.  Back to the N-word.  Back to the word use.  I answered the question truthfully.  I'm amazed.  Man.  So, you have never used the N-word.  Oh, my God.  Shut up, man.  It's not.  It's just not a part of.  This country's finished.  He's an adult saying the N-word.  Yeah, what a country's finished.  What a fucking dripping, sanctimonious, phony.  And he, though, you can't even.  He's every one of these motherfuckers.  He's just one of every one of these fuckers.  The insanity over this. 
[00:32:30]  It's ridiculous.  Do you believe they were talking about a word?  The only people that should have an opinion on any of this are the mixed race, not Sam types.  The mixed race.  The not Sams, we call them.  Wow.  I.  Wow.  The way he was talking, you would think he was questioning her about a murder or some  kind of Bernie Madoff and Fezzelman thing.  But when he's not in front of the cameras, he knows better.  That's what's frustrating to me. 
[00:33:00]  Let me tell you something.  That's even more evil.  No shit.  He doesn't think that way when the cameras are off.  When Matt Lauer's driving home.  He plays his stupid fucking part.  Matt Lauer's driving home.  He goes through a toll booth.  The fucking guy in front of him's got an easy pass.  The gate doesn't go up.  Holy shit.  Now he's waiting.  Matt Lauer wants to get home.  He's fucking waiting.  And he sees a black guy that works for the fucking bridge and tunnel walking almost backwards.  He's walking so slowly over to that fucking gate to grab his easy pass and put on that 
[00:33:30]  little thing to get the gate up.  He's thinking that word.  He thinks it.  He don't say it.  It might even be fleeting.  But he's thinking it for a second.  There are scenarios where everybody at some point thinks it.  It's just a...  Because it's out there.  You can't not think it.  But I'm saying, but even if people don't think it, it's almost...  It's not even about...  It's once again focusing on this word in any way.  Don't think it.  Right.  Don't think it.  Watch you think it.  Watch you think it in your head. 
[00:34:00]  It's in your head.  Don't think it.  I know.  It's like a purple gorilla.  Don't think it.  Purple gorilla.  Don't think it.  And then all of a sudden you think it.  These people are phony.  They're phony.  They want you to believe that Matt Lauer has never even imagined saying that horrible word.  He's a liar.  Stop it.  What a fraud, man.  What a fraud.  People are saying that she said it more than once 30 years ago.  I know.  I see it.  How many times?  How many times is it acceptable?  I don't know.  How many times is it?  Someone said you're wrong.  She said it more than one time 30 years ago. 
[00:34:30]  I'm sure she did.  Look at her deposition transcript.  I know one thing.  All right.  So then she talks about how the youth are saying the word a lot.  I may have used the word a few times.  I may have studied on it.  Let me ask you about this part of the deposition.  We were asked whether, you were asked whether using the N-word and telling a joke was hurtful.  And you said, quote, I don't know.  Most jokes are about Jewish people, rednecks, black folks.  I didn't make up the jokes.  They usually target, though, a group. 
[00:35:00]  I can't myself determine what offends.  If you made a joke using the N-word, you might be a redneck.  And you might work for the Jews.  Aren't most jokes hurtful, if you really think about it?  Well, yeah.  It's hurtful to somebody.  One said the water's cold.  The other said the water's deep.  I believe one boy was from Arkansas.  What is he talking about?  All jokes are hurtful.  Right.  That's what makes them funny.  What are you talking about?  I told you what Jack Simmons once said when he was doing a joke about Baby Jessica. 
[00:35:30]  It was a while ago.  Oh, wow.  I'm not young.  And he goes, come on, folks.  Whenever they moan, come on, folks.  It's comedy.  Somebody's got to get hurt.  That's true.  And that's true.  Yes.  It's comedy.  And I don't like the fact you said it was Baby Jessica.  It was really Baby Lindbergh.  That's hurtful.  Fucking homework.  Hey, thank God Baby Jessica, though.  Right?  Came out fine.  Thank God.  Thank God.  Did you make fun of Baby Jessica ever in your life?  No, never. 
[00:36:00]  No, you can't.  You can't make fun of that scene.  To you, Greg.  You can't.  You can't make fun of that.  Norton just switches off because he was like a young wannabe comedian, hack, that watched  a few comedy specials and he told his friends he had a Baby Jessica joke for his local dumb  Monster Rain friends before he did comedy.  I got that whole thing just now when he goes, do you ever make fun of Baby Jessica?  You guys go, no.  He goes like this, back to his phone.  No, I was just kidding because it was like the Paladino.  This guy was scolding him.  Have you ever made fun of a baby in a pipe? 
[00:36:30]  No.  Fucking Matt Lauer.  What offends another person?  That last sentence gets me.  I can't myself determine what offends another person.  That really hits to my heart.  That hurts my heart, Matt.  He's saying now.  He's fucking insane.  That her answer, that I don't have any, I don't really know what offends another person.  That got him, man.  Which is a reasonable answer.  He now sits there and goes, how do you not know what I'm saying? 
[00:37:00]  He goes, that really gets me.  Yeah, yeah, that got him.  I got him.  Hey, that was hardcore.  First of all, you're allowed to offend other people.  It's amazing.  You're really allowed to do it.  I know, but not Matt.  You used to be allowed to.  Not Matt Lauer.  Last sentence gets me.  I can't myself determine what offends another person.  Do you have any doubt in your mind that African Americans are offended by the end?  No.  Yes, I do doubt it.  How much they use it?  It's nigga this, nigga that every fucking day out there.  Not that you can't listen to a song without it. 
[00:37:30]  Right.  Right.  That's what confuses a lot of people.  Stop it.  It's not this fucking word that you say.  Stop it.  Stop it.  You say the word.  It's like saying good.  It's like using the word hooah.  I don't know, Matt.  I have asked myself that so many times because it's very distressing for me to go into my kitchens and I hear what these young people are calling each other. 
[00:38:00]  I can't even use the Aunt Jemima's syrup anymore.  I've never joined in on that language.  No.  Joined in.  She's got eight young black dudes working there.  It's very distressing.  Yeah, no kidding.  Yo, pass a column to nickel.  The boy was like, ah, that's just what I was going to say.  All right.  All right, Dan.  Yo, shut the fuck up.  All right.  Yeah, she's going to participate.  Are you kidding me?  Oh, Jesus.  It really is a ludicrous country.  This is insanity.  This is like from the onion. 
[00:38:30]  Listen to the rest of this.  It's amazing.  It's an amazing clip here.  It's Orwellian.  Yes.  No.  Absolutely not.  It's very distressing.  It's very distressing for me because I think that for this problem to be worked on, that these young people.  You're right, though.  The accent is hilarious.  It really takes a lot of time.  These young people, especially the colored ones, like my husband and the sheriff, both tried to pursue that person. 
[00:39:00]  And I'm sorry, but Emmett Tillis did win and a white woman.  You bust up a chiffro, you bust it up and you leave.  You've got to hear the last few.  Yeah, let's see what she's saying here.  These young people are going to have to take control and start showing respect for each other and not throwing that word at each other. 
[00:39:30]  It makes my skin crawl.  How about the fact that Paula Deen, who's like this multi-famous chef, owns all these restaurants, she walks in the kitchen and these brothers don't even flinch.  They're just looking at each other.  That's a hot sauce, nigga.  You're hogging it.  How you doing, Miss Paula?  Hey, man.  Yo, where am I supposed to put this roast, nigga?  You ain't make no room for my ass.  And she's like, but she didn't come off very good either. 
[00:40:00]  She came off kind of like an ass.  But she had no reason that she should have to come off in any way whatsoever.  She sounded phony, but we saw it happen when she was honest.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's trying a little too hard.  She's trying a little too hard.  She's a little desperate now.  You mean to tell me, you don't know that African Americans do not like, they're offended by the word that is used in every song and every movie and every... 
[00:40:30]  It's ridiculous.  Tweet at Matt Lauer, if you know, M. Lauer on Twitter.  Holla at Matt Lauer.  Holla!  You hear the story about the grandson?  What happened?  I want to read you something that Columbia professor John McWhirter wrote for Time Magazine.  He is, by the way, African American.  He wrote, people of Dean's generation can neither change the past nor completely escape their roots in it, any more than the rest of us.  They can apologize and mean it as Dean seems to. 
[00:41:00]  They also deserve credit for owning up to past sins, as Dean did candidly when she could have easily, shall we say, whitewashed there.  Do you ever wish, Paula, that when you raised your right hand and swore to tell the truth in that deposition, that you'd fudged the truth?  You wouldn't have been the first person to ever lie.  Well, yes, I do.  Given the fallout that you've seen over the last week, do you ever wish you'd fudged the truth?  Yeah.  No.  Because there's a couple of kinds of people that I don't like. 
[00:41:30]  Liars.  We know one group.  And that's thieves and liars.  Oh.  And I'll tell you a conversation.  Uh-oh.  Here we go.  That I had with my seven-year-old grandson the other day.  Oh, no.  He had spent the night with me, and I allowed him to stay up later in his bedtime.  Oh, boy.  I said, J.W.  And I said, Jack, honey, you've got Guinea in trouble. 
[00:42:00]  Guinea?  With mommy and daddy when you told them that I had let you stay up late.  And he was playing with my dad.  It sounds like an emotional story.  Anyway, Paula, what else you got?  And he put that app down.  And he looked up at me, and he said, Guinea.  Fuck off, Grandma.  I don't tell lies.  Aw.  Yes, he does.  Uncle Paul.  He's seven years old.  Of course he does.  He's probably playing with himself the minute he left the room. 
[00:42:30]  Take that, stupid.  Oh.  Oh, shit.  That interview yesterday is, everything is wrong right now.  Oh, yeah.  The phoniness of what goes on.  The phoniness.  Orwellian, you're right.  This is Orwellian.  Yeah, it is Orwellian.  Let's get to the end of this, because we're so ridiculous.  I swear to God.  And then we can move on.  We've got, like, four or five more amazing clips from this thing.  Oh, you guys got some more hot topics.  I'm serious.  We've got a lot of stuff going on.  We're rolling.  We're going to move on.  We're going to study that couples that...  Oh, God. 
[00:43:00]  Don't tell lies.  That's how I raised my children.  Sure.  That's how I was raised.  And that's how my grandchildren are being raised.  Fine.  And I know, as well as I'm sitting here with you, I know how I treat people.  I know my love for people.  Cut the cheap sales retorts, Port.  I want information.  Blue Star.  But people of color, I'm not going to do it.  Somebody else can tell that. 
[00:43:30]  All right.  Wow.  The whole country.  I feel like maybe I'm seeing it wrong.  It's so overwhelmingly idiotic.  Sickening.  I can't believe it's happening.  It's easier to see it like everyone else.  Yes.  Because it's so enraged.  The dishonesty of it.  It's so easy just to go along with it and say, fuck it.  Jump in the fucking river and just go with it with everyone else.  The worst of the week countdown.  On the Colby Anthony channel.

Lady Di and Marion, more from them I promise,  but first, Chris Rock was in studio this week, 
[00:49:00]  not to do an interview on the air,  but to film a scene for his new movie with the Opie and Anthony Show.  So, this was all going to happen off the air.  However, it got moved to an on-air segment  when we all realized that our young producer, E-Rock,  decided to show up to work clean-shaven  and dressed about five degrees better than he ever dresses for work,  obviously making an attempt to get on camera. 
[00:49:30]  He said it was a just-in-case scenario.  We trashed him good.  Yeah, another E-Rock bashing segment.  On the Worst of the Week Countdown.  Number six.  Well, speaking of the movie shoot.  Well, yeah.  We all were kind of told to maybe, you know,  like dress a little better than usual, so.  I totally ignored that. 
[00:50:00]  I noticed that.  I'm wearing exactly what I wear every day.  Why would I do anything different?  Because you just got a logo on your shirt.  No, but I have a shirt to cover it up.  Gotcha.  Yeah, they said no logos.  Oh, they did.  I almost forced out.  No logos.  But this is like, it's nothing.  You won't see this.  Right.  It's fine.  I think it's fine.  And, well, obviously it's Opie, I, Jim Norton.  Is that how you say that? 
[00:50:30]  I don't know.  Technically it would be Opie, Jim Norton, and I.  And I, yeah.  Well, I was just doing it because I'm, you know, here.  Why didn't you say me there?  I don't know.  Wait, if you'd say it would be, you know, you'd say Opie, Jim Norton, and me.  But what if he said it the way he said it?  Then it would be.  Then we all think he's an ass like we do.  No, I don't even think he's an ass.  I hate that me-eye thing.  I'm just like, it's me, Opie, and Jimmy.  Thank you.  That's what it is.  There you go.  Yeah. 
[00:51:00]  So that's, you know.  But I guess some people came in knowing that this was going to happen and assumed that  if they dress the part and, you know.  I love how you have a whole story and scenario in your head.  How do you know we're talking about you?  No one was listening, going to break, hearing what this, all this shit was going on.  But you let Anthony finish, please.  I can't even see what he's wearing.  It's a shirt. 
[00:51:30]  It's a plain shirt with a collar on it.  Well, I got a movie that, wait, wait.  Who's that?  We didn't get him in the movie.  Oh, no.  Sam, what's going on?  It's exactly like yours, Jim.  Oh.  Right.  Well.  It's just something you would never.  Sam, what's going on?  Well.  Break it down.  This morning.  Yes.  I was diligently working and Travis said, Sam, did you see what E-Rock is wearing today?  And I said, is it a wrestling shirt or a Doctor Who shirt?  Because that's his usual wear. 
[00:52:00]  Right.  It's his uniform.  We all have an uniform.  Sure, sure.  Yes.  There's nothing wrong with that.  No.  And, uh.  Of course not.  His uniform.  Look at Jimmy.  I love it.  No one gets a fucking break around here.  You can't even dress nice for a movie without being ridiculed.  No.  Just constant ridicule.  Travis, let me know.  Of course.  You gotta look at what E-Rock's wearing.  Can I ask you a question, Sam?  Yeah.  Did it become a bit of a buzz around the joint? 
[00:52:30]  Oh, yes.  Before 6 a.m., which is crazy.  A bit of a buzz.  You can't get a buzz going before 6 a.m.  Oh, they did.  Everyone's just miserable and tired, but there was a buzz in the hallway?  Yeah, it was me, it was Travis, it was Sal, everybody just figured out, look, what's  he going for here?  What's he angling for?  Right.  And what do you think?  The same thing everyone else here is angling for.  Everybody's wearing what they wear every day except you.  Yeah.  Because you wear that dress-up denim shirt all the time.  Oh, shit.  Roland wears pants all the time. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, fuck.  It's not a dress-up denim shirt, it's the same shirt Jim's made fun of multiple times  on the air.  So, yes, I do wear it all the time.  Oh, wow.  There's actually a record of it being referenced.  I've seen that shirt a thousand times.  It's not a special shirt.  But, now, E-Rock, so you're going through this.  I love the smile on your face with this.  He loves it.  I love it.  Don't lick your lips.  It's so funny.  So, E-Rock, what was your thinking when you left?  It's so funny.  What was your thinking? 
[00:53:30]  Right.  What was your thinking, Big Shot?  Well, there's something going on here today, so maybe I shouldn't look like a total piece  of shit and go for a partial piece of shit by wearing just a plain collared shirt.  Plain collared shirt.  You think there might have been a thought that, like, well, you know, sometimes during, what  if, you know, in the movie, they need somebody to come in and, like, take a photo.  And you can talk about your movie.  No.  That's true.  You can start a little conversation about...  Two filmmakers?  Yeah.  Or what if I'm having some small talk in the hallway, maybe? 
[00:54:00]  What if all Chris Rock's character is in here, one of you goes, our producer didn't bring  us the prep sheet.  Oh, wow.  And then E-Rock comes in.  Mr. Fabasham!  Get Sal in here.  I'm sure he's enjoying this, too.  Oh, yeah.  Are you saying he's hoping for a cameo?  Yes.  Are you saying he is hoping for a cameo?  Do you think he'll be good?  Oh, no. 
[00:54:30]  Walking in the door.  No.  Your prep sheet is here.  No.  Sal, what's going on today?  I hear there's a buzz in the hallway.  About what?  E-Rock's shirt.  Oh, yeah.  So how did it go down this morning?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Everyone knows about it.  I mean, E-Rock only gets dressed up like when he's got to go out for dinner or something  like that.  He's wearing a nice shirt today.  Or when he's going to make his Hollywood debut.  He looks good, though.  He looks well put together.  I can't really see.  E-Rock, could you come in here for a second? 
[00:55:00]  I haven't seen this shirt.  It's weird to see him in a collared shirt.  That's a fresh shirt, by the way.  Is it fresh?  He bought that yesterday.  No.  Just for this?  Check for fog marks.  Yeah, it looks pretty sharp.  Just for the...  Oh, yeah.  Oh, look at you.  Oh, that's a really nice collared shirt.  What do you got?  A black shirt under it?  Double shirts, motherfucker.  That is nice. 
[00:55:30]  I gotta say.  Oh, wait a minute.  Look who's clean shaven.  E-Rock.  And your hair is...  You've done your hair today.  My hair's always like that.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Sometimes it's blonde.  I haven't worn that hat in several months.  Okay.  And sometimes the hair is blonde.  Yeah.  For the summer.  That's been two years.  Fresh shaven.  He's always got a little stubble.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Someone's ready to be discovered.  Are you...  Oh.  Jim Norton.  Are you returning the shirt after today?  Is the tag still on it? 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  You know, Cary Grant was a soda jerk.  That's right.  Yeah, when he was discovered, Gregory Peck was an usher in a movie theater.  Right.  He was discovered.  What about here?  Get E-Rock some tequila so he can fight back.  Oh, my God.  Was there a little thought that, like, you know, I might end up walking in on the shot?  No.  We need a producer character.  I didn't want to look like a total piece of shit.  Who can we get?  Who can we get? 
[00:56:30]  You're like Lucy with Desi trying to be in the show.  Of course.  I haven't said a word about trying to do anything with this.  No saying needed, sir.  I'm so glad Mars said, fuck the Hollywood movie fucking shoot today.  I mean, the same shirt I got.  The exact same fucking shirt for Mars today.  And could I have, could Jackie or someone bring me a napkin?  Preferably Jackie, because she seems to do it well.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's just right what you need.  Boom.  Yeah.  Right in.  Right in.  A few napkins.  Oh, that is, uh, so you got, uh, oh, Sam, maybe we need a producer in the, in the studio 
[00:57:00]  at some point.  Yeah, because what difference would it make if somebody looked like a total piece of shit  in a different room?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  If they're not in the room, a guy wants to comment.  Okay.  Oh, okay.  On Iraq's tweets.  Oh.  What's wrong with Iraq's tweets?  I'm not going to beat him up for his tweets.  He's, he does fine.  Where, where is he?  Ah, the phone might be frozen.  Oh, my God.  Yay!  Jackie. 
[00:57:30]  Hey, Jackie.  Aw.  Some napkins.  Home run, Jackie.  Perfect.  Once again, home run.  I gave them to you already.  Thank you, Jackie.  What?  These are soft.  Yeah, no, those are better napkins.  I got to blow my nose.  Those are better napkins, Sam.  You can tell.  You can tell they're better.  They're softer.  They've got great, great hair.  It looks very 60s-ish.  Oh, Iraq?  No, no.  But Iraq does have great hair.  It really does.  I still have my hair, yeah.  I know.  It's fucking, like, nice.  Thick head of hair.  And a kid's fucking Sam.  What?  Don't fucking Sam me. 
[00:58:00]  This is a room full of people.  One of us is honest, though.  I'm being totally honest, but other people are making something out of nothing.  No, no, no.  I wasn't talking about you not being honest.  I was talking about me being honest about having a great time here.  Uh-huh.  Did you do anything before you left the house this morning?  That's right.  With the thought that there was going to be a camera crew in here today?  Yes, that's why I wore the shirt.  Okay.  Now, why would you do that?  You're in a dark room.  Because this never happens here, so I didn't want to look like I usually do. 
[00:58:30]  Well, what would it matter?  Wouldn't you want to present yourself nicely every day?  Because, in the end...  Wouldn't you?  What does it matter?  Unless you would think you're on camera.  But you don't dress nice every day.  A flying...  It's obvious.  I look exactly like I do every day.  I think the difference would be that Jim and Anthony and Opie are going to be on camera.  We'll be on camera.  So the idea is they would dress nice.  If you're saying that they are dressed more nicely than usual, it's because they're going  to be on camera.  And E-Rock, we see nobody and we do dress okay. 
[00:59:00]  You are walking around with these assholes all day long.  So why wouldn't you dress nice in case, you know, it helps your fucking career?  Because it ain't going to help here.  Why then, knowing you probably...  I already said why.  You're not going to be on camera.  Why would you get dressed anyway?  You never know, though.  He's hoping for one of those moments.  You want a moment?  You need a thing brought in, yeah.  Were you hoping for a moment?  Do you have somebody that could bring Chris in and, like, sit him down at the, you know... 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  No, Chris, take a seat.  Mmm.  Coffee.  Mmm.  Yeah, coffee.  Oh, you bring...  Oh, we need someone to bring a coffee into Chris's character during the interview.  Was that what you were hoping for?  This is a plain shirt.  It's not like I dressed up in a suit or something like that.  Well, no, but you consciously...  You need a cup of coffee?  There's a cup of coffee.  Wow.  Enjoy it. 
[01:00:00]  That would be a good one.  See, Travis didn't dress up.  Who's the coffee guy in that movie?  Yeah.  Travis has got a logo shirt on.  Fucking Spielberg will be sitting there.  Yeah.  The coffee guy in the Chris Rock movie.  I've been looking.  Oh.  The best part of all this is that the entire crew that's with Chris Rock, they're all wearing  T-shirts.  Right.  Guy outside's got a flame shirt and shorts on.  Yes.  I've been reincarnated.  Well, it's because none of them are hoping to get on camera. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, no.  So you're saying they're all okay being behind the scenes?  Yes.  Oh.  B-Rock, you just...  There was an inkling.  It's like, look, it might happen.  Yeah, it might.  I better dress appropriately.  You never know.  Who else?  You never know.  There is no...  There's no other reason.  I hope he just starts laughing.  He's like, he's like, you never know.  Well, I like when he's honest.  Yeah.  I do.  I like that he started by saying it's the same thing everybody did. 
[01:01:00]  Everybody's just dressed like they always dress.  There's no difference.  Everybody's wearing the same shirt.  Sal's wearing one of his terrible V-neck shirts.  Oh, yeah.  Horrible.  Yeah.  Sam's got a shirt that I've seen a thousand times.  Do you know who looks great today?  Jackie.  I thought you were going to say me.  Really?  So if Chris Rock...  I haven't seen her yet.  If Chris Rock comes in and says, his character, says, hey, do we have any coffee in here?  Oh, man.  Who are you going to...  Who's going to bring in the coffee?  Where's my cup of coffee?  Is there anybody really well-dressed that can bring Chris's character some coffee? 
[01:01:30]  Oh.  There he is.  But the question is, will Jackie get the part?  Oh, man.  Yeah, who do you want?  Jackie or you?  Jackie would still get the part.  How pissed would collared shirt Eric be if Jackie got the part?  Well, he's got a t-shirt underneath, too, just in case.  Because they may say, we want a more casual look.  Could you come to work tomorrow with a few different looks?  We need different looks.  Do you think...  He just takes it and goes, ridiculous. 
[01:02:00]  Do you think that Eric tried on a couple different undershirts to see what color were gray and white?  You absolutely put on a couple of things, took it off, was like, no.  No, because I'm not a girl.  I didn't imply that, but you're a guy that was very conscious of what you wanted to wear today because this movie's being filmed.  You didn't just throw one shirt on and go, all right, I'm out of the house.  You checked.  You made sure you looked and went, no, you know what?  I'm going to use this shirt, or I'm going to change it to that.  Does that shirt bring out your dreamy eyes? 
[01:02:30]  Bedroom eyes.  Bedroom eyes.  Do you think he gave himself a sparkle blink before he left the house in the mirror?  Sparkle, sparkle.  Can we get that producer kid in the air?  He's good.  No, I love the shirt.  Don't send him a wardrobe.  The shirt's perfect.  Send him in.  Is he?  I hope he's one of the Opie and Anthony guys, right?  Well, even if he isn't, he is today.  He's perfect for the part. 
[01:03:00]  Wasn't he laughing?  That's good stuff right there.  It's too funny.  That's good stuff.  All right.  Lights.  Speed.  Deck.  Wait a minute.  Who's that?  All right, everyone, clear the set.  Bring him in.  That shirt's perfect. 
[01:03:30]  He's almost smiling.  He's almost smiling.  You can see how absurd it would be when taken to that level, right?  Absurd.  That shirt is perfect.  Mr. Director, does he have his own trailer?  What do we got for him?  What do we got for him?  Yeah, yeah.  Rene?  Rene, you want me? 
[01:04:00]  Yes?  Could you set up a trailer for Mr. Nagel?  No, no.  The one that's bigger than the Chris's.  Yeah, that one.  No, no.  Don't send wardrobe in there at all.  He's perfect.  He's already got the shirt.  He thought this out.  It's obvious.  Get him the big trailer.  A honey wagon.  Get him the honey wagon.  I want him to give him the big one.  And, yeah, make sure he's back up here on set because we need him. 
[01:04:30]  Do we need to get him makeup?  Makeup?  I thought he was wearing makeup.  That fresh face is perfect.  And who put that hairpiece on him?  Because it's wonderful.  It's the exact part.  Natural?  That's his?  This is unbelievable.  Hollywood has missed this patch.  Look at that smooth skin and close shave.  It's perfect.  Get him on set. 
[01:05:00]  Ask him what he needs.  You know what?  I don't even think Chris is the right person to play the lead in this movie.  I think we found our new star.  Oh, E-Rock.  Unfortunately, Tony from Brooklyn has a perfect observation.  Oh.  You know.  Unfortunately.  Unfortunately is right.  You'll understand in a second. 
[01:05:30]  Go ahead, Tony in Brooklyn.  Yeah, guys.  You guys, if it was the total opposite, if he didn't get dressed up, he would have came  in normal, like his normal shit.  You guys would have been busting his balls.  Why didn't he get dressed up?  You guys didn't have an opportunity.  Hollywood people come in.  So, E-Rock, unfortunately, you can't win in this movie.  Are you saying the things here aren't fair, sir?  E-Rock is the definition of the no-win situation.  That's right.  Yes, he is the Kobayashi Maru.  Yes, put that on the Wikipedia page.  Well, first of all, there's a problem. 
[01:06:00]  We really need...  Why hasn't the craft service guy shown up?  Oh, he has.  Oh, where's all the food?  It goes there.  That's unfortunate.  That's unfortunate.  Oh, my goodness.  This is exciting, right?  Well, you look great, E-Rock.  You look great.  You look great.  A million bucks.  Were you surprised that a buzz picked up so early this morning? 
[01:06:30]  No, because you have nothing else to do.  Oh, man.  As soon as I walked past your office, I wasn't even halfway to the hallway, and I hear this  twink over here.  Did you know what it was about?  Of course I knew what it was about.  Because as soon as I got down here and turned around, all I see from their office is Scott  going like this.  I was like, of course.  This is where it's going.  How cruel.  The worst of the week countdown on the Opie and Anthony Channel.

[01:11:00]  The worst of the week countdown.  No!  Continues.  Rolling on with the worst of the week countdown,  where we count down all the great moments that happened this week on the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm Sam Roberts from that very show, as well as after Opie and Anthony live.  And you can hear my show, the Sam Roberts show, every Sunday here on the Opie and Anthony channel,  starting at 4 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.  Still to come on this countdown.  More from Lady Diane Miriam. 
[01:11:30]  Larry King in studio.  Nick Walendo, who walked across the Grand Canyon, in studio.  But speaking of in-studio, right now, let's listen as Melanie Monroe,  big-time porno star, queen of the milfs, even though she doesn't have any kids,  stops by the studio.  We're looking for bitches that we can get on the bus for our upcoming bus trip this fall.  Does she make the cut?  And how does she react to Chip and his grubby little hands? 
[01:12:00]  Here she is.  Not he is.  I don't care about Chip.  It's Melanie Monroe on the worst of the week countdown.  Number five.  Maybe a little Beach Boys in the background.  Okay.  That's good for an opening scene of a porn.  Yes.  Let's go different.  Aruba, Jamaica.  Something like that.  Don't you want to rape her?  I think the music is the irrelevant part.  Yeah, yeah.  The music isn't real.  Who starts?  Who starts?  I'll stop.  Me and Jimmy are walking to my house.  I mean, Chip.  Your name's Chip.  Chip.  That's his name for the thing. 
[01:12:30]  Really?  All right.  That's a weird name.  Hey, dude, I've got to go to my house for a sec before we go to the game.  You cool with that, Chip?  What do you got to get from your house?  I've got to go to the bathroom.  Oh, look.  You can go to the bathroom, but don't do what you did last time.  All right?  I couldn't help it.  It clogged the toilet.  It ain't my fault.  All right.  Well, listen.  You can use the bathroom.  Use the one downstairs.  My mother calls me the double flusher.  I've got to double flush everything.  Your mother's such an asshole.  All right.  Listen.  We're going to go to my house.  My mom's home.  Don't be so fucking gawky this time. 
[01:13:00]  All right?  Can't help it.  She's really pretty.  I know she's pretty.  She makes my peck a jump.  Hey, hey.  Chip, it's my mom.  Remember she had to get me the plunger?  That was so embarrassing.  Yeah.  I know.  Come on.  Listen.  Use the bathroom downstairs.  So we're going to go in.  Just be cool.  All right?  Okay.  Ma, how come you don't have the keys to your own house?  I lost them.  I lost them last week. 
[01:13:30]  Why are you not kidding?  I'm doing a back story.  It's a back story.  I want to see your fucking house.  I want to see your mother.  She's wonderful.  Hey, Ma.  Hi, boys.  Hi, boys.  Hey, what's up, Ma?  Come on in.  I got Chip with me.  Remember Chip?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  He's such a cutie.  Hey, what's up, Miss Monroe?  Always a little nervous around me, though.  He is.  I ain't nervous.  I don't give a fuck.  Hey, I got to go.  I got to.  Oh, I forgot my books at school, Mom.  Okay, well, go get them, and I'm going to keep Chip here.  I need some help.  What about my fucking books?  I'll get your books, too, Chip. 
[01:14:00]  I don't like my books.  School for queers.  All right, listen.  But Chip, Miss Monroe needs help moving some boxes from the garage.  I hope they ain't heavy, though.  I hurt my fucking back, Miss Monroe.  Well, I'll give you a back massage if you need it after.  Okay, but careful.  I got a cyst.  Yes.  Jesus.  I like it so far.  It's got a cyst.  I'm not feeling.  The backstory's good.  I'm not feeling this sexy yet. 
[01:14:30]  For sure.  It's coming.  It's coming.  All right, well, come with me into the garage and remove your shirt so I can take a look  at this cyst while you're doing so.  Okay.  I get embarrassed, though.  You know, look at my body.  It's probably not that good.  No, it's okay.  You're just such a little cutie.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Thanks a lot.  I got a port wine stain.  You look so nervous.  I am a little bit nervous.  My hands are sweating.  Okay, well, I'll just show you how to pick up the boxes. 
[01:15:00]  You just kind of like bend over and pick it up.  And make sure that you use your legs and not your back.  Careful, your underpants are showing you.  That little pink string, Chip?  That little bitty pink string?  Yeah, that's way too small.  My mother wears big underpants.  They cover her and she's a very Rubenesque woman.  I bet she's a sweetheart.  But you know if I wear the big pants.  Yeah, she has big ankles.  She can lift a safe up the flight of steps.  She's very strong. 
[01:15:30]  How do my ankles look?  You got very nice ankles.  Careful, your feet are hitting my pecker.  She got very nice ankles.  You like my ankles?  I do, they're really nice.  Hey, your toes are blue.  What are they, cold or something?  Fucking home run, Chiperson.  That's my sexy hot single MILF look.  What's a MILF?  A MILF?  Yeah.  That's a mother I'd like to fuck.  That's what you would do.  Oh, that's very crass.  I don't go for that talk.  No, you don't?  Can I see your feet without the shoes? 
[01:16:00]  Hey, look, your shoes are made of wick.  What are they, chairs or something?  Oh, those are just some Louboutins.  What, Louboutin?  Who's Louboutin?  Nothing special.  Oh, is he friends with Frank Bouton?  Okay, take your shirt off.  It's time.  I don't want to.  I'm embarrassed.  I get a big port wine stain and a cyst.  And I sweat, I perspire a lot.  Can I see your feet?  Yeah, you can see my feet.  I don't have a foot fetish or nothing, but my mother makes me rub her toes after a hard 
[01:16:30]  day's work.  Oh, no.  Yeah, she said that sometimes Lamar holds them too tight and they're really sore.  These may be a little bit more enjoyable for you.  Oh, these are very lovely toes.  Oh, thank you.  My mother makes me do the little piggy game on her.  Oh, no.  You should spend more time over here with my son, seriously.  Yeah.  He's cool, though.  Sometimes I go into the basement and he wants me to watch him tug his pita.  One time behind a washing machine, he pulled down my pants and was rubbing his pecker on 
[01:17:00]  my backside.  He said he was going to pop my cyst with his pecker.  And he had me bent over.  I got tied all over my shirt.  You sound so stressed out, sweetheart.  Why don't you take down your blue jeans and let's just do it all.  Because I'm scared.  Don't be scared.  I got you.  I'll guide you through it all.  Oh, you want to see my you-know-what?  Yeah, I want to see you.  I'll give a fuck.  I'll take it out.  The penis.  Let me see it all, sweetheart.  It's fucking big.  It is?  Yeah.  Fucking huge.  People tell me that fucking pecker should be in a museum or something, Chipper. 
[01:17:30]  That feels so good.  Yeah, I'm rubbing your feet.  Is your penis getting hard?  No, I have erectile dysfunction.  Oh, no.  Because sometimes I was taking medication for my anxiety and it dries out my mouth and  gives me erectile dysfunction.  So sometimes I got to try to put it in soft.  I can do that.  Put my wet, juicy lips on it.  Fuck.  I bet I'll cure that erectile dysfunction. 
[01:18:00]  Fuck, yeah.  Yeah.  Get juicy, wet.  Like two fucking nice slugs crawling up and down my pecker stairs.  My panties are wet at this point.  Fuck, yeah.  I know that.  People tell me I'm the cooter dampener.  I get a cooter so sloppy and wet it looks like someone threw a bucket of lard on it.  And the set up is over and cut to sex.  This is fucking hot, though.  We're getting there.  It's getting good, man.  We're getting there.  Mom. 
[01:18:30]  Mom.  What are you guys doing?  Oh, you got to go upstairs, Ms. Monroe.  He wants him and I to fool around a little bit.  Sometimes we play spin the bottle and he makes me kiss him on the mouth, Ms. Monroe.  Oh, no.  Chip, that's not true.  I don't like that at all.  Chip, it's not true.  I don't like kissing your son on the mouth.  I don't do that, Mom.  Hey, Chip, let's practice kiss.  That's lies.  I'm going to leave.  I wish Dad was here.  We're going to have to have a talk.  I don't like practice kissing.  I'm rubbing her feet, though. 
[01:19:00]  They're very nice feet.  I know.  I noticed the Chip character is really getting into rubbing your feet there.  Am I hurting your feet?  I know.  It feels incredible.  Yeah, my mother would make me rub her feet.  Sometimes she has big bunions.  She would say, look, Chip, I'm my sixth and seventh toe.  I would kiss her bunions.  You're so silly.  Oh, man.  I hope you don't talk when we start fucking.  Whoa.  No.  I talk with my pecker.  I just say, yeah, fucking pick that shit.  Let your pecker do the talking.  Fuck, yeah. 
[01:19:30]  I give a good fuck.  Holy shit.  It's the face you're making.  It's great.  Yeah.  You should see me when I'm licking a cooter.  I'll look right up in your eyes.  Look at me.  Look at me.  It's the sexy glances.  That works well.  The staring is going to really just make it awkward.  I could see your cleavage, though.  I didn't mean to look.  Can you see my titty sweat?  Yes, Miss Monroe.  I can.  I was looking at that one time.  I was over here.  Remember one time when your son was... 
[01:20:00]  I came over one time, and Bobby was sick.  Remember, he was in a hospital.  He was really sick.  We thought he was going to die, and you was going to go see him.  And I said, why don't you stay here first and show me your you-know-whats.  Don't tell all of our secrets.  This is fucking good, right?  You liking it?  Fuck yeah.  Yeah, I bet you are.  Cocksucker went to market.  This motherfucker stayed home.  Oh.  She had a nice...  No, you know, in a porno, at this point, it would be on in action time. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You'd have to fucking start fucking.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I'm rubbing her feet pretty good.  Yeah, it's good.  Yeah.  Should we get the ass involved, or what?  I already am.  That is quite the ass.  That is quite the ass.  You should do the ass.  You should rub the butt.  I think I'm going to rub my butt on your penis.  Oh.  Oh.  Just kiss the fuck.  Yeah, kiss the toe.  Nice.  Did you enjoy that cocoa butter lotion?  I fucking did. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  Is that what that is?  Yeah.  I don't smoke that cocoa butter.  Yeah.  It's cocoa butter and a little bitter apple so my puppies don't bite my toes.  Does that stop your dogs from biting your feet?  Oh, yeah.  I've got bitter apple all over my house.  You know what else would stop the dog from biting your foot?  You kick him.  Your foot.  Yeah.  Or you put milk on your pecker, chipper.  Oh, but that's not what you do.  Wow.  All right.  I'm just getting up right in your lap.  Wow.  Let me get a chip.  Oh, boy.  Look at that, uh, that, uh, yes, right there.  Yeah.  Wow.  It's really nice. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah?  Wow.  Yeah.  You're digging that?  Yeah.  A lot of the movies, uh, wow.  A lot of the movies, like, focus on your butt there?  Yeah.  There's some, there's some movies where it's like, it's all about the ass.  All about your ass.  I just did.  Oh, is it, why, is it going up?  No, I'm just, I'm sitting off to the left.  Okay.  Sitting on your penis?  How big is it?  No, no, no.  I was just.  That's 145 pounds on you, buddy.  I have to fix my penis.  It's not in you.  There we go.  Exactly.  No, no.  I zipped, I zipped up the head and I got a scamp on it. 
[01:22:00]  More romance.  I was in a rush.  We're going to double up the condoms on this one.  I was, I was, I was in the bathroom and the fire alarm went off.  So I zipped up the hole over my pecker by mistake.  Oh, that'll hurt.  I'd go to a hospital.  Yeah.  What about my bum hole?  Are you going to do my bum hole?  Whoa.  Yeah.  I'm going to put my pecker in there.  Ass play.  No, no fear of dick in the ass, right?  Um, for four years, I never did a bum hole scene.  And, uh, two weeks ago, I did my first one for Evil Angel. 
[01:22:30]  Two weeks.  Oh, wow.  How was it?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Wow.  Who at Evil Angel?  Let's get some flowers.  Evil Angel is a company.  No, no, I know.  But who at Evil Angel?  Mike Adriano.  Oh, I don't know.  Yeah.  Big, big dick?  It was, yeah.  Yeah.  He's a very nice size.  Oh, she's sexy.  How'd you take it?  Was it good?  Was it good?  They gave me an anal training kit.  So it was like five.  What is that?  It's five rubber penises.  It's an application for here.  You know, your bum hole is a muscle, so you've got to stretch it out to get ready for this. 
[01:23:00]  Was it like those Russian dolls?  You're not similar, but more pointy.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  You can do the same thing with your mother's shampoo bottles.  Yes, you can.  Oh, shit.  Go on, hairbrush.  Chip on my hairbrush smells.  Have you been at it again?  Oh, no.  It's like you two have to do lunch.  Yeah, you guys should do lunch.  You should do a little lunch.  Yeah.  That's right.  Lunch is good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe have a little lunch.  Ah.  Lunch.  That's what you say.  You say regular things in a sexual kind of a tone. 
[01:23:30]  You want to maybe get a little hummus?  Yeah.  What's that?  What's that?  Eating pussy sock again, Chip?  Yeah.  Hold on.  We've got to get this on film.  It's fucking...  Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.  You open up that fucking cooter, you take your nails, you gotta dig your fingernails into  the lips and you open them, and you wrap your nails in them so they can't come out and  you just fucking fuck going, hang on, hang on, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, fuck,  lick, fucking lick, lick, lick, you do that until she fucking comes all over her leg. 
[01:24:00]  How does it go?  Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, fucking lick, lick, fucking lick, and then her fucking cooter  gets so wet that you could fucking, whatever, put a slip and slide on it.  Oh, slip and slide.  I'm telling you, you throw this over a beat, it's a hit song.  Oh, yeah, yeah, very good.  Good to know.  Fantastic.  Melanie Monroe is a trooper.  She's fantastic.  Fucking Chip could suck the sexuality out of the room.  Did Chip ruin the sexy vibe?  Oh, God.  No.  My panties are still wet, so we're good. 
[01:24:30]  He brought it back.  Oh, no, you should probably be careful because you're going to get chafed.  My mother one time had her thighs and vagina chafed.  That would be horrible.  She's incontinent.  A lot of times she'll wet herself on the bus.  See?  Just like this.  Like the end of the night cowboy.  Well, that's what happens to me in the summertime if I wear this.  I like to wear tights or pants because they're little short shorts custom.  My thighs, they're very thick and round like turkey legs, and they rub together in the summer  and they get red.  Yeah, it just gets like a little...  You got to put salve on them. 
[01:25:00]  Salve.  My mother would have me rub salve on her thighs.  Talking about his mother and salve.  Chip, but my thighs are raw.  Whatever turns you on, baby.  I was doing it because she's a very good woman.  Why don't you stop talking about your mother?  You know, she's an asshole.  You've got a beautiful girl here.  Melanie Monroe is very lovely.  You're supposed to talk to her all nicely and, you know...  Talk to her, Chip.  She's right there.  You're very beautiful.  Oh, see?  That's nice.  Hold her hand.  That's good, Chip.  Hold her hand, Chip. 
[01:25:30]  No, hold her hand.  Not the finger.  You fucking alien.  I'm holding her fucking hand.  What the fuck?  Like he's guiding someone across the street.  That's the worst.  He's really terrible.  Oh, she's rubbing your hand.  Yeah, she's petting my hand like it's a small giraffe or something.  Humor's good, too, Chip.  You're doing good.  That's a good one, Chip.  Yeah.  Now, don't screw up this sexual vibe you've got going now.  His palms are sweaty.  He's...  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  My palms are wet like I've been fucking...  Like I've been juggling with wet avocados or something. 
[01:26:00]  Stop.  Don't try that.  Now, compliment her.  Talk to her nicely.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You've got fucking great hair.  Thank you.  I love my little Bob haircut and my bangs.  Who's Bob?  Cracking himself up again.  He's touching my dad's name.  Oh, cool.  Oh, no.  My mother's name is Dolores.  Stop bringing mom.  Don't bring your mother up.  Don't bring your mother up.  It's not sexy.  Yeah.  Okay.  Talk to her about how sexier...  My mother's hot.  She runs a marathon.  How old is she?  She's 58, but she's banging. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I fuck her.  No, Chip.  Chip.  Talk to her about how sexier body is.  Yeah.  Talk to her about her lips.  Your body is fucking so hot that I would fucking tear it up.  Thank you.  We should tell her...  Talk to her about her lips, Chip.  How sexier her lips.  How you like to kiss them.  Yeah.  I'd love to fucking smooch with you until the cows come home.  He's in case of all...  I'd fucking lay in bed and just fucking smooch with you while the TV's on.  He's growing on me.  He's growing on me.  Yeah.  I'd fucking stick my tongue down your throat so far that it would come out your fucking... 
[01:27:00]  Your cooter.  My cooter?  I think, once again, you're kind of blowing the whole vibe here, Chip.  What a fun personality.  Thank you.  Wonderful.  I love my job.  I'm having so much fun.  This is my sexual peak.  My website's really cool because it's very interactive.  It's the only place where when you join, you can actually private message me.  You can tell me what kind of porn you want me to make for you.  Because I get to create whatever I want.  Yeah.  And I'm on their live webcam all the time. 
[01:27:30]  And if you're a member, it's free.  Damn.  I mean, it's a good deal.  You're watching fucking jack off while you're watching.  Yeah.  You pump your PETA until you fucking shoot it all over the top of your slip flops.  And your body goes, what happened?  She's so silly.  Ah, Chippa.  So, yeah.  Go to her website.  Go to MelanieMonroe.com.  It's nice to see.  To someone like you, it'd probably be very fun to interact with live like that.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  You can tell she's like a real pervert.  She's not fake.  Thank you.  You can tolerate a lot of silliness. 
[01:28:00]  I'm nasty.  I'm pretty nasty.  I was pent up.  I had one boyfriend that I was faithful to 12 years ago.  Damn.  Was he shredded?  I'm getting it all in.  Like a UFC fighter?  No.  Did he have a big penis?  No.  Really?  Wow.  Did he hunt fucking possum?  And it was from...  Wow.  It was...  He was a DJ.  He was way more into that than anything else.  But, you know...  Don Johnson?  This is what...  He was just thinning one.  He would never...  I would never get to finish, so...  Oh, DJ.  He was a damn Jew.  My mother always said,  Chip, I'd enjoy Kiteburgers, so take all your pennies. 
[01:28:30]  Jesus Christ.  Chip.  You never got to finish?  I never got to finish, so once we would do our little two-minute thing, he would go and  take a shower and I would sneak into the walk-in closet, shut the door, hold my breath and  wait and make sure you didn't come out, and I would masturbate and finish off.  Whoa.  That's pretty hot.  So now I'm super sexual.  It's like...  Whew.  Damn.  What would he just fucking...  Blah, blah, blah.  What would he sing when he was in the shower?  I don't know. 
[01:29:00]  He would lock the door.  Fuck, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick,  lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick.  Wow.  Yeah.  I make a girl cum so many times, she don't want to do nothing but fucking cum again.  I mean, I got that same thing that I do get sometimes.  You know, for 12 years I got that, oh, you're just so sexy, I couldn't hold it.  Oh, okay.  Oh, my God.  I have to say that sometimes, and it's like, then I got to take my pants off and have them  washed.  Oh, my gosh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  One time I came while I was high-fiving a girl. 
[01:29:30]  That's happened to me before.  I was the coach of a soccer team.  Are you a size queen?  What do you mean?  Not you.  I'm actually, I have a, because I do so many squats in the gym, I get that, you know, my  pussy muscle gets, you know, I do, I'm nasty, I can't help it.  So I do a lot of kegels when I'm doing all those squats and all the kickboxing, so it's  really, really tight.  So the big ones, I'd rather a regular-sized penis, in all honesty. 
[01:30:00]  I want a regular-sized penis because I can sit on it all the way, the Texas cowgirl.  Hang on one second, what's a regular?  Fucking 15 inches, right, Bob?  Wink.  Six, six, seven.  Yeah, that's how wide the head is on mine.  I mean, that's average, right?  One potato, two potato, three potato?  I can fold a pillow in half, write it, and come, so a penis size is really better.  I don't sleep too long.  I got apnea.  It doesn't...  I'll put you to sleep.  As long as she's talking about chip.  He's trying to relate to the conversation, but he's missing it. 
[01:30:30]  He'd sit on his face with that ass, so it'd help us sleep at me.  Oh, man, right?  No, I couldn't breathe that way, Bob.  No, yeah, you would stop breathing.  Yeah.  If I go get off, I can't breathe.  That's my point.  Yeah, a girl put a butt on my face one time.  She's like, go ahead and chip off.  I'm like, it's the face.  You gotta get your butthole over my face.  I feel like there's a bunch of raccoons dancing on my face or something.  He fucking hated it.  He just doesn't understand.  My fucking head hurts right now. 
[01:31:00]  My fucking head hurts.  Yeah.  I put my finger in a girl's butt and she tightened up and dragged me around the room.  He was cracking up.  She dragged me over to a coffee table.  He really took all the sexuality out of it.  I'm fine now.  I just want to go home to my baby and my wife.  Oh, my God.  You just start getting into a conversation.  Go ahead.  I ain't trying to fuck in a feed.  Say what you want.  I'm just trying to help.  And then he goes into a horrible conversation. 
[01:31:30]  No, you're hilarious.  I'm loving it.  I'm trying to help out.  No.  Yeah.  Maybe Melanie has a question for Chip.  Or any of the guys.  I don't want to talk about me.  Yeah, Melanie, what do you got?  What do you want to ask?  Are you single or married?  There you go.  That's a very good question.  Fuck yeah.  What does that mean?  Either or Chip.  Which one?  Oh, she didn't specify.  She did.  I'm single.  You're single?  Love to mingle.  Oh, no.  I'm the same way.  I'm very single, too.  I eat pringles.  Oh, horrible line.  Maybe ask him what he likes to do on a date, Melanie. 
[01:32:00]  I know you like to go to eat.  Fuck yeah.  Cuda.  What else do you like to do?  Fuck.  Me too.  Stick it in fucking deep.  As a single man, how many times a week are you having sex?  Hundreds.  You beat me.  Fuck yeah.  You beat me.  He's a compulsive liar.  Go ahead.  When I'm home in New York, I don't, you know, I rarely date.  It's very rare.  I wish I could date more.  I'd like to.  Yeah, I'm always on dates. 
[01:32:30]  You live in New York?  I do live here.  Look at that.  I live right down the street.  Wow.  Yeah, me too.  Yeah?  Yeah.  We probably live in the same building.  I live in the Trump house.  Oh, nice.  Oh, I'm not that fancy.  On 30th Avenue.  Okay.  Could you imagine being neighbors with her?  Fuck yeah.  I'd drill a hole in that wall.  What, yeah?  Quicker than you can fuck it.  There's a famous four stars in my building as well.  Really?  For more of the O.E. and Anthony rumors to the week on time, next.

[01:37:30]  I told you this was a great week.  It's Sam Roberts from the Opie and Anthony Show and After Opie and Anthony Live presenting  the Worst of the Week Countdown, where we bring you all the great moments that happened  this week on the O&A Show.  A lot still to go.  More from Lady Di and Mariam.  I always say Mariam.  It's Marion.  Nick Walenda, the tightrope walker.  But first, right now, I want to play for you Larry King in studio, a broadcasting legend,  a guy we used to make fun of a lot until we realized he's one of the best guests 
[01:38:00]  we've ever had in studio.  Larry King on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, that's the guy who wraps the intro for Opie and Anthony, by the way.  The Friday intro.  That's really Larry King.  And he's really back on the show right now.  You ever mentioned it by an interview?  No.  The only time it was momentarily was the first 30 seconds with Sinatra.  Wow.  Because Jackie Gleason and I have got Sinatra for me. 
[01:38:30]  Right.  It's a great story.  Well, Larry, I've got to fill you in.  You did tell it last time.  I know.  It's a great story.  Okay.  Why are you yelling at Larry?  No, I didn't hear it.  I wasn't here last time.  Yes, you did.  I apologize for him, Larry.  You're yelling at Larry King.  What's going on with you?  Well, hold on.  He can yell at me.  He's helping me.  Are you Opie?  Yes.  Yes.  Opie, I want to tell you something.  Yes.  Sometimes it pays to listen to you.  Anthony is your elder.  He said elder.  Elder. 
[01:39:00]  I like that.  Now, what Anthony was doing there was helping me.  I was protecting Larry.  What he was saying to me, don't embarrass yourself.  You've told the story before.  And then you're going to seem like you're redundant.  Yes.  If he asked me, we ever intimidated him.  So I said yes, the first time I interviewed Sinatra.  Right.  And then I thought of the story.  Right.  But I had forgotten that I had told it here.  Yes.  You tell a lot of, yeah, yeah.  Helpful Anthony.  I tried to be helpful.  Helpful Anthony.  I tried to be helpful.  I want to hear a Jackie Grayson story.  You're missing the important thing is that he's going to stand up and say, what does redundant  mean? 
[01:39:30]  Sorry, Rich.  It's all right.  You know what?  Anyway.  I would say that the first time in the White House.  Right on.  Doing an interview in the White House was a little intimidating.  In the White House.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's got to be.  What president was that?  In the White House was, I interviewed Reagan and Nixon after the White House.  In the White House was Bush 41.  Oh, okay.  And Barbara Bush, who became a very good friend of mine, came over to me and said, suspenders  in the White House. 
[01:40:00]  Really?  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  And I said, that's my gag.  That's my gab.  That's what I wear.  How many presidents did you interview?  Seven.  It's seven.  Which seven?  You've got to go.  Well, go Nixon, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Carter, Bush, too, and Obama.  Remember Ford?  Oh, and Ford.  Who's the most charming?  Clinton.  Clinton?  By far, right?  Yeah.  You could hate Bill Clinton, despise his politics, think he has no character, and I'll put you 
[01:40:30]  in a room with him for five minutes.  You'll love him.  He also was a great president.  He knew how to balance his life.  He overcame great things, and he's regarded now as a president people miss.  Yeah, yeah.  He did wind up, you know, everyone thought that scandal, his little sex scandal there was going  to ruin his legacy, but it just goes to show how good of a job he did as president, that 
[01:41:00]  he overcame that as far as history goes.  Have you ever, when you interviewed a president or something, and you said, you know, they're  all such charismatic, powerful speakers.  Have you ever kind of had an uncomfortable moment with one where you wanted to make a  political point, or where there was kind of a push and pull between you and one of those  guys?  I never had a problem with presidents are easy, because they've made it to the top.  And they don't, it's kind of funny, they're in a position where they don't need you. 
[01:41:30]  You know, you need them, they don't need you.  And I've always had a good time.  Some are better than those.  You know, Clinton was very good.  Carter was very bright.  Reagan was very human.  Right.  I remember talking to Reagan about, well, I always try to ask human questions.  I was just, I always felt that I was, the public would ask.  I'm just a man of the people.  They call, New Yorker, the story, I mean, they call it street talk.  So Reagan, I asked, what was it like to be shot? 
[01:42:00]  A lot of people would want to know that.  Yeah.  Sure.  But some might say, well, can I ask him that?  Can I?  And then, you know, he said, I didn't know I was shot.  That's amazing.  Because I heard a kind of sound and the Secret Service guy pushed me so hard  that I thought the pain was from the push.  The pain was from the bullet.  I asked questions that the public would ask.  I'm just a man of the people.  They call, New Yorker, the story, I mean, they call it street talk.  So Reagan, I asked, what was it like to be shot? 
[01:42:30]  A lot of people would want to know that.  Yeah.  Sure.  But some might say, well, can I ask him that?  And then, you know, he said, I didn't know I was shot.  That's amazing.  Because I heard a kind of sound and the Secret Service guy pushed me so hard  that I thought the pain was from the push.  The pain was from the bullet.  Yeah, yeah.  I just saw, recently saw a documentary on that whole shooting and it was an amazing story.  The bullet actually hit the door of the limo, flattened out, and then entered his side 
[01:43:00]  in such a little slit pattern.  It wasn't a bullet.  And that's why they had such a problem even realizing he was shot and finding it.  Because it ended up like a little coin slot.  Yeah.  Went right in him that way.  Not too far from the heart.  Right.  Yeah.  Very dangerous.  I was taken to that same emergency room, the Ronald Reagan room, when I had my heart  attack.  Really?  Yeah.  They took me into that same room.  Wow.  And that emergency room is named after Nancy Reagan now. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, it is?  Yeah.  At George Washington Hospital.  When did you have a heart attack?  Oh, what a story.  In 1987, I was a smoker, a three-pack-a-day smoker.  And I stopped smoking that day.  Cigarettes could be the worst thing that anyone could do to themselves.  Three-pack-a-day, I was an idiot.  But I liked it, and I was smoking.  Anyway, I finished the television show, and the guest was C. Everett Coop.  Oh, God.  The surgeon general.  Come on.  I swear to God.  And he says to me, you don't look good. 
[01:44:00]  I said, what do you mean?  He said, I don't like the way.  You're still smoking?  I said, yeah.  He says, wow.  You got a great pallor.  You go to see a doctor.  And what did you go?  You go, what does he know?  I said, no, I appreciate it, thank you.  And I had to go do the radio show.  I'm doing both.  So I'm doing my CNN show.  Now I go do the radio show.  And David Halberstam, the late David Halberstam, wonderful writer.  I finish with him, and he says, are you feeling okay?  Wow.  I said, what do you mean?  He said, you don't look good.  So I go back home, and I was doing the all-night show. 
[01:44:30]  It's like 5 in the morning, and I started to get this pain.  Not in the chest, but in the right shoulder.  Oh, boy.  And the pain is going down the right shoulder.  It was terrible pain.  And so I called up my doctor, and he said, that could be gallbladder, because gallbladder  has refracting pain, and the pain can go to the arm.  He says, go over to the emergency room.  By this time, it was like 7 in the morning.  So I called my producer, and he came and got me, and we drove over to George Washington  University Hospital, where Reagan was taken. 
[01:45:00]  And as we're pulling in, the pain goes away.  Actually, and I'm smoking.  Smoking a little.  Oh, my God.  Smoking a little.  Smoking a little.  Smoking a little.  Smoking a little.  Smoking a little.  Smoking a little.  Smoking a little.  The pain goes away.  So I said, let's pull out, and we'll leave.  I'm fine.  It was a.  Oh, you were right there.  And what happens is a cop says to her, you got to move the car.  So she said to me, the producer, why don't you go in?  See, just go in, and I'll pull around.  So I said, okay, I don't have to go in.  I'm not in pain.  So I go in, and there's a lot of people in the emergency room. 
[01:45:30]  It's snowing February morning.  And this guy comes over.  Good guy.  You know what I mean?  He says, are you okay?  Now, that's the third, are you okay?  Wow.  He says, I don't like the way you look.  And what they have is spotters in the emergency room, so you don't have to wait on line.  Most of the triage.  It could be a guy with a broken arm, another guy with a heart attack, so they took me right  into this room where Reagan was taken, and they started doing tests, and this cardiologist  came down. 
[01:46:00]  He said, I don't like the way you look.  I know you've had the pain.  You're not having it now.  I think it might be serious.  I'm going to ask you to do something.  Don't leave.  I'll stay here with you, because I think that pain's coming back.  When it comes back, we're going to take some blood tests.  So they hooked me up, ready to take blood, and he said, it's going to come back.  We sat there.  We talked about sports for about a half hour, and suddenly, whack, here come the pain.  Wow.  And the pain comes back, and it's going right down my right arm, and they take these blood  tests, and then they go across the room, and they're looking at the results up on a chart, 
[01:46:30]  and I'm sitting there, and my producer's standing next to me, and suddenly, a blue light  goes off.  Wow.  And they all turn around, the doctors and nurses, and they come running toward me, and  it's funny how humor works.  I leaned over to the producer and said, I don't think this is a pulled muscle.  Oh.  That's right.  And the doctor came right over and said, and you never forget that moment, Mr. King, you're  having a heart attack.  Jesus.  And I said, am I going to live? 
[01:47:00]  Hmm.  And he said, good question.  He said, that's why they pay you the big bucks, to ask good questions.  That's what he said.  We don't know.  The next 24 hours is telling.  The lucky part is, it's a right side heart attack.  Hmm.  And generally, 50% of those recover.  So, we're going to keep you here naturally, and you're going to do your tests, and we're  going to give you this IPA, a special injection that will stop the pain.  And I was in the hospital with a heart attack, and I subsequently went home, and... 
[01:47:30]  After how much time did you go home?  About a week.  I stopped smoking that day.  I threw cigarettes.  I had cigarettes in my pocket.  I threw them in the Potomac.  And then, six months later, I go in for a stress test, and the doctor made me step off  the machine in one minute, and said, there's something really wrong.  Wow.  They did a test, and he said, you're going to need bypass surgery.  Bypass surgery.  So, I'm scared of that, and actually, I said, I want a second opinion, so we called a friend 
[01:48:00]  in New York, and the doctor there said, you need it.  So, I decided to do it in New York, because I wanted to die in New York.  Wow.  I was born and raised, I was very pessimistic.  Oh, wow.  I was born and raised in New York.  I was having the pain.  I stopped smoking, but I was still having this.  It was bitchy, man.  It was terrible.  So, I go to New York, and so now it turns funny.  It's funny now, by the way.  It wasn't funny.  Right at the time, no.  It's a rainy November morning, end of November, rainy morning, 1987, November 30th. 
[01:48:30]  My brother takes me.  We get to New York Hospital, walk in, and standing right there is Governor Mario Cuomo and the  president of New York Hospital.  And he said, Mr. King, you don't have to fill out the forms.  We'll take you right up to the 15th floor.  We have a special room for you, and your surgery is tomorrow.  So, I was scared that I go up in this room.  They show me this room.  What a room.  Inlaid carpeting, a view of the East River.  It's raining.  I'm looking down the East River. 
[01:49:00]  Beautiful television sets, you know, chest of drawers.  The only thing that told you that it was a hospital room was a hospital bed.  Other than that, everything was like a suite.  And the president of New York Hospital says to me, Mr. King, I'll have you know that the  Shah of Iran stayed in this room.  And I said, as I recollect, he died.  How about you put me in a ward with 48 people, all of whom go home. 
[01:49:30]  So, it was, you know, now I have not met this.  It's funnier.  It's not funny in the telling.  Not funny at the time.  I understand.  Now, I have not met my surgeon.  Hmm.  He comes in the door.  It's raining Sunday.  My agent is sitting in Bob Wolf, the late Bob Wolf, my brother.  Comes in, he's got a 10-gallon hat, big cowboy boots.  Dr. Wayne Isom, he wound up doing Letterman and a lot of famous movies. 
[01:50:00]  Walter Cronkite, he's a wonderful man.  Became friends.  But at that time, I didn't know him.  And he goes, Mr. King, you're going to do right fine.  Right fine.  I looked at the films.  It should be a breeze.  You're going to do right fine.  I discovered that way, but all heart surgeons are either from Texas or Jewish.  There's no South Dakota Republican heart surgeon.  And he comes over to me, and he starts to do the thing that they all do. 
[01:50:30]  They take the two fingers.  Start tapping.  They tap the chest, which I discover is the first thing they learn in medical school.  Tapping.  And as I look down, I swear to God, he has no right thumb.  Whoa, whoa.  And he's doing surgery?  Oh, wow.  Doing my surgery.  He's got no right thumb.  It turned out there was a shearing accident.  His mother was doing leaves and cut and made them ambidextrous.  This is how I decided to lay it.  But now, I'm looking down, I'm scared to death.  He's telling me what they're going to do. 
[01:51:00]  They're going to cut out my chest with a saw, pull it apart, move my heart, put my heart on a lung machine.  I'm listening to all this, and he's got, so here's what I said, and this humor can come from anywhere.  I said, doctor, I have had this strange habit all my life.  When I meet people, for some reason, I count their fingers.  With you, I get to nine.  So he explained to me the shearing axe and everything, and I swear to God, I go to sleep that night, and I dream that he's shaving, and he cut his other thumb. 
[01:51:30]  Now he's got eight fingers.  And he says to the nurse, how many are we doing today?  She says, five.  Who's first?  King.  And he says, oh, we'll try, King.  And then I said, but it came through, and I had all my pellets in me they put inside.  And that was 1987, and this is 2013, so.  26 years, right? 
[01:52:00]  26 years.  And I needed a stent 10 years later, a pre-stent.  But you eat probably pretty healthy.  I try to eat healthy.  See, I don't exercise as much as I used to.  I walk a lot.  I'm 79.  I don't feel 79.  I'm doing stuff.  I'm on the Internet.  I'm doing a Hulu show.  Yeah.  I can't believe I'm doing all that.  I'm doing speeches everywhere.  I do a comedy tour.  Because I couldn't retire.  Yeah, but you look a lot younger than 79.  You know what I take that helps me keep young? 
[01:52:30]  It's band and baseball.  HGH.  Oh, really?  Human growth hormone.  Is that good?  I take it in pill form.  Players have taken it injection.  It's supposed to keep you younger and you're quick recovery from injury.  I've been taking it for 16 years.  Gee.  It's not banned in life.  It's banned in baseball.  Right.  What are the downsides to it, though?  I have had no reaction to it.  So I don't know what it does, except people tell me I don't look my age.  I take a lot of vitamins.  Barry stands up.  He's got a tail.  I take medication. 
[01:53:00]  You take HGH.  How do you get that?  You buy it from a...  You can get it in a...  GNC.  GNC.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm going to start taking that.  I will, too.  Man, right?  If that isn't an endorsement.  Oh, my God.  Just walking around.  He used to...  What was the big one?  Larry, what about Garlick?  Garlick it was.  That's right.  Garlick as in unique as in Garlick.  That was a big sponsorship.  That was the spot.  Are they still around?  Boy, we did good business.  We used to make...  You became synonymous with Garlick. 
[01:53:30]  And we might have made fun of it, Larry, over the years.  Well, everybody might have made fun of it a few times.  I also did Welch's, Grape Feast.  Welch's!  Welch's, Grape Feast, Florida, Orange Juice.  Wow, yeah.  Garlick.  Unique as in Garlick.  And now I'm doing a vitamin commercial now for fish oil.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a big one.  That is good.  Yeah, I do that.  That's the best supplement.  Only supplement that the FDA approves.  I have it.  I don't take it. 
[01:54:00]  Why?  I don't know.  He's not going to eat his relatives.  Oh, jeez.  He's implying that I'm fish looking.  That's why he's in the corner.  He's just mean-spirited.  That's just terrible.  There's Opie and Anthony and...  That guy.  That's Rich Vaughn.  Exactly.  I'm a comedian.  He's the world's tallest dwarf.  He just stops in?  Yeah, he just stops in.  Yeah, he just stops in.  He's a local comic.  It's the first time he's on our show.  No, a national comic.  First time on our show.  We don't know much about him.  What is Surrender Darcy?  He said he could sit in for the interview.  It's from The Wizard of Oz. 
[01:54:30]  Yes.  It's a shirt.  My kid bought it.  And you?  Well, that's a little hurtful, Larry.  I'm here every time you come in.  No, but here's the problem.  You do look like a fish.  Oh, what?  No, no, no.  I mean that as a cover.  And I'm taking this one.  And they never identify you.  They never introduce you.  That is terrible.  I know.  I'm Jim Norton.  That's Jim Norton.  Hi, Larry.  And what are you to the Opie and Anthony show?  I am the anchor.  The Albatross.  The thing that stops you from going to Superstar. 
[01:55:00]  No, I'm just kind of the third guy in the room.  And it's just a little something I've been doing for 11 years.  By the way, a couple of questions.  Yes, sir.  Oh, no.  Are you paid?  Yes.  Now, the next question.  Is it what they're paid?  No.  Is this a radio show?  I guess.  We hope.  Some would say.  Why is there a beautiful lady at the camera?  That's Sam.  Oh.  They film it and maybe they'll throw like five minutes up on the website. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, they put it on the website.  You know, a little highlight.  A little highlight.  So I understand that.  Now, explain the guy in the corner.  That's a...  Exactly.  Yeah, we've been trying to figure that out for a while.  We've been trying.  Buana of the jungle.  Buana.  What is he?  He says he doesn't have any black in him.  An ass.  Which confuses us.  He's got kind of black features.  Uh, well, usually I sit over there.  When there's a guest in, I video them.  Oh, but when you don't...  When there's no...  When you don't... 
[01:56:00]  When you sit over there, what do you do?  Nothing.  Nothing.  Yeah.  He's supposed to be our web guy, so...  And kind of a very immediate producer.  How big is this production?  One, two, three...  Oh, it's crazy.  Is it six every day?  Yeah.  There's people in the other room.  That's one person.  Yeah.  It looks like people.  The worst is yet to come.

The worst of the week countdown continues to count down the great moments that happened this week on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:00:30]  I am Sam Roberts from O&A and from after Opie and Anthony Live.  A lot to get to still.  And I know, we're deep into the countdown now.  You should be thinking to yourself, we've already heard so much great stuff, there can't be much left.  Oh, there is.  More from Lady Diane Marion.  I said it right that time.  Larry King.  We just played him.  So Nick Walenda is who we'll get to now.  Nick Walenda, he walked across the Grand Canyon. 
[02:01:00]  This guy's incredible.  They stretched a tightrope that was four football fields long across the Grand Canyon.  And he did it.  And he prayed to Lord Baby's Sweet Jesus the entire time.  Does he have the balls to come on the Opie and Anthony Show?  Yes, of course he does.  He walked across the goddamn Grand Canyon.  Here's how he sounded.  I gotta tell you, amazing to watch that.  You can't even fathom being in that position. 
[02:01:30]  I can't.  You just can't.  You're walking across the Grand Canyon on a wire.  And it's one thing to see it on television and try to put yourself in that position.  What, what, I can't even say what were you thinking, what, what's the best way you can  explain what that is like, being in the middle of that?  I'll explain it the way my great-grandfather did.  Life is on the wire.  Everything else is just waiting.  Yeah.  And, you know, that's something that I've done since I was two years old. 
[02:02:00]  So for me, it's life.  It's what I do.  For you, you don't understand it.  Not at all.  For me, I don't understand you sitting in the studio here on the radio.  Neither do our listeners.  So when you step out there, you have complete faith in yourself and in your training.  Yeah.  In the fact that I've prepared properly.  Sure.  You know, I have a training camp in Sarasota, Florida, my hometown, where I train with wind  speeds of 91 miles per hour leading up to this. 
[02:02:30]  I've actually trained last year at 120-mile-an-hour winds.  Oh, my God.  For this event, we also created gusts 45 to 55 miles per hour, which is great because I  experienced, Cantore told me, 48-mile-an-hour winds while I was down on the wire.  We had two gusts near that.  Yeah.  Or one that was at 48.  Yeah, we saw your clothing really rippling in the wind like that.  Everybody, the biggest question about that walk was, what type of jeans are you wearing?  Yes.  People did notice the kind of flared bottom.  They were worrisome. 
[02:03:00]  I felt like you were going to, like, catch your heel on your jeans.  You know what?  It's funny.  I'm like, why wouldn't you wear flood pants?  I wear buffalo jeans, and I just love them.  They're extremely comfortable, and it really is all about people being able to relate to  me.  I don't wear rhinestones and sequins and tights or whatever.  I want people to go, hey, that guy's a normal guy that just has a very unique occupation.  I got a beautiful wife, three beautiful kids, and I just do something that you guys can't  relate to.  And that's why 13 million people here in the U.S. alone tuned in to watch. 
[02:03:30]  With that said, some have said it's a little selfish to walk the wire with the kids and  the wife on the other side freaking out.  Well, a couple things to that.  For one, my wife and kids, my wife comes from eight generations of circus on one side, seven  on the other.  There you go.  She performs on the wire right alongside of me, so she's just as darn selfish as me.  Okay.  And my three kids were raised around it.  It's all they know.  It's what their dad does.  So I'm sure there's a little bit of stress, but it's nowhere near the stress level if you  were to go on the wire and your kids were to watch tomorrow. 
[02:04:00]  Right, right.  This is just what their dad does.  I'll give you an example.  I walked across the Allegheny River in Pittsburgh about three years ago, and I was about 250  feet up.  It was 1,400 feet across.  It started raining while I was walking.  As I was walking, there was a bridge to my right, and I look over, and my family's walking  alongside, and both my boys are down playing their Nintendos.  And I was told during this event, my kids were texting most of the time.  I think that speaks volumes to how comfortable they are.  I have one more question that I just need to know. 
[02:04:30]  Like, what's your plan if all of a sudden you realize, oh, boy, I'm going to fall?  That's a great question.  What's the move you do?  Because obviously you've figured that out as well.  Absolutely.  The wire is always at my feet.  Whether I'm 1,500 feet over the Grand Canyon or 1,500 feet over the streets of New York  City, that wire is always right at my feet.  There's a misconception that because I'm higher, it's more dangerous.  But the truth is, I've trained my entire life, since I was two years old, that if I ever  get off that cable, even step off to get a drink of water, I grab that cable. 
[02:05:00]  Now, gravity pulls you down.  We all know that.  We also do plenty of studies, four years of meteorological studies, that show that the  winds aren't strong enough there to pick me up and throw me off that wire.  It would take more than hurricane-force winds.  We knew that there was going to be nothing maximum of 60 miles per hour.  So, therefore, I would have fallen down.  And if there were any gusts, if it were to get too gusty, I would have went down to that  wire.  I would have dropped down.  I probably would have had no more kids, but I have three, and I'm happy with that anyways.  I would have dropped down and bear-hugged that wire. 
[02:05:30]  I trained to hold onto that wire between 20 and 30 minutes.  My rescue teams, who are standing by on each side, have baskets that are mounted to that  wire, as well as a helicopter standing by, all trained to be at me within 60 seconds,  no matter where I am on that wire.  So, there are backup plans.  There's contingency plans.  And it's a lot safer than maybe you can understand.  But the truth is, that wire's at my feet.  Now, the next question is, well, your great-grandfather was 73, or sorry, in 1978, was walking between  two buildings in Puerto Rico, he fell and lost his life.  Well, if you watch that video, which I've watched hundreds of times, he goes down to 
[02:06:00]  that wire, which is our safe haven.  He was 73.  He had a double hernia and an injured collarbone and had no business being on the wire.  Now, that's with the deepest of respect, because he's my hero, but he didn't have the strength  to hold on.  And if you don't have the strength to hold on anymore, your lines might think you're  fine walking, but you shouldn't be on the wire anymore.  Is that what it was?  He just couldn't hold it, and that's why?  He couldn't hold it.  That's correct.  It did also look like the pole.  Well, the pole helped him go down a bit, too.  It absolutely did. 
[02:06:30]  See, he went to sit on the wire.  I sat, actually, in Sarasota during my training camp.  We had 30,000 people from my hometown show up during training.  Wow.  And I would sit on the wire 20 feet up.  I'd sit there for half an hour doing question and answer with the public.  No kidding.  We're extremely comfortable in those conditions, and I think it was evident even that night  on TV on Sunday.  And how do you ditch the pole if you're falling?  The pole actually would just get tossed out of the way.  It would.  Yeah, and again, it's stuff that we train for.  I mean, we train to drop to that wire and grab on and hold on.  That's why this is just incredibly fascinating to us. 
[02:07:00]  And then I have to say this.  When you did the Niagara Falls walk, we were all so mad.  Yeah.  Because I know it was your TV partner, and you were like...  So was I, yeah.  Yeah, and you were a good sport about it, but it was obvious.  In the end, I think that was a huge gift because it made this event so much bigger.  Sure.  It really did.  Because then they were able to say, and here he's doing it without any protection.  No, seven times higher.  Yes.  Much stronger winds.  Double, more than double the amount of winds.  Wouldn't your move be to go back to Niagara Falls now without the safety wire? 
[02:07:30]  We'll see.  I don't know.  I would think about it.  I think it's almost stepping backwards, though, to do that, to be honest.  Yes, I've got my sights set on other things.  And New York has always said no to the skyscraper.  I haven't even knocked on any doors yet.  So yes, if I was the chief of police, and a camera was thrown in my face, and somebody  said, would you let Nick Willen do this?  He said what he's trained to do, and I respect him deeply.  But we go through the proper channels.  And actually, I'd start with the governor's office, and you have a great relation with  him.  I had to change a law over 100 years old just to walk over Niagara. 
[02:08:00]  And if I can change a law, I think I can make things happen with the assistance of others.  Were you ever scared over the Grand Canyon?  I wasn't ever scared.  No, there was never a point where I thought, I'm going to fall, or I'm going to have to  go grab this wire.  There were two points where you saw me kneel down, and that was because I started to  build a rhythm in that cable.  There's no stabilization and no shock absorbers in that cable.  Those pendulums you saw are simply to keep that wire from twisting out from under my feet.  They don't take any of that rhythm out.  Because what will happen is if I keep the same pace and the same size steps, I'll build 
[02:08:30]  a huge rhythm in that cable, a frequency that will keep getting bigger.  And what happens is it bounces to one side, it comes right back at me.  So I had to stop.  Exactly.  I had to stop, let that fade out a bit, and then get up and keep walking.  What do you look at when you're walking?  What is your focal point?  It just depends.  As I walk over the edge, that's the biggest rush.  I can only imagine the falls or anything.  Oh, absolutely.  Look down and enjoy that.  Oh, my God.  We can't even understand that.  And then there were three points on that wire where I was able to look down and actually  enjoy the view.  I had to be very focused. 
[02:09:00]  We had an issue with the tension of the cable.  The engineers had expected the weather, and the meteorologist told us the weather, it was  going to be about 97 degrees that night.  It was only about 86 degrees.  And the cable gets more taut, more tension, when it's hot outside.  So as it cools off, that cable starts to release tension.  We were supposed to be at 67,000 pounds, and we were only at 62.  So that wire moved a lot more than it was supposed to.  It seemed to have some slack in the middle.  They showed one point where the camera was looking right down the cable, and you could  see the sag in it. 
[02:09:30]  You're walking uphill when you're halfway through.  Well, yeah.  And actually, it's much more comfortable to walk uphill than downhill.  Oh, wow.  I started on a plateau that was about 40 feet higher than where I finished.  So three quarters of the walk was downhill, which is much more uncomfortable.  Was there ever a moment on a wire anywhere where you had a moment of, I can't do this  or this?  Like, I always thought my nightmare is to wake up where you are and then look down and  go, oh, I can't do this.  Have you ever had a moment where you're like, I'm...  There was never a moment.  There was a couple moments where I was like, you know, it kind of took me back. 
[02:10:00]  And I always relate to, or I always talk about the walk, the first world record I did, which  was in Newark, New Jersey at the Prudential Center.  When it first opened, I did a world record where I rode a bicycle on the wire live on  the Today Show for a world record of 135 feet high, 235 feet long.  And it had that same drop.  It's called the catenary in engineering terms, but it's basically a smiley face.  And of course, riding downhill was easy.  But when I got to the three-quarter mark, I was riding uphill and that back wheel started 
[02:10:30]  spinning, it was kind of like a, you know, took me back.  And you go back to training and I've trained to get off of that bike.  I can pick that bike up and walk in and all of that stuff comes into play.  Your mind kind of works a million miles a second.  But again, it's so much about training and preparation.  What I do is such a calculated risk.  People don't understand that because you don't walk a wire.  But we can train for pretty much everything, you know, including, you know, 92, 120 mile  an hour winds.  That's, you know, you can prepare for everything.  That's what makes it amazing for the spectator because we don't think about all the training 
[02:11:00]  that is involved.  We just see a guy on a wire and go, ah, what's he doing?  You know, I say it all the time.  If there was one police officer or three police officers in the world and 100,000 wire walkers,  then everybody'd be, wow, look at the police officer.  That's unreal.  I think what he does is way more dangerous than me.  We'd still be looking at the wire walker.  The pre-show was almost more amazing than the Grand Canyon walk when you went back to where  your grandfather, you know, fell and you redid it and then your mom decided to do it. 
[02:11:30]  And then she has to sit down on the wire and then you have to walk over her.  It was unbelievable.  And then watching her get back up.  It was amazing.  The strength involved.  When I was training in Sarasota with this cable, my mom had to.  I mean, she was begging me, please let me get on this cable.  Let me walk it with you.  So she got on that cable and walked with me in training.  And if I let her, she would have walked across the Grand Canyon, no question.  And she could do it, no problem you think?  I think she could do it.  I wouldn't allow her to because I'd be worried about her.  And she would take away a little, you know.  Well, yeah.  I mean, come on. 
[02:12:00]  Let's be honest.  And his 60-year-old mother did it, too.  Exactly.  What do you think of the production technology?  Because if you look back at the earlier, you know, Walenda family, obviously just huge.  Seven generations.  Seven generations.  And the camera work in the old days, the way that looked over Niagara Falls and the Grand Canyon, spectacular.  The Discovery Channel did an unbelievable job.  We had, I think, 16 cameras, including two on me, POV cameras. 
[02:12:30]  And, you know, it was unbelievable.  I'm excited because we're working on a director's cut right now where I'll talk through that entire walk.  And that, the helicopter shot, where it wraps around you and the background is flying past you, your center frame,  and then it takes off and now goes away and puts you in the distance.  It was, you got goosebumps.  It looked amazing.  It was dizzying.  I haven't even watched the entire thing yet.  Really?  Because I'm waiting to do that film of the director's cut because I want to watch it for the first time. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, you want to be fresh, yeah.  But I've seen, you know, as I'm doing the media tour, I've seen some footage and it is, it gives me goosebumps.  It looks amazing.  It makes me nervous and I was the one on the wire.  And the other amazing shot was from the floor, from the bottom of the canyon, up, and they zoomed in on you.  I haven't seen that one.  They pull back slowly and you're like, when is this going to stop?  Because you are literally a dot up there.  The only thing that they didn't do that I really wish they did was put, I wanted to put a car down in the bottom of the canyon  because I wanted people to have something to relate to.  Scale, right.  It's so hard when you're there. 
[02:13:30]  There's no perspective.  You can't, you just can't understand.  You can't contemplate.  You're not sure how big those rocks are down there.  Because there's nothing to relate it to.  I would be impressed even if you wore a parachute while you did that.  I would still be blown away by that.  You said you were having a problem with an optical illusion.  Very much so.  You know, those jagged edges of the canyon.  I'm looking at a wire that's moving.  I'm looking at these pendulums that are moving opposite of that.  And those canyon walls.  I mean, it was messing with me like you wouldn't believe.  Were you getting the feeling?  Trying to figure out, okay, where's the wire and where am I?  Because normally there's something that I can focus on. 
[02:14:00]  And when you saw, when I got three quarters of the way across, I can guarantee you my face changed.  Because now I could focus on the end point above those walls and all was well.  Because now I have something solid to focus on.  But those walls give that illusion with that wire moving like they're moving as well.  And you need something for your equilibrium.  You just gave me anxiety just driving that.  I saw it in your face too, Jimmy.  Yeah, it's horrifying.  We have this, we kind of like Philippe Petit a lot because we had the train center walk.  Sure. 
[02:14:30]  And there's nothing about what you do that makes sense to me.  It's so terrifying.  And that's why people are so in awe of it.  It's like we can't, the balls, the courage to do that.  I mean, you obviously have a lot of faith.  Oh, absolutely.  I think that's important.  Well, it's important in my life.  You set a world record, saying Jesus the most.  Yeah, I think so.  Actually, Jesus was trending on Twitter that day.  Is that used for yourself also?  Obviously, it's your faith and it helps you.  Is it kind of a mantra, though? 
[02:15:00]  I was just raised that way and that's where I find peace.  And who else is going to listen to me while I'm up there by God?  I'm right up there with him.  How freaked that would you be if you just heard him go, Nick, I heard you.  Well, there are so many photos on the Internet right now of like, you know, there's one of  Jesus under me holding me and saying, shh, stop saying that.  You know, there's so many.  It's hilarious.  Before you reach the other side, you were an Internet meme.  Definitely.  You were on there.  1.3 million tweets within that two-hour special. 
[02:15:30]  People in this day and age just love being involved in something like that.  It becomes this huge community of people as close as you could be in the same room watching.  It is amazing.  You know, modern technology, social media, and the fact that I can, you know, I talk to  my fans all the time and I think that's so awesome that I'm able to.  And it's so inspiring to me.  You should have tweeted as you were walking.  I was just thinking that, dude.  How great would that have been?  Oh, man.  How great would that have been?  I had my phone in my pocket.  I wanted to tweet from the wire.  I wanted to tweet a photo from there. 
[02:16:00]  Wow.  It was just the wire was moving way too much in the way.  But you were thinking about it.  Oh, absolutely.  Oh, that would have been.  Absolutely.  There has to be a way to do it.  I'll do it for one of my next walks, guarantee.  A button on the onion.  There has to be a way to do it where you can have a button.  Well, when I broke that world record in 2008 on the Today Show, I was 135 feet up.  I sat down in the middle of the wire, got my phone out, and called Matt Lauer on my cell phone.  Wow.  So I can tweet from up there for sure, and I can almost guarantee you my next walk, I'll be tweeting from the wire.  You'll be tweeting from the wire.  Here's the problem, as we see it.  You're running out of walks because, I mean, where do you go after the Grand Canyon?  Oh, man, there's so many around the world. 
[02:16:30]  I'm on top of the Eiffel Tower, the Great Wall of China, the pyramids in Egypt.  There are just many that I want to do.  I want to do the Opera House in Australia to the Harbor Bridge.  It really doesn't have to be the highest or the wide.  It's like just the backdrop.  It's really the backdrop.  That's what it's about.  That's my partner on TV, and that's what it, you know, it's about that amazing backdrop and showcasing.  Yeah.  Would you do the, because, of course, the Trade Center's not here anymore, but what are the towers, the Petrosian?  Petronas Towers, absolutely, yeah, in Malaysia. 
[02:17:00]  What is your, because we're obsessed with, what's his name, Alain Robert or Alain Robert, the guy who climbs the buildings?  Yes, yep.  But you, to me, are the only guy that trumps him.  What you do is, I think, scarier.  Yeah, Petronas Towers are definitely on the list.  How high are they now?  I don't know.  1,100 feet, maybe?  Any taller?  No, they're higher than that, I believe.  Yeah.  So what's your number one?  Would they be your number one, or what's the place that you're like, I want your dream walk?  It's so hard, because there's so many, to be honest.  I mean, there really are so many.  I really want to do something big here in the city. 
[02:17:30]  I really do.  That would be amazing to watch, yeah.  Oh, my God.  How far is the Empire?  Sorry.  How far is the Empire to the...  No, that's okay.  Give me a chance to think.  It's about 4,000 feet from what I know we're working on.  Actually, I have my engineers looking at it this week.  They've been out in the canyon, of course.  4,000 feet?  About 4,000 feet.  Oh, yeah.  That's what I want to say.  Obviously, you're online and tweeting and whatnot.  We've read from some people that are just ridiculous, like, the wire's as wide as his foot. 
[02:18:00]  Do you read some of those, and you're like, really?  What do I have to do here?  Of course.  There's always people who are going to say that sort of thing.  To be honest.  What is it going to take to not have haters?  I know.  The greatest guy in the country.  To be honest with you guys, it is extremely uncomfortable to walk on that cable, because  I've trained my entire life to walk on a 5-8-inch wire rope the size of a nickel.  My whole life.  So it's like changing it all over again, you know?  I've trained for one thing, and I don't physically have a groove in my foot, but I really do.  I know where that wire's supposed to set. 
[02:18:30]  On a 2-inch wire rope, you don't have that.  So if you step to the side, it starts to twist.  That cable starts to do this under you, and it's very easy to do that.  So if anything, if it was my desire, it would have been a 5-8-inch wire rope.  It wouldn't have been a 2-inch rope.  Why did they make it bigger?  Because of engineering, we had to.  There was no way to stabilize that cable.  If you watch, like even Philippe Petit's walk that he did here in the trade centers, he had ropes coming off the sides that would stabilize that wire.  We couldn't do that.  No one in the history of wire walking had ever rigged a cable until Niagara Falls like what I rigged. 
[02:19:00]  And it moves a lot.  It's got a life of its own, as I told you about those rhythms.  Those ropes that we put on normally, they help stabilize and take all those rhythms out.  So it took a lot of special, specific training for this walk.  The anchoring process was amazing to watch, too.  Drilling those deep, deep holes, putting it in, cementing them in.  Because you just look, and you're figuring, now, that's a lot of weight, that cable, across quite a span.  How is that fastened?  We had to tension that cable to, I think I said earlier, but about 67,000 pounds. 
[02:19:30]  67,000 pounds.  And everything we do is redundant.  And we work in a five-to-one safety ratio, which means if that cable can support five pounds, we'll never put more than one pound on it.  And if those anchors can support five pounds, we'll never load them more than one pound.  So everything has to be five times over what we're doing.  That's why there were four cables, and the engineers do all of that stuff.  But that's why I had to use that big cable.  Going back to that was because the weight of it itself, it's about eight and a half pounds a foot.  That helps stabilize the cable. 
[02:20:00]  If I used a five-eighths, it would have snapped under that load for one.  And number two, it would have been everywhere.  All over the place.  Did you clean up after yourself there, Nick?  Because they were very concerned over there at the Grand Canyon.  Absolutely.  Actually, they requested that we leave.  They wanted me to even leave the cable up.  They didn't want anything to move because it's an amazing attraction for them.  Now, they requested that the day after the cable came down because they weren't out there.  They were in their offices in Navajo.  Oh, man.  Whoops.  Did you put that back?  They did ask.  We are leaving all the anchors and the startup and finish platform.  They've asked to leave all that stuff. 
[02:20:30]  And they're doing, I guess this will be a look-out point where people can actually go out there  and see where I started and finished.  If you left that, believe me, you don't want to leave that cable.  Someone would have tried.  Somebody would get out.  Some drunk.  Well, that's exactly right.  It would have to be secured very well.  Oh, I bet.  What part of the canyon was it?  I know the South Rim.  I've been to the South Rim.  From the basic park.  It was on Navajo Territory and about eight miles outside of the national parks.  So in order to get permission from national parks is like changing a law, which is what  I had to do in Niagara Falls. 
[02:21:00]  It's more than that.  It's like an act of God, really.  But that's what we did on Navajo land.  It was really good for them.  It really promoted their land.  And we paid them a good sum of money to be there as well.  And, you know, it was a great experience.  The worst of the week.  Countdown.  And we called the Anthony Channel.  Sirius XM.

Now, here's an important message from the New York City Mayor's Office.  MOPD works to assure that people with disabilities can enjoy the rich opportunities our city has 
[02:24:30]  to offer.  This includes the freedom to travel throughout New York City, a right most of us take for  granted.  For people with disabilities, traveling around the city can become a challenge when drivers  fail to follow basic parking rules.  New York City's parking regulations protect the rights of people with disabilities.  When you violate parking regulations, you not only violate the law, you violate the rights  of others.  Parking spaces designated for people with disabilities ensure equal access to goods and services.  Parking without a permit in a designated space or using a fake permit is illegal. 
[02:25:00]  Anyone who parks illegally in a space designated for a person with disability will be ticketed  and subject to being towed.  The fine for this violation is $180.  So let's all respect the city's parking laws and the right of every New Yorker to accessible  transportation.  For more information, dial 311.  Guess what limits Kristen's golf game?

It's Sam Roberts from Opie and Anthony and After Opie and Anthony Live bringing to you 
[02:26:00]  the Worst of the Week Countdown.  It's what we do every weekend here on the Opie and Anthony channel.  Countdown all the great moments that happened on the Opie and Anthony show this week.  And if you've been listening from the beginning, you heard a little bit of Lady Diane Marion  already.  Lady Diane Marion, they were staples of the Opie and Anthony show for a long time, dating  back from before SiriusXM even existed, when Opie and Anthony were doing afternoons in New  York.  Well, after being gone for like five or six years from the show, they finally made their 
[02:26:30]  return.  This, ladies and gentlemen, and by the way, if you're driving right now, maybe you want  to change the channel, because you're going to want to drive off a bridge when you hear  these two.  I give them 30 seconds before you can't stand them anymore.  It's Lady Di and Marion being reintroduced to the Opie and Anthony audience.  Number two.  Number two.  I've forgotten that when you talk to Marion about something, Lady Di will chime in about  whatever it is with her.  She'll make it about herself like, oh, my hair. 
[02:27:00]  Right.  We didn't ask you about your hair, Lady Di.  We just got a cut the other day.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Colin Quinn hangs with legit celebrities.  We'd rather be here.  Now I don't know what to say.  Hold on.  There was a question.  You were going to talk about getting a cut, right?  It's like unbelievable.  Hold on.  Hold on.  There was a question.  Marion.  What?  Oh, okay.  So you keep up on the news, you said, Lady Di. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, I do.  All right.  So what's going on in the news?  Yeah, give us a little recap.  Yeah, because we haven't really done any news yet.  No, no news breaks.  We talked to Patty and stuff.  There was a lot happening in the news.  Right.  Why don't you give us a little synopsis of what's going on in the news this week?  Well, James Gandolfini just passed away.  It's Gandolfini.  Diana, it's Gandolfini.  I am going to tell you something.  I was a big soprano fan. 
[02:28:00]  Why wouldn't you?  Very big soprano fan.  I even went on a soprano tour three times.  Yeah, she's a big fan.  I am.  I wasn't really speechless.  And I still am a soprano fan.  Wow.  All right.  Now that's going to change that, even his death.  No, it's not.  That's very loyal.  Most people are going to turn on me.  I still like the repeat.  Sometimes.  I agree.  But James Gandolfini.  James Gandolfini. 
[02:28:30]  It's Feeney, Diane.  F-I-N-I.  Like Shirley Feeney.  Right.  Get it?  No, that's Shirley Feeney.  It's right.  You know, but everything else on the news right now is, you know, not really.  What else?  Somebody shooting somebody.  Not that important.  Not that important.  It's been one of the craziest news weeks in a long time.  The scandal feel he dies.  Paula Deen got canned.  The Zimmerman thing has ramped up.  You got Aaron Hernandez.  Paula Deen got canned.  All right.  Paula Deen.  What about that? 
[02:29:00]  Paula Deen got fired.  Why?  For, like, she said to, she was a racist.  She said something.  How was she a racist?  Hold on.  Lady Di, what'd she say?  Yes.  We're on satellite.  What'd she say?  No, no, no.  It doesn't matter.  What'd she say?  I don't want to say it.  Say what?  No, she just said something.  What'd she say?  What'd she say?  I don't even know.  What'd she say?  No, no, no.  Nothing.  She said something that sometimes you've got to watch what you say on TV.  What?  What'd she say, Marion?  I'm not really sure, but I know it had something to do with racial.  What'd she say?  What'd she say? 
[02:29:30]  Is there a word or something?  What'd she say?  The N-word.  Whoa!  Wow.  Slow down, Lady Di.  What the fuck is that?  It's controversial.  What the fuck is that?  I knew this day would be controversial, but I didn't think it would go here.  You know when you say the N-word, you're actually saying the word.  What the fuck?  Right.  Well, there you go.  I said it.  But there's a lot of news.  There you go.  It's on all over the news, but you know what?  Now she ruined her reputation.  Uh-huh.  And her...  Hey, you know what? 
[02:30:00]  Hey.  You gotta watch what you say.  You do.  You do.  Right.  All right, what about the Trayvon Martin, Zimmerman, George Zimmerman murder trial?  I am following that, because I have not been watching the news.  I've been busy.  You're busy.  You've been on cruises.  Yeah, she's...  I know.  Cruise.  Where did she go, though?  That's a great question.  Caribbean.  I've been watching that.  The guy's still on trial.  St. Martin, St. Thomas, Puerto Rico.  He's still...  He's on trial.  Oh, he's still on trial?  Oh, good.  Okay, good.  I didn't know that.  And what's the...  What's going on in that trial?  You know what?  I really don't know. 
[02:30:30]  You know, the jury has to decide what they're going to do with him.  What's the basic gist of what happened?  If he's going to go to jail.  What happened?  But what happened in the last couple days with the trial?  Like, what happened with the whole thing?  What's the background story here?  He claimed that he shot him in self-defense.  Okay.  All right?  And his family claims that, you know, that the guy just shot him for who knows what.  So that's all I have to say about that.  I mean, you know...  I don't know who that is, but they wave to me.  Oh, of course. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, you're a big star.  People know you guys around here.  Yep.  It was the first time we've been in the studio.  It's nice.  Very nice.  You know, it's nice.  You think it's nice?  It's not that small.  No?  No, it's a nice studio, but it is.  You know what?  The last time we saw you guys, you guys were down the street on 57th Street.  Really?  Yeah.  Wow, that's a long time ago.  And then NEW, but before that...  Hey, Jim.  Yeah.  I saw you on Channel 12 about a peanut scum.  That sounds awful.  That sounds awful. 
[02:31:30]  Jim, you've done it.  There's nothing you can really say to that.  It was intended to be a cop.  It was intended to be a cop, but it was a slam.  You look really, really good.  It does look good.  Spotlight.  I think the show was called Spotlight.  Spotlight.  On Channel 12.  News 12, Long Island.  Channel 12.  Jimmy's been all over TV lately.  He's from Jersey.  Oh, Jersey.  Yeah, I get rid of you.  That is a brutal...  Don't even remember, he's from Jersey.  That was like a bat to the head.  He really is.  A bat to the head.  You just sat there stunned. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I get him.  When's the next time you're going to be at Caroline's?  Yes.  Probably not until next year.  I just did it.  Really?  Yeah.  Is that the only club you go to?  No, no.  A lot of these are during a week.  I like to know them on the weekends.  He works the comedy cellar all the time down on McDougal Street.  I don't know where that is.  I know it's down in the village.  I'll give you direction.  It's down in the village.  You get off at West Forster and any train.  It would be nice to have them down there.  Saturdays?  Friday or Saturdays?  Saturdays at Friday.  No.  Yes.  A lot of Fridays. 
[02:32:30]  Not this weekend, but he's around.  Yeah.  I'll have to come catch your show on a Friday.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Saturday night is always there.  Early show.  And then wait for him.  He goes up afterwards.  Make sure he can go upstairs.  Because I was just here in the city the other day at Street Fair.  Right over there.  Yeah, maybe he's right near there.  I come over here a lot.  Every couple of Saturdays or Sundays.  And then my husband come over here and walk around.  Oh, yeah?  Do you guys see that?  You guys are going all over the place.  Maybe the two of you could come to the show.  Yeah.  You and Lady Di as well.  Lady Di, you've got to get out.  Thank you.  Because you've got to get out, Lady Di.  It seems like you're sequestering yourself in that house. 
[02:33:00]  Right.  You're watching television.  You're not getting out.  First of all, we've got to talk about this job situation.  I do go out.  Everyone in this room has talked about the job situation and saying that people got...  Patty was saying she got a job in no time when she needed to get one.  She's doing great.  She's doing wonderful.  She's mad at you.  Patty is doing great.  She's paying all our bills.  She's mad at Lady Di.  Why?  Because you're not taking care of yourself and not working.  I blame...  I do apply to the job.  I blame his roommate.  His roommate is trouble. 
[02:33:30]  The roommate is...  No, the roommate doesn't.  No, no.  Roommate's an enabler.  No, her roommate retired.  He's an enabler.  And he's doing good.  My husband retired after 41 years of working.  I didn't hear that.  He retired.  Really?  Congratulations.  Yeah, he's doing good.  We're doing both good.  Yeah, good.  We're doing both good.  Yeah, we are.  You guys met him.  Marion, what about Lady Di's roommate?  What's going on there?  Bill's still good.  Why is Lady Di hanging with him?  Why am I hanging with him?  Because Bill's a good person.  He really is.  I've been with him for years.  Honestly.  No, they've been together for a very long time. 
[02:34:00]  Are they boyfriend and girlfriend?  Yes.  No.  In a way, you two are because you live together.  Oh, boy.  You hang together.  We live together.  That don't mean we're...  But, Diane, he takes care of you.  In other words, he's good to you.  Oh, yeah.  Bill's one of the better guys you've ever been with.  And all she has to do is just kind of milk his cum.  No.  No, no, no, no.  No, it ain't like that.  We don't, no.  Honestly, I can tell you something.  Huh?  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  How come she's not letting you talk?  I've got to talk.  All right.  No, no, no.  Listen to me.  He is a good man.  What do you think?  He is a good guy, and I got... 
[02:34:30]  Actually, I was the one that was searching for the apartment, and I got a really nice apartment.  We went through about maybe three places before we got the apartment that we have right now.  Right?  Yeah.  About three places.  I swear to you, he is one of the best guys she's ever been with.  She's got to talk, though.  How come she won't let you talk?  Because you guys are looking at her, and he is one of the best guys she's ever been with.  Let's not say it.  Go ahead.  Say it.  What?  This is like...  He's a very good guy.  We've been together for years and years.  It's on par with the Jeff Probst show. 
[02:35:00]  Wait.  So he's not a good guy?  He is.  He is.  He's a very good guy.  He's one of the best guys.  He's in charge of getting an apartment.  Wait.  Is he a good guy or not?  Yeah.  He's all right.  Oh, he's just all right.  He's not right, Diana.  He's good.  He works.  When you first met him, he was working.  He worked up until he was able to retire.  Right.  Holy shit.  That's better than most guys.  You've been with.  Do you have sex with him?  No.  How often do you get moral sex?  He told us you do.  So don't get a lie.  Occasionally.  Nothing.  Occasionally. 
[02:35:30]  Why?  He told you that.  You blow him.  Yeah.  You don't like sex later, Diana?  He said it.  And then you admitted to it when we were on the phone.  Yeah, because I just wanted to change the subject.  You know.  Oh, really?  What's wrong with him that you don't want to have sex with him?  Hey, he got on the phone with you guys.  Nothing's wrong with him.  He's a big guy.  Because you're not like that you're built like Warren Haynes?  I mean, how come you don't just...  Hey, we sleep in the same bed.  Yeah, we sleep in the same bed, but that don't mean we're doing.  And I want to tell you something.  Bill wants her. 
[02:36:00]  Honestly, because Bill talks to me.  Uh-huh.  Because we're close friends.  Bill wants her to straighten out, too.  Yeah.  You're saying get out.  Now, Jim, sometimes I sleep on the couch.  Yeah.  Why?  Sometimes I sleep.  That's where you're passing out.  That's because I watch TV and sometimes I just...  Pass out.  No.  No, no.  How many times a week do you pass out on the couch?  I don't pass out.  You do.  You drink.  I go to sleep.  I take...  Right.  I take cat naps.  That's it.  Cat naps. 
[02:36:30]  Usually after I eat, which is not a good thing to do.  No.  No.  Right.  You know, so that's why you put on probably 10 pounds, then.  I tell her, the drinks now, you should drink wine with club soda.  That's what I drink when I drink.  Wine with club soda?  Yeah.  Why do you need to put club soda in it?  Oh, it would be red wine with club soda.  Oh, yeah.  That's pretty good.  Listen to me.  Call those spritzers, yeah.  Yeah.  What a spritzer.  Red wine spritzers.  I would.  Spritzers.  Spritzers.  Or cherry rum and diet coke.  She's spritzing the people in the room just saying it.  Or cherry rum and coke. 
[02:37:00]  Diet coke.  Diet, of course.  White wine with spritzers.  But Bill doesn't want anything like that in the house.  Why?  Good.  He don't want wine in the house.  I think he's just, he's got to go straight.  We got Bob Levy checking in.  Hold on a second.  Bob.  I remember him.  I just wanted to know if they look as bad as they sound.  Oh, boy.  Hi.  How are you, Bob?  I heard about you.  I heard about you.  You're a comedian.  I don't think we look that bad. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, my God.  Let me tell you something.  I look pretty good compared to what I did years ago.  Ah.  That's right.  You're about a two or a three now.  Hey, somebody bangs you, really?  Two.  Well, Marian's been married for how many years, Marian?  Eighteen.  Eighteen years.  And Di was prostituting at one point, but now she's not yet.  And Lady Di was blowing hobos at one point.  I never did that.  You were homeless and you were having sex with a gentleman for money.  September will be 18 years.  Okay.  Great.  Thanks.  Eighteen years. 
[02:38:00]  How mad is your husband at his dick?  Excuse me?  Don't talk about my husband, honey.  Let me tell you something.  Don't talk about him.  We've been married for 18 years.  We've been together for about 25.  Yeah.  And he's a good guy.  Let me tell you.  He's a better guy than Bob.  Maybe I'll tell you that much.  And let me tell you, I'm married.  Diane's the one with the roommate.  Yeah.  Ooh.  But Bill and her are boyfriend and girlfriend in a way.  She's fine.  It's a modern relationship.  She's good.  They're good.  They're married.  Yeah.  She's saying that she doesn't have oral sex. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  But you do.  I really don't want to get married again.  It's a modern relationship.  I don't think I got to worry about that.  I don't see a parade of gentlemen on their knee.  After you're actually cheated on you with a train.  I don't blame you.  Jim, Jim, she wasn't married to that guy.  Right.  Okay.  You only had a kid with him.  The guy.  No, Jim, don't.  Jim, don't.  Same shit.  All right.  Don't go there.  Don't talk about that.  What?  The choo-choo?  Yeah, don't.  Why?  Because her son's my godson.  Please, don't talk about that.  But you know what?  You have something to say to Bob Levy? 
[02:39:00]  He made fun of the fact that you're married.  My marriage is good.  I don't know.  Hey, let me tell you one.  I'm married.  What about you?  Are you married?  Yeah, I've been married three times.  Three times?  Well, let me tell you.  There's something wrong with you or something.  To get married three times doesn't got to be wrong.  Face.  You do it once, and if it doesn't work out, you don't bother.  And I'm going to tell you something.  18 years and 25 years with the same guy.  That's right.  I got a good marriage.  Believe me.  I got a very good marriage. 
[02:39:30]  The position here that I saw.  My marriage was not that good.  And O.B. and Anthony met my husband one time, and he talked to my husband a couple times.  Oh, that's true.  Let me explain something about my marriage right now.  Oh, okay.  Go ahead.  Because now we have to talk about her marriage.  Right.  No.  I just wanted to mention, I was married to the guy seven years, and back then I was working.  Ah.  Okay?  He was the one staying home.  Uh-huh.  So the roles are reversed.  And he was the bum.  What did he do?  Well, he just took care of my son.  Worked for the railroad?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  The roles are reversed.  They're on your back, too. 
[02:40:00]  He was taking care of my son when he was a baby, when he was a kid.  Okay?  What?  Yeah.  And he was taking care of my son.  Uh-huh.  And he cooked and he did everything.  I was kind of spoiled.  Yeah.  Like Mr. Mom.  I used to come home to a nice hot dinner and stuff like that.  But he wasn't working.  Uh-huh.  I was the one working seven days a week.  So he was like Mr. Mom.  She was.  But you know what?  The guy turned out to be a real jerk.  Oh, boy.  He did.  He turned out to be a real ass.  Oh, what happened?  He didn't like being with an alcoholic?  As part of my divorce, I had to give a part of my 401k to him. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy.  As part of the divorce.  She's lying.  Now, ironically enough, that's your weight.  He got 40.  I got 60 grand.  Yeah.  Because I was, you know, then I was a let go.  All right.  So I got 60 grand.  And he got 47 grand.  So is Bill just using you for the money?  No.  No, because Bill's got his own thing.  He's got a pension.  He's got social security.  He was hired.  I don't help him with the bills, though.  If that's.  If that's good.  He's got social security.  Believe it. 
[02:41:00]  That's normal.  Because you live together.  I don't help him out with the bills.  How?  With dad's money.  With dad's money, yes.  With dad's money, yes.  Right now.  I'm going to tell you something.  I'm going to tell you something.  Diana.  Yeah.  Let me tell you.  Her father and her mom.  God rest her soul.  Because her mom's gone, too.  Mom's been gone for a long time.  Oh, God rest.  God rest.  Sorry.  Thank you.  They're with my adopted mom and dad, too.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  What happened?  How happened to your mom?  Did you guys go to high school here?  What happened to my mom?  The big casino? 
[02:41:30]  This was around the corner.  She's a great aneurysm.  I know, right?  I didn't know that.  And I'm 49 and she's 51.  And as far as my dad goes, he had one problem after another.  Same age as Gandalf Feeley.  Yeah.  What did you say, Diana?  Everyone's 49.  He was 83 years old.  You just said, let me talk, right?  You don't like being interrupted.  So talk.  I am talking.  I'm trying to.  He was 83 years old.  Well, how do you try to? 
[02:42:00]  What's stopping you from talking?  Come on.  We keep on talking on top of each other.  That's the stopping me.  I'm interrupting you, Diana.  What's up with the eye, lady guy?  You babbling cunt.  Hey, who's this?  That was uncalled for.  That's still Bob Leibon?  That was uncalled for, Bob Leibon.  I'm not a babbling cunt.  You're a babbling dick.  Oh, shit.  There it is.  Fuck.  You're a babbling cunt.  I don't know about your dick, but hey, you know what? 
[02:42:30]  And we don't babble.  We talk.  Yes.  There's a difference between babbling and talking.  Right.  When you're drunk, you babble.  When you're sober, you talk.  That's right.  Right.  Look over there to your right.  That means when I call you, you know I'm drinking.  Yeah.  I know when you're drinking, Diana.  Believe me.  When you call me and I know you're drinking, it's time for me to hang up.  What is she talking about?  What is she saying?  I'm telling you something.  Go ahead, Mary.  I will tell you something.  Go ahead. 
[02:43:00]  When Diane calls me or I call her and I know she's drinking, I'll say, look, Diana, I'll  talk to you later.  Yeah.  Sometimes she says I'll talk to you later.  How can you tell?  And I don't call her for something like that.  I can tell.  She talks about the game shows and all that other stuff.  Yeah.  It's very easy.  What does she babble about that you know that she's been drinking, Mary?  I've known her for years.  I know when she's drinking.  I have to ask you something.  And I will say, I'll call you back in a couple hours.  What is the latest thing I've been babbling about?  The monkeys.  That's right.  Oh, yeah.  Back to the news.  How long were you going? 
[02:43:30]  She wanted to tell you where she's going in two weeks.  I'm going to go see the monkeys next month.  Yeah.  I love, didn't want to, didn't Davy Jones just die?  Last year.  Yes, he did.  Jesus.  About a year ago.  Who goes to see the monkeys without Davy Jones?  I'm going to see Bon Jovi at the end of July.  I saw Davy Jones years ago.  I got two Bon Jovi shows.  And I saw him with the monkeys also.  What was your favorite song?  Cheer up, sleepy Jean.  That was mine.  Oh, that was a good one.  That was my favorite song.  That was a good one. 
[02:44:00]  And that was Davy Jones.  What's your favorite monkey song, Lady Diary?  My favorite one?  Hey, hey, hey, hey, with the monkeys.  Besides the monkeys.  Last Train to Clarksville.  Oh, that was one of your favorite songs.  Was that your, was that the father of your child's favorite song, too?  Well, it was, yes.  It was one of my favorites.  It was one of my favorites, but.  No, I was.  Last Train to Smushville.  I like, I'm a believer.  That's a good song.  I'm a believer.  I'm a believer.  That was another one.  I'm a believer.  You know, who wrote that one was, Neil Diamond wrote that one.  Yeah, I know.  Or the one when they first, when the monkeys first come on and they show them in the sand 
[02:44:30]  and all that.  Oh, yeah.  They're the favorite songs.  The only person I think that wrote songs for the record albums, I think, was Michael  Nesmith.  I think so, too.  You know, his mother.  We went to see him.  His mother invented whiteout.  We went to a monkey convention.  We did.  She drove a monkey convention.  Anthony.  This is horrible.  Anthony, I'm going to tell you something.  His mother invented whiteout.  Honestly, God.  Yeah, you're right.  Yeah. 
[02:45:00]  I don't know.  We've gone out of a monkey convention.  I know all of that.  It was almost sold out.  So do I.  It was almost sold out.  There was people there from all over the country.  Wait, wait, wait.  All right, wait.  There's too much now.  What goes on at a monkey's convention?  There was only two monkeys there.  Nicky's in here, too.  Peter and Nicky.  I'm going to tell you something.  It wasn't just a monkey's convention.  Huh?  It wasn't just a monkey's convention.  They had Barry Williams was there.  Christopher Knight was there.  Wow.

I'm in famous Ira.  Famous Ira who?  Ira here, Ira there.  I don't know.  This guy is Ira.  She's on fire.  She's on fire today.  You don't know about us.  You should have heard about us many years ago.  Marion's scared.  Eight or nine years ago.  She's a little scared by Ira.  What do you sing?  We sing a bonjour.  We sing a lot. 
[02:49:00]  We do stand-up.  We do this.  We do that.  I mean, you don't know us?  Bubba, what does he put?  I know the twinkles.  I wanted to tell you something.  Why didn't you get the double A here, the camp driver?  A big A?  Big A.  I seen him last summer.  Oh, how about that?  At South Street Seaport.  Ira, you're single, right?  Well, Diana's single.  Diana's single.  Ah, well, maybe.  You want to go out for a drink?  Ira, do you drink?  She's going to see the monkeys.  I drink soda.  Well, you can go to Monkees where? 
[02:49:30]  Monkees, where is that?  Oh, God.  Cow face you dinner.  The monkeys.  Hey, hey, where the monkeys.  We got the monkeys in a South Park Zoo.  We got the monkeys in a rock zoo.  We got the monkeys.  Ira, what do you think?  You and Lady Di over there go see the monkeys, the band.  The monkeys, the band?  When?  When?  When?  I already have someone to go.  No, you're not, liar.  When is it?  July 17th.  That's a Wednesday.  A Wednesday, July 17th.  Are you available on a Wednesday to go, my friend Diana? 
[02:50:00]  No, I can't go.  Why can't you go, Ira?  No, no.  Why?  I have something special.  Do you work?  Oh.  Are you retired?  No, I'm retired.  Oh, so do you want to do it?  You don't have to get up the next morning.  It's pretty aggressive.  He is very aggressive.  You have nothing to do with her Wednesday.  I go to Yonkers.  Yeah, but, uh, I go to the casino.  So do I?  I've been at Resorts World Casino.  I bet you you go there.  Oh, no.  I don't go into that place if they gave me a thousand dollars.  Then where do you go in Yonkers? 
[02:50:30]  I go to Empire City.  Okay, I've been there, too.  And it's nice.  Yeah, you can bet horses up there, too.  And it's nice, and it's beautiful.  This is maddening.  It's salivating.  It's a room full of trainables.  Have I been to Atlantic City?  I've been to Atlantic City.  How many times?  Closer than that.  A lot of times.  No, we'll share with...  No, but...  You're not sharing a mic.  You're holding one in your hand.  Yeah, I know.  What are you talking to me closer than that? 
[02:51:00]  So the casinos.  Now, what's your favorite game, Ira?  Penny slots.  You play the penny slots.  You want to win on penny slots?  Yes, I do.  How much?  I can't say that.  How much do you spend on a penny slot?  I mean, people can follow me all around.  People don't tell how much they make.  But what I'm saying, when you go to a casino, you go once a week, once a month.  Twice a week.  Twice a week.  Wow.  Good for you.  Good for you.  I haven't been in a casino in years. 
[02:51:30]  I go every five months.  You go every day.  Every day?  I don't have the money every day.  If you gave me the money, I'd go every day.  You got the money.  I don't have the money.  I don't have the money to gamble with.  I play pickets every day.  That's gambling.  Well, that's different.  I play pickets every day.  What's pickets?  Tickets.  Pickets.  Pickets.  Pickets.  Over here, you call it a...  Pick three.  Pick four.  Cash five.  Pick six.  Quick pick.  Quick pick.  Pick pick. 
[02:52:00]  Lotto.  Would you be interested in maybe you and Diana going out?  Because she is single.  No, no, no, no.  Why not, Ira?  Why not?  She's not your cup of tea?  No, not my cup of tea.  What's wrong with her, Ira?  What's wrong with her?  What's wrong with Diana?  Nothing.  She's a nice person.  I think I might be a little too young for her.  What is it, though, Ira, that's not your cup of tea about her?  No, no.  What do you like in a girl?  What do you like in a girl, Ira?  What's your type?  Nice. 
[02:52:30]  Happy.  Hey, that's...  What about physically?  Are you married?  She comes in her pants real easy.  Oh, she did.  She came in her pants just before, Ira.  Okay.  She's squirting her pants.  I don't know.  She was so excited.  She got nervous.  She hasn't seen you guys in years, so she was kind of nervous.  She had a crush on Anthony.  She came in her pants.  She came in her pants.  Thanks for the reminder.  I also have a crush on Peter Tork, also.  Yeah, I know.  You said that.  You said that.  So what is it about whoever you wouldn't like?  You could be...  She's asking for some self-improvement.  Some honesty, Ira. 
[02:53:00]  Anyway, I think Peter is married, so...  Just be honest, Ira, and let her know what she could do about herself to gussy herself  up for men.  I know, I know.  Ira, comment.  I want a skinny purse.  That's right.  Well, then, you know what?  We'll get you fixed up with Smoker Patty.  We'll get you fixed up with Smoker Patty.  She skinny?  Yes, Patty.  She still skinny?  Where is she?  I don't know.  Where is she?  Wait, Ira, are they a little overweight?  Do you think... 
[02:53:30]  A little overweight.  Yeah.  Both of them?  Both of them?  No, only one.  Yeah, that would be me.  Which one?  That'd be me.  I'm not gonna say which one.  You know why?  If you say anything about me, I had to be on the silver platter.  Oh, the silver platter again.  Ira.  You can take that, Ira.  But he's looking at me, too.  Yeah.  The silver platter.  Yes, I am a little on the head of the side.  Here we do in the weather from the roof.  Here we do in the weather from the roof.  It's gonna be very, very warm and humid. 
[02:54:00]  We know that already.  Are you a baseball fan?  Who do you like?  Mets or Yankees?  I like the Mets.  Oh, no.  So do I.  Oh, man.  What am I doing?  Bobo, I'm smiling.  Would you go to a game with Bobo?  Bobo!  Would you date Bobo?  You mean to tell him you're gay?  Bobo.  Bobo?  Bobo, are you gonna take that?  Hold on, hold on.  Bobo.  Remember, this weekend is a gay pride parade.  Oh, that means you're gay. 
[02:54:30]  What's going on?  No, I am not.  So why did you bring that up, then?  Yes.  Whoa.  Why did you bring the gay pride parade up?  I think Ira will bring that up because he's gonna watch it.  It would be nice for everybody.  Oh, Bobo jumping in.  Would you go to a game with Bobo?  Would you go to a gay parade?  Would you go to a gay pride parade that goes right down the village?  Yes.  From 23rd?  Yes.  Do you go every year?  He's probably watching it.  He's probably celebrating watching that parade.  It's George Bobo.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Bobo's had it.  Bobo!  Bobo, what do you think? 
[02:55:00]  Bobo, what do you think about Ira and the gay parade?  He's probably secretly celebrating watching that.  Or he's probably getting confused with the trannies.  Whoa!  He's probably getting confused.  He says, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Don't wait.  It was a tranny.  They did a good job with no surgery.  And he's in the same place.  The same place he never got.  And I bet you he gets really confused with the Japanese ones.  Whoa!  It really works for you, guys.  We all know the Japanese are good at that surgery. 
[02:55:30]  If Jerry heard this, he'd invite you to the game immediately.  In a second.  That's funny stuff.  He likes witty, witty banter.  Yes.  That's funny stuff.  Jerry loves it.  Ira, he's giving me the business there, Bobo.  Bobo!  Oh, this is no good, Bobo.  You sound like you're drunk.  Oh.  You okay?  Do you drink?  Did somebody put something in your coffee?  Yeah.  Bobo!  Bobo!  Wow!  Bobo delivers.  It's a rat pack. 
[02:56:00]  I'd like you to be meeting everybody.  Have a good weekend.  Oh, Ira.  I mean, 86 to 90 degrees.  Oh.  Wear a hat in the sun.  Thank you for your fault.  And go swimming.  What?  You got a pool?  What about check the elderly?  I'll go to Anthony's house for his pool.  Oh, yeah?  I'll send you to Atlantic City.  You don't get his address.  I'll be there tomorrow, Ant.  Oh, yeah?  Ira?  Yeah, after the Met game.  All right.  Ira, would you go to a game with Bobo? 
[02:56:30]  No, I would not.  Why not?  He wants to go to a game with Bobo.  I wouldn't.  Wow, you don't like Bobo?  Bobo is a nice guy.  Bobo, have a good weekend.  Enjoy it.  I have to get back to my other position.  Oh, have fun.  I guess you'll be going to the game parade on Sunday, right?  I am going to be on Fifth Avenue.  We're waving a rainbow flag.  That is right.  That's right.  Are you going to try to suck my dick at that parade or something?

[03:01:30]  Audio entertainment courtesy of the people you hear and hear about on the Opie and Anthony  Show.  This week, Tom Papa's SiriusXM show, Come to Papa.  Hello, everybody.  Thank you for coming out tonight.  Welcome to the show.  I am Tom Papa.  And we are broadcasting tonight from the Village Underground Nightclub in New York City  here on West 3rd Street in Greenwich Village.  Summer is in full swing and so are the hard-working trannies. 
[03:02:00]  Thank you all for listening and thank all of you who came out to join us in our live audience.  I don't want to get you all cocky, but you are quickly gaining the reputation as one of  the best comedy audiences in the city.  That is really true.  If it keeps up, I might have to see other audiences.  But don't get mad if I do.  Please welcome our trusty announcer, Rick Crome, everybody.  Rick Crome. 
[03:02:30]  Thanks, Tom.  Tonight's show is being brought to you by Larry's Liver Chews for Humans.  Why should your dog get all the treats?  Now, enjoy the gamey taste of liver rolled up in a chewy snack just for you.  Liver taste.  Liver breath.  Larry's Liver Chews.  Woof, woof, woof.  Don boy, that's for me.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome our amazing band made up of the greatest jazz musicians 
[03:03:00]  and womanizers in the country.  Elio and the Come to Papa trio.  Woof, woof.  Woof, woof.  Woof, woof.  Woof, woof.  Woof, woof.  Woof, woof.  Woof, woof.  Woof, woof.  Woof, woof.  With all the spying, strip searching, and snooping going on in the news, I decided to make privacy  the theme of tonight's show.  I will be watching you.  You know, a great debate rages on about what we are willing to give up in the name of safety. 
[03:03:30]  Freedom versus security.  Private versus public.  Underwear versus outerwear.  On the one hand, we don't like it when people snoop on us.  We don't want to feel like we aren't totally free.  Because we are a free people.  Free to do what we want, when we want, to whomever we want to do it to.  So how dare the government look at my emails, my private thoughts.  That would get in the way of me posting the very same thoughts on Twitter and Facebook.  Hey, government, don't cock block my blog. 
[03:04:00]  It seems like a strange debate.  A culture yelling about privacy as we willingly give it up every day to anyone who will listen.  I mean, what's more upsetting?  The government listening to our phone calls?  Or people posting pics of their children and their families in a never-ending news feed?  Why are you sending me pictures of you in the Bahamas?  I don't need to see you on a vacation that I'm not on. 
[03:04:30]  And I don't care about your children.  I'm glad you had them.  I don't want them.  I don't need the updates, the trophies, the games, the costumes.  If you feel free to show me everything, then I should feel free to comment about everything.  These are my kids at the beach.  Well, I don't think the fat one looks very healthy.  This is my husband in the kitchen.  Well, those pants your husband is wearing lends me to think he might have a boyfriend on the side. 
[03:05:00]  Why are these people willing to give up their privacy?  I don't understand it.  I love private.  Private is an island that you create that no one can enter and no one can judge.  I do things when I'm alone that I would never share.  Because if I did, I would be arrested.  And that's what we are afraid of.  Why are we afraid of being watched?  Because everybody does a little something wrong.  Everybody.  But that's why you don't have to worry.  Because they aren't interested in your little something. 
[03:05:30]  How do we know?  Because you've been watched forever and nothing has happened.  It's naive to think that you haven't been watched forever.  Not just by the government, but by the police, the private security firms, the Gap, Google, even that asshole Jared from Subway.  It's ironic that the freedom of information has led to the biggest revelation about the lack of freedom that we really have.  We're living in a fascinating time.  Everything is noble.  The good stuff and the bad. 
[03:06:00]  And the knowledge is used for good and for evil.  But I think it's mostly good.  All this freedom makes it tough for the bad guys to hide.  Imagine if Twitter was around during slavery.  There wouldn't have been slavery if the slaves be tweeting.  Posting pics of the fat plantation owners.  Yo, this cracker's going down tonight.  Can I get a retweet?  But of course the information could be dangerous if the wrong people control it. 
[03:06:30]  And that's where the conspiracy theories start.  Yeah, man, but what happens if they collect all this data  and eventually some kid makes a robot in his garage  who eats their dog and uses his dog DNA to become a robot dog  who rises to power with the support of the pet lobbies  and gets into office and decides to round up all the humans  for his master plan of turning the world into a giant robot dog park. 
[03:07:00]  What then?  Sometimes it makes you want to run and hide.  There's only one way  to live off the grid  in a cabin  in the woods  hunt for your own food  make your own shelter  return to nature  where the noise subsides  and real life becomes important again.  It sounds good.  I would totally live off the grid. 
[03:07:30]  I would  if I wasn't afraid of losing all my Twitter followers.  Oh, Tom.  Yes, Rick.  Let me ask you.  Do you have a hard time with your fans invading your privacy?  You know, I kind of do, Rick.  I, uh, you know, most of the time  like I'll be in a coffee shop somewhere  and it's crowded 
[03:08:00]  and no one's saying anything to me  but I can totally feel that they want to.  Wow.  How do you deal with that?  Well, Rick, it's the price you pay for stardom  but, you know, I kind of keep it in perspective.  You know, some guys can't handle it the way that I do.  They get carried away, you know.  Some guys are just really needy  and kind of sleazy.  Hi, Tom.  Hey, it's famous comedian Jim Norton, everybody. 
[03:08:30]  Sorry, Tom.  I would have been here sooner  but a small gaggle of fans  stopped to hassle me upstairs.  Yeah, I get it.  I get it.  That happens to me all the time.  Yeah, it's really irritating.  I feel like I can't go anywhere lately  without being mob.  Yeah, I know what you mean.  No, Tom, you don't.  I feel like I shouldn't complain, though.  I mean, it's the price I pay  for being on the A-list.  A-list, I mean, Jimmy. 
[03:09:00]  You know, you're a star  but, you know, you're not that big a star.  Well, in this room, I am, Tom.  Let's be honest.  I'm probably the biggest name  you've ever had on this shitty show.  No, no, no, no.  I had Colin Quinn once.  Exactly.  Look, I'm not complaining.  It's just that you legitimately  have to give up a lot  when you're famous.  Yeah, I'm with you.  No, Tom, you're not, really.  No, I totally am.  Wow, it must be so hard for you guys.  Hey, it's Amy Schumer, everybody. 
[03:09:30]  Thank you.  That's not why I do this,  but thank you.  Wow, you poor superstars.  I can't imagine  what it must be like for you guys.  No, we weren't really saying it like that.  Thank you so much, by the way,  for doing those small little bits  on my TV show  that's on every week  at 10.30 on Comedy Central.  Tuesdays.  Thank you.  Sincerely, thank you  for putting me on that show.  I know you have a family.  I haven't seen it,  but I'm available  if you have season two. 
[03:10:00]  Maybe I can have some lines this time.  Yeah, I think we're going  to go in another direction,  but, you know,  being a star of a hit TV show,  it's something I hope  you guys never,  and I feel like you never  will have to deal with.  I mean, I literally,  I can't even eat in a restaurant  without people just coming over to me  and just telling me  how much they love me.  Yeah, that happened to me once.  No, when it happens to me,  they're fans.  They're not people I came with.  Oh. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah.  Well, I guess,  I guess when it comes  to dealing with fame,  we're all pretty much the same,  right, guys?  No, no, no, no, we're not,  but that's so cute  that you think we are.  So cute.  Well, look, I mean,  I did have a girl  follow me up to my apartment  last night.  Jimmy, was she a prostitute?  Of course she was.  No, she was a fan  who I paid to have sex with me.  Well, look, yeah,  I mean, we're all,  maybe there's a little  different levels here,  but we all have to deal  with the invasion of privacy  because, you know, 
[03:11:00]  let's face it,  we're all pretty famous.  I'm just slightly more famous.  Yeah, but I'm, like,  the most famous.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  That's more than we got.  Hey, it's my movie star friend,  Matt Damon.  Yeah, I just,  I was walking by,  I heard you guys talking,  I just had to come up 
[03:11:30]  and say I just,  I just feel so bad  for you guys.  You were listening?  Mm-hmm.  How much of that  did you hear?  All of it.  Cool, cool.  No, I mean,  it just must be so hard  for you guys  having to deal  with all the people  not bothering you.  It is pretty tough sometimes.  I can imagine.  I mean,  I've heard what radio  can be like  and cable TV.  Wow.  Yeah, I mean, 
[03:12:00]  they rerun it  on the internet, too.  Jeez, well, yeah.  You guys should probably rest.  You must just be mobbed  all the time.  So I guess that's,  that's why you guys  are in these disguises?  No, these aren't,  this is how we dress.  These aren't disguises.  We always look like this.  Wow.  Uh, excuse me,  Mr. Damon? 
[03:12:30]  No, Mr. Matt is fine.  Cool.  Mr. Matt,  can I take a picture with you?  God, Jimmy.  Jimmy,  Jimmy,  this is everything  we're talking about.  It's bad enough  to have to give up  your privacy all day,  but now,  during the show,  with your peers?  I'm not a peer, Tom.  I'm a worm  who wants a picture.  Hold on,  wait a minute.  Are you,  aren't you the guy  from Last Comic Standing?  Oh, God.  Funny you should ask, Matt. 
[03:13:00]  I was on Last Comic Standing.  Yeah, me too,  but I came in fourth.  Not a huge deal,  but worth mentioning.  I love that show.  I taped every episode  on my VCR,  and I duct taped them together  into my own box set.  That's a little creepy.  I even,  I actually took a class.  I learned how to make  your head shots  into refrigerator magnets.  Wow,  that's,  that's really weird.  You think,  you think I could maybe  get a picture with you guys?  Uh,  yeah.  Sure.  This is so cool. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah.  Hey,  can you guys tell me,  um,  what,  what was Bill Bellamy like?  It's a little personal, Matt.  Boundaries.  Okay,  boundaries.  You guys are even cooler  in person.  That's Jim Norton,  Amy Schumer,  and Matt Damon,  everybody.  They'll all be back 
[03:14:00]  later in the show.  That sketch was brought to you  by Benny's Butter Bags.  Tired of dealing with  sticks of butter?  Butter packets got you down?  Well,  enjoy Benny's Butter Bags.  A whole bunch of butter  in a bag.  All right.  Now it's time for our  first comedian of the night.  He is one of my favorites.  He is a good friend of mine.  He lives here in New York City.  The very funny 
[03:14:30]  and talented  Mr. John Mulaney.  Thank you, Tom.  Oh,  a standing ovation.  No.  No,  not a standing ovation.  I'm very young.  I don't deserve  a standing ovation.  Nice to see all of you.  I didn't want to  leave the house today  because I had spilled  water on my pants  like right here.  Right on my thigh.  And you know,  you get nervous  when you spill water  on your pants  here or here  because you worry 
[03:15:00]  that people are going  to think  that you peed  in your pants.  And we need to stop  being worried about that  as a society  because nobody anywhere  is peeing in their pants  and then just going  about their day  as planned.  Just like,  ah,  well now I've done it.  But I have appointments  I must soldier on.  I sure hope  that folks don't notice.  But if they do notice,  I hope they understand.  I had my email  hacked into this week,  guys.  It was very scary.  But it wasn't that bad. 
[03:15:30]  It wasn't like a virus.  It was just one  of these things  where they hacked  into my email  and they went  into my address book  and they sent everyone  whose address I had  like a weird spam link.  So everyone got  an email from me,  which was great  because I don't keep  in touch with people.  So they all heard from me  and then they all  wrote me to say  that I'd been hacked.  So I heard from everybody.  It was nice.  It was like I had a baby  or something.  Email viruses  bring people together  in amazing ways.  One buddy of mine  emailed me  and he said,  hey,  I clicked on the link  you sent.  I don't want to buy  any herbal Viagra. 
[03:16:00]  And he's not like  a funny person.  I've known him for 20 years  and he's an idiot.  So what was amazing  about that was  one,  he clicked on the link.  Who the hell  clicks on the link?  He got a blank email  with a link in it.  And this,  by the way,  this was the ugliest  internet link  I've ever seen  in my life.  It had like dollar signs  and swastikas in it.  Like it looked like  a virus.  I don't mean  an internet virus.  I mean it looked like  if HPV was a website.  He got that  in an email  and he thought,  okay, 
[03:16:30]  and he clicked on it.  He was intrigued.  And then he goes  to a website  that's selling  something called  Herbal Viagra.  And his first thought  is that I am now  selling Herbal Viagra.  And do you know  what kind of  pisses me off?  Is he thinks  that that's how  I would sell it?  That I would be  that shitty  of a salesman?  That I would just  put a link  in a blank email  with the subject line  check this out?  Which I've never  said before in my life.  And then in the  two column  I'd write everybody 
[03:17:00]  and go,  ah,  this speaks  for itself.  If I was  going to email  everybody  I've ever met  about a very  shaky new business,  I would write  a nice long  introduction letter  before I got  to the link.  I would be like,  dear friends  and family,  comedy did not  work out.  Also,  have you ever  wanted to try  Viagra,  but you fear  the harmful  additives  and preservatives  of the non-herbal 
[03:17:30]  kind?  Well,  me and my  Cayman Island  business partners  have the solution  for you.  Just click on  the swastika below  and in seconds  you'll be taken  to the world's  ugliest website.  I hope you can  read pink on purple  as that is the layout  we have chosen.  I think marijuana 
[03:18:00]  is going to be  legal soon.  I really do.  I think slowly,  I mean it's legal  for many reasons  in about 18 states.  I think it's going  to happen everywhere.  It's the first,  it's very strange.  It's the first time  I've ever seen  a law change  because the government  is just like,  fine.  Like that's  essentially what's  happening.  Because when I was  a kid it was like  say no to drugs,  drugs kill,  and then we just  kept asking for  30 years.  Like can we have  pot? 
[03:18:30]  And they were like  no.  And they were like  can we?  And then we'd get  famous people to ask  and be like  Woody Harrelson  will you ask for us?  And Bill Maher  was like  I'll ask.  And we were like  no it's okay.  The government's  just giving up  like an exhausted  mom trying to  feed five kids.  Just like you want  what?  You want chicken  fingers for breakfast?  Fine.  Have fucking  chicken fingers.  I don't care anymore.  It's really good news.  It's probably going  to be legal. 
[03:19:00]  And it's great news  unless you're a  drug dealer  and then it's  terrible news.  Because you have  a very flawed  business model.  And you will be  irrelevant fast.  A pager and a  bicycle is not  going to compete  with Amazon.com  when it comes  down to it.  And also we've  afforded drug dealers  a lot of leeway  that we don't give  to other businesses.  You know like  when the Chinese  delivery guy comes  we don't let him  hang out after  he's delivered  the Chinese food.  And we don't let  him say weird  things to the  girls we're  hanging out with. 
[03:19:30]  And we certainly  don't give him  some of the  Chinese food.  Changing  topics entirely  I got engaged  a month ago.  I got engaged  on May 9th.  Thank you very much.  Someone very male  just booed.  Someone deep  and male.  That's okay though.  I thought a lot  about it before I  did it.  Before I got engaged  I talked to a lot  of people. 
[03:20:00]  And I heard this  expression that I  guess has been  around for a long  time that people  say about marriage.  People say why  buy the cow when  you can get the  milk for free.  It's been around  for a long time  that expression.  Where does that  come from?  Why buy the cow  when you can get  the milk for free?  You're not allowed  to milk a cow  that you don't own.  That's not allowed  in the dairy community.  Was that happening  at some point?  Some Dutch prick  sneaking into a barn  late at night.  He was like  I take your milk 
[03:20:30]  and the farmer was  like well that's  your cow now.  And he's like  no proof of purchase  and he ran off  into the night.  The expression  means why would  you marry someone  if they're already  having sex with you?  Which has nothing  to do with what  real relationships  are like.  Why buy the cow?  Maybe because  every day the cow  asks you when  you're going to  buy it.  And you live  in a really small  apartment with the cow.  So you can't  avoid that question 
[03:21:00]  at all.  And also the cow  is way better  at arguing than  you are.  And almost seems  to enjoy arguing.  Why buy the cow?  Maybe because  every time another  cow gets bought  you have to go  to the sale  and you  you have to  sit next to  your cow  and your cow  looks at you  like  and like  she does not  enjoy the sale  at all.  Especially because  that farmer and cow  met like a year  after you guys met. 
[03:21:30]  Why buy the cow?  Well okay  to be fair  there's a lot  of other cows  out there  that's true  but you know  never forget  you weren't  particularly good  at talking to cows.  You're very lucky  to have the cow  that you do have.  Roping in cows  and getting milk  from them  was never anything  you were good at.  A lot of people  think you like bulls  and you could just  put those rumors  to rest.  If you bought the cow  nobody would say that.  Well not as many  people would say that.  And honestly guys  why buy the cow? 
[03:22:00]  Honestly  because you love her.  You really do.  And sure  she's a bossy  little Jew  but  she makes  your life better.  And you don't  want to be 50 years  old walking around  like hey  you seen any  loose milk?  Take care  everybody.  John Mulaney  everybody. 
[03:22:30]  You know  every debate  about privacy  leads back to  Big Brother  doesn't it?  Who is  Big Brother?  Is Big Brother  watching us?  What does Big Brother  want?  What does Big Brother  what does it even mean?  I'll tell you  what it means.  Watch out.  Big Brother  is in the house.  Got my eyes on you. 
[03:23:00]  You're Big Brother?  Hell yeah.  Got my eyes on you.  All of you.  Wow.  You don't believe  there really is  a Big Brother  do you?  I didn't say that.  You don't have to say it.  I know what you're  thinking.  I'm Big Brother.  Got my eyes on you.  All of you.  Now I  I knew there was  a Big Brother  but I just didn't think  You didn't think 
[03:23:30]  you would look like me.  What did you expect?  A scrawny ass  white dude?  I'm Big Brother  with a capital B  baby.  Well Mr.  Well Mr. Brother  you have been  very very busy  lately.  It seems like  you've been really  stepping up your game.  That's what I do.  You can't hide from me.  I'm stronger than ever.  Got new HD cameras  all over the place.  Hacked the entire  internet.  I even got myself  Netflix  and a new Apple TV. 
[03:24:00]  Got my eyes on  Walking Dead  season 2.  Watch out!  That's great.  I never knew  zombies were real.  I ain't putting  my eyes on them.  Yeah.  I have to say  after meeting you  I'm a little less  freaked out.  You don't seem  like a bad guy.  You don't know me.  You don't know  what I'm capable of.  This is the first stage  of my master plan.  This is the  information collecting  stage.  Well I don't mind  you collecting information 
[03:24:30]  as long as it doesn't  end up in the wrong hands.  You don't think  these hands are wrong?  Oh these hands  are way wrong.  So wrong.  Mr. Bedwetter.  Excuse me?  You heard me.  You went to bed  until you were 16.  Or didn't you think  I knew that?  I don't think  this is important.  You don't think  period.  Mr. I cheated  on my SATs.  Alright.  Alright.  I get it.  Didn't think  I knew that one either. 
[03:25:00]  I'm big brother  got my peepers  on you baby.  All of you.  But as embarrassing  as that is  you wouldn't give  that information  to other people  would you?  I just did  dummy.  And if the price  is right  I'll sell them  even more.  But you wouldn't  sell to just anyone.  Hell no.  Oh that's good.  I only sell to  whoever has  the most cash.  Political parties  CEOs  ex-wives. 
[03:25:30]  Ooh that's a little  scary.  I would sell  to the devil  if he's quoting  the right place.  Well look  I'm not worried  about you  because you know  frankly  now that information  is more available  the tables have turned.  We're watching you now.  Watch out.  You got nothing  on me.  Any kid with a laptop  and some time  can find out  anything he wants  on his own.  Please.  All he can find  is Katy Perry  titty videos.  What about that  WikiLeaks guy?  That giant albino?  He ain't talking  so big now. 
[03:26:00]  Watch out.  What about the  Chinese?  Now shut your mouth.  I don't like  the Chinese.  They confuse me.  It's like  everything they do  is in Chinese.  That's because  they're Chinese.  You don't seem  that smart.  Don't have to be.  Just have to be  busy.  Watching you  when you're sleeping  and watching  when you're awake.  I'm like Santa  with more bandwidth. 
[03:26:30]  And just  and you just  have to trust me  that I'll keep you safe.  Unless the Chinese  show up.  Damn the Chinese.  Got my eyes on you.  Big Brother everybody.  Watching you too  guy in the front row.  Your girlfriend  is up for no good.  Just thought  he should know.  One more time  for Big Brother.  Big Brother  was brought to you  by  Drunkster's Adult Diapers.  Tired of interrupting 
[03:27:00]  all your drinking fun  with constant trips  to the bathroom.  Now you can  stay on the bar stool  all night long  with Drunkster's Adult Diapers.  Drunkster's  putting the buzz  back in your pants.  You know who would be  great to comment  on all this privacy stuff  if only he was alive?  Who, Tom?  The great Andy Rooney  from 60 Minutes.  Remember that guy? 
[03:27:30]  Your wish is my command.  Ladies and gentlemen,  please welcome  from 60 Minutes  in the sky  Andy Rooney.  Have you ever  dropped your phone  in the toilet?  I have.  Not my cell phone either.  It was one of those  big ones with the cord.  Made it a lot easier 
[03:28:00]  to pull out.  All this talk  about privacy  is giving me  the heebie-jeebies.  Who are these people  poking around  in my business?  What do they want?  I'm not a terrorist.  The only group  I belong to  is the Katona  Bowling League.  Have you ever  had sex  in a bowling alley?  I have.  I'm not proud of it.  But I couldn't  control it.  Something about  hearing Dolores  say the words 
[03:28:30]  gutterball  got me crazy.  I've never been  very good  at having sex  standing up.  Seems like a good idea.  But then my legs  give out  like a newborn giraffe.  Have you ever  gotten a hand job  in a zoo?  I have.  I'm not even sure  who it was from. 
[03:29:00]  That's the problem  with the nocturnal exhibits.  You never know  who's watching who.  I'm not worried  about all this  spying stuff.  They never find  anything good anyway.  Have you ever  snooped in someone's  diary and put on  their bra and panties  and started  pleasuring yourself  just as they walk  back into the room?  I have.  It's hard to get  out of that situation.  I just tell them  it's a compliment 
[03:29:30]  and finish the job.  And that's what  privacy is all about.  The great  Andy Rooney  everybody.  Have you ever  gone prostitute shopping  in Brazil  with a bag full  of Viagra?  Our keyboardist  has.  Andy Rooney  everybody.  Have you ever  talk, have you ever  walk in late  to an orgy  and realize  you're the only  one covered 
[03:30:00]  in KY  and candy?  I have.  Andy Rooney  everyone.  Andy was brought  to you by  Trident Gummy  Teeth.  Real false  teeth made out  of real gummy  candies.  Park them in  in the morning  and suck on  them all day.  Trident Gummy  Teeth.  For the little  kid inside your  mouth. 
[03:30:30]  That's so funny.  I totally didn't  write it that  way.  I really didn't.  I meant like  little kid.  And try all  our new Trident  Gummy Sours.  You really can't  follow a kid  in your mouth.  I don't know  why I did the 
[03:31:00]  tagline.  You already have  a kid in your  mouth.  We were professional  comedians.  We were in  rehearsal going  through it and  still nothing but  you people, the  comedy connoisseurs.  The great Rick  Crome, everybody.  That's good stuff.  Who's even playing  at the Blue Note  tonight?  What hack is over  there?  Some old dude on  a stool.  Slobbering through  his trumpet. 
[03:31:30]  Elia, one more  time.  Give it up.  Maury and Alex.  You guys having a  good time?  All right.  All right.  Now I'm going to  bring up another  comedian who's  another very good  friend of mine.  You guys know him  as the Latino  correspondent on  The Daily Show.  My good friend,  the hilarious Al  Madrigal, everybody.  I have to follow 
[03:32:00]  the fucking band.  What's happening?  How are you?  I am the Latino  correspondent, which  is ridiculous because  my Spanish is fucking  non-existent and I'm  the worst Mexican  ever.  This is like an  assimilation mission  accomplished right  here.  That's what  everybody's working  towards.  I didn't even  know I was a  Latino.  I didn't consider 
[03:32:30]  myself a Latino  comedian or a  Mexican comic until  I didn't know anyone  else considered me as  a Latino comic until  I moved to Los  Angeles.  I actually went down  there for the first  time.  It was an audition  for the HBO Comedy  Arts Festival and I  went down with a  couple other San  Francisco comedians  who went to the  Hollywood Improv and  everybody was set up  in the audition and  you checked in and  everybody, all my  friends got HBO  comedy t-shirts that I  was very excited to  get.  And then I went to  check in and they  gave me a tin of  red hots that said 
[03:33:00]  HBO Latino.  And I looked at my  red hots and I  looked at everybody  else's t-shirts and  then I went to go  check in and all my  friends were on the  Thursday night show  at 830 and I was on  the Friday night late  show with Gabriel  Iglesias, Freddy Soto,  Jeff Garcia, Carlos  Mencia, hosted by  Pablo Francisco.  And I looked at my  friend Becky and  me and Becky went  down and none of 
[03:33:30]  those guys were  hanging out with  anybody named Becky.  And I said, Becky,  I'm a Mexican comedian.  And at that moment a  guy tapped me on the  shoulder and he goes,  hola, my name is  Mateo, I'm with HBO  Latino, do you mind  if we interview you  on Spanish?  And I go, you can  fucking try, man.  Ha, that's not good.  And by the way,  como se dice, where's  my fucking t-shirt?  Fucking, the fuck? 
[03:34:00]  I live in Los Angeles,  I go back and forth  and I have problems  with my neighbors.  I got a lot of  neighbor beef.  I live on a block  with all old people  that are constantly  in my business,  trimming my hedges  and shit like that.  And I figured out  a great way to deal  with these people  on the subway.  I was on the subway  here.  I took the F from  Brooklyn and I was  on 14th and 23rd  you can get a cell  phone signal.  So I hadn't looked  at my phone in  about four minutes  so I was anxious  to take a peek 
[03:34:30]  at what was going  on and look at my  phone and underground  select a wireless  network became  available to me.  And the wireless  network that was  available underground  was lick underscore  my balls.  So I'll think  about that for a  second.  Underground wireless  network available.  It used to be that  if you wanted to tell  an anonymous group  of people to lick  your balls,  you'd have to go  to a truck stop  and carve that  into the side  of a toilet paper  dispenser. 
[03:35:00]  Work on it  maybe over time.  Hope that some  trucker would sit  down and go,  motherfucker.  Fucker.  But now with  technology it allows  us to create a  mobile hotspot and  send the signal of  lick my balls out to  a group of people in  a two block radius.  Do you understand how  fantastic this is?  Why aren't we all  doing this at all  times?  I immediately went  home and changed my  wireless network name  to send that signal. 
[03:35:30]  You clearly have  wireless at your home.  What is your  wireless name?  What do you call  it?  Free internet.  That's a waste.  Why don't you  fucking change it  to something good?  We all live near  creepy people.  You can do this.  I just want everybody  to go home and  change yours to  I see what you do.  I'm like,  he's on to us.  So I changed mine  immediately and went  home.  I have one in the  front part of the  house because we  have a little tiny  house but I have  an attached garage. 
[03:36:00]  I have two networks.  So I changed the  first one to how  many cars do two  people need?  That's my first  one.  And then my second  one in the back is  awful lot of vodka  bottles in your  recycling.  I'm just saying.  That's a lot of  vodka.  My daughter is now,  I have kids and my  daughter is, this is  the way I used to  communicate to the  neighbors.  Every Halloween I  have this gorgeous 
[03:36:30]  little daughter that  would say anything  that wanted to.  So every Halloween  I'd whisper to her  and she'd go  trick-or-treating and  deliver messages to  the neighbors that  way.  So Tinkerbell would  walk up, trick-or-treat,  trick-or-treat, and  they'd give her the  candy and she'd say,  thank you very much.  When are you going to  do something about  your fence?  You can do that.  I'm having to  answer, speaking  to the kids, I'm  having to answer a  lot of questions that  I didn't anticipate. 
[03:37:00]  My son just  recently asked me  why R. Kelly's  sheets smell like  pee.  Because of the  songs Thrift Shop  by Macklemore and  Ryan Lewis.  I now have these  two kids that are  obsessed with popular  music and they're  printing out lyrics  constantly and  reading way too  much.  And she said,  Father, when  Kesha says that  she's going to  brush her teeth  with a bottle of  Jack and don't  wait up because  she's not coming  back, what does  that mean?  I'm like, Kesha 
[03:37:30]  just loves rhyming.  It's more about  the rhyming for  Kesha than the  intention to brush  with that.  So when my son  asked me why R. Kelly  sheets smell like  pee, I just said,  he's known to have  peed the bed, which  technically is true.  I just left out the  fact that he's  awake at the time  and standing over  two girls about  your age.  Kesha and, um, 
[03:38:00]  let's see if  my face goes.  That was for the  don't clap for them.  That was for the  band dig earlier.  Eh, that's  fucking, watch  your ass.  All right.  They're so baked  right now they have  no idea what the  fuck is happening.  I also, uh, with, uh,  the kids, I found  myself, um, dealing 
[03:38:30]  with racism on, it  was in a commercial  I had, uh, watching  son, my son, we  were watching  television and, um,  he's about 10  years old and, uh,  we had a commercial  come on that was  the most racist  commercial I've ever  seen in my entire  life.  Uh, it's a golden  corral commercial.  I'm not sure if  you're familiar with  the horrible chain  of buffet restaurants  that, uh, plagues  Florida.  And, uh, I've never  been to one of these  places.  I just assume it's a  bunch of cut-up hot 
[03:39:00]  dogs and dudes just  shoveling shit in their  mouths.  Uh, uh, but  Golden, uh, the  buffet restaurant, uh,  has, uh, Golden  Corral has a, uh,  commercial where a  white couple and a  black couple are on  a double date.  You've seen this.  The most racist  thing ever.  Um, and the black  couple's in the back  seat and the, the  white lady turns to  this, uh, black  couple and she goes,  we're gonna have  such a great time on  this double date.  We're gonna go to  the seafood restaurant.  Chef Jason's gonna be  there.  And then we're gonna  share a $20 appetizer. 
[03:39:30]  And then the black  people hear a $20  appetizer and they  look at each other  and they're like,  fuck that shit.  Uh, and they throw  themselves from the  moving vehicle, uh,  risking their lives  to dust their asses  off and show up at  Golden Corral where  you can eat all you  can eat tilapia.  That's what it says.  All you can eat  tilapia, Golden  Corral.  Just like Facebook  has lowered the value  of what it means to  have a friend. 
[03:40:00]  Uh, Golden Corral  is severely lowering  the standards for  what it takes to  jump out of a  moving vehicle.  What's Dukes of  Hazzard used to be  the brakes, right?  The brakes are out.  Somebody cut the  brake line or maybe  there's a cliff or  a bomb, a combination  of all three.  Kidnapping situation.  Maybe that's the  case.  Maybe these, uh,  people were so  desperate to have  black friends, uh,  that they have taken  them hostage, right,  and kidnapped their  asses and then  decided they were  gonna feed them  after torturing them  for three weeks 
[03:40:30]  and the Golden  Corral was their  first opportunity.  I don't think,  my son said, uh,  this, he goes,  why didn't they  stop?  Which is true.  Why didn't the  Golden Corral,  they just throw in  a fucking brake  sound effect just  to imply that the  white people gave a  shit.  Uh, uh, uh, uh,  why didn't they do  that?  There should have  been a brake sound  effect just to  suggest that the  white people went  running into the  Golden Corral  afterwards and  go, what the  fuck?  Uh, if you  wanted to eat here,  you could have  just told us you  want to eat here.  We just wanted to  eat here.  You're company. 
[03:41:00]  We didn't know you  wanted cotton candy  as a dessert option.  Uh, it's a walking  dessert.  I will give you a  little bit of advice  if you're going to  have, um, uh, kids  someday, I'll leave  you with this.  Um, uh, never give  anybody your phone  number at the park.  I know that seems  like something you  would never do.  Who does that tell  what's where hubbos  exchange information.  But don't give  anyone your phone  number. 
[03:41:30]  What will happen is  you'll have kids,  you'll bring them to  a playground, and  then the kids will  start playing with  some other kids,  and then what will  happen is the  mother will come  up, and then all  of a sudden you'll  be on playdates and  events with these  park people.  And I don't want  to ever hang out  with the fucking  park people.  I hate the park  people.  I want to hang  out with my  friends, people I  have stuff in  common with.  I remember when  my son was little,  I actually took  over the playdates,  and I was hanging  out, we were over  at a barbecue that  I arranged.  My son hated the  kid, but I didn't  fucking care, because  I liked these 
[03:42:00]  people.  And my son came  running up at one  point, and he  goes,  Trevor bit me.  I go, come here,  let me explain this  to you.  Trevor's daddy has  box seats at the  Staples Center, and  Trevor's mommy is a  former Hawaiian  tropic model, and  likes to wear tight  fitting clothing and  high heels.  You better work it  out, because we're  staying friends with  Trevor, and I don't  care if he's a  fucking cannibal.  You make it happen.  All right, thank you  very much. 
[03:42:30]  Al Madrigal,  everybody.  Al Madrigal.  Rick, we've been  friends a long time.  Oh, you can say  that.  You seem like a  very private person,  though.  I really don't know  that much about you.  I am.  I mean, well, I  was.  I still sort of am.  I don't know, like, 
[03:43:00]  even basic things  about you.  What's your favorite  color?  It's kind of a  silly question.  It's just an  innocent question.  What's your favorite  color?  Why is it so  important?  It's not important  at all.  All right, fine.  I'm gay.  Is that what you  wanted me to hear?  All right, I watch  Glee.  I sing show tunes.  There's a kid living  in my mouth.  Fine. 
[03:43:30]  I just wanted to  know what color he  likes.  You Tom Papa?  I am.  We're the  government.  You're the  government?  Yeah, we are the  government.  Well, how can I  help you?  There's been some  trouble.  A lot of  trouble.  There it is.  And we...  And we need 
[03:44:00]  answers.  Answers to  questions.  About where you  were during the  trouble.  Why do you guys  talk like that?  We have  Asperger's.  Asperger's.  Well, what  trouble?  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Slow down there,  McGillagorilla.  We're the ones  asking the  questions.  You do the  answering, wise  guy.  And the law  says you've  got to tell us  everything.  So where were  you last night  around midnight,  bub? 
[03:44:30]  I was home.  Who's home?  My home.  My apartment.  At midnight, I was  in bed.  You make me sick.  What were you  doing in bed,  Red Skelton?  That's none of  your business.  Listen,  Lummox,  everything you do  is our business.  That's the  business we're in,  Flapjack.  Flapjack?  It means  pancake,  Costanza.  Now listen up.  What were you 
[03:45:00]  doing in bed  around midnight?  I guess I was  on the computer  for a little bit.  Go time.  Oh, it's on,  baby.  It's on.  What the hell  does that mean?  You asked for it.  Bring in  Toots McGee.  All right,  I'm coming,  I'm coming,  you big galoot.  Now is this  the guy?  Yeah,  that's him.  That's the stiff.  Bingo.  Oh, wait a minute.  I've never seen  Toots McGee  in my life. 
[03:45:30]  Well,  we didn't  each see  each other  see each other  on account  that we was  on the  World Wide Web.  So you were  both on the  Internet at the  same time?  Yeah, sure.  Well, yeah,  maybe, but along  with maybe a  billion other  people.  I bet you're  thinking some  pretty dirty  thoughts,  weren't you,  pervert?  Well, sure.  I was  talking to him.  You want to  know if I was  thinking dirty  thoughts?  Don't act like  you didn't. 
[03:46:00]  He's lying.  I can tell  he's lying.  That's enough.  Listen, Henny  Oldman, we're  going to need  your computer.  We're going to  need your  computer.  And your  phone.  And your  mail.  And your  high school  yearbook.  And any  jewelry you  have lying  around.  Wait, you  can't do  this to me.  Oh, sure we  can, Gravy  Boat.  You want to  be safe,  don't you?  Well, sure,  but...  And then open  your mouth.  We need some  DNA, creep. 
[03:46:30]  Oh, that  hurt.  This is  ridiculous.  Hey, he's  right, fellas.  There's much  more fun ways  to collect  DNA.  if you  catch my  drift.  Good one,  toots.  Wait, I  have rights.  No, you  don't.  You have  the right to  shut your  fucking pie  hole.  I love  pie.  Me too,  sister.  What do  you say we  get out of  here and  grab a slice?  Sounds  swell.  Count me  in. 
[03:47:00]  Two pie  holes.  This is  going to be  fun.  Wait a  minute.  you barge  in here,  you badger  me,  you take  my stuff,  you put  a stick  in my  mouth,  and now  you're  just going  to walk  out of  here?  That's  right,  pickles.  Pickles?  Yeah,  don't worry,  Costanza,  we're the  government.  We're  always around,  you asshole. 
[03:47:30]  See you  on the  World Wide  Web,  Big Daddy.  John  Mullaney  and Al  Macriville  and Cynthia  Corey,  everybody.  You know,  all this  talk about  privacy  really stirs  up a lot  of debate  and it  really kind  of took  off  immediately  because the  issue 
[03:48:00]  is not  just about  snooping  and freedom.  it's really  all tangled  together with  a changing  and really  unknowable  future.  A future  where many  of the  traditional  systems and  communities and  structures that  we rely on  are going to  be torn down  and we feel  vulnerable in a  very real,  very new  way.  So when we  get a glimpse  of this  information  gathering,  we see a  little bit of  that future  and it makes  us nervous.  But should  we really  be that  freaked out?  I mean,  with all the  information flying  around, 
[03:48:30]  I have to  believe that  we'll progress  and find new  solutions,  new ways to  help each  other because  I believe that  is where our  collective spirit  always drives us,  to help and  protect each  other.  It's in us  because whenever  you help  someone,  there's always  that outside  chance that  you might get  laid.  So in a way,  the more we  know about each  other,  the better off  we'll be.  Is it scary  too?  Yeah,  it's really  scary.  There are  always bad  people with  bad organizations  trying to  destroy and 
[03:49:00]  with all the  technology and  the freedom,  not only can  they know  more,  but they can  destroy more.  Just look at  what all those  bloggers did to  Will Smith's  last movie.  After Earth.  Someone actually  called it  After Birth.  That is tragic.  And this kid  was in it.  Sure, we're  being watched,  but we're  also doing  some watching  ourselves.  We peer out  from behind  our laptops  and up from  our smartphones  looking if we  see something  that needs  saying something  about to 
[03:49:30]  somebody about  something.  But what are  we doing?  Really?  It's just  collecting stories  and that's  what makes  us human.  The poetry,  the novels,  the short  stories,  the blogs,  the posts,  the updates  from tweets,  they're just  stories.  Stories that  give us  balance as  we try and  figure out all  these complex  issues.  And now that  everyone,  everyone has  the power to  tell their  story,  you have to  think that  there's a  greater chance  that we'll  all be  inspired like  never before.  I heard this  story the other 
[03:50:00]  day about a  guy who changed  jobs to spend  more time with  his family.  And on the  first day he  woke up and  he had breakfast  with his family.  And at the  time he would  normally have been  commuting,  he got to take  his son outside  for a walk  around the  neighborhood.  And he said  it gave him  such peace to  see his little  boy, this  little version of  himself,  walking down  the sidewalk.  And his son  looked back at  the father and  he smiled and  he pulled down  his pants and  peed on his  neighbor's car.  And just then  a dog ran up 
[03:50:30]  and mounted the  boy like a  friend.  I don't know  what that means  but it's a good  story.  So let them  gather what they  will and have  faith that it's  going to do us  some good and  protect yourself  as well.  Protect what's  important to  you.  Don't send  out pictures  of your kids  unless you're  worried that  they look weird  and you need  validation.  Don't let the  world know  stuff that you  haven't told your  family yet.  And no matter  how good you  think you look 
[03:51:00]  when you're  drunk alone in  a hotel room,  do not take  the picture and  send it to  anyone.  Not.  Not everything  has to go out.  Something should  be kept in.  Just pose in  front of the  mirror if you  have to and  keep it to  yourself.  That's the  power of the  primitive mirror.  It helps you  look in at the  real you, the  human you, the  unknowable you. 
[03:51:30]  And you walk  away with all  your secrets and  all your complexities  and all your  frailties and  all your power.  And that's all  the information  you'll ever  need.  Alright, that's  our show.  A big thank you  to John Mulaney,  Al Madrigal,  Cynthia Corey,
