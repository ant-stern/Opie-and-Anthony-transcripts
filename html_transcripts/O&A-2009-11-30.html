<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts engaging in graphic sexual banter before pivoting to Opie's severe hangover, resulting from a weekend binge with friends Laszlo and Danny that culminated in alcohol poisoning.  The conversation then shifted to the firing of radio personality Maxwell from Clear Channel, followed by extensive, crude speculation about Tiger Woods' car accident, fueled by listener calls offering lurid details and theories of infidelity and a possible altercation with his wife involving a golf club.  They interspersed this with reviews of movies like *Invictus*, *The Blind Side*, *Old Dogs*, and *A Christmas Carol*, punctuated by vulgar comments and tangents.  The show then addressed the murder of four police officers in Washington state, condemning the killings and criticizing the perceived failures of the criminal justice system, focusing on the suspect's history and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee's role in commuting his sentence.

The next segment heavily focused on the police shooting, with hosts and callers expressing outrage and speculating on the shooter's motives, including the possibility of "suicide by cop."  The media's coverage was criticized, particularly the disproportionate attention given to Tiger Woods versus the police killings, and the perceived delay in reporting the shooter's race.  Concerns about racial tensions and police interactions were raised.  This segued into a critique of Van Halen's music, with song playing and debate on their merit,  mentioning Ronnie James Dio's cancer diagnosis, a blind item from a gossip website, "Climategate," and the suspension of two Clippers announcers for comments about an Iranian player.  Mad Dog Chris Russo was a scheduled but absent guest, while Jim Norton and Louis C.K. received mentions.

A further segment began with disbelief and vulgar commentary regarding NBA player Hamed Haddadi's alleged suspension for over-enunciating "Iranian."  This led to a discussion of Sasha Baron Cohen's films, *Borat* and *Bruno*, followed by the playing of a listener's birthday wishes from a local news channel, which sparked more crude jokes.  The hosts reacted strongly and offensively to news of a Florida middle school's "Kick-a-Jew Day" and a school incident involving "ball tapping."  The conversation then jumped to Captain Sully Sullenberger's post-Hudson River landing life, interwoven with sexually charged comments and a game titled "Who Has the Driest Pussy Out There?".  The discovery of a man's father being Charles Manson was also mentioned.  A call-in interview with Adam Lambert regarding his same-sex kiss at the American Music Awards was featured, followed by a lengthy in-studio segment with Chris "Mad Dog" Russo discussing sports news and Tiger Woods, concluding with more sports talk and personal anecdotes from the hosts.  Mad Dog Chris Russo was a guest in studio.

The next segment began with a discussion of Kindles, quickly shifting to college and professional football, including debates on Tim Tebow, Vince Young, the NFL's Thanksgiving game scheduling, and Bill Belichick's controversial fourth-down gamble.  The NBA, specifically the New Jersey Nets and LeBron James' potential future moves, were discussed at length.  The conversation also included Dean Memminger's life, the hosts' new smaller Sirius XM studio, a detailed description of a Disney World ride, reflections on their ages and radio careers, interactions with management, and handling of on-air controversies.  Various other sports news items, including the Heisman Trophy and upcoming games, were covered.  The segment included a caller and a visit from Lewis Black in studio, with conversation covering his commercials, new special, and experiences on the road, concluding with more humorous commentary.

The final segment featured Louis C.K. and Francine, celebrating her 30th birthday.  Topics ranged from Louis C.K.'s upcoming specials on Epix to interracial dating preferences, Francine's graphic recounting of a miscarriage, and a heated debate on healthcare reform.  The conversation became increasingly vulgar and offensive, with a caller, Priscilla, engaging in a heated argument with Opie and Anthony, culminating in personal insults and accusations of racism.  The segment concluded with Louis C.K. promoting his shows and Epix.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is dangerous.  There's nothing in the Bible that says you can't tongue an asshole.  Psychotic, sexual, devious.  I just want to take it in the shitter like a good fruit. 
[00:00:30]  Really, it is a very, very bad thing.  Go fuck yourself.  It's unbelievable.  I love it.  We know we're great.  Everyone knows we're great.  Complete horseshit.  Dude, this show is never short of cash.  We're just dicks.  We don't get you one way.  We fuck you the other way.  This is like what goes on in a mental institution.  Cookie, cookie, cookie.  Hi, I'm the O.P. and Anthony Virus.  And I'm here to infect you with hilarity.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  I forgot about the virus during the break.  Yes.  Yeah.  I forgot about everything.  Yeah, absolutely.  I kind of wound down and forgot about the show and everything.  I think I forgot about, forgot how to do radio.  I know.  I almost forgot how to wake up this morning.  Set the alarm.  I went to bed and then I realized just as I was drifting off, holy shit, I got to set my alarm.  Like I hadn't set it in, you know, over a week. 
[00:01:30]  So pop that thing on.  I'm just like, fuck.  I drove in today getting nervous.  I'm like, I guess I know how to do this.  Do we still know how to do radio?  No, I, I don't know.  Why?  I, I, I don't know.  Why?  Well, good morning.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Is this the last day of November?  Yes, it is.  How many days in November?  30 or 31?  30 days, half September, April, June, and November.  Okay.  Wow.  December starts tomorrow? 
[00:02:00]  Yup.  What the fuck?  I've been kind of lucky weather-wise here in New York anyway.  I, uh, I was biking in Central Park yesterday.  Were ya?  You should not be able to do that in late November.  Ever.  It's very cold, usually.  It wasn't cold yesterday.  I'm digging it.  Did you see yesterday?  I'm starting to think you might not have seen yesterday.  Uh, yesterday I saw, um, the ceiling of my bedroom for a while as I was writhing in pain  because my head was pounding from a, a, a, a Category 5 hangover. 
[00:02:30]  Finger of God was stirring my brains.  It was really...  And obviously your drinks.  Yeah.  Oh, the night before, that's for sure.  Did you puke?  Uh, yeah, at one point I did.  It was just like, it was pure alcohol poisoning.  Are you too old to puke, though?  Yeah, you start feeling like, what am I doing?  And I'm fucking on my knees in front of the toilet, bleh, bleh, puking, going, and this  is purely from drinking.  I'm just like, oh, what am I doing? 
[00:03:00]  What color did you get up?  Uh, it was all water.  It was just all water because I was trying to rehydrate myself.  No, I understand that, but...  Okay.  It was a tinge of pink from Pepto-Pigemol.  So, so you're puking and you're still trying to drink water as you're puking?  Dude, here's, here's my hangovers, how they work, though.  I, I stopped drinking, I believe it was 5 a.m. on Sunday morning.  Jesus.  I think.  My God, man.  It was a drink, yeah, I know, throw your arms up, thumbs the same way. 
[00:03:30]  Oof, who knows?  It started at about noon, uh, when Laszlo dropped by.  On Saturday.  Saturday, of course.  He was last Saturday before, two days after we were off.  Yes, the thing is, it's like, it was the last day you could actually party, because,  you know, I can't party on Sunday, because you've got to be in here, uh, for the vacation.  So, Laszlo's like, what are you doing, man?  I go, nothing, come on, hang out, we'll drink a few beers, whatever.  So, uh, he comes over, we're hanging out, tossing a few back, uh, so he leaves, so of 
[00:04:00]  course, you know, I text up Danny, and, uh, he's got some things to do, but he makes  it over later on, and, uh, you know, we start drinking, uh, the, the bud keg went out, so  we just start drinking the Guinness, and then, I don't know, Danny just picks up, he, he  picks up where he left off when he used to bartend, and before I know it, he's got the  shaker, he's like Tom Cruise in cocktail, he's tossing the things around.  Unfortunately, he's not like the other guy in cocktail at the end. 
[00:04:30]  It wasn't even me that started in, though.  I know.  You're like, hey, bust out shots.  Bust out the shots.  I don't even remember heading downstairs, we were upstairs for a while, just watching  TV and fucking around, and, uh, that was early on in the night, and I barely remember  even venturing downstairs.  Yeah.  What was the shot?  What was the shot of choice?  Oh, easy pussy stuff.  Yeah, it was just, uh, like amaretto and cranberry juice.  There were a lot of them.  Yeah, I think there might have been, because, uh.  And ridiculous amounts of beer.  Yeah, I, I, I definitely had a, a gigantic alcohol blackout.  Like, I'm missing big chunks of time. 
[00:05:00]  Chunks of, of Saturday night, early Sunday morning.  That usually means something happened to your fanny.  Yep.  Well, I remember, right, Jimmy?  Yes, it does.  Right, fanny sex.  I just remember at one point, like, it was kind of like waking up in the middle of a conversation,  and I just remember just going, I don't even know what I'm talking about.  So, and I think that's probably time, that was when it was time to wrap up, I think.  I went, I gotta go to bed.  So, I get up to go to bed, and I decide it was a good time to reheat up my Japanese, uh,  hibachi food. 
[00:05:30]  So, you know, I, I heat that up, and I start eating it, and I'm going, I don't feel very  well.  Ugh.  You know, to my, to myself, I'm just sitting there.  So, I'm like, let me put this in the fridge and try to get to sleep as quickly as possible.  So, I went upstairs, and I did, just crapped right out, it's called passing out, and then  uh, I woke up, I don't know, eh, kind of, I guess around noon-ish, uh, and just felt  horrid until probably when I went to sleep at one this morning. 
[00:06:00]  Jesus.  My head was still pounding, and I got to sleep.  You got to sleep?  Yeah, a little bit.  Congrats.  A little bit.  I went downstairs for a little while, too, laid down on the couch, watched some, you know,  cop shows and shit.  Did you puke when you woke up?  Yeah, dude, I, I, I puked 12 hours after I woke up.  That's, that's like, my hangovers are ridiculous.  That's why it was no food, it was all fucking water.  And, and one, like, tablespoon of Pepto-Bismol came up.  Jesus.  Let's see, you're sad, you're, let's see, Anthony, I am sad to point out the obvious. 
[00:06:30]  You are a massive drunk, no insult intended.  I, no, I'm not that massive.  Slight, slight build.  Yes, I'm a slightly, I'm a slightly built drunk.  Right, right, right.  That was one of those, you know.  No, I was at.  It was the last, last big fiesta of the season.  Before we get back to doing radio.  Yeah.  No, I was saying, when you puke and it's clear, you know, it gets to a point where you're puking  past the clear liquid coming up and then it gets into some really cool colors. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, no, no, no.  Where it's just flat out bile.  It didn't get to that.  It was a quick, um, just, I was sitting on the couch, I was fine.  I was, I was drinking some water, feeling a little better, my head still hurt, and then  all of a sudden, whoosh, that wave of nausea comes over you.  It's like, and I, I was, I was thinking, what the fuck is this?  So I trot on over to the bathroom and go, I come back up, I can't believe I'm going to  fucking puke.  But that, but that, did that, it was like water, it lasted, like, not even a minute. 
[00:07:30]  And then I felt so much better after that, that I was able to, well, usually the puke  helps you out.  Down a few potato chips.  Sure.  All right, let me, let's get this over with right here.  It's really quick and easy.  Jeremy in Cleveland.  Jeremy.  Hey, boys.  How's it going?  Well, we're starting to figure out what happened, uh, during the time we were off from radio.  Yes, a lot of shenanigans going on.  God, we got a whole list of shit to get to.  Yes!  Don't worry, we'll get into the Tiger Woods thing within minutes.  What happened?  That's a great, that's a great story. 
[00:08:00]  But first, Jeremy.  Go ahead, Jeremy.  Great news.  Maxwell is completely fired from Clear Channel and WMMS.  Fat boy is gone.  Fat boy is gone.  What happened to Maxwell?  Uh, you can't hear about that.  He couldn't agree to a very high six-figure contract and had too many ridiculous demands.  So the program director says, fuck you, see you later.  Eh, who knows?  I'd never trust anything radio executives say.  That's true.  I'd never happen to see a guy lose a gig.  I know we didn't get along with him, but I'd never happen to see a guy fired. 
[00:08:30]  I'd side with, uh, I'd side with Maxwell before I side with fucking management, so.  In this case, I'm extremely happy that Maxwell is fucking gone.  Cocky.  And punt.  Another hack that thought he could play with the big boys.  And then he's demanding too much shit in an environment that is pretty shaky as far as regular radio goes.  Yeah.  They don't even sell radio ads anymore.  You should, like, maybe look at the situation and realize, you know, hey, I might have to take some cutbacks. 
[00:09:00]  Right.  But, um, well, we could welcome him with open arms here on satellite radio.  He ain't going to be hired here.  Oh, please.  Why wouldn't he be?  Why wouldn't they?  I'll give him a multi-million dollar contract.  They'll probably build him a studio in his own house.  Yeah, exactly.  Nope.  I'll tell you why.  Because they don't hire radio guys.  They hire everybody else to do radio, but radio guys.  That's funny.  That's true.  Yeah.  Who are you kidding?  Yeah, I hear Denzel's getting his own channel.  Right. 
[00:09:30]  That's why, Anthony and Jimmy.  Yeah, welcome to my wig channel.  Yeah.  Just got signed.  We're telling stealing fan horror stories.  Tomorrow's show lifts.  Why would you actually hire guys that could do a radio show?  Yeah, yeah.  That's stupid.  Anyway, Tiger Woods, everyone.  That's a pretty big story in the news.  Tiger had a statement yesterday basically saying that all the rumors out there are complete bullshit. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, but then he said, it's my fault.  But he's not explaining nothing.  And, you know, he goes, I'm human.  Kind of, you know, eh.  This is a guy who's pretty much gone through his career without any scandal.  Unscathed.  Unscathed.  Yes, Jimmy.  And now we have some scathe.  Some.  I think there's a lot more to this than basically what we're all talking about.  I think there's still an atom bomb that's going to be dropped.  Now, here's the deal. 
[00:10:30]  He apparently, when the story first came out, he was driving away from his house.  He hit a fire hydrant and a tree and was injured in that accident.  Seriously injured.  Seriously.  The news report started with Tiger Woods seriously injured.  Like, he was in this massive car accident.  Yeah.  He's never going to play golf again.  He might not even survive the night.  I know.  That's how I read the first bulletin from this story.  Yeah, I assumed it was, you know, 70 mile an hour rollover on the freeway or something.  And Twitter and all these other social networking sites are bragging that they had the Tiger Woods news before CNN and the regular news outlets. 
[00:11:00]  And I'm sitting there like, that's great, but your fucking facts sucked.  It's wrong.  And then it started getting weird because they were showing the scene of the accident.  And then they go, that's Tiger Woods' house.  And you're like, how fast could he be going around this little circle?  Right, right.  You know, what's he doing, laps?  And then you realize, wait a minute, he crashed backing out of the driveway.  Yeah.  He backed out.  Into his neighbor's hydrant.  And then what, across the street or something?  And then he went forward. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, he went forward into a tree.  And then details started coming out that his wife was very heroic and broke the window of his truck so she could get him out.  And then things started getting a little weird with his injuries to his face.  Apparently he was scratched up.  Yep.  And whatnot.  And he was unconscious for a little while outside the vehicle.  I think they said he was unconscious for seven minutes.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:12:00]  That's...  Have you ever been knocked out?  I'm just saying.  Have you ever been knocked out?  Never really been knocked out.  It takes a few minutes to get your shit together.  Get your shit together.  So then it's starting to come out that perhaps him and his wife were arguing.  And he was leaving the premises.  During this time, she came out with a golf club and smashed the windows as he was driving away.  That was to get him out after the accident, Anthony. 
[00:12:30]  Everyone knows that.  Well...  Everyone knows that.  Then why were both sides broken?  There was the passenger and driver's side rear windows were busted with the golf club.  And apparently Tiger's head was also hit with the golf club.  You know?  Look, call it a hunch.  Yeah.  But I think Tiger was fleeing.  Yeah.  He was fleeing the scene.  And when the window broke, he apparently turned to look and see what the fuck the deal was.  Right.  And wasn't paying attention now to what's, you know, coming at him through the windshield. 
[00:13:00]  And it was a tree.  What a nerd.  Yeah.  To get an escalator.  You can't take out a golf club and a blonde lady?  Panicky piece.  What's the matter with you?  Just leave.  Just fucking leave.  So he hits that.  And then he's laying there on the ground.  I guess she dragged him out.  And apparently he was a little beat up.  Yeah.  And I'm wondering why he was kind of unconscious when the paramedics showed up.  I'll tell you why.  Four!  I'm starting to think.  Did she teed off on his head? 
[00:13:30]  Did she get one more shot in?  I think she might have gotten a shot in.  You think?  You motherfucker.  And it all started because I guess the National Enquirer, yeah, let me go to C.J. and George.  C.J.  Hey, yeah, boys.  I was watching college football all day when this happened.  First of all, they first reported that he had severe lacerations and he was in intensive care.  Right.  And within three or four hours, they reported there were minor scratches and bruises.  Yeah.  So, I mean, it's just an instance of the media trying to make a story.  The National Enquirer falsely reported that he was having an affair with some waitress. 
[00:14:00]  And the waitress is actually suing them because she never even made contact with Tiger Woods and she's got proof of that.  Is that why she got Gloria all right?  That's why I was wondering if she wants to sue.  Well, she's suing everyone.  But the National Enquirer is saying they got proof that the girl that announced that she had, you know, this other girl had the affair with Tiger Woods.  Wait, how can I explain this?  The girl that was supposedly having the affair with Tiger Woods said she'd never met Tiger Woods and she didn't know the person that reported the story to the National Enquirer. 
[00:14:30]  The National Enquirer is saying, no, we have proof that these two know each other.  Does that make sense?  Yeah.  Okay.  Let's put things into perspective.  I've also read a National Enquirer story that they found Goliath's skull and they had proof and it was an elephant's skull.  I mean, they're not fucking legible.  Yeah, I understand that.  They've also been right a lot, though, about stuff that people said no.  Yeah, celebrity stuff, man, it's very rare that they're wrong.  And when they are, they've got to pay through the nose.  So I think they kind of make sure and check a few facts. 
[00:15:00]  But why is Tiger keeping completely quiet as the whole world at this point is talking about this?  And look, here's a headline, come clean, Tiger.  Well, mum's the word.  Tiger Woods, come clean.  Mum's the word.  Because if it comes out that his wife had hit him, she will go to jail for domestic abuse.  It doesn't matter if he presses charges or not. 
[00:15:30]  Right.  You instantly go.  Also, the state trooper for Florida made an announcement that if it's a one-man accident or a one-car accident,  you're not required to have an interview or release a statement.  I mean, I just think Tiger has attracted the same women that Anthony is, crazy white bitches with problems.  Well, she didn't seem like she was a crazy bitch, though.  She just might be extremely upset if she found out that.  She's a little jealous.  Right, that Tiger might have had this affair.  And this is the girl that everybody was just like, oh, my God, did you see Tiger's chick? 
[00:16:00]  Oh, when they first hooked up?  Yep.  And then he what?  She had a few kids or something?  How many kids they got?  I think they got two.  Two kids?  She's still fucking hot.  Yeah, but you know what?  You know what happens to that vagina?  Jesus Christ.  What if she had this?  It's ravaged.  Maybe she had the C-section.  Yeah, even that.  You don't want to see that.  You don't want to look into that while you're fucking licking box.  Hey, Jimmy.  I want to see that.  Yes, sir.  Hey, Jimmy.  I'm right here.  We're having a serious conversation, sir. 
[00:16:30]  Did you have to do it there?  What type of childishness is this?  We're having an adult conversation about the Tiger Woods situation.  You know, we said when we come back from vacation, we're going to do a more mature show.  Exactly.  We don't want that type of childishness and the ribbing that we usually give.  What do you think, Jimmy, on this whole thing?  I think that probably he...  I'm always in the belief that the guy probably fucked the chick. 
[00:17:00]  It's hard not to...  I'd be amazed if he...  Look, if you're Tiger Woods and you're a faithful husband, I mean, you're just a better person than me.  Even if you're not a faithful husband, you're probably a better person than me.  I would be fucking in so much trouble so fast with that kind of ability to do it.  So, I don't know, man.  I have no idea.  And he told the troopers to go away for the third time yesterday?  Yeah, he's not talking.  Which keeps everybody else talking.  Well, yeah.  Even though it's none of our business?  He said it's a personal matter. 
[00:17:30]  But he's hinting with his statement that he's not perfect.  So, what does that mean?  Because he had a fender bender with a hydrant in the tree?  He's not perfect?  I interpret that as, I fucked some chick.  That's how I interpret I'm not perfect.  Yeah.  And, boy, that fucking girl got pissed.  Beat up on his Escalade, I think.  It's my hypothesis.  Beat up on him.  How insulting with a golf club.  Oh, I know.  How ironic.  I wonder, you know what?  I wonder if he... 
[00:18:00]  He paid for that mansion and that Escalade because of those golf clubs and now she's using  them.  And then he's getting beaten.  I wonder if he confessed to her.  You say what's my opinion?  I wonder if that's what caused that violent fight.  If he finally had to fucking go, look, this is what happened.  No way.  And then she went ballistic and scratched him and all that stuff.  Who was that?  Was that you saying you think he was actually leaving to go see the chicks?  No, no, no.  I thought that could be it.  That's crazy.  I didn't realize.  I didn't know the story had broken.  Oh, okay.  I think she attacked him while he was sleeping. 
[00:18:30]  That's a rude awakening.  Fuck.  Well, because I hear the face stuff was pretty impressive.  Yeah.  I don't want to say pretty bad because I haven't seen any pictures.  You think he's screaming, ah, and then he's screaming about her club selection.  You don't use a five iron on my...  What are you doing?  Because Tiger Woods, for the most part, all we know about the guy, he's pretty goody two-shoes.  Yes.  Why is he fleeing his house at two in the morning?  Where is he going?  Unless he's trying to get away from a situation.  Yeah.  What, is he going to get diapers?  Going to 7-Eleven? 
[00:19:00]  Where is he going?  On one of those free escalades that Caddy gives him for doing the fucking spots and shit.  Damn.  She should be accused of hate crime, Anthony.  Oh!  Well...  White on black crime.  Well, maybe that'll happen.  That's the only kind of hate crime they charge or report.  Might as well.  It doesn't exist the other way.  No, it certainly doesn't.  Oh, that's a good point.  Dan and Holbrook make a great point.  They're not fessing up because she wasn't using an approved Nike golf club and are afraid of the sponsorship suit. 
[00:19:30]  Ah.  That could happen.  Probably there wasn't a Nike logo across his forehead.  It was a Cleveland logo for you golf fans out there.  That would be great.  Just written backwards on his head.  Right.  Let's say hi to Jimmy James.  Morning.  I'm here CNN.  This story is everywhere today.  Woods wants privacy because now we're all past Thanksgiving and now we can all focus on what the fuck this story is all about. 
[00:20:00]  What do you got, Jimmy James?  Hey, I think Jimmy and Ant are both right that he indeed did fuck the chick and I think if his wife does not like it, she should take the $1 billion she brought to the relationship and go elsewhere.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure.  I can tell you something.  She would have a lottery.  Shut up and take it.  There's a lot of fucking money to be lost by Tiger, man.  Can they got two kids together?  Oh.  Even if there's a prenup, it means nothing when it comes to kids. 
[00:20:30]  That house, he ain't going to be there no more.  I've been following the story all weekend, too.  Who's this fucking friend that's talking?  Like, supposedly Tiger talked to a friend about the situation and then this friend turns around and is telling everybody.  Keep your mouth shut.  I guess he told a friend that he needs a Kobe special.  Thank you, Matt from Providence.  He needs the Kobe special, which basically means, I think it's described as a house on a ring.  That was it.  Remember that?  He needs to get a Kobe special. 
[00:21:00]  He supposedly told one of his friends.  And how good of a friend is this guy that he's running to the media?  That seems suspicious.  Guys are so dumb.  They just got to fucking yap.  You got to say, dude.  Guys don't yap.  I got to tell you.  No, no.  You got to yap about, like, you know, dude, I got to tell you I'm fucking this trailer for.  Yeah, but real friends don't yap.  They can tell each other.  I mean, but you don't yap to other people about it.  I'm saying the guy code, guys don't yap like broads do. 
[00:21:30]  Sorry, broads, but you guys yap too much.  When a guy tells another guy, you know, a top secret thing, for the most part, they don't say shit.  Yeah.  Women, though.  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.  Can't wait to get on the phone.  You know what I heard?  Right.  About Tiger.  Right.  And then fast forward, he's getting his fucking head teed off on.  Search warrant being sought in Tiger Woods' crash case.  Really?  It's just a domestic thing.  Who gives a shit?  They want his hospital records to see if his wounds are consistent with an accident or a beating. 
[00:22:00]  Wow.  I wonder if his wife lied.  That's why.  Huh?  I wonder if his wife lied to police.  Well, she completely changed the story.  I wonder if she got life in prison.  Yeah, let's say hi to Jim and Howard Beach.  What's up, Jim?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right, brother.  I watched Goodfell's, like, ten times this week, and they ran, like, a hundred freaking  times.  But it's kind of like in the movie one night, he probably came up with a golf club when he 
[00:22:30]  was sleeping.  He's got to get worried about getting whacked with a golf club out in the field.  Come on, Joe, Joe, coming home and getting whacked one in the face.  I come home to this.  Hey, probably most people have heard it by now, but what the hell?  It's the latest on Tiger Woods, the 911 call?  Yeah.  I didn't hear it.  It's the neighbor.  You got the neighbor calling 911 going, what the hell?  911 emergency.  I need an ambulance immediately.  I have someone down in front of my house.  They hit a pole. 
[00:23:00]  I came out to see if they were...  Is it a car accident, sir?  He's this one.  He's this.  Okay, sir.  Sir, is it a car accident?  Hello?  Hello?  Sir?  Why 911 calls are always so fucked up?  Hello?  Hello?  Yes?  Is it a car accident, sir?  I need a bandolette.  It's a car accident, yes.  I need you, yes.  Okay, and are they trapped inside of the vehicle?  No, they're laying on the ground.  Okay, stay on the line for medical. 
[00:23:30]  Don't hang up, okay?  I would love to be a 911 operator and get to the point, what happened?  And just as they start to explain, click.  Oh, yeah, that would be good.  So what happened?  Click part two of the 911 call.  What happened?  What's wrong?  I have a neighbor.  He hit the tree, and we came out here just to see what was going on.  I see him, and he's laying down.  You mean there was an auto accident?  Yes, there was an auto accident, yes.  Okay.  Is he outside or inside his car? 
[00:24:00]  Your phone broke up.  I heard inside.  You there?  Hello?  Hello, sir.  Are you there?  Your phone broke up there.  Okay, I got it.  Can you repeat your phone number for me in case you have the unconscious?  Yes.  Okay, are you able to tell if he's breathing?  No, I can't tell him right now.  Okay.  All right, we do have help on the way.  What color is this car, too?  It's a black disc leg.  What happened?  Is anyone able to open the door?  We're trying to figure out right now. 
[00:24:30]  Okay.  While I have paramedics on the way, I'm just going to stay on the phone with you.  If you find out further, just let me know.  I'm going to stay on the phone, okay?  What's the woman?  What's happening?  What's happened?  Tiger Woods, you're kidding.  Oh, God bless him.  Was that Susan Walden?  What happened?  Goodness gracious.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen, Tiger Woods got a driver in his head.  V.J. Singh was smiling. 
[00:25:00]  He knew.  And here it is, the first one of the day.  Kevin from Connecticut, because we were talking about this earlier, too.  How funny would it be if Tiger fucked Brooke Hunley?  Yes, Brooke Hunley.  Her stupid fucking lightsaber picture.  Greatest photo ever.  Is her holding that fucking weapon?  Like, in I'm going to shoot you pose?  Yes.  Fucking fat, awful body.  Oh, she had a blaster.  Oh, she yicky. 
[00:25:30]  Let's go to Matt in Buffalo.  Matt?  Hey, he's got to face the media before too long here.  He's got his golf tournament, doesn't he?  Yeah, he's got his golf tournament this week, I guess in L.A. or California somewhere.  It's his annual golf tournament that starts up, I think, tomorrow.  He's got to meet the media.  Well, you know what he's going to say.  He's going to go, it's a personal matter.  We're here for the golf and blah, blah, blah.  I'm not answering any questions.  Oh, really?  And the media will just turn and walk away.  Yeah, and they go, okay, Tiger.  Yeah. 
[00:26:00]  You got it.  Yeah.  There's going to be hundreds and hundreds of media outlets.  You got it.  Squeezing.  I guess Rogan was saying that this chick that he allegedly was banging hired Gloria Allred,  and she's talking to the news.  Well, she did hire a lawyer, and we're trying to figure out why.  Yeah, that's a...  And it's Gloria, who's kind of into the women's rights thing.  Yeah.  Ugh.  So.  I like the fact that you can use Joe Rogan as the source of all of his Tiger Woods information. 
[00:26:30]  Right.  What drug was Rogan on when he was fucking tweeting that?  What if I had a hallucination?  Really?  Then it was Tony the Tiger.  Right.  Hey, you guys are the best.  Welcome back.  All right.  All right.  That's true.  Rob on Long Island.  Rob.  Yeah, I mean, the guy's got a billion dollars, and I hear the neighbors speaking.  What's he living in Trenton?  What's he living in Trenton?  What's he living in Trenton?  Yeah, I know.  I thought that was a little odd. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, and we got some info coming in.  Thank God.  Get TMZ on the phone.  We got the ladies on the Tiger Woods thing.  Jared in Boston, what do you got?  La, la, la, la, rape.  Wow, that's a combo platter.  It certainly is.  What do you got, Jared?  I read it.  It said AP, so it must be true.  Okay, good.  They found the girl in the closet, so he was fling.  Oh, the girl was in the closet.  Wow.  Yeah.  Did she burn all his dog food?  Yes.  Sorry, sir. 
[00:27:30]  God, what a lot of references, that gentleman.  Didn't mean to interrupt the frunkus.  A lot of excitement there.  Let me say hi to Ziggy in D.C.  Ziggy.  Yeah, these are multi-million dollar homes in this neighborhood, and that guy can't afford  a better fucking cell phone.  Yeah.  Yeah, the cell phone was crap.  I just love that woman.  What happened?  What happened?  You think she was in her nightie?  Her nightgown?  Oh, yeah, she was in her nightie.  She was holding it up by her neck.  What happened?  It's time. 
[00:28:00]  With her overnight bad breath already seeping in.  Her teeth aren't even in.  Yeah, she could put her choppers in quick enough.  They're still in the water next to her bed.  All right, let's go to Jesse, Orlando.  Jesse.  Gentlemen, I think it's pretty simple.  I think that they got in a fight, and she beat the crap out of him, so to cover up what  happened, he went and crashed his car.  That's a little extreme.  Yeah, I don't think so.  Well, I mean, you're not going to crash into a fire hydrant as you're back out of your driveway, 
[00:28:30]  ever.  Even if you're drunk.  Exactly.  And why did he put...  And he's not...  And, you know, they're saying alcohol wasn't involved, but, I mean, come on.  He was in a panicked state.  Did the airbag go off?  No.  Oh, it didn't?  No.  He's doing one mile an hour.  Oh, because then OnStar might have had the audio to say, automatically alert you.  I mean, her story is that she knocked out the window to get him out of there, but come  on.  You could just open the door.  The door was fine.  The car's not even down the road yet. 
[00:29:00]  And why break both rear windows?  They're saying both now?  Oh, yeah, both sides.  I did not know that, Ann.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Let's say hi to Rich.  What's up, Rich?  Hey, I was just going to say that guy said about his charity tournament, he didn't even  go to it last year.  And so he definitely probably didn't go to it this year.  But y'all haven't even talked about how he's going to be able to survive since for the past 
[00:29:30]  10 years, he's only been able to make $100 million a year and $10 million a year on the  golf course.  And, you know, what's going to happen to him now with all this bad publicity?  You're right.  I think Tiger's finished.  Poor fella.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, this story obviously has freaking legs.  So we'll see what happens when we take a break, get into other things that happened over the  break. 
[00:30:00]  And we'll also continue with the Tiger Woods thing as more info becomes available.  All right.  Yes.  Anything else before we get a break here?  Yes.  This Morgan Freeman movie looks horrendous.  Which one?  Where he plays Invictus, where he plays Mandela and he doesn't sound like Mandela.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Boy, that's fucking, that's Clint Eastwood coming back from his last movie.  Like Clint Eastwood.  Oh, right, right.  That last movie where he played the racist guy. 
[00:30:30]  Yes.  And then he has to come back and make a Nelson Mandela movie.  All right, see?  I like the colored.  Matt Damon's voice sounds pretty, like his accent is pretty believable.  I just didn't like Mandela from what I saw in the previews.  It seems to, I mean, Freeman seemed annoying.  Anything unless he's got that monotone fucking, like he's reading a fucking dialogue.  I didn't even realize he was playing Mandela.  At first I didn't either.  That's how, I guess, how bad it is.  I've seen the preview a million times and never really put the whole thing together. 
[00:31:00]  What's that dumb accent he's doing?  Oh, him?  And who gives a shit?  Fucking leader somewhere over there.  Who cares about a fucking soccer team?  Yeah, I don't need to see good white people in South Africa.  There's fucking three of them.  You see any movies over the holiday?  Shit, no.  I wanted to.  Did I?  No, not a one.  I'm not going to see that fucking Twilight crap.  No, that's for fucking little teen girls.  Little girls.  Little tweens.  No.  Not a reason to go.  Let's not watch the movie. 
[00:31:30]  I'm not going to go.  Sniff the seats afterwards.  I'm not going to go see The Blind Side because Sandra Bullock is in it.  No, and that looks like another one of these.  Oh, look.  I'm not a fan of her and her plastic face.  Is she a plastic face?  She has a, it looks plastic.  I don't know what it is.  Yeah, it is.  I'm not a fan of her.  She's got those chiseled features.  I liked her in Speed, though.  But that's dating myself.  I liked her in Vanishing.  Is that a real movie, Jim?  Yes, with Jeff Bridges and Kiefer Sutherland.  It was a remake of a French film, I believe. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  All right, maybe I'll have to check it out.  Yeah, she disappears in the first ten minutes of it.  It's great.  Good.  Does 2012 had legs over the weekend?  Why?  People just like seeing destruction.  Yeah.  All right.  Old Dogs?  Oh.  It's a Disney movie, though.  Oh, but, no.  No, it's not.  I'm not even going to take that as an excuse.  I think what happens is, no, I think what happens is there's a big dog, and it grabs  Travolta's wig and runs with it.  And he's following it around, and he bumps lips with a man on a plane steps. 
[00:32:30]  That's what I think that movie's about.  Bumps lips.  Yes.  Him and another gentleman are looking for the wig that the dog is chewing on that Marmaduke  grabbed, and their lips bump for eight minutes as the fucking, as the plane doors are closing.  Is that the movie with Seth Green being held by the gorilla, and he has to sing, or the  gorilla's going to eat him or something?  Yeah.  Oh, I laugh and laugh when I see that scene.  It's hilarious.  Seth gets hit in the nuts with a golf ball, and...  Oh, just some very, very funny...  Another good one I'm sure he'd be proud of, that if I brought up the fact that he was 
[00:33:00]  in that movie, he'd talk about what he'd grossed and blah, blah, blah.  Oh, is that Seth Green?  Yes.  I've seen that 30 times and you realize it's like...  He got mad at us.  He got mad about that stupid upper river fucking...  No, what was it called?  Without a paddle.  Right.  We were having fun with the guy, so we're talking about, have you ever had a bomb or  something, and then we bring up that movie, he goes, ah, I'll have you know it made a  hundred million, or whatever he said.  Yeah, that kind of annoyed me that he was annoyed at that.  It's like, have some fun with it.  Yeah.  All right.  You made a fucking piece of shit movie.  You know it was a piece of shit movie. 
[00:33:30]  Gross.  You know, good for you that you were able to get some money out of it.  There's a picture of Robin standing behind Travolta, standing behind Seth, and you know  that Travolta just threw himself in there.  I bet they didn't even want him for the scene.  He just jumped in.  He goes, oh, I'll take the middle.  I want to be in this one.  I'll take the middle position.  Also known as the lucky devil position.  That'll look like Lemon Party.  Oh, let me say hi to Sharon Osborne, everybody.  Sharon Osborne.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  Hi, Sharon. 
[00:34:00]  I would just like to say that that young Tiger Woods fellow, he was blessed with the  gift of golf and beaten with a driving stick.  Oh, yes.  A driving stick.  You better apologize.  So you're not going to see Old Dog's Ant?  No.  Why would I see that?  And then A Christmas Carol.  Hasn't that movie been done enough?  Why does it have to be done again?  Jim Carrey's done, right?  Yeah, but great. 
[00:34:30]  There's a million versions of that movie out there already.  Enough with the Christmas Carol.  And, of course, then there's the black Disney movie that's coming out.  Oh.  The Frog Princess and the Frog thing.  Well, you know, I'd like to see some other movies kind of redone with white people in  the place of, like, black people.  Let's do, like, you know, Malcolm X with the white guy playing Malcolm X or something.  Why not?  Does that make sense?  Ted X. 
[00:35:00]  That makes sense.  It's a black, you know, princess in a castle in England somewhere back in the friggin' Victorian  times.  Yeah, sure.  It just seems, I don't know, it just seems forced.  Doesn't it?  It is forced.  It's the Obama thing.  I'm just going to say it.  It's the Obama thing.  The popularity, the whole black culture thing, they figured they'd capitalize on it by, look  at what we do now.  We make a black princess and a white prince or a black prince? 
[00:35:30]  Why don't they go all in with the black prince as well?  No, they got a bunch of black people in this one.  Black cartoon people.  But the white prince is the love interest, right?  Is it?  Looks like it.  I don't know how that works.  Look at that still I just saw.  Oh, she kissed the frog.  She turns into a frog instead of the frog turning into a prince.  That's the story.  That's what I got.  But walking around Disney, they got that black woman dressed like a princess shaking hands.  Is she fine?  Shortest line in the whole fucking park.  I swear to God.  Everybody's like, ooh, Mickey.  Ooh, this.  She's standing there going, could someone shake my hand? 
[00:36:00]  They don't know.  Can someone take a picture with me?  They don't know the black princess yet, though.  No, they don't.  Give it time.  Maybe that's it.  Mm-hmm.  And Walt Disney was not known for loving the brothers.  Let me tell you something.  The racist anti-Semite that Walt was.  You think he's rolling over in his grave right now?  Oh, is he spinning?  He's spinning like the carousel of progress, which you can see at Disney World.  Oh, he wants this frog arrested. 
[00:36:30]  For interspecies kissing.  Yes, exactly.  What?  Yeah, he wouldn't be happy, huh?  No, he wouldn't.  Oh.  Especially if they shove a Jew in there.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Is he really going to be angry?  Is Louis Black in today?  I think so.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We got Louis Black and Chris Russo coming in.  Chris Russo!  The mad dog himself.  Haven't I got to talk about a few things?  I'm sure the Nets record is going to come up.  What did I get?  Oh, it's 17?  What's happening with this team? 
[00:37:00]  Even after they let the coach go, they still lose another game.  Well, you see the guy that replaced the coach?  Yeah.  Well, what's the fat guy's story?  I don't know.  What, they just pick him out of the stands?  I think he cleans the bathrooms.  At the arena.  I don't know who that guy is.  You're fine.  All right.  We'll do the Nets thing.  It's really quick.  A few hours after head coach Lawrence Frank was fired, the Nets matched the worst start  to an NBA season with their 17th straight loss Sunday night in Los Angeles.  Wow.  The undermanned Nets fell behind by 27 points in the first half under temporary head coach 
[00:37:30]  Tom Barice.  With the loss, the Nets tied the mark set by the 1988-89 Miami Heat and the 1999 L.A. Clippers.  Brooke Lopez had 26 points and 12 rebounds for New Jersey, the NBA's lowest scoring and worst  shooting team.  The Nets are back home to play the Dallas Mavericks Wednesday night.  If they lose again, they will have sole possession of an embarrassing NBA record.  The NBA season just began.  Yeah.  And the Nets are pretty much officially out of it. 
[00:38:00]  Out of it.  Already.  What do you do if you're the Nets?  Do you just try to go for that record?  Oh my God.  I would lose every game.  Now just lose every game.  Oh my God, yeah.  Because, I mean, yeah.  Go down in history.  You would probably get fans to watch you lose every game.  Yeah, they lost again.  I mean, if all of a sudden they're 2-21.  Yeah, that's not as good.  But if they're 0-21.  Fantastic.  You're going to keep going in the games.  Yes.  That team is horrendous, by the way. 
[00:38:30]  I've watched a few highlights.  That team is horrendous.  Yeah.  Not a big basketball fan these days, but...  Yeah, I'm not at all.  But I'm keeping tabs.  See, I'm actually keeping tabs on the Nets and how badly they're losing.  See?  So it even got my interest.  But as soon as they win that first game, then it doesn't matter.  Then who gives a shit?  Then it's just a shitty team having a shitty season.  Right.  But now it's like, let's all talk about the Nets and see how many they can lose in a row.  All right, we'll do our first break. 
[00:39:00]  Get into some other things that happened over the break in a few minutes.  Opie and Anthony, good to be back.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Thanks for checking us out.  What's that app about?  You want to fucking share, my friend?  Oh, my God.  Looks like a good app for the iPhone.  Laszlo turned me on to this app.  It's just a bunch of frigging, like, chicks, naked.  They're apparently, like, you know, texts and whatnot. 
[00:39:30]  Look at that.  Good.  God.  Yeah, that's fucking nice.  What the fuck?  Yeah.  This is like tweet me some skin on Twitter.  Shit like that.  But it's, um...  You got the name of it here.  Basically, girls fucking taking pictures of their hot bodies.  It's Tweet Pro.  You know, T-W-I-P-R-O.  And, uh...  Yeah, somehow people intercept these things or get them and just post them on here and shit. 
[00:40:00]  And, uh...  If you go to all-time, uh...  Featured...  I mean, there are just some ridiculous...  What does all-time featured mean?  Like, in the search feature on the app?  Yeah, okay.  You go to all-time featured and it shows, like...  Which ones have been voted the best?  Those are the whole favors?  Yeah, those are the ones you're just getting, like...  They were put into the hall?  Insane fucking chicks.  We should have a Hall of Fame for hot...  Hot women.  And then there's...  With their busts.  Then there's some that are just texts, no pictures. 
[00:40:30]  And one said,  I can feel my heartbeat in my ass.  Like, someone must have gotten fucked in the ass so hard.  And then there's a lot of, uh, a lot of naked, uh, uh, girls frolicking.  Ooh.  A lot of frolicking.  See, here's some frolicking.  Jesus.  With some nude girls frolicking.  Don't you love frolicking girls?  I love frolic.  That's a...  Imagine guys frolicking like that.  No. 
[00:41:00]  No.  It's three girls in the bathtub.  They're, like, fucking open-mouth kissing.  They're totally naked, just pressed against each other.  And I bet you if you asked every one of those girls,  they would say, no, I'm not a lesbian.  No, no, no.  We're just frolicking.  We're friends.  We're friends.  That's what friends do.  We frolick.  We're just friends.  We're frolicking.  Now, get your best buds together  and try to do some naked frolicking with them.  Yeah, frolick with your pals.  See what happens.  Yeah, see if it gets on a line 
[00:41:30]  and everything's still cool  and you're, you know...  Stupid double standard.  I hate that it's a double standard.  Some naked chick in the back of a limo.  Yeah, that's a good app.  That was Laszlo.  That's the app of the year, I'm thinking.  Laszlo, no.  And Laszlo goes, he's talking to me and just says,  yeah, I just, you know,  find myself staring at these nude chicks on this thing  while my girl's trying to talk to me  and I'm just like...  She goes, what are you doing?  I just say, I'm looking at naked girls. 
[00:42:00]  I'm looking at asses.  I go, oh, okay.  That would be an easy cover-up.  Ah, you know, the freaking boss.  Got a little problem.  I'll be right with you.  You gotta be honest with the iPhone.  You know?  Yeah, you got apps.  You got fucking nudity on there.  What are you gonna say?  I'm just looking.  Well, we gotta get serious for a moment here.  The four police officers shot to death  at the Washington Coffeehouse.  For a moment, I got a little to say about this shit.  Of course you do.  Goddamn fucking animal. 
[00:42:30]  Now, the suspect had a 95-year prison sentence  commuted in 2000 by what?  A Hucklebee?  By a Huckabee.  Hucklebee.  I always call him Huckle.  Yeah, well...  Your old Hucklebee.  Yeah, Huckabee.  Huckabee.  I know he does.  Deciding his age, the convict's age,  thought it would be nice to let him out.  What are you talking about?  The recent picture, he looks like he's...  Yeah, exactly.  In his mid-40s, early 50s.  Well, apparently he was younger then  when Huckabee let him out. 
[00:43:00]  And didn't he just get...  The guy...  Some charges with...  Just...  Job molesting or something?  He's out on bail.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Slow down.  Yeah.  Because of his age, Huckabee got him out.  Yeah, because he was...  And how old was he?  He was 17 at the time.  So how many years ago is this?  Oh, 2000?  I think.  So he's 26 now?  That's it?  He looks like he's in his 40s.  I don't know.  Tough old life, I guess.  Wow, okay.  That's what I heard.  I don't know.  Yeah, I heard he was in his 30s.  I don't know what the fucking chronology is there.  Yeah, he's 37.  He's 37? 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, he was 17 in 1989.  Oh, in 89.  So then he spent some time in prison,  and then...  Oh, and Huckabee said...  Huckabee got him out.  He was 17 when he did all this.  Yeah, yeah.  He did his 11 years.  He should be out.  Okay, now he's got it.  He lets him out where he...  Summarily, rapes a child.  And then some judge, in his infinite wisdom,  thought, ah, we can let this guy out on bail.  So they let him out on bail,  and, well, there he goes. 
[00:44:00]  Kills four cops as they're...  Before their shift, having some coffee  and doing some paperwork.  And just walks in.  By the way, black guy shoots four white cops.  Just, I just want to say it,  because other people don't really seem to think  that's an important part of the story.  I do.  Yeah, shot him.  Dead.  He might have been hit.  They're not sure, but they're looking for him.  This guy, how he...  I think Huckabee and the judges 
[00:44:30]  that have fucking let this guy slide  should all have to go to the fucking...  the funerals for these cops  and look their families in the eye and say,  well, yeah, yeah, I let him out.  And yeah, I was the one that let him out on bail.  Uh, why was this guy out on bail  after, uh, um, being arrested on raping a child?  Because he wanted that beauty mark removed?  Yeah, maybe.  He's got an Aaron Neville thing growing there. 
[00:45:00]  That's a good identification mark, though.  I'll tell you that one.  So they're, uh, apparently still looking for this guy.  No, this...  In the house, they said.  Yeah, no, they might have him in the house, right?  Yeah, this morning they got some kind of house, uh...  And they set up loudspeakers and they're talking,  but they haven't heard anything yet.  They're throwing some explosives into the house.  A few flashbangs?  I think so.  I love the flashbangs.  And, you know...  Wasn't she...  Hold the duty.  Wasn't she an Asian stripper?  Flashbang? 
[00:45:30]  Flashbang! Flashbang! Flashbang!  Flashbang!  Sorry.  It's just a, uh...  Yeah, I...  I think this completely ends any chance  of Huckabee running for president.  Is he Democrat or Republican?  Republican.  Republican, yeah.  Uh, but he's been criticized before  for commuting so many fucking sentences.  This guy just lets these people go.  I don't understand it.  And even the prosecutor,  uh, I believe it was in Arkansas, right?  I believe it was from Arkansas. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, I think it was in Arkansas at the time.  Uh, even the prosecutor said,  this is the nightmare I've been waiting for.  He goes, this is the nightmare  when I heard that they were letting this guy go.  And he protested it.  The prosecutor was like,  what are you talking about?  So he's on record?  He's on record protesting.  Oh, yeah.  And the guy, the guy said, he goes,  this, I was, I knew this would happen with this guy.  He's been a problem.  This guy is a fucking problem.  And he walked in,  walked past the cops,  went to the counter,  ordered something to drink, 
[00:46:30]  pulled a gun out,  just shot, uh,  two of them,  who died immediately.  Uh, one of the other cops went to stand up,  shot him,  and, uh,  then, uh,  the fourth cop actually got on his feet  and started coming after him,  might have gotten off a shot,  and he wound up dying,  he wound up dying at the door.  They're all wearing vests,  which is odd,  especially with the last guy, like...  Well, they're sitting there,  so he probably,  the first we probably did headshots on him,  but he was sitting there.  That's what I'm thinking.  It's your target.  You know, 
[00:47:00]  but then,  especially the guy that he had the scuffle with,  um,  that's kind of odd,  a headshot, like,  as you're scuffling with somebody like that.  What do you mean a scuffle?  They got,  they touched each other?  Yeah, I think there was physical contact  between the two,  is what, uh,  what I was reading last night, so...  Maybe the cop charged him,  and he already had his pistol out  and just shot down him.  It might have, yeah.  Well, there's,  there's still, you know,  going over all that,  but, uh,  oh my God,  just fucking despicable.  Yep.  Uh,  all in uniform,  uh,  all marked cars outside, 
[00:47:30]  so,  and nobody else,  even had the gun pointed at them  by this guy.  He went in  with the purpose  of shooting police officers.  That,  that was it.  Unbelievable.  Who shoots four fucking cops sitting there?  Why do you even take that chance?  The odds are  you're going to be shot doing that.  A fucking,  a fucking animal does that.  That's what it does.  Tell someone that's not thinking of consequences.  They just,  somebody filled with hatred,  uh,  uh,  uh,  with,  with,  um,  no respect for life, 
[00:48:00]  um,  the laws of,  of our,  our land,  um,  and just somebody who,  who does not need to be breathing,  uh,  the same air as,  uh,  the rest of this country.  Um,  this guy has obviously been treated with kid gloves  from his early,  uh,  time in prison.  And,  uh,  just the fact that Huckabee let him out.  How does that,  I'd love to know how that makes him,  I'd love to ask Huckabee,  how does that,  do you feel any responsibility for this?  I'd love to ask him, 
[00:48:30]  do you feel  any responsibility  for four cops  being dead?  Uh,  fathers,  a mother,  uh,  do you feel any responsibility,  any remorse  for,  for,  uh,  obviously making a huge mistake  in thinking this guy could be,  uh,  a member of society.  Four cops would be alive  if he hadn't,  you can't deny  that your action  directly caused the death  of four cops.  Exactly.  I don't care what semantics 
[00:49:00]  he's gonna use,  how he's gonna try to spin it,  or anything,  he let a fucking criminal go  that does not deserve  to,  to,  to be out of prison.  Uh,  for what reasons?  I have no fucking idea.  Why?  Because he was 17  when he was a,  a violent criminal?  What was he convicted of  when he was in jail?  Have you got a 90-something  year sentence?  Aggravated, uh,  robbery, uh,  and assault.  And, um,  yeah,  a 93-year sentence.  That guy must have  really done something.  I,  I'd love to know  the details of that one. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah,  you know,  commuter guy doing 93,  you did something  really fucking awful,  probably,  if you're in jail that long.  Yeah.  Oh,  is that a Huckabee statement?  Oh,  he's got a statement  on this already?  What does it say?  I can't,  I can't,  I can't,  that's a long fucking statement.  The senseless and savage  execution of police officers  in Washington State  has saddened the nation,  and early reports  indicate the person of interest  is a repeat offender  who once lived in Arkansas  and was wanted  on outstanding warrants  here in Washington State.  The murder of any individual 
[00:50:00]  is a profound tragedy,  but the murder of police officers,  um,  meh,  an assault on every citizen  and the laws we live within.  Should he be found  to be responsible  for this horrible tragedy,  it will be  the result  of a series of failures  in the criminal justice system  in both Arkansas  and Washington.  He was recommended  for and received  a,  a,  a,  a,  a,  a,  a commu,  yeah,  you know. 
[00:50:30]  Commutation?  Yeah,  letting out  of the original sentence  from 1990.  The commutation  made him parole eligible  and he was then,  um,  paroled by the parole board.  Once they determined,  see,  he's not,  he's not taking responsibility  for this.  He's the one  that commuted his sentence.  He commuted it  to a parolable sentence,  right?  Yes.  So he's basically saying,  I commuted it  to a parolable thing, 
[00:51:00]  but they're the ones  who thought he was fit  to be let out.  You're right,  he is trying to fucking  pass in the book.  Yes,  yes.  Does he say I,  it appears that he has,  uh,  continued to have a string  of criminal  and psychotic behavior,  but was not convicted,  uh,  oh,  but was not,  I kept incarcerated.  Sorry,  but you just state  this very small print.  Uh,  this is a horrible,  tragic event.  If found and convicted,  the offender should be  held accountable 
[00:51:30]  to the fullest extent  of the law.  That's a tough words.  Our thoughts and prayers  are blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Full extent of the law.  You know something?  They had the full extent  of the law.  They had them.  And then the child rape charge.  You know,  what about that?  Where's the judge  that let this guy  fucking out on bail?  After raping a child?  After raping a child.  What the fuck is going on out there?  Where's that despicable  motherfucker  that should not be  on the bench?  It's one of these  just horrible things  that were completely avoidable. 
[00:52:00]  Let me go in.  Completely avoidable.  Let's go to Wisconsin.  Tim.  Yeah.  It kind of dawned on me  that he was going up  for that child rape charge  and those guys  having a notoriously  hard time in prison.  He might have shot  them cops just,  you know,  getting some favor  when he gets in there  because you know  what they say.  You're a pederast.  You shoot poor cops,  you're a spook hero.  Nah, but to, uh,  Jesus.  The, uh,  the, uh,  he's probably,  that sounds to me  more like a suicide  attempt in a way.  Like we are,  they call it suicide 
[00:52:30]  by gun or suicide  by cop or whatever.  I forget what it's called.  No fucking way.  Not the way he did it.  Then you shoot three of them  and then one.  How about you leave  one alive to kill you?  Because I don't think  that you're actually  saying to yourself  even that you're  going to kill yourself.  Like,  yeah, maybe you're right.  I mean.  I don't know.  Why else would you  shoot four guys  with guns?  I mean.  Suicide by cop usually  is a guy rushing  at cops with a gun,  a weapon,  and then they get shot.  It's,  it's rarely shooting  the cops,  especially all of them  like that.  And they said it was, 
[00:53:00]  it came off  as an execution,  as an ambush.  This guy walked in,  uh,  apparently the person  behind the counter  saw a gun  in his waistband,  um,  and ran into the back room.  Right away.  Right away, yeah.  Thinking it was  going to be a robbery.  Right.  Uh,  then he just turned around  and fired at the cops  that were sitting there.  And, uh,  yeah,  it's,  what kind of gun was it?  It's despicable.  They're not saying.  I haven't heard yet.  Legal or illegal?  It has to be illegal.  He's a fucking 
[00:53:30]  convicted felon.  There you go.  Illegal.  Illegal.  And the gun  didn't fucking  walk into the store  and shoot the cops.  He fucking did it.  He held it.  It's like a fucking car,  uh,  smashing into a crowd  of people.  It's, you know,  not the Ford's,  it's not the Ford's fault.  Let's go to Rick  in Rockland.  Rick?  Uh,  good morning,  boys.  I find the funny thing  about this is  I've been around the dial,  uh,  but you're the only show  that's talking about this  this morning.  I haven't listened to  Hyman's yet,  but you know what?  You're the only guys  that are going to be 
[00:54:00]  making a big stink about this.  It's just going to be  swept under the carpet  like it always fucking is  and it's absolute  fucking horse shit.  And,  what is this country  coming to?  George Carlson said it.  He was on your show.  He said,  the end is near  and some of us  are going to be around  to see it.  I'll tell you what  it's coming to.  Fuck,  George did say that  over a year ago  and man,  if you've been following  the stock market  and everything,  the Dubai situation  and the Chinese  and everything else,  yeah,  the end is near.  We're getting close to that. 
[00:54:30]  This is how stupid we are.  The Daily News front page,  they're the same as the Post.  Oh, I know.  Tiger Woods and his wife  and these four cops  being executed.  I mean,  the Daily News,  I was surprised  they actually listed  the race of the suspect.  That's a miracle  that the Daily News did that.  Yeah, I know.  I'm trying to find...  You see,  Tiger Woods,  Tiger Woods is a fucking story.  The guy,  I don't want to accuse the guy,  but it kind of looks like  he got caught running around  on his wife  and his wife busted  in his window  because he caught him.  You know,  to be a complete  conspiracy theorist 
[00:55:00]  with her might paint.  But, you know,  the ridiculous part is  that's a front page story,  but four cops are dead.  I know.  That doesn't bother  the shit out of me.  And, by the way,  CNN, MSNBC,  a lot of the liberal media outlets  did not announce  that suspect's race  for quite a while  until it became obvious  and that they had to  because they were looking  for a person.  The police put out  a description. 
[00:55:30]  Black man,  scraggly beard,  approximately, you know,  5'11 to 6'1".  Like, it was a description.  They are looking for this man  that shot four police officers.  They had to announce his race.  They didn't want to.  A lot of times,  the media will wait  until they have a...  Hold on, bro.  A lot of times,  the media waits  until they have a photo  so they don't have to say it.  Exactly.  They can just show.  Show the picture.  The thing is...  Where's Al Sharpton  or where's Jesse Jackson?  You won't see them.  Where are they?  They're probably rushing 
[00:56:00]  to this young man's aid.  Yeah, exactly.  And that's another thing.  If, for some reason,  one of the officers  would have seen this gentleman  with a gun in his waistband  or whatever  and confronted him  and questioned him  and perhaps had to shoot him,  there would be an investigation.  Four white cops  shoot a black man.  I mean,  it's getting to the point...  I was reading a lot of stuff  last night  about the Los Angeles Police Department  and how the LAPD  are afraid.  They are petrified 
[00:56:30]  of confronting black people.  That's why the gangs  are running rampant  in Los Angeles.  They are afraid  to confront them  because they will  be brought to justice  if they make a mistake,  if they question someone  a little too vigorously,  if they are appearing  as if they're profiling.  So you know what they do?  They ignore shit.  They leave it alone.  People in L.A.  are scared shitless.  Hey, you don't want  to fuck with your job.  No.  Why would you?  Why fucking jeopardize...  Why would you fuck with your job? 
[00:57:00]  Not only fuck with your job,  maybe go to jail.  Right.  Fuck you.  I'm walking away.  I'm looking the other way.  Right.  Fuck it.  Amazing.  Something's got to be done.  It's really getting bad.  Also, just throw this  into the mix.  We have eight TVs on.  All of them.  Just all over  the Tiger Woods story.  I mean, every 15 minutes  they're trying to do an update  on something that doesn't  have an update.  And I haven't seen  any coverage on this.  In fairness,  I've seen them a few times.  I've seen them a few times.  I haven't seen it yet.  And this is something else 
[00:57:30]  I want to bring up.  Well, the point is  nothing like with the Tiger Woods.  No, no.  Tiger Woods is all over the place.  This is something  I want to bring up.  If you look in recent history,  we got the Fort Hood shooting.  And then we have  the Seattle shooting  that happened.  An officer was killed.  That suspect is in the hospital.  And we have this gentleman now  shooting four cops.  Um, where is this dangerous  right-wing militia types 
[00:58:00]  that the Democrats  were talking about  that are just going to be  spreading violence  and they're the ones  that everyone's going,  oh, look out.  Watch out for those  right-wing militia people.  Meanwhile,  I don't think these are  right-wing militia people  that are executing  police officers.  And other soldiers.  Right, right.  And other soldiers.  They're not right-wing  extremist militia,  uh, uh, you know,  that are concerned  about our borders,  uh, concerned about, uh, 
[00:58:30]  crime, concerned about  the government intrusion  into our lives.  These are fanatical Muslims.  They're, um, angry, racist,  hateful black people  that, uh, just, uh,  I have no idea.  This guy obviously  has a problem  with, uh, uh,  of the police.  Mm-hmm.  I mean, I mean,  I'm not going on a limb there.  And, um,  it's got to be addressed.  It's got to fucking  be addressed.  Well, let's say hi  to Pete in Florida.  Pete.  Yeah, I know where  Al and Jesse  and all the rest of them are. 
[00:59:00]  They're freaking  arranging this surrender,  this poor,  un, you know,  misunderstood blackmail  so that the cops  don't ambush him  and kill him  when they bring him in.  Oh, this guy  should just be brought  in fucking  dead,  shot to fucking,  riddled with bullets,  and put on a stick.  Hopefully he shot himself.  Put on a fucking stick  tied by his ankles  and his arms  as they fucking  bring him in.  Hopefully he shot himself.  Hopefully.  I want to see the cops  open up on this motherfucker.  Yeah, I'd rather see 
[00:59:30]  a lot of wholesome cops.  I would love to see  the cops open up  on this motherfucker.  Uh, uh,  I don't know,  I would love to see him  wanting to live  and having that, uh,  taken away from him.  Nah, because then  there's more money  wasted on investigations.  And what,  did they shoot the young man  when he had his gun  pointed down?  Just put a bullet  in your own head  and it's over.  Let's go, David,  in Baton Rouge.  David?  Yeah, morning, guys.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hi, David.  Uh, I want to just  point out how effective  the, uh,  the gun laws are  in this case.  Wasn't this guy  a convicted felon?  Yeah, with all the gun, 
[01:00:00]  yeah.  Get a gun.  With all the gun control laws,  uh, I think this guy  should have paid attention  to all the laws  that are put in place  for law-abiding citizens  that, uh, you know,  everybody's got to jump  through a hoof  to defend themselves.  And, uh, how he got one.  Did he fill out  the forms properly?  I wonder if he did that.  Did he wait six months  to get his license?  Did he, uh, you know,  did he, uh,  was he fingerprinted  and interviewed?  Uh, did he put down  references, uh,  for his, uh, license  before he then made  a handgun purchase? 
[01:00:30]  Oh, dude,  this has to be  an illegal gun, though.  He probably didn't do  any of this stuff.  Oh, liberal Jim!  Yeah, yeah,  keep legislating  against the people  that might have been  able to do something  in the fucking, uh,  uh, uh, diner.  Ah, I'm sick of it.  Fucking idiots.  You should open up, uh,  a window.  Yeah, what?  You're mad as hell.  And I'm not gonna  take it anymore.  There's a window  right over there.  Why don't you do it?  Right now.  Start it up.  There it goes.  I'm mad as hell  and I'm not gonna 
[01:01:00]  take it anymore!  What a kook.  Dollar buys a nickels  for the shopkeeper  keeps a gun under the...  That's one of the best  fucking monologues ever.  Yeah.  He walks in  out of the rain  and just sits there  fucking with his raincoat on.  Howard Beal.  That fucking psycho.  I know, that's fucking great.  I think the movie  Network,  I think it,  I think it,  it holds up.  I think it does.  Because the foreshadowing  into reality TV  is brilliant.  If you haven't seen Network,  you gotta understand  that when that movie  was made, 
[01:01:30]  there was in CNN,  there was only, what,  three, four channels  that we were checking out  on TV,  and there was a lot  of foreshadowing  in that movie,  which, uh,  you gotta understand.  It was brilliant.  Or you're like,  what's the big deal?  No, they were talking  about stuff that  hasn't happened yet.  Reality TV  and, and, and,  and, uh,  everything else.  And, uh, yeah,  and, uh, uh,  what's her name?  Oh, my God.  Jessica?  No, uh, uh, yes.  They don't know what  plays this heartless  TV executive,  this woman,  and, uh,  they're following  the Sim,  Symbian, uh,  liberation group 
[01:02:00]  or something,  these, like,  like local terrorists  or whatever,  and, uh,  the reality show  is just filming them,  and it just shows  how, like,  instead of doing  something,  we're just filming  and documenting  what they're doing,  and it's,  it's amazing  that that's what's  going on now.  Well, not with terrorists,  but, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, him and his raincoat  just soaked from the rain.  Dude, he's fucking,  Peter Finch,  he died right after that.  He won the Oscar.  He was fucking unbelievable.  He died right after that?  I believe so, yeah.  Uh, let's go to Mike in Jersey.  Mikey.  Hey, good morning, fellas.  Good morning.  Mike?  Hey, last,  last week, uh, 
[01:02:30]  I saw on CNN.com  and AOL.com,  they all covered it,  some funeral,  so for some, uh,  black teenager in New York  that was shot  by two white cops.  He was armed.  He pointed a gun at them.  Um, but they did  the coverage of the funeral,  um, and also compared it  to, uh, the Diallo shooting  and the Bell shooting,  they had to make sure  they had to put that  in the story  about, you know,  the past,  how New York City cops  just shoot up black people.  Um, and that was  all over the news  and now this is  tucked in the back  and they also made sure 
[01:03:00]  they went out  how many shots they fired,  which they hit them  like nine out of  16 shots,  which isn't bad.  Um, but, uh,  when you've got  a few people shooting.  They have to fucking  cover that, you know,  uh, with a black,  young black male  getting killed.  Um, and of course  that'll be all over the news,  but, uh,  it's just an odd thing  and, and, and believe me,  I've seen calls come up here.  I, I understand white people  are committing crimes,  uh, against the police,  against, uh, uh, society,  society, everything.  You know, I'm not just saying  that I'm not just, 
[01:03:30]  uh, I'm, I'm talking about  the disproportionate number,  uh, that goes on  in the black community  and something's got to be done.  Somebody else was asking,  I agree, Anthony,  but what can we do about it?  The only thing you could  really do about it  is talk open and honestly  and bring this shit up  when, when it happens  and, uh, you know,  uh, uh, uh,  make people aware  that there is a problem,  that race-baiting shitheads  like Reverend Al Sharpton  and Jesse Jackson  perpetuate stuff like this  by vilifying, uh, uh, uh, 
[01:04:00]  the police  and, um, uh,  stirring shit up.  Uh, and it's, uh,  it's just something  that'll continue until,  I think until people  are willing to speak openly  and honestly  without the worry  that they're going to be  called a racist.  That's what it is.  I don't give a fuck  if someone calls me a racist.  Obviously.  Obviously.  I know.  But, but it's true.  It doesn't bother me.  I know, I know,  in my heart,  I know I'm not. 
[01:04:30]  I know I'm not  a fucking racist.  Uh, I, I,  I have ideas  ideas and opinions  that are based on  what I've learned  throughout my life.  Um, that's,  that's the only thing  you can know.  What you've learned  during your life.  And I base my opinions  on that.  Uh, if someone wants  to call me racist for it,  go fuck yourself.  I'm not, I'm,  I'm honestly,  someone, I don't see  myself as racist.  I mean, everyone.  Everyone.  Yeah.  Uh, but it's,  it's, but it's true. 
[01:05:00]  Just speak openly.  Don't worry about people  fucking calling you out  as being a racist.  That's the cheapest  fucking easiest way out.  Yep.  When somebody's confronted  with facts, uh,  that are, are, uh,  about something racial,  uh, is, is calling you  a racist because it  shuts the whole argument  down.  And when it happened,  now you, now you go  on the, I'm sorry,  you go on the defensive  now.  Now you've been put  on the defensive  to try to explain  why you're not a racist  and the whole,  the whole conversation  changes. 
[01:05:30]  So fuck it.  Say, all right,  you believe I'm a racist?  Yeah, okay, fine.  Blah, blah,  and now here,  I'm going to continue  my argument.  And the media,  this is what's so  despicable about the way  that it's covered,  is they, they never  exonerate a guy  who's accused of being  racist, a white guy  who's accused of being  racist.  They jump on  and they act like  they're just, uh,  bystanders,  but a bystander,  all they're doing  is filming the  accusations and people  say, well, I think  they are, and fueling  the fire.  They're such bags of  shit.  They never actually  will come around  and go, oh, no, 
[01:06:00]  this person isn't a  racist and show  evidence that they're not.  Yeah, it's a pack dog  mentality.  Yep.  I love saying that.  Yeah, I like it too.  Because it's true.  All right, why don't we  take a quick break  and change gears?  I need to eat.  It's eating time.  Where's my sandwich?  And I want to discuss,  I tweeted something  that people were saying  I was wrong about,  but I wasn't.  All right, we'll do  that next.  I wasn't wrong.  That's a nice little  tease right there.  I was right and I  knew it.  We'll find out what  that's about. 
[01:06:30]  Also, let's not forget  Mad Dog, Chris Russo,  in studio today.  He canceled.  Oh, that's all right.  I just wanted to sound  like I...  That was good.  Did you believe it?  Because I wasn't  looking at your face,  but your delivery was  very good.  I hope you didn't  believe me.  I think you'd be good  on the radio.  Funny, you can use  this one, but they  tell me I've got a  face for radio.  Oh, good gravy.  There was something  I read on a Google  alert that said,  and frequent guest  on the Opie and  Anthony show, Jim  Norton. 
[01:07:00]  Every day I get  booked.  I know.  It's not a lot.  My frequent guest.  Yes, it's Jim again.  He has something to  promote.  Can he come in 2007  to 2009?  Yes, Jim Norton's  been clamoring to  come in again.  Does it work?  Monday, Tuesday,  Wednesday, Thursday.  Friday, Monday,  Tuesday, Wednesday,  Thursday.  Saturday and Sunday,  he doesn't need.  Monday, Tuesday,  Wednesday, Thursday.  I'll be out every  Monday.  Monday-Friday. 
[01:07:30]  Monday-Friday.  Also, Louis Black  at 10 o'clock today.  Yeah, I saw something  to Louis that made me  laugh.  It was this thing  about surviving the  holidays.  It was actually  pretty funny.  I'm going to say  I was surprised.  I just didn't know  it was on.  We should plug  Louis C.K.'s video  too.  Yes, we should.  I don't know where  you can find it.  Probably on YouTube.  It's fucking hilarious.  Supposedly, he's  stopping in.  I'm doing Caroline's  Thursday through Sunday.  He's stopping in.  What?  To the show or  you're Caroline's?  Just made that up  to get the plug out. 
[01:08:00]  Motherfucker.  Hit that goddamn  break.  Fuck.  Fuck.  I was trying to tweet  the Louis C.K.  link for everybody  because the video  is hilarious.  I fucked up.  I'll try it again  during the next break.  Sorry.  Damn.  Damn Twitter.  Or my fingers.  Tweets.  Tweets.  People thought I was  I was thinking of tweets. 
[01:08:30]  Yes, Jimmy.  I was not wrong  about one of my tweets  and I resent the  implication  that I may have been.  What happened?  Let me just  I'll give you the exact  tweet.  I just want to correct  people.  It was  here it is  from last night.  Cabo Wabo  another monumental  dud by Van Halen.  Jesus, they have  some terrible songs.  I was listening to it  on the Boneyard  and then somebody  tweeted back  that it was Sammy 
[01:09:00]  Hagar's solo  not Van Halen.  Okay.  Well, it was indeed  Van Halen.  So stop letting  that fucking  overrated band  off the hook.  Wow.  Overrated.  Jimmy.  Is this Cabo Wabo?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Nice.  Go.  Go, man, go.  Go, man, go.  Right.  Wow.  That's a linger longer.  Oh, shit. 
[01:09:30]  Around the world.  Stretching  every corner.  You know, he can't  drive 55s  no matter how bad  he tries.  You know, if you  back that up a little  bit, it sounds like  he's trying to come up  with the lyrics on  the spot.  Yeah, it really  does.  Cabo Wabo.  Wow.  That's horror  Wabo. 
[01:10:00]  Not a fan of  Van Halen in  general, Jimmy.  I like some of  their stuff, but I  just think they're  extraordinarily overrated.  They had a good  run.  What are some great  Van Halen songs?  Tell me great  Van Halen songs.  I'm not saying they  don't have any good  songs.  I don't think they  hold up now, but  at the time, you  get things like  Running with the  Devil was huge.  It was a huge song.  What is it?  Crying?  Yeah.  Exactly.  Jamie's crying.  But it was also 
[01:10:30]  about, you know,  Eddie's guitar playing  was kind of like no  one had really  exemplary played  like that.  Yes, great  guitarist.  You know, he kind  of added that in.  I don't know.  Yeah, their later  albums started  sucking.  I think even their  old stuff is  overrated.  This song is  fucking terrible.  This is, uh, yeah,  this isn't good.  This is awful.  How about when  eagles fly?  I don't know that  one.  Hot for Teachers,  okay. 
[01:11:00]  I mean, there's some  good stuff, but  holy shit, enough  already with this  thing.  Oh, and the  Cradle Will Rock,  of course.  Oh, I don't know  that one.  Unchained.  Yeah.  Right around the  time of Hot for  Teachers when they  lost me.  Yeah, I mean,  Hot for Teachers was  a pretty good song,  but what else was  on that album?  They all, I think  they just tried so  hard to be, um,  to pay more  attention to what  their videos were  than the music.  Like, David Lee  Roth had to be the  wild, outrageous, 
[01:11:30]  ooh, look at me.  Yeah.  All right, we get  it.  Ooh.  This song is  unbearable.  Yeah, this song  stinks.  I don't even know  what they're talking  about.  Thanks.  Oh, it's just  fucking terrible.  There was another  one I had recently  I tweeted, too.  It was unbelievable.  It was like a parody  of a bad song that  Van Halen did.  It's like the  Boneyard, it was my  favorite station  anywhere.  But God, they play  some horrendous Van  Halen songs.  Sammy Hagar. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, I am not.  Not?  Here it is.  Drop Dead Legs.  Not when he was with  Van Halen as much.  Drop Dead Legs.  I did this one last  week.  Why Van Halen is  playing?  What a god-awful  fucking song.  It's like the audio  version of my spoiled  milk farts.  I was fucking  farting horribly.  People saying  best song Van Halen  ever did was  We're Back and  Better Than Ever.  Without a doubt.  We hear that  probably.  Long, long, long,  long time.  Yeah, yeah.  But this is,  just listen to this  from Drop Dead  Legs.  Yeah, I know, 
[01:12:30]  Drop Dead Legs.  Is this Roth or  Hagar?  I don't remember.  That's a very good  question.  I said I know the  song, now I'm not  sure.  I think I just  heard of Hagar.  I just don't  remember.  Dave.  That's Dave.  That's Dave, yeah.  Dave.  Speaking of the  Boneyard, how's your  boy Ronnie James  Dio doing?  Oh, fuck, man.  Yeah, Dio.  I saw that come  over the wire  during our break.  Diagnosed with  stomach cancer, man,  which is 67. 
[01:13:00]  But they said they  caught it in the  early stages.  Like, stomach cancer  to me is fucking  horrifying.  Sounds like a  motherfucker.  Awful.  How do you live  without your stomach?  Dude, it's just,  I hope they got it  really early, but  he's an older guy,  man, so.  Yeah.  Is he really 67?  Yeah, he's held  up amazingly well.  He's 67?  And he's still  fucking touring  with Heaven and Hell  and Solo.  He's an animal.  He's a fucking  animal.  So I hope he's  all right, man,  because that just  stinks.  He's a sweet guy,  too.  Got a lot of  angry Van Halen  fans out there.  Look, Van Halen's  a massive band. 
[01:13:30]  I'm not saying  they're not.  I just don't like  them.  Travis, only Van  Halen phone calls  right now.  Get rid of everyone  else for me.  Jim in New York.  No, actually,  Josh in Cleveland.  Sorry, Jim.  Josh.  Hey there, Josh.  Hey, morning, boys.  Welcome back.  Hey, I think it  might have been my  tweet that Jimmy  read, but if it is,  I wasn't saying  it was Van Hagar,  Solo.  It's Van Hagar,  which I know is  such a cheesy  fucking term, but.  No, no, I got  that one.  I mean, there was  someone that said  that was him solo,  too.  Oh, well, they're  a fucking moron  then, but, uh.  Listen, this is  Dave, though.  Drop Dead Legs. 
[01:14:00]  This is heinous.  It's fucking  terrible.  This is a terrible  fucking song.  He's talking about legs,  that he likes.  Yeah, what's wrong  with legs, Jimmy?  Drop Dead Legs.  Yeah.  Yeah, McCartney  should be singing  this.  Drop Dead Legs.  Again, I don't 
[01:14:30]  doubt their popularity.  I'm not saying  Van Halen doesn't  have fans.  They're huge.  I just think  they fucking stink.  If you're like  sitting here, guys,  you should check out  Chicken Foot.  It's pretty good  doing that.  Chicken Foot's  getting a lot of  promotions.  I was telling you  before the show  today.  Yeah.  I was at Best Buy  and there's  Chicken Foot shit  all over the place.  I downloaded it.  But that's the  only place where  it really is.  Oh, really?  I think they have  some kind of deal  with Best Buy.  That's the only  place I've ever seen.  I love how Dave  goes, that's the  only place it is.  It's Best Buy.  It's Best Buy.  That's a pretty  impressive place to be.  Yeah, but I'm  saying, like, fine, 
[01:15:00]  but, I mean,  if you're not a  shopper at Best Buy,  I mean, who started  Chicken Foot before?  Then you're just  downloading this shit  anyway, right?  Because they have  signs and those  stands with the  CDs on it and  every TV in the  store is running  some Chicken Foot  videos.  It's probably just  a big promotion.  Chicken Foot.  Who fucking buys  discs anymore?  Speaking of music,  we were talking  about the Beatles  because they, what,  remaster that shit?  Yeah, right?  Remember we were  talking about that?  I didn't get that.  It was sold out  when I went for it.  I fucking got it.  It's a shitload of 
[01:15:30]  money, but I got  it.  How is it?  Well, I decided  that I wanted to  listen to the Beatles  from the beginning  all the way to the  end.  The first few years  of the Beatles  is horrendous.  They're the fucking  Everly Brothers.  It's like bubble  gummy, almost  50s music.  It's almost 50s  music.  It's like one  year away from  doo-wop, doo-wop,  doo-wop, doo-wop.  And they sound like  the Everly Brothers.  And there's so many  unfamiliar songs that 
[01:16:00]  you just don't know.  I'm sorry.  Except for the people  that are really,  really into the Beatles.  You know how many  Beatles songs?  You play some of  those new, the  earlier Beatles  albums, you don't  know most of the  songs on there.  How many Beatles  songs you don't  know, you've never  heard?  But then when they  start smoking the pot,  you know every single  song they did.  You know every single  song except for maybe  a couple here and  there.  But the early Beatles,  there is easily 50%  of the songs that the  average person doesn't  know.  I prefer the later stuff,  but there's two of the 
[01:16:30]  greatest hits albums  from Apple Records,  62 to 65 and then  65 to 67.  I forget the exact  years.  And the one is red,  one is blue.  The older one is the  red one.  And they had fucking a  lot of great songs.  Yeah.  But it makes a good  point.  Their sound was  fucking almost do-wop.  Yeah.  It was different.  Yeah, they were  taking, they weren't  really, they hadn't  fallen into their own  like being the Beatles.  They were using other  people's sounds and  shit like that.  But that's what makes  it interesting to start  from the beginning and  then you see how they 
[01:17:00]  slowly developed into  that just, you know.  Got an example of any  awful old Beatles?  I want to hear one of  those now.  Give me one of the,  no, no.  How about yesterday?  Give me the first  album.  In my life?  Huh?  I am the walrus.  Cuckoo.  Cuckoo.  What song is this  there, Travis?  No, I'm not that  song.  No.  We're talking about  the ones we don't  know.  You just fucking  ruined my entire  point.  Get like one from  fucking, give me  their first album  and I'll, I'll pick 
[01:17:30]  their first album.  Please Please Me.  Every day.  See, that's another  popular song.  Paperback Writer's a  great song.  No, I'm saying  what's Chains?  Yeah, Chains.  Eleanor Rigby.  These are all  old songs.  Anna got to,  Anna, go to him.  Go with Anna, go to  him.  Where are you?  Everyone knows  this song.  Yes.  Even the old  stuff is toe  tappers. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  No, we don't  have that one.  Of course.  Probably because  you don't know it.  There are Beatles  songs they don't  have?  Yes.  How do you not  have any Beatles  songs?  Everyone.  Go with Ask Me  Why.  Yeah.  This is all off  the first album.  No.  See, that's  That's the point  of making.  That's why.  That's the point  of making.  These are songs  that no one  knows.  There's a song  called Boys.  Yeah.  Ringo wrote  that one.  Go with Boys. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, that's not  going to be there.  How many songs  off the first  album does  Sirius XM have  in their  mess?  One.  Which ones  do they got for  the first album?  Can you look it  up that way,  Travis?  What, Meet the  Beatles?  No, it's actually  not Meet the  Beatles.  Please, please,  me.  Yeah, please,  me.  If you want to  hear Boys,  I think I probably  have it here on  a YouTube video.  We've got a lot  of Please, Please,  me.  What songs you  have from  Please, Please,  There's a Place,  P.S. I Love You,  Baby It's You,  Twist and Shout, 
[01:19:00]  I saw her standing  there,  Please, Please,  me.  Danny's got it  over here.  Oh, okay.  Shut that shit  off.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  I've been told  when a boy  is a girl  Take a trip  around the world  Hey, hey  Walk you up  Walk back today  Walk you up  Walk back today  Walk you up  Walk back today  Walk you up  Hey, hey 
[01:19:30]  Hey, hey  Hey, hey  What's his name  with the glasses?  Roy Orbison.  Actually, this one  isn't even as bad  as some of the  other ones I  listened to over  the break.  It sounds  about true  at the end.  Buddy Holly  a little bit.  Yeah.  Walks with him  sound like  the Big Bopper  that fucking  stupid Chantilly  Lace.  What a one-hit  wonder.  Yeah, this isn't  the sound of 
[01:20:00]  the Beatles  that we all know.  They were still  finding their way.  Yup.  Talking about  boys now?  What the fuck  are you talking  about?  And then a nice  bad George  Harrison lead.  You don't think  these leads were  good?  Oh.  Sounds like  his fingers are  stuck in the strings  trying to pull  them out.  Yeah.  This is very  Beach Boys 
[01:20:30]  too, isn't it?  This should be  like the background  for a fucking  surf suit.  Ringo's  drumming  song.  Give me another  one from that  album.  Bop,  shoe-wop,  bop,  bop,  shoe-wop.  I want to hear  one that kind  of sounds like  the Everly  Brothers.  That was a  little,  yeah,  that was a  little Everly  Brother-ish.  You think?  They were just  imitating.  Anna,  go to him.  Yeah,  let's try this  one.  And I know  there's people  out there that  know these  songs.  All right,  relax. 
[01:21:00]  But the  average person  just doesn't.  Does this  sound like  fucking  I Am  The  Walrus?  It's  sounding like  the B-side  to Phil  Phillips'  Sea of  Love.  You  come  and  ask  me  girl  to set  you  free  girl  Have you  ever heard  this song  before?  No.  No.  No. 
[01:21:30]  It's like  Teen Angel.  Yeah.  Yeah,  yeah.  Yeah,  yeah.  Anna.  Girl  before you  go now  I want  you to  know  Why couldn't  Yoko  walk in  during this  shit?  Wreck  the band.  They'll  love you  so  but if  he loves  you  more  go with  him.  Go  with  him.  Keep  best in  there.  Oh, 
[01:22:00]  God.  That's  right.  Isn't  that weird?  Yeah.  It's a  little weird.  Bad.  Then they  discovered  the pod  and then  they got  their sound  that we  all know.  Right?  Abbey Road.  That's a good  album right  there.  That was the  last one.  I like that  one.  That's a  fucking good  one.  Help us  a good  song.  Was Abbey  Road the  last one?  I don't  know.  No,  Let It  Be.  Let It  Be?  Let It  Be.  Wasn't  that McCartney?  No,  you nerd.  You silly  goose.  Let It 
[01:22:30]  Be.  You're  silly.  What?  Mother Mary  comes in  and she says  that shit  to him?  Mother Mary  had terrible  advice.  No matter  what he  said,  she'd shut  him up.  Yeah,  you know,  I'm seeing  this girl.  Let It  Be.  Let It  Be.  You know,  I got  this girl,  I don't  know,  I have  sores in  my pain.  Let It  Be.  Let It  Be.  Speaking  words of  wisdom.  Words of  wisdom?  There's  nothing.  You know  what there's  words of  wisdom?  Hey,  there's a  fucking  hornet  flying by  my face.  What should  I do?  Let It  Be. 
[01:23:00]  That's  words of  wisdom.  Only in  that case.  Let It  Be is a  blow-off.  Mother Mary  had enough  of his  fucking  whinging.  People are  attacking me.  People are  saying they  like those  songs.  That's fine.  My point is  that the  average listener  never heard  those songs  before.  This song  stinks.  Really?  I'm kidding,  of course.  One of the  best songs  ever.  You know  about the  Let It  Be album?  They didn't  really go 
[01:23:30]  back in the  studio for  this.  It was just  a bunch of  fucking,  you know the  story,  right?  It was a  bunch of  fucking  tapes that  they didn't  know what  to do  with for  years.  And then  Phil Spector  came in and  said,  I'll make  something with  your fucking  tapes.  I think  that's the  story I  would let  it be.  This song  is fantastic.  made something  with those  fucking tapes.  Spector  worked on  the tracks.  Right?  Shot a  girl in the  face?  Yeah.  Well,  these tapes  were basically  most people  thought it  were there  was nothing  there.  And then  Phil Spector  really looked 
[01:24:00]  into it and  made something  out of it.  Yeah.  Pretty amazing  if you think  it.  Holy mackerel  is a good  song.  I had a  babysitter cry  when this  was being  played on  TV.  Why?  And it  was like  when it  came out  and she's  watching it  like she  was so  psyched that  it was  coming on  and it  was really  promoted  and everything  because Paul  McCartney  had this  giant  fucking  beard,  like a  big beard  mustache and  a hair at  the time.  That was his  look for the  time and  she wanted  the old  like the  cute little 
[01:24:30]  fucking  Paul McCartney  Dutch boy  hair cut.  I love you.  Yeah, it was  that Paul McCartney.  Was she crying?  She was crying  going,  was this the  advice she gave  you as you  stumbled towards  her whiskey  glass?  Just let it  be.  Let it be.  She was going,  oh, he looks  so old.  This is terrible.  Yeah, Let It  Be was recorded  before Abbey Road  but released  afterwards.  Wow.  After the band  was pretty much  done.  Yep.  This is one of  their best songs,  I think. 
[01:25:00]  See, that shit  happened back  back then.  Alphas come out,  songs come out  after the band's  gone.  That motherfucking  like Tupac.  Oh, you know what?  This is a very good  point from Gord  in South Carolina.  Gord.  Hey, Gordy.  Hey, Gordo.  Good morning.  Yeah, you guys  are missing the  point with those  early Beatles songs.  They predate the  Enchantment Under  the Sea dance.  Oh. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, so it's  just out of the  time, boys.  So until Michael  J. Fox played.  Oh, I say,  right, right.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Exactly.  All right, let's  go to Danny in  Baton Rouge.  Danny.  Yeah, that first  piece of shit  doo-wop song.  That was Ray  Charles'  what I said.  Exactly what it  sounded like.  Yeah, yeah.  A little Ray  Charles.  Yeah, absolutely.  They were just  doing the sound  of the time  until they found  their way.  Yeah, until they  told it. 
[01:26:00]  Very good, brother.  He wakes up to  music.  Mother Mary comes  in.  She's probably  having a drunken  party like at  Once for Warriors.  Fucking father's  going to punch  the mother in the  face.  There's music  playing and he  just wakes up and  she says, let it  be.  And she just  comes in saying,  let it be.  Mother Mary was a  retard.  The Later Years  of the Beatles.  What's your  worst song?  That's a stupid  one.  A-ching-a-ching-a-ching.  No, I'm talking  Beatles.  Sergeant Pepper. 
[01:26:30]  Seriously.  I like that, but it's  one of my least  favorite Beatles  songs.  Sergeant Pepper's  Lonely Hearts  Cup.  It's not a bad  song, but it's  one of my least  favorite of all the  Beatles songs I  like.  What about  Maxwell's Silver  Hammer?  Bang, bang,  bang, bang,  bang, bang.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let me say  hi to Derek in  Louisiana.  Derek.  Jesus fucking  Tits McGillicuddy is  doing the weather on  fucking Fox.  She walked away.  I was fucking  noticing that too.  The blonde, right?  What big heavy  ones?  The blonde with  the white belt.  No. 
[01:27:00]  They're so heavy that  she needs to hoist  them up a little higher.  They're natural biggums.  Yes, and Fat Ray  Leota's behind the  desk.  Who's that guy?  I'm sorry, caller.  She's got biggums.  Yeah, what's  happening?  Yeah.  Hey.  Gentlemen, how  in the hell are you  going to talk bad  about any music when  you love Black  Savage so much?  Oh, shit.  Well, that's what's  called a musical  taste, sir, and we  all have our  opinions.  That's musical  bullshit.  Black Savage  sounds the same  every damn song.  Oh, boy.  Well, at any time 
[01:27:30]  you're not familiar  with a certain music,  and I would probably  say the same thing  about certain bands  would all sound the  same to me, but  it wouldn't to a fan.  It doesn't sound the  same to you.  Is that the same  riffs for everything?  I actually can...  Every Sabbath album,  honestly, sounds so  different to me.  Like, to me, there's  nothing on Master  Reality that would  sound right on  Volume 4, nothing  on Sabbath, Bloody  Sabbath that would  sound right on  Black Sabbath.  Each album had its  own distinct sound  to me.  Okay.  Love you, Jim.  Thank you, sir. 
[01:28:00]  All right.  Hey, we got  Average Listener  checking in.  I love when the  Average Listener  checks in.  Average Listener,  what do you got?  Hey, Opekins.  I'm the Average  Listener.  I just want to let  you know that I  do not know those  Beatles songs that  you're playing.  All right?  There you go.  Average Listener.  He's the Average  Listener.  Backing up my  point.  Oof.  Jesus Christ.  Who's their baby?  Squiggy from  Laverne and Shirley?  Tiger Woods and  his wife's baby?  That kid's got some  fucking awful  triangle hairdo.  What do they got  on Tiger?  Same shit?  Same shit. 
[01:28:30]  They will be pounding  this fucking story.  Oh, my God.  But it's such a  non-story.  He's a guy who  plays golf, who  had a fight with  his wife, and he  hit a fire hydrant,  and it's headline  news?  What a country of  assholes.  God, we dumb  motherfuckers.  You're so fucking  right.  It's annoying.  It's just taking up  why are we supposed  to care about Tiger  Woods' life.  Or have it as a  blurb.  There's no new  news.  This is not front  page, lead 
[01:29:00]  story shit.  Where's the  Columbia professor  punching his  white cohort?  Where is it?  That never  happened.  What are you  talking about?  Tiger Woods'  statement is very  suspicious.  This is a private  matter.  Before that, he's  basically saying it's  all my fault.  It's very embarrassing  for my family.  Why is it  embarrassing?  Fucking abroad,  perhaps?  Well, that's what I'm  getting at.  That's a little  embarrassing?  If we're supposed  to believe that he  just kind of crashed  his car leaving his  house because...  Who knows?  Maybe his wife  is a kook and  he's protecting  her.  Maybe, yeah. 
[01:29:30]  A little bit of  an anger streak in  her there if she  did indeed belt  him over the head  with a golf club.  Yeah, who knows?  It might have been  something really  innocent.  Like if she said,  how's the food?  Oh, the steak was  a little undercooked  and she came out  with a golf club and  swung it at him and  started screaming  racial epithets and  he had to drive  away.  She's a psycho.  How great would  it be that he's  in hell like that?  It's amazing he was  able to hide it for  that long.  He's basically a  billionaire but he  has to deal with 
[01:30:00]  that.  He keeps winning  tournaments because  she hits him when  he doesn't.  And by the way,  what is this  blindgossip.com?  I don't even know  if you want to  tackle that but  go ahead, Jimmy.  What is it?  I don't know.  Steve fucking  handed in.  It's probably one  of Steve's websites.  What is blind  gossip?  It's obviously  someone who doesn't  want to take  responsibility for  saying to it  publicly.  I hate blind items.  Blind items is  where they tell  the whole story  but they don't  add in anybody's  name and you're  supposed to just  figure it out  like a little  puzzle as to  who it is.  Oh, you're right.  Okay. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  I don't even know  if this is related  to Tiger Woods  or not.  Yeah, exactly.  That's why.  It's like, you  know, it's a  blind item.  It's it.  You want to read  it?  And you're  supposed to go,  oh, well, maybe  this is that person  or this one or  Nick Nolte or  fucking Hoff or  you know, whoever.  Yes.  Pete Sampras.  As if this famous  athlete doesn't have  enough dang  problems right  now, you can  add a couple  more to the  list.  His wife knew  that he had  relied on certain  substances in  the past to  relieve his  extreme bouts 
[01:31:00]  with performance  anxiety.  However, she  did not know  until a couple  of days ago  that he'd been  experimenting with  other substances  that could get  flagged during  testing.  The second  problem he has  is his penchant  for women who  are paid  handsomely to  do discreet,  to be discreet  about their  extracurricular  activities with  him.  Word is, he  likes to be  punished for his  bad behavior.  He was subject  to harsh  discipline at  an early age  and he tells 
[01:31:30]  the women that  he needs them to  continue that  tradition in order  for him to be  perfect.  But don't expect  either of these  habits to come to  the forefront in  the coming months.  Everyone is  getting paid off  to lie or keep  their trash shut.  What a bunch of  fucking horse shit.  And that person  is Jim Norton.  That could be  anybody.  That's probably  accurate.  That doesn't  sound too crazy.  Alright, we're  all thinking who  they're writing  about, obviously.  Name a second  person.  Name a second  person this could  possibly be. 
[01:32:00]  Jesus, any  athlete.  It could be  any, literally  it could be, we  all think, of  course, Tiger  Woods is what  you think because  he's in the  news.  It could be  any athlete.  It could be  any athlete.  Why?  You need to  know about an  athlete that had  a father that  worked him hard.  Or parents  that disciplined him.  No, I mean  people that  follow sports.  Name another  guy.  This could be  Roger Clemens.  You need to  know about an  athlete that had  an overbearing  father that  worked him  really hard.  I don't know  if Ken Griffey  Jr. did because  Ken Griffey  Sr.  I guess anyone  whose father  was a pro.  One of the 
[01:32:30]  Mannings it  could be.  Has to be  someone that's  perfect which  means won a  lot of titles.  What about  Andre Agassi?  Andre Agassi.  Alright, that's  all I'm asking  for another name  besides the obvious.  Is he married?  Yeah, that's  Steffi Graf.  Alright.  Agassi, is he  still married?  Yeah, that's  Steffi Graf.  Alright, you just  proved my point.  You named another  athlete.  It could be him  for his bad  behavior. 
[01:33:00]  But he just put  out a book about  all that and it  said don't expect  these habits to  come to the  forefront in coming  months.  Everyone's going to  be paid to lie or  keep their trash  shut.  But he just  put a book out  that pretty much  exposed everything.  So that's wrong.  I don't know if  it's Andre Agassi.  Andy Pettit.  Andy Pettit.  He knew.  Goodness gracious.  He knew.  You should see  what's going on  in the Yankee  dugout.  Pettit's getting  a spank in my  persona.  And Clemage  has on a face 
[01:33:30]  dildo in  George's box.  Right now I'm  riding Clemage  face dildo in  George's box.  He lacks a lot  of discipline.  Pettit's smiling.  Passat has  gone on panel.  I guess we have  the answer to the  question who's  going to be taking  that strap on.  I guess there's  more questions.  She's the greatest.  That was her  worst moment ever.  That's anybody's 
[01:34:00]  worst moment ever.  Hitler didn't have  moments that bad.  Mussolini didn't.  It's a terrible  moment.  Fuck we got the  other athlete.  Wow.  Pumpsy fucking  green.  Pumpsy green.  God that  pumpsy green.  He didn't have  problems.  Let's go to  Rick in Indiana.  Hey Rick.  Hey.  Well one big  news thing that  isn't making you  know too much  news with the  media is this  climate change  bullshit.  Right.  That came out  proving that it's  all a bunch of  fucking bullshit. 
[01:34:30]  shit.  Yeah.  What was this  about it?  I did see a  fat Al Gore.  Yeah.  A bunch of shit  got leaked out  some emails and  stuff and it's  pretty much what a  bunch of global  warming authorities  saying that it's  bullshit.  It's pretty much  the long and short  of it.  Yeah.  Saying that  well this really  is bullshit.  It's all cyclical.  All the weather.  Don't give me a  global warming  bullshit.  And Al Gore has  made more fucking 
[01:35:00]  money on global  warming.  Oh shit.  Huh?  What?  Coffee.  We might go off  the air.  Oh shit.  Oh shit.  A little bit.  Just a couple of  buttons.  Keep talking.  A couple of  buttons.  If I hear  crackling.  Oh shit.  That's not bad.  Do you hear that?  Uh oh.  You're crackling.  Is that crackling?  Sorry.  Guys.  Continue.  On this mop  up.  Oh this is a  bad one. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  They're calling it  a global warming  scandal.  Media silent on  global warming  scandal.  Oh look at that.  It's Greg  Gutfeld.  Where's Gutfeld?  I guess he talked  about it.  Of course he's  going to talk  about it.  He's usually a  coward.  Oh my god.  On his  crack log.  He's got a  Greg log.  He's got a  Greg log.  His Greg logs  are brilliant  man.  I'm on  right out  tonight actually.  Very well 
[01:36:00]  written.  They really are  brilliant.  You're like a  regular on that  show now man.  Yeah yeah I'm  on every Monday  this month.  Every Monday.  They call me  Monday Jimmy.  The Monday  Kid.  Monday Jimmy.  Call yourself  the Monday  Kid.  Vince from  Bayonne.  I think we're  good again right  Vince?  Me and you?  We're good.  Bayonne.  He had a problem  with the Bobo  thing the day  before we left  or the day we  left.  Why?  The Bobo  thing was  great.  I don't even  remember that.  No?  It was  pre-vacation. 
[01:36:30]  PV I don't  remember.  I don't  remember  PV.  By the way  what's PV  again?  Pre-vacation.  Pre-vacation.  Vince.  I'm sorry I  don't like  Gutfeld's  open shirt  though.  Trying to  show a little  too much  chest.  Yeah I  know.  What's he  doing?  Trying to  be sexy.  Showing off  a little  of that  chest  hair.  Yeah he's  been hitting  the gym.  Proud of  himself.  Vince from  Bayonne writes  Wow thanks  for the heads  up on the  Fox 5  Weather Girl.  Tits McGee  indeed.  Tell Vince I  didn't say  that.  I said  Tits McGillicuddy.  Tits McGillicuddy is a lot 
[01:37:00]  funnier.  Tits McGee.  Tits McGee.  Tits McGee is  someone else.  Exactly.  That's actually a  real person.  McGillicuddy.  Speaking of  sports.  You hear about the  Clippers announcers?  What?  Ralph Lawler and  Michael Smith.  Why?  One game  suspension.  Why?  A flood of  emails.  Yes.  A flood of  emails.  Well for making  comments about an  Iranian player.  Yeah.  Why?  So? 
[01:37:30]  Hamer Hadadi  I believe.  Marty throws  one down.  Look who's  in.  13 point  lead.  Hamer Hadadi?  Yeah.  Where's he  from?  He's the first  Iranian to play  in the NBA?  There aren't  any Iranian  players in the  NBA.  He's the only  one.  He's Iran?  I guess so.  That Iran?  Yes.  And the real  Iran.  Wow. 
[01:38:00]  Well,  Hadadi.  Jesus.  That's what they  said.  Well, they have  to stop the game  to get the  Iranian out.  Was that it?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Come on.  That's it.  Where's the  offensive part?  I think they  mispronounced  something?  Well, from  what I remember  reading about  the story  before the  break,  one of the  complaints was  that instead  of saying  Iranian,  they over  enunciated the  I, so they  were saying  Iranian, and  I guess  somebody was  offended.  Like I  Italian?  Right.  I guess  someone was  offended by  the way they  said that.  Are you fucking  kidding me? 
[01:38:30]  They got one  email.  That was one  of the complaints.  Didn't they  get one  email?  That's what I  heard.  I heard one  email came in.  I could be  wrong.  By the way,  all the stories  say one  email.  Vince has  tried to  defend himself.  He couldn't  spell McGillicuddy,  so he went  with McGee.  Is that fair  enough?  But he spelled  McGillicuddy good  enough.  Exactly, to defend  himself.  It's a horrible  argument, Vince.  I smell Vince  D-U-M-M-Y.  Let's get back  to this.  Maybe they say  some more shit.  That's H-A-D-D-A-D-R. 
[01:39:00]  Here's not  Borat's older  brothers.  Oh, okay.  St.  Young.  Joe Tinsley  is back.  Gay goes  out.  If they ever  make a movie  about Hadaddy,  I'm going to  get Sasha  Baron Cohen  to play  the part.  Gay had  quite a second  half.  By the way,  when the first  joke bombed,  what way do  you want to  segue into  another one?  They should  be suspended  for not being  funny.  Maybe that's  it.  Right.  They said  work on  your comedy  chops.  Gay had  quite a second 
[01:39:30]  half with  21 points in  the half,  getting the  greeting from  the happy  head coach  Lionel  Hollins.  here's Hadaddy.  Nice little  backdoor pass.  Look at the  pass.  I guess those  Iranians can  pass the ball.  Especially the  post players.  They're about  their guards.  They're just  shocked that an  Iranian can play  basketball.  Yes.  Surprised they're not  throwing around a  severed head.  He's the first  Iranian to play  in NBA. 
[01:40:00]  Smith pronounced  Iranian as  I-Ranian.  Some people  do.  Some people  say Iran.  Some people  say Iran.  It's just the  way people  fucking say it.  Some people  say Iran.  I say Iran.  Yeah.  Iranian is the  right way.  Yeah.  I say Iranian.  So do I.  I-Rain.  Ian.  Ian.  Ian.  Who cares?  Yeah.  How did they  get suspended  for that?  Sorry, we're not  pronouncing...  Oh, fuck this  country.  Sorry, we're not  pronouncing Ahmadinejad's  home country, right?  Yeah. 
[01:40:30]  Fucking assholes.  Yeah.  Fucking terrorist  nation.  Sorry.  Guy's playing  basketball, though?  That's a little weird.  Hell's an Iranian  playing basketball.  A little weird.  I just want to  repeat everything  he said.  I know.  So I can get  some more time  off.  I'll be suspended.  Great joke, though.  Hey, we should get  Sasha Baron cut.  We got it.  Got it the first  time he said  Borat.  You mean the guy  that played a  character from  fucking former  Soviet bloc country  and not fucking 
[01:41:00]  the Middle East  dummy?  So that fucking  Bruno on demand  again, and I  said, nope.  I have no desire  to see it.  None.  No.  No.  I didn't like...  I didn't think  Borat stunk.  I just didn't like...  I don't like any of the  stage stuff.  I just loved the show.  I liked the Borat.  The real...  I liked the real  stuff in Borat.  I didn't like the...  I didn't like any of the  fucking storyline.  I didn't care about it.  He's funny enough  just annoying people.  Yeah.  But Bruno just...  For some reason  just can't...  Bruno's a funny  character, too, but I  know it's going to be  staged, and I don't  want to see anything  staged.  I saw funny people. 
[01:41:30]  Anyone else see funny  people?  No.  Eh?  No.  Jimmy?  No, another thing I  have no involvement  in.  Why would I?  Eh.  Was it good?  I saw funny people.  Did it stink?  Remember when a  listener got the  Uncle Paul thing on  the news for his  birthday?  Oh, yeah.  Was it his birthday?  I'm 57 years young.  They got it wrong,  yeah.  It was Uncle Paul's  birthday. 
[01:42:00]  They did the birthday  wishes on a local  news channel.  Mm-hmm.  And then they did  Hargis, right?  Did they?  I didn't hear  Hargis.  Yeah, it's right  behind you.  Paul Hargis.  Paul Hargis.  Do we have the  Paul Hargis?  Do we have the  Uncle Paul?  Yeah, I want to  hear that.  Yeah, we should  play the two  leading up to the  there's a new one  is what I'm getting  at here.  I'm amazed this  sandp*** can play  ball at all.  It's amazing. 
[01:42:30]  Now, that might  get him suspended,  but sing Iranian.  Jesus.  You want a  happy birthday  Paul Hargis?  Yeah, whatever  one you got.  Yeah, I think  this is.  Let's start with  that one and  then get the  other one, too,  if you have  it.  Here's, uh...  So, uh, it's  becoming a thing.  It's not that.  It's Opie.  It's the whole  fucking bit.  Sorry, I jumped  again.  All our bits are  all over YouTube.  It's going to fall  on us.  No.  Fucking mouth first. 
[01:43:00]  I love suicide  jokes.  Jimmy.  There's the big  titted monster.  Holy shit.  Oh, there she is.  And those are  fucking real.  Look at those  big tits.  Jesus.  They're real tits.  She should rob  banks as the  tits kid.  She's fucking  great.  She's got a belt  on so they don't  fall out of the  bottom of her  sweater.  She's...  I can't figure  her out.  Wow.  They're a little  weighty.  And now here  with the weather  is...  Here with the  weather is big  juicy tits.  I mean, uh...  Oh, here's the  Paul Hargis. 
[01:43:30]  I got...  Do you got the  other one?  You got the  Uncle Paul one,  too?  I have the Uncle  Paul one, too.  Oh, you got the  Uncle Paul one?  All right, start with  that there,  Danny.

[01:46:30]  And little  Jimmy.  Little Jimmy.  The big 3-0.  Jesus Christ.  Man.  Very good,  whoever did that  one.  God, I love  that people do  that.  I think I tweeted  over the break.  I'm not really  sure, though.  All right.  Ted Sheckler.  You want to learn  about Captain Sully  or do you want  to take a little  break?  I got to piss  badly.  I heard a little  something about  Captain Sully. 
[01:47:00]  Might have heard  some salty stuff.  Oh, indeed.  All right, we'll do  a little of that  after the break.  And what about  the couple  crashing the White  House?  We'll get into  that after the break,  too.  Yeah, we'll talk  about that one.  Maybe some of the  other things that  happened while we  were away.  Opie and Anthony,  we're live today.  Stay there.  What else is  going on today?  We hear about  the 41-year-old 
[01:47:30]  man who was  adopted at birth  to find out  years later  that his father  is Charles Manson.  Charles Manson.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  You see the picture  of the guy?  He looks kind of  like Charles Manson.  He looks a little  like Chuck.  A little bit.  Is he a law-abiding  citizen, this kid?  Charlie, Charlie Manson.  Yeah, he's a peace  man.  He's idol.  He's like Gandhi.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So he's not lying.  No, I'm actually  not.  He's like the  polar opposite.  Let me look at you. 
[01:48:00]  Okay.  And he talked  to his mother  and she eventually  told him who it was  and she said  Manson raped her  at an orgy.  She probably just  fucked him.  We raped her.  Shut up.  At an orgy in 67.  And the guy  said he wrote  Manson letters  and they've written  back and forth  but even Manson  sent him a corner  but they haven't  talked.  Fucking Jimmy  nailed it.  That's sweet.  There you go.  A Gandhi following  peace-loving  free-spirited  vegetarian  who was adopted  at birth  has discovered  the worst possible 
[01:48:30]  thing a son  could find out  about his father.  His dad  is Charles Manson.  And the true  iron is he loves  tater tots  and fulgis  cloth.  Oh, shit.  It's like finding  out that Adolf  Hitler is your  father, said  Matthew Roberts.  No, that would  be like finding  out Adolf Hitler  is your father.  Well, that's a  dream for Anthony.  That's silly.  What?  Would that be a  dream come true?  No!  You were given  away for adoption.  What are you  kidding?  And your father  resemblance?  I'll get my  mustache, shave it 
[01:49:00]  down a little bit.  Let me show you.  No.  No?  No.  So that happened  during break.  And then you got  ten students suspended  for taking part in  Kick-A-Jew Day.  What?  You didn't hear  about this one.  We got audio for  this one.  This is crazy.  This is great.  What's wrong with  people?  I know.  Makes you want to  re-register into  school, doesn't it?  Does he look like  Manson?  Like, trim down that  weird goatee of his  and, you know.  Wow, Manson looks  fucking old, man.  Yeah.  What a shitty beard  he has.  Yeah, Manson's 
[01:49:30]  looks like a goat.  What happened?  What happened to  Manson?  70-something.  Prison's not agreeing  with him.  He is an old dude  now, right?  He's not scary  at all.  Really?  No, he used to be.  Not anymore.  Boy, that swastika  just never went  away, did it?  Dude, this is just  a silly look on him.  What are you doing?  A dumb beard?  It really does look  silly.  It's kind of fading  a little bit.  Is it?  A little bit?  I think so.  You'd think you could  change it into  something else. 
[01:50:00]  Get some other  work done.  Exactly.  Have a tic-tac-toe  board put on a  fucking Rubik's Cube.  Yeah, they should  make it into a  silly tentative.  Turn it into  something silly.  Yeah.  Four little arms  waving at somebody.  Hello, hello, hello,  hello.  Here's the  kick-a-Jew story.  Ten students were  suspended from a  Florida middle school  for their role in  what's being called  Kick-a-Jew Day.  Word had spread  around school that  if you saw a Jewish  student on Thursday,  you were supposed  to kick them.  According to the  school, several 
[01:50:30]  students were asked  about their religion  and kicked throughout  the day.  The parents of  some of the  kicked students  say the punishment  isn't enough.  Oh, I think it's  horrible.  I don't understand  why they would do  that.  I think it should  have been more  harsh, definitely.  Personally, I think  it's a non-issue.  You're not concerned  that this is going  on?  Not particularly.  I don't care,  tell you the truth.  Jew gets kicked,  don't matter to me  none.  I love how the  news guy explained  it.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:51:00]  Like we didn't  know what kick  a Jew day would  mean.  Yeah, it doesn't  really need an  explanation.  When you see a Jew,  you're supposed to  raise your foot until  it connects with  said hebe.  Thank you for the  explanation, asshole.  That just sounds  silly.  I like the other  thing the kids are  doing in school.  What's that?  The fucking  flick a nut.  Flick a nut?  The fucking  ball tapping.  What the fuck is  that?  Ball tapping.  Dude, ball 
[01:51:30]  tapping's going on.  My brother's a fan  of that.  Kid actually wound  up losing like his  balls.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Is that the Tate  murders?  Yeah.  The fucking  pictures are  brutal.  It's a nice  couch.  Looks comfy.  It is.  It's an American  flag.  My brother and  his boys during  Paddy's Day do  that fucking punch  each other in the  fucking cock thing.  Yeah, this is  ball flicking.  You're supposed to  flick.  Like you're playing  paper football? 
[01:52:00]  People have just  been walking up and  kicking other guys  in the balls.  And one kid actually  had to have his  testicle removed.  Jesus.  Because it is  fucked up so bad  that it built up  scar tissue.  Because they would  kick him every day  in the nuts.  He was like the kid  who just fucked  with his balls  every day.  So he had to  have a ball removed.  Why don't the kids  out there understand  that those are the  future murderers?  Will you leave  them the fuck alone  so we can all  live in peace?  Stop picking on  the kids at school.  They turn around  and get their  revenge.  It's bullying. 
[01:52:30]  It's just called  bullying.  Let's get into  some Sully action.  Oh, Captain Sully  coming in for a  landing, is he?  He sure is.  Let's not forget  Mad Dog, Chris Russo  will be here at  nine o'clock.  Yes.  Look at her,  honey.  Looks like she might  have eaten a little  too much turkey.  Oh, Jesus.  Look at D-Boy.  D-Boy didn't even  notice the hot chick.  He's touching his 
[01:53:00]  nipples.  That fucking  Caligula hairdo  of his.  What a crepe.  D-Boy, I didn't  speak to D-Boy  too much over the  break, but I did  get a communication  from him over the  vacation.  It was an email  that included a  link to the  beginner's cock  pumping guide.  Why would he  send that?  Because he's D-Boy.  Because he's D-Boy.  Is he over  Lionsgate yet?  No.  No.  Still not over it.  He will never  see a Lionsgate  movie.  It's crazy.  Yuck.  Oh, my God.  A turnip just  walked by. 
[01:53:30]  Holy shit.  Is the sound  on?  A turnip in a  Christmas sweater.  Yeah.  Let me see.  I'll hit the  sound time.  It's terrible.  Why?  Because we'll get  in trouble.  Who's that  frump?  With HR puffing  stuff.  Who's that frump?  She's a little  frumpy.  Got to be honest  with you.  Here's Captain  Sully and what  he's up to.  Yeah.  Well, turn the  audio on.  I want them to  hear this shit.  No.  Why?  HR.  Oh.  What about the  relationship?  Did it only help  the relationship? 
[01:54:00]  Did it put strain  on the relationship?  It has to impact  in some ways.  Both.  Both.  Sometimes it was  so intense it  would push us  away because I  was busy and I  wasn't available  to her or the  girls and so I  had my priorities  screwed up.  He doesn't know  I'm going to say  this but I  joked the other  day that said  you know the  hero sex really  helps a 20  year old marriage.  Rock star sex.  There's the  headline right  there.  Rock star hero 
[01:54:30]  sex is what  they're having  there.  When you fuck  somebody they  overdose.  That's good.  That's a great  way to do it.  Yeah.  You don't look at  Sully and think  of him really  pounding away on  his old wife.  Can we play a  game called  Who Has the  Dryest Pussy  Out There?  I don't know.  I haven't.  Come on.  Danny we'll  start with you.  Who has the  dryest pussy  out there?  Who would you  think would have  the dryest pussy?  When you think  dry pussy what  image comes to  you to mind?  The first person  that pops into 
[01:55:00]  my head.  Let's play  dryest pussy  out there.  I got one.  Okay.  Start with you.  Barbara Walters.  Wow.  Dry fucking  game over.  I think someone  else came up  with something.  How about  Estelle Getty?  Wow.  How about  Estelle Getty?  She kind of  She seems like  she might have  just a little  moisture left.  She's dead.  She's dead.  Oh is she?  How about  any girl who  fucks Iraq?  He's not even  in here. 
[01:55:30]  He's been  minding his own  business for the  last 10 days.  You know by the  way I want to say  I left Iraq  alone when he  walked in as we  were talking about  the big titted  monster.  Yeah.  I was going to  make a comment  but I left him  alone out of the  goodness of my  heart.  You just  thought you had  to bring it up  from the air.  Yes I did.  So did you  actually leave him  alone?  No.  Barbara Walters.  I think you  fucking  Barbara Walters  just has a  fucking  just like 
[01:56:00]  I pictured  her labia  having powder  on it like  the old gum  that used to  come in the  packages of  baseball cards.  Sure.  Like a fine  dust.  You got to  look at an  old broad's  lips.  Yeah.  Lips mean  pussy.  Her mouth lips?  Oh yeah.  That's when you  can really figure  out who has  the broads pussy  out there.  And then it  wicks up the  cracks.  Oh yeah.  I'd say  Nancy Pelosi.  Nancy Pelosi.  Yeah. 
[01:56:30]  Dry as pussy.  Yeah.  Oh well.  Fucking Nancy  Reagan.  It's got to  be up there.  Nancy Reagan  might be in  the lead.  Wow.  Nothing in  there.  Not a  droplet.  Not any  moisture.  Just a  crawl space.  Just a  sandstorm.  NASA's going  to ram a  satellite into  it and then  take photos of  what comes out  to see if  there's any  water left  in her  vag.  It went  on too  long.  It was 
[01:57:00]  it really  was an  eight part  bomb.  Saturation  bombing.  Yes.  Dr. Steve  has one.  Look up.  Oh.  Helen Gurley  Brown.  Oh.  Yeah.  Also Joan  Rivers coming  in.  Hillary Clinton.  I think Joan  takes a dick  every so  often.  Yep.  She probably  takes a dick  though.  That doesn't  mean that the  dry pussy isn't  getting, you  know, a  dick. 
[01:57:30]  No, I think  dry pussy doesn't  even get any  Oh, God.  Helen Gurley  Brown might have  the dryest  pussy.  That is really  nasty.  Jessica Tandy  if she's still  alive.  Helen Gurley  Brown is a good  one.  Yeah, that is  bad.  I'll bet you  Jessica Tandy's  box looks like  the underside of  my bed.  Probably has  dust bunnies  in it.  Janet Reno is  coming in.  Let's go with  Peter of  Massachusetts.  Peter.  That's Watley. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, I was  going to say  the Queen of  England's pussy  is probably full  of spiders and  fucking cobwebs  and shit like  that.  Could have  just said dry.  Like your  mother?  Cobwebs and  shit like that.  Yeah, exactly.  He's trying to  think of dry  things like  parchment that  hasn't been  contaminated.  Susan Boyle's  coming in.  Yeah.  That has  moisture down  there.  It's not  getting used.  It's flop  sweat.  She has  been all  over the  news during 
[01:58:30]  vacation.  She sang on  the Today  Show, I  believe.  Did she?  Right.  Her album's  number one.  Yeah, it  was number  one on, oh  God.  Her album  was number  one on  Amazon.  On MooTube.  Oh, MooTube.  On Amazon, as  far as pre-orders  go.  Oh, you know  what?  Jordan from  Scranton, a  little known  fact.  Jordan writes,  Joan Rivers  used to powder  British judges'  wigs.  Fuck. 
[01:59:00]  Hold on.  Oh, no.  I'll see.  Wigs by  queefing on  them.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I think they  gotta be alive.  Eleanor Roosevelt.  Stop.  Who's that?  Who's that, Danny?  That's, uh, this is  Travis's pick for  Dryas Pussy.  It's Linda Hunt.  Oh, Linda Hunt is  that old broad.  Wow.  That's the, like,  the midget.  Yeah, she's fairly  awful.  Not to be confused  with Helen Hunt,  too.  That's true.  From Twister. 
[01:59:30]  Helen Thomas.  Helen Thomas,  anyone?  No.  That's coming in  by, uh,  Brian in New Paltz.  Who's...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  She's the, uh,  reporter,  the White House  reporter.  Where's the red  and ask the first  question?  Isn't she dead now?  No, I think she's  still kicking in.  I thought she died.  I think she was  able to ask Obama  a question.  Yeah.  Unless she died  recently.  She asks the first  question, what,  every time?  Every fucking time.  Why?  It's tradition.  I don't know.  Who could keep  track of this? 
[02:00:00]  Oh, we got it  right here.  Uh, Carlin in  Ohio.  Carlin.  It's gotta be that  old bitch,  Alan Alda.  Alan Alda.  Jimmy farted at  your line.  He didn't like it.  Ah, let's go to  Eric in Jersey.  Eric.  Judge Judy by far.  Judge Judy?  No, I disagree.  No way.  Probably crazy.  She's probably,  because she's,  she's such a  conservative judge lady,  she's probably  like a dirty girl.  Dude, Helen Thomas 
[02:00:30]  could be the winner,  man.  That's why.  We're looking at  a fucking picture.  Madeline Albright,  her vag has gotta be  a fucking horror show.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It probably looks like,  it probably looks like  a baked snail.  Helen Thomas should  do horror movies.  Look at that fucking face.  Doesn't need any  makeup or nothing.  Margaret Thatcher?  Horrendous.  That's gotta be  really dry.  It only gets wet  when fucking,  when the Britons  invade somewhere.  Like, in 2001,  when they went  into Afghanistan, 
[02:01:00]  she fucking  stuck to the seat  too long as well.  Let's go with  Carol Channing.  Good old Carol Channing.  Long as well.  Carol Channing,  yeah, yeah.  Let's go with  Carol Channing.  Wow, she's gotta  look horrid these days.  Oh, there she is again.  Oh, wait,  big-titted monster.  Holy shit.  Holy mother of a...  They are just so weighty.  You can see her nip  showing through, too.  Yeah.  I know where the nip is.  A bad placement.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a little,  a little... 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That's it.  That's the nip.  She has a big,  hefty bra.  She's pointing  at the clouds.  She's got good  jerkole pants, too.  an L right by there  for large,  as in her tits.  Oh, that's...  H as in hullabaloo,  what I'd cause  if I got them  in my hands.  little letters  on the weather map. 
[02:02:00]  Wow-wee.  Oh, yeah.  Look at those heavy boobies.  They are some big,  heavy boobies.  Hey, don't leave the screen.  Oh, look,  I try to follow her  off the screen.  You can't do that.  No.  Big, fat breasts.  You like the big,  fat breasts?  I don't have a fetish  for them,  but hers are great.  Her little belt.  Yeah, you can just  appreciate them.  Nice and weighty.  Yeah.  They don't have to be big.  But that's nice of her.  No, they have to be big.  I've sworn off of 
[02:02:30]  TV news girl  weather traffic things.  So I'm not even  going to try with her.  I've never fucked  anyone on TV.  I'd like to.  No?  Yeah.  I've seen some  of your pilots.  You're right.  I really am  the black spot  on the lung  of new projects.  I'm fucking,  I'm pancreatic cancer  with a few punchlines.  We're ready to move on  from the driest pussy,  but there's an honorable  mention coming in. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  Honorable.  Barbara Bush.  Let's see what  Barbara Bush looks like  these days.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Helen Thomas  is still the leader,  huh?  Yeah, she definitely  wins.  Helen Thomas.  Barbara Bush,  she hasn't aged  in 25 years,  but she was old  before her time.  Yeah, she's like  the most bizarre  thing ever.  Big wrinkly jowls,  though.  She looks the same  as she did 20 years ago,  but it's like seeing  something in the  Jurassic era. 
[02:03:30]  Can you tell a fucking  20-year-old T-Rex  from a 70-year-old T-Rex?  No.  Never thought of that.  Yeah.  Uh, let me say  hi to Jason  in South Carolina.  Jason.  Dry vagina ever?  Bill Burr's grandmother.  Oh, Bill Burr's grandmother.  That's right.  Remember we talked  about her?  Oh, we certainly did.  I wasn't enjoying that.  I talked about  deep fucking her on the couch.  I didn't care for that at all.  No, we didn't.  Steve in Brooklyn.  Steve.  Yeah, man. 
[02:04:00]  Dr. Sue, the sex expert.  Dr. Sue?  No, Sue Jorgensen?  Yes.  No, that old,  dirty old lady?  No, she's probably  does nothing but have sex.  Who's Dr. Sue?  Oh, her.  Have you seen what  she looks like?  She looks like  an old fucking monkey skeleton.  She doesn't matter.  She's got some moisture left.  Who the hell wants to touch  who would touch that?  Dude, she would still  squeeze cum out of your balls.  Yeah, no.  Oh, fuck.  Would you touch that?  Huh?  Why not?  It's not a matter  of what we touch it, sir.  I know you're a sick fuck  and you like old ladies, 
[02:04:30]  but would you touch that?  Why not?  For the hell of it?  Sure.  Why not?  You're fucking dry hop.  You're going to break her back.  What the hell's going to happen  to you if you fuck the old broad?  You kill her.  You give her a heart attack.  Why?  Because you're such a stud?  Yeah.  No, I'm saying  because she's fucking  90 years old.  Yeah, we've done a lot of  material on her.  She seems pretty cool.  She talks to the kids  about sex.  Yeah, she likes vibrators  and shit like that.  She probably lubes up  and fucking...  Yeah, please. 
[02:05:00]  She's active.  Yeah.  She probably just spits  on a dildo.  She doesn't even lube it.  She just spits on it.  See the ads for those  Trojan condoms?  Which ones?  They're on a lot now,  those ads.  Which ones?  Which commercial?  No, they're the ones  that feel...  They're supposed to feel better  because...  See, what they did was...  They vibrate or something?  No, no, no, no, no.  What happened?  No, no.  What happened?  They take a condom  and like the bottom part,  they cut a big fucking hole  and you feel better.  So your dick is actually  rubbing against the vagina  and it feels great.  It looks like your penis  is wearing a little turtleneck. 
[02:05:30]  It's a brilliant concept, really.  Yeah, it's just cut a hole in it.  Man, you're...  That's great.  You should be selling  a lot of these.  See, the base of the condom  is the normal size.  So it squeezes around  the base of your dick.  Right.  But the top of it,  it balloons out.  So it's all loosey-goosey  and there's lube inside and outside.  So as you're fucking,  the whole condom  is sliding on your cock.  Why don't you just  fuck a party balloon?  But that's what you do  when you're fucking 
[02:06:00]  with a condom anyway.  Then you get nothing.  You're getting stiff rubber  around your dick  and you're trying  to feel like that.  This, at least,  you're feeling  some kind of movement over...  It's not like the...  Like we talked about  the grip jerk  and the slide jerk.  It's more like a slide jerk.  And then the head  of your penis  looks like retarded  because it's all fucking...  You know what I mean?  It's in this big bag.  And it's all messed up, though.  Why would it be messed up?  Because...  How can I explain this?  Because the condom  doesn't give.  So then it's all distorted  when you're done. 
[02:06:30]  Well, when you're done,  no, it's full of jizz.  Yeah, I understand that.  Yeah.  But it keeps pushing  forward, forward, forward.  And then it just  distorts your...  The head of your...  All right.  I'm just trying  to figure it out.  But supposedly they...  But the new ones  are...  They feel really good.  It's called  the Trojan Ecstasy.  That's what they are.  Really?  Trojan Ecstasy.  And maybe we got  a picture of it.  I actually prefer a magnum.  I have to put  packing peanuts in it  so it doesn't fall off.  Oh, you know what? 
[02:07:00]  We blew the bit, by the way.  What?  We should have went  with Dryas Young Vag.  There it is.  Anthony.  Oh, that's a good idea.  Dryas Young Vag  because someone's coming up  Tommy in Bay Ridge.  Amy Winehouse.  Dryas Young Vag.  No, I think she's  fucking always...  That's the way we should  have went with this  fucking little bit of all.  Look, that's what  it looks like.  See?  So the top  is all loosey-goosey  around you.  So then you're  feeling it slide. 
[02:07:30]  I don't know.  That's for people  that use condoms.  Exactly.  I don't know who  these people are.  I don't know what they do.  Yeah.  Tell them you don't  want to see them anymore.  They'll understand.  Believe me.  I have to piss again.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, goodness.  What's wrong with me?  You have a little bladder.  I certainly do.  It's teeny.  We're going to do  the Adam Lambert  kiss thing.  Oh, that was a big story.  But who gives a shit?  No one cares.  What's the big deal  with this?  Hey, look.  Travis is on. 
[02:08:00]  Hi, Travis.  Travis on Channel 11.  Yes.  If he was a man.  If he was a man.  That's Travis  if he was a real man.  Look at that.  He has a great jawline,  doesn't he?  Holy shit.  He sure can grow  a beard, that gentleman.  A perfect beard.  Who is he?  I don't know.  He's in some dumb show.  There's sneakers.  Oh, he's on Heroes.  Oh, he's on Heroes.  Anyone watch Heroes anymore?  No.  No more Heroes?  Why don't we do  the Adam Lambert thing?  So he's on CBS  this morning. 
[02:08:30]  Before his interview,  yeah, this is kind of  interesting.  CBS aired a montage  in which they blurred out  Adam's man-on-man kiss.  Where did he do that?  On the music awards?  American Music Awards.  American Music Awards.  It surprised the shit out of me  that he was gay.  Yeah, who knew?  Wow.  Why would they blur that out,  though?  That is irritating.  Well, hold on.  This is what's going to be  the other side of this.  So they blur out  the Adam Lambert  man-on-man kiss,  but left Britney  and Madonna's  lesbian kiss.  I'm good. 
[02:09:00]  In the montage.  So people are outraged  by that.  Well, he's saying  it's a double standard.  He's right.  That men can't  grab each other  and open-mouth tongue kiss  on stage  on fucking national television.  No.  And women can.  No man wants to see  man-on-man kissing.  No!  I would assume  even gay men  don't want to see  man-on-man kissing.  It's not even about  fucking two women kissing.  I don't care who you are.  You want to see that.  You'll watch.  It shouldn't blur it, though.  You know, it's unpleasant to see.  It happens. 
[02:09:30]  This is what  Lambert said  about the kiss thing.  He's a smart guy,  by the way,  because he's...  Well, he's got  more and more people  talking about him.  He was smart.  He'd try out some pussy.  How fat is that girl  on 11 getting,  by the way?  That might just be  the stretched picture.  No, she had a kid.  Yeah, she had a kid.  She's coming back  from a kid.  What does Adam Lambert  think about all the controversy?  Let's ask him.  Good morning, Adam.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Did you have any idea 
[02:10:00]  your performance at the AMAs  would ignite this firestorm?  No clue.  No clue at all.  You know, I was really  looking forward to it.  I worked really hard  with my dancers  and my band  for about two weeks  putting that together.  And I admit  I did get carried away,  but I don't see  anything wrong with it.  I do see how people  got offended,  and that was not  my intention.  My intention was just  to interpret the lyrics  of my song  and have a good time  up there.  Did you plan  when you were rehearsing,  did you include  those sexually charged  moves in the rehearsal?  Those kind of came 
[02:10:30]  from more of an  impromptu place.  What I did the night before?  No, those were not rehearsed.  Watching milk?  You know, I think ABC was...  Watching milk.  That's called cutting our losses.  Who gives a shit?  Yeah.  God.  Ah, fuck off.  Let's take a break.  Yeah, we got Mad Dog  coming up soon.  He should be here  right after the break.  We'll talk a little  sports, I guess.  Nice.  What are we going to  talk about with him?  I got a bunch of  sports questions.  Give me one. 
[02:11:00]  How tall is Reggie Jackson?  Oh, that's a very good question.  Good one.  Football.  How about that big game?  Which one?  I'll say it on whatever.  The big one.  Damn Jets.  And they won yesterday.  Yeah, but they didn't  cover the spread I had.  Oh.  I had Jets in 30.  Did you?  That's a horrible move, Jimmy.  Who's your bookie?  Ted.  Yes.  Ted's bookie. 
[02:11:30]  Maybe after the break,  Ted the bookie.  Yes.  Oh, that's potential.  It certainly does.  All right, stay there.  That's the theme of this  play, I wonder.  I'm very happy to have  the Mad Dog in studio,  Chris Russo.  What channel are you on, Chase?  Gentlemen.  What channel?  Let's get the channel out.  123, 144, XM.  See, you're in the same  position we are.  197, 202.  It gets a little confusing.  I keep telling the guys  down the hall, 
[02:12:00]  make it one fucking channel.  I'm serious.  Ah, 120.  I know you would like to be.  How are you guys?  Jimmy, how are you, pal?  I'm very good.  I'm doing good.  Good.  Anthony, what's going on with you?  Great.  Opie, have a nice Thanksgiving?  Yes, I did.  Second year.  I didn't know.  I thought it was his first  wedding.  It's his second Thanksgiving.  Yes, second as a family.  I want to, I just celebrated  my one year anniversary.  Good for you.  But every time we talk to the  Mad Dog, he wants to know  about my marriage and stuff.  Which means he must be in hell.  Oh, Jesus. 
[02:12:30]  You have way too many questions.  I do.  I ask you.  I want, when he has the children  and then his life becomes a little  different and he's dancing around  here and there.  You want to say there'd be no more  hockey for you, my friend.  I sent my last, I sent my last  check.  I know, yeah, yeah.  From the divorce.  So that's nice.  Yo, you finished with that, huh?  Yeah, that's that.  That was an easy run for him.  It was easy.  Easy run.  How many years are you married?  He almost went through.  Nine.  Wow.  But he...  No children, right?  No.  Let's put this in terms that he  can understand.  He went through three Olympics  paying her off. 
[02:13:00]  Wow.  Wow.  I can't understand that.  Three Olympics.  Three Olympics.  Was it old school?  Old school.  Three summer?  Was it three?  No.  Oh, three summers.  Oh, wow.  Three summer Olympics.  He was married for the length of  time between the Yankees' last  World Series win and this  World Series win.  That's even better.  Oh, one note.  I like that one better, Jimmy.  Oh, one note.  We got to talk in sports.  Sports talk.  Oh, baby.  Mad Dog does a great show.  I'm a fan.  I listen.  You've always listened.  You've been a good buddy.  Semi-regular.  When I'm in the car, I definitely  make sure I got you on every  single time.  Well, I mean, the bottom line is 
[02:13:30]  I got to find my niche.  You guys have a huge audience.  You've been on for a long time.  You do lots of different things.  Me, I have sports as my theme,  plus I'm solo, plus it's five  hours a day, so that's a long  haul on a day-in, day-out basis.  I got to find my niche.  I got to find that topic.  Do you talk about other stuff  besides sports?  Oh, yeah.  I get into stuff.  I mean, nothing crazy.  I do Tiger.  I mean, I obviously know you  from the Mike and the Mad Dog days,  and when you guys used to go off  sports topics and just talk about 
[02:14:00]  movies or lifestyle, just a little  taste, I liked that.  It was refreshing.  Absolutely.  And then you got back to the sports.  I try to do that as much as I can.  Again, a little harder when you're  solo than when you are with  somebody else.  Yeah, you have somebody to bounce  off.  Right.  I mean, you can sort of get in,  you can drift off.  But I mean, I'm trying to think of,  I'll tell you what I've done.  And I've done 19 book authors  since I've been on.  Jesus.  That's a lot in over a year and a half.  I did have Agassi in studio.  Did you read the books?  Good spot.  That's a big one.  Good spot.  Good book.  Did you read the books?  Yeah, I usually read them. 
[02:14:30]  A couple, like, you know,  Daryl Strawberry's book I didn't  read necessarily.  Jimmy Roberts.  I did read Jimmy Roberts.  The big athlete book I won't read,  but the good sports book I read.  I did read Agassi.  Let's go back to Agassi.  Did you know that was a fucking  hairpiece?  I had no idea.  Really?  You had no idea until...  Not I know about that  crystal meth stuff either,  of course.  No, of course not.  But after the hairpiece thing  came out,  we started looking at old videos  and it's so obvious.  Yeah, I could share...  Which one was it?  The US Open?  It's like a Google video.  It just sticks up there, right? 
[02:15:00]  No, it started pushing upwards  and he had the headband  trying to keep the hairpiece intact.  I tell you,  that is a great book.  I was shocked how good  that book was.  A lot of stuff.  That was a very good tennis book.  It's just an excellent,  excellent book.  Now, I tell you,  who comes across great  in that book  is Steffi Graf.  Really?  I mean, you know,  I'll give you a perfect example.  I mean, this is a weird one,  but I'll give you...  If you can follow the fact  that she's such a...  You know,  she knows what it's like  to be a great player.  One year, 
[02:15:30]  he's playing Federer  at the Open.  It's quarterfinals.  This is probably  about five years ago.  He's renting a house  in Westchester.  Him and Steffi  have got two kids.  Renting a house  in Westchester.  It's a windy,  swirly day,  so there's rumors  that there's going to be  some bad weather.  It's a night match.  She calls the  Albany Weather Bureau.  She's not home.  She's in Westchester.  It's not the match.  To check the weather.  She finds out  from the Albany Weather Bureau,  you've got to sell.  This match is going  to get canceled. 
[02:16:00]  I'm telling you right now,  he's going to be home  earlier than you think.  Da, da, da.  She goes out of her way  to call the Albany Weather Bureau.  He comes home  with his coach,  Darren Cahill,  and she makes sure  the kids are asleep  and she's got  two hot plates of lasagna  sitting on the kitchen table  so when he comes home,  he's got something to eat  because she knows  she's going to have to  finish the match  the next day  so it's a different feeling  about, you know,  you're prepared differently  when you have a day off  and you have a match  the next day.  The fact that Steffi Groff  has got that  straightened out  like that  calls the Albany Weather Bureau  is that she won 19 majors 
[02:16:30]  for God's sake.  I was so impressed by that.  It's that kind of crap.  I was very impressed by her.  She's probably afraid  if she'd do method  and flip the table  like La Mana.  Maybe, yeah.  But, I tell you,  good book, though.  Good book.  Yeah, it's alright, huh?  And he was good in studio.  Yeah.  Yes, he was.  Very open and honest.  30 minutes,  he was good.  Hey, well,  let's get into  the Tiger Woods thing.  Holy, you're going to be  talking about that all day, right?  That'd be a big theme.  I mean, bottom line is  Tiger is not used to this.  Yeah, he's been untouchable 
[02:17:00]  and squeaky clean.  There you go.  Controls everybody.  He dominates.  He lets you know  what he wants you to know.  And sues everybody  if there's wrong info out there.  Has he sued people, really?  Oh, man, he's really  into going all out  with the suing.  Okay.  He can't sue here  because everybody knows  what's going on.  I mean, he's got this  high-profile...  I mean, he's hanging out  with this, you know,  good-looking woman  from Australia  who runs to a huge  high-profile attorney  so she knows  something's going on there  and he gets...  His wife catches him. 
[02:17:30]  He runs out of the house  at 2 o'clock in the morning.  She follows him  with a golf club.  He presses on the gas.  He puts it in reverse.  Hits a fire hydrant  and she smashes the car.  I mean, it's not that difficult  to figure out.  Yeah, yeah.  And, you know,  all the spin-docking  that he wants to do,  private matter,  these are malicious rumors,  it doesn't work.  We all know  what's going on here  and he's not used to  being in a situation  where he's vulnerable.  Yeah.  And now he's vulnerable  and the issue would be  what he does tomorrow.  He's got this tournament  tomorrow in California.  He hasn't canceled yet, right?  He hasn't canceled. 
[02:18:00]  He could still up in the air.  But he could cancel  and say, look,  I'm still kind of  recovering from this thing.  Or he could just go out there  and not talk to the media.  Oh, right.  How's that going to happen?  It looks bad,  but he could do that too.  He's going to shoot 100.  He won't say that.  Knowing him,  he'll go out there  and shoot 65.  I think she attacked him  while he was sleeping.  You think so?  I don't know.  Come on.  His face was pretty, you know.  I guess he had some cuts  on his face  and the bottom line  is you need to talk  to the cops  just to get it out of the way  so it's not lingering.  Yeah, now he's making  this big mystery, 
[02:18:30]  but everybody knows,  like you said,  everybody knows what it is.  Everybody knows what's going on.  What about the part  where he's unconscious?  Unconscious for seven minutes?  I guess his head  hit the windshield  or something.  Oh, really?  I think that maybe did happen.  I think she got one last shot in.  I think she hit him  in the head  with a golf club.  I don't know about that.  One last shot in.  He was flying on the ground.  It's a bad scene.  And how insulting  that it's with his golf.  Golf club.  That paid for the house  and the Escalade  and everything else.  What a panicky Pete he is,  though.  His wife's yelling at him.  He backs you into the tree,  the fire hydrant. 
[02:19:00]  Man up.  I'd yell back at her.  God almighty.  Don't you know who I am?  I'm Tiger Woods.  Shut up.  I mean, he didn't go out for the...  He wasn't going out  for baby wipes  at 2.30 in the morning,  I guarantee you.  No, no, no.  And he's not a drinker,  so it's nothing to do with that.  He's not wrapped up enough.  He's been scandal-free.  Right.  But, you know,  the thing is,  the media,  he talks to the media  and he wants to answer questions  and now the media,  who doesn't,  you know,  I think a lot of media  is sort of down on Tiger,  so now they're going to grapple,  now they're going to really attack him. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  You know,  he's in the deep end of the pool now.  What do you think as far as,  because he's a sweetheart  as far as endorsements go.  You think it affects him at all?  You know,  probably not.  I mean,  do you think it affects him  with endorsements?  They need him more than he needs them.  Yeah, that's true,  you know,  but...  He's the biggest,  he's the most,  he's the biggest athlete in the world.  I guess it might also depend on  how far this goes,  what comes out of it,  if something really weird comes out.  Well, she's not going to leave him.  I mean,  how is she going to,  his father of his two kids, 
[02:20:00]  I mean,  he makes a hundred million,  she's not going to leave,  she's not ever going to leave him.  Well, she gets half  for doing nothing though.  You get the kids,  you get half for doing nothing.  You know,  she's 29 years of age,  with two little kids,  she's used to that Tiger lifestyle,  she's not,  and I guess supposedly,  did you read that,  that he told a buddy of his,  I got to go out there  and buy her  a ten carat.  No,  the Kobe ring,  whatever it's called.  Yeah,  which is basically,  the Kobe house.  The Kobe house,  because it's a,  it's a,  yeah.  It's a house on her finger.  Yeah,  it's a house on her finger basically. 
[02:20:30]  Kobe's ring cost four million.  I know.  Holy shit.  It was a four million dollar ring,  he bought his wife after that.  You screw up.  If you need to buy a four million dollar ring,  you have screwed up.  Well,  Kobe really screwed up,  but she did too.  He did too.  I mean,  he's,  he's,  I mean,  you know,  and this is a,  and she's a homemaker,  she's a homebreaker this one.  I mean,  the one that he was allegedly with.  First off,  she got nailed with her friend,  she said,  I know who she is,  and then as you inquire,  put up two pictures of the two of them partying.  Yeah.  So she's got no credibility whatsoever.  Obviously,  she knows. 
[02:21:00]  Unless those were photos just taken at a party  where they met and they were acting stupid  because they were two girls.  I mean,  it was in Spain.  They went on vacation together.  Oh,  they did.  Okay.  Said she never met her,  never did.  Oh,  she got killed with that.  Why would you lie like that though?  That's like saying you don't know someone,  but there's obviously photos.  She panics.  She panics because she's trying to keep her mouth shut.  Dummy.  She's lovely.  This is a great story though.  You got to admit it.  Oh,  man.  That's a great one.  I mean,  if you're not into the Carolina Jet game,  it helps,  that's for sure.  Fuck the Jets.  That's my team,  you know.  You're not a Jet fan. 
[02:21:30]  No,  I don't have a football team.  I like the baseball teams.  You don't have a team right now?  Not like I used to.  Not like I used to.  Where are you from when you were growing up?  Long Island,  Syosset.  So why aren't you like a Jet fan?  I never got into the Jets.  So when you were growing up,  who did you like?  Green Bay,  Packers,  because I always used to love Lombardi.  So I love the Packers.  You were just confused  because they looked like the Jets.  Yeah.  The colors.  They did.  Close enough.  Green and orange.  Green and yellow.  They are.  You know,  I just did a Lombardi book,  a guy who came in the other day.  The football right now, 
[02:22:00]  listen,  Colts have played great.  You know,  it's the Colts,  Saints,  and Vikings.  And the Saints,  Vikings will be a great championship game  because they both can score.  Both play in domes.  There's no weather issue.  Right.  Favre and Breeze.  That'll be a big game.  Did you know that Brett Favre  still had it in him?  I'm shocked.  He's played this one.  You are shocked,  right?  Absolutely.  I know he was injured  when he was with the Jets.  I'm shocked.  How good he's been.  Unbelievable.  I thought it was a goof  when they signed him.  It's like,  why are you taking this guy?  He took the 398 yards yesterday.  398 yards,  he's 40 years old.  I mean,  and I'm not a Favre fan, 
[02:22:30]  but he's played very well.  Gotta give him credit.  Played great.  He's never won a Super Bowl,  has he?  He's won one.  Oh,  he did win one.  Okay.  He's been in two,  won one.  I was only off by one.  96.  Why don't you dispute him?  Why don't you argue him?  No,  no,  I'm sure he's right.  No,  I think I'm right.  He hasn't won any.  Here's what I just did.  I'm so phony.  I tried to act like I knew  what I was talking about,  but I did it in question form,  so I couldn't be wrong.  If I had any balls,  I would have said he never won one,  but I didn't know,  so I asked.  We did it the last time he was in. 
[02:23:00]  Bad Dog's a rain man  when it comes to this stuff.  Oh,  my God.  Oh,  I like that.  I love that stuff.  I was convinced that you guys  just fucking...  Had the books and stuff.  Yeah,  you Googled your asses.  You know what I'm reading right now  that I'm into?  You guys would be nuts.  Why would I care about this?  I saw it sitting there  on my shelf on Saturday  and I've had it forever.  Happy endings?  No,  no,  no.  You're going to be nuts.  I don't want to deal with this  you're going to say.  But I saw it sitting there  and I have to read it.  They did the big series about it,  that John Adams book.  Oh,  okay.  I know the second...  Why read the book  when you can see the miniseries? 
[02:23:30]  I missed the miniseries.  I hear that miniseries  is great.  Did you ever see it?  Yes,  get the box in.  I did.  I know it was great.  Yeah,  Giamatti did it.  Did you see it?  I did not.  I saw some of it,  but I'm not big on period pieces  even though it was supposed to be great.  I have to go get that now.  I'll have my wife buy it for me  You've got to get a Kindle.  What do you mean Kindle?  Oh my God,  where have you been?  I'm lost.  What is he talking about?  Electric book.  It's an electric book.  Oh no,  electric book.  You Wi-Fi your books  right into your Kindle  and then you just push next page. 
[02:24:00]  It's so blind.  It's great.  No,  it's actually better.  There's no false light on it.  If you want light on it,  you're right.  No,  they figured out the technology  so you could read this shit  in the sun.  It's not like a computer screen.  that's how it works?  Oh God,  you guys with these technologies...  No,  it's great.  You could have ten books in one though.  You could carry all your books  in one thing.  That's what I was saying.  You'd travel a lot still, right?  Look on carpentry.  Yeah.  The barber.  And you got the Heisman this week.  People will be wrapped up in that  because it's close.  You got Florida, Alabama this week.  They'll be wrapped up in that  big college football game.  Is Tebow going to be 
[02:24:30]  a great NFL player?  No, absolutely not.  He's not, right?  No.  Why not?  He's not a pro passer.  You know,  he doesn't sit by...  Would he play in other positions?  A lot of his game is running.  So would he play in other positions?  Well,  he could do that.  He's not going to be a quarterback,  but you know...  Why is it that he's one of the  greatest college quarterbacks  but he's not going to do well  in the NFL?  Because a lot of his game  is running.  Right.  And he can't run in the NFL.  They don't run in the NFL.  I'll tell you what's a big  development yesterday.  It's Vince Young going 99 yards  for the Titans.  Did you guys see that?  Hell no.  They're down 10-6 
[02:25:00]  at the one-yard line  or they're down 13-10  at the one...  No, 17-13  at one-yard line  late in the game.  He went 99 yards  and he scored a touchdown  on fourth down.  Everybody had wondered  if Young could do that  and he did it.  It was a big game for him.  Tennessee's not making a playoff  so it was a big win.  The Lions offense  was very impressive.  Thanks for that.  They're terrible on a level  it's like they should actually  be kicked out of the NFL.  Not a bad team.  Terrible.  Why do we have to watch  the Lions every Thanksgiving?  The tradition.  I'm all for tradition  but come on.  That's a good spot. 
[02:25:30]  I understand that.  That's a good spot  for a real football game.  Well, the mid-30s  they've played it  and jeez.  Everybody moaned and groaned  about why the Raiders  had to play the game  against Dallas.  Right.  What a lousy game  but CBS says  to the NFL  they give them  500 million a year  hold on now  I get two  Cowboy games a year  in Dallas  where they can broadcast  the games  and Dallas this year  plays the AFC West  so there's only two teams  that are visiting Dallas  this year  San Diego  and the Raiders  and CBS says  hold on now 
[02:26:00]  don't give me San Diego  on Thanksgiving  because everybody  watches that day anyway  you put Syosset High School  against the Cowboys  you're going to watch the game  so give me the worst team  and save me San Diego  for later in the year  so that's why you get  the Raiders on Thanksgiving  plus I think the Raiders  had never lost to Dallas  in Dallas  I think there were 3-0  against the Cowboys  not enough games  that's a small sample  yeah I know  I was just happy  that they finally  you know  just that they finally  did it  I know you're really  tearing him up  but I was  he didn't argue my stat though 
[02:26:30]  no  he just said it was shit  it's too small of a sample  I didn't know that  who wins tonight  that's a very good game  Patriots-Saints  I guess you gotta  take the home team  but I would not  that's a very hard game  to predict  I mean the Patriots  obviously can match  him offensively  Belichick against  Drew Brees  you know it's very similar  to the Patriots  Colt game  Patriots should have  won that game easy  obviously  I didn't have a problem  him going for it  and they lost  a heartbreaker  same kind of game  yeah yeah  I was gonna ask you about that  I'm sure you talked about that 
[02:27:00]  for four hours  oh yeah  oh you wondered about  that's up in five hours  everybody can talk about  fourth and two  that's a perfect situation  for me  I need that  Belichick went for it  it didn't get it  right  on his own 28 yard line  yeah  wow what was the score  when he did that  he was up by six  what a pompous ass  how much time is left  2-0-8  but remember  Manning had scored  two quick touchdowns  in the fourth quarter  went right down the field  in a minute  and he knew  if he gave him the ball back  he'd probably do the same thing  so he said  my best player is Brady 
[02:27:30]  let him see if he get  a first down on fourth and two  fourth and two is terrible  especially if he were  on 28 yard line  he didn't make it  so he got pounded for it  even if he made it  that's a dumb move  if he makes it  yeah  he's a hero  game over  they've been discussing  this play for a few years  that's been discussed a lot  that's the sort of thing  I need  to get my channel moving  I like when a coach  has balls to do something  I agree with you  I don't have any problem with it  I agree  but in that situation  it's just a bad move  because you're too close  what was the score  it was 34-28  yeah  six points 
[02:28:00]  yeah but Manning  was unstoppable  see Manning had scored  two touchdowns  in the fourth quarter  right down the field  with 4-7 left  they were down  you kick that fucking ball  and you tell your defense  exactly  I understand that  but I tell you right now  there is nobody  who has any doubt  they would have scored  a touchdown  when Manning gets the ball  at the 40-yard line  he's going to go down  there and score  that's Manning  in a regular season  he does that stuff  not as much in a postseason  what about  you don't talk basketball  much do you  I love basketball 
[02:28:30]  I'm trying to think  if there's anything  interesting right now  the Nets  0-17  the Nets  Byron Lawrence  Frank  they are horrendous  what was the score  last night by the way  1400-9  did they play hard  for the new guy  no  they were down  27 points  in the first half  and then they lost  by 17-18  they got killed  I think they had  86 points  I feel bad for Lawrence  Frank  I feel bad for him  it's not his fault  but hey listen  when you're 0-17  they're going to do  something  someone's head's  going to roll  but they kind of 
[02:29:00]  liked him as a coach  this team sucks  did they move  stadiums  not yet  they're trying  to get to Brooklyn  good job Jimmy  I know that Jay-Z  wanted to buy him  if he didn't buy him  already  they just sold  to a Russian billionaire  he's top 10  in the world  with money  and he's 44 years of age  he just bought  80% of the team  from Ratner  I was slightly off  from Jay-Z  to rich Russian  Jay-Z's in the mix  though  Jay-Z  with Brooklyn  he's in the mix  we were saying earlier  that the Nets 
[02:29:30]  should just lose  every game this season  because that would  make it interesting  instead of them  all of a sudden  being 2-21  who cares  only 21  you're still  paying attention  to this team  how bad  are they going to be  it helps the NBA  that they lose  you're right  everybody likes streaks  this is a good streak  oh LeBron James  does he become  a Nick next year  no I don't  I think he stays  first off  remember the Cavs  can pay him  more than anybody  else can pay him  he understands that  but you know  with his endorsements  and everything else  and he's going to  look bad  if he leaves Akron  he leaves there 
[02:30:00]  without winning  the championship  he's going to have  trouble overcoming that  what about this scenario  they win it this year  then he can feel like  alright I did it  and now I could  I could go to New York  I think you're right  I think there's a better  chance of him leaving  if he wins  than if he loses  didn't Shaquille do that though  didn't he go to LA  had he won in Miami  before he won to Los Angeles  they got to the finals  in Orlando  ok  but remember  at that time  the rule was  that somebody else  could pay you more money  so the Lakers  gave him more money  than the Magic  actually could do 
[02:30:30]  not the same with LeBron  they finally changed it  so your team  could pay the most money  plus remember  so it keeps these guys  you know  where they're at  Shaq's agent was  Leonard Amato  based in Hollywood  LeBron's guys  were all based in Akron  so I think he's going to stay  this Knicks situation  is set up perfectly  for LeBron to come in  though  come on  they have no other  they have the talent  I understand that  I mean he's going to 
[02:31:00]  walk into a situation  with the Knicks  that's almost as bad  right now  as he's with the Cavaliers  and he's not going to  take  see the thing about  the NBA guys  that is stupid  they don't take less money  so there's a cap  in the NBA  so there's only so much  money you can spend  on your team  so LeBron comes in  he takes all the money  and they can't bring  somebody else in  plus the New York  media will kill him  probably a lot worse  than they do in Cleveland  too  the New York media  is funny  LeBron is hard to kill  he's so good  these guys want to play  for a big market  though you've got to think  he makes a ton of money  I mean I don't think  it's a financial situation 
[02:31:30]  if he signs with the Cavaliers  I don't think he goes  long term  he does one or two years  gives it a couple more years  to try to win that championship  I think he wants  a new environment  but if you're LeBron  what advantage do you get  coming to New York  the team is worse  to play in New York City  that's not big enough  how much money can he make  I mean he makes  so much money  I mean he does  every media thing  he's not going to make  any more money media wise  I mean he's got to deal  I mean it's New York  it's Madison Avenue  alright he's a bigger star  if they win  but it's  I mean I don't know 
[02:32:00]  I think he's going to stay  I think he's going to stay  he's already a huge  endorsement guy  he can't make any more  if he wants to make more money  he can't make any more  it's impossible  yeah  so I mean  unless you want to win  in New York  compared to winning  in Cleveland  that's the only enticement  I guess it's more important  to win in Cleveland  if you're LeBron James  and plus if you're LeBron  they've won a championship  since 1964  and they've never won  an NBA championship  so Cleveland there  that would be  you know  he'd be a lifetime hero  this is probably going to go  a little too  inside 
[02:32:30]  but a little too obscure  you see what happened  to Dean Memminger  oh I do  it is obscure  Memminger is a mess  Dean Memminger  played with the Knicks  did he win a championship  with the Knicks  73 second one  he was part of the  73 championship team  well there was a fire  in the Bronx  he may have been on the  first team as a bench guy  I don't remember that  but the second one  he was on a team  played well  he was in there  with the Knicks  when they were winning  championships  and there was a little fire  in the Bronx  in a row home  and rumor has it  there might have been  a crack pipe  that they found  in Dean Memminger's  house 
[02:33:00]  wow  he sounds like he's a mess  he's gone bad  he's gone bad  do you cry watching sports  I get goosebumps  have you  what sports thing  have you cried at  there has to be one  cried  yeah  yeah there's a couple  Federer winning  the French Open  got completely into that  because he completed his  you know he won  I was his last one  he hadn't won  won on all the surfaces  you're a big tennis guy  I like the tennis  I think Jeter's gonna be  named sportsman of the year  a lot of rumors about that  comes out today  tomorrow  I would have given it 
[02:33:30]  to Federer  but I think Jeter will get it  cry  my Giants have never won  so there's nothing  I cry about with them  when a team that I like  wins and there's an  emotional moment  I get into it  do you like when  athletes cry  we love it  it depends on the  it depends  if I deem it phony  or if I deem it real  when Kobe emotes  who I don't love  doesn't mean anything to me  when a guy that I like  gets teary eyed 
[02:34:00]  then I'm okay with it  I think we played this  for you last time  but the Mike Schmidt  I love the Schmidt  can't get enough  to Schmidt  he's such a man's man  how do you not laugh  at that  and he blubbers  you love that Schmidt  god you both of you  love that Schmidt thing  how do you not laugh  at that  so how are you  how do you like  your new digs  it's alright  it's cool  I hated all that room  we had to move around in  this is like nice  nice and small  nice and cozy  small we're here all together  you never want to hear  it's nice and cozy  you get better guests  in here right 
[02:34:30]  because you're with  everybody else  from Sirius XM  you get the occasional guests  that are allowed  to come into our show  yes  we get yelled at  when we grab one  oh really  we still feel like  outsiders  we get blocked  really  completely  oh my god  well you got your own  group of guests  who come in  who just are you guys  anyway right  we feel like outsiders  though  why do you feel like an outsider  because we came from  the XM side  oh I wouldn't feel  like an outsider  I didn't come here either  I came from  Terrestrial Radio  from that wonderful  company CBS  I came from an outsider  I don't feel that way 
[02:35:00]  they were thrilled  to have you here  that you didn't just  like kind of like  you weren't part  of the garage sale  they were thrilled  to bring you in  oh no they love you guys  that's not sure  you guys do well  for this place  they need you guys here  well that's what we think  you could be our agent  did you have a nice  Thanksgiving  oh yes  how about you  did you have a nice  Thanksgiving  yeah I went on vacation  where'd you go  you were off last week  right  all week you guys were off  I went to Disney World  did you really  he loves Disney World  I go to Epcot  I go around the whole lake  and drink at all the 
[02:35:30]  separate little countries  oh I love that stuff  the bars  I love the rides  the one ride I like  is that around the world ride  when they put you  in that little  lower  that seat  where your feet are  off the ground  and you go  no it's a California ride  where you're in California  soaring I think it's called  oh soaring yeah  oh that's a good ride  have you been to that one  you totally feel like  you're flying  oh yeah  it's just scary  you feel like  you're going to pass out  when your feet are dangling  when your feet are off the ground  and you're going over  the Golden Gate Bridge  yeah  oh it's a great ride 
[02:36:00]  it's not  it's all virtual  oh it's great  like on a giant  like almost like  an IMAX screen  oh it's great  are you really moving  or is it just  no the thing  well the thing moves  the thing rocks  to kind of give you  pitch black  oh alright  pitch black  to give you the feelings  of like geez  and stuff like that  and it's about 10 minutes  they go over treetops  where you lift your legs up  yeah you do  you lift your legs up  thinking you know  you're going to actually  hit the trees  and the first thing you are  and you freak out  the first thing you see  lights go out  you're off the ground  is you're in a hang glider 
[02:36:30]  over the Golden Gate Bridge  yeah  oh god  and it feels real  oh it does  it feels real  that'd be fun  oh god  it feels like  and because you're not  in anything  you're really sitting down  you really have the feeling  like you're just flying  oh that's pretty cool  through that  and then they have  different things  that they're  you know like the winter  they have a skier  and you go over  the top of a ski slope  mountain  where you just  miss the top of the mountain  is it a circular screen  like it wraps around you  yeah  wraps around you  oh you absolutely feel like 
[02:37:00]  and you get the noises  the swishing sound  the skiing  it's really good  the wind is blowing on you  and it smells like outside  it's really  oh it's amazing  how they do that  so you did that  so you went with you  last week  you came back  two days ago  yeah I came back  like Wednesday  before Thanksgiving  so I could have  that Thanksgiving  over the family  with the whole family  do that thing  which is great  a lot of wine  and then  and then Saturday night  was pretty much  the last night of vacation  and I knew that 
[02:37:30]  so that was  that was party hard night  which made Sunday  completely useless  piece of crap day  I have no  recollection of Sunday  it was just me  which is yesterday  with a wet rag  on my head  just going  oh  and have you  recovered today  yeah yeah yeah  Saturday you drank  like fucking  Frankie Five Angels  Anthony bounces back fast  do you party there  Russo  yeah I do  I did not  you know I tell you  when you have  children  and they're young 
[02:38:00]  you have to be careful  you take them on vacation  to Disney World  well you care  I've done that  that's work  that's not a vacation  that's very hard  taking them  one of them  needs a stroller  one wants to go  to this ride  one wants to go  to that ride  that's an impossible trip  but when you have kids  and you're at a holiday  you have to be careful  of picking your spots  of when to drink  and when not to drink  because you got to be  on your game  10 o'clock  you got to get  I have a four year old  who's stolen diapers  I got to get him organized  oh man 
[02:38:30]  you got four little kids  one wants to stay here  one wants to stay there  four  and 11 and 10 and under  wow  so from that standpoint  you can't be in a situation  where you're out of it  because you got to be  on top of your game  so you have to pick your spots  they don't understand hangovers  kids don't understand hangovers  they're up at 6 o'clock  in the morning  and your head's pounding  it's very true  you'll learn  you requested a five hour show  they probably said  you want to do three hours  I'll do five  as long as you want to stay  I'll stay  the whole line is  my weekend begins  Monday morning 8 o'clock 
[02:39:00]  that's my little weekend  I was wondered  why dad was like  on Saturdays and Sundays  get away from me  you don't know  you know you come  hey dad  what are you doing  you want to come out  maybe throw the ball around  that is a good example  my 10 year old yesterday  he's 11 next month  tells me  dad at 4.30  he's had a play date  for two days  he went with his cousins  to the Villanova  Holy Cross football game  he has his football out  at yesterday at 4.30  dad let's have a catch  Timmy  I'm not having a catch now 
[02:39:30]  okay  you've been running around  all weekend  I have driven you  from place to place  this that and the other  I'm going to have  a bottle of coke  and I'm going to  watch some football  leave me alone  go do your thing  and then that's it  and then 10 years from now  he's going to say  what a lousy father  he's going to play  Harry Chapin songs  and point at you  baby  that's what you do  but that's why  a guy like me  is in a totally  different scenario  than the guys  I just turned 50  did you guys know that  you're 50 
[02:40:00]  damn  last month  October 18th  I was 50  I remember when  you came to New York  as the young  little fucking  sports guy  I was 28  29 years of age  how old are you  40  40 flurf  44  yes  Anthony how old are you  I think I hit 48  48  Jimmy how old are you  41  I look younger though  right  come on  what else can you 
[02:40:30]  tell me about  the new  I'm curious about  these new digs  compared to that  unbelievable place  on 57th street  it was nice being alone  every so often  we had an audience  we had to bring up  the live studio audience  we were able to  get away with a lot  more stuff  because we didn't have  people right down the hall  looking through the glass  we run our own show  anytime you want to  put some smut up  on the computer  you got to get out  and shut the curtains  and everything  just dumb stuff  bothers us  things like that  what about you  didn't you have a problem  with management  you were yelling 
[02:41:00]  screaming about  a couple weeks ago  what did I have  that was interesting  you had like a two hour  fucking rant about it  oh that was  the PR upstairs  oh you know  we apologized  we apologized to Mushnick  about the fact that  you know  here's what I did  that's what you're missing  I had fired my program director  Steve Torrey  is that what you're referring to  I'd like the Steve Torrey  and I fired them  because of their lack  of knowledge historically  so I fired my whole staff 
[02:41:30]  I went nuts  for about July 4th  this is more  this is about five months ago  yeah that's a while ago  and so I fired everybody  so for three days  this is a  it was late July  this is a big deal  about how I fired everybody  and Mushnick got all bent  out of shape  and so one of our guys  called Mushnick  to apologize to the channel  I said don't worry  what are you doing  all he does is  I mean do we apologize  does he apologize to us  when he's speaking to us  what are they doing  that's what they got  to take to a vet  what are they doing  why would you apologize 
[02:42:00]  to Mushnick or anything  Mushnick  we were concerned about  public relations at that point  not more than that  I'm with you 100%  ugh  and he does  I'm not trying to say  he does  he has every right  and then he writes  great job  good day for radio  seriously  because we happen to  call him up  to apologize  what are we calling up  Mushnick for  to apologize  no reason  that's a trouble  yeah who is he  he's not a  there you go  and that's what  bothered me  that's what I  so that's what  I assume  are you over the Yankees  you're in the World Series  say again  is I bothered by the Yankees 
[02:42:30]  are you over it  oh yeah I'm over it  finally over it  I mean the advantage  that I have is  like I said  the Yankees bought  the World Series  because they did spend  215 million dollars  that's what everyone says  though  but hey listen  they won  that's why they won  you know  30 years from now  you're a Yankee fan right  yeah  you know  huge  every pitch  kind of Yankee fan  I was watching every game  I watched every game  so you were into it  Mets  I know you like the Mets  yeah  poor bastard  Mets  Islanders  no my Islanders are alright  I like this team 
[02:43:00]  I like this Islander team  I think their second half  is going to be great  I think they're going to  surprise a lot of teams  so you really love hockey  good for you  love hockey  way more than baseball  at this point  and way more than basketball  even though the regular season  doesn't mean a lot  it's just  the games are just exciting  I go to all the games  so I'm sitting right there  you go to all the games  I shouldn't say all  I got like half a season  so I go 20-22 games  that's tremendous  and I can't get enough  oh yeah  I see them try  three times a week  and then when they  play the Devils  I go over there  when they're at the Gordon 
[02:43:30]  I'll check them out there  you see 30 games a year  probably not  probably not  because I'll eat some tickets  20 games a year  yeah easy 20  that's damn good  I'll probably do 20 this year  sure  good for you  I don't have that  I mean the Giants  why don't you follow  hockey during the regular season  I've been following  a little bit more this year  I have to in this format  a little bit more  of a national thing  do you feel like  there's an audience  out there for it  those hockey fans are there  as far as sports talk goes  yeah oh absolutely  you know why  because they're very loyal  hockey fans are loyal  to their sport  oh you would get crucified 
[02:44:00]  in the old days  I remember people bitching  oh they moment  you know the Devils  the Devils are winning  and they don't even  talk about it  you guys never talk  about the Devils  and we also covered  their games  so their games  are on our channel  you like the shootout  I do like it  I liked it at first  I can't stand it now  I hate it  why do you hate it now  you do the 5 minute  overtime  and then it takes  them 5-10 minutes  to get the ice ready  for the shootout  just keep playing  the fucking overtime  give me 10 minutes  or after 5 
[02:44:30]  then take another  player off of each team  and really open up  the ice  you could do that  make it a 3-on-3 situation  they do the 4-on-4  into 5 minute overtime  they sure do  they could do it  3 out of 3  I mean I guess  you could do that  and I love the shootout  I thought it was exciting  but then you know  you watch this game  and it's a lot of  they're playing hard  for the entire game  and then it's decided  you need a conclusion  of the game  somehow  you can't play there  forever  yeah but  why not  when we were growing up  because it's regular season  it's not post season  but how cool is that 
[02:45:00]  when we were growing up  all of a sudden  you turn off a game  or whatever  you turn back  and what  they're an hour  into overtime  they didn't do that  in a regular season  they did in a regular season  when we were growing up  for a while  ties  oh boy  ties in the regular season  I can't call  I can't challenge them  to nothing  they had ties  it wasn't  you sure  I mean they may have  had an overtime session  but it wasn't  it wasn't endless  if it ended in a tie  then it was a tie  you're sure  if we go way back  oh yeah definitely  there was always ties  alright  now I don't know 
[02:45:30]  about the length  I don't know how long  the overtime period was  but it wasn't more than  one period  it was one 24 hour period  it sucks  I can't even challenge  your mind  I know  I just know I'll lose  do you miss having a partner  at times I do yeah  are you going to have  another one  well I mean down the road  the budget that we have  I got to make sure  everybody else gets  taken care of  as far as you know  everybody's sort of  got their ducks in a row  and make sure I have  some weekend programming  on everything else  so from that standpoint  it's a situation  where I'm not going to 
[02:46:00]  spend the money  on budget  on me for a host  because I don't  co-host  because right now  I can handle it  down the road  getting a guy in there  wouldn't be such a bad idea  yeah  Torrey's sort of a sidekick  but he's not there  he's only there  doing the updates  so it's a little  different situation  why can't he hang in there  past the updates  well I guess he's also  the program director  so he's got other things  he's got to do  besides just writing  and sometimes he does  come in  yeah I like Torrey  oh he's a good guy  he's a very good guy  you friends with Joe Beningo  yeah well I haven't seen him  for over a couple years  I love Beningo  he's my favorite guy 
[02:46:30]  we were kicked off the radio  I couldn't listen to anything  that reminded me of us  so I just listened to Beningo  scream  3 o'clock in the morning  he's a huge New York  oh that was overnights  I love him in the overnights  no I like Steve Summers  in the overnights  no he was too nice  schmoozing schmoozing  I like Beningo  he wanted to kill himself  every time the Jets lost  he was the greatest  yeah he was good  he loves his Jets  more than he had the team  loves the Jets  what other sports stories  are out there  well you got the college football  the Heisman  you got Alabama Florida  this week  it's sort of a semi-final game  of the PCS championship 
[02:47:00]  you got all the football  I mean you got the Patriots  and Saints tonight  they're both  you know obviously  Saints are 10-0  you have  and you have the Tiger thing  you got the Sportsman of the Year  which is coming out  in the next couple days  you know who the candidates are  are you doing the Clippers thing  where they had to get rid of  their announcers for a day  I didn't mention that too much  I know they mentioned something  I mean I didn't know  I didn't follow that that carefully  you know what here  it wasn't even that bad  it was  no it wasn't that bad  I agree with you  they didn't really make any  you got what he said here  they didn't make anything 
[02:47:30]  really that bad  take the clip with you  have fun  oh you got the Clipper clip  it's really not even  there's nothing to it  I guess  well somebody called in  and moaned and groaned about it  yeah one person  yeah that's it  they actually were surprised  that there was an Iranian  in the NBA I guess  is what it comes down to  yeah I didn't  I remember  I know the details  but I guess there's only one guy  who called in  which surprised me  that's what Jimmy was saying  I tell you  there was one email  I think they got  and they just  and they reacted  when did management  and I understand  being cow-tied advertisers  you have to  because they pay a salary 
[02:48:00]  but when did management  in entertainment in general  become such cowards  where they buckle to one person  when did they ever go  okay look that wasn't  the greatest thing  but it wasn't said maliciously  and then they back the talent  why does that never happen  it's you know  they are not  they're not like us  I mean they work for a team  you know  they need the team  to do well  so they do well  us we just go out there  and do our thing  it's a little different  you and I can say that  and nothing's going to happen to us  they work for the Clippers 
[02:48:30]  there is a player in the league  who's Iranian  I'm sure Stern got involved  and called up  and said let's do something here  so I mean they say  you know what  one lousy game  let's just do it  and let's move on  wait till you hear the clip  there's nothing to it  not that big a deal  yeah  we played it earlier  I mean I will make sure  did you ever get close  to being fired  was your head on the chopping block  ever for something you said  or did  not on the chopping block  I mean I have been fired  but not for anything I said  I mean I've said some crazy stuff  but  I don't remember  I sure have annoyed people  but I don't recall me saying  I remember one time 
[02:49:00]  with North Carolina  when they almost blew that game  to Michigan  that's the game that Weber  called that famous  timeout  and North Carolina  in that game  had a big lead  this is in 92 or 93  so this is 20 years ago  and Dean Smith  had a lot of guys  and he loved to play  he was a puppet  he loved to play  all his guys  and you know  at one point  in the second half  he had five white guys  on the court  and I said 
[02:49:30]  Dean  what are you doing  when you freaking  put Stockhouse  in whoever you had  you know  I mean five white guys  what's going on here  and everybody  got all ticked off  I mean for saying five white  and the five white guys  blew a 30 point lead  and Michigan came back  and that's Dean  fooling out the game  some coaches  don't know how to  leave the game alone  they're winning  let them play  for God's sakes  stay the heck out of the way  Dean Smith couldn't do that  he had five white guys  on the court  and I went crazy  you make a good point  that's a good point  you make funny  you make a good point  to leave  leave the game alone 
[02:50:00]  leave the game alone  people love to overcoach  gee whiz  let them play  they're getting paid  plenty of money  let them do their thing  baseball drives me nuts  that overcoach  I understand  lefty lefty righty righty  oh Girardi  oh my god  but you know  Torrey did it too though  Joe Torrey would do it too  it's like  after Stanton and  Nelson left the Yankees  their bullpen really  started to stink  oh they were terrible  if a guy is mowing down  players  and then you have  a righty coming up  why are you pulling out  a lefty  that's what you think  he can't strike a righty out  they fucking  they rely on the stats  way too heavily  and it stinks  they do 
[02:50:30]  they do by those matchups  because they don't want  to be second guessed  and so as a result  if they  now Girardi got killed  because in one of those  angel games  he took out Dave Robertson  who got in two straight outs  he brings a seven  and single double lose  the game  so he got killed for that  yeah  and he's over managing  matchup  we want it back  you know these guys  they don't want it back  they want an answer  they want to be able to  answer the media  after the game  that they did the proper  thing based on  what the charts tell them  but you can't argue  with the charts  a guy like Rivera  is even better  against lefties  I mean I guess 
[02:51:00]  that's rare  he lets Rivera  no but I'm saying  because he's a closer  but if he wasn't  the closer  I guarantee  they'd pull him  once in a while  and then throw  they throw Rivera  in there  because he's so good  he's unhittable  I mean Rivera  is the best  you think Girardi  is a good coach  manager  you know listen  he wouldn't be  my choice  to manage my team  but I can't argue  with the fact  they won a world  championship  he got better  his second year  I also think  to be honest with you  any team  could have won  with this team  the Yankees  are so freaking good  I mean come on  they got a 
[02:51:30]  Hall of Fame  third baseman  they got a  Hall of Fame  shortstop  they got a  Hall of Fame  closer  they got an  excellent first  baseman  who may not  be a Hall of Famer  but he's very  very good  they got Sabathia  he's very good  defensive  and they got  Sabathia there  who's got  I mean they got  a lot of Hall of Famers  on their team  so Yankees are too good  what do you think  of though  who the fuck  won MVP  that guy from the Twins  they had to give it to him  now he's a catcher  he had a great year  he almost hit 375  he had to win the MVP  I don't have a problem  he had to win the MVP 
[02:52:00]  you know that's where  Jeter  I don't know  because yeah Jeter  and Tashara  yeah  and don't forget  they're going to vote  against the New York team  they don't like to vote  any of your guys  and plus there's two Yankees  so you kind of  split the vote  so that's an issue  that's true  yeah  okay  I was happy  Linsicum won  his second straight  Cy Young  that surprised me  I'm a Giant fan  and he won his second straight  Cy Young  which shocked the heck out of me  so why are you a Giants fan  if you grew up on Long Island  well because I met him  when I was a little kid  1968 
[02:52:30]  you met the Giants  yeah at a hotel  and put it up  they got all their autographs  Maze, McCovey  I didn't get Maze's  but McCovey  and Juan Marichal  all these old great Giants  in 1968  I was 8 years old  why'd you snuck Maze  you know what I did  we all ran after  William Maze  running to the ballpark  down at a cab  and he wouldn't sign  anybody's autographs  oh wow  in 1968  8 years old kid  you know in the lobby  of a hotel  Willie comes downstairs  2 o'clock in the afternoon  to run to his ball game  and he wouldn't stop  to sign anybody's autographs  never forget it  have you met him since then 
[02:53:00]  no I have not  why don't you get him  on the show  get him to sign something  and then just scream at him  you can't get this guy  you can't  maybe you can't get them on  if he has a book out  if he's promoting something  me pick up the phone  Willie can you come on  you know another good point  my dad went on a business trip  and got me a twins  pennant  little dumb little thing  hung it up in my room  and became a Minnesota  Twins fan  for a couple years  Minnesota Twins fan  that's basically it  I mean not enough  to get rid of my Mets  but also I'm like  yeah I'm into the Twins 
[02:53:30]  because I got this  dumb pennant from my dad  will you watch the Mets  games  beginning of the year  or you watch every game  no  I'm out  I couldn't even name  their lineup  it may  you can't  you won't watch it  right now  if there was a gun to my head  I couldn't name the starting  lineup of the Mets  this past year  well you know  the third basins  you know Reyes  you know Wright  you know Beltran  yeah I know the basics  you know who the second  baseman is don't you  no  Castillo  no  okay  I'm out  I'm out in baseball  yeah now you're down on it  can you name me the third  line of the Islanders 
[02:54:00]  third line  third line  no  no  I don't know what the  third line is in hockey  yeah I get confused  with all the lines  because they're coming  but you can name  ten Islander players  oh easily  easily  Molson is a great  pickup by the Islanders  so look at this  he's on top of it  with the Isles  my god  easily yeah  I can name just about  all of them  come on  Billy Smith  Billy Smith  still playing  very good aunt  do you  do you have a lot  of spot breaks  on your thing  what do you got  with the commercial  load here  you only have  12 minutes an hour  13 minutes an hour 
[02:54:30]  what do you guys have  you put filler in  we have a couple  of these  every couple of breaks  and we make believe  a bit's really important  that needs to be replayed  do you do bits  do you do a lot  of bits that you  not as much  as we used to  you know  I mean do you record  bits after the show  and then play back  after the show  record the run  to the elevator  yes  which is a  it's a daily  like a soap opera  so 10.05  you guys are gone  10.05  he's on the LIE  I'm on the train  and he's home  we got Lewis Black 
[02:55:00]  coming in  10.30  we'll be out of here  by 10.30  10.30  10.30 is about the time  more or less  10.30  more or less  usually less  let me go run  and do my guys  for a couple minutes  you mind  I think we did  no problem  oh you blew off  your own morning show  to do us  absolutely  let me give him  two minutes  Jimmy good to see you pal  you see  there he goes  Ant  you're the best  great seeing you buddy  what channel again  is Chris on  123-144 
[02:55:30]  Chris Russo  very entertaining  and I really think  the most knowledgeable  sports guy  and just fun to listen to  because he's a fucking lunatic  I love listening to him  when he starts screaming  and yelling  and ranting  and raving  it's great  the story of how he got  into radio  is hysterical too  and just you know  some young whippersnapper  he was young  when he came to New York  he's 50 now  full of piss and vinegar  all that energy  he still is  I know  it's amazing  but that's the type of person  I want to hear talk about sports  I hate guys  like Francesco's not bad  at what he does  he knows a lot  but I just  I can't get into anybody 
[02:56:00]  who talks about anything  like this dog  I don't want to hear it like that  I want to hear a guy  yelling  and that's genuine him  yes  that guy is in love  with sports  it bugs me  Jesus  I was always  team mad dog  always  everybody is  you have to be  you think  of course  Francesca probably was  I'm boring  I think Louis Black is here  we'll talk to him next  stay there  when I was a kid  Halloween  was Halloween  and Santa 
[02:56:30]  wasn't poking his ass  into it  and Thanksgiving  hold on to your hats  kids  you're not going to believe this  Thanksgiving  was it's own holiday  imagine  huh  it was a totally different time  we celebrated something  totally differently  ask your parents  they won't  they won't remember  they'll go  well it had to do  with Protestants  and Indians 
[02:57:00]  and that's  really  when we invented  gambling  and the buffet  and the buffet  turkey and ham  roast beef  was an afterthought  that came much later  and then  much much later  came the  extraordinary concept  of coleslaw  and jello  in a fish mold  what the fuck 
[02:57:30]  is the matter  with somebody  when they think  that'll be appetizing  how shitfaced  would you have had  your beer  what the fuck's left  I feel like  eating some more  oh that yellow jello  and that coleslaw  and the fish mold  boy that's going to  make my day  I'm smacking my lips  just thinking about it  when I was a kid 
[02:58:00]  Thanksgiving was the day  that the family  gathered together  and ate  and drank  and passed out  and nobody woke us up  and said  let's go shopping  because Thanksgiving  is no longer Thanksgiving  just call it what it is  Christmas halftime  and on Friday  on that Friday 
[02:58:30]  following Thanksgiving  you can go to any place  in America  and nobody's at home  they're all at the mall  some of them have been  at the mall  since the day before  intense and stuff  so I can get that  new Barbie doll  that shits candy  in your hand  it's not even  for my kid  everybody's at the mall  everybody's shopping  and there's no news  the only news  is about people shopping  every reporter's  at the mall  going  did you buy shit 
[02:59:00]  did you buy shit  did you buy shit  did you buy  get back in there  buy shit  America's depending  on you to buy shit  today  and then that night  that's the lead story  holy fuck  nobody wants shit  today  we're fucked  we're fucked  stuck up on food  I don't think  we'll make it  until Thursday  and while we're  on the subject  of Christmas  may I  may I just 
[02:59:30]  take a moment  and  and say  that I  firmly believe  that  the Christmas  holiday  is by far  the most  beautiful  of all the  holidays  that we celebrate  there's  there's really  nothing  quite like  Christmas  and as a friend  of the Christian  community  and I truly am 
[03:00:00]  I love you  fuckers  if I could just  offer  a moment  of constructive  criticism  and tell you  you're fucking  it up  and if you  can't  take care  of your own  holiday  lend it to us  Jews  and we'll  take care  of it for you  okay 
[03:00:30]  we got a lot  of extra time  around Hanukkah  so don't you  worry about  a thing  because you  are fucking  it up  it's unbelievable  to me  when does Christmas  start now  you know when  July 7th  there's already  Christmas shit  in stores  what the fuck  how long  does it take  you people  to shop  I've been 
[03:01:00]  all over the  country  there are  stores  that sell  Christmas shit  all year round  that's all  they sell  you explain  to me  how the fuck  they survive  how does  somebody  walk into  a bank  and go  you know  I'd like  a loan  I'm gonna  have a store  and I'm just  gonna sell  Christmas shit  and the banker  goes  what a great  idea  they'll be  pouring it  I believe  that a  store that  sells Christmas  things all 
[03:01:30]  year round  should be a  psychological  way station  someone comes  in in August  and looks  for sleigh bells  you go  you have to  see a doctor  now  and if they  have a gun  permit  you revoke  it  you revoke  it  because they  are seconds  away from  snapping  very happy  to say that  Louis Black  is in our  studio  a very old  friend of ours 
[03:02:00]  started doing  the show years  and years ago  called an old  friend  I don't mean it  like that  a very old  friend of ours  extremely old  decrepit friend  of ours  getting older  by the minute  and we caught up  with him  so I don't even  know what to  talk to him  about  because we  talked to him  about everything  we wanted to  before we got  back on the radio  we're done  I'm sorry you  missed  go to our  website  I was telling  Louis those  commercials he  does  I don't even  know what it's  for  I know  that's the  best part  I guess it's  some vacation  spot  it's commercials

[03:06:30]  15  you get on the plane  I've watched it  constantly  they look up  at the first one  what number  do you think it is  you think it starts  at 30  fuck  yeah where's the other  half of the plane  dummy  really  it's just beyond  oh yeah  you got lucky  then they look down  at their number  like it's gonna change  you're in the back  schmuck  and then they forget  their number  so they gotta look  back down at it  and getting out  of the plane  is the same thing  they sit there  it's a ritual  to pull that 
[03:07:00]  friggin carry on out  they're blocking  the whole aisle  there's no one else  in front of them  the plane's empty  the pilots are gone  I'm surprised  that's where I figure  I'm gonna die  is waiting around  for those schmucks  to move  you know what I love  doing  if I'm in first class  and I see somebody  put their bag  in the overhead  then go back to coach  I love telling them  the stewardess  like that guy's in coach  who put his bag up there  and then she has to  shame him  and fucking chase him down  here you are  average scum  that's a good one  a fancy gentleman  saw you depositing this 
[03:07:30]  instead of having  a cocktail up front  just ratted you out  sipping my tomato juice  hoping that they  don't make eye contact  as they fucking  slither like worms  into the back  yeah my other favorite  is that  and you must go through  this because you  travel a lot  is you go through  Newark  I go through Newark  all the time  yeah  look half of the TSA  knows me now  so it's like  really we're gonna  do this again  hey Lewis how you doing  you know  you're not looking  at the bags anymore  wait  you know what I did 
[03:08:00]  I got to this point  in my career  so I could kill myself  on a plane  schmucks  they know you do  they know me  hi how you doing  what are you gonna be  on TV  hi  Lewis Black  Muslim extremist  how are you  there's one TSA guy  that when he sees me  he goes hello Mr. Sheckler  is he funny  really  yeah  Mr. Sheckler  yeah  Mr. Sheckler  yeah Ted Sheckler  Francine  Francine doesn't know  poor Francine  yeah Francine's here  it's her birthday  it's her 30th birthday  remember when Francine  was like 20 
[03:08:30]  that means we gotta  throw her out today  yep  this is officially  your last day  last day  that you're allowed  to come in  or it could be mentally  she still has 20 years  left of coming in  that's true  you're what they call  over the hill now  yeah  no longer age appropriate  you hit the wall  as they say  see 30  is that magic age  where guys go  I want someone younger  I beg to differ  well maybe your ass  is younger 
[03:09:00]  you wanna show us  your ass  and then we'll decide  if you have a 30 year old  ass or not  that is a good point  that's a very good point  if you think about it  I can wear a thong  so next time  I promise  well you can  you can make believe  you got  what do you got on  anything under there  awful panties  no I have on  awful panties  alright so make it  into a thong  yeah  they're funny  those awful panties  no I do have a great ass  though seriously  let's see  let's see your ass  I mean you're 30  but let's see how old  your ass is  and we'll be honest too  come on  you know we'll be honest  Lou  yeah  for you  we've known you  for so long  we've known you

[03:10:00]  I really think so  I really think so  that's a real badge of honor  in the community  thank you Anthony  no problem  that's a compliment  don't you understand  oh yeah no  boy do I understand  a raging racist  like me  that is a compliment  and a half  like fucking  like Brad Dourif  in Mississippi Burning  he's looking at his baby  being held by a black woman  they're so cute  and they're young  aren't they 
[03:10:30]  feeling all guilty  either that or like  like Ray Fiennes  in uh  in Schindler's List  when he goes down  says you almost had me  almost kind of  he just beats the shit  out of her  he wanted to fuck  Helen badly  oh dude  he wanted her bad  and he was so guilt ridden  by really being attracted  to that Jew  and he was saying  like I would never  let them get you  I would just kill you first  like you're trying  to make her feel better  I would take you  in the woods  and shoot you myself  I pardon you  pardon you  let's go to Eric  in New Mexico  of all places  Eric  hey 
[03:11:00]  morning boys  Louis Black in studio  yes  hey  I saw both of your  specials yesterday  the history of the joke  and the holiday one  first off  on the history of the joke  fucking Bob Kelly  should be shot  he was beyond creepy  you could just stop  with Bob Kelly  should be shot  we all agree  and the holiday segment  with Ron White  you sitting down  with him  and him being  the poster boy  for all that's wrong  during the holidays  had me rolling 
[03:11:30]  yeah that was good  that was  he was really dead on  and brought all the stuff  he was working with props  he was like  Carrot Top  yeah  that's what had me rolling  was him pulling the props  out of his bag  and then when he pulls out  the bong  I'm like  oh my god  and it's true  that's Ron  yeah Ron  I did something  on Comedy Central  with him  believe it or not  and he was so mad  they wouldn't let him  smoke his cigar  he's a fucking animal  he's unbelievable  is he really an animal  an animal 
[03:12:00]  he just drinks and smokes  yeah  he can really put it down  well right on Eric  Louis has got a new special  we should at least  like promote that  a little bit  oh yeah I'm supposed to  because they'll yell at me  so I apologize  that's the only reason  you're here obviously  no I'm not here  because of that  you never come by  just to say hi anymore  this is why I don't come by  I was here  just so you know  out there in New Mexico  I was here  when nobody would come in  and they actually  had a ham radio service  that is  alright  when no one would come  to see them  I would roll in 
[03:12:30]  could you come Louis  yeah I'll come  what does that say  I'll be there  oh well it said  that you know  we were both  trying to get out  of the sewer  there's no denying  that  it was fun  we had a good time  we had a great time  but you got a new special  I've got a special  that'll be out  on a new network  called Epix  which if you can find it  they'll probably send you a check  I don't know about this  Epix  Epix is a new  like an HBO  Showtime  they'll have movies 
[03:13:00]  the first two comedy specials  are mine  and Eddie Izzard  ok  wow  they're doing a special too  about Sam Kinison  they're doing a documentary  kind of a piece  I want to see that  and then  and it's on  right now  it's only on  that I know  of Verizon Fios  so  but eventually  it's going to hit  supposedly  that's what they tell me  it'll be on every table  they told you that  of course they did  we've heard those stories 
[03:13:30]  over the years  what about the one in Boston  no we're going to get  a bigger  we're going to get  a bigger stick  and you're going to be  heard all over  New England  yeah yeah  it's going to be  heard that one  no more static  yes siri  but it's  you know  it'll be cheaper  the whole thing  right  well that sounds good  yeah you and Eddie Izzard  I mean they're both  these big comics  they got specials from  yep  she's eating a banana  I just got  I just got distracted  that is completely wrong  watching Francine  actually deep throat 
[03:14:00]  a banana  it was pretty good  your technique  is the badge  holding up Francine  I was supposed to be  deep throwing a dick  last night but  what happened  what happened  I got hung over  I was  I had a headache  so I couldn't get  to Brooklyn  to get to my sex buddy  it was really bad  Brooklyn  yeah I didn't bring  in my birthday  with some good sex  which kind of sucked  oh  black guy  I haven't been able  to find a white guy  lately  what the fuck  they're all over the place  they like Asians now  so  what  yeah  is that what the deal is 
[03:14:30]  it's been like that forever  what if you  if a white guy  is going out of  just whiteness  it's Asian  yeah  I see a lot more  white  black couples around  usually it's black guys  white girls  but the  exactly  yeah yeah  she's right  about the Asian thing  white guys love Asian tricks  there's a lot of that going on  do this with your eyes  well there's more in  let's see if you can  there's more of them  coming over  they are  Louis could she pass her  yeah but I'm not Asian enough  you look like very  tan Asian  really 
[03:15:00]  yeah  you look spectacular  let's get  I mean really  I don't  really seriously  you could be a fruitsicle  I don't give a shit  I'm serious  I mean  what  how do people pick  by race now  yeah  yeah  well you are  are you who too  I'm Tootsie  you're Tootsie  she's a Tootsie  she's a Tootsie  yeah  you can tell  look at her  yeah  it's the longer  thinner arms  and fingers  and stuff  yeah  I keep talking  it's great 
[03:15:30]  buddy  what documentary  have you watched  recently  Jimmy the Greeks  she's an obvious  she's an obvious  he told us all  what it was about  Jimmy the Greeks  Jimmy the Greek  reference  yeah  yeah yeah  see  they talked about that  and the colonists  the people that were colonizing  had really started  some shit  between the two  by saying that  one was superior  to the other  and we are  see  and it stuck  and that's why  there was mass genocide 
[03:16:00]  going on in Rwanda  way to take the sexy  out of the segment  Jimmy lost his heart  on it  yeah really  it was great for a while  I thought it was getting sexy  get the kid  the genocide  Jesus  what we need  now is Don Cheadle  crying  are the Tutsis  really number one  yep  and who's the worst  I can't really say it  it's politically incorrect  just say it  you might as well 
[03:16:30]  oh come on you guys  let's just make believe  we're not on the radio  who would it be  South Africans  uh  Kenyans  Kenyans are cool  if they were still around  Somalians  Somalians  which would  okay we'll say the Somalians  no who would you say  you had one  well who are the best  the worst  why are you holding back now  cause you're 30  that's not cool  we're not trying to start  any more wars  oh look at what happened to her  she turns 30  and she's all like  that's what I would say anything  that's what happens  you talked about 
[03:17:00]  when you're fucking  when you miscarried  into a toilet  and started laughing  come on  that was hilarious  it is one of the  greatest moments  ever on the show  let's be honest with you  we might have to replay that  one of the greatest moments  of my life  I don't doubt it  it was minus $200  if I had to fucking  get an abortion  yeah  and I didn't have any money  and I was working  at Burger King  that fucking shit  coming out of me  was a lifesaver  that's good  I walked out of there  feeling so good 
[03:17:30]  like yeah  so you're into  Obama's health  health care plan  uh  I think it's a good idea  however  it's not at a good time  uh there's no money  and  really and truly  I think we should just  try to get jobs back  and just  let the  people who have stuff  just die for now  wow  well after the miscarriage thing  we can move right into this  up until the very end  it sounded like  this is a good point  yeah really  you would just  the wheels fell off 
[03:18:00]  what a good point  she's retarded  but there's no jobs  she blew an axle  on that one  dear  there are no jobs  yeah there are no jobs  45,000 people a year die  because there's not health care  got it  more than you die in a war  okay get a grip  so it should be more people  that die without health care  yes  get a grip on it  but then get the jobs back first  yeah  so they're thinking  so that what  but if there are no jobs  people are not going to eat 
[03:18:30]  would you rather eat  or have people die  do we go into Afghanistan too  no you should pull out  but then they're just going to  continue going crazy over there  yeah well  I'll tell you  the Iranians are going to take over  if they leave Afghanistan  or is it Iraq  whatever  there we go  same shit  I can't believe I'm arguing  I got my money on Francine so far  yeah  Lois you're not making any good points yet  I listen to NPR every day now  yeah  okay  yeah  perfect  let her run it  she listens to NPR Lois  all fucking day  and then C-SPAN  I go outside 
[03:19:00]  that's all I see  NPR  yeah  oh my god  I'm really knowledgeable now  about everything  really  like what  because Lois is here  he's a knowledgeable man  I say we hold off on the health care  why  well we're already in the middle of it  yeah we're about to get it  but like  come and explain health care  it's fairly simple  this is what we're going to do  okay  because it's never going to get better  because we're idiots  alright  that's the basic  no we're the best  we are  really  yeah 
[03:19:30]  what planet  we're the best  everybody else  in the whole world  what  better than the French  and the Brits  really  America's the best  have you been to those other places  yes I have  I've been there  oh shit  and they suck  look at what they're saying now  when you're talking about  you know  we should just pull out  of Afghanistan  they're saying  they wish your dad  had pulled out  that would just get ugly  I was in an accident  and I was already told that  and I'm good with it 
[03:20:00]  oh really  yes  they had to tell you that  yeah  why would they tell you that  why not  it's the truth  wow  why would they tell you  by the way Lewis  thank you  Kevin from Connecticut  yes I have to remind you  that she is a college graduate  too  yes  that is correct  well I didn't  what did I say  so she knows her shit  why don't give a shit  is America the greatest place  I want to hear  no  I want to hear  Lewis' take on health care  it's fairly simple  alright  what we have right now  in terms of health care  in this country 
[03:20:30]  is a pile of shit  ok  it stinks  alright  and what they're going to do  oh yeah it does  I had health care  it was really good  well congratulations  you had health care  you're sitting over a toilet  having a miscarry  don't tell me you had health care  who's your health care  you son of a bitch  shitting out your baby  that's because I didn't want my mom  to know I was 17  otherwise I would have gotten my free abortion  thank you  not your free abortion  whatever  it's $250 at the free clinic 
[03:21:00]  I was going to go to the clinic  whatever those clinics are called  Lewis says it's a pile of shit  I want to hear more  it is a pile of shit  I have three health insurance companies  and all they do  literally all they do  is argue  over who's going to pay my bill  ok I had a colonoscopy  because that's what you're supposed to have  when you turn this age  oh you've got a lot to look forward to  I hope I don't have to get one  oh you're going to have to get one  and by then  they're going to do it  with a larger thing  I've got a probe for you  yeah  they're going to say  the small one isn't big enough  that's what the next 
[03:21:30]  but it took them a year  to pay that off  like I asked to do it  like I said  you know I could go to the Aruba  this week  but what I'd really like to do  is shove a submarine up my ass  so would one of you guys  pay for it  but now did that affect you in any way  the colonoscopy  no no  I'm sure that's it  yes  he came on his leg  he made comfies  like the doctor  and the insurance companies  duking it out  did that affect you in any way  aside from getting  an occasional letter 
[03:22:00]  you weren't liable for it  you know what affected me  was the fact  that money was going  to these guys  having a discussion  over my ass  ok  that's what affected me  I'm not paying them  to talk to each other  I'm paying them  here's what you do  colonoscopy  write a check  shut up  do the next check  you stupid piece of shit  I agree with that  but you have a pile of shit  you have a basic pile of shit  insurance  and what they're doing now  is they're going to turn it  into a different pile of shit  and they'll say 
[03:22:30]  oh but you know  what's the difference  what the difference is  is this  the shit we're going to have  will smell different  it'll be a different  pungent odor  but that's all  but in essence  it's the same pile of shit  that they're rearranging  this will be elk shit  I think it's going to  cost more  this shit though  no  you don't think so  nope  then what is this  estimate that they've come up  it's already  it's going to cost more  because we're paying  for some people  to have insurance  but I don't want to 
[03:23:00]  pay for them  well then  and neither do I  Anthony  I can't argue with that  I mean I seriously can't  I was thinking about  the argument you've had  and it's really like  I love yelling at you  but it's also  reached the point  of it  you can't  you can't argue  with a guy that is  blatantly honest  you don't give a shit  about anyone else  no but what I like  is you just say it  as opposed to those guys  in congress who go  well you know  and you're saying  they're saying  okay fuck them 
[03:23:30]  yeah  you know  but you just say fuck them  and I can buy fuck them  that's simple  it's to the point  do you think it's a coincidence  that with all the health care  talk going on  and them trying to get this passed  that all of a sudden  the government comes out  with these new  when women should get  pap smears  and mammograms  and they're saying  well you can put it off now  you can put it off  do you see this as tied in  in some way shape or form  that the government is saying  look 
[03:24:00]  now that we're going to have to  pay for some of this shit  we're going to make people  just kind of cut back  and not get as many tests  and do this  and that  I know you do  definitely  yes  I know  because it's not  because when a fetus  falls out of her vagina  because basically  I love pap smears  I had one the other day  why do you love them  with a paint roller  it's fun  it's uncomfortable  it's like  getting raped by the doctor  but not really  and they put that  light flashlight in there 
[03:24:30]  and then they stick  your fingers inside  does this hurt  it's great  she rules  wow  how do you not have  your own show  Francine  it's unbelievable  she rules  I had my first pap smear  when I was 14  yeah  you liked it  it wasn't bad  I'd already had sex  I was like  well this is kind of like  you know  they put that metal thing  in the speculum  the clam  clap clap clap clap  and it opens up  yeah  and then they put this thing  inside and it goes  click click 
[03:25:00]  and you just feel it  like  just rotating  and doing funny stuff  inside of you  yeah  I've always liked  pap smears  since then  she's the greatest  you should shut up  Lewis  Lewis doesn't know  what to do with that  she likes pap smears  I love it  well you know  really seriously  you ought to have  your own medical channel  Lewis why didn't you  like the colonoscopy  well I actually liked it  it was the best sleep  I've ever had  oh yeah  you had the propofol  they knocked me  totally out  little propofol 
[03:25:30]  the shit that knocked out  Jackson  I said the only thing  that I'm upset about  is that I  when I found out  that Michael Jackson  had the anesthesiologist  come to his house  every night  I never knew  it was an option  I didn't know  you could just call him up  and have him knock you  the fuck out  get a good night's sleep  yeah  finally  finally  that's scary though  didn't they used to  give those colonoscopies  without anything  like they would just  give you like a  gel or something  oh no there's that  sigmoidoscopy  what the fuck is that  where they just send  a half missile  and give you a shot 
[03:26:00]  oh yeah  yeah  and that's no fun  I want to get a colonoscopy  you do  well okay  alright  actually I'm giving them  away at the compound  this evening  we can work that out  feel free to come over  my anesthesia is called  Guinness  on tap downstairs  and the probe is  why don't you go home  it's not as mechanical  as it is organic  go home with Anthony  today Francine  let's have a baby  Anthony  oh what 
[03:26:30]  you want to have  a baby now  yeah I think  I need a baby  in two years  I think I want to  have one  in two years  yeah because I'm  still having fun  alright so we can  just fuck around  for like 12 months  or so  it'll be 24 months  because that's two years  yep  well no you would have  yeah but then  you'd have to  nine year gestation  period  to grow some shit  inside  nine months  nine year  what is your cicada  yes you locust  Francine 
[03:27:00]  show Louis how smart  you are  a little more knowledge  for Louis  I think you're surprising  him today  surprise isn't the word  well give me the topic  and I'll give you  like  alright Louis  that's fair  because I am really smart  what do you think  about the Afghanistan  what do we do there  I think it's just  a horrible mess  we need to send  like 100,000 troops  to Afghanistan  kill out the Taliban  and just give  Hamid Karzai  like  a billion dollars 
[03:27:30]  and be like  dude you're on your own now  that's a good plan  hi Louis  secretary of state  right there  there she is  what do you think Louis  that works for me  that's good  that was a really good plan  I like it  a bunch of people  my plan  get him into her  get him into her plumbing  take all the troops out  you don't fight  people who don't have  indoor plumbing  okay you don't  people who like  the smell of their own shit  are people you fear  the other thing  you could do  is you could find  Bin Laden  everybody says  he's in Pakistan  anyway 
[03:28:00]  go to Pakistan  find Aladdin  Bin Laden  oh I thought  you meant Aladdin  like a magic lamp  and just make this  all disappear  I got a question  for her next  go ahead  finish that  so you find  Bin Laden in Pakistan  and the war  ends right there  you won't even  have to do anything  in Afghanistan  anymore  because  Bin Laden's  who we're really  afraid of  is this a Star Trek  episode where he's  the head robot  and when you kill him  they all go  yeah exactly  you're still gonna get  people that hate  America  no no no  once you kill  Bin Laden  you kill the fear  yeah 
[03:28:30]  I think so  he's the answer  to our problem  we almost had him  too  that story came out  over a break  huh  yeah  well if they don't  get him  that means that  it's just a fake  how close  how close were we  Louis  pretty close  we were like  moments away  moments away  and how did he  get away  it was 2001  was it  it was right  off the bat  well then that's  Bush's fault  then  alright  I got a question  for you  Disney  the black princess  we were talking  about this earlier  what's your thoughts  on the black princess  kissing a frog  and turning into a frog 
[03:29:00]  I'm really  excited about it  however  however  they said that  the prince is white  right  yeah  I think so  that's what I saw  if it wasn't  Louisiana  I wouldn't feel  like weird  about it  and I know  they have that  crazy mix up  like thing  going on down there  but I was like  I thought it was  a good idea  for a start  even if she does  turn into a frog  because then she's  going to turn back  into a princess  right  apparently  yeah  I hope so  but she'll always  be black  yeah 
[03:29:30]  and what's wrong  with being black  nothing  okay  black is beautiful  that's right  especially if you're  Tootsie  is the black  princess a Tootsie  yeah  she looks  kind of looks  like a young  Francine  it does  that's Francine  before she  hit 30  no you guys  no she wouldn't  be Tootsie  we look a specific  way  he looks gay  yes  he looks like  Los Frutos  every like 
[03:30:00]  Disney leading  guy  cartoon guy  looks a little  swishy  yeah don't they  what's the look  of the Tootsie  what's your  features  well actually  they just look  like  they're tall  thin  and they have  big eyes  and small  noses  yeah  yeah small  it's just like  a really nice  it's almost  Ethiopian  like kind of  Somali look  like you think  of Iman  that's what a lot  of my mom's  friends look like  oh really  yeah 
[03:30:30]  I could think  of her  she's a great  actress  you ever see  it on No Way  Out  she's a model  she's not  she was in No Way  Out  she was terrific  yes she was  she overacted  every scene  oh she's mad  he's like  oh she's stunk  he's like  I could have you  on the first  plane back to  Johannesburg  I have a feeling  you don't want to  go  and she goes  you gets right  she's terrible  we got some  comments  Steve on Long  Island  Steve  we got  Louis Black  in studio  and Francine
