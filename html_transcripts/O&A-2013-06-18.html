<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the usual vulgar banter between Opie, Anthony, and Little Jimmy. Opie’s back and shoulder injuries led to a discussion about a teeter inversion table, followed by complaints about Brooklyn traffic and humorous anecdotes about celebrity look-alike requests.  A major topic was the firing of three DJs from "Mayhem in the A.M." for a joke about Steve Gleason, prompting a debate about the appropriateness of the joke, the station's over-the-top apology, and the inconsistent handling of offensive humor in the media.  The conversation touched upon various other subjects including the size of a CNN anchor, medical paperwork, passwords, and the changing landscape of radio and free speech. A Canadian caller offered a different perspective on medical record handling. The segment concluded with reflections on free speech, corporate control, and navigating offensive humor.

The show then moved on to the controversy surrounding Lil Wayne stepping on an American flag in a music video, debating whether it was artistic expression or attention-seeking.  This transitioned into a long-running comedic bit involving a phone call with "Lady Di," a caller known for her unemployment, alcohol consumption, and chaotic lifestyle.  The hosts teased her relentlessly about her situation, revealing details from past calls.  Joe Piscopo unexpectedly called in to promote the show.  The segment also included an audio clip of a passenger's racist and offensive meltdown on a flight,  mentions of Amy Schumer and Steve Byrne's upcoming in-studio appearances, and a discussion about a Chris Rock movie being filmed at SiriusXM studios and the removal of a Paul McCartney autograph.

A subsequent segment further featured a highly insulting phone call with Lady Di, using derogatory terms like "bum," "pig," and "retard," as the hosts criticized her unemployment and lifestyle.  Lady Di’s increasingly bizarre explanations for her job history were met with more insults.  Comedian Steve Byrne joined in-studio, discussing a physical altercation with a cab driver that resulted in a broken jaw. Comedian Amy Schumer then joined the broadcast. A clip of a previous interview with Ozzy Osbourne was played, featuring Jimmy's mocked accent. The conversation continued with casual, informal discussions, often centering on Ozzy Osbourne and previous interactions with Lady Di.

The show then focused on personal anecdotes of physical altercations and embarrassing moments from Steve Byrne and Amy Schumer. Steve detailed childhood assault, subway encounters, an elevator altercation, and an incident at a comedy club. He also shared a humiliating story involving a Saturday Night Live audition video and his subsequent retaliation against Bobby Kelly. Amy shared a story about inappropriate touching by a production assistant and discussed the contents of her phone, including photos and videos.  The conversation included jokes about dick pics and an uncomfortable waxing experience. Amy also discussed her interns, their work ethic, and relationships, with one intern, Tyler, even calling in.

The broadcast's final segment began with a discussion about a male intern's discomfort around female interns and their involuntary erections. This transitioned to a comparison of the current female interns' positive work ethic with past male interns.  The hosts then promoted upcoming appearances for Steve Byrne and Amy Schumer, followed by a recollection of attending a Gene Wilder speaking engagement.  Due to console issues, an "After ONA Live" segment from a small phone-screening room, hosted by Sam Roberts, discussed the female interns' work ethic and included recording podcast intros, mentioning Scott Thorson and 8-track porn.  A phone call with a dentist was followed by more discussion of console issues, Dwayne Wade's fashion choices, and a story about Robert Kraft's Super Bowl ring allegedly stolen by Vladimir Putin. The segment ended with Roberts reflecting on the feeling of helplessness when things are stolen, bringing the entire show to a close.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive.  Yes, they're entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What planet are we living on?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio.  So shut the fuck up. 
[00:00:30]  And Anthony.  I live in a big house.  I make a lot of money and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R opening.  It sounds like a little.  What?  He did a dang open hand.  It only said a dang open hand.  Stop.  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I'm William Shatner, goddammit. 
[00:01:00]  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Oh, look at that.  Good morning.  Hi, everybody.  How's everybody doing?  Doing good.  Ah.  You made me laugh yesterday.  What happened?  With your text message.  Oh. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  Just getting a little update on your arm.  Your throwing arm.  My throwing arm is fucked.  My lower back is fucked.  Oh, my god.  People are suggesting all sorts of weird shit for my back.  Are they?  Well, I just read that tweet.  I gotta find it now.  That last guy that gave you that suggestion doesn't know what he's talking about.  I got two herniated discs and I blew out my back for the first time in like three or  four years.  I'm fucking in agony. 
[00:02:00]  Every day it gets slightly better, which is so frustrating.  Yeah.  You want to wake up and it's much better.  Of course.  It's kind of like when you have the flu and every day you're like slightly better.  When's the day where I wake up and go, oh, I think this is it?  Yeah.  The turning point, as they say.  Yes.  Well, this guy, Paramedic X, writes,  Opie, you ever try a teeter inversion table for your herniated discs?  Teeter inversion table?  What the fuck is a teeter inversion table?  Is that that old guy on TV that hangs himself upside down? 
[00:02:30]  Oh, I do that.  And I feel great.  I do that at the gym.  Yeah?  Yeah, but as soon as you stand up, all the fucking blood starts rushing out of your head  and you want to fucking fall over.  Do you get a head rush?  Yeah.  Oh, my god.  Do you get a head rush?  Sam, could you look up a teeter inversion table?  Sam.  Please.  T-E-E.  What's a teeter inversion?  Oh, my god.  What is that?  That's on TV.  I've seen that guy.  Oh, one of those.  It sells these.  Yeah, and I hang like that at the gym. 
[00:03:00]  You fucking strap your feet in there.  Teeter inversion.  Ours is upside down.  The one at our gym isn't that fancy, actually.  Do they have one there?  It's supposed to take the weight off your discs.  It does the same fucking thing.  You got to wrap your legs around it.  At this one, you don't have to.  You hang straight.  Yeah.  The one at the gym, you have to kind of like hold on with your knees.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, that's not it.  Then this one, what, you got hooks on your shoes or some shit?  Oh, yeah.  Because I'm going to bring in a teeter inversion table.  I want to do the ratio show upside down.  Do the show upside down. 
[00:03:30]  What does it do for you?  I guess it just stretches out everything, makes sure, I don't know.  Takes the pressure off the discs for a little while.  Yeah, puts everything back in place, probably.  Does it help for long term or for like more than five minutes?  Does it only help while you're upside down?  Maybe, yeah.  I don't know, man.  I mean, before I pulled out my fucking back, I didn't even think about my back.  Everything was good.  But that's not why I went to the doctor yesterday.  I went for my shoulder.  However, I gave Anthony an update, and the update was very, very simple.  I said, Anthony. 
[00:04:00]  Wow.  I said, pork chop sideburns.  Someone says he looks like bald Wolverine.  Yeah.  Oh, that's your dad.  My dad pictures.  Oh, yeah.  We're going back and forth with that a little bit.  I wrote, lucky me, tear in bicep and rotator cuff.  And then you write, holy fuck, what's that take to fix?  And then you wrote, when were you pitching for the majors?  I guess I missed that part of your life.  Yes. 
[00:04:30]  You'd only hear about those injuries from pitchers.  I think I might need Tommy John surgery to continue doing the radio show.  Exactly.  The Tommy John surgery.  And then, what did you write?  That was funny.  Damn.  Damn.  Any word on how the hell you do something like that to yourself?  I'd sure like to avoid it.  No shit.  No shit.  It's like, if the doctor tells you how you do that, please pass it on.  Yeah.  I think we'd like to know. 
[00:05:00]  That's good news.  He said no surgery, most likely.  Oh, that's good.  That's what I was worried about.  A little rehabilitation?  Yeah.  But if it's torn, I don't understand how rehab works.  I don't get that.  Yeah, right?  Wouldn't it just fix itself anyway?  Does it fix itself?  As long as you're not lifting cars or something, I guess.  But it's been aching for six months, I find, you know, I'm like every other fucking guy  out there.  Oh, maybe it'll go away on its own.  Fuck it.  Then finally had to finally make a doctor's appointment.  This has been hurting me for six fucking months. 
[00:05:30]  It'll go away.  Fuck it.  So.  Damn.  Yeah.  But then I'm hobbling at the shoulder doctor.  Yeah.  And everyone has to make their jokes.  Look, looks like you're at the wrong doctor's office.  What's wrong with your back?  Shut the fuck up.  I don't know why I feel like I'm living in a Twitter world wherever I go now.  No matter where.  No matter where.  Hey.  But it would be okay if you heard it once, but looks like the back doctor's down the fucking 
[00:06:00]  way.  I don't know why.  Everyone's got their Twitter comments.  I was reading some celebrity Twitter complaints.  Right.  Like people that have just gone on and said things like you.  Yeah.  You did make that one.  I know.  I was in that one.  Yeah. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  Jimmy was literally in that one.  Yeah.  What was your bitch?  Oh, it was when I was driving to meet with Vice or something and it was in Brooklyn.  Yeah.  And it took me that long to get down.  I think 2nd Avenue.  I was homicidal.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You were going crazy.  That's right.  It was that one.  The Simon Pegg one's good.  Go down.  Yo.  Just passed it.  I'm right near Rihanna and then passed that.  Oh.  Wow.  There it is.  Nice.  This is the one we talk about all the time too.  Simon Pegg.  Okay.  He goes, every now and again, someone sends me a supposed lookalike and it's always invariably 
[00:07:00]  some cunt who looks absolutely nothing like me.  Thank you.  Hey, I didn't know you were in.  And then insert fucking picture of someone that doesn't resemble you in a movie, news,  TV.  I kind of get that once a week.  Easily.  Easily.  Always.  Easily.  Dude, always.  Hey, I didn't know you were getting married again. 
[00:07:30]  Right.  Hey, Anthony, I didn't know you were the head of fucking OPEC.  Fucking assholes.  But I guess Simon Pegg goes with that too.  That's good.  Uh, Jim Norton, his was, uh, yeah, I just, it just took me 90 minutes to drive six fucking  miles into Brooklyn.  I am homicidal.  That's unbelievable.  90 minutes to go six fucking miles.  I had to go over the way.  I should have just taken the subway there.  Their criticism of my critique was right. 
[00:08:00]  I should have just taken the subway.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I went down.  You could have walked there.  You probably could have over the Williamsburg.  No, you could have walked there in that time.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was terrible, dude.  I wound up making the wrong turn because my GPS is a twat going to, uh, the Williamsburg.  And it put me on this, around the block where I had to go to get to the bottom of the  Williamsburg.  Oh, boy.  And it was fucking one lane of traffic.  I was out of my mind.  Sure.  Hating.  I at least hate going to Brooklyn.  Anything worse than when you make that move or that turn and realize, holy fuck, I just 
[00:08:30]  added two hours onto my commute.  And there's no fixing it.  You're trapped.  And there's absolutely no fixing it.  No shoulder, no turns, no nothing.  You go, you've got to be shitting me.  You are truly fucked.  Oh, the other thing really fast about the doctor's office, the paperwork.  Is there any way to get around that in this day and age?  Dode.  Dode.  Half the time at the doctor's office, I was just filling out shit.  Yeah. 
[00:09:00]  Just filling out my entire, they want to know my education.  I'm like, what's that have to do with a fucking hurt shoulder?  Uh-huh.  Here's what I suggest.  Contacts and all this shit you got.  I had a, I had a Google SiriusXM to find out what the address is.  The address.  Because I don't know.  And the business phone number for SiriusXM, I don't know this shit.  And you know what?  So I'm Googling, I'm not getting a signal, so I have to walk around and find a signal  so I can fucking Google.  In the old days, you couldn't Google or anything.  No.  You just had to know this shit. 
[00:09:30]  Here's what I suggest, though.  It would be so easy.  Everyone's got their phone.  You put all that shit in your phone somewhere.  Right.  In the fucking doctor's something app.  Right.  And then when you go to the doctor's office, you just send it to them, and they can print  it all out on their fucking forms, and you're done.  You know what?  In this day and age, you're right.  There's no reason to sit there with a pen and a clipboard.  You're right.  No reason for that anymore.  You just take your phone and go, here it is. 
[00:10:00]  Here it is.  Boop.  You know what?  You're onto a great app.  Scan it, and it's fucking done.  The medical community would eat that shit up.  Because they waste so much time, because then they take that form, and they put it  in front of the screen, and they're like, now they're typing shit in, and there's no  reason to be typing in shit and writing.  Right.  In the doctor's office, you're fucking, the flu pen that's been touched by every fucking  contagious asshole in there.  I think I used the pen more yesterday than in the entire last year. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  Who writes anymore?  And then you're writing the same shit on multiple forms.  And I feel like I have arthritis now, and I've always held my pen way too fucking tight.  Too tight.  I bend, look, I just have to fucking, look at this.  Oh.  Name in a drawer.  Oh, and name is still Anthony Cummings.  My fingers turn fucking red, because I hold my pen really tight.  How do you hold it when you write?  I don't know.  I've always held it wrong.  I do too.  And my stupid teachers always try to go, well, no, what you gotta do is you gotta take 
[00:11:00]  this finger and put it over here.  Were you one of the tards that needed the rubber band around the bottom so you didn't  put your hand too far down?  Oh, yeah.  There was that kid that held it right by the tip of the pen?  I don't even know how you're supposed to.  I guess you're supposed to just do it like this, right?  Oh.  I think so.  I think that's proper.  Two fingers.  I don't like that.  But I, I...  No, I gotta have the...  Oh, my God.  Jimmy holds it like he's gonna punch somebody.  Dude, I hold it weird.  Whoa!  I hold it like...  I thought I was bad.  That's how queers hold it.  Oh, okay. 
[00:11:30]  Good.  It's in my ass, by the way.  I'm holding it with my thumb, pointer, and middle finger.  Oh, wow.  Resting it against my next-to-last finger.  Oh, I see it.  It's almost a fist.  And pinky.  It's really weird.  Do you squeeze tight, though?  Yeah, I have really terrible penmanship.  Personmanship.  All I need is...  Pen person-ship.  All I need are three fingers.  That's how I hold mine.  Yeah, that's proper.  Well, this finger's here, this right on there, and then the thumb's got to be kind of wrapped  around.  It's between your thumb and pointer finger.  No, I know this is...  This is how it's supposed to be.  I know that. 
[00:12:00]  Control.  Control.  It's hard to write that way.  No, I can't get...  I hold mine like that.  It's the only one that does it proper.  Oh, I went through a lot of penmanship classes.  So then this guy, he's like a rock star.  He works on athletes and stuff.  I figured I'd go to the best, because I was really worried it might be surgery.  The best, Jerry.  The best.  And then they're like, okay.  I filled out, I don't know, like, I don't know, at least four forms.  And then they're like, okay, go get your x-ray, because he wants an x-ray before he examines  you.  So then I go to this other section.  It's within his office. 
[00:12:30]  And all of a sudden, they hand me another clipboard with another three pages.  Are you shitting me?  There was some lady, and I was trying to vine her, losing her fucking mind.  Over the papers?  Over the paperwork.  And she looked like she was all drugged out.  She looked like she was in way worse shape than me.  Yeah, a lot of pain.  And she had to deal with fucking paperwork.  Dude, in this day and age, there's no reason.  There should absolutely be something.  You just put it once on your phone.  You fill it out.  All the shit that any doctor would need to know.  Right.  Your fucking family history crap. 
[00:13:00]  Right.  Your name, your address, your fucking insurance carrier.  All these numbers that you need to know.  And then you just zip and scan it.  It's done.  And then if you zip and scan it, they might go, you know, we need just one little thing.  Right, right, right.  At least that's one little thing to add on to the form instead of all this shit.  I know.  I don't know anyone's phone number, so I have to look them up in my fucking phone.  Oh, the dumb phone number.  I remember when I was living in Huntington, I blew out my face some ridiculous allergy 
[00:13:30]  attack, which to this day, I don't know why.  Oh, is it all swollen up?  Ridiculous.  I couldn't see out of one of my eyes, and the other eye was closing fast, and it was  twice the size.  I have no idea to this day what I ate that made my face do this.  And I went to Huntington Hospital.  I'm in the emergency room, middle of the night.  My brother takes me, because I woke up with a horrendous headache.  I was in bad fucking shape.  And it was so obvious.  I needed to see someone immediately, and they sat me down with the paperwork.  I'm like, can we do the paperwork after you fucking inject me with something? 
[00:14:00]  It just doesn't make sense.  And it was a quick Benadryl in, you know.  That's all they needed to do, right?  They hooked me up to an IV.  I was extremely dehydrated, and they put some kind of Benadryl in for my headache and for  my swollen face.  Instantly, my brother is watching my face go back to normal like I'm...  Like the Hulk.  Like the Hulk.  He goes, this is unfucking believable.  Like your Bill Bixby again.  Right.  Everything just went...  But it's like, you couldn't do that before the fucking paperwork? 
[00:14:30]  Fill out your goddamn forms first.  I had one of those headaches where even the light hurt.  And they're like, no, you gotta fill out your shit first before the doctor will see you.  I'm like, you gotta be shitting me.  Whatever.  I do shit now with a, like, fucking...  The bane of my technical existence has been passwords.  Passwords, passwords, passwords.  You always think you're gonna remember it.  You always fucking think, this time, I'm gonna remember the combination of username and password. 
[00:15:00]  And then when you're fucking, if more than a day goes by and you're trying to fucking  pop it in, you're constantly fucking up.  Why is that?  It can only be these three!  Why is that?  I don't know.  Because you sit there like, oh no, I know this password's a little different, but I'm  gonna remember this.  I'll remember it.  That's right.  I put these numbers after it.  Oh, fuck.  It's all right.  So now, I just said, fuck it, and I'm just putting them on my phone, like in the notepad 
[00:15:30]  thing.  That's smart.  So if you find my phone, all my passwords to everything.  But I kind of code what they're for.  Right.  You know?  That's smart.  But it's enough where I know the passwords.  Because I was just getting to the point where I was freaking out.  Everything, though, should just be on your phone at this point.  But I also, I have a certain formula I use, like I hint to myself, password hint, and  it's like, I won't put the password on my phone, but I know the pattern I use, I'll  remember.  Well, a lot of times I'll use the initials of what the password is, like I'll know if 
[00:16:00]  the password is two separate words, I'll put the first letter of each word on there,  and then I'll be like, oh, okay, it's that one.  What about when you're picking a password, even though it's mumbo-jumbo, you're like,  oh, no, someone's going to know this.  That's right.  Oh, no, someone's going to figure this out.  I got to, okay.  I got to add some shit to this.  This is a weak password.  But then you add shit, and like, oh, no, someone can look out.  It's very obvious.  Like, oh, boy.  And then you're looking, oh, I'll never remember this one. 
[00:16:30]  This is way too complicated.  Oh, is that funny?  If anonymous wants to get in, they're going to get in.  If you're trying to fight that type.  But for the average person trying just to protect yourself, no one's going to guess  my password.  And in the end, it gives a fuck.  Yeah, there's really not much I'm going to find.  Who cares?  You want to look at my stupid sunset pictures and see my fucking dick pictures, whatever.  Lame emails.  I'm just the opposite.  If you want to look at my dick pictures and add a sunset shot, feel free.  Is it really that important in the end?  Yeah.  What we're tweeting and fucking Facebooking. 
[00:17:00]  I don't need people poking around in my Instagram.  Really?  Wow.  Going to see what you had for dinner for the past month.  Yeah, exactly.  Man, I like your paperwork idea.  It should be done.  I'm surprised someone in the medical community hasn't figured out that app.  Because it saves a shitload of time at the doctor's office, too.  Because a lot of times when your appointment's at 10, it's because they know you've got to  fill out all that paperwork.  And they know you're not going to see a doctor for at least 45 minutes.  And most of that is because of the fucking paperwork. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  Well, someone will fucking make billions on it, I'm sure.  I'm working on an app for that.  Oh, are you?  Yeah.  What's it called, Jimmy?  You got something going?  Pezclerd.  P-E-double-Z-K-L-H-U-R-D.  Pezclerd.  Yeah.  Why?  It's just a cool name.  It's easy to remember.  It's impossible to remember.  You're an asshole.  The paperwork is only going to get worse with Obamacare. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, yeah.  The Obamacare.  At least the IRS has got their nose in that Obamacare thing.  We know how good they are.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  That's good.  Can we go to Canada?  No.  I think we're going to go.  Sorry.  Let me say hi to Matt in Canada.  And I fully expect this info to be completely wrong.  But we'll try it anyway.  Go ahead, Matt.  Hey, guys.  So in Toronto, I'm in Toronto, but in Ontario, I have an OIP card.  I just walk into the doctor's office.  They got all my info. 
[00:18:30]  I just check off a few boxes if I have a heart condition and stuff.  The technology's already there.  From what I've understood and reading, it's actually the HMOs and insurance companies.  Almost.  People don't want to share their information and make it, you know, public to the other  companies.  So that's what really has hindered the ability to just have a card that you go into the doctor's  office, they scan it.  Swipe it.  Your info right there.  Imagine you could just swipe.  And then you sit there to watch TV.  You could fucking play Candy Crush.  You could tweet.  Instead of like...  It is just terrible that it's like you go to the doctor and you're just thinking, oh, 
[00:19:00]  the forms I got.  Right.  All right, here.  Take this.  There's dumb clipboards.  Right.  Like it's the 50s.  Unbelievable.  Well, in Canada, you got it all figured out, don't you?  You guys, you got your socialized medicine up there.  How's the mayor with the crack thing?  What's the latest on that?  I mean, I'm fully okay with a mayor that smokes crack up here.  I mean, who knows?  You know, the government doesn't do anything for us anyways, right? 
[00:19:30]  Mayor crack here.  But what's the latest?  We haven't heard about it in a while down here.  But I'm sure he's probably killed most reporters that have already talked to him about it.  He's still hanging in there, right?  I heard they found the house up in like Scarborough.  House.  Oh, you Canadians.  But the video is now just gone, so.  All right.  Yeah, he got to those people, right?  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And the Ocho Cinco thing.  We told you how this was going to play out.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:20:00]  We got another one right.  He was the one that, what, slapped his lawyer on the ass?  Gave his lawyer a little tap on the old ass.  Kind of, you know, hey, job well done.  And then a snooty fucking judge got all pissed and said, no, I'm taking everything back and  giving you 90 days in jail.  And we said on this very program, give it a couple days, maybe a week.  Everyone will relax and he'll be just fine.  And that's what's going on today.  Man, that's a big bitch on CNN, man.  I can't get enough of this.  They have a new morning show on CNN that they've been promoting the hell out of. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  And the Black Broad is a big bitch beast.  And me and Ant were talking about how they should do forced perspective and put her way in the  background of the set so she looks like average size.  She's just sitting back by the back wall of the set, like, yes, looking all normal size.  I've met Chris Cuomo.  That guy is a big dude, man.  He's at least 6'2".  And he works out a lot.  He's well over 200 pounds and in very good shape. 
[00:21:00]  And he looks tiny compared to this broad.  Look at this bitch.  She is huge.  She looks like the lady in Total Recall whose head came apart at the airport.  She's a big monster lady.  But CNN doesn't know what they're doing because they got Chris Cuomo and Kate Baldwin, I think  her name is, behind the desk.  And then the big bitch is to the left closer to the camera, making her even bigger.  Yeah.  Unless they're not putting her in, like, dark doll colors.  Right.  Every day.  It's been two days now and she's got neon dresses on. 
[00:21:30]  Yes.  Bright green today.  It's like two people and the sun.  Why is there an actual star on this panel?  She's fucking huge.  Yeah.  She's a big gal.  Holy fuck.  Roomie.  She probably has those giant, like, you know how, like, fat ladies will have big, like,  a big ham over there in their shoe?  You ever see a fat lady when they wear, like, little sexy shoes?  Yes.  Oh, God, I hate that.  Everything squishes out over the top.  Yeah, you don't want to just wear sneakers.  And then they got the double ass, too. 
[00:22:00]  The quato ass.  It looks like quato from Total Recall, if we may throw in more Total Recall references.  The double ass is a great description of this program.  Yeah, it's the triple ass.  Jimmy.  Yeah.  There's that, the big fat ass, right?  Right.  And then right where the asshole would be, if fat women are wearing, like, giant, yeah,  women jeans, you see there's another ass cheek thing happening.  The mini quato ass. 
[00:22:30]  Too funny.  What's the name of the big bitch on CNN?  Mikayla Parira.  Her Google images are pretty nice, but she is fucking huge.  There's a lot of from the head up.  She's not even, I mean, she's not even fat.  She just has, she's giant.  She just has a lot of big body parts.  Huge tits.  Yeah, big hitters.  How tall is she?  Do we have stats on her?  Maybe it was just deceptive because she's sitting so close to the camera.  I don't know, man.  She, I'm telling you, the picture where they have all three of them together, Chris Cuomo 
[00:23:00]  is, I'm telling you, he's a big guy.  She's got hair like my sister in the 80s, too.  Yeah.  She's a big fucking head of hair.  She's a big head.  Like, she's a big-headed woman.  She's got big everything.  She thick.  She probably charges at you when she gets mad.  Like, that's how you know she's angry around the office when she puts her head down.  You hear a galloping sound?  Yeah.  She's going to bury her forehead in your chest.  So everyone's asking us about the Atlanta guys.  Oh, yeah.  I guess when DJs get in trouble, they go to us. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  We didn't even have time to pull the fired, fired, so totally fired gag with these guys.  I feel bad for, uh...  Oh, there they are.  Oh, boy.  What?  They're on TV.  Hey, knock, knock, you're fired.  I know those guys.  I've done their show.  Lost his voice because of the disease.  He speaks through a computerized speech device.  Hello, Stank.  How's Nola?  Knock, knock.  Who's there?  Smother. 
[00:24:00]  Smother who?  Smother me.  Do me favor.  That is so horrible.  At least one of the hosts says he regrets the joke.  That is so horrible.  And a woman is...  Oh, go fuck yourself.  I love the outrage.  You see that fake fucking outrage?  Shut up.  That was textbook fake outrage.  That's like, okay, I know what face I'm going to use after this story.  Yeah, yeah.  That was horrible.  The joke is funny. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  The problem I got is very simple.  In this new world we live in, you've got to fucking know your boundaries.  That was the thing that got us in trouble.  The boundaries started changing.  We thought we could get away with murder still, and we were mistaken.  But it's gotten even worse, obviously, over the years.  It's so obsessive.  I heard the bit.  All right, yeah, it was a tasteless bit.  So if management goes, like, what the fuck are you guys doing?  Like, you're in the sports world.  No athlete's going to talk to you.  Yeah, you know what? 
[00:25:00]  Maybe that was a little fucked up.  Like, can't it ever just be where they come out and go, you know what?  We did a bit yesterday.  Not a lawyer's apology.  Not a, you know, we were outraged by this.  But how about, like, if they fuck up and just go, you know what?  Hey, man, sorry about that.  That was kind of stupid that we said that.  At 8.15 yesterday, we did a break that was deemed offensive.  Can't you just come out and be genuine?  Like, if you told these guys, hey, man, that was really fucked up, and, you know, we're in that world, and we don't...  I'm not saying people should never apologize if they feel they're wrong. 
[00:25:30]  Right.  But you have to fire the guys immediately.  You know why?  Once it gets a buzz like this, it's over.  Not necessarily?  Well...  It's just, it's too, it's too cruel.  They just would never...  I don't know.  But it's like, when you're being funny, I mean, you guys know how it is.  Sometimes you say stupid shit.  And, like, how many Stephen Hawking jokes have people done?  Oh, yeah.  Right.  How many jokes about other people who are injured, and it's just, you know, you just, you mock...  Or how many, like, when Dennis Leary, for years, did that voice about the guy with throat cancer. 
[00:26:00]  Right, right.  I mean, I know this is a terribly sad case, but immediately the fire guys, come on, man.  It's enough.  They want guy talk.  No, I completely agree with you, but you've got to throw in there that, you know, the world we live in now, man, you've got to be smarter, too, because you know management doesn't have your back.  And you also know that one fuck-up will cost you your job nowadays, unfortunately.  They throw them.  How many of them lost their jobs there?  All three of them, at least. 
[00:26:30]  Three?  Oh, yeah.  And they're actually really, they're supporters of the show.  They're nice dudes.  I've done that when I'm done, and I do them.  And they're not dicks.  They're not babies.  It's a fun show to do.  We support these guys when they get in trouble.  It's just, you know, fuck.  If the guy said fuck on the air, or cunt on the air, then I would go, you know what?  That's an FCC violation.  I get it.  Right.  Yeah, this has nothing to do with the FCC.  It's in, quote, bad taste for some people.  Was there a station statement?  Of course. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, please.  Yeah.  Give me this load of shit that the station put out.  It just sucks when guys are trying to be entertaining, trying to be funny in the morning, and then they cross the line.  That, you know, others deem is the line, by the way.  Oh, that's terrible.  Next thing you know, you've got to fire them.  That's ridiculous.  I mean, this woman right here that was, you know, oh, that's horrible.  That's horrible.  She will, just this morning, tell you horrible stories.  Oh, sure.  And not editorialize on one of them about how horrible it is, and what an awful person this 
[00:27:30]  murderer is, or something.  But, man, oh, that's a couple of jocks just having some fun fucking around.  Oh, oh, I have to say, that's horrible.  Right.  Is it?  We like, we love, we love it as a country where someone gets in trouble like this.  Oh, yeah.  We live for it.  We love seeing people get spanked.  That was just a quick clip on Fox and Friends.  We got the, we got the whole two minutes.  Ah.  We got the guys, Mayhem in the morning, I guess.  Mayhem in the a.m.  Why can we play exactly what they said? 
[00:28:00]  And the news does the same thing.  And we're not going to get in trouble.  The news doesn't get in trouble.  Thank you.  I've never understood that, because they just replayed the audio on Fox and Friends.  And now more people have heard the audio.  I didn't hear it until just then.  Why is it okay for the news to play it and then go, oh, that's horrible?  Right.  It's still affecting Gleason's family.  The mathematics of it, the one plus one equals two of it.  Sure.  You just fucking did the joke. 
[00:28:30]  Right.  You did the joke.  And you just pushed this horrible material to way more ears.  Right.  And eyes.  Right.  Now you could put, you know, intent and fucking all that stuff.  But the bottom line, you just played it.  I just heard it for the first time on Fox and Friends.  I've never understood that.  I mean, the famous nipple slip, right, to John Jackson.  I remember when Jimmy, oh.  Obviously, there's a huge audience watching the Super Bowl.  Yeah.  But then the media, the mainstream media, pushed it forward to the point where every single American  finally saw the nipple slip.  More people absolutely saw it after the fact than saw it when it happened. 
[00:29:00]  But when they showed it, it's okay because now it becomes news.  But it's still like, they still showed that clip to probably a lot of fucking children  indirectly.  We are in a wacky, wacky place.  I never understood that.  I'm glad you brought it up today.  This is the wacky place we live in.  Jesus.  Because they operate like under the guise of, well, they're doing a public good and public  service.  Which I got from any, that's why if you say fuck on the news, they show an image that's 
[00:29:30]  not supposed to show.  They kind of had that buffer where, hey, look, this is the news.  Yeah.  They're not going to be slapped with an FCC violation.  They have that.  We gave them that leeway as a society.  But now that they've become tabloid, and it's the same organization that shows these.  Your bit.  He's fucking playing tennis out there.  That's right.  Dick fellas.  They're digging up a body.  Dick fellas.  Right.  Good fellas.  They can do all the puns about.  Yeah.  Or ALS.  This guy with ALS, the paper would absolutely have some kind of an ALS pun or some kind of 
[00:30:00]  a thing on the, no one would ever cause them to task.  And they're doing damage because they're under the guise of giving real information.  Yeah.  You know these guys are trying to be funny.  Right.  You know a dumb comic is trying to be funny.  The news comes at you, you're like, well, these are the facts.  Well, the difference is Fox News played the audio and the guys in Atlanta played the audio,  right?  Mm-hmm.  If you laugh after it, horrible.  Play the same exact audio and give that serious, that is terrible face, then it's okay. 
[00:30:30]  But you're still hearing the horrible audio.  It's so dumb.  No sense.  Totally funny.  All right, here's the...  Let's hear the whole bit.  Yeah.  Dota bit!  I remember.  Who was Dota bit, by the way?  There was Maxwell.  That was Maxwell.  No.  Dota bit!  Is he still around that guy?  I don't know what happened to him, man.  I know if I ever met him, I'd love to talk to him about sleep apnea because he had a mass  and I'm obsessed with it.  By the way, I don't need the answer.  I don't really give a fuck. 
[00:31:00]  It was just a stupid thought in my head.  I don't need the answer.  Here's the guys from Atlanta.  So, Steve Gleason, an old player.  He's only like 36 and he's got Lou Gehrig's disease.  Holy fuck.  That sucks.  Horrible.  He can't speak through technology?  No, he actually...  With his eyes.  Yeah.  Eye.  Yeah.  Is he doing like a media tour?  I'm not really sure.  I know he did this.  Is that right?  Uh-oh.  Joining us right now...  Oh, no.  Steve Gleason on Sports Radio 790.  I've heard this one moment that this guy is going to replay in his head for the rest of 
[00:31:30]  his life.  Yes.  I'll tell you when...  Just like Sex for Sam.  Yeah, there's a one moment that this guy will play in his head forever.  I support these guys doing their thing, but man, wow, they're being brave here.  Just knowing the culture that we live in.  Holy fuck.  Holy fuck.  Well, there's been no outrage from ALS.  There's no group.  Like, they wouldn't have made fun of a gay player or a retarded player like this harshly  because there's been those outcries. 
[00:32:00]  So what happens is every time...  Comedians and comedy is now dictating the tone of the culture.  That's what a dumb country of motherfuckers we are.  If you make fun of something, then everybody jumps on that bandwagon, and now that becomes  the cause that you can't make fun of.  I'm sure there's a lot of outrage, but it would probably take a really, really long time  to get a protest together.  Exactly.  A really long time.  They might start protesting about this in about a month when they get everything together. 
[00:32:30]  The Zone.  Steve, congratulations on the Peter King piece.  Hello, Stank.  How's Nola?  Oh, boy.  Nola's great.  We had a great Father's Day yesterday.  I appreciate you asking.  Are you listening in New Orleans?  I am.  Chris, how was the Jersey Shore?  I just don't know if I want to play. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, yeah.  I think that's a real moment, too.  Oh, God.  He knew it.  I think that's a real moment.  He knew it.  He's like, ah, fuck.  This doesn't feel right.  In that moment, if that guy right there had stopped the bit, like, and just wrecked it  and goes, guys, screw this.  Let's just not do it.  They probably wouldn't have gotten...  They would have pulled out fast enough before they dive-bombed into the fucking ocean.  That was a real moment. 
[00:33:30]  That wasn't a guy going for a joke.  He's like, I don't know, man.  I don't know if I want to do it.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, poor bastard.  I just don't know if I want to play.  I want to play.  I wish I could play.  Yeah, you cannot play anymore, right?  No.  Knock, knock.  No, Steve, we do knock-knocks on Thursdays.  We don't do it on Mondays, and we just started doing that again on...  We do it on Thursdays. 
[00:34:00]  I may not be here on Thursday.  Knock, knock.  Who's there?  I.  I?  I who?  I blame Greg Williams.  He blames Greg Williams.  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.  Thanks, Steve.  Knock, knock.  What?  Who's there?  Smother.  Smother who?  Smother me.  Do me a favor.  Oh, boy. 
[00:34:30]  Knock, knock.  There's a third one, huh?  Who?  God.  God help me.  Who's there, Steve?  I'm.  I'm who?  I'm going to hell.  Yes, you are.  There you have it.  Three knock-knocks.  Those are some of the things we learned over the weekend.  Wow.  It was the smother, probably the smother lines, but that was the one that Disney will deem  unforgivable.  Oh, God. 
[00:35:00]  Are they owned by Disney?  I believe.  Aren't they ESPN?  Zone 7?  Yeah, ESPN's owned by, yeah.  Are they ESPN?  People were tweeting that they were Disney owned, and Disney is just brutal.  And that's where, that's when it all changed, when the corporate umbrella got a lot fucking  bigger.  The money, it pays a lot more money, and it makes you more famous because it can syndicate  you everywhere, but the downside is you're owned by a big corporation.  Right.  You're owned by, yeah, this, you could affect a lot.  Not just the radio division.  As annoying as things get around here sometimes, I tell you, man, it's... 
[00:35:30]  They leave us the fuck alone.  Break our balls about.  Yeah, it's kind of nice to talk about stuff.  They're incredibly incompetent, but they leave us alone.  They really do.  They do leave us alone in the end.  They'd never come in and say, hey, don't make fun of that guy.  You know, Bladder's talked a couple of times.  The fact that Bladder's a little bit squeamish about things is probably better for us, because  it takes a lot to get these guys to notice material content, even when it's good, you  know, like they don't push it out.  But Bladder will come once in a while, and when he makes that face, that fucking Jughead face, 
[00:36:00]  you're like, eh, maybe I should, uh...  But he makes you think, because they don't break your balls that much, so when he does  come down the hole with a material question, you're like, eh, if he's taking notice, all  right, maybe he's going to fucking point.  You know that face he makes, that squint, that kind of, like, do you need it?  That kind of...  But I actually listen to that, because I'm like, eh, he doesn't fuck with us too much.  That's a rough bit, I'm not going to lie to you, man.  Yeah, it's rough, but...  It's rough for regular radio.  Oh, yeah.  Unfortunately, yeah.  Regular radio, sports programming, eh, yeah. 
[00:36:30]  That's a, that's a closer world, when you're doing sports radio, too.  Personally, I don't care what anyone fucking says.  Right.  I agree.  Anyone.  I don't think anyone should lose their job for anything that's said on the air, honestly,  unless it's some legal fucking thing.  But just being tasteless or offensive, like, no.  What are you doing?  Because everyone does it.  Like, that's the thing, is, like, everyone says stuff that somebody could deem disgusting, 
[00:37:00]  and I want you fired, and if you're doing it in humor, it's, for some reason, a bigger  crime.  Right.  It's, that I don't get.  I don't either.  Like, a lot of people would think that being for the war, or for guns, or whatever it is  more offensive, or for abortion.  Sure.  Because you're actually for a cause that gets people killed, or kills fetuses.  Right, right.  How come you're not fired for expressing that opinion, because you're not trying to be funny?  Right.  But if you do abortion jokes, you're in trouble.  Right.  Yeah, you're not trying to be funny when you're talking about abortion in the news. 
[00:37:30]  A little commentary, a debate, things like that.  But, uh, make a joke about it.  In the wrong context, on the wrong platform, you're done.  What did the station say, Sam?  You got the official statement?  I love a good statement.  It's a sincere statement.  I love a good statement.  Okay.  We deeply regret the offensive programming.  They can't just say, by the way, they can never just say we regret.  Right.  There's always got to be some fucking adjective to make it that much worse.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The offensive programming that aired this morning on Mayhem in the AM on 790 The Zone, related 
[00:38:00]  to former New Orleans Saints player Steve Gleason and his battle with ALS, we suspended  the three individuals involved immediately following their comments and have since terminated their  employment.  Wow.  790 The Zone, our owners, sponsors, and partners in no way endorse or support this kind of  concept. 
[00:38:30]  Hang them out to dry part of the statement.  We sincerely apologize to Mr. Gleason, his family, and all those touched by ALS.  Now ALS will be the new one.  Don't make fun of that.  No more Stephen Hawking jokes.  No.  Because that's what dictates the culture in this country.  What someone makes fun of.  Like, what sparked the big debate on the word nigger?  It was Michael Richards.  Michael Richards' meltdown.  After that, the NAACP came out and retired the word.  Isn't that where the N-word came from? 
[00:39:00]  I'm like, when was the first time the media started saying the N-word?  I think it had been said before then.  Yeah.  But this big debate about, uh, uh, Lex and Terry got in trouble recently and had to apologize  for saying something about transgendered.  They had to come out.  Tracy Morgan with the gay talk.  Why is everybody talking about rape?  Because of jokes that Daniel Tosh made.  The whole country is being driven by humor.  Like, are we that fucking stupid? 
[00:39:30]  You're right.  It's all these jokes that are being told.  Like, do we, are we, how about this?  Where's the dialogue that should be driven about, say, privacy or whatever by the IRS  scandal or by things that your government's doing?  Not the fucking, not the humor of comics or radio guys, you dopes.  Right.  That's the ones they can pile onto because for some reason when you're doing comedy, you  can't, uh, you can't ask for First Amendment protection.  For some reason it's like, hey, but it's my First Amendment, right? 
[00:40:00]  Well, we're not interfering with your First Amendment, but, but our policy is that we  don't, oh, okay.  Meanwhile, you see a news program do something.  Oh, I found that so offensive.  Well, we're protected.  Well, the lines cross somewhere because, you know, we've been around long enough to remember  that as long as you, you know, were within the FCC guidelines, you were completely fine.  And the radio station had enough to fucking defend you.  And somewhere, and I don't know, I don't know when, because I think it was before we 
[00:40:30]  got fired for Sex for Sam.  Those lines crossed.  And I remember me and you always talking on, oh, the FCC, that's easy shit.  Yeah.  We know how to stay out of trouble as far as the FCC goes.  It's this other shit, the Asian jokes, the Asian accents, the, uh, uh, what else?  Like, gay jokes or anything about retarded people.  Retarded rape jokes.  Anything that is a victim.  Even back at AAF, we got sat down because of a dumb gay, uh, bit or joke we did. 
[00:41:00]  Yes, we did.  Got sat down for just trying to be funny.  Yeah.  And then also they started firing guys.  I remember you only got fired if you broke the FCC fucking, uh, regulations.  But if you're discussing, um, the gay lifestyle and religion and how, uh, you know, the Bible  and the, the, you could discuss that.  And if somebody wants to fire you, you could absolutely jump on, hey, what are you talking  about?  It's, it's a discussion.  It's a, you know, first amendment. 
[00:41:30]  Sure.  Although people are like that, Mrs. USA, who I, I found her opinion to be shitty.  She was asked what she ordered.  She asked about gay marriage and gave an answer that I didn't agree with.  But then we penalize people for the answer.  So we're teaching people, you have to lie.  Right.  And say it right.  Or you're going to be penalized.  We're fucking funny.  Even if you're asked.  Which is amazing.  It makes for a very boring media in general.  Because no one's going to speak their minds anymore.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  No one's going to speak their minds anymore.  Why would you?  Why would you when, when, you know, the consequence is, uh, your job?  Consequences, consequences, walk on the bridge.  They're firing someone almost weekly.  Yeah.  For just, uh, you know, giving their opinion or speaking their mind or going for a joke  to entertain their audience.  And no one comes out and defends each other.  Like these guys, people are like, well, you know, they stepped up.  Okay.  Okay, dummy.  Wait till it's your turn.  Right.  Yeah.  Nobody defend.  Well, that's why.  Everyone will have their chance in the barrel, you dummies. 
[00:42:30]  That's why, you know, I have no respect for the, for, um, well, I'll say it, the black  shows, because when I miss said what he did, they all applauded.  They're all like, oh, fuck.  Yeah.  Get rid of that racist.  We so happy.  You got fired.  And I remember thinking, Hey, maybe that's a little too sensitive in your world, but  eventually they're going to go after you and you're going to want an I miss or the  other radio shows protecting you back.  Yep.  Oh, they remember all of them applauding.  And since then, a few of those guys have been fired from being, you know, uh, going 
[00:43:00]  too far with the radio shows.  Yep.  But I remember they made that a black, white thing.  They're like, oh, fuck.  Yeah.  We got to get rid of I miss.  He, he's horrible for seeing a nappy headed hoe.  That's the, uh, that's the, the double-edged sword of the offensive and offensive to black  people.  Wow.  That's, that's the big one because, uh, but in the end you gotta, can't run away from  that.  In the end, you got to protect each other in this business.  Of course.  Because, you know, they're, they're ready to fire any one of us at any given moment. 
[00:43:30]  And when they came for me, there was no one left.  Exactly.  To defend me.  But, but there's some truth there.  First they came for the dick joke people and I said nothing.  Then they came for the retarded jokes and I said nothing.  And I joked about ALS.  And no one was there to defend me.  There's not a doubt in my mind that these people at SiriusXM don't have our backs in  the end.  We know that already. 
[00:44:00]  Yes.  We know if, you know, we get in trouble.  There's no one around here that's going to fucking, you know, try to save our asses.  We'll never see it coming because it'll be like something like this.  It'll be the ALS or it'll be the other thing.  Oh yeah.  Something that was okay this week will not be okay in six months.  Right.  Yeah.  So we just do our thing and, you know, until that day comes.  Yeah.  Until that day comes again.  Yeah.  Where we go too far and then these idiots down the hall will make believe they never  knew us.  There will be a statement. 
[00:44:30]  Management and the sponsors here at SiriusXM Satellite Radio.  Whatever.  Whatever.  It's too bad.  I wonder if that'll change eventually.  I don't know.  Where companies actually support people that are just trying to entertain.  I'll be honest.  I think from where we were when Bush was in office, I think it's gotten better.  It's gotten a little bit easier.  The pendulum has swung back the other way a little bit.  You don't have anybody doing anything on regular radio.  Well, that's true.  So how's it getting better? 
[00:45:00]  That's true.  Obama's, and then they don't target as much for stuff like offensive or sexual contact.  Well, everyone is scared shitless and no one's doing anything on regular radio, especially.  And in most cases, people aren't doing anything edgy here on satellite.  But that was pushed by the Bush.  That was pushed by the Bush.  The conservatives did kind of push that, and that's why with Janet Jackson.  But what do you mean by getting better?  You think it's going to lead to radio companies hiring edgy shows again?  You're not hearing about these people that are like, we need to boost the fines even more 
[00:45:30]  for the FDA.  And people are actually saying, you know, if a fuck slips through on certain shows, who gives  a shit?  But they're not saying any of that because their whole goal was to clean up regular radio.  That's the world we understand.  And it's cleaned up.  Well, I'm not even talking about usually material-wise, like just the basic FCC penalties for saying  fuck.  Right.  Now they don't even go.  It was to the point where if you said fuck, the FCC was definitely going to come after  you. 
[00:46:00]  People were filing complaints.  Now they just go, shut up, please.  Look at FX.  What are we going to do?  But they did their damage.  We were still on regular radio when they upped the fines.  Yeah, yeah.  What was it?  And what?  $350 to $350 to $350.  Right.  It went tenfold.  It went tenfold.  So they cleaned it up.  Per occurrence.  They know no one's willing to take a chance if you could be fined $350,000 for each incident,  by the way.  And for each market.  And for each market.  So if we said fuck in regular radio and we were on in 20 markets, which we were back 
[00:46:30]  in the day, that would be...  20 times $350,000.  That would be...  $7 million.  That would be $7 million, okay?  And then if the bit had the same occurrence maybe three times, now you're talking $21 million  in fines, stop it.  So in the end, you've got to blame the FCC.  It's the cost of doing business.  All right?  $21 million?  It used to be.  I know.  We remember.  When it was $35,000.  We had closed-door meetings where they would... 
[00:47:00]  Publicly, they would have to kind of scold us.  And then behind closed doors, they would go, look, it's the price of doing business.  You know, we'll write that check every fucking time because the amount of money we're making  from your radio show.  And they never paid the fine because they didn't want to set a precedent.  So what they would do is litigate the shit out of it for a long time.  Over and over again.  And then give the FCC a contribution.  Right.  They would be like, well, we're going to contribute some money to you guys.  We're not paying the fine.  This will disappear.  And everything disappears because of the contribution we're making. 
[00:47:30]  And that was the way they did it.  It was all bullshit.  No one ever paid a fine.  You couldn't pay a fine because then they come back and go, well, you paid a fine on  this penalty.  Here's the same circumstance.  So we're just going to have you pay the fine again.  Right.  Nope.  With that said, this happened last night.  Oh, you look like you were so comfortable with your rebound control.  Is that something you've been working on a lot this year?  I'm always working on that.  But, you know, it's tough because the ice gets so shitty towards the end of the period.  You know, you're going to pay attention to that. 
[00:48:00]  But it's working well so far.  Isn't it okay to say shitty on TV?  Of course it is.  We all say it.  Of course it is.  You're just giving these words some dumb power.  And who's really offended by hearing shitty?  I am.  All righty.  It was during the Stanley Cup last night, obviously.  Yeah, that guy didn't sound American.  Bruins won.  Two zip.  So taking two to one lead, right?  A lot of the world is less uptight about language and sexuality and whatnot also. 
[00:48:30]  And Clip's making the rounds, though, because he said shitty.  Who cares?  Shitty walk.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah.  How else do you describe the ice?  Shitty.  Because when you're playing hockey in almost July, you can't really keep those buildings  that cold.  And he wasn't talking about, like, there was literally shit smeared on the ice.  Right.  And it's shitty.  It's just another word to describe something.  Yeah.  The ice becomes a little harder to maintain.  A little shitty.  A little shitty.  I wouldn't even mind it that much that we're like this if we were just honest about it. 
[00:49:00]  Like, I find that what I hate about this country is, like, I think that we're very dishonest  about who we are, and that is what drives me crazy.  That's why I shit on the Founding Fathers are having slaves.  Not because they had slaves, but just the dishonesty about it when we look back.  And, like, if we just painted ourselves accurately, the good, the bad, and everything else, I would  have much more respect for us as a whole.  Like, we think, well, it's not a free speech violation because you're not being arrested.  But if you're going to somebody and the sponsor, even though they're doing well in the ratings, 
[00:49:30]  and you're going, I won't buy your product if you support that guy on the air because  he said what I don't like, you're going after his free speech even though you're not having  him arrested.  Yeah, it's just a technicality.  But no, why don't people just say that?  Hey, I'm for certain forms of censorship.  If I don't like what you said, I don't want you to be able to say it.  I would respect that honesty.  But again, no one's honest about themselves.  No, because they look at it like, well, I'm free to give my opinion to your sponsor,  and if they want to, you know, remove you, that's their prerogative. 
[00:50:00]  I'm just stating my case.  It's like, no, you know what?  You're using a mob tactic to threaten people with their jobs because you're offended by  something.  It's absolutely infringing on free speech.  Yeah.  The free market dictates that the ratings or people popular, that the advertisers go there  because a lot of people will hear it.  But in the end, what would happen?  Because I don't think there's enough people that would rally around what those guys said 
[00:50:30]  in Atlanta.  Anytime these things are played out and the company actually does stand by their personalities  and doesn't do anything, it goes away so quickly.  It really does.  And no one cares.  No one does care.  They're too busy trying to raise their families and fucking go to work and shit.  They don't have time to fucking protest a dopey show in Atlanta.  Correcto mundo.  Lil Wayne.  Lil Wayne.  Lil Wayne's brave.  Oh, he's walking all over.  Lil Wayne's brave.  What happened?  Singing in front of a huge American flag before it's let go onto the streets of New Orleans. 
[00:51:00]  He then continues rapping, stepping all over the stars and stripes.  Meantime, the lyrics to Lil Wayne's song, God Bless America with a K, are just as controversial.  My country, tis a big sweet land of kill them all and let them die.  God bless America.  Oh, this old God bless America.  Well, some say it's art, but as you can imagine, the rapper is facing a ton of backlash on social media. 
[00:51:30]  Some say it's art.  It is art.  Just minutes after footage leaked online, tens of thousands of people took to Twitter calling him unpatriotic.  Joey tweeting this.  It's Lil Wayne standing on an American flag for a music video?  Really?  That's disrespectful to the extreme.  While Pierre tweeted this.  There are other things to step on than old glory.  He should spend time with our warriors who have fought and died for our freedom.  I don't want for his right to do that, you don't.  Well, folks, desegregation of the American flag is protected by the First Amendment, so there is no chance the rapper would face any charges or the arrest of the person who was stepping on the American flag, but certainly upsetting a lot of folks. 
[00:52:00]  Did he step on it on purpose?  He doesn't like America.  He can't go somewhere else.  Oh, this guy.  Protected freedoms that are military people that have fought and died for that are represented in that flag that he's stepping on right now.  Lil Wayne has made quite a living on the American people.  He can go somewhere else if he doesn't like it.  Absolutely.  You see this?  He's doing this for attention, probably.  He's doing it because of... 
[00:52:30]  Why are you doing your job?  For whatever other reason...  You're doing it for attention.  Why are you covering that story?  One of the most popular rappers out there right now.  He doesn't need the attention.  He's doing it because he's a jerk.  Oh.  Whoa.  Hey.  All these people in the public eye now do stupid stuff and stuff just to get more attention to get on Twitter and get people talking.  We're losing our minds.  This country's losing its minds.  This country's losing its minds.  This country's losing its minds.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, later on...  It'll launch.  It'll sell a launch.  It'll launch up the NSA.  It's very popular. 
[00:53:00]  I got no problem with Lil Wayne doing that.  I personally wouldn't do it.  I'm not happy that he did it, but he's a clown.  Did he do it on purpose, or did the flag fall during the video shoot?  It's supposed to fall, I think.  The flag is obviously supposed to fall, but you can't tell from that shot if he's supposed to be walking on it for the purpose of the video.  Or if...  He had to know he was trotting upon it.  Yeah, of course he did.  Yeah, of course he did.  Yeah, he knew he was doing it.  You just don't know if he was doing it for artistic expression or because...  It's a statement about the people behind it.  Of course.  Probably showing the flag and saying something about, this is what's behind the flag, all these poor people in New Orleans who got treated like shit. 
[00:53:30]  Right.  And I'm stepping on the...  And you know what?  All the people who are these soldiers, that's the ones who fought and died.  They fought for your right to give unpopular expression.  Yeah, I hate when people fuck with the American flag, but it is legal.  Of course, and it should be, even though I don't particularly agree with the statement.  I'm obviously not a fan of that behavior, but you don't understand what the country's all about.  If you say that someone should get in trouble for that, to me, you're not patriotic. 
[00:54:00]  Right.  You think you're being a patriot.  These guys on Fox think they're being patriotic.  They're not.  I was also laughing because the lyrics are so ridiculous.  Oh, yeah.  It's horrible.  It's a horrible song.  So stupid.  It doesn't even rhyme.  No.  No, it's very stupid.  God bless America.  God bless America.  God bless America.  And then it's America with a K.  Of course.  You know, you gotta fucking flip that shit a little bit, right?  I'm surprised there weren't three Ks.  Huh?  And Debbie A did.  Uh-huh.  Is he popular, little Wayne?  Yeah, he's not as popular as he used to be. 
[00:54:30]  Where's he at with his zzzz?  Oh, he loves it.  He still loves the zzzz?  Yeah, that's the thing.  He raps about drinking codeine and fucking bitches.  And he's like, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's not like a politician who's, you know, trying to turn his back on America.  Gun charges.  I've never liked this blonde on Fox and then she gets her eyes all crossy and gets so  mad and she's like, he's obviously doing for attention.  Jimmy made a great point there.  What are you doing every morning? 
[00:55:00]  You're trying to get your attention.  And why are you playing it?  Right.  You're playing it for, and then this guy, you know.  You're playing it to help your fucking show.  That guy wants to be on blogs saying, so-and-so from Fox News says, Lil Wayne is a jerk.  Right.  Like, he wants the attention, too.  Yeah.  You're on TV.  You've got to come up with something a little better than he's a jerk.  He's a jerk.  And this guy's even worse.  At least Lil Wayne is doing it as he's expressing his art.  This guy's jumping on his bandwagon.  Right.  Yeah.  It is art.  Some say it's art. 
[00:55:30]  No, dummy.  It is.  It is art.  The next statement is the problem with this whole country.  Whether you like it or not, it is.  It's art.  Some say it's comedy.  It is comedy.  It is art.  Art Vandelay.  Yeah.  You know, when Giuliani went after, what was it?  Piss Christ.  No, no.  Brooklyn Museum.  The Piss Christ.  Yeah.  Brooke, he went after the Dung Virgin Mary.  You're right.  Yeah.  The elephant dung, right?  Yeah.  You're like, idiots.  Yeah.  That's art.  Sorry.  You might not like it, but you can't tell people what art is.  Yeah. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  If it's that disgusting, people won't buy the album, and then it would just be gone anyway.  And that's the market dictating what's right.  Just like, by the way, the same people that protected Piss Christ.  The same people.  Who did Piss Christ then?  It was some student.  I think it was an NEA National Endowment of the Arts thing.  I don't know.  Wasn't Giuliani around for that one, too?  Yeah, but that wasn't a New York thing, I don't believe.  I don't think that had anything to do with Giuliani.  Okay.  He was Brooklyn Museum of Art.  The elephant shit.  Somebody threw white paint on it and thought it was disrespectful to the Virgin Mary.  Right.  Some people didn't want any federal funding going to the endowment. 
[00:56:30]  Gotcha.  I thought it was a piece of shit art, the fucking Piss Christ.  But you know what?  The same people that protected that are a lot of the same ones who would say, don't do rape jokes.  There are a lot of the same ones that would say, don't make fun of gay people.  Like, everyone has their selective thing that they'll protect.  It's silly.  I liked Duty Buddha.  No, there wasn't a Duty Buddha.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Piss Christ, a Duty Buddha.  Why would I think that was real? 
[00:57:00]  Because I'm stupid.  And as clownish as Lil Wayne's lyrics were, I think somebody on the news calling him a jerk is probably just as clownish.  You think that would offend him?  If the newsman called him a jerk?  The newsman.  He don't give a fuck.  Lil Wayne don't give a fuck.  No, he's like, oh, great, this worked.  Well, let me tell you, he's a jerk.  A jerk.  That's no artist.  That's a jerk.  Who's that guy on Fox?  He's filling in for the other dude.  No, what's his name?  Do you know his name? 
[00:57:30]  I've seen him.  I don't know.  I had one of those prudes, a Fox News lawyer give me shit about my, you know, one of those fucking white knight jizz bags.  Gave me shit, but I went back and forth with that girl about Leah Dunham.  Right.  And, uh, oh, that was very disrespectful.  And then he starts calling me a hack, so we just start smashing each other on Twitter.  When was this?  Not too long ago.  Oh, that dumb lawyer guy.  The rock and roll fucking.  Oh, yeah, the rock and roll commentator. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, shut up.  How rock and roll of you.  Wow.  What a rock star you are.  Rock and roll, really?  I don't think that's true.  You're not the Sex Pistols, that's for sure.  No.  Just some dork and fucking, some fucking vulture lawyer.  You're more like 38 special.  Asshole.  Exactly.  I gotta say really fast.  I was laughing at myself all day yesterday over the Joe Piscopo.  I just love that shit.  Joe was great yesterday.  Oh, my God.  That was so much fun. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, Joe.  You'd think at some point he would just stop doing it.  And then I find out that he texted Roland.  Right.  And he goes, hey, did the guys leave me on the air when I was plugging my gigs?  And Roland goes, yeah, you were on the air the whole time.  And he goes, all right.  All right.  That's what I want.  Talk about the plugs, baby.  Talk about the plugs.  All right.  Hey, publicity is publicity.  Am I right?  Right.  No.  As long as they're saying your name. 
[00:59:00]  No.  He keeps tweeting us, basically trying to say that he gets it.  No, he doesn't.  Do you think he gets it?  Of course not.  No.  You're going out of your way to humiliate him.  And the moment he does get it, you stop doing whatever he gets and find a new way to humiliate him.  I just can't get enough of it.  He's old school.  He understands.  He gets it.  He knows the game.  What's old school about finding his special on YouTube? 
[00:59:30]  Watching it from start to finish and tearing it limb from limb.  We really did, didn't we?  Yes.  Jesus.  Yes.  And then just browbeating and bullying him into doing a Sinatra impression while his child is with him in the car.  When he knows you're not going to be there, and then you're not.  Yeah.  It was a good impression, though. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  Right?  He's the best.  Right.  I'm trying to find something really fast.  Hold on.  And then he's like sitting there going like, oh, this is therapy for me.  When you guys are just sitting there trying to get him to say something that he's going to regret.  And he loves talking about the impregnating those bitches.  Holy shit.  You just keep pushing and pushing.  Oh, man.  I wrote him.  I tweeted, happy birthday to Joe Pesipo. 
[01:00:30]  He writes me back.  Opie Radio on Twitter.  He writes, ha ha.  You got it, Opie.  I sincerely appreciate the psychotherapy.  You guys rock.  What?  And then he's responding to someone.  He goes, hey, love hearing from you, and will do my best to get back personally.  Thanks so much.  And thanks, Opie Radio, Anthony Cumia, and Jim Norton.  Except he doesn't even know how to work Twitter, because he wrote, hashtag, at Opie Radio.  Oh, yeah.  Hashtag, at Anthony.  You don't hashtag, at.  No. 
[01:01:00]  Also, Opie, you didn't write, happy birthday, Joe Pesipo.  You wrote, happy birthday, Joe Pesipo, and let's try to keep it dry today.  Well, we're trying to help him out.  Keep that dick dry for one day.  For one lousy day.  Don't be cumming in those women.  He's having kids.  He loves cumming in girls.  I'm obsessed with Joe Pesipo.  Well, you should be.  I'm trying to get inside his head.  Who wouldn't be?  It's a mystery.  Why would you continue to impregnate women? 
[01:01:30]  Why?  Because he's obviously a glutton for punishment.  Why would you continue to be a part of this radio show?  That's true.  But why would you want to keep starting over with a kid?  I like being a father, but I'm also happy as they're getting a little older.  Like, oh, okay.  But he keeps going back to the beginning with other women.  I don't know.  I think in some way he thinks it's going to keep the girl there with him.  You know?  He falls in love, he says.  He says he's a romantic. 
[01:02:00]  He just wants to put that horse cock deep.  Some would call that a sucker.  Yeah.  I mean, you'd think at some point he would realize, all right, I've been here before.  Right.  I know that I fall in love.  Let me give this a couple of years.  Right.  Because I know I also fall out of love.  But he never puts that into perspective.  No.  No, he needs just thrust to fucking push it right to the cervix and just spray. 
[01:02:30]  I'm in love.  I have to mark this woman's vagina as mine.  He's not happy unless he's coming and it's giving her an epidural as he shoots his load.  He likes to hit bottom with that fucking big giant Italian horse cock.  He loves it.  We've got to get him in studio.  He's all cock.  Get him in next week, I'm telling you.  Watering those lady seeds.  I really think we should do a Jersey Joe Piscopo dating game.  Yes.  He said he wanted to do it.  He wants.  Any women out there that want to be impregnated by him. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  How about girls?  Exactly.  We get some women.  We get some girls.  We get Bobo.  Right.  Yeah.  Any women that want to try to take something, the equivalent of an Italian pogo stick.  Oh, yeah.  That will not pull out.  Certainly not.  He probably doesn't even let you suck it because he wants the pre-cum in there, too.  Joe likes to say, no, no, no, honey.  We've got to get it all in the mix.  Got to get it all in the mix.  Everything.  He's an animal.  Not one drop outside.  No, no, no.  Why waste it? 
[01:03:30]  Oh, no.  If he has any pre-cum that gets on her leg, he swabs it off with his hands and he puts  it in her vagina.  Shoves it in there.  Don't waste any of this.  Jersey Joe Piscopo never needs a towel to wipe off.  No, never.  There's never a wet spot on the bed.  Every bit of fluid is being pumped inside.  Yeah.  And the girl stands up afterwards.  He goes, honey, what are you doing?  Oh, yeah.  He keeps her legs pinned back until it goes where he needs it to.  And he doesn't pull his dick out until his dick and her vagina are dry. 
[01:04:00]  So it flakes like one of the ice monsters from Game of Thrones.  That's how Joe's cock is when he pulls it out.  You've got to invent him to a compound party.  Oh, would be great.  Give him the big invite, please.  That would be nice.  He'd be a fun guest.  He would be fun.  He'd probably impregnate a woman right there in the hot tub.  Right there.  Right there.  In front of everyone.  You don't give a fuck.  Imagine that, growing up, if you knew that one day you would have Joe Piscopo impregnating 
[01:04:30]  women in your house.  Yes.  That would be pretty goddamn cool.  In a pair of white spandex in the pool, just showing everybody what gift he has to give.  I'm obsessed with Piscopo's cock and how he won't pull it out.  Good for him.  He won't.  I respect that.  He's a man of principle.  He won't do it.  You want to get in bed with me?  He loves jizzing.  You've got to have 18 years set aside.  Because I am impregnating.  Yeah, because I am fucking putting my load deep.  Just finds birth control packets in women's purses. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  Garbage.  Get that out of there.  Yeah, get rid of this.  What is this crap?  Morning after.  Fuck's it.  Fuck is that.  No seed left behind.  He won't allow any cum to be wasted.  Too many kids.  Yeah, a little bit.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  Amy Schumer's coming in today at about an hour, I guess.  A little over an hour.  8.45.  Very cool.  And Steve Byrne is here at 8 o'clock.  Who's Steve Byrne again?  I really don't know.  He's an Irish comedian.  He's on Sullivan and Sonny. 
[01:05:30]  Broke his fucking jaw recently.  They had to delay production.  How'd he do that?  Cabbie.  In altercation with a taxi cab driver.  Whoops.  You know this guy?  Oh, yeah.  I know him for years.  You just got to ask him about being on a show with the dad from the Wonder Years.  That's true.  Oh, very cool.  Yeah.  Yeah, cool.  No.  All right.  We'll get to say hi to Steve Byrne today.  Amy Schumer, 8.45.  And when we get back, a man losing his mind on another fucking flight.  Oh, my God. 
[01:06:00]  And we got audio, right?  Oh, yeah.  Hey, Joe Piscopo here.  You're listening to the opening.  Give me a go.  Let me give you a go.  Hi, this is Joe Piscopo.  You're listening to the opening.  Hold on.  Here we go.  What is this one?  Hold for a second.  Hold for a second.  Thanks.  Hey, this is Joe Piscopo.  I was there before they got arrested.  They got arrested, right?  Didn't they get arrested?  Indicted.  In jail.  They're out.  And I'm always there for these guys.  I love you guys.  Open and Anthony.  Like nothing else on the radio.  And you could cut this up.  And I'm sure they will.  I'm sure they will.  Wait, wait, wait. 
[01:06:30]  Hey, this is Joe Piscopo.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  I was here at the beginning.  I was the one.  I was the guy that was here for these boys.  God bless you, young children.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  On Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  And now, The Opie and Anthony Show.  Everybody's going to dance tonight. 
[01:07:00]  Everybody's going to feel all right.  Everybody's going to dance around tonight.  Everybody's going to dance around.  Everybody's going to hit the ground.  Everybody's going to dance around tonight.  Well, you can come on to my place if you want to. 
[01:07:30]  You can do anything you want to do.  Your song's on, Jimmy.  Everybody's going to dance tonight.  Everybody's going to feel all right.  Everybody's going to dance around tonight.  Happy birthday, Paul.  Happy birthday.  What?  I used to not like this, but you know what?  You kind of like it now?  Yeah, it grew on me a little bit.  It's not my favorite, but it did grow on me a little bit.  Are you everybody going to? 
[01:08:00]  Paul McCartney, 71.  Still doing it.  Jesus.  Big time doing it.  You see the wall out there?  Now there's rumors.  I think Kenny was telling me that they took the Paul McCartney autograph down.  They cut out the She-Rock that he signed here at SiriusXM because they're filming a movie.  Is that true, Kenny?  Is that what you're hearing?  What?  Yeah, Chris Rock's doing a movie here.  Is it about SiriusXM or no?  No, there was the whole SiriusXM logo on that pillar. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  So they took everything out and whitewashed it for the movie they heard.  Oh, okay.  What movie?  Some Chris Rock movie.  But why wouldn't they just, I don't know.  Is he playing a satellite radio host?  I don't know.  Maybe Sam could.  I don't think.  Sam.  I think in the movie, he does like a radio appearance.  Oh, okay, okay.  But they needed to get rid of the Paul McCartney autograph.  Well, because the logo is on there.  They don't want the SiriusXM logo in the movie.  Right.  So they wanted to paint over it.  Probably a fake logo or something. 
[01:09:00]  Right.  And if they, you can't paint over it.  But they needed to film at that very spot.  That's what I don't understand.  I know.  Movies are dumb when they do that.  Oh, we need that.  We've got a whole facility here.  Why wouldn't they leave the Paul McCartney autograph alone and go, why don't we film this scene  somewhere else?  You just got white paper and taped it to the whole thing.  Yeah, or, or.  No, no.  Put something up there.  Put a, I don't know, put a fucking picture or something.  No, we need to do instruction.  I'm in that movie, so I'll let you know what happens.  No, you're not.  You didn't know about it.  Yeah, I did.  I played a guy who saves the president while Chris is on the radio. 
[01:09:30]  He's talking and laughing, and I'm saving lives.  That doesn't make any sense.  That's stupid.  Chip had a very funny video yesterday that made me laugh out loud.  A Vine video?  Yes.  Which one?  He does illusions.  Oh, I think I'm right there.  I think I was looking at that, right?  Cocksucker.  Cocksucker.  For an illusion.  Keep your eye on the king.  Cocksucker.  It's time for an illusion. 
[01:10:00]  Keep your eye on the king.  Cocksucker.  Doesn't slide up hands.  The cards go flying.  I love it.  Cocksucker.  Keep your eye on the king.  Cocksucker.  It's time for an illusion.  Keep your eye on the king.  I love it.  Cocksucker.  It's time for an illusion.  Keep your eye on the king.  Cocksucker.  The trick doesn't make any sense. 
[01:10:30]  Why would Chip publish that?  He screwed the trick up.  Sometimes he just hits next and he doesn't mean to.  He thinks next means like next trick.  Oh.  See that.  We got a guy that wants to talk about the Vine videos of Chip.  Mike in Illinois.  Mike.  Oh.  Hi guy.  Hi Mike.  Hey Mike.  Is Chip up there?  Oh.  The movie one's really funny.  The movie deal.  Yeah.  I was making some deals.  Hold on.  Someone's been filming me.  Let's hear the movie deal.  Hey Steven Spielberger.  It's Chipper.  Sure I'll do your movie.  What the fuck? 
[01:11:00]  Hey Steven Spielberger.  You would respond to a deal offered by Steven Spielberger.  It's Chipper.  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What do you got Mikey?  Mike.  It's so casual.  What?  Hi buddy.  I like to say I love Chipper's Vine videos.  Do you know why I like them so much?  Why?  Because sometimes they're normal.  Sometimes they're hilarious.  Fuck yeah. 
[01:11:30]  Normal.  Hilarious.  Is this a toll free number I'm calling?  Toll free?  I'm on a pay phone.  The operator is telling me put in two more quarters.  What gear are you calling from?  I guess it ain't toll free.  Jesus.  I think he's lying.  He's like, you found a pay phone?  Yeah, I'm in the back.  That's where the homeless shit and pee.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What are you, the museum?  Right.  Fuck the bad guys surround me.  Oh yeah?  Oh no, he's in that Martin Sheen movie. 
[01:12:00]  Remember that guy with Lou Gossett where Lou Gossett plays the protector and Martin Sheen  goes out to fucking visit him in Queens and gets caught in that neighborhood and those  real bad guys surround him and try to make him take his dick out and jerk off?  I don't remember that one.  Get one off.  I think Kipper would.  Right.  All right, Mikey.  Thank you.  Perfect call for Chip.  Yeah, we're going to save you a couple quarters.  I'm a long time caller.  First time listening.  Fucking home run, Mike.  Put two quarters in.  Get yourself 50 cents.  This is Kipper. 
[01:12:30]  My nickname is Skipper.  That rhymes with Chipper, you piece of garbage.  Well, you think Skipper is Skipper?  Yeah.  Wow.  What the fuck?  This is one of the greatest callers of all time.  Ever.  It's right up there, certainly.  Right.  All right, Mike.  Bye, fella.  See ya.  I love you.  The Chipper and Marianne.  It's like fucking Gilligan's Island.  I got it.  Okay.  So we got a guy losing his mind on a flight.  You got the audio over there.  What was it? 
[01:13:00]  A Hong Kong flight back to New York?  Yeah, Newark.  Yeah, yeah.  There's something interesting, also, I wanted to add in when I heard about this story.  Yeah.  The fact that it originated, I guess, the flight in Hong Kong?  Mm-hmm.  I heard a story recently about something that happened.  In Hong Kong?  Yeah.  Apparently, King Kong went to Hong Kong to play ping pong with his ding dong. 
[01:13:30]  Wow.  Is that true?  Yes.  It's a fucking old kid's story.  Jesus.  Kid's story.  That is true.  What?  What is Flabio doing in the news?  Flabio, he's chilling.  What does he do?  He's picking up a man.  He's doing like a romance cover, like novel covers.  Oh.  Imagine how...  That's a big bitch. 
[01:14:00]  From Flabio to Flabio.  Holy fuck.  And she's got her hair big, too.  Put her in the back of the set.  Forced perspective.  It'll work out fine for everybody.  Something's got to be calmed down there.  New morning show on CNN, and they got a big bitch.  And she's closer to the camera.  I don't understand making her even huger.  Let's go to the flight audio.  So we got a flight coming back from Hong Kong, and we got a fucking passenger losing his mind.  Losing his shit.  This is enough to worry about in this world, and now you got to deal with these fucking assholes on planes. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  What was his problem?  I guess he thought he was being poisoned.  Okay.  Or he claims he poisoned everybody.  Okay.  He was bitching about the CIA and stuff like that.  He's just another...  He's an asshole.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's push play in this one.  Help me!  What is that?  What is he? 
[01:15:00]  What is he?  He's an Indian crazy.  There is man on the wing!  Man out there!  I need a order!  I need a order with your fucking gosh!  What the fuck man?  You think this is my best person?  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  See?  Muslim guys!  Muslim fucking guys! 
[01:15:30]  Yeah?  Fucking hell, mate!  Fucking!  If I die, I don't care, okay?  You think this is my best?  Fuck a man!  Fucking all the fucking white people there, sir!  Fucking white people?  Oh, boy.  Who do you think built that plane, motherfucker?  I don't care, okay?  My fist is balling up with the noise.  I can't stand this guy.  You can't try to do this one, yeah?  You are so bad.  He ought to do what George Clooney did to Quentin Tarantino in fucking Dusk Till Dawn in the trailer, in the fucking motorhome. 
[01:16:00]  Poof!  Right in the face.  Fuck the mess!  Hit pause.  Why are you annoyed?  Because no one...  This is why.  Everyone just calms it.  He's a nut, and he's on a plane.  You know how you handle that?  You punch his face until he fucking...  He's unconscious.  Yeah.  Enough handling these burdens politely.  Well, they are restraining him.  They are restraining him, yeah.  In his seat.  This is something me and I were talking about before the show.  How things have changed over the years, and people still have that 9-11 mentality, where it's like, alright, you're causing a problem. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  The passengers will get involved.  Years ago, that guy would have been spouting off in his seat, and everyone just would have been puffing on cigarettes, drinking a fucking Bloody Mary.  Martini and shaving.  Shaving on the plane.  Right.  And being like, patting those stewardess on the S-Con, look at that guy!  Hey, sweetie!  Look at this fucking guy!  Now, you pounce on him.  But, if this was, let's say, 2003, that guy would have had multiple fists in his face. 
[01:17:00]  He still should.  Of course.  Is he an asshole like that?  A fucking nut.  Another disruptive, fucking worthless non-contributor.  Enough with these people.  Well, we got Steve the therapist, who I guess has taken the place of the big tit monster therapist we used to have.  I forgot her name.  Lydia.  Oh, yeah.  Good old Lydia.  Lydia.  I wonder if she's still around with her big tits. 
[01:17:30]  Chlamydia.  Chlamydia, yeah.  Oh, and Steve the therapist is from your favorite state, by the way.  Connecticut.  It's Steve the therapist from the great state of Connecticut.  Good morning, boy.  Hi, Steve.  Hi, Steve.  What do you got on this guy?  This is clearly a guy who's either bipolar or schizophrenic, and he's off his meds.  Oh.  The whole paranoid theme of the CIA and being poisoned. 
[01:18:00]  Wow, you got to be a therapist to figure that out, huh?  Yeah.  But being off the meds is what bugs me.  I'm sick and tired of these fucking shitbags going off their meds.  Uh-huh.  Well.  It's a big problem, Jimmy.  I agree with you.  But how do you get these people to keep taking their meds?  They start feeling good.  They go, ah, I don't need the fucking meds.  I guess I'm cured.  Right.  Stop taking them and maybe yelling on a plane.  Yeah.  Cured?  What are you, a ham or something?  Go ahead.  Yeah.  It's a big problem. 
[01:18:30]  I don't know that there's really an answer.  Right.  I'm going to raise a fist in the jaw.  That would work.  Yeah.  Pipe him right down.  Yeah.  All right, boys.  I'm punching out.  Yeah.  You do that.  Thanks, Steve.  Punch out, cocksucker.  Who's this?  Who's this?  Who do you think it is?  Hi, Opie.  Whoa.  Wait.  Who is this?  It's Di.  Diana.  Lady Di.  I don't remember. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, you don't remember?  No, I'm serious.  Who are you?  You know who I am?  Explain.  I don't know who you are.  Oh, my God.  We talk to hundreds of people a day.  Who is this?  All right.  Well, we used to come over to the studio, Marion and I.  We used to come over there at, you know, WNEW and everything.  Doesn't really ring a bell.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi, Anthony.  Hello.  Do you guys know this?  Brog.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  We just wanted to find out if you guys are going to be available. 
[01:19:30]  You're going to be in the studio next Friday.  Not this Friday.  Next Friday.  For what?  We just want to find out if you're either going to be there or on vacation.  You know.  I'm the king.  I don't know.  Why do you want to know if we're going to be here next Friday?  Because we're going to stop by.  Who?  Oh, God.  Me and Marion.  Who's Marion?  Hi to everybody.  What?  She says hi to everybody. 
[01:20:00]  But who is this Marion?  Who are you?  It's Marion and me.  Oh, my God.  You know who we are.  The retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Oh.  Does that ring a bell?  A little bit.  All right.  That's like many, many years ago.  It sort of rings a bell.  Yeah, well, you still consider us the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  I haven't considered you anything in many, many years.  Ugh.  Ugh.  That voice. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, yeah, okay.  How are you doing with the drinking?  It's okay.  All right.  Are you doing it?  I drink occasionally.  Yes.  I drink occasionally.  When's the last time you drank, and don't lie?  Yesterday.  Okay, well, then, what was the occasion?  It was Monday.  The occasion when I was home.  So, what was the, last time you called, you said you didn't go out for a job.  What job hunting did you do?  Oh, right.  Oh, very good.  I did.  Yeah, no, I went out looking for a job and everything.  I went out looking for a couple of jobs. 
[01:21:00]  So, what'd you do?  I went over to Dunkin' Donuts, which is in my neighborhood.  Right.  I went over there.  Are we listening to a phone call from 12 years ago?  Yeah.  Huh?  What?  How is it that someone's life doesn't change at all?  Not an iota.  Nope.  What do you mean?  This phone call could be 12 years old.  You're still a little old.  I mean, I've been out looking for a job.  You're still a drunk making believe you're not a drunk that's making believe that she's 
[01:21:30]  actually going to find work.  This is a 12-year phone call.  Yeah, but no, no, no.  Yeah, but no, no, no.  I've actually been out looking for work.  Oh, so how is that going?  Iraq, find a phone call from 12 years ago, please.  This is the exact same fucking shit.  I have to wait for these places to call me back.  No, but how many places did you look for?  Last time we talked to you, we established that you service Bill Orly for your rent.  Right.  We did not establish it.  Yes, we did. 
[01:22:00]  We did.  Yes.  Wait, wait.  I'm behind on this one because I wasn't here that day.  She sucks the guy's cock that she's staying at the place.  Oh, don't do that.  Yes, you did.  You admitted it.  You admitted it.  He treats your mouth like a pocket vagina.  Right.  Oh, Jesus.  No.  No disrespect.  No.  You're a fleshlight with a dim bulb.  Thank you.  A flesh heavy.  And by the way, by the way.  Oh, what?  I'm going to go see the monkeys.  No one asked you. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  I'm going to go see them July 17th.  Yeah.  Red Bank.  Remember the Cal Basie Theater, Jim?  I do, yes.  How does we remember them?  That's where they're going to be at.  We learned last time she called in and instead of looking for jobs, she sits at home and watches  the monkeys.  She watches the monkeys and the Pardes family.  No.  Who gives a fuck that you're going to see the monkeys?  Who gives a fudge?  Why not?  Oh, why would that be interesting to anyone? 
[01:23:00]  It's not.  Tell Opie the Ron Jeremy story that you called in to tell.  Oh, God.  Oh, yeah.  Well, I met Ron Jeremy and he gave me a t-shirt.  Holy fuck.  And I looked him up and down.  I looked him up and down and I said, well, hey, you know, I was just imagining what he  would look like naked, you know.  Yeah, it's hard to find images of that.  Yeah.  Just look in a mirror.  You know, that bothered him.  I mean, I don't know.  What I'm trying to say is I, you know, I was trying to imagine him like he looked years 
[01:23:30]  ago.  We understand.  I remember him years ago.  What the fuck?  Who gives a fuck about any of this?  You remember how she just would have this inane conversation?  I heard when she finally came back, I think on Sam's show.  And then the next day I was out and you guys talked to her.  It's like, but this is the exact same shit from 12 years ago.  It bothered her, Ron Jeremy, that she looked at him like that.  He didn't like it.  He remembered the incident.  He felt it was really kind of dehumanizing and he's beyond that point.  And you were supposed to apologize and you never did. 
[01:24:00]  I don't know what he felt like when I was looking at him.  Well, I'm telling you because I know him.  A lot of people look at him.  Not like that.  Not like the way you, because he mentioned that to me.  No, no, no.  Not like that.  Okay.  But anyway, I got a free t-shirt.  No, tell him what you said, though.  Because that was the big thing, like the interaction that you had.  The interaction I had?  With you, it's an O shirt.  No, no, no.  She's fat.  They're the brand new shirt.  Oh, oh, the brand new shirt.  Wait a minute, hold on.  So you're looking for a job? 
[01:24:30]  I'm looking for a job?  She's the female chip.  No, no, no.  Has that been said yet?  Yeah.  What about men?  They don't know anything about me looking for a job.  But they both are.  You went to Dunkin' Donuts, right?  Yeah, what'd you do?  And what happened?  What happened there?  I don't know.  What do you mean you don't know?  What did you do?  You just walked in and stared?  You filled out an application.  What did you do besides clear the fucking racks?  I just filled out the application, and I'm waiting for them to call me back. 
[01:25:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  Can I start from the beginning?  I haven't...  Oh, forget it.  And by the way, the liquor store, too.  Of course.  Oh, good.  Donuts liquor.  Why would they hire you?  Donuts liquor.  That's brilliant.  Lady Di.  What?  That's the whole statement.  It's a job.  Yeah.  I believe I haven't seen or talked to you in eight years.  It's Chris.  In eight years.  Is that Chris Rock?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Chris.  I only came in because of Norm.  Yeah.  We know that. 
[01:25:30]  We know that.  What's up, man?  How you been, man?  What's going on, brother?  How are you?  Good to see you.  Good to see you.  Good to see you.  Good to see you.  Good to see you.  Good to see you.  You guys on the air?  Yeah, we just pop on here.  You don't have a story or anything?  Lady Di, we'll get back to you.  We got Chris Rock in studio.  What's up, man?  Our pal.  What's going on?  Is there some movie being shot here?  Just the one with Dice.  Is that one?  Yeah.  Hey, hey.  You know what's weird?  When Dice was Dice, and he's still Dice, but because all the guys used to dress just 
[01:26:00]  like Dice, too.  Yeah, yeah.  He'd be like Dice and the Diceettes.  All you guys had on leather jackets, like, you know.  He made everybody buy, he took us out on a shopping spree one day, and he made us buy  Dice stuff.  He's like, nah, you gotta get that t-shirt in like a size XXL.  And you're just like, Dice, what the fuck?  I want something like more form-fitting.  Ah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  He made us buy.  You'd have to buy stuff like him.  It was black hoodies that were way too big.  Yeah, way too big.  And I'm like, look, if you give me a medium or a large, I'll wear this. 
[01:26:30]  And he refused.  Now, that's how everyone wished.  Right, right.  And you gotta dress like him, because Dice was in L.A., and Eddie Murphy, and Stallone  made everybody dress like Dice.  Exactly.  So all of those guys look like Edettes and Stalloneettes, and, you know.  I'm shooting a movie here next week, so I gotta, like, do like a look.  So all these people are with you?  Yeah.  Wow.  That is a hell of an entourage, man. 
[01:27:00]  It fills the hall.  It's a movie, and they're like, they actually have real jobs.  That's true, yeah.  No one's job is to, like, you know, clean my rims or anything.  Where's the snarky-looking girl with the headset on that tells everybody what to do?  I don't hire any people anymore.  Oh, no.  You know this?  Yeah, exactly.  You're just potential losses.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on, we gotta tell you one thing before you leave.  There's controversy around your movie.  They removed a Paul McCartney autograph for you.  What?  What are you talking about?  In the lobby, there's, like, a pillar, and Paul McCartney signed that. 
[01:27:30]  And Keith Richards.  And also Keith Richards, and they removed it, and they said it's because of the movie you're  filming.  Really?  They didn't talk to us.  No, they just cut it out.  They cut out the section.  They cut out the sheetrock.  And they were gonna do that anyway, and this was the excuse to do it.  They cut out the section, and they preserved the autograph on a piece of...  Sheetrock.  On Sheetrock, and they probably made the movie pay for it, and that's what they were waiting  for.  I gotta go deal with these guys.  Good seeing you, Chris.  You at the gym?  You at the gym?  You still doing it? 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, look at him.  Oh, is that the gym?  It's to eat and butter.  Great.  Chris Rock, everyone.  Later, Chris.  Stopping in to say hi.  Look at all the people he comes around with.  There's like 20 people.  Yeah.  This is hilarious.  There's people with folders and papers, and right now they're looking at lights.  Like, look, he's looking up at the incandescent, the fluorescent lights.  I want to be in the movie.  I should have asked.  They're just wandering around.  Yeah.  Taking a look.  You blew it, dude.  Hey, I could be in the movie.  That's so...  There's just so many people out there.  That's so cool.  It's amazing.  Filming a movie here. 
[01:28:30]  Chris Rock movie.  Wow.  Hey, hey.  Wow.  Is this not a radio movie?  Maybe I'll be discovered.  From what I've heard, it's all rumors and hearsay, but I believe that Chris Rock's character  does radio appearances.  Okay.  What's that?  My favorite part of that whole thing was Lady Dysang.  Who's Chris?  Who's Chris?  She's like, who's Chris?  I did it on purpose.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  No, no.  I know who Chris is now.  Oh, good.  Good for you.  And also, good for you.  CNN has a story.  As we talked to you, it says moderate drinking is okay. 
[01:29:00]  Oh.  Yeah.  There you go, Lady Di.  Yeah.  Could you explain one thing?  I haven't talked to you in eight years.  These guys have talked to you recently.  What has changed in your life in eight years?  Good question.  Last we checked in, you were blowing hobos, I believe.  No.  That never happened.  I guess it did.  So what has changed in eight years?  Um, well, we have a place to stay.  Me and my roommate.  He's your boyfriend. 
[01:29:30]  He's your fucking, yeah.  You blow him, you blow him so you don't have to pay rent.  Exactly.  Come on, let's.  No, no, no, no.  I help out with the bills around here the best I could.  But you, how?  You don't have a job.  His name is Bill.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  But don't let her off the hook.  How do you help out with the bills?  Well, whenever I can.  But you, like Anne said, you don't have a job, so where's, where's this money coming  from to pay the bills?  Opie, my dad left me money, okay?  Son of a bitch.  Yeah, she's been living off her dead dad.  Her dead dad's money. 
[01:30:00]  No, no, no, no.  That's, no, no, no.  Both my parents left me money.  How much?  Oh, that's none of anybody's business.  How much?  How much?  Ballpark.  It wasn't millions, if that's what you're asking.  No, we don't think it's millions.  Was it more than $30?  Yes, more than $30.  More than $30.  All right, all right.  Was it $10,000?  Something like that.  Somewhere around there, $13,000.  Okay.  $13,000.  So you went through that already.  No, no, no, no.  Well, she doesn't pay rent.  She blows the guy for rent. 
[01:30:30]  She sucks his cock for rent.  So we know she sucks dick to get her rent paid.  Okay.  Imagine how proud her dead dad would be.  Oh, God, right?  He left me $18,000 and then another $13,000, $14,000 on top of that.  What?  So how much do you leave you?  $30,000?  Just say that.  Something like that, yeah.  Don't just keep giving us...  Something like that.  Don't give us figures that make us do the math.  Just tell us.  All right, hold on a minute.  Lady Di, hold on a minute.  Hold on a minute.  I begged DRock to find a clip of Lady Di. 
[01:31:00]  He found one from 2004?  The beginning of November 2004.  We were on the air for a month.  It's a quick clip, right?  This clip is almost nine years old.  Nine years old.  All right.  This is going to make my point.  Go ahead.  Still out there looking for a job?  Yeah, sure you are.  Yeah.  Pounding the pavement?  Well, not now.  Pounding the pavement?  Well, at least you sound kind of sober today.  She does that whenever she walks.  What job are you looking for?  A tequila worm eater?  No.  No. 
[01:31:30]  No, no, no.  Jobs in town.  I'm trying to look like all over the place.  Clothing stores.  All that other stuff.  That must be where you are now, right?  Looking for work?  Yeah.  So where are you?  Same conversation.  Well, I'm at home right now.  Oh, you're at home right now.  That's where all the jobs are.  Okay, that's from nine years ago.  Wow.  That's 2004.  Yeah, and we're having the same conversation nine years later.  Lady Di, did you hear that?  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  I'm sorry.  Let's put her back on.  Yes.  Lady Di, did you hear that?  Musetta.  Yeah. 
[01:32:00]  Now, that was you nine years ago.  Same conversation.  Nine years ago?  Oh, and then she repeats.  Remember this, Opie?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Wasn't I kind of like homeless nine years ago?  You're homeless now.  You're a bum now.  If you aren't sucking cock.  Because you're sucking dick.  She's questioning the old version of herself.  Right, right.  That was you.  Wait a minute.  Were you homeless or not?  I don't know.  That was you from nine years ago saying that you were at home looking for a job.  I got you.  I got you on this one.  All right, that was nine years ago. 
[01:32:30]  Now I remember.  Okay, tell us something, Lane.  But don't you find it a little disheartening, Lady Di, that you're having the same exact conversation  with us nine years later and nothing has improved in your life?  You're expecting different results?  Nothing has been improving because there's really no work out there, whether you believe  it or not.  There's really not that much work.  Nine years!  And you're not looking for a position at IBM.  She's been looking for work.  There's no jobs at radio, but I think there's still jobs at D&D. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, she's been looking for work so long that when she started, the economy was good.  Right, the economy was good when you started.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, I guess not for me.  What?  A little chuckle.  That was a great chuckle.  Lady Di.  What are you doing?  Not just the name.  I remember it.  Why don't you fucking work? 
[01:33:30]  I don't know.  Yes, you do.  Yes, you do.  I really don't know.  I go there.  No, you don't.  You're not looking for a job.  You're lying.  You're a liar.  You're a compulsive liar.  Yeah.  You're not being honest with anybody.  You're lying to yourself.  What do you say to you?  Get sober.  That's why.  Get sober.  And get a job.  You lost your son.  You didn't take care of him.  What's that?  I didn't lose him.  Yeah, you did.  You didn't raise him.  During the time where he needed a mother and needed a mother. 
[01:34:00]  That was going to support him.  You fucking did nothing for him.  And he had to leave your house.  Because you didn't have one at that point.  And live with other people.  Who said I was living with other people?  What did you just eat?  Oh my God.  What were you paying first and last?  What did you just eat?  Dick in the mouth.  We were just waiting enough to take me back then.  That's fucking July's rent right there in our fucking mouth.  Just unloaded July.  All right, look.  I will pay the rent. 
[01:34:30]  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I can't take her anymore.  All right.  Answer this simple question.  Good luck with this.  Sure.  What did you just eat?  What did I just eat?  I had a steak last night at London Broil.  What did you just put in your mouth?  Oh, a cigarette.  You just ate a cigarette?  What are you, a fucking goat?  I just, well, you know, it's kind of like hard to put a cigarette in your mouth when you 
[01:35:00]  have a cell phone in one hand and one free hand.  Yeah, I know.  Because I need at least two hands to juggle when I put it.  No, it's not.  It's easy to do.  Right.  That's easy to do if you're that fucking, if you're Steve Gleason could do that.  Oh, now see?  I have to get one of those handsets for this phone.  Or a different phone anyway.  How about you get a job?  Yeah, how are you affording cigarettes?  You just get a job, Di.  How are you affording cigarettes? 
[01:35:30]  Good question.  You have to give up the ass?  How do I afford cigarettes?  Do you give up the ass for the cigarettes?  I think cigarettes are just hand jobs.  No, Opie, no.  Oh, then it must be your dead dad's money.  I thought it was a real fucking question.  I'm sorry.  Well, you know what?  You know what?  That's a pretty sensitive subject right now.  What is, sweetheart?  What is?  What's sensitive?  Oh, my dad.  That's a pretty sensitive.  Why?  He's dead.  He passed away.  What's sensitive about it?  I don't know he passed away.  Yes, he did.  How was Father's Day when you're spending his hard-earned money on beer and fucking cigarettes? 
[01:36:00]  No, I spent...  How was...  Happy Father's Day there?  What'd you do?  What'd you do?  I spent his hard-earned money on putting flowers on his grave.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  What'd you go with?  Fucking plastic...  I went with my roommate.  Oh, did you suck...  Did you suck his cock on your dad's grave?  No, I didn't.  I wouldn't.  Oh, come on.  I wouldn't do stuff like that.  Obviously not.  Hey, Chris.  I love Blink.  It's my favorite part.  I don't do stuff like that. 
[01:36:30]  And I don't think anybody else did either.  I didn't see anything else turn around in the cemetery, so I don't do stuff like that.  All right.  Yeah.  Lady Di.  I won't be bad.  I won't get a job.  No, you won't.  You said this.  It's nine years.  Nine years.  Nine years.  Nine years you said this.  For nine fucking years.  You're not getting a job.  Fucking years.  Well, what do you want me to do?  Get a job!  Why don't you get a fucking job?  And they don't call you back.  No, because you're a babbling idiot. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  First of all, you probably don't present yourself well.  Right.  You probably go in there with your big bloated W.C. Fields face when you're fucking...  You're drunkard.  And then you babble like an idiot, where they throw the application away before the fucking  bell rings when you're leaving the door.  And then you fucking...  Yes!  And then you don't, like...  They follow up.  You're the one that's supposed to call them.  I know that.  But...  I don't have their phone numbers. 
[01:37:30]  That was just so mean.  Of course it was.  It's true.  It's so...  Ah, yes!  I'd like to apply for a position in your organization!  Ah, yes!  Perhaps I could put jelly in the donuts!  Ah, yes!  You fucking pig!  Hey, listen...  She could be the most frustrating person I've ever fucking come across. 
[01:38:00]  No, I'm not the most frustrating person.  I think you're...  I think you are.  I think you are.  I need a position to make some currency to purchase more alcoholic beverages!  Yeah!  Oh, boy, oh, boy.  Big bloated W.C. Fields.  She is.  Ha, ha, ha, ha!  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  We're just having fun.  Look at that.  Yeah, I know you are.  What are they doing?  I don't know.  They're studying our studio.  Maybe we could be part of this film.  You...  Maybe they're just going to use your studio. 
[01:38:30]  Fuck, of course.  You are a disaster, Lady Di.  Thank you.  Well, nine fucking years.  Yeah, I found the tape, man.  I knew it was the same conversation, and Iraq fucking backed me up with a clip.  And your voice is exactly the same.  Yeah, it was the same conversation.  I know I was still looking for a job back then.  You've never looked for a job.  I don't think you've ever looked for a job.  In nine years, you can accidentally get a job.  Right.  Where you wake up and go, holy shit, I'm employed.  Exactly.  We're even trying. 
[01:39:00]  Exactly.  Okay.  Nine years ago.  Yes, nine years ago.  Yeah, you could luck up on a job.  Right.  Maybe stand in for a pig in a pig roast or something.  Okay, yeah.  That was just mean.  I'm sorry.  And you're coming in next.  Oh, my God.  Go ahead, Di.  What do you say?  No, no, no.  You're about right.  That's around the time that I was looking for a job.  We know we're right.  We have the date on the fucking tape.  We know.  You idiots. 
[01:39:30]  You're right.  You're right.  Yeah, we know.  We're like, we need her to tell us we're right.  She gave that one to you guys.  Yeah, yeah.  Holy fuck.  Lady Di.  All right.  The reason that I called is are you guys going to be around on the 28th.  Oh, God.  I said, why are you coming in here next Friday?  Because we would like to see you guys again.  Is there something wrong with that?  For what reason?  I don't know.  We're big radio stars now.  We don't need your shit anymore.  All right.  Okay. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, come on now.  How are we used that fun?  She's taking me seriously.  How are you?  What?  Then you'll be radio stars, really.  What?  Get on a regular radio station.  Oh.  Oh.  Shit.  That fucking hurts.  Exactly.  No, I'm not.  Never mind.  Why don't you get a regular job?  Wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on, Lady Di, if you can, for a second. 
[01:40:30]  Why is that guy just staring at us?  There's a guy.  There's 20 people outside our studio with Chris Rock.  They're just like studying our studio and the facility in general.  Go ahead, Di.  He just talks.  Hold on.  I know.  Hold on.  She just talks.  I was collecting unemployment for a long time.  Right.  Oh, great.  That doesn't mean you're working.  You're a burden.  That meant I put into it.  You didn't put all that in.  Believe me, you didn't put as much into unemployment as you take out nine fucking years. 
[01:41:00]  Are you a fan of Obama?  Sure.  I love the president.  Why?  Of course you do.  Because you're a fucking, because you're a bum that doesn't do anything.  You are a bum.  You should have dirty cheeks and be riding a train around the country.  She'd be in a boxcar.  Was it easier to be a bum under the Bush administration?  True.  That's a great question.  That's a great Obama administration.  She knows.  She knows.  She's a two-president fucking slouch. 
[01:41:30]  A two-president bum.  Yeah.  You are a bum.  You've been a bum.  Iraq was our ally.  Now, are you guys going to be around next Friday?  Ask that again.  You haven't said that enough times.  You fucking, oh my God.  And I'll say again, why?  What are you going to do for the show?  We don't just have people come in and say hi.  Yeah.  Except Chris Rock.  We can miss out.  Good point, Jimmy.  Good point.  What?  We'll decupt it for the show.  What?  How about we drop you in Lakehurst, New Jersey, and you recreate the Hindenburg? 
[01:42:00]  You big pig.  Because she's fat.  You guys are going to be around.  Oh, she's a blimp.  Where's Marion?  You're going to be around.  Don't worry about it.  We'll figure out something.  Where's Marion?  Yeah, where's Marion?  Working?  She's working.  Of course she is.  She's working.  She's got the same job she's had.  That's what we're talking about.  She's working at the same place she's worked at for how long?  Yeah.  She's a stand-in for Shrek.  Let's not pretend she's on a pig, too. 
[01:42:30]  Exactly.  Shrek.  She's at a theme park somewhere.  Yeah.  I'm going to put in a few more applications here.  Oh, shut up.  You're not.  We got the clip from nine years ago.  Where are you going to go today to put in applications?  I don't know.  No, no, no.  Where are you going?  What?  Where are you going?  Yeah, today.  Where are you going?  I was thinking Family Dollar or something. 
[01:43:00]  You're going nowhere, that means.  Family Dollar.  Family Dollar, you have neither.  Ah, shit.  I was thinking about it.  Yeah.  No, that's great.  I think about doing things all the time.  When are you going to do it?  We talked to you weeks ago.  It's taken you weeks to think about the idea of working at Family Dollar.  You drove your husband to kiss a train just the way Michael kissed Fredo in The Godfather  2.  What? 
[01:43:30]  He was not my husband.  What was he?  The father of her child.  I remember that.  Oh, same thing.  He was not my husband.  Oh, sorry.  Isn't that funny?  He was a cow catcher and then he got hit by one.  Jesus.  No.  What?  I got over that.  Oh, yeah.  I'm glad you did.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Dike.  Good for you.  The train got over him.  You know.  What were you saying?  That was such a long time ago.  I got over it.  Oh, good for you.  We figured you'd pass by.  Right.  What was that? 
[01:44:00]  Isn't that ironic?  He got hit with a choo-choo and that seems to be all you do all day.  Choo.  Choo.  No.  What?  I'll choo-choo all day.  Oh, well.  I'm sorry.  I chewed last night.  I chewed on a day.  On your fucking roommate's ball sack?  Yeah.  You should chew on the fucking business end of a shotgun.  Why don't you chew on that?  The business end.  It does not.  Lady Di.  Yeah, Di.  Where are you going?  Where are you going? 
[01:44:30]  Why are you still trying?  Where are you going to get a job?  Don't do this.  Today.  What's your itinerary for today?  I told you either today or right now.  I'm going to make it official.  Either today or tomorrow.  I'm going to go over to Family Dollar and apply over there.  Yeah?  You made it official.  What are your qualifications?  Great.  What are you going to write on the application?  The qualifications is I'm a cashier.  All right.  You're a cashier.  How much money do you want to make?  And when it says, how much money are you looking for?  What are you putting in there?  A wage.  What are you putting in there?  I don't expect to make a high salary.  Really?  No. 
[01:45:00]  I don't expect that.  A family dollar?  A family dollar?  Yeah.  Family dollar.  Why?  What are you going to do for them?  You're going down the street for me.  What are you going to do for them?  I told you.  Cashier.  Oh, man.  Imagine being in line with this one.  How are you?  Just ring me up and shut the fuck up.  Get me out of this shithole store.  How are you?  Welcome to Family Dollar.  Welcome to our establishment.  If I may ring you up here. 
[01:45:30]  What have you purchased today, madame?  Oh, my goodness.  Ah, yes.  My good friend.  Mind if I have a nip off of this booze while you wait?  Do we have her contact info?  I don't drink when I'm working.  You don't work.  Exactly.  So you chose drinking.  I don't drink while I'm working.  That's like me saying I don't drink while I fly planes.  We know that she hasn't had a job in at least nine.  No, probably at any W, too, right? 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  So at least 12 years.  You haven't worked in 12 years.  You fucking burn it.  Well, I have worked.  Okay.  In 12 years, Opie.  I have worked.  What have you done?  Yes, I have.  Where?  Yes, I have.  Where?  All right.  Let me see.  Right after.  I used to work at a Dunkin' Donuts in Westfield.  How long?  How long?  Don't lie.  I was there for a good, like, eight months.  Oh, there it was eight months.  We believe you.  Yes, don't worry.  And then I couldn't afford my apartment, so I had to move back to Elizabeth. 
[01:46:30]  Is that where you suck dick for, um...  The rent?  For rent?  Well, the rent was pretty high over there.  It was pretty high in Westfield.  So I couldn't afford it.  She was homeless for a while and blowing homeless guys.  Yeah, you were blowing homeless guys.  Who lived in Elizabeth that you went back there?  Believe me.  Trust me.  I was not doing stuff like that.  Yeah, I can't.  You know what's funny?  Opie's rage is reverting back to 12 years ago, too.  Yes, yes. 
[01:47:00]  She's bringing out...  Holy fuck, it's frustrating.  Who lives with you?  That was the last job I had when I was living in Westfield.  Yeah.  That was the last job I had.  And how many years ago...  I had that before that, too.  How many years ago was that?  Oh, my God.  2004?  2004?  And then you got fired from the supermarket for the credit card scam.  Yeah, yeah, I got fired.  So why haven't you worked in...  Hold on.  Why haven't you worked in nine years?  I've been working for Dunkin' Donuts.  Why haven't you worked in nine years?  You know what?  I really... 
[01:47:30]  I can't tell you about that.  I really, really don't know.  Classified.  I know.  I don't know.  I haven't.  Can I take a guess?  What?  Because you're a drunken person, and your life is just...  You're running in circles, and you're wasting your life because you won't stop drinking.  Oh, my God.  You are wasting your life, aren't you?  Unless you enjoy the drinking that much.  But who does, right?  Right, Jimmy?  Yeah.  I mean, after a point...  Is this how you saw your life turning out?  Just having no job? 
[01:48:00]  Just drinking in the afternoon?  Like, is this what you saw for yourself?  No.  No.  Well, then why don't you do something about it?  I haven't been looking for jobs in nine years.  I have been looking.  But I had no success.  You're bullshitting...  How do you not have success looking for menial, minimum wage jobs for nine fucking years?  No one can't get a job in nine years.  Well, minimum wage is better than nothing.  I didn't...  That's true, Ant.  It is.  You know, that's a lot of money for some of us. 
[01:48:30]  She's missing my...  You're right.  Really?  Yeah, right?  One more thing.  Okay.  When I came back to Elizabeth, I found the job at the temp agency.  I worked there for a couple of years.  What'd you do?  Anything they told me to.  Now.  Wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I used to...  Were you a temp to hire?  I did some of that temp shit.  Go ahead, Diane.  No, no, no.  It was fine.  I had no problem with it.  But that's not what I asked.  She answers questions that aren't being asked, and she doesn't answer questions that are being 
[01:49:00]  asked.  It's amazing.  I used to do assembly work for a temp agency.  They used to take...  Could you build something to stand on in a noose?  Assembly work?  Could you assemble that?  What would you...  You can't put anything together.  What would you assemble?  You can't even put a thought together.  You can't slap your life together.  What did you assemble?  Yes.  Assembly line?  Anything.  Clothes, whatever.  Put them in boxes and stuff like that.  You know, put the tags on them and put them back in the boxes and seal them up and stuff 
[01:49:30]  like that.  That's what I used to do for the temp agency.  Seriously.  Well, we weren't questioning.  No one thought that you were lying.  No, no, no.  I mean, I'm telling you, that's what I used to do.  All right.  Great.  You answered a question.  Yeah, well.  So, and that job was on the books, so, you know, we're good.  But, and then after that, where did I go after that?  Let me see.  After the temp agency, I'm trying to think right now. 
[01:50:00]  Oh, who's in the background?  Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Yeah, the guy, you can see.  Is he stirring?  Is that Bill in the background?  Is Bill stirring?  Well, Bill is, yeah, he's in the kitchen.  Yeah.  Can we talk to Bill?  Have you guys talked to Bill yet?  Yeah.  Yeah, we talked to Bill.  He's a man of few words.  Wow, okay.  Hold on, hold on.  Yeah, put him on.  Let me talk to you, Bill.  Come on, Bill.  They want to talk to you for a little bit.  He's doing paperwork.  He can't talk.  What kind of paperwork is he doing?  What is he doing?  What kind of paperwork?  Do you have to get your shots? 
[01:50:30]  Huh?  Is there a lawsuit because you bit a neighbor?  He said money paperwork.  He's busy.  What kind of paperwork?  What's he filling out paperwork for?  What a weird house.  It's weird.  Yeah.  Huh?  For what money?  It doesn't mean anything.  He's applying to the state for the right to raise a wild animal.  I have a wild boar in every sense of the word in my house.  Wild and crashing.  He's busy right now, so he can't talk. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah, he's very busy.  As you do nothing.  Yes, I have a boar here, and he's spelling it both ways.  I'm trying to think after the...  Hold on, hold on.  I'll have to ask him this.  Maybe you'll remember.  Go ahead.  Bill, where did I work after the temp agent?  All of a sudden, you're going to hear suey.  Where?  Oh, yeah, that's right.  What did he say?  I was a crossing guard.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  A crossing guard.  Believe me, I almost forgot about that. 
[01:51:30]  Isn't that volunteer work?  Yeah, it was.  Does that pay?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, it does.  And how did you lose that job?  Were you having a great day at work until you got distracted and heard a dull thud?  And realized you were going to be out of a gig?  Watch a little patent leather shoe skip across the pavement.  Something like that happened.  Exactly.  Did you see a Curious George book skid across the fucking pavement after a thud?  She's answering this.  Who answers jokes?  Were you babbling at someone and then you heard a fucking screech of tires and a horn? 
[01:52:00]  No.  No.  Did you see a school bus go over what looked like a speed bump that you didn't realize was there?  No.  No, of course.  Answer the jokes, please.  Keep answering it.  I was usually very good on the job.  How did you lose that job?  Yeah.  Honestly, you were drinking.  I don't want to talk about that part.  What happened?  What happened?  Come on, lady.  Stop playing coy.  Stop.  You gave us nothing today.  What happened?  Your life's an open book here. 
[01:52:30]  Be open and honest.  What happened to the crossing of our job?  Okay.  I'm probably going to get in trouble for that.  No, I can't.  No, I can't.  No, I can't.  No, I can't.  Well, there was one time, okay, I called in sick a couple of times.  Yeah.  Because you had too much free time in between.  She's lying.  All right.  No, I'm not.  I'm not.  Well, you're not what?  All right.  I used to call in sick.  I called in sick too much and they got tired of it and they let me go.  But why is Bill saying don't say it? 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  Well, that's what he did not want me to say.  Why?  Because I called in sick too many times.  I had too much free time in between.  And why were you calling in sick for an easy job?  I guarantee you she was getting drunk after the morning shift.  She was getting drunk.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I just called in sick because sometimes it was winter time and everything like that and  I just didn't feel like going out there and stuff like that and they just got sick of it.  So basically you were a lazy lump that couldn't go out twice a day.  You just wanted to sit in the house on your big fat ass and do nothing. 
[01:53:30]  I don't have a big fat ass.  Yeah, you don't.  God.  That I can guarantee.  You do.  These ladies have a very long back.  Oh, man.  Yeah, very long back.  Thanks a lot, Jim.  But I think that you're just languishing in this horrible place in your life.  I don't.  Hold on a second.  I don't have a flat ass.  Did Bill say you had a flat ass?  Oh, he just did.  He just said that.  Bill rules.  Yeah, we love Bill.  That's why Bill fucks your face. 
[01:54:00]  He doesn't want to look at the back of you.  Bill just said you have a flat ass.  No, no, no.  He doesn't.  No, we don't do that.  We don't do that.  You admitted it last phone call.  You admitted last time that he comes in your mouth.  Stop it.  That he fucking ejaculates in that face of yours.  Shut you guys up.  You gobble it down like custard.  Yeah.  Yeah, I do.  Oh, my God.  You're just.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm going to be sick.  What?  Another 8,000 times you might be human.  Okay.  Yeah.  Puke. 
[01:54:30]  All right.  Well, listen, guys, you've got to let me go.  Why?  What do you have to do?  Why?  Well, right now, I just wanted to find out if you're going to be around on the 28th.  We're going to stop over.  Yes.  What do you have to do today that you've got to get off the phone?  That's all I wanted to know.  What do you have to do today that you've got to get off the phone?  I have to go out in a little bit.  For what?  I told you, I'm going to go over to Family Dollar and see if I can apply for a job.  What a terrible cycle she's in.  It's just an awful life.  But she doesn't even know she's in a terrible cycle. 
[01:55:00]  No, no.  It's an awful life.  Good for her.  Lady Di, when you walk into Dollar, when you walk into Family Dollar to get a job, what's  the first thing you're going to say?  What do you say to them when you walk in?  I'm not going to say anything.  You go in front of a computer.  I told you that.  What are you talking about?  You probably apply differently now than you used to.  You go in front of a computer.  Because they don't want to deal with these idiots.  Right.  They just weed them out instantly.  Right.  That's what you do.  That's the way it works right now.  You go right in front of a computer and then you apply for a job.  You don't have to talk to anybody or do anything. 
[01:55:30]  I'm reading.  It says Family Dollar does not have computer applications.  That's somebody here online.  Yes, they do.  Yeah.  Do they?  They do.  They do.  Another person saying they're clueless.  Clueless.  When you come into the door.  What does she do during the day?  What's your day look like when you're not looking for a job, which is every day?  For nine years.  I mean, we could go back that far.  And I'm sure it went back a lot further than that.  What do you do?  What's a typical day in your life? 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  Go.  Well, right now it's just watching TV.  Until I get a phone call.  Ain't that America?  That's great.  You and me.  Well, what do you want me to tell you?  I don't know what to tell you.  Spending daddy's money.  Yeah, just don't you.  You know, we were fired for a while.  I got sick of not working.  There's only so much TV you can watch before it starts driving you nuts.  What else do you do during the day?  I know.  Well, I'm watching Match Game right now. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, there you go.  Yeah, that's the show you can watch at 8 o'clock.  Lady Di is so fat and lazy.  I am not fat and lazy.  That she doesn't even get up to take a blank.  She doesn't even get up to take a blank.  Charles Nelson Reilly writing in his answer.  It's Brett Summers jotting down hers.  Richard Dawson almost done. 
[01:57:00]  Why would you watch Match Game?  I love that show.  Of course you do.  All right, so after you watch TV, then what do you do?  Typical day.  Sometimes I take a nap.  It's a hard day watching TV.  It's ice cream.  And then sometimes, well, I have to go up.  I got to do a couple of things today.  I already told you what I'm going to do.  Like what?  What else?  What else are you leaving the house to do besides dollar, family dollar?  Oh, I got to get my hair cut. 
[01:57:30]  Really?  Why?  Number one.  Well, I have to get my hair cut.  Do you bring your own salad bowl or do they supply it at the fucking place you go?  No, no, no.  There's no salad bowl.  Believe me, they have to.  She isn't on a salad bowl.  Why do you have to get your...  That's what I only have to do is go down the street.  There's a beauty parlor right there.  Beauty parlor?  What are you doing there?  She'll be at the funeral parlor.  Get a haircut.  Wait, do you actually go in for your haircut or do they just do it when your head is dipped  and you're eating oats? 
[01:58:00]  No.  All right.  So, lady died.  It's just endless.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The point here is it's just endless.  It is.  Marion and I miss you guys.  Oh, good for you.  What do you do?  They should do her hair.  They should give her the old JFK.  We'll see you next Friday, okay?  Oh, great.  Looking forward to it.  I got pissed anyway.  All right.  So, uh...  We heard you.  We'll see you next Friday.  Yes, Friday.  How long do you have to wrap a call up for?  I'll see you Friday. 
[01:58:30]  Goodbye.  Next Friday.  See you next Friday.  Okay.  Take care.  All right.  You too.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Wait.  What a fucking moose.  Dude, that was a time machine call.  Yes.  That was like we went back in time.  I just heard it.  And there she was.  Like, oh, that's the same shit.  And then Iraq found the clip.  Yes.  Holy fuck.  And Iraq, you probably didn't even have to really look for that one.  That was the beginning.  For that one.  Yeah.  I was just looking for lady die call. 
[01:59:00]  Right.  And then skim through it.  Oh, there it is.  And it's going to be the same call.  Right.  It was exact, except our voices were certainly a bit different.  Yes.  There was a little more exuberance in my voice.  A little more hope.  A little more exuberance.  Exuberance.  Some youthful exuberance.  That's the only difference in that phone call from today.  A bit of exuberance.  What a disaster that woman is.  Her whole life.  God.  But she's living like a rock star in her fucking brain. 
[01:59:30]  That's what's good.  You know, it's people like her that have to make, like, terminally ill people just so angry.  Grateful.  You're going to have to deal with her.  It's like, there's a waste of a life.  Right.  She's doing nothing with it.  What?  Johnny Resnick's on MSNBC.  He used to do our show, huh?  Fucking Googie Dolls.  Oh, is that it?  The Googie Dolls.  Good.  Probably get him.  He looks like he's had some work done. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, his face looks very plastic.  And then what's his name still dressed like that?  I forgot his name.  Robbie?  Yeah, I think you're right.  Robbie.  The fat one.  Wow.  We worked at the same radio station in Buffalo before the Googie Dolls hit.  Dude, he looks like Michael Jackson.  Who?  Fucking Googie Doll.  The main Googie Doll, Johnny?  Yeah, look.  He's got, like, a cleft chin.  Yeah, what is he doing to his face?  He fucking did something.  He just looks bizarre.  Try to look younger. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  Ain't working.  Out.  And he was saying for the first time in all, you know, all the songs that he's written,  he was saying, it's so much better.  What are they doing this interview for on MSNBC?  I don't know.  This is a weird one from MSNBC.  They think this is going to be the real ratings grabber that they've been lacking?  I don't know.  They performed name acoustically on our show back in the day.  Oh, yeah.  It was pretty cool, actually.  I remember that.  I like those guys, but I don't know.  I'm going to go wee-wee with Jimmy.  Can I wee, too? 
[02:01:00]  Yes.  Let's all wee-wee together.  We've got Steve coming in.  Steve Burns here.  Amy Schumer in a few minutes.  Great.  Yeah.  All right, then.  Let's do it!  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:01:30]  All right, good.  Jesus.  All right.  Anyway.  Fuck.  Yeah, we were just talking about Lady Di.  We don't understand how anyone could just answer jokes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think we all fuck up.  Someone says a line, and you kind of answer it, maybe.  But she answers every single joke.  Hey, Lady Di, you're a fucking woolly mammoth.  Where are your tusks?  I don't have tusks.  No.  No, no.  No tusks here.  I don't have tusks. 
[02:02:00]  All right, Lady Di.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, Lady Di, you look like the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.  I'm not the marshmallow.  I'm not made of marshmallow.  No.  No.  You fucking retard.  He really is just so fucking stupid.  We're Steve Byrne, man.  He's outside.  We're going to get Steve Byrne in.  Kenny, can you bring Steve in?  Oh, there you go.  What's up, Steve?  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We, uh...  How are you?  We're good, buddy.  We're good, man.  Thanks for having me.  I appreciate it.  No problem. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, there you go.  We held you back.  We got the drop-down headphones there.  There you go.  Oh, Chris Rock is here.  What are you going to do?  No.  We held you back for the retard.  Oh.  That's even worse.  Yeah.  That's why I'm bringing you up.  That's what I get to follow.  It's fine.  Yeah, yeah.  It's only up from here.  It's amazing.  Oh, now your mic is falling out.  This is just...  What a fucking piece of shit arrangement we got here.  It really is amazing how somebody so dysfunctional as she is  can be so fucking captivating.  The worse somebody is, the more interesting they are to talk to. 
[02:03:00]  People love hearing you.  It's the frustration of the whole thing.  Idiot.  Steve doesn't even know any of this, but whatever.  Yeah, he understands.  Are you a hockey fan or are you just wearing the hoodie?  Huge hockey fan, yeah.  Who do you got?  Huge hockey fan.  Well, I'm from Pittsburgh, so...  Oh, fuck.  Just hard break city.  They get smoked.  It was embarrassing.  It's one thing to lose, but to get smoked like that and just embarrassed,  but what are you going to do?  They were the weaker team.  What are you going to do?  Who do they lose to?  I don't watch hockey.  They beat my Islanders, though, so...  Hey, the Islanders are penguin killers.  Yeah.  You guys killed us in 93. 
[02:03:30]  We were going to three-peat.  Right.  We had a pretty good series against you guys, too, this year.  Yeah, you killed it.  It's funny.  Every time I see Chris Rock, I think of his brother, Tony,  because Tony...  Like, you would sit at the table at the cellar with Chris.  I'd sit with Tony, because I follow retards on the radio, so...  But I remember when I first...  Like, I first went out to Los Angeles, I hung out with Tony,  and he showed me around, and he was on that Will Smith sitcom.  Right, right, right.  And I'd just come out to L.A., and he's like,  Yeah, let's hang out. 
[02:04:00]  We'll go get some lunch, and then we'll go to the...  He's like, I got to go get a bed.  You want to go get a bed with me?  I was like, Yeah, I'll go to the mattress store,  and we'd pick out a bed.  So we'd get him this bed, and then the next week,  we're at the comedy cellar, and he's back in New York,  and I see him, and I remember he was reading this newspaper,  and my bag was over in the corner.  I go, Hey, can you throw my bag to me?  And he took my bag, and he threw it over.  He just took it and threw it, and my camera was in there,  and it dropped, and I was like, Hey, dude, what the fuck?  So then I go over, and at the cellar, you know, it's kind of mean,  so I went over to the newspaper.  I just palmed it, and I crunched it up, 
[02:04:30]  and I threw it in the garbage can.  I didn't realize it was an article on him,  so he was pissed.  So he jumped up, and he started swinging at me,  and he started, like, punching me.  I guess he used to box or whatever,  and Ben Bailey came over and broke us up.  I remember that.  And I was laughing.  I go, Dude, are you serious?  He's like, I'm going to fuck you up.  Brooklyn's in the house.  Brooklyn's in the house.  Oh, wow.  And he kept doing, Brooklyn's in the house.  I'm going to come kick your ass.  You haven't seen the last of me.  And I don't know why I said this,  but he was all the way at the other end of the cellar,  and I was by the table.  I go, Hey, man, I helped you pick out a bed. 
[02:05:00]  And I was like, Why did that come out of my mouth?  Of all the things.  And Ben Bailey turned around and goes, Really?  That's what y'all.  Embarrassing.  Did you guys make up after that?  Yeah, the next day he was like, Hey, I'm sorry.  No problem.  I like Tony Rock.  Tony Rock is a weird guy,  because I had a lot of meals with him at the Comedy Cellar,  and I thought, like, he, nobody treated their fucking food better than Tony Rock did. 
[02:05:30]  I really, dude, I would watch Tony Rock.  Yeah.  Like, this guy, I guess because he grew up in a house with a lot of people or whatever,  this guy appreciates food.  Like, he was like making love.  He would pull his burger,  and the way he would dress that burger up and put the ketchup on, perfect.  I've never heard of this.  And he would eat with perfect, he was a perfect eating machine.  Tony Rock ate food like nobody I've ever seen.  All that was missing was an ascot.  An absolute gentleman when he ate.  I've never seen anybody appreciate their food more than that guy. 
[02:06:00]  I don't know why, but I think of him eating a burger every time I think of Tony Rock.  It's so true.  He would spend ten minutes preparing his fucking burger,  making sure the lettuce was just so,  and the ketchup was just so,  and the right amount of mustard, and fluffing it.  That guy did not take food for granted.  What a psychopath.  But he's a guy who appreciates his food.  I respect that.  That's a guy that doesn't waste food.  That's when you pat your lips with a napkin.  Yeah, just the little pat.  The proper brit.  The dab on the corners.  Our experiences with Tony were very different. 
[02:06:30]  I watched him eat a burger,  and he swung at your face after bed shopping.  We've got to ask you about the altercation with the cab driver.  That was in April, right?  Yeah, that was big news.  It was big news.  It was huge news.  We heard about it.  That means it's big news.  Yeah, when you, yeah.  Well, you know, it's a pending legal thing,  so I don't know how much I can say,  but, you know, it's one of those things.  But basically, my jaw got a large shit for six weeks,  which is a brutal process. 
[02:07:00]  But I think, you know, knowing that you know about it,  you guys read about it,  I think everybody discovered I am literally the only Asian actor  working in Hollywood that does not know martial arts.  is what I discovered.  It's just brutal, and I wouldn't wish it on anybody.  What happened that day?  And obviously be careful because of the lawsuit.  What can you say?  Well, he, look, I know this.  I don't know if I'm, I don't know what I'm supposed to say or not,  but I never touched the guy.  I never touched the guy.  It was, you know, I don't know what the legal term is. 
[02:07:30]  But why were you mad?  Or was he mad?  He was, he was mad.  I don't know exactly.  He was mad.  No, I think we can do this, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What was he mad at?  Or what do you think he was mad at?  Basically, this is what it was.  He was, he spent five minutes finishing a cigarette.  And my friend and I were teasing, like, you know,  are you finally done with the cigarette?  Because we were, you know, it's a cab line.  So we're waiting to get in a cab.  Gotcha. 
[02:08:00]  And, you know, we're like, hey, can we get in a cab?  I got to finish the cigarette.  And then it's like, we're just waiting, waiting.  Hey, can we just jump in another cab?  Hold on.  I'm next.  You wait, you wait.  And then that's how it started.  And then it's just like, are you finally done with this?  And then boom.  And he punched you.  Yeah.  Wow.  And it was just one shot.  Well, I guess I said it now.  So that's pretty much it.  No, but that's not going to fuck up your case.  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  That's exactly what you're going to say in court.  A guy strikes you for that?  That's totally uncalled for. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  So what would he say?  Clocked.  Well, he actually, I don't know.  I don't know what I'm supposed to say.  Yeah, that part might be a little sketchy, but.  Yeah, he, he, he went to the, better to not say, you know, I don't see fucking, but let's  you say this.  He belted you without, and you had done physically nothing to him.  Right.  That's correct.  And, uh, it was, I, I, you know, you know, it just, it was a horrible experience.  It was a horror, it was just liquid diet.  And it knocked you down. 
[02:09:00]  Knocked you out?  No, no.  I, I, it happened and I, my head just snapped back.  And as soon as my head snapped, I didn't go down or anything.  You know, I don't know if that's man code or whatever, but I felt good.  Yeah.  But I didn't expect anything.  But as soon as it happened, just the jaw was split.  Oh, so basically my right side was fine.  My left side was hanging.  You could like do a little flap thing with it.  No.  And I thought I actually lost a tooth at the time.  So as soon as it happened, your instinct is to go after the guy.  But I just said, something's wrong here.  Something's really wrong here. 
[02:09:30]  And my, my friend, Gareth Reynolds, who's another comedian, he goes, Hey, you just hit  my friend.  So the cab driver started wailing on, on him.  Wow.  And I remember Gareth was commentating everything.  He goes, now you're hitting me.  You're hitting me like this.  It's like, dude, you're just commenting on it.  Why don't you get him back?  Yeah, yeah, do something.  If I didn't do anything, I was, I was done.  Did anybody jump in and help?  The other cab drivers pulled him off and basically he tried to, he tried to take off.  So I jumped in front of the cab.  I started snapping pictures and that's how I, with a broken jaw, you jumped in front 
[02:10:00]  of his cab.  Yeah.  Wow.  Steve's ballsy.  Wow.  So your jaw was wired for how long?  Six weeks?  Six weeks.  Yeah.  And how much did it hurt when it first happened?  Look, it was painful.  You can't, you know, all the things you take for granted.  You can't yawn.  You can't sneeze.  Not yawning would kill me, believe it or not.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Yeah.  Especially when you're waiting for the retard to wrap up.  Yeah.  And was it like, like, ooh.  It literally is like that, yeah.  That's awkward.  You're ooh, trying to yawn with a. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  And just all the muscles, you feel them tensing up in your mouth and then you feel the roots  of your teeth and just the pain that shivers through your.  Oh my God.  The worst part is watching television.  You know, I'm watching NHL playoffs and I just keep seeing these commercials for Golden  Corral and the wings that they have and the Texas peat sauce and I'm going crazy.  Absolutely crazy.  But you can't eat.  It's all liquid diet.  Yeah.  Oh, that's terrible.  Amy Schumer.  I lost 15 pounds.  No.  It's Amy.  What's up, Amy? 
[02:11:00]  How are ya?  Good, how are you?  Nice to see ya.  I don't know, man.  He's talking about getting his jaw broken.  His jaw wired shut.  I was just bragging about it.  What about that?  A cab driver?  Yeah.  Fuck.  Yeah.  That's fucking crazy.  No, they'll also finger you.  They will.  You both have really hot cab stores.  What the fuck?  So then you're just drinking shit through a straw for six weeks?  Just drinking, just all liquid diet, you know.  And I was plummeting in weight, so I was blending milkshakes and throwing cupcakes and cookies in there to just put it back on. 
[02:11:30]  Which is what Bobby Kelly does, I think.  Yeah, that's normal.  It's fine.  As soon as you said cupcake.  What was the first thing you ate when your jaw got fixed?  A jawbreaker?  Yeah.  Hard candy?  Oh, pizza.  I had pizza.  Okay, that seems easy.  I had to do it, yeah.  Because I got to get those muscles working again.  Yeah, it took a while to even get back to eating.  Like, I had my first steak like a week ago.  Wow.  It's been a few weeks since then, but it was just horrible.  But the guy just seemed like a problem. 
[02:12:00]  Well, I'm sorry?  Like, from the start, did the guy seem like a...  Yeah, when he wanted to finish his cigarette, and, you know, it's not how a business should conduct itself.  Did we already ask where race he was?  We didn't mention that.  He looked like a villain in a Taken film, or any Jean-Claude Van Damme, some Western European...  I guess Eastern European, it depends which...  The white cab drivers are the scariest ones.  Period.  Yeah, you're right.  Period.  What happened?  What went wrong here?  I had one of these fucking, one of those rickshaw bicycle pedicab guys give me shit. 
[02:12:30]  Nothing worse than standing there, you're hailing a cab, and a parade of these pedal cabs come by, and it's like...  And I'm like, yeah, I'm going to Brooklyn, asshole.  You're going to pedal my fucking ass across the bridge.  You'll find one that will, though.  Dummy?  Yeah, there's probably always one that will do it.  You know, I did that job when I lived in Santa Barbara.  I was a rickshaw driver.  Oh, did you really?  I swear.  Oh, Amy. 
[02:13:00]  I was dating this deadbeat guy that had no money, and so I worked for both of us, driving a pedicab up and down.  Would people actually have destinations, or would they just make you ride in a circle while they just jerked off?  I love it.  It would have been so much better.  They had destinations, and I sucked at it.  I would, like, be riding up a hill, and I'd feel I was losing momentum, and I'd be like, get everybody out, and then we'd all have to push it up the hill.  Wow, that was a bad thing.  Just every eight minutes getting smacked on the back of the neck.  Is it raining out? 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  I wish.  That would have been so flattering.  Like, things were not looking good at that time.  No.  No, I didn't know they were like 20.  Between the two of us, honestly, who would you in Vegas go, someone drove a rickshaw?  Yeah, yeah.  The Asian or Amy, but I can't believe you were.  Yeah, definitely.  Yeah, that's right.  You're only part Asian, though.  Yeah.  Korean and Irish.  Yeah.  Oh, you got the Irish in you.  Okay.  All right.  Come on, man.  That makes sense now.  The whole story makes sense now.  Jimmy's Irish, too.  Well, it's Murphy's Law.  Yeah, right.  Yeah.  Jimmy's got a little Irish in him. 
[02:14:00]  Ah, going to the gym.  Going to the gym.  Eaching better.  Eaching better.  We've got to play for Amy.  Where's the clip?  Don't say any more.  Hold on.  All right.  E-Rock's going to find it, but.  Yeah.  Ozzy was it.  Oh, the pedal cab guys, though, here in Manhattan.  Right.  They're like these Russian guys, like a lot of them.  Make a living.  And one after another.  And by the third one, I just went like, no, I don't.  And the guy, he goes, you give me a fucking problem? 
[02:14:30]  And like he was getting off his little bicycle to come after me.  Right.  But that's the thing.  You don't want to fight.  I'm in the street like, oh, man.  You don't want to fight one of those guys, because they're in shape.  Yes.  Although he was right on the back for a living.  So you can't even run away from him.  His endurance is like fucking a decapitalon.  Stand alone.  You're done.  What finally happened?  I'd have had to shoot him.  He's dead.  He's dead.  I just went like, get the fuck out of here.  And another one of the cab guys kind of held him back. 
[02:15:00]  And there were a shitload of cops.  It was Times Square.  I had an issue with one of those guys, too, where me and my ex-girlfriend were across  on the street, and he was just kind of staring at her, like really hard staring at her.  So I'm staring at him.  And he's like, well, you're looking.  I'm like, you're fucking staring at my girlfriend.  And we got up to each other.  He got off the cab.  They'll throw.  They'll throw down.  They're not like medallion cab guys that know, like, I could get in a lot of trouble.  But no, he didn't want to.  I didn't either, but he didn't want to.  And that was the end of it.  We just walked away.  I mean, it was.  Yeah.  Well, more importantly, this is Ramey Schumer and Steve Byrne. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, this is so good.  You know, don't even say what happened.  Can I wear your sweatshirt?  Yeah.  Oh.  You're freezing.  Yeah.  No, I just want something of Jimmy's on my skin.  Oh.  That is good.  Like AIDS.  Thank you.  So we all know that Jimmy loves Ozzy.  Ozzy was in here.  And this is how the interview started.  Just listen very closely, Amy Schumer.  It's a quick clip.  Ozzy Osbourne.  How you doing, Ozzy?  Take a seat, my friend. 
[02:16:00]  Hello.  Hi, guys.  What's up, man?  Take a seat.  Yeah, Jimmy lost a lot of weight.  Just going to the gym.  Just going to the gym and eating better.  That's it.  Look at Amy's face.  I don't know.  Look at Amy's face.  I don't know.  I can't listen to it anymore.  It's so embarrassing.  I don't know.  It's so hard.  He turned it like Irish English.  I just panicked.  I don't know.  It's going to the gym.  It's going to the gym.  Do you think about it? 
[02:16:30]  It's Jimmy like, well, they're getting it.  No.  I never do that.  And it went right away.  It literally went.  And then it went away.  Right away.  I had a moment of panic.  That made my skin crawl.  Yes.  And you know Oprah interviews a black guest.  Yes.  Now I feel comfortable.  Now she's like, now I'm comfortable.  Now I'll open up.  That's right, honey.  Yeah, yeah.  But you know what's even more cringing?  Hearing it a second time.  Yeah.  I hope Steve loves so much.  Why is the gym?  Yeah, Jimmy lost a lot of weight. 
[02:17:00]  Just going to the gym.  Just going to the gym and eating better.  What the fuck is that?  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's terrible.  Oh, my God.  Just going to the gym and eating better.  That really is.  What do you think?  It's just the grossest thing you can do.  It's truly terrible.  But it was.  What a meaty boy.  No, it was.  Dad's here.  Blank me.  Dad's here.  I'm like, you, Papa.  Oh, my gosh.  But I immediately got out of it. 
[02:17:30]  Thank God.  Thank God.  Yeah, yeah, that's just.  You want to hear it one more time?  Sure.  Yeah, sure.  Just to make sure.  Just in case we miss something.  Just to make sure we got it.  Yeah, Jimmy lost a lot of weight.  Just going to the gym.  Just going to the gym and eating better.  It's like Kevin Costner in Robin Hood.  But for just 10 seconds.  Right, yes.  Eating better.  That is so uncomfortable. 
[02:18:00]  That's what I said.  You hurt me, you fuck.  No, it was.  It was.  I just.  I couldn't believe he recognized that I lost.  I just panicked.  So you had to turn English, Scottish, Irish.  It was just.  I was talking like that.  It was.  You did better.  That is fun.  That your idol noticed that you.  That is cool.  That he did.  That was the weird part for me.  Because I had seen him like two weeks before that.  He's like, what are you doing?  You lost so much weight.  And I didn't know how.  I just like couldn't believe that he recognized.  Not only recognized it, but knew I had lost weight. 
[02:18:30]  Cutting down on the bangers and mash.  How needy.  Little Ozzy.  It really is.  It really is an insight into what a fucking complete worm I am.  Just completely.  Little English worm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, it's so embarrassing to hear.  I love it.  I have it on my phone.  And every so often I just.  That way.  It's.  I'm drawn to it.  Yeah.  That was so awful. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  We're all loving inside Amy Schumer, man.  Holy fuck, man.  Oh, my God.  It's so great.  Did you do me and Kenny interview?  Of course I did.  The Kenny interview was brilliant.  We loved the Kenny interview.  That was my favorite interview of the season.  You guys had some energy, man.  Oh, the rapport.  He just.  It was great.  I mean, talk about making your skin crawl.  Really.  And then Anthony's episode is going to be on.  Oh, yeah.  Not this week, but next week.  Then the week after.  Oh, very excited.  Oh, I love turning. 
[02:19:30]  I love turning the show on because it's like, hey, it's everyone I know.  I know.  It's everyone I know is on this show.  It's great.  Because everyone else said no.  I guess Tom.  Tom Papa has been on a couple of times, I guess.  No.  He was just on once.  Was he on once?  Yeah.  That one with the.  We're in the.  In the restaurant.  Very funny.  He was so good at being like the worst.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Whenever I need to cast.  Like, okay.  I need the worst person imaginable.  I just call.  Yeah.  One of our friends.  They're all in your Rolodex.  Florentine was great. 
[02:20:00]  Metzger.  Metzger.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  I was booked on the show, but I got replaced by the retard.  See what happens again.  Guys.  Again.  It happens.  Sorry.  It's okay.  I don't know what's wrong with Stevie.  He's talking like Michael halfway through the Godfather.  After fucking Salasso got a hold of him.  I was watching tape on Dunham for six weeks.  That's all I was doing.  All right.  Could you talk while we're talking about Lena, right?  Yeah.  I could talk.  Yeah.  But it was just like this the whole time.  Not yawning. 
[02:20:30]  That made me claustrophobic when you said that.  You couldn't yawning.  Oh, man.  That's the perfect word for it.  You feel claustrophobic.  You're trapped inside.  But you can if you have to cut the wires.  You could, right?  You could.  You're supposed to carry wire cutters in case you throw up.  Because then you're going to die.  Oh, God.  You have to carry them with you.  Wire cutters?  Yeah.  What a dread.  How many wires would you have to cut?  That's like ping, ping, ping.  It's literally like that, though.  It's probably like a dozen.  Wow.  The worst is like when you have it happen, it's like there's these, you know, you're out  when you get them put in. 
[02:21:00]  You're unconscious?  Yeah.  When you're getting them off, you're conscious.  At least I was.  And it's like little fish hooks dug in between your teeth and your gum.  Oh, my God.  This is torturous.  It was painful getting them out.  And I was pretty medicated and numbed up.  But it was rough.  That is archaic.  You'd think they'd have something by now.  It's like, no, we still must wire your jaw shut.  But at least they fucking, I mean.  Put leeches on your cheeks.  It happens to fighters sometimes. 
[02:21:30]  You know.  Yeah.  Fuck, yeah.  Fighters?  Yeah, fighters.  Fighters.  It happens to fighters.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, the bare knucklers.  You're married, right?  No.  Married, yeah.  Did you have a gym?  Nobody's worried about you getting married.  Stop flirting.  Did you guys have sex while you were, like, what was that like?  No, I felt ugly.  No, seriously.  No, I mean, I really, I just, I just cocooned my, I just. 
[02:22:00]  I just stayed, I was, like, depressed.  Yeah, no shit.  I did the Mr. Mom.  I grew my beard out.  Yeah, just.  Put the whoopee away, Kenny was just, it was a brutal.  Gave up.  Yeah, it was a brutal experience.  What do you do if you have to yawn or breathe through your mouth?  I am very stuffy.  So what do you do if you have to breathe through your mouth?  Why wouldn't you be able to do that?  Breathe through your mouth?  You can, I mean, your mouth still works.  Yeah.  You can't open it.  Like your lips are wired shut.  Well, my lips still work, yeah.  I just can't chug dong anymore.  Yeah, that's what Jimmy's really asking.  Were your teeth together? 
[02:22:30]  Teeth were together.  And it just, you know, it sucks when you go out in public.  Oh, yeah, you can raise your mouth, can't you?  Yeah.  Just like, hey, can I get a coffee or whatever?  And they're like.  It's your problem.  And so my jaw's wired shut, I'm sorry.  And then they speak louder to you.  It's like.  That I never understood.  It's your fucking problem.  You got an attitude, man?  Yeah.  Relax.  No.  I am relaxed.  I can't talk.  Don't worry about it.  And then you don't want to start anything because you don't want to get hit again.  I'm like, oh my gosh, you never know if somebody's going to clock me again.  Yeah.  You must have post-traumatic stress a little bit. 
[02:23:00]  Well, I wasn't, you know, driving a Humvee in Iraq.  So I had like that.  But I mean, look.  Say you have that.  You avoid conflict.  It's going to help the fucking lawsuit.  No one likes being assaulted, though.  I mean, really.  Think about it.  It's something that takes something away from you as a human being.  It's such a violation.  Yes.  You should not be allowed to just hurt someone physically.  Yeah, without getting some pushback.  That's right, Jimmy.  Oh, Jimmy.  Jimmy.  That's sweet of you, Jim.  We're going to have it.  Spot on, Jim.  Who are you suing?  The cab driver? 
[02:23:30]  Sue everyone.  Are you suing everyone?  The city?  Everyone's going down.  Hollywood's going to know my name.  Yeah.  After him and the cab cab.  I don't know if I'm supposed to say this, but he left the country.  Wow.  So he left.  You didn't say that.  He pleaded the country.  Yeah, that's a fact.  He took off.  So how the hell are you getting...  I don't know.  Well, there's a cab company.  There's a cab company, I guess.  There's a cab company, and...  Was this L.A.?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Oh, you're going to make a couple mil.  Typical L.A.  Fucking L.A., right? 
[02:24:00]  Also, the studio, I'm sure, would want to take action because it cost them a lot of money.  Yeah, that was the worst part is that, you know, 15 years is a comic.  You work, and you get this opportunity.  And then I remember before I went under, I was looking at my wife, and I was on the  phone with Peter Billingsley, the executive producer, and he was online with TBS and the  executives there.  And they're like, hey, can you hold off on getting the operation?  We just want to get everything straightened out.  And the doctors look at me going, you got to do this.  You have to go under right now because every minute is another... 
[02:24:30]  It's a gaping wound.  You could get infected.  He's like, we got to take care of it right now.  I said, I'm sorry.  I got to get the operation done.  You guys got to do what you got to do.  And, you know, it's a testament, again, to TBS and Billingsley that they...  I mean, they made everything work.  And the T...  Look, TBS could have canceled the show, but...  No shit.  It's called Sullivan and Son, by the way, and it's on Thursdays at 10 o'clock on TBS.  That's not the way I want to get into the plot.  No, no, no, but we didn't mention it.  Thank you.  When did season two start?  Season two, it premiered last Thursday with Ken Jeong. 
[02:25:00]  You guys might know him as Mr. Chow.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know him as the Asian that set us back another six and a half inches.  Jesus Christ.  Jumping out of that trunk.  But, yeah, it's on every Thursday at 10 o'clock on TBS, 9 Central.  And Peter's a kid from Christmas Story, right?  Yeah, Peter's executive producer.  So, like, on our set, if you see the show, next to the jukebox, we have a little leg lamp.  Oh, the leg lamp is there.  And above the storage room, there's a license plate, a Pennsylvania license plate, for Vince. 
[02:25:30]  Vince Vaughn's our other producer, and it says Double Down on 11.  D-B-L-D-N-11.  You should make it happen on the craps, too.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, that's cool.  It's been a fun show, yeah.  How far from production were you when that happened?  We were three in.  So we filmed three episodes.  Oh, you had already started?  Oh, God.  Okay.  So it was crazy.  It was the one night I was literally doing everything right.  You know, I got a newborn child.  I didn't want to jeopardize anything.  I'm married.  Did you say, did you look up and say, nothing can go wrong now? 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  I'm going to get hit.  Wow, I'm on quite a ride.  I think you got a hold of everything.  Then all of a sudden it starts raining on me.  And, yeah, the summer storm.  Oh, my God.  It was brutal.  Jesus.  I was taking a cab.  I had four drinks.  I'm like, I'm not even going to chance it.  I'm going to do the right thing tonight.  Because I remember on Oprah here, you could have a drink and a half and get pulled over  and get...  I was like, ugh.  Which Oprah do you want?  You've got to blame Oprah on this one.  That's a lot of Oprah.  A lot of Oprah not.  I just remember that one episode.  Yeah.  It was that one.  But I remember when Chris Rock would be on. 
[02:26:30]  And then she'd...  Yeah, she would definitely get a little more ghetto.  She got a little more ghetto.  He was her most frequent guest.  I think Chris Rock did it more than almost anybody.  Yeah, he had like 25 Oprah appearances.  Man.  Jesus.  He was like the Rich Little of Oprah.  Yeah.  Rich Little.  Oh, that guy.  What to die for.  His impersonation.  I love when he turned around.  Turned back around.  And he's someone else.  It's magic.  I hate when he did Peter Sellers.  He's stunk as the Pink Panther.  He did a good Carson and a good bunch of other guys.  But, man, he did a fucking horrible Peter.  I never forgave him for that. 
[02:27:00]  He wasn't very good.  But I'm sorry.  He did a good Carson.  Yeah, but they were like from the same town or something is why he had that accent down  or some shit.  Hey, I personally...  I don't know what you can say.  You know, you probably don't want to say anything like that.  But me personally, I would want the guy dead.  Like, I would be obsessing over the fact that I would want that guy dead.  Go to his village.  Yes, yes.  I would fucking use money to hire a mercenary to have him killed.  Yeah, I think I'm with you.  It's like, I can't live with things like that. 
[02:27:30]  For years and years, that stupid Gabriel Mayer's kid from California that punched me in the  face in front of ShopRite.  Or, no, it was fucking thrifty drug and discount store.  You're still obsessing about that.  That fucker.  I went to school with him.  I went to school with him.  I was like fucking 14 or whatever it was.  And he's like, hey, give me a...  Let's slap box.  And I'm like, I didn't want to do that.  And I'm like, okay, I don't know what he's doing.  He's smacking me in the face.  And he went to smack and I pull back. 
[02:28:00]  And then I come back and there's a giant fist waiting for me.  Bam!  Right in my eye.  Why did he do that?  Because he's a fucking asshole.  And then I'm on the sidewalk, bleeding from the eye.  And I just hear him going, ha, ha, ha, laughing.  And I'm like...  And then for years, I'm like, I want him dead.  I still want him dead.  You should kill him.  Dead!  I wouldn't say that on a big radio show.  Ah, whatever.  He's dead.  Fuck him.  What's he doing now?  Or this one.  Jimmy.  But if you guys got that one. 
[02:28:30]  You got that one that lingers.  This will be my one.  Of course, that's your one.  Boy, oh, man.  You think that's your one?  Hopefully that's your one.  Hopefully that's my one, yeah.  But yeah, that's one of those things that happens.  And it's like, you can't plan for that.  Some guy's just going to fucking react like a psychopath to a minor altercation.  Yeah.  But look, you know, every guy, I think you have one.  And then you have another one that's the opposite.  You have one where you got the better of it.  But you focus on missing talent in the back.  I don't think I have that.  Or you've avoided one that you'll never know. 
[02:29:00]  I figure I've avoided...  I remember one time I was on the subway.  And a guy across from me, I had on...  I was just kind of sitting there with my sunglasses.  I think he thought I was staring at him.  Because, you know, with sunglasses, you can't tell.  He was a big black dude.  And so he's looking at me across.  And he took his sunglasses.  And he fucking aimed them down.  And eyeballed me over them.  Oh.  And I realized what was happening in that moment.  Like, this guy thinks I'm staring at him down.  So you said, what the fuck are you looking at?  It's like the poster risky business.  But he didn't want to fuck you.  No.  But I played that over my head for, like, many times. 
[02:29:30]  But I'm like, I'm glad I didn't do anything.  Because, A, I wasn't eyeballing him.  Yeah.  So I would have reacted to something wrong.  And, B, he looked like he had just come off Rikers Island.  Yeah.  I was coming from doing a fun radio show.  Ooh.  We talked to the gals today.  Yeah.  I said, what would I have done there besides getting my fucking job?  Yeah, you're all amped up for a fight.  But I don't go out and fucking pick physical altercations.  No, no.  Sometimes, like, I remember I was working in Phoenix.  And we finished a show.  And I was with Sebastian Maniscalco.  I don't know if you guys know that.  He's a great guy. 
[02:30:00]  Super nice guy.  His accent's not strong enough for my life.  All right.  You can't let John do it.  But I met these girls.  We brought them back.  We went swimming and stuff.  We, you know, we had some fun.  So the girls are leaving.  And I'm like, hey, I'll go walk them back to the elevator.  So I go to walk them to the elevator.  And Sebastian's like, I don't know, I'll walk them in the elevator.  So I go walk them in.  The guy.  And I catch up to them.  And the girls are in the elevator.  There's five guys outside the elevator, all black guys. 
[02:30:30]  And they're holding the elevator door.  And they're like, come on, girl.  Give me the number.  Give me the number.  Give me a number.  He's like, I'm not giving you my number.  It goes on for a few minutes.  I go under the arm.  I go, all right, guys.  I don't blame you.  They're pretty girls.  I'd be doing the same thing.  But let's call it a night here.  Oh, no.  And the guy keeps going, give me a number.  You can't handle this floss.  And he's holding up his bling or whatever.  And even the buddy's tapping on the shoulder like, buddy, it's over.  Let's go.  He will not let it go.  This goes on for two minutes.  I'm not joking.  The beeping thing on the elevator is going off.  I'm going, Jesus Christ.  Just please, God, let this end.  Just give him the number. 
[02:31:00]  The girl goes, give him a fake number or something.  The girl goes, look, you.  And she dropped the n-bomb.  I ain't giving you my number.  Anthony wants a number.  He comes in.  I want a number.  Her friend walked out.  He comes in.  The door's shut.  He looked at me.  He grabbed me.  And I played hockey.  So I pulled the jersey over the head.  And I just started wailing on him.  Good move.  Because I'm thinking one of us is going down here.  You pulled the jersey over his head?  I pulled his shirt over his head.  I just started wailing on him.  And thank God black guys don't play hockey.  Yeah.  He went down. 
[02:31:30]  And I go, are you done?  Are you done?  He goes, I'm done.  I'm done.  But I didn't realize.  When we were moving around, the elevator shook so much, it stopped.  So we're stuck in the elevator now.  No.  She's crying.  And I remember Sarah Smiles by Hall & Oates was playing in the elevator.  I'm not joking.  Always a good one.  Always a good song.  So what finally happened?  He's on the ground.  You hit him.  He's done.  Now, did you help him up?  Or did he get up?  Then he was like, he goes, man, it's fucked up.  Yeah, it's pretty fucked up.  I was stuck in here. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  And we were stuck for like five or seven minutes.  And I was like, you know, you should have called him that.  He's like, hey, you know, I'm just a guy trying to hit some tail.  He's like, you look familiar.  And he recognized me from my BET set of me doing my Bruce Lee kung fu porno bit.  I swear to God.  I was like, yeah, I'm at the Tempe Improv.  You want tickets?  And he's like, yeah, maybe me and my boys will come.  That's great.  I swear to God.  That's great.  Then it's like seven minutes.  The doors go up.  It opens.  And then his friends rushed in because they heard us going at it. 
[02:32:30]  And I got popped.  I got a black eye.  And they ripped my shirt.  Wow.  And he goes, no, no, it's fine.  It's fine.  He actually pulled him off.  Apparently not right away, though.  Not right away.  Yeah.  They got a few in.  They let the shot get in.  And then I remember they all left.  The girls left crying.  I was standing there just for like five seconds.  And I remember Sebastian Maniscalco came out of the, came out of the business center holding  a Frappuccino.  Dainty, like, would it pick you up?  Dainty, like.  Just, it was like the perfect time. 
[02:33:00]  He's like, what the fuck happened to you, guy?  Yeah.  What happened, guy?  What a great story.  But that was my one good one.  But then I got my bad one, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  You should have played Sour Smile over that story.  Yeah, that would have been good.  That would have been great, man.  I don't think, yeah, I don't think I even have a good one.  I was, I got, I got belted a few times, but I don't really have a good, I kicked someone's  ass story.  I got another bad one when I was at the comic strip.  You might remember this.  I sure do.  I'm starting to think you're a problem, Steve.  Yeah, I mean, I gave you the first two, but shit. 
[02:33:30]  15 years of stand-up, I mean, people are drinking, you're going to run into some of those.  But I remember these Jersey mooks, they were, oh, they were saying some Asian stuff  to me, like, you know, Jackie Chan, you can do martial arts.  I'm like, look, it's midnight at the come.  Please just let me get through this.  That is funny stuff.  Let me get through this.  So far, I'm with them.  But I remember they kept going, I kept going, and this girl pipes up, and she starts saying  something.  And I, look, it's a stupid mistake, and I learned my lesson. 
[02:34:00]  I dropped the C-bomb, and next thing I know, one of those heavy metal bar stools came across  and just split the back of my head open, and I got eight staples on the back.  Jesus.  And then you fuckers were calling me the chairman.  Were we?  Yeah.  The chairman, because I got a chair to the back of the head, so it was like, a year I never  lived it down.  We do wordplay stuff at the center.  It's hilarious, you guys.  The worst you guys ever did to, well, I should say Bobby Kelly was the worst.  Bobby Kelly.  Horrible human being. 
[02:34:30]  Horrible.  Would he step on your foot?  No, he, I remember I borrowed his camera.  This is years ago, and I was working with Barry Katz.  He lent me his video camera, and I was going to tape an audition for Saturday Night Live,  and it was all the characters, but I left it running.  I left the tape running the whole time, so I'm talking to myself, doing, it's shitty.  It's horrible.  I'll just say, it was absolutely god-awful looking back.  I didn't know what I was doing.  So I edit it, and I give Bobby the tape back, and I don't know how much his little tapes 
[02:35:00]  are, and I'm like, hey, I bought you a bunch of tapes, and I left the one in so you could  tape over it.  He goes, oh, yeah, thanks.  Thanks, buddy.  He kept the tape.  He edited the worst parts of it together and showed it at Rich Ross's roast.  And I remember, I was at the cellar that night hosting, and I was so pissed I couldn't go  to the roast.  So everybody finishes the roast and comes over to the cellar, and no one's looking at me.  They're not talking to me.  It was like I had a scarlet letter.  It was just absolutely, and I'm like, hey, what's going on?  Why is there going to be weird around me? 
[02:35:30]  And I guess he played that tape, and Colin Quinn is the one that's like, it's too painful.  Please turn this off.  This has got to stop now.  It was, I remember, I don't remember.  Do you remember this, Jimmy?  Yeah, sure.  And it was like, what was the one you did, Wayne Newton?  Did you do Wayne Newton?  Oh, yeah, because he had that awful Bud Light campaign years ago, and that was the thing  I remembered, and I kept saying it over and over again.  But Bobby edited it over and over and over again. 
[02:36:00]  It was just, ugh.  It was agonizing.  That man's a father now.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  There's nothing right in this world.  Daddy Bobby.  The only thing that gave me any redemption is maybe like two months after that, I was  like, I'm not going to be vengeful towards Bobby.  Right.  But I was, this is embarrassing.  I was playing roller hockey, so I was rollerblading back home.  I was with Bobby when that happened.  Yeah.  So I'm rollerblading back home, and I'm on like 7th Avenue or whatever.  9th Avenue.  9th Avenue.  I'm rollerblading up, and I see Bobby and Jim both holding Starbucks coffees, and Bobby's  pinkies out, and I'm rolling. 
[02:36:30]  He's probably pontificating to Jim.  You know something, dude?  You know, we've been giving this life to fucking...  Shut up.  We'll just be nice to each other.  You know, dude, sometimes...  We're doing comedy.  You've got to look at it.  We're doing comedy.  We've been giving this opportunity, and it's a beautiful day.  Oh, God.  But I see them a block away, and I see them laughing at me.  Just laughing.  Dying laughing, like pointing.  Not even saying anything, just laughing. 
[02:37:00]  And I rollerblade up to him, and I just remember I went right between them, and I gave them both  a hand slap, and I saw their coffees flung up in the air.  I didn't even turn around.  I kept skating.  Good for you, Steve.  I heard Bobby laughing, and that made me feel good.  It was one of the finer moments I've seen a person have.  It must have been completely unexpected.  They were like iced cappuccinos.  They were big ones.  Good for you.  Oh, wow.  All rollerblades.  Nice.  Beautiful.  Bravo.  That is so strong.  That's just bullies in 80s movies. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  Yes.  But just doing weird shit to each other, knocking coffees out.  We don't do anything serious.  He wasn't acting when he played the massage therapist for you, by the way.  I can't believe I voluntarily had them touch me.  I know, right?  Be honest, though.  Our touch was nicer than you would have thought.  No, that's not correct, Jimmy.  Actually, the producer, the way that you guys were massaging me, one of the producers  said, it looks like they've never touched a human being.  They weren't.  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, shit.  True, true.  Did you have your top off for that?  Yes.  Yes, you did.  Yes, I did.  Really?  Were you being shy?  And my bottom's off, but that was a choice.  Oh, well, of course.  Were you being shy, or did, uh...  It was the last thing we shot, so not...  I wasn't being that shy.  Did they see your breast scissors?  I don't know.  Did you guys see my tits?  Honestly, no.  We did not.  Do you want to?  Now, did you have an opportunity?  Yeah.  Do you want to?  Yeah.  Do us know a chance, sir.  I'm here.  You're here.  I'm up for it. 
[02:38:30]  That's all it really takes.  Right.  That's how I get people to look at my tits.  I'm here.  You're here.  We're in the same room.  Come on.  I have them.  But I remember at the end of the sketch, there's the hand that comes up, and it's like, and  then Amy goes, how many hands are on me?  Because it was me and Bobby, and then the fifth hand.  But the first time, or a couple times it came up, it basically, over the towel, grabbed  her right on the asshole.  Like, really grabbed my asshole.  Holy shit.  Just a production guy.  Yeah, and she's like, ah, could you...  I love Amy, because she's honest. 
[02:39:00]  Could you not grab my ass like that?  Oh, wow.  Yeah, I was like, can you not, like, put your whole fist in my asshole, please?  Wow.  Wow.  Damn.  It was so, like, yeah, that was a bummer.  A little too much, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just like a, you know, strange.  But he was just...  Already being a good sport.  I mean, Jesus.  He was doing what any guy would have done with that chance.  Well, he shan't be joining anyone for season two.  No.  He was shan't.  Well, I couldn't actually pick him out of a lineup.  And the show's on tonight at 10.  Yes.  And everyone's going to watch the fucking basketball game.  But if you don't, please watch my show. 
[02:39:30]  I don't like basketball at all.  A lot of people don't care about the game.  I don't know.  No, you'll do it.  You're going to do it all right, man.  Yeah.  10.30, Comedy Central.  Yes.  It's good tonight.  It's doing very well.  Very fucking well.  Who's on tonight?  You got anything?  Fuck, who's on tonight?  Yeah.  The opening sketch is, I'm suspecting that my boyfriend's fucking a clown.  And I find footage of him, like, getting out of a clown car with this clown.  Like, I find her clown panties.  I'm like, are you fucking a clown? 
[02:40:00]  It's just, yeah.  And I, God, who do I, I interview a guy who loves Jesus, I think.  Oh.  I really should have Googled the episode.  Hitting the hard topics.  Oh, Lisa Lampanelli's on.  Because I have to roast a Make-A-Wish kid.  Like, I'm his Make-A-Wish.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  That was good.  He wasn't really a Make-A-Wish kid.  Well, I would hope not.  I mean, he is dead, but it was unexpected.  I'm not connected.  Yeah, totally.  Yeah.  Oh, cool.  Did you just go to Australia? 
[02:40:30]  Yeah, I was in Sydney for two weeks.  How was that?  It was good.  I saw James Smith over there.  You guys know James?  I know James.  Yeah, he's a comic.  A seller comic.  He's a Australian guy.  Yeah, but he's just, he's always a flaky guy.  He's good friends with John Mayer, and he just all of a sudden one day was gone.  He got really sick.  What was wrong with him?  He did?  He, like, almost died.  He told me, but I wasn't listening.  Whoa.  Okay.  There could be no more of a serious tale there.  I was like, oh, my God.  I'm like, you almost died.  What happened?  And then I started Googling myself on my phone. 
[02:41:00]  Fucking Amy.  I think tonight is the, um.  Oh, that's great.  I think in the episode tonight, there's a scene, which actually happened.  Like, you know, we're all New Yorkers.  Like, I grew up in New York.  9-11 is heavy on my heart.  Like, anyone else's.  But I was getting, um.  We were getting sandwiches with the writers of my show one day.  And we're looking at how the Freedom Tower is, like, really coming in.  Like, you know, it's almost done.  We're like, they're like, God, it's really coming in.  And everyone kind of starts telling their 9-11 story.  And I was just kind of, like, worried that our sandwiches, like, we weren't going to hear them call our name. 
[02:41:30]  So they're just like, then, you know, I couldn't get through to him.  And I'm like, I feel like we should stand inside, you guys.  So we filmed that scene and I'm just the worst person.  Oh, that's awesome.  But, yeah, but, you know, just because somebody, like, is telling you about a tragedy doesn't mean you're not going to be the piece of shit you are.  That you are normally in life.  Exactly.  It doesn't mean that life stops.  Oh, very good, Jim.  Very good.  Very smart.  Well said.  The guy is so proud of his worthless wisdom. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Life doesn't stop for anyone.  Taps the table.  Oh, yeah.  Words to get by.  Okay.  We need to take a break.  You guys sticking around?  Steve sticking around?  Yeah.  Amy, of course, we'll be sticking around.  Good.  What are we promoting there, Steve?  Steve Byrne.  Sullivan and Son.  It's on TBS.  Of course.  10, 9 Central.  And we live tweet during, yeah, Thursday nights.  We live tweet during the.  Nice.  That is the fun thing, live tweeting during the show.  It's fun, yeah.  It's a very communal thing.  I live tweeted Antique Roadshow last night.  I saw. 
[02:42:30]  I was laughing my ass off.  Oh, that's funny.  You were doing.  Common Central wanted me to tweet my show, live tweet my show, and I act like I misunderstood  that I saw tweeted Antique Roadshow.  I'm like, what a nice cap.  I was hooked.  I was thinking about it.  You're going, man, she's Googling her ass off right now.  No, I was really watching it.  But you seem like an expert.  Like, oh, man, that's really a blah, blah, blah.  I really watched it.  It was funny.  Steve Byrne live on Twitter.  And, of course, Amy is Amy Schumer on Twitter.  And then her show is on Tuesdays at 1030.  Tonight. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, tonight.  Just say tonight, 1030.  Fuck the NBA Finals.  Go online and watch Jimmy.  Go watch the episode with Jimmy and Kenny.  I didn't see the outtakes.  I heard they were very.  Oh, yeah.  We literally laughed through the whole thing.  What, the outtakes were online?  The outtakes were the end of the episode.  Oh, the end of the episode.  Yeah.  I didn't see that.  Where we just keep laughing because.  Yeah, you pop up and you can't stop laughing.  Why?  Just popping up and looking at her.  It was fucking.  Just the two of their heads rising.  Yeah.  That took a while to film.  Yeah, that was a tough one.  That was the last thing we shot, too. 
[02:43:30]  Nice.  Yeah.  But that was.  The outtakes were at the end of every episode.  And so we used that scene because it was just brutal.  It was so hard to get through that.  Just seeing her walk over and start talking and knowing that we had to pop up.  We were going to fucking wreck it.  Yes, you did.  Yeah, the outtakes were really funny.  So we'll come right back.  Yeah.  Sure.  Well, we'll be right back.  This is the Opinion Trish Show.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The Opinion Trish Show. 
[02:44:00]  The Opinion Trish Show. 
[02:44:30]  We're just catching up with Amy Schumer.  It's been a while.  Things have changed around here.  Oh, my God.  And Steve Byrne in the studio as well, of course.  What about Australia?  Did you go there on vacation?  Yeah.  I just went.  I'd never been.  I went and hung out, saw some friends, and I did a little comedy.  Oh, whoa.  A little comedy. 
[02:45:00]  What's your thoughts on Australia?  Is it a cool place?  I loved it.  I only went to Sydney, but I wanted to stay.  Everything was like so good.  Yeah.  Good zoo, you guys.  You guys like animals?  I like yellow.  People friendly, right?  They were cool.  And you know what?  You don't tip over there.  It's not part of the culture.  And that changes everything.  It was so nice because people aren't just helping you at hotels or caps because they're trying  to squeeze an extra dollar or two.  So everybody just does their job.  What happens when someone tries to fucking toss them a buck? 
[02:45:30]  They're like, nah.  They just do.  Take that away from me.  It's more culture, you fucking wanker.  I would think that would mean shitty service, though.  No.  Yeah.  You're like, oh, fuck.  No, they were so...  How weird is that?  They were such a better service.  Nice.  The bartenders, everybody.  They just do a good job.  Sorry, I'm Jim Norton.  I thought I'd tip you.  And now I'm from America.  Jimmy, I need to show you that picture.  Fucking Jim.  Jimmy, Rachel and I were walking yesterday and we saw this woman that looked like Jeffrey  Gary and I had her take a picture with me. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, she's done.  Her hair's a little less irritating.  Amy, do you get nervous when you hand somebody your phone with pictures on it?  You know, I thought about that when I gave it to him, but then I thought, God, that's  so sad.  I don't have anything on there.  You don't have anything on there that could, like...  I don't have one thing on here that could do anything.  It sucks.  Let me count how many pictures...  I'm going to count how many scrolls you'd have to get to. 
[02:46:30]  It's all a terabyte.  I'm going to guess two.  Let me see for my pictures.  How many...  Show us the first one that comes up.  Okay.  The first one that comes up that could be a problem.  The first one that comes up is the chip.  No, the first one that comes up.  That's the chip thing.  The first one that would be a problem if it was in the wrong hands.  The second one is another chip one, because whenever you vine, it saves to your phone.  Right, right.  Yeah.  The third one is a picture of me as Edgar that I sent to my ex-girlfriend, because once  in a while I'll throw one, and it just grosses her out in the middle of a real conversation.  Like, I'll take a picture of Edgar and go, you're up and lower stock.  And she's like, fuck you. 
[02:47:00]  She goes, fuck you.  This next one is a video I sent to Sherrod Small, because we were talking about Richard  Whitmark, and when he slapped Luigi, I'll play it.  It's only about 12 seconds.  It's one of the great slaps of all time.  Oh.  Luigi.  Yes, sir.  Yes, Mr. Yudo.  This is my pal, Mr. Bianco.  He's a big man.  Biggest man in town.  I want to show him what I think of him.  I want you to give him your Diluc short dinner.  But, Mr. Yudo, the kitchen is closed. 
[02:47:30]  There are no credentials.  Holy shit.  That is a great smack.  It's literally...  Holy shit.  There's no pause there.  No.  The slap, if you've ever seen it, is he goes, his hand comes up, and in a fluid motion,  beautifully and sleekly slaps his fat face, and then the guy just holds his face in shame.  Yeah.  So I sent that to Sherrod.  And this other one is the divine video from Anthony's house.  This other one is just me photographing the bad food I'm eating.  Here's another chip video, which I've been buying. 
[02:48:00]  It seems pretty safe.  It's a safe phone.  Here's a nice photo.  You know, Sharon Ozzy sent me a thank you note.  And I read it.  You know, something on the ground.  Thank you.  Are you on my bridge?  This is me and my trainer kind of goofing off.  Those are not detrimental.  That one is...  Is that the one in the spandex?  Was that spandex?  No.  No.  That is another one.  This is a Roland text, which is not dangerous at all.  I Twittered that.  Wow, there's nothing.  There's actually none.  You're pretty safe. 
[02:48:30]  Free phone.  What a model citizen.  Terrible.  That one's bad.  Model of moral integrity over here.  That's just a kibasa and a shoe.  Yeah.  That one's a nipple.  That one's safe.  Yeah, a lot of safe ones.  That one's bad.  Go back.  Go back.  Go back.  Go back.  Go back.  Can I look?  No, it's going to be Jimmy.  Can I just look?  It's so funny.  Guys become like little boys right away.  Let me...  Can I just look?  Let me say.  Come on.  Was she cute?  No.  You wanted to say. 
[02:49:00]  What?  Jesus, Jimmy.  Hey, you wanted to say.  You asked.  You asked me, bird.  I said it like a female thing, but not...  No, it's me.  That's you?  I knew it was going to be him.  Really?  Yes.  I knew it was going to be him.  Why green spandex?  It was a goof, and I photographed him to prove a point, and...  Yeah, I do that, too.  I put on spandex as a goof.  No, no, no.  It's a goof.  Go ahead, goofy.  For a girl.  It was for a girl, obviously, but it was a silly...  It wasn't supposed to be a sexy photo.  It was an obviously...  Trust me.  It was not.  Yeah, yeah.  Mission accomplished. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, there are plenty of hard-on photos on here.  That was not a hard-on photo, so...  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, great.  Good for you.  Whatever.  There's actually much more space than normally there would be.  Like, because I tweet a lot of pictures on Twitter, I'm like constantly, like, instead  of just writing stuff, I'll put a picture up there.  So my photos are full of a shitload of obscure pictures that make sense in the Twitter timeline,  but not on the...  Not telling your phone.  It looks like I'm a complete fucking lunatic.  It's like...  It's like...  Like J. Edgar Hoover, a hot chick, and then a cute kitten. 
[02:50:00]  And repeat.  Right.  Just over and over.  The same kind of...  Someone's ass at an airport.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I needed that.  And there's me and the lads.  You know...  Oh, God.  Back in our days in Liverpool.  Oh, God.  You limey-speaking fuck.  Yeah, I'm a fool.  That's good.  Yeah, I'm a fool.  That's just pictures of my own cock on my phone.  That would be humiliating.  And I didn't even give a fuck, honestly.  Do you take a lot of dick pics?  Why wouldn't I?  Whether they're his or not. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah, I don't have a wife and kids to photograph.  I don't have nice things in my life.  I'd have my own cock or my Aussie pictures.  Yeah, so that's the only one that would be embarrassing.  I don't know.  I obviously read Amy's Twitter and stuff like that.  Occasionally, the dick pics subject comes up.  And I'm not a big fan of the dick pics.  Me?  Yeah.  It doesn't do anything.  It doesn't wake up my vagina.  Right, right, right.  I want that inside that.  Not unsolicited. 
[02:51:00]  Now, solicited dick pics.  If a girl goes like, oh, I want to see that cock of yours.  Is it power play?  Is it future blackmail stuff?  I think so.  I think it's just a power play.  By a woman?  Like, look, he's sending his dick pic.  What an asshole.  Yeah, I do think that.  Wow.  See, women are not as stimulated about what they see.  We're not that visual.  I love a dick.  Yeah.  Like, come on, send him my way.  Save everything else.  No flowers.  Right, right.  Just dicks.  But to see one never does it for me. 
[02:51:30]  And that's how most girls I know are.  It's what they hear.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You've got to describe it to them.  In a voicemail, I guess.  Yeah.  I like hearing about it.  In a voicemail.  I like hearing about it.  I'll say it to you.  In a telegram.  But yeah, to see a dick pic.  But I like, I'm being more careful now, but it's fun for a girl to send pictures, you  know?  Yeah, now you're in a position, though, you've got to kind of be a little more careful, right? 
[02:52:00]  There's no way that something's not going to get out there.  Oh, Amy.  Do you have your face in them?  No, I don't have your face in them, rookie.  No, I know.  No, my face isn't in them.  But I feel like you guys probably know what my pussy looks like.  Just from being here so much, you can guess, you know?  Let's guess.  I say we can.  Okay, let's look at three pictures and you guys have to identify.  That would be a really good game.  That would be a good guy.  Yeah, I'll describe it pussy.  That would be a wonderful game.  It looks like Holyfield's here after Tyson's.  I've seen it. 
[02:52:30]  It's really big.  There's a glove hanging out of it.  It's like that glove from Dress to Kill when the guy's waving it from the taxi.  Oh, God.  It looks like a Bloomin' Onion.  It's just...  I want someone at Outback.  I imagine you're very busy these days and stuff, so you probably don't have as much time  to keep it as kempt as you'd like, so probably a little five o'clock shadow every so often.  What does a tell say?  It looks like it's been upsolving a crime all night.  Is that a tell?  Is that the answer?  No, but a pussy?  Oh, yeah.  That's funny.  That's a great line.  I think that's a tell, yeah. 
[02:53:00]  That's a great line.  No, things are good right now.  Oh, good.  Yeah, because I'm...  But like when we were filming the show, like, you know, I would kind of catch a glimpse  and I'd be like, oh, so I guess somebody wants to look like their mom in the 60s.  Like, things get out of hand.  It got away from you?  Oh, yeah.  It got so away from me.  Just like, oh, nobody was handling the lawn during winter.  Yeah.  I was just busy.  It's like, yeah, you have to do so much.  I have to go see a stranger, you know? 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  I have to go see, like, a Russian woman.  Is that it?  Yeah, yeah.  Waxing and stuff?  Yeah, and it's like, just like a woman's, like, you know, like...  They're right there.  They're right there.  Yeah, and the last time I got it done, like, I hadn't had sex in so long that just, like,  nobody had touched me.  So as soon as she touched me, I, like, got super wet.  Wow!  And then I'm like, does this chick think that I want to, like, fuck her?  Like, I was like, no, no, no.  It's just my body's reacting because I...  Can you tell the story again, but I'm going to lie down and point my toes? 
[02:54:00]  It was so fucking embarrassing.  You see her dipping her fist in wax?  She's a 60-year-old Russian woman.  Oh, man.  Wow.  I think she's just used to that, though.  Yeah, she's got it.  I'm sure she is.  I mean, you know, the first lesbian to show up in her fucking...  You know, the first girl with mommy issues.  I show up already hairless, wearing a garter.  I don't know what work you can do now.  A schoolgirl skirt and a fucking lollipop. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, my God.  Super wet.  Wow.  That's...  Yeah.  It was sad.  I was like, oh, I'm lonely, and I haven't been touched in a long time.  Sorry, miss.  Anyone.  Wow.  Anyone touching you then would have...  Yeah, it had been a while.  It had been...  Like, tipped it off.  I mean, you know, and I'm wired to want to do that, so it had been a good three months.  Yeah, I pity you.  I mean, there's turbulence on a plane.  I'm ready to go.  Yeah.  I know.  You're like, my jaw was wired shut.  I'm like, no one touch my pussy. 
[02:55:00]  I mean, the violin starts playing.  So, there were two holes that were wired shut.  All right.  I need to have that wired shut.  I can't believe I'm alive.  Especially, again, because of cabbies.  That's true.  That's one of the greatest stories.  If they didn't want to finger you, why do they have a front seat?  Oh, right.  Those fucking dirty cabbie hands.  He wasn't purelling.  Believe me, he was handling cash.  What an amazing story.  Coughing into his hands.  Isn't that the kind of dirt in his hands where you could see the dirt?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  It looked like he had just been fixing a bicycle. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, that's terrible.  I bet it's the same cab driver, and he's just, like, mad.  That probably is.  He's just trying to disinfect his hand.  That is a great story.  Yeah, you don't hear ones like that much.  No, not often.  Fucking Amy rules.  Yeah.  I'm not a fan of those shoes, by the way.  Oh, God.  When I put them on this morning, I was like, oh, here we go.  Where were the shoes? 
[02:56:00]  Were you in the fucking wardrobe department for on Golden Pond?  Those are terrible.  They are, really.  Those are Henry Fonda shoes.  Terrible.  So, did you see Chelsea Peretti?  We tweeted a picture of our shoes to you.  I think I did, yeah, because her fucking footwear would enrage me.  Really?  We both have the worst.  Terrible?  Yeah, those are terrible.  Those are the fucking slippers Lamada wore when he was walking down to beat Joe Pesci in Raging Bull.  Remember the slippers he put on?  Jimmy really noticed his offensive footwear.  Oh, those are fucking hard.  That was the worst.  When I would be on the road opening for Jimmy, I wouldn't be paying attention, and then I would 
[02:56:30]  just start getting tweets, and it would be that he tweeted my shoes, and people  are just like, ew, kill yourself.  I mean, it is.  No!  Come on!  Let me just, it's just your foot.  Oh, you're done.  They're pretty bad.  They are pretty bad.  They're like what George Burns would check his mail in.  Just slip a man and go out.  Yeah, yeah.  That is a little too perfect.  Wave to the bus of tourists that have a map of his house. 
[02:57:00]  He'd ashen him.  Oh, that was fucking upset.  I'm actually cutting everything down just to the shoe.  I don't want the legs.  Some guys like real, and girls are flattered, but when guys notice their footwear.  Oh, not me.  Oh, that's a nice shoe.  To me, it seems like, to me it seems like an obvious come on.  Like, he's doing that on purpose.  He doesn't care about your fucking shoes.  That, like, notices that I have sick heels on.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, whoa, are those the new Pradas?  Yeah!  Do you like dick? 
[02:57:30]  Like, get out of here.  Some girls are like, oh, that's so hot when a guy notices it.  I don't know his shoes, really.  And I'm like, I have no fucking clothes.  I assume that men are, like, just...  More feet in general, I don't know.  There's guys that, you know, that's their thing.  I don't get it.  I don't get that one.  It's just tits and ass, and then that's it.  Tits and ass.  Meat and potatoes.  Yeah, yeah.  You'll stand by.  By the way, you always take pictures of, like, embarrassing...  The minute you took a picture of her shoes, I remember I was at the cellar one time,  and I was eating with chopsticks. 
[02:58:00]  I was enjoying my meal so much, I waited all day for some Korean barbecue,  and I just see the flash in my face, like...  And he just ran away smiling, laughing.  Oh, no!  Why would you do that in front of these guys, ever?  I don't think so.  I mean, you're just there every night.  You don't think, you know?  You just don't think.  Are you serious?  You have to be on your guard.  They're just waiting.  Yeah.  Artie Foucault was drinking a grape soda the other day.  My camera was right in his redness.  You guys are the worst.  The fucking worst. 
[02:58:30]  Just lying in wait.  Yeah, you can't do anything.  Just waiting.  I don't even remember the chopstick photo.  Fuck.  I'm sure I still have it.  I never throw stuff out like that.  Yeah.  I'm so happy I got that.  That's a keeper.  That's a keeper.  That's a keeper.  Yeah, you know, get out of the gym.  Eat, eat, I like it.  It's eating better.  Eating, eating better.  Thank you.  How are you?  See, that's one of our interns.  That's one of our interns, Amy.  That's Sydney.  She runs out of here.  Thank you.  Oh, look at her.  You're running out. 
[02:59:00]  Sweetheart.  You know Amy?  I don't know.  Thank you.  How come you've been rude to Amy?  That's Amy.  You don't like her?  What's wrong?  What's wrong with her?  What's up?  Oh, look how much she doesn't want to be in here.  No, I only feel protective of you.  I want to give you my number and also a rape whistle.  I appreciate it.  I appreciate it.  Oh, she's already had a story.  Really?  What happened?  Tell Amy.  I had a guy follow me from Penn Station to here.  Oh, well, Roland works here.  He was probably sitting here anyway.  He followed you like he knew who you were and he followed you?  I don't know.  He just walked and tried to be real creepy. 
[02:59:30]  He was a black guy, so he was pulling all that like, oh, hey, man.  Of course.  Yeah, you probably did know that.  He's like a video game tester and all this.  I was like, yeah.  Video game tester.  Oh, my God.  No.  That means he's always on the clock.  He just stole a fucking Xbox is what that means.  Oh, God.  So, how's the experience working here so far?  It's been a lot of fun.  Really?  What's been the worst moment?  Like, with one of these guys?  Thanks, Amy.  I mean, you're hilarious.  I don't.  Nothing yet. 
[03:00:00]  Okay.  But she's fully expecting, of course.  So, it's not.  We're not that far in yet.  Three weeks and it's already like, you know.  It's pretty good.  First of all, it's the first time I've ever known interns' names.  I honestly, and, you know, that could be a joke.  Yeah, you mentioned her by name.  Not even a joke.  It's like, I don't know any of the guy interns that have been in and out of here for years.  Right.  But it's like, oh, it's Jackie and Sydney.  Here they are.  That's so funny.  The wonderful interns.  We were talking, and I remember she said, she said, I think I got this job, because  under hobbies on the resume, I put first base is anal. 
[03:00:30]  Wow.  Whoa.  So, I think that helps.  That might have gone a long way.  Why did you want to intern here?  Well, I worked at a radio station back in Florida, so I figured this would just be like  one step up.  It'd be more fun.  Oh, okay.  It'd be a way to spend the summer in the city.  And it is, right?  It is.  Wait, you're not from here either?  I'm from Florida.  She's from Florida?  Oh, I didn't know that.  And now he just forgot it.  No.  We've had this conversation like four times now.  Oh!  Mommy and Daddy are fighting. 
[03:01:00]  See that?  Not today, guys.  The married guy had no clue.  I remember sitting there going, Florida, you idiot!  Of course it!  I know Jackie's from Rochester.  Oh, yeah.  Where is Jackie?  Where is Jackie today?  She's got Jackie in here to meet Amy, too.  She can't bring facts about the girl who's not in here.  I know, right?  And then there is a third intern, but we don't know his name.  I'm serious.  We don't know his name.  I saw him.  He was in here earlier.  Another thing that happened, one of the creepy guys that I invited to my party asked for her  phone number at the poker table.  Yeah.  Did you get it?  That's not bad to ask for a number.  But she gave the number. 
[03:01:30]  I didn't think about it.  I felt bad.  I know.  I've learned.  I've learned.  Yeah.  Jackie!  Aw, and look at Jackie.  See, I know you're from Rochester.  See?  That's great.  Just because Rochester's the best.  That's right.  Oh, no.  She's sassy.  She's sassy.  The handle on the hip.  That's your attitude.  She is sassy.  Yes, for an Irish spring commercial.  I feel like you guys are tough and you can handle it here.  Exactly.  Yeah.  And the team dynamic works for them, too.  Yes.  There does need to be two of them.  They strategize. 
[03:02:00]  Oh, yeah.  We've already figured that one.  If they go to the bathroom together, they cover each other's drinks.  Yes, yes.  Because when I invited them to a party at my house.  First time interns were invited to a party.  Yes, of course.  You show up, it's just him in a bottle of Jack.  Exactly.  Wearing a robe.  Yeah.  You were reassured it was not going to be.  Ladies.  Anthony's wearing slippers and adult diapers.  So I was like, I'll send a car out there so they don't have to drive and everything. 
[03:02:30]  They met at one of their houses out there on Long Island.  But they had this strategizing little meeting going on like, all right, look, we're not going  to separate when we get there.  Like, there's a whole thing like they were going to fucking to prison.  They were.  And they were.  Amy.  Look who's outside the studio.  That's the other intern.  That's the other intern.  I think she's the cutest.  He's never invited in. 
[03:03:00]  He's a beautiful boy.  Yeah, he looks like a young George Washington.  He's never invited in.  George Washington.  He's old.  He sounds like rich.  Is he rich?  I don't know.  We don't know anything about him.  We don't know anything about him.  I swear I don't know his name.  I feel like he doesn't speak English.  Like, he's so funny.  He's an old school intern.  He really is.  That's how we get here.  I kind of want to have sex with your interns.  Do you?  Yeah.  Welcome to the club.  I mean, I'm sorry.  We did hear your story.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:03:30]  I don't know why.  I just, I love that dynamic.  They both have boyfriends, apparently, that let them just come to New York City.  For the summer.  For the summer, to intern on a radio show.  Have they heard the show?  Do your boyfriends?  Yeah.  Are they listeners?  Yeah.  Oh, they listen every day.  Oh, yeah.  They're listening every day now.  That's for sure.  I see that, though.  And then, another thing I noticed, all of a sudden, they started getting a lot of Twitter  followers, because she started mentioning it. 
[03:04:00]  The second they started getting Twitter followers, Sydney changed her profile picture to her  and her boyfriend.  What's really funny is that's not even my boyfriend.  Who is it?  That's just by one of my friends from school.  Oh, because I was like, oh my gosh, she wants guys to know.  But I changed it to one that didn't have my face on it.  That's what I changed it to.  It's like, half or something.  Yeah, but you're in a bikini.  That's true.  Yeah.  She has like a chicken face on.  Bless you.  Thank you.  It's not hell because you're in a bikini.  That's true.  I should probably change it.  What's your Twitter?  No, no, you can leave it.  What's your... 
[03:04:30]  It's all right.  Seth Rogen.  What?  What's your Twitter handle?  Seth Rogen picked that.  Sydney with two D's.  Like S-Y-D-D-N-E-Y.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah.  Sydney, New York.  Obviously not true.  Sydney, New York.  Yeah.  Here's a goof.  You want to bring in the third guy?  S-Y-D-D-N-E-Y-N.  For what?  Really?  True.  Oh, by the way, ladies.  July 6th is a big 4th of July party over the house.  If you're, you know, available.  I'll be in Amish country.  Oh, you're both going to Amish country? 
[03:05:00]  I'll be camping by Amish country.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  You're teaming up again.  Yeah, we'll have a party before that.  You've got to watch the Amish.  Well, I think on the 4th of July also.  Thursday.  That Thursday, there's probably something going on.  Yeah, whatever.  You sent them a car?  Well, I didn't want them driving.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's not that you're being sweet.  You don't want to be, like, liable.  I don't want to be held liable for any problems that may have happened.  Although, with the fucking cab drivers you two have. 
[03:05:30]  I know.  You'll get fingered and punched in the face.  What do you mean?  Our driver, his license expired.  Yeah, yeah.  Three months ago.  It doesn't mean he forgets how to drive.  You know, it just means he probably had some issues.  Couldn't quite, you know.  Very aggressive.  This is so funny that you're making him stand outside.  Like, he's a stepchild.  He's Margot Tenenbaum.  You know what it is?  He's every intern we've ever had.  So, who cares?  Yeah.  Who cares?  He looks by far the cleanest cut.  No, he's got kind of greasy. 
[03:06:00]  His hair's a little greasy.  Dad issues and black lipstick and angry goth.  Goth.  Some goth fucking guys.  With a chain.  Yeah, yeah.  I cut just to feel something.  We get it.  All right.  By the way, on Father's Day, did you notice that, like, more tweets than any other day?  Like, everybody had so much.  Mother's Day, like, came and went.  Nobody even.  Yeah, you know what?  You're right.  Just 80.  Dad.  And I hate people that posted the earnest.  Like, here's my dad.  Like, a great man. 
[03:06:30]  Yes.  I don't even want you on my phone anymore.  You're right.  You're right.  Thanks for leaving, Dad, and never coming back.  There was this, here's the man I aspire to be half the man of.  It's like all this mushy, like, shut up.  Exactly.  And it's fucking Bill Hitler.  Bill Hitler.  Do you guys have good relationships with your dads?  I do.  Yeah.  You can feel it.  You can feel it.  Oh, hell yeah.  It's the only reason you can work here, I think. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You should have to meet people's fathers for them to work here.  Oh, God.  Oh, I love a good destroyed relationship with a father.  Wow.  Oh, man.  I could sniff it out.  Hold on a minute, please, if you don't mind.  We got a phone call coming in.  A very important phone call.  All right.  Who's this?  Hey, it's your other intern.  Do you guys know my name?  He really is calling.  I swear I don't know his name.  Oh, Tyler.  Yeah, there it is.  It's because I'm from Tyler Chicken from Seinfeld episode. 
[03:07:30]  I'll take whatever I can get at this point.  We can see you when you're calling us.  You're calling for like a prison visit.  Yeah, exactly.  I want you to jerk off on the window like Midnight Express.  He's pretty.  He looks like Amelie.  Amy wants to go for Midnight Express.  Yes.  Amy wants to know if you're rich.  I'm not.  No.  No.  Me personally, no.  I wish.  Your parents are well-to-one.  Let me guess.  Your mother is a maid, and your father is Arnold Schwarzenegger. 
[03:08:00]  That's what it looks like to me.  He does.  Yes.  Surprisingly accurate.  Yeah.  I know it.  I know it.  Yeah.  Are your parents rich?  No, not really.  No, they are.  You can see it.  I'm a white and middle class.  Like, that's rich in one way.  What's your ethnic background, sir?  I'm Italian.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Good talking to you.  This is that.  Oh, damn.  Such support for the staff.  Good talking to you.  Do you want to call him back and invite him to the July 4th?  No, I don't think I'll be inviting him to the July 4th. 
[03:08:30]  You have to.  We have to have him.  He'll be driving the car.  Yeah.  Can you drive the ladies?  Yeah.  How much longer is in your internship?  Two months?  Nice.  They've already answered this until August.  Yeah, yeah.  They've just begun.  Just making sure.  I had Irak.  Oh, thank you, Irak.  Irak pulled the curtain on the other intern.  Now we can't see him.  Now we can't even see him.  Any thoughts on maybe applying for a job here at SiriusXM Satellite Radio after your internship? 
[03:09:00]  I would end school a year and a half early.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  This job is a good gateway to get you on Cowhead in Tampa.  Gateway to Cowhead?  God damn.  I was thinking like Wisconsin or something.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  Are they working out like work-wise well?  Do they do a good job there?  Sam's laughing.  Sam?  Because they're actually being taught something. 
[03:09:30]  Uh, yeah.  Because like Sal and Irak are actually sitting down with them and teaching them things.  Oh, there's nothing worse than...  Now that never happened with other interns.  No, and the boy intern doesn't know how to do anything.  Oh.  They just want to help your career.  Because they're not...  They won't sit down with them.  Sal.  Ladies, let me show you how this is done in radio.  And they give you a lot of hands-on time, right?  Sal was sitting with Jackie teaching her Pro Tools for some reason today.  No intern ever learns Pro Tools.  No reason for it.  And he was, uh, explaining to me that, uh, he feels like these two interns have really 
[03:10:00]  boosted morale.  I feel like they have.  They have boosted morale.  I'll give you that.  Can't argue that point.  I know how to run the board in there.  Like, I do the doubles and start the show and all that.  Sal?  Sal?  Probably because we've interned in different places.  You think that's what it is?  Well, we know what to do, yeah.  They have good work ethic.  They say like, you know, can we help out?  I'd like to learn this.  And, you know, we want to help them.  Wow.  This, uh, this isn't for my personal collection.  I just want to get, uh, a pick. 
[03:10:30]  Sal, you like girls yet?  Or where are we at with the girls thing?  You're still not sure?  No.  I like girls.  We're not sure about Sal.  No, I'm not, Amy.  I'm not.  You've never even considered a pick?  Tell Amy, tell Amy the other story.  The other story?  All right.  Well, I had...  Tell her, tell her the big story that we've explored.  I had a little bit of sexual trouble coming with a, uh, girl.  A few times.  With a really hot girl.  Yeah, she was not a pig.  Although I have to side with Sal.  A lot of times that happens if the girl's not sexy.  Just because she's pretty.  She's really sexy.  She was.  She was stunning. 
[03:11:00]  Were you nervous?  Did you get stage fright?  I think, I think I was a little nervous because I knew no matter what I did, it was going  to come up here.  Why?  Did you?  Oh, she works here.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  And, uh, so I had, it was, it was probably about four or five times and just, uh, four or five  times.  Yeah.  So now, naturally, I'm, I'm, I'm gay because of that.  Well, that's funny because that's a conversation you have in the mirror.  When Sal greeted me, he said, uh, he's the one that said first base is anal, too.  You know what, though? 
[03:11:30]  I don't even, I have to side with Sal a little bit.  I mean, I do think he might be gay, but the fact that, uh, I like him anyway, but I think  that, uh, that doesn't, that, because you couldn't come with that girl, maybe she wasn't  turning you on.  She obviously was not turning you on right.  I don't care how pretty she is.  She was doing something.  She probably had a dumb look on her face or something.  No, he was nervous.  He was picturing your faces talking about this.  You were picturing this moment.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  That's not why you can't come, though.  I can come.  That's the only girl I've ever had that trouble with.  Oh, stop it.  Yeah, well.  But he's like, what? 
[03:12:00]  I think you're lying.  Was it all in one night, or?  No, it was like, it was like four or five separate times.  Ah, Jesus.  Yeah, everyone just turned away from him.  That was bad.  I had a lot of anxiety.  The chair slowly turned on the floor.  Yes.  Just sick leper on the, sick leper on the village.  All right.  We'll give you one, maybe two, but five times.  Five.  You know what would be a good tip for you in a situation like that, if it happens again?  Just, like, picture a guy.  And then you'll shoot.  He'll shoot.  He'll shoot right away.  Look her in the eye, but just think of having your face fucked by a gentleman.  Picture two not-white hands on the back of your head. 
[03:12:30]  Teaching you a life lesson.  Picture a cock doing it in your mouth with a fist into his jaw.  Holy shit.  Sal never gets out of here unscathed, that's for sure.  No, that story always comes up.  Yeah, so at least it comes.  Game back to the girls.  Yes.  They do have a good work ethic, and they work hard.  They're always asking, you know, hey, I'd like to learn this.  Well, you wanted to know. 
[03:13:00]  You wanted to know why I sit with them when I actually show them stuff.  Oh, stop.  We know why you sit with them.  I hear it's like camp.  I hear it's like camp in that fucking office.  It's fucking ridiculous.  Yeah, a lot of giggling, a lot of games.  No, are you going to tell the story of Frank?  The most telling where you put the apple under your chin and got a truth.  It's like, it's all part of learning radio.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sam, what's going on?  You guys have seen interns come and go for how many years?  Oh, God.  I don't even want to fucking give the answer.  They just said it's awesome in the office. 
[03:13:30]  Right.  How many interns have ever come in here and described it as awesome?  Are they hanging in the office?  I'm saying it's awesome.  All your interns always look like just a little sad.  Like there's just a glaze.  Especially you can see that they thought this would be a fun job.  Yes!  And that's what annoys you guys the most.  Guys that thought they were going to have fun here.  Thought they were going to have fun.  And then, you know, these two bright lights of sun, rays of sunshine come in.  And we're just like, you know, this is great. 
[03:14:00]  Morale in the office is high.  I've never seen it like this.  It's a little weird.  It's great.  Once they leave, it's going to be like the fucking opening of Private Ryan.  It's just not going to be good around here.  No, this is setting a precedent.  It is.  Only girl interns.  Only spooky, cute girl interns.  It's all we want in here.  Enough of these dumb guys.  We got this waiting for us.  What the fuck?  Now we got to sit in here and go over console stuff?  Is that what it is? 
[03:14:30]  Yes.  They're waiting.  Wow, that's a great fucking juxtaposition, isn't it?  Who are those guys?  Are they reshooting happiness?  That is exactly what he looks like.  Sir, could you come on the wall for us?  Just come on a postcard and stick it to something.  I guess they want to go over a few console issues in here.  I guess this has to be done. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah.  We're signed.  We lose some.  Damn it.  Next time.  It don't matter.  We have to give the proper plugs.  Yes, we do.  Yes, we do.  Absolutely.  We'll start with Steve here.  Sullivan & Sons is on Thursday nights.  It's 10 o'clock on TBS.  Season 2 is already happening.  And it's at Steve Byrne.  It's B-Y-R-N-E live on Twitter.  And of course, Amy, her show is tonight.  10.30.  Yes, it's 10.30.  It's coming central.  After Tosh.  And it is every Tuesday night for a new episode. 
[03:15:30]  And we're doing a second anti-social show.  The first one's sold out.  Bethlehem.  Bethlehem.  Neither of us know how to spell.  No, we're both spelling it wrong.  Oh.  Where Christ was born.  That's where we're building.  Yeah.  It's Amy, myself, Artie, and David Tell.  First show sold.  We have a billboard outside the Lincoln Tunnel.  I just heard.  Wow.  I haven't seen that.  Really?  Yeah, Kenny told me.  That's very cool.  I'm very happy about that.  July 20th.  Tickets are on sale this Friday morning.  Cool.  Nice.  Yeah, Adam.  Yeah.  Come hang out with us.  That was fun.  We got to do podcast intros, too. 
[03:16:00]  Oh, fun.  New podcast will be up tomorrow.  What are we going with?  Liberace's ex-lover there.  Eight-track porn.  And eight-track porn.  And Opie and Anthony Nugget.  Kenny told my man.  I went to see Gene Wilder speak,  and Kenny had my manager convinced I was taking Scott Thorson.  So I fucking...  Jonathan's so dumb.  I talked to him and he goes,  Jim, are you really bringing Scott Thorson to see Gene Wilder?  And I'm like, what's wrong with you?  And I'm like, oh, fucking Kenny. 
[03:16:30]  He goes, he said you're bringing Scott Thorson.  Yeah, that's who I'm bringing.  This is a world traveler who can't really afford to be gullible  in these countries that cut your heads off.  Yeah, he's fucking amazing.  And he believed that?  That's probably why he doesn't get killed,  because he's not cynical.  He's just too stupid to be killed?  He was really good.  Sam and I went, and we read about it,  but I didn't...  He was good.  He was interesting, and he's an older guy.  Uh-oh.  Does he still have it?  He's kind of...  You're being nice.  He said he hated the remake of Willy Wonka, right?  Yes, he did.  He said he thought it was insulting, 
[03:17:00]  and he was right.  It was.  He doesn't like Tim Burton.  But no, no, he was really actually good.  Sounds like sour grapes to me.  Yeah, well, that's what I said to him.  He's right, though.  That guy, that...  Willy Wonka was so good,  and then the remake of...  I don't like the remake.  He's a shitty city.  I don't like it at all.  Sam, what did you think of Gene Wilder?  What was wrong?  He's a little slow now.  Yeah, I mean, yeah.  He's definitely slower.  He's 80.  And he's not...  He's turned 80.  He's not Mr. Charismatic.  Like, he's not Willy Wonka.  He's Gene Wilder.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  So you thought it was going to be Willy Wonka.  Yeah, he likes to stay at home.  He likes to write his books.  He's a lovely man. 
[03:17:30]  He likes to enjoy drinking tea with his wife.  Who would go to this thing?  And giving his wife a kiss.  This is terrible.  This sounds like a bore.  All while in Amy's shoes.  You're the callback king.  You're the callback king, man.  What color are those?  They're yellow.  Oh, fucking...  Someone on Twitter said it looked like you put on a banana peel.  That really made me laugh.  Those shoes are fucking awful.  I wish Keith was here.  I've never said that before.  Oh, my God.  Yeah. 
[03:18:00]  In front of Keith.  God damn stupid shoes.  They said they were like gators.  Fucking stupid.  Yeah, it was pretty fucking bad.  No, what was that Woody Allen movie where Gene Wilder falls in love with the sheep?  Oh, I think you always wanted to know about sex, but were afraid to ask.  Yeah.  Oh, that was so good.  That was so funny.  Yeah.  His part.  That was, you know, years ago.  Apparently now he just chats about fucking...  Yeah.  I hate that though.  You think...  When someone's so funny, you think like, oh, they're really smart and they know what they're  doing.  Oh, no.  But it sounds like he was just kind of like, you know... 
[03:18:30]  No, he was bright, but he said that the first question the guy asked him was, what's  the biggest misconception about you?  And Gene said that I'm a funny guy all the time.  Oh, no.  He's like, I'm funny in movies and I can be funny there, but I'm quiet.  Like, he was really...  He's very aware of the fact that he's the mayor of...  And you look at your watch.  55 minutes left.  Right.  Dutchville.  Sounds like a snooze fest.  Yeah.  The mayor of Snooze City is here.  I like to drink tea.  Oh, God.  Oh, fucking bully.  That sounds terrible.  Why didn't we just get the picture and fucking amscray? 
[03:19:00]  All right.  Jimmy came around.  Jimmy came around.  Shit.  He came around.  He's being polite.  That was a legend.  Yes.  You know, he was...  It's interesting.  You told that story 10 minutes ago.  He finally came around.  Holy fuck.  He did...  I sort of wonder if Jimmy was...  Not feeling well.  He did stories.  He did stories and the interviewer tried to, like, say, oh, from before when you were telling 
[03:19:30]  us, and Gene Wilder was like, oh, yeah, that's what I was talking about when...  And then he did the whole story again with the same...  Get the fuck out of here.  I did enjoy him, though.  I actually thought he was a very lovely man.  I really mean that.  He was a very nice man.  Oh, my God.  I fucking get this man away.  Did you talk to him?  Yeah, beforehand, because they know me from the Y, so I walked in, and they escorted  young Samuel, my date for the evening, back to the press area.  It was just me, Sam, and a few people, and then some press.  They know you from the Y?  Well, I did a...  The 90 Seconds Street Y.  I did a thing there for Colin.  Oh, yeah, that didn't sound right. 
[03:20:00]  I spend most of my time with the young men's.  Yes, I teach the dance that they do at Yankee Stadium.  No, I did something with...  Woody Goldberg and Judy Gold for...  It was a Carlin tribute.  Yeah.  Oh, and Sherrod and I went to see Sidney Poitier there recently.  Sidney Poitier.  Poitier.  Yeah.  And we wanted to go backstage and meet him, so Sherrod said, let's just walk back.  He goes, I'm black.  They won't stop me.  They'll think I'm related to him.  That's so smart.  And it fucking worked.  I'm sure.  I just followed fucking Sherrod back.  Yeah.  It was great. 
[03:20:30]  When you met Gene, was he...  Well, you followed him in because they thought he was Gene Wilder.  Gene Wilder.  Sam's hair.  Could have done that.  Did you talk to him at all?  Was he...  No, I just said, I think you're brilliant.  Because I really...  I think in movies, he's brilliant.  And we took a picture and that was it.  Did you talk like him?  Yeah.  It's a pleasure to meet you.  Did you get one out of my time?  I've wanted to know you for so many years.  No.  That was just...  You know what it is?  Before we go, that was a wispy...  You know, my voice, I just got weak.  Like when Ozzy talked to me. 
[03:21:00]  That's what...  I wasn't expecting him to write.  No, it was...  It was...  But it wasn't intended to be British.  It was old-worldy.  You are...  I don't know what it was.  Maybe.  I just panicked.  None of the gem?  Eating better.  I just...  Yeah.  Eating a little better.  Ah, you know, after the potato farming.  We had to eat whatever we can find.  If they said, we'll take you home with us and you can live in the room that Jack grew up in,  you would absolutely do it.  Oh my God.  He'd give up everything.  Not only would I do it, but I would suggest that.  When they leave, I would go like, hey, how about I come back with you?  Oh God. 
[03:21:30]  I love him more than I've ever loved anyone.  Yes.  It's sweet.  Now we're holding Amy, I'm being told.  So we gotta get Amy out of here.  Oh, Amy.  She's doing all sorts of interviews for Inside Amy Schumer.  Yes.  Tonight, 10.30 on Comedy Central.  Are we still your favorite, though?  Yeah.  Of course.  Yay.  I love you guys more than anybody.  Yay.  And a great first appearance by Steve Byrne.  Come back and see us, Steve.  All right?  That was fun.  Yes.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  All right.  The Opie and Anthony Show is pretty much true.  This show will be available later today with Sirius XM On Demand. 
[03:22:00]  After ONA Live is next.  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Whoa.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  I don't know if it sounds any...  It's a party in here. 
[03:22:30]  They have no idea.  Yeah, it is.  It's the summer camp office.  Come to life here on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Thank you for bearing with us for the worst of bits and the production we were playing.  Your headphones are loud, Eric.  Thank you.  It's bad for your hearing, you know, to keep your headphones this loud.  There's meetings going on in the big studio where we usually do the show from, where we  do all the shows from here on the Opie and Anthony channel.  But I guess they're having meetings right now to figure out how they're going to modify 
[03:23:00]  the console because after all the complaining that Opie and Anthony have done, management's  pretending that something is actually going to change.  So they're trying to figure out how to edit the studio and where they can cut down the  console and where he can remove some of the buttons that are in front of Opie and I don't  know.  There's a lot of people in there with coffee cups in their hands and arms folded and things  that, yeah, a lot of hot air, a lot of clipboards, you know, a lot of things that you can put 
[03:23:30]  in your hands to seem busy.  I don't think either of them, any of them in there have picked up on the fact that we've  decided to broadcast live from the phone screening studio because I decided to, you know,  change or turn off all the monitors in the studio before we started.  But this room, how big would you say this room is, Eric?  Maybe 10 feet long, maybe 6 feet wide.  So we're talking, this is about 10 foot by 6 foot and I didn't realize, I came in to 
[03:24:00]  say, well, let's just start the show from the other room because otherwise people are  just going to think it's worse stuff.  Granted, people thinking it's worse of Opie and Anthony, I'd probably get more listeners,  but I just didn't want to, you know, I didn't want the perception to not be what was actually  going on.  So I walked into this 10 foot by 6 foot room and the entire summer camp office has decided,  is this what goes on while the show is happening?  Are this many people in here?  No, they're usually in your studio.  I guess so.  But so, uh, E-Rock is obviously in here. 
[03:24:30]  Roland is in here taking up, taking up a lot of space.  He's slouched over.  Remember, uh, you heard the precious little giggles of Jackie and Sidney, of course.  Uh, I guess, and of course, if there's most of the guys who work for the Opie and Anthony  show in one room, you can probably guess that Jackie and Sidney are in that room.  Probably why they're there.  Sal's in here.  Troy is in here.  And the other guy is in here.  Troy, what's that guy's name?  Taylor! 
[03:25:00]  Taylor, Taylor, Taylor's in here.  He's the boy intern.  Sal, uh, I want you to take note of something.  Every time you go into that studio and I bring up, you know, your, your sexual inadequacies  that you brought up before, you act like, oh, Sam, you bring this up every time.  I didn't say a word this time.  I didn't say you did.  I said they would bring it up every time.  No, no, no.  You've yelled at me in the past and said, you always bring that up.  It's over.  We've gone over this. 
[03:25:30]  And I didn't say a word this time.  I wasn't even near a microphone.  I wasn't calling you out this time.  It's just that I knew it would come up regardless.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It had to.  The what master?  Quay master.  Okay.  Sure.  You understand.  You were in there today and you're talking about the work ethic on these female interns  and saying that the reason that you're sitting with Jackie and teaching her pro tools,  which you've never taught an intern pro tools.  Never.  Never.  Is because she has a strong work ethic. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah.  That's it.  And your example was, she's always asking, oh, can I do something else?  Can I do something else?  Troy, Sal, every intern we've ever had has asked, what can I do?  Yeah.  But a lot of times they don't follow through.  Like the last intern, that other jerk off, he would sit in the studio and he would be  on his phone the whole time while I was trying to show him pro tools.  Yeah.  But you know why they don't follow through?  Because they don't have one of the staffers sitting almost on top of them, showing them  button by button exactly what to do. 
[03:26:30]  That's not me.  I don't do that.  I know you don't, Troy.  I'm not accusing you.  What I am saying is, you remember all the times that we would have lousy interns and I  would every time question, and you know I would, I would question, is this a lousy intern or  do we not have great teachers for these interns?  Did I not question that every time?  Right.  Absolutely.  And I'm going to sit here and tell you that I've seen these interns be taught and they're  being taught differently from any other intern we've ever had.  It's also, it's just, they're easier to work with. 
[03:27:00]  How so?  Even, even Tommy, the other intern is fine.  He is?  Yeah, he's fine.  He's good, too.  He sits and does his work and comes and asks questions, you know?  Tommy, have you learned anything new since being here?  I know what Audition is now.  He kind of knows what Audition is.  He knows what it is.  He doesn't even know how to use it.  He just knows that it's a program, Adobe Audition is a program that is used.  I'm doing a show, buddy.  I'm doing it.  What are you doing?  I'm doing a radio show.  Are we on the air with you?  No.  Now you are.  Now you are.  You weren't before. 
[03:27:30]  Is Sam doing his after show?  You're in a closet.  He's in a fucking closet.  Hey, hey, before you make fun of this closet, why don't we show them what a party this closet  is?  Woo!  Oh, God.  How many people are there?  Summer camp has moved into this production studio.  Holy shit.  Yeah, well, what am I going to do?  Sit there and wait for you guys to talk about stuff that's never going to get down in that  studio?  You should have cracked the mics on and heard the fucking crap that goes on in this.  You guys know that console is never going to change. 
[03:28:00]  Uh, no.  You think that was a waste of meeting?  You're total wasting your guys' time.  You should have gotten home.  I got tricked.  I got tricked this time.  I got tricked, too.  It's not going to happen.  I got tricked.  I really thought we were getting things done.  No.  I thought this was going to be getting cut down.  Right.  I got tricked.  More room.  So, with the podcast intros this week, are you going to now just do them live on the  show?  Do you want me to turn that room off so you can do them by yourself?  Let's just do it live right now.  Okay.  This is for our podcast that will be available tomorrow.  Okay.  Every Wednesday, the Opie and Anthony podcast. 
[03:28:30]  If you subscribe, you'll hear this.  Yes.  As we say it tomorrow.  So, the first thing you need to do is, like, as the intro of the podcast, and then the  first bit would be Scott Thorson.  We don't have to intro the podcast.  No.  We just acknowledge that people are listening to it.  No.  They're there.  They know.  You guys are the professionals.  No.  I mean, put this on the podcast.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do this part.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, God, we don't need to intro the podcast.  And that's kind of the intro for the podcast.  Right.  See how that works?  This is the intro for the podcast.  Isn't that perfect?  And then we move on to Scott Thorson, who is in here. 
[03:29:00]  Right.  And I guess he used to have sex with Liberace.  Yes.  He was Liberace's lover for many years.  He had plastic surgery that looked like Liberace.  It's a pretty twisted story.  He said he knew him for 17 years, which, by the way, is mathematically impossible.  And that leads me to believe that a lot of the things you're about to hear are just  lies.  Yes.  Please stay tuned and listen for all the bullshit that pours out of Scott Thorson's face.  I hate having these realizations after the fact. 
[03:29:30]  Ex post facto.  Yeah.  But now it's fun, because now we throw it on the podcast, and now you get to listen to  Scott Thorson and his lies.  And you know in hindsight that he's lying.  He's full of shite.  He's a big, fat liar.  Yes.  I don't know.  I would say 50% of what you're about to hear is true, and the rest is lies.  That's this horse shit.  Last week, you gave him 80%, by the way.  Now you're down to 50.  It'll be 30 soon.  Because I'm being nice.  I don't know.  You figure out what is real and what is a big, fat lie. 
[03:30:00]  All right.  Now you've got to...  Yeah.  We're really good at doing intros.  Oh, that's perfect.  It's amazing.  Still the intro.  Yeah.  What?  Now you've got to intro 8-track porn.  Oh.  How long ago did we do this?  I would say five, six years ago.  Wow.  Yeah.  8-track porn.  I guess before the porn of today, people got off listening to 8-track porn.  The ease of use of pornography today on the intratubes makes it very easy.  Back in what we call the day, there was no videos. 
[03:30:30]  There was a...  You might have seen an occasional stag film.  Sure.  But the truth of the matter is, people used 8-track tapes and listened to their porn on that.  You think, right as the woman is having an orgasm, you had that fucking click to the  next track?  You had to change?  Like when Sweet Home Alabama would be halfway through and the volume would go down?  Freebird.  That was...  Yeah.  It was Freebird, right?  Freebird. 
[03:31:00]  Freebird was a classic where it was on two tracks and the first track would...  Wow, we're really dating ourselves.  How about we shut up and they listen to 8-track porn?  They don't need to know how old we are right now.  We said we didn't want the intros being really long and really describing because we probably  talk about this in the fucking segment.  But we're doing the intros live, so now we feel like we have to perform for everybody.  We really do.  We would never sound like this if we were just recording it not live on the air.  Sam, why don't you tell them how it usually is?  Yeah, these intros...  We bitch and complain and go, yeah, yeah, this is good enough. 
[03:31:30]  That's good enough.  That ought to hold the little fuckers for a while.  We got to get back live on the air.  But we're performing.  We're idiots.  I know.  We suck.  Why?  Usually you record the intros right after the show, which means that they last 45 seconds  because you want to go home.  But now we're back on the air.  Well, we were bamboozled into the console meeting.  Oh, God.  And now we would have had these done already.  Like we did for Joe Piscopo.  You're going to edit this all up all nice, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're going to cut it up?  Yeah, we'll cut it down.  We'll cut it down.  You're going to cut this down all nice for the people? 
[03:32:00]  Yeah.  All right.  8-track porn.  All right.  Kenny's freaking out because he's down on the street with my car.  Yeah, I'm going to.  Evading the police.  Let's go.  All right.  Is that it?  We don't intro the nugget.  No, the European Anthony nugget is coming up.  Yeah, the nugget just drops in all by itself.  It'll be at the end of this fine podcast.  Yeah, don't worry.  You'll get your fucking nugget.  It'll drop out of your asshole when you least expect it.  All right.  We'll see you in what will feel like five minutes for tomorrow's show.  No kidding.  No, you're not actually saying goodbye now. 
[03:32:30]  What?  Oh, no.  That was goodbye for our input on the show.  Right.  Oh.  The Sam Roberts debacle continues.  It's already happening.  It's already happening.  From the closet.  This is it.  But we broke in, like, a special report.  Well, can't I go back into the main studio now that you guys are reading?  I wouldn't if I was you.  How would you do that, by the way?  There's a nice vibe in there.  It's going to be dead air.  Yeah, I can't count on any of these guys to take the mic for 30 seconds.  Are they still in there?  Yeah.  Why don't you make some noise, everybody?  Yeah.  Oh.  A little more lackluster than it was, right? 
[03:33:00]  Oh, who's this?  Oh.  Yeah.  Hello?  Who's on the phone?  Who's it?  We're partying.  Who's it?  Who's he talking to?  Ant's on the phone.  Oh, hi.  How are you?  Who's that?  Very good.  Who is that?  Who is it?  Yes, I have a bum tooth on the back of my head here.  It's the dentist. 
[03:33:30]  Hi.  I do a radio show.  I'm on the air right now, but you're not, so it's okay.  Is he the one you said was a faggot?  No, no.  Yeah.  Is that the dentist you said is gay?  No, I think it's a nice young lady.  Oh.  A lesbian.  Does she lick box?  Does that dentist lick box?  Can I get in touch with you later?  Do you think that maybe...  Do you also want to fill her cavity?  Ant's got his little boy voice on.  Dude, is she a goer? 
[03:34:00]  Is she a goer?  They are going to fuck up his mouth.  Well, yeah.  It feels like, you know, it's very sharp on my tongue and my cheek.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You know it.  They can't hear me in there.  I mean, the phone can't hear me.  So I can't yell along with...  Could I call you back in an hour?  I'm in another room.  Who the fuck is on the phone?  Thank you so much.  Bye.  Bye. 
[03:34:30]  I always try to talk a little louder when the cursing goes on.  It's like, yeah, thank you, Barry.  Bye.  Oh, you've never sounded better.  I think in the afternoon here, I have an apartment.  I think I found one.  Hey.  She could grind down this thing.  It's so bad right now that when I was trying to do a wonderful read for one of our wonderful sponsors,  I was sounding like this.  It's starting to talk.  I'm sounding like this.  You're cutting the shit out of your mouth.  Yeah, it hurts.  Thomas Tooth.  Yes.  It's the exact thing that happened to me. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah.  And it's double-edged, so it gets my tongue and the cheek.  Tongue and cheek.  Oh, but not funny.  Not funny.  Fucking hilarious.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are we doing here still?  I have no idea.  Like, it's almost the afternoon now at this point.  What?  I mean, you would have been asleep by now.  I would have been, well, very close to just being in bed.  If you weren't listening to a bunch of guys with no intention of doing anything helpful  lie to you about consoles.  Just fucking lie through their teeth about our concept. 
[03:35:30]  No, I have faith in them.  What's that sign on the door say?  Leave hope here.  Forget hope.  No hope.  Hope is dead.  Yeah, all that.  It's all the same.  All that.  Hopi?  You're staying?  No, I'm getting the fuck out of here.  Ant's walking out.  All right, have fun, everybody.  We're all having fun.  I'm done skating.  Ant's leaving.  I'm still in the closet, though.  They have left me in quite a pickle.  Because I guess when they were recording those intros, I probably should have just walked 
[03:36:00]  into the studio.  But I decided not to.  You want to go now?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I want to go now.  Want me to play some walkover music?  Can you talk a little bit or something?  Give people some entertainment?  We can.  Let's, let's, as a matter of, you know what?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I've got a terrific idea.  I'm going to run away.  Let's see.  Jackie and Sydney, why don't you do the Jackie and Sydney show for the next 25 seconds?  Are you ready?  Come on up to the microphone, ladies.  I'd like to treat you all as part of After Open Anthony Live. 
[03:36:30]  You got to hear the podcast intros.  Now, you're going to get to hear the debut of the Jackie and Sydney show.  Take it away, girls.  I'm going to get over on the other side.  There you go.  All right, all right, all right.  We got it.  All right.  Go for it.  So we just talked to Amy Schumer.  She's got an awesome picture.  Even funnier in person.  I can't wait to see her show.  I know.  It's been a great season for her.  When does Anthony's show come on?  I don't know.  When does Anthony come on?  It's like his episode.  Next week.  Next week.  So that'll be funny to watch. 
[03:37:00]  10.30 on Comedy Central.  Oh, beautiful.  We'll be watching that.  Record it.  DVR.  You got to keep talking.  Sam's beautiful hair.  Jackie and Sydney, everybody.  Jackie and Sydney.  Oh, there we go.  How'd the show go?  Headphones.  How did the show?  They're not wearing headphones.  Jackie and Sydney.  Sal, you were listening.  How'd their big show go?  They just were asking a lot of questions to each other and not answering it.  Oh, it's like David and Bobo.  Yeah.  Kind of like that.  Oh, we should have talked about Bobo.  You don't have to.  Your show's over.  It's all done.  But I think you guys did great. 
[03:37:30]  Eric, you're a radio, you're a seasoned veteran at this game.  How did the girls do?  They had theme music and everything.  They were ready to go.  What is their theme music?

[03:39:00]  Call up if you want.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  We're really about to take this to the next level.  Happy to be here with after Opie and Anthony Live.  I was excited.  Yesterday, somebody tweeted me, and I retweeted it, if you go check, another picture of Dwayne  Wade in even worse capris.  Did you see what I tweeted last night?  I saw that tweet, yeah.  Now, we were talking about this NBA fashion thing yesterday.  Now, he's wearing white capris with like a navy blazer. 
[03:39:30]  It's the most insane thing that I've ever seen.  Yeah, it's literally, it's not even a blazer, it's a pea coat.  It's an identical outfit to whoever that woman is.  There's a woman who's wearing the exact same outfit that Dwayne Wade is wearing.  Those are women's clothes.  And he has a more feminine bag than she does.  Yeah, and a more feminine walk, it would appear in that photo.  He would fuck you up, though.  But Dwayne Wade would rip your head off.  Look, he's a giant of a man.  He's a hell of an athlete.  But he's wearing women's clothes in that photo. 
[03:40:00]  He looks like an asshole.  Now, if I saw him, I'd probably be like, yeah, but you make it look cool, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  You'd be talking to him like, hey, man, I like this new style you're putting together here.  Yeah.  With your fucking...  I would probably show up that day wearing capris.  Yeah.  And be like, okay.  That photo there, obviously the whole thing is very feminine.  But what do you think is the most feminine part of that entire outfit?  Of Dwayne Wade's outfit.  Yeah, because the first thing I noticed, I want to see if it's the same thing you do.  Okay.  Well, I'm going to say...  Let me look. 
[03:40:30]  Let me give it a good look.  It's on...  Not Sam on Twitter.  I tweeted it like a couple days ago.  It's not the shirt.  I don't know.  I mean, the trim on the jacket is fairly feminine.  Yeah, it's a very slim cut.  Is that what it is?  No, but that's not it, though.  Yeah, the trim is very feminine.  I'd say the shoes are quite feminine.  That's it.  Is that it?  That's the first thing I saw on there was the shoes compared to the side-by-side photo.  Yeah.  If you just cut it off at the pants, you can't tell if it's a guy or a girl.  Yeah, absolutely.  Absolutely not. 
[03:41:00]  And if you cut it...  Actually, you can tell.  If you cut it off at the pants, you can tell that's a girl.  That's definitely...  Like, if you saw that photo, you'd be like, oh, yeah.  At that angle, you can tell that's a guy wearing the same clothes.  That's a woman's legs.  Look at D. Wade.  Sal, you're a basketball fan.  Yeah.  Just look at the legs.  Yeah.  Would you guess man or woman?  That's woman.  That's woman.  Yeah.  That's woman.  You know, it's funny.  Woman!  When I was in middle school, the black kids used to make fun of me because I used to  have tight pants then, too. 
[03:41:30]  In middle school, it wasn't cool then.  What's up?  Was it cool then when you were...  No, no, no.  I was just like, nerdy shit.  His middle school's different than yours.  Interesting.  Yeah, I guess so.  And they used to say, Sal's got high waters.  Yeah.  That's what they used to say to me all the time.  You know what they used to say?  High waters was a thing, but you know what we used to say in middle school?  If you walked up with some tight pants on, we'd be like, ah, look at Sal.  He's got hepatite ass.  We'd kill you, too.  Yeah.  We'd kill you.  I was always friendly with the black kids.  No, none of you had hepatite ass, you weren't.  Yeah.  Matt in Connecticut. 
[03:42:00]  Hey, guys.  Hey, Sam.  I saw that tweet where they had the side-by-side shot with the black girl with Dwayne Wade.  I thought for sure it was Photoshopped.  There's no way.  I mean, it was exactly the same outfit.  To the shoe, it was stupid.  Yeah.  There's no way it's real, and I guess it is.  It is real.  I mean, look, you can tell it's in a locker room.  I mean, it's just awful.  It's insane.  It's insane.  Let me go to John in Mississippi.  What's up, John? 
[03:42:30]  Welcome to After Open Anthony Live.  The great primetime Sam Roberts, the greatest broadcaster on satellite radio.  That's right.  I had a question for you.  Maybe it's me, but any time Amy Schumer comes in, doesn't Anthony sound like he's a little  bit smitten over her?  Yeah, but I think every time, when Amy Schumer comes in, I think everybody except Jim is somewhat  smitten over her.  I would say everybody on this show, most of the staff, I think everybody here is somewhat 
[03:43:00]  smitten.  I mean, even, Sidney, you were a little smitten over Amy Schumer.  I mean, she's cute.  She's cute, as she said.  Everybody's a little smitten with Amy Schumer.  That's her quality.  That she walks into a room and people can't help but be smitten.  And then she says the most horrific, revolting sentences ever known to man.  It's perfect.  Craig in Texas.  Hey, guys.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, I missed part of the show this morning, so somebody may have already called in about  this, but Scott Thorsten yesterday was on the Stern Show. 
[03:43:30]  So, listen to that in the afternoons, because, you know, I get tired of listening to y'all  all day long.  I mean, you can't, you don't have to, yeah, you don't have to listen to the same show all  day.  You're allowed to spend your afternoons doing what you see fit.  Anyway, yesterday, he's on the Stern Show, and, you know, last week, he told y'all that  he had sex with Michael Jackson.  Yeah, I mean, that was part of the interview.  Scott Thorsten, Liberace's boyfriend, he'll be on the podcast tomorrow if you missed it, 
[03:44:00]  but he said that he had sex with Michael Jackson.  He said that Michael Jackson was a top, but had a small penis.  Well, yesterday on Stern, he said he never had anal with Michael Jackson.  And they only blew each other.  Yeah, that's the thing.  Like, I know that Opie and Anthony and Jim were pretty convinced that most of what he  was saying was true, but I was quite sure myself that this is a guy that will say anything  to make some money. 
[03:44:30]  Now, I can't sit here and say that this man is a liar, but, I mean, I would have a hard  time believing everything he says.  He's like a fictional speaker, you know?  Yeah, go ahead, Craig.  Last week, when you, I do remember you saying you thought he was kind of full of shit.  Yeah, he is.  That's right there.  I think he's a guy who's full of shit, because he makes his whole living not doing anything  except talking about other celebrities.  Like, he's like Ian Halperin, if you remember his highness, his Hollywood highness Ian Halperin. 
[03:45:00]  Like, he just spends all his time saying things about famous people.  So, if you run out of things to say, your income source gets shut down.  So, of course, you've got to be full of shit.  Yeah.  Well, last week, I thought he was full of shit, and yesterday, he proved it.  Yeah.  You know, he told y'all he only gave it to the Liberace one time in the ass, and yesterday,  he was telling Stern, oh, every time I gave it to him in the ass, I made him douche before  he, before we did it.  You know, he's just full of shit.  Already saying the facts on him. 
[03:45:30]  All right, thanks, Craig.  Yeah, I mean, my suspicions are confirmed.  However, you can't tell me that it is not fucking hilarious to watch some guy who's an adult  man just sit there and lie about, if he's lying, to just sit there and lie horribly about celebrities  is hilarious in and of itself.  Absolutely.  So, you have every reason to want to listen to this thing.  Another article here for you, Sam, is, this is Amon Shumpert.  He's a guard for the New York Knicks. 
[03:46:00]  He's about my age, so he's like, you know, 22-ish.  He's 22.  He is wearing, his hair and clothes were only in style in 93.  Right, he's an extra pretty much in Do the Right Thing.  Yeah, exactly.  A dashiki pattern, and his high top is even higher now.  But yeah, he's wearing a dashiki pattern, dress shirt, orange khakis, you know, rounded  nerd glasses, and just awful.  Well, we went over it yesterday.  I mean, when you got money, you can pull off pretty much anything. 
[03:46:30]  Did you hear, Eric, I don't know if you heard this, but it immediately reminded me of an  episode of The Simpsons, which is why I thought of you.  Did you hear what's going on with Putin over in Russia stealing the Super Bowl ring?  The ring, yeah.  The funniest story I've ever heard in my life.  So apparently, Robert Kraft has his, I guess, Patriots Super Bowl ring, and he's in Russia  for whatever reason.  And Vladimir Putin asks, can I look at the Super Bowl ring? 
[03:47:00]  And the guy goes, yes, of course you can look at the Super Bowl ring.  You're Vladimir Putin, after all.  And the story that Robert Kraft is telling now, which Putin is denying, but, you know,  why wouldn't you believe Robert Kraft?  Robert Kraft is telling this story where he takes off the ring, he gives it to Putin.  Putin makes a comment on the ring, like, you know, being really nice, and then puts the  ring in his pocket, and then, like, four KGB guys roll up surrounding Putin, and they  just walk away, and the ring is just gone. 
[03:47:30]  And immediately, it reminded me of The Simpsons' trillion-dollar bill episode.  That's exactly what I was thinking of.  Can I just see that for a second?  Sure.  Where is it?  What bill?  Oh.  Yeah.  Where they have a trillion-dollar bill, and they give it to Fidel Castro, and they go,  now give it back, and Fidel Castro just goes, give what back?  And it's gone.  They lost their trillion dollars.  Can you imagine the feeling of helplessness that you would have if you handed something  like a Super Bowl ring to Vladimir Putin, and you just know it's gone? 
[03:48:00]  Like, he puts it in his pocket and walks away, and you're like, oh, my God.  I can't fight the president.  I can't.  This is the leader of the country.  Yeah, and then they all leave the country, and then within a week or so, you know, Putin's  out there, he's doing press for something, or giving a speech, and he's moving his hands,  and he's wearing the ring.  He's wearing the ring, like, bitch, what are you going to do?  And then he comes out and says, well, it was a gift, so don't even worry about it.  Robert Kraft gave it to me as a gift.  No, I found this somewhere.  Yeah, no, no, no.  This isn't his.  I found this.  It was in the rug. 
[03:48:30]  If he left it behind, he left it behind, but this one was mine.  Oh, did Robert Kraft, did he lose his Super Bowl ring?  Oh, no, no, no.  I've always had this one.  This one's been mine since the beginning.  They melt down the engraving on the inside of the ring.  And then I was reading that he was told when he got back stateside not to make an issue  out of it.  And he was like, what the motherfucker?  He took my ring.  What do you mean don't make an issue out of it?  That's a Super Bowl ring he stole.  It'll be a new Cold War because of a fucking Super Bowl ring.  Well, as far as I can see, that's not the United States of America's fault for saying 
[03:49:00]  give us back our thing.  That's Russia's fault for being like, boxed.  Give me old shit.  Yeah, run your pockets.  How great would that be where you read about World War I and it started over the assassination  of Archduke Ferdinand.  World War III started over when Putin stole a Super Bowl ring.  Yeah.  And then he started, like you said, he goes on television and starts doing his speeches  wearing this ring.  That's a slap in the face.  That's a slap in the face while wearing a Super Bowl ring. 
[03:49:30]  And that shit hurts.  That hurts way worse.  So funny.  Have you ever had anything stolen from yourself?  No.  Just like in broad daylight like that.  It's such a horrible feeling.  I remember when I first, and it's not a Super Bowl ring, but that feeling is there.  When I first kind of got the picture that when somebody asks you for money and says they'll  pay you back, that they lie.  Especially, you know, I went to an elementary school. 
[03:50:00]  It was in the lower income section of town.  It was a diverse school.  And everybody was all about the pretzel rods because they were 10 cents each.  A lot of niggsters there.  I don't know what the fuck that is, Sal, but I don't want that word on my show.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I dumped out, Sam.  Thank you.  No, you didn't.  He didn't.  He always says that.  It's his little joke.  But I don't want that word on my show.  And I thought I made that clear yesterday.  It's going to catch on.  And by the way, yesterday Troy was going, yeah, everybody's going to be dropping M-bombs.  The more I thought about that, the more I thought it was completely ridiculous because 
[03:50:30]  he sees kids doing it.  All those kids that are dropping M-bombs right now, they're not going to do that when they're  adults.  Yeah, you never know.  Yeah, sometimes you do.  Sometimes you do.  You were saying some dumb shit when you were a kid.  Now you're an adult.  You're not going to say it as much anymore.  Yeah, I suppose so.  But I realized it's the same feeling of just helplessness.  Like you've just been completely demasculated, emasculated even.  Yeah.  When this kid came up to me, Daryl, and he goes, was he from East New Rock City or West 
[03:51:00]  New Rock City?  He wasn't from the Jewish end.  Okay.  We'll just put it that way.  And he goes, yo, Sam, let me get a quarter.  And I go, oh, I don't know.  I only have one quarter.  And he goes, I'll pay you back.  He's like, okay, deal.  I will let you have this quarter, Daryl.  But you have promised to pay me back right then.  And I'll never forget.  It was like a couple weeks later.  I had not heard one word from Daryl. 
[03:51:30]  And he came up to me again.  And he goes, yo, Sam, let me get a quarter.  And I go, no, Daryl.  I'm not going to let you have a quarter.  Because last time I loaned you one, you never paid me back.  And he looked at me right in the face, eye to eye.  And he goes, man, I paid you back.  And at that moment, I said, this is inarguable.  He's just lying to my face.  I had no idea that this was happening.  Because before that, before third grade, I was in England. 
[03:52:00]  And everybody's all nice to each other in England.  You know?  Everybody's all proper and well-to-do.  And everybody's doing just fine.  Nobody's taking your quarters.  But I'll never forget when Daryl looked at me and said, man, I paid you back.  And I was like, this is not.  What am I going to say?  No, you didn't?  He just, he's lying to me.  There's no defending that.  Yeah, that's a very Daryl-type person answer.  I don't know what the fuck that means.  No, you never met Daryl.  So you wouldn't know what he's like.  I saw what they used to do a lot on the train. 
[03:52:30]  There was a train stop by my high school.  I'd take the train home.  And if you were in the last car, in the back, there was a staircase that went up to the street.  So a lot of, you know, Daryls would do.  I don't know what that means.  I'm sorry.  Do you mean passengers?  Yes.  No, passengers who were just at the train stop, not actually taking the train.  They weren't going to get on the train.  They weren't getting on the train.  Okay.  So what they would do to these kids is they, like, they would go to Lurie, the last door  on the train.  They would say, hey, what time is it?  Right?  And what, you know, at the time, a lot of people had iPods.  So what kids would do is they would take out their iPod and they would just fucking yank 
[03:53:00]  the iPod right out of them.  And they'd run straight up the stairs as the doors were closing.  And you see this happening?  I saw it probably like three times.  And so you'd know.  Like, if somebody ever came up to you and said what time it is, you'd be like, fuck  yourself.  I have no fucking clue what time it is.  Yeah.  It could be a hundred o'clock.  I have no fucking idea.  And I got to, there's nothing more humiliating than watching someone's like big headphones  or iPod right off their fucking head.  Because their earbuds are in their ear.  It's such like just a feeling of just being pussified.  Yeah. 
[03:53:30]  And, and, you know, you're watching and you're like, I can't tell the police about this.  Nope.  Nope.  There is, I'll never see that person again.  There's nothing I can do.  Yeah.  And I knew looking at Daryl, Sal, who Daryl?  Daryl.  Okay.  When I looked at Daryl, I immediately realized, if I go and tell a teacher about this, Daryl's  not going to have a problem lying to that teacher, too.  No, no problem punching your fucking face.  Right.  He'll tell that teacher, I gave Sam his quarterback.  Yep.  And I'll be blamed for lying.  And then I'll have my teeth knocked down my throat. 
[03:54:00]  I'm helpless in this situation.  And that's exactly, on a different level, how Robert Kraft must have felt.  When Putin's like, when he sees the KGB just lining up against Putin.  And he realized, that decision that he made to say, yes, you may look at my Super Bowl  ring, when he slid that ring off his finger and he placed it in Putin's hand, placing  it in Putin's hand, that is something that just clicked in.  KGB rolls up and he goes, that was a terrible decision I made.  I can't believe I just did that. 
[03:54:30]  My Super Bowl ring is gone.  There's nothing I can do about it.  And it's not even going to stay in America.  It's going to stay in fucking Russia.  He's doing speeches with the thing on his finger.  He has nothing to do with the National Football League.  Okay?  Russia is not represented in the National Football League.  You know why?  Because it's a national football league.  Not international.  That's true.  You know what nation they're referring to?  America.  United States.  America is right.  America.  America.  And now he's got to sit there and watch this guy rocking that ring, just blinged out 
[03:55:00]  to the tee.  And I've got to sit there and look at Daryl, flipping quarters down the hall.  Look at me.  The quarter king of Trinity Elementary School.  I wouldn't fuck with Putin.  Have you ever seen him?  He goes hunting and he's jacked.  Let me put it this way.  I would fuck with Daryl before I fuck with Putin.  Okay?  I would not fuck with him either.  And I've told you, I've seen all the hostile movies.  I've seen all the Taken movies.  The Eastern Europeans are the last people I would ever fuck with. 
[03:55:30]  Look at this guy.  He's like a horseback hunter.  He's a politician.  And you can find photos of him shirtless in a lake with a gun.  He's killing polar bears.  And that's just Google image search.  All you have to do is search Putin.  There you go.  And you find pictures of him killing Bengali tigers.  You know what would happen if Obama was next to a dead Bengali tiger?  PETA would be like, what the fuck?  If PETA said what the fuck to Putin, they'd be the dead bodies next to him.  Then he'd be crouched next to him. 
[03:56:00]  Absolutely.  He's a badass.  My God.  Well, he's got a Super Bowl ring.  Yeah, now he's got a ring.  He's got a ring.  Listen, thank you for bearing with me today.
