<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a post-2004 Presidential election recap, mocking various news networks’ coverage – Dan Rather’s monotone delivery on CBS, Fox News’ premature victory calls, and NBC’s extravagant set design.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony,  ridiculed celebrities who supported John Kerry, including Michael Moore and Howard Stern, for their perceived lack of influence and low voter turnout,  revealing they themselves didn't vote.  They spent considerable time derisively commenting on a John Edwards audio clip, targeting his and his wife's appearance.

The discussion then veered towards their soundboard's "gay" section, featuring homophobic slurs and an inappropriate *Friends* clip. They also commented on Marion Barry’s re-election and a sexually suggestive description of a photo of Governor Pataki voting. A "Whippin' Out Wednesday" segment was mentioned, leading to a discussion about bodily functions and underwear preferences. A prank phone call with a woman who thought she was speaking to Tony Danza was played.  The show also included plans for a "Stoner Spelling Bee" and promised more sexually suggestive content.  Profane and offensive language was frequent.

A listener, Debra, called in. The hosts engaged in sexually suggestive banter with her, culminating in a crude joke before abruptly ending the call.  Opie’s disliked Spider-Man Halloween costume was mentioned, along with Debra’s appreciation for the show’s “realness” and dislike of the “silly stuff.”  Debra’s unusual request for a photo with Anthony involving a “mule” was also noted. The hosts then discussed their media coverage, including descriptions of the show as "frat boyish" and "pumpkin-headed."  They also touched on the freedoms of satellite radio compared to traditional broadcasting, particularly regarding offensive language,  before launching into a series of increasingly offensive analogies comparing their show to historical atrocities like the Holocaust and the Yates family murders.  A conversation about political correctness and the use of racial slurs followed, including Opie recounting a physical altercation after using the N-word.  The "Stoner Spelling Bee" and a search for a female caller for more "sex" were again mentioned.  The segment was filled with crude humor and offensive language.

The post-election discussion continued, speculating on Bush's win and criticizing news networks' extended coverage. A call with Ozzy Osbourne followed, revealing his confusion about the election and his dislike for his wife, Sharon.  Jimmy Norton’s fart was a notable interruption. Ozzy's too-violent-to-air domestic violence PSA was also discussed.  The “Stoner Spelling Bee” then commenced, featuring intoxicated callers attempting to spell words, interspersed with anecdotes about marijuana use.  A call with frequent caller Marion, focusing on her job as a poll worker, weight loss, and upcoming show appearance, involved playful teasing and insults.  The “Stoner Spelling Bee” resumed, followed by a "Guess What's in My Pants" segment with Dawn, describing her pubic hair texture.

The "Guess What's in My Pants" game continued, with guesses including "Mohawk," "Wood Floor" (the correct answer), and "Well-Groomed Triangle." The "Stoner Spelling Bee" resumed, with callers attempting to spell words like "campaign," "auxiliary," "provisional," and "gubernatorial," along with humorous anecdotes. Steve won the bee.  The segment included Jim Norton stories (man exposing himself at Bob Kelly's house, slamming dressing room doors on guests at "Tough Crowd"), a discussion about the "Jackson Whites," ironic public service announcements, and details about pornography websites sent by a listener (interracial sex with racial slurs, spankings, and crack whores).  A discussion about a man trying to take over Governor's Island and clips from *Reservoir Dogs* concluded this segment.

A call with Old Dirty (O.D.) recounted his homelessness following a fight with his twin brother, including sleeping in his sister's truck and claiming a Coney Island bench. He later revealed he'd become a "Dominican millionaire" via a lawsuit.  He discussed the election, conspiracies, and the electoral college, using profanity and street slang. His past phone card controversy with the show was also mentioned. A caller then discussed a bizarre Wall Street job interview and unusual barbering experiences.  The Governor's Island takeover attempt was revisited, ending with discussion of missing audio clips and a promotional announcement. Tim Russett was mentioned as being present in the studio.

[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you. 
[00:05:00]  There's a price to be paid in terms of the cultural degradation that we do not want  to be associated with anymore.  Are you adequately prepared to rock, rock, rock?  Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits. 
[00:05:30]  It's over, Johnny.  It's over, Johnny.  I'm big, dick, black. 
[00:06:00]  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  It's over, Johnny.  It's over, Johnny.  It's over.  Nothing is over.  Nothing.  You just don't turn it off.  You're fired.  All right, this is the O.B. 
[00:06:30]  All right, this is the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Good morning, everybody.  This is the O.B. and Anthony Show.  This is the O.B. and Anthony Show.  What's surely?  Spreading across America to all the fine red states.  The red states or the blue states?  Well, I think the blue states already like the O.A. virus.  Right.  We're trying to turn the red states around.  Oh.  Making them understand this radio program.  Making them understand our sense of humor.  Holy, yes.  There's two different countries. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, absolutely.  Oh, my Lord.  We live in a land divided between red and blue.  And there's a lot more red on that map than blue this morning.  We told you guys yesterday, 24 hours ago, right now, that President Bush would be continuing  in the White House.  Of course.  But a lot of the news stations, O.B., won't commit just yet.  They still think Ohio is going to make the decision for the country. 
[00:07:30]  But it's over.  Bush won this thing.  Yeah, Bush is going to be our president or continue to be our president.  I got to tell you, last night I started watching the coverage.  And as soon as they said that the polls have been closed in Ohio for an hour, but there's  still a three-hour wait to get their votes in, people still waiting online, I said, good  night.  Good night.  Just walk away.  I wanted to stay up to see if Kerry could pull this thing out. 
[00:08:00]  But as soon as they said that, I'm like, I'm going to bed.  Nothing is going to be decided tonight.  No, absolutely not.  And why is Ohio deciding this election?  We've been to Ohio.  No offense to our fine listeners up there in Cleveland, but Ohio's a scary, scary state.  Yeah, well, it all hinged on Ohio.  And if you watch CBS News with Dan Rather, it's still hinging on Ohio.  He's not committing.  And a lot of people, they call it the swing state.  Dan Rather, better than taking a sleeping pill. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, my God.  Dan Rather.  I was trolling through all the news stations last night.  And CBS with Dan Rather.  My God.  That's the one I put on when I just wanted to fall asleep immediately.  Put him on.  He just, his monotone delivery on everything can lull you into sleepy land.  Into a coma.  Just into an absolute coma.  I liked one thing on CBS.  I liked the touchscreen guy. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, touchscreen guy was scary.  Touchscreen guy.  The guy from the Minority Report, man.  Yeah, it looked like Tom Cruise in Minority Report.  He had this huge screen.  And it was touchscreen.  So he would touch something, and this other screen would pop up, and he's clicking and  dragging with just his fingers.  Yeah.  He wasn't using a mouse or anything.  He's touching something on the screen, and then he'd drag it over with his finger and  hit it, and it would expand on the screen.  I was like, wow.  He was like a conductor in front of that screen.  That's high tech, yeah.  Let's look at the red stage. 
[00:09:30]  That was the only cool thing CBS had.  And the win for last night's, not the election, but the news coverage, has to go, in my opinion,  anyway, to NBC.  NBC with Tom Brokaw.  Were they the ones with the ice rink?  They had the ice rink down there.  I like the ice rink.  Democracy Plaza.  Democracy Plaza.  The whole ice rink was the United States of America with a lot of red states and blue  states.  8,000 American flags flapping in the breeze.  They had the ice rink with the map underneath the ice.  Right.  And electronically, the states would turn red or blue underneath the ice. 
[00:10:00]  They wanted to declare Bush the winner because they thought Ohio was a blue state, but it  turned out it was someone with frostbite.  They were on the ice too long, and they were turning blue, and they had to sweep him off  Ohio and realize that state was still up for grabs.  Still up for grabs.  That state hasn't been decided.  Get those Smith children off the ice.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, they had the ice.  The ice rink was a little hokey last night.  But not to just be a one-trick pony, and I was laughing at this. 
[00:10:30]  They actually had two scaffolds, two like window washer scaffolds that were on the side  of 30 Rockefeller Center.  One labeled Bush, one labeled Kerry.  One trailing blue streamer, one trailing red streamer.  They both started on the ground.  As the candidates would get their electoral votes, the scaffolding would be pulled up the  side of the building, and the streamer stretched out.  So you had this big red streamer going beneath the Bush scaffolding, and this little one beneath 
[00:11:00]  the Kerry one, the blue one.  And they raced up the side of 30 Rock, Opie, as the election went on.  I thought that was pretty hokey and pretty gimmicky.  But another little attraction for NBC.  It's just so funny to flip around the channels and see the difference in the coverage.  CBS, very conservative.  Very.  They don't want to call anything because of 2000.  And Dan Rather was saying that.  If I could stay awake to listen to him, he was saying, we don't want the events of four 
[00:11:30]  years ago to happen again.  So we are being very conservative.  We are not going to announce any winners of any states until the polls are closed, and  we have information.  CBS had, like, at one point, Bush with 18 electoral votes, and Kerry's seven, let's say.  Yeah.  And then you go to Fox, and they have, Bush has 228 electoral votes, and Kerry has 180 or 
[00:12:00]  whatever.  I'm like, what are they doing over there at Fox?  Fox News was declaring Bush the winner, like, hours before the state even started voting.  Right.  They were declaring a winner.  They were already saying, oh, Bush has won Wisconsin, and it's like, they haven't even  opened the polls yet, you idiot.  Fox News won, in my book, for the worst coverage whatsoever.  And not so much because of the inaccuracy or the jumping the gun on the Bush bandwagon that  they were doing, but their coverage was, it was five people, I guess, sitting around a 
[00:12:30]  table with no real good graphics behind them, no fancy electronics.  It looked like an NFL Today thing, where they were just going to sit around and bullshit  about football.  Oh, you had Terry Bradshaw throwing the football around?  Throwing the football around.  How many red states he could hit with the football?  There was nothing.  And then I switched to CNN, and they were in the NASDAQ building.  So they used all the screens that NASDAQ uses, and they had 50 screens, one for every 
[00:13:00]  state.  So they had the senatorial races on that.  They were able to go to the big screen for the big presidential numbers.  It was pretty good, pretty high tech.  I like all the high tech.  I need a lot of graphics.  I need the, what was it?  Was it CBS, I think, that had the graphic of the, whenever Bush took a state, you'd see  the graphic of the walking elephant inside the little seal on the side.  Then there's graphics down the side.  Decision 2004 is just scrolling down the side of the screen, and other electronics, futuristic 
[00:13:30]  graphics are popping out of everywhere.  I want that.  I like graphics.  And Fox News, you turn it on, they have their stupid ticker on the bottom, and a Decision  2004 on the bottom of the screen, and that was pretty much it.  They pretty much wanted to say, look, we control the election, and we're telling you that it's  going to be Bush, so stop watching everybody else.  NBC is going, okay, let's throw it down to the Decision Desk.  Yeah.  Down on the floor.  And they, like, have the Decision Desk, and let's go to our senior vote analyst correspondent 
[00:14:00]  on the floor.  They're throwing it all over the place.  And Fox?  Eh, crap.  They had five guys at a table.  The latest is a couple things.  First of all, this just in.  Anthony, Bush went to bed.  Oh, he did?  Bush decided to go to bed, and that's a...  He took a nap, Ski?  That's a headline right now, all over the TV, that Bush decided to go to bed.  Uh-huh.  He is pretty much declaring victory.  Oh, now the cover of the Post, I guess this is the latest edition of the Post, is W-2. 
[00:14:30]  So I guess they're declaring George W. Bush the winner.  Bush won, and he took Florida.  Good job.  Good job by the Democrats, really taking care of Florida.  Hey, great.  You idiots.  Hey, Michael Moore, great job.  Great job, Michael.  You really did it.  You did a bang-up job of getting your candidate elected.  Howard Stern.  Great job, Howard.  Howard Stern.  Great influence you had over all the voting, all the things I read about. 
[00:15:00]  Well, he could have an influence over the New York state vote.  It was a runaway landslide victory for Kerry in New York, but that just happens anyway.  What about the rest of the country?  Nothing.  Nothing.  Real, real great influence.  How about Puffy?  Great job.  Puffy, voter die.  Voter die.  That worked, Puffy.  Yeah.  How about 50 Cent and Paris Hilton wearing voter die shirts, and neither one of them voted?  Right.  Good job.  Bang-up job.  In the paper, they have Nicole. 
[00:15:30]  Is that the truth?  Oh, yeah.  Wait a minute.  Wait, what is that again?  They're wearing voter die shirts, and they didn't vote.  Yeah, and they said Ludacris says he mailed his in.  Mailed it in?  Yes, I'm sure he did.  Well, did he get to kill them now, because they didn't vote?  Yeah, voter die.  Yeah, he didn't vote, so it's time to die.  And then there was somebody else, another celebrity in the paper.  Paris Hilton should be wearing a shirt that says, voter get teabagged.  Oh, that's a good one.  It was Paris' sister, yeah.  Kerry's my homeboy.  That's the shirt she was wearing yesterday.  But they all did a great job.  Bruce, great job. 
[00:16:00]  Bruce Springsteen.  Bon Jovi.  Sean Penn.  Sarandon.  Susan Sarandon.  Great job.  Barbara Streisand.  Rosie O'Donnell.  Rosie.  You guys had a hell of an influence on the election.  What an influence you had.  Jon Stewart.  Jon Stewart, everybody.  What a great job you've done.  Good job, guys.  Good job.  Getting your candidate elected.  Your opinion counts.  You know something?  Not even close.  People are thinking, uh-oh, it's going to be another squeaker like it was in 2000, and 
[00:16:30]  we're going to have a recount, and the Republicans are once again going to try to steal the election  like they did in 2000.  Steal the election.  What they're saying now in the popular vote, the largest popular vote for a Republican president ever.  Well, slow down.  Ever.  Jesus, there's more people living in America.  I understand.  Let's calm down with the most votes ever.  I mean, we're not coming to work here in horse and buggies and wearing big, huge hats.  You're not?  Did you see me pull up this morning? 
[00:17:00]  I don't have mutton chops.  Of course, I had my little cane with the golden tip on it.  That crap is just BS, like, uh, stats.  It's spinning.  It's BS stats, okay?  There's more people in America, and that's why there's, uh, you know, more votes for Bush,  I guess.  But this wasn't even close, especially in Florida, where they were saying, oh, Florida, again,  we're going to have a problem with Florida.  It was a runaway for Bush.  It's done.  It wasn't close.  Bush took it.  Hey, do we have that, um, uh, the Edwards audio? 
[00:17:30]  He, I tell you, that guy has pizzazz at the microphone.  Pizzazz.  Oh, he's good.  Edwards.  What a guy.  This is the only audio we got from any of the, uh, candidates so far.  Well, no one was really able to say anything.  Kerry hasn't spoken.  Bush hasn't spoken.  Cheney is, uh, back in his bunker somewhere in the middle of, um, the desert, getting ready  for another four years.  Eating nitroglycerin.  Eating nitroglycerin like it's, like it's M&M's.  Jesus.  Uh, oh my God.  Four more years of this crap. 
[00:18:00]  I love it.  Holy S.  Four more years.  Oh my God.  You know, when it came down to it, I just didn't care.  I just didn't care.  Didn't care.  I wanted the Democrats to, you know, get somebody that we could get behind and, uh, and, uh,  they just couldn't get the job done.  If you were going to vote, uh, Democrat, it was, uh, ridiculous to, to vote in New York  State.  The state goes to the Democrats.  Uh, that's the way our, our election process works.  Uh, if these celebrities wanted their candidate to win so badly, California always goes Democrat 
[00:18:30]  also.  So their vote there could be best used elsewhere.  Why didn't those celebrities that are all yapping, yapping, yapping, pick up their ass  a year ago, get residency in Ohio, and, uh, vote there.  Vote Democrat there.  Really make a difference.  You know why?  Because they don't care.  They don't care.  They're not going to go out of their way to do anything.  Right, Jimmy?  I just, I just, what kind of an ass, though, wouldn't vote?  I mean, you know, these celebrities talk about it and they have the, uh, they want to talk 
[00:19:00]  and they don't want to vote.  Who did you vote for, Jimmy?  I never claimed I was going to.  You didn't vote?  No.  I'm registered in Jersey.  You had a lot more passion than Anthony and I about this election.  No, I was pretty passionate about it, and Opie and I got to say, I didn't cast a vote  either.  I did not cast a vote.  I was registered, all set up, ready to go.  I didn't vote.  You know why?  The lines were too long?  Yes, exactly.  It couldn't be inconvenienced.  I didn't think I needed to.  Well, they're saying that was a conspiracy, too. 
[00:19:30]  You know, they were shutting down, uh, uh, booths and stuff like that, you know, because  the Republicans were getting all paranoid, so they made it hard.  That's the new conspiracy, that they made it harder for the Democrats to vote.  I could not bring myself to vote for either of these candidates, or don't give me Nader,  you, don't even try to say, and don't give me the, cast a no vote.  Don't, don't do, I'm not doing that either.  I just could not bring myself to vote for either one of these candidates.  I don't believe in either of them. 
[00:20:00]  And, and, you know something?  I really didn't care which one won.  I didn't care.  One would have been good in some ways, one is good in other ways, one is an F up in one  way, one screws up in the other way.  I, it doesn't matter to me.  All right.  Can we hear the Edwards audio?  Oh, where's Edwards?  Yeah.  He's the only one that has spoken so far.  All these perky Democrats.  And this is what he's, um, saying right now.  It's been a long night, but we've waited four years for this victory. 
[00:20:30]  We can wait one more night.  There's more to that audio, right?  There's a part two, hopefully, because I think it's like a 90 second speech.  All right.  Let's hear the second part of this.  This election, every vote would count, and every vote would be counted.  That's all you got? 
[00:21:00]  Oh, boy.  No, no.  There's one more part, and it's four minutes long.  Oh.  Four minutes long?  That's not what I was listening to this morning.  That was the two, uh, first two soundbites we got off AP.  The third one is four minutes long.  Uh, let's try the third one.  We'll probably not play the whole thing, but I think maybe we could play the Hulk walking  away music as, uh, Edwards is speaking here.  Great.  He's delusional.  Great.  If I could, if I could find it.  Could I ask a question while Anthony's looking?  Uh, no.  I would like to know something.  No.  All right.  Go ahead, you idiot.  Jesus.  Why are you asking? 
[00:21:30]  Why is this ass saying things like, uh, we were going to count every vote and make every  vote?  Stop trying to be hip, stupid.  Do you have your mind on your money and your money on your mind as well?  You fat-headed douche.  They've got to have a little, like, crazy thing to say.  Instead of babbling, put that stupid dress on your fat wife and have her start singing.  It's over, Johnny.  It's not over until Edwards' wife sings.  Well, it's time to sing, you fat piece of crap. 
[00:22:00]  She really is a fatso.  I really have to do something with this.  I have to arrange these things better because I can never find anything.  Well, I could never, ever find what I'm looking for on these stupid templates.  Ever, ever, ever.  Because you have too many of them.  I have too many.  There are a lot of them.  I've got to just throw some away.  I've got to just throw some of these away.  All right.  As you, uh...  I hit one last night, and I'm not placing any blame on anybody.  I just understand that certain, you know, Eric wanted a lot of sounds on this thing, 
[00:22:30]  which is good, you know, to start out with, I guess.  Um, but I hit one yesterday, and I could swear I heard fucking Chandler from Friends on my...  Why is Chandler from Friends on my soundboard?  Eric, did you deem that cool, hip, and funny?  For this show to play a Chandler Bing clip?  When I'm on my gay board, when we were talking about homosexuals,  and I hit one that said something like, kiss the gay guy?  You got a gay board?  I have a gay...  I have one dedicated just to homosexuals. 
[00:23:00]  Let's hear some of the clips on your gay board.  You're a little bitch.  That's right.  You're a bitch, and I'd bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you?  Gay.  Totally gay.  Liberace gay.  That's cool.  Dude, this is gay.  Right?  Yeah, sure.  South Park is very good.  Oh, you're a big tough cunt, you faggot, ain't you?  That's good.  I like that.  P.S.  I am gay.  Homer gay.  That's good.  That's good.  What is this faggot crap?  That's good.  You have a whole gay board.  Right?  Right.  Oh, if I knew it, they'd turn you into poofters. 
[00:23:30]  Poofters?  Those men...  There's a classic.  ...want to have sex with me.  And then I hit this one.  Yeah.  And yesterday, I was like, what the...  Whatever, dude.  You kissed a guy.  No, not that one.  Hold on.  You kissed a guy?  In my defense, it was dark, and he was a very pretty guy.  It's Chandler fucking Bing.  Why is a Chandler clip on the board on the O.P. and Anthony show?  Hold on.  Let's slow down a minute.  Yes?  You know his last name?  You know his character's last name?  Dude, the show was on for how many years?  I don't know it. 
[00:24:00]  I'm a TV connoisseur.  I know everything.  That means you watch Friends.  I know about it.  I know it's not appropriate for this program.  What's Chandler's last name?  Bing.  Bing?  Yeah.  Oh.  All right.  I just know that.  How does he know that?  I know everything about television.  I'm a fan of TV.  All right.  But not of that clip.  Eric, that clip must go.  It will go.  All right.  Now, the Hulk Walking Away music.  Did you find it?  Do you know where it is, Eric?  Yeah.  All right.  Eric will find it for you.  All right.  Let's see where it is. 
[00:24:30]  One, two, or three?  Should be two.  Two.  All right.  All right.  Why don't we play the, uh, are we ready for this?  None.  Oh, boy.  Oh, maybe not.  Oh, not two.  A couple other things as he finds that, Anthony.  Yeah.  I want to let people know that Marion Barry has won.  They elected Marion Barry again in D.C.  In D.C.  D.C. should stand for dumb.  Well, I don't know.  All right. 
[00:25:00]  Let's come down over there.  Oh, my God.  Unbelievable.  I guess he's, uh, was elected in one of the poorest districts down there.  Of course.  And, uh, so they love him.  So he won.  And then.  He's got the crackhead constituency.  And then.  It just goes right after him.  And then just something for our New York listeners.  Although maybe we can put this on our website.  Put this on our website.  Uh, opianthony.com.  There's a picture of Governor Pataki voting.  And Anthony made the observation.  You're not sure if he's voting or if, or if he's, uh, going into a glory hole. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, it is really something.  Jimmy, you've got to see this picture.  Page 10.  Page 10.  Check this out.  Look at Pataki.  I know this is a visual.  But then you have the old lady laughing as he's in the booth.  He's in the booth.  And you can see, like, from his knees down because the curtain doesn't go all the way to the floor.  And it looks like he's leaning way too far in to try to, you know, pull that lever.  He's 6'5", Pataki.  Very tall guy.  So he's in the voting booth trying to vote.  And he had to squat down.  But the curtain goes down to about his ass so you can't see the top half of him. 
[00:26:00]  And he's just bent at the knees like he's sticking his junk in the voting booth.  Yeah.  All right.  Did we find it?  All right.  Let's listen to some more of this Edwards audio.  This is the only audio we have from any of the guys.  Play the audio now.  It's right there, Derek.  Oh, my God.  These guys are asleep.  No, there's no four-minute clip.  Asleep at the wheel.  No, there's two separate short clips.  He's got them right here.  All right.  Play those again.  The first one.  Play the first one.  Oh, my God.  There you go.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It's been a long night. 
[00:26:30]  But we've waited four years for this victory.  We can wait one more night.  This election, every vote would count, and every vote would be counted.  Vote for the count?  Huh?  Boo, vote for me.  Mr. Edwards, it's time to just walk away. 
[00:27:00]  Just walk away.  I was watching some of the...  You had your moment in the spotlight.  It's time to walk away.  It's done.  Go the way of every other vice presidential candidate that didn't win.  That you never heard from again, ever.  Goodbye.  Like Geraldine Ferraro.  Geraldine Ferraro.  Ferraro.  Yeah.  Who else?  Who else?  I don't even know.  I don't even know.  Lloyd Benson.  Who ran with Al Gore?  I don't even remember.  I don't remember.  I don't remember.  I don't remember.  I don't remember.  Walter Mondale.  Walter Mondale. 
[00:27:30]  Who ran with Al Gore?  Who ran without Gore?  Not wait.  Wait.  Oh my God.  It was only four years ago.  People are screaming at their videos.  Who ran with Gore?  See?  Gore and...  That's what you have to look forward to, Edwards.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And we're pretty much up on pop culture and politics and stuff.  Oh my God.  Wait a minute.  Why can't we ran with Gore?  It was Gore and Gash.  No, Gore and...  Gore and Gash?  Who's Gash?  I'm just...  Gore and...  Who the... 
[00:28:00]  I'm trying to picture the bumper stickers.  Gore and...  It was Lieberman.  Lieberman.  Oh my God.  The Jewish guy.  I thought Lieberman and I'm like, no, it wasn't Lieberman.  Lieberman.  Dude, that's not even a bit.  I can't believe we forgot.  Hey, Lieberman.  I did remember that and I didn't say it.  All right.  Yeah.  Was it Lieberman?  I think so.  No.  I don't think it was.  No?  Yeah, it was Lieberman, you idiots.  It's gotta be.  Yeah, yeah.  It was Lieberman.  Okay.  I was watching some of the people, the Democrats, talking about the election last night. 
[00:28:30]  And even at the end of the night when it's looking like, you know, George Bush is gonna  win.  And they have this thing that they do.  They never concede defeat.  The one guy was saying, and when John Kerry is president-elect tomorrow, we will prove that...  And he can't not see what's going on.  I know.  I don't understand that.  They can't be setting themselves up for such disappointment.  He's lying. 
[00:29:00]  Because he can't sit there looking at what's happening and really think he's gonna be president.  And then the morning comes and they're like, but I really thought it was gonna happen.  They'll all be weeping.  It's so funny.  They just get on and lie.  You know he's not gonna win.  You know an hour into the election that he's not gonna win.  Unbelievable.  Not even close.  So John Edwards, just take a blue ribbon and put it on your awful wife and go back to your  rotten state.  Make her put on her red dress and get her singing, because it's over, Johnny. 
[00:29:30]  All right.  As we go to break, here's a Bush song.  Don't worry.  It's not Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  People bitching that we're playing that one too much.  Here's Imagine and Walk on the Wild Side.  A guy, I don't even know his name.  I'd love to give him the credit.  Went through all of Bush's speeches, and he makes little songs.  Here's Imagine.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Imagine there's no heaven. 
[00:30:00]  It's easy if you try.  No hell below us.  Above us, only sky.  Imagine all the people living for today. 
[00:30:30]  The color of girl's city.  Take a walk on the wild side.  One, two, three, four.  Imagine yourself, countries.  It isn't hard to do that.  Nothing to kill or die for.  No religion, too. 
[00:31:00]  Imagine all the people living life at peace.  The color of girl's city.  Take a walk on the wild side.  Take a walk on the wild side. 
[00:31:30]  Imagine your possessions.  I wonder if you can.  No need for greed or hunger.  A brotherhood of man.  Imagine all the people.  Sharing all the world. 
[00:32:00]  The color of girls.  Take a walk on the wild side.  I wonder if you can.  I wonder if you can.  I wonder if you can.  I wonder if you can.  Take a walk on the wild side.  Take a walk on the wild side.  Take a walk on the wild side. 
[00:32:30]  Take a walk on the wild side.  Take a walk on the wild side.  Take a walk on the wild side.  Take a walk on the wild side.  Take a walk on the wild side.  Take a walk on the wild side.  Take a walk on the wild side.  Take a walk on the wild side.  Take a walk on the wild side.  Take a walk on the wild side.  Take a walk on the wild side.  Take a walk on the wild side.  Take a walk on the wild side.  Take a walk on the wild side.  Take a walk on the wild side.  It was Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, so I flashed some guy on the Long Island Expressway.  He was involved in a seven-car pileup.  There was blood and carnage everywhere. 
[00:33:00]  But my tits looked great.  Please, wow responsibly.  A public service announcement of the Opie and Anthony Show.  I don't like the fact that we get 5% of our oil from Saddam Hussein.  Is that unbelievable?  That just blows my mind.  What about Alaska?  Are we just never going to do anything with Alaska, ever?  Just tell me.  I'll go along with everybody.  But nothing, ever?  We got it for like four bucks in mallow cup money. 
[00:33:30]  The Ruskies were in yet another vodka stupor.  They had no idea what they were giving up.  We even called it Seward's Folly.  And all of a sudden it's Valhalla.  Why is that?  Because the caribou are there?  The caribou?  I didn't even know what it was.  I had the research that a caribou is a large North American reindeer.  He's a reindeer who couldn't make the show.  Yet somehow they've managed to get their own state. 
[00:34:00]  It's textbook passive-aggressive behavior.  They just nibble on that berry and give you that fern gully look.  Start batting their eyes.  Play the species card on you.  Oh, don't hurt me evil biped.  And we give them Alaska.  We only have 50 states.  We've given one to a herd of Simu bullwinkles.  What's up with nature? 
[00:34:30]  Why so whiny?  Why so soft?  No snowmobiles in Yellowstone Park now?  I mean, for God's sakes, what are we supposed to do with nature?  Just look at it?  What is it, like porn with leaves?  Where's this delicate balance of nature I always hear so much about?  Every time I watch Animal Planet, there's some rabid harp seal chucking penguins down his gullet like they were maitre d' Tic Tacs.  You know, to me, nature always appears more unbalanced than Nick Nolte with a clogged eustachian tube. 
[00:35:00]  Global warming?  Well, listen, this sounded legit to me, so I thought I'd best do some research.  I don't want to piss away on this one until I know what's up.  I've got kids.  Now, there's a lot of differing data, but as far as I can gather, the crux of it is, over the last hundred years,  the temperature of this planet has gone up 1.8 degrees.  Am I the only one who finds that amazingly stable?  You know, I'm always amazed, as per chaos theory, I don't wake up one morning and it's 3,000 degrees, 
[00:35:30]  and I'm just a big Kingsford briquette and a pair of jammies.  1.8? Are you kidding me?  I could go back to my hotel room tonight and fucks with a thermostat for the next three or four hours.  I could not detect that difference.  You know, I'm kind of glad it went up.  I'm always a little chilly anyway.  And, you know, the money I'm saving on sweaters, I put into a cookie jar to buy a 30-06 to blow a caribou's head off with. 
[00:36:00]  It's the circle of life, Simba.  But environmentalists, they don't want to hear it.  They get really cranky.  They'll give you that guilt card.  Well, what about your kids?  Of course I love my kids.  I hope they live to be 100.  It's another 1.8. 
[00:36:30]  And they give you, what about your kids' kids?  3.6.  I, uh...  You know, just tell them we moved to Phoenix or something.  Then they get really crazy on you.  Well, what about your kids' kids' kids' kids' kids' kids' kids' kids' kids' kids' kids' kids' kids' kids?  You know, I'm never going to meet them.  I'd like to tell you they matter, but they don't.  You get around four kids out there, I don't give a shit anymore.  I assume I had relatives thousands of years ago who could care less about me. 
[00:37:00]  Well, should I leave the cave today and use a blunt instrument to kill a mastodon and procure some meat,  or should I get ready for Dennis' arrival in the mid-1900s?  Wilma, what time's this flight getting in, honey?  So I was in the grocery store, and there was this stock boy stacking melons.  So I figured, hey, I'll show him some real melons.  Well, when I flashed him, he lost his balance, and the entire stack of melons came crashing down on him.  He was suffocated under two tons of melons, but my melons are still juicy and perky. 
[00:37:30]  Please, wow responsibly.  A public service announcement of the Opie and Anthony Show.  By the way, it's Whippin' Out Wednesday.  You know the wild thing, right, Anthony?  Of course you do.  Of course.  We came up with this thing about eight years ago, maybe seven, I don't know. 
[00:38:00]  Not really keeping track.  Wow, Imus!  Our buddy Imus is on the TV.  Oh.  Looking awful, but...  Yeah, but it's on MSNBC.  Yeah, it's Whippin' Out Wednesday.  Basically, you put wow on the back of your truck or your car, and if a girl sees that and she's feeling like it,  she's going to flash her boobs as you're driving down the highway.  It works like a charm, man.  Yes, it does.  And if you need a wow sticker, they're finally getting them out to our listeners down there in Washington.  You go to opianthony.com, you leave your name, and they'll send off a Whippin' Out Wednesday bumper sticker. 
[00:38:30]  Okay?  What's wrong, Jimmy?  I'm good.  I just used the restroom, and I didn't tap right, and I just dropped a gallon of fluid into my pants walking back in.  Oh, I hate that.  You've got to really take time.  You know, if you're pressed for time, you're going to have a problem and maybe have a little stain.  But, yeah, you've really got to take time and stand there and beat that thing out.  Yeah.  I'm borderline incontinent.  I mean, I'm always ridiculous how much I leak into my pants. 
[00:39:00]  Well, what kind of...  See, you wear boxers, right?  Now I'm wearing silk boxers, too, so that...  Oh, no absorption.  Oh, that's really smart to wear silk boxers.  Why, they're comfortable.  Yeah, but you're getting boners left and right.  Not with just you two in the studio, I'm not.  Yeah, but if you rub against something with silk boxers on...  I know.  Dude, all it takes is a girl to talk a little dirty on the phone, and you're sporting, and you've got the silk on top of it.  Yeah, so you're an explosion waiting to happen in your pants.  You're going to squeeze your mule in silk boxers.  It just looks wonderful.  Silk sheets, too, are a good thing on the bed. 
[00:39:30]  Really?  Yeah, you could kind of...  If you lay it over yourself, you could see your mule right through it.  Just gaze at its glory.  Do you really do that?  Do you lay on your back and pull it up to your chin, your little...  Yeah, pull it up to my chin and go...  I know, I did it.  I did it, like, here in the studio.  I did the pulling up to my chin thing.  I'm just picturing you and looking at your mule like that.  I look down and go, well, look at my mule.  Did you all snuggled up?  That's why I wear the briefs.  You've got to wear the briefs. 
[00:40:00]  Just because, you know, if you're pressed for time, you get a little of that absorption.  So it's not dripping down your leg.  It's a brief boxer combo.  The boxer brief?  Yeah.  Those are fine, but briefs, I can't...  Briefs look like diapers.  They really do.  I can't wear them.  Who's looking?  They really do.  I just can't wear them.  I had a girl tell me that she...  This girl, a British chick I used to date, told me that she would never...  Fucking limey.  Oh, yeah, she was awful.  But she would never bang a guy who wore boxers.  The only people who wear briefs these days are like eight-year-old boys.  Yeah. 
[00:40:30]  They run around with their little briefs.  I'll say they do.  You don't wear the fruit of the lumber.  Don't goof on me and then go, oh, we're going to go.  What is that?  I'm a little worried about you today.  You watch Friends.  You know Chandler's last name.  I don't watch Friends.  I knew Chandler's last name because I know TV trivia.  And you forgot who Gore's running mate was.  That's easily forgettable.  All the good knowledge is leaving your head, I think.  That is easily forgettable.  It really was.  You wear the boxer briefs? 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  I think you do that just because it's the hip thing to do.  No, it's just...  I think you're trying to be hip.  No, it's more comfortable.  How are they more comfortable?  Because we're briefs.  I've tried them and they're not more comfortable.  It's more material on your legs.  Well, if you've got a big schlong, it's more comfortable.  It lets it hang a little bit better.  Oh, stop it.  I don't know.  I think you're trying to portray it like people don't wear briefs.  All right.  And I think a lot of people in the red states wear briefs.  All right. 
[00:41:30]  Don't worry.  You're not alone.  He's wearing silk boxers like he's a porn star.  Yeah, I really am an ass.  Jesus.  Like hefter.  Honestly, that is the word.  Yeah, the hef.  They're comfortable, though.  I can't wear them on a plane because you slide when you're trying to, like, when you want  to sleep.  Silk isn't good long-term for anything.  They're not comfortable.  They're not.  They are.  They're just not comfortable.  Dude, I'm telling you.  I've had, like, chicks when the chicks rub on you, like, that's fantastic.  Well, we'll change into your silk when you know you're getting action, but just  walking around New York, it can't be comfortable.  Silk is good for action.  Things like underwear and silk sheets also, good for action. 
[00:42:00]  But afterwards, you need to squeegee it off, and then they're not comfortable to really  sleep in, especially on warm days.  Do you have silk sheets?  I have a set.  I don't put it on the bed a lot.  For those special moments?  For those special moments when the candles come out.  Ugh.  But wearing silk boxers, it seems like silk against your body, especially if you're wearing  clothes, wouldn't get a little sweaty.  No.  They don't breathe. 
[00:42:30]  The silk doesn't breathe that well.  How do we go from politics to silk boxers?  That's why the show is so great.  We weave in and out of things, because everyone's talking about politics now.  Ka-ching, ka-ching, ka-ching.  Well, if you want to hear about clear stuff in a pair of silk boxes, you come to XM Radio  this morning.  These idiots will not call this election still.  It's over.  It's over.  It is so over.  Bush is, all they've got to do is wake him up out of his coma, and he'll give the acceptance  speech.  I wonder how he stayed awake all night.  You think he did a few lines like old times? 
[00:43:00]  A little toot.  A little toot.  Just a couple.  Pulls out the little vial with the presidential seal on it.  Yeah, get that little spoon out.  Imagine.  I got him all bamboozled.  Just a line for old time's sake.  Yeah, why not?  I'm going to be in office for four years.  It doesn't matter now.  Wash it down with a little bourbon in a glass.  Now that he just wasted the last year of his presidency to make sure he got re-elected.  That's what I hate about this crap.  If you're the sitting president, it should be that you have to work at making the country 
[00:43:30]  better, and you shouldn't be allowed to campaign.  Oh, he did nothing.  He did nothing in the last year except make sure he was going to be re-elected.  Cover his ass is what he did over the past year.  Try to cover his ass.  And nothing really got done.  Do you see what's happening in Iraq?  Really nothing.  We're in a stalemate, and soldiers are getting killed.  Now I think he's going to do something.  I think since he's elected, and now he's got four more years, now he can be a little  more decisive and maybe do something.  Well, that's what scares me.  I would like to see that. 
[00:44:00]  I don't like it just sitting there doing jack shit, getting our guys killed.  But that's where he goes back to being, I don't give a crap what you guys think.  I'm going to do it my way.  Well, the last year, year and a half, we've had him under control a little bit with this  election.  I mean, let's be honest.  He really couldn't do much.  He's a little scary.  I like a go-getter president, don't get me wrong.  But he's a little scary when he isn't being influenced by being re-elected or something.  You think North Korea, Iran, all of them are next?  Oh, yeah.  Syria cannot be happy with these poll results. 
[00:44:30]  Syria's not calling the election either in their coverage.  Nobody with foreskin is happy that Bush got elected.  No, no.  Nobody.  Well, just like when the Red Sox beat the Yankees.  When?  Huh?  When did that happen?  Oh, they cheated.  The A-Rod call was bogus.  All right, let's relax on that.  He's calling back, and we've got to give him some more condolences this morning.  It's our buddy Earl.  Black Earl.  Earl, I'm very, very sorry this election didn't go your way. 
[00:45:00]  Well, I know the Shwoogies are not happy today.  How could they be?  Who?  The Shwoogies.  Oh, God.  Could you stop?  That's what they call black people in Anthony's neighborhood, the Shwoogies.  Not in my neighborhood.  Earl, what's the word on the street?  How did Bush steal another election?  Steal.  There you go.  See?  That's the...  There you go.  That's what it's going to be.  Black man's opinion.  There you go.  That's what the black men are saying today.  He stole another election.  You know, Stern is blaming Clear Channel.  Freaking idiot. 
[00:45:30]  Of course.  And the black people are saying that Bush stole another election.  How did Bush steal another election there, Earl?  Go ahead, Earl.  Elaborate.  Well, the big swing states were, was it Ohio, Pennsylvania?  Uh-huh.  And there was...  Kerry took Pennsylvania, by the way.  Oh, he did?  Yes, he did.  All right.  So now what about the swing states?  Yeah.  What were you saying, Earl?  Well, there were stories of, let's just say, voter intimidation.  Voter intimidation.  I heard about this. 
[00:46:00]  I heard moveon.org was slashing tires of some people.  But then, as a comeback, and get this...  Wait, wait, wait.  Back up.  They were slashing the tires of Democratic voters?  Republican people.  Republicans had their tires slashed.  Yeah, move on.  Oh, okay.  That's why I was getting confused.  Real left-wing militant organizations.  They were slashing the tires of Republicans.  Republicans and people that were trying to get the vote out for Republicans.  But the Republicans, what a great gimmick this was, was sending out flyers and mailers 
[00:46:30]  to black Democrats in a lot of the urban locations that said, please get out and vote November 3rd.  No, they weren't.  Yes, they weren't.  November 3rd.  I'm here to vote.  That was yesterday.  Damn Republicans got me again.  That could be the greatest thing I've ever heard.  That is a great scam.  Show me that flyer.  Come on.  They're making those flyers.  But that is a great scam, man. 
[00:47:00]  Come on.  You've got to give it to them.  Earl, so there's conspiracy in this or what?  Are you voting today, Earl?  I just voted yesterday to stop it.  All right.  Well, I'm sorry for you and your fellow shwoogies.  And do it.  You didn't go your way.  And you know what?  You're not going to get a Democrat in office anytime soon.  Because now it's going to be about Hillary for the next four years.  Oh, the party's a mess.  No, no, no, no.  I've got to disagree with you, Opie.  This is when Democrats kind of rally.  Because when they screw up this badly, for two elections in a row, they pull out a Clinton. 
[00:47:30]  They're able to find someone and groom them like they did Bill Clinton.  Obama!  Bring on Obama!  From Illinois!  Opie, the first black president has yet to be born.  He is not even born yet.  This nation is starting to soften as far as the Tiger Wood black guy.  If he is born, Alex Haley is holding him up.  And he is a little infant.  The Tiger Wood black guy? 
[00:48:00]  Us white people, we're kind of like softening when it comes to black people if they look like Tiger Woods.  Is whitey softening up?  A little bit.  If you're like Tiger Woods black, we're feeling you a little bit.  If you're Mickey Rivers black, we're still scared.  We're still really scared.  Mickey, oh God.  That's classic.  Yeah, that's a 1977 reference.  Great.  I couldn't think of another black guy that is so black that he looks purple.  I'm sure the whole country knows who Mickey Rivers is.  I know. 
[00:48:30]  Look at Google Mickey Rivers and see how black that guy is.  My God.  Obama, the only black senator.  Come on, bring on Obama.  He's the only black senator out of the hundred?  He's barely black, though.  He's Tiger Woods black, and I think the nation's going to warm up to that.  I don't know.  He kind of looked like Farrakhan.  Yes, he does.  Doesn't he?  He looks like Farrakhan.  That's going to scare a lot of whitey away.  That's just the way he looks.  He kind of looks like if you put that little bow tie on, he'd frighten a lot of white people away.  Let's be honest.  There's just not going to be a black president in our lifetime. 
[00:49:00]  You saw those red states.  Oh, I know.  Come on.  It's easy to sit in New York and assume, or California, that there could be a black president sometime soon.  Look at the red states.  They were voting to define marriage as a union between man and woman, and that's it.  And they voted on it in a lot of these states.  And it was, you know, 100%.  They were voting in Mississippi and Oklahoma.  Can we just, like, break off the penis of the United States and become our own country? 
[00:49:30]  You want to break off the northernmost penis?  Yeah, the north.  The one with Maine and Massachusetts.  The northeast looks like kind of like a deformed penis.  Right under New York?  You want to take Jersey with us or no?  We'll take Jersey.  We need some ballies.  You've got to take Jersey.  We need some ballies.  Yeah.  We'll take Jersey.  We'll take Pennsylvania.  Jersey is the sack.  Jersey and Pennsylvania is the sack.  Wear the sensitive underside.  And Maine is just...  Maine is the big knob.  And Maine is just blowing spunk into the Atlantic Ocean. 
[00:50:00]  That's what I want.  That's my country.  Because the rest of this country is downright scary.  Until you get to the other side, like California.  Which is scary in its own right.  It's scary, too.  And the first black president is going to be, A, probably through a vice presidential thing.  And it's going to be Republican.  It's not going to be Democrat.  It's going to be a conservative Republican.  It's going to be not Alan Keyes.  Conservative Republican.  Right.  Yes.  You're right.  All right, Earl.  As a vice president first.  In other words, an Uncle Tom.  Amen.  It's going to be an Uncle Tom. 
[00:50:30]  A black guy that calls other black guys rabble-rousers.  That's the kind of black guy that's going to be.  That's the only one that white America would accept.  Or Colin Powell, I think, if he was ran as vice president.  I don't know why somebody doesn't grab him as Republican.  For the next time.  Have McCain and Powell, I would like to see, run together.  Nah, he blew it.  They're already saying to counter Hillary, they might run Condoleezza Rice.  Oh, shut up.  Hillary has a much higher profile than Condoleezza Rice.  I don't think Hillary runs.  That's when they break out Giuliani to smack her upside her head. 
[00:51:00]  Again, look at the red states.  And calm her down.  Look at the red states.  You're not going to get Hillary.  They are not going to vote for Hillary, the red states.  It's going to be just like it was today.  You'll get the same results.  If Hillary was running against Bush, let's say, you would get the same exact results that  Kerry's getting right now.  And again, I don't see them rallying around Condoleezza Rice either.  No.  On the red states.  No.  They will stick to what is winning.  They will stick to what works.  The first people that are going to try some bonehead move, and I don't mean that as a pun 
[00:51:30]  or anything, is the Democrats, they're going to try some gimmicky way to get themselves  in there.  And that doesn't work.  It's a gimmick.  It doesn't work.  You've got to get somebody that they get behind, like Bill Clinton, that was able to really  rally people, had a great way to speak.  Obama!  Ain't going to work?  Nope.  All right, Earl.  Ain't going to work?  Thank you, Earl.  All right.  Bye, Earl. 
[00:52:00]  Well, we might be boring people to death with our politics today, but there you go.  Fuck them.  Amen.  What's happening?  It's the big story.  There's a couple other little stories in the paper that we'll get to.  There's a really good one, actually, on the way.  No, it's funny, too.  They're saying that Tom Brokaw refuses to leave his seat.  Oh, I know.  You see him?  He's still there.  We got here at 4.30, 4.45, and Dan Rather was still doing his reports.  I don't know what's going on now, because we're trying to do the radio show.  And it was the same with Tom Brokaw.  These guys are refusing to leave their deaths until they can declare a winner, even though 
[00:52:30]  everyone knows it's going to be Bush.  Yeah, he will not leave.  And as far as Brokaw goes, he's not leaving, because this is it for him.  It's over, Johnny.  Pretty much it.  This is pretty much his last broadcast.  His last hurrah.  It's not about declaring Bush a winner.  He doesn't want to leave his seat.  I'm sitting here in the ice skating rink just to keep my ass awake.  My testicles are very cold as I sit on the swing state of Ohio, which is turning blue because 
[00:53:00]  of my nutsack.  What are you going to do now, Tom?  I have no idea.  I think I'm going to play golf with old people.  I read that somewhere.  It's what people do when they're out of work.  I don't know what to do.  I'll be off.  Maybe I'll just go fishing, like what's his name, and get some trouser trout up in Massachusetts.  You know what, Tom?  You know what you have to do?  What?  You got to just walk away. 
[00:53:30]  Do I have to walk away?  You just have to walk away.  It's been great, Tom.  It's been a wonderful...  I grew up watching you, and I think it's just time for you to just turn your back and  walk away.  It's been a wonderful 85 years at NBC Nightly News.  I think it was more like 30...  42 years at 37...  30, I don't know.  28 years at NBC Nightly News.  Tom, walk away.  We're going to need the blazer.  No, I can't walk away yet.  We're going to need the blazer.  Give me the blazer, Tom. 
[00:54:00]  Ohio is not in yet.  Take the blazer!  Take the blazer!  Until Ohio is in, I am...  No, Tom, it's over.  No, no, no.  Give up my feet here in Democracy Plaza.  Tom, get...  You got to go.  You got to go.  Leave me alone.  I'm going to stay here.  You have no place to go, I know, but you got to go.  You got to go.  Now, go!  Take them out of here.  Many electoral...  Take them out of here!  ...electrical votes left that aren't...  Tom, thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, Tom.  I'm going to stay here in Democracy Plaza. 
[00:54:30]  No, you're not, Tom.  It's over.  It's over.  Bye, Tom.  Unhand me.  Bye, Tom.  And we're going to need the NBC Blazer back.  I'm sorry.  There he goes.  They drag off.  Tom broke off.  Last time.  Bye-bye.  All right, as we...  You are fired!  Oh, he's not fired?  You're fired?  He just...  He should have played.  He has no place else to go.  Huh?  No place left to go?  Tom, any final comments?  It's over, Johnny.  No, it's over, Tommy.  Don't you do it!  Oh.  Don't! 
[00:55:00]  No!  I got nowhere else to go!  That was Tom's last words.  I got nowhere else to go!  As they throw him onto the street.  Bye, Tom.  I got nothing else.  Oh, he's got nothing else.  All right, we're going to go to break, but we want to play the Tony Danza thing from yesterday.  Huh?  Everyone is talking about this Tony Danza thing.  It was unbelievable, actually.  We sent one of our interns to the Tony Danza line, and we got one of the ladies on the phone 
[00:55:30]  that obviously comes from one of those red states.  A red state woman.  And she really thought she was talking to Tony Danza.  She was waiting online to go into his show.  Why would she think anything different?  Can we go to it?  Yeah?  Okay, we could go to it.  So check this out, and we'll be back.  And I think we're going to try to do Stoner Spelling Bee today, Anthony.  Ooh, fun, fun, fun.  And we've got to get some sex back into this radio show.  It's all about balance, so we need some sex today on the show. 
[00:56:00]  Maybe a queef.  Maybe a Guess What's in My Pants.  Maybe a couple trying to become the sexiest state in America.  I would like to hear a queef.  Really?  They're fun to hear.  I think they're disgusting, but over the phone, they're kind of fun.  We really need to bring the sex back into the show,  so hopefully we'll do that next.  All right?  Hello?  Hello?  Who's this?  Nathaniel.  Oh, what's up, buddy?  What do you got?  I got Debra in the Tony Danza line.  Oh, is she a big Tony Danza fan?  Huge fan.  All right.  Is she a fatty?  I'm sorry? 
[00:56:30]  Is she a fatty?  Not really.  Okay.  All right.  We'll talk to her.  All right.  Here you go.  Hello?  Hello, Debra.  Hi.  Hi, it's Tony Danza, Debra.  Hi.  How are you, Tony?  Real good.  I hear you're waiting to get in on my show.  I can't wait.  You can't wait, huh?  I hear my little friend Leslie, and it's her birthday today.  Leslie?  How old is she today?  Oh, I don't think she wants me to tell you that.  Oh, come on.  How old are you today, Leslie?  She said 39. 
[00:57:00]  39.  You need to be the judge.  Hey, happy birthday, huh?  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday.  Hey, my thoughts and prayers are with her on this fine birthday for her.  Tony, you know who I thought you should have been for Halloween?  Who?  I thought you should have been Sammy Davis, because I watched the tape when you did the tribute  to Sammy Davis.  Remember your tap dance?  Oh, of course.  I love hoofing like Sammy.  I know, but I thought you should have been him for Halloween.  Well, actually, I went with the Spider-Man.  Did you see?  I didn't like that. 
[00:57:30]  I didn't like it either.  I needed an apron to cover that up.  You know what I'm talking about, huh?  I know what you're talking about.  Hey, Tony Danza junk, hanging out all over the place.  No, that was not for anybody to see.  No, not for public consumption, huh?  No, I don't like those outfits.  I needed a dressing room just for my car.  I didn't hear you.  A bus just went by.  Yeah, the bus went by.  Good thing, huh?  Perfect timing.  Thank God.  So what do you like about my show?  I think you're very real.  I think you're very fresh.  I think you're just...  Wait till you see how fresh I can be. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, no, no, no, no.  I think you're just...  You're very wonderful.  You're gracious to your guests.  You're gracious to us that are watching you at home.  Hey, thank you so much.  I want to tell you something, Debra.  We are gonna...  Do you know where you're sitting for the audience?  No, I don't.  Well, we have VIP tickets.  I don't know what that means.  My husband's friend got them for us.  Well, let me tell you what that means.  You are going to be in the front row,  and I'm going to come over during the show and talk to you. 
[00:58:30]  Okay.  You're going to be on television,  and I'm going to, you know,  talk a little bit about the news, maybe the election.  Who'd you vote for?  I didn't vote yet.  I'm voting after I leave you.  And who are you going to vote for?  I'm not quite sure.  How about vote for Tony?  You know?  All right.  Yeah.  Okay.  Would I be able to get a picture with you?  Oh, absolutely.  Okay.  I actually want to pull my mule out,  put it on your shoulder,  and take a picture like that.  Pull your what out? 
[00:59:00]  My mule.  A mule?  A mule.  You know how I ride up on different things every time?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm going to have a mule.  You know what I would rather you do?  A big mule right in your face.  My mule.  You know what I would rather you do when you open the show?  I'd rather you open it up with a song.  Oh, you like when I sing?  I do.  I think you should do what you do best.  And what's that?  I have no clue.  When we were at Regis, I bought my CD in,  and you said being I was the only person  that had your CD in the audience, 
[00:59:30]  you came over and you signed it.  And I think that's how you should open the show,  rather than do the silly stuff.  Oh, you don't like the silly stuff?  No, I like that you honored your father  when you came in on the garbage truck.  Hey, well, thoughts and prayers, you know?  Right.  I like everything that's sentimental and everything.  Yeah, sentimental.  Like my mule.  Like the stilts, you made me very nervous.  Oh, you didn't like the stilts?  It was kind of dangerous, wasn't it?  No, because...  Danger is my middle name. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, well, you have to be careful.  Hello?  Hey, I'm so happy that you're coming on the show.  I am, too.  Could you describe yourself  so I know what you look like when I walk up to you?  Okay, I have blonde hair, brown eyes.  I have on a...  Angela.  I have on, like, an argyle sweater.  Black.  Look at that off.  With different colors in it.  Yeah.  And I have my friend Leslie with me,  and she has short blonde hair. 
[01:00:30]  How many...  Well, what do you look like as far as your body-wise,  so I could distinguish you from other blondes?  Oh, I'm pretty good.  Oh, you're hot, huh?  Yeah, I'm pretty good.  Yeah?  Hey, you know...  I have to hang up.  How would you like to go out with me tonight?  I would love to.  You want to go out with Tony?  I would love to.  Tony and my mule.  Okay.  Yeah?  Hey, do you take it up the ass?  Goodbye.  Hey, Debra.  Debra.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Enjoy the show. 
[01:01:00]  Hello?  Well...  Nathaniel.  Yes, I am walking away fast.  What happened?  What happened at the end there?  She goes...  She looked at me and goes,  he was nasty at the end.  She still thinks it was Tony?  I think so.  Oh, God.  That was awful.  Yeah.  How is she going to look at him now in that show?  All of a sudden, she just gets up and belts him in the face. 
[01:01:30]  For no reason.  All right.  Great job, buddy.  Thanks.  Try to find one more person that wants to talk to Tony Danza, okay?  I was walking down the street,  and some construction guy was shouting at me,  Hey, show me your cans.  So I did.  And he plummeted 17 floors  and was impaled on a forklift.  But my tits looked great.  Please, wow responsibly.  Today, a public service announcement of the O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[01:02:00]  I like ugly women.  You don't have to beg ugly women.  Yeah, they just up and give you something.  You know what I mean?  My last four wives been ugly.  The one I got now beat all of them.  God damn, that's an ugly woman.  I got laying home.  I got to go home now in the night  and lay down next to her  with a soft on. 
[01:02:30]  With a soft on.  You fellas remember what I'm talking about, don't you?  You're sitting there with one, aren't you?  Unless you get horny for comedians.  Don't get horny for me.  I ain't like that.  That's got a bad foot.  Laugh out loud, honey. 
[01:03:00]  Enjoy yourself.  He brought you here.  He knew y'all was going to tell some stories like this.  I told the story of the first show.  A good story.  It was two veterans went to Vietnam  and served their time.  Won the Congressional Medal of Honor.  Came back to Washington, D.C.  to receive their medals.  Walked in the White House.  President Nixon said,  well, what would you fellas like?  He said, beside the medal,  I'm going to give you whatever you like.  One fella said,  I'll take a hundred acres and a tractor.  Prez.  The other brothers looked at the president.  He said, well, what would you like? 
[01:03:30]  He said, I'd like to have a dollar and a half  for every inch of meat  between the tip of my private and my balls.  The president said,  I say that to say this.  You can have it.  A dollar and a half for every inch.  He said, doctor, would you come over here  and measure this man?  Doctor walked over and said,  one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.  He said, where are your balls?  He said, in South Vietnam. 
[01:04:00]  I don't want any of the adults here to look shocked  because you know I might do anything.  Television is not my forte.  I'm a nightclub performer.  Where adults gather.  A lot of chicks try to sit and look pure.  You know what I mean?  I hate my them bras, man.  Try to sit so goddamn angelic.  So pious and powerful. 
[01:04:30]  My God, did you hear him say shit?  Shit, yeah, you heard me say shit.  I'm 48.  I can say shit when I feel like it.  How old do you have to get  before you can say shit?  Shit.  Shit.  I'm 48.  I've been saying shit over 40 years.  I used to tell my mother  she used to cook that pack back and stuff.  I don't want that shit. 
[01:05:00]  It's everything 24-7.  XM.  202.  The O&A virus.  It's everything.  All the time.  Prepare to be wowed.  What?  Knockers.  Live them out Wednesday.  Okay, okay, fine.  Wow.  Our goal is to sex up 
[01:05:30]  the show today, Anthony.  Sex it up?  Yeah, we need to balance out  the program a little bit.  So we're patiently waiting  for a lady to do,  I don't know, something.  A guess what's in my pants?  A queef?  I think we want a queef today, right?  Yeah, we want a queef, man.  All right, let out some air, girls.  Give us a call with your queefs.  Love it.  Or maybe a couple  trying to take down Illinois.  Illinois is still the sexiest state  in America. 
[01:06:00]  The home state of Obama!  Illinois is reporting in  as the sexiest state.  Still, yeah.  With all precincts reporting.  Yeah.  With all stains analyzed,  yes, they are the sexiest state  in America.  Chicago.  Speaking of Illinois, Anthony,  we made the Chicago Sun-Times  yesterday.  Oh!  Big, huge article.  Another big, huge article  about your pals.  After all, we are the pioneers  of satellite radio.  Yes, we are.  They are calling us  the pioneers. 
[01:06:30]  In the covered wagon,  taking the family out  to the frontier.  That's what we're doing.  Well, that's why I want to read  a little bit of this  because you were joking  the other day  that every article  we had the same quotes.  Same quotes.  I was using the,  you know, people were asking,  well, what are you going to do  to top the sex  in St. Pat's thing?  And I said, I don't know,  sex for Allah?  Yeah.  Or sex in a mosque?  We used that  in about 10 articles.  And then they asked us  what we did  during our two-year hiatus. 
[01:07:00]  And I said,  I played golf  with old people.  Yeah.  Over and over again,  that made the articles.  And then you like  to use the old,  you don't go to CNN  for dick jokes,  why would you come  to the Opie and Anthony  show for news?  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha.  That's hysterical.  Although I think  we did a fine job  with the news today  in the first hour  of the program.  So the Chicago Sun-Times  wrote a little article  on satellite radio.  I just want to read  our parts.  It's a long, long article.  I don't want to bore you guys  because people said  that you guys should read  less on the new program. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  We can't help it  that we're getting  a lot of this press.  That's kind of cool, right?  Sure.  All right.  Well, the headline,  when the FCC gags  come off, Anthony.  On Monday, October 4th,  frat boyish radio duo.  Frat boyish?  What, are we paddling  each other?  We haven't heard  that one yet.  I wish.  These guys all come up  with the craziest ways  to describe us.  Frat boyish.  My favorite is...  We're doing keg stands  here in the studio,  raping girls.  Trains. 
[01:08:00]  Ah, trains.  Not that I would know  anything about training  a girl.  But anyway,  my favorite is when  we were in Sync Magazine.  And I was called  the pumpkin-headed...  Pumpkin-headed.  Yeah, what was that?  Was it pumpkin-headed?  Pumpkin-headed.  Opie, the pumpkin-headed what?  What was the other adjective?  Yeah, give it...  There it is.  Pumpkin-headed.  The latest issue  of Sync Magazine.  We're in pretty much  the last page  of the magazine.  That sounds like an insult.  It says...  Pumpkin. 
[01:08:30]  Maybe the color of your hair  he was trying to go for.  Well, it's strawberry blonde.  Hughes,  the pumpkin-headed half.  That's what it was.  The pumpkin-headed half  of XM Satellite Radio  is the Opie and Anthony show.  That's my favorite  description so far.  Yeah.  So anyway,  the Chicago Sun-Times  on Monday, October 4th,  frat boyish radio duo  Greg Hughes  and Anthony Cumia,  a.k.a.  Opie and Anthony,  opened their show  with comedian George Carlin's  infamous monologue,  Filthy Words.  Why?  For symbolic reasons, 
[01:09:00]  partly,  but also because  at long last  they could, Anthony.  Yes.  Hired at  Federally Unrestricted  Satellite Network  XM Radio  nearly two years  after their  much-publicized  2002  sacking by  Infinity Broadcasting  after a segment  featuring descriptions  of a couple having sex  in New York St. Pat's Cathedral,  a bit that drew  a hefty  $357,500 fine  from the FCC.  By the way,  we have not paid  that fine yet,  and I don't think  we ever will.  The jocks no longer 
[01:09:30]  must contend  with loosely defined  regulations involving  broadcast decency.  And it's a lot of babble,  and then over here  it's Anthony commenting,  it's all about being able  to discuss sometimes  adult subject matter  plain and clear,  Cumia says,  without having to go  through all the ritual  that you would have to go  through on traditional  broadcast radio  just to make the point,  which is so true.  Yes, it is.  Just to get the conversation  started,  to get people up to speed  as to what you're talking about.  We wasted so much time 
[01:10:00]  speaking in code  just so we could  say the word fuck.  Yeah.  The first day or two,  I think both of us  kind of found ourselves  cursing a little bit  more than we probably  would have  because it was like,  oh wow,  look how cool this is,  you said.  But you know what?  It got old really fast  and we started a rule  on our show,  don't curse just to curse.  If it comes out  like we're just talking  off the air,  then let's do it.  But we still find ourselves  kind of editing ourselves  and using initials  instead of curse words  and still using  a lot of the code words  that we invented.  Who, who, who.  Euphemism, after all,  can be far funnier 
[01:10:30]  than X-rated bluntness.  The raw stylings  of Carl and Richard Pryor  and a handful of other  bawdy bards  notwithstanding.  For one,  it's less  bawdy bards.  Linguistically lazy.  It's not a quote from you,  right?  No, no, no, no.  This is the,  no.  I'm going to walk off  this radio show.  What, you don't like  the word bawdy?  A bawdy bard.  What is a bawdy bard?  I don't know.  It's a bawdy bard.  Bawdy is like a racy.  Yeah.  I don't know what a bard is.  It's a bard.  The immortal bard  is Shakespeare.  For one,  it's less than.  So a bard would be, 
[01:11:00]  what is the definition  of bard?  I don't know.  Someone help us out.  Just send it on  the instant feedback.  For one,  it's less linguistically lazy.  Also,  it's less in your face  and more easily digested.  Unlike most TV,  It's an entertainer.  Unlike most TV,  radio by its very nature  engages the mind,  says Inside Radio editor  Tom Taylor.  They love talking to this guy  Tom Taylor all the time.  Any kind of audio storytelling  requires some kind of activity,  some kind of participation  on your part.  If there's a definitive line  to be crossed  in satellite land, 
[01:11:30]  Kumi and Hughes  have yet to find it.  And they're not sure  they will.  As ever,  professional instinct  and what Hughes terms  the laws of humanity,  that's your line.  You've been using  the laws of humanity.  That was my line.  That's the only thing,  the only barrier  we have on this program  is the laws of humanity.  We can say whatever we want.  We can talk about  whatever subject matter we want.  We just can't,  you know,  do something like  a Lacey Peterson  or something  as a little promotion.  The laws of humanity  steer them on  a case-by-case basis. 
[01:12:00]  Live radio, man.  It's second-by-second,  Kumia says.  Yeah, man.  And you have to make  these decisions.  Cool, man.  Live radio, man.  We're taking on  the man, man.  Yeah, man.  Let me tell you,  it's groovy, man.  Body bard, man.  I'm a body bard.  Yes, Steve.  A body bard.  Oh, yes, Steve.  Thank you.  Here we go.  Thirteen entries  found for bard.  First one.  One of an ancient  Celtic order of minstrel. 
[01:12:30]  Sorry.  Wait, hold on.  Sorry.  Of course,  we've got to wait.  It's your music.  Does it say  what you are  from most establishments  after three drinks?  Wow.  And don't dare  enter the studio  before your freaking music.  You know the rules.  You're right.  You're right.  You've got theme music  and everything.  Let's take advantage of it.  Why is body bard  eating a jelly donut?  That hair better  grow back fast, man.  It's coming.  All right.  Okay.  That's what Stalker Patty  said, too,  and it took like  a year and a half, 
[01:13:00]  by the way.  This will be back  in two weeks.  Body bard.  42.  Weeks.  All right.  Two weeks.  Wow.  All right.  One of an ancient  Celtic order of  minstrel poets  who composed  and recited verses  celebrating the  legendary exploits  of chieftains and heroes.  Yeah.  Or a poet,  especially a lyric poet.  I knew what a bard  was from EverQuest.  You could be a bard.  You knew the whole time?  Well, I knew it was  some type of entertainer,  but I didn't know  what the definition was. 
[01:13:30]  I wasn't able to  define it as eloquently  as Steve did.  You wanted to  dumb down to our audience.  You knew what  a bard was the whole time.  A little bit.  It's also a piece of  armor used to protect  or ornament a horse.  A bard?  Yes.  Yeah, how about that?  A lot of equestrian  references here,  but it's primarily  an entertainer.  All right.  All right.  Thanks, Steve.  You're welcome.  And there he goes.  Martini Steve, everyone.  Yeah, big martini glass  in hand  with that huge olive in it  just swishing itself around.  All right. 
[01:14:00]  We're just about done.  This was in the  Chicago Sun-Times yesterday.  Live radio, man.  Yeah, man.  Let me tell you.  Fuck the establishment, man.  Live radio, man.  Yeah, man.  Oh, stop.  Did you really say man?  I'm a dick.  I probably did.  Because I'm usually  the one that goes dude a lot.  But man.  I've never heard you say man.  Live radio, man.  Oh, what an ass.  What a complete ass I am. 
[01:14:30]  Man.  Man.  Like I'm telling you.  Look, I don't need you, man.  What a dope.  Opie and Anthony say,  we're not going to take it.  Yeah, man.  Dude, it's live radio, man.  Let your freak flag fly, man.  Yeah.  Oh, what an ass.  I will never say man  in another interview.  Well, take off the tie-dye shirt  and then we will believe you.  Oh, come on, man.  You're looking like a hippie  all of a sudden over there. 
[01:15:00]  Jesus.  Live radio, man.  It's second by second.  I can't get past that.  I'm a dick.  Wait to hear what I said.  Live radio, man.  Man.  It's second by second,  Cumia says,  and you have to make  these decisions  between what you think  is going to be  really good radio  and what might get your ass  thrown off the air.  At this point,  says Hughes,  we're just doing our show  and figuring it out 
[01:15:30]  as we go.  We describe it  as the wild, wild west.  We're out there  kind of killing the buffaloes  and exterminating the Indians  with smallpox blankets  and trying to find  our territory.  Now, I understand  our need for analogy  in some of these interviews  and we've come up  with quite a few  but that is one  I don't even know  where you were going  with that one.  What was that?  Could you say that again, please?  Listen to this analogy.  This article ends, okay?  At this point,  says Hughes,  we're just doing our show 
[01:16:00]  and figuring it out  as we go.  We describe it  as the wild, wild west.  Right.  Okay?  That's what we described  the internet  when it first came out.  The wild, wild west.  The wild, wild west.  Everything was up for grabs, right?  And then I say,  we're out there  kind of killing the buffaloes  and exterminating the Indians  with smallpox blankets  and trying to find  our territory.  We're in a western here  on XM Satellite Radio.  We're in a western. 
[01:16:30]  We're shooting Indians, man.  Draw, man.  Smoking a peace pipe, man.  Watch it, man.  There's some red dudes  up on that hill, man.  Oh, quite a mean analogy.  Isn't that?  Well, we're just gathering up  blacks and enslaving them  to do our labor  just to kind of see  how much we've won.  Just take an American atrocity  and spin it  so it's us having  a fun radio show.  Yeah, sure. 
[01:17:00]  We're just gathering up  six million of them  in the Warsaw ghettos  and throwing them  into the showers  that have gas coming out  just to find our footing.  You know, we walk  in the studio every day  like they walked them  into the gas chamber.  You know, I look up  at the sprinkler systems  like they would look up  at the Zyklon B  coming and falling down  on their heads.  And when the laughs come,  we're like,  it's only water.  Right.  What an analogy.  I'm going to use that  for a few more articles  though, I think.  I'm going to go with  that one for a while. 
[01:17:30]  With the western?  Yeah, the western thing.  It's just poison blankets  for the Indians.  We walk into the studio  like the Yates children.  I mean, are we going  to have fun?  Or are we going to be  drowned by our mother?  We just don't know  until the show's...  Oh, God.  You had to take it there again.  I can't help it.  I'm obsessed with her.  All right.  Every day, each one of us  goes through the horror,  I think, of having  their own head chopped off.  You know?  It's the horror of  coming up with a good bit  or something as important  as that.  My God, Opie. 
[01:18:00]  It's an American tragedy.  This radio show  is an American tragedy.  Smallpox.  Smallpox.  Was that ever really done?  Oh, yeah, it was.  We were the first terrorists.  Who are you kidding?  It's like germ warfare.  Michael Moore told me.  We were the first terrorists.  Oh, then it's got to be true.  Good job, Michael.  Michael Moore, great job.  Great job on the election.  Swayed that American vote.  Swayed that American vote.  Time to go back  to being a nobody.  Roger me.  Not only did Bush win,  but how many seats  were lost in the House  and Senate? 
[01:18:30]  Like 20?  The Democrats got  nothing accomplished.  Nothing.  They lost ground.  With his big push  from the celebrities  and Michael Moore.  Good job.  And Howie over there  and Springsteen singing  with his pals  and Puffy pretty much  threatening people  that he was going to  shoot them if they didn't vote.  None of that shit worked.  Good job.  Smug, paternalistic,  condescending,  liberal idiots  and you're losing ground  every day.  Stop being so smug.  Pat Philbin  from Munaki  checking in, Opie. 
[01:19:00]  saying about my quote,  Ant sounds like  his best friend  got shot at Kent State.  Yeah, man!  See, when these guys  get a little quicker  in the other booth there,  they could have  thrown on Ohio.  What an ass.  You sure you don't have  a Kent State analogy  about the radio show?  I was thinking about it.  You know, it's just like  people being shot  by the National Guard  when we walk in here.  There's a potential  that we're going to be  shot down by headphones  that don't work  or some kind of sound effect  that wasn't triggered 
[01:19:30]  in time.  Man!  All we want to do  is go to class.  Right!  That's all we're looking  to do.  That's all we're trying  to do and it's exactly  like that.  It's like being a Red Sox fan.  I mean, are we going  to have fun and celebrate  or take a pellet gun  in the eye?  We just don't know.  Who knows?  I was proud of that one.  Yeah, man.  I stayed up all night  thinking of that one.  Speaking of the Wild Wild West,  this is just a quickie,  but Canada Kimo Sabe ruling  has a high-ho silver lining.  Oh, my God.  You ever read Canada news, 
[01:20:00]  Canadian news?  It is the most boring  nothing-ever-happens-up-there news.  Do they have murders and rapes?  Oh, yeah, the Bernardos.  Paul and Carla.  Paul Bernardo, Carla Homolka,  my favorite couple.  Oh, I think I read about them.  Paul Bernardo,  who was originally  the Scarborough rapist,  and then he and his wife,  Carla, kidnapped.  Unfortunately,  they were 15-year-old girls.  I mean, they were young,  but they raped them  and it was awful.  Canadians?  Yeah, from Toronto.  And Paul actually was  married to this woman 
[01:20:30]  and he had a thing  for her 15-year-old sister.  So the woman drugged her  and then had lesbian sex  with her own young sister  while Paul had sex with her  and the girl inadvertently  died from the drugs  they gave her.  Inadvertently, yeah.  Well, they didn't mean  to kill her.  Right.  Well, they didn't.  Well, after that,  he used to make his wife  dress up like the kid's sister  who had died  and say,  my name is Tammy  while he effed her.  Oh, jeez.  Wow.  Okay.  Well, I stand corrected, man.  We give Canada  a little more respect today.  So, Canada,  you're a bunch of boars,  but when you go off the deep end,  boy, do you. 
[01:21:00]  Paul in Texas.  Hey, Paul.  Good morning, guys.  Congratulations.  Congratulations on...  Your man is back in.  Oh, yes, sir.  I know it.  I agree.  I agree.  This is kind of like  the day we had to congratulate  all the Boston Red Sox.  Massachusetts had to be congratulated.  We're going to congratulate  all the Red States today.  Congratulations, Paul.  Well, I'm going to say  two quick things  and I'm going to get out of the way.  Listen, Jim,  I've got a question  for you right quick.  Sure.  Are you a friend of Bill Wilson? 
[01:21:30]  Yes, I am.  Right on.  Me too, brother.  Cool, man.  Who's that?  Just a guy we know.  Is that a cult?  Some guy from Jersey.  Yeah.  Is that a high sign?  Yeah.  Wow, this is great radio.  Thank you, man.  I don't know if you guys knew this,  but did you know that you're also  in Fortune Magazine this month?  Yeah, we're making all the articles.  There's a really bad picture of us  in the latest issue of Fortune Magazine.  And to a man,  and only such a man,  would I leave my fortune.  Bob Rich, get the bag, Norton. 
[01:22:00]  Get the bag.  Bear with me on this one, guys.  Bear with me on this one,  because I don't keep up with Howard Stern.  I did not realize  he was getting paid that much money,  but I also didn't know  that Sirius lost $137 million last year.  The little doggy company's in deep shit  is what it comes down to,  and they're making a desperate move  by hiring Howie,  and Howie made an awful decision.  Between the two companies, 
[01:22:30]  XM is far superior,  and we're going to win in the end.  It's simple as that.  They just don't have the technology.  They don't have the programming.  They don't have enough radios in stock.  They don't have buckets.  The production's way behind.  Howie and his stupid ego  got the best of them,  and he should have probably  listened to his handlers  and his people,  because it's not even close.  I mean, XM Satellite Radio  is the better company.  It's simple as that.  They say it on Wall Street.  I mean, whatever. 
[01:23:00]  Good luck to them.  If they paid me $500 million,  there's probably much  that I would not do.  Yeah.  Yeah, there you have it.  One half a billion.  You guys are doing a good job, man.  I appreciate it.  I keep up the good work.  Thanks, man.  Thanks, Paul.  So, yeah, let's get back  to this Canadian story  about Kimo Sabe, Anthony.  A ruling came down  yesterday in Ottawa.  The courts have ruled  Kimo Sabe is not a racist term,  at least in Canada.  Kimo Sabe.  That's what the Lone Ranger  used to call Tonto.  There's going to come a time 
[01:23:30]  we're not going to be able  to make fun of anyone anymore.  Doesn't that mean, like,  my friend or something?  That's the left.  In Injun?  Steve, look up Kimo Sabe.  Kimo Sabe is technically  a friend.  We need the definition  of Kimo Sabe.  Well, squaw is, like,  I know of slang  for female genitalia.  I thought it was just  for the whole woman.  Not the woman's whole.  Get it?  No, I thought it was  for, you know,  the entire Indian woman  was a squaw.  Well, yeah, it means, like...  I know it's derogatory.  Yeah, like twat or whatever. 
[01:24:00]  Really?  Something vicious, yeah.  I heard Indian...  Nice.  Yeah.  Yeah, they don't like  being called that.  No, a little squaw.  There was a time  before casinos  were being built and stuff,  and the Indians  kind of got some respect  through the casinos  that they're building  that, yeah,  they were really, like,  crapped on in the country.  I think they still are,  but not as badly  as they used to be.  And to call  an Indian woman  a squaw  was just really bad.  Really bad.  I don't like  political correctness,  but I do agree with them.  Like, teams like the Redskins... 
[01:24:30]  Like, I heard them explain,  like, in Redskins,  it was a term  they used to, like,  describe how many  Indian bodies  were piled up in a cart.  Like, how many Redskins  we got.  Are you kidding?  No, like, that's what that turns...  I thought because  they were out in the sun  all the time  because, you know,  and they would get  that kind of tan,  burned color,  and it was red.  They were the red people.  That may have been  where it originally started,  but then it came to be...  That's why they're  offended by it.  I don't believe that.  No, I heard Indians explain it.  I think that's PC stuff  that they came up with.  Maybe.  I think that's the story  they came up with, man.  I hate that PC crap,  especially with the sports team. 
[01:25:00]  Well, I just heard...  I don't like it either,  but I heard these American Indians  very, very graciously  explaining why it bugged them.  Yeah, the Redmen  had to change their name.  I don't...  In a way, it's like,  look, if you did it  with Jews or blacks  or gays,  let's say you wanted  to call a bunch of the fruits  and your symbol on the helmet  was just a swished hand.  That'd be great.  I would love it, too,  but, I mean,  the gays would complain  and they'd scream about it.  I don't know.  I think it's almost  paying homage to them  as great warriors and stuff.  You're not putting them  on the side of a garbage truck.  You're putting them  on the side of a team  that you want to be mighty.  But as far as political correctness, 
[01:25:30]  they just go way too far.  I mean, with the NBA...  Yes, they do.  You know, the Washington Bullets,  that was a great name  for that team.  Yeah.  And now it's  the Washington Wizards.  They had to change bullets  because it was violent.  Right.  There's a lot of bullets  in Washington.  There's not many wizards  in Washington.  What wizards?  What the hell  is a Washington wizard?  That is awful.  Bullets?  Who are you offending?  Huh?  Who are you offending  with bullets?  Their team used to be  the Washington Bullets.  Yeah.  Wow.  It had a cool logo 
[01:26:00]  and everything.  Wait, well...  I have no idea  what kimosabi means.  We'll get an answer,  I guess, soon.  As soon as I can figure this out.  And here comes Martini Steve  back into the studio.  Here's the definition  of kimosabi.  Yes, Steve?  It's a noun.  The definition is  a faithful friend,  has various meanings  in Native American language,  and it's used this way  primarily in the  Lone Ranger television show.  Lone Ranger.  But what does it mean?  Faithful friend.  Oh, faithful friend.  There you go.  All right.  So why is it, uh... 
[01:26:30]  Why was it even  being considered  as a racist?  Well, man,  if you let me read...  Well, okay,  read what the man wrote.  Where are you going, Steve?  Man.  Oh, there he goes.  Martini Steve.  There he goes.  He's not playing along.  Martini Steve.  We told him  he could only enter  and leave the studio  to his theme music.  All right, Ottawa.  The courts have ruled  Kimo Sabe  is not a racist term,  at least in Canada.  Judges took up the issue  after a native Canadian woman  complained that her boss  created a poison work environment. 
[01:27:00]  Here we go.  By calling her Kimo Sabe,  the name given to the Lone Ranger  by his friend Tonto  in the 1950s TV western,  The Lone Ranger.  The manager of a second-hand sports store  in Sydney, Nova Scotia,  argued that Kimo Sabe  was a term he used  to address customers  as well as employees.  The court ruling last week  confirmed a decision  by a Nova Scotia  Human Rights Commission  Board of Inquiry.  That decision was made  after the board  spent a full shift  watching the Lone Ranger episodes.  That's how they decided  on this decision? 
[01:27:30]  Stupid camera.  Wow.  When asked what Kimo Sabe meant,  Tonto responded,  trusty friend.  The board found out  when they were watching  the TV show.  Both the Lone Ranger  and Tonto  treat one another  with respect.  At no time during the episodes  is the term Kimo Sabe  ever used in a demeaning  or derogatory manner.  You Kimo Sabe.  Get over here.  Oh.  Oh.  Look at who's quick  on the draw  with the Lone Ranger music.  Hug.  Sucked by Kimo Sabe. 
[01:28:00]  Oy.  The board added, however,  that while Tonto  was always treated respectfully,  the long popular TV show  treated other Native American  characters in a demeaning manner.  Of course.  Kimo Sabe would stand around  just watching his brother  Redskin be gunned down.  Yeah, but that's when  the sitcoms and TV watching  was a lot of fun.  You know, it wasn't a bunch  of stupid, like, you know,  friends getting together  in an apartment  and talking about, you know,  crap.  Hey, that's one of my  favorite shows.  That's right.  What would Chandler Bing say? 
[01:28:30]  Chandler Bing, man.  I'm sure something witty  and fun.  Oh.  Yeah, back in the old days  you could get away with that.  Like we were talking about  yesterday, stupid F Troop.  You ever watch that show?  It's just every bad  Indian stereotype.  They're drunk.  They're stupid.  They're selfish.  They sell out each other  for a buck.  And that was a sitcom.  Hogan's friggin' Heroes.  Stop it.  There's swastikas in a comedy.  There's swastikas in a sitcom. 
[01:29:00]  There you go.  You think you'd get away  with that stuff now?  No way.  The fun-loving Nazis?  Schultz!  There's the commandant figure.  You know how wacky  those commandants  at the POW camps used to be?  Ha ha!  Big Nazi-flex pictures  of Adolf Hitler  in a sitcom.  Yeah!  Yeah!  I loved it growing up as a kid.  It was fun stuff,  but you'd never get away  with it now  because people are too PC.  They'd rather, you know,  throw on some reality show.  That's all-inclusive. 
[01:29:30]  And they're losing  all over the country.  Yeah.  All over the country.  You politically correct  jizz bags, you are losing.  Nothing edgy.  Nothing fun.  Nope.  Nothing thought-provoking.  It's just, uh,  eat some bugs,  try to jump from this car  to another car.  Eh, it's dull.  Yeah, but the best reality show  is that, uh,  The Biggest Loser.  The Biggest Loser.  You get two teams of fatties.  Oh, is that the fatties?  Oh, my God.  Is that hilarious?  That's one of those gimmicky ones  that could last a season, maybe.  It's hilarious, though. 
[01:30:00]  They get all these fatties  and during the week  they have to try to lose weight  through exercise  and eating right and stuff.  And then on national TV  they put them on a scale  to see how much weight they lost  and they either all applaud  or go, oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  Do they taunt them with food?  Uh, yeah.  They pretty much, uh,  they put, like, platters of food  in front of them.  Like, you can eat whatever you want.  And the one episode I saw  they had a whole bunch of carrots.  Yeah.  And some other veggies  and then it was, like,  surrounded with ribs  and all sorts of fatty foods.  Ribs!  And this one guy  couldn't help himself  and he's just digging into the ribs. 
[01:30:30]  Nice.  That's the type of, uh,  programming I love watching.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm not into the, uh,  I haven't even kept track  of any of the reality shows  this season.  And they're right.  They're just dying.  They're, uh...  What about Swan?  They're low-rated.  Oh, God, I did watch one episode.  I just did the deaf girl one.  Swan is hilarious.  But now they're taking it  to another level.  They had two women on.  One was a big fatty  who lost a bunch of weight.  So she had hanging skin on her. 
[01:31:00]  It was, and really bad.  It was hanging real bad.  Uh, so, so they, uh,  they chopped the skin off,  gave her the facelift  because she had rubber face.  She couldn't even, uh,  she pulled her cheeks apart  and it was like rubber face.  But they did a pretty good job on her,  I must say.  But the, the, the,  the prize in this episode  was, a girl who had been deaf  since about three years old.  Uh, I, I'm very sad  because they used to call me Daffy.  How would she know? 
[01:31:30]  She has, like,  this minuscule hearing in one ear.  So they gave her  another different hearing issue.  They weren't saying Daffy to her.  They were saying Daffy.  Or Debbie.  I can hear her.  Her name's Debbie.  They call me Debbie.  Okay, Debbie,  stop calling me that.  Daffy.  Yeah.  Swan is the best show on TV.  And she was a mess.  Yeah.  And they kind of did her up  but she still kind of looked like  a little bit of a better mess.  Right.  And, uh, they picked her as the,  the winner.  She'll go on to the big pageant  at the end.  Whatever that is.  The footage is hilarious 
[01:32:00]  right after the surgery though.  Their lips and their faces  are all bent up.  They're all beat up.  No.  My favorite part is when they  stand in front of the curtain.  Yeah.  Go, okay,  tell us when you're ready.  We'll pull the curtain  and you can see yourself  in the mirror.  And they have a camera  behind the mirror  so you catch the girl's reaction.  And she goes,  okay, I'm ready.  And the curtain opens up.  She goes,  and they all do this.  They go,  oh,  I'm beautiful.  Yeah.  Oh, it's awful.  You're not.  It's awfully funny. 
[01:32:30]  I love it.  I love it.  Yeah.  It's a nightmare.  Do they actually cut the skin  off the fat chick  or do they just  mush it onto her back  and scrunchy it  for the rest of the episodes?  All right,  don't turn around.  Tie it in a knot.  They should get  a really hot girl  and make her really ugly.  Oh, there's a little twist.  Do that show.  Why not?  Do that show.  I'm hammering battery acid  Tuesdays on CBS.  But there's no real fun sitcoms.  There's nothing that's edgy  or, you know,  like All in the Family was  when I first started.  Oh, my God. 
[01:33:00]  Sanford and Son.  Sanford and Son's another one.  You just never see  anything like that anymore.  No one's willing  to take any chance.  People think Will and Grace  is like,  ooh,  with the stereotypical  homo humor.  No.  The left has done nothing  in the last 20 years  but try to stifle free speech.  Yeah.  As long as it jives  with their political ideology,  then you can have free speech.  But if it's anything  that's anti-woman,  anti-race,  anti-gay,  it's not accepted on TV.  That's the bottom line.  The left,  you're awful. 
[01:33:30]  You can't make fun  of obvious stereotypes.  You can't joke about race.  You can't joke about  sexual orientation.  Or people get all mad at you.  Unless you're black.  If you're black,  you can do it  because paternalistic,  bleeding-heart liberals  who feel that blacks  are children  and need to be coddled  allow them a certain amount  of language freedom  because they figure  that's how you treat a child.  What did Jay-Z call R. Kelly?  A monkey, I think.  Called him a monkey.  Called him a monkey.  Said you won't see that monkey  on this stage.  They replaced him.  They got a bunch of other acts.  What, Snoop Dogg up there 
[01:34:00]  with him now?  Or something?  Yeah.  They replaced him.  And called him a monkey.  That's a derogatory term  that if a white guy  ever used that term,  I mean,  you're hung out to dry.  It's a career ender.  Cosell.  Howard Cosell.  Look at that little monkey run.  Dude, after GTA San Andreas  is out for a year,  we're all going to be allowed  to say the N-word freely.  Do you think so?  Oh, my God.  It's going to be commonplace?  Oh, my God.  Have you been playing GTA?  Opie, you try saying it out 
[01:34:30]  in the open, then.  You go out there  and go play there.  Get a pickup game going.  It's okay if you're saying  the N-I-G-G-A.  Oh, it is?  Oh, yeah.  Okay, go ahead and say,  pass me the ball, nigga,  and see what happens to you.  Well, I told that story already.  Do I have to tell it again?  Just follow up with Cheddar.  Yeah.  You've heard that story, right?  No.  Really fast?  Oh, okay.  This really happened to me, actually.  I was really good  at basketball growing up.  A little skinny white kid  out on Long Island.  He's going to be one of the homeboys. 
[01:35:00]  I thought it was going to be  the next Larry Bird,  but I never grew.  No, I was really good.  I'm serious.  No, I know.  And I used to play  with all the brothers and stuff,  you know, the Shwoogies,  and I took on their culture  a little bit.  We went to basketball camp  every summer, you know,  and I would hang  in their neighborhoods  and listen to, you know,  to some, not really rap music.  I was doing it.  Earth, Wind, and Fire?  No, I was doing  my Zeppelin and stuff, but...  Earth, Wind, and Fire,  and Little Brother.  But I had this friend, Gary,  who was a light-skinned black, 
[01:35:30]  and we would play  a lot of pickup games,  you know, during the off-season.  I've told this story  a million times,  but it's the God's honest truth.  It was the first time  I ever said the N-word, okay?  So I was feeling comfortable  hanging out with the brothers.  Really comfortable,  because, you know,  we were at each other's houses.  I'm playing hoops with them.  We're traveling together,  going to basketball camp.  You get it, all right?  I'm feeling it, okay?  And we're playing  this pickup game,  and every time  one of the brothers scored,  they're like,  nice shot, nigga, nice shot,  you know, and all that crap, right?  So my buddy Gary  hits a three-pointer, 
[01:36:00]  and I turn to him  as we're running back  down the court,  and I go,  nice shot, nigger.  But I said it like, you know,  like a brother would, right?  I didn't even actually  officially say the whole word  before I was knocked out cold  on the basketball court.  Of course you were,  you dolt.  Who knocked you out?  He did.  He did.  And he was my friend.  Yeah, sure.  Why didn't he just explain to you  that that wouldn't be appropriate?  He did.  He explained it perfectly.  He explained it very appropriately.  But we, yeah,  we turn around  after he made the shot,  you know,  and I'm thinking  I'm just one of the guys now. 
[01:36:30]  I'm not thinking skin color.  I'm like, well, man,  I've been hanging with you guys  for a while.  I think it's time  we take this relationship  to the next level.  You are to the next level.  A punch in the face.  So I turned on  and I started to say,  yeah, nice shot.  You know,  I probably got the whole word out.  I'm exaggerating a little bit,  but I mean,  I was literally knocked out.  Did you end it with an A  or an E-R?  Back then,  I think it was A-Z.  Oh.  No.  That would be a bunch of them.  Did you say it nicely  or did you sound like  Nicholson in The Shining?  Nice shot,  nigger.  Nigger.  No,  it was nice. 
[01:37:00]  Nice shot.  It was nice.  Your son is attempting  to bring an outside forward  into this situation.  Hey,  did that end  your friendship with him?  Yeah,  that was the day  I gave up basketball  and I bought a skateboard.  Yeah,  skateboarding is safe.  You dope.  What made you think  you could do that?  I don't know, man.  That is a true story.  That's one of the classic  Topey stories.  Hard, dude.  I was out.  Out.  You woke up  and were they still playing?  They were just kind of, 
[01:37:30]  I don't remember.  to be honest with you.  They were like kind of,  maybe the other white guys  helped me up or something.  I don't know.  When I lived in the predominantly  black neighborhood  of Central Islip,  I avoided words like  Nichols and Knickers  just to be safe.  Just to be so.  Nothing was overheard  erroneously.  Swamp Junk Dave  from Long Island writes,  Is that Freedom Rock, man?  Well, turn it up, man.  Let's see what the quote is. 
[01:38:00]  One Monkey Don't Stop No Show,  said the rapper  who plans to complete  the ill-starred tour  now titled  Jay-Z and Friends.  One Monkey Don't Stop No Show.  There you go.  All right.  Yeah, what?  Oh, you finally killed it?  Good.  Oh, boy, did I.  Fly guts.  Thank you.  It's nice.  Oh, we lost George.  Okay, why don't we take a break?  Oh, you want to try to play  Stoner Spelling Bee today?  Yeah, man.  Do we got guys standing by 
[01:38:30]  to smoke some dope?  Do we have enough time?  Yeah, we just got to call them all.  We'll get a bunch of people  ready to go.  Get us, how many do you want?  Three, four?  Four would do.  Four.  Let's go with four stoners, okay?  Four stoners, man.  Try to find four stoners  that are smoking pot right now.  Also, we're looking for a girl  to sex up the show.  I'm telling you, man.  When Ant and I go home  and we talk about the show,  it's all about balance  and we're noticing  the sex has drastically dropped  on the show  since last Friday.  Sex it up.  We've got to sex it up.  We need a girl to do a queef.  We'll even accept  a what's in my pants. 
[01:39:00]  But we really would love  to get a couple  to try to take out Illinois  as the sexiest state in America.  Sure, give it a whirl.  Okay, as we go to break here,  Anthony,  let's check out the FU line  and see what's going on.  The very worst  of the Opie and Anthony  FU line.  This is Jermaine from New York.  I honestly leave a big F  to XM radio.  I'm in the car  for an hour a day  and I hear the same  effing part of the show  on the way home  and the way back  and it pisses me off.  I want to send a big fat  fuck you to Boston. 
[01:39:30]  Fuck you, Boston.  Yeah, I want to say  fuck you to the son of a bitch  in the department store  who told me not to buy  Grand Theft Auto  San Andreas  because it's wrong  and immoral.  Fuck you,  you jag-off.  Fuck all the y'all.  Call the Opie and Anthony  FU line  at 1-866-FU-RIME-1.  1-866-FU-RIME-1.  Well, fuck you very much.  It was Whip'em Out Wednesday  so I flashed some guy  on the Long Island Expressway.  He was involved  in a seven-car pileup. 
[01:40:00]  There was blood  and carnage everywhere.  But my tits looked great.  Please,  wow responsibly.  A public service announcement  of the Opie and Anthony show.  You know, honey,  I knew it was hot and sunny  before I even got out of bed today.  Ask me why.  Say it.  Say why.  Repeat after me.  Why?  Because my balls  were hanging low.  Let's say that real tight. 
[01:40:30]  We're talking rainstorm.  Half-masked, cloudy  with a chance of showers.  That's right, honey.  The penis sinks for itself.  It's got its own brain.  Why do you think  the head's bigger than the rest?  I can prove  it's got a mind of its own.  You ever get up in the morning  and he's already awake?  He's dressed.  He's ready to go, right?  He's in the kitchen  making fucking flapjacks.  You're in bed going,  come on, Joey.  Five more minutes. 
[01:41:00]  Your penis is going,  take me shopping.  I need a new hat.  But you remember  when they first came out  with the hard-on, huh?  Third, fourth grade,  you're leaning over  like the hunchback  of Notre Dame.  Teacher calls you up  to the board  and you're like,  I don't think so, honey.  You're the teacher.  You figure it out, all right?  I got some kind of ligament  over here.  I don't know  what's going on.  This thing is like alien.  It's drilling into  the desk next to me.  Call a cop. 
[01:41:30]  Maybe he'll throw  a donut around.  But you grow up,  you learn to accept  the hard-on  to deal with it.  Accept the P-hard-on,  you know?  That's God's joke.  You get up,  you're late for work,  you gotta take a squirt  and Joey's admiring  the chandelier.  You gotta stand there  like a moron  and talk him down.  Come on, Joey,  I dig you.  We'll dot I's  and cross T's later.  Work with me.  Yeah, the morning hard-on. 
[01:42:00]  I'll put that up  against that  Ginsu knife any day.  It'll slice,  it'll dice,  it'll pump your car up  if you got a flat tire.  See what I'm saying,  Cal?  Heather.

The singer in question  was Robert Plant.  The remarkable thing  about my arriving  at Pater's house  was A,  that I'd been staying  the week before  with Terry Reid  and his parents.  Born in 1948  in Staffordshire,  Plant had left home  at 16 in order  to pursue his passion 
[01:43:30]  for singing.  Beautiful materials  flowing from the walls  and the howling wolf  incredible stereo  blaring out  and there I am  with an old  battered suitcase  going,  what-o, mate?  Fellas,  have you heard of you?  We gotta run out  of this back in town.  Top trucks,  XM 46.  XM's Art Confidential.  Smart radio.  Restricted for your air zone.  Artists Confidential.

So I figured,  hey, I'll show him  some real melons.  Well, when I flashed him,  he lost his balance  and the entire stack of melons  came crashing down on him. 
[01:44:30]  He was suffocated  under two tons of melons.  But my melons  are still juicy and perky.  Please, wow responsibly.  A public service announcement  of the O.P. and Anthony show.  Oh, Jesus.  Obama.  Obama!  Looked like a Benetton ad.  on stage  when he was accepting.  Did you see that?  Looked like a Benetton ad. 
[01:45:00]  They were a bunch of  black people.  They were Asians.  Someone holding a baby  that wasn't the same color  as the person holding it.  That's inclusion.  There you go.  That's what America's  all about, Anthony.  It's about, no,  it's about those red states,  O.P.  It's about the red states.  Which really has nothing  to do with inclusion.  Those red states  could pretty much  take over the entire country.  They could just gobble up  the blue states,  no problem,  without even thinking.  Well, they tried that once.  It was called the Civil War.  Oh, good point.  That really didn't work out 
[01:45:30]  too well.  Good point, good point.  I think they got  a few more people now.  A lot of the country is there.  A little message  to Senator Kerry.  Well, we're waiting.  Yeah, come on.  Stop already.  It's over.  89% of African-American votes  went to Kerry.  11% to Bush.  Amazing.  Yeah, I'm surprised  that he got that much.  I know.  They're saying  the Latino voters  had a big say  in what happened.  They voted more for Bush  this election  than they did 
[01:46:00]  four years ago.  It kind of turned things around.  The Latinos  kind of blew it for Kerry.  Well, I'll bet you  that immigration stuff  and the fact that  he wanted license,  driver's license for,  remember he was pushing  for certain things  for illegal aliens  that were kind of annoying  a lot of his  hardcore Republicans.  Yeah.  All right.  One network will announce  that Bush is officially  the winner, by the way.  Not yet.  Bunch of pussies.  Keep milking it.  They just want to milk it  for people to watch.  Yeah, now it's just a matter  of keeping the viewers.  They got a thing going here.  What are they going to 
[01:46:30]  announce the winner  and go back to regular  programming that no one watches?  This is them milking it.  They had nothing else  planned today anyway.  How long after?  Kind of like this program.  Yeah.  I have some things  planned for this program.  I know.  We got a lot to do.  That was just a little joke.  Well, I don't want people  to hear that and not think  we have nothing.  Of course.  How long after shock and awe  did we sit there  and watch Baghdad  with nothing else happening  with the news going,  well, shock and awe,  I think it's going to start soon?  They love milking things like that  and they rope you in 
[01:47:00]  and you wind up hanging out  for the long haul.  Yeah.  Just announce it.  Bush is the winner.  He will be the president  for the next four years.  Kerry should step up  and concede defeat.  Give us that pathetic  concession speech  that I love so much.  No, no.  It's okay.  We must get our support  behind the president  and then Bush could come out  and I'm the president  for four more years  so go screw up.  That's pretty much  what he wants to say.  Yeah.  He wants to say tough shit. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, imagine how smug  he's going to look.  Oh, my God.  He's going to be smirking  and thumbs upping  and winking.  Yeah.  I'm your president again.  Four more years.  Smirks and thumbs up  all around.  Anthony, we've got to  break in here because  I'm back on cocaine.  Because our old  There's nothing you can do about it.  Because our old pal  Ozzy's on the line, Anthony.  Ozzy!  We haven't heard from Ozzy  on our new radio show.  Ozzy!  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Pretty good, Ozzy.  What's going on, man?  You know, I'm fucking crazy 
[01:48:00]  this morning.  I'm just trying to  see who's the new president.  I'm flipping through  five channels.  I didn't...  I asked my wife, finally,  who is the president.  I don't know what's going on,  you know.  Well, Ozzy, you know  it's going to be Bush again, right?  What the fuck are you  talking about, you know?  Well, you know,  I guess I'm glad  I pissed at the Alamo now, 
[01:48:30]  you know.  It's not...  I don't know, man.  That's what I was hearing,  but I wasn't positive  until, you know,  until I was...  Ozzy sounds like he's been up  watching the election coverage  all night.  Are you all right?  I'm...  I'm all right, you know.  What are you talking about?  He sounds like this  all the time.  I just...  I don't know.  I was just...  I guess I was hoping  for a different outcome,  you know.  Well, I think a lot of people  were hoping for a different outcome, 
[01:49:00]  but the Democrats  couldn't come up  with a better candidate.  I would say  just a little less  than half the country  was hoping for  a different outcome.  Yeah.  I would say...  I would say you're right,  you know.  Yeah.  It all came down  to Ohio there,  Ozzy.  Right.  I mean...  I'm not going to lie to you.  I'm not going to pretend  I know  what the fuck  you're talking about,  you know.  Yeah.  But, you know...  You're better at rocking  than talking about politics,  right? 
[01:49:30]  Sure.  You know,  I'm better  at taking the stage,  or at least I was,  you know.  No, you still do  a good job up there.  It's your wife  that we hate.  I hate it too much,  you know.  Yeah, let's be honest.  You just don't like  your wife, right?  But you have no choice  in the matter  because she could take you.  What the hell was that?  Was that a fart?  No, it was a chair.  It was off mic,  like,  your ass has to be  four feet away  from the microphone,  and I heard that  through my headphone. 
[01:50:00]  And that's just flying  around your silk boxes  right now.  It went like...  It was like a gangsta fart.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  See?  Meow.  I'm a fart  out of Jimmy's ass,  see?  I got a cigar  hanging out of my crack.  Meow.  Cheese it, guys.  The cops.  Meow.  If you listen to the replay  later today  and we're talking to Ozzy,  just listen.  You can hear it  in the background.  You can hear it  in the background.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Sorry, Oz.  Does that one smell?  No.  Oh, thank God.  Hey, Muggsy. 
[01:50:30]  Meow.  Ozzy.  Was that my little  cherub-faced comedian  farting in the background?  Yeah.  See, even Ozzy knows  how much Jimmy likes him.  Yeah, that was  old Jimmy Norton.  He likes to fart  in the morning there, Ozzy.  Something I'm sure  you like to do, right?  Sure.  Yeah, I like to do it  in bed.  It annoys the wife.  I was watching the PSAs  you guys put up.  What a great fucking,  you know, announcement. 
[01:51:00]  You know,  I wish I had videotape  running when I tried  to kill my wife,  you know.  Oh, you mean  she spilled my coffee?  Oh, she spilled my coffee.  Can we find that for Ozzy?  Please find it  because I want to hear it again.  No, we haven't played that  in a while.  That is my favorite clip  ever.  Of all time.  Phenomenal.  Yeah, it's a PSA  about what?  Domestic violence.  Yeah, there you go.  It ran in Ottawa, I think.  No, they wouldn't run  if they said it was too violent.  Oh, that's right.  It was too violent.  It was ready to run  and then they decided,  yeah, it was too violent.  I'm sorry. 
[01:51:30]  I think they also said  that showing her  be such a klutz  really kind of put  the empathy with the guy  because she did,  you know,  technically she spilled it.  Old Spiller Willard.  Ozzy, you want to imitate  that PSA for us?  Klutz?  Sure.  I would love to have,  you know,  my wife spill her coffee  and then in front of my children,  you know,  smack her around  and scold her with hot coffee.  Pour it over her tits, right?  You know, Ozzy,  you shake so much 
[01:52:00]  you don't even have to  pour the coffee over.  It'll just shake out of the...  Hold the coffee pot.  Yeah, hold the...  Splash all over  that lovely Sharon.  Even though it would probably  be my fault from shaking,  I wouldn't like to admit that  and I would spill it  all over her cunt, you know.  Jesus, Ozzy.  Why?  What's the matter?  Yeah, I forgot.  You can say that word now  on satellite radio.  Hey, Ozzy,  do you have any plans  on going to Sacramento  this weekend,  this Friday or Saturday? 
[01:52:30]  Oh, why would he go there?  Jim?  Why is my little Jimmy  doing a show out there?  Yeah, I'm doing a punchline  Friday and Saturday.  I thought maybe  you'd be out there  and you could come by the show.  Ozzy, do you think  you two ripped you off  when they sang  Sunday Bloody Sunday?  Norton is convinced  that you two  ripped your band off there.  I have to say this,  because I've been  listening to you guys  for a while.  I totally appreciate  the loyalty you have 
[01:53:00]  for me, Jimmy,  but I mean,  some of the things  I mean,  even I won't go with,  you know.  Of course,  I think what I write  is better, you know,  but I don't think  they ripped me off,  you know.  I think they did,  and I think actually  who wrote that song  was probably Geezer,  so I think that  Terry Butler  would be more inclined  to think that he was  going from it.  They can't find the PSA.  Are you kidding?  This is like the hottest bit.  That should be on my machine, 
[01:53:30]  as a matter of fact.  He lost the PSA.  Someone's going to have  to get hit.  You know,  I'll tell you what,  take off the Chandler clip  I have on my sound machine  and maybe put that PSA  on there.  That would be fun.  Oh, my God.  Is it missing?  I guarantee it's right there.  It's probably  in the last place you'll look.  Oh, my God.  That is great.  I just like watching Eric  and that frosted hair  bounce around the office.  She spilled my coffee.  He lost the CD.  He lost the CD. 
[01:54:00]  You got it?  You fucking bitch.  Steve's got it?  All right.  Well, Ozzy.  I have the PSA.  I had it put aside.  Ozzy, anything else?  Because we're going to do  stoner spelling,  but you should do  stoner spelling  be with us today.  You good at spelling?  I used to be, you know.  So, you know,  I'm not that great  at spelling anymore,  but whatever you guys want,  you know.  Probably shouldn't do drugs, though.  Probably not.  It's probably a good idea  to stay away 
[01:54:30]  or at least, you know,  cut back.  Yeah.  Now, Ozzy, tell the truth.  You want to be divorced  from your wife, right?  Absolutely.  I wasn't making  any bones about it  before.  I hate my fucking wife,  you know.  But she'll take you  for everything  if you leave.  I understand that.  She, um...  I really wouldn't have  too much of a leg  to stand on  in this divorce case,  you know.  She, I mean,  I'd say, you know,  half my money, 
[01:55:00]  I guess,  would go to her.  And she wears the pants  in the family.  She's in charge,  right, Ozzy?  For now,  for now,  yeah,  but, um,  I mean,  I,  sometimes I like  to kill her,  you know.  Right.  The only reason  I'm still working,  you know,  is because  she wants me to,  you know.  I haven't made  a decision for myself  in ten fucking years,  you know.  I know.  You wanted to retire  a long time ago,  but she keeps  propping you up  on that stage  year after year. 
[01:55:30]  Well,  whatever it gets,  whatever it gets  her diamonds,  you know.  All right.  Well, Ozzy,  thanks for checking in.  Anytime, guys.  You know,  I haven't,  I haven't gotten  my XM yet,  so I'm sorry  I destroyed  the flow of your show,  but, um,  you know,  I plan on getting it  soon,  and hopefully  I'll be a little  more topical  for you guys.  No worries.  Ozzy,  one more thing.  No,  not gonna work, guys.  Even after,  two years, man, 
[01:56:00]  you know,  you know,  good for you.  Damn it.  All right, Oz,  thank you.  Bye, guys.  See you, sweetie.  There he goes, Ozzy.  All right.  Stoner Spelling Bee,  which ones  are we gonna use,  Ben?  Are we gonna use  the bottom four,  PJ?  All right.  Hey, PJ.  Yeah.  Are you smoking pot yet?  Yeah, man,  I've been smoking.  All right.  I'm just trying  to see if he's  stoned enough.  Could you smoke  through the commercial break?  Definitely.  All right, keep smoking. 
[01:56:30]  We're gonna get to you.  We're gonna play  Stoner Spelling Bee  in a minute here.  That's PJ from D.C.  Brian,  where are you calling from?  Brian.  Oh, what's up?  Hey, what's up, bro?  Where are you calling from?  From Bridgewater,  New Jersey.  All right,  are you smoking dope today?  Definitely.  All right,  he sounds pretty stoned.  Yeah,  keep smoking  through the break,  all right?  Keep smoking  through the break.  We'll get to you.  All right,  there he goes,  Brian.  Brian,  give me a great shot.  That guy sounds good.  All right,  who else, Ben,  do you like here?  You like those four?  All right,  we got another guy 
[01:57:00]  from Jersey,  Steve.  Steve,  you're smoking dope?  Yeah.  All right,  can you smoke  through the break?  Sure.  All right,  we're gonna do  Stoner Spelling Bee  with Steve as well.  Sure.  And I think we got  Fat Mike from Louisiana.  Fat Mike.  What's up?  Oh,  Ozzy was just fucking funny.  That was great.  I don't know  if it was supposed  to be funny.  Fat Mike,  you smoking?  Yeah.  How you doing today?  Hi, Mike.  Hi.  Louisiana.  Love you guys. 
[01:57:30]  Glad to hear you back on.  You sound like  you're in a car,  though.  Yes,  I am.  I'm driving I-55.  I'm playing trucker  for a day.  And you're smoking dope?  Yep.  I don't think so.  You're out.  He's out.  Yeah,  I don't like the way  he sounded.  It didn't sound like  he was smoking dope.  I don't care if he's  driving and smoking dope,  but of course not.  Why would we care?  He wasn't convincing.  We mowed down a family.  Andy.  Andy.  Yeah.  Are you smoking dope?  Yeah,  man,  I haven't gone to bed  since the election. 
[01:58:00]  I've been up all night.  Because it's such an important  topic, right?  Exciting election coverage.  We all did,  like a bunch of us  did a bunch of blow,  and went up to  Rockefeller Center.  Democracy Plaza.  Democracy Plaza,  you nut.  You want one of those  lemmings behind the camera  there?  Nah,  nah,  I was like up by  where they had  the banner things.  Yeah.  All right.  You guys like Andy?  He kind of sounds all right  if he was a little more  stoned.  Yeah,  Andy,  smoke through the break. 
[01:58:30]  We'll check in with you,  okay?  I'll keep smoking.  Everyone playing this game  that's on hold right now  has to really smoke  a lot of pot.  Yeah.  We need you really stoned.  All right.  There'll be a little  controversy about my  friend's clip.  Yeah?  Somebody was saying  the clip I played  right before the Chandler  clip was a Ross clip.  So there's perhaps  two friend's clips on here?  Let me check.  You kissed a guy?  In my defense,  it was dark  and he was a very  pretty guy.  Now that's the Chandler clip.  Now this one. 
[01:59:00]  Whatever, dude.  You kissed a guy.  That's a Ross clip.  Yeah.  You put two friend's clips.  Because it sounded gay.  It certainly does sound gay.  That's why it was in the game.  But it's not good gay,  though.  It's like wacky sitcom gay.  Sitcom friends gay.  It's innocent gay.  Whatever, dude.  You kissed a guy.  That's funny.  Whatever, man.  You kissed a guy.  In my defense,  it was dark  and he was a very  pretty guy.  With the Chandler delivery?  Yeah.  He was a very 
[01:59:30]  pretty guy.  All right.  Both of them will be gone.  We'll put the PSAs  in the place.  That's perfect.  There you go.  There you go.  There's a man  thinking on his feet.  Marion.  That's a man thinking  on his knees.  One half of the  retarded Laverne Shirley,  the smarter half,  Marion.  Hi, Opie.  How are you doing?  He has to stand up  and think on his feet.  If he sat down,  he drowned.  Hi, Jim.  How's everybody?  Hello.  Hi, Marion.  How are you?  Good, good.  Hey, you guys sound  pretty good on satellite.  Thanks.  You finally got the satellite,  huh?  I just wish you guys  were on later 
[02:00:00]  because I'm usually  working this time of day  but I'm off  because I worked  the election yesterday.  You sound good, too,  if you had Bell's palsy.  Hey.  We are on later.  It was.  No, I mean, like, live  so I can come up  and visit.  You know, I'm usually,  like, at this time of day  at work.  People have been wondering  why we moved to mornings.  This is the reason.  Yeah, I know why.  These two can't come  and see us.  I guess I can come  and see us  on my days off  but today was sort of...  You were working  the election.  What were you doing?  I'm a board worker.  That's exactly what I'm doing. 
[02:00:30]  Were you voter intimidation?  Excuse me.  You walked by topless  to send blacks  back to their homes?  Stand by the voting booth  so people go,  I don't want to catch  whatever she has.  I lost a lot more weight.  She's always saying  she's losing weight.  I am.  Marion, no offense  but we see you  from time to time  at our gigs and stuff  and I just don't see  the losing weight thing.  No.  You say it every time  we see you.  I lost 60 pounds  at like three almost.  Two and a half years.  You should look like  Arthur Ashe by now.  And I'll see you guys  next Saturday  at the comedy thing 
[02:01:00]  at the...  Looking forward to it.  Marion, stop talking.  The Hammerstein Ballroom?  Yeah.  The Hammerstein Ballroom.  Whatever it is.  It's a passion of O&A  with Jim Norton,  Rich Voss,  and Jim Brewer.  All that's left by...  Hold on, Marion,  Marion, Marion,  all that's left  for that show  are single tickets  so if you guys want to go...  I already got tickets.  I got tickets.  I know,  but you'd have to buy two,  fat ass.  Hold on,  I'm trying to plug it.  We know you have tickets.  I'm saying for the public,  it is almost sold out.  There are only singles available  so if you want it...  I hear you guys call me.  Oh, for the love of God.  Oh my God, 
[02:01:30]  shut up for a second.  I'm allowing the public  to know  because people keep  emailing me going,  dude, you're sold out.  I'm not emailing you.  Shut up!  I said people.  You listened for a second.  I said people.  I didn't say hippopotamuses  are emailing me.  God.  With mullets.  Hey.  People,  aside from Marion,  if you're trying to get tickets,  go to Ticketmaster.  It's not sold out.  There are probably  100 tickets left,  but they're all singles  so if you want to go,  get singles.  Hey, I already...  Shut up!  I don't know if Diane's 
[02:02:00]  going with me.  Quiet.  What?  I don't know if Diane's  going with me.  Dude, we talked to her yesterday  and...  She doesn't have a pot  to piss and that's why.  We talked to her yesterday  and she has drunks  kind of sleeping over now, huh?  Well, that's her business.  She's a mess.  That's what I can tell you.  She's a mess.  Look, Marion's calling her a mess.  No, Marion, you know,  she's got her act together.  Yes, she really does.  I mean, Marion is a married woman.  Her and her husband  have a good job.  Nice house.  You got two houses, don't you?  No, I have one.  Oh, you sold the other one.  What about the beach house? 
[02:02:30]  That's only in the summertime.  Oh, see?  It's a little summer house.  Yeah, she's doing all right.  Anthony.  Diane's Nick.  Because I got satellite radio  and she can't get it  because she can't afford it.  I got the boon box, the sky box.  You got the what?  The sky box.  Before that, what'd you call it?  The boon box.  The boon box?  Oh, you got the boon box?  Yeah.  The coon box?  What are you talking about?  The boon box.  Wow.  The boon box.  Aaron or Bob,  you stupid fatso.  I'm also going to get the walkman.  But Daniel.  How did I miss that one? 
[02:03:00]  Holy shit.  Hey, I'm also going to get  the walkman.  A little tail hanging off the end of it.  Hey, but you guys sound really good.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Furry hat on your boon box.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  The boon box.  Lady Di's bringing drugs home  from the local bars.  Box is a boon to mankind.  Well, actually, this guy  that she's been hanging away,  she's known him for two years.  Oh, yeah?  But she can't get a job  because she can't keep a job  because she don't go to work.  Hey, do you ever go out to a club 
[02:03:30]  and sing,  boon, boon, boon,  let's go back to my room?  Yeah.  I just like that song,  matter of fact.  Yeah, but I hear you guys  called the rock yesterday  and woke her up.  What's your favorite  Eddie Murphy movie?  Is it Boon-a-rang?  Ass?  Boon-a-rang, Jim.  Marion, fill in the blank.  Sonic.  What?  Sonic Boom.  You guys doing pretty good, I hear. 
[02:04:00]  What unit did you buy, though?  I don't know what unit you bought.  You bought the Skybox?  I bought the Skybox  where I am going to have  the satellite built in.  What, you bought the Skybox?  Yes, $200.  She watches the show  from a Skybox.  I get to take it to the park.  What unit do you have, though?  I can walk around with it  and stuff.  Which one is that?  What's that called?  I don't even have that one.  It's a CD player.  No, what is the radio?  The box?  What's the radio? 
[02:04:30]  It's from Best Buy.  I hope a fire should consume you.  I was saying,  what kind of a box is it?  It's XM Skybox.  That's what it's called.  Oh, for the love of God.  If I could fling cancer on someone  with a Boon-a-rang,  I would Boon-a-rang cancer on you.  I could bring it to work  if I want to  with the people I work with.  What's it called?  What's it called?  So other people can get it.  Some kind of box.  It's XM Skybox.  That's exactly what it's called.  No, what kind of box is it?  What kind of radio?  It's an AM and FM CD radio built in. 
[02:05:00]  It begins with a B.  Yes.  Oh, I call it a Boon Box,  but it's really a Skybox.  It's got a CD player in it.  You call it a Boon Box,  and it's really a Skybox.  How can you be 0 for 2?  Jesus.  What's up, Jim?  Wow, Mary.  A Skybox.  You're priceless.  When are you coming to see us?  Hopefully before Thanksgiving  on my next day off.  See, next Wednesday,  I got jury duty for the first time.  Wow.  Really?  If I wasn't going to jury duty,  I'd probably come up and visit,  but if I'm off on Friday, 
[02:05:30]  I'm going to come up.  I believe you'll be off.  You'll be off.  Oh, you think any jury's  going to pick her?  Well, you know how it is  in the legal system.  I mean, business is booning.  They finally tracked me down,  you know,  and I never got called,  and now I get called.  Well, they ran out of people  to call, I think.  Yes, that's true.  Who did you vote for yesterday?  They ran in the old folk.  Who did you vote for yesterday?  I voted for John Curry.  John Curry.  I'm a Democrat.  Who did you vote for?  A Democrat, John Curry. 
[02:06:00]  And why?  Because I think Bush stinks  because of this stupid-ass war.  Okay.  His stupid-ass war.  Yes.  There you go.  You keep tabs on the news  to make sure you're updated  as to what's going on?  Well, I don't watch the news  every day because  when I come home from work,  I put you guys on.  The repeats of you guys.  All right.  How about Lady Di?  Did she vote?  She said she did,  but who knows if she did.  You think she's a liar,  don't you?  We live in different towns.  She voted for Budweiser tonight.  No, not me.  She's going to drink that.  Maybe she voted for Budweiser, 
[02:06:30]  but not me.  All right, Marion.  Okay, I hope to see you guys soon.  I want to know what she did.  Marion,  what did you actually do  for the election, though?  I sit here,  and I check names off,  and I ask people their names,  and I put their names in a book.  I saw some clips of the voting.  Let me tell you something.  Shut up a minute.  She got $200 for doing it.  She got $200.  I saw some clips of the voting last night,  and when they showed the polling places  and the table that people had to check in at,  it was people just like Marion  sitting at those tables. 
[02:07:00]  Yes, it was.  They were all races,  all creeds,  all sizes and shapes.  They were all you.  They were all you, though.  Let it be known.  And this is the only woman  calling our show today.  We stink.  You want to do a queef for us, Marion?  Oh, God.  You want to do a queef?  What's that?  You could probably do them  walking up the steps.  Hey, Jim, shut up.  You bald-headed freak.  No queef?  You don't want a queef?  No, what is that?  That's when you suck in air  into your genitals 
[02:07:30]  and blow it out,  and it makes a fart sound.  Oh, come on.  That's gross.  It's when your hot pocket  blows out a smelly,  odoriferous wind.  Hot pocket.  Hey, Jim, what are you guys doing now?  The Colin Quinn show  is going to be over with, I guess.  I know.  I shoot the last episode tomorrow.  Tomorrow?  Yeah.  Our season was supposed to end tomorrow,  but, you know,  why would you expect  a bunch of stupid liberals  to have to show this concern?  I was hoping to go on it  before it ended.  What, sweetie?  I was hoping to go there  before it ended,  but I didn't have time.  We'll go on Friday.  We're having a big party Friday.  What time? 
[02:08:00]  Noon.  No, actually, 6 p.m.  6 p.m., I'm sorry.  All right, I'll try to get a train over.  It's going to be a huge party.  Jon Stewart's coming.  Everybody's coming to it.  Yeah.  All right, I'll try to make it.  If not, I'll see you next Saturday.  I said come to the party on Friday.  All right, Marion.  It depends.  I'll see you guys next week, I hope.  All right, thank you.  Take care, guys.  Bye.  Marion, Marion.  What?  What do you think  is the most important thing?  I thought you wanted to get her.  I did.  You hung up on her?  I wanted to get her on a roll, though.  Get her on a roll.  Get her talking, and then hang up.  Well, I think my face is whack. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  I wanted to get her.  That's right.  What are you highlighting there, Ben?  That was almost just a hang up on Jimmy  in the middle of his sentence.  Okay, we got pretty much what happened there.  How did that backfire on me?  We got the...  Totally did.  We got the...  Skybox.  She spilled my coffee  as we go to break here, okay?  Oh, good.  Wait a minute.  You got to kind of set it up,  because I don't think people have heard this.  She dropped my boon box.  Yeah, a lot of people have turned on their radio  since we played this the first time.  The PSA that was denied airing in Canada  because it was too graphic and violent, 
[02:09:00]  it's a PSA against domestic violence,  and it shows some guy getting real violent  with a woman, just a random stranger,  in a public place.  And they say, you know,  you can't get away with this here.  How would you get away with it at home?  And you shouldn't get away with it at home.  And this guy is in a restaurant,  and a lovely waitress comes up to the table.  He's got his kids at the table with him,  and she's just pouring him a little coffee.  All right, let's take a listen.  Now, the video is up on OpieandAnthony.com.  Listen how he laughs when he says,  she spilled my coffee. 
[02:09:30]  She spilled my coffee.  I'm sorry, sir.  You fucking bitch.  How do you like that?  Stop it!  You wouldn't get away with it here.  You shouldn't get away with it at home.  I was walking down the street,  and some construction guy was shouting at me,  hey, show me your cans.  So I did.  And he plummeted 17 floors, 
[02:10:00]  and was impaled on a forklift.  But my tits looked great.  Please, wow responsibly.  A public service announcement  of the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, you need a driver there, buddy.  Who's this?  This is Jake calling about the job,  driving.  I saw it in the paper.  Yes.  Yeah, well, you still need a driver or what?  Did you fill out an application with us, Jake?  Pardon me?  Huh?  Speak up there.  What did you say?  You fill out an application with us?  No, no, no, no. 
[02:10:30]  Look, I saw it here in the paper,  and I'm calling you, fruitcake.  I'm looking for a job driving a truck.  We're looking for movers.  Yeah, well, that's what I do.  What class driver's license do you have?  I got five, one, two, three, four.  I got them all.  Yeah, class one?  Yeah, I drive buses, trucks.  I'll back a truck through the fucking two-family house garage.  One of those big two-ton trucks.  When was the last time you drove a truck to trailer?  Oh, jeez, what the fuck?  I say, about two weeks ago, I robbed one down in Jersey, 
[02:11:00]  and I drove it up here to New York.  Fucking flying.  Drove it through the tolls, no stopping, no nothing.  I'm good.  I say, why don't you call back on Monday?  Hey, I'll tell you what.  I come in, I'll take you for a test spin.  How's that?  We go out and we take the truck around the fucking block.  I speed, I pop wheelies.  I'm good, baby.  Go back on Monday, I'll talk.  All right, can I get you?  I want you.  You sound good.  You and me.  We make a team.  You drive with me.  All right.  What's your name again?  Jake. 
[02:11:30]  Jake, who did you work for, Jake?  Oh, jeez, I worked for Moish.  I worked for Mayflower.  You know?  Oh, yeah.  Hey, I was good with them, too.  You worked with Moishers?  Yeah, that's right.  When?  About, what, two years ago?  See, when I got a problem there,  they get fucking scared when I pop the wheelies and all that shit.  You know, I pop a lot of wheelies.  I'm good with that shit.  You know, I don't break no merchandise.  See, I get it there two hours ahead of time, all the time.  What do you say?  I say, if you pop any wheelies there, I'm not even going to put in your information. 
[02:12:00]  Listen to me.  I don't break nothing, sizzle chest.  I'm good.  Okay.  Call Monday.  We'll set up an interview.  Okay?  All right.  I'll do that there, Rubberneck.  I'll call you Monday.

[02:14:30]  She's going to call us back in 10.  We're going to call her back in 10 minutes.  All right.  Dawn wants to do What's in My Pants from the highway.  Ooh, we love that game.  That's always a lot of fun.  Let's see how our stoners are doing, Anthony.  We're going to do stoner spelling bee today for the first time on the new show.  It's PJ in D.C.  How are you, PJ?  Pretty good, pretty good.  Yeah?  How much pot have you smoked so far?  I don't know.  Maybe like 12 gravity bong hits.  12 gravity bong hits.  What's the name of your bong? 
[02:15:00]  I think we've been calling it Chandra.  Chandra.  Chandra?  Why Chandra?  Chandra Levy.  Chandra Levy?  You call your bong Chandra Levy?  It's a Chandra, but it's named after Chandra Levy.  Why would you name it after Chandra Levy?  It's local, you know?  It is local.  He's in D.C.  So...  Did you find it in a park under some leaves?  Yeah, it was buried and we dug it up.  Maybe a nice...  With a Walkman attached and a bloody jogging pants next to it. 
[02:15:30]  Jesus.  Was it pretty much a skeleton at that point?  Yeah, and just one jogging shoe?  Jesus.  Just looked like something Indiana Jones finds in a cave with a Walkman on.  Right.  All right, PJ, hold on, okay?  All right.  We're going to get this going right now, but...  All right, hold on.  Private Sparks' name is Chandra Levy, sir!  All right, let's see.  Brian's from what?  Jersey, we said?  Brian, where are you from?  Yeah, what's up?  Where are you from?  From Jersey. 
[02:16:00]  We're smoking pot in Jersey!  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!  Okay, it's a Jersey showdown today.  We got three guys from Jersey and we got PJ from D.C.  Smoking a lot of pot there, Brian?  Definitely.  I've been up since 6.30.  We're loading the bong up, Wendy!  All right.  You seem much more with it than PJ.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh-oh, I'm hearing laughing in the background.  Yeah.  Are you in a car?  I'm at work.  Oh, you're at work? 
[02:16:30]  What do you do?  Yeah.  What do you do for work?  I climb trees.  You climb trees?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  And you're smoking pot?  Definitely.  Yeah, I'm pretty screwed today.  How high up do you have to climb today?  Pretty high.  And why do you climb trees?  To chop them down?  Yeah.  All right.  Pretty fun.  It's pretty fun.  Pretty fun.  It's more gooder than most jobs out there.  Hey, dude, you ever stumble on a hornet's nest when you're doing that?  Yeah, we did like two weeks ago. 
[02:17:00]  We cut down a tree that had a whole bunch of bees on it.  What happened?  Oh, we ran.  Are you getting ready to cut down a tree today?  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, this guy's going to be good.  I was going to bail on you, but I like you now.  All right.  Hold on, Brian.  All right.  He's climbing trees.  He can break his neck.  Let's say hi to Steve in Jersey.  Steve?  Yo.  How are you doing?  I'm all right.  What's up?  Smoking a lot of dope?  I'm doing all right.  Yeah.  Do you have a bong?  No, dude.  I don't have a bong.  Smoking the joints?  No, I'm doing a bowl, actually.  I ran out of papers. 
[02:17:30]  A bowl?  All right.  Packing the bowl nice?  Yeah, yeah.  Did you buy it?  About six in, man.  Did you buy the bowl, or did you make it in wood shop?  I whittled it out of wood, man, back in the day.  I made it in wood shop.  I made a bowl in wood shop once, Opie, and you can't do that because the teachers get mad.  So he asked me what I was making.  I said I was making a sculpture of a duck, and this is the duck's head because it was  a big round ball of wood, and then it had a little thing like a bill at the end of  it, and I drilled it out. 
[02:18:00]  I love it, man.  So we called it the duck head.  Did you name it Donald, man?  Yo, pass the duck head.  Yeah, I should have called it Donald or Daffy, but just called it the duck head.  Did you go through the stage where you had to smoke your pot through fruit?  I did that.  No, it's like an emergency thing.  You find stuff to smoke it through.  In college, it became all the rage.  Let's smoke pot through an apple.  I think we did the carrot.  I'm trying to remember.  That was out of necessity, like Andrew said.  I never wanted to do that. 
[02:18:30]  Toilet pipe rolls.  A frat brother's cock.  Yeah.  You know.  You don't get high, but when it treats.  I was out of papers.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  I broke it out of the faucet.  Really?  Yeah, you unscrew the faucet off of your sink, and it's already got the screen in the  end of it.  You put a little one hit in there.  Yeah, but how dirty is a faucet with all the gunk building up?  Yeah, it's your kitchen faucet.  Water's going through it.  How dirty could it be?  What am I frat brothers?  I don't know.  He would catch spiders and smoke them.  Smoked spiders?  Yeah, he was convinced that he got a buzz off the spiders. 
[02:19:00]  Could have been all the acid the guy was doing, too.  I had a friend that worked in a machine shop, and he made this dual-bowled pipe.  It was two bowls that went down into a union and then came into a single tube.  Yeah.  So you'd fill two bowls at once.  We called it the dragon, dude.  Nice.  Because it looked like two dragon nostrils.  Spark up the dragon, man!  I think I know what else it looked like, too.  Two bowls with a thing in between them that you're putting in your mouth? 
[02:19:30]  Might have been another name for that.  Bowls, you idiot!  This guy's laughing his ass off.  We should just tell our audience to smoke pot every morning so we're funnier.  Smoke your dope.  All right, Steve.  We're going to go with you.  Hold on.  All right, man.  He's all right.  And finally, Tim.  Want to start with Tim?  Tim.  Hey, Tim.  Tim is up.  All right, you're from Jersey also.  You're from Jersey as well.  Tim in Jersey smoking weed.  Well, we're smoking weed in Jersey and getting real high.  Yeah.  Dude, you don't do the whoa, whoa, whoa. 
[02:20:00]  Whoa, whoa, whoa!  That's my favorite part of the Springsteen impression.  Dude, I fucking hate Springsteen.  Last night, I was smoking a bottle.  Springsteen blows.  Yes, he fucking does.  I sat through a show with my ex-girlfriend, and it sucked balls.  TJ is saying, did Opie just say he smoked a carrot?  Yeah, I know.  They pick up everything, don't they?  I know they do, unfortunately.  All right, Tim.  Thank you.  We're going with you.  Stay there.  All right.  Let's get this going.  It's Stoner Spelling Bee, Anthony.  We got words in front of us. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, what are these?  Political words?  Is there a theme to the words that we're having people spell?  Very clever.  Well, we want to be topical.  Hey, where's Jimmy's list?  I'd like to have some words.  Give Jimmy a list of the words.  It's the O-N-A show.  O-N-A show.  O-N-A.  I just like to have a list.  O-N-A show.  And we got the girl that wants to play What's in My Pants.  So this is going to be good.  We'll do like a round of spelling, and then we'll go to Dawn, and then we'll give those  guys time to smoke more pot. 
[02:21:00]  All right?  As Jimmy gets his words, let's go to PJ.  Anthony can pick the first word anyway.  PJ.  Give Jimmy a list.  Oh, it'll come.  No, they're getting it.  Could you do a hit on the air for us, please?  Sure.  All right.  Pack a bowl real quick.  Here's PJ.  Pack a bowl.  Smoking out of Chandra.  Little hair on the bowl.  PJ?  Yeah.  You smoking? 
[02:21:30]  I'm going right now.  Okay.  All right.  Here we go.  There's your words, Jimmy.  There we go.  Wow, PJ.  I didn't hear anything.  A little slow this morning.  He's stoned, Opie.  PJ?  PJ?  Oh.  Yeah, he's got some.  Yeah, I just heard the carburetor let go.  Yeah, he's got some action going.  Okay.  Oh.  Wow.  That's a little harsh, huh? 
[02:22:00]  Oh.  Yeah, too big.  All right, PJ.  Three strikes and you're out?  Is that how we're doing this today?  Three misspelled words and you are out of the competition.  All right.  PJ, here's your first word.  All right.  Oh, I get to pick first?  Yeah.  Okay, let's go with something easy, election-oriented.  Spell opponent.  O-P-P-O-N-E-T. 
[02:22:30]  Opponent, yes.  Opponent.  That's only valid if you live above 110th Street, that pronunciation.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  I stink.  Wrong.  All right, you got one strike.  So we got to go two strikes because this is going to take way too long.  Especially at the speed he was going.  Yeah, we'll do two strikes.  Two strikes and you're out.  We'll cut our losses. 
[02:23:00]  We understand.  Let's go to Brian in Jersey.  Brian?  Yeah, what's up?  To the other guys on hold, get ready with your hit so we can go right to you, all right?  Brian, you want to do a hit for us?  What's that?  You want to do a hit of pot?  Yeah, I can't right this second, dude.  I'm at work.  Oh, you're the tree climber, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Are you ready?  How do you feel about being pepper sprayed?  When did you last smoke?  I was for like a half an hour straight this morning.  At what time? 
[02:23:30]  Like seven, quarter after seven.  Is he stoned?  Well, you got to smoke the pot during the spelling, though.  We might have to cut our losses with Brian, I think.  You got to be stoned.  I am.  Yeah, but you got to smoke pot during the spelling.  During the contest.  And you're climbing trees, so.  Brian, you're out.  You're out.  We do have a...  No, you hear him.  No, click.  But through the magic of radio, we do have a backup.  His name is Andy from New York. 
[02:24:00]  Andy, what's going on?  What's going on, man?  How are you feeling today?  I'm good.  I got a bong, dude.  All right, let's hear your bong.  All right.  I hope I'll hang up on you guys.  It's like hard to hit and hold the phone.  All right.  What's the name of your bong?  Everyone calls it budget because it's like beat to hell.  Budget?  Yeah.  The budget bong.  The budget bong, dude.  Smoking pot is hysterical. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, right on, Andy.  Are you working today?  You know how to hold it.  What?  Are you working today?  No, I don't work.  What do you do?  I go to film school, but I'm not going to class today, though, either, because I have an acting  class today, and I don't like to go to that one.  Where do you go, NYU?  No, I go to New York Film Academy.  Who do you think is the finest director working today? 
[02:25:00]  Oliver Stone, probably.  Okay.  All right.  You ready for your word?  Yeah, sure.  Jim, why don't you give him a word there?  How about optimism?  Oh.  Uh, O-P-T-I-M-I-O-U-S-M.  Wow. 
[02:25:30]  Wow, Andy.  What's the name of the film you're working on, stupidity?  You were going real well there, and then all of a sudden, the wheels fell off the track,  man.  Optimism.  It's hard to judge how long that word is.  It certainly is.  It's not optimism.  Optimism.  You're very optimist, Alk.  That would be O-P-T-I-M-I-S-M.  Optimism.  Very good.  All right, Andy, hold on, all right?  All right.  Why he put...  All right, let's go to...  He was going so well. 
[02:26:00]  He was doing so well, and he just had to add different letters.  Let's go to Steve.  Steve in Jersey.  Yo.  How you feeling, Steve?  I'm all right.  I'm nice.  You want to do a hit or no?  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Yeah, I need some action there, right?  Bubbling.  Yeah, a little bubbling.  Yo.  He's bubbling.  All right.  All right.  You ready for your word?  Wait, real quick.  I'm recording the Monster Rain song, Jim.  Oh.  I need to get some information to send it in, though. 
[02:26:30]  All right.  What, you're going to write a song about Monster Rain?  Yeah, but, yo, do you want it to be heavy, or do you want it to be all pussy and mellow?  Well, I don't think it should be a particularly heavy song, sir, because...  Sensitive moment.  Yeah, I mean, Monster Rain is something that two boys of a young age share together.  They're afraid of the rain, and they have to hide under the porch.  It's a fear-based activity.  All right.  Just two boys staying out of the rain.  Yeah, we invite our listeners to write songs.  We like that.  We would like to hear a few Monster Rain songs.  Yes.  All right.  Why don't you give him a word? 
[02:27:00]  I'm just going to play like host here today.  I'll be.  All right.  Let's look.  Another election word, Opie.  Okay.  If you would spell incumbent.  May I jump in and say, if you need it in a sentence, sir, you can ask for that, too.  I'm sure Ant will be willing to.  All right.  Do you need it in a sentence?  No.  You said incumbent?  Yes.  Okay.  I-N-C-U-M-B-E-N-T.  Very good.  Oh, yeah.  Bingo. 
[02:27:30]  Jersey.  Jersey.  Let's hear it for Jersey.  All right.  We got to go right to Tim.  Let's see.  Tim, another guy from Jersey.  Tim, how are you feeling?  I'm getting stoned in Jersey.  He certainly is.  I was smoking a drink for you guys.  All right.  Very nice.  All right.  All right.  Give me a word.  I don't want to know.  I love how they have the pot smoke in their mouth sound.  You know that sound?  You kind of get this weird sound in your voice.  Yeah, I'm smoking a drink. 
[02:28:00]  All right.  Give me.  Give me.  Give me the word.  All right.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  Hindrance.  Hindrance.  Hindrance.  When I was a boy, my father would say, Jimmy, be a help and not a hindrance.  H-I-N-D-R-E-N-C-E.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  It's spelling in Jersey.  It's smoking weed.  It's A-N-C-E, sir.  You're very close. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Norton.  All right.  Well, after the first round, PJ, one strike.  Andy, one strike.  Tim, one strike.  Only Steve is, well, Steve's leading, basically.  All right.  Hold on there.  Keep smoking your pot, all right?  Yeah.  How are we going to do?  Should Guess What's in My Pants call back?  No.  No?  You want to go through that?  No.  Let those guys get a little stuck.  Yeah.  Let them get more stoned.  All right.  Someone, Steve, why don't you work the phones and see how the guys are doing?  Make sure they get nice and stoned, and we'll go to Dawn.  We don't have to play any commercials today, right?  We might just keep going all the way to the end today, because we've got lots to do. 
[02:29:00]  Hey, Dawn, what's going on?  Oh, not much.  How are you guys?  And Dawn's from Jersey, too.  Dawn's from Jersey.  There's a lot of listeners from Jersey.  Where in Jersey, Dawn?  Right now, I'm somewhere out in Jackson.  Oh, it's South Jersey.  Rub that phone on your tunnel of love.  In Jersey, baby.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  I've missed you guys.  We miss you.  We miss you.  Now, Jackson, isn't that where those freaks are living in the woods? 
[02:29:30]  Those weird people?  No, actually, you mean down in Tom's River where the homo, the homo hobo just got beat up?  No, no, no, no, no.  Those, uh...  Isn't Jackson where, um, which great adventure?  The albino people.  They live in the woods in Jersey somewhere.  What's that story?  I can't remember.  The Jersey Devil?  No, no.  I love the Finelands.  I hope there's no, I'm like right by the woods in Jackson.  Yeah, there's some fidget people, there's albino fidgets, there's some kind of albino  devil people.  The Jersey Devil?  Jersey's got some weird things going on there. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Girls with big backs on Commercial Avenue in New Brunswick.  Hey there, Dawn, is your daddy home?  Would you rub your pussy hair all on the phone?  In Jersey.  Wah, wah, wah.  Wow, that's great.  That's great.  Well, she's going to play Guess What's in My Pants.  Yes.  Who did you vote for yesterday, Dawn, as you get naked?  I voted for Bush.  Yeah.  Of course you did.  Make your own joke there. 
[02:30:30]  All right.  She voted for Bush and Jersey went to Carrie, didn't it?  Yep.  Yeah, I knew that was going to happen.  Of course it does.  Are you getting naked right now?  Yeah.  Okay, as you get naked, why don't we play the theme song really fast here?  Oh, the theme.  Hit it.  Jolly.  Jolly.  Da-da-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Time to play?  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  Place the receiver upon your beaver. 
[02:31:00]  New line.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  It's time to guess what's in my pants.  My pants.  Oh, isn't that great?  Hey, I didn't know we jazzed up the theme song.  It is.  Is that all Steve C singing?  No.  No, I think that's our old pal Jimmy helping out, right?  That's our old pal Jimmy helping out all the way from Colorado.  That's Jim who did the original song.  Beliella?  Exactly.  Yes.  Oh, he's great.  He was brave.  He was confident about that new verse.  Yeah, he really was. 
[02:31:30]  He really sold it.  My pants.  I can't wait to hear it after this is over.  I want to hear that again now.  All right, so we got Dawn on the phone to play Guess What's in My Pants.  Basically, she's naked on the side of the road near the woods.  Skirt.  Yeah, what were you wearing?  A skirt?  Blue jeans?  Skirt.  Skirt.  Okay.  What kind of panties?  Well, not really any because I was wearing pantyhose.  Pantyhose?  Yes.  They get all sweaty.  Yeah, but it's all matted in there.  It's all nice.  No, no, no. 
[02:32:00]  Nice.  Very clean.  That panel, that pantyhose panel that covers that area.  I hate the panel.  You don't like the panel?  No.  I like a nice hall where the lips are just drooping out.  I want it to look like the kid from the Fat Albert cartoon wearing the hat with the big  lips just popping out.  Hee-bity, hee-bity, hee-bity.  All right, well.  Whatever works for you, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Dawn is going to rub the phone up and down, side to side, and in a circular motion, and  then...  We will figure out just from the sounds made. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, because we're experts at this.  We're experts.  What type of hairstyle she has.  Now, let's review the hairstyles.  There's the natural, which is just the natural triangle of hair that grows on a woman.  And that could be anything.  It could be kind of trimmed down a little bit, or a big 70s earth mama muff, but unless you're  trimming the sides down, and you see some stubble there, that's the natural.  It's just natural triangular hair.  Then, there's the landing strip, or mohawk, as we like to call it, which is pretty self-explanatory. 
[02:33:00]  You've shaved the sides in off of your triangle.  So, now you just have a landing strip.  Then, there's the Hitler mustache, which is like a landing strip, only a lot shorter from  top to bottom.  It looks like a little Hitler mustache.  That's what it looks like.  And then there's the always popular wood floor, the clean shaved, the slick, or the  JonBenet Ramsey.  But also the five o'clock shadow.  Yes, we will allow the five o'clock shadow to be a guess, but that's kind of like a wood 
[02:33:30]  floor also.  I understand, but that's if they shaved, like, yesterday, you know what I mean?  Yeah, if they shaved yesterday or the day before.  That throws us off a lot.  It does, but that's still considered a wood floor, or you want to make it another category?  There is a difference.  I don't want to get too confusing, but...  All right, well, yeah, you could just throw that in if you feel like it.  You know, a wood floor is a wood floor.  But sometimes...  Yeah, but now you're really limiting wood floor.  I think even stubble should be wood floor.  It's shaved, because if this girl shaved yesterday and has a little bit of stubble, come on, it's 
[02:34:00]  a wood floor.  Did you hear that?  So if you guess wood floor, you're really limiting your chances of winning.  All right.  So I'm saying the stubble is also wood floor.  All right.  Steve, how are the stoners doing?  I want to make sure they're still there.  If it's any longer than Steve's head, then there's a problem.  They're hanging in there?  They're all pretty lit.  All right.  Make sure they don't go anywhere.  Okay, Dawn, are you ready?  I am.  All right.  Let's start with the up and down.  Up and down?  Okay, here I go.  Hold on.  Here we go.  Let's listen. 
[02:34:30]  Get up.  How old are you?  32.  Okay.  Any kids?  No.  Mm-hmm.  No piercings, right?  Not down there.  Not down there.  Oh, you got the nip piercings?  No.  Oh, good.  Belly button.  No, tongue.  Belly button.  Belly button.  Belly button.  All right.  Side to side, Dawn.  Okay.  That's some lip action.  That was telling.  Could you do that one more time, if I may? 
[02:35:00]  Side to side?  Hold on.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  The lip is being dragged from side to side.  Do you think?  Yeah.  It sounds like Burt Reynolds calming his mustache.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  And, Dawn, finally, the circular motion.  Yeah.  Okay. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, the circular was a little off.  Could you do it, like, a little smoother?  You know, like three circles around, but not stop?  Okay.  Sure.  Hold on.  Yeah.  No.  All right.  She's got something going on down there.  I think I know.  I think I know.  You want to hear anything else, Jimmy?  Jimmy is kicking ass in this game.  One more on the side to side.  Side to side.  All right.  Okay.  I need a top to bottom to verify something, please.  Oh, my God.  Hold on. 
[02:36:00]  Top to bottom.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Good.  Okay.  I need you to slide.  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  I need you to slide the phone in and do 30 jumping jacks on the hood.  All right.  Well, Anthony, it's to you.  All right.  Now, remember, Dawn, do not give us any inkling whatsoever what you have down there until we  ask you.  Okay.  No matter what we guess.  Okay?  Okay.  Opie, I am going to say she is sporting the Mohawk. 
[02:36:30]  Wow.  I'm going to say Mohawk.  I think I heard, but we'll see.  Okay.  I'm inclined to go Mohawk, too, but for something's telling me Wood Floor.  I don't know why I'm thinking Wood Floor with a five o'clock, but Mohawk was my first  entity.  I'm going to go Wood Floor.  Wood Floor?  I'm going to go with the, oh, man, Well-Groomed Triangle.  Well-Groomed Triangle.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Well, that would fall into the triangle category, which is kind of a good category to go for  because it covers a lot of area, but many girls don't go with the triangle anymore, 
[02:37:00]  so that limits that.  I know, but it's either that or the five o'clock shadow Wood Floor.  Yeah.  I would like to call it the Jackie Chan Eye.  With or without the eyebrow.  Oh, good call.  I didn't think it threw that far.  All right.  What are you going with, Opie?  You know, I stink at this game lately.  No, you don't, Opie.  Come on, now.  I'm not feeling too good about myself these days.  No?  That's no attitude to have. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, you'll get some confidence if you pull this one off.  All right.  I'm going to go with the triangle.  You're going to go with the natural triangle.  Dawn, what is in your pants?  Wood Floor.  Wood Floor.  All right.  Hold on.  I said possibly Wood Floor with the five o'clock shadow.  You had to make a guess.  I said shadow.  No, I know I lose, but I want to, for my own good.  Okay.  I don't care for your own good, but you lost.  When was the last time you shaved two days ago?  When was the last time you shaved?  I shaved this morning.  This morning.  So, that is the deception with the Wood Floor. 
[02:38:00]  The skin, just bare skin rubbing on the receiver sounds like a lot of hair.  Right.  So, it's very hard.  I thought I heard something back and forth, but like Opie said, it was probably just the  lips.  I thought I heard a hair strip when you were doing the back.  Are you dressed yet?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I was going to ask you to do it again so we could hear it.  All right.  It sounded like hair and like somebody was strumming a bass.  All right, Dawn.  Thanks for playing Guess What's in My Pass.  Bye, Dawn.  Thank you.  Oh, the song.  That's great. 
[02:38:30]  Sing along now.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pass?  Place the receiver upon your beaver.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  It's time to guess what's in my pants.  My pants.  My pants.  I love it.  Pants.  Pants.  Love how he says, my pants. 
[02:39:00]  Pants.  Tell Jimmy thanks, Steve.  That's great.  You know what?  I got to take a leak and then we'll continue with Stoner's.  Are you going to the bathroom now?  Jimmy, you just went.  You're going to follow him in?  I think I may have to blow my nose or something.  Show him those nice silk boxer shorts you're wearing today.  Yeah.  Please.  I'm not going.  Please.  No, no, no.  How uncomfortable was I yesterday at Bob Kelly's house eating chili and I'm sitting there talking  to his girlfriend and he's standing across the room and he's facing away and he just  pulls his pants down and he's talking to his dick.  Why?  It was just to really bother me and it really did. 
[02:39:30]  With his girlfriend there?  Oh yeah, she was just laughing.  It didn't bother you.  You got giggling like idiots.  Wait, you're standing there eating.  No, I'm sitting there eating some chili.  Sitting eating chili.  He's probably 15 feet away on the other side of the room and he just pulls down his  boxers and he's just standing, or his shorts and he's standing there with this awful soft  junk.  That's hilarious.  You comics.  I don't know what it is.  Like a mealworm with an afro.  With that, let's get out of here. 
[02:40:00]  It was whip him out Wednesday, so I flashed some guy on the Long Island Expressway.  He was involved in a seven car pileup.  There was blood and carnage everywhere.  But my tits looked great.  Please, wow responsibly.  A public service announcement of the Opie and Anthony show.  From behind me, a young woman of 25 uttered the dumbest thing I'd ever heard in my life.  That was until the next year when Dan Quayle was elected the vice president and things  took a turn. 
[02:40:30]  She said, if it weren't for my horse, I wouldn't have spent that year in college.  I'll repeat that.  I'll repeat that because that's the kind of sentence when you hear it, your brain comes  to a screeching halt.  And the left-hand side of the brain looks at the right-hand side of the brain and goes,  it's dark in here.  And we may die.  She said, if it weren't for my horse, giddy-up, giddy-up, let's go, I wouldn't have spent that  year in college, a degree-granting institution. 
[02:41:00]  Don't!  Don't think about that sentence for more than three minutes or blood will shoot out your  nose.  The American medical profession doesn't know why we get an aneurysm.  It's when a blood vessel bursts in our head for no apparent reason.  There's a reason.  You're at the mall one day and somebody over there says the dumbest thing you've ever heard  and it goes in your ear.  So you turn around to see if your friends heard it.  Because if your friends heard it and you can talk about what the jackass said, then it'll  be gone. 
[02:41:30]  But your friends are over here and they're pretending that they're going to buy a cellular  phone.  And they're not going to buy a cellular phone because they don't even understand how the  rate structure works.  So you turn back.  You turn back to find the person who said it.  Because if you ask them a question like, what the fuck are you talking about?  Then it'll go away.  But they're gone.  And now those words are in your head.  And those words don't go away.  Because the way I see it, 7% of our brain functions all the time. 
[02:42:00]  Because 99% of everything that happens, it's the same old stuff.  We get it.  Okay, right.  Move on.  Get it.  Right.  But every so often, something like that happens.  If it weren't for my horse, I wouldn't have spent that year in college.  And your brain goes, let's figure it out.  Son of a bitch.  I wonder what that's about.  I wonder, was she riding the horse to school?  No, she wouldn't be riding the horse to school.  Maybe it was a polo pony.  She had a polo pony scholarship.  Maybe she sold the horse.  And that's how she was batting on it.  What the fuck? 
[02:42:30]  And then you realize that anybody who went to college would never say anything that stupid in public.  And as soon as you have that thought, your eyes close.  And the next morning, they find you dead in your bathroom.  So, so let me tell you a little bit about myself.  I grew up in Hollywood, California my whole life in Hollywood and stuff.  It's okay, bro.  It's okay.  But one thing I'm kind of edged about is I miss out in that Buff family upbringing, you know? 
[02:43:00]  The Wonder Bread, you know, the gravy.  Dad coming downstairs like in his polka dot box.  Just pull my finger, you know?  You know, the grits, the cow tipping.  Never had the nice, warm, buff Michael Brady hug, you know?  And sir, you kind of look like the dad I never had, man.  Can I get a Michael Brady hug, too?  Cool, that was cool.  Check out the wood you created. 
[02:43:30]  I come from like a wealthy divorce family.  You know, like my mom's wealthy.  My dad's like divorced.  Oh, well, Padre, dude, that's what happens.  I'm glad, though, like my mom didn't remarry, though.  I don't have any stepdads hanging around the house.  Yeah, guys that think they're my real dad, right?  Let's go to the park, son.  I'm like, yeah, okay, Mark.  He's like, hey, hey, why don't you call me dad? 
[02:44:00]  Because you're not, man.  You're some guy that sits around my mom's pool and sponges off her.  You know, kind of like a bigger version of me.  So I was in the grocery store, and there was this stock boy stacking melons.  So I figured, hey, I'll show him some real melons.  Well, when I flashed him, he lost his balance, and the entire stack of melons came crashing down on him. 
[02:44:30]  He was suffocated under two tons of melons.  But my melons are still juicy and perky.  Please, wow responsibly.  A public service announcement of the Opie and Anthony show.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:45:00]  Let's go right to the phones and talk to Poppy before we get back to Stoner Spelling Bee.  The Jackson Whites, those albinos, are living in the woods.  Oh, that's what they're called.  In the woods.  What's the story, Poppy?  Well, they live up in the hills.  They're like runaway slaves and Indians and a couple other things mixed together.  They've been hanging out in the woods for like 100 years, and they're all inbred. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, they're all inbred.  They don't go outside of their little group.  So they're so screwed up.  This isn't...  It's pretty hot, he said.  This isn't folklore.  This is the real deal, right?  No urban legend.  Yeah.  No, definitely.  I've seen them up there.  And there was one guy ranting for...  I'm sorry.  Go ahead, go.  He was ranting for about a half hour in a Chinese restaurant saying nobody spoke English.  Hmm.  All right.  Yeah, very strange.  Yeah.  And what do they live in?  Shacks, or are they just...  No, I've seen some shacks, but some of them have houses. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  There you go.  The Jackson Whites.  Oh, and the other thing.  Norton.  Sir, I'm...  It's just not going to happen like that.  Of course it wouldn't.  He thought he got you.  Especially when you go semicolon and another thing.  Norton.  Yes.  Pause.  Eagerly awaiting Norton to say yes, sir, or something.  You know what I'm going to miss about tough crowd is in the dressing room when new guests  would be on to get to...  Like, you start talking to somebody. 
[02:46:30]  Like, what kind of gigs are you working on?  Well, I'm getting...  And then you just take the dressing room door and you slam it in their face.  There was very few gags.  The worst ones I ever got...  I got Jeff Garland so bad.  So I'm like, dude, what's it like out in L.A. these days?  He's like, well, man, I mean...  Whack!  That's a great thing.  Stephen Colbert, I got probably the worst ever was Stephen Colbert from The Daily Show.  And he loved it, of course.  He's a funny guy, so he laughed.  Yeah, he is.  Oh, Garland was not happy.  That's a great bit.  It's the greatest thing.  Because that dressing room, you've been a tough crowd. 
[02:47:00]  That dressing room door is so loud and there's ten people in the room.  We're going to have to do that on this show.  We'll ask a stupid question like that and we'll all at the same time turn off our mics,  put our headphones on and walk out of the studio.  Do you know Hal Spears?  Anybody from...  What was it like from the Queerest Folk?  Hal Sparks?  I'm sorry, you're right.  Hal Sparks.  I hated my guts for that.  Really?  Oh, did I get him good?  He seems like he has a sense of humor, though.  Yeah, you'd think so, but nope.  No, not when he gets the door slammed on him.  That is really funny. 
[02:47:30]  Let's not...  Well...  All right, let's get back to Stoner Spelling Bee, Anthony.  Yes.  We got PJ on the line from D.C.  PJ, how are you feeling?  It's been a while now.  I'm sorry.  Pretty fucked up, man.  All right.  Yeah, PJ has one strike.  If he doesn't get this word right,  he's going to be out of the competition, Anthony.  Out of the competition.  What have you been doing for the last 20 minutes?  I've been taking mad bongers, man.  Yeah.  Mad bong hits.  And did you like to guess what's in my pants today?  It was pretty good.  Pretty good.  Pretty good?  Pretty good? 
[02:48:00]  He's relaxed.  He's stoned.  All right.  Are you watching TV or anything,  or are you just kind of sitting there in your room?  I was playing Grand Theft Auto,  but I'm just too hard to play anymore.  Oh, really?  You can't get anything done?  Yeah.  I can't concentrate anymore.  He just stands around doing nothing.  Even in a game.  All right.  Well, Anthony, you got a word for PJ?  This could be it for PJ.  Might be.  Okay.  Well, I'm going to really test him.  Campaign. 
[02:48:30]  Campaign.  P-A-M-T-A-I-G-N.  PJ is still in the game.  Wow.  I thought I had him there.  Very good, PJ.  Hold on the line, okay?  We're going to go to Steve in Jersey.  Steve, how are you feeling?  I'm doing good, man.  All right.  Are you getting real stoned now?  Yeah.  I'm almost at delirium, dude.  Yeah?  What are you thinking?  What?  Almost at delirium. 
[02:49:00]  Oh.  What are you thinking about?  I'm just sitting here with the phone attached to my fucking ear.  You got any thoughts going through that brain?  No.  Not really?  Not thinking about anything at all?  I'm just spacing out, looking at the ceiling.  How old a guy are you?  I'm like 29, man.  He's like 29, almost.  I guess he's 28 or 30.  You live in your mom's basement?  No, but not really.  No, my dad.  He lives in your dad's basement?  And he works at the deli.  No.  Where do you work?  Huh?  Oh, man.  I work at a place in Jackson that Norton mentioned earlier. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Oh, really?  All right.  You ready for your next word?  Are you like one of those PSAs on TV where your father yells down the stairs to you and  what are you doing?  Nothing.  No, I told him I was falling into this.  And he starts spraying the spray around.  Do you hide your pot smoke from your dad?  No, I have respect and go outside, you know.  But this morning it was a little cold and I kind of told him it was a special event. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah, this is a definite special event.  It's good to hear you guys back.  All right, cool.  Who taught you how to do this stuff?  You, all right?  I learned it by watching you.  Is that you and your dad?  That's what you say when you get caught banging your mother?  No.  Hey, are you a ride operator at a certain theme park?  No.  Oh, okay.  Because he lives in Jackson.  I worked there.  What's that?  I never said I worked there.  Okay.  You're right.  That's a great adventure getting out of there alive.  You ever smoke pot with your dad? 
[02:50:30]  No, dude.  Does he smoke pot?  He used to.  He told me some nice stories, but it'd just be too weird, man.  Yeah.  Did he ever catch you watching a dirty movie and then say, ah, don't turn it off and sit  down next to you?  You hear me, it'd just be too weird, man.  Yeah, is he still married to your mom?  No.  No?  No.  Is he dating some hot pieces of asses or what?  He's got a nice Latino woman.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Wow.  Do you want to do his chick?  No, dude.  I remember when my dad used to, like, I had to visit him on the weekends after my parents  got divorced and he'd have, like, his whore of the week and they were trying to, like, 
[02:51:00]  it's so funny because they were really into my father.  So, they had to make like they liked us kids.  But, thinking back, they were just, you know, they were in their 20s girls, just some whore  bag, I guess, and my father was banging.  And they'd be, you know, oh, great, your kids, I have to spend time with your kids on the  weekend.  And, uh, they were pretty hot, but just dumb as dirt.  So, Anthony, what are you interested in?  Like, we're going to spark up a relationship. 
[02:51:30]  Like, I'm going to confide in her and, you know, she'll be mommy too.  Could you just go bang my dad?  I'm playing Hot Wheels with my brother, Joe.  Suck on dad's Italian sausage and leave me alone, please.  Yeah, I don't want to be bothered.  You're not my mommy.  And it was like a one-bedroom apartment thing.  Say hi to your new mommy.  Your new mommy.  It was a one-bedroom apartment, so I'd have to, like, look and see the bed that I knew  they were having sex on.  It's like just an awful situation.  Your dad bringing home chippies? 
[02:52:00]  Yeah?  He's just banging the Latino one.  Oh, the little Latina, huh?  He's doing all right.  All right, Steve.  You have no strikes here, so let's see.  Norton's got a word for you.  I'm ready.  Auxiliary.  Who?  Auxiliary.  Who?  Auxiliary.  What happened?  Auxiliary.  Yes.  A-U-X.  I-L-I-A-R-Y. 
[02:52:30]  Say it.  I didn't hear.  You got it.  Oh, did he say it right?  Yeah.  Okay, good work.  Yeah, I heard him slurring.  He slurred the I-A together at the end.  Oh, I didn't hear.  Okay.  All right, Steve.  I'm going to say goodbye to you for a little bit here.  Good, man.  We'll get back to Steve in a minute.  Let's say hi to Tim again.  Tim in Jersey.  Hey, Tim, how you feeling?  I'm fucking whacked.  What?  What?  I'm fucking whacked.  Whoa.  What are you wearing, Tim?  Uh, I just was only asking what you were trying, what you were wearing. 
[02:53:00]  Well, actually, I'm wearing nothing.  No.  Did we find out what he does for a living?  I'm an environmental technician.  I test dirt.  You test dirt?  Well, I test home heating oil tanks underground.  Oh, see if there's any leakage?  Yeah, exactly.  For contamination.  So, how's your buzz going?  I'm fucking whacked as shit, dude.  I smoked like an ace today.  Are you?  I'm fucking thanks, bud.  Nice.  Are you thinking any weird thoughts that you want to share with anyone?  Yeah, actually, I had a really stupid idea.  Okay.  I have an FM modulator in my van and so does somebody else in my company. 
[02:53:30]  We put them together and you can hear you guys on the radio in the house.  You should make stickers that say put your modulators to 88.1 and spread the virus on FM as well as XM.  I've heard that this works.  I've heard that this kind of works.  So, if you're close enough to your house, it'll modulate to the radio?  You can be like a quarter mile away.  I've had guys follow me with their cars that don't have, you know, any XM equipment at all and they put it on 88.1.  They're like up close to a quarter mile away and they hear it.  Wow. 
[02:54:00]  There you go.  I've heard this works.  Oops.  Hey, dude.  So, if you work within a quarter mile of your house, why buy a roadie, too?  Right.  All right.  Well, I got a Skype.  I'll buy the radio button so, you know, you can turn people on to it by having a bumper sticker in traffic.  Nice.  It's an 88.1 for L&A.  All right.  You got the boon box?  Not yet.  I'm waiting for it.  I'm waiting to buy it.  The boon box.  I got a boon box.  A boon box.  Oh, that would have been a good one for Marion.  Yeah, that's good.  And, Tim, you ready for your next word? 
[02:54:30]  Yeah, it's a boon box.  A boon box.  Yeah, give me a word.  All right.  Let's go.  If Tim gets this word wrong, he'll be out of the competition.  Go ahead, Anthony.  All right.  Let's go with provisional.  Provisional?  P-R-O-V-I-S-I-O-N-A-L.  He's still in the game.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He's still in the game.  All right, Tim.  Hang in there.  We're going to go to Andy in New York.  Andy, what's up?  Hey, what's going on? 
[02:55:00]  How are you feeling?  Pretty good, man.  Are you outside?  No, I'm in my apartment.  Oh, okay.  What have you been doing the last 20 minutes?  I've just been hitting the bong.  All right.  Kind of watching TV.  What are you watching?  Yeah, what's on TV?  I don't know.  I was just watching, like, election coverage, and then I wanted to play PlayStation, but then  I just didn't.  So, right now, the PlayStation thing is just on.  All right.  Just watching the PlayStation screen?  I'm not watching, no, I'm not doing that right now, like, earlier.  All right.  You got any crazy thoughts you want to share with everybody? 
[02:55:30]  Uh, nah.  Nah?  Nah.  Really?  I just want to tell Jim Norton that I'm sad the tough crowd is gone, because that was  an awesome show.  Thanks, man.  We are, too.  I appreciate that.  All right.  With that...  I live right in the village, and, like, every night I see, like, Patrice and, like, all  you guys walking around and shit.  Oh, come by the comedy show and some nights.  We're always there.  Yeah, I definitely will.  All right.  Well, Jim, give Andy a word.  Uh, the word I'm going to give to Andy is, um, let me see here.  I'm sorry, Andy.  I had it, and I...  Oh, gorilla, but as in warfare, not as in, uh, as in the ape. 
[02:56:00]  I thought you were talking about Patrice walking around.  Where's that bell?  I know.  All right.  Gorilla.  Mandy.  Uh, G-U-R-I-L-L-R-I-L-L-A.  Oh, no.  Sorry, Andy.  I was rooting for you.  We have to say goodbye to Andy.  Oh.  That's okay. 
[02:56:30]  It was G-U-E, man.  You just missed it.  Yeah.  Andy, thanks for playing Stoner Spelling Bee.  Uh, thanks for having me.  All right.  Call back any time, all right?  All right, man.  Thanks, O.  Come to the cellar one night and wear a yellow handkerchief.  I'll come tonight.  Are you there tonight?  Uh, no.  I'm actually doing a benefit at the Stress Factory for U.S. soldiers, so if you're doing  the budget tonight.  I used to live in Jersey.  I used to go there all the time.  Yeah, I'll be there tonight only with Voss and a couple other guys for some benefit for  the troops.  All right.  All right.  There he goes.  Thank you, Andy.  You like golden showers?  I just like to watch. 
[02:57:00]  Uh, PJ from D.C.  We're back to you, buddy.  All right.  What's up?  All right.  You're doing good, right?  Yeah, man.  You want to do another hit?  Uh, I lost my lighter, man.  I can't.  Lost his lighter?  How did you lose your lighter?  It fell behind my couch.  He sounds really stoned.  You got any thoughts on that head of yours?  No, man.  I'm just looking at the GTA screen.  What's on the GTA screen right now?  Just a couple of cops shooting a couple golfers, man. 
[02:57:30]  Cops shooting golfers.  Very good.  Okay.  Anthony, why don't you give PJ a word?  All righty.  Let's try.  Let me look.  Let me get a good one.  Gubernatorial.  Jesus.  What?  Gubernatorial.  Let me use that in a sentence.  If you're a gay Israeli poet, you can mess up the gubernatorial election. 
[02:58:00]  I have no idea.  Well, start with G.  I'll give you that much.  Yeah.  Let's give it a shot.  G.  Gubernatorial.  G-O.  Yeah.  U-B.  Okay.  You're still in it, buddy.  E-R.  Uh-huh.  N-A.  Uh-huh.  No, N-E.  Right.  Right.  T-T-O-R-E-L-A. 
[02:58:30]  E-L-A.  Wow.  Wow.  You could not be more wrong.  You got the G right.  Yeah.  You got the G right.  That was it.  Oh, great.  That was a good crash and burn, PJ, but we're going to have to say goodbye to you, all right?  All right.  See you later.  There he goes.  PJ from D.C.  Bye, sweetie.  All right.  It's down to Steve, who's smoking pot in Jersey. 
[02:59:00]  And Tim from Jersey.  That's it.  Steve, what's going on?  Nothing.  You know, my lighter ran out, and I went upstairs and got another lighter.  Yeah, you're motivated.  See that?  Yeah, he's still very motivated.  See, if he would have gotten up and gotten his lighter and smoked a little more weed, I might not have given him such a hard word.  That was a hard fucking word.  That's really a hard word.  Would you have gotten that one?  I don't know.  No, you don't know.  Don't give it to me.  Because it's gubernatorial. 
[02:59:30]  Like, yeah, G-O-O-B-E-R.  No.  What?  No.  No.  All right, Jim, give Steve a word here.  Steve has no strikes, by the way.  Steve, the word is colonel, but not as in corn, as in rank.  Like clink.  Right.  Colonel.  This word's always fucking hot.  As in, I had misbehaved, so the colonel came in and gave me a mouthful of discipline. 
[03:00:00]  I don't know, man.  C-O-N.  C-O-N, good.  Come on, bro.  Halfway there.  Halfway there.  Wait, hold on.  There's like an L in there.  A couple L's or something.  All right, a couple L's, good.  Just put it all together now.  Come on.  C-O-N.  C-O-N, yeah.  L-E-L?  L-E-L.  Yes, a canalel.  Fuck you.  Conelel.  Conelel, clink.  I am Conelel. 
[03:00:30]  Wow.  All right, well, that's your first strike.  You want to spell that one, Jimmy?  The word is C-O-L-O-N-E-L.  Colonel.  Colonal.  Oh, wait a minute.  Did I say the word wrong?  Yeah.  Colonal.  No, of course it's colonel.  You didn't say colonel, man.  Of course it's colonel.  We're going to keep both these guys on the line.  Silly goose.  I swear to God, I just doubted myself what a dummy I am.  Tim, you're on the line with Steve.  Tim, here's the deal.  If you get this word wrong, Steve will be the stoner spelling bee champion. 
[03:01:00]  Okay.  There's no R in colonel.  Why is that?  Tim, doesn't Steve have to then spell a word correctly?  No, because it's the last of the second or third round.  Oh.  All right.  If Tim spells correctly, then we'll play another round.  That's what it's going to come down to.  All right.  Tim, how are you feeling, buddy?  I'm fucking pretty stoned.  You're pretty stoned, okay?  You think you could keep spelling here?  Yeah.  Why not?  All right.  Okay.  Is Steve laughing at Tim? 
[03:01:30]  What?  Where is your jersey Steve from?  I'm around Trenton, dude.  Oh, okay.  You're representing Central Jersey.  Where are you at?  Newton.  Representing.  Newton.  I used to hang out up there.  Was he just elected representative or something if he's representing?  I don't know.  I love when white guys represent.  You're not representing anything.  All right.  Come down.  Representing 80% of the population, yo.  Wow. 
[03:02:00]  Okay.  Who's getting this, Tim?  Yeah, Tim.  Yeah.  Tim, your word is environment.  Oh, this is easy.  I'm an environmental technician.  Yeah, dude.  Well, sometimes it happens like, oh, hey, hold on.  I'm kind of biased.  No, did you ever realize sometimes in Jeopardy, the guy that's the skipper of a boat gets anchor  for an answer or something?  It just happens.  Well, why don't you make it fair and give Steve the word loser?  I mean...  Oh.  And just because he does the job doesn't mean he can spell it. 
[03:02:30]  Oh, my God.  You want Tim to win.  I didn't rip it up.  You want it again?  I'm glad I'm not in this contest.  Third wheel would have been my word.  That's right.  Jim, cocksucker.  F-U-N, wait.  All right, Tim.  D-I-C-T-I-O-N. 
[03:03:00]  Goddamn.  Ben fell.  What happened, Ben?  You almost fell off your chair laughing that hard?  Jesus.  All right.  All right.  Let's see if he can spell it correctly.  Are you really going to give him environment?  I have to.  I gave it to him.  What am I going to do?  Not give it to him?  All right, Tim.  Spell environment.  Yeah, yeah.  E-N-T-E-I-R-O-N-M-E-N-T.  All right.  That's cool, man.  Steve, that's not fair, is it now?  I would say it's a little unfair.  All right.  Give him an easy word.  We'll give him an easy word.  What do you do for a living, Steve?  I'm in management, man. 
[03:03:30]  All right.  Just to be fair, environment.  You think he can spell it right after the other guy?  I don't know.  Now give him a word.  I will.  Hold on.  Steve, come on now.  I'm ready.  I'm trying to give him a nice, not too hard of one.  All right.  Here's one because it kind of sums up the red and the blue.  Difference.  Difference?  Yes.  D-I-F-F-E-R-E-N-C-E.  Atta boy.  All right.  There we go.  We're over that controversy.  All right.  It's back to you.  How many strikes for each one? 
[03:04:00]  One.  If Tim spells incorrectly here, then Steve will be the winner.  Uh-oh.  Back to Tim.  All right.  Tim?  Yes.  Your word is tester.  I'm kidding, of course.  Soil.  Dirt.  Stop it.  All right.  Go ahead.  All right.  We will give you the word.  Left-wing fanatic.  Acquaintance.  Oh.  Ooh. 
[03:04:30]  Ooh.  Acquaintance.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  A-Q-U-A-T-I.  I don't fucking know.  Wait, wait.  That's if you're friends with water.  Wait.  A-Q-U-A-I-N-T-I-N-C-E-O.  Oh, my dear.  I'll say you don't.  Same way.  Sorry.  Now, does the next guy have to spell a word right, though, because he's had one word less?  No.  That's it.  That's it?  Yeah.  No, he's got to.  Yeah.  No, he's got to. 
[03:05:00]  That was the end of, like, the fifth or sixth round.  I'm serious.  All right.  I'm done.  Tim?  Jimmy, about that show.  You can get single tickets?  Yes, you can.  Thank you very much, sir.  You're welcome.  But go on Ticketmaster, because they will sell after the announcement.  All right.  I'm fucking punching out.  See you soon.  I'll see you soon, pal.  Hold on, Tim.  We're going to put...  We should give Tim a prize, too.  I think so, too.  Do we even have prizes to give away?  Yeah, what prizes are we giving away?  All right, Tim.  We're going to give you some fine prizes.  I don't know.  What do we have there, Ben? 
[03:05:30]  I'm curious.  What prize?  We have swag.  Oh, boy.  When they say they got swag, that means...  That's crap.  That's crap.  We're giving you crap.  Give him the smelly wiffle ball bat.  No.  He could smoke dope out of it.  Make a bong.  I'll make a bong out of a wiffle ball bat.  All right, Tim.  Thank you.  There he goes.  We'll give you a pair of boxer briefs that Mr. Poe grappled in.  Let's hear it for Steve from Jersey.  Thanks, guys.  And what does Steve get for winning Stoner Spelling Bee, Ben?  I just want to hear you say swag. 
[03:06:00]  We'll find some swag.  Oh, my God.  It's an honor.  It's an honor?  All right.  Well, hold on a line, man.  You were a lot of fun today.  Any final thoughts?  It's just great to hear you guys, man.  All right, cool.  Spread the virus for us, right?  Take it easy, Jersey.  Yeah, Jersey.  Pete.  One Stoner Spelling Bee.  One Stoner Spelling Bee.  Later, guys.  All right.  Hold on a line.  There goes Steve.  What a guy.  The winner of Stoner Spelling Bee.  That was a lot of fun.  Very good.  Hey, Carlos from Newark. 
[03:06:30]  Checking in.  Anthony, while I'm playing GTA, grab your camera.  Stalk a chick for a while, snapping pictures and whatnot.  Then beat her to a pulp.  Take some more pictures.  Later, you can show the pics to your friends.  Kind of like scrapbooking, only cool because it's murder.  Isn't that fun?  I found the camera.  You found the camera?  I found the camera, GTA.  Have you taken pictures?  I started taking pictures of cleavage.  We should start of cleavage.  Oh, yeah.  All the hookers.  We should get together a GTA photo album for the show.  Put it up on the website.  It's not a bad idea.  See what we're doing.  I'm going to snap some pictures. 
[03:07:00]  You know what I need is the fake commercials.  I don't know if Ben could get it from Laszlo, or maybe our listeners could get it and send them in.  Uh-huh.  But I was playing the game last night.  I was listening to The Rock Station.  They were doing Slow Ride by Fogcat.  And right after the song, they had a fake commercial for the Glory Hole theme park.  Yeah.  It was beyond hilarious.  Glory Hole.  Yay.  And so wrong.  Daddy, what's that hole in front of us for?  It was unbelievable.  You've got to hear this thing.  So we've got to get a copy of some of these fake commercials in the new GTA San Andreas game. 
[03:07:30]  And can I raise a point that you guys tell me?  I'm watching TV right now.  On Fox, it's 269 to 242 in favor of Bush electoral.  On my left is CNN, 254 to 252 Bush.  Yeah.  It is amazing how the media, whatever side you're on, is so goddamn slanted.  All of them.  Well, Fox is so pro-Bush, they've given, not only given Bush more states, but they've taken away some of Kerry's states.  Yeah.  They actually gave him some Republican points in the 2008 election. 
[03:08:00]  Can Fox relax?  All right.  Ridiculous.  Well, we've got to talk about the pirate next.  Arr!  And we might have time today to do some Tony Danza applause breaks.  We haven't done that yet.  Oh, man.  I've missed those.  Has he been doing?  Applausing?  Applauding?  Applauding.  I know.  I caused a Voss moment.  He said that to me.  Applauding?  Yeah, he did.  They were applauding during my act.  I'm like, what?  If that means yelling, boo, shut up.  He's right.  He kept saying, applauding.  That doesn't mean clapping. 
[03:08:30]  You know, he should be in the next Stoner Spelling Bee.  Completely sober.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I'd love to see him try to spell.  That would be hilarious.  I'm the worst speller, though.  I use spellcheck, but as far as trying to spell by myself, just horrible.  It's one of those things.  I just can't work it out.  I can't sound it out.  Phonetically.  P-H-O-E.  But at least I know what the words mean.  I think I know how to use them properly.  Voss is like, hey, I had a tortilla the other night. 
[03:09:00]  You said tortilla.  Tortillia.  That's the word he used.  Tortillia.  And you ever have one of those lean-cazines?  Lean-cazine.  Lean-cazine.  You blithering idiot.  Oh, he didn't know that UI makes a whoosh sound.  Lean-cazine.  Yeah, I have a lean cousin.  And a fat one.  All right.  As we go to break, there's fag talk.  Ah.  This program funded by the British Arts Foundation. 
[03:09:30]  Hello and welcome to Fag Talk, the show where we talk about fags or as they call them in America, cigarettes.  Let's not waste any more time.  Let's bring up Bob the Fag Man.  Thank you very much.  We've got a problem.  Yes, I've heard.  We've been cancelled in America.  Right.  Whoa.  No, I know.  But no, we're still beyond right here in England.  I don't understand the problem with the Americans and this show.  Well, apparently what has happened is we've got thousands and thousands of cars and letters 
[03:10:00]  from people who are very angry about the content of the show.  We don't know why.  Maybe there's smoking laws or something, you know?  Americans are very touchy when it comes to fags, I guess.  I guess so.  I mean, you know, we come on here, suck a good fag or two, and they get all defensive.  I can't figure out why that's so offensive to Americans, but, well, nonetheless.  Nonetheless, we're just doing our job.  And thank you so much for being here.  Join us again next time right here in London only, not in America. 
[03:10:30]  We're sorry.  Goodbye to all of you in America.  Goodbye in America to the people who did enjoy the show.  Bye-bye from Fag Talk.  I was walking down the street, and some construction guy was shouting at me,  Hey, show me your cans!  So I did.  And he plummeted 17 floors and was impaled on a forklift.  But my tits looked great.  Please.  Wow responsibly.  A public service announcement of the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[03:11:00]  See, I tried boxing for a little while and shit.  Yeah, I tried everything to get some pussy.  Ladies, y'all don't know.  Y'all got heaven between the legs.  Y'all probably do know.  Y'all got your own private ATM machine.  Dick go in, money come out.  If there's a broke woman in here, something wrong with your dumb ass. 
[03:11:30]  Because if you're a woman, there ain't no need for you to ever be broke.  Especially when you got what a nigga need.  Take me out your motherfucking puns.  You know, you see a woman walk around complaining, saying, I ain't got nothing, I don't want shit.  What's wrong with your pussy?  It's my first question. 
[03:12:00]  Well, it's exciting, you know, being in the show business.  It's exciting, you know.  I like going home because I can show off when I go home.  But some brothers break my face.  Nigga, you ain't shit.  You wasn't shit when you was here.  I seen you do that shit on us.  That's the same shit you do around the pool, nigga.  It ain't nothing.  Let me have a dollar. 
[03:12:30]  You owe me that.  And there's always some girl when you go home and you're home, and you know you ain't sending that girl no money for that baby.  Know that's your baby, don't you?  Look just like you.  You're going to see the baby, blonde, blue hair.  Blonde, blue hair.  It's a terrible baby.

[03:14:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  With Jimmy Norton helping us out, obviously, every single day.  Why do I have so much porno in front of me?  Did you get all these?  I did.  Not really.  I think so, yeah.  They're all nicely stapled together.  Well, it's from Steve.  One is Spring Thomas. 
[03:15:00]  Springthomas.com.  Steve showed me this.  Teen superstar turned black cock queen.  Ooh.  Where is Steve?  He can explain this stuff a lot better than...  What's that website?  LuckyDevil.com?  Wait, which one is that now, Ian?  Oh, Spring Thomas.  Spring Thomas?  I gotcha, yeah.  And she seems to...  Yeah, what's the deal with SpringThomas.com?  She's the...  I like her when he starts talking and the music comes up.  Yes?  He's got to stop. 
[03:15:30]  He stops for his theme music.  Spring Thomas.  She is this cute little blonde who gets off on calling the black guy she's having sex with the N-word.  Oh, really?  During the act, yes.  Oh, she shows them as they're tooling her with a foot of a black snake up her ass.  Exactly.  She likes to play plantation.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Turning her vag into an umbrella holder.  Hi, boys.  Welcome back to Spring World.  And this week, guess what?  I get to break in an awesome new Negro named T-Boogie. 
[03:16:00]  Come on.  He's a wonderful colored boy I found on the internet.  That's what she says.  And she's a teen, too?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's this cute chick.  Hot teen.  All these sites have to come up with gimmicks now to retain their memberships.  And they don't care how extreme they get.  You know a lot of these people.  Do you know Spring Thomas?  No, I haven't.  I just found out about that one the other day.  She calls them niggers while they're having sex.  Yes.  Okay.  That's exactly the gimmicks.  Some black guys like that.  Well, I'm sure if you're tooling this girl in the behind, she... 
[03:16:30]  Makes it more...  Yeah.  You know, you bring up a good point, though, because there's so much porn on the internet  now.  How do you distinguish yourself?  Yeah, you've got to get attention on your side.  You've got to come up with all these gimmicks.  Wow.  So that's her deal.  I spend a lot of time...  Do any of them get pissed off while they're doing her?  No.  No.  Not at all.  Not at all.  So it's just...  Obviously, they don't mind.  I'm looking for a new colored man to entertain or just reading fan mail. 
[03:17:00]  Ever Google the phrase BCS?  In the day, for me, it meant black cock...  Sucker?  Sucker, probably.  Sucker, yeah.  BCS?  What happens if you Google BCS?  I don't know.  We'll have to try that.  Give it a try, kids.  All right, so that's springthomas.com.  And then he gave me this Spankings.  Brutal Spankings.  Brutal Spankings.  Another one.  Is it BrutalSpankings.com?  It is BrutalSpankings.com.  Girls who act naughty and like to get spanked. 
[03:17:30]  Instant access pass to our collection of newly added rough spanking videos.  Caitlin.  Caitlin does a little damage to her man's credit card, orders some clothes, jewelry, and other things.  She knows she's been bad, and she likes it.  So she needs to be taught a lesson and spanked by her man.  But watch her scream in pleasure as her man takes his palm to her ass and makes her promise to be a good girl.  Yeah, it's just another one of these niche little sites.  It used to be, you got on the internet, and if you could download a picture of a nude woman, you were getting porno. 
[03:18:00]  That was good enough.  And then it got to the videos where, you know, you got videos of nude women.  And then sex acts, and now it's just gotten where...  Out of control.  It's out of control.  They have so much competition because there's so many people entering the business that, or at least at one point, a couple years ago,  there were so many people entering the business that it got flooded, like anything.  So they have to come up with new ways to retain the membership. 
[03:18:30]  And they don't care how violent they have to get, how nasty they have to get, or how genre-specific they have to get.  She spilled my jizzle.  And what about crack whore confessions?  That's by far the weirdest one I've seen yet.  I mean, they're honest-to-God crack whores.  Crack whores.  That this guy...  Yeah, they got that look in their eyes.  I've been emailing back and forth with the guy who runs it for about a week now, a week or two, and he claims it's all legit.  Wow.  Claims it's all legit, says he just goes and interviews...  Well, let's get him on the phone. 
[03:19:00]  He claims he needs 24 hours notice, and we just started doing this today, so he's fast asleep right now.  All right, well, we'll get the guy that's running the crack whore confessions website.  Thank you.  Vicky is a street-walking ghetto queen.  There's no shame in her game.  Her whole family knows that she's a trick-ass hoe.  She loves sucking off her tricks to get a face full of hot...  Yeah.  Sploogee.  Vicky even gives poontang to the po-po to stay out the pan.  Out the pan.  Is po-po police?  I think so. 
[03:19:30]  All right.  This is great.  Hear the shocking story of her getting ravaged as a virgin and being knocked up, and later how she was impregnated by her cousin.  Watch as just the thought of her pussy draining some balls makes her squeal with delight.  Oh.  Oh, look at that.  Something to look forward to, Anthony.  I'm not getting much for BCS.  Yeah, it's garbage.  I'm getting British Computer Society.  Sexy.  That's sexy.  Bowl Championship Series.  Uh-huh. 
[03:20:00]  British Computer Society again.  British Cardiac Society.  British Cardiac Society.  That's sexy.  I've got to get my heart on.  Get it?  Get it?  Yes, yes.  Learning about the old ticker, then.  Wonderful.  Yeah, that's interesting.  Nope.  Black.  Yeah.  Obviously, the big story today is the election.  They're still not calling it, which is so stupid.  But besides that, there was one other story that piqued our interest in the newspaper today. 
[03:20:30]  Uh-huh.  And it was a guy, David Nash, who decided that he needed-  David Nash.  He wanted to take over-  Marvin's brother.  He wanted to take over Governor's Island here in New York City.  Marvin Nash.  Who's that?  I don't know.  Marvin Nash from Reservoir Dogs.  Oh, wow.  The cop that got his ear cut off.  Remember?  Oh, my God.  Wow.  What's your name?  Marvin.  Marvin Nash. 
[03:21:00]  Isn't that great?  Wow.  One of the best scenes ever, by the way.  Ever.  Hey.  Hello.  You hear me?  Stuck in the middle with you.  Hello.  We talked into the guy's cut off here.  What an animal.  How great was-  You hear Jay Moore do Chris Penn?  Oh, yeah.  That's really good.  That's very good.  Who'd he steal that impression from?  Oh, we love the Jay Moore.  Bop!  Now it's mine.  Wait, that's-  Turn this up, bro.  There it is. 
[03:21:30]  You're gonna play it.  Play it.  Yeah.  Play it, man!  Sound off like you got a pair.  I don't care what you know or what you don't know.  I'm gonna torture you anyway.  No.  No, come on.  He was terrifying in that.  Dancing?  He dances over the-  Straight razor.  Oh, fuck.  Now I'll get down the stairs.  Oh, that's horrible.  Need some clips from that movie, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:22:00]  Oh.  Yeah.  That's good.  He's moving his head back and forth.  Trying to keep him from cutting his ear off.  Oh.  No, don't burn me.  Don't burn me.  Oh, my God.  That's right.  No, please.  I got kids.  Don't burn me.  He poured gas on him. 
[03:22:30]  He poured gas.  He was ready to burn him up.  Fantastic.  And as the guy's pleading for his life, he's standing there away from him with the lighter  and just going, you done?  You done?  You finished?  You done?  Like, he's not listening to him.  He didn't care.  Great movie.  Please don't burn me.  Don't burn me?  The creepiest part of that movie is when he leaves and goes back outside and you don't  know.  He got the gas can out of the car.  And then the music, you don't hear the music from the streets.  Do you hear birds tweeting and children playing?  Yeah, yeah.  And children playing.  That is so creepy.  Then he walks back into that house of horrors. 
[03:23:00]  Don't burn me.  Don't burn me.  He was going to burn him alive.  Yeah.  It's an animal.  I loved it.  Yeah, we need clips from Reservoir Dogs.  Oh, God.  Don't burn me.  Oh, God.  Marvin Nash.  All right.  Well, listen to this story, man.  David Nash.  He wanted to take over Governor's Island here in New York City.  And you know what?  We had a listener calls yesterday.  They saw this going down and we thought, stop. 
[03:23:30]  You know, cut it out.  They saw this guy swimming to Governor's Island.  What's the whole Governor's Island?  On top of things.  What's the Governor's Island thing?  It's an uninhabited island?  Yes, it's the...  What does go on in there?  I have no idea.  That's not the one with the Statue of Liberty, is it?  No, the Ellis Island is one.  The Statue of Liberty.  No, Governor's Island.  It's a petaculums.  Gubernatorial Island.  It's good.  There's little huts there.  There's a fat guy and a little buddy. 
[03:24:00]  No?  There's really nothing going on on Governor's Island, but someone help us out.  What's the deal?  The government owns the island, obviously.  Do they do research on monkeys on this island?  That would be interesting.  How to get pepper spray out of their eyes?  I didn't say it.  He did.  Is it like a Jurassic Park type island?  What goes on there?  New York.  Governor's Island.  What is this guy talking about?  All right, you look up Governor's Island.  I'm going to go to the phones.  Oh, there's stuff on there.  Justin, what's up? 
[03:24:30]  Yeah.  Hey.  What up?  Here it is.  In early 2003, Governor's Island was returned to the public after two centuries of restricted  military use when the federal government transferred the island to the city and state of New York  and the National Parks Service.  So up until last year, it was a military place.  Okay.  And now it's just like a park?  Now it's being given over to the city and I guess they're going to turn it into something.  It's open to the public.  All right.  Let's say hi to Joe.  Joe, what's up? 
[03:25:00]  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  How do you do, Joe?  Excellent day today.  Yeah, we're having fun.  What do you got, bro?  I just want to say you guys are fucking awesome.  Thank you, my awesome friend.  Thank you, Joe.  We are spreading the virus out here and today's show is just the greatest fucking ever.  You find the room comfortable, do you?  No complaints.  No complaints.  I love the reservoir dogs thing.  This could be a Coast Guard base.  Thanks, Joe.  Bye, Joe.  Someone's saying it's like the island of Dr. Moreau. 
[03:25:30]  I don't think it is.  He cut my ear off.  Yo, B.  What's up, man, my nigga?  We can fucking curse on everything now, right, thugs?  That's right.  You can curse.  Oh, it's Old Dirty.  I love this satellite shit, dog.  I got to get up on the satellite.  Yeah, this is our old pal, Old Dirty.  Old D.  What's up, Dirty?  What's up, man, yo?  What's good, my nigga?  What's up, kid?  Nothing, bro.  What's up?  What's up?  What you doing for a living?  What happened?  What you doing for a living? 
[03:26:00]  What happened?  I'm doing a little of this and a little of that.  Yeah.  Where have you been for the last two years?  Everyone knows where we've been.  Well, you know, I was homeless for a couple of months.  You were homeless?  You were?  Why?  Yeah, yeah, yo.  Yeah, I had a little beef up in the crib, you know what I'm saying?  So I had to bolt.  I was a fugitive.  This shit from justice.  All right, what happened?  Your old lady kicked you out?  Nah, nah, nah, old lady.  I ain't got no old lady.  I'm old enough.  And I had a fight with my bro, you know?  So I broke his nose, and then he pressed charges on me, and then I was on the run. 
[03:26:30]  Wait, that's your twin brother, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, old dirty has a twin brother that looks exactly like him.  I have a photo of both of them.  But old dirty's brother is very responsible, has a normal life, relatively speaking, a nice  job and all that.  And old dirty makes his money on the street, let's just say, right?  Yes, sir.  All right, so you broke your brother's nose?  Yeah, yeah, so then, you know, he went to the hospital, and of course, it was like,  oh, we're going to have to press your charges, whatever this and that. 
[03:27:00]  So I was supposed to turn myself in, but I didn't, and I broke out.  And then I was going into the coffee shop one day, I was getting coffee and a donut, and  I saw the Warren Squad cop right there, blah, and they ran up on the block and everything,  and I ran down the train, and I was like, oh, my God, I hope the train's waiting for  me right there, and it was there with the doors open, blah, went to the next station,  and jumped on the express, and I was chilling in Coney Island for like three or four days.  Where were you living in Coney Island?  Nah, I was out there on the wharf catching fish with this Puerto Rican cat.  It wasn't us, it was them, the warriors. 
[03:27:30]  It's on Coney on the beach.  Why did you break your brother's nose?  Wow.  Riffs.  Wow, you were on the run.  I was on the run, son.  Sorry, old dirty.  Sorry about that, old dirty.  Working your way back to Coney.  That's a classic.  You're always in it.  You're always in the shit, O.D. 
[03:28:00]  You're always in trouble.  So what?  You had no place to live?  Where did you sleep?  I was sleeping in my sister's truck.  I found a nice bench over here by the train station.  I claimed that.  This homeless guy tried to take my bench.  I was like, nah, I ain't having it.  How do you claim a bench?  Like you just get on it.  You pee on it, O.P.  It's like the wild.  You got to mark, yeah, it's like the place of the Serengeti, kid.  You got to mark your turf.  Right.  Have you and your brother patched up?  Yeah, yeah, man.  It's like he was drunk, you know what I'm saying? 
[03:28:30]  And the brother has the propensity of trying to fight me every time he's inebriated.  You know what I mean?  He gets a little drunk, huh?  Yeah, yeah, so I was trying to put the brother to bed, and, you know, he just flipped out, son.  Why does he want to fight you?  Because you're kind of the tougher of the two, and he resents the fact that...  Yeah, I don't know, Duke.  It's like I get the feeling like the brother thinks he was living in my shadow, you know what I'm saying?  Because I got a certain reputation in the streets.  I got my street smarts.  I got my fame.  You know, I was a graffiti artist.  You know, I'm the man people come to to move things, to do things, you know? 
[03:29:00]  When it can't be done, you know, they call on me to get it done, you know what I mean, dogs?  Also, all of a sudden I feel like I'm on a GTA mission when I listen to OD talk, I know.  I feel like I'm playing GTA.  We love the GTA.  You know what I'm saying?  How about the new one, kid?  That's the one we're talking about.  Have you stolen a PlayStation yet?  Son, I've been having PlayStations.  I got Xboxes, too.  Xboxes.  I need a PlayStation, too.  You need a...  Who's that, my nigga, Norton?  Yeah.  Yo, my nigga, Norton was too much for his last comic standing, son. 
[03:29:30]  I love that show, kid.  It rocked his time, right?  Yeah, thanks, man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We kind of knew I wouldn't be able to go through.  Would you pass by the electronics store window to watch it at night?  So you're going to steal some of the XM satellites or what?  Yo, man, if I...  Yo, satellite, Pete.  That's the next...  That's the new frontier, my nigga.  We are the pioneers.  You're talking to the pioneers of XM Satellite Radio.  You know what I'm saying, my nigga, Norton?  Yo, what's good, Gar?  I'm very good, thank you. 
[03:30:00]  You didn't always...  I was here the whole time.  What happened?  I was here the whole time.  What happened?  That is the funniest gag.  It's like, I can't...  Excuse me, I didn't catch what you said.  No, it's, what happened?  What happened?  Nah, it's good to hear you brothers back on the air, man.  It was about time, B.  Word up.  Word up.  You're going to have to pop on in.  Yo, son, I'm a Dominican millionaire, dogs.  What happened?  I got to explain to you, my brother.  That means three pairs of socks?  Four, no, and four. 
[03:30:30]  What do you mean you're a millionaire?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got into a little money.  Really?  A pyramid scheme?  Hell no, I've been done that.  Well, how do you get money?  Man, I can't really divulge the details on the air right now, you know what I mean?  Because we can't vouch for the integrity.  We don't know where the satellite is bumping the signal to, you know what I mean, dogs?  Yeah, you're all into the conspiracy thing.  I forgot about that.  Yo, word up, son.  I got mad info, son. 
[03:31:00]  But what is it?  What about the whole thing that's going on in D.C.?  You mean the election?  Yo, I mean, brothers went out to vote and everything, but all we're looking at is the electoral college, B.  That's all they're worried about, the electoral vote.  So if the brother got 250 and change, and this brother got 260 and change, I mean, why does the popular vote fit into the whole scheme of things, my brother?  You know, this is the commentary you just don't hear on CNN, and it's missed. 
[03:31:30]  I think there's a place for it.  Yeah, I think you need a seat right next to Tom Brokaw.  I think this would be a really good...  I have a question.  That's right, O.D.  You know, I don't understand if this nigga has 260 and change, and my nigga over here has 250 and change, where does the popular vote fit in?  Let's go to the ice rink and find out.  So you think it's a conspiracy?  Yo, man, I mean, yo, it's obvious that Bush Jr. ain't them head niggas in charge. 
[03:32:00]  Definitely Cheney's the one running the show, B.  Well, let's go to my nigga Tim Russett.  He's sitting next to me.  Tim Russett, I saw him this morning, B.  You're in Ghetto Plaza.  Democracy Plaza.  I'm like, why?  Give me a break.  You know what, though, Old Dirty?  Let me know.  Yeah, Bush won the vote, too, though.  Yeah, he got the popular vote, and he's winning the electoral college votes.  It's done.  It's done.  Bush is in for four more years.  Yeah, we're stuck with him again. 
[03:32:30]  I also think, dude, that the...  Yeah, they just showed it, matter of fact.  Bush has about four million more votes than Kerry at this point.  Isn't that so they have to pay attention to other states, too?  Like, if it was only popular vote, they'd spend so much time in New York and California.  I think that's to give other states a certain amount of...  A voice.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like the smallest states.  It's all about giving everyone a voice.  That's what the electoral college is more about.  Yeah.  So, all right, how'd you come into this money?  Oh, no, yo, you remember a couple of years ago when I had a little thing on, you know,  I lost my job and I did the 30 days and all that? 
[03:33:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm breaking out of character, so I gotta be serious.  Oh, didn't he sue the state for false arrest or something?  It's made on the sue aid, as they...  It's made on the sue aid.  You actually got paper in your pocket.  Yeah, I got some papers, kid.  What up?  Or is this imaginary millions?  No, no, no, no.  This ain't Monopoly money, my brother.  This is the real legitimate, the big faces, dog.  JC from Long Island saying a Dominican millionaire means you have two Toyota Camrys, one with  a new rim on it.  Yeah. 
[03:33:30]  Nice.  You know what I mean, dog?  So, what are you going to do with all your millions?  And Huddy from Philly wants to know what the electrical college is that you're talking  about.  Wow.  Well, I'm going to...  I have a...  I already have a financial plan, scheme dot and everything.  Yeah.  So, you know, I'm going to invest, well, most of it, but, you know, I'm going to buy me  a little truck.  But where'd you get the money?  Oh, man, I won my suit, my nigga. 
[03:34:00]  You won your lawsuit?  Yeah, I won that.  Now, have you received your money yet?  Yes, I have.  Oh, you have?  Yes.  And what was the amount?  I can't say.  Was it over a million?  Hell no, shit.  Okay.  Was it over 10,000?  Oh, hell yeah.  Between 10 and 100,000?  There you go, dog.  All right.  Somewhere in there.  All right.  Yeah, that's good.  All right.  Do something good with your money, all right?  Hell yeah, my nigga.  What are you buying, drugs?  Hell no.  I suggest online poker. 
[03:34:30]  Online poker.  Ah, online poker, my friend.  Yeah.  Yo, man, I want to...  That was 100 bucks last night in online poker.  I want to come in and discuss some investment strategies, you know what I mean, dogs?  When can I come in, dogs?  We're well prepared for you, trust me.  We got a signed assassin that now works for us.  His name's Master Poe, and he's going to be watching out for you when you come through  the building.  All right.  That's good.  All right.  Remember the phone card controversy?  Yes.  Last time?  Yo, we're done with the phone cards.  Everybody got into the phone card game.  We got a bunch of phone cards, and we thought Old Dirty stole a whole box of them. 
[03:35:00]  Yo, that sucked, man.  We were blaming them for it, and it turned out they were just, like, misplaced because  Eddie put them somewhere.  Yeah.  I put the phone cards somewhere.  All right.  Well, Old Dirty, you got anything else?  No, sir.  Well, leave us with some street slang, man.  We finally learned that you guys updated the money thing, and we're not calling it cheddar  anymore.  We're calling it paper, right?  Yes, it's paper now.  All right.  Give us a couple more before you leave.  Wow.  What can we say?  What can we say?  Hmm.  Man, we got to keep talking so I can come out with it, though.  Well, you did say blah a lot in the beginning, and what was that about? 
[03:35:30]  Well, like, blah.  Yeah.  Like, you know, like, blah.  Yo, I was trying to change the subject.  It's like a period.  That one's bad.  You guys are losing it in the hood.  Blah.  Usually, you guys are good for some good stuff, but I don't know, man.  Come on, man.  We've been living under bush for four years, and now we got four more.  What's the latest trend in the ghetto?  In the ghetto?  Yeah.  Motherfuckers is putting 20-inch spinners on 86 Explorers.  That's what the trend is. 
[03:36:00]  It looks ridiculous.  The rims cost more than a fucking truck.  Come on, son.  All right, son.  I'm going to put the bling on a 4G hoopty.  Yeah.  All right?  I hear you.  All right.  Give us one more slang.  Nothing?  Nothing.  Nothing, dogs.  All right.  If you remember, call us back, okay?  Yes, baby.  What?  Yeah, we're going to put you on hold.  All right.  Peace.  Bye, O.D.  Ben's running the show, and he wants to talk to you.  There goes our old friend, old dirty.  Opie, Wall Street, ecstatic about Bush being in, I guess.  The Dow up 152 points, and it just opened. 
[03:36:30]  Any of our stocks open?  Any of our stocks going up?  I hope not.  I heavied up on options again on Google.  Are you insane?  I hope it works out.  Why are they so happy that he's in?  Like, why?  Everyone says how bad it is for the economy.  Because they don't like change down at the stock market.  Oh, it's moving.  Down there on Wall Street.  Oh, you might have to do the last half hour of the show.  For yourself.  Why?  Google up five bucks.  I bought in.  I'm going to have to punch out. 
[03:37:00]  It's almost going to hit 200 bucks.  What are you going to share?  Are you going to punch out before the end of the show?  Yeah, but I've got to keep an eye on it.  All right, keep an eye on it.  We're going to take a break, and we'll get to the pirate story next.  Come on.  Hey, he was involved in a seven-car pileup.  There was blood and carnage everywhere.  But my tits looked great.  Please.  Wow, responsibly.  A public service announcement of the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[03:37:30]  May I help you?  Yes, I'm calling about the job.  Yes.  Are you currently working downtown?  Yes.  Well, actually, I was cutting hair uptown.  And now I want to get there, because I see what you say about the Wall Street thing there.  Right.  Now, I could probably bring in a lot of clientele.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll be interviewing all next week.  Okay, great.  Listen, what about styles?  What kind of styles are you looking for?  Well, we do everything. 
[03:38:00]  Right.  All right, look.  I'm pretty far out there.  I've done some wacky shit.  I used to shoot people's heads up with Novocaine and carved roofs in their head.  I mean, if that's too far-fetched, you got to let me know.  Well, first of all, we work on Wall Street, so the people here aren't going to be that wild.  Right, right.  I did a lot of work in the village, man.  I'm a fucking...  I'm crazy.  I'm a nut job.  One time I gave this guy a haircut.  He didn't like it.  He kicked my fucking ass all over.  If you want to come in one day next week, I'll be glad to see you. 
[03:38:30]  Right, right.  As long as my appearance wouldn't bother you.  I'm carved from head to toe.  I'm a lunatic.  But I'll come in, and we'll shoot this shit, and you can see some of my work.  Okay?  No problem.  Do you want us to find him one day next week?  Whatever's fine.  Listen, I'll bring my children down.  I carved the shit out of their heads, too.  But it looks good.  It looks good.  You never heard of that before?  Excuse me?  Did you ever hear of that procedure?  Yes.  Is that something, or what? 
[03:39:00]  Oh, I don't think anyone down here would want that done, so I wouldn't worry about it too much.  All right, great.  Well, I'll come down, and you can show me your shit, and maybe kick me around the office a little,  and we'll throw ideas back and forth, okay?  All right, you want my address?  Yes, please.  All right, we're at the Trade Center.  Oh, holy shit.  All right.  Okay, I'll see you then.  I'll see you, what, Wednesday?  Next week?  Wednesday, it's fine.  Okay.  All right, I'm so happy.

They're all over the same.  By Madison Square Garden, they're over here on 6th.  What are they protesting? 
[03:43:00]  They're protesting some regime.  Falun Gong.  You ever see that?  But they're all in place, and one of them looks like he's hanging.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like tortures and stuff.  So there are awful pictures on these poster boards.  So as you drive by, and you're in traffic because of them, you have to look at these awful pictures of these bloodied, tortured Asians that are hanging, throat slit, punched, their eyes are all puffed up.  Are we going to get one of those cool protesters where they light themselves on fire?  Ooh, that's a treat. 
[03:43:30]  Do you ever see them?  If you believe in your cause, let's go, guys.  Let yourself on fire.  What?  No, do you ever see them?  Now that he said that, I've been on 7th Avenue, and there actually will be a guy in a cage, a live guy in a cage with his arms up like he's chained to the top corners of the cage.  They actually have live people reenacting these torture scenes.  Isn't that great?  I didn't know what that was for.  I wasn't able to make a left turn off of 6th Avenue one day because they were just like did this Hands Across America thing up 6th Avenue and blocked every street.  So I couldn't even make a turn. 
[03:44:00]  No, at that point.  I understand people are being tortured, killed, and having horrible deaths, but I have to make a left turn.  Yeah, at that point, you've got to just keep going.  Yeah.  You've got to keep going.  If you're stupid enough to not let go as the car's trying to, you know, cut through your line there.  I didn't even try.  So we'll have Chinese audio tomorrow on the show?  Oh, yes.  That's a good line, actually.  You know, they stopped serving cat in China, by the way, too.  I read that little tidbit in the news.  Why?  Because of SARS.  They found out that that was spreading a lot of SARS by them eating cat. 
[03:44:30]  So cat is off the menu now in China.  They're trying to get people to stop eating cat.  Isn't that something?  That they were anyway.  It's 2004.  Have a hamburger.  They're eating cats.  And why aren't they eating the cats anymore, Anthony?  Oh, Jesus.  What?  Because it was spreading SARS.  SARS?  SARS.  SARS?  SARS.  SARS.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
[03:45:00]  I caught them in vain. 
[03:45:30]  I must have caught it from that chick on the plane with SARS.  It's SARS.  Sickened by SARS, and it really shows.  My right lung exploded and blew out of my nose. 
[03:46:00]  It's SARS.  Chinese gave me SARS.  I am very sick.  Glad I'm not like them.  With their really small height and SARS.  There you have it. 
[03:46:30]  Brother Joe.  It's SARS song.  That might be his finest work.  I don't know.  Dry Vaginas is pretty good.  I like the SARS song.  SARS and Taylor singing DMX.  That's a good one.  We'll play another one before the end of the show.  I like the Olsen twins one, too.  Anyway, Anthony.  Let's really try to concentrate now and try to get through this stupid story about this guy that tried to take over Governor's Island here in New York.  A man tries to seize Governor's Island. 
[03:47:00]  Listen to this, man.  An emotionally disturbed man in a wetsuit attempted to seize Governor's Island yesterday by hoisting a pirate flag.  Arr, matey.  Sparking a massive response by cops in the Coast Guard.  Why, they thought he might have been a terrorist?  Yeah, let's calm down with the massive response.  I mean, I think everyone knows what this was about.  This wasn't a terrorist attack.  It was a psychopath.  This is something that years ago, before 9-11, would have been handled by a couple of parks police. 
[03:47:30]  Yeah.  Would have gone over and gone,  Guy, what are you doing?  I'm a pirate.  Okay.  Alright, hoist your flag down here and we're gonna just take you in and talk to you and maybe take you to Bellevue or something like that.  Now, choppers, Coast Guard boats, 50 cals, police, National Guard.  You can't even be a kook anymore and have a little fun.  Did I ever tell you the story of how I ate it?  I got a good pirate story.  How you ate it?  You better be a little more clear.  Well, I got a good pirate story. 
[03:48:00]  The Pirates of the Caribbean comes out, right?  Yo-ho, yo-ho.  And it was the first day that the DVD is available.  Yar.  Alright.  I'm online and I'm getting the movie for my niece.  Aye.  For her birthday or something, whatever.  Arr.  Actually, I watched the movie.  I liked it.  We know it was for you.  Go ahead.  No, it really wasn't, but...  Continue, you scallywag!  So I'm online and I go up to the counter to pay for this.  Arr.  It was at Tower Records.  And the guy behind the counter, I swear this is a true story, is wearing an eye patch.  Arr. 
[03:48:30]  And I go...  Oh no, stop it.  I swear to God.  Oh, you didn't.  I swear.  I go...  You didn't.  You didn't catch it because it's, you know, the movie came out today.  Oh my God, this is really cool.  You don't!  I swear to you.  Because it was the day the movie was released.  He looks at me and is like, excuse me?  And I went, it's cool that you...  And I went, oh my God.  Oh no.  When's the baby do?  Exactly.  That's the Brian Regan bit.  Exactly.  Walking up to a woman and asking, hey, when's the baby do?  You can feel the tension on the line. 
[03:49:00]  Everyone was like, oh my God.  I can't believe you just said that.  Oh my God.  And this guy was just so pissed off.  He throws the receipt at me and my credit card back.  And I was like, but I just thought...  You know, I'm trying to explain and I can't.  Hey, they gave out hook hands.  That's nice.  Great for the movie, right?  Dude, I mean, the coincidence though.  It's the day the DVD is released and the guy has a freaking patch on it.  That is kind of coincidental.  And he's behind the cash register.  He should have worked it with a parrot on his shoulder.  It was one of those things you just feel inside like, oh my... 
[03:49:30]  You just want to be removed from the situation.  You want to be able to punch out of the situation.  It was.  In the ejector seat.  Oh, it was awful, man.  It was absolutely awful.  All right.  So, yes.  Sparking a massive response by cops and the Coast Guard.  Massive.  Put your weapons down and go in peace.  David Nash said.  He said that to the cops?  Yeah, he's from Virginia.  So, he's telling all these people to drop their weapons.  Yeah, here's the massive response by the cops and the Coast Guard.  You know, as this guy's putting his pirate flag in the middle of Governor's Island. 
[03:50:00]  Arr!  And he puts his hands up and goes, put your weapons down and go in peace.  Go in peace.  He told a half dozen Harbor Patrol cops who nabbed him.  To which they opened fire on him and left him dead.  That would have been a good ending.  His face covered with black makeup.  Nash claimed to have swam to the island, even though he was dry when cops found him.  There was no oxygen tank or mask with his wetsuit either, Anthony.  So, he said he swam, but he didn't. 
[03:50:30]  How did he get there?  We don't know yet.  It's a mystery.  Nash told the Daily News he was trying to seize Governor's Island for the Blue Tulip Party.  The Blue Tulip Party?  Yeah.  Any info on this party?  Well, Nash says it's a political organization that he started.  And he mumbled, it's about Indians and reparations as his motives for trespassing.  So, why was he in blackface?  I don't know.  Yeah, good point.  The guy's trying a little bit of everything.  Yeah, good point.  The Unemployed Man, no surprise there, called the Opie and Anthony show the next day and 
[03:51:00]  played Stoner Spelling Bee.  The Unemployed Man was brought back to Pier 11 near Wall Street at 9am and taken by ambulance  to...  Bellevue.  There you go, where they bring all the...  The Bellevue Follies.  The kooks.  I hate this place.  I've been here seven years.  Medication doesn't work.  Nothing works here.  I've been here seven years.  I hate this place.  When are we gonna get that clip again? 
[03:51:30]  We need that clip too.  Seven years.  We need that clip too.  Oh, you ain't gonna find it, that's for sure.  Rick took everything with him.  Yeah, let's just be straight there.  Rick took everything.  Rick Delgado took everything.  Our old producer took everything with him.  It was stuff I collected in all my years of radio and it's all gone.  At a habit.  We have to start from the beginning.  At a habit.  I'm writing him a check every month.  He gave me like...  He took half our stuff.  He gave me like six boxes of our old stuff back and I'm assuming it was all the good  stuff.  It's not the good stuff. 
[03:52:00]  Not the stuff we could use.  No, it was all stuff that we collected for the Opie and Anthony show.  Not so he could, you know, play it on another radio show somewhere.  He gave back all the stuff that we had done on the air.  All the stuff that we're not allowed to play because it's infinity owned.  So like shows, he gave us back all that stuff.  But the stuff he didn't give us is the stuff we could play on the air.  Like those clips and the soundboard clips.  Our porno music CD and all my comedy CDs.  Everything.  All that stuff.  An uncut penis.  We took it all.  Yes, Eric.  How am I supposed to talk with Eric? 
[03:52:30]  Yes, Eric.  We've been trying since August to get that Bellevue special.  HBO reran it once and nobody had a tape of it.  All right.  We're still trying.  It's the best we can do.  Thank you.  That was very informative.  This guy, by the way, did come out and say why he did this to me.  Yeah, boy.  Is this another plug for Sacramento?  Wow.  Oh, my God.  I can see it on your face.  Oh, boy.  Am I right?  What?  You were going there, right?  Going where?  At least be honest.  Did I get you?  About plugging Sacramento this Friday and Saturday at the punchline?  Yeah. 
[03:53:00]  You got me.  Okay, good.  Sorry.  His move to commandeer Governor's Island, Anthony, was first noticed when workers saw  the pirate flag hoisted at 6.40 a.m. on the flagpole on the center of the island.  I love this guy.  Pirates be here!  Arr!  They all ran away.  A skull at the flag's center had a painted bullet hole between a set of red eyes.  A police spokesman said it wasn't clear how long Nash had been on the island or where  he had landed.  Landed.  Nash's mother, Pat, told the news that her son was an aspiring artist who suffered from 
[03:53:30]  psychological problems and took medication.  No.  He was in New York to visit some museums and the mom didn't hear from him for a week  and a half.  When did they...  Oh, can I ask when they realized that Nash had the problems?  Was it when he realized that the little niece never got any older?  Okay.  Hold on.  I'm thinking.  I'm just wondering if that's when Nash realized...  Someone out there's got it.  I'm kind of...  Well, you know what it was?  After he pushed his stupid desk out the window and blamed the non-existent roommate. 
[03:54:00]  Oh, okay.  There you go.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Very good.  With...  What's his name there from...  Beautiful Mind.  Russell Crowe.  Yeah, Beautiful Mind.  Fantastic performance.  Spill from Jersey says he wonders if Nash really said,  But your weapons down.  To the police.  I didn't say put, did I?  I've been working on that.  Oh, he's wondering if Nash said but.  I've been working on the put, but thing after hours.  I've got to put it down.  I've been practicing.  Numerous people are chiming in with that joke.  I'll be on instant feedback. 
[03:54:30]  I'm so glad they don't miss a thing.  Boot your weapons down.  Did I really say boot again?  I don't know.  I never noticed.  Put.  Put.  Put.  Put it down.  She said her son's antics may have been timed to the election day, Anthony.  Nash had proclaimed himself a presidential candidate in 2000  and was the only known member of the Blue Tulip Party.  The Blue Tulip?  Yeah.  The only known member.  The only known member.  So many secret members though.  Even fellow wackos don't want to be part of the Blue Tulip Party. 
[03:55:00]  No.  Something for me to worry about again, said the mother after learning about her son's stunt.  I want to fund this guy's campaign in 2008.  He's a classic.  Ah, why not?  The Blue Tulip.  The Blue Tulip Party.  Hey, you got some attention.  You sure did.  Look at that, didn't he?  Poor mother.  Don't you feel bad for parents of like, retarded people?  Yep.  Morons.  Yeah.  At least with retarded kids that look retarded, people can just go, ah, and then not invite  you over.  But he... 
[03:55:30]  You know, looking like a normal person.  You know, I don't feel like playing What Do We Learn Today.  No?  Nah.  Didn't learn anything?  You don't think the show was educational enough?  Marion got the boon box, right?  The boon box, yes.  Do we have time to play Dry Vagina?  Yes.  It's one minute.  Yes.  How much time we left in the show?  How much time left in the show?  Maybe I shouldn't hold my mouth as I try to talk.  Do you think that parents, like when they bring home, like when they...  You know when people show you a baby, you go, oh, look how cute he is.  Aw.  Do you think when the kid's retarded, they go, oh, well, he's got hands. 
[03:56:00]  Aw, dude.  You say that with regular kids, regular people's babies.  No, but I mean...  There's a lot of ugly babies out there.  You're right, but you don't look and go, wow, that's going to need some extra love in  that household.  Everyone's baby is the cutest baby and also always the smartest.  And the more...  Do you know my baby is so smart and...  No, they're not.  All right, can we get out of here?  I want to play Dry Vagina.  Please.  We can play it right now?  Yeah.  And then we'll have to hear that I love New York crap again?  Yeah, all right.  Hey, thanks, man. 
[03:56:30]  It was a good show, right?  I think so, too.  Have fun.  And we'll do it again tomorrow.  Love you, boo-boo.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. 
[03:57:00]  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Go get some bad to look back, you'll look for a star!  Oh, you stink, baby!  How do you propose we get an entire nation to sit through a massive victory?  The Opinality Show. 
[03:57:30]  New York City! 
[03:58:00]  It has been turned into our collection agency for the amount of $43.  You've got to be kidding me.  No, sir, I'm not.  No, no, no, hold on, let me tell you something.  That doctor had me come in about six months ago for a full physical,  put me there in his little examination room, told me to get naked.  I'm sitting there by the next door for about 20 minutes,  and finally he comes in and says, put this gown on. 
[03:58:30]  I tell you, this gown had lace on it.  And he told me, finally, he said, well, something I prompted him.  I told him to bend over, so I'm thinking, hey, he's a doctor.  I'm bending over and stuff.  Checking my prostate, turning around, the guy had both hands on my shoulders.  I don't think it's damn bit funny right now.  He's in there laughing at my experience I've gone through.  Sir?  Yeah?  Your medical history is irrelevant, sir.  I'm telling you, he's not getting no money from me.  I went there to get a physical, told me to put a 90 on. 
[03:59:00]  I put, thank God, he took my prostate out,  had both hands on my shoulders and everything.  I can't even look at my wife the same way.  Come out, Bob's cutting the grass next door and I get kind of sexually aroused  and I don't even know which way I'm coming or going.  Do you understand?  Have you talked to them over there?  Have you talked to them?  Yes, I have, sir.  I've talked to their...  Did he ask about me?  No, the doctor's not even involved.  I'm talking to the county department.  I mean, he's still jogging and working out the weights and everything. 
[03:59:30]  I have no idea, sir.  He's getting kind of buffed there for a while.  I think he's lit up a little bit like Brad Pitt.  Sir, sir.  Is your good credit history worth $43?  And a lot of virginity for $43?  Don't worry about that damn $43.  I may better call him up.  If he knew you were calling me right now, he'd probably be pissed  because he don't know that you're...  I'm sure the hell he don't know what this is all about.  Sir, sir.  Your account has been turned over to us.  It leaves our hands and goes into the lawyer's hands.  That's about your boy.  Tell you what, you're about as much pain in the ass that he was.  I'm going to go.  You can screw you, buddy.
