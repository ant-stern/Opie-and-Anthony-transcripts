<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show begins with a profane and enthusiastic introduction from Larry King, expressing his amusement at the show's irreverent style. Opie and Anthony, returning from vacation, launch into a series of misadventures. Opie recounts breaking his Blackberry and destroying his laptop by dropping it, while Anthony shares a picture text from Jim Norton depicting their cleaning lady's feet.  They then discuss an earthquake felt by Opie in the Outer Banks (which Anthony slept through), followed by a detailed account of Opie's five-day power outage on Long Island after Hurricane Irene. Opie describes his frantic search for a generator and his fortuitous interaction with a helpful Twitter user who expedited power restoration to his neighborhood, contrasting the positive experience with the perceived incompetence of LIPA. The hosts criticize the overblown media coverage of Irene's impact on NYC compared to the significant damage on Long Island and New Jersey, with particular criticism aimed at Mayor Bloomberg's response and lamentations over the damage to Sebastian Bach's home and his Kiss memorabilia.  Opie concludes this segment by detailing the disappearance of their food and supplies from their Outer Banks rental after evacuating for the hurricane, suspecting the cleaning crew or inspectors rather than looters, and revealing fraudulent activity on his iPhone account involving name changes and account openings.


The next segment focuses on the hosts' and guests' disastrous vacations.  Opie details a home break-in, expressing anger at the violation rather than the stolen items (which included a half-eaten cake and children's detergent). He recounts a frustrating encounter with a deceitful woman involved in the incident.  Kenny, a frequent caller, then describes his hurricane cruise experience, including intense sea conditions, excessive eating, and hilariously recounting saving an elderly woman from drowning in a jacuzzi.  E-Rock's cruise is also discussed, highlighting his sunburn and his wife's struggles to reach him due to the approaching hurricane.  E-Rock later joins the show, detailing his cruise frustrations, including unexpected expenses and itinerary changes. He also mentions a "sexiest man alive" contest on the ship.


E-Roc continues his cruise story, detailing exorbitant costs for amenities like bottled water.  The hosts relentlessly tease E-Roc about his allegedly dyed hair (using "Sun-In"), a claim he denies. The conversation shifts to celebrity sightings, including a former radio host (later revealed to be Danny Bonaduce) struggling with the ship's stairs, and other celebrities from shows E-Roc's father watched.  E-Rock describes treating his severe sunburn by aggressively peeling his skin with tape, the lack of a midnight buffet, expensive cupcakes, and his successful blackjack run covering his onboard expenses.  Troy Kwan is a guest in the studio during this segment.  Humorous anecdotes about E-Roc's experiences, Kenny's reactions to towel animals, and jokes about Kenny's perceived colorblindness fill this portion of the show.  E-Roc describes a visit to a nude beach in St. Martin, noting his discomfort with the nudity, especially involving teenagers, and mentions spa treatments received on the cruise. The discussion includes details about close plane landings in St. Martin. Uncle Nino and Vinny from Jersey Shore are mentioned as past guests.


A caller named "Euron" recounts his various spa treatments during a cruise: a disappointing couples massage; a facial involving electric wands and gel; and acupuncture that caused pain, numbness, and bleeding.  He also describes a muscle-stimulating treatment with electrodes that caused involuntary muscle contractions.  The hosts interject with jokes and comments. A significant digression occurs involving a picture posted by one of the hosts depicting what was initially thought to be a dead body, a dead horse (later revealed to be alive), and Sam's hair (initially described as dreadlocks, later disputed).  There is also speculation about the Kardashians' relationships. John Sterling's Yankee's home run calls for Jesus Montero are played.  The segment concludes with mentions of upcoming guests, including Emmitt Smith.  No guests were in studio beyond the regular hosts and Sam.


The after-show segment centers around Sam Roberts' birthday and his vacation recounting.  The hosts tease Sam extensively about the length of his vacation story. Opie's fabricated Twitter stories (a dead horse, Sam's dreadlocks, and possibly misleading birthday party information) are discussed.  Sam's newly dyed hair is also heavily teased.  Eric's casino winnings are a source of gossip. Anthony's ongoing identity theft issues are briefly mentioned. Opie's videos showcasing Sam's extensive toy collection (and possible hoarding tendencies) are discussed. Kenny provides a humorous, profane traffic report. The extended bit about Sam's vacation, jokes about his hair, and the running gag about Opie's deceptive tweets are notable moments.  The regular hosts are the only ones in studio.


The final segment opens with a caller calling Sam "very, very gay" in reference to a birthday video. A prank involving a fake dead horse is discussed.  The conversation largely revolves around Sam's extensive toy collection and the challenges of moving it.  The hosts express disappointment with Sam's on-air birthday celebration, complaining that the "bed has been shit all over". They briefly mention future plans, including a video tour of Sam's house and a possible follow-up the next day.  No guests were in studio.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, it's Larry King. What the hell am I doing here?  Wait a minute, you want me to intro the Opie and Anthony show?  You gotta catch it.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM Satellite.  Yeah, oh fuck yeah! This place is insane!  You guys like to cuss on that, man.  Yeah, I think a lot. It's a weird show.  Yes, interesting interviews and of course your phone calls as well.  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to intro it. 
[00:00:30]  This show is so disorganized. Holy shit.  It's so fucking bizarre.  Everybody's not politically correct.  Opie and Anthony were saying that, well then turn off!  God dang Opie and Anthony, you dumbass.  We're experts and we already know this is gonna be great radio, so shut the fuck up.  Where else are you gonna be able to say that and get paid for it?  Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pride that I presented this, by the way, one of the highlights of my career.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  I love it. 
[00:01:00]  Ah, good morning. It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hola!  After two weeks of shitty vacation for me, one shitty week of vacation for Anthony.  Yeah.  Jimmy doesn't take any vacation ever, so I don't even know what he did with his week off.  And now we're here for a shitty week of radio.  That's right!  Now we cap it off with a shitty week of radio.  What a great fucking vacation this has been.  You know, when you're gone for two weeks, you realize, you don't miss this place. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  I didn't have a pep in my step this morning.  No.  Next time I hear that fucking song, it better be before I watch The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.  Really?  You've had it?  During the show, yeah.  You've had it with the ecstasy of gold thing?  I heard ecstasy of gold. I'm like, shut up.  It was a shit.  Hey, welcome. Welcome back.  Did they even know we were gone?  Who knows?  You know, I broke my BlackBerry, which is like the corporate phone I use for email and keeping in touch with this place. 
[00:02:00]  And I realized, without having that phone, nothing changes or nothing happens.  No. Did it affect your life in any way?  Not at all.  Not having your corporate phone.  No, not at all.  Yeah.  I broke that on the first day of vacation. Broke my laptop on the third day of vacation.  Oof.  In anger or accidentally?  No. No anger here, sir.  How'd you break it?  The laptop.  Well, first, the phone.  The phone, I was dropping my sweatpants so I could jump in the pool. 
[00:02:30]  And the pool had a lot of concrete around it.  And I guess it just fucking, I guess the phone threw the sweatpants, hit the wrong way.  Oh.  And then the screen's all like fucked up.  But I could see people are trying to email me, but I just can't see nothing.  Yeah.  And people are texting me.  I have like 20 texts, and I figure that's all the people that were worried about me on vacation because of the dumb hurricane crap.  Yeah.  But I don't know because I can't read the BlackBerry screen.  I know I didn't get one from you, Jimmy.  That's so frustrating.  You got a concerned text from me? 
[00:03:00]  No.  I get a text from Jimmy, and I'm like, ooh, Jimmy's very concerned about me.  This is nice.  Let me see what he says.  And it's a picture of our, we share a cleaning lady.  I turn my cleaning lady on to Jimmy.  Yeah.  So he sends me a picture.  I'm in the middle of like hell, basically, trying to figure out shit.  And Jimmy texts me, and I'm thinking, okay, are you safe?  No, it's a picture of her horrible toes.  Ew.  She's got really bad feet. 
[00:03:30]  Ew.  He sends me a picture in the middle of this hurricane crap I'm dealing with of her one foot that's a skew.  It was a skew?  Oh, yeah, man.  I knew that would make you laugh, though.  I knew that you would see that foot and laugh.  Absolutely, man.  It was such a terrible photo to send.  Yeah, we had some shit going back and forth as far as the earthquake-y thing went, and  then the hurricane, of course, which made everybody's vacation just marvelous.  Well, I told, me and Ann already did an hour of radio, because he got here early and I got 
[00:04:00]  here early, so it's going to sound weird to just repeat all this shit.  Eh, why not?  We do it on a daily basis.  Dick jokes, AIDS.  Did you, let's start with...  You rock fat repeat.  Let's start with the earthquake.  I felt it down in the Outer Banks.  Yeah.  And you said you didn't really feel it, because you were sleeping at the time, right?  I was sleeping through the whole thing.  Did you feel it, Jimmy?  No, I did not.  I was, uh...  There was one point where I thought somebody was in my apartment, and I realized that that  was the noise that I heard, but I wouldn't have known what it was. 
[00:04:30]  What was the noise?  Yeah, hi, Big Daddy.  It was like, yo, motherfucker.  No, I don't remember.  It was just a weird sound.  I can't describe it, but I remember it.  And when I heard what time the earthquake was, I'm like, that's about the same time  I heard, and I actually went out and checked, and there was nobody in the apartment.  I was on a porch, uh, just filming dumb wild horses, because they were eating my car.  They were very close to my car.  It looked like they were eating, whatever.  And I just told Ann, so this is weird, but the whole porch was shaking, and I thought,  because we went on vacation with a couple families and kids and stuff, I thought the kids 
[00:05:00]  were right inside of this window, jumping up and down on a bed.  And I'm like, oh, that's weird.  Why are they jumping up and down on this bed, because they're kind of a little older now?  Then I go in the house, and my father-in-law is like, were you locked out?  Were you trying to get in?  Because he heard the door, like, shaking.  Everyone thinks it's something else ridiculous.  Always, because...  Yeah, it's not an earthquake.  Because we're not from California.  We don't feel earthquakes.  I've never felt it.  Yeah, that's one, right.  I've never felt an earthquake in my life.  You know?  So, then I checked Twitter, or we turned on the TV, and it was an earthquake. 
[00:05:30]  I'm like, fuck, that's what I was feeling out there.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Yeah, I slept through it.  I woke up, I was like, eh.  I saw, like, a chandelier swinging a little bit.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, it was like, but it was after it was over already.  It was just the residual swinging a little bit here and there, but that was it.  The shaking, what I thought was the unstable porch, and, you know, the kids jumping up  and down the bed, it was about 30 seconds.  Is that possible? 
[00:06:00]  Oh, yeah.  It was happening for a while, man.  Yeah, you were a lot closer to, I think, the Eps under.  Yeah, because we were on the border of Virginia and North Carolina, and it was in, what, Marathon  or something, Virginia?  I don't know.  Yeah, one of those fucking shitholes.  Yeah.  No.  How'd you break the laptop?  I was sliding it, and it just fell on the floor and shattered the whole fucking screen.  Do you have a computer for all the time?  No, I do, but, you know, I have to look through, like, a spider web.  Oh, God. 
[00:06:30]  You got the shattered screen?  I got so much stuff to fix.  You got Piggy's glasses from...  Yeah.  I was glad it worked, though, because I thought it broke it, broke it.  Yeah, he's getting your screen.  Yeah, I'm going to have to deal with that today.  Is it a Mac?  Yeah, it's a Mac.  I love my MacBook.  I just don't like the iPhone.  You'll get it.  I think I might find it.  I smashed my monitor once, just blasted it with my fist once, and it did the same thing.  It looked cool as hell.  It was very colorful and crackly. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  And then I had to, like, plug it into something else to try to get enough of a picture where  I could get the information off that computer.  Sure.  Yeah.  That's what I'm going to have to deal with today.  Yeah.  I got a lot of pictures of my BlackBerry.  I'm worried.  But it looks like it's working.  I just can't read the screen, so...  Do you update on your phone?  Do you sync to your computer?  Yeah, but not as often as I should, probably.  So I'm probably a month behind.  Oh.  So I got to do that today.  You kidding me, y'all?  Fuck, dude.  Oh, I know. 
[00:07:30]  You were telling me your vacation sucked because you lost power for five days.  Yeah, I lost power for five fucking days out on Long Island.  It was just...  You know, the hurricane happened, and I was in the pool during the whole hurricane.  It was, like, just swimming around.  It was great.  A lot of fun.  And then the next day, it was very windy, and a tree fell somewhere and knocked a bunch  of lines down, and my power went out, and I was hoping, you know, I didn't know that  at the time, but I was hoping, oh, quick fix, you know.  It's usually not out long here in this neighborhood. 
[00:08:00]  And then one day goes by, two days, I get one generator, get another generator, and I'm  running two generators.  I had to go to Home Depot, make a 220 cord for one of the generators and plug in my pool  pump, and I'm like, I'm wincing as I'm ready to hit the switch, like, eh, oh, this works.  And you hear the generator go, blah, and the pool started going because I had a party for  Sunday, so I couldn't have the pool just sitting there stagnating, turning green. 
[00:08:30]  The leaves in it and shit, and it would have just been a green pool for a party, so.  You could swim in that shit.  Oh, yeah, it's great.  You get one of those fucking brain disease infections that eat your brain as you're trying  to sleep.  Amoebas?  Amoebas up your nose and just eats your brain.  Yeah, so I was just like running the two generators, and my whole vacation was sleep the  entire day away, wake up somewhere around 5 p.m., and then restart the, what amounted 
[00:09:00]  to Maximum Overdrive, the movie, of feeding machines that are screaming out the door.  Oh, fuck that.  Here's what I heard for five days.  Ah!  Ah!  Were your neighbors hearing that?  They, after a while...  Oh, they have to hate you.  No, they, after a while, had their own generators.  Oh, they did?  Yeah, they had to.  And then people, I love people on Twitter, because it's just like, first of all, to find 
[00:09:30]  a generator before this even happened was literally impossible.  Sure.  Uh, so someone tweeted me and said, dude, I found something on Craigslist.  I go, email the guy.  Uh, so I emailed him.  He jacked the price up a little bit, but I was like, yes, I'll take it.  And, uh, I got that one.  And then, uh, one of my buddies brought another one over, and, uh, just was running two generators,  and constantly just going to the gas station with the gas cans.  Wow, what a pain.  My whole house was wired like spaghetti. 
[00:10:00]  I went to, uh, I went to a hardware store and bought every single extension gourd they  had, and it's running down into my basement from outside.  Why do you got pictures of that?  Upstairs, because I had no...  That's a shit I want to see.  I had no joy in it to take any pictures.  I took a few pictures, but, uh, I was just disgusted with the entire, uh, uh, thing.  Our ancestors are stupid.  Oh.  Why would they, why would they put the, the lines above ground? 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, that, that's the whole thing in my neighborhood.  Why couldn't they figure that shit out years ago?  They have the underground ones in a lot of the other neighborhoods.  Mine's an old neighborhood that they built new houses in.  They plowed over the old houses and built new houses.  Yeah.  So, I have new, there's a bunch of new houses with an old antiquated electrical system.  Right.  And, uh, and then I get the people on Twitter, dude, why didn't you get one of those generators  that power the whole house to turn on right after the thing?  It's like, oh yeah, okay, let me work on that right now during the hurricane.  Dang, I'm sure a crew will be right over to bury a 75 kilowatt generator in my yard. 
[00:11:00]  But, uh, you know, being from Long Island, if you do lose power, it's usually for a day.  Yeah.  That's what we're used to growing up.  Unless Gloria happened or one of the big storms.  Which was once in a lifetime for the most part.  So, you, you, you're not thinking generators in general.  You, you're thinking, all right, I can deal with the lights out for one stupid day.  Right.  But four or five, that's a nightmare.  It got crazy.  It got to the point where I was just like, please, please just turn on right now lights. 
[00:11:30]  And then you do your dumb thing where you go into the bathroom and click, you hit the switch.  Oh, it's still off.  Click.  Oh, it's still off.  You just got some dumb habit of turning the lights on every time.  We're creatures of a habit.  Yeah.  We have those little ticks in our brain.  You don't even realize they're there.  Click.  Try to go into your, your bathroom and not turn the switch on.  I know.  When you know all the lights are out in your house.  All the power's out.  Yeah, that's it.  And so I had all those hooked up.  I had internet.  I had television.  So it made it pretty easy.  But then I had a guy from, from Twitter actually made a Twitter account and got in touch with 
[00:12:00]  me and just said, dude, make me a friend and DM me.  I got info.  I'm like, yeah.  That usually never pants out, you idiots.  So I just, I did it.  I don't know how many times I've done that and nothing happens.  Dude, my cousin's uncle's friend.  Yeah.  Like said that you should put half water and half, shut up.  I do it every time though.  I'm like, all right, maybe this time.  So now all I did is I tweeted him back and just put what with a question mark. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  Like in caps.  Sure.  Like what?  I don't have time for this.  I have plenty of time for this, but I have no time for this.  And the guy's like, by the way, I looked up your billing.  I know exactly what happened.  It's a downed tree at this intersection and this intersection.  Was it right around the corner from your house?  It was, uh, yeah, it was a kind of, I saw that coming to your house that I was at Ant's  house the first that the power went out and I had to go around a downed tree and then  all the road.  Yeah. 
[00:13:00]  A massive downed tree.  I bet that was the one.  Yeah.  So the guy goes, he goes, uh, it's like, Hey dude, he goes, uh, tomorrow I'm sending  out a fucking giant crew just to take care of that shit.  Cause Lipa, which is the power company on Long Island, they want the numbers.  They want to be able to go, how many, you know, how many homes did you turn on today?  Uh, 5,000.  And I believe our block that was out was 30 homes.  Oh, so you're like at the end of the line.  We are at the end of the line.  There's people still without power.  Right.  So it was 30 lines.  So, uh, the guy actually sent the crew out and took care of it. 
[00:13:30]  I had power the next day at noon.  It was done.  And, uh, and the 30 other people on my block also got power, which Danny referred to as  Anthony, uh, being, uh, it was Anthony's list.  They were all Jews and they were on Anthony's list.  I saved them.  Uh, but they will never know that it was me and that guy.  So they hate you a little less today.  No, they have no idea.  They have no idea that it was me that got their power turned on. 
[00:14:00]  So make some pamphlets.  Yeah.  Oh, believe me.  If I make pamphlets that I'm sprinkling around my neighborhood, it's not going to be, hey,  I turned on your power.  Make some pamphlets.  They're going to be classics.  But they need to know.  Yeah.  Because I'm sure your neighbors talk about you.  I know.  I'm sure they do.  So at least they can talk nicely about you.  I'm certain they do.  He was the man that got our, uh, our power back on.  Man, damn it.  People still don't have power out there?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Does Danny, did he finally get power back?  I know.  I know Danny was out for the entire week also. 
[00:14:30]  I think this morning he said he got it back like maybe two days ago.  This morning?  Oh, oh, oh.  This morning he said.  Two days ago.  Yeah.  But still two days ago.  Wasn't the hurricane about a week ago already?  Yeah.  I know my brother who lives way out east, he, uh, he only got it back a couple days ago  too.  Yeah.  People started losing their minds.  There was like one guy out on Long Island that just funded a bomb threat to Lipa.  Really?  Another guy that walked in there and was threatening to kill everyone there.  They arrested them, you know.  But it got to the moment.  People are pretty frustrated.  Danny, what time did your, uh, what time did your power come out? 
[00:15:00]  Because you were out for a while, man.  I know.  I was just so lucky I was on vacation the whole time.  Yeah, yeah.  So I had to deal with most of this shit.  But, uh, my, I just got cable back yesterday.  And I just got power.  It was very, very late the day before.  So two days ago.  It was like after 10 o'clock.  So it didn't even make sense for me to even go home and fuck around with stuff.  So my first interaction with my apartment with power was yesterday.  Oh, okay.  Wow.  Damn.  Wow.  Yeah, it sucked.  That's a long ass time in this day and age.  Yeah. 
[00:15:30]  I mean, again, it wasn't.  Obama hates white people.  That's what I'm going to say.  Just like, uh, who was that?  Kanye?  Kanye West.  That said that about George Bush hates black people.  As Michael Myers stood there in shock.  Uh, I will go on the record and say, I believe Obama, uh, hates white people.  Poor Mike Myers.  I was one day away from chainsawing a hole in my roof and waiting for a Black Hawk helicopter  to pick me up.  Nothing better than Mike Myers.  Mike Myers is standing there going, what the fuck?  This is the definition of WTF.  He's just sitting there like, what? 
[00:16:00]  I'm just supposed to be bringing some shit off some cue cards.  Irreversibly.  There's now over 25 feet of water where there is one city streets and thriving neighborhoods.  I hate the way they portray us in the media.  We see a black family.  It says they're looting.  See a white family.  It says they're looking for food.  And you know, it's been five days because most of the people are black.  And even for me to complain about, I would be a hypocrite because I've tried to turn away 
[00:16:30]  from the teacher TV because it's too hard to watch.  I've even been shocking before even giving a donation.  So now I'm calling my business manager right now to see what is the biggest amount I can  give.  And just to imagine if I was down there and those are my people down there.  So anybody out there that wants to do anything that we can help with the setup, the way America  is set up to help the poor, the black people, the less well-off, as slow as possible. 
[00:17:00]  So, I mean, this is, Red Cross is doing everything they can.  We already realize a lot of the people that could help are at war right now fighting another  way.  And they've given them permission to go down and shoot us.  He's so comfortable.  And subtle.  When did he say George Bush hates black people?  In the beginning, right?  Okay.  And he said that the people have been given permission to shoot the black people in...  Right.  Stupid Kanye West. 
[00:17:30]  Shut up.  Just shut the fuck up.  Kanye's a dick.  He just constantly...  How great was it when Obama called him...  What do they call him a jackass?  There's two presidents that hated him.  Right.  How dumb are you when two presidents in a row...  That's not good.  ...polar opposites think you're an asshole.  Exactly.  Yeah, they're not the same president.  They couldn't be more opposite.  And they both hate him.  And they both say, fuck you, Kanye, basically.  So what's up with LIPA?  Why does it take so long?  You know what it is?  Here's the problem.  I know the storm was rough for Long Island, but still, they should be able to get that  shit back in running. 
[00:18:00]  You go down to a lot of areas that have hurricanes, and they're kind of built for it.  Right.  Especially just naturally, the trees.  You know, palm trees can take a motherfucking way.  When you watch a palm tree in a hurricane, the thing is just there going, yeah, go fuck yourself.  Yeah.  I got leaves with slits in them.  Frrrt.  Frrrt.  And they're just kind of one trunk bent over.  And then it's fine.  You get these trees that have been around with rotting limbs, and the root system sucks  because the ground gets wet, and it's got these weird root systems. 
[00:18:30]  They can't take, and the leaves and branches are like a sail.  Right.  So you get a little bit of wind, and those fucking things get knocked right over.  That's why a one will fuck up Long Island.  If it got hit by a two, forget about it.  We'd be out of it.  We'd be back in the Stone Age.  But who thought it was a good idea to just put poles up with wires?  That is crazy.  With trees all around.  Yeah.  Trees.  And all I was hearing was transformers.  Like going, boom!  You just hear that.  Oh, really?  Bam explosion. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, there goes another one.  You remember the ice storm when we were growing up?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You just brought back a memory, because I remember just being a little kid in my bed, hearing that fucking noise all night long.  Yeah.  Not knowing it was another explosion from trees hitting the wires.  Well, this definitely convinced me.  I'm already in the works, getting information on having a giant generator put in that will run my entire house.  And I mean, I want my outdoor lights on.  I want my decorative outdoor lighting to come on in a blackout and everything to run. 
[00:19:30]  This is not going to happen for a bunch of years.  Take a nice storm or something, maybe.  You think?  Yeah, and you know what?  I'd rather just have it.  How long would it last?  Well, it'll run on propane.  So I got a giant propane tank in my ground.  So it'll just run on that motherfucker.  So you have propane in the ground, but what if it runs out?  Like say it's a week without power.  Oh, then the propane company's got to come.  They're just trucks.  Oh, they'll come?  Yeah. 
[00:20:00]  How are they going to come if the trees are down?  They can make it through there.  All right.  I got a giant tank.  It'll run for quite a while before.  Two days?  I really got to worry.  Longer than that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's got a good week in it.  Oh, wow.  With everything running?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Damn.  Yep.  That's it.  What a lousy vacation.  I had to run away from another hurricane.  I know everyone was laughing at me.  I know.  I had to stop looking at Twitter.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Because it brings out the people that hate me. 
[00:20:30]  They're like, two years in a row, dick.  Ah, yeah.  You will get that.  Yes, you will get that.  So, for the people that haven't kept track, last year I went down to the Outer Banks and  I was chased out by Hurricane fucking Earl.  Earl.  Fucking hate Earl.  And I hate Hurricane Earl as well.  But last year was only one day.  Yeah.  And we stayed close because we knew that thing was just going to scrape the Outer Banks.  So, we stayed nice and close.  Yeah.  And we were back in our beach house, nice, after one day in a dumb hotel. 
[00:21:00]  This year, four fucking days.  And we waited until the last possible moment to get the fuck out this year.  Because now I'm an experienced hurricane guy.  Now you're a pro?  Well, what happens is they put out the alert that everyone must leave.  And they said on Thursday, we want everyone out of here starting at nine in the morning.  I'm like, fuck that.  Look at this.  It's a beautiful sunny day.  I'm not leaving today.  As the storm is just barreling down.  But hurricanes, they're what?  40, 50 miles an hour. 
[00:21:30]  Maybe.  At that point, I think it was like 15.  Yeah.  So, I'm like, I had a little more experience.  And this guy, Sam Walker, who's a local radio guy down there, was really helping me out with  real info.  Not like Al Roker and the rest of these assholes on the Weather Channel.  That just want to throw the fear at you first.  And then maybe give you real facts.  Oh, did they love that.  And then Sam Walker finally said, look, you can't stay for this one.  I'm telling you.  He told me to stay last year, but I had no experience.  I'm like, fuck that.  I got to be safe for my family.  So, we got out.  This year, he said, this one you can't stay for. 
[00:22:00]  I'm telling you right now, we know this shit.  And I saw the path.  And it was going right over the Outer Banks.  So, then I look at a map.  I'm like, where the fuck are we going to go?  And I picked, because people have been wondering this for about a week now.  I picked Greenville, North Carolina.  Well, there is a vacation place also.  Garden spot of, no, huh?  How far away was that from where you were?  It turns out, oh, so just to get back to the, so Thursday, everyone left.  We had the best fucking day, Thursday and Friday. 
[00:22:30]  And then we finally left as the rain was coming in, and no one was on the road.  Oh, because they had all, like, bugged out beforehand.  Yeah, because they were the panicky Pete's that, as soon as the government or the local  government says, get the fuck out, they're packing their cars and leaving.  So, now they're in those horrible traffic jams trying to get the fuck out of the way  of the hurricane.  We left a day and a half later, nice, for our ride to Greenville, North Carolina, which  I picked on a map, which was 90 miles to the west.  And guess what? 
[00:23:00]  90 miles you had to go?  Did you get a good hotel?  It was, uh, what the fuck was it?  It was a, uh...  Super 8?  Holy shit, what was it?  A, uh...  Marriott?  A holiday inn?  A holiday inn?  It was like a, uh, uh, fuck, where the fuck?  A Sheridan, maybe?  Comac Motor Inn?  No, it was, it was the nicest hotel in Greenville, North Carolina, but it turns out, we were  still right in the middle of the fucking hurricane, but the, uh, hotel was built for a Cat 4.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  Is there anything, uh, such a thing as a, um, Cat 5? 
[00:23:30]  But, uh, we rented a doozy of a house, and to have to pack up and go, fuck, we're not  coming back.  Yeah.  Because my buddy Sam Walker said, you're not coming back this year, this thing is ugly.  Oh, really?  You thought it was going to be devastation?  So we decided, uh, we decided to go to Greenville, North Carolina, and, uh, we were there for  four fucking days.  Oh.  And no offense to the people in Greenville, North Carolina, but there is nothing to do  in Greenville, North Carolina. 
[00:24:00]  And I mean nothing.  What'd you guys do?  Nothing.  No strip club?  No strip clubs, a lot of strip malls.  Oh, well, a strip mall's different than a strip club, I think.  They do have a Walmart, and they do have a lot of franchise restaurants, and they  whole family went there?  Yeah.  Three hotel rooms.  And we thought it might be a day or two, and the days just started ticking on, and people  are getting more and more depressed.  And then when we're in the hotel, we lose the cable, the lights, and the Wi-Fi.  So you're in a fucking hotel in the middle of this place that isn't known for entertainment. 
[00:24:30]  No.  No, the lights...  And you don't even have TV, or...  No, the lights sort of went back on.  They were flickering off and on for four days.  Jesus.  And I'm out...  Because now I'm thinking, okay, everyone is following this hurricane, so at the very  worst, we're in a safe hotel.  I'll just camp out in my bed and watch the coverage.  I love shit like that.  So we couldn't do that because the cable was out.  I'm like, all right, I'll fucking watch it online.  Wi-Fi goes out.  And know why the Wi-Fi went out? 
[00:25:00]  Because from our hotel window, we could see it.  The fucking Wi-Fi dish, or whatever the fuck it is, my father-in-law pointed this out,  went flying.  You just saw it go flying.  It was gone.  He's like, we're not getting Wi-Fi anytime soon.  And I go, why?  And he pointed to the roof where that shit used to be.  It's like, hey, by the way, yeah, that's our entertainment right there, rolling down  the street.  That's fantastic.  Let's go to Boston next year.  Boston?  Yeah, or San Francisco?  I'm going down there the exact week.  What are the odds? 
[00:25:30]  Three years in a row.  You're just going to...  50-50?  Yeah, that's going to happen, or it's not.  And then I was in touch with this Sam Walker.  I think it's Sam Walker, OBX, on Twitter.  He's a good one to follow if you're on vacation down there, because he'll give you the real  shit.  The skinny.  The skinny.  He's like, they lost a road, but I wasn't in that section.  They literally lost a road where people were now on an island that didn't want to be on  an island.  Yeah.  So I don't even know how they're getting those people back and forth.  I guess a ferry system?  So that part of the road is washed out to the point, they've got to build a whole new 
[00:26:00]  fucking bridge.  And the area I was in, Route 12, we had to take Route 12 north of where it went out, was  holy shit, boulders, rocks, fucking people's backyards, docks, side of houses, all just  covering the road.  So this guy, Sam, goes, you're not going back.  I don't know how they're going to clear this fucking road for you.  But like I told you before the show, tourist dollars are so important down there, oh, 
[00:26:30]  they fucking clear the road.  They wanted all of us back.  Those beaches will remain open.  It's Labor Day weekend.  Right.  Amity means friendship.  And I was listening to local radio, and the locals are all bitchy complaining, why are they  letting the tourists back so early?  We need a couple days to get our shit together.  And I'm thinking, get a politician on the line, because he'll explain to you how much money  they're losing by the day.  They have to get that shit open immediately, because the money is very important, the tourist  dollars.  Top priorita.  At least our mayor didn't panic. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, Jesus Christ.  What a fucking ant.  He was up there just saying, pretty much saying, hey, leave the Zone A.  Manhattan was split up into Zone A, Zone B, Zone C.  Zone A was like the bad, oh my God, look out.  Walkaway Beach.  Yeah.  Wasn't it Manhattan, too?  Yeah, yeah.  The lower tip?  The lower tip?  It's a lower Manhattan.  I'll be a lower, yeah.  And he was pretty much saying, if you don't leave these areas, you will die.  You will die.  He shut the subway down at noon on Friday. 
[00:27:30]  This asshole.  Dude, can I tell you something?  Stay with that point for a second, just to show you something.  Noon on Friday, I was still in the Outer Banks, where the hurricane had to hit first.  Yeah.  And I was enjoying the ocean still.  Yeah, and he's shutting down the fucking subway.  The entire transportation system, buses, everything.  But that's someone that just has no experience with hurricanes.  It takes forever for these storms to move into your area. 
[00:28:00]  Wait, I'm sorry.  Was it Friday or Saturday?  It might have been Saturday.  I'm sorry.  If it was Saturday, that's a little closer.  It might have been Saturday.  I don't know.  When did the storm hit?  Sunday?  Yeah, it was Saturday.  I apologize.  It was Saturday.  The storm hit Sunday, but it was still...  Sunday at what time?  Still.  I don't know, man.  Do you remember it?  What time Sunday?  It was late at night, because I was following Ant's Twitter, and I was watching the UFC fight,  and I was so mad that I didn't go out there.  I think it was like 1 o'clock in the morning, 3 maybe?  On Sunday, early Sunday morning, late Saturday night was pretty much when...  So maybe...  Way too many hours.  Like 17, 18 hours early. 
[00:28:30]  It was.  He should have shut it down like maybe 8 or 9 that night.  They knew it wouldn't be there by then.  Yeah.  He's just a fucking Nancy.  So people could get around, do something.  Jesus.  Panicking.  Yeah, he doesn't know that shit, huh?  He's the worst.  He's the worst.  It wasn't about people.  It was about him looking bad when people died, but they didn't plow right in the winter.  It's all about himself.  And I got killed on Twitter, and I'm going to say it on the air.  I tried to explain it on Twitter, and these fucking idiots just don't read every word in  a tweet.  Really?  I was saying... 
[00:29:00]  This is what I said.  I know the hurricane was really bad for a lot of people in North Carolina, all the way  up the coast.  Jersey, it sucked for a shitload of people.  Long Island sucked for a shitload of people.  But I focused on New York City saying that they were panicking Pete's, and they got everyone  panicking, knowing that the hurricane actually wasn't going to hit Manhattan.  These other people know that.  And so I said, it turned out to be a bust in New York City, and I had NYC in big capital  letters.  People were like, what are you talking about, man?  My fucking house just floated down the street. 
[00:29:30]  I don't have power.  I flooded out.  And so I write these people back.  I'm like, where are you?  I'm in Jersey.  I'm like, I'm talking about Manhattan.  Manhattan proper.  And then I got...  We're talking.  And then one of the guys from Lamb of God got pissed at me.  I thought he was going to fucking kill me, so we're going back and forth on Twitter.  And I'm like, no, dude, I'm talking about New York City and our stupid mayor, like Jimmy  said, Mayor Bloomberg, who panics about everything.  Yeah.  And he goes, well, what do people think about Mayor Bloomberg in New York?  I'm like, ask around, because I guess he's in New York City for a while. 
[00:30:00]  I'm like, ask around.  We think he's a wimp.  Believe me.  We think he's a wimp.  More damage and deaths were done from the fucking parade this weekend.  Yeah, exactly.  They should have closed the subways for that.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Holy shit.  What, were there, 41 shootings?  Fucking escape from New York this weekend.  Jesus.  Yeah, if he wants to keep New Yorkers safe, let's cancel these parades.  Stop the Caribbean Day Parade.  Yeah.  Cancel parades in general.  There's a parade every weekend in this stupid city.  Unbelievable.  But that's what my point, that was all I was saying on Twitter. 
[00:30:30]  Because they sent all the Weather Channel guys to New York City, to the southern tip  of Manhattan.  They were talking about, like, this thing was going to, like you guys said, destroy Manhattan.  Yeah.  And it was a complete bust, because they knew this thing never had a chance to hit Manhattan  as a hurricane.  They knew it.  But they wanted to fucking throw the fear at everybody.  Of course they did.  Sebastian Bach depressed me.  His fucking house.  Yeah, he lost the whole house, right?  Yeah, but some of his stuff got saved, but just as a Kiss fan, and a collector, all of 
[00:31:00]  his old...  Oh, his Kiss memorabilia ones?  Dude, all of it, and his fucking old, like, all these Skid Row stuff he had collected, like,  for a book he could have put on a box set or whatever.  It's like all these irreplaceable tapes and fucking...  Right.  That's the type of stuff you hear about, you're like, ugh.  Yeah, he...  As a Kiss fan, I'm more depressed that he lost his fucking Kiss sleeping bag than I am  that some people got killed.  And then when the storm hit Manhattan, I did finally get some... the cable back and whatnot,  and the coverage was embarrassing. 
[00:31:30]  These people were all over Manhattan trying to find something that went wrong.  Yeah.  And they couldn't find anything.  They could not really find...  The biggest stories were Long Island's flooding.  I mean, in this area.  Jersey.  Right, of course.  Got flooded out pretty good, and then the power outages that just wouldn't end.  But Manhattan itself, what's going to happen?  You're in a building, it's not falling down, it's...  But that was the big story, that a hurricane could hit Manhattan, so all the weather people  decided to go with that, knowing that it was going to be bad for Jersey and Long Island,  but they didn't really fucking focus on that, because it's much more exciting to think that 
[00:32:00]  a hurricane might be hitting Manhattan.  Fuck, I hope we even see the tip of the Chrysler building.  This is going to be a bad one.  It's got...  Shut up.  Yeah, exactly.  Jackasses, all of them.  Yeah, and then when nothing happened, not nothing happened, but when it wasn't in Manhattan,  they were just like, hum-na, hum-na, hum-na, ah, the weather people, the panicky weather  piece.  And then they finally slowly, one by one, had to admit that, oh, I guess they say, we  dodged a bullet, and that drove me nuts on Twitter. 
[00:32:30]  I'm like, we didn't dodge a bullet.  There was no bullet to begin with.  That was my point.  For Manhattan.  For New York City.  Right.  Manhattan.  Yeah.  Queens got nailed, Long Island got nailed, South Shore, Long Island.  North of the city got nailed.  North of the city.  I know all that.  I know all that shit, yeah.  And they should have focused on those places.  I went out in the middle of the hurricane to get stuff from the deli.  This is why I do love New York City, except for the aunt we have as a mayor.  Auntie Mayor.  Yeah, who shuts the subway down way too early.  I just went to the corner store. 
[00:33:00]  Most things were closed because people couldn't get into work because of the subway.  But it's like, there's delis open.  You can always get something here.  Always.  That's why I just love being in Manhattan.  Yeah, it really is.  They're going to fix it as quick as they can in Manhattan.  So, we were in Greenville, North Carolina for four days.  There was a tornado that was heading toward the fucking hotel.  I was telling Aunt, man, you guys that live in these tornado areas, holy shit, that's real fear.  Fuck the hurricane shit where you have days to figure it out. 
[00:33:30]  The cable finally comes on, and my follow-in-law comes running in.  He got us to the presidential suite because we didn't have Wi-Fi.  He's a brilliant man, I'm telling you right now.  I don't know how the fuck he got that down.  I don't have that in my mind.  Like, we lost the Wi-Fi and the cable.  I'm thinking, ah, this sucks.  What are you going to do?  He marched right down to the front desk.  We're here for at least another couple days.  We're having a cable, Wi-Fi.  Next thing you know, they're giving us the presidential three fucking room suite to hang out in. 
[00:34:00]  And I don't know how the fuck he did it, man.  Did you have room service there?  No.  No.  No.  So what did you eat?  Because people from other hotels were coming to our hotel to eat.  It was a nightmare, man.  It was a nightmare.  That just doesn't sound like a fun vacation as far as that part goes.  But the tornado thing, I finally got to experience the fear that shit is all about.  Because we don't get tornadoes around here.  No.  And all of a sudden, he comes running and he's like, turn on the local TV station. 
[00:34:30]  Down there, when it's local shit, they mean business.  They're not trying to get ratings and fear.  They showed the track of this tornado.  And they're just talking about the towns.  It's in Rocky Mountain right now.  It's heading right toward Greenville, North Carolina.  And they blow off everything.  They're like, call your friends.  Call your family.  Make sure your kids are safe.  It's already here.  Dude, it was unbelievable.  And this thing was heading right toward our hotel.  I showed Anna a picture of it. 
[00:35:00]  It turns out to be there's no special ending to the story.  It kind of skated around us.  But the clouds were pitch dark in the middle of the day.  And you could see the formation of the tornado.  So I was dealing with that shit while we were waiting to get back to the Outer Banks.  Yeah, because it just gets pitch black.  Pitch black.  And they were talking about how they were golf ball size.  Hell.  I didn't see any of that.  I'm not going to fucking make this bigger than it was.  But I did saw almost like snowflake type hell for a little while.  Is there a point during this where your wife looks at you and says, why did we come here? 
[00:35:30]  Is there one moment when they say, it looks like there's going to be a hurricane again,  where you just look over and see her in the living room just kind of looking at you from the side?  Like, what the fuck were you thinking?  We were, we started looking, because when you hear about hurricanes, you hear about it three,  four days in advance.  And they're talking about this Irene and we're down in the Outer Banks.  And we started looking at each other like, no way could this possibly happen?  Not again.  Two years in a row.  And slowly but surely, I'm talking to this guy, Sam Walker, every fucking four hours. 
[00:36:00]  And he's like, I'm like, no, come on.  And then the next morning, he's like, and then he finally gave me the red alert.  Dude, this is going to be fucking ugly.  And we're sitting there like, oh, we almost wanted to cry.  Yeah.  I know people have, you know, real shit going on in their lives.  But you're like, what the fuck again?  We're going to have to evacuate?  Will you fly with your baby yet?  Or is he too young?  Yeah, we could fly.  Yeah, you should next year look into a safer place.  It's a beautiful fucking place down there, man.  These fucking beach houses are awesome. 
[00:36:30]  Sure.  The land gets fucking retilled every year.  Of course.  You know what?  Let me tell you something.  So Outer Banks got fucking crushed, right?  And a lot of locals down there are suffering on the Bayside.  And we get back to our beach house.  A few shingles.  That's it.  Oh, really?  My wife actually, because she was curious,  you put pizza boxes in the garage.  They give you a garage to see how high the water would come up.  Pretty smart idea to see what the fuck happens.  Dry pizza boxes.  We could have fucking...  So it wasn't even flooded? 
[00:37:00]  We technically did not have to leave.  I don't know how long they lost power and all that,  but there were a few shingles gone.  That's it.  And all our food.  And all our wine.  And all our beer.  And the rental company could give a fuck,  so they're going to get a beating right now.  Well, someone stole it, right?  They went looting, right?  Dude.  They...  I use Twitty.  And, you know, I'm deeply bummed out how they handle this situation.  What is Twitty?  It's the big rental company down there.  Oh.  And I told them we're going to talk about it on the air. 
[00:37:30]  You know, maybe they don't give a fuck,  because they don't need me, I guess.  Whatever.  But Twitty...  We get back to our house after being gone for four days.  Everything was gone.  Everything.  And if it's a looter,  wouldn't they be taking the really nice flat screen TVs  and the real nice computer they got in there?  And there's other shit in there that's certainly nice enough  if you're desperate enough to be looting houses  that you would take and resell somehow, right?  All our shit was gone.  All our...  We stocked up on beer for two weeks. 
[00:38:00]  We stocked up on really nice wine for two weeks.  I even had my dumb Starbucks.  We had sausage and burgers and steaks all in the freezer just piled up.  Because I'm on the four-by-four beach.  You don't go into town.  You have to bring all your stuff in,  and you just camp out in the house for two weeks.  You go to town a little bit,  but you're pretty much, you know, self-sufficient.  Why don't...  Yeah, why didn't they take the expensive stuff that was there?  I mean, teenagers just looting booze.  Right, and this lady...  Hopefully someone can text me,  because she needs her name on the radio today. 
[00:38:30]  So we get back to the house,  and everything's gone,  and as we're searching around from room to room,  we're adding to the list our toilet paper,  our paper towels,  my kid's detergent,  because you've got to fucking, you know,  wash the baby shit in a different detergent.  They took that.  They took tea.  They took pasta and saw...  They took everything.  Just imagine everything you would buy  for a beach house for two weeks.  So we call them up, like, what the fuck?  And right away, they're like,  oh, looters, looters, looters. 
[00:39:00]  We've heard rumors that houses were being looted.  And then we pushed for, like, three straight days.  Turns out, okay, well, it was only your house.  And then we went and saw the lady with the list.  She goes, well, just tell us, you know,  how much it is, and we'll reimburse you.  I thought that was nice.  It was $1,200.  And that was conservative.  We could have probably went higher,  because we knew some of the stuff  was going to rot or whatever anyway.  So we kept at a conservative number.  She goes, well, we can only give you $500. 
[00:39:30]  And it's the principle of the fucking thing.  I'm like, what are you kidding me?  And then she goes,  well, you guys obviously got robbed,  so you should call the police.  I'm like, why do we have to call the police?  We're renting.  This is your house.  You're responsible for this house, not us.  Yeah, what you were saying before,  so what do they do?  They clean up when everybody leaves, right?  Yeah, what happened?  And then really fast, she goes,  I go, well, how the fuck do they get in the house?  There was no break-in.  She goes, well, we heard that people  were going in and out of houses with credit cards.  What is it, a hood from the 50s? 
[00:40:00]  Right.  We all know the credit card thing from the old days.  You pop that credit card,  you could pop into some houses and some locked doors.  I go, why don't you come up the beach with me right now  with a credit card and get in that fucking house?  It's all deadbolts.  They were insulting our intelligence.  What happens up there...  I'd call a locksmith and give them my credit card number.  Yeah.  Say, I kind of want a credit card.  Waddy, waddy, waddy.  They were insulting our intelligence  and making us look like we're the problem  and we were being a pain in the ass. 
[00:40:30]  I'm like, we've been running with these people  for many, many years,  way before I was involved with my wife's family and stuff.  Oh, yeah, thanks, Ann.  So what happens when people leave,  you rent the beach house for a week,  now the cleaning crews come in and the inspectors,  so whatever's left, they take.  Of course, why not?  You're going back home.  So it's a gold mine.  That's right.  And you always buy too much stuff,  so there might be an extra six-pack of beer laying around.  Maybe there's a bunch of chopped meat in the freezer.  You know the deal. 
[00:41:00]  Maybe a box of cereal unopened.  So you think the cleaning crew thought that you guys had left?  The inspector, or, yeah.  And we had the place for two weeks,  so they either thought it was a one-week rental  and we were gone for good,  or they knew we were a two-week rental,  but because of the hurricane,  they knew we weren't coming back,  but they didn't want to accept Blaine  for whatever reason.  Oh, yeah, that's shitty.  Ugh, that's shitty.  People.  Just left a horrendous taste in our mouth, man.  What the fuck?  And they still wouldn't give you back the full $1,200?  No.  They gave us $500 and then looked at us like, 
[00:41:30]  you know, now get out of here.  We have other things to worry about.  I'm like, well, this is our problem, you know,  so we want this taken care of.  Yeah, she was pretty much a cunt,  this woman, to be honest with you.  You know?  And then my wife, and we never pull this card,  we're sitting there at a desk,  like we're fucking talking to a principal,  and she's trying to basically tell us  we don't know what goes around,  you know, in these parts.  And I'm like, obviously,  you fucking people took our shit,  just admit it and give us our money back,  you know, 
[00:42:00]  and talk to the guy that fucked up.  And then she pulled out the card.  He does a national talk show.  And you should have saw her fucking tune.  Oh, really?  Like, oh, boy.  Now she's going to help us  with the insurance claim,  the police report that we have to do.  I'm like, get the fuck out of here.  It's shit.  So.  Yeah, I would guess cleaning crew,  especially if there's no windows broken.  Of course.  And that's why they didn't steal the TVs.  Well, yeah, what happens is  when a hurricane rolls through,  because it happens all the time down there,  obviously, I know that now,  they send inspectors through, too, 
[00:42:30]  to make sure the house is in,  you know, you could go back in there.  So it was either the inspectors thought,  okay, these people are gone for good, or...  Because your luggage was gone.  Because you didn't leave your luggage.  You took your luggage, right?  Oh, no, we took everything,  because we didn't think we were going back.  Yeah.  But we did come back.  So.  Yeah, that sounds more,  like it makes more sense than, you know,  looters slipping the door with a credit card.  Credit card.  And leaving everything that's of value in there,  and taking baby's fucking lotion.  And then when we had to finally get, 
[00:43:00]  you know, the police out to the house  just for the insurance claim,  and he's like,  he was insulted.  He's like, look, this is my area.  I'm telling you right now,  these houses were not broken into.  Of course not.  We would know,  and that's an insult to us.  And hinted that, you know,  the rental company possibly did it,  made a mistake.  You know, I don't think they did it on purpose.  They just thought we weren't coming back.  But they didn't want to admit that.  Yeah.  Credit cards were the dead bullets.  Get the fuck out of here.  With all the flat screen TVs. 
[00:43:30]  Every room has a beautiful flat screen TV.  Really?  If you're desperate enough to go looting  in houses during a hurricane,  you're going to take the flat screens too  and resell them somewhere, right?  Yeah.  Fuck.  Yeah, I got fucking nailed on my iPhone account.  What happened?  Fucking fraud.  Seriously?  Frauded me.  What do you mean?  I got a text from AT&T,  and it said,  Hey, the username and account billing name 
[00:44:00]  has been changed on your account.  Like, really?  So I log online,  and there's this name,  Jonathan A. Foster.  Now I'm thinking Foster.  Oh, fuck.  That's the X's name.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  I'm like, hmm,  but it's not the brother's name.  So I'm just like,  yeah, what the fuck is this?  And I finally get in touch with AT&T.  First, I change everything.  My password, all the shit. 
[00:44:30]  I try to change my name back to the owner.  You're not allowed online.  Eh.  So I call AT&T,  and I'm like,  what happened?  They go,  someone went into the Apple store in New York City  and decided that they were going to change your name.  I go,  well,  aren't they supposed to get in touch with the guy  that owns the account?  Right.  See if maybe,  you know,  maybe it's cool.  Right.  They go,  well,  yeah,  they're supposed to do that.  And then he opened up five other accounts  under my account.  But I already took auto payment off, 
[00:45:00]  stopped the credit card on there,  and tell you the truth,  what a commercial there.  LifeLock actually got in touch with me  because I have LifeLock.  Yeah.  Got in touch with me and said,  hey,  there's an issue with your AT&T thing.  They were all over that,  and they're also pursuing the investigation.  Jesus.  Do they notify you?  If you hadn't seen that,  would they have notified you?  AT&T and LifeLock both would have,  yeah.  Okay.  And that's how it is.  I didn't say it.  They notified me,  and I went online to my online account  and checked it. 
[00:45:30]  And just five different accounts,  or six,  I'm not even sure,  on my account.  And then they checked my social security number  to make sure nobody had bought anything  and used the social security number  to get in there and make another account.  Right.  But just like fucking somebody.  It sounds like an inside job there  at the Apple store somebody made.  Oh, really?  If you ask me,  who's just going to go,  all right,  we'll change the name? 
[00:46:00]  Hey,  you got ID?  No.  Who's this Anthony guy?  Bah!  Yeah,  yeah.  I don't know,  just change the name,  could you?  Thanks.  Well,  they can find that out,  by the way.  They can go back in through the records  and see which employee did that.  Yeah,  someone that knows some shit.  I'm not liable for any money  that pops up.  They say if your bill gets in  and you see that there's been charges  on there for the phone  because they got six phones,  they went in and bought six phones  and the accounts,  and then I'm like,  oh,  this is great.  You got to put a detective on the payroll. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah,  I know,  right?  I'm telling you.  And then LifeLock actually also  gets in touch  with the credit reporting companies  and tells them,  yeah,  this is what happened.  You know,  don't,  don't fucking,  don't jack the guy.  So LifeLock is good?  Yeah,  I like it.  Well,  it's pretty cheap too.  It's only like 60 bucks a year  or something to have it.  We used to,  I think they used to advertise for us.  Right.  Didn't they?  Yeah,  they did.  Scott and Hop Hog,  I heard about those looters,  Hope,  the perishable goods gang.  Yes.  You got to watch them.  They don't take any TVs, 
[00:47:00]  electronics,  just perishables.  Turkey,  salami.  The lesson here is really simple,  and it happens to all of us.  I hate when people insult my intelligence.  I know what happened.  I'm sitting across a desk.  You know what happened.  Yeah.  So just let's fucking work this out.  Yeah.  Don't tell me about looters  and credit cards  and you're the only house  it happened to  and this and that.  Phoniness.  Fucking pissed me off, man.  Well,  it should.  Checkasses.  And then some asshole, 
[00:47:30]  Twitter's just a place  filled with assholes,  but one guy goes,  No,  no,  no.  One guy goes,  you're a millionaire.  Why would it matter?  Oh,  yeah,  that one was good.  And I'm like,  really?  Really?  So you don't mind being ripped off?  Well,  guess what?  I mind.  Yeah,  you shouldn't mind.  Really?  You go into a house  thinking you got,  it was your shit  and it's gone?  Is that what they sound like? 
[00:48:00]  Me?  Oh,  yeah,  when I read.  I know.  When I read hater tweets,  that's how I read them.  But it's exactly the voice  that comes through  when I read them too.  Just idiots.  You just don't care.  Yeah,  okay,  man.  It doesn't matter  how much fucking money you have,  if you're ripped off,  you're ripped off  and you get really fucking pissed off  and it's very personal,  you stupid fuck.  Exactly.  Like I said,  when I started this story,  it's not about the money.  You know,  I get that.  I'm lucky in that way.  Yes,  I'll admit it,  I'm lucky.  But it's still someone  ripping our shit off. 
[00:48:30]  It pisses you the fuck off.  It's never fun.  I feel violated.  I've been violated.  Well,  welcome back.  Oh my God,  they're saying that  they're looking on,  what happened?  They're looking on eBay  and actually,  you might want to do this,  half-eaten Entenman's cake  once on Greg Opie Hughes  is up for grabs.  So,  that's very funny.  And everyone,  we went around the house  and like,  you know,  it was the one thing  that everyone realized  was missing that  really pissed them off. 
[00:49:00]  To me,  it was my dumb Starbucks coffee  because I knew  we could get more beer and shit.  And then somebody,  it was like their stupid tea  and my wife,  it was like,  are kids detergent,  really?  The fuck?  Was anyone bummed  that like maybe  a real good bottle of wine  was gone or something?  Yeah,  absolutely.  All that shit.  But,  I mean,  looters are going to take  detergent,  really?  Or is that somebody  that is in the know  and says,  wow,  this is all the stuff  left behind,  we're taking all of it?  Yeah,  they won't be back.  Right. 
[00:49:30]  I wonder if there's  some kind of  side business going on.  All the stuff  that is completely unopened,  do they go back  and sell it  to the local grocer  or something  at a drastically  discount price  and then the local grocer  goes,  oh,  fuck,  this wasn't even touched,  let's put it right back  on the shelves.  I just wonder.  Foreigners that take it  and fucking throw it  in their fridge  and feed their family.  It's a fucking gold mine  if you think about it.  Week after week,  people are leaving shit behind.  Yeah.  Yeah,  I wouldn't doubt it.  And like I said,  of course,  take it.  You know,  the people are leaving for good 
[00:50:00]  but don't take the shit  from the people  that are coming back.  Mid-vacation,  you fuck.  Yeah,  you idiots.  So Twitty,  very,  very,  very disappointed in you.  I know I'm just one voice  and it doesn't fucking matter  or whatever  but that's just  not good business.  I hate the name Twitty.  I hate the name Twitty.  Twitty.  And I got it.  Conway Twitty.  I need to know the lady's name.  I hated this fucking woman.  And then when she left our office,  the office we were in  to go get the money, 
[00:50:30]  this is,  all the women there  were in on it  like,  oh God,  these fucking people.  Oh really?  Yeah,  yeah.  She walks out  and they start laughing  in the hallway.  And I know they were laughing  about us.  Oh fucking God.  I know they were laughing  about us.  That Southern hospitality  is bullshit by the way.  I've learned that  over the years.  I mean,  when a Yankee  come down there.  That Southern hospitality,  man,  on the surface,  it's like nice as pie  but you know they're all fucked  and you know what's inside  when they have to be. 
[00:51:00]  I bet you it was  probably some Southern insult  she gave you  that wouldn't make sense up here.  Sure.  She probably walked outside  and,  oh,  what's up?  Oh,  he's over there looking like  his grit hit the pan  with his feet up in the floor.  Looks like a hound dog  with a thorn  by his toe  in his front.  Yeah,  he's maddering  to being the bottom  of a hound dog  with a hunting dog.  Shut up.  Oh,  this is a great line  coming in.  John Gagg  from Bronxville.  Opie,  stolen food.  Anthony,  hack the count.  Did a tranny  steal Jimmy's glasses  this weekend?  Aw. 
[00:51:30]  I most certainly  did not have anything stolen.  I just stayed home  and enjoyed the UFC.  That's all I did.  Yeah,  yeah.  You just chilled out,  Jimmy?  What else could I do?  Chill.  I stayed home.  Oh.  I had a miserable vacation.  People want to know  if the beds were made  after we got back.  They were not made.  I'm thinking  Inspector.  I'm thinking Inspector.  Might have had some people.  Inspector Clouseau.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh,  here,  this,  oh,  you're right.  I forgot about this part. 
[00:52:00]  So,  they're saying looters,  right?  Yeah.  And the looters  were kind enough  after they took  all our shit  to turn the AC up.  Oh,  that's nice.  Because,  you know,  they don't want to waste  energy when no one's  in the house  and having that AC  down in the low 60s,  the mid 60s.  Looting,  you can't work up a sweat.  they were nice enough  to close all the doors,  no broken windows,  and make sure the AC  was at a nice 70.  They fucking raised  the fucking AC.  Yeah,  that's an insider  right there. 
[00:52:30]  I said all this  to this woman,  and God,  I'm so fucking pissed  I don't have her name  because I need to say  her name on the radio  and make me feel  way better.  I said all that.  Really?  They're going to turn  the AC up?  Wouldn't that be you guys  because you don't want  these houses,  you know,  like freezer boxes  when no one's there?  Because that would hurt  your business a little bit?  Yeah,  that actually,  courteous looters,  right?  Yeah,  courteous,  yeah,  with credit cards,  with deadbolts.  All right. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah,  I guess,  we should talk about  the shooting  at the West Indian  Day Parade.  Of course.  Cat Williams.  Yeah.  I'm suspicious  about this one.  No,  no,  I'm not at all.  No.  I love him now.  I never disliked him,  I just never watched him,  but I fucking love  the way he handled this.  Mexicans are getting  mad now at comedy?  No,  maybe it was one guy  heckling him.  I think,  I'm going to guess  Celebrity Theater in Phoenix  because it was in the round  and it was Phoenix.  Yeah.  But I love the way  Cat handled it.  No,  we'll talk about that.  I want to know,  I have to know  about E-Rock's travel. 
[00:53:30]  Oh,  yeah.  I was obsessed with E-Rock  for two weeks.  He has a little red nose  right now.  Oh,  a little red nose.  It looks like some sweetie.  He went on a cruise.  Did somebody close  the fucking,  the door to the buffet  on your face  and go,  it's closed.  Oh,  and there it is.  Welcome back.  Tried to sneak back in,  they saw him.  An hour five,  you're late.  E-Rock's got a red nose.  I heard about  Kenny's vacation,  so we should do  a little more vacation talk.  Yeah,  because I didn't hear  anything about Kenny's. 
[00:54:00]  Anyone else have  vacation talk?  Danny or Sam  or anybody?  Sure.  A little bit.  I saw Sam.  Yeah,  all right.  Really uneventful.  Sam.  It was,  of course it was.  I feel bad  for all the guys  that decided  to go on a cruise ship  as a hurricane  is bound up  the East Coast.  You know,  you can't really get at it.  I can't imagine  that's a good thing.  I mean,  you're not driving  through the middle  of it there,  but you've got to  be in some shit.  There's got to be  a puke fest going on.  You're not getting  the sunlight,  really.  I don't know.  We'll see what he says.  We'll find out 
[00:54:30]  from E-Rock  and Kenny.  And E-Rock,  talking about that beach,  you've got to talk  about that on the air  as well.  That's not a great  book to me.  Oh, yeah, it does.  Can we just lay in there  while people try  to get you back  in the water?  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  I'm sorry.  Oh, oh.  I'm sorry.  I think we're all 
[00:55:00]  going to have to go  on vacation again  because no one had  an ideal vacation  this time around.  Kenny was just  telling us about  his nightmare.  Kenny, you took  a little cruise  you decided, huh?  Yes.  I booked the cruise  last minute  because I had to be  sure I had no work  to do and my son 
[00:55:30]  who's in the military  could take leave.  Sure, sure.  And I looked online.  I saw this nice cruise  that left from  Bayonne, New Jersey  to Bermuda.  Where are all  the best ones  leave from?  Bayonne.  Jim's hometown.  It's funny.  Stop off in the Bronx.  It was very convenient.  Port of Call  in the Bronx.  It's only 20 minutes  or so from my house  so it was very convenient.  Bayonne is the  carnival capital  of the world.  Yeah.  But I guess  a lot of cruises  leave from there. 
[00:56:00]  Brooklyn Terminal  and then Manhattan  also.  But it was Saturday  the 27th  right when the storm  was coming.  5 p.m., right?  Well, we were  supposed to  originally leave  5 p.m.  Then I got a voicemail  the day before  that we're leaving  at 4 p.m.  So get there  an hour early.  Yeah, an hour  is going to make  a difference.  So I have  a good travel agent.  Like I only paid  for a regular room  and she got me  upgraded to Junior Suites  and she got both.  I have room 
[00:56:30]  for me and my wife  and then my two boys.  She got us  two Junior Suites  right next door  to each other  and we were on  the top deck  that was supposed  to be the highest  and your upper deckers.  Yeah.  And then as close  to the middle  as possible  because that's  what's supposed  to be like  less wavy.  Yeah, the top deck  is always good.  If you actually  look at something,  a fulcrum  and a pivot point,  let's say,  and then a stick.  Like a seesaw.  A seesaw. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, yeah,  a seesaw.  And the edges  move further  than what is closer  to the actual pivot point  which is the center  of the ship.  So the further out,  away,  edge to edge  or down to up  you go on a ship,  you will get more motion.  So the top,  probably not the best  place to be  in a hurricane.  Yeah, but he didn't know  he was going to be...  No, I didn't know. 
[00:57:30]  It's just my luck.  On a cruise ship  during a hurricane.  Well, true.  But it is the same floor  where they have all  like the Royal  and the Grand Suites.  Oh, that's good.  So I was in a good neighborhood.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You don't think  I would have enjoyed it?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Because in hindsight,  I could have flown  and been there  in two hours  rather than spending  36 hours at sea.  During a hurricane,  basically.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So how high  were the waves?  So as soon as we get on,  they have the  Bon Voyage party  and like you go 
[00:58:00]  under the Verrazano Bridge  if people are familiar  with New York  and that was like  the coolest thing  and then like  and then once we got out  in the ocean  then we started rocking.  And it was fucking windy.  So they basically  closed the fucking  outside decks.  Yeah.  You know.  Yeah, they don't want people  blowing off  the fucking ship.  so they're like  and then like  they give you like  a cruise planner  like a daily thing  with all the activities  and it's like 
[00:58:30]  meet your cruise people.  Yeah.  I see the fucking  captain's a young guy.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going like  what's his experience?  You need  you want a seasoned  veteran in there.  Seaworthy.  You want the Gordon  Fisherman.  And nobody's  speaking  nobody's American  on them ships.  No, no, no.  Except the singers  and dancers.  The entertainers  are the only  American people  on that boat.  You use the term loosely  on cruise ships  entertainers.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I went to see  a show every night.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Was it really rocking? 
[00:59:00]  Did they have a hard time?  The comedians  are the funniest  because they can't curse.  You know what?  Ship comics  are fantastic.  You get all the  cruise humor.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  Boat jokes.  It's fantastic.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So when you started  getting out into  the water  when did you start  saying to yourself  oh boy  this could be  a problem?  Well, the captain  came on  and made an announcement.  Right?  We don't know  there will be  lots of waves 
[00:59:30]  on the ship.  Yeah, okay.  So he's saying  like instead of  going like diagonally  south by southeast  directly to Bermuda  we went like  due east  and then was going  to make a right  turn and go  like south.  Right turn.  Sure.  And that's supposed  to get right around it.  Right.  And I was going  to add like  a hundred miles  to the trip  but he was going  to go at full speed  to make up  for like  so we still  arrived on time  and he's like  it's going to be  worse between  like midnight 
[01:00:00]  and 2 a.m.  So I was like  so like we eat  dinner  and like  the only thing  to do  stomach full  of food  to vomit  up later  and you eat  like a pig.  Yeah, yeah.  Was there like  buffets and stuff?  I ate myself sick.  I ate dessert  after every meal.  I never eat dessert.  No.  No.  Yeah, you could have  like a breakfast  in the dining room  then go to the buffet  restaurant  have another breakfast  same thing for lunch  and then go to the pool  where they have  a poolside barbecue. 
[01:00:30]  Ooh.  How about the gym?  Was it good?  Yes, the fitness center  was good.  Okay.  You know  and got  Did you overindulge  Kenny?  I was on vacation.  What kind of  dessert did you have?  Because Kenny  never eats dessert.  I've never seen it.  No.  I've known him  for I don't know  off and on  for 10 years now.  I don't think  I've ever seen you  maybe I ate a cookie  in front of me once.  Hey Kenny  want a piece of cake?  No, you go ahead.  You enjoy it.  You enjoy it.  You deserve it.  Yeah.  So on the pool deck 
[01:01:00]  they had soft serve  like low fat yogurt.  Oh boy.  And you can like  make your own  ice cream cone.  It's low fat.  Yeah.  And they had like  strawberry one thing  and like chocolate  and vanilla  so I would make a twist.  You don't realize  how funny this is  because Kenny  knew this.  All the kids  would run away  screaming from the machine  as he walked up.  You're talking about  a guy that  has a dry  baked potato  and a grilled 
[01:01:30]  piece of chicken.  That's it.  That's all he eats.  Oh yeah.  I would order  like two dinners  every time.  You could order  everything.  I was eating  cold soup.  What the fuck  is the point  of cold soup?  Gaspacho.  I don't know.  I don't know.  But I just tasted it  because I could.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cold soup.  So you were  eating a lot.  Yeah.  Did you play  any shuffleboard?  No, but the highlight  of somebody else's cruise  is when I saved 
[01:02:00]  their life.  What?  Whoa.  Yeah.  We went to the hot tub  after one day  of our beach excursions  and going out  in Bermuda.  Bermuda.  Bermuda.  A hot tub  on the ship?  Yeah, yeah.  They have huge hot tubs  that fit like...  Pools, hot tubs.  Could you swim  while it was windy out?  Was there any indoor pools?  Well, the first night  they drained all the pools  and they shut  the fucking decks.  Oh, how shitty.  Yeah.  Because they all  get thrown around in there.  Yeah, so by the next day 
[01:02:30]  like all the people  like families  with kids  must have been  complaining too much  because by like  three o'clock  in the afternoon  they filled up  all the pools  and like opened  the deck  but it was fucking windy.  Is it ocean water  in the pools?  No, but...  Why not?  It is ocean water  but they filter it.  Like the tap water  you drink  is fucking filtered ocean water  getting salt out.  Yeah, they have a whole  desalination plant  on board these boats.  It's amazing.  They're pretty self-sufficient.  Oh, wow.  How does it float?  How does all that shit float?  I don't know.  And there's fucking 
[01:03:00]  over 3,000 people on the boat.  It was a lot of fucking people.  So you went into the nice pool?  Did a little swimming?  Yeah, but let me...  Let's continue on the first night  when it was fucking...  It's his show now.  Kenny's show now.  I love this.  There was 20 foot swell.  Kenny, hi!  20 foot swell.  Yeah, you couldn't walk  without holding on.  Oh, fuck.  That's gotta be a puke fest, man.  I don't know.  I didn't see no boat.  Everybody had like  little patches  of a Dramamine patch 
[01:03:30]  behind their ear.  Oh, yeah.  Behind the ear?  I eat the fucking Dramamine.  You don't put it  behind your ear?  I guess it's  time-release patches.  Oh, why don't they stop?  Right?  That's fucking a placebo.  Like, I bought  like less drowsy Dramamine.  They were giving out  generic Dramamine.  Plus, they were selling  those bracelets you wear.  That don't work.  They're shit, too.  They press your wrist  fucking pulsing thing.  Fuck that.  I don't know.  I didn't take it.  Like, the rest of my family  took it.  I just had like  a dull headache  and felt a little off  more than normal. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, that's the worst.  That's how you make  others feel.  Just by breathing.  A dull headache  and a little off.  Whenever Kenny  walks into the room,  people just kind of  touch the side  of their temple  and they don't know why.  I don't feel very well.  But that fucking night,  I was cursing  because I kept...  I tried to just  sleep through it.  Right.  But I kept waking up.  I was just...  And you looked out there.  All you saw  was fucking white cap waves.  Yeah, crazy.  So I had a nice room 
[01:04:30]  with a balcony.  Could you sit on the balcony  at least?  Yeah, yeah.  If you held on  to the railing.  Were you afraid  of getting thrown  into the water?  No, but let me tell you.  It's real fucking easy  to get rid of somebody.  That's what we always say.  Yeah, we talk about it, man.  If you're murdering somebody,  a loved one or anything,  and you don't use a cruise ship,  you're an asshole.  Yeah, you just gotta  see where the cameras are.  Yeah.  I think they're finally  onto that, though.  Yeah?  I bet you back in the day,  back in the day,  a lot of people  did just that.  I think still,  if you're a little careful,  there's just so much doubt, 
[01:05:00]  and then they can never  find the body.  Yeah.  It's crazy.  Yeah.  And they don't want  to do an investigation  too long because  they've got 3,000 people  they've got to entertain.  Yeah.  And then the second day  was like the whole  full day at sea.  Ah.  Like after dinner,  I was so fucking nauseous  because I just ate too much  and I guess everything.  Oh, man.  I went to bed  and slept for 10 hours,  and then I woke up  in the morning  and we were at Bermuda.  Oh, shit.  So you slept the whole time  on the ship?  The second night, yeah.  Were you getting rocked  to sleep a little bit? 
[01:05:30]  Well, the second night  wasn't bad.  It was getting progressively better.  Oh, okay.  Coming home  was smooth as glass.  Yeah.  I guess that's how  it's supposed to be.  The first night  it was really rough, though.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was unbearable.  I would have an okay  with Dramamine, though.  I don't know, man.  I was thinking of you.  Those,  where it gets really rockin',  and those boats  are made to take some shit  without really rockin'  and stuff,  but wow,  in that kind of stuff,  ooh.  Yeah, it was a good one.  If you even have  an inkling to throwing up  from motion sickness, 
[01:06:00]  you're done.  And the boats  even have like  stabilizer wings  or whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  They probably had  those things out.  They were rockin'.  That wasn't gonna work  in that shit.  Did you see the sea  from where you were?  Ah, see the sea.  I was in it.  No, I know, but I mean...  I was in it.  Yeah, he's in the middle of it.  What do the waves look like?  All the swells.  Fucking white caps.  Jesus.  It was...  That's no fun.  It wasn't.  And then coming home,  it was like nothing.  It was just like water.  Water. 
[01:06:30]  You saved somebody?  Yeah, yeah.  So one day afternoon  we go to the hot tub,  me and my two boys,  and there's different pools.  And we went to like  the adult pool section,  which is one pool.  Why?  And two big hot tubs  on each side, you know.  Yeah.  So like we go to get in  and I see this elderly lady,  not from America,  the kind of lady  that uses chopsticks.  Uh-huh.  To eat.  Sure.  Very vague. 
[01:07:00]  Good one.  Well, I got chastised  on Facebook  because I said  she was Oriental.  Oh, no, it's Asian.  Oriental's a rug.  That's what people told me.  Yes, and they were right.  Dishwetter and stuff.  Who cares?  Yeah.  1920.  So anyway,  it was this old lady  and she's doing a back float.  Chop suey specs.  She didn't eat them.  No, no.  She just had those eyes.  Dude, can we buy those?  Do they still sell them? 
[01:07:30]  I don't know.  So she was floating on her back,  like holding on  to the side of the jacuzzi.  Yeah.  I never saw nobody  do that before.  It's crazy.  So I thought it was  some like ancient Chinese secret.  I don't know.  Because only like her head  was like out of,  her face was above the water.  She was like floating  on her back.  Everything else was.  Holding on to the side.  Oh, that's interesting.  And she was togging up  through like three spots  because she was like, yeah.  That's crazy, yeah.  Yeah, you bitch.  So like I was like  across from her.  So she was like 
[01:08:00]  directly on my eye line.  And like,  so like I couldn't help  but like see her.  But like I must have  taken my eyes off  for like two seconds.  And then all of a sudden  some lady goes,  is she okay?  And I look over  and I look over  and she was underwater  like flailing her arms.  In a jacuzzi?  Yeah.  Who the fuck  drowns in a jacuzzi?  What?  It was so fucking hot  in that jacuzzi.  Oh, that's probably  what happened to her. 
[01:08:30]  We were in for a good  10 minutes.  I don't know how much,  you know,  longer she was in  before that.  The old bag probably  couldn't take the fucking heat.  Yeah, she probably  had a heat stroke  or whatever happened.  How big are these jacuzzis?  Huge.  You could fit like  20, 30 people.  Like as big as this studio?  Yes.  The jacuzzis are this big?  Yes.  And they hang off  the side of the ship now.  They hang off  the side of the ship?  Yeah.  So you can look  through the windows  and look right down  over the ocean.  But they had,  you know,  the adult pool  and then the jacuzzi  on each side.  Ah, that dumb old broad. 
[01:09:00]  So like,  so I pick her up  out of the water  and I heard her  like gurgling  so I turned her  on her side  away from me  so she wouldn't  spit her water on me.  See, you want to make it  seem like you're saving her  but actually you did it  because you don't want  to get her spittle on you.  You know,  my two boys were with me  and, you know,  so then we were going  to like carry her out  and then like some...  So the three of you  bonded and gang fucked her?  Did you squeeze her tits? 
[01:09:30]  No.  No, the thought  didn't occur to me.  Did you give her  some mount to mount?  No, that's out.  You don't have to do that anymore.  We just pound on the chest.  Now, didn't they  didn't they close down  the jacuzzi?  Because they do that  whenever somebody  like fucks up  in a pool or jacuzzi.  They put like  the get the fuck  out of here tape  around there.  There wasn't even  a fucking lifeguard  on that pool deck.  So like,  so when that happened  like these  these like  big  heavy set 
[01:10:00]  Afro-American women  came over.  They must have been  like nursing home  nurses or whatever.  You know,  and then some  big shot fireman  like had to let  everybody know  he was a fireman  started like,  you know,  taking over.  So I'm like,  all right,  here I'm on vacation.  I'm done.  I did my part.  Yeah, yeah.  You know,  and then they like  laid her down  on a lounge chair  and now they're  having an argument  whether they should  raise her head up  or not.  And I'm going,  no,  you raise her feet  so the blood flows 
[01:10:30]  toward her head.  You know,  so then they're like  have to tell the bartender  because the bar was  like right there  like call for help.  Get her a drink.  You know,  it took forever  for a guy to come  with a walkie-talkie.  Yeah.  Then he had to come  with somebody  call for somebody  with a wheelchair  and that had a  blood pressure thing.  And then they had  a call for somebody  with a stretcher.  Oh, jeez.  And then they're like,  why don't they just  throw her overboard  and have the sharks  fucking eat her?  Yeah, exactly.  Who'd miss her?  So then all of a sudden 
[01:11:00]  like, you know,  they give you like  a credit card,  like ID card  that you use everything,  you know.  And it was the only  kind of Asian name  and it had to be her.  I go, this is her.  This is her.  Yeah, something wang.  Yeah, so then like  they take her away  and then she was like  yesterday's news.  And then that night  we were like  going off the boat  and we saw an ambulance  pulled up at the dock.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy.  So she was probably  going to the morgue. 
[01:11:30]  You don't think  she made it?  Look how happy  she is.  That's happiness  to Kenny.  Oh, Kenny loves it.  You know, in Bermuda  they bury people  on top of each other?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  Then they recycle you  like every couple  hundred years.  Yeah.  The graves are  above ground, right?  Yeah.  A lot of those  fucking...  Because they flood  and water tables.  I don't know.  You don't think  she made it, Ken?  Who cares?  What else did  you do on a cruise ship? 
[01:12:00]  This is weird.  Kenny never enjoys himself.  It just took one old lady  dying in a hot tub  to make his vacation.  Make him please  his punch.  Yeah.  No, believe me,  there's a ton of things  that go...  They have  bingo, bingo, bingo,  bingo, bingo, bingo.  I heard that  three times a day.  What's bingo, bingo, bingo?  Play bingo.  No, I get that part,  but why do they  have to say it like that?  I guess that's the song.  Nothing on cruises,  they can't just tell you  like,  and we got bingo going on.  They'll be like,  bingo, bingo,  but there'll be songs  and stuff.  Yeah, they try to make 
[01:12:30]  everything festive.  Yeah.  They have the sexiest  man alive contest  at the pool.  Oh, how'd you fare  on that one?  I didn't go,  but the big shot fireman  got a six,  so I was happy for him.  Out of what?  Ten.  That stinks.  I know.  That's not good.  Good for him.  Good for him.  I'd love to enter that.  My fucking...  Jimmy would be great.  My teats.  Was it a bunch of guys  with abs?  Yeah, they make you  do stupid things.  Oh, God.  And they have everything,  the 70s disco party. 
[01:13:00]  Ah.  So, of course,  I was front and center.  Oh, you did?  Did you?  Yeah.  Yeah?  They had got,  you know,  the cruise ship people  dress up like the village people.  Really?  Wow.  So, they walk around,  like it's the 70s.  Yeah, it's the,  yeah, they do a thing.  And then they have like  the love and marriage game  for couples.  It's like the newlywed game.  Oh, we've all seen that.  Then they play it on the TV.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  In your room,  so you can watch people like  doing a horrible version 
[01:13:30]  of the newlywed game.  Yeah, yeah.  Did you play that again?  No, I watched it on the TV.  I didn't even sit through  that stupid show.  Oh, it's horrible.  Yeah.  I was a comedian.  Yeah.  Max Docelli.  Oh, I like Max.  He's a funny guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's a funny guy.  And some other guy,  I don't remember his name,  Jimmy Carroll.  Yeah, I like you.  He's in Pennsylvania.  And then Bermuda.  How was that?  It was very nice,  but you got to be careful  in Bermuda.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of Bermudarans.  Stay within the compound confines. 
[01:14:00]  No, no, it was cool.  We went.  I got a two-day  like transportation pass  so you have unlimited  like ferry rides  and bus rides.  He's got a ferry ride.  Yeah, you take the ferry.  Yeah, the ferry.  When you jump on his back?  Yeah, we took the ferry  to St. George's,  which is like the oldest town.  Yes, get on.  I'll take you  wherever you need to go.  I'm out of radio.  I'm not doing ferry rides.  Yeah.  Land ho! 
[01:14:30]  Mo!  Then Hamilton  is the capital city.  All right, Hamilton.  We went to Horseshoe Beach  was like the pink sandy beach  on the south side.  How's that pink sand, huh?  Horseshoe Beach.  Yeah, Snorkel Beach.  Was it weird being  from the same animal  and seeing part of the foot?  Dennis?  Is your horse's ass?  Did he snorkel, Kenny?  Yes, yes.  Did he see any bright fishes?  Two snorkels. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  What'd you see?  Just like striped fish.  He just,  there's no passion  to this,  everything is just  gray to Kenny.  Yeah, yeah.  There's no color  that Kenny's like.  Striped fish.  Was there a point  where you and a fish  made eye contact  in the water  and just looked  at each other?  An angelfish said,  Daddy,  I bought an underwater camera.  Oh, how'd that work?  Oh, nice.  Can we see your pictures?  No, my son.  You should have taken  a picture of the  drowning Chinese woman. 
[01:15:30]  I know.  I know.  I know.  And then,  where we landed  in King's Wharf  is like an old fort  that like you can  walk around.  Ah, yeah.  Just like the person  who almost drowned.  Yeah.  Old fort.  It was like  they have old  cannon emplacements  where they used to  protect like the,  yeah, from the pirates  and stuff.  Ah, yes.  Arr.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:16:00]  That's cool.  And they had like  a dolphin thing there  which was a rip,  it was just like  a little pool  you could pet dolphins  for 200 bucks.  Yeah, that's crazy.  That's the ghetto one.  Yeah.  Atlantis has a great one.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They got a really nice  dolphin encounter thing.  A whole cove.  But then these  shitty fucking islands  they go,  yeah, yeah,  swim with the dolphins.  You're in what amounts  to like,  it looks like a tank  and the water's brown  and this poor fucking  dolphin's looking up  at you like,  can't you get me  the fuck out of here?  In Atlantis? 
[01:16:30]  No, Atlantis is great.  That's a good one.  They came up with.  But some of the  other islands  like, you know,  Bermuda I guess  and some of the  other places  I went on a cruise to  the dolphins  just in filthy water  just getting accosted.  Dude,  Opie's Thumb in Cleveland  writes,  Kenny looks like  a Pixar character.  That describes you perfectly.  So you didn't do  the dolphin thing?  No,  200 bucks each?  That's crazy.  I stood there  and I was just as close  to the people 
[01:17:00]  that paid $200.  Right.  Yeah.  You honed in.  That's what I do  at strip clubs.  Yeah.  You sit next to the guy  with all the cash  and then you just  watch the girl  doing shit in front of him.  Speaking of strip clubs,  my boys got a kick out  of when I asked  every islander I saw,  where's the strip clubs?  Ah.  And they go,  no strip clubs, mon.  What?  I bet there were.  Ah,  they're telling me  like I could be a rich man  if I opened one there  so we should move there  and open one.  So why the fuck  don't they have it?  Let's do that.  I don't know. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  And in Bermude,  it's not even one island.  It's like a lot of  little islands  connected together.  I learned.  Well,  the ferries.  The ferries take you  to each island.  But the ferries  take you there,  right?  Yeah,  the ferries.  I got an unlimited pass.  They must be strong swimmers  to get you to all these islands.  Those ferries.  Unlimited pass,  by the way.  Yeah,  unlimited pass  to ride the ferries.  We went to scooters  one afternoon  just to drive around.  Your giant body  on one of those  dumb scooters?  Yeah,  I got a picture.  I'd like to see that.  I put it on my Facebook. 
[01:18:00]  He's riding around  like Emmanuel  in every movie  I ever jerked off to  in the late 70s.  Kenny has a Facebook?  What's your Facebook?  I didn't know this.  Oh,  yeah,  he does.  He does?  How do we know this?  Facebook-ClubSodaKenny.  Dash?  There's no dash.  It's a thing.  It's a fucking slash.  It's a thing.  Nothing better than,  yeah,  I tried to trick people  and I,  like,  switched the picture  because,  you know,  you drive on the left there.  Oh,  that's very,  very,  so,  like,  I inverted the picture  to try to trick people,  but they still figured it out. 
[01:18:30]  Oh,  they did.  Yeah,  that special Eddie  figured it out.  He's like,  why'd you flip the picture?  That's exciting.  In fact,  he was driving an ambulance  and said the word right.  Yeah,  because you've got to,  they drive on the left over there.  Over,  over there.  Yeah.  You go to my page,  not your page.  I'm finding,  there's Kenny right there.  Nice.  Go to my profile,  go down a little bit.  Putting a profile.  He's got a little bit.  Jesus.  Go down a little bit.  Keep going.  Look,  he's getting rambunctious. 
[01:19:00]  Here's my story  about why I saved the lady.  We heard the story.  Yeah,  but you told it on the air  so we don't have to.  That's cute.  While on vacation,  I saved an elderly,  oriental is the word  that he used,  lady's life  when she passed out  in the hot tub  and went under the water.  I picked her up  and turned her on her side  so she wouldn't spit out  the water  that she swallowed  on me.  Then some other people  came over to help her  and I continued my vacation.  You said all that.  I know,  we know it.  But he summed it up  in a paragraph. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah,  concise.  I wish he'd done it.  Yeah.  I wish you'd done that  when he would talk.  Keep going.  Where are some pictures?  Africa Bambada videos.  Where's the pictures?  There,  there,  there.  On your vacation,  you posted an Africa Bambada video?  No,  I didn't have,  I didn't have the internet  while I was there.  Oh,  you can get it right in the room.  That's you?  Holy shit.  Oh my God,  look at his little,  his big legs are sticking out  to your giant on that thing.  He's on a scooter 
[01:20:00]  and his knees are sticking  straight out from the scooter  because the foot pegs  are much too high  for your long-legged physique.  Yeah.  It looks beautiful down there.  It's old.  What are you passing by there,  Kenny?  That's part of  the Royal Dockyard shopping.  Yeah,  a lot of shopping,  right?  When they get back to the dock,  it's like,  they try to run you  through all those shops  and make you buy  dumb beads and stuff.  You know, 
[01:20:30]  that's how,  that's how the cruisers  make money.  They don't want you  to spend it on booze  and in the casino  and then they get a cut  of all the shopping  that they endorse.  Do they take the casino,  the cruise cards  in these places?  What cruise cards?  Oh,  I don't know.  I didn't,  I didn't really,  I used my,  That's some scammy shit  they do.  I did one cruise,  the Greek islands  and we ended up  in Istanbul.  And all of a sudden  they take us to a rug place  making it sound like,  hey,  you want to check out  how they make the rugs  and stuff.  Like,  yeah, 
[01:21:00]  that's kind of cool.  It's part of their culture.  And then a half hour in  you realize,  I'm only here  because they want us  to buy fucking rugs.  They try to sell you.  And then the cruise company,  I guess,  gets a little taste  of the action.  Yeah.  So they drag all these people  to these places  hoping you're going  to buy something.  Has nothing to do  with your vacation.  No.  Yeah.  What cruise line  did you take?  Royal Caribbean,  the same as my friend Eric,  who sent me a nice gift  while I was on my cruise.  Wow.  What did he send you?  Hopefully his resignation. 
[01:21:30]  Red velvet cupcakes  and chocolate-covered strawberries.  Were they a comp gift  that they gave you,  E-Rock?  E-Rock,  did the looters...  You gotta come in.  Can he come in here  and talk?  E-Rock,  did the looters  take my gift  that you sent?  It must have.  Where's my gift?  I guess the looters  took the gift  you sent me  down in the Outer Banks.  I don't know.  Is the hockey thing  hanging back  in your apartment?  Oh!  No,  it is not.  No more gifts  until that thing  makes it back on my wall.  Come in,  Eric.  You're talking about  your vacation.  You're just sitting  in there lollygagging 
[01:22:00]  with your gray cap  and his red nose.  E-Rock.  E-Rock has a little red nose.  He said he's got sunburned  but somehow figured out  a way to get rid  of the sunburn.  I wish that was  a blowtorx that did it.  He probably was bobbing  for fucking fondue.  He could have just said food.  Why is your nose so red?  This is calm  compared to what it was  Friday and Saturday.  Was your whole face red  and now it's only your nose?  From here,  like the bridge of my nose  under my eyes 
[01:22:30]  through my entire forehead  at one point  was just one big  scatty piece of skin.  Take your hat off  and get under a light.  Yeah,  look at that.  Yeah.  Alright,  we see.  Yeah,  it's red.  It's still red.  This is better.  This is really bad  when you fall asleep  at the pool  in the middle of the day  under a hot Caribbean sun.  So now,  where did your cruise  start and end  and what cruise line  did you take?  Did you take  Royal Caribbean as well?  Let me take a picture  of your nose.  Hold on a second.  Look at that fucking schnoz. 
[01:23:00]  It's scabby too.  That's like the time  I smashed my face  in the side of the pool.  Yeah.  Alright,  thanks.  Nice pick.  Jimmy,  you were worried  about E-Rock's  vacation,  weren't you?  Because his wife  and him  were leaving  at separate times.  He was going to  fly down without her  and as the storm approached  I'm like,  I wonder if  E-Rock's wife  met him down there.  Yeah.  I heard rumors  you left her behind  because you wanted  to start your vacation  before her.  That's right.  Yeah,  I was going down 
[01:23:30]  to see some family  a couple days before.  But you guys  didn't fly together  because you were like,  fuck this,  I'm already off,  I'm out of here.  Is that true?  Sure,  I'll go with that.  That's what I heard.  I don't need fake shit.  No,  no,  I was going down  to see a couple  of cousins had kids  recently that I haven't met  so I was going down  a couple days earlier  to meet family.  She had to stay  and work that Friday here  and wasn't going to  get out till late.  So she wanted to  take a little extra time  and was going to  come down Sunday.  What's your Twitter?  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  E-Rock Radio. 
[01:24:00]  Okay.  She was going to  come down Sunday  which turned out  to be the day  that the hurricane  was going to hit.  So that Friday morning  we were talking  about on the air,  we kept trying  to switch her flight  because they're saying  they're going to  shut down the airport  Sunday morning  and Jimmy was very  concerned about all this.  I kept thinking about it.  Did Eric make it down?  I made it down  but the captain  flew through  the damn hurricane  and when you came  out of the hurricane  I'll show you this photo  if I have it on here 
[01:24:30]  I don't know.  Do they fly through  hurricanes then?  You know that shit.  They're not supposed  to with jets.  No,  they go around them.  Usually going from  New York or New Jersey  to Florida  they go out  over the ocean  and then swing back in  but because the storm  was there  they went over  the mainland  but was still  hitting part  of the hurricane  and at one point  it's shaking a little bit  and it's just  completely dark gray  you can't see anything.  The clouds move  and I don't have  the photo  but I'll twitter it later.  We had to have been  maybe a few hundred feet 
[01:25:00]  over the ocean  when the clouds left.  Like you're looking down  and the fucking ocean  is right there.  Like you're getting  ready to land  and then all of a sudden  the plane goes  right back up.  Terrifying.  What happened?  Well,  we got through it  and made it down  to Florida.  Fine.  Well,  I mean,  why did he go down  and then go back up again?  You think he was like,  oh shit.  You'd think he would have  made an announcement.  Didn't say a word.  I don't like making  announcements.  Too busy trying  not to crash.  Yeah,  so I get down there fine 
[01:25:30]  and we switched  my wife's flight twice.  So now she's going  to leave at 11 a.m.  on Saturday  and I'm in Florida  and they're showing  the mayor  on MSNBC  and whatnot  and he's saying,  oh no,  Port Authority's going  to close everything  on Saturday.  So by like 12 o'clock,  1 o'clock,  something around there.  Worthless, yeah.  And then a little later,  oh no,  it's going to close  earlier than that  so we have to switch  her flight again  and at the point,  all the airlines 
[01:26:00]  were just saying,  no,  we're just going  to cancel everything.  There's not going  to be any flights.  So we're making plans  to try to get her  maybe to fly into,  to go to,  take a car to Scranton,  fly to Atlanta  to get to,  like all this stuff.  Just maybe go to Chicago  and just vacation  in Scranton.  Sure.  Yeah,  maybe you can see  where Harry Chapin  wrote the song  about the 30,000 pound  of banana truck  that slid down the hill  into Scranton,  Penn's,  Sylvania.  Or listen to one  of the new  morning guys  in Scranton.  Why? 
[01:26:30]  Wow.  Is that his side joke?  No,  our old,  our old buddy  got a job there.  Who?  Steve.  Steve C?  He's now,  he already has  another radio job?  He's working  the morning show  on Rock 107  in Scranton.  Does he hypnotize people?  And he's still  getting paid by CBS  because they haven't  given him  a severance yet.  So he's still  getting paid  and he's working  at another company.  That's good for him.  Good.  Yeah,  good for Steve.  All right,  so what finally happened?  So about 1 a.m. 
[01:27:00]  Saturday morning,  we finally got something  through with Continental  that she got  the last seat  on a flight  at 6.30  in the morning.  Okay.  So she hasn't slept,  she's throwing everything  into a suitcase,  gets to the airport,  she's waiting,  waiting,  finally gets on the flight.  As they're taking off,  she's watching on TV there,  that now they're closing  the airport  at that time  in the morning.  So she got one  of the last flights out  at 6.30 in the morning.  Well, okay,  that worked then.  Yeah,  so she got down.  I know,  it's like so dramatic. 
[01:27:30]  It was,  it was a big pain in the ass.  Like she was the last  person out of the towers  before they collapsed.  It's a fucking flight.  Let's relax.  She's hanging on  to a pylon  as it leaves Saigon.  Right.  Yeah,  exactly.  All right,  so she's holding  the helicopter.  I mean,  we get it.  Yeah,  so she made it out.  Okay.  And she made it down  to Florida.  Yeah,  she made it down  and we took the cruise  out of Port Canaveral,  which is,  the way they designed it  is just,  you see all the NASA stuff 
[01:28:00]  that's just not being used  left outside.  Really?  You're seeing,  like you can see  the launch pad  from the port,  you can see  the big building  where they assembled  the space shuttle  and tractor it over.  There's just shit  laying all over the,  over the grand.  That big tractor's  not even in the building.  They don't have room for that,  you know.  It's just laying out there.  There's no one around.  You could just walk over  if you want to.  Now especially.  Wow,  that's cool.  I would love to check that out.  I don't give a shit  right now.  Closed up shop.  Yeah.  Yeah,  and I think Disney  bought this port now 
[01:28:30]  or bought everything  on the port  because all the Disney cruises  leave out of there.  So,  we took  a Royal Caribbean ship out  and,  so we get out to see.  Were you in a junior suite  as well?  Yes.  With a nice balcony  and everything.  Cool.  D-Rock knows how to do  the cruise ship thing,  by the way.  This is his thing.  Have you got more  than five cruises?  Oh my God.  How many?  I think this was  my 19th cruise.  Holy shit.  19 cruises.  And,  it was nice to find out  that when I was  checking into the ship 
[01:29:00]  that I am no longer  Diamond status.  What?  Ah,  come on.  What happened?  Are you higher than Diamond?  No,  I'm lower now.  He's cool.  Because,  What happened here?  Because,  I guess,  too many old people  were taking those  three to four day cruises  and their rating system  used to count as  the amount of cruises  you go on  is where you rank  in their system.  Now,  it goes by time.  So,  it doesn't matter  how many cruises you're on,  you have to fill  a certain amount of time  to move to each level.  Oh,  that's crazy. 
[01:29:30]  And,  they added several more levels.  There's like Emerald  and Diamond Plus  and like two other ones.  So,  now I'm at Platinum.  What's above Platinum?  Oh,  that's bullshit.  Platinum,  there's Platinum,  there's Emerald.  Fatinum.  What?  Makes no sense.  No.  But,  I had to try one.  Diamond,  Diamond Plus,  and Pinnacle.  Pinnacle?  Pinnacle.  Pinnacle gets the sweets  in the butler service  like Mr. Kumi,  I guess.  Can you buy into Pinnacle? 
[01:30:00]  You can buy the sweets  but I don't think you can,  you can't buy into the status.  Pinnacle,  wow.  I'm actually planning  something for February.  Well,  don't go on Freedom of the Seas.  Well,  Because that ship sucked.  Why?  It was nice to look at  but,  the staff of the cruise line  didn't really acknowledge  that there were people  on the ship.  Well,  there wasn't much going on.  By 10 o'clock,  the ship was dead.  There was no nightlife.  The casino was barely full.  That sucks. 
[01:30:30]  It was just boring.  Yeah.  So wait,  you're going in February  on a cruise?  Yeah,  we're kind of looking  into it right now.  One week.  One?  That's the one week.  You gotta do two.  Nah,  I've done the two.  Two,  you start going like,  you got me the fuck home.  Enough variety?  Yeah.  Yeah,  one week's fine.  What about a nice 10-dayer?  I've done a couple of those,  too.  They're okay,  but nah,  just a week.  Go down,  go out of Miami.  That way you're close by.  You go,  you visit a couple islands,  then you're back again.  Back home.  Hey,  what else do you do  on your vacation? 
[01:31:00]  Well,  the first stop...  Do you save any Asian women?  No.  No.  Like Kenny?  No.  I saw a bunch of,  used to be celebrities,  but I'll get to that  in a second.  The first stop...  Oh, yeah,  fine.  Pace out the whole hour.  A little tease.  Want to tease that  for the next hour?  What do you want to do here?  It's your show now.  We got time.  The first stop,  they tell us  after the ship left  that we're not going to anymore  because it was  unobtainable  from the damage 
[01:31:30]  from the hurricane.  Roller Corbin  has their own island  called Coco Cay  in the Bahamas.  They bought this island,  they maintain it.  You can't get to it  because it was,  I guess,  it's leveled  or something  because of this hurricane.  So they're saying  we're going to NASA instead  and we're stopping  at Atlantis,  which is nice.  Nice.  Sure.  Like the Atlantis.  But you get off the ship  and what they don't tell you  is that in order  to use the beaches  it's $70.  Yeah,  because they don't want  the riffraff  from the ship  going on to Atlantis.  What?  Yeah.  Well,  you know what, 
[01:32:00]  Atlantis,  the people pay  a lot of money  to go down to the beach  where only the Atlantis people stay.  Right.  So then you get  the ship riffraff.  You know,  they don't want kids  and thousands fucking people  with their coolers  and everything.  But if you're going to pay  that much money  they know that you're probably  going to be  a little more hoity-toity.  Do you think the cruise line  would have taken care  of that for you  since you couldn't go  to the island  that they own  that was damaged  from the hurricane  so we had to go  somewhere else.  You'd think they would have said  here's a voucher  or something,  go to that beach.  It never works in your favor.  Never.  That's what drives me nuts.  This thing nickled and dimed you  everywhere. 
[01:32:30]  What?  Water, soda, coffee, everything.  But you like cruise ships.  I do.  On the ship you had to pay  for everything?  Oh yeah.  I haven't been on  Royal Caribbean in a while  because I was doing  some other cruise lines  but I don't know  if I'm going back there  anytime soon.  I didn't mind Norwegian.  They changed a lot  in the last 10 years.  Norwegian was good.  Norwegian's great.  What's the highest end?  Highest end is a small line  that Royal Caribbean owns.  I forgot the name of it  but it's smaller ships,  very expensive  but you get like 
[01:33:00]  top of the line everything.  They don't nickel and dime you.  No.  I'd rather have one price  than then nickel and diming you.  What finally got you?  How was the weather  the whole time?  The weather was great.  There was one rainstorm  that the boat  was going right into  and then they did  a quick zigzag  and you see it pull  right out of the storm  which was kind of neat.  But it was sunny, nice.  Oh yeah, fantastic.  But the nickel and diming,  what got to you  when you had to pay  for water and shit?  When you're at dinner  and they have  like Kenny said 
[01:33:30]  all these fancy desserts  and what not  and they say  you want a cappuccino  or espresso?  Sure.  So you're having everything  and all of a sudden  they throw a check at you  so now you're paying  for like four or five bucks  for a cappuccino  for an espresso.  Shouldn't that be included?  Yeah, you'd think so.  But the cruise lines  make the bulk of their money  off their bar service.  Sure.  So they're charging you  through the nose  for wine,  for drinks,  for coffee.  You have to buy  a soda package  if you want to drink soda.  And that was like  40 bucks.  Shut up.  Did you buy one?  Yes. 
[01:34:00]  They lost money  on that one.  Yeah.  It was about $40  for 12 bottles of water  because like Kenny was saying  it's still salt water  even though they treat it  and it kind of  fucks you up a little bit.  So if you're just  drinking tap water  or water at dinner  you start getting  really sick  and dehydrated  from drinking water.  Really?  Yeah.  I never noticed that  with the bottled water.  No, not with the bottled water.  Oh, well.  With the regular water.  Oh, I would never  drink that shit.  Yeah, why wouldn't you  just get the bottled water? 
[01:34:30]  I got it the next day.  You figure like  you don't need it.  Yeah, you gotta.  Oh, you gotta.  Yeah, you can't.  It's been a deal.  The a la carte shit  that this world's going into  is just insane.  Paying for everything  individually now.  Well, I'd like to  you know.  Maybe ask.  What?  Maybe ask about something else.  Oh, yeah, of course.  On the cruise.  Well, you obviously  got your nose very red  so the sun's really rough.  How did you get rid of it?  How did I get rid of it?  Kenny was with someone  who almost died?  Yes.  This is nothing 
[01:35:00]  compared to that.  She almost died.  So you're all red.  Yeah, you don't have a story  like Kenny.  You're all red.  Kenny had good stories.  The woman almost died.  Yeah.  And Kenny saved her.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  And you got a red nose  and you're paying  for your own soda.  No, no.  She didn't die.  Now.  All right.  She didn't.  What?  No.  Oh, shit.  She didn't.  No, she didn't.  She didn't die.  No.  No.  So what happened?  Had she died  that would have been  quite the problem  for Kenny  and his vacation 
[01:35:30]  because I don't know  what they do.  Did anybody else  on your vacation die?  Nobody died on my cruise.  Do you swear  no one died?  I swear no one died.  Yeah.  Just you.  Just you.  It is sunburned.  Did you die?  Did you die?  No, I didn't die.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Are you talking  about my fucking hair?  No.  There's rumors  that you might have 
[01:36:00]  dyed your hair.  No, no, no.  Rumors are running rampant  that you might have  dyed your hair  on vacation.  That E-Roc  has...  Eric thought you  pulled him in here  to talk about  a plane fit.  No.  Ah, there it is.  The hat's off.  And a few people  are saying  he absolutely did.  I twittered a photo  of it.  It is not dyed.  I'll tell you  what it is, though.  What?  It is not dyed.  It is...  Would your wife  swear to this?  Yeah, it's not dyed.  There was stuff  sprayed into it,  but it wasn't dyed.  She is...  A little lemon juice  to lighten up your hair? 
[01:36:30]  A little bit.  What'd they put  in your hair?  You dyed your hair.  You dyed your hair.  You dyed your hair.  No, it's not dyed.  You dyed your hair.  Is it peroxide?  No, no.  If I could  peroxide,  I'd be like that.  Okay.  It's called sunnin'.  Sunnin'?  Sunnin'?  Tropical breeze scent.  Sunnin'.  What is sunnin'?  It's what you put  into your hair  to lighten your hair.  So you dyed your hair! 
[01:37:00]  It's obvious.  You put it in,  you go out in the sun,  and then it does  whatever to your hair.  Why did you assume?  Yeah, you put highlights.  Like, why did you think  you needed lighter hair?  Because I wanted lighter hair.  Because everyone's telling him  you should get lighter,  and he just misunderstood.  Sorry.  God damn it.  Oh, you're right.  You eat the best.  You just eat...  It's called sunnin'.  Sunnin' tropical scent.  Sunnin'.  Yes.  It's fantastic.  Oh, boy.  It's awesome.  It'd be great if it actually 
[01:37:30]  worked the way it was supposed to,  but...  Which is what?  It was supposed to be, like,  pretty blonde,  but it came out  like a metallic yellow  or something.  Yeah, it's...  What was wrong with just  the color your hair was?  Yeah, why did you have...  It's dark.  I hate how it's always dark.  Why...  He's a Florida kid.  Eric has been talking  about dying his hair  for a long time.  Born and raised in Florida,  he wants to go back  to his roots.  Yeah, back to the hair.  Probably growing up in Florida,  the sun probably  really made it light.  You don't need sun in  if you're getting  the sun every day.  What part of Florida  did you grow up in again?  I always forget. 
[01:38:00]  Brentwood, Long Island,  and East Islip, Long Island.  No, we don't acknowledge that.  It's West Palm.  Yeah, West Palm he grew up in?  Yes, that is correct.  Yeah.  I mean, when he was  in his late teens,  he moved to Long Island  and stuff, but I mean,  through his whole childhood  and growing up...  He's a Florida kid.  Yeah.  A Floridian.  I mean, why else  would he fly to Florida  to spend some time  with his family?  Right.  Because everybody's  from Florida, including him.  You like the Gators?  Being a Florida kid?  College football sucks.  I agree.  All right.  So, sun in was the 
[01:38:30]  highlight of your vacation?  You put some sun in  in your hair.  And people are saying  sun in has peroxide in it.  Oh, then...  And that's coming from  a girl who does that.  Yeah.  There you go.  Pretty cool.  Amanda goes from Jersey,  swear to God,  I used sun in in 1985  when I was 10.  You should have used  gun in your mouth.  Yeah.  Well, there's a picture  of Iraq Boating  when he was going up  in Florida.  Yeah.  I've gotten in. 
[01:39:00]  Any other vacation highlights?  The bad sun poisoning  that I had on my face.  Yeah.  I saw it starting  to peel a little bit,  so I wanted to get  rid of all of it.  Yeah.  So, you know those  lint brush rolls?  Wait, wait.  You lint brushed your head?  I would peel the tape off  and I'd throw it  over my forehead.  Sun in on the outside  of his head  and nun in on the inside.  And then just  ripped it off  in one motion.  Yeah.  Why?  Why wouldn't you just 
[01:39:30]  let it come off naturally?  Because your whole face  was so tight  you couldn't even  flex or anything.  It was just like  locked.  Why do you want to flex  your face?  Because your face  moves naturally.  Like this.  But I couldn't move.  My face was just frozen.  The skin came off.  Oh yeah, it came off.  Was it bleeding?  Two or three layers.  Why didn't you tweak that?  That's the shit  I want to see, man.  So goddamn painful.  Videotaped that shit.  So, yeah,  ripped it off the forehead,  the nose, 
[01:40:00]  and under the eyes.  Right there.  And it looked like this  how it is right now.  But then you give it  a couple hours  and it's beet red.  Like pulsing.  Blood's starting to come  through the pores  a little bit.  A disaster.  Yeah.  Then you go into the pool  that once was seawater  to try to close the pores.  People are saying,  Iraq,  your skin is always tight.  Yeah.  What was happening  was it was so tight  that every time  he opened his mouth  to eat something,  his back of his feet  would lift up.  Oh, thank you, Jason. 
[01:40:30]  Reminding us  about the celebrities.  Oh, right.  What celebrities?  Oh, yeah.  Well, two of them  I had no idea  who they were  but they're from shows  that my dad used to watch.  The show called Dead Zone  with Anthony Michael Hall.  Michael Hall, right.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It was some guy  who played the sheriff  but my dad's like,  oh, it's...  I had no idea.  I've seen that show.  I know that guy.  A guy from Ray Romano's show  Men of a Certain Age,  he plays the bookie.  He was in the casino  and, again, 
[01:41:00]  I had no idea  who this guy was  but the one  that everybody  was talking about...  Bill Tetley?  There were rumors  but the one  everyone was talking about  and going up...  Jimmy Superfly Snooker?  Yeah.  Natalie Wood?  William Frawley?  I guess.  Pete Wentz?  Just yelling on me.  Pete Wentz, Jesus.  Who was the guy?  Was a... 
[01:41:30]  I guess now  a former radio show host.  Oh, wow.  Steve Carlisi?  Close.  Who seems to be...  Who seems to have trouble  with stairs.  Just falling up  and down the stairs.  Hold on.  Do we know this guy?  You know him.  I know.  Former radio host.  And he's been on the show.  This show?  Yes.  Stairs.  Former radio show host  who has trouble  with stairs.  Does he get looked at  a lot, do you mean?  Yeah.  People knew who he was. 
[01:42:00]  So he had to be on TV then.  He was on TV at one point.  All right.  What if I was on?  He may have had  substance abuse problems.  Well, we don't know that.  Do we?  Yeah, we do.  Was it Inus?  No.  Oh.  He was on our show?  Yeah.  Oh, wait a minute.  Is he a rotund boy?  No.  Everyone was talking about him.  Um, the radio guy.  Cousin Brucie? 
[01:42:30]  Uh, G. Gordon?  No.  Who the fuck have we had on?  Mark Perrano?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Radio guys?  We did a TV show, Ant.  We should be able to get this.  Did a TV show?  J.V. or Elvis?  Do we hate him?  Mark or Brian?  Now you do, yeah.  Now we do.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Eric Logan?  There was a time we didn't hate him?  Um, I think, I think you were sort of friendly with this person at one point, but after their  appearance and, uh, a position that they got, you were no longer friends with them. 
[01:43:00]  Position?  They must have gotten a management job.  Al Dukes.  Were we on the same station as this person?  Not at the same time.  Oh, my gosh.  Jesus Christ.  Wow.  Steve Dahl?  You want me to throw a photo up?  Are you still wanting to guess?  Yeah, I have no problems with Steve Dahl.  No, I know.  I love Steve Dahl.  Kenny knows?  I know.  Yeah, who?  Should I write my guess down?  No, just say it.  Who gives a fuck? 
[01:43:30]  It's not a big mystery.  Danny Bonaduce.  Oh, okay.  That is correct.  He's fine.  No problem.  Danny?  No, I don't have a problem with him, really.  He took over the YSP.  Wait, he was on your cruise ship?  Uh-huh.  He just got fired.  Yeah, he was with, like, 17 people, but sat by himself for dinner.  Like, his table was two tables away from ours, and him and I guess it was his wife sat  there while the rest of his group sat on the other side of the restaurant.  And you asked him for a picture?  Only when I saw him on the island, just to show you that he was on the island.  Oh, okay. 
[01:44:00]  To just say who you are?  I just said, hey, I'm a big fan from Philly.  Miss you on YSP.  Took a photo.  That was it.  Nice.  Danny's fine.  But this guy cannot walk on stairs up or down.  Why?  Because he, he, in the dining room, they have these big stairs that kind of go circular  through the middle and wrap around.  Yeah, it's titanic looking.  Yeah, he's waving to people on the first night, and he's just going like this, and people are  taking photos or whatever.  He's going up the stairs and falls going up the stairs.  Do people laugh at him? 
[01:44:30]  No, people, waiters and everything ran over, and he's just like, no, I'm fine, I'm fine,  I'm fine.  And later, he's in this concierge suite level, that special level that you can't get to.  Oh, yes, yes.  So he comes out of that area and falls down the stairs where nobody saw him except my wife  and I, fell down the stairs there again, and then later on in the cruise, you see him,  anytime there were stairs, he's stumbling.  So I thought maybe he was drinking.  But...  Oh, you could have made that assumption.  Could have made that assumption.  I don't think he was after I saw him a couple more times. 
[01:45:00]  Maybe he was on Dramamine, or maybe the fucking boat rocking knocked him over.  Yeah, there was a hurricane in the water.  You were on a boat.  Yeah.  Were you running back and forth on the ship?  From side to side.  It's just always, I'm sorry, Iraq, I can't stop, all right?  You saw some family members in the water.  I can't stop, I have a problem, I'm an addict.  All that to get him to fess up to dying his hair. 
[01:45:30]  Well, and with that said, Big Red Shark on Twitter writes,  The only thing A-Rock makes lighter is his hair.  Oh.  This doesn't need to do with the weight jokes.  Heavy kid, so what?  Yeah.  He's husky.  He's a husky boy.  Husky boy.  Did you treat yourself on the cruise?  Um, I did where I could, because they don't do midnight buffets anymore.  Oh, wow.  That fucking cruise sucks.  And the room service was so limited and, like, all upscale kind of shit.  Like, who wants a salmon sandwich at, like, two, three in the morning when you're drunk? 
[01:46:00]  You know, it's fresh.  They'd probably take the fucking thing right out of the water there.  What the fuck?  You know, they reach a net in there, boom, grab the fucking thing and cook it up.  It's right perfect.  Guy who knows nothing about anything.  I would imagine if you're on a cruise ship, the midnight buffet's got to be.  It used to be.  That was the shit.  That's where people met.  Well, let's be honest.  Do you think that they might have had one, but they made a mental note to lie to you?  Oh, no.  Everyone else was enjoying the midnight.  That's why Eric changed his hair color, because he was in disguise. 
[01:46:30]  Incognito.  That would drive me nuts, though.  If I'm going to go on a cruise and I want to go on one, I want to eat like a fucking pig.  Pig, how was the gym?  The gym was nice.  Yeah, see, I would go to the gym every day.  Yeah, I did.  I did the gym a couple days, and I did the track that goes around the upper deck of the ship.  Yeah.  Was the gym a 24-hour gym?  Yes.  That's why Danny Bonaduce was falling up and down stairs. 
[01:47:00]  There's another rumor about your cruise.  Did the track include a stick with a fucking cupcake tied to the end?  No, but there was a gourmet cupcake shop on the ship.  Were they free?  No, they were not.  You avoided that, right?  They were locked up in the hold.  Iraq avoided that, though, guys.  I went once.  Slave joke.  Slave joke.  Went once and got enough cupcakes for the week.  Well, four cupcakes are $26.  What?  Four cupcakes are $26.  I want everything just fucking taken.  I don't want to keep paying for shit on a cruise. 
[01:47:30]  No, just give me the number and let's go.  Yeah.  Let's eat and be merry.  They make the cupcakes right there.  They bring the fucking dough on.  They buy it.  Of course.  Where's Troy Kwan?  Because there's another rumor about E-Rock's cruise.  Oh, shit.  Troy Kwan.  And I had a bunch of those kind of drinks, too.  Ah.  Oh, yeah.  So he took a cock with balls on the end of it.  Do they have gay names like my Bikini Tini?  No.  Absolute rents out one of the clubs every night, and they have DJs flown in from around the  world to play. 
[01:48:00]  I don't know who any of these DJs are, but everything that night is all Absolute related.  So it's an Absolute night.  What are they called?  The ones I was drinking were Absolute Cosmos.  Oh, okay.  So that'll figure out the name.  Oh, wow.  Oh, I have a Cosmo.  Delicious.  Troy Kwan in studio.  There's a rumor about Eric and his cruise?  There's a little rumor.  Eric did, from my understanding, and this is just a rumor, that he did very well gambling  as well on the cruise.  Oh.  That is true.  Oh. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, big winner.  I think he's a big gambler.  No, I think a downplay.  What was your game?  What's your poison?  Blackjack.  Ah, see?  That's nice.  And will you give us a number?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, did it pay for your cruise?  It paid for my bill on the cruise.  Oh, that's good.  Oh, so that's only a couple thousand.  Bill a nice guy?  Hello, Bill.  A couple thousand?  Um, yeah, you could say that.  Here's more. 
[01:49:00]  Here's more.  Oh.  This thousand?  Less.  Yeah, all right.  Just a few thousand there.  That's not bad, though.  A little less.  If you could take care of all those drinks.  Oh, look at that.  3,500.  I see some black chips.  They didn't serve BLTs at night.  Yeah, but look.  And two cupcakes.  Gourmet cupcakes and chocolate milk.  Those are the important things to chocolate milk.  Did you tweet that picture?  That one, no.  I saved for the season to tweet that.  Well, there's a, there's also, let's not.  Books I was reading and DVDs I was watching.  What are those candies? 
[01:49:30]  Oh, there's my book.  What are those little candies?  Those are gourmet cupcakes.  No, the little circle candy.  What are they?  No, those are chips.  What's that?  What's that?  I know.  No, he did not do that.  I nearly get it off.  Did you read my book on the cruise?  I'm almost done with it.  Okay, good.  Yeah.  Is this just getting through it the first time?  Yeah.  What a sweet boy.  Right now it's floating in the Atlantic.  I was reading yours and Penn Jillette's book.  Okay.  I starred Penn Jillette's book.  It's pretty good.  Yeah, it's very good.  And that is a Simpsons DVD box set.  Yes.  On top of a wrestling DVD box set. 
[01:50:00]  Right.  That sounds like a good time.  Chocolate milk, some of those $23 cupcakes, and the cash.  Very good.  Good for you, Eddie.  Anything else?  No, the rest of the cruise was pretty fucking boring.  That cruise sounds lame, though, because usually they sound like such fun.  Midnight buffet.  They usually are.  Da, da, da, da, da, da.  They usually are.  Like to the chocolate fountain?  Yeah.  The only other...  Like, I didn't even get on this because the line was too insane, but at the back of the  ship, they have this wave pool here where you slide down towards... 
[01:50:30]  Like, you're going to go fall off the edge of the ship.  Oh, I don't know about that.  Right there behind you.  And you just sit there either surfing or boogie boarding, and the water just shoots you up.  That fucking wave thing stinks.  It's two feet high.  Yeah, it doesn't look like that.  I thought it was going to be like a fucking three or four story drop.  It keeps going.  Yeah.  Like, you don't just slide down it.  The water's shooting at a high rate of speed.  So you could stay there the whole time.  Get it?  You don't get it?  The water's shooting up.  So you're not really moving. 
[01:51:00]  You don't fall in one place.  You're in one spot going...  Is that what happens?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Does it eventually, like, shoot you off the thing?  Like, see, and then there's some...  Oh, that's fucking...  You don't look like you're going to go off the...  There's people watching.  That blows.  That fucking...  What a waste of space.  They should put something else there.  Like a fucking...  Can we do an anchor?  I don't know what.  Like a fucking...  Where they sell parchments.  Old...  Like, copies of old parchments.  Like the Bill of Rights and fucking...  The Magna Carta parchment. 
[01:51:30]  You can go in there and a guy dressed up like a Magna Carta author will sign it.  That's what they should put there.  It's more fun.  We've talked about this for years.  We should do an O&A cruise.  Just so we can see Jimmy on a cruise ship.  I would love to do it.  Why don't we just do it?  We should do it.  Have a rock wall on there.  A miniature golf.  What are we doing in February?  We were going to do a travel and virus cruise once.  I know.  We should maybe look into that again.  Why don't we do it in February?  Some kind of O&A cruise.  What the fuck?  That'd be kind of cool, right?  What else are we doing?  Right?  All right.  You rock out to pay for everything.  That sucks.  So you're not a cruise guy anymore, probably.  I am, but I don't know if I'm going to do... 
[01:52:00]  Someone's taking their business elsewhere.  I might do a smaller ship.  Well.  Wow.  They can't.  They can't at this point.  I won't let him go.  I'm not going to say a word.  Okay.  I'm going to be a good boy.  No, you're not.  That's good enough.  Okay, good.  Yeah.  That's...  You're the...  The smaller ship, the Lusitania.  See, he could help himself.  But it's big.  Took his cruise out of fucking...  The Edmund Fitzgerald. 
[01:52:30]  Go across the lake.  Get your goomy.  Get your goomy.  My ship was three times the size of the Titanic.  Was it really?  Yeah.  Wow.  It's fucking big.  Yeah.  That's a big fucking boat.  That's what Jimmy Carroll,  the cruise director, said.  Jimmy Carroll.  Is he the cruise director?  I don't know.  He's a comedian, right?  I'm out of Philly.  Oh, Jimmy Rhodes is the cruise director.  Right, okay.  I heard his name every five minutes.  What does he do?  He, come on, makes you happy.  Does all the happy stuff.  Is he just a happy guy all the time? 
[01:53:00]  You know he's got to be miserable.  He, he, he's so happy,  his wrists went limp.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  He was one of those happy.  Because he's all waving his arms  like a bunch of happy,  and then his wrists probably got tired,  so they just kind of hang there, right?  I, yeah.  Yeah.  Allegedly.  That's, that's odd,  because you never really see that  with a cruise director,  or any guy, really,  that works on a cruise ship.  Oh, wow.  The guy that's fixed.  He's very masculine,  much like flight attendants.  Oh, this is another thing I didn't fucking like.  I don't know if you know this.  Oh, shit.  Go kids.  Race mixing on the ship.  Yeah. 
[01:53:30]  I like it.  These fucking stateroom people  that clean your room?  Yeah.  They fold fucking towels into animals  and leave them on your bed.  So you don't like that  where you come over  and there's a little fucking dolphin  on your bed?  Well, they waste the fucking towels.  And then the next day  there's like a,  a swan.  You don't like that?  Look, see,  and they use your stuff around your room.  They use your sunglasses.  It looks like a burned victim.  What is that supposed to be?  A swan.  The chimp lady  on her way to Oprah. 
[01:54:00]  A fucking towel  with sunglasses on it.  Then they have the fucking thing  you can go  and they teach you  how to make the stupid towel things.  Are you kidding?  Who cares?  Did you know how to do the snake?  Yeah, that I could do.  I know.  Give a shit.  Look, look, a big bat.  They made a bat  and they hung it up  and put the sunglasses on it.  It's like a pussy I would love.  After the first night  I kept a do not disturb  on my door  in the fucking house.  No more animals?  No more.  I'm out of shape.  Kenny just hates all this.  Why?  It's trying to be a little festive. 
[01:54:30]  You come home,  you're like,  oh,  and you come back to your room,  you're like,  oh, that's nice.  Look at that.  Yeah, but then he got me  because then he would make them  in the morning  instead of the night.  You just want to make  towel animals for you, Kenny.  Look at that.  It's a monkey.  That's kind of cool.  Kenny, would you?  How do they do that?  I don't know how they do that.  I have the booklet.  I'll bring it in tomorrow.  Same.  Because my wife went to the thing.  She went to the thing.  Yeah.  Would you go on a cruise ship  again, Kenny?  She keeps making a snake  and tying the ends together  and telling you to wear it  around your neck. 
[01:55:00]  Pointing at a rafter  and saying,  here,  put the tail  in the snake nest up there.  Would you go on another cruise?  If we all went  like a traveling virus thing,  I would go.  If not,  like I said,  I'd fly to Bermuda  and be there in two hours.  Bermuda.  Where was you?  You can't say that.  Bermuda?  Yeah, Bermuda.  Bermuda.  Whatever.  Whatever. 
[01:55:30]  That is a little speck  out in the ocean, though, huh?  That's not nice.  He was the guy  making the towel animals.  Thank you.  Yeah.  God.  Yeah.  And then,  like,  and then you know  how I call everybody  officer like all  the security guards.  It's really funny.  It'll be some fucking  lame asshole  with no badge or anything.  Excuse me, officer.  Oh, every time  in the parking garage,  we're paying for it. 
[01:56:00]  The person behind  that has the uniform,  officer,  how do we get  to Route 37, officer?  Everyone with the uniform  is officer.  Is the Bermuda?  No one's going to correct that.  No, they never,  they love it.  A doorman?  You have to call  a doorman officer?  No, it's only people  with uniforms  that, like,  want to be seen as cops.  I got you.  The Bermuda custom lady?  Yeah.  Oh, does she,  I made her day  when I called her officer.  Really?  Oh, yeah,  she was so happy.  Thank you, 
[01:56:30]  Mr. Kenny.  Thank you.  Because they look  at your ID.  Yeah, they got to  look at your ID,  make sure you're all  on the up and up,  getting back on the ship.  You can smuggle  whatever you want  and add it in.  They're not checking.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, boy,  that's funny.  Officer.  The funniest  is in the parking garage  and I'm like,  can we just say it  a couple times?  And he'll call  an officer  and ask for directions.  Thank you, officer.  Have a nice day, officer.  Yeah, how can I  get a receipt, officer?  And what's best  is you say officer  at the beginning 
[01:57:00]  of the sentence  and at the end  of the sentence.  Officer,  can I get a receipt, officer?  And they're nothing.  No.  No.  There's just  minimum wage  affirmative action.  Kenny is the best, man.  Iraq's showing us  his pictures  from the cruise  up there.  Oh.  On the Apple TV.  You see those windows?  Those are people's rooms.  Those are the inside  balcony,  inside suites.  That's like the  Grand Promenade  where they have  all the shops.  Do they have a balcony 
[01:57:30]  outside and inside  or no?  No, those are  inside rooms.  Those are just  inside rooms.  How high is that?  What if you want  to see the water?  Right.  How do you see the water?  And you go outside  of your room  and go to the  fucking deck.  Do you have any  pictures from your  deck?  Uh, no.  I don't have those.  They had some  stupid parade  going on every day  in the afternoon.  Oh, down the middle  of the...  They have some  deal with DreamWorks.  Oh, boy.  So, all the  DreamWorks characters  have a parade  at like 4.30,  5 o'clock  and it's just  constant music.  Oh, there you are  in the middle  next to the lady 
[01:58:00]  in the red dress.  Oh, no.  That's a big penguin.  How big is that  ship, honestly?  It held like  almost 5,000 people.  Wow!  That's pretty cool,  though.  I mean,  I would want one  with an outside  balcony view,  but then again,  who am I going  to go with?  You want to see  the ocean  if you're on a cruise  ship, right?  You can't go on a  cruise if you're  single, right?  It's depressing.  They have singles 
[01:58:30]  cruises.  That would be  more depressing  because I would  have to be expected  to meet somebody  by the pool.  That's like  sitting on your  balcony.  Is that your  picture?  No.  Who's that lady?  Is that your  lady?  Oh, that's just  a stock picture  of a room  from the website  of the cruise  company.  I was on the  port side.  A lot of people  don't know that.  Is that a good  place?  I don't know.  It's opposite  of Starbird.  It's a candy,  but that's not  quite as good. 
[01:59:00]  That's what a  star is when  they talk to  Kenny.  Oh, boy.  Sorry, Kenny.  He was on the  Starbird brain  side.  No?  I was hoping to  put something out  of that.  I really got to  pee.  Maybe it's  backing up my  funny bone.  I want to say  I think Kenny  had more fun on  his cruise.  I agree.  They really come  a long way with  life bolts also.  What?  They're motorized  now.  As opposed to  the ones in 
[01:59:30]  your neck?  Not life bolts.  Oh, life bolts?  Life bolts.  Yeah, they come a  long way.  You don't have to  roam no more.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They're actually  pretty good.  They're covered.  They got motors on  them.  Yeah, you got food  for seven days.  Wow!  Holds 150 people  each.  Each?  Yeah, I was  trying to reserve  my own.  How the fuck does  all this float?  Did you see when  they took one out?  They take them out.  When you're docked  at port, they have  like drills. 
[02:00:00]  They have like a  drill with the  things.  You're like all  the fucking  entertainers serve  as the rescue  crew during the  day.  Yeah, yeah.  They're throwing  fake bodies over  the railing and  just at port and  everyone's got to  dive off.  That's the thing  you want to turn  to when you're  about to die.  Max Docelli  fucking hungover.  How big are  these boats?  There's 150  people per boat.  There was 3,100  people on mine.  But how big are  the rescue boats?  Oh, God.  They hold 150  people.  That's crazy.  Yeah, they're big.  Yeah, they're huge.  It is impressive 
[02:00:30]  when they're docked  and you go out  and you do your  shit and you come  back to the ship  and you look up  and go like,  that is a big  fucking boat.  They could have  gave me a bigger  life preserver  though.  Preserver?  Oh, when you  had your muster  call?  We didn't have  to wear it  but I just  walked around  with mine.  Like they told  you, you don't  have to bring  your life jacket  but you brought  yours?  Yeah, you just  walk around  with it.  Was your wife  embarrassed?  Officer, where  do I go for  mustard? 
[02:01:00]  Just a big  goon and a  life preserver  walking around  the ship.  That would be  funny to see you  walking around  the ship in a  life preserver.  I hate that  boom, boom, boom.  Everybody must  participate and I'm  in my room just  like, don't leave me  alone.  And they check the  rooms to make sure  you're just hiding  out.  You gotta sign in  once you're there  with some guy.  Yeah, that later  on is a fucking  croupier.  They scan your  card now.  Yeah, they scan  your card.  Put it right  through the machine.  What's that for?  Everything on the  ship runs through  a card.  You're not allowed  to use cash or 
[02:01:30]  anything.  You get like a  credit card.  That's your room  key.  That's everything.  Yeah, that's to  make sure you  showed up at the  emergency muster  and went to your  muster station to  make sure you  know where to go  if the ship is  sinking.  Yeah, or if you  have a hot dog.  Exactly.  The muster.  I went to the  ketchup station.  Now we're doing  condiment jokes.  You should be  killed.  It certainly is  time for a piss.  Jesus.  I gotta go make  wee-wees.  One time I went  to the buffet and  they were just  closing.  Yeah.  And I took 
[02:02:00]  something without  the tongs.  Boy, did they  give me a dirty  look?  What'd you take  without the tongs?  A hamburger  because they were  like cleaning  everything up real  fast.  So I just  grabbed it.  Hey, hey.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, disease  spreads rampant on  those ships.  They have a lot  of Purell things  everywhere.  Yeah, yeah.  And you feel  compelled to use it.  Yeah, I did.  They tell you to  use it too.  Yeah.  You can just  spread shit around  real fast.  Yeah, if someone  gets like diarrhea  on the ship,  they fucking like  they, uh, 
[02:02:30]  what are they?  Yeah, they  quarantine the  people in their  room.  To get your  money back if  you're quarantined,  I bet you don't.  Oh, really?  So you have  explosive diarrhea  and now you  gotta sit in  another room?  Yeah.  And then they  make everybody  use the Purell  because if  one person  gets it,  all they gotta  do is like  grab a door  and it's  usually fucking  Euro trash  savages or  something that  wipe their ass  with their hand  and then open a  fucking door.  Jesus.  Wash, you  pigs.  The ones that  walk around  naked on the  cruise ship. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, with the  banana hammock  guys?  Oh, God, yeah.  These Euro trash  guys with the  fucking string up  their ass in a  ball bag and  they're just  walking around  the deck.  And they have  their kids  totally naked  going in the  pool and on  the rides and  stuff.  One more E-Rock  story after the  break.  Tell it.  And I did spa  treatments if you  want to know  about that.  Yeah, we do.  We absolutely  do.  We wouldn't.  This is our  vacation show.  So, yeah, more  from E-Rock's  vacation.  Trust me that the  story is about  to tell is really  fucking good. 
[02:03:30]  The spa treatment  I have no idea  about.  Hopefully that's  good, too.  Before the long  break, we had  Uncle Nino and  Vinny from Jersey  Shore on and  Uncle Nino said  what the fuck a lot  and I want to hear  this.  And yeah, Derek  put this together  as we go to break.  Check it out.  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck? 
[02:04:00]  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  Oh, what the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  Oh, what the fuck? 
[02:04:30]  Sirius XM XM.  This is the  O.P. and Anthony  show.  We were talking  going into the  bathroom about Kenny  and how he just  sees things  So differently than people.  We describe it as this.  He doesn't really see colors.  Everything is just one bland color to him.  That's it.  And everything is this or this. 
[02:05:00]  Me and you were saying, who gets mad because they're making your towels into a dumb animal?  It's just a slight festive thing that adds to the whole joy of being on vacation and stuff.  You're not going to be joyful the entire day because that happened.  But you're like, oh, that's kind of cool.  And you move on, whatever.  But Kenny gets annoyed to the point he has to put a do not disturb on his door.  And we're talking about how he's probably choking the towel animals as he sees these things. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, the thing is, it's like the worst that you should feel about that is complete disinterest.  Right, not annoyance.  It shouldn't make you mad.  You could just walk in and be like, ah, whatever.  Sure.  But in general, maybe it puts a smile on your face like, oh, that's cool.  How do they do that?  You're like, wow, that's kind of creative.  Yeah, yeah.  And then you go, all right.  Anyway, you want to order some lunch?  Whatever.  And then you move on.  But with Kenny, it's an annoyance.  He's annoyed that someone tried to make his life a little happier.  Right. 
[02:06:00]  He's probably crushing the little towel heads.  Another thing they do on cruises, they want you to dress up one night.  Yes.  Yes, formal night.  No.  You didn't wear a tux?  No.  I wore a shirt and jeans every night.  What about the captain's dinner or whatever?  Fuck him.  Did you go to it?  No.  Fuck him.  That's another thing.  They have photographers all over the time.  Yes.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They want to take a picture.  Well, that's annoying.  But they ain't free.  No.  That shit's annoying.  Yeah, I agree with you with that.  So the captain's dinner, you get to take a picture with him and you get a free glass of 
[02:06:30]  champagne.  Who the fuck wants a picture with the captain?  Not without Tennille, I don't.  Doing your own setup and joke.  In punchline these days, huh?  Exactly.  Well, a picture with the captain is nice.  I mean, Thurman Munster's not taking money anymore.  But I can get Derek Jeter.  I have a million captain references if you guys got time.  Yes, you do.  Yeah.  Did you tell him you love this cereal?  The head waiter.  I had a tip that I never saw once.  Did you find those strawberries? 
[02:07:00]  Swig.  Hey, did Quig.  Exactly.  Did you sing old Yellowstain?  I got the Yellowstain blues.  Is that what this song was?  Yeah.  It was terrible.  What, you had a tip to waiter and you never saw the guy?  Yeah, I pre-played my gratuities.  I pre-played them.  You pre-paid.  You're having a tough time talking today.  Yeah.  You pre-paid your gratuities?  Yeah.  Here's what I do when I go on a cruise, and this is no shit.  You take the top, like, two or three people that you know are the people that do all the 
[02:07:30]  shit for you, and you grease the shit out of them early.  First day, you go, here.  I want to take care of you.  I just like things nice and everything.  And they will fucking wait on you hand and foot.  Well, I got a good travel agent.  Instead of having, like, the early or the late dinner seating, I got my time dining.  So I went when I wanted to go.  Ah, see?  Right?  So I went to make sure I just had a table for four, so I didn't have to sit with any 
[02:08:00]  farmers during my vacation.  Farmers?  Yeah.  You don't want to sit with the farmers, no.  So I got a nice table for four right by the window, so I had a nice view.  That's good.  Right?  And every night, I gave the maitre d' lady a nice tip.  Yeah.  What's a nice tip?  I gave her $5 every night.  That's not a nice tip.  It's an okay tip.  $5 is nothing.  That's just about an insult.  That stinks. 
[02:08:30]  Why?  Most people don't tip at all.  That's why they...  Including you.  Now, believe me.  That five bucks went a long way.  I didn't have to wait a second for...  I had the same table every night.  Didn't have to wait a second to eat.  The head muckety-muck concierge woman that was on the last cruise.  The second I saw her, I shelled out 10 crisp hundies and slid it to her and said, there's  plenty more where that came from.  Did you give her $1,000 up front?  $1,000 up front. 
[02:09:00]  And let me tell you something.  Anything I needed.  There was a point where I had to get somewhere before I wanted...  But before everybody else, like, to a show.  And I showed up at her office.  They took me and my whole party down one of the elevators they don't use for the people.  It's like a fucking private elevator.  Right up to the fucking thing.  Front row seating for the shows.  Like, you just...  You know, if you got it, then you gotta do that.  I'm in a different tax bracket than you.  I hear you, Kenny.  I hear you.  But I don't think the five bucks is cutting it. 
[02:09:30]  Believe me.  It works.  Did it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, George Washington or whoever's on Lincoln.  Lincoln.  George Washington.  But then, you know, so at the end of the thing, they give you envelopes and I get coupons  for my prepaid gratuities.  And you tried to give me coupon?  Ah!  You put them in the envelope and then I gave a little extra.  Oh, okay.  Right, right.  But not to the head waiter, because I figured it was the maitre d' lady. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  So I go to hand her the envelope.  She goes, I'm not the head waiter.  I go, I thought you were the head waiter.  Yeah, yeah.  She goes, no, that's that guy in the red jacket.  I go, I haven't seen him for a week.  Yeah, who the fuck is he and why am I tipping him?  Yeah, yeah.  So then, and she started cracking up laughing.  I said the same thing to the waiter.  He laughed.  The assistant waiter laughed.  And I said, I haven't seen that guy for a week.  They were laughing.  Because they probably know this guy.  They don't do shit.  So then at the end, he's wearing his red jacket, like, you know, almost with his hand out there. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, yeah, they do that.  It's like, here's your envelope.  I haven't seen you the whole time.  He's like, wait a minute.  I came over and I saw you.  I go, well, you didn't make an impression, so.  You didn't make an impression.  Yeah, you got to hook some of those up.  Some of them you don't even fucking, like, I don't even need to deal with you.  Yeah.  I don't want to deal with you.  And then they do.  They come out with their hands out, pretty much.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  By the way, I want to hear about E-Rock's spa treatment. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  All right, E-Rock.  Come on back in.  Spa treatment.  This guy, Heil Kumia, tweets some funny stuff.  Oh, no.  And he wrote, it's a picture of Ant, but, like, with his hair, like, parted like a Nazi.  It's really creepy.  Yeah, yeah, Heil Kumia.  Heil Kumia.  I've seen that guy.  And he wrote, E-Rock's spa treatment.  He goes, getting the golf ball that was lodged in his blowhole removed.  Which is just inappropriate.  Yeah, another whale joke.  Poor E-Rock.  Some whale jokes for E-Rock.  I didn't make it.  Talk about the other thing first, man.  Oh, yeah.  This sounds like something I'd be interested in. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, we started the morning with a nice E-Rock story,  way before the show started.  One of the stops is an island called St. Martin,  which is split in half between a Dutch side and a French side.  Ah, oui, oui.  What's the other island called?  That's where all the really rich people go.  Kenny, you know?  St. Barts.  Yeah, yeah.  St. Barts, St. Croix.  St. Barts.  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  I want to know, is there any way to go back and grab five seconds ago?  When he said, I'm sorry, but can you grab where he just said Dutch? 
[02:12:00]  Oh, don't forget, forget, it's not a big deal.  It's a Dutch and French.  And it was just one of those choo-choo moments where Anthony was off the mic and he just went,  oui, oui.  There's no reason.  You're right.  I'm an ass.  I'm an utter ass.  That made me laugh.  So you're at St. Martin.  Yeah, so they bring you to the Dutch side, but in order to go to the French side, you've  got a cabin and everything, it takes about an hour.  The beaches on the French side are nude beaches. 
[02:12:30]  So the main beach that they try to push you to is Orient Beach.  And they say, be careful, there's some nudity, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Be careful.  Be careful.  What are you talking about?  Yeah, they've got to warn you.  So you go to the beach.  Get that boner going and walk forward.  You're seeing some nudity, and it's nice, it's topless.  But what they don't really tell you is just off to the side of the beach is a nudist resort  called Club Orient. 
[02:13:00]  And this is where all the Europeans come.  Yeah.  They bring their kids and everything.  And it's just non-stop full frontal.  Naked.  Full frontal, nude.  Yeah.  Teens?  Yeah.  Wow.  Punch that up, Sam.  Let's see if we can get some illegal porn.  I mean, let's see if we can.  That's not illegal.  If they're not posed seductively or sexually.  Of course.  Oh, Travis has it?  Okay.  But that's not child porn.  If they're just for their family.  That's not illegal.  Of course. 
[02:13:30]  One of the stops is an island called St. Martin, which is split in half between a  Dutch side and a French side.  Ah, oui, oui.  What's your life?  As I just take a thing of my soup, a spoonful of my soup.  Oh, what the hell's going on here?  I guarantee you she wasn't on that beach.  But they don't show dividers in the beach.  So you're at the point of the beach that they bring all the cruise people to.  But if you walk down a little bit, you're all of a sudden, you're in the nudist resort. 
[02:14:00]  Keep going.  Let's get as many of these on.  Oh, my God.  Who the fuck was that?  Wiener next?  I guarantee you that chick is nowhere to be seen.  You think they're just the models?  Yes.  People go there?  Ah, look at that, Ryan.  Nice pits.  She's fulking in the beach with her arms up in the air.  Look at that, right?  Just walking around.  Nude.  Damn.  So where are the pics?  So, well, this was the issue.  There were some teenage girls there.  He's fulking the jet from the pool he's in. 
[02:14:30]  Look at the other guy laying out with his cock just...  And he's sitting next to the lady from The Shining with her hairdo.  Continue.  There's teenage girls, but a lot of them you can't really tell if they're of at least 18.  Why?  Because they don't look it.  They're developed, but their face and everything, they don't look like they're 18 years of age. 
[02:15:00]  Wow, that sounds horrid.  So, what I was saying, this might be a great place for you to go and visit.  Oh, yeah.  But I really was not comfortable taking photos.  You weren't comfortable taking photos.  That's not what you told us earlier.  All right, well, the wife was with me as well, and she wasn't too happy.  Wouldn't let you take a few pictures?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She thought it was creepy and disgusting.  Why?  You just took a cock shot for her.  And you were like, yeah.  Yeah, that's creepy and disgusting.  I agree wholeheartedly. 
[02:15:30]  That's when you go, look, I'm going to go get a cappuccino, and then you fucking jump in the bushes with your camera.  Yeah.  Get a few pictures taken.  Take some snapshots.  That's right.  Yeah.  What's wrong with you?  Is that the Dutch side or the French side?  That's the French side.  Oh, well.  I think almost all the beaches on the French side are nudity.  It's wacky French, huh?  The Europeans love going nude.  They do.  Right.  It's a hotel here in New York where when the Europeans come in, well, before 9-11, ruined it.  Yeah. 
[02:16:00]  It was the Park Meridian, right?  We went up there for lunch.  Yeah, and they were sunbathing up on the roof.  They sunbathed on the roof topless because that's what they do back in their countries.  Mm-hmm.  I forgot who turned us on to this, but man, NEW, we got nothing done when we learned that  little fucking tidbit.  Yeah, knowing we'd go up to the roof of the Park Meridian and check out girls sunbathing  topless.  Yeah, they didn't care.  Holy shit, but now you can't get on the roof because of 9-11.  Yeah, they're afraid of, what, snipers?  Stop.  Well, you've got to have a key and all that now.  I used to just be able to go up there as a regular geo. 
[02:16:30]  Fucking bullshit.  Go up there and have lunch and check out titties.  Spa treatments, E-Rock.  Yeah.  What was up with the spa treatments?  There wasn't much to do on the ship, so...  Oh, hold on.  You know what?  This guy was at that beach you were just talking about.  Fair enough.  Jim in Jersey.  Go ahead, Jim.  Yeah.  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  Hello.  So I was going on vacation at St. Ma's.  A buddy of mine told me to buy mirrored glasses for the nude beach.  I buy the mirrored glasses.  I get all excited.  I'm ready to go to the nude beach.  I go to the nude beach. 
[02:17:00]  You and your mirrored glasses.  That's fucking...  That's just a bunch of creeps.  That's just a bunch of creeps with mirrored glasses.  That's like such a hack thing to do.  Oh, God.  But anyway, fair enough.  Go ahead.  All for this way, the wife wouldn't watch you, see you looking at...  But she knows because you got the mirrored glasses.  She's got her mirrored glasses just looking at cock.  Exactly.  So listen, I go on the beach.  I'm looking around.  When I tell you 99% of the people should have put their fucking clothes back on. 
[02:17:30]  That's always the case with nude beaches.  Yeah.  That's true.  Although the one in Turks and Caicos at Club Med, which wasn't a nude beach because the  Europeans went there.  There were some nice ones, if you remember.  Yeah.  No, I do.  Yeah.  We took a few pictures like we were talking about earlier.  We sure did.  In the early days.  We knew how to sneak around in bushes, Iraq, unlike yourself.  I had a digital camera that was like the cameras they're using in the Civil War.  This giant fucking thing.  I had a hold...  It took like three pictures before you were out of space. 
[02:18:00]  I had a hold of a giant fucking light.  Yeah.  It was terrible.  But boy, we got some tid pics.  Yeah, we did.  I ate lunch right next to me on a picnic table.  There's a whole family.  Grandfather, grandmother, the little kids.  Keep going.  Sure.  I mean, I couldn't even eat my lunch.  It was sitting on the park benches.  I mean, they're filthy.  And there's the asses.  Were you eating footlongs? 
[02:18:30]  That might be a problem.  It was insane.  The little kids, I mean, just running around.  Jimmy, you would have loved it, Jim.  What?  Was they running around and frolicking?  Frolicking.  They throw leaves up in the air and yell, yay.  You give them a bunch of balloons and they bounce them and go, whee.  Take them in there.  I love Uncle Paul's whole take on what kids do for fun. 
[02:19:00]  He does do these things from the 50s.  Yeah.  They jump over the garden holes and they go, whoopsie.  Yeah.  And you grab them.  Take them to your room and punish them.  Be on sicko, man.  Love the show, guys.  All right.  Hey.  Thanks, man.  Thank you, sir.  We're moving to the spa treatments.  But the other thing about St. Martin, is that the place where the airplanes fly right over the fucking beach?  And it feels like you can touch them?  I think it is, yeah.  I think that's the famous fucking... 
[02:19:30]  I didn't see that.  Because where they drop you off is Phillipsburg, which is the capital of...  I think that might be the one, though.  You're on a beach and these planes, when they're landing, they're right the fuck over your head.  Because the runway is right there.  People actually stand there and try to...  Hold the fence?  Try to hold the fence.  When they're taking off?  Is that St. Martin?  I think it might be.  Crazy.  Yes.  Well, we'll look it up.  But anyway, spa treatments.  The guy who spelt St. Martin.  You guys want to guess what...  St. Martin.  You guys want to guess what spa treatments C-Rock had? 
[02:20:00]  Mm-hmm.  Well, I'm going to guess massage, because I know Sweetie likes to be comforted.  I'm going to guess probably a facial.  Let me see your hands.  Do you have any barnacles?  Yeah, he had a manicure, maybe.  No.  No, okay.  You got city hands, Mr. Hoover.  Yes.  Manicure.  From holding cake.  Holding cake all your life.  You have any barnacles removed?  Good one.  The hands and feet, I don't like in class.  That wasn't that bad.  I liked where it came from, which was a bile-filled stomach. 
[02:20:30]  Eat me a pork shank.  I'm not angry enough to deliver that line properly.  Give me another week, I'll deliver that properly.  Oh, yeah.  I'm too happy to deliver a hard line like that.  So you went massage?  They're wondering about any ball bag waxing.  Ball bag waxing?  That's not right.  I'm going to go with the, holy shit, look at that plane landing.  That plane, the St. Martin, the very famous video, St. Martin planes landing.  They are literally, it looks like you could touch them.  It's probably 15 to 20 feet above the road, but they probably go like five feet over the 
[02:21:00]  fence when they land.  747s come into there.  Look at this.  Okay, we got one coming in right here.  They go right over the heads of the people on the beach.  You could pause it.  I'm going to say you could maybe jump.  Just before the apron.  Could you jump and hit the wheel?  No.  Off the fence, you could.  If you were on that fence, yes, you could.  Watch.  Holy shit.  Watch off the fence, right there.  That's crazy.  That's probably...  Maybe 20, 25 feet?  I would guess, yeah.  That is fucking insanity. 
[02:21:30]  That's still like too fucking close.  That would scare the shit out of me.  Like when they take off, though, and the people are getting blown back on the beach.  They're holding onto the fence.  Rocks are pummeling their faces.  Oh, yeah.  They love it, though.  Yeah.  It's like a game.  I'm going to go massage, and I'm going to go facial for Mr. E-Rock.  Did the couples massage, and yes, I did the facial.  But there were two other treatments that...  The couple massage is the biggest waste of time, by the way, because you're just staring  at the floor.  You don't even know anyone else is in the fucking room.  No, and at the end, they ring some stupid little bell that you know that it's done, 
[02:22:00]  and they put your hands together, and they go, okay, we're done.  We'll see you in a few minutes, and they leave the room.  Right, but I would do it.  Well, what happened to Jimmy's mic?  That's better this way.  No.  No, you say.  I would get a couples massage with my ex, and fucking Chip would pipe up, and I knew  that she was getting...  Oh, you rubbed my shoulder so hard, I'm not going to be able to carry rocks or nothing.  Stuff like that.  Something like that.  And I knew my ex was like, ugh, she's so fucking annoying. 
[02:22:30]  Embarrassed.  Oh, humiliated.  Embarrassed.  Because they knew we were a couple.  Like, why is she with him?  Why is she with this unfunny asshole, there'll be no laughter in the room?  So what else did you get?  Facial.  Yes.  The best did the facial.  Facial's a fucking rule, man.  But the type they gave in Caligula, where there'd be five guys just jacking onto his  face.  Why not to explain it?  This one was a little different.  It was 55 minutes, and they put this gel on your face, and then...  Ah, but they do.  Gel on?  There it is again. 
[02:23:00]  Of course.  Sure they do.  Yes.  And you have to eat your way out of it.  It's like a...  You just have to keep reapplying it.  Where's it all going?  Sorry.  And so they put this gel on your face, but then they take out these two wands that  it looks like it's hooked to a car battery, and what this is supposed to do is the gel  in your face, it's supposed to...  Heat it up?  It works like an electric magnet, where it's supposed to push the gel into the bottom layer 
[02:23:30]  of your skin, not just the top.  What a scam this is.  Yeah, so I'm sitting there with this stuff on my face, and then all of a sudden they're  like, hold this, and I look down at my hand.  And it's a black wand.  Yeah, I bet it is.  So I'm looking at it.  With two magic crystal balls.  I don't even know where the gel came from.  Fucking...  Did you...  Did you wonder why there was an ashy hand on the back of your head?  Open your mouth, boy.  Keep your eyes closed like the guy from the Serpent and the Rainbows. 
[02:24:00]  Here come more gel.  Yeah, don't look over that way.  Your wife's getting treatment, too.  All right, so you're holding the black wand.  Yeah, so I look at it and go, so what is this?  And she goes, oh, hold on to that.  That's grounding.  You have to hold on to your own grounding?  Yeah, you have this black wand in your hand.  Get the fuck out of here.  But they ask you, it's like, you don't have any metal plates in you or hip joint things.  They were just wondering from your weight. 
[02:24:30]  It was an I-beam.  Jim did a spit take.  Well, it happens.  It happens sometimes.  It's not possible that he weighs 300 pounds.  It must have sucked on you.  I can't apologize enough, Euron.  Keep going.  It's nine.  One more hour.  That is fine.  It's nine.  I-beam.  One more hour?  Who are you talking to?  All right, 30 minutes.  30 minutes tops.  First day back.  Let's take it slow. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, please.  Come on.  Yeah, we've got to lull ourselves into this.  That's right, we do.  Go ahead, Euron.  Actually, after vacation storage, we have nothing left.  So they take the two red wands and they're moving it around your face.  And you're feeling a little bit of a buzz.  Like a tingly?  Yeah.  Which shouldn't be happening in a facial.  But they go through everything.  Cleaning, digging into your pores, whatever.  And then they do it again to seal it off.  So it closes your pores.  They do it once to put the gel into the lower levels of your skin. 
[02:25:30]  And then they do it again just to seal all your pores.  A sealant, right?  Yeah.  And then it's supposed to have this moisturizer just compacted way down into your skin.  And then they try to sell you shit at the end of it.  Of course they do.  Well, this will work for the puffiness under your eyes.  I had a facial until I realized my nose sucks.  And this fucking woman was squeezing blackheads out for half my facial.  Did you get your blackheads squeezed out?  It really wasn't that bad.  I guess your nose, if you put it under a fucking magnifying glass, it just sucks. 
[02:26:00]  It looks like the end of an ice pick going right into your nose.  Yeah.  And it hurts like a motherfucker.  It's like they're just stabbing each individual pore.  This is supposed to be nice.  You're squeezing shit out of my nose.  I like those, though, because you feel like they're getting something done.  Yeah?  Yeah, like when I've gotten a few facials, and I want them to spend as much time pulling  pimples out as they can.  You know what?  I'm silly on cruises. 
[02:26:30]  I like having like a banana rum drink, laying out in the sun, and just, yeah, and then I'll  go and play some blackjack.  I don't know.  People fucking putting electrodes on my face.  It sounds like Rambo.  You don't like getting a massage every once in a while, though?  No.  Oh, fuck.  It's the best.  I don't give a shit.  As long as there's something there for me to like scratch my back on.  All right.  I'm good.  Well, the electricity returns later for another service that I had done. 
[02:27:00]  The hell they do.  Jesus, you spent a lot of money.  Oh, no.  You made money, though.  So that was the first two treatments that we had.  Then the third one, I decided to...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Let's guess it.  So you had a massage and a facial.  And a facial.  Third one.  Third one.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Don't...  And I will say this is multi-session.  Multi-session.  What the fuck?  Oh, God.  Liposuction.  Oh, shit. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, shit.  Wait for step four.  Really?  Wait, multi?  You had to go back more than...  Three days.  What?  Three fucking days you had to waste going to this thing.  Wait, wait.  What's left, though?  I don't get this.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Ankle reinforcements?  Hip, legs, ankle.  I'm just teasing.  Oh, there's more to go.  So it's another electronic thing, though.  No, no.  The third one isn't. 
[02:28:00]  The fourth.  It comes back.  Oh, I think I know.  Did they do the hot stones on you?  No, no, no.  Did you have...  Oh, silly me.  They have some kind of lava rock treatment.  Yeah, yeah.  Did they do the bath thing, the shower, the waterfall-y shower thing?  No, they don't have that on there.  They don't have that on there.  Dude, I had a rock massage once until all the rocks started falling off my back, just disrupting  my massage.  It's ridiculous.  You know how to use it properly?  I hate hot rocks.  Hot rocks on your back sucks.  Rock massage I like are the ones that Islam's used. 
[02:28:30]  The Islam excuse.  To an adulterer.  Yes.  I move slightly in the facial rock massage.  Oh, did you just order that because you thought Dwayne Johnson was going to come in and rub you?  I'm going to go with electrolysis.  Anyone else want to guess?  Ah, fuck.  Maybe...  Maybe he isn't a hairy gentleman.  That's like to stop hair growth.  Uh-uh.  Yeah.  But he has hair on his little butt cheeks and it crosses over. 
[02:29:00]  And it's always, it's always getting ripped by fists.  Jesus.  There's no need.  I did a barnacle joke and it felt miserable, Jason.  Why would you try?  Um.  Um.  I don't know.  Let's see.  Wow, I don't fucking know.  I just get massages in the occasional facial.  I don't even know what else you could get.  Yeah, what do you do?  You got that at the massage?  Uh-oh.  Yeah, the electric fucking thing.  They got acupuncture on the boat.  Oh, shit. 
[02:29:30]  Give him a bell.  You got some acupuncture, huh?  I tried acupuncture.  That's good.  I've done the acupuncture.  I just had a nice nap.  Wow, wow, wow.  Needles popping, balloons.  Did you?  Yes, of course.  Yes.  Did you hear...  Holy shit, you just lost 30 pounds around the room.  Who applied to Richard Harris?  If anybody remembers.  I've done acupuncture.  It's bullshit.  No, I don't know, man.  I have mixed feelings about it.  I get a nice little nap out of it. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, needles don't hurt.  You don't even know they're in there.  But you feel certain parts of your mum.  Did you get the vibrating needles?  No, no.  This is where they were just following muscle and blood points on you.  That must have been hard to find.  So they...  They were just guessing after a while.  This is usually muscle here.  Is this your eye or elbow? 
[02:30:30]  No, no.  I've never had acupuncture before.  I had you.  I think it's bullshit.  Yeah.  I felt relaxed.  I don't know what the fuck it is.  The third treatment was a problem, but the first two...  Oh, no.  What was the problem?  You start laying down, like you would for a massage, and they ask you all these questions,  like, do you have certain diseases?  Do you have joint pains and all this other shit?  A scale?  Do you ever have self-control? 
[02:31:00]  What else do they ask you?  Joint pain.  Because they want to know where to treat.  Right.  So, um...  Yeah.  Some of...  Like, they ask you, you know, forms of cancer.  Like, I don't know how acupuncture is going to do anything for cancer.  Yeah.  Well, it isn't.  So, they just do whatever basic...  Go ahead.  Do you have any cancer?  And you should say, well, I am one.  I don't mean that. 
[02:31:30]  Of course not.  So, where were they putting it?  They were putting...  Like, they'll follow your spine down, and then they do sort of like a loop from your vertebrae  to follow, I guess, a muscle pattern or something.  Yeah, in your case, I guess.  Yes.  Yeah.  Okay.  And then...  They sit there, and they go, okay, and then, like, two quick taps, and the needle goes right  into you.  What?  Now, certain parts, you don't feel it, but then when they start putting it into, like, 
[02:32:00]  your ankles, like, right above your ankles...  Did you get any finger webbing?  No, but they did it, like, right above the joints of your toes.  Yeah, that sounds fucking stupid.  Wait, you sure it was acupuncture and not that you were getting harpooned?  No.  Keep going.  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  All right, that was good.  That's not bad, E-Rock.  You've got to give me that one.  So, yeah, so, you know, they're putting it into parts of your calf, your ankle, your 
[02:32:30]  back, your neck, and that's fine.  But then you flip over, they're putting it, like, in between your eyes.  What the fuck is that about?  That one doesn't hurt at all.  I've had that one.  Yeah, on the chin.  In between your eyes, side of your neck.  Had that one.  Right in your, what Jim calls the pubis area, right in there.  Get the fuck out of here.  Why would they do that?  I have no idea.  No, because you answered a question that you have problems with coming.  Yeah.  Cheers.  I wasn't even aware of that. 
[02:33:00]  It's probably what you said.  Yep.  So, there was there.  Some sexual problems outside of, juice up that area for you.  And then they do, they follow the, like, the main veins going in your leg and your calf  going down to your foot.  So, she did one into my calf, this is on the third session, and it felt like, it felt like  you were electrocuted.  Fuck yeah.  Holy shit.  Because you, you jolt like that because of the pain, and now all the blood's rushing 
[02:33:30]  to right where that needle is.  Like, you feel it throbbing and pulsing right in that section.  Fuck this.  So, she puts, they're in my leg, and then she puts one right in here, in the middle  part of my left hand.  Back of your hand, yeah.  Back of my hand.  And it hurt like hell.  But then they leave the room for, like, five, ten minutes to let it sit in and do whatever.  I keep plucking these things out going, go fuck yourself.  Do you have your iPad or something?  No, you just lay there listening to, like, hypnotic music.  You're paying for torture.  Like, what is this supposed to help? 
[02:34:00]  Exactly.  Is that the shit on your chest?  Well, here's...  What do you get out of it in the end?  You're fucking suffering.  I hate to.  Use needles.  Yeah, some dirty Caribbean island you're getting acupuncture.  What's wrong with you?  Yeah, I felt no different.  But this part, you know, get ready for some kind of heart jokes or whatever.  No.  But on the one in the back of my left hand, after a few minutes, I go to bend, and it's  so unbearable that I can't even bend my whole hand. 
[02:34:30]  And now I start feeling my whole left side of my hand up my arm is going numb.  Oh, my God.  You're having a heart attack.  That's exactly what I thought.  How do you get acupuncture and our prayers get answered?  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  What did we do to deserve this?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  It's magical.  So I'm laying there.  Holy shit.  Feeling...  You can feel the numbness moving up my arm from my hand.  And I go, if I'm fucking having a heart attack, I'm covered in needles, and I can't...  Like, I couldn't move. 
[02:35:00]  I just felt my arm going like this, like, shaking back and forth, but I couldn't get up.  So she comes back in, maybe another five minutes later.  How are we doing?  I'm going to get this out of my arm.  What's wrong?  I can't feel my arm.  I can't...  Whatever.  She goes, okay.  So she starts at my legs and starts...  I'm like, that one, that one.  I'm yelling.  She pulls it out.  Now it's bleeding.  Ah, she fucked up.  Right?  It's bleeding.  So she's coming over with some kind of...  It looks like a towelette.  Oh, man.  But it reeks of this medicine kind of smell. 
[02:35:30]  And she's scrubbing really fast.  And she goes, okay, there you go.  I go, no, my arm went numb.  She fucked up.  Hit the wrong place.  She hit a nerve or something.  No, she said, well, that's good, because that meant you're feeling something.  No, she's...  And I said, that's bullshit.  Oh, man.  She's covering her ass.  She fucked up.  She didn't know what she was doing.  Wow, that's fucking brutal.  Those things are supposed to go in easy, and you're not supposed to feel like that.  And then the ones taken out of my calf here and my ankle were also bleeding.  And it was like, it felt really hot.  Are they not supposed to bleed? 
[02:36:00]  Like, vagabunctions?  I never had...  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I did about five of these.  Well, she used to use fucking roofing nails.  I did it for stress, so obviously it didn't work.  So that was...  They never bled, though, you wrote.  Well, that's what happened...  Damn.  ...with the third treatment, so...  Did you say my arm feels like my skull?  No.  Pudding?  No.  No.  No.  No.  The word was no.  See?  No skull.  It's calling you a no skull.  I know.  When did the feeling come back? 
[02:36:30]  Maybe five minutes after.  Oh.  Were you relaxed that night at least?  Get a good night's sleep?  Anything?  God, that sounds like a waste of time.  I don't think that acupuncture did anything.  No, maybe you believe...  People swear by it, but I didn't see it.  A lot of people swear by it.  I don't see it doing anything.  Wow.  How's the one near your pubis?  I didn't feel anything.  There's nothing.  Pubis?  It's all dead.  I don't want anyone touching my...  It's all dead. 
[02:37:00]  Pubis.  No one's touching the pubis.  Oh, look at that.  They're talking about a map on TV, but they forgot a G.  Ah.  No, see, that's...  The Olivian convoy passes through.  Oh, wait a minute.  Oh, I see.  My geography is a little screwy these days.  So that was the third treatment I had.  And then there was one more...  Treatment?  Well, service, whatever they call it.  Spa service.  Beheading?  Wait, all right.  One more spa service.  So there's one more.  This one I never even heard of.  Massage, facial, acupuncture. 
[02:37:30]  And this one involves more electricity.  Electricity.  What?  A lot more electricity.  Is it an acupuncture or electricity?  No.  Okay.  A lot more electricity.  Oh, hold on.  I wish I remember the name of it.  Electrolysis.  You said no.  Do you grab onto electrodes with your hands?  No.  Huh?  Nothing goes on your ass, right?  No.  Okay.  And then you do it to your dick?  No.  Okay.  A lot more electricity.  Are there clips? 
[02:38:00]  Did you have...  No, there's no clips.  Nipple clips?  But there's...  Oh, are they pads?  Stick on pad electrodes?  Sort of, yeah.  And do they do it around your midsection?  And they go...  And try to make your muscles contract?  Yep.  All right.  Are you trying to lose weight?  That's like an old weight loss thing.  Where it's like, hey, instead of you moving the muscles by doing like crunches...  Right, right.  The electricity moves the muscles in.  You burn the fat.  Meanwhile, it doesn't work.  It's like strapping your legs onto an electric bicycle and letting the motor pedal your legs. 
[02:38:30]  You're not going to lose weight.  How lazy are people?  Very.  Pirate Film Co., also known as Chris from Wisconsin, writes,  Asshole bleaching?  Yes, he got his hair done.  Wow, man.  You fucking...  There was nothing else you can do.  Pampered yourself.  You really did pamper.  All right.  What...  I don't know.  I have no idea.  What was it?  Someone said psychotherapy.  Oh, yeah.  They put a fucking...  They put a towel in his mouth and fucking put two electrodes to his temples. 
[02:39:00]  No, it's the one where they put the electrodes on his abdomen and make the electricity go.  What is that for?  It's supposed to contract and expand and contract your abdominal muscles.  It's supposed to help you take...  Digest?  No, it's supposed to help...  It's for...  Gout?  For size.  It's supposed to help you reduce your waist size and your stomach and all that.  What the hell?  You're on fucking vacation. 
[02:39:30]  Did the ship's lights dim?  We got enough oil out to fuel the ship.  Yeah, the ship slowed down to two knots.  Yeah, the ship was tipping over and stuff.  Oh, chip now.  I don't know what to do with that.  Wait, I had something there.  But that doesn't make sense because then right after the treatment you're going for the gourmet cupcakes.  Yes, the gourmet cupcakes. 
[02:40:00]  He's eating while they're doing the treatment.  He figures I just want to stay even.  God, that's fantastic.  So what were they trying to say?  One treatment, you're going to lose a little weight?  Well, they always try to coax you into multiple treatments for it.  But I figured I'd try the one and after the one I was like, yeah, I'm not coming back to this.  But here's how it starts.  So you have to strip out of your clothes.  Were you completely naked?  No, they give you disposables on display. 
[02:40:30]  They give you disposable shorts.  Like underwear kind of thing.  It's called a diaper.  It looks like a hairnet, but just for down here.  And then they need a roomy one for your cock.  Yes, it was very bulging.  Oh, God damn.  So you're standing there in these disposable shorts and then now they're painting you with cement. 
[02:41:00]  Like this bluish green cement stuff.  And they have these little, those, uh...  Go ahead.  I was just going to say that they...  I know.  Trying to make a...  Whale color?  No, not whale color.  I wouldn't say that.  Yeah.  So they put those, uh...  What are they called?  Those...  Electrodes.  Electrode things on you.  Yeah.  Then they lay you down on this bed here in what looks like a huge open diaper with the other cement on the other side. 
[02:41:30]  And you lay down into it.  They have the electrodes on you with the electrodes now in your back from laying in the cement on that diaper thing.  And then they put a cover over you.  So they're explaining what this does.  And then they said, okay, we're going to dial up the...  The voltage?  Yeah, the voltage.  It's supposed to just, like, it goes in different patterns.  So it's supposed to constrict different muscles in your stomach. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  So it starts off this, this, like, here's going, and this is pressing down, this is pressing down.  No, that feels fine.  Okay, let's try ten.  Boom.  Now you're like, okay, this is in bed.  And then it feels like someone just punched you right in the stomach.  Because this one just goes...  It goes like this.  And you see your body, like, convulsing because it goes...  Yeah, because the electricity is contracting your muscles.  Yeah.  Like, you're fucking...  And then up here, like, by your ribcage, it starts going nuts. 
[02:42:30]  And then it goes back down.  And you can't control yourself.  You're just...  So you're having a convulsion.  And being electrocuted.  You're paying for a convulsion while you're being electrocuted on your cruise.  Instead of just putting your iPod on and going to the gym.  Yeah, no kidding.  So...  He rocks.  He has some sounds of his vacation.  So, you know, you get done and they wipe you off and take everything off. 
[02:43:00]  And then they go to measure you and say, look, you lost an inch and a half.  Oh, fucking asshole.  And I'm like, that's good for now, but it's just because your muscles are now sticking to...  They're tight.  Yeah, they're real tight.  But they said, you come back in 24 hours and you get another treatment.  Oh, great.  But that means just in 24 hours, the muscles relax and you go back to where you were.  Right.  Yeah.  So...  What building did they build with the cement they took off of you? 
[02:43:30]  I'm sorry, you're right.  That sounds, by the way, painful.  It was.  It starts off nice and you're like, oh, it's tingly.  And then they just jack up the voltage and it's just constantly electrocuting you and your muscles are just freaking out.  Yeah, yeah.  Not for me.  Not worth...  Not for me.  Nah.  The money that I think it costs almost $300.  I could not imagine being so bored on a cruise ship that you have to do that.  I don't know.  You're a...  Just go to the gym.  You're an adventurer.  Yeah, man. 
[02:44:00]  It'll be fun.  Music playing.  Kenny, sir.  Can I talk about somebody else?  Yeah.  It's one of the best things you do.  I'm disappointed that Sam combed out his hair.  Yeah.  Did he?  Yeah, he did.  Yeah, he had dreadlocks, I heard.  You can't comb out dreadlocks.  You did.  You can't comb them out.  You did.  Yeah, no.  I was told that you had dreadlocks yesterday and then you combed out your hair for it.  I don't know why I didn't come to work with the dreadlocks that I saw yesterday. 
[02:44:30]  You can't comb out dreadlocks.  This is called the worst saying in radio history.  I don't know why...  I call up soda candy.  Turn your head sideways, let me see.  Yeah, so you had dread...  No, you still have the little...  It's little curly things, but it's still puffy.  Yeah, you had dreadlocks yesterday when I saw you.  It's the exact hair that I've always had.  I've never had dreadlocks.  I saw them yesterday.  No, you didn't.  I don't know why Kenny decided you didn't bring this up now, but...  Neither do I.  No, I was all excited when I saw your Twitter.  Yeah.  I wanted to see Sam in dreadlocks today and he combed them out.  You can't comb them out. 
[02:45:00]  Well, you got rid of them.  They didn't exist.  You made it up.  No, I didn't.  You lie on your Twitter all the time.  I never lie.  You lie, Peewee.  Everything I put up there is...  God's honest?  It's the honest truth.  No, it's not.  Dead horses, dead guys under trees, it's all real.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't know anything about any of that.  You had dreadlocks yesterday.  By the way, the dead guy under the tree, I've seen better Bigfoot photos.  It's quite an experience. 
[02:45:30]  I don't doubt it.  Yeah.  Very compelling.  I was looking, going, ah, it's...  It's a guy.  Sure it is.  It's a guy.  Positive.  Yeah.  Yeah, we heard all about it.  Yeah.  On the news.  On the news?  Oh, that's right.  They must have missed that body under a tree.  Well, they're still investigating.  Ah, right.  Mm-hmm.  Anything else about the cruise?  Hey.  I think that's about it.  Red nose, dyed hair.  Yeah.  Try to lose weight quickly. 
[02:46:00]  Electrocution.  Electrocution.  Guard attack.  Blackjack.  Yeah.  Gourmet cupcakes.  Facial.  Yeah.  And bingo.  And bingo, bingo, bingo.  And you won money.  Yeah.  Blackjack.  Blackjack.  Very cool.  Good.  Sounds like a good vacay.  See, that tree fucked up that house, though, huh?  So much for getting out of the way of the hurricane.  This was Greenville, North Carolina, by the way.  When trees fall over in storms, man, they sure take a lot underneath, don't they?  It's not like the tree just falls over.  It's like, yeah, we're going to take half the street, the sidewalk. 
[02:46:30]  It rips up the sidewalk.  About 100 square feet of lawn.  Yeah.  It's on my YouTube channel if you want to check it out.  That's a dead guy, though.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't notice at the time, but it's a dead guy.  They're debating it right now.  Go back.  You'll see the dead guy.  I'll show you all.  Right there.  Pause that.  See?  Right there.  Pause at 22.  Everyone knows at this point to pause at 22.  There, look.  Because Iraq is going back to his post. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, there's a dead guy.  That is anything.  What do you mean?  Is it two legs wrapped around the branch with black shoes on?  Look closely.  That's a dead guy.  I didn't see it moving.  What is it, though?  I mean, are those legs we're looking at?  I think so.  With black shoes on.  Now, why would people just leave him there and not put a blanket on him?  I went out early in the morning in Greenville, North Carolina to check out the damage.  I guess they didn't find him yet. 
[02:47:30]  Maybe he wasn't dead.  Did you report it?  No, I only discovered that afterwards.  After what words?  You should have reported it.  After I had it online.  Well, why didn't you call the cops the second you saw it and say,  I think there's a body under a tree?  I didn't see it until it was posted.  For the same reason he posted that I had dreadlocks.  You had dreadlocks?  Yes.  Yesterday.  When I was at your birthday.  And, of course, the dead pony.  How was the birthday party?  It was a blast.  How come we weren't invited?  I invited you.  Did you?  Yeah.  You said you were going to Nick DiPaolo's. 
[02:48:00]  Oh, Nick actually canceled.  Oh, Nick had his barbecue.  No, he had canceled a couple weeks ago.  I didn't know it.  I watched Sam open up toys.  He's 28 today?  Yeah, today.  And you were opening up toys yesterday.  And it said on the box for six and up.  Yeah.  He gets toys for his birthday.  Dolls.  You get dolls.  Like dolls.  Where'd you get them?  I had to throw some cash in my car quickly.  I just got home the day before. 
[02:48:30]  It's six and up.  It's not six to whatever.  His toys say six and up.  It should, even if it said six and up.  That doesn't, you're not the up part.  It means you can go as long as you can.  No, you're not the up part.  No, it's six to 106.  No, it's not.  You show me a box.  It says six and up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That sounds hot.  I might have a video of that.  I might post that later.  Six to as high as you want to go.  You're a baby.  I'm not a baby.  Sam, the only thing I will admit, you did have dreadlocks. 
[02:49:00]  That's true.  No, whatever.  That is a dead guy, I think.  It's on my YouTube channel.  Seems like it.  The horse was not dead.  What?  The horse was not dead.  Come on now.  All the other horses were looking at it and they were so sad.  Did I get you on that one?  Yeah, I thought it was at least injured.  That's the only one people believed.  Waiting to die.  The horse was not dead for the people that followed me while I was on vacation.  Was he just resting in the water? 
[02:49:30]  He was just chilling out.  I don't know what to believe anymore.  He just wanted to lay down in the little water washing room?  Well, the water started coming up a little bit and when the first wave or whatever hit  him, he said, fuck this and got up.  The wild horses of the Outer Banks.  The horse was not dead.  And I think I got Ronnie B on that motherfucker.  Really?  And I got that Jen Broad from Martha's channel.  The horse was not dead.  Because everybody was very sad.  Well, the horses were looking at it like, what the fuck? 
[02:50:00]  They looked like, oh, could someone help him?  We just have hooves.  It was on my Twitter.  You can't administer any medication with our hooves.  That was way back on my Twitter.  Good luck finding it.  That's a while ago now.  But the horse was not dead.  Yeah.  The sea turtle was, though.  That was really sad.  Dead sea turtle.  Who cares?  Did you see the sea turtle?  Fucking kick it.  Stupid thing.  It was spray painted.  I didn't understand why.  And then someone explained to me because savages will fucking just cut out the shell in front 
[02:50:30]  of everyone, horrifying everyone to take the shell.  So they spray paint them to make them obsolete.  Yeah.  Then they're useless then.  You can't fucking do anything with a spray painted fucking shell.  Why do they care what they do once they're dead?  I don't know.  But once a turtle's dead, make a fucking army helmet out of it.  Make a fucking bowl to hold nuts and trinkets in out of its shell.  I would kill one just to make a fucking bowl and put fake apples in.  A turtle bowl.  A turtle shell bowl.  Dust that shitty bowl I made before I throw it out. 
[02:51:00]  Keep going.  Where's the...  Right there.  This horse...  Ah, shit.  It's on my Facebook, too.  It's everywhere.  Yeah.  He looks dead.  It looks dead because of how the horses are looking really sad.  Like, now what?  We don't have hands.  We can't fucking carry them away.  Was he doing the roly-poly thing in the sand?  He looked dead for a while.  Yeah?  Yeah.  We thought it might have been dead, but it popped back up.  I'll tell you that.  The horse was dead.  It looked like a little baby.  Yeah.  It was.  A little guy.  He's a little guy.  Oh, good.  I was worried for him. 
[02:51:30]  I knew you were a horse lover.  Yeah, the little guy.  I knew that one might bother you.  Everything else, real.  Sam's dreadlocks are real.  Dead sea turtle, real.  And dead guy, possibly, because I didn't notice at the time under the tree.  I also got a shirt for my birthday.  It wasn't just action figures.  What kind of shirt?  You saw it.  It's like a shirt.  I didn't see the shirt.  Oh, no.  Who's on it?  Nobody's on it.  Some people refer to them as blouses.  Blouses.  Kenny is so loopy. 
[02:52:00]  He's so loopy.  Blouses.  I did see that you were scolding your mom because she ruined a shirt of yours while she's doing  your laundry at 28 years old.  I didn't scold her.  She wanted to know the make and the model because now she's going to go replace it.  She's asking about her laundry machine not working.  And you were bothered by it.  Her laundry machine?  Yeah, her laundry machine.  What is that?  It's a machine that does the laundry.  Isn't that called a washing machine?  It's called a woman.  It's called a what? 
[02:52:30]  A woman.  A machine that does the laundry.  He didn't have cornrows.  It was full dreadlocks yesterday.  I don't know what the fuck he did, but it's gone now.  Well, if you post any video you took yesterday, people are going to see that you were lying,  so you can't post.  I wasn't lying.  There's no dreadlocks in my hair.  I'm not lying.  I'm not lying.  For the show.  For the show.  For the show.  Horse not dead.  Thought it was gone. 
[02:53:00]  Thought it was a gonna.  I got a tie, too, so.  You did get a tie.  Grown up for a tie.  Yeah, that's right.  And, uh.  Interesting.  That's right.  When are you going to wear it?  When there's a formal occasion.  You don't go to formal occasions.  Sometimes I go to people's weddings.  I think you do.  Hopefully you wear it for job interviews.  Oh, shit.  Hopefully it's the last thing you ever put on before you fucking leave a note somewhere.  I kill myself in my birthday tie.  Yeah. 
[02:53:30]  They're making Sam do another new show this week.  Nobody's making me do anything.  They make you do this stuff.  Really?  No one in their right mind would work this hard for free.  Yeah, you came in on a holiday.  Yeah.  That's crazy.  Nobody's making me do anything.  What are they making you do now, Sam?  Nothing.  Oh.  That's what we do all day.  Yeah, really.  Why are you copying us?  We're taking our jobs.  What's the new gig?  I'm filling in this week for comedy by request.  Oh, so you take the request? 
[02:54:00]  Noon on Raw Dog.  Yeah.  Are you doing the phone show?  No.  That's the phone show.  Yeah.  Is it live or are you pre-recorded?  No, it's live.  I mean, people call in and request that.  When did you pre-record this?  Yeah, come on.  It's not pre-recorded.  You can call in and request bits.  Oh, hush.  And then how do you get to the bits?  What do you got to be like?  Well, the calls are screened.  Wait, were you on yesterday?  Oh.  So while one bit is playing...  Were you on yesterday?  No, I wasn't on yesterday.  So while one bit is playing, what you're saying is they record the calls and then they set  up the music.  It's an uncensored channel.  We don't have to record the calls. 
[02:54:30]  Well, just so it's easy to fucking...  And it's comedy.  It's comedy by request.  It's not music.  It's comedy bits.  I'm suspicious.  I am, too.  There's nothing to be suspicious of.  I don't believe anything in radio anymore.  It's a fake show.  It's a drivel.  And you're pre-recorded.  Yes.  All right, well, listen today and call in and see if it's pre-recorded.  They're all employees who call in.  Yeah.  It's all set up calls.  Yeah.  Hi, this is Troy Gwan.  Yeah.  What?  Hey, I want to hear this bit.  Do you got it?  Do you got it?  Do you got it? 
[02:55:00]  Wait a minute.  I know who you are.  I know you.  Wait a minute.  Roland likes to prank call every single show I do, so he'll be able to tell you what  Oh, he does?  Oh, yes.  What did Roland do on vacation?  Why didn't we find out about Roland yet?  Roland moved.  That was about it.  Roland moved.  More than you did.  Fat jokes.  He was relaxing in a diaper full of concrete, apparently.  Yeah, that's a weird one.  That's the oddest little...  I get the facial, maybe even a little acupuncture, massage, but I don't know. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah.  All right, we're going to go to break.  John Sterling has brand new home run calls for a brand new guy.  Oh, thank goodness.  You know Jesus Montero?  Jesus?  Jesus.  Does he say Jesus or Jesus?  I think he says Jesus.  All right, we're going to find out next.  Or just Zeus.  Zeus.  Right?  Just call him Zeus.  You know what?  Like no holes in the barge.  And boy, I think he had back-to-back home runs.  He's a rookie, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's his first two major league homers.  Fuck. 
[02:56:00]  We're going to find out about the home run calls next.  We're going to find out what Roland did on vacation.  And you know, guys, we're all working for the weekend, aren't we?  We are, right?  We are.  We are, right?  Everyone's watching.  Let's see what you're doing.  I like to sing, man.  I'll sing a little bit.  Everyone's watching to see what you do.  Everyone's looking at you. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, everyone's wondering where you come out tonight.  Everyone's trying to get it right.  Oh, everyone's working for the weekend.  Everyone's working on the weekend. 
[02:57:00]  Everybody's working for the weekend.  Everybody's working for the weekend.  You want a piece of my heart?  This is the Virus Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show.  First day back from vacation. 
[02:57:30]  Yay.  And Sam pointed out that Bladder has a mullet.  Why would you point that out, Sam?  He's your boss.  He's the guy that's going to give you the raise eventually.  Eventually.  So, it's not going to help your cause by pointing out that he has a fucking, I don't know, mullet what he's doing with it.  You said I have dreadlocks.  I don't know what anybody's doing with their hair.  You had dreadlocks yesterday.  Well, I don't know anything about anybody's hair.  Hey, E-Rock.  You going to do some Facebook updating today for everybody?  Yes.  I will take care of all...  What's the show's Facebook?  I don't know. 
[02:58:00]  It's Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  Okay, so you'll link to all the shit we talked about today.  Dead horses and your bikini teenies and Club Soda Canning on the little scooter.  Yes, everything will be up there.  Everything being atrophied on my couch and adding nothing to the vacation discussion.  Although, you did tweet a picture of E-Rock's new dyed hair.  Yes, I did.  That'll be up there as well.  I did nothing.  So, a lot of the stuff we talked about today will be on the Facebook page.  It's not dyed.  Actually, there are pictures of me fueling up the generators during my five-day power outage. 
[02:58:30]  Then let's do that, too.  Yeah, why not?  So, go to our Facebook page today and you'll be linked to a lot of the shit we talked about,  all right?  Right, right, right, right, right.  And there'll be a picture of me and the Kardashians later?  Whoa.  You're going to stick around for that picture?  Of course.  That's a big one.  Yeah.  Yeah, why not?  Yeah, why not?  I hate them.  I love them.  I don't like the Kardashians.  Why?  I watch the show every Sunday.  I mean, most of them are all nice.  What is good about the show?  It's fine.  They sit around on their Blackberries and they don't do nothing. 
[02:59:00]  It's like us.  I thought you were going to say something else.  They sit around on their Blackberries.  Did you see the clip of her losing her dumb fucking earring?  Yeah, but they found it.  Thank God, right?  Yeah.  Did you see this clip?  Showing what kind of a person she is?  Yeah, just losing her fucking mind.  And then her dumb now husband came and at least tried to dive and go look for it.  He's just staring in the water like, I don't know what to do.  And she cried that she got a presidential suite.  What? 
[02:59:30]  She cried because they gave her a presidential suite.  And she didn't want that big of a room.  Really?  Yeah.  Why?  I don't know.  She's just a normal gal.  Did she really get married or is that all bullshit?  She sold the whole wedding to USA.  It is bullshit?  No, I don't know.  What are you hearing, Rowan?  Boy, Rowan knows something.  Well, they made $80 million off the wedding or something like that.  Who did?  $80 million they made.  It doesn't seem like it was a real wedding.  What the fuck are they up to?  Because all the picture rights, exclusive rights and all that, they sold individually. 
[03:00:00]  They sound pretty smart, actually.  The mom, yeah.  You want to see this video real fast, Dad?  Because the Kardashians are coming to SiriusXM.  Start it over.  So Chris Humphreys, I guess, the fake husband.  He's doing a prank on her.  Because this is a reality show.  So the fake husband throws Kim Kardashian in the water and what, Bora Bora?  Yeah, she hurts her head, too.  It's the show.  Why am I repeating a really good line?  Very good.  Hit it. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, no.  Was it just playing?  Yeah, it was.  It was, right?  Oh, it's the computer?  Yes, it is.  No, it really is.  Computer.  Computer.  See, God doesn't...  It doesn't matter.  Pause, play, who cares?  God doesn't want us to hear that right now, so that's fine.  Home run calls from John Sterling?  Yeah, I heard there were some good ones.  New guy?  Yeah.  You still following the Yankees, then?  Zeus.  Yeah.  Are they going to win it all this year?  Yeah, I'm predicting a Yankee.  No, I don't think they're going to win it this year.  Baseball doesn't matter because football starts this weekend. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  Jets for me, Cowboys for Jimmy, and nobody for you, right, Ant?  No, I'm not a football guy.  I'll watch it.  Jets.  I'm a big fan of the game.  Kenny, football?  All right.  No.  Kenny, you don't like watching football?  I don't have time.  You should do.  What are you doing on Sunday afternoon?  I go to the gym.  So go after, or before.  And put it on the TV in the gym.  Yeah. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, it's like a whole day thing, and you have to know statistics.  Well, you know, you don't have to know shit.  Just watch where the ball goes.  It's fucking easy.  Kenny, you don't even watch football?  What do you do?  What does he do?  Nothing.  You've got to enjoy yourself.  He basks in other people's misery.  That's it?  Yeah.  If you had to pick a team, who would you pick?  The Giants, because where I live.  You don't get emotional about sports?  No, and I would like the Yankees. 
[03:02:00]  He does get emotional for UFC.  I've seen that.  Yeah.  He likes the UFC.  That's only because I fight.  I like to fight.  Yeah, so.  Okay.  I'm just past my prime now.  And Ant, you're not going to hear this.  Hockey right around the corner.  Holy shit.  The longest season I've ever seen.  Hockey is around the fucking corner.  Basketball, not so much.  I don't really care as much, but the Knicks should be all right.  A little better this year.  We have one of the greatest running backs in history tomorrow. 
[03:02:30]  Very psyched.  Emmitt Smith tomorrow.  Really?  Yeah.  Emmitt Smith.  From Cowboys.  Yeah, he's leading rusher of all time.  And he's got a book out, I hear.  Yeah.  I didn't know he was coming tomorrow.  It's a self-help kind of book.  Wow, he'd be out of touch.  Yeah, he's tomorrow.  Didn't he win Dancing with the Stars?  He did, but I didn't watch.  I know him from football.  I don't watch that show.  You know, a man's sport.  Exactly.  Does Chez Bono?  She's really.  It's this thing, really.  She with a beard.  She's going to be doing the Dance with the Stars?  That's a joke, right?  But the fact that people are outraged is like, well, if you watch. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah, who gives a fuck?  That's that middle America that watches that dumb fuck show anyway.  So like, oh, didn't that thing used to have a virgin?  Everyone who dances is pretty much gay.  The fucking, all the professional dancers.  What about that Nancy Grace?  Is she doing it?  Or is that a rumor?  No, she is.  She's good.  I hate her.  What is she fucking going to do?  Here's my new dance move called The Toch Mom.  Yeah.  Toch Mom.  And Brother Kardashian's doing it.  What?  Rob Kardashian.  I don't know who he is.  Just another boar from that family. 
[03:03:30]  God, jeez.  And are we ready to admit that Khloe Kardashian is Bruce Jenner's daughter?  Biological daughter?  Yeah.  Did you see the wedding photos?  Is that pretty much, you can tell?  That's what I'm saying.  In the face.  Jimmy, when you get the picture today, go, look, Bruce Jenner's your father.  Your biological father, right?  When is it going to come out?  He was.  Go to the USA wedding pictures.  They have the other two daughters that Bruce Jenner had with his other broad, what's her  name?  Becky Sue Jenner.  Becky Sue Jenner. 
[03:04:00]  What's Bruce's wife's name?  Chris?  The Kardashian one's Chris.  All right.  Go to the one with just the daughters.  And you tell me that Khloe is 100% related to Kim Kardashian.  And what's the other one?  Kourtney, right?  So now, are you telling me that he was banging her then, the wife, when Robert Kardashian was  still with her?  I have no doubt in my mind, but no one is fucking talking about this, Ann.  Well, do tell.  Go to the one that's just all the sisters. 
[03:04:30]  She looks more like her two sisters that Bruce and Kris Jenner had.  Oh, why so many black guys in these pictures?  Boy, they sure do like their black children.  Now you've got to go, USA Today had the exclusive shit on this.  Yeah, what happened?  Come on.  When I see the Kardashians, I'm going to go, what are you guys keeping up with somebody?  Us Magazine, I mean, Sam, sorry. 
[03:05:00]  Jimmy's going to get a picture, though.  Yeah.  Tell them, what are you keeping up with all the time?  Is it all adjusted, arranged and everything?  You're going to...  I think we should be okay.  Yeah?  No problems?  I think so.  30 days till hockey.  30 days?  It just ended.  30 days till hockey.  You're going to have to hear our Islander bullshit again, Ann.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Ahead of time.  I'm really, really sorry.  I don't mind.  Being from Long Island, it's kind of okay anyway to hear.  I'm just not really, you know, a fan. 
[03:05:30]  You didn't vote for the fucking arena then.  I certainly didn't.  Motherfucker.  But watch, it'll get built.  Look, this was a throwaway thing.  Look at my words.  It's taking too long now.  But anyway...  It's crazy.  Chloe is a giant next to her two sisters that supposedly are all related to the Kardashian  guy there.  And then there's these two other daughters, and she looks more like them.  And those daughters have Bruce Jenner as the father.  Bruce Jenner blood.  If you find the picture before you get out of here, pop it on.  Whatever.  Who can tell what Bruce Jenner looks like anymore? 
[03:06:00]  Or anyway.  He has a plastic face.  He'll look at his old pictures and see, ah, does she look like that?  Because, yeah.  He's all a plastic face.  No, it's the fact that Bruce Jenner's really tall.  He was an athlete and all that.  We all know that.  And she's really fucking tall.  Yeah.  And the daughters, Kim Kardashian, is tiny.  They're really short.  And Robert Kardashian was a little pipsqueak.  Yeah.  What year did he win the...  He's been...  1970...  Mistake 72?  Mistake 72.  He's been famous as long as I can remember.  40 fucking years since he won the Olympics?  I would guess 72.  The decathlon?  Or was it 76? 
[03:06:30]  I don't know.  It was a big one.  It might have been 76.  I don't know.  You're going to go 76?  I don't even know.  76.  I just read it once.  76 twice.  Can't find it, huh?  Fuck.  Oh, well.  All right.  Here's the home run call.  Get Sam.  From John Sterling for Jesus Montero.  The 0-1.  Swung on and driven a deep right.  It is high.  Middle is far.  It is gone.  Jesus Montero has hit his first big league home run. 
[03:07:00]  We heard he was a great right center field hitter.  And he drove it deep in the seats in right.  Jesus is loose.  And the Yankees take a 9-8 lead.  And he's getting a standing ovation.  Wow.  That was almost a half a swing.  He used the power of that fastball.  Shut up.  What a stroke that was.  Why is everything so dramatic with her?  He used the power of the fastball. 
[03:07:30]  Jimmy literally threw his headphones off and walked out of the studio.  He left.  That means the Kardashians came early.  Who are you kidding?  Walked out of the studio.  No, he could not take.  Yeah.  Hey, Zeus.  Is on the loose or something?  Is on the loose.  Is loose.  What?  Is loose.  Hey, Zeus is loose.  Is loose.  Because then he builds on it in the next one.  Oh, he certainly does.  You really can't find that picture now?  I'm obsessed with it.  I don't think they posted it online. 
[03:08:00]  He really used the power.  That's my new favorite thing is including Susan's whatever she wants to say afterwards  that John Sterling never responds to.  Yeah, just not only the home run call.  You need her inane babble.  Oh, she's terrible.  Go to Kim Kardashian's website.  I think it might be KimKardashian.org, I believe.  Dot org.  And here's the second home run call from the same guy.  Here's the 2-2.  Swung on and driven a deep right. 
[03:08:30]  That ball is high.  It is far.  It is gone.  He has great right center field power.  It's the second consecutive home run.  The second home run of his major league career.  Hey, Zeus has been turned loose.  He hits his second home run.  A two-run blast.  And the Yankees have an 11-8 lead.  Well, maybe Jim Johnson won't throw up that fastball anymore.  And here's the dramatic. 
[03:09:00]  Well, maybe Jim Johnson won't throw up that fastball anymore.  Any more.  Sort of new.  Yeah, you're going to be a major league pitcher and not throw any fastball.  Don't throw that fastball.  Don't throw it ever.  Nah, nah.  Nah, don't do that now.  Jim Johnson won't throw up that fastball anymore.  What a piece of bidding that is.  Second home run of the season is done.  They're standing ovation here.  What an afternoon for this kid.  And they want him to come out again for another curtain call. 
[03:09:30]  Boy, this crowd is on its feet.  It's crowd is on its feet.  He's walking up and down the dugout.  Passada, no.  But just pushed him out.  That's great.  You ought to see this stadium.  They're just terrible.  She's my favorite person in the whole world.  She is so bad.  That voice could not be more annoying.  It's so annoying.  It really is.  She could be saying the greatest shit, which she's not. 
[03:10:00]  But with that voice, it's terrible.  Terrible.  Terrible.  That's got to be something, though, man.  Your first fucking Major League game, two homers like that for the fucking Yankees.  That's the start of a career that will just go down the shitter like so many that we've  seen in the past that have started off.  Yeah, you know how many people have hit a home run in their first game?  Wow, amazing.  We're looking at the Yankee royalty in the making.  Who?  What?  Single A ball. 
[03:10:30]  Who the what the fuck?  By next year.  Yeah.  You'll be like, what?  Oh, yeah.  He's playing for the fucking Orioles.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, you know what it is.  How was your vacation, Travis?  Was it good?  Yeah, it was good.  I evacuated to Anthony's house for a few days during the hurricane.  Yeah, yes.  He was evac-ed over my house.  That was a lot of fun.  Bah!  With the generator going on.  We left right when the power went out.  Did your apartment get fucked up?  No.  Because you were in...  Yeah, we're in Rockaway.  Yeah, you were in the eye. 
[03:11:00]  Some of them did, but not ours, luckily.  Oh, good for you.  Oh, that is true, because they did have to evac with child and dog.  Yeah.  Dexter came with us.  Dexter came over, and I believe it was within the first half hour, hour that Dexter was over,  that Dexter dropped a nugget of shit on my carpet.  No, it was on the carpet.  Well, no, it was on the floor right in front of the fireplace, I believe.  As I was picking him up, yeah.  And I was just like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[03:11:30]  But then everything else went just great.  Then it went swimmingly.  But, oh, boy, was I ready to just draw and fire.  I had that.  I had another big bulldog.  I had a cat.  I was evacuating the entire South Shore.  We had a party.  It was over my house, the entire South Shore.  And, yeah, yeah, the animals got me a little nervous.  Kids were adorable.  Lil Riley.  Yeah, she had a good time.  She definitely has fun. 
[03:12:00]  She never wants to leave the house.  No, she doesn't.  And then when she gets back,  she has to go back to Uncle Auntie's house.  Yeah, Uncle Auntie.  Auntie.  Yeah.  She gets Anthony.  She likes to pull.  She swims in the pool.  She likes to pull.  It was good.  We had fun.  We had fun.  Good, good, good.  And then I sat and watched bad television for five days  with the droning of a fucking generator.  And I just smelt like gas for five days.  Smelt like gasoline.  I imagine you would.  For five days, you cannot pour that much gasoline 
[03:12:30]  in and out of containers with the exhaust of the generator  without completely smelling like a fucking diesel mechanic constantly.  Then I went to do a compound show,  and it was like two in the morning.  I was hammered, and I pulled such a Davey Mac.  Like, I thought it would be a great idea to call Ron Bennington.  And he called him up at two in the morning.  And he called.  He answered on the first ring. 
[03:13:00]  First ring?  Yeah.  But he was just like...  Someone's jonesing.  That's what I was saying.  I'm like, what is he doing?  First ring?  First ring.  Uh-oh.  It's like, well...  Check out Ronnie.  He's all right.  So I was inviting him to the party,  and he's like, well, you know, I'm out of state.  I'm about visiting family.  Because, yeah, my mom's right inside watching your show.  Yeah, sure.  Or, you know, being a smartass.  But he had to listen to a drunken me babble.  Like, he doesn't have enough problems with Davey Mac calling him drunk.  Hey, Mr. B. 
[03:13:30]  Mr. B, wonderful.  He was upset he didn't get to go to the compound party.  Yeah, Dave, I called the Sam and Dave show  just before they went off air.  Called us what?  Uh-huh.  Well, just kidding.  And it was a lot of fun talking with Dave.  He said Dave McDonald, and, of course, Sam.  No.  But he said Dave couldn't make it.  Apparently, he needs 48 hours' notice before he can go anywhere.  I talked to him on the phone.  Is that true?  And he said he needed a few days' notice before he can take a long drive somewhere 
[03:14:00]  to get mentally prepared.  This is bizarre.  I thought it was, like, logistically speaking, with, you know, a kid and babysitters and things  like that.  But it's to get mentally prepared for a long drive.  He said he wanted, he was going to try to find a workaround, but he said the main problem  was...  A workaround?  You get in the car and drive.  He didn't...  That's right.  He said he needed a few days' notice before he could take a long drive.  And it was, like he said, I said, you just go to his house and crash and drive back tomorrow.  And he said, no, it's not a matter of, like, finding out how I'm going to get home. 
[03:14:30]  It's a matter of psychologically preparing for driving from Jersey to Long Island.  He is such a weirdo.  He said, whatever, dude, I love him, but what a weirdo he is.  That's funny.  Yeah.  What do you say, Ope?  I'm thinking...  Still got a minute and a half.  We do something called getting the fuck out of here.  You still got over a minute.  Do we?  How about that?  How long is that, Ope?  A minute 39. 
[03:15:00]  That means a little overtime for everybody.  We're putting in a little overtime.  That's right.  We'll see you tomorrow.  What's worse than a hot Italian?  Man, I am so lost.  I need directions.  What the fuck?  Maybe that stereotypical Italian could help me.  Oh, what the fuck?  Hey, man, I was wondering if you could help me out.  I'm not from around here.  I'm from Utah.  Utah.  What the fuck is that?  It's west of here.  Anyway, do you think you can give me directions to the Apollo Theater?  No.  No.  You can't talk.  You can't talk.  It's too crowded. 
[03:15:30]  What do you mean crowded?  Can you say the N-word a little bit?  No.  No.  Can I say the N-word?  No, we can't say the N-word.  What the fuck?  Come on, man.  What are you, racist or something?  This is my accent.  This is my accent.  All right.  All right.  I just say fuck you in Jewish.  Trust me.  Trust me.  Dude, what the fuck, man?  Are you serious?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  I said, what the fuck?  I know.  You said, what the fuck?  You said, what the fuck a thousand times already.  That's all you say.  What was I talking about?  I just figured what the fuck I was talking about.  I just figured out what the fuck I was talking about.  Um, your blatant racism? 
[03:16:00]  Ah, yeah.  Oh, how come Polish girls don't like dildos?  Because their teeth fall out.  What the fuck?  Wow.  Just, just, just wow.  All right.  If I'm facing east, now which, which way do I got to go?  Nah, I, stop from the bottom, bottom, top, top and bottom.  I don't know what the fuck I would do.  What?  I don't know.  What?  It's an elf.  I can't, I, I cannot understand you.  Okay, like a minestrone.  Three languages.  I can't understand you.  No, no.  It's exciting.  It's exciting. 
[03:16:30]  Hey, all of you.  I've had enough of this.  I'm going to get the fuck out of here.  What the fuck is?  I'm getting the fuck out of here.  The fuck out of here.  I'm gone, you mumbling asshole.  What are you, retarded?  It's possible.  The virus, Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the O.P. and Anthony Show continues.  Continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  All right, I'm ready for my surprise. 
[03:17:00]  There's, there's balloons or, like, a cake.  Somebody to sing or, I don't know, like, a gift.  Anyway, I mean, it's after O.P. and Anthony Live.  My name's Sam Roberts.  I guess I just thought there would be some kind of celebratory thing.  I know it's the first day back from vacation and all, but I thought this would kind of be 
[03:17:30]  like a big, here it is, but the hallway's empty.  Nobody in the room.  I guess I'm just, so when are you guys going to jump out or Eric's not at, oh, yes, he is.  You there, Eric?  No?  Hmm.  I thought he'd be there, but.  I'm here.  Oh.  I was just waiting for, is there, like, a surprise, or?  Uh, why would there be a surprise?  What?  I mean, we were talking with, well, I guess, I was just talking guest stuff with, uh, with 
[03:18:00]  Roland.  I wasn't paying attention.  What are we doing?  I guess never mind, then.  I mean, we could talk about the show.  What happened?  I mean.  How are you doing?  The show was good.  How are you doing?  Well.  I just thought that there, I mean, never mind.  I thought that, no, go ahead, go ahead.  No, I, I.  Because it's, I mean, because we don't, no, can I all be mentioned where, you know, my.  Well, I had almost two hours in the show today describing my vacation.  Yeah, I know. 
[03:18:30]  It was a little, like, it was a little overboard.  I mean, your vacation was very interesting.  You had a lot of great stories.  But towards the end there, I kind of felt like I was watching, uh, somebody's vacation slide  show.  And I was like, all right, I get it.  He was on a cruise.  But I'm not.  Well, he kept giving me the, uh, you know, the stretch it out symbol.  So I'm like, okay, I did this too.  Was he just flashing you notes?  Like, look at the clock, Eric.  They all were.  Keep going.  Keep going.  They had, they had a whole, uh, array of, uh, weight jokes and killing time until they 
[03:19:00]  had to leave.  So.  That was it.  They just looked at you and they were like, there he is.  Just keep going.  Every time I was getting ready to put my headphones down and, you know, back the chair out to  walk out of the studio.  No, no.  Stretch.  Stretch.  So.  Oh yeah, I did this too on the vacation.  How long?  Because at first when you came in, they pretended like they were bringing you in to talk.  But how long did it take for you to realize that they were only bringing you in to ask  you about your hair?  After this, well, the, here, the, uh, second and third time they kept saying died.  I'm like, okay, what are they getting at?  Died.  Who died?  Nobody.  Did I say somebody died? 
[03:19:30]  And then I'm like, oh, okay.  Like, cause I kept saying Kenny had somebody die and I thought there was something that  was relating to me on that.  And then it took a little while to figure out it was, uh, my stupid hair.  Cause we all noticed that like, even though you had the hat on, we were like, like,  Oh, you didn't say it?  No.  Here you go.  Who's that in there, Derek?  That was Derek.  How's Derek doing?  Derek just went, ugh.  Well, that's the thing.  You have to realize, I mean, Eric, you've been working here long enough to know that  whenever you make a physical change, whether it's positive or negative, you're going to 
[03:20:00]  be mocked for it.  Yeah.  So it doesn't even matter.  It's not even a good gauge of whether or not it works or not.  No.  But it's better to have that than to, uh, why didn't you fucking do anything on the vacation?  You have no stories.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, that's true.  Are you happy with the way?  Cause Eric, uh, put, what was it?  Sun in, in his hair.  Yeah.  Uh, and we all noticed it cause you came in and with a gray hat on today.  Yeah.  Um, but I mean, I noticed and Travis noticed, I think Danny noticed too, the, uh, the blonde 
[03:20:30]  hair coming out the back.  So we were like, okay, he's hiding.  He's got something under that hat.  Um, and your hair when it, where it was a brown color is now strawberry blonde.  I, I call it strawberry blonde.  It looks like shiny gold.  I mean, yeah, it doesn't look natural.  It's very metallic.  It doesn't look like a natural strawberry blonde.  No, it doesn't.  It is a little metallic.  Um.  It looks almost like Japanime.  What were you going for?  Uh, I was just trying to get blonde highlights in, in my hair and then it just turned everything.  It just made everything shiny bronze. 
[03:21:00]  So I just said, wow, it's starting to turn.  So I just dumped the bottle on my head all, no, every time I went out just to, so that  it all matched.  You look rusted.  You look like your head has been rusted.  Yeah.  That's it.  That's, you look like, uh, the same color Abraham Lincoln's head is on the, uh, or hair  is on a penny.  Well, I'll leave it for a few days and cause my hair is getting a little long.  So, and I'll get it cut at the end of the week and then it'll just be the tips, just  frosted tips.  Yeah.  Um, you've wanted to dye your hair forever though.  Like I haven't, yeah, I haven't done, when was the last time?  It was when we started here at XM seven years ago. 
[03:21:30]  Once you, my hair was almost orange at that time.  When did you make a splash?  Why don't you come in here with dyed hair?  Like once you like have green hair or something.  Testing the waters.  I see.  And because if I came in like this, they're like, oh, okay.  Imagine if I came in balls to the wall.  That's what you should have done.  Totally different color.  Deep end first, dive right in.  You know what I mean?  You would have distracted from the vacation stories.  They were your stories anyway.  So it's like, well, now we can get an extra 15 minutes, you know?  Well, people were happy, you know, they didn't have to hear you all day. 
[03:22:00]  Why would you take a shot at me?  I'm not.  Just reading what it was, what it said on Twitter.  It said, yeah, you know, Sam, no Bobo.  That's not what it said on Twitter.  It did.  I have Twitter too, and that's not what it said.  From our good friend, WWE Joe Villa.  Yeah.  By the way, let me say this.  Oh, I don't know what that tweet meant last night.  You know what it meant?  I didn't watch, I wasn't watching Raw last night.  No, because I was tweeting, because on Raw last night, the WWE played a commercial for  the first time, announcing that they were going to have the network, the WWE network 
[03:22:30]  debuts in 2012.  Oh, cool.  And then I started tweeting, listen, WWE, what are you doing if I'm not on your network?  Are you serious, bro?  And then I started tweeting that I had different ideas I was writing down, and I was like,  seriously, let's get this going.  And Joe Villa, who knows us and who works for the WWE, thought it would be cute on the eve  of my special day to write, we're giving Eric a show. 
[03:23:00]  We're giving E-Rock Radio a show.  Look, I wasn't expecting it, but I'd be glad to accept it, and we'll figure out what to  do before the launch.  Well, if you need, like, a co-host or a sidekick, I'm available, Eric.  Well, I could use maybe a writer's assistant.  But, you know, a writer's assistant.  That'd be great.  That'd really, a dream come true.  Do you want to start off interning like you did here, and then work your way up?  No, I feel like I've paid some dues somewhere, I would hope.  Maybe not, though. 
[03:23:30]  You wouldn't want to intern for Vince?  I would be Vince McMahon's personal intern in a heartbeat.  Okay.  And I would do that if he was like, look, you have to take this position, but it's the  rest of your life.  Like, there's no upward mobility, and you can't, I'd say, that's fine.  And he gets to throw things at you.  I don't care.  Okay.  Throw things at me all day long.  But being your writer's assistant or your intern on your WWE E-Rocks Network show, that  doesn't work for me.  It's all my, it's a half hour show, and it's sort of interactive, you know, through social 
[03:24:00]  media and phone calls.  And I'll give you my wrestling predictions for upcoming Raw and SmackDown and pay-per-view  events.  And that's the show?  Yes.  That's what they bought?  This is exactly what you want to hear.  I mean, I would watch the show, let's be honest.  I would love to watch the show, because Eric's wrestling predictions are buffoon-like, but  you have to be a wrestling fan to understand the humor in them.  Because it's there for my entertainment, not what's good for the business.  Just horrible business.  Not what's good for the buy rates, merchandise, anything that, you know, that translates to 
[03:24:30]  money is not applied to my reasoning and to my predictions.  It's what I would like to see.  You'd think that somebody at Eric's age, who's been watching wrestling as long as he  has, would have some sense of what's good for the wrestling business, but he has no  clue.  Eric has absolutely no idea.  But what I was getting at was this Twitter thing that Joe Vila from the WWE said, it made  me, at first it hurt me, but then I was thinking about what Opie's been doing on Twitter lately. 
[03:25:00]  And it just seems like there are certain people, Opie Radio being one of them, that just feels  like Twitter is the place to lie.  He sent me a message saying, hey, did you get a chance to, did you get in Sam Hangout  over the vacation?  I said, no, I haven't, I didn't get a chance to see him.  And he goes, you got to see his new hair.  He sent you a message?  Yeah.  And I said, what's, what's with his hair?  And then he never responded back.  So I, like, I didn't know.  And then it shows up on Twitter that you had, you had dreads. 
[03:25:30]  He went, he was at my house.  I don't know why he shows up to my house anymore, but he was at my house.  Lots of baked goods.  I guess so, because I was having, like, a small family get-together, and I guess.  Did you invite him?  I guess my fiancé must have spoke to his wife.  That would be so great if he just kind of got, like, a hankering to go up there.  Or he was like, hey, I'm stopping.  And just totally random, just showed up at a family event.  Because as I said, it's like, look, I work for you.  I can't kick you out of my house, but you just keep showing up to these birthday parties.  But he showed up, and then all of a sudden, he started saying that I have dreadlocks. 
[03:26:00]  I mean, I just didn't, hang on.  I think the instant feedback, unless it's misleading me, you're on the air.  Sam, what was the menu for yesterday's birthday party?  And did Jess dress up in some Victoria's Secret outfit?  Oh, can I guess?  America wants to know.  Okay, thank you.  What's your name?  He hung up.  Can I guess one of the items?  Yeah.  Is it your mom's famous coconut chicken fingers? 
[03:26:30]  You always call them coconut chicken fingers.  It's sesame.  Oh, sesame chicken fingers.  Yes.  Sesame chicken fingers were around for everybody.  I was inviting.  And then my dad was on the grill.  And no, Jess did not wear a Victoria's Secret outfit.  I'm going to try one more time, because somebody is instant feedbacking in that they're trying to call in.  You're on the air.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday, dear Sam.  Happy birthday to you. 
[03:27:00]  Well, I'm glad you remembered, Lady Trucker.  That's very sweet of you.  Why would you say that?  She's doing something nice.  Thank you, Lady Trucker.  May the water take you away.  Why would you say that?  I hope you get caught in a big flood.  Everybody just hates Lady Trucker so much.  I don't even know her.  You just decided to destroy her.  Have you noticed the way Opie's been lying on Twitter?  Like, he was over, and you and Eric both didn't get invited to my house, because it was a small family get-together that Opie just shows up for. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah, we just got a dick in the ass, Eric.  I mean, if you were the boss, you could show up to my house without the risk of being kicked out, too.  But I think that because my fiancé is best friends with his wife, he feels like he can come to my house.  I could go drunk and make your party festive.  Be the one drunk guy at the party.  But he went on, and he started talking about me having dreadlocks, and then he goes on Twitter, and he goes, hey, check your Twitter. 
[03:28:00]  And all of a sudden, there's a hundred people replying to me, saying, oh, you have dreadlocks.  It was made up.  It was a lie.  It was a fabrication.  But you have dreadlocks on right now.  I do not.  And I mean, and this is something that, like, and then Opie said he's going to post a video that he took at my house, which is like, what happened to privacy?  But he...  He did say maybe, then he goes, I'll post it.  I'll post it.  Yeah, I mean, if it's a maybe, he's going to think about it, and then, okay, yeah, I'll post it. 
[03:28:30]  But you'll see in the video I don't have dreadlocks, and he's just insisting that I did.  Then we find out this horse thing, because he was in the Outer Banks for two weeks.  I thought it was real.  Everybody thought it was real.  There's no reason that any of us would think...  Why would anybody lie about that?  Was he really in the Outer Banks?  I don't know anymore, Roland.  I don't know.  I will say the tow truck line was intriguing and very funny.  What tow truck line?  Saying about the tow truck dragging the dead horse off the beach.  Yeah.  I mean, like, it made you believe.  Wouldn't you want to see that? 
[03:29:00]  I mean, you feel bad for the horse, but wouldn't you want to go just to see them drag it?  Well, yeah, and he just kept going with this horse, dead horse story, that you were like,  well, why?  Like, there was no...  Nobody ever thought to themselves that he made this up, because why would he?  Because he's a maniac that just wants to keep people guessing.  He just gets off on tricking people on Twitter.  But you go to his video that he posts on YouTube, and BuzzFeed reposted and everything, and it's  the video of, uh, is there a dead body under the tree that fell? 
[03:29:30]  And that's on...  I think that's on his Twitter, but it's also on his YouTube channel.  I'm putting it up, uh, in a minute on the, uh, ONA Facebook.  Okay, it's on his Facebook, Opie Radio Fans, it's on our Facebook, Opie and Anthony Show,  but, um, that appears to be real, because he went on the show today and admitted that  there is no, there was no dead horse, that he was lying about that.  Is there a hurricane?  I don't know, Roland.  It was raining in New Hampshire, that's all I know. 
[03:30:00]  Maybe there was no hurricane.  Oh, you didn't bring up your New Hampshire trip.  I didn't bring up anything about my vacation.  Oh, because nobody wanted to talk to you.  Exactly, it was not, it was not, but I was fine with that.  Well, let's talk about your New Hampshire trip.  Well, I'm trying to get to the bottom of this Opie thing right now.  Well, he, look.  He just lies.  But the thing, but there is a body in that video.  Like, you can see at the 22 second mark, it's wrapped around the limb of the tree.  It's a body.  Like, on BuzzFeed, they said it's just a branch.  But it's not.  There's a body under the tree.  Is it a dead body? 
[03:30:30]  I don't know.  Is it a tree?  I don't know.  Is he on the Universal Backlot Tour?  I don't know.  I know it is.  What?  He went on the cruise with Eric and his wife.  Eric, did Opie go with you and your wife on the cruise?  Um, no.  I don't know who to believe.  I don't know anymore, Rowan.  And, and...  Then when I say who's coming tomorrow, I'm like, oh no.  I can't believe that Eric's wife made the cruise.  Yeah.  I'm amazed at that, too, because I was telling...  She did tell me that she had an out, though, too. 
[03:31:00]  She had an out?  Yeah, they offered, like, first-class tickets to people for overbooked flights.  Oh, I see.  Well, they gave her...  But she wouldn't have been there on time.  They gave her a first-class...  Yeah.  Oh, they did?  They gave her a first-class ticket for the fourth flight that we got her on, because that  was the only seat left.  So they, uh, they just gave it to her and she got on.  Wow.  Well, I mean, that's, that's a pretty good deal.  So, I still am somewhat confused as to why you didn't just figure out a way to travel  together.  But I did like the way that the last after show, before we went on vacation, ended with 
[03:31:30]  a hurrah of you switching the plane ticket.  Yes.  Do you remember that one?  Wait!  Wait!  That was the second switch.  Yeah.  But, I mean, she got there.  We heard about the cruise all show long.  Was Uppy here today?  I don't know, Rowan.  I don't know who...  There was a guy here.  He was sitting here, I think.  Maybe it was a cardboard cutout.  Why does he lie?  He had talked about the phone and he said there's no iPhone.  Why does he trick people?  He said there's no iPhone 5. 
[03:32:00]  He said there is no iPhone 5?  Remember when he said iPhone, he said there's no iPhone.  I was like, what?  What's he talking about?  He just likes to trick people.  And he likes to do two things.  He likes to trick people and he likes to insult the Kardashians.  You and me, we're behind you.  What?  Yeah, that's a little baby Rowan.  He likes to, he likes to trick people, he likes to insult the Kardashians.  I love the Kardashians.  I do too.  I just went there.  Jimmy can't get his picture, unfortunately.  Why?  They were there a little bit late.  They ran in.  I'm sad for Jimmy.  That's not going to be happy tomorrow.  That'll be a good first half hour tomorrow. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Well, Eric, I guess you're clear.  Good thing you ran out of vacation stories because we got something else to go to.  Yeah, no, I felt bad for Jimmy though.  Was he pissed?  I get a little bit.  But the thing is though, they have to host an hour so they ran through it late.  What do they have to host an hour for?  Give them 15 minutes.  Bring them here to the after show.  I tried.  But they're available at 11.  That's a problem.  Well, look, maybe cut them off that show a little early.  What show is it that they're doing an hour for?  Cosmo.  Sam, let's get the wireless and you just walk in there and start doing the interview. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah, well, look, last time you brought that up, Liam off the air started freaking out  as if we were actually going to do that.  We don't even have wireless mics here, Liam.  Nobody's actually going to barge in on people's interviews.  What we got, the new pack, what they do for the other guys, where you put the backpack  camera.  Yeah.  Where you go anywhere you want.  All they need is cell signal.  Or what we can do is we have a lot of those XLR cables from the first day at Sirius where  you went down the hall to the bathroom.  That's true.  We could hook you up that way and you can feel free to wander. 
[03:33:30]  We could just stretch them out.  You know, as much, we heard a lot from you.  We heard a bunch from Eric.  We heard a bunch from Opie.  We heard a lot from Club...  Who's Eric?  Sex Bagel.  Oh, you mean California Boy.  You like his hair?  I am jealous of Luscious Locks.  He does have Luscious Locks now.  And now there's Strawberry Blonde, Roland.  The girls are going to go crazy around here.  You've got to keep that cap off for the rest of the day and let the girls go nuts around  So now he has to wave his hair when the girl goes, excuse me, and let the Prince Valiant 
[03:34:00]  locks blow in the wind.  Yeah, we heard a bunch about Club's Fet of Kenny today.  And he's got a Facebook page if you can find it.  And we did not hear a huge amount about Anthony.  We heard he lost power.  We heard he was doing this.  But you guys missed a compound party.  Yeah, I saw the compound on the video.  The drunk compound where he spilled beer on his controllers.  Yeah, he just fixed everything.  I was looking on Twitter to try to, because I got in late Sunday night, and I was trying 
[03:34:30]  to see any updates from the party.  And all I kept finding was people at the party were just posting photos of Patrice grilling  chicken at the barbecue pit.  But there was nothing else I could find.  He grilled the whole time.  Like Patrice, he grilled, he stayed behind the grill the entire time.  And then he went and watched Reservoir Dogs for a little bit.  But I mean, he was a masterful chef.  If you thought Danny was the grill master, I think we need some kind of pit bosses showdown  between Patrice and Danny.  Because Patrice was the grill master. 
[03:35:00]  He made up some barbecue sauce.  I saw him mixing sauces.  He made wings and burgers and hot dogs and shrimp and everything rolling.  You want to say, fuck you to the MTA and their train schedules.  Fuck you, MTA.  You wanted to get to Long Island for this one.  It was the MTA, it was like, yeah, I had to do like three transfers, because one train  didn't go this way on the weekend.  The other train was down.  Governor Christie.  And you missed Patrice's grilling. 
[03:35:30]  Fuck the MTA.  Grill master number two, Patrice.  Oh, I hate the MTA so much now.  But the thing about it was, I mean, Eric, you talk about getting updates.  Okay, I went to the party.  I stayed.  I didn't leave early.  I just left at whatever.  It was like 11 something.  It wasn't late, but it wasn't.  It was just, some people had already left.  Some people were still there.  So Jess and me left.  And we drove back home.  Got a, went home.  Watched a little TV.  Had a full night's sleep. 
[03:36:00]  Woke up.  And Ant is tweeting from three minutes ago, still at the party.  It's like 9.30 in the morning.  He's a machine.  Like, I don't know how he does it.  And he was partying all weekend.  So it's not like he was resting up for this one.  Because Jim was over at his house the night before.  And this was Sunday night.  This was Sunday going into yesterday.  So yesterday, I guess, is his recovery day.  Because he's drinking all night.  And he stayed up.  And the party was still going after 9 o'clock in the morning. 
[03:36:30]  Somehow, he's able to recover from that, come in here the next day, 6 a.m., and perform a hell of a show.  I don't know how he does it.  And that's what I would like to find out.  I want to see him and Charlie Sheen party together.  I'm sure they could.  I'm sure they could.  I'll bet he would put Charlie Sheen to shame.  I think he would.  Because, I mean, he comes in from 6 a.m., and he's performing.  Who can do that?  You know?  I don't know.  I mean...  I'll go bed at 9.30.  I'm tired.  Yeah, you would be a wreck. 
[03:37:00]  And you're a professional drinker.  Like, you're an animal.  But you couldn't do what he does.  No.  He does, though.  He makes me paranoid, because for some reason, and this was based on another story we heard  today, that Anthony said, I think it was during the first hour.  The replay starts at 3 o'clock.  The opening Anthony replay, of course, Roland.  And Ant said that his iPhone, somebody had hacked his account and used his identity to  not only change his name on his AT&T account, but open up, like, five more family plan iPhones 
[03:37:30]  on his account.  A week ago, Ant was in here telling us the story of a guy who used his name and address  to cash lotto tickets.  Like, what is it about Ant's identity that people keep stealing?  Is that Keith the Cop?  You think Keith the Cop is just selling out?  He's just selling his address to lowlifes?  Or Paul.  Paul.  I don't know.  But, I mean, it makes me paranoid, but it seems to only be happening to Ant. 
[03:38:00]  Has anybody stolen your identity?  My TD Bane twice.  Really?  Yeah.  This happens a lot.  Did you use the AT machines at Times Square or whatever if they had those strips?  Is that what it is?  Happened to me before vacation.  Yeah, me too.  I did a switch on.  Thursday happened to me.  I'd switch a new card on Friday.  Where did it happen?  Eric, it happened to you right before you left?  Yeah, but mine was done online.  Somebody got, I don't know where they got the number, but they were doing it out of Illinois. 
[03:38:30]  Oh my God.  And tried to withdraw some funds from my checking account that I guess the bank has to let it  go through in order for them to prosecute.  Yeah.  But they give the money back to me.  They sign a waiver.  But it's just a big inconvenience because you've got to wait like 10 days for your card.  10 business days for the money to get back to you.  It's horrible.  If you get a temporary card, then they've got to cancel the card that they're sending  you and then reissue another.  It's just all bullshit.  But it seems like for Ant, it's even more than just somebody stealing it. 
[03:39:00]  Like that's twice.  And I'm sure it's happened more times that he hasn't told us about, but just like off  the top of his head, he can think of once when somebody set up a family plan using his  cell phone account and another time when people cashed, what was it, $5,000 in lotto tickets  with his name and address?  Like, why do people do this to Anthony?  He's so much fun.  Well, I think it happened to Fez too, right?  Did it?  Didn't somebody use one of his bank accounts? 
[03:39:30]  You should bring that up there.  Why did you bring that up there?  Oh my God.  I don't know.  But this is, I guess somebody is trying to attack the virus.  Somebody is trying to attack the people who work here on XM 105.  XM 105, Sirius 206, and steal all of our identities.  You know who it is?  Who?  Phone show.  Steve Sterniolo?  Yep.  Why is he doing this?  Because he seems like that kind of dick who would do it.  You just don't like Sterniolo.  Or maybe he may be the next one to attack.  Steve Sterniolo. 
[03:40:00]  Why?  What do you mean?  I don't know.  Because he said they're attacking the virus people.  Attack him.  Leave us alone.  You just don't like him.  But Eric doesn't like him.  Eric, I was laughing.  I said to myself while we were listening to the show today.  How do you know so much about cruises?  You see, you're an authority.  I've been on a lot.  I've been on a lot.  Yeah.  Isn't that, it's a strange thing, Eric.  I've been on a lot.  I guess so.  I've been on, I believe, 19 cruises. 
[03:40:30]  And you're a young man.  19 cruises is like, that's like retirement age.  Yeah.  How many, are you, do you have a goal?  I don't have a, I guess my goal now is to get back to diamond status with Royal Caribbean.  How do you lose diamond status?  Because they change the way that they rank people.  They do it sort of like how the casinos do it now.  Where, if you're at a table or a slot machine, you've got to put your little card in.  And you get points valued at how long you sit at that table. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah.  Or how long you're at that slot machine.  Not that you came there that day.  Uh-huh.  Or that trip.  So, from what I understand, so many old people were doing those three to four day cruises.  And then getting, um, they're ranking up and getting all these expensive perks without actually paying a lot for going on these cruises.  So, now they measure it by time, not by the amount of vacations that you've taken.  So, how much time do you have to spend on a boat to be diamond status?  I've got to figure that out.  I've got to look online.  I heard you get double the points if you're blonde. 
[03:41:30]  Is that what that was, Eric?  Blondes do have more fun.  I dropped down from diamond to platinum.  Eric is sassy.  Roland, how did Troy know that Eric won a bunch of money?  Yeah, how did Troy know?  Oh, no, I didn't, that, that, I didn't say one word.  Where's Troy?  Where's Troy?  No, seriously, that one I didn't say, um, Troy said it for, I said nothing.  Because I showed Roland that photo.  Yeah, I, I kept going.  I didn't say one word.  Yeah, why didn't you share the photos with the social network, Eric?  Like, you, you took all these pictures on the, on the boat.  I was waiting, I was, seriously, I was waiting to, to do it on the show. 
[03:42:00]  Where's the rat?  You could at least Instagram.  You don't, you're the worst at Instagram.  You're so bad.  Hipster nonsense.  Instagram is good.  You're on a, you're terrible at Instagram.  Isn't Eric horrible?  Yeah, he's not good at all.  Like, and he's got all these pictures from his vacation that he could have put on Instagram.  Yeah.  And he didn't put any of them.  So why?  You can crop it into a square and then put some shitty 70s filter on it?  Well, then why are you on?  I haven't been on in a long time.  You just took a picture of Troy.  I saw it.  Because he complained before vacation.  Don't be sassy.  He complained before vacation.  What's up, man?  You haven't used Instagram in a long time. 
[03:42:30]  I go, okay, I took Troy's photo and threw it up there.  Yeah, you suck at Instagram.  Yeah.  So I will bow out of it to you, too.  Troy does have some pictures there.  Well, I'm stepping up my Instagram game over the vacation.  That's something I started doing.  I liked your wrestling one from yesterday.  The collection?  Yeah, because everybody wants to see it.  Exactly.  You've got to be on Instagram to see that shit.  That'll be up on Opie and Anthony Facebook soon.  Or you could be on Facebook to see that shit.  Yeah.  How did you know that E-Rock won all that money in a casino?  Just a rumor.  That's what I said.  It was just a rumor. 
[03:43:00]  Oh, did the other person who saw the photo tell you?  Anything.  Roland didn't say anything.  It wasn't Roland.  Was there another person?  There was Roland and there was Club Soda Kenny.  Who do you think?  Eric, why would you blame Roland?  Who do you think started the rumor?  Well, here's the thing.  I know people...  I've got to say, don't blame Club Soda Kenny.  Yeah, of course blame Club Soda Kenny.  He gossips non-stop.  That wasn't him.  That's all he does.  It wasn't him.  It wasn't him. 
[03:43:30]  No.  Well, then Club Soda Kenny, I hope you'll accept my apology.  I mean, he came on this show out of nowhere today and brought up the dreadlock thing that  Opie tweeted, just bringing the conversation to a halt just for the sake of gossip.  Club Soda Kenny on Facebook.  I guess so.  Who did you hear it from?  Well, Eric was bragging in the control room.  To who?  Yeah, I thought you overheard what he said because he showed right now.  Yeah, he remade no...  He didn't try to hide it at all.  Who was he bragging to?  Kenny.  Oh.  That's such a blonde thing to do. 
[03:44:00]  Oh.  I think this is probably him, the man himself.  You're on the after show.  Yeah, don't blame me for shit.  I backed it up, dude.  You did.  Yeah.  Troy cleared your name and he made it clear that the reason that he found out about this  was because Eric was bragging to you and Troy overheard Eric bragging.  That's correct.  Yeah.  Did you have a good vacation?  I, I, I, like, uh, when I was dialing, like, I, I was off the air so I couldn't hear what 
[03:44:30]  was going on.  Oh, I gotcha, I gotcha.  Did you gamble at all when you were, Kenny, on the cruise ship?  Because you were also on a cruise ship.  I was the only one in my family that lost money.  Of course you were.  Kenny, if you didn't have bad luck, you wouldn't have no luck at all.  I know, but I make friends wherever I go.  You want to hear a cute story?  Yes, I do.  We were gambling and there was this really fat guy sitting next to me. 
[03:45:00]  Yeah, I know.  Eric won a whole bunch of money.  We found out about it.  I'm sorry, Eric.  It was uncalled for.  Way to go.  No, no.  Eric was, is smelt compared to this guy.  Oh, wow.  And this guy, he was killing me with his cigarette smoke.  So anyway, it was just like him and me and my one son at this three-card poker table.  Mm-hmm.  It was in the afternoon and like the fat guy wanted a drink, but like no waitress was like  coming over.  So of course I had to like help my friend get a drink. 
[03:45:30]  So I started yelling at people.  You did.  Get my friend a drink.  And then he looked at me and he goes, do you want a drink?  I go, oh, I don't drink.  That's the entire story.  Well, it doesn't sound like you make friends wherever you go necessarily.  Well, I got him his drink.  I did a good deed.  Sounds kind of like you annoy people.  No, no.  I know.  Some people think I'm a public nuisance. 
[03:46:00]  I don't, Kenny.  As a matter of fact, I was hanging out with Jim a little bit over the vacation and you  were one of the topics of conversation, how much we both enjoy your company.  Why, thank you.  And I must say that I really want you to have dreadlocks.  You knew when you brought that up on the air today that Opie was lying because he lies  so often on his Twitter.  And this is what we were talking about because he's got that video.  Troy, you probably saw the video, the video of the tree falling down that says that he 
[03:46:30]  said he watched the video and realized after he saw that there's a body under the tree.  Now, I looked at that video.  There does appear to be a body under that tree.  It's not a branch.  I think it's a body under the tree.  But he admitted he lied about the horses.  He was lying about my dreadlocks.  And, Kenny, you knew that.  Why would you bring it up?  Well, no, he can't be lying because he Twittered twice about it.  Well, he Twittered like six times about those goddamn dead horses.  And he completely shook my world today when he announced that that was a fabrication. 
[03:47:00]  He had made the whole story up in his head.  Hey, Sam, not to change the subject, but do you want a traffic and weather report?  Kenny, that's why people listen to the radio.  Well, tell people to stay away from the Lincoln Tunnel going out to Jersey because it's fucking  backed up.  I mean, Kenny, we try to do the traffic without profanity.  Yeah, but I'm fucking aggravated now.  Well, I got to go down to the Holland Tunnel.  How's the weather? 
[03:47:30]  It's fucking raining here.  There's like more storms coming.  Now, how's the traffic outside the Lincoln Tunnel, otherwise, in other areas?  I don't know.  Wherever you are, good for you.  I just know where I am.  That's Kenny's traffic report.  Wherever you are, good for you.  Yeah, yeah.  Just, you know, live and be well.  Do you have fun on the scooter?  Peace and love.  Yeah, but you got to drive on the wrong side.  Well, I mean, it's the left side. 
[03:48:00]  To them, it's the right side.  Yeah, but like, I was thinking about this constantly.  Like, how did that thing get started?  Like, where they drive on the other side?  And is it safer or more dangerous than driving on the other side?  It's probably exactly the same because everybody just changes what they're doing.  I don't think it's safer or more dangerous.  I think what is dangerous is that you spend a lot of time thinking about it.  Like, that doesn't make any sense.  While he's driving.  Yeah, that's psychopathic behavior. 
[03:48:30]  I was thinking about that constantly.  Maybe people can Facebook me, clubso2kenny.com.  That's true.  That's not the address.  If you go to clubso2kenny on Facebook, and you'll be able to find it.  Just type in clubso2kenny.  That would be a great discussion to have on the Facebook.  That's like somebody, because clubso2kenny is obviously stuck at the Lincoln Tunnel right now,  as we learned in the traffic report.  But if you're on the internet right now, if you have access to a computer,  please somebody start a thread on clubso2kenny's Facebook page asking, 
[03:49:00]  when did they start driving on the left side of the road,  why did they start it, and do you think it's more dangerous?  I think that's a great topic starter, you know, thought starter.  I think so, too.  Maybe I'll call Comedy by Request also and ask about it.  You know, Kenny, you're welcome to call in.  I'll be guest hosting Comedy by Request from noon to 1 Eastern Time today on Raw Dog. 
[03:49:30]  It's live.  Nice.  If I call in, will you play my DJ breaks?  No, it's Raw Dog.  They wouldn't get it.  People listen to Raw Dog for comedy.  I mean, Ron and Fez will be on at the same time,  so I would suggest, if you're a Ron and Fez fan,  just maybe tune in during the commercials or something.  I don't know.  But, no, nobody would understand the clubso2kenny DJ breaks.  You'd just call in and say,  hey, will you play something by, maybe like, you could request Dice.  And we could talk about your connection to Dice.  We'll play a Dice bit or something like that. 
[03:50:00]  Play a bit from a comedian, not something you did on Opie and Anthony.  It doesn't make sense.  You see, ESPN's doing sunset pictures like Opie.  Kenny has...  I'm stuck in traffic like a fucking slub.  All right.  Well, that doesn't relate at all to what we were just talking about.  Kenny's got to be happy the disco channel's back.  Are you, Kenny?  What channel is that?  I forget what it is.  It's Channel 15, Studio 54.  But I got to tell you,  and I hope the programmers are listening, 
[03:50:30]  the scope used to be a lot better.  Oh, boy.  Well, I mean, you could be a little more constructive.  You think that's what 54 is missing?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Also, they shouldn't call it...  They should put it on Channel 54.  Isn't Shade on a different Channel 2?  No, Shade 45 is 45 still,  and they merged it.  Shade is on the right place, I think.  It was on 66 for a while.  It didn't make any sense, but...  Nah.  Hits 1 is on 2. 
[03:51:00]  Yeah, I mean, there's numbers in channel names.  Who's listening anyway?  What difference does it make?  Just put it on your presets.  Joe Causey is what's missing from the channel, Kenny.  Yeah, he got personality.  Who's on the channel now?  Who the fuck knows?  I don't know.  I believe it's all DJs actually from Studio 54.  Well, that sounds like something that's good to listen to,  like the 80s...  Go ahead.  Talk to old people like the door guy at Studio 54 
[03:51:30]  that, like, wouldn't let people in  unless they were clean-shaven.  Well, that sounds interesting to people  who are fans of the music and fans of the time.  Yeah, live through that, sure.  No, it's not interesting.  All right, well, maybe not to Kenny, but...  Yeah, I guess you'll stick to Hits 1, then.  No, I don't listen to that anymore, either.  Why?  I've been listening a lot lately to  classic Rewind and classic vinyl.  Well, all right, you're getting into some of your rock roots. 
[03:52:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And you know what I really love?  I love Troy Kwan music.  What's Troy Kwan music?  And by the way, somebody Twittered me yesterday  saying,  did you know  Troy's name isn't really  Troy space Kwan?  Why haven't you bashed him for that yet?  So, Troy, consider this a bashing.  Your screen name is not your birth name.  Right.  And on your birth certificate,  I'm sure it says,  not Sam. 
[03:52:30]  That's my full name.  That's Sam as an abbreviation.  Right.  And by the way,  happy birthday, Sam.  Well, it's a bad time you said something.  Well, if I was invited to your party,  I would have said it yesterday.  Well, this is what I was trying to say.  There was no party.  It just,  Opie kind of,  what am I going to say, Opie?  Like, what are you doing here?  And then he starts videotaping me  opening presents  and saying,  I'm going to put this on the internet  and mock you.  It's like,  why would you come to my party then?  Right.  That seems like totally like,  it's just supposed to be  a family get-together.  And then he starts lying about me 
[03:53:00]  on Twitter  and driving everybody nuts,  driving me insane  because I don't know  what's the truth anymore.  I saw the picture you posted  of your doll collection.  Kenny,  that's,  first of all, Eric,  that's not funny  because you have  an action figure collection  in your office.  I understand that,  but it's still funny.  Well, I don't think it is.  I disagree.  And Kenny,  you know that they're action figures.  You're just saying that  to get in my crow.  I didn't see any crows.  I saw dolls.  They're not dolls.  Listen, Kenny, 
[03:53:30]  if we're just here  to occupy you  while you sit in traffic,  I think I'm going to move on.  Wait,  what are you going to talk about next?  Some other than this.  See where the wind takes us.  You know what I mean?  All right.  All right.  I'm going down  to the Holland Tunnel, people.  All right.  So join Kenny  at the Holland Tunnel  right now if you can.  Because he's doing  an appearance there.  All right.  See you tomorrow.  All right.  Bye, Kenny.  Bye.  Always good to hear  from Club Soda Kenny.  That's right.  And to kind of clarify things. 
[03:54:00]  So, Eric,  you were trying to blame  your friend Roland  for giving Troy news  about you winning  a ton of money  at this casino.  I just asked.  I wasn't yelling it  or anything.  I know you didn't yell at him,  but you were accusatory.  And the real truth is  you were being braggadocious  as you tend to be.  And talking to Club Soda Kenny  about your winnings.  And it was just that  Troy heard you bragging.  I was in the room.  He didn't try to hide it at all.  Kenny,  here's how it went down.  Kenny,  we were talking about our cruises. 
[03:54:30]  And Kenny was talking  about gambling.  He said,  did you win anything?  I said,  yes, I did.  And then I showed him the photo.  He won $40,000.  I wish.  I think Eric did very well.  What was the number?  It was enough.  Yeah, exactly.  I saw via hand gestures  what the number was.  I'm not going to reveal Eric's number  if he doesn't want to reveal it.  No.  But I will say this.  If you took  both of our paychecks,  Troy,  Eric would have been 
[03:55:00]  disappointed with that number.  Wow.  Because he walked out of the casino  with a little more.  He just has the fucking luck.  He can't hate him for it.  How does that happen?  There's a story.  I don't know if she wants  to go on the air.  There's a story  that something that happened  in the casino.  If I told you  you wouldn't believe me,  you need to hear it from her.  Your wife?  Yes.  Maybe you talk to her  and see if she wants  to come out tomorrow?  Because we don't have  a lot of time left today.  Or if you tell it.  Wait, somebody else  wants the hotline.  Hang on, I'll be right back.  Somebody else wants the hotline. 
[03:55:30]  He has the fucking luck.  Doesn't he?  Yeah.  I mean, how do you get  the nagle luck?  You can't hate him for it.  You have to be blonde.  No, you know what you have to be.  You have to have  that precious royal seed.  Well, see, that's why  That's for you, Ron.  That's why women  would take the condom  out of the trash can  and roll it up  like a toothpaste roll  and squirt the jizz  back up in her.  Yeah.  I mean, because  It's like, look at the luck  that the nagle's have.  It's the golden boy.  The other thing about 
[03:56:00]  Opie's Twitter  that I wanted to bring up  real quick was  Tell your story  but watch the hotline.  It was that  I can't believe  that people were  giving him shit  for being pissed off  that somebody robbed  his house.  Like, I don't think  you're ever  too, like, people  were Twittering him  saying,  Why are you complaining  about it?  You're a millionaire.  Like, I don't think  you can ever have  too much money  that you can come  back to your house  and see that it's robbed  and be okay.  We gotta call  in the hotline, Troy.  I can't talk to you  about this all day.  Hello, you're on  After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[03:56:30]  Sam.  Yes.  So I just uploaded  the video  from your birthday party.  It's Opie.  And it's clearly a toy.  Yeah, I didn't say  it wasn't a toy.  It's an action figure.  No, it's not  an action figure.  It's a toy.  And you got toys  for your 28th birthday.  Look,  so your video  proves one thing,  that I got  an action figure.  That's what your video shows.  No, I'm uploading  the second one  where it's another toy  you got for your birthday.  So your video proves 
[03:57:00]  I got three action figures.  What's the big deal?  Is it on the YouTube channel?  It's up on the,  it's on Opie Radio  on Twitter  and it's on his YouTube channel  and it's on Opie and Anthony Facebook.  I don't understand why.  And when I was over  your mom's house,  Bobby,  the lovely Bobby.  Hitting on her a little bit.  With the handlebar mustache  took me on a tour  of your childhood home.  Yeah.  Not because he,  he wanted to kind of,  you know,  show me where  young Sam lived.  He wanted to show me  how his house 
[03:57:30]  has been completely  taken over by  Sam's toys.  Well, yeah,  my dad's always very helpful  in that respect.  I,  you're taking over  the family room  with your toys.  I think you tweeted,  did you tweet that picture  or was that picture  from your house?  No, no, no.  That picture was from my house.  My apartment.  Your house,  not your parents' house.  My apartment.  Okay, so they,  he showed me a shelf  in what used to be  the family room  that had to have  five to six hundred  toys.  That shelf  is in a room  that used to be 
[03:58:00]  the toy room  that my dad  turned into his office.  So that's where  they belong  as far as I'm concerned.  And...  And then we went  into the laundry room  where there was  a huge bin  filled with Sam's toys.  Well, we don't throw in...  That's a lot of toys.  And, and good old,  uh, Jerry,  Sam's father goes,  you haven't seen  nothing yet.  We went upstairs,  the hallway closet  completely filled with,  you guessed it,  Sam's toys.  I have a lot of stuff.  But we don't...  We went into your room,  which by the way  looks like you still  live there, 
[03:58:30]  which is kind of creepy.  Well, that's...  Out of the house  for what,  five, six years now?  That's for you  and my mom  to talk about.  It's really,  really creepy.  It's one of those rooms  where I would swear  that a kid still lived there.  A kid, not Sam,  who's now 28 years old.  Then Jerry brought me  into the walk-in closet  that I guess you  and your mom,  uh, him,  him and his, uh,  wife used,  completely filled  with Sam's toys.  Well, I don't know  what they did,  but we don't throw  things out in my family.  We just don't.  We're like...  No, no, Jerry said  Sam doesn't throw 
[03:59:00]  anything out.  I'm starting to get  the idea that you  might be a hoarder.  I don't throw  anything out,  but my mom  doesn't throw  anything out either.  My mom's got  little pants  that I wore  when I was three  and homework  that I did  in second grade.  Like...  I'm starting to hear  that you want  the stuff saved,  not your parents.  I want...  I don't like  throwing things out  and my mom  doesn't like  throwing things out.  She passed  that trait  on to me.  And why is it  I wasn't allowed  to film  in the Sam  household?  Because it's  a private  establishment.  I wasn't allowed  to film  in the childhood 
[03:59:30]  home of young  Sam Roberts.  Because of the same  reason I can't go  to your mom's house  and make videos  and, you know,  and you invite me  to a nice,  intimate family  gathering  and I make  YouTube videos  mocking you.  You see  when you put it  in that  phraseology?  Alright,  you just put  the challenge  out there.  I will walk  through my  childhood home  with a video  camera.  If I'm allowed  to walk  through your  childhood home  with a video  camera.  No, I won't  do that because  you've already  made it clear  that your mom  used to throw  your stuff out 
[04:00:00]  while you were  still using it.  So she definitely...  Oh, well,  and you stand up  in the driveway  if I left  my shoes out.  That is true.  Yeah, I mean,  it's...  Because,  you know,  your mom  didn't save  things to the  degree my mom  did doesn't  mean that my  mom's a bad  person or that  I'm a bad  person.  And also,  Sam,  in the videos  I'm uploading,  you can clearly  see the dreadlocks  that you had  yesterday,  but for some  reason,  today,  they're magically  gone.  I don't have  dreadlocks and  they wouldn't  be magically  gone if I  did.  You can clearly 
[04:00:30]  see the dreadlocks  in the video  I just posted.  Clearly.  Well, check the  video for yourself,  OP Radio on  Twitter and YouTube,  the usual places.  And I don't  know if the guy's  dead under the  tree, but that  is the guy  under the tree.  I do know the  horse was a  fake.  It looks like a  guy.  Every once in a  while, I'll  fuck with people  on Twitter.  Every once in a  while.  So I will admit  the horse was  not dead, but  the other stuff,  I don't know.  I don't know what  the hell's going  on there.  Well, this is  going to start a  great birthday  afternoon.  The first feedback  is in.  Sam, just saw  your birthday  video.  You are very,  very gay. 
[04:01:00]  So, great.  This is going to  be a great  birthday for Sam  Roberts.  I would talk to  you all day,  but we're about  to cut into  Ron and Fez  time.  Oh, and I  got Ronnie with  the dead horse.  I know I did.  You did.  We talked about  it.  I know I finally  got him.  Well, hopefully  they'll bring it  up today.  I appreciate the  call.  I don't appreciate  the video  whatsoever.  Well, we will  be going through  your house with  a video camera,  and Bobby will  give us a proper  tour, and I will  film the whole  thing.  Can we get  Dr. Robin to  go through it? 
[04:01:30]  You have toys  all over your  parents' house.  Well, I don't  put them there.  I don't live there  anymore.  Yeah, but they  don't want them  there anymore.  Yes, they do.  Hopefully your  dad told me you  can ship them  all over to  your apartment  for a wedding  gift.  He'll never do  it.  My mom won't  let him.  I'm not even  joking.  It would fill up  a small U-Haul.  Easily.  I would need a  storage unit for  them.  Easily.  I mean, easily.  Listen, Opie, we  got to talk about  this tomorrow.  Happy birthday,  Sam.  Thank you so  much.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  And Sam, I  apologize. 
[04:02:00]  Your birthday  guest couldn't  call in to  celebrate your  special day.  This whole  thing, like this  whole celebration,  I thought the  after show was  going to be a  celebration of all  things Sam Roberts.  Uh-huh.  You guys really  shit the bed on  this one.  Well, I tried.  We'll try for  another day.  How about  tomorrow?  We'll see what  his schedule is  like.  He's a very  busy, important  person.  So far, the  bed has been  shit all over.  You got the  celebration I got  for my birthday.  Exactly.  And who am I?  Troy Kwan?  I'm Sam Roberts,  goddammit. 
[04:02:30]  Ron and Fez are  coming up next.  My birthday  will have guests.  Your birthday?  Okay, great.  I'll have to stick  around for that  because that'll be  cool to see.  Sam, the text  says, sorry, happy  birthday.  Woo, woo, woo.  You know it.  Woo, woo, woo.  Violin J.  Can I call him?  Either way, I'm  very happy.  That's very exciting,  Eric.  We'll see you tomorrow  with more after  Opie and Anthony  live.  Raw dog at noon.  Go.  The Opie and  Anthony show is  now over.  For real this time.  Check out the ONA  show on Facebook  at facebook.com  slash Opie and  Anthony. 
[04:03:00]  And catch Opie and  Anthony live Monday  through Friday from  6 to 10 a.m.  Eastern.  Ron and Fez are  next.  Hey.  On the virus. </pre>
