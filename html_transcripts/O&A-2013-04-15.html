<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with discussions of tax season anxieties, the annoyance of junk mail, and a viewer’s report of a Tiger Woods golf rule violation and NBC’s artificial bird sounds during golf broadcasts.  This led to a lengthy, profane discussion about Lindsey Lohan and her father, Michael, fueled by Jim Norton’s previous harsh comments about Lohan and Michael's subsequent angry tweets.  The hosts also criticized the MTV Movie Awards, specifically targeting Rebel Wilson’s performances and Adam Sandler’s appearance, alongside a humorous anecdote from Jim Norton about mistaking a mooring ball for a submarine.  The segment concluded with a bizarre, crude calculation involving the number of foreskins needed to circle the equator.

The next segment picked up this bizarre thread before launching into a profane, fictional interview with a Mafia hitman named Lyle Chipperson.  This was followed by a promotional bit for a fictional album by "Tippy Tom Regurgitated," a parody of Tom Jones.  The hosts then played Johnny Cash's "Ring of Fire" with comedic interjections, further criticizing the MTV Movie Awards, especially Rebel Wilson's koala bear skit.  They satirically analyzed Ritz Crackers' social media strategy and a Kmart commercial, “ship my pants,” before engaging in a lengthy, highly profane debate about the Trayvon Martin shooting and the George Zimmerman trial, examining the events leading to the shooting, Zimmerman's actions, racial profiling, and the media's portrayal.

The following segment continued the discussion of the George Zimmerman trial, debating his culpability and actions, including the role of the 911 dispatcher.  The hosts briefly mentioned Jamie Foxx's Trayvon Martin support shirt and Justin Bieber's insensitive Anne Frank guest book message, followed by a discussion of Kevin Hart’s DUI arrest and resisting arrest.  The segment concluded with a critique of a blog post criticizing a Louis C.K. joke about pedophiles and fountains, playing a clip of the joke.

The next segment began with a discussion sparked by a false news story about Tony Randall fathering twins posthumously. This led into a discussion about a hot teacher arrested for having sex with underage students, followed by a humorous discussion about one host’s disciplinary struggles with his violent young child and the effectiveness of timeouts. Dr. Steve, a recurring guest, joined the show to discuss frozen sperm, cryopreservation, and the hosts' personal health concerns.  Comedian Chris Stefano joined later, discussing his career and distinctive haircut.  A caller from Ireland added to the eclectic mix.

The final segment featured an advertisement for Steven Singer's gold-dipped roses, with a website and phone number designed to express disdain for Steven Singer.  A caller, Yoshi, won a Sudoku puzzle, and comedian Chris D. Stefano promoted his upcoming performances.  The hosts concluded the show by briefly mentioning their earlier, lengthy discussion about the Trayvon Martin case.  Jim Norton was present in studio for most of the show, and Dr. Steve and Chris Stefano appeared as guests later in the broadcast.

[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, this is perfect.  This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me!  I work here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on?  Life?  No, is it happening?  This is it?  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony Show, a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment and having very few limits.  I like where this is going.  I like where this is going.  I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is like different than any other radio.  Don't tell them what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's just not like radio. 
[00:04:00]  It's just like hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why.  This is American freedom of speech.  It's good on every level.  And sand.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people.  Real excitement.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:04:30]  Morning.  Wake the fuck up.  Wakey, wakey.  Wakey, wakey, angel cakey.  Wakey, wakey.  Oh, boy.  Mom, mom, mom, mom.  Monday, huh?  Tax day, huh?  All right.  This is a fitting.  I don't know.  We got an extension or something?  Yeah, we always get those extensions filed and then we got to come up with everything before the end of the summer. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, I have no idea.  I don't either.  Who the fuck knows?  I just get a bunch of stuff.  I sign it.  I send it out.  That's it.  I got my last W-2 form like a couple days ago.  Yeah.  I hope it doesn't fuck up everything.  It's like for $193 or something.  So I'm in a panic that that's going to throw off everything.  Nah. 
[00:05:30]  We got like, I don't know.  We get W-2s from all over the fucking ball field.  Yeah.  Couple here, couple there.  Nah, you got plenty of time to send it in to old Harvey.  Harvey!  Before he files anything.  I got to send everything.  I haven't sent one thing to him yet.  Really?  Yeah.  No W-2s.  No W-2s.  No deductions.  No nothing.  I checked my mail for the first time in a month yesterday.  Oh yeah?  Yeah.  How was that?  Oh, it's such a treat. 
[00:06:00]  You just fall out of the mailbox?  It was so packed, the post guy has to be fucking livid.  Yeah.  Living in a building, New York City, they give you just a tiny little fucking mailbox.  Oh yeah.  So every time I go in a store and they go, uh, can we have your address?  I go, no!  Yeah, never give it.  And they go, it's for nothing.  I'm like, no, you're lying.  That means I'm going to get some dumb fucking pamphlet, circular magazine.  Yeah.  And my mailbox official can't handle it. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  And then they go, well, we don't know how to ring you up.  I'm like, well, then I know I'm leaving right now.  And then the next thing you know, they figure out how to ring you up.  How is it that they can't ring you up unless you give them personal information?  That's bullshit.  No, I know.  I sit there and go, really?  You can't ring me up?  Ring it up or I'll leave.  Watch them ring it up.  You're willing to have me walk over $12?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Make a big stand over $12.  And then they get pissed. 
[00:07:00]  When they go, your phone number?  I go, no.  They get so mad.  I'm like, I don't know you.  Why would I give you my phone number?  I don't give anyone my phone number.  You know, I gave a woman my number.  I thought of all of this the other day, but she was so nice.  Oh, they got you.  And they tried to locate me in their records at first because I asked her what kind of  product I brought last time I was in.  It was for this face cream I use.  Well, it's working.  Oh, come on, guys.  But I said, I don't know what I have. 
[00:07:30]  And she's like, let's check the system.  And she couldn't find me.  So after the purchase, she goes, well, if you give me your number, I can put you in  the system.  And then we have a record.  And I was like, I kind of felt like.  God, they got you.  Yeah.  And I didn't mind because I felt like I asked her to do something.  So have fun with all the junk mail.  What's my old number?  It's my old number.  It's not the new one.  It's not the new fancy mail.  Oh, wow.  I didn't check my, like I said, my mail for at least a month.  And half of it was junk.  Half of it.  It really is crazy. 
[00:08:00]  I take the huge pile and then right away, and half of it turns out to be junk.  Throw that away.  And then I could start digging into what I got to do with my mail.  Yeah.  And I don't check my mail because I've said it.  There's nothing fun that comes in the mail anymore.  No, it's either going to cost you money or it's junk.  Yeah.  That's it.  Yeah.  What's a listing of how much the apartment below you just got sold for or above you?  Yeah, but they never say what the price was.  You got to go to the post office and say you're off mail.  I don't want any more mail.  What do you mean?  Just say stop mail. 
[00:08:30]  And then what happens?  We're blind to their tyranny.  Jerry.  How long would it?  We have a bucket on your head.  Wait a minute.  How long would it?  That would be a great reality show.  Oh, yeah.  You'd have to have the balls to do it, but you just get rid of your mailbox.  And refuse to fucking check your mail.  That's right.  No.  You want to see a Sims game.  Yeah.  How long would it take before you have no cable, no phone, no electricity, no house?  Oh, without any internet stuff either. 
[00:09:00]  You just don't do anything.  If you stopped right now paying bills, how long would it take for you to be homeless?  This is like a, this is an idea for a movie.  It could take a...  How long though?  I'd say...  With foreclosure, you could absolutely stay in your house.  Yeah, and then they always give you that fucking grace period with bills, one month, and then  you get the thing that says, hey, you're late, and then they give you a warning.  How long for the electricity to go out?  That's the biggie.  I think three months. 
[00:09:30]  Three months for electricity.  Yeah.  The cable company, I mean the phone companies, they're motherfuckers now.  If you're two days over, they turn off your phone.  I know that because that happened to me.  Whoa.  Because one of the bills slipped through the cracks.  Next thing you know, they turn off my phone two days past the bill being due.  Man.  So I know you would lose your phone within a month.  That's obvious.  Yeah.  What about cable?  Cable is about two or three months too, right?  Yeah, cable is another one of those.  I think three months is pretty much the, you know, we'll give you this, and then they're 
[00:10:00]  really yelling, though, after three months, getting those notices that no one ever gets,  the red writing on them.  Right, right.  Oh, wow.  And then foreclosure would take at least a year to two years, so now you're in a house  that's shitty because you don't have electricity, cable, or phone.  Yeah, yeah.  And then how long before they just throw you in jail, like enough already?  If you don't pay, you go to jail.  Well, because then eventually it leads into not paying your taxes because you're not checking  your mail.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:10:30]  I want this broken down.  How long?  It all depends on how long the foreclosure is, but...  Foreclosure, I know from personal experience, that could be a while.  And even the tax stuff could take a long time.  Really?  For them to get to you.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It'll be a few years.  And then you wander into the woods, then they have to find you.  Yeah, you're fucked any way around it.  Yeah.  Any way around it.  Totally screwed. 
[00:11:00]  Anyone watch the Masters?  Well, I saw one of them last night, Jim Norton.  Oh, wow!  God damn it!  Woo!  I just wanted to see if Tiger Woods would kick the ball any further.  I love it.  It's cheating.  Winter rules, you know.  Well, that rule that he got caught on some fucking douchebag from home.  What?  Oh, you don't know what happened? 
[00:11:30]  I heard what happened.  They were more or less going to...  There was a couple things that happened.  They were more or less going to let it slide, because they weren't aware of what he did.  But some asshole from home, you want to talk about a prick, actually called up and said that he broke the rule.  Ugh.  Who does that?  And then they looked at the tape, and it was kind of a gray area.  They could have went either way with it.  But then Tiger, like, kind of implemented himself in a press conference, saying that he moved the ball back two yards. 
[00:12:00]  Because he's supposed to drop it.  He chose to drop it from where, you know, he hit the initial shot.  So you have to drop it as close as possible to where your ball was originally.  And he admitted in the press conference that he moved a little bit back.  Because to those guys, you know, it's fine-tuning.  Yeah.  So he knew if he moved back, like, two yards, I think he said two yards, that would make all the difference in the world on that particular shot of his.  But it was a douchebag from home. 
[00:12:30]  That's ridiculous.  That fucking picked up his phone.  And, you know, of course it was one of the, hey, type of guys.  Tiger got caught by one of those guys.  You know, I'm watching.  So what's going to happen to him?  Nothing happened.  I mean, then there was controversy that, you know, he handed in the wrong scorecard.  And when you do that, you're usually DQ'd, disqualified.  But for whatever reason, that's when I started fucking falling asleep, you know, about a half hour into the explanation with Jim Nance. 
[00:13:00]  They turned it into the Tiger Woods tournament.  Even though he was, like, you know, sort of in it the whole time.  Oh, so once you sign your card, if the score is incorrect.  Then you're DQ'd.  You're disqualified.  Even though it was a legitimate mistake, yeah.  So they only gave him, what, the two-stroke penalty.  Right.  But the whole thing is he hit pretty much a perfect golf shot.  Did you see any of this?  None.  I know you're not a big golf guy.  Tiger Woods hits this shot. 
[00:13:30]  It hits the pin.  It's a perfect golf shot.  Right.  Hits the pin and goes in the fucking water.  Jesus.  So instead of taking a three or four on the hole, he ends up in the end taking an eight or nine.  Because it goes in the water.  Then he plays that ball.  And then he gets a two-stroke penalty on top of that because he fucked up his drop.  It was like a five.  It was, I think, Travis can help me out here.  It was like a five-stroke turnaround.  How does the drop work?  Well, that's where it gets complicated because I think there were three options. 
[00:14:00]  There's a drop zone, I believe.  Then there's where you could, the entry into the water.  Then you could, like, move back from there.  You know what I mean?  Oh, my God.  Keeping where the ball ended up in the water and the pin in line.  And then you can go back as far as you want.  Or you could redo the shot.  But if you redo the shot, you've got to drop the ball pretty much exactly or very close to exactly from where it was originally.  And he chose that option, but then he moved it back a couple yards. 
[00:14:30]  So if it goes in the water, you can just redo it?  Yeah, but you've got to stroke penalty and all that.  Oh, you do?  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  It's a fucking major fucking bummer.  Yeah, I know about that.  I know about the water stuff.  Yeah.  I can't avoid the water.  It's impossible.  But the point here is that some asshole from home called.  Wow.  And started this whole thing.  But how did nobody know that?  Like, don't they have people watching?  It was close.  It really was fucking close.  And I guess it's a new rule.  I don't know.  It was very complicated. 
[00:15:00]  I mean, because Tiger knows the rules of golf.  So he had a fucking brain fart.  He wasn't trying to cheat in front of everyone because, you know, obviously that would be impossible.  If we're playing golf on the golf course, we could use an old foot wedge or something and no one's going to notice.  Yeah, yeah.  But when you've got millions of people watching at home and you've got all those spectators, you're not going to cheat in front of everybody ever.  Oh, you don't think it was an intentional thing?  No, no.  I don't think so.  No, not at all.  Why are all these douchebags golfers going, you want to step aside here and play by the wolf of golf? 
[00:15:30]  That just sticks in the mud.  That's what reminds me of Brian Regan.  I distinctly heard the red-breasted whippoorwill.  That was another one of those guys.  This is a real story.  They were piping in bird noises during the game.  So when, you know, a guy's lining up a putt and it gets very quiet and you hear like...  In the background, they were literally piping it in.  Were they really...  Fake bird noises.  For the broadcast, just to make it even more special.  And some guy called up because he knew that the sound of one of the birds was not indigenous to the area that the fucking game was being played. 
[00:16:00]  Where the tournament was being held.  It was like, oh, I distinctly heard.  You got that bit?  Regan does a good bit on that one.  Yeah, it's two and a half.  Oh, yeah, play it really fast.  It's worth playing here.  I like watching golf on TV.  And I read recently, this is true, NBC Sports, on their golf telecast, they got caught putting in bird noises for ambiance.  Birds aren't even there.  And a bird lover called him on it because he was hearing a bird that was not indigenous to where the tournament was being held. 
[00:16:30]  Wow.  Can you imagine being the guy who had to field that phone call?  Uh, yeah, sports department.  Uh, yeah, hi.  Listen, uh, does this sound right to you?  No, that don't. 
[00:17:00]  Um, I don't know what you're talking about.  Yeah, yeah, apparently you don't.  Yeah, I guess I'm supposed to believe the blue-breasted whippoorwillow has decided to alter its annual migratory route to enjoy a little golf.  What?  What?  Maybe for that rig and you should try.  O-o-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh. 
[00:17:30]  O-o-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.  Okay.  I get it I got one you have to admire that guy you have to admire you're not  gonna slip a chirp past him what the hell was that please tell me I did not 
[00:18:00]  just hear that please please tell me this is not happening to me today I wish he  would have handled it differently I wish instead of Colin he would have snuck in  there late at night pulled out that bird tape you know stuck in another animal  track no one would even know till it's going out live Ernie Els is looking at  about a 10-foot putt here this is this is a downhill putt it's gonna break a 
[00:18:30]  little bit to his left  I would have said put pigeons in there that could work too chipper thanks but how do you get a hold of 
[00:19:00]  the uh the network from home I like who do you call and you and that created but you're gonna call  someone they're not gonna be there so now you have to get them on the phone and go I was watching and  obviously and tiger you know who doesn't just hang up on the rule there we'll just go yeah yeah we'll  look into exactly I don't know yeah what do you call like do you call the the television station  do you call the golf course probably call the golf course but I mean seriously yeah someone's ready 
[00:19:30]  to take your phone call right I don't know it was a pretty good tournament but tiger just got fucked in  the end because it really was I mean you're taught to aim for the pin yeah and he hit the pin dead  center and that knocks the ball backwards into the water what a horrendous break I've seen those guys  hit the pin and it just stops dead and falls right yeah yeah I mean it you know it does hit the pin 
[00:20:00]  from time to time but he just got an unlucky fucking bounce off it and that was like I don't know in  the end it was like a four or five stroke turnaround who wound up uh winning uh Adam Scott first  Australian that's why that's a big deal even Greg Norman never won the masters good old uh the shark  there never won the shark so Greg Greg Norman and uh Australia I'm very very happy today  and uh what's important here is that Steve Williams is Adam Scott's caddy and Steve Williams was Tiger 
[00:20:30]  Woods's caddy for a while a lot of his wins over the years and they had a major fucking falling out  right right major falling out because I think because Steve Williams wife basically said to him  did you know about what was going on with Tiger ew I don't know it's my guess oh imagine that did  you know you travel with him yeah you know how much fucking money I'm being paid shut the fuck up so  the caddy and him are on the outs way on the outs they haven't uh yeah they haven't been a team in 
[00:21:00]  a couple years now I guess you think he was his dumb wife in his ear I don't know I think Steve  Williams felt like he was blindsided by the whole thing he had no idea what kind of guy cares right  what kind of fucking you think I don't care if one of you was bad honestly I wouldn't you give a  fuck it's a shit I don't know though I don't know the full story there I don't want to fucking speak  out of turn maybe there's something else to it because what kind of fucking guy I don't want to  tell tales out of school yeah because Steve Williams rubs it in now like see what I've been you know  now he's got a major under his belt without Tiger Woods you know what I gotta piss off Steve uh Tiger a 
[00:21:30]  little bit you imagine one of your guy friends is banging a lot of girls and you get upset like hey what are you  doing bub no I don't care if you're fucking small goats and then killing them  you ask who ratted out Tiger Woods I heard about this but I don't I didn't bring it to the discussion  because is it really true come on Matt in Jersey go ahead Matt hey Oney yeah I read a tweet on Yahoo  that uh Lindsey Vonn's ex-husband called the Masters and he tweeted uh no problem Masters 
[00:22:00]  helping out called in uh I gotta watch those cheaters or something like that maybe he's trying  to get a little uh a little heat yeah maybe he's trying to get a little heat from the whole thing  or joking yeah that would be pretty ironic though it would be Lindsey Vonn is now dating Tiger Woods  so some are saying it was Lindsey Vonn's ex that called but maybe he's just fooling around with it  having fun with the whole thing I don't know all right guys I'm out thanks Matt I don't know if  that's been proven has it well that's kind of a fucking like what happened in the movies 
[00:22:30]  wouldn't happen in real life that would be something in the movies yeah I think he's I think  he just took advantage of the situation to have to burn Tiger a little bit I love when that happens  huh I love when that happens the father gets a ball for his son or for a kid and he gives him  gives him the ball and then the dad looks away for a couple seconds and the kid throws it 
[00:23:00]  that's adorable that kid don't know he's playing ball  he hands him the ball and the father turns to the side to talk to another guy real quick  and the little kid just heaves the ball back on the field wait did the guy give the father and  the kid the ball or the father gave him the ball a guy gave the father the ball to give to the kid  oh that's nice so yeah so he hands it to the kid he throws it back well it's come down to this if  you go to a sporting event and you catch something and you don't have a kid next to you you're fucked 
[00:23:30]  you always have to hand it off you gotta give it to kids now the place will boo the shit out of you  no way fuck off every I'm telling you but there was that classic one recently where the guy caught  the ball with his with his chick yeah and everyone and there's a kid right there pretty much crying if  you can find the clip we we played this on our show a little while back and he refused to give it to  the little kid oh he got hammered yeah oh the crowd just hammered the guy you wouldn't you wouldn't  give it to a kid jimmy no i would not and i would hold it over my head and i would i would just cheer

[00:29:30]  saying fuck her why did she get all these fucking chances the amount of the amount of chances she's  gotten and the way she's acted like such a brat and so ungrateful you know she's gonna wind up if  she doesn't stop driving into a pole or killing somebody right and it's like you're mad at me because  i said cunt like that's the problem right how about you get mad at these tabloid websites which are the  ones who are really wrecking right what's going on with your daughter and you keep talking to them 
[00:30:00]  right oh yeah this guy continues to talk to the vultures who have been hounding his daughter he  continues to communicate with them and answer their questions and like one of them asked do you think  she'll do well in rehab but i think he said he doesn't think she'll do well or something because  because it's a sick family in general they're all trying to be famous oh michael lohan is putting his  own fame above trying to be a good parent that's been obvious for many many years when lindsay lohan 
[00:30:30]  was still a young girl this guy was trying to become famous too it's awful i gotta teach him some manners  shut the fuck up it's just laughable it's like why don't you worry about the websites that are making  their livings taking pictures up your daughter's skirt or capitalizing on every dumb thing she does in a  club with a photo right how about you get mad at them instead of answering their questions and  giving them quotes and getting your face on their websites yeah here it is lindsay lohan called vulgar 
[00:31:00]  names on radio show her father rips the crude host lindsay lohan definitely has some haters but  when a radio show host calls her vulgar words her father michael lohan we probably should have  had this printed out today this is a big deal we don't uh vulgar words her father michael lohan isn't  going to take that lightly i wish you could make the font a little bigger i'm leaning as far over as  possible uh comedian jim norton co-host on the opian anthony show on serious radio this week 
[00:31:30]  and while i can't read this fucking thing it says uh comedian jim norton a co-host on the opian anthony  show on serious radio this week and while discussing lindsay's appearance on david letterman's show  he let loose with a string of expletives to describe the troubled actress quote she's never  taken it seriously she's gotten so many fucking chances jim said about lindsay returning to rehab  for her court-ordered 90-day stint then he really ripped into lindsay's recent actions 
[00:32:00]  saying that she was just acting like a fucking dumb cunt  norton continued to talk about the incident uh where she cut up her borrowed dress that she wore  to a party you have a job like that you run around like a twat they give you a nice dress to wear and  you cut it up like a spoiled cunt oh he also took another shot at lindsay's actions now that she's in  her late 20s at a certain age you have to stop acting like a douche 
[00:32:30]  norton didn't keep his comments just to lindsay he also ripped into michael lohan placing the blame  with him quote her family is shitty and i want to hate her but you look at her family and her father  is just fucking shit just shit yeah i'm the problem though right a comic on a radio show says that like  i'm the issue right not the fact that these websites have been fucking they have been 
[00:33:00]  plastering your daughter's face and at every part of her body and and everything she does  they plaster up there and he can't get uh an interview with them quick enough you can't get  an interview with them quick enough but i say the fucking c-word and you're offended it's fucking  laughable so it's laughable and then they got him right yeah it says papa lohan leapt to his  daughter's defense and slammed the lewd comments exclusively to radaronline.com  exclusivity oh no wow and that quote makes me think that he reached out to them of course and 
[00:33:30]  said hey you hear about this radio show i actually okay i think they reached out to him you think so  i do yeah i'm thinking they did uh quote from him they have some nerves saying such things about my  daughter which i know they would never say to her face and especially not mine when she was at the  top of her career they all praised her nope now because she's having issues they slam her god damn  them see that that to me sounds like he doesn't mean us jim and opie and anthony he means them as in 
[00:34:00]  the collective they all praised her meaning like those type of guys but it's a dad i guess i understand  why he would be mad i can't be mad at the father for being mad but it's like dude fucking worry about  your own there was a tape recording of lindsey crying talking to her mother remember that phone call  to her father right how did i hear that i wasn't in the car who recorded that and released it so i  could hear it thus then why you said shitty family how what piece of that's a shitty family because 
[00:34:30]  none of us should have known about that none of us should have heard that yeah who recorded that  wasn't me right i'm not the one who fucking betrayed someone's private phone conversation  the father the mother i don't know someone in that family that's also looking for fame someone in  that family who's looking for fame or looking for money or whatever it is they're looking for  i think is really shitty and i never should have heard that that really made me hate her family  i don't give a fuck what the motives were well they were to let people see what lindsey's plight 
[00:35:00]  that's not for the public to see right when a website if my father if a website said to my father  how would you feel jim is going to do about being sober he would never say well i don't think he's  going to do well who the fuck says that who answers a gossip site's question like that yeah  embarrassing continue uh the article's almost done he he says this is lindsey lohan's dad these men's  comments are absolutely disgusting and someone should teach them respect i'd be happy to oh again 
[00:35:30]  teach you the meaning of word respect he's the father i get it i i tweeted something nasty and i  actually took it down um oh did you yeah i said you could teach me respect just don't teach me how  to raise a kid but that was good it was it was but it was like uh you know it's like that it's your  kid it's i get you i kind of understand why he's you know and he finished by saying michael has been  an outspoken advocate of getting lindsey's into treatment this website that's a there's so many 
[00:36:00]  grammatical issues in this article yeah like i guess they're reporters right uh michael has been an outspoken  advocate of getting lindsey into treatment for her addiction issues and calls the guys out for their  own actions who are they to knock lindsey when they do the same things she does but they don't have  the notoriety that lindsey does i'll i'll fucking sue the cunt i've never fucking partied like lindsey  lohan you douche till it's 1999 you can't just throw that shit out there prove that i've partied 
[00:36:30]  anywhere near your daughter has oh i have oh you've done worse no i haven't done any of the  fucking you know none of us have haven't uh popped the molly who a fucking piece of  shit just throwing that out there i pride myself on the fact that i don't party like that you twat  well you know he's just he's the daddy's obsessed whatever i don't that doesn't bother daddy yeah  daddy doesn't like hearing his little girl getting it bothers me as an individual i don't fucking party 
[00:37:00]  like that never have that's embarrassing she's an embarrassment she is a bit of an embarrassment  and when i i don't even it's not even the party that gets me because as a recovering addict i don't  the partying i get it's the attitude of it and the and the fucking stick in the middle finger up in  court or or you know didn't she steal jewelry or was that solved did she not steal it did she steal  it but there's always a problem with her yeah yeah it's like quit acting like a douche so i have a 
[00:37:30]  fucking easy job but we have we just sorry man what we do is easy this is not brain surgery if you're  running around and you can't control yourself and you can't stop fucking getting into problems and  trouble just cut the shit right we're just reacting to what we see out there this was all based on the  letterman appearance where letterman was kind of making her cry yeah because you could see  letterman has had it with her shit too but he's he's a nicer guy than you know most i would love  to see her get sober i've always heard people to get sober i always want to see people get sober 
[00:38:00]  well so then i'm minding my own fucking business friday and he writes me he goes op radio your buddy  norton needs to man up and not be a coward let him talk to my face about lindsey lohan i'll rip his tongue  out and then i just wrote him back i go are you actually trying to start heat over your  daughter's pathetic situation so sad get her in rehab now the uh and then i wrote looks like  someone should have worried less about being famous to do some better parenting face and then he wrote  me back sorry i'm almost done uh he writes like to get scrappy with both of you obviously you don't 
[00:38:30]  have respect either blocked and then i wrote all blocked really i go instead of blocking me you should  try blocking all the bad influences from getting into your daughter's house he's just end of twitter  fucking battle it's it's amazing that and again i guess being a dad you're you're going to be  defensive you i can't knock that of course you're going to some some guy you don't know calls her a  cunt of course you're going to step up and go i'll rip his tongue i mean you know you have to be a  dummy to not step up for her but it the irritating part is this is if this was a guy who didn't talk to 
[00:39:00]  these websites and didn't participate like this i'd have a lot more respect for him but the fact  that he's involved with this shit yeah and i'm sure you do want your daughter to get sober i'm sure  you do but that's not an excuse to tape record her if he did and release that whoever whoever released  that recording of her crying and thinks they're doing a service yeah and thinks that they are well  we're showing people with lindsey how bad it is no i think that person is deluding themselves as to 
[00:39:30]  their motives but i don't even think it's that my my humble opinion they're looking for their own  little little bump a little bump of fame every bit of notoriety he's gotten has been on the back  of his daughter so no one knows who the fuck he is without the daughter you know and he's done reality  shows and shit like that based on on nothing but hurt right yeah he's done like even if he doesn't  like what you guys said you don't think there's a large part of him that would love to do like a  celebrity boxing match or something with you of course and that's why he's being public about 
[00:40:00]  it always like that feels out that's what he's looking for and the comments i mean she's a very  well-known person she's had a you know uh she's popular her career is big the the comments were 90  smashing him and smashing her that's not because they were my fans it is because people are so sick  sick of her doing this shit and hearing about it you get sick of it i'll say this for paris hilton 
[00:40:30]  after that last bust whatever she did she really shut the fuck up and stopped she stopped i think  that scared her about anything she turned her life around a little bit so it seems because she was kind  of yeah in the tabloids all the time for nonsense you just get tired of little babyish celebrities  getting away with everything and it's like how many times are you going to get  uh either either you know was she driving under the influence wasn't she how many people have this  many questions raised about them it's very it's very confusing because the irish person does that 
[00:41:00]  there's no way they're getting all those chances no never so you wonder why she has such an influence  over these judges and lawyers and everyone in between yeah why have i never been accused of cutting up  clothing that somebody gave to me for a fucking event like a little brat why have i never been accused of  stealing jewelry from somebody's house or whatever or was it was a jewelry store wherever the fuck it  was or was it both i don't know it might have been no i don't know i think there was something that  happened on a set and there was something that happened in a jewelry store it's just one it's one 
[00:41:30]  thing after another and i know a lot of it's probably bullshit because they can't trust the tabloids  right but it's not all bullshit right it couldn't all be bullshit and then then i got someone that's  being ridiculously picky on twitter you know the whole tiger thing and the hitting of the pin we  just discussed because uh tiger made six on 15 not eight or nine my point is then they gave him an  extra two strokes so that was an eight or nine technically that's what i was trying to say oh boy 
[00:42:00]  so instead of having a birdie or a par he ended up having an eight or nine when everything was said  and done in the end doesn't matter he told you whatever it's just frustrating at times  so i guess lohan wants to come on our show so you can rip your tongue out yeah that's what he's  using words like teach you respect and rip your tongue out like that's all like then i went to his  promo nonsense then i did go to his twitter i i would never follow him i would never in general give  a fuck about what he writes but he kind of you know involved us and there's religious 
[00:42:30]  shit there then then the next tweet he wants to fucking knock someone's head off he's lost  that's what's really funny he seems a little confused he tweets about god and all that and  it's like well yeah you obviously are very genuine obviously a very genuine guy yeah that's obvious  it's it's obvious that all your god tweets are genuine when you want to rip someone's be one or the  other be godly or be an aggressive dick don't try to be both right yeah fuck them 
[00:43:00]  oh someone's saying uh hey ope check out her interview on the red carpet  for scary movie she's this guy says we have no idea she's high as shit i am that's bud underscore rocks  she looks all high supposedly she was late for that too  oh at every turn there's something going on but you're gonna be mad at the jim norton  do you got her on the red carpet what creeps me out is how old how much older she looks than 
[00:43:30]  her age oh here we go uh dolce oh it's gorgeous thank you all right now we're doing live tweets  from fans because my dress was left in new york actually it was they packed the wrong dress so  oh no well this worked out very well for you thank you we're doing live tweets from fans and one of  them wants to know about your album are you working on writing an album what kind of music  would you do i don't want guitar recently um uh so yeah i'm working on it we'll see what happens 
[00:44:00]  i'll be nonsense so maybe i'll have time to do that how do you get used to this i mean watching  i don't think you do i think you just go numb now i mean looking at that it's just so overwhelming it  it is but you just i i don't know what are you looking forward to about the movie tonight  on my scene because charlie's seen most of it and i haven't seen any of it  lips i'm looking forward to seeing what happens if you have a great time she looks like she's under 
[00:44:30]  the influence i have no idea but i mean she has to start rehab in what may and she's just wandering  around looking like she's under the influence she's got them like that's just rubbing it in everyone's  face and tara reed voice uh that voice where you know you've been up smoking and drinking all night  i'm more annoyed at the interviewers it's just such fluff garbage it is just crap i know that the  publicist there in their fucking ear well the problem is i mean you get one shot at it so you 
[00:45:00]  know that i get it now in a way that reporter asked the real questions that's the last time she's  gonna be on the red carpet that's the problem wow because they're all in cahoots together  that's why you don't get any real interview questions ever in those situations especially  look every time we act up it'd fucking cost us at this point you know one little act up and and and  you know we get penalties yeah get penal penalized but it's these weird little is these penalized 
[00:45:30]  these fearful actors and and and fucking musicians who are too scared to answer questions about anything  like i i there's nothing an interviewer could ask me without i'd be like oh i don't know that wasn't  in the prequest that was in the pre-interview guys yeah i just have such a fucking loathing  for celebrities that won't answer questions well that's why you know letterman got a little  shit because he's sitting there he's he's seeing this train wreck and he and he's not going to do the  fluff questions yeah he's like no man there's something obviously happening here i'm gonna 
[00:46:00]  fucking you know talk about it here and then she gets all mad like oh my god i can't believe you're  not you know playing the game like everyone else everyone else is ignoring what what i'm doing and  making believe they don't see me as a train wreck as soon as you're the guy that finally decides to be  honest with the whole thing yeah yeah you're looked at as a jerk it's like doesn't doesn't she realize  doesn't her father realize these websites are rooting for her to fuck up like these websites 
[00:46:30]  that you're giving interviews to and quotes to and all your dumb nonsense they're rooting against her  oh yeah yeah because they make their living i don't give a fuck if she does well or not i'd rather see  her get sober it's not going to affect our job they they thrive on her fucking up yeah everyone's  writing again today who the fuck gets a two-month delay to party it up when when the rehab is uh  court ordered you get two months more it's unbelievable how about you just one of us if  we had to go into rehab you go into rehab pretty much instantly pretty much how about you just go 
[00:47:00]  how about you just fucking you stand up for yourself and you just go to rehab right how about that you're  talking to me no no no no i would never yell that at you but i have been praying for you  and going back to the fame whore thing with michael lohan i forgot this part of it and uh this guy  nola sean reminds me uh opie in his tweet to you he tagged lindsey's twitter handle even his dust  up with you was calculated calculated for exposure and followers did he really did he really do that 
[00:47:30]  yeah it was that lindsey lohan too there's only one reason you would do that knowing you would get  more eyes on your tweet doesn't even it doesn't even call his daughter like the name it's her  fucking twitter handle it's not just lindsey or l right it's her twitter oh yeah he absolutely was in  there i forgot about that part of it thank god my parents aren't on fucking twitter how embarrassing  your parents are on twitter at mentioning you oh yeah that would be how embarrassing 
[00:48:00]  so that that went down on i guess late friday night was it if red bar online called my father about  something personal about me or any of these websites about me uh about my rehab or drinking he'd probably  he wouldn't know what to do first of all because he's a fucking regular guy he's not a yeah you  know he's not desperate for fame he'd probably go i don't know uh okay we'll ask him uh bye-bye now  like there'd be a tape recording my father saying bye-bye now see a bye-bye now type of guy all right 
[00:48:30]  oh bye-bye now bye-bye i just can't picture my parents embarrassing themselves or me yeah i just can't  picture that well uh more celebrity news i guess did anybody watch the old mtv movie awards last  night huh huh holy fuck i tried i but but can i say this really quickly yeah i i don't know if it's  because i'll speak for myself i'm finally getting old no it's not sure positive because i always pride 
[00:49:00]  myself in obviously we're in a business that you got to kind of stay young and and all this  shit so i prided myself uh being in touch with all this but i'm losing it i'll break the wall  down for you yeah go ahead how i know it's not yeah i was watching it with somebody who was 18 years  old last night there you go there you go and and i asked that very question that would be in her  wheelhouse right mtv movie awards exactly her wheelhouse so okay so i i i that's great i asked that 
[00:49:30]  very question i'm like this and i said it exactly like this this is fucking awful this is terrible  i go you gotta answer me is it because i have no idea what the fuck is going on here am i out of  touch or does this suck and uh and he was like no no and she was like yeah this is this is horrible  this is like it's drivel and the bits went on and on and they they weren't funny right and and 
[00:50:00]  was that fat aussie trying to be like what is she trying to be like cute and oh well you know you're  fat but but you make it up with your spunk she's actually a funny comedian she stinks who is she  what's her name uh she's been around rebel wilson oh she's and and she's an australian but she gets  horrible but she gets horrible parts in these movies oh she's terrible she's barely in these movies  i hate having to what was the last movie like people because they're fat well she was in bridesmaids 
[00:50:30]  she had a little part in bridesmaids all right but she's not the fatty from bridesmaids but she  no she's a she's just in the beginning i forgot what she was in bridesmaid again it was a weird part  right uh it's her and her yeah she was a roommate oh right she was a brother or something and the  brother right right yeah that's a pretty funny scene but they did uh there's a big uh culty almost  like bring it on i gotta preface what you're about to say with the fact that this is the last  year you're relevant as far as 29 yeah yeah i know so you're getting pushed out too well it's becoming 
[00:51:00]  more work too to really what do you mean keep up on what's happening why for me i mean why is it more  work because i have to make an effort to make sure that i'm aware of what kids are paying attention to  it's not that stuff you like because you're not watching it just because you like to watch it you have  to make an effort because the the the motive is to be relative or relevant not hey i like this so  i'm gonna watch it know it anyway right like i have to make sure i'm not just sitting there watching 
[00:51:30]  recorded shows that i like five years ago yeah or music that i like 10 years ago all right so  an 18 year old uh girl hated it a 29 year old man boy hated it you hate it yeah yeah it was really bad  and and another man hated it you didn't cover it she's an 18 year old girl a 29 year old man oh  and fucking what geriatric no no no the guy with tuberculosis

[00:52:30]  but he but he was smart enough to turn it around and acknowledges that you know they rehearsed it they  rehearsed it just like that yeah did you see that clip yeah he was going for a kanye west moment  he was he got his award and who was the chick that came up and grabbed the fucking popcorn  aubrey plaza from parks and rec right she's grabbing at it grabbing at it and then it was  kind of awkward because obviously it wasn't working and then she let go and sat back down  and i guess will was smart enough to acknowledge that it probably didn't work as well as he was hoping 
[00:53:00]  none of those he was able to spin it none of their bits worked not a one they all petered out like  none of them had an ending or anything they stunk well you got some uh highlights should we do the  highlights highlights well you want to do the highlights after the break we've covered a lot  already here what's your message break what's the six strangled one beheaded in cancun that was the  award show that sounds great yeah uh yeah because we got to talk about jamie fox too

[00:54:00]  a resort but it's mexican i don't know where they were from it's for the mexicans that go to mexico  a mexican resort yeah i think so you still got to drive through the crappy part to get to the resort  you know iraq acapulco has been fucking has been devastated by this shit uh they were independent  drug dealers not any links to a specific they were drug dealers indy but the fact that you're still  people still go down there is fucking mind-bending all right we're gonna talk about mexico we're  gonna talk about mtv movie awards we're gonna talk about louis ck special i'm sure a lot of people 
[00:54:30]  fucking uh watched and louis uh louis is very uh happy that you did and i also want to talk about  the uh episode of vice with uh indian pakistan that's how the world's gonna end yeah pakistan that's  how the world's gonna end great right and they're gonna fight over water eventually and then where  they're gonna have to fight and they and you know that once two nuclear powers get into a brawl 
[00:55:00]  and one starts losing what are you gonna do you're gonna be like blaze of glory we surrender here now  you win you take our missiles take our you gotta launch and when you live with the fact that these  countries have you know nuclear warheads pointing at each other yeah in the back of your mind you're like  all right well god forbid a couple go off it'll suck for those people but my life will be fine  here in america but they they have estimated that all it takes is about a hundred to go off 
[00:55:30]  and if it's an all-out war like you said a scenario where one guy's they're losing a little bit so  they're going to pop off a few extra and then they're going to pop off yeah if if it gets up to a  hundred end of the world you got that's all it takes a hundred of those fucking things going off  end of the world that's it there would be some massive outrage the first person that uses a nuke  now is really going to be chastised in the world i mean they are really going to take some  shit i hope people are checking out vice and hbo it's a terrific little show yeah it's a quick half 
[00:56:00]  hour too which i like i was watching uh a show on hiroshima and nagasaki and um man just the  fucking devastation and those were nothing compared to what they have now but it also made me think  like yeah you look at you look at hiroshima and it's a a fucking living beautiful city now a modern  city because of all that it's amazing they got better stuff than us they were nuked yeah they 
[00:56:30]  had an atomic bomb dropped on them and were able to rebuild into a beautiful city uh and then there's  detroit oh boy we almost made it why can't it's the first break why can't a city that was almost made  it especially when we said the jamie fox that was yes we almost made it close we almost made an hour  the city was nuked it was literally nuked and now it's prosperous and it's amazing prosperous 
[00:57:00]  vibrant living and uh detroit well not so much black people huh black people i heard there's a  large uh african-american population in detroit it's true i'm not saying that i'm just saying  detroit i mean flint even got a movie so i guess they couldn't fix itself i think the point you're  making here is if we nuke the place then it'll start prospering well and it'll be built up into  a brand new city right well as long as we i guess import some japanese into it apparently can rebuild 
[00:57:30]  very well well we rebuilt them really yeah yeah yes we rebuilt them that was our guilt but we can't  rebuild detroit that's what i'm saying yeah we should rebuild detroit well we were trying actually  detroit went broke and uh they decided that we'll get an emergency guy in there to look at all the  corruption and bullshit that's been happening under this democratic fucking government they've had for  decades and uh and now that's being protested by the likes of jesse jackson and reverend allen and all  the um uh black politicians that um don't want themselves put out of the loop and have some 
[00:58:00]  emergency funding come in to actually try to save detroit they would rather just keep their jobs and and  keep those decisions going and that corruption going uh then then help detroit and the people  of detroit it's disgusting yeah they're actually protesting that this emergency management has been  uh put in place in detroit so why don't we get some footage of asian kids crying in detroit oh well

[01:00:00]  statue of liberty and there was this thing floating in the water chris saw it i said what is that and  it was this big thing and it was dark it was night it was like one in the morning so it looked like  you know like a big round raft that's what it looked like to me and i yelled over hey is anyone in  that boat and then we noticed that it was coming towards us like kind of with some speed and chris  goes get the fuck away from that thing like it was creepy so i backed away from it and i put a light  on it and it was it was like it looked like a giant manhole cover sticking out of the river this was the 
[01:00:30]  weirdest night fucking ever and it's right by the statue of liberty it's like i don't know 20 feet  across and it's moving it's leaving awake so i call up and then this woman came on this is  new york harbor coast guard give me your phone number so i give him my number this guy calls  he goes describe it as well as you can i go i don't want to cause a problem but it looks like  the hatch of a submarine and it's headed towards lower manhattan that's what i'm seeing and i'm  sure it's not that but my main concern is it's not lit and it could cream anything that hits it's  going down and the guy goes all right well i'll call about and send them to you so he hangs up and 
[01:01:00]  like 20 minutes later there's nobody there so anyway i call back and they're not sending anybody and  i and i at one point i got crazy and i was like you are the coast guard and i am saying to you now  there's a submarine attacking lower manhattan i'm saying it and they're like uh we're trying to get  park police over here i'm like send a fucking helicopter and he kept asking me to hover we  kept hovering around it and stuff and then finally this big police boat comes shines like a massive  light on it and then he calls me on the radio hey captain are you the one who uh reported this and

[01:03:00]  allow us to measure time in foreskins that day has come with sixty nine thousand nine hundred seventy one  foreskins per mile and the average indycar hitting speeds of up to two hundred fourteen miles per hour  that equals a speed of fourteen million nine hundred seventy three thousand seven hundred ninety four  foreskins per hour or fph p you i wonder what a burnout would smell like stay tuned for another edition of  how much the date is october 11th 1983 it's 7 18 pm detective club soda with self-professed organized crime

[01:27:30]  what it was but i found found myself attracted to rebel wilson last night you did right yep oh  so i'm not the only one i don't know if it was  fucking god i don't know if it was her confidence on stage i don't know what exactly it was but i found  myself attracted to her i saw the full shot of her though and i was like oh all right those  that'd be embarrassing to have those huge leather pants on your bedroom  you'd look down and just be like oh  i would definitely say to myself what's wrong with you and there's three cows worth of leather 
[01:28:00]  on my floor peter would be so upset  i can't it's always been i just can't like i was never able to go out a woman taller than me or that  wore bigger pants just could never do it taller i wouldn't mind i know yeah your pants yeah yeah  but my dumb thing i couldn't you wouldn't want to get into the pants and take a picture with the  waist like stuck out like a like an after photo here's hold on here's where every guy assesses 
[01:28:30]  who he's with at any given moment uh because when you get into some hijinks you're usually around uh  the bed whatever it is before everybody's completely naked you know this is your basic  fucking love making thing uh but after all is said and done when the girl gets up to go to the  bathroom right and you now you can turn your head and watch them walk away that's when you assess your  life right there and go what the fuck and if you saw rebel wilson walking down that fucking 
[01:29:00]  hallway or i'd be like to the bathroom door you'd fucking hate yourself how many  fucking drinks did i have last night yes i don't know maybe it's because i never have been with an  obese woman you've been with black chicks yeah but none of them were obese really yeah  well you must have hit the low percentage i jumped on top of one once it's like being on a  fucking water bed i've rocked that's what i'm saying and then i started the more i thought 
[01:29:30]  about it the more it seemed appealing with rebel wilson specifically some of that shit's okay  until the sun comes up and then you're like oh my fucking god you'd be dogging that like like just  just grabbing a no i know you shouldn't have to know that part of it and hold your hands  as far apart as you would if you were bringing in an air conditioner into your house  like your fucking arms are like you're fucking three feet apart you're absolutely right i can't i  can't disagree with that i'm just saying her face and her skin the blonde hair yeah i still want to 
[01:30:00]  all right even with that description yeah yeah i bet she gets plenty of fucking action probably  you know there are chubby chases out there and i guess if you're a chubby chaser she's probably  fucking a 10 yeah oh i would imagine kiss the skin tags under the armpit oh i don't think she's  developed those yet how old the gal is inside of the neck is she oh i don't know i don't think she 
[01:30:30]  has skin the neck folds or armpit do you like that those skin tabs i would think of scraping my teeth  on them i'd say she's like early 30s maybe she's 27 27 yeah so here's uh rebel wilson who hosted the  mtv movie awards something about a koala bear camera that has x-ray vision yeah hey everyone  so i brought along my koala tonight her name is chlamydia she's a bit of a slut  but she does have amazing x-ray vision so i thought we'd just go into the vip section

[01:32:00]  did she use like a camera why are they like in their bra and panties in the audience or something  why is it x-ray what's going on that's just it they have the she's holding the puppet she walks up to  someone and you see that and they cut like obviously to what's supposed to be the camera and it's like  they're showing inside the little black kids pocketbook and there's all booze in there  but she's only nine yeah why wouldn't the people be naked why is it well they show vision for just 
[01:32:30]  certain things well they showed one with like panties and a lot of hair sticking out of it  yeah but when the panties would go away too with x-ray hey hey i hate the x-ray vision bit  because they're never completely naked it's it's just wouldn't it just be skeletons  wouldn't it be outside the building yes of course wouldn't it be in outer space that's  why i hated the x-ray vision bits of course you're just shooting the bag well that's dumb  it stunk every bit she did and then when she incorporated they incorporated her into the 
[01:33:00]  movies oh and it went it the fucking bit she was in les mis and they incorporate her in  and and and it went on and on and on it did it fucking i couldn't believe how long this  fucking bit was and then it finally ends and i go oh thank god and they go to another movie  i was it was like i was sitting there going like they can't be doing a montage out of this they just

[01:40:00]  he was the midget and elf right yes where he ran across the the the conference table but it  took forever to get to the other side because basically midgets take longer to  run i guess what they were trying to portray their little legs in that fine movie isn't he a uh  dwarf huh dwarf yeah i guess they're all you know i call them all midget yeah it just makes  it easier a lot easier well that midget word out there it's up to them to fucking uh figure out  what they really are i don't have time yeah yeah i just know you're a little guy i'll just yeah

[01:42:00]  is just i love just god like jamie fox i heard he has a huge cock jamie fox  respect that people treat this guy like he is the greatest thing that has ever graced the  fucking screen i thought that was him yeah that's what he thinks right he absolutely thinks he's  amazing and and they pump him up like that oh he's just great is this it right here 
[01:42:30]  with his trayvon fucking shirt oh oh he went with the trayvon of course he did now here's my  fucking problem anyone want to jump in we already know it yeah it's one word  he uh you know mtv wouldn't allow certain people to wear certain other political statement shirts  up on their their stage you just know they wouldn't allow it they actually what they 
[01:43:00]  cube out everything they can fucking like products and shit like that but well no they  all right your point sorry i'll shut up no no it's if if you went out there with a  a political shirt i mean i mean there have been people in the past that have uh you know gotten  uh told not to wear certain things and and then he comes out with this trayvon thing he goes no  justice no peace and no is k-n-o-w but the n-o is in red it's just it's just no justice no 
[01:43:30]  what do you think about justice when it is a court case going going on like don't worry about the  justice it'll fucking come out it's not justice for trayvon it's justice just justice for fucking  for everyone for the truth to come out it's also the sandy hook kids around trayvon well of course it  is but trayvon's giant fucking you know yeah in the middle because he's much more important even though 
[01:44:00]  it's even though the zimmerman case has been blown out of proportion because of the racial angle of  course it it's still i don't find him to be a likable guy zimmerman in the sense that  whatever happened is this guy trayvon martin was not bothering him you don't know that i but i believe  that like just from that phone call i i believe that he was a neighborhood watchman yeah who made  a judgment error he was returned i don't think he made a judgment error at all i think if fucking  if there's somebody in the neighborhood and they have been uh uh there have been break-ins in the 
[01:44:30]  neighborhood and that's why he's part of the neighborhood watch and he sees somebody who he  deems uh out of place in the neighborhood it's his job to question the motherfucker but i understand that  i understand why he did i understand yeah what made him i would look at a guy like that and probably  think that too sure but he was wrong the guy was going to get skittle he was he even though it's like  whenever a cop shoots somebody and that person's unarmed the cop is wrong i know why the cop did it 
[01:45:00]  i don't think the cop did it because he's evil but you're either right or you're wrong about something  and in this case he was wrong and he was wrong at what point at the at the shooting in point at the  point that he paid attention to what he was doing in the first place like where do you decide he was  wrong i think he was wrong he obviously was pursuing the guy and i and again i know that he didn't have  to stop because 9-1-1 there was no pursuit an unarmed guy you're getting a lot of this news out of 
[01:45:30]  the news no but an unarmed guy got shot that's the truth it wasn't like trayvon martin was on the phone  with his girlfriend um and he was worried about this guy keeps looking at me he was a guy walking  through the neighborhood he had no gun tray uh george roman had a gun and now this guy's dead however it  happened that then here's what his judgment error was he should have pulled his gun and showed it  before it got to that which would have probably because that would have prevented the problem  nobody would approach you with a gun pointed at them i don't believe anybody would if he fired in 
[01:46:00]  defense then his mistake was allowing himself to get his fucking ass kicked while he had a pistol on  him well that was his judgment error instead of pulling it out not even killing the guy but  showing him i got a pistol dummy that's not really the way it's supposed to work but this is not  the way it's supposed to work either well it's called uh self-defense and and the bottom line is  he went to check this guy out he's walking around the neighborhood he went to check him out and as he 
[01:46:30]  was walking back to his vehicle trayvon pounced on him and started beating his face in and pounding  his head on the fucking uh sidewalk at the last moment he decided i'm getting fucking pummeled and i'm  gonna be knocked out he pulled his gun out one shot and uh trayvon's dead but his walking back to  the vehicle thing is and i and i do think trayvon was on top of him and i do think they had a fight  but i don't how do you know it was that's the way it really was as opposed to them being face to face 
[01:47:00]  and having a confrontation like because his story is that the guy it makes him a lot less believable  or a lot less empathetic zimmerman if they had a head-to-head confrontation and he had a pistol  and an unarmed guy who really wasn't bothering him winds up dead it's really hard to it doesn't  come into play in a self-defense case when you're getting your head smashed against because the arm  is your fucking hands uh banging a man's head against concrete so that becomes uh using using 
[01:47:30]  the sidewalk as a deadly weapon no i understand that and i understand why you'd use your gun in that  situation but they weren't two guys that bumped heads in a club and then and then they started  fighting outside i'd be a hundred percent on zimmerman's side if that was the case  and i don't think zimmer was this terrible racist but the bottom line was he was one of these  fucking neighborhood watch guys who just instead of you called the cops he shouldn't have been that  close to him he did call the cops i know that and that's what he should have done but he shouldn't 
[01:48:00]  have been that close to him on foot he shouldn't have been or if he was going to then he should  have been able to handle that situation without fucking pulling out his gun and shooting the guy  he should have showed him the pistol in the past and he said it uh on on the phone in the past he  had he goes oh these guys always get away because they always get away so he was watching where this  guy was going you know it's it's easy after the fact to go oh he's unarmed he's just got his skittles  he's walking home he don't fucking know that he sees a guy with the fucking hoodie up walking around 
[01:48:30]  the neighborhood wearing pretty much fucking burglary fucking clothes i love that hoodies  up for treyvon look at every close circuit security camera it's a guy with a fucking hoodie up knock it  off how that's the new fucking uh a dress code for tribute but all of those guys aren't him i know  what you're saying but it's like he fit the fucking profile but it was sorry but it was wrong what  he was wrong because he was i i firmly believe he wasn't there okay all right like i think that 
[01:49:00]  the profile that uh fat nick when he hit those guys with bats was right they were there to rob cars  yeah he was right he profiled them and he was correct this guy profiled incorrectly so how did  it so how did it end up with treyvon banging his head against this dumb motherfucker didn't pull  his pistol out and you know you can't pull your pistol out like that he wasn't posing a threat 
[01:49:30]  at that point you can't pull your pistol out unless your life is in danger well then if you have a  pistol if you have a pistol and there's a guy that doesn't and you're following him he doesn't know he  doesn't have a pistol at that point but i'm saying he doesn't yeah if you have a gun and the other guy  doesn't have a gun yeah and somehow that other guy gets you on the ground when you're approaching him  you're a dummy that goes to show you the fucking restraint who shouldn't have a gun that shows you  restraint if you ask me the guy didn't want to pull his gun out he's not brandishing his gun at 
[01:50:00]  every guy with a hoodie walking down the street that would be irresponsible if you ask me he he he's  keeping tabs on where this guy is until the police show up in that interim the guy turns around and starts  punching him in the face but you got to look at it from the other guy's point of view too this guy's  just walking somewhere and this fucking asshole is following him following is not a fucking crime  yeah but following is not turning around and punching him in the face that's a crime yeah but 
[01:50:30]  you understand as a person how enraging it would be if you're walking through and some  fucking douchebag is following you like what the fuck does this guy what if he didn't know what this  guy wanted like let's just say zimmerman's account is a bit you know as told by him let's just say  that trayvon martin's walking home this guy's following him and he's like why is this guy  fucking following me and he turns around there's a confrontation zimmerman goes where are you going  what are you doing and this guy's like who the fuck are you and slugs him like i'm not saying he 
[01:51:00]  should have slugged him exactly but you don't understand why he'd be fucking bothered that this  guy is following him at night for no reason perhaps but you know what like you understand  george zimmerman's point of view like why he pulled the gun and shot him but how come you  can't understand trayvon's point of view like what when you're walking home why this would be  fucking worrisome or bothersome it might be but unfortunately that's the world we live in when  you see a guy uh a a black kid with a hoodie walking in your neighborhood and you're the neighborhood  watch guy that's the guy you have to check out sorry good bad and it's not zimmerman's fault it's 
[01:51:30]  every thug that dresses like that to fuck with people it was i'll tell you why it's zimmerman's  fault because if he was qualified to handle this situation yeah it would not have gotten to call  the police and was keeping an eye on who he suspected might be doing something wrong what that's that's  his guilt then he turned around away that deserved to get a punch in the face no but that's what again  that's his story i don't i don't know the whole story that's his account of witnesses uh uh what what 
[01:52:00]  the police saw after the fact i believe that he was on top of him i believe there was a physical  altercation and i believe trayvon was the guy doesn't have any past history of fucking with  people right in neighborhood watch of of assaulting people uh on on during his neighborhood watch uh  uh duties um the fact is trayvon escalated the violence if he's being followed that's one thing  you could turn around you go hey asshole what the fuck are you following me to escalate it to a 
[01:52:30]  physical confrontation made it so george zimmerman could defend himself and that's exactly what  happened and george zimmerman i think that george zimmerman was not qualified to handle this situation  mentally or would not call the cops and kept an eye on the guy how is that not qualified because he has  a gun and he was getting his ass kicked yes that could happen if you have a gun and you're following  someone and you get your ass kicked something is wrong but that's the fucking it's you're never 
[01:53:00]  gonna win every fight here's what that means just because you have a gun if trayvon had hit a little  harder this dumb motherfucker would have been walking with a gun yeah following a guy as the neighborhood  watch guy and i don't blame him for being suspicious or even for calling the cops i get i'm not politically  correct i get why you'd see a guy in a hoodie and go what's he doing here but once you make the decision  to get out and follow him and make yourself a part of the investigation you better be 
[01:53:30]  fucking qualified to handle that and what makes you qualified is reading the situation well a situation  well enough to not turn your back and get blindsided by a guy and wind up on the ground getting your ass  kicked you're actually blaming the victim that's that's amazing that's well that's what everybody who's  blaming trayvon is doing he's dead like yeah what stops us from fucking hitting cops we know they have  guns like honestly i think there's also a law but i mean the line actor in there man to man like which  stops a lot of people me and you yeah we don't want to go to jail but there's a lot of guys that 
[01:54:00]  literally are just afraid of getting shot yeah like they're not afraid of getting arrested they're  afraid of getting shot that's the cops ace in the hole it's not the legal system it's the fucking gun  they have in the moment and we all know they have a gun and that's the difference he didn't know this  guy had a gun so if you're going to follow a guy you better be in a position to let him know look  i'm armed you better let him know that instead of turning your back and walking away i don't know  where he went though can you picture a cop just turning his back and walking i mean maybe but if that 
[01:54:30]  was if he was a cop i think he would have handled that situation better oh a cop has even a lot more  training absolutely exactly absolutely that's what i'm talking about an undercover cop even would  have handled that better because he would have known how to follow this guy he would have known  how to talk to him and he would have known how to make it apparent that he had a weapon and unless  trayvon was a maniac i don't see him charging a guy with a weapon i don't see you getting caught in 
[01:55:00]  a situation like that i don't see you getting caught in a situation where a guy won't know you have a  gun on a dark street where you're going to turn around and walk away if that's what actually  happened uh from a guy who i just don't see that you think he's dangerous so zimmerman thinks he's  dangerous enough to call the cops he's safe enough to get out of the car because he has a gun i think  if you you want to say any mistake that he made is the fact that he didn't i don't think he did think  he was dangerous i think he thought he was up to shenanigans okay or at least suspected that you know 
[01:55:30]  it should be looked into a little more that's what i'm saying uh i don't think he thought he was  dangerous uh which it was a mistake on his part i think um other than that i i just i don't see this  as um him just because zimmerman has a gun that that made it so he he's in the wrong if he for some  reason he's not in the wrong because he had a gun and again he's not in the wrong because he's 
[01:56:00]  profiled trayvon people profile each other all the time yeah in this case it was wrong sometimes  you profile people it's wrong it happens i mean i'm uncomfortable when i see five middle eastern  guys getting on a plane probably every time in my lifetime i've been wrong and i understand that  it's you know profiling there is a fucking a penalty with it i'm not saying it's always right we're wrong  sometimes the bottom line is he wasn't qualified to handle that because an undercover cop i'm not saying  with the uniform where trayvon would have seen the uniform and said all right i'll talk to you 
[01:56:30]  an undercover would have handled that situation i think better i'm not saying an undercover couldn't  have had this happen but i think an undercover would have understood enough about the intricacies  of following somebody or or what happens when you when because i think he knew that zimmerman saw  him like zimmerman knew that trayvon was aware of him so he didn't think like well i followed the  guy and he doesn't know i'm here so i'll turn around he knew there was something happening between  them so if he turns around and walks away and gets blindsided he was going back to his truck 
[01:57:00]  okay but then he's he's remarkably unaware of his surroundings and if you're in a dark street  you're getting out where the fuck are you following this guy to that all of a sudden you're like okie  dokie how do you not have you ever you ever watch a cop on the street you fucking watch he's got his  hand on his gun all the time so nobody can come up and snatch it he'll be on the phone cops don't even  realize they're doing it get the right hand on that fucking pistol so this guy's in a potentially  confrontational situation and he doesn't have his hand on his pistol i'm not saying he should brand 
[01:57:30]  his shit and be an asshole like fucking peshy but the fact that he's so ill-prepared to use the weapon  which is the one thing giving him the balls to get out of that car and follow this guy perhaps if they  did have a face-to-face confrontation that x escalated into yelling or whatnot perhaps then he might  have put did some type of indication that he had a gun hand on his hip uh pull his shirt back a little  bit something but the fact of the matter is they never had that face-to-face confrontation it it went 
[01:58:00]  from zero to 90 it went from from i'm looking at him i'm watching him he knows i'm here he knows i'm  looking to i'm being punched in the face i'm on the ground there's someone on top of me beating my head in  and that's his that's his account uh-huh and that's his account which and evidence shows that's  some of it's true and i probably accurate at least i believe again the media was reprehensible i don't  think this is some terrible he's a terrible racist or that he was you know i believe trayvon was on top 
[01:58:30]  of him and hitting him i'm not sure what led up to that we only have zimmerman's account but i do believe  that he was getting his ass kicked yeah so i don't say he's a terrible murderer who should be put to death  but he's not innocent he because he was not qualified if this is what what qualifications  are there for fucking neighborhood watch uh obviously he he's doing this for the good of  his neighborhood uh or a lot of people have uh accused him of being a little you know uh rambunctious 
[01:59:00]  about uh a wannabe cop they've called him things like that uh the thing is he wasn't trained like a  police officer he wasn't supposed to be trained like police but he was acting like one  but he was acting like a neighborhood watch guy that's watching someone while he's on the phone  if it put it this way if he wasn't on the phone with the cops and and decided to tackle this guy  and had cuffs on him and and thought he was going to do it that way i might feel what you're saying  but this guy was doing everything a neighborhood watch guy's supposed to he had called the cops in 
[01:59:30]  the past on people the cops had shown up he called him this time he was keeping an eye on the  because why would you want to lose the guy you just called the cops on well that's the difference  between a neighborhood watch guy and a cop there isn't he's not a police officer and i'm not saying  he didn't have the right to follow him we absolutely did but this guy wound up dead and he wasn't like  it wasn't like this guy was some fucking some some hardened thug who is the type of some guy wasn't  the 10 year old they show on the fucking news i'm not talking about the news i'm talking about that's 
[02:00:00]  for sure well that's what everyone thinks the impression you get when i say trayvon martin in  everyone's head they see a little kid in a football uniform no i don't i see not the fucking 17 year old  thug with the fucking grill in his mouth tweeting about fucking uh getting some weed and and fucking  bitches that's what every that's it that doesn't mean that that a guy who does that is not necessarily  going to turn around and knowingly punch a guy in the face who's holding a pistol exactly but  that's not how he's been portrayed to the public but the media is irrelevant in this 
[02:00:30]  no they're very relevant but i don't care about them for me they don't influence what i'm saying  i don't i'm not i'm not you're saying they influence the way people are hearing what you're saying though  and what i'm saying it influences people hear me and go oh wow but because all they have to base  their opinion on is the crap they've seen on the fucking news but i'm not doing that i'm i'm telling  you i'm just prefacing i'm saying zimmerman didn't handle this right because this guy wound up dead  if this guy was in zimmerman dead though uh if not i don't think if zimmerman handled it right he 
[02:01:00]  would have been the reason i said that is because this is not that guy i don't think if this was a  guy who did fucking eight years in jail for assault and we all know what a fucking true thug from jail  is there are guys that will punch the cops in the face there are those fucking guys i would have a  different opinion but i don't think this was that guy well when you're beating somebody's head  against the sidewalk you're taking the chance that that person is armed and will fucking retaliate  with deadly force when you're following a guy at night you're taking a chance that that guy is going 
[02:01:30]  to confront you and have a problem with you so you have a gun you had better be prepared to at least  showing a gun is that is a huge deterrent and i know you can't walk around waving it but if you're  in that confrontation you better be ready to pull your because how did he know trayvon didn't have  a gun exactly so so then he was so fucking ill prepared to handle the fact that trayvon martin may 
[02:02:00]  have a knife he he would have been stabbed to death he underestimated the fact that he would even punch  him then he's not then then to me he did something wrong i know this could happen to a real cop or an  undercover i just don't believe it i i agree with you in the fact that uh everything didn't go  fucking uh lovingly during this there were mistakes that were made obviously things could have been  done to prevent any of it from happening but that's what happened you can't say oh this shouldn't have 
[02:02:30]  happened that he shouldn't ended up dead that this is what happened now you got to work with why did  it happen and and is he um culpable for the for the for the death is is is is he uh he's up for  for murder too will he be convicted of that i don't see it i see this as a case of self-defense  see i i i think it's in the middle i don't think he's necessarily a murderer because i really i don't  believe that he set out to murder this dude no and i don't believe that he was like fuck this black 
[02:03:00]  bastard i mean i really don't think that at all but i don't think that zimmerman is just a victim  of circumstance because when you have a pistol you take a certain responsibility with that sure and  again if this was a bar fight where they met outside and this guy just got in his face and  started i'd be a hundred percent on zimmerman's side fuck him or even if they were just yelling at  each other outside of 7-11 and zimmerman was taken off guard but he wasn't taken off guard 
[02:03:30]  he instigated this he followed him as a neighborhood watch okay fair enough that's  like saying if you see some somebody around you walking in the hallways of your apartment  and and you you don't do anything about it you know you see somebody like no no i'm not saying  that but he did something about it but there's some there's a breakdown in the system neighborhood  watch guy went from behaving like an undercover he's not an undercover he wasn't qualified to  behave like a neighborhood watch guy i don't understand how you're putting him in this 
[02:04:00]  situation where where he had to act a certain way like like somebody that should just sit there  and call the cops he's got to keep an eye on this guy but look what happened yeah he was the other  guy wound up on top of him because how dumb a guy are you if you have a gun and you're following  someone and they wind up on top of you you're a dope you shouldn't have a pistol if you can't if you  can't handle if you don't know enough to have your pistol ready especially following a guy who 
[02:04:30]  you think is dangerous enough to rob houses which means he probably has burglary equipment with him  which means he at least has a fucking screwdriver so you're following a guy who you assume has a  weapon he's assuming this guy has something maybe not a machine gun but he's assuming this guy has  something and yet he's not prepared to use his weapon until he's having his fucking head beaten in  there's something missing from that picture i see that as showing very great restraint and  responsibility as a gun owner yeah you don't you don't use it at all until your life is fucking 
[02:05:00]  being threatened no great restraint would have been pulling it uh or having his hand on it or or being  ready to use it and shooting him in the leg or even the stomach like that would have been great  that would i don't know that would have been better restraint he had no reason to shoot him or even  show his gun until his life was being threatened well then the fact that he got into the not  threatened his life was on the line sure but then the then the fact that he got into that  the fact that he got into that position and caught off guard so completely is where my problem with 
[02:05:30]  him i can't believe you're writing off the fact that he was the one getting his face punched in  but i'm not writing that off as like oh he's an asshole for getting himself in that position that's  why i don't think he's a murderer that's why i don't think he should be convicted of murder  because i do believe he was getting his ass kicked my annoyance at him is getting into that  fucking position he there was a i have no problem with him calling the cops i have no problem with  him even being suspicious because i probably would have been but in that gray area where he got out of  the car and he followed him and the next thing you know he's getting his ass kicked and he has to 
[02:06:00]  shoot the guy in there is my fucking major problem with his qualification to be doing this you're a  watch guy watch but don't follow he's a wannabe cop dude he's one of these guys who wants to be  more important than he is i don't think he's evil but he's one of these fucking guys who probably  couldn't pass the police test wants to be that guy so his motives were probably a little bit more  about himself a little bit more that you can say that well then i have a problem with but but the 
[02:06:30]  bottom line and what the case is about is that the escalation of violence was started by trayvon  the physical altercation was started by trayvon he says that yes and well the physical evidence shows  that how do you know and again i'm not saying this is what happened but how do you know trayvon just  didn't go what the fuck do you want and zimmerman didn't push him or or how do you know that zimmerman  didn't grab him by the shirt or do something uh that was that was physically threatening to him 
[02:07:00]  well how do you know zimmerman didn't approach him aggressively and go where the where do you go  whoa whoa no no you're waiting right here you're staying right here like we don't know we only have  zimmerman's well you got his word you got other uh ear and eyewitnesses um but they only heard the  fight though right yeah so they didn't hear what led they didn't hear anything before that that  would have led anyone to believe that there was any altercation before uh trayvon was was hitting 
[02:07:30]  uh george zimmerman right so i mean again you got to go with with the evidence and the testimony of  the people that are still alive uh sorry but that's you know i i think and i've looked at a lot of the  shit i've read a lot of the fucking shit on this case and it really looks like a a pretty good  self-defense case to me that which is again why i don't think he's a murderer i don't even the cops 
[02:08:00]  that shot uh who was it that they should not absolutely they shot uh who's the african guy he  was uh mamu diallo oh yeah i'm a dude i'm sorry i i thought they should have been i i obviously thought  that they were completely wrong and really had to be yeah and had to be off the force because he pulled  out a wallet i'm sorry you shot a guy who didn't have a gun but i didn't think they should have went  to jail because i didn't think they were out to murder the guy i thought they made a horrible  horrible judgment error which means there's a difference to me between that and being a criminal  who goes to prison but i don't think you can just keep your job i think we the public have a right to 
[02:08:30]  say if you have a gun we have a certain expectation that you're going to get things right and there  are times where i can understand when you get things wrong uh with diallo they made a tremendous  judgment error it's a very it's always a fluid situation you never get this black and white  situation of well there's the line now we can shoot or there's the line now we can escalate  to this point it's always a very fluid very gray sure situation where where you're not sure what 
[02:09:00]  you're seeing what's going on so it's you're never going to get this absolute uh this is what  happened and and this is why and and and that's it like there's always going to be this element of  doubt or what if i did this or could i have done that differently and and stopped that from happening  so i mean that's every situation but when you're right but when someone is an unarmed non-criminal  and gets shot but yeah but you have a much a lot of times you don't know they're unarmed oh okay 
[02:09:30]  that's the big thing and and and the law gives you that latitude that if you reasonably believe  your life is being threatened that your your your death is imminent for you sure that you can use a  weapon to defend yourself and use deadly physical force to defend yourself absolutely it doesn't  necessarily mean that if someone is only holding iced tea and skittles that they did not pose a life 
[02:10:00]  threatening event to you but if you think somebody could be armed and it's at night and you're  following them yeah then and the only time you get to your gun is when they're on top of you beating  the shit out of you then you did something wrong because you can't play cop and then all of a sudden  act like civilian you're what you know don't don't follow this guy if you can't get the only time he can  get to his gun is when this guy's kicking the shit which means if trayvon martin if what zimmerman 
[02:10:30]  says is true if trayvon had a knife he would have stuck it in zimmerman's back and this dumb  motherfucker would have died following a guy with a gun strap and by the way you never ever would  have heard of his name trayvon nothing you never heard any again all that aside i agree with you 100%  the media repel about fuck the media i'm not even about that i know i get that been dead and i agree  with you yeah but that's not the point the point is that he imagine how unqualified you are to have 
[02:11:00]  a gun if you're following a guy and you handle it like this and wind up if you're following five guys  and one of them flanks you there's a difference i get it you're following one dude and you don't  know if he's armed or not and you're not ready to get to your fucking gun and you think he might be a  burglar then you're dumb that i think helps zimmerman more in the fact that he didn't know  any threat was coming at him until he was on the ground being hit but i don't believe that because 
[02:11:30]  i think that you understand there's an imminent threat or first of all you wouldn't have called  the cops or you wouldn't have followed him he thought there was something not a threat to himself  he thought the guy was pulling shenanigans perhaps he i'm sure his impression was here's a guy he's  probably gonna try to jimmy some cars or some shit like that and and didn't think oh here's a guy  with a gun that's gonna shoot me his guy with a knife was gonna stab me you gotta you gotta expect  there's gonna be some danger to it but i don't think enough danger was spelled out with a kid 
[02:12:00]  walking with a hoodie on for him to pull his gun out but there was enough danger for him to be  suspicious and call the cops not danger a threat that he was trying to uh break into a certain place if  we look at a guy in a hoodie and we profile him a black guy in a hoodie yeah and you think that he's  dangerous to the neighborhood he's gonna break into a house you think thug you think right uh a guy who's  a problem sure you know what i mean so am i gonna pull my gun out if we're gonna agree that point no  maybe not at that point of course not but if we're gonna agree that zimmerman profiled him and we 
[02:12:30]  understand why because we might have thought the same thing yeah then we have to be fucking honest  about it and go look i would have thought this black guy's a threat physically too not just a threat to the  a jimmy a car open but a guy who's here to burglarize a fucking house and probably has a  weapon on him because most people don't go out and commit rapes or burglaries without something on  them you don't go out with just you know so you have to assume that he thought there was some kind  of a threat and it i maybe that helps his case legally but to me morally that makes him a dumb 
[02:13:00]  motherfucker because he got caught out there after following the guy if zimmerman was walking  neighborhood watch and this guy blindsided him again i'd have no debate i'd have zero debate but that's  not what happened george zimmerman also says and from the from the uh call that he was making to  the police that trayvon ran off at that point he ran off and that's when zimmerman turned to go back  to his vehicle and i guess to get back in his vehicle and and and maybe use his car and drive 
[02:13:30]  around the streets to look for him uh so when he saw him run off i i guess he felt that he was no  longer a an imminent imminent threat to him how far was he from the vehicle when the assault occurred  i'm not sure okay exactly because how like how far did he stray from his vehicle um it wasn't that  far once he was told that we don't need you to do that and that's what the the 911 operator told him  he said are you are you following are you following him said yes because we don't need you to do that 
[02:14:00]  so he then did start going back to his vehicle so he's on the phone he starts to go he sees him run  off he's close to his car yeah but he can't get back to the car before this guy runs around yeah yeah  and runs up on him yeah and hits him he doesn't hear him coming he doesn't hear anything uh he's  just moseying back to his car thinking there's a potentially dangerous guy out there that he felt  threatened enough to call 911 and yet he just walks back to his car without looking over his shoulder 
[02:14:30]  without being aware of his surroundings i think you're putting more importance on the him feeling  this danger part i think he just felt he was in the neighborhood to to break in to do the break-ins  that have been done in his neighborhood then he again maybe you're right but then he was a dummy  to feel that way because anybody else would have felt there was a threat to this guy no there's no way  i would fucking look at a guy who i thought might be a criminal and in here to do fucking ill deeds  and not think that he's gonna be a threat to me if i follow him who how often do you follow a 
[02:15:00]  criminal and think they're not gonna fucking confront you or or have a physical problem you  know one of course you're gonna think well with the gun issue somebody that doesn't pull the gun out  until there's life is absolutely in danger is being a responsible gun owner believe it or not in  some circumstances i completely agree however uh a lot of times again cops pull out guns when things  are allowed no i know but but again you have to keep it concealed right you have to keep it concealed 
[02:15:30]  but in a confrontation like that you better let him know you have it the only time he knows you have  it is when you're shooting him how did he catch you off guard like that that's what bothers me so much  about the simmerman story is the fact that even if he's being totally honest yeah he's a fucking  dumb motherfucker who who handled that incorrectly because he got caught off guard like that while  following a guy well i guess we're just gonna have to agree that uh sam's an asshole i think that  everyone i think even that was on jamie fox's shirt see the phones are lit though oh my god 
[02:16:00]  very polarized i didn't even look at that you followed that bus one time yeah exactly  ah look at that exactly and i turned away when the guy looked at me and turned i'm like i'm going  home you felt like it could get ugly absolutely that bus that bus driver's alive today you were  super jimmy to a point and then realized you know what this is none of my fucking business anymore i  gotta get the fuck out of here yeah but i'm not i'm not believing what the media says about it i'm  just using common sense and there's something about his story which is bothering me 
[02:16:30]  and there's no answer to that the part that's bothering me there's no answer to other than  george zimmerman's word about it and if his word is correct again i don't think the man's a  murderer an intentional murderer uh-huh but he handled it wrong here's the fucking problem too  lisa georgia the authorities told him to stop pursuing no they didn't it wasn't the authorities  it's a dispatcher from uh uh emergency services which he doesn't have to listen they don't have  any authority whatsoever to tell anyone the person that is best suited to decide what is 
[02:17:00]  it should be done on the scene is the person that's on the scene sure they can't tell you to do  anything and they didn't say stop pursuing as i told you they said we don't need you to do that  and he stopped he was walking back to his vehicle at that point so again bullshit that is now fact in  the in the ether because it's been repeated enough times okay and you're gonna get that's not the 
[02:17:30]  truth you're gonna get people who spit out that media bullshit yeah but i want i do not have a fucking  comfortable explanation of how this guy wound up on he got blindsided then he's then he's a dummy  not really he fucking got blindsided by a guy who was a little more crafty than he was a guy who was  minding his business like if you want to play cop you want to play big boy cop then you better be  fucking ready to act like a cop and you better be savvy like a cop and you better be able to handle 
[02:18:00]  situations like in his mind maybe he wasn't playing cop maybe he was playing neighborhood watch guy who  had called the police why would you call the police if you want to fuck up some some black guy in your  neighborhood again i don't think he wanted to all right i don't think he wanted he did exactly what he  was supposed to do as a neighborhood watch guy he called the cops he kept an eye on the guy so we  didn't wouldn't just disappear when the cops show up you go oh where is he i don't know i don't know  where he is oh he's out there somewhere why not keep an eye on him but they didn't keep an eye on 
[02:18:30]  him long enough to not get beat up like he was keeping an eye on him when he thought a house might  be in danger well he was trying to keep an eye on him up until the time where he fucking ran off  and the and and and the dispatcher told him we don't need you to do that and he started walking  back to his vehicle he didn't run after him into the bushes man he fucking saw trayvon run off  started walking back to his vehicle trayvon came back around and blindsided him so you're saying  that in a quiet situation like that again this was not inner city this is a quiet neighborhood 
[02:19:00]  quiet enough people to hear like you said eyewitness earwitness account he didn't hear this guy or see  this guy approaching like i just i don't like the fact none of us know how we'll act in that  situation but i can tell you i'm jumpy enough to know that if i have a fucking gun on me yeah  and and i'm in that situation my hand is going to at least be on the butt of it you're you're if you're  not prepared to draw your weapon on a guy who might have a weapon and you're following him you're dumb 
[02:19:30]  you're dumb you shouldn't have a weapon or you should stay in the fucking car because you're not  qualified to know when to pull your weapon when not to pull your weapon i don't know where his hand was  at the time he got blindsided but as far as having your hand on your weapon off your weapon  he he showed responsible gun ownership by not fucking using the gun until his life was threatened  you're not allowed to pull your gun out you're not allowed to brandish it you're not even really 
[02:20:00]  allowed to let people know you have the fucking thing well then you should have stayed in the car  because the thing that gave him the courage to get out of the car was the gun that how do you know  he just didn't think this thug was walking around the neighborhood jimmy and fucking doors open with  a screwdriver and not being a threat he he didn't see someone walking around with an ak exactly or  something he saw somebody that fit the profile of other people that had broken into houses in that  neighborhood in the past and was looking at him calling the police and giving the police um uh 
[02:20:30]  instruction as to where this guy was he does not get out of that car if he does not have a gun i'm not  saying he doesn't call or he doesn't be a neighborhood watch and go look there's a dude walking around  i'll try to follow him in my car he does not get out of that nobody you don't get out of the car without  a weapon and just follow a criminal i don't buy it so what's the what's the point then if he gets out  of the car because he has the gun where are you going with that gun balls but not gun savvy like he has 
[02:21:00]  the the courage to get out of the car which i would have too if i had the gun but then not the wherewithal  to fucking keep his wits and not know if the guy's sneaking up behind him there's something  about that that bothers me it's the this the fact that he wound up on his back when he should have  been so fucking aware of his surroundings pursuing a guy following a guy at night who he thinks is  potentially dangerous and yet he winds up getting blindsided walking back to the car not that far away 
[02:21:30]  people get the jump on cops sometimes people get the jump on police officers uh that do have all  that training they do it happens it does it does absolutely happen yeah and it certainly in this  case looks like that's what happened i just have more faith in a cop's ability to analyze that  situation hope so with all the training uh yeah but him and a cop if him and a cop are going to have  the exact same weapon which has the exact same ability then they should have at least the same 
[02:22:00]  training and using that weapon not at all no or the or the same uh i mean i mean he has a permit to  carry yeah it's not like he's just he's got a permit to carry outdoors you know what i mean i'm not  talking about a homeowner having a gun yeah i'm talking about if you have a permit to carry concealed  weapon a concealed weapon you should have a a a obviously a maybe not a higher level of training  than he had because the fact that this happened proves to me there's a flaw there's something 
[02:22:30]  missing because it's very rare that that this stuff happens okay i'm not saying it happens every day  very rare and i'm not saying that you know it's a reflection on all gun owners i'm talking about this  guy specifically and i and and the way he reacted with his gun is is absolutely the way you should  react you don't pull it out you don't use it you don't shoot it in the leg you don't do anything  and until you deem your life is about to be snuffed out then you pull your weapon out and use it to 
[02:23:00]  dispatch the problem and it's exactly what he did and had these guys just had a random confrontation  coming out of the store or seven where there's no way he could have had a you know i better be careful  here i'd be a hundred percent with you but the fact is zimmerman instigated this because he saw  the guy no i don't see the reality i know but the reality is if zimmerman did not notice trayvon martin  walking through that neighborhood who really was doing nothing wrong like again with fat nick hitting 
[02:23:30]  those guys at bats fuck those guys they were there to rob cars fat nick was right zimmerman was  incorrect he made an incorrect judgment on this guy so so you think when cops are driving around and  they see suspicious group of uh people that they shouldn't check that out no i understand and when  they drive off and and no one was doing anything wrong and they do drive away and leave them where  they were you you see that as wrong no i but i think that their their judgment on those individuals 
[02:24:00]  at that moment was incorrect of course it was right if you stop somebody on suspicion and they're not  doing anything you're wrong right okay so yeah so they are wrong a lot but again as long as the cops  are respectful as long as the cops handle it like you know and treat people with dignity or whatever  i don't seem like like george zimmerman was being disrespectful um in in following somebody that fit  the profile i'm talking about but again i'm only saying that zimmerman instigate i'm not saying 
[02:24:30]  disrespectful i'm only saying why i'm okay with the cops doing it the zimmerman was being was  profiling him and in this case zimmerman was wrong he was a hundred percent wrong he thought this guy  was there to do something this guy was not there to do that he's either right or he's wrong he's wrong  so he incorrectly profiles a guy um call the police though he didn't yes he didn't uh he does go after  him to tackle him and cuff him i know but he was wrong he profiled so he did instigate this 
[02:25:00]  because let's just say he looks at trayvon martin and does nothing trayvon martin does not rob a house  right he goes i guess i think he was going back from the store right to his he watches the rest of  the game none of this ever happens right so we do understand that zimmerman and someone could call up  and go how do you know he wouldn't rob but then you're just getting into a semantic so i think we can  all reasonably assume he was not there he didn't have burglary tools on him he didn't right right  okay so uh zimmerman was wrong and zimmerman incorrectly profiled and again i understand 
[02:25:30]  why you profile but if you're going to take profiling to that degree where you get out of  the car and follow a guy then you better be qualified to diffuse a situation you better be ready  you know again if he was sitting in his car with his gun and fucking trayvon reached in and grabbed him  yeah i would have no problem with him shooting trayvon in the fucking head but there there didn't  seem to have been any confrontation discussion um way for him to handle a confrontation like that 
[02:26:00]  it seems like like they never got to even say a word to each other before trayvon was on top of  but didn't didn't trayvon martin's girlfriend say he was on the phone and he's going like yeah this  guy is look at like trayvon is looking at zimmerman looking at him and talking on the phone  that's more testimony that's up for grabs okay i'm just asking i heard that but what what exactly  because i i don't think zimmerman i think he was aware that trayvon martin was aware of him 
[02:26:30]  like if you're following a guy's stealth and right right you don't think that guy knows there's a great  difference in the way you're going to carry yourself oh i absolutely if you know that guy is aware  and upset that you're following trayvon knew that that he was being followed but did zimmerman know  that trayvon knew it i think he did because he was saying you know oh he's he's walking around he's  oh he took off like he then zimmerman's guard then the fact that zimmerman's guard was so fucking down 
[02:27:00]  a moment later is where my problem with him is but you're blaming the guy that started getting the  shit punched out of him and his head banged on the ground for doing nothing more than than keeping  an eye on someone and calling the cops i'm blaming the guy who incorrectly profiled somebody  in hindsight it's incorrect in hindsight but it's again he didn't know at the time that's a high  stakes game to play when you got a fucking pistol and if you're going to follow somebody that implies 
[02:27:30]  that you had better be ready to do something if you confront that person because you're following  somebody that's an action that's not i made a phone call from my house or i made a phone call from  this guard tower or my car and then this guy ran back like a maniac and attacked me you're you're  taking it another level you're following this guy now we only have zimmerman's testimony or or whatever  he said about exactly what set that of course and he may be telling the truth but of course he has to  let's just say for the sake of crazy argument that he's he's fudging a little of course he has to 
[02:28:00]  paint the picture exactly that way so he's not convicted of murder he has to say that like  zimmerman would be an absolute moron if he said uh well uh trayvon kind of approached me and said  what's wrong and then i poked up you know so the way it is painted is a perfect 100 uh crystal clear 
[02:28:30]  picture where zimmerman is the victim and zimmerman is the one telling that story but the stuff  around it makes that harder for me to believe and even if it's true it makes it harder for me to be  empathetic with him because it means he handled himself terribly but it does fit in line with  the limited but other uh witness testimony that there is there you could say like oh he would  have to paint this picture that it was the perfect example of him being the victim when in fact he  doesn't know when he's saying something if somebody when he gave his first um uh testimony to the to 
[02:29:00]  the cops on scene right he didn't know if people were looking out the window and seeing it he's  like oh i better watch what i say because obviously that didn't happen right so you know he would be  taking a pretty big chance fudging it right from the get-go right um and it's very hard to come up a  story right after something happens like that and stick with it it just seems to me that he's being  made the villain in this when in fact if it could have gone the other way and he ended up dead 
[02:29:30]  no one would have known about it no one would have cared and the bottom line is it does seem  to me to be uh but it's hard to paint him as a victim when the other guy's dead the other guy's  dead obviously but the other guy zimmerman was wrong about everything zimmerman was wrong about  everything he was wrong about this guy uh being in the neighborhood to do something he should have  been doing and in hindsight again yeah but hindsight hindsight again hindsight you know i'm money  morning quarterbacking but when you have a pistol on you you had better be fucking ready to be again 
[02:30:00]  it's not like he was defending his own property i get it i would have so much more empathy for him  if this happened on his front yard he lived there so he was just following the guy because he wanted  to play cop and he wasn't qualified to pay cop he wasn't qualified to do that he was and i know cops  get caught off guard but not many cops get caught off guard by a 17 year old who's not that guy  most cops get caught off guard and get their fucking teeth knocked out it's usually by some 
[02:30:30]  guy that's done fucking years it's by a guy who's not afraid of cops it's by a guy who's got a history  of doing that i'm not saying never i'm saying you know in a generalization they usually don't get  caught off guard by some 17 year old who's just going it's just not the type of guy that typically  catches the cops off guard by the way using the age is silly there i could fucking line up 17 year  olds that have done absolutely horrid things but i'm using the age because again there is a  difference between and again a cop whose judgment i trust a lot more sees this face uh and again 
[02:31:00]  somebody who's fucking uh 30 years old i think a cop makes a better snap judgment in that not always  i would hope so but again they have the same weapon so doesn't matter he's a he's an armed citizen  as opposed to a trained police officer right just because you have the same weapon doesn't mean  you have the same training uh now if he decides he wants to be a neighborhood watch guy what is the  criteria in training for neighborhood watch i don't fucking know i don't think there is any 
[02:31:30]  probably i think they appoint you the guy and and that's what it is i know there are some neighborhood  watch uh uh neighborhoods that won't allow their neighborhood watch guys to carry weapons  um i guess just for that reason they don't want to because that's what got him out of the car  well but the weapon is what got zimmerman out of the car perhaps yeah it's absolutely come on you  you know he's not getting out and following that guy without a gun especially if he assumes this guy  might be dangerous he doesn't seem to be a gunslinger kind of guy i'm not saying a gunslinger you know but 
[02:32:00]  again you don't know what someone walks around i'm sure he's a nice guy but bottom line is he wanted  to play cop because he had the safety of that gun he had that he doesn't get out of the car without  that so without the fucking gun he makes that phone call and maybe he loses the guy maybe he  doesn't but because he had the gun he got out of the car so the gun gave him the security to pursue  this guy even on a mild level yeah he turned around and went back but uh if if that's what gives you the  balls then you better be ready or at least aware of your surroundings yeah i mean i don't want to keep 
[02:32:30]  repeating i just can't comprehend being caught so off guard with a gun and knowing that it's it's a  dangerous situation you know what i mean like when you when you walk down 57th street we're going  to xm if you ever happen to have something would you have been so fucking like if there was a guy  you were suspicious of yeah could you picture 30 seconds later blinding yourself and turning  your back on him and just waltzing away without any i mean come on no i i usually have my head on  that swivel yeah because you're you're much more aware maybe you're much more qualified i'm much 
[02:33:00]  more paranoid okay okay but if you're gonna if you're gonna get out of the car because you have  that weapon then you better be that fucking paranoid or that aware you know again i'm not  saying he's a murderer either i don't think he should go to prison for the rest of his life but  i think something has to happen i don't know mistakes were made but again i think the escalation  of physical violence was on trayvon's part i think uh that george zimmerman absolutely felt his life was  in danger in imminent danger at that time and he he used his weapon as anybody should in a self-defense 
[02:33:30]  situation yeah there was a big mistake here yeah i think so jamie fox should have worn a ray charles  shirt last night well jamie fox like i understand why again i didn't start with the the trish one  t-shirt all right that's why i don't mind as much him wearing that shirt i do it's because fucking  you're you're you're setting you're setting up uh uh the public um with your opinion  of of something it it makes zimmerman look guilty before the trial starts but again justice for what 
[02:34:00]  here's what he knows so why doesn't a white guy go and uh wears a shirt for the other side wouldn't  that be amazing if a white guy wore shirts of white people that were victims of black violence but you  could be amazing no you could most people wouldn't know who they were because the press doesn't cover  it the same but i'm saying in the absolute i don't have a problem with jamie fox doing that because  here's what he knows there's a 17 year old unarmed guy walking home who is now dead and you know that 
[02:34:30]  is the reality of what happened and i don't think trayvon was a thug it like that if he was a thug  if he was a fucking chicago gangbanger who got caught without his weapon in a prior dispute with a guy  i would have zero mercy for him so someone should wear zimmerman shirt on the mtv movie yeah try that  yeah you'd look pretty bad but i i wouldn't think you were smart to do that either because i wouldn't  agree with him like you can but is this going to cause a riot in the end yep i think so and where's  the riot going to be let's see what happens florida and uh mostly florida the trial starts this summer 
[02:35:00]  um is he in jail or is he out and he's on he's out okay he's on a bell they know where he is yeah  he he uh the trial starts in this summer um i really i really see an acquittal um poof and and there  will be some angry fucking people yeah i don't know man i don't know i don't know what you like  again and i'm not getting a second degree murder on this guy i think you're right they're not getting  it they probably aren't they probably aren't but there should be some type of oh well they try to 
[02:35:30]  plea the fuck out of this one the prosecution's gonna realize oh my god we fucked up bad all right  we'll try to plead it out to get him some jail time or or or anything and and god i just hope he  sticks to his guns and uh and and takes this right to the end with a jury because i honestly think  this is not a murder too absolutely and i think it's a a good uh self-defense uh case i have a 
[02:36:00]  tremendous again if trayvon had a knife on him doesn't matter but to me i'm just saying as a  person who lives in a society where guns are permitted first by to certain citizens to me it does matter how  people handle that responsibility and i know mistakes are made but when somebody winds up dead  it's it's it's harder for me to accept that a mistake was made because if it was reversed if  this was a white guy walking through a black neighborhood and the same thing happened i'd be 
[02:36:30]  fucking furious at the white victim i'd be and i yeah i know the shirts wouldn't be but fuck the  media i'm only talking about me as a guy yeah i'd be outraged by it and disgusted by it and so like  i should feel the same fucking disgust that this guy was killed when he really wasn't a criminal  who cares what he tweeted do oh no i understand shit and you want an image and to fucking make  girls want to fuck you believe me i'm not saying that uh anything he that's not a reflection of him  as a guy has any bearing on whether he should have been fucking killed or not i'm absolutely not saying  that uh that's more on the media and how you know they they're presenting him as a young innocent 
[02:37:00]  right uh uh black kid and and much younger than he really was much more vulnerable than he really  was and then they present george zimmerman as a white guy uh just a crazy fucking gun flailing  maniac like the same way that again we keep raising the fat nick but he's still in jail  when they show the guy he beat up in his military uniform it's like that guy was there to rob cars  fuck that cocksucker they do that all the time they're repulsive the press is repulsive 
[02:37:30]  yeah but but again you know i think it's i think it's a self-defense case and and i think  when you point out certain things that george zimmerman should have or shouldn't have done with  his gun you're pointing out responsible gun ownership and use in a deadly situation but in  it's just he used it he absolutely waited till the last minute and that's that's fact because of  sure the close proximity he was on top of him yeah when he shot he didn't take a 
[02:38:00]  pot shot at him from 20 feet away or anything like that i don't think he's a murderer that's  why i don't think you should go to jail for the rest of his life but that's when you're supposed  to with the law allows you uh in self-defense to to use a weapon but the gray area is in that  situation when you're the pursuer and you are the instigator and you've made an incorrect  assessment about somebody then you had better be fucking aware of your surroundings i understand if 
[02:38:30]  there's any mistake that was made it's him slipping up and not being aware that he's ready to be  blindsided but that is irrelevant once the violence escalated once trayvon martin escalated to physical  violence you're allowed to follow somebody believe it or not you're allowed you know you can't stalk  someone sure but if you're following somebody you you're allowed to do that without the the threat  that you're going to get your face punched so let's say uh let's say what really happened was 
[02:39:00]  trayvon said what the fuck do you want uh-huh uh stop following me motherfucker and pointed in his  face and then zimmerman when trayvon went to walk away grabbed him because you're not going anywhere  stay right here the cops are coming and let's just say that and then then trayvon punched him  well then the then the violence was escalated by zimmerman that would then have to be thrown into the  the trial and see and proven i know but i mean then but that isn't on the table but but i'm saying  like something like that is a very very you could have a lot of ifs plausible if he grabbed him and 
[02:39:30]  then trayvon uh hit him hit him yeah and but then there's so many hypothetical situations and then  trayvon reaches into his jacket no but that's not and zimmerman goes oh my god i thought he got a gun  and he shot him then again but i'm not even being that dramatic it goes but it goes back and forth  with every escalation i'm saying just one little moment that is not 100% vindicating for zimmerman  i'm i'm saying i'm not painting crazy pictures like you know what if trayvon uh came up and 
[02:40:00]  zimmerman kicked him in the balls i'm not saying anything crazy i'm saying the type of a confrontation  that i would find plausible that could have happened where zimmerman started it could have but i don't  think zimmerman just punched him they ain't gonna fucking they ain't gonna want to hear hypothetical  i know and you can't prove that here's here's the testimony they have here's the eyewitness and  earwitness testimony here's what the cops found at the scene here's what happened um uh here's what  they how they found trayvon all of that where you should have been shot in the stomach or the chest 
[02:40:30]  in the yeah in the chest all of that paints a picture of what happened you can't just take what  zimmerman said it's like oh all we got is what zimmerman said you take that with everything else  and believe it or not the other stuff that might seem oh well nothing's as good as uh  eyewitness testimony or that well yeah but when you take all that other stuff and put it together with  what zimmerman was saying it does give the police and it will give a jury a much better picture than 
[02:41:00]  me and you have sitting here and there's this moment yes and there's nothing that can fill in  that gap yeah whatever happened in that gap right still makes me say his judgment stinks right well  you could absolutely say that and the fact that his judgment stinks uh puts him in some way he's  somehow culpable because when you have a again i keep repeating it but i think when you have that  responsibility of a weapon to carry yeah and you like if a guy if you're home and a guy breaks into 
[02:41:30]  your house right and he's unarmed and you blow his head off with a shotgun well fuck him he loses the  right to fair judgment you know what i mean you're a hundred percent right to kill him in your house i  don't care what he's got or what his intentions are if he's just walking through and he made a mistake  and you kill him you're right but that i think your level of fucking responsibility and culpability goes  up when you have a permit to carry and you're and you're using that permit to carry to give you the 
[02:42:00]  balls to get out of a car and follow someone common sense dictates i think again you can't  prove it in court but you don't get out of that car unless you have the security of a weapon  you he knows he's going to be okay and it turned out that was the right move because that's what  saved him was having that weapon could have been killed sure uh but he wouldn't have gotten out of  that car without that gun and if he's going to have that gun out of that car then he better have  fucking better judgment his judgment and again i know he doesn't have the same training as a cop 
[02:42:30]  but he's man i didn't there shouldn't be that much of a difference in the way you handle uh a  situation if you have a permit to carry a permit to carry is a huge responsibility yeah the the thing  it's very hard to compare a cop with an armed citizen uh actually armed citizens have a lot more  latitude with what they can do with a weapon that a police officer has um but the the officers have  a lot more training uh and a lot more ability to sniff a situation out and i don't think a cop 
[02:43:00]  even though they get caught out there like that guy we saw that that footage that horrible footage  oh yeah yeah the three mexican guys whatever attacking the uh the cop and shooting with his  own gun i know that was terrible it happens and he let his guard down yeah you know but you look at  that and that was in a split second you see how that can happen even to a trained guy you're like  oh god just back up you asshole what are you doing it's so hard to watch yeah you see where he going  wrong yep but uh there's a difference between a snap moment like that and and i just you know 
[02:43:30]  we'll see we'll see in uh we'll see in the summer when uh the trial starts it'll be interesting if he  takes a plea it'll be interesting because his lawyer may go look you know this is what the jury looks  like and they yeah seven white people and five black people uh you know or six two spanish you  may get convicted on and get 15 years in prison or they're offering you five you'll be out in two  and a half what do you take they are going to pressure him because they know what's at stake if  he's acquitted but what does zimmerman do if they agree to put him in a certain kind of jail and keep 
[02:44:00]  him in segregation like what does he do it's a long piece of your life but i think he's going to go for  the go for the jury decision on this one which you know it is taking a chance depending on how  how the jury is composed where you know because he better get up and testify he better fucking  testify if zimmerman i'm telling you that's a that's a good question whether he would or not if anyone in  that situation doesn't testify i don't care what the constitution says you're shit if you're if you're 
[02:44:30]  if you're accused of rape or and you don't testify in your own defense you're shit sometimes  innocent people just don't come off very well i know i know that too i know people just don't  come off well i know testifying in their own defense that looks but no one comes off looking  worse yeah then when you don't want to speak when you guys one of you guys have to admit you're wrong  so you can move on never gonna who's it who's it gonna be no well well you know what i have to  admit you're wrong and then we can move on we'll see there's no real absolute right and wrong 
[02:45:00]  no i we're not gonna get to it of course yeah uh so he wore that shirt huh yeah i thank god there  was at least a lot of laughs at mtv  this is the opiate anthony channel on sirius xm  uh hey ready  i'm hanging on the show with my friend aunt and greg we all of a sudden start to eat eggs we put

[02:50:30]  hour and a half beaver just can't he's just not make it about himself well he's just a stupid  he really is just a stupid kid he's just a dumb fucking kid what is he saying if ann frank was  alive she'd be a believer she would be a believer yeah i think the story was that he wrote in the  guest book or something like that he went to see ann frank's house right and he wrote uh something to 
[02:51:00]  the effect of um i hope you would have been a believer but instead she was hiding from the nazis  yes and then i couldn't make a fucking noise who found her and killed her right but when they found  her he did eric's right there was one less lonely girl yes that's true i like to tie in yeah uh is he  just stupid believer yeah he's i think he or whatever the fuck beaver and the beliebers this is 
[02:51:30]  stupid people here's his quote like he wasn't signing some kid's autograph you know it's like hey how  you doing um he left this message in the ann frank guest book in her house truly inspiring to be able  to come here ann was a great girl hopefully she would have obviously not hopefully hopefully she  would have been a believer that is so hopefully our celebrities are just stupid people they're just 
[02:52:00]  dummies embarrassing he is a dumb kid though i think so it's so odd that he could  not see he was saying something oh hey that's appropriate i what what did i do there in other  celebrity news stupid one of jim orton's pals and he's certainly a friend of the show as well  kevin hart yeah got a little uh got a dui or is it a dewee out there what what's the difference i just  say dewee all the time they're the same thing right yeah it kind of works with both dwi and dui are 
[02:52:30]  both dewee i guess he was going 90 miles an hour he was hammered almost hit a fucking uh tanker truck  he's crazy but he wasn't masturbating at the window that's a different story no it's good  thank god nice to know uh and tmz caught up with him yep and he decided to be honest where they  going he decided to be honest he decided to be honest celebrity yeah it's very rare how you doing  kevin man how you feeling brother oh good yeah what exactly happened dude uh i got arrested for 
[02:53:00]  resisting arrest last night dui uh what else man is that pretty much it what what what preempted it  like you were is it the police report says that you were driving in excess of 90 miles an hour on  the freeway preempted you almost hit a gas tanker is there any truth to that i don't think there's a  gas tanker on the freeway so what truth to that uh no what happened was yesterday i got pulled over  what do you say no definitely not sure got pulled over last night uh gave me the whole test 
[02:53:30]  passed the test officer then gave me the breathalyzer failed the breathalyzer i said look it's fine i'm  drunk i get it do what you gotta do right my girl was with me i said look just make sure she gets  home safe uh with that being said told her well she's got to figure it out i said well that's  weird because my house is up the street i pulled over maybe an exit before mine i said well at least  let her take my car go home what was the resisting arrest part the officer tried to put handcuffs on my 
[02:54:00]  wrist and my watch was here and i said wait let me take my watch off and he said you're resisting  arrest i said stop let me take my watch off you're resisting arrest they didn't threw me down and  oh man i laugh at it though right yeah i know it happens to people dude you know material for  right there you go man i'm sure you'll recover you're gonna be great i was actually  drunk so there's no arguing now well yeah no i feel you brother hey hey take care man all right 
[02:54:30]  people agree more with anthony on twitter in fact jesus oh you're still on that yeah i'm just  looking at it more with anthony yeah a bunch of racists yeah you got your posse a bunch of  goddamn racists certainly got your posse uh you think kevin hart was resisting arrest no i believe  that he was trying to take his watch he's probably had a really expensive watch on that he didn't  want to get scratched up thank god he wasn't walking through a fucking neighborhood or these  people don't think you should be shot  you fucking faggots shut up you fucking fake cop cunts shut your fucking mouths you fucking you 
[02:55:00]  cocksuckers i want to be a cop you're not cops you fucking faggots the fuck up i want to be a tough  you fucking you fucking living room gangsters go fuck yourselves you fucking little pussy boys 
[02:55:30]  you fucking faggots holy shit jimmy's eyes your eyes are scary right now  oh god damn oh is that fucking funny what else did you have on kevin hart you were saying  uh photos of him blowing someone oh wait you mean  what else i have i'm nothing oh no you were saying something 
[02:56:00]  you were saying during the break uh the cop wanted to give him a breathalyzer i guess you said  oh no i was just kind of repeating that where he said he was drunk it was something like that like  but the cop was like was ready to give him a breathalyzer and kevin hart said i could save  you some time right now whatever the quote was yeah the uh yeah the sobriety test i guess that  quote came from tmz finally gave him the breathalyzer uh that that that that's a weird situation with  the him going you know let me get my watch you know that is weird because sometimes it's an expensive 
[02:56:30]  watch though yeah yeah yeah he definitely i'm sure the cop wanted him not to be cool you know  what i mean like he wanted a little action yeah he's pulling over a celebrity that was just going  he's probably already annoyed that kevin hart was going 90 miles an hour because now the cop's like  this could be dangerous to me cop could have been calling just be like i'll watch the watch don't  worry about it you know but he's drunk though too so yeah that might have came across a little  differently like like he probably wasn't polite about it it sounds all good now the day after  i get my fucking watch that's more likely what happened yeah you could probably ask 
[02:57:00]  it's kind of hard to reach for your watch when they're going to cuff you that's probably a bad  decision by kevin yeah he's got it you know be like if it gets scratched i'll get it fixed but  when they're going to put the cuffs on you i think that's pretty much it game over ah yeah there's no  there's no saying can i do this or can i do that where was he where was he coming from a bar  i watched uh have you seen his special seriously funny no i don't watch other comedians no you 
[02:57:30]  weren't asking no why i haven't seen that one yet i'm upset no it's an insulting question why do you  uh ask because i watched it before louis special this weekend it's goddamn hilarious which one's  better put you on the spot well louis was like new which one was better i don't know they were  doesn't want to make a decision i'm not gonna why would i there's no way they're both hilarious 
[02:58:00]  comics they're the two top comedians right these guys just polarized uh people out there let's go  for it polarized who's special is better who do you like better on the show uh louis ck i like better  on the show see how easy that is to do how come he's just he's been on more and uh and see but  that's not his stuff has absolutely been funnier on our show i'll give you an answer but i like  jim norton how about that i saw mccaroline's that's right fucking killed see i just faced you  you you thought you were gonna put me in a tough spot so whose special was better i don't know i 
[02:58:30]  didn't ever probably they were both good i think you want to say kevin hartz was i get the feeling  you want to say that no i don't want to say that because louis was hilarious they were both great  yeah i didn't have i wasn't sitting there going oh you know what you can't figure out which one was  better for your tastes let me see for my for my taste well i'd seen some of louis before because  i saw him at caroline's i know you want to say kevin hart oh man so kevin's i had no expectations 
[02:59:00]  for but i can't say what kind of fucking thing is that to say about kevin really i can't say one  they're both hilarious yeah was he loaded was he loaded up there on stage they're both in the  hilarious category so this is okay to answer whose special was better for you i will tell you  louis was much better on snl than kevin was oh see he wants to see where he's going hot i see where  he's going but i don't know who's special they're both very well done i read between the lines it's 
[02:59:30]  okay you know all right let's do like this who had more white people at their special  who was more attractive during their special i mean kevin who was better dressed during their  special kevin who had a bigger gut during their special louis who was a red-haired cunt during  their special who said more nice things during their special kevin who said shittier things during  their special louis who is probably going to get more shit for certain things they said during the  special louis who likes to drink and drive more kevin  i thought louis ck special was terrific i loved it i did not see kevin hart's latest he also had 
[03:00:00]  lebron james standing up in the middle of the audience she's like throwing his hat because he  was you know made just like you know grabbing his face and throwing his hat in the air really yeah  yeah louis had what some of his drink spilled on his shirt that was funny well that spilled his water  on his shirt he's like he's just a regular guy that louis ck did he really spill water on his  shirt that fucking clod he had it and he left it he left it in the special that's great and you know 
[03:00:30]  they tape too so he could easily you know decide that out but that's louis i wish he was fucking  scalding tea or she fucking burned his mexican nipple off in the middle of the special that's the  joke that's got him in that's the start of the joke that's got him in hot water with yeah i know  we're hot water with bloggers yeah there's a blogger man at uh louis ck yeah why do we why  do we it's not news but why don't we even have this in front of us like how just because just  because we want to show that bloggers are cunts i love jimmy talking about the blogger in your act

[03:04:30]  he was making who cares right that's what you say that's a funny joke who cares if it was a gay guy  exactly exactly maybe to this fucking stupid cunt blogger maybe because you don't understand because  you're probably not a comic you're just a jerk off who sits at home wannabe you're like the fucking  you're like george zimmerman with a keyboard but not you you're one of these guys who thinks he  understands the process maybe louis girl whatever she is she's a father then you're then cunt was 
[03:05:00]  right yeah maybe louis spilled water on himself because louis is a clumsy jizz bag and decided how  do i get from this moment into that next moment and as a comic you make that snap decision oh goodness  because you know you want to get into that bed this is not a gay voice by the way you know i live in  this place and i'm going into here with all these maybe that's how he just segued in a weird moment  like quotes in here you know she brought up his tweet when he said about tracy morgan tracy morgan  said something wrong evil cruel ignorant and hilarious he was on a comedy stage not a pulpit 
[03:05:30]  yeah louis on tracy morgan right so she's actually just giving louis a great quote there well she said  he appears to have doubled down on that quote it doesn't count unless it's from a pulpit defense  with this terribly offensive remark implying pedophiles are gay men oh boy what a offensive  to who what i mean look she's got the right to write that but what what if that's everything  our country is yes is little fucking babies looking for reasons to be upset by things performers 
[03:06:00]  stop going after stand-ups and now believe me you're not getting an apology out of louis and now  they have a voice of course they have a little blog what does she look like let's see what she looks  like she writes as a longtime fan of ck's work including his hit fx sitcom louis i eagerly turned  tuned in oh you're not a fan then i guess if she's a fan of ck's uh then i guess she didn't like when  he said nigger didn't he say nigger toes about fucking my nigger toes wow i guess this girl approves 
[03:06:30]  of the word nigger but doesn't approve of that joke what a fucking racist this bitch is that backhanded  shit she's not a fan to begin with no i believe her she's a fan and i believe she's a racist because  she was not offended by the word nigger she's trying to make her point stronger by saying she's  a fan she absolutely is not a fucking racist i eagerly tuned in only to be profoundly disappointed  by what appears to be a slur against gay men well you know what she didn't mind the word nigger so i  say i don't know what her name is but she sounds like a racist to me right i think she should be 
[03:07:00]  charged with racism i think that publicly because she did not object to louis saying nigger she objected to  this that she's a fucking she hates black people oh god i believe this is absolutely look at her we  ought to just fucking we ought to take her to task for hating black people that's not right what was  her name when she was a man whoa was she a man i don't know i gotta see the body shot i can't see  much of an adam's apple my hair's in the way maybe she was a man something's not right there 
[03:07:30]  i'm not a fan of louis ck shut up one should just fucking be brave and say you you were never a fan of  his uh type of humor i love his don't fucking lie that's that's a liar right there but she's just  saying like that she was offended selectively by this joke right it's like if you're able to look  at louis this is why she's hateable if you're able to understand the absurdity of some of what he says  and yet you look at this literally then you're a dumb cunt yeah right why take one thing literally 
[03:08:00]  so how do you claim to be a fan of louis when he's absurdist with half the shit he says right and he  says things that are over the top and ridiculous and that's what he does for a living yeah and yet  this you choose to take literally what a dumb fucking bitch what a dummy they're fucking hateable  aren't they just hateable and i guess blogging is almost a good thing because we can see how dumb  our fellow countrymen that's true well she gave a suggestion on his comedy oh good what's that  what's the suggestion she writes how is this acceptable where's the joke repeated studies have 
[03:08:30]  shown there is no proven correlation between gay men and pedophilia studies when imitating a  pedophile who loves creating statues of little boys why not use a creepy even baritone voice instead  because that's good louis did the joke the way he did the joke and the fact if he would have done  the baritone because your outrage is fraudulent and it's manufactured somebody would have found a  problem with that so no matter what because you're acting like you're justified in your offense 
[03:09:00]  you want to be offended so you're upset you're not justified what's her credentials uh to give him  suggestions on what works in comedy give him give suggestions credentials that you know this shit  better than louis ck shut the fuck up if you want to suggest something suggest how to be an  inconsistent shithead i have uh i have giantism i'm very offended that louis ck was saying giants are  pedophiles in the article is a great louis ck tweet by the way uh he tweeted uh a while ago tracy 
[03:09:30]  morgan said something wrong evil cruel ignorant and hilarious he was on a comedy stage not at a pulpit  mm-hmm i'm just saying it's brilliant and that's all you need to know about comedy comedy relax  yeah all right all right and then she brings up all his you know sarah palin tweets that he tweeted  and then deleted remember that controversy what does that have to do with this situation yeah well  rather than apologize for the palin remarks ck instead simply pulled out of his gig uh few days 
[03:10:00]  after greta van susten whatever and said he just didn't want to do it anymore you know about the  associate boy for a fan of louis she really turned on louis no kidding this cunt really turned on louis  fast when she didn't like one joke what a fan of comedy what a great comedy fan this fucking long  neck attractive young lady is you like her oh she's terrific what a great comedy fan love the guy's 
[03:10:30]  work and he does a joke you object to and all of a sudden you're outraged what's her deal like  cares what she thinks why why does that matter so much to somebody like one instance where it's like  oh he used a stereotypical gay voice what he was doing like why would she she was that i think  her outrage is fake but i think you guys are missing the bigger point the media i cares enough to put  this on their front page today yeah that's ridiculous stir shit up but why yeah because 
[03:11:00]  all these stupid blogger blog and let it just disappear but then you put it on a site like  media that gives it some heat all these sites she's not getting a lot of support on the comments  one guy thank god she's not you've got it all wrong aj louis ck was stereotyping all sculptors as men  it was really a sexist barb that assumes women can't sculpt and once women hear about it they're  going to be pissed that's a good one another person writes uh thanks again aj for the clips  your articles and ideas are preposterous but i was waiting to see some of this hey there you go 
[03:11:30]  nice yeah just again she has the right to write it and you know you're allowed to put your opinions  out there of course there's nothing wrong with that but it's just it's just a symbol of how  fucking stupid people are but did media i uh comment on this article at all or they just threw it out  there what do you mean it's her she works for media oh that's why yeah jesus she's her editor at  media i why wouldn't she be yuck know what the pictures are just that huh what's her twitter just

[03:15:00]  it i just got had so bad i'm just eating up i feel so uncomfortable there's a location here i mean  they don't have it seems logical that it could have happened right happen you're with me right i know  that they why not i think guys have had fucking kids after they've been dead i nine years after  they've been dead yeah why not what is she keeping his common like a come safe or something i don't  think it's the jizz i think they fertilize an egg do that in vitro shit and then for and then they  freeze the fertilized egg they freeze that shit for a while and then you could take that and implant 
[03:15:30]  it no you keep the cum in your cheek for nine years like chaw like some chaw between your cheek and gum  come on who knows this shit i think you just take some old sperm that's been frozen for a while  and then you could fucking because i don't think sperm freezes very well i think uh how do they  handle it in sperm banks just drink it oh i think i'm drinking jokes am i gonna do sorry i i think  i think in sperm banks uh they don't keep it for like nine years well how long i don't know what's 
[03:16:00]  the shelf life on some sperm what's the what's the oh dr steve uh well spermatozoa  and i was gonna go with the hot teacher story i fucking blew it that was gonna be that was gonna be  my uh big comeback on today's show i got a bed got a bed i'm hearing this uh another teacher having  sex with a lot of students at a school and i'm hearing she's pretty hot a queen's teacher who  was arrested and fired for taking a 16 year old student to a hot sheets a hot sheets motel what 
[03:16:30]  is that a term for those uh no tell motel is that a term for those fucking hourly places hot sheets  motel for a videotaped romp also violated two other boys inside her school violated uh  tara's 35 and the boys are 15 or 16 oh boy video wow she's this video yeah oh how hot  lucky bad having sex with a minor picture well it's his job she's all right they're saying she's a 
[03:17:00]  hot teacher she's a mom the student she's a fucking nine well if you're 15 that's a nine or a ten yes  but we're older gentlemen you take the hair more picky take the hair off of her come on look  it's a dude she's not that hot they're calling her hot because obviously that makes for a better  story she brazenly had sex with two other students at the school where her serial shenanigans were  uncovered by girlfriends of the teacher's pets they've uh all right now hold on a minute 
[03:17:30]  what this is obviously photoshopped yeah i can't hope what the fuck is going on  there's no i mean it's not even the same skin tone my head  i had a long weekend i'm disciplining my kid i'm tired anybody's got links to share with obi today  today is the day to do it oh jesus no i'm i'm on twitter i'm not even gonna attempt to go on there  look it's a guy taking a picture on top of the world trade center there's an airplane i've seen 
[03:18:00]  that one all right i knew that guy like did you fuck yeah i think i'll probably get you with that  civil war civil war hero picture again that was just miniatures oh the miniatures yeah that one  i gave my kid 10 10 timeouts in a row so how long he's kicking punching and  fucking hitting my throat with those chops and you gave him timeouts for that over and over again 
[03:18:30]  you so understand why parents have hit their kids so he knows he's like okay i'll take the time out  i'll do my time and then i'll do my time it'll be like five minute time out and then i'll go back  and punch him in the throat it's always wrong to spank somebody like that i don't know what to do  i really don't know what to do is it wrong to grab somebody's arm hard and smack him on the ass you  so get why our parents did what they did to us to a point because i don't know but these new rules  my kid goes oh he just thinks it's part of his day now to have a time out he goes oh over here and 
[03:19:00]  he smiles walks over just sits there it's a little rest for him and then we then we're uh we put him  up in his you know in in a high chair and and strap him in for a while and then we realize he's he's  looking just at a beautiful view of midtown manhattan i'm like wow that's a tough time out  can you lock him in a room or something for like 20 minutes i kind of want to put him in a  a less desirable place in the you should in the in the apartment make him watch like laverne and  shirley a couple of extra foot pounds of pressure per second per second can you throw a kid in a 
[03:19:30]  closet i don't know i need to know what the new rules are got me in trouble years ago so have i  put the closet i need to know what the new rules are you know and then you realize if i you know i  could raise an asshole i don't want to raise an asshole no put him out there in society but you  realize why other people just decide to raise assholes it's less work yeah it's easy to raise an  asshole it's so easy to raise a fucking asshole both of your fathers are proof of that 
[03:20:00]  so fucking easy fuck you gotta work at not making them assholes huh but those fucking throat shots  are not fun but he just knows five minute timeout we gotta give him timeout for like an hour yeah  well yeah well there is a theory that you only give him a timeout depending on how old he is  i just so don't believe what there's a formula so let's say my kid's almost three so they're 
[03:20:30]  the timeouts are supposed to be three minutes that does nothing out of here i'd be punching  people in the throat all day if all i had to do that's three minutes i could do that stand on my  head yeah i did my three minutes yeah it's nothing but i got out after three minutes i need to get  what's mine i did 10 in a row and by the eighth or ninth he was getting it he was not happy i'm like  see this is working yeah that's what you gotta do timeouts all day long oh i say a 16 hour timeout  yeah he has to hold nails show that boy who's boss can you take stuff away from him like can't 
[03:21:00]  you take away his toys or his trampoline or something he's a lucky kid he's got so many  toys he doesn't even notice that they're gone take all of them away yeah you're not playing with  any of your toys you're gonna sit there and i will confess that you know sometimes i want to check  my numbers so i leave him in the timeout a little longer with the numbers so i leave him in timeout a  little longer so it doesn't bother me when i'm checking my numbers that's that's that's abuse  hey if he's gonna abuse me with neck chops i'm gonna fucking check my numbers and he's gonna  sit there a couple extra minutes here's what you gotta do and candy crush has taken up a lot of my 
[03:21:30]  time these days you're sitting there stretching your neck leaving it wide open level 50 you rock  i'm getting there i'm catching you you got you gotta get uh you gotta get that uh triangle like  angle molding right and then you put it on the floor and you make them kneel on it and then you  have them hold two paint cans straight out uh ow that would hurt it's like a torture  imagine having to you know someone did that like molding i i just saw it in some movie years ago  what movie uh i forgot what it was no i know this having to kneel on oh that would hurt i don't know 
[03:22:00]  i don't know what's i don't know paint cans i have no idea what you're supposed to do i have no idea  timeouts are a joke you gotta throw them in a closet for like an hour stop saying closet  closet closet you gotta throw them in a closet closet a closet closet there's no aw in there  it's not closet closet exactly what are you fucking santa or something fucking cat does to  the couch i said that you piece of garbage no i said it i said it better fuck that know what gets 
[03:22:30]  me the most what i have almost bit my lip off he'll look at me and go how dare you  what he's gonna be a little asshole how dare you he's three what would you say that would make  him say that i don't nothing nothing of he probably said click this link it's from a listener  nothing bad you know maybe uh you know pick up your toys pick up this okay yeah toy thing you  were playing with yeah because we're trying to teach him to clean up after himself a little bit too 
[03:23:00]  so that so the apartment doesn't look like a fucking hurricane hit it and he says how dare you  like i'm gonna fucking bite my lip off hilarious you tell him not to talk back you yell at him and  this three-year-old head you know he doesn't care how dare you last night he goes what did i do wrong  this time oh wow i think you're gonna have a little asshole oh man every day i can't wait oh shut up dad 
[03:23:30]  oh god dad shut up how dare you oh he's like five years in front of everybody hey dad why don't you  shut up shut up dad no  that's that's funny as fuck good for you kid give him a dollar say how dare you  that'd be the worst too all of his friends will be over just laughing at the kid  encouraging him  wait what did he rock he did that to you at our house he said how dare you he kept uh putting little 
[03:24:00]  toys on the train track and you picked them up and i said and you said stop touching the trains  and he you put them down he just had this look on his face and he went how dare you  that's great now all of hope's friends in front of the kids just say how dare you  and laugh and clap when he says  and he says oh my god too oh my god he's like like exasperated oh yeah yeah like i can't believe  you're putting me through this yeah i kind of i kind of laugh a little bit of course you do that's 
[03:24:30]  why he's gonna be a little asshole let's say hi to dr steve steve how long can you keep sperm  oh indefinitely in your mustache well i got i got fucked over on a fake story you had tony  randall who died nine years ago and the story uh stated that they used his sperm and uh the lady  gave birth to twins nine years later after his death is that possible even though it's a fake  story there's potentially no practical limit to the length of time sperm can remain frozen 
[03:25:00]  it's in liquid nitrogen so they they don't know how long it it will last so about 50 percent of  the sperm will live after you saw it i don't understand uh how a living thing yep can survive  being frozen for that long with how does that work dr steve well it's how about this the probiotics  probiotics that you buy that have uh nine about amateur biotics uh bacterial 
[03:25:30]  yikes um uh those things are freeze-dried and you add water to them and they come back to life that's  how stupidly simple bacteria are that's fucked up so um yeah sperm are single cells and uh  organism is even stretching it but you know they are motile human cells and uh they're very  simple in that regard although you know on a molecular level if you but you know if you looked 
[03:26:00]  at them with a x-ray uh microscope which i have we all have of course we all have what do you think  i got one of those in my mouth but they'll uh uh they're very simple in that regard and you can  freeze them and they just come back to life i mean it's just a it's a bag with dna and some very  simple uh molecular machine that's a scrotum you just described so what if it has like i don't know 
[03:26:30]  freezer burn yeah well that's why only half of them live uh the the trick with liquid nitrogen is  the rapid freezing uh and you do this uh without uh making ice crystals because it's the ice crystals  that would destroy the cells right dr steve i'm a i'm a huge get in the hughes clan so i should uh i  should start freezing all my sperm for future fucking generations right absolutely why why wouldn't you  do that absolutely for future generations so anyone in the hughes clan could get a fucking uh diamond 
[03:27:00]  exactly now what about what makes you such a huge get i'm a you haven't met my extended family trust  me sam roberts i'm a huge get in the hughes clan dr steve there's only been a few of us that have  been successful over the years what about the eggs yeah what about the eggs can they be frozen too  yeah sure they can and you can freeze embryos too yeah what how long does it take steve you said a  rapid freeze what's a rapid freeze oh it it happens in less than a second when they drop it in the 
[03:27:30]  liquid nitrogen really liquid nitrogen is cold so if i fell in liquid nitrogen would i die instantly  no thanks as a matter of fact um you can dip and don't do this i'm just at home if you have access  to liquid nitrogen but you there is uh enough heat given off by your body that will gasify  liquid nitrogen uh just for a brief second so you could dip your hand into liquid nitrogen right 
[03:28:00]  bring it back out again and it would be okay because that the gas that is produced when the  liquid nitrogen turns to gas the liquid never actually late your hand yeah the liquid never  actually touches your finger for that for that instant very brief how about if you left it in there  for like six hours or something oh boy terrible question hey steve question yes so is there uh any  cases on record where you know a lady had a kid many many years uh past the fact their uh husband 
[03:28:30]  there was dead or whatever i'm not aware of any specifics but there's no i would love to know like  how is there a lady out there that i don't know they passed it on to another generation or something  and finally you decide you someone's sperm to have kids can you find that out for maybe tomorrow  that'd be fascinating i did i did hear about a case where there was uh frozen embryos uh and the  woman wanted to use them and the the man was dead and uh there was some big court case i guess his 
[03:29:00]  family had um said no and they probably want to split the money yeah yeah and these embryos are just  sitting there frozen there was that case of a guy that was brain dead and his wife came out job at the  board of the opian anthony show oh yeah exactly 
[03:29:30]  hey we should play words back guess who's dame bread go ahead go okay but there's the uh  and uh masturbated this guy which and was able to achieve an ejaculation because  it well it shows two things that even brain dead guys are really horny direction right and uh  but she was able to uh collect a sperm sample under those circumstances and have herself 
[03:30:00]  inseminated with it wow you know i don't give a fuck after i'm gone i don't care what the fuck  they do with my sperm yeah fucking smear it around if you want yeah smear it on windows i don't give  a fuck it around i don't give a crap how dare you how dare you hey y'all what on your uh with your  kid oh yeah you were talking about uh uh discipline i love the time out technique but  you've got to put him in a little chair in the most boring corner of the apartment that's what i  do okay okay well you were saying that right next to my pablo picasso there's no boring places in 
[03:30:30]  my apartment that's the problem yeah in the hallway facing the door i like that idea yeah  you still watch no it's right near the front door the little corner there we use or just right  in front of the closet or something like that just it has to be a boring place where he can't  see and do you agree that a three-year-old should only be in time out for three minutes  holy fuck no one gives a fuck about this listen that's a rule of thumb to get you in the ballpark  some kids need longer some can do better can do okay with less so you just got to see your kid 
[03:31:00]  is it okay to leave him in there a little extra longer to maybe do something for your own benefit  like check your numbers or your twitter or play a little candy crush all right  i have a question too dr steve unrelated time out for your own fucking sanity yeah good hour and a  half yeah do you want to watch apocalypse now there's not a parent there's not a parent listening  now that hasn't done that one that trick a little extra i could get i could get a little fucking test  done right now steve you know i'm not lying i know you're not lying man you're with me i know 
[03:31:30]  absolutely all right dr steve do you know when i started taking nexium off the because i'm wondering  if that contributes to my sleep apnea i don't remember when you started it um you know reflux  certainly is one of those things that can affect your sleep i don't know that it's that it would  be a cause of your sleep well they said the nexium itself might be a problem who said that i read that  somewhere that there's something where it could it could change your breathing and i'm i'm wondering  if it coincides timing wise if we could just check back to when i started taking yeah i can do that 
[03:32:00]  i'll do that off the air okay thank you and i'll uh i'll also look up that if if there is a  connection between the two it's something i haven't heard of and uh you know i'll check into it  absolutely well that's the way we work a lot of times i give steve uh steve some medical theories  and he goes and checks them out that's great i'm good all right steve thanks for another mediocre  appearance i really appreciate it we're in medicine saturday night at 9 p.m smoking and cancer  and links i want to talk about next because i'm suspicious i think they exist oh i am i'm a big fan 
[03:32:30]  of the weird medicine when is it on again uh saturday night i know but you got to tell the  people right all right and of course on riot cast you got the weird medicine podcast  and uh 9 a.m that's right all right appreciate it guys all right buddy all right steve the good  doctor steve speaking of smoking and cancer they got a brutal i tweet about a little bit over the  weekend oh yeah they got a brutal one cancer fucking ad they're playing a shitload and it was during that  amazing hockey game the islanders and rangers for hockey fans it was a great fucking game 
[03:33:00]  my team lost in overtime unfortunately one zip um but every stoppage of play they went with this  fucking brutal commercial this guy suffering lung cancer in front of his bathroom window with a mirror  excuse me just hacking up everything in sight ah horrible i don't understand why we have to sit  through that shit we should i like it though we should do like it yes i i know that shit's  happening yeah i don't like we should really know it i mean you because what happens is we don't have 
[03:33:30]  but how many people is that really hitting and then the rest of us have to suffer through that shit  it's it hits a lot of because they're talking about the people that get it because they're smoking  but it's also to discourage people who might smoke which is everybody um it's like we for so many  years you hear these things the guy causes cancer but then you see what a lung looks like it's like  oh my fuck like ah what is cancer it's this intangible thing that won't happen to me but then you see  a real lung like remember when that guy brought that fucking in yeah dude that was horrible to feel 
[03:34:00]  a cancer like that like i wish everybody had the chance to feel a fucking but during a great hockey  game when you're all up and excited yeah it just keeps bringing down your emotions  fuck and there was no humor in it like the the people with the hole in their throat  at least you can have a little fun with those commercials comment you see the other one with  the lady who has the plastic in her neck it has to pop in order for her to breathe and talk  i've seen that one i put on my wig then i put in my teeth now i'm ready to go out she puts a scarf

[03:35:30]  like it's time for me to greet the world you remember emmy was on a couple weeks ago i saw you uh  on i went on thursday to see jim and you opened for him and i went to see i went over to my parents  house over the weekend because then they were there too right i don't know did you meet my parents i met  your parents it's crazy because you and your brother have the exact same hair and then your dad just has  almost no hair which is right right it's not it's like where do you get it from something happened 
[03:36:00]  i don't exactly know i'm surprised my dad doesn't have more questions about that yeah you're half  jamaican yeah yeah you're jamaican in the haircut this isn't right but uh my mom goes she goes oh  and that who was that that chris that came out i was like yeah chris stefano oh he was so funny and  and you know why he was great and i go you explain to me mom you're the comedy expert now you went to  a comedy show she's never seen any stand-up before and she goes you know why he was great  especially for that audience why i go why mom why because he was smart and he was local and he 
[03:36:30]  mentioned the roads and everything that was really funny that's the only thing nothing else so what the  roads you mean oh like in in the city area yeah right so like the fact that you mentioned highways  by name oh really put my mom over the map on that like that was it right well you know have your mom  know that if i go to the new england area i change those to new england through way you do if i go  west coast i change it to a pacific coast highway yeah like i hate to tell you mom but he just kind 
[03:37:00]  of looks at street signs of whatever town he's in yeah that's what it is sorry 95 is an easy one  yeah because it's like across the east coast i got that on all all the east coast states yeah you  guys been on 95 yeah boom figured yeah you're in nebraska no what's up god damn it shit well route 66  right yeah you could do route 66 most places well i appreciate your mom you know thinking about me  over the weekend and you know having a reason why she thinks i'm funny i appreciate that most people 
[03:37:30]  say oh we like him because he makes fun of his haircut and he knows he looks like a douchebag so we're  happy that he said it because we know he's an asshole we like that he makes fun of himself because  we would have done it yeah because you know we really don't like him yeah yeah he's not a great  guy he rubs me the wrong he looks like a dick but he's funny yeah because he said it that's yeah  that's what i that's what like the the thing i hear about all the time like oh you know we didn't  really like you until you made fun of your haircut and you established that you do look like a douchebag  i said when you came on the stage i don't like him that's what people say i said that to my husband 
[03:38:00]  i don't like him you're not you're you know you feel like some of the audience doesn't feel like  you're a likable likable guy but that's why i feel like with the type of hairstyle and what i look like i need to be  like look i know i look like this okay i've established that now can you just listen to me  i've written some jokes but i've written i wrote some i wrote some jokes romantically they're not  great yeah listen uh but do you feel like because you have a haircut and you google him if you don't  know chris it's spelled like di stefano but it's di stefano no but it's di stefano but it said di  stefano you spelled my name wrong somebody spelled my name wrong downstairs and the people like yo we 
[03:38:30]  can't let you win i was like well it's just that they probably spelled the d-e and it's di and they're  like oh yeah you're right you're right my fault yo there's no way it could have been a typo  yeah yeah it's de stefano d-i-s-t-e-f-a-n-o i gotta actually think of maybe i should do like some type  of bit about that because everybody always spells my name wrong they're like i can't find you i'm  looking for you on facebook and twitter i'm like well did you are you doing d-e and they're like yeah  well it's di what's your twitter at chris d comedy see that's smart that's a thank you i appreciate 
[03:39:00]  that you just throw the d on it nobody's got to figure out how to spell this name it's not yeah  uh colby in ireland in ireland yeah what's up prime time how are you i'm good how are you i'm  great what are you doing in ireland uh living here pretty much great well how'd you what are you  doing listening to this in ireland well you know i i've never heard of obi and asni but i just  choose into the shit show because i'm a big fan nice so it's just you're just an after show guy  there's a lot of those guys are you chris de stefano guy um well no not at all well fuck you 
[03:39:30]  then yeah you fucking asshole it's the haircut isn't it what's going on not much i was going  to ask for that uh visitor pass okay i'm going to put you on hold and we'll send you opi's visitor  pass great thanks nope he gives him i think i don't know if he does it because it makes him feel  like a little bigger but he likes to take things and sign them and then tell me to give them away  all right on the after show so this is he forgot his id so just like you he's got a little visitor 
[03:40:00]  pass that he signed and he said i could give that away they have to have visitor passes opi and anthony  yeah yeah if they don't have a little id card to scan this what the fuck one of us has to put them  in the system and be like and they have to present identification same way you did really and if they  don't say if they spell opi with a y instead of an ie they go no no no really i thought they could just  walk in how do they no no no they don't know they don't have that deal i think howard's the 
[03:40:30]  only one with that they can do that yeah well i would think opi and anthony could too he rides up  the freight elevator but all right your your haircut let's get back to it yeah i mean i think because  it wore you look like a guy who's on television i mean guys on television have that haircut is that  way but you understand that it's like a douchey frat boy haircut okay i'll be honest with people okay  because comics are always like oh you only get that haircut for your opening joke okay maybe  look okay because it's a nice icebreaker right but no i'm comfortable here's the truth all right 
[03:41:00]  i used to get a different type of haircut more low haircut i have just on the left side a bit of a  receding hairline okay so when i have my hair like that it kind of looks like i just have like a shit  streak going around my head it looks like somebody you know like when like the the you go to like the  ghetto barbershop and they zeke you and they put like that little part in your hair right they put  like especially they did in the 90s all the time that fake little swoosh yeah i have like a you  know gary coleman i have a lower east side gang member 1990s you know spanish haircut swoosh and i 
[03:41:30]  keep checking my head and so but when i grow my hair out it doesn't seem to do that and i can just  douche it up and faux honking up and i'm comfortable but i am exploring i would like to explore a new  haircut how long have you had the the phone chris has a faux hawk that's what it is and  like you said it's something that you you get on the stage you're aware people are judging you for  it right um and it's something that you address in your comedy right which again if you got a new 
[03:42:00]  haircut you gotta write a new joke and it's like oh fuck well and you know in in i gotta go back i  gotta do more material about roads exactly and it's like how many fucking streets can i make fun of  there's only so many streets but so i will be honest though i used to have the same bit when i had a  different haircut but it would be about my bone structure i know i have douchebag bone structure  okay so i do kind of i was exploring that i knew that i was a douchebag from when i the first time  looked in the mirror when i was about two years old it's not the haircut yeah you're i was a baby 
[03:42:30]  douchebag so it's not so much the haircut but the haircut does make an easier platform to leap off  of if you will for the douchebag jokes but because people are not sitting there going because people  might have been sitting there going well i really wasn't paying attention to his bone structure it's  kind of a reach to start the conversation on bone structure well i used to be locked into the joke  where i would i would only open with that but now what i do is i try there was no sense of  spontaneity on stage like i have my three minutes and that's what i do and that's what i'm gonna do  but now what i do is i try to do some other bits i talk about the roads talk about my fear of deers 
[03:43:00]  and wildlife and then if people aren't laughing i go look i know i got a douchebag heck and then they go  oh okay he knows you go back to that three yeah i go back to that three minute thing yeah but uh because  before because you said what you're just driving along going like i got my douchebag haircut thing  you know these fucking roads are pretty hilarious what you think about yeah and then i got well  like i think like most comics i mean you know i am still relatively new i'm only i'm not even four  years in i'm almost four years in wow so you know there's only so much material i can do i mean 
[03:43:30]  i did like a 55 minute set the other night but a lot of it was reaching into bullshit so a guy who's  been doing it for a long time a great comic like jim norton can probably open with an array of  different things because he's had so he has so many jokes that crush i only have so i have you  know uh maybe 10 that crush and the rest of them it's like okay they go either way so you know i'm  taking a risk but that's the only way to grow is to try to do the new material so are you good at  making fun of people uh you know i'm i do i can heckle i mean i you know if you heckle me i can 
[03:44:00]  hold my own just because like you know being like an italian from but that's what i was gonna say  like when you're a kid are you making fun of people in high school well not even that it's like you  know going up going to family barbecues at my dad's house like the second we're going like hey  nice haircut faggot nice bathing suit what do you wear kids you little piece of shit getting noogies  fucking so it's like in my family if i didn't have a comeback as a 10 year old i would just get eaten  alive and just get hot dogs shoved in my mouth because i like the way they taste you know so you  know you know you know how you know how my dad is sort of how italian guys are they fucking like to  make fun of you right so is that so is that your your fallback you're like look i got about five good 
[03:44:30]  minutes right and then i can make fun of some people in the audience for a while well no like  it's it's you know if i do know if i was a headlining set you know i headlined uh mcguire's  out in long island on friday i did about 45 minutes and i would say about 30 to 32 minutes was material  and the rest was you know in intermingled just yeah intermingled intermingled and what was the  other word i used the strangest vocabulary intermingled no i'm not even telling jokes right now 
[03:45:00]  this is just your natural vocabulary of life you know my vocab is sick you're just a weird dude  that's what it is man see and i fucking you know i could so i go in and out of the crowd a little  bit you know i fuck fuck around i try to keep it interesting you know some comics like even the  best comics do that you got to fucking keep it interesting of course and you probably that makes  it a little funner for you you're not doing the same shit every night right and i'll never attack  anybody like i'll never make fun of a guy if he's fat or has one arm or a disability but you know i  will say hey nice shirt dickhead you know something like that something a genius like that 
[03:45:30]  i don't go lowest common denominator the one right above that the one denominator above it right  and i've also noticed watching you perform your style is very like to me you will attack somebody  but then right after that be like i'm just kidding bro and reach out and pound them yeah and that way  you're not attacking them because you gave them a pound right yeah like and i always make sure i  self-deprecate i always make sure the audience knows look i know i'm a piece of shit okay hey i made fun  of me so fuck you i could do anything you know right but uh that's what i do because i genuinely like 
[03:46:00]  i love it i love i don't want to hurt anybody i just we have all have a good time but i do i think  now from doing it and getting burnt a lot you know um and bombing a little bit you know coming up i can  kind of tell when someone just had enough and they don't want to be made fun of anymore and then i try  to move over give them a little more and then you yeah one more just zing and they're back all right  good night yeah make it hurt and then move and then move on so are other comics you've only been in it  for like four years about four years coming up yeah i started in here's what i did i took a class  at gotham comedy club uh in like august no i'm sorry april of 2008 how'd you do awful you did 
[03:46:30]  like d's yeah it was just awful and then there's only eight sessions and you do comedy on that you  know every sunday so i did like six of them so i really only did comedy six times in like three  months in april 2008 so i mean i guess technically i started them but i really don't count that as my  start i count my start as august of 2009 is when i really so what are you doing from april to august  i was getting my doctor in physical therapy you were a doctor yeah first of all i was intermingling 
[03:47:00]  in physical in my doctorate first of all physical therapy like when when i knew guys in college that  were majoring in physical therapy right they were just jocks i know well i mean they were like gym  teachers hello look at my fucking bone structure i was a jock i have a jock face but but why would you  get a doctrine in that i know because that's the only thing that i i wanted here's what happened i got  came out of college i was playing ball i was like i want to just you know i always want to do stand  up that's been my dream since i'm a little kid but i was like i know i need like a good fallback 
[03:47:30]  plan so let me do so let me spend eight hundred thousand dollars in a four-year doctorate program  and i'll just do this and then pay loans for the rest of my life while i'm struggling making twelve  dollars a night doing comedy so even if i'm successful as a comic i still would never be  able to have any money because i'm paying off a doctorate in physical therapy because being a doctor  of physical therapy is a solid fallback plan i went i took it to the extreme but you know so  and it's just funny to me because it's like a doctorate in physical therapy like we're not real 
[03:48:00]  doctors you know like someone some of the kids i go into school with like they call them they're  like oh i'm doctor so it's like dick you can stretch people's hamstrings but the fuck you're not a  doctor right at all what are you gonna do like if someone has a fever what are you gonna do just  massage their elbow get the fuck out of here so your parents like when you're like no comedy is  gonna be what i do are they going what about your doctorate in physical therapy that's what i did i  got the doctor to please my mother so anytime i'm on this like i can't believe you're doing comedy  you're a clown it's like ma i got a doctor you can hang that on the wall and say technically  your son's a doctor he's a doctor i did that for you ma okay i know i'm not a real doctor but now 
[03:48:30]  that i've moved into comedy full-time which i did three weeks ago that's a big that's a big step i  quit physical therapy and i do that right yeah you did you quit you wait wait you quit your day job  three weeks ago i spent i thought i was talking to a real comedian no listen i spent four years  getting my doctorate okay and then i spent two years two years being an actual physical therapist  and now i'm a comedian so so a hundred thousand dollars in debt are people going up to you in  your physical therapy office being like aren't you the dude from guy code exactly that's what 
[03:49:00]  started happening i was a pediatric physical therapist yeah so i was working with kids in a  school in chelsea and they're like you know the the the 10 11 kids like yo you're not  got from guy code sign up like yes i'm also your physical therapist so and and what happened was  is why not that i got forced to leave but i they were like look the kids know who you are it's not  an appropriate show you've missed 25 days at work they're like you're gonna get fired so why don't  you just leave actually the last time i was here i posted i was gonna be on the show on facebook  but i took off from from the board of ed so you can't do that so that's why they were like look 
[03:49:30]  you gotta fucking go we got oh so yeah last year was three weeks ago that's great no no so but i'm  happy to be it i'm happy that this happened well yeah i mean we should be getting you fired you're  not supposed to be like you know being on because you're you're one of the guys from guy code right  which is like that's a pretty big gig i would think for a comic it's a pretty big gig um you know  especially since mtv2 that's like the only show they have old sitcoms from when i was a kid right 
[03:50:00]  and guy code yeah you texted me on saturday like you keep seeing commercials and you're like i can't  see your stupid face i just saw it on thursday i can't take this shit i was sitting there and maybe  it was my fault for watching uh i was all saturday morning i was watching saved by the bell and smart  guy so i was like oh saved by the bell ended at like 11 and i was like well i guess it's time to  start the day and then it was like he's a smart guy and i was like whoa smart guy marathon i'm sticking  here yeah every other commercial break it was the same goddamn commercial where they were taking the 
[03:50:30]  guys from guy code but also promoting girl code right which you said last time your girlfriend  carly is on girl code she's on girl code and she's on the commercial with you right and it's the same  commercial and every time it's you going oh i hooked up with somebody from girl code and then she goes you  live with your mom and then charlemagne goes you're a hashtag loser right and i'm like i've seen the  goddamn commercial yeah why didn't you film more commercials well now well now they're airing new 
[03:51:00]  ones i'll have you know so now there's a commercial where um i'm like you know saying like yeah you  know i'm gonna teach you guys how to hook up with girls and then i make a makeout thing like ah to  carly and she's like disgusting and it's like watch it's the show that that's promoting is called code  wars which will be on april okay it's fucking code everything we go code crazy they just this is why  you're so lucky because mtv2 right came up with one idea absolutely and they were like we will base  our network around this one idea and you will be part of that idea and you're like holy shit what 
[03:51:30]  golden hunk of dog shit that i just stepped into let me tell you something okay and i'm this is not  in my head at all like this was just it was i was at the smith haven mall on long island all the way  on suffolk county on saturday with my girlfriend carly her family was out there i took about 20 pictures  was signing autographs what the 16 year old white kids love fucking guy code and they were going  crazy flock they even knew carly just from those commercials because all they do is watch mtv2 what 
[03:52:00]  else are you going to do in suffolk county long island besides watch mtv2 i guess so you know i don't  know what else do coke and god yeah just well when you get when you get to 15 you can start doing coke  cocaine um but it's like the show is huge like i literally almost there was a segment that aired with  my mother and i we did a we did you know because you were making fun of me because the jokes about  me live with my mom actually on one of the episodes of guy code there's a whole segment about me  living with my mom where they took the cameras into my actual mother's house i'm like this is  his room and make it fun of me ever since that aired almost every day some 16 year old white kid 
[03:52:30]  has come up to me like you're not a dude from guy code i'm like yeah you don't want to lose your  mom like yeah you're a fucking loser i'm like thanks yeah but can you tell them that you live  with your girlfriend now well yeah now i do or is that like believe me i'm like well you guys know  i live with my girlfriend i'm like yeah whatever just take a picture of me and then they'll tweet it  at me yo saw at christy comedy the one that lives with his mom tell your moms i said what's up yo  oh my god and guy code is just like it's a show it's on mtv too i would say what time it's on but  it's just not all the time it's on all the time now and actually the season's over so it's girl 
[03:53:00]  code is the next one coming out and that's going to be on april 23rd starts mtv not mtv2 mtv  how did girl code get mtv at 10 30 because the codes are blowing up baby but what about guy code on mtv  this is bullshit well they're going to start playing guy code on mtv to promote girl code but  guy code is an mtv 2 show that's like their big show you know gets all the ratings their only show  that keeps that one on mtv too right where girl code now is gonna because i think you know the  audiences on mtv are a lot more girls watch mtv and a lot more guys watch mtv too i didn't know this 
[03:53:30]  see i think that well you're not i'm in the fucking ins on mtv so i can tell you we were just talking  about it today like and i was talking about it with my wife like i texted her this morning right  and i was like we got to see that movie pitch perfect right and she was like what and i was  like yeah no we got to see it yeah and she was like why and i said because apparently the whole  open from last night's mtv movie awards jess and me are sitting there going like why are they just  sitting there singing songs this is so stupid i don't understand this at all right but it was the 
[03:54:00]  cast of this movie pitch perfect right that i guess is huge with the teens exactly and i'm like we got  to see the because we can't not know what the teens are doing look mtv is so smart in the fact  that like you know they'll put like guys like me like adults on the show on the network and but they  know that like the thing that we're doing is geared towards 13 and 14 year old kids so they know what  to do they're not trying they don't care if adults like the show or they don't care if you've seen the  show because they know the 15 year old kids see the show and that's who's watching the network so 
[03:54:30]  like if a bunch of people you know 35 plus are sitting there being like this is so this is terrible  it is shitty show i want them to say that because your kids are the one who are watching it yeah and  hopefully if you think it's cool your kids won't exactly so we want the adults to think it sucks  it's good that you got your girlfriend involved in the show then because otherwise you'd be sitting  there being like no i gotta know what's going on with american idol right she'd be like what the  fuck well my girl my girlfriend's a specific case because she's more of a man than i am she is she  has well she has yeah she's italian you know so she has more hair in her arms and shit but 
[03:55:00]  no but she's like the set like i'm the one who's always like do you want to have a picnic and she's like  what are you a fucking pussy like why would i want to have a picnic let's just drink beers and  take shits and not flush them you're trying to think of romantic ideas i always try to don't  like you want to walk in highline park and she was like are you fucking serious chris so you're the  one who's in the bathroom like letting the faucet run while you're shitting and then lighting a match  and spraying some shit and she's like chris you got to see the floater i left in there totally  oh god she's more so she's like the she's like um you know the edgy girl on girl code but 
[03:55:30]  how are you with that though because like for me i don't any of the shitting habits that go on  with my wife i'm i'm no part of that as far as i'm concerned we've been together for eight years  wow and as far as i'm concerned in that eight years jess has never defecated once really she's  never she never shat well what what happens when she has to shit in your home that's up to her to  decide wow i mean hide it that's like saying like oh the kids are home we got to convince them that 
[03:56:00]  santa claus is still real well don't let her see you putting that shit out i under the tree well  here's what i here's what my move is is i always when i have to take a shit i put the shower on so  she thinks i'm taking a shower and i you know i come out wet but sometimes it's not because i took  a shower it's because i took a fucking really painful shit it's sweating i pushed and she's  like oh my god you know you smell even worse i'm like well we gotta get new soaps it's your fucking  dirty loofah um but uh obviously there was some carly left over what she used to do now it's okay now 
[03:56:30]  she just takes you know full-blown shits and lets me know and it's fun and it's cute but she used to  say is it she well yeah she used to be like chris you know we need milk and i'm like we have three  coins of milk and she'd be like just go to the store and get milk and i would come back and the  whole room would be lit up in candles and incense and i would be like oh you just blew out your colon  yeah you know yeah i know it just went down it's like if i know right you might as well not hide it  anymore yeah so now we're open about it now she's cool with it you know like i go into the bathroom  and i shut the door like piss with the door open i think that's fine yeah but you shut the door when 
[03:57:00]  you shit and you turn the faucet on right but just like i know that she knows what happens when i shut  the door and the faucet's on for 15 minutes straight so you're even embarrassed to shit in front of your  wife yeah i don't want to do that really i don't want to do that see i don't know like we fart we shit  i initiated that though i took a chance we were in the movies that is a chance and i just fucking ripped  the fart and just as it was settling i was like i'm i had a countdown 10 seconds till she smells it  this is going to determine what it's going to be like she took a whiff and was like you're disgusting 
[03:57:30]  and then kissed me on the lips i was like will you fucking marry me that's great will you marry me  that's great you're like waiting like isn't that funny no really isn't it is it or not because i need  to know where you stand on this right now this fart the second this fart hits your nose your reaction  is going to determine the next 50 years of my life no there's no uh no no farting okay between my  i respect that you gotta i feel like you gotta go either way but that's my nature hey like if i  needed a girl like i don't do that because uh i don't want her to be disgusted like i don't you get 
[03:58:00]  to e-rock he's in there you ever hear me have i ever farted in front of you not that i'm aware of you  see i don't do that that's not my thing i respect that so i'm but i made sure just knew that going in  you know what if she was down if she if she accepted and she said i want to move forward with this man  knowing that i can't express my bodily functions the way i want right then that was her choice right  and you guys made a great choice if jess was my wife she probably would have dumped me you know  two months in the relationship because i have gash fuck gaseous activities flowing out of my ass right 
[03:58:30]  24 7 you know and now that i went vegan i tried a little vegan products and the fucking vegan cheese  just rips a hole in you i can't do it anymore it's over why did you try vegan i tried it for two weeks  because my cholesterol was high but i'm like look i can't eat soy shit i really can't no it's gonna give  me bitch tits yeah and that's you're a physical therapist by trade a doctor of physical therapy  yeah that's the last thing you can have i was out like uh me and my wife went to dinner with my  brother like a couple weeks ago and i don't know something happens sometimes where my body tells me 
[03:59:00]  you got to change your diet because i eat a lot of fried food right i love soda love it you know that's  what but it's not good for your insides no especially when you get start to get to our age  and the diet soda is even worse is it that's what they say the aspartame or whatever they  say that just fucks your whole shit up fucking cancer but like probably for both of it up until  your early 20s you can still just whatever you want thousand percent right so this is a point where 
[03:59:30]  we're learning your body responds negatively to a lot of this stuff sure so there are times when  it's bad you know and i'll get these like horrible pains and i'm like this is like this is gonna be  45 minutes right and it happens immediately 45 minute shit yeah okay 45 minutes up and down and  it's like i think i'm done but i'm still in a lot of pain obviously i'm not done no okay messy shit  it's like an explosion right and then still pain okay and so you know there's more explosiveness to  come so right you might as well stay in the bathroom yeah so like i had to uh i i went to 
[04:00:00]  the bathroom while we were in the restaurant and i was down there for like 10 15 minutes 10 minutes  that's ballsy man 10 15 minute shit in a restaurant yeah because now the other tables realize where that  guy where is he he's like that dude with the big hair yeah like i know i saw dude yeah and the  waitress is coming by like you guys need refills you know we're just waiting we're just wait okay  awkwardly yeah and so then i was like i came back up and of course just like you okay yeah we got 
[04:00:30]  fine yeah pissing keep going with the conversation so we left the restaurant got in the car and the  pain start coming back real bad and we're like 20 minutes away from home and i'm like this is oh  shit i gotta make a call right now we pull out of the parking spot right i'm like oh boy this is like  i really got and we start driving i'm like okay and we drive to the end of the parking lot ready  to pull out and then i'm like no i gotta i gotta do the right thing right here and i said jess hang 
[04:01:00]  on a second can we stop right in the back uh right in the restaurant again she was like yeah sure did  you forget something and i go no i just have some weird gas pains so you've told her i just i got  some gas pains that's what i said you went back into the restaurant so yeah i had to walk back in  through the back because that's where the parking lot was so everybody through the back because you're  ashamed you're not walking through the front door with your health head held high anymore but guess  what yeah the bathroom's located near the front door oh my god so you got to walk back through 
[04:01:30]  the waitress that said goodbye to me three minutes ago was she hot too yeah jesus of course she was  of course you knew in that situation of course she was of course she is so what'd you do so you just  let it rip i went straight back down to the bathroom i was probably in there for another 15 minutes  oh my god while jess and my brother were in the car now now did your brother say anything did your  brother make light of that joke about that is he like how my brother's taking a shit or he's kind  of with on your page he's he's more on me and i think that must be the way we were raised yeah let's  let's get into what do you mean like did your do your parents not shit in front of each other they  look like the type of people i'm not gonna lie okay who say you know what you know your mom said like 
[04:02:00]  you know she likes my comedy the roads my first instinct to your mom she's had a woman says i take a  shit in front of my husband really that's what i thought about that was just the vibe you got  it was like she seems like a yeah a betty crocker homemaker but right she'll drop a deuce in front  of sam's dad sweet woman great woman i would love to come over family dinner but i know her and your  dad have shit battles nightly and that was one of the great things about us all leaving to college  was that there's plenty of time for nightly shit battles that's it no there was no uh they did 
[04:02:30]  separate bathrooms okay you know and they did all their stuff separately and i didn't know like i've  nothing you mentioned it right i don't know that my mother has ever shat you've never i don't know  that she ever has oh interesting i have no memory i know my dad has sure not because of when it's  taking place but because i mean literally you could walk by the bathroom and know what had just happened  in there really oh yeah so it smelled but but my dad let me tell you and i've told the audience about 
[04:03:00]  this before like his idea of a snack on a sunday afternoon like this is a he calls it uh some of  the world's great treats he said that i swear to god that's his quote that's awesome he he will eat  a sardine and onion sandwich with buttermilk that's his beverage what is he pregnant i don't know  yeah i've got these cravings oh my god his hormones are going crazy but that's obviously going to make a  shit smell a lot you know better or worse whatever way you know whatever type of light you like to 
[04:03:30]  look at in your shit you know it's and it's going to give it it's going to make it pungent yeah yeah  and it did so i know but i don't know that my mom has ever taken a shit really see i see but you grew  up in a house you said right house see i grew up in an apartment in the brooklyn queens borderline it  was just my mom and i so my bedroom was right next to the bathroom so there was no hiding it in my  house and that may you know what we just got into something deep that i never even thought about  that's the reason why i shit in front of carly all the time in her family they all shit in front of 
[04:04:00]  each other all the time that's the reason why we're comfortable with each other because i had  no choice but to let my mom know that i was shitting and her let i know that i was shitting  our apartment was too small there was no hiding it you couldn't you could not mask it you couldn't  mask the smell you couldn't mask the sound we had a we always had a toilet that would clog it's like we  know what's going on yeah my dad wasn't around to fix it so there was plenty of times i had to go in  there and just take care of my mom's vietnam shit oh jesus christ and you're like this is where i 
[04:04:30]  need a father what happened to your dad why is my dad in prison yeah horrible yeah let's go to ken  in texas hey how you doing fellows i i think we need to now approach the subject which women  are totally in denial of they fart in their sleep this is something i'm on patrol over i've never known  it to happen with my wife but i mean that's something i will blame her for like she she  can't i don't want her farting in her sleep right i gotta i mean this farting thing i gotta fart right  now you no it's good i appreciate that you can do that and that's something and that's a little 
[04:05:00]  something i can accept also for the radio audience they enjoy that and i'm happy that that picked up  i heard that in my own headset good good for me chris good colon good colon good for you yeah  but like i dated it was i dated this black girl 5 11 smoking hot look like she was a model  really she was hot she was hot all right we're walking up her driveway right and uh probably like  20 years old and she lets a little fart out wow and i go whoa whoa whoa whoa what was that 
[04:05:30]  and she goes oh that's okay it was just a little cute one ha ha and she kind of giggles and i go yeah  ha ha but in my head i was like that's the end of me being attracted to you and you know and that  was it i mean we i mean you shallow bastard the relationship didn't end immediately okay but it  wasn't long after that wow wasn't long after that and that and so you're saying had she not farted  you could be with the 5 11 black chick instead of the beautiful jess much to my mother's chagrin 
[04:06:00]  maybe wow yeah once you once your mother's disapproval yeah yeah maybe but that was enough you know  ken carly my girlfriend and she's over she farts in the sleep all the time and she does she does and  she giggles at it and she think and i'll wake and we'll wake up and i'll say carly you know you  fart in your sleep she'll say no i didn't i'll say yes you did there's a hole in the sheet okay you  were ripping ass yeah it's a big one yeah does that ever wake you up in the night i i've been up  holy shit we're haunted i've been up and i've it's they smell you know she's a little fucking girl so
