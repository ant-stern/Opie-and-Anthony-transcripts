<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with a prank call montage played by Kid Chris from KXOA in Sacramento, where he impersonated various celebrities to convince O.J. Simpson to "kill somebody." Opie and Anthony then recounted a similar prank they’d pulled on a Boston Celtics player using his pager, detailing the humorous and sexually suggestive messages left for him.  This was followed by a highly graphic and sexually explicit phone call with Stalker Patty, a 45-year-old virgin, who detailed her sexual fantasies and masturbation habits in explicit detail. The hosts engaged in equally crude and suggestive responses.

The show then shifted to discussing Regis Philbin's alleged affair, reading aloud explicit excerpts from the woman’s diary detailing their sexual encounters.  This segment also featured sexually explicit descriptions and jokes.  Barry Williams, the actor who played Greg Brady, then appeared in studio. He delivered a comedic rant about being the "real" Greg Brady and the misrepresentation of *The Brady Bunch*.  This led to a discussion about Robert Reed's (Mike Brady's) alleged sexuality, referencing suggestive photos on foundrymusic.com. Barry Williams was called in again to comment, dismissing rumors of a confrontation with the cast and discussing Reed's role as a transsexual in an episode of *Medical Center*.

The show then featured David and Simon, two Australian penis puppeteers. They described their act, detailing the various shapes they formed with their penises ("the hamburger," "the turtle," etc.), their audience (mostly men), and the evolution of their performance. They mentioned their instructional book, *Puppetry for the Penis*.  Barry Williams remained in the studio during this segment, offering occasional commentary on *The Brady Bunch*. The puppeteers provided contact information for their New York show.  Female callers and studio guests reacted with varying degrees of amusement, disgust, and surprise.

The next segment covered Opie's frustrating experiences at the DMV, detailed in humorous frustration at bureaucratic hurdles and lack of funds for phone calls. This transitioned into a discussion of their VMAs coverage, focusing on the difficulties in interviewing celebrities due to publicists and their solution: employing two women referred to as "retarded Laverne and Shirley" or "Marion and Lady Di" as interviewers.  Audio clips of these interviews with Alicia Keys, Little Moe, Nate Dogg (mistaken for Kato Kaelin), Will Ferrell, the Backstreet Boys, Ja Rule, Fatboy Slim, Dale Earnhardt Jr., and Lincoln Park were played.  These interviews were characterized by inappropriate comments, nonsensical questions, and general incoherence. This segment also included a discussion of Kimmy from *Survivor: Australia*'s sexual experiences and explicit descriptions of oral sex. A call from Paul and a brief appearance by Triumph the Insult Comic Dog with Carson Daly punctuated the segment.  More clips of the "retarded Laverne and Shirley" interviews and commentary followed.  John Valby and Mike from *Real World: New York* were also mentioned (Valby having left early).

The final segment extensively detailed their VMAs experiences, focusing on their attempts to interview celebrities.  They recounted humorous and awkward interactions, their frustration at the media's preference for Carrot Top over Mark Wahlberg, a rushed interview with Destiny's Child's stepchild,  failed attempts to interview Mick Jagger, Montel Williams (who was insulted by one of the hosts), and other celebrities.  Jim Norton's recurring "you dropped something" prank was also featured.  Numerous celebrities were mentioned including Mark Wahlberg, Carrot Top, NSYNC, Gwen Stefani, Christopher Walken, Bon Jovi, Richie Sambora, Tommy Hilfiger, Jason Sehorn, Destiny's Child, Carson Daly, Kelly Ripa, Sway (MTV News), Andrew Cuomo, Mick Jagger, and Jimmy Kimmel. Jim Norton called in to discuss the events, and the hosts mentioned a post-VMAs encounter with Fatboy Slim.  The segment was filled with yelling, expletives, and crude humor.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie, you scum, and Anthony.  Your new name is Dick.  Opie and Anthony.  What changed you into such demonic little bastards?  1-0-2-7.  Kick-ass.  W-N-E-W.  And we're back with the O&A show.  I have Kid Chris on the line, Anthony.  Oh, yeah?  He's from KXOA.  Right.  KXOA.  KXOA.  Yeah, they want you to emphasize the X. 
[00:00:30]  One of the stations we're on in Sacramento, California,  and he emailed me this O.J. prank call tape.  Hilarious.  Let's get him on the line.  Kid Chris.  Hey, kid.  What's up?  O to the is-ay?  Do you like being called Kid or Kid Chris?  It doesn't matter.  You can just call me Kid Chris, Kid, whatever.  He's also friends with our buddy Scorch, Anthony.  Today is Scorch, King of Innocence. 
[00:01:00]  Totally new radio.  Hey, dude, you're dressing.  You know, I worked with Scorch for a long-ass time up in Syracuse.  Yeah?  Yeah, I got a funny story about Scorch, actually.  He was like the PD for a while, you know?  Yeah.  And we were on, I was on in the morning at the time.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, slow down.  He was the PD up there in Syracuse for a while?  For a little while, yeah.  PD on a PD.  Imagine him, he used to, you know, he'd sit down with jocks and tell them what to do and what not to do.  Oh, wow. 
[00:01:30]  You're making Ben lose his mind.  Ben loves Scorch.  Ben loves Scorch stories.  Oh, no, here's a funny Scorch story.  He was, I was working in the morning at the time, and we were on the radio talking about how he's the, you know, the boss and all that stuff, and how he's giving us a hard time.  And he had the windows on his Jeep slash because of that.  Really?  Yeah, somebody whacked his Jeep.  Nice.  So, kid, you're on after us in Sacramento?  Yeah, it's 7 o'clock.  Right on.  What's the buzz out there in Sacramento? 
[00:02:00]  Ah, man, you know, I'll tell you, the station is huge, I mean, I think.  I mean, it's the hottest one in town because this is the way radio right now, you know?  Yeah.  You know, and when all this stuff's going down, like last week with the terrorist attacks and stuff, you know, this station's the only one being real, you know?  Everybody else is playing their music and they're top eight at eight and all that crap, and nobody, you know.  Getting the lead out.  Yeah.  Mandatory Metallica.  Yeah, just the, you know, the phoniness, pretend like nothing's happening, you know?  We had a bunch of stations in New York do exactly that and worked not even two miles from the disaster area. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, it's sickening.  So, you emailed me about an OJ prank call tape.  Yeah, I did this a while ago.  We got, you know, it pays when you're in radio.  It pays when you got people that have regular jobs, you know, the real jobs.  Yeah.  Listen, because like a guy that worked for one of the cell phone companies looked up OJ's cell phone number in his database or whatever and got me the number.  Oh, dude.  Years ago, man.  You're bringing back a memory.  Ant and I, the exact same thing happened to us when we were up in Boston. 
[00:03:00]  We can't name who it was.  We had one of the Boston Celtics' cell phone number.  No, what was it?  Uh, pagers.  His messaging service.  Uh, his messaging service.  And we got the codes.  We got to check out everyone calling this superstar.  You listened to his messages?  Dude, it was the only, it was the only way, the only thing we did to prepare for our show in Boston.  We'll admit it now. 
[00:03:30]  We would spend, what, Anthony, a half hour every day going through all the messages.  Uh, real estate agents trying to find a house for this guy.  Hey, baby, I hear you going to be in.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  I'm heading to that.  So you had the real estate agencies trying to find a house.  You had the car dealers going.  One car dealer was pissed off because the guy did not return the car.  It was like three months overdue.  Right.  Man.  Uh, then you had a gaming company saying, hey, we're working on a blah, blah game with, uh, you know.  Coach called him.  With PlayStation. 
[00:04:00]  We got, uh, yeah, the coaches calling him.  Did girls leave their numbers on it?  That's, that's the, the.  90% of it was chicks.  We got chicks from all over America.  All over the country.  Just booties in every city.  Yeah, and they, and they all thought they were the one.  It was hilarious.  Did you call the girls?  I hear you going to be in Los Angeles this week.  Why don't you give me a call?  Yeah, you had girls calling from every city.  Did you call the girls at all?  No.  Um, no.  We didn't make any calls.  No, no, because we didn't want to mess it up.  We had this number for months, and we just figured if we, if we, if we effed with it too much, we would, you know, we would screw ourselves. 
[00:04:30]  Who was it?  We can't say.  He's still, he's still up there, man.  So?  It's not like we did anything with it.  What's the matter of?  What was that?  It was, it was, uh, Walker.  What?  I didn't say nothing.  Hey, Twan.  So drunk girls calling from all over America in the middle of, like, clubs and stuff, and, and then you get the ones that are really pissed off because they thought they were the only ones. 
[00:05:00]  Right.  Oh, man.  It was, it was some of the best stuff, and we couldn't put any, any of it on the radio.  I know.  Doesn't that suck?  We would have got screwed.  I know, but they, oh, man, that sucks.  It's kind of like one of those things where you, you think it over.  How can I get away with this?  How can I do this?  I thought you were special.  Yeah.  I thought you were special.  I thought you were a real man.  Yeah.  You're nothing but a little boy.  You're nothing but, you're telling a guy making millions upon millions of dollars that he's a little boy. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  Like he cares.  That's great.  Then he had his homies calling.  It was, oh.  Any dirt?  Did you get any dirt?  Well, just the, just the women that, uh, you know.  Oh, we wanted to hear, you know.  Something big.  Was he, was he married or anything?  Nah, nah, nah.  Shit.  Man, I got your stuff.  You know, something like that.  Right.  Never heard that.  No, we never heard any of that stuff.  But it was great to hear these women, man.  Anyway, so, uh, this guy gave you OJ's cell phone number? 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, he came up to me at one of my bar remotes.  He gave me the, he gave me the number and, uh, uh, he didn't tell me what it was at first.  So I went home and called it like on a Sunday morning and he kept answering the phone.  I'm sitting there, I kept calling him and I couldn't recognize the voice.  And he's all like, hello, who is this?  Hello.  And I'm like, who are you?  And then, like, the next day he called me and told me who it was.  And then we started this thing on the air.  We called every hour for like a week straight.  And we had people guess how long before he would disconnect the number.  Now, that's a good bit, my friend. 
[00:06:30]  That's much better than douche dressing.  I don't see.  You know, that's about it.  And Scorch comes up with some good stuff.  I wish, like, he wouldn't go on the radio.  I wish he'd just email me the ideas.  Douche dressing.  Douche dressing.  So you called O.J., I mean, just hysterical stuff.  Yeah, the montage there is, like, my favorite.  I have other ones, too.  I'll send you guys, too.  Really?  We are huge O.J. fans.  Oh, who isn't?  I mean, any time, Chris, that O.J.'s in the news, don't you just go, oh, God, I got to read every word.  Exactly. 
[00:07:00]  Of the article.  I love it.  He's so stupid.  And he's such a phony, too, because he tries, he phony laughs everything off.  And you'll hear that in the cold.  Oh, yeah.  Phony laughs stuff off.  We love it, though.  We love reading in the paper.  My favorite post-murder article about O.J. has to be when he was breaking into his girlfriend's house to steal the audio tapes on the answering machine because he left threatening messages.  It's like, hi, you bitch, I'm going to slit your throat if you...  Uh-oh.  Okay. 
[00:07:30]  Look, I'm going to break into your house, but please don't call the police.  Or the 911 tapes.  Oh, those are classic.  Yeah, where he's throwing that other dude under the bus.  He sold out Pedro Guerrero.  No, no, she's with Pedro Guerrero.  He was caught with a kilo of cocaine.  Do we have the...  That's P-E-D.  Do we have the Pedro Guerrero one?  Sold him down the river, man.  He's got to kill two people, and he's wearing a Pedro Guerrero.  Yeah.  Our O.J. prank call tape thing is hilarious.  If we can find the short version, we'll play it today.  And then when O.J. called up 911, he's telling her about how the girlfriend took off, and 911 goes, are there any weapons or anything? 
[00:08:00]  He goes, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Not this time.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  He is killer, man.  Literally and figuratively.  So Kid Chris from KXOA out there in Sacramento, he gave us the montage.  Yeah.  It's about almost two minutes long, and it's really...  We were laughing so hard, we played it about ten times in the back office.  It's you calling O.J., and it's really funny, man. 
[00:08:30]  All right, let's check this out.  Yeah.  Oh, Juice?  Yeah.  Yeah, what are you doing?  Who's this?  This is A.C.  Let's go kill somebody tonight.  Hi.  Juice?  Yeah, hello.  O.J.?  Who's this?  It's Al Michaels.  My wife's been acting like a real bitch.  I was wondering if you could help me kill her.  What do you say, champ? 
[00:09:00]  Do I know you?  Hey.  Juice, it's Chris Rock.  It's me, Chris Rock, Juice.  What do you say you and I go kill the Spice Girls?  Juice, every time I call you, I always be laughing.  Hello?  Juice, you're late.  We're supposed to go out and kill people tonight.  What's going on?  I really can't talk.  I'm at dinner with a bunch of people, and I have no idea who you are.  I'm the real killer. 
[00:09:30]  O.J.?  Oh, hello?  Yeah.  Yeah, Juice.  Juice.  Yeah.  Juice, what's up?  What is it?  It's Dan Dierdorf.  You want to go throw the ball around, you know, have some beers, maybe kill somebody?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hi, O.J., it's Kato.  Well, I want to go pick up some young girls and kill them. 
[00:10:00]  We can hold them underwater or something.  How'd I go?  Can I move in with you?  Hello?  Hi, O.J.  Hey.  Hey, it's Marcus Allen.  Want to go get some bitches and kill them?  And there you have it.  Kid Chris, that's hilarious.  That is so funny.  Chris, you want to go get some girls and kill them?  Bravo, Chris.  Hey, bro. 
[00:10:30]  Hey, I know exactly what you're talking about, about that fake O.J. laugh.  Yeah.  You got me, guys.  He's laughing.  I killed you people, and I'm out.  You're next, Crackle Boy.  Yeah.  You better not have no caller ID, man.  Yeah.  Come and get you.  Man, you made our day with that.  Yeah, very good, man.  Thank you.  Good.  Thank you, bro.  We're getting requests to put that on our website.  Is that cool?  Yeah.  I mean, those are ancient.  I got those, too, if anybody. 
[00:11:00]  I mean, I got others I'll send you, too.  I've got, like, we would bring girls in the studio, you know, because he loves the women.  Right.  Yeah.  And we would have girls call him and try to hook up with him and stuff, and then, you  know, at the end, he'd be all like, well, I can't right now.  I've got to go do it.  And he'd be like, oh, please, I want you to get mad and kill me.  What is any O.J.-related stuff?  Always welcome.  Yes.  All right.  We'll put that clip on our website, foundrymusic.com.  We'll give you the plug and stuff.  Cool, bro.  Do you have an email address or something we can put on there? 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, well, kidchris at AOL.com.  Look at you.  You got the kidchris at AOL.com.  Word.  Two Ds, extra D for dollars.  Someone else out there has kidchris583 because you have the original one.  Yeah, well, good.  All right.  Cool.  We'll put it on the website, and we'll put your email and all that.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks, kid.  All right.  See you.  Kid Chris from KXOA.  He's on after us in Sacramento.  That's funny stuff.  That is funny.  We'll put that on foundrymusic.com, F-O-U-N-D-R-Y, music.com.  Is it up there already?  Yo, yo, juice. 
[00:12:00]  Yo, juice.  I love it.  Yeah, who is this?  Should I go kill someone?  I got to go.  I'm having dinner with people I plan on killing later.  Could you not call me?  Steve already put it up there.  Oh, great.  So check it out on our foundrymusic.  It gets funnier the more you hear it.  Yeah.  We heard it at least ten times.  Great.  We had the OJ 911 crank call bit?  Yeah.  All right.  We'll play this as we go to break.  We'll be back.  Is OJ putting out a prank call tape? 
[00:12:30]  Is that what's going on here?  The best of OJ.  Right.  I call 911 around the country.  Get my 911 comedy tape.  OJ calls 911.  Hello, 911?  911 operator.  Is your refrigerator running there?  Yes, it is.  Well, you better catch it.  911?  911, what's your emergency?  Hello.  Do you have Prince Albert in a can? 
[00:13:00]  What do you mean?  Do you have Prince Albert in a can?  Yes, we do.  Well, you better let him out before he suffocates.  Comedy tape.  All of yours now.  He's a big old man.  Hello.  Is this 911?  Yes.  Do you have ten-pound balls?  Yes, we do. 
[00:13:30]  How do you walk?  You get the best of OJ Simpson.  I got to go now.  I got to find her.  He's all concerned.  Man, is he bored, huh?  Oh, man.  I was hoping he would do the famous butt plug up.  Try to call it.  Hello, 911?  Yes.  I'm looking for Michael Hunt.  Is he there?  He goes by the name of Mike. 
[00:14:00]  Laugh along with your favorite murderer, OJ.  Number one?  Yes.  Uh, butt plug.  Bug box?  Butt plug.  What are you looking for?  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Don't make me cut your throat, mother...  Does OJ do any, like, character voices on his prank call tape? 
[00:14:30]  Kind of like the jerky voices?  I'll come down there with my toolbox.  I'll bash your head in with a ratchet.  Or a knife.  I'm OJ.  Oops, I just cut myself on a piece of foam rubber.  I'd better fly to Chicago. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, man.  That's the OJ Simpson 911 comedy tape.  Order yours now.  Who that is?  Oh, and I roll!  Conquer Earth, you bastards!  1027 WNEW.  Uh, Stalker Patty, yeah. 
[00:15:30]  Hey, how are ya?  Oh, here's one that was down there.  Yes, I was there.  The new hairless, nippled Stalker Patty.  I'm still not done yet.  I got two more points to go.  Hey, Patty.  What?  One of our faithful listeners gave us Zoloft last night.  Gave us a big, like, starter package of Zoloft.  This is a true story.  Now, I don't know what Zoloft is.  Patty, I take it to keep from killing y'all.  Patty, I know you want to be close to the show and stuff.  If you come down here right now and take some Zoloft, 
[00:16:00]  Opie, we cannot dispense prescription medicine on this show.  Uh, I don't take any kind of prescription medicine.  We want to give the Zoloft to someone to see what it does to a person.  Yeah, thank you.  Would you be willing to come down and OD on Zoloft?  No.  I don't think we could dispense narcotics.  I'm on the Zoloft thing, right?  But I'm on that to keep me from killing y'all.  No.  Thank God for the Zoloft.  So, you will not come down here and take some Zoloft?  No, I won't.  Because that would hurt my body. 
[00:16:30]  Well, your body's hurting.  Things pretty hurting already.  What do you mean by that?  Would you be able, would you actually accept Opie as your first love?  Your first lover?  Your first F?  No, you're talking nonsense, okay?  She didn't say no.  No, I wouldn't.  Why not?  Isn't he, don't you like his personality?  Oh, I love you both.  I really do.  Don't you, uh...  But not in that way. 
[00:17:00]  Wouldn't you like to have him take away that blessed virginity of yours?  Haught it out!  I would rather meet somebody who's unattached than, you know, somebody that I care about very much, you know, like in the future.  Someday that will happen.  Talking about the Jetsons' future.  Patty, you're 45, you've never made out with a guy.  What are you waiting for?  I'm waiting to meet the right person.  I've never had that opportunity. 
[00:17:30]  Most girls, uh...  Well, you know, you've got to understand my background, too.  I come from a very...  Oh, you're like in the keyster?  No, no.  Oh, I thought you meant by background.  I come from a church background.  And, uh...  Uh-huh.  I've been sort of like, uh, you know, in the 80s when I graduated college, I was at work a lot, and I kind of like, uh, isolated myself.  I didn't get much of a social life, either.  Ah, a church background.  So, you're into young boys?  No.  Were you molested by a priest or a nun? 
[00:18:00]  No.  Oh.  It's just that I was living among people that would make you feel like when you were young that the Lord would strike you dead or something like that.  Oh, God.  Well, Patty, he will.  He will, Patty, he will.  So, it's like you never have the opportunity to actually socialize.  Anthony, I've got to read one of Rick's lines, okay?  Her unpopped, rotten cherry that looks like a removed tonsil.  What?  Oh, God, that's horrible.  You know something, Patty?  Most girls save their virginity because it is such a precious gift to the man. 
[00:18:30]  But at your age now, it's going to be like giving away, I don't know, a 72 Buick.  You know what I mean?  It's not that precious a gift anymore, you know?  And the longer you wait, the less precious it gets.  People would rather have a McDonald's apple pie.  Well, Anthony, that moment will come, I'm sure, with the right person, a special person. 
[00:19:00]  I don't think so.  Can we get you a banging?  You just got to let loose because I don't think you're going to find the guy that you're looking for the way you're looking.  You have no social life, so you don't really mingle and meet people that you might come across this dream guy.  I know I get intimidated when I go into places like, you know, like a bar.  I've gone in to use the restroom and come out, but I don't drink, you know, or anything.  Yeah, that helps. 
[00:19:30]  Especially for the guy.  I don't drink for medical reasons.  I don't be on drugs.  I don't know why you've got to be so mean.  Because I don't do anything to that.  Usually when I'm mean to someone, they get the hint and they leave me alone.  No, it's attention that you're giving her.  When you're mean, it's just attention.  It doesn't matter.  Good attention, bad attention.  You're giving her attention.  Oh.  And she takes that as some type of relationship.  Hello.  That you two have.  Hello. 
[00:20:00]  Right, Patty?  I don't think that's right.  I do.  No.  Shut up, bitch.  That's funny.  I don't think I'm that type of a person.  Dave, what's up?  Dude, how you doing?  Hey.  Listen, you know, she's really like a virgin or something like that.  Yeah.  And she's like 45 years old.  You know, like when you're like 15 and you're going to go on your first date, you know, and  you're a girl or something like that, and it happens and it's, you know, like it's just  a little bit of pressure and it pops, you know? 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  Well, I'm with you.  She's, she's, she's, she's 45 years old, man.  It's like, right now.  Right.  Dude, you, you should take a sore sore to that.  Patty, you got, Patty, you got to dust off that peach and, you know, crack it open.  You ever watch the Discovery Channel and they have the mummies that they bring up and they're  naked, you know?  Because they're naked.  And they pan down and you're like, oh, look at mummy genitals.  Patty, do you have mummy genitals? 
[00:21:00]  No.  You can see if there's like a, like an ancient Egyptian beer cap, beer cap in there.  Hey, Patty.  What?  If we invite you down here, can we take a look at your peach?  No.  Don't buy that.  No.  I want to see what's nastier.  Sandy Cain's hemorrhoid ridden ass or your peach?  No.  I can't do that.  I'm embarrassed.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  You got a lot of, uh, a lot of growth?  No. 
[00:21:30]  No?  No.  Do you keep it nice and clean?  Yes, I do.  Well, I have very good hygiene.  Hygiene?  Yeah.  Not very good genes, very good hygiene.  And not hygiene, it's hygiene.  Hygiene.  That's the accent on the wrong swam.  Is gene your boyfriend?  What?  Hygiene.  Hygiene.  What are you, scrub that thing?  Well, no more than anybody would in a shower.  Hey, Patty, does your cherry have fruit flies?  No.  That's horrible.  Hey, Patty, have you ever had an orgasm? 
[00:22:00]  Oh, that's a good question.  Well, I have the urges about ten days after my month.  Wait, that's about it.  Wait a minute.  Oh, my.  She's got the urges ten days.  Use it or lose it.  What does that even mean?  What?  You get urges when?  About ten days.  You know what?  Every woman gets that.  That's normal.  I think they get urges more than once a month.  So, these urges, do you take care of them manually, if you know what I mean? 
[00:22:30]  They come and they go.  It's got a minute.  You.  You.  I don't know.  You know.  Patty.  What?  What do you do when these urges come on? 
[00:23:00]  They usually pass.  But don't you, like, take care of it?  Well, there's no talk about it.  Oh, my.  Do it.  Do it.  Come on.  Come on.  Kill me.  I'm here.  Kill me.  I'm here.  Kill me.  Come on.  Kill me.  I'm here.  Come on.  Do it now.  Kill me.  I even Arnold can't take this conversation.  Patty.  Yes.  You take care of your urges. 
[00:23:30]  Well.  How do you take care of your urges?  I think this is going to be hot.  Yeah.  You know, that's not an easy subject for me to talk about.  What do you do?  What do you do?  What do you do to take care of those urges?  Trust me.  No one is listening to this anymore.  Your days are finger banging.  Old Mary Jane rotten crotch through her purdy pig pennies are over.  So, Patty.  I don't know.  I'm just normal like everybody else.  Is it your hand?  Do you do a little of what they call the diddle? 
[00:24:00]  Do you diddle the, you know.  I'm embarrassed.  You're really embarrassing me.  That's all right.  I hope you clean your fingernails afterwards.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Oh, you just.  Look, I'm very hygienic.  I hope you're not serving any Big Macs after that.  No.  Oh, God.  I'm getting an urge.  And I have to serve up some Big Mac.  Look at this. 
[00:24:30]  I got some special sauce in my panties.  Shut up.  Shut up.  So, Patty, the urge comes on.  Got milk?  Got milk?  How'd you like to suck my ass?  What?  So, the urge has come on 10 days after your little friend is arrived?  Um, yes.  All right.  So, you're laying all alone at home.  And what happened?  Well, I don't know.  What normal people do, I guess?  Oh, my God.  Patty. 
[00:25:00]  Patty.  Patty.  Let me tell you something right now.  What?  And trust me.  I hate you.  I don't have a habit.  Well, not a habit.  Not only will I buy you breakfast at the Broken Diner, I will sit with you and enjoy your company.  Nice.  But what do you do to satisfy the urges?  How do I do it?  Yeah.  Well, um, fantasy, I guess?  Yeah, baby.  You know, I think of, like, maybe cute guys or something.  Do I make you horny? 
[00:25:30]  Don't even ask the question.  Don't even ask the question.  All right, all right.  You know, you imagine cute guys.  And look at Patty.  Patty, can I ask you one question?  Sure.  And be honest.  And be honest.  Sure.  And be honest, because we're all friends here, Patty.  Okay.  I turned off your mic.  Don't get here, you, Anthony.  Patty?  Yes?  Have you ever, and be honest, we're just friends talking about, have you ever used Opie  in any of these fantasies in any way, shape, or form, be honest?  No, never.  Because the man, well, let me tell you something. 
[00:26:00]  I've been raised in an atmosphere, like, you know, like, through the church and everything  to respect, you know, people who are in relationships and things.  And then, you know, if I have a crush on a guy, I know they'll see somebody with somebody  with a significant other married, a wall comes down, a game comes across, the boundary  is gone, I take a present in a different direction.  I can't size about single guys.  How do you can't even fantasize about somebody that isn't available in some way?  Patty, religion has F's you up.  Yeah, this is a perfect example of religion. 
[00:26:30]  The stuff that goes through my mind when I'm alone, there's no barriers.  Wow.  Well, I just wrote barriers, only cause of respect.  All right, but it's fantasy.  All right, well, Eddie, thank you for asking that question.  It's a big relief, eh?  Yeah.  Oh, by the way, I want to announce that I am, uh, I'm getting married.  Oh, thank you, Lord, my Jesus.  Just to make sure there's no, uh, no doubt in Patty's mind.  Oof, uh.  Uh, I'll be everything, everybody.  All right, Patty, so you get the urge.  Yes.  You're laying on that, uh, that infested mattress of yours. 
[00:27:00]  It is my sleep.  In that serial killer apartment doors.  Can you see every painful detail of my killer physique?  And, and what happens?  You're laying there alone.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  What happens?  I set the Brooklyn Niner up for grabs.  The phone program is intended for mature audiences.  What do I do?  Yeah.  Well?  Virgin.  I, uh, just, like, visualize, you know, like.  Okay, so you visualize, you get fantasy in your head. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  You visualize.  Right.  And then, what, what happens there to satisfy the urge?  Because you know where the urge is based around, you know what I mean?  Yeah, definitely.  It's a cynical urge.  Right.  So, what do you do to take care of that?  Well, I just, again, I visualize, like, maybe somebody, like, uh, an actor or a singer  or something I know.  All right.  And what are they, what are they doing in the fantasy that you have?  Name an actor that you have fantasized over.  Okay, I'm efficient.  Uh, which one?  I've had a crush on the edge for 15 years now. 
[00:28:00]  The edge from you, too.  Yeah, I actually love the edge.  I have a, you know, I've had a crush on his all the time because he's cute.  Hey, well, we got the edge right here on the edge.  What are you, oh, my God, what happened?  The edge just shot himself.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no, I just took some found, too.  By association.  Uh, Peg?  Yeah?  All right, so you're on your map, I assume, with a point?  Yeah.  Are you naked?  Be honest.  Well, I guess.  Yeah.  Yeah, baby. 
[00:28:30]  You know, I guess, you know, it's a fancy kid, it's a steal, and it's what makes it say.  Anise.  Anise.  Butt sex.  Anise.  You're a sexy boy.  You use your tongue for your own $20 or more.  You know, don't, you know, well, don't get me wrong.  I don't have a dirty mind or anything.  It's like a moran.  It's in the hole.  So, what do you, uh...  Oh, that's one of the sexy.  What do you do?  What do you think about?  What do you imagine the kids doing that satisfies some of these fancy? 
[00:29:00]  Oh, wow.  Taking love to you.  So, what type of...  What's the move?  Do you see a concert?  Do you see a backstage?  What's the fancy about?  Well, you know, it's a great vision going out with him and whatever.  You know, but it's only with sexy.  It's what happens.  It's your own man, eh?  Does the edge get out for some...  Well, no.  I like dinner and roses.  It's more like it.  Anthem, for the magic of radio.  Yeah.  You have entered... 
[00:29:30]  Sucker patties.  Fantasy month.  Right.  And I do believe we have audio of Kedge.  All right.  I smell lemon pudding.  Oh, my God.  All right.  So, now you're with Kedge.  Yeah.  He's making love to you.  Is it on your bed?  Familiar surroundings?  Is it...  Actually, I used to take myself out of familiar surroundings and myself in a hotel room.  It's hilarious.  All right.  So, you're in a hotel.  The edge.  And then, obviously, you're not just all of a sudden naked and making love the edge for you, too.  There's got to be kind of a set up. 
[00:30:00]  So, you're in the hotel.  What happens?  Because you don't drink or anything.  You're talking.  They start rubbing you.  Hey, everybody.  We're all going to get laid.  How does it pan out?  Well, it's pan.  You what?  Oh, my face is red.  It's like, you know, hugging and stuff like that.  Hugging.  A little rubbing.  You know, whatever.  Do you then, like, grab his junk or something?  How does the sexual part of this start?  Well, I would like to take the weight.  Yeah, so, and with that, I believe we have more audio from the edge. 
[00:30:30]  All right.  You're a little bitch.  That's right.  You're a bitch.  I bet you'll suck on you.  Wow.  Plus, you know, I read magazines like Cosmopolitan.  Cosmopolitan.  You know, I get a little excited at that, you know.  I'm not into romance-type stories, but I like reading about, like, situations and stuff, you know.  And I imagine some of the situations that I read out.  Uh, and?  Yeah.  Audio from the edge.  You're like too much in the bad room.  Is it true that, um, they wrote some bloody Sunday about you? 
[00:31:00]  No, this is that political situation.  All right.  I don't think so.  I thought a few days before, uh, urge.  Oh, stop.  Okay.  Well, you know, that's my mistake.  I'm sorry.  So now he makes first move.  What does he do to make first school move?  What?  Oh.  That's why we just go right into the bed.  That's wrong.  All right.  Into the bed.  Now you're, you're rubbing each other and touching.  And he's, he's, he's touching the, uh, he.  Does he start touching your, your, your, my parts?  Not right away, you know.  No, I know.  But we're up there. 
[00:31:30]  Like, like, like, one for a second.  So now.  Yeah.  Uh, you're naked.  You're in bed with the edge.  Yeah.  And you're rubbing each other.  And you're rubbing each other's little muddy part.  Well, yeah.  So, yeah.  So now since you've never had sex before, how do you imagine the act having sex?  Very gentle sweet.  But I mean, how do you even know what, what would be fun if you've ever had sex before?  No.  Have you seen it in pornographic movies, Patty?  Actually, within a while, I've spent a lot of curiosity. 
[00:32:00]  So you've seen, so you've seen the act, so you know what it looks like.  Well, I just, in the same way, my post.  So what is it, what is fantasy, your urge, and your body feel like when the edge plays one?  How does the edge take you, Patty?  Yeah.  Does he take from behind you, right?  Something to me that's pure missionary.  You got that right.  Ah, Patty on the bottom, edge on top, pulling a little cap off his own face.  Because I'm going to tell you, some of the decisions that he's picking up cosmopolitan,  I don't think I get into them.  Yeah, well, Patty, slow down.  There are wild decisions in cosmopolitan. 
[00:32:30]  Cosopolitan.  I understand how she bends over with that sweater ride.  Do you read that?  I'll have to satisfy you, man.  I've seen some of the weirdest things, like the table and stuff.  Oh, that's weird.  Yeah.  That's pretty, yeah.  That sucks when that happens.  So you're doing it with the edge of fantasy.  Very position, very position, and it's very nice and soft.  Now, just the image of your head and the fantasy can't be enough to satisfy you.  Your hands now start to roll a little bit, right?  Right.  Well, it's perfectly normal.  All the people, they touch themselves. 
[00:33:00]  They get into that.  It goes hand-in-hand fantasy.  So what do you start on your shoulders a little bit?  Just a rundown.  What's the rundown?  What's it like?  Well, you know, from like, you know, Disney and stuff like that.  Yeah, but what are you doing?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  Anthony, by the way, we have audio.  The edge.  The edge, again.  And I'm in the middle of having sex with Patty and Patty's football, right?  It sounds a lot like Psycho Mark. 
[00:33:30]  I didn't know we had your own Patty.  I'm sick of my mouth.  Patty, do you ever fantasize about that?  The edge.  No, I can't.  I'm still getting it.  It's going to be yucky.  The edge down in there.  Wait, what's got to be key?  The one.  I'm sick of my mouth.  She wouldn't imagine that.  The edge into a birthday.  Thanks for that.  No.  Over and over.  Patty, I want to know if you're petting the pool at this point.  Yeah, Patty, let's down to us tax here.  Has your hand ventured by your waist in this fantasy alone? 
[00:34:00]  You're at home naked.  You're sizing your hand now.  Go by the waist.  No.  I feel like I said I have a certain degree of honesty.  We're always here.  Yeah, see, yeah.  It does.  It does.  Vagina.  Yes.  You do the thru-shuffle?  How many?  Hey, Patty.  Just give me another one through five.  How many?  How many?  Just, you know what I mean.  How many?  Well, it's what I've seen on tape, but it's that I'm a lady. 
[00:34:30]  You know, it's nothing for me to talk about stuff like that, because I am lady.  You know something?  What?  Single hand ruined you for every listening out of it.  I believe you two wrote a song with Patty and Molly.  You think so?  Yes.  Sweetest thing.  Poussa!  Oh, my God.  All right.  That's a hot song.  Good, baby.  Very good.  That's a hot story, Pat.  Yeah.  And I think it's freeing to be able to talk old about your fantasy like that.  Yeah, but it's the worst thing. 
[00:35:00]  You know what?  Well, that's something you get out of.  Religions rip you up like that.  Hmm?  Anthony, you're having fun.  Anthony, you know what's strange?  After a story like the girl tells, I usually have a bathroom for a little while.  You want?  Yeah.  I can't get my junk.  Oh, he's a Canadian.  I can't get my announcement in times in fashion.  I like to make it now.  I'm all serious.  Yeah.  I am completely gay.  I have turned today completely homosexual.  Boo!  Boo!  I'm free!  Uh, on line 10, someone would patty over the...  What do you mean by that?  Well, look on words that went for... 
[00:35:30]  Uh, I thought they had a person or anything.  Oh, no.  Can I tell you something?  What?  Because I was brought up religion as well.  Yeah.  Uh, lady martyrs.  Instead of my church of worship?  Yeah.  Uh, patty.  What?  Because you had those...  Yeah.  You are going up?  Yeah.  Yeah, patty.  By the way, you're vertically in there.  You're a dirty boy girl.  No, I'm not.  Oh, God.  I just want everybody to get that scene in their head.  Patty on her bed, naked, diddling.  Gedge.  The thing is, the lady, expectations that I've got them. 
[00:36:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  What?  He's loved to beg, too.  Yeah, the people that they love.  Uh, I'm sure.  Uh, uh, wow.  That was, that was pretty gross.  And I would be for sure.  Daddy, come.  Daddy, come.  Daddy, come.  Daddy, come.  Yeah, yeah, that's fine.  You take it.  You do it now.  Daddy, daddy, come.  You're a little bitch.  You're a bitch like a sucker. 
[00:36:30]  Daddy, come.  Daddy, come.  Daddy, come.  Daddy, come.  Oh, okay, honey.  Hey, I'm pushing.  Who's that?  Daddy, come.  Daddy, come.  Don't say it right, is it?  Oh, my God.  Well, thanks, pal.  Yeah, pal, it was an hour of hot.  Hot, yo. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, Rich, what up?  Oh, God, you're killing me.  I hate you for six.  I'd rather have a bunch of niggas speak it and listen to the fuck up my mom on your cell phone.  Jesus Christ.  To the edge.  Oh, look at Joe.  I love when this is getting pissed off.  Oh, McCree, I had just cut it over there in England where the hell he is.  All right.  Back.  Do you go to questions still?  No, I have the shirt in like three years.  All right.  I don't want to save it.  Give it back doors to Jesus Christ.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  All right.  I don't want to do that.  I'm funny.  I'm like a very special.  Ah, shut up, that crap. 
[00:37:30]  I always had a backstage at the two shows.  I'm a real.  I just had to be here.  Frank, what's up?  For the love of God to shut up.  The thought of diddling her spoke makes you want to say junk in a minder.  The electric, the old hand crank.  The computer, I'm.  So I can get the maximum pain I can forget the vision in the freaking head.  I think you're going to do.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  That is true that a baby fell into your mouth hit and the unrallied blouse.  No.  Did it look mine shaft all boarded top labs in a real car? 
[00:38:00]  No.  All right.  I'm sorry.  All right, Pat.  Okay.  Oh, God.  This hand, I'm checking out TV music.  You two broken up in height.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  If you had the big, oh, it would probably blow like gold milk.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off. 
[00:38:30]  Turn it off.  Like it or not, this will be the most popular radio show in New York City.  The ONA show beats the hell out of my dad's old pornos.  One-two-seven-W-N-E-W.  Say better than that dad.  Unlock his face.  We need to gather more information about this new plant.  Don, you have a 16-year-old blonde daughter on the character of the resident.  Penny, you're here with me.  And Will, you brobo go out into the uncharted wilderness and take this mincing, boy-hungry pedophile. 
[00:39:00]  Be quiet, sir.  Oh, you're very naughty.  Yes, yes.  Sir, dear.  That was on Family Guy, right?  Family Guy.  Yeah, I was watching that.  That sounds good.  Well, I'm open-minded enough to realize that a lot of people over the years have goofed  on Lost in Space and the fact that Dr. Smith was banging young William or something.  You know, I'm not going to sit and cry.  Lost in Space never really happened.  Yes. 
[00:39:30]  It was all a fitment of imagination.  I'm not going to sit and cry.  Anthony, what's up?  I got to say, Regis today was the funniest thing.  Because this whole thing comes out with him, with some other chick like eight years ago,  and now he's just uncomfortable on his own show.  Yeah.  Oh.  You know why?  Because it's all true in the paper.  And he had to deal with his wife and everyone.  Oh, you know, he's denying it.  His lawyers are denying it.  Everyone's denying it.  But you know something? 
[00:40:00]  If it's in the paper like this, and this woman says she has her diary and dates,  and there's pictures of them together, I'm willing to leave it.  When you put yourself out there.  When you put yourself up there, you know, people, I can't believe it, Gelman.  They caught me.  Years later, they caught me.  I couldn't stand it.  Fantastic.  You know, when you're there with joy for so many years, and a voluptuous cheerleader comes  up, you got to bang her, Gelman. 
[00:40:30]  Who wants to bang a cheerleader?  I do.  Yeah, I know.  You know, Reed, she's got a hot little body on her, too.  You see the picture in the post?  My God, she's got some tans.  She's setting herself with huge, firm boobs.  Well, she put on a little bit of weight from her younger days, but it seems to have all  gone to bite.  She's definitely doing so, though, Anthony.  She's got like the big boobs, and there's Reed, there's a picture of him next time.  Ha, ha, ha.  Look, I'm laughing.  They didn't have it, of course, is what she's saying.  Which, I'm remembering now when the whole Monica Lewinsky thing went down. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  Went down.  With Clinton.  And they were talking about it on Live with Regis and Kathy Lee.  And Regis always looked a little squirmy as they were talking about it.  And everybody thought it was because, you know, Regis doesn't want to get really deep  into that kind of thing, and it embarrasses him.  But the truth of the matter is, he was in the same boat.  There's the married guy getting oral and giving oral.  It looks like they were doing a little 69. 
[00:41:30]  And saying that it isn't sex.  That's a visual idea.  And it wasn't cheating.  To have in my brain.  I love it.  I got buried my head in there.  I can't believe you're gumming.  You've got to move your head all around.  Get your face involved.  Come on.  My tongue is numb.  I know how to eat it.  Grab a hold of that there.  Now shake it like a pom-pom, you bitch.  Shake it.  Yeah, I guess she was, what, a cheerleading coach? 
[00:42:00]  It just says the buxom ex-cheerleader.  Maria Majarik.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Back in 1991.  Be aggressive.  Be aggressive.  Let's read some of her diary, shall we?  I guess she didn't do well on her SATs either.  October 27th, 1991.  I met him in his dressing room.  He was nice enough to take a picture with me.  There you go.  The first little encounter.  Mm-hmm.  And then a few days later, November 1st. 
[00:42:30]  Wow.  Oh, she says wow.  Ripping us off, Opie.  You wouldn't believe this.  Regis called.  He's so fun to talk to.  Such a Dahmer, I guess, Notre Dame fan.  That was only a couple of days later, so I guess she sent her phone number for him to call.  And they talked.  And then April of 92, a few months later, after a Notre Dame basketball team played in a New York tourney, he hissed me that day. 
[00:43:00]  Ooh.  I was startled by it.  I was both flattered and intimidated.  I was exhilarated by the fact of who he was.  I'm Regis.  Look at me.  I grab you and I'm going to shove my tongue down your throat, you whore.  Come on.  Suck it.  And then two months later, in June, after a trip to New York to talk with a publisher about a book on cheerleading. 
[00:43:30]  A book on cheerleading.  Wow.  We went back to his office, and before I knew it, he had his arms around me and kissed me.  It was great.  Yeah.  Suck it.  I love it.  Plus, he came in with those huge cans.  You see, Joy, she's a stick figure.  I need something with thighs to press against my ears, Gelman.  Rah, rah, sis, boom, stick it in my face, you whore. 
[00:44:00]  About four months later, after an October 8th football game in South Bend, as soon as I walked in the door, he was all over me.  I'm a madman.  Look at me.  I couldn't, I couldn't hold myself back.  It's amazing.  Defense.  No, she had none.  How could Ben, like, it's the Regis member.  You just want it.  I pulled out my junk.  She went at it like my c*** contained oxygen, and she was drowning. 
[00:44:30]  That old c***.  That old c***.  What's in the diary?  Uh, no.  No.  It says, uh, yeah, he was all over me.  We damn it thing two lovers can do.  Except intercourse.  It might say, but we were both married, and we felt we weren't really committing adultery if we'd have ador.  Oh, hello.  Well, come here.  Come in, come into my room.  I'll just get...  Oh, there you go.  Let me unleash this. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, yeah.  Little prison lube.  I learned that from Gelman.  Now, suck it, you whore!  It's okay, Joy, it's okay.  It's not intercourse.  For $32,000, what is sex without being intercourse and not cheating?  Oral!  Suck it!  You need a lifeline?  Here's one.  It's in my pants. 
[00:45:30]  And then after their last tryst in the fall of 93, wow, so that went from 91 to 93.  A couple of years, Regis got hold of me and told me, I'm in room such and such.  So I guess she went to...  We were very passionate, as always, and stayed together for hours.  He really made me feel like a woman.  All right?  Now, put two and two together there.  He made her really feel like a woman. 
[00:46:00]  Mm-hmm.  I do believe he's good at the oral.  Without intercourse, right.  Yeah.  Oh, you gotta dig it!  Can't be a fade, Gelman.  You gotta use it all!  Oh, I love it!  And you...  Love it!  You missed the best quote.  Where's that?  Regis had me strip naked and put my fur coat back on.  Where's that coat?  We made love.  It was pure, raging sex.  That sounds like intercourse.  Lots of kisses everywhere and very passionate. 
[00:46:30]  We didn't have intercourse.  Everything but...  But...  I'm like the gif.  I, uh...  I wanted to give her anal.  But I couldn't.  Because that would be wrong.  That would be cheating!  So I just dug in.  I dug in like she was a bowl of Captain Crunch!  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  You think he did blue when he was, uh...  Digging for the pearl?  I was digging.  Eatin' ain't cheatin'.  That's right, Gelman.  Eatin' ain't cheatin'.  Mmm.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
[00:47:00]  Let me get in the canyon here.  Hello!  Yodel-o-de-lay-hee-hoo!  Look at me.  I dive in headfirst.  I got my whole head in here, Gelman!  It's huge!  It's like a...  Booga-looga-loo!  I'm over here now!  Get me a snuckle!  I'll be down here for hours!  All right, bitch.  Now your turn.  Suck it!  Suck it!  All right, time to go.  Look what I did to you again. 
[00:47:30]  You cheerleader whore!  So it seems...  Who would think?  Could you picture that?  The girl's looking down and seeing...  How you doing?  Hello!  How's it feel?  Well, tell me!  Put on the coat.  You put on that coat, you whore.  Put it on!  Yeah, so that's why he looked kind of squirmy, I guess, when they would talk about that whole 
[00:48:00]  thing.  I wonder if Kathy Lee knew, and they talked about it.  Well, there's a couple other things in the story.  She also has in the diary Regis telling her how much she hated Kathy Lee and how she talked  about the kids about the kids.  Oh, really?  Hmm.  Well, that's a given.  So that's in there.  Well, I guess it is a given.  Okay, now get around back.  This is called the Rusty Trombone.  I love it!  I'm gonna...  I'm gonna...  Let me dig in here, and I'm gonna...  I'm gonna give you a thumb!  Is that cheating? 
[00:48:30]  Do you think both Regis and Frank gave anal to the same chick?  Kevin wants to know.  He took the back door, I took the front, and we played cards on a back door.  We're looking for a few good enemas.  What the hell are you talking about?  Dopey and Anthony Show.  Crap, whiz, and vomit.  1027 WNEW.  Greg Brady.  Hey, Barry Williams.  Greg Brady.  Barry Williams.  Greg, Greg, Greg.  May I have your attention, please?  Marcia, Marcia, Marcia.  I repeat, may I have your attention, please? 
[00:49:00]  Will the real Greg Brady please stand up?  That's me, of course.  Barry Williams.  Greg Brady.  Barry Williams.  Uh-oh.  We're gonna have a problem here.  Y'all act like you've never seen a real Brady before.  Belt bombs, polyester, hip bands, orange hair.  Was it firm?  Was it real?  Hey, who cares?  Here's the story.  Here's the story of a guy named me.  Greg Brady.  Barry Williams.  Don't you know we were the real that 70s show?  And oh, Alice O prepared Sam's meat for free.  You know what I mean.  It's the return of Johnny Bravo.  Wait.  No, wait.  He didn't just say what I think he did, did he? 
[00:49:30]  And Mike Brady said,  Nothing, you idiots.  Like Tiger, he's dead.  Oh, Cindy had a miss.  Greg Brady.  I'm sick of him.  Look at him.  Walking around, wearing his tiki guide.  Surfing and wiping out.  Yeah, but he's so cute, though.  He was cool for a while being a teenage star.  But now the Brady name can only go so far.  I'm doing stuff that's new, but Greg Brady, the Martians know it.  He goes on me as I'm loony.  All the other Greg Bradys are just irritating.  So if you ain't Greg Brady, please shut up.  Please shut up.  Please shut up.  Because I'm Greg Brady and I feel that sick. 
[00:50:00]  Brady, so stop your imitating.  Yes, I'm the real Greg Brady.  I grew up.  I grew up.  Please shut up.  It was so much fun.  Make that show for you.  Didn't write my book, too.  Telling you who to date and who.  It was all TV.  Wasn't real.  Just play.  Back then you'd say that the dad was really gay or that my mom on TV was dating me.  TV.  It was groovy.  Far out.  Out of sight.  But any night you light up a TV and then you just want to be trying to be Greg.  Just be sure you know there ain't no show without me.  Barry Williams, Johnny Bravo.  Greg Brady.  The Casanova.  Greg Brady.  Of Clinton Avenue.  Greg Brady.  I got A.K.A. in a suit. 
[00:50:30]  I dig M&M and Clark Bars, too.  I was the oldest kid and I was young and cute.  I would never do toot and I still fit that suit.  I'm here to stay and if you get in my way, you can cram it where there ain't no sunshine.  I'm Greg Brady.  It's not the real Brady.  All the other Greg Grady's are not syndicated.  So if you ain't Greg Brady, please shut up.  Please shut up.  Please shut up.  Cause I'm Greg Brady and I did ladies more than any big Brady.  I was slim and shady.  Cause I ain't Greg Brady.  Please shut up.  Don't suck.  Go up. 
[00:51:00]  I gotta get out of this anymore.  And how did I get stuck in this box in the upper right hand corner anyway?  I was a kid of rock when Kit Rock was just a kid.  And Uncle Cracker?  I was somebody's nephew.  And I got him cause something suddenly came up.  Whoa!  Whoa!  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony show.  Barry Williams in the studio.  The real Greg Brady.  We love when he's back. 
[00:51:30]  Stuff always happens when he comes by.  And today we have some stuff happening here in the studio that's a little different than we're all still.  Yeah, the penis puppeteers, Anthony.  The penis puppeteers.  I've looked at a couple of pictures of their work.  Their general.  And I looked at the hamburger.  Which is interesting.  That's what it was made out of.  The Loch Ness Monster though.  Come on.  The Loch Ness Monster looked like the photo of Nessie we've all seen in the books.  The iPower. 
[00:52:00]  And what was the other one?  Oh, the snail.  The snail's pretty funny.  Do you choose a hamburger thing by trying to excite yourself in a blender?  Actually, I don't know what they did.  They actually got excited because it would ruin their gig.  They needed to be.  Ours too, guys.  Yeah, really.  Exactly.  Keep an eye out on everyone's lap.  This is Robert Reed.  From the pictures.  From the pictures, it looks like they need a lot of pliability to their junk.  Like the hamburger, it looks like what they do is they take the main part of your junk 
[00:52:30]  and kind of wrap it, wrap it into a circle.  Then they take one of your yams from your yam bag, put it on the bottom,  and one hop to make the bun and then kind of press it down.  And it looks like buns with a hamburger in them.  And their website is linked at foundrymusic.com so you can see pictures.  Are you yours?  You can picture?  I don't know.  Well, at the worst, they have a website and we can do that.  Eric has a quick question for Barry Williams. 
[00:53:00]  Eric.  Hey, Barry, how you doing?  All right, man.  Hey, let me ask you a question.  Did you see that last Portrait family movie where you guys were staring each other down?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Did that really happen?  Of course not.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Ridiculous.  Can you pick up that little red-headed freak?  Yeah, he produced it, Danny Bonaduce.  But can you imagine Shirley Jones and the cast coming out, getting in a bus from Screen Gyms,  coming over to Paramount and calling us out on the floor?  Yeah, that's kind of silly.  I mean, people would like to see that. 
[00:53:30]  We were on the same network, same time.  You know, we would.  Right.  No.  Danny Bonaduce, though, normally tells it like it is.  Yeah, exactly.  Didn't he beat up Robert Reed after that episode?  Yeah, I think he did.  Yeah.  Remember the transvestites?  Oh, I see.  I see what you're saying.  We were talking about Robert Reed, you know, the father there, Brady.  After that, I remember him, the episode of Medical Center, I guess it was.  That's right, Chad Everett.  Yeah, yes, Chad Everett.  Chad Everett.  Medical Center.  And he played a transsexual, a guy going through an operation to become a woman. 
[00:54:00]  And he had a dress as a woman for the show, and I guess he was up for, what, an Emmy or something?  Yeah, an Emmy award for that, right, right.  And it just freaked everyone out, because you're used to watching him as Mr. Wholesome Brady.  I think that whole thing was so that he could just finally have himself.  Finally wear a dress.  You know, he could have himself.  Without a problem.  I am beautiful.  Look at me.  No one better than me, Greg.  No one better than me.  Greg, Peter, Bobby, I'm naked. 
[00:54:30]  I just wanted to let everyone know that lots of women are coming into the studio now to help us.  Thank God.  With the penis puppeteer so we don't feel as gay and attractive women are coming in here.  Thank you, I will add this.  All right, I think it's time for the penis puppeteers.  Oh, my God.  Time for some uncomfortable radio.  We got the girls in the studio.  Here we go.  Making their way into the studio.  David and Simon.  How are you guys doing?  You're from Australia?  Absolutely.  Mike, absolutely.  You guys got to share that, Mike.  All right.  No worries.  Two days ago, a sewer rig that'll hold that tanker. 
[00:55:00]  I like that movie.  What the hell did you just say?  That was a road warrior.  Come on, that was great.  Great movie came out of your country there.  Mad Maxway called it back.  Wasn't that great?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, the second one.  The first one was a little cheesy.  The second one was great.  And the third one was, you know, we don't need another hero.  Get out of here.  Tina killed it.  Did you guys watch the Brady Bunch growing up?  Absolutely.  If you told me ten years ago that I was going to be showing Greg Brady my knob, I'd never  would have seen it.  Right?  Imagine that.  You know, I can't wait till I tell everyone back home. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, great.  Thanks a lot.  Hey, let me know.  So, is this something that you do in the pub?  I mean, you know, you're out and you have a couple of beers in the United States?  That's where it all started.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  It's a very famous industry.  A drunken puppy.  Now we only do it in the theater.  In the theater, yeah.  Give us a little background.  How did it start and progress coming?  Go to a theater.  Watch you junk.  I started in the bath.  Yeah?  As you all did.  As a kid?  Yeah.  All right.  Now, who can remember in the bath?  And you would take your theater and go like, in the door one. 
[00:56:00]  Right.  Everyone has their own little one that they did.  Yeah, I did bat.  What was the first one?  I did bat wings.  You did the bat wings with the tumors in the...  What was your first one?  Well, I did...  Well, at that time, it was the little girl, but we now call it the woman.  Oh, where you just...  And everyone does it.  You tuck it down?  We call that the turtle.  But we've also got another one where we take it a little too far.  It's a little more graphic than just the tuck, I'm afraid.  Really?  Yeah.  Totally correct.  How does that work? 
[00:56:30]  Well, you might have to come to the show to see that.  Oh, gee.  Well, maybe I just won't see it.  You guys do it.  You have an actual show.  We're going to go there.  See?  We're living the...  Don't say they come there.  They just go there to watch the...  Right.  I think, man, dreams of traveling the world, getting his penis an hour and night and getting  paid for it.  All right.  I could see that happening.  It's totally non-sexual.  It's all for a laugh.  Are you coming to your show?  Oh, yeah.  Australia, it's mostly guys.  This started as a...  Well, I mean, as you guys know, it's a secret men's business. 
[00:57:00]  Mostly.  Now, that's...  Look at Jim.  He's the recipient, Ro.  I'd hate to think...  Because I can't have your lunch looking full.  Exactly.  That's funny.  So, you did that.  But how did you make the transition to just kind of doing it yourself and...  Oh, were you showing full?  Beer.  Beer.  Beer.  Beer.  Beer.  I think it's just been taken way too far.  And we did it for the Melbourne Comedy Festival back in 98.  And we actually did it as a joke.  And we go on a similar radio station to this with some friends back home. 
[00:57:30]  And we were going to get all the theatre critics in, expecting them to slam it.  And, you know, we're going to go, oh, this is outrageous.  Come on, it's art.  And they called us the outright best show of the festival.  And we've just been waiting for someone to tell us to stop it ever since, really.  So, what kind of fan mail do you get?  And who do you get it from?  Oh, no, we really don't get groupies in puppetry and penis.  Oh, the warm-ups.  Is that what that is? 
[00:58:00]  Sorry, we're being distracted.  I want to know from the girls that are in here.  Do girls like seeing men manipulate dolls in puppetry?  They're looking girls in books, you know.  Wow.  I think there's your answer, Barry.  You're happy with your size and everything?  You've got to be happy with what God gives you, really.  Right.  Have you noticed that using this fashion for so long has made it longer?  Well, yes, yeah.  But we don't like to say that too much. 
[00:58:30]  We don't want to see boys hanging themselves off the clothesline, you know.  Right.  Because, I mean, the more you do stretch and give it a bit of a tug, it does.  It becomes a little more flexible.  I've been tugging mine since I was 12.  And it doesn't seem to make a difference the way I do it.  Do you find that Asian men will try these tricks and give up in disgust?  Do it with paper.  Look, I met the dragon.  Yeah, watch what I can do.  Dave, what's going on?  What's going on, ONA? 
[00:59:00]  Well, we're hanging with the penis guy.  I know.  I actually hung out a little bit in Scotland for the Fringe Festival.  I got to see these guys.  They're phenomenal.  Great.  They had like a week's worth of shows.  I cannot believe the endurance.  They had these TV cramers and this big screen so everyone could see the audience sold out.  Dave, I've got to ask you.  Did you feel gay, though, watching this?  Did I feel gay?  No, not so much.  I'm a performer as well.  Right.  I'm not that kind of performer, but I can understand the artistry of it.  Okay. 
[00:59:30]  It was very cool, man.  I love you.  Barry Williams, is it true that in the episode of the Brady Bunch where a silver platter,  you had to pay for the engraving on the silver platter, instead of going songs with the girls,  that Greg, Peter, and Bobby were just going to manipulate their junk in front of their father  just to pay for it?  I heard a rumor about that.  It never made it to the air.  Damn.  Okay.  Because I did hear a rumor.  It's good just to flush those things out.  I would actually do a pretty good impersonation of Sam the Butcher. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, no.  Benjamin.  Bloody mess.  Hey.  Hey, they said they have to broadcast it on TV so the people in the back can see it.  Have you ever thought about making an IMAX version?  IMAX.  20 stories high?  20 stories high.  I hope that would be funny.  I wonder what an IMAX movie is.  Nice and large.  Oh, yes.  You love your big penises, don't you?  Yep.  Thank you.  So what should we do?  Should we take a break and then have them do a few trips? 
[01:00:30]  I guess so.  Ladies are...  Look, the ladies are all getting worked up about this, aren't they?  Hey, what do you think of that crocodile, honey guy?  Oh, he's not cute.  Yeah.  He's pretty popular over here.  Yeah, yeah.  We don't watch him back home.  I guess not.  He's just an idiot.  Take him off.  He's crazy.  Anyone who jumps in a pen with a crocodile has got something loose.  Right.  Don't let the kids watch him.  There you go.  Watch penis manipulation.  He goes and picks up snakes.  What's up?  Hello?  You're on the radio.  What's going on? 
[01:01:00]  I just wanted to say how much I love the book.  The book?  The book?  You got a book?  Yes.  I got the book.  It's an instructional manual, how to do them.  Oh, it is?  Yeah.  You doing what that is?  I usually...  What a conversation.  You might as well plug the book.  What's the book?  Yeah, that's called...  Well, it hasn't been released.  You can get it on Amazon.com.  Yeah, I got it over the internet.  Puppetry for the penis.  Yeah.  Puppetry for the penis.  Okay.  All right, Cheryl.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  And Lou's got a question about tickets.  Lou, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  I just wanted to know where I could get some tickets to see these guys. 
[01:01:30]  There you go.  I'm straight, though, dude.  Look, I'm straight, though.  Let me tell you.  I'm straight.  But I need...  But I want to pay money to see a man's penises.  I'm completely straight.  Telecharge.  Where are you guys playing and all that?  We're at the John Houseman Theatre on 42nd Street.  Okay.  How proud is John Houseman?  Oh, yeah.  I wouldn't doubt it, sure.  But, yeah, you can get the tickets from Telecharge, which is 212-239-6200. 
[01:02:00]  All right.  Thanks, dude.  We'll take a break.  We'll take a break.  We'll come back, and we'll penis puppet tree.  We'll whip it out.  Get it off.  You guys are going to see a few of those and go, oh, now I remember a few.  We'll all join in.  We'll all join in.  Gentlemen, do you guys do the bird bath?  Baby bird.  We do the baby bird, yeah.  Baby bird.  You can get a bath to yourself, sir.  All right, well.  We can all get in a circle and do it over a cracker.  That old guy, nice. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, brother.  See, ladies, we do stuff for you guys every once in a while.  We'll be back.  What kind of show is this?  It was like somebody pouring hot wax in your ears until your brain was completely numb.  The Alfie and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  And we're back with the OPN. 
[01:03:00]  Anthony Show.  In the studio, Barry Williams.  Yeah.  Here for Barry.  And Anthony, the penis puppeteers.  David and Simon.  Yeah. 
[01:03:30]  Yes.  From Australia.  And their penises.  They're going Lenny from Motorhead, don't they?  I love that look.  Just like him.  I see something going on there.  So.  It works.  Yeah, they're doing a show in New York.  You've got to give the info again because I don't have it in front of me.  Sure.  You can get the tickets from IntelliJuts.  It's 2123 9200.  Previews start tomorrow night and lots of cheap tickets.  And is that what theater?  It's a John Haasman theater.  Right.  I guess.  All right.  I guess.  And look at what's going on in there.  Ladies, are you guys ready to see some tricks? 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  Can we shuffle a couple of quick ones?  Hey, if guys get excited at any point, doesn't that ruin the gig?  It cannot happen on a Friday.  You can't.  It can't.  Right.  Because it's got to be pliable.  Well, the thing is, if there's 300 people laughing at your genitals, it's just never going  to happen.  I guess.  Just think of Nana.  Think of Nana.  That's a point.  I see a stalker Patty showed up, too.  I want to see some junk.  What do you want to see first?  I don't know, but Rick is in my way.  All right.  Back up so everyone can see.  Anthony, is stalker Patty in that new Michael Douglas movie? 
[01:04:30]  I'll never tell.  I'll never tell.  Look, they have an ant.  Does she have the body of an ant?  Looks like an ant.  Look at my thorax and my abdomen.  We're in Patty.  Okay, how are you?  Very good.  You ready to see some man junk?  Yeah.  When was the last time you fucking man?  I don't know.  I think Ron Jeremy.  You never saw Ron Jeremy.  You know Ron Jeremy?  Yeah.  She put her hand down Ron Jeremy.  Right.  I was like, I forgot.  Exactly.  That was the funniest thing.  She never saw it.  This girl lady thing has never seen a... 
[01:05:00]  I parked her car so I could listen to that.  It was amazing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When we had the U2 tickets and we made Ron Jeremy stick him under his yam bag and she  had to go grab and dig and manipulate.  She's a virgin.  She's a 45-year-old virgin.  She's never seen a man's unit and that was the first time she ever touched it and it's  Ron Jeremy's.  And she says the reason she hasn't touched one is she's waiting for the right person.  Again, Ron Jeremy was the right person. 
[01:05:30]  Practically.  She caught 20 diseases just touching it.  Yeah.  Hey, Mike, real fast.  I have this puppeteer's an idea.  Maybe they could stretch out their junk by hanging them from the swing set like Bobby Brady  in that episode.  No, Bobby was complaining that he was too short.  Did I read?  Yeah, I do remember that.  It's a fair fact.  I was in the dressing room banging Marma.  Brady Bunch reference.  Always funny.  Always funny.  Yes.  I'm just wondering if the puppeteers have any of the twist them out so they need four hands. 
[01:06:00]  Maybe Patty can get in there.  Some kind of a...  Patty can get in there with a couple of hands.  No one joins in to help you out, right?  We do.  And you don't manipulate each other.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,  Hey, I'm clearing.  We're not waiting.  You know, we've stalled enough.  All right, ladies, I'm very excited, ladies, about singing this.  Great.  Here they go.  They're going up.  Drop their...  They've got good cheeks.  They're working it now. 
[01:06:30]  They're stretching it out.  They're warming it up, man.  Warming it up, and then they will manipulate them into various shapes.  We're all going to have to do football right after this, you know.  Oh, my God.  What's the matter, Rick?  Rick, what's wrong?  This is a snile.  Here we go.  That is indeed a snail.  It's a...  I hate things in France, you know.  They're opposing.  One's going left and one's going right.  So, the...  I'm bagged.  Patty might pass out, because this is the first time she's ever seen... 
[01:07:00]  Patty, what's up?  Metal junk.  Very interesting.  Unfortunately, she now thinks that looks like...  The Eiffel Tower.  Play to the Eiffel Tower.  Oh, my God.  Rick, Rick, talk to the ladies.  Talk to the ladies.  You should have liked this now.  Wow, Rachel...  How about that?  The Eiffel Tower.  I have nothing to say.  I have nothing.  I have a question.  Do you play with these, and then come up with a shape, and then name it?  Or do you name it first, and then try and find it? 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, you play with it first.  Yeah.  But these have been around for a long time.  I see.  You've just perfected them.  Yeah.  All right.  Now, maybe...  And that's what you should guess.  Okay.  So, if you can guess which this one is.  It's a very famous mystery from around...  Right?  Together and McDonald's.  Oh, what is that?  Nessie.  That's Nessie.  I knew that.  This is so gay, man.  It's so Nessie. 
[01:08:00]  Looks like a camel, I guess.  A camel?  Oh, it's got two humps.  Right.  Could be a camel.  But it's the Loch Ness Monster.  Sure.  Right.  Very good.  You guys, you like the Loch Ness Monster?  Yes.  Okay.  The snail is hilarious.  Oh, it's the hamburger.  Oh, the hamburger.  Yes.  This was a favorite in the photos.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  The hamburger.  Look at them working in it.  I am afraid. 
[01:08:30]  All right.  The hamburger.  That is a meat of hamburger.  That is a big hit with the ladies.  Oh.  I...  Oh.  It's too old.  That looks like it would hurt a little bit.  Hey, check out my sesame seeds.  Check out my sesame seeds.  All right.  Don't get too close.  What?  Oh, instruction.  He's showing us how to make the hamburger.  Roll it under.  You've got to be sure that if they're not your ass, ask permission first. 
[01:09:00]  Right.  Wait.  Turn on the angle.  Ouch.  And then hold it.  Like a hamburger.  By the way, Steve is filming this for foundrymusic.com.  Do you mean factor or did it never hurt?  Guys can manipulate their...  I learned this on OPN.  Yeah.  Look at this.  Do your show.  Do you ask for volunteers from the audience?  One volunteer from the audience.  You do.  But I don't have to touch it.  And what is that?  Of course. 
[01:09:30]  I'll show you the baby bird.  All right.  The baby bird, Anthony.  The baby bird.  And just feed me.  Feed me.  What the hell is that?  What is that?  Hot dog.  Hot dog.  It's similar to the hamburger with more meat.  Oh, did you get the bird?  Yeah.  The baby bird is...  He pulls some skin around the top and works it like a mouth of a baby bird. 
[01:10:00]  That was very...  Can you do the other thing, George?  We do it in the show.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, we set our penises on fire.  All right.  There you go.  Now, does circumcision enter into that?  Can you do it?  Circumcise these?  Well, we're both circumcised.  We're actually, as we mentioned before, we're actually looking for new people to join our show.  New talent.  New talent, yes.  And we haven't had an uncircumcised person yet, so, I mean, that would open a whole new window.  Oh, my God.  Imagine the thing you can make.  Bring him on.  Imagine the things you can make with that.  Surely there's one here in New York City. 
[01:10:30]  Patty, what did you think there, Patty?  The Big Mac was interesting.  You like the hamburger?  She liked the hamburger.  She works at McDonald's, so she's never going to look at those the same way again.  I get all aroused when I look at a hamburger.  The baby bird is worth the price of admission.  That's pretty good.  That's hilarious.  I looked like a baby bird.  What is the windsurfer?  I keep hearing about the windsurfer.  Oh, yeah.  The windsurfer.  You just can't get enough, can you?  You may even give it to them. 
[01:11:00]  Thanks, Thorne.  They took their...  Oh, yes!  Oh, my...  That's...  That's all right, man.  That's all right.  Holy...  Look at your...  What are you doing to yourself?  Looks like a damn boomerang.  I'm a guy, and that's just like...  He called Rachel's cam bag.  It becomes a sale.  That was the most horrifyingly painful-looking thing I've ever seen in my life.  Wow.  Oh, you're a little taken aback at the size? 
[01:11:30]  Slightly, yes.  Really?  Yeah.  Wow, these girls are sweating.  See what happens when you tug on it like that?  Oh, yeah.  See?  Wow.  Mary needs some air, man.  Look at her.  Mary's thinking, what the hell, guys, have I been with if this is a guy just not even excited?  I just doubled my number today, man.  But I didn't eat like that.  You can make a boat out of it.  That's a big mule, and you can make a boat out of it.  Yeah, definitely.  And if you were black, we'd push Leon Klinghoffer off the side. 
[01:12:00]  Are you guys desensitized as a result of this?  Are you with regular snacks, or does it feel as good?  That works perfectly fine.  Thanks if you're concerned, though.  Oh, man.  You guys definitely don't have girlfriends or wives.  That's his girlfriend right there.  Talk to her.  You don't mind that he's showing his junk to everybody?  No, I don't mind.  She's so proud. 
[01:12:30]  He's been doing it for longer than he's known me, so I can't control the beast.  It's got a mind of its own.  Is he just like in the middle of the night, go, look what I did?  And all of a sudden, he's like showing you some new work or anything, no?  He's got his nuts up on the shower one morning and showed me the squash.  Oh, the stingray.  Went against the glass.  What is he doing?  He's going to do the squash rat.  Oh, look out, Rick.  What is he doing?  I'm wondering how they met.  Now, can she do anything special with her genitals? 
[01:13:00]  He's doing the squash rat.  He's doing the squash rat right now, man.  I see.  Squashed rat.  He's doing the stingray.  The stingray?  I think he's just wiping his...  Now, how many of these puppets can you make, roughly?  We do about 45 in the show, but we've got about 60. 
[01:13:30]  Wow.  Is it to music?  We used to work with a penis.  I think I'll go for a while.  It's a sunshine day.  We just got a penis on stage.  A penis.  A penis.  But basically, I mean, we have an expression back in Australia, I think, about the dumpers  again.  You can't polish a turd.  Right.  I think we seem to have polished a turd.  We did a season in the London West End, and then we had to start working with, you know,  like, lighting design and music and all that sort of stuff. 
[01:14:00]  But there's still a couple of guys making shapes out of their genitals, really.  Right.  All right.  Yeah.  Well.  But, you know, with a few Broadway frills.  I would not have believed it.  You guys do...  Absolutely would not have believed it.  You do kid parties?  By Metzvers.  By Metzvers?  Usually we can do most of the Muppets.  That's right.  Most of the Muppets.  You want to see Magonzo?  All right.  He's going to do Gonzo.  Let's be a Gonzo.  And this is...  Ladies, just don't describe, you know, what they're doing is, I guess, the problem they're 
[01:14:30]  having.  Here he is.  Too much description.  Buy me dinner or something first.  That is dinner.  How about just the money it would cost for dinner?  It's 30 bucks.  Hey, well, you know what?  Anything to pay for college.  All right.  Let's go to Diane.  Diane, what's up?  Hey, I'm from D.C., and this is the funniest bit I've ever heard.  You guys are hysterical.  Are they ever going to be anywhere else in the country?  Washington?  Washington?  Yeah, sure.  You want to get our...  Washington?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Diane, I don't know.  They're going to be in New York for a while, and then who knows? 
[01:15:00]  You never know.  Oh, this is hysterical.  The ladies appreciate it, and you guys are just cracking us up.  We'll bring him to one of our roadshows in a second.  Absolutely.  Hey, look, we've got four troops going around the world at the moment.  It's a franchise now.  We're franchising.  You look right.  So that guy who rang up before I saw us in Edinburgh was actually our second troop.  Right.  We're the original guys, and that's why we're here.  They're franchised.  They're all the cockatums.  Yeah.  Diane, I don't know what they dumped out of, but these guys have a website, and we took 
[01:15:30]  video today.  Steve's going to put it up on our underground website, foundrymusic.com, after the show,  all right?  So does this officially mean you're going from whip it out, whip them out Wednesdays to twist  them up Thursdays?  No.  No, no.  You know, I got to say something.  Yeah.  I'm going to take a beating for this.  I didn't feel that gay.  No.  You didn't feel that gay?  I didn't feel that gay checking this out.  Because they don't act gay.  They're men.  They don't act gay.  They're like guys.  They're just twisting their junk around.  Because it would be too bad if guys didn't check this out because they thought it was like 
[01:16:00]  a gay show.  It's hilarious.  Well, I've got to tell you, and it's the perfect show for men.  Men, this is the perfect first date show.  You bring a girl along.  She's like, get you home.  Go ahead.  Get them out.  I want to get my hands on them.  I want to make some shapes.  I want to make some things out of them.  It's a great first date show.  Breaks the ice, so to speak.  You forget they're mules after a while.  No, you don't.  After five minutes, it could be an elbow.  The windsurfer?  That didn't look like a mule, you know?  But then again, I've never seen a sailboat leak. 
[01:16:30]  Aww.  The awe from the crowd.  The awe from the crowd.  Barry, what did you think?  I am wowed.  I am stupefact.  You're a bit worried at the start.  I was a little worried at the start, but coming from Australia, I knew you were going to be  straight blokes, right?  I don't have any of those people there.  You're right, Opie.  It's not gay at all. 
[01:17:00]  It's just weird.  And that's just so cute.  That's just cute.  You want to kiss it?  No, no, no.  Barry, can you help clear up another rumor I heard?  Is it true that when Marcia couldn't get Davy Jones to sing at the prom, she was actually  going to get the penis puppeteers to go to Fillmore Junior High?  I was going to arrange that.  Really?  You're going to hook that up?  Yeah, I thought that was true.  Are you guys going to take the show on ice?  There you go.  I hope not. 
[01:17:30]  It's a smaller show, I'm afraid.  Oh, you know what?  That was all right.  It's David and Simon, the penis puppeteers.  Yeah.  Thank you.  And forgive me if we don't shake hands.  Yeah.  Give the plug again, please.  One more plug.  It's at the John Houseman Theatre.  Previews start tomorrow.  And lots of cheap tickets for the previews.  Get the tickets from Telecharge, 212.  2-3-9-6-2-0-0.  Thank you.  Come and laugh at our genitals.  There you go, man.  And Steve took a lot of video. 
[01:18:00]  It'll be up on FoundryMusic.com tonight.  And their website will be linked to FoundryMusic.com as well.  Okay?  There you go.  www.pubistryofthepenis.com.  There you go.  Thank you.  Fuck.  Wow.  Opie and Anthony.  God damn genius.  1027 WNEW.  Today I'd like to talk to you on a very serious note.  Because this is the story of a man overcoming monumental physical pain and suffering.  Because I went to the DMV today and it was really, really ugly. 
[01:18:30]  There's nothing funny about what you're about to hear.  Everything was organized.  I went in there.  That's such a part of just being like a man.  I am.  Is going to motor vehicle and registering.  Well, Anthony, I'm not a man.  Work with me, son.  So I get to the lady.  And I must say, the nicest DMV lady ever.  Ever.  She wasn't the problem this time.  The last three times, they were the problem.  All right?  So she's going through all the forms like, okay, we'll get you out of here in a jiffy.  Right?  And she's going through all the stuff.  And I'm like, all right.  Finally.  Fourth time going to DMV to get my vehicle registered. 
[01:19:00]  This is it.  I'm finally going to have New York plates.  Fools be told, today's world can be namby-pamby.  All of a sudden, she says, okay, I just need a copy of the title.  Is this the title?  I started panicking.  What to do?  What to do?  So I had to get the leasing company on the line.  This was the last time I went to send me the power of attorney, basically saying it's  okay to register the car in New York State.  All right?  Like, you would think that people, when they're sending that, would send a copy of the title 
[01:19:30]  knowing I'm going to need that as well, Anthony.  No, you can't expect them to do that.  So I don't have the title.  So now I can't do it.  So now I'm ready to go home, which means I'd have to go back to the DMV for the fifth  time.  No, no, no.  So then the lady sees the panic on my face.  She goes, look, can you get the leasing company to fax it over, the title?  Well, if I get a fax of it, boom, you're out of here in two minutes.  I'm like, no problem.  He realizes he's got to get it.  So I go out in the hall. 
[01:20:00]  It's key to the story that you know I only had 70 cents in my pocket.  I call the leasing company and I explain my situation.  I need the title faxed over to the DMV.  The lady says, I can't do that for you.  You have to talk to Judy.  Judy is busy with another customer.  You'll have to call her back.  Click, hangs up on me.  No, no, no.  I don't have enough money to call damn Judy.  So what do I do?  I drive all the way home.  He figures what the heck?  And I call Judy and I give her a piece of my mind.  I say, Judy, listen, you have to fax a copy of the title to DMV right now. 
[01:20:30]  Will there be a problem?  She says, oh, no problem at all.  Will you do it now?  She goes, yes.  I go, okay.  I am going to leave my house for the DMV.  I expect that title to be faxed when I get there.  That is beautiful.  All right, it gets better.  So I go back to the DMV.  Everyone knows now because I was there an hour before or whatever, okay?  I spend 20 minutes staring at the fax machine waiting for a copy of the title to come through. 
[01:21:00]  What to do?  What to do?  20 minutes later, it's not coming through the fax machine, okay?  He said it would not work.  After 20 minutes away in the DMV, I'm like, okay, there's a problem.  Now I have to make another call.  I don't have any change.  No, no, no.  So I'm at the customer service.  I explain, look, the lady was supposed to fax it 20 minutes ago.  I've been staring at the fax machine.  There's a problem.  I need to use your phone.  She goes, there's a phone in the lobby there or whatever, right?  I said, no, I have one nickel.  I can't make a call.  The lady, supposedly part of customer service, goes, you'll have to talk to a supervisor. 
[01:21:30]  His arm arose.  I go, it's a goddamn phone call.  Give me your phone.  Sir, you're building bridges.  You're making friends.  Now the real friendly teller heard me screaming at the lady, and she goes, here, and she hands  me a cordless phone.  I go, thank you.  And then I turn to the customer service lady.  I go, was that hard to do?  He got up and got one.  So I call the leasing company again.  I go, hi.  Remember you said you would fax it in 20 minutes? 
[01:22:00]  I've been staring at the fax machine.  Guess what?  Nothing is popping out.  Now, what's the problem?  Oh, I'll fax it right over.  I made a copy of it.  It was too light, blah, blah, blah.  I'm like, will you fax it right now before I come back in here with an automatic weapon  and shoot everybody?  And did she?  She did.  She did?  Fifteen minutes later, she sends it over.  You've got moxie, and don't let anyone ever take that away from you.  And then I paid my $72.50, so I wrote the check and I got out of there.  Young man, do you ever look back and wonder what would have happened if you'd just given up, 
[01:22:30]  if you hadn't followed your dreams?  I took five trips to DMV to get my license and my registration.  And I think we've all learned a lesson from this.  You've showed us that while no man is an island, the one man can make a difference.  And now I'm registered in New York.  Pretty cool.  I'd say you are very cool.  A very cool cat indeed.  Opie and Anthony.  Who would you rather nail?  I disqualify myself because I've done them both. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, look at that, weirdo.  1027 WNEW.  Hey, man.  Yeah.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:23:30]  Let's get this out of the way.  Get some phone numbers out there, and we'll move on with the festivities today.  We've got so much to talk about today, it's not even funny.  If you're thinking of not listening to us today, you're crazy.  Right.  Absolutely crazy.  All right, if you're in the New York area, give us a call at 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, 866-277-4WOW. 
[01:24:00]  What a night.  Well, last we left you, we were outside the VMA Awards.  Yeah.  At the Met here in New York City.  And things started heating up just as we were going off the air, right?  Yeah.  You know, we got there yesterday, I guess.  Way too early, by the way.  Yeah, way too early.  Way too early.  Like four, a little after four.  It was us and a bunch of really hot chicks taping TRL. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, and then the festivities didn't really get started.  The red carpet and all that crap.  Till, what, 630?  Like a half hour or 45 minutes before we went off the air?  Yeah.  So we got a few things in at the end, but for the most part, we were just tooling the retarded  Laverne and Shirley, who we brought with us to conduct the interviews.  Right on the side of the red carpet with the various celebrities that were going to the VMAs  last night. 
[01:25:00]  I've got to interrupt you really fast.  Reading the email before the show.  And most of the listeners absolutely loved yesterday's show.  They thought the Laverne and Shirley stuff was just outrageous and just over the top and  hilarious.  Right?  There were a few people writing saying, you guys completely blew it.  Why did you have those two retards interviewing the celebrities?  This was your chance to talk to a lot of these big wigs.  You never had big wigs on your radio show.  Big wigs.  What's the deal, guys?  You really blew it yesterday.  We got to explain something to you guys. 
[01:25:30]  We knew this was going to happen.  Uh-huh.  None of these celebrities stopped.  There was a whole red carpet.  Yeah.  We had our own section, which was just awesome.  Thank you, MTV.  And then to our right, they put the rest of the media.  We had our own spot.  Yeah.  We had our own little blocked off area where it was just our show.  Right.  And then next to us was where they keep cattle.  Everyone.  Everyone.  Teen Beat, Seventeen, Entertainment Weekly.  And they were fighting each other to get close to the rail that was right next to the red carpet. 
[01:26:00]  Meanwhile, we're right there.  Right.  They really hooked us up.  Let me tell you what happens at these things.  And I haven't been to many, but I have an observation.  Wait, wait, wait.  When you say you haven't been to many of these red carpet events, how many have you been to?  Actual red carpet events?  Yeah.  Events?  Yesterday was the first one.  One.  Exactly.  Me too.  We've been to some of these things like the Grammys.  Let's not forget the time we got kicked off the board at Spago in L.A.  Yeah.  At the Grammys. 
[01:26:30]  Because we weren't, you know, important enough to stand on a piece of wood.  We didn't rate to even look at the people that were going into Spago out in L.A.  When we were working in Boston, they flew us out to L.A. for the Grammys.  Yeah.  And we found out where the after-hour party was.  And one of the big ones was at Spago.  And they had bleachers set up.  We knew we couldn't get in, but we figured we'd hang out and watch who was going inside.  Right.  So we stood up on a piece of wood.  It was pretty much a two-by-six.  Top row of the bleachers. 
[01:27:00]  We were outside the actual bleachers on this piece of wood.  Because you had to go through some people to get into the bleachers.  Yeah.  So we didn't even figure we would get that.  No.  So we snuck behind and climbed up.  Oh, we weren't important enough to stand on that piece of wood.  They kicked us out.  Stand there.  Get off.  But we're Opie and Anthony, and we do a radio show.  Get off the wood.  But we do a radio show.  We're supposed to be here.  Look at our lemminants.  Our lemminants.  We didn't even have those.  We had nothing.  We stink. 
[01:27:30]  So, yeah, last night.  We were right there.  They hooked us up.  And we brought the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Because, like Opie says, these people aren't stopping.  They aren't stopping.  They stop when they, their publicist takes them through.  Every celebrity you see walking through with their posse, one of those people, at least one of them, is a publicist.  They scout out who's down the line.  If they see a photographer from Rolling Stone, and they know all these people, they will bring their person over. 
[01:28:00]  They will stand.  They will smile.  They will do that chick, turn their head around like Linda Blair shot so they can take the picture.  You notice that, how all the girls do that move?  They stand, and then they turn their head all the way around so they can get their face and their ass in the picture.  Perfect.  At the same time.  So their publicist knows that.  When the publicist sees the likes of us, they run block.  They completely run block on us.  Most of the publicists that were outside the VMAs yesterday, no sense of humor whatsoever. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  None.  Mm-hmm.  None.  The African princess publicist blew us off every single time.  What was the problem?  Your people can't have fun with us?  They didn't want their peeps coming over to us.  So we weren't going to sit there.  Should we read off the people that were at the VMAs last year and the year before and find out where they are today?  Right.  Go back a couple of years.  This whole thing has a short lifespan.  Yes.  And they're taking it way too serious. 
[01:29:00]  Come on up and have fun with us.  That's what we're all about.  No, they're very serious.  So this is the deal at these red carpet events.  Like you have the, I would say, like second-rate celebrities in general walking the red carpet.  Okay?  Mm-hmm.  Actually, there's three stages.  Yeah.  The celebrities that will stop and talk to people along the red carpet.  Okay?  Uh-huh.  Then you have the celebrities that will just walk the red carpet and make play.  Oh, hey, I would love to talk, but look, I'm late.  I got to get in there.  Right, right. 
[01:29:30]  Hey, oh, no, I'd love to.  Oh, they do the what, what, what?  Yeah.  Well, they point at their watch.  Well, they point at the door they're walking towards.  Right.  Like, I can't talk.  I got to talk.  The best move, and we have, I got to admit, we've pulled this one off ourselves.  What?  You act like you want to talk.  Yeah.  You act like you want to talk.  Like, wait, no, I got to talk to these guys.  Look, they're cool.  And then you have the guy that's part of your posse that has to be the bad guy and sweep you along.  And then you're left there like, look, shrugging your shoulders. 
[01:30:00]  Like, look, I'd love to talk to you, but look, he's pushing me in.  I got to go.  This a-hole is screwing up the program.  The celebrity had no intention of talking to those reporters, but that's how he handled it.  And third is the superstar.  Third, well, yeah, third is the celebrities that they're too good for the red carpet,  so they actually walk on the outside of the red carpet, on the other side.  Yeah.  Away from the press.  From where the media and the press is.  I never knew this before last night.  You would think the red carpet's the red carpet.  That's where all the big celebrities come in. 
[01:30:30]  No, there is a tier of celebrity that is better than the red carpet.  And if they're walking down the red carpet, to their right, the whole red carpet's fenced in with the red velvet ropes and whatnot.  To the right of those velvet ropes, off the carpet, is a walkway that the likes of Janet Jackson walk on.  You know, the upper echelon of celebrity.  Right.  And that's it.  We think Britney Spears walked by us.  We're not really sure. 
[01:31:00]  I swear to God, she ran by with two huge black guys.  I'm tired.  Leave it alone.  Over her.  Right.  They were over her.  They were smothering her.  It looked like a rape.  I think I caught her calf.  Yeah.  I think we saw her calf.  So they weren't stopping.  So getting back to why we even went this way on the conversation.  This was the only way to do this.  Yeah.  We weren't going to stand there and be humiliated by having these people just blow us off.  Right.  They're blowing off the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Who cares?  What would you rather hear?  Ant and I on the red carpet making fools of ourselves going, Janet, Janet, Janet, can 
[01:31:30]  we talk to you?  Janet, Janet, Janet, Janet, Janet, Janet, Janet, Janet, Janet, Janet, Janet.  Jackson, Janet.  All right.  There she goes.  Mick, Mick, Mick Jagger.  Mick, Mick, Mick.  That was Mick Jagger.  But we do a radio show.  It's sick, it's sick, it's sick.  Wait, can we talk to you?  We would have sounded like tools yesterday.  Bigger tools than we normally do.  Yeah.  Instead, we brought you the retarded Laverne and Shirley, and they did a great job.  I love those tools.  They get blown off.  I really love those tools.  Oh, yeah.  Love them.  No, hey, hey, shh. 
[01:32:00]  Don't say that.  I know.  I mean, we abuse them pretty well, but you know what?  They did the job for us yesterday, and they should be applauded today.  I can't stand them, but they do a great job for us.  So that was the reason we did that, because we knew we weren't going to talk to anyone really  that bad.  No.  The people that stopped were the ones that were desperate, that needed some press.  Mm-hmm.  All right?  Anyway, lots of email coming in.  And the Washington Post wrote about the VMAs?  Yeah.  I want to thank Scott Fabian, it looks like. 
[01:32:30]  Scott writes, ONA, I was listening to the debacle at yesterday's VMAs.  Too bad you couldn't have pulled more airtime.  Oh, no.  We taped from 7 to 8.  We got audio out the A, right?  Yeah.  That we're going to play for you guys in a little bit.  That is awesome stuff.  There's an article in today's Washington Post about the show, the VMAs.  Don't bother reading the entire article, but I think your girls made the paper.  Please see the highlighted piece at the end of the article.  So you go to the end of the article in the Washington Post today.  Yeah.  And this is us, by the way. 
[01:33:00]  Fortunately, there was plenty of room for P. Diddy to make a grand entrance on an 18-wheeler.  Alien and Farm played on a stage near the fountain, while television reporters  frantically tried to figure out who was famous and who was just extremely thin.  The questions tended to focus on clothing, even when the clothing was utterly pedestrian.  One reporter asked a member of boy band O-Town where he got his outfit.  This is a T-shirt from SeaWorld in San Diego, he replied, a little bewildered.  That was our girls, man. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  I think that was Marion who said that.  That was our girls, making the Washington Post.  Our girls.  Ugh, could you not put it in that way?  Look, I know they did a great job.  It was a lot of fun, but this affection you're getting for them is frightening me.  And I really, um, I don't want to go that way with it.  I feel like a proud, um, bus driver.  You know, like the guy that drives a short bus around and one of the special kids with 
[01:34:00]  the hockey helmet does something a little special.  Yeah?  You kind of feel good.  I don't know.  You feel good about yourself.  I still like wrapping them in the side of the head with their hockey helmet.  I still like jamming on the brakes and watch them fly their drooled face into the back  of the seat.  It's like, you know?  It's like, oh, look, they tied their own shoes today.  Eh, three loops per shoe.  But look, they did it.  You feel proud.  Right.  Okay.  They accomplished something.  I feel good today.  I'm with you on that, but...  Can you put it in my backpack, please? 
[01:34:30]  Uh, Aaron, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hi, man.  I want to see you guys.  I know you guys did it before the show.  Did you guys actually see the show?  Well, we're going to get into all of that, man.  Triumphly insult comic dog?  Uh, we just watched the show in the back office because we ended up going inside.  Uh, all of...  Well, it was Ant and I, Rick, Ben, and our security, our personal security, Keith, the cop.  We got to...  Your entourage.  ...in his best Miami Vice wear.  Right.  Fair laughing.  We got to ask Keith what we can and can't say because I don't want to get him in trouble 
[01:35:00]  with his job.  But, uh, so we went into the show.  Um, we saw U2's, uh, performance.  That was it.  Yeah, that's all we saw.  That's all we wanted to see.  The rest of the time was spent outside the, uh, actual, uh, the place where you watch the  show.  Right.  Uh, in the bar areas, the various bar areas.  And that's where everyone is.  The, the, the celebrities, they barely watch this thing.  You know, there's the people that are nominated and stuff.  They watch to say, you know, they might have to accept an award. 
[01:35:30]  But for the most part, everyone's outside drinking.  Yeah, the place was set up where you could just leave and there's just a huge bar and  a huge hangout area.  There's a few bars.  Yeah.  The, the downstairs bar, no one was going to.  We'll get into all the stories in a little bit.  But that's what we were doing.  We were just hanging.  And we were doing what's, uh, called stick and move.  We'd go to this area for a while, see what's going on.  Okay, nothing's going on here.  Let's go upstairs for a little while.  Okay, nothing's going on here.  Ooh, look who just passed us by.  Ooh, he looks pissed.  Ooh, wow, his new chick is really hot.  Okay. 
[01:36:00]  All right, nothing else to see here.  Let's go back downstairs to the bar.  That was good.  Hey, guys, one more thing.  Yes, Aaron.  You guys sounded great raw last night on Ron and Fez.  Well, we didn't even know that we were on.  But that was the best part of it.  All right.  I hope it sounded okay.  It did.  Thanks, Aaron.  Later, guys.  All right.  I just want to get through a few of these and then we'll, uh, talk about what we saw, um, during the show.  Okay?  Yeah.  Let's go to John.  John, what's up?  Yo, over there.  Yo, what's up with Chris Walken?  How many times did he say wow, wow, wow? 
[01:36:30]  Wow, wow, wow.  I think we had that.  Hold on a sec.  Wow.  Wowie, wow, wow, wow.  Did he look like he was about to panic?  Huh?  I thought he was about to panic.  Yeah, he didn't say much up there.  I won't read your cue cards.  Hey, he walked by our position on the red carpet and you got to hear what, uh, Lady Dian Marion said to him.  No way.  They're such, you know, they are asses.  Uh, they, they were just out of their minds. 
[01:37:00]  Thanks, John.  All right, you're doing great, guys.  All right, bro.  They were very starstruck, by the way.  The retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Very starstruck.  And, um, they're not professional.  They don't know how to do interviews.  So all they're doing is yelling at these people.  And the second, uh, a lot of these people got a little inkling to come over.  They would look at them and run for their lives.  Right.  A lot of people were scared off.  And just giving them weird looks.  Hey, Mike, what's up?  Guys, yesterday was brilliant. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, that was, it was, it was hilarious.  You know, it was like, it was like the regular guy gets to go to the big party and, and retarded Laverne and Shirley.  It was hilarious.  Listening to you guys laugh so hard, and I was laughing, might have been, you know, next to Mario Cantone.  I think that's about as funny as you guys get.  It was brilliant.  It was, besides it being a lot of fun, it was just cringe radio at its best for us.  Because, because they were getting themselves into some crazy situations, and, uh, Ant and I just wanted to crawl away.  I honestly couldn't watch. 
[01:38:00]  We had nowhere to go.  We had nowhere to go.  We would bend our heads down.  One time I ducked under the table when, when they were talking to Dale Earnhardt, Jr.  How, how, how are you?  Who are, who are you?  Who are you?  I'm Dale Earnhardt, Jr.  Who?  Who?  What do you do?  Dale Earnhardt, Jr.  Oh, I'm sorry I hear about your father.  That was beautiful.  It was, it was hilarious.  And I'm a, I'm a publicity guy.  I'm, in fact, I'm the guy you guys tooled around when I was trying to get Gutenberg on the air.  Yeah.  And let me tell you something.  You're right.  They, they, they've got to just calm down. 
[01:38:30]  I mean, who do these people think they are?  I think it's great.  If I had seen you guys and I was walking, I might have lost the client, but I would have brought them right over.  I think you guys were brilliant.  It's just weird.  I mean, just because you're a celebrity and you're a big name, that means you can't have a little fun.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Oh, please.  But it was brilliant.  Keep it up, guys.  You're getting better every day.  Oh, thanks.  You know what I had to do when they were doing a lot of the interviews?  We were standing up on chairs so we could see who was coming to alert the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  All right, here's who's coming.  Right.  So we were behind them and elevated. 
[01:39:00]  Right.  Now, a lot of the people walking by couldn't tell the difference between the regular press area,  which was crammed with different news organizations and whatnot, and our area.  So they didn't know that the retarded Laverne and Shirley were with us.  We're in the same area, but we're kind of back behind a table.  So I actually took my mic flag off, the thing that has the radio stations' calls on the mic,  so they would not think I was with them.  And as they're talking, I swear to God, I wasn't even looking at them talking to them. 
[01:39:30]  I wanted to distance myself from these two retards talking to these people because it was embarrassing.  Yeah.  It was really embarrassing.  Who are you?  Who are you?  Who is that?  I like it.  What are you wearing?  Mario Cantone.  Hold on.  Wow, this is going to be a party today.  I saw them, too.  The view you watched?  I was at the party last night.  Which one?  Oh, the big one.  Yeah, that's the one you say.  You know, the big one.  The big one.  Well, there was a wrap party for Sex and the City at Park last night on 10th Avenue. 
[01:40:00]  And then they tried to kick everybody out at 1130.  They were like, okay, the MTV party's coming to get out.  Like, we're going to get out.  Right.  We're from Sex and the City.  So, me and my lovely friend Kim Cattrall and Darren Starr and all these people, we all went upstairs.  And they let us in.  But they wouldn't let some people in.  Really?  They wouldn't let the executive producer, Michael Patrick King, who was the brain and the creative force behind that show.  They pissed me off.  That hurts.  I pissed.  It was like, please.  It was ridiculous.  So, since they didn't let him in.  They did that to me in Sag Harbor. 
[01:40:30]  I just did a big benefit with Alec Baldwin.  They wanted $45 for me to have a drink at the bar.  And I was like, slack my b**** now.  And I turned around and walked away.  And they came back to the hotel.  Oh, we can get you in.  I was like, I don't care.  I'm taking you personally.  I'm staying home and watching myself on A.J. Benza.  So, which I canceled.  So, anyway, I went upstairs.  And, yeah, we went upstairs.  We were at the party.  Mario.  What?  Sorry.  But we just got less about your great view.  Of course.  Oh, girls, girls, girls, girls, girls. 
[01:41:00]  Kimmy.  Oh, my God.  Look at it.  Now that Kimmy's not.  Kimmy.  Kimmy from Survivor.  Kimmy from Survivor.  Kimmy from Survivor.  I want to play Twister.  Now that she's not as famous, she's now flashing no problem.  You notice that, Anthony?  Kimmy's massaging me.  Kimmy from Survivor.  Kimmy.  Oh, Kimmy.  She's from Survivor, reality TV?  Never watched the stuff.  How you been, Kimmy?  Survivor 2, Australia.  Survivor 2.  She wouldn't eat the meat.  Honey, I don't care.  She wouldn't eat the meat.  Well, that's what, uh...  The occasional tube stick is acceptable. 
[01:41:30]  Oh.  Kimmy, you're very caricavicious.  How weird is it that Kimmy won't eat the meat, but Mario will?  Oh, of course I will.  Get your balls out.  Kimmy will eat the meat.  That mouse could fit a D-Train.  Hold on, hold on.  I'm sorry.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Look at the mouse.  That's huge.  I know the mouse.  That's huge.  We can't say that.  Wait.  It's as wide as Minnie Mouse is.  It's Minnie Mouse's heel.  Isn't that good, though?  Yeah, it is.  So we know you eat the meat.  Wow.  Get your tube stick. 
[01:42:00]  Take a chop now.  Hey, we could have a little reality TV war today, because we got Mike from Real World New  York outside, too.  Oh, really?  Well, is he...  I just went right back to buy him.  Yeah, and that's John Valby, who has to leave in like 10 minutes.  John, I'm...  John.  Where are you going, Johnny?  A long guy would be...  No, Johnny, come back.  I knew I'd wait for you.  John, you know John Valby, Mary?  No, hi, John.  Dr. Dirty?  You never heard of Dr. Dirty?  I'm bad.  I don't...  I love Dr. Dirty. 
[01:42:30]  And I'm a dirty girl.  You are.  You're sure.  Can we see your boobs again?  Oh, God.  Yeah, you didn't give us a good flashing through the window.  We got the prison visit.  Is she really showing us her breasts?  Wow, yeah.  I just saw her breasts.  Yeah, yeah.  Catch your...  Lick your...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, I can't say that word.  Yeah, they get a little...  They get a little off when...  No, I'm sorry.  Tell me, because I don't know the new rules.  ...these descriptive things.  All right, tell me.  I can't say...  Marion, we are responsible broadcasters, even though 2020 Downtown doesn't think so. 
[01:43:00]  I apologize.  It's me.  It's not them.  I have the potty mind.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  All right.  All right.  The listeners are going to kill us if we don't play the clips from the retarded Laverne Shirley  from yesterday.  Yes.  We were on the red carpet yesterday, Mario, and we did a whole show from there, and things  started heating up as we had to go off the air yesterday, but we taped from 7 to 8 last night,  and we got some priceless clips of celebrities.  Awesome.  See?  Look at how close we are to the red carpet.  See?  Oh, my God.  Look at you.  Who's that? 
[01:43:30]  They're right.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Some big, scary black guy.  I don't know who it was.  It's part of P. Diddy's posse.  I just like the P. Diddy.  I love saying that word, P. Diddy.  They're a few, like, P. Diddy and J. Lo and Janet Jackson that have the hugest entourages.  They just, like, they walk, a bunch of people walk by, then you see them, and then a bunch  more people walk by.  I wouldn't want to travel with all that luggage.  Yeah.  I mean, it would just, well.  We have to talk about Anne Hayes later, too.  I got a list.  Oh, my God. 
[01:44:00]  Other things.  We got to talk about Michael Jackson.  I'm going to see him Monday night.  Liza Minnelli singing with him.  I got a lot to talk about.  Let's get to it.  Take a break.  All right.  We'll take a break, and we'll definitely start playing the clips.  They're going to kill us, Anne.  I'm telling you.  We'll definitely.  I'm telling you.  Also, the pictures are up on WNEW.com.  1027 WNEW.  Bringing your ass back to the greatest city on Earth.  It's Ramen Fest with New York Forever.  Sunday night, Jay Moore brings his filthy clean tour to the Beacon Theater at 74th and Broadway. 
[01:44:30]  Tickets available at the Beacon Theater box office.  Just call 212-307-7171.  Proceeds from the show go to the fire department fund, engine number one.  Wow.  This is a big time.  Jay Moore appearing in the Beacon.  So, Fez, you're going to be appearing in Mario Cantone this weekend.  Nuh-uh.  We're not like that.  We're Ron and Fez.  For New York forever on 1027 WNEW.  Now, the station for sports guys, Don and Mike, Opie and Anthony, and Ron and Fez is this station. 
[01:45:00]  1027 WNEW.  New York.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Own it road, baby!  Yeah, sure.  1027 WNEW.  I do the party like my name was Elmine.  Well, I've been hanging out, drinking, and I'm not good enough to be that's a kid.  What's up, kid?  You know what's doing?  I may not try my own house party, cause I smell like a cane.  Well, I know I'm not the one you thought you knew back in high school.  Never going, never showing up what we got to. 
[01:45:30]  I'm such an every play.  Don't tell us to behave.  I'm sick of always hearing us to rage.  I don't want to waste my time.  Become another casualty.  I'm just lying.  I'll never fall in line.  Become another thing to love.  Just before we run into that town.  Hey, we're back with the O&A show.  Mario Cantone in the studio.  He's playing Carolines in New York, Sunday night at 8 o'clock.  A bunch of us are going to that show, Mario.  I'm so thrilled you're coming.  I promise you that.  Hey, are you into the Sum 41? 
[01:46:00]  Oh, I love the Sum 42.  Is that them?  How about me?  I'm so bad with the white boy groups.  I'm sorry.  Really?  Yeah.  Except for the Coldplay.  Yeah, you like the Coldplay.  This is Fat Lip from Sum 41.  You like the Fat Lip?  I love the Fat Lip.  Kimmy has Fat Lips.  Kimmy's got the Fat Lips.  She has beautiful Fat Lips.  Kimmy, you look really horny.  Are you all right?  When was the last time you had some of that?  You know what?  Because the season just ended, so now I'm ready. 
[01:46:30]  What, the F season?  No, the period season.  Oh!  The planning season just ended, so I'm ready.  The time of the month?  You're ready to go.  I'm ready.  What kind of birth control are you using?  You take the pill?  I'm cycling, just like every other girl.  Yeah, you take the pill?  Yes, I do.  Are you, do you have a long-term boyfriend, or you just kind of play the feel?  I'm dating.  You're dating?  I'm dating.  Do you, do you consider yourself a sexually compulsive woman, or do you, that's a interesting  term.  Oh, she's a nymph, man.  Look at her.  You like sex.  I definitely do. 
[01:47:00]  Well, I'm glad you like it, and I'm glad you admit it.  Yes, I do.  Yes, I do.  As a woman, I do not deny.  She wanted to keep her virginity until she was 14, so she practiced.  No, no, no.  She wanted to keep her virginity.  Okay.  And when, well, explain, you, using the proper terminology.  Well, this is what happened.  While all the other girls were beginning their sexual experiences having sex, I decided to  put it off, so instead I just opened it up and said, ah, and you know.  Right, so she would.  Oh, you mean.  She would, ah, I don't know.  She would give it sex.  She would give it that way instead of having sex. 
[01:47:30]  Yes, I was orally enhancing, and it turns out that that increased my property value.  You know, we have to bring this up.  When Rolling Stone interviewed us, the guy from Rolling Stone, we were talking about  our Boston days, right?  Yeah.  And he goes, Boston is a hilarious city when it comes to women and sex.  There's a lot of women that go to the colleges in Boston, and they want to remain virgins,  but they will give up the balloon knot.  The back door. 
[01:48:00]  The back door.  This guy, the guy from Rolling Stone swears by this.  Because they're still virgins.  Can I ask you when this article, because it's coming out, this article?  We were in the hot issue that was out a couple weeks ago.  It's fabulous.  Yeah, it's pretty cool.  That's great.  We're just a little blurred.  Hey.  It's not even worth that.  Let me tell you something.  It's only going to escalate for you, so get ready.  We found that funny, that the girls, they, you know, they want to be virgins while they're  in college, but they'll give up the back door.  So they can say that they're virgins still.  Oh, boy.  The guy swears by this.  We're like, come on, you're pulling our leg.  Well, you know, for a gay guy, that's breaking the cherries, so, you know, she's maybe a 
[01:48:30]  virgin in the front, but not on the back.  Knock, knock, knock.  You had yourself a bite, your front door, and shut tight.  That would be, that would make it easier, I think, for the girl, because usually they  go, oh, you know, I heard it hurts the first time.  But after giving up the back first, it's like, hey, geez, this is like nothing, right?  It belongs here.  Let's go to a clip.  Yeah, let's play some of these clips. 
[01:49:00]  Come on, I want to hear some of these clips.  The set-up, Anthony, really fast.  Went to the VMAs last night, Video Music Awards, MTV.  I was at the party, the big one.  Yeah, lucky you.  I snuck in.  We didn't want to do the interviews ourselves, because, quite frankly, getting blown off by  these people by the red carpet would be very embarrassing.  Because they blow off everybody.  Yeah.  So who did your interviews?  The retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Marion and Lady Di.  Show them a picture of the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Did they dress up?  Shirley, let me find them.  We wanted them to, but they didn't.  The pictures are up on opieandanthony.com. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, wait until you get a load of these two.  There's Marion.  I can know why I'm not with these people.  There's Marion, and there's Lady Di.  And they did the interviews for us.  Here's another little picture.  They look like drunk.  And they're not shy.  They look like the very suburban, short haircut, hockey mom kind of butch dykey kind of thing.  But even though, obviously, they're just suburban housewives.  No, they're like yin-yang people or something.  They're yin-yang party, yeah.  Yin-yang party.  That's their saying, yin-yang party. 
[01:50:00]  How about that perm on Marion?  She looks good, though.  Everyone was commenting on her perm.  She's a delight.  So now, they obviously...  You die today.  I'm going to jump over and strangle you.  All right, come on.  Let's get to the clips.  All right.  They obviously have no experience at doing interviews.  And not only that, it's not just like taking normal people with no experience.  They are completely retarded.  Right.  They can't put together a thought.  They can't shut up. 
[01:50:30]  They just babble and babble.  Right.  And they don't know what they're talking about.  They are retarded.  And, yeah, the action started heating up after we got off the air at 7.  And so, this is what we taped after the show yesterday.  It starts with Alicia Keys.  She was...  I saw her open for Maxwell.  She was phenomenal.  She's so talented.  Oh, yeah?  And she's an incredible live performer.  It's much better than a CD.  Well...  She's really talented, this girl.  Well, we have an 18-second interview with Alicia Keys.  Let's hear it.  Okay.  I love her.  I love her.  Here's...  Hey, Alicia Keys. 
[01:51:00]  How you doing?  Alicia Keys.  How you doing?  Come here.  I want to ask a couple questions.  I like your outfit.  The look on...  They do a double or sometimes triple take looking back at them.  Well, there you have it.  That's all we got.  We didn't really have to from her.  You didn't mean anything with her.  Well, we didn't have success with Alicia Keys.  That's because somebody called her Missy Elliott first.  How do you confuse those two?  No, no.  Missy Elliott wasn't going by just then.  I'm surprised they were going,  Elias, you're back.  I mean, you're terrible. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, well...  That's terrible.  They might have came out a little strong and scared off Alicia Keys.  Oh, you'll notice they scare off quite a few people.  So, all right.  The next person that came down the red carpet is Little Moe.  You know the Little Moe?  Little Moe.  You know, I have to say things.  Some of these rappers have some...  I think they're very kind of gay names, like Nelly.  Does he realize?  Fabulous.  Hello?  Fabulous.  Come on.  Fabulous.  Putting the word ghetto before it doesn't make a difference.  Fabulous.  And then Little Moe. 
[01:52:00]  I was called that many times in the United States.  Oh, my God.  Well, here's the Retard of the Verge Shirley with their 25-second interaction with Little Moe.  Okay, Little Moe.  Little Moe.  Hi, how are you?  Hi, I'm Mary.  That's Diane from the opening answer to the show.  Hey, that's a nice outfit.  It's a fat outfit.  Where'd you get it?  That's a nice outfit.  Now, who do you want to win it for best group?  Me.  Best new artist.  Me.  Okay.  Okay.  She wants to win.  All right.  Anybody else? 
[01:52:30]  No.  No.  Okay.  All right.  I wish you a lot of luck.  Thank you.  Best of luck to you.  Best of luck.  All right.  Holy God.  Let him speak, Little Moe.  Couldn't get a word.  Me.  Me.  That's a fat outfit.  That's a fat outfit.  That's a fat outfit.  So's her perm.  These ladies have never met a celebrity before.  They have no clue who these people are or anything.  They weren't nervous at all.  They just went with it.  It gets so much better.  Look at all the people they had interactions with.  Okay.  Who are we seeing next?  All right.  This is when Nate Dogg came by and they thought they saw Kato Kaelin. 
[01:53:00]  No way.  Kato Kaelin, we should say, was not at the VMA.  No.  But they thought they saw him in the middle of this Nate Dogg interview.  This is actually a little longer.  We got a little something out of Nate Dogg.  Oh, did we?  Yeah.  This is the retard of Laverne Shirley.  Check it out.  Excuse me, sir.  What is your name?  Nate Dogg.  How are you?  Excuse me.  What's your name?  Nick.  Nate Dogg.  How are you?  Nick.  Hi.  How are you doing?  Okay.  That's what I felt.  I got to ask you one question. 
[01:53:30]  What is it?  Who are you hoping to win?  Best group?  Best group.  Best.  Who's nominated for best group?  I have no idea.  You tell me.  That's information I'm waiting to hear.  Okay.  All right.  That's a nice outfit.  Nice hat.  Where'd you get it?  Nice sunglasses.  Nice sunglasses.  I had to make one of my friends.  Nice years, too.  Woody Wilson.  Okay.  Nice outfit.  I wish you a lot of luck.  Well, thanks a lot.  Okay.  All right.  What do you sing?  Hey, Kato Kaelin.  What's my Kato Kaelin?  What's your name?  She just blows him off. 
[01:54:00]  She blows off Nate Dogg because she thought she was on Kato Kaelin.  Nate Dogg was still talking, and she just yells out, Kato Kaelin.  It doesn't get much bigger than Nate Dogg at the VMAs, and she's excited because she  might have seen Kato Kaelin.  They make Joan and Melissa look like Barbara Walters and Hugh Darrell.  Oh, yeah.  The best part, Ben was right next to them, and every time the interaction, we can't even  call them interviews, ended, Ben would go, oh, I'm so sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I really have to apologize.  I got to pop the picture up just so I can get the visual. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, the visual.  The one doing most of the talking, the little blonde hair troll.  Yeah.  And the one that's just like her yes man, the big one here, Lady Di, who I say should  also use that as a verb.  Hey, hey.  Hey.  Lady Di.  All right.  All right.  You want to hear Will Ferrell?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That should be interesting.  Yeah.  This is good.  All right.  Hit the tape.  Hey, Will Ferrell.  Hey, Will Ferrell.  Hey, Will Ferrell.  Hey, Will Ferrell. 
[01:55:00]  How you doing?  How can I ask you a question?  Come here.  We're waiting for you.  Hey, nice shirt.  Tic-tac-toe, buddy.  All right.  How you doing?  Hey, nice shirt.  How you doing?  Like the earring.  Nice pants.  He's goofing on.  He's goofing on.  He's goofing on Marion.  What?  He took time out to goof on Marion.  Nice glasses.  That is so damn funny.  Yeah, Will Ferrell walks by, and he's wearing this, like, checkered shirt kind of thing.  Hey, nice shirt. 
[01:55:30]  Tic-tac-toe.  And Will Ferrell turns around, looks at Marion with those spectacles on.  There are spectacles in spectacles.  Mario is speechless.  I cannot believe it.  And he has nice glasses.  Now, wouldn't you rather hear this than Ann and I getting blown off?  Well, I don't think you would have been blown off.  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, we would have been.  You're O and A.  I'd rather hear this, though.  The funniest thing is that Marion is just screaming things.  Will Ferrell, how are you?  And Lady Di's just thinking she's at some kind of a dinner party or something. 
[01:56:00]  Hi, Will Ferrell, how are you?  How are you?  As he's just looking like they just crawled out of a spaceship.  He's looking at them.  Unfortunately, it is radio, and I cannot stress the fact that all these people,  they would hear the screaming, turn their head, look at these two,  and the look on their face was just, oh, my God, how did they get in here?  Yeah.  And Marion, the publicist, none of them had a sense of humor. 
[01:56:30]  A lot of them started blowing us off because, oh, we don't want to be a part of this.  Trying to run blah.  And we had the perfect spot on the red carpet.  They had the rest of the media all corralled, crunched together, and we had wide open space.  So we looked like we were a real special thing.  As much open space as you could have when the retarded Laverne and Shirley are in it.  Yeah, it looked like you had a special thing until they saw Marion Edith over there.  Edith from New Jersey.  You want to hear the interaction with the Backstreet Boys?  Oh, yeah.  We've got to do that one.  Oh, Backstreet Boys.  All right, here we go.  Hey, Backstreet Boys. 
[01:57:00]  Hey, Backstreet Boys.  That's pretty much it.  Hey, you, Backstreet Boys.  Hey, come here, guys.  Backstreet Boys.  I'm going to answer for you.  Hey, we're from the Backstreet Boys.  I'll be the end of the show.  Hi, guys.  Hi, Backstreet Boys.  How are you?  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  I can't believe I know their names.  What did she say was hanging out?  She is one of the girls that we're walking with, one of them.  She goes, hey, your boobs are hanging out.  I don't know if we have it, but at one point, Marion goes to one of the girls. 
[01:57:30]  You know the look with the hip huggers with the underwear sticking out on the back?  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, you have the thong that goes above the hip huggers.  So you can see it.  Let's see.  There you go.  There's the look.  Look at that.  Right?  Isn't that a hot look?  It's a very hot look.  But that's the same thing with the, you know, kicking it with the homies with the boxes up  the air.  Right.  Right.  Exactly.  One of the ladies walks by with that look, and Marion goes, hey, pull up your pants.  Your underwear is showing.  Pull up your pants.  Your underwear is showing.  Pull up your pants. 
[01:58:00]  Like she's doing him a favor.  You got to watch out.  Pull up your pants.  Can you see Joe?  Joe is going out.  What are you wearing?  Joe Boxer?  Your pants and your ass is hanging out.  Pull up, Melissa, who do you have?  You got Nellie?  Fabulous.  Oh, you're fabulous.  It's so fabulous.  Melissa, who do you have?  Mother, fabulous.  Fabulous.  Everything's fabulous.  No, I'm talking fabulous.  No, I have fabulous.  You're fabulous.  It's fabulous.  Aren't they awful?  Oh, God.  They're the worst.  We hate them.  Melissa, who do you have?  Nellie?  I'm so Nellie right now. 
[01:58:30]  You want to play a couple more before break?  Oh, hell yeah.  We have so many.  I got the picture up right in front of me, so I'm almost there.  I feel like I'm there.  When I hear that Marion babble, a lot of these are the celebrities walking by us really fast.  But there is some of these where they actually interviewed them for a while.  Yeah.  This is the group 741, right?  741.  Who wrote 741?  Oh, 741.  Of course.  Okay.  741. 
[01:59:00]  Because they say that.  All right.  741.  Oh, okay.  Hi.  Wait.  Because they say.  Yeah, I'm like, what's that?  Okay.  It's 741.  Come here.  All right.  741.  Hi.  Why not?  You look like a bike.  We look like a hair.  We look like a hair do.  It's beautiful.  Did you see that?  Hey, yo.  Come here.  I'll answer a couple questions.  You look like a bike.  You know, your hair has to gel.  Okay.  What happened to you gel?  You need to move. 
[01:59:30]  Hey, yo.  You need to shave.  He's just criticizing me.  You need to shave.  Is she spitting on them or she's talking?  I want to know.  Yes, absolutely.  You need to shave.  She has a tongue, like one of the big tongues you see at the supermarket, sticking out of  her mouth, and she's got that list.  Wait, she can't even talk.  Where's I got sort of a kind of a brain?  This is her.  We were goofing on her one day, and she goes, I have sort of a kind of a brain, she was trying 
[02:00:00]  to say.  I got sort of a kind of a brain.  I got sort of a kind of a brain.  I got sort of a kind of a brain.  All right.  You need to fire them in no time flat.  We love them.  You need to get rid of them.  This is just, I can't believe, this is like a psychedelic trip with a little bit of quaalude  mixed in.  It's very strange.  I'll tell you this much.  We entertain everyone that works for MTV.  Oh, they loved it.  They were all standing there watching.  They were standing there watching, just laughing at these people. 
[02:00:30]  But as we move forward, it's the band O-Town.  Hey, O-Town, come here.  I want to ask you a couple questions.  We're from the O.P. and Anthony show.  Hi, how are you?  What's up?  Hi.  We'll ask you a couple questions.  Who do you want to win besides you guys?  We're not up for anything tonight.  Okay.  What do you have?  You're not up for nothing?  You don't sing?  We're here to watch a free concert.  We're from the O.P. and Anthony show.  I'm married.  I'm here to watch the VMA's free concert.  That's what it is.  It's a combination of all the best artists of the year, the biggest artists of the year.  Okay. 
[02:01:00]  You know what?  I like, I don't know who's up, really, but I like Incubus Drive's new album, new video a lot.  Who's the guy standing behind you?  This is Dan, my friend Dan.  This is my friend Ashley.  Hi, how are you?  How are you?  Hi, how are you?  Stupid friggin' lady died.  Hi, how are you?  Hi.  The next one is Brian McFadden.  Yes, yes.  Brian McFadden from MTV. 
[02:01:30]  New York will remember him as Alter Boy on Cain's old night show.  Yeah.  When you watch him on MTV and you see it's Brian McFadden around the country, you just know him as Brian McFadden.  Here, he was the sidekick of Cain.  Right.  Before Cain got cabby.  But he wasn't really allowed to talk on that show.  They kept his mic really low.  Yeah, they wouldn't let him talk.  And he really had zero to add to Cain's show.  Zero.  And then he got picked up by MTV.  God bless him. 
[02:02:00]  What the hell do you know?  But we would not let him get away with being called his real name.  We told the retarded Laverne and Shirley to just refer to him as Alter Boy, his radio name.  And here we go.  Hey, Alter Boy.  Hey, you a tool.  How you doing?  How are you?  Good.  How you been?  Hey, you're a tool.  My radio name.  That's awesome.  Hey, you're a tool.  Hey, who do you want to win?  Who do I want to win?  Yeah.  Michael Jackson.  I can't do it.  I can't do it.  I can't do it.  I can't do it.  You guys.  When are you going to have some talent? 
[02:02:30]  That's too funny.  That's all right.  We'll go to the Open Anthony Show.  Wait.  Come on.  We'll go to the Open Anthony Show.  No, I don't remember that.  Hey, what happened to your hair?  What happened to your hair?  Hey, what happened to yours?  Something happened to yours.  All right.  I'm drained.  That is too friggin' much.  I am drained.  Hey, tool.  Hey, you tool.  Mario, we have another 30 of these.  To be continued on page 69.  Hey, you tool.  When are you going to get some talent?  Hey, you tool. 
[02:03:00]  You're tool.  Tool.  Yeah.  Calling people tool.  That's great.  Oh, I have mercy.  We definitely have to take a break.  We're just getting started.  On the way, we have Will Farrell walking by the second time.  Dale Earnhardt Jr., which is just, oh my God.  Yeah.  Fat Boy Slim and up next, Ja Rule.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Oh, sorry.  Yes.  Can you play that one more time?  Please.  Yeah.  You know something?  We might want to do that one more time.  Just play it into break.  Hey, you tool. 
[02:03:30]  How you doing?  How are you?  Good.  How you been?  Hey, you're a tool.  My radio days.  That's awesome.  Hey, you're a tool.  Hey, who do you want to win?  Who do I want to win?  Yeah.  Michael Jackson.  I can't do it.  I can't do it.  You guys.  When are you going to have some talent?  That wasn't too funny.  What's up, man?  Hey, we're from the O.P. and the Anthony show.  It's a fight.  Remember when we almost started?  We're from the O.P. and the Anthony show.  I don't remember that.  Hey, what happened to your hair?  What happened to the hair?  Hey, what happened to yours?  How did something happen to yours?  The wisdom, the wisdom of O.P. 
[02:04:00]  Of O.P. and the Anthony.  Unprotected sex good.  Cigarettes very good.  1027 WNEW.  Annie, you're okay.  You're okay.  You're okay, Annie.  Annie, you're okay.  You're okay.  You're okay, Annie.  Annie, you're okay.  You're okay, Annie.  Annie, you're okay.  You're okay, Annie.  You're okay, Annie.  Annie, you're okay.  You're so jealous.  You're too okay. 
[02:04:30]  You're outside of a window.  Bitch, you're a person, you're ready.  And if you're all a-bombin', with a-bust face, on a carpet head.  And then you ran up to the bedroom.  You were struck down.  You were swarming.  Annie, you're okay.  You're okay.  You're okay, Annie.  Annie, you're okay.  You're okay.  You're okay, Annie.  Annie, not daddy.  You're okay.  You're okay, Annie.  You've been hit by.  You've been struck by.  A smooth criminal.  And we're back with the O&A show. 
[02:05:00]  Mario, you've got to be into the alien ant farm.  I love the alien what?  Alien ant farm.  I love them.  Smooth criminal?  But the Michael Jackson original is pretty great.  I'm going to sing him Monday night.  Oh, yeah?  And guess who's performing with him?  Who?  Liza Minnelli.  What the hell is it?  That conversation must have been like, Liza, I want to do a medley of You Are Not Alone  into Over the Rainbow.  She's like, I don't sing my mother's songs.  It tears me up.  But please, for me.  Okay, I'll do it for you, Michael. 
[02:05:30]  And she's going to get up and be like, You are not alone.  She's not going to know the words.  Call me on the phone.  Leave a message at the tone.  You are not alone.  Can I call you on the phone?  I thought she was in the hospital.  Liza?  No, she's doing really well.  She's lost weight.  She looks great.  She's got to be wearing a very good jewelry.  She's like the new Liz Taylor to look at as far as the weight gain and the weight loss.  I bet she loses it again, though. 
[02:06:00]  She goes up and down.  Call me on the phone.  Liza, those aren't the words.  You are not alone.  Liza, stop.  Call me on the phone.  Leave a message at the tone.  I am all alone.  Liza, those aren't the words.  I don't really care.  Fix my pretty hair.  All right.  Also in the studio, we got Kimmy from Survivor 2. 
[02:06:30]  Lady Di wants in here.  Lady...  Lucy, I'm home.  Oh, Jesus.  I heard everything you said.  What?  Mary Cantone, I love you.  I love you, ladies.  And John Dalby, by the way, I love you, too.  So, Lady Di, what's up?  You had a good time yesterday?  We had a great time yesterday.  Yeah.  We had a wonderful time yesterday.  Yeah.  And, you know, whenever you want to call us, go ahead and call us.  We'll do the same thing over again.  Whatever you want to do.  All right.  Thank you.  No problem.  You added a lot to the show. 
[02:07:00]  Thank you, Lady Di.  I thought I told you to shut up.  Hey, Paul.  Paul was hanging out with us on the red carpet yesterday.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, yo, what's up, man?  I'm kind of feeling bad that Lady Di is listening because I just wanted to call in and make fun of them so bad.  They don't mind, my head.  Do what you got to do.  No, I mean, they're nice people, but even the celebrities, they're like the big ones.  Who are you?  Oh, who are you?  Yo, yo, yo.  They were calling like, city high.  Yo, Cisco.  Cisco, come here.  Oh, Cisco.  All right, Paul.  Thank you.  All right, thank you. 
[02:07:30]  We're moving a mile in a minute here.  Cisco, can I ask you?  Cisco is kind of Cisco.  Really?  I don't know.  Cisco is a little.  Cisco is such a, I don't want to get into it.  Can he sing the thong song?  Oh, please.  You can, I can't.  I shouldn't even say anything.  Shut up.  We got to play clips of the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Let's get back to some more of these clips, all right?  This is funny.  Anthony, let's set up once again.  We're playing the clips from, we did the whole show from the VMAs, from the red carpet,  and we had the retarded Laverne and Shirley, Lady Di and Marion, doing the interviews for us in their inimitable retard style. 
[02:08:00]  And this is all stuff you didn't hear because the action heated up after we got off the air yesterday.  So here they are interviewing or interacting with Ja Rule.  Funny, man.  How are you?  Michelle, I'm married.  That's Diane.  Me too.  Okay.  Who do you want to win?  Envita.  You guys.  You're an artist.  That's it.  Okay.  You know, we ought to come up.  I'm a new artist.  Hold on.  Ryan is trying to put my point to the world.  How old are you?  No, it's late.  I'm doing so late. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, I know.  You're young anyway.  Where'd you get the outfit?  I like it.  The outfit is very nice.  Actually, it's a sign from me.  Accept the shoes.  I'd like to get an outfit like that.  Yeah.  I'll drop my figure a little bit.  I'll have that gem and I'll poke you out.  Okay.  Very good.  I just wanted to let y'all know that I'm working on my album.  It's almost finished.  It's titled La Dolce Vita.  It's coming real soon.  It should be out in January or February.  Right.  We'll be looking for it.  Your baby got fat.  That's right.  Baby. 
[02:09:00]  Baby got.  Baby's critique.  I don't got that much fat.  Yeah, we know.  We can see.  We know.  Okay.  You're good.  You're good.  You're good.  You look good.  You're from the Opie and Anthony show.  Thanks.  I wish you luck.  Good luck.  Good luck.  Good luck to us.  Who was she with?  Oh, my God.  Who were they talking to?  Who was that?  It was Vita.  Ja Rule was with her, but didn't really speak up.  Vita?  Yeah.  New artist.  Vita.  You know who Vita was?  Vita was Joan Crawford's daughter in Mildred Pierce. 
[02:09:30]  Vitamin and Vegemite.  Vita.  I'd rather cut off my hands than hit you like that.  Vita.  Vita let go of me.  The girl didn't have an ounce of fat on her.  Okay, can I?  She said, I think she meant to say baby got back.  Yeah, she did.  But she goes back.  She goes, baby got, baby got, baby got fat.  Baby got fat.  Baby got fat.  That's fat.  And she was nice back.  She's like, I don't have any kind of fat.  I don't have much fat on her.  I want Vita.  This girl's going to stick her finger down her throat.  I know.  You just turned her into an anorexic.  I love what you said.  I want to prove my point to the world. 
[02:10:00]  And your point is?  And what about talking about her outfit?  I need an outfit like that.  A lady died.  I need an outfit like that to show off my figure.  She has an ass like a Lego.  I swear to God.  We were looking at the back view of both of them.  Yeah.  We were looking at the back view of both of them.  They were wearing these smart slacks.  You know, kind of one of those little outfits.  And Lady Di's ass is square.  She has a Lego square ass.  Let's put it this way.  She has one of those asses that she has to wear a belt so you know where the butt begins. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  It just goes.  There is no curve of a spine.  So the Lego being just like a lot of bumps there, too?  Is that what you're saying?  Well, I didn't look that close.  And the pants were a little looser.  But no, then it could be the Rubik's Cube ass.  Whatever square object you want to put in there.  Because Legos have those ridges.  Right.  So that represents the cellulite and the imagery of what you were talking about.  You know, it was good imagery.  It really was.  We've got to get through a few more of these because on the way is Dale Earnhardt Jr., which  is priceless.  There we go.  But first, here's the retard of Laverne Shirley as Fatboy Slim walks by. 
[02:11:00]  Hey, Fatboy.  Fatboy.  Hey, who?  Hey, Fatboy.  Fatboy.  Hey, Fatboy.  Yay, yay, party.  Can I party with you guys?  Can I party with you guys?  Can I party with you guys?  Hey, what are you doing later, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  Like they would go, hey, you get her.  Look, I just walked the red carpet.  I came in the door.  I know I've got to get to my backstage area, but I've got to tell you something.  I saw a chick on the red carpet to my left that wants to party with me. 
[02:11:30]  You've got to get her name because I need to party with this effing troll.  The sad part is they're dead serious.  I know.  The sad part about it.  Yeah, these girls hung out.  They hung out since the early 80s.  They've been friends forever, like Laverne and Shirley.  And the battle cry used to be, yin-yang party, because I guess people told them they were  like yin and yang.  They would always be together.  So they would all go around back in the early 80s to the turtle races at various pubs.  That was their exciting nights out.  And say, yin-yang party and drink. 
[02:12:00]  So now they're trying to bring it back, I guess.  Yelling it to celebrities.  Maybe one of them will pick it up, right?  Right.  Yo, man, yin-yang party.  Yin-yang party.  Could you imagine that?  You start seeing it show up on a watch show.  It's going to stick.  Yo, yo, yo, yin-yang party.  You're the person daily, you know.  Yin-yang party, dude.  TRL, yin-yang party.  Yo, man, first, I'd like to thank God.  Yin-yang party, you know.  All right.  This was a nobody VIP walking the red carpet. 
[02:12:30]  Who is that?  Hey, yo, guys.  How are you?  Hi.  How are you?  Nobody.  You guys don't look like nobody.  How come you guys get free IP?  She's just bashing people for having better asses than she has.  MTV people walk by.  They had to yell at everybody that walked by them.  Hey, MTV.  Thank you.  What about yesterday?  We had the interview, the woman that was vacuuming the red carpet before everybody walked  on, and she's like, you've got to take the vacuum bags. 
[02:13:00]  It's not working.  She's giving her household hints on how to vacuum the red carpet.  Oh, I cannot.  You need vacuum bags.  Wait, we do have that.  What is that, Eureka?  We have that clip from yesterday, Anthony.  We are now listening to the sounds of the vacuum that is cleaning the red carpet here  at the VMA.  And Opie Horovitz, listen to that, Opie.  Opie hates vacuum.  That is the very vacuum that is cleaning the carpet here, folks.  How exciting is this?  Vacuum lady. 
[02:13:30]  What kind of vacuum are you using?  What kind of vacuum?  Miss, what kind of vacuum are you using?  It doesn't work well.  It looks like you need a new vacuum.  Yeah, yeah.  I agree.  Look at it.  I mean, it looks really big.  You need a new vacuum cleaner.  They've got to get you a new vacuum cleaner.  Like she needs this.  Hey, did they use it?  I'm picking up.  The woman's all of us.  She's trying to do her job. 
[02:14:00]  Picking up anything.  She needs a new vacuum cleaner.  Lady Di, talk to the vacuum lady.  She does need a new vacuum cleaner.  And she went way on the other side of the carpet, too.  She's got to come back, though.  She's vacuuming concrete.  She needs a whole bag.  When you're done, you've got to change the bag.  The bag will work.  They're flying all over the place.  Maybe she could use your pad to soak up the dirt with.  Marion.  Tell her you prefer the Hoover.  I like Eureka. 
[02:14:30]  I like Eureka.  I like Eureka too.  And living.  That's a Hoover.  She's at living.  Wow.  She's not good with the prom.  Yeah, yeah.  She wants to follow her own path.  Tell her the Hoover.  It's Eureka.  I like the Eureka.  I like the Eureka.  We really thought we were going to have to help these two ladies along, because we didn't  know.  And we realized very early on, just let them go.  I hope she was using a wet vac for all the spit that was flying out of Marion's mouth.  We have to move on fast here.  Will Farrell, passing by again.  It's the retarded Laverne Shirley.  Hey, how are you? 
[02:15:00]  You're out of here.  It's the Cheser Chep guy.  We want to do an interview with you.  Hey, it's Cheser Chep guy.  Pick Pat Powell.  Yeah.  Are you a Polack?  Love those cats.  Put the pants.  What are you buying at?  The bargain basement?  Are you a Polack?  The best interviewers ever.  Are they?  This is great.  Will Farrell walks by again with a very colorful Czech design shirt.  And she goes, hey, are you a Polack? 
[02:15:30]  That's nice.  The girls are smart.  Yeah.  They're really in town.  Are you a Polack?  All right.  All right.  Who's next?  Two more before we take a break.  And it really heats up after the break.  Lincoln Park, what they asked them.  They had an actual interview with them in tech for the real world.  A lot still to come.  But this is Andy Dick.  Good.  Andy Dick.  I don't have to do this.  Andy on the radio.  Andy, hey, news radio.  Come on, Andy.  Hey, Andy, come here.  Let's interview you. 
[02:16:00]  Let's interview you guys.  Let's interview you.  Who is the hot chick of Andy Dick?  Andy Dick, news radio.  I love that.  You mean the beard?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  I was just going to say that.  That is a nice.  What happened to Paulie Shore?  What?  Andy Dick walked in with a tall, leggy blonde  that he just had no interest in whatsoever.  Wait, guys, something.  He should just shut up and be gay. 
[02:16:30]  Because he's a tortured, unhappy, suicidal, talented, successful man.  And he's miserable.  Yeah.  And it'll at least take a little heat off of him.  Just shut up and go for the crotch.  Shut up!  You know what?  If you're a gay guy and you want to walk in with a chick to make people think you're not gay,  at least walk in with a girl that looks like real women.  Yeah.  They walk in with, oh, he's got the supermodel.  Like, they go way over to the other end and pull out these... 
[02:17:00]  It's ridiculous.  It's very...  Cyber hot chicks.  He's ridiculous.  Don't get me started.  Him in hand.  Ann Heche, that other one.  Don't get me started with her.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  All right.  Well, Dale Earnhardt Jr. is next.  All right.  There was interaction between the retired Laverne Shirley and Dale Earnhardt Jr.,  Janet Jackson, Lincoln Park Tech on the way.  Is there another...  Mick Jagger.  Bump in with Will Ferrell?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And also...  What kind of show is this?  It was like somebody pouring hot wax in your ears until your brain was completely numb. 
[02:17:30]  The Alpi and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  And gentlemen, from Late Night with Conan O'Brien, it's Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog.  How you doing?  How you doing, everybody?  How's it going?  Hello, MTV!  All right.  All right.  I'm here to talk to you all about the Viewer's Choice nominees. 
[02:18:00]  Yes.  Wonderful groups like Destiny's Child and Insync.  You know, I'm a very big fan of Insync.  But then again, but then again, but then again, but then again, I eat my own crack.  I kid.  I kid in sync.  I kid.  Right, Carson?  Look who's with me.  Carson Daly.  Unbelievable.  He's the biggest playboy here.  He's stooped more bitches than anyone in this room. 
[02:18:30]  Carson Daly.  So studly.  So handsome.  So frigging dull.  How do you score, man?  You must be hung like a great babe.  What am I doing talking to you?  J-Lo.  J-Lo.  Please.  J-Lo, please.  Let me sniff your butt. 
[02:19:00]  Come on.  J-Lo.  Yeah, that's my highlight from last night.  J-Lo.  That was my favorite part of the whole show, right there.  I saw that.  J-Lo and pushed him away.  She was like, not having that.  She was pissed, not having that.  She has quite a sense of humor about herself, doesn't she, Lo-J?  You know, that dog's a puppet, by the way.  I saw the guy carrying it around.  Yeah, it's just a puppet.  Robert Schmeigel. 
[02:19:30]  Right, Robert.  Yeah, yeah.  I saw it.  It was dead without his hand in it.  Doesn't even move.  Doesn't move, huh?  Is that who's doing the voice?  He's brilliant.  That's a great bit.  I love that.  Really?  The Comedy Central Show.  Oh, God.  What is it called?  TV Fun House.  TV Fun House.  God, it's so funny.  It's great.  Yeah.  It's sick.  I should tell people we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Hello, everybody.  Mike from the Real World New York is in the house.  Is he?  Hi, yeah.  Hey, yo, yo.  Hello, Mike.  How's that? 
[02:20:00]  All right, we've got to get to the Dale Earnhardt Jr. thing.  All right.  Everyone's clapping.  Stinky, you like this one?  Marion, Lady Di on the red carpet yesterday at the VMAs, doing all the interviews in their  babbling style.  This was Cringe Radio at its best.  We didn't know where we could hide, Anthony.  We all, you know, when Dale Earnhardt died a few months back, you saw Dale Earnhardt Jr.  everywhere.  You know, everyone knows who Dale Earnhardt Jr. is for the most part.  And he walks up to where we're hanging, and I'm thinking to myself, holy ass, it's Dale 
[02:20:30]  Earnhardt Jr.  Yeah.  And, well, retarded Laverne Shirley, here we go.  Hey, who are you?  We'd like to do an interview with you.  I'm going to do an interview with you.  Hi.  I'm going to do an interview with you.  Who are you?  Dale Earnhardt Jr.  Who's that?  Dale Earnhardt Jr.  Dale Earnhardt.  Oh, I'm sorry.  You don't look like him.  I'm talking about your dad and everything.  I'm talking about your dad.  Yeah.  You know, so how are you doing since, are you winning any races?  Okay, all right.  I don't watch, um.  You got it.  I don't watch car racing. 
[02:21:00]  I enjoy some.  Yeah.  Oh, there we are.  Good.  Nice.  Nice jacket.  Nice pantsuit.  Pantsuit.  Pantsuit.  I heard that.  My mother is 64.  We've got to get you a new pantsuit.  A pantsuit.  Nice pantsuit.  You don't look like him.  And she didn't know what to say.  She's like, oh, so how have you been since?  Oh, I can't go there.  Um, how are you doing, uh, that whole thing with your, uh, did you win any races? 
[02:21:30]  Did you win any races?  Did you win any races since you're, ooh, forgets.  I was just awful.  Well, at least you have a mother.  You don't look like him.  Hey, Uncle John.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, after hearing that clip, I will gladly donate the silver to Meltdown to make bullets  to have those two killed.  No.  Yeah, I think that's all it takes.  They are comedy gold, my friend.  Oh, man.  That is awesome.  Radio gold, I should say.  Later, guys.  All right.  Dale Earnhardt Jr. wished he had his, uh, car to drive away from them or over them.  And lightning-fast speed or into a wall. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, God.  Uh, Janet Jackson walking by, Anthony.  Hey, Janet.  Hey, Janet Jackson.  Hi.  Hey, Janet.  Hi, Janet.  All right.  Janet.  Janet.  Will.  Hey, Will.  Will Farrell.  Yay.  How are you?  Hey.  Guy with the checkered shirt.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, checkers.  Checkers.  Hey, boy.  Hey, checkers.  These are some of the most riveting interviews I've heard.

Wait.  Are you all going in?  No. 
[02:25:30]  We always can work.  Wait, can you get a semi?  Yeah, can you get a semi?  No, I can't get y'all in.  Why not?  Get us a ticket?  Because I don't know y'all.  Where are the parties?  Where are the parties?  I'm Lady Dine.  That's married.  Where are the parties?  Where are the parties?  Where are the parties?  You have to get in there and you have to get hit on the two-way.  You got a two-way?  You got a two-way?  No.  We have cell phones.  No, no, no.  Cell phones are obsolete nowadays.  No, no, no.  That's old school.  You got to get it two-way.  See, what's going to happen is, once everybody decides where the party is, they're going  two-way each other and then you get the two-way and then you know.  Hey, two-way, I only go one way.  What I'm going to do is, y'all wait right here until the show is over, right? 
[02:26:00]  Okay.  And then after that, I'm going to come back and let y'all know where the party is, all right?  All right.  Gabby, Gabby, Gabby, Gabby, Gabby, Gabby, Gabby, Gabby, Gabby, Gabby, Gabby, Gabby, Gabby.  What's your name?  Mariette.  My name is Diana.  All right, y'all take it.  Tech was loving, loving them.  Yo, yo, yo, that's fly.  I'm going to be, she calls him bro.  I was waiting for the yin-yang parties.  Yeah, I know.  What was that song I was waiting for?  Yin-yang party, bro.  Yo, yo, that's fly, bro.  Fly, bro. 
[02:26:30]  The whitest woman on the face of the earth.  Going yo, yo, yo.  Yo, yo, yo.  Wow.  Oh, I just popped the picture up again so I could take a look with her paisley pants suit.  Yo, yo, yo.  Is that a yo, yo?  What about at the end?  She's going yabba-dabba-doo, yo.  All right.  The next, the next interaction, there's not much to it, but the funny part about it is  Mark Wahlberg was right near our section, and Carrot Top was right near our section. 
[02:27:00]  They wanted to talk to Carrot.  They started yelling for Carrot Top.  Yeah, you know what happened, Mark Wahlberg.  I love the Marky.  He just reached the end of the media pit that was to our right, and he's just ready to cross  in front of our area.  Right.  So we're waiting and going, okay, this will be great.  He's going to walk right in front, Lady Diane Marion, boom, get him.  The second he starts moving, they see Carrot Top.  Oh, God.  And they start yelling, Carrot Top, Carrot Top.  It's like, Mark Wahlberg, there he goes.  Bye-bye.  It's got a movie that comes out today. 
[02:27:30]  But I saw Mark Wahlberg's face.  It looked exactly like when he first saw the gorilla walking around and riding horseback  in Planet of the Apes.  I love Mark Wahlberg.  He's incredibly talented.  And how could they go for Carrot Top?  Carrot Top.  Over Marky Marky.  Well, let's check it out.  Where?  Up in Anthony Radio Show.  Up in Anthony Radio Show.  Have you been on a show?  No, I've not been on your show.  Yes, I have been on.  I'm with Jim Norton.  Hey, man.  How are you guys doing?  Right on.  Have you known Jim Norton?  Yeah.  Hurry up, because NSYNC's coming. 
[02:28:00]  I only have a minute.  NSYNC's on their way.  Hurry.  Ask him something.  Who do you want to win?  How would I want to win?  I'm Destiny's stepchild, so.  Destiny's stepchild?  Destiny's stepchild.  Yeah, how much money are you going for AT&T?  What would you like to win?  Not enough, because I'm here.  I'm not enough.  Yeah, but you're still here, though.  I'm here, yeah.  You're here.  We're out here.  We want to be here.  Yeah, right, right.  Any way you can get happy?  The only thing's separating us is a piece of cloth, so really, we've gone.  Any way you can get us in?  You still do stand-up comedy?  Oh, absolutely.  Everywhere.  Everywhere they're painting.  I'm a whore.  I didn't tell you that.  Caroline, that box that you have. 
[02:28:30]  No, I haven't done Caroline's in the office.  I don't play anywhere.  I don't play there much.  I'm on the road.  Like where?  Like anywhere you name a city, I'm going to go.  What about New Jersey?  New Jersey, yeah.  Have you known everybody Jim Norton?  No.  Oh, Jim Norton.  Yeah, right on.  Jim Norton.  Do you like Andrew Dice Clay?  Do you like Andrew Dice Clay?  I love Dice Clay.  Good, good.  Go away.  What about Jay Moore?  What about Jay Moore?  Jay Moore?  Yeah.  Love Jay Moore.  Enough of that.  All right.  Obviously, not much there, but the whole time, Ant and I are freaking because Mark Wahlberg's 
[02:29:00]  right there.  Yeah, and they're talking to the likes of Carrot Top.  Stop talking to Carrot Top.  Try to get something going with Mark Wahlberg.  I like that Marion asked him about the AT&T commercial or the 1-800-collector, whatever  the hell commercial he's doing.  I was funny to make for that.  Which just spells a hoo-ah.  He said it.  If I were Carrot Top, I would not leave the house.  I know.  I wouldn't leave the house.  I couldn't leave the house.  Just the worst hack, prop, comic.  But he's got an AT&T account. 
[02:29:30]  That's good.  They like them.  America loves him.  All right.  We got two more to get to before break-in, before we have to say goodbye, Marion.  I have to go.  I've got things to do.  I guess.  What is this, Rick?  When a whole bunch of people start walking by really fast?  People are going by pretty quick.  Nobody's stopping to talk to them, obviously.  No one's stopping at anyone, though, at this point, because now it's getting close.  And they're just...  I think NSYNC is in here, right?  They walked right by us?  They could have been around that section.  It could have been at...  Well, this clip is labeled Various Yelling.  Hey, it's Gwen.  Hi, Gwen. 
[02:30:00]  Hi, Gwen.  Hey, Gwen Stefani.  Hey, Gwen Stefani.  Hey, Gwen Stefani.  How are you?  Hey, Gwen.  Look at how she looked at them.  Where's Chris?  Hey, Chris.  Chris Walken.  Christopher Walken, what are you doing?  Hey, J-Boy loves you.  Hey, J-Boy really loves you.  Are you?  Yes.  I love Christopher.  Every nice play loves him, too.  What?  Oh, my God.  All right, I'm drained. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  The idiot time.  This is so funny.  All right, Chris, we'll walk and take my lap, Phil.  Well, I've had a time today, boys.  Gwen did look hot, man.  Yeah.  Oh, you did.  I saw her last night at a party.  She looked great.  She looked beautiful, yeah.  Gorgeous.  And I saw Gina Gashon last night, who I went to college with.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, wow.  I went to college with her.  I did shows with her in college.  Oh, really?  And she's like, oh, we were in Boston together.  I said, we went to college together.  Gina.  Yeah.  We were teasing each other.  I said, what are you doing? 
[02:31:00]  I said, it's Sex in the City.  I'm doing Caroline's.  Oh, I said, you should come.  You're in New York.  You didn't come see me at Cabaret.  I'm like, I saw it once, and I don't want to see it with you.  Oh.  After seeing Natasha Richardson.  Little catty.  I'm not going to come see you sing Kander and Ebb.  My good is sitting alone in your room.  All right.  I got to go.  You guys, thank you.  I love you guys, and I have the best time with you.  I really do.  And Mike, it was a pleasure meeting you.  Good luck with your career.  You're a good-looking young man.  You should go far, but where's the talent? 
[02:31:30]  Goodbye.  There he goes.  Mario K.  All these shows.  There you go.  Goodbye, everybody.  All right.  Take it easy, Mario.  Welcome to you in the theater.  Hey, before we take a break, another clip of the Retard Laverne Shirley as they interviewed  the big names at the VMAs last night.  Who is this that we have now?  The Bon Jovi.  Oh, you know what?  It would be great to tease this and make people wait, but it's good.  Yeah, we just have Bon Jovi and Richie Sambara walking by. 
[02:32:00]  Right.  Lady Di and Marion now.  This is their music.  Huge Bon Jovi.  They're the hugest Bon Jovi fans.  So they really, like, had a hemorrhage.  They freaked out.  Right.  When they walked by.  And you could tell.  They were very excited.  All right.  Richie Sambara.  Oh, my God.  We love you, Richie Sambara.  Richie Sambara.  We love you.  Richie.  We love you, Jerry Sambara.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  There's all living on a prayer. 
[02:32:30]  It's my life.  It's my life.  It's my life.  It's now or never.  Oh, they need a record deal really bad.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Wow.  Play it again.  Play it again.  That was so good.  You could tell they were genuinely excited.  Play it again?  Yeah, just listen to the way they scream.  Oh, my God.  We love you. 
[02:33:00]  Richie Sambora.  We love you.  Richie.  Oh, my God.  Hey, Joby.  We love you guys.  Hey, halfway there.  Oh, living on a prayer.  Oh, my God. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, my God.  You suffer in shock attack.  It's John Bon Jovi.  I'll talk to John Bon Jovi and make it look like an accident.  Shop the rabbit.  He brought us here.  I was hoping those guys would call the show tonight.  Classic.  They lost their mind.  You heard Mary. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, my God.  All right.  That's a great one.  Quick break.  We're going to finish up the clips right after commercials.  On the way, a little bit with Mick Jagger.  Not much, but it's still pretty interesting.  We've got a good story to tell with that.  Tommy Hilfiger.  Yeah.  When you hear what they said to him, you're going to fall out of your chair.  Destiny's Child.  Carson Daly.  Kelly Ripa.  Sway.  Yes.  From MTV News, yo.  Mm-hmm, yo.  And Andrew Cuomo.  Yeah. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, and Andrew!  Conquer Earth, you bastards!  1027 WNEW.  Right about now.  The Funk Soul Brother.  Check it out now.  The Funk Soul Brother.  Right about now.  The Funk Soul Brother.  Check it out now.  Check the Funk Soul Brother.  Right about now.  The Funk Soul Brother.  Check it out now.  The Funk Soul Brother.  Right about now.  The Funk Soul Brother. 
[02:35:00]  Check it out now.  The Funk Soul Brother.  Right about now.  The Funk Soul Brother.  Check it out now.  The Funk Soul Brother.  And we're back with the O&A show.  Thanks for checking us out today.  One of the highlights for me last night was when Ben introduced Fatboy Slim to Buster.  Rhymes.  Yes.  What a moment.  That was really, really cool when we were hanging in the downstairs bar with all the 
[02:35:30]  homies.  And they were smoking their blunts.  And it was getting cloudy in that room.  It was getting cloudy.  It was getting cloudy.  Yeah.  Yin Yang party.  Yeah.  And, of course, the new style.  Oh, boy.  All the hip-hop guys wearing now.  For some reason, you wear your football jersey. 
[02:36:00]  That might sound like everyone does this.  No.  The hip-hop guys, you've got to wear it backwards so the name is on your chest now.  We saw it last night.  I don't know.  I thought the new style was making believe you can't dribble a basketball.  Yeah.  It just flies off the stage.  This style is a pantsuit.  All right.  Let's get to the rest of the clips from The Retard of the Vernon Shirley.  All right.  What are we up to now?  Well, we're up to Mick Jagger, Anthony.  Mick Jagger, of course. 
[02:36:30]  Legendary singer of the Rolling Stones.  Yeah.  Needless to say.  And, well, there's a little, there's not much here, unfortunately.  But Mick Jagger made his way, you know, through the red carpet.  He wasn't talking to anyone.  And then something caught his attention.  Ben actually was yelling out that he wanted Mick to come over and talk about his new album.  Now, somebody talking about their new album, sure.  They want to do that.  They want to push it.  So he starts making his way over to the microphones. 
[02:37:00]  And then he sees the retarded Laverne and Shirley and a look of horror in his face.  And then he runs off.  He's gone.  If he was coming over.  I mean, he got close enough because Norton and I both shook his hand.  And I finally got the microphone right.  And then he goes, net.  And he's on the table.  Was that before or after you told him he dropped something?  That was after.  But the running gag that was going on the whole night.  Yeah.  Norton is standing right by the carpet.  And everyone that passed by, he would go, you dropped something. 
[02:37:30]  And then turn his head real quick.  So they wouldn't know where it came from.  But they would all stop.  They're looking around behind him.  And then they look at the crowd, you know, a few people that were in our compound.  And they're like, yeah, smart answers.  They got all pissed.  But every one of them fell for it.  Drop something.  And you turn your head.  Try it out on the streets.  It works great.  It's a great gag.  There was some rapper, some whole posse.  They got the whole crew.  There was like six of them.  Yeah, yeah, looking.  They're all looking around.  You dropped something.  Norton was pulling that gag on everybody.  It worked like a charm.  Once again, all the publicists having no sense of humor. 
[02:38:00]  Don't know how to have fun whatsoever.  I'm surprised Jim Norton hasn't called the show to give his observations from yesterday.  But that's okay.  All right.  I think if you listen closely, you might get to hear Mick Jagger say, no way or something.  Hey, Mick.  Mick Jagger.  Mick Jagger came over and took one look at them and then bolted. 
[02:38:30]  I just shook one of my favorites.  Oh, it's so close.  So cool.  That would have been the coolest thing ever.  Yeah, you heard them like, oh, no.  Mick Jagger, how are ya?  How are ya?  How are ya?  How are ya?  Shut up.  The other thing about Mick was no publicist was telling Mick what to do.  I mean, he wouldn't, you know, he was doing whatever he wanted to do and he almost came over. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah.  That was so close.  And we're like, come on, come on, come on, come on.  Oh.  Yeah, because a retarded Laverne and Shirley meeting Mick Jagger moment would have just been killer.  Anthony, this is one of my faves.  There's the designer, Tommy Hilfiger.  He's not one of my faves.  This interview is, though.  Check it out.  Tommy Hilfiger.  Hey, how are you?  I want to ask you a question.  Who do you think is going to win?  Who do you want to win tonight?  I'm not sure.  Well, I'll decide after Watson performs. 
[02:39:30]  I know you're a designer.  Do you think a lot of people are wearing your clothes?  All right.  We wear your clothes.  We wear your clothes.  No, you don't.  Get a nice suit on, Tommy.  Of course he does.  He's one of the top designers ever.  I got to hear this again, because there's three things.  You think people are wearing your clothes?  Wearing your clothes?  It's Tommy Hilfiger.  Tom designer.  We wear your clothes.  No, they don't.  And you have a nice suit on.  Of course he's Tommy Hilfiger.  This is worth hearing again. 
[02:40:00]  Jackass.  And they called him Tommy Hilfiger.  Tommy Hilfiger. 
[02:40:30]  How are you?  How are you?  That's a nice suit.  How are you?  Tommy, how are you?  Shut the F up.  If I hear that, how are you?  One more frigging time out of her.  How are you?  Awful.  All right.  The next one is Jason Sehorne.  This is some good stuff.  Jason Sehorne.  Hey, Jason.  How are you?  How are you?  Very good.  How's your wife?  She's beautiful.  Good, good.  Hey, how's the team doing this year? 
[02:41:00]  What do you think you're going to do?  What's the season so far?  Monday is the first game.  We're going to find out today.  All right.  What's that?  You made a kick-ass on Denver or why?  You hope so.  All right.  I wish you luck this year.  Thank you.  I'm a Giants fan.  Tell Jim Foss what we said to know.  I can pass it along for you.  We're Giants and Jet fans.  All right.  Oh, there it is.  We're from Jersey.  That's why.  We're from Jersey.  Hey, come back.  We were all just having fun.  Yeah, he just ran off at that point.  It was over. 
[02:41:30]  We're Giants and Jet fans.  Oh, you idiots.  It's like that clip of that moment in Spinal Tap when they're playing the Air Force Base  and the guy goes, I'm a real big fan of your music.  Well, not yours per se.  The whole genre.  Right.  All right.  This is a little quick interaction with Destiny's Child.  Hey, I don't think you're ready for Destiny's Child.  Destiny, I don't think you're ready. 
[02:42:00]  Hi.  Yeah, hi.  She's on some kind of drugs.  I don't think you're ready.  I don't think you're ready for Destiny's Child.  I don't think you're ready.  Oh, my God.  I'm exhausted from laughing too much.  It's awful.  This next clip of Montel Williams is funny.  This is when I ran to the bathroom and missed you, too.  I'm so freaking pissed at that. 
[02:42:30]  But it's just really funny because then she gets all belligerent after he blows her off.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, because he doesn't stop.  You know, Montel is just walking.  He's not talking to anybody.  He should stop.  There's not much going on there.  Yeah, I know.  With his little career.  Hey, Montel, come here.  I'm going to have a couple questions.  Come here.  Come here.  Come on, Montel.  I like your...  Hey, I watch your talk show.  Thanks a lot for dissing me.  I'm not watching it ever again.  You're a retard. 
[02:43:00]  See?  Thank you.  I'm over here now.  That's right.  Yeah.  Boogaloo.  I'm not watching this show ever again.  He's got millions.  Again, if I...  I hope you have died of cancer.  Yeah.  Let me go to another movie.  That famous line.  The King of Comedy.  King of Comedy.  When Jerry Lewis is walking down the street and the woman asks if he could talk on the payphone  with her sick son or brother or something.  She's a big fan.  I'm a huge fan, Jerry.  Could you just say hi on the phone? 
[02:43:30]  Could you just say hi?  My brother's sick in the hospital.  Jerry, I love you.  Could you say hi?  And he walks away and goes, no, I don't have time.  You should die of cancer.  I hope you get cancer.  She yells at him.  Yeah, let's hear that again.  The first part.  Hey, Montel, come here.  I'm going to have a couple questions.  Come here.  Come here.  Come on, Montel.  I like your...  Hey, I watch your talk show.  Thanks a lot for dissing me.  I'm not watching it ever again.  You're a retard.  For dissing me.  Thank you.  I'm over here now. 
[02:44:00]  That's right.  Yeah.  Boogaloo.  I'm not watching it ever again.  I'm not watching it, son.  Just a spit factory.  I miss when Carson Daly walked by.  This was all, I guess, when I was taking the leak, huh?  That was a watchy blue early.  Not much?  Hey, Carson.  Carson.  How are you, buddy?  Hey.  You dropped something.  There's Norton.  Hey, Carson.  You're shooting.  Yeah, yeah.  I didn't think we had audio of Norton playing the game.  He got him.  That would do not.  And he got Carson.  He got him good. 
[02:44:30]  Carson stopped, turned around.  He's looking around.  And he made that you dick face.  And walked, and kept walking.  Hey, Carson.  Carson.  How are you, buddy?  Hey.  You dropped something.  Hey, Carson.  His shoes aren't tied.  His sneakers aren't tied.  Tie them.  It's like a stripping fall.  Nice shirt.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  His shoes aren't tied.  We're almost at the end here. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, our old friend Jimmy Kimmel.  Jimmy Kimmel.  From the Man Show, Anthony.  He was walking by with Carson, and Carson kept walking, and Jimmy Kimmel stopped for a  little while.  When he realized.  Hey, we're from the O.P. Anthony Show.  Hey, how's everything?  How's it going?  Hey, Jimmy.  We're from the O.P. Anthony Show.  How you doing?  Oh, hi.  You're from the O.P. Anthony Show.  Hi.  How are you doing?  Oh, yes.  How are you?  Good.  I'm good.  I'm not good.  Hey, how are you doing?  Who are you?  I'm just a fan of the retarded.  Just wanted to stop.  Yeah, we've heard of you.  I want to jump on a trampoline, buddy. 
[02:45:30]  Oh, yeah.  See, she knows.  Sure, absolutely.  Yeah.  Yeah, sure.  It's a good exercise.  Okay, I got to go.  I know.  Nice to meet you, retarded folks.  You too.  Bye.  All right.  Bye.  Hey, who's that?  Jimmy Kimmel.  Jimmy Kimmel.  Yeah, right after you left.  You too.  What are you doing?  Jesus, man.  I want to jump on the trampoline.  I can jump on the trampoline.  Oh, man, please.  First time a woman put a hole in a trampoline.  Eesh. 
[02:46:00]  All right.  And now retards on trampolines.  Hey, I'd watch that.  Yeah.  All right.  Here's when Kelly Ripper will walk by.  Kelly Ripper.  We only have a couple more.  Ripper.  Hey.  How are you?  Kelly Ripper.  Hey, Kelly.  Hi.  How's the baby?  Hey, Kelly.  How's the baby?  What are you doing?  Hey.  We're Leverna Shirley.  Come here.  We're in.  We're in for you.  We're Leverna Shirley.  Remember Opie and Anthony?  Yeah.  She does.  Yeah.  She does.  Hey, remember Jay Moore?  The opening. 
[02:46:30]  Opening at Anthony's show.  Hey, Kelly.  I like all my children.  All right.  All right.  Ben Stiller.  Ben Stiller.  No.  Hey, Kelly.  Stiller.  Hey, Kelly.  His shoes aren't tied.  Okay.  She doesn't have shoes.  What?  I knew that.  They started seeing that Norton was getting a response with the drop something, so that  was their whole gag.  Your shoes aren't tied.  Your shoes aren't tied.  They said that to one of the hip-hop guys, and the guy's like, yo, that's the style now. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, that was the funny part was they kept trying to pull that gag, and then one of  the hip-hop guys walked past, and he did have his shoes aren't tied.  And they go, your shoes aren't tied.  You know, that's the style.  You're going to call on Trip.  Yeah.  Jim Norton.  What's up, guys?  How are you?  That was hysterical.  You dropped something gag.  Yeah, I heard.  I didn't hear on the air.  I was just on the computer, and somebody said that they were talking about it.  I got that from Florentine originally, and it's always funny.  Always funny.  It's never not funny.  My only regret was that we didn't do it to Mick Jagger, because what would have been 
[02:47:30]  better than to just make a relic, turn around, and look for something?  Are you recuperating, or what?  Yeah, I didn't do much, man.  I just did a couple of spots last night, afterwards, and that was it.  I didn't go in, obviously, because I had shows to do.  Well, great job.  You kept us very entertained with your gags.  Yeah, somebody told me that they were playing on Ron and Fez or something, and that I was  filthy.  I kept cursing, and I forgot we were being taped.  Yeah, well, the thing was, we were being taped to edit it down today, but Ron and Fez, 
[02:48:00]  like, popped us up a couple of times during the night, and at one point, I think you had  no clue.  You were on the air.  You said, I just hope there's a shooting tonight.  I hope someone gets shot tonight.  Yeah, I remember saying that.  I think I said it to Ben.  You did.  Yeah, I was very pleased thinking about that.  Yeah, I bet.  But as they told me that, I'm running through my head.  I'm like, did I say anything really awful about somebody, you know, or whatever?  Yeah, I know.  You start thinking, what the hell did I say?  Yeah, we all checked ourselves when we found out they were popping us up. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, no.  I almost called you at the 3.30 in the morning last night.  Oh.  Just to panic.  Like, you know, I hope I didn't trash somebody, like, that I shouldn't have, or, you know.  Yeah, no, it's all good.  All right.  You know how you panic, because I have a big mouth, and I'm a little person.  Those things never go together.  It's all good.  All right, man.  All right, man.  Have a great weekend.  We'll talk to you next week.  Okay, guys.  All right.  Thanks for everything yesterday.  No, please.  Thanks for getting me in there.  I never would have got in there on my own.  Yeah.  Cool.  Later, bud.  All right, man.  Take it easy.  Nothing.  Who else is left now? 
[02:49:00]  Just three.  We got Sway from MTV.  Oh, two.  Two.  Two.  Two.  Sway from MTV News.  Yeah.  This is pretty good.  Hey, who are you?  Sway?  I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Sway.  Sway.  Sway.  We're following the O.B. Anthony show.  Just don't call me right.  Okay.  O.B. Anthony show.  Oh, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, hey, hey.  We're going to show him.  Oh, no.  Yeah, yeah.  We're in that case for the show.  Okay.  Hey, nice hat.  Nice hat.  Beautiful.  It's bandana.  Original, something I created back at home.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you like the colors?  Yeah, I like it.  Do you know the clothing line?  Hey, that's Fabi.  I like that.  Temple.  Yeah, I like your outfit. 
[02:49:30]  Would you get it?  Yeah, I like your outfit.  I got this on the wardrobe of MTV, you know.  But, you know, your shoes aren't tight.  You got to check your shoes.  No, that's the style.  All right.  Yeah, but you got to watch your own trip and fall.  Yeah, I kind of want to do that.  That way, you know, you'll make it on trailer if you trip and fall, all right?  Yeah.  Bye.  Thank you for talking.  Good luck.  All right.  Thank you for talking.  Thank you for talking.  It's like, I can care less.  There's more celebrities than a view.  Thank you for talking.  All right.  And finally, Andrew Cuomo.  Hold on.  How's that?  Hold on. 
[02:50:00]  We got to explain who Andrew Cuomo is.  And who was he bringing in?  He was with Russell Simmons.  Okay.  He was with Russell Simmons.  Right.  Andrew Cuomo, son of Mario Cuomo.  Used to be the governor of New York.  In the state of New York, liberal ass sea sucker.  Almost ruined the whole state.  Mr. Welfare.  Oh, sorry.  I was editorializing.  And this is his son.  Yeah, that was his son.  I'm exhausted.  Just play this. 
[02:50:30]  How are you doing?  How's everything?  Are you Mario Cuomo, son?  Yes, sir.  That's where they come.  Who are you?  Nice to see you.  You're Andrew Cuomo?  You're running for something besides the door.  I know that.  And he then ran for the door.  Run for something besides the door.  You know, I love those two.  That's it.  Yeah.  That's about 50 clips we just played from last night after we went off the air. 
[02:51:00]  Can we hear 17 one more time?  Which one's 17?  It's all right.  It's Brian McFadden, who's now on MTV.  And he used to be Alter Boy on the station here in New York on K-Rock.  He was a sidekick and really didn't add much to the show.  And they didn't even put his mic up that much.  Yeah.  And then he changed his name back to whatever.  To Brian McFadden.  And now everybody that watches MTV around the country knows him as Brian McFadden. 
[02:51:30]  But if you're from New York, you know him as Little Alter Boy.  Right.  And we decided to just have the retarded Laverne and Shirley just refer to him as Alter Boy.  Hey, Alter Boy.  Hey, you're a tool.  How you doing?  How are you?  Good.  How you been?  Who are you?  Hey, you're a tool.  My radio days.  That's awesome.  Hey, you're a tool.  Who do you want to win?  Who do I want to win?  Yeah.  Michael Jackson.  How's Kane doing?  I'm Jackson.  How's Kane doing?  You guys.  When are you going to have some talent?  We're going to be in the Anthony show. 
[02:52:00]  We're going to be in the Anthony show.  Hey, what happened to your hair?  What happened to her?  Hey, what happened to yours?  Something happened to yours.  You know what she was doing there, which is really funny?  She does this every time.  If someone insults her, she can do nothing but say the exact same thing back to the person.  So she goes, what happened to your hair?  And he looks and he goes, what happened to your hair?  Because she's got that wacky perm.  So then she has to go again and go, well, what happened to your hair?  Like, she doesn't know what to do. 
[02:52:30]  You know, there's something in there that we haven't even talked about.  Ben asked Alter Boy if he remembers getting in a fight with us.  Oh, right.  And he may believe he didn't remember, but at the Hard Rock.  He goes, oh, I love you guys.  I'm like, that's funny.  We almost got in a fight three years ago.  And he's like, oh, I don't remember that.  We all had a huge fight with him.  Because he mouthed off.  Alter Boy and Kane.  He was walking out.  I said something to him.  I don't even remember what it is now.  Something I think is questioning his masculinity.  You called him a faggot. 
[02:53:00]  I called him a faggot as he's walking out of the Hard Rock.  And he stops and turns around.  And we all started laughing.  I go, what are you going to do?  Where are you even keep walking out that door?  And he did.  But I guess he didn't remember that now that he's Brian McFadden.  Blocked it out.  All right.  Hey, Toll.  Hey, Toll.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Stay there. </pre>
