<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with Opie detailing his severe diarrhea (blamed on excessive ice cream cake consumption) and Anthony revealing he had pertussis.  They mercilessly mocked Jim Norton's sleep apnea mask, likening it to a noose. Norton defended his equipment, explaining its complexities and his ongoing struggles with it. Opie also complained about the burden of carrying luggage. The hosts announced the upcoming appearances of Penthouse Pet models and Donald Trump Jr., the latter accompanied by a film crew.

A significant portion of the early show focused on their scathing critique of a rapping grandmother ("Granny G") on "America's Got Talent,"  followed by a discussion of Howard Stern's new role as a judge on the same show, expressing a mixture of amusement and envy at his success and perceived persona shift.  They did, however, compliment a contortionist dancer featured on the show.

The show then transitioned to a graphic recounting of a “snowballing” incident (involving oral sex and the exchange of bodily fluids) shared by Troy Kwan from the after-show.  The hosts, along with guest Danny, engaged in a highly explicit discussion of the event, their own experiences with similar acts, and their opinions on the matter. This segment also included a detailed, vulgar conversation about fleshlights, focusing on their use and cleaning (or lack thereof). The woman involved in the snowballing incident was alluded to but not named.

A later segment revolved around another of Troy's sexual encounters, this time with a porn star.  The details of this encounter, including specific sexual acts and graphic descriptions, were shared explicitly.  The porn star's identity remained obscured, though clues were dropped, suggesting listeners could likely guess.  This section also included further explicit sexual stories, including one about underage girls at a party, and a discussion of Troy's younger sexual experiences.  The conversation also included speculation about celebrity encounters (mentioning Veruca Salt and Rachel Maddow), comparisons between the show's audience and that of television morning shows, a revisit of their "Most Offensive Song Contest,"  and playing clips from *All in the Family* featuring Sammy Davis Jr. (on the anniversary of his death), along with a discussion of the anniversaries of *Pet Sounds* and *Blonde on Blonde*.  The segment further included discussions of food preferences (pizza, Long Island deli sandwiches, Philly cheesesteaks, Chicago deep dish, New York pizza), reminiscing about past radio stunts (including the "blue tarp cabaret"), and a story about a strip club visit causing issues with Troy's then-girlfriend.  It concluded with a comedic audio montage of the hosts' pre-show morning noises and plans for obtaining Philly cheesesteaks.

The show then discussed the movie *God Bless America*, praising its satire of shock jocks, reality TV, and pop culture, while noting its later unrealistic elements. Clips from *Unmatchables* featuring Jim Jefferies and Justine Jolie, showcasing vulgar and sexually explicit humor (including a spanking scene), were played and discussed.

Donald Trump Jr. joined the show, initially discussing an upcoming fly fishing trip, the announcement of his fourth child, his experiences on *Celebrity Apprentice* (commenting on Arsenio Hall and Clay Aiken), a hunting trip controversy involving TMZ and PETA, his views on hunting, the 2024 Presidential Election, and anecdotes from his childhood and boarding school.

In a later segment with Trump Jr., the conversation shifted to his high tax burden, contrasting it with those paying no federal income tax; he criticized a perceived lack of work ethic in some welfare recipients.  This led to a broader critique of the political climate, emphasizing personal responsibility and criticizing reliance on "hope" over hard work. He recounted his grandparents' struggles in communist Czechoslovakia to highlight the importance of hard work, criticized the slow rebuilding of the World Trade Center and political polarization, suggesting the need for a strong third party.  He also discussed his busy travel schedule, comparing commercial and private flights, and detailed his charitable activities.  The hosts and Trump Jr. also discussed the absurdity of the current political climate, knee-jerk apologies, and the influence of money in politics, proposing campaign finance reform.

Penthouse Pets Justine Jolie, Nikki Benz, and Heather Vandevin joined the show to promote *Saints Row The Third*.  A humorous anecdote involved a cowbell, Sal (from Howard Stern's show), and a sit-up competition resulting in Jolie's injury.  The conversation continued with sexually suggestive humor, discussions of sexual preferences, body image, and personal experiences, using vulgar language throughout.  The segment concluded with further discussion of the game and additional off-color jokes.

A final segment heavily featured a large purple dildo-shaped bat from *Saints Row: The Third*. The hosts and the Penthouse Pets (Jolie, Benz, and later Vandevin), along with Troy Kwan, spent considerable time playfully interacting with the prop, leading to sexually explicit discussions of threesomes, experiences in the adult film industry, and detailed descriptions of various sexual acts.  The conversations also touched on personal lives, relationships, infidelity, and unconventional sexual practices.  Roland was also mentioned in several anecdotes.  The segment ended with the guests sharing their Twitter handles.  The entire segment maintained a highly vulgar, humorous, and sexually charged tone.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  On the road.  Morning.  Morning, everybody.  We're all hurting.  This just doesn't fucking end.  We're all hurting across the board today.  Of course, you got Anthony Comeo coughing up a storm with his pertussis.  Holy shit.  Fucking every morning, it's just a chore to sit there and try to fucking cough. 
[00:00:30]  This sucks.  My God.  What the fuck?  What do you do about this?  You got to just, you got to wait it out.  It's 2012.  You got to keep your chin up.  We're going to turn this thing around.  We're going to turn it around.  I'm just sucking snot.  It's terrible.  You got that going on.  I got a duty problem. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah, huh?  I've had at least, I lost track, but I've shit at least ten times since the last time you heard my voice.  Oh, my God.  I've already shit three times this morning.  It's just falling out of me.  Oh, geez.  To the point where the duties aren't completely cooked.  Oh, God.  So, it's like partial, I think it's partial food.  It's just sliding through my entire system.  Wow.  Salad shooter?  Pretty much.  It's not, no, it's kind of together. 
[00:01:30]  It's holding, it's holding on.  It's not, it's not breaking down to the good old diarrhea.  It's waking me up in the middle of the night.  It's way low, man.  I got some kind of way low fucking bowel virus or something the last 24 hours.  So, I feel like shit.  You feel like shit.  And then Jimmy looks ridiculous with his sleep apnea mask.  I don't know how anyone sleeps like that.  Well, someone doesn't.  Looks like.  That's a chin strap I had to get.  You got to go to Jim Norton's Twitter.  Jim Norton on the old Twitter. 
[00:02:00]  He looks like the guy that got the alien put on his face.  Yeah.  That looks extremely uncomfortable.  I don't know how you would sleep that way.  Well, that get up you're looking at is just the little nose plugs and the chin strap.  What happens is when you start to fall asleep and you need air, it's pushing air down.  Right.  And it forces air, but it comes out my mouth.  So, you need a seal.  It's not broken.  So, they say some people need a chin strap.  Of course, why wouldn't Jimmy Norton need a chin strap? 
[00:02:30]  Why would it work easily?  So, I get the chin strap.  Yeah, but I noticed the chin strap can't really find your chin.  Yeah.  I know it's an old joke, but it looks like it's kind of barely hanging on.  It's more of a noose.  It's more of a noose.  But why is it pushing your nose all the way back?  It's kind of giving you, dare I say, a blacker nose.  That's the nose thing in my, that's the strap around my head for that nose thing.  It holds the nose pillows in.  But it's pushing it all the way back. 
[00:03:00]  That's because you want to hold it.  Look how wide your nose is.  Yeah, that's not uncomfortable.  It looks like it is, but it's really not.  All right.  But I'm still having air forced out of my mouth.  I'm falling asleep.  So, I put the full mask on, which is worse than this.  And I fell asleep a couple of times.  And I keep waking up.  And it sounds like this.  Oh, my God.  Because air is being forced.  Your lips are pressed together by the chin strap and the mask.  Right.  You just did an impression of my asshole, by the way.  Because I'm waking up with the same noise. 
[00:03:30]  And air is being forced out of my mouth.  So, I don't know what to do.  I might need a full face mask.  Or I might just need to fucking hang myself.  What about like a big, like a space helmet?  See, that's what it feels like I need.  That's a space helmet.  That's not a bad idea.  Why don't you go space?  Well, the full mask covers your nose and mouth.  And it prevents that.  Or I need to have the setting lower.  So, maybe the air is blowing too hard.  But it's very frustrating.  Because I'm doing the right thing.  I'm trying.  And, of course, the chin strap is needed.  And, of course, that doesn't work. 
[00:04:00]  And, of course, neither.  That's your life, Jimmy.  I hate being Jim Norton.  I really do.  Oh, Jimmy.  We just saw the luggage demonstration.  I have the best example of what it's like to be Jim Norton.  I have a luggage.  And I fucking am tormented by bringing my smaller bag on top of my bigger bag.  Because a smaller bag, there's no good way to carry it.  It keeps flopping off to the side.  I put it on the fucking, what do you want to call them?  The handle?  Yeah, yeah, your little extended handle.  Extended handle.  And I pull it, but it flops off to the side and always drags. 
[00:04:30]  I hate that.  I hate it.  So, I have the thing that the airline pilots use, which hooks on the front and you hang  your bag off of.  But, God forbid, Jim Norton should work.  It's just too short.  It's just frumpy.  I'm just a twat.  And it flops over.  When you let go of it, it just flops over.  I gave you that.  In that motion is my entire life.  It just flops to the floor.  You look like Hannibal Lecter a little bit there, huh?  That too is.  Maybe go with a Hannibal Lecter type get up. 
[00:05:00]  How far are those things up your nose?  They're not that far at all.  That's why they have to be pushed against your nose.  Because they're blowing a very solid stream of air in your nose.  And you don't even realize how solid it is until you take it off and it's like, holy shit.  It's like a fucking jet exhaust.  Are you sure you need that?  Yeah.  How do you have the surgery and everything?  You've got your shit dug.  It's a throat issue, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's about the throat.  And it just, the chin strap is supposed to hold your mouth closed.  That looks a lot worse than it is, I'm telling you.  Because once your head is down, especially with the bigger mask, I fell asleep. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  And it just, instead of fucking keeping me in sleep, it's waking me up.  Oh, man.  And I'm trying.  Four hours I tried.  So you didn't sleep?  No, why would I?  Why would Jim Norton sleep?  Fucking fat-titted zilch.  You'll sleep on the plane in LA.  Oh, yeah.  That'd be a comfortable flight.  I'd have to leave early.  Because NBC Travel fucked up the travel today.  That sucks.  You're going to miss the gals.  We've got girls coming around today. 
[00:06:00]  So we could just stare at them and do nothing with them.  New rules.  But it'll be cool.  Penthouse girls today.  Oh, I hope I don't shit my pants in front of them.  That would be embarrassing.  They never do anything, though.  They don't get naked, right?  Nothing.  We did find the fart machine, though.  So we might try to...  I think the bit would be hilarious if one of these hot penthouse girls, you know, farts and we put on the fart mask.  What do you do for this shit? 
[00:06:30]  For what?  This.  Oh, you got to take something.  It's too low, right?  It could take something.  It's too low.  What do you mean?  My belly feels good.  It looks good.  I'll have a full breakfast, but within an hour, it'll be through me.  Oh, God.  What do you do?  Is this going around, too?  No.  I haven't heard anyone having this.  I think you're stressed out.  I told...  Well, Jimmy was asking me questions.  I go, it could have been the...  It could have been the ice cream cake.  You still have that.  That'll do it.  That huge sheet, huge sheet of ice cream cake that we got for the kids' party. 
[00:07:00]  Been just taking a little slice a couple times a day.  Yeah, that's probably not good.  And I think our family is kind of, you know, ice cream.  The lactose intolerant.  Yeah, a little bit.  I don't think ice cream is our best friend.  Oh, that's what it is, dude.  You think?  Yeah.  I didn't have any yesterday, so...  That fucking ice cream cake I looked at and I wanted it, but that's why I didn't.  That's the only reason I didn't is because I would have been fucking...  Ew.  You want ice? 
[00:07:30]  Hot.  You want me to ruin everybody's day?  Give me ice cream cake.  Well, let's do that.  Fuck, why aren't you here for that?  That'd be hilarious with the girls.  I'm back Friday morning.  Oh, yeah.  I'm back Friday morning.  That'd be great for the girls.  And we also got Donald Trump Jr. coming in today, so that'll be good.  He's got a film crew.  Oh, yeah?  Of course I'm going to miss that.  Why would I be here for the film crew?  We're going to look like idiots.  We just look sick in this room.  We look sick, right?  All of us.  Everyone's sickly.  Jimmy, lack of sleep, and coughing his ass off.  We're a sickly show. 
[00:08:00]  That's for Celebrity and Predator shooting, like, fucking insides out.  Nah, just for some...  Who knows?  Still, though, it's thought to do it.  Yeah, it's exciting, and then you realize they only use three seconds of their four-hour shoot.  I know.  No, they'll use them more.  He likes this show.  Every show people do, it takes forever.  Right.  They video or film so much shit, and they never use it.  All right.  This is great.  As I'm talking, I just feel like a ball in the back of my throat trying to fall out the 
[00:08:30]  front of my nose.  Really?  Yeah.  Why don't we just go home?  I should just go...  No one's paying attention around here.  This company is about to take it over by somebody.  So, they don't give a fuck about our sick days at this point.  Are they really?  Are they really?  Yeah, it's terrible.  Oh, boy.  There's...  There's...  There's something going on.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  All sorts of rumors and speculation.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Kenny?  Yes, sir?  I have tea.  No.  Sure. 
[00:09:00]  I just...  I just gotta try something.  Can you find something that'll make my duties more solid?  I just want everybody to know it's sad when I'm the best thing in the show today.  Yeah.  Well, slow down.  Slow down.  I feel terrific.  I look terrific.  I am terrific.  Kenny is the biggest asshole, by the way.  We didn't bring it up yesterday, Jimmy.  We were driving home.  Was that two days ago now?  And Kenny dropped me off, right? 
[00:09:30]  And he stops in the crosswalk as people are waiting to cross the street.  He could have pulled up literally 10 feet and it would have been cool.  He stops right in front of these people that are trying to cross the street.  Remember how annoyed they were?  Why should you be inconvenienced, GH?  Jesus.  These people looked at you.  They wanted to kill you.  Yeah, let them walk around the truck.  You walk directly to where you gotta go.  Look, I do dicky and ballsy things. 
[00:10:00]  I could never do that.  I was mortified.  I was like, oh my God, why did you do this?  And then I had to basically open my door and pretty much make them step back so I could  get out.  Get those insignificant people out of your way.  He's loyal.  Is it hot in here?  Yeah.  I'm gonna get you some throat coat with some honey.  Nice.  What's throat coat?  It's a new thing.  Oh, okay. 
[00:10:30]  It's throat coat tea.  All right.  I'll put some honey in it.  Thanks, honey.  What do you got for me?  I could plug your asshole with my finger.  He would almost do that, too, if you asked him.  Just because he wants to make sure you're feeling better.  That's all.  I have to cancel fucking my talk shows tonight.  They're not gonna be happy. 
[00:11:00]  Your audience, what their audience will be.  No, what the fuck?  You better cancel early so they don't get mad.  Yeah, I really.  Next first break we do all.  I can't cancel my TV.  I have to go to California.  I know, Jimmy.  Mr. Big Shot.  I want to thank Fishman5440 because it has started.  Oh, yeah, Fishman.  They're taking your sleep apnea picture there, Jimmy.  Look, and they put you underwater.  You're now underwater.  Look, no ridiculous photoshops of me.  Yeah, please. 
[00:11:30]  Let's not do that.  Do me a favor.  Don't make me look like an ass.  Yeah.  Jimmy wouldn't appreciate that.  And, E-Rock, do not put the best ones up on our Facebook page.  I think P-52 bomber pilot could be good.  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  Please don't do that.  How about you make him like a monster on the Empire State Building?  That doesn't fit at all, Chip.  Has Chip gone to L.A. too?  I'm sticking around.  Fuck.  I'm sticking like glue.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  How was everyone's nights?  Awful.  Why?  Because I'm not sleeping. 
[00:12:00]  No, before the sleep part.  Terrible because I know I'm not going to sleep.  I know I'm leading up to no sleep.  So it starts early?  Yeah.  Well, I watched the old America's Got Talent.  Yeah, people thought I watched.  I had a basketball game to watch.  I did watch a little.  But I call it jealousy.  Call it whatever the fuck you want.  But this me, me, me shit, I can't do it.  I was having a lovely conversation with some tweeters. 
[00:12:30]  Right.  Howard's a talented guy and all that.  Yes, we've admitted it.  But this me, me, me shit, I used to love America's Got Talent.  I can't watch the show now because they turned it into the Howard Stern show.  They should have gave him his own show.  I just find it weird to watch because it's not him.  I don't know who this is.  It's like weird to put him in the context of this nice guy that sits there and praises the dumb acts. 
[00:13:00]  Right.  Like there was some white woman rapping.  Yeah, there she is.  I saw maybe five minutes last night.  Bad.  It's like the old white woman rap thing.  So, Cher, I will.  Go ahead.  I will.  Yeah.  I mean, how many times?  She's got a walker?  Yeah, yeah.  It's like a little prop, I think.  Maybe.  Maybe she really does.  But let's listen to her.  This is Granny G, and I'm talking to all you horny boys out there. 
[00:13:30]  You better pay attention.  You're not taking names.  Hi, Granny G.  Listen to me, you piss-amp pants.  If you make a baby and then just split, you got no heart if you don't know.  The repercussions of a dad, you know, so that child is going to cry for you.  You better listen to me all too.  I fucking hate shit like this.  Are you embarrassed?  Yes.  Why do you hate shit like this?  Because it's just fucking...  She's grabbing her ass.  This is just the new gong show. 
[00:14:00]  It is.  It's probably not that old.  I kind of like that goofy shit when the gong show did it.  Like, it annoys you, though?  It annoys me.  Yeah.  I fucking get it.  Like, there's a physical feeling, I guess.  Yeah.  Damn, Jay-Z's got some competition.  No, he doesn't.  Westside, bitches!  Damn.  How great would it be if a gunshot rang out? 
[00:14:30]  Oh, yeah.  Eastside, motherfucker.  And I just blow her head off.  That bothered you?  It really bothered me.  Why didn't we hear the rest?  What happened there?  Where Howie comments.  Commercial started.  Commercial started right at that point.  In the middle of the...  That's what they do now.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  People are going to stick around and see what Cern says.  Oh, boy.  Well, I...  Now, that's my problem.  I pictured him just saying, like,  wow, that was terrible, dated... 
[00:15:00]  Stupid.  Fucking, yeah.  Like, what is this, fucking 1992 with the rapping grandmas?  Could I...  I'll be honest with you.  I didn't mind it, like you.  But you have to goof on it.  Right?  I hated it.  But you have to goof on it, no matter what.  Well, yeah.  I have no idea what was saying to this lady.  They're all cheering in the audience,  but I would absolutely have to goof on this.  Wow.  You know, Granite G,  do you write that yourself? 
[00:15:30]  Yes, I did.  And do you have a lot of other, uh...  I'm writing one for girls right now,  and it's going to be so hot.  Well, you're someone  who could be one of those people  that captures America's heart.  What?  So, um, I'm, I'm, I'm digging you.  No, you're not.  What?  That's just it, you're not.  He really, what?  Granite G, I think you are quite fabulous. 
[00:16:00]  However, I do think  that your walker should be, be dazzled.  You need some...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Be dazzled with her blood.  ...we need guys and thongs carrying you out,  then you get rid of the walker.  Well, let's, let's jazz it up.  All right, well, let's, folks.  Uh, I want to see more.  Okay.  So, I'm saying yes.  Thank you!  Yes.  She'd grab her chest  and fall over that walker.  Yeah.  Sure.  Yeah.  You're called my million-to-one shot. 
[00:16:30]  The chances of you winning  are a million-to-one,  but I'm going to say yes.  Yes!  Because what happens is  it becomes about ratings  and people want to see her next year.  That's fine.  It's a goof act.  I used to, I used to watch this show.  I, I, uh, I don't know.  I'm not going to, I'm not going to really be watching.  Um, but they, they have a bunch of goof acts.  Yeah.  Just to keep it a little interesting  for the first few weeks.  It's kind of like,  it's kind of like American Idol  where you have the goofy people.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:17:00]  Saying it's stupid shit.  Yeah, you got to have the goofy people.  But not one guy making fun of that.  I know, that should have just been.  That's just dumb.  You got to make fun of that.  Let, if you want to put her through,  that's fine, but, you know,  one out of the three  has got to say something stupid.  Because the rubes that watch this  would be offended.  Like, oh, you know,  just because she's old  doesn't mean you have to make fun of her.  No, actually it does.  She's out there rapping.  There's a rumor that Howard's  going to win the whole thing this year.  He's going to win America's Got Talent.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the twist,  that Howard wins the whole thing 
[00:17:30]  because no one in America  is as talented as him.  He gets the million dollar  Yeah, that's the twist this year.  I liked, uh...  I've heard, I've heard.  I liked the act where the woman  with the walker  got out of the elevator.  That, to me,  was a much better  and funnier segment.  I guess we're jealous, man.  I guess we're jealous.  I was fighting off  fucking Howard fans last night.  Pew, pew, pew, pew.  They were coming at me  from all directions.  They were saying,  I'm jealous.  Fuck out of here. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, they're like,  you're watching.  I'm like, no, I'm not.  I'm watching a great basketball game.  The Miami Heat  and the Indiana Pacers.  Yeah, but you're watching  I'm obsessed with the Heat  losing again.  Because you're jealous.  Yeah, I guess I am.  Yeah, I'm jealous of  how much money he makes, sure.  Right.  And he's certainly more popular  than us, of course.  But, I don't know.  This is great.  Could someone remind me  in two hours to drink this?  Is it fucking like lava?  It's fucking molten. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, they got really hot water  around here.  It's going through the cardboard.  You know the cardboard  they put around coffee cups for you?  But most people  hit that blue knob  and cool it down a little bit.  Cool it down a little.  Have them cool it down a little bit.  This is fucking  Can I feel it?  Blazing hot.  Oh, be careful.  Oh, my God.  It's like lava.  You can't even hold it  with the fucking  Starbucks thing around it.  What is this called?  The sleeve?  The fucking condom.  So what were you saying  about this?  I'm saying like  he  I guess they hired him 
[00:19:00]  because they thought  it was going to be  outrageous and dangerous.  Like even the  promo poster  it's, you know  Him with the hose?  No, no.  The one with Sharon  and Howie Mandel  putting their fingers  over his mouth.  You know, it's like  Oh, look, look.  Oh, now.  Watch out what he'll say.  Look out.  Can you go back  to that picture?  I couldn't help myself  and I had a tweet  and noticed his head  has to be bigger  than everyone else's  in the promo shot.  Well, yeah. 
[00:19:30]  But it's like  that's just it.  There's nothing dangerous  or outrageous being said.  But then again  the show isn't supposed  to be that  which is fine.  No.  But they're promoing  it that way  and I don't know.  It was uncomfortable  to watch me being  I've been a Stern fan  for, you know  since the fucking  1984 WNBC days  and it just seems  very odd.  I'm not saying  good or bad  or anything.  It was odd  to see this  incarnation.  But that means  you're jealous. 
[00:20:00]  Give me your opinion  means you're jealous.  I'm jealous  that he gets  to sit next to Sharon.  Yeah.  So I would just talk  about Ozzy  on the commercial breaks.  That's all I would do  is ask Ozzy questions.  She'd be so annoyed  with you.  But the reason  these judge shows  work is because  you got the one  kind of prickly guy.  Yeah.  So who's the prickly guy  out of those three?  Was it supposed to be him  but he's decided  I'm going to show America  that I'm actually  a nice guy  which there's been  rumors of forever.  I think he's trying  to show America  look I'm a nice guy.  That's not the formula 
[00:20:30]  that has been working  over the years.  Piers Morgan  was kind of a cunt.  Yeah.  And then he would  play off Howie  and they legitimately  really didn't like  each other  so there was a  back and forth going  and then Sharon  calmed everybody down.  You know?  What was the Howie Mandel  flying in on a jetpack  last night too?  I don't know.  I didn't see that.  They showed Howard  get out of an Escalade  and then Sharon  get out of an Escalade  and then you see  a jetpack guy fly over  and everyone's like  woo woo  and then the jetpack  guy lands  there's an obvious cut  and then Howie Mandel 
[00:21:00]  takes the helmet off.  It's like why  were they trying to  He's a space guy  or something.  No Chip  I don't think he  is a space guy.  I guess they were  going for something  a little different.  I don't know what  they were going for though.  Like a different  that he  that's how he arrives.  I think  here's what I think.  Oh boy.  I think  it was Howie Mandel  and them telling Howie  like look  you're still on the forefront  how about you arrive  on a jetpack  just so everybody  looks and goes  alright Howard Stern's  on here but  Howie Mandel 
[00:21:30]  you're still the man.  Well stupid Howie Mandel  allowed Howard to just  push him completely  out of the whole thing.  I wish I could talk  about fucking mucus  just invading  my fucking  soft palate.  I liked Howie on this show  but I did watch  the first episode  and it was an hour  of Howard Stern  and Howie Mandel  was literally just  pushed to the side.  Yeah well I guess  they're trying to  establish him.  They're trying to  establish him yeah.  Just trying to get  their sea legs.  Oh boy.  I don't watch this show 
[00:22:00]  regardless of who's on it.  I liked it.  I never  I liked it.  I liked the  I liked the past seasons.  I don't know.  I honestly don't know  if I'm going to watch.  Maybe when  they get further along  and you know  get rid of the goof acts.  Yeah.  But  yeah I just  I don't know.  There was some  black guy dancing  last night  that was pretty good.  He was just pulling  all those weird moves.  He was doing this thing  where it looked like  he was running  in slow motion  on the stage.  Really?  It was fucking cool.  Yeah.  That was pretty good. 
[00:22:30]  Did you see the dinosaurs?  No.  The first night  where they turn off  all the lights  in the theater?  No I didn't see that one.  That shit was fucked up.  That was kind of cool.  Yeah Holmes.  I don't know  how I've spoken to him.  He wore homeless  and shit.  Is he wearing a hat?  And this was  a dream come true  for him.  Is that his hat?  No it's his hair.  He dislocates his  shoulders and shit.  I would have like  $150 in my pocket.  Where's he from?  I want to go get  a hotel room for you.  I want to just 
[00:23:00]  dance and practice  to the same thing though.  And believe it or not  I would actually  dance on him.  Uh huh.  Alright enough  to get to know you.  That was some  fucked up hair.  Yeah huh.  You know what?  He's got to talk  to everybody.  Welcome to America's Got Talent.  Thank you very much.  And what's your name?  My name is Alonzo Jones 
[00:23:30]  but all my friends  and family call me  Turf.  Turf.  Yes.  Yo Turf.  I am a very  extreme contortionist  dancer.  Woo!  You know  I've been walking  around San Francisco  and you see a lot  of guys on the street  who do have talent.  You know  I guess you're just  waiting for their  lucky break.  Yes sir.  We all out.  He's walking around  San Francisco.  Put you down  in a cup or  something like that?  Uh yeah.  People donate.  I see some of my  tippers out here.  How you doing?  You make enough  money to live.  He's a panhandler. 
[00:24:00]  You have a house?  You have an apartment?  Something like that?  I was actually  homeless for two years  before I got my apartment.  Just dancing on the streets.  Just doing what I had  to do with it.  But yeah  dancing 100%.  Alright so you're  committed to this  and this is what  you're going to do.  Alright well I wish  you the best of luck.  Thank you.  Good luck Kirk.  Although it pauses  real quick.  That is what a radio  guy does.  Just ask questions.  Yeah yeah that is true.  Howie's a comic  and Sharon has been  there for a while  but that's just 
[00:24:30]  what somebody who's  been asking questions  for 30 years does.  Yeah yeah.  Just fire out  fucking 50 questions  and try to get  something going.  Try to get the guy  to have any prostitute  of themselves  or something.  I suck dicks Howard  and I do it for money.  That's how I get  my money.  I like this song.  Yeah.  This guy's a good shit.  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  Watch he kind of 
[00:25:00]  gets into this whole thing.  What the fuck?  Isn't that fucked up?  I can do that.  That's easy.  He's walking slow.  Head can walk slow.  But how fucked up is that?  It looks like  he's on a wire.  Yeah that's weird.  Pretty good.  He's just walking.  Yeah he dislocates  his fucking shoulders  and shit.  I'd hate to be shirtless  if I'm like that.  Ow!  Did I look like it hurt? 
[00:25:30]  Now we're just  listening to a song.  That's all they're  hearing out there.  Yeah we're watching  this guy contort himself.  It's pretty uh  He's popping his shoulder  out of its socket  it looks like.  I will say that walk  was pretty fucking impressive.  Yeah the walk  was pretty good.  Was this the highlight  of the night?  Yeah that was it.  He pretty much just  dislocates his shoulders now.  I guess we like  the show after all.  Well to sit through  all the drivel  to watch this one guy  dance around  for two minutes.  Well there is a lot  of nonsense but 
[00:26:00]  Oh man.  That slow walk  was pretty impressive.  I will acknowledge  I enjoyed that a great deal.  It really looked like  he was on a wire.  and uh  you know being  suspended over the stage  a little bit.  That guy's very entertaining.  I don't know how many  long he can dance for  but that's a one man  show in Vegas.  Yeah right.  He put some chicks  around him.  He goes boom boom boom  he contorts like a penis  he goes between the legs.  That's why  that's why in the end  this show is really dumb  because  you realize  there's maybe 
[00:26:30]  four  five acts in the end  that could pull it off  in Vegas.  It's so obvious  like the granny thing  that's not going to  ever happen.  The rest of them suck.  Huh?  Yeah what's granny  going to do?  You just know.  She'd do very well  at the Apollo.  Granny G.  She would get a standing  ovation at the Apollo.  Oh she would.  Yeah.  They'd be freaking out  standing on the seats  punching the air.  Crazy.  That's crying with your  girl or something.  Yeah you got very emotional.  Boom boom boom.  That's cool.  Yeah that wasn't too bad.  Other than that though  I didn't see anything 
[00:27:00]  that was entertaining.  Someone just  fixed my picture  with Clinton.  They put your  your face  on my ex.  It's fucking  hilarious.  I think I might  frame that  and put it in my house.  Please give me a copy.  I'll frame it too.  Let me see  how horrible that is.  What they should do 
[00:27:30]  People are working  on my Clinton photo.  What they should do  is put my apnea mask  face over your ex.  So it looks like  you and Bill Clinton  are standing  with that new superhero.  Fuck I might  Apnea boy.  Apnea boy?  Is that  I might frame that one.  That's great.  Apnea boy.  A-X-H-X-C-X  on Twitter.  Thank you very much.  You think this guy  is going to be popular  after this?  Yeah.  Yeah, he'll go a long way.  Dancing all over the place.  Yeah.  It's marvelous.  He'll just be dancing 
[00:28:00]  like a madman  or something.  I'm not born with it, Anthony.  We used to say that  all the time.  Got the rhythm.  While they were  getting us hors d'oeuvres.  Rating's down  for America's Got Talent, huh?  Oh, boy.  But there's a lot  of spinning going on.  Well, they said  they're in a different  time slot now  than they used to be  instead of being teamed up  with the force.  Instead of reruns,  they're up against  some tough competition, so.  Yeah, they started earlier.  Yeah.  This season.  Down significantly.  God bless them.  What are you going to do?  I got no end in my city.  I like that guy.  He was very entertaining.  Yeah.  Good street performer. 
[00:28:30]  That's where Jesse,  what was his name?  Ah, don't talk about that guy.  That's where he was from.  San Francisco street performer.  They had some  talented guys out there.  I still listen  to that guy's stuff.  What was his name?  Jesse Morris.  Oh, that was a runner.  Jesse Morris.  I wonder if they have  better street performers  out there  because it's warmer year-round.  Then again,  it's chilly in San Francisco.  It's because it's  a very liberal city  that allows it.  Oh, maybe.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  They allow their homeless  to sleep right where they are.  He's not homeless,  though, this guy, right?  No, I'm just saying  in general,  I'm going with Ant's Point. 
[00:29:00]  Every time I go to San Francisco,  you go in and out  of some nicer places  and the homeless  are literally  right in front of the place.  And they just,  they're not mad at all.  They just let it be.  Oh, yeah.  They're like New York  where they round them up.  They do round them up.  Round them up.  They round them up  as far as, you know,  keeping them away  from where people  are spending a lot of money.  Yeah.  Henry Winkler, by the way,  might play an aging porn star  on Broadway.  Wow.  He would come in  to promote that.  Of course he would. 
[00:29:30]  That would be a lot of fun.  Yeah.  Interesting.  It's not the Hank Zizler character  that he writes about.  Oh, right.  No, I didn't just read that.  I remembered it.  And just looked  to see if my eyes  started down.  They did not.  I know.  You did not.  We got Obama on The View.  We got Troy Kwan  admitting getting snowballed.  Oh, man.  We got Jay-Z  talking about gay marriage  and the economy.  What show is that on?  It's after Opie and Anthony Live.  Oh, right, right, right.  Yep.  That clip show.  It's the clip show  of the Opie and Anthony show.  And then on the after show, 
[00:30:00]  they play clips  and highlights  from our show, right?  Oh, no, that's right.  It's a whole different show  with interviews.  Yeah.  Where all the guys  are now saving  their best stuff  for after we're on.  It's just about exactly.  Why didn't we have Troy Kwan  talking about getting snowballed?  Troy Kwan snowballed.  Danny fucking fat chicks.  You didn't ask them  the questions.  Yeah.  Well, how about they tell us  they got something?  They don't tell me  they have something.  I just ask them questions  until something happens.  Sam digs.  Sam gets that.  You're getting some great stuff  for your show. 
[00:30:30]  For your show.  We have compelling people  working for this show.  You just have to sit them down  and talk to them.  And then when I saw Lampanelli  fucking giving him, like, props.  Was that real?  Yes.  Yes, it was.  Fuck.  What did she say?  Like, good job.  Yeah, she said I did a good job  when I interviewed her.  Good job on the interview.  When we played that clip.  And I just read that one.  Oh, great.  That's fucking Mr. Ego  loses shit on that one.  What is she going to say?  She's pretty polite.  That's true.  She has social grace.  She went out of her way  to say it. 
[00:31:00]  I just think it's because  he's black.  She does like the blacks.  And gay.  Yeah, right?  She's her entire audience.  He's a black gay man.  Entire audience and bed.  She did get a lot of tweets  back to her saying  that's because he's half black.  Oh, really?  Oh, okay.  I didn't think I was breaking  any new ground there.  All right, well then,  let's listen to Troy Kwan  from the after show.  What is the official name  of that show?  I know we all have  our own names.  After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[00:31:30]  Is it really?  Yep.  That's what it's called?  I call it Sammy the Twat.  Sammy the Twat.  Well, Troy Kwan decided  why give O&A this story?  Right.  This story.  You got to talk to him.  We talk to him?  He'll tell you.  Yeah.  He comes in here  and talks about fucking,  you know, whatever.  How about he slides  this little note and goes,  hey, I got a snowball story  whenever you want to get to it.  He's got a ton of stories.  Well, how about the next time?  He can give you a book of notes.  Well, next time,  how about he gives us one  instead of always giving you shit? 
[00:32:00]  If he comes in here  and you just start talking to him.  Sam is saying that basically  he got it out of him  and we have neglected to do so.  Sam's basically trying to say  he got it out of him  because he's a better broadcaster  than all of us.  No.  That's what he's subtly saying  here today.  I don't actually do content  on my show.  You guys actually talk about this.  Troy Kwan,  why not give us  the snowball story?  Why give it to Sam?  I'll talk to you guys  about anything.  You guys just got to ask.  Oh, boy.  We don't have time to ask.  We got so much shit to do.  I don't have anything to do,  so I'd end up talking  to these guys.  Yeah.  You don't have any pressure. 
[00:32:30]  It's just a quick hang,  like, oh, that was a cool show.  Right.  So, you know,  you're just kind of hanging.  We got to get into some stuff.  I get to talk to Troy  for like 25 minutes  and then eventually  the snowball thing comes up.  See, we can't talk  to Troy Kwan for 25 minutes.  No offense.  Stop.  We got a lot of things  to cover in one show.  I love talking to Troy.  He's a good dude.  Thanks, Jen.  You want to play  the snowball clip  from the after show?  When did he get snowballed?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Damn, my crotch again.  He's doing it.  Yeah, the snowball.  I don't know why people  get so grossed out 
[00:33:00]  of her jizz.  It's yours.  Did you ever taste it?  The context.  Yeah.  I should mention was that  Danny was talking  about fucking fleshlights  and saying that the problem  is that you have to clean them  and I asked him about  using them without cleaning them  and he said, yeah,  he's fucked a fleshlight  with his own cum in it.  And I said, that's disgusting.  That is gross.  And then Troy said,  if it's all dried up  and shit.  Dude, that's horrible.  It was like fresh.  Well, how long after?  It was fresh.  Yeah, that's kind of gross.  Like real quick after. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, so you do it twice?  Yeah.  He just, he fucked a fleshlight  better than a real girl.  Yeah.  Wow.  Danny could probably never  fuck a real girl  twice in a row.  Now Danny's running down the hall.  All this stuff happened  after our show.  Where's this juicy  little midget rump?  Danny has a midget rump.  Jimmy said you have  a midget rump.  A juicy little midget rump.  He said you have a midget rump.  It's so not compact.  That's nice.  I don't care what it is.  So what?  You could come twice in how long?  In a fleshlight. 
[00:34:00]  Is this an interview?  Yeah, why not?  In a fleshlight.  I don't really remember.  I just, I remember grabbing it,  I guess beating,  pounding one out,  and then, I don't know,  like 15, 20 minutes later  you're just like,  fuck it.  I could either go for it  or clean it.  That's a dull day, man.  There was nothing going on  that day, right?  Yeah, it was probably  snowing outside or something.  How old are you?  I've seen this episode.  31.  Man, my turnaround time  is not like that anymore.  I think what happened  was Danny looked in the fridge  and realized there was  an extra six-pack  and he had to celebrate somehow. 
[00:34:30]  But you're like,  you're feeling your own cum in there?  Well, it's in there, yeah.  Or is it to the back of it?  It's probably to the back of it, Sam.  He probably doesn't even really feel it.  I bet he feels it.  With a fleshlight,  you want to use,  like you can't fuck it dry,  so you got to use something.  So it's moist  and there's juices in there anyway.  Yeah, that's a little rough.  It's just drippings.  Right.  Is the fleshlight that good?  The fuck?  Yeah.  It really is, huh?  Yeah, I need to get a new one,  but yeah.  I think I want to try it.  Wore it out already? 
[00:35:00]  Well, like, you know,  you can't really,  you shouldn't be leaving  anything in there.  Yeah, yeah,  you got to clean it out.  But then there's nothing more degrading  after you cum  than having to clean out  your receptacle.  Does your cum break down  the plastic?  It doesn't break.  Is it latex plastic?  What is it?  It rots.  That's what I mean.  I don't know what it is.  It just starts breaking down.  Oh, and it crumbles.  Oh, God.  It's the worst smell in the world.  Oh, man.  Oh, God.  Brown, dried up jizz.  Why don't you clean it?  Oh, yeah.  It turns brown.  Why don't you clean it? 
[00:35:30]  It's just rotting life.  Ugh, it's disgusting.  Rotting life.  It really looks like a mass grave.  Why don't you clean it?  Because I was lazy.  That's why I fucked it twice.  Isn't it easy to clean?  Don't you turn it inside out  or something?  Yeah, you just shove it.  Well, it's like Kevin Smith  was saying.  You just kind of,  you kind of just  put it in the dishwasher.  No, you just shove it  onto the end of the faucet.  All right.  Yeah, let the water  shoot through it.  Let it go.  Like a nozzle.  I think I want to try this.  I was skeptical 
[00:36:00]  and I thought I was going to,  I was like,  who's going to,  why am I going to fuck this?  Do you feel stupid?  You do it first  until you realize  that it fucking,  it's not bad.  Feels good?  Yeah.  I might try this.  How do we get fleshlights?  I'm sure we could get a box full.  Yeah, but I want to get paid too.  We should have everybody  on the show  fuck fleshlights.  I would fuck one.  Years ago,  Dice presented me  on the road  with,  I forget what he called it,  the sleeve.  All right, the sleeve.  The primitive fleshlight. 
[00:36:30]  But that was,  yeah,  it was actually  a pretty good jerk-off sleeve.  Yeah, I mean,  there's been a ton  of these things,  obviously,  but,  and I've tried a few of them,  believe it or not.  But,  dude,  the fleshlight is no joke.  I enjoy the fleshlight.  I gotta try it.  It is a very cool,  masterful try it.  Danny tried to justify it  and say it wasn't that gross.  It's like coming  and then it gurgles over  so it still touches your dick,  but I told them,  no.  Sam's going,  ew,  ew,  ew.  Well,  it's gross  because it's like  using your own jizz  for lube.  Right.  Yeah,  yeah.  So like,  what if you're on your back, 
[00:37:00]  you're beaten off right,  and now it's burbling over,  and you know,  it's your own stuff on you,  so what's the difference?  It's on you.  But then you don't jerk off again  and use it all over yourself.  What does it matter?  Yeah,  I don't see as that's a problem.  Yeah,  who cares?  I think it's gross.  No,  you know why you think it's gross?  Because you don't,  because you have to use rubbers  with your chick.  See,  if you could just,  you ever just bang out your chick,  leave it in there,  and then you bang her out again.  It's the same thing.  I don't know which one.  She would clean before.  Get the fuck out of here.  No,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no, 
[00:37:30]  it's like,  you're not going to be like,  oh,  clean out your veg,  my cum's in there.  You just got to keep going.  You're like,  fuck it.  That's stupid,  right?  It's hot.  You just keep going,  whatever.  It's hot.  Yeah.  You get turned on by jizz a little bit.  If you leave a,  what?  You think he's probably like jizz?  A little bit.  He gets turned on by a little bit.  No,  no,  if it's my jizz,  who cares?  I don't understand why everybody,  and I guarantee every guy has tried tasting their own jizz.  I guarantee it.  All right,  well,  you're wrong,  because I haven't.  I've licked mine.  It's Jim Norton's Twitter avatar,  or it used to be.  Oh,  no,  that's a toilet I'm licking. 
[00:38:00]  Oh.  But I have licked my own jizz out of my hand on video for a girl.  I mean,  it's yours.  What's the big deal?  I have blown a load inside a girl,  and then for the recharge time,  I just spent a little time licking,  but I don't shove my tongue in there to try to gather up all my jizz goodness.  I lick the outside.  You are eating your own jizz.  But I do taste it.  Right,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  So I said that one time he came,  and it landed like on his lip,  and so he licked it off in his tongue.  Good range.  Wow.  Yeah,  I don't care. 
[00:38:30]  You know,  I used to drink my own piss on stage with my old band.  So it's just your own.  Gigi Allen.  It's your own fluid.  I would drink my own piss.  Yeah,  I would too.  I would do it right now.  Right now?  Well,  yeah,  but they're not going to let me do it.  Yeah,  but we should do it before the bosses get here.  Yeah,  but they're going to know.  I don't want to get in trouble for it.  It's supposed to be really healthy.  Yeah,  I used to.  Especially if you drink your own.  On stage,  I used to clamp my dick  and let the piss fly up in the air  and they'd catch it.  Wow.  That's fucking cool.  It's like the fountains at Disney.  Yeah.  They'd spit it on the crowd  and they'd get pissed.  I'm confused why you weren't a mainstream success. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  I don't know,  man.  I hope.  Because I know the Bieber does that,  too.  Yeah,  the Bieber does that.  He stole that.  I hope this happens to Sam,  by the way,  because we found out yesterday  he will be fucking  without condoms  after the wedding.  Sure.  I pray  for premature ejaculation.  Like,  you've been using rubbers  too long  so that when you feel  the goodness  of regular vagina  against your penis,  you just shoot  and do not satisfy her at all.  Maybe I should jerk off  the afternoon before, 
[00:39:30]  like right before the ceremony.  I hope you still just...  In between the ceremony  and the reception.  Just jerk off  in the bathroom.  Oh,  that would be great.  Sam,  it's time to take pictures.  Wait a sec,  real quick.  I'm just being a minute.  Oh,  would that be great?  Take a picture of this  and make a fucking lick it.  Oh,  Jesus.  Chip.  God.  I mean,  I don't know.  Now we have nothing to say.  Yes,  Danny?  I was going to say,  isn't it nice though  to be able to still do that?  Like,  it's one thing at like 15  to blow your load,  you know,  but like to still be able  to do that at like 30. 
[00:40:00]  Like,  I don't mind if it does happen.  I don't fucking mind  just to get that worked up  in your brain.  Oh my God.  Crazy,  right?  I'm glad I can still access  that shit.  So you can still access  where you just got to  fucking come instantly.  I don't mind that.  Nope.  So,  all right,  the snowballing.  Let's get back to that.  I don't know why  people get so grossed  out of her jizz.  It's yours.  Did you ever taste it?  Yeah,  of course.  Your own?  Yes.  What do you mean,  of course?  Yes.  What does it taste like?  Cum.  Yeah.  I don't know what cum  tastes like.  It's like mucusy.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What was the context 
[00:40:30]  in which you tasted it?  Which time?  How many times  have you tasted it?  A couple times.  What was your favorite?  Uh,  I like the wording on it.  Probably,  probably after being snowballed.  Okay,  so tell me how snowballing works.  Well,  I mean,  you finish it in somebody's mouth  and then they give it to you.  So you came in a girl's mouth.  Yeah.  After she was blowing you.  Yeah.  And then she comes up to your mouth  and open mouth kisses you  so that your cum now- 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, she wanted to do it.  I was like,  all right,  your cum goes from her mouth  into your mouth.  Yeah,  I don't really think  it's that big of a deal.  You liked it?  I've drank my own piss before.  I've never eaten my own shit,  but-  Did you think that when your cum  went into your mouth,  is that like sexy?  Uh,  it was pretty-  It was a hot scenario.  Yeah.  I just got nauseous.  There's no way I would do that.  No,  that's pretty fucking bad.  No fucking way.  If I told you who the girl was  that I did it with,  then you'd-  Real hot girl?  Yeah.  Who was it?  Who was it?  Something we know?  What color is her hair? 
[00:41:30]  Wait,  who is it?  Write it down.  Is she a blonde?  I don't want to say it on there.  That's fine.  Write it down.  Wait,  let me look it up.  But I don't know.  I'm thinking of like the hottest girl  you could like think of in your brain.  And it's still rough.  I couldn't do that,  man.  Does she work on Shade?  I couldn't do that.  Really?  No.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  You banged her?  Yeah.  And snowballed.  Are you still?  No,  no,  no,  no.  This was like 10 years ago.  What was the scenario?  Oh,  wow.  I don't give a fuck that no one knows the name,  but what was the scenario? 
[00:42:00]  Troy wins.  Yeah,  I guess.  But this,  I'd fucking kiss her if she showed up with cum in her mouth.  I don't,  I don't know what to say.  I just don't want,  I don't want to like,  I just don't want to say it on air because I don't,  I don't want to be disrespectful to her,  but disrespectful to her.  What are you talking about?  I mean,  she made a living off fucking being disrespectful.  You know what I mean?  Like,  I don't know.  No,  no,  no.  We all obviously know the person.  I have no idea what she is.  What?  You don't know who that is?  You're kidding,  right?  I'm looking at the name up there.  No.  No. 
[00:42:30]  You're kidding,  Jimmy.  No.  What's wrong with you?  Who is that?  Seriously?  Oh,  you fuck that?  Oh,  shit.  Okay.  Wow.  We hung out,  we hung out with famous people.  Troy Kwan.  We hung out for a period of time.  Oh,  you know what?  I believe Troy completely because she told a story.  This person told a story.  I'm not going to say who it is,  but with her husband where he did something similar and kissed her off of 
[00:43:00]  her and she liked it a lot.  So I know he's telling the truth.  All right.  Now that we know the girl,  the beautiful woman.  Wow.  Would you do that?  I still would.  Fuck yeah.  No,  no.  Absolutely.  No.  Absolutely.  I think everybody would.  Because that's also her hating men subtly.  That's her being dirty,  but that's also her punishing you for your treat.  That's like somebody likes to ride their Mercedes and they have a horse kick you in the chin as  you get out.  Wow.  So good boy.  Give us some details.  How'd you get with her? 
[00:43:30]  I mean,  if I,  that's going to completely,  let's just say,  were you at,  were you at a club?  Yeah.  I had done some,  been involved with her doing some stuff for a band I was in.  And we just became friends and then just started hanging out.  How long time did you fuck her?  A bunch.  Really?  Yeah.  We were,  we were hanging out for a couple of months.  What's that?  You guys must've been really good friends.  Yeah.  I mean,  she pals,  man,  right there.  Yeah.  Troy,  bros,  bros,  bros,  browing down. 
[00:44:00]  Someone's got to say,  Troy's a rock star.  Nah.  Cause if any one of us was with her,  with her,  we would be telling the world.  It was like 10 years ago.  That makes it even better.  10 years ago.  10 years ago.  Now that's really good.  Yeah.  No kidding.  10 years ago.  She was in her prime.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't you tell people?  How do you bring it up?  I don't want to,  you come across a little bit of a,  what's that?  Who that person?  Who it is.  I mean,  I don't know,  dude.  It's,  it's a little,  I don't know.  It's a weird thing.  I just,  I don't want to,  I don't want to,  are you guys still friends?  No,  no,  no,  no,  no,  we aren't.  But I just don't want to be, 
[00:44:30]  um,  I don't want to just be this because she's,  she's a really cool chick and I want to be disrespectful by talking about what happened on air.  What are you religious?  No,  no,  no,  I just don't want to,  I don't know.  We don't know her that well,  but I,  I,  I feel like she would be completely cool with you to say in her name.  We should try to get her on the show.  No,  no,  that's not,  why did you guys move on from each other?  It just,  you know,  it just would never work.  Why?  Oh,  because it's just,  you didn't have a blowout, 
[00:45:00]  did you?  No,  not at all.  No,  she's really cool.  I have nothing but respect.  The sex was good,  right?  Incredible.  Did you ever trade stories with what's his name?  Uh,  no,  but yeah.  Wait,  wait.  Oh,  fuck.  No,  no,  this was before,  that was pre that.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I would hope so.  So yeah,  way,  way before that.  Yeah.  You don't want to get in,  you know,  no,  that's another reason.  Tiger and his meal.  I'd like to,  I'd like to stay far away from that,  but is that the only famous girl you were with?  Uh, 
[00:45:30]  I mean a couple other porno chicks that aren't worth even mentioning.  But you just said a couple other,  you just,  you just fucked up a little bit.  You do realize that,  right?  Oh,  no,  you said a couple other porno chicks.  That's all right.  There's a lot of porno chicks.  We're looking at a porno chick that we all know.  So that narrows it down significantly.  But I'm sure you understand my reasoning for wanting to be,  to be a little,  little crazy.  I mean,  you know,  she suggests something.  It's like,  why not?  Why not try it?  You know,  I fucked Brie Olsen once and I,  and I,  and I was only mediocre and I couldn't get to the microphone fast enough to tell the world. 
[00:46:00]  I did blow.  I did blow it.  But that sort of started on the show though,  right?  I mean,  so I mean,  you know,  it's never fucked her again.  Why?  Would you,  if you were her?  Why?  As I look at Jimmy's luggage again.  Yeah.  If you look at the true Jim Lord,  I got to go guys.  No,  no,  Jimmy.  I'm pushing it now,  but I should.  We don't care.  Jimmy.  So I wish I could do it.  Troy,  your fucking rule. 
[00:46:30]  Wow.  All right.  So she's the one that snowballed you.  Oh,  stop shitting.  I'll see you Friday morning.  Have fun.  Unless I'm killed in a plane crash.  No,  shut up.  That shit.  He jokes one too many times.  All right.  Godspeed,  Jim Norton.  If I had known it was her,  I probably would have not thought it was that weird.  Huh?  If I had known it was her,  I probably would have not thought it was that weird.  I didn't even think.  No,  it is weird and it's fucking,  it's awful.  You don't want a chick spitting jizz back in your fucking mouth.  Sorry.  Yeah,  but if it's just like one time.  Yeah.  And it's her. 
[00:47:00]  Well,  I guarantee you.  I'll do it one time.  I'm not even put off by like the fact that maybe some jizz is going to get in your mouth.  Right.  You know,  your own jizz in some way,  shape or form during some sex points.  But to have her just take a mouthful like that and blatantly pump it back into your face.  Did you swallow it?  That's a problem.  Yeah,  of course.  You swallowed it?  Of course.  He's a trooper.  Fuck yeah.  See,  now I understand why it happened,  but yeah.  And I,  I'm,  I'm sure the,  same would happen for any,  any guy.  I wouldn't,  I wouldn't sit there and enjoy it. 
[00:47:30]  I mean,  I enjoyed the scenario.  You enjoyed how dirty it was.  Did you go,  no,  no,  just yummy.  Took it like a champ.  But yeah,  I mean,  it was,  it was a hot scenario.  Why not?  What if a caller guesses who it is and we give him a fine prize for guessing?  Killing me,  dude.  I think the callers can pretty easily guess who it is.  Yeah.  But that makes you like a rock star.  Yeah,  but then I just,  people know.  There's not a guy I know that wouldn't fucking run to that microphone and say who it was. 
[00:48:00]  I just,  I think that's,  I don't know.  Tacky.  A little tacky.  Did you give her a good one?  Did she enjoy it?  I was a young buck.  She came back for seconds,  didn't she?  Was she squealing?  Was she fake squealing or real squealing?  Like Sam Hurd in that hotel room?  You know,  I was,  I was like 21 years old,  so.  Oh,  wow.  A young buck.  You think she enjoyed it?  One of the young Turks.  I guess so.  I mean,  we hung out for a period of time.  Were you intimidated?  Very much so.  Very much so.  Not the whole time.  No, 
[00:48:30]  I mean,  it didn't stop you though.  No.  A little intimidation.  You just gotta step up to the plate.  But,  yeah,  it was fun.  You grabbed the bull by the giant tits.  I can't take that phone call  because it gives it away.  People know.  That's hilarious.  Out of respect for Troy.  You give us enough on this show  that I'm not gonna push you.  And you put together  everything that's been said.  It's who you think it is.  I will tell you this much.  For the newer listeners,  most of this stuff  comes out in the end anyway.  It really does.  Just give it a little time.  They know. 
[00:49:00]  It's who you think it is.  Will you shut up?  It's who you think it is.  It's who you think it is.  Now you're just being a dick.  I'm keeping it cool.  Yeah,  but Troy,  am I keeping it cool?  You're keeping it very cool.  Yeah,  of course.  I wouldn't expect nothing less  from him other than being a dick.  You're kind of being a dick now.  I'm not being a dick.  It's out there.  Most people probably  have a good idea,  but just leave it like that.  And I have no problem  telling stories  and I'll tell you guys anything,  but it's just like,  it's just out of respect  for another person.  How are those boobies?  Fun.  I always liked her implants.  Most implants suck. 
[00:49:30]  They really do.  Now you're really crazy.  Now he's being the guy.  Why?  Why?  Most porn stars have fucking...  Yeah,  you know,  help me out.  You're adding...  No,  I'm not going to help you.  A little bit.  A little bit,  Opie.  You're the bigger dick.  Every porn star  has breast implants  and we've seen a million of them.  Nope.  Oh,  come on,  man.  I'm sorry,  Troy.  Dude,  I don't care,  man.  I'm trying to be cool.  I'm trying to be cool.  Like an LOL  at fake discreet Opie.  People are calling you out.  I'll be honest, 
[00:50:00]  I didn't mean to do that  in that way.  I was just saying.  I was just commenting.  I always liked that.  Right,  it's a little tacky.  I wasn't being fake there,  I swear at it.  There are times I do go down that road.  Why don't we just have  E-Rock whisper it in your headphones.  You heard that.  Fucking,  I couldn't believe him.  What happened?  You heard it on the radio.  I totally heard it on the radio.  What happened?  Loud and clear.  I don't know what happened.  I wasn't listening yesterday.  We were talking about  fucking fat chicks  and coming back  to my old apartment  because we used to have  crazy parties  at my old apartment  and there was a party 
[00:50:30]  and Eric had whispered  something in my headphones  about one of the parties  that we had  and it just went  blatantly over the air.  Really?  Yeah.  He didn't really whisper it  into the headphones.  No,  he said it very loudly.  He was like,  I'm not sure if Troy  wants this out  or something,  you know,  but I already wants  to talk about it  and everyone's like,  okay,  what?  And he goes,  okay,  well,  I'll tell you  in your headphones  and they could just hear  over the air.  And you heard exactly  what he said.  I heard exactly  what he said.  And what was it?  Something about age. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah,  he said,  I don't know  if she was of age.  The girls were age appropriate.  Oh,  that's good.  And then he was like,  well,  it didn't go over the air  and I was like,  well,  then how did we all  hear it in the studio?  I liked Troy's  gang banging  the retard story.  Jesus Christ.  A little slow.  Well,  she was a little,  just a little slow.  Was she the best  you ever had?  Yeah.  Overrated?  Where are you at with that?  It's hard to say,  man,  because I was so young.  You know what I mean?  It was just,  you don't really know 
[00:51:30]  what you're doing.  You didn't understand.  Everything is great  at that age.  Yeah,  you just don't really  understand the magnitude  of how it is.  You don't understand  how amazing it is  because you're just  young and full of cum.  You're just like.  Yeah,  yeah,  no appreciation  of what you got right there.  No,  you don't know how to,  you have no idea  what you're doing.  You just,  it's just like a jackhammer.  Did she tell you  what to do?  Insert,  pump,  repeat.  I mean,  she was,  you know.  Instructional?  Yeah.  All holes?  No.  No.  Two out of three?  Yeah.  Did you lick her ass?  Of course.  Yeah.  You gotta do that. 
[00:52:00]  That's like the  fucking entrance exam.  It really is like  the fucking,  you know,  buy the ticket,  get in the park.  Yeah.  Yeah,  of course,  with that,  you have to.  You just,  you gotta go for whatever.  You gotta go for broke.  You know?  Yeah,  yeah,  I hear you.  Good for you,  man.  You gotta put yourself over  more than other guys.  You gotta be willing  to do things.  Now,  the whole snowball thing,  I think that's more novelty  than true pleasure  with a girl.  Yeah.  I think it's like,  hey,  look what I'm doing. 
[00:52:30]  He's eating his own cum.  As opposed to  getting a girl  and,  you know,  doing things  where she's really  digging it  and it's things  that most guys  probably don't do.  Right.  But you know,  she has the power  to make you do it.  I think,  I think he would do it.  She's getting a high  or something.  How was it?  The psychology of it.  Sure.  I can do this to this guy.  How was the fit?  The fit?  A lot of people might think.  Oh,  it was really nice.  Really?  Yeah.  Hey.  Yeah.  Hey,  if I can sit. 
[00:53:00]  Hey.  God,  Troy just stopped the show.  I think we're all impressed.  I guarantee you guys would have.  It takes a lot to impress us,  Troy.  I guarantee both you guys  would have done  the exact same thing I did.  I'm not,  you know,  now that I know the,  I won't,  I won't deny that,  but I would be like,  ugh,  what the fuck?  To be honest with you,  first of all,  very beautiful,  but not my type.  Why?  Really?  I,  you know me.  You never,  you never?  Not my type.  I think she's gorgeous.  10 years ago?  Of course. 
[00:53:30]  Holy fuck.  I'd fuck the shit out of her.  10 years ago, yeah.  I'm not saying that,  but that's not really my type.  You know me.  Show her 10 years ago.  I'm white trash all over.  That's pretty,  that's actually pretty close to it,  I think.  What year?  About 2012?  I mean,  2002.  99,  2000.  Oh,  wow.  So you're talking like,  oh,  Jesus.  Yeah.  Wow.  Pretty good right there.  God damn it.  Troy Quarland.  That's probably pretty accurate.  Because she has that,  like,  look,  you know,  it's that look of,  of a pro. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  And I don't really go for that.  Is she a little thicker than you like?  No,  no,  she's fine.  I get what I'm saying.  That's fine.  When the hair's a little too bleached out.  Yeah.  It's like,  a little too plastic.  You don't even have to squint much to see that.  That's Pamela Anderson looking.  Okay.  What?  Both of you are way bigger dicks.  What are you talking about?  Way bigger dicks.  Sam,  we're just discussing.  Yeah,  you're a big dick too,  though.  Wow.  We're discussing.  You started the ball rolling.  We're just discussing.  Yeah.  No,  you are the one.  No,  you like and don't like from our porn girls. 
[00:54:30]  You started the snowball rolling.  We're keeping a secret.  We have totally kept a secret,  Sam.  We're good.  You guys are way bigger dicks.  You tested the waters for them.  Now they're just fucking.  Yeah,  but guess what?  It was warm.  Yeah.  We're good,  man.  All right.  So there it is.  A little snowball.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See,  Sam,  we got a little more.  Did you know it was her?  No.  On the after show?  Uh-huh.  See,  we're better broadcasters in the after show.  See what we got?  Look at the info we got.  I thought your years of experience had proven that.  I didn't realize you were still on this quest to prove that you're better than me. 
[00:55:00]  To prove that we're better than Sam Roberts.  Look,  I might be panicking a little bit.  Yeah.  In my older years,  all right?  I'm fairly secure that you are both.  But I can still hit it out of the park.  Hugely better broadcasters than me.  Oh,  well.  For the record.  Even with the shits?  Even with the shits and the coughs.  And no voice.  Yeah,  it's great.  I've been holding in something,  which makes it hard to talk.  Yeah,  you're squirming over there.  Oh,  God.  Holy shit.  You percolating?  I don't know what. 
[00:55:30]  It's just like,  I don't know.  Fuck.  Man,  you got mulch inside you?  Yeah.  Mulch.  That was the last one.  It was mulch.  Mulch.  Like shredded weed.  All right.  Should we break?  Yeah,  I got food in front of me.  What the fuck?  Where were we?  Doesn't matter,  does it?  Did we do any good radio?  Yeah,  we did a lot of good radio.  Oh,  good.  Talking about all your ailments  and Troy getting cum in his mouth. 
[00:56:00]  Those Fox News girls.  Uh-huh.  Fox News just has great fucking looking women  working for their stations.  And they're not too stupid.  No,  no,  no.  Pretty good.  But they blow away CNN's people.  Or MSNBC is just a bunch of fucking slobs.  A bunch of fucking women that want to look like men.  Uh,  Rachel Maddow?  Yeah.  Was that a shot at Rachel?  It was totally a shot at Rachel Manow.  I got it.  I love saying it. 
[00:56:30]  I mean,  it's so obvious.  She just wants to go on TV as a boy  and they won't let her.  No,  they try to gussy up.  She hates that she has to kind of look like a woman.  She hates it.  She's terrible.  Because all you have to do is Google image her  to see what she looks like  before she got the big gig.  Yeah.  She wants to walk around this world as a boy.  Yeah.  And there's nothing wrong with that  if that's what she wants.  I don't even give a fuck.  I just think it's hilarious  that she's forced to kind of like soften her look  to be on TV.  Yeah,  to be on TV.  That's what you gotta do. 
[00:57:00]  Dumb stuff makes me howl, though.  It's your job.  I'm pretty fucking impressed  by the Troy thing.  Oh,  that is pretty fucking impressive.  That's a great celebrity banging.  Yeah,  we almost had Veruca Salt.  So,  we're right there with Troy.  Me and Ann could have double fucking dated  the fucking Veruca Salt bruts.  Almost having a double date.  That's pretty good.  That's pretty good.  And we got one of their panties,  even.  So,  we're just like Troy.  Rock stars.  After what we heard,  just heard.  No,  no.  I know.  You ain't topping that.  Nah.  Not easily. 
[00:57:30]  No.  All right,  E-Rock,  do something.  Oh,  yeah.  It's time for a little story  about two fellas broin' down.  Sam is my bro.  I mean,  technically I'm on vacation.  And Troy,  you said yourself,  if you're not in Cleveland to party,  you shouldn't be in Cleveland.  Ha,  ha.  And when the party is broin' down in Cleveland,  you know what's poppin' off.  If you're sitting here naked with your dick out,  you're cool,  all right.  Yeah,  whatever.  All right, 
[00:58:00]  cool.  We on vacation,  baby.  And boys will be boys.  Sam,  go ahead and stick your finger in my butthole.  But all foreplay,  all the time,  makes Jack a dull boy.  Feel me?  Slow that shit down for a second.  I'm 34 years old,  man.  I know how to pace myself.  Dude,  you're fucking awesome at this.  You're doing really well.  Fuck yeah, 
[00:58:30]  bro.  Smash that ass.  Throw him down in Cleveland.  The only way we know how.  Dude,  you should teach a fucking class.  On the Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:59:00]  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Who can take a sunlight?  Who can take a sunlight?  Sprinkle it with you.  Sprinkle it with you.  Cover it with chocolate and a miracle or two.  The Candyman.  The Candyman.  Oh,  the Candyman can.  The Candyman can.  The Candyman can.  Does he make...  Get in topical.  Hold up. 
[00:59:30]  Wait a minute.  With the Sexman.  That sweeper's really loud.  Turn this up,  B-Rock.  It really is.  I guess we lost Sammy Davis Jr.  How long ago?  22 years ago.  22 years ago.  At the age of 64.  He could easily be alive today.  What I was asking Anna,  Mike,  I don't...  I remember the other version of this song.  Oh,  right,  right.  Well,  you put it as one of our greatest bits ever, 
[01:00:00]  B-Rock,  being a fanboy.  Yes.  Really?  The K-K-K...  That one?  Can't do it anymore,  but yes.  You can't even do it on satellite radio.  You can't even do it on your own podcast.  Nope.  You can barely do it in your own home.  The Most Offensive Song Contest is one of our greatest achievements.  It was great when you had it done live, too.  Oh,  my God.  That was one of the best road shows ever.  Remember all the guys coming up and singing their Most Offensive...  Oh,  God,  I missed the old days.  Fuck. 
[01:00:30]  Fuck.  I forgot about that.  How many people were there?  A few thousand,  right?  Oh,  easily.  Like,  there were still people in the parking lot,  not just trying to pull in,  but crowding the parking lot because there was a standing room.  Yeah.  Those road shows were quite hectic because we didn't know what the fuck we were doing,  and we pulled it off every time.  We just pulled it off.  We had no plan.  Magic.  We had some ideas,  I guess.  We'd invite people,  and we'd put them on stage and just do shit.  Yeah. 
[01:01:00]  And then our chicks would be on the side of the stage with their arms folded all pissed off.  All pissy.  It's like,  go fucking shop.  Go home.  Leave me alone.  I'll say it again.  What do you think paid for everything?  Yeah.  Fucking asparagus up Madison's asshole.  I remember her name.  Yes,  Sam,  that's what we did as broadcasters.  Do you want some Sammy Davis on All in the Family?  I want to play some most offensive songs.  So badly. 
[01:01:30]  Can't.  Wish.  You don't think we can?  It was on regular radio.  I know.  Different time.  Ah,  yeah,  I remember the good old days.  Remember how clever some of the songs were?  They weren't all just down and dirty.  Brilliant.  Some were very,  very clever.  Why Sammy on All in the Family?  Just a good clip?  Just because we've played them throughout the years.  Is it an excuse to have the N-word on our show?  No,  these two didn't have the N-word.  Oh,  they were both inappropriate.  All right, 
[01:02:00]  let's hear it.  It's all right.  I can,  I can say,  Mr. Davis,  get out of here.  Now,  Mr. Davis,  do you take cream and sugar in your eye?  No.  That's great.  And we have this one, too.  Sorry,  Mr. Davis,  sometimes my father says wrong things.  Yeah,  I've noticed that.  But he's not a bad guy,  Mr. Davis.  I mean,  like,  he'd never burn a cross on your lawn.  No,  but if he saw one burning, 
[01:02:30]  he's liable to toast a marshmallow on it.  Fuck,  that show is great.  Henson died 22 years ago today.  Wow.  So Sammy Davis Jr.  and Jim Henson on the same day,  huh?  And we talked about him yesterday.  Yeah.  And he had a dumb little,  what,  flu?  Yeah,  he got a flu and,  he didn't take care of it  because he was a workaholic  and next thing you know,  he died from something  that was obviously curable.  Yeah,  it's fucked up.  Jordan,  rookie of the year,  27 years ago. 
[01:03:00]  There's some good stuff today.  I know we usually don't do this,  but Beach Boys,  Pet Sounds,  46 years ago.  They say that album  is a masterpiece.  Why is it a masterpiece?  Why is that?  Have you heard it?  Yeah,  there's a bunch of pop songs on it.  It's a masterpiece.  When I think masterpiece,  I think like very intricate,  intricate,  intricate,  intricate.  Yeah.  It's an amazing album.  Why is it an amazing album?  There's nothing like it.  Listen to the songs on that album.  Yeah,  but they're all just hits. 
[01:03:30]  A lot of guys had albums  with a lot of hits,  but they weren't called masterpieces.  Yeah,  but they haven't held up  to this extent.  Why not?  Because they weren't masterpieces.  You like the Beach Boys.  I love the Beach Boys.  Oh,  wow.  Did you know that?  I didn't know he was a big  Beach Boys.  Why would you like the Beach Boys?  Listen to him.  You like Jay-Z and shit like that.  That's right.  The Blueprint is also a masterpiece.  No,  it's not.  No,  it's not.  No,  it's not.  Blueprint 1.  No,  Bob Dylan released  Blonde on Blonde  46 years ago.  What was the big song 
[01:04:00]  on that album?  I don't know my Dylan.  I know Dylan songs,  but I can't tell you  what albums they were on.  Someone will pop it up.  Yeah,  please help me out.  Rainy Day Woman.  Really?  I don't know.  I'm just reading.  You don't like Bob Dylan,  though,  do you?  No,  I wasn't a big fan  of the whole Bob Dylan thing.  Some of his songs,  though?  Not really.  Not even Rainy Day Woman?  Give me a little Rainy Day Woman.  Give me a little.  Let's turn Anthony on  to some Bob Dylan.  Yeah,  now. 
[01:04:30]  I know you've heard  the song many times,  I'm just saying.  What else is off this?  What?  Wait,  what?  Yeah.  What song is this?  The file says  Rainy Day Woman,  Bob Dylan,  and this is what's playing.  Oh,  boy.  I hate this.  I like pet sounds.  Oh,  that's a Dylan.  That's Dylan.  Dylan.  A lot of confusion. 
[01:05:00]  Is this Rainy Day Woman?  I believe so.  I thought this was...  Yeah?  Yeah.  I thought this was  a different title.  Why is it called  Rainy Day Woman?  Ah,  he did that.  I don't think  the word rain  is in the entire song.  I had no idea.  But I would not  feel so low. 
[01:05:30]  A musket.  Nothing,  huh?  No,  this doesn't  do me.  Why not Dylan?  It's that...  I didn't like him  when he got all  mumbling and shit.  Weird,  eclectic thing.  It was weird to you.  Yeah,  it's too eclectic.  And finally,  47 years ago today,  it's worth mentioning  SpaghettiOs went on sale.  Did you ever like  SpaghettiOs? 
[01:06:00]  That sauce is brutal.  It's horrendous.  It's like,  it's fluorescent orange.  Yeah.  And it's just terrible.  Remember,  it would dye everything?  Your skin,  your clothes,  you would never get  that shit out.  What was it made of?  Dopey kid with the  fucking orange lips.  And you couldn't  wipe that shit off.  I was a Chef Boyardee guy.  To this day,  to this day,  every once in a while,  I'll pick up a Chef Boyardee,  a ravioli.  Ravioli?  Every once in a while.  What's in that stuff? 
[01:06:30]  What is that meat?  I don't know.  It's missing meat.  That shit's gotta be like,  that's the bottom  of the meat ladder  as far as  when they make that shit.  When we were growing up,  we just assumed  it was all meat,  but now we're  very suspicious.  There's a lot of  fake meat out there.  I like beefarino.  Yeah.  Do you go  white trash  every once in a while?  I mean,  I'm saying  every once in a while.  I'll be in the supermarket.  I'm kind of hungry.  I'm like,  you know what?  I'm just gonna grab  a can of  fucking Chef Boyardee.  Go home,  I heat it up,  and then I put  a little  hot sauce on it, 
[01:07:00]  and I'm good to go.  I'm trying to think.  I don't think I do.  Nothing.  You eat anything  out of a can?  Well,  soup.  What kind of soup?  I don't know,  Progresso,  fucking chicken noodle.  Clamp chata?  Things like that.  I go red clam chata.  That's pretty good stuff  right there.  And had a clam chata.  That's right.  No,  I,  the trashiest I get  is like,  just the other day  I was getting a sandwich  from the deli,  and I was like,  you know what?  I'm going to finish this 
[01:07:30]  up with a yodel.  That's,  so like,  that's typical  Long Island.  It really is.  The delis are such  impulse buying places.  I miss the Long Island  delis.  They make good  sandwiches in New York,  but Long Island  had its own thing.  They took pride  in their sandwiches.  Oh,  hell yeah.  And then they always  had their hostess treats  right there.  Right there.  Right in front of you.  It's so easy.  You don't even have  to move your arm.  It's a flick of the wrist.  You grab your yodel,  you flip it up  on the fucking counter.  I laugh so hard 
[01:08:00]  because it just  brought back memories,  man.  I haven't,  I haven't done that  in so long.  You always would  finish it off  with some dumb  little treat  for yourself.  Fucking treat.  Little cookie treat  or a little bag  of chips.  What's that?  You know what I miss?  You get coffee  and orange juice  with this.  Oh,  right.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  The egg sandwich.  I don't want it.  You get a free coffee  and an orange juice  with this.  Mine was always,  could I have  two eggs over easy  on a roll  with ham  and cheese  and salt and pepper?  Okay. 
[01:08:30]  And then,  and then I'd get  ketchup on it.  Really?  And I'd be like,  I didn't order it  with ketchup.  And they'd say,  no,  you did.  And I'd yell at them  like,  no,  I don't like ketchup.  Why would I order  something I don't like?  Right.  Would I lose my mind  and decide,  oh,  I'm going to put ketchup  on it because I hate  ketchup and eggs.  Love ketchup on my eggs.  I don't mind ketchup.  Not like,  but I don't mind it  on scrambled eggs.  When you have a yolk,  a yolk-y egg  on a fucking sandwich,  you don't want  ketchup on that?  Yeah.  Oh,  it's crazy. 
[01:09:00]  You know,  I had to turn my chick  on to the buttered roll.  Oh,  man.  She's all in,  but people around  the country,  I don't think they  understand the buttered  roll like we do  from Long Island.  Yeah.  We're not talking about  you go to a fucking  restaurant and you get  a dumb roll  and you put a little  butter on it.  No,  no,  no.  This shit  was amazing.  Yeah.  The Long Island rolls,  I don't know how  they make them,  but I do.  I worked at  Dan's Bakery  in Central Islip  when I was a kid.  Really?  A kid.  Yeah, 
[01:09:30]  they fucking,  it's amazing.  You just take  the rolls,  the dough  before they really  rise and you have  dough fights  just throwing  at each other.  But it's cool.  They roll in  these huge conveyor belts.  Yeah.  And then,  you know the top  of a Kaiser Roll's  got that little  swirl in it?  A little twist.  There's a little  fucking butt plug  looking thing  that goes,  it twists down  on top and makes  that little mark.  That's it.  And then they take  them,  they stack them  in trays and put  them in this,  the room where  they rise.  Right.  And then they get  all,  you know,  whoa,  whoa, 
[01:10:00]  whoa.  And then they  fucking shove  them through the  oven.  And I tell you,  you think it's  fucking good when  you get it at the  store?  When that fucking  thing comes right  out of the oven,  they crack it open.  Put some butter  on that shit.  Oh my God,  it's so goddamn  good.  Philly's got some  good bread products.  They're right up  there,  but the Long Island  Roll,  holy fuck.  Yeah.  And I've lived  in a bunch of  different places,  Western New York,  Boston,  a few other joints,  and they just don't  even come close  to that roll.  Yeah.  It's just,  it's everything. 
[01:10:30]  It's the water.  I don't know what it is.  I don't know what it is  either.  It's just amazing.  I never understood  that.  If a food is good  in like a city,  why can't they make  that food just as  good in another  city?  Like I'm a big  cheesesteak fan  now that I got  roots in Philly.  I got roots in Philly,  so I love the Philly  cheesesteaks.  Locally made.  Every time I try to  get one in New York  City,  it's like,  why can't you guys  figure this out?  Why don't you just  make them down in  Philly and drive them  up the turnpike?  Ship them up.  Something.  Probably costs a lot. 
[01:11:00]  But what makes it  different?  New York pizza is the  same thing.  New York pizza?  You ain't finding  better pizza than New  York.  It just ain't gonna  happen.  Wings?  Yeah.  I like chicken wings,  but, you know,  Western New York,  there's something  different about it  when they make it  up there.  I don't know what  it is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wish I could talk.  Huh?  I wish I could talk.  This is just,  it's a chore.  It's funny,  you're trying to talk  and I swear I'm just  holding in shit.  You're holding in a 
[01:11:30]  big shit.  You poor guys.  I got some kind of  24-hour fucking bug in  my lower intestines,  I guess.  Don't fucking try to  tell me about Chicago  pizza, okay?  I like to...  It's not real pizza.  It's a whole different  thing.  But deep dish is amazing.  But it's a whole  different, it's not  pizza.  I've never been to  Chicago, I want to go  there badly, but  technically...  Where's the joint on  Jericho Turnport?  Chicago Pizza Pub.  You worked there,  right?  I worked there. 
[01:12:00]  I made your Chicago  deep dish pizza.  We used to go there.  Sucked.  I wonder if technically  you made my pizza once.  Well, probably not.  How old were you?  I was washing dishes.  How old were you?  Oh my God,  probably fucking 17,  18.  Okay.  Maybe.  I used to go there.  I used to love the  deep dish pizza.  It's different though,  you're right.  Yeah, it's not...  When you say pizza,  people think, you know,  New York pizza.  Chicago pizza is a  whole other animal.  No one makes it  anywhere else. 
[01:12:30]  You don't fucking  get it anywhere.  It's stupid, the cheese  and the fucking  tomatoes on top and  it's all watery.  You don't like all  that cheese?  No.  I could eat cheese  every day.  It's a thick crust.  It's like cake.  Oh God, every day I  could eat that shit.  A lot of cheese.  No, I don't like...  A lot of extra sauce.  Yeah, it's Chicago  pizza talk.  You got a fucking  problem?  You go extra sauce  on your pizza?  No, I don't do  extra anything.  Put a little on top.  I fucking like...  A little cup of  cold sauce on the  side and I dip  my pizza.  I like the way 
[01:13:00]  pizza comes out  of the fucking  oven.  Don't put that  pepper on it.  Don't put extra  shaky cheese on it.  The guy making the  pizza knows how to  make the fucking  pizza.  You don't.  They skip on the  sauce every time  with that ladle.  When they spread the  sauce with the ladle,  it's a little barren  in places.  It's pretty magical  though when they do  that little center  thing and they just  go, whoa, whoa,  whoa.  Fucking, they make  a little spiral and  the sauce actually  goes out.  I don't know how  they do it.  But to me, I'm like,  all right, now that was  cool and all, but now 
[01:13:30]  I'll add a little more  for me.  Make your own pie.  What's the pizza  joint in Huntington  with the cold cheese  on top?  Oh, no.  I forgot the name  of the place.  Across from the old  Fast Eddie's.  I am such a pizza  traditionalist.  Dude, it's the only  pizza joint that I  know of that does  this.  I've never seen  anyone else do it.  Regular slice, like  you know it and love  it.  And then they go,  you want some cold  cheese on top?  And you go, yeah.  For a little extra,  they just fucking 
[01:14:00]  throw cold cheese  right on top.  So then you've got  the hotness, the  coldness.  It's beautiful.  I'd say no.  Why?  I want fucking  pizza.  You still got pizza.  No.  With extra cheese,  but the top layer  is all cold.  Yeah.  It's delicious.  It's delicious.  It's delicious.  It's delicious.  Refreshing.  Like a good ziti pie  though, every so  often.  Oh, yeah?  It's like a fucking  dinner.  It's dinner.  It's not that  traditional.  One slice and it's 
[01:14:30]  dinner.  They put fucking  ziti on top of  pizza and then  cover it with  fucking  regat.  Regat.  Regat.  It's so fucking  good.  God damn it.  What shouldn't be  on a pizza?  I don't like your  Hawaiian pineapple  shit.  Whoa.  Hey, come on now.  Where are you at  with chicken pizza?  Chicken pizza.  I love chicken.  I eat chicken all  the fucking time.  I don't know what  happens when you put  chicken on top of  pizza.  I'm not a big fan of  the chicken pizza.  It fucking sucks.  I'm the same way. 
[01:15:00]  Onions?  Fuck that shit.  Yeah, no.  Onions suck in  general.  Yeah, I don't like  that.  Especially cooked  onions.  Veggie pizzas.  And anyone who  fucking still thinks  it's 1950 and gets  anchovies on pizza is  an asshole.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  Does your dad do  that?  No.  He's an anchovy  fan, isn't he?  No.  He likes pepperoni  pizza.  Traditionalist.  Pepperoni pizza  gets a little greasy.  Wow.  You know, my in-laws,  including my wife,  likes anchovies. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, no.  And what was the  only one you just  said?  Sardines.  And sardines.  I look at them like  you guys...  Is that a Philly  thing?  No, I think it's  the...  I don't know.  I love seafood.  I can't even...  I can't.  Yeah, yeah.  That's...  It smells way too  fucking fishy.  It smells hard.  It smells like it  went bad.  Well, they put those  dumb anchovies on a  Greek salad every  once in a while.  Because I just  thought...  Overpowering.  It just...  And then I try to  take the anchovies  off.  I can't eat the  fucking salad.  That's how much I  hate anchovies.  Terrible. 
[01:16:00]  But these guys,  when I'm down in  Philly, they just  gobble them up.  I don't understand  it.  It's horrible.  I don't see it.  I don't get it  either.  I don't want it.  Little Vincent's in  Huntington.  Thank you, George.  All right.  If you're ever in  Huntington, you know...  Well, you should go to  FH Riley's, of course.  Well, of course.  But if you're on a  tight budget, go to  Little Vincent's and  get the cold pizza on  top.  Check it out for  yourself.  Or have a slice after  dinner.  Yeah, a little after  dinner slice.  Why not?  There you go.  After dinner slice. 
[01:16:30]  A little slice.  Have a dinner, have  some drinks, and then  once the appetite comes  back, have a slice for  yourself.  This guy's explained...  Bill goes, cheesesteaks  taste best in Philly  because of the bread.  I get that.  So why can't they move  the bread up the  turnpike every day?  That probably costs a lot.  I would assume that  there would be big  business in getting a  traditional Philly  cheesesteak somewhere  in New York.  Because then you have  to reheat the bread  probably.  No.  Maybe you just throw  it in a toaster when  you make it?  I don't know.  You do realize I've  gone back and forth  to Philly, no joke, 
[01:17:00]  at least 200 times  now in the last  eight years.  Can you just throw  a sandwich in?  It's not that far.  Yeah.  It's less than two  hours.  You can have the  fresh Philly bread in  New York making  cheesesteaks.  But for some reason,  people can't figure  that out.  How about just the  fixings?  Huh?  How about you just  get the stuff that  they make the shit  out of and bring it  all up?  I don't know what it  is.  I've never understood  that.  I say water.  You think it's just  the water?  I think it's just  water.  Once again,  bring the bread up.  Or get a whole bunch 
[01:17:30]  of water.  Just bring the bread  up, mate.  It'll stay fresh for  the day.  Morning noises.  What's this, Sam?  Well, you talked a  while back about all  the noises that you  make when you first  turn on the mic.  A lot of people don't  hear that because it  starts right at 6 a.m.  You've got to listen  from the very beginning.  Oh.  What?  We start at 6.  Of course we do.  I'm sitting right  here at 6 a.m.  That's all I know.  Right.  6 a.m.  Right.  But yeah, and so you  wanted a montage of all 
[01:18:00]  the different noises you  make and Troy put it to  music like he does  sometimes.  Yeah, I don't remember  when we were doing  fucking point stars.  What?  Blonde.  Okay, that's really  direct.  I just don't remember  making noises when we  were doing afternoon  drive.  I guess because we  haven't talked yet.  I guess that's what it's  about.  You still have that  just woke up voice.  You're testing out your  voice to see if it even  works.  Right.  Like I've driven here  the whole way and if 
[01:18:30]  you know stereotypical  people that can't drive  don't get in my way.  Chinese.  I don't talk.  Asians.  So I'm not sure if I  could even fucking talk.  You should sing in the  car.  That's what I do.  Oh yeah?  That must be a treat.  Actually I've heard him  sing karaoke at my place.  Oh yeah.  Is he good?  Yeah, he's got like  balls.  He was singing some  zombie.  Rob Zombie.  So let's hear it.  Oh man, it's crazy.  Bring some of this shit  in so we don't have to  make up crap.  We're just making up  crap right now.  You're doing a good  job.  Love it.  Because we're 
[01:19:00]  broadcasters.  Professional.  All right, so Troy took  all, these are noises we  actually start the show  with.  Start the show with  almost every morning  and then Troy did a  little something with  it.  Yeah.  We should do a montage  of the first things we  say when these mics go  on.  Oh, that would be funny.  Because even after all  these years, it's just  dumb little noises.  Noises.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  Ah, bah, bah, bah, bah,  bah, bah.  How we doing this  morning? 
[01:19:30]  Ah, bah, bah, bah, bah,  make sure all the  tones aren't there.  Let's do it.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  Ah, bah, bah, bah, bah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yep.  Yep, yep, yep, yep,  yep, yep, yep, yep,  yep, yep, yep, yep, yep,  yep, yep, yep, yep, yep,  yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep,  You've got to feel it out.  You're feeling it out.  Get some lows.  Get some highs.  Get some lows.  Get some highs.  Welcome, welcome, welcome aboard.  Welcome aboard.  Oh, it's too short. 
[01:20:00]  That's good.  You wanted to keep going.  Yes.  Yeah, I definitely could use a little more of that.  Can you make it longer?  Yeah.  We didn't do those noises for the bit.  That's just dumb, stupid shit they say when the mics go on.  Yeah, find a few more.  Please.  Extended disco version.  There's a Philly cheesesteak place in the city.  I'm aware.  99 miles to Philly?  I'm aware.  I'm aware.  They want to send cheesesteaks into the show.  Oh, okay.  We'll give them a chance.  You're going to do it like what?  Tell them they're going to have to give me a little of that. 
[01:20:30]  We'll give them a chance.  Like, hey, we'll, you know, we'll let them send free food to us.  Yeah, but if we mention their place, which we just did, I now expect a little envelope  with a little something in it.  Oh, shit.  That's not how that works.  That's payola.  That's how it used to work when I worked for the mafia.  So you want to have them in tomorrow or Friday, bring sandwiches, and then you can see if  they're on to something or not?  Yeah.  If they're...  Oh, there we go.  If you're...  That was the one?  Holy shit, yeah.  That was the one?  That was the one.  For this fucking five minutes? 
[01:21:00]  That was the one.  Oh, God.  Yeah, we want, uh, definitely we want some cheesesteaks.  Do you want it tomorrow or do you want to celebrate on Friday?  And if other cities want to get involved, that'd be great.  Like, you know, a deep dish pizza.  It has to be New York-based.  Trying to do, like, another city's food.  So is this tomorrow or Friday for the celebration of Friday?  Whenever the fuck they want to do it, man.  Let's do this.  Please, let's do this.  All right.  You don't know what a cheesesteak is, really, do you? 
[01:21:30]  No, I've had a cheesesteak in Philly.  Did you like it?  They're fucking good.  They're amazing.  Yeah, yeah.  You know you can't eat too many of those.  Those things are really bad for you.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  I don't know.  I'm amazed that these people aren't dropping dead all over the place.  It really is astounding.  The one thing is that I've noticed about Philly, and we lived in Boston, so I've lived in New  York, Boston, and Philly.  That's three big fucking cities on the East Coast.  And Philly is the most unhealthiest city. 
[01:22:00]  These people just refuse to eat healthy.  Yeah, yeah.  They refuse to have vegetables.  Animals.  They barely have salad.  It's amazing.  And it's wherever I go.  Yeah.  Just amazing.  Boston, they kind of ate, you know.  Boston, they were pretty good.  Yeah, yeah.  They don't have one of those.  What's their food?  I don't even know, and we lived there for over three years.  Lobster and chowder.  Lobster rolls.  I want to let everybody know that lobster is our food. 
[01:22:30]  It's our culture.  It's our background.  Shut up.  Lobster.  Lobster and clam chowder.  Is that their thing?  Yeah, they love that shit.  You like Long Island clam chowder where they mixed the two?  Are you kidding me?  You don't know that?  I've never heard that in my life.  You don't know that?  Don't know that.  Long Island's trying to get in on the chowder business.  You didn't know this?  And they get pissed off that they're so close to Manhattan.  So it's Manhattan.  You don't know this?  But then you go across the Sound and up and stuff, and then you got New England. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah, because across the Sound, they got to New England, and to the west there, they  got Manhattan.  So you mix them.  Long Island has decided, let's get this fucking Long Island chowder thing going.  You don't know this?  I have not heard this.  They mixed the two.  How is it?  It's all right.  Any good?  Yeah, I don't really go for it much.  I don't like creamy soups.  I've never been a big creamy soup guy.  I love a good creamy fucking tomato, like fucking...  Yeah?  Yeah.  So now we need Long Island chowder.  I've never heard of it. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, it's...  People are saying, right?  People are saying.  People are saying.  Also, people are saying, apparently Troy loves a good creamy soup.  Yeah, he does.  That's very funny.  Troy and his cream soup.  So stupid Boston is all about the lobster?  Yeah.  They got something else.  What's their food?  Isn't it lobster?  I guess.  Yeah.  Boston's like lobster, right?  That's like their food.  Clam chowder.  Clam chowder, though, too.  Yeah.  You ever...  The chowder. 
[01:24:00]  You've been in the Caribbean.  Baked beans?  Baked?  Oh, yeah.  Boston baked beans.  Do you have those videos still?  Oh, fuck yeah.  I actually do.  Those would go viral.  They're on tape, though.  They're on a fucking...  Well, you better hurry up and put it on something else.  I know.  We poured a lot of baked beans on a very, very young, hot, naked woman.  On a couple of them.  And for some reason, it was really fucking hot, even though it was baked beans.  And then the place we worked in Massachusetts there had fucking showers in the bathroom one 
[01:24:30]  floor down.  So we used to just take the girls.  They could get as fucking messy as they wanted because we could just take them downstairs...  And make sure they got clean.  ...and throw them in the shower and video that.  Did you?  Oh, fuck yeah.  That's awesome.  Oh, it was great.  Sam, I feel bad that you're starting your broadcasting career this past year.  I had digital...  I was setting up digital cameras like fucking old Ansel Adams fucking shit.  It was like...  It was like...  Huge tripod. 
[01:25:00]  Giant fucking old digital cameras.  I feel bad for you youngsters.  You're not going to be able to do shit with your radio shows.  All I can do is hope that the golden era comes back, but it won't.  Oh, blue tarp cabaret.  Yeah, I was about to say that.  We started a bit, just called the blue tarp cabaret.  We would break it out every once in a while and just do disgusting shit on it.  You'd lay a blue tarp in the studio.  So you could get as messy as you want.  And debauchery would happen on that blue tarp.  We did...  Naked girls.  We did boob art way before anyone was doing boob art. 
[01:25:30]  Did you get strippers or did girls just come in?  Oh, both.  Wow.  But a lot of times it was just girls.  Yeah.  It was great.  But you would get...  Girls would just be like, yeah, I'll come down.  Yeah, well, you got these girls and they would just, you know, they would try to make some  kind of art with their boobs.  Just use their boobs.  Opie, I am so happy I was married at the time.  So...  Because Paris had thought I could have fucked so many of those girls.  But thank God I was married.  You don't want to get tied up in all that.  No, no.  Thank God I actually went, you know what?  I better not because I'm married and I don't want to fuck up this one. 
[01:26:00]  Wonderful marriage I'm in.  I wake up in the middle of the night.  In cold sweats screaming like me?  Yes, yes.  You beat me to it.  Oh, okay.  I thought you were going somewhere else.  No, I'm not even joking.  I'm going, God, all that lost time.  Oh, my God.  All that lost time.  All that lost fucking pussy.  I don't give a fuck.  We've told these stories a million times.  I just don't care because they make me laugh every fucking time.  I'll never forget the time we, you know, we had a good connection with, was it Ten's Show Club? 
[01:26:30]  Ten's Show Club.  And they're like, they're always inviting us there.  And every once in a while, maybe me and Ann would stop in after a gig.  Yeah.  Before we had to be home.  But one time, the whole crew, we had a whole crew we used to hang out with up there.  We all went to the strip club.  And my girl at the time was like, yeah, this will be fun, you know, something a little different, maybe a little naughty.  Oh, boy.  Right.  And walked in, girl's naked all over the fucking place.  And my girl, it was her idea. 
[01:27:00]  I actually was being cool about it.  I'm like, you're sure you're all right with this?  She's like, yeah, let's do this.  I'm like, all right.  Go in.  Girl's naked everywhere.  I'm looking, of course.  And she's giving me the dirtiest look ever.  I'm like, so now I'm just, and I know I've told this a million times, but I swear it is as true as the first time I said this.  I stared at a beer tap for an hour because it wasn't worth the hassle.  Yeah, yeah.  It just wasn't worth it.  If she saw you looking, there was going to be problems.  But then I'm moving.  But then after I was staring at the beer tap for a little while, I realized if I move around a little bit, I could kind of see what is now called Instagram. 
[01:27:30]  I could see, like, the naked girls through all sorts of crazy filters.  And then I'm kind of moving as the girls were moving, so I could kind of follow the action through the beer tap.  Meanwhile, my wife's looking, thinking maybe we could take one home.  Not the worst thing in the world for you.  I'm real healthy for the relationship.  Have that work out for you. 
[01:28:00]  Have that work out for you.  Oh, that's right.  She was the one that pushed you guys down that road to begin with, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was that chick fucking, it was a gig.  I think you were there at that gig we were doing.  Oh, the BAB gig, of course.  We were saying goodbye to everybody.  I was like, take it easy.  I'm like, yeah, where are you going, man?  This is our going away party.  Yeah, that's right.  We're never going to see these people again.  We got to, let's hang.  I'm like, well, see that girl over there?  She just asked if she could come home with me and the fucking wife and watch us fuck. 
[01:28:30]  So I have to really go now, like right now.  It left like a cartoon character.  I left, I left the smoke trail.  It was already winding up before you even know.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you heard that.  He actually went from, I think I'm going to, he never said leave because he was gone.  Yeah, yeah.  Gone.  I got to get it.  I got to get it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  How's that song go again?  Yeah.  That was great.  Got it.  The dancer from America's Got Talent. 
[01:29:00]  I got it.  I don't remember.  Could he got it?  What?  The Buckeye Peeps.  Oh, oh, got to get git.  Got to get git.  Got to get git.  Yeah.  Git git.  Man, that was, yeah, she started that whole shindig.  That was a good one.  Until she realized, it's like, hey, how come he fucks the girl?  Hmm.  I don't get this.  See, he's having sex with her.  And I'm not involved.  I'm not really involved.  And I'm cooking eggs downstairs. 
[01:29:30]  I always kept her at arm's length.  Like, I would just diddle a little bit.  F-d-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l.  Meanwhile, I'm giving it my all to the stranger.  To the stranger in the bed.  And you're reaching as far as you can.  And you're going, hooly-hoo.  Hooly-hoo.  A toodley-toodley-doo.  Like you're playing the harp.  This is way over here.  I'm way over here.  It's like, yeah, I'm giving her some attention.  Sorry.  There's a brand new stranger girl in bed. 
[01:30:00]  What am I supposed to do?  You know, I just realized something.  Brooklyn Decker blew us off, huh?  Oh.  Something happens with this show.  Every day, Roland comes to us and goes.  Hey, somebody.  He does that a lot.  And through emails and through sign language, he asks us if we want certain people on the show.  And we say yes to a lot of people.  Yeah.  And then you forget you said yes until you see the person on TV and you realize, oh, I guess they blew us off.  We've had Brooklyn Decker on before. 
[01:30:30]  She's cool as shit.  Yes, we have.  So I guess today was going to be the Brooklyn Decker day.  But she said no to us?  I gather not.  She's not doing radio.  Yeah, because radio just sucks, right?  I don't think so.  This is still kind of powerful.  We don't get to do the blue tarp cabaret anymore.  No.  Today, we get three penthouse girls that will just sit there and we're not allowed to do shit.  I'd rather get to know them.  Yeah, of course.  Their personalities and what they like and don't like than maybe them being completely naked and shoving shit inside them. 
[01:31:00]  She blows us off?  No, she's not doing radio because there's now a lot more morning shows.  So her morning got filled with all TV.  But these TV shows, I swear to you, a lot of these dumb morning TV shows, we have a bigger audience.  I know.  But in the old school.  You'll back me up on that, right?  But for some reason, they think TV has more people.  They do a morning shitty news show that has like 5,000 viewers.  Per 100.  And they just, they're used to TV. 
[01:31:30]  It's too bad.  And they don't realize that radio audiences are more loyal than TV audiences are anyway.  No, what's this?  What's that?  The gray.  Liam Neeson.  Wasn't this movie shitty?  No, I heard it was good.  Where he kills wolves.  Terrifically exciting.  Hold on tight.  It's a true call of the wild.  Yeah, the wolves go, aww.  And then he's like, fuck with me.  He goes, whoosh.  I wish they did put Roland's quotes on the bottom of TV boxes.  No kidding.  Heard it was great.  Where he kills wolves.  He goes, aww. 
[01:32:00]  I gotta see that.  Why is he killing wolves?  Because they're trying to eat them.  Yeah, but why is he out there with the wolves?  I've never been out there with the wolves.  His plane crashes.  Yeah, bad shit happens.  So he has to kill them.  Oh.  And then he breaks bottles, like the little alcohol bottles from the plane.  Oh, wow.  And then he puts them, and he tapes them to his knuckles.  Thanks, Roland.  Oh, so you've seen this movie?  No, I've seen the trailer 100,000 times.  Is it dumb?  No, he tapes broken bottles to his knuckles, and then he's like, let's fight, wolves.  Wow, that's pretty badass.  I have razor-finger fists.  That is badass.  Fuck you. 
[01:32:30]  I was watching that fucking Bobcat Goldthwait movie, which was really great.  We blew him off.  I know.  God.  No, it's out of respect for Jay Moore.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  It really is.  Why?  Because, well, I let Jay say this.  Oh.  He said it on the air before.  Jay's married to his ex.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Is that a problem?  Yeah, well, it is because he's still pretty much an asshole.  Oh.  I don't know.  It's Jay's.  Well, yeah.  But I respect for Jay. 
[01:33:00]  I put forth that we don't take him, but I'm just one voice.  Yeah, that God Bless America movie.  What is it?  And it's fucking, it's actually Joel Murray, Bill Murray's younger brother.  Do we know him from anything else?  Yeah, yeah.  He's been in a couple of those wacky 80s movies and shit like that.  But he's really good in this one.  And especially the beginning of the movie, it's such a great commentary on what we're  living in these days.  Really?  And he's just disgusted by it. 
[01:33:30]  And they do a whole thing on shock jocks that is fucking brilliant.  It's so goddamn right on the money and these dumb reality shows.  Wait, wait, I liked it.  I want to slow you down for a second.  So he does the shock jock thing?  Do we look like assholes?  Uh, well, well, yeah, he's listening to the radio as he's driving and listening.  And then he gets to work and people are discussing like the morning radio shows they were listening  to.  And, and it's just horrid shock jocky shit. 
[01:34:00]  Stuff we've done?  Oh yeah, yeah, absolutely.  No, dude, it's so well done.  It was so funny.  I couldn't stop laughing.  Like, this is perfect.  And the movie itself is good?  Yeah, I liked it.  It gets a little, it gets a little weird toward the end.  It gets a little kind of, um, like I've seen it before kind of thing and a little outrageous  and unrealistic, but it's a dark comedy.  It's funny.  Um, and, and I liked, uh, the whole way that they got to the end. 
[01:34:30]  How do we get this movie?  Can you get me a copy?  I think on demand.  Yeah, it's on demand.  But you could, you could probably get a copy.  Yeah.  Can you get it for the weekend?  Yeah, I'll email him today.  How about I get it today?  So do you want Bobcats?  You want to get Bobcats?  It's a Jay Moore move.  For real.  Jay's been loyal to us forever.  If Jay don't give a fuck.  World's Greatest Dad is good too, is another one of his movies.  I think, um, who's in that one?  Fucking.  That broad.  Um.  She was in that other movie. 
[01:35:00]  Um.  That we kind of liked.  Um.  Robin Williams.  Yeah, that broad.  Thanks.  Tootsie.  Well, Tootsie.  Yes, yes.  That's what I was getting at.  Oh no, uh, Ms. Doubtfire.  I mean, yeah.  Tootsie was, uh.  Oh, right.  Right.  Um.  Dustin Hoffman.  Yeah, it was a, I liked it though.  Can we see the trailer for, uh.  No, put on the other trailer.  God bless America.  Yeah.  Ah.  Did this get good reviews rolling?  The most hilarious ringtone ever. 
[01:35:30]  Just text B-I-G.  God, it's bad.  God, it's bad.  We have a press that just gives them a free pass.  The boys were caught after setting the homeless man on fire.  Did you mother f***ing poop in my food?  What?  You poop!  So there's a tampon at her.  That's bad girls club.  Their own version though.  A tumor this size is very dangerous.  Do you have any family?  Oh.  Gotta take this.  Frank has had enough. 
[01:36:00]  I didn't know.  I live in Virginia Beach and everyone loves me because I'm so pretty.  I wanted an Escalade.  This is the biggest day of my life and you're f***ing up, Kelly.  It's like super sweet 16.  Hey, creepy.  Isn't the schoolgirl thing a little played out?  Don't move and don't make a sound.  If you want the car, just take it.  My parents got me the wrong one anyways.  Yeah, that's a f***ing tragedy.  Did you just kill Chloe?  Oz.  Did he really?  Oh yeah.  Holy f***.  Oh yeah, this is brutal. 
[01:36:30]  Can you guys tell me who riffs my cock off?  The Kardashians.  People who use rockstar as an adjective.  Women who call their tits the girls.  Anyone who wears crystals.  You're aiming at the bear, right?  This is the best day ever.  Yeah, it gets brutal.  Frank, don't.  Let me.  I'm recording this.  Thanks for turning off your cell phone.  You're welcome.  Just got it. 
[01:37:00]  We lose it as much.  If we're no longer interested in being civilized.  Hey buddy, what's wrong?  A lot.  A lot of crazy people out there.  I only want to kill people who deserve to die.  We gonna do this or what?  I know it's not normal to want to kill.  So what?  He befriends some young girl?  Yeah.  And they start killing people together?  Yeah, they go on a little tear.  But the whole thing leading up to it is him just disgusted with pop culture. 
[01:37:30]  And they do such a good job of portraying what's going on with social media and reality shows and fucking American Idol and things like that.  I liked it.  I thought it was really good.  All right, give me a copy, Roland.  So what?  Bobcat has some talent?  Yeah, apparently so.  You know?  I listened to the interview he did with Ron.  And it was really good. 
[01:38:00]  Ron, he's just fucking great at doing interviews.  I love Mr. Bennington.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  I'm falling down.  They already did it.  I prefer Mickey and Mallory better.  I said, well, you know, I'm not saying, look, I'm just saying I liked the movie.  It's not a new concept.  No.  And you can't just say anything anymore.  No, there has to be a negative criticism to everything.  It's the world we live in. 
[01:38:30]  I fucking, yeah, exactly.  It really is the world we live in.  Because people don't think it's a value to just be like, oh, yeah, yeah, maybe I will  check that out.  You know what?  That's got some value to that statement, too.  You know what, dude?  What?  At this point, you're just like, what?  You're not smarter than anyone for criticizing something.  Some asshole was giving me shit last night saying about the Howard thing.  Like, oh, you're just jealous.  And all I was doing was commenting on what I was seeing on America's Got Talent and talking 
[01:39:00]  as a longtime Howard Stern fan and watching him on that, which is, you know, we already  went over that.  Listen to the replay.  But he started giving me shit like, you're just jealous because you're a nobody and you've  tried your whole career to be somebody.  I'm like, I'm not even going to argue this guy's point.  So I just, like, found his Instagram, found a picture of his fat wife, posted it, and  just said, ha ha, your wife's fat.  He locked his fucking account.  Did he?  Yeah.  Fucking pussy.  That's why a lot of these guys are angry.  Yeah.  I laugh when they say you're nobody, really. 
[01:39:30]  I think we've kind of proven ourselves.  Yeah, yeah.  At this point.  If we were going to be honest with each other, did we wish we were bigger?  Sure.  But anyone in entertainment wishes that.  But in the end, I think this was amazing.  If you're going to start bashing online, you best get your ducks in order and make sure  you don't have any pictures of your fat fuck wife online or your ugly kids or you're a fucking 
[01:40:00]  piece of shit because, you know, it comes out.  Yeah.  I've noticed that in our dumb little world, a lot of people just have had it with the  dumb haters in general.  Yeah, yeah.  The fuck would have had it?  Yeah, it is fucking ridiculous.  I don't know if I would like that gig.  Merk has got talent.  Yeah, you would.  No, I don't know.  The exposure would be amazing.  Yeah.  It's easy.  Yeah, I think it'd be awesome.  It's an easy fucking gig, right? 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know, though.  It's going to be stressful to have to be something that you're kind of not.  I don't know.  Hey, that's really, you know what?  You're an inspiration.  I can't picture myself saying that.  You're a true inspiration.  Oh, you think he's faking that?  Yes.  Yes.  That means you're jealous.  God.  Don't check your Twitter.  That means you're jealous.  Yeah.  I would get over it for the 20 million.  How could you bash people when that old XM radio commercial is still on YouTube? 
[01:41:00]  Which one?  Oh, yeah.  Which one?  I don't care.  I kind of like the commercials.  I didn't mind them.  Which one?  Us with the dress?  If you're going to try to bash us, bring up XFL.  Yeah.  That was a let's do this for the money and nothing else.  Everyone's got opinions.  That's fine.  But I didn't mind the ONA commercial we did with the fat broad.  No, I liked it. 
[01:41:30]  And the other one I didn't mind with Jimmy entering as a million different people.  That was hilarious.  I didn't mind those two at all.  Yeah.  God, this looks like a movie, man.  We were part of a 30 second movie.  That took us so long to shoot.  I wonder if she's still hot.  No, no.  She's just fat.  You think?  I don't know.  She was so pretty in the face.  Mornings on WB.  Can you play from the beginning?  Remember that?  Oh, wow. 
[01:42:00]  Fat girl.  Trying on a dress.  So what do you think?  Does this dress make me look a little fat?  No, definitely not.  It's your huge ass that makes you look fat.  What?  O.P. and Anthony.  They belong on the radio.  18 mornings on WBCN.  Ooh, remember that?  Boston.  Thank you.  Come again.  Well, she did ask.  It's fine. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, what's wrong with that?  I don't mind at all.  Topey radio commercial.  The star is Bill Murray's brother.  We said that.  This guy goes, I saw God Bless America.  The star is Bill Murray's brother.  Oh, my God.  We know.  Holy mother of fuck.  Yeah.  What's wrong with you?  That was one of my sick movies I watched when I was laid up.  Must be nice to watch movies.  My God.  I watched a lot of movies.  I finally caught up totally on Game of Thrones, which is like fucking holy shit. 
[01:43:00]  Really?  I got to start from the beginning.  I just, boy, that fucking show kills more kids than SIDS.  They don't give a fuck.  They're all in.  They just don't care.  I don't mind shows that are all in, though.  Yeah, I like that.  So.  Yep.  All right.  We'll take a break.  We got.  Do you know that movie's directed by the guy from Police Academy?  Who?  What?  Just wanted to let you know.  Bobcat Goldthwait.  God Bless America?  Yeah, yeah.  Just in case you didn't know.  Bill Murray's brother is in it.  Is he? 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  He's a star.  Well, I didn't know that.  Do you know the guy from Police Academy directed it and wrote it?  Who?  Right.  God, people, we get it.  People are dumb.  Donald Trump.  They're your people, though.  Oh, I hate them.  You got your people in front of you.  Yeah.  On that screen.  I'm a peeps.  We all got our peeps.  Donald Trump Jr. in studio in a few minutes with a big fucking camera crew, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah?  Where's this going to take us?  None of this shit takes us anywhere, Sam.  To the Trump YouTube channel.  We got a nice little fucking thing on UFC. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  That was nice.  That was good.  So maybe we get a little exposure with Donald Trump Jr.  Yeah.  Or maybe not.  He'll be in at 8.30 and then we got the Broads coming in at 9.30.  The Broads.  Including Justine Jolie.  Oh.  She's the Broad that E-Rock spanked so fucking hard.  Maybe Eric could smack the shit out of her again.  Can you play that again?  It'll be nice to see her and Troy back together again.  Really?  Is that who it was?  Ah, I was kidding. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, man.  No.  It's really...  I almost had you.  I thought I was going to say it.  Because you started the first...  I did.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  So why don't you play you smacking the shit out of Justine Jolie?  That is a good one.  She was pissed.  She was so mad.  She's never recovered from this.  I remember like she was beyond cool.  Then this happened and now she comes in here.  Is this true?  As a bit tougher.  That's all I'm saying.  Did Jim Jeffries say he'd cut her shit out of her ass? 
[01:45:00]  Yes, he did.  Oh, you want to play that instead?  Jeffries was fucking...  He was hammered.  How long is the Jim Jeffries clip?  Hold on.  Oh, he was brutal.  I loved it.  Because that's hilarious.  Jim Jeffries was in rare form.  Jim is great.  He didn't really bond with Justine Jolie.  No, not at all.  And those two went back and forth.  When's he going to be back in town?  We've got to get him back on the show.  He is the best.  Fucking guy's great.  Love Jim Jeffries. 
[01:45:30]  Love him.  Oh.  What?  We're going to break?  Yeah, I'm just waiting for E-Rock to find that clip.  I can't...  I'm looking for the Jim Jeffries one.  I have the production that we made for it, or I have me spanking Justine Jolie right now.  Yeah, we should do the spanking then.  What about the production piece?  Can you do both?  We'll do both.  All right.  Oh, I like that.  Ah!  Oh!  Ow!  Oh!  Mother fucker!  Mother fuck you!  E-Rock!  You cocksucker! 
[01:46:00]  Are you shitting me?  She's fair-skinned too, you know?  Oh my God!  Son of a bitch!  Do you know how to fucking spank a girl, you douchebag?  Dude, you're supposed to tap.  This is the first time I've done it.  It's not like you're beating women up.  Fuck not.  Ooh!  You don't...  See, here I was all thinking, Annie got cracked too.  You should say no to crack, man.  How?  Holy shit!  Didn't even get the whole ass cheek.  Went for the fucking crotch too.  I think... 
[01:46:30]  Son of a bitch!  The Opie and Anthony Network brings you the hottest new primetime dating game show.  Presenting Unmatchables, where two completely incompatible people are locked in a room and  forced to make awkward conversation.  How old are you?  Did you say that?  I'm almost 30.  You're almost 30?  Well, you look very good.  You look very pretty.  Watch the season premiere as Australian comedian and drunkard Jim Jeffries attempts to seduce  American adult starlet Justine Jolie.  Hey, you'll learn to love me.  Over time, you will love me.  Will Justine be impressed by Jim's plush living arrangements? 
[01:47:00]  I have a studio flat in L.A. which has a pungent smell that I can't find.  But I'm going to endeavor to find that.  And then you'll get quite the raping.  Wow.  That was a joke.  Come on.  That was funny.  Look, I've got a little accent.  Will Jim be able to woo Justine with his thoughts of romance?  I don't like kissing girls, right?  I used to like kissing girls when I was like 14 or 15.  But then after I got my dick sucked, I was over kissing.  Kissing is now a dead zone for me.  That's really unfortunate because that's one of the main things that I really enjoy about a man. 
[01:47:30]  Or his thoughts on making love.  I'd rather have a threesome that involves a guy and a girl because I like seeing the cock  going into her mouth as I'm fucking her.  I just like seeing a girl being degraded.  Oh, degraded.  Oh, he stopped himself before he said it.  I said degraded, you slut.  Can Jim Jeffries turn it all around?  I love you.  And I mean that.  I love you.  I've never been in love before.  Probably not.  I would eat your poo.  That's a good thing, Jim.  It's not a good thing for you.  No, but it would be hilarious to fucking watch.  I'm going to dig it out with a knife. 
[01:48:00]  Find out just how incompatible these two are.  Why does he hate me so much?  I don't hate you.  I'm just having fun.  On the latest, greatest late-night dating game show only on the Opie and Anthony Network,  Unmatchables.  Yeah, always sexual tension.  We're mainly guests, man.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  We welcome Donald Trump Jr. to the Opie and Anthony Show.  I must say, a friend of the show.  Yes, absolutely.  It's good to be back. 
[01:48:30]  And they were making fun of me very recently.  We had Bob Kelly in here.  And I think it was Sam saying that I did not officially get the invite to go fly fishing  with Donald Trump Jr.  Yeah, Bob and me both said that.  Yeah.  Well, guess what happened?  You just did.  Guess what happened outside the studio a mere two minutes ago, Sam?  Who started the conversation?  I got the invite to go fly fishing.  Oh, jeez.  You caught a crap on the parade.  He did initiate.  He did initiate.  But it was not an invite-yourself situation.  He was talking about a friend of ours that we know up there. 
[01:49:00]  Richie.  Yeah, we stuck a pig in front of Richie two weekends ago.  Really?  It was pretty funny.  He was guiding also, so it's always fun to rub it into the guides when you're catching  fish and you're not seeing them do it.  Yeah, was he rock swimming up there?  Yes.  So that was pretty good.  But no, I gave him the invite for next weekend if he's around.  Which would be a hell of a way to celebrate my birthday.  Fly fishing with a Trump.  Oh, is he just throwing the hints out?  Now you're expecting him to get you a present.  You know, I've got to bring a present.  A Trump present.  Imagine a Trump present.  Do you feel the pressure of giving good presents? 
[01:49:30]  You know, there's times where you do, certainly for weddings, you know, you get the invite for  the wedding to the person you haven't seen since college 15 years ago.  And it's like, you know, they don't want me there either.  They want me there just to talk about the fact that I'm there, or they just want the  present.  I'm just like, I'm just not going for it.  Like, I basically don't go to weddings anymore if I'm not in the wedding party.  Oh, man.  Sam, you screwed up.  Sam's getting married in a couple of weeks, really.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  And, uh, yeah.  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  He's expecting fat checks from us. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  Oh, well, yeah.  But, you know, he works with you guys every day.  But every time he's a wise-ass, I'm knocking down his fat check just slightly.  Yeah, I no longer even like the show, so I don't have to write anything.  Yeah, exactly.  This will be my last official visit to the O&H show.  But getting back to Richie.  So Richie was tweeting these monster fucking fish.  Yeah, there's some pigs up there.  Getting me jealous, because last time I went, we caught, I did, when I was dragging my pole  in the water, a little fucking guppy, basically.  It was like a three-inch nothing.  Hey, at least you didn't get skunked.  No, I got skunked. 
[01:50:30]  Technically, I wasn't fishing when this thing decided to jump on my fly reel.  Oh, well, listen, you don't have to admit that.  I think you would like it.  I just think you would like it.  Listen, I'll take Ant shooting one day, because we can do that, whether it's go planes or do  some long range or whatever.  Did you ever like fishing?  No, I've had great experiences with my dad that kind of turned me off to the whole fishing  thing.  I remember when I was laying there seasick in the bottom of a rowboat on the Long Island  Sound with fucking crabs in my hair that he was using for bait, and it tipped over, 
[01:51:00]  and I woke up, knock it off, stop your crying.  All right.  Yeah, no, that's not the way to get little ones into it.  No, no.  I take my kid.  We have a pond near our country place, literally, you know, bring three worms, catch four fish  in ten minutes, and we're out.  You know what I mean?  And he's like, I just want to go back.  It's like training a dog.  Great experience.  Great experience, fast.  They don't even have a chance to get bored.  Oh, man.  But float down this river up there.  Yeah, it's one of these weird rivers where you don't see boats because it's private 
[01:51:30]  property or something, or it's hard to get on this river for whatever reason.  Yeah, and it's just some of the areas are just hard to wade, and there's private in between.  So, I mean, actually, Rich saved our ass last weekend because we were checking out a new  portion of the river, and my buddy, who I float with all the time, was like, no, we're  going to go from here to here.  So we start the float.  We run into Rich about, you know, like a long way into this thing where we're already like,  okay, where's the takeout?  He's like, yeah, you have like 12 more miles to go for that one.  Whoa.  So we hit a last-minute switch on the shuttle. 
[01:52:00]  We're able to get someone to, you know, move, you know, the trailer up to where he was taken  out, and otherwise we would have been floating until like 3 in the morning, and obviously  once it gets dark, there's not much fishing going on.  So, yeah, I owe him big.  And that's where I'm a pussy.  When it gets dark up there, it gets dark.  Really?  You can't see your hand in front of you.  Yeah, there's not much.  It's that type of fucking nature.  Although now it's cool with the green drakes going on, you can actually fish at dark, and  you basically listen to the sound of them feeding on the surface and try to place a  fly there for a little while.  So you fish into that first hour or two of dark.  Come on.  You're fishing for sound.  You're listening. 
[01:52:30]  You're almost listening, because there's a point, like you said, it gets dark, and you  can't really tell.  But, I mean, the pigs are, you know, these flies are like ping-pong balls, so the trout are  gorging on them.  So they're there, but they only hatch at night, and it's pretty intense.  Could you explain the guy that harvests eels up there?  Richie was trying to tell me.  I was trying to tell Ann, I just couldn't, I didn't know how to explain it.  Yeah, he's got like the last eel weir on the Delaware, and it was a big thing back when  people used to eat a smoked eel.  Yeah.  You know, not my thing necessarily, but I have Eastern European grandparents, and, you know,  they were into that. 
[01:53:00]  But the guy actually lives up there.  He doesn't basically leave his house, but he also has a smokehouse right there by the  Kedosha Hancock exit.  And you literally drive like a mile and a half through the backwoods on a dirt road to  get to this guy's house.  And on the side, he's got a cabin.  His name's Ray.  And by the way, like some of the best smoked salmon fish, they have like a smoked shrimp  there to die for.  Like, you go up there, like, we'll go get like a hot smoked salmon, and, you know, so  it's a little different than what your typical stuff.  And, I mean, we'll eat it on the boat the whole way down. 
[01:53:30]  It's freaking amazing.  It's like National Geographic did a special on this guy.  Like, he's a total character, totally unique.  Yeah, it sounds old school.  Yeah.  No, it's old school.  You pull up and you're like, da-da-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  You're hearing the deliverance, you know, banjo going.  I'm picturing, definitely.  But in the river, it's like going back in time.  He set up these traps, right?  Yeah, well, there's like a, you know, basically almost like a big rock funnel that he makes  in the river.  And, I mean, the thing's 200 yards.  Something you just couldn't do nowadays.  You just can't do that to a river. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, no, totally.  But he's allowed.  He's like grandfathered in.  Right.  Oh, wow.  So they funnel in, and he pretty much supplies eels to the entire world.  Yeah.  And it's right up there.  The eel guy.  I fucking hate eel.  I never even liked the sushi.  Eel sushi.  I don't mind that.  I'm not sure.  I'm not a big fan of smoked eel, I don't think.  But I've never really tried it, so I guess I've got to give it a shot.  Isn't that what the eel sushi is, though?  Like smoked?  It's cooked.  They have like that, you know, they do like the miso glaze, so it doesn't really taste  like fish.  It's a little mushy. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, if you're not into that texture.  But I like it a lot, so it's cool.  Yeah, I'm not into that.  And then Donald Trump Jr. was telling me he's going to have his fourth kid.  Was that for the air?  Oh, man.  Was that private shit?  I just realized.  Yeah, thanks.  We were going to keep it a secret, because it's really early in the pregnancy, and we're  superstitious, but you blew it.  Sometimes I don't know if you guys are telling us this stuff in private or not.  I don't know.  Yeah, listen, if I probably say it, it's open season.  I'm pretty much an open book, as you guys know, so it's all good.  Fourth kid, though.  Wow. 
[01:55:00]  Building the empire.  Yeah.  The empire.  Wow, that's a four.  That's a four.  Yeah.  We got girl, boy, boy, so we'll see if we can round it out with another girl.  I wouldn't mind.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're like...  Listen, I don't know.  I'm torn.  I mean, there's something cool about the boys with my hobbies, the hunting and the fishing  and the shooting and all that stuff.  To have a big herd of boys following you around has got to be pretty cool.  But, you know, my little girl is like, she's just so awesome.  Like, you know, she's got me totally wrapped around her fingers.  Oh, I bet she doesn't want another girl.  No, no, no. 
[01:55:30]  She'll be the princess.  She does now, but she doesn't realize that she won't in the future, I think.  She wants to be the only princess.  Daddy's attention, right.  And she's a tomboy anyway.  I mean, she's the first one out there that wants to go fishing with me and, you know,  wants to ride on the ATVs and do those kind of, you know, I try to make sure to give  them outside of New York City experiences so they don't grow up to be one of those kids.  Until Daddy turns into an asshole at a certain age.  Oh, no, I'm waiting for it.  Like, she is that way.  Like, she's, you know, I call her Baby Donald because she's my dad. 
[01:56:00]  I mean, she's tough.  There's no negotiating with her.  You know, she knows how to get what she wants.  When she figures out she's also beautiful, like, I'm dead.  I'm freaking screwed.  It's over for you.  There's times now where she does that stuff, and I'm like, you know, she's pulling stuff  that I see, you know, my friends with teenage daughters are pulling, and she's doing it  at, you know, she just turned five.  Like, I'm dead.  I'm dead.  You are done.  I'm dead.  She's the most aggressive little human being I know, but, you know, it's going to be bad.  Where does that come from?  Is it in the genes?  Is it in the Trump genes? 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, I think there's, you know, listen, there's obviously a genetic component.  I mean, she's been like that since she was born.  That's not like a learned behavior at four years old.  So, you know, she's just that way.  She knows how to get what she wants.  She doesn't care.  She's just, this is, you know, it's a very myopic focus.  Going with what Ann said, we've had your father on a few times.  Yours is very different than your father.  Yeah, listen, I know.  You're competitive like your father.  Correct.  I mean, listen, I think elements of that.  You're more down to earth.  You know what?  He's a down to earth guy.  He doesn't like showing that part.  But there's an image, and, you know, if you get him alone, you know, I say this, and I 
[01:57:00]  mean it in a respectful way, like, because, you know, these are the kind of guys I like  to hang out with, but he's a blue-collar guy with a huge balance sheet.  You know, he wants to sit at home and eat a burger, play golf.  No one knows more about, you know, pro sports than him.  You know, he's a true, like, American dude.  Like, he's just a guy.  But obviously, you know, he spent 30 years building up a brand.  A lot of that brand sells and caters to the really high end, and so he's got an image  stripper tech, but, like, you know, he can switch out of that really fast.  I mean, he's got, you know, the kind of wise-ass sense of humor that I have is totally him 
[01:57:30]  also.  I'm just perhaps a little more willing to turn that on, you know, outside of the family.  Yeah, yeah.  You can tell.  Yeah.  Clearly, I have no issue with that.  Right.  Which is good.  I like that.  That leads to Celebrity Apprentice.  Yeah.  You guys had a good year, man.  It's been a really good year.  Not a bad year.  Not a bad year at all.  Who's left?  I know Arsenio and Clay.  Correct.  And who else?  That's it?  Aubrey.  The final two?  Aubrey and Lisa, yeah, they were fired the last two weeks. 
[01:58:00]  So it's Arsenio and Clay in the finale.  So Arsenio Hall wins.  That's obvious.  You think so?  Really?  Yeah, it's so obvious.  He needs him more.  Why is that?  He needs him more.  That doesn't make a difference.  A little more desperate.  You think that goes through my father's mind, which one needs him more?  A little more desperate.  And Ashley needs a job, so he would actually work for the Trump Organization.  I know it's for charity, but he would expect an actual job, yeah.  But everybody, though, is saying Clay Aiken is like a real go-getter.  Clay's really good, man.  You know, honestly, like, and again, ironically, I don't watch much reality television, so I 
[01:58:30]  only know what I kind of heard of him, but I never really watched American Idol or these  things.  But, you know, he really impressed me.  I mean, he's got his shit together.  He's, you know, he's smart.  He's not just a singer.  I mean, he's a talented guy, no question, but, you know, he was really impressive on  the show.  Yeah.  What's wrong with Arsenio Hall?  Nothing.  What happened?  What happened?  He's a good guy.  I don't know what happened, though.  He was huge.  Yeah, that is kind of a...  He went from huge to nothing.  Usually those guys go huge, and then they kind of have something going on.  It's almost like the Dave Chappelle thing, where he's like, he just said, fuck it, I'm 
[01:59:00]  out.  Yeah, yeah, and left.  You know what I mean?  And left.  I still don't understand what happened to him.  Nor do I.  I have no idea.  I know the ratings went down or whatever, but you would think he would have still been  doing something all these years.  Yeah, well, listen, maybe this is the comeback, right?  I mean, The Apprentice has done that for people in the past.  I mean, a lot of guys have really revitalized their careers with it, so...  I wonder what happened, though, like in history, in that time.  When was it?  Late 90s?  Or when did he finally...  It was Clinton, right?  Early 90s, maybe, right? 
[01:59:30]  Oh, okay, right.  Yeah, because Clinton played the sax on his show.  It was 20 years ago.  Yeah, that he was really famous.  He was really famous for a while there.  A couple years.  So what happened in the 90s?  Like, you know how grunge killed, like, glam rock and all that crap?  Like, did anything come up that kind of put that type of thing in?  No, more late night shows.  Hard to work with?  No.  No, he's amazing.  Listen, now, I'm there watching them and I'm giving info to my father, so obviously, you 
[02:00:00]  know, they're probably not treating me like they may other people, but I actually, just  because it's my personality, I'm, you know, contrary to popular belief, a fairly down-to-earth  guy.  I spend a lot of time with the crew on the show, so I kind of, I pick their brain, like,  who's the diva behind the scenes, and who's the guy that's the real asshole, and I'm always  actually surprised, because some of the people that you think would be, you know, the most  high maintenance are not, and the ones that you think would not be are total pain in the  ass.  You know, to the guys that are just working on the show, getting them food, these kind  of things. 
[02:00:30]  And they're the ones that know best, yeah.  So that kind of gives me a good idea of who's real and who's just putting on the show for  me.  Who is the dumbest?  I like those types of guys.  Well, the list is long and not all that distinguished, so it's a...  I know that Teresa Broad is really dumb.  She is dumb.  I interviewed a bunch of the castmates, and they were all talking about Lou Ferrigno being  dumb.  Lou Ferrigno's dumb.  That's what they said.  He's deaf, though.  Maybe he's just deaf.  I think a lot of people have a hard time working with other people.  So, you know, listen, there's some go-getters, and they're aggressive alpha types, and there's 
[02:01:00]  other people that, you know, listen, well, you see it.  I mean, there's guys that can't function at that level.  It doesn't, you know, so when you're the project manager, and you're tasked to do this,  and you don't want to get your ass fired on national TV, and someone's basically there  not doing anything, can't really contribute, you know, that would drive me fucking crazy.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  But that's my personality.  Other people are ho-hum, yada, yada, yada, no big deal.  And, you know, so you have all those people in a room, and that's what makes it interesting.  I mean, that's why you see these fireworks, because people do get legitimately pissed  off, because it's their ass on the line in front of millions of people. 
[02:01:30]  I would draw attention to the fact that somebody sucked, and, you know, that gets them thrown  out.  Well, and they do.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That seems like a smart move, yeah.  You know, and I'm always amazed when some of the people that do suck don't call other  people out for their sucking.  You know, it's kind of amazing.  I've seen it toward the end of an episode where, you know, they're getting ready to throw somebody  off, and it's like, wow, this guy's taking a beating and not trying to defend themselves.  Oh, well, and I've called people out, and I'm like, what are you doing?  You told me X, Y, Z.  They're like, oh, yeah, X, Y, Z. 
[02:02:00]  I go, too fucking late.  No, it's too late.  You can't take my argument now and use it to your advantage.  Like, if you were sitting there for 20 minutes getting your ass beat, like, you know, hey,  it's a valid argument, but if you can't come up with that on your own, guess what?  You no longer belong here.  Right, yeah.  You know what I mean?  It's time for you to go.  Like, sorry.  Like, you shouldn't win this thing.  So why is Ferrigno dumb, Sam?  They said that he was absolutely the biggest pain in the ass, the most difficult to work  with, and that he didn't know what he was doing most of the time.  Wow.  He seemed to constantly...  Was he full of himself?  No, I don't think he was full of himself. 
[02:02:30]  You know, I thought Lou was a good guy, but, you know, he couldn't contribute from the creative  standpoint.  You know, in the boardroom, he'd sort of always turn on his team for a couple of times.  You know, so people just got pissed.  He stayed around for a long time because he was...  He maybe didn't do much, but he also didn't contribute to a loss.  He gave you good TV.  So he was around longer than people wanted him to, so it just sort of started getting  frustrating.  Annoying to people, yeah.  That's good TV.  It's great TV.  Did he just lift shit the whole time?  Well, I think that was the claim, which is basically that's what he's able to do. 
[02:03:00]  You know, so worker B is good, but, like, you know, you're not going to the final, you  know, final four with the worker B thing.  They said every task, he would try to figure out some way to be the Incredible Hulk on camera.  There is an element to that.  That's what I got.  I know it, and I'm going to use it.  That's awful, man.  Now, you got, like, of course, Clay Aik and Arsenio Hall.  Now, to have the two guys left over at the end, does that mean that these were the two  guys that were the most underhanded, the most, like, cunning, the most... 
[02:03:30]  No, not necessarily.  I mean, listen, sometimes people get far by staying under the radar.  Sometimes they get called out for that.  I mean, you know, it is a game of strategy.  You've got to figure out what's going on, what's happening at any given moment, right?  So, it just really depends.  I mean, you know, Arsenio won all the tasks, I think, that he was project manager on.  You know, that's kind of a natural.  So, you know, did he have some blow-ups?  Did he have some fights?  Yeah, but he also produced when he needed to.  You know, Clay was just a very solid performer.  People on his team liked him.  So, you know, he didn't get called back into the boardroom ever as being one of the guys  that was, hey, this is the reason we lost, even if he was on a losing team. 
[02:04:00]  So, he was on a team that won a lot of the time.  So, you know, it's sort of a natural fit, and now they're going to go head-to-head.  And it's Sunday at 9 on NBC.  It's going to be a good finale.  You're not going to be there, you were telling us.  I don't know yet.  You know, my problem is I'm giving a speech over in Europe.  I make a pretty decent kind of side living doing a lot of public speaking.  Apparently, people think I've got a good line of shit.  And so, I travel all over the world.  And so, I got a pretty cool gig.  I said, hey, you know, the finale, some of it's taped and then some of it's live. 
[02:04:30]  The live part, there's not an open mic, which is kind of what I'm better at anyway.  You know, when I can kind of interject, but because it's live, there'd be so many open mics,  you can't really edit it like you can, you know, when you film a boardroom and say,  okay, well, you heard my comment.  That'll override whatever someone was mumbling under the breath over there so they can do it.  So, you know, I get like one chance to ask like a question.  So, I was like, you know what?  For that, probably not that big a deal.  So, we'll see.  Take the Europe kick.  We're in Europe.  So, I'm going to be in Latvia.  Latvia.  Yeah, former Inriga over there, former Soviet Republic. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  I couldn't point to that on a map.  Yeah, I usually just say Russia because people can't do it.  Old Russia.  Yeah.  The new Russia.  And now they're like, hey, money.  Money, money, money.  Hey.  Capitalism.  Yeah.  We want this.  Yeah, a lot of people have done really well with it and others, not so much.  Not so good.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  What happened with that hunting debacle that you were being called out on?  Nothing.  I mean.  Well, TMZ posted pictures of one of your hunting trips.  Yes. 
[02:05:30]  Just for the people that don't know.  Yeah, and that was a big story for about two weeks.  But, you know.  No, they pushed it for a while.  Yeah, exactly.  It was, you know, actually sort of surprised me because, A, I didn't, you know, they're not  someone's, I don't know how they got the pictures, but, you know, what they tried  doing, and it's, you know, the PETA people, I'm sure you deal with this kind of crap  all the time.  You know, they start saying, well, it was a canned hunt behind a fence.  They were poaching.  All the meat was wasted.  I'm like.  What?  Like, no one knows any of these facts.  So I got, like, you know, obviously all the people from, you know, the game departments  over there writing letters saying, hey, it wasn't.  So, you know, obviously it's a much more interesting story when they say we're poaching. 
[02:06:00]  Like, I'm going to go to Africa to go poaching.  You're poaching.  I'm poaching.  You know, so they made this thing into something.  But, no, we're totally, you know, cleared.  But there was no investigation.  So they tried.  It was scandalous because, you know, listen, when you guys got an, when you have an agenda  to push, that's fine.  But don't lie to prove, to make an agenda because you have no facts.  That's fucking bullshit.  And that's what they were doing, yeah.  And you know what it was?  They wanted me, like, the king of Spain for doing the same thing.  They wanted me to come out and apologize.  It's like, well, I did nothing wrong.  Right.  I'm not apologizing. 
[02:06:30]  Like, I don't care.  And so I think I got more crap for that because they're like, now, I got crap from the people  who are against that stuff.  And I got serious props from the people who are for it, which is like, thank God someone  in your position finally has the balls to tell these guys to go fuck themselves.  I was on Twitter being like, okay, this is what it is.  You're being honest.  Yeah.  Listen, if you're going to push an agenda by lying, that's fine.  But when you get called out, obviously, once the truth came out, it was never heard from  again.  There's no story.  They went away.  But like, you know, listen, it's just not my personality to sit back and say, okay, I 
[02:07:00]  apologize because you want me to apologize for doing nothing wrong.  So, you know, de facto, I sort of became a spokesperson for the hunting sports.  I'm fine doing that because it's been good to me.  We're looking at a picture.  You killed an animal that has like the ponytail fucking horns.  What animal is that?  I can't know you.  Oh, that's a Cape Buffalo.  Really?  So, you know, that's Africa's most dangerous game.  I mean, that's, you know, very intense hunt.  And, you know, obviously, you're in the middle of nowhere.  I mean, we're in two million acres of wilderness.  It's not, you know, there's no fences. 
[02:07:30]  There's no, I mean, these guys tried making, you know, like we were shooting fish in a barrel.  Fish in a barrel, right.  So, you know, you're hunting those things.  They're very dangerous.  Some of the most, you know, they kill people every year over in Africa.  So, you know, they basically hunt bats, so it's a very intense type of thing.  You know, the other big thing, they said, well, the meat was wasted.  It's like, are you kidding?  There's villages there where literally, and I don't mean to say this as like an asshole sounding like a rich guy,  but if you have a shoe, not a pair, but a shoe, it's considered a luxury.  Yeah.  You know, so these guys are thrilled for the meat.  They're not allowed to hunt over there because the problem is over there hunting is a big business. 
[02:08:00]  Okay.  Guys like me coming over and spending money to go do it.  A lot of money.  Preserve that land.  The problem is if there's no hunting, there's no economic value to those animals.  Guess what?  People come in.  They overgraze these areas of wilderness with cows.  In two years, an area that's a lush place becomes barren desert.  So, I mean, you know, if you look at any of the statistics, even like guys like National Geographic  and even some of the big, you know, kind of pro-animal rights places say, listen, the hunting does add value  because, you know, the environmentalists that bitch about hunting, the one that, you know, they bitch, 
[02:08:30]  but the problem is they don't contribute any money.  Right.  You know, there's no economic value and there's not much value to the photo tourism and these kind of things.  So, what happens to a local if they kill something?  It's bad.  No, like when we go, and that's why it was such nonsense when they were poaching.  We're literally there with two guys with AK-47s that are there like watching for poachers,  making sure everything's done legally, you know, from the parks department.  If, you know, listen, if they catch poachers over there, they get shot.  There's not like a trial.  There's not, they start shooting at them.  It's really bad. 
[02:09:00]  So, you know, these guys, you know, their typical meal consists of mealy pop, which is basically, you know,  their version of like grits.  Right.  You know, that's all they eat.  So, when something happens like this, when, you know, if you get an elephant down, you come back two hours later,  there's nothing left.  I mean, literally every ounce of meat is used.  You know, and people are like, well, it's a rich area of Zimbabwe, which is an oxymoron.  I mean, that was one of the other things.  There's no way the meat would be used.  It's like, you know what?  I'd show you pictures, except it's too gruesome when, you know, they show up with hacksaws and axes.  And just start chopping meat off. 
[02:09:30]  And they're grateful for it.  I mean, it's really.  It's a hell of a way to get your steak.  It's really amazing.  Chop a piece off and put it in a bucket.  Now, I have no problem with what you did.  But from a human standpoint, I would never be able to shoot an animal like that.  Listen, to each his own.  Fish is easy.  Does anything go through you?  Listen, you know, obviously, I think when you first start, there's the horn if you miss it.  Listen, you know, it's something I grew up doing.  It's something that sort of, you know, I feel, you know, part of certainly an American heritage. 
[02:10:00]  I think, you know, people try to attack it.  And you know what it is?  People who've never done it, they don't know.  And so they assume it's a lot.  I've taken a lot of my friends that are, you know, kind of rich New York City guys.  I'll take them up to, you know, a club I belong to in upstate.  And we'll go do like a bird hunt.  We'll go shoot some ski.  You get them caught up on the safety.  I can kill birds all day long.  Well, but they do it and they're like, I could never do that.  Then they get out in the field, they do it and they're, I mean, I've converted more guys  than a hunter just saying, hey, this is awesome.  You know, deer hunting, same thing.  I mean, there's the reason you're able to do what you're able to do in Westchester, even 
[02:10:30]  in some of these areas close, because they're incredibly overpopulate.  I mean, there's more deer in the U.S. today by like a hundred times than there was a hundred  years ago.  Really?  Well, because people have yards.  There's no more, you know, in the forest, there's not as much food.  So the browse is gone.  There's not, when you have yards and grass and everything like that, there's a lot more  natural food than there would have been before.  So, you know, the population is just not kept in as much check.  So you have a rough winter, you know, not like this year, but a couple of years ago.  And that's why, you know, you're driving down the Jersey Turnpike, you see a dead deer  every five feet because they're running into the median to try to feed because that's the 
[02:11:00]  only place where there's any grass left.  You know, it serves a purpose.  You know, people don't want to believe that.  They don't want to understand the science behind it because, you know, it's not something  they're accustomed to.  But once you get used to it, you know, it is what it is.  And, you know, I love it.  And for me, listen, I grew up, you know, very well-to-do family in New York City.  You know, I have a lot of friends in similar situations.  You know what?  When I was out fishing and hunting and waking up early in the tree stand, they were doing  drugs, doing these kind of things.  Like, you know, by the way, not that I was an angel by any, you know, by any means growing 
[02:11:30]  up, but, like, the outdoors kept me out of a lot of other trouble.  I mean, I could only hope the same for, you know, a lot of other kids.  So, you know, I always encourage people to, you know, get your kids outdoors, do those  kind of things with them.  You know, it's really important.  It really has been good to me, which is why I have no problem, even if it's controversial,  saying, screw you, this is my stance, I'm sticking by it, because, you know, it's  probably kept me out of a lot of other trouble.  With that, what year did you get your shit together?  Because you did have your issues going on.  Listen, I'd say I quit, you know, basically drinking at about 24, 25, you know, where 
[02:12:00]  I was, you know, partying hard, you know, in New York is kind of, you know, everyone  I knew from college, I all worked here because they're all business school guys, you know.  I moved to Colorado after school to work at a bar for a year and a half, and, you know,  Did that drive your dad nuts?  I'm sure he wasn't thrilled, but, you know, again, there was an interview the other night  where, you know, they did, like, a stump to Trump thing, and he was, like, you know,  asking quite, the reporter was asking him questions about the kids.  You know, I was the troublemaker, I was the one that broke curfew, but, you know, but  I also have, you know, good willpower, so I, you know, I can't do both things. 
[02:12:30]  I've been really lucky with what I've been given in life, and so I wasn't going to blow  it because I wanted to party too hard.  That was stupid, so.  Yeah, but what turned it around for you?  You just finally realized this was a waste of time?  Yeah, after a couple, you know, you just say, dude, what the hell was I doing?  Exactly.  A couple bad weekends, and you wake up.  Bathroom tile floor pattern on your cheek.  Maybe once or twice.  No comment.  Yeah, and I'm not going to comment on that, because, you know, now you're bringing up,  people bringing up high school stuff that people did about the presidency.  Right, right.  You know, if that stuff's on limits, I'm not going on the record on any of that shit. 
[02:13:00]  Can you believe that?  It's such nonsense.  I mean, think about how stupid that is.  It just shows, like, your grasp.  If you have to go back to someone, someone maybe once bullied someone in high school.  It's like, really, guys?  Like, that's what you got?  Yeah, yeah.  That's what you got?  That's scary to me.  And not even taking it in the context of the time itself, where I don't think there was  one person in that school that wouldn't have bullied or been an asshole.  It just, that's kind of the way it was.  We've kind of learned a little more.  Today, it's like an epidemic.  You know, they've turned it into a big, and by the way, it is a problem, and there's times, 
[02:13:30]  you know, and listen, it happens.  It shouldn't.  But back then, there wasn't, like, an awareness campaign.  No, no.  And by the way, the quote-unquote victim, you know, they came out and said, it's nonsense.  It's not what happened at all.  Like, you know, so, you know, for Obama to be saying this about, I mean, it's pretty pathetic.  Like, if we were all guilty of the shit that we did in high school, even college, if that  could come back to, like, no one, no one would be able to be an elected official.  No one would be able to hold a position at any office. 
[02:14:00]  No one, I mean, you couldn't function in the world.  That was your time to be an asshole.  Like, you had to.  And by the way, and to get screwed, I mean, listen, when I went to boarding school in  eighth grade, and I'm a smartass, you don't think I got my ass kicked by, like, the seniors  that were five years older than me and the one that kicked the shit out of a rich kid?  Like, you know, and I took it, and I dealt with it, and it is what it is, but, you know,  for you to call it out, you know, in a presidential, I mean, if I'm another country, I'm, like,  planning the invasion, being like, we've become this pathetic, like, you know, that's 
[02:14:30]  presidential politics now, it's fucking stupid.  It really is sad when I saw that.  I was like, what do you think of the election?  What do you think it's going to, uh...  Listen, you know, honestly, I'm glad it's looking closer than I thought it was going to be.  Listen, it's hard to beat an incumbent, especially an incumbent that basically is promising everyone  everything like last time.  It's, you know, because, listen, there's a demographic in the country, it's like, well,  I'm going to tax the rich, and even though, you know, if you do the math, and you look  at there's a couple things online, you do the math, like, if you took everything above  $250,000 made by anyone making more than $250,000, everything, it covers, like, less than three 
[02:15:00]  months of an annual budget.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, so where's the rest come from?  Yeah.  And if you took all of their aggregated wealth, you know, above $250,000, so everyone in the  country that was worth more than $250,000, including all of their homes, and basically  said, now you're only worth $250,000, we took it all, it doesn't even cover one year.  The problem is, there's nothing left, so where do you go, where do you go at that point  for more, for more funds?  And so, when you look at these things, but it's easy to say, hey, I'm in the 48% that 
[02:15:30]  pays no federal income tax.  Yeah, sure, I want all of those other things, I want, you know, no one wants to deal with  the concept of austerity or responsibility, so it's like, yeah, tax them, that's perfect,  but they, you know, it sounds horrible to say this, and, you know, I'll get shit on for  saying it, because I'm the son of a rich guy, and what the fuck do I know, and, you know,  I didn't go to war, and I didn't, you know, but, like, you know, I was born with  a silver spoon, so it's, because, you know, there's always an excuse for someone who preaches  the other side of that story, but, you know, it doesn't work, so I get a hard time for that,  and I get that.  But you work hard. 
[02:16:00]  I work hard, but no one wants to believe that, so it doesn't matter, you know what I mean?  You don't get credit for that in this world anymore.  No, you don't.  Because it's not convenient to someone else's agenda.  But there were a lot of guys that were born with a silver spoon, and they decide not to  work or do anything with their lives.  Correct, but again, it's self-serving for me to say otherwise, and, you know, then you get called  out for being a hypocrite, so it's not worth making the argument.  Sometimes, but it's ridiculous.  So 48% pays nothing.  I don't think they should be able to complain at all about it.  With New York State, City, and Federal, I pay 51% of my taxes.  Right.  I'm not carrying my weight.  You're not doing it more.  I'm not doing it more. 
[02:16:30]  Really?  I hear you.  Believe me.  And to have 49% of the country not pay anything, and then still bitch at you that you're not  doing enough?  Yeah.  It's ludicrous.  And you look at where it's going, and the trends, and the people that are on it.  You know, we're basically saying, you know, for a lot of people, it's cheaper to not,  they're making a better living not working.  And I mean, I have friends with businesses that, they're like, literally, I have a harder  time getting employees, now that the economy's coming back, the guys that used to work for  me that I had to let go because I didn't have any choice, they don't want to work because  they're doing side jobs for cash, okay? 
[02:17:00]  They'll work two days a week for cash, and they're collecting, you know, welfare and all  these things and everything, other program that they can do.  They're making more money working one day a week than they were, you know, and contributing  back.  The entitlements.  Working five days a week.  It's amazing.  It's such a disincentive system, it's crazy.  It is, yes.  I've got a bigger question for you.  How do we turn around this country?  Listen, I think you've just got to get someone in there.  No matter who's in there.  By the way, it's not going to be easy, you know, no matter who.  For whoever.  Because, you know, our politicians, they get elected based on, you know, appealing to the  majority.  The majority, you know, is unfortunately not like the, you know, the majority 50 years ago 
[02:17:30]  where people say, hey, I really want to work.  I want to try to make the American dream for myself.  Now they just want it to fall in their lap.  I mean, we had a president that won an election on a campaign of hope, and I think, when you  really think about that, like, oh, yeah, you know what hope means to be like, I'm going  to sit back and do nothing.  And just hope.  And like, I hope this shit really works out.  You know what?  We never broke down that word.  You're right.  How ridiculous is that word hope?  I don't know if I've ever said it before, like publicly, but like that, like that keeps 
[02:18:00]  me up at night.  I'm like, you know, when my grandfather, you know, who worked his ass off, I mean, his parents  were immigrants, he came, you know, he was born like four years after they moved here  from Germany.  Right.  You know, he, his father died when he was like nine or 10.  He became the man of the house at nine or 10.  Like, he had to get out of school to go work because that's how you supported the family.  Right.  At nine or 10 years old.  So he started working on a job site.  He learned how to build.  He learned to trade.  He started doing it for other people.  You know, he made, you know, it was a Horatio Alger type story.  I mean, he, he did the American dream.  He built, you know, but like, you don't see that anymore. 
[02:18:30]  Everyone's just like, I want to win the lottery.  Let's just hope.  Yeah.  We never broke down the word.  That's great.  The word is kind of silly.  It's embarrassing, right?  I mean, you know, if you're thinking about it.  I can understand change.  Yeah, change.  The word change, but the word hope.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's true.  I used to hate hoping.  Yeah.  You know, hoping's not.  I used to hate it.  Because it shouldn't be in your vocabulary.  Because usually nothing's going to happen.  Nothing panned out.  You got to kind of work at it.  Wow.  That's funny.  That's so weird. 
[02:19:00]  That's an obvious one.  How's mama doing?  She's doing well.  Yeah.  We never talk about your mom.  It's always about your father.  Hey, she's around the world, traveling.  She's, you know, she just has a good time.  She's just chilling.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She does a bunch of little business things and everything like that.  But she's, you know, just busy doing all of that.  And so she gets to lead a pretty cool life.  Nice.  Yeah.  God, it must be nice, huh?  No kidding.  You know, winging over to Europe to do a speech.  Yeah.  Hey, you come back.  You want to know what my schedule is in the next week? 
[02:19:30]  It's not so great.  You know, tomorrow I go to Latvia.  I've got to give a speech over the weekend.  I'm back Sunday.  I have to do something.  I have to be here on Monday.  Monday night, I take the red eye.  I have to go to Israel for a deal that I'm working on.  There for one day.  From there, I've got to go to London and Scotland.  Then I'm back here for a day.  And then I may have to go back to the Middle East the following week.  So it's not so easy.  And I'm not flying on my dad's plane.  It's not like this is like...  You said that last time.  Yeah, this is not like...  You fly coach, right?  For the most part.  Usually, yeah.  I mean, some of the international trips, when it's crazy, I will go to business. 
[02:20:00]  But for the most part...  You know what?  What motivates you?  Within the U.S., it's like, I can't fly business.  I feel like a moron paying six times as much for a ticket.  I'm going to be sitting there for four hours.  I'll read a book or I'll be on my iPad.  First class is nice.  I'd rather donate it to charity.  First class is nice.  It is really nice.  Yeah, well, look, the problem I have, and it sounds so obnoxious, but it's when I travel  with my dad, I'm on his plane.  So it makes anything, at that point, it makes anything suck.  Like, if you're sitting there in first class, you're like, this blows.  Comparison, yeah.  What's on his plane? 
[02:20:30]  Had I never been on my dad's plane, it's like, oh, coach would be awesome.  But it's that much more painful once you've flown private on the 757, dude.  What's on his plane?  Just everything you can imagine?  It's a living room.  You know, you've got two bedrooms, you've got pretty amazing AV displays set up, couches.  It's pretty cool.  Yeah.  Just one time.  I love the fact that the world is his office.  Yeah.  It's like, ah, you know, you're making deals where the world's involved.  Right.  That's pretty goddamn cool. 
[02:21:00]  But what does motivate you?  Because you don't have to work that hard where you're flying all over the place.  Well, you know, that's not exactly true.  You know, again, like I said, we weren't brought up like trust fund kids, and I think that  was probably the best thing our parents could have done for us.  Meaning, you know, we were always kind of kept...  When I was in college, and it wasn't that long ago, you know, I got 300 bucks a month  on a credit card, which is nice, but anything else I had to work for in the summer.  That was it?  Yeah.  You know, so I was, you know, I was the guy bumming beer money in college, so...  But your fellow students must have hated you.  Well, especially, you know, some of the places I went to school where it's like, give me a  break.  But they probably looked at you like, you're paying for the cake party, obviously. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, but you know what?  I think it was a good lesson, because it made you hungry, it made you recognize the  value of the dollar.  You know, I have Eastern European grandparents, and, you know, I used to spend a month to six  weeks with my grandfather in the Czech Republic back in the 80s, every summer.  You know, I spoke the language fluently, had friends over there.  So I learned at a young age that the shit that I got in the U.S. and with my family, you  know, I realized that that is not the norm.  Right.  And that's why, you know, that's why I'm able to say, hey, caveat the stuff, like when  I'm talking about, listen, I recognize where it's coming from, and I know, but I've also  experienced the other side, and I've seen people that, you know, that's truly different 
[02:22:00]  than America.  You know, communist Czechoslovakia was a very different element, but it was good for me  at a young age to really recognize, you know, the value of a dollar, you know, understanding  that, understanding how lucky we are.  And that's why I'm able to, you know, do a lot of the stuff I do with charity and to give  back, because, hey, man, I've been pretty freaking fortunate, and I recognize that.  It's not lost on me.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah, that must have been quite the change.  Yeah.  Back then, and then you come back here, and it's like, ah, everything's in color, like  the Wizard of Oz.  Yeah.  It was in color there. 
[02:22:30]  It was just the buildings were much gloomier.  A little gloomy, yeah.  Wow.  What do you think of Ground Zero and World Trade?  Listen, I think the building's looking good.  Glad it's, you know, finally coming to a front.  I mean, it's a little ridiculous that it took 11 years to get to this point, but I'm not  going to comment on that.  Like, I'm just glad it's...  You should.  It says a lot.  It's frustrating.  Oh, it's embarrassing.  I mean, listen, if my father was in charge of that thing, it would have never happened that  way.  You know what I mean?  It had been built five years ago, six years ago, and...  Don't you think for the 10th anniversary, it was kind of embarrassing?  Like, well, here's the building almost done. 
[02:23:00]  Here's a hole.  Like, you don't think at the very least for the 10-year anniversary, it would have been...  You know, you have so many government...  I mean, that's the problem.  Red tape and all sorts of shit.  No one can get along.  50% of the people are on either side of a spectrum.  I mean, you can't...  It's going to be difficult for our country to do anything in the future because we're  so polarized.  You know, you really have two countries within one.  And it's such a close margin, and it slides back and forth by a fraction of a percent every  year.  And it's...  I don't know how to get anything done.  I mean...  Well, Jimmy talks about having a strong third party. 
[02:23:30]  You think that would work?  Yes.  You know, listen, I think there's nothing worse than bipartisan politics because of  these things.  Like, I find it hard to believe...  Now, listen, I'm a pretty conservative guy.  But you know what?  Gay marriage.  I have no issue with what someone does in their own...  I don't care.  I don't even understand why it's an issue.  Why is it an issue?  Right.  The abortion thing.  I know this is one that's going to piss a lot of people off because it...  But, like, I find it hard to believe that if I'm a conservative, I can't not  be, you know, against those issues and expect to get elected in any primary.  Now, in an actual election, hey, you could do actually pretty well if you were somewhere 
[02:24:00]  that split the baby with some of these issues socially and fiscally.  But it's so stupid to me that you really believe that all 400 and something members  of Congress and all 100 senators, they all really believe 100% of these issues on this  side.  No.  And 100 on the...  Yeah, yeah.  Give me a break.  But they have to appear that way for whatever reason.  Yeah, they're all selling out to cater to...  Being dishonest, yeah.  Don't lie to us.  There's no way...  Listen, I believe that there are some that are crazy and probably do believe 100% in all 
[02:24:30]  of these things, but there's no way that that...  And it's pathetic that that's the case.  The problem with a third party is it will always lean a little bit more one way than  the other.  And so all you're doing, you know, like you've seen it with the Ross Perot...  Taken away.  You're just basically taking away from one or the other.  Well, that is true.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you're really just screwing up one side.  Like, you end up with one big party and two minority parties.  It's like, it doesn't work because, you know, we're so entrenched.  Like, to do this, you'd almost have to start over.  Yeah.  And that's never going to happen. 
[02:25:00]  I don't really mind...  I'd rather it be different, but like you said, the two-party system, it's kind of hard  to get away from because of that.  Right.  But I would like it to be based a little less on money, the fact that all these guys  running need multi-millions of dollars to even have any shot at all.  How do you spend a billion dollars?  Like, can't you say, hey, fine, take a hundred million dollars, the two final contenders,  this is what you got.  Yeah.  Run with it.  By the way, it's a good business model. 
[02:25:30]  Right.  Because prove to me that you can make this work.  You know, anyone can spend unlimited funds.  Right.  I can do that.  Perfect.  You both have the same amount.  Make it work.  I mean, that's what the country needs, right?  Yeah, yeah.  The country needs someone that can say, hey, this is the revenue we make.  This is how much we spend.  It happens to be a lot more than the revenue we make.  Well, prove to me that you can run a business and you can do it efficiently.  Their campaign is sort of the precursor to what they do once they're in.  I can spend more than you.  Spend unlimited amounts of money and just get into debt. 
[02:26:00]  You're right.  Here's a set amount of money.  Let's see who does a better job of spending it.  And do the same in the primaries with a lower number.  And by the way, institute term limits.  And if you have stalemates, force politicians to not be able to take office.  If they can't pass things that, you know, on an equitable basis.  They're never going to vote for that.  But you know what?  We're citizens.  If we start pushing for these kind of things, someone eventually will have the balls to do it, put it forth.  And then I'd love to see the other people vote against it.  Yeah.  If they don't vote against it, then they won't get reelected. 
[02:26:30]  I mean, you can make it happen.  I'm not saying it's easy.  Don't kid yourself.  I'm not naive.  The civilians don't have that type of power anymore.  Probably not.  You know, but, you know, I think someone should try.  What's the boiling point for the country, you think?  And what happens then?  Aren't we kind of there?  I don't know.  I'm still on it.  We're in a point where, I mean, you know, both – I've never seen this kind of animosity on both sides of the spectrum.  You could be liberal and Democrat.  You could be Republican.  And you know what?  After the day is done, you still got together.  But, I mean, these people now, they fundamentally hate each other, which, by the way, is difficult to do business that way. 
[02:27:00]  I mean, when I'm doing business and deals, I'm able to do that because, you know, even though we're on opposite sides of the table, the guy still likes me.  I still like him.  I know where he needs to be.  He knows where I need to be.  Hey, and we'll come up with a way to do business.  I mean, it's sort of sad that you look at countries like China and these places where – hey, they've got three or four guys that actually know what they're talking about at the top that say this is where we want to be in 20 years.  And that's how they – you know, we don't care about the other stuff.  And we can't do that because we have to promise someone something next week because every two weeks there's another election. 
[02:27:30]  You know, it's just a model of inefficiency.  You can't do it because you've got to keep putting, you know, five cents in someone's pocket tomorrow at the expense of their grandchildren's well-being in the future.  And then we're just racking up debt.  I mean, think about the debt.  We've had on more debt in the last three years than we have ever – it's crazy.  Yeah.  And there's no end.  And there is no end.  There really doesn't seem to be a solution around the corner.  Look at Europe. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, man.  I mean, France kills Greece trying to push austerity measures.  Then they elect the president that says, well, you know what?  That shit's great, but we don't want it for ourselves.  It's like, of course you don't.  But if you can't afford to do it for yourself, how can you – like, how can people vote for that?  Like, it's almost – you know, listen, I get democracy, but, like, there's a point where you've got to say enough.  It's like – so it's do as I say, not as I do.  It's just – you know, politics has just become so hypocritical.  It's like, you know, I'm going to push this shit on others, but I'm not going to do it myself.  Just like Congress.  Hey, we really want Obamacare, but we're not going to take that shit for ourselves.  But we're not taking it. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, we got our own – we got our own good shit.  You think there will be a revolution in this country?  I mean, you say we're at this boiling point, but then what does that mean to the average person?  I don't know.  I mean, I don't think there's that many people that are – you know, they're – I don't know that they're militant, but, you know, it's just –  Well, what happens?  We all just go broke?  Listen, I think – listen, it's very demoralizing.  I think a lot of people will continue to not try to work – you're losing a lot of spirit.  You're losing a lot of what made America great, which is, you know, that willingness to take a chance, to go out there and risk something and get off your ass and go make it happen.  You know, the people that came over to this country on boats with nothing to hope – you know, that's what made this country great. 
[02:29:00]  I mean, that's why we were a superpower.  It wasn't because people, you know, were here for many years and they just kind of sat there and, you know, pretended that everything was great.  You know, it doesn't work that way.  We've got to make shit.  We're getting away from that.  We've got to start making shit again.  We're just going to – I think it's going to be kind of a Roman Empire thing where it just kind of just fades, crumbles.  Yeah, listen, just look at Europe.  It'll be the same thing.  I mean, we're just following much closer.  You know, they fell off years ago.  We're just – you know, we're following their path.  Instead of being 50 years behind them, we'll be a couple years behind them. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  It's a shame we can't figure it out.  Yeah.  It really is a shame.  Yeah, I don't know.  There's a sense of entitlement.  Now that I want to go shoot myself, it was great being a show, Kat.  I appreciate it.  There's just a sense of entitlement now that is ruining the country.  Yeah.  It really is.  You were tweeting last week, like, fuck that.  I ain't coming in.  If I get whooping cough, I'm going to be pissed I'm never coming on the show again, for the record.  Your Twitter was funny last week.  And then I have to tell you, I've got something going on way down low here.  I don't know what the hell.  Yeah, that's great.  He wouldn't shake my hand, but he still gave me the fist bump. 
[02:30:00]  I'm like, a little wave couldn't do it.  It doesn't matter, yeah.  Yeah, a little wave couldn't do it.  Infected.  I'm going to be on a plane going over to Latvia, and it's going to be one of those dumb and dumber moments.  That's sort of what I've got going on.  Yeah, that's great.  That's sort of what I've got.  Well, we've got to take a break.  Celebrity Apprentice finale Sunday at 9, man.  I don't know if you want to be here for the Penthouse Girls.  The great Donald Trump.  That might be good for you.  It's going to be bad for my marriage.  I'm sure my wife would not appreciate that at all.  It's all that shit.  It's up to you, though.  The great Donald Trump.  Yeah, we're going to have Penthouse Girls in a few minutes. 
[02:30:30]  This is a tough call for me here.  No kidding.  Because if I leave with your audience, I'm a pussy.  If I stay, I've got to do it with it.  So it's a tough call.  I may have to say hi and then leave.  That way I get kind of partial credit both ways.  Well, we'll see what you decide, I guess, after the break.  We'll see.  If you're not here, Donald J. Trump Jr. on Twitter.  I like giving out the Twitter there.  Appreciate it.  And Celebrity Apprentice finale, Sunday at 9 on NBC.  You're good to follow on Twitter because you're way more honest than maybe you should be.  You know what?  I get a lot of shit for it.  I see sort of the boost in followers and then almost an equal drop-off. 
[02:31:00]  Drop-off, yeah.  I'm sort of getting to a better place with people that actually like me.  But yeah, I piss off as many people as I attract.  Isn't that hilarious?  You'll throw a tweet out there that you think is like, who gives a fuck?  And you go, wow, people are mad at that?  And you lose hundreds of followers on one dumb tweet?  Yeah, I said, oh my God, once.  And I had like 40 people reply back, took the Lord's name in vain, unfollow.  Wow.  Really?  By the way.  I was just saying, oh my God.  And that's a statement for the country in and of itself. 
[02:31:30]  If you can't handle that on Twitter, how do you function in the real world?  How do you leave your house in the morning?  If that's something that's under your skin, I mean.  Just to be offended every day.  But that's where we've gone.  It's exhausting.  It's so tiring to be PC.  I mean, if you took away just that inefficiency alone, maybe we could come back.  It's like what you were saying before with the apology.  There seems to be this knee-jerk reaction that everyone has to apologize the second something's 
[02:32:00]  perceived as offensive.  And then if you explain yourself and leave it alone, it goes away.  Why do people feel compelled to just...  It goes either way, either way.  But when you go down as being a police in a cellar.  Because if you apologize, by definition, you did something wrong.  Exactly.  If I, you know, they, listen, the king of Spain with the hunting thing, he did the same  thing as me.  Yeah.  Two minutes later.  Well, I apologize.  Like, you're the king of Spain.  What?  You did nothing wrong.  What the fuck are you apologizing for?  Like, you're, and I, like, me?  Like, I'm the one telling people to go screw themselves.  Like, you know, prove to me that I did something wrong.  Yeah.  I have the evidence otherwise.  Like, you can make up lies. 
[02:32:30]  Like, are you kidding me?  Like, but that's where we've become as a world.  And, like, other countries, the developing nations, the emerging markets, you know, where  they don't deal with this crap, they're sitting there laughing.  Laughing.  It's like, it's so stupid.  I demand an apology.  Do you really?  Really?  What are you, in third grade?  Do you think it's going to be sincere if you're demanding it, first of all?  Oh, yeah.  I really, I'm really sorry.  That's something I do all the time is, you know, I'm apologizing for it now.  I'm going to stop because you want me to.  Like, what are you, an idiot?  Like, have you ever won an argument with your dad? 
[02:33:00]  You know?  And if so, what was it about?  The problem with arguments, you know, is it relates to, it's tough.  And it's obviously, a lot of it relates to business.  So you go one way or the other, so there's no way to say the other way would have been  better or worse.  Right, because it didn't happen.  So I've made a couple, you know, a big bet with us is more for ego than, you know, we'll  bet a dollar on something.  So, you know, my prized possession is like my signed dollar from my dad for a bet that I  won, because I said we'd do X or better than X, and he said there's no way that's going 
[02:33:30]  to happen, you know.  So, but yeah, no, he's not an easy person to win an argument with.  They're living trading places.  Mortimer.  Mortimer.  How much did they bet?  Wasn't it a dollar?  It was a dollar.  It was, right?  It was a dollar.  I love that stupid movie.  It's not so much the dollar as it is the signature.  You know, it's the, boom, I have it up on my thing, like, I won.  Nice.  It's just the victory.  It's the little things.  All right, we're going to break.  Donald Trump Jr., always a pleasure.  Oh, man.  Good to be here.  Hell yeah.  Celebrity apprentice.  You're good, right?  When I'm on a, I usually don't end up promoting that much. 
[02:34:00]  I just kind of go off on a 20-minute rant, so.  I like those.  Celebrity apprentice finale Sunday at 9 p.m. NBC.  Yep.  Very cool.  Look forward to Clay Aiken and Arsenio Hall.  Yeah.  Hall wins it.  Who will it be?  You think Hall?  Yeah, no doubt.  Wow, really?  Underdog shit.  You think he's the underdog?  Coming to play?  Yeah, because he came out of nowhere.  We forgot about Arsenio Hall.  Clay Aiken's been around.  But he started at a higher base.  I mean, he had his own late night show.  Like, you know, I don't know that it's so easy. 
[02:34:30]  I don't know that it's so easy.  It's Hall.  It's Hall.  We should get him in here.  I like the confidence.  We didn't get any of the guys this year.  Really?  We got Andretti.  You didn't ask for him.  Yeah, last time I was here was with Andretti.  Why can't we have him?  Why do we have to ask?  Well, you had Penn.  Oh, yeah.  Penn we love.  Yeah.  And you could have.  I mean, I had most of them.  You couldn't have any of them.  I had most of them.  Yeah.  Yeah, so basically you had no follow-through.  Were they offered?  Yeah.  Like who?  Well, you turned down Aubrey for yesterday. 
[02:35:00]  Oh, yeah.  We were present yesterday.  Who else did you say?  Listen, I'm happy to come on more often.  You know, as far as I'm concerned, I'm all you need.  You're the only one we need.  I don't know about your listeners, but as far as I'm concerned, you know.  Lou Ferrigno, Paul Tuttle, Senior.  No, we would have taken Lou.  You would have taken Paul, I would think.  And we've had Paul on, so what are you talking about, Sam?  We would have taken those guys.  We had Debbie Gibson.  We tried for Lisa Lampanelli.  She won't do our show.  Right, that was the one.  And Debbie Gibson we had. 
[02:35:30]  She sort of flirted with us.  Her and Tiffany.  Dee Snider you turned down.  Yeah, Dee.  I guess I'm not supposed to laugh, but it's kind of funny.  Yeah, he's a good guy, but.  We don't hate him.  I would like to have George Takei.  He's a Howard guy.  He's pretty funny, but yeah, that may be, I mean, I guess that was the issue with Lisa,  right, is that she's kind of big stuff, yeah.  But that's not our issue.  The two camps.  That's never been our issue.  But is it his issue, I guess?  Yeah, absolutely, but people will deny that all the time. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, it gets a little.  But it's absolutely the issue they have over there.  They have cock-blocked us from a lot of people over the years.  Cock-blocked.  They really have.  We all know it.  Yeah.  It happens.  They'll deny, deny, deny, but Lisa Lampanelli basically let us in on that a little bit.  And then she denied that there's actually anything going on.  We like Lisa.  We all have the same friends.  I don't have an issue with her.  Yeah.  We know all the same fucking people.  She'd be perfect for the show.  She was on.  Yeah.  We're Twitter pals.  Are you Twitter pals?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:36:30]  I'm very happy for you, Sam.  I got a Jay Moore update on Bob.  Oh, okay.  See, he wrote.  All right.  After the break?  Yeah, after the break.  Cool.  Thank you, sir.  No problem, guys.  Fly fishing, maybe.  We'll see.  Yeah, shoot me an email next week.  All right.  Donald Trump Jr., everyone.  Sirius XM.  XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:37:00]  Well, does she allow us to sit on your face?  Yeah, we'll find out.  Squat on that face.  Justine Jolie, Nicky Benz, and Heather Vandevin.  Vandevin?  Yeah.  Vandevin.  I got that right.  They're going to be promoting Saints Row the Third, out now for Xbox and PS3. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, yeah.  I want to thank Donald Trump Jr. for stopping in.  I felt like I was interrupting him the whole time, but you got to try to get in there.  You got to try to get in there.  He's got a lot of stories.  Stories and energy.  A lot of energy, that guy.  Stories.  Very interesting to listen to, though.  He's got those stories, like you said.  And I think I got a real invite, Ant.  I wouldn't.  I think that was a real invite.  He even said after the interview, he was like, give me an email next week. 
[02:38:00]  That was fucked.  Like, you were the one that brought it up, though.  No, I was.  Because I thought if he was like, no, I asked him if he wanted to go.  You're like, oh, no, you brought it up.  He felt like he was in a tough position.  I didn't really bring it up.  I was just talking about fly fishing in general.  Because, you know, a mutual friend was tweeting pictures of what's called pigs in the fly fishing world.  They were catching pigs up there in Roscoe.  Sam, that was a real invite. 
[02:38:30]  You know that.  It was close.  Knowing you, you'll talk about it for an hour on the fucking aftershock.  Oh, my God.  Get everyone's opinion.  But then I'll get some good stuff, won't I?  I guess.  But I think I got a real invite.  It was close to a real invite.  What sucks is like.  I mean, it wasn't a real invite because he said you have to email him.  If it was a real invite, it would be there.  You know what I mean?  Or he would email you.  Yeah, because now it's going to be kind of weird for me to go.  Oh, remember what?  Exactly.  You know what?  You're right.  And he knows that.  He knows how to play the game.  Because I play that same game.  I would email him. 
[02:39:00]  Email me.  I would turn it into a real invite.  Make it awkward.  Really?  If I were you, I'd go fly fishing with him.  When you get that whole email me thing.  Right.  I just want a rich friend.  But it sounds like a guy like that, you're paying your way.  Why don't you just start with a friend?  I got friends.  I really got friends.  I got lots of friends.  Oh, my God.  Is Eric your friend?  Not really.  Are you my friend, E-Rock?  I guess E-Rock's my friend.  Sit down, E-Rock. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, you want the Jay Moore thing?  Am I allowed to read this, E-Rock?  Yeah, what's going on?  He didn't say not to.  Plus, he was calling in during the Trump interview.  I knew he was sick of talking about Bobcat Goldthwait.  He explained it all on his podcast before in a couple other interviews.  All right.  That's fine.  I put forth that we blow off Bobcat because of our loyalty to Jay Moore.  But like I said, I'm one voice.  And saw the movie.  You could have said yes.  Did you say yes to Bobcat?  I didn't even fucking contribute. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, okay.  I wait until you and Jimmy say something.  And then I just, okay, they agreed.  I don't have to say shit.  But with that said, I want to see the movie because you just turned me on to him.  Yeah, yeah.  Is he in the movie?  No.  Oh, that makes it even better.  He was in it.  Bill Murray's brother.  I didn't know that.  Which one?  Is that Bill Murray's brother?  That's Bill Murray's brother.  Brian Doyle Murray?  That's right.  No, the younger one.  Brian Doyle Murray's in that movie.  Brian Doyle.  Very cool.  But that's the reason I said no because the loyalty.  We have to Jay.  And Jay called during the Donald Trump Jr. interview. 
[02:40:30]  And then E-Rock wrote down everything Jay was saying.  So should I just read this?  The following is from Jay about Bobcat.  I'm all talked out about it.  Facts.  He walked out on my wife, not the other way around.  Okay.  Because what?  He's telling people that maybe she walked out on him.  All right.  Jay Moore is now married to Bobcat's ex.  Right.  He didn't want to marry his current wife because he said she was too fat. 
[02:41:00]  He says in many interviews that I steal my jokes.  He says in many interviews that I buy 100 tickets to each of his stand-up shows and cancel at the last minute.  That's hilarious.  At the last minute to make the room empty.  He owes my wife over 100 grand.  He borrowed 500,000 from her when she was 18.  Holy fuck.  She was making that much money at 18.  She was on that show on Happily Ever After.  Yeah.  Wow. 
[02:41:30]  I was making $200 a week at 18, and I thought I was rich.  $200 cash, kiddy.  Cash money.  Have him on if you want, but know what garbage he is.  Wow.  So there you go.  I don't need Bobcat on the show.  No.  I was just saying that I liked that movie.  I think our ladies are here.  Hello, ladies.  Where are the chicks?  Roland says they're coming.  Where are the bitches?  This has to be about 10 minutes. 
[02:42:00]  Thought you'd be up here with one of your bitches.  We look pathetic today.  Where are the seats?  No, you look good.  I don't care.  I'll cough right in her fucking face.  I'll cough right in her cunt.  What?  Too much?  Yeah, that was a little harsh.  I'm sorry.  We didn't even get to all our shit.  Pussy.  Jay-Z talks about gay marriage.  We didn't get to that.  What's the 12-year-old girl attacks Canadian banking system?  Is that good?  What?  It's actually a 12-year-old girl attacking the Canadian banking system.  Is it funny, though?  Well, no.  Smart Alec.  She just lays into the government making pretty good points. 
[02:42:30]  That's all.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I was kind of making the rounds today.  We haven't played the audio of the lady that hates the gays.  No.  What was that?  The town meeting or something?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, her.  Yeah, she's insane.  I remember her.  Yeah, she's just insane.  She's fucking crazy.  Maybe tomorrow we can play some of that.  Sure.  Yeah, it was such like a...  Because she just bounces around from non-sequitur to non-sequitur.  We didn't pull the audio because it's just better to just watch it.  Yeah, because there's no place...  She edits herself.  The full clip sounds like it's been edited. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah, because she just jumps around like crazy.  Where are the girls, man?  I know.  Where are they?  Where are the girls?  You know, they've got to walk in their high heels.  They walk all slow.  Danny's so excited.  Danny loves Justine J.  Danny really does.  I know.  She's so good.  So why don't you interview her?  We get to go home.  Yeah, you guys leave.  And just let Danny...  So I would just ask about her, like, if I could touch her and stuff.  Let's franchise this shit.  That's not an interview.  Well, it's a proposition.  So what do your underarms smell like? 
[02:43:30]  Oh, man.  I don't believe you.  I think we found an angle.  Fuck it.  Stick around.  Fuck it.  Yeah, but I'm telling you, it's not going to be interesting.  I'm just going to invite her to stuff.  Have her do the fart mask.  I'll be like, do you like to watch television at my house?  Do you like Primus?  I like Primus.  We're going to have Train on the show playing acoustically soon.  Next Tuesday.  Next Tuesday.  Yes.  I think that's cool.  I want more music acts.  Yeah, let's bring them in.  Oh, yeah.  Bring these girls in.  Relax. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, man.  What happened?  What is this?  What did they do to you over there?  Why are you always getting beat up?  They punch you?  Justine Jolie.  What happened?  I got hit in the face with a cowbell off of somebody's balls.  Just now?  Yeah.  Are you all right?  A cowbell flew off someone's balls and hit you in the face?  No, I actually had my face hit the cowbell.  Are you going to have a black eye?  Maybe.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  It wouldn't be the first time, though.  The first time I got a black eye, I actually gave it to myself because I can't do a backflip 
[02:44:30]  off of a diving board.  Oh, you hit the diving board on the way in?  No, I just hit my back, flat on my back.  My knees came up and hit me right in the fucking face.  Fuck.  It was pretty funny.  I had a black eye, and they actually, like, my teachers sent, um, oops, my teachers called  family services and was like, they're beating her.  She's got a black eye.  I'm like, no, really, I'm just a dumbass.  Well, I can see the bridge of your nose.  You got, like, a mark there.  It's happening.  Yeah, I do. 
[02:45:00]  Like, you're crinkling because I've got ice on my nose.  Was that over at Stern's, uh...  Yeah, Stern was mean to me.  He beat me.  He treated me like a red-headed stepchild.  And how exactly did the cowbell hit you, though?  No, my face actually had to hit the cowbell.  Seriously.  It was a very disturbing experience.  That's Nikki Benz, by the way.  Yes.  Looking very, very beautiful.  Hello.  Hi.  Hi.  So what happened from your vantage point?  She won.  I won.  And now I'm going to use that money to get therapy. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, huh?  What did you win?  $5,000.  For?  For doing pull-ups.  Sit-ups.  Sit-ups.  For the world's strongest woman.  There you go.  Because I work out all the time.  They got a shitload of money over there to fuck around with.  God, it's great.  Heather, you're very good at describing this because you saw it all.  Yeah, Heather saw the whole thing.  I'm the only one that didn't have to do this, but the ladies were doing sit-ups into a cowbell  that was connected to Sal's balls-out. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, okay.  Nice.  All right.  And we get to just talk to you.  So you're doing sit-ups.  God, we saw it.  But we were competing for $5,000.  Look, and we would love to do stuff with you guys.  For some reason, there's different rules around here.  We're not allowed to do shit.  How come?  We're not allowed to do shit.  You didn't hear anything about lawyers saying that you couldn't do that because the balls would,  you know, all I know, he was at least, Sal was at least kind enough to shave his balls  for us.  So that was nice.  You saw his balls?  I got too far up.  His asshole.  His asshole talked to us for a minute. 
[02:46:30]  He was behind the mic.  He threatened to fart on us.  Right.  She didn't.  Thank God.  We like Sally.  He's one of the good ones over there.  Wow.  I can't fucking, no, I can't believe this.  Yeah.  And we just got to talk to you, which isn't bad, I guess.  Five grand, huh?  And Heather, how do you say your last name?  It's Vandevin.  Vandevin.  Yeah, we've never talked to you before.  All penthouse pets in the studio.  We have talked to her before?  You have.  In studio?  Yeah.  She looks familiar, I remember. 
[02:47:00]  Oh my God.  She might have been a blonde before.  Did you have different color hair?  I did.  I did.  Oh my God.  No big deal.  Hey.  It's okay.  Hey, no, you're not an asshole.  Was that?  In the other room, Howard Stern, that's the asshole.  You don't like him?  No.  No.  Sal's asshole.  That's what we were talking about.  Literally.  We were talking about literal asshole.  And it's a lot of assholes, though.  I got confused.  I got confused there.  Howard's wonderful.  They were actually talking about an asshole.  Asshole.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Literally.  Gotcha.  So you get injured and you don't have been shit. 
[02:47:30]  I know.  I'm like, you're just going to hear crinkling from my mic.  No, the girl still won $500, which is pretty awesome.  Oh, yeah.  So they gave away $6,000 today?  Me too.  We have nothing for you.  We're both sick.  I've had the shits all morning.  You guys are super sweet.  Thank you for the water.  Oh, yeah.  Great.  Fucking bottle of water.  Hey, Nikki did it first.  That's great.  We're pathetic.  We fucking suck as a show.  We used to be so cool, though. 
[02:48:00]  I'll tell you that.  Oh, God.  The shit we used to be able to do.  Hey, where's your key?  They have their penthouse key.  You know what?  It's because I'm fired.  No, I just...  What?  What happened?  No, I forgot my key.  So I'm fired.  They took her key?  No, they didn't take my key.  All right, good.  They can't take my key.  No.  Actually, if I lose it, I have to buy a new one.  Are you over E-Rock's banking?  Remember that?  Remember the handprint on the ass?  I know.  I'm glad that E-Rock is as far away from me as he possibly can be.  I don't know if his wife now is cool with me being here.  Oh, I remember the whole thing, guys. 
[02:48:30]  Remember that?  Oh, yeah.  With the wife.  See, we used to do stuff.  Maybe that's why we're not allowed to do stuff.  Did you tell them?  Oh, um...  E-Rock spanked Justine so hard he left a handprint.  It was pretty violent.  It was pretty violent.  He's a fucking...  Lucasback.com decided that they were going to transcribe it.  Uh-huh.  If you read it, there's only...  I only repeat the word fuck one more time.  Like, I literally do an entire paragraph and a half of different curse words because  he hit me so fucking hard.  Oh.  Yeah, it really was hard.  It's pretty, uh...  It's pretty intense. 
[02:49:00]  It made a horrific noise and then broke blood vessels in her ass.  Yeah.  Um...  He bloodied her ass.  Yeah.  Danny's your biggest fan, Justine.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  He's out of his mind right now.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  He gets a hug.  It's good stuff right now.  He is literally in love with you.  Oh, thank you.  Did I just see a chubby?  No.  Oh, man.  Oh, E-Rock?  I'll tell you, to be honest with you, in the back office, I was a little bit because 
[02:49:30]  I kept popping up videos and I was just like, I was like, this is just going to be a problem  if I keep doing this today, so I just have to go somewhere else.  He wants to watch...  Oh, you needed to focus instead of thinking of...  Yeah, it was a bad time.  You needed to focus on a different brain instead of...  There's a rule here that they specify no fluids, so I didn't want to break that rule.  Oh, man.  I know, right?  He wants to watch movies with you.  The most fun part is when people start making fluid.  Yeah.  Right?  You know, it's actually the sign that a good time was had by all of us. 
[02:50:00]  That everything's happening.  It's all fun and games.  Where are you at with...  Anyone can answer this with snowballing.  We talked about snowballing today.  I don't even know what that is.  We didn't think people really did it.  Oh, my God.  And I actually...  I want to try it.  I totally want to try it.  Troy Connell do it.  Danny might do it with you.  Let me know.  What is this?  A guy comes to your mouth and then you kiss him with his thumb in your mouth.  Most guys don't like that.  Thank you, Nikki Benz.  But if you had another girl in the bed and they were totally down, that would be a hot 
[02:50:30]  snowballing.  From girl to girl.  From girl to girl.  I've done that.  There come...  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I've done that.  Was that hot?  I call it cum-swapping.  I don't know.  You're right.  That might not be some...  You've got to fancy it up.  Snowballing.  I like that.  I do.  Snowballing.  Next time I'm going to do a movie, I'll be like, let me snowball you.  And she'll be like, what?  And I'll be like, I'll spit it in her face.  I don't know if you want to spit it in her eye, though.  I'll be careful.  It's got to be a romantic, gentle transfer over the tongues. 
[02:51:00]  And then you've got to pull apart and leave a big string in between.  You know?  Let everybody know what you did.  I'm getting the sexy visual now in my head.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Aren't you going around to the world in 80 fucks?  Oh, shit.  What is that about?  Isn't that great?  Please explain that one.  I'm taking a three to four week vacation.  Going to Europe, Spain.  I'm going to go to France, Italy.  Can I hook up with Donald Trump Jr.?  He's over there.  Is he?  So I hear.  No. 
[02:51:30]  He ran away.  Does he look like his dad?  No, not really.  Thank God.  He's a very handsome man.  He's not rocking the comb over.  No.  No.  I don't know what he looks like.  So I have to ask.  Donnie Trump Jr. is a very handsome man.  He is.  He's not.  No.  Maybe I'll snowball him.  I don't know.  Oh, there you go.  I'd love to hear that.  Nice.  Good job bringing it back around.  Good job.  Yeah.  So what is this around the world?  Not around the world, but Europe and also possibly Morocco.  And I want to, my friend and I, we're kind of crazy together, but we want to fuck guys 
[02:52:00]  in different countries and kind of map it out.  I want to experience different lovers.  Like I want to experience an Italian lover, a Spanish lover in those countries.  So you're going to do that, film it?  If they'll let us film it, yes.  But I got an idea where I'll just take a Polaroid of their penis so I have a memory of it.  Oh, that's sweet.  Sweet, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And maybe I'll snowball one of them.  I don't know.  You don't know.  And then what?  Would you kind of write about how good they are or bad? 
[02:52:30]  Yeah, we're making like a Eurosex diary.  Oh, man.  That's a good idea, right?  That is pretty goddamn good.  Yeah.  What about America?  I've already been around the world.  Yeah.  Every city, you think, at this point?  Not every city, no.  No.  How about every state?  Please don't say Detroit.  No.  Not yet.  Oh, boy.  But, you know, my main purpose is not to go there for sex.  I'm going there on vacation.  What?  But, I mean, definitely sex is going to be a big part of it.  How are you going to get the guys? 
[02:53:00]  Are you just going to go to, like, a club and pick up on a guy?  Well, if it happens, it happens.  If it doesn't, I will roofie somebody and make it happen.  No, I'm kidding.  I don't think you'd have to, to tell you the truth.  You just walk into a club and say, I sure would like to fuck some guy.  And I bet I get some takers.  I think all you have to do is sit down on a chair or a bench and be like, oh, yeah.  Be like, oh, I'm sorry.  My legs just fell open.  Yeah.  You girls got that shit knocked.  Yeah.  And if there's some alcohol in me, it's bad for my legs.  It makes them spread. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  You're a little promiscuous when you drink?  Aren't we all?  Yeah, totally.  Wait, so lunch.  What are you drinking?  Oh, man, right?  A little liquid lunch?  Yeah.  Never a bad thing.  That shit's good.  Boy, if I didn't have TV to do, I'd drink and fuck with you guys.  It'd be great.  I could take a Polaroid on my dick.  Isn't that what you were planning on doing? 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  He just stole my idea.  I know.  I'm a thief.  Yeah.  What about Heather?  What are you up to?  Um, God, I wish, no, it's like, I'm in Pilates teacher training.  Wow.  Wow.  Watch out, everybody.  I'm going to come and get you.  All right.  Great, great news, Nana.  Exactly.  That's how I feel.  It's tough to follow up fucking the world, I know.  Yeah, she's fucking the world.  I don't know if you're going for three weeks turned into fucking the world. 
[02:54:30]  I don't know.  Oh, sorry.  Thank you.  It was me saying around the world at 80 fucks.  I would love for Heather to be my Pilates teacher.  I can totally do that.  That'd be hot.  Can you stretch me out later, Heather?  I will stretch you out, and I will get you a martini.  Okay.  Oh, man.  It's going to get crazy.  And I'll tell you what.  Yeah.  Make it pillow fight?  I have a serious boyfriend of three years.  That's awesome.  Oh, you do.  Isn't that exciting, you guys?  What?  Truck one?  What's exciting is watching him spank your ass. 
[02:55:00]  That's exciting.  Actually, we do get pretty sexy with each other.  Big cock?  Yeah, big cock.  Got to have a big cock.  That's good.  Once you've been with big cocks, you know what's good.  Yeah.  The big cock's good.  That's a fallacy that, you know, oh, the size doesn't matter, right?  No, it's nice to have a little bit of everything.  Little skills, large cock.  Yeah.  Sometimes when it's too big, it honestly just hurts. 
[02:55:30]  Well, you don't want that.  No.  Yeah, it's...  It's like the beginning of a video game where you're building your character up and you've  got to put attributes on it.  It's like, oh, I could go with fucking 12 inches with zero fucking, you know, like movement.  But I'll cut down on the length.  Yes.  Give a little movement.  A little girth.  Get some girth.  Yeah.  Yeah, and you've got to kind of, you know, bounce it all out.  Then you name it.  Then you do some fucking.  Yes.  Sounds like you have a lot of experience with this.  Are you rocking a large...  No, it's video games. 
[02:56:00]  Supposedly Anthony's got a big one.  Okay.  No.  Supposedly?  I don't know.  Any Polaroids I can look at?  No.  I probably have a picture on my phone, but...  Ooh, pass it this way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can you pass the phone to them?  Or at least show them from afar?  Pass the phone.  Can you show them from afar?  It's not like you're going to run away with your phone to the bathroom and have, like,  you know, a selfie and film it for you.  Let's see if I have it.  I want to hear their reaction.  I don't need to see it, but I want to hear their reaction.  That would be hilarious.  Oh, and he has two phones. 
[02:56:30]  Oh.  Everyone does these days.  True.  So, um, how about...  He's finding the picture for you.  Oh.  I think he might be game for this.  Yeah.  Speaking of games...  Oh, right.  I'm speaking of games.  Hey.  Speaking of designing your perfect character...  This game's been out a while, though.  Yes.  Why are we promoting it today?  I'm confused.  Because it's been...  It came out on November 15th, 2011, but our penthouse...  DLC pack.  DLC pack is coming out May 22nd, and you get to play us, and they, the characters look 
[02:57:00]  like us.  Exactly.  Cool.  You get to call us into your posse, and we get to, you know...  I deleted it.  ...tear apart Steelport with you.  What?  I did.  I would show you.  No, you didn't.  I swear.  You look that way, and I don't know.  No, no, no.  No, it's true.  I think you look that way.  No, you got caught.  No, I was actually looking...  Did you get a little nervous?  No, I was looking at other pics of, like, girls.  Right.  I wasn't looking at me.  Right.  I would show it.  I swear.  All right, well, let me see the other pictures of girls.  Yeah, they're fucking...  Mm-hmm. 
[02:57:30]  I just called you out.  Did you?  Yeah.  How does that work?  Let me see your penis.  How's that working for you?  Not so well.  I love you.  It's not working at all.  Oh, yeah.  So Saints Row, the third, out now for Xbox and PS3.  Yes.  And PC.  Featuring you guys.  And PC, of course.  All right.  Yes.  And the characters look like us.  The only thing that they did was make my boobies slightly smaller and Heather's bigger.  Whoa.  And mine bigger as well.  I was really kind of stoked about that.  I love being a cartoon character with big, big titties. 
[02:58:00]  And this matters because you can actually play us naked.  Yeah, you can.  Wow.  Yeah.  Oh.  Right?  And don't forget, you can also tear apart steel port with a...  dildo bat, air support, and Professor Genki's super ethical reality climax, which is actually  one of my favorite parts of the game, the shoot-em-up Professor Genki, who I'm wearing  today.  That's who I'm wearing.  Oh, I see that.  He's the cat character.  It's actually...  It's a great way to earn money and also to earn respect within the game, which is really 
[02:58:30]  important.  Do they have a cowbell on testicles that you could throw at your nose?  They better fucking not.  Your nose?  It's like, ah, get my gun and go shoot some...  Well, actually, I'm sorry.  My big purple dildo bat.  Yeah.  Purple dildo bat.  You're damn right.  It's like 12 feet wide.  Wait, what?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  What?  Really?  Wait, Danny's got it?  Danny's got one.  Wow.  Okay, yay.  Oh, maybe we can get something going.  Yeah, maybe we can hit each other.  That was a maniacal laugh.  That was a maniacal laugh.  That was pretty fucking awesome. 
[02:59:00]  They're excited.  They're coming in with it.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  Look at him.  What is this?  What is this?  Hey, shit.  Is that from the game?  Yes.  This is from the game.  I'm describing approximately...  What is this?  That's fucking hilarious.  A four-foot purple dildo bat.  I found this in the office yesterday.  It's been my favorite thing for the last 24 hours.  It's a dildo bat.  You're right.  Hey, can we pose the girls with the dildo bat?  That's like three feet long, right?  Yeah.  Let's Instagram this shit.  Yes, please.  Why, uh...  Here, you girls get together for this picture. 
[02:59:30]  See, now that's too long, right?  Yeah.  That would hurt, right?  You can't bury that balls deep.  No.  Well, you guys got to get really close.  You know this.  Move close to the console.  And move the mic, please.  And make sure your boobies show.  Especially the nipple part.  Oh, look.  She's putting the balls in her mouth.  All right, hold on.  Like that.  Here we go.  She's teabagging.  One, two.  Oh, beautiful.  I'm Instagramming that shit. 
[03:00:00]  Hopey Radio.  Okay, who wants to turn?  Let's do that shit.  What, with a bat?  What do you mean?  Yeah.  What do you do with that in the game?  You ride it like a little horse thing.  Here we go.  What do you do with that in the game?  Oh, you beat people with it.  Beat people?  Can you beat up Danny with it?  You totally can't hear me with it.  Danny, you want to take a couple shots from the dildo bat?  That looks heavy.  Justine, she can do anything she wants to.  All right, here we go.  All right, she's hitting your ass with the big purple dildo.  Yeah, I can take that.  That's all right. 
[03:00:30]  I'll take some purple dicks today.  That thing is hilarious.  You're so sweet to him.  I know.  Yeah, you don't have it.  I'm filthy.  You can really.  Don't hold back.  You can spit in my mouth.  Yeah.  Whatever you want.  Oh, man.  It doesn't really do a good spank thing.  It's more like a bludgeon.  We're all taking turns?  We are.  I think I'm going to surprise you.  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, well, too bad, huh?  Oh, shit.  My wife just fucking comes at you.  Oh, man.  She's spearing you.  I'm an asshole.  Wait, no.  She's going underneath. 
[03:01:00]  You almost tapped me in the balls.  Heather's angry.  It's really clear.  Heather's angry.  She's just getting right there.  It's really close.  It's that perfect just tap.  Yeah.  It wakes you up really good.  But when I do it, you have to say, I love when Nicky Benz snowballs me.  No, I'm not saying that.  I'm kidding.  All right.  Oh, here she goes.  Oh, Jesus.  What are you, a cop?  Wow.  Yeah, but you know what, though?  That thing has so much mass. 
[03:01:30]  It really does.  Dude, it really weighs like 10 pounds.  It's heavy.  I'm sorry.  No, it's fine.  It's like, you know that story that you tell about hitting your sister with the stretch Armstrong?  Yeah, yeah.  It's the same thing.  It's like stretch Armstrong, yeah.  It's a cement dick.  But only a big cock.  So that's in the game.  That's fucking funny.  It's a huge cock.  That's what this is.  It is a huge cock.  All right.  Just a big old purple dick.  What type of sexploits are you guys into on film these days?  You do anything?  Still girls.  Still, you know, all ladies. 
[03:02:00]  All ladies.  All ladies.  Never any dick?  Not on film.  Why is that?  I lay lots of pipe in my private life.  Why is that, though?  Because I would lose my private life.  Oh.  Yeah.  And I'm a pretty big freak on the side.  I mean, I now have a boyfriend and a girlfriend, and I'm trying to figure out how to work and  keep all three people happy.  Good luck.  I was talking about-  Yeah, my life sucks.  I was talking about the threesome thing before when I was married.  My wife was kind of into that.  And it was always just fucking the new stranger in bed and at arm's length just diddling the 
[03:02:30]  wife like, meh, who gives a shit?  I'll fuck away.  Oh, wow.  Oh, please.  That doesn't work.  Dude, I had an awesome three-way recently that was just amazing.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Troy Kwan?  Huh?  What made it amazing?  I just assumed.  He's a rock star.  Yeah.  The fact that we got to switch and swap the entire time, it was pretty awesome and amazing.  It doesn't always happen.  I don't know.  I kind of just like fucking the strange person in the bed.  Yeah, this is a repeat someone, too. 
[03:03:00]  Just enough.  It's like, take your forefinger and just rub your wife's thigh.  Here.  You digging that, honey?  Because I'm really enjoying being balls deep in this new girl that I don't even know her  name.  It's fantastic.  Oh, God.  That ended in divorce, by the way.  Yeah.  Figure that one out.  She gave me an ultimatum.  That girl or me?  And take the highway.  Take the old highway.  That's what I told her.  I was with that threesome girl for nine years. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  How about that, right?  Nine years, huh?  That's nice, right?  Maybe eight.  Maybe eight.  Eight or nine years.  That worked out for you.  Yeah, it did.  It kind of did.  I'm glad I got rid of the wife.  She was atrocious.  Fucking horrible person to be around.  It was terrible.  That sounds awful.  The only good thing was she allowed me to fuck other girls that came into the bed.  Oh, God.  And then she was like, she would say this to her.  This was the best.  In the morning, like, we'd wake up. 
[03:04:00]  It was like Saturday morning, fucking put on TV.  And then she'd be like, I'm going to take a shower.  And she had this rule, like, no fucking around unless she was present.  The second I heard that fucking bathroom door shut, bam, just start fucking the third girl  in the bed.  What am I supposed to do?  I sure as shit wasn't going to cuddle.  Shmuddle.  I wanted that new ass.  It's great.  You know how it is.  That's why I don't think threesomes work very well. 
[03:04:30]  You're always going to favor one, I think.  It's usually the wife, right?  Or the girlfriend.  No, fuck her.  You can fuck her any time.  To be effective to keep it going over years.  We're talking about the long game, not the short game.  We want to be able to have our partner and be able to bring in new people on a regular basis.  I just think, why am I wasting time fucking this when I could be fucking that?  Yeah.  Wow.  That's a basic logic.  Intense. 
[03:05:00]  I love how this turned into therapy for you.  Yeah.  You're looking at me like, why are you telling us this?  I don't know.  I just figure you girls got some great stories, too.  Yeah.  You're on film, right?  I haven't shot porn in over a year.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  Your choice?  I was with Penthouse under contract, and I was just making appearances,  and I also had a steady boyfriend, so I was only with him.  Oh, and he didn't like that?  It wasn't even him or I not liking it. 
[03:05:30]  It was just Penthouse didn't shoot me.  They sent me to different promotional events.  Oh, shit.  Okay.  And I was okay with that.  What about you on film?  Anything good?  You know, I've only had sex with women on film.  God, what is that?  Like, I mean, it's cool and everything, but it's like odd that, you know.  You know, not really.  I think once you get into the industry, there's certain levels.  Of sexuality that you're comfortable with.  Anal's like the ultimate, right?  That's like the ultimate level.  Well, what is the ultimate?  You know what the ultimate is, I think?  It's some of those.  Belladonna? 
[03:06:00]  Like, hardcore.  When they write the C word on your forehead?  That's good.  No, no, no.  Fucking slap happy.  Where they put things in your ass and have you, like, water, and then shoot it back out.  And masturbate at the same time.  And have interracial sex with people.  I don't like that at all.  With people, while you're also, like, licking dog balls.  That's probably the ultimate.  Multitasking.  So it's all multitasking these days.  Do you know I'm actually scarred right now?  There's so many.  Holy shit.  We're learning there's so many levels, Ed.  Wow.  What's the first level? 
[03:06:30]  Imagine the one poor dog.  You're just kind of tickling his balls a little.  Letting the other one fuck you real hard.  Huh?  Oh, first level.  Stella, masturbation.  Because it's your dog.  Yeah.  Taking pictures like Playboy taking pictures.  I want to know the levels now.  So the first level is just masturbating on film by yourself.  Not even.  It's just Playboy style nudes.  No spread.  No spread.  No pink.  That's just kind of with a beautiful music.  And they're just kind of walking through their house.  And they're just looking at the camera with sultry face.  Yeah.  All right.  That's level one.  Then level two.  Level two is... 
[03:07:00]  There's that.  And then there's the dog balls.  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  Fair enough.  That's your place.  Yeah, that's your scale.  Gnarly lipstick, dick dog, fucking licking peanut butter off of Snatch.  Wow.  There's lots of room to choose what it's going to be.  No, but it happens.  We've seen it.  The internet's amazing these days.  We've all seen bestiality.  In Sweden, I've heard it's still legal.  Legal?  Is it?  I swear.  How is that possible?  Bestiality's legal.  Portions of New Zealand that's legal to marry are cheap. 
[03:07:30]  What?  Why would you marry it?  That's so weird.  Lots of sheep.  I guess it's just the one sheep you want to be with.  Yeah.  I just found the perfect sheep.  Why have you committed to just one?  There's so many.  Yeah, commit yourself to one.  Oh, my God.  That's terrible.  The threesome with the sheep.  You're just kind of like, meh.  Dude.  There's my wife's sheep.  I'm just going to barely take care of her.  Is there a question to do?  Is there a question to do?  Is there a question to do?  Is there a stranger's sheep?  Yeah.  You're a German.  That's strange sheep.  There's Troy Kwan.  That's the guy I keep mentioning because he's so sexy. 
[03:08:00]  He got snowballed by someone very famous in your industry.  Yes.  A long time ago.  But he doesn't name names, which is amazing, because I would have bragged about it.  I also want to mention that Roland wants to get spanked.  Oh, Roland.  Roland wants to get spanked.  Last time I saw Roland in an erotic place.  It was a strip club in Cleveland.  And he came twice in his pants.  Oh, you dirty dog.  Having a dance in the back room.  And he wanted to go for three, right?  Troy?  Yeah.  He's popping off shots all night. 
[03:08:30]  Roland, you want to get spanked with a big purple dildo bat?  Get spanked.  I'm good.  What about a little lap dance or something?  I'm good.  What if you close your eyes?  I may believe one of the girls is Bruce Springsteen.  Because he loves Bruce.  He's actually hiding back there.  He is hiding.  What's going on with him?  Are you shy, Roland?  I'm shy.  I spanked him really hard the last time I was here.  Yes, you did.  He's hiding from me.  All right.  I remember.  I got that off.  Yeah, move that sound.  Good man.  There he is.  Roland, you're scared of Mickey Benz who spanked you last time?  Yeah, I'm good. 
[03:09:00]  But Troy, he should get spanked, though.  He slowballs and all the balls.  Troy looks like he's up for it.  Troy's down for whatever.  Troy's got that poly D hair.  Oh, wow.  Oh, and here's the, you look more like, I would say, more of a 50s greaser feel, which is  a good look.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You just need a leather jacket, darling.  Oh, man.  You like that look?  Is that good or bad, Justine Jolie?  That's good.  I'd take you out for drinks.  I'd take you out for drinks.  Sort of a James Dean thing going on, right?  Yeah.  What are you talking about my TARDIS for?  No, James Dean. 
[03:09:30]  Oh.  So what's up?  Wait, no, seriously.  I thought you were talking about.  Oh, wow.  What are you down for, Troy?  Whatever.  What are we doing?  We're just like eye-fucking you.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, cool.  Maybe you should take your shirt off and let us smack your chest.  Smack my chest?  Why my chest?  All right, now we're talking about this.  Sounds really good.  I want to see your nipples.  I have fucked up nipples.  And he's got a lot.  Because I have nipple rings and I got them both ripped out.  Really?  It should just be him taking off his shirt, though.  That's not fair.  I'm not taking off my shirt.  That's not fair. 
[03:10:00]  Everybody take your shirts off.  Oh, yeah.  They can take their shirts off.  Absolutely.  If I can take my shirts off, you girls got to take yours off as well.  I got to see this, Heather.  What's fair is fair?  Fair is fair.  What's fair is fair?  Fair is fair.  Fair is fair.  Yeah.  Fair is fair.  We're using Troy Kahn to get the girls' shirts off.  It's amazing.  Then what?  You're going to smack my chest.  Oh, man.  Yeah, that's what they want to do.  Well, how did they get ripped out, your nipple rings?  Oh, man.  The first one, I was in a band and I stage died.  And somebody just ripped it out and I came back on stage and it just felt hot.  The second one, this one over here, this one's a little more mutated. 
[03:10:30]  I was having sex with my...  Why don't you take your shirt off while you tell us the story?  Yeah, no, seriously.  Just take your damn shirt off.  This is pretty impressive.  Yeah, this one, I was having sex with my girlfriend at the time and she had one of  those horseshoe ones.  Oh.  You know what I'm talking about?  Like the circular barbells?  Yes.  And I had a regular ring in it and they got linked and I pulled up and it ripped right  out.  Wow.  What are the odds of that happening?  Yeah.  Like a magic trick.  There's just blood everywhere.  It looked like a crime scene.  Wow.  You said yours, too.  After you get yours off first.  Oh, okay.  Well, deal's a deal.  A deal's a deal.  Oh, man.  Look at that.  Yeah. 
[03:11:00]  All right.  So, what's up?  Lovely sleeves.  What's up?  Lovely sleeves.  Awesome.  Good job.  Oh, whatever.  And?  Oh, she just fucked you over.  Oh, she fucked you over, Troy.  She's got her bra.  Take the bra off.  Oh, man.  Oh, I like that.  There we go.  She gets right to it.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  Hold on.  We got to mic this shit.  She has such great perky titties.  Wait.  We're all going to see you.  Good God.  Man.  Yeah.  Thank God for Troy Kwan.  Thank God we have a real man in here.  Oh, shit.  Oh, she just pinched Troy Kwan's nipple. 
[03:11:30]  Not really.  Oh, now there's a big purple cock across Troy Kwan's chest.  Make it good.  Make it good.  Oh, man.  Don't put him in cardiac arrest.  Oh.  Right across his lips.  On your lips.  Oh, man.  Look at what shot is that.  Remember, Danny's been playing with that all week.  You know, it's really depressing around here when you're not good looking or rich.  Yeah.  So that was it?  That's the shot I got?  Yeah.  I just wanted to do better than that. 
[03:12:00]  Look at that.  We're getting titties in here.  Oh, like your chest.  Holy shit.  Yeah, if you want.  What's going on?  I'm just going to pinch the other nipple when you're done.  Oh, yeah?  Hard?  Yeah, as hard as you can.  He said hard.  He doesn't care.  Nikki doesn't fuck around.  You're going to get a shot.  I just don't want to hit the girls.  He said hard.  All right.  Make it hard.  You guys hurt this.  Oh, we hurt.  Just don't hit him in the heart.  I don't feel like dealing with a heart attack.  Troy's real, man.  Oh.  That's like a punch.  That wasn't much.  He hit me in the stomach.  He hit me in the chest.  Because he just told me I don't. 
[03:12:30]  All right.  Just hit him wherever the fuck you want.  No, no, no.  Okay.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  That was good.  That was a good one.  Yeah.  That was a good one.  You sure?  Yeah.  He's down for whatever, man.  Oh, shit.  Harder?  I don't want to hurt you.  You're not hurting me.  Go ahead.  She's getting scared.  Go ahead.  Go for it.  Go ahead, Nikki.  Benz.  Oh.  Oh, shit.  That was a good one.  Good job.  Wow.  Troy likes a little pain.  Yeah. 
[03:13:00]  Nikki Benz's apology is to take her shirt off.  Yeah, there you go.  I'm sorry.  She pulls out her boobs.  Sorry.  Let me take my tits out.  But I did get off on it.  That's how they deal with it.  They take their tits out.  How is that, Troy?  It's good.  Yeah.  Where's Roland, though?  He sneaked the fuck out.  Oh, that fucking asshole left.  Yeah, he ran away.  Oh, man.  Ran away.  Look at this variety of tits we have, Opie, here.  One of these is amazing.  All sizes are represented.  They're all gargantuan.  I love how Nikki's actually fucking her microphone with her boobies right now. 
[03:13:30]  And then the nice perkia.  That scratchy, you hear, is her titties against the microphone.  What are the sizes here?  I am, this is Nikki here.  I am a 34 double D.  Her nipples are very hard.  Or a super grande.  I'm a 34 D.  This is Heather Vandenberg.  Oh, yeah.  And I'm a 34 B.  Yeah.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Teeny titties.  There's nothing wrong with that.  You could get a dick between those.  I want to. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah.  There you go.  You know what?  You've got to squeeze them really fucking hard.  That's right.  Unless you have a big dick.  Nah, that'll work.  And then, you know.  Yeah, and then, well.  I want to hear this story.  It's mostly my sternum.  It's sternum fucking.  Yeah, I didn't want to bring it up, but now Nikki did.  What's up with the left boob?  Well, my left boob has bruises on it, and that was because my husband grabbed them a little  too hard the other day.  I like my titties.  I like my titties.  Grabs instead of like, playing with Nikki's nipples, just lightly greasing my fingers across  is pretty awesome, but I don't like that.  He like left bruises and like some broken blood vessels. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  That's pretty hot.  Shit, yeah?  I'm getting turned on.  Does he get your ass to?  Listening to that?  Does he like smack your ass and fucking bite it?  Yeah.  Yeah?  I prefer my back being bitten instead of my butt.  Really?  Do you have your back bitten?  No, no.  Could Danny bite it?  No bite marks?  Could Danny bite your back?  No.  All right.  Just figure we'd ask.  Danny wants to do something.  Can Danny fuck you in the ass?  Danny can actually kiss you right here, though.  Let's just ask right to the point.  Can Danny just fuck you in the ass without a condom?  Danny's cute. 
[03:15:00]  You can kiss her on the neck.  That's not bad.  Right here.  Oh, your beard is soft.  I was wondering.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  Look, she got a little nipply there on that one.  Yeah.  Pretty good.  God, tits always stop the conversation, doesn't it?  What's that?  I wasn't listening to.  I know, it's just nonsense now.  It really is.  Well, we should get to that.  Oh, ladies.  Let's make sure we get.  What a treat.  Well, let's make sure they get followers.

Yeah, you obviously don't follow.  No, I follow a lot of people.  I'll tweet this picture with all your Twitter accounts, and then I'll follow all of you.  What the hell?  Thank you.  Mostly it's like, you know, New York Times and CNN and shit like that. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah.  I think we could get a better picture of you guys.  I think so, too.  It's good.  Now he's like, well, now that your shirts are off.  But most of the stupid picture sites take off the nude pictures.  They really are just assholes.  Where's your phone?  All right, listen.  Saints Row the Third out now for Xbox and PS3.  Yes.  And PC.  And PC.  Use that fucking bat.  Purple dildo.  Use that purple dildo bat and get, you know, take apart steel water.  Take it back from the syndicate.  I'll tell you what, though.  Troy Kwan was able to fucking deflect that one. 
[03:17:00]  Troy Kwan should be in the game.  He's just like, gets hit with the purple dildo.  It didn't hurt?  She got some power in her, though.  Could they punch you in the face?  Punch me in the face?  No, I will break it.  And he's so pretty.  No.  We're not going to break him.  You guys right?  I'll take a punch in the chest.  Yeah.  Wow.  I think he likes being abused.  Yeah, I was like, wow, you really are glutton for punishment.  He's done for whatever.  Can I come to my dungeon piggy?  Yeah, let's do it.  Oh, man. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, shit.  Fucking hilarious.  Yeah, right.  Troy Kwan's down for whatever.  Whatever.  I'm just warming up for whatever.  Let's get crazy.  He's just warming up.  Don't challenge us, because then it's going to get ugly.  Okay.  What's up?  Oh, can't get ugly with Troy Kwan in the room.  What else could you do, though?  I will work out of both his tipples.  Oh, shit.  I won't.  Get him off of those pearly, beautiful legs.  What else do we have?  I don't know this topless girl here with a bruised tit and ice on her nose.  This is fucking great, man.

What's going to be funnier is when we turn up tomorrow and I've got black eyes.  You guys are just going to be like, I'm going to blame it on you.  As long as it's a black eye.  I'm going to say that they beat me.  I don't like when you say that.  I got it.  They beat me with their titties. 
[03:18:30]  I have to say, I've had a very interesting morning.  Yeah.  That is.  What do you guys got planned for the rest of the day?  What are you doing the rest of the day, girls?  More radio.
