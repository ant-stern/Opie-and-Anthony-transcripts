<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, jumping frequently between subjects with characteristically crude humor and often offensive language.  The show began with a discussion of the Yankees-Orioles playoff game, focusing on manager Joe Girardi's decisions regarding Alex Rodriguez and a near-miss injury from a broken bat.  One host, Travis, expressed ambivalent support for the Orioles.  This transitioned into a review of the Vice Presidential debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan, featuring audio clips and heavily biased commentary, interspersed with tangents about a diamond planet and various political parties.  The hosts’ commentary included frequent interruptions and vulgar language, with criticisms leveled at both candidates' styles and debate performance.  Their opinions on different news networks' coverage were also voiced, again with strong biases.

Next, the show heavily featured a viral video depicting a bus driver punching a female passenger.  The hosts and an unidentified person debated the justification for the driver’s actions, considering the passenger's aggressive behavior and speculating on her background. This discussion, filled with offensive language and derogatory terms, continued into a later segment.  This second discussion on the bus incident involved a play-by-play commentary of the video, extensive listener feedback, much of it supportive of the driver, and a subsequent debate about the Vice Presidential debate, this time centering on Biden's apparent amusement.  This led to broader conversations about political cynicism and the nature of political debates, culminating in a heated debate between a caller identifying as a truck driver (claiming the Afghanistan war was about opium and rare earth minerals) and another caller, a soldier, who strongly disagreed, using highly offensive language.

The show also included discussions about:  a correction regarding a previous baseball game result; the hosts' differing sports allegiances (including one identifying as a Brooklyn Nets fan); criticism of Lindsay Lohan's father for leaking a phone conversation; speculation about Barbara Streisand's Brooklyn concert; a graphic and explicit discussion about personal hygiene, specifically anal cleanliness, involving multiple callers;  NBA playoff home court advantage; NHL rule changes, particularly the removal of the red line;  a story about comedian Ben Creed being defended by Darren Bavacqua;  a burlesque song and sexually suggestive sitcoms, specifically "I Dream of Jeannie";  and  a lengthy reminiscence about Dangerfield's comedy club.

Bill Burr appeared as a guest, discussing the "Night of Too Many Stars" charity event and his experience on "Inside the NFL," interspersed with further Yankees playoff talk.  The show also featured a significant segment dedicated to Playboy Playmates.  This involved an in-studio interview with a Playboy casting representative and three potential Playmates. The discussion included details about the casting process, the Playmates' backgrounds, their comfort levels with nudity,  their tattoos, and their personal lives, often accompanied by vulgar humor.  The Playmates partially disrobed on-air.   Another segment included a discussion of a woman's business proposal, followed by a lengthy, sexually explicit conversation about various sexual acts, body hygiene and preferences involving the hosts, Bill (a male guest who left around [03:21:30]), and the three Playboy Playmates. The discussion included specific details about Playboy's casting requirements and the hosts' prior experiences with nude guests. The show concluded with advertisements and the hosts’ closing remarks.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Friday!  Yes, it is. Friday.  It's that, it's that, what do you say first, crap?  You know what? I'm not going to say anything.  Oh, that's good. That's a...  Ah, shit, I blew it.  By saying something?  Yes. Ah, see how that works?  Morning, everyone.  Hi.  Morning.  Morning.  Uh, uh, Yankees! 
[00:00:30]  Wow, oh boy.  Yankees!  Travis is happy.  Yeah, he was so depressed yesterday, but now today, you know, life has been breathed back into the Orioles fans.  And, uh, eh, now it comes down to today.  Uh, last game, Yankees reels for the, uh, uh, for moving ahead and playing, uh, the Tigers, I gather.  I'm going to, I'm going to state the obvious.  Yeah.  What the fuck's wrong with Girardi? 
[00:01:00]  Uh, he, he makes the right move.  Right.  He makes the right move.  24 hours later, it doesn't mean that it's not still the right move.  Keep that fucker off the goddamn...  He takes A-Rod out of the game.  Away from the plate!  Banez.  Yep.  Uh, hits the two home runs.  Yankees win.  And then it's time for the next game.  Yeah.  And there's A-Rod in the starting lineup.  What, what is wrong with you?  What position did he have in?  Uh, I think they moved him down to fifth, right?  Yeah. 
[00:01:30]  They moved him to fifth, but I mean...  Why would you do that?  Because it did, again, another opportunity with men on base.  And look, I understand.  The Yankee bats aren't fucking going insane.  That's for sure.  But it's all about momentum.  Momentum.  And he figured it out.  And the crowd was into the move.  It worked for the team.  And then the next day, everyone's got to be rolling their eyes like,  what are you doing?  The guy's obviously, you know, in a horrible slump, to say, A-Rod.  Yeah.  Horrible slump.  And then you put him back in the lineup.  What did he have? 
[00:02:00]  Like a bloop single or something last night?  And that was it?  Yeah, yeah.  He finally, it was amazing how many people were just like,  I was out to dinner, but the game was on.  Right.  In the restaurant.  And when he blooped a little single in, everybody was like, sarcastically,  everyone went, yeah, yeah, like he hit a home run.  You knew it was sarcastic, right?  Of course it was sarcastic.  Because it's New York.  Yeah.  And then I know, you know, they finally took him out in the end there  for a pinch hitter, and that failed.  Day late and a dollar short, that one right there.  But I'm just thinking, you get him out of the fucking lineup, 
[00:02:30]  just pull him.  Maybe you bring him in to pinch hit.  I don't even think you'd do that.  It's like, you can't pull your multi-million dollar piece.  Yes, you can.  If you want to fucking win the game.  So Girardi got caught up in politics, obviously.  Politics.  Because this guy has no business being in the starting lineup at this time.  None.  Nope.  None business.  You know, you try to wrap up this series,  you keep him out of the lineup,  and then maybe you start him fresh with the next series.  With the next series.  If you're moving on.  Exactly.  It just didn't make sense to me. 
[00:03:00]  And I'm not, you know, I'm not a huge Yankees fan.  I'm not a Yankees fan at all, but it just seems like it wasn't the right call.  Again, man, in scoring opportunity, it could have, you know, put the game away.  And whiff, whiff, whiff.  Yeah.  It's just, it was frustrating to watch.  But, yeah, Orioles and Yankees again at the stadium today.  And this is for it.  That's it.  Comes down to one game.  That's kind of cool.  It is kind of cool if the Yankees win. 
[00:03:30]  It's kind of cool if you're not, you know, a fan of either team.  And that's a fun game just to watch as a sports fan.  Yeah.  They've been amazingly close games.  It's all been about the pitching.  That broken bat that hit.  Oh, hit Jabba.  Chamberlain, yeah.  Holy shit.  And before that, I swear I was just talking about how,  because you see a few broken bats during the game.  And I was just talking about how amazing it is that you haven't seen somebody impaled  with one of these bats.  It's the heavy barrel end of the bat with a sharp fucking vampire killer stake at the end. 
[00:04:00]  And it just goes flying out into the infield.  Jabba turned.  He, like, delivered the pitch.  And then he kind of turned around like, oh, well, I don't have to look anymore.  And that fucking piece of bat, it was all because of the way it was spinning that he  didn't get killed.  It's just the luck of the spin.  He's lucky his neck didn't get hit or his eye was fucking, that was brutal.  Yeah.  That is kind of scary, huh? 
[00:04:30]  Travis, you don't need to be in here today.  Travis, very happy.  Yeah, fuck this guy.  He's got his Orioles shirt on.  I'm not miserable.  His 2012 American League playoffs Baltimore Orioles t-shirt.  Yeah, it worked yesterday.  You don't wish you were there yesterday?  Wait, you just got a playoff shirt?  Yeah, of course I did.  Why not?  Are you rolling?  You would have been there for this game.  Oh, man.  Yeah, you were supposed to go yesterday.  I was not supposed to have tickets.  We told you to go.  Yep, that would have been something.  You going today? 
[00:05:00]  No.  You're not going to go.  I will watch from my house.  Your team that you grew up with is a mere, what, 15 miles from here?  Tops?  No, not even.  10 miles from here.  You have the opportunity to be part of the magic.  I will watch from my house.  Oh, my God, go.  Once in a lifetime.  Why wouldn't you go see your team?  They guarantee they're going to win the Orioles.  They're definitely winning.  Yeah, CeCe...  You guys need to shut up.  CeCe's a little tired.  CeCe's tired.  What was louder?  Was it you cheering for the win?  Or was it your wife's sigh of relief that you weren't going to throw things at her? 
[00:05:30]  I told you, there was no throwing.  And did Lil Riley say something like,  Oh, goody, daddy, no-beam, bad man.  Oh, da-da, bogo, bogo, da-da.  She's not retarded.  I love that.  Da-da, good, bogo, good, bogo.  Jim thinks until you're 10, you just talk.  Right, you just talk like a baby.  There's no concept of kids yet. 
[00:06:00]  I'm holding out hope.  Oh, God.  So, we go game five today.  Well, how are you feeling about the whole thing there, Travis?  What do you think of their chances?  It can go either way.  I think they've got a great chance.  I think the Yankees have a great chance, too.  Yeah.  They can go either way.  One game, there it's it.  That's a little wishy-washy.  It's not wishy-washy.  That's wishy-washy.  These two teams are so even.  Watch.  They really are very evenly matched.  They've played...  They split the season series nine games apiece.  Now they've split this two games apiece. 
[00:06:30]  With very close games.  Each game, aside from game one, was one run.  I understand all that, but you can't be wishy-washy as a fan.  You've got to go, my Orioles are obviously the better team.  Ask me about my Jets.  I'm so paranoid about saying that.  No one wants Opie to say anything about a team.  What do you think about your Jets?  I truly believe this is the year they're going to win the Super Bowl.  That's how you do that, Travis.  That's how you do it.  Orioles are going to the series!  You can't be wishy-washy.  Yeah.  I'm not wishy-washy.  There might be some weird energy in the cosmos that you're fucking up. 
[00:07:00]  That's right.  The butterfly theory.  Your negativity.  The butterfly theory.  Your negativity could hit those little butterfly wings.  Flap over and knock an Oriole hat over.  What is it?  The butterflies cause hurricanes or something?  How does that go again?  Their wing stirs up a little bit of the dust in Africa.  Yeah.  And that little bit of dust goes over the water and starts swirling a little bit and creates  a low-pressure area which moves across the Atlantic into the Caribbean where it is magnified 
[00:07:30]  by warm weather and warm water.  What a dumb concept.  It really is.  Well, no, but they actually say a weather thing happens and say a hurricane happens  and exactly one billion things have to happen for a hurricane to happen, molecular.  Yeah.  If one of those things didn't happen, it wouldn't be...  Right.  So they're saying the butterfly wing may be the thing that could move the...  I just did the butterfly wing.  You really did.  It was an amazing butterfly wing.  That might be able to make that last bit.  That last bit of energy needed.  So what is all the farting cause?  We're all farting our asses off. 
[00:08:00]  But what does that cause?  Earthquakes?  Methane?  Quiet TV watching experiences for men.  Fucking get the broads out when you gas under the afghan.  And here you go, whore.  Lick my balls from it.  Bonds really don't like farts.  Nah, they're the worst.  They get really mad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That debate was fun, man.  That debate was fun.  I'm just going to Biden the shit out of everybody today. 
[00:08:30]  Who won the debate?  Well, I personally think Biden won, but I think that they both walk away knowing they did well.  Fucking pussy.  He's laughing at you.  That's the way that Biden laughs.  That's what I think.  Yeah.  But, I mean, it wasn't like, you know, it wasn't like Obama where Obama got his ass kicked.  And that's why.  Maybe you gave it to Biden by, you know, a little bit.  That's why Biden looked better than he really did, because everybody was weighing it against Obama's horrid appearance. 
[00:09:00]  But Biden looked.  Is this the Fox News spin, sir?  Is this the Fox News spin?  Exactly.  I get my info from Chris Matthews.  Hey.  Hey.  Biden did good.  Oh, my God.  It was an amazing display from Joe Biden.  Someone got a hairbrush?  I'm insane.  Well, I wasn't sure I wanted to watch the debate.  Yeah.  For real, because the Yankees are on.  There was some good TV.  And that opening statement, when Paul Ryan is talking, and Biden has that shit-eating smile, I'm like, I am so in. 
[00:09:30]  He just started smiling and laughing.  I am so in.  During the whole thing.  You watch it, Jimmy?  I was working.  It was fucking great.  Biden is just one of those old-school politicians.  We're going to miss those guys, because there's not many guys like that anymore.  Just a guy you kind of want to drink with.  I think Ryan came off, again, very, like, it was like Romney. 
[00:10:00]  He came off very informed.  He, I don't think Biden ever got a leg up on him with the issues.  I don't know.  I was just too busy watching him smile and laugh and call him my friend over here.  My friend over here.  No one wants to be called my friend.  When he talked about how Biden, like, you know, Biden ought to give people the benefit of the doubt about what comes out of their mouths.  Right.  Because Biden's always making gaffes and shit.  Right.  And Ryan called him out on it.  That was pretty fucking funny. 
[00:10:30]  I mean, he got a laugh out of the crowd.  Yeah, but then Biden used the word malarkey, so come on.  Malarkey.  That was great.  We're good right here.  A bunch of malarkey.  That sounds old-man-ish.  Oh, it certainly does.  It really sounds old-man-ish.  Anthony clearly doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about.  All right, look.  Look.  Well, it's true.  Well, I mean, Anthony sees these things with blinders.  We all know that.  Look.  We all know that.  He can't accept that.  I assume.  That Biden might have got the edge there last night.  I don't see it that way.  I honestly don't see it that.  Sean Hannity certainly doesn't see it that way either. 
[00:11:00]  That Biden got the edge.  I think Biden won the debate.  And is paid by Hannity?  Yes.  Wow.  How do I do?  I'd love to get some money from Hannity.  To repeat what he says?  Yep.  That's exactly it.  Wow.  Is that what happens?  We've been saying that for years.  True.  I'm on red-eye tonight, by the way.  Oh, of course you are.  See?  Of course you are.  That's why you got to say these things.  I'm a shill for the faux news network, man.  Faux news!  Shut up.  I fucking hated that they all shook hands and shit at the end.  I fucking hate that. 
[00:11:30]  That's what they do.  That's what they do.  They got the whole country hating each other, and then they're like, hey, how's the family,  by the way?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Yeah, they have a little talk.  It's like the...  Democrats and Republicans hate each other right now, but those two, what's going on?  You want to get dinner now?  Coyote and the Sheepdog from the cartoon.  All right, Sam.  See you tomorrow, Sam.  And they punch out after killing each other the entire cartoon.  They punch out and go home and walk together with their little lunch pails into the sunset.  Yeah. 
[00:12:00]  It was fun to watch.  It was at least entertaining.  Yeah.  We got some clips.  You want to play a clip or two?  Sure.  I would like to.  I've not seen it or heard it.  Sure.  But I've thought about it.  Biden's smile was just...  It was ridiculous.  It was great, man.  He just kept laughing at everything that Ryan said, and it...  And Ryan was getting so pissed off because he doesn't know how to handle that.  No, I think he did a great job because he plowed right through.  A lot of times Biden was trying to interrupt, much like Romney did to Obama. 
[00:12:30]  Interrupt.  But it came off.  When Romney did it to Obama, it came off natural.  And when Biden did it, it looked like he was just trying to interrupt Ryan's frame, his thought process.  Because what it came off as was a guy that's just trying his hardest.  But Ryan plowed right through and got his points out there and didn't let Biden interrupt him. 
[00:13:00]  He really didn't.  You're going to be on Fox News today, huh?  Yes, I will be on Red Eye.  Are you spinning?  I'm not spinning, my friend.  Are we broadcasting from a carousel right now?  What points?  How about the point that Ryan made about the lack of security in Benghazi and the fact that the White House was asked for more security and didn't supply it?  And how Biden had no answer for that one. 
[00:13:30]  Did he have an answer?  Yeah.  What?  He called it an oopsie.  An oopsie.  He said, we had a little oopsie and that'll never happen again.  And when the question was posed to Biden, Biden said they weren't asked.  Bullshit!  Bullshit!  He was asked.  They were asked.  He's the guy in charge.  Fucking Obama's in charge.  And you leave a guy hanging out in the breeze on September 11th in Libya?  You fucking shithead!  Shut up!  But that's exactly what happened.  Repubs cut the budget. 
[00:14:00]  Shut up!  Yeah, but Paul Ryan wants to put more of our troops on the eastern border of Afghanistan.  That's right.  That means more American debts, sir.  Why does he want to do that?  Why don't we just get out of there and let them have the Taliban?  It was a point where he slipped on and I think Biden fucking hammered him on.  No, he was saying.  We'd rather have Afghansans on the eastern border.  That's a dangerous place.  We want less Americans in that area.  It's exactly what he was saying.  And I said, go Joe Biden.  That's why I'm voting for Obama now.  Ryan was saying there, obviously, there's the same frame of thought with the 2014 withdrawal from Afghanistan. 
[00:14:30]  They agree with that.  But they don't agree with the fact that you slowly withdraw troops and leave the guys that are there with less men and resources.  You can't.  So it's not that let's send more guys in and we want more men there.  It's that you don't want to still try to pull off these missions and the job that these guys got to do with less soldiers.  Is that what's happening?  Yes.  And then what Biden was saying was, fuck this Obama, I got to vote for Romney. 
[00:15:00]  What Biden was saying was, you want to replace those soldiers with Afghani soldiers so that it's not these just a few Americans out in the breeze.  But the way it's working, you're getting Afghanis that are shooting the fucking American soldiers.  You know what?  So I agree.  Pull those fucking guys out.  You just educated me on the whole situation.  I rule.  We have a weak foreign policy.  I got to vote for fucking Romney.  It's got to happen.  It's Ron Paul, man.  Yep.  Oh, man.  I like that Ron Paul guy. 
[00:15:30]  Or Gary Johnson.  You know, I'm starting to read about this Gary Johnson because there's one asshole on Twitter that is obsessing about it.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, you could call me Gary Johnson.  You could call me Ray J. Johnson.  But she doesn't have to put me on the ballot.  These clips are very long.  I think everyone saw the debate, Sam.  I didn't, though.  I want to hear it.  I mean, moment by moment.  I want to talk about the diamond planet.  You're going a million miles a second right now.  Yeah.  The diamond planet is 40 light years from here. 
[00:16:00]  We're never going.  I promised.  I was just trying to shut you up.  We're not going.  I just told Ant, though, how cool is it that they found a diamond planet?  That's great.  A diamond planet.  And then Ant goes, let's go get that thing.  I'm like, no.  Supply and demand.  You get the diamond planet, diamonds will be now worthless.  Giant planet of diamonds?  You can't go and get the diamond planet.  You've got to leave it alone.  No.  Our poor single sponsor that we love, poor Steven Singer.  If you brought the diamond planet here, he'd be out of business.  He'd be fucking out of business.  Yeah.  But how long until Steven Singer has mini diamond planets for sale? 
[00:16:30]  Mini diamond planets.  Ah, this Mother's Day.  The diamond planets.  A chunk of the diamond planet.  It's Steven Singer located on the other side of the galaxy.  Steven Singer diamond planet jewelers.  But you know he'll exploit this thing.  Of course he will.  Why wait for us to go get the diamond planet?  We've got diamonds right here on Earth.  And of course, make sure you get the genuine gold-dipped asteroids.  Which will be available.  Yes.  For Mother's Day. 
[00:17:00]  For Mother's Day.  Being on the diamond planet would suck, though.  You just go, I'd like you to be my wife.  And then you take her hand and you just slam it on the surface of the ground.  Now, where the planet, bitch?  I bet you on the diamond planet, dog shit is considered the ring of choice.  Or something horrible.  I bet you it would be really hard to walk on the diamond planet.  Yes.  3,900.  3,900 foot.  3,900 degrees.  Your foot.  Huh?  3,900 degrees.  Is that good?  Well, if you have some, you need some motherfucking good shoes.  Just make sure you visit the website, IHateTheIcyColdDeadlyVacuumOfSpace.com. 
[00:17:30]  Well, you know, guys, it's twice the size of the Earth, and it rotates around its sun in 18 hours,  as opposed to the Earth, which does it once a year.  That's quite zippity-doo-dah-daying around the neighborhood.  It certainly is.  How do you sleep when it's 18 hours?  Everyone must be vomiting on the diamond planet.  I'm sick.  I know.  I think we'd be used to this, but we're not.  You think the diamond planet is really heavy?  Oh, man.  I think that's fucking heavy shit.  That's a heavy-ass planet. 
[00:18:00]  You think?  Yeah.  This is not the first diamond planet ever discovered,  but it is the first one to have its chemical makeup specified in the first scene orbiting a sun-like star.  How fucking cool is this?  It's pretty goddamn cool.  Does it look like an ice planet from afar?  Like Hoth?  Yeah.  Like the ice planet of Hoth?  Hmm.  All right.  So we got some debate audio.  Debate.  Yeah.  You're going to realize that Biden just kicked Ryan's ass. 
[00:18:30]  I don't see it that way.  Well.  I don't see it that way.  I selectively picked a few clips.  Oh, God.  See?  That proves my point.  MSNBC?  Hey!  Just playing the fucking clips.  It's amazing.  And yeah, it does sound like Brian Regan because he sounds like Brian Regan.  Yeah, that's the whole bit, you idiots.  But he's more like Crazy Guy.  Right.  You know, this is Mount Rushmore.  These are where they put the president's heads up.  And it's amazing.  These are people that want to help other people.  He's more of, he's a manic Brian Regan.  Doing their fair share and paying their taxes. 
[00:19:00]  Holy shit!  Someone get me some hairspray.  I look like a stark raving lunatic.  He's got passionate.  Yeah.  And he loves the Kennedys this Christmas.  Oh, does he love the Kennedys?  But I don't know much about politics.  This is just stuff I pick up along the way.  An obvious win for Joe Biden!  But then they were nice.  Look, handshakes.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, as I watch the debate, I think to myself, how long I would last in that situation? 
[00:19:30]  I would be so strangling Joe Biden if I was Paul Ryan.  I know where my limit is.  And I'm like, there's no way I'd be able to sit through this.  Just belt him.  Yes.  And I thought the final statement went to Ryan.  Well, that's because he got to go last.  We all know that.  But if you get to go last, you win that point always.  It was a lot more concise than Biden's was.  A lot more thought out.  And he addressed the camera very well. 
[00:20:00]  Whereas Biden kind of, like you said, Biden's that old school guy.  But he comes off.  That whole thing looks very curmudgeonly these days.  I don't feel like he looks like a curmudgeon, though.  Really?  He's an old politician.  Well, malarkey doesn't help my fucking case here.  Yeah, yeah.  When is Paul Ryan going to tape his ears back, though?  Like you do with dogs.  Oh.  He's got big ears.  He's got Eddie Munster hair, too.  What are you going to do?  I know.  I thought I was the first one to point that out on Twitter.  And then I awkwardly saw that.  What are you going to do, man? 
[00:20:30]  Everyone else pointed it out.  What are you going to do, man?  A nigga got an ear problem.  Nothing worse when you, like, tweet something that you think is brilliant and then you realize,  oh, I'm the 10,000th person to fucking tweet that observation.  I usually get those.  Hey, Anthony!  Bloody, bloody, bloody.  Oh, okay.  Bloody, bloody, blah.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll put it in the pile of bloody, bloody, blah tweets I got.  Fucking everybody's amazing.  They're the first ones to show me stuff.  I love them all.  Oh, of course you do.  Here's Biden and Paul Ryan debating on the unemployment rate. 
[00:21:00]  Joe and I are from similar towns.  He's from Scranton, Pennsylvania.  I'm from Jamesville, Wisconsin.  Oh.  You know what the unemployment rate in Scranton is today?  I sure do.  It's 10%.  Yeah.  You know what it was the day you guys came in?  8.5%.  Zinger!  Aw, shit.  Zinger!  You know what Joe should have said there?  Joe should have said, yeah, but that's because the Jews took the jobs.  Said something outrageous and blamed one group.  But it also shows you that politics, it's all bullshit because you've got one of the 
[00:21:30]  main guys.  He's the vice president of the United States of America.  He's from Scranton.  I've been to Scranton.  It's a shithole.  Right.  And he can't fucking make his own hometown better.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's all you need to know.  Yeah.  You think if you were in the White House or that close to being the president that you  can maybe get a few little things done for your own hometown.  But it's all bullshit.  It really is.  5%.  It really is.  That's how it's going all around America. 
[00:22:00]  Look.  You don't read the statistic.  That's not how it's going.  It's going down.  It's just a two minute answer.  Look.  Shut up, Martha.  Did they come in and inherit a tough situation?  Absolutely.  But we're going in the wrong direction.  Another thing I hate about debates.  These guys are about to get into it, right?  And then you've got the dumb moderator that feels like, oh, well, I've got to be part of  I've got to do this or else they're going to yell at me like they did with, uh, when they  stop them.  It's like, shut up.  Who gives the fuck you have another question that you want to get to?  Guess what?  Every day we have a lot of material. 
[00:22:30]  And if something's working, we blow off everything.  And as a moderator, you should just let these guys go.  And if that means only one question was asked, so be it.  Let these guys go.  Yeah.  I think they're afraid, though, that they'll interrupt with these guys are masters at  deflecting and bullshit.  And like, if you're making a point, the other guy will jump in and just fucking filibuster  and give all just words that mean absolutely nothing.  I guess it's hard to be a moderator.  You might be right.  But I just love when they finally start getting into it, you know? 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, on an emotional level, I like it, too, because you can tell they don't like each  other.  Right.  Hmm.  What happened there?  Anything good?  Uh, well, uh, talking about unemployment.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think, uh, some points were made as far as, um, uh, the unemployment.  And I don't know.  I don't see as how one month before the election, the numbers, uh, go down.  Uh, I'm not going to get into any conspiracy theories on that one, which are being, uh, 
[00:23:30]  ballied about.  That means you're going to get into it.  No, I'm not.  I'm actually not.  Because now I need to know.  I'm actually not.  And that's fine and well.  But you can't, we know this as far as, because we've dealt with ratings for years and years  and years.  You can't take one month and, and decide that's the, now the trend that is going to continue  happening.  You do get anomalies in numbers.  Uh, but when you take the fact that, that 40 some odd months go by, you know, you get,  you get a long time going by, uh, with, with a certain trend in unemployment, then your 
[00:24:00]  numbers come in and you're banking on them.  Like that's the trend.  You can't do that.  So you can't say that we're moving in the right direction.  Is it optimistic?  Sure.  It is.  You know, I, I'm sure the country would love seeing these numbers continue.  The numbers could pop right the fuck back up again.  Unless, until you get, uh, a general feeling in the nation that things are getting better,  things aren't getting better.  And there isn't that feeling that there's a light at the end of the tunnel here.  So, uh, when Biden talks about, uh, the, the numbers heading in the right direction and, 
[00:24:30]  um, I, I don't think that's being completely honest.  And I think that's what they were getting at, uh, as far as the, the, some of these numbers  go.  Yeah.  Romney's our guy.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Until the next clip.  No, no.  I think I could stick with this one.  Oh, sure.  I really think I can.  Uh, Biden talks about loopholes being, taking advantage of.  I don't know this clip. 
[00:25:00]  Tax loopholes.  It's just more of, uh, Biden interrupting him and making funny comments.  Funny comments.  I was laughing.  Yeah, Biden.  This is a good debate.  This is one big cartoon for me.  I just, it's just fun for me.  Biden kicked his ass.  He totally won.  Hey.  Wow, Sam.  Sam.  Wow, Sam showing, uh, his politics finally on the show.  Just stick to making people cry.  Yeah, you loopholes.  Fucking guy.  Yeah.  Do you really think so?  Yeah.  I mean, Mitt Romney destroyed Obama in the last one.  Yeah, I, I had no, yeah, I think, yeah, I think Romney kicked Obama's ass and I really 
[00:25:30]  did.  Because I really think, it was obvious he did.  I really think Biden beat, uh, Ryan.  Not as bad as Romney beating Obama.  I don't see it that way.  Obama did terribly in the debate.  Paul Ryan didn't do terribly, but Joe Biden just, he alpha mailed him.  No, he didn't.  He was totally, yeah.  Oh, he so did.  From that clip, you couldn't hear it though, from that clip, I mean, that was only one  clip, but that last clip didn't sound like a bad moment.  Ryan probably made more legit points, maybe.  Right.  And had more information.  So you were entertained more by the goofy Joe Biden. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, yeah.  Then.  But that's how people vote.  Then you take away from, with the issues and you come away with the issues being discussed.  But no one votes on issues.  The goofy smile, the wacky interrupting, uh, that, that kind of thing.  Like, if there was a Biden-Romney ticket, I'd be wearing shirts.  I'd be like, yeah, this guy, this is awesome.  What you're just saying is you want, you want the color removed from the election.  I understand.  Sam wants an all-white ticket.  It doesn't matter who's running.  He's like, you know, take, take the you know what out and I'm voting. 
[00:26:30]  I hear you.  Fucking Jason Wirth is a hero today, huh?  Wow.  Fuck.  When's the series or a home run?  Did you see that game at all?  You're not watching the Nats?  No, no, I'm really not paying attention to the Natitude.  Not a fan of the Natitude.  No, no, no.  That's too bad.  No, no, no.  Jason Wirth, who used to play for the Phillies.  There it is.  Goodbye.  Why were they sitting at the vice presidential debate?  I don't, I, I don't know.  They liked doing that. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, it was a seated format.  I think they did that for Cheney because they realized, you know, if Cheney stood for too long, his heart would give out.  So I think it started with him and they just decided to keep it going.  That's my just dumb thought on it.  Biden did exactly what Romney did, just better and against a lesser opponent.  I've heard that.  Are you out of your mind better than Romney?  Romney made the president look like an idiot.  Shut it.  Romney did do a great job.  And Biden did not fucking make, uh, uh, make Ryan look like an idiot.  How bad do you think Biden wanted to, if he had a microphone, throw it down and go, Obama, that's how it's done. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  Do you understand that if Biden had alpha male and done what, what, uh, Romney did to Obama, that every news organization would be crowing to the umpteenth level about, oh my God, finally.  Oh, they made up all that lost ground with, with Obama's debate.  It was amazing.  The spanking that Ryan took last night.  Astounding.  Someone get me some hairspray.  There he is right now. 
[00:28:00]  Hold on.  It's not always fought on a battlefield.  Yeah.  It's fought in Congress.  This is Tom Chris Matthews.  It's fought in our presidential campaigns.  Oh, he's in a park dance.  It's really a battle between those who want to extend freedom.  Between those.  And opportunity.  And rights.  Nice.  And those who want to restrict them.  It's taken a long time.  It's been a brutal struggle for women's rights, for African American rights.  Shut up.  For gay rights.  But in the end, the people who fight to enlarge our liberty tend to win the argument.  Lean forward.  Lean forward.  Take it in the ass.  MSNBC really does stink. 
[00:28:30]  It's so blatantly biased.  It's not even fucking.  So's Fox.  They don't even attempt to.  Yeah, Fox.  Okay, that's one right-leaning news station.  CNN's not bad.  And every other fucking one is left.  CNN, I feel comfortable watching.  Oh, boy.  I don't feel comfortable watching either MSNBC or Fox, although I'd take a peek at both.  I feel more comfortable watching CNN.  They're not as bad, I feel.  Which way do they lean, CNN?  I'm not even joking right now. 
[00:29:00]  I think they're left.  CNN is left.  But not nearly as left.  Not as heavy as MSNBC.  Okay, okay.  But that's what MSNBC does, is they make the other ones look much more centered because  they're so obvious and so blatant.  It's almost like they're not doing well in the ratings.  Why else do you give a piece of shit like Al Sharpton a job?  Exactly.  It's almost a way to make the other ones look centered.  Well, I certainly don't like him at all. 
[00:29:30]  But there's a new guy I don't like.  The male version of, what's her name?  Who's the...  Oh, Rachel Maddow.  Yeah, yeah.  The male version.  Yeah.  With the glasses, is that right?  Chris Hayes, I think his name is.  Oh, I can't stand him.  I want to take his glasses off and break them so bad.  I just want to step on his glasses.  He's on on the weekends.  He drives me nuts.  He said something recently that really hit the backtrack on, didn't he?  Was it on September 11th?  Yeah. 
[00:30:00]  Was that the one?  He is...  He's horrible.  The good thing is, no one's watching MSNBC.  But they're trying to make him the next, you know, Rachel Maddow.  You watch.  Don't move him up.  You think?  Oh, fuck yeah.  They're grooming him.  We got this morning Joe on, on MSNBC every morning.  Do you realize that if we turned it off, they'd lose half their fucking ratings?  There's no...  No, I was looking at the ratings for all these news programs, and they're consistently absolute  last place, beaten by everything, Colbert, The Daily Show, which are put in the news 
[00:30:30]  ratings, and they consistently beat him on Comedy Central.  In the morning or no?  No overall numbers, yeah.  Just overall...  Just the channel's overall numbers.  The channel's overall number at the time.  Colbert and Jon Stewart, they're just monsters.  They're fucking great.  They're fucking monsters.  But again, Fox beats all them, like all the Fox shows, Hannity, O'Reilly, they beat all  of them, and usually combined.  It's just an amazing fucking juggernaut. 
[00:31:00]  Hannity, yeah.  Hannity beats everybody.  O'Reilly beats Hannity, though, right?  Yeah.  I think O'Reilly's the best.  O'Reilly's like the big man on campus.  Well, let's learn...  Piers is just doing awful.  Is he really?  Yeah.  He's terrible.  Piers.  I don't like Piers.  He gets his moments.  I really don't like Piers.  Yeah, it's not a Larry King vibe on that.  No, I don't know what it is about him.  I just don't...  I don't like him.  Don't you hate when fucking people from England start commenting on American shit?  Maybe that's what it is. 
[00:31:30]  When Piers starts getting all pissy about our politics and gun control and things like  that, it's like, shut up, you fucking limey cocksucker.  Take your ass back over the pond, you shitheel.  We had him on the show, though.  I really liked him.  Oh, he's a nice enough guy.  I liked him.  But fuck him in the ass.  And his appearance on our show, but I tried watching.  I just...  I don't know.  I can't get into him.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't think he's as far left as I thought he was.  Like, he makes...  Like, he goes up against Ventura.  He made him look like a dummy.  Like, he's not...  He's brave.  I like that about him. 
[00:32:00]  He's not a crazy guy.  He's not fucking irrational.  No.  He's just ultra left.  He doesn't back down.  But his features seem like they've been erased or something.  Like, he has no features.  It's weird.  He doesn't have a lot of facial definition.  No, it's really strange.  Yeah, it's just a typical bland British face.  He still looks like a grown-up Caillou for the parents out there.  That's parent humor.  What's a Caillou?  That's a fucking show my kid insists on watching over and over and over again.  Caillou sucks.  He doesn't just want to watch it once? 
[00:32:30]  No.  Caillou's a wimp.  I don't want Caillou to be a role model for my son.  I hate Caillou.  It's a good program.  Caillou.  Caillou.  Caillou.  Anyway.  You want to do more of the debate?  Want to learn about loopholes?  Let's learn about loopholes and the blatant dishonesty that is being put out there of Joe Biden.  Paul Ryan, right?  Joe Biden.  You bet if Paul Ryan was my dad, I'd be like, oh. 
[00:33:00]  He probably could be.  Boy.  No, what was pretty funny is I guess one of the news shows had Paul Ryan's niece and nephew  on because they hit the stage after the debates and stuff.  And to just hear the little kids talking about Uncle Paul.  Hilarious.  So what did you think about Uncle Paul?  Oh, he did great.  Do we have that clip?  Sure.  Is it worth playing?  It was on...  That's funny.  I forgot what show it was on.  All right.  Let's listen to this. 
[00:33:30]  The loophole, the biggest loophole they take advantage of is the carried interest loophole  and capital gains loophole.  They exempt that.  Now, there's not enough.  The reason why the AEI study, the American Enterprise Institute study, the Tax Policy Center  study, the reason they all say it's going to taxers who grew up in the middle class,  the only way you can find $5 trillion in loopholes is cut the mortgage deduction for middle class  people, cut the health care deduction for middle class people.  This is where they lose everybody, by the way.  Wait a minute.  This is the stuff where they start losing everybody. 
[00:34:00]  Where's the zingers?  Did he say, uh...  Whatever he said, it was brilliant.  No.  I don't want to hear anything different.  He smoked him.  He smoked him out there on the debate floor.  Jesus Christ, where's some hair gel?  Oh, he's talking about the capital gains tax.  Capital gains, like, why should you be taxed on money you've already paid taxes on?  Like, haven't you paid taxes on that money already?  Of course, yeah.  Capital gains tax, like, you make money, you invest it, and then if it does well, you have  to continue paying taxes on it. 
[00:34:30]  It's like, it should be a lower rate.  It should be a very low rate at that point.  It's disgusting.  And it's going to pretty much take people out of investing in the country and investing  in business.  And how about the fact that after January 1st, the death tax for, obviously, people with  assets.  Now, I'm going to bring out a big number here, so calm down, so everybody can say, well,  that's not me, so fuck you.  A million dollars, your assets. 
[00:35:00]  Now, I'm not talking about what you make in a year.  I'm talking about everything you've acquired over your lifetime.  It's easy these days with a house and real estate, your personal possessions, everything  you've collected over your life, to have assets of a million dollars or more.  A lot of people actually have that.  You're going to be taxed at your death at a 50% tax rate.  It's disgusting.  50 fucking percent.  The government will take half your shit off the top.  Which guy's doing this?  Hey, welcome to the fucking...  Which guy's doing this? 
[00:35:30]  Who do you think?  Of course it's Obama.  Who do you think?  That's fucking sickening.  Yes, exactly.  They can't keep their fucking hands out of your pocket.  Anth is really out of touch with normal income.  Why don't you fuck your mother?  Huh?  No, no.  Don't be nice to him.  Yeah, I know.  I was trying to give him a compliment.  We all like to do that.  Yeah.  You are...  No, I'm not.  But even if that is a high amount, who cares?  Who the fuck's business of the government to come in and take what you've earned so you  can't give it to your family? 
[00:36:00]  Exactly.  What, do they want to give it to Egypt?  They want to give half that fucking money to Egypt?  Yeah, how about no?  And the second you use a word like capital gains, that is rich people talk.  Oh, I get it.  Rich people talk.  Oh.  Not really.  No.  That trickles right down to your own bank account.  It goes down to your own fucking retirement plans.  Look what they do with your bank account.  They even take...  You make a little interest and they'd have to tax that, too.  My brother used to work on Wall Street.  I think a bunch of people know that. 
[00:36:30]  And he bailed a few years ago with all the merging and whatnot.  He finally left and he day trades and he does all right for himself.  So, I asked him, are you ever going to go back to Wall Street?  He goes, those guys don't even come close to making what they used to.  They're already getting fucking...  I'm ready to just shut down Pal Talk.  Why?  And, sorry, two wars under...  Bush left the country in debt.  Time for all of us to pay more taxes.  Hey, motherfucker, what about the people not paying any taxes? 
[00:37:00]  Shut up about...  Shut up!  I'm paying my fucking share.  Do you want half my money, you cunt?  Two wars on a credit card.  On a credit card.  There's your zinger.  Well, I mean, that's not even a bad point.  That is because...  Everybody wanted war.  Everyone wanted the war.  Shut up.  But I don't want to pay more tax.  No.  I want the money we give to be used better.  Right.  I'm sick and tired of them taking more.  I pay enough.  I just got a fucking tax bill because I did better last year than I thought.  But I owe a lot more fucking money.  And I had to pay it. 
[00:37:30]  You don't have to raise fucking taxes.  Like Romney was saying, you asshole, the fact that you increase jobs, more people that  are working.  I'd rather have ten people having to be taxed a dollar than two people tax five bucks each,  you dumb motherfucker.  Well...  Oh, God.  Tax, tax, tax.  You Democrats are shitheads.  Just keep the economy rolling along at this amazing rate that it's recovering. 
[00:38:00]  And about inheriting shit, they knew what they were getting into.  It wasn't fucking let's make a deal where a curtain opened up and you go, wah, wah.  A shitty economy.  Wah, wah, wah.  They knew what they were stepping into and they promised to fix it four years ago.  Well, they fucking bullshitted everyone.  And now they want another four?  Blow me.  So you're voting for...  I'm on a red eye tonight.  The faux news network, by the way. 
[00:38:30]  Please tune in.  That's why we need a revolution.  Dude, we need just a third party.  We need a revolution.  A bloody revolution.  Occupy Wall Street makes a lot of sense.  That faggot revolution is what it is.  You can't have a revolution where people that get zip strip handcuffs put on start crying  about police brutality.  They did deserve that money in the lawsuit, though, the million dollars they got or whatever  it was.  My God.  You kind of did, right, Jimmy?  Yeah.  I think you're all playing camp with me.  Honestly, I think you're trying to get on me. 
[00:39:00]  You're all playing camp.  Can we play some clips from the Barbra Streisand concert?  It'll make you happy again.  Oh, no.  She never talks in between songs.  Did you hear the sound bites from the two guys from England?  No.  Woo!  Woo!  Wow.  It was on 1010 Winds if the boys want to try to find it.  Wow.  Wow.  They were wearing blue for their blue eyes just in case they meet Barbra Streisand.  Oh, boy.  Wow. 
[00:39:30]  Here's more on the loopholes.  People, cut the health care deduction.  Middle class people, take away their ability to get a tax break to send their kids to college.  That's why they arrived.  Is he wrong about that?  He is wrong about that.  Oh, how's that?  You can cut tax rates by 20%.  He goes, how's that?  How's that?  How's that?  Why don't you fucking enlighten me, you little shithead?  Right.  How's that?  What a brilliant thing to say!  You can cut tax rates by 20% and still preserve these important preferences for middle class taxpayers. 
[00:40:00]  Not mathematically possible.  It is mathematically possible.  It's been done before.  It's precisely what we're proposing.  It has never been done before.  It's been done a couple of times.  It has never.  This right here is what, this is why they can't let them interrupt.  Because they're just going to go, it has been done.  It hasn't been done.  Nah, no, no, it has.  It hasn't.  How about a fucking number from either one of you?  Who did it and when and how?  But it's great to hear that.  Hello, I'd like to have an argument.  No, you won't.  Yes, I will.  No, you won't.  I love it. 
[00:40:30]  Sorry.  No, no.  Who's right now?  It's been done a couple of times, actually.  It has never been done before.  Jack Kennedy lowered tax rates, increased growth.  Ronald Reagan.  Oh, now you're Jack Kennedy.  Ronald Reagan.  Biden was going for that moment.  He was trying.  He was going, you sir are no Jack Kennedy.  Right.  Yeah.  Oh, now you're Jack Kennedy.  He didn't say he's Jack Kennedy.  Jesus.  No, it's great about the close.  No, it's great about the VP debate.  They play all the clips from the past with Stockdale.  Yeah.  Who am I?  Why am I here? 
[00:41:00]  Why am I here?  And then it was time for closing statements and they played the clip where he goes, well,  I just ran out of gas or something like that.  Greatest debate ever.  Can we get some Stockdale clips today, Sam?  Yes.  Way, way more interesting than this crap.  But that Ryan made a good point there and fucking Biden just said, oh, now you're Kennedy.  But that's not a legit answer to what Ryan said.  It wasn't one of those statements where it's like you're saying something to make yourself  sound Kennedy-like.  No, he's just, he's, yeah. 
[00:41:30]  He said, when has it been done?  And he goes, well, Jack Kennedy and Reagan.  Oh, now you're calling yourself Kennedy.  I know.  But that was Biden.  So I'll give him that.  Biden was trying a little too hard.  Biden was trying to be the pit bull to protect his president.  That was his total job last night.  He was obviously successful.  Is why he was doing it.  But it came off, obviously, trying to do that.  That's how I saw it.  Republicans and Democrats, Republicans and Democrats have worked together on this.  You know, I understand you guys aren't used to doing bipartisan deals. 
[00:42:00]  But we've told each other what we're going to do.  When we did it with Reagan, he said, here are the things we're going to cut.  We said, here's the framework.  Let's work together to fill in the details.  That's exactly.  Fill in the details.  That's how you get things done.  You work with Congress.  Look, let me say it this way.  That's coming from the Republican Congress working bipartisan.  I'm going to say right now, Biden is fucking irritating me.  That's what a lot of people said.  He's just irritating.  The legislators he served with were Democrats.  He didn't demonize them.  He didn't demagogue them.  He met with those party leaders every week.  He reached across the aisle. 
[00:42:30]  He didn't compromise principles.  And he found common ground.  And he balanced the budget.  If he did such a great job in Massachusetts, why isn't he even contesting Massachusetts?  He's just babbling over fucking...  He saw what Romney did to Obama.  And the way Romney did it was a lot more effective.  It seemed a lot more natural than what Biden is trying to do here is just strong arm Ryan 
[00:43:00]  and trying to interrupt his chain of thought, his words.  And it came off like that.  It came off very forceful.  Those clips I found Biden to be really fucking irritating.  But you have to watch the whole thing.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm sure you do.  But that was annoying.  Just Joe interrupting.  It's like, shut the fuck up.  He made a good point.  He interrupted him a lot.  He did, right?  Yeah.  We can play more debate clips a little later.  I was telling that before the show, all you need to know about America is, you know,  you watch Twitter, and when the debate started, everyone's like fucking all about it. 
[00:43:30]  All the trending topics were, you know, Joe Biden, Paul Ryan, VP debate, you know, all  that shit, right?  And then all of a sudden, this fucking video popped up.  Yeah.  The latest viral video.  And everyone said, well, fuck the debate.  Yeah.  And went to this video.  And then every, not every, but half the trending topics in the country were about this video.  About the video.  And that's all you need to know about America.  How that's it for us.  That was the...  We can pay attention for...  Right, right. 
[00:44:00]  For so long.  And then something else gets our attention immediately.  You know what Joe Biden was doing during the debate?  It was quite amazing how he handled Ryan.  And, well, look at the color to hit the other one on the bus.  That's amazing.  That's America right there.  Anyway, I'm sure most have seen this.  We got to get this on our Facebook page.  Bitch, get off my bus.  Driver uppercuts the shit out of a teen...  That's a teen girl.  Apparently.  Teen girl in Cleveland.  So you got, you know, a public bus there.  And you got this teen girl really acting up for whatever reason. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, she is in this guy's face.  In this bus driver's face.  Pushing on him.  Just lambasting about something.  I don't even know what.  And this is interesting because a lot of women will act like this.  Knowing that guys will not hit girls.  Yeah.  We've all been brought up to and taught you don't hit a girl.  Yep.  And that's why I think a lot of women will act out.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  To this point.  Because they just know.  They get...  They're not going to get hit. 
[00:45:00]  Well, not in this case.  The bus driver took care of business.  Wait till you see this punch, Jimmy.  It is so hard.  So the bus is moving, too.  And she's arguing with the bus driver.  Okay, well, bring him, nigga.  Bring your manny up here, bitch.  Bring your manny up here, bitch.  Oh, shit.  Nigga, I'll go up that home for me.  You look like somebody that sliced your face up. 
[00:45:30]  Your face up.  So she pushes the bus driver while they're driving.  He stops the bus.  Stands up.  Pause.  Uppercuts the shit out of her.  That is such a fucking punch.  And throws her off the bus.  And her shit.  He came like...  You know when you go bowling and you're ready to leave  so you don't care about where the ball goes,  but you just want to see if you can throw it as hard as you can?  You walk up and you bring that bowling ball 
[00:46:00]  way up behind your head.  That's how he fucking started the punch.  It was way the fuck back.  He came...  Hit her perfectly under the jaw.  You heard that smack.  And she go...  Damn, motherfucker.  And she threw her off the fucking bus.  Then picks her up, throws her out the door.  But she comes back on.  She comes back on.  How is she not knocked out?  I'm amazed she's not knocked out.  There's no one in this studio that could take that punch  that that guy just threw.  Unbelievable.  She pushes him as the bus is moving.  And then that's when he stopped the bus. 
[00:46:30]  I think you heard it on the clip.  And goes,  Will, you're going to hell now.  Yeah.  Because she pushed him.  There's a guy standing in front of the camera.  So you block out a little bit of what happened.  She obviously lunges in.  She might have pushed him in the face.  I mean, she might have clawed him.  I don't know exactly what she did.  Well, I'll tell you this much.  But she did something that sent him over the edge.  World Star Hip Hop is going to be blowing up today.  World Star Hip Hop, motherfucker.  Again, with portrait mode.  Boy, black people just don't know how to turn that phone.  No one knows how.  They could turn a gun sideways.  But when it comes to a phone. 
[00:47:00]  Dude, nine out of ten.  My phone.  Nine out of ten of these really good viral videos from an iPhone or whatever.  I'll just say iPhone.  Fuck it.  You know, it's like that.  Why?  Yeah.  Turn to your fucking camera.  By the way, that's how you keep your content from getting stolen.  You have that scroll.  It's annoying.  Oh, the World Star Hip Hop logo is all over it.  But they know how to keep their shit from getting stolen.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's right.  Well, you know what?  That's why the Opster is tagging all his videos now.  Without World Star Hip Hop on there, I'd kind of know it was World Star Hip Hop.  Well, yeah.  On this particular clip, you would. 
[00:47:30]  Yes, yes.  Because this is not even listed under violence.  This is listed under couples meeting.  Listed under cute kittens.  Shenanigans.  Another cute kitten video.  Yeah, back up a little bit.  Go back to the punch.  Fuck it.  That's a great shot.  Especially with the guy going, you going to hell now?  Did he say hell or jail?  I thought he said jail.  Oh, you're going to jail now?  I think he said jail.  Oh, all right.  Let's hear that again.  I heard hell.  That smack that that punch makes of just her teeth clacking together when he hit her.  And let me ask the tough question before we play this again. 
[00:48:00]  Does she deserve this?  Tough question.  What did she do to him?  This guy in the orange vest is in the way.  She leaned in while the bus was moving and grabbed him.  Exactly.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But she's carrying on in a way where I know no one's going to touch me because I'm a woman.  In the context of you never hit a woman, obviously you don't do that.  That's why it's a tough question.  But if a guy was doing this, it would be a no-brainer.  There would be a massive fucking fight, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, motherfucker. 
[00:48:30]  If she wants to push him and get in his face, I never would.  I mean, a woman could absolutely fucking just smack me around.  I'm not going to hit her back.  Yeah.  But this guy?  Well, he says something in the clip.  I won't say it now because, you know, whatever.  But he says something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  But see, this guy in the orange vest is blocked.  You don't know what she did.  She leaned in while the bus was moving.  Well, obviously, you know, like most videos, you know, this was filmed halfway through, whatever.  Yeah, so it's out of context.  Because you hear something getting heated. 
[00:49:00]  You're like, all right, what's going on?  Yeah, yeah.  And then you finally turn your camera on.  I don't know what happened before this guy started recording.  Pushes him.  Oh, you're going to jail now.  Okay.  You're going to jail?  Oh.  He stabs him by the hair and throws off the bus dread first.  Throws his shit off the bus.  Oh, listen to that screeching.  Jesus.  And she comes back on the bus. 
[00:49:30]  She's fierce, man.  No, no, no, no, no.  She's probably used to getting hit.  I'm a fucking female.  I bet she's used to getting hit.  She want to be a man?  I'm going to treat you like a man.  You want me to be a man?  Of course.  All right.  There's more things to talk about here.  Yeah, because someone screams out, she's a, you know.  She's female.  Right.  And he goes, you can act like a man.  I'm going to treat you like a man.  I'm going to treat you like a man.  And the one thing I told that before the show, I can never be black.  No, huh?  No, because in that situation, I would be horrified. 
[00:50:00]  Everyone screamed like, oh!  They're all screaming.  They're loving this.  I'd be scared to death if this happened on the bus I was on.  Because you're not used to seeing it.  If you were used to seeing it.  You think they're just used to this crazy shit?  Yes.  And also, compared to gun violence, like, a fist in the face is funny.  That's nothing.  Compared to other shit, this is just a punch.  I'm going to use the word, and I'm going to acknowledge I'm using it.  But how they're howling.  Yeah.  Well, it is.  It's a, you know.  Wouldn't you be like, how the fuck do I get off this bus?  I would be petrified as me. 
[00:50:30]  It's like, just damn.  But if you saw enough fights in person, like, real-life fights on a daily basis, it wouldn't  be as big a deal.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a girl, that's a girl.  That's a girl.  That's a girl.  That's a girl.  That's a girl.  Oh, he's pulling her hair.  You going to jail, bitch?  Yes, I am. 
[00:51:00]  I'm on this.  You going to jail, bitch?  Chill out, chill out.  I need no fuck that.  You going to jail, bitch?  My nigga going to beat the brakes off you, bitch?  I don't know.  I need him in my jail, nigga.  Nigga!  What?  Can someone explain once again?  Does she have a nigga?  She's just a fucking animal, this chick, just screaming and causing...  This reminds me of that pizza parlor video where the fucking chick gets in the guy's face  and she's poking him or whatever.  And the guy, the white guy handled it wrong because he's trying to talk black to her, but 
[00:51:30]  I think he was talking bad about her on the phone and she's in his face and poking  him and she brings that monster boyfriend in.  Yes!  Right.  And then the guy is yelling at the chick in front of the boyfriend and the guy, the boyfriend  just fucking clubbed him and went to jail.  But it's like now she's talking about getting her boyfriend.  And stole her cell phone, by the way.  Of course.  You can't push the guy's face while he's driving the bus and not expect to get hit.  Yeah, she created that situation as far as what we see on the video.  The problem is with the bus driver, he fucking blew it because he gets up going, you're going  to jail now. 
[00:52:00]  All he had to do was stop the bus, call the cops or whatever.  But with that uppercut, he's fucked.  He will absolutely lose his job.  And there will absolutely be criminal charges.  Yeah, that guy's gonna have trouble.  But that's what everyone focused on in the middle of the debate yesterday.  That wasn't a school bus.  That was just a bus, right?  Yeah, I didn't say school bus.  Public.  No, I'm wondering if it was.  Oh, no, no, no.  That's a public bus.  Public bus.  Somewhere in Cleveland?  Yeah, motherfucker.  Was that yesterday that happened?  It just hit yesterday.  I mean, it hit during the debate and everyone just said, fuck the debate. 
[00:52:30]  We gotta check out this video.  That guy threw some Samuel L. Jackson shit at it, too.  Come on, act like a man.  Right.  I'll treat you like a man.  I'd be very interested to know what started.  I'm willing to bet that this guy didn't start it.  Because the bus driver is just picking people up.  Like, what kind of scenario does the bus driver start shit with someone who gets on the bus  and sits quietly?  Right.  All that don't matter.  She was in his face for some fucking reason.  Right.  But all that doesn't matter as soon as he threw that uppercut.  Well, who knows if she did anything before that? 
[00:53:00]  Like, she might have poked him.  Yeah.  No one's gonna care.  She probably was the problem, but he blew it by punching her.  She could take a punch like that.  She wasn't even shocked.  Something tells me she's been in other men's face before and other men have punched her  in the fucking head.  Because she wasn't even, like, surprised, really, that he fucking decked her.  I thought uppercuts knocked you out.  I know if you hit someone in the jaw sideways, that's a guaranteed knockout if you hit them hard enough.  If you hit them hard enough, but why didn't she go down?  And smack her head snapped back.  Holy fuckaroni.  That should've knocked her out. 
[00:53:30]  Should've.  And then he throws her on her face outside the bus and then she's back on the bus.  Throws her out.  Seeming pretty fine.  They're just, uh, wow.  There is a problem.  Yeah.  There is a grave problem with self-respect and I don't know.  I, uh, amazing.  There's a correction.  Jason Wirth did not win the series for the Natitudes.  I fucked that up.  There is a game five, uh, in that series as well.  I apologize for misinformation. 
[00:54:00]  Feeling all happy again for a second until you reminded me that the Yankees didn't win  it, uh, all last night.  And you feeling good about it tonight?  Yeah, I'm feeling pretty good.  It's not even tonight.  Five o'clock, I think?  Yeah, CC Spathia.  Five o'clock start.  It's gonna be pitching, motherfucker.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, um, but like I said, I, uh, have red-eye taping tonight.  Yeah.  So, hopefully, um...  Isn't that about the time the game starts?  The game will be, uh...  No.  No.  Did you tape right at 820 to 915 or so?  Oh, fuck. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, no.  Yeah, the game should be over by then.  Yeah, it should be.  Unless it's extra fucking innings and...  Yeah, I know.  Damn it.  It's...  I like Chief Nakahoma in Cleveland.  Chief...  That's his name.  Yeah.  The fucking thing that pops up.  Chief Nakahoma.  It's nice.  Because they're Indians.  You gotta have an Indian name.  I like that.  Nakahoma.  Yeah.  Oof.  So are these Playboy girls gonna show us anything today?  Or are they gonna just come in and look pretty?  No, never.  Probably not.  Nothing wrong with looking pretty, but... 
[00:55:00]  We used to do things with girls like this.  We used to.  Not anymore.  They're coming in today?  Oh, yeah.  And then Bill Burr's coming in.  Nice.  Bill Burr's back in town already?  Yes.  Well, I would show more enthusiasm about the nude girls.  Yeah.  Bill, who I love, but...  No, I mean...  Well, I used to be excited about this shit, too.  But then their attitudes...  I'm not saying, like...  We never met these girls, so, you know, keep an open mind, but...  Try.  We saw how this whole thing has changed over the years.  Yeah.  These girls were more than willing to just have a little fun with the fact that they do get nude. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, not anymore.  Not so much.  How many girls have said...  We go, hey, could, you know, you take, you know, your clothes off or whatever?  I mean, we're nicer than that.  And they're like, well, you got the magazine right in front of you.  Are we really, though?  Sure.  Are we nicer than that?  Yeah, we have.  Or do we just say, take your clothes off?  No, we've been more, like...  Yeah.  More...  Nah, yeah.  Not as bad as we used to be, definitely.  But then they turn to us and go, you got the magazine right in front of you.  Yeah.  It's like, yeah, but you're right in front of us.  It's the...  Yeah, excuse me.  Two-dimension or three-dimension? 
[00:56:00]  Right.  I opt for third-dimensional nudity.  And then you're having a debate with these girls.  No one wins.  I don't want to debate you, Jerry.  It's not a debate.  But they're coming in.  It should be fine.  Playgirls, Playboy Girls in studio.  Bill Burr in studio.  What do we usually have over here?  Because that ain't it.  No, it's a weird...  It's E is on.  It was some weird infomercial before.  Oh, uh...  I want the money channel.  Yeah, I think it's the money channel or something.  I want the rich guy that doesn't believe in paying his fair share channel.  We're trying to get the latest on the Lohans. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, is that it?  Yes.  The Lohans.  The Lohans.  We got an update on that situation.  That father is just a fucking pig.  What a piece of shit, right?  He's a fucking pig, that guy.  A piece of shit.  Wow.  This is an obvious one, but we said it yesterday.  We're like, what a piece of shit this guy is taping the phone call.  Yeah.  Lindsay Lohan reaches out to her father because she's in another situation with her stupid  mom.  And then you got the father taping it and then supposedly editing it a little bit and then  throwing it off to TMZ.  The media.  What a fucking twat this guy is. 
[00:57:00]  What a fucking no-talent fame whore this guy is.  Yep.  Notice me.  So now Lohan hates her father.  I don't blame her.  I don't blame her.  I almost feel sorry for her at this point.  I almost feel sorry for her at this point.  Because she was calling the dad to tell him how much she hates her mother.  I know.  And then the father is fucking her over while she's telling her how she hates the mother.  They're all fucking over Lindsay Lohan.  Oh, poor Lindsay Lohan.  But they really are a couple of fucking pigs, her parents.  I wonder if they'll realize when she drops dead what they did to this poor girl. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I actually do feel bad for her now.  But then Lindsay's like, oh, I didn't mean to say my mom was on cocaine because that's  not true.  Like they're all just backtracking and spinning.  But when you're saying something to your father and it's all of a sudden on TMZ, it's  like then she's got to defend her mom to the public.  She probably wasn't trying to attack her mother in front of the whole country.  Right.  Can you imagine that you can't even call your parents in confidence, not knowing if they're  going to tape it and put it on like the enemy of the TMZ for her? 
[00:58:00]  You know, where can she go?  What a fucking dick that guy is.  That's a dick move.  Just a dick move.  Wow.  It's a real dick move.  I love it.  Barbara Streisand story.  I would love to hear her because she's like pretty.  Well, she returned home to Brooklyn, everyone.  Oh, good.  Look, it says, who said you can't go home?  She went there for a payday.  You idiots.  Yeah, please.  She just made, how many millions?  She'd made more than a million last night. 
[00:58:30]  Does she pay her fair share?  I hope she pays her fair share.  That whole going home crap.  Who said you can't go home?  She went there because there's now an amazing arena in Brooklyn.  She had many opportunities to go back to Brooklyn.  Guess what?  She wasn't going back to Brooklyn.  The money wasn't right.  To Brooklyn.  To Brooklyn.  I don't think so.  I'm now a Brooklyn Nets fan, by the way.  You are?  Yeah.  Me too. 
[00:59:00]  Are you really?  That's my team.  I decided today in the bathroom while I was on the shitter.  What made you decide?  A big lump of shit coming out of his head.  Because I can't stand Carmelo Anthony.  He's the man.  Jeremy Lin is gone.  It's the same old shit that Knicks fans are going to have to deal with.  So I said, you know what?  I'm going to fucking turn over a new leaf.  I'm a Brooklyn Nets fan starting today.  Get in a shirt?  Like Roland?  I don't know.  I don't look good in black.  I have a hat.  You have a hat though?  I have a Nets hat.  Isn't it all black though? 
[00:59:30]  The fucking logo stinks.  Black and white.  I'm going to use that when people ask if I want to have sex with an African American woman.  I don't look good.  I don't look good in black.  Yeah, that's good.  I'm going to use that.  I think Devon Williams is going to be my man now.  You know why the Nets are my team?  Why?  Jay-Z.  Of course.  I don't know any of the players.  But that's just like voting.  You just proved my point.  That's right.  Everyone votes for the dumbest reasons.  It's funny, on TV. 
[01:00:00]  Who do you want to see on TV the most for the next four years?  Biden.  I would like to see a little more Biden.  You just fucking convinced me.  I'm going to vote for Obama.  Oh, Jesus.  This is going to be the first time I've ever voted in a presidential election.  Finally, someone with some sense in this place.  That's all I want to hear.  Dude, that's all I want to hear.  I can't switch to MSNBC fast enough after a debate or something just to see him losing  his fucking mind, whether he's happy or sad about something.  He's just always so passionate. 
[01:00:30]  Love it.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  We've got more clips from the debate.  We can do that next.  Ooh.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Oh, boy.  I've got to make another correction.  Oh.  What happened?  I'm a little tired, man.  I'm a father of two.  Ooh.  My newborn is only seven days old. 
[01:01:00]  I shouldn't even be here.  You've had a 100% increase in children.  Yeah.  Amazing.  But the tax write-off is nice.  Ah.  Some of those loopholes.  That's right.  Now I'm a Brooklyn Nets fan, but I don't even know how to pronounce the guy's names.  Oh, shit.  So I'm getting shit because I said Duran, I think, and it's pronounced Derin.  I don't know black names.  It's hard.  It is hard.  It is hard to figure out what the name actually is.  Duran.  Duran.  Duran.  Duran.  Duran. 
[01:01:30]  Duran.  They're a fantastical band.  Duran.  Duran.  Duran.  Duran.  Duran.  Duran.  Duran.  Duran.  Duran.  Duran.  Duran.  Duran.  Duran.  Duran.  Duran.  Duran.  Duran.  Duran.  Duran.  Duran.  Duran.  Duran.  Duran.  Duran.  Duran.  with the silver tip oh parents know this tiny like this much is the silver tip so okay that's

[01:14:30]  played with yeah i don't take an advantage you're taking advantage dude honestly if a girl puts too  much finger on my ass i have to shit i make her stop i don't like i like i like the concept of it  but i can't take more than a little bit of finger from a chick cannot take it it's not a sexual thing  no simply just a cleanliness thing and i gotta side with jimmy then you know you get out of the  shower you lay down on the bed you open your cheeks wide and just enjoy yeah but three knuckles deep  no i don't do that that's you gotta get it all out you gotta get it all put your entire finger in 
[01:15:00]  are you just saying that for for fun radio no and i have sausages for fingers  i equate it though with uh yeah when when i wash uh i wash my car yes i will clean the exhaust pipe  tip but i don't go up to the catalytic converter with a fucking sponge a soapy sponge that's cool but  if there was a chick who's gonna fucking lick the catalytic converter you bet you'd start doing that  sam sam comment sam no i don't put any i mean i wipe normally good boy okay so here's the 
[01:15:30]  i don't wrap a toilet paper around my finger and shove a finger anybody out there that wants to  eat an ass on the opium anthony show you know whose ass you're eating first that's true it's  clean as clean as a whistle fucking three stinky cracks in hair and my my glistening fuck you can  hold an egg in my asshole i bet sam still gets baby rash what do you mean baby rash you know do you  i don't even know what baby rash is well you don't have kids yet a newborn baby rash no i don't get 
[01:16:00]  newborn baby rash you're past that of course i'm past that probably has fucking nappy ass hair oh jesus  there's a little hair back there how's your ass sorry it's good it's clean but it's not clean but  i don't put fingers in it it's not clean i don't scoop shit out of my asshole like this pleasant caller  did it's not it's but your ass is not clean your ass appears clean from the outside you're a hoarder's  house asshole like as soon as that door opens it's a fucking disaster i don't know uh you think you  think a lot of uh girls uh stick their fingers up their ass to clean that you're eating girl ass and 
[01:16:30]  it's you're not coming out with a fucking little nugget no but i've gotten some stink girl ass  yeah and not the sexy kind of like a chick with a sweaty ass or a little sweaty pussy can be really  nice but i mean some i've gotten that were like what do you do you wipe or do you just fucking do  you just dab your asshole with a fucking towel and get on with it i like a clean asshole but i like  it to stink a little let's see how to mike in jersey we're gonna learn about baby periods  mike hey mike mike hey what's going on i i got three girls at home and uh yeah i've seen it 
[01:17:00]  it freaked me out turns out it's because of the hormones from the mom that uh in uh either if  she's breastfeeding then in the breast milk or just the hormones that your baby was exposed to when  she was inside your wife what does you know that your your wife has all the estrogen and progesterone  the thing what are you talking about oh yeah i know what he's saying oh baby period the kids  drinking the milk oh how about you would have brought up the fact that you're talking about  baby period i said oh did you i said i didn't listen i know they're not good enough to fucking 
[01:17:30]  actually say what they're talking about yeah uh pretty plus more on the twitter i gotta stop  following her because she's a weirdo she says oh jimmy's not alone people with extreme ocd are known  to use toothbrushes up there oh there's no way yeah i don't feel for me it's an ocd thing i can  remember being a kid i told you what and then you use it for your teeth you just own one toothbrush  use someone else's toothbrush while you're on i would assume it's a special attachment right i 
[01:18:00]  would hope so yeah it's like a little fist on it that turns a little tiny fist a bristly fist  but i remember going to i told you i was going to marvin's house and i hadn't wiped good enough  and my fucking asshole was chafing oh boy it was like red like  it was raw ass cheeks from sweat not wiping good enough when i was a kid i didn't wipe good  enough my asshole would get raw oh jimmy i learned that's the acidic content what there's a difference 
[01:18:30]  between not wiping well and shoving your fingers up your ass i don't shove my fingers up my i put a  finger in there with paper on it and then fucking i i really i get it out good would you brush your  teeth do you just go on the front of the teeth or do you get in there under the gums a little and  behind the teeth i just brush your tongue as long as you're clean and right up to the watertight  doors right i think you're all right there you go yeah but then when you lean over i'd hate to be  naked with anthony because you probably lean over and your asshole probably opens you goes  and it's not a fart it's just it's the airlock stink oh god no no because because uh when when i 
[01:19:00]  when i shower and i will usually shower after a really abominable time on the turlet  sometimes i will like to shower sometimes yeah sometimes you just gotta in case of emergency  brick glass kind of situation and you just get in there with a washcloth and soap and just soap  everything up real nice and then you're clean as a whistle are you getting in there uh more so with a 
[01:19:30]  washcloth then i would um but not just uh but not going in and no no not like jimmy no oh my god  in the shower i put the fucking leg up asshole aimed at the thing and fucking rub finger on my soap  i don't put my finger all in because i don't want to burn but i make sure my i fucking pucker it out and  i just i clean i'll take the whole side of my index i'll take the whole side of my index finger and  give it a good worshing yeah to the whole area but that's not effective at all yeah anything worse than 
[01:20:00]  getting swamp ass when you're out and about i don't get swamp ass no you don't get swamp ass no i  haven't gotten swamp ass since i was living in my car back in the fucking old days stinks literally  and then you know there's no bathroom anywhere anywhere is uh stuck with it yeah so fucking  but that's why you're getting it because there's so much fucking germs and logs right at the door  it's almost like you're you have a house and it's bursting with duty and you're just cleaning the  outside of the door you're not you're not opening the door and cleaning on the inside a little bit 
[01:20:30]  so what happens is it just seeps out and your ass hair picks up like a little seepage yeah i understand  what you're saying but you take it right into the study all right maybe i'm a little too clean  yeah i get under the rugs and everything yeah exactly you're trying to sweep pantry he's trying  to sweep the dirt out the back door fuck i like a nice clean ass makes me feel like a better  person yeah that's true what's up with uh poo that disappears what you mean you're you're you know  you're going and then you you look right every time i look while i'm shitting and then but what what 
[01:21:00]  is it that every once in a while like you look and there's nothing there what what is that about  you mean literally nothing or just a little bit no nothing it goes down into the fucking uh pipe oh  yeah but what sneak in there yeah what what is the magic involved there you know you know you  you know you did your thing and all of a sudden you look you're like where the fuck did it go  that's a carnival game actually if you can shit make it disappear into the pipe you're a stuffed  animal into the is it extra slippery or something what happens oh no is do you have a runny fucking um 
[01:21:30]  a runny toilet oh because then all the times you see what you yeah the damage you did maybe it's  the expulsion you're very forceful with it so it shoots right down and all the way into the  or it's a good tapered log you know what it is it's like a big sea monster going back into its hole  you can almost hear going now now having known something a little bit about a plumbing in my day  i do have a theory here and i just i get get this i think the bigger the log the more apt it is to 
[01:22:00]  sneak into the pipe and here's why when you drop it in it will displace the water and make the level  higher now the toilet has a constant water level right and that's how it flushes you add water  to the bowl it's going to try to seek its own level and it winds up sucking back in that's brilliant  whoever invented the toilet is quite amazing but since the log is raising the level it then lets a  little water go through that pipe making a vacuum and sucking the shit through the pipe into the waste 
[01:22:30]  myth bust i think that's it myth myth this would be a great video for you to make yes just you  talking seriously about why you think certain logs disappear yes how to videos youtube do real well  man make a how-to video you'll be surprised how two videos do well and it could be the most boring  as shit i don't know how to but you guys you just got to find a topic no one else has done how to 
[01:23:00]  yet yeah yeah a tutorial i'm serious i want to make a tutorial i'm trying to think of one  like put in um how about on the making of a tutorial how to boil an egg yeah tell me how  many views uh the big video has on that how to boil an egg  uh 150 000  jeez yeah and that's no um i put it in water how and i like boiled eggs right but that's just that 
[01:23:30]  nobody doesn't have a fan base yeah how i would guarantee how to peel hard-boiled eggs without  peeling right 4.2 million 4.2 million it's almost iphone to peel a fucking egg hard-boiled egg see i  told you well you know i did do an installation of vista that's a tutorial all right look i put it  through a shredder but do a how-to video you'll be surprised how to wait you did a how-to video how to 
[01:24:00]  cook a chicken in a bag oh chicken in a bag that was pretty good did you yeah yeah i made a chicken  in a bag it's pretty good uh i know why we have invisible shit because it depends you want to hear  a girl talk about shit yeah more than i want to breathe michelle hello hi michelle hi what's up  hi hi michelle hi so i know why we have invisible shit okay well it depends on what you're eating  if you're eating uh fatty foods your density of your shit is thicker so it will sink right to the 
[01:24:30]  bottom if you're eating healthier foods foods doesn't she sound fat you have a fat voice i have  a fat voice are you are you would you consider yourself a little overweight it's either that or  you're hispanic no i'm not hispanic are you a little overweight that means you're overweight no i'm  not overweight a little bit i got the chart right here how much yeah how much do i weigh i weigh 125  how tall that means 138 right okay and how tall five six she's probably fine all right you know what 
[01:25:00]  i'm looking at this chart here you're all right you're all right my mistake you just okay you have  carry on you have the fat voice  i do have a deep voice what kind of logs do you normally drop what um it depends i do get a lot  of invisible but i eat pretty healthy it's just when you can notice that when you don't eat healthy  would you say they're longer logs or would you say they're smaller little pebble logs that  plink into the toilet oh jesus it depends it depends with her theory e-rox must be like a bobsled 
[01:25:30]  going down the fucking he actually has to flush the toilet using his heel  by fucking jamming shit with the back of his shoe  he e-rock has a pair of fucking sewer boots next to his toilet he puts them on and steps his duty  down like he's making wine with grapes fine wine yeah you there's a handicapped fucking handlebar  but it's three feet above the toilet he holds on so he doesn't fucking crack his head open 
[01:26:00]  smashing his shit you think he buys uh plungers in bulk yeah he goes through a lot of them oh  god he has toes with long extensions built onto them so he can just get into that pipe  fucking half log you're not coming just i'm aggressively working his toilet every day  toilet takes a beating yeah  eric eric who took the worst shit in your house so far come on give him the answer eric uh that 
[01:26:30]  would be you the opster you what'd the opster do i thought i was safe i went way downstairs uh i went  to one of his many um house opening parties oh i thought many bathrooms in the nagel mansion  yes he does have a lot the nagel estate big-ass motherfucking house he's got nine bathrooms in his  house jesus eric had how many house warming parties three two two how many did you go to  jim i haven't been invited oh you didn't get invited to either one yeah i was supposed to be  invited to both but then i guess i pissed him off and we weren't invited to the second one yeah i 
[01:27:00]  didn't get to go either i had everybody to his house i i was supposed to be part of the family  one too but something went awry oh boy but uh maybe because of the shit i left at the other one  but i went downstairs like he gave me the house tour and i found this bathroom like nice and i was  feeling a little weird the opster ate some weird shit and uh i went down there when no one was  noticing and oh bad wow and then i didn't know that eric was giving another tour a mere few minutes  after i was done oh another tour group was coming through he started heading down the stairs not 
[01:27:30]  even near the bathroom and he's not exaggerating i swear to god cloud the peppy lepew cloud started  hitting people's faces not only did i fuck up that bathroom i i fucked up the room leading to the  bathroom he's not lying that bad yes jesus yeah i had confirmation that it was a doozy yeah  remember the fucking k-rock bathroom that was right off the studio oh yeah and you could just take a  shit no jimmy would come out smiling sometimes and and i wouldn't flush yeah yeah i would flush  actually beforehand and then just wait a couple of minutes and then take a dump and then i would 
[01:28:00]  fucking leave it and spread the paper so whoever walked in there got what i like to call a visual  treat he used to do that to anthony either before or just after anthony ate it was terrible it would  the whole studio would stink the whole studio once that door opened up would stink oh man was that bad  that's the only reason we went through our shit phase yeah true like any great artist we we had

[01:34:30]  need to know that who are we playing who's in front of me i'm creating mayhem yeah yeah yeah yeah he's  he is the the greatest defensive player ever he's the best i ever saw and and he doesn't even know  all the teams just just the brilliance do you believe that that he doesn't know the teams and all  that or oh no absolutely really absolutely no because it was in we were in the green room i'm  not trying to speak out of turn here this isn't a bad story i think he just he just in the middle  of this awesome story he goes we were down in uh he's like new orleans and he goes what's what's 
[01:35:00]  name my team in new orleans and somebody's like saints saints yeah so well it's amazing yeah i felt  like such a nerd guy because i was just like yeah i really that was the biggest thing on doing that  show was me fighting feeling like not even being worthy to be there to be in the room with those  guys yeah i i've done one other show like that i did a stand up at the uh uh the baseball awards  where they've given it like the cy young so you bring a comedian in because they're worried that 
[01:35:30]  these athletes are gonna you know probably a bunch of stiffs yeah no dude dude they're fucking  hilarious they're on the stage for some reason like the espies and all that baseball awards i remember  was the year willie randolph went from the uh from the yankees over to the mets okay and he went up  there started telling stories and started talking trash about how the mets were going to kick the  yankees ass i'm coming for you joe torrey and everybody's laughing dude these guys were so funny  i was just sitting there enjoying the show almost forgetting that i had to go on after and then they're 
[01:36:00]  telling stories about being in the world series and all that crap and then i come walking up there like  hey what's up with the flobie and you just you feel like you're this big real men that are  accomplished manly exactly zillions of people watching and they can just block it all out and  hit a curveball and i'm gonna come up there with my stupid five minutes did you do well i actually did  all right and um um i did i did okay but was completely you didn't you didn't need me it was so 
[01:36:30]  evident yeah they were all right me yeah oh yeah and uh and inside the nfl i what i did i just stayed  in the wheelhouse stay in your wheelhouse you're the moron from the stands that they brought in  don't try to be one of the guys commentators or right so we went to go pick the games i wasn't  going to sit there and be like well i like the corners in seattle it's like there's no way i'm  going to say that after somebody's wearing a super bowl ring it's telling me why they're going to win  it so i would just said dumb stuff like that's great all right tampa where they got they got a 
[01:37:00]  pirate ship at this stadium that doesn't seem like they're taking it too serious i'll go with the  that's perfect yeah so i just kept it like that but like the amount of times i had to fight you know  i'm not worthy i'm not worthy like throughout that whole show was uh that's pretty cool yeah dude like  what were you on beyond starstruck a little bit because you're like a huge 100 yeah 100 and then  they were totally down to earth just shooting the shit with me like i was like like i played or  something oh man and uh oh no they were greatest guys and they were just like yeah you let up give 
[01:37:30]  them more shit give them more shit like you know saying like you know break people's you know balls  they're gonna have you back obviously because that's great man who knows that's great everyone  said you did great yeah if they never do it was it was the greatest time now you were about to say  something about joe girardi right before we turned these mics on i said yo hold save it for the air  oh i okay red socks and hates the yankees i gotta tell you that was the baddest move  it was like a hollywood movie yeah to pull a guy of over 600 home runs and stick in this other guy 
[01:38:00]  looks like he's like 90 i mean and then he hits the tying and then the go-ahead home run amazing like  it was i was i can't think of a more guts you call to the point i'm sitting there i hate hate the  yankees the next day i'm sitting in a diner reading the story and i'm smiling here i don't  want him to win and i was just like dude that was like finally someone that had some balls the ball  but then he turns around that was a damned if you do damned if you don't decision and he worked out 
[01:38:30]  and he totally but then he turns around he puts a rod back in the lineup but he pushes him back to  sixth though he kind of has to put him in fifth and then why do you have to put the guy in he's  slumping so bad what does he have one hit in the series two maybe two i'll tell you like last night  he got a single and everybody was cheering that he fucking like he hit his back oh he hit a home run  it was sarcastic yeah it was all like yeah look at that i blooped one into fucking left is a write him 
[01:39:00]  another check yeah exactly even yankees uh yankee fans hate him yes yankee fans don't like  always hated a rod yeah yeah never liked a rod because he was never a fucking homegrown  no he's a seattle mariner he's a fucking edgar martinez jay buehner mariner all those other  homegrown ones look when you look at somebody though like jeter and fucking rivera when they  came up and they they were i don't think it's about that at all fucking yankees i think it's more  about he comes across very than a yankee fan hates more than a big name free agent 
[01:39:30]  oh those sons of bitches your team's littered with them look but that's not that's not the  yankee fan's choice so that's what steinbrenner did when he was out and gene michael ran the team  that's why that fucking dynasty was built i think steinbrenner is so overrated it's ridiculous  you're missing the point i think i think it is that he comes across so fucking entitled is what  people hate all these guys are entitled but they don't they don't show it on their face  at every at bat look yankee fans would absolutely love a rod if he every time he went up he did what 
[01:40:00]  is expected of a 200 million dollar guy they would love him and there would be no one where  he said well he's not a homegrown guy they wouldn't give a shit exactly the bottom you're right and  what does that mean he's got a bat what over 300 i've never seen a guy more in his head you  remember when jeter dove into the stands a rod's reaction he puts he like a silent film reaction  to he puts his hands on his head and i almost think that that he was trying not to show he probably  was like going i hope he's hurt so i don't have to stand next to him anymore and my my 
[01:40:30]  underachievement is so glaring i think it's almost like trying to hide it like with that whole  oh golly gee when he puts both hands on his head yeah yeah who reacts like that that's like that  home alone thing nobody oh no like nobody does that i'll tell you what though on uh oh all right  here we go well a little a little weird he swings and he misses and then he snaps his finger  you ever see that god dang it he was hated before he came to new york like and randy johnson came to 
[01:41:00]  new york didn't perform remained hated uh kenny rogers was hated before he came from texas he's  got great didn't perform yeah i know i know that but he just felt like in front of a country bumpkin  showing up but and people hated him because he didn't perform chuck knoblock was hated and he came  and did okay and people liked him until he started throwing the balls the fucking 50th row yeah  all of a sudden he forgot how to throw a ball he couldn't throw it first paul o'neal came in from  cincinnati i think people loved him yeah fucking scott broches came in people love paul o'neal yeah 
[01:41:30]  i saw paul o'neal like three different times swing hits a fly ball and you see him go god damn it  as he's going to first and it was a home run yeah but he meant it when he he hated fucking up  no like three times he would curse and then it would actually be a home run it's the funniest  thing ever well we got game five today so you're going to game in no no i'm not going tonight oh  you got the red eye yeah it's not two two one it's two three yeah they went two three this year yeah 
[01:42:00]  two three so three at the stadium uh that doesn't sound a one game now the orioles huh it's down a one  fucking game well yankees had a better record yeah but two three is weird they always went uh two two one  right yeah two two one travis that's the extra travel day i think but three games in a row at  the other guy's place is a little rough right well they took they took one yeah you should have won  should have won uh more games yeah did that used to be that way you should have taken that game in  june a little more seriously yeah though that's why i hate nba the nba finals is the worst thing ever 
[01:42:30]  two three two right and the team with the worst record gets the three in the middle so you basically  give them home court advantage through the first five out of a seven game series it's the nba  oh players don't like to travel that's the worst when we go to every go to play the fucking lakers  we're out in la for like 10 days sitting in a ramada they're out there you know in their own  jacuzzis it's the stupidest thing ever yeah wasn't it different when we were growing up me and  we're trying to remember that didn't they travel back and forth a lot more one one one it was right 
[01:43:00]  okay see i was telling you that travis it was two two one one one back in the day but didn't  baseball used to be two and three wasn't it for some reason i remember the yankees mariners series  years ago two games in the stadium three in seattle the yankees were up two games to none  what year is this though 95 well i'm talking about the 80s no no but i mean in 95 it was two and three  in baseball and then they dropped three straight in seattle they were up to nothing and they dropped  three fucking straight games to the mariners yeah no two three two came about i want to say in the 
[01:43:30]  late 80s right two two one one one was way better it was more fair for the person you want to have  if it's two three two you want the worst record because all you got to do is steal one not saying  that's easy but the thing is even if you lose the first two you still have home court advantage  three games until you lose that that third game through five games and you had a worse record  makes a lot of sense wow it burns me up if you lose the first but bill if you lose the first two 
[01:44:00]  doesn't if you if you lose the first two on the road then you can't possibly clinch at home right  because you only have three but my thing is you still to get back up to three two you you're playing  three games in a row at home yeah and if you steal one yeah you still if you win game one in a two  three two and you got the three in the middle i mean okay so now you're at one oh the next four  games three out of four are in your building and you had a worst record yeah jimmy i'm telling you 
[01:44:30]  it's for the birds no one complains about this shit though no no no hockey was supposed to start  and uh well that's no one gives a fuck no one cares he has a fear of success as you wear your  bruins hat we should be at hockey games right now and no one gives a fuck no one cares  no one i think it was supposed to start about it i think the games were supposed to start  yesterday and do you see anybody writing about or anything not in the news they did they fuck it 
[01:45:00]  they fucked themselves no one they had all that momentum going right they already have it where  you know the the tom brady and brett farve smash a stick over each other's heads and punch each  other in the face they already had that that that doesn't necessarily even happen with the stars but  people think it does and you know then you combine that with like you know doing what baseball did  like you know canceling the world series i mean they're saying that they might even not have a  season there's no way they're that dumb there's no way you know what it takes to recover from that 
[01:45:30]  like yeah yeah they're still far apart they lost me yeah yeah they lost me for a couple years  and then what sucked was then they finally come back and then like uh who won like the ducks won it  and carolina won it and i was just like i didn't even know what was going on  yeah the whole thing i don't i still don't care why they got rid of the red line  oh yeah i like that you got rid of the red line dude all you had to do was just make the lock or  one of the trap just make it an illegal defense like they did in the nba right oh that's too  effective illegal defense what does that mean i don't know what that means red line well it made 
[01:46:00]  it harder to advance the puck when you had the red line yeah they were always blowing out fucking  whistle you had to you had to stay behind all the lines as you're moving up you couldn't have a  two-line pass as you're coming out of your zone there's a blue line and a red line you had to  pass it or carry the puck you couldn't you couldn't basically send it you know all the way down the  ice yeah yeah or a lot further down the ice why they why'd they change that just to make the game  quicker because of the effectiveness of the trap and the left wing lock which was basically bringing  a forward back to the blue line jimmy this is common sense i don't like hockey you know jimmy feels 
[01:46:30]  exactly like you felt with those guys when your team talks to you because that's that's how you feel  when you talk to bill bill's very sports knowledgeable you're very sports i don't know  anything about i've never watched a lot of hockey in my life hockey's fun to watch nah i wish i hate  it i wish i enjoyed it especially if you're there it's very yeah it's a it's a great it's a very  difficult game to get people into um when they're watching on tv for whatever reason i've never had a  problem watching it but like they finally got games on nbc again it's like now they're fucking it up 
[01:47:00]  yeah they're like it's going in their favor it's like one of those rehab shows and every time they  start playing that he's going to turn it around music yeah then then the graphic comes on yeah  they had the relapse hockey relapsed hockey is exhausting though a lot of work to get a goal these  days yeah used to see real plays when we were growing up in hockey it's one of the greatest old  now they're just they're just poking at the puck the entire time hoping for there's a lot of luck in 
[01:47:30]  hockey you would agree right yeah but dude it's one of the greatest old man sports you could play  all these guys going out playing golf you're out of your fucking mind you're still playing i just  took the game up two years ago i always wanted to play but i had no my parents weren't going to get up  at four in the morning to drive me to the rink for some game they don't even watch they didn't watch  the game you had to come from a hockey family you know this right aunt what you had to go to the  rink at four in the morning there's only time you could get ice time we used to do that i didn't know  that no yeah well well that's why the canadians are so much better they just walk outside and play 
[01:48:00]  if you really are into the sport on long island or but i guess they just dig a hole in their  backyard and fill it with garden hose water and now they have a rink when we were in high school  he had a rink in his backyard yeah yeah i i saw that when we were in high school we would get we  would rent the rink at like four something in the morning five in the morning something like that  what parent wants to do that why only why only so early because i mean you know prime time they  also had shit going yeah you had to go to school there just wasn't a lot of rinks is really expensive  wow and there were there's just not enough rinks out there who loves hockey that much to get up 
[01:48:30]  that fucking early we played like 11 30 at night till one in the morning like once a week we play  the middle of the night oh you you play now okay oh and you're still doing those weird hours  oh it's great can you skate because i can skate my stick handling is like uh texting while driving  looking down looking up looking down and there's no way to get better at it other than to be on the  ice because they say oh you know stick handle excuse me stick handling your garage it's just like no 
[01:49:00]  doesn't work are you all right though compared to everybody else were you i'm i'm upper sucking  i took it i took it up in like um but you're loving it 2010 yeah you know what it is about skating  is it doesn't kill your body because it's not the pounding and we we don't hit or anything it's a  non-contact league um not even a league it's just a bunch of bums going out there on a whatever  night and um and you actually feel fast but your jersey's moving your jersey's fluttering so you're  gliding i'm doing all right here yeah so yeah i can you know forwards backwards i can do that 
[01:49:30]  but uh you can backwards skate yeah when you get a little fucking action where you break away and you're  you're driving toward the goalie are you just like feeling like this is fucking great no i'm always  scared like because i know there's somebody just gets the last seconds i bring my stick up he's  gonna hook my stick and i'm gonna miss the puck i have like uh i i redefine panicking with the puck  like i get it like pass it pass it shoot it that's great have you scored at all yes i have and it's 
[01:50:00]  it's the greatest feeling ever what's funny was all those rink rats they score they don't give a  fuck it's not a league game i score it's like lake placid i'm like both hands up the fucking fist  pump one leg in the air oh yeah the first time i scored i did that and then they everybody laughed  at me of course they did all right let's tone it down i was like such a geek i always wondered what  that felt like good for bill burr that's great and i am i'm the biggest nerd ever so it's it's a yeah  it's it's a great time but uh i was actually wearing skates that i got in like high school i had 
[01:50:30]  these bauer panthers that you know back then it was like literally wearing like a cinder block with  like a like a blade underneath it so i finally broke down and bought a new pair it's like wearing  slippers man yeah it's unbelievable they're unbelievable carbon fiber and yeah yeah i don't  know what lightweight polymers they run remember how much your foot would hurt after you skated for a  while oh yeah it felt like you were in misery because the inside of a fucking skate was just  a blister maker yeah it was all now they're all nice and fucking like you're like you're wearing a 
[01:51:00]  sneaker right it was like i was like untreated leather yeah yeah i don't know what it was but  it was terrible it was terrible and your your toes would get cold if you played outside they  didn't even have that figured out and nothing figured out i want to i still don't think that  they have that figured oh no it's still fucking cold but they do have something now they call  skate fenders and you you put them on your your skates that's for like you know when people take  slap shots and stuff and you know a lot of guys don't wear them i guess those are considered  what do you mean it's like this little it's just a piece of plastic it's for the side of your 
[01:51:30]  foot because your heel and your toe kind of have something hard right there's nothing worse than  taking a puck to the foot right oh shit right okay you feel like you got shot so you know it's funny  you try to man up but when you get hit you just you you try to get up you go back down and then  you do this awful crawl off the ice i'm good i'm good and you know there's no way to look cool  oh yeah dude and this is the thing too everybody's night's over when that happens  really unless they were like a big time jock they'll come back out but if you're just some 
[01:52:00]  fucking accountant out there for the exercise it's like i'm not gonna try to get this giant  foot and a wingtip tomorrow i'm done night night is over that's great yeah so they got these things  they're called skate fenders so i i wear them and i got a little bit of shit i don't care can you show  me what it looks like i really don't know what do you do you put them on extra on the outside of  your shoe yeah actually you wouldn't they're clear uh there they are right there like uh the guys in  the nhl wear them now oh shit okay yeah it's the stupidest thing ever that's that like spats for 
[01:52:30]  your skates yeah but it's the dumbest thing ever that no one ever came up with something that's  pretty smart yeah um i guess like 10 to 15 percent of the injuries in the league are foot related from  shots or something like that so guys are starting to wear them you know how much it was hurting of  a fucking professional hockey player slam a puck into the side of your fucking heel yeah they take  him in the face uh the old they said chara how fast he shoots it it's literally like getting  shot with like a 22 caliber two foot he's six seven something like that with skates he's almost 
[01:53:00]  seven foot tall on the ice he's a lot of leverage it's really funny yeah they had they had to come  up with this you know like uh they had to change how uh the legal size of a stick because the biggest  one was still too small for him so all of that torque oh man right yeah it's over yeah you're just  you're getting more fucking you've never seen this guy no man let me see him sam we used to have him  on the islander but when you when you another player we gave up on there are guys that will  actually block that shot when it's going that fit like i mean with their sticks like guys that 
[01:53:30]  will actually stop that they do the dive in front of the net and they'll take it i mean another player  that will see that shot another player oh really yeah they'll dive yeah they're nuts so somebody in  the playoffs they'll drop their whole body down to block the puck before it gets uh to the goal  by the way we're the only show talking about hockey yeah we're actually talking about hockey  yeah but he makes it oh please i know don't make shit interesting great funnish shit we shouldn't  be talking about you're right at no it's funnish shit um i you know i want to show bill burr that 
[01:54:00]  video we all looked at you see the latest viral video on the bus it's your bit it's it's a it's a  woman acting up knowing that no nobody would hit her oh yeah oh jesus okay yeah yeah show bill  burr this oh wait the setup hold on sorry and it's on our facebook page by now you're on full screen  everyone's checking this out this is the biggest video of the day so you got a uh public bus in  cleveland and the video picks up where this uh obviously there was a problem between the this 
[01:54:30]  woman or girl whatever and the bus driver and she's just getting in his face as he's driving the bus  and so somebody flipped their cam on and and you can tell it's your bit where she knows no one's  gonna fucking hit me i i can do whatever the fuck i want here oh this is hilarious oh boy  you're in the queue on the bus that's true you and your bitch i'll bring my granddaughter up here  that girl's a riot yeah now she pushes him while he's driving 
[01:55:00]  watch this oh oh oh she took it though she took it she totally takes an uppercut that would knock 
[01:55:30]  anyone that was that must have been open hand it it made a smack he might open maybe it was he might  have opened it he came back from here could you show the punch again wow because she fucking comes  back five times please no it's way back isn't it oh okay yeah yeah further no further oh sam you  stink no oh wait that was that was the freeze that looked close that was a freeze frame that  looked close looked close it described like when you're bowling that's where that punch came from

[01:56:30]  bit like like yeah yeah affected him while he was driving it definitely did that pissed him off  uh go back a little lead up to the um go back to the you're going to jail now him getting up  this is fun come on man i want to see this yeah we'll play it through now sorry  she comes right back at him 
[01:57:00]  I'm strangling her.  Unbelievable.  That's a fucking female.  I don't care.  If you want to be a man, I'm going to treat you like a man.  Oh, that should be music played right there.  Pause.  Yeah, it should be music played, basically. 
[01:57:30]  Wow.  It should be music, yes.  You're going to act like a man?  I'm going to treat you like a man.  I'm going to treat you like a man.  Oh, he yanked her weave out and everything.  Oh, he fucked her up.  I didn't see the part where he's strangling her.  When she came back on the bus, she had his hands around her throat.  I thought she was coming at him.  He was pulling her off by her weave.  He threw her off the bus.  I think he held on to it because she's got a lot less hair there now.  Yeah, yeah.  I think he threw her into the door.  Into the little door well.  Yeah, into the door well.  Well, he was throwing her stuff, too.  I bet you he opened the door when he stopped the bus because he started throwing her stuff down, too. 
[01:58:00]  He was throwing it off the bus.  This guy's so fired.  Oh, definitely.  Definitely.  Yeah.  Because they're going to say you should have got off the bus and called police.  He had a case until he fucking gave him the uppercut.  He fucking punched her, man.  Wow.  That's one of those in a perfect world.  Yeah.  You could have that.  If you want to act like a man, you're going to get to.  If somebody hits you first.  Right.  And then I love that.  That's a female.  Oh, you mean the one pushing me while I'm driving a bus?  Yeah, with you on it.  I could have drove into traffic because of her.  You mean her? 
[01:58:30]  The one I said like 15 times, just sit down, sit down.  Yeah.  No, he's going to lose his job.  He will lose his job.  Finish it up.  Go back slightly.  But I'll tell you in my America.  That's good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  And she took the poke out of her.  Pulling her hair. 
[01:59:00]  Yes, I am.  You're going to jail, bitch.  Chill out.  Chill out.  I need to go.  No, fuck that.  You're going to jail, bitch.  My nigga going to beat the brakes off you, bitch.  Oh, shit.  I need him in my dad, nigga.  Get up there.  Oh, man.  But you know something?  A person like that, it's like, where is your...  I mean, I didn't see what started the fight, but like, where is your own, like, personal  responsibility that you escalated it to a physical confrontation by your action? 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, the bus driver doesn't punch everybody that walks on the bus, so obviously she did  something to rile him up.  Right.  Yeah, whatever happened, she took it to a physical level.  Yes.  She brought it into that arena.  He stepped into the arena, and she lost, but now he's going to go to jail, which he  would...  Oh, yeah.  I would guarantee.  She'll probably sue.  Yeah.  The bus company.  And she'll get her fucking boyfriend or whatever.  She's going to get a good payday out of that, even though she's probably caused the whole  thing.  Unless she pushed him before that. 
[02:00:00]  We don't know what happened before the guy started filming.  The only thing that anybody has to say is the fact that, well, you don't hit a woman.  That's it, period.  There's no other thing like, well, she didn't escalate it that far.  She didn't deserve that.  It's just the fact that men don't hit women.  That's it.  Other than that, it's a perfectly good hit.  You know?  No, this is fun.  Like, the first comment.  People are such idiots.  This guy writes, or somebody wrote, when a female acts like man, don't be discouraged.  Womanly rights cannot save you now. 
[02:00:30]  All one sentence.  Thank you.  Thanks, Mr. Literate.  Is there any follow-up on this?  Can we find out maybe something's happened?  Oh, you don't need any follow-up.  Let's just read the comments.  What are some of the comments?  Oh, I'm sure they get nasty two, three down.  Bitch deserved it.  Bitch fucking deserved it.  That's what she gets.  All right.  I agree.  A lot of people agree.  Fred Sanford would have been proud.  Is that really on there? 
[02:01:00]  Fred Sanford.  Yeah, he was always threatening.  Should have fucking shot her instead.  Dread dumb bitch.  Because she was fucking awful.  There's no way that bus driver started the fight driving his route.  Some chick who walks on, he just starts fucking with it.  And guaranteed that didn't happen.  Yeah.  But I'm going to say that chick is tough as hell.  That is a tough chick.  That's why I was thinking she might have been hit already.  Like, she might know that mouthing off like that will get you hit.  She'd come back from a great punch. 
[02:01:30]  No, no, no.  Strong jawbone.  When she was talking, like, you knew this girl's been in a bunch of fights.  I knew she wasn't afraid.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I was amazed that she could take that.  That would have crumbled.  Dude, he threw off the bus physically by her hair.  Battering your fucking head.  He connected that snap sound and then throws her off the bus.  She comes right back poking at him, like trying to hit him again.  He just couldn't take this cunt mouthing off anymore and fucking touching him.  He was right to hit her.  Fantastic. 
[02:02:00]  I think that's okay to do if it's just a political disagreement.  You like that?  Yeah.  I saw a poll.  People saying Ryan did win the debate, Anthony.  Yeah.  Who's Ryan?  Paul Ryan.  Yeah.  The vice president came back then.  You guys watch that shit?  It's fucking hilarious.  I watched it because Biden was hilarious.  Biden was funny.  He had a shit-eating smile the entire time.  He was laughing.  He was laughing as Paul Ryan's trying to make real points.  That's why I watched it.  He's just an old-school politician.  Yeah.  Oh.  You voting, Bill? 
[02:02:30]  You don't vote.  No, no.  I do vote.  I don't vote for those guys.  But you vote for the other guys.  Yeah, I vote for the other guys.  Like local guys?  I'll vote for like a libertarian or I'll vote for the one rogue guy that his own party doesn't like.  I vote for those guys.  Gary Johnson, I think his name is.  Yeah.  Yeah, New Mexico.  I don't even know who I'm going to vote for.  I make my decision in the final couple.  I just go on.  In the booth.  No, not in the booth.  I just look at clips and I wait for that one guy who just sits there going like,  you know, these goddamn bankers.  You know?  That's my man. 
[02:03:00]  You know, these corporations have made a lot of money off this war.  But the guys who say stuff like that, I'm like, all right, here's a guy who's actually  sort of in the ballpark of what's going on as opposed to thousand points light, trickle  down, everybody, applesauce and health insurance for everyone.  Everybody must do their share.  You know, I think America is a great country.  And the founding fathers.  You're going to fucking sit there and watch that for nine hours as they sit there.  And when somebody gives them a great jab in the debate, then you do that fake laugh. 
[02:03:30]  Somebody just trashed you.  And rather than being like, this motherfucker, having that look on your face, you'll have to  be like, oh, and you take off your pen going, fuck, how many more minutes?  You start jotting something down on that legal pen.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  He got me a good one.  I only saw a couple of clips of the Obama one.  And I think he literally approached that debate like, Jim, you ever go and audition for something  and you're like, I don't want to get this.  I just need the reps.  Every single thing I've ever auditioned for, apparently.  It's like some, you know, some pilot that has stars like a horse. 
[02:04:00]  And you're like, there's no way this thing's going to get picked up.  So you just kind of go in there and half-ass it.  You know, you don't care if you don't get a call back.  That was his vibe.  Like, almost like, you know what?  Four years of this insurmountable mess.  You want to pick it up and say, hey, these are my wars and I'll fucking solve it.  It's unsolvable.  You need bloodshed to turn this one around, people.  That's what I said earlier, yes.  Bloodshed.  You're right.  Yeah, which isn't going to happen.  Well, what's going to happen is the bloodshed will be people in the streets. 
[02:04:30]  Rather, no, you need to go over the gates of the gated communities.  You need to get those people.  And that's where the bloodshed needs to be.  With their $4,000 napkins around their neck.  Yeah.  Looking up from some type of special crab that you didn't even know existed.  Well, when you...  The Illuminati shellfish.  I was saying, though, when you get some, you know, the idea of protesting and revolution in this country  is yelling that a police officer put pepper spray in your face and put a zip strip around your hands. 
[02:05:00]  And that is the worst possible thing that could happen to people.  They need to know that real, true revolution comes in the form of people getting their heads cracked open,  blood in the streets.  Oh, no.  It's bad.  It's bad.  Like, yeah, all those lives are already lost.  And then you kind of gave everything.  But, like, all those sweatshop labor.  Yeah, yeah.  People used to protest, you know, get killed.  Literally, they would bring in the army and they would shoot them.  And then eventually they're like, all right, I guess we have to pay you minimum wage. 
[02:05:30]  But then, I mean, this is all just from some fucking idiot here.  But I feel like unions literally became what they were fighting.  Yes.  Because, like, my image when I think union, especially doing some theaters,  is just somebody just sitting there in a fucking chair and just being like,  well, you know, yeah, you've got to have 19 guys to handle the stage.  Getting a huge amount of money.  Yeah.  And doing what you said.  They don't have the fucking decency to just, well, go hang in the back.  I don't want to see you.  Yeah, yeah.  They just sit there.  I shot in Cleveland and nobody shoots in Cleveland. 
[02:06:00]  And that cock-sucking union rep, it's like, first of all,  they weren't that good because they don't do too many shoots there.  And I had to do just a quick lighting thing for my clothes.  And the guy's like, yeah, we've got to get the guy down from the rig.  And then Ryan Pulido, the director, was being very nice.  He goes, could you just give it a couple more?  Because the lighting cues, the guys weren't doing anything right.  Yeah, you weren't ready yet.  And this fucking cock-sucking hunk of shit union, man, just wouldn't bend.  And it's like, that's why nobody wants to shoot in your fucking city. 
[02:06:30]  That's why.  Because it wasn't we needed to take advantage of these guys.  Because they were just being unreasonable pricks.  And that's Bill's exactly right.  It's basically 95% of human beings cannot handle a position of power.  They just become assholes.  And like, not all my friends, but a lot of friends, you know,  wanted to get a state job or wanted to get a union job  for the specific reason is that they didn't want to work.  How is that?  I want a job where I don't have to work. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  It's like, well, become a comedian.  You know, what I'm doing is harmless.  I know somebody doesn't have to pay me.  And then I come out on stage and be like,  no, I'm only required to tell three jokes in 20 minutes.  Sorry.  Yeah.  And I just sit there with my legs crossed.  It really has become where they're what they were fighting.  They bully people into, you know, giving them more money.  They're not unbending for the most part.  But having said that, you got to, if you don't have unions,  you will have sweatshop labor. 
[02:07:30]  So it's just that, I don't know, it gradually people got,  they got spoiled.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But if you're not a union, if you're not doing a union job,  they'll stand outside and wreck it.  The giant rat.  Yeah.  The giant inflatable rat will be in front of your place.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They've become unreasonable.  Yeah.  You want to know why we're in Afghanistan?  Sure.  Because we were doing the politics thing there for a second.  And Mike needs to get in here.  Mike, go ahead, buddy.  We have Bill Byrne's studio, by the way. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, hey.  I want to tell you something right now.  I want to laugh when I watch people respond to this staged, fake theater  that we call the debates.  This thing is such a fraud.  This thing with Al-C-I-Ada and terrorism is getting long in the tooth.  And I wish somebody would just come out and say,  look, we're in Afghanistan for the opium, man.  Look it up.  AP Reuters.  It's there.  Just type in Army Cultivating Opium in Afghanistan.  You're running for office.  Bill would vote for you. 
[02:08:30]  Why do we need their opium?  No, no.  It's got to be something that's tethered to something I can relate to.  I don't know what the banking industry is.  Why do we need the opium?  Afghanistan produced 20% of the world's opium in the year 2000.  Now they're producing 97% of the world's opium.  The United States Army has a green thumb, man.  They're over there getting the money.  It's all about the money, the opium.  It's the opium, man.  Nobody wants to talk about this.  There's a reason nobody wants to talk about this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's just silly, sir. 
[02:09:00]  Why do we need so much opium?  Yeah.  The drugs make the world go around, man.  The drugs are what's making the police state possible.  You know, I'm a truck driver.  I drive around in their $70,000 outfitted Tahoe's all day, ripping people's cars apart on the  side of the road every day, all day.  I see it two dozen times a day.  It's sick.  It's sick.  This is such a fraud.  Sir, this is where I get confused.  How do I debate somebody who thinks that we're fighting in Afghanistan to take the opium? 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  And I don't understand why, if I don't like the debates, that that automatically means  that I'm this far down the rabbit hole.  That's the rabbit hole.  That's true, though.  Yeah.  That's the thing.  Like, yeah.  Like, conspiracy theory.  Like, I only get to a certain point.  And I don't sit here and think, yeah, the moon's made out of cheese.  Yeah.  This country came about through a conspiracy.  You realize that.  So, like, all conspiracy theory isn't, like, just, like, moronic thought.  That's right.  A bunch of guys got together.  They said, this England place, yeah, let's fucking kind of sever ties. 
[02:10:00]  And, yeah, you're right.  I understand that.  Yeah, if our founding fathers, if we lost that, they all would have been hung for treason.  That's true, yeah.  But because we won, they're considered, you know, revolutionaries.  The heroes.  Yeah.  Which they are.  Yeah.  Which they are.  I mean, as far as I'm concerned, my side of the story.  But, you know, over there in our jolly old England.  They're not quite heroes.  They're traitors.  Yeah, they're traitors.  They were.  They went against the queen.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  So, like, no, I'm, like, that guy, that's one of those guys, like, that's why I don't bring up conspiracy theory in bars.  Because you get.  Because that's the one that everyone, like, that's the guy everyone hears from. 
[02:10:30]  Well, that was like a bad movie.  Well.  Where it just went from one thing to another thing with no real plot points.  Well, no, no, man.  We got Big K, Stevie, in Chicago.  Stevie.  Oh, shit.  Just a second.  Let me turn off my.  This guy agrees with Mike, who's still on the line.  Hell yeah.  Okay.  So, basically, you know, Mike was kind of right.  You know, that's one component of it.  But, really, the big thing in Afghanistan is they're trying to break China's monopoly on rare earth minerals. 
[02:11:00]  These are basically things that go into the chips that run your cell phone, computers, and everything like that.  Rare earth minerals.  Afghanistan has a ton of rare earth minerals.  And shit that you can put in batteries, shit that you can put in computer chips.  What's that?  All this stuff is really hard to get out of the ground, and in all of the places except China.  Why is it hard to get out of the ground?  Just dig for it.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Well, here's the thing. 
[02:11:30]  I mean, like, there's.  Okay.  It's not our country.  For instance, in my coal pan and, like, central.  Let's go there with a shot of it.  Let's go there with a shot of it.  But it's hard to get it out of there because there's no supply chain.  But what about the opium?  Opium.  Opium is there.  I mean, like, that's, you know, an old school, like, reason to be there.  I mean, like.  So you're saying that the other guy is wrong.  He's totally wrong as a guy.  Oh, we are.  I mean, like.  If he's saying opium and you're saying minerals, that's not the same thing.  Well, the rare earth minerals. 
[02:12:00]  I've heard about the rare earth minerals.  Very valuable.  China does have a lot of them.  I mean, like China.  All right.  Listen, thank you.  I got to go to the soldier who really wants in on this.  Mike's still on the line, Josh, who's a soldier in the Army.  What's up?  Hey, Mike, you motherfucker.  You're going to tell me that I was walking around Afghanistan and had soldiers killed for fucking opium?  You cocksucking piece of shit.  Is that what you're telling me?  Hey, hey, I didn't ask you to go.  No fucking Afghani or Iraqi ever bothered me, asshole. 
[02:12:30]  Don't fucking try to get me.  I'm doing my fucking job, man.  I'm doing my fucking job living in this country.  I'm doing my fucking job living in this country.  This is great.  And you're telling me that my mission is to go.  Is this the Biden-Ryan debate?  You are a henchman for a bunch of corrupt politicians, you fuck, you baby killer.  That's what you want to do.  Oh, boo.  What a hack.  Oh, gay.  Boo, Mike.  What a hack.  Mike gay.  Boo.  Hey, do you know how you kill babies, you motherfucker? 
[02:13:00]  You don't need them so much.  Oh, fuck, Josh.  You just don't need them so much.  Josh, my baby killer.  Oh, boo.  Yeah, man.  Boo.  You know what?  This is like when cops say, oh, we want to protect the people every day.  You know what?  I never asked any fucking cop to take that job.  I bet you call 911 the second something happens to you or your family.  Who's going to protect you?  You know what I love about all of this?  Yeah.  Opium and minerals. 
[02:13:30]  How about that?  Like, how does he expect this, like, the opium guy, how does he expect for the soldier  to hear what he's saying if you come at him the way you're coming at him?  Right, right.  That's like, like, that's like a debate on the internet.  I'll tell you why, fuckhead.  That's like, like, like somebody is, at that point, is going to be open-minded.  Let me listen to this reasonable fellow.  Yeah.  Why don't you be like, listen, I respect where you're coming from, but I just feel that's  a better way to listen to it.  Have somebody listen to it. 
[02:14:00]  I'm trying to say you can't start your point with, let me tell you something, fuckhead.  Dude, everything on the fucking YouTube.  That's every argument.  You're right.  Yeah.  Every fucking.  You know what?  I got to listen to this guy.  Yeah.  You can't have an open statement like that.  I could have given him the benefit of the doubt.  Yeah.  Hey, can I, the truck driver, Mike, who doesn't ask the cops, so you would not call the police  if you were in trouble?  Fuck no, I wouldn't call the police, man.  Hell no. 
[02:14:30]  I live in Arizona.  We all carry without permits, man.  If you're unarmed in Arizona, there ain't no problems in Arizona.  I don't even have police in my neighborhood, man.  Cops don't even patrol my neighborhood.  We take care of ourselves.  We are our own police force when we're allowed to have fucking weapons.  Do you understand that?  This is Mikey's soundbite.  Yeah, it really is.  I like him.  We're our own police.  The army's got a green thumb.  Because he went right down, baby killer.  Baby killer.  How do you feel about the way they're handling immigration in Arizona aggressively? 
[02:15:00]  Hey, I say keep on trucking.  I don't care if there's immigrants here.  Who gives a shit?  We should all be lucky enough to go to the store and be able to get a loaf of bread and  a gallon of milk and some gasoline that doesn't cost 12 fucking dollars a gallon, man.  I don't care who wants to come here.  The problem in Arizona that people have with immigrants in Arizona is they don't want to  assimilate.  Don't come to Arizona and fly your ugly ass fucking Mexican flag, man.  You're here.  You risk your life crossing the fucking desert.  Once again.  Wait, hold on a minute. 
[02:15:30]  Let me ask you a question.  Let me ask you a question.  Why do you have any kind of an affiliation or loyalty to the American flag if our military  is just a bunch of baby killers and this country represents starting a war just to get opium?  Why would you feel any connection to the flag which would make you feel disconnected to  the Mexican flag?  I don't.  Our country's been hijacked, man.  Our country's been hijacked.  I'm loyal.  I love the Constitution.  That's what it's about.  This country is just a shell of what it used to be. 
[02:16:00]  It's, it's, it's, we've been hijacked by banking.  Yeah, the Jews.  That's what he's getting at.  No, he isn't.  What he's saying here.  Now, this, this part here, this, this little sliver here, this little sliver.  This little tidbit is, uh, enticing you a little bit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, that's one of the reasons why I don't watch the debates because I don't have money  to pay for an $8,000, uh, plate of fish and chips.  So I can get into one of those guys' ears.  Right, right.  Be like, yeah, listen, there's a dam that needs to be built.  And we, we would like to do that. 
[02:16:30]  My county needs.  We would like to do that and charge 10 times what it costs so I can get a dollar.  Yes.  Yeah.  But you, you know, opium guy, even if you make a valid point about something, you sound  like a lunatic when you just call up yelling that we're just fighting in Afghanistan for  opium.  And the soldier calls in and you yell, baby killer.  It's like, come on, what's that?  1967, dude.  That's just, you sound dumb when you do that.  Even if you're making a good point.  And you're acting like the soldier, like, made the call.  Some like, you know, some private in the army.  All right, we're going in Afghanistan on my say-so. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  I'll fix your baby bayonets.  Yeah.  And meanwhile, no one's ever said, like, the soldiers over there probably have an idea of  what it's about because they would be told, all right, look, secure this opium field.  Don't let anywhere near the opium.  Yeah.  But, you know, no soldiers are coming back and saying it's all about opium.  No one has said that but you.  You know what?  Let me tell you something.  Why don't you research the Pat Tillman death a little bit?  I know everything about the Pat Tillman death, sir.  Yes.  What seems to be odd about it?  Yeah, what's your angle on that? 
[02:17:30]  Pat Tillman got fragged in the face because he told his brother he was going to come back  and expose the whole deal with heroin.  The United States government couldn't afford to have their gold.  How do you know that?  Yeah, how do you know that?  Were you there?  Yeah, hey, hey, Mike.  Hey, Mike.  I'm going to go right across the street to the home of Special Forces and let him know  you said that.  How about that, buddy?  Oh.  I'm going to.  Bring it on.  Dude, Mike, how do you know that?  I want to know how you know.  How do you know the inside of the Pat Tillman death? 
[02:18:00]  I watched the two-hour program where they interviewed the family members and the brother.  That's how.  Okay.  I heard that from the brothers.  He was killed with the light pink.  Yeah, well, the family might, you know, have a personal, be personally vested in this thing  where, you know, they're looking for more of an answer than just friendly fire during  a firefight.  Right.  Uh, and, and if there's something that sounds like there, it gives a little more reason  to his death, they might grab onto that, even though it might not be completely accurate. 
[02:18:30]  You know?  The Pat Tillman got fragged in the face and then the coroner ends up dead in a mysterious  way when the coroner was going to say this isn't how he died.  Wait, what was the mysterious way?  Yeah.  Well, the coroner said that he got shot from, from 200 yards.  He was fragged at point.  But what happened to the coroner?  I don't know how the coroner died.  You said he died in a mysterious way.  Yeah, what's mysterious?  Because I'm saying that.  This is where conspiracy shit gets out of hand.  You just heard it was mysterious, so you're saying you're repeating mysterious.  If you're just repeating what you heard, say that. 
[02:19:00]  This is what you got to do with conspiracy people.  You don't allow them to just say stuff like that.  Why did he die in a mysterious way?  You said this.  They were bringing it up with a pulley through a window.  And, uh...  Why are you saying that?  Did he realize that a 200-yard shot was not very wrong?  You're not answering the question.  It's not far at all, yeah.  How did the mysterious...  I'm sorry.  Mike, how did the coroner die?  He died in a car crash.  That's not mysterious.  How is that mysterious?  Very mysterious.  My dad died in a car accident.  It wasn't mysterious. 
[02:19:30]  What are you getting at?  It's very mysterious.  Obviously, he knew something about fucking opium.  Tillman.  Conspiracy guy, how is that mysterious?  His single car accidents are kind of strange.  They're not that strange.  They happen.  All the time.  So common.  Was this guy a drinker, or did he fall asleep behind the wheel?  Was it an icy road?  Was he texting?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Okay, then.  Did he have shitty windshield wipers?  Hey, he said it.  He finally said it.  I don't know.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  So that means he didn't die in a mysterious way as far as you're concerned. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, it was a single car accident.  That's what conspiracy people do all the time.  That's what you've got to stop them.  That's why Ventura got so pissed off.  Just even Torn does that shit.  Always.  And they can't handle follow-up questions.  And all you do is go, what do you mean by that?  Meaning, you know, give me more info.  And they never have more info.  So he died in a single car accident.  And maybe it was mysterious, but this guy doesn't know.  He's just repeating something he said.  Someone said it was mysterious, and you repeated that, and now you're saying it's a single car accident.  I find nothing mysterious about that.  How about this, Ben?  How about this?  How about when the Soviets are in Afghanistan fighting the Afghanis? 
[02:20:30]  They're called Afghan freedom fighters.  And when the United States comes there, they're called Taliban.  Because, well, you know what?  The Japanese were our sworn enemy, and now they're one of our strongest allies.  As time goes by, alliance has changed, sir.  We're as full of shit as every country when it comes to defining our enemies and our friends.  Every country has self-interest, is self-centered, and defines in a positive way their allies, 
[02:21:00]  and in a negative way their enemies.  Every country is equally full of shit in that way.  From Baby Killer Jimmy.  Can you guys at least just admit that there's something fishy going on?  No, you can't downgrade from we're over there to get all the opium, and Pat Tillman knew it,  to, hey, can you guys admit there's something...  Oh my God, Tillman knew!  Yeah, I have a little suspicion all the time.  I don't believe what the government tells me. 
[02:21:30]  I believe everything the government tells me.  Of course not.  They have no motive to lie.  It keeps me happy and safe and warm inside to just believe the government.  But what Jimmy says is a good point.  From what you're saying to something fishy, that's a big fucking...  There's a lot of room in between those two.  Yeah, yeah.  Really downplayed his initial argument of Baby Killers and opium and Pat Tillman, too.  Something's fishy.  Let me ask you, Mike, and I'm not even shitting on you.  It's a fraud, man.  Terrorism is a fraud.  Mike, no, hold on, Mike.  Let me ask you a question.  Why do you automatically take the word of Pat Tillman's grieving family? 
[02:22:00]  That, to you, becomes absolute and the law.  But every report from soldiers...  Bill tapped out.  Bill's tapping out.  Every report from soldiers or whatever means nothing.  Yeah, no, it's just like it's nothing.  We've established this guy is just going to make giant statements that he can't support.  Yeah, but I'd still like to...  This is like watching a Van Halen drum solo.  No, don't you dare.  You try to hang in there.  Don't you dare drag.  Don't you dare drag, Alex Van Halen.  I used that one on the drummer. 
[02:22:30]  Fuck.  Maybe the guy from...  You like drum solos?  The outfield.  If they're done correctly, yes.  Who does it correctly?  Alex is one of them.  Really?  John Bonham.  Well, Bonham is amazing.  I love that fucking video you put up with that guy doing the double bass with the fucking  Tom.  He's making...  Oh, Mike...  Yeah, Mike Johnston.  Dude, that guy's sick.  That was fucking cool as shit.  He actually...  He's made a name as...  A YouTube drummer?  No, he's a drum instructor.  No, he's huge. 
[02:23:00]  I really don't know.  He's huge now.  But he just did one recently where he was going to do a drum track, he said, for the smooth  jazz artists.  And he goes, I know they don't like the term smooth jazz, but until you come up with another  term, that's what it's called.  And he goes, I actually like this music, dude.  And he's one of those rare guys that has this unbelievable level of chops, but then can  be musical with them.  Because a lot of guys who just sit there and they get their chops up, they become like  these...  They're just this robot.  Technical, yeah.  Yeah.  And he's not like that.  He's a phenomenal, phenomenal player. 
[02:23:30]  That double bass thing was so fucking cool, though.  It sounded like...  Mike'sLessons.com.  That guy, he's unbelievable.  That's pretty cool.  We lost both guys.  We started talking about drumming and they're like...  Good.  Creepy.  By the way, that guy right there gives a bad name.  That's the guy right there where they'll say, this is a conspiracy theory.  That's who they get defined by.  That's the face of conspiracy theory.  But it's fun to break those guys down.  It is.  Even though he's a very extreme case, the way they latch on to something, like if he had 
[02:24:00]  had valid, this is why I think that, this is why I think that, but with most conspiracy  theorists I've spoken to, they fall apart very quickly because they're throwing out  these emotional things.  All they do is pick and choose what suits their theories.  Yes.  It starts with a valid thought.  The valid thought is you know that on some level you're not being told the full story.  Right.  But then where it falls apart is that you research stuff from the other side of the globe in 
[02:24:30]  your underwear at your laptop, going to YouTube and watching like, and then you start watching  like, okay, let me, let me watch a documentary on this.  And it's in the whole, it's not a documentary.  It's an op-ed piece disguised as a documentary.  Documentaries are just supposed to present a subject and by the end you're supposed to  be, oh, maybe this, maybe that.  No, you're discounting what you don't believe in and you're putting as gospel things that  you want to believe and it doesn't matter. 
[02:25:00]  That bit I used to do is then everybody, everybody has their angle.  Both people who are saying, I believe what the government's saying and those who don't  and then everybody goes to, basically goes on the internet and goes to I'mRight.com, you  know, basically looks up shit that supports their argument and then they just sit there  screaming at each other.  And I know this because I did it.  Sure.  If you listen to this show fucking three, four years ago, that's where I was at and I just,  after a while I was just like, this is fucking stupid.  I still know, I still don't, you know, I still think, yeah, I get corporate guys and 
[02:25:30]  all them are the real people that, you know, that these guys who are running for office have  to basically suck up to.  And, but I mean, I don't sit there at this point and even remotely think that anything  that I'm thinking is the undeniable absolute truth.  Right.  You'd be silly too.  Everybody bats 500.  We bat 500.  Most reasonable people, right half the time.  Wrong half the time.  And it's like anybody that is so stuck on any ideology.  I'd be lucky if I'm hitting 225. 
[02:26:00]  But you know what I'm saying.  I'm eighth in the order.  Anyone fucking married to their ideology so hardcore, I believe what I believe, is a dumb  motherfucker to me.  Yeah.  Because that means they're good.  That's one thing I like about the fact that Obama sent troops when he said he wouldn't.  He didn't want to send those troops.  He didn't want to send 30,000 fucking people.  But somebody told him something and he figured it was best to do it.  He started up the convertible.  That's what it was.  I like the fact that he did it.  There you go. 
[02:26:30]  That's fucking great.  And then, by the way, that guy was just starting to say terrorism's a fraud.  Right.  If that would have gotten into the 9-11 shit, it just would have been a more dribble.  Because you know where he's going to go with every thought.  And that's what makes him boring.  A couple things really fast.  Lithium is what they're after, right?  That's the big mineral.  Lithium?  Dilithium crystals?  Yeah.  And then someone's like, why wouldn't the government just buy the rare minerals from  the Taliban?  They can make a really good deal with those guys.  You can't do business with the Taliban.  That's terrible.  But, I mean, why wouldn't you just buy it from the locals if it's that valuable? 
[02:27:00]  From the warlords?  Or work out some.  Like a good warlord.  We would have done what we usually do.  We would have said, all right, we'll build you a dam.  Right.  We'll do that thing.  And then we've got to be in charge of it.  Yeah, well, then we're there.  We're like a virus.  And then we get our base there to protect you.  We would have gone that route.  You're defaulting on your loan.  Now we've got to take possession of the dam we built you.  A lot of military guys checking in, too.  Dustin goes, Mike, you're full of shit.  We did this shit because pussy's like you won't.  Oh.  That's another great way to get non-people in the military to listen to your opinion. 
[02:27:30]  Pussy.  Hey, fuckhead, you don't have the balls.  Oh, now I see your point.  You know?  A fuckhead is the worst way to address somebody.  There's so many of them kind of make a point.  Even if that's their name, you shouldn't say it.  Mr. Fuckhead.  Yeah.  FH.  Keep it nice.  Keep it clean.  Well, we're going to break.  Bill Burr's here.  Bill, what are you promoting?  I know you don't come in here just to promote.  I'm promoting our book, Cheat, A Man's Guide to Infidelity, which is doing very well.  It's actually doing very well. 
[02:28:00]  We were up to number 44, and today, if we can keep selling the books, then we'll actually  be considered a hit.  It's actually 14th in parenting and relationships, 14th in humor.  Parenting.  Just can't break that 14th.  And then 18th in humor and entertainment.  I don't know.  They have a lot of subcategories, but it's definitely doing well.  Cheat, A Man's Guide to Infidelity.  You can get it in all the usual places.  That's the same way community colleges are number one or something.  Rank themselves, right. 
[02:28:30]  Number one in people wearing overalls to class.  Subcategories.  Subcategories, yes.  All right.  We're going to continue with Bill, and we've got Playboy Playmates next.  Oh, boy.  Don't they want to be in Playboy, these girls?  Yes.  Is that what the deal is?  Yes.  Oh, really?  They're not in Playboy, so maybe they will do a little something-something today.  Yeah.  Ba-da-da-ba.  Right?  Ba-da-da-boo.  You can see which one is the best.  Yeah.  You know how bad I want to go back in time just for one day?  Just to be the emcee. 
[02:29:00]  At a burlesque show?  Oh, fucking rim shots.  Would you be the drummer?  No, I want to be the guy standing up there in a tuxedo.  Yeah, but you like drums, too, though.  Ladies and gentlemen.  They come in, and they kiss me on the cheek, and I go, zowie, zowie, okay?  No.  Put on, like, 40 pounds, awful mustache.  No, ladies and gentlemen.  You're just a sweaty mess up there.  Dude, you could actually shoot that video in Dangerfields.  I was performing there last night.  Really?  Just they're still the same fucking red carpet. 
[02:29:30]  That's a tough room, man.  I used to love Dangerfields, man, but they don't protect the comics if you're being heckled.  Like, I didn't feel comfortable there, because no matter what an audience member does, their scene is right.  And that drove me fucking crazy.  Why would they do that?  I don't know.  It's a bad move.  Jim was the one who got me, like, Jim was the first guy from our generation that actually went in there.  Like, I went in there one time, and I just, it was like, it was like stuck in time.  And there was these fucking comics that you never even heard of.  And they went on in front of, like, three people. 
[02:30:00]  It was just bitter as hell.  And Norton started doing it, and he's going, you know, it's not that bad.  You get to do a half hour during the week.  You stay sharp.  You know, because Jim was one of those guys who, you know, wasn't trying to be the city guy.  He was doing both.  So I was like, that's a good point.  So I started coming down, then Correale, then Sherrod.  And then all of a sudden, there was a good moment for those guys in, like, the mid-2000s, early mid-2000s,  where they actually had a lot of young blood in there.  I do remember when you used to go to Dangerfields every night. 
[02:30:30]  I used to do four spots, seven spots.  I would do fucking, on Friday, I would do three Dangerfields, three Seller.  And on Saturday, I would do three Dangerfields and four Seller.  That's how I paid my rent for years.  Wow.  During the three years.  For years.  Yeah, man.  Dangerfields was great.  You do 30 minutes.  You work on your fucking act.  I remember Patrice breaking your balls.  He said, I just came back from Dangerfields.  He goes, who'd you go on after, Ruth Buzzy?  Which was, out of all the references, it was just the best one. 
[02:31:00]  It was the funniest one.  How was it?  How was the club when you did it?  It was actually great.  I mean, I went down there.  Rogel was down there.  It was still cool.  It was still cool.  But what was funny is, you know, I was yelling a joke, as I'm apt to do, because I don't know  how to write.  And the reverb is still too fucking loud.  Reverb is too loud.  Yeah.  It, like, echoes.  Oh, shit.  Start feeling like you're giving a speech.  I used to love that room, man.  Because it's pitch black.  It reminds me of the comedy store in L.A. 
[02:31:30]  And you have a piano on your right, and you put your drink on there, and you don't see  the audience, which I loved, because you have no idea how many people are out there.  Dude, you have no idea.  You'd hear smatterings of laughter, or a full...  Couldn't see their faces.  I loved not seeing them, because it forced you to fucking work on your material, and it  was great.  But then it got to a point where, no matter what happened, no matter how much heckling,  they wouldn't toss people.  And that was like, come on, man.  And I get it that you gotta let the audience, you want them in there.  But if someone's fucking ruining the show, and you're not gonna side with me, I can't 
[02:32:00]  go.  I can't do it.  Some of the legends who've been in there, like Johnny Carson used to go there before  The Tonight Show was out in...  Yep.  Oh, man.  In New York?  When they were still in New York?  Yeah.  No, they had a great story about him getting all hammered, and going up the street, belligerently,  like pushing people out of the way, and his car backing up First Avenue, going, Johnny,  come on, get in the car.  Get in the car.  It's going up the whole thing.  I actually found a picture the other day on the internet.  I can't even remember how I got to it.  And when Caddyshack was coming out, there's this great picture of Dangerfield, Ted Knight, 
[02:32:30]  Bill Murray, and Chevy Chase all sitting on stage, getting ready to promote the movie.  And they all still look like they looked...  Oh, in the movie.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man.  Rodney looked like a million bucks.  That's great.  Bill and Chevy are young, and Ted Knight had that great head of white hair.  Yeah, yeah.  They look like, you know, when he's tanned, back before skin cancer concerns, so he looked  like a movie star, man.  It was awesome. 
[02:33:00]  There's pictures of fucking Johnny at the table there.  There's pictures of Carson sitting in there.  There's pictures of every red fox.  They haven't changed anything inside.  No.  Which I kind of like.  I like that.  Pretty much the original shit from when those guys were in there.  Those little lampshade things.  They've had those...  I mean, that's what I love is what a nightclub used to...  Yeah.  Who's that?  Used to look like.  Let me see, Sam.  It's like the Goodfellas when they bring the table out with the telephone on it.  I can't...  Is that Darren?  Is that Darren?  Yeah.  Darren Bavacqua.  He's...  I haven't seen...  He's Tony's son.  And Darren, I kind of liked when he ran the club. 
[02:33:30]  Because I remember one time, I think it was Ben Creed got into it.  I haven't seen Darren in years.  But I think Ben Creed got into it with an audience member.  And it was a big fucking audience member.  And the audience member came out to confront Ben Creed.  Because Ben Creed said some dumb fucking mother.  And the guy said, my mother just died.  And he shoved Ben Creed.  And fucking Darren, who is not that big a guy, jumped in front of the guy and fucking  shoved him back and says, you don't touch my fucking comics.  And I would have loved him for that. 
[02:34:00]  Wow.  Like, he really defended Ben Creed.  Like, that made me love Darren forever.  He's also...  If you listen to Dice's The Day the Laughter Died.  Yeah.  And those...  The creepiest moments, you hear that one laugh in the back.  That's him.  Oh, really?  According to him, yeah.  That's what he said.  I think both of those were taped at Dangerfield's.  Wonderful.  All right, we should break, because we've got the potential playmates coming in.  All right.  All right.  We'll see you next.  All right.  How many years ago did Brad... 
[02:34:30]  Whatever his name is, Dye?  None.  I just wanted to play Sablon.  What's that?  None.  I just wanted to play Sablon.  Oh, okay.  Good.  I like Sablon. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, they're great.  What's with the words, though?  We can't talk over words.  Yeah, come on, Iraq.  I like the rejoiner loop.  He's never going to win.  We just tortured, Iraq.  We're the gals.  Yeah, we're the gals.  We're the young ladies.  The ladies.  We were just talking about that burlesque song that just makes you instantly horny.  Da-da-da.  I remember being a kid, and when you heard this music, you would get fucking horny.  Yeah.  All the sitcoms used it, like when some sexy thing was supposed to be going down. 
[02:35:30]  I just came in, and they always dressed like half like a bird.  It was always like...  Fucking feathers and shit.  You know, peacock-looking stuff.  Half like a bird.  They always just tease.  Yeah, yeah.  Pulling the gloves off real slow with their teeth.  The little glove.  The biggest blue ball sitcom ever was I Dream of Jeannie.  Yeah, yeah.  You're a master.  And it's just like...  Master.  I didn't even know what sex was.  It's like, he should be touching her.  Yeah, you knew...  Yeah, you knew there was... 
[02:36:00]  He should be doing something.  Rub up against her.  What is he doing?  He was like, Jeannie, Jeannie, stop.  Get in the bottle.  He's like, you...  Right.  You get like fucking frustrated.  Like a goddamn kindergarten.  Yeah, what was his problem?  Touch your boobie.  Do something.  J-Day.  J-Day.  What was his problem?  All she wanted to do was fuck.  Well, that was the whole...  He didn't want anything to do with it.  That was the original Sam and Diane.  How long can we keep this going?  Because the second...  Because they did eventually get married in the show,  and it was the end of I Dream of Jeannie.  Yeah, and he went in a bottle. 
[02:36:30]  That was it.  Banged her on all those giant pillows.  Yeah.  Burlesque girls had the greatest combat...  And you couldn't faze a burlesque girl.  I'd like to fuck you.  You couldn't handle this, honey.  Yeah, yeah.  Nothing fazed a fucking burlesque girl.  They were always a little too old and a little too weathered.  Yeah.  When you jump up on the stage, you grab her tits.  She's like, he's had one too many.  And just walks away.  Nothing fazes those chicks.  No outrage.  Old school, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A fan dance.  They're naked, just putting the fans in the right place.  Size 14, big doughy.  Yeah.  That was considered acceptable back then. 
[02:37:00]  Not anymore.  Now you're going to be like a little pixie.  Yeah.  She's in the dressing room afterwards with the lights around the mirror,  and the owner comes in.  Well, good job tonight, doll.  Thank you, honey.  Yeah.  Hey, where's Doris?  She's running late.  Smoking cigarettes.  With her Mr. Moody voice.  I got to do a second show tonight.  You know what's funny?  I was listening to the song The Wanderer came on.  Yeah.  Who am I kidding?  I have it on my iPod.  And I was listening to it, and just the names of the girls in there. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, yeah.  They're so old.  They're so old.  You got The Wanderer.  They're just old lady names now.  Yeah.  Mo on my left, and there's Mary.  No, there's Flo.  Flo.  Flo.  Mo.  Flo.  What was the last time Flo was?  Mo, Mo, Mo, Mo.  Hang on a second.  It's coming.  Yeah, yeah.  This one name is kind of all right.  I kiss him and I love him.  I really could have just told you the names.  No.  This is good.  This is good.  A lot of time.  It's anticipation.  Girls aren't here yet. 
[02:38:00]  Wow.  Hang on.  Coming around.  Coming around.  Yep.  Here we go.  I think here it is.  Pick up the names.  Listen to these names.  Oh, well, it's Flo on my left arm, and there's Mary on my right.  Flo, Mary.  And Janie is the girl.  Janie's okay.  Yeah.  And when she asks me, which one of the best?  I tear over my shirt, and I throw a Rosie on my chair.  That's a Rosie.  Rosie the Riveter.  Yeah, that Rosie the Riveter was hot, but now to me, Rosie the Riveter, I smell that 
[02:38:30]  old lady smell.  Bad old nylons.  Yeah, perfume covering the sign of slowly decaying flesh as the dying process has begun.  He had everything in there but blanche.  Yeah.  Mary's okay, too.  I don't mind Mary.  Flo's horrible.  Flo.  Flo's rough.  Yeah.  What's that short for?  Florida?  Florence.  Florence.  Yeah, Florence. 
[02:39:00]  That is an unsexy name.  Gertrude is a great one.  Gertie.  Mildred.  Mildred.  Millie.  Hey, Millie.  Ugh, Alice.  Was that ever sexy?  Yeah, at one point.  Yeah.  Yeah, fucking, oh, Millie, she's a fucking two-holer.  No, because you got, no, because they were like the newer hip names, like, you know,  all the dumb names people name their kids now.  Yeah.  Oh, wowee.  Gwendolyn, holy fuckaroni.  No, uh, no flows here today.  Holy fuckwad. 
[02:39:30]  These girls want to be, uh, playmates.  I guess so.  Oh, Jesus.  Playmates or, or, now, now, wait.  Is it Penthouse?  It's Lainey.  No, it's Playboy.  Oh, okay.  It's Playboy.  Playboy.  It's Lainey.  Oh, good.  That's classy.  Maybe Kenny will fucking throw the door into her head again.  Oh, my God.  Well, there's Brittany on my left.  Amber on my right.  Yeah.  When she yelled my back.  Who did it?  Girls.  I'll have to explain.  How you doing?  How you doing?  Look at this.  Morning.  Morning.  We never get pretty girls in here. 
[02:40:00]  This is amazing.  Yeah.  Who's the fella?  What the hell's this?  Hi, sir.  I'm hanging down there, dude.  That's the DJ.  Wait, you're going to talk?  I'm the DJ.  Are you talking?  The DJ's here.  Is he talking?  I don't know.  You talking?  I don't know what he does.  What do you do, man?  Hi, sir.  Well, you're in charge of Playboy casting?  Casting.  Oh, okay.  What a great gig that is.  Where did you get that?  Somebody has to do it.  Ah.  Jesus.  Hi.  So what's the vetting process? 
[02:40:30]  There's four very...  Where's your microphone, madam?  I don't know.  I work with him.  I was going to say...  Oh, you work?  Oh, boy.  She looks like she's a maid guy already.  She's a maid guy.  She's a maid guy.  I'm maid.  Yeah.  You can't screw with me.  I'm maid already.  Oh, this is what this is.  Okay, Playboys, they're coming here to New York, and they're going to hold open casting calls  October 15th through 17th, and if you want to possibly post for Playboy, or at least,  you know, audition, go to Playboy.com and click on Casting Call Schedule. 
[02:41:00]  Wow, that's cool.  I love that the curtains just got closed like something's going to happen.  That is really...  You could open these curtains up and parade preschoolers in front of here.  Sure you do.  No, that's good.  So you all want to be in Playboy.  Are you competing with each other?  You can get up to the mics.  I guess so.  How does that work, Sam?  Are they competing with each other?  No one's really competing with each other.  It's kind of, you know, if they look great, they all get a chance to do it, so it's not  really a contest.  You know, it's just kind of, you look good, you get to do it.  And what are we looking for here?  For Playboy, you know, all around, just good-looking girls. 
[02:41:30]  Poise?  Poise.  We like poise.  There's got to be a certain level of class, though.  Are we looking for some pink?  There's got to be a certain level of class, right?  They definitely have to be classy.  Yes, yes.  Tattoos okay or no?  You know, some tattoos.  Not sleeved and, you know, gangstered out or anything like that.  Tramp stamp?  Is that still acceptable or is that...  Who's even getting those anymore?  Tramp stamp?  Any girls?  You got tattoos?  They're old school now, right?  You got one.  You got one.  I have one on my leg.  All right.  That's not bad. 
[02:42:00]  Just get to that.  You have one on your leg?  What's your name?  What is it?  Jessica.  Jessica.  Well, there's Jessica.  Oh, you got a koi fish.  I haven't seen many koi fish tattoos.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Me and my sisters all have koi fish.  Oh.  Oh.  What do your sisters do?  They're younger than me.  Are they?  School.  Oh, I mean.  Nice.  Well, how old are you ladies?  I'm 25.  25?  That's nice.  24.  Oh, yes.  And Miss on the end? 
[02:42:30]  Hi, Miss.  What's your name?  I'm 22.  Are you shy?  No, I'm not.  I'm just confused with the whole microphone situation here.  Just hold it and talk into it.  Why are you confused?  Yeah, it's easy.  Yeah, it amplifies your voice.  It's incredible.  There's three of us and four microphones, so we have to share.  No, no.  If there's three of you and four microphones, you don't have to share.  Oh, good God.  There's four of us and three microphones.  I vote for her.  It's my worst nightmare.  That's perfect.  This is my worst nightmare.  I've been up since 4 a.m.  I'm sure you guys have been up earlier than that.  Yes, Opie has a brand new daughter, so this is actually a source nightmare. 
[02:43:00]  Congratulations.  So, you girls, obviously, you do some modeling, all of you, right?  Yes.  Yeah.  Is that like the main gig?  What kind of modeling?  Yeah.  No, not main gig.  No.  No?  Part-time.  No.  Part-time?  Why?  What do you do?  Why part-time?  Are you just a regular job working girls?  J.Crew model?  No, I hustle.  You hustle?  Yeah, I work like two jobs, full-time student, model.  What are your jobs?  I do promotional modeling.  I work with kids with special needs. 
[02:43:30]  Aw, Jimmy.  Yeah, I know.  I'm like all over the place.  Aw, you're just like a nice person.  That is very good.  See, so you're a nice person.  What have you modeled for?  Um, I've done Playboy before, actually.  Oh, you have?  Yeah.  So why do you need to come back around, then?  You should be like...  Yeah, you're already in Playboy.  Yeah, aren't you like already...  Can you just go look?  Here I was two weeks ago.  Yeah.  She did one of the shoots a while ago, so now she's going to come back to do some of  the other stuff.  There's lots of stuff to do with Playboy from like...  But they won't just rehire you?  They have to go through the whole process again?  Well, I think it was, what, a year?  It was like two years ago.  Two years ago? 
[02:44:00]  If it's within six months.  Is she coming back from an injury or something?  Is she coming back from an injury?  Yeah, you're rehabbing?  No, I'm not.  You pull a hammy?  She's going to make it back into the big leagues.  What do you do?  I work in the Lower East Side at Beauty and Essex.  Cocktail waitress.  Cocktail waitress.  Yes.  I bet you do very well, right?  Not too bad.  Get a lot of, hey, honey.  There's some tips.  Yeah, that's very good.  And what about you, dear?  I just went back to school, but before that, I was working in finance. 
[02:44:30]  Finance?  Finance.  You were dealing with figures?  But you couldn't figure out the microphone thing?  There's three of us.  Oh, thank God.  I'd hate to have her do my books.  That's why I had to get back to school.  Shoot out, you had me paying 108% in taxes.  Wow.  What kind of finance did you used to do?  I was trading short-term fixed income.  Short-term fixed income?  What does that mean?  I don't know that.  It's money market stuff.  Okay.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:45:00]  That's kind of not much going on there.  Did you do well with the market?  Did you lose a lot when the market crashed?  What?  Well, I was 18 when the market crashed.  Ah, see that opening?  That didn't really affect me.  Don't worry about that.  But interest rates are really low, so that affects money market stuff.  Yeah, that's money market stuff.  Not a whole lot of money in there.  That's like, Jesus, it's the banks.  It is.  It is.  Yeah, yeah.  That's money market stuff.  That's easy.  It's just 0.001%. 
[02:45:30]  That's all you make.  It's crap.  Have any of you ever posed naked before?  You obviously did Playboy.  Have you ever posed naked before?  Tastefully nude.  What's the difference?  I guess if you don't show the pink, it's tasteful, right?  Well, if you don't show the pink, it's tasteful.  And you have to be like some sort of nature kind of thing.  It's got to be very nature-like.  It's got to be like a tree there or something.  Yeah, yeah.  That's pretty good.  Your nudity's got to be sort of by accident.  That can't be like a leather couch and like nothing else in the room. 
[02:46:00]  It's got to be like a whoopsie.  It's got to be like a whoopsie.  Yeah, like, oh, I didn't know the cameras were here.  Oh, what happened here?  Oh, my God.  I'm just getting out of the shower.  This is weird.  I was just holding flowers.  What happened to me?  I'm dumping water over my leg out of this old pitcher.  Right.  Oh.  Hanging up laundry on a clothesline outside.  Right.  I'm gathering flowers in a basket.  Right.  Nude.  Yeah.  What's this?  Where's Hustler?  They have you in stirrups.  With a fucking spotlight on it. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, my God.  Scratch and sniff.  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.  So, you girls, you're not uncomfortable with the thought of nudity at the end there?  No, I've also modeled for Playboy before.  Oh, you have.  What was it with service?  Yeah, what issue?  The girls in finance?  A lot of issues there.  Actually, I did a couple of things that I came out this summer in a college edition. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah.  Special editions.  It was like college?  I think they're discontinuing them.  The girls of kind of a thing?  The girls of kind of thing is going to be online now, Playboy.com.  Oh, really?  They're discontinuing what?  Well, special editions is all going to be on Playboy.com.  It's because the magazine industry is taking a beating, right?  Well, there's the main magazine, which is always going to be there, but special editions is now.  Anyone meet Hugh Hefner in this room before?  Sam, you meet Hugh Hefner?  Of course, at the Playboy Mansion.  Yeah, is he cool?  Yeah, he's a nice guy.  Do these girls meet him yet?  Have you guys met him yet?  Meet Hef?  Kimberly has. 
[02:47:30]  You haven't frolicked in the grotto?  No frolicking in the grotto yet?  Oh, you'll get there, I'm sure.  And if you're lucky enough to hold his old man balls.  Jeez, Opie.  Opie!  That's not a very nice question.  They, you know, aspire to become.  Very nice.  Pay him now.  Sorry, I apologize.  Opie gets a little rambunctious at times.  Yeah.  So, are you looking for this to put you over the top and you stop working or, you know, stop tending bar or whatever else? 
[02:48:00]  That's like everyone's wish.  Is it?  Yeah.  What can this lead to, sir, for these girls?  Well, doing Playboy, I would say, you know, once you're a Playboy model, everyone wants you to be in their commercial, their TV show.  They want you to host parties.  Sure.  They want you to model for their other magazine TV stuff.  Who's the latest person who's broken out of Playboy and gone on to that level of stuff, would you say?  Who's your latest RG3? 
[02:48:30]  I mean, Jacqueline Swedberg, who's a Playmate of the Year 2012.  She's now, I mean, doing all kinds of stuff.  So, I mean, I'm sure she'll be out there pretty big soon.  She's Playmate of the Year right now.  And there's lots of stuff.  Can we see her picture?  Well, do you guys have a picture?  I'm sure it's online somewhere.  Yeah, it's online.  You can Google her for sure.  Jacqueline Swedberg.  Mars, why don't you?  Mars.  Oh, Mars doesn't even know how to work a computer.  He's Hispanic.  It's not a touchscreen, Mars.  He's touching the screen.  He's Hispanic.  He doesn't know how to fucking spell her name.  Oh, gee. 
[02:49:00]  I don't know.  What are you, Italian?  Puerto Rican and Irish.  Puerto Rican and Irish.  That makes Italian.  That's amazing.  It's like an alchemist.  A little French.  A little French.  A little Native American.  Oh, wow.  Oh, you know what that means, right, Jimmy?  Jimmy knows.  I love Native American women.  Oh, why, Jim?  Just like they have very nice cheekbones.  Is that what it is?  Yeah.  High cheekbones.  And what else?  They have a great heritage and they're very sexy.  Jimmy, what else?  Great heritage.  Women.  Jimmy has talked about Native American women. 
[02:49:30]  I remember something, but I can't remember what it was.  It was something about...  I have a...  Something.  I like women who have certain type of genitals.  Like, oh, Jesus.  Puffier or larger.  And Native American women happen to have that quality.  Wow.  That seems like they're really...  Putting people in a niche?  They're a...  Oh.  I know.  That's a giant...  Puffy labius.  Jesus, guys.  Jesus, guys.  Jesus, where are we going with this?  Bill's actually furrowing his brow line and going, Jesus, guys. 
[02:50:00]  Guys, guys, come on.  I don't know.  That's true.  We just got to step it up.  There's some bad young...  There's young ladies in the room.  Oh, wow.  She's the Playmate of the Year.  Wow.  That's different.  He usually likes the blondes.  Yeah, that's a good choice right there.  That's good.  That's good for the brunettes there.  Yeah, it gives them some hope.  Every once in a while.  Every once in a while.  Doing all the Playboy TV shows and stuff like that before becoming a Playmate.  Oh.  Jimmy doesn't like girls.  That's why he left.  Where did he go?  He can't be bothered with girls.  Did he get a phone call? 
[02:50:30]  Oh.  So when do we find out, like, what these girls, when they're going to be in the magazine,  if they...  Well, the casting is next week, 15th, 16th, 17th, at the W during the day.  So they all come in.  They do a little...  They all come in.  How many are there?  I mean, there'll probably be a couple hundred girls.  Wow.  It's just like American Idol, where, you know, there's people who can't even sing, and you  have, like, people coming in who are just train wrecks.  We used to do it like that.  And they're like, I know I look good.  Right.  And they're there just be the goof.  We used to do open calls where everyone could just sign up, they come in, and there was the 
[02:51:00]  American Idol type thing where those girls show up.  But now...  And how did you handle it?  Listen, sweetheart.  You ain't got what it takes, see?  You don't have what it takes.  There's different rooms for the girls to go in and audition.  It's like, you know, maybe certain rooms will have a good girl, stuff like that.  But now we're kind of screening everybody.  You're the ugly bitch room?  Oh, Bill, Jesus, where are we going here, Bill?  I wonder if they all looked around and kind of realized it, like...  You know, somebody's so arrogant, oh, I'm winning this shit. 
[02:51:30]  Is this the best they could come up with?  One door leads back to the street, the next door leads to the next room.  Yeah, it's very good to know, see?  You're giving these girls a little hint.  If you're in the room and you look around and everybody else is ugly.  Right.  They'll all be in the hot girl room.  Have you seen these girls naked?  I've seen these two, but not the center one.  Oh, wow.  My voice sounds like when my dog is, like, really excited and wants to treat or something. 
[02:52:00]  Reminds me of that.  It's really making me homesick.  I mean that in a good way.  He likes your voice is what he's saying.  That was a compliment.  Wow.  So what do you have to do?  You guys got to do some sort of, like, don't you got to do, like, shit with, like, hula hoops?  There's got to be some sort of, like, and have, like, an opinion on, like, Afghanistan or something so you can see that you're, like, well-rounded. 
[02:52:30]  No talent competition.  Is anybody like, you already got, you work with special needs, so you got the whole, all right, I'm hot, but I still care about humanity.  So what do you bring into the table?  Like, how do you care?  What do you do?  Is there a homeless guy you sing to who cries into his newspaper bed before you go off to fame and fortune?  I mean, I like sports, so I'm, like, relatable.  There you go, sir, guys.  There you go.  Yeah.  I'm real.  I'm not going to be humanitarian.  You're like Jenny from the block, right?  Because I'm real on the downtown six. 
[02:53:00]  And what about you, there?  You're saying you're real.  You're saying you're real, so you're saying I don't do any of this phony, nice person shit.  I just like sports and guys like because I know sports.  I like that.  I play Madden, and, you know.  I like that.  You play Madden.  How about you?  You could actually go out there and talk about what's trending in the economy, right?  Yeah.  Where do you think we should invest our money, just the four lugs over here?  Yeah.  Well, my personal opinion is to wait until after the presidential election to invest in anything, 
[02:53:30]  because the markets are really in turmoil right now.  Who do you think is going to win?  I don't know.  I know who I hope wins.  Oh, who do you hope wins?  Mitt Romney.  I'm a Republican.  All right.  There you go.  And I want a job when I get out of school again.  Yes.  All right.  So what, like, do you do any, like, humanitarian stuff?  I think girl number one cares for her.  Like, will you do something, like, if you see, like, if you see five homeless people, 
[02:54:00]  will you bring six apples and say, I'm sorry, there's not enough for everybody?  Bill, you're right.  Actually, I prefer not to work with people so much when I do charitable things, but I do work with children.  And also, my passion is for working with animals, because they're defenseless.  Oh, see, that's sweet.  There you go.  They didn't create the situation that they're in.  Yeah.  So your animals, you're saying? 
[02:54:30]  George W. Bush did.  But what kind of animals?  What kind of animals?  What kind of animals do you like?  Dogs, cats?  Dogs and cats.  Cats are my favorite, actually.  Why do you like them?  Because they're kind of independent and shitty and...  No, every cat I've ever had is actually really friendly, like, kind of like a dog, except  for the shit in their litter box, and you don't have to worry about shit on the floor, and  you can leave them for, like, a couple days if you need to go somewhere.  For real noise, right?  You like an independent. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah.  Dogs are like having a kid.  And she never does.  I like to visit other people's dogs.  I'm not on my own.  That's an awesome, awesome girl.  So, any boyfriends, you girls?  Yes.  Huh?  Yeah?  No.  No?  No.  Why?  Are you difficult to get a lot of?  No, because, you know, guys are intimidated, and they're afraid to approach you.  Is that what it is?  Yeah.  Probably too good-looking to be approached.  I guess so.  I don't...  The dating scene in New York is really hard. 
[02:55:30]  I'm from Connecticut, so it's a lot easier, but, I mean, everyone's so fast-paced that I  just don't think anyone really has the time to, like, stop and get to know someone.  Who do you usually meet down in the thing?  You must meet a bunch of Wall Street guys.  Uh, business people.  Ah, yeah.  Those privileged kids, you know.  A lot of hipsters.  Do you hate them?  You like hipsters, and no?  I like to hang out with them.  Right.  But you don't want to sleep with them?  No.  Do you find them sexually repulsive?  Because they're soft, fruity nature.  And they're too concerned about the environment.  And those stupid pork pie hats. 
[02:56:00]  And their legs are skinnier than yours.  Right.  It's got to be annoying when they can fit into your stretchy pants.  You hate when a guy's white t-shirt and, like, they see this pork pie hat,  and he's like, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you.  And you're like, that's exactly what I wanted, stupid.  I understand.  Big corner of glasses, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You need a guy in kind of terrible shape who dresses terribly for work.  I like a little meat on the bones.  Cool.  I meant myself.  Oh.  I like a little meat on my bone, too.  See? 
[02:56:30]  That's a fuck joke, I think.  So, what's happening here?  So, what is it?  What is it?  What's going on, man?  What exactly is it that?  Let's pull up this clip.  Yeah, sure.  What?  The, um...  All right.  Yeah.  There you go.  Remember that?  Okay.  All right.  So, God, no boyfriends.  Yeah, let me find that.  None of you?  No, I have a boyfriend.  You have a boyfriend.  Oh, okay.  For like eight years.  Eight years?  How old are you?  And he has no problem?  24.  He has no problem with your nakedness.  How old is he?  No.  23.  Oh.  What?  A younger?  A younger guy? 
[02:57:00]  Yeah, I mean, I've been with him since, like...  You were 16, he was 15.  Oh, man.  You know how great it'd be if she said he was 40?  Yeah, that'd be great.  Oh, God, guy's a creep.  45.  Yeah, I love him.  Well, creep is all relative.  So, now, what are we promoting today?  Let's be real here.  Weird voices and, um...  No, no, no.  You've got to go down to...  Oh, yeah.  Where are you going, Sam?  People are actually...  This isn't a closed event, is it?  Well, it is.  It's a...  Oh, crap.  I want to see hundreds of girls.  Oh, wait a minute.  I mean, there is going to be hundreds of girls, but...  Why don't you have, like, a celebrity kind of sit-in, like Jim Norton? 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, Jim Norton, yes.  He could help with the...  You could judge the girls there.  Yes.  He's good at that.  Jim loves judging people.  He's really good at that.  I can't be mean to girls.  I'd find something nice on all of them.  Like, ah, your ears.  So good.  You'd be like the Paul Abdul on the show.  Right.  Yeah, okay.  I just keep always finding the positive.  Oh, wait, hold on.  Now, they're casting attractive females, five foot even to 5'11".  What?  Natural or enhanced.  No one likes a five foot or enhanced.  Now, do you mean their height enhanced, like, will take you even if your legs are not yours? 
[02:58:00]  Yes.  Like, metal Lieutenant Dan legs.  Those are my fake breasts.  It's titanium, like they use on a space shuttle.  Yeah, my fat wife, Susan.  Minimal tattoos.  Of course, in shape, model type, and the girl next door.  18 to 28 ethnicities, all are welcome.  And the Playboy model rates are $500 a day for Playboy.com shoots.  Righteous bucks.  And the conceptual or theme shoots are $1,000 a day. 
[02:58:30]  Oh, what are conceptual or theme shoots?  And hold on, $25,000 for a playmate.  Yeah, what is a conceptual or theme shoot?  So, there's special shoots where maybe, you know, it's a theme.  Maybe it's like Star Wars theme, you know, for example.  I don't think we're doing Star Wars, but something like that.  Well, that's kind of a cool thing.  Playmate's only made $25,000?  I thought it was more.  But is that Playmate of the Year or the Playmate of the Month?  No, Playmate of the Month is $25,000.  So, it's Playmate of the Year.  $25,000 large?  $100,000.  Not too bad.  A little bit more.  $100,000?  Girls could use some of those dollars, right? 
[02:59:00]  That's like NFL cheerleaders make like $4 a game.  Yeah.  I'm not even joking.  And then I want to talk to the players.  But they don't get naked, I guess.  Yeah, yeah.  The naked thing really kicks the price up.  Yeah.  If you guys stand outside, it's like $30,000 below in a skirt.  Any girls?  I fucking cheer for a team that's down $17,000 and fucking $3,000 at halftime.  Should we get naked now?  Any girls enhanced?  None of you girls are enhanced?  That's good.  That's pretty good.  I prefer natural to enhanced.  So, we brought the natural.  That is good.  That is good.  There's something to be said for that. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  I think that's kind of dying out, this whole enhanced thing.  There's an obsession with big breasts.  But the tattoo thing is becoming more acceptable.  Back in the day, if you had a tattoo, you'd have to throw you out on your ass.  Yeah, you were trash.  Sure.  Trash girl.  Biker chick or something.  No, no.  It's not like that at all.  No, no.  Now it's completely accepted.  It's a whole new world, Anthony.  Totally is.  I've seen.  Well, it's like a male earring thing.  At one point, it was considered very crazy and rebellious, and then it just kind of became  what people did.  It became gay.  It was considered gay at one point.  If you had an earring, you were considered a best.  And your right ear. 
[03:00:00]  Left ear.  No, no.  Left ear was acceptable.  Right ear was gay.  Right ear was gay.  Oh, no.  No wonder you're confused.  Oh, no.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  No wonder.  Oh, and you were wondering why men were always coming up to you back in the day.  I got earring holes in my left ear.  All right.  What about body?  You know, I don't know.  What about body grooming?  I got earring back in the day.  Oh, that's hilarious.  I bet you had that fucking Billy Idol one hanging down with a lightning bolt.  No, I just went with the diamonds.  Nothing.  And a tiny little gold hoop, if you care.  You should get a bush. 
[03:00:30]  I like that.  You got a full bush.  Just kidding.  No, I'm kidding.  Nice.  But don't you find that pubes are kind of making a little bit of a comeback these days?  A little bit?  See?  No.  Sir?  No.  No, I'm not saying whether you like it or not.  I'm saying this seems to be the trend.  It went from, like, the Hitler mustache, the landing strip kind of a thing, and then  it went to clean shave.  Every girl would clean shave.  And now, it's kind of coming back around where people are growing a little back.  Yeah.  A little bit.  I don't know.  That would be nice to hint towards some sort of legal. 
[03:01:00]  Thank you.  It's like a legal aspect to it.  Yes.  It's like a Van Halen comeback, though.  It's kind of not happening.  Exactly.  I'm not talking about a big Sammy Hagar head of hair.  But they're trying to come back.  I want to be able to snort coke off the top of it.  I want nothing in the way.  Well, I know what you want.  I'm saying what the trend is.  You might be hard-pressed to find.  But the girls are telling you no.  We've got four girls.  All are cleanly shaven.  Clean shaven, totally.  I don't buy it.  I need proof.  Ah!  Look at Billy.  That's a great one.  Trying to steer it. 
[03:01:30]  Trying to steer it into the sun.  Bring it into the light.  Sam, are we going to see some nudity here?  I don't know.  I'm just asking.  I don't know.  Who's ready first?  We'll start with the little one first.  Yeah, well, how about a little music?  Let's get the music so people can feel comfortable.  They want the burlesque music?  Instead of having five creepy old guys going, okay.  Yeah.  It really is.  You're on the right.  We should be sitting in the dark with flashlights.  Somehow it was so much different.  We're all like the Colonel in Boogie Nights.  I hear you've got a giant cock on you. 
[03:02:00]  Colin Quinn does the best Colonel in Boogie Nights face.  Yes.  You've seen him do the smile.  And his forehead that kind of lifts up.  He's got the right age.  Maybe we should turn on some of these lights so it's not as intimidating.  As lecherous and creepy.  Holy fuck, man.  We're harmless.  We're so harmless.  Not that fucking dark, you psychopath.  We can't see him.  Iraq has it pitch black.  All right, good.  Thanks.  Okay.  Kim, can you pick who goes first?  Well, maybe everyone should just get in their lingerie first.  Oh, that'd be nice.  Yeah, that's it.  Kim actually raises a valid note. 
[03:02:30]  Lingerie.  Let's get down to our lingerie.  Yes, lingerie would be nice.  And then we're going to play a little game.  This is great because we get like a sneak preview of these girls that are going to be  with a bunch of other girls.  But these seem better because they're going to be in there.  Fucking Iraq's face.  Oh, Iraq.  I didn't even know what's going on.  He's just like, yeah.  Iraq.  Yeah.  We should kick him out.  I'm joking.  He was standing there thinking of his wife.  I'm sorry.  You're all creepy, Iraq.  You're creeping everyone out with your stare.  No, he isn't.  Yeah, it's the fact that you haven't shaved since fucking September 8th. 
[03:03:00]  No, you know what it was?  It was like a cartoon.  All of a sudden, Iraq just saw a pork chop.  Oh, man.  Wow.  Sorry, Iraq.  Didn't mean to blow up your spot there, man.  Girls got nice bodies.  Yeah, they're very lovely.  They're slipping down to their underpants, which I'm a big fan of.  This is not quite.  I mean, it's beautiful.  They're beautiful.  But it's weird how they're undressed.  How they're undressed.  But that's the beauty of them. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  They ask them to get undressed.  They just do.  Very, very locker room.  I'm like, yes.  It seems to be.  That's what I said.  Do we have any music?  Yeah, let's get some music on.  I think they're going to do a striptease.  It does seem like a pile of clothing should be left outside the chamber.  You know those drug movies where they have the people work for them.  You've got to be completely naked.  They look like they're getting ready to do a shift.  Man.  You are all deceptively hot.  Like, in the clothes you're wearing, you couldn't tell how fucking fantastic they are.  Oh, wow.  You're not enhanced.  Turn the music up. 
[03:04:00]  That's beautiful.  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  Whoa.  She has a tiny little hiney.  Do I win it even for going to win your prize?  Wow.  Speak into the microphone, please.  Please.  Someone got a prize.  You've got to speak into the mic.  Yeah, into the microphone.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe she hasn't yawned yet.  That is amazing.  It just sounds like she's going to yawned, and she never does.  Wow.  Look at all these shit.  Don't even.  Your ass is amazing.  What do you mean you're a little different?  Let me see.  No, don't worry about that.  It's beautiful. 
[03:04:30]  She's got the small movies.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Wow.  Yes, you should.  That will differentiate you.  That will differentiate you.  Yes.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  These are three amazing-looking girls now.  Yes.  Wow.  Look at that.  Yes, the trooper.  Got topless.  Very good.  Got topless.  You're going to do very well.  Don't worry.  It's beautiful.  You're going to be beautiful.  Very small boobs.  Oh, man.  B-cups are perfect.  I know.  If you had them. 
[03:05:00]  Don't worry about it.  Do you have A-cups or smaller Bs?  No, I definitely have A-cups.  Yeah?  So do I.  These girls, but I got to ask me.  Oh, don't even worry about it.  Don't worry about it.  Can we see your hiney?  I'm trying not to be lecherous.  You're doing a hard job.  Oh, my God.  There's a little kiss.  Is that a tattoo?  Yeah.  Oh, that's so nice.  Wow.  Her hiney is a tattoo.  I don't know how to describe it.  Fucking nice.  And she has like a little...  I'm Puerto Rican.  What do you expect?  No, no, please.  I say that with all due love.  It has a beautiful little kiss tattoo on it. 
[03:05:30]  Not like the band.  No, that would be so creepy.  Right, it would.  If it was just four fucking heads breathing fire into her anus.  That's perfect.  The little lips.  Oh, my God.  I saw the worst fucking tattoo ever when this is over.  Okay.  I'm going to show it to you.  I'm going to show it.  The worst.  Yeah, yeah.  Creepiest tattoo ever.  The person's getting naked next.  Kristen?  Oh.  I'm taking my...  Yeah, you might as well, right?  Why not?  Give it a whirl.  Just to be silly.  Give it a whirl.  Everyone's doing it.  Everyone's doing it these days.  Holy mother of pearl. 
[03:06:00]  She has like mono or something.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Can you give us a mic?  Thank you.  Okay.  Wow.  Very lovely.  Yeah.  They're very pert.  You're very...  You're welcome.  That's something all right.  Those are C's?  Right?  Yeah.  That's something all right.  Wow.  ABC.  ABC.  Can we see your handcuffs?  That's very nice.  She's better at letters than nothing.  I'll be shy.  Yeah, of course.  That's shy.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's nice, though.  Yes. 
[03:06:30]  Look at these girls.  They're just beautiful.  I'm sorry.  I know.  Oh, you don't have to worry about anything.  We were going to bring D also, but we heard you guys only had three mics, so we had  to do ABC.  Oh, no.  Yeah, very nice.  So what will your audition consist of?  What exactly do you do?  Will they be disrobing like this, sir?  They'll basically do a little interview and a couple pictures in their lingerie, and then  they do the rest nude.  So they would basically be at this point, and the next, they would all be completely nude.  Oh, so there is a complete nude thing that will go on. 
[03:07:00]  Of course.  Wow.  Would you girls mind practicing that portion of the thing here in our studios?  We're going to see first, I guess.  See first.  See first.  Yeah, I might as well.  It's all for fun.  Like, oh my Jesus.  Oh my God.  I almost swallowed my gum.  Wow.  Wow, yeah.  Well, she wasn't lying.  Oh my God.  That's definitely...  Oh, you have like a little...  On her ass, too, because she's very tanned.  You have like the little tan thing where it's like lips. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah, I tanned in her tattoo.  Wowie kazowie.  You have to go to the mic, sweetheart.  We can't hear you.  You have to go to the mic.  Wow.  I tanned in my neighbor here's tattoo.  You have a very, very lovely body.  That's amazing.  What's your name?  Jessica.  Oh, Jessica.  Okay, should we go B next?  B next, I guess.  All right, Jessica.  I'm shy.  Don't be shy.  Oh, no.  No, don't be shy.  You're going to have to do it anyway.  That's true.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They'll be doing it.  These girls are amazing.  Just amazing.  Is either one of you on your period? 
[03:08:00]  Is that what it is?  Okay, because sometimes girls don't want to get...  No, I'm not even being nasty, but some girls have been like, I don't want to, because,  you know...  No, I got confused, because that's your usual pick-up line.  Yeah, I walk over, and if they say yes, I poke them, and I go, huh?  Who's better than me?  But no.  Are you really shy?  Oh.  Why?  Yeah.  Why?  Silence.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So telly. 
[03:08:30]  Usually in the castings, there's two people in the room, so sometimes they're not used  to as many.  No, but if they...  But for an actual shoot, yeah, there's a lot more.  For a shoot, there's a lot of people.  Open and willing and able.  The other girl's now going, what the fuck?  Why don't you talk?  She's going, what the fuck?  Can I wonder if you take off your pants?  Yeah, exactly.  All right.  Join us.  I've been praying somebody would say that to me.  Yeah, no, no, that eliminates the legality of it.  Rip your pants off.  Yes, your honor.  She asked for it.  Yes, but Jim, they didn't say follow them onto the elevator while tugging it. 
[03:09:00]  I know, but it's my own interpretation, right?  So why don't you talk the other girls into it?  Yeah, we're not doing anything terrible.  I mean, we're not going to grab you or, you know, I won't even look if you don't want  me to do it.  You girls have nothing to be shy or ashamed about.  I will tell you that much.  It's beautiful, and to see the beauty of the rest of you would be a pleasure for us.  Yeah, it would be nice.  Maybe a seat on the magazine.  Oh, boy. 
[03:09:30]  See, but if you do a photo shoot, you're going to have to do it in front of a bunch of people.  I found it.  You're back.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, I had to find the...  Look at what happened.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm too old to be in here, man.  I feel like a fucking creep.  I feel like kids over here.  I'm a rose by any other name.  I feel like a creep, do you?  Yeah, no.  I'm past that age.  Yeah, really?  We go to a titty bar and actually feel like, you know, some sort of, like, respectable human  being.  Yeah, yeah.  I just sit there and go, what happened? 
[03:10:00]  You're just the creepy guy?  Yeah, what happened?  Yeah, I don't.  Out of respect.  God bless them.  I hope they win the competition.  They're lovely.  Billy.  But Jessica and A don't want to get naked.  They're all shy over there.  Then they shouldn't.  Then they should not.  There you go.  There you go.  Bill's the voice of reason in this.  If the girl's the girl...  The voice of reason.  No means no.  Did she yawn yet?  That's all I want to know.  No.  Bill's not the voice of reason.  Bill's the voice of, like, a girl's about to blow you, and his head pops in and goes,  have you both been tested for diseases? 
[03:10:30]  Oh, my God.  Jimmy, I'm sorry.  I'm ruining your fun here.  You don't have a boyfriend?  You don't have a girlfriend.  Oh, okay.  You have a girlfriend.  Yes.  That's it.  Oh, well.  So you're saying you're seeing somebody who thinks you're more committed than you are?  Have you ever had phone sex, ma'am?  Oh.  Is that also a direct that turns me?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm asking you.  I am naked, and I'm getting all the questions.  That's exactly how it works. 
[03:11:00]  That's how it works.  You suddenly become the star.  That's all it takes in this studio.  Oh, evidently, she was like, I'll take everything off so these guys stop asking me these annoying questions.  Hold on.  Let me explain to me.  You don't divert attention away by being nude.  I don't want these guys to look at me.  Here's my vagina.  Oh, yuck.  My work isn't done.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, yeah.  So, Jessica, why are you shy?  You seem very outgoing.  Yeah.  I am.  Just a little nervous.  I am?  Yeah, and honor that feeling. 
[03:11:30]  Well, I'm excited.  Playboy is going to be fun.  Have you done radio before?  Uh, no.  Okay.  Have you done radio before?  No, I haven't.  Let us know when you do, because this isn't.  Will you be on my show?  What show?  I don't know yet, but.  Oh, yeah?  You want to have a radio show?  Everyone wants a radio show.  Yeah.  Podcast or something.  Start out there.  We actually just found Jessica last night out.  Really?  And now she's here today, so it's her first time.  You know what?  You got to give her a little credit then. 
[03:12:00]  Wow.  She's already topless.  Right, yeah.  And she actually couldn't get her top off fast enough.  Imagine what would happen if we stayed here until Sunday.  I know.  Wow.  She fucking did it in the lobby.  Right.  Jessica, wait.  We're indoors.  Oh, wow.  I would have done it last night, too.  Like, I'm here.  All right.  Are you, like, a crazy drinker?  You seem sober now.  I'm, yeah, it's in my, I'm Irish, and I could throw Jameson shots back.  Oh, wow.  Jameson.  Ugh.  Love it.  Hardcore.  See, I don't drink.  Jameson's in water.  No, I could drink for you.  Really?  Okay, good.  Yeah. 
[03:12:30]  I don't know.  So what kind of guys do you like?  Jameson on the rocks is, like, refreshing.  I'm not hitting on you on your face.  Refreshing.  No.  It's like a fresca.  Like, Kurt Cobain and Chris Brown had a baby.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  So you like a guy who will beat you and then shoot himself.  Wow.  I like tattoos and just, you know, rocker.  Maybe, like, an L.A. kind of look.  Okay.  Oh.  No one in here.  For, like, a New York state of mind.  Traps, you guys have that tattoo? 
[03:13:00]  I found the creepiest fucking tattoo ever.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Pop that up.  Pop that up.  Does this have anything to do with what we're doing right now?  Doesn't matter.  No?  All right.  Fair enough.  Doesn't matter.  Fair enough, Bill Barr.  And what about you?  Why are you shy there, Miss No. 1?  Yeah, you've already done Playboy.  Yeah.  I'm not shy.  Just a little, um, too many eyes on me right now.  Overwhelmed?  Is there so many men than me?  Isn't that the point?  Isn't that the point?  Yeah.  You don't have a lot of eyes on me?  That's true, because if you're going to be in Playboy, there's going to be a lot of  eyes on you.  Yeah, a lot of eyes.  That's true. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah, yeah.  We're going to be litmus.  It'll probably be like a photographer that makes her feel comfortable, and then she'll  feel better, as opposed to five guys leering at her.  That's true.  No, but here's the difference, though.  It's like vulnerability, you know?  But a photographer that makes you feel comfortable.  What is this?  Oh, my God.  That is the creepiest tattoo.  Can you turn that this way up?  That is a creepy-ass tattoo.  What the fuck?  Wow.  Fucking scene.  Come on.  Oh, wow.  It's very funny.  It's a girl who has tattooed over her pussy.  She has two little baby legs coming out.  Oh, my God. 
[03:14:00]  And a little baby body, so it looks like a little child tattooed and a giant lady vagina.  You know what that tattoo is?  No, no, but you're missing that it's a little girl crying.  Crying and clinging.  Grabbing the sheets behind her or whatever it is.  What the fuck?  I'm going to go out on a limb and say, yeah, that person was molested.  No, let me say that.  That tattoo, Bill calls it creepy.  I say, that is fucking hilarious.  And I would LOL for an hour if a girl got naked.  That's fantastic.  That is pretty creepy.  That's sick.  Bill's growing up.  Is what it is. 
[03:14:30]  You're growing up, Bill.  Yeah, he's putting me, he's beyond the point of finding a crying infant sexy.  Not aging, not anything like that.  You're maturing.  That's Ant's idea of selling out.  What, baby pussy's no good for you anymore?  You've gone corporate.  That's fucking twisted.  Do we know who that girl is?  That tattooed that shit on her side?  I'm sure she's a despicable person.  You do?  WTF tattoos.  Look up, all the shame.  I'm sure you have it on the ONAC.  What kind of tat would you like?  I'll get something like hidden. 
[03:15:00]  Where?  Maybe somewhere near my vagina.  Really?  Yeah.  Like a 69.  So you'll let a tattoo artist gawk at you, but wear pieces of shit, I guess.  That would be something you might regret when you get older.  Yeah.  That could be, yeah.  Yeah, that's why.  You shouldn't do that.  You shouldn't do that.  Keep that area.  Especially 69.  69 stretches out.  Kind of tats.  There you go.  Why don't you take this bucket and get yourself a cup of coffee.  He wants to save one.  Yeah.  Nothing wrong with this.  He wants to save one.  Yeah, you don't want to have yo hit dis tattoo. 
[03:15:30]  Trust me.  By the time you're 27, that's really going to be, and you meet some guy who actually,  you know, when you're trying to hide the past, that's some major fingerprints.  That's right there.  But I think that in this day and age, you'll attract a better guy that way.  Oh.  Yeah, a guy that's a little bit, you know, you don't want a stiff in the bedroom or a  bore.  Maybe you do.  You don't want a guy who looks at a tattoo by the vagina and goes, oh, yuck.  There we go.  Good cop, good cop.  Either way you go, it's a good thing.  The new show, Jimmy, let's go pitch that. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah, good cop, good cop.  What's that?  I've never heard a yuck.  No, can I see your tattoo on your ass again?  Because I've never seen that before.  You can just turn around and shut the whole thing.  You don't have to be exclusive to one side.  I'll look at the other.  That's a nice tattoo.  That's very nice.  How'd you find her last night?  What, were you just searching around, looking at a bar?  We were just out at, we were just, you know, searching New York.  And you fucking walk up and you're like, hey, I'm with Playboy Magazine.  Actually, one of my assistants brought her over and then, that's how we met her.  Is the assistant a lady? 
[03:16:30]  She's a lady, yeah.  Yeah, okay.  That's a lot easier than just some, yeah, going over to her, trying to fucking drag her  in.  And you work at a lounge?  Yeah, it's like a restaurant.  Oh, okay.  Do you do very well with tips?  Because you have a very nice smile.  You're very personable.  Thank you.  Yeah, I do good.  I think I'm just pretty much like down to earth, so I'm not like trying to get, you know.  Good thing.  Not floating.  Yeah.  Well, what do you want to do?  Um, I kind of just.  Veterinarian, work with animals.  I'm guessing, right?  Yeah.  No, she's the animal girl. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, she's the animal girl.  Entrepreneur, you know.  A couple businesses I want to like open up.  What kind of businesses?  There's a couple little things.  Yeah.  Don't want to disclose.  Well.  Yeah, don't give away the ideas.  That's good.  Don't give away the ideas.  What's going on?  What's that?  But are you creating some kind of a weird business?  No, it's not weird.  It's pretty normal.  What industry is it in?  Actually, it's kind of fun, but I don't want to.  It's really fun.  Give us a head.  All right.  What industry is it?  It involves golf, wedges, and booty shorts.  Oh. 
[03:17:30]  Wedges and booty shorts.  The password is?  Golf, wedges, and booty shorts.  You allow.  Carnac.  She wants camel toe hot pants that you can golf in.  No.  That's the wedge.  The wedgie.  Yeah, yeah.  You're going to have girls that will put a wedge in their hiney and allow somebody to  golf golf in.  No, she's talking about shoes, right?  Dirty.  Are you talking about a club or shoes?  A wedge.  Shoes.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm thinking golf, too. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A golf course, wedge shoes.  If you pay more, maybe we could negotiate something along with your head.  You'd be surprised how many times I've heard that.  Does it involve golf carts?  Would a golf cart be involved?  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What happened?  I see what they're doing.  What happened?  I see what she's doing.  What happened?  I would back this idea.  I'm not going to tell anybody.  All right, okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'd put money into it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:18:30]  All right.  That's going to be great.  Well, this was great.  She's a mover and a shaker.  Yeah.  Good ideas.  All right, well, good luck.  Always thinking.  Good luck to you guys.  Jimmy's mic has been covering up, like, the best part.  Oh, it's my face?  Yeah.  No.  Oh.  Oh, you mean the beautiful girl naked?  Yeah.  You're making an eclipse.  See, it's like eclipse.  But...  Jesus.  Bill's mature.  You used to be as...  What do you mean?  You used to be as big a degenerate as all of us.  I am a degenerate. 
[03:19:00]  No.  Now you're just...  Keep your clothes on, young ladies.  Go back to school.  But they're all very smart women.  They're not dumb girls.  I didn't even take it to that level.  No.  It was just like she was going to get 69 above her hoo-ha, and I said, you might not want  to do that.  Are you saying that...  I don't think that's really out of the ordinary.  I think it was good, solid advice.  When you get old, it will stretch out, maybe not look right.  Killing the fun in the room.  Someone's dad or something.  Yeah.  I like a good 69 tattoo.  Yeah?  I used to...  I know a good one.  Good cop. 
[03:19:30]  On CBS.  But I do like that.  I like...  I saw a girl with flame tattoos on her vagina.  Really?  Yes.  Yeah.  Boo.  Boo.  I liked it a lot.  Yeah.  Yeah, but 69 is not like a sex position.  It is, though.  No, I mean, in terms of what I wanted, it's more of like my cancer sign.  Yeah, but you don't have to explain that.  Oh, it's terrible.  You don't have to turn off.  No one will believe that.  They're like, oh, 69, and you're like, no, no, no, it's about cancer.  Yeah, no one's going to buy that.  You never want to go through that explanation.  Yeah, yeah.  How does 69 tie in with cancer sign?  Why don't you just get a crab?  That's another bad message. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah, that's true.  Crab.  Yeah, I have a crab on my vagina.  Yeah, so how does that tie in with cancer?  I don't know.  I'm a cancer.  July 19th is my birthday.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I just wanted to say something that nobody gave a shit about.  Yeah.  And I succeeded.  No, you've never seen the symbol?  No.  The astronomical?  That's...  Or the astrological symbol?  I don't know just why he would do that.  Oh, okay.  It's like a six and a nine.  Maybe we like that position the most.  Do you?  Yeah.  You know what?  I really do.  I like to be on my back with a girl over my face.  Yeah.  And I like to make this sound. 
[03:20:30]  I don't know about the sound.  No, that's the sound.  I make...  And I tap her leg like in a UFC match when I can't breathe.  That's what I like to say.  But I know 69 is very...  There's something close and intimate about it because you're hugging somebody's back.  And usually what I'll do...  Grabbing their ass.  Grabbing their ass.  And I'll actually wrap my legs around their head and then we'll just roll around on the  living room floor.  Just kidding.  I don't do that.  I don't do that.  Stop dropping at all. 
[03:21:00]  But yeah, I do like to grab the hiney.  Yeah?  Oh.  A bunch.  Are you an ass man?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  I like ass men.  He comes out of asses, too.  Very much so.  Yeah.  I don't know why I've always liked...  We discussed earlier how I have a very clean ass and I'm a big fan.  You want to know how he cleans his ass?  Yeah.  Because I wanted to see if these girls think it's weird.  Water pick?  No.  Jimmy sticks...  Jimmy puts toilet paper on his finger and sticks it all the way up there.  Not all the way up.  To keep it clean.  I wipe the outside, but I put a little paper on my finger and I go in and pull it out so 
[03:21:30]  it's clean.  Guys, it's 10 in the fucking morning here.  What's up?  All right, listen.  Let's get out of here.  All right, man.  I'm out.  I got shit to do.  Goddamn billion.  That's it.  Wait, Dwight.  It's 10 o'clock.  Does it get stuck in there?  All right, Bill.  It's 10 o'clock.  Bill, thanks for...  It's always good to see you guys.  Thanks for coming in again.  Ladies.  Good having Bill.  I might sneak out with Bill.  Okay.  I'm out.  Oh, man.  I'm out.  Bill's taking off.  Yeah.  Jimmy.  Good seeing you, Bill.  Good seeing you, and I'll talk to you about that thing. 
[03:22:00]  Yes, yes.  All right?  Absolutely.  Are you getting my text messages?  Yeah, but send them to the 917.  Sam, thank you, buddy.  Don't leave.  Thank you.  All right.  I think you're going to do great with this.  That's great.  Good seeing you, man.  Wow.  We're not leaving yet.  No, no.  We'll sit for another few minutes.  We'll sit with the gals for a couple more minutes.  Sure.  A few more minutes and tie things up as it would be.  Now, we were discussing ass cleaning.  Right, yes.  And how I like to do it, I don't jam a finger all the way in.  I just put a finger with some paper on it, and it's hygienic. 
[03:22:30]  I mean, you want to be completely clean, or maybe I'll take a wet nap, and I'll do that  until it's clean, and then I know I'm good.  I wake up after a wet nap.  Have you ever heard of a bidet?  I know.  A bidet.  I would like a bidet, but I just, I cum immediately.  No, I'm kidding.  No, I don't have a bidet.  I just never got one.  It was just too weird to sit there.  It's like an assault.  I don't like it.  Okay, it's kind of weird to shove your finger up your asshole.  That is weird.  Tomato, tomato. 
[03:23:00]  But yeah, maybe you're right.  It is weird, but I guess I'm a hygiene freak with that, and it's like, you know.  Doesn't a bidet make it like, like, pieces of toilet paper would just stick there?  No.  Don't you got to dry off somehow?  How do you do that?  No, you actually strap yourself in with a belt, and you turn it on full force.  I would just recommend, like, baby wipes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Baby wipes.  Baby wipes are fine.  Just don't insert it.  No.  No, because, you see, if you're cleaning the outside, if you're just rubbing, and again,  I'm not saying I insert it like, you know, I don't put it on something and sit on it. 
[03:23:30]  I just put a little bit in.  The ass is like a self-cleaning oven.  You just got to deal with the outside of it.  Don't worry about it.  No, no, no, no.  You're getting way in there.  No.  That's crazy.  Let me ask you, do any of you, when you're going down on a guy, would any of you consider?  Tossing salad.  Oh, wow.  No, never?  No.  What do you mean tossing salad?  Like, you know, I like to, if I lick a girl's ass, do you think licking a guy's ass is disgusting?  Yeah, totally.  Okay. 
[03:24:00]  Totally disgusting.  Yeah, that's, ugh.  See, Jessica's not sure.  She doesn't want to seem like...  I mean, that's a little too low.  I wouldn't go all the way down.  Yeah, I wouldn't go all the way either.  But I would, like, you know, go almost.  Jessica, you're talking...  How does that call that area?  You're talking buttocks or something?  No, she's a true prox.  She just doesn't want to seem disgusting.  I mean, I think I'm going to keep him happy.  We'll crack area, but you're not going right there to ground zero.  No.  Right?  You're not going to the bullseye.  Right, right, right.  Would it turn you off if I grabbed my toes and pulled my legs behind my ear and started 
[03:24:30]  going, huh?  That would be...  Yeah.  Huh?  Just your toes.  No, but you'd be surprised how many women do that, and it's like, I never want to be  disgusting.  I never want to be unclean.  I understand, but I wouldn't even let a girl...  That's just...  I would do it in a second.  Like, do you girls like having it done to you?  What?  I think it's funny.  Having your ass licked.  Having your ass licked is funny?  I think it's funny.  It's funny?  It doesn't do anything for me. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah?  But guys, some guys like it, like, so much.  That's hilarious.  It does nothing for you?  No.  You just start chuckling?  You put on a fucking Joe Biden smile and just...  Think about what I'm going to do after he licks my ass.  I'm like, grocery.  Oh, so you don't...  Oh, you zone out while he's back there eating your ass.  You're actually making a to-do list.  Yes.  Cool.  It's not a do-do list.  I get it?  Yeah.  It's funny, the things that you come up with to do.  A suppository's towel to dry hiney with. 
[03:25:30]  Pepto-bismol.  And so Jessica's basically saying that she lives for it, and you?  I don't go totally down.  No, no.  To let somebody do it to you, though?  Oh.  I mean, I don't feel anything, but...  Wow.  What are we doing this for nothing?  Yes.  We just uncovered a secret.  Sheepers.  Creepers.  Yeah, so guys.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Oh, you're here for Playboy, too?  Hi.  How you doing?  She's getting naked, also.  Oh, good.  Yep.  A little late.  Whoa.  Not...  Oh, well, we're still here. 
[03:26:00]  Ah, I like her attitude.  Yeah, exactly.  Look, she pulls up a chair, sits in, grabs the mic.  She's very comfortable, this one.  Yeah.  Have you ever posed in Playboy before?  All the time.  Oh, you have?  Okay.  Do you know these ladies?  No, I haven't.  I haven't.  Do you know these ladies?  Do you all know each other in any way, shape, or form?  No.  No?  She's one of my assistants.  Oh, you got her yesterday.  Yeah.  Well, no, I met her yesterday.  We got her yesterday.  Yeah, yeah.  We've covered a lot of ground.  She giggles when her ass is being kissed and licked.  The girl on the end, whose name I don't remember, I'm sorry. 
[03:26:30]  Christina.  Christina.  Christina is absolutely numb in the buttocks for whatever, due to, I guess, a fall.  And Jessica put lips tattooed on her ass because that's exactly where she wants a guy at all  times.  They're a fucking diverse group.  A very diverse group.  And unique in their quality.  They are.  None of them are the same.  Exactly.  I mean, Jessica, I'm sorry, your name?  Christina.  Christina and Jessica are a little bit shy about removing their bottoms.  And this...  You don't know my name because I took off my bottom.  Yes. 
[03:27:00]  Oh, man.  I didn't know your name before.  But now I'll remember it.  What is it?  Kristen.  Oh, Kristen, Christina, and Jessica.  That's why it got a little bit confusing.  Yeah.  And she's a very nice girl, but she has problems with figures.  Numbers.  She's not...  Yeah, yeah.  She underestimates.  Yeah, yeah.  It happens.  Yeah, yeah.  It happens.  Okay, so are you also going to get in the same state these girls are in?  You know what?  I wasn't invited.  No?  I thought someone just said she was going to get in.  Didn't you just say that?  No.  No.  She works with us.  They were kidding.  Oh, they're kidding.  She's another maid person.  Exactly.  She's a maid man. 
[03:27:30]  I'm the help.  Yeah, you're the help.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right, well...  So how did you find it?  Listen to the disappointment.  Yes.  That's a compliment.  Jennifer and Kim over there, when we go out, they kind of help find all the girls.  Because it's less threatening, and it's more believable.  Right.  If two women walk up to you than if a guy...  Like, if I walked up to you, but, like, do you want to be in Playboy?  You know, how...  How are you approached?  How did she approach you?  I mean, we met, like, through Facebook.  Some of my pictures, she told me I had a good look.  And so we actually met in, like, a lobby of a hotel, and... 
[03:28:00]  It's a little dangerous.  Not a lobby.  No, that's fine.  No, how would you know that it's just not a guy?  Oh, well, because, I mean, Instagram, and, you know, it's really hard to, like, you know,  fake yourself out nowadays.  Is it?  I mean, to get tagged.  She was, like, beautiful, from Connecticut.  I could tell her 860 number, so...  Yeah, and so...  All right.  So you were playing it safe.  You weren't being completely crazy.  No, she was really nice.  We, you know, she told me to bring a friend, and we all went out, and, you know, I got 
[03:28:30]  to meet everyone.  Oh, that's good.  So it was a legitimate thing.  Everybody went out and had fun.  Yes.  And it was, like, we're real people.  We're not just...  Like, I would probably say, look, just come to my apartment.  I just got a digital camera.  I have a casting call there.  What's that?  I said, I have a casting call in my apartment.  Yeah, exactly.  It would just be kind of gross and creepy and pornographic, and nobody buys that.  No, it's very professional.  Believe me, nobody buys it.  But just so you know what they're posing for...  I'm sorry, they're promoting...  October 15th, 16th, 17th, here in New York.  Go to Playboy.com, because they're looking... 
[03:29:00]  You have to make an appointment, but they're actually looking for regular, attractive girls  between 18 and 28.  Five foot to five foot 11.  So if you're very small and petite, or if you're just...  I make the requirement.  You're screaming at me.  Yeah.  You're screaming.  Don't get angry.  No, no.  She's very, very aggressive.  How tall are you, Kristen?  How tall are you?  Five foot and three quarters in a minute.  Nice.  She just made it.  She makes it.  So basically, five foot to five 11.  All what Playboy considers human sizes. 
[03:29:30]  If you're any shorter or any taller, you're either a freak or you're a lumbering oaf.  You don't want Fred Gwynn coming in.  Exactly.  Look at my tits, Lily.  If you own a Lady Liberty jersey that fits, don't show up, because your feet are too big,  and no one's going to want to look at you nude, you big creep.  And you have to be attractive, all right?  Don't show up with fucking, you know...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Don't show up if you're ugly.  Don't even bother.  Natural or enhanced.  They're not picky, as long as you look good.  Your breasts have to be within four cup sizes of each other. 
[03:30:00]  So if you're lopsided, if you have an A and an F, fucking stay home.  And minimal tattoos.  Yeah, yeah.  Minimal tattoos.  Like, if you saw what Mike Tyson did was a smart move, stay home, because you're bikerish  and you probably do fucking meth.  And you've got to be in shape.  Don't be delusional.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, please.  If you're a female version of me, don't think you're going to show up with your fucking crew  cut and your out-of-shape body and be photographed by Playboy.  Yeah, your sassy attitude isn't going to get you by, I look good. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah, and don't think that guys like you've heard...  People always tell me I'm fun to hang out with.  Yeah, of course.  I don't care.  It's because they don't want to fuck you.  You're awful.  And the girl next door, you don't have to look like a model.  You can look very organic and natural.  I live next door to a preschool, so it's probably not the appropriate thing there.  Yes, which is odd, because he didn't before.  He actually built it out of his own furnace.  And legally, I'm not allowed to live next door to a preschool.  It's so funny to build something and still walk over there with a notice.  Oh, that Lopeski law.  And 18 to 28. 
[03:31:00]  No one underage, please.  Don't apply.  All ethnicities.  There's no racial bigotry or Playboy.  As long as you're attractive, two and five foot and 5'11".  They don't care if you're black or white or Asian.  Mixed, even better.  Mixed people make great, very, very...  American Indian over there.  Puerto Rican and Irish.  Puerto Rican, Irish, Indian.  Fucking fantastic combination.  A little bit of everything.  Extremely white.  White, Aryan Nazi girl.  Aryan, basically.  That's good.  She's a little Nazi.  The master race you'll find, too.  And what nationality are you?  Russian.  Russian, see?  Russian.  You can even have immigrants who have come from far away. 
[03:31:30]  Cold War battles mean nothing here.  It's all behind us now.  We're all friends.  The differences between other countries has no bearing here.  If you're Iranian or Iraqi or Libyan, you're welcome to be in Playboy.  Exactly.  There's no bigotry with culture here.  No cultural bigotry.  Drop the burka and let's have some fun.  Exactly.  You're all equal.  Right.  Unless, of course, you're ugly or you're old or too young or you have too many tattoos.  Then go fuck yourself because they're not going to let you in the door.  Send a picture and they'll just pretend it went to spam. 
[03:32:00]  You fucking troll.  Now, here's the model rates.  $500 a day for Playboy.com shoots.  That's pretty nice.  Now, conceptual or theme shoots pays $1,000 a day.  A conceptual or theme shoot would be if you go to my house and I photograph you naked  and we have sex twice.  That's a theme shoot.  I just made it up as I went along.  It never works.  And if you're a playmate, it's $25,000.  Nice.  So it's actually, I mean, you know, the girls were very nice because one got naked.  Two were a little shy but got topless. 
[03:32:30]  They're topless.  So who's complaining?  Better than a lot of porn girls are coming here.  Yes.  Because the penthouse girls, I have to say, get nude immediately.  Oh, don't.  Like, they literally, no, no.  But I'm saying, this is the breakdown.  The Playboy girls were much better than I thought because I figured they'd be prudish.  They were not prudish.  They were all fun.  There's no reason to believe that.  Well, you know, she shaves everything.  She has a tattoo on her ass and a koi fish.  Beautiful.  She wants to get arrows pointing towards her vagina tattoo.  No, no, really.  It's my astrological sign.  So the girls are great.  And fucking porn girls suck. 
[03:33:00]  They never want to get naked.  Yeah, yeah.  They're terrible.  Never, never, never.  They're awful.  Girls are very, very beautiful.  Yeah.  Thanks so much for coming in.  Jessica, Christine, and Christina.  Best of luck to you three.  Thank you for having us.  Thank you so much.  Can there be multiple winners on this?  There's no contest.  It's not like a contest, right?  No.  You're just looking for attractive girls.  Attractive girls.  You know who wins?  Me and Anthony win.  Right.  Because we get to look at these gals naked.  Because we're here and they're naked.  Yeah.  Just curious, how many girls have you guys had naked in here, total?  Tremendous amount. 
[03:33:30]  Tremendous amount.  Yeah.  Every show there's a naked girl.  But sometimes they're terrible.  Yeah, I mean.  And you girls, all three are very pretty, so it's not an issue.  We've had some very, very beautiful girls naked, some porn stars naked, some that wouldn't.  It was very, who cried in here?  It was so bizarre.  Mary Carey was here.  She's a friend of ours.  She's a porn girl.  And another porn girl who I guess was coming down off something or whatever.  Remember at XM?  Yeah.  She started crying and getting fucking weird.  Mary's trying to get her to take her clothes off.  It was like, this is just not fun anymore.  Yeah, it really got weird.  I liked your best on celebrity rehab. 
[03:34:00]  Oh, Mary?  Yeah.  I don't know how well it took, though.  Because then all of a sudden, the next thing you know, she's fucking young.  I'm going to run for governor.  All right.  Mary.  Sure you are.  Good for you.  God bless.  Get home safe.  All right.  Well, I guess we're done.  Great.  My own plugs.  I'll be in Philadelphia October 25 through 27 at Helium.  Four of the shows are sold out.  One of them is almost, so the Thursday late show is availability.  And October 19th, I'm doing Club Madrid in Vegas.  And my special is now on Netflix.  Yes.  So.  The Jim Norton experience. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah.  It's everywhere.  Yeah.  I love it.  Again, thank you, ladies, sir.  Thank you.  Lady, lady, madam.  Wonderful.  Yes.  Thank you so much.  And I just want to tell you about Dish.  Please.  Can I?  Can I get a little music?  Oh, boy.  Who's back there?  Sal.  Sal.  Thank you, ladies.  Don't mind me.  I'm just going to read something.  You'll make it organic and natural.  I absolutely will.  Dish has been all over the news lately.  Not like that.  Of course not. 
[03:35:00]  They got their whole home DVR.  HD.  It's the hopper.  It allows people to skip commercials.  What's not to love about that?  The LA Times even did an online survey.  And three-quarters of Americans said they'd actually pay extra money to be able to skip  commercials.  No big surprise there, right?  Here's how that works.  Dish Auto Hop.  It simply lets you skip over the ads.  In many primetime HD shows, there's no fast-forwarding, no picking up your remote.  You don't have to do anything, really, which is kind of what TV's all about in the first  place.  Give them a call.  1-800-WATCH-TV to sign up. 
[03:35:30]  And you'll be enjoying Auto Hop.  Exactly.  Watching TV shows.  No commercials.  Sitting through that.  Because that's the worst part of watching TV.  What's not to like?  The major networks might not be too crazy about it, but who cares what they think?  If you hate wasting time watching commercials, you need to get this.  Give them a call.  1-800-WATCH-TV and find out more about it.  1-800-WATCH-TV.  Dish.  Let's watch TV.  The O.P. and Anthony Show is available later today with SiriusXM On Demand.
