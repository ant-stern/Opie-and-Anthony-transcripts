<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a discussion of questionable umpire calls in a recent Yankees game, provoking frustration and amusement from the hosts.  This segued into a detailed, and often crude, analysis of a letter written by the mistress of ESPN personality Steve Phillips to his wife, revealing intimate details of their affair.  Callers, including one named Raul, shared their own experiences with infidelity and mistresses, with much speculation about the consequences for both Phillips and his mistress, focusing on her perceived naiveté and "not knowing her place."  One caller even claimed the mistress burned the wife's photos and passport.  The hosts predicted Phillips' impending dismissal from ESPN, discussed the typical corporate suspension-before-termination process, and offered much sexually explicit commentary throughout this segment.  Anthony performed a comedic bit imagining Phillips’ reaction to the situation.

The show then shifted to a discussion of smartphones, specifically BlackBerrys and iPhones.  The hosts and numerous callers shared their experiences, frustrations, and preferences regarding various phone features and functionalities, including apps like AroundMe and Monocle.  One host recounted violently destroying a BlackBerry.  The conversation frequently digressed into tangents, punctuated by overlapping speech.  This segment also mentioned the upcoming appearances of Rich Voss, Bill Burr, and Jason Ellis,  briefly noted Pearl Jam releasing a BlackBerry app, and featured a humorous backstage bit involving producer E-Rock parading a replica championship belt around the office.  The upcoming stand-up performances of Rich Voss and Bonnie McFarlane were also mentioned.

The next segment began with a joke about a comedian’s abortion and devolved into vulgar speculation about a female celebrity's body and mental state.  The conversation then transitioned to Rich Voss’s upcoming show and a Philadelphia Phillies game before turning to the arrest of Bernard Carrick, New York City's former top cop, with speculation about the reasons for his arrest and past misconduct.  The bulk of this segment, however, focused on the arrest of radio host Dusty Dan on child pornography charges (500 images).  The hosts and callers reacted with shock and disgust, making numerous offensive jokes about the situation, Dusty Dan's co-host Deanne Stevens, and speculation about her potential involvement in an affair.  Callers, including one claiming to be a federal police officer and another a computer forensics expert, offered additional information and legal perspectives. The segment concluded with the "Jacktober" segment, criticizing the hosts and content of the "Murphy in the Morning" show from WIXX in Green Bay, Wisconsin, featuring offensive commentary on Katie Toucher’s weight, and further discussions of the Dusty Dan case and Tracy Morgan's absence from the show.

The following segment started with nonsensical banter about Wisconsin towns and glory holes,  leading to a humorous fantasy about a truck stop. A caller, Brad, shared local gossip about a Sheboygan mayor’s lewd comments.  The conversation shifted to a critique of the "Battle of the Sexes" radio bit, its variations, and the hosts' own version, featuring callers Shannon and Drew.  The hosts then lamented their past radio show’s struggles against competition, specifically "Murphy in the Morning," and discussed the broader trend of replacing talented personalities with cheaper, less-challenging alternatives.  A call from comedian Bill Burr followed, discussing his upcoming shows, his pit bull, airport encounters with obese people, societal attitudes towards obesity, and the New York Yankees.  The hosts ended this segment discussing unsuccessful attempts to secure Yankee World Series tickets.

The final segment included a phone call with Jason Ellis, promoting his "Ellis Mania 3" event, featuring bizarre contests involving electric shock collars and a fight between a porn star (Joanna Angel) and one of Ellis’ friends.  Ellis discussed his frustrations with radio management, his disdain for certain personalities (including Pharrell, accusing him of "dog-dicking" and "sucking on Howard Stern's teat"), recounted being kicked by MMA fighter Fedor Emelianenko, and revealed he was living with Benji Madden.  The conversation contained heavy profanity, references to violence, and sexually explicit content. Blind Dave, a previously injured participant in one of Ellis’ events, called in to defend himself against Ellis’ insults.  The segment concluded with plugs for Ellis’ event and radio show, and a brief mention of Rich Voss’ upcoming stand-up shows.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey, good morning everyone.  Hi.  Opie and Anthony on this fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Yes.  We got those WOW stickers and people are getting them.  We got another batch in?  We did, right?  Cool.  So I assume there's a promo running.  I've heard the promo, matter of fact.  Gives you all the details on how you can get your WOW stickers.  The damn thing works.  Yeah.  What is it, 13 years later, 12 years later?  My God, has it been that long?  People are still getting WOW'd all over the place.  You put a WOW sticker on your car and, ladies, listen up. 
[00:00:30]  If you feel like showing your fun bags, you see those WOW stickers, you whip them out and  give that guy a treat.  Yes, let him see.  And some of the ladies a treat.  We hear from the lesbos from time to time that want to see fun bags.  I ain't no be tired of no WOW.  Whatever she said.  You're still going with that?  I couldn't get it out of my head last night, even though I can't remember exactly what she  said, but I be ain't no be tired. 
[00:01:00]  I thought you would be tired.  That's a good segue.  Ah!  I went to bed at 10.30.  The Yankee game was in the fifth inning.  I'm like, oh, fuck.  It's going to be a long night for Anthony.  Yeah.  Well, I napped.  I nappied when I got home pretty long.  You napped and got ready for the big game?  Yes, I think I slept until, no, I know I slept until 5.30 in the afternoon.  That's not a nap.  From the second I got home, which was before noon, until 5.30 I slept just so, you know, 
[00:01:30]  I'd be all ready and raring to go.  So I didn't sleep after that until about 2 o'clock in the morning.  Wow.  Then I, that was my nap.  Yeah.  From 2 a.m. until now.  Right now.  And then I'll go home and crap out.  You got the worst sleep schedule.  I don't know how you do it.  The thing is, I can break it real quick by not napping.  Right.  Then I'll go to sleep early.  So it's one of those, if I got something to do at night, I'll do it that way.  If I don't, I'll do it the other way.  That's smart.  I go this way, I go that way. 
[00:02:00]  And then I can watch the Yankee game, which I did last night.  Amazing.  Weren't you just bitching about CeCe?  CeCe Sabathia.  No, no, no.  I wasn't bitching about CeCe.  Oh, no.  Joba.  Right, right, right.  Jabba Chamberlain.  I say Joba.  Joba, right.  Okay.  No, CeCe got the job done last night.  Amazing.  And it was so fucking refreshing to watch a pitcher pitch eight fucking innings.  Just pitch the game, then they bring the closer in, and game over. 
[00:02:30]  Two pitchers?  That's it.  Done.  That's like baseball in the 70s.  It was like old school baseball.  Nice.  CeCe fucking kicked ass, shut him down, held him to one run, and that was a home run.  What was the score last night?  10-1.  Oh, fuck.  You should have just went to bed early.  No, you got it.  It was over.  You got to watch.  I was watching for any more great bad calls.  That's your new thing in the playoffs.  Dude, last night topped it all.  It was some of the worst officiating I've ever... 
[00:03:00]  The worst officiating, because I was getting pummeled on Twitter last night, because I said  worse.  Oh, W-O-R-S-E.  Yeah, yeah.  It's...  Whatever.  That's the worst officiating, and he's worse than the other guy.  I guess that's how you do it.  Whatever.  That's the Queen's English.  They give me all kinds of shit.  We talk like Americans.  We just talk.  Yeah.  What's the big deal?  I don't know.  Fuck it. 
[00:03:30]  If you fuck up a little grammar here and a little grammar there.  Especially typed.  It's like, oh, I can't even do anything about it.  Most of us won't make anything of our lives where we need the perfect grammar.  Who cares?  Yeah.  Fuck it.  I'm only in communication.  Well...  I say, if you can get your point across, whatever.  Yes, then.  It's exactly it.  And you see how the ghetto kids are talking?  Look.  I no care.  We're still way ahead in the grammar race.  Yeah.  You watch some of these rap videos and how they're talking in some of the neighborhoods.  I'm not too worried that I mess up T-O and T-O-O sometimes. 
[00:04:00]  Yes.  That one I finally got straight, like, two years ago.  T-H-E-R-E and the T-H-E-I-R.  I got that one.  Nice.  Yeah, yeah.  I can do that one now.  Yeah.  They are there.  Yeah.  And there.  So what was the bad call yesterday?  There were a couple of them.  There was...  The third base should just...  I don't know.  He should have been strung up.  Why? 
[00:04:30]  Jesus Christ.  There were a couple of bad calls there.  There was one...  Jesus Christ.  You know, when you got two guys off the bag, standing there, standing at third, and they're  both tagged.  You know, perhaps they're both out.  No.  And I'm talking calls that are even like Yankees.  What do you mean?  What do you mean they're not both out?  Well, yeah.  What was the exact situation?  Travis, do you have the...  Yeah.  Canoe was on second.  Yeah.  Right.  Okay.  And Casado was on third. 
[00:05:00]  Wait.  What do you know?  Canoe was on second?  Well, what do you know?  Robbie Canoe.  Yeah.  So Swisher...  Swisher hits it to...  No.  Swishalicious.  Swishalicious.  Swishalicious.  Yeah.  Hits it, and they go to throw home to get Posada.  Posada gets caught in a rundown.  Canoe goes to third.  Yeah.  Because Posada's going to be tagged out.  He's in a rundown.  So Canoe might as well advance to third.  So about a foot away from third base, Robbie Canoe decides it's time to stop.  Canoe stops because now Posada's coming back, and it looks like Posada might have a 
[00:05:30]  chance to get back to third.  Yeah.  So either way, somebody should be at third.  Someone's going to be out, but I think they were going to...  Yeah, like Canoe was waiting to see if Posada could get back, and then he would have been  out.  Or he would have tried to run back to second and let him try to, you know, maybe fuck  that throw up or something.  So it ends up they're both just kind of standing at third off the bag.  So the third baseman there for...  Tags both.  Yeah.  Right. 
[00:06:00]  For the Angels, just tags them both.  Right.  And the ump just called out Posada.  Why?  I don't know.  It leads me back to the why.  Because he says, I really thought Canoe was on the bag.  Canoe was on the bag.  Oh, boy.  And that was after a call that was...  There was a blatant fucking tag out.  Where was that, second?  Yeah, that was at second base.  That was hysterically fucking...  Like, he totally nailed... 
[00:06:30]  Was it Jeter?  Who the fuck was sliding in?  Yeah, I'm like, I'm dumbfounded as to exactly who that was.  This is like talking sports in a kindergarten class.  Yeah, it is.  I don't know what the fuck's going on right now.  It's like kindergarten.  Well, you should see fucking...  I think we need naps in little juicy boxes.  You should see watching it.  The fucking officiating.  Just suffice to say...  It was Swisher, by the way.  Oh, Swisher, yeah.  They're nervous because a lot of people are watching them make these calls.  Yeah.  The world is watching. 
[00:07:00]  The world be watching.  They probably have, like, sour stomachs.  They're nervous.  Yeah.  Who cares?  It was 10-1.  And then there was a tagging up call that was just fucking massacred, too.  Again, third base wasn't even looking.  He was looking out at the outfield.  How could you see if the guy's tagged up?  He was probably trying to figure out what he wants for dinner after the game.  Yeah, maybe.  10-1.  Because they took a runaway when the umpire said that he had left the base before the 
[00:07:30]  ball was actually caught.  And clearly, when they showed the replay, it was fine.  It was absolutely fine.  They had, like, three different angles, and each angle showed that the third base coach  wasn't even looking at the bag.  He wasn't looking at the bag at all.  I love it.  He was looking at the outfield.  Well, worst officiating ever.  But they wound up pulling it off.  A-Rod.  Another home run?  Just the amazing Mr. October.  Mr. October.  The new Mr. October.  Who saw this coming?  What do you have?  A home run and a few RBIs?  Yeah. 
[00:08:00]  And with his homers.  How many RBI did he have?  His homers.  I don't know.  Three?  Three RBI?  I don't know.  RBI.  Zzzz.  Zzzz.  It was amazing.  Let's go to Marnie in Michigan.  Marnie!  Proper English.  It's just umpiring.  Not officiating or refereeing.  Get it straight, boys.  Ha, ha, ha.  There's a new character off for grabs out there.  I just want to let people know.  Yeah?  Grammar Man.  Yeah, thanks.  Who wants to be Grammar Man and call the show? 
[00:08:30]  You'd have a field day with this radio show.  All right, so...  Yeah, that was good.  Uh, A-Rod, um...  Yeah, amazing.  Mm-hmm.  Um, just coming through now.  Look at him go.  That's what it is.  That's why they trounced him.  They had the, uh...  They had the bats.  And they had the pitching.  That's it.  So now, you know, the same fucking assholes that have just been beating me senseless, uh...  Uh, every time they go into another series, which was like, well, they ain't getting past the Angels. 
[00:09:00]  You know, they're not passed yet, and believe me.  And we do remember the big choke against Boston, so I'm not saying shit yet.  But I'm already getting people from Philly.  Well, they ain't gonna get past fucking Philly.  Shut up!  Yankees-Phillies, that's gonna be a great World Series, my friend.  That sounds like, uh, that would be a good...  This is how it's gonna work.  Angels are gonna win, uh, a game.  Yankees get to do it at home.  Yeah, it's just how it has to happen.  You think business-wise it has to happen like that?  Yeah, of course.  They're gonna rig it so they win at home? 
[00:09:30]  Of course.  More revenue?  Of course.  They'll make it close.  The Angels will win a close game.  Speaking of baseball, that's very interesting, Ant, but we got a hell of a story that's, uh,  breaking this morning.  Oh, I love this story.  This, uh, Steve Phillips, the ESPN guy.  Oops.  I like Steve Phillips.  He does a good job.  Uh, it's on the front page of one of these papers in New York that I don't acknowledge  because they're...  Whatever.  Well, I should shut my mouth because whatever.  Uh, front page of the paper, exclusive, Mistress Bears, Steamy Affair with ESPN Star.  Wow. 
[00:10:00]  This, uh, this mistress of Steve Phillips who works for ESPN, fucking, she's 21, 22 years  old.  She wrote a letter to Steve Phillips' wife.  Ouch!  Oh, you dummy.  Detailing everything.  You dummy!  Hey, here's a guy, he's getting a little, a little, a little side action.  Yep.  She's, uh, I guess she's, like, in a, like, works closely with him, so it's not just some,  like, some broad.  Another one of these working relationship, uh, things like, uh, David Letterman. 
[00:10:30]  Right.  So she works close with Steve, uh, Phillips.  They start up an affair.  She's on the road with him, banging and, you know, rocking and rolling with Steve Phillips.  And, uh, this broad doesn't understand her place in the world.  You're just a broad.  The guy wanted some fucking side pussy.  You were the side pussy.  And, and she thought that...  Oh, she, she thought they were gonna live happily ever after.  Yeah, yeah.  She's one of these dummies.  Yikes.  You gotta know your place.  Yikes.  And you do know your place.  But you're hoping that it's gonna be something different. 
[00:11:00]  But in the end, it's not.  But apparently he, well, according to, uh, the letter that she wrote.  Which we're gonna read.  Every single word.  Oh, yeah.  Um, I think he might have said things to her.  Like, uh...  No, you gotta string him along a little bit.  You know, like, oh, yeah, well, Jesus, I don't like her.  I don't like her at all.  But...  Home life, she's a real bitch, and...  Right.  Yeah.  But, you know, we have kids, and they're still in school, and...  Yeah.  And, uh, I don't know. 
[00:11:30]  I'm a little confused.  I need a little more time.  Yeah, so just hang out, suck my dick, and everything will be cool.  Suck the poison out of my balls.  I need the poison gone.  Maybe if the poison's out of my system, then I can think clearly.  But she's the stupid one, because, you know, you gotta know your place.  Like, Steve Phillips has no intention of blowing up his entire life...  No!  ...for you.  You think he's...  You don't think this guy knows what divorce is all about?  ...and how much he would lose? 
[00:12:00]  Mm-hmm.  How much he would fucking lose?  Right.  All that good cash he's worked up...  Right.  ...over the years?  Right.  ...Gonzo?  For that?  For what?  So, she finally had it waiting around for him to do, in her opinion, the right thing.  So she decided...  Dump the wife and the kids.  She was gonna take it upon herself.  Right.  So, you know, fill the wife in on some of the, uh, more, uh, sordid details.  So it's, it's, it's right in the paper today. 
[00:12:30]  The letter Steve Phillips, uh, mistress wrote his wife.  Hi, Marnie.  Mm-hmm.  My name is Brooke.  I work with Steve.  And he and I got into a pretty heated argument on Sunday about the fact he hasn't been honest  with you about our relationship.  Now, you think right now she's like, should I just throw this letter away, um, and not  read the rest of it?  No, I, I'm more pissed at her.  I'm pissed at, I'm pissed at the mistress.  Oh, I know.  Yeah. 
[00:13:00]  Because you got, I, I'll say it over and over again.  You gotta know your place.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, was the sex good?  Was the conversation in between the bags good?  Good for you.  But that's all he wanted.  Good for you.  And if, and, and you should have realized that early on.  This was, um, definitely not, uh, her place to, to jot down this little letter.  Right.  Because it doesn't, first of all, it also doesn't sound like she's been scorned, like, completely.  Mm-hmm.  Does it sound like in that letter, at some point in that letter, that he's dumping her? 
[00:13:30]  No, because he's scared shitless of her.  Yeah, because he realized he started, you know, banging a crazy broad.  Fucking rabbit in your pot at home.  Your pet rabbit in the pot on the stove.  And I know she's 21, she's got youth on her side, but Steve Phillips isn't gonna, like,  like, like, throw everything away for a 21-year-old that's about a five, five and a half.  Yeah, she, uh.  I would maybe give you a six.  Yeah.  Maybe.  On a probably good, well-dressed day.  Which is bad if you're 21, because, like, you know, usually youth gives you an extra one 
[00:14:00]  or two points.  She's a little chubby and she's hunched over.  She's got hunchback.  Yeah.  She's probably got a big back.  Because all the jizz is building up in her backside.  He likes it that way.  It's a heavy load.  Is that it?  She didn't write that in the letter.  Yeah, why don't you write that in the letter?  Uh, just to fill you in so you know that it's your husband.  He likes, uh, taking, he likes giving in the ass, doesn't he?  Yeah.  And why don't you talk about how, how, how he makes you feel like a filthy whore? 
[00:14:30]  Fucking loser.  Uh, all right, the fact that he hasn't been honest with you about our relationship, the  letter to Steve Phillips' wife from this broad.  You see, I'm the woman he's been seeing for a while now, and I'm not just some random girl  he had sex with in parking lots.  I'm actually a close friend who works with him on a frequent basis.  Wait a minute.  Right.  Random girl in a parking lot.  Frequent.  F.H.  Riley.  A frequent, frequent basis. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  No, you're just like a girl he would bang in the parking lot.  Don't you understand that?  Yeah.  She kind of, uh, I think she's mistaken about the relationship a bit.  I care about him a lot, and I've been asking him to come clean to you about everything,  from when we first slept together in St. Louis in his hotel suite, where he assured me I  wouldn't have to worry about getting pregnant since his vasectomy, to the fact that we have  continued to talk, see each other, and scheduled meetups, even since you found out. 
[00:15:30]  So what, she found out?  So she found out, the wife, and Steve still figured out how to get this done.  He probably smoothed it over.  Look, this fucking little bitch has been coming on to me, and I'd love to hear that conversation,  the one he had with his wife.  Right.  Smoothed it over, gave the wife tennis lessons to distract her, and went back to banging  this pig of a woman.  She's a lunatic, sweetie.  I don't know what the fuck.  Right.  She kind of, I have to work with her.  Right. 
[00:16:00]  You know, she's infatuated.  If you do like where we live, they pay me very well.  Yeah.  I can't cause a problem at ESPN.  All right.  All right, honey.  You know, I would like a new car.  Yeah, sure.  You got it.  You got it.  How about I throw in some tennis lessons, too?  Yeah.  Let's go watch the kids play ball.  Right.  Vasectomy, you found out.  They continued.  Okay.  He's upset because I told him I was going to tell you everything.  Of course he's upset by that.  But it's important that you know this. 
[00:16:30]  Why is it important that you know this?  We text all day when he's at work and talk via hotel phones on the road.  The texts have always been mostly about the sexual side of our relationship, and I have  some saved if you ever want to see them.  Oh, God.  Married guys that are texting like that.  Wow.  You are taking a big chance.  Just dumb.  Big chance.  Just dumb.  I have them saved if you want to see them. 
[00:17:00]  Basically, stuff like when we'll meet up next, what we want to do to each other physically,  and how we feel about each other.  All right.  Great.  What do you think so far?  That's the first paragraph out of three.  Um, it's very bad.  This girl is very bad.  She's evil.  The only reason she's doing this is to, um, she hopes that this destroys the marriage,  and she could then have a life with this guy.  And meanwhile... 
[00:17:30]  He's going to reverse his vasectomy so he makes a new family with her?  Yeah, yeah.  Meanwhile...  Are you kidding me?  If the marriage breaks up, he sure as shit ain't going to go with her.  I don't fucking know.  He'll be like, what are you fucking writing letters to my wife now?  I'm in a bunch of shit.  Get the fuck out of here.  She's a fatal attraction.  Yep.  This is scary shit right here.  It certainly is.  Because she didn't understand her place.  Right.  There's girls out there, they should just understand their place.  She's looking for a little, uh, pooh-ha. 
[00:18:00]  If you're talking to a gentleman about leaving the wife, and he's upset about that conversation,  doesn't leave the wife, uh, there's a fucking...  There's an issue.  Right.  That means you have to realize, okay, he's never going to leave his family, so now I either  just end this thing, or I deal with it.  See, me?  I left.  That's what I did.  Right.  I was a fucking, you know, I was a gentleman about it.  I was like, you know something? 
[00:18:30]  I think me and you can hang out.  I'm leaving.  I left.  That's what you did.  That was it.  Given the choice, I was like, hmm, I think I'll leave.  Right.  And I did.  It worked out.  It was a nice, you know, nine-year relationship I, uh, had after the marriage.  I'm not saying that it's not...  I think it was fine.  I'm not saying that it's not possible where, in this situation, a Steve Phillips type of  person would actually leave his wife and kids and everything for another broad, but 
[00:19:00]  in most cases, no.  In most cases...  It doesn't happen that way.  Right.  Right.  And with the fact that he's not doing it, he's not making the effort to leave the wife,  that's the situation where the girl's got to go, all right, I either got to know my  place or get the fuck out of this.  Well, he probably made a lot of excuses, like, ah, it's her birthday coming up.  See?  No, you can't do that.  You know what?  I can't do it around Christmas.  Can't do that.  Ah, my son, he's a senior now in high school.  Oh, that's the lead on until the mistress realizes, oh, my God, this guy is never leaving the 
[00:19:30]  wife, so I'm moving on.  The wife found a bump.  We don't know what that is yet, so I got to hang in there for a while.  Just one excuse after another, stringing this dummy along, and she bought into it.  You're the dummy.  She is a dummy.  Let it be noted, I'm pointing at her and going, you are a dummy.  Dunce.  Uh, but you know what?  She left swinging.  Second paragraph.  But it's more than that.  Some of the texts and most of the calls are more about our friendship. 
[00:20:00]  We talk about his life, like when he met, like when he went to see Ryan Pitch and how  he did.  I guess Ryan is one of his kids.  The kids.  Okay?  This is going to drive the wife nuts.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You know, my husband is talking about our kids to some floozy.  See, she knows exactly how to twist the fucking knife.  Right.  Is what she's doing.  She's sticking it in and giving it a twist. 
[00:20:30]  Hence, a fatal attraction.  Yeah.  Crazy broad.  Uh, we talk about his life when he went to see Ryan Pitch and how he did.  The fact that Ryan is starting football this week with four hour long practices.  That Brett, I guess another son, is going to be in the eighth grade and get stuck with  babysitting duty a lot.  When you have family movie nights at home.  Uh-huh.  And when he's taking Kyle and Drew.  God, he's got to get four kids to baseball games.  And how close the boys are only being a year apart. 
[00:21:00]  But he talks to me about serious stuff, too.  That in some ways, Kyle and Drew are the product of your reunion after his last affair.  Oh.  So that's how he smoothed over another affair.  He had a few kids with his wife.  Oh, he had a couple more kids.  Is that what she's saying, too?  Oh, my God.  It's like, you know, those two kids that you had because he cheated and, oh.  If you were Steve Phillips, would you ever go home again when you missed the city?  Just don't even go home, right?  Don't even acknowledge this is going on.  Don't go home. 
[00:21:30]  After his last affair.  A sort of Band-Aid on a more serious problem.  And now they're the one thing holding.  It's hard to read this.  Him in your marriage since they're not old enough to understand.  Especially considering you were able to talk to Ryan and Brett about the affair.  That you married him in Michigan right after college.  And while he's glad you decided to stay at home, he enjoys being with me because I have more of a passion and drive to really do something with my life. 
[00:22:00]  Cuckoo!  Cuckoo!  That is crazy woman talk.  Cuckoo!  That's nutty woman talk right there.  Steve Phillips is with you because he thinks you're going to be something in your life?  Steve, how stupid are you?  He appreciates that I have the energy and drive and I look forward to the future and you're just some house frow sitting there with all the kids in a loveless marriage.  And he's going to be with me.  Yeah. 
[00:22:30]  And you know what Steve appreciates about this girl?  And I'm speculating.  Completely speculating.  The fact that you go on all fours and spread open your ass cheeks.  Oh, would that be something?  You're just not shy to show it all to Steve.  It's some fucking, you know, different flavor for him.  Right.  That's all.  To really do something with my life.  And then you're making him go back to mass and therapy despite the fact that he doesn't believe it will save your marriage.  But he doesn't want to lose his kids. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  Steve Phillips is in hell.  I would imagine he's maybe not in love with his wife anymore.  But, you know.  But, you know, something.  How the divorce thing is in this country, it forces guys to do this type of thing.  To do this.  Exactly.  It forces guys to do this type of thing.  You're in a loveless marriage and the guys there are going, you know, I'm going to cheat.  I'll fuck around.  I'll do whatever the fuck I want to do.  But I got to stay in the marriage because I'm going to lose all my shit.  Right.  And look at what she goes and does. 
[00:23:30]  Right.  Alerts the wife.  I'm hearing that in the online version they actually black out the names of the sons.  Oh, yeah.  See, son one, son two.  That could be a problem for this paper.  Yeah.  Maybe.  Because they're not public figures.  I don't know.  It's just a letter.  We'll see.  Reprinting the letter.  Third paragraph.  I'm not telling you all this to hurt you in any way. 
[00:24:00]  As she just takes the old salt and shakes it into the wound she just made.  How is this not hurting the wife in any way that you send this letter to her?  I'm not telling you all this to hurt you in any way, but simply to show you that I'm a real person in his life and that I care deeply about his happiness.  Thanks for the letter then.  You just fucked up their world.  See, because there's another possibility here where she knows exactly what her husband's doing, but is just dealing with it because maybe she's not into the whole love thing with him anymore. 
[00:24:30]  But they have this whole thing established and they've just decided to live their lives how it is.  Maybe she's got some cock on the side.  You don't know.  Who knows?  You don't know.  Some of these couples, they just stay together because it's just easier and they just, you know.  But now, because of this letter, she's going to have to do something that she probably didn't want to do.  Could you imagine the one in a billion shot that he comes home, she's holding that letter and goes, look at this. 
[00:25:00]  And they look and just both start laughing their asses off.  Stupid bitch.  You go get some cock.  I'm going to hit the bar.  I was raised Catholic, she continues.  And while I know our faith dissuades divorce, it also respects it with regards to infidelity because people should have the opportunity to be with the whomever makes them happy and give them what they need. 
[00:25:30]  I'm coming out now because I'm sick of hiding and sneaking around behind your back.  After I brought up our next planned intimate time together in L.A., and Steve told me maybe we should just talk there and lay low for a while so you or whomever that woman that called won't find out about me. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, oh, wait a minute.  So there's another woman.  Yeah, another woman.  Possibly.  And he said maybe we ought to lay low for a while?  Yeah.  All right.  So he's trying to give her the old shove.  Right.  He realizes this is getting a little toxic.  Right.  He's going to try to give her the old shove, so she writes the fucking letter.  We lay low, but in his words, holy shit, I've got to get rid of this crazy broad.  I've got to dump her.  I've got to find another broad.  That's easy.  But I've got to get rid of the crazy one, so I've got to kind of push her off to the side nicely. 
[00:26:30]  And she probably thinks, all right, I'm told to lay low because of the wife.  So if I write a letter and open things up to the wife and get her out of the picture, he'll come running back to me.  Wow, you are so wrong.  I mean, you're right, but this broad is so wrong.  Because she mentions that a woman called the house.  Uh-oh.  So I back up a little bit.  So after I brought up our next planned intimate time together in L.A., and Steve told me maybe we should just talk there and lay low for a while,  so you or whomever that woman that called won't find out about me. 
[00:27:00]  So she's pissed about this other woman.  She wants to know more about this woman that it looks like called the house.  Yeah.  I realize he hasn't even begun to tell you the truth.  And listen to this next line.  I may only be 22.  Aw.  Aw.  But I'm not stupid.  And I hope you can understand.  Yes, you are.  We never wanted you to find out about us this way.  I'll find out about us this way.  And why are you doing it this way? 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  I want you to meet me, and I want to tell you anything you want to know.  My cell number is, and that's blacked out.  Check the phone records.  You can see I'm not lying.  And to top it off, listen to this next one.  Steve has a big birthmark on his crotch right above his penis and one on his left inner thigh,  so you know I'm not being fake.  Oh.  Oh, she's got to fucking, she's got to fucking throw that in. 
[00:28:00]  To the guys out there that are going to cheat, clean up your shit before you start cheating.  Yeah, what are you doing?  Get rid of moles and.  Put some makeup on or something.  Get rid of all that unsightly shit.  Get some cover up.  Make sure it blends in with all the other cocks out there.  Yes.  Make your cock anonymous.  Right, because Michael Jackson did the same fucking thing.  Yeah.  You dummy.  And a big one on his left inner thigh, so you know I'm not being a fake.  Whether he chooses to stay in a loveless marriage for his kids or to move on and be with someone 
[00:28:30]  whom he says makes him feel better than he's ever felt, it's up to him.  But at least everything is now out in the open.  So he said to her.  The end.  He said to her that she makes him feel better than he's ever felt.  That's what I'm getting from that.  And she kind of rubs it in by saying, well, he could stay in that loveless marriage or be with me.  She thought this letter was going to be the best thing.  Do you think when she wrote it, she thought it was going to be in the newspaper? 
[00:29:00]  No.  How did it get there?  Did the wife just go, hey, that's got to be how.  Hello, news people.  That's got to have.  Unless this one, the CC, the paper.  I don't know.  That's a good question.  I don't know that part of this story.  Yeah, where did that come from?  I don't know.  But, yeah, I mean, it doesn't take a rocket scientist.  Steve Phillips' marriage is really fucked.  Yeah.  And this girl will not be with Steve Phillips in the end.  That's it. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  Simple as that.  Yes.  Done.  Marriage done.  And she'll probably lose her job at ESPN because Steve Phillips is way more important  than whatever secretary duties you were doing for ESPN.  It's secretarial duties that she's been up to.  Let me say hi to Raul.  Raul.  Hey, boy.  Hey, buddy.  Good evening.  Good evening.  First, boys, let me say thank you for the last 10 years of incredible entertainment.  Anyway, when I came back from Iraq, my mistress, she decides she's going to contact my wife 
[00:30:00]  and say everything from the letter that you just read.  Same exact thing down to the, you know, to the tattoo near my cock.  Oh.  And, you know, I turned her around.  You know, I give her the brush off, but I turned her around as well.  Two weeks ago, there was another chick.  And my wife decides to contact my old mistress to find out about the new chick. 
[00:30:30]  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Which I tell my wife that I wasn't with the old mistress anymore, who I've been with for  eight years.  And now it's just, I'm in hell.  But, again, I'm trying to turn it around.  And, you know, I'll do it.  Well, I mean, the question is, I mean, if you're cheating, whatever, that's up to you.  But, I mean, as far as the mistress thing goes, you don't have any intentions of, like, 
[00:31:00]  starting a whole new life with the mistress, right?  Absolutely not.  And the thing is, the mistress, she's always known her place.  And the mistress just has a problem, again, with the new chick, not my wife.  The mistress has a problem that you might have a new mistress that would also know her  place.  I totally, all right, I totally get that.  So, the mistress is already where she wants to be.  She knows that, look, this is what it is, and you're not going to leave your wife to start  a new life with her. 
[00:31:30]  The mistress.  But now the mistress is pissed, because there's another one in that category that's coming  around.  Oh, she's livid.  And there's guns involved.  And, you know, I'm fucked.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's very good.  You have fun.  You have fun with that situation.  All right, Raul.  I'm going to punch out.  I'm going to go listen to myself now.  All right.  Oh, wow.  He has been around a while.  And Danny, humpback, son, instant feedback.  Supposedly, this gets better.  The police statement is pretty amazing from the wife.  I'm hearing that right now.  And Corinne from Jersey's online. 
[00:32:00]  Corinne.  Gang, gang, gang.  Gang, gang, gang.  Hey, guys.  I actually heard there's more to this story.  Apparently, the girlfriend broke into the family's house and took the wife's pictures  and passport and burned them in the fire pit.  That sounds a little too familiar.  Oh, my God.  That's crazy.  Only a lunatic would do something like that.  Gang, gang, gang.  Gang, gang.  Gang, gang, gang.  And she hung up. 
[00:32:30]  Very good.  And she's out.  Let's go to Greg in D.C.  Greg.  Good morning, bo-bo-bo-bo-boy.  Hello, Greg.  Calling to let you know that Steve Phillips has been suspended for one week at ESPN because  he was banging a PA.  He already signed over his multi-million dollar home to his wife.  Oh.  And she has filed for divorce.  Go figure.  Yikes.  Yeah.  Apparently, he was fucking around on her a lot as the Mets manager. 
[00:33:00]  And it never got better.  Yeah.  There are, like, all these stories that are out.  Stories about him having some sex.  Some of that sex stuff.  Yeah.  During his marriage.  Oh, yeah.  That started, okay.  It started in 98 while Steve Phillips was general manager of the Mets.  A former team employee accused him of sexual harassment.  That's right.  And then I remember, oh, my God.  This seems like yesterday, but it's over 10 years ago.  He took a leave of absence to deal with that situation. 
[00:33:30]  Yep.  Yep.  Very good, Greg.  Whoops.  All right.  Well, thank you, boys.  Keep up the good work.  Oh, man.  And he's suspended for a week.  This is probably the worst week he could be suspended from ESPN.  Everything is happening right now.  Everything's happening.  For a week, do you think that's a...  He'll come back just in time for the coverage of the women's cricket tournament.  Wonderful.  You think that's just kind of a prelude to we got to get rid of this guy or a one-week  suspension?  What is that about? 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, I think he gets fired.  You think he is?  Because there's a...  You know, no offense to Steve Phillips, but there's a million guys like this that could  do what he does.  Yeah.  There's a lot of guys that could fill that position.  Don't want to tarnish the image of ESPN.  So they'll probably figure out a way to let him go.  Yeah.  They'll work it out with their lawyers.  The weak suspension is so lawyers can get together and figure out what kind of package  they've got to give them, how they could defend themselves against any lawsuits from them.  That's what a suspension is for.  There's a whole stable of old ballplayers just waiting for that opportunity. 
[00:34:30]  So you get rid of this guy because he's too controversial.  Yep.  And you know what?  I hate this...  We hate that we're saying this, but it's just the reality that we live in in this world,  especially in the media.  You know, it's much easier to get rid of the controversial figures.  Yep.  And move on with someone else that has a cleaner image.  Mm-hmm.  Happens in radio.  It just happens everywhere.  Unfortunately, it doesn't happen in places like the presidency where Bill Clinton was 
[00:35:00]  able to do that and survive.  But when you're a sportscaster, my God, that's important.  Right.  Did we get the police report?  Is there anything else there, Danny?  Well, it's in the article.  Oh, it is.  It's the same stuff for the most part?  I already read the note.  So what is that guy saying?  He links me to the exact story that I have up here.  Duh!  Is that the one we just read?  Oh, okay.  There's also reports that she posed as a classmate of Steve Phillips' son and found him on Facebook  and started asking questions about, like, Steve and his family and all sorts of, like, 
[00:35:30]  personal stuff.  Oh, she's a fucking nut job.  That's great.  She's a nut job.  Oh, is this guy in some shit?  But he's stupid.  He probably let her on.  He probably did do that.  But you know something, as a guy, sometimes you do that.  You know?  This just ends.  You're married.  You're a married guy?  Yeah.  You know, what are you supposed to say?  All right, look.  You're the whore.  I'll be coming by and fucking you.  I'm married, so I gotta, you know, keep that thing together. 
[00:36:00]  There's nothing that's gonna stop that, by the way.  You gotta be a good juggler?  No matter how good you can clinch your fucking vagina muscles, you, it just, I'm not leaving  the wife.  You gotta, you gotta keep all those plates spinning, man.  Yeah.  What a nightmare.  Just spinning around.  And then you, you gotta, you know, you can't tell her that.  You gotta say things like, well, yeah, God, oh, let me tell you what happened today.  And the girl's like, what, what, what happened today? 
[00:36:30]  Oh, that fucking woman that I'm married to.  Oh, oh, my God.  You could talk to me.  Tell me.  She says that as she's disrobing.  Yeah, yeah.  You could talk to me.  You could talk to me as her big, ample tits come like, out of her shirt.  And you go, blurk, blurk, blurk, blurk.  And she goes, and she's just thinking, this is great because he's talking to me about his  problems.  So it's more than him just, you know, railing me with his birthmarked cock. 
[00:37:00]  And his big birthmark on his upper thigh.  Yeah, on his upper thigh.  He really is appreciating what I do.  What the fuck, man?  Cut that shit off if you're gonna cheat.  Oh.  God damn.  Ka-chunk, ka-chunk, ka-chunk.  Uh, let's see.  God.  Silvio in Ohio.  How are you, buddy?  Good morning, guys. 
[00:37:30]  Hey.  Hey.  Uh, ESPN's more of a national sports channel than we think.  Everybody being from the tri-state, mostly.  There's a lot of Bible belt and people with high standards for marriage that just want to  maybe see a reaction from the channel that hires him for the adultery.  I hope he doesn't get more than the week,  but I think that ESPN's knee-jerk way is saying,  hey, we slapped him on the wrist.  We don't condone this sort of stuff.  Yeah.  For all those states that are kind of,  that are real high up on the values of marriage. 
[00:38:00]  So you're saying what?  That he's not going to keep his job?  I don't see why not.  Just a few months ago, you were saying,  hey, he's so much more important than the secretary.  I think...  He is more important than the secretary,  but is he more important than the image?  Hello?  Oh, the ESPN?  Yeah, yeah, you know, the image they need to project.  I think that's what the week is for.  I think that's what they're trying to perfect with the week.  At least, I hope so. 
[00:38:30]  I never want to see a guy go down for something.  Sylvia, we do have experience with this, though.  When you get in trouble at the workplace  and they suspend you for a week,  a lot of times, like Anne said,  they use that week just to see who else is involved  and who else needs to be fired.  It's very rare.  It happened to us twice.  It's happened to friends of ours in the business as well.  That one-week suspension is always a prelude to being fired.  It really is.  It's time that they need to get their ducks in order 
[00:39:00]  to throw you out the fucking door.  Because they have to do it legally.  Yeah.  They want to see who else is involved.  Because the problem is,  this has happened in the work environment, too, at ESPN.  Yeah.  Which people take very seriously.  So they can get their rocks off, you know?  Yeah.  I mean, you know.  It would be nice to see that he keeps his job  because I think the two shouldn't be related.  We're not saying that we think it's good  and he should be fired.  No fucking way.  No.  We're just telling you what is going to happen  because, yeah, like Hope said,  we've been there a few times 
[00:39:30]  and this is how corporations act.  Right.  It's just a different world, my friend.  F-secretaries.  Well, in the 50s and 60s,  everybody was banging at work  and now you pinch a hiney  and you have problems with HR  and you're out the door.  Darren Stevens going out to a bar with Larry Tate.  Right.  A few doubles  and then they pinch some asses.  Sure.  Go home.  But what does Sam got to know?  She don't have to know.  She don't have to know nothing.  No.  Good old days. 
[00:40:00]  Let's go to psychotic.  Psychotic.  Yeah.  Hey, psychotic.  Her hair looks good.  Hey, this girl's Facebook,  her name is Brooke Hundley.  Okay.  It lists her as working for the Walt Disney Company.  That's a red flag that she's insane.  She's got to be nuts to work at that place.  Is ESPN Disney?  Yeah.  Disney owns ESPN.  Yeah, yeah.  She's telling the truth.  So technically she just does work for Disney.  So this is under the Disney corporate umbrella? 
[00:40:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, he's so fired.  So done.  Are you kidding me?  Now, if it was a homosexual affair,  Disney would probably be,  okay, this is cool.  You can't be.  Disney loves the gays.  The corporate umbrella?  Oh, he's so done.  Yeah.  ESPN fired Harold Reynolds a couple years ago,  who was way more popular than Steve Phillips,  for sexual harassment at ESPN  before it was even in the papers.  Like, just one day it was just Harold Reynolds fired.  This guy is so done.  So they suspended him before this even made the news. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, he's so done.  All right, let's go to Tom in New York.  Tom.  Yeah, that was my same line,  is that Reynolds was up first,  and because of that,  it was just a simple little allegation.  I mean, I don't think anything was ever proved,  and he was so gone, like, immediately.  Yeah.  All right, so this is not going to work out well  for Steve Phillips.  No.  Man, his career has gone slowly the wrong way, huh?  Yikes.  Let's go to Chisel in Pittsburgh.  Chisel. 
[00:41:30]  Good morning, boys.  Hey, man.  What's up, Chisel?  You guys are missing the big picture here.  Yeah, Steve Phillips is going to lose his job,  and that's going to happen,  but his potential side pussy  has just plummeted worse than that stock  that you and Ant bought.  Oh, Citadel?  Citadel.  I mean, his chances are slim to none  when he meets that girl in the bar,  and he says,  oh, yeah, my name is Steve Phillips, 
[00:42:00]  and right away they're going to think,  oh, fuck, no.  I ain't going down this road.  Right on, Chisel.  He's going to be working with his hand  and whatever he can pick up,  and he's going to be in the minor league this far.  I don't know.  Clean slate guy.  He could be clean slate guy.  No lunatic side piece  because, you know, he could dump her now  because, hey, he could just turn around  and go, hey, dummy.  He would be the dumbest man alive  if after this letter to his wife, 
[00:42:30]  he starts hanging out with this girl.  No.  She should be a dumbest kid.  He would be the dumbest man alive.  Done.  This girl has nothing but problems.  Yeah, throw her out,  and then the wife will be gone,  and he's ready for action.  Just in time for spring break.  Clean slate guy.  Of course, he'll live in a shithole  little apartment somewhere  instead of that lovely house  and have to give up all his money  and spend years perhaps in a courtroom. 
[00:43:00]  But sex, sex, sex.  See, and you're lucky.  I mean, in the end, you had enough money.  I mean, it still sucked  how much money you had to give out,  and it's just completely not fair.  It doesn't matter how much money you make.  The divorce thing is not fair to guys.  But we know stories of nameless people  where they had similar things happen to them,  and they weren't even cheating on the wife.  The wife just decided,  you know what, I'm done with this.  I mean, we tell a story of one guy 
[00:43:30]  that we knew pretty well  that made a lot of money in radio.  He wasn't on the air.  And he ended up living in a shithole apartment  in Manhattan,  gave up his beautiful house in the suburbs.  She got that.  He goes,  I can't afford to live.  How sad is that?  And he goes,  and I make a lot of money still.  How sad is that?  He goes,  I can't afford anything.  He said he was in a one-bedroom.  Yeah.  Not even a nice one in Manhattan.  And if you knew how much money this guy made, 
[00:44:00]  you know,  well over six figures.  Yeah.  Well over.  And...  Mid-six figures.  Let's just put it that way.  And there he was  in a little shithole place.  Right.  And his wife had the big...  Wife has the big house.  The big spread in the suburbs.  The big house that you bought  with all that nice cash that you earned.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, fuck.  Unless you were lucky enough to have,  you know,  enough money to kind of deal with it a little better.  This guy has a great line,  but he didn't leave his name  so he doesn't get credit,  but he wrote,  if you're going to cheat, 
[00:44:30]  keep it in the family,  like John Phillips.  Yeah.  Keep it in the family.  Keep it in the family.  Jesus Christ.  Let me go to John in North Carolina.  John?  Good evening.  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah.  Do you think this guy's waking up this morning  and for about the first five, ten seconds  he's forgot that he's totally fucked  and that his wife knows?  Oh, this is the Anthony bit. 
[00:45:00]  You got the music, Travis?  Here's Steve Phillips waking up.  Putting Anthony on the spot, I know, but...  Oh, Jesus.  What time is it?  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  God, I can't work or something.  God, it's...  Holy shit!  My wife knows I was cheating!  Oh, my God.  That chick wrote a letter.  Oh, fuck.  I'm fucked. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, I forgot I was sleeping!  I hate that.  You do when you wake up.  It sucks so bad.  It's so cruel.  But that shit works the other way, too,  when you have one of those crazy dreams.  Oh, crazy dreams.  When you wake up and realize it was a dream,  you're like, oh, my God.  Oh, jeez, I'm out of trouble.  Oh, man, I was in such trouble.  Yeah.  Oh, my God, was I screwed.  And I just had to wake up,  and now everything's fixed. 
[00:46:00]  You wake up, you're soaked.  Yeah.  You've been fighting demons all night long  and the FBI and allegations  and all sorts of shit.  I watch too much fucking forensic files  and those crime shows.  And they go to bed?  I just watched too much.  Jesus Christ.  There's just something going on.  Just caller.  No, no.  That ship has sailed.  Just caller.  You'd think that letter writing  for the chick was crazy.  Jesus Christ. 
[00:46:30]  I'd have killed for just a letter like that.  Oh, God.  I wonder if Keith gave that girl the pen  to write with.  You ever deal with Keith?  Yeah, he's been dealt with.  He's dealt with.  Like, what the fuck, dude?  He's been dealt with.  Here's a guy who got fired for the same thing.  Steve in Canada.  Steve.  Yes.  Hey.  I was solving a sort of situation one time before.  My who's.  I was kind of screwing my personal assistant. 
[00:47:00]  And lo and behold,  the employer found out about it,  got the old weak suspension,  and came back to a,  to a pump at the door.  So.  Yep.  Yeah.  That's all they do.  Yeah.  It's protocol to start with the suspension.  Oh, yeah.  Because that just calms everyone down  so everyone can breathe.  Okay.  What the fuck are we going to do here?  What does this contract say?  Is that going to be a problem?  Yep.  You know,  is she going to cause problems for the Disney Corporation?  Do we fire her,  or do we promote her to keep her happy? 
[00:47:30]  Yep.  That's what they're figuring out now.  Yeah, they all sit there.  All the lawyers sit there,  and they go over everything.  Textbook.  This is go over everything time,  and it keeps him out of the limelight,  because he still has this little grasp of hope  that he's going to keep his job.  So they tell him,  all right,  no statements,  don't say anything,  we'll deal with the PR on all this,  and meanwhile behind closed doors,  they're like,  all right,  we got to get rid of this motherfucker.  What are we looking at  as far as this contract goes?  What are we looking at as far as she goes? 
[00:48:00]  If we dump her,  is she going to come back  with a harassment suit on us?  This is all just posturing time.  How much does it suck that we know this?  I know.  Yeah.  It really bums me out  that I'm an expert at this.  I hate that we know this.  We've called it so many times.  We've been there.  We've been on the other side of that door.  Every DJ that gets suspended for a week,  we've called it.  There you go.  I think one time we weren't correct.  Hey,  what do you have up there,  Danny?  Some postings to a Facebook?  Mistress told son...  Posing...  Mistress told son 
[00:48:30]  posing as classmate.  Oh,  this was on his Facebook?  Yeah.  She said that she had overheard my mom  telling someone at my brother's baseball game  that my dad really likes someone at work  and is probably going to move out,  and if I need to talk to anyone,  she will be willing to listen  because her parents went through the same thing.  That's what the son told the cops.  She asked inappropriate questions about my parents  such as,  do they sleep in the same bed? 
[00:49:00]  Do you think they'll be getting a divorce?  Do they fight a lot?  The youth added.  Holy shit.  This girl is nuts.  She faked being just another...  A classmate of one of Steve Phillips' sons.  That's going through the same situation  and wanted to know if they sleep in the same bed.  Do they...  Do you hear moaning noises coming from mommy?  Oh, God.  Hmm.  Do you hear not in the shitter,  not in the shitter coming from their room? 
[00:49:30]  She's fucking nuts.  Damn.  This is a good question coming in from Kevin.  Kevin, what's up, buddy?  Good evening, Rape.  Hey, Kevin.  That's Phillip's family.  Can't stay out of the news.  First Mackenzie, now Steve.  Who's next?  Emo?  Jesus Christ.  Ba-dang.  Ba-dang, ba-dang, ba-dang.  Very good.  Let's see.  All right.  We'll go to Mike and Ron Concomo. 
[00:50:00]  Mike?  Hey, Mike.  Good morning, ba-ba-boy.  Hey.  This letter is just proof, you know, positive.  Again, these women aren't being sexually harassed.  I mean, it's clear that this woman was, you know, a willing participant in, you know,  sexual activity, just like the women involved in the David Letterman situation.  Yeah.  A lot of times harassment cases come after the scorning.  Everything's hunky-dory and cool right up until they get tossed or don't leave the wife or whatever the case may be. 
[00:50:30]  And then all of a sudden it's sexual harassment that they were doing and not, you know, bedding down consensually.  Right.  All right.  Punch it out.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Good pern.  That Mackenzie Phillips line or whatever, the John Phillips line was from Creepy Guy.  Yeah.  And he's called Creepy Guy because I'm at an Islander game and I tweeted a video or a picture.  I forgot exactly which one it was.  And so I'm reading my replies and a guy writes, nice seat. 
[00:51:00]  I'm eight rows behind you.  I'm the creepy guy, eight rows behind you.  Did you turn around?  So me and my girl at the exact same time turn around and there's a guy just waving.  Creepy Guy.  I thought it was someone, because you could just, you could be in fucking Wisconsin and write that same reply on a Twitter.  Yeah.  You know, just fuck around a little bit.  But for real, the guy was right there, eight rows behind you.  I'm eight rows behind you.  He turned out to be a really cool fan of the show, but very funny.  Until he writes a letter to your wife saying that you and him are a creepy guy. 
[00:51:30]  John in Alabama.  John.  Good morning, my boy.  Hey, John.  I just wanted to point out just the wonderful days of our beautiful Justice Clarence Thomas and Miss Anita Hill.  This lady's probably going to end up having Chris Berman's nutsack in her mouth, keeping her job while Phillips gets tossed to the wolves.  You think she keeps her job?  I think she does.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I've seen it happen.  I work for a large corporation. 
[00:52:00]  The guy gets axed, loses his wife, his family, everything else.  And then the girl gets promoted because they don't want to fire her.  You know, so she ends up suing them.  Yeah, because she could turn around and get the shit out of them.  Right, right, right.  He was an older man.  He influenced, you know, he's this influential guy.  And I looked up to him and he, you know, lied to me.  He told me he'd fire me if I didn't bend up.  Yeah.  All right, I like working this stuff out right in front of everybody. 
[00:52:30]  So Steve Phillips, one-week suspension.  He'll be fired.  Gone.  Eh, within a week, maybe slightly over a week, he definitely will be fired from ESPN.  See, this is the show you've got to listen to because the regular media doesn't deal with this crap.  No, no, they don't.  We were all over the Balloon Boy hoax way before anyone else.  Remember that?  Yes, yes.  So Steve Phillips is in about a week, maybe slightly more than a week, fired.  She keeps her job.  Not sure about a promotion because that looks a little too suspicious, but she just keeps her job for now. 
[00:53:00]  Yep.  Keeps her job for now.  They'll put her somewhere where, you know, she's tucked away.  They'll probably tell her not to talk about this.  And the wife, who probably was aware of all this crap for the most part, now has to deal with it.  She probably didn't want to deal with it.  So now she'll have to file for divorce to save face with her friends.  Oh, yes.  How is she going to go around her little community?  Right.  Uh, where, when her husband's been, uh, dicking this fucking chick.  Right.  How old's the wife? 
[00:53:30]  Any, um...  82.  Any info?  82.  Yeah.  82 years young.  How old's he?  He looks, uh...  What?  He's 46?  He's what?  46.  God damn, do I look good for my age.  Well, he's a little, he's greasy.  I would have said mid-50s.  If you were fucking dealing with the Mets, you'd be gray, too.  You're just a fan.  Right.  Imagine having to actually deal with them.  Right.  Yeah, he had some rough years there.  Uh...  All right. 
[00:54:00]  I don't know.  The phones are lit, but I guess we've pretty much done this story for now.  That's a good one.  We'll see if there's more, um, more facts coming out as the show goes on.  Yes.  Yeah, it's a biggie.  So there you go.  Yankees one game away from going to the World Series.  And...  That's it.  And Steve Phillips one week away from being fired from ESPN.  Yep.  You watch.  In our humble opinion.  You watch.  We know how this shit works.  Ah, yeah.  All right.  Wow.  Rich Voss, Bill Burr, and, uh, Jason Ellis all gonna be on the show today. 
[00:54:30]  My goodness.  Red Dragons.  Red Dragons.  O.P. Anthony.  Got that right.  A couple things hitting today.  I found this interesting, but it's gonna drive Anthony a little nuts.  Uh-oh.  Because he doesn't like this band whatsoever.  Whatsoever.  Pearl Jam.  Oh.  Launches a BlackBerry app.  Red BlackBerry app. 
[00:55:00]  To download live tracks.  Red BlackBerry app.  Red BlackBerry.  Red BlackBerry.  Red BlackBerry.  Red BlackBerry.  Oh, yeah.  That's kind of cool.  Is it?  No?  What's a BlackBerry app?  Is it good?  How many apps are there?  You know what?  I don't have a BlackBerry app.  There's an app for everything.  I'm embarrassed because I don't have one.  You got Apple.  I don't have one BlackBerry app.  You know?  I'm embarrassed to say that.  And then I started searching around. 
[00:55:30]  I don't even know where to begin because now there's like 10,000, 20,000 apps.  I'm like, ah!  See?  I'm trying to figure out what book to read.  I don't know where to begin.  I think according to the latest iPhone commercial that's running, they have about 85,000 apps.  Yeah, I saw that recently, too.  I just threw 10,000, 20,000 for the BlackBerry.  It's probably a lot less than that, I would imagine.  BlackBerry.  Like, I don't even know.  Where do you go for that?  Dude, my iPhone is just sitting on my desk.  Yeah.  Rings every once in a while with wrong numbers. 
[00:56:00]  That's funny.  I turn it on every once in a while to listen to the show because they got that Sirius XM app.  Yeah.  But I stare at it every day and I'm like, just make the switch.  Just do it.  Do it.  And then I look to my right and there's my old friend, the BlackBerry.  Do it.  Come on.  And it's kind of starting to look old and kind of like out of date.  Yeah.  And I walk by my cell phone store almost every day because it's just one of my routines.  And I look in the window just hoping that I see that brand new BlackBerry getting ready. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  To be sold.  What's that fucking...  And it's just not happening.  And I'm trying to hang in there because I do like the BlackBerry a lot.  You're not excited for the Storm 2?  I don't know.  What are they saying about the Storm 2?  Oh, it's probably going to be even better than the first one.  What happened with the Storm 1?  That sucked.  My cell phone guy, though, was cool.  He goes, dude, the Storm...  This is him speaking.  I don't want to be sued by nobody from the BlackBerry company.  He goes, it's a piece of shit.  Do not buy it.  Well, I can speak from experience.  He said, do not buy it. 
[00:57:00]  So I ended up getting the updated curve.  It was a giant piece of shit.  And people say, oh, no, dude, you got to upgrade the firmware, get the different firmware.  So, you know, I jumped through the hoops.  You do the install.  It's like a whole technical thing.  I put the different firmware on from, like, some United Kingdom provider.  Oh, shit.  It was half a percent less shitty.  And then I finally, I was trying to take a picture with it.  And it just wouldn't, like, it would focus and the light would come on.  But it wouldn't actually snap the picture.  Right.  I tried it four times.  I got so frustrated.  I just punched it until the screen actually flew off. 
[00:57:30]  Right.  And I said, fuck it.  I hate this thing.  My cell phone guy said, he goes, just don't touch this thing.  You will not be happy.  I will tell you this much.  The camera on my BlackBerry blows yours away on the iPhone.  Really?  Yeah, but I can't do the, but your video on the iPhone is way better than the video on  the BlackBerry.  The video is really good on the iPhone.  Hence why I have to walk around with my flip all the time.  See?  I want everything in one fucking phone.  One handy dandy phone.  What have they been advertising now that's kind of bashing the fucking iPhone with their 
[00:58:00]  commercial, the droid?  Yeah, well, that's like the Android.  Android is Google's software.  Yeah.  But Google doesn't make any hardware.  I think if Google made hardware, it might be interesting.  But if it's just software and they're just going to ship it out with different manufacturers'  hardware, I don't see what the point is.  You know what one of their selling points is that's ridiculous?  It's like pretty much saying the iPhone doesn't have a keyboard.  It's like, yeah.  It's great that it doesn't have a fucking keyboard.  I don't need a keyboard.  It's got a great fucking touch screen that works fucking perfect. 
[00:58:30]  Buttons don't get stuck, you know?  Yeah.  One of their selling points was like a great thing that the iPhone had.  I'll tell you this much.  If there's not a BlackBerry on the market in time for Christmas that I love, I think  2010 is the year of the fucking iPhone.  You're switching over?  For the opster.  My brother did that.  For the fucking opster.  He switched over and then he couldn't stop fucking raving about it.  And I was like day one, I had an iPhone. 
[00:59:00]  So pretty much went through the good, the bad, any of that shit.  And I love it.  So to hear somebody that just got an iPhone just raving about it, it's like, well, yeah.  But it's funny because it is on my desk and it does like ring every once in a while just  to tell me it's there.  Hello, I'm here.  And then I answer the phone to some dummy that's looking for some long lost friend.  I'm like, I'm not your long lost friend.  I don't know what happened to them.  This is my phone now.  Go away.  Here are my two big problems now with the iPhone.  Now, of course, there was the video problem and then you couldn't text pictures. 
[00:59:30]  Now that's back.  Now that's back.  And we got it.  But now the problem I have, I would like them to run flash on this so I could get flash.  Not a flash for the camera.  The flash app, you know, so I watch flash videos.  And the fucking battery does kind of suck.  If I don't charge it like...  What happened to the battery that was going to be charged by the sun? 
[01:00:00]  What?  Remember that?  What movie was that from?  No, they said...  What was it?  No, Apple patented the technology.  Oh, okay, but they're not really...  So it doesn't mean that...  Okay, all right, I got you.  And the fact that you can't run things in the background.  Like apps, if you have an app going and somebody texts you, it just shuts your fucking shit off.  Oh, that's dumb.  That's stupid.  That really is stupid.  But eventually, I'm sure they'll fix that.  All right.  I'm sure they will.  The genius is over there.  You've got to charge...  I mean, it's definitely a once-a-day phone as far as charging goes. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can't go out without your charger if you're going to be gone the whole day.  But it's a computer.  I'm saying, like...  It is a computer.  I use it enough that the battery should be drained, you know?  It's my computer.  I know.  I do the same thing.  I'm watching a lot of video on it.  I'm fucking...  I'm using it.  Facebook.  It's not just sitting in my fucking pocket.  There's sometimes I drive home and the screen never turns off because I'm always doing something.  As you're driving.  Oh, really?  It's like 45 minutes of straight use.  Of course.  And then I'm like, oh, I'm fucking better than you. 
[01:01:00]  It's like, why?  You ever texting shit when you're driving?  You know, you're not supposed to do that and I don't recommend it or anything.  But you ever texting while you're driving and you kind of...  You go like, I bet I could get that whole word in before I look up.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's like, I bet I could get that whole word in before I even look up.  And then as you're texting, you're like, I hope nothing's going on in front of me.  Because I think I-N-G.  All right.  I will guarantee that I'll be in a fender bender.  I'm not even... 
[01:01:30]  I just know it's just a matter of time.  Thank God I got a pretty good car that'll, you know, help me when I do, you know, crash  into someone in front of me.  It's a challenge.  My girl's like, what are you doing?  I'm like, I'm writing...  What?  I'm writing an email and I'm checking my websites.  What's wrong with you?  It's a challenge.  The scariest thing...  She's like, you're going 70 on the New Jersey Turnpike?  Oh.  Well, the scariest thing ever was me and my friend Ziggy.  We drove to West Virginia, right, to go rafting.  It's an eight-hour drive.  Fuck, what kind of rafting? 
[01:02:00]  Whitewater rafting.  Why don't you fucking invite me next time?  Oh, damn.  See, I'm not a big drinker, Dan, but I'll do stuff like that with you in a second.  Because I know you want to bond a little bit.  Next time we go, I'll definitely go to work with Danny and Ziggy.  That's worse than Danny and me.  Zig's really bad, too.  Oh, are you drinking rafting?  Zig's really bad.  We went to Texas.  You drink after the rafting.  That's what's so cool about it.  We went to Texas last month for vacation.  Where, you know, you basically start at the top of this mountain.  Oh, are you talking about floating?  No, no, no, no. 
[01:02:30]  Floating's cool, too.  We did real rafting, too, but we did the floating, too.  Where we went to...  We just put the keg on a fucking...  Yeah, that shit rules.  I haven't done that in a while, but that shit rules.  And we had five tubes, because it was three people and two coolers full of beer.  Yeah, I know.  No, that's not crazy, though.  But anyway, the crazy thing was, we were driving down to West Virginia, and he had a laptop,  and he has a business, so he's trying to run his business and drive at the same time.  Holy shit, that's even worse.  There were periods of about, like, 40 seconds where he was just, you know, typing on his laptop. 
[01:03:00]  He has, like, a little mount or whatever.  And he would know if he was drifting, because he would feel the rumble strip.  He'd always make sure to drift.  He'd be in the left lane, and he'd make sure to drift to the left.  And if he felt the rumble strip, he would come back over.  See, that's smart.  Eight and a half hours of that.  Ah, that's frightening.  The entire way there.  But you get out of the northeast, they have the lights on the highways, too, that are bumps.  All those reflectors, yeah.  Reflectors, whatever.  So if you veer to the right, you're going to hit some bumps before you're going to, like, go into another lane.  When are we going to get that sonar technology?  You need that. 
[01:03:30]  Then we could really be rocking that.  That Minority Report car, where you just chill, and the thing drives itself.  They have a few cars out now that have that.  I saw the commercial, but I don't know anyone that has one of those.  I don't either.  You know what you need?  Kind of a plug-in where you get a heads-up display.  You need a HUD, like a fucking fire plane, where it's on your windshield.  And this was something we goofed on a while back, because it's like, why not just call the person then?  Voice-activated texting.  Right.  Where you say the word, and it texts it to people, because you don't want to talk to people. 
[01:04:00]  You just want to fucking get your shit out there.  And it's right on the windshield.  So, like a fighter pilot, you could look at your shit, your display, what you're texting, and talk and still see beyond that.  Right.  That's where we've got to head.  And you know what?  I've talked about it a bunch, but I officially have stopped answering my phone.  Officially.  That's it.  Now, no more calls.  It doesn't matter who calls.  Like, if someone calls, I'll look to see you call. 
[01:04:30]  They'll go, oh, my sister.  And then I'll type her a little message.  Hi, how are you?  This is what I do.  I'm not taking phone calls.  But I wait for her to stop calling and maybe leave a voicemail, and then I'm like, hey, what's going on?  Missed your call.  No reason for phone calls anymore.  I do not fucking answer this as a phone anymore.  I was listening to the news this morning, driving in, and their technology person on 88, on CBS radio, on the news,  said that emails are still the number one way people communicate with each other, but that is not going to last for long. 
[01:05:00]  Texting is huge.  Which is an email.  And Twitter.  Who are we kidding?  It really is.  It's just an email.  What's the difference?  It's an email.  It doesn't have a header on it.  Right.  Something like that.  Wow, what's different?  You get it right away.  It's more convenient than a fucking email.  It's just confusing.  BlackBerry message, text message, email.  Same exact thing.  Same thing.  You're reading words that somebody just wrote to you. 
[01:05:30]  Okay, let's say hi to Elise.  Is it Elise?  Yes, it is.  Hi, Elise in Boston.  How are you?  Ashton.  I'm all right.  Is there snow on the ground up there?  What?  Snow on the ground.  Um, it did snow over the weekend, but it didn't accumulate.  Thank God.  I'm not ready yet.  What do you think of Brady?  Are you a Brady fan?  I like baseball.  And I don't want to talk about the Red Sox, all right?  Oh, shit.  I hear you.  All right.  Poor Red Sox.  Well, you've got the Celtics to look forward to now. 
[01:06:00]  Uh, I really just like baseball.  That's all right.  Oh, well.  Dude.  We're beating up on your team, the team that beat you.  It's okay.  How many calls are we going to take from Boston where they're white and they don't want to  acknowledge basketball?  It's just amazing.  The most racist city in America.  We've done the bit.  You guys don't want to acknowledge the Celtics.  Hey, I know plenty of white people here that love basketball.  Yeah.  What do you got on the new BlackBerry?  That's why you call it, it looks like.  Yeah, I mean, I'm a techie dork, so I really follow up on this stuff. 
[01:06:30]  And, uh, there is, you have T-Mobile, right?  I'm AT&T.  Oh.  Ah.  Well, yeah, I thought the Curve 8900, that's what I have, is for T-Mobile.  And rumor has it, on November 11th, they're coming out with a new version of the Bold for  T-Mobile, and it has 3G and the 5.0 OS.  And then all the bells and whistles, and my 8900 is still in great condition, but I'm 
[01:07:00]  going to get that new phone just for the 3G.  What kind of browser?  Do you have that immobile fucking browser?  Do you have WAP?  I hated that.  WAP.  Fucking WAP.  It's like, I want to go to a website on my phone.  No, sorry.  We don't have WAP.  The WAP hates WAP.  Yes, WAP hates WAP.  Wap, wap.  Huh?  They are improving on the browser, but, uh, they do have third-party ones like, uh, Opera  and all that.  Yeah. 
[01:07:30]  Well, I'm, I'm officially in the world where the new phone comes out, I get it immediately.  That wasn't the case a few years ago.  I would go, you know what, I could deal with my old phone for another six months or so.  That was me.  But now it's like, as soon as the phone comes out, I'm there.  They got me.  In the same way.  They got me.  Yeah, because I mean, they're, they're really, everything that I'm missing in the phone,  then they come out with, and the next version, and.  Yeah.  You know I was buying phones every fucking six months, I would buy a new phone.  Right.  I was buying phones like a madman. 
[01:08:00]  Me too, and I don't even make the amount of money you make, that's for sure.  See, haha, who does?  I don't have a problem.  Once I got the iPhone, though, it's like, yeah, you get the upgrades and shit like that,  and updates, things, and, and it's like getting a new phone.  It is.  All I want, all I want in a new BlackBerry is much better video capability.  That's it.  Everything else I'm happy with, because I'm not like, I don't use my phone as much as  Anthony does for all that other stuff.  I want video rules.  Yeah. 
[01:08:30]  All right, but.  It's my third BlackBerry, so.  But I don't take my computer to, like, when I, when I go on the, if I'm going on the road  for like a day or two days, I'm staying in town to do fucking Red Eye or something like  that, I don't have to take my computer anymore.  I don't know, I used to, you know, put the laptop in the bag and take, cart that fucking  thing around.  Don't need a computer for what I'm, you know, doing in the hotel room.  Right.  Just checking emails, fucking stuff like that.  The porn is a little small to jack off to, but it's possible.  It's jack offable.  It's jack offable. 
[01:09:00]  The screen is jack off onable.  It gets the job done.  Yes, it gets the job done.  All right.  Thank you, Elise.  Good phone call.  We're going to go to Chris in Texas.  Chris, how are you?  Hey, Opie, how are you?  What's up?  Now, listen, I just wanted to tell you, go ahead and pull the trigger, buy that new  iPhone, because I was a Windows mobile user up until just a few days ago, and I bought  the 32 gig 3GS for myself and the 16 gig 3GS for my girlfriend, and I absolutely freaking 
[01:09:30]  love it.  And my girlfriend, who is not technically proficient at all, didn't even know how to check on email,  I had her up and running and checking email in less than a day.  It's just one of those things.  It's that easy.  I mean, it really is that easy to use, to set up, and it's just amazing at how much stuff  you can actually do with this phone.  Yeah, with all the apps and everything. 
[01:10:00]  You know, you got that.  One I use a lot is Around Me.  You know the Around Me app?  Is that where?  You just click it.  It knows where you are and shit like that, and then you can look up anything you need.  What do you need?  You need parking, you need pubs, restaurants, taxis, supermarkets, theaters, fucking hospitals,  gas stations.  What?  Have you heard of Monocle?  Monocle?  What the hell is Monocle?  Yelp and Urban Spoon use it, where instead of it showing you what's around you, you put 
[01:10:30]  your camera up to whatever street, and it will show you in your camera what's near you.  How fucked is that?  It's really cool.  Can you get that for the BlackBerry?  No, of course you can't.  I like the little blinking radar thing that shows which direction you're facing when you're  going around, you turn around.  I sit on the shitter sometimes and just turn the compass and go, look at me, I'm shitting  facing northeast.  Just so I know. 
[01:11:00]  Let's go to Mousy in Alabama.  Mousy.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  You may want to look into the HTC Hero.  I think that's probably the best, if not better, competitor to Apple's iPhone.  Everything you guys just mentioned, like about being able to find locations around you and  the whole video, being able to see, you know, the whole alternate reality stuff where you  hold up your phone.  The HTC Hero does it just as good, if not better.  I've been using it for the past couple of weeks, and me and my friends have this pissing concept,  and every time he shows me an app, I show him the same app on my phone, maybe the same, 
[01:11:30]  if not better.  It's unbelievable.  I say unbelievable.  I agree.  Why did Sam go, ugh, to this phone call?  Sam.  Because if you don't have a BlackBerry or an iPhone, that's the argument.  There's no other smartphone that's an iPhone killer.  Oh, shit.  It's no Windows Mobile.  Have you seen Steve's phone?  Yes, I have seen Steve's phone.  Let me ask you a question.  Sam, does your BlackBerry have a stylus?  No, I know.  Anthony, does your iPhone have a stylus?  No.  Then shut the fuck up. 
[01:12:00]  Steve has a stylus?  I don't know.  Steve does.  A stylus.  The only other person that has a stylus is Rich Voss, and we know how dumb he is.  A stylus.  We'll be in here in a half hour.  Fantastic.  All right.  Let's go to Brian in Carolina.  Brian.  Stylus.  Hey, Ope.  Good morning, guys.  Good morning.  Hi.  Listen, Ope, on your BlackBerry, you should have a new icon that came out like two months  ago that is the BlackBerry icon in black.  App World.  Well, where the fuck is that, Sam? 
[01:12:30]  I bet you have it.  If not, we'll make sure you do.  How do I find it?  It should be in your, you know, on your, on your, not on your home screen, but on the  Oh, this sounds complicated already.  I scroll, look.  I don't see nothing that looks like a BlackBerry thing.  There you go over there.  What do you mean, there you go over there?  Why can't you just touch the screen and get to it?  I don't know.  Look, I'm touching it.  I see you're scrolling with a scroll thing, and then you got to get the little square highlight  thing, and then you got to hit a button.  I'm so sick of that. 
[01:13:00]  It's the future.  Touch screen.  Let me tell you about the scroll thing.  Yeah.  Because I'm an OCD freak.  I brick break my ass off.  That fucking scroll thing has to be replaced every two months.  I wear it down.  From brick break.  Oh, you couldn't find it, huh, Sam?  You want to know how easy it is to get the Pearl Jam app on your BlackBerry?  You probably just did it in two seconds.  No, no, no.  To get the application, you text PJ to 5509, and then you click on the link from their 
[01:13:30]  BlackBerry browser.  Really?  Yeah, so you don't have to go into any pesky app store.  Oh, yeah.  That's so hard to go to the app store right there.  It's too hard.  We have an app store, Opie.  Don't listen to them.  Where the fuck is that thing?  I'll put it on your phone.  We have an app store.  Yeah, me and Sam do the BlackBerry.  They don't know what they're talking about.  Yeah, that's what it is.  Can't find the app store for Opie.  It's not on his phone yet.  I'll put it on.  Yeah, we're going to find that.  I'm going to be apping my ass off later today.  I'm going to have to put my app store on.  What's the best app for the BlackBerry? 
[01:14:00]  No, the app store comes with the fucking thing.  Why is everyone talking at the same time?  I'll tell you this.  Where am I?  BlackBerry has better Twittering than iPhone.  Oh, shit.  Uber Twitter is better than anything on the iPhone.  Stop it.  Everybody wants me to go to Uber Twitter.  Uber Twitter is the best.  Dude, I Twitter my fucking videos up on Twitter later.  Or Tweety 2.  Twitter later is great because you get a preview pic of whatever anybody posts.  Yes.  So I don't have to click on everyone's picture.  Exactly. 
[01:14:30]  Uber Twitter.  Correctamundo.  Uber Twitter already had that.  That's it.  I'm pretty sure I have.  Shut it.  All right.  Old news.  Let me say hi to Adam in Illinois.  Adam.  Good evening, boy.  We're talking about the future.  Yes.  Technology.  What's up?  In my semi, I have an Eaton Vorrat system that if I veer to the right or the left without  a turn signal, a rumble strip sound goes on that side of the vehicle, so I got a speaker  on the right, speaker on the left, and it'll tell me that I'm veering out of my lane. 
[01:15:00]  Or if a car cuts me off and I got the cruise control on and they're going slower than me,  it'll automatically set the engine brake in my semi and slow me down so I don't crash  into them.  That's pretty cool.  But that never happens.  No one ever cuts in front of you and then goes slower than you were going.  Ever.  Machine guns should come out of your headlights.  You want to run them right off the road.  So that's cool.  It makes a rumble sound. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, but then you've got to use your blinker, I guess, huh?  What fun is that?  Don't think if you're swerving.  What fun is weaving through traffic if you're using a blinker?  I'm in a semi.  I try to signal.  It's even better.  Right on.  All right.  The Cadillac has a commercial out now.  They're putting it into the new Cadillacs.  Right.  Oh.  Yeah, it's about time we make driving safer.  I mean, it's only the year 2009.  I mean, take the human element out of the loop.  Let's make it a little safer.  Take the human element out of the loop of driving. 
[01:16:00]  Right.  Put all the responsibility on a computer chip under your hood.  That's what I say.  And for the people that build the highways, 2009, let's not build oncoming traffic zooming  by your fucking left ear anymore.  We don't need to do that.  You're just depending on somebody else not veering into you head on.  Right.  That had a bad day.  Someone's a little depressed.  How about new roads and highways?  We build a big fucking wall in between the oncoming traffic.  Someone's trying to text a real long word without looking up first. 
[01:16:30]  We don't need to do that anymore.  I'm sure in the day we had to do that for whatever reason.  We don't have to anymore.  Yeah.  You know?  Come on.  This guy's in the cell phone business, Tom.  Going to get to the end of the cell phone business.  Tom?  Tom?  We lose you?  I'm sorry about that.  His cell phone doesn't work.  I think you need to go Android, like the other guy said, with the HTC Hero.  But do you work for the Android company?  No.  No, I do not.  No, I do not.  So you're independent and you're saying the Android is the phone to have? 
[01:17:00]  No.  The phone to have.  Well, Android is a platform.  It's no S.  It's not a phone.  I don't know.  Yes.  I don't know this shit, Danny.  If you're going to go Android, HTC Hero is probably the way to go.  Dude, I've used Android.  I don't like it.  It stinks.  This guy's in the business.  He's trying to sell you Chulie's gum.  I'm not trying to sell you any.  Cancer merchant.  Cancer merchant.  Why don't you just have some Chulie's gum?  I'm telling you, I would say go Android.  They're saying by 2012, that'll be the second most popular operating system. 
[01:17:30]  Behind the iPhone.  Behind the iPhone.  The second most behind the iPhone.  So get it now.  Not behind the iPhone.  You know what?  I'm making a statement right now.  To the original software that they wrote, you know, software they wrote for cell phones.  Tom, let me show you how dumb that statement was.  I'm making a statement right now.  I'm coming out with a cell phone.  It's going to be the third best cell phone by the year 2013.  That's right.  He makes it great. 
[01:18:00]  That's right.  That's right.  I said it here first.  I just need a name for it.  Where did I get one?  In three years, his outdated software will be number two.  Tom, that was a bad statement, my friend.  It was terrible.  By the way, you're in the business and your cell phone sucks.  It's crackling.  It is crackling.  That's the FDR drive for you.  All right.  Yeah.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  You want to talk about the future?  I love technology from the future.  Let's go to Tom.  Tom.  Hello. 
[01:18:30]  What's up, Tom?  Morning, guys.  Good morning, Tom.  Speak.  Hey, I was just telling you, the Prius has a system on it that has a camera up in the headliner  that watches the road.  It's an option.  It'll actually watch the lines in the road, and it will steer the car lightly through the  turns and everything in the lane.  That's a little crazy.  I don't think I like that.  What if the line is painted like into an abutment? 
[01:19:00]  Well, if it can't see the line very well, it actually will shut off.  But if it can't see the lines, it'll actually steer the car.  See, I like this technology, because there's a lot of dummies out on that road.  Yeah.  I like it that maybe some of these dummies will have the technology.  I wouldn't mind that, as long as it works.  You know, I don't know about that autopilot shit.  Eventually, it'll just malfunction and drive you off the road.  Yeah, it will end up driving you into a bridge and head on into traffic, something. 
[01:19:30]  Fuck, that GPS is dangerous.  Yeah.  When it basically says, turn left now, and you're at a red light, like, I gotta turn!  It told me to!  I catch myself at the last second a lot of times, like, wait, it's telling me to turn,  but wait, I can't turn?  Yeah.  This car's coming.  You notice on the GPS, they make you sign a disclaimer.  They say, you know, you gotta control the car, and they say, you gotta press I agree before  you can even use it. 
[01:20:00]  Right.  Yeah, that's a binding fucking contract.  It's not pressing a touch screen.  Yes, let me just touch this.  Yes, okay.  All right.  All right, guys.  Thank you, sir.  I hate the navigation in the Escalade, because you can't work it while you're moving.  So there are times I'm stopped at a light, and you're trying to put the fucking info in  real quick, and then you start moving, and you're like, I gotta wait till the next light.  I don't know where I'm going.  I was just talking about this with somebody recently, because it's in most cars now. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  Where, yeah, if you're moving, you can't really just start punching away with your GPS.  So stupid, come on.  It would be so easy to fix.  Well, you turn the screen so the passenger could see it, and then at least the passenger  could punch in shit while you're driving.  Why not have that technology?  Because, I mean, you as the driver, it would be useless to you at that point if the whole  screen is turned to the passenger side.  And then it gets around that whole thing. 
[01:21:00]  You know what people would do, though?  Turn it to the passenger side, then try to drive and lean over.  Now it's ten times as dangerous.  Well, do it in such a way that it's impossible.  And then there you go.  You've solved a problem that a lot of us have.  Because then at least, you know, the co-pilot there could be punching in addresses.  At least it's just a sensor like that turns on and off the airbag in the front seat.  If somebody's sitting in the front seat and you have a passenger, then the fucking navigation  works.  Just do it that way.  Right. 
[01:21:30]  Enough.  There you go.  I hate that.  You're punching it in.  And then someone pissed off behind you because you're almost done, but you're just barely  moving just to get those last few letters of the city in.  Right.  All right.  Technology.  Do you want to continue with the future?  The future.  Science.  Let me go to Dave.  Hi, Dave.  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Pretty good, man.  Hi, Dave.  Oh, baby, guys.  You just pull that trigger.  There's an app on the iPhone that'll allow you to use the camera behind it to point it 
[01:22:00]  to the road in front of you while you're texting your message.  So you just look at your iPhone.  Oh, I've seen that.  It's awesome.  Yeah, yeah.  Now, if you hold up the phone.  Because I usually just hold up my BlackBerry, like, on the dashboard as I'm driving.  Right, right.  So I sort of feel like I'm still looking at the road.  So this, though, it shows your text and everything that you're doing.  But it also, in the background, shows what the camera is seeing.  So you can see the road and everything as you're texting. 
[01:22:30]  Sort of like, you know.  That's cool.  You're watching a little movie going, wow, this guy's going to get in an accident.  Look at that car.  It's dead stopped.  And it's just, this guy's still going.  What an asshole.  Oh, that's cool, Dave.  Pull the trigger, man.  You got to do it.  It's time.  It's 2009.  It's sitting on my desk.  It blinks every once in a while.  We're wrong number.  It's ready to be used.  Thank you, sir.  Anyone else?  There's a million. 
[01:23:00]  Verizon is fast tracking their 4G network because they are getting the iPhone.  When the trackball stops working on a BlackBerry, flip it onto a piece of paper and roll it.  And it's fixed.  Oh, wow.  That's good.  I do that with my iPhone all the time.  Trackball is yesterday's news.  When the touch screen doesn't work, you know, you rub it on paper.  What?  The trackball is yesterday's news.  I'm on my shirt.  Every so often you just go like this.  There you go.  All the new BlackBerrys are coming out with the pads.  There's no trackball on new BlackBerrys anymore.  I think it's a whistle.  Well, how am I going to play Brick Breaker? 
[01:23:30]  Well, it has a pad instead of a trackball.  It's going to be great.  Uh-oh, I think I just broke my BlackBerry.  Don't fidget with your phone.  Why?  You're going to break it.  Here's one fucked up thing about the iPhone,  but you kind of learn how to get around it.  It's a little workaround.  You have to wipe the lens off every time you take a picture.  Because the way you position your hand to press the top button and things like that  just smears grease.  The lens.  Greasy Dago grease on me all over the fucking lens. 
[01:24:00]  So you take a picture and it's got this angelic kind of glowy light thing going on.  Sometimes it makes the picture very attractive.  It makes it look like there might be a ghost.  Yeah.  Other times you want a clear picture.  So you've got to wipe that bitch off.  A lot of phones, but I think we're going to move on to other things.  I think we did our future break pretty well.  Up to date as far as the future goes.  The future.  Can we get a little sweeper when we talk about the future? 
[01:24:30]  Yes, the future.  Hope you're going to have to talk about the future.  Rich Voss has a new phone.  Ah, he was rich in his fucking fag bag.  His phone with his stylus.  No, you got an iPhone.  What the fuck?  You got an iPhone?  Oh, wow.  Someone was selling one online?  I guarantee you didn't fucking buy it brand new.  You found that on Craigslist.  With this iPhone?  Yeah.  What are you kidding me?  I won it on the golf course.  Oh, you won it on the golf course?  I know you didn't buy it at a store.  No, I did buy it. 
[01:25:00]  Not only have I bought this, and I bought my two daughters two new Blackberries.  Oh.  Right?  Are you digging the iPhone?  What's that?  Are you digging the iPhone?  I can't find the game I want.  What game?  Scrabble.  They got Scrabble?  You just go to the app store and put Scrabble in it.  Excuse me, I'm talking to Opie and Anthony.  All right?  When I need some technical support, then you jump in, stupid.  And that's what happened.  I'm tired of you.  Okay, I'm on Patricia's side now. 
[01:25:30]  All right?  This is headliner phone.  I don't fuck around with a palm or any of that shit.  He's got a fucking iPhone.  He's got an iPhone, yeah.  He's had an iPhone for over a year.  He gives him all that shit and then turns to Danny and goes, how did you get to Scrabble?  Now he realizes Danny can help him.  The best part of Voss's argument, he goes, when I need technical information, then I'll  ask you.  And I'll be like, well, that's just what happened.  You're a good point.  I don't think you should be playing Scrabble. 
[01:26:00]  Just put Scrabble.  Go to the app store.  Hold on, hold on.  You gotta know how to spell Scrabble now.  Do you know how to spell Scrabble?  S-C-R-A-B-B-L-E.  Oh, look.  He's got his glasses.  He's reading glasses.  I got two pairs.  I got these on my...  Oh, can I see your glasses?  So you can break them?  No.  No, I would like to see them just see if they work.  Yeah.  Because I am at the point now, dude, I held out for a long-ass time.  You better guess the fucking specs.  My peepers have been fucking magnificent, knock wood, for many years, but that close-up 
[01:26:30]  reading shit now is fucking infuriating me.  Well, our phones are making us blind.  I'm squinty guy.  It's because of the phones.  Yes.  The text on this shit.  When you go for a full fucking website on these phones, oh my God, the letters are  like...  Well, I take two fingers on the touch screen and open it up so it's big.  And then you scroll around with your finger.  Yeah, I'm not allowed to do that on my blackberry.  Oh, you can't make it bigger?  No, no.  Oh, that's a shame.  You can zoom in.  No, you can't.  You can zoom.  Do you turn it sideways and make it...  We can zoom a little bit. 
[01:27:00]  It's a square screen.  Oh, shit.  It's $5.  $5?  Uh-oh.  I've got to think about that one.  But it's a good thing.  Is it $5 one time, one time only?  One time.  What the fuck's wrong with you?  Five fucking dollars for your...  $5.  Let me get my coffee first.  Oh, I could use some coffee.  Any coffee people around?  Do you have this phone?  You don't have this.  No, I do.  You just missed the whole break.  I got an iPhone on my desk and I got a Blackberry that I use.  The iPhone was given to me by SiriusXM, which was a nice gesture. 
[01:27:30]  So I could check out our show and other channels on the iPhone.  Oh, you can get radio and shit on the studio?  Oh, that's the best part about it.  Rich Foster.  You can get XM on it?  You can get our show.  So you're on the road.  You just punch up an app and you can be listening to us.  And get XM and listen to me.  How the fuck?  Do you got to pay for it?  Oh, yeah.  Well, you got to pay for that.  I don't think I would have to.  Oh, wait, wait.  Danny's showing him something.  Oh, we're going to do some SiriusXM during a break for old Richie Voss.  One other question. 
[01:28:00]  What was I going to ask you?  Can I see your iPhone?  No.  I'll smash it.  I'll smash it.  Huh?  You're going to smash a $2,000 phone?  $2,000 phone.  Gold-plated on the inside.  So it can't fuck up your head, the brain waves?  Oh, the brain tumor.  But no one fucking uses it as a phone anymore.  Now you're just going to get thumb cancer.  Finger tumors.  Right.  Wow, there's a couple questions so I can get XM on it.  What was the one I was going to ask you?  Oh, Twitter. 
[01:28:30]  You can send pictures on Twitter like you do that all the time.  How fucking behind are you?  Wow.  Yes, you can.  How behind are you?  Yes, you can.  I was sending fucking pictures last February.  What's wrong with you?  Oh, fuck.  I missed all those sunsets.  Yeah.  So is that hard to learn?  No.  Like if you send a picture like say of your girl or something, would that be considered  like kiddie porn?  Child pornography?  Could you get in trouble for that?  If she's naked. 
[01:29:00]  No, for real.  Of course.  Well, Twitter doesn't allow nudity on there.  Do you know a fucking, this is no bullshit, a family, a husband and wife had their kid  taken away because they took a picture of the kid in a bathtub.  Yeah, we did the story.  We talked about that one.  By the way, we didn't invite you in here yet.  Can you like leave?  Oh my God.  Well, listen, I got everything I needed out of this fucking place.  I don't know how to get on Scrabble.  You only came in here to get your Scrabble ass off the info he needs. 
[01:29:30]  Got to run.  Are you sleeping lately?  Because you're on fire.  No.  When you sleep, you do much better radio for us, you fucker.  Opie's high in Brick Breaker.  I don't remember anymore.  I got to a point and then I fucking took the battery out and fucked my world up and I can't  get back to where I was because my trackball doesn't work properly.  But my Brick Breaker score was through the roof and I was never going to lose because  I had like so many extra guys because I just busted the game. 
[01:30:00]  It got to a point where I was never going to lose.  Somebody says Opie's talking about new car technology.  This coming from the guy whose car heat was a blanket up till recently.  No.  Yeah, that's true.  His poor girl would sit there in the passenger seat with a blanket on freezing.  Hey man, I was warm.  Because the heat only came out of one side.  Opie Benny.  Well, it didn't affect me because my heat was working.  So I didn't know how bad it was.  And then one day I didn't feel like driving because I was tired.  So she drove and I realized how fucking cold it was in that passenger seat. 
[01:30:30]  We had a car two days later.  Such an asshole.  I really am an asshole.  Can we take a break?  Yes.  We talked about the future.  Yes, the future.  We have a really good backstage.  E-Rock's championship belt.  What's this about, Sam?  Can we go to break with this?  Of course you can.  Yeah.  Can we work?  Yeah.  E-Rock came to work.  With his Ted DiBiase million dollar championship belt. 
[01:31:00]  Why?  Because I asked him why.  It's the only thing that fits around his waist now.  Oh.  But I saw him.  He asked both Butcher and Troy to do work for him.  And then the next thing I know while they're doing work for him, I look up.  And he's parading, going to all the girls' desks and showing them his belt.  No, he wasn't.  On his shoulder.  Was he serious?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  He was very prideful in it.  What a dush. 
[01:31:30]  Hey, did you see this?  What a dush.  So, uh, I interviewed all parties involved.  Yeah.  Hey, I gotta go to this phone call.  Sean in Brooklyn.  Sean.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, buddy.  I was asking you about your Brick Breaker, Harvey.  You didn't give a number.  Can you give me a ballpark at least?  I want to see if I'm better than you.  I swear to you, I don't remember anymore.  It was a couple hundred thousand easy.  Hundred thousand?  Are you kidding me?  Yeah, no.  See, this is what happens with Brick Breaker, for the people out there.  Like, you go through the first series of boards relatively easy. 
[01:32:00]  The second series of boards is a lot faster and a lot harder.  But if you get through the second series of boards, it goes back to very easy forever.  Oh, really?  So that's how you bust the game.  So if you get through the second series of boards, now it goes back to the easy stage.  And then you're racking up points and free guys like crazy.  It got to a point I was never going to lose the game.  So you were definitely over a hundred grand.  Oh, way over.  Oh, I had 25,000.  I thought I was...  No, no, way over.  Jesus, dude.  Come on.  Then I had a problem with my BlackBerry, and I wasn't thinking.  And I took the battery out and fucking knocked out my high score. 
[01:32:30]  And I haven't gotten close to getting through that second series of boards again.  One of the reasons is my stupid ball thing is sticking, and it's not smooth.  I've got to replace that.  But I'm done with Brick Breaker anyway.  It just got boring.  Balls are sticking?  What?  My balls are sticking.  That's right.  That's right.  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks, bro.  All right.  And this guy, Danny.  Danny in Pittsburgh.  Hey, L.P., I'm calling bullshit on your story about the new car.  All right.  You didn't get a new car because your wife was freezing her ass off. 
[01:33:00]  You got a new car because you got tired of getting flat tires.  Well, that was part of the problem, too.  Yeah.  I had four flat tires in a two-month period.  The rims were so shot that they were causing just fucking tires to go flat.  You're right.  Didn't your car break down in the parking garage somewhere?  It broke down, honestly, three times.  And I had four to five flat tires in a two-month period.  It was a nightmare.  It was a fucking nightmare. 
[01:33:30]  All right.  We've got to take a break.  We're going backstage with Sam and E-Rock's championship belt here.  Check it out.  And we're going to continue with Rich Voss after the break.  And now, backstage with O&A, here is Primetime Sam Roberts.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts.  O.B. Anthony's favorite little producer, E-Rock, brought in a toy replica million-dollar championship  wrestling belt recently, and it quickly became a distraction.  We spoke to Butcher Ed Brock and Troy Kwan, who were doing E-Rock's work, while E-Rock showed 
[01:34:00]  his shiny toy to some of the girls at work.  Butcher Ed Brock, you're doing a lot of work here.  I don't know if you noticed.  Did you see E-Rock's million-dollar belt?  Oh, yeah.  I'm sitting here cutting up E-Rock shit, doing his work for him while he's walking around  playing with his toys and showing off to girls that don't want anything to do with him.  So you're not impressed by Eric's million-dollar title belt?  No, he could shove every little diamond up his ass.  They're not real diamonds.  Oh, well, whatever.  Fuck him.  Get back to E-Rock's work. 
[01:34:30]  Troy Kwan, did you see E-Rock walking around with his million-dollar championship belt?  Yeah, I did.  He was rather proud, walking around with it, kind of flaunting it, like, hey, look what  I got.  Would you say that he was deserved in doing that?  Well, it's cool he's excited about it.  I think that most of the people on this floor probably don't give a shit.  You've known E-Rock for a long time.  You see the championship belt.  You know him.  Do you think that E-Rock wears the championship belt at home?  Yeah, absolutely.  Maybe he even puts it on and gets on top of his couch and, you know, does like a suplex 
[01:35:00]  with his Teddy Ruxpin doll or something.  More toys, like the belt.  Exactly.  And he probably tries to show his fiancee how cool he is and probably fails miserably at it.  You think so?  Yeah.  Next, we spoke to Nicole from the morning mashup, who was underwhelmed after E-Rock creepily  showed her his wrestling belt.  So, Nicole, you just got to see E-Rock's million-dollar belt in person.  Were you as impressed as he thought you would be? 
[01:35:30]  It sort of looks like it came from Toys R Us.  Is it really a million dollars?  No.  Because it doesn't look like real diamonds or real gold, but he's walking around like  he feels like a million bucks.  So, I guess that's all that really matters, right?  Did it kind of have a vibe of show and tell at SiriusXM?  Yeah, it looks like he got it at a garage sale.  Some five-year-old kid that was playing WWE years ago or something.  So, basically, like, let's say if your boyfriend was walking around and you found out that  he was showing girls his toy wrestling belt, would you be embarrassed to be dating him? 
[01:36:00]  Well, we probably wouldn't be boyfriend and girlfriend anymore.  Let's just put it that way.  Fair enough.  Thank you.  Yes.  Finding it unbelievable that a man in his 30s would behave like this, we reached out to  E-Rock for an explanation.  So, E-Rock, you've been walking around with your million-dollar belt.  In most workplaces, it's not appropriate to bring your toys to work.  Do you think here it's different?  Yeah, here it's a little different.  Butchhead Brock is doing your work in there while you're showing your toy million-dollar 
[01:36:30]  belt to some of the girls here at SiriusXM.  We showed it to one person.  Do you feel like a champion when you wear your toy belt around as if you're a wrestler?  No, Sam, I don't.  What's the wrestling name that you call yourself when you wear the belt at home?  I don't wear the belt at home.  Is it the Pink Flamingo?  No, that's that stupid name you guys gave me three years ago.  Do you find it embarrassing that people think that you brought your toys to show everybody  at work?  Wow, I wonder where they got that idea from, Sam. 
[01:37:00]  Eric, why did you bring your toy belt to work?  Because it's awesome.  I suppose for some, work becomes easier if we bring our toys in.  And while Erock's behavior may be perplexing, watching him can be a valuable lesson.  As it teaches us, somewhere, deep down, there's a retarded child in all of us.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and this has been...  Backstage with ONA.  Hey, I like the Pearl Jam. 
[01:37:30]  It's like Dan and Danny Karaoke. 
[01:38:00]  Fucking guy's still doing it, though, my brother.  Yes, he certainly is.  I saw him on the Target commercials.  He's got a Grateful Dead thing happening, too, man.  What?  Yeah, he fucking does.  Lost a finger.  A finger?  I say finger on purpose now, because people goofed on me many years ago.  Because I said finger.  Hey, another band news, by the way? 
[01:38:30]  Yes.  We meant to do this one before we did our break on the future.  Yes.  U2.  I'm a big U2 fan.  They're going to be streaming Sunday's Rose Bowl concert live on YouTube.  You want to talk about the future?  U2 concert on YouTube.  That's pretty cool.  Is it going to be U2?  Or 2U?  No, it's like U, and then the number 2, and then B-U-B-E.  U-2-B. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, I got you.  Are they going to spell it different?  Is it all fancy?  Is that what they did, like U2?  I think a few people are going to check that out Saturday.  Just a few.  That's a big, perhaps, murder, rape.  Rich Voss in studio playing the Helium Comedy Club, a fine establishment in Philly, over  the weekend, coming up.  And Bonnie's on this one, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Is she outshining you at this point?  It's hard to follow her, because she's doing now like she used to just fucking read her 
[01:39:30]  dumb notes, but now she puts her foot on the table like she's fucking working the crowd.  She owns the joint.  Doing racist stuff.  I taught her how to do fucking be a racist, and now she's fucking out fucking racisting  me.  Thank God for you.  Out-racisting you.  You know, so she's up there, and in the middle spot on a comedy show, Opener usually does  okay or bombs, then the middle spot is the fucking cake spot.  It's guaranteed, because the sacrifice goes up, warms them up, middle goes on and only 
[01:40:00]  has to do 25 or 30 kills.  Then the headliner comes out, and then the checks get passed out as you're on stage, like  towards the end.  Yeah, it drives you guys nuts.  You've got to hold their fucking dumb attention, as you know, especially if there's fucking  Jews there, then they're going, you know, the checks going around the table 12 times.  You know, if there's blacks there, the dollar bills are coming out.  They take stamps here and stuff like that. 
[01:40:30]  So, it's a nightmare when the checks go out.  Not tipping takes a while.  Oh yeah, please.  Timmy, fuck that cracker.  I paid for my drinks.  Just ask me what I want.  They get a paycheck for bringing me that shit.  They run a fucking waitress ragging, too.  They just run four ice cubes.  What the fuck is this?  They run them.  Customer service.  Customer service.  Have you ever done?  Oh, the fucking worst. 
[01:41:00]  So, Bonnie is...  And she should be headlining everywhere.  She just doesn't do it because of the baby and shit.  But she destroys now.  I'm telling you.  You ask any ONA people that have seen her recently, it's just fucking...  She always destroys.  We get a bad rap because we say female comics aren't funny.  We say that, for the most part, in general, they're not.  But Bonnie is one of the ones that is.  She's on a short list of female comics that are very funny.  We always thought that. 
[01:41:30]  I'd put her up against fucking...  Any fucking broad.  Yeah.  Most broad.  Yeah, she's got a Margaret show.  I saw...  What was I watching?  She's still fucking doing it for some reason.  The lesbos love her.  She, like, goes to San Francisco and shit.  And Margaret Cho kills.  With a big frying pan face. 
[01:42:00]  How's that sandwich, Rich?  Jesus.  You're choking?  What the fuck's wrong with you?  Jesus.  I'm in a rest area.  Oh, is that...  What is that supposed to be?  Some type of glamour shot of her?  Some glamour shot.  She does have a great line, Margaret Cho.  Yeah.  She's, uh...  I'll make sure if I haven't heard this.  This is funny.  She's going for an abortion.  Uh-huh.  And the doctor goes,  Oh, so you're a comic, da-da-da-da.  She goes,  Can you just shut up and kill my baby?  That is funny. 
[01:42:30]  That's kind of funny.  Why is she doing that, like, naked?  I don't know.  What is she doing these days?  Oh, she's outrageous.  Is that her...  She's got a dick.  No, that's photoshopped.  Who wouldn't come out with a hug?  She has some money for a tummy tuck and a face tuck.  She's got a big gut.  She never had kids, too, right?  What is she doing these days?  She needs a tummy tuck and never had kids.  She's, like, posing nude and shit?  Yeah, she's a little crazy.  She's tatted up.  She's crazy.  She's got...  She's got...  She's got...  She's got...  She's got...  She's got...  She's got... 
[01:43:00]  She's got...  She's got, like, all kinds of these Asian tats on her.  Asian-looking tats.  That's like a Nicolas Cage movie.  Like, if you...  You could find, like, the hidden funniness in her tattoos.  The hidden funniness.  You bailed out of that one nicely.  All right.  All right.  We got some great stuff still to get to here.  So, we got Rich Voss playing Helium Comedy Club this weekend.  Get your tickets.  It's definitely worth it.  You just better hope the fucking Phillies, you know...  Win.  Win tonight.  You need a... 
[01:43:30]  You need a Phillies win tonight.  Yeah, because...  Where that town is going to be distracted by their baseball team and you're fucked.  They fucking love the Phillies.  The last time I was there, two times ago, Springsteen was in town.  What?  That's big?  He just started going back on tour?  I find any excuse why I can't fill seats.  What are you kidding me?  The last time I was in town, it dropped from 80 degrees to 70.  And people said, we're not going out tonight.  No.  Yeah.  They're not all fucking gems.  If I had my ketchup for the sandwich...  Give me the ball back.  Can you get ketchup for me? 
[01:44:00]  What the fuck am I?  Just pass the ball back.  I got this.  All right.  Let me...  I'll give you a nice bounce pass in a little while.  Just hang in there.  Just hang in there and play a little D for us, okay?  Yeah.  You don't have to be LeBron James on this show.  Just hit a few three-pointers.  We'll win the game.  Hey, Anthony, we got another newsreader fucking up.  One of our favorite things in the whole world to do.  It's quick and easy, so let's get right to it.  Lucy, thank you.  Tonight, New York City's former top cop, Bernard Carrick, ordered to make an unexpected trip to jail, 
[01:44:30]  and his bail was revoked.  What is he thinking about, huh?  Top cock.  What is he thinking about?  Lucy, thank you.  Tonight, New York City's former top cop, Bernard Carrick, ordered to make an unexpected trip to jail,  and his bail was revoked.  Yeah.  How fucked up is that, by the way?  Who wanted him?  Which president?  Was it Bush?  Bush, yeah.  Bush wanted him.  Bush wanted him.  I had a Homeland Security.  After the job he did for New York City, around 9-11 and whatnot. 
[01:45:00]  This guy had a clear path to some fine fucking success.  The guy was there with Rudy, walking down the street with the fucking gal.  Marching, yeah.  The respirator on, walking down to Ground Zero.  New York's top cock.  Top cock, man.  And now in jail, revoked his bail, because apparently...  Yeah, but you're fast-forwarding a little too quickly.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Then Bush noticed the job he did and said, fuck, we need this guy in Washington. 
[01:45:30]  Homeland Security.  And then all of a sudden they started looking into his background and went, ah, fuck.  Realized he had a couple of shady things going on.  And it's gotten worse ever since, to the point now, yeah, he's in jail and he's not coming out.  They revoked his bail, because apparently he's been maybe, allegedly, toying with witnesses and whatnot.  Jesus.  So, dude, that's the fucking guy.  He had it all.  He was the police commissioner of New York City, and now he's in jail?  What did he do? 
[01:46:00]  How bad is that shit?  What did he do?  What did he do?  I think he had a maid that was an illegal alien.  That's all right.  Everybody does.  No, it's all kinds of...  I'm kidding.  It was all kinds of, like, improprieties with, I think, financial things.  It was a financial thing that started the whole ball rolling, I believe.  It's stuff that the police commissioner isn't supposed to do.  No.  Improprieties.  We're going to move into Jacktober, probably, within the hour, but a little teaser, a little 
[01:46:30]  pregame for Jacktober.  We have a radio host that is in a bit of trouble.  Oh, got in a jam.  Diddy?  Yeah, radio host stunned at co-host's arrest.  Oh, boy.  Ready for this one?  Oh, no.  MooCrew on 98.1 The Bull is used to being the talk of the town.  MooCrew.  The MooCrew?  He's a MooCrew host.  The MooCrew.  MooCrew's in the morning with you. 
[01:47:00]  What does the MooCrew mean?  He's part of the MooCrew.  What do they do?  What's going on?  The MooCrew, Eric and Steve.  Oh, Jesus.  That was Travis.  I'm going, Travis.  These guys do their own radio show within a show.  I know.  That's good.  It's the MooCrew.  I see you brought your championship million dollar Ted DiBiase belt.  Down the hall, you had the Shvoo Crew.  Oh, no. 
[01:47:30]  Did you give him the ball back?  No, I didn't.  That was a good line.  I gave you a perfect bounce pass and it went out of bounds.  That was a good fucking line.  Shvoo.  When do you get to use shvoo that much?  Shvoo.  And with Voss in there, it's the Jew Crew.  That's coming in.  Well, let's listen to what happened to a member of the MooCrew.  Yes.  MooCrew on 98.1 The Bull is used to being the talk of the town.  And just like their listeners, MooCrew host Deanne Stevens was stunned when her co-host was hit with child pornography charges. 
[01:48:00]  Oops.  Better country.  98.1 The Bull.  It's Officer Don and Deanne on this Monday.  We got a little lady, Annabellum, headed your way.  She's familiar to thousands of country music fans who tune in to 98.1 The Bull every morning.  Any television viewers remember Deanne Stevens from her reporting days at WKYT and WYMT in Hazard.  Here we go.  Her radio job has delivered some perks.  Here we go.  Meeting everyone from Coach Calipari to some of the biggest stars in Hollywood. 
[01:48:30]  Here we go.  And country music superstars.  But this past week, events involving her former radio partner had Stevens avoiding the public spotlight.  I honestly was overwhelmed by e-mails and voicemails and my Facebook page.  And I would open it and I would start to read them and then I would close it because I just couldn't finish.  You know, the tears.  Ha, ha, ha.  The tears.  Her former radio partner, Dusty Dan, now no longer at the station, was arrested and charged with having child pornography. 
[01:49:00]  The press records state that Roy Baldrige, his real name, had 500 images of child porn and erotica in his home.  What would management say?  500.  Why do you need so many?  These guys, everybody that's got kiddie porn on their computer, it's like 500, 1,000.  What are you going to do?  Jerk off the same three kids?  Who can jerk off that long? 
[01:49:30]  That's what I'm saying.  They like 500.  They can't get enough.  They just load their hard drives up with kiddie porn.  Holy shit, Dusty Dan.  What's wrong with you, Dusty Dan?  Oh, he is a dirty, dirty Dan.  Oh, my God.  Oh, look at what a creep Dusty Dan looks like, too.  It looks like Private Pyle.  What do you mean?  He looks like every other guy on radio.  That's true.  Are you kidding?  Big fucking guy.  Hello, I shaved my head and my mustache. 
[01:50:00]  He looks like the puppeteer from Heroes, the guy that...  Do you watch Heroes?  Oh, no.  Fucking exactly like him.  All right, all right.  Then someone out there is getting it.  All right.  You know, that's what you hope for with this radio show.  Someone out there is laughing.  Oh, man.  Here's the thing I have.  500 images of child porn.  I don't have 500 images of my computer.  Of anything.  What the fuck?  Let me think.  500 kiddie porn.  What do I got? 
[01:50:30]  I can't even tell you.  I might have 500 celebrity photos, maybe.  I got like clip art.  A lot of clip art and little things that I've taken out so I could Photoshop things.  Stuff like that, like fun shit, you know, a fun video of some guy cracking his nuts  as he's trying to skateboard on a rail.  Sure.  I don't know.  The dog skateboarding.  If you look at him, how ugly does a kid have to be before they would fuck him?  Oh, Jesus, Rich.  I think he's just checking out pictures. 
[01:51:00]  Dusty Dan.  We don't know what else he's doing.  In his fantasy.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Why don't you get in the Dusty Dan van?  Got it right here.  Hey.  Wonderful.  A lot of fun.  Hey, kid.  Can you help me get this couch on the van?  Would you?  Would you?  Are you about a size zero?  Are you about a size three teeth?  Are those Oshkosh B'Gosh?  Do you have any little brothers? 
[01:51:30]  I haven't fucked a fetus ever.  It's terrible.  You're Dusty Dan.  Yeah, let's hear the rest of them.  All right.  I think I went from shock to disbelief.  Now, you know.  Angry.  Come on.  Very angry.  Stevens is the mother of two young daughters.  Oh, boy.  Like, I went home that night and just squeezed my babies.  That's what he was doing.  You know?  Squeeze the babies, huh?  Squeeze the babies.  I just went home and squeezed my babies. 
[01:52:00]  She was sitting next to Dusty Dan that whole time.  And Dusty Dan had, like, fucking, his dick was stuck to his underwear after looking at his 500 pictures.  And she's just there talking to him like he's a regular guy.  Regular radio guy.  Oh, Dusty Dan probably came over to her house and was like, hey, the kids.  How are the kids?  Where are the kids?  The first thing, he just, where are the kids?  The odds are, the odds are, he might have had a few images in his head after he left this broads home.  Yeah, it's Dusty Dan. 
[01:52:30]  Dusty Dan.  You go see Dusty Dan.  Dusty Dan just loves my kids.  I'll babysit if you want to go out.  Well, thank you, Dusty Dan.  Maybe that's why she was squeezing her kids.  Yeah.  She realizes, oh, my gosh.  She knows a little more about what Dusty Dan is.  She's squeezing, they look like toothpaste tubes.  Squeezing, they just...  Oh, my God.  Old Dusty Dan might have been...  She squeezed...  They were like little pimples.  They look like space food. 
[01:53:00]  Jesus, what the fuck?  Old Dusty Dan.  Old Dusty Dan.  Wow.  You think Dusty Dan did some painting with that woman?  Kids?  Dusty Dan is dirty.  On a gun count, too?  Well, here.  We got a little more on this.  Steve.  Oh, goody.  Steve lives in the area.  Steve.  Yeah.  Oh, I do have 500 images.  Thank you.  Yes.  Adrian from Hamilton, Ontario.  I have 500 images of Sunset. 
[01:53:30]  Sunset.  So, okay.  I do have 500 images of Sunset.  Steve, what's going on?  Actually, he had called the cops because somebody was breaking in his house.  That's when they found the porn.  What the fuck was it?  What was it?  On his monitor as they came in?  What the fuck?  Don't mind the fucking 10-year-old on my computer monitor.  What happened?  Punch it out.  No.  Why are you punching out?  You're the only fucking connection we have to the story.  What are you?  Oh, he's gone.  Oh, you son of a... 
[01:54:00]  You son of a...  You son of a...  You know?  You know?  You know?  Yeah.  It's thankful to have him home with me.  Radio station management didn't go far for a temporary replacement for Stephen's radio partner.  Officer Don already does traffic reports on radio and for WKYT.  They should change the name of the radio show to the Goo Crew.  Stupid, doesn't it?  Now they're going to do a hack bit.  Listen to this, Ant.  Hack bit alert coming up.  Traffic reports on radio and for WKYT.  Her faith, family, and professional resolve have pushed Stephen's to move forward. 
[01:54:30]  I truly, truly believe that God doesn't give us anything we can't handle.  What?  And we're going to handle it.  I hate that saying.  Go fuck yourself with that saying.  Tell that to someone that's fucking got a brain tumor or something.  I can handle this.  What?  I'm just fucking...  I'm trying to read a frying pan.  How about...  And God wouldn't give me anything I can't handle.  How about God doesn't test us so much?  How about there is no God?  He's a twisted F when he's testing all the time. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, stop with the tests.  The kid in Honduras who hasn't eaten in four years.  Unless I send him the 20 cents every fucking month.  What has God proven by doing that?  Bloated like fucking...  It's Dusty Dan that's going to be taking it in the ass in prison.  He's got to deal with stuff that God's going to, you know, dole out to him.  Enough with the pop quizzes, God.  Yeah, enough.  He wouldn't give us anything we can't handle.  That tsunami was pretty handleable.  Yeah, yeah.  That was a good one.  A quarter...  Yeah.  A fucking million people. 
[01:55:30]  Well, guess what?  A million and one handled it.  Yeah.  They're still finding corpses.  Stop.  But the God doesn't give us anything we can't handle.  God doesn't give us anything we can't handle.  And we're going to handle it the very best way we know how.  How's that?  And make something good out of a not-so-good situation.  Yeah, good.  Officer Don is a temporary replacement for the next six weeks or so.  The radio station is conducting a national search for a permanent on-air partner for Deanne Stevens. 
[01:56:00]  Baldrige, meanwhile, has pled not guilty to the charges he faces.  Oh, is this Dusty Dan's thing?  Oh, it gets worse.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Because just when you think, it's just 500 images of child porn.  According to court papers, many of those images showed the young boys engaged in anal and oral sodomy.  Pictures of a teen boy wearing swim trunks lying on the beach next to him spelled out in seashells where the number's 98.1. 
[01:56:30]  Detectives say it was a picture most likely submitted for a 98.1 The Bull contest several years ago.  What, did they have a fucking teen boy in swim trunks contest?  Dusty Dan thought that one up.  What do we all want to do?  Well, why don't we do a bumper sticker contest or a song contest?  Why don't we have a naked teen boy contest? 
[01:57:00]  What would management say?  Oh, Dusty Dan, you are quite the card.  No, I mean it.  I really need this one.  Dusty Dan.  Wow, that is, uh, that's embarrassing.  It's not even girls.  We got a guy that has the full Dusty Dan story.  Kyle in Michigan.  Kyle?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Okay.  Hey.  Yeah, I've never heard that before.  Of course not. 
[01:57:30]  Um, yeah, apparently the neighbor called the police because, uh, they saw two guys break  in the house when the cops got there.  They searched the house and found some guns that were stolen and, uh, he had no explanation  for it.  So they got a search warrant for the rest of the house and that's when they, uh, seized  the computer.  Oh, they always take your computer now, which is weird.  It's like, uh, uh, on a weapons thing.  Search warrants, I, I always thought, or at least in the oldie days, had to be pretty specific  as to what they could search for and what they could seize. 
[01:58:00]  Now it seems to me a weapons thing, like computers have become a thing, like no matter what your  crime is, they assume there's going to be some record of it on your computer.  So they seize your computer.  But that's, that seems to me to be kind of, uh, uh, uh, an iffy area of, you know, all  right, I have weapons charges here.  Um, why are you taking my fucking computer?  Well, because when he got those weapons on, he could have bought those illegally through  the computer, right?  Exactly.  But any crime, they can seize your computer and then now they can get you for whatever 
[01:58:30]  other thing, you know, uh, I'm not saying, you know, there might not be a, a horse fucking  a woman's mouth on somebody's computer.  Is that illegal?  I don't know.  Well, but it's like before computers, you say if they came in the house, say they were  coming in and looking for heroin or cocaine, right?  Yeah.  And they see a decapitated body, they're not going to walk past this and go, well, that's  not on the list.  No, but you can't tell what's on the computer.  He, I think the example was if they're searching for something that's, I don't know, it's very 
[01:59:00]  specific, the size of a refrigerator, they can't then go through your fucking junk drawer  looking for something that big.  Yeah, but when he's got to be specific, when his wallpaper on his computer is a nursery  orgy, that might've been the problem.  Okay.  I didn't realize that.  When they walk by and they.  Let's go to Brian in Jersey.  They're playing ring around.  Dirty Dan.  Dusty Dan.  Well, he is dirty Dan now.  Sure.  Brian.  I didn't go suck. 
[01:59:30]  Brian, what do you got?  Pick up on the call letters of the radio station.  Huh?  K-Y-T.  Oh, it is?  Yeah.  Oh, it starts with K-Y, huh?  Anyone who works there, man.  K-Y-T.  Dusty Dan playing fuck, fuck, goose.  Kneeling Kentucky.  Don't dodge ball.  Poop shoots and ladders.  Jesus.  Licked it, Dan.  All the call letters are different. 
[02:00:00]  All right.  Let's go to Neil in Kentucky.  Neil.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I'm going to let you know the reporter in that story.  His name is Sam Dick.  Get out of here.  Really?  Yeah, man.  Sam Dick and Barbara Bailey in the morning.  We got a Sam Dick here.  See, get it?  Because he's a dick.  Yeah, I think the story was he reported some guns stolen, and then they did the serial numbers  on the guns and found out that they were stolen before they were stolen from him. 
[02:00:30]  And I guess they got to looking in on some stuff and found some kid porn.  Somebody else saying that a lot of these pictures were hard images.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I don't know if that's true.  But that's what somebody was reporting.  Hard images.  They were hard images for him.  What?  He, like, maybe printed them?  I don't know.  What a creep.  Oh, is he done for?  In the prison?  Did they suspend him?  Let's go to Dan in Cleveland. 
[02:01:00]  Dan?  Oh, is this Dusty Dan?  Hello, Dusty Dan.  Hey, what's happening?  Hey.  Hey, you talked about Dusty Dan having a shot at his kids.  He's a kid, but how long have you been working together?  And I don't think you're over his house much.  Well, and I've been together 14 years.  I've been to Dan's house about six times.  He hasn't seen my place that I moved into two years ago.  I haven't seen it, yeah.  He can't be bothered with that.  I speed out of the city.  He's too busy for his good friend.  No, no. 
[02:01:30]  The thing is, I speed out of the city, and I have no reason to come back into the city.  You know, most of the times when you stop by, it's because you're on Long Island.  Because you're still, you know.  No, it's called going out of your way to see somebody.  Oh.  That's a weird concept for you.  What does that mean?  I understand that.  Going out of your way?  But you kind of go out of your way.  Wait a minute.  Do you mean putting someone else first?  Yeah.  Fuck.  Yeah, exactly.  I've never heard of that.  I'm terrible.  Let's go to Mark.  He's a detective.  Mark, what do you got on this story?  Good morning, James. 
[02:02:00]  And we should segue to Jack Tober.  What the fuck?  Get Sam in here.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Mark.  Okay, but that's what it all boils down to.  You know, they would have to actually make a connection between the computer and those alleged stolen guns.  Not to say that I'm defending this scumbag that did this stuff.  But the bottom line is it would be like, you know, if somebody stole the refrigerator, you can't go through somebody's drawers.  You know, with a search warrant to justify, you know, you'd have to explain that to a judge.  So they might have a little bit of a tough time trying to prove that.  Yeah. 
[02:02:30]  They found a bag.  Anyway, I love you guys' story, and happy birthday to Jimmy when he gets a bag.  All right, man.  Thanks.  All right.  Later, guys.  They said they arrested this guy, Dusty Dan.  They found a bag containing more than 500 images of child pornography.  He probably traveled.  A bag containing 500 images?  Wow.  What the fuck?  He's old school.  It's like thumbing through pictures with his sticky fucking fingers. 
[02:03:00]  He was probably trading, like he used to trade baseball cards.  Oh, God.  Got it, got it, need it, need it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it.  Leaving greasy ball smell on all the photos as he thumbs through them and jerks, and then decides he wants to look at another.  Oh, God.  Oh, Dusty Dan is filthy.  I hate Dusty Dan.  Let's say hi to Larry King.  Larry!  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Hey, get here.  Larry.  Dusty Dan. 
[02:03:30]  Yes.  How important is the pubic hair?  Apparently not very for old Dusty Dan.  Let's say hi to Greg in Jersey.  Greg.  Greg?  Yeah, I'd like to make sure that Magnum P. Lisp sticks to telling jokes and stops trying to figure out what search warrants are for.  Oh, really?  That's what you, you had time to think about that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You went over in your head, this is going to be the one that's going to put me over the top.  This is the funny one.  You couldn't get a better Lisp detective, like, name? 
[02:04:00]  Oh, whoa.  That would have went better with Lisp, maybe?  Yeah.  Magnum P. Lisp?  Yeah, that doesn't.  Magnum P. I, it doesn't.  Yeah, and not only that, that show was on before we had remote controls.  All right?  Fatso.  We just lost a goddamn good call.  Shit.  Some lady saying that her daughter was actually one of the pictures.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Number 78.  Maybe I should call back.  Yeah.  She had more fucking info on this guy.  Jeff in Lexington. 
[02:04:30]  Looks like a lot of people know about this story.  Jeff.  Yeah, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Dusty Dan's a dirty boy, but apparently his co-worker there, Deanne Stevens, who they were interviewing,  not exactly the cleanest person herself.  She's going through a divorce right now because she was fucking her best friend's husband.  All right, that's what you're saying.  I mean, is this somewhere that's reliable?  I don't like when people say things like that because, to tell you the truth, sir, I don't know that.  And you're just spewing, you know, rumor and innuendo. 
[02:05:00]  We can't.  I happen to be very close to the situation.  Well, unless it's verified and confirmed, you're just blurting out stuff that we can't verify.  Yeah, did it make the news?  It has made...  Blogs?  No, no, no, no.  It's certainly getting around.  People are aware of it.  People are aware.  See, this guy, we can't take what you're saying as anything.  Yeah, we've got to be careful of that stuff, Jeff. 
[02:05:30]  Are you insane?  You might be telling the truth, but we've got to just be very careful with that type of thing.  No idea.  We know the rules.  We're going to get into somebody's personal life like that when we have no clue.  Right.  When we have a clue, then we strike it.  Oh, yeah, then we'll...  Oh, then it gets terrible.  That's a big difference.  Thank you, Jeff.  Let me go to Sean in Virginia.  Sean.  Hey, One.  Hey.  I kind of have a feeling maybe the fella had stuff hidden away from his wifey in the  gun safe, and that's probably how they got a hold of all this stuff. 
[02:06:00]  Hmm.  Maybe he was hiding it.  In the gun safe?  Where the guns were.  Yeah, that sounds like a possibility.  I've been known to keep a few shekels hidden away from the wifey in my gun safe.  500 fucking kiddie porn pictures.  Why would you...  If you had 500 kiddie porn pictures, would you ever call the cops to your house?  Ever.  Like, why would you call the cops?  I would throw the hard drive in the Hudson River first.  That's what you do.  The entire computer in the Hudson River, and then, like, we'd talk about, my desk would 
[02:06:30]  be dusty except where the computer used to be.  Where the computer used to be.  And I would just go, I don't know what happened.  Hi, officer.  You got a computer?  Nope.  And I don't even know what they look like.  Nope.  What's that dust spot there?  There's an old TV.  Right, I'm off the grid, sir.  I decided that I don't need any of that shit.  And there's, like, a power cord still in the wall and fucking an Ethernet cable sticking  out of the wall.  A mouse.  There's a cartoon shadow of where I ran through my wall to get outside as fast as possible. 
[02:07:00]  I'm sure this guy wasn't married.  If you look at this guy, he's definitely not married.  He looks like a guy that would be married, though.  You think so?  He's usually the creeps.  Yeah, let's go to Gennaro and Coram.  Gennaro.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  I'm a federal police officer, so I got this whole Fourth Amendment thing down.  Anthony, I hope you're ready to get your education on.  You'll like this.  Thank you, sir.  What happens is when someone is called, when the police are called to investigate something  like a robbery in progress or something, they have no probable cause for an arrest, but 
[02:07:30]  they do have reasonable suspicion to go inside the house and look for people in places that  people can hide.  Now, when they're authorized to go in the house based on that reasonable suspicion, if they  find a weapon or something laying around in plain sight, they then have probable cause,  especially since those weapons were, I believe they said, stolen, they then have probable cause  to go to a judge and obtain a search warrant for the house as well as an arrest warrant.  The arrest warrant is going to enable them to search the immediate area of wherever they 
[02:08:00]  arrest him.  So, I mean, they must have, the computer must have been like right within arm's grasp and  they took that thing with them.  Well, apparently they were hard copies in a bag.  So, it sounds like they didn't even really have to worry about the computer too much.  They probably took the computer anyway to save, right.  After you find the porn pictures, that would probably give them cause to take the computer.  Yeah, but if they came in the house looking for the guns and then they had to go get the  search warrant or arrest warrant, wouldn't they have to leave and then come back? 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, yeah, that's what happened.  They have to go get that warrant.  I mean, they're there because they got that call that there was, you know, people breaking  in the house.  They can go in the house.  So, the fact that they were able to go back with that search warrant meant that those guns  were in plain sight and they were authorized to make that arrest and perform that search.  Dusty Dan's an idiot.  Okay, so...  Yeah, he's probably got to be on the list of top five worst child porn people ever because  you don't just, what do you, just leave them on the kitchen table?  I don't get that.  Say the cops come over to the house for some domestic, whatever. 
[02:09:00]  Jesus, Rich.  No, I'm just asking.  Let's just say a girl named Bonnie gets punched in the face.  And a little tiny handprint is on her cheek.  No, but no, say they come in the house over domestic and they walk in and they see an  ounce of cocaine on the table.  Can't they arrest you for that right there?  Fuck yeah.  Um, it depends.  Why are they in the house?  Over domestic, say over domestic, or just say anything.  Oh, okay.  So they just come in your house and see it.  If they're showing up, you know, to something that's domestic and that's out on the table, 
[02:09:30]  one, you're an idiot, two, you're going to jail.  Yeah.  There you go.  That's an obvious one, Rich.  Well, sometimes you're, whatever.  No, that's an obvious one.  That was pretty obvious.  Well, with the pictures.  No, that was obvious.  Any other brain busters, Eric?  What did you say?  Security cop, mall man?  He's a federal police.  He's a federal police officer.  How are they saying that?  Let's see a badge.  A badge?  Yeah.  Is someone keeping track of all the mispronunciations today? 
[02:10:00]  That list is going to grow.  You're a federal?  And if I could show you my badge through the phone, I would, Rich.  You guys just asked for proof from the fucking last caller.  How do we know he's a real federal?  Yeah, that type of proof, the guy could then maybe email us a link or say something that would get us there.  Well, this fucking guy, he could be watching Law and Order every night or something.  He's some fucking cop or something.  I don't fucking know.  Or I could have been through 16 weeks of training in Glencoe, Georgia, which is the Federal Law Enforcement Training Academy. 
[02:10:30]  And then another two weeks in Bryn Mawr, Washington, D.C. getting my damn police on.  This fucking guy is schooling you.  Can you send me a hat?  And he said, fuck off.  Can you send me a hat?  He's schooling you, bro.  Yeah, Rich, Rich.  Rich, I'll send you a hat with some pudding in it, okay?  I don't get that.  That's a brain cancer joke.  Brain tumor joke.  Oh, thank you, Gennaro.  Thank you.  Ah, fucking quorum.  Right on.  Long Island boy.  I guess we're done with that, right, Ant?  Yeah. 
[02:11:00]  Well, I'm sure we're not done with Dusty Dan.  I want Dusty Dan updates hourly.  Well, this guy has Doug in New York.  I mean, the phone's ridiculous on this one.  Doug, what do you got?  Hey, yeah.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, Rich.  Yeah, I'm a computer forensic expert in New York, and, yeah, a lot of times what they'll  do is they'll find these guys are trading with other people, and they'll either track down  by email or IP addresses, so they're going to have something to go on to get a warrant  to look for, you know, a computer.  So they're going to know that there was a computer associated with an accountant and 
[02:11:30]  owner, trace it down to somebody, and that could be a good way that they got it.  Yeah, but apparently they weren't, like, this guy wasn't part of a sting operation.  They went into the house looking for something else and found these.  But now, if there's more kiddie porn on the guy's computer, now a lot of other guys are  fucked that he could have been possibly trading with.  Oh, right, right, right.  Then they could go through his computer and find out who Dusty Dan was trading with.  You know, in this day and age, I don't understand the guys that are fucking doing this.  Oh, you'd put your credit card number in and join a site and fucking doing that. 
[02:12:00]  You're nuts.  I don't open any emails from anybody.  I don't like, like, unless it's, you know, family, things like that.  Thank you.  But if there's an attachment, that fucking thing gets deleted immediately.  Because I don't know what the fuck people send.  Goodbye.  Dusty Dan from D. Dan.  Well, this segs us right into fucking Jacktober, I'm thinking.  Jacktober!  We should break before nine. 
[02:12:30]  They need to set up the ISDN on your board for Ellis.  Right.  Well, then what?  Then what?  Can we sneak Jacktober in?  And then we'll push everyone back.  Well, that's what we do.  You guys typically take a long time.  We run our show.  Jacktober, right.  All right, maybe we could do a speed round with Jacktober.  Plus, Bill Burr is calling in at 9 o'clock, too.  Well, we'll figure it out.  We'll start with Jacktober.  Maybe we'll do half and half or something.  Yeah, we got Bill Burr checking in.  And we also have Jason Ellis checking in.  Two quick phoners on the way. 
[02:13:00]  There you go.  Jason Ellis is playing the Helium Comedy Club this weekend.  And let's do a little Jacktober.  Yes.  Happy Jacktober, everybody, from your friends at the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I want to rock!  It's a celebration of hacky, pukey radio shows and DJs from across this great nation of ours.  Blocking the berries, sweet as the juice, baby!  There's a lot of energy there for some reason.  But it's like wasted energy.  Yeah.  It's like sitting in your driveway in neutral and just gassing it.  Crank up the crapola, it's Jacktober. 
[02:13:30]  There's a person stranded.  There's a show, there's a show!  It's stranded.  My rebuttal is, yo mama.  I like that.  What the hell was that?  Happy Jacktober, everybody, from your friends at the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Let's all do it.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  There was no joy attached to the num-num.  And with that, we say hi to Sam. 
[02:14:00]  Sam.  Hi.  We got Jocktober going on.  That's right.  Who are we highlighting today?  Today we're headed all the way to Green Bay, Wisconsin.  Wow.  I was just telling Rich you should play Wisconsin.  We got a hotbed of activity up there.  That's right.  We got some O&A fans in the Wisconsin area.  And maybe while he's there, he can stop by Murphy in the Morning on W-I-X-X.  Murphy in the Morning.  That rolls off the tongue nicely.  Murphy in the Morning.  Murphy in the Morning.  That sounds like something I would want to listen to. 
[02:14:30]  It's not just Murphy by himself, of course.  He's got a sidekick.  Oh, what's his name?  I don't know what his name is.  Oh.  Kate Toucher.  I mean, it's Murphy is the guy.  Yeah.  And then, so he's got a sidekick guy.  You can go to his website, W-I-X-X.  Wait, we're not doing the fucking couple thing today?  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  See, because I went, what's his name?  And you're supposed to go, no, no, no, no.  It's a woman.  And I go, really?  No, no, no.  See, it's called sarcasm.  We knock it back and forth. 
[02:15:00]  Well, the thing is, they've got a woman with them.  So it's two guys.  It's two guys.  And a woman.  Yeah.  And while this woman, she banters with both of them, to me, I feel like the relationship  that she has with Murphy is like, for a second, you think, what are these two, married?  Really?  Yeah.  I mean, they're not, I don't think.  Never, you never get that on radio.  Sounds very familiar.  That's very interesting.  Yeah.  Strange.  You think, maybe they are. 
[02:15:30]  Hmm.  Luckily, she contributes a lot.  Does she?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This show is basically, they don't do anything.  They don't do anything.  Now, how does that piss you off, Ant?  These guys that listen to us have no idea what they can be listening to out there.  All right, let's see.  Do they at least play music to fill up the time?  Yes, they play music.  Okay, another show that fills up the time.  This is Murphy.  Murphy is, um.  Murphy is the ball guy. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  That has to wear the baseball cap all the time.  No, he's got the Nike cap and like a sweater vest on.  Oh, does he do the sports breaks?  I mean, yeah.  Is he like a sports guy?  He's a guy.  Guys like sports.  And, uh, who's that guy?  Mayno.  Mayno?  Yeah, well, that's his last name.  That's who he goes by.  Hey, Mayno.  There's a rapper named Mayno.  Oh, okay.  And Katie.  Katie, you know.  Katie, uh, wow.  Katie looks like she, uh, enjoys a little bite to eat.  Yeah.  What is this, Wisconsin?  Yeah.  So they milk her every morning. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, Jesus.  See, at first I didn't know about Katie being on the show, but then I read her bio, and  it said something like, uh, that she manages to keep up with these guys, so lucky for us.  Wow.  That must be rough for her, but good for her, I say.  Yeah.  She keeps up with the guys.  Ugh.  That's what I'm telling you.  Look at that.  Just walking in there, you know.  If, like, I was on the road and I had to walk in and see those three.  Yeah, look at that. 
[02:17:00]  I'd go right now.  Hey, how you doing?  This is going to be horrific.  Uh, Rich Voss.  Voss, hi.  I'm Murphy.  How you doing?  And are we going to be hearing radio voices?  Uh, yeah.  They got some radio voices, but they are also Wisconsin-y voices a little bit.  Oh, okay.  They're like cheeseheads?  Yeah.  But, I mean, I listened to this show for hours, and most of the talk breaks are spent advertising  that there's a Halloween party coming up and, you know, more music around, and nothing's  happening.  Yeah, they're really a Murphy golf outing. 
[02:17:30]  They got, uh, uh, a breakfast thing that was going on.  And there's, um, Murphy, his teacher, Mano, for a day, at St. John's School.  What?  Oh, wow.  Dusty Dan would have liked that gig.  I guess they're making sure they're local, because that's how they compete against satellite  radio.  Once again.  A lot of jocks nowadays.  A Dairy Queen opening?  Mano went to a Dairy Queen opening. 
[02:18:00]  A lot of jocks nowadays don't make a lot of money in their salary, but get paid for appearances.  Look, let me, let me explain something to you and to the people listening.  If, if you pop this show up, and this picture was guys that were in their early 20s, and they  were opening a DQ, I'd be like, all right, you know, you gotta go through that shit.  These guys are no kids.  No.  And they're fucking doing DQ openings, and fucking posing with snowmen at car dealerships. 
[02:18:30]  Holy fuck!  I'm annoyed at their career.  I'm disappointed.  I'm disappointed in them.  Well, I mean, you should hear them and tell me, like, maybe listen to this first little  clip, and then hear, like, if you still think that they're too good to do Dairy Queen openings.  Okay.  Is Tracy Morgan live right now?  On PIX?  I saw him on, I saw him on the Kevin Smith movie set there, when Kevin invited me, which 
[02:19:00]  was a nice gesture, a gesture by Mr. Smith.  And I talked to Tracy, who's in the movie that Kevin was filming at the time, that looks  like it's going to be a really good movie.  And I hung with Tracy probably for an hour and a half easily, and he was cracking up  everybody, and we were bonding, and he was telling, you know, the people on the set,  you know, all this crazy stuff Ant and I have done over the years that he's been involved  with, and blah, blah, blah.  And he's got a book out called, what, Tracy Morgan, what is the title right there?  I am the new black.  I am the new black.  And he goes, I can't wait to go on your show to promote this book. 
[02:19:30]  And we haven't heard from him since.  What's that about?  No, he said he can't wait.  Oh, as in, I can't wait.  He's like, hey, I'd love to do it.  Too busy.  I can't wait to do the show.  But what's that about?  So I'm not going to do it.  Was he bullshitting with me?  Yes, he was.  Is there a problem?  I think so.  How could he be bullshitting with me?  We talked for an hour and a half.  It wasn't like one of these quick little, he's making believe he cares I was there.  Oh, but you don't really get the Hollywood relationship thing.  You get tied up into thinking that they're really like friends when they're just Hollywood people. 
[02:20:00]  You know.  But he was talking about the softball game when he walked out there with just a jockstrap on.  He was talking about the bee thing we did.  Doesn't matter.  Where he ran out of the studio, petrified.  Tracy's publicist says he slammed.  So he doesn't have time for his old buddies, huh?  Yeah, but if he's slammed, he could cancel one thing. 
[02:20:30]  But isn't that the whole point of promoting a project?  To be slammed.  It's to be slammed.  And if he doesn't have a spare minute, then you cancel somebody who maybe you didn't hang out with.  And then you come on our show.  Well, sometimes the publicist doesn't even bring it to him.  He probably didn't.  No, he knows.  Because I had a conversation with the guy.  And I guess he was in the building yesterday.  He knows where we were.  And he was on Howard's show.  We just don't get any respect.  I'm just looking for a tiny bit.  I know in the end we won't get a lot of respect. 
[02:21:00]  I know that.  I don't know what we're going to have.  But I'm looking for a little bit.  If we ever got respect.  Oh, my God.  I just want a little bit.  Maybe you guys should do a Dairy Queen opening.  Yes.  That's what we got to do.  Yes.  If you guys would do a little more for the community.  Well, extremely disappointing that Tracy isn't coming on our show to promote this book.  Especially after the conversation I had with him.  All right.  Let's move on to Jack Tolber.  Now my rants are quick and to the point in.  That's it.  Instead of spending eight hours on it.  Fuck it. 
[02:21:30]  Murphy in the morning on WIXX.  Green Bay, Wisconsin.  Murphy and the gang do a really good break about pizza.  Who doesn't like pizza?  Who can't relate?  You know something?  They did hit a topic that everybody enjoys.  Pizza.  I saw your ears perk up for pizza.  I like pizza.  Who doesn't?  You're right.  Well, let's get into it.  Is that her?  Holy fuck.  She's even fatter than we thought.  Wow.  She's going to give birth to a beach ball suit.  What happened?  Oh, look at her legs.  What is that? 
[02:22:00]  She's a bigger girl.  She has no shape under her leg.  She got like skinny, like fucking.  Wow.  She got like those big fat bubbles above her thighs.  You know how they grow those big pumpkins every year?  Yeah.  If you put little sticky legs on a pumpkin.  Yes.  That's what we're looking at right now.  That's Katie.  Katie.  I already forgot her name.  Katie from Murphy in the morning.  She's not going to do anything significant in this business.  Ever?  No.  Oh, I won't be remembered. 
[02:22:30]  Ever?  No.  Look at her publicity shot.  She's leaning into the side of the frame.  She's going to bite what she said.  Her body isn't in it.  Her body isn't in it.  And her back and everything.  Are you trying to say they're doing that tree thing we talked about?  The tree thing.  Oh.  Remember that one?  Dude, I worked.  Ah.  I can't do this again.  She's so nice.  I know she's nice, but come on.  I worked for a radio station.  I'll try to keep it vague.  I've told the story a bunch of times.  And they wanted publicity shots of everybody. 
[02:23:00]  And they took publicity shots of all of us.  Not saying we're all lookers, but we at least passed the audition where they took regular  shots of us.  Except for the night girl, where they put in giant risky business type sunglasses and  had her peeking out from behind a tree.  You couldn't see any of her face.  She had big sunglasses on and she's peeking out sideways from behind a tree.  And then they had her name underneath the picture. 
[02:23:30]  It's like, what?  You can't see her.  Behind a redwood.  Yeah, it was a giant tree.  So you sort of saw her.  And she's so nice.  A house and going to be a house.  And as I recall, one of the hottest radio voices.  Yeah, she had a really good voice.  Really hot voice.  And guys would call up and just be like, oh my God.  They spanked it to her.  That's fucking mean.  Can you imagine?  Wow.  That's brutal.  They had to sit down and go, what are we going to put her behind?  Well, a bulldozer doesn't make a... 
[02:24:00]  Right.  Is that real, dude?  Yeah, the MySpace voodoo pics that pop up are great.  The top ones, it's that blonde chick.  She's wearing white sunglasses and she's got her cleavage hanging out.  Yeah.  And it's cropped.  So all you see is her pretty good face and a nice set of cans.  Huge tits.  And then you look at the whole picture.  She is the fattest woman I've ever seen.  Oh my God.  Like if I saw her, I would say, you are the fattest woman I've ever seen live.  She looks like she washed up on shore right there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like a whale. 
[02:24:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Have you ever fucked a fat girl like that?  Not that fat, but a fat girl.  Never.  Never had a fatty in my life.  I had one.  Did you?  Yeah.  Was it good?  Yeah.  It's all right.  Was it good?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't even know if I was really.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I try harder.  I don't know if I was even in the pussy.  Maybe I try one one day.  People think it's Carol Miller.  It wasn't Carol Miller.  No, no.  A do-ba-doo.  That's the do-ba-doo-du-ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da. 
[02:25:00]  Who doesn't find her?  Oh, whatever.  The do-ba-ba-da-da-da-da-da.  I have no problems with her anymore.  Jason Greenback.  What's going on?  Good morning, boys.  Hey, Jason.  We're about to do a little jock-tober with this Murphy in the morning, and it sounds like  you're from the area.  What do you got?  I couldn't be happier.  I feel like a little part of Green Bay is being exposed today, and what a better group  of fucking dog shit.  They've been popular up here for fucking years. 
[02:25:30]  It's atrocious.  I was so happy to hear the call letters as well.  And once again, I've got to tell you, we told Sam, it's easy to listen to any radio  show and just pick out when they were having an off day or an off bid, and then you put  that together, and any show could sound like it's horrendous.  But we told Sam, just listen to the show.  You listened to what?  This morning's show or yesterday's show?  I listened to yesterday's show.  And he grabs just pretty much basic stuff to give you a general idea of what they do. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, the stuff I didn't grab is just them advertising their events.  Right.  This would be very easy to do if you just waited it out and just got the time when the show  was just having a horrendous break.  Believe me, I think you're covering your bases even with one day.  Sorry, we're looking at more MySpace voodoo pics.  Should rename it Facebook voodoo pics, where the girl looks really good until you see the 
[02:26:30]  whole package.  Thank you, sir.  All right, here we go.  They talk about pizza?  Yeah, I just can't imagine how this show could be popular, because I can't imagine anybody  having any feeling towards it, because they don't do anything.  More people checking in.  They've been popular for a couple decades now.  It doesn't make sense.  They're like a staple up there.  Like, you couldn't even say it's good or bad.  It's just...  It's just there.  It's just void.  All right, here we go.  Murphy and the gang do a really good break about pizza.  Do you get more delivered pizza, or do you get frozen pizza?  What do you eat more of? 
[02:27:00]  Question.  Actually, I eat a lot of frozen.  Oh.  I'm 95% frozen.  Yeah, you get a good frozen.  As long as the crust is good, I always just add mushrooms and stuff like that myself then.  You know, different cheeses and that.  But getting a pizza delivered...  That's like a special treat.  That's a real...  That's like a special treat.  Yeah.  That really is.  It's like, oh, I got garlic sticks, too.  Little stuff to dip.  Cheese bread.  Oh, man.  It's fantastic.  I know.  I know.  I'm going crazy on it. 
[02:27:30]  That sounds like foreplay for the fad chick.  Holy shit.  What was that?  And they're talking about pizza.  I don't care how much money you make, you can afford someone to knock on your door and  go, here's your fucking pizza.  Oh, that's a special treat.  How is it a special treat?  When I was making no money, the only thing I could afford, guess what?  Was Domino's knocking on my fucking horrible apartment door.  Special treat to get pizza delivered?  I mean, you get breadsticks and something to dip them in. 
[02:28:00]  Garlic butter saw?  Could be.  Happy birthday.  Wow.  So that's sort of something.  And then the listeners, maybe I guess they're driving and say, these guys like pizza.  I like pizza.  What a show.  E-Rock just put them on there as a preset.  Yeah.  Because they're talking about pizza.  They've made a fan.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's the type of thing they do.  God.  Is that amazing? 
[02:28:30]  Rich, you're speechless.  Because, like, I know I would go in there, and they would have me out within one break,  probably.  Yeah, that's...  You're too mean.  All right.  That's why you can't even...  That's why the East Coast...  Well, the gang gets local by talking about the lack of rest stops between Milwaukee and Green  Bay.  I hate the fact that, yeah, yeah.  You know, we've done the local thing.  I have rest stops.  Like, remember the show we were listening to, they were leaf peeping, and they just kept 
[02:29:00]  mentioning local thing after local thing?  Well, because, and, you know, I know we're saying the same thing over and over again,  but we're in the fight for our lives here.  Sirius XM, you know, the satellite radio thing, these shows are being told the only way to  go up against satellite radio is to be local, because we can't be local.  The Opie and Anthony show cannot be local.  So they tell all their dumb shows, just make sure you're talking about the sports teams,  the rest stops, the leaf peeping, the local pizza delivery guy, you know. 
[02:29:30]  Well, then I think this is exactly why Murphy in the Morning is so popular.  If people care as much about local stuff as these program directors say they do, this  clip is why Murphy has made such a career for himself.  But you've still got to be good.  Oh.  That's what these program directors don't understand.  Oh.  If you're a good radio show host, it doesn't matter if you're local or just a national show.  They were concentrating on the local thing.  Well, it's dumb.  Oh, I'm sorry. 
[02:30:00]  He just did this show yesterday.  Maury, you know.  Maury just did this show yesterday.  That little kid has tits.  The little kid had a bra.  Maury once again.  Maury's.  The fat babies that keep eating and eating.  And Maury gets them in various states of undress and then makes them eat.  Backstage until they're ready to go on the set.  And it's all under the guise of helping.  We're helping.  But he did this show yesterday.  Yeah.  And these fucking parents.  These enabling parents. 
[02:30:30]  There's fucking child abuse.  Yeah, because the kid.  Yeah, why isn't that child abuse?  It's fucking, you wouldn't feed that kid alcohol or drugs.  Look at what they're doing to him.  He's going to explode that little fucking sumo.  The kid can't get his own food.  So you're giving him all this shitty food.  All these fucking lazy.  Look, average three-year-old weighs 34 pounds.  This mama's baby weighs 120 pounds.  Wow.  120 pounds at three years old.  Jesus.  You think that little kid's in those 500 pictures?  No way.  Yeah, where's Dusty Dan?  I'm sure he likes the fatties. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, whoopie.  Oh, God damn.  And, of course, they have to show him eating a fuckload of food.  Yeah.  No kid can eat that much.  Look, cookies.  He's giving him, like, chocolate chip cookies and everything.  And he's eating a whole sleeve of cookies.  He's a little monster.  Look at the fucking mom.  Look at the fat fucking mom.  Yeah, the mom's a big fatty.  Fat, white trash.  What garbage?  Look at that fucking kid.  He can't.  Oh, my God.  It's in the tub.  Oh, my God. 
[02:31:30]  I'm putting him back in the fucking...  She swung him up and used, like, fucking momentum to get him into his crib.  Look at the tub.  It had one cup of water and it overflowed.  The three-year-old is already in a wheelchair because mommy keeps...  And mommy keeps fucking feeding him.  Oh, go to jail.  Put that bitch in jail.  Hey, we got a Jocktober update, Ant.  Maybe Sam and his staff could get this.  Rusty Fender?  Did we highlight...  No.  When did we highlight Rusty Fender?  He was one of the traffic guys that we...  Ah, well, why wouldn't Rusty Fender be a traffic guy?  Early on, one of the shows had traffic with Rusty Fender. 
[02:32:00]  Okay, well, there's an update on Rusty Fender from WKRZ.  Kitty porn?  No, Rusty Fender has new false teeth and hasn't mastered speaking while wearing them.  That's coming in from Skunk Boy PA.  Oh, I'd love to hear some Rusty Fender.  A Jocktober update from Rusty Fender.  When people are talking over their dentures.  Dentures.  All right, we're distracted by Maury, but we really got to do this Jocktober because  we've got guests piling up after the break. 
[02:32:30]  Bill Burr's calling back and Jason Ellis.  Okay, that's fine.  Good.  Here we go.  The gang gets local by talking about the lack of rest stops between Milwaukee and Green Bay.  We need local references.  I'm surprised there aren't more things in that whole stretch from Milwaukee to hear.  That's horrible.  Like, you better be silvered gas.  You better...  Yep.  There's not a rest stop, right?  There's nothing.  No.  There's that rest stop in between Green Bay and Manitowoc.  Right.  But that's about it.  That's it.  Yep. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  But from Manitowoc to Milwaukee.  Once you hit Manitowoc, until you hit, like, Port Washington.  Yeah.  And I always think that in Sheboygan, that there'll be someplace real close in Sheboygan.  Like a new name.  That is...  See, thank God I don't know anything about Wisconsin.  I don't want to talk about Manitowoc.  Yes.  Did you hear...  You know, Sheboygan, there should be something in Manitowoc.  No, Manitowoc.  Manitowoc.  Manitowoc.  Manitowoc.  You have to say twat and cock at the same time.  Manitowoc. 
[02:33:30]  Manitowoc.  Sheboygan.  What is it?  Trannies in that rest area?  And the glory holes are much too small.  All right.  You can't get a nice, big, fat cock through them.  I can't get my big cheesehead hog through the glory hole.  Boygan.  Sheboygan.  Yes.  Sheboygan.  That's like fucking the start of the Laverne and Shirley show.  Sheboygan.  Manitowoc.  Manitowoc.  Washington.  Yeah.  And I always think that in Sheboygan, that there'll be someplace real close in Sheboygan. 
[02:34:00]  But there really isn't.  At least not that I know.  That's when you hit Sheboygan Falls.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And go into town, kind of.  Yep.  Yeah.  I don't know why.  I don't know why.  Doesn't it seem like it'd be like the most popular place in the world would be to have a truck stop right along the highway there?  Mm-hmm.  Maybe I'll open one.  Maybe.  Hey.  Hey.  Yes.  Hey.  Here we go.  Since it can't be a trucker.  Here we go.  I'll run a truck stop.  Mm-hmm.  I like it.  And your head waitress will call her Ma.  Call her Ma.  Mm-hmm.  Yes.  I like that.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  And have a couple hotties, though, too.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  But you've got to have your Ma. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  That was a complete waste of time.  That total.  Isn't real.  That was a complete waste of time.  Sam is taking people into the studio, production studio, and creating horrid radio.  No, I will have to correct you.  This is actually drive-time radio, morning drive radio, prime time, right about 7.30 in  the morning, right when everybody's driving to work in Green Bay, Wisconsin on a very popular  show.  Can you hear it in Manitowoc or Sheboygan? 
[02:35:00]  Sheboygan.  You know, there's no truck stops between those two, and you would think there would  be.  That's a shame, Fred.  Because where do you have to use the restroom?  You are fucked.  Whoa!  Hey!  Let's go to Brad.  Brad.  Hey, good morning, guys.  First time caller.  I love you guys.  You guys are awesome.  Thank you, Brad.  I'm sorry we don't talk local for you out there.  Well, that's okay.  I can give you guys...  I mean, if you guys go and you Google Sheboygan lately, I mean, there's so much stuff going  on in Sheboygan. 
[02:35:30]  Who would want to stop there?  Yeah, Sheboygan.  Lately in the news, they had the mayor.  He got caught for talking in the bar about his sister-in-law.  Oh, that was Sheboygan?  You remember that story?  Yeah, that story's great.  The guy's drunk in a bar, and he starts talking about how he wanted to fuck his sister-in-law.  Yeah.  And then he gets on and he's like, I apologize for...  It was supposed to be a personal thing.  How did they get audio of him?  Because somebody had a phone at the bar and was, like, taping him.  Nice.  And he's like, yeah, sister-in-law, yeah, I like to stick it in her. 
[02:36:00]  He said something like that, yeah.  It's great.  Yeah, there's so much stuff that goes on in Sheboygan.  I mean, there is one truck stop, but God, who'd want to stop there?  You might never leave.  You might not get out.  Yeah, who gives a shit if there's not enough rest areas?  You figure it out if you're on the road.  Yeah, you turn it off.  You've got a full tank of gas, and you've got a fucking bottle you're peeing if you have to.  Well, the stretch of the road is, like, an hour long.  An hour long trip.  So, I mean...  Yeah, that's all right.  Just about an hour and a half stretch.  But, I mean, you can go up 41. 
[02:36:30]  There isn't much up Highway 41, but there is a rest area on Highway 41 where you won't have to worry about becoming part of the local news up here.  All right.  Thank you, Brad.  I appreciate the knowledge on Sheboygan.  Highway 41, Wisconsin.  All right.  We're going to continue.  The Battle of the Sexes?  The Battle of the Sexes bit?  They do a lot of...  They don't do a lot of bits, but the bits they do are quite original, quite unique, and special to the Murphy in the Morning show. 
[02:37:00]  What they like to do towards the end of the morning is what they call the Battle of the Sexes.  Which, by the way, is the...  I would put it right up there, the oldest morning show bit.  In existence is the Battle of the Sexes bit.  This may be...  That and the cue of the day.  And you get it off of a show prep service.  Yeah.  It's maybe a new spin on it, though.  No way.  They'll have a man and a woman on the phone.  They'll ask the man questions the woman would typically know. 
[02:37:30]  Oh.  And a woman questions that a man would typically know.  Oh, that's crazy.  We've been brought into the studio, Bonnie and I, if we had to do...  We had to do Battle of the Sexes.  But at least you would make it funny somehow, because you guys are comedians.  Yeah, but it was horrible.  Like, when they take me out of the room, I wanted to just keep going to the street.  Scorch had a unique take on Battle of the Sexes.  He called it something different.  Scorch's was chesticles versus testicles. 
[02:38:00]  He called them chesticles.  Yeah, yeah, chest...  You know, the woman's chesticles.  In the morning, you would tease.  Chesticles!  I hope you didn't trademark that, because I don't want to be sued by Scorch for using  the term chesticles.  Totally new.  Chesticles versus testicles.  Coming up on the show today, chesticles versus testicles.  That's Scorch.  I can't believe you left his show to join ours.  You're crazy.  Scorch doesn't learn a lot from that man.  Scorch's other bit was...  It was reverse trivia, where listeners would have to call up with their... 
[02:38:30]  Because he didn't feel like prepping anything.  Listeners would have to call up and ask him trivia questions.  And, of course, since he recorded everything, if they stumped him, he just wouldn't play  the call.  Oh, really?  Of course not.  So he sounded like a genius.  And Trucker Matt just wants it known to everybody that there are 11 truck stops between Milwaukee  and Green Bay.  So, making that break by the Murphy and the Morning Crew even more useless. 
[02:39:00]  All right, here we go.  Battle of the Sexes.  A staple of morning radio for many, many years.  It's the battle of the sexes.  It's the battle of the sexes.  It's the battle of the sexes.  Men versus women in battle this morning.  It is 8.33 at WISX.  This just in, uh, Hoo Hoo has announced that he invented Battle of the Sexes.  Oh, true.  Do you think they made that song themselves? 
[02:39:30]  I would say...  Let me think about it.  No way.  No.  No.  No, no.  Oh, really?  You know for sure?  I mean, I've heard very similar songs on morning prep show service.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I do not think that that is a...  I think John Williams made that.  I think, didn't he?  Really?  I would think so.  You know who I think was the first radio host to do battle of the sexes?  The newlywed game.  Were they on radio or something?  It is 8.33 at WISX. 
[02:40:00]  That sound you heard singing...  It's a delicate flower.  It's a delicate flower.  It's the voice of an angel.  Need I go on?  It's time for battle of the sexes.  We got Shannon standing by.  Hello, Shannon.  Hello.  How are you?  I'm great.  All right.  We're still trying to find a guy to go up against Shannon this morning.  All right, sex.  Good morning.  Hey, Merck.  This is Drew.  Hey, Drew.  How are you doing?  Good.  Good.  Where are you calling from today?  Heading into work from Appleton.  Heading into work from Appleton.  All right, Drew. 
[02:40:30]  You'll be working with Team Katie today.  And, of course, Shannon will be with Mr. Mono.  All right.  I got the good team.  Yeah.  Wow.  All right.  Here we go.  Let's let Shannon go first, though, Mr. Mono.  Okay?  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  I stopped the clip there because I thought it would build anticipation.  I appreciate it.  You know something?  You're absolutely right.  It is.  Okay.  I can't wait.  More info on that truck stop that we were talking about.  That truck stop is where Steve Buscemi gets pancakes and hookers in Fargo.  Oh.  Yeah.  A little knowledge for everybody. 
[02:41:00]  What?  No way.  Really?  I don't know.  I don't know.  There's a comedy club in Apple, Wisconsin.  Appleton?  Appleton.  Appleton.  Yeah.  Appleton.  All right.  The excitement begins with the first question of the Battle of the Sexes.  That's right.  Murphy in the Morning.  Green Bay, Wisconsin.  Shannon.  Yeah.  Which is not a maker of ATVs?  Polaris, Bombardier, or Rascal? 
[02:41:30]  ATVs.  Yeah.  All-terrain vehicles.  Uh, vehicles.  That's correct.  I must be abroad, because I really don't know the answer.  Well, you're a man.  You don't drive all-terrain vehicles?  I really don't know the answer.  You can really know.  I would go with Rascal, I guess.  Yeah, you're correct.  The Rascal is the little rascal that old people go around on.  To the Grand Canyon.  What?  That's the commercial.  Yes, I saw the commercial.  You could even go to the Grand Canyon.  Oh, yeah.  So your grandchild can push you off and collect the money.  Hopefully the brakes fail. 
[02:42:00]  Go a little further, Grandpa.  Polaris?  Bombardier, or Rascal?  Oh, my God.  Um.  How?  Polaris?  Polaris.  Mm.  No.  Sorry.  Oh.  Drew?  Rascal, or whatever that one was.  Rascal.  It's from your car.  There you go, Drew.  So first point awarded.  Yeah, that's exciting stuff. 
[02:42:30]  Drew.  Oh.  Drew from Appleton going to work.  Wow.  So far, it's men up, 1-0.  And as a man listening to this, I'm hoping Drew wins.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I didn't forget, by the way.  Why?  Question for everybody in the room except for Sam.  What show did we feature yesterday on Junktober?  Shit.  And what do they talk about?  And I want you to be completely honest, Anthony.  You specifically said to remember.  And I told everyone that I would ask this question today.  I'm not looking down.  Don't look down.  Because I don't want to see the chat. 
[02:43:00]  I swear to you.  And I'm going to play along, too.  I couldn't even name the city.  For the life of me, I can't even come close.  Hold on.  Danny, let me think if I could even remember the city.  All right.  Let me try city first.  Oh, damn it.  And this would be, it's better radio that we don't know, but I'm seriously going to try  to remember.  Hold it.  City.  City.  I'm really trying to think.  Junktober yesterday.  Yesterday, Junktober.  This is how much we give a shit about other radio guys in the end. 
[02:43:30]  It was a biggie.  It was, shh.  All right.  Don't, don't, don't.  Because I'm.  Tampa.  Incorrect.  No, that was two or three days ago.  Fuck.  I'm looking at a map of the fucking country right now.  That's what I'm doing.  I'm like going around.  I'm trying to.  Was it?  No.  Oh, fucking.  Come on, guys.  You can do it.  Holy shit, dude.  I told you I would ask this question, too.  You want me to tell you what city?  I think I know it.  You want me to tell you sort of the geographical region? 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Northeast.  It was the West Coast.  Oh, right.  All right.  West Coast.  West Coast.  San Jose.  There you go.  San Jose.  Okay.  San Jose.  Good.  All right.  We did an hour on this yesterday.  San Jose.  One of the best ones.  Was it the names?  Was it Katie?  No.  Is that today?  That's today.  San Jose.  That's two minutes ago.  Yeah.  All right.  What's showing San Jose?  I can remember one of the names if you guys want that. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, no, no, no.  I can't.  Because we're the ones that really are supposed to know.  San Jose.  I know it was a couple that you're not sure if they're married or not.  Really?  Were they actually married?  No, I think they were.  No, that was the day before, too, right?  Yeah, these ones weren't, but it seemed like they were the way they talked.  Oh, my God.  We saw their picture?  No.  I don't even remember that.  They had a mustache, and DeRosa said he looked like the human puppet on the movie.  Oh, right, right, right.  Oh, and he's wrapped in the mic cord.  Oh, okay, okay. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, there you go.  And she was holding a back.  What was her name?  Completely.  It was a good name.  It was a good female name.  Oh, oh, oh, because was it Marla?  You got it!  And who was the guy?  You're almost there, Ant.  John?  No.  Jill?  Bill and Marla!  Bill and Marla.  Wow.  Good, good.  Bill and Marla from San Jose.  Yes.  Name one bit we made fun of.  Yes, they did.  They had talking points.  Name one fucking bit. 
[02:45:30]  I remember their teaser.  Oh, they were the show that just teased everything, but never really did anything.  Well, the end of the show teaser was, what do you do if your boyfriend is allergic to  your dog?  Yes.  Okay, I remember that now.  Which they're probably doing right the fuck now.  That's true.  We're going to break right now.  Yeah, well, they would have had to start the show.  But what did they actually do that we talked about?  Marla.  Come on, you can get this one.  I remember.  Dude, I swear to fucking God, I don't know. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, break on pizza.  Marla.  No, that was today.  Yeah, that was also today.  Damn it.  Bill and Marla.  Ten minutes.  Yeah.  Marla.  That's like days ago already.  No, just ten minutes.  Halloween.  Yeah, yeah, you're getting there.  I did a whole Halloween show.  Well, yeah.  Pets.  Yes.  Dressing up your pets.  Dressing up your pets.  And remember he said, what can we dress up a snake as?  Nothing.  Right.  And you said a cock.  I said a cock.  Yes.  Right, which is my answer to everything.  Yes.  A cock.  Wow.  All right.  So you guys remember very well. 
[02:46:30]  We passed.  Holy shit.  You know how much time that just took?  Yeah, you guys.  Much too much.  There was a lot of thinking right there.  You would have needed a cheat sheet.  We rocked.  The game continues with the next couple of questions.  It ends without a joke, but at least we get a laugh.  Yes.  Why need it?  If you're going to laugh, why do you need a joke?  Yeah, as long as you laugh, people think that there was a joke in there somewhere.  Yeah.  All right, Drew.  What is Polly Pockets?  My daughter's sick.  Go ahead.  All right.  A financial guru?  A toy or a clothing company? 
[02:47:00]  A toy.  That's correct.  Do nothing.  All right, Drew.  Jumps out too quick.  Come on, Shannon.  Here we go, Shannon.  Oh, that was simple.  Yeah.  Okay.  Shannon, if you're in a privy, where are you?  I wasn't listening for the last 30 seconds.  Come on.  No, I'm not even kidding.  What just happened?  Well, they were continuing with the battle of the sexes, and Drew was asked, what is  a Polly Pocket?  And he correctly answered, a toy, leaving a two-nothing score in favor of us dudes. 
[02:47:30]  Polly Pocket.  Do you know what a Polly Pocket is?  Yeah, what a bird carries your shit in.  Oh, my God.  It might be.  A cracker would have been better.  Well.  Because Polly want a cracker?  Yeah, well.  Why would you just...  Oh, you mean shit like his stuff?  Yeah.  Oh, I see, but we all thought shit like bird shit.  No, no.  It's just his stuff.  Like a philosophy bag for a parrot.  No.  No.  Polly Pocket keeps his shit in. 
[02:48:00]  Oh.  Oh.  All right.  So it's still good.  It was kind of good.  Well, now that I've explained it to the teacher, the grave goes up.  Oh, really?  All right.  Let me know when I see one.  I'm teasing, of course.  Rich Fox is brilliant.  If you would have got that answer just now, you would have had pizza, and that's a treat.  As long as it's ordered.  Delivery.  You know, delivery.  It's only a treat if you get it delivered.  I like making my own pizza and putting stuff on it, like a hamburger.  Yeah, yeah.  Like these kids.  The cakes.  Yeah. 
[02:48:30]  When you're giant and fat and in radio.  Oh, God.  Let's continue with Battle of the Sexes.  Yeah.  Okay.  Shannon, if you're in a privy, where are you?  An outhouse, the woods, or the bowling alley?  Uh, God.  The hybrid.  Um, privy?  Privy.  Yeah.  What are my choices again?  Outhouse.  An outhouse, the woods, or a bowling alley?  I don't know, an outhouse.  An outhouse. 
[02:49:00]  Very good.  Very good.  Why is that funny?  Someone explain why that's funny.  Very good.  Everyone laugh now.  Maybe because that's where you go bathroom.  An outhouse.  An outhouse is where you go bathroom.  That's funny.  Everyone knows what a privy is.  Right.  So you don't think this is the type of thing that people, like, they're driving to work  and they're like, oh, I just heard the funniest thing on the radio.  This is the, it's who gives a shit radio.  You could just leave it on in the background.  No one's going to be bothered by it.  That's the problem.  It's very popular.  The problem is there's not enough rest areas to pull over and blow your brains out. 
[02:49:30]  They're laughing at the word privy and outhouse.  They did that pizza thing earlier.  Yeah.  So they could say, what do we do on the show today?  Well, we mentioned that pizza is a treat.  Thank God we only got one more clip today.  Oh.  I mean, I could listen to this all day.  Yeah, but the exciting climax of the game comes with a winner announced.  All right, Drew.  What do you call the long back section of a dress that trails along the floor? 
[02:50:00]  Is it called the train, the tremor, or the transit?  For you, a napkin.  That's correct.  A train, yes.  That's right.  A three to one.  All right.  Shannon, who founded the X-Men?  Scott Summers, Charles Xavier, or John Exhibit?  I have no idea.  How about the last one?  John Exhibit?  No.  You're a luster.  Charles Xavier?  Charles Xavier.  Yes.  Nice. 
[02:50:30]  You know, if you're...  Oh, God, this just infuriates me.  You are going to do a bit called Battle of the Sexes.  You actually come up with questions where the majority of guys out there go,  Oh, that's fucking easy.  Yeah.  Some of these questions, I don't know the X-Men question.  And I guessed on the Rascal thing with the ATV thing.  You've got to be an X-Men fan for that one.  Right, that's very specific to that genre of people that enjoy the comic superhero thing, right?  Dudes like comic books in all-terrain vehicles.  No, but if you do the bit, it's obvious shit that almost every guy would know. 
[02:51:00]  Charles Xavier is Professor X.  Right.  I don't know that.  Do you care?  No.  Oh, that's so weird.  She didn't seem to care either.  It was the most lackluster performance by a contestant on a radio contest.  She's just like, I don't know the last one.  She was like disgusted with the whole thing.  I don't know the last one.  Just see.  See.  Hang up the phone.  Xavier.  Yes.  Nice.  Boy, I pretty much am stinking it up.  I don't know, Shannon. 
[02:51:30]  I don't know that far, Shannon.  Well, Shannon, you know what?  You just got a guy that knows a lot about women's stuff.  Yeah, I guess.  We're always harder on ourselves, aren't we?  Yes.  I'm a coach of Mary, 7 and 5.  Oh.  All right, Joe.  All right.  Well, you know what?  This is over.  It's over.  We're calling it.  Shannon's waving the white flag.  That's how they're retiring.  But you sound good, Shannon.  Yeah.  The bid is over.  Laughing and happy.  That's what counts.  What did they win?  Laughing and happy.  That's what counts.  Who cares?  Probably a bumper sticker.  How come you guys don't, like, you have to just call in and say, why are you guys so bad? 
[02:52:00]  Just call up and say, listen, we'll listen up so much.  We usually don't take our calls.  Yeah, Rich.  Yeah.  Don't just say, this is Danny.  Or maybe we could call up and play Ballad of the Sexes and win something.  Really?  I'd rather go home early.  That'd be good.  You don't want to go home early.  Of course we don't.  What's wrong?  You always don't.  You're in a bad mood now.  Because I know I had to spend 10 years fucking in shit markets waiting to, you know. 
[02:52:30]  In the trenches.  Yeah, to get a career going.  As these shows sit in their spot forever doing nothing.  That's why I'm mad, Sam.  Oh.  I should have been a big radio star way before I became one.  Taking up morning fucking radio in Sheboygan where a new show could be.  Right.  Maybe trying to do something that people care about.  Cutting their teeth.  If you guys were in Green Bay, do you think you could go head-to-head with Murphy in the Morning?  You know what?  Probably not. 
[02:53:00]  Probably not.  That just goes to show you the state of radio.  You guys would get so pissed off because the rating books would come back and Murphy would be annoyed as shit.  Oh, yeah.  Well, we're going to go to a car lot.  You know what?  What's going on?  You know what?  You guys make a pretty good point, though.  I mean, when we were syndicated, we did well in general.  But there were shows like this Murphy in the Morning that were doing nothing that were beating us.  Yeah.  And they replaced you.  Which drove you nuts because you knew your show was way better than them.  It would fucking drive us crazy because, you know, you'd look at the ratings every three months and just go, what the fuck? 
[02:53:30]  What do we have to do to beat these people?  Right.  There were shows that, you know, you knew it was going to be a battle.  You knew they were, I mean, as much as you didn't want to admit it, you knew they were doing, you know, some good radio.  And those battles you took on and hoped for the best.  But there were other battles where we knew damn well in our fucking souls that we were way better on our worst day.  And you were losing because they were, their shows were so harmless and milquetoast that they were put on in the stores and in the office and things like that. 
[02:54:00]  And that's the only reason they were being played.  And then, and they also were an institution, you know, which makes it hard to.  Well, they've just been here forever.  I've been listening to them for years.  We're not trying to make excuses.  I mean, this is.  I was.  Yeah, because we knew there were other shows that, you know, it was, it was, it was a tough battle.  Yeah, that was real.  These were the easy battles we should have won, but radio is a fucked up thing.  People are stupid.  When you're in Sheboygan walking through the supermarket, you don't want to hear Hot Con and Norton who shit on your stomach today. 
[02:54:30]  Speak for yourself.  Do you guys think you're better than Loper and Schmitty?  Dude, that's one.  They replaced us for that dumb show.  That, by the way, I keep track of all the shows that we, that replaced us, and not one of them is doing anything important.  Not, not a one.  You're including Lope Wisers?  Cracking open Lope Wisers?  Yeah.  That was a complete disaster for West Palm Beach.  But don't you think they replaced you in most places because they got somebody a lot cheaper? 
[02:55:00]  That's all.  Yeah.  And they wanted, and they wanted more control of their, their shows.  You know, if you have a PD that has syndicated shows, then why do they need the PD?  So the PD would force the local angle as much as possible, and, you know, and, unfortunately, upper management would listen to that shit.  It's in every fucking form of entertainment.  I look at clubs I'm not working, they got some guy in there that I do circles around, but he's probably working for a third of the fucking money.  Right.  And it's the quick fix, and it only fucking gets them at the end. 
[02:55:30]  The quick fix always fucking kills any business.  Holla.  Rich Voss, ladies and gentlemen.  All right, why don't we take a break, because Bill Burr's going to get on a plane in minutes?  Yeah.  He's calling in a few minutes?  Yeah, we gotta get to Bill Burr.  Oh, fuck.  Goddamn.  All right.  Our clock is all fucked up today.  Should we call him?  We can try.  Bill Burr wants to do a quick phone-er, because he's promoting a gig before he gets on a plane.  Where's he going to be? 
[02:56:00]  DC?  DC Improv.  DC Improv, Bill Burr.  That's nice.  You could go down the turnpike.  You see Rich, and then you go see Bill Burr.  Yeah, and there's a lot of rest areas on those turnpikes.  Yeah, it sure is.  Right, Rich?  No shortage there.  Jersey, Delaware, two in Baltimore.  You know where they all are.  What, do you got a rest area app on your fucking new iPhone?  Bill Burr at DC Improv.  This weekend, starting tomorrow night, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. 
[02:56:30]  Tickets available at DCImprov.com.  Look, we just promoted it.  All right.  Yeah, Steve from Bayshore, he goes, but oh, 92.3 now is kicking ass.  Oh, wait a minute.  No, it isn't.  Fuck CBS.  Yeah, in that situation, they never even got a morning show to replace us.  No.  Yeah, but they're killing it in evenings with Chunky.  No, they're not.  Chunky.  I live in this city.  I haven't heard a buzz on Chunky or anybody over there.  Play fucking music now?  They're a jukebox.  They got Lisa Page middays, and then they got the freak show in the afternoons. 
[02:57:00]  Oh, that must be wild.  It's crazy.  Is the freak show crazy?  You don't know what he's going to do, right?  It's batshit insane.  As the lawyers tell him to do nothing.  It's batshit insane.  The lawyers tell him to do absolutely nothing, but he still calls himself the freak show.  Oh, you got to click on Buster's bio.  Click Buster.  Buster.  You got to.  He.  Doesn't click.  He pirated the station.  You see, Buster.  What?  He does it overnights.  He's a young guy who pirated his way into the station, and they let him stay. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, really?  Yes.  He's crazy.  Oh, really?  Oh, my God.  Yes, he tapped into the frequency.  Oh, he did?  So he could do it because he wanted to do his own show.  Is there anybody out there believing that horse shit?  He's got a Yankees hat on.  That's how you know he's from New York.  That's how it's sideways.  When his show started, did it start where you're listening to the station going, what's  going on?  You probably heard static.  Like old analog fucking sounds.  And then he made believe he was, what, broadcasting from a basement or something?  Yeah, and then they gave him a job, and thank God all the staff loves him, and they all 
[02:58:00]  get along great.  Really?  A white pilot?  He's not Somalian.  What's his bio?  He probably worked at a million fucking other radio stations before he, quote, started  pirating his way into the New York City frequency.  Oh, oh, on the phones.  Well, as soon as they put him on hold, I don't know why there needs to be more conversation.  You don't have to type in, like, anything.  Just put him on hold.  It doesn't matter.  Just put him on hold, and we'll pick him up.  It's easy.  See, what you don't see at home, like, we know someone's on the hotline, but we can't 
[02:58:30]  get to them because they need to put him on hold in the other room, but for some reason  they still need to do some chit-chatting.  Yeah, what are they, chit-chatting?  Danny, what's up?  Bill is having, he's in an airport right now, so he has to, like, he's, like, handling with  his bags and stuff, so he has to go outside really quick to get on the phone, because  we just called him to try it.  Oh, okay, so it's not our guy's fault?  No, we were trying to accelerate this process.  We always assume it's Arthur's fault.  Is that Arthur?  Oh, never mind.  Missed my opportunity.  Never mind.  Yeah, let's say hi to Bill Burr. 
[02:59:00]  Hey, Bill, you're at an airport there?  No, I'm actually, I just got into my powerful Prius.  Ah, ooh.  During the witching hour out here, right at dusk where it switches over from coyotes to  dogs.  What?  Where the fuck are you?  I'm in my neighborhood, man.  I had to take my dog out at six in the morning, and that's a scary time out here.  Yeah, what?  Ugh.  Why do you have to take your dog out so early? 
[02:59:30]  Because it's got a shit.  Why are you upset?  Why would you get something that you have to get up early for?  Yeah, get newspaper.  You do what?  It's just...  It's a wonderful thing, Anthony.  No, it seems inconvenient.  I'd rather...  At least I don't have to take it out and walk it.  I could sleep in.  I could sleep late.  It never bitches.  It's fantastic.  I love it.  Do you see coyotes?  Anthony, I finally have something in my life that's alive and dependent on me. 
[03:00:00]  You're going to ruin it this early in the morning?  It's not even human.  That's funny.  You've got to work your way up to a human being able to be dependent on you.  Do you see coyotes that early in the morning, Bill?  What's that?  Do you see the coyotes?  Although I see them, yeah.  This is the thing, too.  It's not like they...  It's not like there's a pack of them, but they definitely...  It's kind of like Punch and John.  If you see one, you know there's another one around there.  They're very sneaky sons of bitches. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  Your dog could probably fucking rack some ass of one of those things, right?  Oh, yeah.  It doesn't mess with my dog, but I think if I was just out there by myself, I think it  would take a shot at me.  Holy shit.  If we heard that Bill Burr was attacked by coyotes...  I would find out where he's working that week in the studio.  There's nothing about being a redhead.  You just don't get any respect on any level.  Not even from the coyotes.  What kind of dog do you have, Billy?  I got a pit bull.  Yeah.  That he got from somebody else, so you don't know what issues... 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  Who's that, Rich Paul?  Yeah, what's going on, man?  What's up, Richard?  How's it going?  A pit bull?  You're not scared.  I'm about ready to go to the airport again.  It's going to make me hate humanity.  You know, last time I was in the airport, this is the kind of animal that I saw.  I was in Dallas.  I saw somebody eat three Egg McMuffins, and when they were done, they wiped their face  with the bag.  That's America for you right there.  That's America.  Where was Steve C. flying to? 
[03:01:30]  I saw another dude.  He was so fat, his back itched, and he went up against a support pole for the airport and  was scratching it like a grizzly bear.  Like a bear.  Yeah.  Fucking bears do that.  Once again, that's America for you.  God damn.  Absolute animals.  Me and Bonnie will play how many people walk by are fat out of ten.  And it's usually like seven fucking people are fat.  Yeah, we're a disgustingly fat country.  Fucking disgusting.  I don't mind if somebody's fat and they're sitting there eating a salad, but when they're 
[03:02:00]  just throwing more McDonald's down, like a pelican this guy was eating, it makes the  murderous thoughts that go through my head is ridiculous.  Yeah, why does that make us so angry, though?  Because I understand there's fat people out there that are trying to do the right thing.  Because if you sat there and want...  This is what makes us angry, because they're doing what we all want to do.  Okay, there you go.  They don't want to sit there and go to KFC and then go eat some cupcakes.  We just don't do it.  That would be nice.  They're living the dream.  I want some Popeye's chicken right now, but I won't do it. 
[03:02:30]  I want it so bad.  I think Bill finally hit it.  You get mad at these people because they're doing exactly what you really subconsciously want  to be doing, eating anything in sight.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, a big hunk of fudge.  Oh, I love that right now.  Oh, they're animals.  They walk it down with syrup.  They're animals.  And you know, like if you went after a fat person in the audience, the crowd's ooh, but  if you go after a skinny person, they don't give a fuck. 
[03:03:00]  Once you attack a fat person, you're like the meanest person alive.  Because you're attacking the majority.  But if you attack an alcoholic, they don't give a fuck about that.  It's the same.  You're just a fucking disease stricken, covering the pain with whatever fucking drug.  And food is your drug.  Disease.  I like that Bill Burr figured it out for everybody.  That's fucking great.  Because I always wondered why I get mad at those people.  Because they're not in my life.  They don't even affect me.  Yeah.  I don't care what happens to them.  If they're making their own choices. 
[03:03:30]  That's a fucking perfect analogy.  The only time I care is like everyone else when you're on a fucking flight and their fatness  is in your seat.  That's the only time I give a shit.  How many times in a plane do you want to say, see this?  This is an invisible fucking window.  Mm-hmm.  Don't lean over.  But you can't say it.  Mm-hmm.  Well, that guy scratching himself up against the pole.  If he can't itch it, he can't wash it either.  And then he's going to be sitting next to you, man.  It's disgusting.  That's a good point.  That's a good point. 
[03:04:00]  Bill, you just got us after we talked for like an hour and 40 minutes straight.  Oh, yeah.  You know what?  I actually called it six.  The stuff you were talking about sounded really interesting.  I'm not being a dick here.  It actually doesn't...  Wait, what were we talking about at six?  You were talking about how they're encouraging the local jocks to talk about, you know, the  local rest areas between Milwaukee and Green Bay as a way to try to beat satellite radio.  Oh, okay. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  Six o'clock your time.  I got all confused.  It's more interesting than the way I just explained it.  But it was interesting.  Yeah.  Well, you guys all do the local radio and, you know, you have to do it for ticket sales  at times, but it's got to be a nightmare.  Yeah, well, there's always that one local town that everybody looks down on so it makes  them feel better about themselves, you know?  So there'll always be somebody like, oh, yeah, look at this chick.  I bet she sounds like she's from Maynard.  And then everyone will laugh and you're thinking, what the hell is Maynard?  All right, that must be like Revere in Boston. 
[03:05:00]  Or Bayshore on Long Island.  Yeah.  Yeah, Bayshore.  That's the go-to town for us Long Island boys.  I'm trying to, sorry.  What are you doing?  I'm so distracted trying to get in and buy Yankee World Series tickets.  But we're doing a radio show.  Yeah, but they go fast.  Are they already selling those?  Yeah, they started, I think, at 10 o'clock this morning the tickets go on sale.  Why wouldn't they, Bill? 
[03:05:30]  No, no, it's over, dude.  It's over.  Yeah, I know.  It's not even a, they are a juggernaut.  It's over.  You aren't even a, you're not a fan of any of those California teams, are you?  L.A. Kings.  I like their hockey team.  All right.  I mean, as far as baseball goes, you're fucking Red Sox forever.  And you're not living out there going go Dodgers or Anaheim.  Well, I always root against the Yankees.  But this year it's futile.  It's futile.  They finally, they finally got, they got, they finally bought the right guys. 
[03:06:00]  There's always that.  That just never fails.  That's kind of true, though, man.  Come on.  They finally bought the right guys.  Buy shitty guys?  That's, that's, that's, you put it to, that's, are you still playing golf with Billy?  I didn't say, I said they finally bought the right, dude, they threw around a lot of money  at a bunch of guys who were, were a bust.  Kevin Brown, Jason Giambi in a lot of ways was a bust.  Yes.  You know, they, they spent a Javier, whatever the hell that guy's name was, the guy threw  like four games for him. 
[03:06:30]  I'm saying they, they finally got the right guys.  Yeah, you're right.  You're, you're right.  They look amazing.  You've been watching at all?  I watched, uh, I like CC Sabathia.  He just looks like an old school baseball player, you know?  Yeah.  He's got the gut.  He just looks like he's probably got some butterfinger on his, on his throwing hand.  A little butterfinger.  He's got that Gaylord Perry vibe.  So I actually, I really like that guy.  But it's going to kill me to watch the Yankees win it.  But I've resigned my, I just, there's no way. 
[03:07:00]  Don't count the Phillies out yet, my friend.  I just think it was so.  I think that's going to be a hell of a World Series if it continues the way it's going.  Yankees-Phillies is going to be a lot of fun.  It was so cool watching him actually, watching a pitcher pitch like eight fucking innings  in a playoff game like that, in a postseason game.  It's just, uh, because you just don't see it.  They're changing the pitcher every fucking pitch.  It's infuriating.  Hey, you guys are only going with the three-man rotation? 
[03:07:30]  Yep.  I don't know.  I don't know if I like that.  Well, they rest tonight.  And then, uh, what do we got?  AJ coming up and then, and then Pettit?  Can't you just make it exciting and put Jabba Chamberlain in for one day?  Fuck that fucking piece of shit.  Yeah, he doesn't like him, Bill.  I don't like that guy at all.  Not a fan of his.  He comes in and I'm like, ah, this is either going to rule or suck ass.  And usually sucks ass.  Holy shit, I, uh, for $1,700 I could get a good seat if I could even get in. 
[03:08:00]  Use your connections.  You can't get in there?  No.  How do I get tickets?  Are you buying tickets?  You have to wait until it's on sale.  It's not on sale yet.  10 a.m.  I can't even get to your page, though.  I can't buy tickets.  What are the two mayors going to bet from Philly and York?  Oh, God.  Ah.  Hey, Anthony, have you been to the new Yankee Stadium yet?  Yes.  It's fucking amazing.  I went to a couple of the playoff games.  What's that?  Did you see the butcher?  Wasn't that amazing?  The what? 
[03:08:30]  The guy behind glass cutting up cube steaks.  What a ballpark.  There is fine rest.  I have never seen a group of fans getting raped more than anyone who walks into Yankee Stadium.  It's like $26 for a hot dog.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, but you get waiters come and bring it to you in your seat.  No, you don't.  You're just sitting there looking at a baseball diamond.  At the end of the day, the grass is green the same way it is in Milwaukee.  It's a joke. 
[03:09:00]  But they got a museum in there, and they got, like, fucking a steakhouse and a hard rock.  They have a hard rock at the Yankee Stadium?  Oh, yeah.  It's like a mall.  It's a mall.  They opened it up.  Do you know they actually opened up Yankee Stadium when the Yankees were playing over there in Anaheim?  For people to go in for free, they could sit and watch the game on the big screen at Yankee Stadium.  But they're paying, like, those ridiculous prices for the beer and the hot dogs and everything else. 
[03:09:30]  It's a brilliant idea.  Brilliant idea.  Let them just come in.  The fantasy is that somehow they finally go bankrupt.  It was all just a lie, this whole big media market that they were just robbing Peter to pay Paul, and they just go bankrupt.  Peter's check bounces.  It's all about advertising in that fucking place.  I actually do an impression of Derek Jeter taking a strike right down the middle of the plate. 
[03:10:00]  If you want to see the impression I'm doing, actually, on my MySpace page.  Oh, really?  I have a picture of it.  It's not a picture of me, but it's the impression that I do, where the ball goes right down the middle of the plate,  and he jumps his legs out like he almost is trying to get hit by the ball.  And I swear to God, 30% of the time, he gets it called for a ball.  It's one of the greatest moves in sports.  I see that move.  It's great.  When it's on the outside of the plate, he does, like, that lean over, and his momentum carries him across the plate. 
[03:10:30]  And he's just going to get out like that, wow, that sure was outside look on his face.  I like when they're low, and he, like, almost touches the ball with his nose on the low pitches.  Like, he follows it down.  Like, oh, that was another one.  Low.  Yeah, no, he's a total classic.  I can't make fun of that guy.  But I got to admit, that move is genius.  Yeah.  Boy, what the fuck happened the other night where A-Rod squeezed Jeter's ass? 
[03:11:00]  I swear to you, he walked up in the dugout behind Jeter after a run scored  and just grabbed his ass and squeezed it really hard.  Very.  But you've done, Anthony.  Very.  He's banged every good-looking woman out there.  Last one, I guess, was Madonna.  He got her in her last, I guess you'd want to fuck her year.  He's ready to move on.  He's got Kate Hudson right now.  Yeah, he's banging Kate Hudson. 
[03:11:30]  Get out of here.  Where have you been, man?  That's perfect.  We're looking at a shot of Jeter doing that move that you're talking about.  It's perfect.  And it's a strike right down the middle, like Bill said.  It's right down the middle of the plate, and you would think it was coming right at his ball sack.  He is bent in a complete, like, L shape with his legs straight out.  But it looks like, yeah, it looks like that ball should be skimming off his belt buckle  and blow right by the catcher. 
[03:12:00]  I'll fucking tweet it for everybody.  It's beautiful.  Dude, I'm telling you, he does it all the time.  It's brilliant.  I am now going to have to notice that and laugh every time.  That is a fantastic move.  You hear what he was doing also when someone's on second,  and they start leading, right before the pitcher pitches, he starts going,  Hey!  Hey!  He yells hey to the guy.  Like, hey, where are you going?  Hey!  Oh, A-Rod?  Jeter does that. 
[03:12:30]  Jeter starts yelling.  I thought it was an A-Rod.  I don't know.  Yeah, he's yelling at the guy.  What are you going to do?  I mean, you know what?  They're just a tough bunch of knock-around guys.  They just sort of assemble them, you know?  They're just a little team that could.  You know what drives me nuts when the Yankees go on like a six-game winning streak  and they're on ESPN and they're like,  The Yankees are really starting to heat up.  It's like, they should be undefeated. 
[03:13:00]  Ah, shit.  What happened to your Sox, though, this year?  Ah, we didn't have it this year.  I don't know what happened.  And in July, all of a sudden, we just never recovered.  When are they dumping Big Sloppy?  Jesus Christ, enough with Big Poppy already.  Wait a minute.  What?  Let me tell you.  We're just waiting to find the next drug that they don't know how to test for yet,  like whatever A-Rod's on. 
[03:13:30]  And we'll move away.  You know what I love about A-Rod?  And it's like, what was the shelf life of that guy getting caught for being on Roy?  They're already talking about what a great playoff he's having.  I'm telling you.  He's just as big as he was when he was on Roy.  And nobody's saying anything.  The guy is enormous.  He's enormous.  So you think it's something that they haven't been able to test for yet?  Well, I read this thing on Belco one time, about Belco, and they were saying, it was what was hilarious. 
[03:14:00]  It was one of the guys who worked there.  He used to be in that band Tower of Power, which I thought was hilarious, but that was his parachute out of being a musician.  And he was saying how the drugs are always going to be ahead of the testing because the testing has to go through all kinds of approvals with the players' union.  And they've got to figure out what they're taking.  But when you're making illegal drugs, it's like you're sprinting.  No one's stopping you.  There's no...  It's true, yep.  You know what I mean?  So you're always going to be like 12 steps ahead of them. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  You're thinking he's doing something.  Yeah, everybody forgot about all the controversy, and it's just like, hey, it's Mr. October now.  Look at him go.  Yeah.  He's flying.  Now he's a Yankee.  They're a mercenary team of free agents.  That's what they are.  Cano, Peter, Rivera, Posada, Pettit.  I don't get mad at those guys.  I actually really like the 98 Yankees, but the Yankees come off the bat as like the fucking Oscars. 
[03:15:00]  I keep waiting for them.  What's their name?  I can never remember the name.  What the fuck was the name of that chick who wasn't even good looking, but she had her hair done like she was.  And one of those sitcoms.  I forget.  I can never remember the name.  I'm laughing at it.  Nice description.  All right, Bill, let us go.  We've got to take a break and take leaks and shit.  Fucking funny, man.  Can I hype what I'm hyping?  Please.  Yeah, of course.  We hyped it a little bit, but do it again for us.  We added a second show Thursday at the DC Infra. 
[03:15:30]  Wow.  So please come down so I'm not standing there in an empty room.  That's fucking good.  That means ticket sales are very good for you.  Ticket sales have been great.  DC has always supported me thanks to my affiliation with the wonderful Opie and Anthony radio program.  Absolutely.  I like that.  DCimprov.com for tickets.  And when are you coming to see us again, Bill?  I'm doing Town Hall November 6th, and I will be in that Thursday and Friday whoring myself out. 
[03:16:00]  And you're going to ask me about getting a gun.  Well, you guys got to go shoot me.  Nice.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're getting a gun?  That's the rumor.  That's the rumor.  That's the rumor.  What?  Jeez.  Do I have a pit bull?  A gun?  What the fuck is that?  There's coyotes out there, Bill.  Coyotes.  Coyotes.  Just the coyotes.  I need a little protection.  I need license to carry.  Yeah, there you go.  So that's what they're calling now, coyotes.  California's such a big state. 
[03:16:30]  California's a rough one.  To get a gun?  Yeah.  Get a pistol.  Yeah.  Carry.  All right.  We got to take a break.  We've been at it for two hours now.  It's crazy.  Bill Burr doing a great phone-up for everybody.  Bill, thanks.  We'll see you soon, all right?  Later, Bill.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  Thank you later.  All right.  Bill Burr, DC Improv.  Second show added the, what?  Tomorrow night?  Tomorrow night, DCimprov.com for tickets.  It's like the Oscars.  And that Dirk Jeter picture is, well, fuck, I guess everyone's on my Twitter because it's  taking forever to upload, but the Dirk Jeter making believe a strike isn't a strike picture. 
[03:17:00]  It's perfect.  Bill Burr nailed it.  It'll be on my Twitter, OP Radio, in a few seconds here, hopefully.  I never even noticed that, but when he said it, it's like, I didn't even have to look  at the picture.  I knew exactly what he was talking about when he said it.  But then you see the picture.  Yeah.  The ball is right down the middle, and he's making it look like he's getting out of the  way of the ball hitting his fucking dick.  So, it's a perfect strike.  We'll break.  Rich Voss continues with us, and we're going to say hi to Jason Ellis as well. 
[03:17:30]  He's calling in to promote something.  Yep.  OP and Anthony, stay there.  Travis, what do you think?  I'm a rookie?  What's wrong with you?  He's playing this because Shannon Hoon of Blind Melon, Anthony, died 14 years ago today.  Holy shit.  The one-hit wonder that was Shannon Hoon.  Wow.  He might have had more talent, but we will never know that.  So, now he's just known as the one-hit wonder with the B-Girl video. 
[03:18:00]  That's right.  That was the big B-Girl video.  She's not a sex book.  It was released 17 years ago.  What was it?  Oh, you want to go back to the B-Girl?  I'm sorry.  No, no, no.  No, no, I just had some bad.  Sorry, no exact matches were found.  What happened?  But other tickets may still be available.  I didn't even...  I didn't even...  I put best available at any price.  Let me explain.  Yankee World Series tickets go on sale at 10 a.m. this morning.  During the break, Anthony was up on the website. 
[03:18:30]  Danny was up on the website getting ready to get their World Series tickets.  And you're completely fucked.  Which happened a minute after 10 o'clock, right?  Yes.  Sold out to everyone?  You can't get a ticket?  Any price.  And I didn't even...  So why do they promote that World Series tickets are going on sale at 10 when they know this shit is going to happen,  that the average fan is shut out of this stuff?  I can't even tell you the last time I got tickets from Ticketmaster.  And, like, you know, something went on sale at a certain time and I got tickets. 
[03:19:00]  Right.  Everything I've tried to ever get in the last...  And this isn't, like, a few months.  I mean, I'm talking, like, years.  The average guy gets fucking shut out.  You cannot get tickets.  I know.  If you're trying to send me a helium, I'm sure you can.  There's no...  Rich Ross, helium guy, country club, playing golf.  You know, no way to get tickets, like, through the normal channels of getting tickets.  You have to go to the ticket brokers, scalpers, shit like that, which are legal scalpers, the ticket brokers,  because all they're doing is fucking somehow figuring out a scam to get them. 
[03:19:30]  What do you mean somehow figuring out?  200 computers in a room or whatever.  There's some deals, in my humble opinion, going on.  Yeah, there's got to be.  I'll give you first dibs at this, but you're going to have to grease my palm a little bit.  The second the page went live for getting tickets...  The exact second.  Like, I was refreshing the page.  We were, like, all fucking just...  No, you guys were right there.  The second it came up, I put in a request.  I put in there little stupid words that you've got to do, and it was gone.  Like, a second.  Are they saying all tickets are gone, or you just can't even get on the site anymore?  No, I can get on, but, I mean, it keeps coming back. 
[03:20:00]  I can't...  It says that tickets might be available, but not in the same row.  So I put in a request for one ticket to see if I could just get one ticket.  One ticket.  And you're still waiting?  Yeah, yeah, the little thing says you're waiting times.  Is this for all the games?  Not just for one game.  Oh, the first game?  I think the first two games went on sale.  Yeah, something else is going on, too.  Technically.  Ant and Danny trying to get Yankee World Series tickets, and Rich Voss had a revelation.  He goes, oh, my God, with this new iPhone, I don't have to bring my computer on the road anymore.  That's what we were saying.  It's unbelievable how... 
[03:20:30]  Anthony's been doing that for a year.  Where have you been?  I don't have to lug around a computer bag anymore, go on the road.  It's everything you need.  Even porno, you could jack to the little picture.  It's a little small, but, you know, you could...  This is how it is from now on.  What?  It's radio.  Your little fag bag.  With my iPhone in it.  All right, so then you don't need the fag bag anymore.  Get rid of the fag bag.  Get rid of the fag bag.  Get rid of your little girly bag.  Get rid of the bag.  No fucking way.  That bag gets me.  You know what that bag gets me?  What?  Abuse. 
[03:21:00]  This thing, I was asking Dan...  You guys, I'm surprised they don't have a traveling keyboard  that you can put this in.  Like, they do that with palms and stuff.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Why would you need a traveling keyboard?  They do.  Do you know what I'm saying?  They do.  Do they have it?  Yeah.  And you put it on top and you...  Like, this is the computer with a keyboard.  They have a keyboard that you can use.  Most people don't really need the keyboard, though.  They want to really just throw their fucking iPhone in their back pocket and go.  As a matter of fact, don't they have that roll-up keyboard?  I like...  Yeah, they do. 
[03:21:30]  I just don't know what's compatible with the iPhone.  Like, I've seen stuff like that, but I just...  I don't know what they make for the iPhone, unfortunately.  I don't need...  What's the...  I don't use a keyboard, so I don't give a shit.  I use my touch screen.  Here's a common subject.  If you bought a ticket from a broker for the World Series, what do you think?  What would it start at, you think?  Something like that.  A couple hundred dollars.  No.  Perhaps.  By the way, there were no exact matches for my ticket request, which was one ticket.  One ticket.  At any price.  At any price.  You guys were on this site immediately.  Listen, I think Jason Ellis is standing by.  Jason.  Yes, mate. 
[03:22:00]  Sorry about that.  I mean, you were supposed to call about an hour ago, but we're in the middle of one of  those weird fucking shows.  We're way the fuck behind.  You do whatever the fuck you want.  You're the fucking dude that's a millionaire, and you got your own fucking channel, and you  just fly around fucking chicken, jacking off on fucking iPhones.  You go ahead and do what you want.  I'm scum of the earth, and I'm on my way, so you just fuck me over royally, and I'll  enjoy myself.  Don't even worry about it.  At least you understand, right, Jason?  And Anthony, if you want to get some of the Ticketmaster, you can fucking come see Ellis  Mania at Ticketmaster.  They'll still sell those fucking things, because nobody fucking cares, because we're shitbags. 
[03:22:30]  Wait, what's happening?  You're doing an event, and no one's buying tickets?  That can't be possible.  You got to keep following.  It's not sold out.  Oh, you want the big sellout, right?  How many tickets are left?  Yeah, I want people to freak out.  What do we got going on?  It's an Oktoberfest?  It's Oktoberfist.  Well, they fucking wrote Oktoberfest.  I'm like, well...  It's because they're morons!  I'm like, well, who gives a shit if he's drinking beer with Germans, but I...  I don't even drink.  I hate Germans.  That Duhas band makes me want to fucking shoot myself. 
[03:23:00]  Duhas, Duhas, meh.  Meh.  You're lucky I don't have a gun right now.  We love that Duhas.  It just makes people angry.  I don't know.  It's one of those...  It's marching Nazi music.  It's supposed to make you angry.  There you go.  There you go.  That song is supposed to make you angry, Jason.  Yes.  Oh.  That's the scene...  No, okay, so it's Oktoberfest.  That sounds way more exciting than an Oktoberfest.  As in punching somebody in the fucking face with your fist.  That's what it's all about. 
[03:23:30]  And this happened at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas this Saturday?  Yeah, Hard Rock.  I'm doing radio shows there Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, but the Everlast, it's like a whole  weekend of shit.  Everlast is on Friday night.  Then on Saturday, Ellis Mania, the fight's on where there's three dudes blindfolded with  electric dog collars on their necks, and they're fighting each other blindfolded while  I electrocute the fuck out of whoever's doing really good.  Everyone's getting electrocuted, but it's really good, because I've tried it before 
[03:24:00]  Ellis Mania 3.  If you turn it up high, I don't know if it hurts, because I'm not wearing it, because  it's Ellis Mania, not whoever this cocksucker mania is.  Right.  But they actually sort of have a spasm, and their shoulder blades lock up, so they look  like they're pretending to be a chicken.  While somebody else punches them in the face, blindfolded, it's pretty fucking funny.  I think Anthony's thinking the exact same thing I'm thinking.  Do you have the same fucking lawyers as we do?  Are you able to do this? 
[03:24:30]  I'm not really on the radio.  No one's listening to me, assholes.  Hey, look, take the good with the bad.  I'm scum of the earth, and I can do anything I want, because no one's listening.  All right, Jason.  No one cares.  You're making a good point, and I'll tell you.  Enjoy your time off the radar, because eventually you will be on the radar, and they'll say no  to every single thing you did to become popular.  Because that's the stage of the career we're at right now.  Everything that got us to where we are, we can't do anymore.  The difference is between you and me is I was already massacring myself before I got on 
[03:25:00]  the radio, so you can't take my massacring job away from me.  I broke bones and knocked myself out for 15 years before I got a job in radio, so you  can't say that now that I'm the Jason Ellis show, I'm not allowed to smash myself and  my friends.  See, God bless you.  That's illegal.  Well, let me explain something really fast.  Hold on, Jason.  Let me explain.  We're to a point we can't get porn stars in here to insert stuff in their vaginas. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah, I got a porn star to put a phone in a porn star's ass.  Nice.  Did you try to ring the phone?  We did that.  But this, no, of course I rang the phone and I thanked my mom through her ass on radio.  There you go.  But that was before, this was two years ago, before I was even allowed to be on the radio.  I was just illegally doing that.  Now, I'm not allowed to insert anything either, so I'm with you guys.  All right, so the insertion thing is off limits for satellite radio radio shows.  It is fun.  It is.  It's really weird that it's fun that it's on the radio because most people aren't seeing 
[03:26:00]  that it's actually inserting, but they can hear the joy in your words.  Of course.  All everyone chuckling and having a great time inserting things.  I completely agree.  Let's take another step here.  On regular radio, they told us this insertion thing.  So Ant and I, we go, all right, you know what?  We're going to fucking, and we were doing this to prove a point.  We're like, we're going to make believe we have a naked girl in studio.  The fucking lawyers actually sat us down and said, you can't even make believe there's  a naked girl in the studio.  And I'm like, how does that get anyone in fucking trouble? 
[03:26:30]  I mean, we would never do dishonest radio like that for our listeners, but still, we  were making the point that these lawyers are fucking out of their minds.  It's just old people, man.  They just don't get it.  That's why they shouldn't be allowed to vote when they're 65.  That's the cutoff point.  Just shut the fuck up and go smoke some weed.  Video games are awesome.  You know what I mean?  When you're 65, get high, play video games.  Shut the fuck up.  It's my fucking time to do stuff.  You just leave me alone.  When I'm 65, I don't want you to listen to me at all.  Don't worry, because guess what?  I don't want to fucking tell you anything anyway. 
[03:27:00]  I just want video games where I can pretend I'm some sort of sword dude, and I want to  jump off stuff and shoot people.  You know what I mean?  Have a video game where I get hookers.  It's all fucking clean fun.  Just shut up.  He can get away with more, though, because he has an accent, and when you have an accent,  you can get away with fucking...  It's not my fault.  I was just born there.  Yeah, I get that one.  Yeah, but you know, I was that thing you were saying.  I remember the first time I was on your show, when I got off the show, I heard the replay,  and you were saying, oh, so much.  He's so into it, and he's so energized. 
[03:27:30]  He has no idea what he's in store for.  Right.  And I really, I was like, what the fuck do these guys mean?  Right.  And now, because I've got Ellis Mania, I've got my band, Taint Sticks album comes out October  27th.  Our band, I sing, I'm fucking knocking out some cocksucker from MTV on Saturday, and then  right after I knock that cocksucker out, because he's got a TV show, he shouldn't have a TV show.  Wait, wait, wait.  I'm way more amused.  I don't know who you're fighting.  Andy Bell from Nitro Circus. 
[03:28:00]  Okay.  You watch Nitro Circus?  I do not.  Right.  You're almost done.  You realize that?  I know.  You don't watch it.  You don't watch Nitro Circus.  It's men smashing shit.  Okay, that's good.  Doesn't tantalize you in any way?  I'm going to take a peek now.  Check it out.  One of them has tits and smashes shit.  Now do I have you.  What are you talking about?  I already have tits.  Is it a guy that has tits?  One's a girl.  Oh.  Sorry.  A vagina.  Sorry.  Let me clarify.  Yes.  Yes.  A clitoris and the, you know what I mean, the whole thing that goes in there behind that, 
[03:28:30]  whatever that other stuff is.  A fucking hymen.  Yes.  I feel like I'm talking to my mum now.  How's it going, mum?  In a vagina.  Great to have a look.  Oh, no.  Aye, no.  Oh, no.  Yeah, but I'm going to knock him out and then I'm going to sing.  So that means I've been doing rehearsals for Taint Stick and training for this fight and  radio and dealing with people that are, because the more I'm on the radio, the more the people  are like, yeah, can you not do this?  Can you not do that?  I'm like, well, no, no.  I can do everything. 
[03:29:00]  Well, you can fuck off because I don't, I don't really care about anybody.  You just shut up your ass and I can just go fucking make a video of smashing shit  and I'll be okay.  Right.  And now I can tell because now I'm in, I'm stuck in this thing where I'm like, I've got  to go, I've got to go, I've got to win, I want to beat everyone, I've got to be the  biggest thing in radio.  What are you going to do to do that?  And now that I actually can see what you've got to do to do that, by the time that I  am really famous and rich like yourselves, fuck off.  What the fuck do I want to fucking talk to you about anything? 
[03:29:30]  Why do I want to say anything for four or five hours to fucking anyone?  I've already had to fucking talk my fucking bullshit to some cocksucker all day about  letting me say fuck.  So you get it.  We don't talk to management.  I completely get it.  All right.  We don't talk to management.  We don't talk to lawyers.  We just do our show, do the best we can, and we get the fuck out of here.  I just like to say thank you to Steve Blatter, though.  Just in case he doesn't think, I hope Steve Blatter doesn't think that I'm actually directing  this conversation at him.  I'm just saying the man in general.  You've got to know how to work that, too, Jason. 
[03:30:00]  Let me give you a lesson.  You're fucking, you motherfuck these guys like crazy, and then when they look you in  the eye, you go, you know what?  That was for the show.  You know that.  The average guy out there doesn't like their boss either, so that's all we're doing.  We actually respect you.  You've got to do that shit when you see him.  Yeah.  I want to punch everybody in the face, though.  I know.  That's why we got you on the ISDN line.  It's safer this way.  Not you guys.  I don't want to punch you guys.  It's safer this way.  You're the only guys that actually like me.  Yeah, I like you.  Oy. 
[03:30:30]  You're the only guy that's liked me and then didn't say later on that I was a cocksucker.  So, you know, I really like you.  You and Pharrell.  That's it.  That's all I remember.  Pharrell's a cocksucker.  Fuck Pharrell.  I ran it to him, and we kind of made up a little bit, so.  I still think Pharrell's a dude.  You don't like Pharrell?  Nah, jiggity, jiggity, jiggity.  Shut the fuck up.  We fucking...  Cunt.  You're like a cunt?  I hate Pharrell.  I actually ran into him, and we kind of made up a little bit.  It's very confusing, Jason.  I don't have a problem with him. 
[03:31:00]  I can't do that.  I can't do that.  I'll go with you on the fucking Love Sponge, but I'm not going with you on the Pharrell.  I like Pharrell.  You don't like that big, fat mess?  No, because he changes his mind all the time.  At one point, I was a fucking cool guy, and then when I moved to the same time slot as  him, and everybody realizes that, really, if you listen to radio, I am far more superior  than this fucking blob.  I can tell you this much.  And then he talked shit on me and tried to bury me.  Now we're patching things up again, and I think after the last five words, I just said  we're enemies again.  Well, good.  Wait until Pharrell just turns around and stabs you in the back. 
[03:31:30]  Pharrell has never done that.  And he hasn't done that.  Until he does, he is my boy.  All right.  I'm just saying.  Until he does.  No, I'm just saying.  When he does, at least you're a big guy.  That was Mania 5.  Anthony versus Pharrell.  Smack him in his face.  You don't like Pharrell?  Still the dick bag.  Shig-a-doop, shig-a-doop, shig-a-doop.  Ah, we're going to be talking about this.  Shig-a-doop, shig-a-doop.  All right.  I don't understand why you're competing with him.  He's a sports show.  Nah, I'm not competing with him.  It has nothing to do with competing. 
[03:32:00]  You just don't like the guy?  He dog-dicked us.  What does a dog-dick mean?  He dog-dicked us once.  What does he do?  Ah, he's fucking talked shit.  Let's get it off your chest.  Come on.  He talked shit about us when we said nothing.  I heard him on the radio saying he lied to you guys again.  Yeah, well, that's this week.  Yeah, just like you, though, Jason, it does get confusing because we came to Satellite Radio  and Scott was, like, motherfuckering us and we're like, wow, we didn't say shit about him.  Yeah.  Maybe he was a stern thing.  And then, of course, we attacked him.  Yeah, because that's what...  It probably was, but you know something? 
[03:32:30]  Who gives a fuck who's working here?  And what?  Swinging me.  You got to, like, come over to Sirius because we were at X7 at the time.  Yeah, but honestly, I can understand in a way.  I swing from Tony Hawk's nuts and if you come on and you were attacking Tony Hawk, then I'll  come at you.  It wasn't even that.  I was like...  Wait, I want in on this.  This is what happens to a lot of people.  And you know what?  I don't feel like naming names, but it's very obvious who the people are.  Like, they get in Howard's corner and then feel like they have to, like, fight Howard's  battle and shit instead of continuing to be an individual. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah.  Like, be yourself.  Be an individual.  And make it on your own.  Everyone latched onto his teat when they came over here.  All of a sudden...  I do understand that.  I have said that I like Howard Stern and you guys in the same sentence.  And your fans are like, what the fuck?  How is that even possible?  And I'm like, what do you mean?  You know, it's fine to say you listen to Howard, you like Howard and everything.  It doesn't mean...  But if you're Pharrell and we've been working at the same radio stations together and had  him as a guest and on the phone all the time and been friendly with him, been out drinking  with him, whatever, and then he comes over here and, you know, starts sucking on Howard's 
[03:33:30]  teat and then just starts dicking us and bad-mouthing us, he could go fuck himself.  Wait, let me tag what Anthony's saying because you've...  All of a sudden, people like that feel like, well, now that Howard has taken me under his  wing, I now have to be this motherfucker toward Opie and Anthony.  Instead of like, why don't you just continue being an individual?  And the other thing I want to say that came up in this, Jason, believe it or not, and  this will surprise people, when you say stuff like, I like Opie and Anthony and Howard, 
[03:34:00]  I actually respect that.  I do.  Right.  Because it's probably a dangerous thing to say because one of you might get offended by it.  No, I respect that you're...  That's how you feel and that's what you said.  I do respect that, okay?  That's fine.  I mean, what Bubba did is an embarrassment to himself in radio.  I mean, this guy fought Howard tooth and nail and next thing you know, he's kissing his  ass like that.  That is embarrassing.  That is embarrassing shit.  He could have continued being an individual if he believed in himself in his radio show,  but he felt once again, well, Howard is accepting me, so now I got to like, you know, lick his 
[03:34:30]  fucking tain and then I got to take on Opie and Anthony and everyone else that still don't  like Howard.  That's some lame ass shit.  I think every guy would be the same and they would have respect for somebody who just did  whatever they were doing and didn't change anything, no matter who they work for.  Let Pharrell down some fucking Jameson and call a minor league hockey game for the rest  of my life.  Opie, are you cool with Pharrell?  You know, I...  Are you about to change your mind as well right now?  This is so fucked up, dude.  You're really fucking things up. 
[03:35:00]  No, honestly, this is what happened.  I like that dude.  I really like that dude.  He's actually been a good friend of mine.  Hear me out.  I walked through the SiriusXM studios at night one time because I live, you know, in Manhattan,  so I stopped by later on in the afternoon sometime and I saw him and I go, I thought  you were supposed to punch me in the face.  And then we talked a little bit and he explained why he did some of the things he did.  I was like, all right, but at least you're explaining it.  And we did hug and they were shaking it up and we went our own ways and I haven't thought  about him since.  It's the same as he hates Dana.  Him and Dana White had a falling out. 
[03:35:30]  I'm good friends with Dana White.  I ain't going to fuck, you know what I mean?  I fucking love Dana White because another guy that speaks his mind and doesn't like  change his tune because of who's liking him that day.  That's what I like about that dude, too.  That's what I should mention.  Yeah.  No, go ahead.  He's got the UFC on this Saturday as well, but really, no offense to Dana White, Ellis Mania  is really where it's at.  That was smart, Jason.  Yeah, going up against...  Fucking hell.  I didn't know.  God damn it.  Going up against UFC.  That's real smart.  It's different.  This one's got...  Okay, well then check this out.  Does Dana White have a fucking porn star fighting a dude? 
[03:36:00]  Hey, that's pretty cool.  No.  In your face, White.  Who is that?  Leota Machida drinks piss.  My fighter drinks fucking mad loads 24-7.  She's a whore.  She is.  Is Machida a whore?  Who's the fucking dude?  Fuck Dana White.  I've got no hair as well.  God damn it.  Who's the fucking dude fighting the porn star?  He's just my boy that like has...  He's got like a...  He never rode a bicycle.  He can't...  He's just one of these people that's like...  I told him how to...  I don't say retarded. 
[03:36:30]  I would say a fucktard or mentally challenged because I don't disrespect the mentally challenged  people, but I would say that he's more of a...  The easiest word would be pussy.  Yeah.  Who's...  Throwing in a hot shot there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's just a pussy and he doesn't know how to bounce a basketball.  I just told him how to ride a bike for the first time the other day.  He's one of those people that plays chess.  And you can't...  Oh, okay.  And you can't believe why people in Vegas aren't going to see this and are going to Circus  Olay casino?  Circus Olay is fake.  This is real.  Somebody's going to get punched in the face.  I'm going to fucking really beat the shit out of this dude from MTV. 
[03:37:00]  I believe that.  Go to a fucking crap table.  Hold on.  I want to hear more about your friend.  Does he have a hint of a muscle on his body?  No, not at all.  He actually started to work out and he decided to take a bunch of protein, which didn't work  out.  So now he's 130 pounds, but he's just like a little fat skinny dude.  Is his last name Norton?  You know what?  It would be a close fight, but I think because Norton's got that weird emotional psychopath 
[03:37:30]  side to him.  And you can't hit him in a chin.  You don't know how to fight psychotic, right?  When people are psychotic, they're unpredictable.  This guy's a pacifist.  Hey, have you been teaching him how to fight abroad?  Any pointers?  No.  I told him to cheat.  I told him when they touch gloves that he should run away and bounce off the turnbuckle  and then clothesline the bitch.  Yeah.  Because she's only, I think she's four foot eight.  Jesus. 
[03:38:00]  She's 94 pounds.  Joanna Angel, if anybody wants to check her out.  I think it's JoannaAngel.com.  She actually will masturbate for you live on the internet.  I'm very excited.  Uppercut to the vulva.  Why would you teach her to fight abroad?  If you can't fight in this country, why would you be able to fight in another country?  It's Alice Mania.  Anybody can fight everybody.  What did you just say?  Are you teaching her to fight abroad?  There's two dudes that are fighting each other with one arm duct tape to their side.  Fucking hell.  What else is going on?  Hey, Jason.  Be careful with that blind boxing. 
[03:38:30]  We did it.  And one guy...  You did do it?  Yeah.  Yeah, but not with a blindfold, but real blind people.  No shit.  Oh, yeah.  No, listen to this.  And I think if you YouTube, you can find our blind boxing.  What's amazing about the one guy comes in, he pops his eyes out to prove he's blind.  He fought this guy, Blind Dave, who rules.  He did a lot for our show.  Blind Dave was a trooper.  The other guy knew how to fight.  Blind Dave walked away with...  What were all the injuries, Ant?  This is what you've got to be careful about.  Broken ribs.  Ruptured spleen.  Ruptured spleen. 
[03:39:00]  Wow.  And there was something else.  Yeah, something was wrong with his joy.  Yeah, the doctor basically said that he could have died.  Yeah, well, he's a pussy, a blind pussy at that, but these guys actually know what they're doing.  I have professional fighters that are in corners and a referee, and really, these...  Like, Joanna Angel, as we said, is 94 pounds, and Raw Dog is a humongous vaginal cavity.  So, these dudes could go to town on each other for fucking 20 minutes and nothing would happen.  The only real fight with any danger is me and Andy Bell, because Andy Bell is a motocross guy. 
[03:39:30]  He's an MTV guy.  You know, he's the Nitro Circus, friends with Travis Pastrana and all that.  So, he doesn't care if he gets knocked out, and I don't care if I get knocked out.  So, that's the real one.  You know what I mean?  The other ones, if somebody gets rocked, because I'm...  You know what I mean?  I've had a pro fight.  I know the deal.  Somebody gets rocked, and it's game over.  You get to sit down and have a beer.  You know?  I'm not going to be like,  Finish him, you fucking pussy!  I'm like, finish him!  One more thing.  Fedor. 
[03:40:00]  You got to...  Did we talk about this on our show last time you were on?  I don't...  What, did he kick me?  Yeah.  Fucking Fedor was on Jason Ellis' show.  We had Fedor on, and we were scared.  Did he kick you?  Fuck no, dude.  I'm not going to...  Well, you know why?  You got a Porsche, don't you?  No, no Porsche.  I'm not a car guy.  You got something that simulates a Porsche.  I got a nice apartment in the car.  Yeah, I want your fucking apartment, okay?  You'll get there.  You will get there.  Yeah, but I don't have...  But I'm worried...  This is the thing.  Especially after I heard your fucking replay that day, 
[03:40:30]  I was like,  I don't want to make it,  and when I...  Because I'm not...  You started younger than me.  By the time I make it,  and I get my paycheck,  I'll be flat when everybody starts listening to me.  I need to do it faster.  So I need TV shows.  I need fucking massacrists to kick me in the leg.  I need death.  Yeah.  Almost death.  So everyone's like,  who is this moron?  Let's listen to his show,  and then I'll be like,  I have money and still fury  before I tap out of five years of bullshit.  Does this bring back memories?  Ah, I love it. 
[03:41:00]  The sound of being full of piss and vinegar.  When I hang up,  do not fucking say that shit.  Great.  Does this bring back memories, then?  A guy with ambition and fucking motivation.  How do we get the whole city to talk about us today?  Ah, that's great.  Yeah.  And then we end up unemployed for a while.  It's fantastic.  You have to get fired.  That's a biggie.  If you're going to make it in this business,  you've got to get fired once  for something really good.  Really stupid.  And you've got to sit out a good year.  Check it out.  Tell Vasa about it.  You're fucking awesome.  I can't let it go now.  You're such a fucking asshole. 
[03:41:30]  I can't let it go, that cocksucker.  Fuck, come on.  Stop it, man.  Fuck him and his asshole.  Not fucking him.  I think we were surprised  because his trashing came out of nowhere  based on not much.  I can understand your angle,  but I can't do it.  Like I said,  I did a shake it up with him,  a little like fucking handshake hug thing.  You're such a fucking asshole.  I haven't seen him since.  You can't stop.  Yeah, OB,  you're the fucking asshole  because you actually fucking patched shit up  and now you're letting your boy  trash him right now.  If I had my show,  you know what?  I'd let somebody trash somebody. 
[03:42:00]  You've got to look at something called,  Ant knows what I'm going to say.  Yeah, I know.  Good cop and bad cop.  It'll get some things done for you.  Good cop, bad cop.  You ever hear it?  You know what?  My guys are always good cop,  so I'm just always the cocksucker.  And I think everyone else  is more worried about their job than I am.  The key is you've got to switch roles.  You've got to be bad cop,  and then the next day  you confuse everybody.  Tell me, tell me,  hey, tell me,  why don't you fucking start  telling everybody that they suck  so that I can be like,  dude, you've gone too far. 
[03:42:30]  Right, there you go.  Can you get on the fucking radio tomorrow  and annihilate Love Spons  and be like,  dude, the guy's just a little chubby.  Give him some fucking breaks.  This is fucking bullshit.  I always have to do it  and go down with the ship.  Before we let you go  and get the big plug in,  you've got to retell the Fedor story.  Jason isn't,  he's definitely insane.  He's not just talking a good game,  Rich Wilder.  Fedor, you know Fedor from,  well, he should be in the UFC,  but he's not.  Now he's fighting for CBS for free  or whatever.  He's selling heroin to the Russian mob.  Whatever it is, 
[03:43:00]  but he should be in the UFC.  I mean, I was just reporting that  from my producer.  He said that.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Because I completely disagree  that there's any mafia involved whatsoever.  What's the mafia?  Exactly.  Yes.  So we had Fedor in.  We just talked to him.  Jason goes,  fuck that.  I want Fedor to hit me.  So we had Fedor kick him,  I think twice.  He didn't want to.  I was trying to tell him  because he can't speak English.  So I was saying,  fucking kick me.  Will you kick me?  And he was like,  no, I will not kick you  because whatever dude telling him  this moron wants you to kick him. 
[03:43:30]  Right.  And then at one point I was like,  dude, I've had a fight.  I'm not going to sue you.  I tell this guy that I'm a crazy guy  and I don't give a fuck what he does.  Wail one on me.  It'll be a childhood dream.  Some bullshit like that.  And then he looked at me  from the other side of the table  and I was like,  come on, dude.  And I know he might not know  that the word come on,  but I was like,  come on,  fucking do it to me.  Fucking hook me up,  you prick.  And then he was like,  all right,  we'll do this.  So then we go outside  and then he gives me a leg kick  and I'm like,  come on, motherfucker. 
[03:44:00]  Like,  fucking wing one,  you know what I mean?  Like, this is bullshit.  Make it count.  So,  he winged one.  He didn't really give me 100%,  but he put one in the bone  or whatever  and it wasn't that big of a deal.  But the second one,  because I had to kind of get angry at him  to make him do it,  and then he kind of,  I just,  because you know who he is.  He kills people.  He's a naturally gifted killing machine  and our eyes locked  and he was like,  okay,  really?  And then looked at the part of the flesh  where he was going to kick 
[03:44:30]  and I was like,  wow,  this is really going to happen.  This is going to be fucking crazy.  And then for like two weeks,  every time I stood,  every time I walked that leg  when it planted on the ground,  I thought,  Fado,  Fado,  Fado,  every time I walked.  It was a legendary day for me.  Fuck that guy.  And what did you get out of it?  It's a story.  Glory,  you fucking arsehole.  You really are retarded,  aren't you?  No,  but it's a good story.  You want a fucking story?  Run in front of a bus,  stupid,  and get it over with.  Just run in front of a...  But then I don't get to tell the story. 
[03:45:00]  That's a good story.  Huh?  You don't know who Fado Emelianenko is,  do you?  Oh, man,  I'm a karate guy.  That kind of shit doesn't impress me.  A karate guy.  Karate guy.  Stop with the technical jargon there.  Jason,  next time you're in New York,  we'll have Voss come in  so you can see his karate moves.  They're terrific.  Oh,  they're terrific.  Hey,  it is a good story.  I'm just fucking...  It is a good story.  I'll give him a free kick.  What's that?  He said he'll give you a free kick.  He sounds like a karate guy  the way he says he's fighting.  I'll give you a free punch in the face  if you want one. 
[03:45:30]  No,  listen,  I don't...  No,  you can punch him in the face.  No,  it doesn't even matter.  What are you kidding me?  That's what I meant.  Say you're talking good game.  I'm not hitting you.  He's calling you out  and now you're not hitting anybody.  No,  he sounds like a karate guy.  Are you too scared to hit me?  He sounds like a karate guy  the way he's fighting that MTV.  Dude,  he's going to just let you hit him.  That's what he does.  He's not going to hit back.  I drank my piss the other day.  He knows Rich's hands are so tiny.  It's like getting hit  by one of those  little Japanese back scratchers.  Oh,  well,  maybe...  The piss thing  is supposed to be  very healthy for you,  Jason.  Yeah,  I know,  but it's so bad. 
[03:46:00]  You can't do it.  I don't know how they do it.  I lost a bet  the last UFC  so then I drank my piss  and then everyone told me  that Leo Machida  drinks piss  because I got a  paid for website  the ellismania.com  and I was on there live  while I was watching the UFC  making bets  and I don't have any  fucking money yet  so  I just bet  drinking fucking piss  instead.  You motherfuckers  talking shit up for real.  I'm over here  drinking piss  you cocksuckers. 
[03:46:30]  Fucking Porsche  driving  fucking new apartment  shiny suit  motherfucker  I'm fucking drinking  fucking my own urine  to fucking make  five bucks a month  of a cocksucker.  So anyway,  I fucking drink my piss  and then someone tells me  that if you drink your piss  it's really good for you  and Machida did it  and then I found out  from one of my fight trainers  that he drinks it  in the morning.  So I pissed into a cup  in the morning  and fucking once again  for ellismania.com  drank my warm piss  with a head on it. 
[03:47:00]  Nice and funny.  That's what I did.  That's what I did.  You can't hold it in.  If you're going to drink  your own piss  you don't do  the morning fucking piss  because that's all  that's dark yellow shit.  Once again  once again  I thought  who in radio  because Liam Machida  is the light heavyweight  champion of the world  who in radio  is drinking their own piss?  I will drink my own piss  to be the greatest  radio person in life.  Every morning  I'll get up  and I'll drink my piss  to be the champ.  Fucking change my mind.  It's supposed to be  good for the complexion. 
[03:47:30]  Complexion.  Complexion.  I didn't slobber on that.  No.  Don't turn on me.  I'm not fucking Pharrell.  What I'm saying is  look  Ant's got the problem  with Pharrell.  I didn't turn on Pharrell.  I listened to what he had to say  and I gave a shake it up  and we went our own ways.  What can I tell you?  I can't fight the world  every day.  It's getting exhausting.  You gotta let some  of these battles go.  He said some nasty  asshole things.  Ant's not over it yet though.  I ain't fucking over it.  I probably won't get over it.  I don't think he's worth  it getting over. 
[03:48:00]  He's not the kind of guy  that I'm like  I could give a shit  if I'm fucking friends  with Pharrell.  Hey can we talk about  my band and my fight  instead of burying  my fucking friends  you fucking asshole.  Can you at least do it  when I'm not on the air anymore  you fucking brick.  So you're putting him  in a bad spot.  But you're not in a bad spot  because I already taught you  and you're not listening.  It's a bad cop  good cop thing happening.  Oh okay.  Well then hey man  stop it.  Yeah you let Anthony  do that  knowing that you don't agree  and I don't agree  and then everyone's safe. 
[03:48:30]  I understand you.  Alright.  Can we look  Ellismania.com  and Ticketmaster  to go see  fucking  Ellismania 4  October 5th  sponsored by Chad Reed.  Yeah that's pretty cool.  Ellismania.com  take it in.  You fucking asshole.  God  I fucking hate you.  Fucking coming to New York  and fucking kicking  your leg with you.

Hey, Jason, fuck you.  Telephone Tum Guy.  Who ate my half a sub? Who ate my half a sub?  Telephone Tum Guy's gonna make me laugh  all day. Oh, you're so lucky  I don't have a fucking memory, you fucking  old bitch. 
[03:51:30]  We might have to trade for that one. We might have  to give up one of our old bits so we can start using  that one. I like Telephone Tum Guy.  That's really good.  Fucking testicle sack annihilating  What do you got on Paris Hilton? Let's make some  worldwide news. What do you got on Paris?  She's a racist. She's a racist?  Alright. Why do you say that?  It's just my opinion. Just to  think I didn't like her at first.  Hey, Tully, why can't  you come in here and say that she's all this  shit and I'll be like, dude, you don't really know that.  You know what's terrible about her? 
[03:52:00]  Those fucking feet. She's got  hard looking feet. She's an excellent  swimmer right here. Fergie.  Fuck it. I was watching those commercials.  Fergie's face looks like a fucking cheeseburger.  She looks like a fucking shaved  pug.  I like to cut my own cock off and  consecutive knee strike her in the face for like  two days. Fucking bush pig.  I'm kidding. I'm sure she's a great person.  She has those long fucking  talon toes. It's disgusting.  How do you know what her toes look like? 
[03:52:30]  Because there's been a commercial every two  seconds during the fucking Yankee games  and she's laying there and they  they kind of pan the camera down to her feet.  Oh, boss. Stop it.  Showing his feet.  And it looks like she's got fingers on her feet.  It's disgusting.  Are you looking at her feet when you're  banging her in the face?  I don't know, but you know they're down  there, you know, even if you're just fucking  her, she's a gun too far.  Right when you're, you know, if you're  banging her and stuff, you grab on her ass  and you're just like, I know those toes are  down there.  Oh, shit.  Man feet.  One thing I like about Jason Ellis' show, he  encourages women to take loads on their 
[03:53:00]  faces.  So that's for them and for the men as  well.  I try to make the world go around.  Listen, remember you made fun of all  I like a load on my face.  Shake it up.  Take your dick and shake it up in front  of me.  Shake it up.  Ticketmaster.com to Ellis Mania, October  24th.  Taint stick.  There'll be fucking big B's, swollen  members, fucking Everlast.  I'm going to knock them out of TV.  Fuck you.  Fuck everybody.  Fuck old people.  I'm surprised your mouth still works,  you geriatric fucking testicle sack. 
[03:53:30]  Wait.  Fuck you, Red Dragons.  Hold on.  Before we do that for you.  Jason, you still there?  No, he's gone.  Yes, I am.  You have to take one phone call.  Remember when you made fun of our guy,  Blind Dave, when I said that he had a  fucking ruptured spleen, broken ribs  on the blind boxing?  Blind and a pussy?  Yeah, yeah.  And you called him a pussy while he  wants it.  He's actually on the phone.  Blind pussy.  He's on the phone.  Blind Dave, you're talking to Jason  Ellis.  Yeah, wouldn't a pussy have tapped out of  the fight?  I mean, I finished the fight.  I stayed for the rest of the show. 
[03:54:00]  So how does that make me a fucking pussy?  I got punched in his part.  Because your innards are weak,  just like your eyes.  They don't work,  neither do your insides.  I see I'm going to punch you in the  fucking head and make you deaf as well.  And then you won't be able to enjoy me  or this fucking shit old testicle sack  radio show.  You fucking douchebag.  I love you, dude.  I'm just playing with your emotions.  I find you motherfuck your boss  and you wonder why you're still  fucking broke.  Go back to fuck you.  Hey, you're never going to be able

Get your plug out.  Ticket master.  A lot of telephone tough guys today.  A lot of tough guys.  Jason, does your roommate have  anything to plug?  Yeah, like a bunch of hot bitches  every night, asshole.  I'm just asking.  Benji Madden, good Charlotte.  I don't give a fuck.  Whatever.  Right on.  Jason Ellis, cool.

Are you in LA?  Yeah, mate.  I'm going to be there in December.  I'm coming to the studio.  That sounds terrifying. 
[03:55:30]  Do a show.  Huh?  Yeah, do my show.  Show the karate ball.  He's fucking funny, man.  He'll just punch the shit out of you.  Was he a karate guy?  Are you a comedian?  Yeah.  He would kick your ass.  Sorry, I didn't get it in the last half an hour.  So gandily, right?  Well, how could you?  How could you?  You didn't let anybody talk.  You got any plugs?  You want what you guys usually do?  No, I don't give a fuck about plugs.  My show's already sold out.  I'm not begging for fans.  He trains MMA.  Oh, he does?  Yeah.  He's a karate guy.  He's a little of everything guy.  He's a karate guy.  How old are you, dude? 
[03:56:00]  Is this whole new thing coming?  Karate, dude.  He's a karate man.  You're a karate man.  Master joy.  I trained under YBJ.  I trained to be a ninja.  You want to throw a kick?  No, not to this guy.  He's a karate guy.  He's going to let you do it for free.  Don't you get it?  He's not fucking going to hit you back because he doesn't think he has shit.  I'll throw a reverse roundhouse and break his fucking jaw.  I will fucking throw a reverse roundhouse, break your jaw, so your fucking roommate has  to fucking liquid feed you. 
[03:56:30]  Test to feed you.  I moved out tonight.  Last night was my last night.  Oh, really?  I went to a millionaire restaurant, got a steak dinner and all kinds of stuff.  No blowjob, but it was still good.  All right, Chase, we got to go.  Yeah, we're out of show.  Yeah, follow me on Twitter as well.  There's my last fucking bullshit plug.  Jay Ellis, mate.  I follow you on Twitter.  I know you do.  Fucking goddamn fucking Anthony.  You know the guy that follows me.  Well, I guess I got a lot of people that I follow.  I guess I'll take one off.  Maybe I'll take off and shake it in. 
[03:57:00]  So are you, motherfuckers.  Thank you.  Thank you for the opportunity, you piss-fucks.  All right, there goes Jason Ellis.  Thanks, Jason.  Fucking cunt.  Is he fucking tough?  Is he a tough guy?  He would kill you.  He's a murderer, right?  He would kill you.  He sounds like.  No, he's the real deal.  He would kill you.  You fucking let Fedor kick him.  I don't even care if Fedor kicked you half his strength.  That's fucking terrifying.  You're done.  Yeah.  And how did, and also he went from fighting. 
[03:57:30]  Is he still fighting for money and stuff?  Or he's still.  Does a little of everything.  He was, uh, what was his big thing?  Was he BMX or skateboarder?  I fucking forgot.  Like everything.  Hold on.  What, uh, pro skater.  Right.  Okay.  Tony Hawk and shit.  And then he hosted the X Games for a while.  Now he's trying to make a run at radio.  He's been doing it for like, I don't know, maybe two years now.  He does well.  He's, uh, he's off to a good start.  He doesn't talk enough.  That's his problem.  Jesus.  It's tough.  It's tough to keep on track.  Fucking meth.  Maybe.  He's done that type of thing too, I believe. 
[03:58:00]  Rich, uh, thank you.  Helium Comedy Club this weekend.  Starting tomorrow, right?  Thursday, Friday, Saturday?  Yeah.  Hope, uh, the Phillies win today.  And that opens it up for people who are going to see you.  I think they're going to win tonight too.  And then you got, uh, Rich Voss on Twitter and, uh, and whatnot.

[03:58:30]  How old's your girl?  What's that?  The little one.  What about her?  How old is she?  Two.  Ask her.  Ask her.  She would know.  She probably would know.  Yeah.  Really?  You don't know how to send pictures on Twitter.  You don't fucking know how to follow people on Twitter, but you're part of it.  And you just got an iPhone and you, and you discover you don't need your laptop anymore.  I got the iPhone two fucking days ago.  You know, I got...  I came in here to...  Anthony's up to his tenth iPhone.  You're a little behind.  Really?  You're a pisser. 
[03:59:00]  How do you twit Twitter?  No, I know how to twit.  I'm just saying, what do you, like, fucking...  If I want to tell people...  No, I got Twitter.  I just want people to go, how do we follow you?  Will I say, Rich Voss?  When you have a name...  Do you read the replies?  I don't want to say it because I'm scared it might be a password.  What I'm trying to say is...  What I'm trying to say is...  He's not lying either.  He's not fucking just...  He's not lying.  He's not lying.  That's the best part.  When people...  When you read replies on your Twitter...  Yeah.  You click on that name... 
[03:59:30]  Yeah.  ...and then you'll see their page, and there'll be an option to just click follow.  I don't want to follow them.  I want people to follow me.  Well, that...  You got to fucking work at that shit.  We just gave out your Twitter, so maybe you get a few followers.  How do you give it out?  What do you say?  Rich Voss?  And that's how they follow you?  Don't...  Isn't there an address?  I don't have time for this shit.  There's no fucking address?  I don't have fucking time for this shit.  Well, you're helping...  You're helping a fellow person.  I don't have time for this shit.  Some of the stuff we talk about off-air.  It's like teaching a retard calculus.  Yeah, Rich.  What are we doing here?  It can't work.  Who the fuck wants to learn calculus? 
[04:00:00]  Good point.  Good point.  Exactly.  One of Rana Fez's interns just brought a dead body to work.  What is that?  That should be a good show coming up.  Wow.  There's a dead body in that fucking rug or something, whatever he's carrying.  He just had it over his shoulder.  Forensic files.  Thank you, Rich.  She's high.  She's high.  I'm a party club, Philly.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  We're out.  Bye.  That's some good lines. </pre>
