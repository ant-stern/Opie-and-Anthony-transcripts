<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a pre-show hosted by Sam Roberts.  He discussed the recent snowstorm, previewed the upcoming guests – DJ Who Kid, Ron Bennington, Bobo, and Lexi Love – and highlighted a listener's attempt to synchronize "I Saw the Sign Girl" with the Ace of Base song.  The pre-show also featured humorous audio clips, discussions about acrophobia, a heated exchange with a caller critical of the show's visual content, a revisit of a "Bad Guest Day" segment featuring an author of a scratch-and-sniff wine book, commentary on Jim Norton's perceived softening, and a discussion about inappropriate parental behavior in youth sports and schools.  Bobo's sudden surge in Twitter followers (likely purchased) was also mentioned.

The main show opened with a discussion of a pregnant woman killed in a snowplow accident, transitioning into a debate about C-sections versus vaginal births and a vulgar tangent about a "Caligula" remake casting. The conversation then shifted to the high cost of college, internships in radio, the changing landscape of radio, and the hosts' experiences, including their firing for the "Sex for Sam" incident. A lengthy segment followed on classic rock bands, their longevity, personnel changes (specifically mentioning Styx, Foreigner, Supertramp, Bad Company, the Allman Brothers, and Journey), and the cynical business strategies behind replacing original members. Ron Bennington was a guest in the studio, along with a caller, Jerry from Reno, who provided information on Styx's touring schedule.  The hosts also discussed planned segments, including a Valentine's Day edition of the dating game.  A sexually explicit voicemail was played.

Further segments included discussions about including disabled children in school sports (with one host recounting an anecdote about hitting an autistic child), Ron Bennington's new radio show "Raw Dog," Philadelphia comedians, anecdotes about Fez, the hosts' personal and professional lives, Ozzy Osbourne's reality show, healthy eating habits, and a critique of the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue.  Ron Bennington remained a guest in the studio.  The show heavily promoted the upcoming "Dating Game" segment featuring Lexi Love.

The "Dating Game" segment began with a graphic sexual monologue by one of the hosts, followed by Jim Jefferies's "Masturbation Memories" story.  Further sexually explicit calls and messages followed.  DJ Who Kid, a guest DJ, was interviewed about his international travel and earnings.  The dating game itself saw three bachelors – Bobo, Oscar, and Denny – vying for Lexi Love's attention.  Bobo revealed he was a virgin. Oscar detailed a shoulder-biting fetish and his preferred sexual position.  Ron Bennington discussed his numerous penis surgeries.  Lexi Love ultimately chose a date.  Numerous commercials aired throughout this segment.

A second "Dating Game" segment highlighted Oscar's sexual preferences, Bobo's voice fetish, and Denny's unexpected departure (later explained as a technical issue at SiriusXM).  The segment included questions about age differences in relationships, uncomfortable jokes about underage sex, impromptu poems for Lexi Love, and an awkward musical performance by Oscar. Lexi Love chose Oscar as the winner.  Post-dating game, a discussion ensued about Denny's personal life, marital status, condom usage, and a digression about a former athlete's alleged sexual exploits in multiple cities.  Bobo expressed frustration at losing the dating game.

A subsequent segment featured a heated argument between Bobo and other members of the show, including Opie, over Bobo's perceived self-centeredness and excessive talking.  Phez Watley's silence was also criticized.  A caller, David in Israel, discussed the market for selling credit card points.  The argument was interspersed with discussions of celebrity gossip (Kevin Hart, Bruce Jenner), and the lack of compensation for college athletes.  Highly offensive language was used throughout. The segment concluded with more advertisements and a post-show segment featuring Who Kid recounting a night out with Wiz Khalifa. Bobo's stolen MP3 player was also a recurring topic. The show ended with the hosts expressing affection and thanking the guests.  Finally, a block of commercials aired, promoting various franchise opportunities, a joint supplement, and a web filter.

[00:01:00]  Welcome, welcome, and good morning.  Big Friday show.  It's the ONA pre-show.  We are live, baby.  No snowpocalypse is going to stop this train from rolling through.  Counting down the minutes before the beginning of today's big Opie and Anthony show.  Go ahead and call us up.  The phone lines are open.  Start your morning with the Opie and Anthony pre-show.  866-WOW-1-WOW. 
[00:01:30]  866-969-1969.  Jump on the phones and talk about what might be coming up today.  Opie was tweeting a lot.  If you were checking everybody associated with the show,  everybody's Twitters last night,  a lot of clues as to what might be happening today.  Looks very, very exciting for today's show.  Of course, we can talk about what happened yesterday.  Because if we don't learn from history, we are doomed to repeat it.  And a whole lot more. 
[00:02:00]  But 866-WOW-1-WOW is the phone number to call.  Of course, the story everywhere is still the weather.  Here in New York, we got a little more snow last night.  Everything is going to be fine.  It's going to be sunny again.  But in Atlanta, I guess they're still piecing the puzzle pieces back together.  They're trying to rebuild the city.  And apparently right now looks like it looked during the first season of The Walking Dead.  But the highways just have cars in them with no people.  I don't know how they're getting by.  But I hope if you're in the areas affected, that you're surviving. 
[00:02:30]  And you've still got your SiriusXM, so you can enjoy this show.  And then today's Opie and Anthony show.  I talked about what was going on on Twitter last night.  Big announcements from Opie.  On today's show, as per Opie's Twitter account,  DJ Who Kid stops by.  DJ Who Kid, not on the post show.  Well, he might be on the post show.  But also on the main show, DJ Who Kid, 
[00:03:00]  on the Opie and Anthony show today.  And, and,  Opie made this announcement on Opie Radio on Twitter last night.  For the first time since leaving the Opie and Anthony channel,  the first time in 2014,  Ron Bennington returns to the Opie and Anthony channel,  returns to the Opie and Anthony show.  Ronnie B from the Ron and Fez show will be on the Opie and Anthony show today.  So it is going to be a wild show. 
[00:03:30]  Of course,  also on Opie's Twitter last night,  he posted,  we set out a challenge yesterday  for one of our listeners  to sync up Ace of Bases'  I Saw the Sign  with our own  I Saw the Sign Girl.  We played that a little bit yesterday.  Let's,  let's listen to  how it went down on the show yesterday  and how this whole thing started.  Because right now on Opie's Twitter,  there is a video  that was made 
[00:04:00]  syncing up these two songs.  Let's hear how it played out on the air.  You got it on pause where you are?  No,  I'm going to start it over.  What?  No.  I need some lyric.  You,  you go to the first I Saw the Sign.  Okay.  Travis,  please.  And then,  Sam,  you find the first I Saw the Sign.  And then at least we can...  Is my computer on?  Yes.  And then both kill yourselves.  Okay.  All right.  Hold on.  No,  no,  Travis,  stop it.  No,  wait,  no.  You're right, 
[00:04:30]  but stop,  Sam,  you got to...  Sinking stuff is so fucking frustrating.  No,  no,  no,  you're letting it go.  Right,  boom.  Perfect.  All right,  wait.  No.  No,  stop it.  All right,  there it is.  It stopped at I.  Okay,  so who stopped at I?  I did.  Travis,  all right.  Now,  are you stopped at the first I?  Now,  you got to go back.  It opens up my eyes all the time. 
[00:05:00]  Life is demanding without understanding.  I'm so fine.  It opens up my eyes.  It's so cool.  No one's gonna drag you up.  This is so visual.  To get into the lights where you belong.  It'll work though.  It's awful.  I just got to hear us singing.  I, 
[00:05:30]  I got a new game.  There's any fears of wanting who you are.  I'm a new person like you.  Baby,  you're a new member.  She must hate this.  Where I see a lot of stars.  So you can hear that it kept going and going.  You can hear us all laughing in the background because it really is.  And go to Opie's Twitter account or YouTube account,  Opie Radio at some point today. 
[00:06:00]  If you want to see how the video looks synced up.  Because that's what we were laughing at.  Playing her version.  That's Pamela.  I believe her name was Pamela.  Years ago when we were on K-Rock in New York,  we did a MacBook karaoke contest where everybody just emailed in their favorite karaoke songs and them singing it.  And I remember I was put in charge of going through all these emails.  And we got email after email of just people singing songs.  And they were kind of just non-remarkable. 
[00:06:30]  And that's not something you can put on the air.  But I remember getting Pamela's email.  And I remember just sitting there with my laptop going email after email and hearing that song.  And sometimes when you go through entry after entry for any audio contest,  it starts to skew what you think is good and bad because you're a loopy.  But when that email came through, I said,  Holy shit, this is a game changer.  And that song has survived.  You can hear us laughing.  That's why we were playing it because it was so funny, 
[00:07:00]  synced up with Ace of Base's original song.  It was a very visual show at points yesterday.  We started the show.  And it was a terrible way to start the morning.  I talked about this a little bit on the post show.  Just a terrible way to start the main show yesterday with videos of people in high places.  I always get nervous and I get anxiety.  It's these like Russian guys who have no fear about climbing up these ridiculous structures. 
[00:07:30]  For me, it's like once they get to the top, how the hell are they going to get back down?  But I mean, there's videos of them doing pull-ups on I-beams, hundreds of feet above forests.  You can see the tops of trees hundreds of feet below them.  But we found a couple videos.  One was, I guess, a couple kids climbed to the top of the second highest tower in the world in Shanghai.  And another one with base jumping.  It was giving me major anxiety. 
[00:08:00]  But this is how yesterday's show kind of started.  That's Trek 2.  Oh, he's on the ladder.  And it's the second tallest building to begin with.  With this crane on top of it.  We just felt like doing that, so we did it.  You did not.  The crane has to be a couple, what, at least 100 feet?  Oh, yeah, man.  At least.  More than that is probably easy.  They're still climbing.  This gives me major anxiety.  Yeah, this one was not fun to watch yesterday.  Wow.  There's still a lot more to go.  Yeah.  Now they're climbing way more carefully because they're getting to the top of this crane. 
[00:08:30]  I would just, my body would just tell me that this crane's going to tip over because I'm in it.  And then how do you?  Then I would panic because you have to get back down.  You have to get down.  Right.  You'd have to jump.  You'd have to just die.  Yes, you'd have to just die.  Oh, the wind, I'd be afraid of being blown out between the little metal things.  Oh.  And then he's just looking down through the middle of the crane, and that looks like it's forever.  And now the guy's just climbing the side of this pulley thing. 
[00:09:00]  It's like he gets slim.  Holding on tight.  It's a helmet cam, which is scary because everything looks rounded.  Right.  It's on his dick.  It's on his dick.  Fat helmet.  Oh, they're just enjoying the hell out of it like it's no big deal.  Well, where are they going?  It's almost done.  They have to go back down.  Yes, they do.  It's almost done.  I don't like this.  Oh, they go outside.  Oh, look, there's another climb thing.  That's helpful.  A little platform out there.  He's got to go on the outside.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Now he's at the tip.  That is the tippy top of the crane. 
[00:09:30]  I bet you that they're not supposed to be there.  He's standing on.  He's just standing on the top of it.  There's nothing holding him.  He's not holding on.  That's high.  I'm going to high five.  Don't high five.  You're going to fall.  Don't high five.  Look at him.  Love those jumpers.  They're very high.  Isn't that unbelievable?  Yeah, we would just like, fuck it.  No, that wasn't you.  It was unbelievable, though.  It was terrifying.  This is the ONA pre-show.  We're live. 
[00:10:00]  Call us up.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  866-969-1969.  Call up right now and start your morning with us.  We had a helpful caller yesterday.  After we were doing all this visual stuff, somebody kind of called us out and said,  Guys, you're a radio show, and I personally loved the way ONA responded to him.  Let's play that.  Let's say hi to Brad in Ohio.  Brad.  Brad.  Hey, I got a question for you guys.  Sure, we'll have answers. 
[00:10:30]  Yes, Brad.  Do you realize you are on the radio and we can't see these videos?  Yeah, we're doing this for ourselves, and you're being extremely nosy.  You're rude.  Exactly.  Mind your beeswax.  Mind your business.  Don't you worry about what we do.  Yeah, stop trying to get in.  I think you forgot the whole part where people are listening.  No, we don't care, actually.  We were doing that for ourselves because it's pretty amazing to watch.  Pretty cool.  Because we were voted show that relays messages best to the listeners' ears.  Four years in a row, yes. 
[00:11:00]  Four years.  Nice.  Yes.  Is it eaves or eavesdropping?  Eaves.  Eaves.  You're eavesdropping, sir.  Yeah.  That's not polite.  Yes.  Stop eavesdropping.  Eavesdropping is what happens when you pick up E-Rock.  You just drop it with eaves.  All right, boy.  All right.  All right.  Go watch it yourself.  Exactly.  This has been a long haul for us, so guess what?  We're going to do some things for ourselves from time to time.  We're turning you on to these videos.  That's right.  Yeah. 
[00:11:30]  I love that.  That's the craziest shit I ever heard in my life.  Somebody calls up and says,  I'm a listener, and you're doing visual things on the radio.  You're here to entertain me.  And Opie accused him of eavesdropping.  He's like,  We're trying to have a conversation, sir.  Please stop listening to us.  You're trying to get people to listen to you.  It's a radio show.  But God damn.  866-WOW1-WOW.  It's the pre-show.  And we start our calls today with Snowy in Michigan.  What's up, buddy?  Samuel, how are you doing today, sir?  Good. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, I'm with you, man.  I am bad with heights, and those videos make me queasy.  Yeah.  I saw a video on Tosh for a while ago about some guys, some gushing kids jumping out of  some sort of tower, base jumping.  And the guy's chute did not open.  What?  The guy survived it according to the breakdown and everything else.  But you just see him go down, down, down, up, and the poof of snow is coming up.  It's almost like you don't want to see that because the whole idea, the reason that you're  scared watching that anyway is the fact that it could happen.  Seeing it actually happen will make me not want to go to the second floor anymore. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, you have to check it out, but I'm bad with heights, and it's goofy.  The guy says, how do you get queasy watching a video on a computer screen?  It's easy because I'm nervous for those guys.  I'm like, what are you doing?  I mean, and it's not something that you can predict.  Like, I don't expect to get nervous watching those things.  But when we took the show to Chicago a year or two ago, we brought the whole show to Chicago,  and we went up to the Sears Tower, and we stood in those clear plastic boxes at the 
[00:13:00]  top of it, and I thought, yeah, I thought that was going to be easy for me because I  was like, logically, I was like, it's just a, it's a, it's a clear plastic box.  Kids run around in this thing all the time.  It never falls down.  But I stepped out into that thing, and the minute I did, I turned into jelly.  Yeah, I hear you, man.  I mean, I couldn't do that myself.  I don't care if you talk.  You know, it's impossible to break.  I don't, you know, I don't want to be that one person.  Oh, damn, that's too bad, you know?  Yeah, it's crazy. 
[00:13:30]  Thanks, Snowy.  All right, man.  Let's go to Peter.  Peter on Long Island.  Welcome to the pre-show.  Damn, the next big thing.  What's up, buddy?  What's up, buddy?  How you doing?  Good, good.  I'm actually an elevator mechanic here in the real world, and you do get used to the  heights after a while.  Is that right?  Like, because I see, I see guys up, like, on top of the George Washington Bridge at, you  know, 4.30 in the morning, with cables on them connected to it, but they're just hanging  off the GW Bridge, where people go to jump off and kill themselves just to fix stuff. 
[00:14:00]  And they don't have a care in the world.  Cars are whizzing by them.  They're moments, inches away from death at any time, and they really couldn't be bothered  less.  Well, it's the weirdest thing.  Supposedly, public speaking is the number one fear.  That's bullshit.  So maybe those guys would look at your career and panic.  Who knows?  Dude, all you...  I actually did the...  I did maintenance on the two elevators inside the Throgs Neck Bridge towers. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  And that was...  Again, I don't love heights.  I don't think any person does.  But it's part of a job.  You get used to it.  The guys should do it for fun.  I wouldn't climb in Russia.  Blows my mind.  Yeah, thanks, Peter.  Blows my mind.  And it's one of those things, like I said, it sneaks up on you.  I remember going to Hershey Park.  And I was like, Jess, we went late.  And so most of the rides were closed.  And I said, we should go on that little, you know, ski lift gondola thing that you just  sit in and it slowly takes you around the park. 
[00:15:00]  Every theme park or zoo has them.  And I was like, yeah, it'll be easy.  It's slow.  It's fun.  There's no line for it.  And I got up on that thing.  And I swear to you, it was five minutes of sheer panic.  I'd never felt like that.  I was looking straight forward the whole time.  I couldn't talk to her.  I was clutching whatever I could clutch.  It was so embarrassing.  And Jess was just like my wife, swinging her feet off the thing like, oh, look.  Look at the coaster over there.  Look how big that M&M is. 
[00:15:30]  This is amazing.  And I was like, oh, please make it stop.  Please.  Andrew in Jersey, what's up, buddy?  Hey, what's up, Sam?  I'm definitely afraid of heights, too.  A couple of years ago, I had these guys working on my roof, putting on a new roof.  So they asked me to go up because they wanted to show me what they were doing.  So I go up the ladder.  It's no big deal.  Once I get up on the roof, I freeze and I can't get off.  That's what I was thinking.  Like, once you climb up that high, I would just sit there going, well, I've done it.  But there's no way I'm getting down. 
[00:16:00]  So all these, like, Mexicans.  I know a little Spanish, so they're talking about me, you know, call me a faggot and everything.  So they almost had to call the fire department.  Like a cat stuck in a tree?  Yeah.  So I actually, one of the guys had to go in the house, go into the attic, open up the window,  and I had to climb through the attic.  And you don't...  Yeah, my cock between my legs.  Yeah, definitely.  Just shriveled up.  And you don't know until you're up there that you're going to be scared.  No, I knew I was going to be scared.  Thanks, Andrew.  Bye.  I'll talk to you later. 
[00:16:30]  We had the return of something big.  I told you today's show is going to be big.  As I said, Opie already tweeted out that Ron Bennington and DJ Who Kid would be on the  Opie and Anthony show today.  Yesterday, we had the return of Bad Guest Day.  It hasn't happened, I think, in over a year.  I don't remember the last time we did Bad Guest Day.  But we had an author call in to talk about his scratch and sniff wine book.  And there were a couple moments that I wanted to share for that. 
[00:17:00]  Here's the first one.  What is his...  What's the name of the book?  Oh, no.  Let me see here.  The name of the book.  It's The Essential Scratch and Sniff Guide to Becoming a Wine Expert.  Do you think it's going to work for you?  It's working for him. 
[00:17:30]  Are you almost done reading it over there?  Absorbent pages.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  It stinks.  Not the book, sir.  There's an aroma wafting up here that is not in your scratch and sniff book.  Yeah.  There we go.  Richard, you want to take some questions?  It's so uncomfortable. 
[00:18:00]  It is so uncomfortable when they do stuff like that.  But I love the fact that even though Anthony gets so uncomfortable, he refuses to leave the moment.  And Opie just swims in it.  Opie just loves every second of it.  But the callers got involved yesterday, too.  And this was definitely my favorite call of yesterday's show.  All right.  Let me.  All right.  Let's.  I'm just.  You know what?  For some reason, we don't know what they're going to ask, unfortunately. 
[00:18:30]  So let's just start from the top.  All right.  We'll go.  I see it's Jason, though.  Jason and Akron.  Jason, what's going on?  You're on with Richard Betts, who has a fantastic wine book.  Hi, Richard.  I was wondering if you double as the leprechaun for the Denver Broncos.  No, you know, I don't.  It sounds like a fun thing to do, though.  Oh.  Oh, it's very fun.  Why would you say that, Jason?  He sounds gay.  What?  Whoa. 
[00:19:00]  Well, I don't even think.  Are leprechauns gay?  I don't think anybody's sexuality has any bearing on anything in this situation, sir.  Liking wine doesn't make you gay, sir.  I'm personally offended by that phone call.  Richard, I'm sorry.  Don't worry about it.  Sorry, Richard.  Obviously, the story you.  It's all right if you're gay.  Yeah, the story you told about you and your buddy drinking wine and coming up with the book. 
[00:19:30]  We don't care about your lifestyle.  That's fine.  Right.  That's fine by us.  Absolutely.  I appreciate your consideration.  All right.  Then they did the help.  No, it's fine if you are.  Don't worry about it.  Sometimes the best route to take is just literal and direct, and that was proven by that caller  yesterday.  866-WOW1-WOW if you want to call the pre-show.  We did take a major something away from that bad guest day beyond it just being a funny segment.  We were talking earlier this week on the pre-show about the fact that Jim Norton watches 90-Day Fiancee 
[00:20:00]  now, and he just likes the characters.  Like, he's softening.  Then he went into this whole thing about how soft he was becoming.  He was admitting it.  But listen, let's go to track 10, Sal, and listen to Jim's reaction following yesterday's  bad guest day.  He's gone.  Probably drinking wine.  That went okay. 
[00:20:30]  That was nice.  I realize as that's happening that I've just softened with age.  Yeah.  I can't be mean to people like I used to be.  Aw, Jimmy.  That's adorable.  But no, it's not a moral judgment.  It's not like I'm a gang.  It's just, ah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I cringe too fast now.  Yeah.  Aw.  Aw.  Menopause.  You know what it is?  I think it is.  Menopause.  I hear ya.  Yeah.  Eh, he's a nice enough guy. 
[00:21:00]  I don't think any of us can be.  Just with a dream and a book of 10 pages.  Yeah.  Who's had a fun book?  You think, you think, you think Opie, you think Opie put the point across that his book  was too short?  You think?  Yeah.  This from the guy who created the Ramon phone call.  I mean, we all know Ramon phone calls by now.  That was Jim.  What I think is very interesting about Jim's new perspective is that it doesn't apply once 
[00:21:30]  he gets upset.  Like he said, he doesn't, he doesn't, he can't be mean to people anymore if they haven't done  anything to rile him up.  But put that clip in perspective with this clip.  Let's go to track five, Sal.  And listen to, uh, this is, we watched a clip of a kid who punched a bus driver, right?  And then the bus driver hit him back and the bus ended up slamming into some cars. 
[00:22:00]  The mother of the kid that initially punched the bus driver wants to press charges against  the driver.  And this was the feedback on it.  Why did the mother want to, you know, that's just, that, he, that worthless thing fell out  of your cunt, lady.  It's your fault.  Yeah.  You're shitty at what you do.  Right.  You raised a fucking animal.  Yeah.  It's that fucking, that dumpster between your legs.  Drop that little fucking monster out who punched a bus driver in the face. 
[00:22:30]  Punches a bunch.  Sue yourself.  Could you imagine the kid, like if a kid punched the bus driver in the face when we  were going to school, he would, first of all, he'd be a legend.  Like, like that would be one of those stories that would be told years and years.  Of course.  Uh, no one did that shit.  But the kid's pretty brave because that, the bus driver's an animal.  He's a big motherfucker.  Big motherfucker.  So he's pretty brave on his part.  He's probably, he's not brave.  There's no thought process that goes into this kind of violence.  There's no sort of consequence.  It's the moment.  It's that fucking moment where it's like, I have to hit someone. 
[00:23:00]  I have to walk up and punch that person in the face because they disrespected me.  So put that in perspective with everything.  Make sure the context is clear.  Maybe Jim isn't softening.  He's just becoming a multifaceted person.  In the sense that if he thinks somebody's a nice guy, he doesn't really want to make  fun of him anymore.  But, if he thinks somebody's doing the wrong thing, he will refer to it as a, what do you 
[00:23:30]  say, a monster that fell out of your cunt?  A dumpster.  Dumpster.  Jesus Christ.  866-WOW1-WOW if you want to call the pre-show.  Now we were talking about looking at Twitter last night and everything that is going to  be happening on today's Opie and Anthony show.  Of course, DJ Who Kid and Ron Bennington in studio as per Opie's Twitter account on the  O&A show today.  Also, if you were checking all the Twitter accounts associated with the Opie and Anthony 
[00:24:00]  show, which I suggest you do, or at least just follow O&A show on Twitter, you would  have found out that not only do we have Bobo coming in studio today.  Yes, a week after the Super Show, Bobo coming back on the O&A show.  But Lexi Love, the penthouse girl who was in that Bobo is just obsessed with, will also  be here.  Now the interesting thing about Bobo is I was getting tweets last night and somehow Bobo 
[00:24:30]  went from about 4,000 Twitter followers to 57,000 Twitter followers overnight.  Yes, I believe that he is unaware that somebody bought him like 55,000 Twitter followers.  And if you go to his Twitter account, you can see that he's like a celebrity all of a sudden.  He has more Twitter followers than almost anybody on the show, other than Opie, Anthony, Jim, 
[00:25:00]  and myself.  But yeah, all of a sudden, and he's arguing with people on Twitter that Twitter followers  cannot be purchased, and that every one of those people is just a big Bobo fan, that  apparently the Bobo thing just exploded overnight.  Sal is looking at his Twitter followers, and they almost all, none of them have profile pictures.  They're all fake accounts.  So we'll see, we'll see how that goes today when we confront him on that issue.  So, Ralph on Long Island, welcome to the pre-show. 
[00:25:30]  Hey, I just want to tell you kind of what you guys were talking about earlier about that  bus driver getting punched in the face.  Yeah.  Like, I coach youth sports, like youth girls team basketball.  And I'm telling you right now, I see more times where the girls are like sneaking out  and meeting boys or posting pictures like that they shouldn't be posting online.  And then the friend who, like, tells their parents, hey, this is going on, you know,  and the parents get involved.  And then the parents get mad at the kids for telling on them instead of getting mad at the  kids for doing the shit.  The parents are getting mad at kids for telling? 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, they're like, why did you tell your mom that, you know, on my kid that she was  posting pictures online?  So the parents are getting mad at the kids?  Like, the other parents are getting mad at the kids?  Yeah, they're getting mad at the kids.  Like, why are you telling on my kid?  That's ridiculous.  It is insane every day.  Oh, my God.  Like, I don't even understand how there could be adults that would confront a child and get  mad at him.  Like, hey, we're intellectual equals here. 
[00:26:30]  Why the fuck would you do that?  And the kid's like, I don't know, because I'm a kid and I felt like I was getting bullied.  Yeah.  And then they go so far and it's just like, I mean, you guys talk about it every day.  And every day I'm just like, dude, this is the life.  To where, you know, you can't say anything anymore to a kid and they're like,  oh, you've kind of worked hard on my kid at practice.  I'm like, what are you talking about?  The real world is going to be hard on your kid.  It's so weird.  Yeah.  Thanks, Ralph.  It's the same thing we were talking about with Valentine's Day.  Of course, today is Valentine's Day.  So we will. 
[00:27:00]  And we were talking about it earlier this week that kids can't bring in Valentine's for the  people they like anymore in some schools.  We read a note from a school that on the air earlier this week, which will play on the O&A  Best Of and it's on demand at SiriusXM.com, that they can't bring in Valentine's just for  the girls or guys that they like anymore.  They have to bring it in for the whole class.  But, yeah, it's loopy.  It's nuts.  Let's go to Scott in Minneapolis.  What's up, Scott? 
[00:27:30]  Hey, Sam, Robert.  How are you doing today?  Good, buddy.  Appreciate it.  I just want to tell you, I think you're doing a good job.  And I'll be staring at you tonight from your apartment.  Well, thank you.  Thank you very much.  I appreciate that.  I bet you got a big old dick.  I do.  I do.  I'm glad you predicted that.  You're exactly right, Scott.  Thank you.  Can you tweet some photos of it for us?  No, I will not be doing that.  But I appreciate that you're making mental images of it.  I assure you, it's enormous.  Today, one of the topics that they're going to get into, yesterday we got into rap music. 
[00:28:00]  And that's uncommon for the Opie and Anthony show.  It doesn't happen every day.  Today, Drake is all over the news because he's like one of the biggest rappers out right now.  And he was tweeting Rolling Stone that he was pissed off because they were supposed to put him on the cover.  And instead, they put dead Philip Seymour Hoffman on the cover.  So Drake is saying, I never would have done the interview if I knew you weren't going to put me on the cover.  And Rolling Stone is saying, relax, Drake.  Philip Seymour Hoffman died of a heroin overdose. 
[00:28:30]  We didn't see it coming.  I'm sure ONA are going to get into that today.  But we got into 2 Chainz yesterday.  It was one of my favorite things we've done in a while.  Here's the guys talking about 2 Chainz music video.  Is there any rap song just about other things other than how great you are?  We get it.  Bitches, how great you are.  The girls like you.  We get it at the party.  You're the best.  What is this?  This is fucking awesome.  Will you explain this to the people?  Well, see, there's men in suits. 
[00:29:00]  Right.  And they're sitting in the backyard in a line of chairs.  All getting lap dances.  And then there's a guy barbecuing.  Ignoring everything, wearing a cow shirt.  Right, he's worried about his steak getting burned.  And the garage is totally smoked out.  Oh, this fucking asshole.  And then Yeezy comes out.  His name's Kanye.  Oh, that's stupid.  He's riding a bicycle.  You go downstairs and fall asleep with the TV now.  Y'all been together 10 years.  You deserve a menage. 
[00:29:30]  Jesse, if you put...  What is he driving?  He's driving a bicycle with a giant cake with boobies on it.  It's a giant cake he's towing with a bicycle with titties all over it.  Yes.  While this chick's trying to eat herself out on the sidewalk.  What's going on in these videos?  In front of a whole bunch of little kids that are flipping the birds.  That are flipping the birds.  Right.  I just can't understand.  I cannot fathom.  After that description, like me hearing that, even though that's me talking to Opie and Anthony about that video, 
[00:30:00]  all I want to do is, what's that video?  I've got to see it.  How do you not respect?  Once Kanye West comes out driving a bicycle with a giant cake with boobies all over it attached to it,  it's like, yeah, I'm down.  This is cool.  Whatever this is, it's very cool.  Well, you know what's cool?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Ron Bennington in studio today.  DJ Hookid in studio today.  Bobo in studio today.  Lexi Love in studio today.  And I have a few surprises up my sleeve.  I didn't want to let the cat out of the bag. 
[00:30:30]  But I have a special guest coming in for Opie today.  I hope he makes it in through the weather.  Sal came in today and he goes, I made it, but there was a puddle outside my house.  He literally said that.  He's like, Sal, okay, step over the puddle and don't tell me the story.  I don't need your biography.  Well, guests abound on exciting Friday Opie and Anthony Show.  Starts right now.  We'll be right back. 
[00:31:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:31:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:32:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:32:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:33:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:33:30]  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back. 
[00:34:00]  I'm up early in the morning.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back. 
[00:34:30]  We'll be right back.  Turn my headphones up.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back. 
[00:35:00]  Oh yeah, on the edge of your chair, cause you really wanna hear, Opie Anthony and Jimmy, just keep it right here.  It's the Opie Anthony Show, yeah, the Opie Anthony Show, yeah, it's the Opie Anthony Show, yeah.  It's the Opie Anthony Show, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, 50, yeah, now Mike Tyson up in the pit, it's the Opie Anthony Show, booga booga, booga booga.  Enough of this platter, let's get this show on the road. 
[00:35:30]  Yuck, good morning everyone, it's Opie Anthony time, sans Anthony.  He has a problem with his teeth.  Did he really?  Yeah, he went yesterday.  What happened, man?  They replaced his, they took his teeth out and the ones didn't fit, the new ones, so they replaced them with genital warts and it's not happening. 
[00:36:00]  Anthony's not at all happy with his new genital warts.  Fucking Ron Bennington, walking in like a superstar, doesn't even have to try.  I missed the longest opening song in the history of radio.  I know, what are you gonna do?  You know how it is, Ron.  Oh.  You squeeze an extra four or five minutes, you know the deal.  I like the goatee.  Well, you know, it's a winter thing.  Is it?  You know what I mean?  It's a winter thing.  It's like, maybe when spring hits, I'll save it, but not until. 
[00:36:30]  That is a sweet goatee, brother.  You gotta fight back a little bit.  Right.  You gotta fight back against this winter.  And no one's gonna fuck with you.  You look evil.  Well.  Is this the evil Ron Bennington?  Don't you just think that Ron Bennington himself is the evil Ron Bennington?  Well, I'm onto you.  I don't think a lot of people are onto you.  I'm onto you.  No.  I've been onto you for many years, brother.  He's sweet.  I've been onto you for a while.  But now the goatee.  That's like that sitcom stuff. 
[00:37:00]  Make the character evil by going the goatee.  Well, you gotta turn it a little bit.  You know what I mean?  I like to stay in character.  Yeah.  You know, speaking of evil, I think that your show has taken more of an evil bent since  you gave power.  I like that.  To Sam.  Sam's got some power out here.  He's an evil fuck.  It's really despicable.  It really is.  Yeah.  Because he doesn't have emotions.  We like hiring people that don't have emotions around here.  This is Sam's angle. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  What can we do to special needs people?  I wonder where he learned that from.  Awkward.  I just had to tap out of that stuff years ago.  Sure.  I had to.  But I know.  But now it's back in a big, big way.  Yeah, but I don't have to, you know.  You don't have to partake in it?  I don't have to.  I don't have the responsibility.  Right.  He's the Malcolm McDowell, and he's Caligula.  But basically, you're Tiberius Caesar.  Right.  There you go. 
[00:38:00]  And the listeners, I'm sure, get those references.  You'd be surprised how many people see that as the best porn ever made.  Yeah.  I think it's the most expensive porn ever made, right?  Without a doubt, yeah.  And it wasn't supposed to be a porn at first, right?  No, I think Peter O'Toole, McDowell, Helen Mirren, none of them knew it was a porn.  They would come back at night shooting the hardcore sex scenes.  Yeah, they thought it was just going to be a hardcore R.  Yeah, just a really rough R movie about Caligula Caesar.  How embarrassing.  Then all of a sudden, they slap it with that X.  You know what?  Why not look at your check and see the name Guccione is on there, though? 
[00:38:30]  Good point.  What are you fucking thinking?  Good point.  That guy, you know, this is the funny thing about us.  We forget our own history, American history.  But Guccione is the guy who goes, you know what?  I want to see a little pubic hair out there.  That was his genius.  And everybody was like, holy shit.  Right.  This is fucking brilliant.  So instead of the hand down being in front of it and just saying tits and ass, you pull 
[00:39:00]  that hand back.  And he was able to buy like a double townhouse in the Upper East Side, which now would be  worth like, I don't know, $8,500, $100 million.  Easily.  And just turned it into a giant fuck pad.  Right.  Where is that place?  It's up on the Upper East Side.  Damn, I can't think of it.  I think it's like the low 70s or something.  Yeah, it takes seconds, Sam.  If you're not, you know.  It takes seconds, Sam.  Get off of helpus.com. 
[00:39:30]  Fucking weather's brutal out there.  This is a weird winter, huh?  It is.  It's a sleepy winter, isn't it?  I haven't been outside in weeks.  I was outside once before the Super Bowl.  I took a bike ride.  But besides that, I'm an outside guy.  I have to be out wandering.  Fuck yeah.  I hate this apartment living in New York.  Well, that's where your kids are.  Well, yeah, but I'll take them with me.  I'm good.  I'm good that way.  But you can't take a kid around in this snow? 
[00:40:00]  No, kids hate to play in the snow.  I mean, just to do basic shit.  What do you do with the kids?  How do you have fun with them?  You have to play catch?  No catch yet.  No.  A little sledding during the winter.  But the problem is, kids, they have ADD.  So I could hang for an hour and a half and kill an hour and a half.  He's done after 10 minutes.  It's like, all right, now what?  I'm like, what do you mean, now what?  This is what it is.  We're going to stay here for a while. 
[00:40:30]  This is everything.  If you could get a three-year-old to focus for more than 15 minutes, you're doing something  right.  Does he watch any sports yet?  No, not really.  No.  A lot of cartoons.  A lot of Spongebob.  A lot of Adventure Time.  Yeah.  Which is kind of a stoner.  Well, they're all kind of stoner if you think about all cartoons.  Adventure Time is definitely a stoner cartoon.  He loves it.  Like, that cartoon network has just turned into Adult Swim.  Right.  I think almost around the clock.  Right.  Yeah.  You get a little buzz going and you turn that on. 
[00:41:00]  You're all right.  Can you guys watch cartoon movies now as an adult?  Fuck yeah.  That's all I do.  I can't do it.  Why?  Did you go see Frost?  Well, why would you?  Is it Frozen?  Frozen.  I mean, I keep calling it Frost for some reason.  Frozen.  I had to because I did this.  I did an Unmasked with Josh Gad, right?  Okay.  So I had to go to see the movie.  I'm in a screening room.  Right.  And like, I'm not even kidding.  Three minutes into it.  Yeah.  I just go, oh.  Really?  It just was pain.  Like these.  Yeah. 
[00:41:30]  It's just painful to me.  I shut my brain off.  I'm good.  I can do it.  It took like an hour and a half before even the funny character showed up.  Josh was hilarious in that movie.  Yeah, he was great.  But there was two serious girls.  Right.  For like 45 minutes.  And why does every one of those movies have to start with some ridiculously over-the-top tragic event?  Isn't that horrifying for little kids?  Yeah, I think.  You always have to have some kind of horrible death.  It's a dead parent.  Mostly they go death parent, right?  Yeah. 
[00:42:00]  What's the reason for that?  A dead parent, I mean.  What's the reason for that?  I don't know.  I would like to know.  I don't like to get out of a fucking thing.  Like, you're not safe.  You know what I mean?  I think the whole point of being a kid is waiting for your parents to die.  Oh, that's wonderful.  You know what I mean?  Like, then this is your time.  Right.  You know?  Right.  I can't watch them either.  I don't hate them, but I don't find them.  I'm trying to think of the last cartoon movie that I actually enjoyed.  I watched them.  I'm like, ugh.  Really?  Yeah, I just can't.  No, and they look so good now.  I can easily sit through them. 
[00:42:30]  Easily.  And I know when I'm watching a bad one.  Really?  Yeah.  You know the difference?  Yes.  All right, so what is a good one and what is a bad one?  I don't know.  And I mean the big one.  Like, is Up good or bad?  That was okay.  Up was horrendous because it was so deeply depressing that she can't have children.  See, I didn't even go to that.  The fuck?  I didn't go to that.  I was out of that one.  Up was brutal.  The last one I saw was like Jeff Garland was a fat baby taking care of a robot on another planet. 
[00:43:00]  I don't know the name of it, but everybody loved it.  Oh, Wally.  Okay, Wally.  The first half of Wally is horrible because it's all just one color.  I like when they got on the spaceship.  Then it got cool.  Here's the weird thing.  I went into this with, you know, these other people.  It was 10 o'clock at night, right?  So the kids were asleep.  Yeah.  And the fucking theater was packed.  Yeah.  And then going crazy as if it was a stone shell.  Really? 
[00:43:30]  People were just fucking screaming and high-fiving.  And I was just in pain.  People love cartoons, man.  They love cartoons.  I like the old shit.  I can watch old stuff, but new stuff I can't watch.  What's the old shit to you like?  Bug Bunny.  Yeah, I could too.  Felix the Cat.  You know what?  I don't know if I like Felix.  I would watch it over something new.  Right.  The old school was a little meaner.  The guns in the face.  Right.  They've taken all the barbarism out of these, and that's kind of what I enjoyed about them.  Well, with Netflix, my son will pick, you know, what he wants to check out.  And he grabbed Felix the Cat for a while, and he was all in. 
[00:44:00]  And then you watch that and realize that it was completely horrendous.  There was nothing going on in that dumb little cartoon.  A magic bag!  It was dumb.  Try to turn him on to some Top Cat.  Top Cat.  Because that was like fucking street guys.  Really?  Yeah.  Gotta go Top Cat.  That was like New York street guys that were cats.  Yeah.  Can you get old, like, Warner Brothers and stuff on Netflix?  I think you get everything, right?  Yeah, pretty much.  Yeah, he also does Scooby-Doo.  That's smart.  And then they have a brand new Casper the Friendly Ghost. 
[00:44:30]  Like, they redid that.  And it looks really strange.  But that's kind of creepy when I look at that shit, because I'm like, those are all like dead kids.  Yeah, it's a dead, it's almost like a dead toddler.  Yeah.  And someone brought this up, I don't remember, but they said it looked like Richie Rich died.  That's about right.  That same massive head.  That's about right.  What was the, there was one movie we had to turn off, because it was all about dead paranormal or para... 
[00:45:00]  Sixth Sense?  No, no, it was a cartoon, the para...  Paranorman, was it?  Thanks, Travis.  He knows.  Yeah, that one was like, I realized, okay, this is too much for the kid.  Paranorman?  Yeah, everyone's dead in the movie.  Oh, okay.  The kid sees dead people.  So I guess his name's Norman or whatever, yeah.  That's great.  That's a great little angle they pulled down.  Horrendous, dude.  Fucking horrendous.  If you've got kids, you've got to watch them.  I mean, if I had children, you have to find cartoons that are entertaining, or you're going to just have an hour and a half after hour and a half of misery. 
[00:45:30]  I wish they would have a cartoon come out every week, it would be great, because you could kill two or three hours in a movie theater with these young kids.  But the kids want to watch the same cartoon over and over.  Right.  They don't want to watch a bunch of cartoons.  They want to watch the same cartoon that they can then say the words along with, like Rocky Horror.  No, it's Despicable Me 2 right now, and it's Clyde with a Chance of Meatballs 2, over and over and over again.  Imagine if you get hooked on Upstairs, Downstairs, or just some other weird adult show, some odd British sitcom. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, God.  Every day, the same exact movie in the car.  Well, you know, you've got to remind yourself, that's not a babysitter.  Okay?  That's not a babysitter.  It's easy, though.  Sometimes you're like, you know what?  Get a little lazy, and you put a movie on.  Right.  And then later he'll think, I don't feel good.  Where's my joint?  Right.  Because I think that is, like, the same thing.  Like, let me have comfort.  Right.  Now, the weird thing is, now that kids watch cartoons in the back seat, right, they'll never 
[00:46:30]  know where their house is.  They're just walking around, I don't know, somewhere near Despicable Me Avenue.  You're kind of right, because if you don't turn the TV on, you could see a three-and-a-half-year-old  jonesing.  He's jonesing already.  He is jonesing.  He doesn't understand, you know, riding in a car without that fucking movie on in the  back.  That would have made me sick when I was a kid.  No, we use...  That would have made me vomit. 
[00:47:00]  Honestly, we use it for the opposite effect.  If he's focused on the TV, then he doesn't puke.  Well, is the TV up or down?  You just looked up.  Is the TV up or is it...  Slightly up.  But, I mean, he's small, so it's...  It's like on the headrest.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So it's slightly up.  I don't know if that would make me sick of that.  But it keeps him focused, so he doesn't puke.  Did you get carsick?  Horribly so.  Dude.  I still do.  If I'm in the backseat, I still...  If I face the wrong way, I'll vomit.  Really?  Like in a limo?  Oh, limo side seat?  Yeah.  Can't do it.  No.  Look at us talking about limos.  I haven't been in a limo in years, but I'm just saying. 
[00:47:30]  I hate limos.  And a stretch limo.  Is it a stretch limo?  Even when we were being offered a lot of limos, I didn't take them.  I hated them.  Unless I had the backseat looking forward.  So we went a little different in Florida.  We just filled it up with fucking titty dancers.  Good for you, brother.  I didn't care what fucking angle we were in.  I have to face forward all the time where I get sick.  On a plane, I can't...  Not that you have options on a plane, but didn't Southwest used to have options of facing  different ways?  Yeah. 
[00:48:00]  I remember once flying across the country backwards, and it just felt weird.  I felt like I was hurtling backwards.  You get to look at everyone, though.  Well, you have to put a magazine up.  Because you can't just stare at people for five hours.  Yeah, like a security guard on LL, just fucking staring back at everybody.  On a train, that's the first thing I ask when we get on Penn Station.  It's like, which way is it?  Making sure that we're not going to be pulled backwards.  I can handle being pulled backwards on a train.  I can do that.  But when we were at N.E.W., when we used to get the wrestlers on, Bubba Ray Dudley was 
[00:48:30]  in.  Yeah.  And he's a Long Island guy.  And he goes, hey, you want to ride home?  And I go, great.  And it was a limo.  And I was on the side seat.  And right off the L.I.E. on the service road, where he was dropping me off, as soon as I  got out, a fucking puke.  Really?  I was so sick.  Who was facing forward besides him?  Of course he was.  It was his car.  You didn't want to sit next to him like a couple of days?  There was somebody else.  I don't even remember who else was in the car.  I would say, do you mind if I face forward or drop puke? 
[00:49:00]  But I was sick the entire time.  I couldn't wait for that fucking thing to stop.  And I just lost it on the side of the road.  You know what makes me sick sometimes?  And Kenny does this.  Is Kenny such a fucking meat and potatoes guy?  It's forward, stop.  Forward, stop.  There's no gentle easing.  It's black or it's white.  We're driving.  We're not.  We're driving.  We're not.  It's that.  And whenever Kenny stops, there's always that stop, forward back.  That little lunge back.  And that makes me want to puke terribly. 
[00:49:30]  That's his brain.  Yeah, exactly.  That's his brain.  That's how he's thinking.  He just goes forward.  Just big Frankenstein foot.  Driving.  We're not.  It stops.  And then you rock.  And it's making me want to fucking puke.  You're like a mouse riding in his pocket.  Yeah, Kenny.  Mr. Jangles is going to get really sick on you if you don't fucking slow down.  He's amazing, Kenny.  That's why he does his job so well.  This is a fucking queasy show, though, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  So hold on to it.  It's a great description.  This is a queasy show.  My fucking throat hurts today. 
[00:50:00]  I think it's the air.  The dry air.  It's hot as piss in here.  Is it?  Yeah.  Let's turn that down, Sal.  Is it warming here?  Yeah.  Turn it all the way down.  Let's cool off a little bit.  Have a cold ease.  I was a little sick of the day.  I took a nice cold ease.  I'm telling you.  They fucking knock you cold right out.  I don't feel sick.  I just, I don't know.  I think it's just the dry air.  And I'm working out at a new gym.  And I found out the boss works out there.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  You guys working out together, spotting each other?  No, no, no, no.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  We don't want to talk about the locker room.  We'll just practice our benching with no weights. 
[00:50:30]  You guys throw the medicine ball.  At the Indian clubs, y'all.  At the old school, fucking.  Me and Jimmy laugh at the weirdos.  We do, we're at the same gym.  Yeah.  And we laugh at the weirdos.  We got some really strange fucking guys in our locker room.  There's one guy, and he's always nude.  Ronnie would appreciate this one.  He's always nude.  He's an old guy.  He's a champion exhibitionist.  Right.  He has a micro penis, too.  He has a micro penis and a giant bag.  And the black guy that works in the locker room always talks to him.  It's a very weird relationship. 
[00:51:00]  Like, I'm dying to get the dynamics of this down, because, like, he'll just stand there  naked, and they'll be talking basketball.  But he's naked.  Like, you'll go to the shower and come out, and he's still naked talking to this young,  fat black dude.  It's really fucking creepy.  I've been there when the guy has arrived, and he can't get naked fast enough so he can  start his conversation with the black guy that works in the locker room.  Yeah.  It is the weirdest fucking thing ever.  And then there's a creepy guy who looks like Alan Arkin, who's always, I think he's  like a fucking bag checker.  He's always looking at his phone, and I always think he's trying to film.  He creeps me out, that guy.  He sits in a chair right next to the bathrooms and the showers and stuff, because there's 
[00:51:30]  a TV kind of in that area.  And he just acts like, oh no, I'm just hanging out here.  On my phone.  He's on his phone.  I'm like, is he fucking filming?  Right.  I'll see a fucking video of you guys.  That would be hilarious.  Honey, come in here.  Look at Opie.  Right.  It just grosses me out.  Yeah.  Fucking some of the people in there are creepy.  Is this an Upper West Side place?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a nice place, but like, I don't know, man.  It's weird. 
[00:52:00]  Why is the Boston?  I think it's, no, this is another place.  I'm going to like a rehab place to get my shoulder and my back back in working order.  I thought maybe there were celebrities.  Well, Jimmy Fallon works out there, and Mayor Bloomberg.  Ex-Mayor Bloomberg.  True.  I wish he was still the mayor at this point.  De Blasio is.  Mayor for life.  No, I like having a fucked up mayor.  Do you?  Just to balance it out.  Yeah, just to have conversations on the street.  I think you've got to balance it out.  You know what I mean?  Like, what the fuck?  I just love that.  I think it's going to be great for our radio show. 
[00:52:30]  This De Blasio.  Oh, well, it keeps Anthony nice.  Yeah.  Well, he shut down the school.  He didn't shut down the schools yesterday, so there's a big controversy.  And then him and Al Roker were going at it.  Right.  He's answering Al Roker's tweets.  The mayor.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It got pretty ugly out there on Twitter yesterday.  But, see, most people don't realize this, that if they shut down the schools, there's  a lot of kids that got nowhere to go that day. 
[00:53:00]  And that's the only food a lot of these kids get.  See, a lot of the kids, their dad isn't a fucking weatherman for the today show.  So if it snows and you don't want your kid to go in, just don't fucking send them.  Right.  Yeah, that'll be up to you.  I actually agree with the mayor on this one, because I get it.  You know, it's different than when we were growing up, where you had a parent home all  the time, so if it was a snow day, who gave a fuck, everyone was happy.  Well, maybe the moms weren't happy, because they now had to deal with us, but...  It's not like there's school...  But we don't have it anymore. 
[00:53:30]  You know what I mean?  They're taking a fucking train or whatever.  Someone said that it was...  Because it seemed weird.  Someone said it was a federal funding issue.  Like, for days you take off, you don't get federal money.  Yeah, that's true, too.  But I agree.  If you don't want to send your kid, don't send them.  But they rarely shut down the school, so they've got plenty of snow days.  But you don't realize how many kids get their food at school.  It's even why they want to start this other program with, like, babies.  Because there's kids out there that don't have food, and they have, like, a crack mom,  and they can get to them and say, like, here's some carrots. 
[00:54:00]  Right.  You know?  Yeah.  Because the parents got to scramble to get daycare, babysitters, because they can't  just blow off their job, because their kid's home from school.  That's true, too.  So I kind of agree with the mayor on this one.  And they're blaming him because a fucking pregnant woman got killed by a snowpuff?  Like, come on.  That could have just been a truck.  Like, some pregnant woman got hit, and she died, and the kid got delivered.  Yeah, what a horrific story.  But they're kind of, like, throwing that on the mayor.  It's like, you can't blame the fucking mayor for that.  She's dead or dying, and they're able to save the baby.  What a horrific scenario. 
[00:54:30]  How does that happen?  We get one of those a year.  There was one in Brooklyn, I think, a couple years back.  Wow.  I mean, it's just the same way that they, you know, a C-section is basically saying  we're cutting the baby out of the mom.  Right.  It's the weirdest fucking thing in the world.  Well, that's looking at it like half, uh, the glass is half empty.  We're saving the pussy.  Is the glass half full?  But I saw this thing on TV the other day to show you how weird Americans are. 
[00:55:00]  It's like, it is okay on TV to show a C-section, but not a vaginal birth.  Right.  You know, like, we're okay with taking a knife, cutting a woman over, and pulling a baby out.  But doing it naturally freaks us out.  We're just such a fucked up society.  We are.  That doesn't make any sense whatsoever.  The fact that you have to lie to Malcolm McDowell, Peter O'Toole, and Helen Mirren to get them  into a porno show, you know how fucked up you are.  They should have seen that entire script and been fine with it. 
[00:55:30]  Do you think that we could do that with Clooney, Julia Roberts?  They just show up, and they find out that there's fucking cock-gugglings.  You know what?  How about they, they're remaking every other movie.  How about they remake Caligula?  That would be a great fucking movie to cast.  With the originals.  Mirren's still around, right?  She is.  He's hanging in there.  Yeah, that's true.  Hold on, I just got a text from Malkovic.  He's in.  He's in, nice.  Can you imagine?  Whatever you want him to do.  Yes.  Willem Dafoe.  I'm doing it. 
[00:56:00]  Can you imagine you get most of them?  We need you to play either Caligula or Cezonia, the sister.  All right, we'll take it.  Who wouldn't watch that movie?  Fuck yeah, dude, in a heartbeat.  We got a guy.  De Blasio said it was an unexcused absence if you missed school.  Oh, wow.  Well, that's kind of bullshit, that part of it, right?  They have to say that, though.  I guess.  It is an unexcused absence.  So what?  My high school was, I just had unexcused absences.  I didn't give a fuck.  I don't know why, you see a lot of these kids, they said the other day, it's more stress  now to be a kid than it is an adult, and I found out it's because they care. 
[00:56:30]  Right.  You know what I mean?  They care about their grades.  I don't know if anyone in my school did.  Not really.  You just want to get through, right?  They smoke these kids on the future in college and all that shit.  College.  Do you believe in college still for most kids?  No.  They're insane.  Right.  Just because of the cost, I'm saying.  It doesn't balance out anymore.  A kid from my high school went to college and it made the fucking newspaper. 
[00:57:00]  Really?  Everybody was talking about it.  The headline is, finally, it's to make a point.  When he got on the train, we were down there with a band.  He was waving goodbye.  I'm off to school, everybody.  But no one talked about it.  No one fucking talked about it.  But just the cost.  I mean, I was in debt up until almost 30 for my schooling, and I didn't go to a crazy  place, but I had to pay for my own college.  Well, these kids now, a lot of them are $200,000 in the hole when they get out. 
[00:57:30]  And you've got to pay that back before you get even and can start making money in your  line of work.  It doesn't make sense to me anymore.  I love that they do that.  They'll go to Syracuse or whatever.  They've got this big nut, and then they come here to be interns, and we have them get us  water.  Oh, God.  I swear that bothers me when we have to send them out for food, because I'm like, they're  probably thinking, you know, come on.  I want to learn something.  I don't want to be a waitress.  Do they learn stuff, too?  They do get like...  They do learn, hopefully. 
[00:58:00]  What does he learn?  Yes, sir.  A lot of the way that a radio show runs.  You know, like the intricacies of...  It's chaos.  You know, prep and all sorts of stuff.  It runs in chaos.  What's the first thing they teach you?  Like, whatever the on-air people don't ask you for, you have to anticipate that they're  going to need it.  Because it's amazing.  Like, I get annoyed if we don't have something that there's no way they could know we need.  There was a murder in Scarborough.  Where's the fucking...  Where's the article?  Yeah, I mean, it's a lot of audio editing, too. 
[00:58:30]  Bringing audio to the show.  And, you know, we do things in a unique way on the ONA show, too.  Yeah, which means it's no good for you to take on to the next show.  Absolutely.  You know what I mean?  Like, no one even wants someone from another show, because they do everything wrong.  And there's not...  There's no shows like our show and your show.  There's none of those.  There's a handful left.  You want to say a handful?  I think it's even less at this point.  What do they do on Terrestrial? 
[00:59:00]  Nothing.  You know, you were saying there was a show in Pittsburgh, didn't you?  Oh, yeah.  Randy's show.  I forget who his partner is, but this guy Randy, there's a DVE, I think, is the station.  Yeah.  You know, he does like a fucking...  It's a hang show.  They're still doing it.  And it's an old, you have like a weird cable-mounted microphone, and you walk in there, and it's  like being on NEW in 2000.  Wow.  Like, it's one of those vibes.  It's just a fucking great hang.  And they do what they have to do break-wise and for the sponsors, but that's one of those  shows you get cowheads like that, fucking Toucher and Richer like that, Chad Dukes for 
[00:59:30]  Sports Junkies.  You get a bunch of shows that still have that feel the best they can under these new, you  know, under the new rules.  Just waiting to get fired for saying something stupid.  Yeah, I mean, and they all walk on eggshells because they know that one wrong move that  there's no way you could see coming.  You never see the fucking bullet that gets you anymore.  Back then, you saw the bullet that was going to get you.  You knew what it was.  Well, that's what happened to us.  With the Sex for Sam, I didn't think we were going to get fired for that. 
[01:00:00]  Right.  Because I understood the culture of radio, but it was changing in front of my eyes, and  I was stupid.  Yeah.  You know?  But in a million years, I didn't think we would get fired for that, just because of the ratings  we had, especially.  We were number one for them up and down the entire East Coast.  I'm like, they ain't firing us?  Boy, was I wrong.  Well, yeah, but that was one that, because it was a sponsored event.  Although, if you step back objectively and say, okay, somebody was arrested, ass-fucking  in a big cathedral, you kind of put that into the check under the fucking fireable offenses. 
[01:00:30]  I completely get it now, but at the time, you know, they just didn't fire radio guys  that were doing well.  They just didn't do it, period.  Unless you fucked up with the FCC.  Right.  And, you know, as we've discussed, ad nauseum, there wasn't an FCC offense at the time.  Randy Bauman, his name is.  Randy, right.  I was an intern.  I didn't learn shit.  I didn't learn shit as an intern.  Is that right?  Yeah, I had a cold call every night and test songs for the radio station.  You were throwing quick hooks. 
[01:01:00]  You were throwing a hook on there.  I was throwing a hook.  I'm like, listen to the...  First of all, it took a hundred calls to get one person that would give a fuck, and  then you had to play, I forget, like ten songs for them, just a hook, and then they  had to rate it.  Wait, what does that mean, what you're saying?  You guys know what that was.  A friend of mine had a business called Quick Hooks.  He would fucking do exactly what it was saying.  He had the business?  Yeah, he fucking ran the...  My PD had the fucking business and was selling it back.  Oh, my God.  He was making some nice money.  And his radio stations and other.  Right.  Kerry Curlop, he's out in Seattle now. 
[01:01:30]  So they would just play the hook of a song to somebody on the phone and go, is this something  you'd want to hear?  One to five or whatever the ratings were.  I forgot now.  Oh, wow.  The interns would get in trouble if we didn't hand in, you know, enough surveys.  So, of course, we all made it up.  We had to.  And because of you, Bon Jovi became a movie.  But that's what's up, like, if you're in your house, the weird thing about that hook 
[01:02:00]  thing is, you're only going to like something that sounds like something you've heard before.  Of course.  You know what I mean?  So it kind of forced rock radio into sounding almost exactly the same, you know?  When I listen to rock radio, there are so many songs out there that they just continue to  play just because they played them for so long.  If you were into a certain era, if you came in...  In the 70s and early 80s.  In the 70s and early 80s.  If you were a band in the late, in the 70s and early 80s and got something on the radio, 
[01:02:30]  they're playing it to this day because of that.  And that just doesn't happen nowadays.  No.  These songs come and go.  Right.  Like, why is Super Tramp still being played every single day?  Why?  Well, if you think about Super Tramp, and bands that weren't really...  Steely Dan.  ...even big when they were big, like Bad Company.  Oh, right.  It was always, you know, like Super Tramp, just below being big.  Right.  But they could still go out and tour today. 
[01:03:00]  Because of the exposure they got.  Yeah.  And they get it to this day.  You listen to any one of these rock stations, they're still playing that stuff.  Well, George Thurgood has had four songs or something played his whole life.  Right.  And he still tours 250, I mean, he still outdraws...  Right.  ...kids that have had massive hits...  Right.  ...in the last 10 years.  Isn't that amazing?  Yeah.  Just because of that exposure they got.  Yeah.  Get a haircut and get it.  Get a new job.  Get a new job.  Yeah, he's the worst.  Same exact riff on every song. 
[01:03:30]  And yet, he, his career, you would not trade.  Right.  You know what I mean?  There's like so many people that would go, I would love to have anything near that.  There's so many soundtracks and stuff, too, have used his shit, too.  Once you're in a tremendous amount of movies...  What are you looking at, Sal?  His tour dates.  Oh, his tour dates.  Wow.  Wait, are they...  What kind of places, though?  Oh, he stays on the road, man.  Wow.  Is he squeezing out smaller venues these days?  House of Blues.  House of Blues, you know.  Yeah.  He's doing a lot of House of Blues.  He's doing a show every other night. 
[01:04:00]  Wow.  Yeah, one on, one on.  This is 30 years later.  Yeah, 30 years later.  He hit in the early 80s, probably.  And those guys from the 90s have to tour with like three of them now, going out and playing  an amphitheater that used to sell out.  Well, the first thing I want to say is, I got to defend George Thurgood.  Have you ever seen him?  Oh, yeah.  He puts on a damn good show.  Dude, he's like from my own neighborhood.  He really does.  Is he really?  He's a Philly guy?  He's Delaware, right?  Oh, right over the border.  Sure.  So he used to play a lot of bars down there. 
[01:04:30]  And everybody, you know, you go out, you see an old fashioned rock and roll show.  Right.  Have a great time.  But, you know, those, those 90s bands can't really fucking sell anything today.  One or two of them, maybe.  And it's really, now anyone coming up, you basically know this is a hobby.  You're not even going to make a living out of being a musician.  No, you might get a year or two and that's it.  So make your money quick.  Well, the other day on TV, oh, actually, I think they were up here. 
[01:05:00]  They called it a merger of bands.  It's Foreigner, Styx, members of Foreigner, members of Styx, and Donald Fagan thrown together.  They're touring.  Donald Fagan's?  Yeah.  And they're calling it a merger.  They were up here.  I don't know who talked to them.  Who was in Styx?  Was it Tommy Shaw?  Dennis DeYoung?  It was Tommy.  Dennis is out.  Yeah, it was Tommy Shaw, the new guy from Foreigner that really could, you know, sing those songs perfectly.  I forget his name.  Wait, is he the one that we Ramoned?  Well, we might have. 
[01:05:30]  We might have.  Who was actually, because he had a weird name.  We might have.  I can't fucking remember what his name was, the singer.  Yeah.  It was a girl's name.  Oh.  I forget, to be honest.  Not Terry.  If Sal was good on the Google, we would know this by now.  Oh, Sal, what are you doing?  What the fuck?  Why are you looking up Donald Fagan?  We moved on from him.  I was Googling the, what was the name?  Thank you.  Kelly Hanson.  Kelly Hanson.  That's right.  I just remembered that, Travis.  Thank you.  He could pull off the Foreigner song.  Yes.  Yeah, exactly.  Why'd you say Dennis DeYoung is out like you knew that? 
[01:06:00]  Like, is he away from the band?  They had a big breakup, and he was out, and he was the songwriter and lead singer, but  they thought he got too pussy.  Remember the whole Dami Omagato?  I happen to like that song.  I fucking turned on him after that.  But it has nothing to do with the stick sound.  Right?  Maybe not.  Yeah, that's true.  And Tommy Shaw was in here, and he told us how much he fucking hated that stuff.  Yeah.  But Dennis DeYoung has complete control over that band, and Tommy Shaw is just an old-school 
[01:06:30]  rock guy.  Somehow they wrestled it away, though.  Yeah.  The things, it's true of any band, and any fucking radio show, is that you all hate each  other by the end of it.  Even if you hate the Eagles, no, especially if you hate the Eagles, watch the Eagles documentary  that fucking ran on TV.  It was amazing.  It was the greatest fucking truest thing you've ever seen.  You know what?  Where can I see that?  So many people are talking about the damn thing. 
[01:07:00]  It was on like HBO or something for a while.  I'll find it.  I'll find it.  But they were just so honest about money and hating each other.  Right.  Huh.  I gotta check it out.  There it is.  Foreigner Sticks.  Don Felder announced.  Soundtrack of Summer Tour.  Oh, Don Felder.  What did I say?  Fagan.  Oh, Fagan.  I'm sorry.  Don Felder.  Oh, my God.  I'm sorry.  Don Felder.  Well, Felder's a little strange combination as well with those guys.  He shows up in the Eagles thing of they just fucking hated him.  And he wrote the riff to fucking Hotel California. 
[01:07:30]  You can't hate the guy that comes up with the riff for Hotel California.  That's part of why they hated him.  Why?  Because that's probably what he would say in every argument.  Hey, I wrote Hotel California.  Shit.  You're welcome.  So, Dennis DeYoung.  Dennis DeYoung, I guess the story goes he all of a sudden was light sensitive or something.  What?  Oh, I didn't hear that.  Yeah, look it up.  I believe.  He did one of those behind the musics.  And I think all of a sudden he was bothered by light. 
[01:08:00]  And Tommy Shaw and the rest of the guys were like, yes.  Make sure the lights are nice and bright tonight.  We're going to run them out of town.  But Tommy Shaw and them didn't like the whole stage show.  No.  That was it, right?  Dennis DeYoung kind of wanted to go with a little Broadway on them.  Yeah, they hated the song.  I'm right, right?  I think it was Babe.  Remember they had a big hit, Babe?  Yeah, that was my first fucking song that I ever associated with a girl.  It was fucking Babe.  Yeah, they thought it was a song about a pig. 
[01:08:30]  Yes, we're a great baseball player.  Either way, it just didn't resonate.  Sal, go ahead.  Read it, man.  DeYoung said he was afflicted with a chronic fatigue syndrome, like disorder that affected by  trismal nerve.  I don't know what that means.  And he would not be able to perform on stage due to a sensitivity to bright light and sound  caused by this disorder.  Get some fucking sunglasses.  Yeah, bro.  Wear your sunglasses at night.  Wow, I wonder if that was some kind of a weird thing.  Did that, because it was a disability of some sort, enable him to leave? 
[01:09:00]  Did it have anything to do with money, that?  Or is that true?  Like, you know, Americans with disability, you gotta be careful if you fuck with people  who are genuinely sick or have something wrong with them.  Right.  But if he leaves, I mean, he still gets the money for all those old songs anyway.  And I'm sure he would get, you know, part of the touring money.  I was 99, anyway.  Oh, it's been a while, and then he really hasn't done anything since.  But those songs still play.  Those sticks fucking play.  Every fucking day on the rock stations. 
[01:09:30]  Every day.  That's just strange to me.  You would think the rock stations would just fucking throw all that shit out and then take  all the stuff from, I don't know, the early to mid-90s that are now considered classic  rock.  Like, one of the channels on this SiriusXM that I like is Classic Rewind.  Uh-huh.  They'll play, like, the Robber Plant, you know, Heaven Knows, that type of shit, all  that stuff that kind of came out in the mid-90s.  And it sounds cool.  I like it.  The weird thing, we were just talking about little kids wanting the same cartoon over 
[01:10:00]  and over.  Right.  What is wrong with these middle-aged people and still want to hear the same, you know,  Welcome to the Machine, fucking Pink Floyd.  Every day.  Every day.  Why would you want to hear that song every day on your rock station?  Here's my theory.  And Welcome to the Machine would be a good choice, by the way.  We're not talking that one.  We're talking Comfortably Numb every day.  Welcome to the Machine would be a nice little, you know, change.  It's why people ignore technology.  It's because people, nobody, like, you want to feel young.  And you listen to stuff that you listen to for a long time. 
[01:10:30]  And if you start listening to new shit, you feel older and out of touch.  But if you listen to stuff from your youth, you still feel like it's that time period.  Because I always wonder why, if people ignore this technology that comes, like, older people,  like, I don't want to know, whatever, whatever.  And that's what it is.  You don't want to see all the great shit coming up as you're on your way out the door.  And I think part of it is just feeling...  I think it also just brings back memories.  But do you do that...  You know where you were when some of those songs were...  Do you do that with any other art form?  I mean, if...  Not really.  People don't feel like...  Like, people be like, when I was in high school, it was the best fucking music ever. 
[01:11:00]  You find out what music people like is because they were in high school.  Yeah, of course.  But no one will ever be like, we had the best fucking movies ever.  Right, right.  We had Jaws.  Right.  We had Storm, you know.  You don't try...  But even if you go on, like, a YouTube thing, you will see old people in the comments yelling  at young people who show up, like, you weren't even there for this!  Right.  You have no fucking idea how good Asia was!  Thank you!  First Supergroup Asia. 
[01:11:30]  There you go.  We're gonna have them in this fucking studio.  I'm working on it.  I'm gonna try.  Make sure it's real Asia.  I'm gonna try.  I did a gig with them years ago.  They came in and did us, and we were like, they're fucking playing on stage, and we're  off to the side, and I'm like, are any of those guys really in Asia?  No kidding.  That was a long time ago.  Oh, shit.  I'm like, they look pretty young to be in Asia, these fucking guys.  It's always weird when you go and see some of these old classic rock bands, and, like,  the guitarist is 25 years old, and they slowly switch out almost every member. 
[01:12:00]  The Allman Brothers is a good example.  The Allman Brothers is amazing for that.  And I heard a rumor that Warren Haynes and Trucks, they're both retiring after this year.  Well, they're leaving the band, but...  They're leaving the band.  I should have said retiring from the Allman Brothers.  Is that true?  They're leaving?  Yeah, it was in the...  So how the fuck are the Allman Brothers gonna go on?  Well, those guys weren't in the original Allman Brothers at the beginning.  I understand.  So, you know, everybody that likes the Allman Brothers basically likes two and a half albums, 
[01:12:30]  you know?  Like, two albums and a live album.  And they've been fucking touring off those songs forever.  Why are they leaving, both of them leaving at the same time?  It's been a long run.  Yeah.  Greg Allman now, he sings a couple songs, and then he goes and chills.  I had side stage seats once, and, you know, he did a few songs, the place went nuts, and  then he bails for a little while, and...  Takes some...  And Bruce Hornsby, I think it was.  Yeah, it was Bruce Hornsby.  It was all of a sudden Greg Allman for like an hour.  Singing Allman songs. 
[01:13:00]  All that shit.  And then Greg finally comes back.  He's like, all right, I'm ready to do a couple more for everybody.  My liver feels better.  Right.  Let's do this.  Oh, man.  He's got it easy.  Is that what it is, you think?  It's because he's getting older, and he just doesn't want to do it anymore?  Well, yeah.  I mean, he had to do fucking liver and everything, you know.  But Greg Allman's not.  He's not leaving the band.  He's not leaving.  But Warren Haynes is a rock star in his own right.  Sure.  Maybe that's what he wants to do.  He's got to move on with everything else that he's got going on.  Maybe it hurts government mule touring, though. 
[01:13:30]  He's probably tired.  Between doing both.  He's being on the road constantly.  You're in a fucking bus every night.  Does he have a new baby?  Yeah, he's got a kid, too.  That'll change shit, obviously.  That kid thing will change shit.  This guy has info on sticks.  We've got Ron Bennington in studio today.  Jerry in Reno.  What's up, Jerry?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, buddy.  Good.  Hey, I live in Reno, and there's a couple of sticks.  Sticks is going to play at one casino one week with Tommy Shaw, 
[01:14:00]  and then the next week at a different casino is Dennis DeJong  playing the music of sticks at a different casino.  Oh, really?  So Dennis DeJong is...  Yeah.  And you notice he has to call it the music of sticks.  Right, he can't call it sticks.  So he lost out on that battle.  He can't call it sticks officially.  But he's allowed to say the music of.  Believe it, that was probably a huge fucking concession for somebody.  They figured something out.  And that is the truth.  If you own the name, it doesn't matter who. 
[01:14:30]  You know, the name will travel bigger than the band.  Right.  Roger fucking Waters learned that.  No kidding.  Pink Floyd.  What do you mean?  He started playing theaters, and, you know, he wrote all that music.  The band went on without him, and they're still playing, you know,  huge arenas, stadiums, and he's, like, playing smaller venues.  So finally he had to say, like, I'm just calling this The Wall.  Fuck.  You know?  It's called The Wall.  Come see The Wall.  Come see The Wall.  And then people went, oh, okay. 
[01:15:00]  What happened with him?  Because I always, like, whenever I...  Gilmore is the one for me who I prefer of the two.  I mean, even...  What happened to them?  Like, why did they...  Was it just they didn't get along, or did they...  Yeah, I think, like, with most things, you know,  you just can't fucking hang out and travel together.  It's like being in a submarine.  You know what I mean?  Like, it's too much.  Day after day after day.  Day after day.  But, on the other hand...  Day after day after day.  Yeah, it's no one's fucking fault.  I don't want to see your fucking face again. 
[01:15:30]  You're right.  It's no one's fault.  It's no one's fucking fault, but you just fucking...  You just wear each other out after a while.  You're spending too much time with people you're not having sex with.  It's fucking...  It's crazy.  It happens to every band.  Metallica.  Every single band.  Metallica, they don't travel together anymore.  That's the smart thing.  And that's what keeps them probably going.  Spend as much time apart as you possibly can.  When Metallica was coming through here for the Beacon show,  it was four SUVs that pulled up outside. 
[01:16:00]  One for each guy, man.  That's how they do it.  All separate.  That's smart, man.  They probably don't even see each other until they walk on stage, I bet you.  Or maybe if they have to do a meet and greet.  But they're just, like, avoiding each other just to keep it going.  But there's also no such thing as a band that's broken up.  You know?  Right.  Like, when we were younger, we thought bands broke up.  But we've seen enough tours come back.  Because if there's money on the table, I was like, you know what?  I can put up with that asshole another fucking summer. 
[01:16:30]  Fuck it.  Right.  Money's too damn good.  Well, Motley Crue is back on tour, and they're doing this last tour thing.  But I hear they're going to make more on this tour than they've ever made before.  Because they're calling it their last tour.  But the fact is, it's not their last tour.  No one believes that shit anymore.  Yeah.  They'll go away for a year or two, but then there'll be some reason or excuse why.  Well, no, we have to come back.  I know we said we weren't.  And they even know that no one's believing it, so they're signing some contract.  But you know, somehow they'll get around the contract thing eventually.  They'll do a thing where we all came back from McMarr's funeral. 
[01:17:00]  Right.  Something.  Right.  We had to for Mick.  One more time.  Right.  Well, even though, like, I brought up the Eagles did that fucking Cold Day in Hell tour,  or whatever the fuck they called it.  Right.  They said they'd never be.  And they're bigger now.  Than ever.  Than in the 70s.  Mm-hmm.  Because if, as Jimmy was bringing this up, if they play Hotel California, everyone cries  and grabs their balls and remembers some fucking girl that they lost their virginity.  So, there's nothing to do with music. 
[01:17:30]  And more with the fact that people can't let go of their own lives.  The memory.  Like I said, the memories.  Those songs attach it to specific memories.  I remember in the 90s going to see Ozzy on No More Tears.  Whatever that was.  Like, 94, maybe, or 92.  And he was retiring.  And the shirt said, No More Tours.  That was like the tour shirt.  Like, this was the last one.  And then the next or two years later, when he came back, this is the Retirement Sucks tour.  It was such a smart thing.  I didn't know back then that they did that.  But the fact is, if you're a fan of one of these bands, you're not going to bitch if they come back. 
[01:18:00]  Right.  You're not going to be like, hey, asshole, you lied to us.  You're going to be excited as all hell that they decided to continue.  Even if you do bitch, other people are going to go.  Yeah, of course.  You know what I mean?  Or somebody who never had the chance to see them.  Right.  You know?  The fucking Beach Boys are what?  One guy now?  I think so.  I think that's about it.  I've talked about that over the years.  Eventually, these bands will go on with no original members.  And there's a bunch of bands getting very close to that.  Kiss is actually talking about doing it on purpose, right?  Right.  Franchising.  Yeah, he's already figuring out what do we got to do not to be here. 
[01:18:30]  We talked about that concept years ago, that it would be a franchise after a while.  Why not?  Because the people love the song so much and the guys can't do it anymore.  So, as long as you see that fucking logo and the lead singer sounds pretty close, you're in.  Look at Journey.  They reinvented themselves with the Filipino guy.  They basically, and that guy does an impression.  Right.  And the weird thing about him, this is another great documentary you got to do.  I saw that one.  Because it's so cynical. 
[01:19:00]  Amazing.  It's like watching my fucking Donald's documentary.  Right.  That the guy will talk like Steve Perry on stage.  Right.  And then off stage, he's like, it was really great being on tour.  Right, right.  And then he's on and says, great to see you.  Right.  See you.  Cleveland.  Right.  I really am Steve Perry.  Right.  Now, do they have to pay Steve Perry, too?  I'm sure.  I'm sure he gets a taste.  Absolutely.  And Neil Sean just found him on YouTube one night.  He was like, I'm going to continue with this band. 
[01:19:30]  And he just went on YouTube seeing who sounds like Steve Perry.  Found this guy and just out of nowhere called him up.  Well, you saw the documentary.  Yeah.  He was playing these tiny little clubs.  In the Philippines.  In the Philippines.  Imitating everybody.  He does a pretty good Axl Rose.  Oh, right.  We played all this shit.  He's an impressionist.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like having Frank Caliando in your fucking band.  Exactly.  Him and Pat Semerl hooking up.  If I'm dead, that would have worked.  But then they went from playing House of Blues and then with this new kid, they went 
[01:20:00]  back to arenas.  Yeah.  Like massive arenas night after night.  Because people don't really give a fuck, honestly.  Unless you're so attached to the band members.  Most of us are not.  I mean, I'm obsessed with the guys I love.  But most people aren't as obsessed with the average band.  And they just like the music and they want to hear it and, you know, as long as you can  make that song sound pretty close to the original.  That makes me hate those people.  Thank you.  I'm with you.  Because I prefer someone like Jimmy who's like, this is an art form that I care about.  Right.  Not that I'm just going to show up here and treat it like a fucking jukebox. 
[01:20:30]  But most of them are not even, they're not as, most of them aren't in a creative business.  They have fucking kids.  They got to work nine to five and they're just like, I don't give up.  What do I care?  I like, hotel, who sings it?  You or you?  Fuck you.  Right.  I just want to hear the song and go back home.  Well, they don't care.  Using the Journey example, if they came up with a brand new song with the new kid that  was awesome, that got a lot of play, then I would respect them a lot more.  Right.  That's a very good question.  And they're trying to do that.  And that's the problem.  They're trying to do that.  They actually come out with new stuff with the new singer and it's not hitting whatsoever. 
[01:21:00]  No one cares.  You know, and they'll play a couple of them as a throwaway and then go, all right, here,  here, here's lights.  And that's true of the classic rock fucking stations that we're talking about.  Like, you can't put a new Stone song on a classic rock station.  You can't put a Stone song past 1986 or the same people who are listening all day just  fucking turn it off.  Like, this wasn't on when I was in high school.  Right.  It blows.  Do you think Kiss goes into the Hall of Fame with the original four? 
[01:21:30]  They have to.  Because they have so much bad blood.  But with the makeup, it's really weird with Kiss.  They tore in that makeup.  There's something about the visual of that that a lot of people don't.  I prefer the original four, but a lot of people don't care.  I think it would be brutal if they don't go in with the original four.  I think they have to just suck it up and do it that way.  I think you're right.  I hope so.  But it came down to him, I forget which one it is, saying, I'm not wearing the same makeup  as that.  That was Ace Frehley said that he won't play.  He'll play with Tommy, but he won't wear him and Tommy in the same makeup.  Oh, good for him.  What are they, Cats? 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, no, that's Peter and Eric.  He's like the space boy.  No, I think they just do the four original.  That's it.  I think you have to.  I mean, for Gene and Paul, look at it financially.  Because greatest hits albums go fucking crazy when these bands.  That's the advantage financially to go in there.  Everybody goes out and buys your greatest hits stuff.  So they put out a new record of great new packaging and people go out and buy it.  That's the strangest thing, too, that they keep reselling songs for decades. 
[01:22:30]  It's decades.  Like, oh, I'm going to go buy that album again.  I'm going to get the white album one more fucking time.  We all got tricked into buying digitally mastered albums.  What was the difference, really?  You had to have an amazing year to really appreciate that.  But just because it said that, you're like, oh, I've got to have this.  Weird.  Alice in Chains, new singer.  All right, let me go to Chris in Philly.  I have a problem with this one because Lane Staley, I just absolutely loved his fucking voice. 
[01:23:00]  At least him, you can see why they're replaced.  Right.  So many people are trying to turn me out to the new Alice in Chains.  I just don't feel it.  Go ahead, Chris.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, I just wanted to say, look, I'm a diehard Lane Staley fan.  He's my favorite vocalist, singer, songwriter of all time.  But William Duvall kind of has his own thing going, and he does good versions of the Staley  era songs, and I like both their albums, too, with Duvall. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  And I'm a diehard, and any Alice in Chains fan is usually a diehard.  I saw those guys with Robert Duvall.  They're fucking amazing.  I prefer to Michelle.  Yeah, that one I'm not feeling, I've got to be honest with you.  There was something about Lane Staley's voice that I just fucking loved, and the new guy  isn't completely there yet.  All right, Chris, thank you.  This guy wants to chime in about one of our favorite bands, Leonard Skinner.  Skinner Boys.  The Skinner Boys.  Jay.  Morning, Opie.  Morning, Ronnie. 
[01:24:00]  How you doing?  A million bucks.  And Jimmy.  Jim Norton.  What's going on, brother?  I'm sorry.  No, no, no.  That's okay, sir.  I'm just sitting here, just, you know, being sad.  What's up, brother?  Hey, listen, Skinner is a great example of a band that they're carrying on with, like,  almost none of the original members, and they are terrible live now.  Terrible.  You think they're terrible live?  I'm trying to think of the last time I saw Skinner.  What are they, who are they down to at this point in Skinner? 
[01:24:30]  I think one guy.  It is one guy, right?  Rossington or Collins.  Oh, one of those guys?  Yeah.  Is it Rossington or Collins?  I forget.  They sound horrible, though, huh?  Yeah, they're terrible.  They went from playing, you know, arenas to, I think they're playing coffee shops now,  and I'm not sure.  All right.  I don't know what to tell you.  They'll continue it after the last guy's gone, though.  Sure.  That's one of those bands will absolutely continue and then reinvent themselves. 
[01:25:00]  One of the...  Or un-invent themselves.  Un-invent themselves, right.  I remember being in Rochester at Darien Lake around, I want to say, 1990-ish, and I saw Skinner,  and they were amazing.  And what's-his-name was, you know, the brother's singing for him now.  And they did that trick for the first time where they're like, there's only one guy that  can't-can sing this song and he's not here anymore.  And it was Free Bird, but they didn't...  They put the spotlight on the...  On the mic stand.  Yeah.  And I believe they put his hat on the mic stand. 
[01:25:30]  I fucking lost it.  I got to be honest with you.  And then they proceeded to do that for, I don't know, 20 straight years or so.  I was like, okay, we get it.  But how about you start singing the song?  Right.  Right.  Oh, they weren't singing it?  No, they were just playing Free Bird.  It was a dramatic moment.  It was amazing.  And then there would be the empty fucking, you know, microphone.  And then they, you know, everybody in the fucking stands would be trying to sing for  them.  Trying.  That's the key.  You're right.  Trying.  Like, but as far as concert moments go, I can't think of a better one where they, that 
[01:26:00]  was just...  When Paul Stanley would put on the fucking fireman's helmet for Firehouse.  All right.  Well, okay.  That's a close second.  Sure.  I put a Firehouse helmet on.  But yeah, that's a...  What a shit luck thing for a band.  Like, he was so great.  And to have a guy with such a fucking great voice, you know, not that if he had a lousy  voice, they would not have grieved his death.  But, you know, that's a lot of shit luck.  Dwayne Allman, man.  He wasn't supposed to fucking go.  What did he die of?  Motorcycle accident.  He was amazing. 
[01:26:30]  We should take a break.  We got food in front of us.  Ron Bennington in studio today.  We got...  Are we doing the dating game still, Sam?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  For Valentine's Day.  Yes, we are.  And I heard Mike Buschetti tapped out.  Yeah.  He's out today.  7 o'clock, 8 o'clock last night.  Really?  Yeah.  This never used to happen with the old EP.  I know.  He used to fucking run like clockwork around here.  Yeah, he would have been able to, you know, make sure that didn't happen, right?  Don't worry.  I've got a replacement that is better than Mike Buschetti.  I don't think I know who you mean. 
[01:27:00]  Is it a surprise?  It's a surprise.  Well, it is a surprise, obviously.  Famous on the show.  That we haven't seen in a while?  Not in a long time.  I would bet money I know who it is.  Yeah, I already know who it is.  How do you know who it is?  Because Obi and I get...  Obi said it and I was thinking of the exact same person.  And I don't know.  No.  It's a decent get.  It's actually a great last minute scramble.  It's not the guy I would root for, but...  Huh.  Who do you think it is?  I think it's Anthony.  You know what I mean? 
[01:27:30]  Because he's not here now.  He's going to come out a little later.  He's going to go nuts.  I mean, no, Sam doesn't have that kind of power.  I know who it is.  Okay.  If I say it now, you're going to tell me I'm right?  Well, you want me to?  It's your show, right?  Is it since you fucking started EPing?  That's true.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll just keep it as a surprise.  Okay.  Huh.  And then when he comes in, I'll go, yeah, that was the guy.  Yeah, big deal.  We knew.  And Jimmy can back me up because I told him who I think it is. 
[01:28:00]  I just showed him.  I wrote it down.  Me and him come up with the same thing.  Did you?  Oh.  Did he nod along?  What look did he give you?  Fuck, I'm really good at reading people.  I held it up.  I actually didn't look.  Did he look at it?  Yeah.  Fuck!  I would have known just how you looked at that.  Look at that paper again.  It's very...  I already looked at it.  I know what it says.  Yeah, but go ahead and look at it again.  Look at it again.  I'll rewrite it.  Okay.  See if we can see a tell.  All right.  You feel like you're going to read them that well, though, huh?  Well, I would have, if it was original. 
[01:28:30]  See what you just did there?  That was amazing.  Jim wrote the words, fuck you.  Why does it hurt you feeling so bad?  Relax.  The O.P. and Anthony Show will be right back on Sirius XM.

On the way over, we cabbed it and some kid from NYU left his knapsack with all his books and notebooks.  So, you know what?  I'll be a nice guy.  How cool is the guy from Saturday Night Live is going to send him back his books.  Well, this is a thorn in Lars's ass.  For the minute, I get it.  For the minute, I get it.  Dude, what are you doing with the fucking nap?  Get rid of the fuck. 
[01:37:30]  It's ridiculous.  You're like a fag walking around with his fucking knapsack.  So, I'm walking around with this thing.  I said, I'm going to give it back.  Why does the knapsack bother you?  It's fucking stupid.  Fuck that guy.  He's irresponsible.  Fuck him.  He'll teach him a lesson.  He tears the knapsack off my back.  So, what are you doing?  He tosses it across the street, hits some chick in the leg, and it opens up and the bags go all over.  And he's walking down the village going like this.  There's your fucking knapsack, huh? 
[01:38:00]  Are we hanging?  Fuck the knapsack, huh?  Huh?  I'm like, Lars, what are you doing?  Chill out.  And he keeps getting on my face.  Are we hanging or what?  I went, I don't know if I can live up to this.  I talk a great game, but I don't know if I can live up to this status.  Stay tuned for more bedtime stories with Jim Brewer.  Saved message, Sunday, 7.09 p.m.  Hey, it's me.  I don't know what's wrong with me, and why I'm like this, but I want to fucking, I want to fucking go crazy with you.

[01:40:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show is back.  I'm SiriusXL.  Dan, we got Ron Bennington in studio today.  I think Who Dad is coming in today as well, right?  Who Dad?  Oh, is he the surprise guest?  No.  Oh.  Who Kid's not the surprise guest?  No.  All right.  We're gonna do a little Valentine's hack thing today, right?  Yes.  Dating game?  What is it exactly? 
[01:40:30]  It's the dating game.  But everyone canceled, so it's a bust.  No, only Mike Buschetti canceled.  No, and the Vivid Girls.  Mike Buschetti was the fucking key to this.  Right?  You think so?  Yeah.  Mike Buschetti was the key, and the Vivid Girls were the key.  And both are being replaced today.  Bobo?  Yeah, but we just got another girl.  Seriously, again with the Bobo thing?  We're gonna do whatever.  Are we really doing Bobo again today?  Just don't.  Ah, Bobo.  I don't think Ron wants to deal with Bobo.  You're welcome to keep him in the office all day.  That would be fun, actually. 
[01:41:00]  No problem.  I mean, I like the guy, but it's fucking...  What are you gonna do to him?  You throw rocks at him or something?  No, we've already done that.  We gotta come up with new...  He's a person.  New things.  Yeah, but if he...  But if he doesn't realize he's a person, it doesn't matter.  Why don't we do this?  I got a great fucking idea with Bobo.  End of the last two minutes of the game, we put him in, we let him shoot threes.  And we're all locked up on fucking TV at the end of it.  Every fucking night, the news, another retarded kid shooting threes. 
[01:41:30]  They love showing that.  Yeah, but here's what I'm saying.  Fucking get on him.  Put a fucking hand in his face.  Right.  Let's see if he can shoot.  I hear you.  Let the guy fucking play the game.  Well, I agree with you.  When they put the kid in during the football games and they let him all score, look, he  wants to play, fucking tackle him.  Put him in the game and tackle him.  Play him like a human being.  Absolutely, because his life is not going to be horrendous enough. 
[01:42:00]  We should teach him the tough knocks in the first quarter.  All right, but let's do this then.  Why don't they just make him valedictorian?  Exactly.  They'll never act like the academics are easy.  I find that weird.  Maybe because I don't know.  I find it weird when you put the kid in the football game and everyone just lets him score  a touchdown.  That's strange to me.  I think that it's...  But I don't live that way, so I guess maybe it's an amazing moment for that kid.  And maybe that's okay. 
[01:42:30]  I don't know.  It just feels weird to watch.  To me, it's everybody finally being nice.  There's something about him I like.  Like, it gives me...  But can't you be nicer to the kid in another way?  I'm sure people are.  I think they're being nice because they want to be seen as being nice.  Because they all put it on the fucking news and say, aren't we nice?  Now, I did fall for it, and I fell in love with Batman Kid out in San Francisco.  Yeah, Batman Kid was all right.  I love that kid.  Yeah.  But that's everybody play acting.  Right.  A game is real.  Right.  If you think that this kid deserves a shot, put him in the game. 
[01:43:00]  And let him get tackled.  Yeah.  Even if it's them being nice just for the sake of it, which you might be right.  And everybody...  It doesn't matter because the result is he feels really good and his family feels really...  It's like a moment for him that he won't have for the rest of his life.  Let me add this point.  When it happened the first time, not going to lie to you, cool moment.  Problem is, every high school is now doing it.  That's the problem, I think.  And Little League and everything else.  So that's where I'm at.  First time, I thought it was, wow, this is different and kind of cool they did this. 
[01:43:30]  But then everyone has to kind of follow suit and find, you know, their kid in their school.  I used to hate it.  But now, because there are more people doing it, then it kind of grew on me.  I was like, you know what?  I was like, well, fuck this.  I'm like, Jesus, a kid is nothing.  His whole life is going to be filled with not getting shit that other people get.  Most people you meet have never ran for a 90-yard touchdown.  I've never run for one.  I would love to run for a 90-yard touchdown.  But I get to fuck girls.  With no threat of being.  Maybe that would be better to do with the autistic kid. 
[01:44:00]  Give him a blowjob.  Exactly.  Get him jerked off behind the stands.  With no threat of losing my head.  Fuck, I would love to do that.  When I was in Little League, I was pitching and they put the autistic kid in when they were behind.  And I just fucking put one in his ear.  I just fucking said, hey, you want to fucking crowd the plate?  Let's do this.  Look, I put him on base.  Everybody's fucking happy, though.  I put one in his ear.  Because these listeners are fucking assholes.  I'm not saying treat the kid like a dick. 
[01:44:30]  But I think there's other ways to do it, maybe.  It's fucking fake.  That's the thing.  The kid wants a real experience.  Put him in a game.  He's still going to be happy playing the game.  Right.  But now he sees what it's like.  Don't act like he's a subhuman.  Right.  That you have to stop the game for.  But nobody else will feel good about this.  Like, you wouldn't feel good tackling a retarded guy.  You wouldn't.  No player would feel good.  Even the biggest dick wouldn't feel great.  Fucking cutting some retarded or handicapped kid out.  It's like. 
[01:45:00]  Because you know what their life is like in school.  Because if you're saying, like, treat them like everybody else.  That means in the hallway they should kind of get beat up a little bit.  Because we all get smacked.  Well, how about you do it before the game?  While everyone's trying to find their seats.  Right.  And going to the concession stands.  That's a good time to do it.  Then you run for it.  Yeah.  Let them run for it before the game starts.  Is this one of them?  I like to see them.  I like to see them.  This is a good one.  This kid's a burn victim.  What?  No.  Oh, Jesus.  Well, if you find one. 
[01:45:30]  There's hundreds of them now.  I don't know.  I can't see.  Fucking Sam's over there watching TV like he's home.  He's fucked up this whole dating game thing.  Ron Bennington, how is Raw Dog treating you?  Oh, it's really good.  Yeah?  Really good.  The big change is suiting you well?  Well, it's good to get away from you guys.  It's good.  It's freeing for everybody.  We needed a break.  No, it's actually fun.  Yeah?  Good.  Well, the comics like it because they can sleep in.  Right.  When they come in.  Right.  Because you know what they're like when they come in here in the morning. 
[01:46:00]  Right.  And they complain.  I had to hear Colin one time going, and I was like, shut up.  I do it every day.  Yeah.  Fucking hear you got to get up at seven.  Fuck off.  But it is tough because you guys, you know, keep late hours.  I know.  You've been able to figure it out, but you probably get a little extra from them because they've  slept in a bit.  Yeah, they come in or, you know, they've got their shit together and, you know.  Are you doing a comic every day?  Yeah, we're doing it normally around two o'clock.  We'll have at least a comic.  Right.  A lot of great people have been through.  Who do you have in?  I don't know.  I'm sure there's a list somewhere.  I can't remember everybody, but this guy's good and that guy, they're all good. 
[01:46:30]  Who surprised you, though?  Who was better than you thought?  Doing radio, by the way.  I'm not talking about their stand-up.  Well, Big Jay is the guy who's bringing a lot of his buddies in, so right now I'm focusing  on a lot of Philly guys.  Oh, really?  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  They're a unique breed of comics.  They really are.  They really are.  And most of those guys were raised in black clubs.  Right.  So they come at it from a whole different...  Yes.  I'm going to talk to Big Jay, by the way, about his glove and fucking his long thing 
[01:47:00]  in his pocket ensemble.  Yeah.  Well, he's making a statement, I believe.  Which is what?  I don't know.  Back the fuck off.  What is it about...  Fagin.  You know what I mean?  They have kids stealing for him.  You meant Nucky Fagin?  What is it about Philly?  I feel like there are a lot of funny people down there, in general.  I'm not saying these funny people should be on a stage doing stand-up, but I find more 
[01:47:30]  funny people in the Philly area than most cities.  Well, don't you think black people are funny, too?  You never know which one to make the comic.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Because they're outside and they're hanging on the street.  That's how Philly people are.  They're on the street so much that they all have a street attitude.  Right.  You know, they don't come from it from, like, an intellectual point of view.  You know, it's not like that alternative comedy scene where we've thought about something  and we're turning it upside down.  Right, of course. 
[01:48:00]  Just naturally.  Just being naturally funny.  Yeah.  Like, to me, the funniest people are funny even when they're being angry about something  and they're demanding to get their money back and you're just cracking up.  Right, right.  At their fucking displeasure.  Yeah.  Have you seen Mike Epps' stand-up?  Yeah, very funny guy.  Epps is a funny, funny dude, man.  He's just a naturally funny guy.  Right.  Mike, I was watching something he did.  It's like, I think it was called, something be inappropriate behavior as a special. 
[01:48:30]  I was just, like, in the middle.  I just went to the middle of it a few days ago.  I was on my phone watching it at home at, like, 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock.  I had to go to bed and I'm just sitting there watching fucking Mike Epps' stand-up.  Like, this guy's just great.  Yeah, he really is.  You got to come over someday.  I want to.  Yeah.  Will Fez be all right if I come over?  Oh, yeah.  I haven't been over since the last time when he got uncomfortable because Fez thought I  was picking on him.  Well, he thinks everyone's picking on him.  But I'm not.  I wasn't.  Yeah.  He was in great spirits when I was there that day.  He was very glad to see you, like you came from another state. 
[01:49:00]  He's like, it's Jimmy from back home.  Tell me, what's the news back at the old channel?  I look forward to doing it.  Fez was doing really good for a while.  He's doing all right?  I was good.  Somebody yelled at him the other day and it's completely somebody from another part of the  building.  Yelled at him?  Yelled at him.  For what reason?  Well, you know, somebody, you know, some, whatever the, everyone gets this.  Another part of the building, you mean like not a Sirius XM person? 
[01:49:30]  Uh, yeah, a Sirius, but like a different floor.  Somebody from sales or one of those places.  What the fuck did they yell at him for?  I don't know.  They yelled at him fucking as an on-air guy.  Yeah.  Well, that, that's the fucking, you know, that's the, the fucking point too.  So, but then after that, so that went to him.  So everybody came around and was like helping him say, Fez, you're, you know, don't worry  about it.  But then Chris Stanley tells him a story yesterday that somebody in the building said, Hey, he 
[01:50:00]  comes up to Chris and goes like this, is Fez homeless?  Because he's in the building at all kinds of weird hours on the weekends and he wears  the same shirt a lot.  Right.  And when Fez heard that, it fucking, it turned him into a puddle, turned him into a puddle.  Why don't Chris tell him that?  Oh, for on-air laughter and meanness, you know, you got it.  You can't hold that one back.  That's too good.  It's like we secretly feel happy that Sam's gig's all fucked up today and people are canceled. 
[01:50:30]  Right, right.  You know?  Yeah, we'll make it work.  I know.  Oh, Fez.  You should, I don't know, he should just be in a bubble or something so he doesn't hear  any of this stuff.  Like a John Travolta bubble?  A John Travolta bubble for Fez.  That would be great.  It would be very good for you guys.  But he's hanging in there?  Yeah.  He's hanging in there.  Okay.  Is he here at weird hours on weekends?  I don't know.  I'm not even here.  Maybe he likes to come in and do some work.  Dude, I can't.  Well, he doesn't like to be in his apartment as much. 
[01:51:00]  Why?  I don't know.  He's got a weird thing with his fucking...  Here's the weird thing about Fez, and this is a fucking true story.  I talked to him, and this was like late January, so I'm talking to him on the phone.  And then I hear his...  And we're fucking talking in like fucking 30 seconds.  And finally, like after I hear four times, I go, dude, what the fuck is going on at your  apartment?  And he goes, oh, you mean the smoke detector?  His smoke detector, the battery went down, and it would make this horrendous sound every 
[01:51:30]  40 seconds.  And I go, what the fuck?  And he's like, well, it's too high for me to reach.  And he's just living with it instead of getting his stepladder.  And I go, how long has this been going on?  And he says, since Christmas.  And I'm like, this is your...  And he goes, but I don't have a ladder.  I go, go get a ladder.  Fucking take your shoe off.  Throw it.  Like, act like a person.  Right.  Go get a fucking broom.  Get a broom.  Knock it the fuck down.  Exactly.  Anything. 
[01:52:00]  Beat it with a hammer.  But fix your problem.  Does no one go to his apartment?  I was down, I saw him, like, about two years ago.  So we had lunch.  And then he just walked back and goes, this is my apartment.  And I'm like, oh, it looks like a great place.  I'm standing at the door with him.  And he wouldn't invite me in.  What's in there?  I don't know.  You've never been in there.  Does he hoard or is he messy?  He says, he used to be overly clean.  Now he says he's overly messy.  I have a feeling that the hoarding, because of the toenails and all that kind of stuff. 
[01:52:30]  You know what I mean?  I have a feeling that it's just stacked with old newspapers.  Crazy shit, yeah.  Crazy shit that he used.  Oh, you've got to get into his apartment for the radio show.  I'm sure there's stuff that he's taken from all the offices in here.  Some trophies?  Yeah.  He's got a few trophies in there, doesn't he?  There's, like, a fucking list of people he's going to kill someday.  Right.  Maybe even dead little baby bodies.  Yeah.  A couple of your beard hairs and a fucking...  Yeah.  Some chicken blood.  Some kind of shrine to you, Ron. 
[01:53:00]  Huh?  He's got a shrine to you in there somewhere.  I don't even say that.  He's got a shrine.  You've got to get in that apartment.  That would be amazing.  You could have a whole countdown and everything.  Fifty days before we, you know, fifty days to go before we get into Fez's apartment.  See, here's what makes me worried.  I know that he's down there now.  Just fucking, you know, screaming that we're talking about him.  Were you ever a radio rat, meaning you would hang out at the station all day long?  I used to.  I was always an in-and-out guy.  I'm an in-and-out guy now.  I can't take the bullshit. 
[01:53:30]  I think last minute that you can come in here, you'll do better radio.  Right.  I love that, too.  I can't do, like, I'll read the stories.  Travis will send an email with the stories.  I read them all the night before.  But I come in, I don't like to have the same discussion twice.  I can't do it.  I like to just come on and talk.  Same with the guests.  You want to bring the guests into the last...  Cold.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, but they come in and it's a commercial, and they tell you a funny story, and then you  try to re-get it.  It stinks.  Fuck it up.  And even if you're getting along with management, you know they just fucking, they're just poison 
[01:54:00]  for this on-air shit.  So as soon as we can get out of here, the better for everybody.  Sure.  They never help.  As soon as you walk down the hall, there's always some weird, dumb issue that you're not  even thinking about.  Like, ugh, why are you getting in my head with dumb shit?  So now it's like, get the fuck out immediately.  I just think it's the best way.  You know what I mean?  You just come in, you fucking say it, then you don't think about it.  You don't think about it, then you leave.  Right.  I mean, I don't even listen to the show anymore. 
[01:54:30]  I used to listen to every fucking show we did.  Did you really?  Back at AEW and stuff, yeah.  That would kill me.  That would kill me.  Long commutes and stuff, you know?  But now, I couldn't tell you the last time I even turned on the channel.  Yeah, I would just be thinking, why didn't you say something else?  Like, oh, fuck, I blew that.  I stepped on that.  Trust me, I know when I'm fucking up.  I don't need to re-hear it.  You know as soon as you do it, you know, that you fucked up.  No one wants to fuck in front of a mirror.  Right.  Not at all. 
[01:55:00]  I'll jerk off in front of one, though.  Jesus.  Mike in Wisconsin.  What's up, Mike?  We were talking a little while ago about how fans grow to hate each other and, you know,  break up and everything.  How do you guys do it every day?  I mean, you guys get together every day.  You've got to somehow interact with each other and be entertaining.  Yeah, we all play on the same softball team, so that's not good.  Yeah, you know.  And we have riff sessions after, but we just joke with each other.  We avoid each other when we're not here. 
[01:55:30]  That's how it works.  Yeah.  I don't see Anthony outside of this place.  He doesn't see me.  Whatsoever.  I see each of you.  I see...  Jimmy's like the go-between, I guess.  But no, I see Opie in the gym, or we live in the same neighborhood.  We literally live across the street from each other.  But it's a weird thing, because we collaborate creatively together.  Right.  Bands do what they do in tour, but literally we are collaborating creatively for fucking  20 hours a week.  Right.  That's a tremendous amount of time, to not just be with other people, like you're in 
[01:56:00]  an office, but to be bouncing around your own spur-of-the-moment creative ideas.  It's amazing that it works as well as it does.  And it's, you know, I know for me and Anthony, when we're outside the studio talking, it's  a waste of time.  I'm like, oh my God, that would have been great on the radio.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Sure.  So I don't feel like talking to them at all, because I'm always thinking, ah, fuck, that  would have been great for the radio.  So, you know.  It does suck, too, when something like that happens.  There's no problems. 
[01:56:30]  It's just, you know, we have an understanding, and we just kind of go our separate ways when  we're not here.  It's kind of cool to everyone go do what they do and come back the next morning or Monday,  and Obi brings his life, and I bring mine, and Anthony brings his life.  It's like you're all bringing different shit back with you.  Like, you're all going out on your own and bringing different shit back with you to throw  on the table, as opposed to living the same experiences and then going back and going,  remember we did that yesterday?  Right.  That was great on Saturday.  Yeah, I mean, it's the same reason that you don't bring your chick in here during the  fucking show.  Oh, God, no.  Yeah, I mean, it'd be nuts. 
[01:57:00]  You want to keep it separated a little bit.  Absolutely.  I can't bring a chick in here, because they'd be looking at her like, well, you know, she  looks a little, uh, there's something about her.  We're not familiar in a weird way.  I never understood the radio guys that brought their wives onto this show.  No, it's crazy.  I never understood that.  Maybe, maybe every once in a while, I think at any W, my ex was on every, like maybe, maybe  once a year tops, but I just can't see that, how that works.  And I don't think it does work. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, when they come on as a permanent thing or a constant?  Right.  Or bringing up shit from home.  Right.  Like when they think, oh, it'd be entertaining if we have this fight on the air.  Right.  You're just fucking asking to destroy that.  Right.  Exactly.  You're going to destroy your life.  Exactly.  It depends on, like my, my ex-girlfriend, I thought was a generally funny, mean person.  And, uh, her, I would, I talked about all the time because most of my experiences with  her, but, uh, and her, I would do a podcast with her.  Right.  You know what I mean?  I couldn't do radio every day with her, but.  But the, but the point was it's ex now. 
[01:58:00]  You know what I mean?  Like, you know, if you really want to fucking hang in, you, you'll fuck it up.  You just have to.  Right.  Absolutely.  And I think that you can give too much away.  You know what I mean?  I don't, I think you gotta hold something back for yourself.  Oh, from the audience?  Yeah.  I've, I've, well, if that's true, I fucking, that ship sailed on me a long time ago.  But don't you think the worst thing Ozzy ever did was that TV show?  No, it was the best.  Because I, I think him totally different than the way I do before the TV show. 
[01:58:30]  See, I, the thing, the reason, the reason I love him more now is because he's flawed and  I know he's flawed and he's this guy and he's this real guy and that's who I like.  Like, um, I don't need the, or, or, or desire to see like, oh wow, he's the rock and roll  madman.  Cause like, I don't give a shit about that.  Like I, he, he's, he's, that's the guy I've always liked.  Like that's the goofball that fucking puts these funny videos before his shows and does 
[01:59:00]  all this silly shit.  Like the guy who was funny, you know, whenever he was on for, for years, he'd be on fucking  starring or any other show and was hilarious.  And Florentine used to go, you gotta hear what fucking Ozzy said this morning, you know?  Like Ozzy's really funny, hilarious.  He's a very funny, uh, individual, but him being a hilarious, funny, like comic funny guy  doesn't match with rock and roll demon madman.  I like the real thing.  I just, I wonder how he got away playing both roles so long till, you know, cause he still  does the demon madman thing. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  And lives in Beverly Hills.  That's a little strange.  Yeah, lives in Beverly Hills and the dog shuts in the floor.  Right.  I just felt like they were mocking him on that show rather than him being funny.  Nah, cause Sharon's very protective.  Like, you know, the mockery might've come in the fact that we don't expect to see that  or him fumbling around, but that's just part of his, uh, to me that makes him endearing.  And charming.  And I, I love that fucking, I like the flawed side.  So I hold, there's things I hold back from the audience, but I like it cause it was a  real reality show.  Yes.  It wasn't assisted reality or nothing. 
[02:00:00]  You really were seeing these people in their home environment.  Yeah.  They're real people, but you understood underneath all of it.  They were a real family unit and they were actually protective of each other.  Like for as much as, all right, yeah, Ozzy's fucked up in a goofball and Sharon yells and  screams, you know, they, they kind of, they were very, uh, they were very caring about  each other and they protected each other.  And when Cosby piped up about that family, oh, did she fucking tear him a new asshole  and he apologized?  He better be, she better be careful.  He'll drug her. 
[02:00:30]  But no, I, I hold back personal names from the audience.  Like I'll never give away who I've been with or like, I don't like that shit cause you  know, they're, they're private citizens, but my own stuff, that's all fine.  You know, I like to have a bit of a private life too.  It's kind of nice.  You know, I have a ton of stories I could tell.  I just don't feel like it.  I like, I like keeping a little to myself.  Tell one, just tell one really personal thing.  Well, one time.  Am I wrong when I did this?  Am I wrong when I did this, folks? 
[02:01:00]  Well, now she's not talking to me.  You like my, uh, my smoothie, Ron?  You do the health thing?  It's fucking soylent grain.  Yeah, it's, it's grass clippings is what it is.  The NutriBullet, the NutriBullet people are loving me right now.  It's better than eating eggs and bacon in the morning.  No.  Do you eat healthy at all ever?  No.  You said fuck that, right?  Well, I just, you know, I'm trying, it's a slow suicide.  Yeah.  But, um, this is, uh, well, you do, uh, half.  No, no, don't say what's in it. 
[02:01:30]  That's one of those things you kind of keep for yourself.  Do not live.  Imagine.  Well, the secret ingredient is cum.  It's, uh, it's kale.  Kale's a new big thing, right?  Kale is like, I guess, one of those superfoods, I believe.  I think, I think it's officially a superfood now.  I got kale, leafy spinach.  People love when I tell them what's in my NutriBullet, so they've been waiting for this moment, Ron.  So it's kale, leafy spinach, uh, uh, frozen pineapple chunks. 
[02:02:00]  Now, do you do this yourself?  You make it yourself?  Yeah, the NutriBullet blender is amazing.  I'm not getting paid by the NutriBullet people.  I just love their product that much.  Then I throw in a little, uh, frozen mango chunks, to keep it honest.  And then, uh, some, uh, some yogurt.  Fat-free yogurt.  How many times do you do this a day?  Once.  This is my breakfast.  Because I can't eat in the morning, so I'm getting nutrition this way.  And then I finish it off with a raw handful of oatmeal.  And then I grind it down, and look, it's like mush. 
[02:02:30]  That's great.  Well, I'll tell you, and I don't want to fuck with you, but you're still going to die.  Of course.  No matter what you do, you're still going to die.  Of course.  But I decided to have kids as an old man, so I'm going to try to at least last a little  longer.  What do you want to do?  Make it to graduation?  That would be nice.  You don't think I'd do the math?  That would be nice.  Graduation would be nice.  I already realized there's no fucking way I'm going to ever be a grandfather.  That I already said, okay.  I'd do the math on that one.  Do you have a decent life insurance thing?  Sure.  Yeah.  Yeah, they'll figure it out after I'm gone. 
[02:03:00]  That always feels better.  You know what I mean?  What?  Having it all set?  Yeah, like, oh, God, I'm more dead than alive.  This is great for everyone.  Robert Klein did a funny bit about life insurance.  You ever see Robert Klein at Yale, which is one of the best stand-ups ever done, where  he does a great bit about life insurance and how he just doesn't care once people die  because he won't be there.  Right.  That's kind of a nice attitude.  Did he get into the I Can't Stop My Leg thing right after that?  That was the closer, as we all know.  But this was the lead-up.  His advertising shit was fucking masterful. 
[02:03:30]  I've got to try to listen to him again.  I never got it to Robert Klein.  Yeah.  He's funny as shit.  Dude, he's one of my fucking idols.  Yeah, I really, which one should I check out?  Robert Klein, Live at Yale.  All right, I'm going to try.  I'm going to try.  Did you see the David Steinberg documentary on Showtime?  I didn't, but I used to love him as a Tonight Show guest host.  I would watch it.  You will love it.  And the weird thing is, is that you go back and watch this, and it's like him, it's  like Mike Nichols in like 64, and you're like, holy shit, comedy used to be so much 
[02:04:00]  smarter, you know, really fucking brilliant stuff, well-read stuff, you know?  He's a really, really funny dude.  I finally met him at some Curb Your Enthusiasm thing.  I guess he had directed one of the episodes.  Yeah, he directs a lot.  He did a lot of Seinfeld, a lot of Curb.  Oh, did he do Seinfeld?  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  Do you think stand-up has been dumbed down in the last 20 years?  I just think America.  I know there's clever guys doing it, obviously, but in general, do you think? 
[02:04:30]  I think it's more about the audience.  Like, I think there's plenty of things that the audience wouldn't accept or sit through.  Wouldn't follow.  Right.  You know what I mean?  They need stuff faster all the time.  Right.  No matter what the art form is.  I don't know if it has.  I mean, there's some funny guys now that come, like when you, like, again, like we kind  of look back at those older times, like, wow, that was the days, but then you look  back and there was a lot of shit television in the 70s.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Like, garbage in the 50s and lousy comics stealing each other's shit back then.  You know, they were great comedians, but they didn't hit social issues until fucking 
[02:05:00]  Lenny Bruce and Dick Gregory.  I mean...  You try to listen to Lenny Bruce now, though?  It's a little rough.  It's not...  It's almost like, what's the big deal?  But you forget.  You forget.  Yeah, it was shocking.  You forget that he was saying all this stuff for the first time and getting arrested for  it and going to jail, but it doesn't hold...  Lenny Bruce does not hold up.  Not as well.  I've tried so many times to go and listen to some of his stuff.  But it's really weird because, like, even the Kinison religious stuff...  Right.  ...that was so shocking.  Now people have heard so many religious jokes. 
[02:05:30]  If you play it for a kid, they're like, yeah.  Really?  You're like, no, you don't understand.  This is really, you know...  Kinison blew my mind the first time I heard him.  Yeah, absolutely.  Wow, he's saying this.  Holy crap.  It's like this stuff Sam's doing with his dating game thing.  Wow.  Where are we at with the dating game?  He comes out, he blows the doors right off, just opens up screaming.  Rodney told Sam...  Hey, kid, just start with the dating game.  What time do we have to start the dating game?  Whenever you're ready.  Everyone's here?  Everyone's here.  Oh, let's... 
[02:06:00]  I mean, let's get the laugh started.  I'm going to be embarrassed in front of Ron Bennington.  Why?  We got Bobo in and Denny.  I mean, this is going to be...  Is Denny coming in?  Oh, yeah.  A lot of benchmark.  Who do we got?  Bobo, Denny, and a mystery.  A mystery, yes, yeah.  That we're going to announce very soon.  We both guessed.  Is it the old dating game from TV?  Yeah.  And they're going to...  She's not seeing them?  I mean, we're going to put banners up so she can't see them, but she just saw two of  them last week.  She knows who they are.  And then what happens?  I mean, what's the twist? 
[02:06:30]  Are they going to be asking questions?  The twist?  She'll ask the questions?  She'll ask the questions.  So we just have to sit here?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, all right.  I can handle that.  And then they go on an actual date?  Yeah.  To where?  Dave and Buster's, probably.  Somewhere, I don't know, local.  Oh, we don't have that part figured out?  I mean, Dave and Buster's, unless you want them to go someplace else.  Well, I think it's got to be kind of like a five-star restaurant.  You think so?  That's Dave and Buster's.  Dave and Buster's.  Yeah.  Times Square.  There's a Times Square one.  It's got to have a Michelin award.  That's the later. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You know, this is probably more inside than anything, but I love talking about Don Wicklund  when Ronnie's in.  Don Wicklund is so shell-shocked from his first tour of duty with us.  He's just convinced I'm going to rip his fucking head off his body.  And I have to tell him every single time, I'm not that guy anymore.  But he is shell-shocked.  Nah, I can't do it anymore.  He's very fond of you.  Yeah.  Did you see the Sports Illustrated covers out today?  Yeah.  Was that with Barbie? 
[02:07:30]  No, it was three asses.  Three girls lined up asses.  Really?  Let's see it.  Let me see it.  Oh, Sam, quick, find it.  Faster, Sam.  Yeah, we want to apologize to our contestants who are waiting.  I want the Jeopardy clip, too.  Oh, wow.  Look at this.  What happened to the Barbie fucking cover?  They said, screw that.  No, you don't.  Maybe that's a slip cover.  It's a slip cover.  Oh, yeah.  It's a promotional wrap.  Oh, okay.  Where's the cover?  Wow.  There he is.  Jesus.  Sam can open it on the, uh, they make a bigger picture there. 
[02:08:00]  Wow.  I just said nothing.  I think you did well.  I know.  There you go.  I just ran out of steam.  Uh-huh.  That should be the fucking dating game right here.  Oh, no kidding.  A hot woman will just shut...  Oh, yeah.  You know what?  It will shut everybody up.  Those are decent asses.  They're not great.  What do you mean decent?  Honestly, look at the way that the girl all the way on the left.  I'm not being fucking Pete Picky.  Her ass flattens out.  And the one on the left, they both flatten out.  Yeah, because it's a white girl's ass.  It's a white girl's ass.  A nice white girl's ass.  Get that Jen. 
[02:08:30]  What's her name from fucking Twitter?  Who had to come obsessed with her ass?  Jen.  Yeah.  What's that?  From the list we did.  Yeah.  Go get that.  Jen L.  Where are you at?  Where are you at with asses?  Oh, fine.  I'm fine with that.  You're fine with a nice, solid white ass.  I'm fine with the girl that the Post made famous for the Instagram ass girl, right?  Yes.  She's great.  It's big.  Her ass is...  Oh, good.  There's a lot of juice in there.  It's a perfect...  Too much juice.  No, no, no.  Show me the picture again.  It's a fucking...  Her ass is almost...  It's worshipable.  Worshipable. 
[02:09:00]  Those asses are average at best.  That's why they should have covered it for me.  That's sexier.  I feel like you need extra skills to take care of an ass like that.  Not to sniff it.  I feel like you really have to be on your game when you get one of those booty asses  in front of you.  You've got to come in like Jeter.  You've got to be as much thought into that as anything else.  You've got to work hard in spring training.  You're saying an ass like that is a 3-0 pitch, and my fucking big one is like 0-2 going to  the opposite field.  I feel like that's like, you've got to be on your game. 
[02:09:30]  What number was she?  I don't remember.  We're never going to find her number.  I think her name is Jen...  Oh, fuck me.  Jen...  Do you follow her?  No.  The Instagram fucking queen, just, you know...  The Instagram ass, it's so juicy and perfect.  It's sad how nice her ass is.  Oh, boy.  Put Jen ass Instagram, Sam, before I fucking...  It's Jen?  Yes.  That's Jen eight times.  G-E, not G-E-N.  Generous.  Jen Seltzer. 
[02:10:00]  There you go, Seltzer.  All right, let's look at her.  Google image this, bro.  It's fucking awesome, her ass.  Seltzer.  Yeah, there you go.  A little Google image.  Okay.  That's a plump...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Dude, that fucking is amazing.  Yeah, that's fine.  That's totally fine.  That should be on the cover of Sports Illustrated.  I would have no trouble.  Much more...  Yeah, that's fine.  That's not what I'm talking about.  That's perfect.  Get those fucking flat asses off Sports Illustrated cover.  They're terrible.  They're fucking...  They're like shuffleboard fucking...  Yeah, you don't need any extra training to be all right with that ass. 
[02:10:30]  That's fine.  She stays in training.  She thinks about her ass all the time.  This is her living.  You got us.  It's just this ass.  That's why we should date, because that's all I would think of.  Oh, Jesus.  Climbing the walls.  That's amazing.  Yeah, she's terrific.  Hands on one wall, feet on the other wall, with the ass straight up toward the ceiling.  That's an amazing picture.  What's wrong with the booking department, Sam?  We haven't got her in yet.  You're right.  There's something wrong with the booking department.  I've asked, and they've just refused. 
[02:11:00]  Who do we got to put on this?  Whose thing is just asses?  Is that Spencer?  I think Spencer's...  Spencer's the ass guy.  Asses movies?  Yeah.  We did the dating game.  We only have our girl for a limited time, because she has another commitment.  We'll take a short break.  We'll get the guys in, including the surprise guest.  And is it Lexi Love today?  Yes.  All right.  She's always good.  She's a trooper.  Yeah, Lexi's very good.  She's a treat. 
[02:11:30]  And then we'll do this dating game thing for Valentine's Day.  Yeah, with some unique personalities that we haven't heard from in an hour and ten minutes.  Bobo?  Are you not a Bobo fan, Jim?  I like Bobo a lot, actually.  Oh, you do?  Yes.  What I don't like is the redundancy.  Does he really have 58,000 Twitter followers?  What happened?  Someone probably bought him some followers.  Yeah.  As of last night, he had 58,000 followers.  Yeah.  As of night before last, he had 4,000 followers.  Okay, so things are picking up.  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:12:00]  Things are picking up for him.  Wait, how do you do that?  I'll do that.  You can just go to a service and buy followers.  I might have to do that.  No, they go away, though.  Twitter weeds them out.  Really?  Yeah, all the bots.  Twitter goes through it.  I have no problem crunching my numbers a little bit, patting them.  And if you go through his list, none of them have real profile photos.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Like, have you ever been looking through your thing and it says, hey, 165 people followed  you, but you're like, I only have two more followers than I had before.  Right.  I think because they're just chopping fucking bogus profiles that just pop up.  I think any of the big ones are fake, though, because I've done things where people, you 
[02:12:30]  know, I'll do an interview with them and we'll say, you can invite your followers and  they'll have like a million six followers, right?  Right.  And then we'll hear like, 10 people would like to come to this fucking, like out of a million  six, 10?  Yeah.  You know, you're not a fucking drawl.  If I had a club, I'd be very fucking nervous about people and their followers.  I like Twitter at times, but I know I'm talking to way less than what my number is.  Absolutely.  Like, extremely low percentage of, you know, the amount of followers. 
[02:13:00]  I think Twitter's over.  No.  And then we're on Instagram.  Really?  I don't know.  Yeah.  No, I don't know.  Because it's such an instant communication.  You can really, you can reach out immediately and talk to people.  Yeah, it's good to promote stuff, but.  And it's simple.  It's very simple.  I think it was a waste of time, man.  Who the fuck really is reading this?  It's such a small number.  It's being covered by the news now.  CNN.  Sure.  They follow everybody's Twitter.  That's why people are getting fired, though.  Right.  I don't know.  I love it.  I would say less than 10% of your followers are reading your actual tweets. 
[02:13:30]  That's a low fucking number.  Well, I think the problem is maybe 30% of them are fake or 40% are fake.  I mean, everyone.  This is not, this is from Obama down to guy with 10 followers.  To Katy Perry?  Yes.  Justin Bieber?  No, the Biebs are all real.  Oh, okay.  I thought so.  I'm not, no disrespect.  I think, let's say 50% are fake just by, because they're, they're, they're created bots to, and then of the 50%, 10 or 15% are reading.  So if you have a million followers, 15% of 50% of that, which is 15% of 500,000. 
[02:14:00]  Right.  50,000.  Here's what we should do in a contest with you, with you guys and Ant, is see who can get in trouble with management first.  But something that you tweet, like, I'm glad Julia Roberts' sister killed herself.  You know what I mean?  How, how long will it take before finally the bosses go, look, what is happening down there?  That Julia Roberts story is twisted, too, man.  Yeah.  It is twisted, because they have another article in the paper that Julia Roberts prevented her half-sister from seeing the mom after the tell-all book, though. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, the fucking sister was, look, and again.  The sister out of nowhere, the half-sister who killed herself, did this whole tell-all book.  Yeah.  So then Julia Roberts was like, oh, really?  Well, look what I do now.  Now you're not going to see mommy anymore.  Me, me, me.  And I say this because she had a fucking fiancé, and she wrote part of her apology to him.  And it's like, you selfish motherfucker.  You know you got this guy that's in love with you.  Right.  So stop telling people Julia Roberts is your sister, then. 
[02:15:00]  Right.  If she's such a cunt, fuck her.  Just don't deal with her.  Live your life.  If she's a fucking fat-shaming Hollywood, okay, fuck her.  You don't have to live with her.  But, you know, she wanted the attention.  That's why she bugs me this one.  It must feel great to know that you can fucking hurt your sister just by killing yourself.  Like, even one person go, how could you make that girl kill her?  I mean, what could anyone say to you that would make...  I can't imagine anyone in my family could do anything worse than they've already done. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  Just by being family.  I was thinking that exact thing the other day when this all went down.  I'm like, hmm, who in my family, if they killed themselves, would I be bothered by if I was in their suicide note?  But if they blamed you directly, almost anybody.  I come from a different place.  I grew up with a me-me person in the house.  So whatever.  You kill yourself, whatever.  And you're going to say shitty things about me, whatever.  I understand where it's coming from.  Yeah.  Period.  Yeah.  It's kind of cold, but it's the truth.  No, that's probably the right way to look at it. 
[02:16:00]  You know.  I feel sad about it, but then, like, what do you do?  Oh, I feel...  Yeah, I feel sad, I guess.  I've never had anybody mention me in a suicide note.  It would be nice, right?  It would be nice once.  It would be nice.  Could one girl on a date and just fucking blow your brains out and make me a legend?  He fucked her and then quit and she couldn't live without his cock.  That would be nice to read.  Instead of just saying that they feel relieved and they've lost weight, they've changed their hair.  They'll have fucking...  It's like a Breck commercial when I stop fucking her.  It would be nice, though, right?  Breck commercial.  Yeah, Breck. 
[02:16:30]  Could I have fucking picked a more outdated product than Breck?  Fucking old man.  Oh, it's like a legs commercial.  It so works, though.  I know, but there's so many ways to...  Can I see the fucking blue?  That's a video, Sam.  What are you fucking...  What's wrong?  I don't know.  Oh, wow.  Well, can you imagine...  Whose ass doesn't look good when you're in that position, though?  On all fours.  Even a monster's ass looks good.  Go to those flat asses.  If she's on all fours.  This is great, though, because it reminds you of, like, when George Costanza was the 
[02:17:00]  hands model, remember?  He has to put gloves on.  That's how she treats her ass, though.  Oh, yeah.  She can't get a pimple.  No.  Not at all.  Not at all.  That's right.  She can't get a honey spider.  Sam, you don't think these are great asses, too?  No, look at the left cheek.  Look at how tiny that dumb left cheek on that girl on the left is.  They're pushing them up a little bit, but they're nice, solid white girl asses, although  there's a little...  They're a bit exotic.  They got about 20% exotic in them.  Those asses stink.  I like the one on the end in the pink, but the other...  Why?  It looks like a mirror. 
[02:17:30]  You're the flat ass idiot on the end.  The reason the one on the end in the pink doesn't work is her ass is too white compared  to the rest of the body.  They need to fucking put a little makeup on her.  They should have bounced that shit out.  Yeah, they should have bounced that shit out.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's not the color, dude.  Honestly, it's the shape.  Those asses flatten out.  I have a better ass than those fucking girls.  You should be on there.  I absolutely have a better ass than those girls.  We've got to get you out of a magazine for your calves.  You know that, right?  Everyone knows my calves.  You know that.  Show Ronnie. 
[02:18:00]  Please, show Ronnie.  Come on.  Ron has seen them.  What, does he not see my calves?  Does he not have fucking Twitter?  He's got amazing calves, Ronnie.  Yeah, but that's common knowledge, and he's preaching to those, of course.  You should be the cab kid on Instagram.  You should really start that.  Everybody's talking about cab kid.  Jimmy, you should start that as a goof.  Just pictures of your calves.  That's a fucking ass.  Wow.  That girl has a fucking ass.  Why do you have that picture?  Because it was sent to me.  Oh, all right.  That girl has a fucking rump.  No, she sent it to you to say what? 
[02:18:30]  Big fan?  What?  No, mom and dad want to talk to you.  You're in trouble.  I guess it's dating game time, huh?  You setting everything up during the commercial?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, chubby ass is cool.  Do you have confidence in this?  No, he doesn't.  And he shouldn't.  It's all the crux is on you guys.  You guys have the power in your hands.  It's up to her.  She even picks.  Yeah, we just have to watch.  It's a guy, but you guys have the power to make it. 
[02:19:00]  Do we have to pump this up, or can we sit back and just watch?  You can sit back and just watch.  It's Friday.  I'm good for just watching today.  Are you taking off Monday for President's Day?  Yes.  Yeah, you have to.  I am, but not for all the presidents.  There's a couple.  A couple.  There's a few years to get behind.  Hmm?  Oh, my God.  How fucking phenomenal is that?  Let me see.  He's showing a picture of a cop.  That's really fucking nice.  That's a juicy.  It's big.  It's a little on the big side, though.  But not unhealthy.  Big, that's a fucking juicy. 
[02:19:30]  I want to just, like, as soon as your dick goes into the pussy from the back, you just  want to start cumming.  Jesus.  Sky Talk Radio.  Too much information.  Dating game next.  Look at these fucking flat asses.  They're going to bug me the whole thing.  Take that off the screen.  With Ron Bennington.  Dating game next with Ron Bennington.  Am I picking who I'm taking out?  Yes.  We got jingles, too.  Oh, great.  This isn't half ass.  Do we do a jingle now? 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is every jingle, we apologize to the audience.  We're sorry.  You see what I mean about you guys having the power?  Oh.  Kind of.  I want to thank Stevie Knight on Twitter.  He put together the, I saw the sign girl with the actual video.  How's it look?  It looks pretty fucking funny, man.  It's on my YouTube channel, OP Radio, and I tweeted, I don't know, a few hours ago, I  guess.  OP Radio on Twitter.  Jim Norton on Twitter.  And, of course, the eye bag. 
[02:20:30]  What does that mean, the eye bag?  The Interobank.  It's a question mark and explanation point.  Some of those things seem like a good idea at the time.  I like it.  It's a great site.  Go check it out and check out the Twitter, the eye bag.  All right?  Can I plug real quick?  Sure.  Just in case we end on some kind of a disaster.  Just in case we go home?  Yes.  Saturday night.

I'm going to lay your back or something, and I'm going to lick all the way down your neck  like this.  I'm going to take my tongue and just go like...  I'm going to clean out your ears or something and get wax on my tongue, and then lick all  the way down your neck.  Oh, that's a nice dark nipple.  I wouldn't mind getting some milk out of that.  And then I'm going to get my tongue, and I'm going to start flicking it all over your

My mum, right?  She's bending right back.  And then I had one choice because I was naked. 
[02:32:00]  It was the middle of the day, right?  Fucking 110 degrees of Australian heat, like in your measurement, right?  I'm sitting under my bed having a wake.  My mum walks in the room.  I throw the magazine down the side of the bed in one motion.  And she goes, clean this fucking room up.  And she goes, why are you laying in your bed?  I'm going, you know, just having a nap, you know.  And she just goes, well, get up now.  And she goes, why are you getting up?  I said, well, get up.  Can you get the fuck out?  She starts pulling on my duvet.  My erection strengthens. 
[02:32:30]  No, she's pulling on my duvet.  I'm panicking, like, oh, fuck.  And I'm going, please, mum.  Please, mum, no.  And I had to make a decision, right?  She's a big woman.  I had to make a decision.  I let go of the duvet.  She goes flying backwards into the cupboard.  And I flip onto my stomach as quick as possible.  Yeah, so I've still got this sweaty fucking bald ass sticking up.  And a 300-pound mum crying and falling on the ground.  Things couldn't have gone worse. 
[02:33:00]  Anyway, enough about me.  Back to the retards.  And that was your masturbation memory for the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, it's me.  God, you're so fucking mad.  I don't want to fucking go crazy with this.  I want to fucking eat you and fuck you.  And suck your tits.  If you agree with this, say yes.  But yes, be in the best. 
[02:33:30]  I told that you're into her.  But I want to fucking lick your pussy and make you cum so much.  I don't want to fucking go crazy with you.  Go out the bathroom and let me have a voice now.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  After 20 years, you would want to break, too.  But the guys are back now in charge. 
[02:34:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on Sirius XM.  Getting ready for the dating game.  As soon as I found out Ron could do the show with me, we should have just canceled the 
[02:34:30]  dating game.  What are we doing?  I think it's going to go good.  This is all Sam's.  You know, this is Sam's thing.  I think Anthony was smart bailing on the dating game.  Well, Anthony has double pneumonia is why I was called early this morning.  Anthony has double pneumonia.  Get there immediately.  Take the perfect date.  I'll fucking blow off.  So where's, uh, where's the, where's the, where's the, where's the dates?  Who come in first?  Yeah.  Do the boys come in first?  Sam.  Do the girl?  How's it work?  We're watching you orchestrate this thing. 
[02:35:00]  We're watching you watch us.  Yeah.  So what do you got?  I see you got the screen up, like the old dating game.  Yeah.  Even though everyone knows who Lexi Love is.  That's true.  But Lexi.  But I think we could trick Bobo.  Yeah.  We could probably trick Bobo.  And Lexi only knows two of the three guys, so.  Oh, boy.  You know, just like the real dating game.  Right.  Who kid?  Who kid?  What do you say, dude?  What up, son?  You look tired.  You all right?  Who kid just.  I got to record five hours.  And I got to get on an 8 o'clock flight tomorrow.  Where are you going tomorrow? 
[02:35:30]  San Francisco.  And then I go to San Jose.  Oh, we live.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  What up, guys?  I almost said some shit I was going to say.  How's everything going?  You got an easy trip.  Only San Francisco.  That's a piece of cake for you.  No, I go to San Jose Sunday.  Then I go to Vegas for magic.  Then I go to 26-hour flight to Croatia.  That's what I'm talking about.  Jesus.  I was waiting for the 26-hour flight.  Croatia, London, Milan, Nice.  Who kid's Instagram is one of the best ones out there? 
[02:36:00]  I know.  Because he travels the world on weekends.  On weekends.  He doesn't spend a week in these places.  It's two days tops, right?  No, one day.  It's one day.  One day per country.  You're going to go to Croatia, and you're coming back the next day?  No, Croatia, then London, then Milan, then Nice.  You going with 50 Cent, or you?  No, just me.  Now, are you DJing parties?  All parties.  All within a week.  That's your itinerary.  Do they have to fly you?  Yeah, they pay for the flights. 
[02:36:30]  They pay for the hotel.  Some of the gigs are 6,500.  Some of them are 7,500.  One hour, two hours.  Get my dick sucked.  Nice city, motherfucker.  So, yeah.  Do you fly to coach or business or first?  Sometimes I take coach so I can keep the money, so I don't give a fuck.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I'm a nigga, man.  I'll be in coach.  I ain't white.  White people waste money on fucking business class.  That's a write-off.  I got time for that shit.  Only if it's like flight to like Australia.  How about Croatia? 
[02:37:00]  Croatia, 26 hours.  That, I don't give a fuck because they're paying you like 20 Gs for two gigs in one day.  Really?  So, I kept all the money.  Because they want me to take the money.  They give you a travel buyout.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A travel buyout, yeah.  So, I was like, fuck it.  I'll just keep it and I'll just get on a cheap flight.  I'm a cheap motherfucker.  See, that travel buyouts are weird.  Like, I'm going to LA to do the Ontario Improv.  And they give you a travel buyout.  So, normally, I'll fly first because the coverage is.  But the flights are fucking expensive.  Yeah.  So, me and Kenny are going to go to JetBlue. 
[02:37:30]  1,500 sometimes.  It's 1,200.  All right.  But you're a star.  You know what I'm saying?  Please, I'm a fucking.  I'm a glorified middle who has a fucking lucky amount of radio show.  Glorified middle.  You can sit next to Dewey Houser or something like that.  Come on, man.  I don't know how you do it.  I don't know how you fly all over the world like that.  Especially last night.  Oh, my God.  I had a party with Wiz and then I met some chick and then I had a Valentine's Day on 63rd and 1st.  What'd you do there?  In my car.  You had your own special Valentine's Day. 
[02:38:00]  Some crazy girl.  I got food.  I'll show you how to food.  She sucked your penis?  Yeah, sucked my dick.  Fucked in the car.  And then there's no police there.  What the fuck is over 63rd and 1st?  What?  You want the police to be there?  I thought there'd be cops around there.  It's a very nice neighborhood.  They don't need the police.  My wife is sleeping and shit.  You know what I'm saying?  Happy Valentine's Day.  Hope your wife is not listening.  Do you wear a condom?  Yeah, of course.  I think I'm reckless. 
[02:38:30]  I'm in my car.  Do you ever feel a little guilty when you're getting blown?  You look over and see the baby seat there.  You know what's crazy?  You say that?  My son's coat was back there.  And my son is 14.  I was like, damn, look at this motherfucker's coat in here.  Really?  It's a little gap coat, too.  I was like, damn.  So I guess the wife's cool with this shit?  She's not listening, is she?  Nobody cheats anymore.  I don't understand.  Oh, man. 
[02:39:00]  This is a normal world.  Nobody cheats.  Like, stars don't cheat.  It's too fucking.  Jim is like, what the fuck?  I'm a terrible boyfriend.  I'm single, though.  So it doesn't matter.  Oh, so you're good.  You fuck for free.  You did?  No.  It's always a financial.  Oh, you can pay.  That's good, too.  But it's cheaper in Europe.  Is it?  I can't fuck with Vegas.  It's like two Gs for pussy, man.  That's...  Fuck my wife any day before I pay two Gs.  Yeah.  That's great.  Yeah, if you're not going to upgrade, you're certainly not going to pay for it.  Wow. 
[02:39:30]  I get it for free.  Two Gs.  I'll pay a hundred bucks for it, though.  A hundred bucks is a good deal.  But you don't care if the girl doesn't want you.  Yeah.  I like when, you know, a girl wants you.  Like, paying for it.  That's why I never really understood that world.  No, I don't care.  You don't care?  No, because I get to zone.  I'm more comfortable when I know that they have...  I don't think I have to connect to them or do anything if I'm paying them.  It's a job.  Even, like, strippers and lap dances.  Like, this is all horseshit.  She doesn't fucking want to be doing this to, you know, me, this lap dance, whatever. 
[02:40:00]  Do you feel the same thing about the cable guy?  Like, he doesn't really care about my TV.  He's just doing it for money.  Fios.  That's great.  Good point, sir.  Good point.  That's great, yeah.  I mean, if you think about it, you waste, like, what?  You're married, you waste a million a year on your wife.  If you make five million...  What?  Think about it.  Waste a million a year.  If you make five, six million a year and a million goes to your wife...  I don't make that.  Well, whatever.  If you make, like, a huge amount of money, a huge amount goes to your wife. 
[02:40:30]  Right.  A hundred bucks is nothing for a random pussy.  No, it's not about the money.  It's about the fact that, like, I would know she's not into me.  You need love.  You need love.  A little love.  A little love.  Either love or lust or both.  You're like a white L Cool J or something, man.  What do you want love like that, man?  Or lust.  You would feel bad if she just suddenly checked her watch?  Yes.  Or gave you...  Let's wrap it up.  Do you know how many times...  That's why I'm asking the question, because I'm being real here. 
[02:41:00]  I've been fucking around and seeing a hooker who I think I'm having fun with.  Glance at the clock.  I'm like, oh, yeah.  Ah, that sucks.  That would be...  Or give you the light.  That would be a huge turn off.  No, it's not a huge turn off.  That's not a turn off to you guys.  It tells me I'm lollygagging.  It's time to shoot my lolly.  God, I'm going to go for that.  I'm a pussy, I guess.  That is whack.  When they want to hurry up and just take the money...  Hey, that's your job.  I mean, I don't work for...  When I'm on stage, I don't just sit down and fuck her.  I do my job and I'm done.  All right.  Okay.  It's a good job.  All right.  Dating game time. 
[02:41:30]  Who Kid is here in the house.  Follow him on Instagram.  Your Instagram is different than your Twitter.  I get confused every fucking time.  Just Who Kid, because I lost the first one from a pussy shot.  This girl had see-through panties and the cunt was...  And they took your account instead of just saying, delete that picture?  Well, my publicist was a fucking asshole, was getting the warning emails, but didn't tell  me.  So the third warning I got was when I put that...  Did you fire your publicist?  No.  She gave me heads.  I got to keep her.  Oh, really?  Is she looking for new clients? 
[02:42:00]  Well, that's a reason to keep your publicist.  Of course.  She put some fucked up shit out there about me, so I got to keep her.  But anyway, yeah.  Pussy shot was out there.  But they should just say you can have it back eventually.  What the fuck?  I tried to go through the channels and stuff, but it's like Instagram is like pussies over  there.  Who has it?  Well, somebody...  I had at DJ Who Kid, but I can't get it back.  Right.  That sucks.  They're the worst.  Dealing with them or Facebook, there's no one you can call and talk to.  They're the fucking worst. 
[02:42:30]  You too.  Pussies.  You can't get to any of these people.  It's like fallopian humans over there.  And they're serious about their stuff.  Relax.  Who cares?  Look at your service.  You should allow a push shot every once in a while.  They're more for the kids and stuff like that and the grandmas.  Instagram.  Yeah, because they're snitching on you.  If you put a potty or whatever, you get snitched on.  That's how you get caught.  Right.  But I got booty on my shit right now.  You think it's going to get shit done?  I don't know.  Maybe.  You're all right with your booty stuff.  Yeah.  You show just enough. 
[02:43:00]  You like my Instagram, though.  I love your Instagram.  Like I said, I'm amazed that every weekend I can't keep up with where you are.  It's crazy.  You're on the road.  I'm looking at your Instagram.  I'm like, so we...  You don't like that, Sam?  No.  All right, Sam.  It's to you.  Orchestrate this shit.  All right.  Why don't we...  We will absolutely pump it up, though.  Don't you worry.  All right.  Why don't we...  How do you want to do this?  I see you got the screen up.  Yes.  We got the screen up.  We're all set.  Why don't you play the jingle and I'll bring our bachelors in.  The open or the jingle? 
[02:43:30]  The open.  Let's go with the open.  Yes.  We're a fancy radio show now, Ron.  It's good.  We do production now.  A little production.  A little bit.  Monstrosities and geese.  Now the beauty picks their bees.  Who's the best of the lame?  It's the O-N-Dame.  It's the O-N-Dame.  Dating game.  I like that shit right there.  Here come the bachelors.  I would go one at a time. 
[02:44:00]  Jesus Christ.  The other two guys got to go out.  Denny?  Let's start with...  Let's start with...  Huh?  I want a donut.  You want a donut?  Look at them.  They're special heart donuts from Dunkin' Donuts, I guess, huh?  They're like heart as hell, too.  Bobo has to come in here with donuts now.  That's his thing.  What, Bobo?  Well, they sold them pre-packaged today.  Instead of usually when you'd have them pick out the...  You could pick out the donuts.  That Dunkin' Donuts at that concourse, they were selling them pre-packaged. 
[02:44:30]  The Friday show magic has begun.  Yeah.  Want to run for a touchdown today?  Yeah.  He's going to get a T-day.  Right through that fucking window.  Grab the ball.  Just fucking...  But Jimmy enjoys when high schools do it.  I do.  But however, if the high school did it every Friday, I would hate it.  Oh, shit.  Well, Bobo, are you excited to be part of the dating game?  Yep, I'm excited to be a part of it, and I'm hoping I win, and I'm hoping it leads to 
[02:45:00]  a great relationship.  Oh, shit.  There we go.  Open heart.  Fuck.  Oh, boy.  That's an open heart.  But just like the kid running for a touchdown, maybe Lexi Love goes, you know what?  I got to let him do this.  Got to.  So everyone can feel good about it.  I think you make a good boyfriend.  Yeah.  I'm pulling for him.  Yeah, I talked to Lexi a bit on Twitter.  She's a nice person.  All right, see, that's going to ruin it.  That's going to ruin it.  Sympathy sex.  No, not at all.  He does great on Twitter.  Right. 
[02:45:30]  All right.  So you're competing...  Supposedly, all of a sudden, my followers skyrocketed to 58.9K.  Right.  What the heck happened?  Shit.  You became extremely popular overnight.  All of a sudden, I know some followers, but they're all in, like, have wording in Russia.  I don't...  What the heck happened?  Am I all of a sudden popular in Russia all of a sudden?  Yeah, the show is syndicated.  Should I just all of a sudden go to Brighton Beach and all of a sudden they recognize me  in Brighton Beach?  Well, I have a conversation.  All of a sudden, there's a lot of Russians who recognize me in Brighton Beach. 
[02:46:00]  Bobo, maybe one of those YouTube videos.  When they go viral in these other countries, all of a sudden, you can pick up some new people.  I bet you that's what happened.  Yep, then if that's the case, then there'll be a lot of screaming women in languages I  can't understand over in Brighton Beach, as I said.  Brighton Beach.  Brighton Beach.  All right, so thank you, Sam.  That was amazing.  All right.  Who kid's trying to...  Bobo has 10,000 more followers in the ONA show, by the way, so... 
[02:46:30]  What the fuck?  It's a pancake.  I see it's a pancake.  Look, by the way, can you show who kid these fucking horrible asses on the cover of Sports  Illustrated?  I thought we'd bounce nice.  All right, Sam, who's next?  Bachelor number two.  Hey now, good morning, everybody.  Oh, shit.  God damn it.  Serious?  You're not into this either, are you?  No, I'm into it, but come on.  All right.  Happy Valentine's Day. 
[02:47:00]  W-S-A-M-E.  Ron is over there reading the sports things.  I don't blame it.  Why?  You're not up for the...  No, I'm loving it.  I don't blame it.  Capricative redundancy.  He has no responsibility to this.  I did fucking radio in the 80s, too.  So this is all great.  Denny is an old school radio guy.  He thinks we're doing things wrong here on the OPN Anthony channel.  What should we be doing for Valentine's Day?  What are some of the traditional things?  You might want to say anything but a day to day.  Right, radio. 
[02:47:30]  Well, maybe playing some of the popular love songs, you know, from the past 25 years.  Taking love song dedications from listeners to send them out to their special someone.  Also, maybe coming up with different things to do on Valentine's Day and night.  After all, this is a Valentine's weekend, three days.  So there's lots of love all weekend long.  Listening to OPN Anthony.  What about the people that don't have anyone?  Well, maybe they'll find love.  They could find love. 
[02:48:00]  On a weekend like this.  There's a lot of singles dances.  And if you need a DJ for those singles dances.  I'm available to drop the beats.  Does this just give you nightmares?  His Instagram is a little more depressing than it is.  Yes, it is.  Oh, what?  Oh, jeez.  I forgot to mention that they probably give out gift cards to florists.  What about Brighton Beach?  Do you get any followers over there?  I don't know.  Supposedly, I might end up with all the where I see me followers are from. 
[02:48:30]  And I said there's a lot of Russian wording on the Twitter bios of some of these followers.  I haven't been keeping track of them.  Just enjoy the fact that you're very famous right now.  Yep.  All right.  Just go with it.  Just a yoin' it.  And you're famous because of what observations like you just gave us.  Flower shops on Valentine's Day.  That's very good.  Smart nigga, man.  He really is.  Danny?  And just also, a lot of the delivery people that are out today.  Yeah.  You know, it's a little tough out there on the snow, so make sure if you do receive flowers 
[02:49:00]  or if you do receive a gift, make sure you tip.  Make sure you tip that person.  All right.  Make sure you take care of that delivery guy who's out there working all day in this cold  weather.  It's the way to be nice.  It's a day of love.  I just fucked in a car.  Fucking serious?  Danny loves his radio.  He should hate radio more than anyone because he's never got the big gig.  Oh, for real?  Danny, you never got the big gig, did you? 
[02:49:30]  Don't stop believing.  Don't stop believing.  All right.  Shit.  He's literally being fucking dead.  He's a soldier.  He's a soldier for SiriusX7.  They don't care about him.  Okay.  They don't give a fuck.  Yeah.  And our surprise bachelor.  Oh, shit.  Bachelor number three.  And me and Jimmy guessed it, and I couldn't be happier.  We welcome Oscar back to the Opie and Anthony show.  How's it going?  How you guys doing?  What's up, Oscar? 
[02:50:00]  I know.  It's been a while.  Yeah.  You all right?  You guys look great.  You guys look great.  Thank you, Oscar.  What the fuck?  He's one of my favorites that has ever come through the organization.  What have you been up to, Oscar?  Oh, well, lately, well, this past year and a half, I've been working for post-production.  We, Moondog Edit.  It's down here, 25th.  We edit commercials.  Boo-boo.  Yeah.  So I'm an assistant video editor, and I just do the commercial, Victoria's Secret, Neutrogena.  Really? 
[02:50:30]  Hell yeah.  And we do short and long-form film.  Hell yeah.  Yeah, it's a great place, man.  I love the people, everybody.  So, yeah, it's fun.  Except for the one assistant that I just don't get along with.  The what?  Oh, no, it's just this right.  Except for the one assistant that he doesn't get along with.  Oh, really?  Maybe you shouldn't say that.  Oh, no, no.  It's all right.  It's all right.  We get along.  We get along.  We get along.  But you just said you didn't.  Yeah, no.  Well, I just, you know what?  I just, you learn how to work with people.  Just, you know, sometimes you just don't agree the format and the way they interact with other people. 
[02:51:00]  But it's all good.  I ain't go front.  I like that Neutrogena shit.  Hell yeah.  You got a lady in your life there, Oscar?  Sorry?  You got a lady?  It's Valentine's Day.  No, well, no.  I just, I was in a very serious relationship last year.  But you know how it is.  It's just, it's hard to keep up, man.  You can't please women, man.  Why?  What happened?  Yeah, I mean, you know, you do them good, right?  What do you mean do them good?  Yeah, just please them.  What do you mean?  Fuck the shit out of them.  Physically, right?  And then after that, you go and take them out of a restaurant. 
[02:51:30]  Right.  And then it's just not good enough.  Yeah.  And then after that, it's just.  Wait, you were good in the bed with this woman?  Yeah, yeah.  It was a workout, man.  Why was it a workout?  Oh, man, I just have to go in there and just 110%, man.  I have to give it everything.  Shit.  In what way?  Do you have any tricks?  Oh, no.  Just, you know, plain old, regular, you know, doggy, little missionary, reverse cowgirl.  Right.  Yeah, you know, I mean, I'll get too crazy.  It's just the stamina and you just keep in focus. 
[02:52:00]  Right.  Absolutely.  So she was all right with that, but she wasn't all right with your restaurant choices?  No, well, see, this is the thing.  Yeah.  I like to take girls to a nice Irish pub.  I like Guinness.  Being an Irish guy like yourself.  Oh, yeah.  Actually, I feel like it's my adoptive heritage.  I don't know.  He doesn't look Irish.  I love Irish women, man.  I think they're pretty.  Like, when they're petite, Bernat, you know, blue eyes.  Love them, man.  I think he's a good woman.  Bernat, blue eyes.  Yeah.  Awkward.  He doesn't look Irish.  I don't know.  Is it me?  I don't know.  He's Irish.  He is?  Yeah, yeah.  I thought he was supposed to be orange. 
[02:52:30]  He's, you know, that dark Irish.  Oh, hell yeah.  There's a few dark Irish.  Black Irish.  Black Irish.  Thank you, Ronnie.  Sorry.  I'm hoping he wins.  You are?  Yeah, I'm hoping for him.  I love Oscar.  Yeah.  So what?  She didn't like what restaurant?  Oh, no.  You're shaking me, all right?  I tend to go to the...  What's up?  You all right?  You're shaking?  Yeah, I'm fine.  Oh, no, I'm fine.  Yeah, just...  Yeah, I'm good.  Fucking coffee.  Fuck, uh...  What?  Oh, no.  Sorry, man.  I'm easily distracted, so... 
[02:53:00]  We never noticed that before.  Yeah, all right.  Go ahead.  So tell us how it broke up, then.  Oh, no.  You know what?  I'll be honest with you, man.  It's just...  I work heavy hours, man.  And, you know, the problem is that on the weekends, you know, I work and shit.  Hell yeah.  So, and then sometimes I don't get back, I don't call back, because I forget sometimes,  or sometimes I don't want to talk to anybody, right?  So, yeah, and then I get up this email on Sunday.  Yeah!  Yeah, and it was...  Yeah, it was... 
[02:53:30]  Yeah, I know.  It was my fault.  All right, cool.  It was just breaking...  The email was what?  Why haven't you called me in the last two days?  Exactly.  I was changing.  I was like, fuck, I'm the same person.  I just work hard, man.  I'm like...  Yeah, sometimes I don't call or text.  It's my fault.  So, you know.  But she's an awesome girl.  You know, we're still friends.  Kind of.  All right, so maybe you find love today.  Oh, hey.  Let's get it on.  That's happiness.  Bobo, anything before we bring in the girl?  Well, me, as you know, I'm a single. 
[02:54:00]  Haven't had a girlfriend since age 19.  Shit.  And I'm a virgin.  It's fucked up, man.  But I didn't even...  I am a...  You didn't even have a...  I am a fine person, and as I said, I do...  Right.  I do help out.  Like, anything, like, a girl would ask me for.  If she asked...  If she needed help carrying her bags or luggage, I would be willing to help carry that luggage.  Hell yeah.  And she needed help with the food shopping, I would do that. 
[02:54:30]  I would help her with whatever she needed help with.  But...  Ron, I don't blame you if you want to leave.  I don't blame you at all.  And I...  Would you blame me?  I'd even...  If she's sad for whatever reason, I would be there, all right?  Yeah.  All right.  I'd be there as long as they're also...  But did you have a girlfriend?  You didn't really have a girlfriend at 19.  Yeah, I sort of did, but I left...  I left her when she became too much threatening to my family. 
[02:55:00]  What is that about?  She was very threatening.  This was back before...  I didn't have a cell phone back then.  Right.  So if I wasn't home, she'd call.  Right.  And sometimes she would blame it on my mother or whoever answered the phone for me not being  home when...  But why was she threatening to your family?  She would be...  She got bitter if she couldn't talk to me.  But would she, like, threaten your family?  Threaten or just...  No, like... 
[02:55:30]  Just say shit?  Yeah, she would think it's her fault.  Like, why'd you send them here?  Why'd you need this?  Why'd you need that?  Why'd you have to be sick?  Why'd you need your prescription filled?  Why were you not sick?  Why'd you have to be sick?  You should give some more examples.  Just one more example, please.  Shit.  I'm just going to use another example.  What?  You're a fool that Daniel had a doctor's appointment. 
[02:56:00]  Whatever the situation was that I was not home, she would blame it on my mother.  She couldn't put up with all your penis surgeries?  No, I hadn't.  The last time I had a surgery like that was age 15.  Right.  That it was that bad that I needed a surgery.  How many surgeries total for Ron?  48.  48 penis surgeries.  They messed up an operation.  That's a world record.  Wow.  They messed up an operation when I was little.  Urinary system.  It wasn't a thing that wasn't that big of a deal, but... 
[02:56:30]  Can we get you in the Guinness Book of World Records?  I truly believe that's a world record.  I don't think there's anyone that has had their penis operated on more than 48 times.  I don't even see it.  What could be left of it?  That one little operation got messed up.  Right.  It was problems with my urinary system.  Other than that, my penis function's fine.  Why does his voice do that, Sam?  If he don't mind peeing blood.  Right.  No, I don't pee blood unless there's an infection.  Okay.  Unless there's an infection. 
[02:57:00]  It would have to be an infection.  Gotcha.  Good.  As long as I'm drinking a lot of fluids.  This is the breakfast hour, though.  Thanks, Danny.  How's your penis, Danny?  You all right?  Everything's good.  You all right down there?  Can I get a drop-in, though, for Sirius XM Love at 9 o'clock on Channel 17?  It becomes Valentine's Day Radio, hosted by Michael Bolton.  Michael Bolton is going to be here playing love songs.  Is he actually here, or did he tape it in August? 
[02:57:30]  Michael Bolton is here.  He's down there in the Valentine's Day Radio studio.  Yeah.  He's here live, is he?  Maybe Ronnie would like to take a picture with Mr. Bolton.  Love that shirt.  That would be amazing for everybody.  Was that a cricket?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Sam, this is going great so far, I've got to be honest.  Well, are you ready to meet our girl?  I'm just very happy that Oscar's here.  I could just talk to Oscar for an hour.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's Irish, too.  You still drinking a lot, Oscar?  Oh, hell yeah. 
[02:58:00]  Dude, I love it, man.  I mean, it's great, man.  I have no problem with it, man.  Yeah.  No, because I'm a responsible individual.  I mean, I show up to work.  I do my work.  I work hard.  Right.  And at night, I just go, Dan and I, we go out, we party, we drink, and you know, always  good times.  And he, uh...  Oh, no, not on that.  Not on that anymore.  No, I've been listening to a lot of reggae music lately, though.  Really?  Yeah.  A little of this.  Oh, oh, you know what?  Occasionally, man.  Welcome.  Get the fuck out of here, man.  Serious? 
[02:58:30]  Yeah.  I can't imagine the cab driver is saying when he's...  What?  What?  What?  Why's the man throwing up in my cab?  What?  What happened just now?  I was imitating a Jamaican guy complaining.  Oh, that was good, Dan.  That makes the fuck out of here.  Thank you for explaining.  The man throwing up in my cab.  Now it's funny.  Hold on.  Is there a Jamaican in here?  I hope it ain't me.  That fucking freaked me out.  I thought a Jamaican came into the room.  I hope it's not me. 
[02:59:00]  Holy shit.  I hope it's one of the same guys that got to fucking Peter Tosh.  How much do you drink at night, Oscar?  Oh, I can do in one night.  I do 14 pints of Guinness.  Jesus.  14 pints of Guinness in one night?  Hell yeah.  I do spend one and a half hours, two hours.  Two hours?  Hell yeah.  I still socialize, man.  And then you go to work the next day.  No problem.  Hell yeah.  As long as I get on that 706 train from Jersey, I'm good, man.  I'll just take a nice little nap and then I'll just walk to work. 
[02:59:30]  Fucking you.  Yeah, we'll just continue.  Fucking youth.  How the fuck do you do that?  What's the thing with Irish guys?  They like black chicks.  I don't know.  You ever had a black chick before?  Yeah.  Yeah.  A couple.  Hell yeah.  What happened?  Ask them.  That was great, man.  You fucked the shit out of her?  Well, yeah.  Well, one was she was very Christian, right?  A Christian black girl?  Yeah.  They're out there?  That's rare.  Hell yeah.  I think that's very rare.  We had pizza afterwards.  Pizza?  Oh.  You guys heard about that?  You know about the saying about the sexist? 
[03:00:00]  Sex and pizza?  You know, when it's good, it's good.  When it's bad, it's still pretty good.  Oh, shit.  What the fuck?  We gotta get him an open mic.  The Irish are considered the blacks of Europe.  Oh, wow.  Oh, okay.  That's why they identify.  What happened?  Did she?  Was she asking you to start T-bowing when you went down on her?  Holy shit.  Did a Jamaican just come back in here?  That fucking freaked me.  Is it Snoop Lion?  Was she asking you to constantly be T-bowing when you went down on her? 
[03:00:30]  That's where my mom shops for us.  What, Bobo?  Because he said that girl was religious.  Right.  I was saying if he was, if that girl was constantly asking him to be T-bowing when he went down  on her.  Hmm.  Okay.  God, I don't understand that question, please.  Michael Thumpert, Tim Tebow, Michael Thumpert.  All right.  You don't have to explain Tim Tebow to everybody.  Jesus.  We're good, man.  We're good.  This guy got Michael Bolton on his phone.  What a loser. 
[03:01:00]  Is he really here?  No.  Michael Bolton is on Valentine's Day Radio.  Why can't you admit he taped that shit in August?  It's the theater of the mind.  Yeah, but we're not the theater of the mind.  He didn't tape it in August.  When did he tape it?  He didn't tape it in August.  That's all I'm saying.  Thanksgiving?  No.  Thanksgiving weekend?  No, no, no.  Long weekend.  He came by.  Did it for everybody?  No.  He's hosting right now.  I'll get Michael Bolton.  What studio?  I'll go down there right now.  The Valentine's Day Radio Studio, right down the hall. 
[03:01:30]  It's decorated with hearts and flowers and chocolates.  He taped it ten days ago.  Thanks for a real answer, Travis.  I'm just trying to give you a little...  Thank you.  I'm just trying to give you how radio should be and how radio works.  None of the celebrities are here on the day they say they're here.  They take it way in advance.  Enough already.  Like Katy Perry's hanging out on the 4th of July.  Really?  It's like she has nowhere else to go.  I'm spending the weekend doing the same Hits 1 show over and over and over and over again.  Right.  All right.  Okay.  Let's bring in Lexi Love. 
[03:02:00]  Oh, shit.  White pussy.  Yes.  She got that fat ass, too.  Lexi.  I got naked photos of her.  Lexi Love.  Good.  Welcome back.  Hi, Lexi.  Thank you.  You know Ron Bennington?  Nice to see you, Lexi.  Thank you.  I like you're all...  You're dressed apart today.  Thank you.  It's Valentine's Day.  Yes, it is.  Happy Valentine's Day, everybody.  You too.  She needs headphones.  You want headphones?  Yeah.  And just move into the mic like it's a...  Okay.  Like it's a microphone. 
[03:02:30]  James, you got red panties on.  You got the red panties on for today.  I just saw it.  Look at you.  Hey, my dick just moved.  Yeah.  Got a match.  We got three great guys behind that screen.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  You guys really hit them well today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're behind that.  If you were smart, you'd start shooting through that screen.  I'm a freaking shot.  Anybody got a gun?  We'll make it a bloody Valentine's Day. 
[03:03:00]  There you go.  Should we break before the festivities?  Yeah.  Let people really strap in.  Let them digest what they heard.  Yeah.  The gold already.  Too much in a row is no good.  Let them run to the bathroom finally because they can't leave the radio while this is on.  Yeah.  Disappointment radio.  Why don't you guys...  Yeah.  It's like when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon.  Right.  You know what I mean?  It's really the excitement building up to it.  Sure.  Sure.  Who will she pick? 
[03:03:30]  All right.  I think we're going to take a break.  We could just say pick a number between one and three.  Exactly.  And you can't choose zero as tempting as that would be.  Zero means you date all three of them.  Lexi, you're actually going to go out on a date with one of these gentlemen?  I am.  I'm really wondering who's behind the curtain.  Would you give him a little something something?  I'll just say this.  Are you a Michael Bolton fan?  Some music artist, right?  Yeah. 
[03:04:00]  That's a good answer like that.  Fuck Michael Bolton and his dumb love songs.  Who cares?  Right, Danny, you're with me.  I like Michael Bolton's music.  It's very good.  A lot of good songs.  And he's a great songwriter.  I'll have you know he wrote a great song for Kiss, right, Jimmy?  What the fuck?  What was the Kiss song?  I didn't know that.  Yeah, he did.  Forever.  I didn't know that.  Yeah, it was a big comeback song for them in the late 1980s.  He also wrote a great comeback song for Cher.  I found someone. 
[03:04:30]  Kind of interesting that Cher and one of the members of Kiss also had a little relationship  there.  Yes, I know.  These are the stories behind the hits.  She also has a kid, I think, with Greg Allman.  Is he here or did he voice track this bit?  This is something he did back in August.  By the way, I want to strangle Troy Kwan for telling me that this was a sponsored bit.  Oh, no.  Because I'm like, well, I have to show up for it if there's a sponsor.  Oh, yeah, no, there's no sponsor.  I thought there was sponsors involved.  I heard there was a sponsor, too.  Believe me, I would have been a fucking, I would have called up at, like, fucking fun. 
[03:05:00]  No, this bit is brought to you by Jim Norton in Atlantic City this weekend.  Oh, shit.  You know what?  No, it's not.  It's fucking Atlantic City.  And, I mean, I'm behind you, Jim.  How could you not want to come in today?  No, I like seeing you, Lexi.  Oh, Lexi Love.  That's nice.  You know, we're going to play this out, goddammit.  Yes.  I do like Lexi Love.  I've got the bitch crying now.  Huh?  Yeah, I've got bitches crying up here.  All right, we're going to take a quick break, and then we're going to get to the

You've got to make it your own.  They're specific to this dating game.  Exactly.  I just got caught looking up Lexi loves to dress. 
[03:11:00]  I apologize, Lexi.  I'm telling you, man.  Red panties.  The best part was, she goes,  oh, you really can see them.  Oh, but what?  Oh, yeah, you can.  Yeah, you can.  They're nice, too.  Is there a brand?  Is there a name brand on those?  There is.  What is it?  Victoria's Secret.  Hey.  It's the only company, right?  I can see that pussy, too.  Can you?  Yeah, look, look, look, look.  You don't see it?  It's a boy. 
[03:11:30]  I can see the head.  Jesus.  Get out of there.  All right, we got Oscar.  For the first time on our show in probably like two years.  It's good to know he's still parting his ass off.  How long since you've been here?  How long?  It's probably a couple of years.  Yeah, January 2012.  Oh, okay.  Oh, no, before that.  No, 11, yeah.  You sure?  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  He's very excited, huh?  What's up?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:12:00]  The Oscars, remember?  With the Oscars.  Oh, it was a promo thing.  What's up, yeah?  Anyways, well.  What's the gift?  This guy's crazy, man.  She's going to ask a question, right?  He's the most nervous guy alive.  I fucking love Oscar.  Yeah, so Lexi's going to ask you guys questions,  and then she's going to quickly, you know, pick somebody,  and then we're going to move on with our fucking radio show.  Yes.  Okay?  Is that all right with you guys?  Oh, yeah. 
[03:12:30]  Denny, you ready?  I'm ready, baby.  Let's rock and roll.  And Bobo.  I'm ready.  Let's do this.  What the fuck?  All right, so we can start asking questions.  Yes.  Let's go to Lexi Love with a question for all three bachelors.  Oh, okay.  So, my sexy guys, describe a romantic date to me.  Who wants to start?  Number three, sure.  Yeah, romantic date.  I'm going to take you to a nice little local Italian restaurant. 
[03:13:00]  I'm going to sit down, have some good food.  Have 14 pints of Guinness.  I'm going to get a fucking doggy style.  No, I just have to elude the situation because I'm more flexible  and I settle a little more.  So, yeah, we'll just talk about life, things, and goals, aspirations.  Will you order for her?  What's up?  Will you order for her?  Will you be drinking a lot?  Are you going to smoke a little weed before?  No, no, I can't do that because then I won't be able to talk. 
[03:13:30]  Can you please, you and the other two contestants, engage in a little bit of that?  No, no, no, no.  If this was a fight, we'd stop it.  It got up to such a rough start.  All right, so an Italian restaurant.  Oh, yeah, and then a nice little walk.  A walk?  Yeah, a nice little walk, just locally.  They have walks in Japanese restaurants.  But, baby, it's cold outside.  Oh, very good.  I like how you fucking worked that in.  Nice. 
[03:14:00]  She's saying it's cold outside, so explain what you would do.  Jeez, all right.  God damn it.  Yeah, restaurant.  Restaurant, good.  Maybe go check out a nice cool little show or something.  There's a lot of cool venues.  Jazz.  Hell yeah.  A couple more drinks.  Jazz?  A couple more drinks.  Yeah.  He goes, he goes, jazz.  Hell yeah.  You like a good jazz band, do you?  Yeah.  Well, I mean, because it sounds good in the background, so, I mean.  Just insulted every jazz musician. 
[03:14:30]  They never want to hear that it sounds good in the background.  It's like, fucking elevator music.  Fuck yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  That'll go-karts.  Yeah.  Why not?  Go-karts.  Go-karts.  It'll be exciting.  You know, get the blood going.  Hell yeah.  Either some nice jazz music or go-karts.  A few years back, I did that.  I just got piss drunk and went to this place out in, what was it?  Mayflower, New Jersey?  Someplace.  Oh, man.  It was the best experience of my life, man.  Just buzz, man.  Out of your mind.  I had, like, a nice record for the fastest, like, chunky guy there, man. 
[03:15:00]  You know, because I'm on 270 pounds.  Right.  Right?  Like, old muscle.  So, you actually got the record for fastest chunky guy.  Hell yeah.  Yeah.  I was, like, number two, man.  At the go-kart place.  You know, if every answer is this in-depth, we may never end this game.  Which is fine.  Oh, yeah.  Well, I should just move to the next side then.  Well, I think you forgot that you're in the dating game, and now you're just sharing info to us.  Oh, okay.  Well, anyways.  Wait, Alexa, right? 
[03:15:30]  Lexi.  Oh, Lexi.  Alexa.  Yeah, no, anyways.  We'll go out for a nice little chill time, restaurant, some wine, and hell yeah.  Maybe a movie.  Maybe.  All right.  Let's move on to Danny.  I was thinking of maybe going to Applebee's.  They have that great two-for-20 special.  Two nice meals.  They always have a nice jukebox of music.  Actually, a Muzak system in the background.  And it's always fun to play music trivia, because if there's something I love, it's just music trivia.  Like, name that tune.  I get a little artist information.  What do you do? 
[03:16:00]  Name that tune at Applebee's.  Oh, yeah.  They have trivia nights.  I work there.  I'm just doing a trivia night.  Of course you work there.  Yeah.  I've worked there many times.  Also, during Monday night football, between the games, between the breaks, I would do  some trivia.  How many times have you thought of killing yourself?  Are you asking me?  I just think it would be a nice compact day, pick you up in the minivan, and we go out and  have some fun.  He's economical.  You know what I'm saying?  All right.  Cheap nigga.  Bobo, too busy checking his Twitter.  Jesus, Bobo.  Throw your phone away, please. 
[03:16:30]  No, I didn't know how long it would take to get to me, but first off, since it is winter,  I would take Alexi to a Rangers game, the garden.  I would get her whatever she wanted to eat.  You name it, I'd get it for her, and to be, because I'm extra nice, I would actually get  up and get the food for her, and she wouldn't have to leave her seat.  Oh. 
[03:17:00]  I would actually get up and get the food for her.  That's the fuck out of here.  Why the gentleman?  That's some solid shit right there.  I would also make sure she's conscious.  I know she, I know she has.  That's her first mistake.  She has to decide that she needs to eat stuff that's gluten-free.  I would be especially conscientious about that.  You're going to get gluten-free shit at Madison Square Garden?  They have everything you could think of.  Have you seen how they changed the menu at the garden?  No, I haven't been there yet.  Same thing at Citi Field. 
[03:17:30]  It's like, you name it.  Sometimes I took people to James, they couldn't make up their mind what they wanted to eat because  of the food options.  Right, okay.  It's called tequila and popcorn, actually.  Nice.  Is that good enough for the first question, Lexi?  I think so.  All right, who are you going to pick for your date?  I don't know.  We have drunken go-karts.  All right.  We're in movie.  What's the next question?  Okay, the next question. 
[03:18:00]  Bachelor number two.  Everyone has a secret fetish.  What's your favorite fetish and sexual position?  Yipes.  Well, I'm a stand-up guy.  I like to broadcast standing up, so I think my position would be standing up.  And my fetish is just going to Disney World.  I could go to Disney World 365 days a year.  So are we doing, like, standing doggy?  Are you just standing there and whacking it?  Like, what are you doing while you're standing up? 
[03:18:30]  He's describing what he does at Disney World.  Well, I think we'd start off with a slow dance to maybe one of the popular love songs.  Oh, Jesus.  And then take it from there.  I'm a traditional guy.  You really like Disneyland or World that much?  Oh, yeah.  Disney World is the best place to go.  It's not that great that you'd have to go that many times.  Oh, yeah.  It's a lot of fun.  There's so many rides.  I like the Country Bears.  Don't you like the Country Bears when they come down and they start singing?  I mean, it's just a lot of fun. 
[03:19:00]  This guy's a little sick for me, man.  Yeah.  All right.  Who do you want to ask next?  Bachelor number three.  They say love conquers all.  Wait, I want to know Oscar's sexual position and his secret fetish thing.  Okay.  Oh, all right.  Well, I pretty much really enjoyed When a Girl Bites My Shoulders.  It is.  Wow.  Why the shoulders?  I don't know.  I get being bitten, but why the shoulders? 
[03:19:30]  No, that's like my sensitive area.  Oh, okay.  Like on your collarbone or by your neck or like the actual neck?  That's great.  You discovered that while you were fucking, what, burping an entrance?  Right.  It helps.  That's where his nipples are.  You like when girls bite your shoulders.  Yeah, yeah.  That gets you going.  In this area where collarbone, yeah.  Yeah.  You're going to have to bite his shoulders.  You know that, right, Lexi?  Like, urgh, animal.  How hard?  Oh, medium.  Medium bite.  Medium bite.  I don't need to be marks.  Medium bite. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah, marks don't mind them.  Like, they're like battle wounds or just...  A metal wound.  Yeah.  A medium bite.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, all right.  All right.  So that's your fetish.  Yeah, well, yeah, yeah.  Any other fetishes?  Uh, man.  No, no.  I think that's it.  That's a...  Okay.  Yeah.  And what's your favorite sexual position?  Yes, right?  Oh, oh, oh, the...  It's like a T-formation.  I lay down straight, and then you kind of just...  You become the T-part.  Now, do you like to do that position in front of the mirror so you can see all the goodies? 
[03:20:30]  Oh, hell yeah.  Oh, my God.  I'd love to.  Hell yeah.  I have a big mirror in my room, too.  Is it on the ceiling?  I can drill it up there.  There's no problem.  You can throw it up there in a second if you can.  Oh, yeah.  Let's you love, right?  Well, do you tell me?  Give me a...  Yeah, okay.  All right.  Very good.  Got it.  And, uh, Bobo.  Oh, you're in?  Me, I have a secret voice fetish. 
[03:21:00]  Like, I don't know why certain accents I find attractive.  Jamaican.  I don't know.  Just various voices.  Like, I don't know.  Like, let's see here.  Her voice is just, for some reason, that attractive that it just...  That's not a sex...  A secret voice.  It's a regular female voice.  Sometimes there are certain accents I find a...  Like what?  I find attractive.  Like, for some reason, sometimes Brooklyn, I notice, sometimes has an attractive accent.  Sure, yeah.  Everybody likes a Brooklyn chick. 
[03:21:30]  I don't know why.  I noticed...  Jesus.  I noticed certain parts of Pennsylvania seem to have...  Seem to have an attractive accent.  Those aren't secret voices.  Those are accents.  Well, accents, right?  I have an accent fetish.  An accent fetish.  Bobo, do you want to go get a hoagie?  Hey, they see his dick.  What's going on down there?  What are you doing down there, honey?  Honey, come into the house and get some water.  Water.  Water ice.  Water ice.  We're getting a water ice.  Water ice.  Fire plugs.  What accent is Lexi Love? 
[03:22:00]  I don't know.  She has an accent?  She's like West Coast-ish.  West Coast accent?  I don't know.  Where are you from originally?  Boston.  I don't hear Boston, though.  Hey, I've lived a lot of places.  What part of Boston?  I'm from Gloucester, actually.  Nice.  Yeah.  And he's Boston.  Right.  Denny is tapped out.  He's got to make sure Michael Bolton is doing okay.  He's going to go check on Michael Bolton.  What happened? 
[03:22:30]  Bolton shit his pants.  I guess so.  What happened to Denny?  He started panicking.  He said, I gotta go.  I gotta go.  But what about?  I don't know.  Did one of our bachelors take off?  Yeah.  What?  Did he get in trouble?  He'll be back.  Is he married?  But we don't even know anything about Denny.  I think he's married, but I don't know if they're...  I'm not going to...  Dude, dude.  I'm not going to spread his business out there.  Well, what do you know?  He's in the...  He's applicable for the dating game.  Are they not doing well?  I believe he's applicable for the dating game. 
[03:23:00]  Because she left him for a man of color?  So he just bailed on this?  No, he'll be back.  No, that's why you got a good boy phone and a naughty boy phone.  Naughty boy phone and a good boy phone.  I'm sure Jimmy appreciates you doing his bit so terrifically.  I don't mind.  All together, it's gone.  Got to keep those ho-phones and those bro-phones separated.  All right.  Let's move on to the next question, please.  So, which bachelor left?  Which number? 
[03:23:30]  Two.  You only got Oscar and Bobo, so you can say them by name.  Okay.  So, bachelor number three.  They say love conquers all.  Would you ever date someone outside of your age range?  Even if, technically, it was illegal?  Oh, man.  That's a hard question.  Why is it a hard question?  Let me simplify it.  Do you get hard thinking?  Would you fuck a child?  No, because... 
[03:24:00]  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Yes, Oscar.  I mean, there's been some great books written on this subject.  No, I can't.  I can't do it.  It's called porn.  What are some of the great books written on this subject?  No, no.  I mean, every time I walk in Barnes & Noble, I just see a lot of them.  I'm for it in love.  So, yeah.  I mean, I haven't read any of them.  So, I just...  I know they exist.  So, why do you know there are great books written on this subject?  Oh, no.  I don't see great books.  Oh, did I?  Yeah.  Other than Lolita, it's fucking kiddie porn.  Okay.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:24:30]  You got one.  Yeah, no.  I'm willing to go older.  Like, 80.  80?  Yeah, I'll do 80.  No, but she said, like, borderline.  So, you're talking, let's say...  I don't know.  What's the age of consent in New York?  Oh, I don't know.  Yeah.  What, is it 17?  Is it 17, let's say?  So, a 16-year-old.  16.  Oh, man.  I mean, 30...  I'm going to be 30 this year.  Yeah.  So, I don't think I can pull that off.  See, I'm 45, and I would.  Man, that's...  Maybe in other countries, man.  It's like, I don't know.  I mean, it's...  Right?  You would do it in all the... 
[03:25:00]  If it's legalism.  Yeah.  Well, if it's love, I wouldn't call it...  Yeah, just making love.  It's love.  Yeah.  Making love.  Yeah, no, because, I mean, I think brands have, I think it's like 15, 14.  Is that what the...  The fact that you know that is a bad thing.  That's crazy.  You know, you're up against Bobo.  This is yours to lose.  Exactly.  You've pretty much not said anything and have won this.  This is the one answer that just brought Bobo back into the game.  Bobo wins.  He's going to walk right into the front zone, man. 
[03:25:30]  This is a teeter-totter, I mean.  All right.  So, you're open, depending on the circumstances.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'd definitely do a lot older, though.  I mean...  All right.  What's the oldest you would do?  80.  You'd go 80.  A lot of money.  Thank God.  Maybe she's about to die.  What's the oldest you've done?  Ah, man.  Oldest?  No, I don't think I've...  Oh, like two years.  Two?  Yeah, that's about...  Two years old?  I'll be two years older than I am.  I was about to say, man.  I apologize for that.  I didn't mean it.  Call the fucking cops.  I'm not a burp.  I'm not creepy. 
[03:26:00]  I'm not...  Well, you did say two.  No, no.  You did say two.  Alexi, right?  Alexi?  Alexi.  Alexi, I'm sorry.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  So, yeah, I mean...  Yeah, law can conquer all.  So, yeah.  Hell yeah.  Okay.  Let's just get it on.  All right.  Bob, out to you.  We've got to make a decision soon.  Well, when it goes age-wise older, I've seen some women that are what I call a young 50.  Are you saying that 50 is old? 
[03:26:30]  No, I'm saying that they look like they're in their 20s.  Like, they still look extremely attractive.  I want their plastic surgeon's phone number.  Right.  But that wasn't the question.  How young would you go?  Oh, young?  I would go 16, and I would take a car drive-in, drive to a nice hotel in North Carolina.  Is it legal down there?  Is that why you would go there?  How do so many people know the fucking laws?  I don't know.  It's scary, isn't it?  Are we live? 
[03:27:00]  This kid doesn't know how to tie his own shoe, but he knows the sex laws.  It's called the internet.  Oh.  All right.  Do we have one final question?  A good question, Sam?  Yes.  I don't want any of the good questions to be wasted.  Oh, man.  All right.  Well, I kind of want to have one for number three and then the final question.  Okay.  Okay.  Hang on.  Okay.  Oh, man.  Which one first?  Okay.  Bachelor number three.  Who's three again?  Oscar.  Oh, good.  I like a guy who's quick on his feet as quickly as you can possibly can. 
[03:27:30]  Name every condiment you can think of.  Quick, Oscar.  All right.  Pepper, cumin, rosemary, cinnamon, salt, pepper, of course, ketchup, mustard, honey mustard,  ginger on mustard.  Different kinds of mustards.  Yeah.  They all fall into the umbrella of mustard.  The pasta sauce.  Frank's red hot sauce.  Three seconds. 
[03:28:00]  Three seconds.  Three seconds.  Olive oil, vinegar.  Come.  How's it going?  Beer.  I know.  I can use that as condiment.  Yeah.  Beer.  Oh, milk.  No.  Gosh.  Yeah.  Well, you.  No, I can't think of more.  I can't.  Just can't.  Half and half, motherfucker.  Pepper flakes.  Pepper flakes.  Pepper flakes.  Yeah.  Onion powder. 
[03:28:30]  Onion powder.  Oh, wait.  Wait.  How's this beneficial to the...  I want to see how spicy you like this.  Oh, what up here?  You forgot the Zarao show.  Oh, wow.  All right.  Time for you to do the final question.  Yes.  And then Lexi has to pick her mate.  Yes.  Mate?  Mate.  It's the mating game.  Sam, come here for a second.  Terrible.  All right.  Final question.  I need more poetry in my life. 
[03:29:00]  Off the top of your head, come up with a poem about what you like about me.  And my name is Lexi, for you guys who keep forgetting, and what you and I would do together.  Can we find out what happened to Denny?  I'm obsessed with what happened to Denny.  I'll find out while they're answering this question.  Okay.  Or at least bring him back to explain himself?  Yes.  All right.  So what is it?  A poem about Lexi love, right?  Yes.  Right now.  Okay.  A poem off the top of your head.  Start with Bobo.  Lexi, you're very sexy. 
[03:29:30]  Lexi, you'd be the greatest person to be that first time.  Oh, God.  And there isn't anyone I would rather have to be with than you.  It's not a poem.  Sam, explain what a poem is.  It's a rambling beg.  Right.  I mean, we're talking about iambic pentameter, you know?  Right.  So see if you can do it in iambic pentameter.  Like, rhyme something, at least.  Just rhyme something.  Well, Lexi is very sexy.  Nice.  No one would have thought of that one.  I would look, I'm not thinking about rhymes. 
[03:30:00]  I would love to take, to take, take her out.  It'd be, it'd be so, it'd be so crazy.  Now rhyme crazy.  You could do this.  But I, I would not be lazy.  Okay, good.  Good.  I would not be lazy.  Go with lazy now.  What do you got?  What do you got?  And I could tell you, and with Lexi around, no way this guy could be very hazy.  What the hell?  Hey, that's some diddy shit. 
[03:30:30]  Wait, this guy could be very hazy.  Right.  This guy's, you know, he's going at Jay-Z right now.  And I, and I'd love, and I'd love her to even join me when I, when I take my doggies for a walkie.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Okay.  Yeah, he's spitting ill right now.  All right.  He's going in.  Oscar's turn.  All right, and then we're going to find out what happened to Denny after the dating game, right?  Yes.  Okay, Oscar, it's time for a poem to Lexi Love.  Well, Lexi, when I look at you, it's like a goddess. 
[03:31:00]  You're like a goddess.  When I strike your, I strike your hair.  Stroke your hair.  When I strike your hair.  I'm in stroke.  I'm in stroke.  When I caress your skull with a brick.  It's like a beautiful wave.  Like I'm swimming in the ocean.  When I see you walk, it's, it's as beautiful as looking into the moon when it's nice and full.  When I, uh, when you, uh, you hang out with me, I just, I feel like, uh, I'm in complete, uh, uh, state of muse. 
[03:31:30]  And, uh, I just love the way you talk.  Your voice is as sweet as honey.  Watching an angel playing, uh, a harp upon a pillar of honey.  Uh, pillar of honey?  What the fuck is that?  It says pillars of honey out there?  I guess.  I guess it would be.  Wrap it up, dummy.  Anyways.  Check it out.  I also, uh, I'm gonna, I'll write a song for you because I play the guitar. 
[03:32:00]  So, yeah, I would do it like the most beautiful song I ever written.  Get a nice little serenade.  Oh, hell yeah.  Do we have a guitar?  Oh, I don't have one with me.  Fuck.  Why don't we have a guitar in here for Oscar?  Can we get one in one minute?  Yeah, I could, I could, I could get something happening.  Yeah.  I mean.  Can we get a guitar real fast?  Yeah, yeah.  Sal, fast.  Run.  Lexi Love's gotta go.  And we gotta wrap this up.  Where do you have to go, Lexi?  I have to go to another show.  Oscar wants to sing her a song real fast.  And then we can wrap this up. 
[03:32:30]  Can you sing, you can probably sing acapella pretty good.  I could beatbox if you want.  Yeah, can you want to beatbox?  I mean, it's hard for me to sing and play at the same time.  I could beatbox.  Perfect, yeah.  Let's go.  Let's go beatbox.  All right, ready?  Oh, by the way, I just want to plug, I play in a metal band in Queens.  Theonlyweapon.com, just check it out.  We're now recording.  We should have a full length album by May.  What do you do for the band?  What's up?  What do you do for the band?  Oh, I play the guitar, yeah.  Nice.  Hell yeah, I'm taking guitar lessons.  I just want to take my playing to the next level.  So that makes the band happy that you're still taking lessons. 
[03:33:00]  I've been playing like 16 years, though.  But it's just like going back to the theory and just really understanding.  Okay, all right.  All right.  Beatbox, who kidding?  You want me to beatbox?  All right, ready?  Hi, Lexi.  How you doing?  Hey, baby.  Hi.  What's up?  You guys, so are you from around here?  What?  Is he rapping or?  You got to sing.  Yeah.  I can't sing.  Oh, man, I can't.  I can't sing. 
[03:33:30]  I thought you were going to sing.  Oh, you want me to sing?  Sing, motherfucker.  That's why we're doing this.  It's going to be in Spanish, all right?  Okay.  Well, whenever you're ready, motherfucker.  Wait, I'm just trying to remember.  I'm running out of fucking spirit here, he's saying. 
[03:34:00]  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  I think this is the Spanish version of My Nigga.  My Nigga.  I hope so.  I really hope so.  Very good, Oscar.  Very good.  That was amazing.  It really was amazing.  Time for Lexi.  Fuck.  By the way, the lyrics to that were,  Keep Swimming, I See the Lights of Miami. 
[03:34:30]  It's a beautiful song.  I didn't know an Irish guy could do something like that,  so I applaud you, Oscar.  Black Irish.  Black Irish.  You're right.  You're right, Ron.  Nigga Irish.  Before we say goodbye to Lexi, it's time for her to pick her mate.  Right.  Pick that.  Should she talk about the guys as she goes down the list?  Yeah, explain why.  Quick sentence about all three guys, and then pick.  The first guy fell short.  He just came and went so quick. 
[03:35:00]  That's so sad.  Oh, Oscar.  No, no, no, no, no.  I mean, the guy who, like, left.  Oh, Danny.  He's back.  Danny's back.  He's going to explain why he panicked on us after the break.  Okay.  Well, I have to, like, that was my thing about Danny.  So he's out.  He's out.  That's fine.  Can't hang, can't tango, you know?  Right.  Okay.  Can't hango, can't tango.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  And then with Bobo, you know, we're just so close because I'm here all the, I'm here 
[03:35:30]  and I see you a lot and we're friends on Twitter.  You know, I just think that if we take it to the next level, it might just mess things  up.  Oh.  You know?  Uh-oh.  Bobo, comment.  Comment for my guy.  Comment for Bobo.  I am a good person.  I don't think it would mess things up.  I think things might go well.  Things might be better than what's expected.  But I think she stole his dick, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a mistake.  Oscar, you got a big hog? 
[03:36:00]  Hell yeah.  And Oscar, you really got me with that song and who could be boxing for you.  I mean, that's some New York shit.  Is Oscar the winner?  Oscar's the winner.  Come meet Lexi Love.  Get the fuck out of here.  Come meet Lexi Love.  You got it, buddy.  Hey, how are you?  Hey.  Big purple chunky nigga.  Have you ever seen her before?  No, no.  Oh, I saw her in the waiting room there. 
[03:36:30]  Put off.  Yeah.  I guess we didn't need the screen, then.  No, we didn't.  We put all our contestants in the office.  We're going to do this next year, Sam?  Look at that good.  It's going to be an annual event, yes.  Oh, absolutely.  Could you bite his shoulder?  Because that's his thing.  Give it a good bite.  Fuck his medium bite shit.  Oh, yeah.  I feel good.  Oh, yeah.  What does that do?  What does that do?  Goes right to your penis?  You're salty.  Did you shower this morning?  No, no.  What happened?  No, no.  We're already off to a great start. 
[03:37:00]  My skin tastes awful.  What do people without bathing and coming on this show?  What happened was that I just shoveled my walkway.  With your shoulders?  No, not with my shoulders.  I got sweaty.  That's the thing.  I got sweaty.  You got sweaty and shoveling.  Before you've even left the studio, you've fucking completely sexually repulsed your day.  Where are they going, Sam?  Where are they going?  They will be going, all expenses paid, to an early afternoon at Dave & Buster. 
[03:37:30]  Did Oscar's shoulder taste bad?  Did it taste bad?  It's salty.  It could be the cologne.  I'm wearing cologne, too.  Salty cologne.  Exactly.  What is it?  More salt.  Right.  More salt.  Damn it.  You got it.  Fuck.  All right.  We have to say goodbye to Lexi.  All right.  All right.  Well, we get to the audience.  We appreciate you guys.  And we're going to build a date for these two.  We absolutely will.  Oh, I got prizes for the people who are not going on the date.  I brought, they get Lexi Love Squirt Shot Glasses and a copy of Uncle Don's Exotic Interludes, 
[03:38:00]  which is my board name.  Wow.  So then you won't get laid and break the ice later without me.  Yes, every contestant leaves with Turtle Wax.  All right.  Thanks to everybody.  After the break, I want to find out what the fuck happened to Danny White, panic like that.  Danny, I'm disappointed.  You brought my heart on Valentine's Day.  Lexi Love, where can they hear you next?  You're moving on to another radio show.  I'm going to the sports show.  It's Channel 92.  He's new.  Okay.  What's his name?  Patrick.  I don't know.  Dan Patrick? 
[03:38:30]  No.  That'd be amazing.  So that's where I'm going.  Dan Patrick suddenly changes format.  Yeah.  And on the Twitter, it's Lexi Love.  At the Lexi Love.  At the Lexi Love.  Or T-H-E.

[03:42:00]  Tom, Tom, this is your favorite movie.  Sophie's Choice.  Look.  No, Sophie's Choice is very different.  No, look.  See?  It's Meryl Streep.  It's the daughter.  You're right.  Here it is.  Here's your movie.  You're right.  Look at that fine gentleman.  All right, listen to the movie.  No, he's a handsome man.  Tom, listen to the movie.  Here we go.  This is the scene that got you sad. 
[03:42:30]  Here it comes.  The Nazis talking to Meryl Streep as she's holding her daughter.  What's going on?  Tell us.  She's protecting her child.  Here we go.  Here we go.  They've got a still-hurt baby.  It's a tragic movie.  No, it's moving from my heart.  They stole her baby. 
[03:43:00]  It's not a kind of waiting camp in Germany.  No, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no. 
[03:43:30]  I would never do that.  That was your people, though.  Yeah.  You know.  Well, I was raised that way, but I'm not that way.  Tom, why are you so upset?  I don't get it.  Yeah, you got so upset watching that clip.  Why are you so upset?  There's tears in your eyes.  It was wrong. 
[03:44:00]  Why'd they take the little baby?  It was wrong.  What was wrong about that?  I'm sure he was taking the kids to get some good health care or something.  In those times, things were different, I guess.  You ain't gonna boo that shit now.  Why'd they take the baby, though?  The little baby got taken.  Oh, look.  She's...  Oh, no.  Look, here's the scene.  This is what bothers you? 
[03:44:30]  Yes!  It's Meryl Streep!  Stare, baby!  That's wrong!  No!  No!  Hey!  I would...  I would go fight!  Yeah?  Fight those Nazis?  That's a funny movie, right?  Did you laugh when you watched that movie?

[03:46:30]  Hey, with Ron Bennington today.  And who kid?  Jim Norton.  Very exciting show.  Oscar, who just saved the dating game.  Thank you, Oscar.  All right.  Pleasure.  And Bobo wants to go on the date with the gals.  Well, I want to take a picture of his photo.  Yeah, Bobo.  We're going to move on, but the people need to know that Bobo will not go away.  Yeah, he's sitting there in the studio.  He lost the dating game. 
[03:47:00]  Well, if I have to, whatever day it happens, I'll pay for it myself.  Why would you want to go on Oscar's date with him?  Well, I want to photograph it.  We got cameras.  We'll be photographing it.  You want to make sure Oscar doesn't stick his tongue down in Lexi Love's throat, right?  No, I want to make sure no one gets harmed.  Okay.  What are you saying, man?  I mean, Lexi is a friend of mine.  She's a friend of mine.  I mean, that's all she is.  He's a friend of mine, all right?  If I only know her as a friend of mine, I'm fine with that. 
[03:47:30]  Look at the look he's giving Oscar.  He's tight right now.  You're pissed off that Oscar won, aren't you, Bobo?  A little bit, but I'm not letting it get to me that I don't know.  Oh, you're not, aren't you?  So really, you just want to go on a date and be a fucking cock blocker with a camera?  I'm not going to be a conor.  Shut up.  Yes, you are.  I don't have to deal with anything that happens.  You shouldn't be there.  Your fucking mopey presence with a camera photographing it is going to wreck everything.  I think Lexi Love can handle herself. 
[03:48:00]  All right.  Well, then I won't be there that day.  Are you worried that Oscar's going to hurt her?  No.  I trust that no one will get hurt.  You just don't want Oscar touching your girl, Lexi Love, right?  No.  Be honest.  Be honest.  I just hope that everything's okay.  Above board.  Above board, right.  Do you have a...  Put it this way.  Hold on.  Do you have a problem with Oscar or any of the things he said?  Because you don't trust Oscar.  No.  It's just I felt I was a good person. 
[03:48:30]  I know he's been with so many girls.  He's been loyal.  What?  Yeah, you're right.  I'm a gentleman.  That's the difference, all right?  Yeah, I mean, I was a gentleman, too.  Why didn't she pick you?  Yeah.  What do you think?  I don't know.  Maybe she kind of felt...  Besides the fact that I wrote down, pick Oscar.  Unfortunately, maybe...  I guess maybe...  I guess I remember, make sure they haven't seen my junk before the first date.  Oh, wow.  Oh, yeah.  That's where you made him.  You think that's why she didn't pick you?  Yeah.  Yeah, you should have left the world to the imagination.  The operations, the 48 operations.  And I guess that I'm going to remember that for future reference when I ask those out. 
[03:49:00]  I make sure they haven't seen my junk before.  That's kind of a good thing.  Do not break out Frankencock.  Right.  Exactly.  Because...  Frankencock.  Unfortunately, there...  I'm not saying this about everybody, but there are some animals on Twitter that,  unfortunately, because of photos out there, they'll...  I mean, that's...  All right.  Thank you, Bobo.  I think I...  Oscar's going on the date without you. 
[03:49:30]  I'm sorry.  You all right with that, Oscar?  Yeah, you can stay home.  Hell yeah.  Frankencock.  Frankencock.  Oh, please, we kick the commies' asses.  Oh, shit.  And that country run by a James Bond villain of a president.  Wow, I haven't heard that one before.  That's brilliant.  I mean, take a look at...  That's fucking brilliant stuff right there.  All those shots they show of him in the stands, he looks like all those James Bond  movies where they show the bad guy sitting in the stands, and he's just, like, non-enthusiastically  clapping, like he has that evil look to his face. 
[03:50:00]  Like a...  Like a James Bond villain.  Yeah, yeah, of course.  But, of course.  Danny, what happened to you?  Well, you know, I also had another job.  You ran out of here.  You panicked on us.  I had another job here at SiriusXM.  I'm involved with the music channels.  That could have waited.  And we had a problem with one of the channels.  It went down, and we had to go on backup, and I had to make sure everything was  What could possibly have been the problem?  Like I just said, we had some technical difficulties between here and New York, and I needed to  take care of that.  The Four Seasons played before the Beatles, and it was supposed to be the Beatles, then 
[03:50:30]  the Four Seasons.  What could have been the problem?  I think Michael Bolton, who's in here live, started skipping.  Oh, all right.  Oh, was Michael Bolton skipping?  I think you ran out of here, because you don't work blue, and it was starting to get  blue.  No, no, no, because I could roll with it.  Oh.  I'm flexible.  I could roll with it.  What the fuck does that mean?  I don't know what you want to share, but are you allowed to go on a date with a porn  star?  Sure, why not?  Are you, uh...  I'm an available guy.  Are you available?  Ah, shit.  What's that?  Are you...  That's a culture. 
[03:51:00]  I don't know what you want to say.  No, I'm fine.  Are you separated?  What's that?  Are you separated?  Yes, you got it.  Oh, okay.  What happened?  You get fired three times in ten years.  You know, after a while, a woman just says, hey, you know...  Do you still use condoms at his age?  Do you use condoms?  What's that?  That's a good question.  Who kid wants to know if you use condoms still?  You see, there's certain things about myself that I don't reveal.  I like to keep it a secret.  So that means, no, Denny...  Denny likes to fucking raw dog and he won't pull out.  Denny's all in.  Denny puts the seed deep. 
[03:51:30]  I can't even see him putting it on.  I can't see him just, like, taking it out and then rolling it on his dick.  I can see him sticking it in her mouth and telling her girl to suck it on.  Again, you have to leave something to the imagination.  It's theater of the mind, my friend.  Yipes.  That's all part of the broadcast industry.  It makes good radio.  Leave babies behind like you're an NBA player.  Right.  One in every city.  It's amazing.  Right.  True, true.  Yeah.  We know for a fact.  Hell yeah, digger.  Long story. 
[03:52:00]  We know a guy that had one in every fucking city.  Get the fuck out of here.  We got his voicemail.  What?  Because some guy was pissed at him.  So they gave us the voicemail and his coat.  And we would play it on the radio.  I can't believe we used to do this.  And it was just one bitch after another in another city.  Just couldn't wait for him to come to town.  Was it Patrick Ewing?  I'm not going to say anymore.  I've said it many times in the air, so people, for the most part, yeah, we said the name  back in the day.  Damn.  He had a bitch in every city.  And they all thought they were the one. 
[03:52:30]  It was amazing to listen to.  Amazing.  You got to tell me off air.  It was John Havlicek.  With his freckled penis.  Girls went crazy for his freckled penis.  Very good.  Anyway.  So.  You got Denny out of the ways.  So he doesn't use condoms.  No.  Fucking no bag.  No bag, Denny.  He's too old to use a condom.  I respect that.  Thank you guys.  Always a pleasure being part of broadcasting history. 
[03:53:00]  Thanks, Denny.  You got to make sure the love channel is running properly.  Yeah, let's send this one straight out to the museum.  Yeah.  Please do.  What are you running next week?  Newlywed game?  What are you doing?  Next week.  Next week is the big.  The conclusion of the way off next Friday.  That's right, Ron.  We're doing it.  People want to know when you're on Raw Dog.  I think we're turning on some new people today for some.  Jenny in Wisconsin goes, when is Ron on Raw Dog? 
[03:53:30]  Noon to three.  Noon to three every day.  Despite the fact that you run all these promos, you still, people are like, what?  No one listens to the promos, you know?  And then Tim said that we do have a Twitter now.  It's Ron and Fez SXM.  Which you have nothing to do with.  You know, somebody does, I'm sure.  Yeah.  Somebody's tweeting things.  Ron and Fez what?  SXM.  SXM.  Okay.  That's our company.  Yeah, I know.  I guess you're right. 
[03:54:00]  It's never going to go back just to be an XM.  No.  And we wish it would.  At least you got Wiki with you.  Wiki Wiki.  Wiki, I brought him up earlier and you would, like, change the subject very drastically  on me.  What did you think?  I got the hint.  Oh.  I got the hint.  I'm a big fan of Don's.  I'm a fan of Don, too.  You know what?  Wasn't that a Valentine's that we all went out together?  We loved it.  That was the last time we had dinner and you hurt Don very much.  Well, I just made fun of the table he picked.  It was in the kitchen.  It was the chef's table in the kitchen. 
[03:54:30]  I guess that's a big deal for some people.  Yeah.  To me, it got extremely hot in there.  The food was excellent, though.  The food was fantastic.  What was the restaurant?  Well, it was the old London, which was Gordon Ramsay's place.  Right.  And he gets the chef's table where they come over and they make the food in front of you.  And explain everything.  And explain everything.  And this was Don taking his stuff.  And your clothes stink like a kitchen when you look at it?  Yeah.  I mean, you smell like scallions.  Like frying scallions.  But, oh, bitched through the whole thing and Don got really hurt. 
[03:55:00]  I enjoyed the hell out of it because it was very different.  I did enjoy it.  But you have to make fun of that situation, don't you?  Your table's in the middle of the kitchen.  It's so weird.  Yeah.  As they're running by you with plates of food for the people.  Oh, okay.  And they also said this.  If you want to help us prepare, go ahead.  And Don went up.  Not even making it up.  Don was over and chopping and frying.  Get the hell out of here.  I was very excited.  And me and Ron were just kind of, you know, chatting. 
[03:55:30]  I had a blast.  I had a good time.  I really did have a good time.  Was it exclusive?  Like, did they slice the potatoes or anything?  You can't just get that table?  Yeah.  No.  You've got to wait a year or something.  Get the fuck out of here.  And Don got it for some reason.  And he invited me and my lady and Ron and his lady.  Did Don have a lady then?  Yeah.  Quote, unquote, yes.  Was she there?  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  Now he had something called MasterCard Rewards Points.  That's why he got that table.  What?  He probably got that table because MasterCard Rewards Points. 
[03:56:00]  You know, Bobo, why are you going to shit all over everything?  You take something beautiful, then you shit on it.  Yeah.  Just because you're not getting to go out with Oscar.  This is why Lexi didn't want to spend the night with you.  I was just trying to.  I was just.  I thought it was a funny joke.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  That's great.  Then that's great.  Continue.  Please.  I thought it was a joke.  I was just saying that it seems like every MasterCard Rewards Point they see advertised.  Yeah, I know.  What do you mean by that, though? 
[03:56:30]  They always advertise, oh, MasterCard, Amex, get this exclusive.  Where do they do this at?  On what?  I don't know.  I guess.  I don't know what credit card companies do these because they're all this freaking same.  Screw you over.  Put you in debt.  Wait, what is?  Oh, these credit card companies are all the same.  But they say, oh, reward points.  Get the reward points.  It's exclusive seats.  Exclusive table in the kitchen.  You can use with your reward points.  Why are you mocking that?  I know.  Because that's exactly what happens.  Why are you mocking something that can happen that sounds really cool? 
[03:57:00]  I don't understand that credit stuff.  What's your angle on this?  What does that mean?  There's always hidden BS.  The fine print that they purposely make too small.  Why do they do that?  They tell you to put 1,000, then you have 1,000 credit.  What the fuck does that mean?  It's a debit.  Yeah, I don't know.  Some Russell Simmons shit.  Yeah.  And then they purposely make it hard to understand.  You don't really get those reward points. 
[03:57:30]  Well, Bobo, it's always something with you.  He's ready to cock block.  How many reward points do you have?  I'm not currently dealing with credit cards right now.  Why?  Why don't you tell Lexi that?  Maybe that would have impressed her.  You've got to count out the singles to pay for dinner.  If you're getting one.  Huh?  I'm in the process of signing up for a Citibank card.  Oh, shit.  ATM, son. 
[03:58:00]  Ass to mouth.  Oh, man.  I'm thinking of porn.  You got an ATM card?  Yeah, I'm with the story of Federal.  What the fuck?  Why do you say it that way?  Is that a bad thing?  To be with the story of Federal?  I don't know.  Reliable thing, but where's the cool reward points?  Where's the cool reward stuff?  Like I see you think with City.  Where's the cool VIP experience at the Met game? 
[03:58:30]  Or VIP sideline passes at the Giants game?  I'm angry, man.  You'll be lucky to get a clock radio with your reward points.  You're lucky if they give you a toaster.  Okay.  Oh, well.  We'll take a clock radio.  We'll just switch it.  I appreciate you hammering my joke.  Here at the story of Federal.  He's embarrassed to say it.  The story of Federal, we just got a roof.  Right.  I think they're all right, I think. 
[03:59:00]  And we don't open exactly at 8 o'clock,  because if the guy's watch is one hour behind,  he won't open the door until it's 8.30 on his watch.  The math didn't work out there.  What the fuck?  Who walks around with their watch off by an hour?  I'm a bit stretching the truth like that,  but if you're familiar with the area of Woodside, Queens,  you know what I'm talking about at that story of Federal, 
[03:59:30]  how that security guard is.  It has to be exactly that time on his watch.  Even though the cell phones have very accurate clocks,  it has to be 8.30 on his watch.  So what?  Sometimes you've had to wait until 8.31, 8.32 before they open the doors?  Sometimes I think five minutes.  I think I remember once ten minutes, maybe.  Did you write it down at home when that happened?  I'm just...  No, I don't keep track of it,  but I've seen it enough times to notice it.  I picked up on it. 
[04:00:00]  Okay.  Thank you, Bobo.  My mom's been with that bank for years.  All right, all right.  Thank you, Bobo.  Thank you.  I hope everybody enjoyed today's show.  Oh, there's more.  Every time that you have Bobo in,  I'm like,  well, this makes me miss public transportation.  Oscar, are you all right over there?  You're quiet.  Oh, hell yeah.  No, I just...  Planning the date?  You got a date today.  That's cool. 
[04:00:30]  Oh, hell yeah.  She's cool, Lexi Love, too.  Yeah, she's really cute, man.  I really like her.  You think you could get any off her, or...  You know, I'm not going to force it,  because, you know, when you force it,  it's just that, just...  But what's your move?  What's my move?  Yeah, what's going to be your move with her?  Oh, well, yeah, just...  Walk us through it.  Like, what are you going to do?  Get a drunk?  Slipper?  Something?  Well, I could.  I could, but no, I'm just...  You could.  But I'm just going to just talk nice, chill,  you know, a one-to-one, you know, anything.  You know she's a porn star, right?  Oh, wow, I had no idea.  Oh, shit, this motherfucker.  That's right. 
[04:01:00]  I think it's better.  Maybe because that's...  So the odds might be a little better,  is what I'm saying.  So you better be on your game.  Yeah, I don't have to do anything crazy.  It's just, you know...  No, porn stars don't always fuck, though,  because they want something different on a real date.  Exactly, so that's why I'm there to provide, you know?  So what a lot of them will do  is they'll go out and they'll do a scene,  and then their whole thing is  whoever they go out with  has to clean their pussy.  Damn, whoa.  Jesus.  Are you ready to clean that fucking pussy nigga?  I'll do it, man.  I'm open to anything. 
[04:01:30]  Clean it as shit.  Suck the cream out of the donut, cuck boy.  Yeah, yeah, a little vinegar, seltzer water.  A little vinegar.  That's how you would clean it out?  I don't know, man.  Jesus.  Vinegar will get rid of anything, man.  You know that.  Yeah, yeah, well,  I clean my plasma TVs with vinegar, so...  So it's got to work on a pussy.  No, it's not bad.  I just used a little rag and just...  Where'd you learn that little trick?  Oh, it's...  Doesn't your apartment smell like shit? 
[04:02:00]  Yeah, vinegar stinks.  Smells like a douche in the apartment.  Yeah, actually, yeah, vinegar smells like...  I don't like that vinegar, man.  So why are you using it to...  I mean, it gets just rid of...  I mean, I get rid of the salt in my boots.  But not on your shoulder.  Oh, Ferris, he didn't realize someone was going to bite his shoulder today, though.  I'll be ready, man.  I'll be ready.  I'm just...  You could do that.  You could put vinegar in your fucking boot to get rid of the salt.  Yeah, trust me.  Yeah.  Where'd that come from?  I don't know.  No, I mean, I worked in...  It's an Irish thing, obviously. 
[04:02:30]  They're all in about that.  You could do that.  Mm-hmm.  Hell yeah.  White people are crazy.  No, no, what?  This is the thing.  This is...  I mean, I worked in a little shoe repair shop.  Oh, okay.  So...  But of course.  Yeah, I learned a few tricks.  I mean, I used to be a shoemaker, you know, to fix stuff.  You know, people...  You can fix a shoe.  Yeah, shoes, leather, anything.  I mean, I'll fix it.  Hell yeah.  You know how to get stains out.  Oh, yes.  Yeah?  Absolutely, man.  Hell yeah.  What do they use?  Oh, yeah.  All sorts of different material, like fantastic, you know, vinegar. 
[04:03:00]  How much do you get paid in a shoe shop?  Like, people get paid to work there.  I thought it was a hobby.  Right.  No, you get paid.  No, I mean, there's not...  I mean, nowadays...  How much do you get paid?  Yeah, what do you get, one customer a day?  It seems like a business that they don't need anymore.  Exactly.  Well, I mean, you know, all those shoes are just made overseas, so nowadays people just  get by a pair and just throw them out.  Right.  That's what you do.  There's people, lawyers that still have high-end shoes.  I wonder how much you get fucking paid.  Oh, you want to know?  Yeah.  I was making like 15 an hour.  15 an hour? 
[04:03:30]  Yeah.  To get stains out of shoes.  Get the fuck out of here.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  Yeah, nice to get a lot of tips, too.  I call my loser brother.  Yeah, tips are good.  Give my nigga a job.  You know what I'm saying?  I hear ya.  Hell ya.  15 fucking dollars.  That's crazy.  15 dollars?  Shit.  All right.  What the fuck, man?  What the fuck, man?  Drop it out on a high note.  Drop it out on a high note.  We got 20 minutes left.  Oh, I forgot.  Yeah.  It's a new time.  The 1030.  Yeah.  Sometimes we leave in early. 
[04:04:00]  It's fun, though.  Like when you sneak out.  Sure.  If we all just snuck out of here.  Yeah.  It's a long weekend.  It is a long weekend.  But do they regulate you guys?  You can't sneak out of here, right?  Well, we couldn't, I guess.  Sure.  We're all going to the Bregada for Jim Norton shows.  Oh, shit.  What was that today?  It's the Bregada weekend.  Tonight and tomorrow.  I have one show available, the late show on tomorrow.  Everything else sold out.  Wow.  Not bad.  This guy's the man right here.  I'll be in the audience at the Patrice benefit with my friend Lindsay. 
[04:04:30]  Oh, nice.  That's useful info.  Yeah, I consider her like a younger sister to me.  Sure.  She's a good friend.  You probably met her.  I don't know.  I think she was here.  I know Anthony knows Lindsay.  She's a nice girl.  She's a good friend of mine.  And I hope, if I ever, the day I finally do end up a girlfriend, I hope I get a nice  girlfriend as nice as she is.  I have to say, ever since I've been friends with her, I've been team wins ever since I've 
[04:05:00]  been friends with her.  And I also have to say, I'm still writing some stuff for the Bobo and Colin Quinn road trip.  I even came up with some stuff.  See if we could find Lady Di in a cornfield.  Don't go in the way that we're not letting her drink it until we get the bite of it.  I don't know.  I'm lost.  What the fuck happened? 
[04:05:30]  Bobo, you've got to do a podcast.  You've got to save this good material for your podcast.  The thing is, Bobo, if you think it, it doesn't mean you have to say it.  Right.  That's the one filter that you need.  Think some things without explaining it to people.  Right.  You've got to quickly in your head go, man, will this be interesting to anyone?  And if the answer is no, maybe you should not say it.  No, when the answer is no.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, I get what you're saying.  You know what I mean? 
[04:06:00]  As a matter of fact, the podcast was part of one of the bits on the road trip.  What the fuck?  Do you remember what Ron just said nearly a minute ago?  I do remember, but that...  Do you think this might be interesting for people?  The podcast on the road show that's never happening?  Well, it is going to happen.  Me and Colin are aiming for June.  June?  June!  See, this is what Colin's doing today.  There's no Joom. 
[04:06:30]  He's fucking with you.  No, no, I said June.  The month of June.  Oh, it came out Joom.  It just came out the way it sounded.  Right.  Joom.  Now, Sam is sitting next to you.  I'm sure he thinks some nutty things.  But he keeps it to himself, Bo.  He doesn't share.  Well, when I've been talking to Colin,  he kept saying to keep up plugging the idea.  Yes. 
[04:07:00]  Colin fucking with us.  Colin's been a very supportive friend of mine.  Yeah, well, if you really care,  the key to that is Seinfeld,  and we told you to tweet him,  and you won't.  I tweeted him months ago,  and I heard he was bothering him.  He was tweeting him once every day.  Who said it was bothering him?  Oh, Colin said that, supposedly.  Because he's probably jealous  because Seinfeld was probably  reading your tweets, dummy.  And he was probably jealous.  Yeah, you were getting somewhere.  Well, Seinfeld does not follow me.  It doesn't matter.  He doesn't follow anybody 
[04:07:30]  because if he starts following people,  then everybody knows.  He's a private guy.  He doesn't follow everybody he checks out.  It's not the way it works.  All right, well, then I'm going to go back  to tweeting him once every day.  But let him know that Colin wants you to.  Because if you do that,  but keep it nice.  Don't be nasty.  I mean, don't be a dick to him.  All right, that's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to come up with a nice way  to say that I'm going to be doing this  at least once every day.  Yeah, road trip.  And the way of saying it,  because we may...  I don't care how you do it. 
[04:08:00]  Just do it.  Don't surprise me.  You have to tell me now.  You want to say it in a nice way that...  It doesn't matter.  You're boring everyone.  ...to tweet him at least once every day.  Just think these things through.  Yeah, like Ron said,  you don't have to say it.  We're not a part of your mental process.  His ears are like flaring.  Right?  Yeah, they are.  You mad?  You still mad?  No, it's just because there's nothing  in between them.  I'm over it.  Okay.  But that hurt me when Lexi didn't pick you,  too.  I was like, what is she doing?  You thought you were shooing.  You thought you were shooing.  Yeah, it was obvious.  I did, too.  I'm not mad at Lexi Love. 
[04:08:30]  Did you think she was going to pick you all along?  You probably felt this is easy, right?  I felt she was going to pick me  because we share that really great Twitter friendship.  I knew she wasn't going to pick you  because on this side of the screen  I saw the faces she was making.  And that's what fucking pissed me off.  Like when you were talking  she was like making faces  and doing like the jerk off thing.  Wow.  Crazy.  Like she was going to like crazy.  I'm like, what is with her?  Because I thought you had this thing, Bo.  I thought this was your day. 
[04:09:00]  Well, I'm okay with knowing her  as that friendship we share on Twitter.  Uh-huh.  Because she's still a good person  and I value the importance of her friendships.  People share friendships on Twitter?  It's nice.  I don't think she likes his voice.  That's probably what it is.  He's got a good voice.  You got a good voice?  Yeah.  You know what?  If Oscar wasn't here, you would have won.  I got to make do with the voice I was given.  This is what I was given.  Oh, yeah.  It's the voice I was given.  Fuck you.  Oscar, you want to give your date away? 
[04:09:30]  Hell no.  Get the fuck out of here, man.  I won very square, man.  Yeah, exactly.  Like Oscar said,  he won and he doesn't have to give the date away.  He won it and he should go on that date.  I agree with Oscar.  Keep your mouth shut, man.  Keep your mouth shut.  Keep your mouth shut.  Wow.  Wow.  That's what real shit up here.  Hey, I was just being nice.  Oscar, don't play.  You can see it.  He's becoming really annoying, man.  He's just being the same tree.  Are you saying, Oscar, that he's making it about himself, right?  Wait, what's up?  Sorry?  He's making it about himself right now. 
[04:10:00]  Yeah, I know.  It's about myself.  This is not about myself.  You're the one who won.  Yeah, you'd be an attention whore, man.  All right?  What do you have to say about that, Bobo?  I wasn't making this about myself.  I wasn't trying to draw touch with myself.  I was trying to make sure to acknowledge that.  Yeah, but you keep talking.  That's the thing.  That's what you're doing.  You keep talking.  It's part of the show.  I'm supposed to talk.  What?  Oh, wow.  All right.  I'm not going to be quiet and do a Phez impersonation. 
[04:10:30]  Oh, wow.  Now you're taking shots.  Now you're taking shots.  Now you're taking shots.  What the fuck just happened?  Phez isn't even here to defend himself.  I don't know.  That's fucked up.  And that hurt him somewhere.  Believe me, I lowered him.  You just ruined Front's day.  You fucked up.  I enjoy Phez and all the laughs he brings.  But sometimes when he gets silent, it gets a little bit...  It kind of bums me out when he's silent a lot.  I get bummed out when he's silent. 
[04:11:00]  Do you like it or do you get bummed out?  I get bummed out when he's silent for the whole time.  All right.  It kind of gets out like...  It feels like something's missing when Phez is silent.  You know what?  When people don't talk, it's a moment to learn and understand other people.  Maybe you should learn that.  Oscar can't take it anymore.  I'm sorry if I've gotten you, Sabine, a very energetic Phez Watley. 
[04:11:30]  Wow, that's something to strive for.  That's something to strive for, an energetic Phez Watley.  I remember Phez being very energetic.  Right.  Okay, but we're not talking about Phez.  Phez is good.  Phez is all right.  He's a good guy.  I got mad respect for Phez.  Oh, after you trashed him for five minutes.  That's great.  That's wonderful.  Oh, Phez has made me laugh.  He's made me laugh. 
[04:12:00]  Jesus Christ.  What, Oscar?  Oh, man.  Sorry.  Yeah, no, I mean, I just...  I'll be honest with you, man.  I mean, I'm a very understanding person, because sometimes it would just...  People always have to be a little patient, man, and just...  They don't talk so much, man.  Because, like, when you talk, it's just...  It's a problem.  I mean, I have to have a problem with it, man.  Oscar, light him up, if it happens again.  Yeah, absolutely.  Just don't fucking throw in hints. 
[04:12:30]  Oh, hell yeah.  David in Israel.  What's up, David?  Good morning, Opie.  How are you?  Good, brother.  He's a regular.  He's got the high voices, David.  There's actually a big market for credit card points.  I mean, it's in our community.  If you have 100,000 AmEx points, you can make an easy $1,500.  So, for not to be discounted, there's a big market for selling them and making money.  This would have been relevant like 10 minutes ago, man.  Oscar.  Can't take it.  Yeah, I just...  Oscar's had it. 
[04:13:00]  I'm going to take a hint of punch out.  No, no.  Didn't you want to say something to WhoKid, too?  Nothing.  WhoKid's probably a high roller, big spender.  He has a million points.  But the Jew figured out, you know, a workaround.  That's nice.  There's a real shit right there.  It says that you want WhoKid to go to Israel to do his thing.  Have you ever gone to Israel?  I've been out there.  How is it?  How's the partying out there?  The girls are crazy.  I think they're all in the army.  Really?  Until they're like 19 or 18 or something like that.  But they suck dick, too.  Oh, shit. 
[04:13:30]  Did I say that on air?  Yeah, you're kind of dead.  Fuck.  Everybody sucks dick.  What?  Sam.  Right.  Right?  Yeah.  Sam, how did you feel like your gig went today?  I was loving it.  Because I saw you, like, after we went to break, going like this.  Nailed it.  Well, I thought Oscar, I mean, you don't know how the park.  Yeah.  Thank God.  You know, Oscar killed it on his return.  And, I mean, there's always a show where there's a character who maybe it's time to put him on the bench for a while. 
[04:14:00]  And, you know, there's always that one show where you realize, yeah.  Yes, that show occurred in 2009.  Bobo, Sam wants to put you on the bench for a while.  Well, I'm not taking, I hope I don't take that long time where it goes, that it goes that too long of a time.  I get start, I start getting, hitting the bottle when it gets two months. 
[04:14:30]  When it gets over two months.  What do you mean you're hitting the bottle?  Well, once it's gone past the third month, it gets to be, it feels like that.  Why does everyone have to fucking depend on us?  Don't do your own thing.  I don't feel like a bottle.  Why are you depending on us?  And if we don't do right by you, you hit the bottle.  It gets worse because my XM P3i got stolen.  I'm never letting my sister borrow that.  And again, if I ever get a new one off of eBay. 
[04:15:00]  Oh, shit.  I can't listen.  I didn't want to apologize to Ron Bennington.  I haven't listened to the show.  Yeah.  I haven't been able to listen to the show.  Okay, all right.  Because I made the mistake of letting my sister borrow it.  Let me say hi to Mikey in California.  Mikey!  I want to listen to the show.  Oscar, you need to calm the fuck down.  Wait, what?  Because you want a contest.  Because you want a contest, it doesn't mean you got to give a fucking talking shit to  everyone else.  Oh, I'm not talking shit to you, man.  So what the fuck are you getting in this conversation?  Hey.  What?  You know, calm the fuck down. 
[04:15:30]  Calm the fuck down?  Dude, I'm fucking sitting right here, man, and keeping my patience over here, right?  Yo, why don't you just go back to California and just fucking bury yourself?  in a hole, man.  Let's go.  Here.  There's a million appointments right here.  Wait, shouldn't you be working or something, man?  Oh, maybe you're unemployed, huh?  Calm down.  Wait, so what?  You're like a therapist or something?  I just woke up, right?  No.  You just wake up.  Yeah, because you sound like you're in bed, man. 
[04:16:00]  See, I've been up since five already, man, all right?  I really fucking clean my driveway and my walkway, all right?  Jesus, how have you?  You hear the sexy voice?  Oh, wait, what do you do, man?  What do you do?  Calm down.  Calm the fuck down.  Calm the fuck down.  Yeah?  Yeah, what?  You don't like it?  You don't like it when I talk, huh?  No, you sound like a moron.  Oh, yeah?  Well, you sound like a retard, all right?  Oh, fuck.  A moron.  Retard.  Not as good as retard.  They don't know that. 
[04:16:30]  Fuck.  You make Bobo sound quite normal.  Oh, really?  Oh, is that so, huh?  Good one.  I didn't have nothing.  I didn't have nothing.  Anyways, what's up, man?  What are you up to, man?  Come on.  I'm telling you to calm the fuck down.  Yeah, well, I'm calm.  I'm calm.  So, what's up?  What else, man?  You want to tell me anything else?  Yes, your voice is annoying.  Oh, really?  Oh, is that?  It's all high-pitched and, you know, a little too, like, urgh. 
[04:17:00]  Oh, are you a vocal coach or something?  Are you a vocal coach?  All right.  He just wants you to calm down.  All right.  I'll calm down.  I'll calm down.  Just calm down.  Oh, yeah.  Thank you, Opie.  Just calm down.  You won the date.  Simmer down.  You're good.  Simmer down.  You're all right.  Well, we could start wrapping up now.  I want to thank Oscar. 
[04:17:30]  What's the big plug for the band, Oscar?  Oh, yeah.  Well, yeah.  We're just going to come out with the new album, May.  Theonlyweapon.com.  Check it out.  We have free music up there.  Downloadable material, videos.  Yeah, check it out, man.  Me and my friend Joe.  Joe used to intern here with us.  Okay.  He was the one at Colby one day.  And I said, hey, come and audition, man.  I auditioned.  Me and Vinny, we got together.  We really just made a good team.  And then we've been playing guitar for two years.  Yeah, we played at the Trash Bar in Brooklyn a couple weeks ago.  It was a great show, man.  It was like over 100 people.  Showed up.  Had a good time, man. 
[04:18:00]  Very cool.  Hell yeah, man.  Good.  You guys are doing it.  Nice.  Absolutely.  All right.  Bobo.  For one thing, I can't bear having to hear my mother's voice all day without being able  to hear four hours of O&A and Jimmy's voices every day.  Well, you're obviously not a fan if you don't listen to the show, so it moves on.  So what's your plug?  Radio from eBay?  I don't have to say I'm plugging it.  And I also like to thank everybody who followed me on Twitter that asked for an acknowledgement. 
[04:18:30]  I kid too many of you to name, but you know who you are.  Thanks.  Too many to name.  He has 58,000 fake followers right now.  No, there's a lot of fake followers, but there's also a lot of real followers.  The only problem is whoever.  I don't know how that was a glitch, but I'm not going to acknowledge the fake followers.  I only acknowledge the real ones, and you guys know who you are. 
[04:19:00]  I thank you guys.  The real followers.  It's beautiful.  It's nice.  Thank you.  Yeah.  We still got 12 minutes to go.  No, we don't.  Okay, where are you going to be, brother?  San Francisco, Saturday, but I will be with Kevin Hart for Valentine's Day.  Why?  On my show.  You guys taped that already?  Yeah, it's a moisture Valentine pussy.  I saw the Instagram pictures already.  They look terrific, so.  Well, it got me in people.com, so I guess, you know, this motherfucker's famous. 
[04:19:30]  Yeah.  He came in too late for us that day.  He came in at like 10.30.  Really?  Yeah, he did come late.  Because he was coming from TV.  That's why we didn't talk to him.  Kevin Hart is really fucking famous.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Well, this has been his year, too, man.  Hell yeah.  Every time you turn around, it's another movie with him.  He's done this weekend, right?  How many movies this year alone?  Today, actually.  Yeah.  It's three straight movies from it.  About last night.  Yeah.  Ice Cube thing is done already.  Fuck it.  90 million.  And he's moved on from that already.  Did he make 90?  90 million. 
[04:20:00]  That's good.  That's a hit.  Oh, boy.  It costs like a million to make or something.  For a comedy?  That's huge.  That's a major fucking hit.  Yeah.  Nice.  Good for Kevin Hart.  I'm sure we'll see him soon.  I'm happy, too, because I would hate it if he put me in his movies.  And they changed those grudge match trailers.  After the movie came out, they took De Niro and Stallone out of the trailers and just made  them complete Kevin Hart trailers, trying to get...  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Just trying to get his fans to watch that piece of shit.  That's exactly right.  That was a bad movie, man.  They're basically saying that Kevin Hart has bypassed Stallone and Robert De Niro. 
[04:20:30]  Right now.  They figure they get the black audience in.  It's amazing.  Wow.  What are you saying?  De Niro doesn't draw the black audience anymore?  Probably not as well, no.  I'm guessing Stallone doesn't either.  I mean, at one point, I'm sure, but now they probably don't feel as well.  Stallone got all that surgery, right?  Looks like a fucking girl or something.  Yeah.  That's what happens with guys when they get the plastic surgery.  They start looking like women.  Yeah, I'd rather see a movie with the Rocky statue from fucking Philly.  Did you ever stop by and see that? 
[04:21:00]  Get your picture taken with the fucking Rocky statue.  No, I know.  Standing next to it.  I did run up to Sturve, so you got to do that one.  Yeah, you got to run up to Sturve.  One time you got to do that, like a goofball.  But why the legends can't just let themselves get old naturally?  Why the surgery?  Why all the hair pieces and tans?  The thing is, if it worked, you'd do it.  You know what I mean?  But it doesn't fucking work.  It looks stupid.  Al Pacino, you look like a fucking tomato.  And that Bruce Jenner is the fucking scariest.  Where is he at today?  Is he getting ready to admit that he might be turning into a woman? 
[04:21:30]  Well, they just posted a video of him doing like a speech, like a, what's it called, talk?  He pulled his hair back into a ponytail because he doesn't want everyone to see the lady do.  Yeah, in a man's suit.  Right.  So he's wearing like a suit and he pulled his hair back to give everybody a motivational speech.  Because it's getting to him a little bit.  He quit the Kardashians.  Yes.  Did he?  He's not going to do that TV show yet.  They're going for another fucking, Jesus, I don't get it.  Another multi-million dollar deal for the Kardashians was just announced yesterday, I think, and also announced Bruce is out. 
[04:22:00]  People watch it, though.  It's fucking ridiculous.  It's the only thing that's on E!, right?  Yeah, it's a lot.  It's all kinds of shows and now it's just them, constantly.  I understand people watching, but to that extent, I don't care.  I have no idea.  I just don't fucking get it.  I've never seen an episode of it.  I literally, I have not contributed one iota to that fucking shitty family business.  They got a ridiculous fucking new deal to continue the show.  I don't understand why Bruce Jenner is transforming himself into something. 
[04:22:30]  He appears to be a woman.  He doesn't even look cute.  No.  He's not turning into a woman.  That's what it looks like.  When you're shaving your Adam's apple, can you imagine anything scarier than that?  I mean, like, if you had some cancer, obviously you would do it, but you'd be freaked out.  Yeah.  But to do that to your healthy fucking Adam's apple.  That's crazy.  Like, go in, cut it, make it a little smaller.  Damn.  For what reason?  I don't know.  Why does he just wear an old fucking Olympic medal?  Right. 
[04:23:00]  Like, anybody remember 76?  I fucking dominated.  That is the weirdest sport, though, because he told me this one time, that the day that  he won and he's the greatest athlete in the world, he had to quit to start making money  because you couldn't do both then.  Oh, shit.  So it would be like you're watching the fucking Super Bowl, Aaron Rodgers throws for fucking  and goes, now I've got to quit.  Right.  Goodbye.  I never played football again.  It's so stupid they can't make money.  It's the dumbest thing ever.  Especially because there's no professional version of that sport, really. 
[04:23:30]  Yeah.  Why can't the fucking Olympic, the networks are making money?  Everybody's making money.  Why can't the athletes?  They're making billions.  They make billions off the athletes.  They don't give any money to college kids.  And that fucking college football is the second biggest league in America.  It's bigger than baseball.  And they don't pay those kids.  And then March Madness, they pay billions of dollars and they don't pay those kids.  And they're the stars.  They are the fucking stars.  There's a million stories where these kids can't even go home for holidays or something  because they would receive the plane ticket illegally. 
[04:24:00]  One of them takes a fucking t-shirt from somebody and loses their fucking scholarship.  They don't even eat properly.  They don't even have enough money to eat half the time.  But I did hear they're trying to get them to eat.  They should.  Fuck the colleges.  They should pay them.  The colleges don't want to give them a taste.  They could change that tomorrow if they wanted to.  Easy.  It's their fucking league.  $150,000 a year.  It's not the government or anything.  They've decided, fuck that.  That means there's less money for us.  Yeah, that's crazy.  That's why you're right.  The government has nothing to do with it.  So they could change it tomorrow. 
[04:24:30]  It's their own association.  Their greed.  It's their own greed, right, of course.  But like Bruce Jenner, the decathlon, he should have been able to compete in more Olympics  and get paid.  Absolutely.  Of course.  I think he can now.  But that's stupid.  You could do shoe deals and shit.  Those days you couldn't.  There's no luge league.  So let the luge guys make a few bucks if they have to.  It's too bad there's not a luge league.  Because I'd be watching.  Wow.  So you're going to tell me eventually Bruce Jenner's going to wear high heels? 
[04:25:00]  He's got the long nails.  He's got the long nails.  He's got the shaved Adam's apple.  Come on, man.  And they're saying his hairdo is a hairdo that the ladies really like wearing right now.  It's very feminine.  Why are they gay people not angry about this?  Look at his hair.  He's embarrassing.  You haven't seen these yet?  He looks like plastic.  Look at the fucking hair he's sporting.  And they say it's a female do.  Maybe I'm crazy.  The number one female do.  There you go.  Look at that.  Would you wear your hair like that? 
[04:25:30]  I think he looks great.  Seriously.  Well, he's gone through a weird thing, I guess.  He's no longer a Kardashian.  Yeah.  So when he finally tries to...  He wants to be something less embarrassing.  Fucking a half-man woman with no Adam's apple and a fucking bicycle helmet hairdo.  What is the last thing they do?  Fucking the dick operation?  Oh, man.  Yeah, they transition.  They start taking hormones.  I mean, how much detail do you want?  Jesus.  Look at Chastity Bono. 
[04:26:00]  That's a legit dude now, man.  Have you seen it?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Now she, he, whatever, walks around with no shirt on like any other guy.  He's hot.  Kind of look like a dude, too.  But where does he bite a dick from?  I think he's going...  I think he was trying to raise money for the dick.  Yeah, I don't think Chastity ever got a dick.  Oh, really?  I heard they got on my camera.  I heard...  She...  I always have to say she, hey,  because it's so confusing me.  It really is.  Look at that.  You would say that's a dude.  Yeah, you look like a fucking white dude. 
[04:26:30]  Now, don't they attempt with that to make the clit bigger?  Yeah, they straight...  They make it from the...  Because with the...  With the cock, they don't cut it off.  Right.  They fucking split it.  Fucking pull it back and...  No, don't let this get to you.  They split it.  Like a hot dog.  They pull it back and then they push it in.  Right.  Oh.  And then they take the one part and just fucking say, this is your clit.  Are you unconscious for that?  No.  Let me give you a local...  They give you an Aleve, I think, yeah. 
[04:27:00]  Where do you buy dicks for that, though?  Where do you...  You gotta go...  I wanna buy a dick today.  You gotta go to South America or something.  You probably gotta play a dick.  That's why they call it reassignment surgery.  What the...  They're reassigning your dick.  What the fuck?  Right.  So can I donate my dick if I die?  Donate your dick to science?  For people that wanna get dicks.  That'd be nice.  How many diseases are there, I guess?  That's not my problem.  You might have to...  The good news is you're a man.  The bad news...  The good news is you got a huge black dick. 
[04:27:30]  I can't tell you what this dick has been.  Bad news.  Shelf life on this thing is 18 months.  Fucking no kid.  It would be great, though, if you checked the checkbox on the organ donor.  You were right with Ogun.  Ogun.  My dick under it.  Well, Ronnie, it was a pleasure, sir.  It's always a pleasure.  Sorry for the bump in the road in the middle there.  That's okay.  You know, sometimes I come in here and, you know, it's Louie and Ricky Gervais.  And other times it's Bobo. 
[04:28:00]  You're gonna get...  And Oscar, though.  Oscar was the killer.  Oscar killed.  Oscar did.  And I was pulling for him the whole time.  Yeah.  So was I, obviously, as I wrote that down.  The contest was fixed, Bobo.  What?  Now I know that.  I also gotta say, Anthony, you dearly missed the one who follows me.  You dearly missed you, Anthony.  I'm talking to him. 
[04:28:30]  All right, Ron Bennington.  Oh.  The ultimate bit for you is to have Fez do this.  That's the ultimate.  There has been some talk.  Fez, you know, talking...  I think he would do it for the show.  No, we talked cross-dressing with him, but he just wants to wear ladies' pants suits.  That's hilarious.  He doesn't want to be sexy.  He wants to be sensible.  He does.  And he said he wants to dress like Barbara Walter.  Oh, my God.  That would be great.  I'm like, that's not where I'm gonna go.  That'd be great.  Oh, God.  You gotta do that. 
[04:29:00]  All right, Ron Bennington is on Raw Dog with Ron and Fez, noon to three, every day on Raw Dog.  Check him out.  And, of course, the iBang on Twitter.  And the social media on Twitter.  The Ron and Fez SXM.  He's now up and running.  They force us now.  They believe in the social media thing.  All right, cigarettes.  You have met your match.

[04:37:00]  Unfortunately, the O.P. and Anthony show is over.  Fortunately, we have a hard time letting go.  The stories behind the stories.  Behind the stories.  The backstage drama.  Everything that made today unforgivable.  Call 866-WOW-1-WOW now.  And look back on another legendary day of broadcasting.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Post Show. 
[04:37:30]  With Sam Roberts.  It's still going.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  This is shit right here.  866-969-1969.  Who Kid's still hanging out.  Oscar's still here.  Bobo's still here.  And I gotta tell you.  If you're following Who Kid on Instagram.  At Just Who Kid Oscar.  Have you seen Who Kid's Instagram?  Oh, no.  Not yet.  Oh, you like fat asses and girls who shake it?  Oh, hell yeah.  I appreciate that.  Yeah.  Alright.  You gotta go to Just Who Kid on Instagram.  Because he's in the club every night. 
[04:38:00]  Nice.  And he's just taking pictures of chicks making out.  Shaking their asses.  You like that?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Fuck a couple of them in the car.  Nice.  You fucked somebody in the car before you came here today?  Yeah, because I'm so fucking exhausted.  Yeah, I mean, I was watching you.  And it was like, just now.  And Who Kid's been up all night.  He was in the club all night.  With Wiz Khalifa.  With Wiz Khalifa, which means...  Smoking weed.  They were getting very high.  Uh-huh.  A lot of medicinal marijuana.  Drinking lean.  Yeah.  Is that that syrup? 
[04:38:30]  It was NyQuil and juice or something.  NyQuil and juice?  You sampled lean before?  I took a couple sips.  What does it do to you?  It got me fucked up.  Because some rappers get completely addicted to it.  Yeah, they get like...  I'm not...  I'm not me, though.  As we call it on the Opie and Anthony show,  a scissor.  Vanessa Hutchins said that Gucci Mane  literally fell asleep on the set of the movie...  Come on in, Nicole.  Fell asleep on the set of the movie...  Oh, shit. 
[04:39:00]  What was that movie that he was in?  Spring Breakers.  Oh, did he?  Because he was smoking weed and drinking lean the entire time.  Let's start going to some calls.  866-WOW1-WOW.  And what I was getting at was  Who Kid was sitting here  after the whole night of being in the club  and smoking weed and drinking lean  and hanging out with Wiz Khalifa.  Then he fucked some bitch in the car.  Did you get her name or no?  You know what?  I don't even know...  Her name was some bitch.  Some bitch, yeah.  I don't even know her name.  But she's from Australia, though.  That was it.  You just picked it up on the accent.  From Perth.  He comes in.  He sits in on another wild, crazy Opie and Anthony show. 
[04:39:30]  Classic.  I never laughed so hard.  But I've never seen anyone so exhausted  because for the entire commercial break just now,  Bobo is talking his ear off.  Yo, like non-fucking stuff.  Do you have any idea what he was saying?  No, I had to not say it because it was personal.  Yeah, it was personal.  It was some deep stuff that I had to deal with.  You got deep with who, kid?  That's deep in my body.  People got to say...  I got to say some stuff.  People just know me.  They hear me on the radio.  They think I'm just the idiot on the radio. 
[04:40:00]  Right?  True.  But there's actually a lot...  There's a really different person off the air.  A lot of layers to Bobo, right?  Yeah, there's layers.  On the air...  I love being on this show  and I love just joking around  and having a good time.  And how your penis...  It's just you and the guys.  Just kind of...  We're all hanging out.  Yeah, it's just me joking around  and sometimes there are things I go...  You know, I never talked to Bobo.  This is the first time we had  like this intimate connection.  When I'm here and this...  Even when I was able to listen to the show 
[04:40:30]  before whoever...  Before I made that mistake  of letting my sister borrow my XMP3R...  I don't want to hear about your stolen radio anymore, Bobo.  We get it.  Your radio got stolen.  You did touch my leg, though.  Bobo touched your leg?  Bobo.  He was trying to make a point.  It was by accident.  It was by accident.  Oh, it was by accident.  It was by accident.  The very pregnant Nicole Biggins  from the morning mashup.  Oscar, you believe how pregnant...  You remember this chick  when you were an intern?  Absolutely.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Look out.  She's super pregnant.  She's sexy.  Oscar today on the show. 
[04:41:00]  Oscar, do you remember Oscar?  He's our former intern.  I do.  I do remember this face.  He made a big impact.  Yeah.  And he won a date...  Wow.  ...with a beautiful penthouse girl,  Lexi Love, today.  Nice.  So Bobo thought he was going to win,  but he did not.  I'm sorry, Bobo.  I'm not bummed out that I didn't win.  All right, let's go to Brian in Texas.  We'll just go straight to Brian.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, Sam Roberts, professional broadcaster.  Hey.  Pleasure to talk to you.  You too, buddy.  I learned a very valuable thing today  from someone very wise in the studio.  If you're silent, that is a time to learn. 
[04:41:30]  That's exactly right.  Today we did learn that.  Oscar, you were tired of Bobo talking today?  Yeah, man.  I mean, a little bit.  You were.  I mean, it gets exhausting.  Yeah, it's just...  I mean, people just run their mouths, man.  It's just like, shut up, man.  He talks a lot, too, doesn't he?  I mean, I'll be honest with you, man.  I mean, I don't have the greatest voice.  I mean, like the guy who called in earlier,  you know, I apologize.  Sometimes I get a little high-strung.  Keeping it real.  And then it just comes off.  What's nerve-wracking being on the radio?  What's the...  Sorry?  It's nerve-wracking, you know? 
[04:42:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Right?  No, plus, I need to pee so bad, too, man.  I'm sitting there.  And plus, that chair is not that comfortable, man.  And for a guy my size, too, man,  I felt my bladder was just being squished, man.  Well, you're 270 all muscle, right?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  270 all muscle.  He's chunky.  You don't know what it feels like  to have your bladder squished.  Oh, yeah.  You're right.  Yeah.  No, you're right.  I take that back.  That's right.  There's a person in you  kicking your bladder on the daily.  A little bitch.  Let's go to Nick in Phoenix.  What's up, Nick?  You're on the Post Show.  Yo, what up?  How's it going? 
[04:42:30]  Sam Roberts?  Good.  Yo, I'm a huge fan.  Oh, Peter.  Brady.  Why don't you make fun of him?  He's saying good things about me.  Sorry.  Yo, yo.  Sorry.  Hey, mom.  Sorry I have a cold.  That's okay.  Jesus.  Yeah, go ahead, Nick.  Well, sir.  Nick.  Are you okay, dude?  I'm sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Let that shit out, motherfucker.  Yeah, spit it out, man.  It's not yours.  Go ahead, Nick. 
[04:43:00]  Yo, I'm sorry.  Yo, Sam.  Actually, I love it.  This guy's good.  I was not a huge fan of yours,  but, dude, you have come into your own, dude.  You are a prime fan of Sam Roberts.  Oh, yeah.  And, like, after, like, dude,  I love O.P. Anthony.  For the past, like, four years,  I've been, like, a huge fan.  I can't stop listening.  But, dude, I'm sorry.  Okay, obviously, I've been drinking.  But, um, wow.  So, Nick in Phoenix. 
[04:43:30]  I mean, if I could turn Nick around,  I feel like I could turn anybody around, huh?  I mean, this kid is out of control.  Oscar, you think Nick was a little too nervous there?  Yeah.  Oh, shit, man.  Relax.  What's the deal?  A lot of stuff went down today.  If you didn't hear at the beginning of the show...  I didn't.  You keep in mind, a lot of you might have just tuned in  and heard the debacle of a dating game.  Denny and Bobo and Oscar coming in to save the day  at the last minute.  It's Oscar's first time in, like, two, three years.  But the show started with Ron Bennington in here  filling in for Ant. 
[04:44:00]  Yeah.  And, I mean, you get Opie, Ron, and Jim  just in here shooting the shit.  Good combo.  Talking about radio, talking about music,  talking about whatever.  It's terrific.  It's awesome.  Wow, look at that.  I love the air about you today.  You're in a great mood.  I know.  I'm always in a great mood.  Are you kidding me?  Look, Oscar's here.  How are you not going to be in a great mood?  Right, Oscar?  This guy's acting cute today.  Right?  What?  With the cuteness again.  Did you get laid last night, too?  I did not.  I was stuck in a hotel room again.  Oh, I'm sorry.  And I'll tell you this.  Somebody was supposed to be on this show today.  Yes. 
[04:44:30]  And he fucking texts me at 7.30 last night.  Hey, Jim, I don't think I'm going to even make it in tomorrow.  I have a sore throat and the weather's bad.  Who's that?  Stupid Bichetti, Mike Bichetti.  Oh.  And so I go through my...  I haven't talked to Oscar in two years.  Right.  Out of the blue, I text him.  And he's like, you know, it's going to be tough.  And he had to push his work back a little.  He's like, I don't even know how I can make it in.  I go, Oscar.  That's a nice guy.  Let me get you a car service.  Let me get you in here.  Wow.  And I was pulling all these strings and made it happen. 
[04:45:00]  Amazing.  Thank you.  No, thank you, Oscar.  My pleasure.  Look at what he delivered.  He brought his A game today, huh?  Let's hear, with everything that happened today, I mean, and the reason that I say that  is because not only was the dating game something to remember, as Denny said...  Right.  It was a part of radio history.  Okay.  It was.  Dennis Falcone did say that today.  Thank you, Denny.  I want to know what today's line of the day was, because if everything that happened before  the game, I don't know where it's going to land.  Well, is E-Rock picking it out?  No.  If E-Rock was picking it out, what would it be?  About Opie making fun of Opie. 
[04:45:30]  Yeah.  And Opie had a great show today.  Okay.  I think E-Rock would be like, sorry, no line of the day today, buddy.  Sal, what's today's line of the day?  Here comes line of the day.  Line of the day.  I could just talk to Oscar for an hour.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's Irish, dude.  You still drinking a lot, Oscar?  Oh, hell yeah. 
[04:46:00]  That was it.  Oh, hell yeah.  Oh, hell yeah.  Oscar can put out t-shirts.  After today's show, I think if Oscar put out Oh, Hell Yeah t-shirts, they would outsell  anything Stone Cold Steve Austin ever did.  They were great.  Oh, hell yeah.  Oh, hell yeah.  And tell Nicole what kind of drinking you do.  How many pints of Guinness do you go through?  I could do 14 pints in one night.  That's my favorite beer.  Really?  Mine, too.  Oh, shit.  They're going to fuck now.  Guinness is great.  When you say 14 pints in one night, are you talking about over the course of like eight  hours?  No, one and a half to two hours. 
[04:46:30]  I could do that.  Well, that's what's making you hefty, bud.  Guinness is...  Well, you're right.  No, absolutely.  Because it's empty calories.  You know, I don't exercise as much.  I mean, I try to walk as much as possible.  Good, good.  You know, you got to drink Guinness quick.  You can't let it sit.  When I was in Limerick, they were like, go, go, go.  Yeah.  Like, I thought, like, Guinness is something you drink slow because it's so thick.  No, you have to drink it.  It's heavy.  You can't let it sit, right?  You can't let it sit.  Dude, it's considered one, like, actually on the regular beers.  It's on the low-calorie count.  It is.  125 calories is my favorite. 
[04:47:00]  You guys all know it all.  Bobo, to you.  I like to say it's also more of a food beer.  You got to drink it with something.  Oh, shit.  Like, you know what?  Like, maybe when I go to Donovan's, I always...  No, I don't want to hear about Donovan's ever again.  A burger and a pint of Guinness.  Oscar's giving Bobo this look like, what the fuck is this guy talking about now?  All right, Bobo, don't make him feel like that.  Oscar, you think you need to eat a burger with a Guinness?  I mean, I've done it.  Yeah, but...  I've done it.  But is it necessary?  Well, yeah, later in the course of the night.  Later.  Oh, man.  It's because you're going to get the munchies and... 
[04:47:30]  Oh, man.  Now, tell me, Sal, what was your clip of the day today?  Yeah, well, it's kind of long.  All right, let me hear it.  Why are you mocking that?  Because that's exactly what happens.  Why are you mocking something that can happen that sounds really cool?  I don't understand that credit stuff.  What's your angle on this?  What does that mean?  There's always hidden BS, the fine print that they purposely made too small.  Why do they do that?  They tell you to put a thousand, then you have a thousand credit. 
[04:48:00]  What the fuck does that mean?  It's a debit.  Yeah, I don't know.  Some Russell Simmons shit.  Sal, is this the whole Bobo credit card rant?  Yeah, this is Bobo.  I'm not playing this.  Not today.  Maybe on the pre-show, but I'm not playing this again today.  Oh, fine.  But I will say this.  WhoKid, as much as people are like, oh, yeah, he's an idiot because he comes in here and  acts stupid, he deserves a fucking broadcasting award.  Because WhoKid comes in here and he tries to make radio out of anything.  There's a room full of tapped out guys in here.  And WhoKid is trying to make something out of Bobo talking about credit cards. 
[04:48:30]  I know.  I see what you do, buddy.  I like when you're on my dick, man.  Yeah.  That's not what I'm...  I mean, that's a black term now.  You're sweating me.  You're talking about metaphorically.  You respect me.  You're not actually touching his dick.  You're on the nuts.  Let me talk to Nomad in Chicago.  Hey, what's up, Prime Time?  What's up, Nomad?  Hey, Oscar, man.  Oh, wait.  Oscar.  Oscar, you just...  Oscar, you just said that.  He's talking to his car service. 
[04:49:00]  He's a big star tonight.  He's the man.  Oh, hell yeah.  Let me put you back on hold, Nomad.  And what was Travis's clip of the day today, Sal?  Well, Alexi.  I came with the bubble.  Very sexy.  Nice.  No one would have thought of that one.  I would love...  I'm not even thinking about rhymes.  I would love to take...  To take...  Take her out.  It'd be...  It'd be so...  It'd be so crazy.  Crazy.  Now rhyme crazy. 
[04:49:30]  You could do this.  But I would not be lazy.  Okay, good.  Oh, shit.  I would not be lazy.  Go with lazy now.  What do you got?  What do you got?  And I could tell you...  And with Lexi around,  no way this guy could be very hazy.  What the hell?  Romantic.  That really was nice, Bobo.  I think I could be very hazy.  Okay, stop going.  That really was nice.  Bobo and Oscar were put on the spot today  as part of the dating game  to come out with poems.  Bobo did that,  but Oscar ended up singing to Lexi in Spanish. 
[04:50:00]  Really?  Wow.  It was the most amazing thing I'd ever heard.  While I was beatboxing, too.  I like that.  It's a good combo.  I was spinning everywhere.  Nice.  I want to talk to Mike in Denver.  What's up, Mike?  How are you doing?  Good show today.  Thanks.  Hey, Sam, you made a believer out of me, too.  You've improved vastly over the past couple of years,  and I love it.  I mean, they're all hidden insults,  but I appreciate the compliment.  Yeah, I mean, I'll take the compliments  because they're few and far between in this world,  but it's all like...  Sam, I saw you last year in Chicago,  and you were a quiet, reserved little guy.  Yeah.  What a publicity.  And he's now on the air here. 
[04:50:30]  The exact opposite now.  I love it.  All right, well, thank you very much, Mike.  Hey, Bobo, I got an extra...  You've been complaining about this XM MP3 player.  I got an extra one.  I'm going to Twitter you tonight.  Oh, shit.  I'll send you one.  Is that true, Mike?  Yeah, I don't...  All right, let me put...  I'm going to put you on hold,  and then somebody's going to get your email address, okay?  All right.  Bobo, Mike in Denver just said  he's going to send you his old XM radio.  That's fucking great.  Right, his XM...  You can give me the email address, and I'll... 
[04:51:00]  Yeah, but that's what he said.  Just, yeah, why not?  Why not?  Why be grateful?  Yeah.  Thank you.  Oh, yeah, just send me the email address,  and I'll take it from you.  I'll say thank you, man.  Motherfucker.  I have to say thank you.  Yeah, right, yeah, right.  I'm sure Mike feels much better.  But I'd have to say thank you on the air.  The thing that nobody realizes is  when I came on the Opie and Anthony show, okay,  I was fresh...  I was still in college, right?  Yeah.  So everybody's had to see me grow  in front of the fucking biggest audience in radio,  except for one guy, maybe.  Possible.  And it depends on if something's going on in the summer. 
[04:51:30]  But you...  I mean, this is the second biggest audience anywhere in radio.  So, yeah.  You've all had to see my growing pains.  I feel like everybody's looking at you like,  you're so cool, little boy.  Sam, you got so good.  I'm glad that they're finally...  Is it safe to say metaphorically everybody's on your nuts now?  Everybody's on my dick, Luke, and I love it.  It feels good to have people on your dick.  You're right.  You're black.  I am?  You are.  Does it sound black?  You sound so black right now.  No, no, you don't.  I love all you people that stay on my dick.  You're scaring me. 
[04:52:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Give me your wallet.  Get off his nuts.  Can you see my dick one more time?  Get off my dick, Nicole.  Yeah.  This guy's like a black Fonz.  Are you going to turn on a little bit?  I'm so horny.  Just say it one more time for me.  I mean, if you just want me to talk about my dick.  You got her fallopians moving.  Bobo, we got a celebrity on the phone that's got some tips for you.  Bob Levy.  How you doing, Bob Levy?  Bobo, can you hear the phones?  Put some headphones on.  I need some headphones. 
[04:52:30]  Someone pass me some headphones.  Look at the table.  They're right in front of you.  Is he whining about headphones?  Yeah, he is.  What's up, Bob?  Bobo, can you hear me now?  Yeah.  Okay, listen to me.  Listen to me.  You, I know you.  I like you.  But you are whining like a fat chick that didn't get chocolate or flowers.  Okay?  Here's the problem.  Don't worry about it.  Look, a black guy won.  You know what he's going to do to that pussy?  You ain't going to be able to follow it.  Don't worry about it. 
[04:53:00]  You move on.  You do.  Bob, we got to let you go because I'm running out of time.  It's a real talk.  Okay.  All right.  Good luck, Bobo.  All right.  All right.  Thanks for calling in, Bob.  All right.  Bye.  Always a pleasure to hear from the great Bob Levy.  Look, Bobo, you didn't win this one, but I do want to wish everybody a happy Valentine's  Day.  Who could?  Thank you for being here.  Nicole.  Yeah.  Always a pleasure when you stop by.  Thank you.  I love you guys.  You only got a few days left, right?  I just can't wait to get that dick back.  Oh.  Wait till somebody gets that dick in you.  Nuts. 
[04:53:30]  Oscar.  Yo, what's up?  So good.  Wait, what did you say?  What was your line?  Oh, hell yeah.  Hell yeah.  Hell yeah.  So good to have you back.  Thank you.  We're going to, uh, you're going to go to work now, but we're going to figure out when we're  going to get this date done between you and Lexi Love.  Maybe something big will happen in Bobo.  I mean, there's a little much today.  I'm going to be honest.  There's a little much.  I know.  Maybe I went a little bit overboard with talking today.  Right.  Maybe we put you on the back burner.  Not for too long.  Because I love you.  You know I love you.  Yeah.  Physically.  Kiss him. 
[04:54:00]  I'm going to, I'm going to end the show.  I'm going to kiss you on the mouth.  Is that okay?  Well.  Can I do that for you, Bobo?  Can I kiss you?  I guess metaphorically you could.  No, no, no.  He's black.  He's black.  He's black.  He's black, ladies and gentlemen.  Black history, love.  And no matter what they said, that date and game worked.  Yeah.  Happy Valentine's Day, everybody.  We'll see you on Monday or Tuesday.  We'll see you on Tuesday.  Goodbye, everybody.  Thanks for listening to Opie and Anthony and the Opie and Anthony Post Show.
