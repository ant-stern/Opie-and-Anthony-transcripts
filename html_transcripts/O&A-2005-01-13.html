<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with the hosts nonchalantly discussing a large FCC fine resulting from their infamous sex stunt at St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Their conversation quickly shifts to their fatigue before diving into a lengthy discussion of *The Twilight Zone*, filled with reminiscences about favorite episodes and behind-the-scenes anecdotes.  This segues into a debate on the moon landing conspiracy theories, fueled by listener calls. The discussion then abruptly changes to the exorbitant cost of cigarettes in New York City, expanding into a critique of the city's aggressive tax collection practices, particularly concerning online purchases.  The hosts then complain about the various annoyances of Manhattan life, including homeless people, rats, and aggressive delivery cyclists.  The segment concludes with a story about a British Airways flight diverted because a passenger's name resembled someone on a no-fly list, followed by a discussion about the anxieties of flying over water.  Danny, the intern, is present in the studio throughout.  The entire segment is liberally laced with profanity and vulgar language.

The next segment continues the theme of air travel anxieties, with harrowing tales of turbulent flights and near-misses during landings.  This transitions to a discussion of a recent California mudslide tragedy, focusing on the bereaved husband's extensive media appearances and the ironic timing of the event (heâ€™d left to get ice cream just before the mudslide).  A comedic prank call to Marlboro customer service, featuring a caller feigning emphysema to request free cigarettes, is played.  The hosts then launch into a scathing critique of Whoopi Goldberg's perceived laziness and lack of effort in his radio show, contrasting it with their own work ethic. Listener calls reinforce this sentiment.  The segment also includes several "fuck you" calls, previews of upcoming comedy bits (Jim Norton as a "coffee diva," Anthony as a "potato diva"), a humorous call about sexual enhancement drugs before a brothel visit, and a discussion of Prince Harry's Nazi costume and the British line of succession, all interspersed with more listener calls and banter.  No guests are in the studio beyond the hosts.


The following segment centers around Prince Harry's Nazi costume scandal and an exploration of the word "fuck" in its various grammatical uses.  Tangents include listener calls, reminiscences about their former radio stations (WHFS and WNW), and a lengthy, sexually explicit fictional storyline about the *Lost in Space* characters Major West and Judy Robinson and Mrs. Robinson.  Notable moments include a caller, Frank, repeatedly claiming (unconvincingly) to love Nazis; a discussion of the surprisingly lenient reaction of some British Jewish organizations to Prince Harry's actions; an absurd discussion of the fictional "Java Log," a coffee-scented log supposedly popular in the gay community; and the playing of vintage cigarette commercials with overtly racist content.  The arrest of Jason, a friend of the show and alleged operator of a high-end call girl service, is briefly mentioned.  The hosts and their regular production team are in the studio.


The next segment begins with a detailed discussion of Jason's arrest for running NY Confidential, a high-priced escort service, on charges including drug possession, promoting prostitution, money laundering, and falsifying business records, along with the arrests of seven of his employees.  His criminal history, including past ecstasy smuggling and a felony stalking warrant, is detailed, along with mention of a reality show in development about his business and his supposed police connections.  The hosts discuss their past encounters with Jason and his associate, Natalia.  The conversation transitions to Craigslist, its use for finding prostitutes, and the efforts to remove explicit ads.  They express a desire to have Craigslist founder Craig on the show.  This is followed by a mocking discussion of the Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston breakup, contrasted with the California mudslide.  Audio clips of various celebrities commenting on the breakup are played.  A significant portion focuses on Marlon Brando, including his negative opinions of Burt Reynolds and his general contempt for acting.  The segment ends abruptly mid-conversation with Joe Rogan, who calls in to discuss the St. Patrick's Day incident, censorship, his religious views, *Fear Factor*, his car featured on *Rides*, and Bernie Getz, a frequent, eccentric caller with a history of unusual behavior, including a weapons charge.


The final segment begins with a call from Joe, an enthusiastic listener who compares the show to Art Bell's program.  Joe mentions his upcoming stand-up gigs, prompting a discussion of the hosts' schedules and projects, including Anthony's Tony Danza impersonation, which has caused security issues.  The conversation then shifts to a *Fear Factor* episode involving nudity and the resulting complaints, leading to a broader discussion about societal attitudes towards nudity and perceived hypocrisy.  The conversation touches on societal expectations of adulthood and the influence of religion.  Joe recounts his DMT experience with Doug Stanhope, detailing Stanhope's reaction and unhealthy lifestyle.  He also shares anecdotes from his time on the *Man Show*, including mentioning a trans woman named Vanity and a segment called "Make Me Hard."  The conversation is filled with vulgar language and sexually explicit references.

[00:06:30]  i wake up and i'm tired sometimes i don't go right to sleep and i'm still tired i it takes  it doesn't matter what time i really go to sleep i'm just going to be exhausted because it's early  i was i couldn't even i was watching the honeymooners because i got the you know the the box set  yeah the original 39 episodes and love it and i it was like eight o'clock and i i'm thinking i'll  watch a couple episodes of the honeymooners and then call it a night you know yeah i was like  don't i couldn't keep my eyes open at eight o'clock at night i know eight o'clock it was the one about 
[00:07:00]  maybe you can help me out because yeah it was the one about uh them hiring a maid yes that's very  funny i don't it wasn't funny oh i love it yeah yeah what what did you fall asleep during it yeah  off and on yeah so i gotta re-watch that one you think oh yeah yeah when they go har when he comes  in uh with a cigar trying to be a big shot oh yeah yeah yeah har har har har har har big shit  yeah why don't you love when he threatens physical violence on his wife that's great and then uh they 
[00:07:30]  take the maid home of course and she's a big bruiser you know who that woman is that plays the maid no  and that she's also in that episode of the twilight zone where um where uh this this earth is headed  toward the sun and uh everyone's like kind of burning up and the woman paints that picture  and the picture melts at the end and it turns out that she was just like in a coma or sleeping or  or something and actually the earth was going away from the sun and it was freezing out 
[00:08:00]  yeah she was the old broad that twilight zone crap just used to creep me out i love the twilight  zone i picked up all those too i picked up the entire box out of every twilight zone and you don't  realize how many they just don't play on tv there's hour-long episodes that they really don't play on  tv and there's there's quite a few of them it was just there was just great writing back then you  know really was because they didn't have the special effects and no the great acting it was just all  about really really good storylines that just got into your skull man some of the acting was pretty  good i saw one with robert duvall in it and uh yeah really good he's just he's really good and it was uh 
[00:08:30]  great writing you know like you said rod serling wrote a lot of those and um it was all it just  really wasn't anything that was happening back then either what's your favorite um twilight zone  episode god favorite jeez one that just sticks out in your mind a rough one i actually always liked  the one where um where they were at the diner and there was an alien amongst them and uh they couldn't 
[00:09:00]  figure it out because there was one too many people when they counted heads for the bus trip  uh that came into the diner and they were all snowed in so they couldn't leave because the  the bridge was going to be washed out or something and it turned out that there were two aliens in  there one guy was the guy behind the counter he took his hat off at the end of the episode and he  had the third eye uh on his head and the other guy had the third arm and he starts smoking a cigarette  and he puts one in his mouth pulls out the uh lighter with another hand and lights it with the uh  with his third hand and why was it bad that they had an alien amongst them uh well it was earth 
[00:09:30]  uh it was venus and mars fighting over who was gonna take over earth so you know we lose uh either  way around it right that one that one was pretty good i always like the ones where they're going  into space or some space episodes where they have a spaceship with uh for some reason back then  uh spaceships on tv shows what a waste of headroom you know it's like you see a real spaceship when when  they started getting into the 60s and nasa was sending people to the moon they'd shove people in 
[00:10:00]  these castles and everything that wasn't taken up by a human was equipment yeah but they'd jump in  there and you know hello there's a big echo like above their head is just they got cathedral ceilings  in a spaceship like they don't need any equipment up there that's hilarious that's hysterical i love  episodes like that i love old space stuff from like the 50s waste of headroom yeah even in the old  movies waste of headroom on the airplanes too oh yeah like wow i would love that much room when i fly  maybe some of the equipment could have gone up there you know we're really not doing these we're 
[00:10:30]  not breaking out a trampoline on this uh on this voyage waste of headroom that's classic yeah they  walk into this it's a room big echoey room a couple of dials on the wall and stuff some some bad  impractical seating and then just this a ceiling way up as high as you can see it that's very funny  yeah oh another one i liked was uh the old man in the mountain  the one uh where where there was a nuclear war which is always a great uh setting for a twilight 
[00:11:00]  zone when uh the post-apocalyptic episode and there was a guy that used to go up to the mountain  and come down with information on whether food was contaminated where they should plant food uh if  they should go in because it's going to rain soon and then james coburn pulls into town with some army  buddies and just screws the whole thing up he's a tough guy you know uh then starts beating on the  people and taking the women and and just saying uh you know who's this old man in the mountain screw  him let's eat the food what are you doing because they have the contaminated food and booze in a  building so they broke out all the booze and drank and stuff and uh go up in the mountain and uh 
[00:11:30]  decide they're gonna meet the old man it turns out to be a computer this big boop boop boop boop with  lights and stuff computers in those old shows are great too just lights and tapes whirling back and forth  it's supposed to be the future you know the future 1975 yeah 75 rod you should have pushed  this thing up a few more years blinking lights and and tape tape being spit out yeah that's it  spaceships flying and it's like you know this is the year 1995 oh it is really rod yeah kind of 
[00:12:00]  didn't happen they missed it by a little bit flying cars which we never had they have a few of those  episodes what what year is that oh it's 83 yeah sure rod okay yeah why didn't they just write a  2000 i don't know 2100 yeah lost in space was 1990 97 98 it was supposed to be jupiter 2 taking off  yeah no nothing no flying saucers we can't even get a shuttle that could work for a few years running 
[00:12:30]  without blowing up yeah but we got that thing that uh took off yesterday that thing thing that's  going to crash into the comet are we insane we love doing crazy are we sure this is going to be okay  it's not going to like set off some kind of like chain reaction in in the universe the scientists  insist it's okay you sure i guess so can't it start some kind of weird space tsunami thing i don't you  would think maybe oh well they're starting to get a little creepy with stuff because they're bringing  stuff back there was one ship that that went up nasa sent it up and uh it collected dust off a 
[00:13:00]  comet's tail and then brings it back to earth and uh that's a little creepy especially since this thing  crashed in the desert the chutes didn't open it was supposed to be grabbed by an airplane that was  flying over and the whole recovery system failed and this thing just crashed into the desert and i  guess the case that was holding this little wafer thing that picked up these particles from a comet  was exposed to the atmosphere you start thinking what are we bringing this crap back but that's what 
[00:13:30]  the atmosphere is for to burn this crap up before it gets to us and they're they're bringing stuff  back they could be bringing back some kind of space disease you know you ever you ever see uh andromeda  strain same thing we could all get powder for blood creepy they had that one ship that you were talking  about that went into uh it just launched i guess and they're they're sending this probe to crash into  the comet to get a uh it's called deep impact and they're gonna oh i saw that movie yeah movie was 
[00:14:00]  great i guess it was good enough to name a real satellite after yeah we humans love doing the  movie real life thing you know yeah it worked in a movie it was really cool so let's see like it worked  in the movie let's give it a shot let's give it a shot why not so they're firing this thing at this uh  this comet and uh it's because they want to see what's inside the comet for some reason  and people are saying well what if it you know shifts the orbit and you know kind of starts  heading towards earth oh no it won't happen we don't think if if it does divert the comet in any 
[00:14:30]  way it'll be such a small amount that no one blah blah blah i don't know maybe it's stuff we  shouldn't really screw in i think you gotta trust the eggheads though yeah yeah the eggheads uh got a  whole different thing going on than us yeah i guess they what they said was uh they need to know what's  inside the comet so that if ever a comet is heading toward earth they know what they're  dealing with and i thought we we took care of that with uh you know what it is drilling crew  yeah right there you go let's just do that again know what it is those scientists in nasa they're 
[00:15:00]  just bored well yeah what fun stuff can we do well we'll build a little uh a little thing and land  it on mars and let it ride around a little bit drive around yeah that was fun for about a month okay  now let's uh i don't know let's uh let's blow up comets let's go into comets the shuttle's still  down all right let's start uh shooting crap into comets yeah they're just bored down there yeah that's  all that is the heyday of that whole thing like is it really that important to to do a deep impact 
[00:15:30]  into a comet it's no one small step for man let's just put it that way the heyday was the 60s and 70s  you know as far as we never really and we didn't really land on the moon though space travel goes  oh you you're one of those yeah yeah well because the flag was you know blowing in the wind and  there's no wind on the moon you talk to people that are adamant about this that we never actually  went to the moon that was the one that but that was the one thing that freaked me out because i've  been on some of those websites like hey makes a good point the flag was blown in the wind 
[00:16:00]  but it wasn't it was just being it was when he he put it into the uh into the soil yeah he was  shaking it and the thing is on some kind of a little hinged arm because there's no wind to  actually hold the flag up and as he was moving it it started moving and when you leave it alone  there's no real real wind resistance or anything to stop it from moving it's momentum you know and  eventually it stops but it looks like it was shaking in the wind then there's shadows they go look 
[00:16:30]  one shadow's going one way one shadow's going the other way well because the lighting guy you know  messed up right on the set of the moon on the moon set but then they showed pictures of earth  they showed a picture of an intersection and say look this is what happens one shadow looks like  it's going one way one's going the other way because of a slight incline in the road your position  relative to the the thing that's casting the shadow uh so that was it was all dispelled really you  got to be a real kook to think we didn't go to the moon that uh more than three people can get 
[00:17:00]  together with a conspiracy and actually keep it and hold it together for so many years  that's that's the most incredible part of any conspiracy is that anytime you have a group of  more than three people that they could actually keep this thing going the moon like you know how many  people would take to fake it and they all just said all right you know shh  yeah remember that tattoo with an old nasa guys years later in a bar remember when we did that  thing yeah shh on the qt yeah no i didn't tell anybody no one did we're all so cool 
[00:17:30]  you'd want to tell someone eventually of course of course a deathbed confession something i love  the deathbed confessions no one fessed up well jimmy brought up the one the lock is monster  monster there's always a deathbed confession that comes out every once in a while  that wrecked it for me i i was you know as a kid growing up i was so into that you know the ufos  and uh nessie and and bigfoot and you'd get the books and look at all the pictures of ufos and stuff 
[00:18:00]  what was that a show when we were growing up in search of in search of that was a great one  leonard nimoy narrated that one didn't rod sterling do a show similar for a while or did he voice any of  those no he used to do the narration for uh jacques who still okay still in the men of the calypso  descended that's right that's right that's what i'm thinking great stuff yeah but that was in  search of some creepy stuff too yeah yeah i used to watch those all the time you know in search of  bigfoot was great channels to deal with of course you watched it in search of bigfoot in search of 
[00:18:30]  the loctis monster oh i love that they'd show that stupid film of the guy on horseback and bigfoot  walking by and they'd freeze it right when bigfoot turned his big hairy head it was a big bear with a  sweet face bigfoot wasn't he cozy creature cozy sweet creature little flame shoes on  zoom in enhance the picture yeah let's go to max in dallas hey max good morning what's going on guys  we're kind of waking up here for you kind of uh kind of a twilight zone bust myself uh i was uh reading 
[00:19:00]  somewhere that rod sterling did the majority of the writing for this show but what's really weird is he  didn't actually write it he recorded it on a tape recorder yeah and usually he was kicked back in a  lounge chair by the pool yeah he would record it all on a tape recorder and then give the tape to a  secretary who would transcribe everything he said oh wow i was curious too uh you guys have seen that  movie heavy metal i'm sure the old cartoon oh yeah of course stoned many times at the north port 
[00:19:30]  theater watching that one you know you know the part where uh the guy's chasing him around the space  station going stern i'll kill you i just thought that'd be pretty funny audio for the show but i  don't remember that one out later all right thanks max yeah we'll try to get that audio they got some  great behind the scenes stuff and uh extra footage you know because you need that whenever you sell a  dvd for the twilight zone collection got a lot of candid stuff they have rod serling actually pitching  the idea for the show the twilight zone to the networks on video on film and uh it's him really 
[00:20:00]  talking from the heart about the show and and and the writing and the actors and it was before the  first uh pilot episode i guess and uh what a genius that guy was always smoking though on that set  whenever they do that little cut that they would do they do the beginning of the show set up the  creepiness and then all of a sudden it's you know rods in the bushes somewhere and man he always had  that butt who didn't smoke back then everyone everyone was smoking they were showing a show they were on the 
[00:20:30]  dvd the whole dvd collection they got rod serling doing an interview and it might be david suskind  i'm not sure who it was uh but the set looked like an old 80s rock band was on stage you couldn't see  them you could not see the guy interviewing and rod serling they both were smoking it was a smoke  machine heavily it's like how could people watch this back then that's classic it would they were in a  fog in a fog it's hysterical to watch the good old days when they used to smoke on tv oh the tonight 
[00:21:00]  the old tonight shows because i got that box set too the old johnny carson's yeah really cool so i love  the old nostalgic stuff i love old television you know and and you get this uh tonight show stuff  and watch from the 60s uh 70s uh with a big wide lapels and a colorful ridiculous tonight show set  and the glasses of scotch and and you know and jimmy stewart's coming out and bob hope and and uh 
[00:21:30]  mel torme and they're all talking about vegas and all that all that crappy cliche hollywood stuff  it's great but and they're all smoking and drinking got dean martin coming out with bob hope  and uh they got scotch in a glass with ice and they sit down and they're drinking booze and smoking  on television and these were the guys that were the you know the heroes the cool guys let's bring  that back bring it back you want to let's start doing our show drinking and smoking and that was 
[00:22:00]  our new show yeah what what are we talking about we just didn't have the the goofy sports jackets and  we tried the drinking approach hero but it doesn't really work this early in the morning yeah yeah  usually police get involved well rumor has it sure rumor does have it that may have happened i don't  know that was uh uh quite a time in television they didn't care it wasn't like if everyone was  up in arms now you know they're trying to get smoking taken out of movies which i think is 
[00:22:30]  ridiculous there are characters in movies that their their character would smoke it's this guy would  smoke it doesn't mean look kids smoke the guy wrote it for a guy that smokes people smoke in real life  and for some reason these anti-smoking groups now want to we don't want smoking on the big screen  because kids watch it and they're influenced and just shut up what it's a character that's being  written by someone and again it's these stupid groups getting involved to screw with people's art  you know but back then no one cared it was a thing everyone did maybe on talk shows and movies on 
[00:23:00]  television shows not anymore you rare you rarely see a character that smokes on tv and they weren't  worried about saying the one wrong thing that was going to ruin their career because some corporate  faggot was going to become offended or some yeah you're going to protest that was another thing  freely it was great back then yeah all right let's go to mike hey mike hey guys how you doing  pretty good bro calm too oh by the way jim i just want to tell you real quick i think you're one of  the uh most original things going on in comedy right now and uh thanks mike uh anyway whatever 
[00:23:30]  that's worth i wanted to call and talk about a documentary i saw uh probably three or four  months ago regarding the moon landing and some of the theories about whether it really happened or not  a couple of things uh that i saw in there that i don't recall you mentioning were uh you know how  when you look at these lunar photos that they took and you see the crosshairs and i don't really recall  what the purpose of the crosshairs was but there are a couple photos where the crosshairs are actually  covered up by objects appearing in the photos uh for instance a flag covers part of a crosshair in one 
[00:24:00]  that's pretty interesting i'm not saying that we didn't go to the moon but it is  it's a nice little bit of conversation uh material and also there's no blast crater  yeah there really there actually is a blast crater it's not a crater because uh it wasn't enough  thrust to make a crater but you can see the dust from the surface was actually blown away  is that is that the case i did yeah and and and the thing about the crosshairs explain it and those 
[00:24:30]  are actually superimposed onto the photos to uh give you scale so they know they are but  if they are superimposed on top of the photos how could it be that an object within the photo  is superimposed over the not i don't want to use that's not the correct word to use but  how could it be that an object in the photo appears over the top of a crosshair yeah they  they actually explained that too it had something to do with the um the way the film was developed  they they actually had i read the whole site and they they had explained that one too 
[00:25:00]  if you got if you do like moon moon landing conspiracy search just put moon landing  conspiracy in google yeah you'll find a lot of answers to those things it's really ridiculous  for anyone to think that we didn't go to the moon you ever see capricorn one i don't want to say we  didn't go to the moon because i think we likely did but you know the people that think we did not go  to the moon there's a pretty valid reason for saying that there really isn't no they they'll tell you 
[00:25:30]  that there is but there's so much proof and and everything is explained and it's not explained  in a a cornball way it's it's explained you know it's like oh okay and it's scientists explaining  why this happened as opposed to the other side which is some conspiracy kook explaining why it  didn't happen you know i agree but at the same time we had a cold war to win and part of the reason  or part of the uh means by which a lot of people saw the cold war to be won was to uh show ourselves  or ourselves to have gone to the moon and uh and don't you think if we didn't that the russians 
[00:26:00]  would do everything they could to discount us actually going to the moon don't don't you think  they didn't have anything against us going to the moon you know absolutely i agree with you there but  another thing that a lot of these conspiracy theorists uh uh site and their uh and their laundry list of  evidence is that the scenery and the moon photos and the videos that was taken back and shown to the  people i'm sure i've been driving all night i'm tired uh it looks a lot like the high desert in 
[00:26:30]  nevada i mean as a matter of fact it looks exactly like it but at the same time it's dirt dirt dirt and  rocks that's what the moon's made of well i don't know so the problem was that the whole the whole  theory of the fourth astronaut lurking behind the sandy dune was really never discounted but it was  kind of speculated on it you know another another thing that's interesting that people say well how could  it be that a theory of that uh a conspiracy of this magnitude could ever be kept secret because i 
[00:27:00]  mean just thousands of people that literally worked on the project someone would have to have spoken but  a lot of the theorists that believe in this crap say well that that's very true but at the same time  the method by which nasa operated at that time and i guess it is saying today everything was very  compartmentalized and departmentalized so you would have a select group of people performing one function  not knowing what the other group of people was doing oh so they actually think we went to the 
[00:27:30]  moon too yeah sure and a very it's crazy right that it would only be a very small select number of  people who would have to be aware of the fact that we indeed did not go to the moon i love crap but at  the same time i don't think oswald was the lone gunman so you got to sit and think about it for at  least a couple of minutes yeah that makes for some fun yeah it's fun but yeah all right mike thank you  well before you let me go dude don't go yet because there was there was that one question  about whether we went or not people were saying that while he was supposed to be on the moon 
[00:28:00]  armstrong was seen walking around his neighborhood and going to nasa every day  i'm sorry say that one more time this is what makes uh jim's comedy so brilliant  thanks mike see you guys all right  all right they'll get it on the replay when he's awake let's go to steve in new hampshire  before we take a break steve what's going on today hey guys hey honey bunny hey you're talking about  smoking in the 60s a friend of mine back in the 80s had this old videotape it was all old tv 
[00:28:30]  commercials yeah and there was a great one with the flintstones for winston oh yeah i remember  seeing that like fred barney getting away from the women and like sneaking behind the stone wall for  a butt yeah hey winston is smooth fred yeah that fresh taste of winston cigarettes barney  it was like uh yeah and it was a real commercial how do they get you know imagine trying to get a  cigarette commercial on a cartoon oh you know like spongebob squarepants yeah having a cigarette 
[00:29:00]  all right punching out guys well that wouldn't work because you can't smoke in the water  no cigarette ads i actually as a real little kid i remember seeing cigarette ads on tv before they  pulled them off the i'd rather fight than switch tarryton ad and doral can we find those taste me  taste me we get come on and taste me take a puff and let me do my stuff we got them yeah dude we got 
[00:29:30]  a master computer here at xm satellite radio we might be able to find this stuff this type of thing it's  the old man in the mountain computer yeah it's whirling tapes and lights this computer is ridiculous  we might just be able to find it old smoking commercials nice there has to be a line i think  between like years ago where they just didn't care about your health at all yeah there's a point to  like how wrong that is on cartoons and and just these idiots over protecting you by not allowing it in  films oh they would and if you go back even further uh cigarette ads were that they were healthy for 
[00:30:00]  you it was like for doctors say for c for an agitated throat they would say you know smoke  cigarettes we got a project for our guys yeah the we got to find these old uh commercials yeah  yeah without a doubt well the problem is anthony has mentioned many times you can't give up any of  your rights because then you give up this it's like ah it's no big deal and then they and then they  go for a little more and a little more and a little more and a little more yeah the smoking thing on tv  i don't know as far as the commercials go uh i i have a hard time because i'm really for 
[00:30:30]  everything i like everything being available and presented to people to make their own decisions  um but then pulling cigarette ads off the tv that might have been a good idea that seems to be kind  of an evil that that could really be done away with the tobacco companies i think kind of did  themselves and i'm not being a self-righteous ex-smoker but they did lie for a long time so it's  kind of hard to be like hey we're a legal product and they're still saying like look there's no  real concrete proof that ah come on yeah it's it's pretty bad for you you know basketball on your 
[00:31:00]  lungs a coincidence i mean you got all those uh old hollywood types that were doing the commercials  for cigarettes years ago they would all do them and they all died of cancer and all those guys john  wayne john wayne was huge uh with the cigarette ads you know and dead he didn't make it uh duster wants  in as far as the moon conspiracy thing goes duster yes uh real fast because we got to take some kind  of break here okay uh i was just trying to figure out about the whole going to the moon thing you know 
[00:31:30]  if we ever did go uh why didn't we get back we went back from apollo 11 to apollo 17 and then apollo  13 they were supposed to do the moon landing and they had those problems oops what about now i don't think  we did to be honest with you my guess is there's really nothing we need from the moon that we can't  get with a probe it was finances back then too no one was really interested in going to the moon  anymore they actually had one more schedule they were going to do apollo 18 uh to the moon but they 
[00:32:00]  ran out of money so they wound up doing that little apollo soyuz meeting with the russians up there for  some cold war rah-rah look we're friends thing that must have been interesting and it probably went  into the space station and all the other things have been working that's probably where most of the  financing went was it was it just i don't think anybody cares about going on the moon hello apollo  now you dock your crappy american rocket ship up to us we open hatch and say hello try not to kill us  with your inferior equipment when we dock please because everyone knows russian ships so much better 
[00:32:30]  than american crappy lousy rocket ship please not to be bumping into a rocket with your bad  piloting skills that you lack because you're stupid america not great pilot like russia  awful russian ships they just look like it looked like septic tanks with rockets strapped to them  no design whatsoever oh no we're in washington and i think they had a russian they did they had a 
[00:33:00]  soyuz spacecraft and we went to the air and space museum it just looked awful and it's just this big  round thing it looked like a trailer look how durable a rocky ship is it looked like a trailer with  like booster rockets yeah that's it it looked like one of those old 50s style trailers you hook up to  a truck it looked awful all right we got a practical why don't we take a break anthony um  everyone knows this clip by now 
[00:33:30]  you hear it now right that's great  well uh our listeners uh you guys are great i mean you're really helping out the program on a daily  basis they're sending in all sorts of audio these days and video to help the program if you have  something you just send it to steve steve at foundry music dot com yeah send it right to him  okay yep but someone uh took that scream from the reporter and remixed it yeah it's kind of funny as we go to 
[00:34:00]  the break  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh 
[00:34:30]  oh  oh  Coming up next on Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton sings. 
[00:35:00]  Forget me not, you sightless taut, your dog just shit on my rug.  I thought that was pretty fucking funny, didn't you?  How's that for a sketch?  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  You don't do sketches, stupid.  Time to go to the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Oh, ha, ha, ha.  Get up, get mung it down with the sickness.  Get up, get mung it down with the sickness.  Get up, get mung it down with the sickness.  Open up your case and then there's no one to make it. 
[00:35:30]  Get up, get mung it down with the sickness.  If you mung it up, get mung it down with the sickness.  If you mung it down with the sickness.  That this is done, get mung it down with the sickness.  And we're back with the O.B. and Anthony program.  We may have found the old cigarette ads.  Yeah, a couple of them, maybe online.  All right, Steve's going to go search that out.  Politically incorrect.  Politically incorrect cigarette ads from back in the day.  Back in the days when it was correct.  But Jimmy brought up a point about what they're doing here in New York, Bloomberg. 
[00:36:00]  Like, they don't sap us of our money enough in this city.  You should see the taxes that people that live in New York City have to pay.  It's a completely different tax.  You know you pay your federal, most people pay their federal and state taxes.  Because there's also a city tax here.  You get taxed just for living or working in New York City.  So they're really raping people. 
[00:36:30]  Because it's such a privilege.  Oh, it's such a privilege to walk around with cabbies almost hitting you.  Dude, I can't wait to move back to the suburbs.  I can't wait.  I know.  I'm not even kidding.  I hate the city.  I like being close enough where there's things, if there's things going on, you can get in and then get out.  I like it for, yeah, I like it for the work thing where you wake up and you're 15, 20 blocks from work.  That's great.  Yeah.  But I hate it, man.  I need a backyard.  I need parks.  I need to go to the ocean or the beach. 
[00:37:00]  I hate this freaking Manhattan living.  Dude, I grew up in the suburbs, though, man.  I've been living here for like three years.  I like living in the city because I grew up in the suburbs.  So I think I had 30 years of that.  Sounds stupid, but I want to just drive to a mall.  I swear to God.  Ben's like shaking his head because Ben is all about Manhattan.  Ben is city guy.  Look at him.  He dresses the part and everything.  Ben is a total silly guy.  A city guy.  He is a silly guy, too.  Yeah, I got to agree with Ben on this one, man.  I like living in the city. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, I'm trying to buy a place.  I would rather have bought outside.  You get more for your money outside, but you like living in New York.  Dude, everyone that walks around Manhattan, they're all neurotic.  They all have.  There you go.  Jimmy.  They really are neurotic.  You can't have any real conversations with people.  They're all concerned about making their next buck, even though most of the people,  especially in Manhattan, have enough money for two lifetimes, but they just need more.  They need more.  They need more.  It's just a stupid, stupid way to live.  I don't like the living conditions. 
[00:38:00]  You know, I like a yard.  I like a house.  I like a driveway.  I like a garage.  I don't like, you know, I like being able to park my vehicle and not have to fork over  50 bucks when I'm done.  Dude, I'm lucky.  I got outdoor space, which is very rare in Manhattan.  Yeah, you have a backyard.  I have a backyard that is as big as this studio.  This studio.  And when people see it, they live in Manhattan, they freak out and they want to come.  They lose their minds, like, I can't believe you got this.  But the problem is, it's only as big as this studio, and it's concrete. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, it's all concrete.  I want a yard, man.  And it's surrounded by buildings.  It's surrounded by buildings and air conditioners and all sorts of buzzing noises and stuff.  And then little kids screaming and yelling because they're in their backyards because  they have nowhere else to go.  Yeah, what are they going to play out on the streets?  We're all claustrophobic in this city.  It's still nice, like, a little space.  It's nice for, you know, when you compare it to what other people have.  Yes, I'm very fortunate.  Okay, I found a really nice place.  Yes.  You're all stacked up. 
[00:39:00]  But, you know, I want the big backyard, man.  I want to drive my car into a nice driveway, open up the garage, drive it in.  How about this one?  You go into the supermarket, do a little shopping.  I don't want to have to unload from whatever you were in, whatever vehicle you were in,  into the lobby of your building, then into the elevator.  And then the guy that's coming in that needs to use the elevator while you're loading up, 
[00:39:30]  so now he's waiting, or you're waiting because someone else is loading their groceries on the elevator.  Now back up.  Oh, you get delivery?  Is that what you do, Ben?  Yeah.  Which costs more money.  You know, this sounds stupid, too.  I actually want to cook dinner every once in a while.  Ooh.  You just don't do that in Manhattan.  You spend most of your money eating out.  Eating out.  Most people...  Getting delivery.  I mean, the supermarkets in Manhattan, I mean, they're rare.  You can't find many.  Dude, takeout, especially this time of year, takeout in New York City is so huge 
[00:40:00]  that you can't even walk the streets from, let's call it, 5 at night all the way up to 10.  Know why?  Those freaking Asians on their bikes will kill you.  Dude, they're literally on Harry Carey on the other...  Kamikaze missions.  Kamikaze missions with their delivery bags.  Tie the little thing around their head.  And off they go with their little cart. 
[00:40:30]  They got their little basket in the front.  They got these sturdy bikes.  They don't care if it's snowing, if it's raining.  You know, this is how they make their living, and they're just going from apartment to apartment  with deliveries.  And just like the cabbies, you know, time is money, so they're not taking their time.  They're just flying down the streets.  How many times have you almost been taken out by one of these bike guys?  I mean, it's insane.  Go to Cross Street, it looks like Saigon.  Right.  And the reason is because, you know, no one is cooking at home. 
[00:41:00]  No one is shopping.  Everyone, you know, wants just fast, easy food in New York City.  That's what you do with your money.  Everyone's busy.  You go out to eat.  Everyone's very busy.  Or you get delivery to your apartment.  You know, I want to be able to go to a supermarket, get some food, and, you know, have a casual, you know, dinner at home.  If you buy stuff, yeah, you buy anything, food or anything, it's so nice to be able to back up to a garage door and put it right in your house. 
[00:41:30]  I just don't like what you have to do to live in an apartment building.  The elevator, the jerk-offs you live with, the person above you, the idiot below you, the garbage chute, the roaches.  It doesn't matter how nice you keep a place.  If your idiot next door is saving his piss in jars, you know, that's who you're living with, you know?  And they crawl through the walls.  Here's something.  I'm in a, you know, a smaller building.  I'm really fortunate.  I mean, I found a really nice place, but, you know, but you still have things to deal with. 
[00:42:00]  I think I have, you know, almost the perfect place, right, for myself, and that's that.  A little bachelor pad, right?  It isn't bad.  It's pretty nice, and you live on the ground floor.  But outside my bedroom, the homeless sleep.  Yeah.  You can't win.  It doesn't matter how nice it is.  You hear them pissing.  You hear them snoring.  You hear them going through the garbage.  Yep.  I see some of the homeless guys wearing my stuff around the neighborhood because I'll throw out some old clothes or something. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, and then you see them the next day.  Dude, that looks familiar.  I'll leave stuff out on top of the, you know, the garbage pails now.  Yeah, just for the homeless people?  Yeah, I'm like, well, I'm not using this shirt anymore or whatever, and I swear to God,  it's happened a couple times where I see some of these guys wearing my stuff.  It doesn't matter how nice your place is in the city.  But what I was going to say, let me finish the thought real fast.  If I'm in the suburbs, I don't think the homeless are going to be sleeping outside your bedroom window.  No.  It doesn't matter how much money you spend on your place in the city.  Even celebrities that move in here, because now the meatpacking district is huge with the celebrities. 
[00:43:00]  They love it.  And they're turning these old, like, lofts into these grand apartments.  And what do they got, Ben?  Ben knows.  He knows everything.  The biggest rat problem in the city.  Rats, dude.  Big ones.  You're buying $5 million, $10 million places.  You're a huge celebrity.  You go in there, and you're dealing with rats the size of big cats that are walking around.  Yeah.  It's all meat.  Well, yeah, and there was no building up. 
[00:43:30]  And actually, the hotel that Jason got busted, which we'll get to later, they had a major rat problem.  There were rooms like $2,000 a night, and there were rats coming out.  People, I think, some major actress, it was in the paper, was staying in her bed, and the rat came out of the hood of the oven.  Get out of here.  And jumped out of her bed.  It was over the summer.  Whoa, nice.  That's crazy.  But if you walk around the meatpacking district, you will see rats the size of cats.  Yeah.  Huge.  I've never walked around down there.  No, not Jim.  You've never been down around there. 
[00:44:00]  No, I've never walked around there.  No, he'll just drive through the area.  Yeah.  For hours.  Remind me.  At four in the morning.  No, you.  Remind me to tell you when you guys are.  All right.  What?  I was driving.  I went to 14th last night to make a ride on 8th.  Yeah.  So I was coming from the Comedy Cellar, and this homeless guy is looking at me in the window,  and he's dancing because I have my music playing, and he's dancing up a storm, and I'm like,  ugh, it's Tippi Tom.  Oh, our old pal Tippi, huh?  Yeah, he's dancing in the thing, so I rolled down the window, and of course he doesn't recognize me. 
[00:44:30]  I'm like, hey, Tom.  He's like, how do you know me?  And I tell him, you drunk.  You sot.  I'm like, I was on the Opie and Anthony show with me.  He goes, yeah, remember we did that a couple years ago?  A couple years.  You have no recollection of coming up here recently.  None.  And I saw you gave him 20 bucks, and he thought he'd hit the lottery.  He was the happiest man on earth.  We kind of got started here with this Bloomberg.  Bloomberg, yes.  Bloomberg, above and beyond all the expenses you have living in this city, cigarettes cost an arm and a leg here. 
[00:45:00]  What's a pack of cigarettes go for in New York City now?  Seven bucks?  And that's cheap.  I've seen it up to like nine, eight, eight, nine bucks.  Seven dollars for cigarettes, and it's all taxes.  It's all taxes.  So people have been buying cigarettes online.  You could get them for like a buck fifty a pack online.  Now they're sending out letters to people that have bought online.  You don't think people are keeping tabs on what you're doing.  The New York City Department of Finance has obtained information. 
[00:45:30]  Is this Spitzer again?  No, this is Bloomberg.  Mayor Bloomberg.  Okay.  Because doesn't Spitzer take care of all this like crap?  Yeah.  He's always looking for ways to just F with your life.  Yeah.  He tries to help people though sometimes.  Whatever.  The New York City Department of Finance has obtained information from cigarette retailers  that you purchased over the internet and received delivery in New York City  of 67 cartons of untaxed cigarettes during the period of between 2002 and 2004. 
[00:46:00]  This is Andrew Hoffer, I guess, got this letter.  Purchases of such unstamped or unlawfully stamped cigarettes require the consumer to pay the  New York City tax on the cigarettes.  Please use the envelope provided to send a check or money order in the amount of $1,005  payable to New York City Department of Finance.  Come on.  So now they are getting information from these cigarette retailers that sell over the internet. 
[00:46:30]  And sending these letters out to people that have bought cigarettes online asking for money.  Why would you give that info out if you're the retailer?  The city must have squeezed them for the info somehow.  The city now probably gets information from these retailers by threatening them in some  way, shape, or form.  You know they don't want to give it up.  Yeah.  For selling untaxed cigarettes.  And now they get your name.  They get your information.  And now they're sending out bills. 
[00:47:00]  You find a way to just save a couple of bucks and these scumbags swoop in.  Yep.  You've got to get their share.  Why don't they go to the education system and do a little bit of fixing up in there and  then give us some of the money back that they've been wasting for the last 20 years.  Oh, the waste that goes on.  And it's not just the education system.  Forget it.  You could find billions of dollars in waste that goes on in this city.  But that's business as usual.  Squeeze the poor sap that's just trying to eke out an existence by smoking, eating food, 
[00:47:30]  drinking booze, whatever.  Ugh.  You know, just something that might give you a minute of enjoyment in life.  Just slam that poor son of a bitch.  Yeah, you do find a way to save a couple of dollars.  Yeah.  And he's a...  Bloomberg annoys me because he's a billionaire.  Yeah.  It's like, dude, you're so out of touch with anything that regular people require or deal  with.  Oh, he tries.  Look, I'm riding my bicycle to work today.  Yeah.  You're not.  It's a photo op.  He tried to find... 
[00:48:00]  Well, who was it?  Richards of the Rolling Stones?  Yeah.  Who's smoking on screen at Madison Square Garden?  It's like, you goody two-shoes.  Is that the best you have to do?  Are you kidding me?  Giuliani was cleaning up all these garbage and pimps and, you know, not to mention bad  people that were causing a problem in primal...  What do you call it?  Claudio.  He's worried about that, but I was going to bring this up last week.  Speaking of the homeless people.  Yeah.  You know, we got the nice homeless people in our neighborhood.  They're all over the city, obviously.  I saw a guy just walking down a nice street on the Upper West Side, and I'm behind him 
[00:48:30]  coming home from the gym or whatever, and I see him just take a sharp right.  I'm like, what the hell is this guy doing, you know, because it looked a little weird?  He pulls his pants down and just starts leaking into someone's garbage can.  Like, it was nothing.  Dude, in full view of everyone, like, people walking their dogs and the nannies with their  kids and whatever, you know?  That's what you pay for here in New York.  He drops, drop.  He's completely now naked, because, you know, it's not like, you know, most guys, if we're  taking leaks in public, well, you know, you just pull down the front of your pants 
[00:49:00]  a little bit.  He's one of these guys that has to pull the whole pants down.  Do you have golden buns on?  I didn't look that close.  And he's got his mule out, and he's just peeing in this whoever's garbage can it is that just  happens to have it out in front of their place like it's no big deal.  And then zips up and just starts walking back down the road.  There would just be stormtroopers around that just pummel people that do that.  Just pummel them with nightsticks.  No, but...  Unbelievable.  You know, but, you know, the... 
[00:49:30]  Whatever.  Yeah, you want to eke out a little existence in life.  You want a couple of moments of enjoyment with your drink or your cigarette or whatever.  And just tax, tax, tax.  Let me, uh...  They have to come after you, don't they?  Yeah.  I understand that eventually it's going to be a major problem and everybody's going to buy  online.  So maybe they have to start saying stuff like, look, from now on.  But you don't go after a guy for back taxes.  You have to be such a douche.  If you want something, people will find a way.  And, you know, oops, sorry. 
[00:50:00]  What are you going to do?  I don't think they should be able to tax them.  I think if you could find a way to buy this stuff untaxed, fine.  Yeah, I agree.  Screw it.  All right.  Eric from California, could you stay through the break?  Yeah.  All right, cool.  Eric needs some advice from Jimmy.  Oh, sure, Eric.  Real fast, Danny, the intern, is in the studio.  He was telling me that his cigarettes were intercepted from Sweden.  You were in Sweden flying home?  No, no, no, no, no.  Oh, when you went there?  No, I was ordering from a website.  Online.  Online.  From Sweden.  Oh, okay.  You went online, found somewhere in Sweden where you could get cigarettes cheap, and they 
[00:50:30]  were going to ship them to you.  Right.  Okay, gotcha.  When a young boy brings them to you, you get to keep him, too.  It was cheap as anything.  I mean, here in the city, seven to eight bucks, I was paying $1.50 a pack.  $1.50 a pack.  You know, $15 a carton.  You can't go wrong.  So I ordered my cigarettes.  I'm waiting probably about two, three weeks.  They're not coming yet.  But finally, I read in the paper that the company that shipped them out, the whole entire shipment  to the U.S. was intercepted.  Either JFK or LaGuardia, I can't remember.  Yeah. 
[00:51:00]  That's what they should look for.  You know, but they did charge my account, even though they were intercepted.  Of course they did.  I'm still out $50.  I never got the cigarettes.  Oh, is that from the Lufthansa heist?  That's how James came.  We got the cigarettes!  And the shower pounded on the wall.  Oh, that's a good one.  Jimmy!  Very nice.  Now I've got to pay $7 for a pack of cigarettes, which I can't afford.  What are you doing with those cigarettes?  What are you doing?  I told you not to smoke the cigarettes. 
[00:51:30]  My wife loves these tipperillos.  Take them back.  Take them back.  All right.  Give me, I need those cigarettes.  Fuck him, cigarette hijacking Mick.  What am I, a schmuck on wheels?  You're going to talk to Danny, the intern, like that?  Here we go, dude.  This is going to last 20 minutes.  This is a 20-minute thing, man.  Unbelievable.  They intercept cigarettes on their way.  How about you look for other things that are coming from overseas 
[00:52:00]  that might be a little more dangerous to everybody  than someone's discount cigarettes?  It's like uncircumcised exchange students.  How about stopping them at the border?  Or double-checking the people that are on a plane?  On a plane before it gets halfway across the Atlantic  and has to turn around.  Have you heard this story yet?  Well, they didn't want...  The U.S. did not demand they turned around.  That was British Airways.  No, they wanted them to land in Bangor.  Well, what's the story?  Because people, you know, they haven't read the paper yet.  There was a flight coming over from Heathrow.  Yep.  And when they got halfway across the Atlantic, 
[00:52:30]  they noticed that somebody on the flight was on the United States no-fly list.  You know, they got a whole list of people that...  Not necessarily terrorists either on this list.  They're people...  Some people that just have dealings with people that are suspect of being terrorists.  And it turned out that the guy that they took off the plane  had a name that was similar to a guy that was on a list.  So it wasn't even a guy.  They get halfway across.  They notice, uh-oh, here's this guy on the list.  So England tells the United States that somebody on the list is on this plane. 
[00:53:00]  They say, okay, divert the flight to Bangor, Maine,  instead of it was supposed to land at Kennedy, I believe.  Oh, they went to Maine?  They didn't go all the way back?  No, no.  They were supposed to go to Maine.  And then England, instead of going to Maine, said,  no, we'll just turn it around.  Can you imagine being on that flight,  and then you just feel a sharp left banking?  That turn.  Over the ocean.  Over the ocean.  No, they don't have to turn.  Yeah, it's a straight flight.  It's like point A to point B.  Yeah.  Maybe a couple little things here and there,  but not that sweep-winged little U-turn that they make. 
[00:53:30]  If I was on that flight, I would sue, I would sue, I would sue.  Because, you know what?  They told the people, I think, that it was engine problems.  Now you're freaked out.  Engine problems?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  So now you're on this plane.  Have you done the flight, well, over the ocean?  Oh, yeah.  I did that coming back from Greece a few years back.  And it is just, I hate flying to begin with.  It is just a scary, scary feeling to be over the ocean for, I don't know what,  at least four or five hours on that flight. 
[00:54:00]  It just is a creepy feeling.  Because in your head, when you're flying, let's say, from California to New York, I understand  that if the plane crashes, most likely you're not going to live.  But it's a psyche thing.  Like, you see land, and you're like, maybe there would be a chance.  And that pilot could make it.  Like an engine, like the dude we were talking about yesterday that landed in the cornfield.  You're like, maybe there's a chance that I would survive something.  And there's airports everywhere.  Right, right.  You look down, there's airports everywhere.  Exactly.  So if you get a problem with an engine, you have only, let's say, ten minutes left. 
[00:54:30]  Right.  There's a chance you can, you know, make it.  You can figure something out.  But when you're over the ocean for four or five hours, man, I mean, your brain just starts  thinking stupid crap.  How many times is that engine spinning?  Oh, dude, I was having anxiety attacks like you wouldn't believe it.  You just look out the window, and you see nothing but water for hours on end.  And you're like, look, even if it's a minor problem that, you know, if you overland, like  you said, you could get to an airport, no problem.  But you know anything, I mean, anything goes wrong over the water, you're so screwed.  Let your mind rest with ease just thinking about all the people that have been plucked from 
[00:55:00]  the ocean after a plane crash.  How many times have they gotten survivors in the ocean?  I will say, though, rare.  I think the number would be zero.  When is the last time a plane went down like that over the ocean, like just for technical  mechanical problems?  I cannot remember.  Mechanical problems?  How about Pan Am?  That was an explosion.  Or, no, over Lockerbie.  That was a terrorist.  That was in the ocean.  No, TWA.  An explosion.  It wasn't terrorism, though. 
[00:55:30]  That was a mechanical problem.  And more conspiracy theorists will start popping up.  That was the Navy.  They were firing a guy in row C-5.  Five C, stupid.  In row C-5.  But that was a mechanical problem.  No, dude, I think what Opus is talking about is it's more of a paranoia.  A paranoia that overcomes it is what I'm saying.  Because I know, like, whatever.  You crash, you crash, you're dead.  Well, you're not talking about, he's not talking about an explosion.  You're talking about, like, a problem where they go, oh, we're going to have to put her  down and just get this fixed.  Oh, right, right. 
[00:56:00]  And whereas in over the ocean, you don't have that option.  Yeah.  Explosion's an explosion.  You're dead anywhere.  If you're over, you know, Duluth, you're dead.  But getting back to the story, so now, you know, the pilot says we have engine problems,  we have to turn around.  Holy ass, I'd be out of my mind.  Now you're freaking out thinking engine problems.  Are we going to make it?  That's all you think.  Are we going to make it?  Just say there's somebody on board that is on a no-fly list.  Yeah.  Now everyone can go peeking around, play games, who is it?  Just tell them what seat he's in.  Yeah.  The guy in C5.  Improv zilch. 
[00:56:30]  The darker-skinned gentleman with the rag on his head.  Yeah.  Oh, potential terrorist.  So they turned the plane around.  Yeah, they had to turn around.  What a bitch that would be.  You're halfway through your flight.  You know when you're on those planes, you're just looking at your watch going, all right.  Halfway there.  And now the rest of the time that you would have spent getting to New York is just spent  getting back to where you started?  Ugh.  Six hours late at least.  Oh, and then they take you off, and then you've got to get back on, and now start all 
[00:57:00]  over again.  This guy, Rob, makes a great point that I thought about, too.  Rob from Long Island.  Go ahead.  What's up, guys?  Hey, Rob.  How are you doing, Jellyfish?  I'm good.  How are you?  I'm not bad.  Yeah, over the summer, I was in Puerto Rico, and one of the scariest parts about flying over  the water is you can't really tell where, like, the water ends and the sky begins.  Yeah.  It's just together, you know?  Or you're just out there.  You can just be descending the whole time and not even know how close you are.  So, like, you see the reflection of the clouds over the water, and just everything just looks  like, just blue. 
[00:57:30]  It's a very scary sight, you know?  That might have been the thing that did JFK Jr. in.  I was just thinking of that as you said.  They think that actually is.  Oh, the haze.  Yeah, the haze got him.  But he's so right.  When you're flying over water, you're like, oh, my God, does this pilot know what's going  on?  I can't figure the sky and the water thing out.  We dropped through.  When we landed at Kennedy, when we came back from Vegas, we dropped through the cloud layer,  which was really low.  And you're in clouds, which is a little, you know, a little nerve-wracking when you  just have no view, because you know the pilot's got the same view of just cotton candy in 
[00:58:00]  his windshield.  But he knows what he's doing, the instruments and stuff.  But when you drop through that cloud layer, we were so close to the water when we dropped  through.  It was like, you see the ships, these huge cargo container ships going, and you're right  over the top of them.  A little creepy when you're over the water.  I got two really quick stories.  I could trump that.  We once landed where we never got out of the clouds, because I guess there was clouds  and fog.  I don't know.  Oh, yeah.  And all of a sudden, we hit the runway.  Holy S. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, you don't even know where it is.  You're just in the clouds.  Also, I'm just assuming, like you said, you're going to drop out of the clouds.  You'll see the ground.  All right.  Then you can take a deep breath.  I hate flying like Jimmy.  And all of a sudden, we just hit.  We just hit.  You get that thud of a landing.  I'm like, holy crap.  You don't know what it is.  The idea that we were only up, whatever, 100 feet off the ground, you know, and finally  hit the runway.  That's great.  And then the worst experience ever.  I was actually on a flight where half the plane starts screaming, bloody murder.  No joke.  I thought I was dead, dude. 
[00:59:00]  I was convinced.  O.J. on the plane?  This is it.  Jenna?  No, I was coming back on our hiatus on JetBlue.  L.A. to New York, and right outside New York, nasty thunderstorms.  This is where the pilots, they have to explain.  They just have to explain what's going on a little better.  Like, they know we're going into a front or whatever, I guess, and they know it's going  to be quite bumpy and maybe.  Or maybe really bumpy.  I don't know.  You know, if they could just calm you down a little bit, go, and look, you know, the  next five minutes could be a little crazy, but don't worry about it. 
[00:59:30]  It's normal, and we know how to get through this.  They know all this stuff, but they've been through it so many times.  Ah, they don't have to tell you.  Why do they have to tell you?  They're going to be fine.  They understand it.  So, out of nowhere, dude, we hit turbulence that the whole plane went up on the right side.  I don't know how.  I could exaggerate.  I don't know.  But it felt like at least a 45-degree angle, if not higher.  Nice.  Like a blast on the...  It felt like we got hit by something, is what I'm getting at.  Like, I don't know, a missile, another plane.  I don't know. 
[01:00:00]  But it was such an impact from the right that pushed the whole plane upwards a bit.  How high, I don't know.  I don't want to exaggerate.  But enough where everyone grabbed the seat in front of them and started screaming.  Nice.  And then I'm like...  You want screaming on a plane.  And then the thought in my head is, this is how it ends.  This is it.  It's over.  Oh, wing over.  It's over.  Nose in.  And then all of a sudden, I don't know.  I don't know how long it lasts.  I have no idea.  I just was convinced, holy crap, the plane is severely damaged and this is it.  This is how it ends.  Did he come on and say something? 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  Well, finally, then it was real bumpy.  And then he got the plane back, whatever, stabilized.  And then finally came on and said, sorry about that.  We hit a front or whatever he said, bad turbulence, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And everyone's looking around just like breathing a sigh of relief like, holy ass.  Creepy.  But it was, I mean, it was smooth as hell.  And then all of a sudden, out of nowhere, BAM!  Like, you didn't expect, you know, sometimes when you're in turbulence, it starts a little  bumpy and then it gets a little rougher and you're like, okay, I can sort of handle this. 
[01:01:00]  Kind of eases you into it.  Dude, this came out of nowhere where we just got hit, like something collided into us.  You know, I just got to jump on to it.  When you said the fog thing, it made me think.  I had a flight I was taking, not commercial like you boys take, when the military was flying me  around a war zone.  All right, calm down, calm down, war zone.  You are a brilliant comic.  No, no, while you enjoyed the safety of America, I was over there, you know, helping out troops  with a guy for our ride to enjoy freedom.  While you two were lounging on your vacation.  All right, I get it. 
[01:01:30]  I was, we were actually going to Ballad to land for a New Year's Eve show.  And the fog was so bad that it was 100 feet off the thing, off the deck, as we say.  Off the deck, of course.  Over, over in theater.  And the pilot gets on, and I was very nervous flying in the C-130s because you're a target.  And the pilot goes, oh, look.  No, actually, there was no announcement.  All of a sudden, we just start going back up.  Uh-oh.  To the guys in the back.  I'm like, oh, no, what's good.  There are guys looking out the windows to make sure that you're not fired at.  Right. 
[01:02:00]  And they're like, yeah, man, we got to make our landing somewhere else.  He can't see the runway.  So we have to divert to Mosul, which is a very, very hot zone.  Back then, it was brutal, so we had to land in Mosul because of the fog.  And I'll think of all this lovely flying stuff while I'm on my plane this afternoon.  At 2.45, I have a flight to Chicago.  Chicago.  I'm not going to talk about stupid zanies tomorrow on Saturday.  It's not important.  The fact is, I just want to get there safely.  847-549-6030.  Is there a couple zanies, though, in Chicago? 
[01:02:30]  I'm going to Vernon Hills.  I'm going to Chicago.  I'm going to Vernon Hills.  Vernon Hills.  Vernon Hills.  Go see Jimmy if you're in Chicago in the middle of the winter.  It should be fine.  That's why I'm flying in today, because I don't trust the weather.  I don't think there's any problems.  Oh, no?  Oh, you can have a lot of problems.  No, I don't think.  You'll be fine.  How annoying would it be if everything you said, like, sarcasm, I just address seriously?  No, no.  No.  You could.  Well, that's what Lady Di does, so.  That's what I do?  Shut up.  I listened to the replay yesterday, by the way. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, I know.  That line, because the judge says I'm not a-sposed to.  It was such an inside Shining line, but that hit me in the stomach.  I'm supposed to.  Yeah, I mean, I thought it was going to be just another crappy phone call from Lady Di,  but the Shining thing just...  Gotta love that movie.  Put it over the top.  I can't get enough of that movie.  I watch it whenever it comes on.  Even if it's cut on stupid TBS, I'll still watch it and get aggravated when they cut things out,  but I have it on DVD, too, and I'm constantly popping it up.  It's still scary.  There's still moments in that film that you're like, ugh. 
[01:03:30]  Those twins, those little girls, when they pop into the hallway, it scares the crap out of me.  Oh, the video of the morning is the best, man.  Oh, the ice video?  Yeah, you see the girl...  What the hell is this girl doing?  The dopey girl almost gets hit by a car.  Did you see the one that saw it coming and jumped out the passenger?  Was that her?  Yeah, he bailed out of the car.  He bailed out of the car.  It's the famous, you know, icy roads, and one car's slowly sliding into another.  Yeah, and you think you can handle and stop in time, and all of a sudden you realize full brakes are on,  and your car is not stopping.  Yeah, so the guy is like, one of the guys just barrel rolls out of his own car, or the 
[01:04:00]  passenger does.  I don't know, I've got to see the video again.  It was a passenger and left the car.  He's like, F this, I'm out of here.  It jumps out.  And they're doing five miles around.  Oh, I know.  It's like, dude, you're not doing, it's not the Autobahn.  It's not Mannix.  Tuck and roll out of the car.  Faggot.  Well, no, I think he knew it wasn't Mannix, just because he knows there's no cameras or anything.  All right.  I'm a literal idiot friend.  Anthony, I found something.  We were talking about cigarettes as we go to break.  I don't even know if it's funny anymore.  It seemed to be funny at the time. 
[01:04:30]  It's from our Dementor World CD.  Emphysema call.  Emphysema call.  Wow.  I have not heard this probably since it was done.  Yeah, I don't even know if it'll work, but we'll give it a shot.  We'll try things.  But basically, I think it was Marlboro called me to give me like, to wish me a happy birthday  or something.  Really?  Remember this?  Cigarette companies were doing call-outs?  Yeah.  And it wasn't my birthday, but I guess it was their way to, I don't even remember.  We should just play this. 
[01:05:00]  But basically, they're trying to-  They stopped cigarette companies from doing all this stuff.  They're trying to basically get me to smoke more or something like that.  They gave out the-  Because remember, you used to be able to collect the-  Miles.  All right.  Yeah, that's what this is all about.  They're trying to tell me what I could get with all my miles or something.  I don't know.  This is the worst-  A jacket or a wrap.  This is the worst setup I've ever done.  I don't even remember this call.  It probably blows.  You want to see Marlboro Miles go to Voss' house?  That ass has everything they've ever offered.  Really?  I got the camera.  I got the watch. 
[01:05:30]  Everything with this stupid Marlboro logo on it.  Just bright red.  It would be a nice jacket if it wasn't bright red and looked like a Marlboro box.  Yeah, you ass.  Voss tomorrow?  Yes.  Nice.  So, dude, it turns out, really fast, because I'm looking at the video, it looks like either  Millie or Vanilli lost his family.  Oh, my God.  It turns out-  Oh, my God.  Yeah, it's awful, dude.  All three of us.  No, it's an awful story that I didn't even know Millie or Vanilli was married, but he-  Oh, Jesus.  It turns out that he lost his wife and his three children in the California mudslide. 
[01:06:00]  Just the worst thing ever.  His one daughter did live, though.  He's got a 16-year-old.  Look at the news.  The news is just the worst.  Yeah, they got to put this guy on.  Let's just show his pain over and over and over again.  Well, this guy seems a little too open to the media.  I hate to be critical of the poor guy.  He lost his family, but, you know, he's really been on- he's gotten a lot of face time during  this tragedy.  Yeah, you know what?  Instead of talking to all the reporters, why don't you get a shovel? 
[01:06:30]  You idiot.  He did.  He was helping.  He was.  He was helping the rescue efforts for hours.  He was helping.  Yeah, well, I don't know that, because I've just seen him interviewed over and over again.  You know how many shovelfuls he could have taken care of instead of doing that interview?  Now he's got an exclusive interview on the Today Show.  That might not be Today, though.  Maybe.  It could be yesterday.  I don't know.  That is just hard.  No, honestly, it is tragic.  I don't mean that.  You know what happened?  Did you hear the back story on that?  Uh-uh.  He left the house to get ice cream.  Yep.  Get the F out. 
[01:07:00]  And he was out of the house when it happened.  And then Mud Sly comes, kills his whole family.  Well, he's still got a 16-year-old daughter left.  But, yeah, kills his wife and three kids.  He comes back from getting ice cream.  And just another example that there really is a God.  There is or isn't.  But there is.  We have a God, and he has a sense of humor.  A real dark sense of humor.  Holy S.  And people will tell him, look, I guess I believe in God.  I don't know.  But people will go, you know, it's all part of God's plan.  Really, your wife and three daughters are just smashed in mud on the couch. 
[01:07:30]  That's part of a plan.  What plan is that?  Jackass, you sick F.  Nice plan.  Religious people never, this is a problem I have with religious people, and I believe  in some kind of a plan sometimes, whatever.  But the fact is that they never allow just for random awfulness, which has to fit into  the picture somehow.  It's got to be part of a plan.  I'm sorry.  God didn't at one point go, all right, look, you three of you on the couch, you get ice cream.  I'll kill them with mud.  I'll leave the one.  It just doesn't work out that way.  I'm sorry.  I believe in something. 
[01:08:00]  When the roof collapses on a church?  I believe in something.  I just don't think it's been explained yet.  Explained in full?  Oh, I believe in something.  Yeah.  But I just don't know.  You don't know what it is, though?  Not really.  Yeah.  That seems to be the quandary everyone on this planet's in.  I don't believe in the big story that they have fed us.  That's all.  Did the media have to film him just hugging his daughter?  I mean, can you give the guy a few minutes to grieve?  Although he does seem to be comfortable talking.  Oh, dude, the media.  Although he really is talking.  The media lives for this stuff.  I don't see one tear rolling down this guy's face. 
[01:08:30]  He's probably a shock.  I'm sorry.  The media lives for this stuff.  He looks like, you know who he looks like?  He was with Ozzy, now he's with Metallica Raba.  True.  Oh, right on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He does look like him a little bit.  The new bass player, right?  That was cool.  Yeah.  All right.  So, Anthony, let's play this thing.  Well, by the way, this mudslide tragedy, we'll have some Arnold Schwarzenegger.  The governor, Arnold, visited the site yesterday.  Why don't we talk about that?  Well, we've got some audio.  And the Nazi thing, and our old pal Jason from nyconfidential.com has been found. 
[01:09:00]  They got him?  They busted him?  They got him?  Yeah, we'll get into a bunch of things.  But first, it's this emphysema call.  Yeah, let's see.  About miles.  I don't know if it works, but we'll take a listen.  Thank you for calling Marlboro customer service.  This is Stephanie.  How may I help you?  Hello?  How can I help you?  Who is this?  Stephanie?  Yes, sir.  I'm calling Marlboro to thank them for sending me a birthday card. 
[01:09:30]  I just got it in the mail.  You're quite welcome.  Was there anything else I can help you with?  Well, I just thought it was really nice of you guys to send that.  I've been smoking Marlboro for 40 years.  Well, we're glad that you were happy with it.  Is this a policy then?  Send most people a birthday card?  No, sir.  Those are sent out randomly.  Oh, they're sent out randomly?  Yes, sir.  I was wondering because my birthday isn't until next week. 
[01:10:00]  And you've already received it?  Yes.  Well, happy birthday.  Well, thank you very much.  Thank you for calling customer service.  You have a great day.  Can I get a free pack of cigarettes?  I'm still smoking these things through the hole in my neck.  No, sir.  We don't send out free product through the mail.  But you don't understand.  Ever since I got this oxygen tank, it's a bitch to get out and get my own cigarettes.  You guys got me addicted to these.  Thanks. 
[01:10:30]  Okay.  I understand that, sir.  But we don't send out free products through the mail.  Well, they gave me this 1-800 number and I thought I could get something for free.  No, sir.  For all the years I've been smoking these things.  Okay.  Unfortunately, sir, we're not sending out any free product.  Was there anything else I can help you with?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[01:11:00]  I was just trying to figure out what good this number is if I can't get any free product.  I've been smoking these for 50 years.  Okay, I understand that, sir, and as I stated, we don't send out free products through the mail.  Well, what do you do on this phone line, then?  We take care of the promotion where you save your miles.  You save your miles?  Your UPCs off of each individual package. 
[01:11:30]  Can I get one of those nifty leather jackets?  If you send in $195 and the 2,400 miles, you certainly can.  Let me tell you, Stephanie, I've got enough miles to fly to Pluto.  Well, you send that in plus $195 and we'll send you a jacket.  That sounds wonderful.  Anything else I can do for you today, sir?  Yeah, I've got one more thing. 
[01:12:00]  Do you think it would be possible?  Thank you for calling customer service.  Thank you, and have a nice day.  Cash up, niggas.  All my niggas in the pool now, right now.

[01:13:00]  Fast Freddy from Jamaica Station  Is wondering if that guy that  Family died in the mudslide  Went out to get ice cream  And it comes back  And his family is gone  Wondering if he was  Going out to get  Ben and Jerry's  Mudslide Madness  And Rocky Road  Wow  Oh  Jeez 
[01:13:30]  Did you notice what song was  Playing in the background  When we were talking about that?  Blame it on the rain  Oh  Whoops  Alright  Let's go to the phones  Really fast here  Say hi to Brian in Jersey  Hey Brian, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  My wife was listening to  Who Who this morning  Yeah  And not only he was talking about  How he just don't care  He started talking about  Fareed and his divorce  With his wife  And how that they've hired  Barber  And a whole team of attorneys 
[01:14:00]  Into their divorce proceedings  Well, Dominic Barber's  Getting a divorce too  He got one  Oh, you got one?  Yep  Oh  His divorce just went through  And he was seen at a club  Or restaurant the other night  With his new chick  And she was wearing  An engagement ring  This guy is a habitual  Groom  He loves getting married  Because he's such a fat slob  That I guess once he finds a chick 
[01:14:30]  He feels he has to marry them  To have them stay with him  And then the divorce is right around the corner  Because judging from any contact I've had with Dominic Barber  Living with him must be a real treat  Well, it gets more gooder  Because after I go downstairs and start getting ready  When I come back upstairs about 20 minutes later  He's talking about pretty much how they're trying to find a new replacement for you guys  And he still just don't care  And all of his listeners are calling and telling him basically 
[01:15:00]  You know, like they can't replace him and all this other stuff  And whoever they find won't be good enough  Yeah, of course not  So today  It's so unreplaceable  Yeah, so today  Instead of doing a clever, entertaining, funny show  He's just going to have his listeners kiss his ass all morning  The guy doesn't want to do radio anymore  He doesn't want to entertain his fans  How many weeks of not caring are we on?  Jesus  This is like the second or third week of not caring  And then he'll go back to blaming Bush  Why he can't do a show  You know  And then he'll take 20 to 30 minutes of phone calls 
[01:15:30]  Of listeners kissing his ass  I mean  Figure out the pattern, dude  He has nothing left in the tank  Yeah, he was great in his day  Of course  I'm not stupid  But the guy doesn't want to do radio anymore  So he's going to come up with all sorts of excuses  And reasons why he can't entertain his listeners anymore  Late 80s, early to mid 90s  On fire  No one beating him  He's done, dude  It's over  He knows it  He just can't believe the little doggy come 
[01:16:00]  But he doesn't realize it's over  So he'll collect all that money  And then it'll fade away  Great  I wish I could do that  I wish I had that contract  But the reality is  He's not going to do clever, entertaining, funny radio anymore  He just won't  It's too much work  You know  To do what we do  It's too much freaking work  When you have a young girlfriend  And you have all the money in the world  And you've got a house in the Hamptons  And you've got a stretch limo escalade 
[01:16:30]  You don't feel like actually coming in  And working on a radio show anymore  So you hide behind  You know, the FCC is out to get me  You hide behind Bush  You know, is making it impossible for you to do your job  You hide  You bitch about Fareed because he took you off a few stations  And you start a whole I don't care thing  That you could stretch out  You know, you have your listeners call in and kiss your ass  It's all stuff you hide behind  Because you just, quite frankly, don't want to do a show anymore  Phoning it in  It's called phoning it in 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, but he's also screening his calls and only letting certain people  Ah, dude, he's the biggest pussy in radio  Everyone knows it in the business  Everyone knows it  He never took us on  He takes on people that he knows he can beat  He knows that  You know, we let everyone through on this show  Sometimes it's a little ugly  Sometimes they go after us  And it's like, well, okay  But you know what?  At the end of the day, we do an honest radio show  You know, that guy screens his callers  You know, he shut down his message board  Because he couldn't handle the abuse from the O&A Army  He's a phony dude 
[01:17:30]  Everyone knows it  But he's also such a pussy  That he almost mentioned you this morning  He's like, yesterday was my birthday  And I was mentioned on the  And then he just stopped  Yeah, because he listens to us every day  He has XM satellite radio in his Escalade  Yeah  You know, he talks about how everyone listens to him every day  Guess what?  Here's something  Howard listens to a lot of radio  Where do you think he gets a lot of his ideas from?  There's a whole list of radio guys  That effing hate him  Because he stole bits from them 
[01:18:00]  From all over the country  When, you know  Because these guys aren't syndicated  I can give you a whole list of things that happened  Yeah  Well, there's still guys stealing from you, too  I don't care  Yeah  I just don't care  So all he does is complain  Instead of doing a radio show  Let Fareed put on Opie and Anthony  I don't care  Thanks, bro  Bye  I just don't care  Alright  The guy got the golden parachute of contracts  Half a billion dollars  I don't care 
[01:18:30]  Half a billion dollars  That's great  He gets  And  I just don't care  Once you sign that kind of deal  It doesn't matter what you do  You could just  Not only that  I think he's got Fridays off  Or something  Yeah, there you go  The show's gonna be Monday through Thursday  There's a guy that's gonna be motivated  To entertain his fans  It's just a matter of time  You'll see  I guarantee  You'll see  And anybody who wants to  You know  Write or phone in  And say that  You know  We're just jealous of that contract  You're so right 
[01:19:00]  Absolutely correct  Excellent point  Who wouldn't drool over that deal  Of course  Here's the deal  Hopefully it'll happen to us eventually  And we'll call it in  But we're not at that stage in our career  That's the difference  We still have to work our balls off  That's why we get up at 3.30  That's why we're here  Around 4.45  Working on our show  The old escalating  Pulling in at 5 to 6  Not at all, man  You know  We're emailing each other  All day long  Making phone calls  Trying to make this show better  On a daily basis  Because we still have a lot to prove  And we understand  We can't call it in 
[01:19:30]  You know  Good for him  He can call it in  But eventually  You know  The listeners are gonna  Find out that he's a fraud now  He's an absolute fraud  And has nothing left  In the tank  To offer his fans  Did a great job  All those years  Duh  I don't want to sound stupid  By making believe  He's not good at radio  But he's not as good  As he used to be  Nowhere's near  No  He's a phony too  He's a wimp  He's never taken us on  Because you know  He knows he can't beat us  I never listened to him 
[01:20:00]  Even in the 80's  My father listened to Imus  That's who I liked  Dude, Imus has  It's like an old man thing to say  But I always liked Imus  People will call me out on this  And I don't care  But it's the truth  Imus' show is more entertaining  Than Howard's right now  More entertaining than Howard's  Imus has surrounded himself  With some people  That give him some good stuff  On a daily basis  Yeah  Oh, without a doubt  I don't get to listen to Imus  I watched Imus every morning  When we were on hiatus  Made me laugh  Oh, his little  His crew 
[01:20:30]  I mean, Imus  Imus doesn't really  Give much anymore himself  But he was smart enough  To surround himself  With a bunch of  Talented radio people  You know  He's just a funny guy, man  He is a funny dude  He always made me laugh  And what I like is  You know  He's pretty honest  And you talk about a guy  That truly doesn't care  What you think  Yeah  He just doesn't care  And he'll tell you  He's got a good sense of humor  He knows, you know  When people are goofing on him  Because he's Imus  You know  You don't know him personally  Enough to have 
[01:21:00]  You're goofing on him  For him to take it personally  You know  It's the Imus character  And you goof on it  We goof on it  Here  But he's got no problem with that  He understands  Not like Howie  Running off to Mel  All crying  Just literally crying  To Mel Carmisen  To shut us up  That was a great point  In our careers  Where they're having fun  Doing some radio  You know  In New York City  And there he is  You know  Howard  So we goof on him  A little bit  Expecting 
[01:21:30]  You know  He'll turn around  And maybe radio battle  We were pretty new  Coming into the market  And everything  And it would have been  A good thing  You know  We didn't even do it for that  No we didn't  But that's what  It was just really funny  Right  It was funny to do  And if you're doing radio  In New York  You talk about the characters  That are here  In New York City  And he certainly  Is one of the bigger ones  And we found an angle  And we had fun with it  That's all it really was  I thought he would either  Talk about it  Or not talk about it  You know  Just ignore it  Or talk about it  But to have him run to Mel 
[01:22:00]  And have Mel call us  Into his office  And tell us  Not to speak about him  Oh that  Right there  Deflated the whole  Balloon  That whole Howard balloon  That had been built up  From years of  You know  Listening and stuff  It's like  Ah this guy  Is just another  Ass  Just another  Pussy  Who can't take it  Runs to the boss  Yelling  Who's taking his job  Way too seriously  The fact is  We do radio  This is a goof job  Yeah  This is a goof job 
[01:22:30]  You want to make fun of me  You can do it all day long  I really don't care  Because you know  This is a goof job  I thank God  Every day  That I could come in here  And just goof off  You know  What's this  I wanted to listen  To my grandmother talk  I'd call her  I saw her  In the supermarket  She was  She wanted out of there  So bad  It wasn't even funny  Who is she  She saw me  And ran the other way 
[01:23:00]  And I never had a problem  With her  What  Well good luck to her though  What  Yeah whatever  Yeah  I wish I could use  My publicity photo  From ten years ago too  Who is she kidding  I never heard that bit  But it sounds funny  Fast Freddy  I missed  Wilford Brimley's  Turkey stuffing instructions  That sounds like  It would be hysterical 
[01:23:30]  Wilford Brimley  All he's known for now  Is  I have diabetes  He does those commercials  Have your insulin  Shipped right to you  Guy hasn't done anything  In years  Except those  Check yourself regularly  Check your sale  Have it shipped to you regularly  Be ready for Bloomberg  To tax it  In about a year  Yikes  No doubt  Where's the  Okay  We're going to have to  Take a break  Because we've got to  Kind of catch up  Is Frank Caliendo  Calling back  Did he get scared  Because of our rant there  And he hung up  It looked like  No what happened was 
[01:24:00]  Frank was in between  Flights today  He was going to call us  During his layover  He had two flights  But apparently  His layover is too short  So we're going to  We just blew it  I saw him on hold  We'll do it tomorrow  No one wants to hear  About the hoo-hoo crab  I wanted Frank doing  His Al Pacino and stuff  We'll do it tomorrow  Oh man  We blew that one  Traveling all over  These comics  Where's he going?  I don't know  We can give him a plug  We're all over the nation  Maybe he's going to Zany's  Zany's and Vernon  You can see Frank Caliendo  He's on the show with me  We can't take a break 
[01:24:30]  Because this guy's been  On hold for an hour  Eric from Cali  I'm sorry  Hey that's alright man  I was sitting here  Playing  Grand Theft Auto  Big fan of you guys  Been listening for a long time  And I actually had some  Wanted to seek some  Sex advice from the  Sweet tits there  Oh what can I do for you?  Well I wanted to know  We're going to go up to Reno  This weekend and go bang  And I wanted to know  What was the best  The Viagra  The Cialis  Or the La Vita  Alright hold on  Before he answers that question 
[01:25:00]  Because you're going to Reno  To bang  What are you doing  Some gambling  With some buds  And getting some whores  Or what?  Yeah just  We're going to leave  Out the gambling  But yeah we're going  To go up and go to  The bunny ranch  And what not  Go to the bunny ranch  It's the best  Oh okay you're going  Right to a whorehouse  Oh yeah  Alright alright  I was hearing the confidence  In your voice  And I was wondering why  That's all  So alright you're going  To the whorehouses  In Nevada there  And Jimmy  What's the answer there?  Well I would think 
[01:25:30]  That Viagra  From what I've heard  Gives you the worst headache  And the most stuffed nose  Those things affect your head  I think Levitra  They're all decent for that  I think Cialis is the best though  Oh  Why is that?  The rigid one?  Because supposedly  It stays in your system  For like two or three days  Two  Do you want that?  No it's very unhealthy  Although if you think  When I was in Brazil  I was taking 100mg Viagras  And I couldn't breathe at all  Because you know  My sinuses stink to begin with 
[01:26:00]  And I'm in a third world country  Just having sex  And it was disgraceful  I was popping three a night  I couldn't finish  I thought it was because  The head of your dick  Was up against your nostrils  Damn  Yeah  It stuffs you up  Oh it makes your nose  Because I have bad signs  To be honest  But it really brutally  Messes up your nose  They all do  They just affect you  In some weird way  But they all work dude  They all work  You know  And if not  I carry around  A 1985  Macaulay Culkin photo 
[01:26:30]  If Viagra doesn't work  That certainly will  I've got a  I've got a blown up picture  Of a  Little  Uh oh  Uh oh  Oh boy  Oh boy  Eric  Uh oh  Uh oh  Uh oh  Uh oh  Eric you know  Whenever we take  Whenever we take  A caller  I've got to remember  To load this up  Maybe he has to go  For the enjoyment  Of everyone  What were you trying to say  Yeah  Oh god  The uh  Scott Peterson reference  Little Connor

[01:36:00]  That was  Remember?  Yeah  Poe knows how to wake people up like that  Because when you  You strap someone to a chair  To torture them  For interrogation  And they pass out  You have to know how to  Wake them back up again  To keep interrogating  That's why Poe knows how to  Wake people up like that  Very good  Wait  So here's some  Tippy Tom audio  As we go to break  This is for my body  And you think I'm sexy  Come on baby  Let me know  Lonely  You're damn right  Looking for the time of your life  Are you single?

[01:41:00]  This is a great thing I do. I might even plug in the club. I'm not this weekend, but I do this with all my live appearances.  I don't like to brag, but it's really funny.  Yeah.  Like one time, some guy in the audience is like, will you yell something out? And somebody else will you yell something?  I go, hey, this is not the Jerry Springer show.  Ha, ha, ha.  I'm telling you.  Oh, you're a hoot. Your shows.  Yeah, you guys, you're in for a lot of that this weekend. 
[01:41:30]  I'm going to have to see some of that stuff, some of that funny stuff.  Banter between you and the audience like that.  Who would want to miss that?  Mm, mm, mm.  It smells like Pop-Tart in here.  Pop-Tart, gee, that.  Kind of.  Did you get them toasted?  Yeah.  Or are they raw?  No, Eric toasts them perfectly.  Toasted perfectly, not burnt?  Oh, don't burn Opie's Pop-Tart.  He got really insulted.  I go, dude, I'm kind of hungry and could you just, you know, get me these Pop-Tarts? 
[01:42:00]  Because we really don't have time to do anything.  No, the breaks are much too short.  Well, we're doing afternoons, man.  We, holy crap.  That's why you hear us eating during the show.  There's no time to eat.  There's no time to do anything.  We used to break for like, I don't know, 12 minutes, 15 minutes at a time with the old show.  Swear to God.  You'd go get a lot done.  We'd pound beers and play foosball.  Smoking a hole in it.  Smoking, yeah, smoke a cigarette, drink a beer, and play a game of foosball in one commercial break.  Some people would have sex during the breaks. 
[01:42:30]  That's right.  Yes, maybe some.  You know what would be really funny is if someone was having sex over a toilet.  Not to put no crunches on, but the one in the back of the office, that stupid creep used to hang out with his rubber gloves.  Just imagine someone having sex in that toilet.  Oh, that was hot.  Someone associated with the show bent a girl over a toilet once and had sex during the commercial break.  And then here's his name going, where is so-and-so, whatever his name may be.  Where is so-and-so Norton?  Yeah.  And then as he runs in wiping his mule off because he did it unprotected as usual. 
[01:43:00]  As usual.  The best part of that story, though, right after the show, driving.  I was in the car because we were going to dinner, driving to the Port Authority or whatever.  So she could go back to Buffalo.  Buffalo?  Yeah.  I know you're changing the city to protect the innocent.  Oh, very good.  You're very smart.  And the gender.  And throws her back on a bus.  Yeah. 
[01:43:30]  But not before I stopped for a few minutes.  Not one of those express buses either.  It was one of these buses that stops in every small town between here and, wink, wink, Buffalo.  Buffalo.  I did stop for a few minutes, I think.  Was it traffic the reason I pulled over?  I don't remember.  I did see you get ahead, yes.  Oh, my goodness.  I hope to watch someone get the mule drank out of for a few minutes.  No, I wasn't watching.  On the way to the bus station.  Yeah.  You are a despicable human.  Right in the middle of Times Square, I stopped at a light.  She's doing her thing.  I'm kind of going, ugh. 
[01:44:00]  And I'm in the back seat.  And then Norton is just, like, pointing, like, check the film.  Don't look.  Don't look.  So you've got to look.  Of course you do.  I'm thinking you've got to look.  So I look.  I'm like, Jesus Christ.  That's not queer.  That's not queer to do.  Full rod in the middle of Times Square.  I'm like, you're just a treat.  That's great.  Oh, she loved it.  She loved doing that.  Wow.  It wasn't like we had a threesome.  He just looked for a couple minutes.  And that was it.  I didn't even.  Hold on.  All right.  I didn't look for a couple of minutes.  You did.  I pulled over.  Shut up.  No, you didn't.  He actually leaned over and pulled my shirt back off my stomach, and he goes, let me see 
[01:44:30]  that thing.  Stop.  Don't make it worse than it is.  I took a peek.  Took a little peek.  Have you ever seen the times I've watched Voss over the years?  Big deal.  He's a team player.  He's always like, can you take care of my friend?  I remember one time he was getting treats in the car, and I'm in the back seat, and I  just, just whacked my bag before I went down to the cellar.  So I'm trying to do it again to turn the girl on, so she'll, you know, also give me  treats.  Right.  But it was just awful. 
[01:45:00]  It was embarrassing, like a wilted flower.  Oh.  All sore.  Uncomfortable.  And she wouldn't, uh...  No, would you have?  It was awful.  Would I have?  No, you know what I'm saying.  If you were a chick, would you?  Right.  Big stomach.  Unfunctional equipment.  Zilch.  All right.  I'm almost done with the Pop-Tart.  Sean in Jersey.  What's up, Sean?  Hey, boys.  Good morning.  How's my surly truck driver today?  What's that?  How's my surly truck driver?  Oh, very good.  A surly truck driver.  Nicely done.  Let me do my catchphrase.  You stink and I don't like you.  Welcome to the program.  That's Oscar for material right there. 
[01:45:30]  Listen, Prince Harry of the royal family in England dressed up as a Nazi at a costume  party recently.  Yeah, I saw that in the paper.  Well, you know, we talk about this every day.  All the New York papers, very important to show Prince Harry in his Nazi uniform, because  that's the most important news story of the day.  There was a costume party, I guess, over there in jelly old England.  And he went dressed as a Nazi.  And a lot of people were upset with that, said it was tasteless. 
[01:46:00]  But it just goes to show you, these two, not so much the older brother there, William,  I guess.  He's responsible, I think.  The other one.  But this Harry, he's some trouble, I guess, over there.  And he's always getting hammered.  He had a fight at some other event recently.  And now, how do you leave the palace?  How do you allow your son to leave the palace dressed as a Nazi?  It just shows there's no supervision.  Because if anyone saw this kid walking out of the place in Nazi regalia, I mean, you'd 
[01:46:30]  have to say, oh, brother, why don't you come back over here?  The guy is a mess.  I mean, he's getting caught, I think he has already been in rehab, he's drinking and drugging.  I mean, your whole life means nothing.  That kid's life means nothing unless his older brother dies.  That's it.  What is he, third in line for the throne or something?  Yeah, because they still got to wait for the old broad to die.  Oh, wait, wait, he's not in line, Eric.  He's not in direct succession.  Why is that?  What are you talking about?  He's not directly in the line to be king. 
[01:47:00]  He's second.  He only gets it if the whole family goes out.  He's not in the direct bloodline to be king.  How is he not in the direct bloodline?  Because it goes Charles, it goes William, and then William's son is the next one in line  to be king, not Harry.  Yeah, but William doesn't have a son.  That's what I'm saying.  So if Charles and Harry die, and William...  If the whole family has to go before he becomes king.  Wait, how is that?  What if just Charles and William dies?  Then it's Harry.  Then it's Harry.  There's something. 
[01:47:30]  Shut up.  No, there's something where he doesn't get it.  What is a something?  He's right, though.  It doesn't go brother.  The fact that you actually know that.  The fact that you're probably reading the son and all these...  But the reality is, the father's still waiting and waiting and waiting.  Yeah.  And then it's going to be the older son, and then I think, you know, then it's Harry.  So his life is pretty much meaningless.  Yeah, it's nothing.  And he knows it, and he's just partying.  And having a good time.  It's what you should do.  They are really forgiving over there, though. 
[01:48:00]  There's all kinds of these royal British Jewish organizations that are like,  well, as long as he's apologized, everything's okay.  They don't seem to care.  Like, over here, forget about it.  They'd be hanging him out to dry, everything.  But they just seem to blow it off like, oh, he admitted it was a mistake, which is odd.  How is that a mistake?  I didn't know it was a Nazi uniform?  I think they're saying that the fact that it was in such poor taste, even under that context, was the error. 
[01:48:30]  He realizes it was a mistake.  Like, that was a dumb thing.  I shouldn't have done it.  He's wearing a red and black swastika armband and an army shirt.  Looked like an army desert shirt.  Why can't you go to parties anymore dressed like a Nazi soldier?  Why can't you go to work dressed like that?  Jesus.  I mean, I'm playing devil's advocate.  Right.  Of course you are.  It just seems like something that would, it does make a damn good costume.  I've got to say that.  It does get attention.  It is an attention getter. 
[01:49:00]  And, you know, no matter what atrocities and horrors the Nazis committed back then,  you've got to give them, they were the snappiest goddamn dressers of any war ever.  Very true.  There's nothing better than watching one of those movies and they've got the nice, tall,  shined-up jack boots, those long leather coats, all the insignias and everything.  Very snappy dressers, the Nazis.  It's a shame they ruined that whole look.  Can't go to a party dressed as a Nazi anymore.  You could go as an American soldier. 
[01:49:30]  Can't even wear the mustache anymore.  Yeah, Hitler ruined the whole mustache look, that short little mustache.  You know, hey, Charlie Chaplin had the same one.  But if you wear that to work, you're pretty much getting your walking papers, I think,  if you're coming with a Hitler mustache.  And it's not even just the Jews.  It's like, look what the Nazis did to England.  I mean, they brutalized England.  I mean, they bombed the hell out of it.  Oh, my God.  Incendiary bombed of London.  And this kid just decided it was a good idea. 
[01:50:00]  Somebody in the military said that he shouldn't be allowed to join the Royal, whatever it is that the Royal Air Force.  I want them to relax.  All right, let's go to Frank in Jersey.  Frank, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Come on, guys.  You know you love the Nazis, man.  Don't try to get politically correct.  These guys are the greatest guys on earth.  Do me a fair play.  Camp concentration.  That song really says it all.  You sound like a staged guy.  Hey, you guys know.  Do me a favor.  He's doing shtick. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, well, I don't even know.  You're joking, right?  No, listen.  Come on.  He wants to base it.  You know better than anything.  You're just trying to be nice.  The Nazis were great.  Frank, Frank, Frank.  Come on.  Stop trying to get a reaction.  Yeah, Frank, it's not working, and you don't even believe that, so let's relax.  All you had to say was, can you play camp concentration, because it goes along with what you're talking about right now.  Yeah.  That's all you need to do.  And honestly, I don't even think.  Do we even have a copy of camp concentration?  But you guys know.  You guys know you like the Nazis. 
[01:51:00]  Shut up.  We're not being polite.  Look, I despise political correctness as much as anything, but it's amazing how people misinterpret anything you do.  Oh, I know.  As political.  Like with the whole church day, they'll go, why are they being politically correct about it?  It's like, I didn't agree with Infinity's reaction, but that wasn't exactly political correctness.  Right.  Exactly.  You've got to know when political correctness is the problem.  Yes.  Nathan in PA.  What's up, Nathan?  Not much.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi, Nathan.  Love your hot dogs.  That's terrific. 
[01:51:30]  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Oh, my stars.  I'm incorrigible.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Nathan.  Harry should have went over to France.  They would have given him the whole fucking country to run.  Anti-Semitic, hairy, sneaky people.  The whole army throwing down their weapons as he walks to his costume party.  Jeff, also from Jersey.  Got to acknowledge Jersey, man.  They decided to get their XM satellite radios big time.  Even our home area, Long Island, doesn't have as many listeners as Jersey. 
[01:52:00]  Jersey's great.  Let's go, Jeff.  Yeah.  Fox News, they just said that the royal family's supposed to be responsible for holding a Holocaust  memorial next month.  Yeah.  You know the, I don't know, I don't think they're very sensitive, the English royal family to  the Holocaust or anything like that.  I think it's one of those.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's say hi to Joe in Bridgeport.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hi, Joe.  Hey, shit, Vic. 
[01:52:30]  Thanks for calling.  Watch that language.  Listen, Prince Charles cannot become a king.  No?  He will never become a king because he divorced the corpse.  Oh, the lady die, the other one?  Yes.  So his son is the next in line.  Are you serious?  I didn't know that.  No, no, no.  Yeah, as soon as that old bag dies.  I don't think so, dude.  No, you're talking out of your ass, bro.  No.  Prince Charles is definitely next in line.  We know about much, right?  Yeah.  So if the queen dies, then Prince Charles dies, and all right, then it would, wait, what 
[01:53:00]  is this guy saying?  Tad from San Francisco.  If the queen, Prince Charles, and Prince William were to die, it would go to Charles'  brother first, then to Harry.  Oh, wow.  Charles' brother first?  Take a right turn?  Charles has a brother?  Who is that?  Prince Charles has a brother?  Oh, maybe he's...  Is it Andrew?  If that doesn't prove that Harry's life is useless...  Wow.  No, no, maybe because he's a direct descendant, and then William's the direct, but if William 
[01:53:30]  was to die, the next closest thing to a direct would be right from the queen.  Yeah, no, I understand that, but I...  But he has a...  Prince Charles has a brother?  Two of them, I think.  Prince Andrew?  Prince Andrew.  Oh, those guys.  Oh, all right.  If only one of them would be eligible.  Wow.  That's rough.  Stupid stupid ass.  So, yeah, Harry just is dressing up in Nazi uniforms and going to parties, because it  just doesn't matter for him.  You know what I like about Harry, though?  He has a very, very sweet face.  You guys?  Yeah. 
[01:54:00]  Keep calm.  Uh-huh.  We have a girl calling the show.  Ooh!  Girl!  It's a girl.  I like girls.  Hmm.  Girls smell nice.  Amy!  Most do.  Yes.  How are you today?  In the ethnicity, of course.  I'm doing great.  How are you guys?  Good.  What's going on today?  I was just going to let you guys know that I absolutely love you guys.  Thank you!  Where are you, Amy?  I'm in D.C.  Oh, hi.  D.C.  Are you listening to Zoll?  Um, no. 
[01:54:30]  What the hell, Zoll?  Zoll?  Isn't that the new station?  The new Spanish station?  Oh, that's...  Oh, you know what it is.  Yeah, WHFS went off the air yesterday.  HFS is a legendary radio station.  Legendary in D.C.  In the D.C. area.  Matter of fact, the fine folks at HFS have been trying to hire us for many, many years  to go do mornings down there.  And, uh, I don't know.  We were too busy doing other stuff, I guess.  I see.  And, uh, yeah, they just flipped formats to what?  Spanish dance?  Spanish.  Yeah, it's really crap.  Picture, you know, a huge rock station in your city just turning Spanish overnight. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, it was a rock station?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's like, uh...  Legendary.  They did the HF Festival every year.  Right.  Where it was like one of those big rock station concerts that they put on.  It was huge every year.  Yeah, like the River Raid they do in Boston, and, uh, and K-Rock does their, uh, whatever  it's called.  Dysfunctional Family Picnic.  Or whatever, yeah.  It's their big trademark, uh, benchmark event that they do.  Very, very respect the, uh, uh, yeah, whatever.  Uh, so, well, thank you, Amy. 
[01:55:30]  You're very welcome.  Yep.  A lot of people are wondering.  Yeah, that's what they're saying in New York City.  They're wondering if our old radio station, WNW, which is a complete disaster.  You know the one that Frankie Blue just got fired from?  Right, and, uh, has just failed miserably ever since we got the can.  Hey, get me on the air, man.  Hey, hola, it's Frankie Blue here.  I'm drinking tequila as we go to Spanish music.  Hey, remember, you can win a Taco Bell Grande from Taco Bell, and then we're gonna go out and 
[01:56:00]  fuck our listeners with...  What's the Spanish word for fuck?  It'd be much funnier.  El Funko, El Listener-o.  El-ba-o.  Remember, tune in, mutt, yana.  What a tool.  Yeah, so Earl is still working over at NW.  Earl is Black Earl.  He's been at WNW, this legendary rock station here in New York, uh, for, uh, close to 20 
[01:56:30]  years, I think.  Oh, yeah.  He worked with the legendary Scott Muni, he worked with us, and he fell, he just refuses  to give up on, on, uh, WNW and its, and its heritage.  Even though they're now playing dance music, Earl is convinced someday it's gonna go back  to this legendary rock station, and he doesn't want to give up on the place.  Yeah.  And now there's rumors that...  Classic rock, classic jazz.  Alright, now there's rumors that our old station, that Earl is still working at, is, uh, gonna  do this Spanish dance thing.  Well, you know something?  In the bigger cities, there's a huge Spanish audience. 
[01:57:00]  Uh, if you have a station that isn't working, low-rated, uh, people are starting to talk about  this, and since this was an infinity station that flipped, and WNW is infinity, this might  be something that, you know, they're gonna try out, and, uh, you know, if NW, like you  said, legendary rock station, flips to Spanish, Earl said he's gonna quit, he'll be the first  one coming in with a sombrero on, hey, I'm here, maracas in hand, driving to Castanet stops, 
[01:57:30]  getting lost, he's not quitting.  What would happen to his dream of, uh, producing the Black Rock Coalition?  Could I put a Black Rock Coalition show on, even though it's a Spanish station?  It'd have to be the Rock Coalition Negro.  Oh, el negro, roco.  That's how you say black in Spanish, right?  N-E-G-R-O.  I don't know.  Is it?  And I like the fact that Ben wrote down sombrero, and the producer of this show spelled it S-U-M-B-R-E-R-O. 
[01:58:00]  Sombrero.  I'm writing it fast.  How fast are you writing it?  Who cares?  I'm going to be spelling it phonetically.  What do you call a, uh, black DJ, by the way?  Oh, jeez, are you skirting?  What?  What?  Uh...  Well, now I'm not going to tell you.  DJ.  DJ?  Why is everyone...  I'm not telling you now.  It's not the classic old joke?  Wait.  What joke?  A dumb j...  No, wait, uh...  What joke?  No, I...  When I say that, I just...  I can't figure it out.  What do you call a black DJ? 
[01:58:30]  Because there's the other ones, you know, that whole gag, I just...  Well...  NJ?  What?  No.  I'm not telling you now.  Forget it.  Opie!  No.  Just like everyone else, a disc jockey.  Exactly.  Yeah.  There you go.  Oh, I see.  Let's please steer the ship away from there.  An LJ.  What are you talking about?  I wasn't going there.  Forget it now.  Of course not.  You know comedy's all about timing now, I can't tell you what.  You can tell us, because the suspense is good, you've paused. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, we know the Spanish word for fuck.  That's what's great about satellite radio.  Hector, what's up?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hi, Hector.  Hola.  Yeah, check it out.  The Spanish words, there's several Spanish words for fucking, man.  You got chingan.  Right.  Chichan.  What's the difference between the different F words?  Well, it depends upon what Spanish country you're from.  Oh, okay, okay. 
[01:59:30]  You know, there's a whole bunch of them.  In the Dominican Republic, they said, dale leÃ±a.  Uh-huh.  Dale leÃ±a.  A little Spanish lesson.  Give them wood.  Dame un beso.  That's give me a kiss.  I know.  I was kidding.  No, you weren't.  Yeah, I learned a Spanish girl I dated taught me that years ago.  All right.  Tell me one thing, guys.  Yeah.  What the heck is a Java log?  A Java log? 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  It's a log that you would purchase at any store, like a Duraflame log, only it gives out a smell of freshly brewing coffee.  It's a very, very common item in the homosexual community.  Shut the F off.  Normally brought to the hospital by one friend for a sick friend.  Have your fun.  A lot of times, men in robes will give each other, like, scented baths.  Have your fun.  They're very light, so if you're sickly, you can carry them to the fireplace without breaking a frail little bone. 
[02:00:30]  Well, I'm sorry to ask.  Have your fun.  No, you put it in the fireplace, and it actually, it's got a bleachy scent.  Have your fun.  And as you burn them, the great payoff is that as you burn them, minutes later, buff firemen show up at your door.  Enjoy.  Okay.  But when it's a Java log fire, they show up not wearing their jackets, but just their suspenders over their taut abs.  Have your fun. 
[02:01:00]  And their pants have Velcro running down the legs.  And as the music starts, they can tear it off.  Start dancing.  Have your fun.  And the Java log also has a helmet shape at one end.  Have your fun.  All right.  And the other question.  You don't need matches to start it.  You just grab a hole and jerk it quickly.  Because that's exactly what happened.  Have your fun.  Yeah, when you burn it, the smoke only comes out a little hole in the tip.  Right.  And to put it out, you don't need water.  You just put your mouth over it. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, because that's exactly what happened.  What was your next question, Hector?  I'm almost afraid to ask.  No, I'm sorry.  Monster Rain.  Oh, Monster Rain.  Monster Rain is actually the beginning of what eventually leads to Java log purchases.  You know, I think that people at whackbag.com and opianthony.net, I always mess up their URL.  They get pissed off at me.  Another great message board, opianthony.net.  They're running some kind of a contest, a raffle for XM stuff or whatever, opianthony.net for details. 
[02:02:00]  But maybe those two websites can help out the new fans and explain some of these storylines.  Because we don't have time to keep explaining Monster Rain and the Java log and all that crap.  We don't have time for that crap.  That's right.  Don't forget, cringehumor.net.  I've got to throw that.  Cringehumor.net is a great, great site.  All these links are up on opianthony.com, by the way.  I think wowfans.com is pretty good.  You got it.  All right.  Thank you, Hector.  Thank you.  And I didn't hear you. 
[02:02:30]  What's that, Hector?  I didn't hear you.  I'm sorry, but I didn't hear you.  I said singape.  What's that mean?  Go fuck yourself.  Nice.  What type of language is that?  I happen to have my young producer in the car.  And isn't it impossible to actually F yourself?  Yeah.  Depends on who you are.  Can you actually F yourself?  F yourself, perhaps.  Maybe.  No, I think only guys can F themselves.  How does a girl F herself?  With a device.  Yeah.  Or her hand.  She falls in love with me.  That'll do it. 
[02:03:00]  You nailed him so bad.  It was the intern that was walking out, and you said, dude, dude.  The eagerness that he reopened the door and turned around with was stunning.  It was a perfect gag.  You got him so badly.  Me?  Me?  He really was like Charlie Chesnick.  What?  He needs me?  Charlie Chesnick.  Me?  Me?  That was great.  Are you going to say goodbye to me, Mac?  Settle down, Charles. 
[02:03:30]  All right.  You know, we have so much to do that we're getting to nothing at this point.  So let's take a break.  This will make sense here, and we'll continue.  Perhaps one of the most interesting words in the English language today is the word fuck.  Out of all of the English words that begin with the letter F, fuck is the only word that is referred to as the F word.  It's the one magical word. 
[02:04:00]  Just by its sound can describe pain, pleasure, hate, and love.  Fuck, as most words in the English language, is derived from German, the word fricken, which means to strike.  In English, fuck falls into many grammatical categories.  As a transitive verb, for instance, John fucked Shirley.  As an intransitive verb, Shirley fucks.  Its meaning's not always sexual.  It can be used as an adjective, such as, John's doing all the fucking work. 
[02:04:30]  As part of an adverb, Shirley talks too fucking much.  As an adverb, enhancing an adjective, Shirley is fucking beautiful.  As a noun, I don't give a fuck.  As part of a word, abso-fucking-lutely, or in-fucking-credible.  And as almost every word in a sentence, fuck the fucking fuckers.  As you must realize, there aren't too many words with the versatility of fuck. 
[02:05:00]  As in these examples, describing situations such as, fraud, I got fucked at the used car lot.  Dismay, aw, fuck it.  Trouble, I guess I'm really fucked now.  Aggression, don't fuck with me, buddy.  Difficulty, I don't understand this fucking question.  Inquiry, who the fuck was that?  Dissatisfaction, I don't like what the fuck is going on here.  Incompetence, he's a fuck-off. 
[02:05:30]  Dismissal, why don't you go outside and play hide and go fuck yourself?  I'm sure you can think of many more examples.  With all of these multi-purpose applications, how can anyone be offended when you use the word?  We say, use this unique, flexible word more often in your daily speech.  It will identify the quality of your character immediately.  Say it loudly and proudly. 
[02:06:00]  Fuck you.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony.  Ooh, it's in my shoes.  Ramon, clean this up.  Tempter Town, the Opie and Anthony show.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program. 
[02:06:30]  The O and A virus spreading across America.  It certainly is.  Thanks for the help, guys.  We appreciate it.  You guys have been adding a lot to the show lately, making our jobs a lot easier.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And this show is a work in progress.  Remember yesterday we were talking about Lost in Space? 
[02:07:00]  Oh, dear.  And Dr. Smith being a pedophile?  You will be molested.  Where's the other one where it sounds like he's having sex?  Oh, this one.  And then we played the Lost in Space Clips.  It was very funny.  Giving examples of him being pretty creepy. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  And then someone brought up Family Guy, how they acknowledged that they thought that Dr. Smith was also a pedophile.  Yes.  Well, we found a clip from Family Guy.  It's very funny, actually.  Just a quickie here.  And then Steve just ran in here with the Flintstones cigarette spot that we were taking on earlier.  About the cartoons.  So, like I said, these things are a work in progress always.  Always wrapping up little storylines every day, right?  So this is Family Guy. 
[02:08:00]  Talking about Lost in Space.  We need to gather more information about this new planet.  Don, you take my 16-year-old blonde daughter out in the chariot for the rest of the day.  Penny, you stay here with me.  And Will, you and the robot go out into the uncharted wilderness and take this mincing, boy-hungry pedophile with you.  You will be molested.  Ah, yes.  God damn.  Rest in peace, Dr. Smith.  Rest in peace.  Yeah, someone might pay attention to the fact that Major West and Judy were an item if it wasn't for the over-the-top pedophilia that was going on with Dr. Smith and Will. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  You know, because you look, and it was John Robinson's daughter, Judy, and she's with the guy.  How awkward is that?  And she was a lot younger.  Yeah.  You know, the blonde bombshell kind of thing she had going.  You think he might have been just like a sugar daddy?  Maybe a sugar daddy.  Oh, boy. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, because he's kind of, you know, older than her.  He's a little older than her.  Derek is quick in the other room.  Holy S, what's wrong with you?  Perhaps, uh...  Are we in a time warp?  How did he know there was even a song called Sugar Daddy?  I don't know.  Sugar Daddy.  That is creepy.  Wow, that's really good.  Are we on some kind of weird delay that I don't know about?  We found something you do well.  Yeah.  Were you just waiting for us to say the word sugar daddy?  All three hundred, sugar daddy. 
[02:09:30]  You made it.  Remember, Derek, it's just a bad song.  Wow.  Do you think Mrs. Robinson was upset with the fact that Don West was seeing Judy?  I'd imagine that a parent wouldn't be happy that their young daughter is seeing an older guy.  Was that any of the mother?  And may just think, hey, it's a sugar daddy type of thing.  But even though maybe Major West's intentions were different, not that of a sugar daddy,  of somebody who actually cared for this younger woman.  Yeah, maybe the intentions were pure and genuine. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, but Mrs. Robinson wouldn't see it that way.  She'd be butting in and kind of giving her opinions, even though they're not needed or asked for.  And what does age mean anyway?  Right.  If you fall in love, you fall in love, right?  Yeah, sure.  Yeah.  You're into a chick like Judy and Major West.  What does it matter if Major West is a little older, right?  Why would Major West even have to deal with Mrs. Robinson?  I don't know.  He's got stuff to do. 
[02:10:30]  He's treating her nice, it seems.  I'm sure Major West understands the age difference.  Right.  But he can't help it.  He can't change that about himself.  He's into the hot blonde bombshell.  And John Robinson isn't getting involved in this whole thing?  I don't know.  No?  Maybe Mrs. Robinson is unhappy with certain things and she felt it was more appropriate to take it out on Major West.  Maybe.  I think Mrs. Robinson, a little too overprotective of Judy, who is old enough to make her own decisions.  Right.  Would you agree with that, Opie? 
[02:11:00]  It sounds like, yeah, sure.  Then again, maybe Mrs. Robinson is concerned because Major West has a reprehensible reputation that could possibly be it.  But perhaps that's just the part that a lot of the people see.  But then, you know, a lot of the people meaning the entire country and the news media.  Right.  Yeah, maybe.  Major West doesn't truly enjoy having quiet nights with Java logs. 
[02:11:30]  No.  No.  No, Major West is never, you know, hanging out with the, I don't know, Dr. Smith.  Of course not.  With a Java log burning.  And a wine bottle.  No.  Watching a...  Could be fun to joke about that on the spaceship.  But the reality is he's into, you know, the hot blonde bomb show.  So how should Major West deal with Mrs. Robinson being upset with the relationship with Judy?  I know.  Maybe Major West should bring his fat-breasted other male friend and say, look, Miss Robinson, at least she's not with him. 
[02:12:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  That's a good idea.  I don't know.  This storyline will take a while.  Trust me, kids.  Don't even attempt to figure it out.  Sounds like being lost in space isn't their only problem there, huh?  Sounds like some little things going on.  Oh, well.  Have fun. 
[02:12:30]  I'm sure Major West would have drove her home.  Well, where was the, you know, that little ship?  But you can't drive someone home in an imaginary car or spaceship.  No, no.  You don't keep a spaceship handy.  Like that, it's not viable to have another spaceship with the Jupiter 2.  Right.  For long trips or anything.  If the spaceship was in the area, I'm sure he would have had no problem driving her back home.  Right. 
[02:13:00]  But Mrs. Robinson sees this maybe as not caring about Judy.  Right.  Instead of just plain logistics.  Plain logistics, that there just wasn't a spaceship available.  Right.  Exactly.  Mrs. Robinson's just being concerned.  And that another means of transportation made more sense.  Sounds a little more to me than just Mrs. Robinson being concerned for Judy's safety and well-being.  Possible.  Major West is a professional guy.  Seems nice enough.  Seems like he's treating Judy fine.  Yes.  I don't see what her problem is. 
[02:13:30]  Well, the perception of Major West may not be as people who know Major West and know that he's an oddball but basically a harmless, nice guy.  Yeah.  Most people might not see that.  A lot of people see Major West and just see this persona.  And maybe it takes a while to get to know Major West.  And he doesn't look his age or act his age.  Right.  He doesn't.  Right.  Maybe Mrs. Robinson should see this part of Major West.  But it doesn't seem to me like, from what I've heard anyway, that she's into this. 
[02:14:00]  Well, she's never seen Major West hanging out by a skateboard stand.  All right.  Or doing other things that teenage space boys do.  Teenage space boys.  Oh, brother.  Well, give that one time, kids.  Good luck with that one, Major West.  Yeah, good luck.  Good luck, Major West.  Because we'll see how that plays out for you.  That is some crap you shouldn't have to deal with when you're out of your 20s.  Poor Major West. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  Poor Major West, man.  Finds himself a Judy that he likes and has to deal with Mrs. Robinson.  Although, might I say that Major West's fat-breasted friend had a similar situation when he was 28, and he met somebody of 18, and her space parents were not happy.  We've all been through those situations.  Yes.  You know?  Because, you know, Major West goes for Judy.  There's got to be some concern, not just with John Robinson and Mrs. Robinson, but with some other crew members, maybe. 
[02:15:00]  Other people that are just observing, casual observers might see this as something that it really isn't.  Right.  They might see Major West as a sugar daddy.  A sugar daddy.  Sugar daddy.  I want him fired.  You know.  But on the outside, you know, the only time, the longer they're lost in space and hanging out, taking care of the hydroponic garden, maybe maintaining the chariot so they could go on little expeditions together, 
[02:15:30]  and the longer they do this together, the more the casual observer and the rest of the crew sees that it is just not a sugar daddy chippy thing,  that it perhaps is something a little deeper, more meaningful, and longer lasting.  There's a Purina cat chow ad, and the cat was walking up to the bowl of food, and it said Chester on the side of the bowl. 
[02:16:00]  Stop it.  I swear to God.  No wonder you threw your shoe at the television.  I did not.  Trying to hit that little cat's television liver.  Oh, one final thing, because it has been confused.  A little doggy O.J. Simpson sitting over there.  One other thing, because it has been confused for whatever reason.  Yeah.  Major West is not married.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  People think Major West is married?  Yeah.  Everyone knows Major West is single. 
[02:16:30]  He's not married.  Major West isn't married.  Doesn't really have any deep, dark secrets.  He's not married.  Major West may have, at some point, had some relationship on Earth, but that was a while ago,  and then on the Jupiter 2, since he's been on the Jupiter 2 with Judy, what?  There's been nobody else.  Nobody else.  There's no wife.  There's no wife.  Wow.  If only Mrs. Robinson knew how, when Major West hangs out with his fat-breasted friend, 
[02:17:00]  he doesn't do anything.  He doesn't try to get laid at all.  So the fat-breasted friend is left alone while Major West responsibly goes back to his hotel  room and mellows out and goes to bed in a piece an hour.  And then the fat-breasted friend, hoping to play on the star factor, Major West is left  to his own devices on the Internet.  All right.  Well, here, to everyone on the message board, on the instant feedback. 
[02:17:30]  What is that being brought in?  There's a long box.  Those are our new shades for the windows and the doors.  Oh, cool.  Oh, I think they're sunglasses.  All right.  Well, Anthony, we have the Flintstones cigarette ad.  No, some people are very confused.  Of course.  Some people are very confused.  And they're supposed to be confused.  People, my ship landed a long time ago.  I'm back on Earth.  Resting safely, soundly, and fine.  Don't worry about me.  I am not on the Jupiter 2.  I am back at base. 
[02:18:00]  Have been for many years.  And I have no problem with any of the crew or any casual observers or anything.  It is not me that is battling to get back to Earth, lost in space, trying to navigate  the Jupiter 2, having to deal with Mrs. Robinson.  And I believe the next rocket ship to take off will be the Martini Steve.  Oh, Jesus.  Jupiter 2.  That's right.  The first guy to get a drunk driving ticket actually in the atmosphere. 
[02:18:30]  Steve.  You're weaving all over the place.  Take your sweet face and steer this thing, you big bear of a man.  Oh, dear.  Oh, lost in Chelsea.  Oh, sorry.  Let's be honest.  Steve would enjoy a java log a lot more than I.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Let's all calm that down.  Steve, what are you trying to say?  Against his cheek.  Steve is the most hetero guy ever around. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, really?  The signs are all there.  He enjoys the flaming clothing.  That's right.  He enjoys the bear look.  He enjoys the tats.  All right.  I've seen him, you know, I've seen him like everybody else, enjoy looking at an attractive  woman.  Mm-hmm.  Sure.  I don't understand where this comes from.  I was dating this girl years ago, and I used to say things to girls that gross them out.  I used to always ask her, like, what would you do if you came downstairs one time, and  me and your dad were sitting on the couch, whacking each other's backs? 
[02:19:30]  You say this to girls?  Just to annoy her.  Yeah, this one girl, and she would go, that's so disgusting.  And I would say, and just as your dad was about to finish, he put his face in my neck  and went, ugh.  Oh, my God.  And she said that was such a graphic.  It was so disturbing to her.  And you wonder why.  You know, so that's very funny.  I always talk about sexually assaulting the relatives or whatever girl I'm dating.  That is really funny.  We had this sound man when our band used to travel around. 
[02:20:00]  Our sound man was this gay guy.  We used to call him Mr. Zenon, who was some company he worked for.  And whenever we'd get together without him in the bus or anything, we'd talk about what  it must be like with him having his gay sex.  Because you could just, because you get to know the guy so well, you get to really picture  all of his little idiosyncrasies, little facial movements and stuff.  So you could really picture it.  And we used to talk it up and just go like, oh, stop. 
[02:20:30]  And one was him laying on the bed, mewed with, like, on his stomach, with one leg kind of  bent, looking over his shoulder, going, biting the palm of his hand, going, oh, oh.  And it just made everyone on the bus go, oh, stop it.  Why is it so fun to gross people out like that?  You know what another one she hated was?  Because I knew her grandparents.  She used to hate when I talked about, like, what would happen if you walked in and I was 
[02:21:00]  dry humping your grandmother against the counter, but she had her pantyhose on that I just  liked to dress up.  And I was just holding her ass, just dry humping or grunting.  And girls would, what?  Oh, it was the same girl.  She would just, she would, because of the graphicness.  Dude, that is so funny that you do this to girls.  Always, always.  And she had a sense of humor about it?  She was, no, because I would do it.  No.  There would always be something.  She said the grossest part of the father thing was that I said as he was about to finish  that he would put his face in my neck and go, ugh. 
[02:21:30]  That was what sent her over the edge.  You are the sickest son of a bitch.  But there was always something so graphic in the description.  Right, right.  Very personal.  Yeah, that she could just completely visualize what I was saying.  God damn, you are twisted.  That's funny.  Really fast.  Oh, where was it?  It's not going to be fast now because I can't find it.  Ah, you hit refresh, didn't you?  And then you lost it.  Is that what happens?  Yeah, I do that too.  Sometimes you find a good instant feedback. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, okay.  Okay, Biscuit Eater Cassette from Savannah, Georgia.  Yeah.  Is Lady Di the cooler of the show?  Yesterday's show was killing until that train wreck called in, even though it made for good  radio yesterday.  But that's got to be her new name, the cooler.  The cooler?  Yeah.  We've got to get Kenny, Club Soda Kenny, if you're listening, you've got to come in and  say, here comes the cooler.  Oh, then we'll put that on tape, yeah.  Yeah, we've got to get that on tape.  Play that one.  She shines in.  Anthony, we've got the Flintstones talking about cigarettes.  Yeah.  We mentioned this earlier. 
[02:22:30]  A little earlier, the times they did a change.  They used to be able to have cigarette ads on television, and even cartoon characters,  which now, you can't have a cartoon character hawking anything now, or else they say you're  exploiting the children, harming the children.  But back in the old days, cigarettes.  What was this?  Winston, I think.  Winston.  Fred and Barney.  They sure work hard, don't they, Barney?  Yeah.  I hate to see them work so hard. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, me too.  And let's go around back where we can't see them.  Gee, we ought to do something, Fred.  Okay.  How's about taking a nap?  Hey, I got a better idea.  Let's take a Winston break.  That's it.  Winston is the one filter cigarette that delivers flavor 20 times a pack.  Winston's got that filter blend.  Yeah, Fred.  Filter blend makes the big taste difference, and only Winston has it up front where it counts. 
[02:23:30]  Here, ahead of the pure white filter, Winston packs rich tobacco specially selected and specially  processed for good flavor in filter smoking.  Yeah, Barney, Winston tastes good like a cigarette chute.  Oh, man.  Wow.  The Flintstones has been brought to you by Winston, America's best-selling, best-tasting filter cigarette.  Winston tastes good like a cigarette chute. 
[02:24:00]  Wilma, Wilma, I've got to get to the rock quarry.  They took my throat out.  I got throat cancer from Winston cigarettes.  Barney, Barney, could you pedal the car with your feet today?  I'm weak from the chemo.  That cartoon's hawking butts.  They show Betty in one episode having to fill one side of the bra with tissue, and she's 
[02:24:30]  smoked for a long time.  Oh, my God.  Are you insane?  I'm Betty.  Why I'm Betty?  Oh, we're going into the silly zone again.  All right.  Well, there you go.  The Flintstones talking about cigarettes.  That's a little strange.  The voices were a little off, though, right?  Yeah, it almost sounded like fake Fred.  Hey, Barney.  Yeah, it sounded like Jackie Gleason.  Hmm. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  Well, that cartoon was based on the Honeymoon.  Based on the Honeymoon.  Stolen from.  I hated the Flintstones.  Stolen?  Did you?  I loved it growing up.  Jetsons, too.  Hated it.  I hated the Jetsons.  Loved the Flintstones, though.  God.  I don't like Bugs Bunny because there was a viciousness to it.  Bugs was great.  Probably the best cartoons ever made were the old Warner Brothers cartoons.  But now they cut out all the violence when you see Bugs Bunny now.  All those cartoons were all about the violence.  It's all about smashing people on the heads with frying pans and shooting them in the face 
[02:25:30]  with shotguns.  And then they cut it to pieces now.  Now he's the bunny.  Hooray.  Smashing his face on the ground.  Oh.  I loved it.  I loved those cartoons.  Growing up, watched them all the time.  I can't believe you didn't like the whole nastiness.  Never liked them.  Bugs was just a nasty thing.  I liked Bugs Bunny.  Oh, you did?  No, I loved them.  I thought you said you didn't like Bugs Bunny.  No, I hate the Flintstones.  I liked Bugs Bunny.  I'm so confused.  No, no.  Bugs Bunny was great, man.  That's why that's the best cartoon. 
[02:26:00]  It is.  Uh-oh.  F-ing idiots.  Peter from Whackbag.com.  What cigarette did Opie smoke?  Chesterfields?  No, he kicked that habit.  Right in the liver.  A lot of rumors flying around.  Yeah.  As far as this show goes.  I don't know why.  What are you giving me, Eric?  People love Lost in Space.  Oh, okay.  I see.  All right.  Thank you.  What did you give Opie?  Just cartoon theme songs.  Oh, what is it? 
[02:26:30]  What are you drinking, Ben?  A little water?  Can we get more coffee?  I'm fading.  Get in, Terry.  Opie wants coffee.  Let's go.  Coffee.  Coffee.  All right.  Well, we have the Winston commercials, too.  You want to try a couple of these?  Yeah.  Let's hear some of these olden day commercials.  Oh, no.  This is for Newport.  Newport.  Yo, B.  I loves the Newport.  Hey! 
[02:27:00]  Groovy.  Just give me a coffee, please.  Newport tastes fresher.  Tastes better, too.  All right.  They're great.  Newport tastes fresher.  Tastes better, too.  This is just conjure up images of walking into the Copa.  Tastes better, too.  Smoking cigarettes and drinking.  Yeah.  Than any other Memphis cigarette.  Walking through the back of the Copa.  Walk through the back.  I think that's about it up front. 
[02:27:30]  I think that's about it.  It's just a jingle.  That one's boring.  Music's great, ain't it?  And then this one's for Lucky Strike.  Old cigarette ads.  Lucky Strike.  First again with Tobacco Men.  First again with Tobacco Men.  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  L-S-M-F-T. 
[02:28:00]  L-S-M-F-T.  Lucky Strike means fine tobacco.  Yes, in a cigarette, it's the tobacco that counts.  And Lucky Strike means fine tobacco.  Yes.  So round.  So firm.  So fully packed.  Yes.  So free and easy on the draw.  So for your own real deep down smoking enjoyment, smoke that smoke of fine tobacco, Lucky Strike. 
[02:28:30]  And remember, collards, use your own water fountain.  Don't these just all sound?  Yes, Lucky Strike.  Smoke them without Negroes around.  After you've run the fire hose on black people, enjoy the draw of a nice Lucky Strike. 
[02:29:00]  Yes, Lucky Cigarette.  To be enjoyed without the pain and agony of having black people around.  You could walk into a diner that doesn't serve Negroes and light up a Lucky Strike.  So after you go home and beat your wife, draw on a nice Lucky Strike.  You'll be lucky there are no Negroes in your neighborhood.  Because you're white and live in America.  And you're free not to live near black people. 
[02:29:30]  And smoke Lucky Strike cigarettes.  Ah, the good old days.  That's wonderful.  What do you call a black guy that's smoking a cigarette?  Um, um, so you laughed.  I wanted to tell you the answer there.  What was the answer?  I'm not saying that.  You're wrecking the timing of the bit.  You call him nicotine.  What?  That's what's in a cigarette.  Nicotine. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, nicotine.  That's what I said.  Nicotine.  Okay.  Enjoy Lucky Strike cigarettes.  And enjoy your whiteness.  And the whiteness of your neighborhood.  Your family.  Your workplace.  The water fountain.  The buses.  Every place in America.  Lucky Strike.  The official cigarette of the Send Them Back to Africa campaign.  Feel that draw. 
[02:30:30]  The pleasure of smoking and living in a white country.  After you sick the German shepherds on some Negroes, enjoy Lucky Strike cigarettes.  They're wonderful like white people.  They just all sound like that.  You can tell it's old.  Right.  There's something about the sound you can tell.  There's just that sound of rampant racism in it. 
[02:31:00]  Let's try a cigarette spot for Montclair.  Montclair.  Montclair.  Montclair cigarettes.  Montclair cigarettes.  Now, a cigarette that's low in tar and nicotine.  High in menthol flavor.  New Montclair.  Just enough in every puff.  Makes every puff a pleasure.  How much is just enough?  Just enough menthol to please your taste.  Montclair's new charcoal menthol filter does it. 
[02:31:30]  Charcoal granules that are both activated and mentholated release just enough menthol to freshen every puff.  So every puff tastes as good as the first puff.  What's so modern about Montclair?  Modern.  The answer is in Montclair's modern menthol flavor.  Yet Montclair is surprisingly low in tar and nicotine.  But the flavor's still there when you smoke Montclair.  The flavor just enough in every puff.  Makes every puff a pleasure. 
[02:32:00]  Smoke Montclair.  New from the American Tobacco Company.  Mmm.  That sounds good.  More mellow.  Yeah, that's a mellow one.  You want another lucky strike?  We'll try one more lucky strike.  Lucky.  Places all.  All joint hands.  Circle lift.  Now circle right and listen to me.  L-S-L-S-M-F-T.  Elemental corners like swinging on a gauge.  You're right to your honey with a right to your left eight.  Grand right to your left around you go.  Lucky strike means find a back goal. 
[02:32:30]  Meet your honey and give her a whirl.  All swing around with your little girls.  Smoke them, smoke them.  Then you'll see.  L-S-L-S-M-F-T.  Promenade and don't you fall.  Promenade around the hall.  Lucky strike is first again.  First again with tobacco men.  Promenade straight down the pike.  It's time right now for a lucky strike. 
[02:33:00]  Yes, first smoking that you're bound to like.  You just can't beat a lucky strike.  Yes, they're playing that chicken-picking music.  I hope whoever wrote that never smoked and still got cancer.  Swing up, partner, to and fro.  Look around, no black sample.  Ah, yes, lucky strike, the wonderful flavor.  Taste the draw of lucky strike as you drop your children off at an all-white school. 
[02:33:30]  No Negroes here.  The only place you want charcoal is in your filter.  The charcoal filter of lucky strike.  Wonderful.  That's also the only place you want tar, baby, is in your cigarette.  Not walking the streets of your all-white neighborhood.  Lucky strike.  What a wonderful cigarette.  Good for dining, dancing, or lynching.  Light up a lucky strike. 
[02:34:00]  You could light it off your zippo lighter, a match, or a burning cross on a Negro's lawn.  Whatever it takes, light up that lucky strike.  You know why lucky strike cigarettes are so good?  Look at them.  They're white.  That's right.  When have you ever saw a black cigarette?  Never.  Because it couldn't possibly be good.  Lucky strike with their wonderful white paper.  Smoke luckies.  Because we don't like Negroes. 
[02:34:30]  There it is.  What a time.  What a time we lived in.  I think we have one more for lucky strike.  Lucky again?  I mean, no, let's try a Newport.  Another Newport ad.  These were boring, though, right?  We didn't like the first one.  I don't know.  It's kind of jazzy.  Scooby-Doo-Wah-Wah.  Smooth and fresh is the Newport taste. 
[02:35:00]  Never harsh, never rough.  The smoothest-tasting menthol cigarette.  Wah-wah.  King Size and New Deluxe 100s.  Little tune written for a cigarette ad, 1936.  You think she had to kill the cigarette because it was talking to her?  That voice.  Do you notice that the menthol ads have a cool, mellow thing? 
[02:35:30]  That was the message that was from.  Mellow, jazzy.  You hang back and have a menthol, man.  Right.  But the other cigarettes, lucky.  Smoking lucky.  Let's say hi to John in Jersey.  Of course, Jersey again.  John?  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, bitch dit?  Hi, John.  I don't appreciate that type of language.  I just want to tell you guys, when Anthony said he was going to stick to German Shepherds,  I almost drove into a ditch. 
[02:36:00]  You guys rock.  Thanks.  This is the part of the program where we allow you to compliment the bit.  Oh, thank you.  I'm tearing down the third wall for everyone, Anthony.  So we could feel a little better about ourselves.  What's that?  What is that, Eric?  I have no idea.  Eric, what are you doing?  A pack of Marlboros.  You ever heard that theory that the Marlboro box was designed like the KKK thing, the hoods  and the way you do it?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That's been around for years, that theory.  Yeah.  There are all kinds of rumors like that.  Yeah. 
[02:36:30]  All right.  Well, I don't think Marlboro is in cahoots with the clan.  This is the new and improved O.P. and Anthony show, so we don't beat things into the ground.  So we're going to try not to.  We're going to say cut right there.  All right.  And end the bit.  End the bit.  Bravo to Anthony.  The bit is over.  Coming up with that on the fly.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you for the musical accompaniment in there.  Derek.  The only time you want tar, baby, is in your cigarette.  That was great.  Richard, Jenny, coming up.  No, I didn't live in those times. 
[02:37:00]  I was saying those were some...  Guy's like, how old are you?  No, I wasn't around during those.  Yeah.  That's right.  Sure.  It's called a bit, silly.  All right.  Oh, God.  Yeah, me, Burt Lancaster.  We would go out and smoke.  Okay.  I'm trying to find something to play, go into the break.  Eh, I don't have nothing.  No?  Oh, I know what you could play.  What? 
[02:37:30]  Oh, you don't have it.  Oh, man.  Let me get it.  Shut up.  No, that was the worst acting ever.  Oh, Jimmy does that.  Oh, what about that thing?  What?  Forget it.  No, there was some great bits off of, what the hell is that CD?  Yellow Discipline.  Oh.  Dude, if you brought that in, we'd play something on the break every once in a while.  I'm too humble.  Let me go.  The CD's great, and he wants one of us to bring it in.  No, no, no.  I wouldn't.  So that way it's not like...  All right.  I would bring in Jim Norton's Yellow Discipline CD so we could play some tracks every once in a while.  It's very funny.  And you can get the CD off eatabullet.com. 
[02:38:00]  It's a very funny CD.  I would just be embarrassed.  I can't listen to myself in front of people.  It's embarrassing.  Well, someone will bring it in and we'll play some tracks every once in a while.  Look who's here.  Who?  Who?  Stalker Patty.  Why?  I see her sitting out there.  She's got presents or something?  Supposedly more Christmas presents?  Correct.  Isn't it like February?  Hi, Patty.  How are you?  That's good.  When my friend Jen was in from out of town, she actually wanted to meet Patty at the Brooklyn Diners.  She's like, I hope she's here. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, like a celebrity.  Yeah, she's become a celebrity.  Our stalker has become a celebrity.  That's really good.  Nightmare.  Wonderful.  Well, you know, I've heard a lot of radio over the years.  This is probably the worst.  Way back in the middle 60s, there was a small station outside of Moline, Illinois.  I believe it was WRCW.  I'm not sure of the call letters.  1590 Day Timer.  I signed off at Sunrise.  Sunset, rather.  They were pretty bad.  They were pretty, pretty darn bad. 
[02:39:00]  But this is probably worse.  Agapame to Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  XM 202.  Jesus, didn't we just break?  No, I got to pee.  I didn't even pee.  I haven't peed yet.  I got to pee.  I had enough time to stand up, stretch my legs, and sit back down. 
[02:39:30]  I'm going to go to the restroom and do a little docking.  Huh.  Why not?  Who's going to be the peeler?  I'm not a peeler.  You've got to find a peeler.  I'm clipped.  Of course.  All civilized people are, eh?  I wish I wasn't.  Where's our coffee?  I want my coffee.  You ever see those circumcised guys that have this organization to try to get their foreskin back?  I read about that in, I guess, Penthouse or something years ago.  They attach weights onto the skin of their penis. 
[02:40:00]  Yes.  Around the head.  And walk around with these weight devices to try to pull the skin over the top to once again give them a peeler.  Why don't they just use, like, chewed bubble gum?  Just wrap it around.  Wrap it around your helmet.  How many times I got to tell you?  Not too many more.  It's going to be like a, I don't know, a penis toupee.  Yeah.  Something like that.  Gum toupee. 
[02:40:30]  Mm-hmm.  You're lying.  No, he's not.  The people do want that.  Yeah.  My friend had, his got messed up, and he had two pieces of skin.  Who, Colin?  No, not Colin.  His did get messed up.  He said that.  Heard about that on Tough Crowd, right?  On Tough Crowd, he talked about it.  But my friend had two pieces of skin going, like, from, it's almost like, how can I picture this?  From the head to the shaft, two little thin pieces of skin still connecting.  Oh, God.  Oh, God. 
[02:41:00]  I got messed up a little bit in the back.  What?  Nothing bad.  It's just, like, a little bit choppy in the back of my mule.  In the back of your mule?  No, nothing horrible.  Just a little bumpy.  Yeah, it looks like.  A little choppy?  It's always been that way, because I guess the guy was scoffed in the middle of it.  Yeah.  Yeah, that should be the most important thing the guy that's doing that does.  It shouldn't be some willy-nilly thing, because you've got to live with it the rest of your life.  It's a brutal practice.  At least they do it when you're infant, so you don't even remember it. 
[02:41:30]  It's like your helmet's supposed to be very sensitive and all.  It's like you need the protection there.  That's why you have it.  Yeah.  Yeah, I would love to have that protection.  You would?  Sure.  I'm kind of fine with it just being clipped like that.  It doesn't really...  You don't notice it.  Like, it's not sensitive rubbing on your pants as you're walking or anything.  You kind of don't think about it.  But it might be more sensitive if you didn't.  I don't know.  If you have it, I hear about hygiene issues with people.  I think it's a myth.  As long as you're clean.  Yeah?  Yeah.  As long as you...  What I would do is just take a...  It's just another fold that has to be cleaned. 
[02:42:00]  That's true.  Like a horse sheath.  Oh, the horse sheath where they're pulling that beef jerky out of there.  My friend did that.  She had a horse and she had to put gloves on.  You had to go up in with some sort of Vaseline or whatever and pull stuff out because the  horse rubs on the ground.  I saw that video online.  It's called Horse Gag.  Yeah, it's hot.  All right, guys.  Moving on.  Yeah, what do we got?  Uh, they found our buddy.  Uh, Jason.  Jason, uh, like I said, the show's always a work in progress, so we'll wrap up another 
[02:42:30]  storyline.  Our buddy from nyconfidential.com has been arrested, Anthony.  Has been arrested.  Aw, where'd they nail him?  Can you give like a 30-second, um, explanation here?  I mean, I'll read the story, but the lead up here.  He's the guy that brought us girls in here, uh, in the studio.  And, um...  And Jim, um...  Jim...  Jim had sex with one of them.  Oh, yeah, I hung with him.  I went to his place.  Jim had the girlfriend experience.  Yeah.  And why confidential?  You go to the site, you pick a girl, uh, and what, they deliver them? 
[02:43:00]  Don't know.  My thing was I just went there and hung, and they had beds in there.  You just hung?  No, no, no.  You know, I'm saying, you know what happened.  Or hang?  You ate ass.  Oh, that's right.  I caught the ass flu.  My point is not that.  I know that.  But the thing is, I went and hung out in the place, talked to him.  He jidge.  He jidge.  You got the ass-eating flu.  So what?  So what?  Beats getting it from holding a handrail on a train.  You're going to get it from a nine and a half.  And I cursed out the lawyer lady big time in Washington because I was pissed off because 
[02:43:30]  he gave us all free hours to do with what we will, and I'm not into the thing, the prostitute  thing.  So I was going to give it to one of our listeners or the intern or somebody, and lawyer lady  put the kibosh on it, and I was cursing her out.  But I guess she made the right decision.  Maybe he did.  You never know.  As far as that goes.  But the head muckety-muck.  Jason.  The head guy, Jason.  Really good guy, by the way.  Really nice guy.  In charge.  Huge fan of the show, too.  So the Post, big headline, Pimp King Bust. 
[02:44:00]  He was found in Chelsea.  A multi-million dollar pimp is behind bars, charged with running a massive Manhattan call  girl ring.  Massive, there's now saying, Anthony.  Boy, he really ran, didn't he?  What was the term?  Chelsea, they found him.  In a cab.  She hopped in a cab.  What was the term they used yesterday?  Notorious, right?  Notorious.  We love that word, instead of shock jocks.  Massive Manhattan call girl ring, and now he's wanted by authorities in two other states  for drug possession.  Stalking and breaking parole.  Stalking?  Yeah.  They busted Jason, owner of NY Confidential, at Chelsea's Gazenboot Hotel. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, it's one of those fancy schmancy hotels.  A fancy hotel?  He should have been in a dive.  Yes.  With a flashing red neon light out your window.  He was, yeah, they caught him this week, days after seven of his employees were nabbed  in a raid in his Worth Street headquarters, Anthony.  Jason, whose high-priced escort business ranked in at least $3.6 million a year, was charged  with drug possession, promoting prostitution, money laundering, and falsifying business records. 
[02:45:00]  Drug possession.  That means when they caught him, he had drugs on him?  Maybe it was a previous charge.  I don't know.  Maybe when they searched his offices, they found drugs.  I don't know.  All right.  He's also in hot water in New Jersey, where he's on parole from state prison after serving  six months of a five-year sentence for smuggling nearly 4,000 hits of ecstasy.  How do you get out after six months on a five-year?  Nonviolent crime, I guess.  Maybe it was his first offense.  So New Jersey is sending him back to the slammer.  Oh, this guy's screwed, man. 
[02:45:30]  He's going to be in for a while now.  Meanwhile, authorities searched Jason's Hoboken apartment with drug-sniffing dogs.  Wow, man.  Oh, my God.  They went all out for this one.  And found, among other things, prescription drugs for which he did not have prescriptions.  The fine is expected to result in drug charges.  And in Florida, where Jason once ran a lucrative 900-number phone sex business, he's won on a  felony stalking warrant, according to authorities.  Details of the warrant weren't immediately available. 
[02:46:00]  Well, how can he stalking him?  He's in New York.  Well, it says Jason has a history of abusive and threatening behavior.  He was arrested in Jersey in 2000, and again in 2003, for beating up his then-girlfriends.  Hmm.  Just seeing what else is in here.  A quarter-million-dollar bond, or a $150,000 cash bail.  I'll try to find that thing he gave me.  When I went there, him and Natalia, I sat down with them and watched the little piece they 
[02:46:30]  put together for a reality show, possibly, for New York NY Confidential.  It was me, him, and Natalia sat and watched it.  A reality show on prostitution.  About that, yeah.  Perhaps you should keep that stuff private.  Well, that was the problem, because it ends with, Jason's sudden fall shocked many in  the city's sex industry, who said he often bragged of close relationships with the cops.  Yeah.  You can't do that.  Yeah, because the lieutenants get aggravated.  It's not the street guys that you need.  Those guys love you, but it's the guys above them, the captains who are all old-school 
[02:47:00]  religious.  Yeah.  We learned the hard way, and we'll tell you in a second.  And then it ends, I guess this is a quote that he said in the Post last month, I hire off-duty  cops to do my security.  I have the cops on my side.  Oops.  Not the right thing to say.  Yeah, you got to keep that kind of...  See, we, in the old days, had the NYPD on our side, and they're still huge fans of the  show, and a lot of these guys are getting the XM for the cruisers and stuff, but we learned 
[02:47:30]  the hard way that it's the guys above our boys that are doing the real work on the streets  of New York and the surrounding areas that had the problem with the Voyager bus incident.  Yeah.  It's always the way.  You know, the cops, big fans of the show, they'll do anything to help.  Sometimes they shouldn't.  Sometimes they should steer clear and not get themselves involved, because when the brass  finds out, everyone gets in trouble.  And we had a couple of cops getting in trouble.  That kind of sucked.  The lieutenant says, go grab those guys. 
[02:48:00]  They got to do it.  Yeah.  Tell the lieutenant, well, I think they're funny.  Yeah.  I like them.  Oh, okay.  Carry on.  Next.  Yeah.  That's a bummer, because we had a lot of fun with Jason.  He's a nice guy and all.  God, I could have had three.  I'm going to regret that for the rest of my life.  He would have hooked me up with any girls I wanted.  Put it on the pile.  Yeah, you're right.  Things you're going to regret for the rest of your life.  Did you talk to the girl that...  Natalia, I talked to her yesterday.  I called her.  And?  Is she all right?  She's fine.  She's been out of there for a while.  She hasn't been there in a long time.  And she's like, I don't know what happened. 
[02:48:30]  I think she was telling the truth.  She's like, I haven't seen him in a long time.  I hope he's all right.  And she's been out of there for quite a while.  I guess I'm glad I kind of got her before she left.  I gave her a jingle.  All right.  Moving on, Anthony.  Jason busted.  We could get rid of that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hi.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How you doing, Dad?  Feeling fit?  Oh, hi.  Hi.  Hey, Steve.  What's up?  Hey.  Hey.  You know your old haunt, B-A-B?  Oh, that goes back away, right. 
[02:49:00]  Radio station?  Yeah.  Well, yesterday there was two hacks in the morning, because I can't get you guys in my office in  the morning.  We're talking about, you know, about the hookers with the hot dog truck.  And some asshole calls up and starts telling them about Craigslist and shit like that.  So you know it's only a matter of time before they start tracking down on that.  Craigslist is always in the news, though.  Craigslist, dude.  It's just the wording.  Craigslist staff cracks down on stuff that's really sexually explicit. 
[02:49:30]  But posting ads is one thing.  That's different.  When you're allowing an internet site just to be used for ads, that's different than running  an agency.  We're trying to get the guy that came up with Craigslist on the show.  I got you.  I think he's from San Francisco.  Is he?  I don't know.  It started there, right?  Ben's trying to get him.  Hey, can we now call Jason the Steve Rosenberger of hookers?  Sid Rosenberg, you horse's ass.  Oh, I'm sorry, Rosenberg.  I'm like, what is Steve Rosenberger?  All right.  Go ahead, Ben.  Get on mic.  Right idea.  Wrong, Joe.  Nothing.  No, this is the guy that founded Craigslist. 
[02:50:00]  I'm trying to get him on the show.  But that's what he does all day.  They sit and they go through all the postings and stuff because they're very careful with  that stuff.  Yeah.  And some get through that.  I've seen so many that I go to click on because, you know, my filthy taste.  Yes.  And they're like deleted by Craigslist staff.  Oh.  You're going to put something sexually suggested.  There's only so much they can do.  You can't be thought police.  Well, what is Craigslist?  It's a free site, craigslist.com.  And they go on.  Of course, I'm a pig, so I use it for sexual stuff.  But I've also used it for real estate.  But it's everything. 
[02:50:30]  Every major city in the country, you click on and they have all these categories of ads,  people looking for roommates, people selling real estate.  I mean, there's literally 50 different categories under services, under real estate, under, you  know, friendships and relationships.  But let's be honest, 99% of the time people are using it for sex, right?  No.  I'll bet you more often than not it's real estate and stuff like that.  Six million people use it for real estate alone.  I bet you real estate.  Wow.  Really?  Yep.  Because every time it comes up on this show, it's about finding a hooker. 
[02:51:00]  Because in New York, it's got a huge sex listing.  But other places, the sex listings are pretty small.  Oh, okay.  You go to like, even in Vegas, they might have 30 listings a day or 25.  You know, it's very small.  It's 75 cities.  And they're making a ton of money.  Well, let's get him on the show.  He seems like an interesting guy.  Is he a millionaire from that show?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's him and another guy.  This guy's 52 and he started in San Francisco.  How is he making money off it, though?  Because it's a free site.  I guess it's advertisers?  Yeah, probably.  I don't know how half these guys make money on these things.  What a genius, dude. 
[02:51:30]  He could be the worst looking guy I've ever seen.  Is his name Craig?  Obviously, you don't have a mirror.  Oh.  What's his name?  Oh, excuse me.  Let me just address it.  That's hysterical.  His name Craig?  Why did I try?  That was very, very hurtful and mean-spirited.  I missed it.  I was paying attention to herky-jerky Ben.  Well, his name is Craig, but that was a good line.  Well, I was good-naturedly pointing out that that's the worst looking person I've ever seen  creep over there going, I guess you don't have a mirror. 
[02:52:00]  Oh.  And he was implying.  Oh, that is awful.  That I'm a dumpy, awful man.  And I thought that was a little uncalled.  That was a little low.  I was hoping to get that under the radar.  That was a good one.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  That's all right.  All right.  It's not you I'm angry at.  You're not in charge of my genetics.  It's my parents, who I love very much, but neither one of them has a chin between them.  I look at my dad's chin.  I'm like, Jesus, I know where I get it from.  Really?  Yeah.  Weak chin.  Your parents are the greatest, though. 
[02:52:30]  They're wonderful people.  You just don't know it yet.  That's not true.  I love my parents very much.  I hung out with his parents a bunch of times.  I enjoy their company.  So do I.  But I just, they have weak chins.  They're great people, but they have weak chins.  Your mom is the sweetest person I probably have ever met.  Yeah, she is very nice.  I just don't get it.  They probably do the same thing when Opie's hanging out with them.  They probably, you know, look at Opie and think what it would be like to have him as his son.  I know, the successful one who doesn't have his face and chest uses a toilet occasionally. 
[02:53:00]  Christmas is around the Hughes household.  How's the show going?  Good, good.  Not, you really don't want people to doo-doo on you, do you?  I hope Mrs. Robinson is hearing this today.  Yeah, see?  So, Anthony, Brent and Jen is a big story.  Oh!  We're trying to develop this bit, but I don't know if it's going anywhere.  Just how useless this information really is.  I mean, the entertainment shows on TV are spending a lot of time talking about the breakup. 
[02:53:30]  It's the story as far as Entertainment Tonight goes and all of those Hollywood shows.  They cannot get enough info on these two.  They want to know why they broke up, when, who caused it, what are they going to do, where are they going, their money, new relationships.  Another reason why the rest of the world hates us, by the way.  Hates us, yeah.  You know, there's examples every day, but we're spending more on the Brad and Jen breakup than, you know, even like the tsunami stuff. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  Or the mudslide in California, as I look at Arnold walking around the mud.  I, I'm surveying the damage.  We're going to get to that in a few minutes.  So, uh, who's Clive Owen?  Do we know who Clive Owen is?  Sounds British.  Everyone in Hollywood has a, uh, a comment about this.  Yeah.  And some of them are kind of interesting, because it just shows how just ridiculous this whole situation is.  How meaningless.  Last night, E.T. spoke with Clive Owen.  He co-stars with Jennifer in the upcoming movie, Derailed, shooting rap just a few weeks ago. 
[02:54:30]  It's terribly sad, isn't it?  I mean, um, we, we had a fantastic time, Derailed, and the shoot went very well, and then, um, she went back home, and then that news broke.  I mean, it's always sad when people break up, isn't it?  No.  It's terribly sad.  Yes.  Especially in the wake of the, when you look at the mudslide in California, the guy lost his wife and three daughters.  I mean, that's a little annoying, but.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, the guy leaves to get ice cream for his little daughters, and loses his whole family in the mudslide.  That's terribly sad.  Not the fact that Brad and Jennifer broke up. 
[02:55:00]  I think they'll be fine.  And then it's always terribly sad when people break up.  No.  No, it isn't.  Yeah, terribly sad, because, uh, yeah, Brad Pitt won't be going out banging, like, everything that moves for the next couple of years to get it out of his system, right?  Get it.  And, and she won't be, uh, banging guys for the next, how, why is it sad?  This is the Hollywood mentality.  This is how they are.  Very self-important.  Everything revolves around the, the business, and all of them, and that, that little click. 
[02:55:30]  So, for, for him and others, yeah, it's terribly sad.  This is, this is their tsunami.  Their tragedy.  Their mudslide.  Marlon Brando is very realistic about acting.  He said, acting is a worthless profession.  I love, Brad.  He just didn't want to talk about acting as a, when we, when we, when we.  My craft.  He could care less.  My craft.  Uh, Larry King's like, you're an actor.  He's like, eh, we're all actors, Larry.  Remember, he was like, kiss me.  Yeah, Larry, rub my feet.  That was, that was one of the best of years ever. 
[02:56:00]  He was one of the weirdest asses.  He was a nut.  But he just, not that, I mean, look, I admire actors, and what they do is actually hard.  But it's just, there is a self-importance.  I wish we had audio of Sean Connery at the Oscars, like, two years ago.  Yeah.  When he made this opening speech as to how important the movies are.  Yeah.  Whatever it was he said, I wanted to spit in his wife-beating face.  He would have slapped you silly.  He certainly would have.  He would have kicked your ass.  I would have put on a dress and been righteously beaten.  Oh, by the way, I know who Clive Owen is.  He's an actor.  Oh, thank you. 
[02:56:30]  We have audio of Marlon Brando trashing Burt Reynolds that Eric is pointing out here.  Oh, yeah.  By the time you get the bells over it and all that stuff, who the f*** is going to know?  I don't think it's Burt Reynolds.  That's one of the reasons we're doing that.  Don't say that name around me.  Do you not like him?  He is the epitome of something that makes me want to throw up.  He's a nice guy.  He is?  You want to come in here?  Well, I don't know why I hate him.  So he is a nice guy, is there a thing?  He can't be. 
[02:57:00]  He's the epitome of everything that's disgusting about the thespian.  Just holy.  I don't know him at all.  He worships at the temple of his own narcissism.  You want to try?  Totally a narcissistic person.  I don't want to meet him either.  Get in there.  Let's get this thing.  You know what really disgusted me?  I saw him on the TV one time. 
[02:57:30]  It was at an opening of some movie he did called The Cat Dancing.  And he had ordered some Indian kids there because it was a little anti-Indian.  And he wanted to make some compensations for it.  So he ordered a little Indian kid there brought in from someplace.  So the kid was brought in.  It was about a three or four year old kid.  And he wanted to show how loving he was to the kid.  So he stooped down and was playing for the cameras of, oh, how I love children and that kind of thing. 
[02:58:00]  And the kid started to go away to go off camera.  So he pulled the kid back and was trying to make the kid make a little scene of how sweet Bert was in respect to children.  But it was such a shitty, the whole idea of it, hustling children so you could project, no, I don't know.  And the great thing about kids though, they can't be bulls**t.  Yeah, the kid wouldn't play the bulls**t.  They wouldn't do the bulls**t. 
[02:58:30]  Just wanted to go back to his mother.  How do you not love Brando?  How does anybody not love that guy?  Was he giving that little interview from a cave?  Can't you just picture him sitting in there in Southeast Asia somewhere in some hut?  I'm thinking that's a Poplar's Now audio for some reason, like off camera.  That's what it sounds like.  Coppola.  His temp worships at the temple of his own narcissism on the edge of a straight razor. 
[02:59:00]  Are you a bandit?  That's what he sounded like.  Boy, he didn't like Burt Reynolds.  No.  He loves the Indians.  He certainly does.  So anything anti-Indian really pisses him off.  I heard that on the set of Dr. Moreau, which was an awful film, but he's just great to watch no matter what he does.  I heard that, who was it, Val Kilmer was acting up or just being difficult.  And Brando said, son, I think you're confusing your salary with your talent.  Oh, jeez, that's a good one.  That is a good one. 
[02:59:30]  Did you hear that coming from the, what are you going to do, argue with Brando?  No.  Who are you, Godfather on the waterfront?  Stick around and desire?  Besides those things.  On Wally Cox's mule?  Everywhere.  There were some rumors.  All right, here's another Hollywood.  Any more Brando clips?  No, unfortunately not.  That's a good one.  Maybe we can find some more.  Amanda Byram?  Something like that?  Talking about the Brad and Jennifer breakup.  A little shitty thing to do.  Shitty thing. 
[03:00:00]  Amanda Byram, host of the new British version of E.T., feels that nothing will affect their stature as superstars.  I don't think there's anything that Brad Pitt or Jennifer Aniston can do wrong.  I mean, Jennifer Aniston, you know, Rachel and Friends, everybody loves her.  Brad Pitt, he's been, you know, a movie star since Elma and Louise.  And, you know, they're in it for the long haul.  They're A-listers for the long run.  Because here's the other thing.  It's going to ruin their A-list celebrity status.  Yeah.  Because they broke up.  Who's Elma and Louise?  Did you hear that stupid line?  Ha, ha, ha. 
[03:00:30]  It's Elma and Louise.  Stupid.  And then the final one is David Cassidy and Danny Bonaduce.  Oh, fake brothers.  Yeah.  I like that.  But Danny, you know, he pretty much nails it.  But leave it to David Cassidy and Danny Bonaduce to play point-counterpoint during last night's taping of an upcoming episode of ABC's Less Than Perfect.  I think, really and truly, we need to be much more sensitive of who they are as human beings. 
[03:01:00]  Oh, that's David Cassidy.  Shut up.  Much more sensitive.  Just shut up.  The man makes $20 million a picture.  He didn't give up his right to privacy.  He sold it to me.  And I won it.  Oh.  That's a fact.  Doochie.  He wasn't thinking that when the paparazzi was chasing him after punching a tranny in the face, was he?  That's true.  He was a little upset at his lack of privacy when it came to banging a tranny.  I worked with him once.  I tried to bond with him over that. 
[03:01:30]  That was years after I had my big back for a girl experience.  Yeah.  So I'm talking to him, and I'm like, yeah, man, I had the same thing one time.  I thought it was a chick, and I'm rubbing her back.  He didn't even acknowledge I had spoken.  Really?  He was actually not bad to me, but just that he didn't want to bring that up.  Didn't want to talk about it.  Some open-miker that I was.  And he was, but headlining, because he's famous.  Famous?  I don't know for that.  Anybody's a famous guy.  When we get back, I think Richard Jenny will be checking in.  There's also Joe Rogan and, oh, Arnold.  Are you calling in? 
[03:02:00]  No, no, no.  Arnold.  Was Arnold calling in?  No, no.  I, no, no.  We have audio.  In a world.  Because he's the governor.  I'm the governator.  He went to, visited the mudslide site, because he's the governor.  And it's kind of odd.  I was watching it on the news, and it's like weird, because usually you see governors or  presidents going to these locations, but it's a big movie star guy.  The thing to do is to stand on the pile.  And you have, yeah, stand on the pile and watch the rescuers digging. 
[03:02:30]  But you've got to know they were asking for autographs, you know?  Well, there he is.  It's Arnold.  Let me get an autograph picture.  The little Jimmy Norton would have been there inappropriately asking him for a picture  on top of the mound.  He's comforting the grieving person.  I would have said, Arnold, I don't mean to interrupt, but look, I've got to go.  Arnold, please, I don't mean to interrupt, but I'm trying to comfort somebody here.  I've been getting rejected a lot lately, and I never got rejected.  Boy, it's all coming back now.  Coming back to Hawkeye.  And they're all going to pay.  I can't wait until that big-ton ass calls in to try to hawk some more drivel. 
[03:03:00]  Oh, brother.  The pride of the Serengeti.  Opie and Anthony.  Ian Anthony, XM202.  Unbelievable. 
[03:03:30]  Unbelievable.  I'm the only one that didn't get to take a leak.  This break was so short, no one's back from the break yet.  I guess Opie and Jimmy still in the bathroom.  And I was walking out, ready to take a leak.  I forgot, and a good thing, I forgot the key to the men's room.  I figured it would be open, like Jimmy or Opie would have left it open or something.  No.  So I walk up, and I go back to get the key, and Eric tells me, hey, we're back on the  air.  Oh, wow.  So I don't get to take a leak.  No one's here in the studio. 
[03:04:00]  He's like, you guys are back on the air.  Yeah.  So I have to run in, still bladder full of urine.  Well, Opie just, we were just chatting in the bathroom, talking about my dumb Chicago  flight.  He's like, do you think I got time to take a dump?  Oh, no.  Right now.  He's taking a dump in there?  Stupid is on the ball, so I waited for a couple of seconds, so I thought he'd settled in,  and I just shut the lights off and walked out of the bathroom.  That's what you do.  So I'm hoping he's right now duck walking with a log hanging out, trying to get the lights  back on.  Yesterday, we all went to the bathroom together, as we sometimes do.  And Jimmy, notorious for turning the lights out when we're in there. 
[03:04:30]  It's a great gag.  Those bathrooms are pitch black in buildings.  You know, rarely have a window in there.  The things are open in five-degree weather.  So I'm just about done, and the light goes out, and I'm used to it.  But I didn't know there was anybody else in there, and there was some guy just from the  building, and he's sitting in the stall, and you just hear, hey, turn the light back  on.  And there he is, just dumping in the dark.  When I was doing Last Comic Standing in New York, we were doing the semifinals. 
[03:05:00]  I went into the bathroom, and I got somebody so good.  That was shot in a hotel on, like, 50-something Street, the Hudson Hotel.  And I got this.  I shut the lights off in the men's room, and I walked out, and this guy was screaming  in the hotel.  It was like a big lobby.  Who the fuck turned off the lights?  Somebody turned off the fucking lights!  He was as angry as I've ever seen anybody about anything.  And there's, like, a bunch of people in the hallway. 
[03:05:30]  He was screaming.  Dude, I got the aftermath, though.  So I'm in this stall, dumping, and there's another guy dumping, and you turn off the  light.  Just now?  Yeah.  I know the gag, and I'm just like, ugh.  Who cares?  Because he's done it a million times, right?  This guy obviously was reading, like, it had to be the New York Times, because all you  hear is, give me the papers.  Give me the papers.  I need the papers.  I don't want to mess with me.  I have nowhere to slam this, but basically all you hear is, son! 
[03:06:00]  Slams the paper down, you hear a belt, and then he waddled out.  Oh, that clanking of the dump belt.  He waddles out of the stall, and he, yeah, he doesn't have the, the belt is, yeah, whatever.  Clanging.  Clanging, thank you.  And he clangs past me, turns the light on, and goes back, and then you hear, with the  paper, and he goes back into position.  Well, you know, when he sat back down, and his cheeks opened up, it was probably like  chewing bubblegum, because you know he didn't wipe, he just jumped up. 
[03:06:30]  He couldn't do the duck walk all the way over to the light switch.  It was really funny, because I'm like, ugh.  Whatever.  Just sit there and take it, duty boy.  Annoying.  Good thing it wasn't Ben.  And then, oh.  And then stupid stalker Patty's outside the studio.  You know, you're back on the radio, and they're talking about you.  You're back on the, uh, I think you need to be back in the studio.  You know, I think Anthony could handle it by himself.  Yeah, I could handle it if I didn't have to piss so badly.  I went up to go to the bathroom, and I forgot the key, which is a good thing, or all three 
[03:07:00]  of us would have been in there, and nobody would have been here to return to the program.  It'd be funny if we came back, and it was the Eric and Derek show, and they wouldn't  let us in.  All of a sudden, it was a big hit.  Oh, great story for E.T.  We're out of a job.  Oh, here's the men's room, okay, great.  You can run in there if you want, if you really gotta go.  Oh, I can wait till the next three second break.  Give him a cup.  Good.  Give the boss a cup.  Come back with a little wet spot by my zipper because I couldn't shake. 
[03:07:30]  I couldn't shake enough, not enough time.  Anthony, this was your, uh, nice.  Uh, this was your pickup.  Um, I didn't even know Arnold was, uh, doing a press conference or whatever from this,  uh, the mudslide.  Oh, yeah.  Anytime Arnold's out, uh, I gotta check it out.  Saw it on the news.  Figured, let's hear it.  Because, you know, you don't really get to hear Arnold being governor.  Maybe in California you do, but around the rest of the country, we kind of heard his campaign  and everything, and then nothing.  He gave a state of the state, uh, address. 
[03:08:00]  State of the Union?  No, state of the state.  That's state of the state.  Because he's only the governor.  Ah, right.  Ah, and I didn't even hear it.  I would have loved to have heard him saying stuff like California.  But the state of California is larger than, uh, a lot of countries.  Yeah.  Ah!  So this is all you?  He grunts and groans his way through this, and, uh, he, the first question he's given,  he's gotta pass off to a fireman or something.  Because he's, he's an actor.  He doesn't know anything.  I am going to increase the budget of the transit in this, uh, shut up. 
[03:08:30]  You know, everyone's pushing for him to be president.  They want to change the amendment and all that?  Just because he's a movie star.  Right.  If he was just some guy, Arnold Schwarzenegger from Nazi Germany, wherever he came from.  Austria.  Yeah, Austria.  He, you think we'd be clamoring?  Oh, this guy ought to be president.  You'd be like, he's governor.  Throw him out of the country.  But we love his movies.  Love the action movies.  He'd actually run into the presidential platform if Kurt Waldheim was a moderate.  Oh, wow. 
[03:09:00]  Ah, lovely.  All right, here's Arnold.  Here's Arnold.  In the past few days, we have seen the power of nature cause damage and despair.  But we will match that power with our own resolve.  Like I'm matched.  And we will come together as Californians and as neighbors.  So thank you very much.  If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.  I don't know all the details.  I just got here. 
[03:09:30]  I just wanted to see it myself.  It's very important as governor to see, you know, the damage so that you can coordinate  and work as quickly as possible because the key thing here is quick response.  I also want to declare a state of emergency for Ventura County.  So thank you very much.  And any questions, please?  I'm going to ask you a couple of questions.  I want them answered immediately.  I, uh, state of emergency.  You know, I remember when I was Douglas Quaid in Total Recall, that was state of emergency 
[03:10:00]  when I hit the button with the three-finger thing that Quato told me to hit.  Quato.  Why did I say Quato?  And then my head, my eyeballs were bugging out.  But then they went back in and it looked like a big landslide of smoke and air that filled  up the atmosphere.  So I know exactly what these people are going through.  When I was a Terminator, you know, the power that I had is like the power of the landslide 
[03:10:30]  to ruin houses and kill families.  You know, but instead of me knocking on your door going, Sarah Connor here, it's a lot  of mud knocking on your door, taking your children.  So I understand as the governor.  This guy is just a movie star who really, I don't think, is equipped for disasters like  this.  He doesn't know how to handle that.  And they're asking him all these awkward questions like, has he comforted the families?  What's he going to do?  Come here.  Yeah.  Big arm around him. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah.  Let me, let me pose for you.  Would you like the picture of Arnold?  I'll sign it for you.  Maybe that'll, you know, ease your pain of losing your wife and three children.  You know, I lost a lot of people in the movie when I was Ben Richards in The Running Man.  I knew a lot of people that died.  And I got over it.  You should too.  You know, it happens movie to movie.  What? 
[03:11:30]  He doesn't, he's not set up for this.  At what point does the government have a responsibility not to let people live in a no-munch-like area or  give it up to the individual homeowner to take that risk?  Where does the government's responsibility end when the personal responsibility begins?  That's not a bad question.  That's asking where does the government's responsibility end and your responsibility as a human being  who's living on the side of a mountain.  The responsibility should be simple. 
[03:12:00]  You live here.  This could happen.  Right.  Your choice.  I saw some woman on the news yesterday saying they promised they were going to tear off  the mountain.  You know, get those railroad ties or something and make it steps.  They do that in snow areas.  Yeah.  All right.  I got it.  They did it and make a bunch of steps going down the mountain.  I thought you meant one wall of, yeah, one wall.  That was going to take care of the problem.  Sure.  And this woman's asking that.  And the truth of the matter is, whatever they promised, whatever, why would you move there  until they do that?  It could happen at any time. 
[03:12:30]  These mountains can come down.  And Arnold is just standing there talking to her like, yeah, tragic guy.  That's terrible.  Terrible thing that happened.  What could he say to her?  You know, it wasn't me that promised.  There is something honest about him that I like, though, as far as he's not a polished  politician.  He's not a polished politician.  But I think that kind of works against him sometimes because he doesn't know what to  react in these situations.  But these guys would have a scumbag, polished, dishonest answer.  They would give the right quote for the paper, but it would be disingenuous anyway. 
[03:13:00]  True.  Well, let's see what he says.  I would just go, look, I don't live here.  It's not my problem.  Good morning.  Good morning, Arnold.  The governor gets here.  Call me.  But, oh, I am the governor.  Wait a minute.  I'm Detective John Kimball.  Well, first of all, I was told that the residents knew that it was not the safest area.  I blame them.  Especially since the 1995 incident. 
[03:13:30]  And, but I think that it is very important that we always let the residents know.  What?  And I think there's a whole history here that maybe a fire chief that you maybe want to  address that.  Maybe a fire chief.  Doesn't know his name.  Guys, fire hats.  Right now, the beauty of California, we have oceans that cause wave issues on homes, earthquake  faults, rivers, and the mountains.  Stop whining.  It's part of the beauty of the state of California. 
[03:14:00]  Shut up.  And I don't believe that there's a way to really prevent people from invoking their private  property rights and living where they want to.  It's part of the system.  Stop whining.  Here in California and across the state.  Stop whining.  And I think that builds part of the ambiance of the environment that we live in.  It's just part of living here in the California.  Hi.  Governor, did you talk with any of those residents here who lost a loved one?  Did you console the loved one?  I talked to several of the residents here and I met with them just earlier because I wanted 
[03:14:30]  to hear from them of what their concerns are.  We obviously know that they are going through some very painful period here.  I like it.  And some of them have lost, you know, family and relatives, friends.  And it's terrible.  And my condolence goes out to them and their families and friends.  Did he have to say relatives and families?  Relatives, families, people they are related to, brothers, sisters, fathers. 
[03:15:00]  You know, I understand when I was major Dutch Schaefer in Predator, I had a lot of pain.  There was many things that went in my body.  Predator came out, pinned my neck to the log.  Remember that?  That was painful for me so I can relate to these people.  I feel your pain.  I toured the area in a helicopter with no weapons.  Why would they send me under?  I could have shot the dirt mount. 
[03:15:30]  This guy is an action hero.  He's an action hero.  And there he was on the news.  And people are asking him questions about a real live disaster.  But he's a movie guy and he's supposed to fix it.  But he's a movie guy that fixes things.  I'm stunned.  It's that whole crossover between reality and fantasy that is going on.  Well, Reagan became governor of California.  What did he do before then? 
[03:16:00]  Was he involved politically before then?  Yeah, he was always involved politically with something.  And he wasn't near the caliber of star that Arnold was.  I'm saying it wasn't his first public office, though, right?  No, I think he was president of the Screen Actors Guild or something.  Yeah, he definitely was.  So he was always politically involved with things.  And he kind of left acting at a younger age.  You know what I mean?  It wasn't like he went from acting to being the governor.  You know?  Kind of got into it.  This guy, I mean, you know, stepping right off the sets. 
[03:16:30]  In the middle of acting, right?  Yeah, in the middle of acting.  And there he is, you know?  It's just odd to watch.  It kind of makes the news less news-like when you watch it about the mudslide.  It's like, what is this movie?  What's this Arnold movie?  Chris from New Orleans.  New Orleans.  What's up, Chris?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  What's up?  What's going on, Snookum?  Hi, Chris from New Orleans.  We're hoping to get down there for Mardi Gras if we can get our airfare done before February.  I think we're going to book that today.  Oh.  Look out, New Orleans.  We're coming to Mardi Gras. 
[03:17:00]  What?  They let you drink here in the airport.  Right here in the airport.  Hurricanes.  Hey, I just want to know if Arnold cheered up the mudslide victims by covering himself in mud and retarding lines from Predator.  One lucky thing for the family is the Predator will never find them because they're covered in mud.  And as we all know, the Predator cannot find you if you're covered in mud, you bastard.  That's such a good joke.  Oh, man, Chris.  That is funny. 
[03:17:30]  You had the log before?  I didn't even realize they were covered in mud.  That is perfect.  You genius.  Ah, maybe I could be Mr. Freeze and I could have froze the mud before it hit the houses.  They would have gone, why is the mud not destroying a house?  And I could say, because me, Mr. Freeze, I froze it coming down the mountain.  Thank your governator.  Governator.  Did he say that?  He has said it. 
[03:18:00]  The press called him that or called him that when he was running.  It was everything.  I will terminate the tax burden on...  Oh, you're not terminating anything.  You're a real guy.  Can we play one of our favorite things?  A little piece?  Of course.  I've been dreaming of going to Mars 
[03:18:30]  Where mutants drive plastic cars  So I go there  You know the rest  The best part is the girl with three breasts  Tortorery  Dylan  Recalling  Total re-recalling

You got O.P., you got Anthony, you got Jim Norton  And I guess you overslept yesterday  Yeah, I'm a fucking idiot  I thought yesterday, for some reason  I thought it was Tuesday instead of Wednesday  Yeah  Because I was in Florida  And we flew back on Monday  Long story short  I'm retarded  I apologize  Well, you know  You're awesome  And I'll tell you why 
[03:22:00]  Because when Anthony and I  You and I talked about this  At the Comedy Store in L.A.  I bumped into you  By the way, I was just ranting and raving  About your comedy yesterday on the program  I mean, really smart, clever stuff  I really like your stand-up  Big time  Oh, thanks, man  Big time  And, you know, we got to talk after your set  And I got to thank you  Because after Ant and I got thrown off the air  For the St. Pat's incident  The whole stupid sex in the church thing  You went on a tear on your website  Talking about the whole thing  And supporting us  Well, I just couldn't believe 
[03:22:30]  That it was possible  That someone could get fired  Because some people fucked at a church  I mean, I thought that was  The dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life  That anybody would even care  What happens at a church  And people would freak out so much  And the best part about it  To this day, we really don't even know  If they had sex  The court couldn't even prove it  You know, but the media got hold of it  And just ran with it  And then, yeah  There was a panic  And they got rid of our asses  It's just so bizarre  I mean, people are just so fucking hypocritical  And so weird  And that it's 2005 
[03:23:00]  And this  Well, 2003 wouldn't happen  But 2005  And this shit is still going on  It's just insane  And hearing you guys on XM  Really opens everything up  Because, like  It's  Anybody who would be offended  By your regular show  Would be offended by your show on XM  It's the same people  Who are going to enjoy it, too  Right  But now they get to enjoy it  Like, for real  Now you get to say  Whatever the fuck you want  You get to do whatever you want  I mean, it's perfect  I mean, this is the way  It's supposed to be  I mean, I've had XM 
[03:23:30]  For, you know, like  Two years  And since you guys have been on  I don't even listen  To any of the other channels  Oh, wow  Nice  All I do  I used to just watch  The only time I used to  I used to just listen to  Bad talk radio  And get pissed off  Like, that was the only reason  Why I bought it for  You know, I'd listen to like  Like, the Glenn Beck show  And shit like that  Just to get annoyed  Like, the Michael Reagan show  Just to listen to idiots  I do the same thing  I listen to people  Or watch stupid shows on TV  Just to get pissed off  And people go  Why are you bothering  I'm like  Because I like getting annoyed 
[03:24:00]  Hey, Joe  You want to have some big laughs  Listen to John and Jeff  I think they're out of  Oh, oh  I've heard those fucking idiots  Oh, those are horrible  You've got to pull over sometimes  Oh, man  Those guys are really cards  I can't believe that  You know  That it's that easy  To get a job  And talk radio  I mean, it's just weird  Hey, man  Don't tell anyone, please  We've got a good gig here  But that's all I used to listen to  I just used to listen to it  You know, as a comic  But I don't want to hang out  With guys like  You know, Glenn Beck  Or Tony Snow  In real life  So I don't ever hear 
[03:24:30]  Anybody like that talk  In real life  Because if I hear someone  Like that talk  I just get the fuck away from them  But in the, you know  Comfort of my own car  I can listen to them  And get pissed off  And sometimes, you know  It's funny  You know  And sometimes you can get  Material out of it  Or something  But I don't even listen to it anymore  Since you guys have been out  I just listen to you guys all day  Hey, Joe  Getting back to the church thing too  You have some just great theories  On religion  You want to just throw  A couple out there?  Well, I mean, look  It's pretty obvious  That no one knows  What the fuck is going on  I mean  Religion is nothing but a cult 
[03:25:00]  It's just a cult  With millions of people in it  It's really obvious  I mean, anybody who reads  Any religion  Whether it's the Bible  Or the Torah  Or the Koran  Or any  If you actually read it  And you still believe it  You're a fucking idiot  I mean, it doesn't make any sense  It's completely ridiculous  And the fact that people  Are willing to argue about it  People lose their jobs  Because you make fun of it  I mean, it's weird  It's weird that people  Are so scared of the unknown  That they're willing to believe  Insane, stupid shit  Written by people  Who thought the world was flat 
[03:25:30]  And the sun was 17 miles away  I mean, especially when it comes  To the Catholic religion  I mean, I was raised Catholic  Yeah  I mean, how many little kids  Have to get fucked by priests  Before everybody goes  Hey, wait a minute  Yeah, but that's not anything  To really look into  Nah, don't look at that  Better look at the radio shows  That are joking around  Yeah, people are using bad words  Yeah  You've got to put a stop to that  Yep  Unbelievable  It's just bizarre  It's just strange  That as a race  We can't get past that  It's just  It's very weird  Well, you've got to admit, though 
[03:26:00]  And I believe  I am not pro-religion  But if you're a priest  And you're around  A lot of these little youngsters  I mean, some of them  Are quite enticing  I mean, how much willpower  Can one of these fellas have?  Oh, dear  A little blonde lad  Easily influenced  Maybe if we just let them masturbate  They would blow off a little steam  Yep  Unless this would happen  Nah, that's against the rules, too  That's bad for you  Go to hell, right?  Hey, Joe  So, fear factor  We were just talking about  Well, you might even hurt us  We were live in Vegas 
[03:26:30]  Talking about the lawsuit  Some listener  Viewer  Sorry, viewer  Is suing because they got  What?  Sick because they saw  The rats in the blender thing  Yeah  Yeah, but the guy  Actually just got out of jail  For forgery  And some other kind of fraud  Yeah  He's actually been in jail  For two years  And he actually filed  A couple other lawsuits  So it's all bullshit  Yeah  Trying to make some quick money  When he got out  Well, that's the funny thing  It's all bullshit  But the media, you know  Runs with that as well 
[03:27:00]  But that certainly doesn't help  To hurt the show  No, not fear factor  Nothing can hurt it at this point  Anything really gross you out though  When you're watching it  Because I can't watch  Some of that stuff  Oh, constantly  Yeah  I mean, look  I'm much more jaded  Than I used to be  But it's still disgusting  I mean, the smells  Are the insane part  I mean, when you watch it on TV  You know, it looks gross  To see a blended rat  But to smell a blended rat  They don't just leave 
[03:27:30]  Whatever the smell is  The guy who runs  What we call the B-Stun program  B-Stun  Like, we have A, B, and C  The second son's the B-Stun  That's always disgusting  The guy who runs it  Is this guy Scott  And he's a sick fuck  I mean, he'll put like  All sorts of stuff  Into whatever they have to eat  To make it grosser  Like this disgusting Asian fish sauce  And he goes to  Like, a lot of the stuff  That's in it  That makes it gross  Is really like food  That somebody actually likes somewhere  Like, a lot of it 
[03:28:00]  Is really fucking  Ranked cheese  Cheese?  It's like the nastiest cheese  And it comes from like  Beverly, this Beverly Hills  Cheese shop  And it's really expensive  Wow  It smells like  90,000 different kinds of ass  It's so bad  But yet it's like  It's like some sort of a delicacy  So they take this fucking  Stank cheese  And they mix it in  With this fish sauce  And then sometimes  They'll pour like bile  And then on top of that  You have blended rat  So like, you don't even get  The full essence 
[03:28:30]  Of how gross it is  Yeah  We  The smell  We had rat cooking  On our show  When we were at  WNW  We actually had a French chef  Come in  And these were sewer rats  These were like subway rats  They weren't like pet rats  They were disgusting  Big and just gnarly  And people ate them?  Yeah, the cool thing is  The French chef  He cooked it in such a way  That people actually  Went back for seconds, Joe  Yeah, he made it like  This rat au plov  And it was supposed  To be a contest  We were supposed  To be grossing people out  And they enjoyed it 
[03:29:00]  They ruined it  Our whole goal  Was to get people to puke  We like when people  Puke on our show  And yeah  But the guy did  Too good of a job  Where they went back  For seconds  Yeah  Oh, that's funny  And we remember  The waffling  Of the cooking rat  Coming into the studio  We were getting so sick  To our stomach  Because then we had  Another guy  That didn't know  What he was doing  And he's  He made just a mess  Of a dish  And then that's when  We got the people  To puke  And it was radio gold  You must be really used  To seeing people  Puke these days 
[03:29:30]  Oh, it doesn't bother me  At all  And you know something  Isn't it always funny  Oh, it's always funny  The funny thing is  NBC doesn't let us air that  Right, right  Like you can air  A guy gagging on a plate  Full of animal dicks  Like that's okay  Yeah  But when it comes down  To, you know  Actually showing them  Throw up  Ooh, that's offensive  Yeah  Yeah  All that doesn't make sense  We talk about that  On a daily basis  You know, you can show  Dead people on TV  From the tsunami  That's okay  But someone puking  On a goofy  Sorry, I don't mean  To call it a goofy show 
[03:30:00]  But you know what I mean  No, it is a goofy show  All right  I'm the first person  To call it a goofy show  All right  But, you know  A guy puking on Fear Factor  That's not okay  We can't handle that  In America  It's very weird  I mean, I show up  Every day at work  You know, whenever  I just show up there  I just go  Really?  We're still doing this  Okay, let's go  I'm amazed at some  Of the stuff that goes on  You know what is really  Frightening to watch  On Fear Factor?  Who do you have  Flying that goddamn helicopter?  That guy's insane  I've seen some turns  Over lakes  Where it looks like  The rotor's gonna hit the water 
[03:30:30]  Yeah, it's more of an illusion  Than anything  Really?  They're really good  Helicopter guys  Are you frightened  For people's lives sometimes?  Because you know  A lot of people  Watching that show  Going, someone's gonna die  I want to watch  Until somebody dies  I think if someone  Does die  What they're gonna do  Is kill everybody  And then blame it  On the terrorists  And then they'll be like  Oh, you guys already  Have a plan in place  I like that  Take away your fear factor  You know, it'll be like  You say, you know  Don't let them  Take away Fear Factor  With new host  Adam Carolla 
[03:31:00]  You know  Everybody beats Dad  You know  Joe, how many of those girls  Do you want to bang?  I saw the couple Fear Factor  The other day  This one short  She kind of looked Latin  I guess  With these massive boobs  And you can see it in your face  That you're having a tough time  Looking in the eye  About 20% of them  I probably would want to fuck  But it's really not a good idea  No, the host screwing the contestants  Is a little sleazy  Yeah, you know what  I'm a little sleazy  So I could probably get away with it 
[03:31:30]  But I just don't want the hassle  It just seems like  It would be a nightmare  Yeah  There's plenty of hot chicks in LA  It's just not worth the risk  So Pat's on the line  He's saying  Talk about Joe's car from TLC  What's that about?  Oh, there's a show on TLC  Called Rides  And they do all kinds of different cars  They showcase all kinds of different cars  Getting constructed  And they made me a 1970 Barracuda  Nice  It's sick  It's this 1970 Barracuda  They built it up with all modern stuff 
[03:32:00]  Like it's all modern suspension  And modern electrical system  And modern transmission  It's really cool  Very nice  So if you're into cars  I have a really cool  They made me this really cool Saturn  A couple of years ago  With the dealership  And I've been driving it  Like some suburban faggot that I am  Safety first  Oh, I really am a nerd  Safety first  He's driving a custom-made Barracuda  And I have a Saturn  God, do I suck  You can imagine what he's getting  I've seen it  It's amazing  No, I mean the chicks he gets  I know  Just the car alone 
[03:32:30]  Amazing  And you get trainees in Chelsea  That's good  I get trainees?  Trainees?  Trainee  Yeah, I never bang Clarice Starling  Hey, one thing I want to know  Because I've been listening all the time  Is that really Bernie Getz  Who called you guys?  Yes  He comes in  He comes in live  He's insane  Holy shit  That's really him  See, there's people around the country  That don't understand  How cool it is  That we got Bernie Getz  As a regular now  He just comes in  We had him guest DJing  The other day  When you guys had him on  I was like 
[03:33:00]  Wow, this guy's doing  Like a Bernie Getz impression  Or something  I don't know how accurate that is  And then the more I'm listening  I'm like  This guy's  Whoever's doing this  Is either really good  Or that's a really fucked up dude  The guy is out of his mind  We're just mesmerized by the guy  He's coming in with his inventions  In a couple weeks  Yeah, he invents things  He's got some levitation device  He's certifiable  But you know what the coolest thing is?  He told us kind of where he buried the gun  He used in the subway shooting  Up in Vermont somewhere  Oh, wow 
[03:33:30]  And we so want to send somebody up there  To try to dig it up  How cool would it be to have the gun  That he used  Man, that's something you put up in  You know, you hang that up on your wall at home  With Bernie Getz's gun  He got out years ago  He only did like  Eight months  Eight months  Eight months on a weapons charge  He didn't get any charges for assault or anything  Or attempted murder  Oh, wow  This guy is  What a fascinating idea  To get this guy on the radio  Who came up with that?  I think he was emailing us or something  Oh, no  Jimmy actually  Jimmy  Jimmy Norton 
[03:34:00]  It was my idea  But now the problem is  He won't leave us alone  He emails us all the time  He wants us to come over to his place  And smoke some dope  And we're going to take him up on that  I've got to see how he lives  I want to hang out in Bernie Getz's apartment  Yeah, because last time he was on  He was talking about how the  Bernie Getz  Last time he was talking about  How the squirrel talks to him  What was the word?  He's got a pet squirrel  And he says  The squirrel says stop  Stop  And you can only wonder  What he's doing  That the squirrel learned to say stop  When a squirrel learns speech  Just to say stop  After what digit  Doesn't say that, Bernie 
[03:34:30]  Yeah, the real problem is  When you guys get bored with him  And you decide you don't want to use him anymore  Right  He starts freaking  Yeah, and then what do we do, you know?  Yeah, he's been known to be a little ill-tempered  Yeah, don't ask him for five bucks  He's an OCD freak too, man  Everything has to be perfectly lined up  When he's in here  And he just  I don't know  We're fascinated by the guy  Oh, he's fascinating to listen to  Now that I know he's real  I'll be really fascinated  Oh, yeah, yeah  We were all too afraid to tell him  Like, could you just shut up  And focus on something  Finally, Anthony had the balls  To go, Bernie, Bernie  Focus, focus 
[03:35:00]  Focus  You sure do like to talk  You got goofed on him  He sounds like he's a little pissed off at you  He's all over the place  Yeah, I started playing  Some of those real bad racist songs  And I didn't know how he was going to take it  While he was talking  And there was one point  He gave me a look  And I'm like, well, maybe I should slow down  I was afraid he was going to get mad in the lead  Before I got my picture with him  I had to get a photo with him  He just looked like such a creep  But he didn't  He didn't get mad at him  No, he was great  He was great  So we got Bernie Getz and Joe Rogan  Those are our guests  Now, Joe's great  Joe, I mean, can you call us from time to time 
[03:35:30]  If you're listening  I mean, you got the number now  If you're hearing  Well, you're not going to hear us live, though  You'll hear us in the replay, I guess  Yeah, well, sometimes I'm coming home  I hear you guys live  I heard you guys this morning  All right  I mean, like, if you hear something  You want to comment on  This show is a work in progress  So, you know, you just call the next day  And add to something  It's so refreshing  I mean, it's so fun to listen to  It's literally like  I don't listen to anything else anymore  I mean, everything else just seems boring  All right  It's great  I mean, the only thing I used to listen to  Like I said, was talk radio  And, like, the Art Bell show  You know, I'd listen to that on the weekends 
[03:36:00]  Oh, Art?  Good old Art  From the Kingdom of Nye  What a weirdo he is  I love it  Yeah  I love  The UFO freak  No matter what you call in about  He's fine with it  Art, I'm a werewolf  Really?  That's great  Dude  You know, I just got back from the future  What is it like?  You can't throw Art, man  You cannot throw that guy  He seems to know what asses  Like, really, like, get into his show  And he's so good at not  Just not judging what they're saying 
[03:36:30]  Yeah, it's awesome  There's so many fucking idiots call in  It's amazing  But, it just  Like I said, it's so refreshing  Listening to your show  I'm so jealous  Like, I drive around  I'm listening to you guys  I'm like, god damn  They're having fun  That sounds like a fun fucking show  We have a whole channel  If you want to do an hour or two  Just let us know  We'll give you the time  Oh yeah, man  Anything you want to do  Well, next time I'm in New York  I have to come in  It's just  You guys are having too much fun  You got any gigs you want to promote either?  Because we're all over the country now  So any gigs you want to promote  You can promote 
[03:37:00]  I'm not even going on the road  For, like, another few months  So, you know  Fear Factor's done  Like, the first gigs I do  They start in, like, February  Oh, see, someone told me that this  Tomorrow and Saturday  You're going to be at Chicago's  Zany's in Vernon Hills  You ass, Jim  No, no, I heard  Rocky was going to be there tomorrow  Jim, that's where you're going to be  Oh, whore  I was thinking of stopping it  All right  I got, Jimmy, I got your CD  We met one  When we did Tough Crowd  You gave me your CD  Did I?  Fucking awesome  Great CD  Oh, thanks, Jim  You're killing me on the show, too  Really making me laugh  All the time 
[03:37:30]  I'm howling  That fucking Tony Danza thing you do  Oh, my God  Anthony, that's you, right?  Thank you  Yeah  Dude, that is fucking phenomenal  They're on to us, though, unfortunately  I know  They have security out there  So we can't really do it anymore  But we'll figure something out  You can set up a kiosk in the mall  You know, win tickets to see Tony  And have Tony on the phone there  Hey, did you hear the one where  He actually got the girl on the phone  And he said that  You're going to come backstage  And suck my cock  It's uncomfortable 
[03:38:00]  You know, I'm listening to them like  No  Oh, I know  You don't want it to go there  But you know exactly where it's going  Yeah, like you can't sit still  When you're listening  But you can't turn away  It was fucking awesome  And a dead-on impression, too  Thanks, Joe  Impression's spooky  You know, it's like, whoa  Hey, is that weather affecting you out there?  No, not me  No?  You're cool  You don't have a house on a ledge somewhere?  I was in Orlando  Oh, really?  People are dying out here  Yeah  Houses are falling on them and shit  I thought maybe you'd need a jacket coat or something  Oh  But you do  That was one of the funniest episodes of that show I've ever seen, by the way 
[03:38:30]  You ever see the Just Shoot Me that he was on?  No, no  He played the biggest idiot  You play stupid really well, Joe  Thank you  Well, because I've been stupid many times in my life  I draw upon my experience  It was  I know  It was one of those shows  I don't think  Did a lot of people watch that?  Just Shoot Me?  Yeah  They did okay  I don't know  It was a fun show  Was that a recurring or not?  I only did it once  You only did it once?  Yeah, that was really funny  Hey, Paulie, the trucker 
[03:39:00]  He says, ask Rogan about the girl losing her shirt on your show  Girl losing her shirt?  Yeah, I guess on Fear Factor, maybe?  Oh, yeah, yeah  It was probably the Thanksgiving episode he was talking about  A chick was swimming around under a boat  And her tits popped out  She just kept going  Did you have these?  So she kept going  With her tits blowing around  When we aired it on TV  We had to pixelate it  Yeah, the famous pixelation thing  Yeah, we did one episode once  Where they had to be totally naked  Where the people had to do a naked thing down a runway  You'd be amazed at how many people complained about that 
[03:39:30]  Really?  Oh, yeah  We got in so much trouble  We got in a lot of trouble  Like, we can never air nudity again  Even if you black it out  And pixelate it  You can never  You know, the fact that they were in front of an audience  Was disgusting to people  What is it with people and nudity?  People in this country freak out at nudity  We can put anything else on a TV screen  And people will be fine with it  Bloated, dead children's bodies are fine  The second you get nude  This country freaks 
[03:40:00]  Well, it's all about religion  I mean, that's the root of it all  I mean, people for some reason still think  That the human body is naughty  You know, that you're not supposed to  I mean, it's  When you were a little kid  Remember when you were a little kid  You figured, one day I'm going to be an adult  And this law makes sense  Yeah  And then one day you become an adult  And you're like, holy shit  Wait a minute  There are no real adults  Nobody knows who the fuck is  He's always watching us  There's no one looking over us  That is a great point  We're not fucking adults  We're the adults now  And yet we still get sucked into it 
[03:40:30]  And I blame people with kids  Yep  God, that's so funny  You keep waiting to get older  And hit that point where you're an adult  But it never really happens  People  There's no adults  It's fake  There's no adults  And there's no one watching  Like, we always think  Oh, you know, this is bad  I shouldn't do this  Fuck, you should do whatever you want  No one's watching  There's no one looking over your shoulder  It's fake  God damn, that is great  That is totally dead on  It's true  There are no adults  We are the adults now  We're it 
[03:41:00]  As fucking insane as it is  The shit that you like  Other people think there's something wrong with it  Like, if you say the wrong words  Or if you're into, you know, having fun with your body  You know, people think there's something wrong with it  Yeah  It's just amazing  And it all boils down to people being scared and religion  You know, that's at the root of it  Yeah, that's definitely what it boils down to  A bunch of freaks, man  You'd be surprised, Joe  How many judgmental people don't like a fellow to receive oral treats  From a member of the transgendered community  Even here  It's fun for everyone and it's good for the economy  You're moving money around 
[03:41:30]  Absolutely  We had some trannies on the man show  When I hosted the man show that would trick you  Everybody says I would never get tricked by a tranny  I say, fuck you  You can get tricked  Easy  Really?  Oh, yeah  Because I'm from the school of not getting tricked  No, we did it on the website  And we got tricked a few times  Well, Jimmy, I think you might have a message girl  Her name is Vanity or something like that  Oh, Vanity is the one  Yes  Steve met her in Vegas  And we had her  She is the most convincing one  Oh, she looks like a chick 
[03:42:00]  She has hips  Her waist comes in narrow  She's got a big ass  Big fake tits  And a little wrinkled, shriveled up black dick  Yeah  It looks like a bonobo monkey cock  She's got between her legs  It's so disgusting  She did an episode of the man show  And we had this guy sitting in the  It was  The show was called Make Me Hard  It was like a little game show that we did  And we had different things in front of a person  We had a little box on their dick with a light on it  And, you know, we would control the box 
[03:42:30]  And we would decide when they got a boner  So, you know, we have, like, strippers dancing for them  Like a midget eating banana  Shit like that  And then we have this tranny  And she looks so hot  And she's gyrating in front of them  And the guy's, like, getting into it  He's feeling her tits  And then she pulls out that little black dick  It's like  It looks like it's just a dick that's been poisoned  She's been pumping, like, female hormones into her body  For, like, a decade  You know, so she still has a cock  But it's just drowned 
[03:43:00]  It's like a drowned dick  But she looks like a girl  They didn't believe how you can be fooled by someone like Vanity  And I told them  You don't understand how much this looks like a chick  She looks like a chick  I mean, right down to the dick  Everything up into her body looks like a chick  Except for the dick  Hey, Joe, we're kind of running out of time here  But I've got to ask you  How drunk is Doug Stanhope on that Girls Gone Wild video thing he hosts?  He's always drunk  He's drunk today  Is he?  When you talk to him right now, he's drunk 
[03:43:30]  That commercial I saw  It comes on and I'm like  Oh my God, he's hammered out of his mind  He gets just sloshed  He loves to get drunk  He's filming another one right now  He's in Puerto Vallarta  He's filming another one  Jesus Christ  Doug drinks to the point where you actually get scared for him  Really?  Yeah, he's a hardcore Alky man  I love Stanhope  I love him  Doug and I  Doug was over at my house once  And we did DMT  You know what DMT is?  DMT, no  It's called dimethyltryptamine  It's the most potent psychedelic known to man 
[03:44:00]  It's the most bizarre thing ever  You take it, it's like a rocket ship to the center of the universe  It's so bizarre  It makes you feel like you're connected with everything  It destroys your ego entirely  Like you don't mind if you live or die  It gives you the most bizarre psychotic experience  Not psychotic  Psychedelic experience you could ever possibly imagine  Like if you've ever done mushrooms  Yeah  Think about mushrooms times a million  Wow  And that's what it is  And so we did this over at my house once  And Doug, when he took it 
[03:44:30]  Like he doesn't have a healthy body  You know?  Yeah  One of the funniest fucking guys I've ever met in my life  The guy's awesome  He's one of my best friends  I love him  But he's been dumping shit into his body  Just chemicals constantly  Since like birth  You know?  And he probably started with soda pop  And now today every day  It's like cigarettes  And alcohol  And he never exercises  And so he takes this  And he's sitting on my couch  And he's making these crazy moaning noises  Because it lasts like 
[03:45:00]  Only like seven or eight minutes  It's a short experience  But it's the most profound experience you'll ever have  And during the seven or eight minutes  Doug is making these moaning noises  And his body's twitching  I'm out of here </pre>
