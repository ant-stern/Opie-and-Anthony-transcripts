<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a chaotic soundbite before the hosts launched into their introduction, boasting their pioneering status on XM Satellite Radio.  The broadcast was punctuated by the unexpectedly viral children's song, "Banana Phone," played in its original Raffi version and a death metal remix.  The show's focus quickly shifted to Noah, a newly hired intern whose extravagant outfit – a fedora, white velvet jacket, Gucci loafers, and Burberry scarf – totaling over $1000, sparked considerable amusement and speculation about his style and sexuality.  His self-composed song, "Julia," was played on air to overwhelmingly negative listener response.  The hosts then dissected bad performances from the previous night’s American Idol, deploying comedic commentary.

The show continued with comedic bits and discussions, including crude jokes about an overweight singing competition contestant, Matthew Miller, and a sexually explicit performance of a Stephen Lynch song about a hermaphrodite. A caller recounted their childhood trauma involving their parents' volatile relationship using expletives.  The hosts discussed the impact of the Janet Jackson Super Bowl incident on advertising, mentioning pulled commercials including one featuring a lustful clergyman and a hoax Volkswagen commercial depicting a suicide bombing.

A substantial portion featured a "test" for intern Noah, where he read aloud sexually explicit excerpts from a Penthouse Forum letter and the gay erotic novel *Rent Boys*, punctuated by sexually suggestive comments and crude jokes from the hosts about Noah's sexuality and his scarf. The imaginary friend of another intern, Steve, named Ramone, was also a recurring topic. The hosts announced their upcoming New Orleans broadcast, mentioned guests Jay London (a singer of "dirty songs") and two Sports Illustrated models, and addressed a listener ("D-Boy") criticizing their treatment of Noah, comparing the interns to *Star Trek*'s "red shirts." This led to a discussion of the listener's childhood sexual abuse. The show concluded with a discussion of a plane crash where, miraculously, no one died.

A listener's agitated call, possibly related to a perceived scam involving Noah, opened the next segment. The hosts shifted to their chronic guest no-show problem, lamenting the absence of the Sports Illustrated models and the lateness of Jay London,  with expletive-laden complaints about staff member Poe’s guest check-in process.  A significant portion focused on Steve and his imaginary friend, Ramon, with audio promos featuring Ramon played. Jay London, a comedian from *Last Comic Standing*, finally arrived with singer Jessica.  They discussed Jay London's career and personal life, before he performed a stand-up set for the studio audience. Jessica performed her song "My Nipples Are the Clits of My Tits."  The segment concluded with discussion about office renovations and planned employee dismissals.

Stand-up performances by Jay London, Jessica Delfino (whose performance of a breakup song about oral sex was cut short), and Colby (whose jokes targeted sensitive topics) opened this segment.  Jessica introduced her band, "Haunted Pussy," before they were interrupted and "Banana Phone" was played again.  Jim Norton made a surprise appearance, telling a joke.  An intern’s soundbite followed, based on an injured reporter’s audio.  A lengthy call with Henry Rollins dominated the latter part of the segment, covering his upcoming Trans-Siberian Railway trip, Iraq experiences with the USO, views on the Iraq War, spoken-word performances, and opinions on various comedians. The hosts also discussed upcoming guests (Club Soda Kenny and a Crazy Horse Cabaret appearance), their in-house comedy club's success, George W. Bush's State of the Union address and made various comedic observations.

The final segment concentrated on the hosts' reaction to President Bush's State of the Union address, playing clips overlaid with music for comedic effect, particularly focusing on his comments on Social Security reform.  Anthony offered a darkly humorous solution involving euthanasia. A listener-submitted audio clip of unintelligible backwards-talking was played, followed by discussion of a previously aired farting sound effect.  The broadcast ended with a plug for Jay London's performance at Caroline's and further off-color humor.

[00:10:00]  Just one of those horrific, like, reservoir dog cutting off the ear  I was thinking, like, the Steelers wheel music  Like, that music just conjures up horrid images  I was thinking, like, the opening scene to Silence of the Lambs  Something like that  Yeah, in the van  Yeah  Would you  Instead of that time  Ring, ring, ring, banana phone  Oh  Ping, pong, ping, pong  Banana phone  Oh  It puts the phone in the cradle  It does this when it's told  Would you

It was not in my head  I couldn't  I swear I could not remember that song  Wow, what powers you have  I was going to say  You're one of the lucky ones  You're like Superman  It'll hit me eventually  But it just didn't hit me last night  I was like, who's that song?  Oh, you think we played it a lot yesterday  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho  And then  And then  Finally  There is now a heavy metal version  There's like a death metal version of this 
[00:12:00]  Who did this?  Yeah, I shouldn't call it heavy metal  It's death metal  You're right  It's got some heavy metal moments though  It's more death metal  You're right  It's a little high screamy thing  Yeah, but  It's taken on a life of its own  Listen to this version  I've got this feeling  So appealing  For us to get together 
[00:12:30]  For us to get together  I don't think it's where I fall.  There's no pologe, it ain't a party. 
[00:13:00]  My cellular, my cellular phone.  Don't be good, it's don't be time.  You're gone, I'm a friend of mine.  Don't be so pure, I see me.  So I'm a real good time.  I'll tell the pizza, I'll tell my chat.  I'll tell who I am, I'll tell the girl.  I'm around the world, I've already kept me crazy.  Ah, yeah, the obligatory guitar solo. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, well, you get the idea, the death metal slash heavy metal version of banana phone, Anthony.  Sure isn't as cute when they do it.  All the interns in the other room are now rolling their eyes, Anthony,  as Noah brings you your food for the morning.  Look, I'm going to take my banana, look.  Hello? Hello?  Hello?  Oh, look.  Hey, how you doing?  Yeah, you better run out of the studio.  You better run out of the studio.  Oh, my goodness.  Did you see him today?  I wouldn't acknowledge him because he forgot my apple. 
[00:14:00]  He forgot your apple?  Yeah.  You want to talk to him about it?  Maybe he should spend more time concentrating on your order than concentrating on the outfit he's going to wear today.  Maybe we've got to play apple phone.  Ha ha, ring, ring, ring, ring, apple phone.  Is he going out to get the apple?  Of course she is.  She is.  Oh, man.  I asked Ben flat out today.  I'm like, what were you thinking?  I really think him or Steve or both should be fired at this point. 
[00:14:30]  Someone's got to go.  Because they interviewed Noah.  Yeah.  It's a freak show now.  They're saying he wasn't like this when they interviewed him.  He came in in a suit.  Well, get Steve and get Ben in here.  All right, please.  So now one of the things that are going around is that he's doing an act.  You know?  No.  I'll tell you why.  Which would really suck because we'd just have to throw him off the show.  Right.  Hand on the hips and stuff like that.  Certain things might be like the get-ups.  I think the get-ups, like he's trying a little too hard. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, believe me, that's no act.  The hands on the hips and the way he takes his jacket off to show you his back.  Where's Ben?  Because he's the only one that knows what he's wearing.  Ben looked him up and down first thing this morning.  Because I guess Ben really needs to be in here for this.  Just because Noah beat Ben into the office today.  And he's wearing...  I can't even explain what he's wearing.  He's got like Bono-type sunglasses on.  He's got like a...  What kind of hat is that?  It's a fedora.  Like a fedora. 
[00:15:30]  It's sort of a fedora.  He's got like a white...  It looks almost like a white velvet jacket.  He's got like Gucci loafers on.  He's got a scarf that's making him look like Charles Nelson Reilly.  Amber sunglasses.  Call up Ben on the banana phone.  Herky, jerky, herky, jerky, banana phone.  Hey, Ben.  Actually, Noah's dressed like the keep on trucking thing with that stupid hat and jacket.  He should be swinging like some people are watching from you.  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Ben. 
[00:16:00]  It's, it's Ben.  Hurricane Ben.  It's, it's, it's Ben.  So what's going on with Noah today?  First of all, he beat Steve and I to the office, which is a little scary because we get paid.  He doesn't even get paid.  But when I walked in and saw his outfit, I was like, what the...  You know.  What is he wearing?  He's got...  He was semi-normal on his interview.  I mean, he had his suit on, but he didn't talk this way.  I think it's all an act.  I've come to that conclusion. 
[00:16:30]  Really?  Yeah, because he, in his interview, he was great.  He's like, had all these ideas, show prep.  Maybe he knows that that's what it takes to get the job.  And then he goes back into what he actually is when he shows up.  I don't know.  And we don't know what that is yet.  And we don't know what that is.  I'm waiting for him to come in with an ascot.  He's a second away from an ascot.  He's wearing the scarf.  He's got a scarf.  He's wearing the white velveteen blazer. 
[00:17:00]  It's ridiculous.  He's an intern for a bunch of dudes, man.  You walk in here and instantly you look at him and go, what the hell is that?  Like, what is that person thinking?  He looks like he's backstage at a play waiting to go on.  Like, that's not something people wear.  It's a costume that someone would wear in the wings waiting to walk out on stage and  go, I'm here, darling.  I'm home, darling.  Been in Europe for a while with the dopey hat. 
[00:17:30]  Take it off.  Do that lunging walk to the hat rack.  Give me a kiss.  All he needs is the cigarette with the cigarette holder.  Cigarette holder.  Bingo.  Look at this.  He's got Gucci loafers on.  I mean, those are white velveteen blazer and a black shirt.  He's got Gucci loafers on.  He's got his pants are too long.  He's got the ridiculous sports shirt.  I mean, it's just like...  Good morning, Noah.  I think the kid looks sharp.  He looks sharp.  Noah is...  Noah, do you mind if we take your hat off so we can put headphones on you? 
[00:18:00]  Jesus.  That is some hat.  That is a good hat.  Thank you.  So what's going on with you, Noah?  Are you trying to get attention because you got it?  Not at all.  You don't dress like this.  No one dresses like this.  This is what everybody thinks is that I'm trying to get attention, but I really swear  that this is the way I dress every day to school.  Every day you go to school like that.  Every day.  And people don't make fun of you.  You totally don't believe me, but I really do.  Do they point?  Dude, come on.  Dude, you know you're inside now.  Why do you need the scarf?  All the interns are making their way in. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, boy.  The interns that don't really get much attention whatsoever, Anthony.  Anthony's wound up in his old navy sweatshirt that I wear every day, pretty much.  Where's your Gucci loafers, Danny?  Sorry.  Nike sneakers will have to do that.  Hey, if you want attention, maybe you two should steal a hat off of Jack Klugman's body.  That is.  That is what they call a Rex Harrison hat.  Rex Harrison reference.  The Rex Harrison hat.  See, Ben Toy doesn't believe me that I wear a dress like this to school. 
[00:19:00]  Dude, you're getting more and more flamier.  Dude, you are what they call flamboyant.  Yeah, Liberace over there.  You know, it's like, I live downtown.  You're so full of crap.  This is totally an act.  That's true.  Have you ever walked to the campus at NYU?  Yeah, I live in the NYU area.  You are so full.  First of all, why would you come in earlier than Steve and I?  I don't even get that one.  You couldn't sleep.  I couldn't sleep last night either.  I still didn't come in.  You beat me in here.  I can't even believe that. 
[00:19:30]  For what?  And then I walked by.  He's got these bad bono glasses on.  Yellow tinted.  They're like amber tinted.  I would think, is it coming in early, being a good intern?  I mean...  I'll say it is.  There you go.  But now you're inside, so why are you going to continue wearing the scarf and the sunglasses?  Well, it just came from outside, so I'll take it.  No, no, no.  You walked around from five to six with the scarf on.  That is true.  When I walked in, you had the scarf on.  You're walking around.  You had the scarf on.  It's a...  Are you going to fight the Red Baron? 
[00:20:00]  It's some kind of plaid, like a kilt scarf.  What the...  Little brown, black and white, and red stripes on it, like a...  It's the Burberry scarf.  It's the...  It's the Burberry?  Jesus Christ.  It's a what?  It's Burberry.  Dude, you just look like an ass.  Burberry.  I mean, I know what that is, so you can rag on me, but nobody else knows what that is.  Ben, what's a Burberry?  Burberry.  I know it.  It's a brand name.  I don't like the fact that Ben knows it.  We're all retards.  I know, Ben.  No one else knows. 
[00:20:30]  I'm fashion conscious.  I don't mean...  Wait, you mean Burberry's clothes?  We know what it is.  Shut up, Jim.  I didn't know.  And now the black shirt underneath.  Is that anything we should know about?  No.  It's a plain black shirt.  It's just a plain black shirt.  It's a plain black shirt.  Yeah.  And the jeans...  By the way, that sport coat is corduroy.  It's corduroy?  He's right.  Big surprise.  He's right.  That's corduroy?  Yes.  Who's the maker of the sports jacket?  It's an H&M jacket.  Okay.  All right.  So...  All right.  And what are the jeans that are too long?  That's a couple of O's out of those. 
[00:21:00]  There's seven jeans.  Oh.  Isn't seven jeans what girls wear?  What jeans?  Seven.  I've heard of seven jeans.  I don't even know seven jeans.  Seven jeans are like all the rage these days with women.  With the chicks?  Well, I hate to tell you...  How much are those jeans?  They're well over $100 a pair now or something like that.  About $140.  Yeah, $140 for a pair of jeans.  $140 jeans.  This is a girls thing that's going on.  Girls all are saving up their money, teenagers and the like, to get a pair of seven jeans.  Let me tell you something.  I don't know one guy that wears seven jeans. 
[00:21:30]  Dude, yeah, exactly.  I worked for a record company.  I met Robert Plant.  Oh, yeah.  And he ordered a pair of seven jeans.  Robert Plant.  So...  Yeah, he's Robert Plant.  Dude, still, he's my idol.  He has every right.  He recorded Led Zeppelin IV.  Right.  Better know that.  You're a Zosso.  Yeah, no, you've really, I mean, I...  The singer of Led Zeppelin can wear and pay for whatever he damn well pleases.  Singers of bands like Zeppelin and the Stones could have that, is he gay, is he straight  thing going on and no one cares.  Yeah, he thinks he's Mick Jagger over there. 
[00:22:00]  He's got the whole, like, you know, Studio 54 Mick look on.  What, a stomach full of jizz?  And what about the...  And then what about the loafers?  Loafers?  What are they?  Yeah, and...  They're right here.  Gucci.  Those are definitely Gucci.  Gucci loafers?  Yeah.  And, Noah, you know, if you're going to have the expensive shoes, you should at least  get the jeans fitted.  I mean...  Well, most of my shoes are fitted.  They're too long.  Let's see the shoes.  Yeah.  What do we got there?  Loafers with the little snaffle bit across the front.  Very nice.  Very nice. 
[00:22:30]  What do those go for?  420.  420 bucks.  What kind of shoes are they?  Gucci.  They're Gucci.  Right, yeah.  So, Daddy just...  500.  Daddy just buys all this stuff for you?  Yeah.  Ugh.  Do you say, Daddy, I want to go shopping, or does he buy you this stuff, or do you just  go...  Does he ask to see it?  No.  I go shopping myself, and...  You got a credit card?  Yeah.  And he pays.  And he pays.  And he pays.  Are you Daddy's big disappointment, or he doesn't really care?  Not at all.  I'm just asking.  I don't know.  My dad's quite proud of me, actually. 
[00:23:00]  Any brothers?  Yes, I have an older brother.  I remember coming home from college, and I came home with an earring in my left ear,  and my dad lost his effing mind and said, take that earring out of your ear while you're  living in this house.  And it was a lousy earring.  And what about the one in my schlong, Pop?  Yeah, right?  And it was...  And at the time, it was something everybody was doing, so it wasn't even, like, out of  the norm.  I can't imagine walking in and having my dad see me like this.  Hi, Dad.  Do you walk in to greet your father just like that? 
[00:23:30]  My parents do not care.  Last year, I had four piercings up both ears.  I got rid of them.  Wait, let me ask you.  My parents didn't care.  Wait, Veruca.  Let me ask you.  How much is the scarf?  The scarf?  Uh, $250.  Wait, wait.  That's a $250 scarf, and Ben is going up.  He's going higher.  Like, what, three bills?  Yeah, he's throwing lower numbers than what his stuff's worth.  How much is it worth, Ben?  How much is it worth, Ben?  I'm pretty honest.  The Gucci shoes, $500. 
[00:24:00]  Gucci sunglasses, $300.  Someone had all this up.  I mean, he's got, I'm very surprised you would have an H&M jacket on, because that would  be seen as like, ooh, not...  Well, I mix it up.  How much is the H&M jacket?  It's cheap.  It's like $60.  Yeah.  Wow.  So, but his outfit is over $1,000 easily.  It's ridiculous.  Do you know that all my clothes, if I added them up, would maybe amount to $2,000?  That's if you threw your furniture in, too.  I know. 
[00:24:30]  If I go shopping...  I'm not even kidding, dude.  Know how many...  With a thousand bucks.  Know how many different things I can wear before it adds up to $2,000?  If I go out with a couple of grand to go shopping for clothes, I will have clothes for the year.  Like, it will just be that easy.  I will have so much clothing in my closet to wear on a daily basis.  For him, it's one day.  Yeah, if you go out with a couple grand to go shopping, the woman is going to be the most  of the clothes.  Come on.  Right.  You know, no, it's just... 
[00:25:00]  First of all, he's the woman.  He's the woman.  He's the woman over this whole...  Yeah, because how did he get through the cracks?  I don't know.  Look at...  I mean, we did well in the past.  Ben, you know what rule we have.  Well, you said when you interviewed me, I was more conservative.  I was wearing that same three-piece pinstripe suit in my interview, so...  I got to hand it to him.  Everyone knows his name.  The tall intern that's been here four months has something to say.  Yes, sir.  I was just about to say, that outfit is so annoying, because it's so ridiculous, and 
[00:25:30]  it gets you so much goddamn airtime, it makes me want to punch you.  Well, hold on.  Thank you.  Let's ask a little shorter than tall person.  How do you feel?  Yeah, I forgot his name, too.  I don't know your name, but how do you feel?  No, listen to what this guy...  What's your name again?  What's your name?  My name is Danny.  Hi, Danny.  Hey, Danny.  Hi, Nathaniel.  Funny, so...  Nathaniel and hi, Danny.  Well, to be fair, that scarf came free with a bottle of poppers, I think, so...  Oh!  Oh!  Wow.  Are you into poppers, Noah?  I don't even understand the reference. 
[00:26:00]  No.  No, he doesn't do drugs.  No, he doesn't.  You're straight edge?  Well, not straight, but are you edge?  No, I don't do drugs.  Crystal meth.  Wow, man.  All right, well...  That is something.  You guys are going to have to do something to get more attention around here.  Nathaniel, I'm thinking you should come in as a cross-dresser.  That could be your thing.  Sweet.  Just start cross-dressing, and you'll get a lot of air time like Noah.  I was hoping maybe my comedic abilities might get me...  Stop it. 
[00:26:30]  No, no, not at all.  You're talking about something like talent?  Right.  Stop it.  Well, can I have any justification at all?  I mean, I do consider myself an artist a little bit.  I do...  Shut up.  Shut up.  No, I...  He does.  The artist?  No, no.  I do sing, and I do act, and so...  What have you acted in?  I've acted in different plays.  I acted in school.  Besides 20 years of telling your father, like, yeah, I have a girlfriend.  Unconvincingly. 
[00:27:00]  Wow.  I see nothing wrong with...  Yeah, what plays have you been in?  What plays have I been in?  I've been in Bye Bye Birdie.  I did Bye Bye Birdie.  What role did you play?  What role did I play in Bye Bye...  I was the father.  All right.  And what else?  Anything else?  I was in Oliver.  Oliver.  That wasn't a play.  He just met a guy named Oliver.  I was in Oliver.  Never mind.  I actually had to...  Oh, okay.  I think there's nothing wrong, especially in New York City, with dressing to stand out. 
[00:27:30]  Like, I don't like to blend in.  I mean, that's just the way I am.  I don't...  You know.  After him and his boyfriend finished again, he went,  Please, sir, can I have some more?  Oh, okay.  Muttsy Fagan.  I'm all for the New York and you wanted it, but dude, it's so over the top, it's ridiculous.  I mean, it really is.  I don't know, Ben, the kid gets here nice and early.  I think he's vying for a producer job.  I like the fact that this kid's motivated.  Well, we found your band profile online. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  You have a band?  At Garage...  No, no, no.  Just an artist.  Hold on.  GarageBand.com.  Yeah, that's right.  It's...  Can we say your last name?  Rather not.  All right, it's Noah somebody.  No, that's not his name.  Actually, you can say that.  That's my...  That's your stage name?  That's what I mean.  That's my middle name.  Yeah, you can say that.  All right, Noah Ross.  Yeah, that's it.  Noah Ross.  And your profile reads...  I got to tell you, the picture doesn't look anything like what I'm looking at right  now, which goes with Ben's theory that this may be an act that's going on here. 
[00:28:30]  It's a total act.  You...  I've got...  Yeah, I've...  Come on.  I was wearing a t-shirt in that picture, and I was trying to look like Rockstar for  GarageBand, so that was...  Rockstar?  That was totally posed for that.  All right, well, it says, I hail from...  I hail from big city New York.  But you're from Philly.  Yeah, but I've been here for the last four years.  Everyone loves saying they're from New York when you're trying to make it.  And I've been singing since I was six. 
[00:29:00]  To me, there's nothing more exciting in the world than to get up on stage and put on a  knockout performance.  I was classically trained for four years.  However, I have strayed a bit from the rules and boundaries of opera music.  Somehow I got swept away by a love for soul.  Listening to Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, and Robert Plant made me rethink where I would  take my voice.  I love radio pop music, but it's gotta have soul. 
[00:29:30]  If the singer doesn't feel it, how are his listeners?  That's a little odd way to put things.  If the singer doesn't feel it, how are the listeners to feel it?  Right.  Music is my life, and I am constantly writing music lyrics and working in my home studio.  And that's it.  Influenced by Led Zeppelin, Michael Jackson, Queen. 
[00:30:00]  George Michael.  Peter Gabriel.  You too.  Yep.  Queen.  Queen.  There's nothing wrong with Queen.  One of the greatest fans of all time.  I agree with that.  Not going to get an argument from me.  Not one of the greatest, but they were good.  They were right up there, buddy boy.  Ozzy, didn't they?  Yeah, they're no Ozzy.  Ozzy didn't have any.  A couple of songs that made them popular.  They were a little overrated.  A couple of songs overrated.  Yeah, just a couple.  Yeah.  Yeah, Brian May, he stinks, right, Jim?  No, he's good, but they're overrated.  Shots are overrated.  They were.  All right, well, you want to listen to Noah's song? 
[00:30:30]  I would absolutely love to.  How is this done?  Oh, he's saying, oh, no.  This is what you've been waiting for, so we're going to get it over with, so we can move on with  our radio show.  Now, music.  And you have taken over.  Where'd the music come from?  Where'd the music come from?  Over the summer, I was working at a record company, and I met some producer.  Yeah, I'm sure you did.  From some Swedish producer.  Ooh.  He was blonde and hairless.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Nice bubble bath filled with marmalade and scented oils.  He was much older than me in LA.  Yes, he was.  Of course he was. 
[00:31:00]  He taught you.  I'm going to teach you a thing or two.  So I auditioned, and we produced a song together, and that was about it.  But he put the tracks together?  Yeah, he put the tracks together.  And you wrote lyrics to this?  I just wrote the lyrics, yeah.  And performed it to his music?  That's right.  This is you singing?  That's me singing.  What's the name of the song?  It's called Julia.  Julia.  Mm-hmm.  Isn't that the name of the girl you had sex with?  It's actually, how come the end got dropped off the end?  All right. 
[00:31:30]  It's about Downey and less than zero.  It's not an option.  All right.  All right, yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, lucky me.  I got you with me on the street.  Strolling down Third Avenue.  The other dresser.  Wanna put up a fight. 
[00:32:00]  You're a wildcat out of the zoo.  Shame on my boy.  It's mine.  Can't contain it.  You're just my kind.  Choo-choo-choo-choo.  Julia.  You're uncontrollable.  Whoa.  Got me cornered on the floor.  Got me crying out for my world.  Oh.  Turned like your tree for a pathetic boy like me. 
[00:32:30]  To a trap.  Honey so sweet.  Twice my size.  Girl, you hypnotized me.  Literally knocked me off my feet.  Shame on my boy.  It's mine.  Can't contain it.  You're just my kind.  Choo-choo-choo.  Julia.  You're uncontrollable.  Whoa. 
[00:33:00]  Got me cornered on the floor.  Got me crying out for my world.  Choo-choo-choo.  Julia.  You're uncontrollable.  Whoa.  Got me cornered on the floor.  I got me crying out for my world.  Come on now.  Julia.  Julia. 
[00:33:30]  Julia.  Julia.  Shame on my boy.  It's mine.  My boy, it's mine.  I can't contain it.  You're just my kind.  Choo-choo-choo.  Julia.  You're uncontrollable.  Whoa.  Got me cornered on the floor.  Got me crying out for my world.  Choo-choo-choo. 
[00:34:00]  Julia.  Three simple words.  I am gay.  That's Noah, our intern, and his song, Julia.  Gay.  Totally gay.  Liberace gay.  Wow.  Wow.  It's, uh...  Holy Jesus.  Who's men wanted to have sex with me?  Um, well, uh...  I...  God damn it.  Are you fucking with me?  Yeah.  I am speechless.  I am stupefied.  I am speechless. 
[00:34:30]  I...  I, uh...  Um...  The instant feedbacks are flooding in.  Frank, gayest song ever.  Uh...  He sounds like Cher.  Uh...  The singing...  This song makes me want to dance in a ball bag and grab my sack.  The sack of my pool boy.  Wow.  Turn it off. 
[00:35:00]  Noah's latest song, Whole Lotta AIDS.  The people are freaking out over here.  Yeah, they're coming in.  I've never seen feedback come in faster, Anthony.  Wow.  Did Michael Jackson feel up little boys to this song?  Guido writes,  I'd rather pretend to be a person with Down syndrome and strap a bomb to my back than listen to that.  I don't know.  I thought it had a nice ring to it. 
[00:35:30]  It was kind of poppy.  Ring?  His voice sounds like he's in the middle of gay sex.  That really did kind of have a...  A gay sound to it.  So why is Jim here the only one on my side all the time?  Because he's lying, Noah.  He's lying to your face.  No, he's not lying to you.  I actually think it's not a bad song.  Yeah, I mean, if I had to be honest, it's definitely not my cup of tea.  I wouldn't go out and buy something like that.  And if I walked into a room and that was playing, I'd make sure I'd get the hell out of there immediately. 
[00:36:00]  But it's not bad.  It's not bad?  It's poppy.  It's not something I would listen to.  But Noah, your vocals were atrocious.  It was this operatic thing, this affectation on your voice.  You either sing opera or you sing pop.  And you can never put the two together.  There's this operatic, that little tremolo thing you were giving your voice at the end of that. 
[00:36:30]  What about Queen?  What about Freddie Mercury?  That's a good boy.  What about Freddie Mercury?  That's not opera.  The guy has a rock quality to his voice.  It was rock, but he used opera.  It's different.  A lot of people can put the tremolo in their voice without it coming off sounding operatic.  It just, I'm sorry, it had this very gay sound to it.  My radio now smells like ass. 
[00:37:00]  That just came in.  Makes me wish I had my sailor's outfits.  He's the next David Hasselhoff.  Whoever had Spandau Ballet on their iPod is now admonished.  Wow.  Well, I guess they kind of like it.  That song made me just test positive.  Wow.  I truly appreciate the feedback.  It's very nice.  Well, it's about Julia.  Spandau Ballet.  A lot of references to Boy George. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  Julia, kill yourself.  We're getting all of them coming in here.  All right, well.  I don't think the girl I wrote this about actually knows about this song.  I don't think this girl knows you.  Well, I'm going to disagree with that.  Had some sex with her.  Doesn't the girl have to be alive to know about you?  Noah makes Boy George look like a lumberjack.  Sounds like queen. 
[00:38:00]  Drag queen.  So why don't you send a copy of this to Julia?  To Julia?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because it's kind of embarrassing.  Why?  Well, where is Julia these days?  California.  What part?  Stanford.  Niagara Falls.  Stereo Canada.  Did Mario Cantone write that?  I just fingered my own ass for the first time.  Yeah.  Well, okay.  Well, there you have it. 
[00:38:30]  Julia, everyone.  Any more songs?  No, that was it.  Oh, that was it.  That was the first and last of your singing career.  What about acting?  Any more?  You audition for anything?  Not lately.  No?  No.  Noah's song just got played on national radio.  I'd like to remind everybody I'll be at the open mic at the Boston Comedy Club tonight.  Welcome aboard, son.  What's your name again?  I hate you.  Oh, I'm Nathaniel, by the way.  Oh, hi, Nathaniel.  Nathaniel.  Yeah.  When did you start?  A couple weeks ago? 
[00:39:00]  October.  When we started, I'll be.  Oh, all right.  Well, he just doesn't get the attention that Noah gets.  I'm sorry.  I think that cross-dressing thing could work for you as far as getting attention around here.  Sure.  He does a nice job, and so does Donnie, the other guy.  Yeah.  It's Danny.  Oh, Danny.  Sorry, Danny.  All right, Noah.  Go back to doing whatever you do.  Whatever it is you do, dressed like that.  Will do.  All right. 
[00:39:30]  Don't forget your hat.  There it is.  Could you wash my apple, sweetie, please?  Thank you.  It's not washed?  No.  Well, he just came rushed in with a thumbprint in it, too.  He's just holding it, probably.  He was looking at another gentleman on the...  Sweating.  Nervous?  Might have been a helmet print.  Oh!  All right, well, that's...  He just put his hat back on, and I guess Eric's taking pictures.  Someone wants to know if Noah's favorite Zeppelin song is Moby Dick. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, very nice.  All right, we'll play this little thing, and then we'll continue with the program.  Noah.  Admitted homosexual.  It's a bit on the feminine side.  A lot of telltale signs that are questionable about my sexuality.  Right, right.  I have to be honest.  I woke up late.  I didn't take time to pick out my outfit.  So I went to a psychiatrist who told me that I was a woman.  One traps and a man's body.  Do you shave your chest?  Yes, I do.  Do you shave your butt crack, too, so nobody gets chafed?  Yes, I do.  I got a question for Noah.  Are you a Ricky Martin fan? 
[00:40:30]  Yes.  Admitted homosexual.  What celebrity would you have sex with?  God, that's a hard one.  I don't know.  I'd say Jude Law is a good-looking guy.  Jude Law.  Admitted homosexual.  What is it that made you pick him?  He's decent-looking.  I don't see anything wrong with that answer.  Admitted homosexual.  I thought you'd have sex with Jude Law.  Yes.  Jude Law.  So Jude Law, if you had to pick a second choice, but there had to be kissing involved.  I guess...  All right, I guess I would go with Matt Damon, I would say.  Matt Damon.  Brr.  Admitted homosexual.  I just love a drive in the country, laughing with Opie and Anthony. 
[00:41:00]  That plane is flying awfully low, don't you think, Ramon?  Ramon, call 911.  Sam, too, or tell.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Raw! 
[00:41:30]  Are you breathing?  Raw!  Are you breathing?  Now, now, free go.  Are you alive?  Will you listen to me?  I'm gonna talk about the biggest.  Now, someone is gonna die.  Will you listen to me?  This is the big night.  This is the big night.  Hey!  Wake up.  Are you alive?  Will you listen to me?  I'm gonna talk about the biggest.  Now, someone is gonna die.  Will you listen to me?  All right, let's go to the phones and talk to Paul in Connecticut. 
[00:42:00]  Hey, Paul, what's up, buddy?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hi.  You tell us.  Not much.  Hey, how are you, little sizzle chest?  How you doing?  I'm good, thanks.  How are you?  I'm very good.  Hey, you know, this is telling me, please play the banana song.  That song's in my head.  I think my car's possessed.  I'm driving straight, straight to Fire Island.  I don't know why.  My car's automatically going to Fire Island.  Yeah, that Julia song was very interesting from the intern there. 
[00:42:30]  That was nice.  I had a good beat to it.  All right, thank you, Paul.  No problem.  I think he wanted to say he wanted us to play banana phone to get the Julia song out of his head.  What is the power?  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Ah, Doug in Chelsea.  What's up, Doug?  Yes, hi, boys.  How are you?  What's up, Doug?  Nothing.  I have proof that he is gay.  Oh?  Yes.  Well, me and my friends, we all listen to your show. 
[00:43:00]  We just love it.  Let me just start by saying that, sweetie.  Okay?  But the funny thing was we were all together at the party the other day, and we were talking  about, you know, Noah and whether he's gay or not.  And I was like, I think he's gay.  And they were like, yeah, I think so, too.  Not as funny as when Jim does it, but pretty good, bro.  All right.  I have one more, then we've got to move on here.  Let's say hi to John in Jersey.  John, what's up?  Hey, good morning, boys.  Morning.  Listen, Noah's got to give back his copy of Rent, Boys. 
[00:43:30]  The Pittsburgh Public Library is looking for it.  Between February 3rd through 5th, maybe Norton can bring it back to him.  Oh, come on.  Who cares about the improv this weekend?  Thank you, sir.  Well, here is Rent, Boys.  We were thinking of making Noah read from Rent, Boys, but we're thinking that's just too easy.  Yeah, that's not why that was created.  And if you're a new listener to the show, I don't know, should we explain the Rent, Boys?  We're not explaining stuff these days, because we figure people are up to speed, or they're 
[00:44:00]  going on the message boards to find out about this stuff at this point.  It's pretty quick and easy.  Jimmy brought that in as a punishment for the masculine interns.  If they screwed up, they would have to read out of Rent, Boys, which is just a steamy, gay  book with very gay lines that had to be read out of it.  You really think it's steamy?  Steamy, Opie.  I would say that's pretty steamy.  Is that someone else's review, or is that your review?  My review, Anthony says, steamy. 
[00:44:30]  You know what?  Having him read from this might not be a bad idea.  I had highlighted last time, this has been away for three months, but I had highlighted  the next punishment, which I was kind of hoping for Ben or Steve.  You got one highlighted?  It was already highlighted, yeah.  Well, you know what?  I think we need to take this to the next level.  I think he should read from Rent, Boys, but he also should read from Penthouse Forum or  something.  And see what sounds more natural to the listeners.  Exactly.  And then we'll have the listeners.  Fill me in first what Rent, Boys is.  Rent, Boys is a fine novel. 
[00:45:00]  Do you know what Rent, Boys is, Noah?  No, I really don't know, except for the message boards.  That's all I know about it.  It's nothing.  It's just a book.  It's a little cute book that the interns would read from when they were being punished  for a misdeed or something that was done correctly.  You have to ask what Rent, Boys is by, you can see the cover.  Yeah.  Look at the cover.  What do you think that is?  There is a young man on the cover, shirtless, wearing tight jeans, massaging his breasts.  Can you say man again?  Young man.  On the cover of that steamy novel. 
[00:45:30]  Novelette.  Oh.  So I highlighted, as a punishment for Ben, like from right there to right there.  It's a paragraph.  It's not that much.  It'll take you a minute to read.  Wait, did you say a punishment for Ben?  Hold on, though.  We've got to find some kind of steamy other side, too.  Yes.  Tell him the page.  He could probably just read it off the top of his head.  Oh, that one?  I love that verse.  Novelette, why are you sitting down and getting comfortable?  Well, apparently you have to read.  Let's see why you stand up and read.  This kid's always got an answer.  I like it.  Eventually.  Like, leave.  We've got to do a couple other things. 
[00:46:00]  We'll get back to you.  Yeah?  Please?  Sure.  Well, because we don't have the other thing yet, right?  Yeah.  The thing.  The thing.  The other thing.  We don't have any penthouses in the office.  There he goes.  Office?  That's Hustler.  Does Hustler do the letters?  I don't even know.  Did you see the way he spun out of here?  Jimmy saw it.  Yeah.  He grabbed the door and did a pirouette out the door as it shut with one arm kind of up  in the air.  Are we getting his latest outfit on the internet? 
[00:46:30]  All right, good.  You can go to opiananthony.com.  When is he going to come in just wearing the gimp suit from Pulp Fiction?  That would be very appropriate.  Yeah.  The zipper over the mouth.  Oh, wow.  There you go.  Anthony, speaking of singing, you want to go through some of the American Idol from last  night?  Maybe just a couple of the people that stood out?  Time to bring out the Noah.  Noah's sleeping.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[00:47:00]  I'm just kidding, motherfucker.  I'm just kidding, motherfucker.  A drooling Marcellus Wallace getting it in the keister.  Oh, what an awful part.  Yes, Obi?  Well, we were talking about singing, and Noah, I'm surprised he didn't try out for American  Idol.  He's a natural, isn't he?  And we're down to what?  The last of the preliminaries?  Last night they got done with the, yeah, it was the last open audition, and they've picked 
[00:47:30]  everybody that they're going to pick, and then we go to the, they go to Hollywood, where  now you have to perform on the stage, in front of the judges, and they give you things  to do.  And now it really heats up, because some of the people that got through, marginally,  that are so happy that they made it through, get nothing but a big lap full of disappointment.  Okay.  I showed a couple of clips in the previews last night, and I can't wait, because some 
[00:48:00]  of these people just, they kind of stunk, but through sympathy or something, the judges  let them through.  And I just love devastating disappointment.  I love watching people just weeping on their knees, on the floor, outside, backstage.  It's the best part of the show.  All right, we want just to play two of the people that sang last night.  Yeah.  A guy named Victor.  What happened?  What was that?  What was that?  Danny.  The listener's in here, that big cab, what was that?  Danny just came in with Noah's hat on, and he's prancing around. 
[00:48:30]  He's prancing.  Danny is now prancing around with Noah's hat on.  It's no bit with Danny.  Danny wants to beat the crap out of him.  I know.  He's had it with Noah.  He has completely had it.  Really scary.  All right, Victor.  Victor, the angry guy.  Yeah, Victor, I guess, showed up last year and auditioned and was told, you know, he stunk,  because he's awful.  His singing is awful.  And again, he showed up.  He's all cocky. 
[00:49:00]  And, you know, before he goes in there, he looks at the camera and says how good he is  and how he deserves to be on American Idol and how he's a star.  And he gets up there and just stinks on ice, and they tell him how much he stinks, and he gets thrown out.  And he got a little angry.  Why do you build me up?  Buttercup, baby, just to let me down and mess me around.  And then, first of all, you never call, baby, when you say you will.  But I love you still.  I need you more than anyone, Paula. 
[00:49:30]  You know that I have from the start.  So build me up.  And, Brandy, please don't break my heart.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Thank you so much, Victor.  How do you get up on stage, sing like that, and think for a second that you are going to be in?  For a second.  You can't hear yourself.  This is what the judges had to say.  Oh, yeah.  Should we just do this together, you guys, on the count of three?  One, two, three. 
[00:50:00]  No.  Victor, you are a terrible singer.  You are a terrible dancer.  You have no charisma.  Terrible.  I mean, everything.  No charisma?  No.  I've seen some of those people that you sent through there, and I know I'm a lot better  than that.  Oh, dude.  Come on.  I got all the energy.  Victor.  I got a wonderful voice.  Victor, you know what?  It doesn't matter what we think.  You know what?  All that matters is what you think, anyway.  Your voice is terrible.  It's definitely what America thinks.  Victor, America would hate you.  Your voice is terrible, baby.  They would hate you, Victor, honestly. 
[00:50:30]  Vic, man.  Let me tell you one thing.  You don't forget this name, because I'll be back.  Yeah.  I might not be back on this show, but I definitely will.  Victor, if you finish to get a number one record in the next six months, I'll pay you  $50,000.  I'll pay you $100,000.  I'll pay you $100,000.  What about William?  He, uh...  Really?  Come here.  It's a bet.  It's a bet.  I'll definitely bring it on, Simon.  It's a bet.  You don't have to pay me.  I'll pay you.  Because, Victor, you can't sing. 
[00:51:00]  That's fine.  I appreciate that.  I really appreciate your honesty.  We appreciate yours, too.  Oh, Paula's got to be all sympathetic to the person.  He was a real tool.  And you heard that.  Uh, Simon told him he'd give him $50,000, and then Paula, uh, told him, uh, she'd raise  it to $100,000, and so did Randy, $100,000, if he was able to get a number one record in  the next six months, because the guy thinks he's just...  Number one, like, song?  Yeah.  I mean, the odds of that happening, even if you're good, uh, are really slim. 
[00:51:30]  This guy doesn't have a chance, but he got a little confused, I think, as to what, um,  Simon was saying about, uh, the bet that he made.  Right.  Simon bet him, you know, uh, he'd give him $50,000 if he had a number one song in six months.  They're...  That's all I gotta say, a bunch of...  This is...  I can dance.  I...  I can sing.  I just...  Right now, I do not want the cameras in my face.  I'm going...  Right now.  I made a bet this time, man.  He's going to pay me $100,000 if I get a record contract in the next six months. 
[00:52:00]  $100,000.  Well, you know what?  Anybody in America, sign me up.  I'll give you half of the $100,000.  Go.  Yeah, nice offer.  If that had actually been what Simon said.  Victor, if you finish to get a number one record in the next six months, I'll pay you $50,000.  I'll pay you $100,000.  Yeah, I'll pay you $100,000.  And the guy's going around going to eat, uh, a record deal.  Because if I get a record deal in six months, no, you tool.  And, uh, Victor continues here.  I can move around.  I'm not all fat like Ruben.  I'm better looking than Clay. 
[00:52:30]  I definitely think so.  Definitely.  And you know what?  I'm taking Simon's money.  I will get signed in six months, and I will take his money.  Delusional.  Totally.  What an ass.  Every year they get those people that just can't believe that they didn't make it through.  They have no clue why they didn't make it through.  Because you stink.  Some people just don't have talent.  You're one of them.  But I guess that's what makes the show, uh, entertaining. 
[00:53:00]  I actually watched American Idol last night and found myself kind of getting caught up  in it.  See?  You're kidding?  Nah, because I was too tired.  I had to cancel the show.  I was too tired.  So I'm like, I'm going to stay home, eat, and maybe watch a little State of the Union and  go to bed.  Yeah, we got to talk about State of the Union a little bit here.  Yeah, I actually enjoyed Simon last night.  I really was annoyed, but I had to be truthful.  I like he's very honest with these people.  I don't think, I think he's doing less of an act now than he was the first couple of  seasons where he was really turning it on.  Now he just sits there, and if somebody sucks, he's just disgusted. 
[00:53:30]  Sits back in his chair, he's like, no.  Awful.  There was one guy, the guy whose brother made it and he didn't.  Yeah.  Who came back, and Randy kind of let him through, and Paula kind of let him, and I think Simon  was the deciding vote.  He was.  And he was kind of looking at him, and he just went, it's a no.  And he was so.  It's a no.  And he goes, look, it's a no.  It was just so quick.  Can I sing another song?  No.  It's a no.  Leave.  The guy's brother made it, and they're twins. 
[00:54:00]  The first audition, they actually went to three different cities to try to audition.  The first one, they were together, did like harmonies and stuff, and they both didn't  make it through.  The second one was in Vegas.  One brother shows up, does well.  They send him through.  So now the last one in San Francisco last night, the other brother shows up, sings, and  they tell him it's a twin brother.  And they tell him, no, your brother's better than you are.  Oh, man.  And he made it through.  You're not making it through.  So that's got to be devastating for a twin brother. 
[00:54:30]  Sure.  All right.  Well, now the showstopper.  Last night was Matthew.  Oh.  This guy comes on very, very effeminate and opens his mouth.  And what came out was a woman's voice, a woman's speaking voice, not even singing.  And then when he started what he called singing, it was just ridiculous.  Here's Matthew.  Hi.  What's your name?  My name's Matthew.  Oh, hi, Matthew.  Hi, Matthew.  Hi. 
[00:55:00]  So why are you here today?  Oh, gosh.  I'm here because it has always been my dream to be a singer.  And you love Kelly.  I love Kelly.  Yes.  Wow.  I adore her.  Wow.  Okay.  Well, what are you going to sing for us today?  The For Your Love by Kelly Clarkson.  Oh.  Oh, cool.  Go for it.  This is a fat dude.  Yeah.  It's a big fat guy.  That's a guy.  That's a fat guy.  Yeah.  Hearing that voice, I'm waiting for him to start singing, Julia.  I'm going to sing Julia.  No, it doesn't even sound like a gay voice. 
[00:55:30]  It was a woman's voice coming out.  It just sounds like a woman's voice.  I was online last night.  One of our listeners IMs me and goes,  Dude, you watch an idol.  I'm like, why?  He goes, just turn it on.  And I got to see this guy.  That was a wreck.  This is unbelievable.  Here's Matthew singing.  I never lived before your love.  This is a guy.  I never fell before your touch.  I never need anyone to make me feel alive. 
[00:56:00]  But then again.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, faggot.  That is a woman's voice.  Did he make it through?  Hell no.  He's actually not a bad singer.  Yeah.  Androgynous, crooning, fat show.  Really?  Just creepy to watch, though.  That voice coming out of that guy.  That goes up on the marquee when he performs.  All right. 
[00:56:30]  Well, here's the judges on Matthew.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I'm jealous of you.  Did anyone ever say to you that you sounded like a woman?  Yes.  I get that in a lot.  Oh, my God.  Yes, I sang at church, and one lady came up to me one time, and she's like, you know,  I was sitting there, and I was closing my eyes, and I just thought, oh, this beautiful  voice, it must be a skinny black woman.  And then I opened my eyes and saw her.  They say you sound like a skinny black woman.  Wow.  Oh, my God. 
[00:57:00]  I don't know what to say, so I don't know what to say either.  Simon, you can say everything on this one.  I feel Matthew has more important decisions to make in his life, because we're not sure  whether it's Matthew or Martha.  You know what I mean?  No.  Is Martha the name of a skinny black woman?  No.  If I was a skinny black woman, I think I'd be like Shikiki or Shikwana.  Shikiki.  Shikwana.  You better where I'm coming from here, Matthew, don't you?  Yes or no to Hollywood?  Absolutely not, I'm afraid, Matthew, but maybe we'll see you in the future. 
[00:57:30]  Paula, a better song that suits you would be picking a male vocalist.  Okay, definitely.  Randy?  I'm really just confused, just like everyone else.  It was a tribute.  Matthew did a tribute.  Yeah, a tribute to Kelly Clarkson.  Thank you so much, Matthew.  You were awesome.  Yeah, I mean, that is a guy.  I can't get over that.  He walked out of there and had to be consoled by some guy.  He was just crying like crazy, and some guy hugs him. 
[00:58:00]  It's wonderful.  A clearly emotional Matthew Miller was consoled by his fellow contestants.  I'm going to be fine.  I'm just hanging in there.  Okay?  Big weepy mess.  And he's fat?  Oh, yeah.  I didn't see him.  He was just...  What did Simon say?  He has more important...  More important decisions to make in life.  Meaning you might want to chop that off.  You might want to lop off that useless piece of meat you pee out of.  You might want to put on a robe and go see your boyfriend who's across the street robbing a bank. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, it's just a big, round, chubby, messy one.  Oh, Jerry, there are a bunch of crazy people over there.  Wow, that's something, huh, guys?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, well...  He didn't make it.  All right.  Next week, they start the process now.  Oh, my God.  I just found something we've got to play after hearing that.  I'm just scanning and it just popped up.  I lucked out on this one.  Oh.  As we go to break, Anthony, a Stephen Lynch song that kind of... 
[00:59:00]  What, what?  You know the one I'm playing?  Yeah.  It's about Matthew.  So Stephen Lynch is here, and you've got a song for Julie, the transvestite pre-sex-op mess?  Mess.  Yeah, I dated somebody like that one.  Okay.  And hermaphrodite is the technical lingo.  Hermaphrodite.  Well, I had a personal experience with one.  You did?  Yeah, I wrote a little song about it.  Okay. 
[00:59:30]  She's part girl, she's part boy.  She's got parts everyone can enjoy.  She's got more, she's got less.  She's got her manhood tucked in her dress.  Yeah.  Is she a mister or is she a miss? 
[01:00:00]  Does she stand up when she's taking a piss?  She's my little girl, she's my little guy.  When I try to please her, I get poked in the eye.  She wears lace and she wears flannel.  She watches football and the Lifetime Channel.  What's that bulge under her nightie? 
[01:00:30]  It's just not hermaphrodite.  Yeah.  Hermaphrodite.  Some things are white, some things are black.  Some girls wear makeup, mine shaves her back.  She is still beautiful, she is still fine.  It's too bad her package is bigger than mine.  She looks like Cher, but she's built like Sonny. 
[01:01:00]  She loves Brad Pitt and finds the Three Stooges funny.  Who's that girl with the grip so mighty?  It's just my hermaphrodite.  Hermaphrodite, hermaphrodite, hermaphrodite.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
[01:01:30]  And then you'd see, like, the old man would take the plate full of spaghetti and throw it, 
[01:02:00]  and it would hit, like, the wall next to the phone.  And you're sitting there horrified, watching the spaghetti slowly go down the wall.  Fuck you! Get the fuck out of this! Oh, fuck you!  Oh, and the horrified kids.  Did dad actually leave after the fights?  Yeah, a lot of times, sure.  And then, you know, you'd be able to go to sleep, because the yelling would stop.  First mom would have to wind down a little.  That fucking asshole!  You know, even after dad left, she's still going.  I need that shit like I need a fucking hole in the head.  I'm trying to sleep. He's gone. 
[01:02:30]  Shut up!  Come sit here and shut up!  That way!  Oh, God, he's been gone a half hour.  When would he come back? The next day?  Yeah, like, the next day.  You know, they'd be sitting down, watching, like, Ronan Martin's laughing.  Laughing, everything was fine.  You know, and then out of nowhere, you'd hear the rumbling.  You'd be in bed, and you'd hear, like...  And then you'd hear from the kids' room.  It's still...  It's a fucking time! 
[01:03:00]  It's a fucking time!  Can't you two just shut the fuck up for, like, one night?  And then we were pretty young, so, you know, we got, you know, called into the room, and  mom sits down and goes,  Me and your father, I want you to know, and I want you to know it has nothing to do with  you, we're divorced.  Oh, okay!  Can I go out and play now?  How's this going to change my life?  Does this mean I don't have to listen to...  Oh, it does?  Okay, so it's a good thing.  Great.  Well, thank you for staying together for so long and really, like, torturing us. 
[01:03:30]  You couldn't have pulled this one, like, five years ago?  Yeah, fucking asshole!  Well, maybe we couldn't remember as much and didn't have to listen to the yelling and screaming?  Don't worry!  Is that the...  Here's an idea, Pop.  There you go.  Right back into the Huntington boat ramp.  Give that a whirl.  The War of the Kumias.  This has got to be...  You're going to just sit there disgusted having to listen to this crap.  XM202.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:04:00]  Hey, just a reminder.  Your pals Opie and Anthony will be on CBS Sunday morning.  They will.  I think it's this Sunday, right?  This Sunday.  Super Bowl Sunday.  With Charles Osgood.  Charles Osgood.  I don't know when.  It'll be on between 9 and 10.30, I believe.  And unfortunately, you will not see Jimmy Norton on CBS Sunday morning, because that was  the day he decided to take off. 
[01:04:30]  And in his place will be Rich Voss on national TV.  Great.  I was in Albany.  Yeah, it was really worth going to Albany, huh?  I miss everything.  Damn.  So check that out.  It should come across pretty well, huh?  Talking about indecency and the Janet Jackson thing, because it's a year later and blah,  blah, blah.  We'll see what they do with it.  Ads are down for the Super Bowl, by the way.  Of course.  I think it has to do with that whole thing.  Of course, because every year people were looking forward to the ads. 
[01:05:00]  There was a, oh my God, what are they going to do this year type of thing.  This is why the government steps in and any kind of art goes out the window.  And people that say that the government isn't stepping on artists' toes is full of it and  delusional.  Because here's what happened.  They made a big fuss about the commercials last year because of the Janet Jackson thing.  It got all lumped in and said that the commercials were offensive, we have to tame them down, 
[01:05:30]  blah, blah, blah.  So, now this year, companies don't want to spend a whole bunch of money on the same cookie  cutter safe commercials.  The only ones people remember are the outrageous ones, the ones that stand out.  The horse farting.  Right, things like that.  Yeah.  Things like that.  The ones that stand out.  And now, because everyone's so scared of government fines, they just, they don't want to make commercials  that are cookie cutter and calm and safe and then spend umpteen million dollars airing 
[01:06:00]  it when no one's going to remember what the hell they're for.  So, there you go.  They're down.  You won't be seeing a lot of the entertaining, fun commercials.  We're not going to see Mickey Rooney's ass.  There's some other ads they already pulled.  Ford is pulling a Super Bowl ad with a lusting clergyman.  What was that ad all about?  Does anyone know?  And a few others they've passed on.  Pablo Picasso said it best, Anthony, when he said, the true enemy of creativity is good 
[01:06:30]  taste.  Yes.  Thank you.  Thank you.  In the advert released to the press this week, a Christian clergyman finds a set of car keys  in the collection plate.  In the church car park, he finds a new Lincoln truck and begins caressing the vehicle, but  stops when a parishioner arrives with his young daughter and explains that the child dropped  the keys in the plate by mistake.  After collecting himself, the clergyman posts his next sermon theme, lust, on the church's  outdoor sign. 
[01:07:00]  The group said, let's see, the group representing U.S. victims of sexual abuse by Roman Catholic  priests urged Lincoln to withdraw the ad.  And the group said, the commercial trivializes childhood sex crimes by trusted clergy.  Because the clergyman is caressing a Lincoln and lusting after the car, they are mad that,  see, this is where we're at. 
[01:07:30]  This is where we are.  Welcome to America.  Here's why I don't mind them yanking it.  Only because if you tried to poke fun at Islam, if you tried to poke fun at Islam, there'd  be an uproar.  I think we should be able to.  I absolutely agree.  I absolutely agree.  I thought that Volkswagen ad that turned out to be a hoax was hysterical.  Which one was that?  It's one of the new Volkswagen cars.  I'm not even sure what the name is.  But it's in Europe somewhere.  And obviously, an Arab Islamic guy is driving this thing, pulls up in front of a crowded 
[01:08:00]  restaurant.  It's got an explosive belt on.  And hits the button.  And it goes, but the whole blast is contained to the inside of the vehicle.  It doesn't blow up the car or anything.  And it's something to the effect of, you know, he's got to pick a better car, you know,  for that purpose.  Something that's going to blow apart.  It's just the car full of smoke.  And everyone at the restaurant doesn't even notice anything happened, you know.  And Volkswagen was outraged that, because they didn't make the ad. 
[01:08:30]  And they started getting all kinds of complaint letters.  How could you put out a commercial like this?  But it turned out a couple of guys just made it, you know, and put it on the web as a  Volkswagen ad.  But, I mean, that's funny.  And would that be offensive if it played in the U.S.?  I don't think so.  It's a little dark, of course, because, you know, it involves terrorism and explosives  and stuff.  But it's that kind of stuff that we just can't see anymore in this country.  Can't see it.  How about an ad for, well, on that, we don't have an ad for, like, minivans where you're 
[01:09:00]  just pulling out of a river and you just pull two little bodies out, throw them in a  bag, and the van starts right up and you drive away.  Starts right up?  Sure.  I like that one.  From Mercury Outboard Motors, when you really just got to start it up and get back home.  The obsession continues.  I thought it was over.  I really thought it was over.  There's plenty of things like that, sure.  All right.  Well, we're going to be on CBS Sunday morning, and we'll give our two cents, Anthony, with  others.  So it should be fun.  I don't know.  I think Donnie Deutsch is going to run our interview sometime. 
[01:09:30]  When's that happening?  Well, he got mad at us because we wouldn't go back and redo our interview, and we just  didn't feel like it because it's not that important to us.  We did a really good interview for Donnie Deutsch, and then what happened?  Michael Powell stepped down, so then our interview was, according to them, outdated, so they  needed us to do it all over again.  And we're like, you know what?  We don't need to go on TV that bad.  It's a big hassle to leave the radio show at 10 and drive to Jersey and wait till like  one to tape and come back. 
[01:10:00]  It's like, you know what?  You either used the one we did or, oh well.  Well, it's like we were saying, you know, we really don't want to talk about the FCC.  We don't want to talk about Michael Powell, blah, blah, blah.  And then CBS Sunday morning shows up, and we talk about the FCC and Michael Powell.  Oh yeah, I guess you're right, huh?  I guess we're hypocrites just like anyone else out there.  Yes, we are.  At least we admit we are.  Okay, a couple things going on here.  Also, don't forget, Monday and Tuesday, we're going to be broadcasting live from New Orleans 
[01:10:30]  at the Crazy Horse on Bourbon Street.  Yeah.  The show is hitting the road again, and that will be on the air 3 to 6 Eastern time.  We're not going to do mornings because, you know, there's no one really drinking.  Well, they are drinking, but not as much as if it was an afternoon radio show.  They're coming off the end of a night drinking at that hour, you know, so they're staggering  to their rooms to go to sleep.  We want to catch everybody right when they start it up and, you know, a few hours into 
[01:11:00]  their beginning of their drinking, and ours.  Yeah, we've got a great location, so if you're a fan of the show and you happen to be down  there, great.  Stop by and say hi, okay?  Hey, that balcony's a little thin, huh?  Is it?  Like it's, well, they're not known for their real wide balconies in New Orleans.  What's that?  Like two to three feet wide.  Like two to three feet wide?  Are you kidding?  Yeah, so we're not going to have, like, chairs and a broadcast table or anything.  We're going to be standing up with headset mics on. 
[01:11:30]  And, you know, the earphones with the headset mic, we're all going to look like Ashley Simpsons  with a little headset strung in front of us.  A little weird.  I kind of like the security of a microphone.  They told us we're going to look like Garth Brooks.  Is that what they said?  Garth Brooks?  Yeah, it's like the older version of that microphone.  Oh, great.  Fantastic.  Well, anything's an improvement over the last time I went to Mardi Gras, and poor Jimmy Norton  looked like Howard Cosell.  Oh, we had the, yeah, I had the Dan Rather from the convention floor. 
[01:12:00]  Wasn't that him?  Yeah, the real big headphones.  On the Democratic National Convention, you had the big headphones with the antennas coming  up off of them.  And the big headset thing slung in front of your face.  Yeah, well, it'll be fun.  There's something to be said for holding a microphone, though.  You get a little more, it's, I don't know, it's a security issue, you know?  Kind of, you get security on stage, right, Jimmy?  Yeah.  Holding the mic.  Yeah, I mean, I prefer it.  A wireless, I did, with a Tonight Show, I'm going to do a wireless, which is a little 
[01:12:30]  odd, because you don't know what to do with your hands.  It's, you know, it's like, what do you do with your hands when you use the mic?  Yeah, that's weird.  When you go on a show like that, yeah, what do they got?  Do they put a clip-on mic on you?  Yeah, wireless.  A wireless.  So then what do you do with your hands when you're used to holding a microphone?  I kind of just, when I wasn't too sure, I just kind of did the Pulp Fiction dance where  I put my two fingers in front of my eyes and waved them back and forth, and I just didn't  That's effective.  I didn't say why I was doing it.  All right, are we ready for Noah?  Yep.  All right, okay, well, what's going on here, Anthony? 
[01:13:00]  We're pretty much going to test Noah?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I think we'll see.  This is an ongoing investigation.  There's no, there's plenty of circumstantial evidence, but no real hard evidence as to  his preferences in life.  But he swears he had a girlfriend, Julia, and he wrote a song about her.  I know.  Sure he does.  You want me to play the song again?  Please no.  Okay.  Please no.  Just to prove that?  No.  You sure?  Positive.  Just a taste?  I don't ever want to hear that again. 
[01:13:30]  I really don't ever want to hear that song again.  Just a little sample.  How's that?  Why would there be any reason for playing that?  Come on, just a little sample.  Because, you know, people are just waking up.  Yeah, exactly.  And maybe they didn't hear Noah's song, so we should just play a little piece of it here,  okay?  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Oh, thank God. 
[01:14:00]  Who didn't see that coming?  That's actually a little tougher than I remember it.  I like it.  All right, where is Noah?  Right here.  Wow, Danny just pushed him really hard.  Danny's pushing him.  It's really getting mad.  Well, we have a paragraph from Rent Boys, which is that steamy gay novelette about boys  and sex and none of those icky women thrown in there.  Yeah, this was something that Jimmy brought to the show.  No surprise there.  Yeah, as a punishment for the manly interns we have. 
[01:14:30]  It's a book called Rent Boys, and when the interns, you know, messed up, we made them read  from this Rent Boys book.  It's funny.  It's really embarrassing, because it's really hardcore gay stuff.  So what am I getting punished for is my question.  Will you shut up until we introduce you?  We're interrupting hope just there.  Oh, yes.  So the book went away for, I don't know, two months, right?  And all of a sudden we're like, hey, where did that Rent Boys book go?  No one wanted to fess up to where it was, because no one wanted anyone else to know they knew  where it was.  So it just disappeared. 
[01:15:00]  It's like, oh, well, it's in my office in the drawer.  So we're all like, eh, I don't know.  Where is it?  Uh, whoever knows where it is, is a homo.  Isn't that that gay book or something?  Right.  It was so funny how no one would even attempt to tell where it was.  It's around here somewhere.  And then everyone may believe they really didn't know and started kicking things around.  Someone found it very quickly.  Yeah, who found it?  Who found it?  It was sitting on top of Jim's desk. 
[01:15:30]  Who found it?  No, it wasn't.  We don't make things up here, Eric.  Where was it?  It was over there somewhere.  No, it wasn't.  It really was on Jim's desk?  Was it on Jim's desk?  Anything that Jim had was sitting on Jim's desk.  It was not on my desk.  It's a faggot.  The one you don't use.  I don't have a desk.  My desk isn't arrived yet.  They had that plastic play school desk that I can't use.  How do you write on a desk when there's little square and round holes in it to put the pegs  in with the plastic hammer?  That awful play school.  Yeah.  And what?  And they put, didn't they put little things on it? 
[01:16:00]  I don't.  Like toys and stuff?  I don't go near it.  Like it was a bit or something they were trying.  Yeah, I don't know what it is.  I know Bruce is ordering me another one.  I don't have a computer or nothing, so I never spend time in the office.  No respect.  That's all right.  I don't even know why you need a desk and a computer.  You're here five minutes before the show starts and you're here maybe ten minutes after the  show ends.  Maybe because he's got to leave right away to get to his computer.  Exactly.  Maybe if I had more time, I would be able to do a little bit of work here.  There you go.  Go on a drudge report.  Yeah.  You know, hey, good idea for tomorrow, boys.  Hey, I found something. 
[01:16:30]  Found a little something.  A little something.  Well, here's a test we're going to do with Noah.  We got Rent Boys and then we got something from Penthouse Forum, I believe, right?  Uh-huh.  Penthouse Forum.  You know how these things are.  People write in these fake fantasies and push them off as real.  Can I suggest that we start with the real hot Penthouse Forum letter and then end with  Rent Boys so everyone has that awful taste in their mouth?  Nice way to phrase it. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, really, Alfie.  Jesus.  What do you think?  What do you want to let the guys along as it all ends with the banana song?  I don't care.  All right.  But do you want to let the listeners off the hook and do the hot Penthouse Forum thing  last?  You know who's reading this?  How hot do you think this is going to be?  All right.  Good point.  How hot do you think a Penthouse Forum letter is going to be with him reading it?  Well, the whole thing is, the whole test here is the comparison.  So which one do you want him to read first, Anthony? 
[01:17:30]  Well, might as well let him read the one that's going to make him puke first.  That would be the Penthouse Forum.  Penthouse, right.  Obviously.  Okay.  Noah, you're an actor, right?  Yep.  I am an actor.  So, you see the highlighted paragraphs of Penthouse Forum?  Yep.  Why are you going?  There's mine.  This is supposed to be.  Because it involves girls.  This is supposed to be really hot.  No, this is like storytelling time. 
[01:18:00]  It's a little weird.  But you're an actor, right?  Yeah.  So you could really present this as dialogue and not just reading it all monotone, right?  And why are you still wearing the $300 scarf?  Because it's $300.  He doesn't trust any of us.  Earlier...  Daniel, take it and hock it.  Earlier you said that it's because it just came from outside.  Yeah.  Scott, take it off.  Burberry.  What is it?  Burberry.  Burberry?  Yeah.  Burberry.  Chris Ben knew that. 
[01:18:30]  Hey, not that these guys don't.  I know.  Boston ass.  Bono wears one.  What are we, bums?  You have a bunch of asses that work for us.  What's that stuff?  It's toilet paper.  These guys don't use that.  They just use their hands and their watch.  They're all like monkeys.  Eventually, we've got to get Steve in here to talk about his imaginary friend, Ramone.  Ramone.  What the hell is going on with that?  Oh, 911.  Ramone, fill the bucket with peroxide and lower my head into it.  Ramone, clean that up. 
[01:19:00]  Or is it clean this up?  His pal Ramone.  He's got a pal.  An imaginary friend named Ramone.  Ramone.  And we're wasting time with Noah?  I know.  There's major issues going on with Steve.  Steve is a bonafide horse's ass.  Ramone.  What?  All right, Noah.  We're ready.  Give it your all.  All right.  I'll read along.  So this is the penthouse one.  All right.  Get into character now. 
[01:19:30]  You're a heterosexual male.  Really work it.  That's not going to be too hard, but okay.  Obviously.  Not reading from this.  All right.  I pulled off her pants and panties.  I took off her shirt and used to gag her mouth.  She was loved with only her bra, and I told her she was now my slave.  This is your acting?  Dude, start over, man.  This is like acting.  There are guys in their car that just want a jacket. 
[01:20:00]  Read this like dialogue.  Now picture this scene.  You're one of these kiss and tell guys.  You're a guy with his buddy.  You're sitting at the bar.  You railed this girl that both of you have been looking at, right?  You're like a construction worker.  Yeah.  You're a construction worker.  Just off the job, you went for a few pops at your local tavern.  You're crass and rude.  You have no, you don't hold back to your friends with the sex stories.  You tell them.  So you got to kind of, you know, you lean over to them. 
[01:20:30]  You've done a couple of shots, and now you're explaining what happened that night with this chick.  All right.  I think I needed that motivation, but now I can do it.  No problem.  Her name is Julia.  Julia.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  Okay.  Let's go.  Okay.  I pulled off her pants and panties.  I took off her shirt and used to gag her mouth.  She was left with only her bra, and I told her she was now my slave.  She nodded her approval, and I caught her rah.  Her breasts were two huge pillows with dark, chunky nipples. 
[01:21:00]  I began licking and sucking those sweet titties, biting her left nipple while squeezing the right.  She was squirming, and I realized she was having a massive organism while I dominated her.  By now, my cock was so hard it was painful.  I dropped my pants underwear without warning,  I plunged my nine-inch tool off her pussy.  The gag in her mouth muffled her screams as I popped her cherry.  I began pumping and biting her tits so hard that when I came,  I left teeth indentations in her nipples. 
[01:21:30]  The next paragraph.  The next paragraph.  Yeah.  We both came at the same time.  She passed out while I filled with my sperm cocktails.  After a few seconds, she came around, and I instructed her that she was my slave,  and that she was to move into my home.  She obediently called home and told her mother to bring her belongings over to my place.  I don't like the way you don't say words completely.  Like, she obediently called home and told her mother to bring her belongings over to my place. 
[01:22:00]  You don't say the words.  Belongings.  He just doesn't...  Belongs.  Oh, obediently.  After that reading, I got an inny.  Oh.  Yeah.  That was the worst.  I'm about to blame that on my training in journalism school.  It's not the best.  Training in journalism school?  Yeah.  There was no emotion to that whatsoever.  It was a very monotone delivery.  I had a bigger ride when Cronkite...  Cronkite.  Oh.  Oh, at least you didn't say Cronkate.  Cronkite gave a sexier proclamation of JFK's death was where I was going. 
[01:22:30]  Took his glasses off.  That was hot.  Yeah.  Cronkite.  Cronkite.  Oh, you horrible.  He's disgusted with himself.  Yeah, there was really no...  I wasn't feeling that.  I didn't feel any sincerity in it.  You know?  I felt like you were reading this without really any first-hand knowledge of what was going on in this. 
[01:23:00]  Well, it's a first-time read.  I mean, I guess I practiced a little bit.  It might have been...  Or if you did it once.  Yeah.  Well, okay.  If you practiced.  Maybe we can do better with Rent Boys.  All right.  Maybe we can.  Jimmy, Rent Boys.  Where is the paragraph that Jimmy is...  This was highlighted for quite a while ago.  Starting right there and finishing right there.  How long is it?  Is it just as long as the one he just read?  Yes.  Now, again...  Probably shorter, actually.  Let's get some motivation here. 
[01:23:30]  Yes.  Again, now you're in a bar where Ben would know, because he knows the city.  What bar?  Where would this be?  What location are we looking at here in Manhattan?  Well, if Noah says, what's my motivation?  It's Thursday.  Okay.  So, you're at a...  Yeah, what's a good gay bar here in the city, Ben?  Not saying anything about... 
[01:24:00]  A manhole.  Not saying anything about Ben's sexuality.  No, Ben just knows everything.  He just knows everything about the city.  Yeah, we just know Ben knows everything.  Where is that, Ben?  Well, actually, the manhole doesn't exist anymore.  No?  No.  Well, Opie and I have actually been to the new manhole.  Hold on a minute.  Oh, yeah?  Hold on a minute.  It's been renovated.  Explain.  The new manhole's been renovated?  Yeah.  Was that the place we went to Cool Lounge?  Yeah, with your friend that we ditched?  Oh, Fred.  Fred's cool.  Yeah, we ditched him.  Yeah.  Wow.  The new manhole.  Is it in the same place as the old manhole was? 
[01:24:30]  Well, we're hanging out in this lounge, and it's really...  It's actually really...  It's really cool, and there are hot babes all over the place, Anthony.  Really?  At the new manhole?  Yes.  It's not the place you go off the street, and you go around back, and then you go in  through the back door?  No, I wasn't saying.  I kind of thought that.  No?  No, it's really...  It actually is a cool place.  Yeah, I didn't...  Opie had to ditch his friend, so I had to pretend the cell phone wasn't working.  And Ben was like...  And you were telling us that it was like an S&M club or something? 
[01:25:00]  No, it was the manhole.  Yeah, but it was like whips.  You used to be the manhole?  Jim probably.  You probably went there, Jim.  Yeah, I've never gone to any of those clubs.  Never sex clubs.  Never.  All right.  Let's try the...  Let's say the duplex.  That would be a good place on Christopher Street.  Christopher Street.  There you go.  The duplex.  You're hanging out.  Wait, did you say Christopher Street?  You're a...  There you go.  Did you say Christopher Street?  I thought I heard it.  I hope I could be wrong.  You're a gay man.  Let's just...  Now you're acting.  You're a gay man.  Just acting.  And you're hanging out at this bar on Christopher Street, and another gay man's next to you,  and again, you're just telling him what happened the night before, trying to get each other 
[01:25:30]  a little hot as you sit there and sip your Cosmo.  Mind you, my dad's listening to this right now, so...  Oh, he is?  Oh, yeah.  Your dad listens?  Oh, yeah.  To the show?  Just got a subscription, yep.  That's good.  Smart move.  Yeah.  Why would you do that?  I don't know.  He finds it amusing, so I don't know.  All right.  Does he find you amusing?  I'm not sure.  Has he ever sat you down and just had a talk with you?  Not really.  Never had the talk about the girls and stuff? 
[01:26:00]  What'd you do with them?  Did he have the sex talk with you when you were younger?  No.  The birds and the bees?  Or the birds and the birds?  Yeah.  Does he like your choice?  What happens when two drone workers decide to get together and say,  the hell with the queen?  Does he accept the girls you bring home?  Does he like them?  Is he friendly with them?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Right now he's rolling his eyes going, oh my God, my son's lying.  He's never brought a girl home to my house. 
[01:26:30]  So anyway, Anthony, where is this taking place?  Christopher Street.  Where?  Christopher Street.  We're all gay.  Stick and see.  In our way.  T-cells low.  We've got the HIV.  It's a great way to lose some weight.  On our way to Christopher Street.  Dead in days, lesions all over my face. 
[01:27:00]  Pound my angst and grab some A-Z-T.  You can watch my life wither away on our way to Christopher Street.  On our way to Christopher Street.  On our way to Christopher Street.  All right.  Well, there you go.  There's your motivation there, Noah.  And now, if you will, read from Rent Boys. 
[01:27:30]  Rent Boys.  There we go.  That's really motivating.  Everybody, compare it to his reading from Penthouse Forum.  All right.  If you will.  Give it some emotion.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  I'll give it a shot.  All right.  Rack.  Swallowing it and sucking it as if I could coax more juice from the slit, I closed and opened  my eyes to look up his ripped, fur-coated abs and hard, flat chest.  I saw his pale green eyes looking lackadaisically back just before his lids closed shut.  When his fingers knotted in my hair, he guided me across the expanse of his massive cock. 
[01:28:00]  Making me learn its dimensions and texture with my tongue.  By the time he pulled it out and slapped it lightly against my cheek and nose, I knew  everything about him.  I kissed his full, smooth nuts, sniffing at the dark, tangled hair above his cock as he  rolled a condom over his crown and downed his shaft.  I bent to get a bottle of lube from the bag and slowly stroked clear fluid up and down his  hard, twitching cock. 
[01:28:30]  Without saying a word, John took the bottle from me.  How'd it near his cock?  Letting the slick gel drip down to his crotch.  All right.  I'll admit it, man.  This is insert abuse at this point.  Wow.  All right.  Now let's...  That was interesting.  And I appreciate you sharing that with us.  Now let's get the book first.  Now read from the book.  Oh.  Wow.  You know, I gotta say. 
[01:29:00]  I gotta say.  There was a...  And I'm not drawing any conclusions.  Because we really don't know.  And quite frankly, it doesn't matter.  We don't really care.  Nothing matters either way.  It doesn't...  And I'm not drawing conclusions.  But all I'm saying is, there did seem to be a hint more emotion, familiarity in that  reading than there was in the Penthouse reading.  Now maybe you could attribute that to, you know, Penthouse was your first reading.  And this one's your second.  Yeah.  One was a reading and one was a memory. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  You seemed a bit more nervous with the second reading.  You seemed more comfortable.  And there was more emotion when you said cock than when you said your nine-inch tool in  her pussy.  You know?  It just seemed like you emphasized cock.  Like when you said that the other gentleman slapped your face with it and made you learn  its textures with your tongue.  That seemed, you know, there was a hint of, ah, yes, I recall this. 
[01:30:00]  That's right.  The old learning process.  You know?  And with your Penthouse read, it was kind of like, huh, what is this?  Hi.  What?  I'm...  You did what with...  The other reading, it sounded to me like you were just saying hi to an old friend.  An old lubed up friend smacking in the cheek. 
[01:30:30]  I think I should get another shot at the Penthouse.  Maybe sometime.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, maybe sometime.  Maybe we can do that at some later date.  Yeah.  Not that it was a bad read, but when you're describing her body and you start retching a  little bit, that makes us think that you're not into it.  Oh, my God.  Herp.  Herp.  Herp.  All right.  Well, bang up job, Noah.  His furry abs. 
[01:31:00]  Furry abs.  Smooth nutsack.  Herp.  This just in from Ginny.  Noah's dad just shot himself next to his XM radio.  Herp.  All right.  Well, thank you, Noah.  Sorry, Dad, if you're listening.  Hump X from Rhode Island wants to know what Christopher Street is.  He has no clue, I guess.  Is there a Rhode Island reference to him?  Yeah, Rhode Island. 
[01:31:30]  Rhode Island.  It's a place here in Manhattan.  It's a street in an area that a lot of gay men frequent.  Isn't there a big gay area in Rhode Island or something?  Providence is supposed to be like a big...  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think there's a lot of dykes in Rhode Island, right?  You might be thinking of Provincetown.  Provincetown, right.  Providence.  Which is the tip of Cape Cod.  Noah, very, very interesting, to say the least. 
[01:32:00]  Thank you.  Hey, hello, Julia.  Good morning, America.  There's a guy with a sign that just said, hello, Julia.  Oh, hey.  There he goes, Noah.  Ben, what do you think?  We really don't know.  He's laughing at this idiot that goes, yeah, there's a gay part of Rhode Island.  Providence.  I don't know.  Wrong state.  Provincetown.  Cape Cod.  Oh, I don't know.  I know.  I know this stuff.  Is that what Burberry's factory is?  No, it's everything.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we should play the Norm MacDonald clip as we go to break here.  Yeah.  Hey.  We love this clip.  And we'll continue with the Opie and Anthony program. 
[01:32:30]  Did you see the State of the Union address, Anthony?  I certainly did.  Did you have some observations, maybe?  I saw plenty of smirking and mugging and smugness.  But on the whole, yeah, I think it was an all right speech.  All right.  We'll talk about that next and some of the news that is happening today.  Okay?  Roy.  What else do we have today?  Do we have Jay London coming in?  Jay London is here.  Oh, right on.  Man, I love Jay London.  Absolutely love Jay London.  Thank you. 
[01:33:00]  And then we have some girl that wants to sing some dirty songs.  Yeah, she wrote you an email.  Hopefully she won't beat Anthony up with lights.  Remember the last one?  Remember, what was that poetry check years ago?  Naked poetry is a skank.  Yeah.  That blue guys in the park during Shakespeare in the Park.  Right.  And then she came in wrapped in Christmas lights reading poetry out of this big book.  I said one thing and she started beating me up with a poetry book.  This whole thing reminds me of that.  That's why I brought it up.  This chick.  Who's this chick in?  Is she hot?  I think she's a professional, though, no? 
[01:33:30]  She wrote you an email.  What did she do?  Well, I forwarded it to you and figured it would be all right.  She sounded like she had some chops and we'll see what she's all about.  What did she do?  She just sings dirty songs, I guess.  Oh.  Is she parody, Ben?  I think she sent us a sample or something and it wasn't bad, so I don't know.  Also, I think you got some MP3s of some newscasts.  Oh, where are those?  I don't know.  Did Steve give them to you?  No, Steve hasn't given them to us.  We're still looking for that news person.  By the way, can we get the Mad Mexican on the air today before he starts his show at 9 o'clock?  Sure, we can do that.  All right, good. 
[01:34:00]  You need to be in bad taste as you look back on it.  Maybe at the time you thought it was a good play, but you look back on it and you think that was in bad taste.  Well, sometimes, like in stand-up, I'll do jokes that are, like one time I was doing this thing in San Francisco  and they were all gay people in the audience, they told me, so I figured I'll do it.  In San Francisco?  No.  So I figured I'd do stuff about gay people so that they could relate to it.  Yeah, it's warm up.  They love that.  And so I was talking about, because I went to this gay pride parade and I saw in it there were these old men and old ladies 
[01:34:30]  like with these signs that said, we are proud of our gay son, you know.  And so I was saying, that's an odd thing to be proud of, you know, because it's not an achievement, you know.  It's not like something you work all your life to be gay or anything like that.  And I just wondered, I just, I had a hard time believing that these 50, 60-year-old men are actually bragging,  you know, at work, like they're, hey, Bill, you know, my kid, oh my God, we're proud of him, Johnny.  He graduated from Harvard, you know, first in his class, you know what I mean? 
[01:35:00]  And now he's articling over at a law firm and, oh yeah, he loves c**k.  You know?  The s**t.  He can't get enough c**k in his mouth, his ass, his kids always talk.  I got a, I got a picture of the boy here sucking another man's c**k.  I want to show you.  Live from Mardi Gras.  Norton and Friends. 
[01:35:30]  That's hilarious.  Opie and Anthony.  Live from the Crazy Horse Cabaret.  Monday and Tuesday, February 7th and 8th.  Anthony and Opie.  From 2 p.m. to 5 p.m.  Live from the Crazy Horse Cabaret at 226 Bourbon Street in New Orleans, Louisiana.  ONA.  And Jimmy Norton as Norton.  Call 504-525-5801 for more information.  Or go to opieandanthony.com.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  XM202. 
[01:36:00]  Everybody say, when you hear that's all, you got to get it underway.  Word up.  It's a cold word.  No matter what you say it, you know there's only light.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  Jay London from Last Comic Standing is in the house.  He's going through security as we speak with Master Poe. 
[01:36:30]  And we'll get him in a little bit.  Get him in next week sometime with that security.  Oh, is he snapping pictures and mug shots and stuff?  I don't understand what that's all about.  Why do our guests need to be photographed?  It's amazing.  I don't know.  I really don't.  I have no clue.  I don't really get it and I don't really want to know.  So, let him do his job, I guess, whatever that is.  Righty-o.  And we'll do our radio show and we'll all be happy.  Right, Anthony? 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, goddamn right.  All right, let's say hi to D-Boy in Jersey.  D-Boy, what's up?  D-Boy.  D-Boy.  Hello?  Are the buttons pushed correctly?  Yeah, no, he's there.  Dude from New Jersey, what's up?  I'm calling you out.  You're calling us out, why?  Uh-oh.  I'm not, because you're scammers.  We're scammers, okay?  Why are we scammers?  Spock, explain.  Well, you guys are like, you know, you have little red shirts around you. 
[01:37:30]  You know, all the people.  Like, when Noah, you really just messed him over.  I don't want to say fuck, but, uh...  What do you mean red shirts?  You know, from Star Trek.  Oh, if you explain it, it's not funny.  I don't know what you mean, stupid.  I don't watch Star Trek.  Nah, I like you, no end.  All right, hold on, hold on, Anthony.  Sorry, I shot.  What is a red shirt?  Because you were, like, into Star Trek for a little while.  Red shirts are the security guys.  They're the guys that beam down first and get killed right away.  Oh, okay. 
[01:38:00]  While, you know, Kirk and Spock and Bones and McCoy, well, Scotty, live to see another day.  Oh, okay.  All right, so what's your point?  Well, like, I don't know.  I just feel really bad for Noah because you're just putting him in the awful position.  You can just hear it in his voice.  Yeah, it's funny, but, like, why do you put him through such hell?  Is this Noah calling from another room?  I'm looking for him.  By the way, as we just said, Noah's in the other room with all the other interns. 
[01:38:30]  They're all kind of getting along, and Noah's clapping and laughing.  So I don't think Noah has a problem with what's going on on the radio show.  What, do you feel for Noah?  Is that what it is?  Yeah, I feel for him.  Maybe a similar situation happened to you, sir?  Is that it?  Are you a gay fella?  And some boys were mean, maybe?  I don't really want to talk about it.  Your preferences.  All right, so you're a gay fella.  That's okay.  Well, no, I'm not gay. 
[01:39:00]  You've said many times on the show.  I had some shit happen to me, and people, like, you know.  What happened to you?  What happened to you?  Make your point.  What happened to you?  That you felt like you had to call this radio show because you feel like we're doing something to Noah.  What happened to you?  Well, it's just uncomfortable.  Like, because, you know, you're not saying he's gay, but, like, you set him up, like, you know, like, basically he is.  And, like, I don't know.  Like, you know, I just had, like, you know, I experimented when I was younger. 
[01:39:30]  All right.  Oh, a little monster rain, maybe.  A little monster rain, and then what happened?  But the kid was a little bit older, and I didn't really like, like, and I was just confused about it all.  Tell us more.  How old a boy was he?  Yeah.  How old were you?  It happened back the first time.  It was like...  The first time?  First time.  He had a lot of influence over me. 
[01:40:00]  You went back for seconds, did you?  Now it's eating at you.  How old of a boy were you?  Ten the first time.  Ten?  Oh.  And how old was he?  He was, like, 13.  He was, like, really cool and everything.  Sounds it.  Yeah.  And I really, like, looked up to him.  Like, he was, like, big pimpin'.  Looked up to him from your ears.  Not at that age.  Yeah, but, you know, he played all the games, like, truth or dare.  Yeah.  And I never got it.  All right.  So what happened?  How did he make the move on you?  You know, he was like, oh, we should play truth or dare. 
[01:40:30]  Okay.  And I didn't really know what it was about, but, you know, all the older kids were doing  it, and, you know, you know, like, he was, like, just wanted me to touch him, and I  just did, and he would just call back, like, you know, like, want to, like, you know,  like, every so often, like, you would just, even now, like, he'll, like, come over, like,  you know, I'm already, like, 24, and, like, you know, he'll, like, come over, because he 
[01:41:00]  still parties, dates mad young girls, and, like, he'll come over, like, and he'll, like,  try and, like, hook up with me, because I did it up until, like, I was 17.  Well, you had a seven-year relationship.  You can't blame the fellow for wanting to come back and dip in again.  Yeah, but it was always, like, he would come and get me every six months, because he lived  down the block, and, like, you know, because he was busy with his friends.  He was older, and, you know, he...  How did he coerce you the first time?  With a PlayStation?  No, that wasn't even out back then. 
[01:41:30]  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Want to go play PlayStation?  Back to my place.  Hey, hey.  Well, when you're 10, I can understand it.  But I know, but I...  By the time you were legally driving, how did he convince you?  I was alive for a while, but it's, like, you know...  Well, you're gay, bro, so what's the problem?  No, but I'm not anymore.  Not anymore, right?  No, I wasn't only gay, because...  You cured it with Tylenol.  I'm finally on the condition that, like...  Dude, you were, like, having gay relations from 10 to 17, at least. 
[01:42:00]  You're gay.  What's the big deal?  Well, I like having the female relations more.  See?  So he was forced into it.  But you can't be forced into something for seven years.  Perhaps he was.  Perhaps he...  Well, no, it wasn't like, you know, it wasn't like every day it would be, like,  you know, every couple of months, like, he would just spring up, like, you know, like,  you know, kind of make a move.  And maybe we'd go a year or two without, like, anything being said.  Like, it never happened.  But why did you keep going back there?  I didn't go back there.  He would not, you know, come over and... 
[01:42:30]  But he didn't force himself on you, obviously.  At one point, you had to decide, well, this is something I'm going to do or not do.  Right?  And that's what, you know...  And that's why I was really confused for a while, because, you know, it felt good.  All right.  So you're gay.  Nah, but...  Or you have gay tendencies, so...  Everyone.  Right now...  But right now, you're thinking, you know, you're more into women, right?  No, I've had.  I really have.  Like, I didn't have...  I used to go to massage parlors. 
[01:43:00]  There's one up in Morristown where our hockey coach got caught or something.  What kind of massage parlor was this?  Oh, like, you know, they give you the hurricane jerk.  But, um...  Everyone's saying this guy's lying, by the way.  Oh, really?  I think everyone on Instant Feedback, there isn't one of them that isn't saying, full  of shit, guy's lying, sack, I'm waiting for him to drop a Norton gig reference.  Right.  I mean, very rarely are stories this hot believable.  Yeah.  It really did happen.  Actually, Jim is rolling his eyes, so... 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know what we can do for you.  Yeah.  Are you just faking to get on the air, or what?  No.  It just kind of happened.  What do you mean?  We go for two years, then what, the guy would just show up and pull out his mule and go,  you remember?  Basically.  All right.  Basically.  All right.  Well, don't worry about Noah.  Noah can handle himself.  He's just fine.  I'm totally cool.  I think this guy's calling because he wants to kind of hook up with Noah.  Would you like to hook up with Noah? 
[01:44:00]  Wouldn't mind.  I swing both ways.  But I'm definitely not gay.  Swings both ways, boys and men.  All right.  Well, we're going to let you be, bro.  All right?  Don't worry about Noah.  Noah can handle himself.  I think he wants to be a character, Opie.  Yeah.  Now you're hanging up, and he's desperate.  He's going to say something.  Noah, you're cool, right?  I'm totally cool.  And we really don't know what you are.  I mean, you claim you have had girlfriends and things like that.  Who are we to say? 
[01:44:30]  Who are we to say?  Who are we to observe?  We just kind of find it fun to try to figure it out.  That's all.  All right?  Right.  All right.  Thanks, Noah.  No problem.  See, Noah was laughing.  And he's fine with this.  Sure is.  You're saying he's laughing, so he's happy.  Joyous.  What's another word for that that I could think of?  Happy.  Happy.  Joyous.  Like offensive.  Thrilled.  Thrilled.  Glad.  Overjoyed.  Overjoyed.  Gay.  Bubbly.  Right.  Gay.  Yeah.  Words like that. 
[01:45:00]  Sure.  Gay.  Gay.  He's in a gay mood.  Sure.  Happy.  Prancing about the place.  In a very gay mood.  In a Howard Hughes outfit.  We got to get out of the gay zone.  Let's get out of the gay zone.  Yeah.  All right.  The State of the Union, Anthony.  Oh, yes.  What are people talking about today?  Well, the State of the Union.  The plane crash that we kind of, you know, saw immediately after it happened.  They were...  The miracle plane crash. 
[01:45:30]  No one died.  Yep.  No one died.  At first they were reporting that people died, though.  Remember?  No, they said two missing, 11 missing or two missing or something.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Yeah.  At first they said 11 missing, two injured.  Then they said 11 injured, two missing.  And then they said they found everybody and everyone's injured.  And that's it.  That's amazing.  Yeah.  Even the car it hit on the road?  Yeah.  The guy that got hit in the car.  Was that on...  That was on 46, right?  Route 46?  Yep.  What, did it just clip the top of it or something?  Yeah.  It ran it right over, I think, with the wing. 
[01:46:00]  Because the footage they showed, remember, yesterday, we were like, there's no way that  guy's alive.  I know.  Or that girl or what have you.  It turns out it was a guy, right?  A guy, yeah.  Some guy driving around and then he's driving across and a plane comes flying at him.  Not flying at him, unfortunately.  It didn't take off.  It's like at takeoff speed, which is pretty quick.  And went right through the fence off the end of the runway into the highway.  Hit that guy's car.  Hit a bunch of cars in the parking lot of the factory or warehouse that it ran into. 
[01:46:30]  Ran into it.  I guess everybody got out before it burst into flames.  Mm-hmm.  And, yeah, a bunch of people injured, but no one killed.  It looked pretty gruesome yesterday on the news.  They were pumping foam into the plane.  You wondered, ugh, are there barbecued people in there or something?  But, no, everyone got out.  I was thinking that, at the least, the pilots had to be dead.  I know.  They went through a brick wall.  Yeah, hitting that brick wall like that.  Yep.  No, I think the pilots got a broken leg. 
[01:47:00]  Even Ebersole's plane, which was a bad one.  I mean, his son died and someone else died, but a lot of them got off, too.  Got out.  Something to be said if you're still on the ground, you know?  Yeah.  And an instance like yesterday, if the plane's in one piece, there's a really good chance  that people can get off of the thing.  As long as you get out of there and it doesn't burst into flames, the fuselage doesn't come  apart, and there isn't fire immediately in the cabin, a lot of people could get out of  that.  You know, the Ebersole thing, though, the thing was in flames as it was barreling down 
[01:47:30]  the runway.  And when it finally crashed, it just kind of exploded.  You're in the wrong place, wrong time kind of thing.  You're screwed.  But, yeah, seems like everything worked out on that one.  They're going to question the pilot, I guess.  It's kind of the best thing, you know?  When a plane crash and the pilot's alive, you're going to get the info of what happened.  They're saying it was ice.  It just seems that these corporate jets go down the most.  Yeah.  Just about every plane crash you hear about these days, it's some kind of corporate jet  or some kind of privately owned plane. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  Well, they don't have the same maintenance standards, and also the wings are smaller.  Like big wings, larger planes' wings will, I believe, expand a little bit, which cracks  the ice.  Yeah.  But these things can't do that, and they actually did interview the pilot, and he said  one of the reasons that...  Oh, sorry.  No, no.  The pilot was saying that it probably would have been a much worse tragedy on the highway,  but he did have easy pass, so he kind of zipped...  Just zipped right through it, didn't he? 
[01:48:30]  And I know people are going to call up and go, you don't need easy pass on 46.  Dicks, I know.  All right.  Bobby Bigrigger.  What's up, Bobby?  I like that, Jimmy.  You had easy pass.  Thanks, sweetie.  Watched the news last night.  You guys were probably sleeping.  Co-pilot, broken leg, passenger of the car was on life support, and the driver of the  car was in stable condition.  And other than that, everybody just bumps and bruises and shit like that.  Yeah, that's not bad considering what we saw on TV.  No, not at all.  Hey, Jimmy, I'll be making a delivery out there in Pittsburgh. 
[01:49:00]  I was wondering, I've got to go to...  What the hell's in there?  Improv?  Yes.  You got a number so I can get directions to this place?  I've never delivered there before.  Oh, you've got to make a good point.  You've got to make a delivery to the Improv.  Yeah.  The number's 412-462-5233.  Maybe I'll see you when I'm out there this weekend, coincidentally.  Good deal, buddy.  All right, good luck with that delivery.  All right.  Thanks.  Thanks.  The guy in Jersey's calling back.  Bro.  Yeah.  Why are you calling back?  Well, no, I called back to say something to the screeners to just say, like, you know, 
[01:49:30]  like, I was serious and...  Because that's what I meant by you scammed me because, you know, just first you sent something,  like, obviously, because since I was defending Noah, you know, you had to be like, oh, why?  And then you got me out.  I just wanted to tell the phone screeners because...  The guy's for real, by the way.  He's not...  You sound like a mental patient.  Yeah, he's got something going on.  But Norton's like...  Norton still thinks you're scamming us.  I think you're for real.  I think you're just a little wacky.  And not because you swing both ways, but I think you got something else going on in your 
[01:50:00]  head.  Well, I have been the psychiatric inpatient, but it wasn't like one of those, like, hardcore  ones.  All right.  Well, thank you, bro.  All right.  Don't worry about Noah.  You should worry about yourself.  Okay?  Wait.  No, wait.  See, he wants to be part of this.  Thing.  He wants to be part of the show.  This thing of ours.  And he's trying to figure out a way to do it, and this was like his first scam that he's 
[01:50:30]  trying to do.  You really think he's scamming?  Yeah.  He doesn't sound sincere.  No.  He sounds a little wacky.  Yeah.  Like he's making it up.  All right.  What happened to the girl with the dirty songs?  God, we have the worst, worst track record as far as guests on this program.  They don't show up.  No one shows up.  What time is she supposed to be here, Eric?  She was supposed to be here around 7.30, right?  Yeah.  About a half hour ago.  You got a contact number for her?  Every day we start this radio show with a whole list of people that are going to be 
[01:51:00]  coming through here, and for some reason, one after another, they don't show up.  No shows.  It is the weirdest thing.  Two Sports Illustrated models in a row?  Right.  Well, perhaps they heard the one phone call we had from old, old, ugly toes.  Well, hey, the two of those girls didn't call up.  I mean, that's three minutes of good radio lost right there.  Worthless twats.  Get Steve in here real fast.  What's up, Danny?  She just got here.  Oh, she just got here?  She's been here.  Oh, she has been here?  Oh, okay.  Yeah, but where is she?  Poe is fucking up this radio show. 
[01:51:30]  We got to get these people in here.  How long does it take to get someone from the front door to the studio?  Someone explain that to me.  Seriously.  Because it's not even funny anymore.  Did I just hear what I think I heard?  What?  I go to the bathroom, and I see these people stuck in this little box right inside the  front door for way too long.  It's a dumb radio show.  This isn't the freaking FBI.  She got here right around the same time Jay London did.  That's a while ago.  So Poe was putting Jay's info in. 
[01:52:00]  Now he's just finishing her up.  She'll be in.  Just finishing?  They showed up a half hour ago.  What info is there?  Here's a paper.  You're going on the air.  Is that okay?  Signature.  Done.  That's generally what happens.  All kidding aside, we laugh a little bit about it, but it's dumb.  It's stupid.  It's a girl that sings stupid, dirty songs.  They want really specific info on everybody.  We had meetings about this.  Well, they're going to have to either A, simplify it, or we're just going to stop doing it.  Yeah, or just mail this stuff to these people before they get here, so it's all signed before 
[01:52:30]  they get here.  Or they're done.  Do you mind going on the radio right now and sign?  Has anyone else noticed that we've been kind of stalling for the last 20 minutes instead  of having some fun with a girl that sings dirty songs or maybe get Jay London on the  air?  So he's holding up the show.  And I've got to blame him because it's either the system or him personally.  But all I know is that she should have been in here already.  Hold on.  We'll get to you in a second.  Okay. 
[01:53:00]  Because we do have to take a break, but it's ridiculous.  And Steve, while you're in here.  Yeah.  What's up with you and your imaginary friend, Ramon?  He's not my imaginary friend.  He's just the...  Did you make him up?  Yeah, I did.  But he's yours.  He's my creation.  I'll certainly take credit for that.  But Ramon is the byproduct of something I learned when I was working at NEW.  They told me that a lot of the deep voice guys that do voiceover for movies and for TV. 
[01:53:30]  Check this out.  Listen, this is...  Explanation.  No, this is...  Here's the explanation.  This is exactly where it came from.  They do a lot of their voiceover work from home in a home studio on ISTN lines.  So a lot of them are just traipsing around home in their bath robes or sweatpants, making  millions of dollars, mind you, doing voice work.  So you believe there's some guy walking around and his house boy is there.  And he has a house boy.  And as he's doing these voiceovers, sometimes things happen and he's got to go, Ramon...  Exactly.  ...lean...  So you feel like you're one of these big voice guys and you need a little house boy. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, no, no, no.  That's why I pitch my voice down, because I have to make it sound like it's not me.  Right.  So...  Yeah, exactly.  So not only does he have an imaginary friend named Ramon, he has an imaginary him.  Oh, this is not going well.  Did you just call from Jersey two minutes ago?  What do you think?  You think way too much into this.  No, this is how you...  I sit in a room with no windows, mind you, for hours on end, so sometimes you're...  Yeah.  What's the profile of Ramon?  What kind of person is he?  Well, that's interesting.  Is he short? 
[01:54:30]  Because I brought this up with Nathaniel and Danny yesterday, and they each have a different  visualization for what Ramon looks like.  Really?  All right, get those guys in here.  Look at them.  I'm all excited.  They get air time.  All right.  So, what...  You know, I think Danny said it might...  Yeah.  Danny said, I think he looked something like Ricky, the other intern.  But then Nathaniel had a totally different look for what Ramon might have looked like.  And for all I know, everybody's got some view.  I believe he looks like the cover of Rent Boys.  Danny, do you think it's a little weird that Steve has an imaginary friend named Ramon? 
[01:55:00]  It's a little strange.  And what do you think Ramon looks like?  To me, he looks something like Hervé Villachez if he was normal-sized.  Oh, okay.  But with the Ricky mustache.  Nathaniel?  Do you think it's weird that he has an imaginary friend?  I don't know.  I kind of like Steve.  No, it does.  Yeah.  It's not about liking him.  Do you know that we smash the people we really like on this show?  Yeah.  Well, I think he does have a whole persona worked out. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  Definitely sort of a...  Yeah, I think Steve's given a lot of thought to this.  Yeah.  I mean, he hasn't stuck his hand in a sock and started talking to him.  It's probably good, but it could be soon.  No, no, no.  That's not happening.  But you do have to...  Is Ramon with you right now?  No, Ramon is not in the room.  Can you channel Ramon?  No, because you'll never hear from Ramon.  You'll only hear Ramon being referenced.  You do hear from Ramon.  Steve's not here right now, Mrs. Tarrant.  Ramon is the little boy who lives in my mouth. 
[01:56:00]  Is Ramon your Jenny Piccolo?  It's a friend that we'll just never see.  It was Jenny Piccolo, right, from Happy Day?  Yeah.  Ramon will...  Yeah, well, kind of.  Ramon will never be referenced in the first person.  You'll never hear a little voice pop up and go,  Yes, sir.  You'll never hear that.  You will only hear Ramon being referenced like he's being addressed or in the third person.  Do you want him to talk, but, you know, he's not supposed to?  No, it's...  You like ice cream, Ramon? 
[01:56:30]  Do you want to secretly be Ramon?  Oh, no, no, no.  Ramon's a houseboy.  Yeah.  Ramon's a house...  You don't aspire to be Ramon.  I'm thinking you might want to be a houseboy.  No.  Kind of like where someone tells you what to do.  I'll bet you in his mind, Ramon is probably 5'10", very svelte, smooth abs, unclipped, hung 10, fat, doesn't speak English, willing to do anything for a buck.  Is that who Ramon is?  Ramon.  Can we have an example of Ramon?  Does Derek have a promo he can play featuring Ramon?  Yeah.  He'll find it in a second. 
[01:57:00]  How many Ramon promos are there?  Honestly, there was only...  I just did the second one yesterday, but I'm thinking there could be a series of Ramon.  Of course there will be.  When do you think maybe we should take Ramon to the doctor?  All right.  If Derek's ready, let's hear the Ramon promo, Anthony.  All right.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony.  Ooh, it's in my shoes.  Ramon, clean this up. 
[01:57:30]  It's a little weird, Steve.  Of course it is.  Now your houseboy's got to clean the crap out of your shoes.  Do you pay him well, at least?  No, houseboys generally don't get paid well.  You're not making a lot of money.  No, I mean, let's say maybe he's Guatemalan.  Maybe he's uneducated.  You do great production for the radio show, but I've got to tell you,  it's a little weird.  The Ramon thing.  Did you buy him after his mother was killed in the tsunami because of child slavery?  Did a tree go through his mom's head?  No, actually, he is from Central America, I believe.  Oh, Central America. 
[01:58:00]  Well, no, I mean, the tsunami hit around the Philippines,  so you're certainly not going to find any Ramones out there.  Is Ramones' last name Robinson, by any chance?  Hey, good reference.  Good reference.  But no.  I didn't even have to dress up.  That's very good.  Oh.  I'm a part of it, though.  All right, listen.  Let's listen to the second Ramon promo.  We debuted this earlier this morning.  I just love a drive in the country, laughing with Opie and Anthony. 
[01:58:30]  That plane is flying awfully low, don't you think, Ramon?  Ramon, call 9-1-1.  Now the Ramon promos are that much better and funnier.  Because now every time I hear this on the replay, I'm going to drive off the road. 
[01:59:00]  Ramon, call 9-1-1.  It sounded like you almost said, clean this up, but you went, call 9-1-1.  I was trying to enunciate it in the same fashion.  Call 9-1-1.  Now, Steve, why wouldn't you call 9-1-1?  Yeah.  Why does Ramon have to do everything for you?  Because, well, it's not, it's also, it's not me, but Ramon is a houseboy assigned to the  menial tasks that this deep voice guy does not feel that he's...  Wait, I have a problem.  What?  You're taking a leisurely drive in the country.  Why is Ramon with you? 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  See, there's a menial task that has to be, that has to be, that has to be taken care of.  Yeah, roadhead.  Yeah, exactly.  Your mule is dirty, needs to be cleaned.  Ramon, lap this up.  Perfect example, you go to a self-serve gas station, do you think this guy, this wealthy  voiceover artist is going to be...  Ramon, top off my tank.  Right, right.  Exactly.  You're a couple weeks away from coming in here with a scarf.  You know, I'm thinking that this guy has, you know, almost the half outfit, like a,  like a, not a leisure suit, what's it called? 
[02:00:00]  An ascot and a smoking jacket.  Thank you.  How does Ramon feel?  Is Ramon angry at the guy?  Ramon could be angry.  He might be bitter.  He might be bitter.  Crazy, by the way.  Crazy Steve.  You have thought about this way too long.  There's a profile on your imaginary friend Ramon.  Yeah.  Behind his back, does he like...  Are you, or the person that you're voicing in these spots, that's not Ramon, obviously,  is he married?  Um, no, no, actually, you know what? 
[02:00:30]  You know, now, now that I think of it, there are two, two of the little cartoons on, on,  on the website are, are pretty representative of what this deep voice guy and Ramon might  look like, like, like, and Ramon is, I suck, Ramon is a very short, or potentially a very  short, uh, pygmy.  I don't want to alter it too much because, yeah, because I don't want to alter it.  Let people imagine their own Ramon.  Ramon should be, you know, everyone should have their own Ramon. 
[02:01:00]  Should people start sending in, uh, maybe drawings and cartoons of what they think you  and Ramon are...  I think, I think that's a great idea.  ...are like and look like?  There's some talented artists out there.  Has Ramon ever stood there and just thrown firecrackers while other people were preparing  to rob the house?  I don't get that one.  Hmm.  Yeah, I do.  You got that one?  Yeah, um, trying to remember the name, though.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Uh, was it Boogie Nights?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I knew, I knew the scene.  I didn't remember the movie.  Boogie Nights.  He's right. 
[02:01:30]  He's right.  Yeah.  Ramon, that is a typical Ramon.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, the guy throwing the firecrackers around the house.  All right, well...  Yeah, that's a Ramon.  Ramon takes care of the menial tasks that you can't be bothered with because, you know, you're  off making the money and you can pay somebody, you know, three bucks an hour to go and clean  up diarrhea.  Really, for a casual thing, you have his salary already worked out.  Yeah.  How much does he make?  Because he lived for free in, like, the, uh...  Well...  In the, uh, that, what do they call it, that other house?  Servant's quarters.  Servant's...  No.  The pool house?  Like the pool house or something? 
[02:02:00]  Um, yeah, he could potentially.  He could potentially.  You know, you got to remember, he's, you know, he maybe doesn't have a great grasp of the  English language.  Uh-huh.  Um, you know, he's from Central America.  Um, you know, uneducated, so...  And no grasp of U.S. law as well.  I didn't say he was...  I didn't say he was underage.  I didn't say he was...  Oh, no, no.  I didn't say he was underage.  You weren't saying that.  Give the Photoshop people some, uh, some work on Wackbag.  Oh, there you go.  Photoshop people.  It's not Steve, so, you know, I don't think you have to Photoshop Steve in. 
[02:02:30]  It's a deep voice guy with a little helper named Ramon.  Sure.  Jesus.  Yeah!  No, that's...  Danny.  You got, like, a guy with a pith helmet, like an old, uh...  Yeah, exactly.  An old adventurer.  Yeah.  With the optic thing.  Yeah, he's got a monocle.  Oh, monocle, thank you.  And, like, a pith helmet and binoculars.  Mm-hmm.  His name is actually Colonel Wetpants, but...  Yeah, Colonel with, like, the, uh, with, like, the little handlebar mustache thing  going, like, well, there I was.  Yeah, exactly.  In Africa, elephant hunting, when all of the sudden Ramon came over, and then Ramon is 
[02:03:00]  a black guy, and he's a pygmy with a bone through his nose and in his hair, with a big  afro and, and, like, bracelets of bone.  Almost like a shorter LeVar Burton type.  So Ramon's not black.  No, I don't see Ramon as being black.  No, I mean, but that's, you know...  I see Ramon as...  That's why I was kind of making a reference.  Yeah, Central American, maybe.  Yeah.  Maybe, yeah.  Maybe even Mexican.  Hairless.  I see Ramon as hairless.  See?  You know, there's, now, now we've got a completely different representation of Ramon than... 
[02:03:30]  You'll see a very hairy Ramon.  Of course you do, Steve.  Do you really?  No.  A mini bear.  No.  All Ramon can say in English is sweet and cozy.  Cozy face.  All right.  Well, thank you, Steve.  We just, Anthony and I just noticed this whole Ramon thing that was kind of taking on a life  of its own and we had to kind of...  I thought you guys liked the Ramon thing.  We do.  Oh, okay.  And now they're even better now that we have the backstory. 
[02:04:00]  Are you kidding me?  Of course.  Okay, cool.  Who's not going to be paying attention to the Ramon promos and everyone's going to be  looking forward to the next one in the series?  Okey-dokey.  Ramon.  We're the only radio show that discusses show promos.  I know.  The ins and outs of the show promos.  Well, we got a lunatic making them.  There's imaginary friends.  Dude, we're all, and I mean myself, obviously, we're all psychotic around here.  A bunch of lunatics.  We've got some problems in this room. 
[02:04:30]  All right.  Well, we'll play Chemistry's Martini Steve song here.  What is it?  Steve the Bear or whatever.  And we'll get the girl in that does the dirty songs and we'll get Jay London in here.  And that's about it.  Steve.  Steve the Bear. 
[02:05:00]  Steve.  Steve the Bear.  Sweet Steve the Bear.  Sweet face.  So cozy.  We go back to his place.  Sitting in his cave.  He shows me his flame hat.  I wonder how he can wear that.  Wonder how many cubs got caught in this bear trap.  His flaming clothes are exotic.  Homorotic and like Steve.  He should have never came out the closet.  But if you wear it, the sideburn's got to be in good shape.  Can't be a cozy bear if your hair don't look great.  Steve.  Steve the Bear. 
[02:05:30]  Sweet Steve.  Steve.  Steve the Bear.  Sweet Steve.  Steve the Bear.  Sweet Steve.  Steve the Bear.  Sweet.  What is this? 
[02:06:00]  Alright, what's the problem?  Oh boy.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  The emperor is not happy with his coffee.  Oh no.  Are we going to have to break into Jim Norton?  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  Look at that cup.  What brand is on that cup?  I don't know.  It doesn't taste good because I don't like it.  Where do we get our coffee every day?  I like Starbucks.  I like Starbucks.  And I don't like supporting the savages that run most of these delis.  You're insane.  Yup.  You betcha.  You might be right.  Watch this. 
[02:06:30]  You want to taste this?  Wow, that's really nice.  What's the road against the wall?  I'm not going to die against you.  I'm a diva.  I want Starbucks coffee.  You betcha.  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  I know Starbucks is a big world order type of thing.  At least they're not funding terrorism.  All right. 
[02:07:00]  We're going to try to get the show back on the highway.  I think we're on the highway.  We're kind of zigging and zagging a little bit today.  I think we're on.  Definitely an interesting program.  That's the beauty of this show.  Yeah.  Organized chaos.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  We've got this girl that's going to come in and sing dirty songs.  What kind of dirty song?  But everyone's confused going, who booked her? 
[02:07:30]  And no one knows.  But then it turns out she's the one that Jimmy knows.  I remember Jimmy brought in a dirty song we played.  It was kind of cute.  It was like, yeah, all right, whatever.  Does every girl that comes on this show have to be somebody that Jimmy knows?  Because it's been every single one.  Mm-hmm.  He knows every girl that's been on this show.  Well, Steve wants to bring more of the girls he knows on the show.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:08:00]  Like?  All the porn stars.  Like Ramon.  He is a character, man.  He's a raving lunatic.  I've just been thinking about that a lot.  Like, who comes up with an imaginary guy named Ramon for promo spots?  I like the new Ramon spot.  Yeah, I do, too.  Now it's going to have to be a whole thing.  It has now turned into a thing, the Ramon.  So, Jimmy, what's this girl all about?  There's a lot of confusion.  Jessica is a friend of mine. 
[02:08:30]  I've known her for many years.  And she's doing comedy, and she sings, and she does, like, all kinds of songs.  I don't think it's song parodies.  I would say it's more original stuff.  Original compositions?  Yeah.  That are kind of dirty?  Humorous stuff, yeah.  Okay.  We should bring her in.  All right.  Do you want to bring Jay London in as well?  Yeah, I wonder if.  Kind of just throw it all together and see what happens?  Sure.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's get everybody in here, and let's have some fun with this.  All right.  There's Jay London. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  Freaky dude.  All right.  There's Jessica.  Hi.  And Jay London.  Hi, Jay.  What's up, Jay?  Over here.  Pull up a chair.  No, over to this microphone over there.  She probably needs an armless chair, right?  All right.  Eric will figure that out.  Eric said he wants a chair over there.  The arm is probably a pain in the ass with the guitar.  Jay, we kind of overbooked, but, I mean, don't worry about it.  We'll figure this out as we go here.  I'm dead air anyway.  I'm dead air anyways. 
[02:09:30]  I am.  I mean, go up to me.  Dude, I got to tell you really fast.  Way before last comic standing, I go out to L.A. from time to time.  Here, get the mic in front of his face.  Yeah.  And I was at the comedy store.  Right, Mike.  Yeah, I know.  You're there literally every night.  And I haven't laughed that hard, I mean, I don't know, in years.  I laughed so hard, my ribs hurt.  From me?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Not you.  Oh, yeah, you.  Really?  And then I got really excited when I saw that you were going to be on Last Comic Standing, 
[02:10:00]  because I couldn't believe how funny you were, and I was like, how do I not know about this guy?  And you started here in Jersey, right?  I started.  Are we on?  Yeah, this is what we do.  Yeah, that's how we do it.  There's no free thing.  Yeah, there's no, like, there's no ladies and gentlemen from Last Comic Standing, J. London.  I'm sorry about that.  No, we all applause, you know.  Right into the flow.  Yeah.  What's your question, man?  What is the question?  Not really a question, just like.  It's an interview. 
[02:10:30]  I know.  Well, I didn't realize you started, like, in the New York area, Jersey and all that, right?  No, I basically started in a predominantly minority-like stages, situations.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Hmm.  What?  What do you mean by that, sir?  No, I started out in reverse.  I did a little reverse in my act.  I mean, I started out in impoverished areas.  Yeah.  I've heard rumors like you were a cab driver.  Is that true?  Yeah, right along these wonderful streets of West 57th Street. 
[02:11:00]  So you were a cab driver in Manhattan?  Because then I heard that, like, you would park your cab in front of, I don't know if this is folklore,  but I heard you used to park your cabs in front of the comedy clubs and run into your set and then run back into the cab?  Yeah, and give the person shave money off the top.  Wait, there would be people still in the cab?  Oh, yeah.  Or I would tell them to come in and you watch the show for two seconds and come back in and shave 10%.  I had my own little caravan. 
[02:11:30]  Don't cabbies make a pretty good change now?  I'm sure they do.  I mean, I did it for so long and I thought I was developing interior problems.  Really?  Yeah, really.  Like you get a little nutty driving around in that?  Well, I used to tell people where you're going, then I cut it down to where to, and then I got it down to where.  That was it?  After that.  Did anyone want to deal with it?  I like a cabbie that shuts up.  I cannot stand getting in a cab and having the guy yapping to you. 
[02:12:00]  And it doesn't happen that much in New York, but we were just in D.C., took a cab from the bus station to the hotel, and it was awful.  The guy wouldn't shut up.  I just got off a train for three hours with people that wouldn't shut up on their cell phones.  The last thing I want to hear is anybody.  And this guy's just, oh, yeah, that's a nice hotel.  So, what are you doing down here?  Oh, killing cabbies.  Shut up.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's nerves on his part.  Yeah, they just talk to everybody. 
[02:12:30]  They don't shut up.  That's nerves on his part.  Is it?  Yeah, nerves.  Nerves?  Yes.  I know the condition.  Really?  Maybe he's trying to be popular and friendly and get more tips.  That's what he's trying to do.  And you know something?  I'll tip you more if you just shut up.  Yeah.  Yeah, I can look at it that way.  That's it.  Take my bag out of your trunk.  Put it on the curb.  I don't want to hear a word from him.  I don't even want to know what nationality is.  He's trying to humanize himself.  Yeah.  It's kind of like Catherine Martin.  It's a little bit harder to not tip somebody once you've bonded with him.  Eh, you know.  Ah, no. 
[02:13:00]  And you've been at this comedy thing for a real long time, right?  Ah, I'm on my, ah, basically my 20th year.  Wow.  Yeah.  Non-stop.  And then you finally hit with the last comic standing.  I mean...  Ah, I've been trying to hit a long time.  Yeah, I understand.  There's no...  But they're calling you probably an overnight sensation, right?  No, but there's no...  Even though you put 20 years into the business.  I'm very good into empathy, so I don't want to look for empathy here.  It was a nice road.  And as Jim, as Mr. Norton can attest to in the world of the murkiness part, of the aspect. 
[02:13:30]  You're getting good gigs, though, from the show?  I've traveled all over the countries, crisscrossing this wonderful nation of ours.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And has your price gone up?  Are you getting better gigs now from last time standing?  All these four...  I worked prime time clubs.  I worked clubs where it was sort of dingy, and if it was out of town, it was real dingy-like.  Can I tell you a story that takes 10 seconds?  Oh, that is fine.  Too much.  Too much.  All right, go ahead. 
[02:14:00]  No, talk just about a cab, because to me, that was a funny...  About luggage.  Yeah.  I stayed at this four-star hotel, very Renoir-like, and I had my luggage, and it broke, and I like  to just take my food out of the club and go right to my room and watch TV and devour the  food as watching TV, and the garbage started to collect, because I don't want the lady  to keep ringing every morning, you know, and I make sure it's clean, so I kept taking a  pile of garbage and putting it in the luggage, and then I went out Sunday to get rid of the  luggage, and then the canister was closed, so I went to a Starbucks, and I left it there, 
[02:14:30]  and I'm trying to find luggage in Coconut Grove, and I come back, and they caught off the  area.  They thought it was a bomb inside the luggage.  There's so many things right there.  You took your luggage.  Wait, let's...  By luggage, you mean your suitcase?  Yes, sir.  And you put your room service or your garbage from the food that you'd bring up to your room.  Yes, sir.  You then took that garbage and put it in your luggage.  Yes, sir. 
[02:15:00]  Why?  I don't know.  Why wouldn't you put it in the garbage pail?  And wear your clothes at this point.  Yeah.  No, I had to try to find another piece of luggage.  So his clothes are still in the room.  He figures he'll just throw away his luggage with the garbage and then go out and buy more  luggage.  Yeah, and walk...  Or you're just dumping out the garbage.  I was trying to get rid of the garbage, and then I...  They were cutting off the area.  The dumpster was closed, and you couldn't dump it.  If you were able to dump the garbage out of your luggage, would you have brought your 
[02:15:30]  luggage back and packed your clothes in the...  It's exactly what I did.  That's the point I'm bringing up.  Oh, it is, because...  It is.  He had to...  I'm just...  I'm very...  I'm very childish.  Wow.  Aren't your clothes damaged by the...  No.  You are a pisser.  He's a weirdo.  Yeah.  I mean...  Couldn't you get Ramone?  That was very obvious.  You get the garbage out?  That was very obvious in Last Comic Standing.  You had some rituals, and you had kind of this loner thing happening. 
[02:16:00]  And then you had those books with your jokes in it that no one could read.  Right.  I remember seeing it on Last Comic Standing.  Right, and Extravagant.  Kind of like the Beautiful Mind riding.  Oh, that crazy person, real small riding.  Yeah, neurotic, skitzy, neurotic.  Yeah.  All right.  I got you.  But it treated me well.  Did the hotel give you a discount?  What, Jessica?  I was just wondering if the hotel gave him a discount.  No, it's just that I came back with the luggage, and I wrapped it up.  It was just...  I don't know why I brought it up here.  No, that's the perfect stuff to bring up. 
[02:16:30]  And so they taped off the area thinking it was a bomb.  They cordoned it off.  Yes, they did, sir.  And then you had to go down and say, no, it's my garbage-filled luggage.  I said, it's my room service remnants, officer.  Right.  Send the bomb squad home.  Right.  And also the fact that I still, through my own demise, left my name and information inside the tag.  Oh, inside the tag on the luggage.  So they opened it.  Imagine just opening up a bag and finding garbage in there. 
[02:17:00]  This garbage belongs to?  Yeah.  Exactly.  That's all.  Just a story.  That's a great story.  Is there any other weird little things you do on the road or in your personal life?  No, very just...  When they showed your apartment in L.A., I felt bad for you.  No, I still feel bad because that apartment still lives.  That's right.  There was nothing in it.  And I have not much in my apartment.  That's the point.  That's the point.  But now it is.  It's become a warehouse of activities.  Yeah.  You got mice or anything?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  The place is too small for mice. 
[02:17:30]  Really?  Yeah.  It's just a little box and there was no real furniture or anything.  It's not even a bachelor.  It's a bachelorette.  But now the whole sexual...  The whole rooming area will change.  Next.  You're making more money though now, right?  Yeah.  So what do you do with your money?  Hoard.  I do hoard.  You don't really...  You don't spend...  You don't spend...  Oh, I do.  I've gotten clothes now.  I do pamper myself.  Yeah.  More in the food area.  Dude, when you're done with room service, why don't you just put the garbage can outside  the room? 
[02:18:00]  If you don't want the maids knocking on the door, just put it in the garbage can.  You got like three garbage cans to put out to the room.  You know, because I feel so bad for them.  I know how hard they work.  So instead, inconvenience the entire box squad of a city.  You know, we rarely ask our comedians to perform because we'd rather you just...  You just kind of hang stuff.  Right.  But man, I would love to see you just do a few...  Can we maybe set up an audience for you today?  Like interns and stuff?  And we'll have chairs and then you can do maybe like two minutes? 
[02:18:30]  Sure.  Anything to pump up sales.  I know it sounds really weird.  I know it sounds really weird, Anthony.  Anything to pump up sales.  But his act is so unique and different.  And I know if we got a little audience that I think it could kind of work today.  I really do.  Just maybe two or three minutes.  Just a few.  Sure.  We'll even...  Maybe we'll have Steve and his imaginary friend Ramon be the emcee and we'll introduce you.  And you can even come walking through the door.  Do you want to give this a try?  I'll try it.  Why not?  It's, you know, it's... 
[02:19:00]  We rarely do this because usually like most comedians on a radio show doing their act is  like, eh, whatever.  Right.  But yours is so unique and different.  I think it could work.  I really do.  Surely I'll try that.  All right.  You want to try that?  Sure.  And where are you playing this weekend?  I'm playing at the club here.  It's basically...  Caroline's?  Yes.  Every jealous eye of comedy wishes to get into.  I will be at Caroline's to see Jay London.  Oh.  So it's starting tonight?  Oh, yeah.  At 8 o'clock.  So Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Are you doing a Sunday show?  Yes.  Yes.  All right.  Is it just you or there's more or less comedy? 
[02:19:30]  No, there's the great Gary Goldman and then there's another act that's going to fulfill  time.  It's all about...  I highly recommend if you want to see something different and you didn't really see Last Comic  Standing that you see Jay London.  I just...  I think you're just awesome.  I really, really do.  What did you think of Jay Moore as the host?  Straight shooter.  Straight shooter.  Apparently not with his wife.  Why would you...  I don't...  I'm reading things.  They're saying he's dating Nikki Cox. 
[02:20:00]  Dating Nikki Cox now.  From Vegas.  He is?  Yeah.  Going out to the Super Bowl with her.  He is, man.  Because, you know...  Jay loves Cox.  Well, the point is that I, you know, from my understanding and interacting with Jay Moore,  good guy, great wife, good guy, great wife, beautiful kid.  Yeah, we were a little surprised when we read that, too.  You know, he always came on and doted about his wife.  Had her on the show a few times.  Seemed happy enough. 
[02:20:30]  He may be going through a tumultuous period.  He may have been going through it five years ago when he was getting blowjobs in our bathroom.  Who am I to say?  So that's called a tumultuous time.  Who am I to say, though?  Let's not forget Chocolate.  Chocolate.  The black whore from Uptown.  That we saw him banging in the ass in another studio.  Wait, dude.  That was...  Didn't we actually see the banging?  I know what I saw, but there were different...  Where's Ben?  Because Ben swears he saw it, too.  Because there were, like, a reflection in the window, and I don't know if Jay...  He's an actor, so I don't know if he was acting or something. 
[02:21:00]  Look, she was an awfully dark woman, and it was dark in the studio.  I'm not saying...  He could have been banging air, Anthony.  I'm not saying he was doing that.  I'm saying what I saw looked like that, but I'm not saying I saw that.  Ben...  No way.  What do you want to or not want to say about...  Ben, Ben, grab that microphone.  What are you talking about?  I was in the restroom.  I didn't...  I missed some of this.  Jay Moore and Chocolate.  Oh, yeah.  You saw it, too.  Oh, yeah.  I remember those two brothers that were cheering them on, like, yeah! 
[02:21:30]  I will go on record and say I really don't know what I saw.  I don't know.  I know it was...  It looked bad for Jay, but I really don't know what I saw.  Our other radio station that we were at here in New York, and it was through double-paned  soundproof glass, so I don't know.  The lights were down low.  You ever look through a prism, and things look all separated and weird, so perhaps he  wasn't even near her.  There you go.  And then looking through that weird window, he's right on top of her.  We really don't know, right, Anthony? 
[02:22:00]  I don't know.  I don't know, but apparently things, you know, have happened since then.  I think he's having some issues now, and the whole Nikki Cox thing coming out in the paper.  Yeah, it was a little weird.  He's got a fine, fine, full-essence woman.  Right!  Right.  Yeah, Nicole.  Well, whatever.  She's a beautiful girl.  I can't get involved in that.  I can't get involved in that.  No worries.  Ben, we're setting this up as a comedy club, because I'm telling you, Jay's going to do  like two or three minutes.  Eric, set up this place as a comedy club. 
[02:22:30]  Get the interns.  I'm dead serious.  What's the interns, Eric?  Everyone's going to sit in a chair and watch Jay London for like four minutes.  Are they going to charge us ridiculous amounts of money for drinks?  Set it up like a comedy club.  They're the Opie and Anthony show.  Jay, Jesus.  Yeah.  Seriously.  Yeah, get rid of the couch.  Set up chairs.  Jay will be in this corner over here.  We want to do this immediately, so.  Jay London is in studio.  He's playing Caroline this weekend. 
[02:23:00]  How is he going to stand under the TV?  That's all right.  I can do that.  Yeah.  He's got to be next to the TV.  Well, where do you want to stand, Jay?  You're the comedian.  Right under the TV.  Or right in front of the TV?  It's good comedy.  Right under it.  Right under it.  Yeah.  As Regis is on.  So then they decide what they.  I prefer him.  Henry Winkler.  Yeah.  The Fonz.  Yeah, simply because.  Oh, they're on the Happy Days set today, Anthony.  It's 30 years.  30 years.  Yeah, they're having a reunion show, which is just what we need, is a Happy Days reunion  show.  My life hasn't been complete.  He's become a full-fledged actor, hasn't he? 
[02:23:30]  Irving Winkler.  Well, Henry Winkler.  We were talking about this in.  Irving Winkler.  Henry Winkler.  We were talking about this in the office.  The guy has spent a lot more time in his career away from Happy Days as he did in Happy Days.  And he's directed, produced, and done some acting.  Yet they always say Henry Winkler, also known as the Fonz.  It's just one of those things he is so saddled with and stuck with for the rest of his life,  no matter what else he does.  You know, and Richie Cunningham, the same thing. 
[02:24:00]  He's done some brilliant stuff since being Richie Cunningham, but he'll always be Richie Cunningham.  He really will.  That sounds so sad.  It kind of is sad, because some people don't get over that.  Is that where drugs come in?  Drugs will come into play.  Perhaps a 38 to the forehead will come into play with some of these people.  Will always be the dopey shock jocks that had a couple of sex in St. Pat's Cathedral.  They remember you for one thing. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, they pick one big event.  I think that's our thing.  One big mistake.  That's going to be our thing.  And they're going to remember Jay London from Last Comic Standing.  Last Comic Standing.  I'll be remembered.  Well, hopefully, maybe.  Are you one of those stand-up comics that would like a sitcom?  No.  No?  I just did King of Queens, to tell you the truth.  Yes, I did.  How was that?  Fun?  As they said in Goodfellas, can I use that language?  Sure.  He broke his cherry.  I broke my cherry.  You broke your cherry.  Your sitcom cherry.  Were you playing a character that was a little far removed from who you really are? 
[02:25:00]  Not that far.  Not that far?  No.  Yeah?  A bloated me.  It was a bloated you.  A bloated me.  Oh, look at this.  They're bringing in a professional mic stand and everything.  Hey, Eric, why isn't everyone helping you?  We need, like, literally ten chairs in here.  Like, right away.  Get ten chairs set up.  Where's Noah?  Look at Noah right here.  Get all the chairs from the office and what have you.  What is Noah directing the operation?  And bring that over here.  All right.  You know what we could do as they set up the studio for Jay Moore? 
[02:25:30]  We have Jessica in the studio.  Jay Moore?  I mean, Jay London.  I got Jay Moore on the brain.  Sorry, Jay.  Jay London.  Jay Les.  We got Jessica in the studio that does dirty songs.  You could, like, maybe warm up for Jay London.  Do you do dirty songs or?  Yeah.  Dirty.  You look, you don't look the part of a dirty songstress.  Yeah, I know.  Kind of a very innocent look to you.  Oh, thanks.  There you go.  Yeah.  Very sweet.  And it doesn't seem like the type of girl that would, you know, have filth coming out  of you like that.  Yeah.  You know, it comes in all forms.  It certainly does.  It's very surprising.  Good for you. 
[02:26:00]  Well, thank you.  If you're not going to be too distracted as they set up our comedy club, know what's  going to be great, Anthony?  One day, all these cubicles are going to be gone.  Yeah.  And they'll just be set up for someone like Jay London.  We'll have a stage.  And then we just take the whole show outside the studio and we're ready to go.  And we get a nice performance from somebody.  He wants the dead weight is shipped out to a new facility?  Hey, Bruce, when is the dead weight getting removed from here?  The dead weight?  Yeah, the dead weight.  Who are you referring to?  You may call them other XM employees.  Yeah, we call them dead weight. 
[02:26:30]  When are they leaving?  Oh, I don't know.  There's no...  There's rumors that it could be soon, right?  Probably not that soon.  I believe it is not high up on the radar at the moment.  When is the box car coming through so we could shove them on it and send them out?  I'm afraid it's not going to happen until, oh, geez, end of the summer maybe.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding?  Now it's end of the summer?  Now it's end of summer.  They were telling us March, I think, right?  Low priority now.  Well, you know, they've got to sign the lease first.  And I do not believe there is a signed lease.  And then you've got to build a place.  And that's a while. 
[02:27:00]  Can't we just squat somewhere?  And they've got to pry their cold, dead fingers from the desk over there.  Well, can't we just push their cubicles to, like, one side of this place?  And then we'll take over this half over here?  Yeah, we need a performance area in there.  We need something in there people can perform in.  Let's see.  Who's expendable?  Oh, my God.  Who isn't?  All of them.  Exactly.  Start with him.  What does he do?  We don't know what that person does, Bruce.  Russ?  I'm not naming names.  Oh, so you think Russ doesn't do anything around here, huh?  Is that what you're saying, Bruce?  No, he's a program director for two channels. 
[02:27:30]  He does a lot of work.  What channels?  Beyond Jazz, which is the electric jazz channel.  Actually, Russ has been very cool to us since we got here.  And Audio Visions, the Earth song or the New Age.  New Age.  New Age.  New Age.  New Age action.  New Age.  He's been very cool to us ever since we started.  I didn't know that was Russ.  It's the other people we're talking about.  So he gets on Schindler's list?  He's able to stay when the boxcars come and haul everyone else in?  Well, he has little small fingers.  They're good for cleaning out the munitions.  I am essential to the Opie and Anthony efforts. 
[02:28:00]  Russ is the big dude.  Russ is huge.  Yeah, Russ is all right.  How's the comedy?  Wow, it's getting set up quite nicely.  Yeah, we're going to move all the chairs back so Jay London has some room.  And then we can sit around the console as well.  But we want everyone in here for Jay's little performance.  Jessica, so you do dirty songs.  You want to do one as we go to break here?  Sure.  What's your deal?  Well, I'm a comedian too.  Okay.  And I perform around the city. 
[02:28:30]  And I wrote some songs.  And it's very hard for me to find places to perform because I swear in all my songs I can't send it to a regular radio station.  Yeah.  So I can send it to you guys.  You can send it to Hot 97.  That's for sure.  Send it there.  They don't care what they play.  Yeah.  I was thinking about that afterwards.  I was like, shit.  Tsunami song.  It's so easy.  Oh, well.  Anyway.  All right.  Well, this is a song that I wrote. 
[02:29:00]  It's called The Nipples Are the Clits of My Tits.  Wait, wait, wait.  What is it called?  It's called My Nipples Are the Clits of My Tits.  You have to understand, I don't wake up until two most days.  My Nipples Are the Clits of My Tits.  Gotcha.  Right?  Very nice.  It's common sense, you know.  We can all learn something from this song.  It goes like this.  Well, you heard of the clit.  It's in the middle of it. 
[02:29:30]  This thing.  But did you know, friends, that my nipples are clits?  The clits are my tits.  The clits are my tits.  Now, listen.  When you're coming near my vagina or rear, you don't all forget.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[02:30:00]  So remember then, dear, that my nipples are clits.  Everyone.  The clits are my tits.  Got my lighter out.  Ring the bells of sex and sex smells.  It's gross.  High toned intensity.  Two, three, four.  Selfish propensity. 
[02:30:30]  That's the guys.  Man in a boat.  How does he stay afloat?  Pinkish brown islands are waiting up on high hands.  You better go get them the fat chunk of meat.  Raised above my soft teat is a sweet, tender treat.  And it's good enough to eat.  So remember then, dear, that my nipples are clits. 
[02:31:00]  Everyone.  The clits are my tits.  The clits are my tits.  That's it.  Okay, terrific.  Noah wrote that, by the way.  That was another composition.  I'm hoping Noah has another song we can play.  Noah.  That's very interesting. 
[02:31:30]  Interesting.  That's a nice word.  Thank you.  You play real well, and you've got a very nice singing voice, too.  Oh, thank you.  All right.  Okay, we've got a freak show in here today.  When we come back from break, we'll get another song out of you.  And when we come back, it's going to be Jay London.  Yes.  I mean, I think you're the first comedian we've ever asked to actually do some of his stuff on the show.  I hope it's a resounding victory.  What?  I hope it's a resounding victory.  Okay.  You have to talk into the show.  I know, but we don't have anyone really producing the show today, so. 
[02:32:00]  I hope it's a resounding victory.  Yeah.  How's the house look?  How's the house look?  Are we packing out?  You'll be packing out.  We went to ready.  Does it look good?  What do we got, one person sitting down over there?  Noah?  All right, why don't we take a break?  One androgynous oddball sitting in there.  Yeah, give me a longer sweeper so we can get the studio set for Jay London, who's playing  Caroline's all this weekend, Anthony.  Yep.  And I highly recommend you go see him, okay?  We'll continue.  Thank you.  Huh? 
[02:32:30]  What?  Waiting, waiting, waiting.  Hit it.  What kind of a show are you guys putting on here today?  Cancel all the blankets.  Welcome to Radio Free America.  America's ready.  I'm ready.  I want a million voices crying out in the wilderness.  Jesus, let's get serious.  Now, take a deep cleansing breath.  And begin.  Fix it, fix it. 
[02:33:00]  Jesus bag.  I'm over here now.  Bagbooking.  Nice cake, freak.  Bag.  Baggot.  Jesus bag.  Oh, man.  Bagbooking.  I don't believe it.  Stupid.  You're so stupid.  Guess who's bag.  Guess who's bag.  Bagbooking.  Guess who's bag.  So afraid.  Oh, my gosh.  Guess who's bag.  Hey.  Guess who's bag.  Guess who's bag.  Guess who's bag.  Guess who's bag.  Guess who's bag. 
[02:33:30]  Guess who's bag.  Guess who's bag.  Guess who's bag.  Shit.  Oh, man.  If I was older, I would totally start jacking up right now.  What is all doing?  We're going to have a problem here.  This looks like a job for me.  So, everybody, just follow me.  Because we need a little hope.  Hey, Anthony.  Because it feels so empty without me.  I'm saying this looks like a job for me.  So, everybody, just follow me.  Because we need a little hope.  Hey, Anthony.  Because it feels so empty without me.  Hey, Anthony. 
[02:34:00]  Okay, cut.  Here we go.  Hold your ears, folks.  It's showtime.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The Anthony Show.  XM 202.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony program. 
[02:34:30]  We're going to try something a little different today.  We've got Jay London in studio from Last Comic Standing.  Yes.  Playing Carolines all this weekend.  I highly recommend you go see Jay.  We have set up the studio like a comedy club.  No, it's not the studio, Opie.  We're going to be throwing it to our comedy lounge that we have here in our building.  All right.  And what's the name of this place?  I don't know.  I can tell you this much.  The shades are down. 
[02:35:00]  It's nice and dark in here.  We've got the dimmers on the lights way down.  We've got pretty much everyone that works with the show in here.  And we're ready to do a little thing here.  This is great.  How about we'll never be willing to give Jimmy time?  That'll be good.  Even if you have, let's say, a Leno thing coming up, you can't even get five minutes.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Let's call it the Gotham shithole.  That'll be a nice name for this club.  Hope it burns down while it's full on New Year's Eve.  Fuckhead. 
[02:35:30]  This is, we were talking during the break.  This is the first time we've actually asked a comedian to do his act on our show.  And we set up the place nice, I think.  We got an emcee slash intern that's going to do some time.  Are we going to have some music for the emcee to come up to?  Because usually at the comedy club, the music starts, and then you get the club announcement  kind of a thing, and then the emcee comes up.  Now you're emcee Nathaniel, you know, something like that.  Let's see.  It's got to be some bad, maybe 80s or something techno or... 
[02:36:00]  Well, let's ask Nathaniel.  Tell them your plane joke.  Nathaniel, what song do you want to come up to?  I don't know.  Yeah, it is always some awful dated music.  Yeah, it wouldn't be Nathaniel's music.  It would be the house music that the club has.  You know, that's what they bring the emcee up to.  How about maybe some Motley Crue?  Something like that.  Spice Girls.  Would work.  All right, we'll find something.  Get this...  All right, let's turn it down.  All right, that's good.  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Opie and Anthony's. 
[02:36:30]  Okay, let's hear it, people.  Wait, but you're...  Yay!  Wait, but you're Anthony.  Yeah.  Shouldn't we have Martini Steven and his imaginary friend Ramon do it?  But it's always some bad recorded thing, isn't it?  All right.  From 57th.  57th.  All right, all right.  The Crossroads of the World.  Hold on.  Turn off the music.  All right.  Okay, you're right, Anthony.  Are you ready?  I'm sorry.  You're right.  Crossroads of the World.  Crossroads of the World.  All right, relax. 
[02:37:00]  You're serving wings and hearing dick jokes.  All right, so you want to start the music thing, go to you?  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, Anthony's got a hold of this.  Okay, here we go.  But, Derek, if you will, let's start it up here.  Ladies and gentlemen, from the most important place on earth, it's Opie and Anthony's, the  Crossroads of the World.  Ladies and gentlemen, your emcee for this evening, Nathaniel. 
[02:37:30]  Let's hear it for us.  Thank you.  Thanks a lot, people.  Wow, and I can't laugh.  Thank you.  Daniel!  Yes!  Yes!  O-N-A!  O-N-A, dick!  O-N-A ruled, you dick!  Yes, thank you.  The big yellow one's the sun!  Can't hear you back here. 
[02:38:00]  Louder!  Be more funny!  Assholes!  Hi.  Thanks.  Thanks for coming to O-N-A's place tonight.  Day.  Before we start, I just want to remind everybody to turn off your cell phones, or put them on  Vibrate, or your beepers.  But who has beepers nowadays?  Everybody does that intro, sorry.  I had to make fun of it. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, beepers are so dated.  Yeah, so is the joke.  So, yeah, how's it going, everybody?  Everybody having a good time tonight?  Yeah!  All right.  I'll do a couple of my mediocre jokes, and then bring on the main event.  So, I'm a wasp, in case you guys didn't know.  I'm from a very waspy place, Connecticut.  The motto for our local country club is, we will have a Jew by the year 2015.  All right.  I'm not sure if that means they will have a Jewish member, or if they will have captured 
[02:39:00]  one.  Monster rain!  Thank you, sir.  Yeah, I miss the sounds of somebody crowing like a bird through my whole set.  That happened.  Yeah.  Ah, good enough.  My town also has a very small black community as well, or as we refer to it, Carl. 
[02:39:30]  Hell, I'm killing, so I'm just going to bring up the main event right there.  Oh, one more joke.  More!  Come on, you faggot!  All right.  Jeez.  Yeah.  It was a crowd word.  The ONA fans are always cheering one more joke from the non-Jim Norton entity.  All right.  What are you trying to touch there, Colby?  I'm sorry.  Yeah, I get really annoyed when people take really obvious stands on bad issues, like, 
[02:40:00]  oh, the tsunami sucks, or, you know, cancer's terrible.  So, I like to mess with them.  You know, somebody actually told me, oh, I think kiddie porn's just awful.  I was like, I know, the lighting is awfully unflattering.  Oh, man, I repeated the word in the joke just like Jim told me not to do.  I used awfully twice.  Anyway, now that I have you, oh, yeah, worked up to a fever pitch, I just want to say that  if you're in Pittsburgh this weekend, make sure you check out the improv, 412-462-5233, 
[02:40:30]  if you want to get sick of it.  That was a fine ending to your set.  Thank you.  Everybody's going crazy.  All right.  And now, your headliner tonight.  Are you ready for your headliner?  Oh, yeah.  I'm sorry.  Are you guys ready for your headliner, Jay London?  Huh?  Oh, come on.  You guys could do better than that.  I always say that.  You guys could do better than that.  All right.  Here he is from Last Comic Standing, Jay London.  Jay London. 
[02:41:00]  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Do I need earphones?  No.  No.  It's a pleasure to be here tonight at the world-famous O&A Club, conveniently located on  wherever.  I called up 1-800-ALARM-ME today, and they told me I had six months to live.  I like that.  One Christmas, my father bought me a train set with a third rail.  So, I'm a hit so far. 
[02:41:30]  Great.  I just came back from a Polish funeral procession held at night, and we all had our headlights  off, and we got into three accidents.  I'm killing on the seventh floor.  That's right.  I just came back from a sympathy card convention, and words can't explain.  This is bad.  If anybody has to go to the bathroom or use their cell phone, this would be the right 
[02:42:00]  time.  Did I tell you I met Michael Jackson?  Did I tell you that?  No.  I told him to lighten up.  Oh, is that bad?  But, you know, what are you going to do?  I'm here all week.  Yeah, sure.  I want to do a one-man show, but I'm afraid somebody else is going to show up.  I have multiple personalities, so tonight we'll be speaking in the first person.  I went public today.  I couldn't hold it in. 
[02:42:30]  I went public today.  I couldn't hold it in.  Yeah.  I'm not done yet.  Hold on.  One second.  I'm looking for a vitamin to supplement my income.  You got that?  I'm looking for a vitamin.  Okay.  And now, I don't know if this is a sex-based club here, if they talk in that tone, but  I went out with a very popular girl.  She has gridlock signs leading up to a bedroom door. 
[02:43:00]  And I blocked a box, and it cost me $60 and two points on my license.  That's brilliant.  All right.  And my closing line is here right now.  My girlfriend told me I was history.  I told her to change the subject.  I found out I aroused one thing in women's suspicion.  Do you get that?  And the last thing, I'm actually trying to quit pot, so I got the pot patch, and I keep 
[02:43:30]  it in the backyard.  It means I grow it myself.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Ladies and gentlemen, Jay London.  I want to call a joke.  Can I call one?  A comic has just walked in the club and wants some time.  Oh, a special treat for everybody.  Just one?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Jessica Delfino? 
[02:44:00]  Yeah?  Oh, you won't get through that way.  Where are you going?  Just trying to work her way up to the stage.  Keep it going, people.  Come on.  We all love more comedy.  Okay.  Here's my one joke for the evening, the day.  Okay, so I'm 28 years old, and I'm really excited because I'm going to be 29 this year.  But I thought I was supposed to stop getting pimples by now, but I got one, and it made me  nervous because it was, like, on my face but also on my lip, you know, so I got worried  that maybe it wasn't a pimple at all. 
[02:44:30]  Maybe it was herpes, you know, because, like, it just looked remarkably identical to the  sores on my vagina, and so I was really scared.  That should have gotten more.  That actually deserved more than it got.  That really was, yeah.  Well, it's a tough room.  Tough room.  It is a tough room.  If anyone want to close the show out, all right, thank you, everybody, for coming down  tonight.  Let's hear for our other acts, Jessica Delfino and Jay London. 
[02:45:00]  Don't forget.  I've got one.  Don't forget to tip your waitresses.  Wait, wait, what?  Do you have a joke?  It's a joke joke, but my, I actually, my nephew told me this.  All right, you've got to get up on stage.  I know you're in front of a mic.  Oh, another treat.  Wait, another surprise.  Jim Norton, everybody.  Wow.  Imagine the shock and awe of the crowd when they go, wow, we just came here for a show,  and Jimmy Norton's performing.  This is a joke my nephew told me.  All right.  There's this guy, and he's out one night in a bar, and he's trying to meet a girl to  take home, but he can't meet anyone.  So he finally meets this much older woman. 
[02:45:30]  She's in her mid to late 60s, and he's not into older women, but he's like, ah, I've had  a few drinks.  Why not?  So he goes home with her, and they start fooling around, and he takes off her bra, and he starts  touching her breasts, and he starts to suck her breasts, and all of a sudden, he's sucking  her nipple, and liquid shoots into his mouth.  He goes, ah, that's a little odd, and he swallows it, and they're kissing a little bit more,  and he sucks the other breast, and he sucks the nipple, and more liquid goes into his  mouth, and he's kind of getting turned on by that. 
[02:46:00]  So after they're done having sex, he goes, you know, I really enjoyed that, and I was  sucking her breast, and I mean, not to be disrespectful, but I thought you were a little  too old to give milk, and she sighed, and she went, I am, but unfortunately, I'm not  too old to have cancer, and if you want more of that type of humor, make sure you go down 
[02:46:30]  to the Improv at Pittsburgh, 412-462-5233.  Don't forget to tip your waitresses, ha, ha.  Yes, I think the debut of the ONA Comic Club was a hit.  That was great.  Make sure to hold on to your tickets now when you leave, so we can make sure you've paid  your tab.  Very good.  That was great.  Felt like I was really in a club.  Not bad.  We'll make some improvements in the place, but that was pretty good, man.  We gotta get, like, a fake brick wall that we just hang up. 
[02:47:00]  The real hack-like atmosphere.  Yeah, we'll get a brick wall for the next time we do this.  You should just get, like, a screen brick wall that you can just pull down.  Yeah.  Jessica, you got another song in you as we go to break, maybe?  Yeah, I have another song.  All right.  We got Jay London in the studio, who just did a great job.  He's gonna be at Caroline's all weekend long.  Thanks for pumping me, man.  Thank you, thank you.  That's a little taste of what you'll hear.  No, it's great.  Funny stuff.  And now we got Jessica, who, I don't know where she came from, but she does some of  the comedy clubs in Manhattan, right? 
[02:47:30]  I'm from Maine.  From Maine, but...  I live here now.  And you're trying to make it in comedy, right?  Yeah, actually, I'd like to be a writer.  Okay.  Ideally.  All right.  But, okay, this is a quick song.  It's a war protest song, because it's timely, right?  I hate war.  And everyone, you know, hates war, but...  Well, not everyone.  Well, yeah, you're right.  People actually enjoy it, yeah.  Some people get a kick out of it, but...  Okay, this is a war protest song.  And I played it at the war protests. 
[02:48:00]  I actually went to the war protests and played it.  Good place to play a war protest, I'm sure.  Yeah, and the cops really liked it a lot.  You guys like this.  One, two, three.  I'm sorry things didn't work out with us, but I'm sorry.  It's...  What time is it?  It's, um...  Eight.  Eight o'clock.  Or nine.  Nine.  Nine o'clock.  One, two, three.  Well, I'm sorry things didn't work out with us, but I'm leaving here.  I can't play the song.  Okay.  What?  It's a very awkward situation.  I know.  Am I bringing the awkwardness to the place? 
[02:48:30]  No, it's not...  It's not you.  It's me.  Oh.  It's just early.  Okay.  One, two, three.  I'm sorry things didn't work out with us, but I'm leaving here tonight on midnight bus.  Keep my shit, I don't care.  Just please don't make a fuss.  You don't lick my pussy.  Right.  I tried to help you figure it out.  I spread my crossbar open till my clit popped out.  I pushed your head left, right, and all about.  But you don't lick my pussy.  Right.  I heard you say, I heard you say, yesterday I didn't give you half a chance, but we dated 
[02:49:00]  for a year.  Oh, my dear.  Oh, my dear.  Good pussy licking is the key to romance.  Oh, I'm sorry things didn't work out with us, but I'm leaving here tonight on the midnight  bus.  Keep all my shit.  Keep all my shit, I don't care.  Just please don't make a fuss.  You don't lick my pussy right, I know.  You don't lick my pussy right one more time.  Oh, you don't lick my pussy right.  No more war, you guys. 
[02:49:30]  No more war.  There you go.  That's the war message.  Yeah.  Jessica.  You got a website or anything?  I do.  It's jessydelfino.blogspot.com.  Just Google Jessica Delfino if you're curious.  But, yeah.  Oh, I have a band, too.  It's called Haunted Pussy.  What?  Haunted Pussy.  Haunted Pussy is my histrionic fear metal band.  And in my histrionic fear metal band, I don't tell jokes or sing dirty songs. 
[02:50:00]  I do a lot of screaming.  And we have two lead singers, like Hart and the other lead singer, gets topless all the time.  Really?  So the guys really dig that.  I don't get topless, but there's a story behind it, Haunted Pussy.  It's a story about being raped by a ghost.  And it's a beautiful story of triumph.  You guys are looking at me.  No, I absolutely agree.  I want to play a little taste of Haunted Pussy. 
[02:50:30]  You want to taste some Haunted Pussy?  Yeah.  I think the first song is the story of Haunted Pussy.  All right.  Is it a long ballad?  No.  None of the songs are very long.  They're all very, uh, very kind of...  Is it serious?  Uh, not so serious.  I mean, it's not, it's not really jokey, you know?  It's just, like, kind of weird.  All right.  Anthony?  Yes?  A little taste of Haunted Pussy.  All right.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone. 
[02:51:00]  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  You got me on that one.  Yeah, me too.  You absolutely got me.  I was expecting to hear some Haunted Pussy, and we got banana phone.  Do you really want to hear Haunted Pussy?  Maybe after the break.  You should play.  We've got to take a break.  Yeah, we've got to take a break, though.  It's filthy.  Banana phone.  Jesus Christ, that banana phone song.  All right.  I like that song.  Isn't that catchy?  It is.  Well, banana phone.  You'll be singing that all night.  You guys have fun here.  Yeah, it's great, right?  We're having a great time.  We've been featuring the interns a lot today, so intern Danny threw this thing together, 
[02:51:30]  Anthony, as we go to break.  The reporter that fell down and hurt herself as she was squashing the grapes.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah.  And Danny took that audio of her, like, I don't know.  She knocked the wind out of herself, obviously.  Yeah.  And he came up with this.  Oh, I can't breathe. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, stop.  Oh, stop.  Oh, it's everything. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, I can't breathe.  Live from Mardi Gras.

[02:53:30]  Or go to opiananthony.com.  XM202.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Give me fuel, give me fire, give me double time as I.  We got a lot going on today.  Jessica's singing her songs over there. 
[02:54:00]  We got Jay London over here from Last Comic Standing.  He's going to be at Caroline's all weekend long.  I'm going to that show, man.  I can't wait to see Jay London.  Oh, thanks.  A little Jimmy Norton in the studio who's taking off today for Pittsburgh.  Yes, he is.  And on the phone, if I can get to the phone, who's coming in tomorrow in lieu of Jimmy Norton?  It will be a big show tomorrow.  Club Soda Kenny will be filling in for Jim Norton tomorrow.  Are you kidding me? 
[02:54:30]  Rich Voss was not available, so we had to go to the bullpen.  That is one thin bullpen.  We had to go to the pitcher that kind of just sits on the bench all season.  Because there's no one else to get in the game.  Hey, I love Kenny.  He actually plays first base during the season, but we ran out of pitchers.  It's like a Paul O'Neill thing.  He's going to throw one ball and pull his arm out.  I love Kenny, but as far as being the third man here on staff, that's going to be rough. 
[02:55:00]  He'll be good, I think.  Well, we used Bob Kelly yesterday, so his arm's a little tired.  And Patrice, I don't know.  He's playing for so many teams, I don't even know if he's in the stadium.  I just picture me and Opie talking punctuated by, I'll say.  All day long.  I hear you.  I have to agree with Opie on that one.  Why?  That's why it will be fun.  It's going to be awful tomorrow.  Sure.  Pop-tart, Opie. 
[02:55:30]  And on the phone right now, we've got to say hi to an old friend.  We haven't talked to him in a while.  It's Henry Rollins.  Henry.  How are you doing, man?  Henry.  What's going on today, buddy?  Not much.  It's 6 in the morning where I am.  Oh, you're in L.A., obviously.  No?  Yeah.  Are you at your apartment or house?  Not at the office.  Oh, because I asked that, because I think I remember last time we talked to you that you  don't really have a place of residence, really.  Yeah, I do.  I'm just not around much.  It's kind of like a place just to put your stuff as you travel the world, right? 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  I mean, I try and stay out as much as possible.  I just got back from Europe, and I'm heading off to Russia in about 10 days.  What are you going to do in Russia?  I'm going to go into Siberia, and I'm going to go on the Trans-Siberian Rail, which is  the 6,000-mile train ride.  Why are you doing that?  I think it would be interesting, and it might make for some interesting writing, and seeing  Siberia at the coldest part of the year might be something that might be memorable. 
[02:56:30]  It might be a total drag.  I don't know.  How long of a trip is it?  It's a week.  Okay, a week.  And they do this regularly, or...?  Yeah, that thing runs all year, yeah.  There's three different rail systems.  There's the Trans-Siberian, Trans-Mongolian, and something else, but this is the big one,  so I figured.  I was in Sweden the other night, and I said, now's the time, so I researched it, called  up the travel agent, and who I wear out on a regular basis for these ideas, and she  got on it.  That isn't one of those things where people kind of have made it almost touristy. 
[02:57:00]  Is it still, like, pretty harsh?  What kind of travel, I don't know, a countryman's...  Well, there's either two to a car or four to a car, you know, a train car, so you just  decide how many people you want to travel with.  And the train lets you off, you know, every few hours for a while to go check out a different  town.  And I know a girl years ago who did it, said it was really amazing, so it got me really  curious.  Well, what are you going to see in these towns? 
[02:57:30]  Well, the locals, and probably a lot of snow and ice.  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.  I mean, it sounds kind of interesting, but you're going to be looking out the window,  seeing the exact same thing for a week straight, no?  Yeah, but, you know, so do you on your way to work.  Oh, you got me.  Well, no, no, and so do I when I'm here.  So, you know, what I'm saying is that's why I like to get out and see a different, you  know, just nine to five.  You know, it's funny.  A friend of mine went to Russia one time, and we were talking about it, and he said that 
[02:58:00]  some places are nice, but some places have, like, real poverty.  And I'm like, did you notice that?  And he's like, absolutely.  Oh, yeah, no, Russia, I've been there four times.  Russia has a lot of problems.  Yeah.  And the people are fantastic, and Stalin really did, and Stalin and communism really messed  that country up.  If you didn't like communism, you'd come out of Russia going like, yep, definitely a bad  idea.  Yeah.  But why would you live in that area now, now that Russia's trying to, like, move forward 
[02:58:30]  into the...  Well, there's opportunity if, you know, you have the keys to the kingdom.  A lot of tough guys, a lot of criminal types made a lot of money when the wall came down,  just because there's a lot of military people willing to sell pretty much anything.  And people were buying everything from submarines to every weapon known to man.  And that's a lot of weapons that we're getting hit by in Iraq are, you know, Russian-made,  you know, Kalashnikovs.  When I was in Iraq a few months ago, I saw this newly captured cache of weapons that they 
[02:59:00]  pulled off out of Syria, I guess, or they came over the Syrian border.  And it's all brand-new Russian gear, like, still packed in Greece.  Wow.  I know a guy who was...  He served over in Iraq.  He was over in...  Actually, I think in Baghdad and in Fallujah.  And he came back.  And I'm like, well, I mean, how was it?  And he's like, it was really dangerous.  And I'm like, it was.  And he's like, you bet.  Yeah.  I was there in May, and I was in a mortar attack at one base, which was a pretty dramatic 
[02:59:30]  deal.  Oh, you went over there?  Yeah.  I do a trip for the USO every three months.  And I've been to Afghanistan a couple of times, Kyrgyzstan a couple of times, Qatar, Abu  Dhabi, Dubai, Iraq, Kuwait, Honduras, places like that.  What's your take on the whole thing?  Well, my take is, are men and women in the military the best in the world?  And I'm devoted to them.  I think Iraq, the president's saying one thing, but they're actually going after something else. 
[03:00:00]  It's not really spreading freedom as much as it's putting in a roadblock against what  they think is the rising Arab unified world or something.  Is that a bad thing, in your opinion?  Um, it's, it's a bad thing when you kind of cram democracy down someone's throat.  Right.  Uh, it's a very bad thing when 1,500 of my countrymen come back dead and thousands and 
[03:00:30]  thousands come back, legs gone, faces gone.  And I'll be visiting some of them on February 12th at Walter Reed Army Hospital.  So, uh, in my opinion, uh, the freedom of all of Iraq is not worth a scraped knee of an  American soldier.  I agree with you there.  Yeah, I agree too.  I got to agree with you on that one.  I, I have a lot of problems about this conflict.  I think if they were, uh, uh, before we even gave them a second thought, I think if they  really, the people really wanted freedom and were rising up and making a concerted effort 
[03:01:00]  amongst themselves to be free and ask for the, uh, uh, uh, United States' assistance, I think  that's a different story.  My thoughts exactly.  I think they were like.  If you weren't man enough to take the guy out, then maybe you just like it that way.  There you go.  And then if they needed help to attain this freedom that they all dreamt about, then that's  a different story.  But I think the fact is they were sheep, uh, being led by a dictator with an iron fist that,  uh, you know, perhaps they didn't really want freedom. 
[03:01:30]  So why should we, uh, risk American lives to give them something they don't even understand?  I'm all into freedom and democracy and no one likes Saddam Hussein.  I mean, he's a creep, but that being said, I just see all these people coming home in  bags and that's just not worth it to me.  Especially when you meet these guys, they're just, you know, they're just people like you  and me with this completely surreal job.  I mean, the, they're nine to five over there.  It's just, it's just not, you're not able to believe what they go through.  Nope.  That's why they're so screwed up when they get back too. 
[03:02:00]  So, you know, having to deal with that, forget about it.  Uh, Jay, one of the Siberian thing, like the Bipolar Express, that show, that movie?  Uh, the Bipolar Express?  Well, it'll be bipolar when I get on it, my friend.  Okay.  I just had to break that up.  All right.  Thanks.  Uh, Henry, one other thing about Iraq.  Is it as crazy as, uh, they're showing it is on the news?  Yeah.  I mean, um, as soon as the sun goes down, you hear gunfire all night.  And, uh, wherever you go, you're in an, uh, you know, armor-plated Humvee surrounded by 
[03:02:30]  armed men.  And nowhere's really safe.  The green zone isn't safe.  I mean, every, you know, you're kind of up for grabs wherever you are there.  And the tension is pretty grim.  I mean, people are dead serious.  Like when you're out moving around, there's no, there's no joking around.  Yeah.  Like when you're in a Black Hawk, you're followed by a guard Black Hawk.  I mean, because these guys are getting shot at.  They're getting mortared all the time. 
[03:03:00]  There's a lot of the, the improvised explosive devices are very effective.  You know, and, uh, the Kevlar vests, the, the ceramic, uh, plated body armor is really  effective, but the arms keep coming off.  That's our problem.  We, the guts remain intact, but the arms go flying into the air.  Ugh.  So it's a, it's a mess.  Um.  And what about the people?  Are they, uh, do they feel like they're not going to be a mess?  Do they feel safer?  Are you seeing that or no?  Or, or are they pretty scared too?  They wouldn't let me near anybody.  I'll tell you what though.  When I was flying up from Kuwait, I was up front of the C-130 with the pilots. 
[03:03:30]  And they said, see all those lights down there?  I said, yeah.  And they said, none of that was happening when we got here.  So like, we built all of that.  There's like, uh, apparently a, a, a huge percent more electricity in Iraq than before we  were there.  It doesn't mean we necessarily, that's our job to go turn on the lights for people.  But it just shows you that when America, we're the first people you want to have help you  because we get it done.  And I've seen a lot of humanitarian aid in every one of these places I've been to. 
[03:04:00]  In, in Afghanistan and, and even in, in, in, uh, Honduras when I was there last summer.  What do you, uh, got going?  What's this shock and awe DVD thing you got?  Uh, that's, uh, it comes out like any minute now.  It's, um, from last year's tour.  Shot it, uh, in Seattle on show 51 of the tour.  And it's just a document of last year's tour.  It's just me on stage on my own, talking, uh, telling stories about, you know, where I've  just been and those shows I've been doing for about 22 years. 
[03:04:30]  And now once the tour, we, we make a DVD now.  See, that's why he goes to these places.  He gets all this info.  He goes on stage and talks about it.  Yeah, it's, uh, you're more, uh, spoken word, right?  Although there's, um, there's definitely a lot of comedy in, in what you do.  Oh, yeah, sure.  I mean, there's a lot of funny stuff.  I mean, um.  You don't want to, you don't want to, uh, commit to the comedy thing officially or what?  What, like as a stand-up?  Yeah, why not?  And have to tell dog jokes and stupid non-sequiturs.  But like, you know, but I like my wife, though, and all that kind of corny crap.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, you don't have to be a bad stand-up. 
[03:05:00]  You can just tell, you can be a good stand-up.  Richard Pryor didn't exactly do dog jokes and bad non-sequiturs.  He also spoke the truth and talked about his life, and then he did stand-up.  Yeah, Bill Hicks had a point of view with his comedy.  Yeah, absolutely.  Whether you agree or disagree.  And they're great.  But, um, uh, and I've been, I've been checking out Richard Pryor when, when you guys were like  minus eight years old.  But, um, and I, you know, those guys are heroes to me.  I just don't want to be in a comedy club being on the comedy circuit.  And when I want to talk about homophobia or something that's serious and have some guy throw his 
[03:05:30]  drink at me.  Well, you don't worry about the reaction, though.  You've got an ear.  So that's the problem there.  If you're talking about, there's definitely a risk in a comedy club, um, because you also  have to take what it is and express it and somehow find humor in the situation.  Absolutely.  I respect comics.  If someone said, go do an hour at a comedy club tonight, I'd be terrified.  And I was a homophobic child, and in kindergarten I wouldn't even skip to my loo.  And how much do you make a week doing stand-up? 
[03:06:00]  Not much.  Well, we have Jay London.  Keep working at it, because it sounds like it's working for you.  I mean, if that's your, if you walk on stage and that's your first line, I think you're  going to be eating tuna casserole for a long time.  Well, actually.  You still live with Mom, or are you moving out now?  Are you thinking about it?  Actually, we have Jay London in the studio.  He was on Last Comic Standing.  Very funny comic, actually.  He's playing Caroline's this weekend.  And then we got Jim Norton, who does the radio show with us, who's very funny.  Last Comic, what was that?  Comedy Central?  Last Comic Standing was on NBC. 
[03:06:30]  NBC, yeah.  NBC.  Oh.  Yeah, so.  Yeah.  Well, you've been all over the world.  Where's your favorite place to go?  Well, besides America, I like Australia.  Why Australia?  Just amazing country.  People are very friendly.  It's very beautiful.  Food's good.  Women are beautiful.  It's very clean.  It takes a while to get there.  Aren't they a little uptight about content?  Once you get off the plane.  Aren't they a little uptight about content?  They seem to be a bit more uptight than Americans as far as content is concerned. 
[03:07:00]  Well, there's elements of Australia that are very conservative, like here or anywhere else.  But the people are pretty fun-loving as far as...  I've been there 26 times.  And they, I don't know, they like the hard rock.  And they come to the talking shows.  And they seem to be pretty straight-up people.  Yeah.  Advice to the average man.  If they could only take one trip, where would you suggest they go? 
[03:07:30]  Gee.  For like kind of, you know, kind of a fun vacation.  You know, I mean, obviously not the Caribbean.  You know, maybe somewhere where you would never think to go.  Get an adventure.  Yeah, maybe an adventure vacation.  Egypt is pretty cool as far as like some jaws-dropping stuff to see.  You know, as far as being a tourist, everywhere you look, it's kind of mind-blowing.  I wanted to go to Egypt, but then they were saying that it's very, very dangerous now.  Ever since 2000...  Yeah, well, people were hacked up at that one tourist site. 
[03:08:00]  I forget where that was.  I tried to go right after that, but my manager talked me out of it.  But wherever you go now, like when you're at the Valley of the Kings or, you know, the Giza Pyramids, there is a bunch of young men with Uzis guarding you because that is their business is tourism.  So you're very protected.  Okay.  What was the...  There was one spoken word thing you did I caught part of.  What was the part where you were talking about something about being, like, vomiting and, like, being, like, drunk and sick, puking in the toilet or something like that? 
[03:08:30]  It's been a while, and I honestly don't remember it.  No, I've been drunk about three times in my life.  I probably threw up when I was 17 from alcohol, but I was kind of like the three Michelob, I don't like it anymore kind of guy.  So I don't know if I got any puking, drunk.  Wasn't it?  No, maybe it was you.  You were sick.  I remember something in one of your spoken word things about being sick and being wrapped around a toilet.  Oh, I was probably, at one point, I probably, usually about once a year, I just, my body kind of gives out, 
[03:09:00]  and I just shake, rattle, and roll for about 24 hours and puke and sweat.  And that was in Sweden a couple of years ago where I told a story about the article I read in the newspaper about a man who sued Starbucks  because he apparently crushed his penis inside one of the men's room toilets.  And I think that was bundled up in the same story as hugging the toilet in Sweden because I think in my vomitous reverie, 
[03:09:30]  I tried to actually recreate the accident to see how he could be litigious, and I couldn't do it.  I guess I'm just not that well gifted.  Yeah, the toilet seat slipped to the side and squished his nutsack between the toilet and the seat.  That's classic.  You know what, you can go online and actually find a lot of the legal paperwork on that.  Some girl sent it to me.  It's pretty great.  That's good reading.  Well, you know, it's interesting if you don't have a whole lot going on.  All right, let's say hi to Brad in Nashville. 
[03:10:00]  Brad, what's up?  How's it going, guys?  We got Henry Rollins on the phone.  Henry Rollins, you were listening to Richard Pryor when we were, like, minus eight years old?  How cool are you?  That nigger's crazy.  Like, my mom gave it to me when I was, like, eight or something, and my mom was pretty progressive,  and I remember I went to go see that performance film.  That was basically, you know, where that album came from, and I remember walking out of there.  Which one came from That Nigger's Crazy? 
[03:10:30]  A lot of that stuff.  Just a lot of the stuff from that Live at Sunset strip.  Just like all that classic stuff, you know, that All-American Nigger, That Nigger's Crazy.  Bicentennial Nigger, you mean?  Huh?  Bicentennial Nigger.  Bicentennial Nigger.  Not All-American Nigger.  Yeah.  I know you're saying the Live in Concert, which was filmed in Long Beach in 1979, was taken from Wanted,  which was, That Nigger's Crazy was kind of 1971 in the improv in New York City.  He filmed something called Richard Pryor Live in Smoking. 
[03:11:00]  A lot of that material eventually made its way onto That Nigger's Crazy, but it actually, not the reverse, it was true.  The CD, the tape came out years after it was actually filmed, but it came out better.  It was actually better once it was on tape than it was in the original film, which bombed.  It wasn't released until 81 by Blum Productions, because Pryor was already a star by then.  Yeah.  Well, I saw it in D.C. when I was in high school.  Henry, you know what just went on, right?  Huh?  You know what just went on?  I think you insult, like Jim Norton is probably the biggest Richard Pryor fan ever, and when 
[03:11:30]  you said that you were listening to Richard Pryor albums when we were minus eight years  old, I think it really got to him.  Oh, really?  Did I insult the guy?  No, not at all.  I just, I felt it was a bit pretentious, but no, it wasn't insulting.  No, I just, you know, I just, I'm just saying, I'm down with comics, respect comics.  Lenny Bruce, I was listening to the records before I even understood what the hell he was  talking about, and then I got older and I kind of started getting to it, but all that 
[03:12:00]  stuff, Bill Cosby, Richard Pryor, George Carlin, these guys were huge to me.  So I'm not, what I'm trying to say is I'm not in any way disrespecting comics or comedy  just because I don't go and do a thing at the comedy club.  It's these guys, you know, Lenny Bruce died for a lot of our, you know, our constitutional  rights in my opinion, and Bill Hicks was of the strength where his, such an early death  seems to me, it almost smacks of conspiracy. 
[03:12:30]  He was that effective to me, where you can almost buy the conspiracy idea that someone  just wanted to shut him up for good.  But, so all I was saying is I respect these guys.  If I, if I rubbed you the wrong way, man, I'm, I'm really, uh, well, I guess I rubbed  you the wrong way.  No, no, it was just, it was only when I, when I mentioned comedy, I asked stand-up and you're  like, oh, should I do some, like, dog jokes?  So it was kind of like, I figured that was kind of a jab at comics that I mentioned prior.  Yeah, I, I just, I would hate to be put in that box where, like, one, two, three, make 
[03:13:00]  them laugh.  Like, one time I had to do, like, a five-minute thing on, like, I don't know, uh, Penn and  Teller, they said, go out there and do five minutes.  I want, I don't know what you're, you're, I was terrified.  I said, can I do an hour?  You know, can I just be myself?  And they went, no, it's, come on, it's a show, go out there and, you know, those guys  can do it.  I, I did it, but it felt like I was a dog wearing a hat at a party.  I just felt really canned and, you know, kind of put up there. 
[03:13:30]  I really like the smoke and work thing.  I, I got a lot of your, uh, your stuff and, uh, I enjoy it.  I mean, I just would rather not have the pressure of, you know, seven seconds, bang, seven  seconds, bang.  You know, I'd rather, because a lot of stories I tell, they're, they're not funny.  I mean.  I'm a big fan of storytelling in general.  Like when Richard Pryor used to tell his stories and, uh, uh, uh, Jim Brewer, he's been on  our show a lot.  I like his storytelling.  I like Richard Pryor, Opie.  Huh?  What do you know about Pryor?  Shut up.  Well, uh, back in 19... 
[03:14:00]  I just, uh, I'm, I'm just a fan of the storytelling comics, you know, where it's a, it's a...  Yeah, the anecdotal stuff to me was always the best.  Like, all those old Warner Brothers records of Bill Cosby, like Revenge and all those,  I, I got from my stepbrother.  He gave them to me when I was like six or seven.  And I thought Bill Cosby just made kids records.  I thought they were just for, you know, like an afternoon special thing and like that Revenge  album.  I, you know, I, I think I had a freaking seizure when I first heard that. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  It was like the funniest thing I'd ever heard in my life.  Cosby, Cosby is a great comedian.  Like, I, I'm not a fan of his, but I do respect him as a comic and I acknowledge how great  he is.  My only problem with Cosby is when you take, like you mentioned, Lenny or Pryor or, or  Carlin, these guys express opinions and kind of speak through their work.  And I, it kind of bugs me that Cosby doesn't do that.  You know, he did clean humor that could be on Carson or could be in, you know, at a bar  mitzvah, but he had great mic technique, the way he would overload the diaphragm to make  the voices go low.  And, um, then, then you hear what, what Lenny Bruce is doing at the same, you know, like 
[03:15:00]  when he was, you know, towards the end of his life.  And it's just, you know, take the paint right off your car.  You know, the, the truth, this guy's dropping, like all the, you know, the, the, the recordings  Zappa made at Berkeley is just insane.  All the Phil Spector stuff.  Um, I just got that box set that Wilner put together.  I haven't had a chance to hear it yet.  My problem with Cosby is like, I, I, again, it's like, but now he comes out and says all  this stuff like about the black community, which is fine, but it's like, now he comes 
[03:15:30]  out and he goes, well, I just want to say this.  It's like, well, that's your job as a comedian for the last 35 years.  You should have been saying it on stage as a comic.  What, you know, why would you do one type of an act, which is supposed to be truthful  and based on your perceptions.  And yet now this is the way you really, you know what I mean?  That's what kind of bugs me is the inconsistency.  Well, I find him a really uninteresting.  I mean, he's, he's became like, to me, just a kind of a, a grouch to where I think his  positions are just like kind of curmudgeonly and, and, you know, not moving and, and other  comics around them were taking chances. 
[03:16:00]  You know, when he was doing all that early stuff, like, you know, to Russell, my brother  whom I slept with and all that stuff, uh, to me, it's really safe comedy.  Then you see Carlin just come, you know, ripping out of the, the, the box with, you  know, Class Clown, AM, FM, Occupation Fool.  We're like, whoa, you know, that was heavy stuff.  I had those records on, like, in third and fourth grade and I memorized them at one point.  Do you like, like, I'm a big Carlin fan.  Like, I actually, a lot of people disagree with me on this one.  I happen to love progressively what he's done more and more. 
[03:16:30]  He's kind of lost his mind in the last 10 years, but I love that.  I can dig it.  Do you like him better in the 70s or now?  The one tour he did, uh, that you, you're all infected, the one right after his wife  died, he was in a lot of pain and that material is just, you know, he was just like eviscerating  the audience.  It was kind of hard to get through because you can tell the guy is dealing with his wife  while he's on stage.  But, um, I really liked the fact that he's so furious.  I met him a while ago. 
[03:17:00]  He was really cool to me and it meant a lot just because, you know, I just, I remember him  from laughing.  Henry, we don't get excited too many times in this show, but we had George Carlin on  the air.  We were out of our minds that day.  It was a classic.  You know, I asked him that story.  I said, is it true that you were arrested with Lenny Bruce, uh, that night, you know,  when they were just hassling Lenny and just busting everyone at his shows for whatever  they could to make going to see Lenny Bruce kind of not the thing to do.  And he said, yeah.  And I said, is that how you met? 
[03:17:30]  And he said, no, that Lenny hung out with all the young comics and he would let you do  your routines in front of them and he would give you tips.  So he said, Bruce was really generous with his time with all the young guys, but he said  he was indeed cuffed with Lenny.  But like in that book, ladies and gentlemen, Lenny Bruce, they talk about it.  And I met him at MTV a few years ago and I said, you know, I have to know.  And he said, yeah, that happened.  Wow.  How many people know that?  That's not a myth.  You know, I mean, what a, what a night of your life, you know, to be cuffed with Lenny 
[03:18:00]  Bruce.  Forget it.  Henry, um, Andrew Dice Clay, genius.  I liked, you know, I'd never heard him before.  And then Rick Rubin, you know, who put out all those records, said, you've never heard  Clay?  I went, no.  And he, he gave me all his records like in one chunk.  Yeah.  And I kind of just powered through all of them in a weekend.  And what's the, the day the laughter died?  Is that the, that's my favorite one.  Yeah.  That's Rick Rubin, I think produced.  Why does everyone talk about this CD?  Norton has been trying to get me to listen to this for a long time.  I think that album is amazing. 
[03:18:30]  It's his best one.  Why is it amazing in your opinion?  Because he's so brutal and you hear him go in and out of character.  He actually, you know, apparently he's a really nice guy and he's, it's an act.  And so every once in a while he'll say something so crass you can hear his voice change  as he laughs at Andrew Dice Clay.  Yeah.  What's the background on that album again?  It was at Dangerfields here in New York.  He shot, what happened was he was, I think he was like the biggest comic on the planet  at that point.  He wanted to just walk into a place unannounced.  He walked into Dangerfields right around Christmas time and did like three or four hours, two 
[03:19:00]  nights in a row, completely unannounced and horrified the audience.  And no prepared material.  And no one was there either, right?  And 30 people.  And people were leaving.  Oh yeah.  And like, you know, some lady goes to the ladies room.  He starts talking about her.  She comes back.  Everyone's, oh man.  And you hear people like, this is horrible.  Like, yeah.  And he just tells them where to go.  The guy stands up.  You stink.  That's my favorite moment on the thing.  This guy goes, you stink.  You're as funny as a bottle of milk.  And him and his wife walk out.  My favorite comedy moment ever.  I got it. 
[03:19:30]  It's rough stuff, but I don't know.  It's kind of the job of comedy in a way.  I mean, that's my favorite record of all of them.  But I think I've never really seen the guy perform.  I saw one HBO special like a couple of years ago when he was talking about his kids and  he wouldn't like the cigarette when he was on stage because he doesn't smoke anymore.  And it seemed a little restrained, but I don't know.  I thought the records were fun.  We'll put it this way.  Anyone who gets offended by it, you're not really getting what the guy's putting out. 
[03:20:00]  I don't think it's he's trying to offend you.  He's, you know, after I heard the record, I'm like, people are like up in arms about  this.  Come on.  Yeah.  One question.  Did you work?  I'm a big Aussie freak, man.  Did you write stuff with Aussie or collaborate with Aussie?  No.  Just did some shows with him.  I've interviewed him a bunch of times.  I, I don't know, hung out with him a lot.  And he's an incredibly wonderful guy. 
[03:20:30]  He's like completely honest.  He's a good man.  I've known him, I don't know, 10 or 11 years or so.  And he's just a cool dude who, you know, he loves to, he loves to perform.  That's why he doesn't retire.  Because he just, he goes home and he just wants to go back out and play again.  Yeah.  All right.  Let me go to Eric in Kansas and then we'll wrap this up.  Eric, go ahead.  Hey, Henry.  Yes, sir.  I wanted to thank you for your, for all the great music that you've put out and the great  advice that you gave on, on one of your CDs where you said, hold on to your depression 
[03:21:00]  because it keeps you grounded and it keeps you, you're more clear headed when you're depressed.  I just wanted to say that you're just totally awesome.  Well, thanks.  Yeah, it's a.  What do you mean hold on to your depression?  Well, basically I wouldn't, I would hope that you don't walk around depressed all the time,  of course, but so many, you know, unless it's a chronic condition like we have to medicate  or jump off a bridge, there's a lot of things to be explored in, in depression where you 
[03:21:30]  get driven to such a point where there's no fake in it and there's a lot of reality to  be checked where most people pull back.  Like, it's a door you can walk in.  If it leads to self-destruction, of course, that's no good.  But I would, days I wake up depressed, I don't recoil.  I just kind of go, okay, let's see how this feels.  And I kind of walk through it for a while.  Actually learn a lot about myself and things like that.  It's like when you're, if you're working out and you got like two more reps in you, but 
[03:22:00]  you do five, it's those last three where you learn, you know, that's the workout.  So I'm not saying go out and get depressed, but there's things to be learned when you're  that messed up.  And you should understand it a little bit too.  I would rather deal with it than go get drunk.  Right, right.  You know, that's what I'm saying.  I'm not, you know, if someone's so depressed they're going to die, maybe they need to see  a doctor.  But.  No, man, when I get depressed or down, I just kind of ride it out, you know, and I understand 
[03:22:30]  it.  And also, you know, there's good, there's a lot of humor in there as well.  Yeah, hell yeah.  I mean, there's, you know, and all your great comics are, you know, a lot of them are basket  cases, you know, because it's those vicissitudes that make, that's where you get the funny  stuff from, from the extreme edges, I think.  Yeah.  All right.  My, my girlfriend bought me a down jacket because, because she said it fit my personality.  That's Jay London.  Yeah, right.  He's on the other side of the spectrum from what you do and, and people enjoy him. 
[03:23:00]  He's on the other side of the spectrum, too, though, and there's a place for him in this  world as well, and.  There is.  All right.  Very good, Jay.  Thank you.  Henry.  Yes, sir.  It's always a pleasure.  So, shock and awe, the DVD is going to be released February 15th?  Something like that, yeah.  And also, you do the, Henry's Film Corner, right?  Yeah, it's a show I have on the Independent Film Channel.  Do you just show your favorite films or something, or?  Well, we talk about, I bring in, you know, cool guests.  We're going to, this month on the show is Daryl Hannah. 
[03:23:30]  And I find her interesting just because she made the leap from big screen to independent  screen, and she's actually doing really cool, really edgy stuff, like with people like John  Sales.  And she also knows how to take a punch.  Yeah.  I mean, I guess she still has some glove marks from where Jackson Brown was just warming up  in the bullpen.  Oh, my God.  Do you think, like, I like Daryl Hannah, but do you think going from big screen to independent  is a leap or it's more like a tumble?  It's not like an upward mobility thing.  Well, you know, I asked her, I said, you know, you were such the face, like in the 
[03:24:00]  80s, the splash and all this stuff.  And she said, yeah, it was like really nice.  There was like big paydays.  But she said, you didn't get any acting done.  And I said, okay.  And she said, now I get to act.  And I think it's a somewhat luxurious position to already have a few million in the bank to  be able to go make relatively way less money in the independent world.  But that being said, you know, she's rocking the Tarantino thing, this Silver City, the 
[03:24:30]  John Sales film she was just in.  John Sales is, you know, actors break their legs trying to get in his movies.  He's a really, you know, high fiber, high calorie guy.  And she's great in Silver City.  She's like really edgy and completely nails it.  And so I just think it's interesting that she's prospering in the independent world and  she's happier because she's getting to act.  And so she struck me as a really cool person. 
[03:25:00]  I didn't know what to expect.  And she was really cool, good interview.  But that's kind of where the show is at.  We interview people.  We talk about kind of edgy and independent films, documentaries, and we leave the big  Jennifer Lopez films for like the big stations to talk about.  I don't know.  That Jersey girl, though, with Jennifer Lopez and Affleck, I think that was a really good  one, though.  I didn't know what was going to happen at the end.  Henry, we're going to let you go.  Okay.  We would love to maybe get you on the phone after the Siberia trip, man, because I'm sure  you'll have a story or two to tell. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah.  I sat in the restaurant car with a man I couldn't understand and I saw a lot of snow at the end.  I don't know.  Yeah, all right.  I'm a very able masturbator and I'm going to work on refining my technique on this trans-Siberian  journey.  Nice.  Good luck to you, my friend.  Thank you.  It's Henry Rollins, everyone.  Thanks, Henry.  See you guys.  Bye.  There he goes.  It's Henry Rollins.  You can tell from the instant feedback, a lot of people are very, very protective of  our little Jimmy.  Oh, that's why.  They lashed out and did not come back with any liking. 
[03:26:00]  I knew Jimmy could hold his own, though, when she went into the whole Richard Pryor thing.  That was awesome.  Well, I didn't.  Was all that the real dates and everything?  Of course it was.  Oh, my God.  Like Rain Man.  That was Rain Man-esque.  You're right.  And again, my only issue there was not, again, about Pryor or whatever, but just when I mentioned  stand-up, it was just kind of a, and again, he explained himself, it was just kind of  a weird attitude I took, like, you know, I'm going to do dog jokes, almost like that's  what stand-ups do.  Right, right.  Well, wait a minute, man.  Come on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, you don't have to be a bad stand-up.  Oh, it is. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  But, I mean, whatever.  It led to a good conversation there about comedy.  I didn't know that at all.  Someone wrote an instant feedback that said, Henry Rollins was playing Pryor records while  you were banging Sheely.  I was a comedian.  Jay?  Jay London?  Yeah.  Anything?  I've just had a great time here.  I'm more of in a catatonic state, but I think that's just where I should be right now.  I don't think Henry appreciated your brand of humor.  The guy was detecting a little, you know, he said, you open up with jokes like the one 
[03:27:00]  that you told, and you'll be eating tuna casserole at your mother's house.  Well, it wasn't a tuna, it was a casserole.  A casserole?  It wasn't even a tuna casserole, which is a lot better than a casserole.  Maybe where Henry's from, casserole's a very fancy dish, and maybe that's a compliment.  Shepherds cry.  Yes.  Well, I think Jay London is hilarious.  He's hilarious.  And I will be at Caroline's this weekend when he performs.  Why don't we take a break and we'll wrap up this mess.  And then I...  Oh, you got me.  Bye.  Let's listen in on a show prep meeting in the Opie and Anthony Laboratory.  Oh, my God. 
[03:27:30]  Oh, my God, baby.  Hey, guys, anyone want a bagel?  No!  No!  Stop ruining the show, Eric.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Feel the love.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  All right.  We didn't even get into the State of the Union thing, Anthony. 
[03:28:00]  No, I wanted to...  We've got a couple minutes here.  I wanted to comment.  I watched it.  You know, the smug George Bush got up there.  He's really a pro these days, though, man.  He can stand up there.  He can deliver his speech without flubbing lines.  He's a very professional speaker these days.  It's amazing.  He got up there.  He did a lot of the winking.  The little...  Yeah, he looks at his buddies in the crowd and, like, gives that smirk and a little, like,  yeah.  Like, when they're applauding, he'll look over and give it, like, a... 
[03:28:30]  Yeah, how you doing?  Wink, nod, and just comes off really, like, cocky and...  Swarmy?  Smarmy.  Yeah.  Smarmy or swarmy?  Swarmy.  Smarmy.  Hey, swarmy!  I didn't say swarmy.  You've got to fluence these dice!  Unless you're a dumb Bob Kelly who always says, shmarmy.  That's shmarmy, idiot!  It's like, shmarmy's not a word, dummy.  Smarmy.  Did they applaud him?  I didn't notice about any applause last night during the State of the Union.  Did they actually clap a little bit?  Oh, my God.  The applause breaks.  Jimmy's...  I think he's being sarcastic. 
[03:29:00]  I was like watching Danza give a speech.  I was so irritated.  Hey, huh?  And then we're going to work on Social Security, okay?  All right.  Hey, everybody.  All right, huh?  Oh, that jerk-off.  That crowd will applaud at anything.  Hey, huh?  Hey, remember me on taxi?  Wasn't that good?  Yeah.  All right.  Social Security, everybody.  Thoughts and prayers.  Thoughts and prayers.  Thoughts and prayers.  That's pretty good.  It was Bush getting up there and kind of, you know, he's on a high.  He's kind of riding it out.  Everyone in Iraq didn't die on Election Day, so it looked at like a positive thing that happened. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah.  He got up there.  He talked about that.  I think some of the Republicans in there that were for the whole Iraq situation had ink on their fingers.  Did you notice this?  Yes.  A lot of them were giving the peace sign with blue ink on their index finger like it's a solidarity with the Iraqi people.  Is that...  I see.  I misinterpreted.  Oh.  I thought they were all given hummers and given, of course, the old inch-in finger.  The old tickle up the poop chute and came out... 
[03:30:00]  Why would it come out blue, Jimmy?  The old crack tickler.  Because it was Papa Smurf that they were fingering.  You know what?  They're really brave with their blue finger and giving the peace sign.  Perhaps if there was some nut running around that room last night that would randomly pick up people and chop their heads off for having the blue thing,  then it would be true solidarity.  There would be a little danger in having your finger being blue like they were in Iraq.  Did you get a little choked up?  I just saw it today.  I didn't see it last night when the two ladies were hugging. 
[03:30:30]  Oh, yes.  That was kind of nice.  Yes, yes, yes.  That was kind of emotional.  The little Iraqi people that had voted.  Hugging.  Also, hugging the parents of a dead Marine, which was a little...  Yeah, Bush looked like he was ready to cry.  He did...  He did...  He did...  He did that stuff.  Yes.  It's like stage looking.  He cried a little?  I didn't cry.  No, I mean...  The president cried.  Yeah, the president got a little emotional, but the big thing was on Social Security.  Well, you want to listen to the opening statement?  Sure.  But I want to play like Star Wars music.  Star Wars music? 
[03:31:00]  But Opie...  What Star Wars music?  This music.  Darth Vader?  Yeah.  Vice President Cheney, members of Congress, fellow citizens.  As the new Congress gathers, all of us in the elected branches of government share a great  privilege.  We've been placed in office by the votes of the people we serve.  And tonight, that is a privilege we share with newly elected leaders of Afghanistan, the 
[03:31:30]  Palestinian territories, Ukraine, and a free and sovereign Iraq.  And Tatooine.  Hell!  Hell, Lord Vader!  Oh, that's right.  The applause breaks.  That fits great.  Doesn't it fit great?  That really fits well.  All right.  Well, that was the opening statement.  Yeah.  And the State of the Union is strong.  You want to hear that clip, Anthony? 
[03:32:00]  Oh, they always say that.  But let's hear it with this music.  Not that music.  The next clip.  Not that music will be said.  Is there a difference?  Oh, look.  There's an argument going on between Derek and I.  Kick ass.  Kick ass.  Kick his ass.  Noah would have got it right.  Fight.  Fight.  Go with the other one.  He hasn't told you anything?  They're now talking into our ear.  Oh, you heard that?  It only goes into my ear?  Unless he hits another button, then it's me.  Oh.  Is he ready now?  No.  You ready now, Derek?  Thumbs up?  Okay.  So here's the State of the Union. 
[03:32:30]  It's strong.  Let's play it with this music.  Two weeks ago, I stood on the steps of this Capitol and renewed the commitment of our nation  to the guiding ideal of liberty for all.  This evening, I will set forth policies to advance that ideal at home and around the world.  Tonight, with a healthy, growing economy, with more Americans going back to work, with  our nation an active force for good in the world, the State of our Union is confident 
[03:33:00]  and strong.  Another applause, Derek.  Can I tell you, there was that one thing he said that I thought was really brilliant.  I was, like, really surprised he said it.  He said that what they have to do is work on the country for their children and their grandchildren's  futures.  And I thought, like, wow, for a president to say that, I mean, that's really going out  on a limb.  Yeah.  That was something else. 
[03:33:30]  And I like how you see the Republicans and Democrats split up into two halves.  And the Republicans, of course, will applaud everything he says.  And the Democrats, they'll sit back, especially on a lot of the policies, and not applaud.  But then when they say something like, you know, we must have a future for our children  and their children, everyone stands up.  Even Hillary Rodham.  She'll be clapping.  And all the Democrats stand up and applaud it because, you know, what are they going to  look like?  They don't care about the kids?  She's just awful.  Behind the children.  What's that?  Everyone wants to get behind the children. 
[03:34:00]  Behind the children.  Who doesn't, huh?  Get behind a young one.  Especially a young Loatian boy, maybe.  Tussle that hair.  Leave him all confused with a tear rolling down his cheek.  He can't speak English or the Detroit police.  Send him back in.  That would have been funnier if I said Michigan, where Dama was really fun.  I really am a moron.  Why did I have to mention the state?  That's too clever for the room.  And it bombed.  Good for me.  Asshole.  I should have given his zip code.  Fat tits.  I'm wondering if we should try some of his speech with the Jaws theme. 
[03:34:30]  You wanted to hear the Social Security thing?  Well, that's one of the most controversial things he's working on now is a reform of Social  Security.  Apparently, we're running out of money.  People are living a little too long these days.  The money that's going into Social Security has a statistic.  Well, the government will take care of that.  Well.  Behind closed doors.  They'll take care of that.  That seems to be the problem.  You know, years ago, they said Social Security, for every one person on Social Security, 16  people were working, paying for it. 
[03:35:00]  That seems to be something that works.  And now they're down to, I believe, three people working for it.  And it's going to get down to two and one.  And then the whole system goes broke.  Because, like, it's what amounts to a pyramid system.  There's people working at the base of the pyramid to pay for a retired person at the top of  the pyramid.  When those pyramid scams break down, it's because there's not enough people at the bottom paying  for the more people at the top.  Because people are living longer, they're working longer, Social Security is running out  of money.  So his idea is to privatize a little bit, to make you responsible, to have your own personal 
[03:35:30]  retirement account that comes out of the money that would normally just go into Social  Security.  So now you can put it in an investment account.  There's, well, the thing with, I had a thought and I forgot.  Oops.  Coming off what he just said?  No, but it was about Bush.  You hear how articulate Anthony was?  I was watching the speech last night and it was kind of, I don't know what the Democrats'  real problem is with taking some of the money that would normally go into your Social Security  tax and putting it into some very conservative investing in mutual funds. 
[03:36:00]  I'm not talking about taking your nest egg for your future and putting it in Enron.  And they're not even talking about that because there are a lot of safeguards that are going  to be put in place.  It's more like mutual funds and not any one single stock.  It's done over time.  You can't just take your entire investment and pour it into the stock market.  But it does make sense because throughout history the market's always trended up and I think  it's a better idea than just have it on the backs of the working people to pay for people 
[03:36:30]  that are retiring.  Thank you.  You should be president.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you for so much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And I believe...  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  So I would like to continue and tell, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, people.  Surprising there, huh? 
[03:37:00]  Very good.  That's funny.  I disagree, by the way, with privatizing Social Security.  You do?  Yeah, the answer is very simple.  When you get to a certain age, they euthanize you.  Now there's an idea.  Suicide should be there, though.  Why should Grandpa be soaking up all our good money?  As you're blowing out your 80th birthday cake candles, a couple of large men come in with gloves and push your face into it until your feet stop moving.  What are gloves?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Sounds that Connor and Lacey make. 
[03:37:30]  Oh, my God.  All right, Anthony.  So why don't we, you articulated that beautifully, but let's see what President Bush has to say about Social Security.  All right.  But with this music playing.  One of America's most important institutions, a symbol of the trust between generations, is also in need of wise and effective reform.  Chasing Cheney around in fast social security with the great moral success of the 20th century. 
[03:38:00]  And we must honor its great purposes in this new century.  This girl with big boobies comes up slowly behind him at the podium.  Turns around with that shocked face on and salutes.  Gary Condon's running around with a shovel chasing Chandra Levy.  Her arms are going rapidly up in the air.  He goes in one door, she comes out of it.  She's got leaves dumped to her.  Fixing Social Security permanently will require an open, candid review of the options. 
[03:38:30]  Some have suggested limiting benefits for wealthy retirees.  Former Congressman Tim Penny has raised the possibility of indexing benefits to prices rather than wages.  During the 1990s, my predecessor, President Clinton, spoke of increasing the retirement age.  Former Senator John Brose suggested discouraging early collection of Social Security benefits. 
[03:39:00]  The late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan recommended changing the way benefits are calculated.  All these ideas are on the table.  I know that when these reforms would be easy.  But we have to move ahead with courage and honesty.  Because our children's retirement security is more important than partisan politics. 
[03:39:30]  That's right.  Yeah.  Want to try one more?  How would you like to mow my lawn?  Huh?  Well, we could try one more from the speech.  You know, something that everyone is very interested in, Anthony.  It's fighting terrorism and seeking peace, obviously.  That's a concern of every American, right?  Yes.  Yes, it is.  So if you could start the music for this one.  Our nation, working with allies and friends, has also confronted the enemy abroad 
[03:40:00]  with measures that are determined, successful, and continuing.  The Al-Qaeda terror network that attacked our country still has leaders, but many of its top commanders have been removed.  There are still governments that have sponsored and harbored terrorists, but their number has declined.  There are still regimes seeking weapons of mass destruction, but no longer without attention and without consequence. 
[03:40:30]  Our country is still the target of terrorists, our country is still the target of terrorists who want to kill them.  And intimidate us all.  And we will stay on the offensive against them until the fight is won.  Oh, that was frightening.  Music makes things better.  Yeah.  Unless it's a guy talking backwards, and a fan sends it in thinking that it's going to help, and it just didn't. 
[03:41:00]  You spoiled the bit, stupid.  It would have been great that you slowed down the backwards guy talking, but you put music to it.  What an idiot.  You played a goal off the freaking track.  Jackass.  I forgot all about that, Jimmy.  Now you've got to find that thing.  Actually, you know what?  We have to play really fast before we get out of here.  Yeah.  Remember when Jimmy farted in Washington?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I got nervous.  Ruined the whole beginning of our show down there.  Unfortunately, I don't think we're going to have time to play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show today. 
[03:41:30]  Do tomorrow.  Although Rob on Long Island writes, I learned that Ramon is a little Guatemalan.  Ramon.  And Pinchy from Cleveland learned that Ant thinks Rent Boys is steamy.  I don't agree with the content, but you can't deny it's not steamy.  You sure can't.  I'm sure gay guys reading that is steaming up everything.  Not if you examine your heart and your mind and that lump in the front of your jeans.  And Mike from Boston writes, Jay Moore loves Cox.  Nice.  And we've got to play this. 
[03:42:00]  So, yeah, Norton farted when we were in Washington earlier this week.  And I don't even know who did this.  He should get credit because it's pretty good.  One of our listeners put this together.  Who said that he rang up.  The scores told him he rang up.  It was over 50 grand, something like that.  Yes.  Over.  Jesus Christ, Jimmy.  What?  Holy shit.  Somebody brought it in.  Somebody brought it in here.  Oh, my God. 
[03:42:30]  Somebody brought it in here.  The worst spell ever in my life.  Oh, my God.  It won't go late.  That is disgusting.  That is disgusting.  Disgusting.  Disgusting.  Disgusting.  It's in my nostrils.  Somebody brought it in here.  Somebody brought it in here.  Dude, that's horrific.  Oh, Jesus.  Somebody brought it in here.  Oh, my God.  Shut up.  I can't bust you.  It won't stop.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  It's awful.  I had a burger on the metro line. 
[03:43:00]  Oh, my God.  I need something I'm going to throw up.  It could be the worst one ever.  It's like rotting eggs.  Eggs.  Eggs.  Eggs.  Eggs.  Eggs.  Eggs.  Eggs.  How cool is that?  I like the fact they put my one line explanation in.  Yeah.  I was on the train and I'm anxious.  You're on a burger and he was anxious, a little nervous.  Well, we don't have time to play Alphabet Remix, Guy.  Oh, this idiot.  Do we have time?  How much time we got?  Throw it in there real quick. 
[03:43:30]  See if we got time.  Three minutes?  Okay.  Three minutes.  You've got to actually turn the music down, though.  Yeah, turn the music off for a second.  Remember when the guy, what was his name?  Phelps Guy from the 60s Channel.  He did the alphabet backwards really fast.  It took like two seconds.  Yeah.  Well, a guy took that and what?  He reversed it and slowed it down to see if he was actually doing the alphabet.  Sounds like a great idea and it would have been cool if we could have listened to  that to see if he actually said the alphabet backwards really quickly.  But this guy put music behind it and you can't hear shit.  All right, listen to this. 
[03:44:00]  Z-Wife, Z-Wife, Z-Wife, Z-Wife, Z-Wife.  Some of you have been a T-S-R-C-P-L-N-O-T-J-F-E-C-V-A.  You have been a T-S-R-C-V-A.  More drums, asshole.  Yeah, Mr. Masters, zilch, you fucked up the bit. 
[03:44:30]  Yeah, we're all annoyed by this guy.  He really messed up the whole bit.  What an idiot.  If you're going to put something together that is going to help us maybe try to figure out what the guy was saying,  why would you put mixed music behind it?  You dumbass.  Send it without the music.  Oh, Jay London, by the way, plug at Caroline's tonight through Saturday or Sunday?  Basically through Sunday.  Yeah, I'm going to go see Jay London for tickets to Caroline's.  It's 212-757-4100. 
[03:45:00]  I want to thank Jay London for stopping by today.  I had a great time.  I'm just totally immersed in the whole action.  If you want to come by tomorrow, you're more than welcome, okay?  I learned a lot today.  Jessica, where are you going to be next?  I have a shower every day.  Program complete. </pre>
