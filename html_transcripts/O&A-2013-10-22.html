<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a post-mortem of the previous day's disastrous interview with Jenna Jameson.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with in-studio guests James Norton and Sam Roberts, recounted Jameson's emotional and seemingly intoxicated state, her tearfulness, and her ongoing custody battle with Tito Ortiz.  They dissected online reactions to the interview, highlighting the prevalence of hateful comments and comparing it to traditional bullying. The hosts discussed their own discomfort during the interview, navigating between professionalism and concern for Jameson's well-being. Opie shared a personal anecdote about a childhood bully named Boomer.

The conversation shifted to a broader discussion of bullying, both online and offline, with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton sharing personal experiences. Norton detailed a recent sleep study and his Ambien consumption.  The hosts also discussed the controversial actions of Jets fan Kurt Paschke, including his assault on a woman and his past manslaughter conviction.  A phone call with comedian Colin Quinn ensued, focusing on a planned, and highly doubted, cross-country road trip with Bobo.  Upcoming guests John Lithgow and D.L. Hughley were briefly mentioned.  The segment was liberally laced with profanity, crude humor, and sexually suggestive comments.

The show continued with a graphic discussion about an unusually large vas deferens, vasectomies, and seminal fluid.  The impending arrival of rapper Rick Ross was announced, leading to speculation and humorous, racially charged conversations about how to interact with him, referencing his "Boss" persona, his past feud with 50 Cent, and rumors about a glued-on beard.  This transitioned into a discussion of black barbershops and fights, referencing WorldstarHipHop. A GTA V anecdote about crashing a plane was also shared.

D.L. Hughley then joined the show. The discussion covered cologne, body odor, childhood memories (including the reuse of old underwear), cleaning products, and D.L. Hughley’s own stories, including a misunderstanding with a stroke victim and an insensitive comment about a colleague's mother.  Further anecdotes included a story about a pregnant woman, a landscaper nicknamed "Buck Rodriguez," California laws regarding leaf blowers and smoking, a neighbor's DUI arrest, and a meeting with Tony Danza.  Jimmy's weight loss journey and experiences with personal trainers were discussed, alongside a conversation about Joe Rogan's fitness posts and the comedic challenges faced by attractive comedians, referencing Richard Pryor's career and struggles. D.L. Hughley's new game show and anecdotes about the comedy scene, particularly Def Jam Comedy, and late-night television hosts concluded this segment.

The show continued with a discussion about the evolution of television comedy, comparing the racial humor of "All in the Family" to contemporary shows like Tyler Perry's work, and the perceived hypocrisy in racial depictions.  An in-studio interview with John Lithgow followed, promoting his children's book, "Never Play Music Right Next to the Zoo," and discussing his acting career, his villainous roles, Shakespeare, painting,  "Nightmare at 20,000 Feet," and *Third Rock from the Sun*.  The hosts playfully mispronounced his name repeatedly.

The after-show, hosted by Sam Roberts, featured listener calls discussing the Lithgow interview and Anthony Cumia's performance in Opie's absence. One caller recounted absurdities in live television news, while another contrasted the Lithgow interview with the previous day’s pedophile jokes.  A humorous exchange with DJ Hookit and the potential presence of Rick Ross concluded the after-show.

The main show returned with more discussion of the Jenna Jameson interview, describing her distress and the hosts' own pre-interview masturbation.  Justin Long was a guest, and his appearance was compared to Jameson's, with expectations of a less enthusiastic audience response unless he behaved similarly.  The conversation included tangents about Justin Long's experience watching *Jeepers Creepers*, the use of "no homo," one of the hosts’ son's "Trap Lord" clothing, and DJ Hookah's story about a sexual encounter. The show ended with sexually suggestive remarks and social media promotion.  Finally, a brief station identification announced the end of the Opie and Anthony Show and the upcoming Ron and Fez show, with the repeated phrase "Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!"


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony channel.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What?  Why didn't we listen to us?  It's the Opie and Anthony show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up. 
[00:00:30]  And Anthony...  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R-opening, it sounds like a little...  What?  He's the dang over here, don't listen to the dang over here.  Stop!  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Sounds like a choo-choo train. 
[00:01:00]  The ONA Express is rolling into your town.  Any town USA.  Hi, everybody.  How is everybody this morning?  It's a rhetorical question.  You don't have to answer as you're driving.  If you're driving, text me.  Oh, that's dangerous.  Oh, that's very dangerous.  Very dangerous indeed. 
[00:01:30]  Hi, everybody.  Opie and Anthony program.  We have, of course, the incomparable James Norton to my right.  And today, Sam Roberts.  Yeah.  To my left.  For those of you keeping tabs at home.  Drawing diagrams.  They have little baseball scorecards.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, oh, Sam's to the left today.  Oh.  Yeah. 
[00:02:00]  Sam's usually in front of Anthony, but oh.  And they have those shitty little symbols that they put like a circle in the slash.  I don't know what that means.  I never know.  I always thought those guys at the baseball game with the fucking book and their writing  in their book when something happens is the dumbest fucking thing to do.  But I think Travis used to do that, right?  Did you?  Never.  You never did that?  No.  My dad.  But a lot of people still do that.  I assumed it was a dicky thing, so you probably would have done it.  Fuck. 
[00:02:30]  What the fuck?  For your dumb Baltimore team.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A lot of people still do that.  Really?  Yeah.  Why?  Especially like the...  I don't know.  Isn't there an app you could do?  And just sit there with an iPad and go, oh, he got a K.  This was a very old school sport.  There's a big, giant scoreboard.  It's right in front of you.  It's right in front of you.  From wherever you're sitting, there's one right in front of you.  And why would you collect those stats as a fan?  I could understand if you're announcing the game. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, announcers do it so that they can quickly go back and say, oh, yeah, you know.  And they have something to talk about.  Sometimes they just want to talk about it.  Like, oh, imagine.  Some guy's just like, you know, sitting there.  Imagine sitting next to that fucking guy that's writing it down.  And it'd be like, oh, you know, this is only the third time this has happened in the past five years.  Those are the same guys that like listen to the game on the radio while they're at the game.  Oh.  Right.  With the one earphone in.  Well, there's that whole sect of like super sports fan that has to talk like a sports radio dude all the time. 
[00:03:30]  They're not sports casters.  No.  But they sit there as fans and just annoy anyone that's at the game with them.  You can't have a conversation with them.  Like, they just start yelling.  Oh, that's annoying.  You know, I got to tell you something about this team.  You got to keep in mind when they're out there on the field and you're going, shut up.  I'm right next to you.  Why are you talking at me?  A, B, see you later.  That one's out of here.  Right.  Great.  Hi.  Well, anyway, that's what's happening here today.  Hope he's out. 
[00:04:00]  It was a weird medical thing.  He had to take care of it.  What happened?  He can't stop leaking pre-seminal fluid.  Oh, Jesus.  It's a really weird thing.  Wow.  It's when you're, it's when you're, it's the vein in the scrotum.  Right.  That's supposed to block the semen and the seminal fluid.  His is like, like a reflux flap and his doesn't work properly.  So he's always leaking pre-cum.  Like, so clear stuff is just constantly.  Non-stop.  It's like a bubbling geyser of clear stuff and he just couldn't have it. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, he's got to get that fucking take care of it.  His legs look shellacked.  Shellacked.  There's got to be an issue with dehydration.  Oh, wow.  Right.  Yeah, it is.  Well, he's always drinking coffee and water.  Yeah.  But he was embarrassed to say it.  Coffee, a diuretic?  So it's not.  It's probably not the best thing to drink if you're leaking seminal fluid.  You're right, but he didn't know.  He just kept drinking it and he didn't understand.  That's different than the Seminoles, right?  Yes, much different.  Oh, okay.  That was a good improv answer by me.  I just answered literally.  Yeah, spelled differently, technically. 
[00:05:00]  Technically, if you'll look at the words.  Yeah, you're making a joke and I'm giving you, no, technically one's a tribe.  Well, I've got to say, the talk of Twitter was you two gentlemen yesterday on the after  show interviewing the lovely Jenna Jameson.  Oh, people heard it?  I think so.  I think some people heard that.  I know I did on my drive home.  Very hard to drive while staring at the radio making the butthead face. 
[00:05:30]  A little difficult, but I managed.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  The butthead face.  Just, ugh.  What the hell did she say?  Whoa, she sounds cool.  Yeah, we all listened.  I guess whoever wasn't listening or wasn't here, not many people were here, they could  have watched the video that is up there.  It looks good, the video.  I guess Sam Roberts has it. 
[00:06:00]  Not Sam, is that who you are?  Yes, that's who I am.  Not Sam on the YouTube.  Yeah.  You're the best.  It's also up on Facebook.  You're ready to smash me.  It's also up on Facebook.  Yeah.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah, you just search Janet Jameson, Jim Morton.  Right, right.  Sam Roberts, you'll find us.  There's only one video with all three of us in there, and it's not the kind that we  would prefer.  We were working on it, though.  I heard.  I heard.  As a listener, I was a basic listener on the way home, just like all you out there. 
[00:06:30]  Uh-huh.  And I got to listen to this interview.  Now, I knew there was a tad bit of an issue right when I heard, oh, she's asleep in the  green room.  Right.  Before she was even brought in, I audibly, alone in my vehicle, said, uh-oh.  I literally, out loud, said, uh-oh.  Two minutes.  Because she was here early, and so we figured we'd start the show right away. 
[00:07:00]  Sure.  And get her right in.  And then it was like, where is she?  Right.  And somebody said, well, she's scheduled for 10-15.  And it's like, it was, and I looked at my clock, and I said, it is 10-15.  Where's Jenna?  Again, alone in my vehicle.  Right.  I'm chatting with the radio.  And then I heard, she's asleep in the green room.  Again, let me reiterate what I said. 
[00:07:30]  Uh-oh.  And she was then whisked in, and the conversation started.  Oh, boy, did I know something was amiss.  Yeah, it seemed that she'd, um, you know, she's just woken up.  Sometimes when you just wake up, you're a bit groggy.  Yeah.  Groggy, yawny.  You can't get your thoughts together.  Still had some of that morning drowsiness.  Sure, sure.  That's what I, you know, assumed when I heard it.  Uh, wow. 
[00:08:00]  I, I, I was, uh, and illegally so.  I was driving and texting.  I had to text my good pals Jim Norton and Sam Roberts.  Oh, you did text me.  I didn't see it.  Because I was horrified at what I was hearing on, on the radio.  I didn't, uh, even see your text until after.  There was, yeah.  It was, she was, believe me, nothing special.  I believe my text was something way out there that nobody would ask.  Is she on drugs?  Right.  Is that one.  And, uh, Sam's text, I believe, was, holy shit, what a disaster. 
[00:08:30]  I think that was the one I sent to Sam Roberts.  Um, wow.  Uh, what happened?  What was your, your guy's take on the whole thing?  Well, I had watched an interview with her the night before.  Like, the most recent one I could find, and it was from several months ago.  And she was, like, crying on Entertainment Tonight, and I was like...  Wow.  I was like, this chick, that chick shouldn't be doing interviews.  She needs my dad to call her pissy eyes and fuckin' faggot. 
[00:09:00]  And then I saw on her Twitter, as I was researching, I saw on her Twitter, like two days before, she'd just gone on this whole Twitter rampage about Tito Ortiz and custody of her kids, and she was posting screen grabs from her phone of text messages that weren't returned of her begging to FaceTime with her kids.  Nothing worse than the online, uh, argument with a loved one.  But it was one-sided.  You'd never want that to happen.  Yeah, yeah.  There was no back and forth.  Well, he's probably thinking, like, oh my god, my ex-wife is the biggest porn star ever, so people listen to her. 
[00:09:30]  It's not like she's just some fuckin' chick.  Yeah.  Everyone knows who she is.  Right.  And she's, you know, going after you on Twitter, it's like all this private shit coming out.  That's awful.  That's terrible.  And so, but when she walked in, I go, this is ten times worse than the interview that I watched last night saying she shouldn't be doing interviews.  And I saw on Fox News, they had, uh, she was doing one of the morning shows, and I saw a video clip somebody posted of them kind of walking her out of the studio. 
[00:10:00]  She's in her heels, and she was a little shaky on her feet.  So, uh, that was before she even came here.  Yeah.  Oh, was that before us?  Yeah, Good Day.  She did Good Day New York, and that video's gone everywhere, uh, as of yesterday afternoon.  Because apparently she was supposed to do two long segments with them.  Oh.  And they canceled it.  That's why she was here early.  Oh.  Because they pulled her segments after.  Well, that was good.  For a nap.  Three minutes of TV.  She was here early for a nap. 
[00:10:30]  Even though that's a different show than ours, I'm like, why, to me, that was really interesting to listen to, like, it's, because she'd been talking about it publicly.  Yeah.  Jimmy, it's Good Day New York.  Not Depressing Crying Day New York.  Right.  What's wrong with you?  But that's where she's at.  Like, it is what it is.  Like, she's promoting something, but everyone knows.  It's like she's a really well-known person.  Sure.  And this is what she's, she's, and it's not like you're going to her house with a camera and fucking, you know, sandbagging her or whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  She's coming out for an interview.  Jenna Jameson whacked out live TV segment cut short over bizarre behavior on TMZ. 
[00:11:00]  And the craziest thing about this, the Good Day New York thing, it's on TMZ, it's on all these places.  Yeah.  She's 10 times better on Good Day New York than she was here.  Oh, yeah, than she was here.  And the video's available on YouTube.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, so she comes in, she sits down.  And as a listener, I'm hearing these long gaps of silence and sniffling and tears almost immediately. 
[00:11:30]  She got upset very quickly.  Yeah, and it was like letting it sit there and just be, it was, I didn't want to interfere with it.  Like, honestly, it was, that's what was happening.  Right.  And why there's no need to cover it up and there's no need to rush through it.  And there's no need to, well, let it happen.  It is what it is.  Again, that was where she was at in the interview.  I kind of liked on the video, when you're listening, you didn't catch this.  On the video, you can see Jimmy's reaction to the whole thing. 
[00:12:00]  And it reminded me, remember when Carson used to tell a self-deprecating joke and kind of look around like,  that's what Jimmy looked like.  He's just, side to side, looking like, okay.  Okay, I could tell you were a tad uncomfortable with the situation.  Honestly, not as much as you think.  Really?  No, because again, I've seen that.  Yeah, yeah.  It was, I felt bad for her.  I felt really sad for her.  Like, I felt very sad watching that.  Like, yeah. 
[00:12:30]  And when you watch people on Twitter get so like, you know, oh, fucking, you deserve to lose your kids, you porn whore.  Like, it was, in that moment, you're just watching somebody who's having a fucking, for whatever reason, her own making, whatever you want to say.  But it was just really sad to watch.  That's interesting, too, because I know you know her in some capacity.  You worked with her at APN.  Yeah.  And you've met her a couple of times.  So I knew you weren't going to go after her.  And it would be silly to just go after some girl that's like, you know, crying and stuff. 
[00:13:00]  But I know how you feel about the me, me, me thing.  And that does seem to be kind of a little selfish.  Like, I was getting this selfishness of her.  Like, she does have kids.  Because I don't know the back story, so I could be completely off base here.  But I was catching some selfishness going like, well, you've got to get your shit together.  And there was the moment, too, where Jim said, he said, or he asked, is any of this stuff that you could be doing differently? 
[00:13:30]  Yes, yes.  And she says, no.  No.  Like, I don't need to change a thing.  And everybody at that point in their car alone probably said, oh, boy.  Right.  Oh, boy.  She's fucked up.  Yeah, sometimes, you know, again, I can't say she was, I don't know.  I just, you've got to give the person the opportunity to say, yeah, I should be doing this or that.  Right.  But I just felt sad for her.  It was like, it's hard to watch someone that, because it wasn't coming from a place of, ah, it was just, she's a mother. 
[00:14:00]  And maybe she, whatever happened with Tito and the kids, I don't even know.  Right.  But when you watch somebody crying because they can't see their kids, even if it's their own making, it's still hard to watch.  Now, what is the story with her and this guy?  It's not Tito that she's in this battle with, right?  It is, yeah.  It is, with the kids?  Yes, Tito Ortiz has those kids.  All right, look, I didn't even know that.  I thought it was some other dude.  No, it's Tito.  No, it's Tito.  Holy fuck.  Although Ron and Fez started, and Ron Bennington came on and said he and Jenna are working at their differences. 
[00:14:30]  He's got the kids in their safe.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Yeah, no, that whole thing.  Tito Ortiz has the kids and is in the house and won't let her in.  Are they kids with him?  Yes.  Fuck.  Were you there?  I'm sorry.  I thought it was some other guy.  No, no.  We saw them together when we were in Comic-Con.  No, no, no.  At the UFC expo.  At the UFC event, and Tito is being inducted into the Hall of Fame.  Hall of Shame?  That's right. 
[00:15:00]  Well, the UFC Hall of Fame.  And she and Jenna was with him, and I've seen them together a few times at UFC events.  Oh, see, I didn't know it was...  Yeah, it was Tito Ortiz.  I thought it was some guy before Tito or something.  I guess we probably could have made that a little clearer, but it was weird.  I assume everybody knew it.  And it was weird to tell the story.  I was wearing a UFC shirt.  Oh, my God, you were in...  Yes, you were.  Dude, I wasn't even...  It really literally was...  I wasn't fucking...  Shut up, being a Tito shirt on.  Hey!  I wasn't doing it on purpose.  Oh, man. 
[00:15:30]  I doubt she even noticed.  Maybe not.  Well, probably not.  I was like, oh, my God.  She probably saw it, like, some blurry writing.  Something.  There were a couple moments where it's like, when she first walked in and started talking,  Jim and I kind of gave each other this look like, all right, here we go with something.  And then the second one, I think the look that people thought Jim was uncomfortable, we were  both pretty surprised that she broke down within five minutes of being here.  It was really quickly.  Yeah.  And to sit there and listen as she's trying to pitch this sexy book, as she's just weeping 
[00:16:00]  and conveying these depressing stories of losing your children, it's like, wow, I had  my dick out and I'm just jacking as I'm driving.  This was so hot.  And you got to wonder, like, who are the people around her?  Yeah.  They're like, Jenna, we got to get you out.  We got to get you doing interviews.  Because at the end of the day, she, it's not like we found out she was a damaged person 
[00:16:30]  and tried to get her in.  Oh, right.  She asked to come here or somebody asked on her behalf, can she please come in?  Okay, we'll talk to her.  Yeah, yeah.  You didn't go and dock it on her door or anything like that.  Like, who are the people that are carting her around and putting her in interviews?  I don't know.  It won't hurt sales, though.  It won't hurt sales.  No, no.  It'll do great for sales.  Live appearances.  People will go just to see her.  And even though she's depressed or she's having a hard time, people are talking about  Jenna Janis today.  It doesn't matter.  At one point, when she did start crying and Jimmy brought it back to the book, I thought 
[00:17:00]  a publicist was fucking stink-eyeing you.  No, I did that.  And I knew when I was doing that, I'm like, I wasn't like, I wasn't uncomfortable with  her crying.  It was like, I didn't know what else to do in that moment.  Like, I didn't want to be...  Barbara Walters.  Nah, but there's a weird line between, I don't want to, look, she's breaking down  and having a hard time, but I don't want to be like, ooh, good.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:17:30]  Like, hey, she should have promoted this, just, I knew she was still going to, you know.  Yeah, yeah, you were still going to get...  She had just gotten there.  We could talk about the book for a little bit before we get back here.  And it also, I also was afraid they might pull her.  Right, right.  It was a part of me thinking like...  Was a publicist here with her and stuff?  Yeah, but they were fine.  Okay.  They were in the other room.  But I was afraid that there was going to be that moment where they're like, we got to  go.  We got to go now.  And you know, if you talk about the book, that in just a matter of minutes, the despicable  Sam Roberts will bring it right back to tears. 
[00:18:00]  I didn't do anything despicable.  He was listening going, oh, you son of a bitch.  I asked questions that were legitimate and pertained to the conversation.  You needn't make an excuse.  I was going, yeah, I was cheering for Sam Roberts.  I thought Sam was fair, though.  I didn't think you were a fucking exploiter or a shame at all.  No, no, he was.  But he brought it right back to the tears at one point.  But that was also the real thing of like...  Of course.  If we had just sat there and talked about the book for the next 25 minutes, it would 
[00:18:30]  have been, what is this?  It was good to get into it for a minute, and you got to plug what they're there for, but  there really wasn't much to say.  It was fiction.  It's not like it's real life.  And you can't make your business, your private...  You can't go out of your way to make your private business public and then expect people  not to talk about it.  They got to talk about it.  It's not like we had to research and found out these secrets.  It's like I was looking at your Twitter feed.  How did she look, by the way?  Did she look weathered?  Did she look a little haggard?  Did you see my picture? 
[00:19:00]  I mean, I know she looked okay, but did she look her age?  Did she look older?  Did she look like a lot of work done?  Did she look depressed?  Like, people get that look.  Well, here.  She looked better than she has.  I've heard she looked better than she sounded from a lot of people.  And she knows how to pose for pictures.  Wow.  She fucking knows.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She looks good in that pic.  Which she's still not...  I mean, she used to be like the hottest chick ever.  Dude, I tweeted pictures of her early in her career yesterday. 
[00:19:30]  Stunning.  Yeah.  Fucking beautiful.  And, man, that porn industry will...  It's like a meat grinder.  But she did get out on top.  I mean, again, with Club Jenna.  And she came out.  Again, seeing how they treat her at AVN.  And this is in 2004.  January of 2004.  She's royalty!  Oh, my God.  And, I mean, that's...  It was in fucking full swing.  The expo.  Right.  There's thousands and thousands and thousands of people there. 
[00:20:00]  And she was the fucking queen bee, man.  Bella the ball.  Yeah.  Jenna is royalty in that world.  Yeah, yeah.  But everywhere.  It's not just all in porn.  Anywhere she goes, she's Jenna Jameson.  Yeah, yeah.  So, you know, she came from a place of being quite on top.  And it really seems like she let herself fall apart after she was well out.  Like, years after she was out of porn.  That is odd.  She did very well for herself out of porn.  Wasn't she...  She had the website, right?  Yeah, Club Jenna. 
[00:20:30]  Club Jenna.  And she was selling, like, other people's porn, other people's work, whatever the fuck  you want to call it.  She became a producer.  So, she's making a lot of money.  Now, what happened?  Did Tito get her shit?  No, no, no.  They sold Club Jenna to Playboy.  Oh.  Playboy bought Club Jenna and kept Jenna and her ex-husband on as, like,  executive.  What year did that happen?  I didn't know that.  That was...  Her other ex-husband.  Right, right.  Her ex-husband's name is Jay.  He was a performer named Justin Silver.  Right. 
[00:21:00]  And his real name is Jay, like, Dina or something.  And, uh...  You doesn't have to call him Jay.  Yeah.  Oh, you could call him Ray.  You could just call him Lucky Motherfucker.  But, uh...  He was a guy who was very...  You could tell he was a bright, savvy business guy.  He wasn't some dumb...  Dealing...  Because he was the one who kind of, you know, oversaw everything they were doing back then.  And you knew he was a guy who knew what he was doing.  Yeah, yeah.  He wasn't so dumb.  Okay.  So, he probably...  What, in the divorce or something, he wound up getting the lion's share of the goods? 
[00:21:30]  Where did she spend hers?  I don't know.  Maybe she spent her...  Oh, boy.  I've heard there are rumors that he took a lot in the divorce.  Wow.  Like, he walked away with a lot of the rights to things.  It's not like he was getting a fat cock up his ass.  That's right.  But he was in charge of her.  And he did films with her.  And, you know...  Uh-huh.  He was...  Well, after they got married, he was the only one that shot with her.  The only guy.  That's like he changed his...  He had an on-screen name and that.  Oh.  Justin Silver.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Wow.  Yeah.  So, then...  So, she's left now without really an income, aside from, you know, book or appearances that 
[00:22:00]  she does.  Right.  And without her kids, with no fucking man in her life, depressed.  And coming from a place, like we said, of being very much...  You know, royalty.  Yeah, you're on top.  You're on top.  And then it's just like, it really made me sad for her.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, yeah.  I understand all about people doing their own shit and making their own... 
[00:22:30]  Uh-huh.  I get it.  But it's still hard to watch.  Because she's always been...  She made her own bed.  Now roll over and take a big dick in the ass in it.  But it was just having had a few experiences.  Not many with her.  But she was always so nice to me.  Yeah, yeah.  I can't...  I just can't...  I know.  I could tell.  I can't vulture somebody.  That was fine.  Well, you had Sam Roberts.  I didn't even think Sam did.  I was fucking circling above.  Sam's a horrible person.  Sam Nancy Grace Roberts.  He has smart questions, though.  I thought he has really smart questions.  No, he did. 
[00:23:00]  Even though he's garbage as a person.  Oh, complete trash.  But you also, like, you look back, and I was YouTubing her yesterday.  That looks good.  And she did, like, interviews with Bill O'Reilly, and there were all these interviews with Bill O'Reilly, and she's so on the ball, and there, and present, and has shit to say, and has her shit together.  Are you saying she didn't respect the after show?  To come in sober and coherent?  I don't know if you heard the interview, but she's been sober for seven years. 
[00:23:30]  I did hear that part, and I did hear Sam comment later about where she was living, and if it was good for her career, and her sobriety.  How you said that with a straight face, I'll never know.  You're trying to get it out of her.  Of course.  Well, Jim, I noticed you two were commenting, like, when you said, is there anything that you would do differently?  Is there anything, maybe, that you could do?  And you did ask her about some type of drug or alcohol use, and she said, well, I have a couple of beers, or something like that. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, so I said, oh, you're totally sober.  Right, right, right.  She said she was sober for seven years, and I think that listening, we felt that that's kind of hard to...  Oh, yeah, yeah, because I said, is it alcohol and pills, too?  Uh-huh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think some people do think that prescription medication is sober, like, you're not out getting coke, you're not boozing it up like crazy,  but you'll pop enough Zannies or fucking, you know, Vicodins or something like that, and you're still sober, right, which I don't think that counts. 
[00:24:30]  People got really...  It was funny, like, reading Twitter after, like, you know...  People think, hey, man, you shouldn't have your kids, or I side with Tito is one thing, but listening to some of the fucking, the really nasty people...  Yes.  And it was like, why would you be so...  Like, what did she do that you're that nasty to her?  Uh-huh.  And it's like, you know you'd fucking... 
[00:25:00]  You'd kill the woman you're married to to fuck her.  Yeah.  Like, you don't genuinely feel that way.  There's, like, this really weird thing, like, what you did, you fuck you, you deserve it, you bitch.  Yeah, I don't know where that comes in with people.  I think that's them yelling at every girl that's ever turned them down.  You know what I mean?  Every girl they didn't have a shot with.  Yeah.  Like, to see something bad happen to the pretty girl.  I think you're right, yeah.  A lot of the guys that are at a rough time in high school are pretty happy about that.  Gotta be honest.  When you go to Facebook and you do see maybe a girl that you found attractive, that you wanted in high school, 
[00:25:30]  and she turns out to be a fat slob, right?  Her life is falling apart.  A little chuckle.  Where she survives a whale of fire, and the only thing that's left intact are her eyelashes.  There is something about that, where you do kind of, you do go, oh, good.  Yeah.  What a horrible thing.  What a terrible fucking species we are to even want to see that. 
[00:26:00]  But then it does, it goes a step further when you're now trying to see bad happen to female celebrities,  to any woman who's ever been attractive.  Right, right.  That's a whole other level of...  It's so easy now with Twitter and whatnot, because, you know, I guess you used to have to write a letter.  You fucking whore, I'm glad that...  You think people wrote those letters?  There are times, I bet they did like somebody had to.  There are times where you go to post something on Twitter, and halfway through writing it, you're like, 
[00:26:30]  eh, fuck this.  And we want to have...  And you hit cancel.  And for how quickly and easily you can post something, it's amazing that there is still some kind of filter.  But imagine if you had to write a letter and mail it.  There's so many steps and so much time that has to go by.  You could really assess what you're doing and kind of rip it up and say, fuck it.  But with Twitter, it's so easy to just post hate and fucking drivel or whatever very quickly. 
[00:27:00]  You're not writing it out and then reading it again in the morning before you drop it in the mailbox.  Right, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you physically have to fucking find a mailbox, put a stamp on it, find the address you've got to send it to.  Now it's just ding, ding, ding, you're a whore.  It's instantaneous.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So I was reading a lot of the tweets that were coming in, and there was a lot of fuck you, you know,  she deserves what she got, the kids are much better off without her, things like that.  And, you know, if you filter out the just hatred of a guy that didn't get laid in school, 
[00:27:30]  some of them kind of made sense, because could you imagine her in that condition with children?  It's probably not the safest environment.  Yeah, I don't know Tito that well, just from a few interactions.  Well, he's just putting them in fucking arm bars.  It's not like, you know, it's kind of funny.  A little four-year-old in an arm bar tapping daddy.  I don't know what he's like, I don't know, I really don't know.  I don't think that, because she's like, she's kind of blaming the whole thing on him. 
[00:28:00]  I think every, you know, there's always two fucking people who choose to be involved,  and they usually both contribute.  You can't know what he's doing, and you can't know exactly what the situation was,  but what you can know is, I probably wouldn't leave my children with the woman I talked to yesterday.  There you go.  And that's kind of what I took away from it, when she's talking about she hasn't seen her kids and stuff.  I don't think it's the courts, you know, being mean. 
[00:28:30]  I don't, I'm sure Tito's being vindictive, because that's what you do as an ex-husband with a wife that's like that.  Because there were certain points that I was listening, and I was having fucking flashbacks.  Like, oh, brother, I would not want to be married to that.  And then I'm like, oh, fuck, I was.  Shit.  So he probably isn't the most pleasant guy with her, just based on if she's like that. 
[00:29:00]  Why would you want to release your children to a woman that's that fucked up?  Let's be honest.  Yeah.  Yeah, she sounded a little bit out of it.  A little bit out of it, Jim.  But I'm meaning, like, I've seen more fucked up people than that.  You know, just being diplomatic.  I've seen a lot worse.  Being diplomatic.  She just sounded, again, it's hard to say, because I don't, it sounded to me like somebody who was either hungover,  or who is on something for a prescription. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  And again, pills affect you so fucking weirdly.  That was definitely prescription medication.  It sounded like it.  Yeah.  And you've seen a lot more fucked up people, but never on a book tour.  Just brought around.  Yeah, never, never in a radio studio brought in.  You would think her people would be like, all right, Jenna, we're starting our day of press.  I'll come to your room or whatever and come and get you.  And then the second the door opens, you go, yeah, we're canceling everything we have today.  You're fucked up. 
[00:30:00]  No, her people are like, well, just catch a 10-minute nap in a green room.  You should be fine.  Well, you would think after the Good Day interview.  That would be it.  Right there.  Yeah, but then they still brought her over here.  They might be book people, though.  They might not be her personal, you know what I mean?  They just want to sell books.  Just get out there.  No, I mean, she was with, like, a couple of people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Only one of them is the book person.  Yeah, but they're all in the business of Jenna Jameson.  I find them despicable.  That they wouldn't protect her a little bit more and have her, you know, not do that. 
[00:30:30]  It was kind of embarrassing.  It's fucking, you know.  It is, but I kind of like the fact that she did it.  Oh, believe me.  I loved it.  Not just for us, but I like the fact that there's something really honest.  Even if someone's falling apart, it's almost like, let people see what it is.  Like, she's having a really hard time.  I think she's in a bad place right now.  Yeah.  Let people see it.  This way you don't just fucking read about it one day and go, oh, my fucking God.  Like, let people see it and understand what it is.  But at the same time, that interview can come back and haunt her in court now. 
[00:31:00]  That's another thing.  And the Good Day thing.  Come back and haunt her in court.  A lot of people are saying that.  Like, oh, boy, that's testimony right there.  I think it'll do good because she said in the interview that she's sober.  Yeah.  If it drives you to rock bottom, like, I wanted to, and I didn't ask her because I should have,  but I feel like I'm watching a person hit bottom.  Right.  That's what it felt like when I was talking to her.  Yeah.  And that's always a good thing.  When somebody hits fucking bottom, they can start to, you hope they don't die or wind up 
[00:31:30]  in prison.  Right, right.  That's the best way up and out is through bottom.  So maybe this fucking horrible thing will help her out, I hope.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's sad all around.  I know.  It was very compelling to listen to.  I got to give you guys that.  That's for sure.  Your video is part of the Mirrors article.  No.  And they say that show hosts Jim Norton and Sam Roberts were visibly uncomfortable with  the damaged state of their guests.  But that's literally... 
[00:32:00]  The troubled blonde questions.  That's not true that we were visibly...  I didn't feel that uncomfortable.  You know what?  I didn't feel uncomfortable at all.  Maybe it looked that way, but...  Regardless of how you felt when you watch the video, the way you're peering around, especially  at that first breakdown she has.  Absolutely.  You're kind of...  And you almost give this...  You look at Sam at one point and almost smile like, holy fuck, what the...  What are we doing?  Yeah.  What are we in here?  Yeah.  Yeah.  There was definitely a feeling of...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where is this going?  Right.  What are we going to do?  What should we be doing here? 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You had an engine go out on you.  That's the look you had.  One engine went out.  If someone breaks down or cries...  It's really weird.  I want it to be legitimate.  Like, there's a really weird line where you don't want to be the vulture scumbag.  Yeah.  Like, that just when someone is down, you start kicking them and probing them.  Like, ooh, this will sound good.  Yes.  And it's really...  There's like a really weird balance with that.  Because we bash people that do that on TV.  Yeah.  When you see Barbara Walters.  When they smell blood in the water, yeah, you don't want to be that guy. 
[00:33:00]  But I also don't want to cover it either.  Like, go pretend it's not happening.  There was one part of the interview where she took a real long time to answer.  A question was asked.  And you heard her sniffling and kind of breathing funny.  You knew she was very upset.  And I don't know why, but I just pictured Jimmy, like, maybe putting his hand on her hand  and, like, comforting her as I was driving. 
[00:33:30]  He did open the water for her.  Oh, you did?  And put it next to her and put the tissues.  Well, they asked me for a tissue in my ear.  Oh.  E-Rock, which I thought was her publicist to somebody.  Which I should have, but it was just good manners.  I should have done it anyway.  Yeah, yeah.  So E-Rock said, could you give her tissues?  I should have thought of that.  There was a funny comment on the video.  Because you can see Jim gets a bottle of water and opens it and puts it in front of her.  And they were like, did you learn nothing from Mike Francesa?  There's no cap on that water.  You know, I didn't think of it.  She actually, in that moment, collected herself better than I thought she was going to. 
[00:34:00]  Because she was, it was, it was like, the question was something about what...  Well, the first question that got her was, are you okay?  Yeah.  Are you okay?  Yeah, because you were, you were obviously concerned at her state there.  So you asked if she was okay.  And then the answer was, no.  But I didn't want to get into it.  And again, how else to get into from this book, which is so different than the way she was being at that moment.  It was, it was a really weird, it was like somebody promoting fucking balloons. 
[00:34:30]  Like, you know, they're out promoting balloons, but they walk in with a bandage on their wrist.  Because that's, how do you...  That's exactly what it was.  Here's this book that's supposed to be sexy and fun and everything.  And then she's just this depressed disaster on the radio.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So it was, it was very compelling.  In that moment, better than, because it looked like she was going to really have a, that was later on.  That was something about the courts. 
[00:35:00]  You might have asked something about Tito and what did he say, whatever it was.  And she was ready to, but so that's why her pause, uh, it sounded like something really fucking bad was coming.  Yeah, yeah.  But then she kind of collected herself.  But I think that also, the way she was able to collect herself and then get sad again and then come back from it,  was that manic kind of, you're fucked up behavior.  Because that was, that was weirder than if she would have cried the whole time.  Uh, it was the way she came out of it and she's laughing and then, you know, and then fucking Sam Roberts pops back in with a goddamn question that gets her all fucking upset again. 
[00:35:30]  Towards the end of the interview, it, it was very upbeat, you know, happy affair.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I thought I was trying to sink my way into getting a date.  Into fucking her, yeah, yeah.  I wouldn't have fucked her in that condition.  I honestly wouldn't.  Do you text her?  Yeah, but not, you know.  Just to say hi.  Wait till she passes out.  Even me.  Yeah, I know.  I couldn't do that.  You're a gentleman.  Nah, just.  At heart.  I'm a pig, but there's a point where, uh, you know, someone's just too sad. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, yeah.  There's no way, there's no way Jenna Jameson sleeps with me unless she's on the end of the plank.  So, and to me, I would just feel too bad.  Well, we were talking about hitting rock bottom.  Oh, my God.  This is all a downward spiral leading to sex with Jim Norton.  Can you imagine if she woke up and looked at me and the next day went to rehab?  She actually just says, I need help.  I want to thank Jim Norton for being my absolute bottom. 
[00:36:30]  Because I woke up and I thought someone had left a glad bag of shit next to me.  And then it talked.  The guys were hammering her, man.  Like, maybe it reminded them of somebody, too.  But I'm reading this, and I'm not a white knight.  They're like, hey, guys.  But I'm like, where is this fucking dislike of this woman who you've jerked off like an animal to?  That's the new fucking world we live in with social media.  The instant ability to shit on people without any thought to it, without any thought of consequence, with anonymity. 
[00:37:00]  I mean, the ability to fuck with people now.  And that's a lot of this bullying shit that's going on.  And recently we've had, you know, people in their teens, one girl killed herself, another boy, like, tried to kill himself.  Because it's internet bullying for the most part. 
[00:37:30]  It's not even the old in-your-face, you know, punch-the-kid-in-the-stomach-in-school-bullying that goes on anymore.  It's so easy to shit on somebody.  And it's the consistency of it.  Just constant.  Constant hammering.  Like, firing you home and never...  And even so, the victim puts the ammunition out there by posting pictures and everything.  Their whole life is out there for you to shit on.  They feel good about, you know, their picture with them and their dog or something. 
[00:38:00]  And then somebody just shits on it and says, oh, is that the dog that fucks your mother and shit like that?  I mean, it's so easy to be 20,000 times more brutal than you had to be face-to-face.  I put photos of myself with my cat online.  Oh, is that the one with your long hair, you faggot?  Is that the one?  They just make fun of me.  Everyone knows you have no friends.  Exactly.  And it's also the thing of, like, okay, finally, pretty girl, I get to be better than you. 
[00:38:30]  Yes.  I gotta go tell the world and make sure that you know that now I get to be better at you.  Do you honestly think, with fucking Pizza Face, walking up in high school,  to the most beautiful girl, you would walk up to her and go, you fucking bitch, you're a piece of shit.  No!  But to be fair, there were probably a lot of guys that wore Pizza Faces that somebody like Jenna Jameson came up and was just like, oh, fuck.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah. 
[00:39:00]  You can't talk to me.  It goes both ways.  But I don't think it was ever that brutal as it is online.  Because that anonymity and that distance gives you the fake fucking balls to say the worst, most horrific shit to people.  And it's definitely having an effect on especially kids in school.  Because kids, we know, they're fucking brutal anyway.  But now to have that outlet, it's fucking horrific. 
[00:39:30]  And the weirdest thing is when you read it, and then you go to the profile, and it's like a picture of a guy with his two kids.  And you go, you're still doing this and you're raising kids?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like what if somebody was doing it to your kids?  You'd think that once you have kids, you wouldn't do things that you wouldn't want people doing to your kids.  To your kids.  I'm guilty of that when people strike first.  Like I won't just fucking shit on people.  But I've been shit on, and then I've just researched every bit of Facebook pictures and tweets and whatnot. 
[00:40:00]  I'll go back years in their tweets until I find a link of a picture with them and their kids.  And I'll be like, your fucking daughter looks like a mongoloid.  And your fucking wife is a fat pig piece of shit.  But, you know, you fired the first round.  And they want to treat you like you're a public figure so I can say whatever I want.  Well, fuck you.  You made yourself a public figure. 
[00:40:30]  Now I see what your kids look like.  You stepped into the public arena and publicly said something.  There's a difference between somebody emailing you something and then somebody publicly at mentioning you and saying something.  But again, I would never walk up to these people and say, hey, your wife's a fat lump of shit and your kids are ugly.  While he's walking with his family.  Yeah, he's walking with his family.  First of all, you get your fucking ass kicked.  Secondly, people just don't act like that in a civilized society.  It's mean.  But online, you're able to just be a fucking asshole. 
[00:41:00]  Right.  And yeah, that's the type of bullying.  Because I don't think in-school bullying is any different than it used to be.  I remember...  Probably less actually now.  You're probably right.  I don't think there's this newfound bullying that goes on in school.  Kids will fucking taunt each other.  They'll push each other.  Smack each other in the head.  Whatever.  In school.  But it's this online bullying that really takes its toll. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, I saw this yesterday.  Apparently some kid...  It's a Halsey Parkerson.  My name's Halsey Parkerson.  He was being bullied.  Yeah, with a name like that, you have to be.  And I think he's a ginger.  You poor little fuck.  Is he the one that came with a gun or no?  No, he's a kid that was being bullied.  And he put out a little thing on Facebook.  Was it his Facebook?  Oh, the video, yeah.  No, he said, hey, I need some friends.  Apparently this bully said, ah, fuck, you don't have any friends. 
[00:42:00]  It was kind of hassling the kid.  And the kid put it out on Facebook to car clubs, various car clubs.  And they showed up at the school, hundreds of people, to back this kid up and say, hey, we're behind you.  And he confronted the bully and talked to him.  And him and the bully kind of shook hands.  And the bully apologized to him.  And he said, oh, you do have friends.  And it was kind of this uplifting little thing that happened. 
[00:42:30]  It's kind of nice when they don't bring a gun to school.  But you read so many stories that go the exact opposite way, where this kid goes home and kills himself.  It's either he kills himself or he goes to the school and shoots the bully and a few other people.  It kind of, yeah, that worked out.  But that's the kind of shit that's going on.  That kid obviously would be bullied.  He kind of looks a little fruity.  Kids like that, you know, always catch the brunt of shit.  I think he's frosting his hair.  You rock. 
[00:43:00]  He's got wacky glasses.  I don't even know what, like, looks dorky in school these days.  You can't say, like, you think something that would have looked dorky is everybody's like, that's cool.  Yeah, yeah.  Skinny jeans and a fucking dildo hat.  And all the girls love this kid.  Dildo hats are in.  Fucking dildo hat.  You are the shit.  But then I'm watching him and he's kind of dorky and stuff.  And all these, like, chicks from school were coming up to him and hugging him.  And like, we're behind you.  It's like, this guy figured out the way to fucking get girls. 
[00:43:30]  They're not going to date him.  No.  You don't think?  No.  You think it's just friends?  Nobody dates the redhead who calls the car club people to come and rescue him in a video.  They can support him all he wants.  They're still going to fuck the bully.  He's the guy that they tell their boyfriends, I wish you were as nice as him, but they don't leave their boyfriends.  And the boyfriend goes, you want me to be a fucking fag?  Exactly.  And then she's like, oh, stop.  Paul sucks his dick. 
[00:44:00]  And this poor fuck is going home with nothing.  Yeah, just looking at photos of cars.  He's going to get bullied again tomorrow.  Obviously, once the car club leaves, the bully's going to come back and go, remember that apology?  Fuck your mother.  Bam, right in the face.  Oh, it's so, I don't know.  It's terrifying as parents.  I'm trying to think back.  You know how they say you remember the better shit and kind of the bad shit goes off?  I'm trying to remember some real evil shit from school and stuff. 
[00:44:30]  And I don't know.  I can't really place it.  But it's got to be worse these days.  I don't know why.  I just think it is.  Is it because you cried so much that they all just blend together?  Oh, I was just so weepy.  By high school, I had cut off all emotion.  So it wasn't real.  That's probably why you don't remember anything bad.  I think junior high was the last time I was very emotional or felt bad or cried.  It's definitely worse now.  When my father told me, next time I see you crying, you better have an arrow in your chest. 
[00:45:00]  That was a quote, mind you, from my dad.  An arrow in your chest?  Not just, you know, sprain your ankle, stub that toe, because that could bring tears.  Now, you did go to school when the cowboys and the Indians were fighting.  Is that why?  That is exactly what happened.  It was, I believe, the Comanches were running rampant around Capistrano at the time.  And it was a viable chance that an arrow would be in my chest. 
[00:45:30]  Happened to children all the time.  See, what that meant was, I never want to see you cry.  Hence the arrow in my chest.  I never forgot that quote.  I believe I was at some event.  I remember there were bleachers, something, I was there.  And I got a cramp in the back of my thigh.  And it hurt very badly.  And I straightened my leg, I went, and I started crying. 
[00:46:00]  Because you had a cramp?  It hurt really bad.  In your period?  Look, I was probably 13.  Oh, that's awful.  And my dad did tell me at that point, next time you cry, you better have an arrow in your chest.  I wonder if you're secretly gay, but you cut off all your emotions, so you have no idea.  Secretly?  Exactly.  I, uh, like one day, like you'll start allowing emotions, and then you'll be like, I love men. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  I don't, I don't know.  The next thing you know, he's bringing in fucking cum in a thermos.  Eating it like soup.  I don't even think the gayest of gay men do that, Jimmy.  But it is weird.  Cum in a thermos.  Ant's such a nice guy.  Like, people only hear the show, and they just hear this angry psychopath, and by them, I mean, we sit next to him.  But then you see Ant with this dumb cat, or like, something doesn't fit in that picture.  Yeah?  Yeah, and especially knowing what a sensitive, blubbering kid he was growing up. 
[00:47:00]  You don't just not become that person.  There is a wacky duality there, and I understand it, because I will tweet, uh, horrific things about, um, certain cultures on Twitter.  And then, we've noticed.  Bookend it with adorable Beavis pictures.  Uh, and I know that seems very psychopathic.  But you know what, that's a good example of the difference in the bullying thing.  Why bullying is so much worse, because imagine if you went home. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  And you turned off the internet, and just watched some fun TV, played with your old cat, and you just had a happy afternoon.  Yeah.  But you turn on the internet, and all these people are still right there.  They're right there.  And they're getting you upset.  I gotta come out.  And you gotta start tweeting, and you can never not be that guy.  It's the same thing where, if you're getting bullied in school, at least you could come home and play with your cat.  Right, Travis?  Travis?  Bullied?  Cat?  Comment?  And I would walk into my house, and just hug my cat. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  That's right.  Wondering who was singing Hava and Akilah Hava from the next room.  Sorry, Travis.  I wish you'll get when I made fun of Travis.  But, but if Travis had come home, and hugged his cat, and then turned on Twitter, and everybody was like,  you're still a little gay boy, he'd be like, oh, even my cat can't make me feel better.  Eh, maybe I'll just bleach my hair again.  You little, this'll be cool.  I'll look cool, and they'll like me now.  I did look cool.  You did look cool. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, there was no escaping it.  Yeah, that's the difference.  Yeah, you used to be able to go home, and okay, I don't have to deal with that again until, you know.  Yeah, there's no bully-free part of the internet that you could go to.  So, you're either not using social media at all, or you're gonna catch shit on it.  Like, imagine laying in bed.  You're a kid.  Oh, right?  Right?  You're having a tough time in school.  Yeah.  Everybody's bullying you.  You're laying in bed.  You turn the lights off.  You're like, okay, it's 11 p.m. 
[00:49:00]  I have nothing to worry about until tomorrow morning, finally.  And then, like, 11.30, your phone goes off.  It's just a text that says, hey, fuck yourself.  It's like, I can't escape this.  I'm home.  This was my sanctuary.  I'm in bed.  I'm being bullied in bed.  You knew when you left school and the bully gave you the last push in the mud puddle before you got on that school bus or walked off the school property and got home,  that you were safe from that time until at least you got on the bus the next morning and someone, Boomer Esiason, held your head and farted in your face. 
[00:49:30]  You knew.  Did that happen?  Oh, Jesus.  Did it ever.  He farted in your face?  Boomer used to do that to everyone.  Boomer would walk around the cafeteria of Timber Point Elementary School in East Islip and grab kids' heads, put them down by his ass, raise his leg, go, and then just laugh. 
[00:50:00]  He did it to you?  I think it happened to me at some juncture.  It was always like Russian roulette.  Yeah.  His ass was always loaded with one fart and you never knew who was going to go off and whose face.  Boomer was quite the bully.  I'll give him that.  Yeah.  In school, he was the gym teacher's pet.  He was very athletic, very big guy.  And he was what you would consider, especially back then, a bully. 
[00:50:30]  He'd walk around.  Everyone was afraid of him.  You didn't fuck with him.  You did not call him Norman.  He was Boomer back then, man.  His name was fucking Boomer.  And if you called him Norman, as I did, you were obligated to then fight him, as I did.  Did you win or lose?  I punched him square in the forehead, first punch of the fight, and broke my ulna and radius in my arm.  And now, a skinny little fucking girl, yes, a skinny little girl like myself, now is fighting the big Boomer with a broken arm. 
[00:51:00]  Which is just, I was the limping gazelle at the water hole with the mighty lion coming after me.  Did he ever fuck with you again after that?  No.  No.  Never again.  All you have to do is break your arm.  You throw a punch at somebody's face, it's a weird psychology.  You throw a punch at the face.  I felt so good for a split second that I felt so good. 
[00:51:30]  And, um, well then, you know.  I got my ass handed to me.  Thank God I kept my coat on, though.  I kept my big, dumb, 70s snorkel jacket on.  Remember those snorkel jackets?  And that, I kept it on.  Everyone used to strip their clothes off when they fought.  And I always thought, that's ridiculous.  I want padding.  Right.  So I kept the padding on.  But I'll tell you one thing.  It was a good old-fashioned schoolyard fight between two white kids. 
[00:52:00]  So there was no...  What does that have to do with it?  Well, there was no five other people coming in to stomp me on the head and steal my, uh,  not invented cell phone yet.  Right.  Yes.  But see, like a man, you run home.  Uh-huh.  Away from Boomer.  Right.  And once you finally get to your front door and shut the door...  Yes.  ...home free.  Home free.  Imagine...  Home free.  ...you run home.  Right.  You shut the door.  Oh.  Home free.  You walk into the kitchen.  You pour yourself a bowl of Froot Loops or whatever your cereal of choice is. 
[00:52:30]  Delicious.  And then you get a tweet that says, you're fucking dead.  Oh, I'd be like, what happened?  Why is it still here?  Oh, how's your arm, faggot?  Right.  How about that?  I'm like, wait a minute.  When did Boomer get Twitter?  What happened?  Yeah, well, you're going on Facebook.  It's the constant...  We've all gotten pounded online before, and you feel like everyone is in on it.  Like, even though...  Uh-huh.  Like, you ever been getting killed for something?  You're like, oh my God, everyone's in a room getting me.  Yeah.  Yes.  Because you don't realize that the people who don't hate you aren't aware that this is 
[00:53:00]  happening.  So they're not there to say, hey, just so you know, I don't hate you.  That doesn't happen.  No, why would you?  Why would you tweet somebody randomly and say...  You just wouldn't.  Hey, buddy, I don't hate you.  Right.  It's just got to be worse now, though.  I mean...  I never thought of that angle about going home, because I was always like, well, you  just block people.  But that's a good point about how you fucking...  You can't stop it.  There's no escape.  It's always...  And our lives are so online. 
[00:53:30]  You can't stay off the computer.  Did you ever bully anybody?  Ever?  Maybe a couple of weaker kids, but not much.  Yeah.  Like, uh...  No, I was always trying to stave off the fact that I was a cocksucker.  And just fucking, uh...  I was always just trying to be funny and not be bullied myself.  You ever bully anybody?  Yeah.  I didn't realize I was bullying people.  But in hindsight, I feel really bad about it.  Because I used to...  Yeah.  Like, there'd be select kids that were fun to make fun of. 
[00:54:00]  Yes!  And I would do it all the time.  I almost blame them for being such fucking dickbags that...  It's like, why are you making me do this to you?  Yeah.  Sam and I were incredibly similar as high school students.  Except you were gay.  Right.  But that's why I bullied.  Oh!  I get it.  So that people wouldn't put their attention on me.  Right.  And that's the other thing.  Yeah, like, I was small and weird looking.  Aww.  So you had to build yourself up by shitting on someone else.  And just immediately start firing.  Right, right.  And there'd be people that were fun to make fun of. 
[00:54:30]  And I would do it every day, all day.  It's like, uh, Welcome to the Dollhouse.  You ever see that movie?  Yes.  Fucking great.  It's great.  And the shit that goes downhill.  Like, no matter how badly someone's being bullied, and how bad they feel about being bullied,  they will turn around and fuck with the next dickhead down the ladder to them.  Because it just makes them feel a little better.  It's a really good, sick kind of indie flick from the 90s.  It was good.  Yeah, yeah.  You got braces, right? 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  She was just the most pathetic thing.  But I fell into that thing, too, where there were a couple of instances when I was in school,  one in elementary school, another one even in high school, where you get caught up in it.  Someone is such a complete fucking douchebag.  Not even mean or anything.  They're just like, ugh.  I don't even, I don't know why, but I feel compelled to push you.  Right.  And throw your sneakers in the mud.  Yeah. 
[00:55:30]  And shit like that.  Because you're a dick, and everyone does this, and it seems fun.  Like, there is something entertaining about fucking with somebody.  Well, it just feels powerful.  Yes!  It's a powerful thing.  It's not you.  No, it's not you getting pushed in the mud.  Yeah, like we had this kid in our neighborhood, and I can't help the amount of times.  Oh, this kid really trapped.  Was it a he, girl, boy, him rhymed with Travis?  Did he have a cat? 
[00:56:00]  I bet it's Travis.  Oh, fucking Chip.  Thank you, Wes, Chip.  But I can't count the amount of times we sent him home crying, like, just playing.  And then you'd laugh as he cried.  That's hilarious.  He's crying again.  Ha-ha, he went home crying.  We've reached our goal, everyone.  We made him cry.  You think about it now, and you're like, God damn.  Yeah, I destroyed that person's life.  He had a terrible childhood because of me.  Yes.  You're oblivious at that age to other people's feelings.  Yeah.  You don't understand that.  Like, I remember in seventh grade, there were these mean girls. 
[00:56:30]  Oh.  And they told me a list of all the boys that all these girls had crushes on.  Oh, man.  And they were like, you should send out an email and send it to everybody that has all  this information on it.  And I was like, yeah, that'd be funny.  And so I did it.  Uh-oh.  And, like, every girl was furious with me, and I couldn't understand why.  Ha-ha, you asshole.  And then later I realized that was a real fucking dick thing for me to do.  Yeah, yeah.  The, the, when you think back, though, before any of the internet and stuff, and, and, and 
[00:57:00]  the fact that I did it, and other people bullied kids, the, the immediacy of the ability  to bully people online now is just astounding.  So, um, you understand how, like, some of these kids are fucking offing themselves.  Yeah.  Which is crazy.  Imagine, like, I, I even felt bad after the fact.  Like, like, there was this fucking kid, I've talked about it before, poor Patrick, Patrick  Fullan.  Patrick Fullan.  And he was a fat, fucking cherub face, rosacea looking douchebag that made the funniest face 
[00:57:30]  when you punched him in the stomach.  Just the funniest dumb face.  And, and everyone punched him in the stomach to make him do the face.  Do the face.  Wham!  And you punch him in the stomach.  And I just, like, even afterwards, I go home and kind of be like, like this very show.  Mm-hmm.  When you, when you're here, everything's hunky-dory.  It's funny.  The second I'm getting into my truck, I might feel a little bad about what I said, uh, while 
[00:58:00]  I sit here.  Same thing.  Poor Patrick Fullan.  Why'd I make Bobo take his pants off again?  Right.  Exactly.  But then you see, then you see Patrick tomorrow, and you're like, it'd be really funny if I  punched him in the stomach right now.  Gotta see that face!  But you also, you never forget being bullied.  And you don't realize, because I'll never forget, in kindergarten.  Oh, no.  My first day of kindergarten in England.  Someone dropped the N-bomb, right?  No.  Oh.  But that's probably what they did. 
[00:58:30]  These three boys came up to me, and they said, we hate you.  What?  And I went, what?  Did they sound like the Wall album?  We hate you!  No, they were-  Oh, and oh, it's just another brick in the wall!  We hate you, little American pecker!  Yeah.  No?  They were American.  Yeah.  What?  Yeah, yeah.  I went to an American school in England.  You're living on an Air Force base?  Sam wanted to have some pudding, and they said, you can't have your pudding until you've 
[00:59:00]  eaten your meat.  You can't have your pudding until you've eaten your meat.  I'm gonna kick you in your twigs and berries!  No?  No.  Oh.  They punched me in the stomach, though, after they said they hated me.  Did you make a funny face?  I went, boom!  I'll tell the kids out there, if someone punches the stomach, do not make a funny face.  Because they will do what he can.  Because they will just, tomorrow, right back at you.  But that was kind of the end of it.  Yeah.  But even that one isolated incident stayed with me forever.  You remember.  Forever.  And you'll never forget-  Did you call a Bobby? 
[00:59:30]  No, I didn't call a Bobby.  You didn't call the Bobby's on him?  No.  They were utterly defenseless.  They had no firearms.  He'd have come and gone, what's all this, then?  Because that's what they say.  All right, all right.  All right, all right.  What's all this, then?  And I imagine that every single day.  Yeah.  They all look like the Artful Dodger.  Yeah.  They're all fucking, like, urchins.  They have newsy hats on.  Yeah.  I mean, you realize it's-  No, I was just gonna, you know,  It was nothing!  You know, like they're fucking-  All right, separate.  From the south side of town. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  Ah, that's a fair call.  It was nothing.  I did.  And you realize the cops are like clockwork orange cops,  and then they take you and they put your face in the trough.  You think they're rescuing you?  Poor little Sam in England.  Well, well, well.  Yeah, well, well, well.  Little Sam Roberts.  What have we got here?  Well, well.  I just looked up at him, not blinking.  Right.  Those piercing blue eyes. 
[01:00:30]  Ah.  Well, well, well, well.  Little Sam doesn't have any wobbles, does he?  No?  Did that happen?  Homeless man came up to me and got his comeuppance.  Yes.  Aw.  And did you catch some old lady because she hit your giant penis statue?  Did you engage in some ultraviolence as a kid?  I was.  I was.  Ultraviolence?  Walking around with all my clothes in a brown paper.  Yes.  Pull it up in brown paper with a ribbon. 
[01:01:00]  Did someone try to save you from yourself?  Did you try the wine?  No, but I would go up to girls and ask if they wanted to lure the old in-out-in-out.  Ah, yes.  What have you got at home to play your fuzzy wobbles on?  Well, she's in your liquor ice cream and she punches you in the face.  Little Sam Roberts in England.  I was so pissed.  My mom, I was gone from the house and she gave away my pet snake that I kept in a drawer.  Oh, no. 
[01:01:30]  That's right.  What did she do that for?  It's kind of mean.  Because it was a battery-operated snake that he would shove in his anus.  Aw.  I love the vision of the future in that movie.  It's micro-cassettes.  It really is.  Micro-cassettes was...  Micro-cassettes is what we're playing music off of.  I did like the fact in Clockwork Orange that they did kind of make this futuristic vision  that it kind of was...  You could believe it.  Yeah.  It wasn't so wacky far in the future.  Flying cars. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, flying cars and everything.  People walking around.  It was just this weird...  You felt like it was the future and the government was all fucked up and, you know, there was this  weird thing going on.  But you didn't...  They didn't have to put rocket ships in it to be like, hey, look, it's the future.  Look, people hang out with robots now.  Right.  Yeah, hey, robot, get me something.  And the micro-cassettes were actually a pretty fucking insightful thing for 1971.  But even though we passed that technology, they were around for a while.  Yeah, yeah.  Those little teeny cassettes.  Oh, I remember those. 
[01:02:30]  Sure, sure.  Back when they were playing big records, that seemed like this amazing portable piece of music.  Amazing technology.  Weirdo comes over and tries to give me advice while I'm in my tighty-whities walking around  the house.  Yes.  Your chief collective advisor.  Yeah.  Going to the milk bar.  Yeah.  How great was that?  That was fucking great.  I heard Jared Leto, somebody...  Oh, maybe somebody on our show said that he owns one of those little...  That's him?  Yeah.  He's a weird guy.  One of the figures from the Carova.  We met Jared Leto at one of the comedy shows. 
[01:03:00]  One of the...  Was it at...  It was in West Palm.  Oh, West Palm, right?  When you had to intro that concert they were doing.  Yes!  That's where he was.  He was all fucking weird makeup on and everything.  Because he was in band mode.  Well, I guess he's permanently in band mode now.  I haven't seen him in a movie.  He's an American psycho.  Jordan Catalano was a long time ago.  Mm-hmm.  Yes.  Requiem for a Dream was good.  Yep.  Yeah, he's been good.  Yeah, you like him? 
[01:03:30]  He's so handsome.  He is dreamy.  Yeah, he's dreamy.  Those eyes.  I'm going to give you that.  Everybody...  Yep, definitely.  Agreed, agreed.  We should take a break.  Yeah.  I got some wonderful breakfast here.  I would love the listeners to hear me eat it, but we're going to...  Oh, look at that.  Wow.  What's that?  Jordan Catalano.  Is that Jared Leto?  Yeah.  My so-called life.  Okay.  Exactly.  Did you watch that show?  I really liked that show.  Oh, of course you did.  Oh, joy.  I thought Jim did, too.  I was more of a Party of Five guy myself. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, Party of Five.  What a loser.  Well, you know what?  Fuck.  Uh, hot.  Come on.  I guess, uh, Travis and I were like, uh, grunge-era kids at that time, and you were  like, 42?  Hey.  I don't think I was, uh, 42.  I'm bad with me.  But, you know, I'd rather say that than say what else I was watching, like Clarissa explains  it all.  You were?  Oh, I loved Clarissa.  We were watching that, too. 
[01:04:30]  Clarissa was the shit.  I loved watching Clarissa.  Because the kid who came in the window was named Sam, and I was like, I wish I was as  cool as that, Sam.  Exactly.  You should be coming in the window.  That's what you should be doing, just jerking off and fling shrubs.  I used to love, uh, Nickelodeon.  I watched Clarissa.  Secret World of Alex, man.  I watched, uh, no, I watched, uh, Pete and Pete.  Pete and Pete's a great show.  Um, I watched some of the cartoons, fucking, um, Football Head, they're, uh, Hey Arnold.  Hey Arnold. 
[01:05:00]  I was talking about this the other day.  Like, those, Nickelodeon's, uh, shows when, when we were growing up were, were written so  smart, and they were written so well, they didn't talk down to kids.  And now the shit that's on Nickelodeon now, it's, it's, it's just, it's that.  What, you mean, you mean overacting kids being smart-alecks to their parents?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  That whole thing, it's, yeah, I don't get it.  That whole, like, fucking, the kids, and, yeah, they're smart-alecks.  I always wanted to be cool Sam coming through the window, but I always knew I was more like 
[01:05:30]  Ferguson.  Oh, you were Ferguson.  I knew.  Ferguson was the douche.  He was a fucking douche.  What a great name.  Ferguson.  Yeah.  Oh, look at him.  Fucking.  I knew, I knew.  He's one of those Daywalker gingers.  Good head of hair on that little bastard, though.  Oh, big red head.  He's probably fucking completely bald now.  Oh, he is.  Yep.  Wait a minute.  He is.  He looks like that gay gymnast. 
[01:06:00]  Moby?  Or the radio wizard.  He looks like Seth Green.  Or Seth Green with a shaved head.  How did he lose that big, full head of red hair?  He started losing it, and he just got rid of it, because there's nothing worse than  wispy red hair.  No, but only some people can shave that shit.  Man.  So you got a good fucking shaved head, Jim.  Thank you.  Nice shape to it and everything.  Some people, they shave their head.  It just fucking screams chemotherapy.  Yeah, I got a pale watermelon perched on my neck. 
[01:06:30]  You can't have that.  You can't have it.  Oh, it's great.  Nothing in it.  I knew, too.  My brother fucking pulls off the shaved head.  Yeah.  Fine.  He can fucking pull it off.  He grows mutton chops and a beard and fucking the shaved head, and it's fine.  Me, I had to spend whatever money I had to, to keep every little fucking bit of hair on  the top of my head, because the shaved head, for me, an undertaker would be following me 
[01:07:00]  around, thinking I had mere hours left.  Can't pull it off.  If you grow a goatee and scowl a lot, people would think you're like Walter White.  No.  Walter White, another one that pulled off that fucking shaved head thing perfectly.  Uh, I just don't have it.  No.  I don't have that look.  The shaved head, it saved a multitude of bald guys.  And black dudes.  I mean, black dudes got it.  Any black dude can pull it off.  Any black dude can pull off the shaved head. 
[01:07:30]  Black women can pull it off since Uhuru.  Uhuru?  Was she bald or no?  Uhura?  Uhura.  Was she bald or no?  No, she had a full head of hair.  Who am I thinking of a bald black woman?  I'm thinking of somebody that I can't remember the name.  Uh.  I have no idea.  Every one of them, if you take the weaves out their head.  Well, they're fucking weak.  No, I'm thinking of somebody that I can't.  All right.  I can't, uh, let me see.  Does anyone know?  Erykah Badu?  No, she didn't have a bald head.  She had a giant.  Grace Jones?  No. 
[01:08:00]  Grace Jones was bald.  Grace Jones had, uh, no, she had like a mohawk thing.  She had a fade.  I'm very short.  She had a fade.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  She had a head of hair on her.  Yeah.  She's very pretty.  Who used to bang her?  Sting?  Or no, no, Sting, um...  Who used to bang Grace Jones?  Oh, yeah.  Who banged Grace Jones?  There was, uh, a white dude, right?  I'm thinking of David Bowie and Iman.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Or Iman.  Not Iman.  Iman.  They're still married, I think.  Are they really?  Yeah.  Dolph Lundgren.  Did Dolph used to bang her? 
[01:08:30]  That would have been an awesome photo.  Right?  Holy shit.  Imagine what that would look like, the contrast.  Yeah.  Fucking, you wouldn't need any fucking Instagram filters on that picture.  Chiseled jaws.  Fucking.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Being intimidating.  What the hell am I doing?  I gotta eat.  All right.  We'll be right back.  And, uh, yo, stay tuned.  Fuck.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  On SiriusXM.  The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:09:00]  On SiriusXM.  Oh, what up, my niggas and niggas.  Niggas and niggas.  There's another O.P. and Anthony Show radio.  Niggas.  Niggas.  Oh.  Could you at least just say what, uh, because Gene, I guess, was really weird about certain  things, and what you and Ace would do to Gene while he was sitting there putting his  makeup on?  Well, we'd kind of put them on his shoulder.  You know, we'd...  I mean, at this, you know, at this, at this part of our lives, it was a constant erection. 
[01:09:30]  I mean, everything, you didn't need any Viagra, trust me.  And we would sit and get bored, you know, because it would be, back in our day, was you  work, you do an album, you go out and push the album.  Back in the radio days, you had it, that's what you did.  We did, it was, there was no, we didn't have computers, you didn't have the internet, so  you constantly recorded, you constantly toured with the album, and that's all we ever did.  Out of boredom, one night I was making up, and I got an erection, and I said, you know, 
[01:10:00]  I'm going to go over to Gene and put this on his shoulder.  And so he was making up, and also he kind of looks at him, oh, and he freaks out.  And then Ace got the idea, and so Ace came over and put it on his other shoulder.  And so he's like, oh, you guys, but he didn't really freak out and throw us away and push  us away.  Not that I'm indicating anything, but he actually, after a while, I think got a really big kick  out of this little game we would play with him.  We never did it to Paul.  No, why not?  I don't know. 
[01:10:30]  Just because, I don't know.  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  Oh, okay.  Oh, a little hotter than hell.  Is that what this is?  Any reason for this, Mr. Rock?  Only because it's Kiss and Jimmy. 
[01:11:00]  39 years ago, this is really easy.  Kiss and Jimmy, I bet you wish you were.  Ah, look out.  Kiss, huh?  Yeah.  I realized when I went to see Kiss that time they were around, and we all went to see him,  how few Kiss songs I really know.  Really?  Like, I know their hit hits.  Their big hits.  And those are kind of few, if you really think about it.  And, um, they played a lot of songs.  I was just like, what the fuck is this? 
[01:11:30]  I don't even know this song.  One of my favorite Kiss songs off of Dress to Kill.  It's called Getaway.  Peter Chris.  Peter Chris sang a couple of great fucking Kiss songs.  Do you know he did that?  I did not know that.  You know, it was supposed to be Beck, from what I hear.  That's right.  And Gene saved the whole universe, apparently, by...  All of its success hinged on Gene Simmons.  Always on Gene.  Is this the song you were just talking about, Gene?  Oh, Getaway, yeah, yeah.  Getaway? 
[01:12:00]  I like a lot of Kiss songs.  I wouldn't know this.  This is like a...  Are they dressed to kill at Rock and Roll All Night on it?  It's a very basic song.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I just like Peter Chris and listen.  I think that he never got the accolades.  A little riff.  Very common riff right there.  I've been trying to get away, to get away, to leave this old town.  I've been trying to see my way, to see my way, so I won't be found.  Many times I felt alone, I felt alone, but that's only one thing I know. 
[01:12:30]  I know.  Have a one, you know?  See, this is...  It's very generic, but it works.  It's a very generic song, yeah.  Well, I don't think so.  It's very old.  Well, it is old.  I've been ripping this off since 1974.  I don't care for it.  I think they've been ripping this riff off since...  Yeah.  Like in the 30s.  Very good. 
[01:13:00]  A little kiss.  I had to...  I had to get my sleep study last night.  Yes, I wanted to ask you how that went.  Everybody is, ooh, in a tizzy, wondering how your sleep study went to me.  I do understand nobody cares, but I had to get...  No!  I went...  I was on no sleep yesterday, so I went to...  I had to get...  I wanted to get one Ambien for my study.  Because they put you...  You probably have 30 wires attached to you.  How do you get one Ambien?  I have my doctor prescribe it.  I went to my doctor, and I asked her to prescribe one. 
[01:13:30]  One Ambien, please!  I did that last year.  I wanted one pill.  But she wrote it up for a regular prescription, so I get to the pharmacy, and the guy goes,  well, this is for 30.  Oh, shit!  And I'm like, I only want one.  Bring some friends.  And he's like, no, well, I have to give you the whole thing.  Oh.  So I walked home with 30 Ambien.  And fucking immediately, 29 of them went in the toilet.  Really?  Before I fucking took my shoes off, 29 Ambien down the toilet.  Wow.  Is it that you didn't trust yourself? 
[01:14:00]  Absolutely, I don't trust yourself.  Because there's this junkie mentality of, like, it's like, I'm going to take one for  this study.  Uh-huh.  But then I'm like, you know, you might want to save one, because if this one doesn't work,  Oh, boy.  then you're going to have to get into the sleep study.  And I'm like, shut up, douchebag.  You go to the doctor again, you get the prescription.  Or what if you slept very soundly after you took it?  And then you'd be like, well, you know what?  I could just take another one, make myself sleep a little better.  I have such a, I think a lot of the listeners, too, has such faith in you, like, and your 
[01:14:30]  sobriety.  You talk about, and I listen to your advice show, and you talk about how it's a daily  struggle, and you still, you know.  We're vigilant.  Sometimes it's not a struggle.  It's like a daily vigilance.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But, uh, it's like nobody can picture you sliding.  And it can happen.  Believe me.  I understand that.  It's like one of those things.  But, I mean, I don't think there's really anybody out there that could picture you sliding,  uh, because you seem very, very together when it comes to your sobriety. 
[01:15:00]  Everything else is fucking whack.  You're a fucking lunatic.  But, uh, that sobriety thing, I think it would crush a lot of people.  If you ever did a slip.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, but it's amazing how your mind works after all these years.  It doesn't just say, take, uh, five and get fucked up, man.  It doesn't say that.  Yeah.  Because my mind, you know, it's like too basic a fucking, but it's like, just save one.  Right.  Um, there was the one point when I was holding the thing, I'm like, you could just take all 
[01:15:30]  these and you'd be dead.  Oh my God.  I wasn't going to do that, but I'm just like the power in your hand right now.  I very rarely have that shit.  It probably also helped you to get rid of them spending the morning with Jenna Jameson.  Yeah.  You know, but that doesn't really matter.  Cause again, I've seen so many people in worse shape than her.  That was just, that's just one of many people you see having a rough day.  And ambient is any, I mean, it's pretty ill potente as they say, but, uh, it's not like  you have a morphine in your hands or anything, you know, maybe I couldn't have killed myself. 
[01:16:00]  But still, but still, you know, that, that mentality was there where you're like, and  I couldn't get it down the toilet.  I took, I saved one out of the 30 and they wouldn't flush.  A big log you fucking put in there.  Dude, they were all sticking to the fucking, I'm flushing and I come back and there's 20  of them still stuck to the bottom of my toilet.  So I took my shit on them and knocked them loose.  Very symbolic.  That was what I did.  I kept taking, I took a fucking awful post-workout veggie juice dump on them and knocked them  loose.  Oh shit. 
[01:16:30]  And I get there at fucking 8 PM and it's not like the other place I went.  You don't have your own bathroom.  You have to share a bathroom.  With who?  Just whoever else is up there.  Other people?  A medical area.  It's like a sleep study.  And it's like the day room at Rikers Island.  There's like fucking six black guys watching a football game being loud.  And I'm like, oh, this is a fucking nightmare.  Were they working there or a study?  A couple of them were working, but the other ones were there for other kinds of studies.  They had people that do like volunteer, I guess a paid.  Crime study is right.  Or just brainwave stuff and sleep. 
[01:17:00]  Oh boy.  Beep.  So I had to wait two hours to get, I'm like, how long will it take you to put all the wires  on me?  And the guy's like, I got about 40 minutes.  Jesus.  So a lot of wires.  He put a bunch.  I took a cold medicine because I was very congested in coffee.  And I took, I bit the Ambien in half.  I took half of the one pill I had.  And that fucking mask went on me.  And I slept.  I kept waking up.  I can only sleep a little bit.  Yeah.  I'm a bad fucking sleeper, man. 
[01:17:30]  That's a goddamn fucking bitch.  On cold medicine and a half an Ambien.  And I don't indulge at all.  Yeah.  And I still kept waking up every fucking hour.  And I went and pissed a couple times.  You have to carry all these wires with you.  And oh, it's a fucking nightmare, dude.  How do you not knock the wires off while you're sleeping?  You're just laying there.  I was laying on my back still.  You don't move.  I can't move.  I can't sleep on my back like that.  I can't either.  I need to be curled up.  Yeah.  Fetal position.  Yeah.  Yes.  I think he got enough data. 
[01:18:00]  And then it was like 3 o'clock in the morning.  I woke up.  I'm like, I'm awake.  There's no...  I wasn't going to take the rest of the pill.  Is somebody awake like monitoring the whole time?  They're watching you on a camera.  You just speak out loud in the room.  And I'm like, I got to pee.  I got to pee.  And I guess he was with another patient.  So I just unplugged myself and went.  And I'm like, I'm not going to sleep again.  And I made myself lay there.  You must sleep, Mr. Norton.  You must sleep and eat.  Eat for the trip, Mr. Norton.  And it's a cookbook.  It's a cookbook. 
[01:18:30]  So I got a little more sleep.  But I'm hoping I got enough data, man.  I'm done with these cunting sleep studies.  Yeah.  But the mask, you said, was working.  It was the machine that I needed.  It was called the ASV machine.  And it was so much more comfortable than the other ones.  What does that do differently?  When it senses I stop breathing completely because of my central apneas, it breathes for me.  It calls your family and congratulates them.  It writes serious a letter and buys stock options for this guy. 
[01:19:00]  Wow.  I'll know the results, whatever.  But hopefully I see.  How long before you don't know?  God, that white gunk on me.  Bitch.  Yeah, I see that.  Like, what is that?  Glue from the fucking...  Yeah, they have to fucking exfoliate like 30 different spots on your body and rub it  with alcohol and then put these fucking...  It's like being hooked up to a...  God.  It's like you're a test dummy.  That's what you're hooked up to.  Yeah, you are at that point.  Without the test part.  Yeah.  Just a non-breathing dummy.  Oh, shit.  Well, good luck, Jimmy. 
[01:19:30]  Thank you.  I'm going to talk about this guy.  Remember the guy, the Jets fan?  He popped that fucking Patriots chick in the face at the game the other day.  Apparently, he's been a very bad boy over the years.  This guy, Kurt Paschke.  Paschke.  Kurt Paschke.  And yeah, he's the guy who's caught on video punching this chick.  Chick got in his face.  You know, we talked about it yesterday. 
[01:20:00]  It's never good to pop a girl in the face.  But as Chris Rock said in one of his very funny comedy bits,  I understand.  I understand.  You can't kill a bit, but I understand.  Oh, did you, Chip?  Yeah.  When?  What was the context?  My mother was getting the floorboards fixed by Lamar.  I'm like, what are you doing?  She's like, you wouldn't understand.  I'm like, I understand.  That's not even close to what Chris Rock was talking about. 
[01:20:30]  And it never happened.  Chip, fuck you.  Good.  Just, I've had it.  Yeah, so this guy, now they kind of reached back in history.  And when he was 17 years old, he stabbed someone and killed them.  What?  So apparently he has a little anger issue. 
[01:21:00]  He did three years in the journey for killing somebody.  He, this guy, first of all, he's from Long Island.  Now, I take pride in being from Strong Island, as they call it.  Strong Island.  But man, what a collection of douchebags has come from this little strip of real estate  to the east of New York City.  This guy is the typical Long Island dickbag.  Everything from his high school yearbook picture to the video of him punching a chick in the 
[01:21:30]  face spells douchebag.  I'm curious if he's a fan of the show because I'm not sure he is.  I'm getting word that one of our former interns is friends with him, and he's giving me his  number right now.  Which intern?  Paul.  Paul.  Which one was that?  He also worked here for a period of time.  We almost hired him.  Oh yeah, Paul with the bandana.  Oh, bandana Paul.  His mother made better fucking snacks than Sam's mother. 
[01:22:00]  He doesn't work here anymore?  No, we hired Sal instead of him.  But I thought he was working here.  Nope.  He was good.  We erred in judgment.  We really did.  You think so?  We got Sal.  We got Sal.  Sal, I'm behind your hiring 100%, and I think you're doing good.  Why is that?  That's a mugshot.  Because when he walks in with a pistol, I want him to know who not to shoot.  Oh.  Yeah.  Gotta watch that.  Yeah, so, um...  Wow, he knows it.  Wow, that's fucking cool.  I hope we get his number. 
[01:22:30]  But I'm just gonna say, he looks like one of these Long Island douchebags.  It's even more of a reason not to punch a woman in the face at a public event.  Right?  If in your past, you've stabbed and killed somebody.  You do three years for killing somebody.  And I guess he claimed self-defense.  His mother has been coming to this guy's defense.  Of course she has.  And this is another one of these typical fucking things.  Mothers are fucking assholes.  Gotta be honest with you.  They just jumped to the defense of their fucking putrid little offspring, no matter what. 
[01:23:00]  And this guy is no exception.  She, um...  No exception, excuse me.  She said that the stabbing involved some white supremacist or something that was hassling him.  And he stabbed him.  And he's white.  Yeah, I know.  I don't get it.  I don't get it.  This is his Jetsmobile, by the way.  He owns that.  Oh, he takes that to the tailgate.  This guy.  I'm sure he's got a man cave in his mom's house. 
[01:23:30]  It's a short bus.  It's like a...  It's like a...  Oh, does he look like a fucking douche?  It's a school bus that's painted white and has the Jets logo all over it.  Look, there's this pal flipping the bird.  He's flipping the bird.  By the way, if you...  Bad backyard from fucking the South Shore.  Doesn't give a fuck.  If you're over 13 and you think you're cool giving the middle finger in a photo, you're an ass.  Yeah.  Yes.  How else do you prove that you're badass in a single photo?  Yeah.  Jetsmobile. 
[01:24:00]  Jetsmobile is pretty good.  It says Jetsmobile on it, too.  I hope he gets sued for using the logo without permission.  I bet he drives that to the games, right?  And then other Jets fans beep, and he looks at him out the window and goes,  Yeah!  He wants to be one of those celebrity superfans.  Jetsmobile guy is here.  He wants to be the new fireman, Ed.  But instead, he's the guy who punched a woman in the face at a Jets game.  He's just the stab-happy guy.  You know the Jetsmobile?  What?  Oh, I think I saw that at a tailgate.  That's mine. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, man.  You're a Jetsmobile guy?  Yeah.  That's me.  Now the Jetsmobile is synonymous with stabbing people and beating women.  And punching women in the face.  In the face.  So his mom rallies behind him and says that he was defending her.  I guess, Mom, this is a family affair.  The Jetsmobile can haul the entire family to the game, apparently.  So the mom was there.  And the line they're using is that he was defending his mom. 
[01:25:00]  From what?  When he punched that waifish Pats fan in the face.  Who did shove him.  Yeah, I understand.  I understand.  But, you know, if you're that big and a skinny fucking chick pushes you,  you respond in kind, perhaps.  You push her back a little.  Maybe you grab her arms and say, knock it off.  You turn to the guy and say, control your chick, you faggot.  Right.  Something.  But he decided to step it right up to punch her in the face. 
[01:25:30]  If you're a big galoot from Long Island.  He is a goon, isn't he?  Who drives a Jetsmobile.  All right, look.  You've got to take the good with the bad.  The Jetsmobile is pretty awesome.  Well, it's badass.  It is badass.  Do you want to guess what the theme of his birthday cake this year was?  J-E-T-S, Jets, Jets, Jets.  He loves the Jets.  Oh, does he love the Jets?  When the Daily News went to his mom's house to interview her,  there was a half-eaten Jets-themed birthday cake for her son. 
[01:26:00]  How can somebody like the Jets that much?  You'd think that going to a Jets game would be the happiest they'll ever be.  No.  This is my mecca.  Yeah, they won the game, and he still is leaving the building,  punching women in the face on his way out.  I wonder if the guy he stabbed bled Jets green.  Or if it was just regular red blood gushing out of him  until he collapsed and died on the floor.  I'm not sure.  I just gave Eric a phone number.  We're going to see if it's him.  Oh, well, do tell. 
[01:26:30]  Do tell.  I don't know if he'll talk.  Pending charges.  I'm sure there are pending charges.  Tell him it's the Boomer and Carton show.  He'll talk to Boomer.  That's true.  He probably loves the Boomer.  We'll just tell him, you know, throw the middle fingers up.  What's this guy's first name?  Kurt.  Kurt.  Kurt.  Tell Kurt, if he asks, just tell him we just want to say fuck the haters.  Fuck you!  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  If we're saying fuck the haters, he'll be like,  all right, put me through.  Kurt.  Tell him we got some Jets cake for him.  Yeah.  Yeah, we want to pimp his Jets mobile. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  Look at that.  Big Jets flag.  Exhibit.  Big American flag.  Chip, you like it?  Fuck yeah.  Cool.  You like football, Chip?  I don't give a fuck.  Oh, I forgot.  It's painted Jets green and white.  Yeah.  Jets mobile is awful.  You don't like it?  No, I don't.  It's a short bus.  It is.  It's a short bus.  It's a big Jets flag.  How will you stop with the Jets?  Oh, does he love the Jets?  But he drives a short bus to a Jets game.  Season ticket holder.  Yeah.  Normally takes his dad to the games, but mom went on Sunday because she's a breast cancer 
[01:27:30]  survivor.  Oh, my God.  October is the month for raising awareness.  I bet you that the Jets revoke his season tickets if there's a problem.  Oh, man.  That would be awful for him.  He should take his bus away.  Somebody goes up to him and says, would you take the short bus here to this Jets game?  And he'd be like, yes, as a matter of fact, I did.  I did.  I did.  I did take the short bus.  It's the Jets mobile.  It's the Jets mobile, though.  Yeah.  Didn't you see?  It's parked out there.  Yeah.  Pretty cool, huh?  Telegating.  What happened?  Voicemail.  Voicemail?  Yeah, we'll try again.  What does it say?  Hey, fuck. 
[01:28:00]  If you're a bitch, leave your message so I could come over the house and punch you in  the face.  Yeah, a little manslaughter charge, I guess, he got for stabbing.  Man, if you stab and kill someone and do three years.  Yeah, keep your hands to yourself at that point.  That right there ends your career of fucking with people, physically.  You shouldn't even want to draw attention to yourself anymore.  Like, he shouldn't even be driving the Jets mobile at that point.  It'd be like, oh, that's the guy that stabbed that guy. 
[01:28:30]  Exactly.  The Jets mobile.  It's not like there's two Jets mobiles out there.  What do you mean, the stab mobile?  Yeah, he calls it the Jets mobile, but we know, we know.  We all know what it is.  It's the manslaughter mobile.  Yeah.  Yeah, mom's, like, that blind fucking support for kids.  Mom's saying it was self-defense.  I don't know what that's all about.  That those Pats fans jumped them.  Oh, yeah.  That's what she's saying.  Were they just arguing and they got jumped?  That happens sometimes, too.  You're arguing with people and they take a swing at you. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  She said they were tormented by a pack of obnoxious Patriots fans.  At a football game?  That doesn't sound right.  But in Jets Stadium, really?  Sure, why not?  I mean, will the visitors really start fucking with their home team?  Yeah, have you ever gotten drunk before?  Never.  Yeah, I mean, absolutely.  Yeah.  All you need to do is get drunk and then these people just act like the assholes that they are.  You ever have mommy defend you?  Sorry, Trav, you're out of this. 
[01:29:30]  You ever have mommy defend you?  Oh, you fucking Sam Roberts.  For everything, I'm sure.  You should have heard, when I was in school, I told her that my band teacher, in sixth grade,  I played the drums in the band.  Oh, rock.  But in the stupid school band, not like a rock band.  And I couldn't even play.  Like, that's terrible.  I forgot my drumsticks half the time and just sat there.  You'd always practice on the skin flute.  It's not even a drum.  No, exactly.  That's why you were terrible at the drums.  Skin flute.  But an expert at the skin flute.  But my mom found out that on the first day of like sixth grade, he said, right now, you 
[01:30:00]  will all listen to me.  You are bottom feeding slime suckers.  And he went on this whole rant and that was the quote, I remember, bottom feeding slime  suckers.  And I told my mom.  Henry Sergeant Hartman.  Yeah.  Of drums.  Yeah.  And I told my mom.  Mm-hmm.  She made such a stink with the school.  Oh, man.  Such a stink.  One of those anti-bullying moms.  You're like, moms like yours are the ones who are responsible for this nonsense that 
[01:30:30]  everyone's dealing with.  Yeah.  She didn't like me being called a slime sucker.  Are you embarrassed that she did that?  No, no, no.  Because I got out of band class.  So I was fine with it.  Good deal.  They let me just sit in the guidance counselor's office for the whole period.  Because they knew there was a problem.  So I didn't mind it.  You're a douche.  A call.  Oh, do we?  Yeah.  Well, we should take it.  Sir, you're on the air.  Hi, Colin.  I was so afraid you guys were going to go, speaking of bottom feeding, slime suckers. 
[01:31:00]  Now that would have been good.  That would have been a real zinger.  Yes.  Colin Quinn.  I'm only calling because I understand there's a problem.  Speaking of bullying, I feel like Jim Norton is bullying Bobo about our touring.  Oh, God.  This is a Twitter fucking rock opera that's going on with Colin and Bobo.  Apparently, I don't know how Bobo got this idea, but Bobo is under the impression.  And I don't know who's encouraging it either. 
[01:31:30]  I have no idea.  Bobo is under the impression that there's...  I don't know how he got this idea.  Neither did the most find a neurologist.  Apparently, there's going to be this car tour.  Bobo and Colin are going to tour the country, stopping in cities near you, and go from New York  to L.A. together, and broadcast, and do call-ins to this program, and just have a great time. 
[01:32:00]  Well, he's had a bunch of great suggestions.  Yeah, he did.  A bunch of them, huh?  What are a couple of them, Carl?  Well, in each city, we stop, and we talk to a local person that we know in each state.  Now, how do you know people in various cities?  I know Bobo's never been out of New York, and, you know...  He's barely been out of Maspeth.  Yeah.  I know Colin tours around, but you don't really make friends and meet people. 
[01:32:30]  Well, some of the helpful Twitter followers have given suggestions,  how they'd like to meet up, and, you know, possibly bring weaponry.  Yes.  I did see that.  I kind of joined in on the fun, and posted a couple of video clips of what I perceive the trip will be like.  One was a clip of Maury being stabbed in the back of the head from Goodfellas.  I thought he'd never shut the fuck up.  I love that line. 
[01:33:00]  Another one, I wish you well on your trip, and hoped it went as well as the picture I posted.  And it, of course, was Kennedy with his head exploded, being cradled by his loving wife.  But, yeah, you're encouraging this.  I've seen that.  Well, I mean, I just felt bad because I heard Friday Bobo called in to kind of promote the tour,  and then she just eviscerated him.  It didn't go well.  We were in the middle of Jocktober. 
[01:33:30]  Things were happening.  And Bobo just called up at this non-sequitur about some car tour with Colin Quinn.  It is literally one self-centered, nonsensical moment after another.  And I fucking had my fill of it.  I know that Bobo is not the best decision maker, but in the middle of something else, it's just this fucking, just banal fucking,  We're going to be driving.  Shut up!  For fuck's sake! 
[01:34:00]  He is just fucking trying.  He is just so difficult to deal with and read his dumb tweets.  But he's like anybody else in the business.  He's trying to get his brand out there, and he has a critique in it, you know?  Well...  He's not slick at it, but he's a brand.  He is the master of self-promotion, the Bobo brand.  But now he wants to hitch his Bobo wagon to your star there, Carl, and travel the nation with you. 
[01:34:30]  I can picture it, though.  Mount Rushmore, the Grand Canyon, all the big attractions around this grand nation of ours.  The great Arch in St. Louis.  Being sullied forever in everyone's mind.  Oh, God.  I couldn't think of one interesting moment that that fucking trip would conjure up.  It would be the worst thing ever. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, Colin.  By the way, Colin Quinn, are you changing the name of Unconstitutional?  Because I loved the Touche.  When he called Unconstitutional, the Touche.  Oh, is that great.  It's like when I changed Ron Conkerman to the Cock.  The Cock?  Yes.  The Cock. 
[01:35:30]  You are just a bevy of these nicknames that I think could catch on.  Because the conk did kind of catch on with a lot of people.  The kids, specifically.  Carl, you know Long Island pretty well.  Did you see this kid that fucking at the Jets game?  Oh, yeah.  This kid, this guy.  That girl, right?  Yeah, he punched the girl in the face.  Apparently, when he was 17, he stabbed a guy and killed him and did three years in prison for that.  And he just looks like one of these typical Long Island dickbags from his yearbook picture with his dumb tuxedo shirt on. 
[01:36:00]  He has something called the Jetsmobile that he drives to the game.  It's a short bus, but it's painted jet green and white.  Well, maybe he's trying to replace Fireman Ed, you know?  I think he is.  You know what would be great, though?  Bobo and Colin going cross-country in the Jetsmobile.  Now, that would be something. 
[01:36:30]  Absolutely.  With that guy.  Imagine Bobo chanting J-E-T-S, Jets, Jets, Jets, Jets, no matter what city you go to.  And the guy who owns the Jetsmobile punching him in the face repeatedly.  That would be, or stabbing him.  He's been known to do that, too.  Even better.  Yeah, Colin.  So fucking bottom feeder.  So, Colin, when is this trip supposed to go down?  Is it going to be a summer trip?  Well, I'm in Charleston, South Carolina right now, so I'm just kind of, like, peeling people  out about Bobo on my trip, and they couldn't be enthusiastic. 
[01:37:00]  Feeling people out.  I saw some of your pics on Twitter there.  You went to some historic places?  Yes, I've been all over the place.  I saw you were at, like, an old church and a cemetery.  And what are you, looking at some Civil War shit?  Yeah, there's a lot of cool shit down here, man.  Yeah?  Unbelievable.  That is good.  You would love, Charles.  You ever go down here?  I've never been down there.  I've never replaced it.  Anthony Comey would settle.  It would be in this town.  Is that it?  Really?  Oh, boy.  It's a combination of things that you love. 
[01:37:30]  I know what that means.  Probably guns and complete segregation of the races.  Yeah, it's a combination.  Fucking liquor, gun store, fucking grammar school.  Yeah, those southern states, I've driven through them on my way to Florida.  That's about it.  But I've never really stopped off.  Yeah, south of the border.  Maybe me and Bobo are going to south of the border and get him a big sombrero.  That'd be funny.  A big sombrero.  And you could buy some fireworks. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  Shit like that.  I'm with you.  And he could light them off.  Yeah.  While you're dancing in a robe trying to sell coke, he could fucking light them off in  the background in his underpants.  I'm there.  That was...  He's Asian.  I liked your Jeff Foxworthy statue, too.  Oh, yeah.  Who was that?  Yeah, all the Civil War guys look like Jeff Foxworthy.  Every Civil War guy.  It's true.  They got that dumb mustache and that great head of hair. 
[01:38:30]  How's the South doing these days?  Are they still holding that grudge against the North?  A lot of Southern flags?  You don't know?  They love the touche.  That's all I'm going to say.  They love the touche.  God, do I love that.  When are you back in New York with the touche?  I want to go see it.  Oh, it's going to be a couple of weeks.  But I'll be...  I told you, the beauty of the touche is I'm not going to be in some foolish theater in  New York City.  I'll be in Bakeshore doing it.  You can come out there.  Oh, man. 
[01:39:00]  Nice.  You know what I'm saying?  Maybe we could punch some women.  It's all going towards...  All roads lead to Ron Conkler.  All roads.  The conk.  I'm psyched.  All right, guys.  Carl, thank you for the call.  Always a joy hearing from you.  Well, Jimmy, try to remember something.  Yes, that's cool.  You better get in on the bottom floor with this Bobo Collin tour.  Yeah, maybe.  I really shouldn't miss the boat.  I mean, it's right here being presented at my feet.  I should probably grab this opportunity. 
[01:39:30]  Bye, guys.  See you, buddy.  Take it easy, man.  There should be an app where you could keep track of where they are and everything.  That'd be great.  Oh, man.  Is he just fucking feeding Bobo this nonsense about this car trip?  And Collin doesn't know how dangerous it is.  Collin doesn't realize that he's setting himself up.  Like, Bobo is becoming obsessed.  Yeah, yeah.  And Collin is not going to shake Bobo anytime soon.  No! 
[01:40:00]  Like, Bobo is firmly implanted in Collin's life.  Right.  That, um...  Remember that girl that was here the other day?  That Linz girl?  She was here.  The little short girl.  Oh, from Boston.  Yeah, yeah.  Big fucking tits.  Yeah, yeah.  That was here.  Apparently, they went to that cancer benefit.  Right.  That Ottawa and George was at and Bob Levy and everything.  And she, like, took a picture and was hanging out and kind of talking to Bobo.  I told her, I go, it's over.  It's over for you.  He will probably not stop, uh, texting you, uh, or DMing you and, um, tweeting you. 
[01:40:30]  And you said big tits?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a problem.  Oh, yeah.  Bobo loves him some titties.  Bobo loves big tits.  Oh, yeah, he does.  Fuck does he love big tits.  Well, because he's not a smart man.  So it's just, whatever is the obvious there.  Like, oh, big tits is good.  Period.  A pinwheel.  Right.  Visual, visual things, colors.  If you can start making a balloon animal in front of him and twisting the... 
[01:41:00]  Oh, yeah.  He loves it.  Fascinated.  Yeah.  Fascinated.  Um, let's take a break.  We have two guests coming up.  We have two guests.  Yes, today, the, um, wonderful John Lithgow will be showing up later on.  Uh, but first we have, uh, DL.  Which one?  You think Colin's going to enjoy the John Lithgow interview?  I do, actually.  I do, actually.  No, Colin bashed us for our interviews.  Oh, I know.  I was here when he did it.  Yeah, and, um...  Who listens to him?  Well, I've got to be honest. 
[01:41:30]  Now, whenever we're doing an interview and I'm asking questions, all I think of is how  Colin is assessing my performance.  I wouldn't think of that, even if Colin was the guy I was interviewing.  I just can't get it out of my head when I ask a poignant question.  Uh, I think Colin is sitting there laughing, mocking me.  Well, let him, how about, you know, if it was a guy like Charlie Rose who called up.  Yeah, yeah.  I was going to say there's something to be said for that.  So you're saying a piece of shit like Colin shouldn't be given... 
[01:42:00]  He's a fucking, a sleep-deprived nothing with, like, little skinny camel legs.  All right.  Here's what he thinks.  He's a cyber bully.  He's a bully.  Colin's a bully.  He is a bully.  Okay.  He's mean-spirited.  I'll try to remember that as we talk to DL Hughley next, I gather.  I guarantee you DL smells good, too.  Always.  I always get great cologne ideas from DL.  You'll love the way the guests smell.  Sometimes, you know, Jenna smelled good.  You said Jenna smelled very good.  Must have been the tears.  Oh, Ant.  Girl tears.  They smell great.  Okay. 
[01:42:30]  We'll be back after these words.  Shut up, cunts.  It's Bobo time.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  On SiriusXM.  SiriusXM.  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Fucking garbage.  Want me to bring us back?  I'll do it well.  Do it up, Jim.  Welcome back.  Oh, that's nice. 
[01:43:00]  I don't like it.  To The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie, as we said it out today,  he has a weird thing  where he can't stop leaking pre-seminal fluid,  so he's at the doctors  trying to have that fixed.  His cum duct,  the thing that stops it from leaking,  is broken like a fucking  reflux flapping your throat.  Stop with this technical jargon.  The cum duct.  I thought it was a problem  with the vas deferens.  It might be.  The vas deferens is what it produces.  Opie is an abnormally thick  and productive vas deferens. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  Vas deferens.  He's a big inner cock vein.  Yeah, it's gotten to the point  where he keeps falling and slipping  in pre-seminal fluid.  Yeah.  And his fucking,  his, as we said before,  his fucking glazed donut thighs,  both of them,  because he'll shift it,  like as it leaks down his left leg  and then he'll heft his cock  into the right side.  Must be a lot of crust on his leg.  Oh, without a doubt.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And his socks began,  it pulled off leg hair.  The socks came off  and he had to get something done.  It does.  It ends up like fucking rubber cement  in your hairs,  in your leg. 
[01:44:00]  It's terrible.  I guess, okay.  That's what they call terrible.  Dr. Steve was tweeting something yesterday  about vasectomies and whatnot.  He says that the sperm,  spermatozoa,  is merely 3% of the entire load.  So you don't have to worry about,  like, smaller loads  after you get a vasectomy.  A lot of guys are worried  about smaller loads.  I was,  but I've heard you do have smaller loads.  3% smaller.  3% smaller.  What's that? 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  How much?  What's the fucking that?  It's not even a fucking teaspoonful.  Yum, yum.  Eat them up.  I guess, uh, DL is, uh...  He's on his way.  Late, huh?  Yes, Ant.  He is late.  All right.  Just,  just checking.  You know who else is late?  Who?  He's not doing this show.  Who?  Rick Ross is coming up here.  He's late, too.  He's boss.  He's boss.  Maybe they're, um...  He's about 20 minutes late. 
[01:45:00]  Maybe they're hanging out.  I want to go meet Rick Ross.  The boss?  Do ya?  Rick, yay!  What are you going to say?  Hi, Rick.  What's your, what's your favorite song?  Yeah.  That fucking, um...  What was that one?  Uh-huh.  Oh.  Yeah.  Right.  I'll say, truthfully, I don't listen to the music, but I like him.  Are you going to go up to him and just go, my nigga?  You should do that. 
[01:45:30]  Shake his hand.  No?  No.  I think you're allowed to do that now.  Mmm.  I think white people are getting more permission to use the A version.  On the websites you go to.  Well, it's not quite the N-I-G-G-A version.  They're progressive.  Right.  They keep it, you know, old school.  Right.  As they say.  Right.  I should just walk up and go, what are you the boss of what company, huh?  You think he'd, uh...  No, he'd probably go, Chipper, you're a nut. 
[01:46:00]  What did he do?  Is he another, like, badass criminal?  No, I think he was a corrections officer.  Yeah, it turns out he used to be a corrections officer who stole the, uh, name of a very famous  drug dealer.  However, he spits hot fire, so it's like, what are you going to say?  What do you mean spits hot fire?  He's very good at rap music.  Oh, he is?  Mm-hmm.  He, uh, performs?  Or does he just, uh...  Of course, yeah.  No, yeah, yeah, he's a rapper.  See, I don't know anything about the rap community.  He's a recording artist.  Yeah?  Yep. 
[01:46:30]  What's with the Godfather font?  He's the fucking boss.  The boss.  That's right.  Now, I assume that's a take on the boss.  That's how he says it, yeah.  I'm the boss.  I interviewed him once when 50 Cent was making fun of him.  Oh, you did.  And I asked him, uh, if it hurt his feelings.  Uh-huh.  When 50 Cent bought his baby mom a coat.  Oh, that's right.  And then he said, no, that's the highest compliment you could give to a boss.  And then he started calling 50 Cent and his management team monkeys. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, boy.  Is that amazing that he fucking didn't get broken by that, though?  Not even close.  I mean, he's a...  Ja Rule's career was ended by 50 Cent shitting on him.  Was it?  Yeah.  Yeah, and Rick Ross has never been more successful.  Amazing.  Do you think that it's, um...  Is he a more respected rapper than 50 Cent?  Rick Ross?  Yeah.  Right now, definitely.  I guess he doesn't want to get in any beef with, uh, Bruce.  Bruce, so that's why he says the bouse, instead of boss.  You think he's worried about Springsteen?  He's very worried about a Bruce beef. 
[01:47:30]  He wants New Jersey to still have love for the bouse.  Exactly.  So he says the bouse.  Right.  And leaves the boss to Bruce.  There are rumors that his beard is stuck on.  What do you mean?  Like fake?  Red Band from Joe Rogan's podcast showed me a video of this thing that I didn't even know  was happening.  And I try to stay up on the community.  Sure.  But in black barbershops, there's this process.  The berbershop?  The berbershop.  The berbershop.  There's this process of you can go in as a man and have a beard stuck to your face. 
[01:48:00]  That's why so many of these beards look so clean.  Come on.  And cut.  I swear to God, there's videos.  That's fucking silly.  There's videos of guys getting these beards put on, and people are saying that Rick Ross'  beard may be stuck on.  So much like when black chicks fight and weaves get left in the street, you mean to  tell me soon we may be seeing errant beards laying in the road due to black guys fighting? 
[01:48:30]  If it comes to fisticuffs, somebody may end up losing a beard.  That'd be funny.  Like, oh shit, he pulled off his beard!  World star!  Right.  Yeah, that does look fake, that beard.  Let me see it.  Look, it's very big.  He's had it forever.  He's got an afro on his chin.  Right.  You could do that in the new GTA.  You could go to the barbershop with the black character.  Oh yeah, huh?  You don't gotta tell me.  Can you open a picture and zoom in on it?  I only have played the black characters in GTA. 
[01:49:00]  Have you changed him at all?  Like the way he looks?  Oh, hells yeah, yo.  Mine has like a small ice cube afro and a big Rick Ross beard.  I went with the 80s kind of fade.  Yeah.  And I don't think I went with facial hair.  But it's just, I gotta give it to the black people.  It is so much fun to go to the rich white neighborhoods in GTA 5 as the black character  and just punch white people in the face as you walk down the street.  Because they don't fuck with you. 
[01:49:30]  If you go to the ghetto area in GTA 5 and punch one of the brothers in the face, he'll pull  a gun out or a knife and start fucking you up.  But the white people in the white neighborhoods, they run in fear and then you just stomp them.  I did the most amazing thing in GTA 5 that I didn't even know was possible over the weekend.  It changed my life.  What'd you do?  You know how if you really want to get the cops on you, you drive onto the tarmac at the airport  and the cops get furious.  Instant fucking at least four stars, right?  Yeah, so what I did was I drove onto the tarmac and there was a private plane driving 
[01:50:00]  on the tarmac getting ready to take off.  Oh shit.  So I drove my car up to it, jumped out of the car and jumped on the wing of the plane.  Come on.  They stopped the plane and the pilot gets out.  I jumped in the plane.  Oh man, you jacked the fucking plane.  And I took off away from the cops.  I took off in the plane.  And then I flew that shit into a bridge.  You're a terrorist, Sam Roberts.  That's D.L. 
[01:50:30]  Yougley.  What's that, man?  What's happening, man?  D.L.  Who does smell good.  Looking sharp per usual.  Per usual.  Opie is out today.  Yeah.  He decided Tuesdays can go fuck themselves.  That's what he says.  He's an out Tuesday.  Oh yeah.  Well, Jimmy, you were accurate.  I said you always smell good.  Smells good.  You're a very good smelly man.  I bought a couple of colognes on D.L.'s recommendation. 
[01:51:00]  Did you?  Absolutely.  Somehow it just doesn't have the same effect, does it?  No, it doesn't.  It's nice knowing that it has potential.  Jimmy, it doesn't matter what you put on.  You stink.  Yeah, I know.  Not at all.  They say it's chemistry.  Is it?  Yeah, yeah.  That's like, you go to, you watch some of those shows on Discovery Channel, whatever,  where they put together a fucking steel-built the radial tires and stuff.  I've watched those dumb shows.  And you see like these fragrance places.  And they, yeah, they literally, it affects the body heat, the chemistry that comes off 
[01:51:30]  for you.  They did a survey.  Interact.  Well, they made men, they played basketball, they ran, then they took a handkerchief and  they wiped their underarms by their pubic hairs and put it in their pocket like a pocket  square.  And the women always liked that more.  Holy shit.  By that standard, women should dig taxi drivers.  Yeah, right.  Well, I don't think swamp ass was on that.  Maybe, maybe a few dabs of, you know, the male musky shit, but those cab drivers. 
[01:52:00]  This smells like I'm running from a rebel tribe.  Sometimes you get in a fucking cab and it's just, and I know we've done this, you know,  people have done this a thousand times, but it's distracting for the entire ride.  You can't do anything but concentrate on the stench that is in that frigging vehicle.  Remember when we had the air of spring, you know, a couple of years ago.  Yes, yes.  I'm like, it ain't nothing like Irish spring.  No, no.  No, I don't think it's as fresh as an Irish spring. 
[01:52:30]  There are certain colognes you want to smell good with.  There's one I wear that I get a lot of compliments on every time I wear it.  That's a mouthwash.  And then there's other ones that I wanted and I just, they smell good.  I like them, but nobody comments on them.  But this one cologne, I just have to, it's much better.  But that's the only ones you wear, you know, you wear when a woman says, what is that?  Yeah, yeah.  Does it make you want to fuck me or is that?  Yeah, yeah.  Because that's what you're going for.  Now I'll just wear it all the time.  Yeah, I should stop trying to fucking one-up myself and just take the one. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  I'm going back and getting obsession and fucking Drakkar Noir in a polo.  I'm trying to recapture my high school glory days.  Drakkar Noir.  What are you, Persian?  Drakkar was big for a while.  It was a huge.  That was a big one.  Lagerfeld.  Yes.  CK1.  Drakkar was so good, it was in those little vending machines in the bathroom.  After a while.  You'd get that fucking...  That's when you know, you're like, ah, this is Kuro, this is going too far.  Fucking high karate.  Now you remind me of my father. 
[01:53:30]  Uh, yeah.  This smells like I'm going to get my ass whipped when I get home.  There was always, I remember as a kid, you walk into the bathroom and your dad's shit  was just fucking all over the sink and just, yeah, brute by a Fabergé and the old razor  and fucking the little cup with the thing to mix up the foam.  What is this, 1850?  Right, here it is.  Some sarsaparilla.  But it was always like a mysterious thing as a kid.  You'd look at those adult friggin' bathroom things and be like, oh man. 
[01:54:00]  I can't wait to get this done.  I gotta shave.  We had, uh, my father, my mother would only wash, like, she only washed all our clothes  together.  And it was one, it was me, my brother, my father.  And all the, she washed everybody's underwear together.  Oh, but yeah.  So, so you had to rush to the basket.  Sometimes he got ours and sometimes we got it.  Oh, shit.  Sometimes they were so big they were hanging out.  Giving no support.  Sometimes.  You just had to go. 
[01:54:30]  You had to rush to the basket because the good ones.  She wouldn't separate.  No, fold.  Yeah, none of that shit.  None of that shit, right?  She would go get you some girls.  You're lucky I washed it, you motherfucker.  Right, right.  And then everybody had jackets.  All of us had jackets.  Like a big family.  All of us walking around in a little circle.  Oh.  Oh, shit.  Jesus Christ.  It was fucking hard.  And then they take the underwear and use them to, like, after they get so old, nobody  can use them.  Then they use them for, like, dust cloths.  A dust cloth. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, yeah.  So you could pledge the fucking furniture.  Oh, shit.  I'd never go back to that shit again.  I don't think.  Do people even do that anymore?  Like, I remember my mom would, like, Saturday morning, she would freak out and be like,  this place looks like a bomb hit it.  And, like, we'd run around looking over our shoulders like fucking urchins.  Fucking Oliver Twist.  And, yeah, dusting was a big part.  You vacuum.  You dust.  You do the dishes.  And, like, you'd sit there and just spray the fucking pledge. 
[01:55:30]  Does anyone do that anymore?  Do kids have to do that?  I think, like, furniture now is self-cleaning or some shit.  Pledge smells good.  No matter what happened in your house, fucking pledge smelled fucking good.  You get a body store at the corner.  If you pledge the table, the fucking place would be fantastic.  And pine saw.  Pine saw.  I think they always made fragrances that made it look like you cleaned some shit that you did.  Right.  You could really do a half-ass job and at least it's like, wow, this place is clean.  What's the one for all wood? 
[01:56:00]  It's not pledge.  There's another one that's for...  Murphy's Oil.  Yeah, but that never does it for me.  I don't like that stuff.  No?  No, I like pledge.  They don't have the...  I don't even...  I can't remember the last time I saw it.  I don't remember what the Mexicans use at my house.  They come through like a fucking brown tornado.  Just clean all that shit up and it smells great.  Oh, like, my, uh...  We had the same lady named Marleni for 20-some years, right?  And she's from Guatemala.  But my wife one day made this big Cinco de Mayo dinner. 
[01:56:30]  Oh.  And she's like, I don't know what the fuck this is.  Oh, shit.  She's Guatemala.  Yeah, yeah.  She assumed.  This is fucking horrible, huh?  I don't know.  Anything south of Texas, probably all eat the same shit anyway.  I don't know.  It was...  Man, I had the worst experience Friday, man.  I'm at a gig.  And, uh...  You know how people come back after the gig and they're talking.  And I was trying to be fucking charming.  And so this girl's like, I'm talking to her.  She's cute. 
[01:57:00]  And I go, uh, what the fuck is wrong with you?  Are you slow?  And she said, I had a stroke.  And I said, oh, my God.  She didn't have no goddamn stroke.  Started with the bullshit.  And her friend said, she really did have a stroke.  And I went, oh, my God.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  That's a bad move right there.  Can I buy you a drink?  I'm so sorry.  And she said, no, it'll mess up my medication.  I was like, oh, fuck this shit.  Oh, on medication, too?  She was young, though.  She had to be 30.  That's a shame.  Did she look good?  She did.  She was cute.  And then it gets worse. 
[01:57:30]  So then after it's over, we're waiting for her car.  Did she forget a wooden leg?  Oh, my God.  So I had to.  She couldn't.  They left her friends, like, leave her to go get the car.  And she's standing up front.  She's on.  So I had to hold her up by her hand and head.  Oh, shit.  Oh.  And just feeling like shit the whole time.  Oh, the whole time.  She can't get past that.  She was so sweet.  And I was like, why didn't I see?  Because I could only see from this side of her face.  Yeah.  Well, you probably wouldn't assume at that age, you know. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  Something.  What made you say, are you slow, just the way she was talking?  Because she was just, like, she was laughing.  But, like, why would you even say that?  Because, like, here's why.  999 times out of 1,000, it's just a girl with a goofy laugh.  And her friends would go, oh.  Oh, he picked the one stroke.  That weren't it.  That time weren't it.  Right.  That wasn't it.  Holy shit.  I pulled a faux pas once.  A guy I worked with, we left work to go for lunch. 
[01:58:30]  And I get in his car in the passenger seat.  And I go to click the seat belt.  And the fucking thing is at the end of the fucking belt.  Like, you can't let out anymore.  Right.  And I was like, who's the fat piece of shit that was sitting here?  And it was his mom.  He goes, oh, my mother.  And I'm like, oh, sorry, man.  He's like, no, it's okay.  You know, she's big.  I'm like, oh, I called his mom a fat piece of shit.  Well, you can have a fat ass mother.  Yeah.  But his girlfriend.  No one wants to hear that your mom's a fat ass. 
[01:59:00]  You could know it.  You could accept it.  You know that your friends know it.  Right.  But you don't want to hear him say your mom's fat.  Like, so, in such, with a lot of venom in it.  I did, too.  Who's a fat motherfucker?  I was like, who's the fat piece of shit?  That's what I said, piece of shit.  And then it's like, what makes you pop shit out like that?  The common one is, you know, when's the baby do?  Right.  I guess Brian Regan does that bit.  It's like, you try to take it back as you're saying it.  When's the baby do?  Just flies out of your mouth.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Somebody said that in here. 
[01:59:30]  Oh, the taco lady.  Remember?  Oh, yeah.  She had, like, a gut on her.  Yeah.  And I wasn't sure if maybe she was, you know, getting high on her own supply.  Or she was pregnant.  I didn't say anything.  And then I guess Opie just turned around, of course.  Mr. Charm.  So, what's the baby do?  And everyone just went, like, winced.  And she said, you know, a few months or whatever.  And we were like, oh, boy.  Oh, Christ.  Yeah, she actually was pregnant.  Well, she's Latin, right?  Well, she's pregnant.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, you assume she's always pregnant. 
[02:00:00]  Baby already had its ears pierced.  What are you, a rabbit?  In utero.  They're doing in utero ear piercings in the Latin community these days.  And tattooing on eyebrows.  Look, I can tell the boy, how come?  Because he's holding a little leaf blower.  I get horrible when I come here.  I thought something terrible.  Because, of course, again, Hispanic gentlemen do my yard work also.  So, yeah, go figure that one out, right?  We used to have Asian dudes. 
[02:00:30]  Asian guys?  Yeah.  I hear they're pretty good.  Yeah, but they're very expensive.  They just nip every tree down to three feet tall.  Like, look, Mr. Miyagi.  I don't want bonsai trees.  It's like, I fucking had a big weeping willow here.  Now it's a little fucking bonsai.  Just trim down the oleander.  I don't need.  Bring you luck.  Yeah, great.  Great.  Yeah, and then he had one of those, the backpack on with the blower.  Yeah.  And he's going around, and I thought, it's like, I couldn't get out of my head to call him Buck Rodriguez.  Yeah.  Looked like a little rocket pack. 
[02:01:00]  Come on, it's funny.  It's hilarious.  You know, I still call him that.  Tell all my friends.  Oh, when he leaves away.  Oh, it's just.  I know.  It's certain shit you just have to do.  I don't.  Like, you know, in California, they had the leaf blower, they banned them because they  were so loud.  Yeah, they're loud, and they're all over.  Right.  Like, every yard.  Yeah.  But they didn't realize that those, that really stops, cuts down the number of gardeners  that you have around.  Uh-huh.  So, like, a few, a leaf blower can take up the space of three people. 
[02:01:30]  So, then they didn't have a leaf blower, so just the place was a lot of Latin.  Yeah, yeah.  Now, what, they've got to pull the rakes out and do it old school?  Yeah.  You have to do it.  Fuck that.  I don't care what modern technology they bring back there.  Get some out of there faster.  There you go.  They banned it legally?  Yeah.  California's weird, man.  Yeah, it is.  It is.  They make up all these wacky laws.  Yeah, you can't have, now, in Calabasas, where I live, you can't have plastic. 
[02:02:00]  What?  You have to bring your own paper bag.  We have to bring your own bag when you go to the store.  Oh, right, to the store?  Fuck that.  You can't smoke outside.  Like, if you smoke in the common areas, you can get a $200 ticket.  So, you're just supposed to smoke at home?  And now they're trying to ban where you can't even smoke at home.  So, yeah, I think if you live in an apartment, they're trying to stop at condos.  There's no condos there.  No, no.  No, and, like, I live in the same neighborhood as Justin Bieber, so.  Oh, okay.  And he's fucked up to the whole neighborhood, because now the police are in. 
[02:02:30]  Right, right, right.  He made the neighborhood.  He blew up the spot, and now it's all hot.  I had a neighbor that got a DUI one house down from his house.  Oh, like, I don't know why he didn't fucking just drive in his driveway and open the garage  and close the garage and run in the house.  I've seen that in cops.  Don't work.  No, but they're always going to follow me, because I...  That's true.  Well, they probably would.  You better hope that garage door comes down like one of those fucking Star Wars doors.  I just ran, and then he talked to his lawyer, and he said, 
[02:03:00]  Why didn't you just go in the house, and then they couldn't find you until you came down?  Yeah, come out fucking eight hours later.  Right, right.  I didn't know you were behind me, officer.  Drinking your coffee.  How you doing, man?  Right, right.  What's up, sir?  If they're in speed, but then they would say they were in pursuit,  and you were evading a police officer.  But they were.  They just, they just, yeah, well, shit.  That is true.  I've seen, like, where they've been pursuing people on cops,  and the guy is near his house, and he pulls in the driveway,  runs out, and runs in his house.  Oh, boy, they follow him right the fuck in there. 
[02:03:30]  Not even a knock.  They're not going to follow an old white man in his house.  Well, that's true.  Yeah.  Not accountable.  They would have done.  Yeah, they'd probably leave him alone.  Okay.  Me?  They would have done.  But that motherfucker.  He looked okay.  Let's go.  He was home already.  Let's go see what DL's up to down the road.  What's the point of giving somebody a DUI when they're pulling in their fucking driveway?  That's true.  He made it.  It's like Ali Ali and Free Free.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I made it.  I'm at base.  Right.  I'm at home base.  Unless you have a patent leather shoe in your grill. 
[02:04:00]  Right.  Then perhaps further investigation is necessary.  Is that blood?  Jimmy is getting a picture and an autograph right now.  He was very excited.  Jimmy will leave the program for these things.  He left.  Who did we have in here?  Tony Danza.  We had Tony Danza.  The incredible Tony Danza was in here.  And Jimmy left.  And who was the boss?  Yeah, yeah.  And the amazing Tony Danza show.  If you remember that talk show he had for a little while.  Is amazing the word?  Yeah.  Well, you don't remember it either.  He had bangs, right? 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  He had sort of a...  Kind of like Christy McNichol in Eight Is Enough, right?  Christy McNichol bangs.  Yeah.  Tony Danza was rocking the bangs for quite a while.  Well, what happened there, Jim?  I just wanted to take a quick photo.  Did you get it?  Yeah.  Oh.  Was he cordial?  You got skinny, man.  Thanks, Theo.  Didn't he?  Yeah, he was very friendly.  How did that...  How much did he lose?  It's funny.  I went to my doctor yesterday.  And I said, what was the heaviest I was?  And she said, right now I'm coming out with clothes on at 153. 
[02:05:00]  Wow.  But she said I was in 2011, I was 176 and 173 last year.  And there was one point I can remember being 180.  You lost 20 pounds a year?  More than 20.  Probably almost between 24 and 27 pounds.  Damn.  I'm just going to the gym and eating better.  Go to the gym and eating better.  I just ate better and I do a lot of...  I have four sessions a week with trainers.  You ain't bullshit.  You're trying to live, huh?  Yeah, but you still can't get rid of this.  This fucking... 
[02:05:30]  This mush under the...  Yeah.  It's impossible.  That's all right.  You still...  You'll be around longer.  Yeah.  You'll be around longer.  That's the...  You got to probably lipo that out.  I don't know if I do or not because it doesn't feel like...  I know my eating is not perfect and I know if I ate better, I should be swimming every  day.  If I swam every day for three months, I'll bet you that there's be a big thing.  Yeah, but then you will...  Go for a swim?  You ate 153 and you're a grown man.  And you're not from, you know, a third world country.  You're doing it on purpose.  So, fuck it.  Just...  You don't want to be that... 
[02:06:00]  No, I just want this gush gone.  I don't care.  Like, when I still wear no shirt, I still look like Jim from a few years ago, but just...  It's like I didn't...  I didn't muscle up.  I just shrunk.  It was almost like somebody took a picture of me.  Now he's...  He wants a little vanity.  A little vanity.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Instead of looking better, I feel like somebody took a fat photo of me and then zoomed away from  it.  That's what I'm saying.  That's what I'm saying.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You look great, Jimmy.  Thank you.  He's doing that.  It makes you look younger, too, when you lose weight.  Yeah.  Thank you. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, my trainer noticed that I was doing some reps and she goes, oh, your chest is coming  in.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  Isn't she a nice-looking trainer?  Extraordinarily sexy.  You got girl trainers.  Extraordinarily.  I get zero vibes.  Zero.  It's like nothing.  Zero.  Just give me the money and do your crunch.  Yeah.  You like the female trainer?  Oh, yeah.  I don't want a male.  I don't want male energy.  No.  I don't want a guy in between reps.  Shut up.  You know what I'm doing?  It's this place called SLT here.  Mm-hmm.  And it's one in Midtown. 
[02:07:00]  You would think Pilates was crazy, but it's the most intense.  Like, it's strength training, Pilates, and cardio all at one.  Oh, man.  It's 15 minutes.  But it's all these young, white, lean, dancer type.  Oh, shit.  And they're doing all this.  I'm like, man, fuck this.  I'll do two crunches and then that's it.  Then, yeah, yeah, and I'm done.  But it's, I'm telling you, it's the best thing I've ever.  Yeah?  I do it four times a week.  Damn.  No, 15 minutes.  That's it.  50.  Oh, 50. 
[02:07:30]  Okay.  But you know how, like, you have to do weights and then you'll have to do cardio.  This is all one thing.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  They're like almost bondage machines.  You've seen them?  They're like BDS.  I've taken a little bit of Pilates, but I preferred the mixing up that a trainer gives  me, but Pilates are really good.  Right.  But it's not, I'm telling you, it's not on that little machine.  It's called a mega reformer and it's just, why are we sitting there?  You can tell we're always talking about fitness now.  I know, right?  It's taking a horrible turn.  You can though.  I saw a picture that Joe Rogan posted yesterday and he's lifting a fucking kettlebell that 
[02:08:00]  was like a cannonball.  Yeah.  Fucking like just, yeah, fucking getting into the, you know, and he uses these fucking  words that makes it sound like it's amazingly fun.  Yeah.  I just retweeted it and put pussy.  Right.  Look how that worked out for Joe Piscopo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm so in shape.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nobody wants a sexy comedian.  No.  Nobody wants.  Rogan pulls off being muscular stuff because he's in a fight game.  Yeah. 
[02:08:30]  And so it works.  Right, right.  UFC thing.  Yup.  But nobody wants a sexy.  No.  That's when comics are in trouble.  When you start wearing leather shirts and wearing them open on stage, you're in deep  trouble.  Oh, you don't think that works?  No.  No.  It does for a while though.  It could be the outcast.  For a while.  Then everybody goes, this guy's a dickhead.  Yeah.  It does for a while.  Yeah.  People are afraid to play the fool or to be the foil or whatever the term would be.  Right.  When they think they're sexy.  Yes.  It's not, you're not, you can't be self-deprecating. 
[02:09:00]  Right.  You can't.  I don't want a comic up there telling me like it is.  Right.  Oh, shut up.  You don't like that?  That's so fucking boring.  What?  What?  So boring.  There's enough good looking guys in real life to do that.  Oh, right.  I don't even got a comic who I know fucking hates his own guts as much as I do.  You want him to be a piece of shit up there?  Yes.  Be yourself.  You're up there tap dancing for, and doing little jokes.  You're the same fucking emotionally desperate idiot I am.  But black guys can get away with it more.  You know, you just can't like, I don't like people who like themselves. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah?  Like I just don't, if you like yourself a lot.  Right.  I don't trust you.  Eddie Murphy would come out though, and Chris Rock and shit.  Yeah, but he was a rock star.  I know.  That's just it.  You know, he could get away with shit like that.  I think black comics, good looking black comics can get away with it a lot more than  white comics can.  Yeah.  At a certain point, it still becomes like, when you start digging yourself a lot on stage,  you can tell.  You can tell.  I don't want to catch Diggs and shit.  Sure.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:10:00]  You know, it's not fun.  Kevin Hart right now, I know, blows a kiss at the mirror and winks before he walks on.  But Kevin's act is that, he makes fun of his family and himself, and he's a short-grown  man.  He's at least, he's self-deprecating in his act, so that's probably why it works.  Uh-huh.  Murphy, as great as he was, I think the first special was better than the second one.  Right.  And the second one when he had the open leather, he was already a movie star.  Right.  The first special after that.  Well, that's true.  Yeah.  With gloves on.  With gloves, yeah. 
[02:10:30]  With fucking gloves.  But I think everybody else sensed that.  Every other black comic sensed that, saw that, and it does a derivative of it.  Uh-huh.  With a leather shirt.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then at the end, you gotta do the, throw the mic on the fucking stage, and you're  off.  He was the coolest motherfucker on stage with those specials.  When I first saw him, we didn't know who he was.  Like, I grew up in L.A., so I didn't know who he was, but I remember, I want to stay,  I want to see that funny nigga on Saturday Night Live.  Who is that?  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:11:00]  Who is that?  And then one time, when Delirious came out.  Yeah.  Then that's the first time I ever put the name with it.  I, I, he was so, like last night I was after dinner, right?  And, uh, uh, Jamie Foxx was there.  Uh-huh.  And when I first, we started, we were working together at the Comedy Act Theater.  And when I first saw him on stage, he could do, like, impersonations, he could sing, he  could, and I, I remember turning to another comic with Joe Torre and I said, how the fuck  is one dude that talented?  Oh, shit.  I hate that shit.  And all I can do is tell jokes, and this motherfucker can do impressions and sing. 
[02:11:30]  What happened to Joe Torre?  He hosted Def Jam for a while after, uh.  He still, he still grinds.  Yeah.  Yeah, I never, I never knew him.  Yeah, he still grinds out there, but it's just, you, when you grow up seeing these cats,  and I think everybody, getting back to, was influenced by Eddie.  Right.  Fuck yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Except by picking up transvestites, we don't want to do that.  Yeah, well, everybody has their employables.  Well, speak for yourself.  I give them rides as well.  You may be selfish with your car, but I'm not.  Give them rides!  Young lady needs a lift in a few bucks. 
[02:12:00]  Here you are, madam.  God bless.  Godspeed.  Is that a dick?  Yeah.  No, you don't even question it.  That's rude.  You know what I mean?  If somebody fucking coughs and they have, like, a little spittle on their mouth, you  don't question it, you just let it be there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's the way it is.  Embarrassing to mention it.  But Pryor never thought he was sexy.  Like, you know, Pryor dressed well and he dressed nicely.  Right.  And we're, you know...  But he never...  It was never a sexy vibe from him.  No.  And he was always...  He always looked afraid.  Always.  Like, he always looked scared.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The whole time.  Wow, yeah.  Did you see the documentary where they showed the footage? 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  And I had not seen that of him not doing well.  Yes.  On the Sunset Strips.  Yes.  What the fuck was that uncomfortable?  My daughter, my 26-year-old daughter called me.  This is...  Because that was on about a year ago, right?  Maybe...  Not even.  I think that was more than six months.  She calls me and goes, crying.  Oh.  Now I understand you.  And I know you did the best you could.  I'm like, what the fuck you mean?  Oh, shit.  You know, I did the best I could.  I'm not...  I didn't, like, snort cocaine off white women in front of you.  What the fuck are you talking about?  She's like...  She's like, I'm not damaging.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, man.  It was a horrible thing. 
[02:13:00]  I was like, what the fuck are you talking about?  That's a great documentary.  Oh, it's amazing.  By the way, it really gives you a good insight on what Richard was about.  What a horrible...  What he was...  It has to be.  You know how you've ever been high and you're like, am I gonna be like this forever?  Like, you're so high, you go, I'm trapped.  I've gone too far.  Oh, shit.  It must have been like that for him all the time.  Like, not the high part, but just being trapped in your own head.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Doing whatever he wanted.  He had much money to buy as much as he wanted.  Like, no one ever told him no. 
[02:13:30]  No.  No, that's...  Boy, that's a problem.  When no one can tell you...  No one tells you...  No one's there to tell you no.  No.  And you have unlimited resources.  And you kind of want people to.  Fuck yourself, huh?  You kind of like want somebody to do something.  Yeah, yeah.  If you want to, but you don't know how to ask for it.  How do you fucking get to the point where you want to burn yourself?  Did you see the...  And I've talked about this on the show before.  Brutal.  Where, like, you know, I idolized Pryor and didn't know him.  But the one video I've seen that was probably the true depiction of what he was like to  be around was that interview he did on the set of Stir Crazy when they were done filming. 
[02:14:00]  And it was just with this guy who was a school teacher.  And they had shot in the morning and I think there was an audio problem.  So they had to reshoot in the afternoon.  So the guy came back and was re-interviewing Pryor on his lunch break.  And as you could tell, it was outside by a trailer and there's a little audience.  You could just tell by the laughs in the way.  Right.  But Pryor apparently had tipped a few back or was high.  Right.  And you could see in that interview, he was a difficult fucking guy.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He was really a hard guy. 
[02:14:30]  Right.  But he was so smart and so...  It was like rapid fire.  Uh-huh.  And he was drunk and obnoxious but funny and charming and then not funny and charming.  Wow.  And the thing about cats like that is that they're so charming.  There's charming spikes so high that when they are fucked up you almost go,  Okay, this...  Uh-huh.  He's built a bit of equity in this that I can...  He can spin a little...  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He can be a little bit of a fucking douche.  Oh, man.  But most comics when you talk to them are fucked up people. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's weird.  They make you feel good about like...  No, I realize I'm fucked up but I like to be around people that are more fucked up than me.  Do you feel good about yourself?  I'm like, alright.  I'm not that fucked up.  No, Jesus.  Yeah, I'm fucked up but look at this motherfucker.  Hey, he's fucked up.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Gene Wilder, I saw a talk at the 92nd street while we went, me and Sam went.  Yeah.  And Pryor came up and he said...  I think he said...  What did they say when you think of Pryor or what do you...  And he said...  Wasted talent. 
[02:15:30]  Wow.  Waste.  Waste.  Like, he loved him.  He said when he was good, he was really good.  And when he was bad...  Wow.  He was bad.  So he could have been better?  Right?  Yeah.  That's even more fucked up.  He could have been...  Jesus.  On movie sets, he probably wasted a lot of time.  You could tell Gene Wilder did not enjoy their time together.  Because Pryor was probably a little bit difficult.  Yeah, but I bet...  Well, Gene Wilder wouldn't be Gene Wilder without Richard Pryor.  Oh, without a doubt.  But I mean, just as a guy...  Like, he doesn't look at Pryor the way we do.  Yeah.  He doesn't look at him like he's God.  He's just like the asshole that was an hour late again. 
[02:16:00]  Right.  Yeah.  The guy who was...  Well, without a doubt, he wouldn't.  But, you know...  Because he was...  He was his Dean Martin to Jerry Luke.  I mean, that was...  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he was...  But Wilder probably knew that, so now he's like, I'm depending on this guy for my career.  Right.  Right now.  And now he can't defend himself.  Yeah.  Like, literally now he can't...  He can't...  Right.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I never...  Whenever I saw Richard Pryor, whoever was with him, I never even paid attention to.  Even when I was a kid, I never knew what it was about him, but I always knew that whatever 
[02:16:30]  he was doing was more important than ever was going on around him.  Right.  Anyone else on the screen.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Did you know him?  Yeah, I met him a bunch of times, but he was never...  He was really always...  Like, you could tell he loved...  Have you ever seen somebody love a thing so much that even the people who do it, they  give a certain amount of...  Even the young cats that do it, they give a certain amount of, you know, alright, let's  see what this cat is all about.  He was like that.  He was like deferential.  Wow.  It was... 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  I've never seen him, because the comedy scene here was much different than L.A.  All our shit was, you could either go to the Comedy Store, which they didn't let niggas  go to, or you could go to the Comedy Act Theater.  And that was really...  And then everybody would finish going to the Comedy Store and they'd come down to the Comedy  Act Theater, and that's how you saw everybody.  Huh.  I've never played the Comedy Store.  Oh, really?  Really?  Never?  Never.  Huh.  Never.  Never let me play.  Right, right.  Like, I remember the first time I ever got booked at a mainstream room was a Cleveland  Improv. 
[02:17:30]  And they said, it was right after Def Jam, because they had that thing where, oh, he's  a Def Jam cop.  Right?  So, we were playing a gig.  They booked me and they said, we won't give him any money, but we'll give him a door  deal.  Jesus.  And so he could have 90% of the door.  90%?  Wow.  And they let me, and they added like shows and they charged, because they charge black  people high ticket prices.  They'll never pay to see this niggas.  Oh, Jesus.  So, I was in the ticket office counting the money going, this is a great deal, man.  This is a great deal. 
[02:18:00]  And he was livid.  So, then they booked me.  But after that, you know, because they didn't think, I remember being in Charlotte and the  guy says, we were playing a gig in Charlotte, Charlie Goodnight years ago.  And he goes, they only, when you're a black comic, during that time you could work Tuesdays  and Wednesdays, because they would have, you know, the weekend for the other guys.  Or you could work a Sunday.  So, my week consisted of Tuesdays and Wednesdays or a Sunday Monday somewhere.  Like I was a fucking airport worker.  But he came out and said, well, you have to, it was in Raleigh, North Carolina. 
[02:18:30]  He said, you have to sign this, that you're not going to talk about any of the white people  in the 90s.  I'm like, fuck, what the fuck is that about?  I said, no, I'm not going to sign it.  I said, no, I'm not going to sign it.  Why?  I don't know.  Why?  Because it was something they had against Defty.  I mean, a lot of it, obviously, you know, was kind of perception.  But he said, I said, I'm not signing it.  He said, well, you're not going on stage.  I said, well, you tell these two shows I got to go home.  And then he did.  Jesus.  Yeah.  You're not going to make fun of the white people in the room?  Yeah, you had to sign it. 
[02:19:00]  Make sure you use the colored bathroom, too.  Right, right.  Wow.  They didn't have that, though.  They didn't have that?  They didn't go that far?  They didn't go that far.  What did he assume?  Like, it was going to be, you're white people crazy.  Right, I guess he did.  Yeah, yeah.  I guess he did.  I said, I'm not doing it.  But it was something he made everybody sign.  Uh-huh.  Where'd they shoot Deft Jim?  Here.  It wasn't for where?  What was it?  It's on the same street as the Paramount Hotel.  It's 40-something, 40?  I don't know.  It's right across from the Paramount Hotel.  Was it 500 seats or 1,000 seats?  It might have been 1,000 seats.  I was there once, because I was there when Voss did it. 
[02:19:30]  Uh-huh.  And my greatest moment is when we interviewed Russell Simmons, and Voss was the first white  guy that did Def Jam, and Russell Simmons had no idea who he was.  Oh, God, that's funny.  I've never been happier to hear and not recognize him.  Yeah, yeah.  Russell was just churning out talent.  Yeah, yeah.  Never met you.  He'd just stand up like the Pope.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know what this is.  I don't know who that is.  Thank you for coming.  God bless.  Good night.  That was it.  That's right.  I forgot about that.  It was the same thing every night.  Yeah, that...  And they would do...  All day they would do the shows.  Really?  All day they would do one, three, five, seven, nine, all day. 
[02:20:00]  Wow.  Different crowds?  Different crowd.  Well, they'd do two shows with the same crowd.  So the crowd would have to be there four hours, but it was...  How many times did you do it?  Five?  Oh, okay.  I was from LA, so they flew me out to New York, and they gave you a hotel room, and they  gave you...  I said...  I had a thing on my hotel bill that said per diem, and it said $150, and I went... 
[02:20:30]  I didn't order per diem.  I actually went and said...  Oh, no.  I did not...  I didn't order the per diem.  I don't order the per diem.  I'm not paying for this shit.  And she said, no, sir, that's a credit, and that's yours.  Oh.  And I went, oh, well, fuck it.  In that case, give me another.  Yeah, yeah.  I had no idea what that shit meant.  I was like, you get it.  You get it.  What does that...  What does it mean?  Per diem.  It's per diem.  Oh, shit. 
[02:21:00]  What are you promoting, Mr. DL?  I'm doing...  Right, I forgot I am here.  I'm doing a game show on TBS that Mark Barnett did.  Right.  I've seen many, many spots for that.  If you watch baseball, you saw me.  They're promoting you.  Or Tyler Perry show.  Or Seinfeld.  Or Seinfeld.  True.  Okay.  Maybe you went another direction.  I wasn't anticipating that.  Totally another direction there.  Yeah, yeah.  So me and Michael Ian Black are co-hosts on the show called Trust Me, I'm a Game Show host. 
[02:21:30]  And it's like an edgy nighttime...  They gotta figure out who's bullshitting, right?  Yeah.  Who's lying.  But, you know, Mark Barnett, who did Survivor, who did The Voice.  The English...  Didn't we beat them in a war?  I know, right?  They...  It's not the Mexicans we gotta worry about taking out of time.  No.  It's the English.  They are uber successful with that shit.  They're giving us back one reality show at a time.  Right?  Yeah.  It's always like, oh, here's my new show.  And this dude, what I'm telling you, when he walked in, he was tanned. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  And smart and bright white teeth.  And he throws his keys on the...  His keys to his Bentley on the car and he runs his hair through his hair.  I'm like, this motherfucker's rich.  Yeah.  That's just rich guy shit.  He's like, no, this is all wrong.  It's all wrong.  It's all wrong.  Like, just...  He walked in.  You could...  I could actually...  It got brighter when this motherfucker walked in.  I was like, oh.  Oh, shit.  And so he had this idea for this show for 10 years.  And it's basically...  He tells a...  Michael Ian Black will say a fact and I'll say a fact. 
[02:22:30]  And you pick the one who you believe.  But it's some really obscure shit.  It's not like, you know, Jeopardy.  Like, you have an example that you can...  Like, he might say, cold weather makes your fingernails grow.  And I might say, Oprah Winfrey and Elvis Presley are distant relatives.  Mm-hmm.  And you pick.  So which one would you think it is?  Well, I would have to go with a fingernail one.  It's not.  Oprah and...  I would go with that.  Because if you trace them back far enough, as a species, we all connect somewhere. 
[02:23:00]  Well, right.  That's probably closer than...  Or they...  We probably, at some point, owned her family.  Maybe.  Oh, God.  At some point.  Yeah, maybe the colonel.  Somebody owns them.  Oh, you think maybe the colonel stuck his dick in somewhere?  Maybe the colonel had a little shit going on there.  It's called Trust Me, I'm a Game Show host.  And it's on tonight, actually, on TBS.  Is it on right before Conan?  Conan's on 11, I think.  It's on 11, I think.  Yeah, so it's gotta be right before.  So it's 10.30, 9.30 Central. 
[02:23:30]  I don't know what time Conan's on Central time, but if you're a Conan fan and you watch,  just tune in a half hour early.  Yeah, he really does some funny shit these days, Conan.  Yeah.  We played something he did yesterday, which was the montage of these awful newscasters all  saying the exact same thing about Mike Myers' baby.  Yeah, yeah.  What happened?  Mike Myers is having a kid, having another baby.  Wow.  And every newscaster started the story by saying, Mike Myers says, yeah, baby.  And it had to be 30. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah.  30 times.  It was terrible.  Madeline's doing some great shit, too.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  There's definitely, it's like the golden age of late night talk right now.  Right.  You know?  Arsenio is the same show.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Well, he appears in an older demo, I think.  And Kimmel and Fallon.  They're not dead, though.  Like that.  Like, I swear, between, I'm not kidding.  Lamar Odom was on Crack, which at Crack, I haven't, like, how do you even find Crack?  Like, is it like an old copy of New Jack City? 
[02:24:30]  I didn't even think it was Crack anymore, right?  So between Crack and the Arsenio show, I'm like, when the fuck did we go back to the  80s?  What happened?  What happened?  Yeah, what happened?  So, I just, these cats are doing, I think, Fallon, Kimmel, Conan, they're doing shit  that is really, like, cutting edge shit.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's all specific.  It's very relevant.  I mean, the way Kimmel uses the internet is amazing. 
[02:25:00]  Social media.  Social media.  Same thing with Fallon, yeah, with using Twitter and getting shit for his show through  Twitter.  And the shit he gets people to do.  Yeah, yeah, yep, yeah.  Yeah.  Really clever.  Good.  It's not only about, you know, having some celebrity come on because they're plugging  something.  I mean, that was pretty much what Carson was all about.  You know?  I mean, it was great.  Believe me.  I love watching Johnny Carson.  Right.  But I think he was that for that generation. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, absolutely.  Absolutely.  But I think the most, everything else seemed like it was kind of an aside to the interviews.  Right.  You know, even though it was very funny.  Right.  I think it went, you know, I guess, par, then Carson.  Uh-huh.  And I think Letterman did some great.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Letterman kind of opened that up.  Right.  And then, for a very long time, nothing.  And it took those cats a long time.  Yeah.  Like, it's been on a long time.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Probably 12.  Oh.  Been that long?  Long, long time.  I was, Fallon's been on like eight, seven, six, eight.  No way.  That one's been on five, six, eight.  Holy shit.  Really?  He's been on a while.  Fuck.  Yeah.  And he's, remember how slow it started?  But now it's just like, you have to watch that shit.  Yeah.  I was watching an old Robert Klein special again.  I own the HBO specials.  Right.  And I was watching his second one, which I actually haven't seen.  It was done in NYU in 1977, and it's fucking really good. 
[02:26:30]  It's brilliant.  1977?  Wow.  He was the first HBO specials, Robert.  Really?  And he's done more than anybody else, too.  I think Carlin has.  Yeah?  I could be wrong about that, but I think...  He did a special where it was...  Oh, maybe he did.  Yeah.  He's done the most.  He, uh, Klein was talking in 77 about guest hosting The Tonight Show again.  He's like, yeah, I'm gonna guest host, and Johnny had done this and that.  And the whole culture, like you realize, those were college-age students.  Right.  A lot of them.  And Carson was their guy. 
[02:27:00]  Right, right.  It was weird to hear Carson referred to.  Klein was like in his thirties at then, but he was like the really hip, smart comic.  Yeah, yeah.  And all these college students loved him.  And you forget that a lot of these older guys, like, yeah, they were fucking very hip dudes  for a long time.  Yeah.  They did cocaine in the break room.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Ha, ha, ha.  Cocaine in the break room.  Like some of the stories.  Uh-huh.  Like, uh, a friend of mine did a documentary on Paul Williams, The Little Writer.  Oh, yeah.  We've had Paul on a couple of times.  It was great.  You know, I was, you know, he just always looked peculiar to me. 
[02:27:30]  Right, of course.  Yeah.  Little midgety guy.  I know you're rich, but you can't write shit in Six Flags.  You can't.  You can't.  You can't.  But anyway, he talked about how he would be hosting these shows and how fucked up everybody  would be.  Uh-huh.  They would have a drink.  They would have drinks.  Yeah.  A little bump before.  Yeah.  There's a famous clip of Carson where, who's Dean Martin and fucking George Goble is out  there and shit.  And they got drinks in their hands. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  And cigarettes.  They're just smoking and drinking on the show.  You can't even fathom.  No.  Uh, something like that.  Even a fictional character can't do that on TV now.  No.  Uh, and back then they were just like, you know, hey.  Oh.  But even the shit they talked about wasn't this.  And so, like, if you take, to me, the greatest sitcom ever was All In The Family.  Oh, yeah.  And one of the five times I ever heard my father laugh.  I've heard my father laugh five times.  Wow.  Four of them were All In The Family.  All In The Family.  Like, he was, he never laughed. 
[02:28:30]  So when we heard him laugh, we were running the house to see what the fuck he was laughing at.  Yeah, yeah.  He was always All In The Family.  And it was always the most, like, I didn't understand, but always the most racist shit  ever.  Oh, yeah.  And he, it cracked him up.  It was the funniest fucking shit.  Ever.  Yeah.  And imagine if you just, okay, imagine not even the fucking sitcom format aside.  Yeah.  If you just read the dialogue.  So if me and you got a script and just read some of the dialogue back and forth.  Right, right.  It would be...  It would be a fucking controversial vibe.  Outrageous. 
[02:29:00]  I'm talking about just not change anything, just read.  Just read it verbatim.  Mm-hmm.  I was watching All In The Family the other day and it was the one where he got the bootleg  watch.  The Onega instead of the Omega.  And he's describing some of the features to Meathead and his daughter and Edith.  And he's like, looky here, you can tell what time it is in China.  He goes, it's seven o'clock in China.  He goes, you know what that means?  Eight hundred million chinks are waking up for breakfast.  It's like, you can't say that. 
[02:29:30]  Right.  But they just, they didn't care.  It's great.  The Sandy episode I watched, probably two days ago, I watched the whole thing.  It's brilliant.  You know what made me laugh the hardest in that was when fucking, when Lionel is standing  there with Mike and Gloria.  Right.  And Archie goes, this is my daughter Gloria and this is her husband Mike.  And he reaches out and he shakes hands with Lionel and he goes, hiya Mike.  Hiya Mike.  And the laugh from the audience at him thinking that Archie's daughter had buried a black guy.  Right, right.  The laugh from them understanding that was immediate. 
[02:30:00]  I was like, God, what a great fucking show.  But it was, but it was, it was, imagine, you could never imagine a show where we all  sat down and watched the same show.  Like blacks, white, brown, old.  No matter what experience you, like we grew up with the exact same shows.  And not necessarily because a lot of people say when they were the only shows on, but they  still had to find a way to capture your attention.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Then you just wouldn't watch that show if it wasn't, you know, fucking universal appeal.  Uh, now everything's so focused with a laser to a certain audience. 
[02:30:30]  Right.  Uh, they know who they're gunning for and that's it.  But yeah, back then.  Uh, and I think it was because it was so limited.  The, uh, the options were so limited.  You kind of had to make it a, you don't think so?  I think that how the fuck you grew up where you grew up.  I grew up in LA in the fucking 135th in Vermont.  But we laughed at, we can, I can remember.  So they might, true enough, there might not have been many options, but they couldn't  force us to laugh at the same show.  Right.  That's true.  Yeah. 
[02:31:00]  They couldn't make us laugh at the same show.  It had to be in the writing.  It had to be in the sweet spot.  And the, uh, yeah.  And now nothing like, I, I, you know, I, I, we, we do a syndicated show now where we're  talking about, uh, the, uh, preachers of LA.  Mm-hmm.  Like, and in the black community, the church is the biggest thing ever.  Right.  Like, but, but only like three people go to churches, is, is black women, the children  that we have, we may go with them and the gay dudes over in the choir.  That's really, like, cause men tend to just not to go, not cause you're apathetic, but 
[02:31:30]  just cause you're tired of a motherfucker hustling.  Uh huh.  And so I'm watching this shit on, uh, like I have to watch the show cause I want to be  able to talk about it.  Uh huh.  Yeah.  But it's just now when God needs a reality show from these fucking worthless ass dudes  who are just, I, it's just gone too fucking far.  Uh huh.  You don't need a reality.  It's, it's, it was a preacher that got shot in fucking Baton Rouge cause he was fucking  another man's wife.  Oh jeez.  At a revival. 
[02:32:00]  Get that?  He got killed in public.  And you know, every time you turn around, a preacher was giving HIV to kids, you know.  I saw that one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You don't need a reality show.  You need a reality check.  Are you fucking crazy?  It's just, and so, and that's the thing people watch.  Right.  Yeah.  That's what they, they, they, you know, they'll put a bunch of those shows on.  I dig Tyler Perry.  I think he's talented, but if you put Tyler Perry and open and Amos and Andy and you ran  them together, you couldn't tell the difference, but one is vilified and one is glorified. 
[02:32:30]  Right.  Right.  Yes.  It's perception.  It's not.  Cause it is, you know, just the, the, the buffoonery.  It is.  And, uh, okay.  Now one group, like Amos and Andy did it because that was all they were allowed to do  at that particular.  That was the only way that society would accept it.  So they said, we'll play along with it just to get somewhere, just to get somewhere.  And they were incredibly, incredibly accomplished guys.  Right.  And then a group said, Oh no, you're making us look bad.  Don't do that anymore.  Now that same group says, so you're doing a great job. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  And here's this.  Brilliant.  Wow.  Thank you.  Yeah.  It's so, but it's, it's really people's really dumb and down.  That's the thing.  They've dumbed down everything.  Everything.  And I think that does divide up the audience.  That's for sure.  It is.  I mean, I don't think a lot of brothers are watching, um, uh, Big Bang Theory.  I've, I've never watched one episode of Seinfeld.  Yeah.  Oh, Seinfeld.  Yeah.  Yeah.  One.  Not, never once.  Sure. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  Not on purpose.  Never, never went, never said, I'm going to deliberately ignore this.  Right.  It just, it just never happened.  Is that a popular show in Compton?  Well, you know what?  On the show, Steve, Steve, uh, Steve, uh, what is the, what was my fucking, no, Steve,  my fucking co-host.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Steve Wilson.  Uh, yeah.  He was talking about, he made a reference to Emo Phillips and I'm like, I don't even know  what the fuck that is.  Oh.  Oh.  I have no.  Right. 
[02:34:00]  Like, I didn't even know, like I remember once we were doing Studio 60 and they were talking  about Stairway to Heaven.  I talk about, and I, I'll say, oh, the OJ song.  They're like, no, that's the fucking Led Zeppelin song.  Led Zeppelin song.  Yes.  You don't know Emo Phillips?  I mean, I knew Emo Phillips.  He's the cool bubble ice of the white community.  Jesus.  He's the hamburger.  Yes.  Oof.  I never got it, quite frankly.  Yeah.  But I never had heard Stairway to Heaven.  Never.  Wow.  And I'm talking about 2006.  Everyone has heard Stairway by that. 
[02:34:30]  Did you like it?  I did.  Yeah.  I did like it.  But I didn't, it was just.  It must be amazing to listen to Stairway and it's not an old played song.  Right.  This is some good new shit.  And I never, but there are things, and I read a lot.  I travel a lot.  It's just, in 2006, I hadn't heard.  Probably one of the greatest, you know, most.  Right, right.  You know, albums.  Yeah.  Of, of, of, in history.  And I, I didn't fucking hear it.  40 years later.  Right.  This is great.  Have you heard this new shit?  This is great stuff. 
[02:35:00]  By this new group called Led Zeppelin.  Fuck, Led Zeppelin.  Right.  I hope they tore.  Oh, you gotta take a leak?  Alright, we'll take a little break.  Um, I know we have a, well, DL's in studio right now.  Promoting.  Yeah.  Let me give you a proper plug for DL.  It's called, it's a new show he's doing with Michael Ian Black, who's also very, very funny.  It's called Trust Me, I'm a Game Show Host.  And the premiere is tonight.  Uh, it's October 22nd.  It's 1030, it's on TBS.  So, whatever your local, you know, find TBS, it's everywhere.  Yeah. 
[02:35:30]  And it's right before Conan.  So, you know, that's a good time.  DL's on Twitter.  Real DL Hughley, one word, and there's an, it's H-U-G-H-L-E-Y on Twitter.  Mm-hmm.  And you can get all the DL's dates and, uh, all that stuff.  Yeah.  So, uh, good luck.  It's half of you now.  What?  It's only half of you here now.  Yeah.  Half of Jim.  Half of Jim.  That's my good nature.  Yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck.  That's the new good nature of Jim.  You know, all the bad stuff.  All the negativity.  The Jim low cholesterol.  Yeah.  Gluten free. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Jim's 45 and trying to get a TV DL says about being fun and good for all now.  You know.  Is that the fucking truth?  Ah.  Is that the truth?  Yeah.  I, uh, I guess John Lithgow checked in downstairs.  So, John Lithgow's coming in next.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, you wanna hang out.  Fucking, you know, slide over one seat like the old Carson show.  This is 40.  He was fucking hysterical.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He apparently has a kid's book.  Children's book.  I don't know.  Hmm.  Interesting.  We'll talk to him about that.  How about this? 
[02:36:30]  Don't touch that dial.  Ah, it's a good one, Jim.  The Opinetry Show.  On Sirius X.  Sirius X.  This is the Opinetry Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Yeah.  Bring in Mr. Lithgow.  John Lithgow is coming in.  Yes.  This is a treat, Mr. Lithgow.  I'm here every day.  Oh.  Please take a seat. 
[02:37:00]  We are on the air.  Already?  Yes.  As we speak.  How are you?  We like doing that.  How are you?  When you're off the air, before you come on the air, when people sit down and you don't  know anybody and you're kind of, oh, how's the weather?  It's pretty cold out.  We could get right to the show this way.  That's fine.  I like it.  Just hurl me into the deep end.  Yes.  I'm here.  What a treat having you.  I mean, over the years, a huge fan.  What a great resume you have in film, television, stage. 
[02:37:30]  Yes.  Yes.  And now books.  And books now.  I see this nice, cute little children's book, apparently.  I don't know what the title means.  I hope you elaborate.  Never play music right next to the zoo.  Yes.  The book is, it's actually the narration for a musical suite that I and a composer named  Bill Elliott cooked up a few years ago.  It's just a simple children's story about a little boy who goes to a concert with his 
[02:38:00]  parents at a band show right next to the zoo.  It's the performance piece, and there's a CD of it with the book.  The chorus is sort of verse chorus.  It's spoken and sung.  And the chorus is, oh, children, remember whatever you may do.  Never play music right next to the zoo.  They'll burst from their cages, each beast and each bird, desperate to play all the music 
[02:38:30]  they've heard, etc.  That sounds dangerous.  Well, animals crash out of their cages and take over the orchestra.  Oh.  And when I play, perform it with an orchestra, you have to instruct the instruments, the musicians  to play their instruments worse and worse as it goes on.  Oh, because obviously the animals.  They attempt to play.  They try.  The animals are terrible musicians.  That's true.  I see on the cover right here one of the elephants is trying to grab the bow from the cellist.  From the cellist. 
[02:39:00]  That's right.  I would love to read it to children over the radio, but it doesn't have the same impact.  Oh, that would be...  He's actually looking at the pictures and...  Yeah.  Right.  Yes.  Well, you could do it like Fiorello LaGuardia read the funny papers.  That's right.  You could describe the pictures.  But it's...  Lisa Hernandez illustrated it.  It's just a wonderful book and...  Wow.  And I...  It's...  It's especially wonderful when I perform it with the orchestra.  But you don't need a full orchestra at bedtime. 
[02:39:30]  What inspired you to do a children's book?  Well, this is actually my ninth.  I've been doing...  Oh, my goodness.  I've been doing them from...  I'm out of the loop.  Here.  Look at the back.  Well, I told you that before the show.  Jimmy, no you didn't.  Those are all the others.  Oh, my God.  You are.  Wow.  So this is my shadow career, you see.  Geez.  I've been flying under the radar for years.  The only people who know about it are little children and parents.  That must be it, because I am childless.  Yeah.  My womb is barren.  I have no children.  And, you know, as of age eight or nine, children have outgrown me. 
[02:40:00]  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  So why kids books?  Have you written another book, or is it all children's stuff?  Well, I wrote a memoir a couple of years ago.  But, basically, I've only had the courage to write children's books.  You know, children are far less critical of your literary technique.  Well, that's true.  I can't imagine many hater tweets from little kids.  Yeah.  If they don't like it, they just kind of throw it on the floor.  Yeah, yeah.  They don't have to hear about it. 
[02:40:30]  Well, all my books grew out of concerts for kids, because I've always done that, ever  since my own kids were small.  And my oldest is 41 years old.  Wow.  So I'm doing it all these years.  And of my nine books, like three-fourths of them are things that I actually perform  in concert, the lyrics to songs, or the narration to a child's guide to the orchestra suites.  I even wrote the narration for a ballet, for the New York City Ballet of Carnival of the 
[02:41:00]  Animals, the Saint-Saëns piece.  You are multifaceted.  Well, is this before you acted, or were you acted before music?  I beg your pardon?  You play music.  I play mediocre guitar, but I learned guitar just to play for kids.  And I don't do it as often as I would like to, but concerts for children are completely  fantastic.  I mean, they're an amazing audience, mainly because they're such a difficult audience.  But if you can keep their attention, we're all after the suspension of disbelief. 
[02:41:30]  And you never quite achieve that with grown-ups.  They know you're pretending.  But kids, you can sucker them into almost anything.  Have you had any bad shows with children?  Children, have you...  Early on, I mean, it's a particular skill that you learn never to let them near your shoelaces,  for example.  All right.  Because they're sure to untie your shoelaces, and that becomes the big event. 
[02:42:00]  They ignore you.  No, but I mean, I've done kids' concerts at Carnegie Hall for 2,500 kids.  And at a certain point, you learn how to manage them.  Right, right, right.  And it's incredibly fun.  So anyway, as I say, like you, I mean, most people don't know I do this, but...  Yeah, exactly.  You know, obviously, your acting career is at the forefront.  That's what everybody knows.  That's my day job.  You're from. 
[02:42:30]  Your day job.  We realize we've been saying your name wrong for 25 years.  Well, the world seems to have.  Yes, I gave up correcting people a long time ago.  Yeah.  Well, they've said Lithgow forever, and it's Lithgo.  It's...  Well, I pronounce it Lithgo.  Apparently, I'm the only one.  Yeah, yeah.  I understand that Rachel Maddow has the same problem.  Oh, Maddow.  Maddow.  Everybody calls her Rachel Maddow.  Well, amongst other things.  Yes, exactly.  I have a new kinship with her.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:43:00]  Are you kidding, or is that really her name?  Rachel Maddow.  That's nice.  She pronounces it Maddow.  Maddow.  I heard her correct the world on television.  Commiserate.  And it's exactly what I go through, but it doesn't bother me.  As long as they're pronouncing it, let them mispronounce it.  Yes.  As long as they're reading it on a credit of a hit movie, as they say.  Do you like playing a...  Do you think it's more fun to play like a shitty person than a good person?  Well, it's nice to surprise people.  You know, that was the great thing about playing the Trinity Killer on Dexter, is to play him 
[02:43:30]  as a nice man with a secret.  And to be known as kind of a sort of loopy, ineffectual fool like Dick Solomon, and then play the Trinity Killer, you just have the opportunity to completely shock people.  Yeah, yeah.  It was a pretty dastardly character.  Yeah.  But great fun.  You're right.  It is fun.  Yeah, it seems like...  Who wants to play a nice guy when you can play a psychopath?  It just seems like...  You play a really great villain. 
[02:44:00]  I mean, and that's kind of what I would associate you with.  Yeah.  If you're going to be in Othello, you want to play Iago.  Now, the dummies in this room will all act like we know who those characters are.  Yes, yes.  But we really are all high school dropout fools.  Yes, indeed.  I have no idea.  We just know Othello is very popular.  Well, Iago is the great role.  Why?  What did Iago do in Othello?  Iago is the villain.  He is the arch villain.  He's the one who destroys Iago.  Of course, Jim. 
[02:44:30]  Othello.  Please.  Yeah.  But he has this incredible connection with the audience.  A connection with the audience.  He tells everybody what he's doing.  What he's doing.  Yeah.  Just listen to your partner.  He's right.  And he thinks that Othello is a board game.  It is.  Remember that one?  Yes.  Well, it's that too.  Yes.  You do good Shakespeare.  Shakespeare seems impossible.  Well, it's not easy.  I grew up.  My father was a theater producer who created Shakespeare festivals.  I grew up. 
[02:45:00]  I was in like 20 Shakespeare plays before I was 20 years old.  Wow.  So it's a kind of language that I grew up with.  But it's a challenge.  Uh, and it's at the, it's, it's at the very heart of British theater.  And, uh, I mean, Shakespeare is certainly popular in American theater too, but it's the very spine of a British actor's training.  Uh, and it really is.  You do have to learn how to perform it. 
[02:45:30]  You know what I've seen when I watch guys doing it?  It, it just seems like the, the, the British actors that I've seen doing it seem too proper.  And it doesn't seem like there's, it means anything.  And I started, you know, I've talked about Brando doing it.  I watched him do it.  And I was like, that's a guy who really seems to understand what it is he's saying.  Absolutely.  I mean, there's, there have been brilliant, uh, American productions of Shakespeare this past summer in Central Park.  I saw this production of comedy of errors of all things set in upstate New York in the 1930s. 
[02:46:00]  Uh, and the characters were all re-imagined as, uh, the mafia up in, so, so the Duke of, and they even used all the, uh, the, the sort of classic Greco Roman place names in upstate New York, like Troy, New York and Ithaca, New York and Rome, New York.  And it was played like the Sopranos and it was hilariously funny. 
[02:46:30]  And, and, and this, the, the, the music, the, the music of the language was completely different.  It was very American.  Uh, it's, it's amazing how that could be translated like that.  Shakespeare is, Shakespeare's flexible.  You can, yeah, put it in a whole different setting and keep the storyline and it actually works.  Yeah, they, they did much ado about nothing years ago in the park set in Teddy Roosevelt's sort of middle Midwestern America.  Hmm.  With, uh, soldiers coming home from the Spanish American war. 
[02:47:00]  Uh, and again, it was just, you just heard it in a completely different way.  Basically, Shakespeare is a great storyteller and, and, uh, you have to get beyond the fact that you're really learning a new language.  Hmm.  It's like 450 year old language.  Yeah.  You have to, you can't just repeat what you read and memorize the words.  You have to know what they mean in order to convey it, uh, properly.  I would imagine, uh, you know, there's a word it out. 
[02:47:30]  Actually, there's a wonderful new book written by the playwright Ken Ludwig, which is called how to teach your children Shakespeare.  And it's, what is that to punish them?  It's no, it's actually, he asked, he asked me to, to write the introduction, which I did.  It's a wonderful book and it's a book, uh, adults can enjoy it so much too.  Cause it just gets at just the fun of Shakespeare.  Hmm.  The fun of learning it and knowing it.  How many awards have you won?  Oh, well, a lot, but I'll tell you one thing I've been, I've won a lot more nominations than actual awards. 
[02:48:00]  Uh, what, and then this might be a hard question, but like I'm always, when somebody wins something and they're up against competition, that's very impressive.  Is there one person that you've beaten that you were the most impressed that you beat because they're which we, which would be, which is kind of a sign of respect for them.  Like, I can't believe I beat this person.  Well, it's always a, it's always a great gang of actors.  Hmm.  Uh, uh, let's see who were the Rob Schneider, you know, I, I tend to forget them as soon as it's done. 
[02:48:30]  That's somebody who's truly won a lot of awards.  Yeah.  That's right.  I won a comedy competition in 1993.  I won a trophy for black history month.  Wow.  I did.  It was like, it was only four of us as comedians and I was terrible, but I was less terrible.  Uh huh.  And I still have that trophy.  And you remember who you beat?  I, I do.  Yeah.  I mean, we're all suckers for awards. 
[02:49:00]  It's a, it's a, it's a nice thing when it happens and, and it's far too important when  you don't lose, you get into a terrible funk.  Really?  Suck about it.  Until you get over it.  Huh?  You mean when you don't win?  Yeah.  Oh, you said you don't lose.  Oh yeah.  Uh, what, what do you, you seem like you're busy all the time.  You're working.  Do you, do you get a chance to relax?  And what do you, what do you like to do when you're just doing nothing?  Well, uh, I'm a huge sports fan.  I can sit hours and hours.  I can't wait for this world series.  Oh, okay. 
[02:49:30]  Uh, and I, I, I have a, a sort of discarded ambition.  I, I wanted to be a painter when I was young and I, I'm actually still a sort of hobbyist  as a painter.  Yeah.  Set the old easel up and, uh, take a stab at it.  I even have a, had had a studio in, in, in California, but until they tore the building  down.  What do you paint?  Uh, I paint figuratively portraits and, uh, I work in oils and I work, but I mean, uh, 
[02:50:00]  I, I, I sort of live out the fantasy of having become an artist.  Hmm.  I'm not an artist.  I don't even, I don't even pretend I am.  I have too much respect for great artists to put me in their company.  Uh, but it's, it is an amazing activity to just sort of lose yourself in a painting and  four hours can go by and you're just, uh, you, you don't remember a single conscious thought  you had.  I've just been completely immersed in that. 
[02:50:30]  I tell you that my favorite thing is something that demands great concentration, but no thought.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  That's to me.  That's great.  Relaxation.  Now, um, Harry and the Hendersons.  Oh, we all wanted to talk about that.  Absolutely.  Um, why no more of them?  Why no more of them?  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  It's, uh, you know, it was not actually that successful a film when it was released.  Uh, amazingly.  You'd be amazed cause I mean, I wish I had a nickel for every, every adult who said they 
[02:51:00]  grew up on it.  Right.  Yeah.  Uh, but it was, you know, you have to be a big success to get a, uh, sequel because  it all happens within, it has to happen almost immediately putting another one into motion.  Right.  It was, they did make a, a sitcom out of it.  Yeah.  But it was a Saturday morning.  Uh, I don't, most people don't even know what ever happened.  Right.  Right.  Yeah. 
[02:51:30]  And I was not in that.  No, no.  You were in a very successful sitcom.  You're a third rock.  Oh yes.  Uh, yes.  Yes.  He's got to remember that.  It's like, yeah, it was a hugely successful, uh, uh, multi year.  Yes.  Although these days everybody tells me how much they love me on 30 rock.  Oh, that's different.  It's a semantic thing.  Do you correct them or just kind of just.  I just thank them.  I also thank them.  And they tell me how much they liked me on Monty Python. 
[02:52:00]  Oh no.  Do you get mistaken for John Cleese?  Yes.  Wow.  Even called John Cleese.  Who's a, and he's a friend of mine.  I've, I've never actually asked him whether anyone mistakes him for John Lithgow.  Well, probably John Lithgow.  Yes, exactly.  That's the thing.  Do you sell your paintings?  No.  No.  So a lot of celebrities paint and then sell them.  That's what you should do.  John Wayne Gacy?  Well, yeah.  I know.  I know.  Oh God.  It's terrible.  No. 
[02:52:30]  Um, I know Pierce Brosnan paints and sells his paintings, but he, he sells it all for charity.  Oh, okay.  Uh, but no, I don't, I don't paint enough to.  I, I hate to let them go.  Mmm.  I give them away.  I give them away, but I don't sell them.  Can you paint hands?  I could never draw hands.  I really suck at hands.  Hands are a challenge.  They will drive everybody crazy.  Yeah.  Jim's life in all arts would be so much better if hands didn't exist.  He always says his problem in acting is that he doesn't know what to do with his hands.  Yeah.  I never know what to do with my hands in a scene. 
[02:53:00]  Like I, I don't know where to put them to be natural.  It just seems awkward to leave him hanging.  That's right.  Or put him somewhere.  Pay attention to my acting.  You'll see that I'm always messing with props.  Do you always have something in your hand?  Next time you watch a movie, you'll see.  Wow.  Inevitably, I'm doing something.  But I always give myself something unimportant.  Like a little business.  Like I'm in a love scene.  I'm holding a bedpan and I'm just giving it back.  Exactly.  But you have to give yourself, I guess, something to do.  But it's so awkward.  Like we're talking right now, my hands are on my lap.  Yeah.  And they're not moving and it's comfortable.  Naturally. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  But if we were in a scene right now.  You would think something was wrong.  I'd get those bowling balls in my hands.  I would feel awful sitting like this.  Well, acting is a funny thing.  You can be so, even me, and I've done a lot of acting in my life.  You're capable of feeling incredibly self-conscious and uncomfortable until it feels right.  And you somehow, over time, you just figure out how to keep working at something until it feels right.  Everyone is an amazing actor when they're not acting.  Yeah. 
[02:54:00]  It's the simplest thing to carry on a natural conversation with somebody and look authentic  because it is, but then trying to recreate it, which seems bizarre that you need to be  very talented to recreate something you just do every second of your life.  Yeah.  It's very interesting.  And ask any actor.  They always feel that they act better off camera for somebody else.  They'll do their close-up, then switch around to allow someone else to do his close-up. 
[02:54:30]  And that's the take.  Off camera, you suddenly feel so real and so relaxed and so witty.  It's just, and you think, damn, the camera's not on me.  Can you use the back of my head on this one?  Yeah, it's brilliant.  Yeah.  Yeah, wow.  I never know.  The hard part is there's a part of me that just goes, you're faking it.  And you're not supposed to think that while you're acting.  You're faking this.  You know who's an amazing director in exactly this area is Judd Apatow. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, wow.  I worked with him on This Is 40 last year.  Right.  For the first time.  And he just sets up the cameras and lets them roll for 15 minutes, and you just do  the scene again and again with him throwing new lines, new ideas.  You're fully expected at a certain point to start improvising.  Hmm.  And he works with a bunch of actors who work with him all the time.  Right.  And are very familiar and easy with this technique.  And he gets the most spontaneous. 
[02:55:30]  That's why his movies, his comedies have such freshness.  That seems to be an amazing technique because you would kind of fall into a rhythm doing  it enough times without having that, all right, do it again kind of a thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  In fact, he'll say, now just go and do it again and just try something completely different.  And this without ever saying cut.  You know, he'll get 15 minutes of material. 
[02:56:00]  What a lazy director.  Exactly.  He's in the truck.  He's eating.  Yes.  He slouches all the way to the bank.  Now, you've directed, right?  I actually started out as a theater director.  Oh, okay.  But only because I couldn't get any acting work.  As soon as I got moving as an actor, I sort of left directing behind.  Yeah.  Did you direct any episodes of Third Rock?  No.  Oh, you didn't?  Because usually after a while.  No, we had this wonderful director, Terry Hughes.  Third Rock was just terrific. 
[02:56:30]  It's almost the factory system.  Everybody knew his role and I was just not interested in taking the helm.  I was having too much fun acting.  Yeah.  I always found that weird because acting and directing aren't really that similar.  No.  But a lot of actors want to go into directing.  There was a period when I was both acting and directing in theater. 
[02:57:00]  And I found it very, very hard to cross back and forth and cross the line.  Yeah.  It's just a completely different relationship with your colleagues for one thing.  And you can't monitor yourself.  I feel I always need someone to tell me, even if I don't buy what they're saying,  I want somebody else to be monitoring what I do.  Right, right.  You'd be the boss.  Yeah.  How was Shatner to work with on Third Rock? 
[02:57:30]  Oh, Bill is great.  I mean, when he did The Big Giant Head on Third Rock.  Yeah, yeah.  As far as I know, it was his first flat out piece of comedy.  And look at what's happened with him since.  Yeah, yeah.  He just, he so enjoyed that.  Yeah.  And it was like red meat to a tiger.  He just, it was like a great relief to him to be, to make a fool of him.  He has a lot of fun.  Yeah.  Have you interviewed him?  Oh, yeah.  We've had him on a lot. 
[02:58:00]  He was just here last week.  Yeah.  He's one of those guys that just works relentlessly.  Yeah.  And he so enjoys it.  Yeah.  He loves it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We had, we had him on.  I like to torture him with nothing but Star Trek references.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And actually the, the, the common, common bond you two have is the, the Twilight Zone episode.  Yeah.  The Twilight Zone episode.  Yeah.  With Nightmare at, I guess it was 30, 30,000 feet. 
[02:58:30]  And his was 20,000 feet.  Yeah.  We, as a matter of fact, when he was on Third Rock, his first entrance was, we met him as  he got off a plane.  Oh, right.  And he said, oh my God.  It was horrible.  Yeah.  He said, this is a man on the wing of that plane.  And my line was, the same thing happened to me.  You know.  That's brilliant.  Yeah.  We could do anything on Third Rock.  Oh, that's funny.  When did we ask him about that?  There was something we asked him about.  Oh, you asked him about the guy in the suit.  And he said he was a small Czechoslovakian fellow. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, right.  I asked him to talk to him at craft services.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All he wanted to know was who was the guy in the dumb furry suit.  Yeah.  In our case, it was a very good actor named Larry Seder.  It was so nice to be able to give him a shout out after all these years.  Right?  Yep.  That was a scary costume.  He was brilliant.  That was a good one.  Not like the little furry suit from the episode.  Yeah.  Did you borrow anything from Shatner in that?  No, I didn't see the episode.  Oh, wow. 
[02:59:30]  At that point, you hadn't seen it?  Until years later.  I finally just saw it by chance on a Twilight Zone marathon.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow, that's amazing.  I would assume.  No, I'd never seen it.  It never registered when I was a kid, even though I remember seeing lots of Twilight Zone.  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  So how did you take it when we were discussing what that was supposed to mean?  Well, how did you take it that what that was trying to say?  We sort of, George Miller directed that episode, and we actually made a conscious choice to make it a film about fear of flying. 
[03:00:00]  Just pure terror.  Mm-hmm.  And of course, the wonderful twist at the end when it actually happened is what turned it into a Twilight Zone episode.  But as a matter of fact, I talked to a great old friend of mine, whom I knew had terrible, terrible fear of flying, just to ask him specifics.  And I was amazed at the things he told me.  Yeah.  He was very open about it. 
[03:00:30]  Just to give you one example, he said, when he's on an airplane and he walks down the aisle when it's in flight, he's terrified of putting too much weight on one side or the other for fear he's going to upend the plane.  Is he fat?  And he knows it's completely irrational, but it doesn't.  And if you watch that film, you'll see just the way I used that was walking down that aisle as if I was on a tightrope.  Yeah, yeah.  Absolutely terrified that the plane was going to tip over. 
[03:01:00]  And this was one of 20 extraordinary things he told me that were so easy to use.  Has he ever gotten over his fear of flying?  Because that fear of flying is a bitch.  I think he must still have it.  It's so restrictive to people, yeah.  But he said when the phone rings in his house, he immediately panics because he's afraid it's his agent telling him he has a job that will require him to fly.  Wow.  That's a fear of flying.  Now that, but I mean, you notice how insane my performance was?  Oh, yes. 
[03:01:30]  Well, it's, I used it all.  Tell your friend you should hire my manager.  That call will never come.  He'll never have to.  The sound in that, too.  The lightning in the window.  Yeah.  And then the...  The engines changing their tone.  Yeah.  It was lightning.  That's George.  That whole thing was amazing.  George Miller.  He did that one just after he'd done the Mad Max movies.  I mean, that...  Oh, right.  High-octane film making.  Oh, sure, sure.  And it was all, you know, it was no, nothing CGI about it. 
[03:02:00]  No, no.  We had a real wing of a plane on hydraulics.  We had like five gigantic wind machines blowing smoke and he under-cranked it so that everything was sped up.  A little faster, yeah.  Including the movements of the little gremlin.  Yeah, yeah.  The gremlin was on wires so he could hop up and down.  Amazing.  I asked William Shatner about...  I said, why didn't he just tell his damn wife, sit by this window. 
[03:02:30]  Yes.  Look out.  If you want to help me.  I know this is very...  Right.  It's going to be a terrible flight for you.  But just look out the window the entire time.  Yes.  Never look away.  And either she's going to see it or everything will be fine.  Yeah.  Well, we deleted the wife, you'll recall.  Yes, yes, you did.  Just so you wouldn't be asking that question.  Right, right.  Then again, the gremlin would have just switched wings.  I know.  That's true.  Something would have happened.  Some guy on the other side of the plane would have had a horrible experience.  But you know, now, never play music right next to the zoo.  Ah, that's true. 
[03:03:00]  Yes.  Yes, that's what we're hearing about.  Back to the book.  By the way.  No, no.  But it also...  I can actually make you a segue.  Nice.  It's about a little boy who falls asleep and dreams all this.  So it's a dream-like kind of exciting and terrifying dream for children that has a happy ending.  Oh, wow.  And there are signings, too, I want to promote because these are always good for a book.  You can go down and meet John and get your book signed tomorrow at bookends in East Ridgewood. 
[03:03:30]  I'm in Ridgewood, New Jersey on East Ridgewood Avenue.  That's a great independent bookstore in New Jersey at 430.  So get there early.  There will be a line, but you can line up inside.  It's a really huge bookstore where they do the signings in the basement.  So it's great.  You're not going to be stuck outside.  And the 25th, which is, I think, Friday?  Friday, yes.  The 7 o'clock, the book review.  It's in Huntington, New York, on New York Avenue, which is not too far from FH Rileys, I don't think, right?  I used to live right around there.  Yeah.  On Long Island. 
[03:04:00]  Very nice.  I expect you guys to be there.  Absolutely.  I'll be there, Mr. Lithgow.  And I think I'm even going to perform it.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  I'm doing this sort of karaoke version.  Bill Elliott sent me the entire score without the voice.  Oh, wow.  So I'm going to put it into a boombox and perform it for the kids.  Because the whole fun of it is hearing an orchestra's play badly.  Yeah.  Well, this is great.  Congratulations.  What a treat.  Thanks so much for coming in. 
[03:04:30]  Oh, it's great.  And continued success with your children's books that I didn't even have a clue.  I feel like such an ass.  But you're not a child.  You only behave like one.  Well, I've been told differently, yes.  But, wow, yeah, you've got quite the collection here.  Yeah.  And they're wonderful books, too.  They're Simon & Schuster books that I started writing them in, like, 1999.  And I produced them.  Make a good Christmas gift?  Of course.  That's why I'm here.  Exactly.  Why do you think I'm here? 
[03:05:00]  Of course.  Very good.  John Lithgow, right?  No, Lithgow.  Lithgow.  I had a chance to just say, hey, you don't understand how you changed my life after  The World According to Garp.  As long as it was just your life.  The direction my life went into it.  After that movie.  Oh, yes.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you for coming.  Well, thank you.  It's really a pleasure.  You guys are great.  And I guess, well, Sam Roberts, you'll be up next with the after show?  That's exactly right.  Who do you got on there?  Yeah. 
[03:05:30]  Justin Long is actually coming in today.  Is he on drugs?  Hopefully.  Fingers crossed.  Yesterday was a big success.  Yeah.  All right.  And, of course, thank everybody.  E-Rock and Travis and everything.  And I guess, you know, I know it's a little early.  If we're not dead, we'll be here tomorrow.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  Well, I wish I were.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  You wish we're dead?  No.  I wish I were going to be here tomorrow.  What a sad way to end this fun interview.  Geez.  That was either a very good or a very bad review of your show. 
[03:06:00]  All right.  And we might be better.  You'll hear me do reads.  How about that?  I'll treat you with some reads.  Thank you.  The O.P. and Anthony Show on Sirius XM.  This is After O.P. and Anthony Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  All right.  It's after show time. 
[03:06:30]  I said it on the main show, but Justin Long, you know, he was the Mac guy.  He was in a ton of movies.  Waiting.  Die Hard.  He was in Live Free or Die Hard.  He was in Movie 43.  He was in Dodgeball.  Ed.  Ed?  Ed, yeah.  New Girl.  He was on the show Ed?  Yeah.  Wasn't it an old show?  Yeah, it was on NBC for like two or three years.  Was he young?  Yeah.  Interesting.  Well, he'll be on the show and I can only hope that he's all fucked up because otherwise 
[03:07:00]  it's a tough act to follow yesterday.  Let me go to 617 to start the show.  866-WOW1-WOW is the phone number, by the way.  617, you're on the air.  Hey, Professor Broadcaster.  How are you, pal?  Great.  How are you?  I'm awesome.  You know, Anthony is a really funny fucker and I have been listening to you guys forever.  Yeah.  But oh my god, his segues, I'm sorry, he is not a very good radio host.  How do you mean? 
[03:07:30]  Ah, come on.  At the end of the show, very uncomfortable, but very funny, but very uncomfortable.  I mean, he's got a lot of, he doesn't have opus flair.  He doesn't have his...  What specifically were you talking about?  I didn't really pick up on it.  Well...  I'm not saying it's wrong, necessarily.  I didn't pick up on any uncomfortability.  He seems comfortable behind the microphone.  He doesn't have the smoothness that Opie does.  This is how we get out of this and segues.  You know, I work in TV and...  Excuse me.  Oh, excuse Mr. Entertainment on the phone. 
[03:08:00]  You've got an expert there.  But what TV?  Yeah.  What TV do you work in?  Okay.  What TV?  I'm a director for one of the affiliates in Boston here.  Oh, like a news channel?  Yeah, and I do a lot of live TV and stuff like that.  Do you cover high school sports?  Hang on, everybody's talking at once.  So do you have to sit there and deal with news anchors that can't speak unless they're  written out for?  Oh, they're glass readers, yeah.  That's all they do, right?  Now, you tell me.  Because we were trying to figure out with this Yeah Baby thing that we aired yesterday. 
[03:08:30]  I don't know if you heard it, but Conan put together a montage that we aired.  Mike Myers had a second kid.  And every local news anchor in the country goes, yeah, baby.  Mike Myers is saying, yeah, baby.  And I'm telling you, somewhere between 15 and 30 news anchors said this quote.  Now, you tell me.  Is there some kind of service that is writing bad jokes and puns for these people?  Yeah, you talked about it.  No, it's not writing bad jokes and puns. 
[03:09:00]  It's the AP.  So the AP is putting out like a little cute headline like that and everybody just takes  it?  That's the way, yeah.  It's insane.  It's written about Mike Myers and they, you know, grip it and rip it.  And that's pretty much how it works because they have so many other things going on.  They have, you know, breaking news, local news, national news.  And when it comes to an entertainment story, that's the last thing.  You know, you got a limited, even though we're in one of the top ten markets in the country, 
[03:09:30]  you have a limited amount of writers and producers and people get lazy.  And yeah, they don't realize that their laziness is going to cause them to look like a bunch  of retards.  Exactly.  Like...  Oh, trust me, there's plenty of things that have nothing to do with that that still make  them look like retards.  You would think, you would think after Anchorman came out and everybody became familiar with  the I'm Ron Burgundy thing that they would be okay.  Ladies and gentlemen, people are on to us.  They made a whole movie about it and everybody's laughing.  Now we have to be on high alert to make sure we don't do anything humiliating like that. 
[03:10:00]  One quick story and then I'll go.  Please.  So I'm one of the premier broadcasters in this market, got old, kind of, you know, was  further on his career, worked at a small station.  I was directing.  We used to, when we, you know, the producers write scripts and they put them in a prompter  and then we had to put these pages in that said, dummy page, when it came to a commercial 
[03:10:30]  break.  And the anchors reading the T's going into the commercial break.  And we get to that.  She forgot to took it, take it out of the prompter.  And he reads this.  This is a dummy page.  You read that on the air?  Yes.  I need you to be on high alert and stuff like that.  And you could send it to us anonymously.  I will.  I'll let you know.  Because I got it.  I got it.  I got to become aware.  This is a dummy page.  Greatest moment ever.  And I was sitting in the chair and it got really quiet and everybody. 
[03:11:00]  And I just, did he really just read that in the air?  Did everybody hear that?  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  And then when something like that happens, is there a boss that comes down on the anchor  and says, stop being a fucking idiot and just read it?  Like, use one part of your brain before you go on television and read.  No, this guy was 60-something years old, end of his career.  He was the dean of Boston Broadcasting is what they used to call him.  So, you know, they don't care.  He has, you know, three martini lunches and goes back and does the news. 
[03:11:30]  And it's amazing.  It's those people, too, that make the biggest blunders.  Those people, wow, he's an institution here in Boston.  He's a Hall of Fame broadcaster.  And meanwhile, he's announcing on the news that it's a dummy page.  Oh, not only that, okay, so another one last story is there was no break page.  So we go to the B.  What's a break page?  A break page is to say this is the commercial break.  Gotcha.  Okay.  So there's no break page and the next piece of script was the first story in the B block,  which is after the commercial break. 
[03:12:00]  Okay.  But there was no break page, so he starts reading the next story.  So now the music's playing and he's doing another news story.  And now what the fuck do I do?  Of course.  Because you're sitting there.  You know, drop his mic, fade to black, let's get the fuck out of this.  Oh, that's just like, I guess you can't skip a commercial break?  No, no, no.  You can't bring the music down and then start the news again.  You're teasing the fucking break.  So you just have to turn his mic off.  Exactly.  Just put him out of his misery. 
[03:12:30]  Fade the music out, go to black, roll a break, and we'll fucking regroup when we get back.  I love it.  Well, you're welcome to call up and tell news stories anytime.  I don't want to hear any more criticisms of Mr. Anthony Cumia.  But if you want to come up and criticize the people you work with, I would love to hear  it.  Alright, next time I will, pal.  Alright, buddy.  I'll talk to you later.  Bye.  Hey, man.  Fuck.  Fuck criticizing Anthony.  He does fine, man.  That's how you did a great job today.  Hey, Sammy.  Hey, man.  Best of the best. 
[03:13:00]  That goes to you.  And for E-Rock in the building...  What a great call.  You know what I want to do for you?  You there?  Yes, sir.  I'm going to give you a copy of Pacific Rim on Blu-Ray.  How does that sound?  You're fucking awesome, man.  Alright, buddy.  Stay on hold.  That was a great call.  That was just a terrific, concise...  Got everybody.  So, E-Rock, that's line two.  I don't know if the intern's in there.  Yeah, I hung up on that.  Okay.  920.  Hey, Sam.  It's Pirate Trucker.  What's up, buddy?  I picked up on the uncomfortableness, too. 
[03:13:30]  But I equated it to John Lithgow was a big, freaking bore.  Absolutely borefest.  Well, I said that.  Look, John Lithgow, I guess, he's a nice old man.  Like, he's here, he sings songs to children.  He lives in a world that all of us that are so entrenched in the Opie and Anthony world  have no idea about.  Like, he's sitting there and he's playing guitar so he can sing to children.  Yesterday, we spent the majority of the show making pedophile jokes.  So, it's two separate universes that somehow come together. 
[03:14:00]  And I don't think Anthony is uncomfortable at all on the air.  I think it's just a matter of you do a show for a certain number of years  and you get used to your roles on the show and now Anthony is doing something  that he normally doesn't do.  And it's simple stuff.  Like, you know, whatever.  Throwing to break or coming back from break or whatever it is.  He's not used to doing that.  Within two shows, it would be as if he's been doing it all his life. 
[03:14:30]  I mean, he's been broadcasting for many years.  Well, I thought he did a good job.  I just thought it was one of those...  They were pregnant pauses where Opie would have said something uncomfortable  or pissed off the guest and Anthony would have laughed.  And since Opie wasn't there, it was like, oh, okay.  I am in no place to talk about uncomfortable interviews after what happened in this room yesterday.  I mean, I feel like we're in the middle of a crime scene right now after what went down in here yesterday. 
[03:15:00]  Let me go to 952.  You're on the air.  Hi.  I have a question about Jocktober's intro.  Uh-huh.  Nice to talk to you, by the way.  You too.  I was wondering what the first song is on that.  Hey, Eric, do you have any idea what the first song is on the Jocktober intro?  I think it's just some kind of production bed we have.  Yeah, I think it's just like circus music that Troy found.  That little whistle music?  Yeah, I think so.  What's going on?  All right. 
[03:15:30]  Thanks, buddy.  605.  No Blu-ray for him.  605.  You're on the air.  Hello?  What's up, buddy?  Hello?  Yeah.  Sam?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  That's who it is.  Yeah, I would imagine.  I thought Anthony did frickin' great today.  Of course.  Look, Anthony is not some fuckin' rookie who needs people to call up here and say how great  he did, but you're 100% right, 605.  What's your name?  My name's Josh.  Josh, you're with me.  Anthony's a guy who is a comic genius. 
[03:16:00]  He's a broadcasting genius.  He's been doing this for years.  He knows what he's doing.  It goes without saying.  A fucker blocked me on Twitter, but whatever.  He probably had good reason.  I trust him.  I don't know why he did, actually, but whatever.  I just want to say, those guys are idiots.  Anthony's awesome.  Of course he's awesome.  Thank you, buddy.  423.  Hey, Sam.  I was in meetings all morning.  I came into the Lithgow thing a little late, and I swear to you, I thought you guys  found the pedophile.  Come on.  He was talking about kids and playing guitars and singing. 
[03:16:30]  I thought you had found one from yesterday.  I guess in context.  In context, everything gets weird.  Phones are blowing up.  Everybody wants to chat, but ladies and gentlemen, what are you smiling at, Sal?  No, Eric's yelling at Yuri.  Why is he yelling at you?  He's just...  I thought his name is Jack.  I don't know.  I couldn't...  Yuri is the intern who's from Russia, who prefers to be called Jack.  Ladies and gentlemen, DJ Hookit is in the house.  DJ Hookit is here.  Hey.  How are you doing, my friend?  Chilling, man.  Where the monkeys at, man?  What? 
[03:17:00]  Oh, you always come in here when your enemies are here.  No.  No.  John Lithgow was there at Planet of the Apes.  I thought you had a monkey with him.  John Lithgow was in Planet of the Apes?  Yeah.  Well, Eric, was John Lithgow in Planet of the Apes?  The new ones.  The new one, I think he was.  Oh, okay.  Alright, alright.  Wanted to throw you under the bus.  I thought he was bringing a monkey up here.  We got you on the Johnny Carson thing.  I was hoping we were getting you on something else.  Not today, though.  I'm looking it up.  Dude, you know who's here?  Who?  The boss.  The boss.  No.  Is he still here, Eric?  Rick Ross is here?  Yeah, he's in Sway. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah, he's in Sway.  It's been great, guys.  Ricky Rosé is here.  I'm pussy.  I'm out.  Last time you were here...  Ja Rule.  What is going on over there?  Ja Rule was here.  Every time I come up here, you got like 50s enemies next door.  Is Rick Ross really still at Sway?  I'm gonna go peek, but the last time I saw him.  I haven't seen him leave.  I'm gonna go peek.  Eric, if Rick Ross is still in this building...  Want me to go tell him something?  You put your head...  You walk into Sway's studio and say,  Rick Ross is somebody who would like to talk to you,  and we're gonna get Hookah to apologize to him tonight.  Get the fuck out of here. 
[03:18:00]  He's probably taking a shit in the bathroom while you piss him.  I'll walk him right in.  Just go see if Rick Ross is here.  He's in there like...  I'm taking a shit.  Because we talked about your thing with Ja Rule last week.  You didn't know Rick Ross was gonna be here?  Nah, I wouldn't have even been here.  Rick Ross has a huge beef with 50 Cent,  and of course, 50 Cent is DJ Hookah's employer.  Yeah, but I think the beef is over, though.  I don't think the...  Well, you know, who knows?  Yeah, but you never know.  I mean...  A neck is always available to be squeezed.  And you're usually the neck that gets squeezed.  I'm not trying to be the one that's available. 
[03:18:30]  Right.  Is he still here, are you, Rock?  Nah, he's gone.  That's a shame.  Nah, I'll stay.  You must have heard Hookah was coming.  He might still be in the building, though.  Ah, shit.  I bet he's downstairs.  Waiting for DJ Hookah.  My God.  Man, I miss John.  Look out, man.  I wanted to see his little pet monkey.  He has a monkey.  You didn't know that?  He has it in his pocket.  I had no...  He's brought it with him today?  Yeah.  That's incredible.  We didn't...  He called...  No, I don't think that's true.  Did he really say that?  He seemed like a nice man when we talked to him.  He looked like a pedophile.  I don't think... 
[03:19:00]  I don't think so.  I think that's totally uncalled for DJ Hookah.  Really distasteful, too, if you ask me.  He tastes kids, you said?  No, I didn't say that.  Johnny in Ohio.  Hi, Sam.  Hey, I wanted to compliment you and Jimmy on yesterday's interview with Jenna.  Mm-hmm.  And in all honesty, at first I thought you guys were going to sweep it under the rug.  Because she's Jimmy's friend, apparently.  And when I checked your guys' webpages and everything, I didn't see anything about it.  Well, we were...  The one comment you made.  Yeah, no. 
[03:19:30]  We were at home...  I went home immediately after the after show.  Mm-hmm.  And started editing that video.  It's up on YouTube now.  The Jenna Jameson interview.  Thank you very much for the compliment, Johnny.  I'm my homegirl, because my weed dealer met up with her before she came up here.  I don't know if that's true or not.  You say that, DJ Hookah.  All right.  And I'll credit that information to you.  My boy.  I know he is.  And you're usually very trustworthy.  I just can't get behind something.  No, I don't be lying about shit like that, God.  I don't even know what you're saying anymore.  You call me God.  Woo!  Anyway, Jenna Jameson was in here yesterday. 
[03:20:00]  And I don't know if you've seen the video.  The pussy boy.  I didn't see the pussy, unfortunately.  I would've loved it.  You have Jenna Jameson up here, the queen of porn, and you don't see pussy.  Jenna Jameson was in rare condition yesterday.  That's what I'm saying.  My boy met up with her before she came up here.  I don't know for sure.  But there was...  It wasn't the most comfortable interview we've ever had.  She seemed...  She seemed like she was having some rough times.  Yeah.  We posted the video.  If you search on YouTube, you could just go Jenna Jameson, Sam Roberts, Jim Norton. 
[03:20:30]  There's the three of us in here together.  I'm so mad I missed that.  Yeah, dude.  You gotta look it up.  Not Sam is my YouTube channel.  You gotta see it.  It's like 20 minutes long.  I posted almost the whole...  No way.  We had it for like 35 minutes.  I posted most of the interview.  What?  But the thing's gotten...  I posted it last night.  It's got 20,000 hits on it already.  Get the fuck out of here.  I mean, people...  And people are going, what the fuck happened?  All right.  This is how I'm gonna tell you that my boy really met her before she came up here.  Okay.  My boy told me that she had like spit on the side of her face.  Like dry spit. 
[03:21:00]  Okay.  I don't know.  Answer this question.  Uh-huh.  Did she have dry spit on the side of her left cheek?  It's possible.  It's possible.  All right.  That's it.  That's all I gotta say.  It's possible.  Matt in Charlotte.  What's up?  Primetime Sam Roberts.  How's it going, buddy?  Good, man.  Hey, that was the most uncomfortable conversation I've ever heard on the radio.  You know, we didn't know what to expect because she's promoting a book and it's an erotica  novel.  She's trying to get some women to have a little one-handed read, if you know what I mean. 
[03:21:30]  Pussy.  What are they doing with the other hand, who, kid?  Very vaginal.  That's right.  That's right.  No, you're exactly right.  Did she look as bad as she sounded?  Dude, look it up yourself.  I posted the video so I wouldn't have to make any derogatory comments.  What sounds was she making?  You got it.  Who, kid?  You rock, baby.  Good looking, man.  Thank you.  She was making weird sounds.  She was laughing.  Her voice was deep.  She was crying.  She was crying?  A couple times.  Yeah.  Get the fuck out of that.  Yo, pull up that video, guys. 
[03:22:00]  Bring Sal in here.  Watch her for a second.  Can't be serious.  Uh, Brian in Virginia.  Sam, I thought that Anthony did an absolutely fantastic job.  And I think Opie would have ruined things with his, like, short draw.  Enough about this nonsense.  Anthony and Opie are both very good at what they do.  Come on, man.  I think Anthony's a little better.  Okay, alright.  Relax.  Relax.  Relax.  Opie and Anthony.  And if you ask me, I don't know what the fuck happens.  Why are they choosing? 
[03:22:30]  There's no choice.  Okay, what's going on today?  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Exactly.  What's going on today?  You don't get to become as famous, as well-respected as Opie and Anthony are,  and only have one talented guy.  It's two equally talented broadcasting giants that are in this studio.  Where's Sal?  I don't know.  Is he gonna come in and video this thing for me in a few minutes?  Sure he will.  She looks hot, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Specifically, do you think?  Well, you can look it up yourself, but we'll show the visual to you. 
[03:23:00]  Jenna Jameson.  Okay.  She's crying, God.  Jim gives her the tissues.  Yeah.  See?  A lot of surgery there.  Justin Long's coming in here in a few minutes.  Nah, kid.  Say it right here.  Jeepers Creepers, God.  Is he in Jeepers Creepers?  Hell yeah.  That's great.  Here she is crying a little bit.  I don't understand.  Mm-hmm.  And I hope that he gets sober.  Is that the problem?  What are you laughing at?  This shit is funny, God.  No, it's not. 
[03:23:30]  It's a woman falling apart.  You're heartless.  You're smoking that shit.  Listen, I don't know what you're doing.  You can watch the video for yourself.  How would I go with that spit?  I told you.  Even though her face is white, you can still see the spit.  You can watch the video for yourself on the Not Sam channel on YouTube.  That's that pussy.  Have you ever talked to Jenna Jameson?  Yeah, I talked to her a long time.  But we're in a happy state.  Not crying and spit on her face.  It was sad.  You cried too, buddy?  I didn't cry.  You didn't cry. 
[03:24:00]  But I'm going to tell you something.  Get out of here, man.  Do you know what I did?  I prepped, of course, for the Jenna Jameson interview.  Oh, did you?  I did a prep.  Look at the pussy.  No.  You look up interviews.  You see what she's going on.  You look at her Twitter feed.  That's when I knew stuff was going wrong.  But I did masturbate to Jenna Jameson the night before.  See, that's where the respect comes in for you, my brother.  You like that?  You're a brother.  Because I sat there and I was looking at all this Jenna Jameson stuff and I was like,  I remember how hot this chick was.  Real research.  And so, yeah. 
[03:24:30]  And you know what I did?  And this is a little humiliating.  My wife was sleeping.  She caught you, no.  No.  Okay.  But I snuck out of the bedroom.  Okay.  That's normal.  Got my phone, went into the bathroom, shut the door, found some Jenna Jameson porn on  one of the mobile free sites.  It's getting there.  Jerked off.  Yeah.  And I put the, I propped up the phone on the tiles.  No way.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:25:00]  So I could look straight.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I jerked off.  You had a stick it?  In the toilet.  No, I didn't have a stick it.  I jerked off, put it in the toilet.  Yeah.  Cleaned up, washed up.  Oh, yeah.  Came back in the bedroom.  And my wife had woken up by that point.  Hey.  Realized I was in the bathroom for so long.  And she goes, babe, are you okay?  Yeah.  She thought I was having some tummy problems.  Shit.  She thought I was taking a massive shit while I was in the bathroom.  And I was like, yeah, no, I'm fine.  But that's what happens. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah.  I'm sitting there thinking as I'm going to sleep, okay, what am I going to talk to Jenna  about tomorrow?  And the more you think about Jenna, the more you think about the titties and the ass.  And the pussy.  And the pussy.  And so then you go and you jerk off.  Then...  She came in.  She came in.  With the spit and the crying.  And I thought about the woman that I had jerked off to the night before.  It's not the same.  Made me sad.  And that's what made me sad.  Was Sal crying too?  Sal, did you cry a little bit?  I did jerk off too.  Oh, you jerked off.  You did?  Last night?  Yeah, last night.  I did the night before last when I was prepping for the interview. 
[03:26:00]  So the whole ONA cast did research for Jenna?  But Sal's is a little more psychopathic.  Because he saw this woman break down.  A mess.  Yeah.  And then...  He started laughing.  Oh, I gotta jerk off to this.  So Sal was actually jerking off to me interviewing her.  Wow.  Which is like...  I don't know if I like that.  Well, no, it was just...  I don't mind it.  Because I got an ego.  It gave me like...  It gave me like some sort of...  What's the word I'm looking for?  Like...  Excitement?  No, it was like, okay, I feel better. 
[03:26:30]  Like, she had her heyday.  Where she is now.  Let me celebrate her heyday.  Yes.  So did you pinch it a little bit while you were watching the interview and then go to  the porn?  No, I didn't watch the interview until this morning, Sam.  And then this morning, were you like, oh, yeah, that's...  Yeah.  You're pinching it a little bit?  Yeah.  As long as he didn't eat his cum.  I think that's what white people do.  Did you eat your cum?  No, I don't...  I don't even like to look at it.  Good.  Good for you.  That's what white people do, I think.  Some Greek shit.  In the beginning stages of masturbation, you pinch it.  Thank God.  You pinch it a little bit.  You pinch it.  A little bit, right? 
[03:27:00]  What's that?  What's that?  You're pinching.  That's the Louis C.K. bit.  Oh, is it?  Yeah.  Does he pinch?  Well, he said, you know, when you're young, you start with the two fingers.  No, no, no, I meant...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Two fingers.  I meant, like, today, you start with pinching.  Like, not like when you're a kid, you pinch.  I mean, like, you're flaccid.  Right.  And you start pinching.  And you're like, you start getting some feeling down there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Then you start growing.  And you're like, okay, right.  So you start with the pinching.  Where's that from?  Like, not getting circumcised?  I'm circumcised.  Who cares? 
[03:27:30]  Okay.  I got this weird thing.  I don't give a shit.  I'll say it.  Tell me.  Like, when I first put on porn, like, when I start getting horny, I sneeze.  What?  I don't know what the fuck it is.  What?  It's a real weird thing.  Because you're allergic to vagina.  Just follow what God intended you to follow.  Because you're fucking tight.  He's giving you every signal that the vagina's not for you.  I did research to it, and it has to do with, like, hormones and stuff rushing to the brain.  Did you go to your allergist?  No.  It's not to be allergic to it.  Did you go to your allergist and say, look, I don't know if it's I'm allergic to pre-cum. 
[03:28:00]  I don't know if it's vaginas I'm allergic to.  I don't know.  Every time I get it.  I think I'm allergic to nipples.  No, it's like an evolutionary thing.  And I don't know.  And apparently I'm not evolved.  Yeah.  Because I don't sneak.  I'm, like, technically less evolved.  I could have told you that.  Yeah.  Like Cro-Magnon.  Yeah.  But there was a lot of sneezing in the studio while Jenna was up here.  Next time.  Next time.  I'll tell you this, though.  Next time Laney brings up one of these porno stars.  Yeah. 
[03:28:30]  And Sal starts getting into a sneezing fit.  Wait a minute.  Weren't you sneezing during the gay off?  No.  Okay.  I don't know.  I'm going to have to look back at some of that tape.  Just a cold that day, Sal.  Just a cold?  Not Sal, man.  I just got a text from Justin Stangle from David Letterman.  Yeah.  He says, I will never hold your phone again.  I guess that's something for everybody to remember.  Next time you ought to borrow my phone.  But what else are you going to use, right?  What am I going to keep?  An iPad in the bathroom?  That's creepy.  I got one right here, guard.  You got the iPad mini?  The mini joint.  And is that mini?  With big pussy shots. 
[03:29:00]  Is that what you do?  You take your iPad into the bathroom and jerk off?  Do you jerk off?  You have so much sex.  Every day.  You do?  Yeah.  You have a voracious sexual appetite?  Is that right?  I want it out, man.  Wow.  Xvideos.com.  Is that what it is?  Yeah.  So, do you have sex with your wife?  No.  Okay.  You just jerk off and have sex with...  Are you fucking kidding me?  ...with groupies and porn stars instead?  Are you fucking kidding me?  Let me tell you something.  O&A on my idols.  Yeah.  I'm not trying to be fucking wives and all that.  That's just not normal.  Well, I still have sex with my wife.  Yeah, you're weird, but I can't fuck with that shit. 
[03:29:30]  You still have to rub one out, though, everyone.  Right.  It's like, you know, I don't want to put my wife through the process of having to have  sex with me more times than she'd like to.  Absolutely.  She already puts up with me a good one to three times a week.  No way.  Can you imagine forcing somebody to have sex with me more times than one to three times  a week?  I can't imagine having to make somebody sit through that.  So, yeah, I'm going to go.  If she's sitting there wrestling Sunday night, she's got a long day at work on Monday, I 
[03:30:00]  don't want to have to wake her up.  What am I going to start poking her?  Hey, wake up.  You already made her sit through, like, wrestling probably at that point, too, right?  Huh?  You made her sit in there wrestling on Sunday night?  Yeah!  And if there's not, I probably had some tapes on or something.  Hey, you want to watch Royal Rubble 2005?  I'd rather watch Jenna.  Jenna got like, what, 3,000 movies?  I'd rather watch her.  I don't know how many...  You'd rather watch Jenna Jameson than have sex with your wife?  The old Jenna.  The old Jenna.  The young pussy.  What are the chances of you jerking off to my interview with Jenna Jameson?  Uh, not much, because you're in it. 
[03:30:30]  I don't know if I can do it with you in it.  The shots keep going to my shitty afro and headphones.  Maybe if I look at the spit in the corner of her mouth, I might get a little roused.  You like that?  Yeah.  My God.  Well...  Smoking that shit.  Let me go to Kevin in Houston.  What's up, Kevin?  Hey, buddy.  How you doing?  What's up, Hoot Kid?  What up, Doug?  I have a question, Stan.  Do you think that maybe Roland could use our host will jerk off to you as a selling point  to get your guests on the show?  Well, I talked to Jenna Jameson about that a little bit. 
[03:31:00]  I asked her...  I was gonna tell her, I jerked off to her the night before, but then I asked her when  she's doing signings, you know, is this something that you find creepy or is it a compliment?  And she kinda made it seem like she was a little creeped out by it.  So I was like, alright, maybe we'll cease the information train right there.  Maybe I'll go draw on the e-brake before I go further with my big fat stupid mouth.  Did Roland get turned on with Jenna in here?  I'm sure he was pinching a little bit.  Did everybody come on his chest? 
[03:31:30]  I don't know if anybody came on Roland's chest.  He looked like he would like that.  Yeah?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I've never talked to him about specifically if he'd like having his chest come upon.  Honestly, she was pretty, but some things were a little rough around you.  Surgery.  Like in the video she looks good.  Like the way they do the makeup and stuff.  She knows what she's doing.  She knows how to pose for photos.  But it's also, her body looks better than it has.  She showed her booty off a little bit.  She did.  She gained some weight.  But there's also a thing like, she came in and she appeared to be in a state. 
[03:32:00]  And it was almost like, like I felt she shouldn't have been doing interviews.  Get outta here.  When I was looking at her.  So, I don't want to have sex with a woman who's in that state.  Cause it's so close to date rape.  Oh yeah.  You know what I mean?  Like this is not a woman making good decisions.  Just watching her sit down.  She was all like that slow motion.  Yeah.  Up high.  I could fall out of this chair at any moment.  So it was like you took advantage of that.  You took the pussy.  I didn't have sex with Jenna Jameson yesterday.  But you took it subliminally on air. 
[03:32:30]  You just snatched the pussy.  Like you took it.  You think I subliminally date raped somebody in an interview?  Yeah, on air.  You could've just been like, yo, you look fucked up right now.  You got spit on your cheek.  You're crying.  Come back another time.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know.  I mean, she asked to come in here.  Yeah, but you could've been like, come back next time.  You're crying.  You know.  She didn't start crying until halfway through the interview.  Why don't we talk about what's going on?  Like why don't you-  Sounds on the side like, ah shoo!  Do it!  Do it!  Ah!  They just said Justin Long will be here in a minute. 
[03:33:00]  Do you want to do the live read now and get it out of the way?  No, no, no.  Okay.  Because we don't have Justin Long until the end of the show.  Justin Long loves porno.  I thought that was a porno star coming up.  I didn't know it was the actor.  He's got a porno name.  It's Zack and Miri make a porno.  I pulled my dick out like, yo, the name is Justin Long, really.  Why would you pull your dick out?  His name is Long.  I thought it was a porno star, but it's just actually the actor.  So what- are you saying like, you were gonna get competitive?  Yeah, but what-  Like, let's see who's really Justin Long.  Nigga.  I get you. 
[03:33:30]  I'm with you, DJ Hooket.  I'm with you.  The chipmunks, nigga.  I mean, you might as well mention it.  Orange is the New Black, House of Cards, Arrested Development.  Yeah.  You know all these shows.  I love that show.  I love all- there's actually three different shows, but I love all of them.  The orange and the black one is crazy.  It is.  It is.  That's true.  Are you ready for the next big thing from Netflix?  Prepare yourself-  Uh-oh.  For Notorious, Netflix's newest comedy special starring international stand-up sensation,  Russell Peters.  Russell started doing stand-up as a kid in his native Toronto.  That's my nigga.  And now he's one of the biggest comedians in the world. 
[03:34:00]  Hell yeah.  With over 75 million views on YouTube, nearly a million Facebook fans, and one of the most  diverse audiences on the planet, he's sold out arenas like Madison Square Garden and Sydney's  Royal Opera House.  That's in Australia, DJ.  C'est pas vrai.  C'est pas vrai.  I don't know what that means.  Also, launching with Russell's new special, Notorious, is Russell Peters vs. the World,  an exclusive four-part series that takes you behind the scenes on Russell's tour and has 
[03:34:30]  tons of great outtakes and interviews with his family and friends.  Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire?  C'est pas vrai.  Don't miss Notorious and Russell Peters vs. the World, now streaming on Netflix.  C'est pas vrai.  C'est pas vrai.  C'est pas vrai.  C'est pas vrai.  C'est pas vrai.  C'est pas vrai.  C'est pas vrai.  C'est pas vrai.  Qu'est-ce que ça aété?  C'est pas vrai.  Sam?  What's up, buddy?  Hey, I was wondering if who could have any more of the ONA mixtapes  than if both you and him could sign them.  Yeah, we got one in the office we'll send to you. 
[03:35:00]  Stay on hold.  We still got some of those mixtapes, yep.  The Opie and Anthony mixtape.  TJ in Oklahoma.  Good morning, Samuel.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, what up, TJ?  Good kid.  What up, dog?  Hey, not much, brother.  I'll tell you what.  I listened to the replay of that interview yesterday, Janet,  and it was depressing.  It sounded like she was either drunk as hell or on some kind of drugs.  I don't know what's going on in her life. 
[03:35:30]  She's smoking ass shit.  I don't know what's going on in her life,  but it was nice of her to stop by.  Matt in New Jersey.  Samson, I missed this morning's show, unfortunately,  so if you guys talked about this, I apologize,  but did you guys check out Page Six of the New York Post today?  Yeah, well, Jenna Jameson did Good Day New York  before she did, after Opie and Anthony live yesterday.  Oh, okay.  And they cut her segments.  What?  That's why she came in to do our show early yesterday,  because she got on TV,  and they thought she was fucked up, or whatever. 
[03:36:00]  That's what it says on TMZ.  So they cut her segment and ended it early.  So you're not allowed to get high and get on TV anymore?  I guess they probably didn't feel like she was the guest they thought she would be.  Well, Snoop be on TV all the time.  That's true.  And Jim brought it up.  He said they should have just talked to her,  but the problem is, like,  I don't think anybody wants to sip their coffee  and watch Good Day New York  while Jenna Jameson's crying about trying to get custody of her children.  I would.  You would.  That's because you're a sociopathic individual. 
[03:36:30]  What up, Sal?  Sal's over here sneezing.  What's going on with Justin Long, Eric?  We're still waiting on him.  It's been a minute.  Spencer came in and said he'll be here in a minute,  and then I haven't seen him ever.  That's my boy, though.  He's cool as fuck, though.  Justin Long?  Well, you know Justin Long.  He was in Zack and Mary Make a Porno  while we're talking about pornos.  Chipmunks, nigga.  Dodgeball.  He was in the Chipmunks.  Die Hard.  Die Hard.  Live Free or Die Hard.  Now he's in a new movie.  It's called Best Man. 
[03:37:00]  Well, he's got a couple new movies coming out.  Oh, there you go.  One is called Best Man Down.  The other, which is, I think it's like a...  Somebody getting killed at a wedding?  I haven't seen it.  It's a Best Man Down.  I don't know, whatever.  No, I haven't seen it, but apparently his character, he gets married,  and right after his wedding, his best man dies,  so he has to cancel his honeymoon and go to his funeral.  Oh, okay.  It's not like Black Hawk Down, like in Africa.  It's not a war movie, no. 
[03:37:30]  Maybe it's killing white people.  Yeah, no, I don't think it is that.  I don't think Justin Long would have anything to do with that, quite frankly.  All right.  The other one is A Case of You.  Justin Long actually wrote that movie.  Oh, that's his little experiment right there?  It's not an experiment.  Wait till you hear this cast.  Peter Dinklage, Vince Vaughn, Brendan Fraser, Sam Rockwell.  Oh, he's serious, man.  He's not fucking around, hoot kid.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  So he'll be in here in just a second.  He was also the Mac guy in all the Apple commercials. 
[03:38:00]  Oh, yeah, that's right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So it should be very exciting.  What do you got going on?  You better have a chipmunk with him.  I don't know if he actually travels with the chipmunks.  I don't think so.  My boy.  Oh, okay, here we go.  No, here he comes.  Justin Long.  Welcome.  Please come in.  Long time.  What up, kid?  What up, son?  What up, God?  You guys go back.  How's it going, Justin?  Sit down.  Make yourself comfortable.  Thank you.  Thanks, man.  Justin Long is here.  You guys, am I following 3-6 Mafia and or John Lithgow? 
[03:38:30]  Oh, man.  Well, because that wasn't just a random.  That's happening.  John Lithgow was in here a little earlier.  Let me tell you what you're following.  And this is going to be, this is a lot of pressure for you, unfortunately.  Jenna Jameson was in here yesterday.  No shit.  In rare form.  Oh, please tell me.  Well, we were thinking unless, like, you come in here completely fucked up, I don't know  if we're going to be able to get the same attention for you that we got for Jenna yesterday. 
[03:39:00]  I should have had my dick out.  I knew it.  I told you.  My man, yo.  Damn it.  Always trust your instincts.  Don't listen to the publicist.  They're always going to steer you wrong, Justin.  It's just that I tuck.  Just for the listeners, I am naked from the waist down.  Oh, I didn't mention that.  Yeah.  You should have led with it.  I was real led with it.  Yeah.  He came in, tucked in.  And I tried to research what pills I thought Jenna might be on and be on the same shit.  But it's hard to find that information.  She told me in the interview yesterday that she's been sober for seven years. 
[03:39:30]  Oh, wow.  Oh, gosh.  I should have made that joke.  No, but, however.  Poorly timed.  However.  The conversation we were having did not lead me to believe that that was a fact.  Right, right.  So maybe what you said was okay.  The insistence that she's sober might have been.  It spit on her left cheek like an item of drug usage.  Wait, a spit?  Like a dry spit.  Oh, like a baby spittle?  Yeah.  She was drooling.  Who kid wasn't even.  From her eye?  How did it come out of her cheek?  No, no.  It was on her cheek.  Oh, like right in the corner. 
[03:40:00]  From her mouth.  Was it that kind of frothy.  That's my man right here.  Well, who kid wasn't even here yesterday, but he keeps insisting there was some kind of  dry spittle.  My drug dealer guy met up with her and sold her some drugs, like some weed or whatever.  Yeah.  And then he caught the dry thing.  You know what I'm saying?  I'm so curious about it.  It was, how far away from her mouth was it?  It was like, I guess like half an inch.  I don't know if any of it's true.  I think you might be making the whole thing up.  What a weird line.  What a weird thing to make up.  But that's a very DJ hooky thing. 
[03:40:30]  Oh, observation, man.  He'll come in.  He's got like a child's brain.  There's a nuance to his line.  Yeah.  It's like a subtlety that's an art.  I think it's smart, too, because people assume he's not a liar because the things that  he's saying.  Why would you ever, yeah.  And how can you confirm or deny that?  Right.  And even if Jenna Jameson were here now, she probably wouldn't even remember having  a spit on us.  And there's so much for Jenna Jameson to deny.  Right.  Spittle is probably so far down on the list.  Yeah.  And to top it off, y'all didn't even talk about her big pussy. 
[03:41:00]  Like, what's the purpose of it?  Well, I don't know if it's specifically big is the only thing, is it?  It's got to be big.  3,000 movies?  Come on.  Is that a...  This is probably a dumb question, but is that an old wife's tale?  Speaking of big pussy, it's an old wife's tale.  Yeah.  Tail.  Like, is that that if you're a porn star, you would have a larger...  Stretched out.  Is that...  Is that true?  I mean, I feel like the women can have babies, so there's got to be some kind of elasticity.  Yeah.  How could you not have asked her that? 
[03:41:30]  I mean, we had a lot of ground to cover you.  She spent half hour on the spittle, on the phantom spittle.  Right, right, right.  It was all about trying to confirm the spittle.  No pussy talk at all.  Whatever some pussy talk.  She said she hadn't had sex in seven months.  Is she married?  Is she married?  Look, it's a whole thing.  That's right.  She was married to Tito.  And I don't want to talk about Janet Jameson.  She was married to Tito Ortiz.  Right.  He now has her children.  She doesn't have custody.  She was crying over it.  It was...  We should just not say anything about it.  It was...  I mean, it's been said.  Yeah.  So I wouldn't worry about it too much. 
[03:42:00]  I'm angry today because John Lithgow was here.  He didn't have no monkeys with him.  I mean, you didn't even bring a chipmunk, man.  I'm like, fuck you.  By the way, that is the quickest transition from Janet Jameson to John Lithgow.  Congratulations.  And right back to you, by the way.  And right back to Chipmunks.  Jameson, Lithgow, Chipmunks.  Is there...  Who kid, when I told him you were coming in today, said he better have a chipmunk with  him, which I said...  I was going crazy.  Almost.  Definitely won't.  Watch that shit.  My son got hard watching that shit.  Come on.  How do you know? 
[03:42:30]  I don't know.  It's my kid.  And Justin, you have to be rethinking some choices you've made in your career at this  point.  I'm just trying to figure out the number of wrong things there were in that sentence.  My son is going hard right now.  It's just horrible.  I mean, literally.  No, but...  How...  But figuratively hard.  I mean...  How old is your son, by the way?  I don't know.  Like 13?  But I wanted to ask you about your son.  You posted a thing on Instagram.  Yeah.  What's a trap lord?  It was a drug guy.  Okay.  That's what I thought.  DJ who kid, this morning.  Yeah.  He posted a picture on Instagram of his son on his way to school. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah.  And he's got his son wearing a big yellow leaf that says Trap Lord on it.  Yeah.  And I assume that meant Lord of Drug Dealers.  It's a big artist called A$AP Berg.  He knows Three Six Mafia, so...  Mm-hmm.  But he's a trap lord.  And what is...  It's like a poncho?  They make ponchos?  It's like a big hoodie, like, you know...  Uh-oh.  And what does trap lord exactly mean?  Like he sells crack.  Okay.  That's fine.  He's going to school.  You said that so matter-of-factly.  Oh, he sells crack. 
[03:43:30]  But he's going to a white school.  You know what I'm saying?  How old did you say he was?  I do know what you're saying.  Thirteen.  Thirteen.  Okay.  He's old enough to sell crack.  He's going to a good school.  It's not like he's going to the hood.  He's in a white spot.  Oh, so no one's going to spot it.  Nah, nah, nah, nah.  Right.  Unless they listen to the opening Anthony show.  White teachers don't know shit about that.  You know what I'm saying?  Nah, nah, nah.  And if they do, there's something wrong with them.  They're going to get out.  They're going to out themselves.  And they're probably so afraid of being accused of racism that they can't even bring up the  crack references.  I'd love to hear it, though, reenacted in a black comedian's white person voice. 
[03:44:00]  He's like, Traplord, I know what that is.  That is a crack, uh...  You know, you shouldn't really be wearing a sweatshirt that says Traplord on it.  Traplord, more like, uh, Crack-Lord.  I know your game.  Oh, wow.  I'm looking at a picture of, uh...  What does the sweatshirt say?  He's half-Asian, by the way.  You know, he's a little mix.  He's a great-looking kid.  Yeah, Bruce Leroy.  He's into Alvin and the Chipmunks?  Uh, yeah, very much.  And also, apparently, crack.  Dropping my wild sons off at school, bumping. 
[03:44:30]  Hashtag Shabaranks?  I don't know what that means.  What is Shabaranks?  That's the number one song by A$AP Ferg, the Trap Lord.  The Trap Lord.  God, I feel white.  And of course...  It's okay.  Bobby Darin.  Are the kids listening to Bobby Darin anymore?  And of course, he got on his...  A$AP Ferg.  Okay, there you go.  I almost said a sap feo.  Hoodie on.  What does that mean?  SMH.  Shake my head.  Is that what it is?  That's what the kids are all saying.  I knew that one.  No shit.  Come on, Josh.  Shake my head. 
[03:45:00]  Shake my head.  Why would they shake their head?  Because he's going like this.  Oh, my kid, wearing a drug dealer sweatshirt.  Oh, this silly kid.  Thanks for translating into white.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what it is?  Shake my head.  You never knew that one before?  No, shake my head.  I just found out about LOL.  Kind of like white people would put their hand on their hip and kind of point their finger  going, oh, you, shaking my head.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We did take that to white people.  Hands on hips.  H-O-H.  Did you say you just learned about LOL?  No, I'm kidding. 
[03:45:30]  But my dad, he's 74.  He's a philosophy professor.  And he is super gangster.  Oh, wow.  But old school, like Thomas Aquinas shit.  Oh, shit.  Like Augustine balling.  But he, Traplert, sorry.  That's funny.  I'm going to show you another Traplert.  Please.  I like the hashtags, too.  Well, you know what I don't like?  I don't like that there's two of us here, and DJ Hooket is sucking us into his world.  I feel like, you know.  Okay, you show it to Justin. 
[03:46:00]  Yeah, we should tell you about Jersey Boys.  What the hell is that?  Which is two women.  We call it the pancake.  What is it, Hooket?  Explain to me the picture you just showed us.  We're stacking bitches right now.  Stacking bitches.  There's two vaginas in the photo you just showed me.  Well, by the way, they're not disembodied vaginas.  They are connected to bodies.  It's like Ed Gein's basement.  The human centipede, we stack the bitches.  Oh, my God.  By the way, this is not a photo that Hooket found on the Internet.  This is a personal photo that he took. 
[03:46:30]  Is that true?  Yeah, that's me.  That's me on the side right there.  I didn't want you to see my cock, so I cut it out.  That's nice of you.  Respect.  Thank you.  Thank you.  So there's...  Okay.  So you just took the...  And what do you say?  Do you have to say, like, heads up?  I'm taking the...  Do you have to give the money?  No, I said, let's do the pancake, and I'm going to take a photo.  And they knew what that meant right away.  Yeah, and then I go inside both of them.  Depends on the caliber of women that you're hanging out with.  By the way, you don't have to change the condom, because they both love each other.  Save it for the marriage vow.  Yeah, I'm already married.  Don't get all romantic on it. 
[03:47:00]  I'm already married.  You're getting a little sentimental on us.  What?  Pookie came in saying, he better have a chipmunk with him.  What is the project that you're most often associated with?  Are you the Mac guy?  Are you the dodgeball guy?  It depends, you know, and I can never...  I've seen a lot of...  There's Jeepers Creepers.  A lot of people still...  Didn't I bring that up?  Yes, you did.  It tends to be a thing that non-white people reference. 
[03:47:30]  Be it Asian.  Oh, okay.  I thought that was just your way of saying black.  Bangladeshi?  No, no.  No, it's a movie that whites have not...  Jeepers Creepers?  It's true, yeah.  But many...  And in fact, when I saw it for the first time, they didn't have a premiere for it.  They just kind of dumped it out.  They didn't think people were going to see it.  And I saw it in my hometown in Bridgeport, next to my hometown in Bridgeport, Connecticut.  What?  Seriously? 
[03:48:00]  Yeah, with my mom.  And we were the only two...  Packed, sold-out theater.  The only two white people in the entire audience.  I'm not kidding.  I swear to God.  And it's so fun.  It was so fun watching it with that audience because they were just, you know...  Scared out of their mind.  But yelling things, too.  And my character...  Because my character does some really stupid things in the movie.  I go back and investigate things.  And you do horror movie things that you got to do.  And there were three enormous women in front of me who were just hating me.  Oh, he better not go back.  Oh, he going to get his ass killed. 
[03:48:30]  Oh, I hope he dies.  And furious.  That stupid white boy.  Oh, good.  Oh, they got him.  At the end, spoiler alert, if you haven't seen it.  So, I die in the end and they take my eyes out.  And my mom...  Yeah, yeah.  That was crazy.  Yes, it was.  Case in point.  And my mom was sobbing and touching me.  Oh, they die in your beautiful eyes.  They take it.  And I was like, Mom, it's a movie.  And I'm trying to calm her down.  And as we're getting up to go, the credits are rolling.  And the three ladies in front of me were like, good. 
[03:49:00]  I'm glad he died.  That stupid white boy.  Why did he go down there?  Of course he's going to take his eyes.  He should take more in his eyes.  And my mom made a move to say something.  Now, hold on.  And I said, Mom, stop it.  You're not going to win this battle.  Yeah, yes.  And I had my hat on really low.  So people wouldn't...  Serious.  I was going to say that you probably didn't get recognized at all because that audience  thinks all white people look alike anyway.  So it's just...  They can't tell a difference.  They didn't want to assume.  Yeah.  Why do black people always scream at white people not to go in the bushes, not to go 
[03:49:30]  in the back, not to go in the darkness?  It's their maternal instinct.  Why is it?  But it's a great way to watch a horror movie.  Not for everybody else around you.  No, but it's very participative.  You feel like a participant.  That's like the only time a white person gets called the N-word.  Look at this stupid nigga going in the back.  Get out of there, yo.  That's true.  You know what?  I went to see...  I still can't say it.  Even in a horror movie.  I went to see Day After Tomorrow.  Yeah.  The Jake Gyllenhaal movie.  There was like the vice president or the president. 
[03:50:00]  I don't know.  He was supposed to look just like Dick Cheney.  Yeah.  And I guess he was making all the wrong calls because the world was coming...  Was it Richard Dreyfuss?  I don't...  It could have been.  It could have been.  Yeah.  It could have easily been.  Is he still alive?  Oh, shit.  But, yeah, he is.  Yes, he's still alive.  Who did?  Who did just found out last week Johnny Carson died?  He's been having a rough one.  I'm sorry.  Let's move it along.  But, I was sitting there in the theater watching this movie and it's dramatic and it's snowing  and raining and all this stuff and the vice president comes on TV again and he tells everybody 
[03:50:30]  to stay put and the biggest laugh I ever heard in a theater did not come from a movie.  It came from one guy sitting in the crowd that just yelled at the Dick Cheney character,  Yo, who voted for this nigger?  That's amazing.  It was the most welcome audience participation I've ever heard.  Tim Olyphant, when we were doing Die Hard, he told me the funny story about seeing the original Die Hard. 
[03:51:00]  This is from Tim Olyphant.  I can't take credit for this.  He went to the original Die Hard and I don't know if you remember the movie, but it takes  a little while for shit to happen, for this stuff to start to unravel.  There's the whole setup where he goes to the towers.  It's just kind of a, it takes like 20 minutes to get started the action.  It was a full theater.  I think it was like opening night, opening day of the movie.  And like 15 minutes in, this guy just stood up, collected his stuff, stood up, and yelled 
[03:51:30]  at the screen.  He goes, No action!  And walked out.  And walked out.  And the funny thing is, Tim and I were talking about it, like, that guy was so mad, so mad  that there wasn't action in this movie, so as to like, that prompted him to scream at  it.  Exclaim.  Exclaim this, like, and which meant that he must have been a huge action movie fan.  Yeah.  And so, I'm sure he's subsequently seen Die Hard and now knows that it arguably is like  the best action movie ever made. 
[03:52:00]  So I wonder what action, no act, couldn't be patient, couldn't wait another three minutes  for like, the greatest action to start.  Well now, Justin Long, you are not just an actor, but a writer.  Thank you.  You've written a film.  Well, no, I shouldn't, I don't know, that wasn't a compliment, I guess.  Anybody could be a writer.  Thank you.  That is true.  I receive screenwriting credit.  So I never know what to say to people when they're like, oh man, you were in, uh, weren't  you in that?  And then they say like, you were in something and there's just like an awkward plan.  I go, yes.  And then I always feel, yeah. 
[03:52:30]  Like, oh, I should be thanking them.  Oh, doucheball.  Oh, he was in dodgeball.  Oh, I just said yes.  I don't know.  But what I, I wanted to know, now that you're writing this film.  Thank you.  If you go, if you go to a theater and you hear people shouting over your dialogue that  you've written, you can, oh, shut the fuck up.  This is brilliant.  Right.  Uh, you know, what's funny?  I, I saw it at, it was at Tribeca Film Festival and, uh, and, and this, there was something  off with the sound. 
[03:53:00]  I don't know why there's, the sound was kind of loud and it was driving me nuts because  I, I got really arrogant about, you know, I wanted people, you also want people to see  something.  I'm very close to the movie and I feel like a, you know, personal connection.  So I, I wanted it to play as well as possible and people were kind, I could see them like  straining to hear some of the stuff.  And when stuff you wrote, not, not just jokes, but like just the story, you know,  um, some of it was kind of lower.  It's a romantic, like a romantic comedy.  So, uh, it's called A Case of You.  A Case of You.  Yeah.  It's, as you know, based on the Joni Mitchell.  Mmm. 
[03:53:30]  Stop.  Yeah.  As you know, Joni Mitchell, right?  Huge Joni Mitchell.  And I'm assuming, uh, yeah.  But, uh, yeah, so we, um, and, and sadly could not get the rights to the song.  The song's not in the film.  Oh, seriously?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm sorry, who kid?  Now, could you not afford the rights to the song?  We couldn't afford it.  Wow.  We couldn't afford it.  It was expensive.  Joni wouldn't cut your deal?  Like, look, I named the movie after the song.  That's crazy.  Yeah, you know, when I wrote her a letter, not that I, a letter from me would be that. 
[03:54:00]  I am Justin Long from Jeepers Creepers.  Have you seen Herbie Fully Loaded?  What?  Or Jeepers Creepers 1 and 2.  I was coming down the hill.  I lived on a street off of Briarcliff and there was this guy, um, uh, not a white guy,  came, coming down and he goes, and he stopped us.  We know what that means.  You know, Bangladeshi.  And he, and he, and he stopped us, uh, I was with my friend, Harmar, shout out to Harmar  Superstar.  And, uh, and he goes, uh, he goes, hey man, hey, I just want to know, um, I'm looking for  a street called, uh, and we were on a street called Briarcliff and he goes, a street called, 
[03:54:30]  uh, I'm looking for like, uh, Brearcliff?  And we go, oh, you probably mean Briarcliff.  You're on it.  This is Briarcliff.  And he goes, no, no, no.  It's like, um, it's like tire, what is it?  Like tire lift or tire.  We go, I think it's probably Briarcliff and you're on it.  And this went back and forth like three or four times and he was getting frustrated.  He was like, no, no, no, man.  And he stopped and he looked at me and he goes, oh shit, I know who you are.  And I was like, oh yeah.  He goes, I've seen both your movies. 
[03:55:00]  And my friend whispered to me, he goes, Jeepers Creepers 1 and Jeepers Creepers 2.  I go, shut up.  I go, what?  I was like, what, what, what movies?  He goes, ah, quit playing, man.  Shut up.  I know you both, both of them.  And I was like, well, which ones?  He had enough trouble with the street names.  And sure enough, he, like, he was like, he was like, you know, man.  And he goes, well, which one?  He goes, Jeepers Creepers 1 and Jeepers Creepers 2.  Of course.  Classic.  Classic.  Um, but yeah, back to Joni Mitchell.  Yes.  Oh, man.  So I wrote it with my brother and my friend here. 
[03:55:30]  We got a lot of, uh, we got Evan Rachel Wood to play the lead girl.  You have a huge cast.  Huge cast.  Vince Vaughn, Sam Rockwell.  Oh, shit.  Illuminati, God.  Brendan Fraser pops up.  Brendan Fraser.  Yeah.  Illuminati?  Vaughn.  Oh, Vaughn.  Vince Vaughn is in the Illuminati.  He is, B.  He is.  Why do you say that?  He be hanging with, you know, my boy.  Who's your boy?  No, my boy.  Henry Kissinger?  Kissinger.  It's funny he knows, though.  He just said Jay-Z.  Oh, no kidding.  Maybe Jay-Z be having caramel macchiato at Starbucks. 
[03:56:00]  I guess if any, if you're going to figure out that somebody's in the Illuminati, that's  the way to do it.  It's the pumpkin spice latte.  They speed shit.  Like, whoever drinks it, they run and they shit quick.  Okay.  And that gets, is there an Illuminati restroom or?  They must have a gold toilet.  No shit like that, man.  Okay.  Well, I noticed him on your phone, Jay-Z.  Yeah.  That's cool.  That's my boy.  Yeah.  He wants his number?  You can call him and prank him.  I mean, I want to say yes, but I have too much respect.  Right.  It's something like, Justin and I both know you shouldn't have offered that. 
[03:56:30]  So, our instinct is to say no.  I'm not even friends with him, and I feel like I'm more protective than you are.  Right.  That's a bad idea.  When you touch Mr. V, did he glow?  Like, I heard when you touch him, he just glowed.  You're talking about Vince Vaughn.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Does he glow?  We call him Mr. V in the hood.  Okay.  That's so nice to say that.  Did he glow?  Like, when you touch him, he just glowed.  Glow?  Is that a...  When you touch him and he...  I think he means literally.  Do you mean he got like a boner?  No, like he glows.  Like, he's like a light bug.  Like, literally glows.  No, you know, I'm going to debunk that myth. 
[03:57:00]  I'm sorry.  I hate to do that.  Snopes, I hope you're listening.  Sorry.  Sorry.  I'm mad right now.  Only because I don't want that out there.  But yes, of course he glows.  So, where can people see a case of you?  It's out on DirecTV on demand right now.  If they want to...  I don't know.  What's the deal with that?  You can just watch it at home.  Or it's in theaters in a couple weeks on November 8th.  Are you doing the limited release iTunes?  Yes.  That track?  That track.  And as well as a movie called Best Man Down.  Right.  That's the other...  But you didn't write that one.  So you're not quite as attached. 
[03:57:30]  I'm not quite as attached.  But I'm happy about it.  Another rom-com?  It is, but it's got kind of a morbid twist.  It's about a couple that on their wedding day, their best man dies in the beginning of the movie.  And we have to...  Oh, shit.  Black Hawk Down.  Well, yes, it is not unlike Black Hawk Down.  It's not in Africa.  It's called Best Man Down.  It's called Best Man Down.  It was out on that Mogadishu stuff.  Yeah.  Josh Hartnett is not in it.  That's a shame.  Yes. 
[03:58:00]  Very handsome.  Fucked up.  Good.  But he's very handsome.  He is.  I'm glad you were the one to say that.  Yeah.  Hey, I've noticed people saying that.  Who, kid?  I'm glad you brought that up.  No homo, they say.  Yeah.  Which I think is kind of homophobic.  It's quite homophobic.  Yeah.  No, but it's supposed to be like the balance, like the neutrality of like, if you see like  a gay guy, no homophobic.  Well, you know what I like doing?  But it's cool.  It's still cool.  We like gay guys, but...  But no homophobic.  But you don't want to insert yourself in.  We just want to make sure our booties look about tough.  Well, because I've noticed guys saying that to a few, like, I've noticed, like, a couple 
[03:58:30]  weeks ago at a gas station, I stopped, and this kind of fratty guy was like, hey, man,  can I get a picture with you?  And I was like, yeah, we took a picture.  And he goes, I'm just like a big fan.  I wanted a picture.  He goes, no homo.  And I said, what was the last thing you said?  And he explained it to me.  And since then, I've been hearing it more.  And I said, when he said no homo, and I went, oh, no homo?  And he got kind of weird about it.  And so I want to start saying that when people say no homo, I want to say... 
[03:59:00]  It's like a cool way.  I mean, you know.  Can you say, if you are gay, can you say, hey, can I, nice to meet you, plenty of homo?  I don't know about the plenty, but...  Like, if you're flirting with somebody, and you want to make it clear.  It's really nice to meet you, Justin.  Homo.  All homo intended.  Who can...  You look great today.  Homo.  Or if it's like...  Or if it's just you have a curiosity.  It's like, who can...  You look great.  A homo-ish.  Yeah. 
[03:59:30]  Homo?  We're all homo now, so it's cool.  Is that right?  That's what I heard.  The scientist told me yesterday.  That's good to know.  Well, last week.  Yeah, the continuum theory.  Is that like the Kinsey thing?  Like the Kinsey scale?  We're all going to be homo in like 30 years.  Everybody.  Wow.  Is that like...  So how will we reproduce?  There's an extra bone growing in the back of your ass.  Whatever, man.  I think you might be starting to lose the science.  I want to get into this now.  I hate that I've been plugging my movie for so long. 
[04:00:00]  Yeah.  Because they did just discover, you know, they did research on this fossil in the Republic  of Georgia.  And so they've discovered that when they once thought that Homo erectus was a separate species  from a lot of the hominids that were found in Africa.  And they're now...  They're not thinking they were all the same.  They just looked a lot different.  So it's rewriting like everything they thought about evolution, which is interesting and  hilarious.  Yeah.  And it's worth talking about.  And that's what you're saying.  Homo erectum.  Is that what they were talking about?  The extra bone in the ass?  They didn't get into that. 
[04:00:30]  Oh, no.  Was that Homo erectum?  It must have been one of...  I think...  Who could watch a lot of TED talks?  I don't know exactly where he picked up on that information.  But listen, we have to release you to the next show.  Ah, this is fun.  And we have to leave.  Homo.  Justin Long.  I've got to release you.  No homo.  I have to release.  It's been a homo this whole time.  Best Man Down and A Case of You.  Definitely make it a point to watch both movies on demand and iTunes and limited release  and search amount. 
[04:01:00]  All the black people will watch it.  I have to ask you a favor.  Why are you being sarcastic about that?  No, I'm serious.  All the black people love you.  Just call it Cheaper Screepers 3.  Cheaper Screepers 3.  Yeah.  I have to ask you, though.  I'm a big fan, too.  Do me a favor.  However, you've got the morning mashup coming up next.  Yeah.  So, when they...  And they are going to ask you about Amanda Seyfried.  Okay.  When they do, just say, no homo.  And just see...  And leave it at that?  Leave it at that.  I'll bet they can get a quote out of it.  Everybody will be happy.  But then that means they have to...  Because it'll be like a soundbite they'd want to use. 
[04:01:30]  That means they have to use that.  Exactly.  They just have to say...  And somebody over there goes...  Justin Long was up at the morning mashup talking about there's a relationship with Amanda  Seyfried.  No homo.  Somebody does have a big pussy on that show.  That's Nicole.  You'll meet her soon.  Yeah.  Literally?  Big pussy.  I can't wait to get into it.  You have fun with Nicole.  No homo.  And congratulations on the movies.  Thank you.  Thank you, guys.  Come back again soon.  You're a very funny guy.  I'd love to.  This is awesome.  A lot of fun.  And we'll see you again soon.
