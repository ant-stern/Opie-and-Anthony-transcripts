<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opens with an evaluation of Ricky, a potentially-hired intern.  His lack of confidence and underwhelming performance, particularly during a frustrating bagel and coffee errand run and a poorly-handled impromptu interview (which is played for the audience), are highlighted.  He's assigned a presentation on sarcasm for the next show.  The conversation then veers sharply into listener calls detailing their early exposure to pornography, focusing on humorous anecdotes involving *Playboy*, *Hustler*, and other adult magazines. This segues into a review of unsolicited instructional sex DVDs received by the show, featuring graphic descriptions of the content and humorous, crude commentary from Opie and Anthony.  Attempts to play one of the DVDs on a PlayStation are thwarted by technical difficulties.

The show continues with another failed attempt to review sex-education DVDs from the Sinclair Intimacy Institute, featuring graphic depictions of sexual acts, accompanied by disgusted and crude commentary from the hosts and Steve, the sound technician.  Technical difficulties with the equipment become a running gag. This is followed by a comedic bit where Anthony impersonates a stereotypical old-timey radio DJ on a fictional CBS station, delivering sexually explicit jokes and playing music in response to a previous joke made by the actual CBS station at Opie and Anthony’s expense. A caller expresses disapproval.  The show briefly mentions Princess Diana's funeral and a Hurricane Katrina relief PSA, before concluding this section with an offensive segment about a supposed explicit "freak dance" at a high school.

Next, a humorous video of a man falling into water after firefighters pull down his pants is shown, leading into a discussion about Freaknik in Atlanta,  with graphic descriptions of chaotic scenes, including explicit sexual acts in public. The hosts detail their own unsettling experiences at Freaknik, contrasting their reactions to those of people in other neighborhoods.  Similar chaotic and racially-charged anecdotes involving Six Flags Great Adventure and listener calls follow.  A phone interview with a supposedly “osteopathic physician,” “Dr. Smith,” promoting "Golden Mood," ensues, marked by awkwardness, strange responses, and increasingly hostile and inappropriate questioning from the hosts, eventually revealed to be a joke.  The segment concludes with a comical argument between Derek and Eric, staff members, about Eric's audio file organization, highlighting the chaotic behind-the-scenes environment.  The hosts then promote "Golden Mood" and tease an upcoming segment with the Iron Sheik.

The show then searches for a missing Sue Johansson CD, highlighting Opie's extensive CD collection and the studio's disorganization.  Outtakes from Siskel and Ebert promotional recordings are played, revealing their behind-the-scenes animosity.  Tiana, a 19-year-old model, is a guest in studio.  The hosts and Jim Norton (a caller) engage in sexually explicit commentary comparing her online photos to her in-person appearance, discussing her modeling work and a past sexual encounter at age 14.  "Uncle Icky" or "Inky," a photographer, is also mentioned.  The conversation continues, comparing Tiana's appearance in person to her online photos, with differing opinions between the hosts and the caller.

The final segment begins with an anecdote about a host’s ill-fated Calvin Klein underwear modeling attempt.  It then focuses on “Psycho Mark,” a former employee, and his appearance on Fox News following the hosts' firing for broadcasting a sex act from St. Patrick's Cathedral during their "Sex for Sam" contest.  Audio from Psycho Mark's interview is played, highlighting his nervous, formal demeanor contrasting with his usual behavior.  The hosts discuss his past antics, including an incident with an offensive sign and attempting to hide marijuana.  The segment includes brief ads for Ron & Fez and a G4 games review by Adam Sessler and Morgan Webb, a Laszlo segment about unauthorized wireless internet access, and a brief call from Stephen Lynch.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  true anthony needs a number three yeah i don't even ask him to get me food no i'm just thinking  if you have to screw something up that's pretty much it is the food thing and because it really  doesn't have anything to do with radio and what you're learning you know as far as what you're  going to need to know in radio it's pretty much things you pick up just being around the the vibe  of a show you know and how do you think that's going um you mean like uh picking up on all these 
[00:00:30]  things and noticing all the uh interacting with the guys in the glass booth over there that you know  the the unseen heroes that keep the opian anthony show going things like that are you are you  learning from them yeah of course i mean i've learned i've seen how they um they work behind  the scenes they're busting their asses do you feel you'd be able if one of them were out one day to  slip in and and do their job um i would hope  do you feel comfortable here yeah 
[00:01:00]  um because i don't know ricky i don't know if radio is really for you  i just don't know it's one of those things i don't know i i've heard your tape and and again  it's not you can't make a decision based on one air check and perhaps you'll grow as an air 
[00:01:30]  personality but based on that your your delivery of something i believe to be successful in radio  aside from just learning stuff you need some type of natural spark yeah something in your personality  that regardless of everything you can learn uh you need something that is almost in you for life  you know yeah like a sense of humor maybe uh some insight um maybe a radio voice a radio voice too 
[00:02:00]  yeah you could have nothing upstairs and if you have that radio voice to intro records that's all you  need read the liners things like that um what do you see as maybe a talent some kind of natural  talent that you can't teach somebody that you have that would put you ahead of others in radio  honestly i really don't see anything  did you see that jerk 
[00:02:30]  he sees nothing you don't have you see nothing in yourself  yeah i'm a very uh negative person so you're very negative you better not be negative around opie  yeah i know negative out of his life all right you'll be the first one to go really wow because  i'm thinking ricky do you have a plan b is there a plan b for you just in case any of this doesn't 
[00:03:00]  work out do you have do you know a trade a trade skill perhaps a plumber's assistant  i really don't have a plan b to be honest no no plan b radio or nothing a warm bath and some razor blades  because i don't know i'm just not seeing it gelling with you yeah i see it there's this kind of come  on man it's his dream stop just see i understand his dream i i see a complete lack of confidence on 
[00:03:30]  your part you're not a very confident person in yourself well derek from alabama is saying that  ricky has a voice for npr radio well maybe you could do some npr stuff there you go do you think  you'd be able to maybe give the issues a a spin based on you know your own take on it i guess i can  yeah yeah might have to have him do that oh maybe that's his thing well he uh he's good at improvising 
[00:04:00]  i remember when bruce kelly was doing those interviews while we're on on vacation you know  they were asking all the all the people that are associated with us to give some words on right on  us and we heard how horrible every one of those were yeah frenchy the chef telling his hours that  he wakes up and goes to work that's how bad and they decided that yours weren't good enough to make  that cut there was a moment where it's like all right here's the time to shine i can improv something  a little i'm going to show these guys that i got a little something i gotta defend uh bruce kelly now 
[00:04:30]  wow really really do he didn't have much to work with because he he we ended up playing the ones that  that he thought were good there were a whole bunch of interviews he did with some of the people that  just never made the cut one was with ricky was with ricky which i think we should play right now  you want to listen in on this let's give a little listen to the one that didn't make it  all right maybe ricky can tell us what went wrong uh with this ricky is one of the behind the scene 
[00:05:00]  members of the ona virus on xm202 high voltage ricky what's your job i intern for the opian anthony  show i basically uh do the things behind the scenes i get them food i get them coffee i also do some  paperwork with master poe and i also uh get feedback for the guys what's the weirdest thing you've had to  do for ona oh weirdest um nothing particularly weird at all i mean the only thing they did was do  a runaround on me which was you know they told me to get food over and over and over again but  like one of the foods oh the nervous gulp like like like they would they would say that i screwed up 
[00:05:30]  the order somehow like i got them a bagel with cream cheese and he goes and i give it to jim and  jim's like no see this is toasted nobody likes a toasted bagel so then he tosses it to the side and  then he's like you know give me a regular bagel but from a certain deli so i had to go two blocks  like down away from like the station and try to get the bagel and keep going over and over and over  for coffee for bagels for over and over again how did you become a member of the ona virus i just gave 
[00:06:00]  my resume into uh ben ben ben sparks the executive producer ben sparks the executive producer ben sparks  ben sparks executive producer  see that was ben must have been tired  i gotta be honest with you man ben does a great job but i think that day when you had it in your  resume ben must have been tired  well um i mean let's be honest i think he was just like yeah all right 
[00:06:30]  eeny meeny miny moe i think that's those are the words that started the selection ben was on a  bender or something said ah yeah what the hell i didn't want to say this the the actual story  why how i got his uh card or whatever but like mainly is it as exciting as the bagel story you told  uh no i just helped out during the howard stern rally that was all yeah with huge signs i was with  megan along the line with uh when howard was leaving at the limo i was like right there with  megan with a huge sign right in his face and at the letterman show with a few other guys as well 
[00:07:00]  from whack bags yes ben well ricky you know look at him he's like he's not all there but he's a good  kid at the end of the day he tries you know he did he did a great job the day from the executive  producer i like that's that's a great review he's not all there but he tries he's he he does so i mean  at the end of the day ricky tries and he's done a good job at the end of the day ricky tries that's  something you say to the guy that comes in third in the special olympics well yeah well at the end 
[00:07:30]  of the day ricky does try how long did it take you to find the advertising uh the full page ad for  open anthony the other day uh that took me on the last hour all the way to uh 12 the last hour of the  show yeah so from 10 a.m to 12 to 12 two hours you were looking through newspapers to find the  the full page uh open anthony ad yeah and then that ben told you to look for yeah who thinks  you're a good guy he's a good guy you're just a great guy yourself at the end of the day at the  end of the day yeah it took you two hours going through newspapers to find one full page ad i ended 
[00:08:00]  up not finding it anyway and other guys just tell me just forget about it you know so you didn't find  it anyway after two hours yeah but he tried ben he tried he tries that's good anywhere along the two  hours did you think that maybe someone was fucking with you yeah but then i said well maybe they're  not but might as well keep doing it anyway wouldn't you at some point maybe go up and go guys are you  fucking with me i i i mainly don't do it if it is and or in your inimitable style guys are you 
[00:08:30]  fucking with me guys don't fuck all right you you need a little more um gumption i guess the only  word i could come up with i don't know it well you know you can stay uh with the show as long as you  want you know you're welcome to you know uh we'll we'll buy you lunch every once in a while that'll be  cool kick around sure yeah we're not gonna kick you out the door but as far as uh making this uh 
[00:09:00]  a career with us do you think is there a a a goal where like some of the people here perhaps  you'll be taken on board and and be a paid employee of the opium anthony show i don't foresee that to  be honest with you you don't yeah yeah dude you gotta be you know i know this is a bit but you gotta  be more positive with yourself a little more just a little more i can't do this to the kid you gotta  be positive though dude you can't say that you never know nathaniel yes well i have one concern 
[00:09:30]  with ricky which is there's a lot of sarcasm on this show and i was concerned because the other  day i was uh they were moving some stuff around the office and i was sitting at steve's computer  doing some stuff and i was surrounded by chairs and i said can i get one more chair around me please  and ricky honestly goes over to the couch stop it and starts pushing the couch towards me  oh my god you're kidding with no sense of irony at all uh ricky when are you in here next i'm in 
[00:10:00]  here wednesday that is the funniest god damn thing i've ever heard can i get one more chair  you didn't see the sarcasm there uh no i i just i just heard the statement i said all right get  another oh okay all right here ricky you're gonna be back wednesday yeah all right i think  technically we're his bosses for this internship i think at the end of the internship we actually 
[00:10:30]  have to write a review for a little review yeah all right we're gonna give you a little assignment  we want you to to do a a slight a small presentation on sarcasm for wednesday show  you mean a verbal presentation or um yeah verbal no use hand puppets to explore your feelings on  sarcasm it's radio of course you get to know now he's nathaniel's going watch he's going to come  in now with hand puppets you got the next he doesn't understand you got the next two days to come up 
[00:11:00]  with a uh relatively short presentation on sarcasm uh how short that you could present to anthony and  i live on the show okay all right how short just uh you know what is sarcasm maybe some examples of  sarcasm things like that how long would you say this should be uh you know like a five minute  presentation five minute presentation okay all right now now that thing you did with um with  uh asshole for the uh uh bruce bruce kelly oh bruce i'm sorry yeah uh you did for him didn't you 
[00:11:30]  why are you calling him an asshole i don't know pain in the ass then not asshole pain in the ass  because he has a pain in the ass the thing you did with him did you did you know when it was going on  that it was really dull yeah now when he asked you what's the you know the strangest thing you did  you should have said well you know didn't it come to mind maybe think of before i was an intern i came  in it with cherry darts and you could describe cherry darts and how crazy that was and stuff  didn't you think that might have made a better story than going out to get a bagel and getting 
[00:12:00]  lost and i didn't think of it at the time no yeah well that's the whole thing of spontaneity and yeah  thinking on your feet like that and it's part of part of radio you want to uh go back to the bruce  kelly thing a couple more minutes here oh there was more oh yeah hit that uh why did you become a  member of the ona virus um just to be part of the show i mean you know it's also for college credit i  i'm getting credit for this as well but you know it's also for the fun i mean i'm a fan of this  show i love this show and uh you know it's it's been fun so far first thing that comes to your mind 
[00:12:30]  when i say opie and anthony talk go amazing they're phenomenal like like you can't get any  better than them than that now like there's a lot of other shows out there but nothing can match opie  and anthony for now for now what's the difference between ona on what do you mean for now  well um till ricky gets on the air no no you understand there's never gonna be anyone better  than us no i mean if like until like the show actually like ends and go off goes off the air

[00:20:00]  colorado eric what's up with uh debbie gibson yeah yeah that that whole uh celebrity thing  posing nude is getting old and i'll tell you why it's getting old but i'll tell you why she's  fucking odd yeah but she doesn't show anything she doesn't she doesn't from the weather she  doesn't show there's no peaver shots do you see snatch no you don't see snatch none at all no hair 
[00:20:30]  no she has this like uh she has like this uh what was it a necklace or a belt that  the one shot she's holding the hat over and the other one uh i think it's like a belt or something  she's covering with yeah it's some kind of wacky necklace or belt that just happens to cover the  area perfectly clever ways to hide it even still i'll tell you what i would compare her pictures  to those of uh tiffany that came out last year her pictures are a lot better remember the big 
[00:21:00]  debbie gibson tiffany fight of the uh 80s and then and then uh the joke was you know which one's  going to end up in playboy first and uh and tiffany is when tiffany posed debbie gibson said she  would never do it oh really she did say that they all say they'll never do it the trick is you got  to do it when you're hot when when uh the people want to see you if if tiffany and debbie gibson did  some kind of a dyke thing in swank magazine in 1985 you know maybe then well i agree with you 
[00:21:30]  because uh i was looking at the debbie gibson spread and yeah she's really hot and stuff but it  just annoys me because you know playboy gets these has-been uh singers and actresses and they get  him to pose by saying look we'll we'll do uh very artistic photos and and they'll be more of an  art thing than than you know porno playboy stinks i mean debbie gibson she's i mean she's not really  a has-been she's been big on broadway still man so what like so is nathan lane you want to see him  naked playboy blows dude like i said a has-been trust me she'd rather be selling you know uh 
[00:22:00]  uh hit albums i mean you really want to see every time you hear one of those songs though  you're gonna spring wood now all right thank you bro later he's chatty they have this this phony  sense of like legitimacy because they don't show hardcore that's what i mean and that's what's  driving me it stinks if they're if they're not showing pink then they're not really posing for  any of these magazines but they think that's classy classy hustler is is what a mag hustler's honest  about the agenda this is what i'm looking at it for i want to play a gynecological an exam magazine 
[00:22:30]  you're right filthy you're right playboy fills the gap between uh people that can have that in  their house and the poor sons of bitches that are pussy whipped by their wives that can't have  porno in the house but for some reason they've been able to talk their wives into uh letting them  get playboy because that's not really porno there are articles in it interviews with politicians  things like that and then the occasional naked girl without uh you know hubba bubba hanging between  her so you know it serves its purpose and for first timers you know you're a kid you get your 
[00:23:00]  hand on a playboy that might as well be hardcore pornography anthony not anymore though not anymore  not anymore and i mean you know you make some good points but i mean jim makes a good point about the  honesty issue you know i mean she's still she's still showing her whore side i mean who's she kidding  yeah not if you ask her keeps that private so no one can see it that's what i want to see  that's the only thing i'm interested they could cut the head off i don't need to see the head it's  given me such freedom the reason i did this was i don't know it's an outlet uh it's just a freeing 
[00:23:30]  experience from shut up the paycheck that's why she did it yeah because she you know wants her name in  the in the press again all these people that uh that do this they do it for the check and the  publicity it's just an yeah it's just an avenue to get your name back up on top for a little while  there you go and then maybe someone will pay attention to her latest song or maybe give her  some kind of role in a movie that's all you know but to act like it's artistic and stuff no you're 
[00:24:00]  showing desperation and you're you know you want people to start talking about you again right  but to sit there i i watched her on all these shows yeah the the shows were the shows the shots were  done in an artistic fashion yes they were they're very classy look at this one you know yes i'm  dressed in orange cloth saffron it's art i swear so you're right about the honesty issue you know  if you're gonna do it you should just do it yeah we'll see um in the future i guess like christina 
[00:24:30]  aguilera things like that britney you think britney will uh of course spread them for playboy  out of doubt she might even go to hustler i think britney does it before she uh you know starts the  down the downward spiral downward she's already pretty much the has-been isn't she i don't know  about that every day there's a picture in the paper yeah but as far do now that short haircut  yeah it stinks yeah no she wore that for a day she's such trash i love it she wigged out 
[00:25:00]  yeah remember she yeah we were talking about that last week she wigged out for a day but that she  threw the wig on just so she could go out yeah but i'm not saying she's she's not still huge in  the news and stuff but as far as a singing career goes how relevant is she these days well she threw  the greatest hits uh package out greatest hits that's pretty much uh that's all i had people  that's all i had now here's the greatest hits of it and i'm done you go greatest hits then you go  live album or do you go live album first and then greatest hits i think live first live first usually 
[00:25:30]  and then greatest hits yeah because you might need some of the live cuts greatest hits with that  one song that wrecks the greatest hits album the one no one cares about because it's new it's always  in the last position because even the artist knows it's crap and no one wants to hear it it's some like  just name some stupid band uh like stick sticks greatest hits it's like one after another you know  all these songs and then this last freaking song they're hoping you're gonna like something new  that sounds like the old stuff with updated lyrics they're talking about like that's that's what you 
[00:26:00]  want to hear a band like yes right puts out a greatest hits or something and and they write a  new song and it's about like the internet it's like and it sounds just like a song that came out in  1975 but you know it's about uh computers and you know the new stuff and the iraq war yeah this blows  shut up really just awful whining let's say hi to ted hey ted hey guys how you doing good man  hello jimmy awesome show friday night oh thank you ted thank you for attending hey i was uh i was

[00:32:00]  the first thing i was exposed to of all porn i was like eight my brother was like a twisted ass freak  kids are usually like playboys and hustlers he had puritan do you remember that porn sure do yeah  puritan was like the hardcore ass fucking porn and my brother had like like a huge like  fucking pile of puritans and one time i rubbed one out and my i left one out i guess and i went 
[00:32:30]  downstairs and my mom's this little old german lady right and um i i she she i guess she found it  she's like uh hey found something in your room and i'm like oh shit and she goes that's a hardcore  porn so she started like freaking out and she just i'm punching out peace  he didn't even let me get to the crash the best part was we all just started looking at each other  like what what what what's going on here i'm hitting buttons cheering up for the crash i'm just waiting 
[00:33:00]  for him to stop and hit the crash and he punched out he could sense that you were looking for what  are those white things called the template that he knew you were looking too because it was so quiet  he could hear the shuffle of the papers see that's a punch out you can't punch out when you're done  some people get the crash and they go all right i'm punching out it's too late you're a ditch in the  ground mike from jersey hey guys how you doing good okay i got a good story uh down the road from my  house when we were kids there was a a piece of road there people used to flip stuff out the window  all the time so occasionally you'd find a uh a magazine on the side of the road but there's 
[00:33:30]  one day in particular that we were riding our bikes down the road a friend of mine  and i and we saw a magazine over on the side it was probably about a football field away so we both  raced as fast as we could to see who could get it first we both got it at the same time we wound up  getting an old fight over who's going to get to look at the magazine first it was kind of funny  you could rip it in half hold on and trade it was pretty funny it was actually cherry magazine i don't  think i remember that one certainly do yeah however that wasn't funny just to clarify it 
[00:34:00]  wasn't funny at all let you know that wasn't really a funny story but it was interesting  i don't crash me no it wasn't bad no it was good uh west virginia checking in it's john hey john  hey what's going on guys what's up john hi jimmy you beefy tits hi john let's not be insulting  now it's valentine's day hey i was eight years old my dad introduced me to the two best pornos  porkies and roadhouse i'm punching out porkies and roadhouse you know what uh what magazine stunk 
[00:34:30]  easy rider that trash laying around what the hell was easy rider again was that biker magazine but it  had naked chicks in it too but they were the skankiest biker whores that you'd ever ever see  and uh it was it was like that i mean if you're jacking it to the sears catalog bra section you  know it might be good because uh it's probably a little better than that to jack to but just those  awful biker chicks very did you start with like selective national geographic though no always playboy 
[00:35:00]  started with playboy but you couldn't just get your hands on that when you were really little  let me think national geographic might have you know you might be right i mean you graduate up to  the porn magazines you know because uh the national geographic you start realizing that they're just  awful naked women in there yeah well it was you know the africa at first it was it was just the oh my  god naked women then you then you have to go you know uh you know you're jonesing for more and more  and then you eventually get up to the the real porn magazines but you have to start somewhere 
[00:35:30]  national geographic it was national geographic the uh going through the dictionaries and stuff and i  don't know just finding oh you'd have to find wherever you could wherever you could a dictionary  well that's a bad example but whatever medical books yes you know any type of books that the  parents had around the house you're leafing through hoping to you know catch a glimpse of  something you find a medical book and like thumb through it and find a picture of a woman with her  eyes covered over with the black strip so you can't tell who she is kind of a thing and you know 
[00:36:00]  it's it's it's a whole thing on psoriasis or something so she's naked with psoriasis but she's naked  that's exactly what i'm getting at yeah i know exactly what you're talking about yeah and then  you eventually find whatever you could yeah then eventually you start figuring out how to get your  uh porn magazines like thalidomide woman she's got little flipper arms but but she's naked you know  how i got my first uh porn magazines i had a paper route yeah and i i noticed that uh you know people  would like just leave a you know their paper and their magazines bundle up for the garbage man 
[00:36:30]  and you know you look at through the stacks of that long enough you'll find you'll find a porn  magazine yeah they put them in the middle of the stack you know it took some doing and you would  have to spend maybe a whole afternoon literally going from house to house you know i had scissors  and everything just you know you know uh cutting the the rope that was tied around it and every once  in a while i'd hit pay dirt kids just do not understand how lucky they are today with uh with the  internet it is amazing i i mean years ago you did you had to it was like a treasure hunt you were

[01:03:00]  trusting and agreed to erotic play which has its own script and results in mutual pleasure listen to  this guy as rape is violence the fantasy being forced to have an erotic experience many women who  talk about these fantasies are not talking about rape but an erotic confrontation this is morally  permitted because they are being overpowered and are absolved from any responsibility another  element of this fantasy is anti-sexy experience being swept away wrinkled mouth like an asshole moving 
[01:03:30]  she does have like a some of the sex games played among trusting comfortable couples it involves tying  up your partner or being tied up yourself oh is this tony dow looking guy can give you the freedom to  totally submit to stimulation provided by your partner him and his rayliotta hair really make me  sick make sure you don't do anything that you normally wouldn't do you could lose the trust of your  partner if you go too far right before any knots are tied pick a word that could be used by the person  who is tied up to end the game stop a safe word make sure it's not a word that you would normally use so 
[01:04:00]  that it doesn't get used by accident don't use words like stop or no because that would deprive you of  begging for freedom when you actually didn't need it it's fun to beg for mercy when it's just a game  and you don't want to be taken seriously of course the key word should be used when you actually want  to stop colon cancer you're both having a good time otherwise someone could get hurt or embarrassed  tie-up games or bondage only work when couples feel better afterwards than they did before 
[01:04:30]  here we go it's over jenny wait here we go oh ominous ew look at her hairy head  guys tied up spread eagle on the bed and his soft junk is gently laying to the left  what was this what was what was this film 1979 look at that mop in her lap oh more important than the  kind of restraints you use is the idea of letting yourself be helpless punch him in the balls  you might be able to break the restraints if you try don't try for many people being tied up is the 
[01:05:00]  only time that they totally lay back and receive pleasure and she's just tickling him that stinks  what is she doing she's rubbing his arm use his mouth as a toilet god almighty what's wrong with  these people uh-oh oh she's rubbing her flappy tit on his jumps this is awful this is horrible is she  gonna pop it into her mouth at least oh ow don't twist it what did she do to his yam bag it's not a

[01:08:00]  I liked her body when it was in the shining in a bathtub.  This stinks.  This is the worst.  Look at her bunt.  She's just awful.  All right, well, that's it.  He has a forehead and hair like Ben, though.  Wait till you see how sweaty he is.  He's just laying in bed.  He still has nothing going on, man.  No, he's back and a half.  There's nothing going on.  Why do you think he's got nothing going on?  She's working like crazy and just nothing is happening.  What does she shave her vagina with?  Miracle growth.  Jesus. 
[01:08:30]  Now she's jacking him.  She's grabbing the base with one hand and jacking him with the other.  To make it look hard.  She's squeezing it.  Yeah.  It's an old porno trick.  Yeah.  Look at his Ben hair.  Oh, boy.  They're going in for the 69.  69.  Boys and girls.  Oh, this poor guy.  Oh, well.  Jesus.  In that position right now,  she should be dropping something that looks like a railroad tie on his chest.  Oh, this is just awful.  This is a horrible couple.  I just don't want to see this. 
[01:09:00]  And this could have been sexy because it's kind of like real people.  It's not like a porn, which I would have liked.  Yeah.  Oh, look.  He's doing a little.  He's trying to get free.  He's trying to get free.  Oh, she's lifting her leg up like a dog taking a leak on a hydrant.  He's sniffing the balloon knot.  You can always say the key or secret word.  All right.  Wow.  He got loose, everybody.  Oh, she was doing something he didn't like, so he said the key word.  Yeah, putting that thing in his face.  That's it?  That's it.  All right.  That's the tie-up one.  That was awful.  Now it's off to romantic sex. 
[01:09:30]  Why don't we have these two banging?  No kidding.  Those ugly, awful people.  That was some horrible pornography.  All right.  Go back to the chapter selection if we can.  Yeah, good luck.  Steve, you think you could get there?  Martini Steve, what are you doing?  Don't pause it.  He paused.  Now go to the, yeah, touch the, no, the other, yeah.  No, the, yeah.  Steve, you got to go back up to the thing.  Yeah, go over there.  Oh, Nathaniel's got it.  All right, one of our choices.  We should look at one more real fast. 
[01:10:00]  We got sex games, sex toys.  You wanted to see toys, right?  Where's the sex swing?  Bungie Love Swing.  Bungie Love Swing.  All right, let's check out the Bungie.  Is that a black guy?  Yeah.  Uh-oh, we could have a big cock alert.  Bungie Love Swing.  Unable to read disc.  I think it's skipping a little bit.  Yeah.  Now you've done it.  Steve, what are you doing?  You're breaking this good equipment.  Steve.  Oh, it's starting again.  Good.  Now we're going back to the beginning for the 10th time.  This stinks.  Ah. 
[01:10:30]  That would have been a good bit.  That would have been another great bit today.  Two bits we couldn't do because of equipment failure.  African gentleman in a swing.  Yeah, exactly.  Steve's trying again.  All right, here we go.  We're trying again.  Bungie Love Swing.  Bungie Love Swing, Steve.  Click on that.  I didn't.  Did he click on it?  Yeah.  He did.  All right.  He clicked on it.  What are you doing, Steve?  Steve, did he click on it?  Yes.  Steve, you got to click on it.  Oh, why don't you click on it?  No, just click on that over there.  Oh, he's answering.  It doesn't look like he clicked on it.  You're not clicking on it.  You're standing here doing nothing. 
[01:11:00]  You didn't really.  Try a different one.  Try a different one.  Read the.  Why don't you just step on that awful PlayStation?  You got to pop the disc out and rub it.  I'll buy it from now.  I'll buy it from now.  Put some of that lube on the disc.  Oh, is that your personal one?  That Anthony smashed?  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'll buy you new controllers, Ben.  I promise.  What are you sorry for?  Ben should be apologizing to you for bringing in faulty equipment.  Bringing in crap like that.  Yeah.  You're right.  We're trying to make a radio program here.  So quickly.  All right, well.  What's the matter, Steve?  The disc is dirty.  Forget it.  The disc is dirty. 
[01:11:30]  The disc is dirty?  Ugh.  It just came out of the thing.  It came out of the packaging.  It just came out of the package.  Did Opie smear something on it?  I didn't do anything wrong.  As you passed it over?  Maybe that lady rubbed her fingers on her snatch and then smeared them all over the CD.  You got the touch.  Oh.  You got the power.  Yeah. 
[01:12:00]  Wow, wow.  Is this the original or from the movie?  This is the original.  Yeah, it's the original.  I want the one from the movie, too.  I want the movie one.  I know.  Yeah, the originals.  That rocks.  That almost hit me.  No, it didn't.  It did.  You got the touch.  Brendan in Atlantic City.  Yo, guys.  The only thing worse than watching bad porn is listening to people watching bad porn.  Ah, exactly.  Well, you know what?  We would have been able to go with it if our equipment's working. 
[01:12:30]  Half the time, we're just trying to get the video to play.  You guys slept late this weekend.  Oh, you don't like little Jimmy's comments on the pornography, sir?  I thought we made something out of it.  Guys from Atlantic City, yeah.  Go gamble.  Showed him.  Yeah.  Now what, Steve?  I told you something new about everybody's steak.  Did that thing really just come out of a package, like a shrink-wrapped package?  They just opened it.  It was perfectly well.  I don't know what's the problem.  Well, thank you, because it's completely scratched up. 
[01:13:00]  Really?  Yeah.  They sent us bad products.  They gave us scratched up, ridiculous porno?  That's impossible.  It just came out of the packaging.  Oh, we're back to Sinclair.  The Intimacy Institute.  Oh.  Now what are we doing?  We're going to...  We don't know.  See if it works.  They're chapter selection, but it's working a little quicker now.  All right.  Let's go.  Oh, good.  Bungie Love Swing.  Click on that.  I did.  Bungie Love Swing.  All right.  We just want to see if this guy's a big cock.  I just want to see this.  See the colored gentleman's hog. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, yeah, baby.  Ridiculous.  Who the hell...  Listen to the music they're playing.  It's like African.  Oh, my God.  A bungee swing for lovers can almost make zero gravity.  Look how far he's pulling his ass away from her.  He must be huge.  Let's see it.  This is awful.  Where are you going to hang a bungee swing in your apartment?  I don't know.  How practical.  How do you have sex without laughing?  Her teeth are like a hyena.  This thing hangs on a heavy-duty bungee cord that swings both up and down and side to side. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  Oh.  Nobody shaves in this.  Look at that snatch.  It looks like a wallet.  This is old video, man.  This really stinks.  Even though it looks like it's new, but...  Hey, it's a white chick.  Oh, at the bottom of her feet.  Well, it was in the bungee swing.  Well, he's a little darker than her.  She's cafe latte.  There's no pressure on her back or legs.  Who cares?  This swing makes standing position intercourse much easier. 
[01:14:30]  Makes smoking crack during sex even easier.  This guy's just violating her as she's in this whacked-out swing.  She has hair like Walona Woods.  I don't like her Walona Woods hairdo.  Oh, my God.  It's Kong music.  When does the pepper spray go on his face?  All right.  This is awful.  This is really horrible.  They're not showing...  Oh, wow.  They flipped her over.  How the hell did he get in that position in a swing? 
[01:15:00]  She's on her stomach.  She's on her stomach just swinging away as he's entering from behind.  In this awful swing.  Doesn't it look like she's getting choked by the swing?  That makes it hotter.  This is ridiculous.  Uh-oh.  Who has an apartment with 30-foot ceilings?  All right.  Well...  It's great.  If you live in the Sistine Chapel, buy this.  This sucks.  It really does.  Oh, they're going for the back of the ball.  Yeah, they don't show anything.  This is terrible.  This is silly. 
[01:15:30]  This is absolutely...  You want to see them violating her.  Yeah.  Sex shouldn't be silly.  I want to see that big thing just causing her complete spinal cord damage.  All right.  Well, enough of the...  Steve Hope wants this turned off.  The bungee love swing is awful.  Hey, thanks for sending in your...  Let's give them a little plug.  You know what?  There you go.  There's your plug.  The Sinclair Institute.  Stinks.  That's good stuff.  Just let it play in the background.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:16:00]  That's great stuff.  Yeah.  Hey, wait.  What's this one?  Oh, the erotic massage.  This is going to be hot.  Garbage!  Relax.  You know what the erotic massage is?  It's some expressionless Asian paying off a slavery ship debt while she jerks you off in some basement in Crown Heights.  God, that was irritating. 
[01:16:30]  Why the violence?  It's just annoying.  What do you do with that sausage, Ben?  We're going to see that in one of the videos, I'm sure.  Phallic foods.  You know, a dried sausage works great during sex.  Oh, God.  Me and my lover share dried sausage.  I think it's some dummy at the, what's it called?  The Bag of Leukemia Sexual Institute.  Boy, I'll bet you the Opie and Anthony Shaw would love this. 
[01:17:00]  It's really racy and they like that kind of stuff.  The Sinclair Institute.  Yeah.  Do you know how annoying it is when I'm hitting this and I can't break it?  I can't even break a DVD.  Oh, his little fingers gave out.  Good stuff.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  All right, here's the deal.  The second part of the sex DVD thing.  You heard the first part, hopefully.  This is where we get the twist in the whole bit, I believe.  Ooh, the twist.  Listen in.  Second act complication. 
[01:17:30]  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Bah!  Speaking of making friends, Anthony.  Ah, making friends every day on this show.  You want to explain what we did the other day with the sex videos?  This was a huge faux pas.  We kind of screwed up, Jimmy.  Well, don't say what we did yet.  Oh, I won't.  But for the new listeners, maybe you could, you know, recap it.  We had gotten two manila envelopes in the mail, Opie.  One to you, one to me.  We opened them up all excited. 
[01:18:00]  And we get presents all the time.  All excited.  And we get presents.  So we opened it up.  And there were about six, seven DVDs in each one that were lessons like sexual courses,  almost, that you could take with these DVDs where you pop the DVD in.  And it teaches you how to have sex.  Better sex with your loved one.  How to have sex in a pool.  Remember the sex swing at the office.  The Wade Boggs fella.  Yeah, the Wade Boggs fella. 
[01:18:30]  How to have better sex with your mate.  And it was a whole bunch of these DVDs.  You pop it in, you watch, and before you know it, you're learning things and having better sex.  You're having better fellatio and cunnilingus.  They were good.  They were actually very good.  Very good.  And we were watching and commenting on these.  Just destroying the videos.  These things.  And the people that made them and how ridiculous.  We weren't giving them rave reviews.  We were goofing on the cast.  Yeah, how awful they looked.  The guy looked like Wade Boggs. 
[01:19:00]  The girl was awful.  I think I screamed, your product is garbage.  Well, that was probably one of the tamer things that was said in the hour and a half that we spent.  We commented on destroying their product.  What we thought would be the lack of effectiveness of such a product.  Smashing it on the floor.  How awful it was put together.  Yes, and then the smashing on the console and stomping on them.  Hey, where's that one?  Oh, we already broke it?  Oh, we don't have that one yet?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We gave them a good trashing, right? 
[01:19:30]  We certainly did.  Well, I got a folder in my hand.  Yes, I see.  What's the folder, Ope?  Well, it's from the fine people at Sinclair Intimacy Institute.  Sinclair Intimacy Institute.  That sounds familiar.  Better relationships, better sex.  Did I say the fine people at Sinclair?  Oh, those are good.  Yes.  Of course you did.  All right.  Ah, really nice letter.  Oh.  That I guess came with the videos.  Came with the videos.  So we should have maybe read.  But we're not readers. 
[01:20:00]  This letter.  We just, before we went on the air with these.  We think reading's overrated.  Yeah, it's for facts.  Why read?  Right, Rich?  Hey, I agree 100%.  Dumb readers.  Readers with good vocabularies.  Anthony, the letter is dated December 21st, 2004.  Oh, that's recent.  Dear Opie and Anthony, enclosed in two packages is a little gift from Better Sex to You.  Thank you.  Thanks a lot.  We are starting an advertising relationship with you and your show on XM. 
[01:20:30]  Holy shit.  We are the dumbest sons of bitches.  We are stupid.  We don't think.  We're completely self-absorbed.  I feel right at home.  We didn't.  Why didn't we pull that out and read where it came from instead of opening?  This stupid.  Open.  This stupid.  How come his bitch not hard?  He looks like Wade Boggs.  What does she shave with?  Miracle-Gro?  Oh, self-destructive scumbags. 
[01:21:00]  Her ass under water looks like a sea urchin.  Remember all that?  That was a good one.  Yeah, let me back up.  So we are starting an advertising relationship with you and your show on XM,  running 60-second spots with high frequency starting in January.  Oh, good.  I can't wait to hear that.  We look forward to the success that the spots should bring.  Yeah, and Eric, tell everybody where you found the packages.  Crumpled up in the garbage. 
[01:21:30]  What packages?  We actually retrieved the packages from the garbage so then we could, you know, trash them.  Yeah.  Thanks for having us.  We've followed the show for quite some time.  Oh, no.  And when we revived our radio campaign earlier this year, you were at the top of our list for desired partners.  We are dumb little assholes. 
[01:22:00]  Why do we do this?  I don't know.  Is somebody supposed to open that and kind of look through it?  Please find someone to blame it on because we are just little douchebags.  Should it be the – I don't know.  Is there someone that's supposed to kind of –  Maybe Ben Sparks should have perked and jerked the envelope open?  Maybe somebody tried to read it but couldn't get the page jerking.  Couldn't keep it still enough?  Yeah, I don't know what it says, dude.  Perking and jerking his way through.  Do we have audio of us talking about their fine product? 
[01:22:30]  Oh, boy.  Derek in the other studio?  Well, I don't know.  Maybe –  Huh?  Well, let's –  Hold on.  Let's hold off there.  Maybe some people from Sinclair were on vacation yesterday.  Ah.  Perhaps –  I look forward to starting this relationship.  We can maybe talk about their product.  Let me tell you, I am so excited –  Very psyched.  Come on board.  All right.  Because from what I saw on those tapes, there are a lot of people out there that could probably  use a little help in the bedroom.  Sure.  Sure.  And I think the Sinclair Institute is there to help. 
[01:23:00]  Absolutely.  If you want to play third base –  It's very interesting that Anthony just said that because two days ago he did this.  Let's give them a little plug.  You know what?  There you go.  There's your plug.  The Sinclair Institute.  Stinks.  That's good stuff.  Just let it play in the background.  That's great stuff.  Yeah.  Hey, wait.  What's this one?  Oh, the erotic massage.  This is going to be hot. 
[01:23:30]  Garbage!  Is that it?  All right.  That's audio from two days ago.  We are the worst.  We are so dumb.  Let me clarify.  Yeah.  I was saying that it was broken so it should go into the garbage.  Right.  And please send another one.  I can use this.  Yes.  Maybe next time someone should give us a heads up because we could fake anything on this  program.  We stink.  We fake excitement every day on this damn show. 
[01:24:00]  All eager.  We opened up the envelopes, looked and went, this is stupid.  So let me reiterate, thanks for having us.  Thanks for having us.  We followed the show for quite some time and we revived our radio campaign earlier this  year.  You were at the top of our list for desired partners.  The Sinclair Intimacy Institute and the Better Sex Video Series have been around since 1991,  Anthony.  Oh.  With our product lines, we are dedicated to promoting healthy, happy and enjoyable sex  to everyone.  And it looked it.  Here's to success in January 2005 and beyond with you guys. 
[01:24:30]  That's, I can't wait for the campaign to start.  I think it's going to be great.  Thanks, John.  Tap into America.  Great.  Oh, my God.  We are asses.  What's the website?  We should give them certainly a plug so people can check them out.  Yeah.  Sinclair Institute?  I think it's their website's westink.com.  That should be our website.  I know, Anthony.  Is that, um, boss? 
[01:25:00]  Oh, freaking rich.  Was that scumbag?  Ah, stop.  That wasn't me.  You heard it.  It was him.  We haven't paid attention to you, so now you got a fart?  Ooh.  I need a can of Lysol over here.  Anthony heard him do it.  Anthony knows him.  Yeah, so that was rich.  Yeah, by accident when I stood up.  Oh, by accident.  What do you mean you just stood up?  Your little feet don't touch the floor until when they finally hit and pushed it out of  you?  You shrimp.  Shrimp.  No one said shrimp. 
[01:25:30]  When's the last time you heard shrimp?  Shrimp.  Oh, that's hilarious.  You shrimp.  Hilarious.  Oh, there you go.  They're going to be advertisers.  Oh, they are.  Probably starting next week.  Now, that is the first I heard is through an envelope that we got in the mail?  Yeah.  Shouldn't we have heard from somebody at XM?  Of course.  Maybe D or something should have alerted us to the fact that we have an advertiser?  Yeah, that would have been nice.  That really would have been nice. 
[01:26:00]  Maybe we wouldn't have been so harsh.  John in Jersey.  What's up?  Oh, hey, guys.  I just want to say I was listening to the show the other day, and, you know, the sarcasm,  I've been listening to it for a long time.  I bought the Better Sex video because it was so clear that you guys were just goofing and  being sarcastic.  You're right.  Right.  Very good.  You're good.  I just want to thank you guys in advance that you were advertising before you even knew.  It was great.  It was fantastic.  And I'm going to recommend it to friends.  My wife and I are going to watch it.  I'm going to shave it into a mustache, big hair. 
[01:26:30]  It's great.  All right.  You're good.  Very good.  Thank you.  Keep up the good work, man.  You guys are great.  Sinclair Institute.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Steve, Steve the Bear, Steve, Steve the Bear, sweet Steve the Bear, sweet face, so cozy. 
[01:27:00]  We go back to his place, and in his cave, he shows me his flame hat.  I wonder how he can wear that.  I wonder how many cubs got caught in his bear trap.  His flaming clothes are exotic, homoerotic, and like Steve, it should have never came out  the closet.  But if you wear it, the sideburn's got to be in good shape.  Can't be a cozy bear if your hair don't look great.  Steve, Steve the Bear, sweet Steve, Steve the Bear.

The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, this is Lois Griffin, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hey, cousins.  Eee.  Eee.  Like we said in the 60s.  Eee.  Eee.  Yes.  The immortal Cousin Brucie from our oldie station here in New York has to find a new job. 
[01:29:30]  And I guess what we're going to do here is play the time that you and I...  No, you know what?  This is an Anthony bit.  All the way.  And he did a stellar job.  Anthony acting like one of these oldies jocks.  That's right.  And me writing lines and throwing them at him.  You did nothing.  Hoo-hoo.  Hoo-hoo.  Rapping.  Tell him, Fred.  Shut up.  Fred's not saying shit.  No, Anthony is the star of this bit, and I want to sit back and enjoy, once again, 
[01:30:00]  Anthony as a oldies jock.  It's the worst at Opie and Anthony.  Uh, Matt, what's going on?  Um, listen, you guys better rip up Bob Shannon up on 101.  Why?  Because he was just ripping you guys up, and he said that they were in the newspaper that  they just cloned them to, uh, Monkees.  Uh-huh.  Because now that you guys, now they have somebody to take your guys' place, you guys should take  a break.  Oh, that's pretty funny.  Everybody talking about the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:30:30]  We don't mind.  We don't care.  Keep talking.  All right, guys.  Later.  On CBS?  CBS taking jabs at us?  Yep.  That's the elephant graveyard.  Yeah.  That's where, like, the old jocks go to die.  Hello, love!  How could they even do that?  Isn't that just a music station?  Don't they have, like, strict rules?  Who knows?  You know, you're supposed to just seg the songs, shut up, maybe talk about how cold it  is out, and go to the next, uh, Shirelle's song or something?  You have to go around the corner.  Hey, Donald, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  I was just listening to CBS. 
[01:31:00]  My uncle had it on, he said, uh, that they cloned twin monkeys.  Yeah.  And, uh, he said, Opie and Anthony can take a vacation now.  Keep talking about us.  That's pretty funny, though.  I can't believe it.  You guys are great, man.  Thank you.  You gotta give him something, because that's a pretty funny line, though.  It's a funny line, but if you're gonna try to, like, get to us, you gotta come up  with something a little bit more than that.  CBS have fun!  Hey!  Look, they cloned a couple of monkeys.  Looks like Opie and Anthony could be taken to vacation. 
[01:31:30]  Hey, get some CBS, uh, music.  We'll, we'll do it how they did it.  Probably in between records, because they only get, like, 15 seconds to do their shtick,  Anthony, you know?  Yeah, let's see if we can talk it up like, uh, like they do over there.  I wish we had the echo.  We need the massive echo chamber.  Oh, where it sounds like you're, like, uh, playing basketball in the gym and doing a radio  show at the same time?  Yeah, you're on a basketball court, it sounds like.  All right.  Wow.  Hello, love!  We don't have that, though.  I don't know why they do that. 
[01:32:00]  God, we must be pissing off just everybody in this business.  All right, Ant, you want to be the CBS, uh, FM DJ?  What song is it?  Dissing us, Joy to the World.  Oh, yeah?  Guess that you have to do it right up to the post, Anthony.  Okay, I'll try.  Hey, CBS FM!  It's Harry Balls here!  Oh, this is a short intro.  Yeah, we need a, I need a long intro.  We need a much longer intro than that, right?  I can't say who I am, the station, and rag us.  Yeah, we gotta, how about a little, uh...  Hey, Harry Balls here, CBS FM. 
[01:32:30]  You know, I'm reading, they cloned a couple of monkeys and the music's coming in now.  Hey, girl, what?  We don't have enough time.  Okay, I got one.  We got one?  All right, I got one.  Gotta have a long intro.  No, no, we need, like, 15 seconds.  Hey, everybody!  Harry Snatch with you, CBS FM.  I'm reading in the paper today that they cloned a couple of monkeys.  Looks like Opie and Anthony gonna be able to take a vacation.  The Hollies!  Blonde, cool woman in a black dress. 
[01:33:00]  This one taking you right back to September 1972!  Yeah, that's not bad, man.  Bravo.  Didn't have any more to babble.  All right, well, you want to do, like, a little, uh, weather break?  Do a quick, quick weather break.  You don't have much time here.  Ready?  Hey, Harry Snatch with ya.  Gonna be a little cold today.  Make sure you put on your sweater, CBS FM.  Hey, girl, what you doing down?

Remember, it's really cold outside.  So, uh, put on a sweater, or you'll end up brain damage like Opie and Anthony.  Look, I'm talking over the music.  I'm gonna get fired. 
[01:34:00]  Ha-ha!  Miss Taberain Man.  Miss Taberain Man.  I like the Shatner version better.  CBS FM.  Mr. Taberain Man.  All right, you're getting better as we go along here.  Ahem.  What the hell is this?  Ho-ho!  Gypsy Sluts and Whores on CBS FM.  I've gone in the wagon of a traveling show.  My mama used to dance. 
[01:34:30]  That's all they get to say, though.  Like, that's pretty much the gig over there.  You just gotta, you gotta do everything you've ever wanted to say in your life in like three seconds.  Well, since you would be down.  You don't even get a chance there.  Oh, that one, you don't.  Here, try this one.  Hey, everybody.  Harry Sack with you on CBS FM.  You know, they cloned a couple of bunkeys, and I can't talk about it because the music started.  I wish I was over at Eddie W.  See, he had to...  No, they don't give a crap.  He had to pick the perfect song to do it. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  I think this one would do it for you.  Here you go.  Hold on, man.  Hey, everybody.  Harry Sack with you.  Coming up next, nine-year-old boys with no teeth.  Next on CBS FM.  Hang on.  Oh!  Yeah, you hit the post there, my brother.  That was the one.  Very impressed with that one.  All right, wait.  Let's try this one.  Remember the Cher song?

[01:36:30]  Keep talking about us.  We can care less.  That is a talent, though.  You've got to give him that.  Uno, dos.  One, two, tres, cuatro.  Ho, ho, everybody.  Harry Snatch with you.  Wooly, wooly, wooly, that's how I like my girls  with a big hairy gash.  CBS FM.  Why did I get you?  Hey, everybody.

[01:38:00]  And pretty cold.  Make sure you wear your sweater.  I like catching, uh, catching humbers.  I'm catching one right now under the console  from Windy CBS.  I can get a job over there, right?  I think you can, man.  As long as you can goof on stupid stuff.  You just got to say inane crap  in between all the crappy music.  Hey, everybody. 
[01:38:30]  Harry Crotch with you.  And, uh...  Oh, dear.  I was just looking at the name of the song.  Well, it's a tricky job.  I keep stepping on the words  because I'm diddling myself.  CBS.  That's some gig they got over there, though. 
[01:39:00]  But if all you had to do  is, like, during the music,  plan out what you're going to say over the...  And listen to the beginning of the song 20 times.  Hey, the Osmond brothers!  You know, I'd like to, uh...  I'd like to anally rape the youngest one.  CBS!  Buy that look on your face, girl.

And dedicated to him, we'll play Just a Little Understanding.  Taking it right back to 1962, Frank.  We understand you.  We're listening here at CBS FM.  What is the purpose of the echo at CBS FM?  CBS.  It's to help enhance my voice so you can't tell them 101, just like our frequency. 
[01:47:00]  101, CBS FM.  God damn.  Rod Lundy, CBS FM.  How you doing, people?  This one's going to bring back some memories of those black exploitation films. 
[01:47:30]  What is this?  The deep to SWAT?  I thought it was Shaft.  I could talk through the whole thing, because there's no words in this song.  So I could talk it up right to the end.  Hey, let's go touch some children.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  I bet Frank didn't like that one.  Frank that just called in didn't like it, because he's a child toucher.

[01:52:00]  bleeding from the ass when you wake up.  CBS.  Just to love, love, love you, just to see me.  Well, now we're getting the request coming in.  Listen, Bloody Anus, could you play a little Three Dog Night for me?  Andrew wants to hear some Three Dog Night.  I remember I had a Three Dog Night once.

Lord, we thank you for Diana, whose life touched us all. 
[01:56:00]  The funeral of Princess Diana.  And for all those memories of her that we treasure.  We give thanks for those qualities and strengths that endeared her to us.  For her vulnerability.  For her radiant and vibrant personality.  For her ability to communicate warmth and compassion.  I thought the service was beautifully constructed. 
[01:56:30]  And I thought the way the hymns were sung, and the music that was there, and the words that were said.  Goodbye, England's Rose.  May you ever grow in our hearts.  You were the grace that placed itself.  Where lives were torn apart.  September 6th, history today.  I'm Scott Walterman, XM Satellite Radio News.

[01:58:00]  Your mom's box.  Freak dancing, amusement parks, what the hell is this one about?  I think they meant Freak Nick.  Oh, Freak Nick?  Yeah.  Freak dance.  Freak dance.  It says here in my sheet, black people take over towns during the freak dance.  That's how it's written.  Who wrote this copy?  Danny.  Danny's the racist?  That's a good one.  Jesus, it's called Freak Nick, and it happens in Atlanta.  I love this Danny wrote.  Let's see.  Colored people never have to wait in line at Great Adventure. 
[01:58:30]  Did you write colored people?  Colored people like grape juice.  Oh, my God.  Look what this says.  Black people also love the wave pool and are known as African rockfish.  That's what the amusement park employees call them.  Yeah.  It's very racist, but for some reason, a lot of people that die in the wave pools turned out to be black kids.  Are you trying to tell me that black people don't know how to swim?  Oh, I was shocked by you saying that. 
[01:59:00]  One of the stereotypes, I guess.  All right.  Well, freak dancing amusement parks on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Lo más mal de Opie and Anthony en XM2.  Zero dos.  All right.  We got to move on a little bit here, Anthony.  You were talking about, where was that again?  The high school kids doing the teens doing freak dancing?  Freak dancing.  What the hell is freak dancing? 
[01:59:30]  That's what I said.  I read the, I was reading in the paper, some school is supposed to have a dance, and they canceled the dance because the kids, they're freak dancing.  And I'm like, what the hell is this?  And then I'm seeing a bunch of schools are doing this.  They're kind of canceling a lot of dances, and parents are outraged because their kids are freak dancing.  There you go.  What is freak dancing?  It's suggestive dancing. 
[02:00:00]  You ever see when, like, chicks at clubs bend over and guys just get right behind them and start humping their asses and grabbing, like, their hair?  Isn't it like a form of dirty dancing?  Yeah, it's like the new dirty dancing, not the old dirty dancing, like Patrick Swayze dirty dancing, which isn't really dirty dancing, is it?  This is the new and improved dirty dancing.  Filthy dancing.  And it's kids, they said, like, from 12 years old, 12 up to, you know, 17, 18 years old, that are doing this. 
[02:00:30]  Some of the other moves are grabbing the girl by the sides of her head, by her hair, and shoving her face into your crotch, and then gyrating.  And she would then be bent over, and another guy could come up behind her and start humping her ass.  And this is dancing.  Oh, that's a little move called the lucky girl.  Ha, ha, ha.  Put her on the old rotisserie.  Ha, ha.  Right on the spit. 
[02:01:00]  And parents are outraged.  Uh, principals are stopping dances.  And the teens are saying, this is just the way they express themselves.  They say that their parents and their parents before them went through the same thing with their suggestive-type dances.  You know, Elvis himself had to be edited because of his gyrations.  Shaking hips.  Yeah, but it's a little different.  That's a lot different.  When you get a simulating, like, head while you're dancing.  A 12-year-old bending over, getting dry-humped by another 12-year-old. 
[02:01:30]  It kind of, you know, it's kind of different.  The parents are kind of right on this one.  You know, I hate to be in that whole thing.  Maybe it's just a little too sexy to think about.  You don't want to be the guy that goes, yeah, you know, you can't have that going on.  But you can see why the parents would be kind of pissed off at this.  You go to picture your little girl dancing.  You want to, you know, picture her in a ball gown doing some kind of ballroom dancing. 
[02:02:00]  Some nice slow dancing.  Not having balls slapping against her ass as she's dancing, you know.  Well, the older people are doing that dance where they kind of grab a rope and their pants are pulled down  and they get knocked into the water and they continue on and then their helmets are scraped up.  It's called do the humiliation.  Do you need a couple of firemen there to do it?  Sure.  How do you downplay the fact that your penis was rubbing up against the bridge as you're getting a cement culvert? 
[02:02:30]  Just your schlong rubbing there.  Ow!  Why were you nude?  Well, the water had pulled my trousers down.  Yeah.  It was such a torrent of water.  Some of your penis is left behind for flies to nibble on.  That filthy water just rushing into your open wounds on your schlong now.  Well, you know that it probably, when they yanked the pants down, it had to hurt a little bit. 
[02:03:00]  I mean, I'm sure that wasn't a gentle unzip.  No.  You would think it would hurt.  Bring it down.  It just must have been the worst when he was just almost up to that bridge.  Because, you know, the firemen are probably going, all right, give me your...  Oh, there he goes.  We lost him.  Oh, we had him.  He's probably thinking, hey, I'm out of this.  This is great.  It's a little embarrassing.  My pants are off, but...  Face first.  Maybe let go of the rope to cover up his junk.  Oh, the last thing the firemen saw was his white ass falling into the water. 
[02:03:30]  Skinny doctor legs.  Yam bag slapping that water.  That's just a great piece of video.  All right, so the freak dancing is going on, and pretty much no one gives a crap, right?  Well, the parents give a crap, and the principals.  But, I don't know, kids are, I guess, going to keep doing it.  Actually, we saw that done in...  The first time I even saw it was during Freak Nick.  Remember that in Atlanta?  Oh, my God, I remember Freak Nick. 
[02:04:00]  Remember Freak Nick in Atlanta?  Yeah, they flew us down to Atlanta for a job interview after we got fired from Boston  for saying the mayor of Boston died in a fiery car accident.  Yeah.  So, yeah, your pals almost worked in Atlanta.  Yeah, close.  Because Pat Irvin, Pat Irvin said, it's just like New York.  It's just like New York.  Atlanta's just like New York.  You'd be so surprised at how many displaced New Yorkers are down here.  He's telling us in the middle of dart night in a country bar. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  Where everyone had cowboy hats on, and they were throwing darts.  Nothing against that.  I don't really care.  But if you're trying to tell us it's just like New York, and this is what...  Oh, no, did I say I don't care?  Yeah, I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  But if you're trying to tell us, you know, it's just like New York as we're listening  to Garth Brooks and people play darts.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Sorry that we're not really going to believe you.  You get yourself a house out there in Buckhead, and you drive in Atlanta, do the show. 
[02:05:00]  It's just like New York.  And you get a lot for your money down here.  Oh, a dollar goes a lot further than it does up there in New York City.  Oh, stop it.  We're not moving down here.  Thank God New York wanted us as well.  Thank God.  Because we would have had no choice.  Yeah.  We would have lived in Atlanta.  Atlanta.  No.  So anyway, why Atlanta?  Oh, Freak Nick. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, they flew us down there, and Freak Nick was going on.  Now, this is spring break for black people.  I was going to say better known as Whitey Get Out.  Whitey, leave.  Whitey, leave.  Spring break without that pesky college to go back to.  They converge on Atlanta, and the shopkeepers board up their shops.  We saw this firsthand.  Yeah.  They board up the windows of their shops and just close down. 
[02:06:00]  They close down for that week or whatever it is, the weekend.  I guess it's a whole week, right?  Yeah.  Maybe.  And you'll be driving down the road, and all of a sudden, you're not moving anymore.  This is hilarious.  And you're in traffic, and you're pissed off because you've got somewhere to go.  And you look at it.  So you're thinking car crash or something.  It's got to be an accident or something.  And they're rubbernecking, and you're slowly going along like you do on the highway when  there's some kind of accident up ahead.  But it wasn't an accident.  What was it?  No, no.  It was some young black people dancing on their cars stopped in the middle of the highway. 
[02:06:30]  So the cars are stopped.  There's music just blasting out of these vehicles.  They've got super systems in these things.  They're on the hood of the car.  Remember the couple that was on the hood of the car?  Yeah.  On the hood.  The guy was basically mating with this chick on the hood of his car.  This one black chick, I remember this like it sticks in my head.  She had this big old ass.  Big ass.  I like big... 
[02:07:00]  She's bent over with her hands on her knees, and she's sticking her ass out.  She's looking over her shoulder with that face on, and she's biting her lower lip with  her head turned around, and this huge gentleman is behind her with both hands on her ass cheeks  just pumping away through the pants.  They're dancing. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're freak dancing, Opie.  You move.  Just like that.  And you know what Whitey does?  Just like that.  You sit in your car.  Just like that.  You roll your windows up.  You lock your doors, and you shut up.  You shut up.  You don't beep your horn.  You don't yell, why don't you move over to the side of the road?  Unless you want the Reginald Denny potted plant brick to the head thing.  Because when it comes down to it, us white people are scared S-less of black people. 
[02:08:00]  Black people?  Hello, black people?  We are petrified of you.  We are petrified of you.  In certain neighborhoods.  You can do anything.  Try that in Bensonhurst.  I'm sure somebody will be honking at you.  Yeah.  Someone will honk.  Hey, you mooly.  Yeah.  Get out of the way.  Get the fuck off the road.  You're so belligerent.  Hey, what's the matter with you, huh?  Get the fuck off the road.  You heard me.  Yeah, we're down there during Freaknik. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, Anthony, where was your road rage that day?  I've seen you road rage like nobody's business.  I saw.  Coming in from Long Island, bro.  I figured, why would I be in a rush or why would I get angry when I can enjoy another culture  and sit and watch?  I believe your quote was, this is a catchy song.  That's what I said.  Start snapping along to it a little bit.  That's what I said.  I said something like, wow, that's your figures.  And I said something like, oh, my God, I wish this road was bigger because then we could 
[02:09:00]  drive around.  I think it was something like that.  I think you also said, no wonder they don't have jobs.  No, I don't think I said that at all.  No.  Huh?  Ding, ding.  No?  All right.  Help me out.  Thank you.  I think I said, my favorite poo character is Tigger.  Yeah.  That's what I said.  Or maybe I wish I had a bunch of pinky triggers.  Right, yeah.  Things like that.  I was saying something like that. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  It was something like that.  I think.  Think about it, really.  Yeah.  I mean, you know something?  The nicest guy in the world can just turn into a stark, raving, racist lunatic in that  situation.  How long were you sitting there for?  It was quite a long time.  Until the cops come and tell them to move.  Let's just put it this way.  Bernie Getz would have had a field day.  Oh, forget about it.  I had something like that happen one time.  It was scary.  I think it was a great adventure. 
[02:10:00]  I don't remember exactly.  Great adventure is a great adventure these days.  Oh, my God.  Jump on the hood of the car.  That is.  Are you talking about the safari drive and a great adventure?  Six Flags.  It's just an adventure to get back to your car.  Six Flags Great Adventure in Jersey.  Wow.  You talk about some line cutting going on and just mob mentality.  You want to go there as a nice little white family?  Expect to spend twice the amount of time on lines than the black people. 
[02:10:30]  Because they will just walk right in front of you and give you a look like.  Don't even question why I'm doing this.  And you know something?  You don't.  You don't.  You'll just sit there and go, I've never seen a bigger roller coaster.  Nothing bigger than this roller coaster.  Or something like that.  Get out of the way.  That's what they say.  That's what they say.  And you get out the way.  Get out of the way.  Get out of the way, bitch. 
[02:11:00]  Get out of the way.  Move, Whitey.  Get out of the way.  And it's so hard in those situations to not have racial epithets just race through your mind.  Shouldn't it be get out of the way?  No, it's get out of the way.  It's quicker that way.  Get out of the way.  What do they call that at the amusement parks where you can get online?  You usually have to pick something up, a card or a key or something.  It's like a speed pass thing for the lines.  Yeah.  And then you hear this?  And then you come back at a certain time. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And you get on the ride.  You kind of have a reservation.  Yeah.  They all have that.  All right.  Only they don't need a card.  They don't have to visit anything.  They don't have to do it.  But they all have.  It's a speed pass.  Well, they got what's called a gat that they kind of just show.  You know something?  It's nothing but intimidation.  And when you walk in a great adventure, when I was a kid and used to go there, it was nothing like this.  You walk in now, it's like you're visiting Rikers.  There are metal detectors you have to walk through, a security line, a pat down.  I haven't been there since I was 12, I think. 
[02:12:00]  When was the last time you were there recently?  Like recently, yeah.  Why?  It's a friend's birthday party.  He wanted to ride some rides.  I just go there, and I just sat there like, oh my God, am I going to make it through this?  Am I really going to survive through this?  I've never seen a drive-by on a roller coaster until I went there.  It's fascinating.  They come down, or a log flume.  You see the splash of water.  You see the bullets fly.  You see some brothers fall.  Yeah. 
[02:12:30]  The photo, the police tape goes up.  Yeah, the photo of them with their guns in the air.  Like they don't care.  Like they just don't care.  Yeah, exactly.  And you can buy those photos.  Bill from Jersey, what's up?  Mug shots.  They take photos.  It's funny.  When you go on a roller coaster and you have your photo taken, at Great Adventure, it's  one from the front and one from the side, and they're holding numbers underneath.  Go ahead, Bill.  Morning, Fuzzy Love Tits.  How are you?  I'm good, baby.  Thanks for calling.  Hey there, Pally.  Down in Asbury, they have the Greek Fest. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah, yeah, right?  The black fraternities.  But the local law enforcement refers to it as Chocolate Sundae for the natives.  Chocolate Sundae.  That's so awful.  Oh, is that inappropriate.  Here we go.  Boston wants in.  Yes, Boston.  Oh, my God, Boston.  Go ahead, Pat.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hi, Angel.  Hi, Pat.  What's up?  From the city of racial sensitivity, Boston, Massachusetts.  Pat, what do you got?  Even in Western Mass Six Flags, the only thing that's empty is the water park, but... 
[02:13:30]  All right, see, this is Boston.  The only thing that's empty is the water park, because they can't swim, those people.  But down in Daytona, they have a thing called Black College Reunion, where they shut down  A1A.  Like you said, they board up the walls, and now it's just chaos for a little bit.  It is.  It's just whitey intimidation.  We get so intimidated.  F in Boston. 
[02:14:00]  It's very hard to enjoy yourself in those situations.  Boston never disappoints.  Yeah, the only pot is empty in the water parks.  Of course.  God damn Boston never disappoints, man.  Never.  Rev from Wackbag, yes.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, I used to go to Action Park in Vernon.  They used to bathe them in the wave pool.  All right.  It was the worst thing ever.  Enough.  He does bring up a good point.  But there is...  Action Park. 
[02:14:30]  I'm sorry.  We used to call it Traction Park.  Yeah.  It was the most dangerous amusement park ever conceived.  Ever, ever, ever.  You go to most parks, and it's very in control.  You know, the guests are not in control of the attraction.  You get on the roller coaster, you go.  You get done, you get off.  Action Park was some guy's idea of let the people control a lot of this stuff.  They had something called the Alpine Slide, where it was, you go up on a ski lift, and  it was what amounted to like a half pipe of a sewer pipe. 
[02:15:00]  You know, a regular round sewer pipe?  Sure.  They'd cut these in half and lay them down the side of this mountain.  You'd then sit on this oversized skateboard with a handbrake right in your crotch, and  you push forward, and it would lift up these little Teflon brakes on the bottom, and you  were on wheels in this pipe.  And you'd go down this thing.  To see people fall off and get just these big hamburger burn marks on their body.  They had these cars, these race cars, that weren't on a track, that you'd drive around, 
[02:15:30]  and people would crash and flip these things over.  They'd have the water rides and the wave pool, where, who's guarding the people?  Some numbskulled Jersey asswipe that's taking the summer off is sitting around there.  From his lifeguard.  They had more lawsuits and more people get killed and wounded at this place that they  had to finally just shut it down.  So it was great to go to, but again, there was a lot of intimidation when you used to 
[02:16:00]  go there.  Very scary.  Classic.  The phones have exploded.  Let's say hi to Jeff.  Jeff, what's up?  Go ahead, Jeff.  Hello.  You're on the air, sir.  Jeff.  All right.  We can't wait around today.  Ellis from Philly.  What's up?  Hey.  In Philly, we have the Greek picnic, appropriately located, right across the street from the  Philadelphia Zoo's primate area.  All right.  Oh, stop it.  Let's move on.  You know something?  You try to cover a subject on this program, and the listeners will take it to the umpteenth 
[02:16:30]  level that it was never intended to go.  Let's go to Birmingham.  Oh, Birmingham, Alabama.  This should be very sensitive.  Yes, Pat?  New York is not here in Birmingham, but if you're a white family, what you need to do  is you need to go, when it first opens up at 10, then you need to leave by like 12, 1  o'clock in the afternoon.  Why by 12 or 1?  It's very dark at like 12 o'clock and 1 o'clock in the afternoon. 
[02:17:00]  There you go.  There's Birmingham.  From the city of point of view.  Fire hoses in the streets.  Birmingham, Alabama.  Another area that never disappoints.  Yes, Jimmy?  Nothing?  Okay.  Pete from Jersey.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hi, Pete.  I worked at Action Park for about five years.  We grew up in northern New Jersey.  We had a line.  Well, not the Shulgi line, but they even had a speech that told the people who can't swim,  don't go towards the deep end.  But the black people did, and they couldn't swim.  We used to call them African rockfish, because there was always swimming at the bottom of  the pool. 
[02:17:30]  African rockfish?  Are you kidding me?  I kid you not.  That alpine slide was made out of concrete.  That's why you got all that hamburger, because I've done that myself.  Yeah, that was a frightening ride.  You know something?  I do remember a lot of the water tragedies that happened there were the black guys.  They'd go into the deep end, and for some reason, that stereotype of the swimming stereotype  would just hold up, and they'd have to get the lifeguards in there.  We hung with Earl this summer, and Earl didn't know how to swim.  Oh, Earl definitely not busting apart that stereotype. 
[02:18:00]  Not at all.  Petrified of the water.  Not only that, he wears dress shoes to the beach.  Yeah.  With black socks.  Go figure.  Black shoes, black socks on the beach.  We were walking on a dock.  We were tooling around in Ben's boat, and we had a, you know, it was a dock that was  no more than four feet wide, maybe even less, three feet.  He was petrified that he was going to fall in, as he's walking on the dock with his stupid  black dress shoes and black socks.  And then he gets mad at us, because we're laughing at him, because he doesn't have beach 
[02:18:30]  attire.  He would drown.  Mark, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, beefsit.  Hi, Mark.  Hey, listen.  I was at Six Flags Great Adventure, and that place is atrocious.  One of the roller coasters we were on broke down a little bit after the loading platform.  Yeah.  So we were on there for about 25 minutes before it started moving.  And then they said, all right, the ride will be moving shortly.  Well, this black girl goes, oh, no, it ain't. 
[02:19:00]  I want off this ride right now.  And they're like, man, we can't let you off the ride.  We can't reverse it.  It has to go through before it comes.  She's like, oh, no, I want off this ride right now.  You guys are racist.  They were arguing with her for about a half hour.  Finally, they had to get a crane, a special crane, just to get her off the ride.  Really?  Yep.  I find that hard to believe, sir.  Thank you.  Did he just go damn?  I think he was lying.  Yeah.  He was pissed off at his appearance. 
[02:19:30]  He's like, oh, man, they didn't buy it.  Damn.  Ron and Fez on XM 202.  Ron and Fez here.  And our show is coming to XM 202 starting Monday, September 12th.  Just in time for back to school.  Last time you were in school, Roosevelt was president.  Oh, yeah.  Which Roosevelt?  Either one is an insult.  Oh, beauty.

[02:20:30]  I'm Andy Langer.  Whether slaying buffalo, eating water, killing natives for sport,  the extreme adventurers included in British narrative historian Fergus Fleming's new book,  Off the Map, Tales of Endurance and Exploration, are some of the manliest men around, if not the stupidest.  Utilizing original journals, biographical histories, and age-old legends,  Fleming's work recounts the dizzying lives and eccentric quirks of 55 of our most fearless explorers, 
[02:21:00]  including Ferdinand Magellan.  He led the first circumnavigation of the globe until he was bludgeoned to death by natives in the Philippines.  And how about John Franklin?  He successfully charted the northern coast of Canada after an earlier expedition ended in desertion,  starvation, and cannibalism.  His applicable skills?  Hmm.  He couldn't hunt, canoe, or trek.  And he couldn't walk more than eight miles without being carried.  That was the 1800s, though.  Who knows what he could have found now with a fleet of Hummers at his disposal.

[02:21:30]  Hey, what's going on?  This is Bill Burr.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  This is their interview with me when I was doing the funny bone in St. Louis.  All right, Dr. Smith's on the line.  Dr. Smith?  Yes.  Oh, dear.  I love Jane Lost in Space. 
[02:22:00]  Hello.  Yes.  Young boy.  Yes.  William.  Hello, Dr. Smith.  Hello.  Hello.  How are you today?  Why don't you tell our listeners what you do?  I'm an osteopathic physician.  I do natural wellness in Cincinnati, Ohio.  Yes, indeed you do.  You have a book out, do you?  No, not a book.  What do you have?  A product.  Woo!  A product?  Yes.  You're a doctor? 
[02:22:30]  I sure am.  I am, too.  Dr. Smith?  You're a doctor of what?  I never really knew.  What type of doctor was I?  Yes.  A pediatrician?  Yes.  A gynecologist?  Oh, dear.  Spare me the poisonous bobs, Dr. Smith.  Dr. Smith, do you know who Dr. Smith is?  I certainly do.  Yes.  What's your product, sir?  It's a mood product. 
[02:23:00]  It's called Golden Mood.  Golden Mood?  Yes.  Are you sure you're not a dentist?  Because this is going to be like pulling teeth.  No, it's called Golden Mood.  It's for people who have the blues.  Are you taking this product?  Yes, I am.  Wow, geez.  There's an endorsement.  Give some to Major West.  He's such a prick to me.  That was what?  I didn't catch that. 
[02:23:30]  It says here, doctor, that more people die from medical mistakes,  each year than from highway accidents.  Is that statistically true?  Yes, it is.  Who cares?  I don't get it, though.  Everything I've read about you, Dr. Smith,  has to do with medical mistakes and whatnot.  But then, the first thing you mention is this product.  Yes. 
[02:24:00]  Is it an antidepressant?  Pardon me?  Is it an antidepressant?  Look at Rick.  Rick is now going, oh, no, I'm so dead.  Is Golden Mood an antidepressant?  It's more of a mood support product.  You could say that it has herbals in it that work as an antidepressant.  Big Kev, do you have a guest for us?  The guy in the suit, maybe?  Maybe the guy in the Lost in Space suit?  I probably could call him. 
[02:24:30]  What was his name?  May?  Bob May.  Bob May.  It says, are meds killing your sex drive?  Does this help with that, Golden Mood?  Help with your sex drive?  Yes.  This guy's killing our show.  Well, it won't kill your sex drive.  No, no, I'm saying because I've noticed that my sex drive has been down,  and I'm trying to get substitute teaching jobs to get it going again.  No, I don't think it'll help with your sex drive.  Yeah.  So what does it do? 
[02:25:00]  It's a mood support product for people who have problems with depression-type problems.  Rather than going on strong antidepressants,  they can go on something a little mellower, like the Golden Mood.  How does it work?  At the edge of the street.  Yeah, I know.  I wasn't paying attention that time.  Dr. Smith, you sound depressed.  You sound like a robot.  You're on this product, and it doesn't seem to be perking you up.  It doesn't perk me up?  No.  No, Dr. Smith. 
[02:25:30]  What medication are you taking, Dr. Smith?  I don't take any medications.  Aren't you taking your Golden Mood product?  Yes, I am.  Warning, warning.  This product increases boredom on radio programs.  Warning, warning.  You have the energy of a rock.  Dr. Smith.  Yes, sir.  You know, our Dr. Smith used to do things where we wanted to leave him on a planet.  Right now, I'm thinking I want you on another planet. 
[02:26:00]  Please, Dr. Smith, do something exciting.  I think I feel like I'm on another planet.  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Back to the Jupiter, too.  Dr. Smith.  Yes, sir.  You suck.  Thank you.  I mean, you're on a radio show.  It is a medium for speaking.  You drone on and on.  Like a bledianchor from the planet Curiaton. 
[02:26:30]  Warning, warning.  This is time.  We will never get back.  Dr. Smith.  Yes, sir.  Have you ever been on the radio before?  Let's start there.  I sure have.  This is sort of a new experience.  Where's young William?  Have you slipped him a Mickey?  Ha ha ha!  You have your own radio show.  I do.  Ha ha ha!  Even the robots laughing. 
[02:27:00]  Ha ha ha ha!  Don't give anyone a radio show, huh?  Ha ha ha!  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, if you pay some money, they'll give you one.  Ah!  Waddle doodle!  I understand.  Just like me, the grease man.  Warning!  Doug from Springfield wants to know if he's on the Zoloft from keeping from boring us all.  Dr. Smith, do you realize you are not that exciting?  Absolutely.  I'm a pretty exciting guy.  I guess I'm slightly intimidated.  What do you do for excitement there, Doc? 
[02:27:30]  What do I do?  Yeah.  Um, go to theater and go skiing and...  What kind of theater?  Go gambling.  We have some pretty nice theater stuff in Cincinnati.  A lot of the Broadway stuff comes here.  We took a gamble on this booking and lost.  What was the last...  What was the last show you went to for fun?  Uh, Blast.  Did you have a blast at Blast?  It was a blast.  It was great.  I loved it.  Wow. 
[02:28:00]  What a rousing endorsement for Blast.  It's no stomp.  But it's better than the Blue Man Group.  And you ski?  Uh, a little bit.  Yeah, I have.  I haven't went...  Obviously, I haven't went yet this year, but I think probably in the spring I'll go.  Yeah, obviously, because we know all about you.  Right.  Obviously.  You failed to mention that in the last ten times we talked on the phone at home.  Were you around when Larry Flint got shot in Cincinnati?  Uh, no, I wasn't here then. 
[02:28:30]  He did get shot there, though, right?  Um, I don't know if he got shot in Cincinnati.  I know he's got some hustler stores here.  Ah.  In the area.  Pornography.  So, how could you die from your medication?  From my medication?  Not your medication.  From medication.  Taking too many pills.  Wow, you are really breaking some ground with that statement.  Too bad you couldn't talk to Marilyn Monroe.  You idiot.  We could have saved Janice and Jimmy.  Holy S. 
[02:29:00]  You could die if you take too many pills, kids.  Uh, Dr. Earl, is your, um...  Is your product being sold successfully over the Internet, or can people get it in stores?  Um, it's sold over the phone.  Oh, yeah?  It's mail order.  Mm-hmm.  And, um, how would one go about getting your product?  Uh, there's an 800 number they can call.  Oh, what's the 800 number?  888.  888. 
[02:29:30]  Wonderful.  Wait, wait, what?  Dr. Smith.  Yes.  Dr. Smith, we were losing your communication.  Yeah, what happened?  We wanted you to give out that 1-800 number for your product.  What was that number again?  888.  And this way, you will get the product.  Dr. Smith, are you there, Dr. Smith?  Yes, I am.  Is there a problem with your phone? 
[02:30:00]  Are you, are you, you must be calling on a cell phone.  Yeah, that's it.  I'm on a cell phone.  Yeah, okay.  Do I detect sarcasm?  My sensors pick up sarcasm, Dr. Smith.  No, you wouldn't get any sarcasm from me.  That sounds sarcastic.  Are you a, are you a married fella?  No, sir.  More surprises.  Ha, ha, ha.  Dr. Smith.  Do you have a, uh, boyfriend?  Uh, no, I don't.  Girlfriend?  Uh, not really.  Dating. 
[02:30:30]  Dating what?  Girls.  Another robot?  Another robot?  Ha, ha, ha.  Do you slip her a Mickey?  Ha, ha.  Well, if that's what you call it.  Very energetic.  Ugh.  You're as exciting as bone cancer.  Yeah.  Whoa, hey.  How, how long has, uh, type of comment is that?  How long has, uh, gold, gold, what's, um, golden, um, mood been, uh, on the market? 
[02:31:00]  Probably about 30 days.  Who cares?  30 days?  Are you selling a lot?  I really haven't checked yet.  I've just started doing radio interviews.  Because it says that you want to make, it's supposed to make people's mood better.  Is it a bottle with an old person falling down steps in it?  No, but that, that might work, I suppose.  It's for some people.  Oh, you ever see an old hip bone shatter?  Cheers you right up.  What type of doctor are you?  Family practice. 
[02:31:30]  Do you get to see the young ones naked?  Not anymore.  Why?  Court order.  Since the court order.  Because of the court order.  I remember Dr. Smith used to like young William.  Is that correct, Dr. Smith?  You liked young Will Robinson.  How did you find that out?  You are a kid toucher.  I saw the episodes, Dr. Smith.  Why would the Robinson family allow a pedophile to roam around foreign planets with Dr. Smith? 
[02:32:00]  Hey, we got someone on the line that has, uh, tried the product.  What is it called again, Doc?  Golden Mood.  Golden Mood.  Golden Mood.  Warning.  And you're on it, and it peps you up, right?  Absolutely.  There's a guy, uh, his name's Dave.  He has tried your product.  Let's see what he thinks of the product.  Dave.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  Hi.  Uh, I tried Dr. Smith's product, and it really, really pepped me up.  Last week, I went lawn bowling, and I find myself full of energy and pep, and I am able 
[02:32:30]  to enjoy life a lot better now.  Well, that's a rousing endorsement for Dr. Smith's product.  I appreciate that.  Thank you.  I'm going to go throw myself off the Golden Gate Bridge now.  All right.  Thank you, Dave.  Well, Dave enjoys the product, Dr. Smith.  Well, I'm glad.  I'm glad it helped Dave out.  Do you have any celebrity endorsements besides Kurt Cobain?  No, uh, no, I don't. 
[02:33:00]  Can you imagine this guy off of the product?  Is it possible I could melt those pills down for a golden shower?  What were you like off the medication, Dr. Smith?  I was boring.  God, you should be a Canadian.  That was funny.  All right.  Uh, wow.  Uh, all right.  Well, let me, uh, let me go to Alan here.  Uh, Alan.  Hello, Dr. Smith.  I have a serious question for you. 
[02:33:30]  Yes.  Uh, if I use this product, Golden Mood, will it ease my bum hole after anal?  A very serious question for you.  Will it ease your what hole?  My bum hole.  You know, Dr. Smith, the balloon knot, the back door, the rear entry.  Um, probably, absolutely.  Absolutely, it will help.  Wow, now I'm excited about this product, Dr. Smith.  Well, uh, Dr. Smith? 
[02:34:00]  Yes.  So it'll ease the pain of the back door?  Absolutely.  Everything feels better.  Eli.  Yeah, oh, hey, how you guys doing?  Oh, good.  We're talking to Dr. Smith.  I have a problem, Dr. Smith.  Um, I get down a lot and depressed, and sometimes the only thing that cheers me up is, uh,  whacking my girlfriend a couple of times.  If I take your product, uh, if I take your product, will it help me out?  It'll give you the stamina that you need. 
[02:34:30]  Oh.  There you go.  No problem.  I, I, I, but, Doc, I think if you're beating up your, your wife, your girlfriend, you don't  want stamina, you idiot.  Georgia!  Thanks, Georgia!  Oh, we have another call on the line?  Hi, who's this?  Hi, this is Mike Tyson.  Hey, Mike.  Hi, Dr. Smith.  Yeah, Mike.  Dr. Smith.  S-M-I-F.  I can spell that one.  Dr. Smith, can I stop taking the Zoloft and go on this and still be in a mood where I 
[02:35:00]  don't kill y'all?  Um, are you still on?  I would love to punch you in your face.  You still on your lithium, Mike?  I need the lithium and the Zoloft.  I would take, I would, I would lay down.  I would say, thank you, Dr. Smith, and I would take the, the golden mood, right?  I would swallow it.  I would wait till it takes effect.  And then I put my big foot up your ass.  That's what I would do.  I would kick you so hard in your ass that you would actually maybe even for a second get  a personality.  This is awful. 
[02:35:30]  I don't know.  It's pretty funny.  What made you get into looking to pioneer a golden mood if I could?  What got me into natural wellness or?  Natural wellness.  What is natural wellness?  I've never heard that term.  I just don't use medications in my practice anymore.  It's all holistic.  It's all holistic.  Holistic medication.  Spirit, mind, and body.  But is that good for, like, tumors and stuff? 
[02:36:00]  Um, no, I mean, there, there's, there's a place for medications.  Medications are important, and they work.  Just taking too many of them.  What would you, um, uh, give a tumor?  A tumor?  Yeah.  Um, what kind of a tumor?  Uh, a, a malignant tumor?  What kind of a malignant tumor?  You have the charisma of George Harrison today.  Sir, let's just say that my rods aren't what they used to be. 
[02:36:30]  Your rods aren't what they used to be?  Yeah.  Can it help with the boners?  Why am I talking on this?  Can it help with the boners?  Can it help with the boners?  Probably Viagra.  Was that another joke?  Yeah.  Can you give him a laugh?  Oh.  Doc, you're awful.  Wow.  You, I gotta tell you something.  What's that?  You are absolutely the worst radio guest we've ever had on this show. 
[02:37:00]  You are probably, and I'm not, I'm not even being wacky, probably the most boring guy we've ever spoken to.  But you'll remember me.  I know.  Because I'm the worst.  I've never been the best at anything.  True.  So I'll be the worst.  He'll probably, um.  But, Doc, if you're going to promote a product that's going to pep you up, shouldn't you go on the radio really peppy?  Do some cocaine or smoke some crack before you do these radio interviews.  You have the energy of a sloth.  You working on anything else?  Holistic medicine. 
[02:37:30]  Are you working on a personality?  Anything like that?  Yeah, I've got other products in the making.  I guess I'm going to have to do some therapy or something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So why don't you give out the phone number for, uh.  The phone number is 888-241.  And we got operators standing by?  Absolutely.  Dr. Smith, I have to ask you something.  Sure. 
[02:38:00]  You say you're a family practice?  Right.  Yet you don't prescribe any type of drugs?  Nope.  All right.  Can we play a game?  Absolutely.  What year was Dr. Smith's license taken away?  Can we play that?  And why?  And why?  And why?  Can we play?  Yeah.  When did he get out of drug therapy himself?  Was that it?  Yeah, no.  You started dipping into the medicine cabinet yourself?  A little to the morphine.  Oh, need morphine.  I think there's a story with Dr. Smith.  There's some kind of story because there's no family practice.  This guy that doesn't prescribe the dope. 
[02:38:30]  It was at the same time when I quit doing the pelvic exams on the women.  Oh, the pelvic exam.  The pelvic exam.  Was there some type of touching thing that happened?  It was the pedophile, the drug thing.  It was the whole thing.  It was so stressful.  It just all came together at once.  Dr. Smith, I'm being serious here.  There has to be a story why you're not prescribing drugs to people.  Did you ever prescribe drugs to people?  Sure.  Yeah, I worked for 20 years.  20 years.  And then what happened? 
[02:39:00]  Something happened.  Something happened.  What happened to change your outlook on medicine?  Well, I had to come up with one incident, I guess.  You know, you're probably right.  I lived in Branson, Missouri.  Uh-huh.  And my mom died from overuse of medication.  Sorry to hear that, Dr. Smith.  Sorry.  I appreciate the symptoms. 
[02:39:30]  Wow.  Where's everyone going?  Over medication.  Jim is in a corner right now.  Right.  From over medication.  Right.  All right.  What was the drug of choice?  What was the drug of choice?  Of your...  Like what was the ailment and what was prescribed and how did it happen?  Of your dear old mom.  It was just an anti-inflammatory.  You know, she just...  Her stomach, she bled to death.  Sorry.  God, that's...  That's depressing.  It wasn't you that prescribed it, though, right? 
[02:40:00]  No, not at all.  Oh, okay.  Just because that would have been even more tragic.  Well, why was she taking the drug?  It was because of some kind of...  Arthritis.  Arthritis, yeah.  Arthritis?  Right.  She had arthritis of the stomach?  No, arthritis.  And then she took an anti-inflammatory, and I guess she was over-medicated, and it caused  her stomach to bleed?  Mm-hmm.  Did it explode?  No, it wouldn't explode.  It would just kind of bleed open.  Yeah, it bleeds.  Yeah.  So did she get bloated and stuff?  No, they...  Why didn't anybody see this happening, and maybe...  When it happens, it happens pretty quick. 
[02:40:30]  Was it?  Yeah.  Well, what happens?  She just...  She bled, and they tried to take her stomach out, and she died on the operating table.  Wow.  Huh.  Jeez.  So, then you decided that medication was no good, right?  Yeah.  That kind of...  Bad medication.  That kind of put you over the line? 
[02:41:00]  Right.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Here's one for the old-timers.  You mean me?  Wow.  So that...  Then you went into holistic medicine.  How old were you when your mom died, if I may ask?  Okay.  45, I'll say.  All right, Dr. Smith, thank you so much.  Okay, buddy.  You want to give out that phone number once again?  No.  Why wouldn't...  Hey, that's the best, funniest thing you've said.  Why wouldn't you want to give out the phone number?  I'm insulted. 
[02:41:30]  Um, no.  What's the matter, Dr. Smith?  You okay?  It's like Linus and the football or something, you know?  It's like I'm going to be kicking the football.  Nope, I'm not going to do it.  Dr. Smith.  Oh, now you're going to make us feel bad.  No, no, no.  Give it out for the plug.  Give it out for the plug.  What's going on Wednesday over there with this wow thing?  Wow?  Wow.  Wow.  I don't know anything about wow.  Oh, come on, guys.  You're more depressing than old yeller.  I just talked to a friend of mine in New York, and he told me that on Wednesdays, you guys 
[02:42:00]  do a wow thing.  Really?  Yeah, whip them out Wednesday.  Girls like flash guys on the way home if they see wow in their car.  Yeah, like why couldn't you call me on Wednesday?  Maybe that would have put me in a better mood.  You're in a bad mood?  Why?  I'm not in a bad mood.  Did we get off to a bad start?  No, no.  No, I just don't.  Why don't you free your mind here?  Why don't you tell us what you think of us?  You all right?  What I think of you guys?  You all right?  You all right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You're a lot of fun.  You sound a little...  It sounds like you're going to take a warm bath and slit your wrists after you hang 
[02:42:30]  up the phone.  You have any friends, Dr. Smith?  Do I have any friends?  Yeah, you got any friends?  I think I got a couple.  That's good.  All right.  You get laid?  You said he's dating, Ope.  It hasn't been real recent I haven't gotten laid, no.  You want us to get you laid?  Out in New York?  Yeah.  Eh, you know.  You made up that over-medicating story, right?  She died from boredom of one of your visits.  I'm not even a doctor. 
[02:43:00]  You're not?  You want?  I'm not even a doctor.  Then why are you Dr. Smith?  Well, I had to come up with something.  Hold the phone.  What?  You're doing...  You said that you'd practiced 20 years and you were an emergency room doctor.  I know, but Dr. Smith couldn't take the call and he asked me to come in here and sit and  talk on the phone.  Said there were a couple of jerks from New York calling and he wanted to...  Say he's trying to be wacky.  I think you're lying, Dr. Smith.  No, I'm not.  You're Dr. Smith.  No, no, I'm not.  Dr. Smith would never have somebody else come on when he has something to talk about. 
[02:43:30]  That's right.  He was busy and he just asked me to come on and sit here and...  I give you credit.  It's a good out.  I like it.  Okay.  I like it.  I want people to think that you really are a bore because you want people to buy your product.  I understand all that.  That's okay.  Kirksville College?  And the mom's death thing, pretty sad.  That was sad.  Very sad.  I understand that.  Yeah.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  Well, thank you, Dr. Smith.  Okay, guys.  Good luck with the product. 
[02:44:00]  You sure you don't want to give the number out again?  I really feel bad now.  And you know what?  Ant and I, we like to goof around, but when it's over and done with, we like to make good.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm serious.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Dr. Smith, you were a good sport.  You took our abuse.  Yeah.  You took everything we threw at you.  You didn't hang up.  You hung in there.  You're a good guy.  So we got our fun out of you, and now we should make good.  Okay.  You ready?  The phone number.  888.  Right. 
[02:44:30]  Go ahead.  I didn't do nothing yet.  248.  Right.  Right.  Very good.  All right.  Thank you, Dr. Smith.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye-bye.  There he goes.  There he is.  Our new pal, Dr. Smith.  Dr. Smith.  We better keep in touch with that guy.  I like him.  He's going to kill himself soon.  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Party radio with Dr. Smith.  That was some of the most uncomfortable radio I've ever heard. 
[02:45:00]  You actually left your seat and walked into the corner when Opie played the canned laughter  over the mom's story.  That was probably the worst use of canned laughter I've ever, ever heard.  Wait.  Russ wants to say something.  Russ, what's up?  Man, I know you go for the cringe radio thing, but with the mom on the operating table and taking  out the stomach, oh.  You're going to hell, guys. 
[02:45:30]  You are all going straight to hell.  Norton, you rule.  Thanks, man.  Later.  Okay.  Goddamn.  Goddamn up-tempo number after mom dying.  Linus in the football.  Linus in the football.  Very good analogy from the very boring Dr. Smith.  I'm not Dr. Smith.  Except it's Charlie Brown.  I know, I know, but I didn't want to correct him.  It's so funny. 
[02:46:00]  He's just like, I'm not Dr. Smith.  Then he's like, I'm not Dr. Smith.  That guy was...  Great job.  Great booking.  Great booking.  Thank God we could go with just about anything with this radio program.  Imagine a real radio show that had to have him on.  What would they do?  So tell us more about your prep.

This is an Operation Helping Hand, XM Satellite Radio and Red Cross update. 
[02:48:00]  President Bush taking time out over the holiday weekend to visit the American Red Cross Operations Center in Washington, D.C.  If you want to help, help this country heal after the result of this disaster, please give cash money to the Red Cross.  Call 1-800-HELP-NOW.  There's over 5,000 Red Cross or nearly 5,000 Red Cross volunteers that are working long hours at shelters in 19 states  to help these folks that have been displaced get their feedback on the ground. 
[02:48:30]  XM Satellite Radio and the American Red Cross have once again teamed up to activate Operation Helping Hand.  You can help.  Call the Red Cross to donate.  To volunteer.  1-800-HELP-NOW.  Good evening.  I'm Richard Cheese, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Thank you.  Good night.  Also, Anthony, I hope we can get to it today. 
[02:49:00]  Yes.  We have one of our favorite, favorite, I don't know, friends of the show.  What do you want to call them?  Just one of our faves.  The Iron Sheik.  Iron Sheik.  One of the best interviews we ever did, Jimmy.  Love the Iron Sheik.  And then he did liners for the show.  Can we play one of the liners as we go to break?  What a complete ass this man is.  All right.  You can do it there.  All right.  Dirk's going to do it for us.  Pledge out for me.  But when we get back, we have audio of our friend, the Iron Sheik, doing his acceptance speech for the WWE Hall of Fame. 
[02:49:30]  And it's pretty much the same babble that he did for us when we interviewed him that day.  Just in case you never heard.  You don't have it?  I got it.  Oh.  Hawk's got it.  Hawk always on the move.  See if it works.  Derek couldn't find it.  Eric did find it.  Oh, now they're screaming.  No, no.  It's nothing.  Are you on the air or is this just in my headphones?  No, I'm on the air.  All right.  Go ahead, Derek.  He fucking names everything.  He changes the name of everything in the folder all the fucking time. 
[02:50:00]  I will back Derek up on this one.  To undermine you guys.  It is true.  This is way too inside for the listeners.  Someone explain.  No.  Derek.  All right.  Derek.  What happened?  Oh, they're going to fight.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Oh, Eric.  Eric likes to reorganize things.  He's very organized.  And what he does sometimes is he'll rename and retitle things.  So what you're saying is Derek would have easily found it because he was used to it  being named one thing.  Correct.  And now it's named something else.  It's been renamed since the last time Derek had to play it.  Derek thinks that there's...  Derek, what was the original name of it? 
[02:50:30]  To tell you the truth, I can't even remember.  It's the same name that it always has been.  It's a liner iron sheet.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  Eric, you...  Oregon...  The shit is impossible to find half the fucking time.  There's just so much...  There's been in the other room.  Artists are just there on the screen laughing.  It's just stuff gets changed so many different times.  You rename things all the time.  Why would you rename anything?  Well, maybe because it needed to be organized or maybe he had a typo for the millionth time  on something.  Why would you rename anything?  Oh, typos.  Hey, I put them in here. 
[02:51:00]  I know where they fucking are.  Really?  Then why didn't you play it?  I don't put your gay stuff in there, dude.  Oh.  The stuff I put in there, I know where it is.  Jesus.  Because I play it.  There's a great look behind the scenes that happens every day.  Wait a minute.  What gay stuff does he put in?  Apparently the Iron Sheik audio is gay shit, right?  Wait, what else?  Dude, I swear to God, I get phone calls and emails from people all the time about folders  and you putting stuff in here and stuff, and I have to go through there and clean it out.  Uh-oh.  Right. 
[02:51:30]  You do, man.  Okay.  You're putting stuff in folders that don't belong in?  I want an example of his organized gay stuff.  I want to hear more of Eric's stinging retort.  Right.  Right you are.  You betcha.  So what are you saying?  You're saying that he's typing a shit.  What are you saying?  I mean, like, the stuff was never changed.  It's been there since it was put into the system.  Have you renamed anything?  No.  He's saying he's never renamed.  Oh, my God.  That's not true.  No, no, no.  Other stuff, yes.  This Iron Sheik stuff, no, I have not.  Oh, you rename other stuff, though.  Constantly.  Why would you rename something? 
[02:52:00]  So it's better organized.  Wait, wait.  How is it better?  Wait, wait, wait.  How is it better organized if everyone knows it as one thing and you change it?  How is that better organized?  That's the point.  That's the point everybody's trying to make, Eric, is you are a very organized person and  everybody's aware of that, but the reality is when you're the only fucking person who knows  what it's titled, it's not organized.  It's not organized and we can't fucking find it anymore.  Now, what is an example of one thing you've renamed?  Let's give us an example of what you've renamed. 
[02:52:30]  Any of the stuff?  That's not an example.  One example.  Something specific for listening.  Something was called something and you renamed it what?  There's been a lot.  I can't name it.  Give us one.  Like, for instance, on one folder that said producer, now just says guy with glasses who  laughs a lot.  That's the beauty of Ben.  How do you not love Ben?  You can hear him cackling in different rooms.  How do you not love?  He's taking a purse on the show and all hell's breaking loose and all he has as a response  is a cackling.  Ben, a laugh in the background. 
[02:53:00]  Ben is fucking zellig.  He just shows up in all these places.  Whenever there's awfulness, all you see is that fat head with glasses.  Ah!  This is funny.  This is funny stuff.  He was in here laughing at Jimmy.  Right, because he smashed Jimmy.  He smashed Jimmy.  Yeah, Jim left the office.  He goes into the production studio next door, into the producer, and he's cackling at these  guys yelling at each other.  Because they, because what happened was, is Eric moves the folders, Derek doesn't know 
[02:53:30]  what, he changes the names, and doesn't tell anybody, so that's what happened.  So he was trying to find the Iron Sheik ID, which we played on Tuesday, and now we can't  find it.  Wouldn't it be labeled Iron Sheik?  Yes, it is.  Sorry, alphabetical order might be hard for him to grasp it.  Whoa!  Derek!  Listen, motherfucker, dude.  It should just be in the fucking computer as Iron Sheik.  It's got, you have all this shit organized, and you can't find it yourself half the fucking 
[02:54:00]  time.  You came in this morning looking for shit.  What is it labeled in there?  What is it called?  It's right there on the screen next to you.  Artist is ID, O, and A, and the title is Liner Space Iron Sheik 01.  So you have to know, you have to know what it's in there in terms of its category.  Eric will assign a specific name.  ID, O, and A is a liner, is a title that Eric came up with.  Oh, so he's saying it's still named Iron Sheik, but it's in so many subfolders.  Correct, thank you.  That have different names on it.  It's not under I.  It's not in the subfolders.  It's one file in one folder. 
[02:54:30]  It's always been there, and it's always been labeled that.  Nothing was changed.  It's very shaken.  Steve begs to differ.  Steve begs to differ.  I've been in a situation, look, I'm not going to criticize Eric's organizational skills.  They are impeccable over anybody's in here, but when he's the only one who knows what the  changes have been, it makes it very hard for everybody else to find stuff that we're  looking for.  Danny is now pointing at the screen like he's found something to really rail Eric on. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, here it is.  Yes, Derek.  The last modified date for the Liner Iron Sheik, which was the 14th.  So, days ago.  Days ago.  About a week or so ago.  About a week and a half ago.  He had changed something with the Iron Sheik file.  And it's always been in there.  And they've always been in there.  Oh, Ben.  Just to make it perfectly clear, Ben is the boss of all these guys, and that's all he has  is to just laugh at them.  Ben's just laughing his ass off.  I love this. 
[02:55:30]  This is funny.  This is funny stuff.  This place is hysterical.  So, why did you change it?  I don't remember changing that.  How could you not remember changing it?  It must have been important enough to change it.  That is the same file.  Anytime we went to play that file, those files have always been there and always had that  name.  I don't know why it was changed on the 14th.  I don't know what I did to it.  But it was always there.  Remember when it was just you and I?  You and me, and it was carts.  You and me, and just carts.  And Iron Sheik was written in marker on a cart, and Opie would pop it in and hit a button, 
[02:56:00]  and you'd hear it.  Now there's folders and subfolders and dilette, and there's names being changed by one person.  There's a staff of 15.  There's 15 people and a cackling leader.  Cackling leader.  He is great.  They're yelling at each other.  That's the type of guy, because he likes to stir up shit.  He's the type of guy that distributes the lead paint chips, and then just goes room  to room and laughs at the sick babies. 
[02:56:30]  All right.  Well, Eric's going back to his station.  We have found them.  Just to add to that whole mess that you guys just heard for 10 or 15 minutes, all hell  is breaking loose, and this little thing on the top of the pen fell off and rolled under  the broadcast thing here, and I'm on my hands and knees trying to find it, because something's  going to happen if I don't find it.  Because you're insane.  Right.  By the way, I was gone for about a minute of that whole thing, because I'm on my hands 
[02:57:00]  and knees crawling around trying to find this stupid thing to the pen.  And no one even noticed you were gone.  The lunatics.  So do we have it now?  I mean, let me ask the producer, Nero.  He's off cackling.  I love my fiddle.  Don't.  Don't.  You got a bucket of water?  He's the best, man.  Can't get enough of a pen who's laughing. 
[02:57:30]  All right.  All right.  So what do we do now?  Well, we can play it, I hope.  Who's got it?  Derek?  Derek's got it.  Derek's got it.  Wait, which one do you want to play?  I have number two.  You know what that means to me?  Nothing.  Nothing.  You know what that means to me?  Glad Baggy's in the bathroom.  It actually meant something to me, because that was the one I wanted.  The one that's 55 seconds long, right?  Yeah.  Oh.  All right.  But I'm wrong for knowing when Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath came out. 
[02:58:00]  I know.  He knows what number two is.  Number two?  That's colon 55.  Well, Anthony picked up on something this morning that goes along with all this shit.  The CD that was missing?  Oh, I know.  It was frightening.  There's a shitload of CDs in front of Opie on any given day, and it's stuff from news clips  to songs that people send in.  The Mississippi Burning Clip.  Mississippi Burning Clip.  Like, there's just...  Penguin sounds.  There's CDs everywhere in plastic cases with papers that have printed a little menu of  what's on the...  Track listing. 
[02:58:30]  Track listing of what's on the CD.  The audio of the latest assault on the media.  They're all over.  To anybody walking in here, you would think they're just thrown out there willy-nilly.  Opie comes in.  We come in a little early to listen to a couple of things.  And he looks down and goes, where's the CD?  Which CD was it?  Sue Johansson.  Where's the Sue Johansson CD?  I'm like, what?  We haven't even...  I go, oh, a new one?  He goes, no, no, the old one.  It's here just in case we need to go to it at some point.  I gotta go to stuff.  Just in case we're sucking wind.  And it's not here.  I'm like, how would you...  How the hell do you even know that one's missing? 
[02:59:00]  He knows every CD that's there, what's on them, where they are in front of him.  They're positioned in some type of fucking order.  I don't know.  In order of confusion.  Poor Eric tries to keep up, and Opie's like, dude, I told you to organize these in order  of things I may possibly think of.  That's so true.  That is.  Who's in charge here?  Who stole my lunch out of the fridge?  And what's on my XM?

You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  The worst.  It's absolutely awful.  Enjoy it.  Anthony, Siskel and Ebert Audio.  Ah, yes.  These are outtakes from when Siskel was still alive, obviously, and Ebert, and they were  working together.  And they're bashing each other.  Yeah.  It's pretty simple, pretty easy.  That's about it.  Ebert's pretty funny, actually.  Yeah, I remember this.  I loffed and loffed and loffed and loffed. 
[03:01:30]  Yes, we did.  I loffed and loffed and loffed.  Me too.  So sit back and loff with us.  Nice.  Not at us.  With us?  Yeah.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Siskel and Ebert, Anthony, finally?  Sure.  Okay.  I'm going to get the show back on track here.  Having a fine program, though.  A lot of fun.  A lot of fun.  Siskel and Ebert.  Outtakes.  Mm-hmm.  This was done, obviously, years ago, because Siskel is dead. 
[03:02:00]  This was his previous, Ebert's previous partner, and still when Ebert was big and fat.  And they would do these promos.  They would have to take promos for upcoming shows.  And you hear them do the promo, but in between, they're just miserable sons of bitches that  are ragging each other.  The writers, whoever's ever writing their promotion copy, anything.  They just come off as real miserable guys.  All right.  Here's the first track. 
[03:02:30]  Last week?  No, this is...  No, it's not.  Don't worry about it.  I know.  He was wearing a brown sweater.  This is not the part that's supposed to match, Slick.  Give it a moment's thought.  What are we doing now?  The promos.  Mm-hmm.  Do you know what they have to match?  Nothing.  No promo ever has to match anything.  I thought we were about to do...  Welcome to the exciting world of television.  A wholly new field for you to begin to learn in.  Well-spoken, Roger.  Well, that's something that you rarely hear.  A compliment really paid to you. 
[03:03:00]  Gene Hackman and Kevin Costner in the Pentagon Thriller No Way Out.  That's this week on Siskel and Ebert.  You sounded very jaded.  You sounded...  What a dick.  Very jaded.  You can tell he's just a dick.  And he said, well-spoken, Roger.  And he goes, yeah, that's the compliment you'll never hear.  Because the guy can't talk.  For some reason, Siskel is mumbles.  I think that tumor was growing in his head as this was being taped.  Because he goofs on him about how he can't speak. 
[03:03:30]  He cannot...  He's all mumble-mouthed, tripping over words.  87, that must have been.  That's when the movie came out, I believe.  Oh, was that it?  Yeah.  No Way Out, sure.  Oh, good one.  David?  Stop touching me!  Two thrillers this week on Siskel and Ebert.  First, we'll review Michael Caine and Pierce Brosnan in The Fourth Protocol.  And then Gene Hackman and Kevin Costner star A No Way Out.  And we have a third thriller, too, if you're interested.  What do you mean, two thrillers?  They left out The Big Easy.  They only review two movies in every promo. 
[03:04:00]  So we got...  They picked those two.  Why?  Why those two?  I don't know why.  I didn't pick them.  Ask the person that picked them.  Okay.  I think they probably went for star names.  It's this nitpicking that's going on between the two of them.  They hate each other.  Yeah.  They hate doing this.  Ebert hates that he likes to soak his Doritos before he eats them.  He hates that Roger, Siskel, fucking whoever, whatever their names are, fuck them. 
[03:04:30]  Fatso and Stemless.  Siskel's got a head full of soaked Doritos.  Like a little chip bowl for him.  Man.  Just saying the name The Big Easy without any people involved means nothing.  It means nothing.  Randy Quaid.  Is he a star?  Dennis Quaid.  Close.  Dennis Quaid.  No.  Okay, read it this way then.  Read it this way.  How about, no, let's, why does this always have to be lockstep? 
[03:05:00]  How about something like this?  It's Thriller Week on Siskel and Ebert and we've got three big ones.  And then three one-liners.  Dennis Quaid in The Big Easy.  Michael Cain in the fourth protocol.  So and so and no way out.  That's a better promo.  Okay.  Ready?  I guess you're going to do it.  We have to rewrite it, don't we?  Because you can't.  Oh, no.  Let's.  You can't ad-lib, Gene.  Can we, can we do for the last week and when next week we'll do it?  Next year we'll do it next year.  No, every week counts. 
[03:05:30]  You read it then.  You ad-lib it.  I'll do nothing.  Let him do whatever he wants.  This is going to be today's theme.  That's why I think we ought to write it into the.  No, let him do it.  Why don't we just have Gene say it's Thriller Week on Siskel and Ebert.  Roger does the.  I think I'd like to have it written on the monitor of that.  For yourself.  Yes.  Okay.  So you start at the top, okay?  Take and pause, then.  Start at the top or make a new one.  Okay.  Yeah.  Wow.  I had no idea.  They cannot stand each other. 
[03:06:00]  Of course he can't ad-lib.  He's got one inch of room in there for brain.  No ad-libbing coming out of that pudding skull.  Four plus four is.  Better ad-libs out of a plate of chopped meat.  Also a more solid structure.  We have more outtakes from the guys.  Siskel and Ebert.  This one, uh, Siskel, wait, uh, Ebert is telling Gene that he needs more energy. 
[03:06:30]  It's Thriller Week on Siskel and Ebert in the movies, and we've got three new ones.  Got to have energy up and the movie's out.  Why don't you read both parts?  I'd like to.  I know that.  Please get your energy up.  I can't read the top line.  There we go.  It's Thriller Week on Siskel and Ebert in the movies, and we've got three new ones. 
[03:07:00]  Dennis Quaid in the Big Easy, Michael Caine in the fourth protocol, and Kevin Costner and Gene Hackman in No Way Out.  That's this week on Siskel and Ebert and the movies.  Sound a little excited, Gene.  Sound less excited, Roger.  Fuckface.  Oh, wow.  Got to hear that part again.  And Ebert and the movies. 
[03:07:30]  Sound a little excited, Gene.  Sound less excited, Roger.  That's why we're redoing it, because of what you did.  It's Thriller Week on Siskel and Ebert at the movies, and we've got three new ones.  And the movies, not at the movies.  And that's why we're redoing it this time.  Come on.  God damn, these guys hate each other.  Dude, come on.  This is great.  They hate each other.  They hated each other, dude.  I love this behind-the-scenes audio from celebrities.  Because you watch the show, and they're all like, 
[03:08:00]  Oh, come on, Gene.  That was a good movie.  I thought, and it's all good-natured, back and forth.  But, you know, underlying there is just this,  Fuck you.  Shut up.  I hate you.  Great stuff.  Well, in general, you don't like a person that has a different opinion than you.  Is that it?  So you think it's bubbling under the surface the whole time.  Just kind of bubbling.  When one of them says, you know, this movie's so good,  and the other one's like,  It's a piece of crap.  What are you talking about?  That's got to bother you inside.  Yeah, but it goes so much deeper with these guys. 
[03:08:30]  They're just, they don't like each other.  They honestly don't like each other.  We're redoing this because of your flub.  Now it's because of your flub.  Because of you.  But babies.  Yeah.  It's Thriller Week on Cisco and Ebert in the movies,  and we've got three new ones.  Dennis Quaid in the Big Easy.  Michael Caine in the Fourth Protocol.  And Kevin Costner and Gene Hackman in No Way Out.  That's this week on Cisco and Ebert and the movies. 
[03:09:00]  And the asshole.  Great.  That was great.  And that's Roger.  Oh, shit.  And the asshole.  And that's Roger.  Cisco and Ebert and the movies?  Why would they call it that?  He doesn't.  Is it at the movies?  It's supposed to be at the movies.  Cisco and Ebert at the movies.  Of course.  All right.  We've got a little more here.  The science fiction thriller RoboCop.  This week on Cisco and Ebert and the movies.  This week on Cisco and Ebert and the movies,  the science fiction adventure RoboCop. 
[03:09:30]  Let's do that again.  Very funny, Donna.  And you're my friend.  That's the last time you'll ever enter my home.  You know that for Gene,  speech is a second language.  Roger's first language is,  yes, I'll have apple pie with my order.  He.  Now they just get into a little tip.  Yeah.  Language.  Roger's first language is, 
[03:10:00]  yes, I'll have apple pie with my order.  He asked the McDonald's girls  if he can have apple pie with their order  before they ask him.  And you know what Gene says  when he goes into McDonald's?  Can I have apple with their order?  Roger is the only guy in the history  to ever answer yes to every question  he's asked at McDonald's.  Want some salad with your apple pie?  Want some french fries with your salad?  Want some hamburger with your french fries? 
[03:10:30]  Want some shake with your...  Want some shake?  Want some shake?  I knew Gene...  Anything.  I knew Gene couldn't sustain that string for long  without a grammatical error.  I don't know how many items there are,  but they've worked him through  the whole fucking menu.  Gene was in there the other day.  Gene was in the other day.  He set a record.  He ordered every fucking thing they have.  He ordered a cone and a sundae.  Now the other day,  Gene was in there  and the little girl said to him,  would you like some french fries  with your order?  Or Gene's answer was,  no, maybe other, other.  Up, up.  Dude.  Ah, yeah.  No. 
[03:11:00]  Never mind.  Never mind.  And then he walked out.  Oh, you know what they said?  They saw Roger walking in,  and they said,  one of everything to go,  and one of everything to stay here.  When they saw Gene walking in,  the little kid behind the counter  called for the manager and said,  Mr. Jones, can you come out here?  You can understand Mr. Siskel, can't you?  I can't ever understand anyone he's ordering.  That didn't sound good. 
[03:11:30]  No.  That's an old tumor.  I thought the same thing  when he was coughing.  I go, uh-oh.  That's not good.  God damn.  That is funny.  All right.  All right.  What will you have, sir?  That's foreshadowing right there.  That's the Don Corleone 
[03:12:00]  in the garden cough.  You're spilling my brain.  Death rattle.  Gravity made a plant and fall over, movie critic.  All right.  What will you have, sir?  Quarter.  Quarter.  Pound or quarter?  Pound or quarter? 
[03:12:30]  Pound or quarter?  Pound or quarter?  Quarter, pounder.  Cheese.  No cheese.  Cheese.  No cheese.  They ask Roger, do you want cheese with your cheeseburger?  He says, yes.  Shake milk.  Shake milk.  What?  Jesus.  Way to rip.  This is awful.  His sisal stinks.  His brain is smoking at this point, trying to fight the tumor, trying to ad-lib.  Apparently he had funny bone cancer.  Shake milk, shake milk, shake milk. 
[03:13:00]  Shake milk, shake milk.  Oh, jeez, that don't sound good.  What would you like, he goes to Burger King, what would you like on it, sir?  The following.  Then he asks Roger what they have.  I'll have the following.  And another thing.  And another thing.  Pickle.  Then he asks Roger what they have on his burger.  He says, salad, cherry pie, and a Coke.  On the burger.  With all due respect. 
[03:13:30]  He's getting trounced.  With all due respect.  By the fat one.  I know.  Come on.  Let's do this.  I only have one more to do this.  There we go.  This week on Siskel and Ebert in the movies, the science fiction adventure RoboCop.  Then they just go into the promo.  We got one more clip from Siskel and Ebert.  A lot of burger jokes, these two hacks.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, they were cracking everyone up on set, though.  Oh, that awkwardness, because they're like, shitting on each other.  And this fat fuck, he orders everything. 
[03:14:00]  I have a headache.  And when Roger orders a burger, he wants one of everything.  Yeah, when Siskel orders a burger, he wants to drain clogged with hair.  Shame, shame, shame, shame, shame on you.  Oh, clogged rain.  Jesus. 
[03:14:30]  All right, here we go.  He said Dewar, of course.  Dewar's great.  That's his favorite band.  That's because that's what that whole goddamn culture drinks to death.  All those wasps.  Wasps?  You know, they don't get enough shit, basically, wasps.  They don't.  They don't.  They're called yuppies now.  They run the goddamn country, and all of us, all of our...  I'm speaking to everyone who's eavesdropping right now.  All of us...  They don't run the whole goddamn country, Gene. 
[03:15:00]  What about the international bankers?  Oh, yeah.  Not to mention the Vatican.  No, no, no.  I'm talking about they run...  And the commies.  No, no, no.  They run the country.  The wasps run the country, and all of us should band together and overthrow them, and there could be...  You probably think our president is a wasp.  You think our president is a wasp, don't you?  No, he's not a wasp.  He isn't because he's Irish, so he's Celtic.  You know that...  Yeah, but you know what I'm talking about.  They're all Protestants. 
[03:15:30]  They've all been Protestants.  Okay, we have to do this again.  Come on, band together, people.  Let's overthrow the country.  Protestants, people who sort of want a religion.  Let's stick together.  I know.  The Catholics and the fucking Jews, we go back a few years together.  Come on.  Hey, listen.  We're real.  We're real.  We get down and get dirty.  Listen, we were burning each other when Martin Luther was only a gleam in his mother's eye.  I'll take a Baptist.  I'll take a Baptist.  I go back 6,000 years.  I want a Baptist.  Somebody that has some goddamn passion, some blood coursing through their veins.  Case closed.  Anything.  Right. 
[03:16:00]  Goddamn Protestants.  The biggest thing that happens for them on Sunday is a bake sale.  No, they've got to decide what color yellow to tie to fucking buy.  That's right.  Okay, gentlemen.  He's right.  Gee, what should it be, lime green or dark green today, honey?  Right, the only fucking religion that has the Reader's Digest is a prayer book.  Wow.  They don't get enough shit, and they have all the money.  They have all the money.  The only last thing...  All those guys, they're all running Northern Trust. 
[03:16:30]  They have all the banks on the South Street.  It's all horseshit.  The only time Protestants get on their knees is to adjust the fucking TV set.  They have all the goddamn insurance companies.  They have all the insurance companies.  They run the government.  They run everything.  You're right.  Okay, tape is rolling, and here we go.  Stand by, please.  Stand by.  Here we go.  Steve Martin's new comedy, Roxanne.  This week on Siskel and Ebert and the movies.  You said it a little too fast.  No, I think we were too long. 
[03:17:00]  That was four seconds.  We were, yeah.  Well, then it's going to have to be Siskel and Ebert.  Back it up a little bit.  Back up, sir.  Stand by.  Steve Martin and Roxanne.  New comedy, I think you're saying.  Steve Martin's new comedy.  Oh, fuck.  Now, get your energy up.  Here we go.  Steve Martin's new comedy, Roxanne.  I already shot my wad on the Protestants.  And there you have it.  Sounded like he was talking about the Jews.  Protestants. 
[03:17:30]  Protestants.  Thank God, man.  It was like watching Voss try to argue intelligently.  Oh.  Like, you know Voss is in trouble when that little stiff hand comes out?  Like, he's trying to, like, hush you so he can get his thoughts together?  Yeah.  Um.  The little balloon animal hand.  Oh, it's just awful.  You want to just hug him.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  We're going to play a bit about, uh, this fat Polish chick.  Yeah?  Oh, I remember this.  This girl came in and she was claiming to be a model and her pictures online were unbelievable. 
[03:18:00]  And then I was the only one.  The only one.  I wasn't in for this.  That, uh, called her out on, on the fact that she looked a lot different in person and  and she was a lot chubbier and stuff and that the camera guy had great technique to make  her look as hot as, uh, as she was on the internet.  And I was uncomfortable with the whole thing, so I was playing good cop.  And, uh, you know, uh, here's a game you can play at home.  Uh-huh.  Bet your friends whether she cries or not.  All right.  Bet them right now.  Will this girl cry by the end of this bit? 
[03:18:30]  The worst of O.B. and Anthony.  Did you guys have some girls show up today?  Uh, there were supposed to be six.  There's one pig out there.  There's one girl.  Oh, my God.  That's been, uh.  She looks like six.  Isn't that sound on?  Yeah, of course it is.  See?  She's making the face now.  That was, look.  I'm sure you're lovely when you're naked.  You don't need the makeup.  Trust me.  She's been putting on makeup for the last hour like we're going to look at her face.  Is she awful?  She's terrible.  No, she's, she, uh, she's, uh, she's, uh.  Oh, my God.  Now she's pulling her sweatshirt up over her head.  Are you going by your standards or by normal people? 
[03:19:00]  She has a good question.  She should bring her in.  She's going to fly.  No, now she's not going to do anything.  And now she's.  You ruined everything.  And now she's, uh, yeah, she has put the hood on her, on her head.  Opie, you wrecked it.  She is now folding her arms in front of her.  First of all, I have no idea what this girl looks like.  I can't even see.  She's wearing too much clothing.  What's her name?  Do you know?  She's got lovely blonde hair.  Victim.  Opie, you're being very mean.  Well, we'll get her to flash at least.  I'm not going in there now. 
[03:19:30]  You can read her lips.  I'm not going.  Now she has her hand on her head.  I'll bring, Kelly is sorry.  Come on, come on in.  Don't be shy.  He's only kidding.  Vito, come on in.  Come on in.  But, Jimmy, we had so much fun.  It was hilarious.  It really was funny.  Yeah, I wish I would have.  And half the time we couldn't even go to the radio station because they were either playing  music or commercials.  And one guy, they may wear a dunce hat on the highway because he lost a bet.  Ew.  Don't be stupid.  That's a little crazy, though.  Yeah, the dunce hat.  We got a good taste of what's going on in Radioland today. 
[03:20:00]  Dude, and again, it's so weird to have to edit now.  I really, it's ruined me for commercial radio these last few months.  Really?  Yeah, I don't want to do it anymore.  I mean, I'll do it to guys I like.  Like, you know, Sarah and No Name in San Francisco and a few other places.  Wait, wait, we're going to get a flash.  Okay.  Oh, hey.  Oh, wow.  See, you smartass.  All right.  Those are really, really nice.  Now she's bowing.  She's back in the game.  Wait, does she have headphones on?  No.  Miss, put her on.  I want to talk to her.  All right.  Jimmy wants to talk. 
[03:20:30]  Have her come in.  Come in here.  No, and I wouldn't be real picky and choosy about what radio stations you're doing.  We've seen some of your numbers on the road.  You've got to do them all.  These are actually so good here.  But don't the clubs say you've got to do them?  She's very cute.  She is kind of cute.  And she's got a really nice body and everything.  I don't understand what you're talking about.  No, you look much cuter in person than through that stupid, like, eight-inch glass, whatever  this damn thing is.  You're looking through.  What's your name?  Tiana.  Tiana.  We have Jim Norton on the phone.  He wants to say hi to you.  Hi, Tiana.  Jimmy wants you to talk to him, but without your sweatshirt on. 
[03:21:00]  Is that possible?  Is it too cold in here?  Yeah.  Hold on, Jimmy.  She's going to do what you want, and she's going to take her shirt off.  Are you going to kill herself?  She's all right.  She's like a seven on a Tuesday.  On a Friday, she's maybe a four.  What?  You're insane.  Look at her without her shirt on.  Let me see without her shirt.  This is, look.  Wow, she's got, wow.  No, she's, she.  What does she do?  What do you do?  Are you a porno?  What do you do?  Are you a porno?  Look at those.  She's got really nice, real boobs. 
[03:21:30]  She's got nice breasts.  Very nice.  Very nice.  She's blonde.  What color?  What color are you?  All right.  Hi.  What do you do?  Are you a dancer?  No, I'm a model and a photographer.  You're a model?  A little chubby, but besides that, she's pretty good.  A radio model?  I want to put the headphones on.  Yeah, you got to get, Jimmy's trying to talk to you.  Oh, headphones.  Yeah.  Headphones.  Wow, she got very, very nice natural boobs.  Is this your boyfriend right here?  No.  That's it.  That's icky or something like that.  I had a hard time living that icky shit down. 
[03:22:00]  All right.  Shut up.  You still look like a serial killer.  Relax.  What a mess.  Jimmy.  Hi.  She's got nice tits.  What's your name, miss?  Tiana.  Are you topless?  Yes, I am.  Ooh.  Would you object to showing your meat curtains?  Yes, definitely.  Why?  Would you show them?  Wrong kind of model.  Really?  Oh, you're wearing panties?  No.  You don't wear panties?  What kind of modeling do you do?  I do fine art and glamour nudes. 
[03:22:30]  Glamour nudes?  Those are like the artistic black and white ones?  No, glamour ones are like the cheesy ones of the girl in the Santa hat, like smiling.  Miss, can you speak up a little bit?  Yes.  I can't.  Now I can hardly hear at all.  She's very soft-spoken.  Oh, is she?  Yeah.  She really didn't say much of anything anyway, Jimmy.  No, I think you're very soft-spoken.  I'd rather hear the boyfriend piping in.  Hey, Rich, that was very hurtful what you said about my numbers on the road.  No, I'm only kidding.  You're doing great.  You just brought that up?  What I was trying to say was, don't the clubs make you do certain stations? 
[03:23:00]  Dude, do you know how?  Look, I was very depressed.  When the Borgata went on sale, it took four hours to sell out.  I was hoping it would go in the first hour.  And I don't need that rubbed in my face.  First of all, you're doing great.  Everybody knows.  And plus, you're going to blow up after April.  Everyone's trying to talk, but they're looking at her breasts.  Your breasts are very lovely.  When you do these modeling things, do they make sure they say a no-pigment body, like, with no color? 
[03:23:30]  Yeah, she's got alabaster skin.  Yeah, she does.  It's very lovely.  Well, I don't know.  I get a lot of work just for being natural.  You do?  Yeah.  Because I have, like, a very natural, like, soft, curvy body.  Curvy?  So most of the stuff that I do is, like, it works with the pale skin, I guess.  Are you about a size 14?  No, she's not a plus.  Oh, God.  She's a...  You're not, like, going to cry or anything.  You're not one of these people that can't take you. 
[03:24:00]  No, no, I'm okay.  You're pretty tough.  Where are you from?  I'm from Poland.  Oh, Poland.  Oh, really?  Does she know what show she's on?  Do you know what radio show you're on?  Yes.  Huh?  Yes.  Would you?  Would you?  Are you about a size 14?  Would you?  So you're kind of modeling against your will.  Is that what you're saying?  They're making you do this?  What?  Can I...  Oh, you know, she came over from...  Do you know how awful it is a comedian with a Polish joke bombs? 
[03:24:30]  Do you understand how awful that is?  What's that?  I did a Polish joke, and it went right into the toilet.  And I just...  As a comic, for a Polish joke to go down, you really got to fucking...  Well, you know what?  Maybe it was good.  Why don't you do it again?  Because we were just listening to...  We weren't even listening because we were looking at our breasts.  Okay.  Hey, miss, I look like Lech Walesa.  Can I teabag you?  Yeah.  That's good.  Make a nice 1980 reference.  1980s Polish reference.  Dude, I can't hear anything. 
[03:25:00]  Really?  I mean, I can hear you, but it's like listening underwater.  Yeah.  Can they fix these fucking phones?  Well, Jimmy, we're underwater today.  It's the underwater show.  It's underwater Friday.  We've submerged ourselves here in the studio.  We're going to have a couple of listeners come in and put on scuba gear.  We're Boiling Eggs Radio.  Look at those tits on there.  They're great.  Amazing.  Very nice.  But that's all we're going to get out of her, so let's just cut our losses.  What do you mean, she's not going to show any box?  She'll show?  She doesn't do that.  Why? 
[03:25:30]  What do you mean she doesn't do that?  Can we see her butt?  Yes.  Let's see.  She's got pretty eyes, too.  Oh, shut up.  Who cares about her eyes?  I'm just saying it to my girlfriend.  Oh, look.  Yeah.  Steve C., take a picture of that and email it to me, please.  Nice and round.  What's nice and round?  Her butt.  How about her vagina?  We haven't seen that.  We can just show it already.  I think the guys in the booth saw it.  Oh, they're giving thumbs up.  Why don't you show those guys your butt?  Good call, Anthony.  I think they saw it.  Not your butt.  Let me see the butt.  Show them your butt.  The guy's in the engineer booth. 
[03:26:00]  And, you know.  All right.  What a dummy.  Wow, that works perfectly.  You are Polish.  That works perfectly.  What a dummy.  I thought that was too obvious to actually have it work.  Thank you.  How does it look?  It looks great.  It's blonde.  I know.  And it's shaved into a wide mohawk.  The look doesn't match the smell.  It's so weird.  It's nice.  Anthony.  Wait, Jim.  I've got to stop the program to just tell everyone how brilliant Anthony really is. 
[03:26:30]  Thank you.  Can you explain what you just did?  Because I didn't have it.  I'm not that smart.  Well, I wanted to see her butt.  And she showed me her butt.  And our production facility studio through the glass is right across from me.  So, as I'm looking at her butt, the guys in there were looking at her pussy.  Right.  And, of course, she said she would not show that.  She wasn't going to show it, but she had just shown everyone in the booth.  I'm not going to, like, spread open.  No, we don't like the spread open.  I don't mind being naked in general.  Oh, just pull your pants out. 
[03:27:00]  We don't want spread open.  We don't even like that.  Yes, we do.  I just want to see what it looks like, like shaved.  See if it's – let's see what the shave is.  No, it's wispy.  Look at it.  Wow, it's blonde.  Is it fat though?  It is.  It's very nice.  Yeah, you would definitely appreciate it.  It looks like a chimp's mouth.  Oh, Miss, can I have a picture?  You would appreciate it.  Miss, can I have a picture of that, please?  Is anyone snapping away over there?  Please.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Don't worry about it.  No, it's very nice.  I shouldn't make fun of you.  Lots of pictures.  She's beautiful. 
[03:27:30]  You're very nice.  You're very nice, natural body on you.  How old are you, though?  Nothing wrong with that.  19.  All right, here's the problem.  All of a sudden, she just got 1,000 times better.  Here's the problem.  You do have that nice baby fat on you.  You're 19.  It's working for you.  Trust me.  Fast forward five years, you're going to be a mess unless you start taking care of  it now.  Jesus, Opie.  Way to keep the mood going, Opie.  Yeah, nice.  Thanks.  Boss, am I wrong?  Listen, I didn't want to bring it up.  Am I wrong?  No, not at all.  Right now, it's working for you.  I'm not going to lie to you.  Yeah, she doesn't lay you down. 
[03:28:00]  It probably flattens out.  You have that chubby youth right now.  She can lose it in no time.  She can go from like a six to a nine.  She's soft like a fresh Easter pea.  You can tell she is soft.  Yes, Jimmy?  It's a bad move when you have a girl in the studio to tell her that you're nice now, but  you're merging onto pig highway.  There's no reason to say that.  Well, someone has to say it because you know what?  I think if she just realizes that now, I think she'll be just fine in five years.  That's all I'm saying, right?  She wants to kill me. 
[03:28:30]  I love this.  There is nothing wrong with her.  She wants to kill me.  She's staring right through me, Jimmy.  Really?  Right through me.  I see nothing wrong with her.  I didn't say there's anything wrong with her now.  We're talking about the future.  You can't get pissed at the future.  You were in high school when?  I graduated when I was 16.  16?  So you're a smart one.  How was that?  Was it from a Polish high school?  No.  Oh, okay.  She's got a Rebecca, what's her name?  DeMornay.  DeMornay, a little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit, right?  Do people tell you you look like a celebrity?  No.  At all?  No?  Well, according to Opie, maybe Roseanne? 
[03:29:00]  No.  She's not that bad.  Do you support yourself with your modeling work?  Really?  It pays for everything, so you get a lot of work.  Is this your photographer?  You just don't understand.  That's Uncle Icky.  But what does she do?  Does she do massage?  What do you think he does?  I don't know what the relationship is here.  Have you done magazines?  What type of magazines would you do?  I haven't really done magazine work.  No?  I've done a lot of catalogs and stuff like that.  Catalogs for what?  Most of the stuff I do is just photographers hiring me to make their books better.  Portfolio and stuff? 
[03:29:30]  And that's why he is following you around like a stalker?  How long has he been stalking you?  Since yesterday.  Since yesterday?  And how did you get in touch with him?  He found me on a website I'm on.  Is he trying to bang you?  I hope not.  I'm trying.  Is he hoping not?  And he's going to pay you now.  He's a scary one, right?  Which one is that?  It's Icky.  Uncle Icky or something like that.  Uncle Icky.  He's got a fire truck for Adam Walsh in his pocket.  Exactly.  Yeah.  There's something going on.  I don't know what it is. 
[03:30:00]  Does she do massage?  Do you massage?  No.  No.  She's a pretty straightforward girl.  I don't think there's much smut in your life.  Smut free.  Yeah.  Would you do like that?  That's the modeling naked thing.  Yeah, but no porno, right?  You haven't had sex on film or anything like that?  No sex on film.  Would you do a female?  Have you had sex?  Are you sexually active since you graduated high school or before that?  Before that.  Wow, really?  When did you start?  14.  14.  Oh, Jesus.  That is.  How old was he?  Great.  How old was the guy? 
[03:30:30]  You don't want to know.  No, we want to know.  How old was the guy?  It was Uncle Icky.  Icky?  No.  It's Poland, so it's okay.  How old was he?  They have different laws there.  How old?  I'm really not going to answer.  Come on.  Was he in his 30s?  No.  20s?  Yes.  Okay.  Late 20s.  Oh, he's got a rod.  Late 20s, 14-year-old girl, very tender and innocent, young.  How'd it go down?  Did you have that chest on you at 14?  No.  No?  They were still growing?  They were just little buds. 
[03:31:00]  Lovely Polish girl can go for some pudding.  That's great, huh?  Yeah.  How fantastic.  That's good.  We play a little game here called, uh, oh, fuck, I forgot.  You certainly did screw that up.  She probably looked like the girl.  Oh, and now he's spilling stuff all over the console.  She probably looked like the girl from, what was the album cover, Blind Faith?  Blind Faith?  Yeah.  Because she's kind of got that look already.  Yeah.  No, that's good stuff.  How did it go down with the guy in his 20s? 
[03:31:30]  Yeah, what did he do?  How did he get you?  Um, I don't know.  You don't remember Halloween?  Did he come in here, your mother's away?  It was your first time.  Was it at your house?  No.  Where was it?  What place?  A car?  Was it a car?  I really don't remember.  What did he say?  He helped me with your homework for a month or something?  He's a family friend.  Oh, let's, no, let's get to the beginning of it.  Was it against your will or was it?  Oh, okay.  Figured we were.  Oh, that's her picture right there on the website.  Wow. 
[03:32:00]  Wow.  That's a really, that's you, huh?  Oh, me.  That's all ours.  How did it get you so thin?  Jesus, Opie.  Turn that ass.  What?  How many years ago is that taken?  I'm not even kidding.  You're beautiful in these pictures.  She's 19.  Where is she?  It was taken when she was 12, Opie.  Ooh.  Ooh, listen to Jimmy.  Wait a minute.  You know, you guys listen to me.  Yeah, I'm listening.  Go back.  Yes.  I mean, you're beautiful, obviously. 
[03:32:30]  That's, a lot of girls go through phases where they're thinner or heavier.  They fluctuate in weight.  It doesn't mean she's, you know, emaciated over here and fat over here.  How do I find her?  But these pictures were taken Monday, uh, 7th, so May, June, July.  July 26th.  Maybe she's bloating right now.  What?  July 26th.  Are you pregnant?  No.  Jesus.  Guys.  Guys.  It's been inappropriate.  How do I find her?  Uh, online.  Go to that and, and.  Put a cock on her.  You'll have no problem finding her. 
[03:33:00]  Search for, uh.  Hi, Daddy.  Hi, Daddy.  Wait, what, what, what, where can I find her?  Oh, you're online right now?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Uh, Tiana.  T-I-A-N-A.  Tell us when you have it, Jimmy.  Okay, hold on.  Wow.  That's hot.  I'm with another chick right there.  You take, uh, just a mean photograph, man.  Thank you.  Well, it's really slow opening now.  Oh, really?  Well, everyone's there.  Everyone's going to it.  I just want people to know that, uh. 
[03:33:30]  Mega hits.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Yeah, and then you could call Opie on this whole thing.  Oh, wait a minute.  It's a girl lunatic.  Boss.  Look at that.  Is that the same girl?  No, not at all.  Of course it is.  I mean, it's the same girl, but is it the same shape?  Turner, you can airbrush a picture.  Don't get me wrong.  She's good looking.  She's a cute girl.  Look at her on her bicycle.  You can see.  I like the bicycle picture.  I know what Opie's saying.  I love the photos.  I'm not even lying.  They're great photos.  They're unbelievable.  You take a really nice erotic photograph.  They're amazing.  Where's the naked ones?  They're all over the place. 
[03:34:00]  Look at that.  That's the same.  Dude.  Do they have any box pictures?  Dude, what are you doing?  What are you talking about?  You're beautiful in these pictures.  And?  But why were you saying before that she looks like a pig?  Dude, she's chubbier than these pictures.  And she has an unbelievable body in these pictures.  That's all I'm saying.  Has your weight fluctuated?  Does your weight fluctuate at all?  No.  It's camera angles.  It's camera angles.  That's what?  Knowing how to model.  See, she knows her business.  You really do know how to model.  I'll tell you.  Hey, Fatso, how long ago did you take these? 
[03:34:30]  Oh, Jesus.  She's not fat.  She's a cute girl.  In person, she just looks a little chubby.  Her boobs are beautiful.  Her face is beautiful.  I'm not trying to be a dick.  But I'm telling you, these photos are amazing.  Yeah, don't start trying to be a dick.  These photos are amazing.  Wow, there you go.  Look at her.  She's in the shower.  That looks like the psycho scene.  Her bosom up against the...  Wow.  Looks like she's getting ready to get stabbed.  Yeah, it looks like a scene from Psycho, actually.  I bet you Uncle Icky loves taking her pictures, dirty boy.  Yeah, he's taking them now. 
[03:35:00]  He is a filthy animal.  Uncle Icky is a sleazy man.  Have you seen the pictures?  Yeah, I'm looking at them right now.  What do you think?  I can't believe that...  Well, off the air, I mean, you were saying that she's a real fatty in person,  and I can't believe, looking at these pictures, that she's fat.  She is not fat.  No, no, no.  Ope was saying that to me off the air.  Wow.  Wow, that's nice right there.  I can handle the pressure.  She's beautiful.  Look at that picture.  She's got stomach muscles there.  Look how beautiful she is.  Right? 
[03:35:30]  How tall are you?  5'7 1⁄2".  5'7 1⁄2".  Wow.  Can I ask you how much you weigh?  140.  Right now?  Mm-hmm.  Right, girls always drop at 10 pounds.  So, all right, 5'7 1⁄2", 150.  Right.  Jimmy.  I want to scale.  Do you hate him?  Do you hate him?  Yeah, yeah.  Why do you hate me?  No, she hates me.  But you're right in there, too.  Well, dude, don't tell her this.  But I remember, off the air, you were saying she's kind of piggish in person.  I mean, just, you know, I mean, obviously, she's really hot. 
[03:36:00]  Why would you say that, dude?  She's solid.  I will prove I can take this.  Look at that.  Look at that one.  Look at that picture.  The pictures are stunning.  Dude, do not tell her I'm saying this, because she's really pretty.  But, like, what did she walk in wearing that you were like, ugh, what a slob?  No, she had a sweatshirt on, a hooded sweatshirt, and it was very baggy and stuff, and you really  couldn't tell what she looked like.  But she took that off, and she's beautiful.  She's a lovely girl.  Yeah.  I just, it's tough to sit here, because she seems like she could cry, but, you know, she's  from Poland, so you've dealt with tougher stuff than this fucking idiot over here, right? 
[03:36:30]  Dude, look at this picture and tell me it's the same person.  That's all I'm saying.  It is.  It's the way they model.  No, I understand.  Yeah, but still.  The photographer.  She had tough abs back then.  When was that taken?  About three years ago?  I don't know.  They're all dated, actually.  Oh, yeah?  Each one next to it says the year and the month.  Yeah, they're dated, Rich.  Rich.  This guy's the Ansel Adams of nudes, I'll tell you.  Ansel Adams.  Nice reference.  He was the only photographer I could think of. 
[03:37:00]  I'm so glad that guy's not working behind me anymore.  Yeah, he really is a creep.  Does he, do you know him?  Wow.  Does he come here a lot or something?  Is that blue eyes?  Because I see, I can't tell in real life, but in that picture, they're just like, wah.  Very nice.  You must make good money doing this, huh?  Now you see why she gets paid and is able to support herself with her modeling.  Very good.  Oh, look at that resume.  What are you going to do with these, Inky?  What are you doing with these pictures?  Once again, I'm here.  Get on mic over there if you could, please.  Look, I know there's going to be a whole discussion about this after we get off the air. 
[03:37:30]  We took a couple snapshots, right?  Yeah.  All right, I want those on the website next to the photo she's got on her website.  That's all I'm saying.  Hey, that beach one, go there.  Yeah, these pictures that I'm taking today, I'm giving to you guys for Found Your Music,  whatever you use them.  Oh, okay.  I'm trying to set up a shoot for her.  See, you can tell she's the same girl right there, but that looks really, really hot.  Uncle Icky.  It's just the way it's photographed.  All right.  Very, very good.  Bravo.  Good job.  Don't try to clap and make her feel better if you're humiliated.  Shut up.  She's a tough girl. 
[03:38:00]  She's from Poland.  Stop giving my secrets away, you ask.  Are you from Poland?  Are you actually from Poland?  Originally from Poland.  When did you leave Poland?  When you were one?  All right, I'll try that one.  So you're American, really.  Okay.  All right, Tiana, we're going to let you be.  Didn't think you were walking around the streets of Poland with like a babushka on your  head and stuff like that.  No.  No, you left there when you were one.  You guys, let's let Tiana be, all right?  All right, Tiana, thank you very much.  Thank you.  She's a lovely girl.  Icky, thank you.  My pleasure.  Look at that. 
[03:38:30]  See?  She's a very lovely girl.  19.  I hope she turns her life around.  She's doing very well for herself.  She's still here, Mitch.  She's putting her shirt on.  Look at that.  You got a bumper sticker.  Oh, wow.  He's a great...  Smile, smile, smile.  Even though you hate us.  She don't hate us.  One more.  Put the sticker down a little.  There you go.  You don't want to cover those things.  When you get into his car, don't be worried that there's no door handles on the inside. 
[03:39:00]  Yeah.  And the shovel, duct tape, and tarpaulin is all part of the photography thing.  Uncle Wickey.  And if he tells you he used to play with a Grateful Dead, he's lying.  All right?  He really is a guy.  He has all his fingers.  It goes human hunting in the woods.  Like, he'll put an orange hat on her to make it easier.  Make her run naked through the Pacific Northwest while he shoots at her.  Thank you very much.  Sport about you.  She's a very nice girl.  There you go.  Yeah, I like Tiana.  Uncle Wickey, Inky.  I hope she's not upset.  It's Inky.  It's not Icky.  All right. 
[03:39:30]  We brought you Serena the last time.  Serena.  Oh, yeah.  And what shallow grave does she reside in now?  Yeah, absolutely.  Honestly, she's...  I have not heard much of her.  Shut up.  Shut up.  No one cares.  I know.  Do you say we because you're so big?  Do you say we because you're a big guy?  Or do you have a company?  What do you mean by we?  Well, me and my partner.  Hey, thanks, guys.  Mikes are optional.  Yeah, I'm sorry, guys.  Guys, take it easy.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Have a great day.  Thanks.  All right.  All right.  And there they go.  You are so mean.  All right.  No, he's right. 
[03:40:00]  You are so mean.  All right.  Now, pussy.  Now, tell it like it is now that she's not here.  What a lovely girl.  No.  Dude, stop.  She's beautiful, but...  But?  But photography is a wonderful profession.  Be honest, Anthony.  Some people are very good at it.  I know we're doing a little good cop, bad cop here, but be honest.  I think...  She's still lovely and all that, but what we saw live and the photographs on this website  is like night and day.  Not night and day.  Night and day.  See, that's where I have the argument.  It's not night and day.  I would almost say that the girl... 
[03:40:30]  It's dusk and early evening.  I would almost say the girl in those pictures we saw...  Yeah.  I would say she's a 10.  Yeah, in those pictures.  The girl we saw...  She's 10 pounds of...  Seven, six and a half.  But that's life.  That's every hot celebrity you ever see.  If you see them in real life, they do not look like they do in their pictures.  It's what they do with...  Dude, that picture right there.  Yeah.  Compared to what we saw.  You can tell it's the same girl.  Oh, yeah.  I know it's the same girl.  Yeah. 
[03:41:00]  It's the way they photograph it.  I don't know if it was trick photography or what.  Trick photography.  Maybe that's a picture of a funhouse mirror or something.  Yeah, she was a lot...  I do notice you can see some ribs in her chest in that picture, which you probably didn't  see in real life.  I don't know.  Maybe they add that in.  Let me see that picture right there that you were just pointing at.  Which one?  No, no.  That one.  Yeah.  Did she leave?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let me see that one.  You know, Jimmy, these guys just don't know how to be honest.  See, you can tell. 
[03:41:30]  You can tell.  She sucks it in.  Yeah.  She pulls in her stomach when the picture's being taken.  The way she's posed...  All right.  Her boobs are like the focus of attention.  Yep.  And her leg is up.  It's all the way she's posed and photographed.  But it's her.  I don't think there's any trickery being done.  Okay.  You know, they have very talented photographers and people that pose her and she knows how  to model.  Well...  She's got a natural beauty to it.  Look, I guarantee I will win this argument with the fans.  Guarantee it.  Well, who the hell's taking the pictures in here? 
[03:42:00]  I'm just saying, take some of the pictures we took in studio, match them up with what's  on the website, and let the listeners decide.  I have enough confidence in what I was saying.  That's all.  I agree.  I thought she was...  Because people, I guarantee right now, are looking at this website going, Ope, you're  absolutely insane.  This girl is a 10.  She's phenomenal and all that.  I'm telling you so.  There was a drastic drop-off.  Yeah.  She was 19.  She was...  She had...  It wasn't muscle.  It was rolls.  You know?  There was fatness.  It was sexy in a way.  Jimmy?  Yeah.  I want to see what her badge looks like. 
[03:42:30]  It was very nice.  It was very nice.  I like a nice fat Polish one.  Polish chicks are very sexy.  Rev from Wackbag says, is Cage her photographer?  From Wackbag, the guy that does all the Photoshop work.  Oh, very good.  By the way, I just got an IM from Ben Sparks, and it said, she is a pig.  You're not lying, right?  No, I swear to God.  Thank you.  Ben just IM me.  See, because no one can say it to their faces around here for some reason.  I can just see potential there, definitely.  Well, it wasn't about the potential. 
[03:43:00]  It was about, you know, the live girl and what the picture showed.  It was really different.  When she took her clothes off and there were no pig in there, I really thought that she  reminded me of Norton, though.  What did pig in there remind you of Norton?  As a female Norton.  She looked...  Female Norton.  That's what I was thinking, you know.  Jesus.  Raped at 14.  Her boobs were perfect.  Yeah, they were perfect.  Live and on the website, so.  She was a mess.  That's very hurtful that you're making fun of me.  I'm not making fun of you.  I'm your number one supporter the other day. 
[03:43:30]  What are you kidding me?  You're poking fun at my physical appearance.  No, you've lost weight.  You look good.  You don't smoke.  Everything's turning around.  All right.  Although, I did go into the dressing room at the stress factor last night.  I saw that poster that you have in your CD.  Oh, yeah.  It's so funny.  Thanks.  It's so...  He's sitting in...  I was at the photo shoot.  It's awful.  Oh, God.  How funny is that?  That was the most embarrassing thing I've ever been a part of.  Fucking funny.  All of a sudden, Jim's like, hey, I've got to get some photos done for my Yellow Discipline CD.  I'm like, yeah, I'll go.  It was down in Soho.  It was in a really nice place.  The photographer, that girl was so hot. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah, she was sexy, right?  And then, all of a sudden, Jim's like, well, I'm going to go get ready for my photographs.  At this point, I really don't know what he's doing.  I see yellow flowers or whatever, and the set is all set.  And all of a sudden, Jim comes walking out with his underwear on, completely pulled up  to his nipples, so his gut is just taking over his underwear.  And he's like, all right, I'm ready.  With a hat.  I start spitting up coffee, man.  Well, she had bought me those because she thought I could possibly look sexy. 
[03:44:30]  She wanted me to do, like, James Bond-type shows holding yellow roses.  And she bought me these Calvin Klein briefs.  I know what a pig I am.  I forgot about that.  That's right.  She wanted to dress you up in nice black clothes, whatever.  And you were like, no, I'll just wear the underwear.  Remember when you went on that audition, you said, for Calvin Klein in the waiting room?  It was like all tens.  All models, all male models, yeah.  All right, Steve, get to the microphone.  I am not going to lose this battle today.  What did you think of that girl?  Between the pictures on the website. 
[03:45:00]  Pictures on the website were exponentially better than what she was in person.  They were what?  Sorry.  Better.  Sorry, Jim.  I used a big word.  More gooder.  More gooder.  Jesus Christ.  She left crying?  Yeah.  No.  No.  Well, she left sweating.  The whole time she was in here, did you notice she had sweat running down her pits like you wouldn't believe?  Really?  That's turning me on.  I didn't see that.  I like that smell.  Well, she just got a huge plug for her site.  Twisted, Jimmy.  People will be checking out her pictures all weekend long.  It's very sexy sometimes. 
[03:45:30]  Yeah, we've been here before, haven't we?  All right.  You've talked about this.  Ron and Fez on XM 202.  Ron and Fez here, and our show is coming to XM 202 starting Monday, September 12th.  Just in time for back to school.  Last time you were in school, Roosevelt was president.  Oh, yeah, which Roosevelt?  Either one is an insult.  Oh, beauty.  Catch the Ron and Fez show weekdays, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. on the East Coast.  8 a.m. to 11 a.m. in the West, right after Opie and Anthony on XM 202.  It's a new deal. 
[03:46:00]  Ron and Fez.  And we're spent.  Hi, this is Adam Sessler.  And I'm Morgan Webb from G4, and here's another game break.  Need to fill out the old release schedule a bit?  Well, put out a retro collection.  That seems to be the only explanation for Sega Classics Collection.  A melting pot of 10 old-school Sega titles given three-dimensional facelift.  A handful of the games are still good.  Virtual Racing Flat Out is a straightforward port of the arcade game.  And Monaco GP is kind enough to offer a slightly tweaked version of the old game in addition to the newfangled 3D game. 
[03:46:30]  Graphics this bad wouldn't have been acceptable on the PS1 in 1996.  Congratulations, Sega Classics Collection.  You've turned one of my favorite arcade games of all time into the digital equivalent of a left hook to the eye socket.  A 2 out of 5.  That does it for this game break.  If you don't get G4, then call your cable or satellite provider and demand it. 
[03:47:00]  Hi, I'm Laszlo.  When wireless internet routers appeared, people nationwide began setting them up and sharing their internet connection.  Walking down the street in New York with a PDA or laptop, you'll see several wireless connections near you that allow you to access the internet.  Broadband providers have gotten nasty with customers who allow other people to access their wireless connection.  People who don't want to share their internet connection can simply change the security settings.  A man in Florida was driving down the street and detected a wireless internet connection. 
[03:47:30]  He stopped and was accessing the internet when the police arrived.  The homeowner saw him on his laptop and called the police.  He was charged under a Florida law that prohibits unauthorized access to a computer or network, which is a felony.  He could be in prison for several years.  If the homeowner didn't want to share his wireless internet connection, he should secure it.  For those that don't know how to secure their wireless network, there are now routers that will do it for you.  I'm L-A-Z-L-O-W dot com. 
[03:48:00]  That's what's on my underground hard drive.  Hey everybody, it's Stephen Lynch.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  And also, I have herpes.  Oh God.  Psycho Mark.  Used to work for the show.  Yep.  He got fired during one of our Sex for Sam thing.  Right.  Needless to say, he's not working for the show anymore.  I don't know what he's up to.  We really need to get him back on the show.  Last I heard, he was working at Fox News, but now I hear no.  I hear that he's been fired from a few jobs now.  Since then?  I think he lost his radio gig too. 
[03:48:30]  I'm not positive, but.  The radio, well, needless to say, he's unemployed.  Needless to say.  What was the radio gig that he had?  I honestly didn't know.  Alan Combs, he was helping out?  Needless to say.  Needless to say?  That's what he says like 800 times during the interview.  Needless to say?  Psycho Mark.  Needless to say.  Needless to say.  Then don't say it.  This was one of the funniest things that happened to us after we got fired.  Gave us a few chuckles in our chuckle-less life back then.  Watching Psycho Mark be an expert on the Opie and Anthony situation. 
[03:49:00]  Yeah.  In a suit that they lent him.  I didn't have many laughs when we were on hiatus, whatever you want to call it, but I  would pop up this video from time to time and just laugh like an idiot.  I really would.  Ben would call me.  I'd be in the middle of America somewhere and he goes, dude, have you watched the video  lately?  I'm like, no.  Watch a moron handle a news interview.  But this was the day we finally got to play the interview on the show and comment and it's  pretty funny, so check it out.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Did I just fart? 
[03:49:30]  We have to go backwards a little bit, but I forgot that we've never talked about this  on the show.  Oh, the Psycho Mark.  In our time off, though, we've been quoting lines from this thing over and over again to  each other, Ben thinks it's the funniest thing ever.  Oh, of course.  That was ever on TV.  And if you know Psycho Mark, unfortunately for the new listeners, they don't know who  Psycho Mark is yet.  Where is Psycho Mark these days?  He's being very responsible as he works for Fox.  Is he still at Fox?  Yes.  What does he do there?  Where's Ben? 
[03:50:00]  Ben would know.  See, now here we've got another guy who doesn't mind the U2.  That's the problem you get when you play music on your radio show.  We could play like Hank Williams Jr.  and there'll be a ton of people going, all right, now the boys are talking and then the  other people will turn us off.  So, you know, we understand that game when we go to music here and there.  Here comes Ben.  It was just by the water machine.  Oh, he's getting a little drink.  There he is.  Trying to water down his hair.  Keep it calm today.  Ben.  Yes.  We're going to play the Psycho Mark game.  That's hilarious.  This is hilarious. 
[03:50:30]  What is Psycho Mark doing these days?  He's producing Alan Combs' show with John Constantino.  Oh, is that what he does?  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, he's producing a radio show and he also still works cameraman at Fox.  No?  Fox and Friends are one of those shows.  But this is hilarious because he's naming cities.  You guys weren't even on it.  I remember when this happened, Opie called me and he's like, what the fuck is he doing?  Yeah, he's way out of, he's saying how he knows the leader of the Catholic League, how  he's a friend of his.  This was the first guy.  He just lost his mind.  Yeah.  This was the first guy that was even remotely involved with the show that was talking. 
[03:51:00]  This was, when did this air?  This was the day after.  This was the day after we got fired.  Well, cancel, whatever, yeah.  Yeah, cancel, fire, whatever.  It was a Friday.  It was a Friday morning because of the thing that happened on a Thursday.  So he was like the inside guy.  Well, because they were trying to get, you know, it was such a big thing, the Sex and  St. Pat's, that they were trying to get anyone on their air.  Yeah.  They wanted us, obviously.  They camped outside our residence for, I don't know, off and on for a couple weeks.  They wanted anybody involved with the show.  Anyone.  Steve, Rick, anybody. 
[03:51:30]  Ben.  Yeah, anyone that was even close.  Our agent.  People that worked for Viacom.  No one was talking.  No one was talking except Psycho Mark gave the exclusive interview to Fox and Friends.  And they even goof on him a little bit at the beginning because he's wearing a suit and  he never wears a suit.  He's like, they're goofing on the fact that he's clean and he's got to give the suit back  to the guy he borrowed it from.  Right.  I guess they pick him up.  He was a regular employee.  He would help us out, but he also worked for Fox and Friends.  So he was like just a regular scumbag over at Fox and Friends. 
[03:52:00]  But he had the exclusive on the biggest story of the day.  Yeah.  So they treated him like a superstar.  They made sure he had a suit.  They got, I think they even got him a limo that day to bring him to work.  Brushed his hair.  Brushed his hair and sat him down for the exclusive interview.  The inside scoop on Opie and Anthony.  Wonderful.  This thing has made us laugh for the last two years.  I don't know if you'll find it as funny as we do, but we'll stop it.  You got to also remember, especially the new listeners, this guy is out of his freaking  mind.  Oh yeah.  That's why he's called Psycho Mark.  But he was using his broadcast voice all of a sudden because this was a very serious 
[03:52:30]  day.  You ain't go for talking like this.  Let me tell you how fucked up we were last night.  Holy shit.  He'll talk about the collards in Boston with this really bad voice.  Yeah, the collards.  They love keeping them in their own fucking area up there in Boston.  And then he's like, hey, how are you doing, guys?  Right.  So.  I use the radio voice now.  Here's the audio.  We'll stop it.  Unfortunately for a couple of guys who are making millions of dollars a year, Opie and 
[03:53:00]  Anthony in New York City, they were fired yesterday after a couple was caught having  sex at St. Patrick's Cathedral, and it was all being broadcast on their radio show.  Joining us now with some exclusive details is a member of that cast, Mark Walsh, better  known as Opie and Anthony, on those Opie and Anthony listeners as Psycho Mark.  Hi, guys.  How are you?  Good.  Thanks for having me on.  Hi, guys.  Good to have me on.  How are you?  Thanks for having me on.  Like he's a general talking about the war.  Thanks for having me on. 
[03:53:30]  It's like Jim Cook.  And right after this interview, he went right behind the camera again and filmed Fox and  Fred.  Yeah.  Thanks for having me on.  Wasn't he miking people back then?  Oh, that's what he was.  That's what his job was.  He would put the little microphones on.  Thanks for having me on.  Before the interview.  On those Opie and Anthony listeners as Psycho Mark.  Hi, guys.  How are you?  Good.  Thanks for having me on.  Mark, it's a thrill to see you again, especially Clint.  Thrilled to see you again.  Thrilled to see you again.  Every day as he's miking the guest.  He works with you.  He works with you, you idiot.  That'd be like me going, hey, Jimmy. 
[03:54:00]  Thrilled to see you again.  Right.  Like, oh, he doesn't stop by very often, but good thing he's here today.  All kidding aside, and thanks for having me on.  Oh, no problem.  They're making it sound like he's their expert for things in the media.  Yeah.  You know, he comes on from time to time.  Good to see you again.  Like you said, the war correspondent.  Especially clean.  Yeah, exactly.  With a suit and everything.  I know.  I didn't know you.  I feel like a pundit, you know.  Give it back to John Scott at the end of the show.  That's part of the deal.  Fair deal.  But, Mark, let's talk seriously what happened.  Fred was the one, our producer here, to inform you about what happened. 
[03:54:30]  You've talked to Opie and Anthony since.  He did not.  He did not talk to us.  I'm going, Mark did not talk to me.  No.  Mark didn't talk to Anthony.  Uh-uh.  Anthony and I pretty much shut off our cell phones and went into hiding.  My own mom and dad didn't talk to me.  No one talked.  No one talked to us.  And Psycho Mark was not.  We were pretty damn depressed about losing our careers.  No one was talking to us.  Psycho Mark was not spoken to.  I didn't talk for a week, maybe two weeks.  Did you hear the first line?  I've memorized this thing.  It's so funny. 
[03:55:00]  What happened?  You've talked to Opie and Anthony since.  What's their feeling about getting the hands?  Well, it was a huge thing, needless to say.  I mean, needless to say, the entire stunt was a bad thing.  Psycho Mark.  Wow.  Adding some real new information there.  It was a bad thing.  This is a guy that held up the C word on live TV for us, but all of a sudden, he's going  to throw us out to dry there.  Well, it was a bad thing.  Whenever you use the term needless to say twice in a row, you have nothing to say after 
[03:55:30]  it.  Needless to say, needless to say.  I have nothing to say, nothing to say.  Let it be known, we've never said this, he was the guy that held up the C-U-N-T sign  on live TV.  Yeah, that was him, wasn't it?  Yes, it was.  Yeah, and he's also the guy that jumped on the front of the voyeur bus and hung onto the  windshield wipers as it drove down the street, pounding, let me in, let me in.  And bragging that he hid an ounce of pot somewhere on the bus, so they had to take the bus apart.  Like ants take apart a grasshopper. 
[03:56:00]  That's what they did to the voyeur bus, because Psycho Mark was bragging that he hid an ounce  on it.  Guys, they're arresting us right now.  Yeah, they're arresting us, but I hid my pot in one of the seats.  Gah, gah, gah, gah, gah.  They'll never fucking find me.  Oh, I gotta put on my smooth guy boy.  The cops are coming.  This is the same guy.  I mean, we love the guy, trust me.  Oh, don't get us wrong.  We love the guy.  This guy's a pisser.  He does great radio for us, but this thing is unbelievable.  To inform you about what happened, you've talked to Obi and Anthony since. 
[03:56:30]  What's their feeling about getting...  Well, it was a huge thing, needless to say.  I mean, needless to say, the entire stunt was a bad thing.  What happened was entirely wrong.  And the boys are very upset that it even happened.  The boys.  The boys are very upset.  The boys.  Oh, my God.  The boys.  It's like a father talking about his kids.  The boys are very upset with what happened.  Well, do it again.  Needless to say, I mean, it was needless to say a bad thing.  The entire stunt was entirely wrong.  It's like, geez, he's got four words he's saying. 
[03:57:00]  Oh, he's beyond nervous, though.  This is his big moment in the spotlight.  What I'm saying is needless.  Yeah, the boys are really...  They knew they had to get the papers.  Get the papers.  Needless to say, needless to say.  What I'm saying is needless to say.  Yeah.  And we're off to the park.  The boys are very upset.  I know.  I was going to say that.  It's hilarious.  Oh, the boys.  It happened.  What was at stake here was a trip to the Sam Adams plant up in Massachusetts.  And whoever got the most points would get the free trip, right?  Exactly.  And the way you get points is...  You go around town and the couples would engage in lewd acts, you know, in different places. 
[03:57:30]  All right, listen to me.  And I just remembered something.  Didn't he go with you that day?  What's that?  Yeah.  He followed you that day with your couple.  Yeah.  So he was actually in there.  So far, he's got the facts straight, though.  Except the fact that he talked to you.  The boys were upset.  Ah, right.  And the reason, by the way, needless to say, needless to say, that he's working at Fox anyway,  is because he got fired from his job at WNEW. 
[03:58:00]  And why did he get fired?  For the second annual Sex for Sam contest.  When he took his couple into our boss's office and made them have anal sex on the couch of our general manager  while our program director was looking through the glass door going,  like, no, don't do that.  And Psycho Mark spun his head around, looked at our program director, and said to his couple,  guys, go for it.  Yeah, live on the air.  What was the program director doing besides instructing the girl how to relax before she took a cock in her ass? 
[03:58:30]  Oh, Jesus.  You just won't let that go, that you didn't get your raise before you got fired.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Anyway, so this is who they have on Fox and Friends.  Yeah, here's their...  And he is our pal.  But I think it's just hilarious.  You know, in different places.  So they'd have sex in different places.  Exactly.  For points.  And then someone picked the St. Patrick's Cathedral, and even with a 40-second delay... 
[03:59:00]  Well, what happened before the show was, and it was explained to everybody that took part in the show,  do not go to St. Patrick's Cathedral.  That is a flat-out lie.  That's a lie, too.  We didn't even bring up the word St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Church was on the list.  Yeah.  We kind of told the people, you know, did we even tell them to steer clear of the churches?  I don't think we did.  No, not really.  I think it was on the list, but we assumed... 
[03:59:30]  We were going to control it from where we sat.  Yeah, we weren't going to...  Did a great job, didn't we?  We weren't going to take any calls from, like, a church, but...  Or if we did, we were going to, like, play it in a way that we would have probably saved our asses.  Yeah.  But when we plunked the phone line down and Paul Mercurio just said,  we're here at St. Pat's and they're doing the balloon knot, it was kind of too late.  No turning back.  Could have punched the dump button, though.  All right, here's...  Could have, should have, would have.  Here's more Psycho Mark.  Two of my favorite things are still coming up.  Somebody that took part in the show, do not go to St. Patrick's Cathedral. 
[04:00:00]  This was told to all the participants before we even went on air that day, okay?  Can I just jump in real quick?  I mean, any church, there was, like, 25 points that you could get for going into a church.  Wouldn't you just think any church would blow people's minds?  Most of the stuff that happens is, it's radio.  It's on air.  It's a description.  It's theater of the mind, so to speak.  So to speak.  He's an expert on radio.  Radio, it's theater of the mind, so to speak.  So to speak.  So you have a theater and a mind, neither of which I'm in possession of at this moment. 
[04:00:30]  What makes this funny, if you know Psycho Mark, like, we know.  What a tool.  I love it.  I love it.  How'd you guys get Rod Serling to do an interview on your behalf?  Pitiful portrait.  Exactly.  Of a dumped duo.  Exactly.  Submitted for your approval, Opie and Anthony.  So to speak.  In other words, those acts necessarily aren't really happening, but they are described as 
[04:01:00]  on the air.  Now, wait a minute.  What?  Those acts aren't necessarily happening, but they are as described on the air.  Described as on the air.  Described as on the air.  Yeah.  I don't know what I'm talking about.  He's doing gymnastics with the English language.  Exactly.  What is he trying to say here?  So to speak.  In other words, those acts necessarily aren't really happening, but they are described as  on the air.  Now, wait a minute.  Are you saying they didn't really have sex? 
[04:01:30]  Because the usher says the people were partially naked.  I'm not. </pre>
