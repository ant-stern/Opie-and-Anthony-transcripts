<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The "After Opie and Anthony Live" segment, featuring Sam Roberts, opened with a bombshell: Eric had been fired, the reasons shrouded in mystery following a poorly understood meeting.  The conversation quickly veered into Eric's obsessive autograph-seeking, detailing his successes (multiple photos with Rick Springfield) and failures (a seemingly dismissive encounter with Dennis Leary), all while Opie inexplicably threw blueberries.  This was followed by a discussion of threatening messages and angry texts from a listener, Bobo Chase, who had misinterpreted a tweet.  Bobo later called, apologized profusely, and offered Opie upgraded Mets tickets to make amends.

Opie took credit for booking UFC president Dana White as a guest via a tweet, prompting a demand for a cut of Roland's salary or ten vegetable juices as compensation.  The hosts then shifted to Anthony's raucous 4th of July party, detailing videos of Anthony with Daniel Craig at a shooting range, excessive alcohol consumption, and memorable moments like Eastside Dave's nude pool appearance and subsequent hot tub relaxation with Andy Levy.

The segment explored Opie and Anthony's potential exit from radio, citing dissatisfaction with the medium and discussions with Dennis Leary about television opportunities.  Speculation arose regarding a possible move to a new New York station, with Eric showing little enthusiasm.  A brief, passing discussion touched upon the possibility of a "Sat Rad" investigation into the Caylee Anthony case.  Throughout the chaotic broadcast, punctuated by off-color jokes and frequent interruptions, Ron Bennington made a brief cameo.  The overall tone was one of playful ribbing and banter, with the seemingly disparate topics connected by the show's characteristically irreverent and often crude humor.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Everybody's still in here.  Where are you going, Gary?  Getting away from you.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  Gary's whispering in Opie's ear right now.  Throw the mic over there. Let's listen.  What are they saying, Travis?  I can't tell you.  All right, you listen.  Okay, they're whispering.  The bed is quieting down.  It's about Eric. 
[00:00:30]  What are they saying about Eric?  Do six to eight here, and then eight to ten over there.  Where?  Eric can only do two hours.  Eric's only going to do two hours from now?  Eric, they're just saying, I think, I heard six to eight, eight to ten,  so I'm assuming, Eric, since you can't get in on time,  they're going to start letting you come in from eight to ten?  What's that?  That'd be great.  I mean, that does sound like a good deal, doesn't it?  Works for me.  Yeah, so we'll make sure you're going to do the event.  Yeah, that's fine.  Oh, I hear more words.  Well, you know my fee's a million dollars, 
[00:01:00]  so if you come up with a million dollars, no problem.  Wow, a million bucks.  Oh, hi, Sam.  A million dollars?  Who's that guy?  That's some guy with a beard, I don't know.  He's a mountain man.  Rick Rubin.  That's not Rick Rubin.  He looks like Rick Rubin.  Is that Rick Rubin?  It's not Rick Rubin.  Rick, why don't you interview Rick Rubin?  Because it's not Rick Rubin.  I mean, that's obvious.  What would Rick Rubin be doing here?  What else?  He's only a music producer. 
[00:01:30]  I mean, the mic, he, Gary's in a position where, you know,  he would like to not have this conversation with you with microphones on.  My mic's off, what?  Well, I mean, mine is still...  You don't have to call him a dummy.  My mic is still on.  I don't even know which mic I'm on.  That's why I'm on the radio.  They're going to...  Jim, they're having a meeting.  Except Obi won't refuse us to leave the studio for it. 
[00:02:00]  He just turned his mic off.  But you can still kind of hear the moment.  Travis, you're going to have a meeting with Jim?  Hold on, I'm just going to ask him something.  What are you going to ask him?  I missed the big meeting.  You got to turn more...  Are all the mics on you?  Oh, good.  What happened to the meeting?  Eric's fired.  Eric's fired.  Oh, good.  That's too bad.  Bad, bad, boo.  Give me one second.  Can we go home?  Can you let me leave?  Well, what happened in the meeting just now?  I'd like to know.  Yeah, Jim wasn't here.  What did this meeting do for me or to me?  That's a good point.  Am I hurting this meeting?  That's a great question.  Because I heard Jim's name come up once. 
[00:02:30]  I would love to tell you, but all I heard was white noise.  Well, Gary's still in the room.  He's right there.  Are you?  I want to know what was said in that meeting.  I'll tell you on the ride home.  It's not good.  Did it involve me?  Oh, yeah.  You're...  Was there positive things being said about me?  But Jim has really stepped up his game.  That's what the meeting was.  This Jim, he's been on fire lately.  We normally don't just give raises arbitrarily.  What happened?  But I would like...  Uh-oh. 
[00:03:00]  I'd like to think it was about me.  I'm getting some intel.  Hey, I'm going to get a...  Can I get Rick Springfield to sign my picture?  I don't see why not, Jim.  I mean, that should be priority number one.  He's doing...  He's doing Rana Fez.  I think he's doing...  I think so.  But is he pre-taping them?  No.  Either way, he'll be here.  I don't want Rana Fez to get annoyed like I'm leaving my shit to get signed in their studio.  I hope they don't take that.  We've done it for them.  They don't mind.  We don't mind.  Sex Man, can I leave this here?  Rick Springfield.  E-Rock.  Can I see a Rick Springfield picture?  It's actually a good one.  Can I see it?  You don't want to introduce me to him? 
[00:03:30]  Who?  I'll leave right here.  Bruce Hill...  Bruce from fucking...  Bruce...  Baron?  Fryer.  I'm blueberry bumming this picture.  Why?  Opie is chucking blueberries over the console.  I hope for one good splat.  Rick Springfield picture.  What'd you say?  I happen to value that photo quite a bit.  Why?  Rick Springfield.  How many photos do you have with you today?  I have a couple.  This was my Selena photo.  No, no, no.  Not Selena.  Selena Gomez. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Selena is...  The other one was easier to get.  I just stood there with my hand on a Selena Gomez picture.  Let me see how hot she looks.  Which was...  She looks good, actually.  I mean, that was my...  How old is she now?  Nine.  And I got two copies of my photo with me and Bobby Kelly and Clay Guida and Uriah, which we  got a while ago.  And I got one signed for me, and I was going to surprise Big Dummy, but I got one signed  for him as well.  Oh, that's so nice.  And...  Did you get one of just him and you by yourself today?  A photo?  Yeah.  Of course.  Well, you think...  Believe me, that fat boy is going right out as soon as I can. 
[00:04:30]  But I just got...  I got this one signed, just in case you never know, on the way out, Uriah might fucking get  hit by a bus.  So I'm like, let me at least get it signed while he's here.  Right.  Because what's valuable about that is, if he dies, he won't be able to give you an autograph.  That's the best of planning.  Right.  But I didn't ask...  I have a brochure.  I have a fucking thing.  I didn't ask anybody to sign that, the booklet.  Why?  Eh, because I asked him to sign a couple things.  I didn't want to ask him to do 50 things.  I'm like, people...  I didn't want to be an asshole about it.  Dennis Leary seemed a little disgusted by your celebrity whoring.  But I think Dennis...  Yeah, but Dennis...  I told Dennis, too, like, you're more famous than me. 
[00:05:00]  Like, Dennis is famous where those guys know him.  Like, the Stones know Dennis.  They don't fucking know me.  It's a different level of recognition.  Like, Dennis sees these guys, and they'll all go, hey, man, hey, I love your stuff.  So there's a coolness that he'll get with these guys that I'll never have.  But if you raised to a level of fame, would you stop this?  No, because I do, because I enjoy it.  And it sounds obsessive and weird and crazy.  Yeah.  But usually they're right here, and I ask him to sign something.  I don't sell this shit.  I'm not fucking greedy.  It's just stuff to display. 
[00:05:30]  I don't care how famous you are.  I'm surprised that how nonchalant Dennis Leary was about the Stones.  Some people are like that.  I don't totally buy into that.  Some people are like that.  I love Dennis, but I don't know.  I wonder how much of that he was playing up.  I don't know, because he could have got the picture, but he didn't.  And I'll tell you, some guys are like that.  Some guys, like the head of security here, I was talking to Bruce.  He literally gets...  He didn't get a photo with Jimmy Carter, because his job is to be security.  He's like, it's my job.  I don't do it ever.  He was an ex-cop.  He just does not get pictures. 
[00:06:00]  Some guys don't give a fuck.  Dennis Leary probably also has too much pride to do it.  Maybe, yeah.  I mean, maybe a healthy sense of self-worth might be a way of looking at it.  What's Dennis Leary's Twitter?  Dennis Leary, D-E-N-I-S-L.  I spelled it wrong?  Yeah.  What did I write?  L-E-N.  You called him Lennis.  Wait, there's two Ns?  Yes.  One N.  One N.  D-E-N.  One N.  Son of a bitch.  Son of a gun.  Thank you, Jim.  Language.  Where's Roland?  I get part of his salary today. 
[00:06:30]  You get part of Roland's salary?  Fuck yeah.  My Twitter...  I got proof, man.  What's my Twitter again?  I forgot for a second.  Opie Radio.  Oh, that's right.  Opie Radio.  Spelled with a Y.  Spelled with a Y.  Because let me show you what I did.  So that means all I have to do is tweet celebrities and I can get a couple extra bucks?  Where's Roland?  I want some of his money today.  I'm serious.  Roland!  Eric, where's Roland?  I'm calling you.  Dana White tweeted at...  I believe this was at 5.15 when I was coming in with Kenny. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Just landed in New York City.  Now, I know Dana White has a million five followers.  One million and five?  So it's really hard to get a hold of him.  So I know at five in the morning, no one is really doing Twitter.  It's dead.  It's dead time for Twitter.  So I wrote, hey, you coming by today?  I put the bug in his ear.  I booked Dana White today and I want some of Roland's salary.  Where's Roland?  You could discuss that for 20 minutes knowing you.  He's walking Dana out.  Yeah.  What's he walking Dana out for?  Dana White knows how to leave.  He's got...  But bring it up.  And I'm serious. 
[00:07:30]  That you want some of Roland's cash.  I'll negotiate 10 vegetable drinks.  You want 10 vegetable drinks from Roland?  Yeah.  I don't need the money, actually.  But 10 vegetable drinks would be nice for me booking Dana.  I love a good vegetable drink shit.  What's better than a fucking juicy vegetable drink shit?  Just don't add beets.  Why?  I love a good beet shit.  It makes you feel like you might have ass cancer.  That's fine.  Because it comes out like blood.  Opie, I don't know if we want to talk about it or not.  This will make your poo look red.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  So a big cock. 
[00:08:00]  I didn't know either of those two things.  Beets is used as a dye, right?  A colored dye in a lot of shit.  I have no idea.  It'll make your fucking poopies look red.  Are we going to mention the person who's been on hold for the last hour and 15 minutes?  Dude, my phone screen, look at this.  It went out hours ago.  I didn't even know.  Who's on hold?  Bobo.  I'm out of here.  You're leaving?  Bobo Chase is threatening text.  I think he's threatening me or something now?  What do you mean he's threatening me?  Eric, what do you mean he's threatening me?  Heather Height DM'd me and said, what the fuck did you do to him this time? 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  You probably didn't go to the game.  Bobo sent me.  The game hasn't happened yet.  Look.  Heather Height.  Let's see.  I can't figure out what he's talking about, meaning Bobo.  But Bobo told me he's going to give you what for when you're live again.  What did you do now?  That's Heather Height.  H-E-I-G-H-T-R.  Yes.  She's listing the wrong statistic.  I fixed the phone screen.  Heather Height likes to have fuck guys with dildos, I hear you, too.  She likes to fuck guys.  All right.  Well, I mean, more power to her, I guess. 
[00:09:00]  I believe that would be...  Is she married?  Yeah.  Or is that just a boyfriend?  No, I think she's married.  Oh, married.  Yeah.  She pops her husband in the shitter with a strap on.  Wow.  I fixed your phone screen.  It was off.  He's walking away.  I know.  I think it was Bobo who chased him out.  We're back here with After...  Bobo sent me this text on Tuesday.  What did the text say?  He was all pissed off.  He's like, I'm going to...  He's calling in on the first live show back that he wants to address and take care of Opie. 
[00:09:30]  He can't say things about me on his Twitter from Friday, which would be July 1st.  So I went back and looked at Opie's Twitter.  I can't find out what the fuck he's talking about, but he was all pissed off.  I have no idea what he's talking about, and I read Opie's Twitter.  Also, Bobo sent Facebook messages to me and Travis, like three, within a single hour.  First saying, hey, can I come on the show on Friday? 
[00:10:00]  And then saying...  And then 15 minutes later, when he hadn't been responded to, saying, why haven't you responded to me?  And then 10 minutes later...  So this is all within one hour, sending another message to both of us that says, where are you hiding from me?  Was this on Tuesday?  I don't know what day it was.  It was one of the days we were on vacation.  Because that was the day that we were getting the text.  What the hell is the matter with him?  Let me find out real quick.  Yeah, Daniel.  Yeah, I'm here. 
[00:10:30]  What's your deal, dude?  No, nothing.  I just misread the tweet.  I misread the tweet.  What did you...  What tweet were you referring to?  Oh, no, it was saying on July 1st.  I don't remember what it said, all right?  Because I'm not...  Smart.  Ouch.  Right.  Yeah, I misread the tweet, all right?  And so why are you sending messages to Travis and me, and then threatening us when we haven't responded within 15 minutes?  You know, it's something. 
[00:11:00]  I was wondering, how come you guys didn't respond?  Because we're not on Facebook 24 hours a day, Bobo.  And it's vacation.  All right.  It was...  You sent three messages within an hour, and you couldn't figure out why we hadn't responded.  It's because we weren't on Facebook.  Well, I'm already upset I freaking scared Opie, and I was going to offer the ticket.  Well, when is the game?  The game is on the 16th.  And the tickets have been upgraded, by the way.  Upgraded?  Yeah, I remember you offered Opie tickets to a Mets game in the nosebleeds up top. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, and these seats were upgraded greatly by a friend of mine.  How'd that go down?  Well, good, all right?  If Opie goes, I got these seats.  These seats are upgraded.  Yeah.  All right, how?  What?  I said, how did that go down?  What?  What, do you front...  What, asking Opie?  No, how did you get upgraded tickets?  A friend of mine.  All right, whatever, Bobo.  I mean, I don't know how many questions I have to ask. 
[00:12:00]  The Ron and Fez interns are here setting up the studio, and I find it more entertaining  to just watch them than to listen to you.  Yeah, but it's a friend of mine who gave me those upgraded tickets.  All right, well, when is the...  So you still have another...  What is that, a week?  Not this weekend, but next weekend?  Yeah.  All right, so what are you so worried about?  You still got another week to talk to him.  Hey, are we doing Couch of Zilch's tomorrow?  I don't know if Travis is around.  If Travis is in earshot, are we doing Couch of Zilch's tomorrow? 
[00:12:30]  Because two weeks ago, we weren't here last Friday, and two weeks ago, we started Couch  of Zilch's, where we just invited some random fans to come in.  Four of them, as a matter of fact.  And that went down via Facebook.  We said we were going to continue to do it, I think.  Eric, are you back?  Yeah, I was trying to see about Rick Springfield.  Oh, oh, okay.  Do you know if we're doing Couch of Zilch's tomorrow?  Honestly, I don't know. 
[00:13:00]  That's more of a Travis question.  I'll find out.  Where's Travis?  Mark Zito, where is everybody?  We were asking for Roland.  We were asking for Travis.  I don't know.  So far, we've got Bobo and your intern.  Are we doing Couch of Zilch's tomorrow?  I don't know.  You'll have to find Travis.  Oh, man.  Bobo, what's your plan?  Obviously, you were on hold for over an hour today, and Opie wouldn't pick up your call.  Yeah.  So what's your plan of action?  I don't know. 
[00:13:30]  The next time I see him or I call in, all right, I'm going to offer these tickets.  Where's Roland and Travis, Eric?  Do you know?  They're both not here.  I don't know where they are.  Where's everybody going?  Is there some kind of zombie thing happening that I wasn't informed of?  They're gone.  Why is everybody?  I'm still looking for them.  And you're running around doing God knows what.  I've got to take care of Rick Springfield.  Jim's picture?  Yeah.  Oh, it's important.  Yes.  It is.  I mean, Mark Zito, you have to understand.  If Jim Norton doesn't get the picture signed properly, he gets extremely upset. 
[00:14:00]  And then you have an upset host, which brings down the product.  You wouldn't want that.  No.  Bobo, do you understand that?  Yeah.  Then why do you keep upsetting Opie so much?  I don't mean to upset him, all right?  I didn't get the chance to say I misread that tweet.  And then you threatened him.  You threatened him via Nagel text.  Well, I didn't know I accidentally texted Blue Rock.  Who did you think you were texting? 
[00:14:30]  Opie?  No, with someone else.  The writer was someone else, I would say.  Well, who else?  Because our names don't show up to get next to each other in the contact.  Yeah.  Who did you think you were texting?  Oh, no.  It was a friend of mine.  All right, Bobo.  So you're going to text some random friend of yours with a threat to Opie.  You know what's going on here, Eric, right?  He's not telling the truth.  He's lying.  Bobo is lying.  I'm not telling the truth.  I didn't know.  I texted you.  Maybe the thing misreads put the phone number under a different name accidentally. 
[00:15:00]  Wait, but no.  But you're saying you sent me a threatening text about Opie for something that he allegedly  Hold on.  That he allegedly said.  But then you're saying, no, it was supposed to go to a friend.  So why would you send a friend of yours a threatening text about Opie?  No, it's something I was going to say when I called it.  I can't do this anymore.  You're lying.  Bobo is gone.  I'm sorry.  But he could hear the patented Bobo right before the hang-up.  And he's not doing a bunch of zilches.  He's not.  No.  Now, he would have to enter. 
[00:15:30]  I would like to find out if we're doing that tomorrow or not.  Because I remember two weeks ago when we did it, we put a Facebook message up on facebook.com  slash Opie and Anthony right before, on the Thursday, on like Thursday, like early afternoon-ish.  And it was just, hey, first four people to respond at this email address get to go.  So, hopefully we'll find out before the hour's up whether or not we're doing that.  If we don't find out for sure, because I don't know what goes on here, then just keep checking the Facebook page today. 
[00:16:00]  Because it is on a first-come, first-served basis.  And look, we'll treat this thing fairly.  If Bobo is one of the first four people to respond to the email...  We will delete it.  You will delete it?  Okay.  Yes, and then make room for somebody else to win it.  Is Daniel Kerlin's email in the spam filter?  If it's not, it will be.  Now, Eric, when we last left Opie and Anthony, and after Opie and Anthony Live, the show you're listening to now,  you were not in a good mood. 
[00:16:30]  It seems that with a nice little six-day vacation, some time to rest, some time to assess things,  it seems like you're in a better mood today.  Yeah, I'm doing pretty good.  What was the deal on last...  What was it?  Wednesday?  Thursday?  Thursday was our last show.  What was the deal?  Because you were really pissed.  Because you set up a Twitter account.  Someone did.  And about what time did I arrive? 
[00:17:00]  What's the Twitter account?  I don't know.  It's some piece of shit that you set up.  I don't know if I set up, but you...  I saw you working on it on the computer.  The computer is right in front of me.  I saw you working on it.  And then you're saying, I don't know where that photo came from.  But you've gotten over it now?  As I saw you go to another site, download it, resize it, and then upload it to Twitter.  I didn't do all that.  Yeah.  Roland.  Oh, there he is.  I'm glad you're here.  First of all, Eric is feeling better after the last Thursday.  You remember on Thursday, he was really pissed off because somebody set up the Sex Buzzer Twitter account? 
[00:17:30]  Oh, that's what it was.  Who did that?  I don't know, but he's feeling better about it now.  Right, Eric?  No, I'm not feeling better about that Twitter.  How many followers is it up to?  It's over 3,500.  Man.  Not bad, right?  Not pretty good.  What?  Not pretty good.  That's what you just said.  Opie, right before he left here today, mentioned that the booking, the Dana White booking, was...  He said primarily an Opie booking.  He said most of Dana White coming in here had to do with the fact that he tweeted him. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  What say you, Roland?  Opie did tweet him, but then I emailed his guy who was with him, and that's the guy who brought him in.  Well, Opie said...  That's what the guy said to...  That Dana saw the tweet.  So...  I didn't put sure Dana saw the tweet, but I also emailed the guy who was with him.  Well, Opie has said that because of that, he was partial guest booker today.  And with that comes his salary, and he would like some of your money. 
[00:18:30]  If he could get zero, zero, he's more than welcome to it.  More specifically, Opie said, you know, I don't really need the money.  He said he would like 10 vegetable juices from you.  That's...  10 vegetable juices, that's $85.  A juice costs $8.50?  Yeah.  Or, yeah, eight something with tax.  Why does it cost that much for juice? 
[00:19:00]  Because...  It's healthy.  Because Upper West Siders pay that.  Because they're like, oh, no problem, ta-da.  That's what rich people pay.  I mean, it looks like you don't have to do it all in the same day.  But still, that's $85.  Do you want management to do it, though?  Because they love...  They want to be loved by the guy so much, they should give up the money.  Well, Opie said that he would prefer if you did it, since he did your job.  It's what he said.  But I'll have the guy email, and he'll tell him that he saw my email before the Twitter.  Well, this is something that we're going to have to take care of with Opie in the room, then. 
[00:19:30]  Because I'm getting a lot of pushback from you that I didn't necessarily expect, Roland.  No, no.  He did tweet, and I emailed the guy, and the guy goes, oh, I saw it.  His guy goes, hey, we'll get him in.  How was your 4th of July?  It was good.  You know, it's unfortunate.  Today on the Opie and Anthony show, of course, we didn't get a chance to bring up much.  We talked about Anthony and his compound in terms of him hanging out with Daniel Craig. 
[00:20:00]  I mean, some videos are pretty awesome.  Really?  Yeah.  He's got videos.  Yeah.  That is pretty awesome.  What's going on in these videos?  He can't say.  That's why I saw the videos.  He said he can't discuss them.  Well, I'm assuming it's him and Daniel Craig.  Yeah.  What are they shooting?  They went to a firing range.  You can say that.  Okay.  So that means, yeah.  So you saw videos of him shooting guns with Daniel Craig.  Sure.  Yeah.  Okay.  Is there anything else to the videos, or is that it?  That's pretty much it. 
[00:20:30]  But they're cool.  They're awesome.  Okay.  Um, but he talked about hanging out with Daniel, which I mean, was just bizarre when those pictures  started popping up on Twitter.  Um, but what he didn't talk about was the big compound party that went down, uh, Tuesday  or whatever, 4th, 3rd of July party.  Yeah.  Eric drank a lot of beer.  Did Eric drink?  Because I saw Eric do a shot.  You drank a lot of beer.  I saw him do a shot.  I did not drink a lot, no. 
[00:21:00]  I saw Eric.  That was me.  At least, you did.  You didn't drink that much.  I kept refilling my cup over and over again.  That's why I, yeah.  But it was an early night for you.  Yeah.  Eric, did you drink a lot?  I saw you.  No, I had two shots with, uh, Anthony's sister and that was it.  Whoa.  Two shots with Anthony's sister.  What's up with that?  Because you usually don't drink around show people.  Uh, no.  Plus I was, I drove almost everybody there.  So I really couldn't drink.  Troy was like lit up. 
[00:21:30]  He wasn't.  I saw, he was supposed to be like the party guy.  He wasn't the party guy.  He jumped in the pool.  He kept saying, I'm going hard on this party.  Yeah.  I'm going to go so hard.  And what happened?  He wasn't.  But I do have to say though, Danny was the grill master.  Danny grilled up a hell of a chicken on a stick.  He grilled those wings that had tears in my eyes, how delicious they were.  Did you enjoy them?  They were awesome.  Burgers, delicious.  I was, I drank a lot.  I became a bit fucked up and he goes, teriyaki, me on the stick. 
[00:22:00]  Eric, is Spencer looking for you?  Spencer's outside looking through the windows.  Eric is tripping me out because he keeps running back and forth.  Oh, there's, Spencer must be looking for Eric.  No, no, we're fine.  What's he, what do you, are you working on this?  Is, why, is this more for the picture?  Uh, well, I think the picture's being taken care of.  It was given to Steve Leeds, so he's going to take care of it.  How come that, who would have thought that Rick Springfield would be that hard to get?  That's, I guess he's kind of a big deal.  I mean, Jesse's girl was big and he was good on that soap opera, but beyond that, I don't 
[00:22:30]  know much about it.  He was on Californication.  You knew he was in a soap opera?  Yeah, for the last two seasons.  Yeah, that was, that was what he was before, uh, before he was a star.  Was he, he was like General Hospital or something?  Yeah, before he was a, uh, musician.  He was on, a soap opera actor.  What are you doing, Roland?  Nothing.  Okay.  By the way, uh, uh, I saw you retweeting like four of Blake Shelton's tweets in a row.  Blake Shelton, yeah, his CD comes out Tuesday.  Oh my God.  Which is awesome.  Now listen, uh, there was something else I wanted to talk about. 
[00:23:00]  Oh yeah.  Blake Shelton's CD comes out Tuesday.  That's not what I wanted.  Or you could pre-order it now on iTunes.  Was it more about the party?  Or BlakeShelton.com.  Uh, no, because I don't want to talk too much about the party in case Anthony ends up getting  into it tomorrow.  Gotcha.  Um.  Anthony just tweeted.  What did he just tweet?  BlakeShelton.com for all information.  Enough of Blake Shelton.  I'm dumping out.  Don't worry.  Thank you.  Um, but although I would like to find out what happened to Eastside Dave because.  Yeah, what happened to him?  He let you guys leave.  Yeah.  And, uh, because you guys left at like 10.30.  Uh, no. 
[00:23:30]  Did we?  Yeah, it was like quarter to 11 maybe.  It was early when you guys left, but, uh, Dave said that this was his night.  He wasn't.  And he ended up staying over at the compound.  And then by the time I dropped everyone off and I got home, there was already a photo up on  Twitter of, of Dave relaxing comfortably next to Andy Levy in the hot tub.  Well, I'll tell you this.  What you guys missed as soon as you left was Dave nude in the pool.  Oh, no.  And that's a story that if, I mean, I don't want to reveal all on the after show. 
[00:24:00]  I'll allow it to Opie and Anthony tomorrow if they bring up Anthony's party.  Anthony also has a video of him trying to, of Dave trying to get water out of his ear  with a fork.  Oh, Jesus.  And also, like, I was going to stay.  I'll stay and go with Dave.  But like a casino, you leave Anthony's house.  You become tired.  You realize the time.  Yeah, you lose all track of time in the compound.  In that compound, it's like Vegas.  You go on all night for four days.  Does it make you, Roland, does it make you, we had Dennis Leary in here. 
[00:24:30]  Mm-hmm.  Does it make you worried about your job when Opie and Anthony start talking about how badly  they want to leave radio?  No.  How come?  Because we all move on.  So you're ready for them to move on.  If that's what they want to do.  Well, that's what they said.  So whatever they want to do, I respect and move on.  Now, Eric, I would ask you the same question, but I think I know the answer.  Are you worried about your job when that comes up?  No, I'm not.  Why is that?  I would prefer that they didn't. 
[00:25:00]  But if they decided to, then, you know, it is what it is.  Well, what did you say on Twitter earlier this week?  Somebody said, are they going to fire E-Rock?  Or are you trying to get E-Rock fired?  And you responded something like, not soon enough or something like that.  Oh, it's probably something about, is management going to fire E-Rock?  I wrote it not soon enough.  You're just a smartass when it comes to that stuff, Eric.  I dare you.  Oh, Eric.  Eric, you don't want to make those claims. 
[00:25:30]  I mean, are you...  I was clearing my throat.  What?  I double-talked you.  Are you that...  See, that's rolling.  That's rolling.  That's not me.  Are you that...  What the...  Unbelievable.  Ron, you missed it.  What did I miss?  The great Ron Bennington enters the arena.  Eric was just daring management to fire him.  That was Roland saying that.  That was not me.  Why did he...  What's the dare about? 
[00:26:00]  Well, he said...  We said he's a smartass when it comes time to talking about O&A leaving...  Do it today.  ...and moving on to different things in radio.  Again, that's Roland doing that.  Oh, because of the big rumors going around about the new Sabo station and them?  Well, because Dennis Leary came in today.  You don't scare me.  And they made no qualms about telling him how fed up they were with radio.  They wanted him to cast them in a TV show and all this stuff.  I love the shit.  But now there's all these rumors going around that they're going to be involved in the new New York station, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:26:30]  I mean, I don't know.  You're in it everywhere.  I don't know what's going on anymore.  But Roland said he's not worried because people move on.  And then Eric said he's not worried because he's ready to get fired anyway.  He doesn't give a shit is what he did.  I did not say that.  And he dared him.  That was you, Roland.  He double-dog dared him, too.  Well, Roland, you've been whispering into the mic.  You know, E-Rock, if you need to do anything at all, please join me as I search for the killer of young Kaylee Anthony.  It's about...  I was hoping that somebody would take up this cause.  Let me tell you something. 
[00:27:00]  And I know Florida like the back of my hand.  You've been there before.  I've been there.  Yeah.  Eric grew up there.  I got it fucking wired.  Eric grew up there, too.  No, I did not.  Of course he did.  And the thing is this.  Somewhere there's clues.  Somewhere out there there's a clue.  Well, listen.  Last time Ron and Fez were off for a few days, Bin Laden's dead.  Shh.  I'm just saying.  I know you don't talk about it, but that's what happened.  The events lined up. 
[00:27:30]  So it looks like O&A are done, right?  I mean, between all these other radio offers and all the TV stuff with Leary.  Based on what...  Everything that I'm hearing is true.  Based on what they say on the air, I would think so.  Although Leary didn't have any concrete offers for them.  He actually looked at them...  Leary's playing coy, as he's apt to do.  He looked at them and said, what the fuck else are you going to do, really?  And then asked Anthony what his age was.  I like the way he's playing that.  Seriously, I like the way he's playing it.  You're an old negotiator, so you know the way these things are played. 
[00:28:00]  Yes, I know how it goes down.  Yeah.  Also, let Leary know I got a couple questions for him about Kaylee.  That's all.  He's not a suspect.  He's a person of interest.  Wow.  Dennis Leary.  I see his attitude.  He's constantly yelling about this and that he's got a temper.  He's an asshole.  Well, if you're going to believe music, and who doesn't?  Who doesn't believe music?  So is that sort of...  Are we going more celebrity investigation? 
[00:28:30]  We don't know at this time.  I mean, obviously, the thing that pisses me off is Randy Savage died in that mysterious death in Florida.  Yeah, what state?  Florida, again.  Here's another thing, though.  Who's constantly in and out of Florida?  Florida, Mr. Jimmy Buffett.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Because you think about this in terms of just the regular people.  You don't think in terms of what celebrities are we questioning.  Well, the grandfather, the top mom's mom. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  The top mom's dad.  Top mom.  That molested her when she was eight.  I got my eyes on him.  Malcolm McDowell.  I am looking very, very hard.  No, they were one and the same.  You didn't notice that?  You know, looking back now, I feel like a fool because they look exactly alike.  Another thing.  Thank God you're back here, too, Sam.  I know you don't like to get, you know, self-congratulatory.  We were in a fucking bind.  Really?  There for a while. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  Spin the wheel.  Make the deal.  Leary's fucking crazy idea once again blew up in his face.  Yeah.  He came in and said, we got to do this, guys.  We go, Dennis Leary.  You know what?  It works on TV.  It doesn't work on Sat Rad.  Right.  Is that what they're calling this?  Sat Rad?  Yes.  That's why I say, oh, and I had to leave Sat Rad?  And is this the Sat Rad investigation of Kaylee Anthony?  Is this justice for Kaylee from the Ron and Fez show?  We will make sure that this case gets solved. 
[00:30:00]  I'm doing this for every Florida MILF that's down there now, screaming in the heat.  Well, technically, she's not MILF anymore.  No, I'm talking about for all the other MILFs.  Oh, oh, oh.  That are out there screaming, how can a mother do this?  Oh, you want to find out?  Today was my favorite sign they spent on HLN, the only fucking station that really cares  about top moms.  The only station that really rocks at this point.  Yes.  While the others are talking, they're rocking.  Someone had a sign that said, a village is missing 12 idiots. 
[00:30:30]  Now, old joke, yes, not the HLN.  They fucking focused on it.  They spent a half an hour interviewing this screaming, sweating woman.  See, you had Eastside Dave down at the Letterman protest with the ticket sign.  And he did a great job.  That is a protest that Dave should have been at.  You know what?  I'm going to put Dave on my list of people of interest.  Where has he been?  Blacked out?  Naked in at the East Pool. 
[00:31:00]  Who knows?  He put on some fucking act there, huh?  At Anthony?  Well, somebody had to.  I mean, you know, Troy was supposed to show up and he disappointed.  Right.  Roland was sort of just waiting for the party to take off.  And, you know, somebody had to bring the party.  Yeah.  Ant was there.  He's the host of the thing.  He can only do so much.  You know, Dave says something to me that was just so dead on.  He goes, I'm coming up so they better get the party started.  That's the song.  Yeah.  That's the song he came into the house with.  And they call him Pink Skin. 
[00:31:30]  And when he comes in, he rocks.  Now, did he make it home that night or did he?  No.  He stayed in.  As a matter of fact, see, Dave was actually disappointed because he drove with Troy, Roland,  and Sex Bagel.  Eric Nagel.  One time you serve.  Right.  Exactly.  And we all sat in the back together, back to back.  Right.  Like, they all crammed into the sex mobile.  And they showed up at Anthony's house together.  And Dave had said, look, I'm just doing whatever Troy's doing. 
[00:32:00]  I'm sticking with Troy tonight.  10.30 p.m.  Troy goes, I'm going to take off, dude.  And Dave goes, what?  And so he wasn't that drunk yet.  Right.  But he goes, I'm staying.  Like, I'm not leaving this party at 10.30.  And I don't know.  I left it, like, a little after 11.  And he was still.  He was in the hot tub with Andy Levy, Joe DeRosa, and Ant.  Just enjoying.  Yeah, just enjoying life.  Man tub.  Yeah, I mean.  Or was it Joe DeRosa?  Yeah, it was Joe DeRosa.  No, you missed earlier in the party. 
[00:32:30]  Roland kept telling everybody there's some guy at this party that looks like Joe DeRosa.  So people that didn't know Joe thought that really wasn't Joe DeRosa.  Roland, you're full of tricks.  You just, you never know.  By the way, Roland, as many tricks as he plays, might be a person you want to talk to.  Why is that, really?  I didn't even know he was somebody who knew the family.  He's a trickster, and he knows people in Florida.  That's awesome.  Or maybe it's Mars, because he knows people who touch people.  The only thing is, I know that Roland has a My Beautiful Life tattoo. 
[00:33:00]  And that ties in.  Bella Vita.  Yeah, they got it at the same time.  Which, to me, is too much of a coincidence.  But this is your investigation.  I don't want to intrude.  I gotta have facts.  That's the difference.  Yeah.  Okay.  Do you know who your co-host is today?  Is there anybody we can promote?  I believe it's Maurice the Exterminator.  I gotta tell you, who was the young lady you had in the other day?  Oh, Loretta something, I believe.  She, I was in the hallway next to the studio with DJ Who Kid and Ron Artest, and out comes 
[00:33:30]  Loretta, you know, in a pink frock, just kind of blushing.  I don't know if it was...  Well, I kind of feel bad about this, because I sent Loretta out there.  I go, what's the brouhaha?  Because I can see it through the glass here.  I go over and find out, you know, find out what's going on.  And Loretta said, dress like this.  I said, hurry!  Hurry!  Well, she found out. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  Those guys over there, they, man, you white guys are crazy.  Yeah, that is true.  White people are nuts.  They are.  Listen, speaking of crazy white people, Ron and Fez is coming up next, so stay tuned,  because Opie and Anthony, and after Opie and Anthony Live, continue tomorrow.  The investigation starts right after this.  Opie and Anthony's show is now over.  For real this time. </pre>
