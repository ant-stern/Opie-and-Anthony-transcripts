<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a segment heavily focused on Tom, their New Orleans affiliate.  Tomâ€™s extreme incompetence was on full display, highlighted by his repeated blunders: misprinted t-shirts, illegible commercial copy submitted as a scanned image, and general unprofessionalism fueled by apparent intoxication.  The hosts repeatedly responded to his mistakes with a sarcastic "My bad," while Tom offered increasingly absurd and vulgar commentary about his wife's online photos and his lifestyle. This segment also included a studio guest, Paul (an Emmy-winning writer), who helped rewrite Tom's disastrously written Premier Mitsubishi commercial. The segment concluded with calls from Pete (another New Orleans listener criticizing Tom) and a final call to Tom at a convenience store where he bought a 24-pack of Miller Lite, culminating in a comical interaction with a female customer who angrily hung up after Tom's offensive attempt at humor.

The show then transitioned to a chaotic mix of musical interludes and phone calls. Opie performed his self-composed song, "Mighty Malachi, the Bowling God," a lengthy, profane, and bowling-themed rant.  A caller, Tammy, shared humorous anecdotes about her physique and past career as a phone sex operator, prompting Opie to crudely analyze her body.  Tammy recounted a disturbing phone call that led her to quit her job.  This was followed by a caller role-playing a highly explicit incestuous scenario with Anthony, who played the sister.  The segment concluded with calls from "Old Dirty," detailing his explicit sexual exploits with Debra, punctuated by debates about the truthfulness of his claims, and a bizarre, off-key AC/DC performance by Jim Brewer, another studio guest, who was present along with Adam Ferrara and his mother. Brewer's family provided much of the show's later humorous and vulgar content, focusing on various embarrassing incidents and family dynamics, all punctuated by more profanity and sexually suggestive humor.

The broadcast continued with comedian Jeff Norris recounting his early stand-up experiences in Long Island rock clubs, including a disastrous gig marred by pyrotechnics injuries, his claims of song theft by major bands, and the chaotic nature of the Long Island music scene.  A bizarre phone call with Andrew Dice Clay followed, centered around the nonsensical question "Which way? Medium or well done?",  leading to a discussion of their creative processes and a dispute over comedic catchphrases. Dice Clay also shared humorous and sexually explicit anecdotes from his personal life.  The segment later involved a contentious call with Norris, focusing on his questionable story about a prop gun incident involving a *Law & Order* shoot and a police stop. The hosts, callers, and even George from the Otto and George puppet act debated and mocked the plausibility of Norris' account.

The final segment featured comedian Steven Lynch as a guest, along with Paul Mercurio and Mike Di Nicola. Opie began with unsubstantiated claims about William Shatner's belongings being used as Star Trek props, followed by a morbid and comedic song about necrophilia and his relationship with his deceased mother.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The show blows, blows, blows, blows, blows.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Blows, blows, blows.  The show blows, monkey ass.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Here, check it out, The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:00:30]  A couple phone numbers in New York, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including everywhere.  How about New Orleans?  The home of Annoying Tom.  How you got it doing?  866-2774, wow.  I guess Tom in New Orleans, you know this guy.  My bad.  My bad.  He ordered wow stickers and wow shirts to give out to our listeners down there in New Orleans.  Oh, this is classic.  Classic.  Ben, get on the mic real fast. 
[00:01:00]  A little syndication update here for you.  Tom is the guy who drove us nuts when we went down to Mardi Gras.  He's out of his effing mind.  What else can we say?  He takes pictures of his wife pretty much naked and puts them on the website.  I drink beer until I pass out.  One day, he forgot to turn the radio station on that we broadcast on.  Oops.  That's where, you know, my bad. 
[00:01:30]  My bad.  Yeah, his bad.  Well, we got the latest from Tom from New Orleans, Ben.  Yeah.  Tom ordered Extreme Radio t-shirts with the new logo down of the station down there.  He's like, yeah.  So I got the wow sticker on the back.  The only problem was they put 1027 WNEW on it.  I'm like, so Tom, you know, how many did you order?  He's like, well, I'd rather not talk about that.  Oh, no.  So he ordered a ton of shirts with Extreme Radio 94.1 on the front and 1027 hates them.  Like the bumper, the sticker itself, the image of the sticker is on the back. 
[00:02:00]  Exactly.  But it's the sticker from here, from New York.  You know, our wow logo that everyone seems to like.  But he didn't really look too close, I guess, and just handed it to the print shop,  and they just printed the wow sticker on the back.  So now the shirts are very confusing.  My bad.  It says 1027 WNEW on the back, and then it has the radio station in New Orleans on the front.  My bad.  My bad.  What a complete horse's ass.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  And we're depending on him for our success in New Orleans.  And then today he sends copy for a live read for you guys.  And I showed it to you.  He emails it, and he can't even read anything.  He, like, scanned or took a digital picture of the piece of paper.  Yeah, instead of just typing it up and emailing it.  Well, typing would take too much time.  So he's still drunk from Mardi Gras.  Yeah, I think he is.  Yeah, he never sobered up.  We've got to get Tom on the phone real fast here.  Tom from New Orleans.  What's up, bro?  How are you guys doing?  I'm doing great, Tom. 
[00:03:00]  My bad.  We heard about your latest F-up.  Well, I mean, as long as they didn't screw the stickers up, the shirts can be fixed.  The sticker thing got screwed up.  There was a problem with the order.  We had a little problem with the order.  Problem with the order.  Well, the stickers are fine.  The stickers will be fine.  My bad.  Let's just hope.  So what happened with the shirts there, Tom?  Well, it wasn't my fault.  Everything on my end was done correctly.  We had a promotion girl.  From your pattern of speech, I totally believe you. 
[00:03:30]  One foot out the door and one foot in.  And I mean, you know, I gave her the sticker.  I told her to just change the top to extreme, and somehow that didn't get done.  So let's just keep our fingers crossed that it got done for the sticker, huh?  Well, we got an idea.  We want to cross out the back of the shirt and then write at the bottom, my bad.  That's perfect.  So should we keep all those and it'll be a collector's item?  Yeah, yeah.  And just make an X through the sticker and write, my bad.  You know, Tom reminds me of, so the finished Stonehenge monument's going to follow these exact contours  when we get the actual piece. 
[00:04:00]  No, this is the piece.  This is the size.  Have you ever been to Stonehenge?  The triptych stand, three people against it.  Well, that's what you drew on the napkin.  F the napkin.  I wanted a full-size goddamn reproduction of a Stonehenge monument.  My bad.  Over here.  Did you get that copy?  I do declare.  How was that?  Is that some great copies?  The copy, we can't read it because it looked like it was just scanned. 
[00:04:30]  But I faxed one to Ben.  He ought to have it on his freaking fax machine.  But you know, when you're writing crayon, it doesn't fax well.  Yeah, I know.  Why don't you go down to the General Stoa and have Sarah top it up?  So you call the president a murderer?  New Orleans boob.  Norton, you are an imbecile.  You really are, Norton.  I thought we bonded when you were down here.  Hey, I like you on this.  I'll lift your head, man. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, that was awful.  I thought we bonded.  Hey, Tom.  And now you turn on me like that?  I like it.  What's the copy about?  Premier Mitsubishi, man.  It's about these guys Bishop and Owensby.  Don't finance anybody in two minutes.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Well, why don't you send us some copy we can read?  Copy.  Copy.  What the hell is that?  You guys get to work.  What is that in the background?  That's a sales desk.  You should untie them. 
[00:05:30]  Tom, we're off the air this day.  No, we're not.  There's a problem with the boas.  I'm going to go down and get me a sarsaparilla and whittle me a spell.  I could, whoo, his show is hot.  I could use a mint julep.  It's called a hurricane, boy.  It's on my heart.  It's called a hurricane.  I feel like a crawfish in the anus of a bull on a Wednesday afternoon in the hot July sun in New Orleans.  Hey, man.  That's how we say it back. 
[00:06:00]  Come down here and see if you can survive a week of partying down here, buddy.  Tom, they're going to tap dance on your head and say cock-a-doodle-doo.  And good day to you, sir.  No, no.  Isn't some great school, all-girl great school getting let out right now?  Can't you go do something?  3.15.  I get it.  Hey, Tom, you got people coming into your office and just saying my bad to your face over and over again now?  All day long, dude.  My bad.  My bad.  All day long.  Either my bad or how you guys doing?  How you guys doing?  There it is. 
[00:06:30]  How you guys doing?  What's a couple of cold ones?  We got them all, Rob.  I know.  My bad.  My bad.  All right, Tom.  I know.  All right, guys.  And hey, man, to that imbecile that wrote that letter out in California, you'd think they'd get it out there, man.  Tell them to turn the radio off.  I got a four-year-old and a two-year-old, but they're both boys.  Yeah, they're frying seven-year-old girls and leaving them on the side of the road.  Just the four-year-old, not the two-year-old yet, man.  And you got a hot wife with big boobs that you like to show off on the Internet.  That's right, baby.  It's hot, dude.  You like that? 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, really hot.  Very sexy.  All right, dude.  Call Bishop and Owensby, Premier Mitsubishi.  Right.  All right.  And if you guys can do my copy, I'd love you.  If you can't do it, well, I guess it's your best.  We'll get to it.  We love you.  All right.  You're hot down here, man.  All right.  Extreme 94.9.  Let's just keep the radio on, okay?  The radio is on, man.  No more problems.  No more problems.  You don't like problems.  Look at your call letters and remember them.  Yeah.  I do.  We have learned when the station is on, people listen to it.  Speak to them.  Fundamentally, people are suckers for the right call letters. 
[00:07:30]  And the truth is on your sidebar.  You know that switch that says on-off, tape it in the on position?  Right.  Hey, remember, this is Louisiana, Chief.  I mean, how do you know who your daddy is?  Because your mama told you so.  Ah, yes.  Michael Rooker.  I cannot work with Bill Broussard anymore.  Are you putting an ultimatum to me, Tom?  Yes.  All right, Tom.  All right, fellas.  All right.  Y'all behave.  You got great numbers coming out here.  Y'all behave, too, there, Tom. 
[00:08:00]  All right.  I'm going to go grab a couple of colds.  I'm going to declare them.  Your mama told you.  Your mama told you.  All right.  Pete wants to defend New Orleans now.  Pete, what's up?  How y'all doing?  Hey.  What up, bro?  I think Tom is the biggest idiot in New Orleans.  And you know how many times the station has screwed up since the last time?  How?  There was one day last week where we couldn't hear y'all at all.  What was on the air instead of us? 
[00:08:30]  They put music on for like 45 minutes.  Fucking guy.  Man, y'all are awesome.  But you know what?  He doesn't even advertise y'all.  It's like people like us that work out in the construction telling everybody else,  hey, why don't y'all listen to these guys in the afternoons?  Y'all are like the best thing in the afternoon.  Usually we get so pissed off, but he's such a character, you just got to laugh.  You expect it.  Dude, he's the biggest fag.  And that's not his wife.  That's a prostitute.  He pays that off to his sidekick.  No, that is his wife.  That ain't his wife.  You know what he needs?  He needs Ed Asner to pistol up him. 
[00:09:00]  Dude, y'all rules written.  You're awesome.  You need to come down here and tell everybody about it.  Extreme radio and smithereens.  All right, Pete.  I love y'all.  Take care.  Yeah, I love y'all.  There was a problem with the board.  I got music in.  It was supposed to be y'all's show.  But I hit the wrong button on what they called the board.  All right, we got Tom from New Orleans back on the phone.  And you know what, Tommy?  We had to call Tom back because we finally got the commercial copy. 
[00:09:30]  My bad.  My bad.  Do I have a copy of that?  Tom, I got beer on my seer sucker suit.  Can you tell me how to get that stain of beer out of my seer sucker suit?  We need that immediately.  You know what?  There's some problems with the copy.  Tom.  What?  There's problems with the copy.  Listen up.  I figured it was.  I figured.  I figured.  Well, we're going to read it on the air so they're going to get a free commercial. 
[00:10:00]  Okay.  Well, there's problems with it.  Okay.  Yeah, but now we need the copy, though, because I want to read it as it is.  But we can fix it.  We have an Emmy award-winning writer in the studio.  Yes.  Yeah, Paul will help.  Paul's going to write your copy today.  My Emma.  All right.  Emma.  I got an Emma.  My Emma award.  All right.  Sweetie have it.  All right.  I'm one in you.  That is a fun award.  I'm one, and Anthony's two.  It'll be very obvious what the problem is here. 
[00:10:30]  Let's see how quick everybody can figure out what the problem is with the copy.  Okay?  I say it's with an interest in line.  Well, you're in charge, don't you?  I love the lack of any responsibility Tom has for anything that goes on there.  Well, he had one of two choices.  If he spent time proofreading, the board would go dead again, and the entire station would get...  I'm monitoring the boas.  All right, Tom.  Here's our read.  Here we go. 
[00:11:00]  Let's read this.  Hey, Anthony.  Where'd you get the new car?  I got it at Premier Mitsubishi, Opie.  Tom?  Have you figured out the problem yet?  When will Anthony's car be arriving in New York City?  When am I getting my Mitsubishi?  My Premier Mitsubishi?  I'm going to call the guy tomorrow.  Make sure it's coming.  And then, Opie, read the next line, because now I'm getting bashed.  Let's start from the beginning.  This is not a knock against Mitsubishi. 
[00:11:30]  If they want to give Anthony a free car, I'm sure he'll drive it.  Well, I think off the bat, Anthony's not committing to that first line.  What's your motivation?  Okay, Opie, now read the line.  Go all the way down to the bottom of that first one.  Well, no, I want to start over.  Okay.  Because I think I can do it better.  Okay.  Hey, Anthony, where'd you get the new car?  I got it at Premier Mitsubishi, Opie.  Yeah, I've seen your credit.  Who co-signed for you?  Okay, Tom.  Tom, I see the problem there.  What am I now? 
[00:12:00]  I'm an old poor boy.  Can't follow the new car.  I have bad credit.  All of a sudden, I got, like, lousy credit.  I'm a scofflaw.  Well, Opie, I've been running from the law for robbery.  I'm syndicated in 33 markets, and I can't get a credit card.  I need a co-signer.  And by the way, it says, hey, where you get the new car.  Who wrote this?  What southern idiot wrote, where you get the new car?  Hey, Anthony, where you get the new car? 
[00:12:30]  You know, I was hoping his writing, but it makes it even better.  Where you get new car?  All right, we'll start again.  Let's see if there's any other problem.  Okay.  Hey, Anthony, where you get the new car?  I got it at Premia Mitsubishi Open.  Yeah, I've seen your credit, man.  Who co-signed for you?  Man, I went and saw the Bishop and Owensby.  They get everybody approved, and most don't need a co-signer, man.  Well, what if you don't have any credit or you have bad credit, man? 
[00:13:00]  Bishop and Owensby at Premia Mitsubishi can handle any credit.  Good old bad.  It's like a Japanese guy from the 60s wrote this.  And have you handled in less than 10 minutes.  Premia Mitsubishi.  Mitsubishi.  Yeah, it's like that little hip familiar.  Get the lingo, man.  Premia Mitsubishi can handle.  This stinks.  You really should be sterilized for this. 
[00:13:30]  I already am.  You know what it is, Tom?  What?  We have never been good with the pre-written Opie Anthony back-and-forth banter scripts.  Gotcha.  Never, ever good.  Always comes off sounding bad.  I like the note, Ben.  Tell ONA they can definitely go off the coffee.  Boy, I did.  That was me.  Yeah, I know.  It's important that you gave them that permission.  They just want to get the point across.  That anyone can get financed in two minutes. 
[00:14:00]  In two minutes.  Hey, I'll go off the coffee.  Okay.  Hey, Anthony, screw your great new car.  I need some Coke.  Where's Tom?  He's making sure of the station's still on the air.  I know you can drink in the airport.  He's drinking in the airport.  Tom, maybe you should feed your radio station some Coke and it'll stay on all night long.  I might have to come.  It might come to that one day, you know.  You could drive away in a brand new Mitsubishi in one hand, the steering wheel, and the other, a brimming ice-cold hurricane. 
[00:14:30]  A hand grenade.  A hand grenade.  As you leave the showroom floor in your new Mitsubishi, you could be doing 90 miles an hour with a drink in each hand.  Drive with your knees as you go through the Crawfish drive-thru.  Crawfish Monica.  Oh, God.  Well, Tom, how about a rewrite?  And we'll see what you got for us.  All right.  I'll take care of this personally. 
[00:15:00]  Rewrite it so that there are no words on the page.  Okay.  All you just kind of want to know is the name of the place, the car they sell, and the phone number.  Are you more drunk from the last time we talked to you?  Like, 20 minutes later, you sound more hammered.  How about, hey, Anthony, my neck hurts.  I have cancer.  I've had it for years.  Really?  I just want to be a priest, live in a monastery, serve God, and they defrock me.  You know, every line.  I know.  How many times did you say that? 
[00:15:30]  That's scary.  That's 40.  40 times, I bet.  It's so good.  Very good.  It's such a great movie.  You saw that movie that time?  It's a guy's film.  You'll find me one chick that can sit through that.  They're like, no action.  Dummies.  Not one girl I've ever effed can get through JFK without saying something stupid or broad-like.  Hold on.  We're throwing a girl in a dumpster soon.  Calm down.  I'll re-read it for you, though.  All right, Tom.  All right, Tom.  I'm making a stop.  I'm making my nightly stop on the way home.  Thank you.  Much obliged to you, Tom. 
[00:16:00]  Much obliged.  Getting a cold one.  You know what I mean?  He's really stopping for beer right now.  Right now.  He's the guy that he's spending on.  Enjoy the keg.  You want to talk to the cashier?  Yeah, let's talk to the cashier.  Okay.  Tom, you know the rules.  Tell them they're on the air.  Okay, I will.  I know the rules.  He's a side name sample.  He's just friends.  Hey, how y'all doing?  How you doing?  How you guys doing?  Go ahead.  Talk, go ahead.  I don't need to get her this one beer.  She's going, you're the idiot that wrote that copy for Premier Mitsubishi? 
[00:16:30]  Get out of my store.  Put her on the air radio.  Let's see that.  How you doing?  Tom.  Hey.  Tom, put her on the phone.  All right.  Here.  Let's see.  Opie and Anthony, we do a radio show down here.  Wait.  I just want to ask you something.  I'm actually there from New York.  Can I get my bag?  I'm sorry.  You know.  She's going to slap you upside your head.  Wait.  What's the problem there, Tom?  Hello.  Hi.  How are you doing?  How are you doing?  I'm fine.  What's your name?  Jamil.  Jamil.  What did Tom over there just buy? 
[00:17:00]  Right now?  Yeah.  It's 545.  No, no, no.  No one said what time it is, stupid.  What did Tom just buy?  Listen.  Listen.  Huh.  What did he just buy?  A beer.  How much beer?  Hello?  24.  Miller Lite.  Miller Lite?  30-4 ounce?  24 ounce.  Oh, 24 pack?  Yeah.  No, 24 ounce.  Miller Lite.  Did you float over on a raft? 
[00:17:30]  What are you talking about?  I want to see your green card.  All right.  Like, everybody in line is getting really pissed off at me.  I bet.  Well, they've got to get their funyuns and beer.  They've got to get home.  Wheel of Fortune is about to come on.  They have a life.  What are they worried about?  Hey, Tom, put a gal on the phone.  Let's say hi to a gal.  You want to, too?  Yeah.  Tell her on the air, though.  How about a southern bell?  Let me get back up. 
[00:18:00]  We're going to get a southern bell.  A nice southern bell on the air.  Oh.  I do declare your poop chute is the most pretty.  We're kind of in a bad neighborhood.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  I do declare Tom is some kind of a man.  Man, you're going to get a city.  You're not getting a southern bell here, boys.  Believe me.  She might be getting Queen Latifah's angry young sister, but she's coming out. 
[00:18:30]  As soon as she's done military pressing, have her come to the phone.  Wait, he's waiting for the lady to leave.  Get on with some baggy jeans.  Yeah.  He's waiting outside.  And hold on.  I'm waiting out, Todd.  All right.  All right.  Hey, how you doing, man?  How you doing?  This is Opie and Anthony from New York to do a radio show.  I just wanted to talk to you on the air.  They're syndicated in, like, 50 markets.  Oh, okay.  Big numbers.  Hold on.  Okay.  Opie and Anthony.  Hello.  How you doing, baby?  Okay.  How you doing?  What's your name?  My name is Kathy.  Kathy?  Yes, sir?  Kathy, Tom was supposed to pick the ugliest woman in that parking lot. 
[00:19:00]  Are you the ugliest woman in that parking lot?  Oh, that's what you've probably been doing?  Yes.  Oh, Tom.  Oh, why would you do that to me?  You didn't try to pick the ugliest woman in that parking lot.  No, they didn't.  Oh, why would you do that?  Oh, man.  No, I'm not going to do this.  No, I'm not going to do this.  He's gone.  She threw the phone down.  Effing brilliant.  That's great. 
[00:19:30]  Norton, give that Emmy to Norton right now.  Yeah, there you go.  That's great.  Holy Jesus Christ.  We're all, Barney, this goddamn thing.  We're all trying to flip it.  You nailed it.  You nailed it.  Holy.  Norton.  That was too goddamn funny.  I need to hear that again.  Immediately.  Immediately.  We're running out of time on the show.  Oh, you don't do that.  Oh, Tom.  Tom.  They told me you were supposed to be the ugliest woman.  Oh, my God. 
[00:20:00]  Tom.  Tom.  Hey.  Hey, what happened, man?  I think you might be doing the fun at me.  Goddamn, that was funny.  What did she do to you at?  She said, you told her the ugliest woman in the parking lot, Tom.  And then she said something else to you.  And then the other girl that was in line, the other lady, I should say, that was bitching  about me hitting her funions. 
[00:20:30]  She hollered at.  She was hollering at her.  Come on.  Leave him alone.  And then she threw the phone at me and left.  Tom.  Hung me out to dry there.  You know, you hung me out to dry there.  I need a drink.  God, he never disappoints.  We're going to have to wait through the phone at me.  All right.  Let's take a break.  We'll be back.  I love Snatch.  Anthony.  Bring on the horse.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You filthy creepiest. 
[00:21:00]  Where's the anthrax?  That's going to make a sweeper.  Where's the kaboom?  N-E-W.  Opie and Anthony.  1027 W-N-E-W.  I'll break my lips and close my eyes.  Take me away to hear the night.  I'm so damn bored.  I'm doing it.  I'm so damn bored.  Here I go. 
[00:21:30]  The motivation.  Where is my motivation?  Now I'm here.  The motivation.  Fulting my distance.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Toll free 877-692-1027.  Our buddy, our pal, has entered the studio.  Brewer.  Brewer. 
[00:22:00]  I like the dirty little birdies we've got going out of here.  Lot of ass.  Lot of ass.  I'll tell you what.  I've had swamp ass for the last four hours.  Have you?  Why?  Why?

You don't have to build up a fragrance back there, you know?  This is where the weather will make you violent.  No, it's going to shut up.  No, it's going to happen when you take your underwear off later.

His mom is right outside, and there's things going on out there that, you know, I don't know.  I know my own mother turns this show on.  That's not maternal instincts going on out there.  I know.  You see those boobs?  Those are real.  That's in your Paula Poundstone family of mothering.  Rosie O'Donnell mother.  It's unbelievable. 
[00:23:30]  Maybe we got Rosie down here.  Huh?  Oh, yeah.  That's what we want to see.  Rosie O'Donnell, try to get Rosie down here.  We want to see a flatso.  Please.  Yuck.  So we're going to have those pictures up on www.com.  What were you thinking?  Is your mom cool with stuff like this?  Oh, my mom's crazy.  Yeah?  She's out of her mind.  Because I'm looking, you know.  And my sister, my sister's...  That's your sister right there, right?  Right on.  There you go.  See, that was an accident.  She's like in her 50s.  I was a little...  Oh, you weren't supposed to be born?  Yeah, that was a lot of...  You mean it was supposed to be oops, Brewer.  My mom was like 40, 41. 
[00:24:00]  Hey, Brewer, keep your sister away from Adam.  It doesn't seem to stop him.  Oh.  Oh.  When did this happen?  What?  He'll date your sister at the drop of a hat.  What happened?  What happened?  You know, you should have a vein running up your face.  You're that big a dick.  It was many years ago, Brewer.  We were hanging out like we grew up together.  And his sister liked me and we went out.  Oh, that's what it was.  Yeah. 
[00:24:30]  Well, what was it?  Oh, I told you.  No, okay.  Anthony promised me his sister so I wouldn't invade his land.  What do you think it was?  Some kind of arranged thing.  I don't know.  You didn't have to accept.  Could have just said.  I asked permission.  I went to the Joe Buck Anthony Council.  Look, my intentions are pure.  I mean you with no disrespect.  Were you like the king of the block?  No.  It was just, you know, it was a group we hung out with and stuff.  And then, you know, you could say things like, hey, look, I'm really good friends with your brothers and stuff. 
[00:25:00]  And I don't think it would be appropriate.  But Adam didn't have that in his vocabulary.  I asked you first and I got a dowry of two sheep.  You dropped suddenly like, hey, your sister's growing up.  Your sister's hot.  Don't even think about it.  Yeah, that's what happened.  You know?  She liked me.  All right.  Well, ooh.  See, I thought you were talking about 50-year-olds.  And he came with his brothers.  What am I going to do there?  Yeah, you can't even get them with a payback. 
[00:25:30]  I'm sorry.  I got a couple of cousins you can look at.  Louise is hot.  Oh, God bless you.  You go out with my mother.  First thing you do is going to get a thank you note from my father.  I swear to God, I asked him the other day.  I said, Pop, how's married life?  He goes, ah, it's killing me.  But I'm not giving up.  She ain't going to win.  I'm telling you right now.  My dad always said, I said, Dad, that's marriage life.  He goes, put it this way.  My day exists with a pork chop and a good crap.  That's a good thing. 
[00:26:00]  My father's a diabetic.  I go, how you doing?  How am I doing?  Every morning I f*** on a stick.  How do you think my life is?  Ooh, I hope it's purple.  It's, you know, it's the little things in life.  I got a crap.  The little things in life that make you happy at that age.  My father doesn't even answer the phone anymore.  I go, Pop, don't you hit a phone ringing?  It's never good news.  Leave it alone.  It'll stop.  I got to love Big Joe.  Hey, Brewer, does your mom smoke pot or what?  No, she never did. 
[00:26:30]  No?  Did your mom?  No.  Did you ever smoke pot or no?  Give a thumbs up or thumbs down.  No?  You're a dirty liar.  I'm going to say this.  Look at her right now.  You see my mom?  Well, we can put her on the air for a sec, no?  Yeah, sure, Mom.  Come here for a second.  We'll be nice.  It doesn't matter.  She'll come right back at you.  Oh, it's all right.  Brewer's mom.  Ma, give me her.  Brewer's mom.  Brewer's mom.  How are you?  Do you remember when you got hammered when you were in the city?  She came.  Now, look at my mom.  I started my daughter.  No, no.  You got wrecked.  First of all, it's five in the morning. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  No, two in the morning.  Two.  What are you talking about?  Ma, it was five in the morning.  Two.  This is what I hear, like, you know, when, like, you were trying to sneak in as a kid?  Right, yeah.  Just praying.  This is what I hear.  And this is, okay, I hear the door open.  I hear this.  I did not.  Jesus Christ.  I'm on this floor.  I'm on this floor.  I can't get my pants off.  I can't get my pants off. 
[00:27:30]  I can't touch it.  She fell out of a cab into a puddle?  You think I'm lying?  Did you not do that in the village?  No, we fell off the curb into this place.  Oh, much better.  What's your poison, Mrs. Brewer?  Oh, what do you like?  Martinis.  Martinis.  What do you like, the absolute or?  No.  No?  Dry.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  I would like straight up, extra dry, just a little vermouth, not too much, and some chinky food. 
[00:28:00]  Uh-oh.  Who is she calling into the studio?  My daughter that was with me when we fell in the gutter.  Did you both fall in the gutter?  Yes, we did.  Your sister fell in the gutter, too?  Yes, your sister fell in the gutter.  My sister gets just as hammered.  Really?  She hasn't done it in a long time.  And her husband had to pick us out and put us in the cab.  Oh, my God.  She's like Arthur.  She's 78.  75.  Sorry.  74.  74. 
[00:28:30]  You're 74?  Yeah.  You're quite a firecracker at 74.  I've got to tell you that.  Wow.  Show us the moves.  Jim, stop it now.  Well, I met your mom.  We should put your mom.  Oh, I know.  I met you all the party right there.  My mom.  Tear ass up.  My mom.  I take her to see Jim Brewer at the Vanderbilt a couple of months back.  She is so hammered.  She's just, hey, Jim, I love you. 
[00:29:00]  I love you.  You are the greatest thing.  And she's hanging on him like, mom, either take him in the back room or stop right now.  I would do you.  But you know what?  I don't know if I want to do you.  I would do you.  I would do you.  I would do you.  I would do you.  I would do you want to.  Oh, that's great.  You'll offer Brewer your mother, but I can't date your sister.  Hey, you did.  Yeah.  Oh, my mother just out of control.  But these two together would probably be quite the item.  Falling out of cabs all over the city. 
[00:29:30]  Now, just one plan.  Just one?  Yes.  And we managed to get home.  Yeah, that's all that counts.  I fell out of the cab.  She couldn't get her pants off.  She couldn't get her pants off.  I had to come in there and take my mother's pants off.  Oh, my God.  Well, I took your pants off for 34 years.  Jim, she didn't come home after being out.  34 years.  Jim.  Jim, after being out with friends, she didn't come home with dick written on her forehead like  you.  No, unfortunately.  What's on your face?  Just get dick all over your face. 
[00:30:00]  She used to show up.  She knew I'm getting wrecked or like around the corner.  Yeah.  You know, your friend would come peeking up.  We'll take a drive around the corner.  Yeah, you got it.  This effort would show up when you are peeking.  You know when you're like, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.  Life sucks.  Get out of the goddamn car now.  Get out.  And who are these whores you with you with?  You remember that?  Yes, I remember.  She hunted me down a pizza place. 
[00:30:30]  These chicks are whores.  Get them out of here.  All of them right now.  Don't look at me like that, Missy.  You're a whore.  Oh, my God.  She's a whore, Norman.  My best friend was Joe, and she's like, and Joe, I'm very disappointed in you.  Humping that girl against the wall at James' Pizza.  You think I'm lying?  No, I did do that.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  This is like a therapy session for Joe.  Isn't it?  What a coincidence. 
[00:31:00]  He said, you're embarrassing me.  I said, you haven't seen anything yet.  This is out in the street.  You know, Queens.  Yeah, very embarrassing.  The brothers are watching just having a field day.  Oh, y'all, that nigga be wrecking out by his mother.  Mom's be wrecking.  That nigga be taken down by his mom, Joe.  Mom be taking that nigga down.  Look, she's falling in the gutter.  She's falling.  Oh, snap. 
[00:31:30]  He called that bitch a whore.  Were they whores, Jim?  Yeah, they were.  Mom, how did you know they were whores?  You can tell.  You can just tell.  Yeah, they had that look.  They had the look?  Yeah.  Right, they had that look.  Regutation?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  And you were disappointed in his friends?  See, my mother was never disappointed in Anthony.  I expect it from him.  I know.  I was like, I was a great thing for Adam to have around  because it made him look so good in the eyes of his parents.  That'd be around him.  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
[00:32:00]  And the other one with the tattoos.  Why can't you be like Adam?  Be like Adam.  Adam, I know you're good friends with Joseph,  but please don't take his example with the tattoos.  Right.  Okay?  They look good.  It's fine for him.  For now.  But not you.  You're not tough.  That's fine.  Or the earring in your ear.  Oh, did he get the earring?  Did you have an earring, bro?  What's wrong with the earring?  I didn't care.  Oh, you didn't care?  If my son wants to be a faggot, that's his business.  That's what my dad did.  Yeah, my dad was not happy when I got... 
[00:32:30]  But he doesn't yell.  He just gives you that look like...  Faggot.  Jesus Christ.  Why didn't you go stick a donkey down your throat?  Just end the day.  Put on a skirt and put the donkey in the n*** on your chin,  and let's go round and round.  I'm packing in.  I fought in World War II for this stuff for an earring.  Did you get a tattoo?  Do you have a tattoo, bro?  No.  Oh, I was too scared for that.  I told my father. 
[00:33:00]  I said, you know, I think I want to get a tattoo.  My father said, you better tattoo a new address on your arm,  because you ain't living here.  They all got that smart-ass remark, you know?  Yeah, we'd like that.  Hey, we were going to ask your mom if she, you know,  did you used to smoke the wacky tobacco?  Never.  Never did that.  No, I'm very virtuous.  Yeah.  And you raised a Jim Brewer.  And I raised five bad children.  You were the leader. 
[00:33:30]  You're probably very proud, though, right?  Yeah, I am.  Hey, did you really have a dog named Duffy?  Yes, we did.  Little Duffy.  Little Duffy.  He used to hang out underneath the table.  Mookie?  Mookie.  I'm not going to tell you what I call him.  Mookie.  Mookie Wilson?  Mookie.  Right on.  I'm not going to tell you.  Gee, let me think.  Was he black?  Yes.  Okay.  That's all he needed to know.  No, he was a right fielder.  Duffy. 
[00:34:00]  And you had to clean the crap off of the back of Duffy in the later years?  I didn't do that.  No, Jim had to do that.  Before you go out, wipe the crap off Duffy's tail.  And no goddamn drinking tonight.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.  You would have to say that.  Preface it before you went out.  No, I'm not drinking.  Was he a big drinker there, Mom?  Jim?  I think so.  Yeah?  Out with his friends and stuff.  I never came home drunk.  Oh. 
[00:34:30]  Well, you know what was cool?  It was like she would be passed out because you would have two, three martinis at 10 p.m.  I could be humping someone right on the couch.  My mother would be right next to me.  My dad's six-pack in.  My dog wiping his ass.  I'm.  Oh, my God.  She wouldn't wake up for hours.  But what would happen is in the morning, my dad was a sanitation worker. 
[00:35:00]  So he would get up about 4.35, dad, and he'd always get up.  And this is where I'd get, hey, jackass, get up, get up.  You know, I just fell asleep a half hour ago.  Still says nice head dick all over my face.  And he goes, hey, last night we all effed up.  I go, no.  He goes, your ass.  The car's in the bushes.  Before your mother wakes up, you jackass.  That was the dead giveaway, man.  Because there have been days you come outside and you go, I did not park my car like that. 
[00:35:30]  You know, and you kind of remember trying to parallel park or something or pull it in the driveway.  And you were really paying attention.  I've got to get a little closer to the curb.  I'm good like this.  Why?  You come out.  You're in the middle of the road.  Your car's backed into the curb.  Like two feet away from the curb on an angle.  It's like, wait, you couldn't even straighten it out.  There's days you come out and that's not my car.  Not only is it parked all left up, that isn't even my car. 
[00:36:00]  In the middle of the night you hear, ah!  What the hell?  What's a dick?  Nice park job, dick!  You come out.  I didn't push.  Someone moved it, man.  You got it easy.  My father used to go to bed when I had to be home at 11 o'clock.  I said, Pop, I'll be home.  He goes, you're going to be home at 11 o'clock.  I am setting my alarm.  I'm going to bed.  I'm setting my alarm for 10.59.  You better turn it off before I do.  Oh.  That's a good idea.  Oh, look at that. 
[00:36:30]  A little late.  That is a good one.  Yeah.  Well, we used to, ah, well, the first time drinking it, she was up.  You know, like, those nights you just go out and it just happens?  Yeah.  It's just like, oh, my God, it's 4.30.  What happened, man?  Where's my pants and my money?  Who's the dirty Mexican chick?  She's a whore.  So, yeah, I came over the first night where I really went drinking. 
[00:37:00]  I came home, and it was like 3 in the morning, and she was waiting at the door.  You know, this is a friend's field day.  His mom's off.  What a faggot.  What a faggot.  What a faggot.  And the whole time she's yelling, this is good, this is what I'm raising the beans.  My dad was cool.  He's like, please, I don't know where he's at.  Wait till the morning for Christ.  He's all left up.  Give me one of your White Castle's ass.  It's kind of traumatic for a mom the first time you come home all left up. 
[00:37:30]  Well, he was the youngest, and I went through that before with quite a few of them.  She looks at her daughter in the corner.  My sister drove my sister, which my mom didn't find out until, like, a year.  Or did you find this out yet?  My sister.  Oh, no.  Wrecks the garage door?  Yes.  She tried to sneak out with the car.  This is a nice head move, Doreen.  She gets in the car with her friends, and she's not sure how to start the car yet.  Whatever. 
[00:38:00]  She starts the car, starts rolling too far.  Car starts coming.  She doesn't know it.  She panics.  Right through my garage.  Right through the garage door.  Nice way to sneak.  The garage door comes down, and she's like, I didn't know what happened.  It's just broke.  It's just three, four more kids.  I guess it's broke.  You fell for that one about two years ago.  I fell for it for a while, and then I thought, oh, no, they're lying again.  Isn't it fun when years later you come forward with some of these stories to your parents? 
[00:38:30]  All of a sudden, your brain says, they're lying.  Yeah.  Right.  You think I'm a big Met fan, which they do suck.  What do you think of Piazza's new hairdo?  I have a hard time defending myself against the diehard Yankee fans.  Dude.  Give me an F.  Give me an A.  Give me a double G.  Must I continue?  Nice hair.  D-double-E-K. 
[00:39:00]  Dick.  Come on.  Man.  Well, anyway.  Help us out.  Get that hair back to normal.  First time we moved to, we moved down to Florida in like 86, 87.  First time I come down there, I moved back to New York.  First time I come visiting back, you know, we got our dog Mookie.  The Mets are playing the Cubs.  I don't realize our neighbor is from Chicago.  Right?  What was she on?  What was whoever?  Tom and whatever her name is. 
[00:39:30]  We're on in Chicago right now.  She's watching.  Hey, what's up?  It's all right.  Make sure it's a nice story.  No, God.  Hey, tomorrow rules.  So, anyway, she goes like this.  She goes, whatever.  The Mets hit her, whatever.  They score some runs or whatever.  She opens up the sliding glass door, and she goes running out into the patio area.  I'm like, what the hell is she doing?  She runs to the fence of the neighbor's yard.  Take that, you goddamn Cubbies fans, and go back to Chicago where you're from.  The Cubs suck. 
[00:40:00]  Where did I go, Mookie?  Am I exaggerating?  No.  Strike three!  If there's a bag called...  This dumb guy is from Chicago.  They pay him off.  That's what monsters are from, Chicago.  And they're paying off the damn Cubbies.  They do.  They do.  They do.  Started in the brave.  Yeah.  We all know that.  Die-hard Mets fan, huh?  Yeah, that's true. 
[00:40:30]  Sorry to hear that.  Too bad.  We're having a tough year.  It's a tough year for the Mets.  We're done.  We're done.  We're just done.  Jim, matter of fact, your office called me, asking if I want to make a ticket from you.  I haven't even called you back.  I can't even give away.  I can't even go in Yahoo.  I'm just so depressed.  I'm going Yahoo.  Anyone want fireworks night?  No.  Hey, McGuire's coming.  Nice.  I'll watch it on TV.  Can't even make fun of Rocker anymore at Shea Stadium.  You can't do anything.  What are you going to do?  Yankees are gone. 
[00:41:00]  There's nothing to do but fight Mexicans.  So why are you guys in town today?  There you go.  Inappropriate, pal.  Mom, why are you in town?  She just visited.  I'm just visiting him, and I decide to come in and try to keep him in line.  Yeah, good luck.  We're just hanging.  I'll tell you.  That's cool.  We're hanging.  We have other moms.  Jam fest tonight.  Oh, yeah?  What's that about?  It's just jam fest.  It's just, you know, it's like a festival.  It's awards and people are jam.  You're hosting it, right?  Yeah.  Can the public go?  Yeah, it's beyond.  Oh, sold out and all that.

[00:51:00]  Including the bowling song  I've never heard it  No one has  We've played it once  It's a great song  If we had it on tape  We would have been able to play  We have Steven Lynch CDs  At this point  We have like three of them  I know  Every song he's ever done  That one didn't make the cut  It's amazing  Is it that bad?  No  Don't answer that please  I don't  You know  I don't remember  The last time I heard it  So I couldn't  I couldn't tell you  It's a bit unorthodox  It's not the usual  You know 
[00:51:30]  I do remember  After the show  When we went to the office  Opie went  Dude what's with that bowling song  Hey wait man  I've taken enough abuse today  Come on  I've got everyone else  Hating me in the room  I think I came in  And I was looking to fill  A little time  Right  I dug into the bag  Of old old songs  And that's just one  I came up with  I kind of liked it  I you know  I've been known to toss that  Big heavy round ball  There were some good  Obscure bowling references  In the song  It's chock full of 
[00:52:00]  Bowlers  Chock full  ABC  You know  Were there references to that  Thing that blows the air out  To dry your hands  No I missed that one  Damn it  It's like my favorite part  Of bowling  A ball return  Well  Damn  Do we do the bowling song  Ed  I would hope eventually  I would have thought  Steven would have had enough beers  Where he wouldn't really care  About doing the bowling song  Yeah what  Where did we go wrong  What happened  You know we got a  I'll play the bowling song  If you want me to play it  It's tripping breakers  But it's your show  You want people tuning out 
[00:52:30]  Forty minutes early  Oh believe me  They will not tune out  They will want to stick around  To the end  So the instant feedback  And phone calls  Can go crazy  At this point  I'm surprised  You and I have friends  What's this you and I stuff  I kind of like the song  Hey  Good cop said he liked the song  What are you going to do  Well it was his turn  Damn it  It used to work man  Don't gag  Don't work  No more  They know all our tricks  Good cop  Bad cop  Lewis actually enjoys  Although I do think  Joey is the driver 
[00:53:00]  Is a ridiculous thing  And you should be ashamed  Of yourself  Lewis actually enjoys  When we make fun of him now  I actually have  One of the many songs  That I've played on this show  That I'm sure you haven't repeated  But  You know  I don't want to  That's the only one  I think that's the only one  Really is that the only one  Yeah  Wow  Like every other one  We've played  It's not even  It's not that bad  I mean it's not  It's not good  But  Some of the other ones  Suck much more  Thank you  That's horrible

[00:58:30]  I was going to acknowledge that  your face was turning red  there was no holding back on the vocals  that's right  it's alright  it's Sally Kramer checking and saying  that is such a long way to go just to say  ball sack  who said that  Sally Kramer  Sally Kramer  yeah that was  that was interesting  she is aware of the line  around which the entire song was built 
[00:59:00]  right  John saying forget the bowling balls  where are the ping pong balls  not only is it bad  it's seven minutes long  oh my god  wow  alright  well some people don't know bowling as much as  as you do  it's alright  I played it for the sole purpose  of  don't worry about it  handing it to you on a silver effing platter 
[00:59:30]  you certainly don't have to make excuses  someone wants to know if you have a curling song  I could  I could  I could  I could update it  it's just naming off all those professional curlers  wouldn't that be something  those are real bowlers by the way  I didn't doubt it  I know  and there's some father and son team there  Weber and Pete Weber  really  the Weber  yeah  and I knew Anthony  Earl Anthony was in that song  Earl Anthony  yeah see  really

Very limited view.  You hear a muffled sound of a sound check.  We got a guy that used to work with you.  Let's see what he has to say. 
[01:55:30]  Bill.  Jim.  Bill.  What's going on?  Who is this?  I used to hang out with you.  One of the first places that you used to play was Feb's.  Feb's in Elmont.  Holy cow.  Remember Rob's band Accelerate?  Wait, Rob, um...  Sis?  Sis?  Yeah.  Siciliano?  Steve?  Wow, sick.  That's when you were just starting out.  Dude, I was like 17 in high school.  You know when you go to, like, the local...  Tonight!  Tonight.  Jackson Rocker! 
[01:56:00]  And you'd come in like,  Oh, my friend Jerry's the bassist.  Do I need to pay the $3 cover?  You and the girlfriends.  And only one guy was able to get alcohol.  And he was drinking in the parking lot.  Or at the diner across the street in February.  Yeah, Feb's in Elmont.  And I would do stand-up.  I was the only guy doing stand-up.  At a rock club.  At a rock club.  I remember my first...  Do you remember the bit I used to do?  Live Aid came out. 
[01:56:30]  It was when...  No, you were doing it like a Nazi bit.  Yes!  That's what I'm talking about.  It was a Live Aid just came out.  And I said, um...  This is my big joke.  I'm like, 17.  I'm like,  Have you guys seen Live Aid?  You know, three people.  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Go ahead, Jimmy!  Woo!  Woo!  Your mommy's there, right there.  The one drunk.  No, that was like the one guy.  No, I had this one chick that I used to be dating.  I didn't even know she was banging the lead singer.  I had no clue. 
[01:57:00]  I'm up.  I'm opening for the band.  Meanwhile, you're three weeks later.  No, no, no.  Uh, different band.  Remember the Warshallocks?  Yeah, it's Christ.  Long Island band.  Well, anyway.  So my bit was, uh...  I thought I was a genius.  I went out and went out and like,  Yeah, did you guys see Live Aid for Ethiopia?  The funniest part is when they threw an Ethiopian up there  and Ozzy bit his head off.  Good night.  Here comes Rockalola.  Rockalola.  For those amount from mine! 
[01:57:30]  You know, my two friends,  All right, bro!  Two more time!  Remember when I walked like a pigeon?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  All right, Bill.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  All right, syndication out.  Hey, Bill, how's it going?  You too.  I played Feb's.  I think everybody did at one point.  Played there, man, years ago  with an assortment of bands at Feb's.  And you'd leave.  Like you said,  there'd be five people in the place,  all your buds.  You'd leave,  and the guy would tell you,  you know,  you owed money for the beer and stuff. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, but you know,  this is called paying the dues, guys.  We've got to stick it out.  We've got to stay together.  Do this.  You know, load in, load out.  What time are we on?  All right, we're on at 11 o'clock,  one in the morning.  All right, man,  any minute now,  we're on stage.  The band's up there  just finishing up their last song.  They're doing the live version of Free Bird.  It's going to be any minute now,  we'll be on frigging stage.  And then you get bands,  especially Long Island bands,  we're notorious for this.  No matter how small the club was,  they wanted like a pyrotechnic show 
[01:58:30]  that the Coliseum couldn't hold.  And there was a band called Rough Cut  that was playing around the island.  I think I remember them.  They set off these charges  and like maimed six people in the front row.  And they sued them and everything.  It was amazing.  But they used to blow these things up  where you would feel a concussion.  You'd leave there like you just came back from the knob.  You'd have like shell shock.  I was at the Rough Cut show.  I don't even know where I am anymore.  The horror. 
[01:59:00]  The horror.  Do you remember Night Ranger?  No, not Night Ranger.  It was like Night...  How many local Long Island bands  with Night in there?  We're Night Fire.  Night something.  We'll take Night  and then just pick another name.  Dude, Motley Crue.  Did you hear Home Sweet Home?  Dude, the same dude  that talked to a producer.  We wrote that song, man.  We're in total arrangement to sue them.  Because that was our song.  You know, Poisons Every Rose.  Dude, don't you remember last year  we had to roast them?  They stole it. 
[01:59:30]  We're going to L.A.  We're going to start some crap.  It ain't funny, Dick.  I really wrote it.  Me and Tommy wrote  we were high out of our brains.  And you know, my brother,  you know, he works at the record store.  A guy came in the other day  that talked to a guy  that worked as a cleaning crew  for the record company.  You're lying.  So now we have an in.  So we're getting our tape together.  Dude, I don't believe you.  I swear to God.  Two years.  I swear to God, man.  This time it's going to happen.  This time it's going to happen.  Let me see it. 
[02:00:00]  Let me see it.  You know, it's people like you  that people down.  You know, I'm sure Navrana  at some point  had the same deal.  Oh, I'm going to be  in my friend's basement.  Let me see it.  I'm going to jam to  the streets.  Dick.  Let me see it, Dick.  I see you said  the last three weeks, Dick.  And when am I going to jam with you?  It's like Spinal Tap.  It was just that  constantly went on.  You'd hump equipment  in the winter  to play for 20 minutes  and run no one. 
[02:00:30]  And then you go across the street  to the diner.  Yeah.  Run to the diner.  Across the street  and you'd just shout  out like eggs with ketchup.  Dude, how killer.  Dude, we rocked, man.  Oh, dude.  Yeah.  Freaking.  Dude, but the frigging,  you know something?  The mistake you made  during Driven,  you know, man?  Dude, that was Tommy's mistake.  He missed the symbol.  That wasn't me.  No, I heard a bass.  That wasn't me.  I heard a bass eff up, man.  It was a bass eff up.  No, it wasn't.  Tommy was just trying  to help you out  and compensate for you.  You're off time  if you showed up 
[02:01:00]  at every rehearsal  instead of banging  that damn chick  that you with now  because she's screwing up.  Your head hasn't been  into the band  since you hooked up  with that chick.  Dude, you wouldn't even  be in this band.  How many times you...  All right, name a song  you wrote.  Name a song you wrote.  Okay, okay.  What about Desire?  What about Driven?  I wrote at least  the vocals on Driven.  I'm leaving.  What about...  I'm leaving.  What about Touch?  What about Stand?  I wrote them all.  Where were you?  Whatever, dick.  She's driving your life, man. 
[02:01:30]  And, you know,  we'll go on to stardom  and you're just going  to be working  in the Sears paint department.  So you just stay there.  Okay?  It's having a...  We're flying.  You're dying.  It's too real for you.  As you take the hand truck,  load it into the equipment  through the snow,  walk away two minutes  and your amp is gone.  Because the great local band  spirit of togetherness,  if you left something  without a pair of eyes on it  for two seconds,  the other local band  would steal it.  Mother...  I swear to God.  Dude, I can't tell you how many times... 
[02:02:00]  Who stole the freaking hand truck?  I can't tell you how many times  I pull up late  to see, like,  one of my friends' band  and you always see...  And everyone had their hair  down in here.  Yeah, yeah.  You see the one kid  just smoking a cigarette.  Not good, man.  What's the matter?  Not good, dude.  That's not it.  They took a freaking  Marshall head, man.  They took the Marshall head, man.  I'm going to work overtime  in stock.  I'm already working  in Sears and Stern.  I can't afford a Marshall.  You know what that is? 
[02:02:30]  God, man.  It's just bloody, man.  It was that fact  from White Fire.  White Fire.  It's his name.  Flashback for Anthony.  Yeah, believe me.  I was there, man.  We've got to take a break.  We are so late.  We are so late.  Jim Brewer  making us all laugh today.  Our phone number,  212-757-1027.  We've got to take a break.  Okay, yeah.  We are really late.  We're real late.  All right, we'll be back.  Coming this spring 
[02:03:00]  on the Elk, Elk and Anthony show.  Bikini Softball 2.  The return of WOW.  Jim Norton's World Tour.  Sex for Sam.  WOW stuff.  All coming this spring  on the Opie and Anthony show.  N-E-W.  The Opie and Anthony show.  1027.  W-N-E-W.  On the phone.  Andrew Dice Clay.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, which way now?  What?  What's that?  What?  What'd you say?  Which way?  Medium or well done? 
[02:03:30]  Anthony explained.  Which way?  Anthony explained that whole thing  the other day.  Which way?  Anthony explained what?  Which way what?  No, not which way what.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  All right, medium.  Nah.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Uh, well done.  Eh.  Well.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  I got to know.  The way I like it.  Medium rare.  Yeah, right. 
[02:04:00]  You see what I mean, O.P.?  What does that mean?  That's what you do now.  Which way, medium or well done?  It's a simple question.  That's what you do now.  But why rare?  Uh-uh.  There's only one answer?  Which way, medium or well done?  O.P., you're a smart guy.  Which way, medium or well done?  Medium rare.  Yeah, right.  How come Anthony knows the answer?  That was me who knew the answer. 
[02:04:30]  O.P., I've got to know now.  Yeah.  I only ask one more time.  Which way, medium or well done?  Uh, medium rare.  Yeah, right.  That's me twice in a row.  What does that even mean?  Dice, what does that mean?  How do you like to say it?  It's simple.  It's self-explanatory.  Why do you even ask that?  And why is medium...  What's so good about medium rare?  Yeah, right.  Medium rare is where it's at.  I understand.  What are you talking about?  I understand perfectly.  What if you like medium well because of the mad cow disease? 
[02:05:00]  Or the foot and mouth thing?  Eh.  No, huh?  How do you even know what I'm talking about?  I don't know what you're talking about.  You say medium...  Now you're guessing something that you don't even know what you're getting involved in.  I just know...  This is where I stand now.  I know I like...  See, that's where it falls apart for me.  I know I like medium rare.  You're right.  Well, what are you talking about?  All I did was ask a question.  Yeah, it's an insane question.  I haven't talked in a while.  I was thinking about it. 
[02:05:30]  I call in.  I say, which way medium or well done?  And you're going, that's the only way you like it?  Dice, what about you?  Which way you like?  How do you like it?  How do I like what?  How do you like it?  You didn't ask the question.  Medium or well done?  No, you didn't ask the question.  How do you like it?  No, that's not it.  How do you take it?  No, which way?  Medium or well done?  Which way?  Which way?  He doesn't even answer.  No, I ask the question now.  Which way?  Medium or well done, Dice?  No, no, I said it.  All right, medium rare. 
[02:06:00]  All right, let's knock it off.  I haven't talked to you in a bad...  But we want to know...  I want to know how you like it.  Yeah.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Well, you.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  You're not saying it right.  How do you...  If you're going to ask a question, you've got to say it the right way.  Dice, which way?  Medium or well done?  That's where it pulls apart for me.  I don't mind answering the question.  Which...  But you've got to say it the right way.  I got it the right...  I got it the right way.  Hubba, hubba, hubba.  Dice, I got it.  I got it.  Here it is.  All right, go ahead.  Which way do you like it? 
[02:06:30]  No, no, no.  Right?  Dice, which way?  Medium or well done?  Medium rare?  Yeah.  No.  No, I said it to you.  You said what?  You said what to who?  No, I didn't say this is where I stand.  That's what I said.  All right.  Listen.  Yeah.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Well done.  No, you've got to say it quick.  Well done.  Eh. 
[02:07:00]  That's a nah on that.  Medium rare?  Medium rare?  That's a nah.  Medium rare?  That's a nah.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Medium rare.  You're right.  You see what I mean?  No.  No.  How did you understand that?  You're insane.  How am I insane when you didn't know the answer?  Why do you just start a conversation?  Which way?  Why is it that every time I call you, I ask you a simple thing and you don't have a simple  answer?  That it's got to turn into a whole thing.  I don't know what's wrong with medium. 
[02:07:30]  Tyson, I have a feeling you have problems.  I don't have a problem.  You have a little problem there.  But I had a nice weekend.  You had a good weekend?  Yeah, I was in Vegas.  My butt butter was flying all over the joint.  Everybody was laughing.  You know what I mean?  What's butt butter?  Huh?  Butt butter.  It's radio terminology for Benoit Ball Blaster.  You know what I'm talking about.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, I think.  Yeah.  All right.  So what'd you do?  Because remember you called me for that love advice. 
[02:08:00]  Did I call?  I called you to say hi and you weren't home.  No, not you.  What?  No, you called me.  I was in Vegas.  Right.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Medium or error, obviously.  Right.  Yeah, okay.  You see what I'm saying?  I see it now.  You know, but I told Anthony I was in Vegas.  All right.  So isn't it funny you called me when I was there?  Well, that means Anthony and I aren't communicating.  I didn't.  How come?  What's going on?  I didn't know you were in Vegas.  You called me.  By the way, Dice, who gave you my number? 
[02:08:30]  What do you mean?  How did you get my new phone number?  I moved.  I had to reach out.  How'd you get it?  I had to reach out.  To who?  Not to who.  To what?  Who gave you my number?  Because I left strict instructions not to give Dice my new number.  He didn't give me anything.  Who gave it?  Rick?  Who?  Gave you my new phone number.  He's the doctor.  You know what I'm talking about.  Come on now.  Why can't we ever get anything straight?  Why is he the doctor?  Who's the doctor? 
[02:09:00]  Rick?  Rick?  Who's the doctor?  Guys, who gave you my phone number?  It's a simple question.  I had to reach out.  Reach out to who?  Who?  No.  Who wouldn't even know?  You understand?  And I'm not doing a routine.  That's his name.  I thought you were doing a little Aberdeen Costello there.  No, doctor who?  Doctor who?  Yeah, but he don't know you.  So I don't know where you'd bring him up.  I think Rick gave you my number.  No, Rick didn't give anything.  I haven't even talked to Rick. 
[02:09:30]  It wasn't me.  I reached out.  That's all I'm saying.  That's all I'm allowed to say over the air.  All right.  You know what I mean?  I don't know who could have gotten the number.  If we learned anything through history.  Keep quiet.  I'm on the phone.  Can't you see I'm talking to somebody?  Get out of here.  Who's that?  My wife.  She's a nice lady.  Huh?  Yeah, but she's starting to end.  She came in.  She wanted keys for something.  Who was it?  Norton?  No. 
[02:10:00]  A boyfriend.  Who was it?  Jay Moore gave you my number?  No.  Oh, your number?  You're still on your number?  Yeah, who gave the number?  Was it Jay?  Let me ask you this now.  Jay Moore did.  Let me ask you this.  Yeah.  Okay?  Why?  Why are you asking me now?  Because now I want to know who gave you the number.  For an hour you call me up.  How do I keep things going?  I know you're with the same girl for years.  Call me up.  You remember?  Guys, I wouldn't even know where to call you.  What do you mean you wouldn't know where to call me?  You call me all the time.  I wrapped up in a thrilling game of EverQuest, and you call up, and I have to cradle the phone 
[02:10:30]  in my shoulder so I can play.  EverQuest, after you get naked during that game.  It's not a naked game.  It's not a naked game.  You were playing this with your girlfriend?  It's online gaming.  Were you playing this with your girlfriend?  It's on the computer, guys.  Yeah.  Was she playing, too?  No.  And she was fully clothed.  She didn't take nothing off.  Yeah, what am I supposed to have, sex when Dice is on the phone?  No, no, no.  Jesus Christ.  You've got to go, and I'm like, fourth way for you, you know.  What an erection kryptonite that is.  What you've got to do is think about me, and everybody gets excited about everything. 
[02:11:00]  I can't even have one of your movies on the TV on the couch when we're trying to go at it.  Why not?  Because you're like a erectile kryptonite.  You look up all of a sudden, hey, that's a good one.  You throw a one for me, okay?  And that's all you're thinking.  But that's all it's about.  That's all marriage and relationships are about.  That's what's bad, though, about having people in show business that you know.  Because, yeah, are you ever trying to do something on the couch with your girl, and all of a sudden, I turn on Comedy Central, and there's Adam Ferrara. 
[02:11:30]  Hey, pal, I see your ass.  You're naked, pal.  You're going to want to see that.  Yeah, but it's like you remember all my life.  It's Jay Moore in a dress when you watch me.  You know, which is kind of hot.  But, you know, you don't want to sit in there while you're trying to get your F on.  Are you trying to say Jay Moore in a dress is hot?  I don't know if he did his own makeup.  I want to ask.  Say that again.  Adam Ferrara isn't Diamond Dice Clay. 
[02:12:00]  Well, you can say that again.  You've got to know how to keep it going.  That's all I was trying to explain to you that night.  Who said what?  You know what I mean?  No, I didn't say who said what.  And who had nothing to do with it.  You know what I mean?  That's a whole different situation.  When you say, you know what I mean, I can always answer no.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  So, you know, you've got to constantly keep balls coming at them.  That's all I'm saying.  You've got to be on them from the minute they move in with you.  You can't let them.  So I bring them in the boom closet.  And I'm going, oh, look, it's not rising the way I would like it to. 
[02:12:30]  Do me a favor.  You know what I mean?  Caress it a little.  And then when it's done, go feed the turkey to the family.  You know what I mean?  Not at all.  You know what I mean?  They wake up in the morning.  What's the first thing somebody does?  They wake up.  They yawn, right?  Sure.  So the banana goes right in their mouth.  You've got to be prepared.  You've got to sleep with your head at their feet.  So when they hug you in the middle of the night, the banana goes right in their mouth. 
[02:13:00]  You see what I mean?  That's romance.  That's showing a girl, I'm always thinking about you.  Of course.  You know what I mean?  You send them a nice card.  Remember when you drank my goo from a cup?  I'm sorry.  Please, let's make up.  That kind of thing.  You know what I mean?  Sure.  Romance with dice.  And it's always just coming at them.  They don't breathe.  You break the light like in the shower or something so when they get in in the morning, you're already ready.  You're like in the corner.  You know what I mean?  Hey, good morning. 
[02:13:30]  Bend the cat over here.  Now you're a filthy animal.  Hey, dice.  And then you say to her when it's all over, right?  Yeah.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Medium rare.  Right.  Now you understand.  Dice, I've got to be careful with this.  Dave on line eight, he wants to know if you've had a stroke recently.  What?  What happened?  What?  I'm actually coming in there to see you guys soon again.  Yeah, I hear that.  You got a call waiting because something clicked in there.  I have to tell him how handsome he is. 
[02:14:00]  I haven't told Dice how handsome he is.  Oh, I am getting beeped.  So I have to call him and tell him he's handsome.  And why is the guy using my yambag line?  We love the yambag.  The guy that called in.  No, we came up.  We've totally stolen yambag.  Yeah, we came up with it.  Have you really?  We'll fess up to it.  Yeah, we stole it.  Do you understand how difficult it is to keep coming up with terminologies for you?  Dice, we came up with that one.  No, I came up with that.  When the yambag is banging against the hairy taco. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, remember when you were in here?  You remember?  And that was our line?  Remember when we were saying yambag and you took it and then you used it the next time you were here?  Yambag is mine.  Yambag is ours.  No, yambag is mine, my friend.  No, you got butt butter.  Butt butter is yours.  Butt butter is yours.  Yambag is ours.  No, no, no.  We can trade if you like.  We'll take butt butter and you can have yambag back.  Yeah, but you ever made a chick with assitis?  What's assitis, Dice? 
[02:15:00]  You get it from mad cow disease.  I never heard of assitis.  What are the symptoms?  Well, you know, it's like faggotitis.  Only if you go with a cow.  I don't get it.  Get what?  What is it?  It's a disease.  It's spreading from the whole mad cow disease thing.  Hey, you know, yambag was mine, you son of a bitch.  Yeah, all right.  Wait, don't start with the buttons.  You're stealing from a puppet.  Don't start with the buttons.  I'm a puppet.  Get in the coffin.  Get in the coffin. 
[02:15:30]  All right, stop it.  Die.  Die.  All right, stop with the buttons.  I hate when you do the buttons.  Die, get in the coffin.  You know how I hate the buttons.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Medium rare.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Faggot.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Medium rare.  Yeah, right.  Don't forget, my friend, yambag is ours.  No, yambag, you know what?  I'll give you yambag.  How's that?  And we're going to take butt butter, too, if you don't watch it.  No, you can't take butt butter.  I can't keep coming up with these things. 
[02:16:00]  You know, like...  Hey, why don't you take leather Cheerio, too, you thief?  Stop with the noise.  Stop with the noise now.  Get in the coffin.  I haven't talked to you for a while.  I'm sorry.  I better put some butt butter on my...  I can't even say the word that I was looking for.  Leather Cheerio.  How's it?  Asoleen.  Asoleen.  You like that one?  You want that one?  I'll take that one.  All right, but I want yambag back. 
[02:16:30]  No, we're going to trade for that one.  I'll trade you asoleen.  We'll give you a yambag.  Asoleen.  Trading my material, sir.  Trading mine, sir.  Get in the coffin.  We'll take asoleen.  Asoleen's nice, right?  Yeah.  Asoleen.  We'll give you butt butter back.  Like if you're having that kind of...  How do you say it?  Anthony, say it.  Like what I mean.  What?  You know, like if you're having that...  If you're having that kind of backdoor action.  Yeah, like backdoor action. 
[02:17:00]  Now what are you giving her?  Asoleen.  Asoleen.  Yeah.  Well, no, you need the asoleen before you do that.  No, no.  No, that's a different thing.  That, you know, that's spit.  You know, Asoleen is what comes from your three-piece set.  Asoleen, that's a good one.  No talent, faggot.  George.  Who's this?  What do I got to deal with this?  That's George from Otto and George.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Are they up there?  Yeah.  That's not nice.  He's a little shy, though. 
[02:17:30]  You ever see him, the puppet guy?  I haven't talked to him in a while.  Yeah, wait.  You'll lose my number.  Lose it.  No, he's not.  This is sampling stuff.  Because Otto does talk once in a while.  He doesn't want to talk today.  How come?  I don't know.  You want butt butter back?  We'll take Asoleen.  You like it?  You're thinking about Asoleen.  You could have the butt butter back.  You're thinking about Asoleen.  You know what?  I'm going to give you some time to think about this.  We keep Yam Bag.  We keep Banana Juice.  No, Banana Juice is mine. 
[02:18:00]  Well, no one knows that anymore.  Banana Juice?  What are you talking about?  It's on the album.  We've used it so much, now they think it's ours.  So we're going to keep that one.  See, you're going through a whole thing today about respect, so I understand where you're  coming from.  Just take Balloon Knot and take the trifecta.  All three.  Get in the coffin.  We'll give you...  We can trade you F-Tard.  No, that's no good.  I've got to keep Butt Butter.  I've got to keep Asoleen.  I'm going to give you Yam Bag, because that's getting kind of old.  Keep them all, sir.  Who cares?  No, you get Butt Butter back. 
[02:18:30]  That's not the puppet.  I know Otto and George, and I know what a stupid puppet sounds like.  What am I doing that?  It's not the puppet.  It's the puppet.  I know what the puppet sounds like.  The puppet came in here, and the puppet is...  He's not, and it's not the puppet.  That's not what the puppet sounds like.  The puppet has the flu.  Let the puppet say something.  The puppet came here without Otto.  It's just George.  Now, he doesn't want to say anything.  You insulted him.  That's not the puppet.  That's Madam. 
[02:19:00]  Who's Madam?  Whaling flowers and Madam?  The puppet they used to put on television.  That guy's dead as a doorknob, isn't he?  Yeah, but the puppet's not.  Hey, that's funny.  You calling me a faggot?  Oh.  I'm no faggot, sir.  All right.  What?  Is it Otto?  Is that you?  Otto's not here.  George is here.  Just the puppet.  It's just the puppet.  Otto couldn't make it.  Just the puppet.  See, that's what happens with every great team.  Sooner or later, they start arguing.  They break up. 
[02:19:30]  One wants to go their own way, do their own stuff.  You know what I mean?  It's amazing that the puppet is here by himself.  Now, I know what you're saying.  Yeah.  He's over there.  I'm over here.  And this is where I stand, because that's where it falls apart for me.  He's a junkie.  Die.  That's not Otto's puppet.  That puppet is way too mean.  That puppet's got a death sentence.  It's the puppet.  It's not the puppet.  It's the puppet without Otto.  I know my puppets, my friend.  It's not the puppet. 
[02:20:00]  It's the puppet without Otto.  I know my puppets.  And we're keeping banana juice, and we're keeping, what was the other one?  You've got to remember now.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Now I've got to confuse you.  Which way, medium or well done?  Medium.  Rare.  Uh-uh.  No, you can't split it.  You have to have the single answer.  We tricked you.  Ah, see?  We tricked you.  Medium or well done.  That's a way to trick you.  We just tricked you.  He said medium.  I said rare.  That was the right answer.  You didn't get the answer, my friend.  That was the right answer. 
[02:20:30]  No, that wasn't the right answer.  I didn't give the answer.  You didn't give the answer.  It's the response you're going for.  Here, let's do it normal now.  All right.  All right, because then I'm going to go.  I'll let you do what you've got to do with what you've got.  Okay.  Okay?  All right.  Medium or well done.  Your ass smells like hot garbage.  No, wrong.  Wrong.  Hot garbage.  Brinsed mustard.  I'll give you a crack over your frigging head.  You'll be part of my fireplace.  You don't shut your mouth.  Eat me, sir.  Eat me.  Eat me, sir.  That's all I got to say.  Eat me, puppet. 
[02:21:00]  All right.  Let him finish, man.  Okay.  All right.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  All right.  You ready?  Medium or well done.  Get in the coffin.  No, wrong.  Medium or well done.  Muzzle George for a minute.  We've got to finish with him.  Kill yourself.  No, George.  Kill yourself, sir.  George.  Ah, pussle.  George, relax.  Ah, pussle.  Is that a work in that puppet?  Yes.  He is there.  Yes.  It's not just the puppet doing his own thing.  Well, it's just the puppet. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, you're a real whiz.  Stupid son of a bitch.  All right.  Go ahead.  Die, die, die, sir.  All right.  Let's, uh, die, die.  I just got a lot of pent-up anger.  Don't you feel that?  Dice.  Everything's very negative.  See, I call in all happy.  Dice, explain.  Because you're a retard.  Give us the question.  Happy as a retard, sir.  Well, that's one puppet's opinion.  Dice, give us the question.  No, no.  I'm not doing it. 
[02:22:00]  I did it ten times.  You didn't do it right.  But the puppet got you pissed now.  No, but, you know, just the fact I'm having an argument with a puppet.  Don't let the puppet get you pissed.  No, no.  But the puppet's, like, hurt my feelings.  It keeps saying things to, like, uh, like what we're doing.  All right.  We'll keep the puppet out of this.  Go ahead.  All right.  All right.  You ready?  Yeah.  We want to finish on it up now.  All right.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Eat my ass.  No, see?  He did it again.  That's not right.  You know what I mean?  And I feel kind of stupid talking to something that really doesn't even exist. 
[02:22:30]  You know what I mean?  I want to hear Otto's voice.  I don't care if he talks a lot.  I've got to know it's him because that's the only puppet person I talk to.  He's not here.  Just George came in.  I don't understand this.  What happened with them?  I don't know.  It's his new thing.  It's just he sends George out and he stays home.  It's his new thing.  Kind of like that whole medium rare thing.  And this is what Otto's doing now.  He went out to buy crack and the pigs ate him.  Heffin' junkie.  Let me ask you guys. 
[02:23:00]  Does he ever talk like as him?  No.  He never talks?  Not lately because this is the new thing.  This is what he does now.  Just the puppet.  Yeah, just the puppet.  He normally asks the puppet questions.  No, he's just looking at us now and the puppet is kind of like looking.  No, he asks the puppet a question and the puppet answers.  That's what he used to do.  That's usually what happens but he's not here so now the puppet's just on his own.  Right.  You know what?  The puppet needs Otto back because he's getting very angry.  The puppet's eyes are just moving around the room. 
[02:23:30]  What's the problem with the puppet?  The puppet's not getting enough work?  See, the puppet needs Otto.  Well, George is doing fine on his own.  Right.  No, I don't think George is doing too good.  I'll tell you the truth.  The puppet's doing fine.  And why are we referring to an inadequate object as a person?  Look, I don't know, Dice.  Why would we do that?  I don't know.  Okay, look. 
[02:24:00]  Why would three mature adults like us do that?  Sure.  All right, finish up.  All right, you ready?  Yeah.  All right, here we go.  I got to gear up.  Okay.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Why is nothing happening when I say that?  I was thinking of the answer.  What do you mean you were thinking of the answer?  I taught you the answer.  Oh, all right.  We've gone over this a thousand times today already.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Ah, pussah.  No, wrong.  All right, the brain-damaged leather-clad freak.  You see what I mean? 
[02:24:30]  Here he goes again.  The puppet just keeps getting angrier.  It's not my fault the puppet don't get work.  I know what Otto's thinking.  Otto's doing like the teller thing, you know?  What's Otto doing?  He's working, day job, the whole thing?  Otto is like doing teller now.  Doesn't need to talk.  Giving BJs for crack money.  I can't believe he won't talk.  Otto, is that you or is it the black puppeteer guy? 
[02:25:00]  It's just the puppet.  No, there's another guy.  There's Willie and his puppet, whatever it is.  Oh, my God.  Willie and his puppet.  The black puppet.  Willie and Lester.  Willie and Lester.  Willie and Lester.  The black puppet guy.  You ever hear those guys?  That's a puppet act.  That's a puppet act.  That's a puppet act.  He makes that puppet talk out of every hole in its body.  I kind of like the peanut guy.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Does Otto know Willie and Lester?  Did they ever get together, double date, that kind of thing?  I don't know.  Maybe when Otto comes in, he can tell us. 
[02:25:30]  You want to ask George, though?  The black puppet robbed me.  I'm not talking to the puppet anymore.  Well, he's talking to you, though.  I didn't talk to Otto, but I won't talk to the puppet.  The black puppet robbed me once, sir.  What happened?  The black puppet robbed me, sir.  Did the black puppet rob you?  That's what he said.  Because he's doing real good.  All right.  All right.  Look, I don't want to fight with a puppet.  Okay.  You know what I mean?  Well, we have to take a break.  All right.  All right.  Take a break.  Which way?  Medium or low done?  Medium rare.  You're right. 
[02:26:00]  That's what you do now.  All right.  He hung up.  He hung up.  Holy smoke.  Is it out of his mind?  The guy's lost his friggin' mind.  What is that?  Dirty.  Oh.  Can I see your taint?  Nice.  Taint?  Nice.  Taint?  Nice.  Between the peach and the blue knot.  Can we see your butt?  Nice.  I would have to just blank on your chin.  Does this guy know how to party or what? 
[02:26:30]  Okay.  Terrific.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  1-0-2-7-W-N-A-W.  Now, is she not right?  Is she insane?  Well, she now run from a life on all the time.  It's the day.  Is she not right?  Is she insane?  Well, she now run from a life on all the time.  Now, is she not right?  Is she insane?  Will she know? 
[02:27:00]  Come on, I'm like, come on, I'm gonna end this day.  How she know, right?  How she is, hey?  Will she know?  Come on, I'm like, come on, she might have it.  Gorilla Boy.  Hi, guys.  Oh, great white gorilla.  Don't destroy our village.  Hey, let me ask you something.  Are martial art tattoos considered a prop?  No.  No?  Not unless you're...  If not, I'll get skin grafting.  Now I'm a prop comic.  Somebody kicking someone's ass is a prop. 
[02:27:30]  Hey, Jeff.  Maybe you can do that.  That's a good one.  Jeff, just in case you weren't listening earlier, Anthony called you a hack.  I did not.  Really?  I try to bring the character to life, right?  I'll leave the Archie hat home.  What do you want me to tell you?  Hi.  Hi.  Now, what happened?  All right, first of all, I just want to tell you guys that I am forever in debt to you guys  because if it wasn't for you, I would be...  Now, listen, and the Port Authority cops, if you're listening, thank you. 
[02:28:00]  You guys were very nice.  I was on law and order.  I said a law and order yesterday.  Yeah.  I'm driving home.  This little...  You got the dumb button ready?  No, don't say...  Don't care.  No, okay.  These two white trash punks cut in front of my truck don't realize there's another car  in front of me jam on a brake, so naturally I do.  All my stuff goes forward, and the fake 9mm lands on my dashboard.  Now, what are you doing with a fake 9mm in your car?  I told you.  I was a cop on the set of law and order.  Yeah, but usually they don't let you take the props home with you. 
[02:28:30]  No, no.  It's my own.  I bought a cop uniform and the whole stuff.  Wait a minute.  All right.  There's a lot going on here.  You get a part on a TV show, but you have to buy your wardrobe and your props.  No, what I did was I went out and I bought it through this acting school and took headshots  and submitted it to these different cop shows, because I always said, people told me I could  get a cop role.  So anyway, here I'm thinking it's a lucky break, and this kid cuts me off, and everything 
[02:29:00]  goes flying, and the gun and the nightstick and everything lands on my desk.  But wait, wait, wait.  We've got to slow you down again, though.  Why would you have the prop gun?  I mean, why would they allow you to bring your own prop gun to the set of law and order?  Don't they have that just laying around?  Well, they do have stuff, but I had my own, you know, I had my own stuff.  And since you were taking the pictures for this, so you could submit them to the shows,  why would you have to then take the stuff with you? 
[02:29:30]  They like you.  In other words, I guess it enhances your chances of getting on or getting lines or what have  you, because I guess it's like a prepared, like you go to school with a pencil.  Schools have pencils, but you bring your own.  Yes.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  So everything goes flying forward.  Right.  So with this, me, with my psycho temper, I yell at the kid.  The kid throws a...  Can I back up again?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Go ahead.  Jeff, are you feeling left out? 
[02:30:00]  Haven't been on the show in a while.  Need to come up with a good story for our show?  No, not at all.  Just checking.  Not at all.  All right.  The story just seems a little fishy.  All right.  Go ahead.  Now that I feel like a total a-hole.  No.  I want to hear the rest of this.  Now we need to hear the rest of the story.  Holy Christ.  You know, I have a lot of friends, but I think the one thing I question is you.  Oh, Frosted Mini Wheat.  Don't destroy our village.  Frosted Mini Wheat.  Now, anyway, to make a long story short, they thought it was a real gun. 
[02:30:30]  They freaked out.  They pulled their guns on me.  They found out who I was.  Everything was cool.  And the Port Authority cops are good people.  Well, because the cops came, and then they look in the car.  They treated me like Rodney King.  I got cuffed.  I felt like an idiot.  And I told them I was just, you know, I said, I'm an actor.  I swear to Christ.  Gun partner.  The one cop knew me from the show, and he said he was a big fan, and they were really  good guys, and I wanted to thank them.  They're good people.  And I don't feel left out from the show. 
[02:31:00]  Gun partner.  Oh, Jeff, I was just kidding.  You know we are.  I know.  I'm only teasing.  I'm only teasing.  And I'm not plugging nothing, so don't worry about it.  I see you're a lying scumbag.  See?  See, Jeff?  See, Jeff, you have the problem?  Next time someone goes to kick your foot at Caroline's, I'm going to walk away.  I wanted to see the guy get beat up.  Yeah.  See, Jeff?  And you're abusing me.  I didn't push that button.  I meant to push the foghorn leghorn.  And what would he say? 
[02:31:30]  I see your lying scumbag.  Okay.  Thanks, guys.  What the hell were you thinking?  And you got another button you want to push over there?  When you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea.  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener.  No, that wasn't me.  That was Oprah.  Oh, okay.  Whatever.  Yeah, we'll play that game.  Please don't hurt me, old big white gorilla.  I love when he does that.  Oh, man. 
[02:32:00]  You know what?  Someone is defending you, though.  So why don't we talk to...  Oh, yeah, I'm sure this is sincere, too.  No, I think it is.  Matthew, I think?  Or Matthew?  What's up?  Yeah, I don't know.  Hey.  Yeah, I just want to, you know, help him clear it up a little bit.  A lot of...  I do extra work myself.  And what happens is a lot of these extra actors, you know, if you have your own props,  your own wardrobe, it makes it easy for you to get roles.  You can bring your own stuff.  It'll give you actually money.  More money to bring your own wardrobe and stuff like that in.  So I see a lot of these guys on Law & Order, you know, they bring in their own props. 
[02:32:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, right.  Yeah, I'm going to get it, too.  All right, Matthew.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Oh, yeah.  More it.  More it.  Hunter it.  Jeff, that guy, you know, defended you.  I know.  So you have audio of the cops when they rolled up to Norris' vehicle.  It's got it right for us!  Melanie, what's going on?  How is it possible that when you're driving, you stop short, stuff lands on top of your dashboard?  Because I was doing 40, and I had a jam on the brake. 
[02:33:00]  Where was this prop gun?  Yeah, but how does it jump up and land on your dashboard?  That's a good question.  Yeah.  Because I had a garment bag over my passenger seat, and everything flew forward.  Flew forward and up?  But on top of the dashboard?  I'm thinking...  I've got a big truck, sweetheart.  I'm going back to my...  Yeah, but I drive an SUV, too, and I don't see how stuff can fall on top of my...  Wait, I'm going back to my physics class.  Yeah.  Can you jump up and forward at the same time?  Sure.  Yeah.  Maybe you hit a bump.  It's like the Kennedy assassination.  It would, yeah.  It's the magic gun nightstick theory. 
[02:33:30]  Went forward and to the right.  It's like impossible.  No, it's not impossible.  Well, I mean, the chances of that happening...  Melanie?  All right, go through.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Let me talk to Melanie.  Melanie?  Yes?  Have you ever seen Gorilla Boy?  No.  Just say, okay, I believe you, Gorilla Boy.  No, but I don't.  If I have stuff in my passenger seat and I stop short, everything comes on the floor.  Nothing has ever flown up and landed on the dashboard.  Yeah, but, sweetheart, your dildo in the front seat wouldn't land on the dashboard. 
[02:34:00]  They're lying, because it's impossible.  That's a joke, son.  Don't you get it?  You're the inspiration for Twin Beds, you dirty whore.  Thank you.  All right, Melanie.  Oh, my God.  I forgot to play a cop.  Right.  Hey, Paul Mercurio in the studio, Jeff.  Yeah.  Say hi to Paul.  Hey, Jay, Paul.  How you doing, man?  Hold on.  Let me get rid of Melanie here.  He doesn't...  This is turning out to be a really good segment.  I like this.  I'm trying to figure it out myself. 
[02:34:30]  Another actor on the phone, Jeff.  Another Jeff.  Jeff.  Yeah.  What's up, man?  Not much.  I'm on my way to an audition now, and I got three dead whores in the trunk.  But it's okay.  I'm playing a psycho.  Yeah, it's okay, though, because you're trying out for a part.  Yeah, but you got him in the trunk, so that's good.  Dude, I mean, the cops stopped me before.  No big deal.  All right.  Thanks a lot, man.  Hey, Gorilla Boy?  Yes, sir.  For the record, I believe you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  Come on.  Oh. 
[02:35:00]  I know.  When are you going to be on Law & Order?  I think...  I don't know.  They shoot it...  I shot yesterday.  I'm on it today.  I guess it airs...  I guess it takes, like, three weeks.  Yeah.  It's Special Victims Unit.  I don't know when.  It ain't no major big thing.  It's just...  Yeah, that's cool, though.  You're a mini-week, God damn it.  Yeah, that's right.  I'm the first at mini-week.  He's more than that, too.  He gets tackled in that Stacker 2 commercial.  I saw that one, too.  He was running during the XFL stuff.  Well, if I can...  I did get a part in a movie, so that's one thing I will say.  What movie?  I'm in a movie, start shooting next week called... 
[02:35:30]  Fantasia?  Huh?  Nothing.  It's called I'm with Lucy.  It stars Monica Potter.  Who's that?  Why don't I even tell you guys this?  Hey, no.  Wait, wait, wait.  John, wait.  He's in that movie with Morgan Freeman, Along Came a Spider.  Oh, yeah.  Why are you getting mad and saying, why do I tell you this?  You know what?  Let me tell you something.  Here we go.  Now I'm going to friggin' talk.  First of all, okay, you got every ever comic on there, and they're all great. 
[02:36:00]  I'm not saying that.  Hey, Jeff, don't do a Billy and Paul on us here.  I'm never going to do that.  I'm your friend, but I'm saying, how come you allow every other guy to call and plug  and come in and say anything, and I call, and it's like, die, die, get in a coffin.  Gorilla Boy, you just plugged for 20 minutes.  That's good stuff.  I didn't plug.  I was telling you a life-threatening story where I trapped myself.  And we're entertaining the people.  The phones are going crazy.  Look, Sarah wants to say hi to you.  Hold on.  Oh, Christ.  You ought to put the good call through. 
[02:36:30]  Of course.  Look, Sarah, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Did he also have to get stitches on the side of his head because the motorcycle went into  his car?  My car intern.  Okay, look.  Yeah.  Remember our old intern?  No.  Jeff, look.  I didn't know she was going to say that.  That's all right.  That's all right.  Vinny from Rosedale saying, hey, Norris, when Santa and the Easter Bunny come over, tell  them I said hi.  That's not me, though.  No, that's cool.  I still believe in that.  That's cool. 
[02:37:00]  All right.  Hold on.  I agree with Gorilla Boy.  I'm an extra in porno movies, and they recommend you bring your own junk.  Nice.  That's pretty good, man.  Hold on.  Pete's found a hole in your story.  One?  Pete, what's up?  Oh, Pete.  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  Hey, listen.  First of all, this guy's a clown.  He's got an SUV, right?  No.  He's got one of these monster trucks, basically.  All right.  Check this out now.  He says that the bag was sitting on top of the passenger seat, right?  That's still way below the dashboard, guys. 
[02:37:30]  No, it's not.  I mean, it's got to climb up.  Inside of a Dodge Ram, you can't.  Time out.  Yeah, time out, tough guy.  You might be big, but you're stupid.  You're a jerk, bro.  You're a jerk.  You're a big goofball, man.  Let me tell you something.  I drive an SUV.  We're getting to the bottom of this.  Wow.  Let me tell you something.  I drive an SUV myself.  I'm in one right now, and I'm telling you.  I got a double bag.  Thank you.  You win.  You win.  You win.  Man junk.  You talk like that from swallowing.  No, no.  Your mother had me up on life, bro. 
[02:38:00]  I'm in a truck.  I deliver pizzas for Domino's.  I have no life, so I have to go on Opie and Anthony and talk to Norris.  No, but you got a life.  You auditioning with a cop suit in your car to get a role on Law and Order, but you got  a life.  That's right, my friend.  Let me tell you.  I'm not going to be a company, bro.  You don't know me.  You don't work in a corner.  All right.  Go back to your hole, bro.  All right.  All I'm going to say is that if he's got a duffel bag on the...  Hold on.  You can't both talk.  It's Jeff's brother, everybody.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is he done?  Can I speak for a second? 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, go ahead.  Speak for a second.  Okay.  What I'm saying is that if the duffel bag's on the passenger seat, it's still way below  the dashboard.  There's a midget in this duffel bag pushing it up.  It's not coming up that far.  What are you, come on, bro?  Come on, bro.  Come on.  You were running last Tuesday.  I hate to bother you.  I can't believe that you're questioning this.  I've seen this happen before.  There was an episode where Martin Landau was driving, and I believe he hit somebody,  and a gun flew up and fired and hit a guest arm over the Amsterdam. 
[02:39:00]  It could happen.  It killed your dog, Lieutenant, didn't it?  It killed my dog, and Mrs. Colombo.  All right, Morris, I'm willing to believe your story.  There's just a few holes.  Pardon me.  Can I ask you one more question?  I understand gravity and physics.  So what dimension was this, sir?  You were dressed in a cop's uniform. 
[02:39:30]  Correct.  So you're in a police officer's uniform.  No, I wasn't in a uniform.  That's true.  Yes, you were.  No, I wasn't.  I actually have the Dodge website up.  I am looking at the interior of a Dodge Ram to see how high.  You really think I'd learn.  Instead of calling you guys, you really think I would learn.  It actually has an asterisk.  It says, do not put 9mm fake gun on passenger seat on bag when going to be extra at. 
[02:40:00]  It has a tendency to jump up onto the dashboard.  It goes up and to the right.  It's all there.  It's small print.  Got to read it.  Here we go.  I'm looking.  Wow.  Jeff, you didn't have a tryout in the new Matrix movie, did you?  No.  The Matrix.  All right, I'm looking.  Oop, what do you think?  If something is on the seat, do you think it can go up?  Anthony, you know how big a seat is in a truck? 
[02:40:30]  I'm looking at the seat of your truck.  That's where your head sits.  Yes.  Okay, that's where it was drooped.  It was drooped over the top of the seat.  Oh, oh, oh.  So it was over the back of the seat.  How do you balance a gun on the back of a seat?  Yeah.  No, the bag.  It was in the bag.  It still had to get out of the bag, though.  Yeah, it had to get out of the bag.  It has hands and unzipped.  It was in a garment bag.  It's the David Blaine of guns.  It put itself out of the bag.  Oh, shit.  That trick's going to be on ABC next week, as a matter of fact, right? 
[02:41:00]  Good.  I am going to stand in a block of ice.  And a gun will fly out of my...  And then there will be a tornado of fire.  And I will deny my sexuality yet again.  Who am I?  David Copperfield.  I like that they put grease on his eyebrows so they wouldn't singe.  It was like 32-gallon drums of grease on his eyebrows.  I'm sorry.  I'm getting you off on your tangent.  That's okay.  Gorilla Boy?  Yes, sir.  You know we kid because we love.  Oh, shit. 
[02:41:30]  Then you guys must be madly in love with me.  Nick must fantasize about me at night, then.  Come on.  If you kid for love, then I've got to be the most loved guy.  Come on.  This is too good.  We couldn't pick on Earl today.  We had to find somebody.  Yeah, he took a beating the other day.  All right, fellas.  I've got to get out of here.  Good talking to you.  Do you have any gigs, Norris?  Am I allowed?  Sure.  After that beating, of course.  Next Thursday and Friday night at Caroline's with Jim Brewer.  Hey, nice.  Yeah, and I was looking forward to working with Jay, but there was too many comics, so I got 
[02:42:00]  the bump.  But I'll be on the show next Thursday and Friday with Brewer at Caroline's.  And come on in and say hi to us next week, all right?  Will do it.  Thanks, fellas.  You're best.  All right, Jeff.  Bye, man.  Jeff Norris, Gorilla Boy.  It was like that episode with William Shatner as the magician.  Remember that one?  All of a sudden, guns are flying out of garment bags and whatnot, landing on dashboards.  It was just like that episode.  Let me get this right.  At the time of the shooting, you were having dinner with the gun.  Is that correct? 
[02:42:30]  So it's on the back of your seat in a garment bag.  Suddenly, the brakes are applied, and it flies right through the plastic.  The gun stops.  It has a sip of coffee on the way to the dashboards.  I hear the gun was chipping golf balls the whole time.  Now, your neighbor says you like to take walks on the beach with your gun.  Is that correct?  The prop gun.  I hear for years, Bill Shatner walked around with a phaser. 
[02:43:00]  He had to have his own phaser with him during the Star Trek series.  Let me just say this, Captain Kirk.  The phaser flew out of your ass.  I hit Mr. Sunu in the head and continued toward the viewing screen.  You know those big gloves during the games to the Triskelion?  William Shatner supplied those.  They were actually candy dishes from his own house, I do believe.  And the spaghetti colin, the monster from Lost in Space.  That belonged to a part of the cast. 
[02:43:30]  That was young William's.  The spaghetti colin, but what a blisp I got.  We have to take a break.  Paul Mercurio in the studio.  And Di Nicola.  And Mike Di Nicola.  Hey, everybody.  Mike Di Nicola.  He's in the bad seat, though.  I can't see it.  Yeah, I know.  The bad seat.  He's behind that big, huge computer screen.  Watch out for flying firearms.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You know, seeing these beautiful women here reminds me of the very first love of my life.  Okay.  My mother. 
[02:44:00]  Not your mother.  All right.  I'm going to sing about her.  All right.  I lie next to her in the bed.  She's the kind of girl I like to wed. 
[02:44:30]  Never mind the fact that she's dead.  It turns me on.  It turns me on.  Sure.  She's a little cold to the touch.  But that doesn't bother me much.  Because the embalmer did such a lovely job.  She's a month dead and she's starting to smell. 
[02:45:00]  But if loving a corpse is a sin, I'll see you in hell.  And now, I've got her propped up in a chair.  She's losing her skin and her hair. 
[02:45:30]  And I'm wishing that she wouldn't stare so much at me.  So much at me.  Yeah.  Rigor mortis is taking his toll.  And her body is as stiff as a pole.  But I'll never put her back in the hole.  So I dug her from, I dug her from. 
[02:46:00]  She's a month dead and she's starting to smell.  But if loving a corpse is a sin, I'll see you in hell.  I love you.  Steven Lynch, everyone. </pre>
