[00:30]
 1027WNUW.  I'm a-lovin' on Tuesday night.  I'm a-lovin', it feels so right.  I got my girl down on her knees.  Wonder if he will do me.  Hummer's gone, Keishan is gone. 
[01:00]
 Oh, what, we love Tuesday night.  Hummer, Hummer, Hummer, Hum-oh!  Tell me more, tell me more.  We don't care where we are.  Tell me more, tell me more.  Do it right in the car.  Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah.  Boo-boo-boo!  Something to me, I drop my pants.  You owe this to Opie and Anthony.  I'll call them up when you go down.  All the heels are slipping sound. 
[01:30]
 Hummer's done, get me some gum.  Oh, what, we love other night.  Tell me more, tell me more.  I don't mean to offend.  Tell me more, tell me more.  Now can you do my friend?  I exploded, that's where it ends.  I have got the world's best girlfriend.  I love to be in his lap. 
[02:00]
 Think it's time I took a nap.  More.  Hummer's done, there's more to come.  But, more.  Those hummer, now. 
[02:30]
 There is more, there is more, more. 
[03:00]
 We refuse to be responsible.  One, oh, two, seven.  WNEW.  Ah, yes.  It's Opie and Anthony Shue.  Hey, how are you brother man?  Very well.  It is Tuesday.  Yes, Tuesday Hummer Club.  Open for business.  Yeah, look into, induct new members into the Tuesday night Hummer Club.  Yeah. 
[03:30]
 So get hobbin'.  Right now.  Hob, knob, knob, hob, knob, hob, knob, hobbin' the knob.  Saw a little bit of the Hummer Club going down on the TV screen in the office.  Jesus Christ.  You know, this job rules man.  What other job do you go to and just hang out in the office for a little bit and watch porno? 
[04:00]
 Box O Porn sent to us.  Let me tell you guys, we know you love us, we appreciate it.  But I'm almost ready to say that I think we've reached our quota in porno.  We're running out of shelves.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't know how this started, but you know, the faithful listeners, they get a porn tape and they want to share.  Of course.  So they pass along to us and we really appreciate that and stuff.  Today, like Aunt just said, we got a Box O Porn. 
[04:30]
 How big is the box?  It's got to be so they can visualize.  Like, you know, three feet.  Three feet across, two feet deep. Is that accurate?  Yeah.  I mean, it's a huge box.  We open it up and there's got to be 30 to 40 porno tapes.  Pornotapes. So we put them all up on the shelf.  And now the salespeople are coming into the office and we're renting them out now to the salespeople.  We are officially renting porn from our office.  We're like Blockbuster, but instead of the BL, it's a C. 
[05:00]
 That's what we call ourselves.  And we put a sign over the door.  And we're renting it out now.  You know, if all this continues, we're going to make more money just sitting in our office than actually doing a radio show.  Yeah.  Between all the stuff we got going on.  We don't charge late fees. We come to your house and kick you in the nuts.  That's right.  And take the tape home.  How many pornos do we have on that shelf, really?  I couldn't even tell you.  I mean, I brought at least a dozen home to my house.  You have. 
[05:30]
 I was wondering where some of those went.  Come on.  I'll bring them back.  Oh, like you're going to miss them?  Have someone go down and count how many pornos are in our office right now.  Yeah, but there's some good ones.  And then there's some homemade ones.  Pretty sick.  The homemade ones are a little out there, but...  Watching a scary one before.  Brian?  Skinny little white guy with his white girlfriend.  And he opens up the door and lets this cute little guy in.  He's got a Louisville slugger. 
[06:00]
 And he watches a Louisiana black snake in his pants.  And he was just watching as Mandingo did his girl.  And he's getting all weird in the background.  It was a little disturbing.  He's like, yeah, ever, ever, ever.  He liked that.  That was pretty sick.  Well, Brian wants us to like him a little bit.  But he's like, yeah, I'm going to do it.  He's like, yeah, I'm going to do it.  He's like, yeah, I'm going to do it.  He's like, yeah, I'm going to do it.  Well, Brian wants us to like give away the porn.  Hey, Brian. 
[06:30]
 Yeah, how you doing?  Great.  You guys got too much porno spread around a little bit.  It's not a bad idea.  We're always looking for prizes to give away on our radio show.  We can basically take the porno off our shelves and give them to you guys.  Exactly, why not? It'd be a good contest.  I mean, it was hilarious today opening up the box-o porn today.  That's it.  I mean, half the tapes in this box,  they're in the middle of the porno.  Some weren't even rewound at all.  Some weren't even in boxes. 
[07:00]
 Some didn't even have a label on the tape.  So those are the homemade ones.  You just have to pop it in and see what comes up.  Literally.  You didn't have any problems getting any of them out of the box.  They weren't all stuck together, were they?  No, we were a little paranoid about that.  We had some gloves on.  Bye, Brian.  Hey, Wes, love you guys.  Bye.  Like Mark was concerned.  It's like, oh my God, look at these tapes. 
[07:30]
 Oh, don't touch them.  It's like, well, wait a minute.  The tape is the safest thing to have.  The tape is in the VCR while you're doing whatever you're doing.  So it can't really get any on it.  I don't know what...  The listeners are freaking out.  They all want porno now.  John!  Hey, how are you?  I'm good.  I'm good.  I'm good.  I'm good. 
[08:00]
 I'm good.  I'm good.  I'm good.  I'm good.  I'm good.  I'm good.  I'm good.  I'm good.  I'm good.  I'm good.  Alright, you guys are the best.  Alright, John.  That's what we've got to do though.  We have to get some Kung Fu tapes, some Karate action flicks. 
[08:30]
 That's what they do now.  A flash dance tape, just throw it in there, whatever.  It doesn't matter.  That's what all the porn shots have to do now.  60% of their stuff has to be legit.  Non-porn.  So they have this advertisement for a Kung Fu film festival.  Like you're going to walk into a peopland  so you can see a Kung Fu film festival.  I don't think so.  You're in there looking for some meat curtains.  Yes.  I think we have more porno in our office than most of the sex shops. 
[09:00]
 Most of the porn stores?  Oh yeah.  And adult toys too.  We got that fake vag.  We got the hoppity hop wiener ball.  Which for some reason is always at the side of the desk.  Underneath the desk.  I'm not so sure.  I'm not so sure.  I'm not saying anything.  I'm just wondering why it's always over there.  It's actually on your side of the desk today if you really want to get into it.  Kick it right back where it belongs.  The love doll.  I got hiccups now. 
[09:30]
 And someone drew a map of Hawaii on the love doll's map.  Did you see that?  There's a map of Hawaii on her back.  And then on the front it says your mom.  We're not sure whose mom it's supposed to be.  And someone stuck a Mr. Hankey keychain.  For the Sundown chain.  It's pretty disgusting.  Well that's why we're here Anthony.  Yeah I guess so.  We're in the same boat.  So there you have it.  Pretty much we could open up a sex shop.  In the back there. 
[10:00]
 We got the DVDs.  That everyone sends us.  We have the penthouse DVD.  That's fine.  Everyone is asking can I have some porn.  I'll take some porn.  We can give our porno away.  Scully.  We had this great porn section.  There was this one in there.  I swear it was called Opie Goes to South Central.  Yeah I saw the cover of that tape once.  Opie comes from Wisconsin.  Goes to South Central.  All the black pimps try to cheat about that. 
[10:30]
 You're cursing now.  It's kind of hard to talk about porno without cursing isn't it?  Yeah.  Much in serious apologies.  You guys gotta check that one out.  I know a bunch of you guys have sent that title to me.  I gotta check it out for the hell of it.  By the way, John Famiglietti said to say hi.  I don't know if you remember him or not.  John who?  Famiglietti. I don't know. He's from Brentwood.  Brentwood?  I don't think I know anyone from Brentwood.  I just usually drive through there with my windows rolled up real fast. 
[11:00]
 Same thing with wine dance.  Yeah tell me about it.  Well thanks for your time guys.  Thank you.  Brentwood. I used to work in Brentwood I think.  So you probably know.  Maybe I did.  What an ass.  Oh my god. We'll get into that next.  We got a little blurb in the daily news about the rock.  The croc.  Yeah.  We have to take a break but Ben's got me the article.  We'll talk about that right after commercials.  Stay right there. 
[11:30]
 Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Should give out our phone numbers.  212-757-1027.  If you have anything for the program.  Our fax line is working just fine.  212-957-9639.  We like hearing from you guys  if you're being inducted into the Tuesday Night Hummer Club for the first time. 
[12:00]
 Yes.  And if you are, congratulations.  Well the daily news.  Oh I got fired.  Can a week go by without the papers  writing something stupid about the radio show, Anthony?  Yeah, that's a good thing.  We don't care.  No, honestly we don't care but I'd like to point out the  the stupidity of some of these articles.  Yeah.  David Hinckley.  I actually kind of respect.  I don't think he really gets or likes our show. 
[12:30]
 Yeah, well I think he's very  skeptical.  You know?  He's very skeptical as to what  goes on in this show.  What is real.  But the thing is, everything's real.  Honestly everything is real on this show.  We don't fake anything.  Can you honestly think of one thing we faked?  No.  If a listener could come up with that, I'd appreciate hearing that.  Because I can't think of one thing we have done since moving to New York that has been fake.  That we faked.  I mean, we've been faking. 
[13:00]
 That was a put on.  For the sake of good radio.  Pretty much what you hear is what happens.  And I'm surprised David Hinckley who  writes the radio column for the Daily News hasn't  figured that out yet.  Well, you can't really blame David.  I'm going to take the blame off him and put it on the  wacky DJs.  Because he's not used to  reality in radio.  Reality based radio.  Right, if something happens,  if something's big, if something makes 
[13:30]
 some noise in this town,  it was probably a set up or fake.  He's not used to things really happening.  Like what happened here,  The Rock came in, got upset,  and walked out on the show.  Correct. Well, in the radio dial  section of the Daily News,  David Hinckley writes,  The Rock. Many listeners found it  riveting when WWF wrestler The Rock  walked off the Opie and Anthony show in WNW.  Thursday after the arrival  of Sickboy, whose wrestling website  posts with racial insults. 
[14:00]
 Racism in entertainment and on  the web? Question mark? Good  subject. Except that WWF  is a set up and so is a lot  of Opie and Anthony. God  damn does that piss me off.  What's wrong with him? If he's  going to say that, why doesn't he list like a bunch  of things that we have done on the show  that he is convinced is a set up?  Name one thing we've done that is a set up.  Yeah, go ahead, David.  Kimma. If you're going  to make a statement like that, then give me  an example. Something I can touch and feel 
[14:30]
 and go, oh, I remember that.  And then we would explain to you why it wasn't a set  up.  Except that the WWF  is a set up and so is a lot. A  lot of Opie and Anthony.  A lot would mean  pretty much everything we do.  Yeah.  Someday people will get what we do.  Remember the time we walked off the show in the summer?  People thought that was a set up. Like, why would they risk  their jobs? Yeah, that was fake. Because we really  believed in what we were doing that day and we were that  pissed that we were willing to like get fired. 
[15:00]
 Yeah. But they're like, oh, that was just a publicity  stunt. A fake. To get listeners  and stuff.  No one ever believes us.  It's a running gag for  regulars to laugh at rubes who get all  outraged as if it's real.  What?  Ah.  That's not true either.  However, since you're an act  and however legit an issue,  you're still in a room where the first 
[15:30]
 commandment is take nothing  seriously. Well, that makes sense.  Sure. We don't try to take anything  seriously on the show. You're right. Wear a goof.  The rock's a goof.  So like what is he getting all  serious with his  racist issue  on a goof show when he's a goof  show. Right. All right. That I could understand  what he's saying. See, I guess  the thing to say at this at this  time is what happened last Thursday  with the rock and it and I was  very, very, very uncomfortable 
[16:00]
 and very real. And  to be honest with you, that type  of radio is not going to happen on our show  very often. No, because we don't break it. We're against that  uncomfortable and that real where  we pretty much,  I don't know, break out of our radio  persona, if you will, to really  try to discuss something. Yeah.  And then the, you know, the crybaby, the  croc, you know,  walks out of our show.  Corky Rock!  Walks out of our show.  Racist. 
[16:30]
 Walks out of our show after I told him, you know, we had  nothing, nothing to  do with the comments on  Sickboy's wrestling site. Yeah.  And still the rock walked  out without saying goodbye. Dwayne.  Dwayne Johnson without discussing  it further. He's a crybaby.  I'm sure Sickboy was happy, though.  See his little name in the paper there  and it's all in bold type like the rocks.  Yep.  That's pretty cool. Well, the rock is  even thicker print than Sickboy,  but the rock says, 
[17:00]
 I'm a crybaby.  Hypnotizing  with stage. That, okay.  Dave. How you doing, guys?  All right. I'm not saying  the hypnotizing was staged, but I do,  I can give you some idea as to why  someone would think it was staged. Okay.  He had Spaz hypnotized,  right? Correct. And every time  he  said something or did something,  Spaz was supposed to act like a farm  animal. Right. Yeah.  And he didn't say, he was supposed to, he was, he was 
[17:30]
 supposed to make a different farm animal noise.  Okay. Now, is it just a coincidence  that every time he did something,  Spaz did a different  farm animal noise?  Like, he never repeated the same  farm animal. He would always  go into a different, it was like he was searching  and towards the end, it was like he was  trying to think of a different farm animal. Right.  You're right. You know something? But  Dave, I don't believe the  hypnotizing thing. Oh, okay. I don't  believe it either. I really, I  totally did not believe it. I'm 
[18:00]
 still extremely skeptical. I  was being courteous and  cordial to the hypnotist when he was here,  but I don't, I don't buy it. I  don't believe it. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,  Kazay and I are on the opposite  sides of the fences on this one.  Yeah. I completely believed  it, but I also  decided I have to ask Rick a ton  of questions. I asked Rick enough  questions, and Spaz enough questions after  the fact that I'm convinced what happened  happened. I'm still not.  So you think, so you think Rick and 
[18:30]
 Spaz pulled one on, pulled one over  on us? Yeah, they would just like to believe  maybe. Rick was believable.  Rick was believable, but Spaz,  it was just, it was just too,  it was like, it was too perfect.  You know what I'm saying? Why would he do  what? Every time he, every time he had to  do a farm animal noise, he came up with a  different farm animal. They were truly  hypnotized, and they'll, and  the hypnotist didn't say anything  that he had to make a different farm animal  noise every time. I think just,  I think just, I basically think Spaz 
[19:00]
 blew it, and I can see where  a guy like David Hinckley is going to listen to  that skit and say, alright, that was staged.  Because no one's going to expect  Spaz to come up with it on his own.  They're going to think that you posted to do it.  If that was staged, Aunt and I weren't even in on it.  And that's what, there's no way  it was staged, in my opinion. No way.  I believe that you believe that.  Oh yeah, without a doubt.  Because I asked Rick enough, I even said  Rick, we're not on the air anymore. I mean, that was  pretty freaky, what was going on there with the hypnotist.  And he goes, dude, I swear, I barely 
[19:30]
 remember, you know, being in the  studio doing all that crazy stuff.  And Spaz swears up and down to things all the time.  Well, I mean, Spaz, you know,  I believe Rick. I don't believe Rick would lie,  but Spaz is full of it.  Well, Spaz is not a good liar either, though.  Wait, hey, good liar.  I didn't say he was a good liar. Get Spaz real fast.  I said he's a liar.  But the fact is,  we don't stage stuff on this show.  I wasn't buying it, though.  That's not really, no, you're right.  That's not the kind of setting up. 
[20:00]
 That's not the kind of setting up for the skit.  And even if you do stage stuff,  it's making people laugh. Who cares?  Your job is to make people laugh.  Well, there's an integrity. I mean,  believe it or not, an Opie and Anthony integrity.  We don't like faking and staging stuff.  There's a lot of radio shows  that do do that.  Oh, I've done stages half everything.  And it should be obvious to you guys when you're  listening to the radio, what is stage and what is real.  And I'm telling you right now,  I'm challenging you guys today to come up with something  that you are convinced we staged, or 
[20:30]
 you know, thought it was fake or something.  You're not going to find one.  I think the Spazz hypnotist,  I don't think that  Spazz, a lot of people still think  We're in such a deep hypnosis.  All right, well, Dave, we got Spazz in the studio.  All right.  A lot of people, Spazz, still think that  you know, you faked that whole thing  when you were hypnotized and you were in  cahoots with the hypnotist.  And you and Rick were in cahoots with the hypnotist.  No way that was possible.  And I think he would listen back when we replay it 
[21:00]
 from time to time. And I look back at the video.  He says when he tells me to do the barnyard  animals to switch it up a bit and don't do  the same ones.  So looking at the video when I saw him say this.  Yeah, but then you should have been  able to just really fast  rattle off different barn animals.  It sounded to me and to Dave  like you were trying  to, like you were thinking of a new one.  Trying to think like as he was talking,  you're going, OK,  I'm going to need a new farm animal in my head.  And then he would just say 
[21:30]
 something and you would go into the farm  animals. I don't remember doing that at all.  And I think what has to happen is you got to get hypnotized.  No, it wouldn't work.  Just think it'll work.  I think when you're under hypnosis,  you still have to think. And let me tell  you something. It would piss off the friggin  hypnotist. I know that you know how the hypnotists  are. They come to the radio shows. They want  subjects that will work.  That they can work with.  That it'll be fun to listen to and make them  people go to their shows.  Yeah, picture me 
[22:00]
 going into the back here.  He hypnotizes me. Nothing happens.  I walk out. I'm fine.  He knows it. He sees it in my face.  Like I'm not going to play along.  And he goes, oh, it didn't take on him.  Well, he did explain that there's  a trust factor.  You have to believe because you have to like, you know,  you have to like close your eyes and really concentrate  on what he's doing. I would do everything  he said. And you know something, it still wouldn't  work. I'm not going to go quack, quack, quack.  I don't see how it possibly  happens. Not to the extent that that guy 
[22:30]
 was doing it. There is a percentage of people  that just doesn't work on it.  Did they get the voodoo in you?  I don't know exactly.  I believe it. I don't understand  how it goes down. But I believe it.  These guys are so friggin powerful  that in a few  minutes of being alone with somebody,  it was like a half hour to forty minutes,  they can totally  take over their friggin mind.  How about, why aren't there  more criminals that are hypnotists, that hypnotize  people, that are maybe bank tellers? 
[23:00]
 And put a subliminal thought in their  head, when I go in the bank, you're just going to  give me a big bag of cash.  Then how else do you explain what  we saw with Rick? It's a gimmick.  It's not a gimmick, I ask Rick. I go,  man, you know, I'm like Rick, tell me.  Is this fake?  Are you in cahoots with a guy? He swore  to me he didn't even remember acting like a three year old  trying to grab a quarter out of my pocket.  He was having fun.  He was being involved with the show.  No!  No, I will not accept that. 
[23:30]
 A certain percentage of these  people that get up on stage at these shows  and do things with the hypnotists,  they will play along. That's what  the hypnotist knows.  They're exhibitionists. Right, right.  Why do you think we get people that  come up on stage at our  live shows and do anything?  Because they want to be part of the show.  Rick doesn't need to be part of the show that bad.  He loves being part of the show. You can't keep his  mouth shut when he's in front of the freaking mic.  Jesus Christ. Unfortunately,  we can't get Rick out because he's in London, but 
[24:00]
 I'm telling you, Rick would have told us by now  if he was in cahoots with a guy.  Maybe he actually wants to.  No, no, no, wait a minute.  I don't believe Rick would tell you.  Here's why.  Listen to the logic, okay?  Rick is truly dedicated to the show.  He bends over backwards for the show.  If he tells you that he was in cahoots with the guy...  That makes for better radio.  And that's why Rick would  fess up and go, alright guys, I conned you.  It would make for better radio  if that's all we're worried about. 
[24:30]
 I'm telling you.  I think he'd take it to his grave that you guys can continue to believe that...  Nah.  Because a lot of the bits that do work for this radio show  is bits that go wrong  or go off the track.  First of all, he came out from the back room looking like he was on heroin.  He wasn't even like hypnotized.  That was scary!  He was acting, Opie.  He was acting.  No, no, no, no.  He came out looking like he was on heroin.  His arm was shaking.  His eyes were half-masked. 
[25:00]
 His mouth was open.  He looked like he was ready to start drooling.  Because that was how he thought  we would want to see someone that is hypnotized.  From years of watching cartoons.  If that's the case, then Rick should move to Hollywood.  Because he's a great actor.  He's a great actor.  Because I'm telling you, the stuff I saw  when the camera or no one was focusing on him,  he was still hypnotized as a three-year-old staring at a quarter hand.  Why aren't there more hypnotist criminals?  It seems so friggin' easy  if you walk into anywhere.  You hypnotize someone, they give you what they want. 
[25:30]
 Hypnotist.  It's not going anywhere as long as you're in the car.  It's not going anywhere as long as you're in the car.  It's not going anywhere as long as you're in the car.  It's not going anywhere as long as you're in New York City.  How could you do shows?  How could you find time to do hypnotism shows  if you're a hypnotist when you could be getting laid  24 hours a day?  You go to a bar, you see the gorgeous looking girls.  You hypnotize them before you know it.  Wah, wah, wah.  So it's Tuesday every day.  So you think all those shows are staged  and everyone on stage is acting and they're really good at it? 
[26:00]
 Absolutely. No way.  I think there is legitimate hypnotism  and I think it takes  a long time of laying down,  relaxing for things like  maybe to quit smoking,  to cut down on eating.  Or remembering something from the past.  Right, something that's in your mind already.  You can't make a sane human being  with a half hour of coaching  in a room  act like a chicken.  The people that really legitimately do that,  they're not going on radio shows. 
[26:30]
 Not that there's anything wrong with that.  But those are psychiatrists.  You have to be responsible.  You've got the power of someone's mind.  You can't just go around really being the one.  But also the hypnotist also has to find things  you would probably do if you weren't hypnotized.  I mean if all of a sudden you told Rick  under hypnosis to have gay sex,  I don't think he's going to do that.  I think that's part of it as well.  I mean the hypnotist finds things that  this person would normally do.  Oh, and spaz is a prostitute?  Well, I mean to get me to give very high 
[27:00]
 and very low rates of hypnosis.  And to get me to give him money  for sexual favors.  You know something?  That freaked you out!  It freaked me out because if he was even kidding around  No, no, yeah.  Without any hypnotism involved,  if a guy is just kidding around with you like that,  it freaks me out.  I guarantee you he gets...  Spaz, come here!  I'll prove it to you.  Spaz!  Anthony, reach for all these groin. 
[27:30]
 I want to freak out.  Grab that mic.  Remember when you were hypnotized after you saw the tape?  Yes.  You discovered that you were like a prostitute  and you were flirting with ants?  That freaked me out.  Okay, try to do that right now.  He's not going to do it because it's not part of the act.  It's part of the show.  Look at him.  There's no way he could even attempt to do it now.  Try to act like a prostitute  and he's your best customer.  Act like a prostitute and he's your best customer right now. 
[28:00]
 Go ahead.  See?  I couldn't even dream of doing that.  But under no hypnosis whatsoever,  he played a gay guy getting his schwanza done up  by another man on a stage.  Because what?  Oh, there was an act!  But you can't act now.  Because he's not under hypnosis.  He wasn't under hypnosis at his gay play.  And he acted like a bag?  Act like a prostitute and answer best customer.  What did he do?  See, right now he's bolstering his hypnotism act 
[28:30]
 by making like he couldn't do that.  Dave, you are 100% right.  Give Dave a friggin' prize.  Dave, go on hold. We'll give you something.  I like you.  You're wise.  Let me plug my website.  What's your website?  World'sGreatestParty.com  Alright, thanks, Dave.  I agree with Dave.  We will agree to disagree.  I completely believe what I saw was  because of the guys under hypnosis.  Without a doubt. 
[29:00]
 Without a doubt in my mind.  You saw Spaz's face.  There's no way he could act that out with you  if he wasn't under hypnosis.  He acted with another man in a play  without hypnosis.  He's able to do it.  He's totally able to do it.  And I know Rick well enough off the radio show,  what I saw when he was acting like a three-year-old  is just no way!  For the show.  See, when I was sitting to see,  I was under hypnosis so much 
[29:30]
 through the back of my mind I could do it  because I've acted in that sort of a thing  because I've sat down, in acting you sit down  for like three months to sit down and plan it.  Because I've been in a gay play, so to speak.  It was in the back of my mind.  So hypnosis, I guess he was able to induce that part.  I don't know.  Spaz, I ain't buying it.  You can talk to your blue-eyed guy  I am not buying it.  They have nothing to hide at this point.  We already got what we got out of the radio show.  Now it would make a great bid if he could.  If it was fake, it would be great if they admitted now. 
[30:00]
 Because it would be unbelievable radio.  He won't.  First of all, because you believe it so much.  If you tell Spaz the story is green,  he'll tell you it's green too.  It's not how our show works.  They would have told us by now.  You stop showing the halls fast enough  and you're going to be like,  You stop showing the halls fast enough  and he's doing a prostate exam on you.  It's not how the show works, man.  I understand.  For some reason,  they don't want to come forward 
[30:30]
 and say that,  alright, they were putting it on.  You're high.  I am not high.  Do you pay attention to the people we work with?  And you're still convinced  they're just pulling one over on us  two months later?  Why would they?  I'll get it out of Rick in the office one day.  I tried on many occasions.  You believe it too much.  I'll sit there and go, Rick, come on.  It's not just believing, because I do believe it,  but I also decided I want to do some research 
[31:00]
 and find out some stuff.  The guy would not budge.  He wouldn't budge in the office,  he wouldn't budge on the train on the way home,  he wouldn't budge at a family function.  I've asked him three or four different times.  He is not going to budge.  He would not budge on the train on the way home.  He would not budge on the train on the way home.  He would not budge on the train on the way home.  He would not budge on the train on the way home.  He would not budge on the train on the way home.  He would not budge on the train on the way home.  He would not budge on the train on the way home.  He would not budge on the train on the way home. 
[31:30]
 He would not budge on the train on the way home.  He would not budge on the train on the way home.  He would not budge on the train on the way home.  He would not budge on the train on the way home.  He would not budge on the train on the way home.  He would not budge on the train on the way home.  I saw it in his eyes.  The guy was freaked out that he was doing the things he was doing.  The guy was freaked out that he was doing the things he was doing.  Especially when he was acting like he was three years old.  Especially when he was acting like he was three years old.  Trying to get a quarter from my pocket.  Next time they could hypnotize the both of us.  I don't want to.  Watch you quack around like a chicken and watch me go this side like a bull. 
[32:00]
 I don't want to.  It freaks me out.  I do believe it.  You have the type of personality, I think I have the type of personality too,  that we probably wouldn't go under.  There's a bunch of people that don't go under.  There's no under.  Because there has to be a trust level when you decide to go under hypnosis.  Because there has to be a trust level when you decide to go under hypnosis.  There is no under.  I'm totally saying there is no under.  I don't believe it for a second.  I didn't want the guy getting all pissed off that his shows wouldn't sell.  I didn't want the guy getting all pissed off that his shows wouldn't sell. 
[32:30]
 See then you're a puss.  You should have like confronted him.  Next hypnotist I will.  You live and learn on this show.  I totally don't believe you.  That's a puss move man.  Okay I agree but you live and learn on this show.  That's how it is.  If you didn't believe that much then you should have confronted the guy.  Billy from AirSuit Productions.  Hey guys.  What's up Billy?  Hey Anthony you're missing a big point here buddy.  What?  The fact that you said before that you would expect Spas to start rattling off all these animal noises one by one. 
[33:00]
 The fact that you said before that you would expect Spas to start rattling off all these animal noises one by one.  Being under hypnosis does not make a guy smarter.  Being under hypnosis does not make a guy smarter.  No I'm not saying that because if you listen to the tape he did duplicate a few of them.  No I'm not saying that because if you listen to the tape he did duplicate a few of them.  It's still fat.  It sounded like he was really searching for the farm animals.  Oh I understand.  It's still going to be fat.  It's still in the brain.  It doesn't even matter to nitpick like this about one little part of it because I don't believe any of it.  It doesn't even matter to nitpick like this about one little part of it because I don't believe any of it.  Hey guys look I've been under hypnosis for years for losing weight.  Hey guys look I've been under hypnosis for years for losing weight.  Look how good it's worked. 
[33:30]
 You're not helping my cause Billy.  I actually am.  One thing I actually am.  This Hinkley guy?  What an idiot.  I mean nothing but here's a guy who if he knows so much why does this column get cut back to one day a week?  I mean nothing but here's a guy who if he knows so much why does this column get cut back to one day a week?  Yeah because it's boring as hell.

That's the headline grabber of this column. 
[34:30]
 And if I was Scott and Todd, if that's all David Hinckley has to write about your show, I'd be pretty damn embarrassed at this point.  And if I was Scott and Todd, if that's all David Hinckley has to write about your show, I'd be pretty damn embarrassed at this point.

Would you spend 10 hours to get a snippet of the top 100 greatest rock and roll songs according to VH1? 
[35:00]
 Greatest rock and roll songs according to VH1.  Greatest rock and roll songs according to VH1.  10 hours to get 4 and a half minutes of material.  10 hours to get 4 and a half minutes of material.  10 hours.  That's smart.  Really can't figure why Stern's kicking your ass.  That's weird.  It's like that in fake news.  I thought you guys would be number one.  I thought you guys would be number one.  KJ, Queens, love the show, but I'm pretty convinced that  KJ, Queens, love the show, but I'm pretty convinced that  is that a train bit was staged?  What? 
[35:30]
 How could that be?  You jackass.  Tim, what's up?  I want to say on Anthony's behalf  that Opie, you up?  Everybody always says that Spaz is always kissing your ass.  It sounds like maybe you guys are teaming up and it's all BS.  It's what?  Anthony's right.  There is no hypnosis.  It's all BS.  I completely believe it.  And Rick doesn't kiss my ass.  We're brothers.  Spaz kisses your ass. 
[36:00]
 He kicks your ass.  He hasn't kicked my ass, buddy boy.  I heard it on the radio.  He had a fight club when you talked about his sister.  That's true.  He did kick your ass.  You said Rick?  I thought you said Spaz.  I apologize.  I feel I am the ultimate skeptic.  I feel I am the ultimate skeptic.  We can't be getting the wool pulled over our eyes.  I don't believe in hypnotism.  I don't believe in friggin' Bigfoot.  The Loch Ness Monster. 
[36:30]
 UFOs.  Nothing.  Dave, what's up?  Everything's bull crap.  Dave?  Anthony's full of it.  When he was there and Rick was carcin' up a storm,  he was like, oh, I believe, I believe.  He's full of it.  And my wife got hypnotized over at Governor's.  And at the end of the whole thing, he told him  that if you do this, you're going to remember.  And there's no way unless that guy gave her millions of dollars  that she would have done the stuff that she did.  And have you asked any? 
[37:00]
 Of course, nobody else believes in the Loch Ness Monster.  And it's not a real thing.  I think she was just, she wanted to be part of a show.  So now you think this guy's wife is lying to this guy?  I'm sure the guy's asked her, was that real?  Are you in cahoots with a hypnotist?  That other guy Dave is a mess because the hypnotist told him to make different animal noises every time he made,  every time I sat my finger, you got to make a different animal noise.  And he did it.  Well, he tried.  He's just too stupid to figure out, remember, he thought a dog was a farm animal. 
[37:30]
 I don't think you're getting my point.  It's not that I think everyone that acts like they're hypnotized on a stage is in cahoots with a hypnotist.  I think they're just themselves wanting to be part of a show.  And then they want everyone to actually believe that they were hypnotized so they don't say anything.  So why aren't more people?  What do they get from it?  They get their little part of being a part of a show.  They get on stage, they're the center of attention.  And then everyone loves that. 
[38:00]
 And then they have to shut their mouths for the rest of their lives?  And they don't say anything.  I'm sure some people do.  Not when you get on my tape.  You guys got that delay there.  I've been listening to you.  That's for sure.  My wife didn't fake anything.  He told me when it was done, you're going to remember everything you did.  She still doesn't remember everything she did.  Alright, man.  Thank you.  I would think there would be a lot more hypnotist criminals out there.  Steve?  Yes? 
[38:30]
 From the Underground website?  Absolutely.  Our screen's not working today.  What's up, Steve?  Not much, but just to reiterate the same point 150 times.  Were you not there?  Did you not?  I mean, I have this all on videotape.  You rearing back in pain when Spaz came at you like a little girl?  Oh, I know, but he was acting.  No, he wasn't acting.  This was hypnotist.  He was hypnotized.  Totally not buying it.  Well, I mean, look, when Rick wasn't even on camera and I pan over to him and he's in the corner, curled up, playing with a quarter foot. 
[39:00]
 Yeah.  No one was paying attention to him.  Like, there was a section that, you know, Rick was by himself for a good 10 minutes while we were paying attention to Spaz.  That was what he thought he should do to make it look good.  There's some degree of willingness that goes along with hypnotism.  I mean, you have to be willing to do it.  Remember the two other girls that were there and it didn't work on them?  Right.  Because there has to be a trust factor.  You have to trust what the guy's going to do to you.  So Rick could be turned into a blithering friggin' idiot two-year-old on the floor just from talking to a guy for a couple of minutes. 
[39:30]
 Get out of here.  You are totally understating the law of the human mind.  Alright.  And personality.  They call me stupid.  I believe it.  And how do you go and get hypnotized?  You know, then drag another friggin' quack hypnotist in here to try to hypnotize me.  I will more than willingly, I will go into the room, sit there.  You'll never be hypnotized.  I will do everything he says. 
[40:00]
 And you know what?  I'll come out and go, yeah, bull crap.  No more.  If you prance around like a little girl, I'll be there to get it on video.  Yeah, okay.  See, all I have to go on is I know Rick pretty well outside the show.  I asked him.  He told me the truth.  He has no friggin' clue.  That's all I need to know.  I believe that.  I believe it.  As much as I would ask you something, you'd tell me the truth, right?  Yeah.  Thank you.  That's all I need to know.  And the fact that Rick cursed up a storm and you guys had to make the guy, you know, tell him to stop? 
[40:30]
 He knew we had to lie.  Well.  He knew.  He knew.  That was a great word.  Steve was in Studio 2.  It was a freaky scene, man.  I don't know.  I buy it.  I buy it.  I'm buying it.  All right.  Steve, a couple other things, because we could be on this all day.  Yeah.  First of all, the unofficial Opiant Anthony website, foundrymusic.com.  Heading toward a million hits.  It's going to happen before Friday.  Yeah.  Thank you.  And the site's only been up what, seven months? 
[41:00]
 Seven months.  Since June.  Well, June 4th is when I put the counter on, so.  Nice.  And the other thing, I wasn't able to write you back yet.  Oh, yeah.  You have to put the video clip of The Rock walking off our show.  I got it.  You know, something Rick told me.  Were you still rolling tape after the show ended?  Or his segment ended, hopefully?  I've got to check.  There's a tape that should be arriving at your office pretty soon, because Rick wanted  a copy.  He said, Rick said, hold off on putting it up, because he wants to go after the WWF. 
[41:30]
 Us, Steve?  Yeah.  It's called the Opiant Anthony Show.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  As quickly as possible.  All right.  Well, all right.  Also, also, this is kind of, you know, he's on there too.  So if I get to speak to him and get his approval for it, which I don't know if I'm going to  get.  Well, the part I really want everyone to see, because we have been made to look like bad  guys out of this whole thing.  Sure.  And we made a bunch of calls to WWF, and they have completely blown us off.  After the amount of time we have spent talking about the WWF, I thought it would be courtesy 
[42:00]
 they call us back to discuss this issue.  Yeah.  A ton of free advertising for their product.  Not that they need it, but you know what I'm saying.  I want people, because we were made to look bad, to see the part where we, the show, the  rock segment ended, and I went to commercials, and he got up and left without saying goodbye.  That's what I need people to see.  Okay.  And I hope you have that on video, Steve.  Oh, that, definitely I have.  All right.  Because the uncomfortable moment, I mean, you can put that on as well, but I mean, it's 
[42:30]
 very important to me that our faithful listeners see how much of a crybaby this guy was.  Oh, yeah.  So the rock just walked out.  The guy walking out, not even saying thank you for the 50 minutes of promotion we gave  his book signing and his book before he decided to, you know, blindside us.  You know, someone brought up a really good point the other day to me, and they said,  as I was rolling the tape for them, they said, you know, one day I wish I could be black  so that I could get really indignant at the drop of a hat for stupid reasons. 
[43:00]
 Wow.  You know?  That will stir up some crap.  Hey, Steve.  Huh?  Yeah, I know.  Well, you know something, man, if this guy has been as racially insensitive as Opie was  saying, as he was the other day in the past, and he got that freaked out about it that  he had to storm out like a baby, either it was an act and it was staged, or he's a hypocrite  and, you know, doesn't deserve half the publicity you guys gave him. 
[43:30]
 Right.  I think he was trying to get publicity.  Well, we'll get the clip on the unofficial website, ASAP, if you can find it, and email  is when it's up there so we can tell everybody.  I'm serious.  I want people to see it.  All right.  All right.  Because it's amazing.  You're not going to believe it.  You just wait.  After promoting him for 50 minutes, he'd like, we go to commercials, I turn around to, you  know, say thanks or something to him, and he's getting up and walking out with his back  turned up.  Yeah.  The crybaby, the croc.  Croc, oh, you know what?  Oh, you know. 
[44:00]
 All right, man.  We got to take a break.  All right, man.  Go ahead.  Thank you, Steve.  Talk to you later.  All right.  Brian from Jersey.  Anthony, I'm with you.  My sister got hypnotized, went through the whole show, and afterwards I asked her about  it, and she said it didn't work, but she still did everything the guy said.  It happens all the time.  Oh, that's one person.  I saw it for myself, man.  You're not going to change my opinion right now.  All right.  And next time the guy's in, I hope you confront him, man. 
[44:30]
 I will.  Completely confront him.  All right.  All right.  All right, let's try to move on to other things.  Bob, oh, Bob hung up.  No big deal.  All right, we'll be back.  Dudes with dudes.  I think every time we open our mouths, we're pissing someone off.  Oh, come on, man.  We're out of control.  We're so wacky.  All right, man.  We're out of control.  We're so wacky.  We're so wacky.  We're out of control.  We're so wacky.  All right, knock it off.  1027 WNEW.  Hey, Anthony, Pizano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy. 
[45:00]
 Ah, Joey's Place, Pizano of Mulberry Street.  We go down there all the time, love the food, love the atmosphere.  The portions of Pizano's huge and very reasonable prices.  They got a pasta lunch special, so you can go down there for lunch.  And for dinner, it's great.  You take your family, you take a date.  You'll have a great time, great food, great atmosphere.  We love it.  If Joey's listening, I finally finished the food.  What would you have?  I brought all the food home that we had here for the rocks visit. 
[45:30]
 And after the crock walked out on us, no one felt like eating the fine food from Pizano  because we're all sick to our stomach.  So I brought it all home.  I had the penne ala vacca.  I had the chicken marsala.  Eggplant parmesan, Anthony.  All excellent dishes.  Get the stuffed veal.  Stuffed veal's good.  Fried ravioli.  We love the fried ravioli.  Oh, it's the best.  Also, just ask for Joey, the owner, when you're down there, tell him Opie and Anthony sent  you and he'll bring over a glass of wine on the house, Anthony. 
[46:00]
 Nice.  Very cool.  Pizano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  Give them a call, 965-1188.  That's 965-1188.  1027-WNEW, it's Opie and Anthony.  We have Julie on line 10.  She's very upset with us.  Julie, what is the problem today?  I'm really pissed off with what this guy just said today.  Regarding black people, I challenge him any day, his friend, to walk out for a week in  a black person's outfit or something, to be prejudged. 
[46:30]
 And I can understand how someone could get pissed off and tired of hearing black jokes  or anything pertaining to their race.  Some black people may not be offended, fine, but there are some that can't handle it, that  don't like it.  So Julie, are blacks the only group we should not pick on because you guys are so sensitive?  Excuse me?  Should we just lay off black people because you guys are so sensitive?  I don't think we should lay off anything, but you should understand that some people 
[47:00]
 have different levels of sensitivity regarding those types of subjects, whether it be black,  white, purple, green.  Huh?  You know?  Right?  You weren't listening.  I'm sorry, I was trading.  Jesus.  And it's not that black people are just complaining, you know, but some people can't handle it.  If it was interesting to me, I'd listen.  I'm sorry.  It's racism, Anthony.  We've had a little too much of that.  Can't we all just get along?  That's what I'm trying to say.  You know, you're like, why? 
[47:30]
 How dare you?  No, I was, I'm sorry, I was listening to what she's saying.  Look, she's saying that how could somebody say, you know, this is a racist thing.  They'd like to walk around in their skin for a while and then come up with some kind of  And then you tell me how it is that a black person or Hispanic person is complaining.  You don't know what it is to walk into a store and automatically prejudge as being someone  that's going to shoplift and all, whatever it is.  Get out my grill, right?  Huh?  I just say get out my grill. 
[48:00]
 You know, and I mean, yes, I mean, I'm not going to be a racist.  I say get out my grill.  You know, and I mean, yes, some black people say black jokes and it's great.  Some black people may hear it and can't be bothered with it.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  How did you guys become the most sensitive race though?  I really need to know that.  We're not the most sensitive race and I could be white for you know, just saying that.  All right, fine, then I'll.  Why are you assuming that I'm black?  Come on.  Why, yeah.  Don't even play that game with me. 
[48:30]
 Why are you assuming that I'm black?  Listen to you.  Why did you automatically assume that I'm black?  Because of the way you talk.  You sound like a black person talking.  You're prejudging and you're assuming that I'm black.  Shut up.  Who are you?  Are you black?  Are you black?  Are you black?  Are you black?  Are you black?  Are you black?  No, I'm not.  What are you?  I'm not black.  I'm an Hispanic woman.  But you're black.  I'm a black.  You're black Hispanic.  What you prejudging?  Black Hispanic whatever.  You're black Hispanic, right?  Oh, black. 
[49:00]
 You're black Hispanic.  You're black Hispanic.  You're black Hispanic.  You're black Hispanic.  You're black Hispanic.  You're black Hispanic.  You're black Hispanic.  You're black Hispanic.  You're black Hispanic.  You're black Hispanic.  You're black Hispanic.  You're black Hispanic.  You're black Hispanic.  You're black Hispanic.  You're black Hispanic.  You're black Hispanic.  You're black Hispanic.  You're black Hispanic.  You're black Hispanic.  You're black Hispanic.  You're black Hispanic.  You're black Hispanic.  You're black Hispanic.  You're black Hispanic.  You're black Hispanic.  You're black Hispanic.  You're black Hispanic.  You're black Hispanic.  You're black Hispanic.  You're not black. 
[49:30]
 You're black.  First of all, you're a hypocrite, because you started this conversation saying, you  know, I would like to see this guy walk around the streets in black skin for a week to see  how it is to be black.  So how do you know how it is to be black?  You don't have a clue.  This is a white person already having ratio what another race is like.  Including you.  Including me, you're right, including me.  You want three judges!  You don't know the oppression of being a privileged white person.  person.  Julie, you really want to get into this?  You're prejudging, you know, and assuming what black people feel. 
[50:00]
 You don't know how black people feel if you're Hispanic, you idiot!  I'm not an idiot, okay?  I'm not prejudging.  I'm just saying that how could everyone walk by saying this particular race is the most  sensitive race when you don't know what it is to walk in their shoes?  You don't know how it is to walk in black people's shoes either, now do you?  I'm a minority in this country and I know it is to be prejudged, that's what I'm trying  to tell you.  You're not a minority in this city. 
[50:30]
 I'll tell you who's a minority in this city.  Me, Opie.  I live in a city, I'm living on Long Island.  I live in Long Island, how do you know I'm living in a city?  That's a crock of crap.  I'll tell you who the minority in this city is, it's whitey, man.  Have you been on the subway lately?  Excuse me?  I look around every morning, I'm the only white guy.  Well, then okay, fine, but then you still, you do not get the same, you're not prejudged  the same. 
[51:00]
 I don't care where you go, it's not the same.  The point is, you're in this country and it's not the same.  How do you know that?  You're making absolutely no sense and I'll tell you why if you shut your big crap.  You are ruining what I've been saying.  Shut up!  Shut up!  You are a prick.  Shut up!  Shut up!  You could be rude if you like, but you're prejudging.  Shut up!  You really are.  So are you.  So are you.  As soon as I put on the phone, you assumed that I was black because of the way I stand.  This whole... 
[51:30]
 You're kind of in the city, you know what I mean?  The whole thing is prejudging.  Now I...  Now I...  Your radio show and you have more of a say than I...  Now that I don't really need to defend myself because I really could care less what people  think of me, but I'll tell you the reason why I thought Julie was black, Anthony.  Why?  It wasn't because of her voice.  It was because of the beginning of her conversation where she stood up for the black guy and said,  how dare anyone, you know, make those...  Prejudge.  Prejudge a black person.  They have...  And see, I can't even concentrate. 
[52:00]
 Listen to this bitch.  Can you imagine going home to this lady every night?  No, but we go friend-hatshack before.  Say it.  Listen to this.  Yeah?  I'm listening.  The deal is you called up to defend the black person.  I'm not defending the black person.  And you did it in a way saying, how dare this guy talk blah blah.  He has no idea how it is to, you know, walk around the city as a black person.  That's when I, Opie, assumed that you, Julie, were black.  Had nothing to do with your stupid voice, which is an...  And let me tell you something. 
[52:30]
 You said listen to how I...  Yeah, let me...  Okay, if you...  I said listen to how you talk, meaning what you said in your stupid conversation, you  idiot.  You're the idiot.  Come on, you're the idiot.  Now let me get on my side, Anne.  You said listen to how I talk, meaning what you said in your stupid conversation, you  idiot.  Come on, you're the idiot.  Now let me get on my side, Anne.  You said it.  You said it.  You said based on how I sound.  Hey, Julie.  Yeah, Julie, that was me.  Look at it.  Based on how I sound, you figured I was black.  Julie.  Based...  Julie.  Based how you sound.  Thank you.  I'm still in the right. 
[53:00]
 Julie.  Based how you sound, what you were saying.  This is pandemonium because I try to get a word in.  What?  This white person can't sound like me?  Can you... can you... can you let me talk for a second?  Please?  I'm listening.  Okay, here we go.  It was the content of your conversation, not your dialect.  That's what Opie's saying.  But what I'm saying is the way you sound when you talk sounds like a lot of black people  that I listen to and hear.  You have a certain sound to your voice.  Black people, when they talk, not all of them.  Don't lump it in and say that I'm saying all black people.  I'm saying that a lot of black people sound like you do on the phone. 
[53:30]
 Okay.  I understand where you're coming from now and I do.  Are you going to deny that?  I'm clarifying it.  But originally, that's not what was said.  You sound like a black woman talking on the phone.  Excuse me?  You sound like a black woman calling up this show.  That's what your voice sounds like to me.  Oh, you were wrong, okay?  All right.  If you see me, you'll notice, if I don't tell you that I'm Hispanic, you would never know.  What would I think?  You would think I was white because many people do, okay? 
[54:00]
 Well, what are you doing talking?  What are you doing?  Again, according to you, as soon as I open my mouth, you would know I'm white.  Well, what are you doing talking like that?  What are you doing talking like that?  What do you mean what I'm doing talking?  What do you mean what I'm doing talking like that?  You got like a black twang to your voice.  Well, what if I'm a white person from the south or something?  What are you talking about?  No, it sounds like inner city black accent.  And guess what?  I'm being raised in the inner city.  Well, then how come you sound like that? 
[54:30]
 Because that's just the way I talk.  I'm sorry I don't sound lily white like you.  Lily white?  Well, that's a little racist comment you're making there.  Yeah, well, you want to talk about racist comments?  You're trying to say no white person sounds like me?  I am.  I see them on the Jerry Springer show all the time.  They come out, they're called wiggers.  Do you mean they separate the good from the bad?  No, they're called wiggers.  They come out and they're white and they start going, yeah, well, I be hanging in my crib.  You know, they're jibby and we're hanging.  And it's ridiculous.  It looks ridiculous.  You don't know their educational level, but you're talking about how they sound. 
[55:00]
 Educational level.  You could just say education level.  Oh my God.  But Julie, you don't sound very educated.  You're talking about Jerry Springer.  Julie, you don't sound very educated.  I'm telling you, you don't sound very educated.  Julie, can you take your lips off of auto flap?  I can't hear what you're saying.  Too bad.  Oh boy.  Auto flap.  Yeah, you don't listen.  Is that OB?  Yeah.  You know, the other guy sounds like he has more fist in you.  He really does.  Don't get that impression.  He does.  Because you know what? 
[55:30]
 I respect him.  He clarified what he said.  I clarified what I said.  You just didn't want to listen.  You have an issue.  You really do.  You need to look into yourself.  And you know what?  Besides that, I do listen to you.  I think whether you think I'm educated or not, because I don't care what you say.  You know, I really don't.  I don't care what you think because I know what I am.  But the other guy has more sense, obviously.  That's obvious.  I love Julie thinking I have more sense.  No, no, no.  You do.  Because you said something, you clarified it, and you're beating me with your facts. 
[56:00]
 Where's the other one?  He's trying to go.  It's ridiculous.  What?  I said it's ridiculous.  There we go.  You know?  How do you spell ridiculous?  How do you spell ridiculous?  Ridiculous.  Hello?  Oh, she got off the track.  Dude, I can't record.  Julie?  She got off the track.  How'd she hung up?  God damn it.  Like when you want a train to hit somebody, they come off the track.  I'm exhausted. 
[56:30]
 Oh my God.  Wasn't she trying to talk about the black experience?  She was talking about the black experience, and how do you know what the black experience  is all about?  That's what I assumed when I was talking to a black lady.  It turns out she's a Hispanic.  But I assumed it's entirely on the sound of her voice, Alpie.  And now she's a hypocrite because now she's trying to tell everyone what the black experience  is even though she has no freaking clue what the black experience is because she's Hispanic.  Anybody that wants to tell me that there isn't a distinct African American sound to a voice, 
[57:00]
 you could call it what you want.  Call me a racist.  Call me I'm stereotyping.  I'm bigoted.  Whatever you want.  You're going to tell me that there isn't a distinct sound to a majority of African Americans  in the sound of the voice?  I'm glad you added that word because our buddy Chuck who calls the show a lot, he sounds 
[57:30]
 as white as they come.  And our own black Earl sounds as white as they come.  I'm not saying all blacks will sound like that.  But when you get a phone call and a girl sounds like she did, you do assume that it's a black  person.  Keith?  Yo.  What's up?  Hey, call the reporter.  I just heard something that was staged.  What's your girlfriend, Alpie?  Your girlfriend.  See you guys later.  Very good, Keith.  Call the reporter.  What an idiot.  Very good.  Everyone has a comment now.  We'll take a couple and then we've got to take a break.  Joe, what's up?  How are you doing, Alpie?  Anthony.  I'm just saying it's just the way people perceive things. 
[58:00]
 You know?  Like how people talk.  The way they talk and all is like I understand what you're saying there.  Sorry, I'm sounding a little bit nervous here.  That's alright.  And, you know, I'm not saying that you're not going to be able to hear me.  That's alright.  And, are you an Asian man?  No.  I'm not Asian.  I'm actually a mix.  I'm Irish and Ecuadorian.  Wow.  Irish and Ecuadorian.  Wow, that's pretty cool.  Your dad must have been really drunk. 
[58:30]
 I got a vocation skin, so.  Yeah, that's cool.  Like I'm perceiving the way you are.  That's right.  Right on, man.  So I just wanted to let you know it's just the way people perceive things.  You know?  I'm not an Asian.  I'm not an Asian.  I'm not an Asian.  I'm not an Asian.  I'm not an Asian.  I'm not an Asian.  I'm not an Asian.  I'm not an Asian.  But I just want people to perceive things and it sucks how they actually show them.  By the way, I apologize for stereotyping.  I mean, how do we know if your dad is the drunk and it wasn't your mom?  Don't worry about it. 
[59:00]
 Who is the Irish drunk?  It's like I'm mute, sir.  I got my friends.  My Italian friends always bug on me.  Alright man.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Bye.  Walter.  Yes?  What's up?  Hey, I'm Walter Yatling.  Hey, how are you doing?  I saw you guys at the Mexican Hotel.  That was a really cool show.  I want to agree with you guys.  want to agree with you guys i think everybody has a distinct uh...  uh... sound i think you're too bad people to go for a black or a tonic  women are tired of work  i think for now i think we have to do you guess your race and you call the show  i'm gonna i'm guessing 
[59:30]
 i'm gonna guess porto rican anthony  okay walter way walter speak a little bit let anthony get a chance at okay  sure uh... the one with a few days to go couple pictures you guys are  orders  i should be downloading them from now support rican yeah well and i i'll wait  area  recruit coast  replied to  we don't like to see the we have is going to switch to dominican  on dot  cuba here with the records of u  but if you would what did they find out 
[60:00]
 or Miami.  obviously it's part of the  for us  techno  back- Matak certainly  up to h九  over the break  and  the mouse now I call it the machine gun syndrome.  How they flap.  How they flap and flap and they don't stop.  You wonder how they catch their breath between sentences because they're talking so fast.  But that's a Spanish thing though.  Whenever we speak Spanish, it's tick-a-tick-a-tick-a-tick-a-tick-a-tick-a-tick-a-tick-a-tick. 
[60:30]
 When you guys need to know, you're like, you know, Spanish is a very fast language but  English isn't that fast, so slow it down a little bit.  Right, exactly.  Slow it down.  Slow it down.  Slow it down.  But you know what I noticed too?  Like for example, you know, I'm Cuban, I was born here, but there was like, for example,  a point I was working around Mexicans and after a while I was speaking like the way  they were and people were thinking I was Mexican.  So sometimes it happens that the people that you're around might influence the way you 
[61:00]
 speak even though you might not be of that background.  I don't know if you've ever seen that or experienced that but I found that to be pretty interesting,  you know?  But I don't know what else to say to you guys but I'm just overwhelmed.  Spats had me on the phone for an hour last week.  I never got through to you guys.  Oh, there you go.  But I'm so glad I got to meet you guys.  Hey, it's the first time on the show.  I don't know what else to say to you guys but thanks so much.  Hi, Walter.  Letting me bend my opinion and everything.  All right, Walter.  Remember the phone?  The only two whites.  Start the train.  I'm sorry. 
[61:30]
 No, no, no.  I don't want no train.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Mike, what's going on?  Yeah, what's going on, fellas?  All right.  I'm working in Harlem, the South Bronx for a phone company all day long.  Let me tell you something.  These people are nuts.  They're throwing things out the window.  They're going crazy.  They see me.  They think I'm a cop.  They run away.  Then they come up, you know, hey, what are you doing?  I'm working.  You know, what am I, a cop with a phone hanging off my belt?  Right.  What are you talking about?  This black experience thing.  If anybody, if any black guy talked like a white guy in Harlem, he'd be beaten by his 
[62:00]
 friends until he was like, yo, what's up, man?  Well, that's where we get it all from.  I mean, everybody does have their distinct voice and their distinct way of speaking.  Of course.  It's just reality.  It has nothing to do with racism or anything.  It doesn't.  It's not a racial thing.  It's where you come from.  I'm sure a black guy from Texas won't sound like a black guy from Harlem.  Yeah.  You know?  When they have the comedians from, live from the Apollo Theater and they make fun of Whitey,  it's all well and good, right?  Yeah, that's okay.  But if I sat here and saw the black joke in Harlem, I'd be reading about parts of my body 
[62:30]
 on the highway the next day in a paper.  There you go.  Hold on.  There's a guy that disagrees with you.  Jimmy, you're on with Mike.  What's up?  Hey, Mike, I disagree with you.  I work with wiggers.  I work with specks.  I work with Jews.  I work with all of them.  I'm still Italian and I talk Italian and that's all I got to say about it.  You know what?  You got no point because you're a dumb, greasy wop.  I'm sick of my dumb, greasy wop right in your face.  Why?  Okay, go back and watch Goodfellas for another three hours, you stupid asshole. 
[63:00]
 Where are you from?  Oh, me.  I can't call you from the front.  Me.  Give me a favor.  Let me get a large pie.  How's that sound?  You're right there.  Oh, wait a minute.  Yeah, let me get mushrooms on that.  Did you grow up with that one?  I grew up banging your mother.  How was she?  Was she good?  No, she sucked.  Yeah, I was too busy shaving your mother's back, that greasy Italian whop.  Really?  Where are you from, you mutt?  Where am I from?  Yeah, motherfucker, where you from?  You're right back.  Come here.  Come here.  Give me a favor. 
[63:30]
 I'll call up the police.  You can come by and kick my ass.  Yeah, I'll come by and kick your father's ass because he made you.  Yeah, really?  Yeah, but you know what?  He's not a greasy whop with a stinking fat hairy wife like your mother and father.  Very good, you freaking...  You're a little sympathy for the boys going there?  You feel sympathy for the boys going there?  You stupid Italian pig.  How come your women turn like fat and 400 pounds and half when they turn 25?  What's wrong with that?  They want to be killed.  What's going on there? 
[64:00]
 You might as well have these Italian boys born with a razor because they've got to start  shaving the same time I do.  Good for you, stupid wetback.  I'm a wetback?  Now I'm a wetback?  What, do you just want to pick any race out of the book and throw it on me?  Listen, I didn't you say you were killed?  I want a hot pie with extra cheese and two sodas.  You don't bring it to my house.  That was the other caller, dude.  I'll send it to your mother's house.  Oh yeah, my mother likes that.  All right.  Good.  Holy smoke, man.  Nothing but a little race of love here today. 
[64:30]
 What are you going to do?  You know, we've got to get along.  Can't we all get along?  There you go.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Bye.  Be good, On.  Thanks, Mike.  Holy smoke.  Mike, relentless.  Mike smoked Jimmy.  Wow, I've got to say that.  Pretty funny.  And then laughing at all the Italian jabbing.  Hey, funny's funny.  And he's right.  Hey, Ann, your mom did say I was hot.  Oh, come on, Mom. 
[65:00]
 1027 WNEW, it's the Open Anthony Show.  We're trying to do a show, but we've got to try to get Anthony off E-Trade and we'll be  able to move on to the festivities today.  1027.  How many shares have you moved around today? 
[65:30]
 Oh my God, really?  You've moved around a couple thousand shares today.  Absolutely.  I'm stirring the show.  That's got to be a radio first, too.  Come on.  We're in the middle of this heated argument.  I look at Ann for some moral support and I'm like, oh my God, I don't think he's paying  attention.  He's not even listening to me.  She's babbling, I've got to scoop up AOL.  Well, everyone's talking about the Time Warner AOL merge. 
[66:00]
 Yeah, pretty big.  Absolutely unbelievable.  And then AOL kind of took a little dip today.  Went down like almost nine points today.  Yeah.  Do we have our closing stats for today, Ann?  I think we do.  Let's go to the Tote board.  I know NASDAQ took a hit today.  Yeah, a little down.  AOL, no, made a little bit of a comeback.  7 and 15, 16 sits down today.  64 and 11, 16 is open. 
[66:30]
 So you've made some money there.  I'm in.  You made some money in the last 20 minutes there.  Very good, Anthony.  Congratulations.  Bravo.  Thank you.  Believe me, I need it.  And what did the Dow do today?  NASDAQ was down what, 168, something like that today?  Yeah, 120, I think.  120?  Something like that.  I've got to go back to the other page.  Can't be bothered.  All right.  But yeah.  So your trading is done for the day?  Well, the market is closed, but I do have after hours trading here on E-Trade. 
[67:00]
 What a dangerous thing the E-Trade is.  It's like crap.  It's bad.  And I've had it for a couple of years now.  It's efficient.  It's fun.  You might as well.  Like everyone's trading now.  Yeah.  Everyone's into stocks.  Remember our old boss here, Opie?  We had a boss here.  I'm not mentioning any names.  I'm not saying anything, but it was always about the stock ticker. 
[67:30]
 Yeah.  Instead of having meetings in the office, the ticker would be on and, you know, he's  like a crack dealer.  He kind of got me all involved.  Yeah, he's pretty much passed his Fed habits on to us as far as the stock market.  A lot of people, Opie, not with the E-Trade account, but on the phone with his broker  every so often.  Got a hot tip the other day.  You went up a couple of points with that stock, didn't you?  Yes, I did.  Look at you.  I jumped in a little penny stock action.  It could only mean the end of the stock market when the likes of Opie and Anthony are trading. 
[68:00]
 When we are trading, it can only mean it is doomed.  If you guys only know, man, what we're about, we're a bunch of slobs.  Now we've got a broker and an E-Trade account.  Oh, it's a mess.  It's not because we're making a lot of money here.  We've been sucked in like everyone else.  Yeah.  You know?  When we put down the porn to take a call from a broker, you know there's a problem.  Yeah, that's true. 
[68:30]
 Like he muted the porn because he's on the phone with his broker.  Didn't turn it off, believe me.  I just muted.  What?  What are you recommending?  He has some interesting news for me.  Yeah.  I'm trying to expand my portfolio.  Portfolio?  My portfolio.  Are you training me?  I need to be for my portfolio.  My broker looked at my portfolio and said, there's some serious problems here. 
[69:00]
 What?  Because everything is like I'm going for the big win, the big hit.  Opie, you need to diversify.  I believe is the word you're looking for.  Diversification in your stock.  You're like pretty heavily into the tech stocks as I see it.  Am I going to diversify?  Yeah, if there's a disaster, you're F'd.  Yeah, everything's going down the crap.  If the tech sector takes a dump, Opie's broke.  So he gave me all this advice.  I was on the phone for like 10 minutes.  He was telling me why I have to diversify and stuff. 
[69:30]
 Pharmaceuticals, Opie.  And I'm like, Opie's into drugs, man.  Opie bought into drugs.  Biotech, Ant.  You're amazing.  Biotech.  You bought drugs.  He's a drug dealer.  Hey, man.  He's a legal drug dealer.  You got to do your research.  There may be a cure for cancer soon.  Oh, could be huge.  That's all I'm going to say.  Well, that's all you better say.  That's all I'm going to say.  Amazing.  So the broker's giving me all this info on how I should diversify stuff.  And I'm like, hey, man, I'm young. 
[70:00]
 Put it on black and let it ride.  There you go.  That's it.  You got to play the market like you're in AC.  Hell yeah.  Like you're in Atlantic City, man.  Spin the wheel.  Come on.  What am I saving for?  Put it on black and let it ride.  All right.  Come on.  I'm splitting.  Right.  I got an 11.  Double down.  Double down.  That's it, man.  Yeah, I got to check my numbers in a minute here. 
[70:30]
 Oh, I'll check my numbers.  I won't tell you what stocks I have, but I have to check my after hours trading.  I'm not done yet.  Are you serious?  I'm not trading.  You had a pretty serious day.  I'm done.  Nice.  It's so funny that everyone gives you stock tips.  It's hilarious.  Oh, man, it looks like everyone else is checking their numbers.  I can't get it.  That's all right.  Yeah.  What a person.  I think E-Trade should pay for that commercial we just did because now we can't get on their 
[71:00]
 website.  Damn.  All right.  And let's try to move on to other things here today.  We'll take a whack at it.  I'm in shock.  What?  The biggest news story of the day?  Screw the Time Warner AOL merger.  That little thing.  Who cares?  There's other things to talk about.  Yeah.  Donald Trump breaking up with a supermodel.  Is he on crack? 
[71:30]
 We've all seen the pictures in the paper.  How do you dump that?  How do you dump that?  I'll tell you exactly what happened.  Tell me he got tired of that.  No.  Is it just like you and I where you just get tired of the same old game?  Oh, my God.  Oh, we're going to make believe that's not going on in people's heads right now?  Oh, my God.  What are you talking about?  Want to take a stock tip?  Is this R, Dave?  What happened to R, Dave? 
[72:00]
 What happened to stockbroker Dave?  What happened to stockbroker Dave?  This is not stockbroker Dave.  All right, Dave, what's up?  My father's a broker and I have a great stock to suggest.  If you want to check its yearly chart, it's gone up exponentially.  Well, we don't...  I don't know what the rules are here.  I don't know if I have a lot to say over here.  I don't either.  Yeah, we better...  I know those stock shows, they have those disclaimers about anything you hear on the  show.  I don't know if I have a lot to say over here.  I don't either.  I don't know if I have a lot to say over here.  I don't either.  I don't know if I have a lot to say over here. 
[72:30]
 I don't know if I have a lot to say over here.  I don't know if I have a lot to say over here.  I don't know if I have a lot to say over here.  I don't know if I have a lot to say over here.  I don't know if I have a lot to say over here.  I don't know if I have a lot to say over here.  I don't know if I have a lot to say over here.  I don't know if I have a lot to say over here.  I don't know if I have a lot to say over here.  Let's see.  You know how that is.  I own three stocks.  All we need is the commission on our stock.  I can say this, right?  I own three stocks.  You can say three, yes.  First one went up two and five-eighths today.  Very nice.  Second one.  I've been on a roll lately. 
[73:00]
 Down three quarters?  You're not a player.  Not a player?  That's why you're...  No, see, this is why I have to diversify.  Psycho Mark is looking like, oh, stocks.  He's not a player.  Psycho Mark, you'll get into the stocks eventually.  I guarantee it's not a snore fest.  Just about everyone is trading.  Dividend check.  Take us out to dinner.  Dividend?  Dividend.  You don't hold them long enough to get a dividend check, man.  What are you, crazy?  You've got to move them.  Shake them around a bit.  You've got to trade on the tick, my brother. 
[73:30]
 Throw out the old.  Come on, bring in the new one.  Speaking of stocks, what about whatever?  We're never having a stock market...  A stockbroker Dave.  A stockbroker Dave.  I don't know.  We disappeared.  He disappeared off the planet?  He's listening.  We'd love to hear from him.  He should broadcast live from the stock market something.  We were on the floor.  Maybe because he was such good friends with our old boss, he wants to sever any ties with  us.  Oh my God.  If there was one guy that could not stand our old boss, it was stockbroker Dave, man.  There was an alleged incident of him being stuck with a check one evening after being 
[74:00]
 invited out.  So he kind of felt bad, you know?  We're not allowed to talk about tips on the air.  That's coming down.  That's fine.  I don't care.  I didn't say anything, did I, before?  Now I'm getting paranoid.  No.  Oh, okay.  Sell, sell!  Mortimer!  No, you don't know what it's about, man.  Day trading, you know, selling on the 16.  Oh, come on.  Like I make enough money to even...  And before you know it, you're so insane.  You grab high-powered rifles and you go into these places and just shoot everybody up. 
[74:30]
 Into office parks.  Yeah, into office parks.  Remember that guy?  Mark.  He was a day trader and he lost like a hundred grand in like a day.  And he went into the place that he was working at and just started shooting him up.  Mark, here, sell this, you ass!  You got to jump on the bandwagon.  College kids are doing this instead of studying.  I'm serious.  Yeah, you should stop buying those bags.  There was a story I read over the summer of high school kids, high school kids that aren't 
[75:00]
 old enough to trade, going to their friend that is old enough to trade to buy a stock  for them.  Right.  And they would think he's like a bookie.  Right.  For school.  Yo, man, I need some Amazon.  I got it, I'm hurting real bad.  All right, but we were talking about Trump, weren't we?  Yeah.  He dumped his supermodel girlfriend.  Someone has to explain the logic to this.  I will tell you exactly what happened.  To this one.  Obviously, he is making a serious run for the presidency. 
[75:30]
 No matter how silly we all think it is and the rest of this country thinks it is, he  is seriously going to make a run for the presidency.  She must have some frigging baggage that he's got to dump this leggy one there.  You see the picture in the daily news?  Yeah.  But she's sprawled out on the presidential seal.  Across the presidential seal.  Those legs could go around you twice.  Look at the size of them.  She must have a serious flaw somewhere in that body for him to dump her. 
[76:00]
 It's got to be that she, I don't know, gave a hummer to Saddam Hussein during the Gulf  War or something.  I don't know.  There's got to be some skeleton in her closet.  Yeah, but is the presidency worth giving up that?  That?  Well, when you look at what he's getting right now before he's president and then you  look at what Clinton gets as president, yeah, I don't know. 
[76:30]
 You might want to hold on to this one.  And Clinton is a little better looking than Trump.  So if Clinton is getting that fat pig Monica as president, can you imagine what Donald  Trump's going to be getting?  Well, oh my God.  God damn.  Bob, what's up?  Hey, how are you?  What's going on?  You got this Trump thing all wrong.  He was married to two of these women who took him to the cleaners twice already.  He finally smartened up.  Well, he doesn't have to marry her. 
[77:00]
 Yeah, but she's probably hunting around for a ring.  He said, oh, screw this.  She's not hunting for anything.  She's just there.  Yeah, I mean, so he's dumping her.  When was the last time you saw Trump with an ugly girl?  Every girl you see him with, she's always hot.  He's a cocky man because how is he ever going to be this cocky?  Come on.  Every picture you see of him in the papers, man, you can't die for.  He's got the cash.  That's what it is.  He'll find another one.  He's not getting any younger.  I mean, you got to like, you know. 
[77:30]
 That doesn't matter.  You got to cash in eventually and say, you know what, it's not getting any better than this.  I'm going to stick with this one for a while.  You got the cash.  You can get whatever you want.  I don't know.  Cash equals cash.  Exactly.  Remember that for what did we learn on the show today.  There you go.  All right, Bob.  Thank you.  You guys are great.  Bye.  Tim, you're next on the show.  What's up?  How are you guys doing?  All right.  From what I heard in the news, the reason he dumped this luscious piece of ass is actually  one of the reasons she posed on that presidential seal in the magazine. 
[78:00]
 They were just talking about it.  Apparently Donald has felt that as inappropriate.  And I think he also didn't want to talk about how he's a member of the mile high club with  this girl.  I think he wants to be respectable.  I'm saying he's never going to get a girl back.  That girl will come to Jesus Christ.  The deal is Donald Trump as president, that's a goof.  Wouldn't it be great if a first lady looks like that?  Are you kidding me?  Oh my God.  Imagine that.  Hell to the chief and his wife. 
[78:30]
 Just imagine what goes on in the Lincoln bedroom.  Nothing would get done for this country.  Yeah.  He's just, excuse me, I'm banging my girl here.  Right.  All our foreign interests would...  Well, that's a way to...  It might work in our favor though.  He invites over these foreign dignitaries and whatever he wants, he's like,  I'll let you see her naked.  They parade her into the rose garden.  She drops her clothes.  Whatever he wants, whatever.  And she has hot friends. 
[79:00]
 Yeah.  All of a sudden you see all the leaders of the world walking around with supermodels,  all happy.  They're all patting each other on the back and high fiving.  Before you know it, there's peace on earth.  Peace ass on earth.  He's got a plan.  For God's sake, I'm voting for him.  They're having those Middle East peace talks.  Where the hell are they doing that?  In the middle of Virginia or something?  Is that the truth?  No way down there, right?  Why here?  You know what would solve that whole thing? 
[79:30]
 They just get a bunch of broads.  Boo-hey!  Do it in a strip club.  They'll sign anything.  All kinds of foreign currency going into the G-strings before you know it.  They're all drunk pals.  What are we arguing about?  Mike, what's up?  Hey, you go up and down the city, you see the most horrible looking guys  with the most beautiful girls, and it's usually one or two things.  It's money or it's something big in the pants, 
[80:00]
 and it's never something big in the pants.  It's always just the money.  Well, Anne said it.  Cash equals cash.  Oh, man, you know, a ten is a two with eight million dollars, you know?  Yeah, there you go.  All right, thank you, man.  Take care, guys.  Bye.  I mean, when he walked out at the Belmont Stakes,  when I went there and saw him and this chick,  like live, he walked out onto the blue balcony thing  and everyone's just booing the Donald.  And then they're like, you know, cat calling, whistling at this chick. 
[80:30]
 She's gorgeous.  He has to be gay.  What?  Has to be gay.  I don't know about that.  Why would you like even care about the presidency if you got that?  He probably told her, lay low, I'll still hook you up and stuff.  I'll come over occasionally, bang you.  I'll hook you up in a place.  And then if I win the presidency, you know, you move right in.  Then I'm president and no one could do anything about it, you know?  But he's not going to be president.  I know, but then after he's not the president, 
[81:00]
 then he's like, I'm still banging her anyway.  I'm sick of the papers reporting this as this is a serious thing  that could possibly happen.  It's not going to happen.  Donald Trump for president.  Nah, it ain't going to happen.  Everyone knows that.  It's going to be George W. Bush.  President, just like my father.  Going to be president.  That's it.  He's the guy.  Georgie?  You think it's going to be Bradley?  No, Bradley's hurting the polls lately. 
[81:30]
 He's hurting in the chest, too, ain't he?  He had those chest pains.  Yeah, he had the chest pains and all of a sudden his ratings dropped.  See what happens?  People want a healthy prez.  Your heart's okay, right, Ann?  We don't want our ratings dropping.  Not quite.  Okay.  I stopped smoking.  Yeah, I saw that.  See?  I'm amazed.  What?  What?  Just amazed.  How are you?  How you could do that?  I've been smoking a lot, man. 
[82:00]
 Ann picks up these habits that are just really bad.  And then all of a sudden you quit like cold turkey.  It's no big deal.  You've got to do that.  The heroin was the hardest.  I'm kidding.  But no, it was harder this time than it was last time.  Last time I just stopped.  This time I had a little crisis at the Hooters place.  We saw that.  I was puffing there laughing at you.  I was like, okay.  Come on, it was festive. 
[82:30]
 We're partying and drawing.  I don't give a crap.  Smoke until you get a black lung.  I could care less.  As long as you can continue doing voices.  Why is a black lung bad?  Let's take a break.  And we'll be back.  A lot of phone calls coming in.  So we'll talk to you guys next.  Oh, be an Anthony.  Can we get these illiterates off the air, please?  Please, suck.  If I wasn't on it, I wouldn't listen.  1027 WNEW. 
[83:00]
 It's the ONA show.  Hey, it's your show.  We encourage you guys to call and help us out.  That means we don't have to work as hard.  We get our best stuff from you guys.  Keep it coming.  Phone line 212-757-1027.  Jeremy's on line 9.  Jeremy, what's up?  How's it going, guys?  I just wanted to thank you guys.  I'm getting my Tuesday Night Hummer tonight.  Are you really? 
[83:30]
 Hell yeah.  How do you know for sure?  Because I told her about the Hummer.  She doesn't hear the show yet, but I told her about the Hummer.  And she's game.  She's game to make you a member of the Tuesday Night Hummer club.  Yeah, but she said there's conditions.  I have to be driving while it goes on.  Nah, little roadhead.  Nothing wrong with that.  Little roadhead.  And she said she's deep-throating until she licks the tape.  Holy smoke.  Hell yeah.  I got it going on tonight.  All right, Jeremy.  Oh, boy.  Congratulations.  Thanks, man. 
[84:00]
 No, thank you.  All right, man.  Thank you very much.  We got to play another Tuesday Night Hummer song.  Where's the quickie?  Let me read the facts while you get that.  I think it's on the left side there.  Dear O&A, I'm not sure that anybody has ever complained about your Tuesday Night Hummer club, but here goes.  My girlfriend decided to give me a back rub last night.  Key to the story.  Back rub last night.  Last night.  After dinner with a bottle of wine.  Sounding good, right, Ant?  Yeah. 
[84:30]
 When she went for the foot rub, I had a pretty good idea of what was next.  It was pretty late, and she had a long car ride home.  When she started to leave, I asked why she had stopped and didn't finish the deed.  Her reply?  It's not Tuesday.  Oh, no.  You guys suck.  Oh, what a cop-out.  A lot of the ladies are holding out, Anthony, for Tuesday.  Yeah.  It's backfiring once again in your pal's faces. 
[85:00]
 I think she was using it as an excuse, Opie.  All right.  That's what I think.  P.S., are you going to do a Super Bowl party and giveaway...  Are you going to do a Super Bowl party and giveaway like last year?  I want another chance to win a big-screen TV.  I was runner-up last year.  Well, we...  We decide not to do what we did last year.  No.  Nothing against the party we went to, but we felt very out of place, Anthony. 
[85:30]
 Yeah, kind of weird.  Last year, they sent us to people's houses.  Like, that's me and Opie.  Opie and I.  Went to a house.  A guy won a big-screen TV and a Super Bowl party, sponsored by us,  plus us as guests at his party.  So we pull up to the house.  And trust me, that's no treat to have us.  Yeah.  Nice enough.  People and everything.  We go in, but just picture this.  Super Bowl Sunday.  Leave your house. 
[86:00]
 Walk to a house where you don't know anyone.  But there's a lot of cars and you know there's a real good party going on inside.  Knock on the door and go, hey, what's up?  And then walk in.  It's a little awkward.  And then try to get along with the people and stuff.  Yeah.  And there was a couple of people I could talk to and everything,  but I just felt...  I don't know.  We had a good time.  Yeah.  But see, I mean, no one could...  I guess one of the problems is that we were the big prize,  and a year ago, no one really cared.  Yeah. 
[86:30]
 So we showed up as the big prize, and I swear to God,  there had to be, what, 50, 60 people in this house?  Yeah.  40 of them easily had no freaking clue who we were and could care less.  And most of them were like, why are they here?  Which, you know, it's fine.  I mean, who the hell would we?  Right.  But which is silly enough.  Like, even now, who the hell cares?  Right.  But they were very nice to us.  Yeah.  They treated us well.  Although I left...  We left at halftime, didn't we?  Like third quarter, yeah.  Did we leave at third quarter? 
[87:00]
 Yeah.  I thought it was halftime.  All of a sudden, I ate some Swedish meatballs over there.  Right.  And oh my God, I was perculating.  I was driving, I swear, I was supposed to go out to my mom's house,  out east.  Yeah.  I stepped on the gas.  I was racing to get home.  I had to just go home.  My stomach hurt so bad.  Came out the same way they went in.  Swedish meatballs.  Like Benoit balls.  Like a tennis ball launcher. 
[87:30]
 It's terrible.  So I guess we're not going to be doing that this year.  No.  I think we're trying to like throw a huge Super Bowl bash.  Yeah.  I think that would be much more our style.  My family's having a party.  I want to party with my family.  Can we broadcast from your family's party?  Yeah, let's do that.  That could be a lot of fun.  We'll do that.  All right.  Now we'll see what happens.  We might throw something together.  Yeah, we're going to try to figure it out. 
[88:00]
 Like everything else on this show.  Never know.  We had some great ideas today in our little brainstorming session.  Yes, we did.  Upcoming things for the rest of the year that I think people will enjoy.  Yeah, we're starting to actually prep for our show.  Don't get carried away.  Slow down.  Slow down.  We're actually trying to start to put some thought into what we do.  Yeah.  A couple of minutes a day.  Yeah.  Trying to think things out a little bit maybe.  But I came up with a few things I think might be fun this year. 
[88:30]
 Yeah, we don't want to pop them yet.  No.  But the funny thing is we're having these brainstorming meetings once a week.  We want everyone to come to the table.  Don't you need a brain for brainstorming?  Well, yeah.  There's plenty of storm going on in there.  Not much brain.  And we told everyone that's involved in these meetings to come to the table with some ideas  that we could throw around.  Yeah.  And Spaz is hilarious.  He was so excited.  He found out that we were having this meeting a week ago and he couldn't wait to tell everyone 
[89:00]
 his idea.  He was so happy that he was in the meeting and he's got his little notebook out and everything.  He opened up his little notebook and he's taking little notes and everything.  And he had his idea written down.  Now everyone's throwing ideas left and right about what we want to do.  I hate to stop you.  There's a guy online, because we'll get right back to what you're saying.  Yeah.  That was at the Super Bowl party last year that we attended.  Oh, really?  John, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  You don't like my girlfriend, Swedish people? 
[89:30]
 Those things, man.  It was like I was a Gatling gun when I went home.  We had fun, but no one really cared.  You know what I mean?  Was it really that bad?  No, no.  No, I don't want you guys to be pissed at us.  You guys were completely fine, but it was like kind of awkward.  It was awkward for everyone because most of the people didn't even know who we were.  Well, they did know who you were.  There's a lot of people listening to your show.  How many times have you guys played the tape of Aunt and I just watching the Super Bowl? 
[90:00]
 About 50 times.  Everybody knew you guys were so famous.  They kept playing.  They put a camera in the corner.  I found this a little awkward because then I felt like I had to do stuff.  I knew they would show this tape a million times.  These people have a tape that's got to be two hours long and all it is is Aunt and I  sitting on the couch watching the Super Bowl with the rest of the people.  We talked about that girl, Jamie, who called up earlier. 
[90:30]
 Can we touch on that?  Which one was she again?  What?  She was the black chick that wasn't black.  The Hispanic one?  She had to be black.  By the way she talked, she had the accent.  She was black.  Right.  I live in Armonk, New York.  My name is Rob.  What?  I didn't get that part.  I don't either.  Is he tricking us in?  I don't know.  I hate when people trick you and then hang up before you hear what they said.  Right.  Like if you want to trick us you could stay on the line.  It's okay.  Was there a Baba Booey in there and we missed it? 
[91:00]
 I don't think so.  Okay.  Anyway, so we were doing the brainstorming where everyone had to come to the TV.  We were doing the brainstorming.  We were doing the brainstorming.  We were doing the brainstorming.  So we were doing the brainstorming where everyone had to come to the table with some ideas.  Like we said, Spaz was very excited.  He couldn't wait to tell everyone his idea.  He had a notebook and everything.  He was very excited to even be part of the meeting.  You know?  And we were all throwing around some ideas, having some laughs, talking about what we  want to do in the upcoming year on the Opien Anthony show. 
[91:30]
 And then we were pretty much done with it.  And we finally go, well Spaz, do you have any ideas?  This is after like an hour of like, oh my God, that's a great idea.  We can do this.  We're all freaking out.  Everything that was mentioned.  And Spaz goes, well, yeah, I got an idea.  And it's very exciting too because some of these ideas that we were putting forth for  the Opien Anthony show, huge things.  Yeah.  It's not just like these little things.  I mean big things because now it seems we have cautious optimism that we are being 
[92:00]
 backed by the new regime here in place at WNEW.  There will be some money behind the show and some sponsorships and we'll be able to go  out and do some fun stuff in the upcoming year.  I'll believe it if they get our CD out, which they'll work on as we speak.  Very good.  So Spaz, well, at the end of the meeting, it's like, oh, and Spaz, do you have an idea?  Yeah.  Thumbs through his little notebook.  Finds his little idea page. 
[92:30]
 Eight man Fight Club elimination.  Tournament.  Tournament.  Like what?  Yeah, we get like...  And I think he meant listeners.  Wait, get him in here.  Like, did he mean just us?  No, no.  He wanted, there's about eight people that are regulars on the show and he wanted an eight  man...  Look how mad he feels.  Come on, Spaz.  I didn't think it was a good idea, but it's the best one I had of all the ones I'd written  down. 
[93:00]
 I want some of the other ones.  Come on, right now.  It's in my little notebook.  Get your little notebook, man.  I got to hear the ones you rejected.  He's running down the hall.  Go see who's on the warm line.  It might be someone.  Eight man Fight Club elimination tournament.  So basically he wanted...  Hey, Wes, that's the brawl.  And he's singing this in front of the new bosses and we're like, shut up, shut up.  Fight Club doesn't exist.  Shut up.  Shut up.  It's not Fight Club.  Because everyone's like, the new guys are like, what's Fight Club about?  Nothing.  Bit.  No big deal. 
[93:30]
 A little bit.  It's something we staged, so Dave Hinckley writes about it.  Yeah.  We're actually kicking each other's asses here in the studio.  Ass.  Hinckley.  So basically, yeah, he wanted a tournament set up to see who's the strongest guy in the  show.  All right.  Here's a little daily show, daily planner from the daily show.  Okay, Wes.  I figured this would help me get a little bit more in sync with the show.  There you go.  Very good.  So these are the ideas that you were too scared to mention. 
[94:00]
 Yeah, because I didn't think they were that good, as good as the Fight Club tournament  one.  You're really proud of the eight-man elimination Fight Club tournament.  Yeah.  Well, for now, yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Other ideas had was the Opie and Anthony dating game.  All right.  You joke.  Well, can you explain the Opie and Anthony dating game?  How does it work?  I was thinking about this on a train ride in.  I don't know.  I was thinking about instead of having the standard of asking questions, we just have 
[94:30]
 a really hot girl here and have three guys just do something like, I don't know, like  they do something crazy and they're training me.  All right.  He acknowledges the train.  We got to stop the train.  Okay.  Yeah.  Just have something, just think I'm crazy.  We had a brainstorm about it, but that just came up with the basic idea for the dating  game.  That hasn't been done on the radio before.  Okay.  The remake of the Tom Likus opener. 
[95:00]
 Likus, I don't think it's going to be working here much longer.  Yeah.  Okay.  That's stupid.  What else?  My next stupid one is boob weightlifting.  Boob weightlifting.  Boob weightlifting.  Yeah.  Just tie little harnesses to their boobs and just have them lift.  Well, we did the penis weightlifting.  So I figured it would include women in this and boob.  I don't think ladies boobs are as strong as a guy's junk.  Come on.  Oh, he's getting a little angry.  Turning down his idea. 
[95:30]
 Come on.  Boob weightlifting.  Yeah.  Okay.  And who is the gayest person on the Open Anthony show?  That's been done on another radio show.  Okay.  Lesbian Guest the Gash.  Why?  What's Lesbian Guest the Gash?  Okay.  I was thinking about lining five women up here and have a six one on the side to taste.  All right.  Be careful.  Hold on.  But one of those five would be a person that she knows so she could pick out the person 
[96:00]
 that she knows and she could taste.  I saw that on the HBO sex show.  Yeah.  Where they show all the sex shows from all over the world.  But pretty good idea.  Okay.  And there was another one done like that.  Another show.  I saw.  Another show.  Yeah.  Had a similar idea.  Okay.  Yeah.  It's kind of hard to come up with original ideas and stuff.  We understand.  And one more to fine tune if we do a Valentine's Day show.  Yeah.  Just to fine tune last year's. 
[96:30]
 Not that it needed fine tuning.  But what would a loser do for a date?  And to qualify you have to have a pathetic story and do something crazy and stupid.  That is?  That is what we did last year.  That's exactly what we did.  Exactly.  But we got too drunk so we couldn't like.  Yeah.  We couldn't even do our own content.  We couldn't see it all the way through because we were too busy like flirting with chicks  and getting hammered.  Come on!  We were supposed to do that last year.  I know. 
[97:00]
 What time is it?  Oh it's seven.  The show's over.  Blah, well drunk.  Sorry Spaz.  Go ahead.  Those are my ideas.  Okay.  They're very good ones.  That's okay.  You're still in the show.  So that's okay.  You're still, you're working on them.  That's what counts.  One of these days you'll rattle one off out of that book and we'll go, huh, huh, that's  a great idea.  I hope so.  Okay.  The phone's need answering.  Yeah.  Wait, someone thinks one of your ideas is funny.  Hold on.  Chris?  Yo, what's up guys? 
[97:30]
 What's up?  How you doing man?  Alright.  Yo, dude, you gotta do that.  Which one?  The one with the boob weightlifting?  The boob weightlifting.  Oh man, if you guys do that, I swear to God I'll make the harnesses myself.  I remember, Chris.  It's not going to happen.  Girls can't lift stuff from their boobs like guys can lift stuff from their junk.  Yeah.  Alright, Chris.  Alright, yo.  You have a fan out there.  What?  I was going to ask you a question.  Yo, what do you think of that sculpture?  Do you still want the other one?  The what?  The sculpture, man.  Remember the club with the seal?  Oh yeah, send it in.  Send it in.  No, no, I already sent it in.  I said do you want the other one? 
[98:00]
 Send the other one in.  Oh my God.  You're talking about the other one.  Send it in.  Send it in.  Send it in.  Send it in.  Send it in.  Send it in.  Alright, man.  You're talking about something.  No one knows what you're talking about, Chris.  Remember I brought in the club with the seal?  We know.  Alright, now do you want the other one about the rusty trombone?  Do you still want that?  Send whatever you want in there, Chris.  Alright, whatever.  Alright, whatever.  Alright, whatever.  And you want to talk to your stepfather?  As long as he's not going to yell at me, I'm going to get it right up front. 
[98:30]
 If he starts yelling, you hang up on him.  Hey, Sal.  Yeah.  You're not going to start yelling at me, are you?  No yelling.  Oh, okay.  I'm going to get a good call.  I've instructed Opie, if you start yelling at me, he has to hang up on you.  Well, this is really directed at Opie, so I feel bad he doesn't have any place to go  for Super Bowl.  And since you're coming, why doesn't he and Sandy, why don't they come?  Oh, really?  I've been invited to one of Anthony's functions.  Wow, look at that.  Actually, I did a wedding.  I thought that was pretty good, huh? 
[99:00]
 Yeah, I've heard stories.  They're legendary, your Super Bowl party, Sal.  Oh, yeah.  We haven't had one in a while.  You're supposed to have like 40 people there and stuff?  Yeah, that's what they tell me.  All right.  Sal's footing the bill.  Well, I like that.  Sal, if we're not doing a live broadcast, I'm there.  Okay.  All right?  Yeah, sounds good to me.  You get directions from Anthony.  Yes, he gets directions from Anthony.  I'm just pulling up to Apollo here.  Uh-oh, tell the guys I said hi.  You want to come help me do the contract?  No, God, I remember that. 
[99:30]
 I used to work there and Sal used to have to negotiate the contract with my boss and stuff.  It was pretty awkward.  It's like, oh, geez, I got to like a quarter.  Tell the guys I said hi, though.  I will.  I'll tell them to turn on the radio so they're not going to listen to me anyway.  All right, Sal.  All right.  Tell my mommy I said hi.  I certainly will.  All right.  You're definitely coming.  I heard you on the air.  I taped it.  I'll be there. 
[100:00]
 Okay.  All right, Sal.  Bye, Sal.  Okay, bye.  Nice to know you guys are getting along these days.  Oh, yeah, we all made up.  Everything's fine now.  They understand.  Right.  And so do I.  Sort of.  Fernando?  Yeah, what's up?  What's up?  Yo, did you see Mankind when he did the Cactus Jack gun thing?  No.  You didn't see that after he hit Triple H with that top on the board?  Yeah. 
[100:30]
 He did the bang bang bang.  All right, cool.  Thanks.  Yeah, man.  Wrestling, I don't know much about wrestling.  So, yeah.  These people are out of your freaking minds, man.  Everyone's decided to come up with ideas for our radio show.  Jasper.  All right, we have to get them on the air.  Jasper.  How you doing?  All right.  Come on, that'd be a great show.  You get one of the hosts come in and see who has the shortest penis on the opening issue. 
[101:00]
 Hold on, hold on.  I'm sorry.  Very good, Jasper.  Hey, I got a quick joke.  Yeah?  Black guy and Spanish guy in the back seat of a car.  Who's driving?  Tom.  All right.  All right.  Oh, man.  We better take a break.  Yes.  Did we accomplish anything with that break yet?  Oh, plenty.  Yeah.  We'll have to wait until the end of the show to see what we learned.  That's when we truly know we got things accomplished today. 
[101:30]
 Yeah, we made an impact.  It makes me sleep better at night.  Just that segment, knowing that people are learning things from our show.  There you go.  All right.  Oh, and the Valium.  I want to talk about Sleep Sex.  Next.  Sleep Sex.  Yeah.  Great article in one of the men's magazines.  I'm not sure if it was Max or more details.  I'm sure they love that.  I know.  I'm sure people at Details love the fact that you can't distinguish them from Maxim. 
[102:00]
 Or vice versa.  Or vicey-versey.  Well, maybe because the editor-in-chief worked at both places.  So, yeah.  Confusing.  When is he going to come in here again?  I don't know.  We got to call him up.  Our buddy Mark from Details.  Mark Golan.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's take a break.  We'll be back.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Throwing that jumping all over each other.  Okay.  Terrific.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW. 
[102:30]
 This is Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  Hope you're enjoying the festivities today.  It's a root rig.  Gets were sold today.  It's official.  So.  I guess the NFL has to approve the deal, but the jets were sold to Johnson & Johnson.  Johnson.  Wood Johnson the fourth.  Wood Johnson.  Roberts.  Roberts.  Wood Johnson the fourth.  Is that a joke?  It's sort of the God. 
[103:00]
 Come on.  It's a joke.  Hair to the.  Hair.  I said hair.  Hair.  Hair to the Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Empire for nearly 635 million dollars.  Wood Johnson.  Pending league approval, Anthony.  I wonder how Dick Johnson feels about that.  Things slided.  And what about Harry?  Harry Johnson.  Did they even ask Harry before they gave it to Robert Wood?  I don't know.  And then poor little Pecker Johnson, the youngest of the Johnsons. 
[103:30]
 All right.  What does that?  What does it mean for the jets?  What does it mean?  Stability, Anthony, I believe.  A little stability for the club.  I guess it's better than having a dead guy run it.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's always good if your owner's living and breathing.  Wonder what this means for Parcells.  Oh, please.  Big raise.  He's coming back as coach.  Come on.  They'll offer him up some huge slice of cake-age.  Without a doubt.  And he'll be in.  He'll be in.  He'll look like the hero.  God damn, is he a genius.  He can't lose next year.  Even if the jets go 3 and 13, he can go, hey, I came back to try to help the team. 
[104:00]
 I wanted to retire.  You brought me back.  But I had to come back because there was no one else to do the job.  Now I'm leaving for good.  Really?  Now I'm leaving for CBS to do their play-by-play.  Yeah.  Their color commentary, as you will.  No, I think he's coming back.  Yeah, I would think so, too.  And then who was voted into the Hall of Fame today?  Fisk and who else?  Was it Perez? 
[104:30]
 Did Perez make it after all?  Pudge and Perez make up Class of 2000, Hall of Fame, Anthony?  Very excited.  You gotta give them a lot of credit.  Care?  Care?  I can't believe we're going to be taking the calls on Johnson & Johnson buying the jets.  How would this affect the Q-tip?  Taking the calls?  I use the Q-tips all the time now, Mikey.  Cleaning the ears out.  I use the Johnson & Johnson.  Now how is this going to fare?  Are they going to be turning green?  Is it going to be jets green?  How can I tell what color the wax is in my ears?  If they change the cotton on the cotton swabs to jet green? 
[105:00]
 Taking the calls now, Mikey.  That's right to look.  Alright.  Yeah, let them discuss what it means.  What it means, Harry.  What does it all mean?  What does it mean, Mikey?  The meaning of life.  I'll tell you what it means, Mad Dog.  It means that our ticket prices are going up once again.  They'll find some excuse to raise tickets once again this year.  I'm going to be there on a cotton ball day.  Johnson & Johnson buy the jets to throw our cotton balls to the crowd. 
[105:30]
 Or corn removers.  Johnson & Johnson corn removers.  That is detecting.  There you go.  I'm trying to see what else is going on in the news.  Angie Everhart was here.  Was she here?  Yes, Stallone's old squeeze.  Yeah?  Was she in Playboy or something?  What's the deal with that?  She's doing a spread in Playboy?  She did a spread on my bed a while ago.  That's a lie.  Better than Adrian.  I gotta tell you that much. 
[106:00]
 Did you crap on her?  I appreciate doing that kind of thing.  I usually crawl underneath a glass table and have crap on my face.  Crap on me, Mickey!  Mickey, crap on me!  If you don't know the story...  I was like a boxer and I met her and she was real ugly.  I started winning fights and she came up and got up and said,  Oh wait, I was Asian.  There were three X hookers from Hollywood that wrote a book. 
[106:30]
 They named names and stuff.  They named Sylvester Stallone and they swear it's true.  We cannot confirm on this radio show.  No, but it's in that book.  It's in that book.  I'll get the name.  I just don't have it on me now.  Sylvester Stallone liked crapping onto glass tables.  I like being under the table. 
[107:00]
 I'm sorry, I got the details wrong.  I'm sorry.  I was saying that so casually.  Can you imagine someone in their car like,  How could you just casually say that?  Sylvester Stallone was under the table.  I was under the table.  The glass table.  The broad would be on top and take a dump on my face.  Mickey!  On top of the glass table and he would pee under it.  Yeah.  According to this book from an X hooker in LA.  You ain't never seen nothing like it. 
[107:30]
 I'll tell you that.  Imagine that.  That's got to be some view.  That's why all my glass tables have windshield wipers on them.  Like the spray that comes out wipes it clean.  That's just beyond bizarre.  Mickey!  Mickey!  Come on me, Mickey!  So Angie Everhart was here.  Yeah.  She was on the Radio Check show.  I gotta say, she's not that hot.  No?  Ben, you saw her? 
[108:00]
 Hot?  Yeah, she's hot.  Oh, she's hot?  I don't know.  Yeah.  It's all right.  It's not ugly or anything.  I was expecting much better.  Really?  Yeah.  I didn't see her.  Any pics?  Everyone was in that studio behind you.  Where the Scooby Doo eyes come from behind the glass?  Yeah.  It's so funny.  It's pretty much like a room where people could go in and you can't tell if you're being stared at from that other room.  Yeah.  So everybody was piled in there taking a look at her. 
[108:30]
 Freaking people around here.  Wasn't that impressive?  No, huh?  Not really.  I gotta see a picture.  Mike Adams was drooling, really?  He was going crazy.  Well, I hear the spread is unbelievable.  That's Mike.  I hear the spread is unbelievable, but they can do miracles in there.  A little airbrushing and stuff.  All that stuff.  Little nip and tuck here with the old digital manipulator.  She's all right.  Here it is.  Sleep, sex, Anthony.  Sleep, sex.  It was details. 
[109:00]
 Fine magazine that we like to read.  Yes.  You think this is true?  What?  A few lucky men combine two of life's greatest pleasures, sex and sleep.  When a 41-year-old Silicon Valley executive woke up one morning, he was well into his wife.  And it wasn't his first such lewd awakening.  For 15 years, he's been a sleep sexer.  What sleep experts call men who get busy when they're asleep.  One time, my wife told me I placed myself in front of her face. 
[109:30]
 I phrased my request in a way I normally wouldn't, says Sam.  Says Sam, not his real name.  It struck me as being a little impolite.  Just a tad.  Probably, you know.  Suck my...  Sound improbable.  It's not even uncommon.  According to Dr. David Blah Blah, head of Blah Blah.  I hate when they do that in articles.  Dr. David Saul Rosenfeld, head of the Kaiser Permanent Sleep Clinic in LA.  Can't.  Right.  Whose recently published sleep sex study was prompted by a woman who noticed her rather 
[110:00]
 staid boyfriend was unusually kinky and aggressive during their early morning sleep.  Often biting and talking dirty, Anthony.  She loved it.  Yeah.  Until she noticed he was snoring and wasn't remembering a lick of it later.  A lick.  It's part of what Mark Mahowald, MD professor of neurology at the University of Blah Blah  Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah.  Dad!  Right.  Calls, uh, Confusional Arousal.  A state somewhere between confusional, confusional, confusional, confusional, confusional, confusional,  confusional, confusional, confusional, confusional, confusional, confusional, confusional, confusional, 
[110:30]
 Confusional.  Confusional.  Confusional.  Arousal.  A state somewhere between sleep and wakefulness.  I've never heard the word confusional.  C-O-N-F-U-S-I-O-N-A-L.  Confusional.  Has to be.  Uh, I guess only guys do this.  All right.  I'm trying to say.  It happens in males that are particularly common.  It's common in guys who are sleep deprived or have a history of sleepwalking. 
[111:00]
 Hmm.  My hubby does sleep sex.  Ah ha ha.  There you go.  Let's see.  Cheryl.  Hello.  Your husband does sleep sex.  Yes, he does.  Really?  And I like when he sleeps.  I tell him to go to sleep more often.  Why?  Is he just a completely different person?  Yeah.  Actually, um, when I first, when I first met him, I was really into him.  So one night I snuck over his house at like two o'clock in the morning.  I figured I'd surprise him, you know, and I walked him just a negligee on and stuff. 
[111:30]
 And we had sex and then the next day I was talking to him and he didn't even know we did it.  So I, he said I was sleeping through it.  So I figured he was probably drunk or something.  So then now we're married and we first, one night I just woke up and he was there.  He was on top of me and it was completely different.  He was talking dirty and he, and it, um, it was, it was like, we're often like a whole  different person.  And then, um, I was talking to him about the next day and he said, sure, I have, I have  no idea what you're talking about.  He said, I don't remember any of this.  Yeah. 
[112:00]
 And now all I gotta do is lean over and just touch him in a private part and he's there  in a second.  No kidding.  Jesus.  Okay.  Sleep sex every night if I want.  That's wild.  Does he ever go too far though and really get just over the top wild?  Um, and then he could use that as an excuse that, hey, I don't remember that.  It was sleep sex and now actually it's, it's, I mean, it's, it's more wild than normal  only because it's, um, it's a little bit more aggressive.  Right.  And he'll, and he'll even talk and he'll talk dirty and everything. 
[112:30]
 Right.  Um, but it's never gotten to the point where I've had to stop him, you know, and it's,  it's not really a long time either.  It's basically just until he gets to the, to when he's finished.  Right.  It's, it's, it's so good though that it doesn't matter to me, you know?  Right.  But, uh, yeah, it's, and I've been married to him for almost 10 years and if I wanted  to, I could do it every single night.  All right.  Well, I guess it's happening then.  Thank you, Sharon.  You're welcome.  All right.  Cause Mark Golan has a, has a way of kind of sneaking some fake stories every once in  a while. 
[113:00]
 Yeah.  To see if anyone would, you know, believe it.  Is paying attention.  I don't think he does it anymore.  I would believe it.  Maybe not to that extent.  Yeah, I'd, I'd believe it.  Cause, uh, you've never, you've never woke up in the middle of the night and you were  doing things to your, uh, chick.  I, what happens is I, I just take all my clothes off while I'm sleeping.  I wake up in just a wild state sometimes.  What, do you sleep in little jammy selfie?  Yeah, I do it.  Do you?  No, I don't, idiot.  Well, how could you take?  What, do you sleep in the nude? 
[113:30]
 How could you take?  You sleep in your jeans and your freaking, uh, leather coat?  How do you sleep?  Well, uh, you're saying you take your clothes off in your sleep.  Yeah, I got like, whatever, sweats, long johns.  Oh, so you're in bed and you're, you're wearing sweats and long johns.  And then also, I don't know if it's a dream I'm having or not, but also I'll just get,  I'll just get freaky and just like.  Get freaky.  Get naked and then, you know, hope to get something going on.  And maybe that's the problem.  Maybe you're wearing too many clothes to bed to get laid off.  Jesus Christ.  What, do you go to bed dressed like Kenny from South Park? 
[114:00]
 Come on, Chubby.  Go, go, go.  I didn't say I had a problem with my sex life, Anthony.  No, okay.  No, I'm usually.  I think like every guy out there, I want more and more and more, but, uh, it's not like,  it's not like it's, uh, completely dried up there.  It was just weird.  I didn't know you, uh, went to sleep, but clothed like that.  Yeah, I can't, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  A lot of guys sleep naked.  I just, I can, but.  I was wondering.  That's all.  All right.  So after sex, what do you do?  You get dressed again? 
[114:30]
 No, it depends when it happens.  Like you're, you're, it's, it's nighttime, right?  You go to bed, you're fiddling around a little bit.  You get into some sex, you finish.  If I, if I pass out, then yeah, whatever.  Then I don't need to get my clothes back.  And I know.  But then like there will be times you'll just like get dressed.  Okay.  All right.  Uh, this guy wants to abuse us.  Vin, what's up? 
[115:00]
 Yeah, guys, big fan of your show, but I'm real left down the way of ripping Angie Everhart  just cause Stern got a date with her.  Um, I'm not ripping her for that.  Dude, honestly.  What?  She's ugly?  She's all right.  She's all right.  She's a supermodel.  I didn't see her, so I don't even have a comment.  I've made out with better than that.  I've made out with better than that.  You okay.  You were throwing her out of bed.  I didn't say I would throw out of bed, but it's no big deal.  It's no big deal to supermodel, man.  I don't, I don't, I don't put her in the supermodel category when I saw it today. 
[115:30]
 I'm sorry.  All right.  Well, and I know it was a coincidence, but I know she used to sleep with was some slides  alone.  Have you been listening to our show?  Oh my God.  We just said something.  Dude, the fact is we passed on her.  There's nothing she's going to add to our radio show.  We completely passed on her.  Guys, you let me down.  I think, I think she's hot.  I'm trying to realize.  I don't know what I'm arguing with you about.  Wait, Vin.  I'm trying to see how we let this guy down. 
[116:00]
 Yeah, Vin, why did we let you down?  You think she's hot.  A lot of people think she's hot.  I looked at her and said, she's no big deal.  That's, that's, that's life.  Yeah, but I don't know.  I understand.  My point is that if Stern didn't ask her out or he didn't have her on, you guys wouldn't  say this.  And I'm a big fan of you two.  That's so.  That dude.  Wow.  You're reaching there.  You're really reaching.  Am I?  You can call us out if you want, but you're reaching on that one.  I'm serious.  It's really no big deal.  All right.  Hey, if I'm reaching, I apologize.  But I feel like, you know, if she wasn't on his show, you guys are like, ah, she was 
[116:30]
 not on here.  She's so hot.  Blah, blah, blah.  The fact is.  The fact is.  She's nothing, nothing special.  She was offered to, she was offered to us, I don't know, a few weeks ago and we passed  on her.  She's nothing.  She could really offer to the show.  My bad, Ben.  I apologize.  I apologize to you guys.  I'd rather have two girls in here that have never kissed before on the lesbian couch than  hear her babble about nothing, nothing.  I don't agree with you there.  I'd rather have that too, but I'm still saying she's hot. 
[117:00]
 That's all.  She's not a dog.  But, you know, I was expecting, I don't know, better, I guess.  Understandable.  All right.  I've never seen her in real life.  So I mean, I'll take you guys' word for it because everything you said in the last couple  years I've been listening to you has been true.  So I'll take that.  She's, I mean, obviously if I said, wow, she's a dog or ugly, duh, no.  I mean, she's.  All right.  I mean, but I guess she's just not my type.  Okay.  I'm taking it back, man.  Jesus.  Get off my ass.  You got to run.  All right, Ben. 
[117:30]
 All right.  Take it easy.  Bye.  Well, we got to talk to some of these people.  This could get wild.  Steven.  Yes, how are you guys?  Great.  I got a story.  I got a story.  You guys are just talking about doing things while people are sleeping and not realizing  it.  Sleep sex, yes.  Well, my fiance, she does it in her sleep.  One morning I woke up to her, you know, moaning and trying to move her under the covers and  so I pulled down the covers and there she is doing her deed to herself. 
[118:00]
 Wow.  And she's completely asleep?  Completely asleep.  That is a major turn on.  So what I did is I pulled down her panties and she's totally asleep.  All right, be careful.  So he just like, he sees opportunity right there.  Were you able to work your way in or what?  Well, I did the normal thing.  I was nice at first and then I, pleasure, you know, got out.  All right, just be careful.  So basically you joined in.  Yes.  And then I did the oral part. 
[118:30]
 Did she ever wake up?  Not at first.  And then I just got too aroused and I woke her up.  I couldn't deal with it.  She said, Oh, I was sleeping.  I wasn't doing nothing.  So we went away on vacation.  And then she is in the hotel room doing the same thing again.  Yeah.  So I said, that's it.  I bought a video camera because we're on vacation.  Oh man.  So I sent her a video on it and I'm doing what I have to do to her and she has no clue.  So about 15 minutes later, I woke her up and she's like, what are you doing?  Get off me.  I'm like, you started it.  She's like, how?  I played back the video. 
[119:00]
 She's like, that's me.  She has no clue.  Awesome.  Very good.  You guys are great.  Have a good time.  Thank you, Stephen.  Bye.  All right.  Listen, we got to take a quick break.  There's a ton of people on hold.  All you guys on hold stay right there.  Everyone has a story about sleep sex, including Sean.  Hold on just to make sure he stays.  Sean, we're going to you next.  We got to take a quick break though.  All right.  All right.  You got it.  All right.  Sean swears he had anal sleep sex.  I wonder who the guy was.  Oh, come on.  I'm kidding. 
[119:30]
 Stop.  Oh, be an entity.  Oh, those guys are bad.  One of seven.  W. N. E. W.  It's the O. P. Anthony show on one of two seven W. N. E. W.  Hey, so on the train last night, I have two choices, Anthony.  Yeah.  I could read all about the Time Warner AOL merger.  Yes.  Big news.  Huge news.  Huge merger.  Yeah.  It's going to pretty much affect every single person on this planet.  Yeah.  I'm going to go to the airport.  I'm going to go to the airport.  I'm going to go to the airport.  I'm going to go to the airport.  I'm going to go to the airport.  I'm going to go to the airport.  I'm going to go to the airport.  I'm going to go to the airport.  I'm going to go to the airport.  I'm going to go to the airport.  I'm going to go to the airport.  I'm going to go to the airport.  I'm going to go to the airport. 
[120:00]
 I'm going to go to the airport.  I'm going to go to the airport.  I'm going to go to the airport.  I'm going to go to the airport.  I'm going to go to the airport.  I'm going to go to the airport.  I'm going to go to the airport.  I'm going to go to the airport.  I'm going to go to the airport.  I'm going to go to the airport.  I'm going to go to the airport.  I'm going to go to the airport.  I'm going to go to the airport.  I'm going to go to the airport. 
[120:30]
 All right, so this is the story.  All right, now you've got to keep it really clean for the radio.  I'm trying.  You know the story.  All right, use the balloon knot for the back door, you know, talking coat.  Okay, you got it.  All right, again.  About a month ago, this was...  I was recently moving, so I had to stay on the couch. 
[121:00]
 So my girlfriend stayed over, so we're both, how do you say it, in spoon position.  Right.  Okay, so she's sleeping.  I didn't know it.  So, you know, I'm working something out, and I said, why not get it in there?  All right, listen.  Okay, okay, all right.  Hold on, I'll clean up.  Wait, you don't understand what sleep sex is.  No, no, no.  The person that is asleep is the one that is trying to have sex. 
[121:30]
 I mean, what you're doing is basically rape.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, listen.  You're having sex with your girlfriend that's unconscious.  She turns around.  Yeah.  I had a full session in one way, the regular way.  Right.  Then, towards the end, we worked towards the balloon mountain.  All right.  She asked for it, so I give it to her, right?  All right, yeah, be careful, okay?  Okay, so we wake up in the morning.  I'm happier than a pig in crap, you know?  So I talked to her about it, gloating. 
[122:00]
 I said, yeah, you know, I gave it to you good last night, huh?  She's that fat, huh?  And she's, no, she's 5'7".  Listen to me, yeah, I gave it to you pretty good last night, didn't I?  Yeah, I was proud of it.  Well, you did say pig in crap, okay.  No, no, not at all.  All right.  5'7", blonde, 112 pounds.  She runs for college on a scholarship, so picture the body.  Right.  So she turns around and says, what are you talking about?  So we argue about it for five or ten minutes. 
[122:30]
 I finally look down.  I got a little proof on me, so I show it to her.  There she goes.  She's good to go.  She believes me because I got a ride to the gravy stand.  All right, all right, I got the point.  Later.  Oh, he didn't get the train, damn it.  Everyone knows the train.  Claude, you're next on the show.  What's up?  Yeah, what's up, guys? 
[123:00]
 I had a friend who was sick in the hospital, and I had to sleep over,  so I wouldn't sleep in the visitor's lounge.  And it happens that I had a wet dream.  So I wake up, it's about 10 in the morning,  and there's like ten people in the visitor's lounge,  and they're all staring at me.  I don't know what took, was I like humping the sofa?  Oh, my God.  He was probably humping the sofa, yes.  I know.  Sandy, let's try to get this on track.  What's going on?  Hi, I have a sleep-sex story from a few years back. 
[123:30]
 Okay.  My ex-boyfriend, at the time we had just started seeing each other,  so we were kind of pretty hot and heavy, you know,  the way it was in the beginning.  And he was very, very surprised,  because we used to stay up late a lot.  And one morning, one night in the middle of the night,  he rolled over, and he just started, his hands were everywhere.  Okay.  Okay.  It must have lasted about five minutes,  and I realized he was asleep,  but it felt so good that I was like fine with it. 
[124:00]
 He woke up, and he was so embarrassed  by what he was doing that he tried to stop.  And now he goes back to sleep, and I'm laying there.  Ready to go, and he's done.  So I had to wake him back up and, like, make him finish.  Oh, that's funny.  It was pretty funny.  It was the one and only time it ever happened to me.  Very good.  But you enjoyed it?  Oh, yeah.  Why did you enjoy it?  Because he was just like another person pretty much?  Why didn't he enjoy it?  No, why did you enjoy it more than just the usual way? 
[124:30]
 Because he was like, it seemed like a different person,  seeing that you didn't know what you were doing.  There was nothing involved beforehand.  There was no real kind of foreplay.  You know, it was just kind of like all there all at once,  which was real different, you know?  Okay.  It was cool.  Very good.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  All right.  All right.  Did you reach over, though, and you're like, you know,  Amy just hung up.  We like hearing from the ladies.  They could explain it a little better.  When you're totally asleep, kind of reach over  and start like da-da-da-da-da-da, fiddling.  Mm-hmm. 
[125:00]
 Petting the poodles.  Sure.  It's like, oh, wake up.  Oh, my God.  What am I doing?  Petting the poodle.  Petting the poodle.  Chico wants to explain why sleep sex is better.  Chico, what do you have?  Yeah, I ain't doing.  Listen, I don't understand what's going on.  Some people don't even know what sleep sex is all about.  All right.  Hey, Chico, we're trying to guess races today.  Yeah, I understand that.  All right.  Let me, let me, let's see.  All right.  Can you talk, wait, wait.  Can you talk a little more?  Yeah, sure.  The thing is, when you live with a woman for 15 years, and then you get home. 
[125:30]
 All right, I got it, I got it, I got it.  You're Irish.  No, no, no, no.  Aw, damn.  You're off.  I'm Puerto Rican.  Aw, see?  That was my second choice.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, all right.  I guess you can't, I guess you can't do that all the time, man.  No.  Guess someone's race by their voice.  He totally sounded Irish.  He didn't sound Puerto Rican at all.  Exactly.  Yeah.  All right, go ahead, Chico.  Yeah, I mean.  Chico, that should have gave it away.  I mean, aw.  Even the name.  Man, yeah, man, you live with a woman for 15 years, right? 
[126:00]
 Now, women are the ones that are mostly complaining, but I don't hear really no guys complaining,  right?  Now, the thing is, they go in and you get home from work all tired, you go to sleep,  right?  Now, you actually, when you get home, you thinking you're going to find something beautiful.  But after looking at all these women outside, and they got these beautiful figures, right?  And this beautiful body, and you get home and you see a 500 pound monkey with a mustache,  you don't want to have sex with them.  Oh my God. 
[126:30]
 You understand what I'm saying?  A 500 pound monkey with a mustache.  Yeah, you know?  So you get home, you go lay down, right?  After you do whatever you got to do.  Then you'll be dreaming about having sex with these beautiful women.  So when you finally wake up, you're on top of that 500 pound monkey.  That's what I'm saying?  It almost feels like that hot supermodel from the street, right?  Yeah.  Exactly.  Be careful with the curse in there.  Yeah.  So I mean, you catch yourself, but after you're done, you're like, oh, no problem. 
[127:00]
 Meanwhile, the monkey's thinking everything is fine.  You understand what I'm saying?  I'm thinking, oh, you know, I know I was great.  But when you get up in the morning and you finally realize what you've done, you're like,  oh my God, I did it again.  And then the 500 pound monkey is having a whole bunch of little monkeys.  All right, guys.  You're in hell, Chico, aren't you?  Take care.  Bye-bye.  I'm just going to pay attention in the barn instead of trying to pick up the women at  5 to 4 a.m. 
[127:30]
 Joyce, you're next on the radio show.  What's going on?  Hi, how are you?  Great.  I just want to tell you that sometimes I prefer that.  I prefer the middle of the night to the middle of the day, only because it's such a surprise.  I'm expecting a baby every five months pregnant, so I really have energy during the day.  I come home from work, I go to sleep, whatever, and then, listen, there's a surprise.  Sometimes I initiate it.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  It's much better.  But is either you or him completely asleep when it's going on? 
[128:00]
 He is completely out.  Completely out.  I'll wake up and I'll say, okay, let's see if I can get him started.  Oh, it doesn't take more than 30 seconds.  Wow.  Yes.  All right.  Well, thank you, Joyce.  Take care.  Bye-bye.  Kelly, you're next.  Kelly?  Hi.  Hi, you're on the radio.  First of all, this happens to me and my boyfriend all the time.  He's the deepest sleeper.  He'll wake me up in the middle of the night and he'll be doing stuff to me. 
[128:30]
 I love it.  Also, it's happened to me before where I've done it to my ex-boyfriend.  I woke up in the middle of the night and I was touching him.  I didn't even know it.  The next day he woke me up and he said, do you remember doing that last night?  I had no idea.  I think it happens to girls and guys.  That's so erotic, man.  Yeah, well.  What can I say?  That rocks, right?  Come on.  Why is everyone laughing at me?  All right, you guys.  Take it easy.  Thank you, Kelly.  Bye.  Bye.  You don't think that's cool? 
[129:00]
 Awesome.  Chris, what's up?  Nothing.  What's going on, guys?  All right, man.  Listen, one night sleeping, wake up to my old lady, moan and groan a little bit.  She's having an orgasm right next to me.  I'm not even touching her.  She's not even touching herself.  What do you think about that?  And she's completely asleep?  Totally asleep.  That's...  I'd love to check that out.  I mean, it was cool, but you know, like, I wish I was in on it a little bit, you know? 
[129:30]
 Nah, man.  You got to sit back and just watch that.  That doesn't come around every day.  That's something you go, wow, I'm going to check this out.  Eh, you know.  What are you going to do?  All right.  All right, guys.  I got to go.  Thank you, Chris.  Bye.  Rob?  Hey, Rob.  Hey, what's up, guys?  How's it going?  Good.  I hope you were talking before about how you have to get dressed afterwards to go back to  sleep.  No.  Honestly, it was misinterpreted.  Sometimes yes, sometimes no.  It all depends on what's going on. 
[130:00]
 Well, I don't know.  I guess it's a little crazy, a little whacked out, but no matter what, I have to go to sleep  with socks on.  So even after, like, sex with my wife, I'll turn around, you know, even if I find myself  just starting to pass out, I'll have to throw my socks back on like my feet get dry.  They touch, they drive me nuts if anybody touches my feet.  So no matter what, even afterwards, I still got to get back up, throw the socks back on  and I can just go to bed, start naked, just socks on.  Kind of odd, waking up in the morning going to make a pot of coffee with, you know, Big 
[130:30]
 Jim and the twins hanging out and wearing a pair of socks.  Big Jim and the twins.  Actually, you're twigging berries.  Oh, yeah.  No, that's funny, though.  Thank you, Rob.  No problem.  Take it easy, guys.  All right.  We'll take two more.  We like hearing from the ladies.  Kelly?  Yeah.  A lot of Kelly's checking in today.  How are you?  Hey.  All right.  How are you guys doing today?  You got a sleep-sex story?  Oh, God, yeah.  My husband does this to me all the time.  I was having this dream one night. 
[131:00]
 I was on the love boat and Captain Steubing was walking me around the love boat.  Oh, God.  And my husband's like...  And Isaac, your bartender gave you the high-hard one?  No.  He was...  Gopher started nibbling.  No, no, no.  Listen.  Listen.  Captain Steubing is walking me around the love boat.  My husband is diddling me while I'm asleep.  And I look over at Captain Steubing and he's got his hand on me and he's working me.  Captain Harold Steubing. 
[131:30]
 Did Julie, your cruise director, give you a blast of Coke and then go south?  You know, and I mean, I guess I started getting a little bit of a...  You know, and I mean, I guess I started getting into an awesome Captain Steubing turn into my cat.  And I think that's because my husband was using, you know, the P word.  Right.  You know?  Captain Steubing on the love boat.  The next thing I know, I'm having sex with my cat on the love boat.  Give me some bald head. 
[132:00]
 That's funny.  You're into that Meryl Steubing look?  With his wacky little captain uniform and his big bald head.  I just love a man in uniform.  Alright, Kelly.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  It's one of those wacky dreams though that just goes all over the ball field.  Some of those are pretty funny.  I hate those.  Captain Steubing.  Turns into the cat.  Yeah.  And you don't think twice about it.  Right.  It's a stupid dream.  You wake up and you're like, oh, that makes sense.  You want to tell the whole world and then you start remembering details. 
[132:30]
 Wait a minute.  Maybe I should keep this one in myself.  That made no sense.  Jesse.  Hello.  How are you?  Good.  I pretend to be having sleep sex sometimes.  You have sleep sex?  No, I pretend to.  I pretend I'm asleep because that way you can do the things that you would normally do  that you won't.  You know what I mean?  You put on a personality that you don't want him to know that you have.  And what do you usually pretend?  Usually I start by pleasuring myself because I know that kind of turns him on. 
[133:00]
 And you can't do that when you're awake?  I like for him to think that I'm a little bit more demure than that.  So when I pretend that I am, then I am a lot more wild.  So you make believe you're completely out cold and you're playing with yourself, knowing  he's watching you open your eyes every once in a while to see if he's checking it out.  Absolutely.  And then he'll start and I'll talk dirty.  We'll do the whole nine. 
[133:30]
 And it's absolutely in the scene of sex because he thinks I'm completely asleep.  The next morning he'll be like, oh my God, you have no idea what you did.  I'm like, oh no, you're right.  That's not me.  I can't believe I did that.  So I get to keep the whole demure act up at the same time.  You ladies have a racket.  I'm telling you.  Jesus.  Yeah, he pretty much seems to enjoy it too.  Very good.  Thank you.  All right, Jesse.  I think Jesse has the best story of the day.  That was pretty good. 
[134:00]
 All right, we got to take another quick break.  I think we could do one more segment on this that people are calling like crazy.  Oh yeah.  Sleep sex with Asians, lost gum and girls.  Oh my God.  Look at line four.  That one's great.  Girl likes to sleep with junk in her mouth.  It's like a pacifier.  If you're a faithful listener to the show, it's great to talk in code and everyone knows  what you're talking about.  Line 10, sleep sex first time with balloon knot.  We'll get to more of your calls in just a bit. 
[134:30]
 Don't forget today is Tuesday.  Looking for a bunch of people to join the Tuesday Night Hummer Club, Anthony.  Absolutely.  I guess we could go to this little ditty from Air Sick Productions.  I think they explain the Tuesday Night Hummer Club, right?  Yes.  People love this damn thing.  Hummerlovin' on 1027 WNEW. 
[135:00]
 We love Tuesday night.  Hummer, hummer, hummer, hummer.  Tell me more, tell me more.  We don't care where we are.  Tell me more, tell me more.  Do we fight in the car? 
[135:30]
 She came to me, I dropped my pants.  You owe this to all the in-ants.  I'll call them up when you go down.  All the hears are slipping sound.  Hummer's done.  Get me some gum.  Oh, we love Hummer night.  Tell me more, tell me more.  I don't mean to offend.  Tell me more, tell me more. 
[136:00]
 Now can you do my friend?  I exploded.  That's where it ends.  I have got the world's best girlfriend.  I love to be in his lap.  Think it's time.  Oh, it took a nap. 
[136:30]
 Hummer's done.  There's more to come.  But more.  So come Hummer night.  Baby, love, baby, love. 
[137:00]
 On the way, 1027 WNEW.  I love this bet, huh?  Yeah, yeah baby.  Yeah, you're gonna get it.  I'm gonna slam it in you, baby.  That's what it sounds like.  It's like porno music.  Yeah. 
[137:30]
 You turn over.  You lock it in the butt.  1027 WNEW.  Hey, it's Sofie and Anthony.  Yeah, baby, don't wake up.  Use the sleep.  Sleep sex.  Where do we go, where do we go, where do we go?  All right, let's go to Larry.  Hey, Larry, you're next on the program.  What's going on?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  All right.  I got a story about sleep sex for you.  Okay.  I went on vacation last summer with a friend of mine. 
[138:00]
 Just friends.  And she's hot.  She's so hot.  Like 5'3", tight little swimmer's body, big like 36D chest.  Right?  So we're going on vacation.  Our hotel reservations get messed up.  So we have to sleep in the back of my truck.  So in the middle of the night, all of a sudden, she like rolls over on top of me and just  starts going at it.  Yeah.  Just, oh, so good.  This girl is so hot.  To this day, she has no idea.  You didn't even bring it up the next day? 
[138:30]
 Nope.  You know, I had a crush on her and like things never worked out.  So she never said anything the next day?  She had no idea.  To this day, she has no idea.  Did you guys do it?  Do it?  What?  Did you do it?  Do it?  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  She had to have known.  Maybe she did.  But, you know, I don't know.  I was afraid to bring it up because I brought it up before.  I tried to like, you know, I tried to get with her.  It never happened.  Yeah.  And then I just figured that was nice.  Right. 
[139:00]
 That was awesome.  That sounds like you remember it like it was yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All right, Larry.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  Later.  Wow, that's cool.  Richie.  Hey.  What's up?  What's up, guys?  Not much.  You guys are on Abundant Ball.  Just want to say that.  Oh, thanks.  Listen, I play in the band.  It's not quite sex, but it's the same type of sleep story.  I play in the band.  We used to rehearse at the best person's house.  I play the guitar.  I play asleep in out cold.  Gets up out of nowhere.  Just like that.  I don't know what they dumped out of, but basically... 
[139:30]
 Yeah, he took a leak on the wall.  Oh, sorry.  Sorry, guys.  And what?  He was asleep?  He was asleep.  He gets back, walks back over to the couch.  Out.  Back to sleep.  Unbelievable.  Not quite sex, but...  Yeah.  Not quite like it, but it just blew me away.  We were laughing.  We were dying.  Right.  Well, thank you, Richie.  All right, guys.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Dominic, you're next on the program.  What's going on? 
[140:00]
 Hey, what's going on there, big guy?  This is Dominic from Staten Island.  Big guy.  Hey, champ.  A lot of the guys are here coming on here.  I cannot...  All right, chief.  I kind of feel like they're full of it.  All right, friend.  If you...  Why, dude?  If you ask me, with the guy that said his girlfriend was satisfying herself...  Okay, bro.  ...under the covers with the video...  Yeah.  ...put that on Sound Your Music.com, I'll believe it.  There you go.  Listen, if you would turn around and say, listen, did anyone out there that has a girlfriend  say, hey, I'm going to go to the gym?  Well, I believe in the sleep sex thing.  I believe it's happening.  Yeah, well, I believe it's happening, too, but I don't believe it's happening as much  as I mean even on the radio.  I thought it was interesting that one girl makes believe she's asleep so she can do things  she would normally not do when she was awake.  Oh, yeah, that's cool.  I hate this. 
[140:30]
 I love that.  Or she like plays with herself because you can't do it, you know, if she's asleep.  I mean, I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing. 
[141:00]
 I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing. 
[141:30]
 I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  Can you hear me?  Yeah, I got it.  So, the only problem, she was very kind of prim and proper and kind of boring and just  wasn't all that exciting.  One night I'm sound asleep and it's like the chick out of Ghostbusters. 
[142:00]
 Okay, she wakes me up, she's got like two heads on herself just ripping me apart.  I mean I wake up the next morning, I got like bruises on me, I'm scratched.  She has completely pulled a civil.  And I asked her, I said, what happened last night?  And she said, the rest of my relationship, all she did was a little meek smile and that  was the last episode for the little episode. 
[142:30]
 I guess every now and then you just got to let it loose.  There you go.  It was a beautiful thing.  Thanks for sharing today, Jack.  You got it, man.  On the instant feedback, Kevin from New Jersey, Anthony.  Isn't this subject painfully close to crossing the border of rape?  Yeah, well we're talking about the person being asleep initiating the sex.  Yeah, I guess that's the big difference.  Yeah.  If you look over and you see like, you know, your lady completely out cold and then you 
[143:00]
 decide you're going to have your way with her because she's not going to wake up.  That might be a little different than what we're trying to talk about here today.  Yes.  Just a little bit.  Especially if you don't know her.  Yeah, could get a little rough.  Could get a little rough.  Maybe she should lock her windows at night.  I'm just waiting for Spasm with Jennifer on hold so we can move on here.  Oh, yeah.  Thank you.  That's it.  That's it.  Hey, Jennifer.  Yeah.  You got something to add to this or what? 
[143:30]
 Well, basically this is a story from college.  I had gone out with my sorority, got a little drunk, was coming back to my boyfriend's dorm  and for the life of me in this dorm I could never find his room because all the rooms  looked the same to me, whatever.  So I guess I went in and by the way, I didn't know this.  I went into an Amish guy's bed and ripped naked, climbed into bed with him and tried 
[144:00]
 to start stuff.  Wow.  I guess he wrapped me up in a blanket and brought me to my boyfriend's room and asked  is this yours?  Oh, the Amish aren't they nice?  But I guess a couple weeks later he dropped out of school.  Really?  Yeah, I hope I didn't have anything to do with that.  I'd have banged you, you know?  Quite honestly, a naked girl just crawls in your bed and starts doing things.  You're getting slammed.  What's very scary is no one actually knows except for him. 
[144:30]
 He's guilt-ridden now.  Yeah, that's why he dropped out.  Screwed him up.  He's probably building barns every weekend now because he's a barn raiser.  He's raised something in his pants and he's all guilty.  All right, Jennifer.  All right, thanks.  You guys talk.  Thank you.  Bye.  I knew we had women listeners, Anthony.  Of course we do.  Debbie, you're next on NEW.  Hi.  Hi.  I never called in before, but I've been listening.  I'm driving home. 
[145:00]
 I just have to say this happens to me all the time when I'm asleep.  My husband will tell me the next morning when we woke up that last night was great.  And I'll be like, what?  Or all the time.  Really?  I sleep.  When I fall asleep I can have complete conversations with people and not even realize I was active.  I think I slept fine the whole night through.  I don't remember anything.  So what do you do when you're sleeping?  Apparently I become aggressive.  We'll be asleep and he'll come over and give me a kiss good night and I'll start kissing him and that's it. 
[145:30]
 And then I'll wake up the next day.  I don't remember it and he'll bring it up and I'll be like, I knew it.  You were sleeping again.  He doesn't know.  He doesn't know if I'm asleep or awake because my eyes are wide open and I'm talking to him, but I'm passed out.  That's creepy.  It is a little creepy.  To sleepwalking where your eyes are open, that's creepy.  Yeah, I know.  But you just turn into an animal when you're sleeping?  Well, either way.  But yeah, I satisfy him.  That's cool.  But it's funny because I used to do an overnight shift at a job. 
[146:00]
 I had to stop because I was helping people and letting them in and not even remembering until the next day when I rung them up and everything.  Wow.  Yeah.  But that's it.  All right, Debbie.  I love your show.  I listen to you every day on the way home.  Hey, thank you.  How's the traffic today?  It sucks.  I'm in Southern State right now.  All right.  And it's really bad.  All I see is our taillights.  Pretty much sucks every day, doesn't it, Debbie?  No, actually there are days that are worse than other.  I don't know.  There's an accident up ahead because I see lights. 
[146:30]
 All right.  Flashing lights.  But OK.  All right, Debbie.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  I just don't understand traffic.  It just sucks every day.  Every day.  Everyone knows their alternate routes.  You know?  Yeah.  Why do you need someone to tell you where the traffic is every day?  Well, that never works either.  They tell you where the jam is.  You avoid it.  And there's a jam where they told you to go.  Right.  Can't win, Anthony.  No.  Hey, Mark, what's up?  Yo, what's going on, dog?  Yo, I've had sleep sets so many times.  And it's like you just wake up and you're like, all right, well, I guess I might as  well keep on railroading.  I mean, I'm already halfway in.

[153:30]
 that's calling me by another name and she's saying, Sal, I want you so bad.  Sal, I'm thinking, my name's not Sal, but I'll play along with this.  And she's going, Sal, Sal, I want you.  Now, let me induct you into the Hummer Club.  So I'm like, this is cool.  And she starts going for it.  And I'm getting close and I'm getting close and she's like, give it to me, Sal, give it  to me. 
[154:00]
 And I did.  And I basically drowned her.  She started gagging and choking and going up saying, you know, she wakes up and she  is screaming at me, what are you doing?  What are you doing?  And I just looked at her and called me and said, well, who's Sal?  That wasn't me, it was Sal.  Do you know any Sal's?  Sal is her personal trainer.  Oh, so you know the guy she's talking about.  I know the guy she's talking about and she was in her sleep.  She was thinking she was doing him.  And it doesn't bother you? 
[154:30]
 Yeah, it's girlfriend.  Oh, there you go.  You guys rule.  Thank you.  One more and we'll move on.  Donna.  Yes.  I think we're going to finish up with you.  What's up?  I was just saying, I don't know if this constitutes, but I love to wake up my boyfriend every  morning with a Hummer.  There you go.  That's pretty nice.  That is a very nice lady.  That's mighty sweet of you.  That is that that's probably one of the best things you could ever do to your man.  Beach bacon and eggs.  Or that Maxwell House coffee. 
[155:00]
 I mean, it's there anyway.  Why waste it?  You know, wow.  More women should think like you, Donna.  Do we have a prize for Donna?  We're going to hook you up with something.  Are you?  That's great.  Are you kidding me?  How many times a week do you do that to him?  Almost every day.  Oh, my God.  Really?  Guy has no idea how lucky he's got it.  All right.  Hold on the line.  All right.  OK.  All right.  Waking up with a Hummer. 
[155:30]
 All right.  All right.  Let's wow.  Let's play some music and regroup here.  I'm just.  Yeah.  I don't want to talk to her some more.  Look, I'm giving her a prize.  OK.  Really?  We'll be back.  Couple of tunes.  Little break.  It's Metallica.  One oh two seven W.N.E.W.  One oh two seven W.N.E.W.  Rage Against the Machine, Gorilla Radio.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  If you have something for the show, 
[156:00]
 we're going to try to move on with other things today.  Two one two seven five seven one oh two seven.  Up next on the show, Chris.  Chris, what's going on?  What's going on, Opie?  All right.  Anthony, what's up?  Hello?  You're up.  You're up, man.  Opie, did you beat Medal of Honor yet or no?  Actually, Psycho Mark gave me Medal of Honor to try out.  I don't know, man.  I got to say.  They're ranting or raving about Medal of Honor.  I think it's the best game ever. 
[156:30]
 I got to admit, I only played the beginning of the game.  I wasn't really into it.  What type of game is it?  It's first person perspective, doom type of game.  And I'll tell you why I couldn't get into it.  Because I watch Ant every day before the show,  just going nuts in Half Life online, multiplayer.  And then you get Medal of Honor on PlayStation.  And to me, it's a little primitive.  I was also looking for codes.  Because they have codes for infinite ammo. 
[157:00]
 Sheet codes, sure.  You get them on websites.  Or you get them even in some magazines.  And some of the electronics boutique  has whole sheet books and stuff.  Yeah, do you have a computer?  No.  Well, I have a crap one.  Well, find a friend that has a good computer.  Go to Yahoo, punch in Medal of Honor,  and a crap load of stuff will pop up as far as cheat codes  and stuff go.  All right, one more question.  Yeah, but I mean, in all fairness, 
[157:30]
 Psycho Mark loved Medal of Honor.  That's one of my favorite games ever.  I've played Half Life.  Ant showed me around the Half Life game.  I'm not like type of person that sits at that hard chair  and plays with the mouse.  I like in my couch, you know, doing a nice beer pop.  Oh, believe me.  I do the same thing.  Beer.  One more question.  When is your CD coming out, man?  I've been waiting since October for this. 
[158:00]
 Well, you know, we have new management here at WNEW.  And they are, as we speak, trying to make it happen.  Oh, word, man.  They shoved the whole project back in the lawyers' faces  and said, make this work.  Right.  Make this work for the guys.  That's what I'm talking about.  All right, man.  All right.  Man, you guys suck.  Is that a train, bro?  All right.  Thank you.  I don't know if cringe will ever make it out, but we'll see.  I hope so.  Money Talks, though, in this company,  I said, do you guys realize how much money our CD will make? 
[158:30]
 I know.  Between our audience in New York and our audience in Boston,  a double CD for our listeners?  I hope it does now.  Jesus Christ, that would suck if it didn't, huh?  Nah, it's a guarantee.  We're really proud of the project.  So we'll see what happens.  That game Rick got me, that Unreal tournament?  Mm-hmm.  Oh my god, that's good.  I put up there too with Half-Life as far as playing online.  Yeah.  Half-Life was a great game for one player  when you're just getting on and playing the whole game. 
[159:00]
 A lot of the games coming out now like Unreal and Quake 3,  Arena, they're made for online play, which is great.  I mean, they're great multiplayer games.  But I have not seen one thing come close  to how good Half-Life was to just run through  as a single player game.  Really?  Fantastic.  System Shock 2, pretty close, pretty good.  The other one, Half-Life, the second one that just came out  that I just finished, Opposing Force, pretty good,  but not as good as the original. 
[159:30]
 A lot of the same stuff going on.  I'm doing Tomb Raider, Last Revelation right now.  How's that working for you?  It's getting...  It's a really good game because it starts out really easy  and just gets harder as the game goes,  and kind of like that.  So I mean, right now it's just getting really frustrating.  But it's all right.  I'm waiting for the new Team Fortress 2 to come out  from Half-Life.  And in the meantime, I'm actually playing  the original Half-Life again on expert setting, Opie.  Very difficult to get through. 
[160:00]
 But I know it's common, so it kind of sucks.  I wish they'd come out with another really good game  like that.  I mean, to this day, though, I mean,  my two favorite PlayStation games,  Siphon Filter.  Yeah, that one was good.  That was really good.  And Silent Hill.  Yeah, that was scary.  Silent Hill is just...  Man, I like crap like that.  I like the creepy stuff, the stuff with the story behind it,  the stuff you got to kind of think and shoot.  You got to get a PlayStation player, Silent Hill.  And you would really enjoy it.  And the puzzles are kind of a little tricky. 
[160:30]
 You got to think a little bit.  I'm pretty...  And the creatures are great.  The nurses with the hearts beating on their back  on the outside of their skin.  And the dogs that attack you that have like...  It looks like they've been torn inside out.  And they run around...  Oh, it's just great.  I need graphics now, though.  I really do.  I mean, I need the top of the line graphics.  So PlayStation, I don't know,  I might be a little disappointed.  Every time I pick up a PlayStation game,  they're just moving forward with the graphics 
[161:00]
 and everything else, though.  I mean, Last Revelation, Tomb Raider,  the graphics are so much better on that game  than it was for Tomb Raider III.  And it's only like, what, a year and a half difference  in the two games.  Yeah.  I mean, I'd get one of those just so I could like...  You should hang out on the couch and stuff.  It's great.  Better than just sitting at the computer.  On those Sony Tron glasses we got?  Yeah.  So now you can like, lay on your couch  with your head all the way back on a pillow  and you can play the game on the ceiling.  I got to check that.  Or it looks like it's on the ceiling  with those Sony glasses they gave us. 
[161:30]
 That's great.  Jim, what's up?  Yeah, listen, you already said you played Siphon Filter, but...  Wait, were you feeling a little jealous there, Jim?  He was listening to the show and he heard us.  I said, you know, laying on my back,  playing PlayStation with the glasses,  looks like it's on the ceiling.  I'm dying.  I'm sitting here dying.  I got a 35-inch TV I played on,  but I'd rather have the glasses.  I picked up on some though,  because you didn't know we went to you and I hear,  oh, that's great, right?  I wish I had that.  Oh, I need that.  Yeah, really?  I thought I'd price it.  I heard about it from you guys and I priced it, man. 
[162:00]
 I'm looking at that and go, wow.  Yeah.  Gotta go there.  Yeah.  The price is up there, but the price is going to come down like crazy  because it's going to be the new rage very soon.  That's what I'm waiting for.  So what?  PC game.  Yeah.  Hidden and Dangerous.  Hidden and Dangerous?  Is that that World War II one?  Yeah, the graphics on that are pretty good.  Yeah, I was looking at that.  That looked pretty good.  I play it.  I have it at home.  It's decent.  It really is.  Is it a first-person shooter, you know?  It can be.  It's both a first-person and a strategy shooter,  and you can take your pick in the sniper mode on that thing.  It's awesome.  God, I love the sniper mode in any game. 
[162:30]
 Oh, give me the sniper rifle.  Zoom in and just take off some heads.  And absolutely.  The sniper feature is hitting every game,  because even Tomb Raider has now a sniper feature.  Sniper feature.  There's nothing better than on the crossbow, man.  Zooming in and just watching like in Half-Life.  When you use the crossbow, you zoom in, you just boom,  and you see the guy just fly back.  It's like, oh, I didn't even know I was there.  This thing is cool.  You can take over tanks.  You can shoot tanks.  You can shoot from the tank. 
[163:00]
 You can shoot off machine guns.  You take over weapons.  You drive trucks.  And the enemy is intelligent.  It hears you.  And it comes looking for you.  That's a lot the way it is with Half-Life, too.  Yeah, that's a good thing.  Artificial intelligence.  It's great.  Like they chase you, the soldiers in Half-Life.  If you come around the corner and one sees you and you run away,  it doesn't matter.  They're chasing you.  They'll throw grenades at you, and they're accurate.  Absolutely.  Good stuff.  It's fun, man.  Can you imagine another five years?  It's just going to be completely out of hand, the game.  Yeah, much better. 
[163:30]
 All right, Jim.  Yeah, you take care.  You guys are great.  Thank you.  All I wanted when I was a kid, too, was like games and computer games  were like in its infancy.  But I wanted them.  I wanted to play them.  I loved them.  I went to some stupid arcade where I would pump quarter after quarter  into a machine to land a lunar module.  Remember that?  And you had a little stick with thrust control buttons,  and you had to land the thing.  And you had to figure out to make sure you had enough gas, right?  All that.  And make sure you didn't come in too fast or the thing would crash. 
[164:00]
 This was the best thing in the world.  I completely remember that.  And it was ridiculous.  Two-dimensional little lunar lander would come off of the command module  you had to turn it with the retros and slowly bring it down  without running out of gas, like you said, and keep it so you wouldn't drift to the left or right.  And I was like, oh, I need this for my house.  It's this big clunky unit.  So whenever new games come out or new technology comes out, I got to have it.  That's how you know.  What if I put a slide of Voodoo 2 graphics card on my computer?  Three weeks later, Voodoo 3 is out. 
[164:30]
 Oh, Voodoo 2 goes to my brother, Joe.  See you later.  Boom, Voodoo 3 goes in the machine.  Yeah.  You know how we laugh at the first computer games and stuff?  Yeah.  You're thinking like 10, 15 years, people are going to just be laughing at what the games were  in the year 2000.  I'm sure they will be because it's going that fast.  Like, look five years ago what the graphics looked like.  And look at them now.  It's just going to get that much better.  There's a graphics card coming out that, of course, I'm going to have to have  that has to plug in to the wall. 
[165:00]
 Now, you plug the card into the back of your computer.  A plug comes in for the fan to cool the processor off because it's handling so much of the graphics  that it overheats.  So it's a fan that has to plug into your wall just for the graphics card.  Wow.  Oh, I need it.  I need it now.  That's got to be good.  I want a water-cooled graphics card.  I want something that looks like a big engine on my living room floor pumping glycol through 
[165:30]
 my computer to keep it cool because of my graphics card.  Yeah, Timothy, you're next.  Hey, what's up, guys?  All right.  All right, I just want to say most of the games, Medal of Honor and Silent Hill, I played them all.  Medal of Honor I beat.  I beat it with the Bronze Star.  Did you like Medal of Honor?  Yeah, as you guys were saying about the soldiers being smart, they're the same thing in that game.  Like, I throw a grenade at them, they pick it up and throw it right back at me.  And throw it in the hot air.  And they have bazookas and they lock up, you shoot the guy in the head. 
[166:00]
 And then next thing you know, he pulls out a bazooka and like blows me away.  I mean, the game's getting rave reviews, but the graphics are just a little primitive for me.  You start off here in the woods and all that.  I mean, that's kind of hard.  But then you get to like inside the buildings into a V2 rocket plan, all this cool stuff.  Oh, cool.  Maybe I should play the game a little further then.  You even get to get onto a U-boat and all that and blow it up and submerge it.  And that sounds cool.  It's cool.  Well, I'm going to give it another try then.  And I played the Ultra Lunar Lander game.  That's pretty cool too.  Yeah, remember that?  Yeah, I remember that.  Yeah, I remember that.  Yeah, I remember that.  Yeah, I remember that.  Yeah, I remember that.  Yeah, I remember that.  Yeah, it's like the kind of moon wind kind of blow you back and forth. 
[166:30]
 You got to like move it and go too fast.  Even when I saw Pong, I was mesmerized.  A stupid little ball going back and forth with the paddles.  How the hell they figure out how you can play a game on your TV?  Only movie stars are on TV, Opie.  Look, now I'm playing a game on the TV.  I must be special.  Let me get up and turn the channel, see what's on.  I was always jealous watching Wondorama that they would give away one of those Pong games. 
[167:00]
 A Pong game and a Ross Apollo bicycle.  And now the Snake Can game.  And it was like, oh, if I could only get on Wondorama,  and Bob McAllister could give me a Pong game.  Yeah, ain't happening.  All right, Timothy, thank you.  Well, one more thing about Silent Hill.  Yeah.  I was going to say, I've made it to the end.  I mean, I won't spoil it because I know that  the guys are trying to get some information out of me,  but I don't want to spoil it for him or any of that.  Right.  I got to the end of the game,  and you have to get this one thing in order to get to this place.  You can't get the thing without like... 
[167:30]
 Well, I can't.  I'll tell you off there or whatever, but I know hard.  There's like what?  Four or five endings that damn game.  Yeah, there's different endings,  and I have to get this one thing in order to get to get it.  Right.  I'll tell you this, it's electrified.  In order to get to get the stuffy electricity off.  Right, right, right.  You have to take an elevator to get it.  Right.  And since you turned the electricity off,  you can't take the elevator, so I'm like, screwed.  Right.  I'm in like one place.  Right.  I beat it.  I'm trying to remember what I did,  because that goes back about a year and a half now.  Yeah, same with me.  I haven't played in a while, 
[168:00]
 and I thought I was in the hospital,  and Spads is like proving me wrong.  You know what I mean?  Oh, really?  I can't remember.  I don't remember that much.  I can't remember.  I can't remember what I ate for lunch, man.  Yeah.  All right, Timmy.  After flashback.  There you go.  Thanks.  All right, man.  Take it easy.  You guys suck.  All right, man.  One more.  Greg?  Hey, Greg.  What's up?  What's up, guys?  Love the show, been listening for a long time.  Wanted to talk to Ant.  Yeah.  Ant, have you tried the tribes game online yet?  Not online, no.  Dude, you got to try that out. 
[168:30]
 I heard it's really good.  It's unbelievable.  You get on there.  You get to choose from three different armor types,  like light, medium, or heavy armor.  You get all these different kinds of guns.  You got to check out this.  They got this disk launcher.  Yeah, that sounds like Unreal Tournament.  They have something that launches like saw blades  at the other people.  It's pretty cool.  Yeah.  I think that the tribes game predates the Unreal game.  Yeah, it does.  I mean, a lot of the tribes tournaments, 
[169:00]
 you're battling on these floating command posts,  whatever, and you have jet packs,  and you can jump from post to post and just ride ships  and stuff like that.  Oh, it's great.  Yeah, I love those online games, man.  I play Half-Life online all the time.  And there's some people that really piss me off  because they're really good.  I consider myself pretty good at it.  But some of these guys will just rip you a new ass.  Now, which one do you play, Team Fortress 
[169:30]
 or Opposing Force online?  I play Half-Life, the regular one, Team Fortress  and Opposing Force.  I like that being a sniper on Team Fortress  take off some heads.  It's fun, man.  It's great.  And people are like, oh, it's promoting violence.  No, it relaxes the hell out of you.  When you're pissed off and you get on the computer  you whack a few people with a shotgun.  Oh, it's great.  There you go.  Thank you, Greg.  You guys, before you settle down and have kids, 
[170:00]
 get all the gaming in while you can because I have a 20-month-old  and forget about it.  It's all over, huh?  It's all over.  I would think you'd play more games  because you get up in the middle of the night  because they're crying and you throw your game on a little bit  while they're going back to sleep.  I get about two hours a night and that's between the game  and my wife and the TV and cleaning the house.  Oh, look, he's in hell.  Can't wait.  You got your own video game you're playing.  It's called your life and it's hell.  It's scarier than any of the ones we play.  And the goal is how to get out of hell. 
[170:30]
 How do I get out?  How does this game end?  I need a cheat code.  That's a good one, guys.  I need unlimited ammo.  All right, Greg.  Take it easy, fellas.  I need to be in god mode.  Uh, Lancelot from Jersey, get off the video games  and start talking about lesbians.  Oh, please.  Come on.  Let's go to Vicky.  Hey, Vicky.  Yeah.  What's up?  What's the matter?  You are really scaring me here.  Why? What's the matter?  You're talking about snipers.  Like, they're real people. 
[171:00]
 Oh, it's great.  Yeah, but they're not real.  No, you know what it is?  When you play online, the person you're shooting on the screen  is sitting at his computer somewhere in the world  and that's who you're killing.  You're killing his little character.  So you're not just playing against that.  Now I know why your wife freaks out.  My what?  Your wife.  When you play these games.  Oh, look at the time.  We got to take a break.  Yeah, we'll get into that.  Now, you're really...  Do you guys remember Asteroids?  Yeah, Asteroids, Space Invaders.  Do you remember the lines on the screen? 
[171:30]
 Yeah.  Oh, man.  But you were scaring me, Anthony.  He used to get drunk at Cedar Pub  and play Asteroids for hours on end.  Yeah, just remember that they're not real, OK?  All right, Vicky.  They are, Vicky.  I'm the defender of the world.  If I falter for a second, everyone perishes.  I'll remember if I'm online, if I get shot, it's you.  Yes.  Frag monster.  Frag monster is Anthony's little thing.  That's me.  Now you shouldn't probably be talking so bad.  I'm the Frag Monster, 10-10-10-8 on the side. 
[172:00]
 Well, you know, you realize now that you've just doomed yourself.  That's all right.  I'll frag anybody.  Try to take me out.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  I will.  Thanks, Vicky.  Bye.  All right.  Let's take a break, Anthony.  All righty.  I dug this up from the Opie and Anthony archives,  messing with some chick that thought she won a lot of money through one of those clearing houses.  Oh, yeah.  You know, like Publishers Clearing House.  Or one of those such things like that.  Right.  She thought she was calling that company, but she called us instead.  Have a play of this in a while.  Check it out. 
[172:30]
 Hello?  Yes, I'm calling.  Is it?  Yes, it is.  What could we do for you today?  Yes, I just got a call.  Yes.  And he gave me my claim number.  Uh-huh.  Because I won a prize.  Yes, you did.  What what claim number did you get?  654.  654.  321.  321.  6J.  6J?  Yes.  Ooh.  Pretty excited, are you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You ever won anything before? 
[173:00]
 Never won anything.  Hold on, please.  Oh, okay.  Dude, tell us you want a European vacation.  Hello?  Hello?  That is coming up as a European vacation.  A European vacation?  Yeah.  He had told me something like $10,000.  I wish I were you as a matter of fact because it's a European vacation  for your family plus $10,000 in spending money.  Oh my god.  Oh my god.  Oh my god.  Are you psyched?  Yeah. 
[173:30]
 I'm like, I'm like shaking.  And this is, this is, oh my god.  Wow.  Oh my god.  Wow.  Hold on.  We have our supervisor here.  Okay.  Gonna need, I guess, some information maybe.  Hold on.  Hi, ma'am.  Yes?  Hi, this is John Huber, Bill's supervisor.  Can I have that number once again, please?  We gotta verify that you are in fact the winner.  Yes, it's 654-321-6J.  6J?  Yes.  I thought she said A, John. 
[174:00]
 You thought she, I thought it was an A.  Yes.  It's 6J?  It's 6J as in jump.  We got some good news and bad news.  You're still the winner.  Okay.  But your prize is a set of steak knives.  A set of steak knives?  Yes.  The European vacation for you and your family and the $10,000 spending money is for 6A.  And you'll have to pay for the shipping on the steak knives.  That's $19.95.  Would you like to?  No, thank you. 
[174:30]
 Okay.  That's okay.  That's fine.  Okay.  Well, thank you anyway.  That was way too painful, man.  Poor girl.  I'm all for violence sometimes.  Hey, you guys are a bunch of pussies.  God, I want to punch you in the face.  Better leave a bruise.  1027 WNEW.  I want to sound like the ABC voice guy there.  Yeah, tonight. 
[175:00]
 Tonight on a brand new NYPD Blue.  1027 WNEW.  Dennis Franz's ass in your face.  So Peter Anthony, audience and feedback.  Mark from Highland Lakes, New Jersey.  You want addiction?  We were just talking about gaming.  Yeah.  Mark writes, play EverQuest.  I got laid off because I was absent from work.  I don't give a shit about boffing my wife. 
[175:30]
 I spent all my time playing this game.  It's scary.  I'm on level 47 of 50.  Trust me, you'll give up sex for this game.  Jesus.  Some of these games are so good.  The guy's got it bad.  But some of these games, it's like doing like, you know, crack.  Doing the crack.  It's like doing a line or two back in the 80s.  You can't do just one.  Danny from the Bronx.  You know what I mean though, with these games, you're like,  it's going to put in five minutes before the news. 
[176:00]
 Oh, it's not five minutes.  I'm going to put in five minutes before Letterman.  Then I'm going to go to bed after Letterman.  I never put time constraint.  I always put level constraint.  I'm like, all right, after I get around this corner  and take out the guy, I'll hang it up.  Now what sucks about these games is you're in a really involved level.  OK?  Yeah.  And it takes you a real long time to really figure it out.  You finally figure it out.  And you were saying in your head the whole time,  as soon as I figure out this level, I'm going to bed.  Yeah. 
[176:30]
 I accomplished a mini goal in this game.  I'm going to bed.  Right.  But then all of a sudden, like let's say the exit door opens for that level.  You pop into a whole brand new world.  It's like, oh, I got to explore before I go to bed.  You can't go to bed now.  Just take a quick look around the room.  Take a quick look.  And then you're in it.  Next thing you know, it's 4.35 in the morning.  Exactly.  And you're like, oh, they're terrible.  How did they do this?  How did they do this to us?  It's an addiction.  It really is.  Danny from the Bronx talking about Medal of Honor again says, 
[177:00]
 the best is when you go undercover and the guards give you the Nazi salute.  It's a World War II game.  And you pull out your gun and blow their head right off.  The look on their face when they realize who you are and try to run is priceless.  That brings up something too.  Because we've been playing games for years.  And it used to be the little pixelated two-dimensional animated character  if you had to shoot anything.  That was it.  No blood, no nothing.  It was kind of a ding! 
[177:30]
 And he's out.  You know?  Yeah.  When Miss Pac-Man died, who cared?  Yeah, who cared?  Wacka, wacka.  Rrrr.  Womp, womp.  Right.  But now, I mean the faces have expressions.  You shoot them and the arms fly back.  The body slumps in the corner.  Blood flows out.  In Half-Life, you set a landmine and he trips it.  And it blows up.  You see meat and bone chunks flying past you.  A face.  A face flies past you. 
[178:00]
 Yeah.  It goes on the floor and just a smear.  And if you had a little relationship with that person in the game,  you kind of feel bad.  Now that he's gone.  Yeah.  You kind of do.  Like you could recruit a couple of people in Half-Life.  So you recruit one of the cops,  that are one of the security guards in the plant that you're in.  And he goes, okay, you know, maybe we'll make it if we stick together.  Make it a little longer.  He comes with you.  All of a sudden, a big monster comes out and just hacks into pieces.  You're like, oh, I was kind of getting attached to the little guy. 
[178:30]
 Yeah, he was helping me out.  He was helping me.  He was my pal.  Um, Steve, what do you got?  Hey, Anthony, you got to get this piece of software.  It's called BLEEM and it'll let you play all of Opie's games  on your PC in higher resolution than on the PlayStation.  Yeah, I heard about that.  It works really good.  And if you have like a good accelerator card or a good 3D graphics,  the games look way better than they do on the PlayStation.  Yeah, this guy's dissing me on the instant feedback Opie saying,  oh, I have my 16 meg Voodoo 2 card, Voodoo 3 card. 
[179:00]
 No, pal, I got the 32 meg of Diamond Viper.  All right, pal, you want to start talking hardware?  Tech talk.  I'll kick your ass.  Tech talk.  Thank you, Steve.  All right.  All right.  Hey, Bob.  Yeah, what's up?  Hey, you're the manager of Anthony's old hangout.  I used to be the manager of Time Out in Sunrise Mall.  And I used to remember on Saturday when he mentioned Lunar Lander,  I swear I jumped back 20 years. 
[179:30]
 I said, oh my God, that's the little kid.  Well, not the little kid.  That's the kid in the denim jacket who used to wait for me to open the store.  You and your buddy.  I used to play Lunar Lander for hours.  No, actually, that wasn't me.  Yes, it was.  Well, I never went there.  You never went to Time Out in Sunrise Mall?  No.  That's right.  Oh, man.  I used to play it at the...  And everyone knows...  I don't even remember where.  And everyone knows Ant wasn't wearing denim jackets.  He was wearing fur coats back then.  That's right. 
[180:00]
 Big, fluffy fur coat.  Big difference.  Oh, man.  I'm sure there was other people addicted to that stupid game, too.  I don't know.  That one in Lunar Lander and the other space game where you had to blow everything out of the sky.  Remember Defender?  Defender?  I thought it was called...  I remember Defender.  Arcanoid?  Remember Joust?  Arcanoid.  I remember Arcanoid.  Riding around like an ostrich looking thing.  Joust was the first 50 cent game.  Yeah.  Joust was the first 50 cent game. 
[180:30]
 Absolutely.  Okay.  You guys suck.  Thank you.  Take care, man.  And is that a train?  No, you did well.  Goodbye.  Bye.  A lot of people, you know, a little paranoid of the train.  We didn't have to break out the train too many times today.  No.  People jumping off the track these days.  That's good.  You don't want to be the one that's known to be hit by the train.  No.  Tom, you're next.  Hey.  Hey.  When you mentioned Wondarama before...  Yeah.  ...you brought back a very, very traumatic instance.  I was on it when Bob McAllister was still hosting it. 
[181:00]
 Yeah.  That one was four hours long.  About four hours long.  Oh, you could wake up on Sunday morning at like seven o'clock in the morning  and watch Wondarama until Soul Train came on at like midnight.  Exactly.  At midnight, at noon.  You don't know what they put kids...  This was like scared straight for kids.  They would...  Two things I remember particularly...  Remember the go-go session when they... 
[181:30]
 You know, when the kids were dancing and stuff?  Yeah, they said it was down in the basement.  But it was the same studio.  They just turned the audience the other way?  Exactly.  It was on a big sound stage and they'd move the bleachers where you sat  and they set up the things.  But what they told you was, they told you,  if you don't dance, we're going to make you wait outside for your parents.  And it was probably midway through.  Oh my God!  And I think I was six or eight years old.  That's threatening the children on Metro Media Television. 
[182:00]
 Every stage manager was like Hitler.  Okay?  You were there from probably eight o'clock in the morning  to probably ten o'clock at night.  For a six-year-old kid, that's two days.  The other thing I remember is that when...  You know how they always advertise...  Didn't they give you ice cream and Kraus hot dogs?  Yeah.  What they gave you was they gave you...  Halfway through for lunch, they gave you the Bajumur ice cream sticks,  but only like the half of one. 
[182:30]
 And they gave you an RC Cola.  And the stage manager...  RC Cola, yeah.  The stage manager goes,  Any one of you kids that spilled it, we're going to make you lick it up!  And didn't Bob McAllister go and chain smoke in between shooting?  When he used to do the professor,  when he used to change it to the professor,  I swear to God, it was an hour between some changes.  And he just put his stupid lab coat on and some glasses. 
[183:00]
 Exactly.  It took an hour.  They told you after he came back, after an hour,  and you're just sitting there like, what the heck is going on?  Oh my God, it was torture for God.  You have to start cheering like he just left.  These people scared you never wanted to watch a show again.  Oh, no wonderama.  Oh my God, forget about it.  Does anybody here got an aardvark?  Oh my God.  I'm trying to even think if... 
[183:30]
 I'm sure they must have sexually molested some kids.  Oh my God.  I just can't remember.  Probably was me and I blocked it out.  That was old.  That show was on Metro Media, WNEW Television.  Yep, Channel 5.  Yeah, Channel 5 before they went to Fox.  I swear to God, they're bringing that memory back.  Yeah, wonderama.  Boy, I would love to see some old clips from that damn show.  Oh, God, I'd love to not.  Tom McAllister, what a nut.  He's dead now, you know.  Is he? 
[184:00]
 Yeah, he died.  We did a haunting tribute to him about a year ago, I guess, when he died.  I'm surprised it wasn't some kid that was on the show that probably killed him.  Wow.  He used to smoke like crazy.  Yeah, that's probably why it took him so long to put his lab coat on.  So he died of lung cancer or something.  Yeah.  All right, Tom.  Bye, guys.  Thank you.  Does anybody here got an aardvark?  Let's go down to the basement to the disco, kids. 
[184:30]
 And get the poor kids dancing.  They're all doing the pee-pee dance.  They all look like they got to take a leak.  Little, like, seven-year-old to nine-year-old kids  dancing like they just got to take a whiz from all the RC Cola.  They're all popped up on that.  Hopped up on the junk.  Hopped up on the junk.  Jason, you're next on WNAW.  What's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Um, Anthony.  Yeah?  A couple months ago, you said that Mob Rule was a good computer game.  Yeah.  That thing sucks.  Well, you don't like it? 
[185:00]
 It's horrible.  It all depends on what kind of games you like, man.  Yeah, I got it.  It's like a $50 game, and it sucks.  There's some good, well, that's like one of those strategy games and stuff.  I don't usually play those.  I play first-person shooters.  Yeah.  But for a strategy game, I thought it was pretty good.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm not into that stuff.  And by the way, EverQuest?  Yeah.  One of my friends, he was addicted to that game.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh my god.  It's horrible.  A lot of people are writing on the Instant Feedback about EverQuest.  Yeah.  What kind of game is that? 
[185:30]
 I don't really know.  It's a role-playing game.  Monica from New Jersey on the topic of EverQuest.  Serious guys, people have gone without eating for entire days just to get  that last pixel of experience from EverQuest.  It's known the world over as ever smack.  It is seriously like some sort of crack for like thousands of people.  Try it sometime.  Yeah, it's pretty bad.  And then James writes from Queens, if that guy's too busy playing EverQuest  instead of doing his wife, I'll do his wife.  It's always somebody there to do that. 
[186:00]
 That's right.  And this goes on and on.  EverQuest equals ever crack.  So there you go.  Video games are stupid.  What's next?  Skateboarding?  You're going to start talking about how cool it is to skateboard?  Grow up just a little.  I wish skateboarding is cool.  Let me tell you something.  First of all, I tried skateboarding.  I just never got the hang of that one, unfortunately.  Most of the games being bought for computers aren't being bought by kids.  You know what I mean?  Yeah. 
[186:30]
 It's like adults buying these games.  Well, Jason, thanks.  All right.  OK.  Peace.  See you guys later.  All right.  Dominic.  We can't win no matter what we talk about.  Hey, Jack.  Yeah, guys.  What's up?  How are you?  Good.  I've been homesick listening to you all week.  Oh, that sucks.  You got that damn flu, huh?  Yeah, it's bad.  But listen to this.  I got you guys on and I have the TV going, the TV Guy channel.  You know, it used to be the preview channel.  Yeah, now it's TV Guy.  And they have all these features and things on there.  They had a thing on there. 
[187:00]
 They said Roseanne is going to have a singing career.  Like she learned her lesson with, you know,  the Star Spangled Banner a few years back.  And the talk show.  And this is the best part.  She said kids think that she's cool.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Anyone can have a singing career.  Apparently.  Who the hell was talking about doing a record soon?  Well, whatever.  They all try it.  It doesn't work.  Who's going to run out and buy these?  You know who has a CD?  Orrin Hatch. 
[187:30]
 What?  He does.  He has a CD.  Is it a comedy CD?  I hope not.  Yeah.  But it's songs inspired by Orrin Hatch or something like that.  Oh, brother.  There you go.  All right.  Well, take care of that flu.  All right.  Thanks a lot.  All right, Jack.  By the way, they asked Bob McAllister when he was the professor.  Hope he was Professor Finkelheimer.  Finkelheimer.  I do remember that.  Professor Fingerheimen.  I mean, Finkelheimer.  All right.  Oh, brother. 
[188:00]
 I think we got to take a break, Anthony.  Yes.  And I believe we're ready to play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show today.  Oh, don't forget all the things we talked about today.  Very educational.  Yeah, we did well.  Let me see.  OK.  Also, get a request for Kill the Kitten.  Yeah.  This is what we'll do.  Commercials.  Write into Kill the Kitten from Stephen Lynch.  OK.  And then we'll play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Great.  Give us a call if you got something.  212-757-1027. 
[188:30]
 Opie.  What is it going to take for us to piss you off to the point where you're going to change  the stage?  And that's what I need to know.  Shove it.  Anthony.  Boy, it's sure is easy to be a fag on the show, isn't it?  That's going to be trouble.  Opie and Anthony.  We've just received a PhD in stupidity.  1027.  WNEW.  Opie and Anthony.  I like that.  This is debauchery mania.  I like that.  Prostate exams for everyone.  11127.  WNEW.

 I'll do this one for all the animal lovers since they like gerbil so much.  Uh-oh.  It's a sing-along too, so everybody feel free to join in.  Oh, little bouts of balls.  When the game of life makes you feel like quitting, it helps a lot if you kill a kitten.  Mark my words, because from where I'm sitting, you can't go wrong if you kill a kitten. 
[189:30]
 Look at those balls.  There's no crime that you'll be committing.  I know the law.  You can everybody kill a kitten.  And if you need yarn for that scarf, you're needing your own.  You're needing your own.  You're needing your own.  You're needing your own. 
[190:00]
 You're needing your own.  You're needing your own.  If you need a scarf, you're needing.  You'll get plenty when you kill a kitten.  Feed it turpentine or break its spine.  Crush it with your shoe as long as you kill a kitten. 
[190:30]
 Kill a kitten.  Listen up.  If the one you love isn't quite as smitten, she'll like you better when you kill a kitten.  And I'll quote the Bible, because that's where it's written.  If he loveth Jesus, he must kill a kitten.  Throw him at a train. 
[191:00]
 Make him snort cocaine.  Drown him in a lake.  Bake a kitty cake.  Flush him down the can.  Hit him with your van.  Stick some TNT up his cup of tea.  Do what you must do.  As long as you kill a kitten. 
[191:30]
 Kill a kitten.  Meow.  Kill a kitten.  You've got to kill a kitten for her.  All right.  Kill a kitten.  Killing kittens isn't easy.  And if the thought makes you feel queasy, grab a pitchfork from the shed. 
[192:00]
 And kill a puppy dog instead.  Kill a kitten.  You've got to kill a kitten.  A little furry kitten.  You've got to kill a kitten.  You've got to kill a mother.  Got to kill a son.  You've got to kill a little f***ing tater.  Kill a man.  8-6-7-5-3-0-9. 
[192:30]
 8-6-7-5-3-0-9.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Stephen Lentzer, everyone.  Yeah, you got that right.  Our buddy, our pal, Stephen Lentzer.  God, I haven't heard that in a while.  That's so freaking funny.  All right, and we only have a few minutes left in the show.  It's 1027WNEW.  And it's time to play our favorite game.  Yes. 
[193:00]
 What did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  I learned that cash equals death.  I learned that cash equals death.  Very educational.  We count.  We do all kinds of fun things.  E.J.  What's going on, guys?  I learned that cash equals death.  Yeah, bravo.  That was probably the most important lesson of the day.  We were hoping you guys were going to pick up on that one.  All right, guys.  In the immortal words of Jim Brewer, nice head.  All right, Hama. 
[193:30]
 Dave, what's going on?  What did you learn on the show today?  I learned that Anthony was a human tennis ball thrower, except with meatballs.  You got to give him that.  He was listening.  See, this is the best part of this game.  Some people out there laughing really hard right now.  Other people going, what is he talking about?  Listen to the show.  We don't have time to explain this late in the show.  Very good, Dave.  All right, man. 
[194:00]
 Bye.  Galaxia?  Yeah.  That's really your name?  Yeah, it is.  Cool name.  Thanks.  E.J. took my line that cash equals cash.  I wanted to add to that saying that if you show me the money, I'll give you some honey.  Very good.  Bravo.  Thank you.  Bye.  I'm going to be a little bit of a  monster rather. 
[194:30]
 Now me and all my buddies know who Anthony is, now we can kill him.  Like crazy.  You think so, pal.  Bring it on.  Easily.  I got a whole little network going on at home here.  All these little PC users, we're going to kill you.  Bring it on.  When the Mac gets Half Life, it will be better graphics.  Coming up very soon, Mac will get Half Life.  Oh, please.  Mac.  All right.  Tells me where you stand.  You got to get different mods too. 
[195:00]
 If you like sniper mode, you got to get ice.  Very cool.  You go into custom game, you get that one.  And counter strike, very cool.  All right, Chris.  They're going to be gunning for you, Anthony.  Chico.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  What did you learn on the show?  Antics up habits, drops them publicly, then probably becomes a closet addict.  Opiates to get dressed, that's their sex.  Cash equals cash, and from yesterday, praise the soul and nigga Charlie.  Take it easy, guys.  All right, Chico. 
[195:30]
 He's learning a lot.  I do not have to get dressed after every sex session.  That's really bothering you, isn't it?  Oh, man.  Because you just picture like you're laying there,  in the afterglow of sex, all sweaty and messy.  You got a smile on your face because you felt so good and everything.  And then, oh, I got to get dressed.  I got to get my little clothes back on.  I got to get in my jammies.  Right.  My little jammies back on.  I hate when the listeners... 
[196:00]
 Oh, no, I'm naked.  I hate when they listen when half an ear, because then you're screwed.  For the rest of my career, at ADW, I'll be known as the guy that has to get dressed after sex.  Doesn't matter.  Doesn't matter, right.  The wife will be named Donna.  I'm missing this one.  Anthony.  Hey.  What did you learn on the show today?  I learned that my wife is going to be Donna.  I'm always away from every morning with a Hummer.  Very good.  Look, we weren't listening to the show.  Exactly. 
[196:30]
 How can we forget Donna?  Exactly. Donna is a saint.  Wakes up for a man every single morning with a Hummer.  Who's better than that?  Guys just going, oh, as they drive their cars right now.  Exactly.  Thank you, Anthony.  The best part of waking up is watching Donna suck.  Hey, Tim, what's up?  What's up, man?  That was funny.  That was really funny.  I realized the easiest way to get laid is if my girl is asleep.  Sleep sex.  Yeah, damn right. 
[197:00]
 Good job, Tim.  See you, man.  Bye.  Who else can we get on real fast here?  Let's go to Rick.  Rick, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned the Wanderama, man.  Nightmares of giant peanut butter jars that they give away.  Do you remember that?  I learned that from Mike Fury.  He's a goodie.  You remember that guy?  Vaguely.  Boy, that was some song that he sang.  It was Mike Fury, he's a goodie. 
[197:30]
 It was some superhero crap that he sang.  And there was also a guy that he...  Wait, wait, how did that song go?  He's a goodie.  He's a goodie.  Very funny.  Thank you. Gotta go.  You never get anybody with that.  Thanks, Rick.  Damn, we didn't get anyone today.  Oh no, we got that...  No, she hung up too.  Everyone jumps off the tracks now.  You guys suck.  That's alright, we're working on a new little feature. 
[198:00]
 We gotta keep you people on your effing toes.  Yeah, we gotta do a feature.  We gotta catch you by surprise.  Right.  Bob?  I learned Irish Harry Gorillas get more sex than I do.  Absolutely.  Good job.  I love this when it's out of context.  Context, excuse me.  More than me.  PJ?  Yeah, how you doing?  Good, what did you learn on the show today?  Most of these listeners get more sex asleep than I do awake. 
[198:30]
 And I'm still looking.  I can't find a copy of Nigger Charlie anywhere.  Supposedly someone's sending us one.  We're gonna have a screening.  We're gonna have a screening of  The Legend of Nigger Charlie.  One more thing, Opie, I work with your ex-girlfriend's sister.  Ex-girlfriend's sister?  Yeah, from Long Island.  I don't know if I should give the last name.  No, don't give the last name.  I don't know her first name. I know her sister's name.  What does she look like?  The sister looks... 
[199:00]
 Oh boy, the sister might be listening now.  Does she look like a troll?  Not quite like a troll, but  it's from a couple years ago.  The last name begins with an A.  No clue.  Did she look like Ellen Barkin?  No.  Well then she wasn't a girlfriend.  She was just like one of those pickups.  Oh, you see how they pass your name off?  They make it sound like they knew you.  Alright, thanks, DJ.  Alright, take it easy.  I swear. 
[199:30]
 Out of sh... what?  Eric!  Eric!  Eric!  You're on the air. What did you learn, man?  I learned that you guys are  two out of shape bastards.  You play too many computer games.  Love ya. Bye.  We're not out of shape?  No.  We can't go to line 11.  What the hell is that all about, Spaz? Come on.  Even Anna knew when she hung up. 
[200:00]
 I'm trolling, I'm trying, I'm trying.  Oh, okay, this one's pretty good.  Frank!  You could be the last call of the day. What did you learn on the show today?  I learned that Rosie Perez listens to the show.  Yeah.  Alright, take care.  And don't confuse her for being a black lady.  Oh yeah, definitely.  Alright, Frank.  Alright, with that, let's get the hell out of here, huh?  Don't forget the Tuesday Night Hummer Club. 
[200:30]
