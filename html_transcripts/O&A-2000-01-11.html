<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a comedic song about sexual activity in a Hummer, setting a tone of raunchy humor that persisted throughout the show.  This segued into a discussion about a massive box of pornography tapes sent by listeners,  including homemade tapes described as disturbing.  The hosts detailed their plans to use some as contest prizes and debated the legal ramifications of their substantial porn collection. A caller offered advice on legal compliance, suggesting they diversify their collection with Kung Fu and Disney movies.  The conversation then shifted to a critical Daily News article and The Rock's walkout from a previous show due to offensive content on a guest's wrestling website.  Opie and Anthony vehemently denied staging any segments, using The Rock's departure as an example. A lengthy debate followed regarding the authenticity of a previous hypnotism segment featuring on-air personalities Rick and Spaz, with callers and guests offering conflicting viewpoints and “evidence.” The segment concluded with a heated exchange between the hosts and an angry caller who accused them of racism, sparking a discussion about race, prejudice, and sensitivity.  The show frequently employed profanity and discussed sexually explicit material.


A subsequent segment featured a phone call with Julie, a caller whose voice the hosts initially misidentified as belonging to a Black woman.  This sparked a discussion about racial stereotypes in vocal patterns and accents, with Julie clarifying she was Hispanic.  Further calls explored racial and ethnic stereotypes in speech.  The conversation then veered towards the hosts' day trading on E-Trade, their trading strategies, and anecdotes about their experiences. The hosts then speculated on Donald Trump's breakup with a supermodel.  Numerous listener calls followed, covering topics such as the hosts' previous Super Bowl party, racial stereotypes and jokes, and suggestions for future show segments, including an “eight-man fight club elimination tournament” and a “boob weight lifting” segment.  Callers Keith, Joe, Walter, Mike, Jimmy, and Bob, along with several others, participated in the discussion. The segment concluded with news about the New York Jets sale and a discussion about Sylvester Stallone, fueled by a story from a book written by former Hollywood prostitutes.


The show then moved to a segment on "sleep sex," sparked by a brief discussion of Angie Everhart's appearance.  The hosts delved into a *Fine Magazine* article detailing the phenomenon, including expert opinions on "confusional arousal."  Numerous callers shared their experiences, ranging from humorous anecdotes to more explicit accounts. These accounts included a man who filmed and joined in his sleeping fiancée's self-pleasuring, a woman who enjoyed her sleep-deprived boyfriend's aggression, another who feigned sleep for more adventurous sex, and a caller who recounted a public wet dream in a hospital waiting room.  One caller described a dream involving Captain Stubing morphing into her cat.  Another caller discussed a compulsive need to wear socks to bed, even after sex, and a bandmate urinating on a wall while asleep.  A Comedy Central PA caller promoted the Upright Citizens Brigade and their infamous dildo prank on the Today Show. The segment continued with more sleep sex stories, including a woman who unknowingly pleasured herself while dreaming of satisfying her husband. The segment also included music breaks and a brief discussion about video games.


The final segment focused on video games, with the hosts and callers discussing various PC and Playstation games, including *Siphon Filter*, *Hidden & Dangerous*, *Half-Life*, *Half-Life 2*, *Medal of Honor*, *Silent Hill*, *Tribes*, *Unreal Tournament*, *Team Fortress*, *Opposing Force*, *EverQuest*, and older arcade games like *Lunar Lander*.  Callers shared personal gaming anecdotes, including one laid off due to excessive *EverQuest* playtime. The hosts discussed the evolution of video game graphics and the addictive nature of gaming, drawing comparisons to substance abuse.  A caller mistakenly believed she won a sweepstakes, and the hosts played a game called "What Did We Learn Today?" with callers offering humorous summaries of the show.  Stephen Lynch's "Kill the Kitten" was played.  The segment also included calls about PC gaming technical aspects and a brief discussion of Roseanne's potential singing career and a caller’s encounter with Bob McAllister on *Wonderama*. The segment concluded with a promotion for the hosts' “Tuesday Night Hummer Club”.

[00:11:30]  Opie and Anthony  1027 WNEW  1027 WNEW  It's the Opie and Anthony show  Hey, man  Should give out our phone numbers  212-757-1027  If you have anything for the program  Our fax line is working just fine  212-957-9639  We like hearing from you guys  If you're being inducted into the Tuesday Night Hummer Club for the first time 
[00:12:00]  Yes  And if you are, congratulations  Well, the Daily News  Oh, I got one  Can a week go by without the papers writing something stupid about the radio show, Anthony?  Hey, that's a good thing  We don't care  Now, honestly, we don't care  But I'd like to point out the stupidity of some of these articles  Yeah  David Hinkley, who I actually kind of respect  I don't think he really gets or likes our show 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, well, I think he's very skeptical  You know?  He's very skeptical as to what goes on in this show  What is real  Right  But the thing is, everything's real  Honestly, everything is real on this show  We don't fake anything  Can you honestly think of one thing we faked?  No  If a listener could come up with that, I'd appreciate hearing that  Because I can't think of one thing we have done since moving to New York that has been fake 
[00:13:00]  That we faked  That was a put-on  For the sake of good radio  Yeah  Pretty much what you hear is what happens  And I'm surprised David Hinkley, who writes the radio column for the Daily News, hasn't figured that out yet  Well, you can't really blame David  I'm going to take the blame off him and put it on the wacky DJs  Because he's not used to reality in radio  Reality-based radio  Right  If something happens, if something's big, if something makes some noise in this town 
[00:13:30]  It was probably a set-up or fake, you know?  He's not used to things really happening  Like what happened here, The Rock came in, got upset, and walked out on the show  Correct  Well, in the radio dial section of the Daily News  David Hinkley writes  The Rock  Many listeners found it riveting when WWF wrestler The Rock walked off the Opie and Anthony show on WWE  Thursday after the arrival of Sick Boy, whose wrestling website includes posts with racial insults 
[00:14:00]  Racism in entertainment and on the web?  Question mark?  Good subject  Except that the WWF is a set-up and so is a lot of Opie and Anthony  God damn does that piss me off  What's wrong with him?  If he's going to say that, why doesn't he list like a bunch of things that we have done?  On the show that he is convinced is a set-up  Name one thing we've done that is a set-up  Yeah, go ahead, David  Come on  If you're going to make a statement like that, then give me an example  Something I can touch and feel and go, oh, I remember that 
[00:14:30]  And then we would explain to you why it wasn't a set-up  Except that the WWF is a set-up and so is a lot  A lot of Opie and Anthony  A lot would mean a lot  Pretty much everything we do  Yeah  Someday people will get what we do  Remember the time we walked off the show in the summer?  People thought that was a set-up  Like, why would they risk their jobs?  Yeah, that was fake  Because we really believed in what we were doing that day  And we were that pissed that we were willing to, like, get fired 
[00:15:00]  Yeah  But they're like, oh, that was just a publicity stunt  A fake  To get listeners and stuff  No one ever believes us  It's a running gag for regulars to laugh at rubes who get all outraged as if it's real  What?  Ah  That's not true either  However sincere an act, then  However legit an issue  You're still in a room where the first commandment is 
[00:15:30]  Take nothing seriously  Well, that makes sense  Oh, sure  We don't try to, you know, take anything seriously on the show  He's like, we're a goof  The Rock's a goof  So, like, what is he getting all serious with his racist issue  On a goof show  When he's a goof show  Right  All right, that I can understand what he's saying  See, I guess the thing to say at this time is  What happened last Thursday with The Rock and Ant and I  Was very, very, very uncomfortable and very real 
[00:16:00]  And to be honest with you  That type of radio is not going to happen on our show very often  No  We're against that uncomfortable and that real  Where we pretty much, I don't know, break out of our radio persona, if you will  To really try to discuss something  Yeah  And then, you know, the crybaby, the croc  You know, walks  Corky Rock  Walks out of our show  Racist  Walks out of our show after I told him, you know, we had nothing, nothing to do 
[00:16:30]  With the comments on Sick Boy's wrestling site  Yeah  And still The Rock walked out without saying goodbye  Dwayne  Dwayne  Dwayne Johnson without discussing it further  He's a crybaby  I'm sure Sick Boy was happy, though  See his little name in the paper there  And it's all in bold type, like The Rocks  Yep  That's pretty cool  Well, The Rock is even thicker print than Sick Boy, but  The Rock says 
[00:17:00]  I'm a crybaby  Hypnotizing with stage  That, okay  Dave  How you doing, guys?  Alright  I'm not saying the hypnotizing was stage, but I do  I can give you some idea as to why someone would think it was stage  Okay  He had Spaz hypnotized, right?  Correct  And every time he said something or did something  Spaz was supposed to act like a farm animal  Right  Yeah  And he didn't say, or he was supposed to 
[00:17:30]  He was supposed to make a different farm animal noise  Okay  Is it just a coincidence that every time he did something  Spaz did a different farm animal noise?  Like, he never repeated the same farm animal  Yeah  He would always go into a different  It was like he was searching  And towards the end  It was like he was trying to think of a different farm animal  Right, you're right  You know something?  But, Dave  I don't believe the hypnotizing thing  Oh, okay  I don't believe it either  Oh, okay  I really  I totally did not believe it 
[00:18:00]  I'm still extremely skeptical  I was being courteous and cordial to the hypnotist when he was here  But I don't buy it  I don't believe it  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait  Kazan and I are on the opposite sides of the fences on this one  Yeah  I completely believed it  But I also decided I have to ask Rick a ton of questions  I asked Rick enough questions  As far as enough questions after the fact  That I'm convinced what happened is happening  I'm still not  So you think Rick and Spaz pulled one over on us 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, they would just like to believe maybe  Rick was believable  Rick was believable  But Spaz  It was just too  It was like  It was too perfect  You know what I'm saying?  Right  Why would he do  Every time he had to do a farm animal noise  He came up with a different farm animal  He was truly hypnotized  And the hypnotist didn't say anything  That he had to make a different farm animal noise every time  I think just  I think just  I basically think Spaz blew it 
[00:19:00]  And I can see where a guy like David Hinckley  Is going to listen to that skit  And say, alright, that was staged  Right  Because no one's going to expect Spaz to come up with it on his own  If that was  They're going to think that you're supposed to do it  If that was staged  And I weren't even in on it  And that's what  There's no way it was staged  In my opinion  No way  I believe that you believe that  Oh yeah  Without a doubt  Because I asked Rick enough  I even said, Rick, we're not on the air anymore  I mean, that was pretty freaky  What was going on there with the hypnotist  And he goes, dude, I swear 
[00:19:30]  I barely remember  You know, being in the studio  Doing all that crazy stuff  Yeah, but Spaz swears up and down to things all the time  Well, I mean, Spaz  I believe Rick  I don't believe Rick would lie  But Spaz is full of it  Well, Spaz is not a good liar either, though  He's not a good liar  I didn't say he was a good liar  Get Spaz real fast  I said he's a liar  Right  But the fact is  We don't stage stuff on this show  I wasn't buying it, though  Uh, Spaz  That's not really  No, you're right  That's not  Yeah, that isn't setting up 
[00:20:00]  Something up for the skit  Which I don't think there's anything wrong with it  And even if you do stage stuff  It's making people laugh  Who cares?  Your job is to make people laugh  Well, there's an integrity  I mean, believe it or not  An Opie and Anthony integrity  We don't like, like, faking and staging stuff  There's a lot of radio shows that do do that  Oh, Spaz is half everything  And it should be obvious to you guys  When you're listening to the radio  What is staged and what is real  And I'm telling you right now  I'm challenging you guys today  To come up with something that  You are convinced we staged 
[00:20:30]  Or, you know  Or it was fake or something  You're not going to find one  I think the Spaz  Hypnotistic  I don't think  Spaz  A lot of people still think  Within such a deep hypnosis  All right  Well, Dave  We got Spaz in the studio  All right  A lot of people, Spaz  Still think that  You know, you faked that whole thing  When you were hypnotized  And you were in cahoots  With the hypnotist  And you and Rick  Were in cahoots  With the hypnotist  No way that was possible  And if you would listen back  When we replay it 
[00:21:00]  From time to time  And I look back at the video  He says  When he tells me  To do the barnyard animals  To switch it up a bit  And don't do the same ones  So looking at the video  And I saw him say this  Yeah, but then you should  Then you should have been able  To just really fast  Rattle off  Different barn animals  It sounded to me  And to Dave  Like you were trying  To  Like you were thinking  Of a new one  Trying to think  Like as he was talking  You're going  Okay, now I'm going to need  A new farm animal  In my head  And then he would 
[00:21:30]  Just say something  And you would  Go into the farm animal  I don't remember  Doing that at all  And I think what has to happen  Is you've got to get hypnotized  No, it wouldn't work  It's not going to work  You know  I think when you're  Under hypnosis  You still have to think  And let me tell you something  It would piss off  The friggin' hypnotist  I know that  You know how the hypnotists are  They come to the radio shows  They want subjects  That will work  That they can work with  That it will be fun  To listen to  And make people  Go to their shows  Yeah, they usually  You see those people 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, picture me  Going into the back here  He hypnotizes me  Nothing happens  I walk out  I'm fine  He knows it  He sees it in my face  Like, I'm not going to play along  And he goes  Oh, it didn't take on him  Well, he did explain that  There's a trust factor  You have to believe  Because you have to like  You know  You have to like  Close your eyes  And really concentrate  On what he's doing  I would do everything he said  And you know something  It still wouldn't work  I'm not going to go  Quack, quack, quack  I don't see how  It possibly happens  Not to the extent 
[00:22:30]  That that guy was doing it  There is a percentage of people  That it just doesn't work on it  Did they get the voodoo in you?  I mean  I believe it  I don't understand  How it goes down  But I believe it  These guys are so  Friggin' powerful  That in  A few minutes  Of being alone  With somebody  It was like  A half hour to 40 minutes  They can totally  Take over  Their friggin' mind  How about  Why  Aren't there more criminals  That are hypnotists  That hypnotize people  That are maybe 
[00:23:00]  Bank tellers  And put a subliminal  Thought in their head  When I go in the bank  You're just going to  Give me a big bag of cash  Then how else  Do you explain  What we saw with Rick  It's a gimmick  It's not a gimmick  I ask Rick  I go man  You know  I'm like Rick  Tell me  You know why  Is this fake  Are you in coach  With a guy  He swore to me  He didn't even remember  Acting like a three year old  Trying to grab a quarter  Out of my pocket  He was having fun  He was being involved  With the show  He was being  A part of the show 
[00:23:30]  I will not accept that  A certain percentage  Of these people  That get up on stage  At these shows  And do things  With the hypnotists  They will play along  That's what the hypnotist knows  Rick  They're exhibitionists  Right  Right  They want to be  Why do you think  We get people  That come in  Or come up on stage  At our live shows  And do anything  Because they want to be  Part of the show  So Rick doesn't need  To be part of the show  That bad  He loves being part of the show  You can't keep his mouth shut  When he's in front  Of the friggin mic  Jesus Christ  Unfortunately we can't  Get Rick on  Because he's in London 
[00:24:00]  But I'm telling you  Rick would have told us  By now  If he was in cahoots  With the guy  Dude maybe he actually  Wants to  You've got to believe  That much  Maybe he wants to  No no no  Wait a minute  I don't believe  Rick would tell you  I don't either  Here's why  Here's why  Listen to the logic  Okay  Rick is truly dedicated  To the show  He bends over backwards  For the show  Okay  If he tells you  That he was in cahoots  With the guy  That makes for better radio  And that's why  And Rick would fess up  And go  Alright guys  I conned you  It would make for better radio  If that's all we're worried about 
[00:24:30]  I'm telling you  I think he'd take it  To his graves  That the guys  Can continue to believe  That you guys can keep  Nah  Because a lot of the bits  That do work for this radio show  Is like  You know  Bits that go wrong  Or you know  Go off the track  First of all  He came out from the back room  Looking like he was on heroin  It wasn't even like  Hypnotized  That was scary  He was acting  Opie  He was acting  No  No  No  You know something  He came out looking like  He was on heroin  His arm  His arm was shaking 
[00:25:00]  His like  His eyes were  Half masked  His mouth was open  He looked like he was ready  To start drooling  Because that was how  He thought  We would want to see  Someone that is hypnotized  From like years  Of watching cartoon  You know what  If that's the case  Then Rick should move to Hollywood  Because he's a great actor  He's a great actor  Because I'm telling you  The stuff I saw  When the camera  Or no one was focusing  On him  He was still  Hypnotized as a three year old  Staring at a quarter  And he was freaking creepy  Why aren't there more 
[00:25:30]  Hypnotist criminals  It seems so friggin easy  If you walk into anywhere  You hypnotize someone  They give you what they want  Hypnotist  How could you do shows  How could you find time  To do hypnotism shows  If you're a hypnotist  When you could be  Getting laid 24 hours a day  You go to a bar  You see the gorgeous  Looking girl  You hypnotize  And before you know it  Wah wah wah  So it's Tuesday every day  So you think all those shows  Are staged  And everyone on stage  Is acting  And they're really good at it 
[00:26:00]  Absolutely  No way  I think there is  Legitimate hypnotism  And I think it takes  A long time  Of laying down  Relaxing  For things like  Maybe to quit smoking  To cut down on eating  Right  But that's something  Or remembering something  From the past  Right  Something that's in your mind  You can't make  A sane human being  With a half hour  Of coaching in a room  Act like a chicken  It was just  The people that really  Legitimately do that  They're not going 
[00:26:30]  On radio shows  Not that there's anything  Wrong with that  But those are  You know psychiatrists  It was  Right  You have to be responsible  You've got the power  Of someone's mind  You can't just go around  But also the hypnotist  The hypnotist also  Has to find things  You would  You would probably do  If you weren't hypnotized  I mean if all of a sudden  You told Rick  You know under hypnosis  To have gay sex  I don't think  He's going to do that  I think that's part  Of it as well  I mean the hypnotist  Finds things that  You know  This person  Would normally do 
[00:27:00]  Oh and Spaz  Is a prostitute  And going to get me  To give him money  For sexual favors  You know something  That  No I'm not biased  That freaked you out  It freaked me out  Because if he was  Even kidding around  No no  Yeah  Without any hypnotism  Involved  If like a guy  Is just kidding around  With you like that  It freaks me out  I guarantee  Spaz come here  I'll prove it to you  Spaz  Anthony reach for  Oh he's groin 
[00:27:30]  Yeah watch him freak out  Go over here  Grab that mic  Alright  Remember when you were  Hypnotized after you  Saw the tape  And you  You found  You discovered  That you were like  A prostitute  And you were  Flirting with Ant  That freaked me out  Okay  Try to do that right now  He's not  See  It ain't gonna happen  He's not gonna do it  Because it's not part  Of the act  It's part of the show  Look at him  There's no way  He could even  Attempt to do it now  Try to act like  Try to act like  A prostitute  And he's your best 
[00:28:00]  Customer right now  Go ahead  See  I couldn't even  Dream of doing that  But under  No hypnosis  Whatsoever  He played a gay guy  Getting his  Schwanz  Done up by another  Man  On a stage  Because what  That was acting out  Oh it was an act  See  But you can't act now  Alright act now  Because he's not  Under hypnosis  He wasn't under hypnosis  At his gay play  Alright  And he acted like  A fag  Act like a prostitute  And answer best customer  I can't  What would you do  What would you do  See right now  He's bolstering  His hypnotism act 
[00:28:30]  By making like  He couldn't do that  Dave you are  100% right  Give Dave a friggin prize  No way  Dave go on hold  We'll give you something  No  I like you  You're wise  Let me plug my website  What's your website  Real fast  Worldsgreatestparty.com  Alright thanks  Bye man  Thanks dude  I agree with Dave  We will agree to disagree  There's no way  I completely believe  What I saw  Was because of  The guys under hypnosis  Without a doubt 
[00:29:00]  Without a doubt  In my mind  You saw Spaz's face  There's no way  He could act that out  With you  If he wasn't under hypnosis  He acted with another man  In a play  Without hypnosis  He's able to do it  He is totally able  To do it  And I know  He's got a  And I know Rick  Well enough  Off mic  Off the radio show  You know  What I saw  When he was acting  Like a three year old  Is just  For the show  No way  For the show  Listen  See  When I was hypnosis  I was having hypnosis 
[00:29:30]  So that's  Okay  Through the back of my mind  I could do it  Because I've acted  In that sort of thing  Because I've sat down  In acting  You sit down  For like three months  Right  To sit down  And plan it  So it  Because I've been  In a gay place  So to speak  It was in the back  Of my mind  So hypnosis  I guess he was able  To induce that part  I don't know  Of memory  Spaz  I ain't buying it  You can talk  To your blue in the face  I am not buying it  So why  They have nothing  To hide at this point  We already got  What we got  Out of the radio show  Now it would make 
[00:30:00]  It would make a great bit  If he  I would  If it was fake  It would be great  If they admitted it now  Because it would be  Unbelievable radio  He won't  First of all  Because you believe it so much  And if you tell Spaz  The sky is green  He'll tell you it's green  It's not how our show works  It's not how our show works  They would have told us by now  You stop short in the halls  Fast enough  And he's doing a prostate exam  On you  It's not how the show works  Man  I understand  For some reason  For some reason  They're still holding out on us 
[00:30:30]  They don't want to  Come forward and say  That alright  They were putting it on  You're high  I am not high  You're high  I'm completely sober  Do you pay attention  To the people we work with  Yeah  And you're still convinced  They're just pulling one over  On us  Two months later  Yes  Why  Why would they  I'll get it out of Rick  In the office one day  I'll get it out of him  Dude I tried on many occasions  You believe it too much  I  I'll sit there  I'll sit there and go  Rick  It's not just believing  Because I do believe it  But I also decide  You know  I want to do some research  And find out some stuff 
[00:31:00]  The guy would not budge  He wouldn't budge in the office  He wouldn't budge on the train  On the way home  He wouldn't budge at a family function  I've asked him three or four different times  He is not going to budge  Yet everything's completely fine now  But he has no problem admitting  That he got gay crabs  And he sucks on chocolate penises  What's the difference  Because that's for the show  No way  Why  Because he would get more air time  If he admitted it  Because then we would come in here  And trash him  And go  Why are you faking stuff for the show  He will  He never will  I'll get him to admit it  No way 
[00:31:30]  Guaranteed  No way  Then how could you just  Trot through the rest of your life  Knowing that at some point  That some guy  Made your mind  Friggin wacko  That's why I wouldn't go under it  Because I believe it so much  And I wouldn't want that experience  Rick was truly freaked out  I saw it in his eyes  The guy was freaked out  That he was doing the things  He was doing  Especially when he was acting  Like he was three years old  Trying to get a goddamn quarter  From my pocket  Next time they could hypnotize  The both of us  I don't want to  And watch you  Quack around like a chicken  And watch me go 
[00:32:00]  This is like a bull  I don't want to  Alright  It freaks me out  I do believe it  I do believe it  You have the type of personality  And I think I have the type of personality  That we probably wouldn't go under  There's a bunch of people  That don't go under  There's no under  Because there has to be  A trust level  When you decide to go under hypnosis  There is no under  I'm totally saying  There is no under  I don't believe it  For a second  I didn't want the guy  Getting all pissed off  That his shows wouldn't sell 
[00:32:30]  If I was  See then you're a plus  You should have like  Confronted him  Next hypnotist I will  You live and learn on this show  He's coming back  Alright  And I'll tell him  I absolutely don't believe you  That's a plus move man  Okay I agree  But you live and learn on this show  That's how it is  If you didn't believe that much  Then you should have  Confronted the guy  Billy from Air Seek  Billy from Air Seek Productions  What's up Billy  Hey Anthony  You're missing a big point here buddy  What?  The fact that you said before  That you would expect  Spass to start rattling off 
[00:33:00]  All these animal noises  One by one  Being under hypnosis  Does not make a guy smarter  No  No I'm not saying that  Because if you listen to the tape  He did duplicate a few of them  And it sounded like  It sounded like  He was really searching  For the farm animals  Oh I understand  It's still going to be  Spass  You know something  It's still in brain  It doesn't even matter  To nitpick like this  About one little  Part of it  Because I don't believe any of it  Hey guys look  I've been under hypnosis  For years  For losing weight  Look how good it's worked  You're not helping my cause 
[00:33:30]  Billy  I actually am  Hold on  One thing I actually am  I mean this whole  This Hinkley guy  Yeah  What an idiot  I mean nothing nothing  But here's a guy  Who if he knows so much  Why does this column  Get cut back to one day a week  Yeah  Because it's boring as hell  You want to know  The other big story  In the radio column today  Since I got it here  WPLJ rolls through  Top 100 rock songs  If you always wanted to like rock  But didn't have the attention span  PLJ can solve your problems 
[00:34:00]  Scott and Todd yesterday  Broke out a mix of excerpts  From the whole top 100  In VH1's greatest rock songs  It took 10 hours to make  And runs 4 minutes and 23 seconds  From Papa was a rolling stone  At number 100  To satisfaction at number 1  It's 4 minutes 23 seconds  Of just like  It's just freaking  Clips of the top 100 songs  That appeared on VH1  Who cares  And he's writing about it  And he's writing about that  That's the headline grabber 
[00:34:30]  Of his column  And if I was Scott and Todd  If that's all David Hinkley  You know has  To write about your show  I'd be pretty damn embarrassed  At this point  Yeah  Yeesh  And you guys  And Scott and Todd  Didn't even do it  They had one of their flunkies  Do it  And then they play it  And get all the credit for it  Oh  Wow  Would you sit through that ant?  Oh yeah  Yeah  Would you spend  10 hours  To get a snippet  Of the top 100 
[00:35:00]  Greatest rock and roll songs  According to VH1  10 hours to get  4 and a half minutes  Of material  Oh yeah  10 hours  That's smart  That's great  Really can't figure  Why Stern's kicking your ass  That's weird  Bits like that  In fake news  I thought you guys  Would be number one  KJ Queens  Love the show  But I'm pretty convinced  That is that a train bit  Was staged  What? 
[00:35:30]  What?  How could that  How could  Oh  You're a jackass  Tim what's up?  What's up?  Alright  I just want to say  On Anthony's behalf  Alright  That Opie  Everybody always says  That Spaz  Is always kissing your ass  It sounds like  Maybe you guys  Are teaming up  And it's all BS  That's what?  Anthony's right  There is no hypnosis  It's all BS  Whatever  I completely believe it  And Rick doesn't  Kiss my ass  We have fights  All the time  We're like brothers  Yeah  Spaz kisses your ass 
[00:36:00]  He kicks your ass  Nah  He hasn't kicked my ass  Buddy boy  Hey  He does  I heard it on the radio  No he didn't  Yeah  The fight club  When you met  Talked about his sister  Yeah that's true  He did kick your ass  Oh you said Rick?  Yeah  Oh I thought  He said Spaz  I apologize  You can take Spaz's ass  Yeah I apologize  I didn't hear you right  I feel I am the ultimate skeptic  Which is very good for this show  We can't be getting the wool  Pulled over our eyes  I don't believe in hypnotism  I don't believe in  Friggin Bigfoot 
[00:36:30]  The Loch Ness Monster  UFOs  Nothing  Dave what's up?  Everything's bull crap  Dave  Yeah this is  Anthony's full of it  Because when he was there  And Rick was cursing up a storm  He's like  Oh I believe  I believe  He's full of it  And my wife got hypnotized  Over at Governors  And at the end of the whole thing  He told him  Everything you did  You're going to remember  And there's no way  Unless that guy gave her  Millions of dollars  That she would have done  The stuff that she did  And have you asked 
[00:37:00]  And of course nobody else  Believes in the Loch Ness Monster  And what's the matter with you  She was trying  I think  She was just  She wanted to be part of a show  So now you think  Wait wait wait wait wait  So now you think  This guy's wife  Is lying to this guy  I'm sure the guys asked her  Was that real  Are you in the woods  With the hypnotist  That other guy Dave's a mess  Because the hypnotist  Told him to make  Different animal noises  Every time you make  Every time I snap my finger  You're going to make  A different animal noise  And he did  Well he tried  He's just too stupid  To figure out  Remember he thought  The dog was a farm animal 
[00:37:30]  I don't think  You're getting my point  It's not that I think  Everyone that acts  Like they're hypnotized  On a stage  Is in cahoots  With the hypnotist  I think they're  Just themselves  Wanting to be part of a show  And then they want  Everyone to actually believe  That they were hypnotized  So they don't say anything  So why aren't more people  What do they have  What do they get from it  They get their little  Part of being  Part of a show  They get on stage  They're the center of attention  Everyone loves that 
[00:38:00]  And then they have to  Shut their mouths  For the rest of their lives  And then they don't say anything  I'm sure some people do  Not when you get them on tape  You guys got that delay there  I've been listening to that  Yeah watch that curse  Yeah  That's for sure  My wife didn't fake anything  He told them  He told them when they were done  You're going to remember  Everything you did  Right  She still doesn't remember  Everything she did  All right man  All right  Thank you  I would think there would be  A lot more hypnotist criminals  Out there  Steve  Yes  From the underground website 
[00:38:30]  Absolutely  Our screen's not working today  What's up Steve  Not much  But just to reiterate  The same point 150 times  Were you not there  Did you not  I mean I have this all on videotape  You rearing back in pain  When Spaz came at you  Like a little girl  Oh I know  But he was acting  No he wasn't acting  This was hypnotist  I don't buy it  He was hypnotized  There's no way to explain it  Totally not buying it  Well I mean look  When Rick wasn't even on camera 
[00:39:00]  And I pan over to him  And he's in the corner  Curled up  Playing with a quarter  Yeah  No one was paying attention to him  Like there was a section that  You know Rick was by himself  For a good 10 minutes  While we were paying attention to Spaz  That was what he thought  He should do  To make it look good  There's some degree of willingness  That goes along with hypnotism  I mean you have to be willing to do it  Remember the two other girls  That were there  And it didn't work on them  Right  Because there has to be a trust factor  You have to trust  What the guy's going to do to you  So Rick could be turned  Into a blithering 
[00:39:30]  Frigging idiot  Two year old  On the floor  Just from talking to a guy  For a couple of minutes  Get out of here  You are totally understating  The law of the human mind  And personality  Then call me stupid  I believe it  If you go and get hypnotized  Then drag another frigging  Quack hypnotist in here  To try to hypnotize me  I will more than willingly  I will go into the room  Sit there  You'll never be hypnotized  I will do everything he says 
[00:40:00]  And you know what  I'll come out and go  Bull crap  If you prance around  Like a little girl  I'll be there to get it on video  See I  All I have to go on  Is I know Rick pretty well  Outside the show  I asked him  He told me the truth  He has no freaking clue  That's all I need to know  I believe that  I believe it  As much as I would ask you something  You tell me the truth right  Yeah  Thank you  That's all I need to know  And the fact that Rick  Cursed up a storm  And you guys had to make the guy 
[00:40:30]  You know  Tell him to stop  He knew we had to lie  Well  He knew  He knew  Steve was in studio too  It was a freaky scene man  I don't know  I buy it  I buy it  I'm buying it  Alright  Steve a couple other things  Because we could be on this all day  Yeah  First of all  The unofficial  Open Anthony website  Foundrymusic.com  Oh yes  Heading toward a million hits  It's going to happen before Friday  Yeah  Thank you  And the site's only been up what  Seven months  Seven months

[00:42:00]  Talking about the WWF  I thought it would be courtesy  They call us back to discuss this issue  Yeah  A ton of free advertising for their product  Not that they need it  But you know what I'm saying  I want people  Because we were made to look bad  To see the part where we  The show  The rock segment ended  Ant and I went to commercials  And he got up  And left without saying goodbye  That's what I need people to see  Okay  And I hope you have that on video  Oh that  Absolutely I have  Alright  Because the uncomfortable moment  I mean you can put that on as well 
[00:42:30]  But I mean  It's very important to me  That our faithful listeners see  How much of a crybaby this guy was  So the rock just walked out  The guy walking out  Not even saying thank you  For the 50 minutes of promotion  We gave his book signing  And his book  Before he decided to  You know  Blindside us  You know  Someone brought up  A really good point  The other day to me  And they said  As I was rolling the tape for them  They said  You know  One day I wish I could be black  So that I could get really indignant 
[00:43:00]  At the drop of a hat  Yeah  For stupid reasons  Wow  You know  That'll stir up some crap  Hey Steve  Huh  Yeah I know  Well you know something man  If this guy  Has been as racially insensitive  As Opie was saying  As he was the other day  Yeah  In the past  And he got that freaked out about it  That he had to storm out like a baby  Right  Either it was an act  And it was staged  Or he's a hypocrite  And you know 
[00:43:30]  Doesn't deserve half the publicity  You guys gave him  Right  I think he was trying to get publicity  Well get the clip on the unofficial website  ASAP  Alright  If you can find it  And email us when it's up there  So we can tell everybody  I'm serious  I want people to see it  Alright  Alright  Because it's amazing  You're not going to believe  He just  After promoting him for 50 minutes  He like  We go to commercials  I turn around  To you know  Say thanks  Or something to him  And he's getting up  And walking out  With his back turned on  Yeah  Like a big crybaby  The croc  Croc

[00:49:30]  You're black  First of all  You're a hypocrite  Because you started  This conversation  Saying  You know  I would  I would like to see  This guy walk around  The streets  In black skin  For a week  To see how it is  To be black  So how do you know  How it is to be black  You don't  You don't have a clue  How could a white person  Already have a race  You know what  Another race feels like  Including you  Including me  You're right  Including me  So why  You don't know  The oppression  Of being a privileged  White person  Julie you really  Want to get into this  You're prejudging 
[00:50:00]  You know  And assuming  What black people feel  You don't know  How black people feel  If you're Hispanic  You idiot  I'm not an idiot  Okay  I'm not prejudging  I'm just saying that  How could everyone  Walk around saying  This particular race  Is this most sensitive race  When you don't know  What it is  To walk in their shoes  You don't know  How it is  To walk in black people's shoes  Either  Now do you  I'm a minority  In this country  And I know  It's to be prejudged  That's what I'm trying  To tell you  You're not a minority 
[00:50:30]  In this city  I'll tell you  Who's a minority  In this city  Me  Opie  I live in this city  I could live  In Long Island  I could be living  On Long Island  How do you know  I'm living in this city  That's a croc  That's a croc  Of crap  I'll tell you  Who the minority  In this city is  It's whitey man  Have you been  On the subway lately  Excuse me  I look around  Every morning  I'm the only  White guy  Well then  Okay fine  But then you still  You do not get  The same  You know  You're not prejudged  The same 
[00:51:00]  I don't care  Where you go  It's not the same  The point is  You're in this country  And it's not the same  And you know  You're making  Absolutely  No  Sense  And I'll tell you  Why  If you shut  Your big trap  Shut up  Shut up  Shut up  Shut up  You could be rude  If you like  But you're prejudging  You really are  So are you  So are you  So are you  You assumed  That I was black  Because of the way  I stand  This whole  I lived in the city 
[00:51:30]  You know what I mean  All that is prejudging  Now I  Now I  Now that  I don't really need  To defend myself  Because I really  Could care less  What people think of me  But I'll tell you  The reason why  I thought Julie  Was black Anthony  Why  It wasn't because  Of her voice  It was because  Of the beginning  Of her conversation  Where she stood up  For the black guy  And said  How dare anyone  You know  Prejudge  A black person  They have  And she 
[00:52:00]  See  I can't even  Concentrate  Listen to this bitch  Can you imagine  Going home to this lady  Every night  No but  Your friend  Had that before  Listen to this  Yeah  I'm listening  The deal is  You called up  To defend  The black person  I am not  Defending  And you did it  In a way  Saying  How dare  This guy  Talk blah blah  He has no idea  How it is  To walk around  The city  As a black person  That's  When I  Opie  Assumed  That you  Julie  Were black  Had nothing to do  With your stupid voice  Which is  And let me 
[00:52:30]  Tell you something  You said  Listen to how I  Yeah let me  Okay  If you  If you  I said  Listen to how you  Talk  Meaning what you  Said in your stupid  Conversation  You idiot  You're the idiot  Come on  You're the idiot  Now let me  Get my side  You said it  You said it  You said  Based on how I sound  Hey Julie  Yeah Julie  That was me  Based on how I sound  You figured I was black  Julie  Based  Julie  Based how you sound  Thank you  I'm still in the right  Julie  Based how you sound  What you were saying  This is pandemonium  Because I try to get a word in 
[00:53:00]  Can you  Can you  Can you  Let me talk  For a second  Please  I'm listening  Okay  Here we go  It was the content  Of your conversation  Not your dialect  That's what Opie's saying  That's what Opie's saying  But what I'm saying is  The way you sound  When you talk  Sounds like a lot  Of black people  That I listen to  And hear  You have a certain  Sound to your voice  Black people  When they talk  Not all of them  Don't lump it in  And say that  I'm saying all black people  I'm saying  That a lot of black people 
[00:53:30]  Sound like you do  On the phone  Okay  I understand where  You're coming from now  And I do  Are you going to deny that  I'm clarifying it  But originally  That's not what was said  You sound like a black woman  Talking on the phone  Excuse me  You sound like a black woman  Calling up this show  That's what your voice  Sounds like to me  Oh you were wrong  Okay  Alright  If you see me  You'll notice  If I don't tell you  That I'm hispatic  You would never know  What would I think  You would think  I was white 
[00:54:00]  Because many people do  Okay  Well what are you doing  Talking  What are you doing  According to you  As soon as I open my mouth  You would know I'm white  Well what are you doing  Talking like that  Excuse me  What are you doing  Talking like that  What do you mean  What I'm doing  Talking like that  What do you mean  What I'm doing  Talking like that  You got like a black  Twang to your voice  What if I'm a white person  From the south or something  What are you talking about  No it sounds like  Inner city black  No and guess what  I'm even raised  In the inner city  Well then how come  You sound like that  Because that's just 
[00:54:30]  The way I talk  I'm sorry  I don't sound  Lily white like you  Lily white  Well that's a little  Racist comment  You're making there  Hey Julie  You're trying to say  No white person  Sounds like me  I am  I see them on  The Jerry Springer show  All the time  They come out  They're called wiggers  No they're called wiggers  They come out  And they're white  And they start going  Yeah well I'll be  Hanging in my crib  You know  They're jibby  And we're hanging  And it's ridiculous  It looks ridiculous  Educational level 
[00:55:00]  You could just say  Educational level  Oh my god  You don't sound  Very educated  Julie  You don't sound  Very educated  I'm telling you  You don't sound  Very educated  But Julie  Can you take your lips  Off or auto flap  I can't hear what you're saying  Too bad  Oh boy  Auto flap  Yeah  Don't listen  Is that Opie  Yeah  You know the other guy  Sounds like he has  More cysts than you  He really does  I don't get that impression  He does  Because you know what 
[00:55:30]  I respect him  He clarified what he said  I clarified what I said  You just didn't want to listen  You have an issue  You really do  And you need to look  Into yourself  And you know what  Besides that  I do listen to your show  Whether you think  I'm educated or not  Because I don't care  What you think  You know  I really don't  I don't care  What you think  Because I know what I am  Blah blah  But the other guy  Has more sense  Obviously  Yeah that's great  I love Julie  Thinking I have more sense  No no no  You do  Because you said something  You clarified it 
[00:56:00]  That's honest  Where's the other one  Is trying to go  It's ridiculous  What  I said it's ridiculous  There we go  You know  How do you spell ridiculous  How do you spell ridiculous  Ridiculous  Hello  Oh she got off the track  Dude I can't wreck it  She got off the track  She hung up  God damn it  Right when you want a train  To hit somebody  They come off the track  I'm exhausted 
[00:56:30]  Oh my god  Oh my god  Wasn't she trying to talk  About the black experience  And then she  She was talking about  The black experience  And how do you know  What the black experience  Is all about  That's what I assumed  I was talking to a black lady  Turns out she's a Hispanic  But I assumed  It's early on the sound  Of her voice  And now she's a hypocrite  Because now she's trying  To tell everyone  What the black experience is  Even though she has  No freaking clue  What the black experience is  Because she's Hispanic  You know  Anybody that wants to tell me 
[00:57:00]  That there isn't a distinct  African American sound  To a voice  You could call it what you want  Call me a racist  Call me  I'm stereotyping  I'm bigoted  Whatever you want  You're going to tell me  That there isn't  A distinct sound  To a majority  Of African Americans  That the sound of the voice  I'm glad you added  That word  Because our buddy Chuck  Who calls the show a lot  Yeah  He sounds as white 
[00:57:30]  As they come  And our own black girl  Sounds as white as they come  I'm not saying  All blacks  Will sound like that  But when you get  A phone call  And a girl sounds  Like she did  You do assume  That it's a black person  Keith  Yo  What's up  Hey call the reporter  I just heard something  That was staged  Your girlfriend  Your girlfriend  See you guys later  Very good  Keith  Come on in  Come on in  Ah very good 
[00:58:00]  Everyone has a comment now  We'll take a couple  And then we gotta take a break  Joe what's up  How you doing Opie Anthony  Alright  I'm just saying  It's just where people  Receive things  You know  Like uh  How people talk  The way they're talking  I understand what you're saying there  Sorry I'm sounding a little bit nervous here  That's alright  Um  And uh  Are you an Asian man?  Nah  I'm not Asian  I'm actually um  I'm mixed  I'm Irish and Ecuadorian 
[00:58:30]  Irish and Ecuadorian  Yeah  Wow  That's pretty cool  Your dad must have been really drunk  You know  I was like  I got  I got  I'm vacation  So  Yeah  That's cool  Like I'm perceived  What are you  That's white  Right on man  So I just wanted  To let you know  It's just  It's just where people  Perceive things  And it sucks out  They  Actually  Show them  By the way  I apologize for  For stereotyping  I mean how do we know  If uh  Your dad is the drunk  And it wasn't your mom  Ah don't worry 
[00:59:00]  Who's the Irish drunk  It's like I'm used to it  I got my friends  My Italian friends  Always bug on me  Alright man  Thanks  Thank you  Bye  Uh Walter  Yes  What's up  Hey  Hey man  How you doing  I saw you guys  I met you guys  At Hooters  Yeah  That was a really cool show  I want to agree with you guys  I think everybody  Has a distinct  Uh sound  I think the only two  Black people  That don't sound black  Are Tony Gwynn  And Tiger Wood  I think for now on  I think we have to  Guess your race  If you call this show  I'm gonna  I'm guessing  I'm gonna guess 
[00:59:30]  Puerto Rican Anthony  Okay  Walter wait  Walter speak a little bit  Let Anthony get a chance at it  Okay sure  Uh  I don't know what else to say  I took a couple pictures  You guys at uh Hooters  I should be downloading them soon  Yeah I'll say Puerto Rican  Yeah  Uh wait wait wait  Okay  Yeah Puerto Rican  Close  Alright what is it  Well I'm actually Cuban  Ah  Yes  We don't find too many of those  In the city do we  I was gonna switch to Dominican  But uh Cuban  Cuban yeah  The rare of the few  The only ones we find 
[01:00:00]  In either Jersey or Miami  Well obviously Hispanic  Say if we just  Yeah I said Hispanic  Hispanic  Alright  But basically  I can like that  Girl I just talk to you guys  You can tell off the  Off the meat rack  That she was Puerto Rican  All the way  The way they talk  And the way they  Flapping about  A thousand miles an hour  I call it the machine gun syndrome  How they flap  How they flap  And flap  And they don't stop  You wonder how they  Gotta catch their breath  Between sentences  Because they're talking so fast  But that's a Spanish thing though  Whenever we speak Spanish  It's  Dicca dicca dicca dicca dicca dicca dicca dicca dicca dicca 
[01:00:30]  When you guys  Hispanics need to know  Spanish is a very fast language  But English isn't that fast  So slow it down a little bit  Right  Exactly  Slow it down  Slow it down  Slow it down  Slow it down  You know this is USA  But you know what I noticed too  Yeah  Like for example  You know I'm Cuban  I was born here  But there was like  For example  A point I was working around Mexicans  And after a while  I was speaking like the way they were  And people were thinking  I was Mexican  So sometimes it happens  That the people that you're around 
[01:01:00]  Might influence the way you speak  Even though you might not be of that background  Yeah  I don't know if you've ever seen that  Or experienced that  But I found that to be pretty interesting  You know  But I don't know what else to say to you guys  But I'm just so overwhelmed  Spats had me at home for an hour last week  I never got through to you guys  Ah there you go  But I'm so glad  I got to meet you guys  It's the first time on the show  I don't know what to say to you guys  But thanks so much  All right Walter  Glad to me about my opinion  And everything  All right Walter  But remember  The only two white  Starts a train  I'm sorry  No no no 
[01:01:30]  I don't want no train  All right  Mike what's going on  Yeah what's going on fellas  This chick with her black experience thing  I'm a white guy  That works in Harlem  The South Bronx  For the phone company  All day long  Let me tell you something  These people are nuts  They're throwing things out the window  They're going crazy  They see me  They think I'm a cop  They run away  Then they come on  You know  Hey what are you doing  I'm working  You know  What am I a cop  With a phone  Hanging off my belt  Right  What are you talking about  This black experience thing  If anybody  If any black guy  Talked like a white guy  In Harlem 
[01:02:00]  He'd be beaten by his friends  Until he was like  Yo what's up man  Well that's where  We get it all from  You know I mean  Everybody does have  Their distinct voice  And their distinct  Way of speaking  Of course  It's just reality  It has nothing to do  With racism or anything  It doesn't  It's not a racial thing  It's where you come  I'm sure a black guy  From Texas  Won't sound like a black guy  From Harlem  Yeah  You know  But so  When they have the comedians  Live from the Apollo Theater  And they make fun of Whitey  It's all well and good  Right  Yeah that's okay  But if I sat here

[01:15:30]  A serious run  For the presidency  Yeah  No matter how silly  We all think it is  And the rest of this country  Thinks it is  He is seriously  Going to make a run  For the presidency  She must have  Some friggin baggage  That he's gotta dump  This leggy wonder  You see the picture  In the daily news  Yeah  Where she's sprawled out  On the presidential seal  Across the presidential seal  Those legs could go around you twice  Mmhmm  Look at the size of them  She must have a serious flaw 
[01:16:00]  Somewhere in that body  For him to dump her  It's gotta be  That she  I don't know  Gave a Hummer  To Saddam Hussein  During the Gulf War  Or something  I don't know  There's gotta be  Some skeleton  In her closet  Yeah but  Is the presidency  Worth giving up  That?  That?  Well when you look  At what he's getting  Right now  Before he's president  And then you look  At what Clinton  Gets  As president  Yeah 
[01:16:30]  I don't know  You might want  To hold on to this one  And Clinton is  A little better looking  Than Trump  So if Clinton  Is getting that  Fat pig Monica  As president  Can you imagine  What Donald Trump  Is gonna be getting?  Well  Oh my god  God damn  Bob what's up?  Hey  What's going on?  You got this  Trump thing all wrong  He was married  To two of these women  Who took him  To the cleanest  Twice already  He finally smartened up  Well he doesn't  Have to marry her 
[01:17:00]  Yeah but she's  Probably hunting around  For a rent  He said  Ah screw this  She's not hunting  For anything  She's just  She's just there  She's  Yeah I mean  So he's dumping her  When was the last time  He saw Trump  With an ugly girl  Every girl you see him  Watch he's always hot  He's a cocky man  Cause how is he  Ever gonna be this  Cocky  Oh come on  Every picture you see  Of him in the papers  Man  He's got the cash  That's what it is  I mean  He'll find another one  He's not getting  Any younger  I mean  You gotta like  You know 
[01:17:30]  That doesn't matter  You gotta cash in  Eventually and say  You know what  It's not getting  Any better than this  So I'm gonna stick  With this one  For a while  You got the cash  You can get  Whatever you want  I don't know  Cash equals cash  Exactly  Exactly  Remember that  For what  What did we learn  On the show today  There you go  Alright Bob  Thank you  You guys are great  Bye  Tim you're next  On the show  What's up  Yeah how you guys doing  Alright  From what I heard  On the news  The reason he dumped  This luscious piece of ash  Is actually one of the reasons  Was she posed 
[01:18:00]  On that presidential seal  In the magazine  Yeah  They were just talking about  And apparently Donald  Has felt that  As inappropriate  And I think he also  Didn't want to  There was talk about  How he's a  Remember the mile high  Club with this girl  And I think  He wants to  Be respectable  I'm saying  He's never gonna get  Oh he will get  A girl that could  Look at him  But Jesus Christ  The deal is  Donald Trump  Donald Trump  As president  That's a goof  Wouldn't it be great  That a first lady  Who looks like that  Are you kidding me  Oh my god  Imagine that  Hell to the chief  And his wife  Just imagine 
[01:18:30]  What goes on  In the Lincoln bedroom  Nothing would get done  For this country  Yeah  He's just  Excuse me  I'm banging my girl here  Right  All our foreign interests  Would  Well that's a way  It might work  In our favor though  He invites over  These foreign dignitaries  And whatever he wants  He's like  I'll let you see her naked  You know  They parade her  Into the rose garden  She drops her clothes  Whatever you want  Whatever  And 
[01:19:00]  She has hot friends  Yeah  All of a sudden  You see all the leaders  Of the world  Walking around  With supermodels  All happy  They're all patting  Each other on the back  And high fiving  Before you know it  There's peace on earth  Peace of ass on earth  He's got a plan  For god's sake  I'm voting for him  You know  They're having  Those middle east  Peace talks  Yeah  Where the hell  Are they doing that  Like in the middle  Of Virginia or something  Is that the truth  Nowhere down there  Right  Why here  You know what  Would solve that whole thing 
[01:19:30]  You just get a bunch  Of broads  Do it in a strip club  They'll sign anything  All kinds of foreign currency  Going into the g-strings  Before you know it  They're all drunk pals  Right  What are we arguing about  Mike what's up  Hey  You go up and down the city  You see the most horrible looking guys  With the most beautiful girls  And it's usually one or two things  It's money  Or it's something big in the pants 
[01:20:00]  And it's never something big in the pants  It's always just the money  Well  I had said it  Cash equals gash  Oh man  You know  A ten is a two  With eight million dollars  You know  Yeah  There you go  Alright  Thank you man  Take care guys  Bye  I mean when he walked out  At the Belmont Stakes  When I went there  And saw him and this chick  Like live  We walked out  Onto the blue balcony thing  And everyone's just  Booing the Donald  And then they're like 
[01:20:30]  You know  Cat calling  Whistling at this chick  She's gorgeous  He has to be gay  What?  Has to be gay  I don't know about that  Why would you  Like  Even care about the presidency  If you got that  He probably told her  Lay low  I'll still hook you up  And stuff  I'll come over occasionally  Bang you  I'll hook you up in a place  And then if I win the presidency  You know  You move right in  Then I'm president  And no one can do anything about it  You know  But he's not going to be president  I know  But then after he's not the president 
[01:21:00]  Then he's like  I'm still banging her anyway  I'm sick of the papers  Reporting this  As this is a serious thing  That could possibly happen  It's not going to happen  Donald Trump  For president  Nah  It ain't going to happen  Everyone knows that  It's going to be  George W. Bush  President  Just like my father  Going to be president  That's it  He's the guy  Georgie  You think  It's going to be Bradley  No Bradley's hurting in the polls lately

Are you going to do  A Super Bowl party  And giveaway  And  Super  Are you going to  Sorry  Are you going to do  A Super Bowl party  And giveaway  Like last year  I want another chance  To win a big screen TV  I was runner up last year  Well  We  We  We  We decided not to do  What we did last year  No  Nothing against the party  We went to  But we felt  Very out of place  Anthony 
[01:25:30]  Yeah  Kind of weird  Last year  They sent us to  People's houses  Like that's  Me and Opie  Opie and Ollie  Went to  A house  A guy won  A big screen TV  And a Super Bowl party  Sponsored by us  Plus  Us  As guests  At his party  So  We pull up to the house  And trust me  That's no treat  To have us  Yeah  Nice enough  People and everything  We go in  But just picture  Picture this  Super Bowl Sunday  Leave your house 
[01:26:00]  Walk to a house  Where you don't know anyone  But there's a lot of cars  And you know  There's a real good party  Going on inside  Knock on the door  And go  Hey what's up  And then walk in  It's a little awkward  And then try to get along  With the people  And stuff  Yeah  And like  There was a couple  People I could talk to  And everything  You know  But I just felt  I don't know  We had a good time  Yeah  But see  I mean no one could  I guess one of the problems  Is that  You know  We were the big prize  And a year ago  No one really cared  Yeah 
[01:26:30]  So we showed up  As the big prize  And I swear to god  There had to be what  50, 60 people  In this house  Yeah  40 of them easily  Had no freaking clue  Who we were  And could care less  And most of them  Were like  Why are they here  Which you know  Is fine  I mean you know  Who the hell would we  Right  But it's  Which is silly enough  Like even now  Who the hell cares  Right  But they were  They were very nice to us  Yeah  They treated us well  Although I left  We left at halftime  Didn't we  Like third quarter  Yeah  Did we leave at third quarter 
[01:27:00]  Yeah  I thought it was halftime  All of a sudden  I ate some Swedish meatballs  Over there  Right  And oh my god  I was percolating  I was driving  I swear  I was supposed to go  Out to my mom's house  Out east  Yeah  I stepped on the gas  I was racing  To get home  I had to just go home  My stomach hurt so bad  Came out the same way  They went in  Swedish meatballs  Like Benoit balls  Like a tennis ball launcher 
[01:27:30]  It's terrible  So I guess we're not  Going to be doing that  This year  No  I think we're  Trying to like  Throw a huge  Superbowl bash  Yeah  I think that would be  Much more our style  My family's having a party  I'm going to want to  Party  With my family's  Can we broadcast  From your  Your family's  Yeah  Let's do that  That could be a lot of fun  We'll do that  Alright  Now we'll see what happens  We might throw something together  Yeah we're going to try  To figure it out 
[01:28:00]  Like everything else  On this show  Never know  We had some great ideas  Today in our  Little brainstorming session  Yes we did  Upcoming things  For the rest of the year  That I think people  Will enjoy  Yeah we're starting  To actually  Prep for our show  Don't get carried away  Slow down  Slow down  We're actually  Trying to start  To put some thought  Into what we do  Yeah  Couple of  Couple of minutes a day  Yeah  Trying to think  Things out a little bit 
[01:28:30]  Maybe  But I came up  With a few things  I think might be fun  Yeah we don't want  To pop them yet  But the funny thing is  You know we're having  These brainstorming meetings  Like once a week  And we want everyone  To come to the  Don't you need a brain  For brainstorming  Well yeah  There's plenty of  Storm going on in there  Not much brain  And we told everyone  That's involved in these  Meetings to come  To the table  With some ideas  That we can throw around  Yeah  And Spaz is hilarious  He was so excited  Like he found out  That we were having  This meeting a week ago  And he couldn't wait 
[01:29:00]  To tell everyone his idea  He was so happy  That he was in the meeting  And he's got his little  Notebook out and everything  He like opened up  His little notebook  And he's taking little  Notes and everything  And he had his idea  Written down  Now everyone's throwing  Ideas left and right  About what we want to do  I hate to stop you  Yeah  There's a guy  On line three  Because we'll get right  Back to what you're saying  Yeah  That was at the  Super Bowl party  Last year that we attended  Oh really  John what's going on  Hey what's going on  Hey man  Hey man  You don't like  My girlfriend's 
[01:29:30]  Swedish meatball  Those things man  It was like  I was a Gatling gun  When I went home  We had fun  But no one really cared  You know what I mean  Was it really that bad  No  No I don't want you guys  To be pissed at us  You guys were completely fine  But it was like  Kind of  A little awkward  It was awkward for everyone  Because I mean  Most of the people  Didn't even know who we were  Well they did know who you were  Just you know  There's a lot of  People don't listen to your show  How many times have you guys  Played the tape of  Ant and I 
[01:30:00]  Just watching the Super Bowl  About 50 times  Like after everybody knew  You know  You guys are so famous  They kept playing  They put a camera  In the corner  I found this a little awkward  Because then I felt like  I had to do stuff  Because I knew  They would show this tape  A million times  And they have  These people have a tape  That's got to be  Two hours long  And all it is  Is Ant and I  Sitting on the couch  Watching the Super Bowl  Yeah with the rest of the people  Can we talk by any chance 
[01:30:30]  About that girl  Jamie who called up earlier  Can we touch her  I don't know  Which one was she again  What  Oh she was the  Black chick that wasn't black  Oh the Hispanic one  She had to be black  By the way she talked  You know she had the  The accent  She was black  Right  You just tell  Alright John  And uh  I live in Armour, New York  My name is Rob  Alright  What  Huh  I didn't get that part  I don't either  Is he tricking us  I don't know  I hate when people trick you 
[01:31:00]  And then hang up  Before you hear what they said  Right  Like if you want to trick us  You could stay on the line  It's okay  Was there a Baba Booey in there  And we missed it  I don't think so  Okay  Anyway  So we were doing the brainstorming  Where everyone had to come to the table  With some ideas  And like we said  Spaz  Very excited  Um  Couldn't wait to tell everyone his idea  Right  His notebook and everything  He was very excited  To even be part of the meeting  You know  And we're all thrown around  Some ideas  Having some laughs  Talking about what we want to do  In the upcoming year 
[01:31:30]  On the Opie and Anthony show  And uh  And we're pretty much done with it  And we're waiting  And we finally go  Well Spaz  Do you have any ideas  And this is after like an hour  Of like  Oh my god  That's a great idea  We can do this  We're all freaking out  Everything that was mentioned  And Spaz  And goes  Well  Yeah I got an idea  And it's very exciting too  Because some of these ideas  That we're putting forth  For the Opie and Anthony show  Huge things  Yeah  It's not just like  These little things  I mean big things  Because now  It seems  We have cautious optimism  That we are being backed 
[01:32:00]  By the new regime  Here in place  At WNEW  There will be some money  Behind the show  And some sponsorships  And we'll be able to go out  And do some fun stuff  In the upcoming year  I'll believe it  If they get our CD out  Which they're working on  As we speak  Very good  Alright  So Spaz  End of the meeting  It's like  Oh and Spaz  Do you have an idea  Yeah  Thumbs through his little notebook  Finds his little idea 
[01:32:30]  Page  Eight man fight club elimination  Tournament  Tournament  Like what?  Yeah  We get like  And I think he met listeners  Wait get in here  Like did he mean just us?  He wanted  There's about eight people  That are regulars on the show  And he wanted an eight man  Look how bad he feels  Come on Spaz  I didn't think it was a good idea  But it's the best one I had  Of all the ones I'd written down  What were some of the other 
[01:33:00]  I want some of the other ones  Come on right now  It's in my little notebook  Alright get  Get your little notebook  Get your little notebook  I gotta hear  The ones you rejected  Eight  He's running down the hall  Go see who's on the warm line  It might be someone  Eight man fight club  Elimination tournament  So basically he wanted  He wants us to brawl  And he's singing this  In front of the new bosses  And we're like  Shut up  Shut up  Fight club doesn't exist  Shut up  Don't talk about fight club  Because everyone's like  The new guys are like  What's fight club about  Oh it's  Nothing  Bit  No big deal 
[01:33:30]  Yeah a little bit  It's something we staged  So Dave Hinckley writes about it  Yeah  That we're actually kicking  Each other's asses  Here in the studio  Ass  Hinckley  So basically  He wanted a tournament set up  To see who's the strongest guy  In the show  Alright  Here's a little daily show  Daily planner  Yeah  From the daily show  Okay  I figured this would help me  Get a little bit more  In sync with the show  There you go  Very good  So these are the ideas  That you were too scared  To mention 
[01:34:00]  Yeah  Because I didn't think  They were that good  As good as the fight club  Tournament one  You're really proud of  The eight man elimination  Fight club tournament  Yeah  Well for now  Yeah  Okay  Other ideas had  Was the  Opie and Anthony  Dating game  Alright  Well can you explain  The Opie and Anthony  Dating game  How does it work  I was thinking about this  On a train ride in  I don't know 
[01:34:30]  I was thinking about  Instead of having  The standard of asking questions  Right  We just have like  A really hot girl here  And have three guys  Just do like  Something like  I don't know  Like think of something crazy  And they're training me  Right  Alright  We acknowledge the train  We gotta stop the train  Okay  Yeah  Just  No  Just have something  Just think of crazy  We had a brainstormer  About it  But I just came up  With the basic idea for it  Dating game  Dating game  That hasn't been done  On the radio before  That's good  Okay  The remake of 
[01:35:00]  The Tom Likus opener  I like his  I don't think he's  He's gonna be working  Here much longer  Yeah  Okay  That's stupid too  Yeah  What else  My next stupid one  Is boob weight lifting  Boob weight lifting  Boob weight lifting  Yeah just tie little  Hardasses to their boobs  And just have them lift  Well we did the  Penis weight lifting  So I figured  To include women  In this  And boob  I don't think  Ladies boobs  Are as strong  As a guy's junk  Come on  Oh he's getting a little angry

[02:11:30]  Did Julie your cruise director  Give you a blast of coke  And then go south  You know  And I mean  I guess I started getting into it  And all of a sudden  Captain Steubing  Turned into my cat  And I think that's because  My husband was using  You know  The P word  Right  You know  Captain Steubing  On the love boat  The next thing I know  I'm having sex with my cat  On the love boat  Give me some bald head  That's funny

[02:12:30]  Remembering details  Wait a minute  Maybe I should keep  This one of myself  That made no sense  Jessie  Hello  How are you  Good  Good  I pretend to be  Having sleep sex sometimes  You have sleep sex  No I pretend to  With my boyfriend  Like I pretend I'm asleep  Because that way  You can do the things  That you would normally do  That you won't  You know what I mean  You put on a personality  That you don't want him  To know that you have  And what do you usually pretend  Usually I start by  Pleasuring myself 
[02:13:00]  Because I know that  Kind of turns him on  And you can't do that  When you're awake  I don't  You know I like to  I like for him to think  That I'm a little bit  More demure than that  Right  So you know  When I pretend that I am  Then I am a lot more wild  So you make believe  You're completely out cold  And you're playing with yourself  Knowing he's watching  You open your eye  Every once in a while  To see if he's checking it out  Absolutely  And then  And then he'll start  And you know  I'll talk dirty  You know  We'll do the whole nine  You know 
[02:13:30]  Just  And it's absolutely  In the scene  Sex  Because  He thinks I'm  Completely asleep  The next morning  He'll be like  Oh my god  You have no idea  What you did  I'm like  Oh no  You're right  That's not me  I can't believe I did that  Right  So I get to keep  The whole demure act up  At the same time  You know  You girl  You ladies have a racket  I'm telling you man  Jesus  That's awesome  Yeah  He pretty much seems  To enjoy it too  Very good  Thank you  Alright Jesse  I think Jesse  Has the best story of the day

[02:36:30]  I only played  Like the beginning  Of the game  I wasn't really into it  What type of game is it  It's a first person  First person perspective  Doom type of game  And I'll tell you why  I couldn't get into it  Because I watch it  Every day  Every day  Before the show  Just going nuts  In Half-Life  Online  Multiplayer  And then you get  You know  Medal of Honor  On Playstation  And to me  It's a little primitive  Well  I was also  Looking for like  Codes  Because they have 
[02:37:00]  Codes for like  Infinite ammo  Sheet codes  Sure  You get them on websites  Or you get them  Even some magazines  And some of the  Electronics boutique  Has whole cheat books  And stuff  Yeah  Do you have a computer?  Nah  Well I have a crap one  Well find like a friend  That has a good computer  Go to Yahoo  Punch in Medal of Honor  And a crap load of stuff  Will pop up  As far as cheat codes  And stuff go  Alright  One more question  Yeah  But I mean  In all fairness  You know  Psycho Mark loved 
[02:37:30]  Medal of Honor  It's one of my favorite games  But I've played Half-Life  And you know  Showed me around  The Half-Life game  But see  I'm not like  Type of the person  That sits at that hard  Chair  And plays with the mouse  Yeah  I like in my couch  You know  Yeah  With a nice beer pop  And you know  Oh believe me  I do the same thing  Beer  One more question  When's your CD  Coming out man  I've been waiting  Since October for this 
[02:38:00]  Well you know  We have new management  Here at WNEW  Right  And they are  As we speak  Trying to make it happen  Oh word man  They shoved the whole project  Back in the lawyers' faces  And said  Make this work  Right  Make this work  For the guys  That's what I'm talking about  Alright man  Alright  You guys suck  Is that a train bro  Alright  Thank you  I don't know  If cringe will ever  Make it out  But we'll see  I hope so  Money talks though  In this company  I said  Do you guys realize  How much money 
[02:38:30]  Our CD will make  I know  Between our audience  In New York  And our audience  In Boston  A double CD  For our listeners  I hope it does now  Jesus Christ  That'd suck  If it didn't  Nah  It's a guarantee  We're really proud  Of the project  Yeah  So we'll see  What happens  That game  Rick got me  That Unreal Tournament  Oh my god  That's good  That I put up there too  With Half-Life  As far as playing online  Yeah  Half-Life was a great game  For one player  When you're just  Getting on 
[02:39:00]  And playing the whole game  A lot of the games  Coming out now  Like Unreal  And Quake 3  Arena  They're made for online play  Which is great  I mean they're great  Multiplayer games  But I have not seen  One thing  Come close  To how good  Half-Life was  To just run through  As a single player game  Really  Fantastic  System Shock 2  Pretty close  Pretty good  The other one  The Half-Life  The second one  That just came out  That I just finished  Opposing Force  Pretty good  But not as good  As the original 
[02:39:30]  Very  A lot of the same stuff  You know  Going on  I'm doing  Tomb Raider  Last Revelation  Right now  How's that working for you  It's getting  It's a really good game  Because it starts out  Really easy  And just gets harder  As the game goes  I kind of like that  So I mean right now  It's just getting  Really frustrating  But it's alright  You know  I'm waiting for the new  Team Fortress 2  To come out  From Half-Life  And in the meantime  I'm actually playing  The original Half-Life  Again on  Expert setting  Very difficult 
[02:40:00]  To get through  But I know  It's coming  So it kind of sucks  Yeah  I wish they'd come out  With another really  Good game like that  I mean to this day  Though  I mean my two  Favorite Playstation games  Syphon Filter  Yeah that one was good  That was really good  And Silent Hill  Yeah that was scary  Silent Hill is just  Man  I like crap like that  I like the creepy stuff  The stuff with the story  Behind it  The stuff you've got  To kind of think  And shoot  You've got to get  A Playstation  And play Silent Hill  Yeah  You would really enjoy it  And the puzzles 
[02:40:30]  Are kind of  A little tricky  You've got to think  A little bit  I'm pretty  And the creatures  Are great  The nurses  With the hearts  Beating on their back  On the outside  Of their skin  I need graphics  And the dogs  That like attack you  That have like  It looks like  They've been torn  Inside out  And they run around  Oh it's just great  I need graphics now though  I really do  I mean I need  The top of the line graphics  So Playstation  I don't know  I might be a little  Disappointed  I'm telling you though  Every time I pick up  A Playstation game  They're just moving forward  With the graphics 
[02:41:00]  And everything else though  I mean Last Revelation  Tomb Raider  The graphics are so much  Better on that game  Than it was for  Tomb Raider 3  And it's only like  What a year and a half  Difference  Yeah  In the two games  Yeah  I mean I'd get one of those  Just so I could like  You said hang out  On the couch and stuff  It's great  Better than just  Sitting at the computer  On those Sony Tron glasses  We got  Yeah  So now you can like  Lay on your couch  With your head  All the way back  On a pillow  And you can play the game  On the ceiling  I gotta check that  Or it looks like  It's on the ceiling  With those Sony glasses 
[02:41:30]  They gave us  Jim what's up  Yeah listen  You already said  You played Siphon Filter  But  Wait  Were you feeling  A little jealous there  Jim  He was listening to the show  And he heard us  I said you know  Laying on my back  Playing  Playstation  With the glasses  Looks like it's on the ceiling  I'm dying  I'm sitting here dying  Man I got a 35 inch TV  I played on  But I'd rather have the glasses  I picked up on some though  Because you didn't  You didn't know  We went to you  And I hear  Oh that's great  I wish I had that  I need that  I heard about it  From you guys  And I priced it 
[02:42:00]  Man I'm looking at that  I'm going to go wow  Got to go there  Yeah  The price is up there  But the price  Is going to come down  Like crazy  Because it's going to be  The new Rage  Very soon  That's what I'm waiting for  So what up  PC game  Yeah  Hidden and dangerous  Hidden and dangerous  Is that that  World War 2 one  Yeah  The graphics on that  Are pretty good  Yeah  I was looking at that  That looked pretty good  Yeah I play it  I have it at home  It's decent  It really is  Is it a first person shooter  You know  It can be  It's both a first person  And a strategy shooter  And you can take your pick  And the sniper mode  On that thing  Is awesome  God I love the sniper mode 
[02:42:30]  In any game  Oh give me the sniper rifle  Zoom in and just  Take off some heads  Absolutely  The sniper feature  Is hitting every game  Because even Tomb Raider  Has now a sniper  Sniper feature  Sniper feature  There's nothing better  On the crossbow  Zooming in and just watching  Like in Half-Life  When he used the crossbow  Yep  You zoom in  You just  And you see the guy  Just fly back  Oh my god  He didn't even know  I was there  This thing is cool  You can take over tanks  You can shoot tanks  I mean you can shoot  From the tank  You can shoot off machine guns 
[02:43:00]  You take over weapons  You drive trucks  And the enemy  Is intelligent  It hears you  And it comes looking for you  That's a lot  The way it is  With Half-Life 2  Yeah  Artificial intelligence  It's great  Yep  Like they chase you  The soldiers in Half-Life  If you come around the corner  And one sees you  And you run away  Yep  It doesn't matter  They're chasing you  Oh yeah  And they'll throw grenades at you  And they're accurate  Absolutely  It's fun  Man can you imagine  Another five years  It's just going to be  I know  Completely out of hand  The game  That much better 
[02:43:30]  Alright Jim  Yeah you take care  You guys are great  Hey thank you  Timothy  All I wanted when I was a kid too  Was like games  And computer games  Were like in its infancy  But I wanted them  I wanted to play them  I loved them  I went to some stupid arcade  Where I would pump  Quarter after quarter  Into a machine  To land a lunar module  I remember that  And you had a little stick  With a thrust control buttons  And you had to land the thing  And you had to figure out  To make sure you had enough gas  Right  And all that  And make sure you didn't  Come in too fast  Or the thing would crash 
[02:44:00]  This was the best thing  In the world  I completely remember that  And it was ridiculous  Two dimensional  Little lunar lander  Would come off  Of the command module  You had to turn it  With the retros  And slowly bring it down  Without running out of gas  Like you said  And keep your  Keep it so you wouldn't  Drift to the left or right  And I was like  Oh I need this for my house  You know  It's this big clunky unit  So whenever new games  Come out  Or new technology  Comes out  I gotta have it  Gotta check it out  A slide of Voodoo 2  Graphics caught on my computer  Three weeks later 
[02:44:30]  Voodoo 3 is out  Oh Voodoo 2  Goes to my brother  Joe  See you later  Boom Voodoo 3  Goes in the machine  Yeah  You think  You know how we laugh  At the first  You know  Computer games and stuff  Yeah  You think in like  10-15 years  People are going to  Just be laughing  At what the games were  In the year 2000  I'm sure they will be  Cause it's going that fast  Like look 5 years ago  What the graphics looked like  And look at them now  It's just going to  Get that much better  There's a graphics card  Coming out  That of course  I'm going to have to have  That has to plug in 
[02:45:00]  To the wall  Now you know  You plug the card  Into the back of your computer  A plug comes in  For the fan  To cool the processor off  Cause it's handling  So much of the graphics  That it overheats  So it's a fan  That has to plug into your wall  Just for the graphics  Card  Wow  Oh I need it  I need it  That's got to be good  I want a water cooled  Graphics card  I want something  That looks like  A big engine  On my living room floor  Pumping glycol  Through my computer 
[02:45:30]  To keep it cool  Because of my graphics card  Yeah  Timothée  You're next  Hey what's up guys  Alright  Alright  I just want to say  Most of the games  Medal of Honor  And Silent Hill  I've played them all  Medal of Honor  I beat  I beat it with the bronze star  Did you like Medal of Honor  Yeah  As you guys were saying  About the soldiers being smart  They're the same thing  In that game  Like I throw a grenade at them  They pick it up  And throw it right back at me  And blow them in hot  Yeah  And like they have bazookas  And they  I mean you lock up  You shoot the guy in the head  And the next thing you know 
[02:46:00]  He pulls out a bazooka  And like blows me away  Yeah I mean the game's  Getting rave reviews  But the graphics  Are just a little  Primitive for me  I know like you start off  You're in the woods  And all that  I mean that's kind of hard  But then you get to like  Inside the buildings  Into a V2 rocket plan  And all this cool stuff  Oh cool  Maybe I should play the game  A little further then  You even get to get onto  A U-boat and all that  And blow it up  And submerge it  And it's cool  That sounds cool  It's cool  Well I'm going to give it  Another try then  And I played  Also that Lunar Lander game  That's pretty cool too  Yeah remember that  Years ago man  Yeah it's like  The kind of 
[02:46:30]  Moon winds  Kind of blow you  Back and forth  You got to like  Move it  Go too fast  Yeah  Even when I saw Pong  I was mesmerized  A stupid little ball  Going back and forth  With the paddles  How the hell  They figure out  How you can  Play a game  Right on your TV  Only movie stars  Are on TV  Opie  Right  Look now I'm  Playing a game  On the TV  I must be special  Let me get up  And turn the channel  See what's on  I was always jealous  Watching Wonderama  That they would  Give away one of those  Pong games 
[02:47:00]  A Pong game  And a Ross Apollo bicycle  With a snake can game  And it was like  Oh if I could only  Get on Wonderama  And Bob McAllister  Could give me  A Pong game  Yeah  Ain't happening  Alright Timothy  Thank you  One more thing  About Silent Hill  Yeah  I was going to say  I've made it to the end  I mean I won't spoil it  Because I don't know  If guys are trying  To get some information  At me about it  I don't want to spoil it  For him or any of that  Right  But I got to the end  Of the game  And you have to get  This one thing  In order to get to this place  You can't get the thing 
[02:47:30]  Without like  I can't  I'll tell you  Off air or whatever  But it's so hard  There's like what  Four or five endings  To that damn game  Yeah  There's different endings  And I have to get  This one thing  In order to get to get it  Right  I have  Like  Here I'll tell you this  It's electrified  In order to get to  You have to shut  The electricity off  Right right right  You have to take  An elevator to get it  Right  And since you turn the electricity  Off you can't  The elevator so I'm like  Screw it  I'm in like one place  I just beat it  I'm trying to remember  What I did  Because that  That goes back  About a year and a half now  Yeah I mean  Same with me  I've been playing in a while 
[02:48:00]  And I thought I was in the hospital  And Spaz was like  Proving me wrong  And I'm like  Oh really  I can't  I don't remember  That much  I can't  I can't remember  I can't remember  What I ate  For lunch man  Yeah  Alright Timothy  There you go  Thanks  Alright man  Take it easy  You guys suck  Alright man  One more  Greg  Hey Greg  What's up  What's up guys  Alright  Love the show  Been listening for a long time  Wanted to talk to Ant  Yeah  Hey Ant  Have you tried the  Tribes game online yet  Not online  No  Dude you gotta try that out

[02:56:00]  Oh it's not five minutes  I'm going to put in five minutes  Before Letterman  Then I'm going to go to bed  After Letterman  I never put time constraint  I always put level constraint  I'm like  Oh right after I get around  This corner  And take out the guy  I'll uh  I'll hang it up  You know what sucks  About these games  Like you're in  Like a really involved level  Okay  Yeah  And it takes you a real long time  To really figure it out  You finally figure it out  And you were saying  In your head the whole time  As soon as I figure out  This level  I'm going to bed 
[02:56:30]  Yeah  I accomplished a mini goal  In this game  I'm going to bed  Right  But then all of a sudden  Like let's say  The exit door opens  For that level  You pop into a whole  Brand new world  It's like  You're like  Oh  I gotta explore  Before I go to bed  You can't go to bed  Now just take a quick look  Around the room  Take a quick look  And then you're in it  Next thing you know  It's 4.35 in the morning  Exactly  And you're like  Oh  They're terrible  How did they do this  How did they do this to us  It's an addiction  It really is  Danny  From the Bronx  Talking about Medal of Honor again 
[02:57:00]  Says  The best is when you go undercover  And the guards give you the Nazi salute  It's a World War II game  And you pull out your gun  And blow their head right off  The look on their face  When they realize who you are  And try to run  Is priceless  That brings up something too  Because we've been playing games for years  And he used to be the little pixelated  Two dimensional animated character  If you had to shoot anything  That was it  No blood  No nothing  It was kind of a  Ding  And he's out 
[02:57:30]  You know  Yeah  When Miss Pac-Man died  Who cares  Yeah who cares  Waka waka  Right  But now  I mean  The faces have expressions  You shoot them  And the arms fly back  The body slumps in the corner  Blood flows out  In Half-Life  You set a landmine  And he trips it  And it blows up  You see meat and bone chunks  Flying past you  A face  Yeah  A face flies past you 
[02:58:00]  Yeah  And goes on the floor  And just a smear  And if you had a little relationship  With that person in the game  You kind of feel bad  You kind of do  Yeah  You kind of do  Like you could recruit  A couple of people  In Half-Life  So you recruit one of the cops  That are one of the security guards  In the plant that you're in  And he goes  Okay you know  Maybe we'll make it  If we stick together  Make it a little longer  He comes with you  All of a sudden  A big monster comes out  And just hacks him to pieces  You're like  Huh  I was kind of getting attached

[03:01:00]  In  When Bob McAllister  Was still hosting it  Yeah  That one was  Four hours long  About four hours long  Oh you could wake up  On Sunday morning  At like 7 o'clock  In the morning  And watch Wonderama  Until Soul Train  Came on  At like midnight  At midnight  At noon  You don't know  What they put  Kids  This was like  Scared straight  For kids  They would  Two things  I remember  Particularly  Remember the  Go-go  Session

[03:02:00]  Metro media  Television  The stage  Manager  Was like  Hitler  Okay  You were there  From probably  Eight o'clock  In the morning  To probably  Ten o'clock  At night  For a six  Year old kid  That's  Two days  The other thing  I remember  Is that when  You know how  They always advertise  Didn't they give you  Ice cream  And krause  Hot dogs  Yeah  What they gave you  Was they gave you  Halfway through  For lunch  They gave you  The Jumer  Ice cream sticks  But only like
