<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts discussing their controversial radio career and Opie's strained relationship with his mother, highlighted by a recounted phone call where she criticized a joke he made about her.  They then shared anecdotes about dysfunctional family gatherings, including a humorous story about a drunk relative searching for a piano at Thanksgiving.  Opie also mentioned attending Bob Kelly's Thanksgiving and the possibility of Kelly (aka Magic Bob) appearing on the show. The conversation transitioned to the rapid shift from Thanksgiving to Christmas decorations in NYC, the awkwardness of the Thanksgiving Day Parade, and Opie's need to store a firearm at a police precinct due to security concerns.  They then delved into WikiLeaks revelations about world leaders, focusing on gossipy details.  A significant portion focused on a Jesse Ventura JFK assassination conspiracy theory program, contrasting it with Vincent Bugliosi's work, and a graphic MSNBC segment on teen sex slaves.  The segment concluded with previews for the next day's show, including Kenny G as a guest and a major announcement regarding additional show dates for an upcoming event.

The next segment heavily featured upcoming guest appearances, movie reviews, and clips from a past, awkward interview with the recently deceased Leslie Nielsen.  Ozzy Osbourne's impending appearance was discussed, along with reviews of *The Kids Are All Right*, *Eat Pray Love*, *Happiness*, *Love Actually*, and *The Carter*.  The Leslie Nielsen interview clips showcased his apparent cognitive decline, prompting humorous exchanges and candid commentary from guest Nick DiPaolo.  A caller shared a story echoing the *Eat Pray Love* theme of misguided "rediscovery."

The show then transitioned into jokes about a celebrity death (possibly Ed Asner) and past altercations with Leslie Nielsen, followed by a discussion mocking the Black Friday/Cyber Monday frenzy.  D.L. Hughley joined the show in studio, sharing his negative experiences in radio, including a legal battle with a syndicator.  He discussed the absurdities of air travel, focusing on the inconveniences of coach versus first class.  A significant portion focused on Hughley's cologne, "Black Afghano," and its potent scent.  Further discussion covered his dislike of radio ratings, the difficulties of working in the entertainment industry, and his experiences with sponsors. The segment included a bizarre rendition of a Christmas song, followed by a detailed, crude discussion about an intern's awkward massage encounter with D.L. Hughley.  The show concluded this segment with racially charged jokes and speculation about the racial background of another intern, Sam, suggesting a DNA test to determine his heritage.

The following segment continued the discussion of Sam's potential Black ancestry, linking it jokingly to Thomas Jefferson.  The conversation, punctuated with racial slurs and stereotypes, shifted to family secrets and paternity revelations, with D.L. Hughley recounting discovering at age 12 that his father wasn't his biological father.  He also shared a theory by Patrice O'Neal about his mother's treatment of him.  The hosts and Hughley engaged in vulgar and sexually charged commentary on physical attributes and racial stereotypes regarding women's body types.  The discussion touched upon racial bias, specifically regarding discomfort about a Black president and implicit bias in fields like football coaching.  They discussed political correctness, honesty in public discourse, and societal reactions to offensive statements, including their personal political views and family dynamics.  The segment concluded with Hughley's anecdote about his wife's strict religious beliefs contrasting with his own.

The final segment featured D.L. Hughley discussing his wife's devout religious beliefs contrasted with his own less conventional lifestyle, including their differing views on sex and drug use, along with humorous anecdotes about her behavior.  The conversation shifted to his career, his upcoming comedy shows, and the negative aspects of online message boards, particularly racist comments. Opie and Anthony praised Hughley's comedic talent.  The segment concluded with promotional announcements for Hughley's shows, Ozzy Osbourne's appearance the next day, and a major announcement from one of the hosts regarding the “OPNN Show” (OPNN 3) on Sirius XM.  A running joke about determining Ozzy Osbourne’s race via a DNA test persisted throughout.

[00:27:30]  previously secret documents and the gossipy chatter occurred behind the backs of the heads of state  north korean madman kim jong-il is a flabby old chap who suffered physical and psychological  trauma after his stroke in 2008 now they don't say who's saying that uh also libyan strongman  momar gaddafi rarely leaves home without a voluptuous blonde who's a ukrainian nurse  you want a ukrainian nurse love a ukrainian like ursula anvers yeah you would love to  you would love to walk around with one of those right with an anima bag with her at all times 
[00:28:00]  just put her ample asshole on my nose cutcasters german chancellor angela merkel is a risk averse  is a risk averse and rarely creative oh boy italian prime minister silvio this is my favorite because  of the word they use berlusoni is feckless vain and ineffective could you tell me what feckless means  i don't know but i'm gonna say it's probably not good yeah that could be the greatest word ever  feckless you probably never heard anyone go this is my feckless companion 
[00:28:30]  what does feckless mean feckless feckless would mean uh ineffective incompetence something like that  here's something feckless attempts to repair the plumbing let's say something like that feckless uh  off the top of my head having no sense of responsibility indifferent lazy could also be  why didn't they use the word it's an adjective um all right why didn't they use incompetent then  why the big words always because it sounds better yes they're talking about the prime minister of 
[00:29:00]  italy they wanted to sound smart there was a few i don't know the bombshells but the iran getting  sophisticated missiles from north korea capable of hitting major cities in western europe that's big  and i'm glad everybody knows that saudi donors and we all knew this of course yeah i hate that  fucking country saudi donors are the chief financiers of sunni militant groups like al-qaeda  and the tiny state of qatar is the worst in the region in counterterrorism efforts  and afghanistan vice president ahmed zia masoud was suspected of corruption after he was caught 
[00:29:30]  52 million in cash while the united arab emirates list you 52 million in cash  and they suspect what's he doing with that dude come on if i had more than five grand in cash which  is very rare i'm paranoid till i get to the bank yeah sure how do you carry 52 mil yeah in quarters  with a lot of big quarters i didn't hear that i hear it's just pocket money pocket money that's  his pocket change yeah uh putin is uh alpha dog we learn yes and uh and uh what's his name over 
[00:30:00]  there in iran is hitler and afghanistan's uh ahmed karzi is driven by paranoia they also say that  putin is not as powerful as everybody thinks imagine it's just his driver's name is paranoia  see he's driven by say it's again taken out of context his chauffeur is named mitch paranoia  no it's paranoia two different names oh silly power is his first name paranoia  he's short for particular because he's very particular boo jim someone's saying you uh you uh 
[00:30:30]  eloped that's why you were in new york really oh really what i have going on there you go  i don't know i i hear no no no no never no what are you crazy there's no way i'm ever getting married  no can't picture anthony eloping with a ladder and flowers and without my weapon on me yeah  yeah you're gonna need your weapon jesus don't voucher the weapon when you're eloping all right 
[00:31:00]  but you did some top secret shit in new york city are you cia you're cia a little clandestine  were there any uh memos out on me what's going on there why clandestine what's going on hey just  you know just uh very mysterious i try to be mysterious you're being very secretive i try to  be mysterious man of mystery and intrigue trying to work out the the jeter contract are you part  of that ah part of that you know i get involved in a little bit of everything i was just in the 
[00:31:30]  in the city certain areas doing lovey-dovey stuff and you just don't want us to know about it  certain places you can't go thank the boys at the 14th wait certain places you can't go  you got to do something cool in new york that's you know some place with uh security  a tourist trap uh could have been so why can't you announce you did a touristy thing just like 
[00:32:00]  you know keeping things on the dl as they say that's all dl it's on the dl  taking notes that's gonna end up on wikileaks  that could be huh it could be why why wouldn't you be able to announce that just i i i know that  just just from things logistics huh that's all that's why it's weird going on 
[00:32:30]  what is that bad it's not i'll leave you alone it's not bad okay  by the way there was a hasidic attack i'm so confused a jewish guy was attacked in williamsburg  beaten by three thugs and the cops said that they think was a biased crime because uh  or the activists because when he offered to hand over his wallet he was punched in the face  they don't identify the thugs though no no i wonder who the thugs are 
[00:33:00]  it's on the bottom of page 10 oh really no i don't know it doesn't say who the thugs are what  they might look like by would you give me a description you can't be upset by the papers  anymore they had the north korean uh conflict on page 22 last week you know as we get closer and  closer to a major problem a major situation they they're still burying those stories as well  you watch any football yesterday uh not a minute of football did i watch well i watched a little vick  yeah giants beat uh the eagles not a giants fan but uh that was the only game i did see some 
[00:33:30]  highlights that were pretty cool i saw a little brawl that was going on there oh yeah a little  brawl was good you saw the fight yeah that was that was a cool clip uh-huh and then of course the  big uh the big uh drop in the end zone we didn't see it here in new york because i don't oh my god  how fucking annoying i don't understand and then i don't understand so you're watching a football game  you commit to a football game uh-huh it's the one o'clock game uh here in new york they gave us 
[00:34:00]  stealer's bills right which is pretty much who cares because the bills are having a horrendous year  but it turned out to be a really good game yeah and now it's four o'clock and they give you a little  past four because the four o'clock game is starting and then i think uh someone finally explained to me  at 4 15 they gotta cut that shit off boom so you weren't we weren't allowed to see overtime here in  new york city uh new york but they were allowed to show highlights of the game why don't you just 
[00:34:30]  put on red zone i don't have the fucking red zone yeah why could that that's right i don't have  fucking red zone yeah oh that's right that's i've heard they showed every every play of course they  did why couldn't they fucking show the uh overtime because it there's a there's a contract where the  nfl allows you to 4 15 to to to you know get the whole game in and at that point they have to cut  it off to start the four o'clock games they don't want to lose audience to the four o'clock games  but you can't that's like giving you a tv show and then cut it off you know cut it off before the 
[00:35:00]  the big grand finale famous jets heidi yeah exactly from years ago so why show the game at all if you're  not even going to allow it to get to the end more great more great fucking treatment by uh by the  sports franchises or the sports organs to fans they don't give a fuck about you at all but they don't  care but they still have coverage this is what drove me nuts of course they stopped the games  and said uh because the contract nfl contract stuff we get we're not allowed to show you any  more of this game great but then they went and showed you the highlights of the game that's still 
[00:35:30]  going on so show the game it didn't make any sense just show the game for the local team what was the  giants going to play is that what it was on another channel uh i guess the giants was four o'clock  yesterday right yeah yeah yeah so what they'll do is they won't allow anything to compete against  the local team so then why show the game at all you can't show part of a program meanwhile you can  buy these packages that show these games it just it sucks man football is getting scary because now  they got the nfl network showing a game every thursday and they're they're getting us used to 
[00:36:00]  paying for football it's going to get to that point again where uh yeah like every thursday we got a  game now but you got to pay for it the jets game thank god it was local so we didn't have to pay for  it it was on you know all the channels my brother out east doesn't have the greatest cable package and i'm  panicking i'm like holy shit are we gonna get to see this game see the game and it was local thank  god but they're getting us uh used to that and you watch next year they're gonna pump it up a little  more with this nfl network yeah yeah you watch the nfl network at all no i don't watch the i don't have  it but because it was a local game i got to see the nfl network coverage if that makes sense 
[00:36:30]  joe theisman's got to be the worst i gotta speak out for everybody holy shit did this guy make it about  himself i'm like you're not playing anymore just fucking call the game just show a constant loop  of his leg cracking exactly exactly but they shut the game down at uh at 4 15 i believe that's  with red zone it's so much easier than i know but i don't i see the files trucks outside my building i  don't know if they're rewiring the building still or if that's people getting files i gotta find out 
[00:37:00]  planting explosives in my building yes files i wouldn't notice if they were planting explosives  in my building i wouldn't have a clue no no of course enough with that i watched i would have a  clue of course i watched the jesse uh ventura uh conspiracy hold on hold on hold on before you  end that wonderful the only reason i brought up the steelers bills uh game this guy is uh unbelievable  he's a big star today steve johnson uh dropped a touchdown pass that would have won the game 
[00:37:30]  right i mean it couldn't have been any easier and he dropped the fucking ball so then he tweets  about it yeah and people were beating me up saying uh he wasn't tweeting to god but yes he was  everybody's saying he tweeted to god so shut your your faces did god he he tweeted this i fake god he  tweeted this i praise you 24 7 and this is how you do me you expect me to learn from this how i'll never  forget this ever thanks though that's what he tweeted yeah and it was to god yeah everyone's 
[00:38:00]  saying it's to god look it does sound directed at god which it was apparently directed at god  no uh no response from god yeah did he did god block him uh god should block him do you know  how many followers god would have on twitter oh my god almost as many as lady gaga almost almost  not quite uh yeah lady gaga would be more popular than god on twitter yeah but yeah you know maybe uh  maybe the guys on the uh the steelers prayed to god a little a little more than you did there sir 
[00:38:30]  someone did get god oh someone got the god yeah and good news for jimmy uh he's got more followers  than god i should i'm funnier than god god's great he makes good planets makes good planets average  people makes great animals god who was smart enough to get god on twitter well damn it god yes  damn it jesus jesus christ he's this guy i know oh jesus i found him a hispanic fella 
[00:39:00]  um oh by the way i said eagles play the giants and someone wants to know if i'm on drugs holy  shit of course they didn't it was the eagles uh bears oh what was i fucking bears holy shit sorry  about that there's the football brawl if you haven't seen the footage of this football brawl  it's amazing yeah doling out some uh fines maybe some suspensions they just keep showing it it's  amazing how the news continues to show it but football fights in general suck because they're  all wearing helmets and stuff this one was a special fight oh the helmets came off unbelievable 
[00:39:30]  they rubbed helmets fantastic i know i mean just what were you saying because just because  tomorrow's gonna be an amazing show it doesn't matter what uh oh oh what what tomorrow yeah i  know yeah i didn't even know until yesterday you didn't know what happened just that tomorrow's  special guest day what's going on around here wonderful day tomorrow and a huge announcement  by the way from me what tomorrow's a very good day i have a huge announcement huge yes well for me 
[00:40:00]  it's huge so mysterious is it a real huge announcement oh yeah yeah it's about a lot of people that  weren't able to get something that may be able to get it now oh because uh chlamydia well that  there's no announcement there just shake my hand get a test i laugh at chlamydia i don't even think  chlamydia would waste its time on me like for what what are you starting what you're starting to say  something i forgot yeah yeah we're all over do that and then and now jd in new york city has more info 
[00:40:30]  the giants were the one o'clock game okay the game ended before 4 15 okay that's when they went to  the bill stealers for bonus coverage oh then they had to get out of the bonus coverage because they  had to start the four o'clock oh whatever they could just leave it on like yeah just leave it just  don't give us the bonus coverage then bonus coverage fucking asses giving us a bonus oh it was a  conspiracy theory right oh jesse jesse jesse jesse yeah he was uh doing the uh jfk uh assassination 
[00:41:00]  finally finally yeah someone was going to look into this oh no people have looked into it before  really yeah wow because according to a jesse boy you just uh it had to come down to him yeah good good  it was they were over dramatizing how this guy uh was getting in and he's gonna get all the info and  he's talking to um uh howard hunt's son uh because howard hunt was supposedly one of the hobos that were 
[00:41:30]  walking behind the fence and that it was every bit of drivel that you've ever heard come out of  conspiracy theorists mouth about the assassination um and then he talks to uh what's his name  bugliosi uh bully bulliosi i'll credit jesse for that though because bulliosi wrote what i think is  the greatest book ever written on the jfk conspiracy and he knows everything about it well jesse just 
[00:42:00]  wouldn't let him talk kept chiming in and and saying like well why don't why didn't uh this person  uh talk to him and and and bulliosi's just just schooling jesse of course he is and uh finally  uh bulliosi was just like shut the camera off because it was getting ridiculous it was getting  ridiculous jesse wasn't letting him talk or anything and jesse of course takes it as ah he 
[00:42:30]  shut the camera off it's like a big deal but it wasn't but bulliosi was not nervous about jesse's  points no jesse's but you had an answer for every one of them it was logical everything made sense  everything jesse jesse had these secretive people that that you know they open cracks in hotel room  doors who's who's there who's there it's me the governor and it's just it nothing new and he made  it sound like everything he was saying was well i guess that proves it no it didn't but you see that's 
[00:43:00]  the way he debates and a guy like bulliosi bulliosi has has shit more information about the jfk assassination  than any of us will ever read he has read ev i'm not saying he has not made any errors he wrote like  an 1100 or 1200 page small font book it's and there's a follow-up cd with more information he has  written and read he's read every fucking ounce of conspiracy bit of documentation he knows everything 
[00:43:30]  about it i mean he investigated the book for 20 years and then he was talking to another guy it was  of course they were his wife and kid and it's like you were like 11 feet from the president when he was  shot and they didn't even talk to you for more than a few minutes that's like there were thousands of  people there what are they gonna do interrogate someone before they really know what's going on  it's all that shit is just i i i'll give shoddy police work things like that well there are so 
[00:44:00]  and even that there are so many things that they quote the uh so many times they'll quote things that  this one said or that one said that seem ominous and in bulliosi's book it's called reclaiming history  yeah he gives the entire quotes he goes you see how they take this piece out of context here  here's what the police chief actually said and it gives you the entire and it puts it in perspective  and you realize it wasn't what he was trying to put across on his dumb dumb edge show no they make 
[00:44:30]  it look like like this was the what like they say it was terrible uh the war and commission was terrible  a nine month it's one of the longest investigations in history yeah it's one of the most in-depth  investigations about anything that's ever happened and gerald ford was part of it and he became  president of the united states uh a return favor oh like everything was and then nixon was involved  yeah and so was earl warren the chief justice of the supreme like who among these guys when you have 
[00:45:00]  all of these people that have legacies and full lives who among them says all right guys  we got to cover this up and the rest of the room goes okay all right who talks to 40 people about  covering it up oh these conspiracy theories are such fucking assholes and then they he had to jump into  the jfk movie shit uh without even mentioning it but he was saying things like it was a coup d'etat 
[00:45:30]  uh and look back into the left i despise when people quote things they say stand down oh we know  that's jfk which is a great movie yeah yeah that's his best wig but when you look by the way buliosi  puts in his book a photo uh it's a photo negative of uh kennedy being hit with the final shot when he's  leaning forward and you can see blood coming out forward it's not coming out right it's it's a momentary uh 
[00:46:00]  a screenshot but it's it's like uh when you look at jfk his head is leaned forward and blood is  coming out and going forward yeah so it's like i guarantee you jesse did not show that fucking photo  of course he did so you think it's uh oswald i do think it was oswald and i was a conspiracy guy  for a long time i believed i read a lot of the conspiracy stuff i believed in it but then little things  happen that debunk it like the house select commission on assassinations in 78 they said that by 
[00:46:30]  definition a conspiracy must have occurred and jesse's all over there oh see they said yeah but  it's like medical evidence didn't say that the only thing that said that was an acoustic opinion  because they did acoustic tests they thought they heard a fourth shot over a policeman's radio but  then they did another test with uh different acoustics experts and they said no that sound  actually came a minute after the assassination and echoes off of fences and there's buildings  around it could sound like it's coming from another direction but that's what it was so uh 
[00:47:00]  so uh the the the uh house like they redid it and michael bodden was in trouble so all of a sudden  michael bodden 15 years after the assassination the the uh what was the chief medical examiner from  new york is just gonna lie yes in front of congress what are you assholes i forgot did we talk to  that ghoul about the he's great yeah yeah he was fucking phenomenal genius well more importantly  jesse ventura's show is just terrific oh it's fantastic do you watch it and and think to  yourself how did this guy become governor yeah yeah i actually do it's like what like how did he 
[00:47:30]  become governor he he kind of had some uh legitimacy back then when he ran for governor it was he wasn't  as wacky now he's just but he's always shaking yeah but i think i'm driving no but i think he was  always wacky yeah yes he because he had the whole shaved but now he's a little mustache but now he  can't cover up his wackiness anymore he can't oh that's look at all the shit coming out of the  front of his head let me see front of his head explodes yeah there's also but that's obviously a 
[00:48:00]  shot from uh the front it does it actually doesn't like a shot from the front honestly it really does  like a shot from the back and it would know a little bit that looks like that looks like a an entry  wound from the back and his whole face is coming apart right top of his head's coming off  jesus uh there's actually a still photo look for still photos danny of uh it's my christmas card  he got such a fucking oh and when when they go through the entire thing of them going to the  hospital and pull up at a parkland memorial and how jackie's just cradling his head and she won't 
[00:48:30]  let people he really bulliously humanizes the assassination because we just look at it like  president kennedy was killed but he really shows you this husband and wife dynamic but because it was  her husband yeah and and while the whole ride to the assassination she's like oh my god they've  killed my husband what have they done she's just talking to him and uh she wouldn't get out of the  car because she wanted people to be away so they wouldn't see his head blown apart and then i think  she opened her hand and there was a piece of his brain oh you know a piece of his head in her hand 
[00:49:00]  and she gave it to the secret service like it was just really amazing amazing job yeah it's really  depressing this witcher yeah all right uh good man that's good oh yeah because you were watching  jesse on that yeah jesse tv i have no desire to watch that show no no i even for the goof at this  point it's all uh goof factor i dvr it so i could go through the commercials because i'm not gonna sit  there and fucking invest that much time into it uh yeah last night was hysterical too with that goddamn 
[00:49:30]  msnbc ratings fest teen sex slaves it's like it's like don't even fucking try to tell me you're doing  some investigative report for the better of society when it was called it was like sex slaves the teen  trade and then they had some it was like three shows all back to back the first one was suburban 
[00:50:00]  teen sex slaves and it was regular american high school girls getting brought into the world of of  sex slavery right here and you know our own little small town usa can i bring it back to that douche  keith oberman of course he was obsessed with getting i'm is fired for the yeah he headed ho right  yep and his own channel when he's not spewing his horseshit is doing the teen sex trade it was expose  you know why obviously i didn't know these people uh i'm watching and that's all for ratings 
[00:50:30]  of course there was a girl i think she was um i think 16 at the time it was three years later  yeah she's like 19 or something like that still a teenager they showed her uh she was talking about  the whole thing uh cute girl talking about being ravaged in the sex slave industry her friend  in high school kind of uh this uh fat blonde chick befriended her and said that her dad has some kind 
[00:51:00]  of cleaning business and would you help me and my dad clean a condominium and and her mother said no  and then she's like well what if you meet the guy and stuff and they came over talking the mother said  the guy was real slick about the whole thing took her to this house gave her one glass of water boom she  was out and she woke up naked just getting pounded guy after guy coming in fucking her sticking a dick  in her mouth in her ass everything and just kept giving her more drugs she couldn't scream she couldn't 
[00:51:30]  do anything jesus she's just and her talking about it so hot where was the girl because i didn't know  anything the friend was walking she said she saw the friend every so often walking outside the hallway  and peeking in on her she was in on the whole thing this guy recruiting these girls for the father  sick yeah it wasn't her father either it was a pimp mike from new orleans writes holy fuck i'm tired  today i was up all night jerking at msnbc msnbc and i gotta watch this show man it was uh and it was 
[00:52:00]  late i'm outraged i was pissed it was late i was like oh god i'm trying to go to sleep what do they  run out of prison shows at msnbc that msnbc knows how to uh put shows they are trying their best to  beat the other news stations well fox news i'm like fuck sorry sorry sean right sorry there  hannity i gotta switch to teen sex slaves in suburbia and we taught people a long time ago  you put that word teen in anything it's so much better it just makes it more gooder it makes  everything better sex slave that's all right teen sex slave oh it was great and it was really hot 
[00:52:30]  because you don't know the people you don't know the people so it's not as um you know not as uh  tragic and traumatic you do feel for the girl you're like oh my god she's got to be fucking  and then the mother's talking about how they rescued her they kind of found this one of the ghouls  pulled up in a car at a gas station with her in the back seat can i ask you something because you're  i mean you're being honest and most most people that watch a show like that would certainly not be 
[00:53:00]  honest how many what percentage of uh let's just go with males that watch a show like that are  actually turned on like this is really fucking i think a hundred percent no very high percentage well  over well over 50 right there's something titillating about the presentation of it  the uh dialogue right descriptions things like that but if you said this yeah people would think  you're you're twisted sick piece of shit exactly yes exactly but but msnbc has to know this that it's  playing up to the fact that this is going to titillate a lot of viewers it was it was presented in 
[00:53:30]  that way really yeah yeah they try they try to can't present it in that way no but it they know  they're doing it you know in editing they can make it very clinical uh but they they add in like  those little things little things that make it like oh she was right oh like like all right the  mother's talking and uh she's saying at the hospital the the chick is so fucked up on drugs that 
[00:54:00]  that's the girl yeah oh nice right do you like that uh the girl is so fucked up that the doctors  think she's just some drug addict prostitute or something it's like no she was kidnapped and and put  in the sex slave for like 10 days and the mother's like she had syphilis of the throat  she had chlamydia she was torn in areas um uh on her um under underside oh and it's just like  sitting there going oh she they shoved dicks in her mouth her ass everywhere it was just oh my god 
[00:54:30]  she had one of the mouth she had like syphilis in her mouth syphilis in her mouth and chlamydia in  her asshole oh all kinds of chlamydia in the ass and what did the pussy have it was just oh forget  about the pussy she was bleeding like crazy and did she have pussy warts she had uh some type of  pussy warts i think i thought we were gonna keep this sexy you fuck uh no it was uh jesus that's 
[00:55:00]  the mother that was so the throat the kid should have listened to i think i saw that bad once  yeah syphilis of the throat yeah they were terrific they were amazing rock down there in the village  yeah yeah and they uh they they they rescued her and and there was other stories about like other  teen uh uh sex slave chicks and then they went to the other one where it was like in detroit or  somewhere and it was just that's just prostitution do the teens uh at least gets you know paid  um no they don't get a dime oh then there was this uh uh older uh not old but older not teen 
[00:55:30]  you know a chubby uh white chick with a blonde hair boom yeah i know i know and she's describing  how she was uh made a sex slave but everything she said but no one wanted her and it chalked up to  her just being a whore yeah like yeah it was kind of um like i'm watching and going like i'm not  buying her story the first girl i bought the story like yeah that that makes sense this one it's like  friends would come over every night and take her out of the house at like midnight she would tiptoe out 
[00:56:00]  go to these places and just get fucked by a shitload of guys and then and then she's like and then i went  out to a car with a bunch of guys and they started pouring booze down my throat it's like did they  were they pouring booze down your throat and i went to some seedy hotel and there were 20 guys  and they were all banging her and then she would just go home and sleep in her own bed yeah yeah  she said that she was so um religious and her family was so religious and the first time they did

[01:04:30]  don't worry about it uh box office harry fucking potter huh yeah that's the biggie although tangled  uh made a run for the for for harry potter's money there and and tangled wasn't i don't think  tangled was supposed to do as well as it did but it did 49.1 million why it's one of those fucking  disney fucking animation i don't think they had high hopes for that not really i don't not this i  mean they knew it was going to do well but yeah they they they didn't think it was gonna um you 
[01:05:00]  know uh make a run for it like it like that good because harry potter's still really really hot  harry potter and you're not gonna see the harry potter movies uh no maybe one day i don't know  i saw a weird movie over the weekend i saw i saw an indie flick oh which was it the kids are all right  all right right right right that's a lesbian lesbian couple yeah that looks really and more making out  with a really old looking annette benning yeah i mean these two were all in being lesbians what's that 
[01:05:30]  about yeah like you you get the you get the the actors that they do their gay role but you know  they're not really in what was the one we talked about milk oh yeah with sean penn where he had what  he agreed to kiss a dude once and then the rest of the stuff had to be in shadows yeah in shadows  because he really didn't want to go all in fucking be making out every two seconds of this movie but  the kids are all right man they were all in making out uh why did i see the movie yes i was bored i got a 
[01:06:00]  kid at home was that like a chick flick or something no i don't no no i've seen chick flicks  but i wouldn't i wouldn't like i wouldn't search them out no it seems like it was a it's an indie film  yeah you got the lesbian couple you got a couple kids there was a sperm donor involved and then  you know the kids all of a sudden decide was it a rom-com what's a rom-com romantic comedy  was it a rom-com no it wasn't uh rom-com rom-com yuck i hate the rom-com i think it was 
[01:06:30]  oh they're terrible chick flicks i think i just go with indie on this one yeah an indie film  so then the kids meet the sperm donor who's just a dude you know he made a few bucks back in the day  and then uh julianne moore starts fucking the the sperm donor because he's the father of her child  but i thought she was lesbo and that's what i was confused by and then annette benning finds out  because there's a little hair on the hairbrush and then there's a big conflict sounds tricky and 
[01:07:00]  then i'm thinking he's gonna die in a motorcycle accident because they kept hinting about how  dangerous motorcycles are a little foreshadowing but there was no foreshadowing he makes his move he  wants a relationship with julianne moore saying we can make this work she's like i'm a lesbo  this is sounding a little chicky dude i gotta be honest with you i'm gonna defend myself i don't  think it's chicky indie movie for me would be a human centipede human centipede that's a fine  movie which i don't think is a chick flick help me out i don't think it's chicky that could be a 
[01:07:30]  little chicky it's indie guys are going chick complete chick it was an indie film and then it  ended with a nice mgmt uh song so to sum it up hoping the movie was fucking horrible uh and then he  makes his move and she says no i'm a lesbo and then uh they they bring uh bring their daughter  to college the lesbos and then the son driving back from college said i hope you two uh work it out  and then all of a sudden the mgm song starts and that's it holy shit it sounds horrid it got great 
[01:08:00]  reviews well of course it would what did uh rotten tomatoes give this thing dude i can't find movies  if someone look if someone wants to suggest a movie for me on demand i would greatly appreciate  it and i i don't need like a a car crash movie i want something a little deeper not chick flicky  you know help me out what should i see that i i i would have never seen on my own in a theater  you're not gonna turn on to uh this uh long holiday weekend which i actually i really love this 
[01:08:30]  movie it's really great love no it's called happy fruit it's called the happiness with uh philip  seymour hoffman and lara flynn boyle it's it's it's kind of old that was great jerking off all  the time yeah dude it was fucking sick was that the one with the uh molester yeah yeah it was great  wait wait wait wait what happiness yeah who's in that philip seymour hoffman lara flynn boyle  that's not uh there's i i forget his name some guy he's in everything like you'd see if you saw his  face you know who he was writing down one guy's molesting his son's friend oh dude it's the creepiest 
[01:09:00]  thing how great was hopping in that he's great i thought everybody did very well in that movie  he's never made a bad movie he's just jerking off a lot talking dirty to this girl really i called  he's calling her really he's calling her and talking dirty but he's too much of a pussy to  really act on it you know like he wants to be this fucking creep and freak and just fuck machine guy  but like you can't do it fuck machine and they're fucking uh and they're like neighbors right yeah yeah  yeah and uh but everything's all intertwined it's really about like these three sisters and like 
[01:09:30]  there are different lives and shit but there's all these weird peripheral characters and there's  a whole just a whole bunch of weird shit going on yeah really cool flick man i wrote it down i'm  gonna check out happiness i this movie i did it was it was just there i mean we could always tell  from the trailer pop that trailer up uh wait you're getting some info aren't you no no no no no i'm  really not you're burying i just know we can always see i didn't have to bring this up we could  always tell from the trailer well what did rotten tomatoes give this 95 positive reviews the audience 
[01:10:00]  gave it 75 oh boy how many from men though oh that's a good question but it's 75 tampons  using the popcorn thing i'm gonna defend this movie as far as chick flick goes i don't think it was a  chick flick it was an indie well imda and it wasn't a rom-com has the uh trailer oh there it is okay  let's hear the trailer you think julianne moore's hot by the way i'm gonna make you real i don't think  dff do you think so either really goddamn commercials huh they they they throw her uh  they throw her at us like she's some kind of sex symbol she's getting a little older now but 
[01:10:30]  yeah she has way too many uh freckles yeah yeah way too many and the skin tone here we go even for  you might be a little too white anthony well i like them pale this she's really pale all right here we go  hug don't be back late i know i know come give us a hug before you go hug she looks good there  that's what she's there for have you thought more about making that call that could really hurt  mom's feelings how can you not even be curious about it each of my moms had a kid with your sperm

[01:12:00]  i'm not i'm not i just keep seeing my kids expressions in your face  really really i feel like he's taking over my family  oh wow okay uh  they just gave the whole movie away  yeah they really are just that's just my face  driving home on a motorcycle  this is something i just never allow  mom i'm 18 years old 
[01:12:30]  i've just felt so far away from you lately  why'd you donate sperm  it seemed like a lot more fun than uh donating blood  hey i'm glad i did  entertainment weekly liked it  two people  that's good  year after year  sometimes you stop seeing the other person  i hate this song  it's an intentional family  now before you kill me 
[01:13:00]  i did say the movie was just there  i didn't i didn't start the conversation saying  i saw an amazing movie  right right right  now now flame away please  i would never say that  i'm just  flicking  i'm looking  you see the one um  from the trailer i'm seeing uh  you see the one  the one quote was uproariously  uproariously funny  right  it's not  it wasn't at all  i didn't laugh much uh throughout the movie 
[01:13:30]  no  and they gave away the entire movie  they really did  the trailer gives away the whole movie  so save yourself and just watch the trailer  it's pretty stupid  two and a half minutes or whatever  i wasn't really feeling that one  no i wasn't feeling that one as anything really  it just kind of laid there  that's what i said  it just laid there  i see that trailer and go like  i don't want to see that  i hate trailers  the way they keep stopping  and what did he say  five o'clock  and then a new song kicks up  you know i hate too when they do this  i hate when they're playing promos 
[01:14:00]  and the promos are answering the announcer's questions  oh yeah yeah yeah  like the announcer will go  we have two channels for the price of one  sweet  they'll play like the movie clip  oh it's so annoying  entertainment weekly says  it's uproariously funny  they did  but it's a movie line  it's a clip from him going  they did  well of course they would  yeah  well who wouldn't know that  it's always slightly off  yeah  i hate that  i hate that 
[01:14:30]  entertainment weekly says  it's the movie of the decade  well i guess uh  someone should have told me  when they try to make the movie talk  yeah yeah  hbo does that a lot  oh i hate that  i don't like that  i hate it  is that a chick flick by the way  i felt it in my ovaries  i'm feeling uh  chickish about that one  i'm feeling chickish  i'm sure it would be uh  more more of a female audience  yeah yeah definitely

[01:19:30]  yourself  is horseshit  stand in front of  the mirror  you're self-centered  whore  there you are  yes  you're in your  room again  i just said  that  i think  women  you say  mirror  yeah  i love  those  i didn't  hear that  we've been  commenting  somebody was  saying we  ought to  just throw  all those  together  during an  i'm not  listening  second  wow  i know  we just  said  mirror  i love  it  do you  do you  like a  woman  rediscovering  herself  no it's  stupid  have you  ever gone  out with  a woman  that is  going  through  a  rediscovering  every  woman i've  ever dated  that's the 
[01:20:00]  reason i get  them in bed  they're trying  to find  themselves  like lay  in front  of a  mirror  you  whore  guys would  never go  and rediscover  themselves  you're gonna go out  with a chick  who's doing  that  i'm gonna  keep doing  it  i just wanna  repeat everything  everybody says  vince from  beyond is  adjusting the  movie for  e-rock  e-rock's  movie is  eat purge  eat  eat shit  fuck it  should be  called  oh by the 
[01:20:30]  way on  wikileaks  they said  if you like  this movie  we're a  faggot  eat suck  and suck  some more  it should be  eat cum  gargle  what uh  julie roberts  were supposed  to believe  that she has  problems in  her life  yeah that she  left her job  to go  discover herself  for one year  well again  it's one of  those roles  like she got  in pretty  woman  yes  oh you got  that  yeah let's  hear this  right let's  hear  what is  that  rediscovery  shit  you're where  y'all are  exactly  look in the 
[01:21:00]  mirror you're  there  i so agree  with you  wow  all right you  should play it  out to them  stand in front  of a mirror you  whore i just  jazzed it up  with whore and  stand  there you are  we do it all  the time  we don't listen  to each other  i like mirrors  you're not  listening but it's  so funny like  guys we're all  guys in a room  so when that  happens you're  just like dude  i just said  that it's like  everyone laughs  i know a girl  is like you know  you see you 
[01:21:30]  don't listen to  me because it  means that they're  invalid and their  points not valid  and they're right  of course you  don't hear me  can we talk  about women  rediscovering  themselves please  that's all i want  to talk about  and in the movies  it always takes  some big giant  trip with this  they have to leave  everything they've  ever known in  life and  it usually involves  fucking somebody  that's shocking  she's pasta she  said i'm gonna be  really bad and she  walks down to the  village and has a  big bowl of pasta  and that's her  rediscovering herself 
[01:22:00]  wouldn't that be  heroin if you want  to be really bad  that's her letting  it all hang out  wow she's gonna  have a plate of  pasta  go to port  authority and  shut your mouth  in front of a  hole in the wall  that's being  bad  that's rediscovering  sure is  not just saying  hi to a friend  yes  how do you do  how do you do  big bowl of  i guess that was  her letting go  i'm gonna eat  pasta i'm not  gonna work to  hell with it  this is like a  foreign world  so that's how  she's like  she lets herself  go by having a  bowl of pasta  the montage  of her and her 
[01:22:30]  friends drinking  wine  gelato  wow she's crazy  did she get  fat  scoops  really  she let herself  go by having  two scoops of  gelato  which isn't as  bad as ice cream  and you watch  this  like wow look  she's eating  and  do you tear up  no  yeah he did  a little bit  how about you  take some dark  cock in every  hole  rediscover that  then you try to  rediscover walking  if you're limping  out of his  harlow apartment 
[01:23:00]  that's looking  dangerously  very good  exactly  have some pasta  to get your  carbs back up  after they're  drained by  dark dick  take the d train  after 10 o'clock  at night  on a tuesday  three multicolored  cocks  some with foreskin  some without  it's all a mystery  it's a hodgepodge  of dark cock  rediscovering  exactly  take two in one  hole  rediscover stitches  when you go to  the hospital  rediscover echoes  whenever you stand  somewhere  so 
[01:23:30]  julia roberts  who's a hot  piece of ass  has problems  and she  fucking let  herself go  with that  and then what  happens  and then it  stops  and then she  goes to the  pray part  pray part  she goes to  india right  so she needs  some spirituality  in her life  after an hour  that stops  nah nah  you can't just  blow off the  fucking india  yada yada yada  this motherfucker  listen  what happens  like does  she go like  out of the  blue  out of the  fucking  blue  does she go  like i'm going  to india  and her friend's  like whoa  what are you  doing  she's like  i'm on a 
[01:24:00]  journey of  how does that  happen  you saw it too  is that exactly  it  why do it  oh cause india  is like  fucking  exotic  and mysterious  and like  you have to be  on a  journey of  rediscovery  to even want  to go  she gets a job  for dell  fucking doing  customer service  we should get a job  climbing on top of  trains and grabbing  power lines  yeah  exactly  on fire  we're fucking  uh  maybe she  she gets a job  fucking putting  a hot and liquid  metal in the eyes  of children  to make them

[01:30:30]  colin furth  laura lini  emma thompson  alan mitchett  rowan atkinson  kira knightley  christmas is a time to be with the people you love  oh this is fucking  a trek  this holiday season  wow  you like this roller  all you need  love actually  love actually  how long's it been out  feast of steam  good king 
[01:31:00]  whence us  last looked out  on the feast of steam  ah hazees  when the snow lay round about  deep and crisp  oh this is fucking  terrible  what was that  shit actually  that's awful  i don't even know what it's about  we just saw the whole trailer  well yeah take everything you know about love  and multiply it by eight  by eight  in my case  eight times zero is zero  eight  eight t-cells 
[01:31:30]  eight ate  it's about pussies  on faces  giant fucking clits  why are we multiplying it by eight  i guess because it's four couples  is that four couples  i was seeing there  oh  why no gay couple  why yeah  why no nine  why no cuckold couple  yeah  why no black couple  yeah  why no interracial couple  multiply it by eight  and add a dark gentleman  and a humiliated husband  that would be nine  prepping the bull  yeah  nine glorious  pink headed inches 
[01:32:00]  see hugh grant  sucking a big black dick  and fucking  keira knightley  getting ready to take it  you're worthless  prepare my bull  get me ready  for a real cock  that looked  so it's a bunch of love stories  terrible  yeah it is  and again  hugh grant just  never disappointing me  as far as being the worst  fucking thing in any movie  he's fucking atrocious  he's a boar  a crashing boar  movies like that 
[01:32:30]  who sees them  his name should be  hugh douche  that's what he is  yes  it's nice to see  liam neeson  without the  soy sauce  in his hair  exactly  the soy sauce  surprise he's not chasing  a fucking  a retard running  daddy a pony  that fucking  hunker shit  you'll never let that  how can you  daddy a pony  clunker clunker clunker clunker  that retarded  what did he bring her  a comb  for you to brush 
[01:33:00]  your hair with  yes  alright so the movie  had some holes in it  that take it  yeah  called pages  the action was great  he pretty much bought her  a horrible mr microphone  cause she wanted to be a singer  and then at the end of the movie  he gets her to the  fucking the real singer  and then we realize  she has no talent  and she runs like a retard  in a circle in the backyard  and leaves like horse trail marks  like you know a horse  walks in a circle  that's what his  cunty daughter did  fucking awful  what happens in this movie  does he break down  and say that he could have  just saved one more 
[01:33:30]  does he make a list  ah there you go  now that's a fun filled movie  I'm essential to the war effort  this christmas  take little hands  to clean the munitions  ha ha ha  Santa has a list  and so did Schindler  this christmas  yeah  we invite you  yes  I didn't know you got  invited to the movies  yeah yeah  we invite you to  yeah exactly  they're inviting you  to the movie  they're not inviting us  if they're inviting you  it stinks  I decline  let me rsbp  fuck off 
[01:34:00]  it should be free  if it's an invitation  hey guys  we got someone calling in  their sister-in-law  is into rediscovery  I want to know  what this rediscovery  really is about  who is this bitch  uh Jim  what do you got buddy  nothing  hey uh  happy birthday Jimmy  yeah  right  my sister-in-law  tries to do this  every time these movies  come out  but she's like  can't fully commit  so she likes to  start eating like  Olive Garden  and going to like  alternative church  and stuff  and it's just really  sick and disgusting  and funny  well getting back  to Eat Pray Love 
[01:34:30]  you think there's  a lot of women  out there now  booking trips to India  because that's  what Julia Roberts  did to rediscover  herself in this movie  and then it doesn't  turn out quite as well  not as well as  all of a sudden  they're in the slums  of India  trying to rediscover  themselves  and they don't realize  that you know  it's movies  and then you know  so they don't have  a lot of money  to do it  they just do it  half assed  and it's ridiculous  and it never works  out like the movies  it never works out  some dumb fat slob  is going to try  to rediscover  herself by going  to India 
[01:35:00]  the age rate  is 90% there  yeah  maybe not the place  to rediscover  your sexuality  yeah it sounds great  until you bring  dysentery into it  and she's shitting  her brains out  from trying to drink  an ounce of water  she goes to the slums  and politely accepts  a glass of water  and it's got toes  floating in it  and fucking  burned out eyeballs  and flecks of paint  she drinks it  to be nice  ah shit  alright right on  alright enough 
[01:35:30]  of that shit  I'd hate to go there  thank you Roland  no one wants to go there  happiness  I'm going to go  check that out  that's great  yeah I'm going to  check out happiness  do you have the trailer  for that one  I'm sure it's a little  different  I'm sure happiness  was fucking hop  and was just a great  dirtbag  that I didn't see  I'm just having a  I'm having a tough time  fucking finding movies  I like  oh this is really  this is 90  Andy  yeah sure  I'm fine  John Lovitz  it's good we had  this talk 
[01:36:00]  yeah  before things went  too far you know  got too serious  is it someone else  it's just you  people are always  putting New Jersey down  but that's just  because they don't get it  I'm living in a  state of irony  how's it going  she only knew  how I felt  she doesn't even  know I exist  I thought of people  who is that  boring person  they think  I've never before  met anyone so boring  sometimes I wonder 
[01:36:30]  if any of your patients  can talk to you  I should tape some  for you  oh Bill  would you  would you really  so I could listen too  I recognize everyone  in this  you do  it sounds like  such a fun  do you want a divorce  did I use the word  divorce  you said that  you didn't  did I use the word  divorce  divorce was the best  thing that ever  happened to me  really  do you like men  it's not so simple  are you lesbian  no  it's alright  I like lesbian  wow hey 
[01:37:00]  that was in the other line  this is 88  I'm a passionate woman  yeah  but I hate  sex  we who have  everything while joy  and what about  our music career  I don't know  but don't hold your back  I know that I don't dare  to end my search  for happiness  that's a terrible trailer  for this movie  terrible  that's a terrible cut  they're trying to get  the girls to come in  I guess  this is probably why  it didn't do any business  at the box office  it's so dark  this movie  yeah dude 
[01:37:30]  it's incredibly  this is a dark movie  it's so incredibly dark  it sounds like the same trailer  to the kids are all like  that with this play  this movie is so incredibly dark  I'm watching it  and like every  I don't know  probably about every 15  minutes I'm going  what the fuck is going on  what the fuck is going on  they made it sound like  a chick flick  I'm sorry  that's a terrible trailer  no it's great  it's such an  inappropriate trailer  it's so wrong  that is not  representative  of this movie  so the people  that should be seeing it  aren't because of the trailer 
[01:38:00]  and then the people  that are seeing the movie  because of the trailer  are very disappointed  that doesn't make sense at all  like  I could imagine  someone's  wife or mother  wanting to see this film  based on this trailer  they would have walked out  within 25 minutes  I wonder if they did that  on purpose  whoever made that  should be fired  if that wasn't purposeful  that was terrible  I said that fucking  12 years later  yeah now I don't even know  if I want to see the movie  you know it's funny here  here's one of the  comments on this trailer  it says  the most misleading trailer ever  oh really  oh wow  see  I'm sure many couples  saw the trailer 
[01:38:30]  saw the positive  critic reviews  and figured it would be  a fun little date night  for them  the shock and awe  this film would bring  to those types of people  cracks me up  I wonder if they did that  on purpose  oh that would be fun  I hope so  because I mean  like the subject matter  that they tackle  in this film  maybe they want to  fly under the radar  or something  I'm very confused by that  I wouldn't surprise me  if such a dark movie  that was just as bad  as the other two trailers  we played  that's the beauty of it  and oh boy  is this a good one  really  and one more  about movies  I guess  there was a movie 
[01:39:00]  this weekend  that I was watching  at home  Tangled  DVD  and I  just stopped  watching it  stopped  fucking watching it  due to complete  lack of interest  can anybody guess?  Grownups  anybody guess?  what?  Grownups  no no no  no  you wouldn't think  it's a movie  that was supposed  to be good  and was supposed  to be something  comedy?  nope nope  like a 
[01:39:30]  drama  fucking  it wasn't a rom-com  no it wasn't a rom-com  how old is it by love?  Brandy New  just came out  on DVD  reception  thank you  I watched the first  few minutes of it  my girlfriend liked it  I didn't see any more  of that movie  did they?  I guess  I completely lost  interest  I'm watching it  and I was really into it  I'm like I wanted to like  this fucking movie  halfway through  I'm like  I could give a shit  what happens  wow  and you're a movie guy  big time  yes 
[01:40:00]  what was the problem?  it  it just lost me  it was  was it too complicated  to follow?  no you know  I don't feel like  I don't feel like  working at it  I just want to watch  something  I was figuring it out  I had what was going on  and everything  but it was like  I just had it  I was like enough  I lost interest  you just saved me  completely lost interest  I'm not even going to  pop that in then  I got my Blu-ray too  alright  maybe I'll take up 
[01:40:30]  at some point  were you drunk or anything?  no I'm always drunk  Jesus  no you know what I mean  were you tired  were you like  what are the circumstances?  did you have some  some teen brunts  in the castle?  no it was just  a fucking  dull  like it didn't  fucking hold me  I felt like the premise  was cool  it was a cool concept  but then in execution  it lost me  because I felt like  a lot of the dialogue  was so forced  to explain to the  the audience  what's going on  and how it works 
[01:41:00]  and stuff  and it just kind of  came off as a little cheesy  that was  that was a big part of it too  weren't the reviews  on that movie really good?  oh yeah  they did pretty well  at the box office right?  what did Ron Tomatoes give it?  out of curiosity  you know and  just being attached  to Christopher Nolan  means it's going to be  the best movie ever made  always  so it's  you know  it's always very skewed  always  and then you got Leo  Leo's always a  fucking  Leo  usually box office  they almost lost Leo  let's calm down a little bit  he was on that flight  that had that engine blow out 
[01:41:30]  they almost lost to Leo  Putin addressed him too  when he got there  because he had another flight  the next flight he took  had to refuel  unscheduled  because they had  such strong headwinds  they weren't going to have  enough fuel to make it  what's wrong with that?  I know it was two Delta flights  in a row  look at this Inception  87 positive reviews  93  the audience 93%  most people love this movie  a lot of people love Avatar too  you know  it's just one of those things  I love the Avatar  never watched that one  all the way through either  shut that fucker right off  you're a tough cookie ant  I am a tough cookie  I like the Avatar  I don't know if I would like it as much 
[01:42:00]  if it wasn't the 3D though  that's your problem  you don't see it in 3D  yeah I didn't see it in 3D  see to me  I don't think a gimmick makes a movie  you know like  either the movie's good or it's bad  and it shouldn't have to depend on the 3D  but it was also a story  we all fucking know  shouldn't either  well without the 3D  it blew monkey ass  I'm just thinking  I don't know if I would have liked it as much  if it wasn't  you know  in that 3D world  hence the gimmicky kind of thing  though right there  no but there's 3D movies  coming out now  that are just pure  you're watching it  because of fucking 3D  yeah  you're like Jackass  the story wasn't that  yeah I could sit through Jackass 
[01:42:30]  in 3D and not 3D  the story wasn't that bad  it wasn't?  not really  I found it  it's Pocahontas  it's all that shit  again  it's a story that's been told many times  bore fest  I'd rather see a guy  shitting five feet into the air  in 3D  oh my god  which was fine  you saw Jackass in 3D?  I was hysterical  it was hysterical  it was really good  my dad  I was talking about that  over the holiday break  and he said something like  oh like in Jackass  in 3D  I told him I saw it  and he goes  he goes 
[01:43:00]  oh is that good  and he's like  let me guess  they play with duty  and I said  do you understand  I'd go see a movie  that was called  if it was called  Playing with Duty 3D  I'd go see that movie  who wouldn't go  who wouldn't  big submarine logs  starring Jimmy Norton  yeah  he had like Doug Flutie  throwing submarine logs  48, 50 yards  did you howl  did you howl  when the dildo  was coming right at your face  I wasn't howling  I thought it was clever 
[01:43:30]  it was very funny  it was really clever  because all of a sudden  it's 3D  and this fucking dildo  is just like wobbling  throwing your fucking face  the fucking theater  I was in  was howling  they were fucking howling  that's some funny shit right there  because it was a wobbly one  just like aww  it's like  where's this thing going  and it's like  oh it's going  the 3D  for that kind of a movie  it's fun  I'm not going to go run  see Avatar  I don't give a fuck  but for a movie like Jackass  it's fun  and just that combined  with the super high speed  camera stuff 
[01:44:00]  so not only is it  super high speed  but it's also  this 3D stuff  it can become  it was well done  I liked it a lot  hey speaking of movies  we should just continue  Leslie Nielsen died  84 years old  yep  ah what a loss  what a loss  and we had him on the show  about 2 years ago  about a year and a half ago  I believe  and people are recosting  our last interview  with Leslie Nielsen  they've been playing  some clips of him  from Naked Gone movies  sure  Airplane 
[01:44:30]  yeah  and Police Squad  forgot about Police Squad  some of the shit  that was going on  it's like  they played a clip  on 1010 Winds  on the way in  where I guess  a bad guy  is getting into  a gunfight  with Lieutenant Drebin  and he goes  yeah I got a message  here from my boss  and he just starts  shooting at Drebin  and Drebin's like  okay but  stop shooting  I can't hear you  fucking classically 
[01:45:00]  classically funny shit  does Airplane  hold up  yeah  if you got  a little buzz on  that's great  so we got a few clips  here we want to play  here's Leslie Nielsen  from a year and a half ago  on the Opie and Anthony show  we'll stop this  as we go  let's welcome  Leslie Nielsen  to the Opie and Anthony show  Mr. Nielsen  how do you do  I didn't know 
[01:45:30]  where you've gone  hello  hi  hi Leslie  how are you sir  are you  well  do you spell my name  of course  L-E-S-L-I-E  L-E-S-L-I-E  right  yes  N-I-E-L-S-E-M  right  of course  I can't get rid of that  oh that'll be  we had to get that  out of the way  that old age is a bitch  oh my god 
[01:46:00]  this is the great  Leslie Nielsen  people wanted to hear this  the big interview  it was very uncomfortable  for everybody  was it really hard  to understand  the black guys  in the airplane  where they had to do  the writing  under their talking  oh Jesus Rich  I'm sorry Leslie  that was Rich Voss  he's an awful  awful person  founder of Amway  I think he meant  comedian  he was an awful  awful comedian  I think they had  the streaming of  what is it  the hero  last night 
[01:46:30]  and it went very well  I think it'll probably  and hopefully  the people  will know the name  that aren't in the movie  you know  superhero movie  sir  exactly  oh you got it  superhero  yes  okay  stroke  drug  or Alzheimer's  oh no  oh no  oh boy  this is painful  this could be more 
[01:47:00]  uncomfortable  than well doggy  well doggy  and then  Leslie can't remember  the actors  that he worked with  oh yeah  do you know  Kevin Hart  he was in the movie  one of the actors  no  how about  Jeffrey Tambor  I don't know  Kevin  Jeffrey Tambor  no  who  Jeffrey Tambor  no I don't know  him either  well he's in the movie  too  Craig these are the people 
[01:47:30]  that are in the movie  that he's promoting  by the way  yeah yeah  back live  he doesn't know  the people  that he did the movie with  what movie was he promoting  superhero  was it superhero  he just started  just doing  horrible spoof movies  because it worked  with airplane  so he just started  doing these horrible movies  that were  takeoffs on  whatever was popular  at the time  and  he was  it was terrible  but this is where  your family has to do  the right thing  and pull you out 
[01:48:00]  of the business  they just gotta pull you out  yeah  Dracula dead  and loving it  oh wow  really  Craig Bjerko  how about Leslie  the great  Craig Bjerko  no  is this Leslie Nielsen  how about  it's an ensemble cast  is what he's saying  Opie  of course you don't do  all the scenes together  yes  I feel bad for that 
[01:48:30]  he's gonna die soon  he's just babbling  like a fucking idiot  well done  the great Nick DiPaolo  Nick DiPaolo  was in that day  laying it right out  I feel bad for this  fucking guy  he's gonna die soon  he's gonna die soon  he's babbling  like a fucking idiot  well he made another  year and a half  look  yeah  I gotta bring this up  Danny just popped up  the cover of the  1990 blockbuster movie 
[01:49:00]  Repossessed  which of course  is the spoof on  The Exorcist  with Linda Blair  Ned Beatty  and Leslie Nielsen  wow  is that a blockbuster dude  um  let me see who else  was in that one  it did about  look it did 1.3 million  shit that's a lot of money  1.3 million  box office  that's $1990 
[01:49:30]  it's actually 1.4 today  yeah  oh god  should I get an ice cream cone  oh cause she's cold  no probably Lick Me  oh Lick Me  oh very good Danny  wow look at that  that's like an IQ test  it looks like cloth  where you gotta figure out  what they're gonna say  it looks awful  wow  how did they  how did they get  Linda Blair to do it  in 1990 Linda Blair  was like  the devil  fucking Rick James  I think  I was cracking up  over this movie  oh you found it funny 
[01:50:00]  Chip  I love this one  yeah I bet  devil's all crazy  devil's all crazy  he's like  oh I'm saying  back to our  last interview  with Leslie Nielsen  the Nick DiPaolo thing again  you're not part of  the ensemble  you're part of  I feel bad for this guy  he's gonna die soon  he's just babbling  like a fucking idiot  well the  how  that's gonna make me laugh  like a fucking idiot

[01:51:00]  first of all  because it's Nick  and he's dead  that's why  and now he's dead  and he was babbling  like a fucking idiot  I think  I think for me  the funniest part of that  is because it's like  Leslie's on the phone  it's not like he's hitting  some kind of mute button  like he's just basically  telling Leslie Nielsen  that he's babbling  and he's gonna die soon  oh fuck  I feel bad for this guy 
[01:51:30]  he's gonna die soon  he's just babbling  like a fucking idiot  well the  how about Sarah Paxton  she's just terrific  how about who?  Sarah Paxton  holy shit  well how about her?  well she's in the movie  yeah  hubba hubba  hubba  she's a hubba hubba  you know  hubba hubba  and what's  it's nice to have  a hubba hubba  and I see Simon Rex  he's a terrific actor  what does he do  for the movie?

I do them all  I hate phone interviews  this is very uncomfortable  oh yeah  my  me  you mean  me?  Leslie discusses  working with  OJ Simpson  so I'm sure he had a lot  to say about that  right?

[02:00:00]  cause I didn't say shit  I was playing poker  alright  he's still mad at you  and you weren't even  part of that  exactly  I did kind of  lay into Leslie  a little nasty there  as far as him  being dead  alright  we're gonna take a break  I think D.L. Hughley  will join the show next  good  for me and Anthony  show on the virus  Sirius XM  I nearly lost you there 
[02:00:30]  and it's taken us somewhere  I nearly lost you there  let's try to sleep now  screaming trees  waiting for D.L. Hughley  to stop by  and say hi  he's playing  Carolines this weekend  a lot of shows  at Carolines  this weekend  coming up  wow he's promoting 
[02:01:00]  early huh  he's probably got  a lot to do  in New York City  it's Cyber Monday  Cyber Monday  alright  Black Friday  Small Business Saturday  they were calling that  that sounds like  something they're trying  to slip in on us  yeah  yeah you're supposed  to go to  your local  why wouldn't you do  your Black Friday shit  on Saturday  the crowds were less  on Saturday  than Friday 
[02:01:30]  and you got the same deals  the deals aren't  going anywhere  oh no you gotta be  the crazy person  that like  stands there waiting  although they didn't  have any of those  big door buster  things this year  did they  too many people  have been  too many people  killed over the years  they finally learned  their lesson  crushed between a glass  door  although I see that  thinning of the herd  I really do  you should have that  every year  yeah  you have any of those  Black Friday people  in your family  no no no  no  they camp out all night  just to save  ten bucks on a Nintendo 
[02:02:00]  it's my sister Dawn  but that's because  she's working  oh really  she has to work it  yeah  she had to leave  Thanksgiving dinner  a little early  because she's like  we're opening the store  like midnight  or some shit  yeah that's the new thing  they open it  Thanksgiving night  lame  instead of starting  on Friday  so today's Cyber Monday  but won't the deals  be just as good tomorrow  of course they will be  of course they will  so why does everyone  fall for it  do they want to be  part of something  yeah  they want to be  part of the excitement  they want to be  part of the excitement  part of what  everybody's talking 
[02:02:30]  about  yeah Black Friday  oh I went  oh I was there  I went to the mall  I'm sure  I'm sure you were  driving the LIE  over the weekend  did you see the lines  for the exits  for the malls  why would you put  yourself through that  yeah you got away  through like  literally  20 to 25 cycles  of lights  at the top of the ramp  just to get into  the mall parking lot  and then that's  a whole new disaster  why would you do that  I don't get it  yeah it would just  make me mad  it's not worth it  I would just be angry 
[02:03:00]  and then walking  in the mall  is another thing  I don't mind walking  in the mall  because I like people  watching and all that  shit but getting  to that point  you can't even do that  like on normal days  maybe but when you  get behind the line  of people that are  just not moving  then you get crowd  standing in the middle  of where everybody  is supposed to be  walking  that annoys the piss  out of me  and then dummy  that just stops  in the middle  of everybody  to start talking  on the phone  wouldn't you move 
[02:03:30]  over to a wall  you would think  just move to the sides  get the fuck  out of the way  he's the most  important person  that just goes to show  there's nobody  more important  than that person  they're the most  self-centered asshole  just like think about  I'll always kind of  look behind me  see if somebody's there  before I stop  to look at something  or move to the side  of the big giant hallway  that somehow three  people could take  a full thing  old people doing  that little stroll  move over  walk single file 
[02:04:00]  you fucking life hogs  I can't get past you  and then you try to  like ease on to the left  and and it seems like  that person is actually  moving in front of me  I didn't realize we were  doing our Black Friday  break  hate it  you're right Jimmy  yeah  Black Friday  all good  just  yeah  just  I think Patrice  was good  doing that  yeah a lot of  a lot of  rave reviews  coming in  same fucking people  make your life 
[02:04:30]  difficult  what's going on  I can't say  I'll just say  it's the same  fucking people  every time  are you holding  the fish in the boat  this time now  is that what it is  what does it have to do  I'll tell you later  it's just the same  fucking  situation  every time  oh when he spits  that's really bad  Jimmy only spits  when he's really mad  it's dealing with  incompetence 
[02:05:00]  and uh  no no not incompetence  oh I'm sorry  I was talking about me  I got a  I got one nod so far  I'm going for the second nod  the second nod  it's like a game show  no  oh  not at all  I gotta cross that out  yeah I crossed that out  really well  so this  okay that's it  you got it  you got something in  no no I have no clue  who 
[02:05:30]  I don't know  I was just looking at  those new um  Roosevelt Island trams  yeah they look beautiful  did you see them  they look futuristic  now  awesome  um  is Fez going to take those  you think he'll take those  from Retard Island  how's Fez doing  I don't know  I haven't heard  hey so uh  then you get to the mall  then you get in one of the stores  yeah  and then uh  you see the line  just to pay for something  and then I  that's a  at that point  and more idiots  by the way  if I ever get to that  point  that's the final point  and I just leave the mall  and go why 
[02:06:00]  what was I thinking  to get involved  with this crap  you even think about  buying a few things  and then you look and go  what am I going to stand  on that line  just to pay for one  dumb stupid sweater  for somebody that will  never wear this dumb  stupid sweater  because you feel like  you got to buy them  something stupid  because it's Christmas  thank god  we went through  the uh  thing  my family  went through this thing  where now we just do  the one present  for one person  the secret Santa  kind of thing  because we used to  get presents  for everybody  everyone got some  they're like 
[02:06:30]  so I'd have to go out  and shop for 20  fucking 25 people  but in your family  is it like the lottery  when someone  uh  when  when you pull  someone's name  and they're like  oh yeah  well no  because they put a limit  on it now  it's like  ah  you know  a couple hundred bucks  you don't pay attention  I go a little over  that's why they get excited  when you pull their name  yeah  no grab bag  well people wanted to  uh  people were very excited  when I first  you know  started getting a little  successful in this business  and uh 
[02:07:00]  everybody  sure  was getting presents  so it was like  oh good  and then they went  to secret Santa  and everybody was like  ah fuck  can we do some  on hold music  I really need to know  what is bothering Jimmy  some what  some on hold music  like we used to do  is that just  it just compels you  to know  I have to know  don't you have to know  is it just  no  I can find out  I can find out  he's  I can find out  at some point  he's smoking right now  oh I know  he's fuming  how do we do anything  he's TCB right now  he's taking care of business 
[02:07:30]  I love this by the way  we'll be right back  on my own I believe  What's wrong with you  I love this by the way  I love this at the end of the day  where you feed me  the way  what do we do  yeah  I love this by the way  yeah  and there be this by the way  let us know  I love this by the way  and we see  how are you  I love this by the way  We'll be right back. 
[02:08:00]  That song runs out really fast, doesn't it?  It ran out right after that word.  Abrupt ending.  Right after that naughty word that Jimmy used.  Oh, my God. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, no surprise.  From what I hear, penicillin still takes care of it.  Yeah, Jimmy is annoyed.  Livid.  I don't blame you.  It's just whatever.  Same fucking thing every time.  I don't blame you.  By the way, that was a great coincidence because Chuck Mangione, it's his birthday.  It's my tribute. 
[02:09:00]  Happy birthday, Chuck Mangione.  The big seven all.  We didn't know we were going to play Mangione today.  Toodly-doo-ly-toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Let's say hi to Jimmy in Staten Island.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Good morning, boys.  How are you?  Good, Jimmy.  Listen, my wife was one of those fucking clods that woke up my twerk.  Claws.  I wanted to be there when the doors opened.  When someone's a clod. 
[02:09:30]  Fucking.  And I had to be stuck home with my son.  And I had to be working at night because I'm in the car business.  Yeah.  So all I heard was, everybody's working bell to bell on Friday.  It's black Friday.  Fuck you.  Who's going to have to buy a fucking car?  Do you want to buy a fucking car?  Fuck you.  All right, there's a couple things.  You're calling your wife a clod.  And I would assume when you fell in love with your wife many years ago, she wasn't a clod.  No.  When did it turn that she was a clod?  Well, you see, marriage is a very funny thing, I have to say. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, hysterical.  And after the dress comes off, a couple of months go by, they turn into inflate a bride.  That's when they gain the fucking weight.  Inflate a bride.  Inflate a bride.  So your wife got fat on you?  Sounds like a good business to get into.  Listen, my brother was this show, you're going to dig a hole for me, all right?  Yeah.  So yeah, so she put a little weight on.  I've taken weight off. 
[02:10:30]  You've taken the weight off, and she turned into a clod.  I'm on the Vegas diet, buddy.  Stress, aggravation, and grief.  You know?  I hear you.  So she woke up at 4 a.m. to be part of that Black Friday mess.  Yeah, those fucking tools.  Why do people do that?  And I know I'm talking to a few people that did that.  Why?  Did you guys catch that Walmart, YWid Online, were open all night, you know?  I guess they wanted to avoid the fucking trampoline here.  Yeah, yeah, that's what they're trying to do now, because everybody is suing. 
[02:11:00]  So they try to just leave the store open all night long, so there isn't that big stampede  when they open the door.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You spend hours on the fucking gift for two minutes, ribs on rapid, throw it to the fucking  side, and never use it.  I'm sure some store in some small town will do it.  I don't blame this guy for saying fuck Christmas.  You don't like it?  We all forgot the true meaning of Christmas.  What was it?  Sleeves didn't.  Is that his name?  Oh, no. 
[02:11:30]  I fucking love Sleeves.  Not that God fucking awful thing.  I think it's time for the Sleeves Christmas song.  What's wrong with you guys?  With that awful...  I think Jimmy needs Sleeves Christmas song.  Jimmy's not happy right now.  I hate it.  Because the same people are fucking up his world.  I hate...  And I think Jimmy needs to understand the true meaning of Christmas.  Oh, God.  Fuck, I hate this song.  You shouldn't.  I was feeling pretty good for la la la. 
[02:12:00]  Taking my time on the la la la la.  Snow falling down in the la la la la.  Everybody's singing like la la la la.  Taking all the hard with the la la la la.  Making my way to the la la la la.  Shut up.  La la.  Fuck yourself.  I like to drink a little beer. 
[02:12:30]  To hit the end of the day.  We're all walking in the town.  You're like a million miles away.  Now the snow is like a sea.  Like a sand above the beach.  The lights walking in the trees.  The people shining in the street.  And the people in the light.  All the children in the light.  Singing holy, holy nights. 
[02:13:00]  Come on in.  Get into it this year.  It's hard.  I'm feeling pretty good for la la la la.  Taking my time on the la la la la.  Snow falling down in the la la la la.  In the la la la la.  Taking my time on the la la.  Taking all the hard with the la la la la.  Making my way to the la la la la la.  Mean.  La la la la la la.  Doesn't make sense, you fucker. 
[02:13:30]  La la la la.  At least let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.  You know, it's happening.  It's snowing.  What's a la la la?  I don't think I'm out of pain.  It's a feeling.  No, it's not.  He doesn't have words.  He didn't have words.  Don't bullshit a bullshitter.  It's the true meaning of Christmas.  No.  It's a feeling you get. 
[02:14:00]  That we all forgot about.  Is that what the la la la is?  Yes.  All the people in the light.  La la la la means what you want it to be.  People in the light.  They're not in the light.  Terrible.  Holy night.  D.L. Hughley in studio.  Very nice.  Hi, D.L.  D.L. smells very good, by the way.  He always smells very good.  What's up, D.L.?  Saved by D.L.  What's up, brother?  That awful Christmas song was terrible.  How do you dress so fine this early in the morning, D.L.?  I slept in this. 
[02:14:30]  We'll get into the sleeves thing another day, but I'm so glad that it's here again.  Christmas song.  And I want to turn you on to a video he made.  Oh, did he?  To that song?  It's a winter video.  Wow, what are you wearing?  That is some good shit.  It really is.  Very good color.  What is that?  You probably don't want to say.  It's called Black Afghano.  I swear to God.  Really?  You know what?  It has the same properties as hashish.  That's why you hype heads.  That's why everybody likes it. 
[02:15:00]  Hashish.  I got some new cologne, and I'm leaving rehab.  Black what?  Black Afghano.  Afghano?  Afghano.  That's some good shit.  That's hardcore.  How you guys been?  Good.  Oh, we're on.  Yeah, we're on.  I know.  We get asked that so many times because we just heard an insult.  Who the fuck is just hanging out?  The show is pretty much the same when the mics are off, on.  We're in the bathroom.  It doesn't matter.  You can't tell, man.  It doesn't even matter.  I keep smelling my hair. 
[02:15:30]  I know.  Damn.  Black Afghano.  I'm going to have to get some of that.  Oh, yeah.  That's hard to explain, though.  Can I have some Black Afghano?  I wish my wallet smelled like DLs.  Nice and full.  Oh, man.  Are you still doing?  You were doing 97.  Are you still doing a morning show or no?  We're going to come back.  I had to go to court.  You know how that goes.  Wait, you had to go to court?  Yeah, you know how syndicators, it was a weird situation.  Oh, somebody trying to pull shenanigans?  Oh, they pulled some.  Never go into business with somebody who has a van that their syndication office is out of. 
[02:16:00]  Okay.  They sell t-shirts and syndicate radio shows.  Words to live by there.  Yeah, yeah.  It's spectacular.  Wait, what happened?  Steer clear of that shit.  It was just they didn't ever have the money to do the show.  Right.  But I signed the contract and then they wouldn't let me out.  So you're trying to get your money.  Yeah, but that ain't going to happen.  So you were trying to get your money, then you tried to get out of the contract, they won't  let you out of the contract?  Then we had to go to court.  So you're not getting paid, but you can't leave the contract? 
[02:16:30]  What?  Right, right.  That's radio for it.  You know what?  It made me miss BET.  There's no surprise there.  That is radio.  Radio is the worst kind of people I've ever been around.  Thank you.  That's terrible.  Thank you.  Terrible.  Bravo.  Why is that?  I don't know.  I think that you would think, and I work for everybody.  I work for BET, I mean everybody.  The radio people are the worst human being.  I'm just on a level, on a very, just a basic level, human beings. 
[02:17:00]  We're the scums of entertainment.  That's how we're looked at.  We've been in the business long enough to have seen every type of shark, scumbag, fucking  parasite.  And I'm like, wow, you can just, you can just, you're not.  You can just do that?  Right.  Exactly.  You don't even feel bad.  You're just going to look me in the eyes and fuck me.  Go to court.  Yeah, yeah.  And sit in the court.  The only, when it turned was, he didn't go to court, because you can't get on the stands.  There ain't no shit like that.  So, obviously you want to move on, but you want to continue doing radio. 
[02:17:30]  I loved it.  I loved it.  You know, I didn't necessarily like, you know, the apparatus.  I don't like the PPM and, you know, and people turn to, you know.  That's all horseshit.  Yeah, yeah, rating.  But I did like the immediacy of it.  I like to, I like seeing something.  I don't like taking complaints from people.  Like, I don't really care.  Yeah, yeah.  Fuck that.  We do it out of your house, or are you actually here in the news?  I would do it out of the house.  And I actually, I've been living here since CNN.  So, I, and I really dig this city a lot, man. 
[02:18:00]  I like this, I like the CNN show, too.  Yeah, I like it, too.  I've gone from that, unfortunately.  We, we're doing a new thing.  You're doing a good job.  I had a good, you know what?  I, I've been fired for more jobs than I like.  You just get used to it after a while.  After a while, you're like, oh.  Yeah, I hear that one.  But, uh.  No surprise with the radio thing.  It really is just.  How about the ratings where all of a sudden, in one month, they go, oh, man, your, uh,  your audience dropped 33%.  Right, right.  Yeah, out of nowhere, 33% of the people are going to say goodbye to you.  Right.  And then the next month, it all comes back.  It's like, oh, and those people decide to come back. 
[02:18:30]  They went on a cruise together.  And these dummies down the hall don't understand how that shit works, and they'll, they'll beat  the shit out of, uh, over.  I just didn't understand what the meetings were about.  Like, I never.  Oh, God.  What'd you guys meet about?  Meetings.  I didn't get, I would fall asleep.  Aren't they?  Yes.  Because it, because it's people that have to justify what they do.  But, you know, it's funny.  I wasn't getting paid, so I don't really give a shit what you say to me.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, I'm here.  This is the charity thing.  How long into it did you realize there was a problem with the funds?  Um, and then they paid everybody but me. 
[02:19:00]  They paid my co-host.  They paid the, they paid everybody but me.  And so I would say about three months in, I realized.  You were like, there's something.  You know, because you, you, you, you, you've done television before.  It could be a couple of months before you get a check.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Give them a little leeway.  Yeah, it could be.  And they're all lying bags of shit.  Entertainment, anyway.  No, no, we wrote it out.  It's coming.  I'm so used to motherfuckers lying.  I just kind of went, oh, okay.  Is the case still going on?  Uh-uh.  We just settled in.  Good, good.  So what was, what was their excuse for not paying you?  They didn't have one.  He's DL.  He's got enough money. 
[02:19:30]  So what would they say?  We'll pay you eventually?  Well, no, they would say that the other station, the station didn't pay, they didn't sign the deal.  They were just a bunch of lying, dude.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  They would get the money from the syndicator.  They were the worst.  And the syndicator would filter you through the station.  They would say the station didn't give us the money for that.  Right.  Well, the syndicator would say we.  They wanted money for inventory.  Yeah.  They wanted money for inventory that they didn't get.  They wanted to get paid, but they didn't want to pay me.  It was just an ugly.  Wow.  I had no idea. 
[02:20:00]  So it was the bad.  The syndicator was the bad guy.  Yeah, and they were, and I thought these brothers, they'll be cool.  It was the worst.  It's the worst.  Now do you see what we've been saying?  I got it now.  I can't stop saying it when I know so many.  That's all I'm saying.  Yeah, let me tell you something.  You'll go on to another radio job.  Yeah.  Guess what?  It never gets better.  Yeah.  I'm telling you right now.  You always think the new people would be better, and it never happens.  I actually never think that about it.  You know what I mean?  Ever.  I think that...  Well, that was a mistake I made.  I had hope.  Really? 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  That people would do their job?  That people would do the right thing.  Hope.  That was the biggest mistake I've made in my career.  Thinking they would do the right thing.  The only thing I had a problem with, I've never not gotten paid.  Right.  Eventually.  Now, I've always gotten paid, but never, you know, you fucked up people, and they do horrible  shit, but at the end of the day, you get your check, and you go, whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  But never had it been...  This time, the people that I worked around, the immediate group of people were spectacular, but the  the people, the syndicated were fucking terrible, but I never got paid, but I loved working 
[02:21:00]  with the people, and I loved doing the medium.  And then every once in a while, they say, we wonder about your commitment.  Bitch, I'm here for free.  What kind of commitment?  Wow.  It can't get better than that.  That's fucked up.  I flew here.  I keep an apartment here.  You got me for free.  Right.  Don't question my commitment.  I bought a car to come here.  Right.  It's the only reason people sit in front of the microphones and babble into it for hours on  end is because it's a cool-ass job.  It is a cool job.  You get a group of people you like.  It's a lot of fun. 
[02:21:30]  And the management end of it, or the fucking business side of it, is the thing that just  is like, can't we just realize what we're doing here and not treat it like we're building  a building or something?  And then there was an advertiser that came in.  And he was doing, this group happened to be doing a campaign about, you know, if you  buy this bucket of chicken, we'll donate money for you buying this to breast cancer. 
[02:22:00]  And I was going, wow, if you don't eat this shit in a bucket, you probably won't get it.  You probably won't get it.  Exactly.  And what, you just ran in.  Wait, you can't do that.  Wait, you can't.  That's a sponsor.  Boss, what are you doing?  Yeah, the sponsors don't have sense.  Yeah, right, right.  Especially when you say their product gives breast cancer.  Sponsors tend to back off on that one.  They should have a sense of humor.  Yeah, they, yeah.  You're eating the chicken out of a pink bucket to begin with.  They should have a sense of humor.  And then, nobody, like, you got to fly now. 
[02:22:30]  I mean, this dude, I wouldn't even mind, I don't care about the security measures, if  they were actually effective.  Yeah.  Like the patent that they're looking for, the explosive compound.  Patdown, it can't be detected by either Patdown or the machines that we're using.  So now this dude is just fucking damn near raping me in the thing.  With nothing.  Like the most modern civilization known to man.  And I'm in a line with my shoes off and my dick out.  I don't get why that.  And what could I, like, what could I have under my dick that would bring down a plane?  Probably a lot more than we could have under our dicks. 
[02:23:00]  And if I, and if I could put something under my dick that, you know, I would put an extra  bag under there so I wouldn't have to pay that fucking baggy fee.  Fucking crazy.  Fucking dynamite.  How about not having to pay this $75 for an overweight bag?  You fucking crazy.  I love how they figured out how to make you pay for bags for a flight you're paying for.  Right, right, right.  That's just amazing to me. 
[02:23:30]  I've had my bags cost more than the flight I was playing.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But how do they get that past us?  I guess we can't, you know.  Remember they charge you for blankets, for everything.  See, I sit in first class.  I like for them to close that curtain because I don't like all that suffering back there.  It's hard.  Hard to hear people screaming.  I can't believe.  I couldn't fly coach again.  That's like fucking Quint from Jaws where he's like, I'll never put on a life jacket again.  I'm like, I'll never go and coach again.  I saw a friend of mine. 
[02:24:00]  Hadn't had anything to eat the entire flight.  Just terrible.  Couldn't go to the bathroom.  Yeah, all the men go into the water.  Yeah, first class is the shit.  And that's shitty, too.  First class is very shitty.  It's not like the old days.  I really do yearn for time, and contrary to popular belief, it was before my time, where  people were just on there and it's like, ah, everybody's in a suit and tie and they're  smoking.  Yeah.  It's real cool.  And you could reach over and pinch his sexy Stu's ass and she'd just turn around and go, 
[02:24:30]  oh, and wag her finger at you and bring your martini.  Like everything, nothing mattered.  A fight could break out in the back.  Like, they'd just break it up somehow and no one's getting arrested, no one's hijacking  anything.  No one's jumping off, cussing everybody out, getting off, hitting the slide and grabbing  a six-pack.  Yeah.  Some fucking chick is up front talking to the pilots and getting wings on her, big tits.  You know, they'd pin some wings on her.  Hey, bring that girl back.  They were like rock stars up there. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  You know the girl in 3C?  Yeah, bring her up to the cockpit.  You ever been on Virgin Airlines?  Yeah.  That's the coolest airline.  Yeah.  It's like, these motherfuckers are selling weed or something.  Oh, the purple lighting, yeah.  Oh, man.  That is a good airline.  Everybody got a little black.  Like, does you just feel like you leave the club?  White chairs, like white leather chairs.  Wow.  Virgin America or Virgin Atlantic?  Virgin America.  Okay, yeah.  Yeah, Virgin America.  That goes back and forth.  Yes.  L.A. New York.  Yeah, and now it's going everything Boston.  Is it really?  It's going to San Francisco.  Yeah, L.A. New York is great on that one. 
[02:25:30]  They'd expect it.  I'm like, wow.  And the pilot, you can't even tell he's a pilot.  It just looks like some hungover business traveler.  Yeah, and he, like, comes out and does the little thing.  He's like, yeah, we're going to be flying some motherfucker.  Right, right, right, right.  He does his own announcements from the front of the fucking aisle.  Right, right.  With a megaphone.  Yeah, with a little megaphone.  He's just like, hey, how you doing?  I just think that coach people should be instructed not to make eye contact with first class when they're walking on.  There is a thing you have to do.  Like, you can help them.  Like, they try to look at you like you can get them something. 
[02:26:00]  I actually, I'll actually do this.  I'll actually have a paper, and if one of them looks down, I'll actually ruffle it.  I like getting on first first so I could get my Bloody Mary right away.  And then I put my earbuds in, and I'm listening to music, and I'm reading, and I'm sipping.  And then I'll just slowly give that little glance up, like, keep moving.  Keep fucking moving.  And then you see people with their ticket.  Right.  And right when they walk in the plane, they start looking at your eye. 
[02:26:30]  I was like, no, no, no.  Don't even bother looking yet.  27K is nowhere around here.  You, way back there.  If it's not a one through four, just fucking look in the back.  You're breathing my air, stink bag.  You don't want them to use your bathroom.  You know?  I love when they come up, and the flight attendant's like, ah, ah, back there.  Yeah, motherfucker.  Back there.  It's got chandeliers in it up here.  How about when one of them makes it through?  I've never been closer to being a snitch.  I want to go, do you fucking see that? 
[02:27:00]  Could you please get them out of our bathroom with their sticky coach food shits?  I want first class dumps only.  And they're using our baggage space.  Is this really necessary?  That's another thing.  Yeah, they try to snitch a bag in it.  Yeah.  Not if I'm on fucking watch.  No way.  When they try to get in the first class over in the compartment.  Even though I can't be here, something on my purse is going to actually be in first.  Nah, everybody.  Don't they know those fucking bins are lined in chinchilla in first class?  We don't want them finding that out. 
[02:27:30]  It's beautiful.  You know what happens to me all the time when they say first class boarders?  They always go, sir.  I said first class.  They do that to me all the time.  Really?  All the time, sir.  This is first class.  Bitch, I can hear.  Obviously, you belong.  Yeah, right, right, right, right.  I don't know what you call yourself.  Look, buckwheat.  We have no one.  And then what happens to me all the time, I'll sit next to some old lady and we'll get  in the middle of the flight and she'll grab her purse.  Like, all right, bitch, we 30,000 feet of women.  Grab your purse and jump off. 
[02:28:00]  What the fuck am I going to do?  And then they always ask me questions like, every time something happens with the president,  I'm always like, and I'm on the plane.  All the expert.  They always go, like I was on a plane, they go, he's going over to India.  Why would he go over to India?  I'm like, India is a trillion dollar economy.  India is, between India and China, they underwrite, what, 60% of our debt?  This ain't just like a poor country where Haji from Johnny Quest came from.  This motherfucker's going to see his landlord.  And you'd rather go see the landlord than have him. 
[02:28:30]  The people don't realize, between India and China, what, China is going to be, Mandarin  is going to be the universal language of commerce, pretty sure.  Yeah, they're really, they're loving capitalism.  They're not fucking around.  I mean, and that could be hard to negotiate with.  You ever tried to get an extra pack of soy sauce on one of the motherfuckers?  I know.  I've got a wheelbarrow full of rice.  One, you can have all the duck sauce you want, but one pack of soy sauce?  And mustard, come on.  Just stop ordering it.  They'll write their answer down, it'll just look like somebody spilled something on the 
[02:29:00]  paper.  What the fuck is that?  Who reads that shit?  Up and to the left and down?  It's like Hollywood squares with a hat on it.  Fucking drivel.  And then, like, when I hear all these people, I want my country back.  Well, I'm sure China will sell it back to us at a reasonable rate.  Yeah, at a reasonable rate?  You're fucking crazy.  This hasn't been our country in 35 years.  Shut up with that shit.  They own our shit.  Right.  A good thing is, I want to see what happens with North Korea, because China is too embedded 
[02:29:30]  now into the capitalist system of the world.  Right.  They can't be defending some little commie country that is the renegade.  So, it's not like anyone has to really worry that much about China anymore when it comes  to North Korea.  No, because they just like money.  Yeah.  China discovered money.  Yeah, when we were growing up, they loved communism.  Yeah, fuck that.  And they loved power and communism and hated the Soviets, and they were banging heads.  And now it's like, they're communists, but you know what?  But they fucking love business.  They love ... When we were growing up, everybody used to be gangbangers, but then they started 
[02:30:00]  making money selling dope, and they went, fuck it, you know, this color shit don't matter.  You know, and so they would just start hustling, and that's what China ... China's like, hey,  you know ...  Yep.  You know, Mao, all this seal marks, I get it, I understand, I think it's great.  Pretty much fuck comedy.  Yeah, but I like ... I want a car.  Do you think China ... Do you think China likes when North Korea lobs shells into South Korea  and it affects the market?  No.  Do you think China's like, hey, motherfucker, now you're taking money out of our pockets here.  Right.  Enough.  Like, in the old days, it was good, yeah, and they'd start rattling the sabers, and there's 
[02:30:30]  not going to be a million screaming Chinese ...  How does North Korea even have any money?  Like, they don't even ... Who has the strength from not ... They're starving ... Who has  the strength to push the button that launches the fucking bomb?  Yeah, it's like, I'm exhausted.  Right.  I can't even do this.  Right.  They just ... Their whole economy is based on threatening the world, and then making ... Us  making concessions, giving them money.  They shut up for a while, and they're like, hey, we're kind of out of money.  Right.  All right, let's do it again.  Let's fucking do some shit again.  So they're the Jesse Jackson of countries. 
[02:31:00]  The Rainbow Coalition.  They come on the job sites.  All right, motherfuckers, we want some jobs.  Yeah, they're pretty much the Rainbow Coalition of the world.  I was doing a gig ... You know, I remember when ... Because I'm always ... They asked  me about Dr. Lord.  I remember she said nigga 11 times.  Sure.  And it would crack me up was that everybody ... I can't believe she said it 11 times.  Like, the first two or three niggas was okay.  It was okay.  Then you went over the nigga limit, didn't have nigga rollover men.  It's okay.  But I was telling that joke at a gig, and I had a gig in Florida, and there was a ... You 
[02:31:30]  know, sometimes you'll do these gigs, and they'll have the interpreter, the deaf interpreter.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, really?  And I said nigga, and she had the symbol for nigga.  She asked me the sign language, and I said, in every form of communication, there's a  way to say nigga.  An alien could let ... I need to know what the symbol is.  Yeah, what is the symbol?  I did not ... But she actually had it.  I was like, wow, this is fucking horrible.  Instead of a W, she makes an N out of her finger.  Wow. 
[02:32:00]  Did you feel, Dr. Lor, I kind of felt like ... She liked the way that felt coming out.  It really seemed like she enjoyed saying that.  Too much.  She's repulsive, even though she just signed with Sirius XM.  Yes, she did.  She's doing a show on Shade, actually, which is ironic.  Shade.  Yes, she just signed a big contract here.  You know, she liked the way it came out, but here's the thing I didn't get.  It was a young sister that was married to a white dude that was asking about why her white  husband tells racist jokes. 
[02:32:30]  I'm like, you stupid whore, why are you calling a white woman to ask you why your white husband  says nigga to you?  I don't get it.  Yeah, how about you asking?  Right.  I never understood.  I know so many people who get so worked up over stuff like that.  Remember when Alvin Green, the dude from South Carolina, was running for Senate, and he  would dance when people would ask him questions.  His idea for fixing the local economy was to sell caricatures of him. 
[02:33:00]  I'm like, that is a nigga.  That's a retarded name.  So how can I stop saying either one of those words when he embodies both of them?  Fuck you.  And then you go, like I was actually in Phoenix when they were doing the election returns,  and I was covering it from ABC and Facebook, and they were going on and on about this immigration  thing.  And you know, this country has a right and a responsibility to know who's coming in out  of its borders. 
[02:33:30]  You want to know who's coming in out of your home.  It's the application of the law.  Like if somebody pulls somebody over and they don't believe they're in America, they can  make them prove it.  Like if somebody walked in there right now and said, prove you, what would you show them?  Three maxed out credit cards and a foreclosure notice?  What the fuck do you...  I just...  Arizona's the last day that you need to ratify the Martin Luther King out of the name.  And that's...  I don't give a fuck if you believe in him or not.  That's a day off.  For a Friday off, I celebrate Klan Day.  I ain't going to...  I can't make the rally.  All my sheets is dirty.  But I hate niggas.  Me too sometimes.  And then you see shit like the Chilean coal mine when those women were... 
[02:34:00]  When those men were 33 miles under the earth, trapped under the earth for 70 days.  And I was thinking, how could those men survive that long?  And then I saw the Chilean bitches that were waiting for them.  Nobody was in a hurry.  Get back to the...  You got to be down there until December.  Good.  You guys need anything?  Yes, cement.  Maybe there'll be a cave-in. 
[02:34:30]  Are you fucking crazy?  One dude let his girl and his...  Remember, he had his wife and his mistress.  He was the last one.  You go up.  Ain't nothing up there for me for trouble.  And I...  I personally don't understand women these days.  Because they like a lot of shit.  Like, they love vampires.  Like, they love...  Yeah, Twilight.  Twilight and True Blood.  Now, he bites you in your neck.  You're in sinners.  You're eternally damned.  But if I give you one...  In fact, you want to break up with me.  I don't understand how the fuck that works.  One non-specific little microorganism. 
[02:35:00]  I'm in trouble.  I like the fact that DL implied that he would only give a yeast infection.  We've both been on the road for a long time.  We're both greater dangers than that, DL.  Levaquin?  Yes, give me two.  What do they call it?  Non-specific urethritis?  You read that?  No!  You've never...  Oh, you haven't.  That's what you tell your chick you had, though, when you gotta fucking take antibiotics.  You've never...  We don't know what this is, but take all of these. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, is that what it is?  Oh, absolutely.  It's non-specific.  Yeah.  There's something going on there.  It's either chlamydia or gonorrhea.  We can't quite identify it.  But it got a rhea on it.  And you better take it.  Chlamydia and gonorrhea got fucking married and suck a dick.  I actually had a urinary tract infection years ago.  It's fucking horrible.  Yeah, it is.  It's fucking horrible.  How'd you get it?  What the fuck?  Who knows how I fucking got it?  Exactly.  Somebody's squirting on my cock.  Fucking inside.  Yeah.  Some chick.  It's bad.  And the doctor never, like, says anything. 
[02:36:00]  He's just, you know, we just want you to take this cocktail of shit right here.  Yeah, this would be great.  Do they have to swab the inside of your dick?  Yeah.  I never got my dick swabbed.  No, I actually did years and years ago once.  It's horrible.  You see, I grew up, like, on 135th and Avalon.  I got, remember I was 14 years old, I got crabs.  It's a true story.  So a friend of mine came to me.  I said, man, I got bugs on it.  He said, I'll tell you what to do.  A true story.  He said, spray some Raid on your nuts.  And I actually did it.  Had to go to the hospital for poison control.  No shit.  I swear I'm 14 years old. 
[02:36:30]  Ah!  Go to the fucking hospital.  Gardena Memorial Hospital.  Did it work?  No!  Did you see that animation of his balls going, Raid!  Kill's nuts, dude.  Muhammad Ali, you should have used decon.  Decon full gone.  Yeah, it was.  But it's just, it's a really weird time.  I got him twice.  From the same girl.  I actually got him when I was 18.  She was a chick I fucked.  And then I got him from her a week later.  I was getting no puss when I was 18. 
[02:37:00]  I knew she gave him to me.  And still went back.  I went back.  She went away.  It took a week.  I'll just fucking fuck her again.  When I went back and I knew it was her.  Because I have awful straight pubes like a Chinese person.  My pubes are fucking horrendous.  So I fucking, I saw one on the end of my pube.  It's horrible.  Yeah, it is.  It's like, they're black little spots.  And you pick one out.  And the legs, it's like fucking, people think bed bugs are bad.  They're fucking horrible, man.  There's bugs all over your dick.  How disgusting is that?  And then you try to sit in the bathtub and drown them.  These motherfuckers can't survive under these conditions. 
[02:37:30]  They can hold their breath for a long time.  They do fine with their fucking faces buried in your skin, drinking blood.  You gotta fucking put that medicine rid of it.  Yeah, rid of it.  And shave my pubes, yeah.  Oh, man.  You could never have had.  That's why people lie about this.  You've never had any sexual.  I swear on my mother, I've never had any.  Oh, with my mother, actually.  I've never had.  See, either you have, though.  Any.  No.  Never?  Sexually transmitted disease.  I'm lucky. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, shit.  I'm knocking, too, man.  I used to go, man, I used to, I was, when I was growing up, I used to get it so, I used  to put my fucking cup, my dick in a cup, my dick in a little Dixie cup.  I used to go, this shit is horrible.  I used to have.  What do I have?  It was fucking horrible, man.  Yeah, no.  This girl named, I can't say her name, but she was, oh, man, it was horrible.  And then, like, all the things I see now that my, you know, that I see my children going  through, like, man, bully, everybody's talking about bullies.  And they've always existed.  Either you were a bully or you got a bully. 
[02:38:30]  Exactly.  So that was, you know, and if you've never been verbally, emotionally, or physically abused,  how would you ever be ready for marriage?  I don't understand.  But bullies are basically cowards.  Like, everything in nature seeks the path of least resistance.  Like, water buffaloes don't, a lion doesn't hunt a full-grown lion.  It waits for the sick and the weak.  So if you're weak or perceived as weak, you're going to be getting fucked.  Even if a teacher wanted to protect you, she's overcrowded and underfunded.  You get, you know, fucking harassed on your computer or your phone. 
[02:39:00]  Oh, there's going to be a time you're in that laundry room.  Yeah.  Or the school.  And my wife, my mother told me, she said, bully, this dude named Clifford used to harass me every day.  She said, he's a coward, like all bullies.  You punch him in his face and he'll leave you alone.  So the next day I punched that son of a bitch dead in his face and that motherfucker beat the shit out of you.  Proving that my mother didn't know what the hell she was talking about.  But what actually happened was I had to fight.  Every day I fought him.  Every day.  Every day.  And eventually, I would just see him and run at him.  Would he beat you, though, when you fought him? 
[02:39:30]  He would beat me every time.  And about the sixth or seventh or eighth time, he just went, man, I don't want to do this every day.  Yeah, he got bored with it.  He had to move on.  We could be in the lunchroom and I would run at him.  But that's life.  I mean, all of us, you learn more from a bloody nose a lot of times than you do from books.  You can learn that you can stand for yourself.  And I think that we live in a society where everybody paints us as these incredibly humane people.  People are very mean, especially the younger you are.  The mean, like, glee makes everybody think it's okay to come out of the closet. 
[02:40:00]  You know, like, glee, you can break out with a sound song.  If you are doing that in school, you're going to be breaking out of a headlock.  So I think we're not as tolerant as we pretend to be.  No, no.  And we never will be.  The bullying thing also is now cyberbullying, the big thing, cyberbullying.  You know what?  You're not feeling a fist punching you in the face with a cyberbully.  So I don't see how that's worse than when, you know, I was in school or someone's in school 
[02:40:30]  and just getting punched in the face.  I killed myself because somebody emailed me.  Listen, you know what?  I don't know a lot about computers, but I do know this.  If somebody says something I don't like, I sometimes hit that button.  I think they call it delete.  Yeah, yeah.  Point.  Or block them.  You can block people.  Or do what I do.  Send a cock photo.  Put a crab on it.  Put a crab on it.  There's something going on now that's just fucking brutal. 
[02:41:00]  I've never forgiven you guys since I came and yelled that two girls in a cup.  I've never.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Nice.  Oh, that's such old school now.  Disney is playing that shit now.  It's so awful.  They don't care.  I can never trust you all again.  Every time you turn the computer on, I start to run out.  And also, we didn't turn David deal.  We gave him some money for a little.  Oh, yeah.  Thank you, cranky, man.  We never forgot you.  Did he get his bed on?  Oh, we never gave you the update.  No, he's long gone.  But, oh, boy, did he use your money.  Did he?  He had a good time? 
[02:41:30]  Thumbs up.  Well, good, man.  It's always nice to know.  Dale Hughley.  That a future serial killer.  Yeah.  We kind of downplayed that whole thing.  Because right after that, you got the big CNN gig.  So we're like, oh, fuck.  We don't want to blow up our pal's spot.  Fast forward three months.  David's biting off girl's nipples and spitting in her face.  Who went down there with him?  Because somebody waited outside the joint.  And he went in and, oh, yeah.  He really did.  Oh, yeah.  He did, man.  He took your money and went right there.  That was good, man.  That's what I would have spent.  Was it Sam? 
[02:42:00]  Really fast.  Because DL never got the update on this.  It's one of the classic moments on the show of the last few years.  DL giving intern David money because he was a virgin at the time.  I'm sure he's still a virgin.  What am I thinking?  So did he get the whole ride or just the kind of?  Sam went down there.  Oh, yeah.  Sam.  Hey, Sam.  How are you?  We're not sure of Sam's ethnic background, by the way.  It's been brought on.  We actually have a DNA testing kit that we're going to do a test on to see.  There's something going on.  He's related to Thomas Jefferson.  Yeah.  Correct.  It's definitely a little Jason Keehan. 
[02:42:30]  There's something going on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, a little A-Rod.  Yeah, yeah.  Definitely something going on.  I wish you a very happy Black Friday because I just assumed.  Yeah, I know.  Well, first of all, Black Friday doesn't refer to the ethnicity.  No, I don't think so.  I didn't know that.  I thought I got shit for half-fright.  But what are you, though?  You're something.  My parents are both Caucasians.  Exactly.  DL is something going on.  Your parents are because Caucasian is mine.  DL.  DL. 
[02:43:00]  DL will run with this.  Sam, tell DL who you're related to and then watch DL.  I just said, yeah.  Thomas Jefferson.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, there's another one.  Yeah.  You know, I was actually, so Sally Hemings is your, you relate to her, too, obviously,  right?  I don't know if that's obvious.  That would be the slave.  Obviously, yeah, yeah.  That's why you have to be.  She was the one that ruined the reunions.  Yeah, yeah.  She's here to clean up. 
[02:43:30]  So you do know that you have black in you, though.  You understand that, right?  Well, I mean, look, it appears that way.  No, motherfucker.  We recognize each other.  Some people have gay darts.  And he's really into hip-hop and shit.  Yeah, that would be me.  Yeah.  Big Jay-Z fan.  Nah, but in a different way than a white guy.  He's a big Lil Wayne fan.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Did you think that, has anybody ever thought you were black before?  Everybody.  Yeah.  I mean, nobody has not thought I was black before at this point.  Even the police ever had this nigga get out of the car. 
[02:44:00]  And until recently, he only dated black girls.  Really?  Yes.  Wow.  Not recently, but before the girl that I'm with now, yeah.  That's what I mean.  Before you realize why they were laughing.  I've never had sex with a white woman.  Huh?  I've never had sex with a white chick.  Really?  No.  Afraid of mace?  I don't know what that is.  I don't know what to, but I'm surprised by that.  You could.  Well, you're married, aren't you?  What is that?  My wife is not going to ask me about her.  I just never had.  So you only knock off black women?  Before the girl I'm with now, yeah.  But I've been with her for five years.  Now he's like all-American white girl he's with. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  Does she think you like, she thinks you're black, though?  She told me, I told her I was going to do the DNA thing, and she said she would prefer  if there was some black.  Really?  Really?  She would like that.  Why?  Because you're trying to say it.  Why?  Jess is a little, uh...  Hey, we have the DNA test, don't we?  Yeah.  All they got to do is swab your cheek, and then, uh...  Can we do that while DL's in here?  No, no, no.  I don't want to do that, because I might have a child or two that I...  I'm not giving up.  No, no, no.  Not you.  No, not you.  So you...  We'll swab Sam today.  Come here, man.  Put your hand next to mine. 
[02:45:00]  I have cousins look like you.  Really?  I promise.  A lot.  We used to beat them up all the time.  Because they used to get...  Exactly.  The light-skinned cousins always got the best Christmas presents, but, uh...  They would get toy.  Would you get rock and soccer?  Would you get a job application?  It was fun.  We do have something, though, that is going to be able to tell part of his ethnic background  there as well.  Yeah, we went...  It's a professional DNA test.  They've got credits and everything.  Yeah, we're just going to swab them and then send it out. 
[02:45:30]  Oh, we got to send it out.  Yeah, we're going to do that today.  But, uh, tell DL about Intern David.  Oh, my God.  He was a changed person when he came out of the, uh...  He was in there for a full hour.  Who does that?  Yeah, right.  And, I mean, he said...  First of all...  He was probably trying to sell her insurance or something.  Let me tell you, this is wonderful.  He didn't know.  It's his first time.  He thinks she's supposed to, like, fucking woo her.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  It was.  It was his first time.  No candy, honey.  Just let's get to it.  If you get a massage, literally a minute into it, I'm fucking...  I'm moving my ass like a dog scratching his pussy on the rug. 
[02:46:00]  Just trying to get a finger back there.  Let's get this over.  Exactly, yeah.  My shoulders are fine, idiot.  He did feel like, uh...  She liked him, though.  He thought...  We all did.  He thought the masseuse, you know, had a little thing for him.  Oh, really?  Like, he's the guy?  Yeah, because she kind of...  He said she kind of laid down next to him.  Yeah, that's what they do.  Yeah, but you have to be next to them to fuck them.  That's how it works.  Well, it was just, uh, like a hand release.  Of course.  Oh, you got a handy?  Yeah.  I mean, it wasn't, you know... 
[02:46:30]  Did he say how long it took?  It took him an hour to get a hand release?  No, there's probably a massage first.  She probably massaged him.  I think she, yeah.  She probably did the little brush on the back of the balls with the nail that they...  Oh, it's fucking...  There's nothing better.  When you don't know if they're going to do it or not.  Yeah.  And then you feel the brush from the thigh of the balls.  You're like, oh, good.  She's a member of the club.  Yeah, that's how we do little tell-tale signs.  Is that what it is, like, the secret hand shake?  Yeah.  I hate when they wrap you like a mummy and they lift your leg and it's proper draping  and you're like, oh, fuck you.  You went to school for this shit.  Proper draping. 
[02:47:00]  Jimmy knows all the lingo.  It's proper draping.  I hate proper draping.  Stinks.  People turn over and they turn away.  Oh, my God.  They hold up the sheet.  You turn around.  I'm not shy.  That's the one I used to always use.  I'm not shy.  I've had a woman that go, I am.  Oh, my God.  That's great.  This is going to be a massage, isn't it?  Boom.  Fuck you and your dignity.  Right, right, right.  I know we had the fourth season, but go ahead.  Touch it.  You know what's so amazing?  I've been married for 25 years and I still sound like a fucking kid.  You know how the same shit you used to do, please just touch it, let me put all that 
[02:47:30]  same shit.  Same shit.  It's still the same shit.  That'll never go away.  I don't think that ever goes away.  I'm like, oh.  What are you just supposed to turn into a guy that's like, oh, let's rub some intercourse.  Right.  No, it's just that feels good, yeah.  I don't feel like paying the fucking car, no, but that's got to happen.  Let's make this happen, touch.  Let's get to it.  You are.  I hope that when you find out you're black, it doesn't hurt you.  It wouldn't hurt me.  I mean. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah, well, what's your credit score, motherfucker?  Yeah, you see his credit score goes down.  Is Bobby going to be bummed out?  Well, I would hope that she would probably know.  It's his mom.  Well, no, because we think it comes from your dad's side, right?  I don't know.  Wait, she was related to Thomas Jefferson or your dad?  Well, my uncle is on my mom's side.  One of them has some curly hair and it gets a little more in that direction.  Like curly, like my curly or curly like your curly?  More like my curly. 
[02:48:30]  Wait, Thomas Jefferson is what side of the family, though?  I think Thomas Jefferson is my dad's side of the family.  But you think the black might come from Bobby's side?  Well, there's a lot more.  That's confusing.  There's a lot more shadiness.  We assumed there was some Thomas Jefferson.  No pun intended.  Well.  On her side of the family.  All right.  Really?  So you're a half.  So you're a mixed race child.  I didn't even know they had the NBA back then.  Did they have that?  D.L. Hughley has no doubt in his mind that you have a black in it. 
[02:49:00]  You think so?  Absolutely.  What percentage?  Enough of a percentage to get shot in a random.  A random pullover.  You're obvious.  Like any black person.  You're like a.  See, because there's only a couple of shades of black.  Like there's Obama black.  Yeah.  There's Wesley Snipes black.  You know, Terrence Howard black.  It's just three shades, right?  So you're pretty Obama.  You think so?  Yeah.  Wow.  Okay.  Yeah.  It's cool, right?  It takes a good new suit. 
[02:49:30]  For people that don't know, Sam has very white skin.  I think it's just.  Yeah.  It's very light.  That's why we're very.  We're trying to figure this out.  There's just something going on.  Yeah.  Opie has always said I have a black person eyebrows.  What?  Which I don't.  Very much.  You have Muppet eyebrows.  They're not even personal eyebrows.  I could handle that.  Either that or Caterpillars are taking a nap on your voice.  You're very obvious.  Does your father look black?  No.  No, he's got, you know, straight hair and a handlebar mustache.  He looks like a slave owner, as a matter of fact.  Right, yeah.  There's some shit going on. 
[02:50:00]  I'm just telling you.  I'm just telling you.  His father.  He looks like the guy from the Monopoly game.  Yeah, his father has a handlebar mustache.  Yeah.  Really?  Old school.  Here's the thing.  All of us find out.  Like, I found out.  My father wasn't my father at Thanksgiving.  You know, my uncle got drunk.  You know that ain't your real daddy.  Oh, shit.  How many years ago did you find that out?  I was 12.  Holy shit.  It was hilarious.  Oh, it's hilarious.  Hilarious now.  Then it wasn't.  But it's clear that we have a lot of secrets in our families.  People do.  Yeah.  And that ain't your daddy. 
[02:50:30]  That's all I'm just saying.  Did you hear Patrice O'Neill's theory on why my mom treats me so well?  Uh-uh.  Why?  That Patrice, he's convinced that my mom had a torrid affair with a black man,  and that was her true love.  Oh.  But it was, you know, it was after she was married, and it was forbidden.  And he left.  And that's why she treats me so well, because...  But your brother has some features, too.  What the fuck is this, Bagger Vance?  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know. 
[02:51:00]  This is the emotions that she would feel about.  A patch of blue?  What the fuck are you?  He knocked off a white chick at a club.  Come on.  What happened?  I know.  Where's she from originally?  Kentucky, then Detroit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Detroit?  Detroit?  Yeah, her family's from Kentucky.  Oh, Detroit.  She moved to Detroit at a young age.  Any white people living in Detroit in the Witness Protection Program?  It's only Kid Rock and Eminem.  That's it.  And it's this.  If neither one of those is your father, you...  There is so much circumstantial evidence here. 
[02:51:30]  Detroit?  Right.  Yeah, Kentucky, then Detroit.  Yeah.  She moved from Kentucky to Detroit.  When she was young, she moved from Kentucky to Detroit.  When she was young.  Well, let's do the test.  How do we swab?  I don't know.  It's probably got to be sterile and everything.  I mean, we can do it, but, I mean, they prefer that there has been no eating or drinking  for at least an hour and all that stuff, so we're going to do it.  I just ate a box of nerds.  That's not going to...  If we're going to do it, we should do it correctly, because these things are kind of expensive.  We should do it on the air, though, right?  We could.  I mean, there's two collection jars, and they would like you to fill both of them, but they'd 
[02:52:00]  like...  What the fuck?  We had Jerry Spray with Maury Povich now?  Yeah, I know.  It's like, well, we just want to really put this to rest.  What kind of gene shows up that it lets you know?  I don't know.  It's like a little...  The gene had a little fro on it?  There's some menthol in the DNA.  The watermelon gene.  The gene that's shaped like a pack of Kool's?  What the fuck?  A pack of Kool's?  No, honestly, would you really be...  You wouldn't be slightly depressed if you found out you were black. 
[02:52:30]  If I found out I was black, no.  Slightly.  If I found out that it was my...  One of my parents was actually black in the sense that my father was not actually my father,  that would be...  Oh, like family shit.  That would kind of be like...  If it happened way back when?  Oh, if we could destroy your parents' marriage.  How great would that be for the father, though?  Like, this fucking zilch didn't fall out of my dickhead.  What a great moment for him.  Don't let this shit...  Hey, man.  But I'm sure you told your parents you're going through with this.  How are they about it?  Yeah, I said I was here.  They just laughed. 
[02:53:00]  Did your mother shit?  And go like, oh, boy.  I don't know.  I guess they didn't look at space as a talk.  Laugh.  Come on, have one of these pig feet.  Let's sit up.  He wants a Kool-Aid, son?  Now, look.  Let's get down to this.  She was too busy crying to a Tyler Perry movie.  Wow.  So you would be more hurt than your father or...  Right.  That would be worse.  You look like your mom.  Not so much your father.  I do look more like my mom, I think.  Not so much your father. 
[02:53:30]  Would he still accept...  Because if I found out one of my kids wasn't mine, even like mine, I have a 23-year-old,  22.  Jesus, that's unbelievable.  You say that every time, too.  I just can't believe it.  I would...  I would...  I wouldn't...  They would have to give me all the money back.  I'm not bullshitting right then.  All the love and presents.  Fuck you.  Not mine.  Not mine.  Go find your real daddy.  What did you do when you found out your father wasn't your father?  I was 12 years old, and I just kind of just went, is that true?  And he went, shut the fuck down and eat.  He didn't eat it.  And he took me outside.  The true story said, the only steps in this house are here. 
[02:54:00]  You'll never ask me that again.  And I never...  So who's the only steps in the house?  I...  My real father just died about, what, three weeks ago?  Three months ago?  Get the fuck out of here.  Sorry to hear.  And people are going, you know your real father.  Maybe you had a relationship with him.  I did.  I never knew him.  I met him.  I met him.  But how was he related to the family?  Who my...  Real dad.  Or your biological dad.  My biological father.  Only reason I knew he died was because my mother, you know, had some kind of way kept up a relationship with him.  And I never knew that.  But he called. 
[02:54:30]  They called and said, well, you know, I have some bad news for you.  Sit down.  Your father died.  And I'm thinking, Charles, my father?  And it devastated me.  And then she said, well, Jerry, yeah.  I'm like, I didn't...  I didn't know that.  I mean, I feel bad that any human being dies.  I'm not...  Certainly not the case.  Right, right.  But it's not like...  But I don't know what...  Where did you meet him?  I met him.  My wife...  It was before my third HBO special.  My wife comes in and she goes, uh, listen, don't be mad.  You know how women say you promise not to be mad.  Yeah, before they say something.  Before you even say, I found your real father. 
[02:55:00]  I'm like, I didn't even know I was looking for my fucking real father.  So she flew him out.  He came to my house.  I met him.  He was walking around.  We were doing the Hughleys and he was sitting at the pool playing with the kids.  Then I came home and I go, man, you're going to have to get the fuck out of here.  I would appreciate medical records, though.  And that was pretty much it.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, wow.  He wanted to stay?  Yeah, he was like, now I'm your father and I missed you.  Yeah, because you're D.L. Hughley.  Yeah, that's like, holy shit.  If I was a crackhead, you'd think you were the same thing.  You're some crackhead.  He's not playing around the pool with your kids.  So it was over.  But he left my kids a bunch of some stuff for them. 
[02:55:30]  And if they want it, they'll have to hire their own lawyers and go get it.  I'm not going to get it.  Who'd you assume was your father?  Charles Hughley.  Oh, yeah.  He gave me, you know, I mean, to me, he's never been the warmest man in the world, but he's always been, you know, he would, he never had treated us different.  Like, I know, I don't have that skill.  Like, I know that if I couldn't, if children weren't mine, I would treat my children better.  Like, I'd come home, my real kids come with me, the rest of you motherfuckers paint the house. 
[02:56:00]  I'm sure I would do that.  We ran out of ice cream, hit some rocks.  I'm sure, and you would think, like, we had a, my niece, she had four kids.  She's 20-something years old.  She had four kids.  The state of California was taking her kids because she had a dope problem, right?  So the state comes out and they go, well, you know, you have to have food in the cabin.  You have to have a fence over the pool.  You have to have a carbon monoxide monitor.  I'm like, these motherfuckers are fresh from a crack house. 
[02:56:30]  What the fuck do they care about fumes they can't see?  What the fuck do they care about fumes they can't see?  And actually, I couldn't, I couldn't take the whole process that you had to go through.  They had to keep coming out to your house, make surprise visits.  Like, you know, you have to put a fence around the pool.  But when my kids, even in California, that's one thing, you have to put a fence around the pool. 
[02:57:00]  But I just taught my kids how to swim.  I was like, why the fuck are they?  Yeah, how about you do that?  That way they fall in.  And then I'm, hey, that's the Luke Costello rule.  His kid fell in.  Oh, yeah.  He was five.  Yeah, he's sundrowned.  Back then, in the 40s, whatever, they didn't have any rules like that.  A good friend of mine is that.  We didn't have fucking fences growing up either, did we?  Yeah, they started.  Started, though, right?  Yeah, they started that shit.  They weren't going backyards where all of a sudden the pool was just there.  But I think some of it was grandfathered in.  Like, if you had a pool and it didn't have a fence, then you didn't have to do that.  Or if there was a fence around your property, that was good enough. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, now it's like the pool area.  I know.  It has to have a minor.  It has to have a beep.  Yeah, every single entrance and exit from your house or the yard into your pool area  needs like a meh thing that fucking goes off.  You know what else?  A lot of black people don't know how to swim at all.  Yeah, that seems to be that.  You can live on a fucking island.  But if we say that, we would get fired.  Nah, we've said it for sure.  It's one of the advantages to being black.  You can say some shit.  But why can't you? 
[02:58:00]  In a couple of weeks, you'll be able to do something.  That's great news.  Can you swim, Sam?  Yeah, I can swim.  That'll go away after that DNA test comes back.  You're like, ah, no.  Why is it black people can't swim?  I don't.  I actually can.  I'm a very good swimmer.  But I think that it was...  In general, though, you're saying black people can't swim.  There is a, you know, even on, they were running this program on, Brian Gumbel, he did this  thing, and it talked about how many young black men, boys are dying at pools because they  don't know how to swim.  It just was on about three, about six months ago. 
[02:58:30]  And one of the things that happened with us, I grew up in the inner city, and they would  bring a little pool around and made us learn how to swim.  We had to all learn.  And I didn't even know why.  Like, motherfucker, I'll never own a pool.  What the fuck do you want me to swim?  Yeah, why do I need to know how to swim?  Oh, every year, Coney Island, it's just like, okay, two or three people die.  It's like, one guy goes in, he gets all fucked up, his friend goes to get him, and then the  third friend goes in, and three bodies come out.  You're like, I don't want to jump to conclusions, but I don't think I need to look at the pictures 
[02:59:00]  and pay for him.  I knew about four people drowned when I was growing up.  Yeah, really?  You knew four people that drowned?  Jesus Christ.  And like, oh, one dude was high at Redondo Beach, one dude in the pool.  I had a friend who had a pool that never cleaned out, and they were looking for this boy in  the neighborhood, and he was at the bottom of the pool.  Holy shit.  It was horrible shit.  Then one dude, he fell in the pool, and his tennis shoe got wrapped around the rail, because  remember, they used to have those rails that went into the water.  Man. 
[02:59:30]  And he never got it.  It was like, wow.  But all kind of shit would grow, and it always, like the other week, my wife called me, she  goes, Oprah has these men on, and they've all been molested.  And I went, wow, 200 men.  And I thought, she said, I said, you know, in my whole life, I never got molested.  Like, I never did.  Like, so even when I was young, nobody wanted to fuck me.  So, were you guys going to get diddled?  Were you going home?  Yeah, just going to go home, watch TV, play.  Hey, find out my father's not really my father. 
[03:00:00]  Hey, yeah, well, I guess we all have our crosses to bear.  I'd rather have that cross to bear than you with the dick up the ass one.  But you at least want to be assed.  I mean.  Right, right.  I mean, you don't find me slightly attractive?  Oh, shit.  Playing up to the molester a little bit.  No, nothing.  All right.  I'll go play basketball, I guess.  There are certain racial stereotypes that just, man, they have to be based in some kind  of fact.  Yeah.  And that was one.  Another one I just read about over the weekend was that 80% of African-American women are 
[03:00:30]  considered in the category of obese.  Yeah.  And 80%?  No.  80 fucking percent.  And it's because culturally it's more accepted and they have a better self-image of themselves  being fatter than white women or Hispanic women do.  I think that what, here's the thing, when I see a hippie woman, like, I like women that  are built for comfort, not for speed. 
[03:01:00]  I don't like, I like a Cadillac better than a Porsche.  That's just, that's, that's, that's, but I like a thick woman.  Yeah, I do.  I like thicker, I don't like, I don't like, I don't like, I like a nice muscle.  So I don't think that it's as much, I think that it's the classification of obesity that  that would be, uh.  It was, classification was based on body fat per size.  Yeah, but if it's all in the ass, I'm all right.  I never thought of that.  If it's all in the ass, you're fine.  I like, I like a woman whose ass is so big I got to stand way back to get the full view. 
[03:01:30]  Hey, honey, don't cough or this is going to be a short trip.  See, the one, the, the, the, the big ass isn't bad, but I don't like that Florida Evans  inner tube neck thing.  Well, who does, though?  James!  Nobody likes that.  No one likes that.  No, but, no, but that's just it.  Like, from what I read, you'll get the diva women going like, well, I look good.  I look good.  Yeah, but they always look good.  No, you don't look good.  But look at, like, like, like a woman like, uh, like, uh, like Jennifer Lopez, she was, 
[03:02:00]  oh yeah, but that, yeah, she, there wasn't, uh, many guys,  that would say she wasn't looking really good.  Yeah.  Big ass.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Who else was, uh, I like a nice big deep crack.  Like a fucking, I like a big ass with a fucking deep crack.  But it's not like Monique coming out and going, hi, look, people.  And you're looking going like, eh, she looks kind of fat.  Does it shave her legs?  Yeah, you like Monique?  I like, I like.  You like Monique?  No, the listener, don't we? 
[03:02:30]  You paused way too long, sir.  I think that she is a, she's a nice woman, and I don't mind a hairy leg.  Really?  Oh, really?  Wow.  See, I don't mind hairy pits, a hairy leg would drive me crazy.  I don't mind a hairy pussy.  Boo!  Not crazy, Harry.  Not crazy, Harry.  Like you're going down and it's tickling you, you almost sneeze the whole time.  Who was the one we were talking about that?  I like the natural shape, though, to let you know, hey, I remember that from 70s Playboys.  I don't like when it's like, you know, when they don't, like, they don't commit to shaving  it, it's kind of happy. 
[03:03:00]  Or just a little thing there.  It's like, bitch, what are you, a cactus?  Do something.  I bury my face in a fucking porcupine, won't you?  Sometimes it looks good if they're standing up.  Like, but then they lay down and spread, it's like, it's like a tuft of hair just sitting  there waiting for a comb over.  Wait, you don't mind hairy legs?  I don't.  I can't fucking touch hairy legs at all.  You're even like a little stubble if they forget to shave one day.  I don't like stubble.  That's kind of fun, no.  I don't care about, but if the hair's growing in.  It's your hands on it.  No, get rid of it. 
[03:03:30]  There's a lot of shit.  Like, I don't like, I don't like when, like, I never like when my wife has to, like, hey,  girl, come here for a minute.  I have to wash up and I've been there.  I don't like that.  Yeah.  I don't like in the morning, you won't kiss.  I don't like that.  Wait, you fool around in the morning?  Yes.  Oh, no.  See, Jimmy don't like that.  Why, Jimmy?  I don't feel sexy.  I feel awful and just achy.  I want to be left alone.  My girlfriend tried to fuck me in the morning.  Grandpa.  I can't do it.  I can only become a sex addict.  So for me, it has to be a big lead.  I don't want fucking horrible morning breath in my face.  I like it. 
[03:04:00]  I like that paprika taste.  I like it.  I do.  I don't like, I don't like when it has, everything has to be just so.  No, no, no.  I don't like it.  So can we get back to Monique?  You like her?  I think she's very, I think she could be, I don't think she's sexy.  I think she's attractive.  But that's, but that's exactly what this article said.  But it's a difference between, like, not like, not like, I knock her off.  Right, right.  But I think she's attractive.  Yeah, but then the next one was Queen Latifah.  We did this whole break.  You don't think she's attractive?  You think Monique's more attractive than?  I do.  I'm really confused. 
[03:04:30]  Because she's much more feminine to me.  Yeah, Latifah is.  I mean, but, you know, I think Queen Latifah has a beautiful face, but let me tell you something.  See, you get a white girl like that, and she is not going to be looked at in the least.  But that would be a joke.  You'd sit there and go, aha, I get it.  She's making a joke.  But now, Monique dressed up like that, it's more accepted.  That is what she looks like.  My mother, my aunts.  Is that what the whole thing is?  Kind of.  And I wouldn't knock off my mother.  But I don't think that, I think that our, to me, and I hate when people try to pretend 
[03:05:00]  like they, I think that I have always, if a woman is, like, you know who's very sexy  to me, and she's kind of big, Jill Scott.  She's very sexy.  Who's that?  Jill Scott.  She's a singer.  Pull up with Jill Scott.  She's very sexy.  I know the name.  She's very sexy to me.  Her.  In a way.  Yeah, all right.  There's no problem.  In a way with, you know, I don't want you to, like, my wife, if I gained 350 pounds,  would you still love me?  No.  No.  If I can't lift you, I can't love you.  That's the thing.  Wow, she's big, though.  Big girl.  I didn't see the whole body.  What a set on her. 
[03:05:30]  Big boobies, though, at least.  Yeah.  What about, uh, the new one is Precious.  People saying how beautiful she is.  That's not true.  Of course it's not true.  That's not true at all.  And people get mad.  A lot of people are saying, though.  No, people, listen, listen.  They got mad.  I was doing the radio then.  They got mad because they said they didn't put on a magazine.  Magazines are for shit you want.  Mm-hmm.  Like, magazines are all about fantasies.  You looking at a car you want or a place you'll never go or a woman you'll never fucking  have.  Right on.  I don't want to want the motherfucker I can go see at Lane Bryant. 
[03:06:00]  I don't want that.  Like, she's the stock girl.  I don't want that.  Now, I'm.  Well, people have gotten in trouble for saying that she's not attractive.  Wow.  They didn't put her on a cover of magazines.  Of course she's not attractive.  Because they don't have a fold-out for the fucking cover.  That's why.  Exactly.  She's a fat lady.  Nobody wants to look at a fat lady.  She's brutal looking.  But people get angry.  The truth to me is, like, when Juan Williams gets on TV and he goes, look at her.  That's the.  Oh, my God.  They really uglied her.  Wow.  Thank you so much.  That pretty is.  Biggie is back right there. 
[03:06:30]  Holy shit.  People get mad for the, like, Juan Williams get fired from NPR because he said when he  gets on a plane and somebody would.  That's ridiculous.  That guy shouldn't have gotten fired.  And I'm a liberal, but liberals are the worst.  We defend.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Jimmy says all the time.  I'm a liberal, but they're the fucking worst.  Yeah, we defended him.  We're like, get the fuck out of here.  Enough already.  People got mad at me for.  Like, I don't care what people do.  I really.  I really.  This is not just something I say just to be fucking, you know, contrary.  I really believe that freedom of speech is absolutely paramount. 
[03:07:00]  I think that everybody should be able to.  Regardless of what I believe, my personal ideological viewpoint, I just think that we have regressed  to a society as a society to set the point that we can't even have.  If a chick is fat, she's fat.  Yeah.  If a motherfucker's dumb, he's dumb.  If you get scared when somebody looks like the caricature of what you think is a terrorist,  it's not wrong to feel that way.  It's wrong to act on.  And that was his point.  Right, right.  You should be able to.  Freedom of speech isn't. 
[03:07:30]  People feel that freedom of speech is also the freedom to not be offended.  Right.  And it's absolutely, you can offend through your speech.  It's going to happen.  No, go ahead.  No, no.  I was going to say, we punish honesty.  It's like, if you're honest and what you say is impolite or unpleasant or offensive to  anyone, you're punished for it.  Just a country of cunts.  Right.  Every other day, someone's apologizing for just being honest on TV.  I'm sorry if I offended anybody, by the way.  It's unbelievable. 
[03:08:00]  I mean that.  And it always seems like.  It's disgusting.  Like the ground zero controversy.  Now, here's the thing.  To castigate 1.5 billion people with the same broad stroke is wrong.  But the visceral reaction is, and I live like right across the street from that.  I'm proud to live in a country that that could actually happen where a group that we, you  know, where any group can have their kind of say.  But viscerally, I'm going, I don't want the motherfuckers to live there.  But I'm proud to live in a country where that can happen. 
[03:08:30]  So you can have those dualities.  I can have my visceral reaction, and also the law protects them.  That's the point.  They should be legally allowed to do it.  And nobody was, I don't think, a lot of people anyway, were not saying they didn't have the  legal right to do it.  Sure.  No, but I'm talking about the, we don't, we even feel bad.  Like, here's the thing.  This is the truth.  There are a lot of white people who don't like the idea that the president of the United  States of America is black.  They can't say that.  Now, I don't think that that means.  Oh, I do it on a daily basis.  I'm serious.  They don't.  Now, they can say, I'm not racist.  Well, if a black dude was fucking your daughter, all of a sudden, you might not like it. 
[03:09:00]  Or if he's running your country, you might not like it.  And rather than saying, I am uncomfortable with that, we go all around it.  It is clear that there are a lot of people.  Listen, the same set of circumstances existed.  We had a guy, the government guy out of control, spending was crazy.  Why all of a sudden, when the tan dude came in, you have this big a problem with us?  I would respect people more for saying, I'm slightly uncomfortable with the fact that  a black man is running this country, rather than making up all this bullshit.  That's just, and don't get me wrong, he does a lot of things I don't personally like. 
[03:09:30]  What?  Here's your opportunity.  I've always said I'm uncomfortable with it.  Yeah, but you must admit that a lot of people who are uncomfortable.  But I had talks around instead of just saying he's uncomfortable by the field.  Motherfuckers don't even like black quarterbacks.  Michael Vick, are you kidding me?  I'm just saying, I'm just saying, I'm just saying, I'm just saying, I was okay with that,  but the coaching thing really got me.  Yeah, we don't like the black coaches.  All the leadership positions, people really have a problem, you know, people go, wow.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course, yeah.  I think we're all the black quarterbacks by now, aren't we, as a society? 
[03:10:00]  Even now.  Black coaches, not so much.  I'll tell you what, black quarterbacks, every time something happens, like Vince Young,  he's not, he doesn't have the mental aptitude, he's having these problems, he's a breakdown.  There is a, you know, when you watch a lot of football, and the position of quarterback,  you have to know coverages, you got to switch them on a dime, you got to, there is a real  level of intelligence that's associated with it.  It is clearly the most sophisticated position on the field.  He has to be everything.  He has to know everything. 
[03:10:30]  And I think that a lot of people, when you equate intelligence with something, have a problem  believing that a black man can, you know, Michael Vick's a better quarterback now because  he stays in the pocket, and he dissects defenses instead of trying to beat them, you know,  athletically.  And I think people have a problem believing that black people can think their way out  of something.  Well, that's one of the problems with Obama, I think.  It's like, he's a Harvard elitist.  That's what annoys me about him.  He's an elitist guy.  He's an Ivy League elitist dude.  A nerd.  And he thinks like, the type of liberal I don't like he thinks like, which is, I know 
[03:11:00]  it's better for you than you, it just annoys me.  But people don't think because he's black that he's an elitist.  But I think he is.  He very much is.  He governs like a life can't do wood.  Well, I think the black community thought they were getting Huey P. Newton.  And they wound up getting a nerd.  And he sucks at basketball, by the way.  He really does.  I've played many, many years of basketball.  But you'll make up for it.  When we get that test back, you're going to become a much better basketball player, Sam. 
[03:11:30]  But I think also one of the problems people have, like, to me, he's everybody, the thing  that everybody thought were such great attributes, like he's very calm, cool, and selective, like  he never reacts, all this kind of stuff.  Here's the thing.  If you were in a relationship with somebody and they never reacted, you would assume they  didn't care.  Yeah, true.  You would go, this motherfucker never gets mad, never gets jealous, never shouts, never.  You would, and I think the country is like this, he never gets emotional.  Yeah, it almost comes off as dishonest. 
[03:12:00]  Like, you've got to be pissed at this.  Come on.  Spike Lee wanted him to show his emotions about the BP oil spill.  But honestly, I'm not interested in the personal feelings of any politician.  I don't care what they feel.  I don't care what you, get it done.  Not their personal feelings.  Any of them.  I don't want to hear it.  How about a passion for what's going on?  Empathy.  Yeah, empathy.  Clinton had that.  Yeah.  Reagan had that.  You know, people say whatever they want to do.  Bush not so much.  But it showed it, even Bush showed it a little bit.  Clinton clearly had it, and Reagan clearly had it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Reagan's sole attribute was to make us feel, this country feel better about itself.  Yeah, yeah.  I didn't think he was a great president. 
[03:12:30]  Especially coming off the heels of Carter.  Yeah.  Everybody was like, oh, we suck.  Carter didn't have it.  No.  No, no.  Carter had with, and it's just amazing to me that you can't say, I personally have a,  like what made me mad was when he, when McChrystal makes all these statements  in Rolling Stone magazine, you wait three or four days to fire him, Charlie Sherrod said something  allegedly, three minutes, she's fired.  I mean, he just never, so, but I also think he's in a situation now where he's kind of  damned if he does and damned if he doesn't. 
[03:13:00]  My daughter said something to me, she graduated from Smith, she wanted to go to D.C. to be  part of this thing she thought would happen, this transformation of this country she thought  would happen, which was really disappointing to me.  Two weeks before the election, she calls me, she works for Senator Barbara Boxer.  Every day she gets called a nigger, cunt, bitch, you know, I hope you get cancer, because  she is, every day she answers the phone, she actually said to me, I wish that I knew what  he was doing, and then it would be worth being called all these names.  Oh, wow. 
[03:13:30]  And she's 23 years old, the person that put it on, that's what I knew, that's what's  going to be a problem.  You've got a lot of 23-year-olds in your family.  I've got a 23-year-old daughter.  My son will be 22 in December 6th.  My daughter's 19.  I wasn't sure if they were twins or what.  Hey, were you a big Obama fan?  I was a big, I wanted to.  And where you at today is the follow-up.  I wanted to see, I'll tell you what, I cried during the election.  Me too.  For different reasons.  If this was all I was going to get, why did I cry? 
[03:14:00]  Oh, right, yeah.  Wait a minute, is that where you're at?  No, I think, I think that.  You were expecting a lot more in general.  I wasn't, I wouldn't actually, you know what I thought?  I thought that he would at least have, you know, when you say that you're going to do  all these transformative things, I wish you would govern like that.  Mm-hmm.  He almost governs like a guy who goes, well, you know, he got to get through this first  term and then he'll really kick ass.  That's what you hear people say a lot.  I think that it is a hell of a political statement that the Republican Party was written off two 
[03:14:30]  years ago as dead and not existing and sweeping the power in unprecedented numbers.  Amazing.  He shouldn't have tackled, he shouldn't have tackled such a big thing like, like his mistake  was underestimating how much people wanted the economy fixed, which was not, he didn't  start the mess in motion that was before him.  But how about looking at Bill Clinton doing the same thing and heading that off?  He went into the health care thing and him and Hillary at the same time when he first  got elected and then realized, oh, fuck, this is sinking me. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah.  This is sinking me.  And he backed off.  It only sank him.  He had super majorities in both the Congress and the Senate.  He should have came in, did it, got it all with and moved on.  But he allowed this vacuum to be filled with all these noises.  If he was going to do it, he should have did it right away.  And if he'd have done it earlier, then at least some of the things that, like the greatest  thing that I got, my daughter gets to go back on my insurance and gets to say, that's  what I get.  I got three more years writing this little fucking hooker off. 
[03:15:30]  Great.  Great.  I should have said, I literally have the best children in the world.  Yeah.  I do.  Even though my son, you know, he's my daughter.  I'm sure my youngest daughter will be a stripper, but I'll love her.  And I'll come home and there'll be a thong hanging from a pen somewhere with singles  in it, I'm sure.  You'll be just as proud, though, right?  You'll be just as proud.  I won't be as proud, but I love her as much.  And the thing that hurt me the most about this whole situation is how vast their hopes 
[03:16:00]  were.  Yeah, yeah.  That they thought that things would...  Yeah, because we've been beaten at this point.  But it does cross all racial lines.  You're not going to get much out of any politics.  It's like all of them are of a certain breed to become that...  Like, nobody gets that far in politics without being a shitty liar on some level.  You can't succeed in politics without being that.  That kind of...  Unless you're going to be taking a little car trip down in Dallas.  No, Obama's getting the same fucking...  That was the last guy that really tried to... 
[03:16:30]  Yeah.  Let's shake things up a little bit.  I think Carter was an honest guy.  Jimmy Carter was very honest.  Yeah, the job was fairly honest.  Jimmy Carter came off as a very nice, honest guy.  Even after his presidency, went on with Habitat for Humanity.  But yeah, just no ability to really grab the bull by the horns.  Reagan coming in...  The United States was shit in the world's eye.  Yeah, when he said, it's shining, sitting on the hill.  Yeah, yeah.  And he just whipped everybody back into shape, like, oh my God, this is going to be amazing. 
[03:17:00]  Right.  Clinton, during his presidency, didn't like his policies, didn't like a lot of what he was  doing.  But looking back, his legacy as president is going to be really good.  There's a house of food right in modern history.  Yeah, he's going to have a great legacy.  I mean, people have to forget about the blowjob thing.  No one really cares about it.  People...  I mean, really, honestly, no one really cared about it.  People did.  It was just news.  But it was more of an entertainment news than political news.  Of course, the Republicans tried to hang him with it, Rush Limbaugh and everything. 
[03:17:30]  But it became mostly just late night TV jokes and...  He was a character, but you know, yeah.  Like, even in California, Meg Whitman, she was one of the...  And this bitch looked like Ben Franklin.  Every time she gave a speech, all I wanted to say is five, five dollar foot loan.  And then she actually...  People are so disingenuous.  You know, disingenuous...  You had...  I didn't...  Her campaign was basically sunk when she said, I had...  You know, it was disclosed she had a legal housekeeper.  She didn't know.  Yep.  How the fuck don't you know?  You know how you know you got a legal housekeeper? 
[03:18:00]  When she's a fucking housekeeper.  That's what you know.  Ain't nobody going to do that job for $3.50 a year.  Yeah.  Damn, you make a great point.  All that work.  And then isn't it your job to hand out a W-2 and all that shit?  And if you, if you spend $152 million to be the governor of the state of California, but  you won't spend $90 an hour on Mary May, you stupid whore.  Get the fuck up.  You just wrecked your career.  If you, and then, and then, like, and then all the shit that we, like Proposition 19, the  move to legalize marijuana, which will eventually, I knew it wasn't going to happen because you 
[03:18:30]  can't get a bunch of weed heads to remember to fucking vote.  Like, that's what it is.  Is he both the day?  Oh, that's the day?  Yeah, your, your whole demographic isn't voting.  Right, right.  They're smoking weed going, why didn't this pass?  Well, get the fuck out.  Kind of an important day for us.  Yeah.  Get out there.  I'll go tomorrow.  Yeah, I'll go tomorrow.  No, that's not a word.  California is much more conservative than people think.  A lot more.  A lot more.  Yeah.  When it came to the gays and that cunt, who was the one, Elaine Bryant? 
[03:19:00]  Anita Bryant.  Anita Bryant, that twat.  She's from Florida, though.  Uh, uh, but where was she?  That was Florida.  No, but she also, but she went to California, I think, when Milk was running.  She fought all of that.  She was in the middle of that.  They're much more conservative.  They voted down gay rights a lot there.  It's because you always think of L.A. and Hollywood.  But you could get San Francisco.  Fresno.  And they motherfuckers.  Well, New York also is a state where upstate is very conservative and Republican.  Right.  But New York City, obviously very liberal.  But don't you, here's the thing.  Regardless of what I ideologically think of your, whatever I think of you, 
[03:19:30]  I respect that you believe what you're saying.  Like, I never get the sense.  Like, Palladino, I knew that motherfucker wasn't going to ever be governor, but I like  the fact that he said, basically, we said, fuck it, I'm an old, rich dude.  Here it is.  I'm giving it a whirl.  Right.  Here it is.  And I think it's, you know, I respect that.  I think that, you know, when I watch people and they kind of morph into whatever the kind  of focus group is telling them.  Yeah, the polls, the focus groups, the advisors, everything. 
[03:20:00]  It is always good to see a leader that, you know, what he's saying came from his own heart  or head.  And it might not be popular, but it's what he thinks, or she, sorry.  Right, right.  He.  He.  It's best for the country, the city, the state, whatever it is.  Because when you see some, it's so obvious when they're playing the polls and advisors  and they're using language that is so, just trying to maneuver around things to not offend 
[03:20:30]  and, yeah, be very neutral.  You can't respect that person.  If, like, I respect, like, we did this thing and they were talking about, I forgot what we  were talking about, but it was basically, if you could, one of the questions when I was  doing a radio show, if you could have a slave, would you?  If you could, would you?  Yeah, would you?  Would you?  Yes.  Yes, I would.  Sorry.  Yes.  If I was on Gilligan's Island, I'd fuck Marianne every day.  I don't want to fuck, well, there are no police here, bitch, this is how this goes.  Let's get to it. 
[03:21:00]  We got a club sort of candy.  We got, we pretty much have a slave.  I'm not saying they have to be black.  They said I wouldn't have a slave.  In general, yes.  Just a woman with a big cliff.  And I wouldn't beat them.  I wouldn't, like, I wouldn't.  No, I would actually treat my slave really well.  Indentured servants, more or less.  I would treat them really well.  But I'd have one.  It's a whole bunch of shit I don't want to do.  Do all my shit.  Are you crazy?  Are you fucking crazy?  Yes, of course.  No?  What is that?  Where did you learn that word from, honey?  No, I wouldn't.  You would say yes, obviously, right, dear?  You're a yes guy to that.  I would, I would, not only that, I would have all the fucking women I could have. 
[03:21:30]  I would be hedonistic.  I would, like, like, like, people always, like, they get mad.  Like, I remember when my wife was very religious and she was mad that Tiger Woods had sex with.  Tiger Woods is a billionaire.  If you marry a billionaire, except the fact he ain't just fucking you and move on.  You know what I'm saying?  David and Solomon in the Bible has several wives and several, concubines are hoes.  Biblical bitches, if you will, but hoes.  And so I think that this moral, there are very few animals that are monogamous in the, you know, in the animal kingdom. 
[03:22:00]  Like, I think it's horses and ducks, and that just means duck's pussy probably ain't that good.  Seahorses.  Right.  Seahorses.  Everybody else is.  That's it.  And who wants to fuck a duck?  I mean, so who cares?  I'd love one to lick my balls, though, because big, dopey bills.  You know why I'm nibbling with those bills, though?  Yeah.  Yeah, you fucking...  Well, I just like people, most people, most people would do, all of us want to be lazy.  Well, there's a lack of, like Jimmy said, just such a lack of honesty. 
[03:22:30]  Who would say no to that question?  A lot of people.  And you're just chastised to be honest.  No, but really mean it, though.  A lot of people.  Who?  Nah, no way.  A lot, man, I'm telling you.  No way.  It's one of the most...  Everybody on TV would say no, because they want their jobs, but most people would have  to say yes to that.  Yeah.  Somebody doing all your shit?  Yes.  Yeah, absolutely.  And you can't tell me no?  Would you treat your slave bad?  That's where I would say no.  Yeah.  They're doing all my shit.  I'm a fucker.  Well, bad is, you know...  Some of the horror stories you've heard over the years.  Yeah.  Nah, let's do... 
[03:23:00]  I know you don't want to do it.  I know.  I wouldn't either, but...  I wouldn't want to push you off this building, but let's get to it.  Yeah.  Just do it.  Get it on with.  I guess that comes with having a slave, though, because you're not paying them.  Yeah.  So now you've got to beat your slave?  Yeah, you've got to...  Meh.  Well, they're probably going to be pissed that they're not getting paid, right?  So...  So now what do you do?  Now there's going to be a problem.  Yeah.  Can I pay them a little bit just to keep them sort of happy?  Yeah.  Because that would be the ideal situation.  I think that would be something...  Room and board.  You'd have to kind of deal with your own conscience on that. 
[03:23:30]  Because I wouldn't be mean to anybody, but I definitely would...  What's the point of owning something if you don't let everybody know that it's your shit?  Like, I wouldn't, like, let them cluster together.  Hey, I think something bad's going on over there.  I wouldn't even let my wife read if I didn't have to.  Are you fucking crazy?  I wouldn't.  I swear.  You don't want to read and eat, pray, love?  I mean, when I grew up, people used to have a family on the other side of the town, 
[03:24:00]  and nobody ever knew about it until the funeral.  That's exhausting.  That sounds exhausting.  No.  It's so good.  See, white people, y'all call it big love.  We call it, that's my bitch in the other side.  I love the guys that have, like, two wives in two different states.  Really?  How the fuck do you pull that shit off?  Let me tell you something.  I'm not talking about, yeah, you're on the road, you're cheating.  I'm talking about two actual lives in two different states.  How do you pull that off?  I'll show you.  Can you turn those microphones off? 
[03:24:30]  God damn it, I'll give you a diagram to make a fucking head spin.  That sounds exhausting, though.  It is.  It is.  No, I mean, I wouldn't know, but I'm just saying, it is.  All right, all right, all right.  But I don't like when people, just like when you'll have conversations, it's almost impossible  to have a conversation with somebody where they don't first take their politically correct  tact and then, you know, decide what the answer's going to be from that.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Yeah, that is.  It really is irritating.  That is.  We just like snitch.  We're just a country of tattletale. 
[03:25:00]  We like snitching on each other.  Right.  Watching each other get in trouble.  But it's everybody, because nobody comes to the rescue of somebody whose private life  is being dragged all over the place.  So we're all fucking kind of guilty of it.  It's not just the people in the media, because nobody penalizes them for doing it.  So we all kind of just sit there and watch it and read it.  So we're all fucked up.  You know, that's one thing I want to, like when, I remember Charlie Sheen, all that shit  happened.  I love him.  He got drunk at it.  Motherfucker, his problem was getting drunk at that expensive hotel.  If he got drunk like that in the Ramada, nobody would have said shit. 
[03:25:30]  No one would.  Yeah.  Nobody would have said shit.  There's somebody next door getting all pissed off at the noise.  Here's your cookie, sir.  Now go back to your room, man.  You're a fuck.  Just pick the wrong place.  That's all.  And who wouldn't do what he's doing?  Yeah, man.  Making a million dollars a fucking week.  I do it, and I make a lot less.  I just don't do drugs, and I don't drink, so I'm fucking nice to hookers.  He can, and he does.  You don't do drugs or drink anymore.  I quit when I was 18.  Shit.  Yeah, I don't do it anymore.  No?  You're done, too? 
[03:26:00]  No.  We always said at 18, though, everyone's an asshole drinking.  How do you know at 18?  How do you know it's going to be a problem?  It's a problem for everybody at 18.  Jimmy's told the stories.  We agree with Jimmy.  No one at 18 drinks and goes, well, that's enough for me.  Right.  I got to get home.  No, you drink until you pass the fuck out.  Jimmy, you want to give another example?  Because then Jimmy shuts you up with the exam.  I remember walking down the street drunk with a butcher knife, hoping the police would  shoot me.  I mean, that's, so you know.  I was like, I was really suicidal.  That's a problem.  Yeah.  It's just suburban nonsense. 
[03:26:30]  You know, I, I, I, you're right.  I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, you wouldn't do that sober.  I'm a fucking liquor cabinet right now.  You wouldn't do that sober, obviously, right?  No, not at all.  Of course not.  I hope, you might.  No, I, because I would, I would remember that they had fucking nightsticks.  Right, right, right.  Oh, they don't have to necessarily shoot you.  They'll just beat the shit out of you.  Well, they'd give you a good, now they'd give you a good macing or tasering and just humiliate  you on fucking YouTube.  Oh, I'd love to see Jimmy just going, rah!  Yeah, shit, my pants.  I would react very badly.  I was, like, my, it's hard to have, like, my wife is the religious right. 
[03:27:00]  She goes to church all the time.  I don't really go, because that cover charge hides the motherfuckers.  But, uh, when, how often does she go, more than once a week?  Oh, shit, it's Bible studies when I come home.  The black church?  Yeah.  Well, they took a big hit when that, you know, pastor, Bishop Eddie Long.  Oh.  The gay.  He was a naughty one.  Gay?  Well, he was gay.  Oh, right, right, right, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what shocked me about, you know, he was having sex with his male parishioners, and  that really kind of shocked me, because that's, we have a lot of scandals in black churches,  but not like that, because, you know, I can understand in white churches, they got candles,  incense, wine, they're already on their knees, you know, I get that. 
[03:27:30]  Set up nice.  Nice and romantic.  Right, right, right.  Set up nice.  This is romantic.  But this dude, he was actually having sex with the male, and, and, and four young boys  got up, and they said he had sex, and I know he did it, because ain't four men gonna  have to sit up in court and point to a guy that fucked him.  They didn't.  And that was really hard for her, because she's like, you know, because I think that, you  know, the idea that, to me, I think all preachers are full of shit, most of them, like, nice 
[03:28:00]  guys, I like some of them.  I never go to church, because I think, at some point, I have to fight the urge to go,  this is bullshit, and walk out.  But, um, she, she was really troubled by that, and she, my children question a lot of, like,  I believe in God, I just don't believe everybody who says they work for him really do.  Like, I'm not paying 10% for the privilege, like, like, I don't, God wants 10%, well,  he knows where I live, can't he come pick it up with, fuck the  that he needs you for.  You're the middle man, yeah.  But it's always, and she, uh, that, and that's, so her ideas and my ideas really, you know, 
[03:28:30]  like, I think a lot of shit that she doesn't think, but the most, one of the most wonderful  human beings I've ever met, a great lay.  Wow, that must be a great lay.  That must be, uh.  She's still throwing a nice one.  I guess she.  And can make a hell of a pan of cornbread.  Do you steer clear of the conversations like, uh, left, right?  No.  Man, no.  No, she's right.  She's left.  You can't say anything bad about Obama around her.  Oh, okay.  Oh, really?  To this day?  At all.  She hasn't wavered at all? 
[03:29:00]  At all.  No.  Now, that's a conversation.  If I take that on, I have to decide whether I want to fuck or eat.  Oh, okay.  Like, if I, if I can have that conversation, if I'm leaving for Chicago the next morning.  Right.  Or Detroit.  Yeah, maybe it'll blow up by the time you get back.  Like, not just to be going on a, no, not a dinner going side.  I think it would be tough to be with someone that has different political views.  I really do.  Me and my wife have the same, and it just makes it a lot easier.  Because when I, when I'm at a family function and someone has a different political view than 
[03:29:30]  me, you can, you can feel the tension.  Like, really?  That's how you think?  Yeah, but I don't get mad at, I really don't get mad at that.  Yeah.  But you guys don't debate about it.  We, I believe, we're both liberal.  She's, she's less liberal than me, though.  I don't know.  It's more similar than, than others, I guess.  She's less liberal.  Like, like, Proposition 9, the thing that, for gay marriage, she's torn over.  A lot of religious people are very anti-gay marriage. 
[03:30:00]  You think God doesn't do it.  Yeah, I think the religion will throw you to, to the right a little bit there.  Even if you are liberal, you know.  And, and, and so that, that kind of thing, or, or where she believes that, um, like,  hell, and I don't, I don't believe in that.  I'm like, mm-hmm.  So you're gonna punish me forever because I like to fuck bitches and chase weed.  That are, that's some tough, tough rules to abide by.  She won't even, like, we have angels painted all over our house.  My wife painted angels in the fucking doors. 
[03:30:30]  Kids couldn't watch Harry Potter because, you know, it was a little.  Oh.  Yeah, demonic kind of thing.  We talked about she died today.  Withers and, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Goes against certain products we didn't have in the house.  Like what?  Like, uh, Procter & Gamble products.  She didn't, she didn't like that.  But that's like a rumor, isn't it?  Yeah, it was, but it was at our house.  She went, fuck that.  What does that mean about that?  Now that they're into Satanism.  Oh, they're not, though.  They're not.  Has that changed?  But she can't look at Harry Potter as just entertainment?  No.  Not even now.  You can't say, you, if I curse too much, she'll leave. 
[03:31:00]  D.L.  Hughley?  That's what I see.  D.L.  Hughley.  Do you say that ever?  You know who I am.  You know why?  Why don't you see the Sinbad's wife in China?  How about that?  You know where we're living?  You know where we're living because we curse?  Why don't you go see how that shit works out for you?  Wow.  Wait, did she see your act?  Did she come to shows?  Yeah.  Oh, she, okay.  She comes when it's important, but she won't just, and my wife will come in, like we, like  she, if I'm in New York, she'll come to New York, we'll hang out, but she's, but as far 
[03:31:30]  as I, whatever she tells me to do, I do the opposite of, because she's just a very, very  stunt.  She prays over every meal.  She has people, like I come in and it's a Bible group in there.  Oh, wow.  Really?  Now it's been 25 years.  Yeah.  Was it always like this, or you saw the change over the years?  She's always been.  Were you guys more similar when you first met?  I've always liked that.  Very interesting.  Like she'll smoke weed with me sometime, though.  Well, it's from the earth.  She'll get high.  It's from the earth.  God made the weed.  God made the weed.  She won't, she won't, like a threesome, that ain't gonna never happen. 
[03:32:00]  Really?  Yeah.  A lot of women are into that.  Yeah.  Threesome won't happen.  Not even for a big birthday?  That's what I say.  One of the big ones.  Not a lot of anal.  Not a lot?  Nah, not a lot of something.  Most chicken, you don't have to do that.  You don't have to be into God to not want your asshole shredded.  Like, we're home by ourselves.  The kid's out to college.  She still runs and closes the door.  I'm like, what the fuck is that shit?  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Because her father lives there.  I'm like, this motherfucker, he knows I'm knocking you off. 
[03:32:30]  You got three grandkids.  I'm knocking you off.  And none of them named Jesus.  What the fuck did you think happened?  Fuck, are you in town all week?  I am.  I leave.  You gotta come back later this week.  Yeah, I leave.  I'm just getting started.  I always love it here, man.  But you guys have the most racist boards.  What do they call them?  Message boards?  Message boards.  Oh, my God.  They're really bad.  We don't even go to them anymore.  I'm like, what the fuck?  Yeah.  DL's gonna be hard.  DL is always just a great comic. 
[03:33:00]  Loving fans.  Always topical material.  Two shows Friday.  This is December 10th, which is obviously, it's not this week.  Next week.  It's next week.  December 10th.  I'm just kidding.  Say hi.  11th and 12th.  That's pretty fucking cool, man.  And DL can probably come back before then.  But these shows will sell out because DL obviously does theaters.  And this is a comedy club.  So it's 212-757-4100 if you want to go see him, any of those shows.  There's a total of six shows. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah.  And one thing about DL, when you got the radio job, I got bummed out because I'm like,  God, that means he's not gonna be on our show as much.  But you know what I...  And you're gonna try to get back on, right?  I am.  But I would rather do this than that.  Satellite is by far the best person.  They should hire you tomorrow.  You just entertained us for an hour and a half like it was nothing.  I like that.  We did about 20 subjects.  They should hire you tomorrow.  All right.  Well, let's see if you...  Put a call in.  He works for free.  Well, tomorrow, it's funny.  Tomorrow's a big day here. 
[03:34:00]  Ozzy's in studio.  And so nice of the group to accompany to get him for us.  And I have a huge show going on sale tomorrow, which I...  It goes on sale Friday, which I'll announce tomorrow.  Yeah, that's great.  Do we find out if he's black tomorrow, too?  Yeah.  No, we want more by tomorrow.  Oh, like two weeks, I think it takes.  Yeah, we're gonna swab Sam tomorrow, but...  And you also have a big announcement?  Oh, yeah.  I have a big announcement.  Well, tell us the big announcement.  You really want to know what it is?  Absolutely.  All right.  Over to the Thanksgiving.  This is the OPNN Show.  OPNN 3.  OPNN 3.
