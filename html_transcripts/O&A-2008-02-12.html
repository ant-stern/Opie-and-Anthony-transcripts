<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a promotional montage highlighting its controversial nature, followed by the hosts, Opie and Anthony, complaining about being held to a “nice” standard in radio.  They then debated the worst day of the week, settling on Tuesday.  The conversation abruptly shifted to listener E-Rock, who frequently witnesses gruesome accidents.  E-Rock had emailed graphic photos of an elderly man killed by a bus, which the hosts described in detail, noting the incident’s unexpected connection to Oprah Winfrey and Gayle King through a newspaper article.  This led to a discussion of other listener-submitted stories of witnessed deaths and accidents, including a homeless person hit by a car and a woman run over at a truck stop. A caller jokingly suggested a movie title, “Fed Like Me,” and the hosts considered posting E-Rock’s photos on their website.

The show then veered into sports, covering Roger Clemens’ steroid scandal and Andy Pettitte’s testimony, as well as a lottery win by a convicted sex offender. A brief Black History Month segment was interrupted before a discussion of the David Shuster controversy at MSNBC, focusing on his use of “pimped out” regarding Chelsea Clinton.  The hosts dissected Keith Olbermann’s apology, comparing it to other political apologies.  Further discussion of E-Rock’s uncanny ability to witness death followed, along with a caller’s mention of a gruesome picture in a Boston newspaper showing a child with a facial deformity. The segment concluded with a replay of Keith Olbermann's explanation for his delayed response to the Don Imus controversy.

The next segment opened with the hosts viciously attacking an unnamed news personality, calling him derogatory names.  The conversation moved to a hockey player’s near-fatal throat laceration, detailed graphically, including the severed carotid artery and blood loss.  This led to comparisons with older hockey games and a discussion of past medical practices.  E-Rock was again mentioned, having witnessed a man hit by multiple vehicles; photos were slated for the website.  A nonsensical digression about the “worst year ever” ensued, with 1532 chosen. The topic then shifted to Sports Illustrated Swimsuit models, before studio guest Nick DiPaolo joined.  The discussion returned to the hockey player's injury and the quick response of medical personnel.

A large portion of the show focused on a 67-year-old retired math professor who nearly suffocated during a solo S&M session with a self-made device.  The hosts and callers discussed the incident in detail, with a caller sharing experiences with dominatrixes.  The hosts speculated on the psychology of S&M.  A brief Black History Month mention of George Washington Carver was followed by a discussion of the upcoming Knight Rider premiere at the Playboy Mansion, predicting a potential disaster involving Big A.  The hosts promoted DiPaolo’s stand-up show and a benefit show with Artie Lange and Louis C.K., concluding with a discussion of DiPaolo’s misquoted Sports Illustrated statement and political commentary about the upcoming presidential election and racial biases in voter support.


The following segment heavily featured the 2008 presidential election, with DiPaolo analyzing Obama, McCain, Hillary Clinton, and Huckabee, using crude jokes and comments about their appearances and weaknesses.  Demographic changes in the US were also discussed using offensive language.  Sean Hannity called in, shifting the discussion to political correctness, media bias, and attacks on politicians' children, particularly Chelsea Clinton. Hannity defended Opie and Anthony, discussing his political stances and disagreements with others, referencing the David Shuster controversy and his friendship with the hosts.  Hannity’s Newsweek cover was mentioned. The conversation then jumped to the Roger Clemens steroid scandal, with speculation and jokes, followed by a caller’s HGH experience.  Amy Ryan, actress from *Gone Baby Gone* and *The Wire*, called in to promote the film.

The next segment featured a phone interview with Amy Ryan, discussing *Gone Baby Gone*, the writers' strike, and her career.  The hosts engaged in sexually suggestive and offensive banter with Ryan, discussing accents, her crying abilities, and their acting opinions.  The conversation shifted to their stand-up experiences, referencing an old HBO special and Richie Gold, with numerous offensive jokes.  A Ron Paul political ad led to a debate about privacy and government surveillance, quickly devolving into offensive commentary.  A discussion of product failures followed, including Polavision, the Apple Lisa, and the Arch Deluxe, with vulgar and offensive jokes and tangents about distracted driving, the year 2000, and other comedians. Kenny, the hosts' road manager, was also mentioned with comments about his appearance and alleged past actions.

The final segment continued the comedic discussion of product failures, including McPizza, Betamax, New Coke, the IBM PC Junior, the DeLorean, and the Edsel, with humorous and vulgar commentary, tangents on pornography, racist and sexist jokes, and personal anecdotes. A caller attributed VHS's success to the pornography industry.  The hosts mocked a 1950s Edsel commercial with overtly racist and offensive remarks.  Patrice O'Neill's "Black Phil" was mentioned, along with listener calls, including one from Ben in Georgia.  Upcoming comedy shows featuring Nick DiPaolo were discussed, with the show concluding with DiPaolo filling in for the remainder and plans for the next day’s broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Shots, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  The controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jots, Opie and Anthony.  The world gives you strip club advice and then you go and see Little Mermaid the next day.  It's not like I went with a gay guy.  Your girlfriend did, it was you.  I think if you were touched inappropriately,  It would make it like a quick pop song, like the Beatles used to do. 
[00:01:00]  The love, love, me, don't.  Yeah, what?  I'd be like, shit, freeze!  Tell us what happened.  I had a patient who was a college student and was really, really depressed, and he killed himself.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Hey, hey, good morning. 
[00:01:30]  Good morning to you.  Hi.  Rise and shine.  Yeah, winter's finally here in New York City.  I just realized how much Tuesdays blow.  Why Tuesdays?  Because, like, Monday, it's a given that it just blows, and there's no false expectations about it. 
[00:02:00]  The weekend's over.  You're starting a whole new week from scratch.  And Wednesday, you get that hopeful little thing like, well, at least when the day's over, the next day is Thursday.  And we're honing in on that weekend.  But Tuesday is week filler.  It's just filler to make up the seven days.  It's the worst day of the week? 
[00:02:30]  I just, yeah, yeah.  Even though Monday is bad because it's like, you gotta restart, but you just know Monday sucks.  Yeah, but Monday, you're still in a haze.  Yeah.  You could go through Monday pretty easily because you're still like, you've still got some drugs and alcohol left over.  Yeah, maybe that's it, and you're dealing with that.  You're just like, you're in a little, a bit of a fog, a bit of haze around you.  There's just no illusions about Monday, you know?  Monday, we all know what it is. 
[00:03:00]  But the Tuesday thing is just, it's just there.  Wow.  You just gotta deal with it.  Great.  I really feel like being here now.  Thanks, Anthony.  Well, we make it special.  That's what I gotta tell ya.  Hey, ha ha, you're darn tootin'.  I got a special good morning today.  Did ye?  I wanna say good morning to the angel of death!  Yes.  Our own harbinger of doom era. 
[00:03:30]  Just call him the angel of death.  I see dead people.  Oh my God.  I see them all the time.  I leave from work or come into work.  For the people that linger longer,  Big!  You might remember.  It doesn't even resemble it anymore.  That's alright.  You might remember, how long was it?  Two weeks ago?  A mere two weeks ago?  You saw that horrific car accident in Hoboken?  A mere two weeks ago.  Where someone was missing their face and, right?  You remember her neck exploded. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, what was the story again?  You gotta do the quick version.  Two weeks ago, the angel of death, that's his new name, E-Rock.  Lady came speeding down an incline, plowed into five cars.  Her neck exploded and her face was missing.  That was it.  And she was dead.  Yeah.  How many people were dead in that one?  Two died.  Two died.  The car just missed you when it was going 70, 80 miles an hour, whatever it was doing, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So that made the paper. 
[00:04:30]  Not the big paper, though.  What?  The Hoboken local rag, whatever?  Yeah.  But E-Rock was there.  Yeah.  He was there.  The angel of death.  The angel of death.  Well, the angel of death has struck again yesterday.  Have you heard yet, Jimmy?  I'm reading this, and I'm assuming that Dreadful was there.  Well, we all got emails yesterday.  Fatso sent out an email to everybody.  Oh, my goodness.  And it included pictures. 
[00:05:00]  Yes.  This time, pictures.  Because last time we criticized him about his picture taking at the scene of the accident,  the big car wreck where two people died and the woman's neck exploded and her face was  gone or whatever the hell it was, we were like, E-Rock, you were right there.  Where are these pictures?  And he said he'd taken pictures.  And it's from like, I don't know, 30 yards, 50 yards away, and you can't see anything but  a car.  Not very compelling photographs. 
[00:05:30]  He took photos that any spectator could have taken.  Well, this time he got it right, Jimmy.  Well, he's getting better.  The Harbinger of Death.  No, the Angel of Death.  The Angel of Death.  Although Harbinger.  Yeah.  Pretty good.  Either one.  Harbinger of Doom.  Angel of Death.  He's getting better at taking his pictures because there he is.  There's an E-Rock photo of dead guy.  E-Rock saw someone get killed yesterday is what we're getting at.  I know it's a little too early for this.  People are just hitting their alarm clocks. 
[00:06:00]  But the Angel of Death, it's happened again.  E-Rock is faces of burgers.  E-Rock, tell your story before we read the official account from the New York Post.  Yeah.  On the corner of 57th and 8th, this old man was crossing.  This bus was taking off from the green light.  Funny, is it?  Well, it was a little bit.  Jesus.  Why was it funny?  The guy died.  The guy's dead. 
[00:06:30]  You didn't know what happened at first.  You just saw him stumbling around.  Ah.  The bus was taking off from the green light.  Didn't see the old gentleman there.  Knocked him over.  And as it was trying to build speed, ran over him with both sets of wheels from the bus.  In slow motion, pretty much.  It wasn't this high speed wham hit him.  He was in front of the bus.  I gather too close to the front of the bus for the driver to see him.  Yeah, it was on the driver's right, that far right corner. 
[00:07:00]  Wow.  The driver's right, right, the far right corner, kind of a blind spot.  Yeah.  And knocked him over, and then the front wheels ran him over.  Yes.  And then...  And the bus driver thought nothing of it.  He was taking off from the green light.  That's a bump in the road.  And started to accelerate when the back wheels ran over him.  Oh, that's the heavy part.  It's a bus.  It's all the heavy part.  People walking around ran out in front of the bus and was hitting the bus saying, stop, stop. 
[00:07:30]  The gentleman driving the bus gets out and starts yelling, what is he doing here?  How did he get here?  What's going on?  Trying to make him sound innocent.  Hey, I was just driving.  This guy threw himself under my bus.  What, did he just start freaking out?  He was just mad that there was a guy laying there, not that he ran over the person, just  saying, how did he get here?  Because he knows he's screwed.  Yeah.  Yeah, you can't continue being a bus driver if you killed someone.  No, and you killed someone like that.  It's not your fault.  They just got to kind of, you know, relocate you a little bit.  It sounds like it was his fault, though.  He didn't see the guy somehow. 
[00:08:00]  Look at his leg there.  There's like meat or a bone sticking out.  And he's laying there.  Face, his face is on the pavement.  Wow.  And there's about six pictures that he rocked hook.  And not, in one picture, he didn't move the whole time.  He's exactly laid out like he is.  Well, wasn't his finger twitching for a little bit or something you were saying?  And that cold-ass pavement kind of sucks.  Yeah, he was kind of, when the bus finally stopped, the old guy on the street was kind  of balled up.  And somebody had run over to him thinking they knew what they were doing, decided to straighten 
[00:08:30]  him out.  So why would anyone touch somebody under that circumstance?  He was all curled up, almost fetal position, except for the part that wasn't moving, that  it got run over.  Everyone knows.  You get him something, a blanket, you put over, and then you rifle through his pockets  for his valuables.  Started to straighten him out and laid his arms out on the side of him.  And when he did that, his right hand just kind of twitched for a second, and then it  stopped.  Oh, boy. 
[00:09:00]  And within a minute, there was a fire department and the EMTs were there.  Wow, that fast?  Yeah.  Well, somebody had flagged him down.  They were coming down the...  Yeah, they're always on 57th.  Yeah.  So the fire department ran over, looked at him, was waving.  They had an EMT there, and the first thing they did was, boom, blanket right on top of  him, and got something to pick him up, threw him in the EMT, and then got traffic moving  again.  Did they cover his head with the blanket, too?  The whole body.  Oh, okay.  So they knew he was dead.  He was dead.  He was done at that point.  At that point, they just need to hose down the area and move along, get the traffic 
[00:09:30]  moving.  Step lively.  Move along.  Wow.  So this is the email that E-Rock sent to everybody with pictures attached.  A perfect end of this day.  Leaving work and watching an old man slowly get run over by a bus that was taking off from  green light and didn't realize it clipped this gentleman who hadn't made it all the  way to the sidewalk.  Photos attached.  And we don't even know if the guy's dead or nothing.  That's all E-Rock writes.  These pictures are horrific. 
[00:10:00]  You can make money off these pictures.  Could have.  And then we opened up the paper a mere, what, hour ago, and the New York Post has it.  Has the story of what E-Rock saw yesterday afternoon.  Well, yeah.  E-Rock, did you sell any of these to the Post?  Why not?  No, I didn't.  Troll you.  I mean, it actually is a news story.  Yeah.  You could have made some bucks off of the poor old dead guy.  Yeah.  One day to do this.  Yeah.  We made some calls this morning, so we're waiting to hear back.  All right.  Good.  Well, I think they would still print this picture.  Pretty gruesome. 
[00:10:30]  Absolutely.  Well, the New York Post, the headline reads, fatally hit on way to Oprah Pal.  So he.  We'll learn a little more about this situation here.  This poor gentleman.  Uh, an elderly man who was delivering candy to Oprah Winfrey's best pal, Gayle King.  Oh, my God.  Was killed yesterday when he was struck by a cab and then a bus in Midtown.  So he was struck by a cab, then the bus.  Where was the train?  Jesus. 
[00:11:00]  Huh?  I didn't see the cab part first.  How many ways of public transportation can this guy get run over?  His head was also struck by an escalator and a clip by a plane wing.  Horse and carriage, right?  Yeah, one of those handsome cabs.  A delivery guy on his bike.  Just everything just rolling over this guy.  Harvey, uh, Katz.  Harvey?  Harvey Katz, 69, jumped out of the cab and was crossing in front of the bus on West 57th Street  between 8th and 9th Avenues just before 3.15 p.m.  The cab sideswiped Katz and he was pinned under the bus, the sources said. 
[00:11:30]  He wasn't moving, said Serena, 21, a student from Manhattan who was driving by.  He looked dead.  I'm still in shock right now.  Katz died at Bellevue Hospital.  He was delivering a box of candy to King, who works as an editor for, oh, the Oprah  magazine, which has offices nearby.  It was not known who sent the candy to King.  Uh, Winfrey and King have been friends for more than 30 years and, and have formed such  a close bond that the talk show queen felt compelled to deny rumors they were gay.  How does this make the story?  Why does that make it into the dead guy's story? 
[00:12:00]  In an interview in, uh, in the magazine.  It is amazing.  From this guy's death.  Yeah.  They tie Oprah...  Being a lesbo.  ...and she's not a lesbian.  Yeah, exactly.  Uh, a spokesman for the magazine could not immediately, uh, be reached.  So, there you have it.  Why do you need a spokesman for the magazine?  From the magazine.  For the guy that died getting run over by a bus.  Well, it just shows your life's not as important as the storyline that Oprah could possibly  be a lesbian.  That's the story.  Oh, look at that guy's face.  He's just laying on the cold pavement going, oh, it's so cold and I can't move because, 
[00:12:30]  uh, the Grim Reaper has his foot on my neck.  What do they think the magazine, they want a comment from the magazine, they're probably  going to say, it's a terrible tragedy, we send our condolences to his family, do you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are we going to say a prayer for his family?  Are you?  Are you?  Let's go to Brooklyn.  Look at that poor bastard.  Tommy, what's up?  Tommy.  Good morning, guys.  Listen, that guy's finger wasn't twitching.  No?  He was calling the angel of death.  Yeah, Iraq is the angel of death.  This is two...  Iraq. 
[00:13:00]  ...incidences that he...  Three?  What's the third one?  Third one was, uh, over the summer where, uh, my girl and I were in the car and we saw  the homeless guy, uh, get plowed into a windshield on 42nd and 9th.  Oh, right.  That was you, too?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  God, the angel of death.  Jeez, Iraq.  I forgot about that story.  That guy was okay, though.  He got...  He was just really mad, right?  Um, yeah, he was looking for his hat.  That's homeless people.  They're indestructible. 
[00:13:30]  Bums.  They really are.  You could run into them at any speed.  Yeah, he just wants his hat back.  They bounce off vehicles and get mad.  Start yelling at you.  Don't hit me with your car!  I want them on the stage!  Uh, Tippi Tom's family is looking for him.  They're starting instant feedback now, too.  We're trying to find Tippi Tom.  Uh, Steve from Bayshore.  Yeah.  Uh, movie title.  Fed like me.  Of course, instead of dead like me.  Yeah. 
[00:14:00]  Well, here comes the bit, I guess.  Fed like me.  He rocks the angel of death.  So, what are we doing with these pictures?  I hear they don't want them for onaradio.com.  No.  They won't post them up there.  Oh, no.  Can we post them up on our fine website that we can't promote?  Oh, that I believe we can do, yeah.  All right, we should do that immediately.  Because the pictures are, they're perfect, actually.  They're a little disturbing.  They're, you know, not too close, not too far.  Just kind of, it's a perfect picture, to be honest with you, for the newspaper. 
[00:14:30]  You see some meat on his leg.  A little bit.  But you could cover that up with a headline.  Yeah, you think?  Yeah, if you want to keep it a little cleaner.  A little meat coming out of the back of his leg there.  He was crushed, because you could see where his thigh meets the leg right there.  It really flattens out at that point.  And that probably caused some major, major injuries.  You know how much that, because his feet, he's on his stomach, but his feet are both  turned out opposite directions.  Like, that really happened.  People look really uncomfortable when they're run over by things or when they plummet from 
[00:15:00]  heights.  Right.  They look uncomfortable.  Oh, yeah.  By the way, there are four deaths that you've witnessed in Iraq.  You're forgetting one.  RG from Houston writes, the fourth one is your radio career.  Let's say hi to Max in Dallas.  Max, what's up?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  Was that guy that got hit by the bus, one of Lady Di's gentleman callers? 
[00:15:30]  Finger oners!  Oh, Max.  Well, even a linger longer doesn't save that.  Oh, no.  Let's go to Mike.  Hey.  All right.  Well, all right.  Okay.  He had a good line, too.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  That was a good line.  Okay.  Hey, front page of the paper.  By the way, it was, what did Iraq do with the box of chocolates?  Yeah.  Were they, Iraq?  Tasty?  Just snatch him out of the dead guy's hand and start picking at him?  You know, Gayle King had good chocolates coming. 
[00:16:00]  Of course.  From your lover, oh.  That guy made page nine of the paper today.  Front page, you're looking at, this is sad for Roger Clemens.  It's over, Johnny.  Andy Pettit's basically saying everything that McNamee has been saying is true.  That is basically the headline.  Wow.  And McNamee and Clemens will be facing off in what?  Is it a court officially? 
[00:16:30]  Facing off today about the steroid thing.  Yeah.  Some kind of hearing testimony crap.  But Andy Pettit, at this point, is trying to save his own ass, and he's basically saying  everything that Brian McNamee has been saying is accurate.  Yeah, you can't expect Andy Pettit to lie to Congress.  Right.  Your friends are not going down to prison.  Hey, help me out here.  Right.  That's kind of sad because they're so close that they have to deal with that.  Under oath, man.  Under oath, right.  That's a biggie, right?  Right?  He's a rat.  All right.  A whole family of rats. 
[00:17:00]  Let's say, we don't want to start the I saw someone get killed bit.  No.  It's just a thing with EROC today.  But we'll take one.  Bruce in Louisiana, it looks like.  Bruce, what's up?  Hey, I saw a woman get rammed over at a truck stop in Birmingham, Alabama a couple months ago.  Oh, yeah?  By a wheeler at the fuel.  It's pretty brutal.  Well, I would assume yes.  What happened, sir? 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, I don't think it would be jovial.  Let's go to Dave in Wisconsin.  Dave.  I wanted to know what Jim C's take was on this guy getting run over.  Hmm.  I don't know.  Did he see the pictures?  We have to wait until the autopsy comes in.  He had bus treads all through the back of his calves.  We're going to be knee deep in body, Sam, if this bus driver isn't stopped.  It was an explosion. 
[00:18:00]  An explosion.  And Jim C was there for some reason.  That old man fell.  Now, do you assume the driver might be charged with something?  The toxicology report shows he had gravy on his shirt.  It was murder.  Catchphrase Jimmy.  I'm going to see rules.  Two-line Jim C.  We're working all your catchphrases into this show today.  It's just...  Two-line Jim C. 
[00:18:30]  Two-line Jim C.  I know nothing else.  Sam has tiny genitals.  Somebody was murdered.  It's always murder.  Well, the old man was flattened.  How flat did he get, Jim C?  He looked like my girlfriend's head.  I went over, I crushed him.  Well, Quince, let me tell you.  Detective Monaghan, shut up.  You're ruining the scene again.  We like you better at speed in the other show.  That was speedy.  Well, yeah. 
[00:19:00]  Very good.  There you go.  Oh, they made a little Photoshop Jim C.  M.  Yeah?  And look, he's holding a little slide by a microscope.  I thought I left a plunger in the toilet.  It was only Al from Happy Days who was also on my other show.  Right.  Not this one.  The cop.  Well, there you go.  That's how we start today.  The Angel of Death.  E-Rock saw another person get killed.  Good one, E-Rock.  Two within the last two to three weeks.  That's wonderful.  Phone number 877-212-0. 
[00:19:30]  And phones are lit.  That's good.  We got lots to do today.  Black History Month.  Ooh.  We're going to replay yesterday's.  How many days left of that?  They've got to come up with another 10, I think.  Another 10 or 12.  Here's yesterday's honoree.  We'll have a brand new one later on this morning.  In honor of Black History Month,  the Opie and Anthony Show is honoring black heroes.  African-American individuals throughout history without whom this country would not be the melting pot it is today. 
[00:20:00]  Today we honor outspoken, loving mother and panel host on The View, Sherry Shepard.  Is the world flat?  Yes.  I don't know.  What do you think?  I never thought about it, Whoopi.  Is the world flat?  I never thought about it.  You never thought about whether the world was right?  No, because I, but I'll tell you what I've thought about, how I'm going to feed my child.  Well, you can do both.  How I'm going to take care of my family.  The world, is the world flat has never entered into, that has not been an important thing to me.  Sherry Shepard, your words never fall flat on our ears. 
[00:20:30]  I don't think anything predated Christians.  Stay tuned for more icons of black history on the Opie and Anthony Show.  We'll be right back. 
[00:21:00]  Turn it off.  Your death metal station.  Slayer.  What, too much?  A little.  A little too much?  A little too much this early.  If you're just tuning in, you just missed a great little break there. 
[00:21:30]  E-Rock witnessing someone dying on the streets of New York yesterday.  Again is the key here.  Yes, the angel of death, E-Rock.  E-Rock has more nicknames than anyone.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  All right, enough.  The angel of death.  People are trying to start their day.  Let's say hi to John.  Staten Island.  What's going on, John?  John.  I would just like to start the day by commending Anthony for his fastidious use of the beep 
[00:22:00]  this morning.  Ling-a-long-a.  Did you even use the beep?  The beep.  I did not use the beep.  You haven't used the beep yet, right?  I didn't beep.  Hey, Boston has had it tough the last week or two.  Yeah.  And Danny found a really, really bad Pat song.  Oh, I was listening.  Now, you might be saying yourself, but the Super Bowl was, what, 10 days ago at this point?  Nine days ago?  Yeah. 
[00:22:30]  Why bother?  They're trying to move on.  Well, the songs continue to come in.  Listen to this thing.  Yeah.  Oh, what's it to?  You sent your cameraman to shoot over teams.  Then stopped their futures fueling all your super dreams.  But now your dynasties come apart at the seams. 
[00:23:00]  You cheated.  You cheated.  You had us thinking you're as good as it gets.  But then your right-hand man went off to coach the Jets.  He flipped and now you're grilling on the charcoal briquettes.  You cheated.  And now your hoodie's all wet.  You cheated.  You cheated.  You cheated.  You cheated.  You thought you would go undefeated.  Went to the desert show in low class. 
[00:23:30]  That's where the Giants won't run your ass.  You cheated.  You cheated.  Do you get it?  You cheated.  Yeah.  You cheated.  Quite enough.  Oh, it sounds like Beat It.  Oh.  I thought it was an original.  You had a name from Commissioner Goodell.  But you forgot about Matt Walsh.  You were just injured to tell.  You cheated.  You cheated.  Then said it was all expected.  Someone is saying this is Michael Haxson. 
[00:24:00]  Now better check and go.  And better come back not needed.  You said you can't buy crap.  Oh.  Oh, that'll hurt.  Enough.  We get it.  Prep burger?  What is that?  Prep burger.  Wait a longer.  Stupid prep burger.  Just leave it alone at this point.  Right?  Yeah.  It's done.  We get it.  They lost.  Yeah.  The Giants won. 
[00:24:30]  Victory.  And they got a sex offender winning the lotto.  That's nice up there.  I heard about this one, Jimmy.  Boston's having it rough the last week or so.  Listen to this story.  In Massachusetts, a convicted sex offender could be facing new charges after winning a multi-million dollar lottery.  56-year-old Daniel Snay won $10 million from a scratch-off ticket he bought at a convenience store.  Snay, a level three sex offender who once lived in Connecticut, was convicted six times for assaults on children. 
[00:25:00]  Lottery officials say it's a legal win, but authorities in Connecticut are now considering filing felony charges against Snay for failing to notify officials when he moved back to Massachusetts.  Convicted six times.  How is he convicted?  Unless you get caught and then they go back and trace.  But do you actually get convicted for six different kids on six different occasions?  Yeah.  How does that happen?  Six times?  How are you still walking?  I know.  Around. 
[00:25:30]  Guys, your finger must smell like cotton candy and peeps.  Oh, my God.  I was going to set you up for another catchphrase, but that's a little rough, man.  It said his record of sexual assaults dates back to 1974.  So, you know, why did this guy, why is he walking the streets?  Going to be driving the streets in a nice limousine, as they say.  God almighty.  With his millions.  By a giant playland.  There's no, uh, there's no God, by the way.  No.  There's families, loving people, caring people, that are broke, that, uh, would love to win 
[00:26:00]  the lottery.  Probably play, pray to God, please let me win this week.  And here it is, level three sex offender guy.  He just pockets $10 million.  Here you go.  In reward of your, uh, child molestation, here you go.  Does he get to keep the money?  Uh, yeah.  It's a legal win, they said. 
[00:26:30]  But he can, uh, face felony charges for leaving the state.  Which they will get him on.  Oh, hell yeah.  So, this guy will be going back to jail.  We're going to fine you $10 million.  Right.  Hmm.  That's wonderful, right?  Great.  Let's say hi to Brian in Syracuse.  Brian, what's up?  Man, I don't understand you guys.  You guys are always constantly picking on these songs, man.  Now, I thought that song was absolutely wonderful.  Leave me longer. 
[00:27:00]  No, man.  I was beginning to get worried.  Have a look at that point.  No, no.  No, Syracuse gets the show.  We got a lot of people listening in the Syracuse area.  They stole $163 million worth of art, and I'm looking at the art.  It's...  It looks like crap.  Yeah.  Watercolors.  Expensive art really looks like garbage for some reason.  It's awful.  Like, the one person that's called Boy in the Red Waistcoat, and it's some kid with a 
[00:27:30]  way too long arm, just kind of leaning his head.  Way too long an arm?  Look at how long his arm is.  Oh, yeah.  That's stupid.  With a little head.  Whose arm is that?  Looks like it's been run over by a bus.  What happened to that guy's arm?  Must have been there.  That's his thing, though.  That's the artist's thing.  His thing is painting long arms?  I don't know.  You gotta have your thing if you're an artist.  Yeah, I guess so.  Here you go.  What?  Van Gogh and Monet, they were awful.  Really?  Yeah.  Were they?  Rockwell just painted a person. 
[00:28:00]  Hey, look, it's a kid at the counter.  Looks just like a kid at the counter.  Right.  Give you $10 million for it.  Yeah.  The eyeballs are in the right places instead of one on the forehead and one on his  elbow, you know.  Then they painted one at, like, a doctor's office, too.  Yeah.  With little kids on the bench and the doctor's talking to them.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Or the, yeah, at the drugstore.  The soda jerk.  Yeah.  At the drugstore.  It's a bit of Americana.  But this is good. 
[00:28:30]  Just a kid leaning on a desk and the right arm is too long.  Looks like Freddy in Nightmare on Elm Street when he's walking down the street and his arms  just...  With the big, long arms.  Yeah.  I don't know what dictates art prices.  I don't know.  I kind of like the poker playing dogs.  No, you don't.  I think that's a nice painting.  That's a hack joke at this point.  Of course it is.  No one actually likes that thing.  Of course it is.  What?  The original on that is worth a lot of money.  Oh, I'm sure.  Is it?  Was there an original?  Yeah.  It just came out of nowhere.  Speaking of hack, oh my God. 
[00:29:00]  I was watching the Rodney Dangerfield special from 1987.  Was that the good one?  The one with Dice on it.  Yeah.  It was like the first appearance of Dice pretty much anywhere.  Yep.  He gets up there and starts doing like his rhymes and no one knew.  You see him do it after a few years and everyone was yelling out the rhymes before he could do them.  They didn't know what was coming.  And I remember watching that and laughing my ass off going, oh my God, this guy is just hysterical. 
[00:29:30]  And you watch it now and it's kind of nostalgic.  But then they had some other comics on there that would just never made it.  Barry Sobel was on that one.  Barry Sobel was on it.  And, you know, he's doing his thing.  And he was the white guy that rapped.  He did the rap little act there.  Yo, what's up?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was, who else is in that one?  God, I'm trying to remember. 
[00:30:00]  I don't remember.  Was Jock off in that one?  No, no.  No, he wasn't on that.  Oh, Bill Hicks was in it.  Really?  Yeah, Bill Hicks was on that one.  The same one with Dice?  Yeah.  Who can it?  Yeah, Bill Hicks.  I know a lot about Bill Hicks, too.  I didn't know that.  Oh, well, see, here's Kenny.  Kenny can tell you the whole line.  Oh, Kenny.  Andrew was thirsty that day.  Yeah, yeah.  Schimmel.  Why do you always bend your six-foot-five frame down to where the microphone is?  It lifts right up nicely to you.  Dom Herrera.  I don't want to inconvenience the microphone. 
[00:30:30]  Well, just lift it up, please.  You're making everyone uncomfortable.  But I was like, oh, God.  There's, I go, oh, that old gag.  And it was, I guess, a new gag at the time.  People are roaring, laughing at some of the most hack things that would be, you know,  a comic wouldn't be called dead doing any of that material even ten years ago.  Well, it wasn't hack when they were doing it, though.  Yeah, but.  That's the key to the whole thing.  But you watch it and go, oh, that's where it came from.  You know, it's kind of like when you do a radio bit where you bomb a TV station with bra bombs.  You know, looking back, it certainly sounds hack. 
[00:31:00]  A little hacky, but.  But at the time.  For some reason, it made sense at the time.  Did it?  Did it really?  At the time, it got the men 18 or 34 a listening.  It certainly must have.  I remember when I was a kid, we used to watch the HBO.  The HBO Young Comedian Special and the Dangerfield Special were the big ones.  Yeah, yeah.  And Nick is coming in later.  DePaulo, he did one of those years ago.  I think he did one with Janine Garofalo.  Oh, really?  And I saw one when I was a little kid.  I was kind of young.  My mom, maybe like 1980-something.  And I never forgot this one guy on there that was really funny. 
[00:31:30]  It turns out his name was Larry Ambrose, who I kind of know now.  He's a funny dude.  And I watched the rest of the special that Alan King hosted recently.  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  Bad.  Larry was funny, though.  Like, his stuff, he was really young and new.  But, like, some of his stuff was really funny.  There's a burn victim joke.  Okay.  That's pretty risky for the time, right?  A stump joke, yeah.  But, I mean, there was one guy, like, from Canada, who, like, played the...  Ukulele or something?  No, the tennis racket.  Oh, the tennis racket.  Like, music?  Oof.  Oh. 
[00:32:00]  Ew.  With a funny hat on?  Oh, no, he didn't.  I don't know why he'd do it now.  A funny hat?  Yeah, like a wacky hat.  Oh, you know, crazy.  We'll try to find some of these for a minute.  Lenny Clark was on it, too.  And it was such a young Lenny Clark.  The guy was skinny, had a head full of dark hair, just, like, really young.  Very good.  Yeah.  We'll throw some of these on onaradio.com.  Very nostalgic, but not very funny. 
[00:32:30]  Let's say hi to Eddie on Long Island.  Eddie!  What's up, guys?  What's up?  I don't know much, man.  Um, basically just opened my eyes to some lovely news about the, um, the, uh, the perp,  the, uh, the kitty offender.  Who won the lotto up in Massachusetts, yeah.  Yes.  And, um, uh, the last, for the last two days, I've had, just had this extreme need to use  a word, and I think this is the perfect time.  Oh.  I, I think that this guy is just being very assiduous about his pedophile career. 
[00:33:00]  Assiduous.  You know, that's why he's able to keep going.  He's just, uh, um, well, I have assiduous in front of me right now on the computer,  so he's just being very unceasing, consistent, intelligent.  Well, in honor of Keith Oberman, that dope, we're trying to, like, uh, use bigger words  on this, on this radio show.  Assiduous.  Well, he loves using that word.  Seems to use it all the time.  Right.  But, but a jackass with his profound, and, uh, I don't know what his apology was.  I mean, it's, I keep thinking about it. 
[00:33:30]  It's been locked in my head for the last two days, guys.  Well, Keith Oberman, uh, is just a douche.  Uh, Sean Hannity actually, like, you know, came to the defense of, uh, David Schuster,  uh, last night on his fine TV show.  You know, a guy from Fox is, is explaining why it's okay that David Schuster, you know,  slipped and, and we should allow people to be able to slip as they're doing live, uh,  live commentary on TV or radio.  Uh, you know, he, uh, Sean Hannity basically said, look, you know, obviously it's not the, 
[00:34:00]  the, the, the, the best thing to say, but you got to give it to the guy.  You know, people just, you know, mess up from time to time.  It's far from the worst thing to say.  It's, it's not, I would say, I wouldn't even say it's not the best thing to say.  The guy was just commenting that he, he, he believes that the Clintons are pimping out  their daughter, uh, to call these superdelegates, which she needs.  Oh, does she need the superdelegates?  Yeah. 
[00:34:30]  Uh, yeah.  So all of a sudden this girl, uh, who hasn't been used in any capacity for, for either of  their political careers is now calling up superdelegates, dining with them, uh, she's  taken on a different role and it looked to this guy like she was being used by her parents  to, uh, help get the vote.  And, uh, if you want to use the expression pimped out, that's fine.  It's, it's part of, uh, the way people talk now. 
[00:35:00]  It doesn't, it doesn't literally mean pimping out for sex.  It means being used in some capacity, even though he was probably wrong.  Like they probably, they, they kind of kept her out of the limelight.  I don't think that they would push her into doing it.  She probably wanted to do it because she sees her mother getting her ass kicked.  Do you think?  Yeah, I really do.  I mean, cause there's other times where Chelsea Clinton could have probably been very helpful,  uh, when they were having public trouble and she kind of didn't.  Well, I, it seems to me that when, uh, Hillary was running for Senator of New York, uh, she 
[00:35:30]  didn't need the help.  She was pretty much a shoo-in and, um, you know, what would they need?  Chelsea for.  But now she really is hurting.  She's grabbing at straws, doing anything she can to get, uh, the vote.  She's on TV crying all the time.  Obama's ahead in the polls.  Yeah.  Obama's, uh, taking this thing away.  And they're using Chelsea to get, uh, you know, have her talk to the youth because a  lot of the youth are coming out and, uh, supporting Obama.  And I think, uh, personally that knowing the Clintons from what we've seen of their public 
[00:36:00]  life and, and some of their private life, uh, over so many years, these guys have been  in front of us for years that it does seem, uh, to be part of their MO to, uh, maybe get  their daughter out there and, and help out.  But, you know, she probably couldn't be bothered.  Uh, if you want to call it pimping out, why not?  Then Oberman just, uh, uh, just apologizing, groveling.  You know, and then you have Hannity saying the right thing and he doesn't even work for 
[00:36:30]  MSNBC.  No.  You know, you would think Hannity would just destroy, uh, you know, Schuster and all  that, but he actually, he actually, you know, stuck up for the guy.  Yeah.  Huh?  Hannity hates Oberman?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I'm sure he does.  But this is stupid Oberman once again.  No love lost there, I like to say.  He's just a smug douche.  Yeah.  He really is a smug, phony douche.  Smug douche.  I know what sucks about that?  Cause then, cause there's a whole thing going on on TV.  You got Bill O'Reilly and Oberman going at it. 
[00:37:00]  And I would love to like join the Bill O'Reilly camp, but he's a douche too.  They're, they're, they're, they're both douching it out.  They really are.  Douching it out in the ring.  Cause you know, when you hate one guy, you like to see who their competition is and then  you start supporting that other guy.  Yeah.  In this case, there's, it's a no win situation.  They're both douchey.  But Mr. Bush, you have hidden behind the general's skirts.  And today you've hidden behind the skirts.  Oh, this is him saying, all right, whatever.  Well, no, that was, what happened was when, when Schuster said it, he gave a, Oberman 
[00:37:30]  gave a self, a kind of a self.  Well, that's what I want to play for everybody again, Jimmy.  Grobbling apology.  Yeah.  Um, really implying that he was the, uh, the brilliant spokesperson for the network  who was just trying so hard to be that guy.  Yeah.  And then it turns out, he said almost the exact same thing about a general, uh, that  Bush was, he was pimping the guy out.  So he understands the common, uh, terminology of how it's used in the language today.  And Oberman didn't do it years ago.  He did it three or four months ago. 
[00:38:00]  September 2007.  And that's the biggest part of that is he does understand its usage in that context.  It doesn't mean a pimp, uh, pimping out a whore.  Right.  Like, instead of saying, Hey, maybe that was a little, that was probably a poor choice  of words the guy used, but we all know that you say things sometimes.  But we all make mistakes.  That's what Oberman should have said.  But instead he has to like say this crap.  Now you have probably heard that on this network yesterday, my colleague, David Schuster, discussing  Chelsea Clinton's role, a first for her in her mother's campaign, asked a guest, quote, 
[00:38:30]  doesn't it seem like Chelsea's sort of being pimped out in some weird sort of way?  The greatest possible respect for David Schuster's work, his reporting for this show and others  is assiduous and excellent and his political insight is keen.  All that being noted, it was still an utterly inappropriate and indefensible thing to say.  The Clintons have every right to be furious, hurt, and appalled.  Many of us here have similar reactions, ones that transcend political parties and politics  itself.  David has been suspended.  It remains only for me to apologize without limit to President Clinton, to Senator Clinton, 
[00:39:00]  and to Ms. Clinton on behalf of MSNBC.  We are literally, dreadfully sorry.  This old man will get his in the end.  Literally, dreadfully sorry.  What a douche.  He wants to be a member of that club so badly.  There are people that stand up in court after killing somebody driving drunk and don't apologize  to the family that much.  Literally, dreadfully.  Oh, I'm so sorry. 
[00:39:30]  By the way, assiduous is sharp, caustic.  Yes.  Like the taste of vinegar and water.  You douche.  Oh, he'll get his.  He'll get his in the end.  Glenn Beck had a nice little thing on this.  It was very interesting.  It's worth playing a clip of.  Yeah.  Now, listen.  Again, I think it comes back to the language and the choice of terms.  I don't think anyone, including the Clinton campaign, would object had Schuster said,  well, she's going to work on behalf of her mom, or even pointed out the inconsistencies. 
[00:40:00]  You know, Chelsea was asked for an interview by a nine-year-old reporter earlier and turned  him down.  So I wouldn't say it's quite a double standard, but she's certainly acting in an adult capacity  on behalf of the campaign.  It's the pimp comment that's the problem, I think.  Stop with the language.  It's driving me out of my mind.  Did you see the Grammys this weekend?  Man, one of the guys, does anybody know, who was the guy that was wearing the N-word  shirt?  It's, what's his name?  Boz?  Nas?  Boz?  Coz?  Whatever. 
[00:40:30]  We're wearing a teacher that had the N-word on it.  It was the name of his CD or his song or whatever the hell it is.  Double standard?  You bet.  I'm tired of the language police.  It's a guy saying, weird sort of pimping out.  He didn't mean she was turning trick.  When are we going to stop playing the victim card in America?  Well, never in politics, if that's what you're talking about.  That rocks.  There you go.  That makes sense, even though he sounded really silly. 
[00:41:00]  Isn't Glenn Beck the guy that was just doing the video about how he almost died in the  hospital?  Is he the one that was on, he had this really bad hospital experience?  Is that him?  How about playing the victim role?  Oh, really?  There was a blog he did or something where he was all doped out and depressed.  Yeah.  Wow.  I don't know if he was doped out.  I just made that up.  Did he rock?  Did he almost die?  Almost die?  Were you nearby?  You weren't nearby?  Oh, wow.  So, I just can't get enough of this Keith Olbermann, this douche. 
[00:41:30]  What a tool the guy is.  He really, really is.  He wants to have that moment where he sees Bill and Hillary and Bill goes, that was so  eloquent with you.  Thank you so much for sticking up for my family and stuff.  Oh, please, Mr. President, I would do that for anybody.  It's just about the morality of the whole thing and the, shut up.  You're talking, first of all, if you were talking to the president, you're talking to  a guy who did awful things with a cigar, an intern, and in the Oval Office. 
[00:42:00]  So, same pimping out.  Look what you did to a 21-year-old kid.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, how old is Chelsea now?  She's well over 21.  Yeah, that was someone's daughter.  That was someone's daughter.  Right.  And you're there with a cigar.  You want to talk about pimping out.  Ruining dresses and...  Take this, fatty.  Yeah.  I mean, come on, what about her?  Does he want to apologize? 
[00:42:30]  Is it dreadful and horrid and...  And then it comes from Olbermann who said pimping.  Said pimping in some commentary.  Pimping out.  Clinton's apology to Lewinsky was not nearly as grovelly and sincere.  No.  Olbermann's apology to the Clintons, and he didn't say it.  No.  Right.  After his lying that he never did anything with her.  I mean, come on.  You're dealing with the Clintons here.  Let's go to Chris in Pennsylvania.  Chris?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Jimmy's point.  One of the reasons they didn't apologize to Petraeus is they didn't need Petraeus for  an upcoming debate. 
[00:43:00]  Hillary's campaign was most emphatic that they're going to pull out of the next debate if  these guys didn't apologize.  No, you're right that that was motivated by the fact they wanted her because the debate  does get huge ratings on MSNBC.  Yeah.  That's absolutely right.  And pull out of the debate.  Yeah, exactly.  You got to stay strong as a network.  Let Obama just stand there.  Yeah, exactly.  Your old guy used the freaking term pimping.  And then you have him apologize.  That's so ridiculous.  And how about if you're so upset and appalled, Hillary was all upset and appalled and thought 
[00:43:30]  it was horrid.  How about if you become president and one of these savage nations wish death in horrible  ways on you and your family?  Because they do that.  That's what they do.  They make horrid comments about you and your family.  Right.  You're going to start crying and being sensitive and go to the UN and start going, hey, you  said bad things about me and my family.  No, you dropped bombs.  Lots of them.  But do you believe that she would threaten to pull out of a presidential debate because 
[00:44:00]  somebody at the network used a phrase that she didn't like?  Do you believe this moron?  Jimmy, it goes deeper than that.  I think she just doesn't understand how the youth of America talks.  She talks like she is clueless that this word pimping is is being used all over the place.  We had a couple of high school teachers.  They had a they had a jump off the phone lines, but they're saying, look, the kids are using  that term like it's the.  Yeah.  And she doesn't understand that.  She really thinks pimping meant, you know, get a pimp and she's going to be on a street 
[00:44:30]  corner somewhere with a lot of eye shadow.  You got my money, bitch.  Right.  You got my money, bitch, because I'll smack your face.  I'll slap it.  I swear.  There you're coming up a little short there, honey.  I think it's coming.  You're coming up a little short.  I think that Bill with the big hat with the feather in it.  I think it's going to hurt her in the end, man.  She doesn't understand how they're talking out there. 
[00:45:00]  Obama understands how they're talking out there.  That's why the youth are following Obama.  Very good.  I love that, man.  Damn.  We're right.  You're a little short yesterday.  I sure hope you're, uh, you're not short today.  You're a damn rat, ho.  Big sunglasses.  Gold-tipped cane.  So you can smack her on the ass. 
[00:45:30]  Now that's pimping her out.  Yeah.  Go make me money.  Shake that booty.  We took, uh, the David Schuster original comment about, uh, Chelsea being pimped out.  Mm-hmm.  We threw a little, uh, a few bleeps, beeps, whatever.  Yeah.  Into the audio.  And it sounds a lot, a lot better.  Yeah.  Listen to that.  A lot more sexy.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Listen to that.  And, um, Bill, there's just something a little bit unseemly to me that Chelsea's out there  c***ing celebrities saying c*** my mom.  And, apparently she's also c*** these superdelegates. 
[00:46:00]  Hey, she's c*** for her mom.  What's unseemly about that?  I mean, during the last campaign, the Bush twins were out c***ing for their dad.  I think it's great.  I think she's grown up in a political family.  She's got politics in her blood.  She loves her mom.  She thinks she'd make a great president.  Michelle Obama's out there for her husband, so.  But doesn't it seem like Chelsea's sort of being pimped out in some weird sort of way?  No.  She's there.  Listen, if she didn't want to c***, she wouldn't c***.  I mean, give Chelsea a break. 
[00:46:30]  I think it's great.  Again, Michelle Obama's out there c***ing for her husband.  What's the big deal?  Yeah, but the peeps make it a little different.  I like that.  It sounds like she's having sex with a lot of people.  It sure does, Anthony.  It sure does.  All right.  They just showed Siegfried and Roy.  I guess they're doing a performance for something.  Oh, boy.  And, uh, who was it?  Roy?  Is he the one that got mauled?  Yep.  Roy Horn.  He don't look too good still.  Oh, did that tiger F him up?  He still can't walk. 
[00:47:00]  No?  No.  He's like leaning on Siegfried.  Is that a new clip, though?  It kind of looked new.  Oof.  They're just English.  This is not going to get much better.  They're like waxed fruit.  They just sit on your coffee table and look the same in 40 years.  A little dust on them.  Let's say hi to Roland in Kansas.  Wow.  Kansas checking in?  What's up, Roland?  Not a whole lot, Opie.  How you doing, man?  Good, man.  Hey, I just wanted to say if, uh, if one of the Clintons, the other Clinton brother gets 
[00:47:30]  in office, maybe Keith Oberman's trying to get a press secretary job, right?  You know what?  He's, uh, Oberman is just, he wants to be accepted, like, as an, he wants, like, I think, uh, it  was either Oberyn said it, but he wants, uh, Bill to walk up to him and go, thank you  so much.  Yeah.  Well, Mr. President, and have that eye to eye, that heart to heart.  Like the way when he groveled for Jackie Jackson.  Just doing my job, because that's what, that's what I do.  It ain't gonna happen. 
[00:48:00]  Oberman's a creep, and he's like a, he's like a little wash woman.  Yep.  He's a little hen.  And he's a tattletale, too.  He really is.  Behind the scenes, Reverend Jackson, I was, yeah.  No one likes tattletales.  Girl, he's just constantly doing something behind the scenes.  He's ratting people out behind the scenes.  Right.  And then he gets on and talks about it.  I went behind the scenes and tattled.  That's real brave, considering you're on TV live every night.  Why don't you speak your mind, you know, then?  Ugh.  Because you weren't sure that, uh, your job would be safe if you did that. 
[00:48:30]  Ugh.  Everyone saw right through that.  Yeah, you know what?  When it came to Imus, he didn't come out and say something, because he didn't know what  the bosses were gonna do.  That's exactly right, Jimmy.  And that little worm didn't wanna, didn't wanna, uh, uh, uh, uh, say, what's the word?  Step out of line.  Do we have that over the clip?  Because we're obsessed with it, and, and we keep referring to it, and I, I don't know if  the listeners understand what we're, uh, we're saying here.  But when the whole Imus thing was going on, this guy was behind closed doors with the big  boss over at MSNBC, you know, being very vocal that this man needed to be fired. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  But he's on TV every night, and he kept his mouth shut.  And then when, then, then when it was obvious, Imus was done, fired, what have you, then he  went on his TV show and just, uh, you know, told the, the nation what he was doing behind  the scenes.  That is a worm.  That should get no respect.  But he actually, he didn't even just say it to the nation, he said it to, while the  Reverend Jackson was sitting there with his stupid wide, he looks like he'd been doing  meth for three days with those stupid eyes, and he knelt down with his mouth open, he's 
[00:49:30]  like, Reverend Jackson, oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, I was, oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, behind  the scenes.  Oh, it's just the worst.  We're trying to find the clip really fast.  Let's say hi to Rob in Boston, listening on BCN.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, oh, I know you read the Herald.  Yeah, absolutely.  You got to check out page two today.  It looks like a kid had a grapefruit embedded in his head, like his entire right side of  his face.  It looks like either like a pineapple or a grapefruit is just about ready to bust on through. 
[00:50:00]  Well, somebody better find that picture immediately.  Thank you, Rob.  We'll check it out.  What's wrong with the little fella?  Uh, some kind of malformation, but that's what's said in the article.  That's pretty damn obvious.  Yeah.  All right, cool.  But, you know, the Herald's pretty accurate in his reporting anyway.  Yeah, of course they are.  I mean, they're no better than the Post down here in New York.  They're pretty much the same paper.  Thank you, sir.  All right, guys.  Later.  See you.  All right. 
[00:50:30]  I can't find the clip, A-Rock.  It's coming.  It's coming, actually, or are you just saying that?  Because, you know, there's a lot here.  There's a lot here.  A-Rock's been kind of getting beaten up a lot lately.  Oh.  It's been thrown under the bus.  Exactly.  Just like his pal yesterday.  I was just doing an Eric impression.  Just laying there, not moving, with his chubby little face on the cement with a bus on top  of him.  I think something's going on.  The universe or something in E-Rock.  Because we beat the crap out of him.  And then he goes about his regular life and people are dying around him. 
[00:51:00]  Well, his regular life is striking people dead.  Yeah, the angel of death.  Yes.  He's Damien.  That's who he is.  He's Damien from The Omen.  He walks around upset and crows peck people's eyes out.  I know we're running late here, but this is worth...  It's all for you, E-Rock.  It's all for you, big buffet.  The guy throws a ring thing out the window and hangs him.  This is worth replaying because we refer to it all the time, okay?  When the whole Imas thing went down. 
[00:51:30]  This is why I completely hate Keith Overman.  There was a time I actually did like him.  I thought he did a great job on ESPN.  And when he first started on MSNBC, he wasn't that bad.  But something happened with this idiot.  Something happened.  I can't really put my finger on it.  But this really sealed the deal for me when Imas was in all that trouble.  And Imas was pretty much the star of MSNBC.  Let's not forget.  This is what Keith Overman actually said on his show.  Stipulating, sir, that I was one of those NBC employees who put it out to my bosses behind the scenes that this could not... 
[00:52:00]  Behind...  Behind the scenes.  This is what he said by pretty much the day or the day after Imas was fired or let go from MSNBC.  This guy has a show on TV every night.  Right.  Why didn't you say it then?  Because you weren't sure if the bosses would be on your side with this whole commentary.  And he was talking to Jesse Jackson, or as I call them, old South Park eyes.  Stipulating, sir, that I was one of those NBC employees who put it out to my bosses behind the scenes that this could not stand. 
[00:52:30]  Behind the scenes.  That this change involving Don Imas had to be made.  I can say that now.  I respected my employers and did not say it until they reached this conclusion, which I applaud sincerely.  Let me ask you again about the other people.  Is someone like Rush Limbaugh, how have they kept their time slots?  Will there be an increased effort to...  And now he wants to go after Rush Limbaugh?  You're just a douche.  You'll get yours in the end.  Does anybody see what this jerk-off is doing?  He's such a jerk-off.  He's a jerk-off.  He's a goody two-shoes. 
[00:53:00]  He really is just a jerk-off.  Like, I was behind the scenes.  He wants to be a hall monitor.  You're a news...  I don't know if he's a news anchor, but whatever you do...  Whatever it is, he does, yeah.  You sat behind...  Because you didn't want to go against your bosses?  That's the integrity you bring to your work?  You coward?  And you want respect from your viewers?  Ugh.  He wants to boss his head.  Either get them to contain themselves within the rounds of decency. 
[00:53:30]  Are they on the ropes?  Are they on probation because of this?  There must be a renewed sensitivity, and a broader public outcraft...  A broader public outcraft...  A broader public outcraft...  It's about women.  And that's why I'm glad Kim Gannon announced it up, because it's about mass misogynism.  It's about that.  Mass misogynism.  This guy is a blithering idiot.  He was going to run for president in 84.  Yeah. 
[00:54:00]  With the airwaves.  And those who are sponsors have some responsibility for what they're financing, what they're allowed  to be conveyed across the airwaves.  I have no idea what he said.  No one does.  No one ever knows what he's saying, yet he's revered.  Just stop with the Jesse Jackson Google-ize.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  Thanks.  Just thanks.  Stupid Overman.  He's awful.  Stupid Overman.  Stupid Overman.  Opie and Anthony.  Go. 
[00:54:30]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  God, you try to eat between breaks.  It's almost impossible.  I know.  We've got so many live reads during the commercials.  Can't get booed down our croats.  You always make me want to hear the song.  Rejoiners.  I'm putting a scrutter.  Yeah.  A kiss.  Absolutely.  I keep waiting for the words to kick in.  So I can play and listen to the words.  It's Opie and Anthony.  A hockey player dude is okay.  He almost died, though, huh? 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  Got his throat cut with a skate.  How many people watched that video over and over again yesterday?  That's pretty sick.  Pretty sick.  I was saying yesterday that it had to be the jugular.  How it was bleeding out.  Yeah.  But it was that other artery that's harder to pronounce.  Carotid artery.  Carotid, right.  Yeah.  The carotid artery was sliced almost completely in half.  Or completely through, I should say.  It was hanging by a thread.  What's the difference between that two? 
[00:55:30]  Anybody know?  I have no idea.  The one.  Well, yeah.  One is the major pipeline up to your head.  And the other one is a little branch off of it.  Carotid's a branch off?  The jugular is like, that pretty much feeds your head.  That's the...  Feeds your head.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's the artery that feeds your head.  He lost five units of blood.  They weren't sure at first if he would have a little brain damage from losing so much blood. 
[00:56:00]  But it looks like he's going to be okay.  Can't put a tourniquet on your neck.  Will he play again?  That's kind of rough.  Richard said Nick.  Yeah, I believe he's going to play again.  I don't think he'll play again this year.  I think you've got to kind of sit out the rest of the year if you have something like that happen.  I think you'd put a neck guard on or something.  At this point, they'd figure something out.  Because even happening a couple of times is too many.  Yeah.  You get out there and just go like, I am not going to want to...  I don't want this to happen. 
[00:56:30]  Those skates are so freaking sharp, man.  Yeah.  You would think you would cover everything on your body.  Those players in the old days were crazy.  They would just go out there with nothing.  Yeah.  Just their jerseys and skates.  I'm a huge hockey fan.  What I just don't understand, you watch the old hockey games and there's goalies without masks.  Like they couldn't figure that out.  They couldn't figure out that maybe they should like cover the faces of the goalies.  Just going to take a nice slapper right to the face. 
[00:57:00]  How stupid were our ancestors?  Pretty stupid.  They just couldn't figure that one out.  Did anything ever get hit in the mouth with a puck?  I'm sure it happened.  Oh, yeah.  That's why you saw a lot of them with no teeth.  Yeah.  All of them had no teeth.  So you got that going on.  In other news, well...  Oh, yes.  Baby girl has something to say.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Well, I just quickly looked up the difference between the jugular and the carotid.  Oh, is that why everyone's calling?  To give us knowledge?  We don't like knowledge!  What is it?  Knowledge is for queers.  That's right, Jimmy.  I'm with you. 
[00:57:30]  What is it, sir?  Well, the jugular is actually what brings deoxygenated blood back from the brain because  it's a vein.  Oh!  Whereas the carotid is what brings oxygen to the brain.  So it's just as important.  It is just as important.  If you put somebody in a sleeper hole, that's what you're cutting off the carotid artery.  Yeah.  What's the pop quiz?  Ow.  So that feeds your head.  Carotid feeds your head.  Yeah.  And then it goes up there and does what it does and jugular feeds your body.  That's correct.  Thank you.  You'd think they would have the same name but with vein or artery. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  Artery one, artery two.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why does everything have to be named after somebody?  I know.  Fred Carotid found it in 1050.  Named it after him.  It's always some 1050.  Yeah.  Bill Juggler used to go drinking together.  Yeah.  It's always some dumb year, too.  Oh.  And what I mean by dumb year, it's like 1050, like Jimmy said, or 1280 is a dumb year.  Kiss me the heebie-jeebies.  If it doesn't start with like 1700 or 18 or 19, it's just a dumb year. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  In 1060.  Right.  It's 1607.  His appendix burst.  Put a leech on him.  That's good.  Yeah.  Superstitious idiots.  Our ancestors were as dumb as they come, man.  Just dumb.  How are we even here?  How did they even remember to feed us?  We kind of know the difference with medical tech.  It's amazing what they would try.  He's got scurvy.  Put a hat of rocks on him.  A hat of rocks. 
[00:59:00]  They were just irrational.  Right.  They were just try anything.  Just take a stab at it.  It might work.  I can't move below me legs.  Push her head underwater.  Count to 50.  She's a witch.  Good.  Good thinking.  That's great.  How did we survive?  The bug should have taken over by now.  We were just stupid.  Exactly.  Here's another example.  They thought that the plague traveled.  We talked this the other day about through bad smell.  So to fight the plague, they made perfume. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  That'll work.  Yeah.  John, what's going on?  Put tulip bulbs between her toes.  She has a brain tumor.  In modern medicine, do we have anything that irrational?  I have cancer.  Well, here's a little hair gel.  I'm going to go for you.  John, what's up?  Actually, it's Sean.  But I just wonder if that's what happened to Erock.  Did his jugular get split and now the blood's just pulling up in his neck? 
[01:00:00]  Oh, wow.  Oh, that's...  I wouldn't mess with the angel of death if I was you, man.  One touch.  That's right.  Boo.  All right.  No, it's a good line, but we're a little scared of the angel of death because he saw someone  die yesterday.  By the way, if you're just waking up, page nine of the New York Post here in New York,  an old guy got run over by a bus and a cab and a delivery guy on a bicycle and one of  those...  What happened?  Yeah.  Erock witnessed the whole thing and he's got pictures that they don't have in the paper  that we're going to...  I think we're putting up on our website we can't promote. 
[01:00:30]  Thank you, sir.  Yeah.  1532.  Worst year ever.  That's what Lead Belly says.  Why?  1502?  1532.  I agree with him.  Oh, 32.  That was just a weird year.  It was partying.  What happened in the year 1532, Erock?  Can we Google that?  I want to see if it was the worst year ever.  Is that the year of the day?  Huh?  Is that our new bit?  Yeah.  Year of the day.  Year of the day.  Year of the day.  Year of the day. 
[01:01:00]  Year of the day.  I wasn't...  And then we tell you what happened in that stupid year.  I wasn't a fan of 1638 either.  I like 1638.  You did like 1638?  Why, Jimmy?  Because that's when the landing strip was first discovered.  The landing strip?  Yes.  Because explorers were getting lost looking for the good spot.  Ah, okay.  Where is that new man in the boat?  We're trying to find out what happened in the year 1532.  It's action.  Just a horrible year.  Action packed. 
[01:01:30]  Maybe something to do with the Magna Carta.  Awful document?  No, of course not.  I just like saying Magna Carta.  Yeah, here we go.  Francisco Pizarro lands on the northern coast of Peru.  Oh.  That's unimportant.  And Sir Thomas More resigns as Lord Chancellor of England.  All you had to do back then to be famous was take a boat and hit some land.  Yeah, that's it.  You just leave where you were born, take a boat, and go somewhere else, and you're famous. 
[01:02:00]  Here you go.  Civil War and Inca Empire begins.  See?  See?  1532 was just an awful year.  I've discovered a foreign land.  It's a beach.  There's people on it.  I'm claiming it for England.  Right.  But you can't.  People already live there.  No.  It's ours now.  Coney Island.  Yeah, I love the fact that Columbus just ignored that there were people already living where he discovered.  Well, when you build ships, and you go across the Atlantic like that, and you come from a culture and society where they're building things, and then you come here to the United States, and you have what amounts to savages running around. 
[01:02:30]  Sure.  Ah, you're going to pretty much go, ah, we're taking this.  Yeah.  We're taking it.  It's like, I always say, it's like the beginning of a monopoly back then.  You just buy, buy, buy.  I'll take that.  I'll take that.  That's what it was back then.  And then we kind of evened it out where, you know, occasionally some country will go in somewhere else and take it.  But for the most part, we're all divvied up right now. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  But then it was, you know, time to divvy it up.  You just grab what you could.  Yeah, but we're going to start, like, doing that with the planets out there.  Is that your latest theory?  Yeah, we're going to have, we're going to be, we're going to be kind of, you know.  Planet grab?  Yeah, planet grab.  Didn't they make some kind of treaty that says you can't claim the moon or planets?  Really?  Yeah, something like that.  Well, stop me.  If you get there.  Stop me.  It's pretty much, if you can't get there, you can't do it.  But the second you can get there. 
[01:03:30]  It's yours.  Planning a trip?  Who else is distracted by these supermodels?  Oh, my God.  The Sports Illustrated thing is coming out, right?  I think we got one of these fine young ladies coming in.  Really?  Later this week, I believe, yeah.  I think we booked one of them.  Oh, my God.  Look at them all strutting around.  Supermodels in bikinis on Squawk Box.  What's Squawk Box doing?  Redundant.  Look at this.  They have so much stuff on TV. 
[01:04:00]  We're looking at the models, and it says, coming up, supermodels in bikinis, and under  it, it's got the ticker.  Literally, a quarter of the screen is gone with just garbage.  Yeah, this temperature in Paris.  Frankfurt is, they're going to go up to 46 degrees today.  Who gives a crap?  They just have to make it look like you're missing something if you're not looking at  that strong screen.  It's nonstop, nobody needs it.  You ever look at the scroll so long that when you turn away, everything seems to be moving 
[01:04:30]  in the opposite direction of the scroll?  Yeah.  That's when you know you've been watching the news too long.  I've never looked at the scroll.  No.  There's nothing there.  Scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll.  It's all I ever look at.  Scroll, scroll.  How did you make out yesterday without your BlackBerry, Steve?  I made out just fine.  Did you?  I had so many phones.  Oh, okay.  It didn't matter.  See, the BlackBerry service went out yesterday, and it was very traumatic for a lot of people.  I was reading some stuff, and people very upset.  One guy was almost having a nervous breakdown on the train, saying that it interfered with 
[01:05:00]  his entire life, with the contact and communications with his wife, his kids.  He couldn't get any work done.  He was losing his mind.  Did the guy forget that there was a time in his life where he had to find a pay phone?  You get a pay phone and go, hi, honey.  Be home later.  Just relax.  When this stuff goes out, it's for a few hours tops.  What the hell would we do in a country where maybe through war or something else, we lose 
[01:05:30]  all this technology?  We have to step backwards.  Even 20 years.  I'm not talking like, oh, we got to go back 100 years where we're riding horses and stuff  like that.  20 years.  The world would be destroyed.  We would be out of our minds like cave people.  No computer at home.  Yeah.  No BlackBerrys. 
[01:06:00]  No communication.  No cell phones.  How did people used to meet before the internet?  No navigation systems in the cars.  How did people meet before the internet?  I have no idea.  We lived through that, and I don't even remember.  With radio shows.  Everyone needed a radio show or something.  No clue.  Carlin had a great bit about how if you want to drive people back into savagery, just remove  electricity.  Oh, yeah.  It would shut down everything.  It would take a day, too, by the way.  It would be instant. 
[01:06:30]  You think it would be complete anarchy, people killing each other?  Oh, yeah.  We would be cavemen immediately.  Just no way to communicate?  You know when they had the blackouts every once in a while here in Manhattan?  Yeah.  They'd get the lights on just in time.  You could just feel it.  And there's such a huge police presence, but that would be gone if there was no electricity.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  You'd just kind of lose all electricity.  Wow.  That would be pretty wild.  Because the police, man, they're human, too.  You know, after a day or two of no communication electricity, they're starting to think, look 
[01:07:00]  that's what I could get.  There's a lot of free stuff around.  All right.  We've got to take a break because we went a little late talking about that douche Keith  Doberman.  We've got Nick DiPaolo coming in?  Yes.  Very cool.  And we go to break with an Oscar moment.  The O.B.  and Anthony Show presents Oscar Moments.  Memorable scenes from Academy Award-nominated films.  Today's Oscar moment comes from No Country for Old Men.  Well, look, I need to know where I stand to win. 
[01:07:30]  Everything.  How's that?  You stand to win everything.  Call it.  All right.  Head's in.  Well done.  Don't put it in your pocket.  Sir?  Don't put it in your pocket.  It's your lucky quarter.  Stay tuned for more Oscar Moments presented by The O.B.  and Anthony Show.  Hey, good morning. 
[01:08:00]  O.B.  and Anthony on your radio doll.  Got Nick DiPaolo in studio.  Hi, fellas.  Forgotta this weekend.  Forgotta this weekend.  Nice.  Very nice.  And Nick came in here, and we were just talking about, like, guys almost dying on the ice.  Yeah.  Because we're all looking at that freaking video from yesterday.  Amazing.  And you were talking about the goalie, the Sabres goalie.  Andrew Chukka.  Howard Chukka.  I don't know if he remembers, but...  Somebody Chuck.  That was the...  And, yeah, they said the only reason he lived is the emergency room in the rink was at the 
[01:08:30]  same end of the rink he was at.  Wow.  They said it was literally seconds.  Wow.  You think they might put on a couple turtlenecks or something?  Yeah, something.  Protect your neck.  You know that cardboard thing that comes in a new shirt?  Leave that in there.  Leave it in the collar.  I got a nephew.  He plays youth hockey, and you got to wear, you know, you got to protect your neck.  Oh, yeah.  But for some reason, the NHL guys, they didn't learn the lesson when the Chuck guy from the  Sabres almost bled out.  They got, like, white beaters on, you know. 
[01:09:00]  That'll protect me.  Yeah, no kidding.  I mean, we've all been cut before, but could you imagine getting cut like he did yesterday  or two days ago, knowing you have 10 minutes to live, unless someone knows what the hell  they're doing?  No, I just...  What do you do there?  I'm just...  Because there's more info coming out.  That artery was hanging by a thread, so it was pretty much cut right through.  Oh!  So how do they save this guy's life?  Needle and thread.  Like, what do they do, like, in the locker room? 
[01:09:30]  What do they do?  Did they clamp it off or something?  They have to.  But what's creepy is one of the guys that saved them helped save the Buffalo Bills football  player who broke his neck.  Wow.  Oh, really?  Yes!  The guy in a crisis.  This guy, really?  Yeah.  That or he's just bad luck.  Look at that blood just spray on the ice.  Let me see.  It's amazing how that...  Yeah, Zednik, obviously.  We know that.  What's weird is he's falling forward and the blood still hits the ice before he does.  Look at that.  Instant. 
[01:10:00]  And then the blood sprays.  Oh!  Oh, goodness.  And he's going to be all right.  That's just one pump of blood, too.  And I was saying yesterday, he's playing hockey.  So you know his heart was just going...  Exactly!  Just pumping it out.  That makes it worse if you're an athlete in good shape.  Yeah.  You're better off being a fat bastard.  Yeah.  With a cholesterol problem.  With a cholesterol problem.  19 beats per minute.  With steak fat caught in that artery.  It's just bubbling out slowly.  It's like a self-sealing tire. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  It's got that crap in it.  Right.  Yeah.  If that was Dick Cheney, he would have seen like three pieces of pork fly on the ice.  Motor oil and...  Right on, man.  That has to scare the...  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You could tell the guy was all shaken up.  He grabbed his neck and then you start skating over to the side and you're probably thinking,  well, that's it.  Hockey's brutal for that.  I mean...  Yeah.  I played like...  I messed around in high school.  I went out for JVs.  I played like football and baseball.  Just to stay in shape, I played a year of JV hockey. 
[01:11:00]  During tryouts, I got a goalie stick in the face.  Supposed to have my helmet on.  I went out without even my forgetting.  I was like nervous.  It was like a...  I could call him a goalie stick and then we scrimmaged the teachers after school once  and this is like my freshman year, just messing around.  My metal shop teacher accidentally caught me with a stick and I'm skating around and I  look over and there's all these kids in the bleachers going like this and I'm like...  I saw my reflection in the glass.  I was just covered because when you cut your head, it just gushes. 
[01:11:30]  It was right on the hairline.  Yeah.  The wrestlers learned that less than a while ago.  Yeah.  Makes it look really bad.  You want to talk about embarrassing?  I got my head split up and...  Oh, this is a douchey.  I was trying to catch a baseball and I was such a girl.  It shot right...  It was a pop fly and it went right past my glove and bounced off my face.  Did it go...  Make that sound?  That three stooges knock sound?  It split my head and I lifted my hat and blood rushed down my face.  So I walked home and I'm laying on my bathroom floor and the ambulance came. 
[01:12:00]  I was like a little woozy so they're putting me on the stretcher and I said to the people,  pray for me.  No, you didn't.  I just remembered that when Nick said...  The doc is like I would, but I'm Jewish.  Pray for me.  Pray for me.  I just got shot in a gun battle.  What did you mean?  I don't know, but I thought I was dying and we should all get together and just, I don't 
[01:12:30]  know.  From a baseball hit in your head?  I know.  A pop fly.  It wasn't like it was a zombie.  A liner to the throat.  It was a Rod Carew blooper to split my little faggity head on.  Texas Lager?  That's wonderful.  You're really bleeping the head.  Pray for me.  Pray for me.  I want to get to Jeff in North Carolina.  Jeff, what's up?  Hey, old Pat.  Little Jimmy.  How you guys doing?  Good.  Yeah, I just wanted to let you guys know how crazy these old-timers are.  I know you were talking about it.  My grandfather was a semi-pro goaltender back in his youth, and he didn't wear a helmet 
[01:13:00]  in goal.  And he said, when I asked him why, he said, if you can't get your head out of the way  in the puck, you got no business being in the net in the first place.  Yeah, we were talking about goaltenders without the...  Gomp Worsley was the last one.  Remember?  Really?  This is how old they...  Gomp Worsley?  Do you remember Minnesota North Stars?  No.  He had a face like Shemp from the Stooges.  And everyone else was wearing the goalie mask, and he refused, because he's like, look, 
[01:13:30]  I'm the last one.  Yes!  I was like 10, 8, 10 years old, I remember.  Him not having a...  Wow.  That's crazy.  That really is crazy.  You should pull him up if you Google him.  I bet you have a picture of his scarred face.  How do you sit there and let him just fire pucks at your face?  Yeah, exactly.  Insane.  Let's go to Lake Placid.  This must be about hockey.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, how's it going today, fellas?  Yeah, what's up, Chris?  Well, no, there was some good crying audio of Clint Malarchuk the day after he got... 
[01:14:00]  Malarchuk, that's it.  ...after he got kicked in the throat.  Okay, we've got to find the crying audio.  We love crying audio on this show.  He was pretty busted up, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  That's right.  That's his name, Malarchuk.  Malarchuk.  I think he's a heavy chock or whatever.  Wouldn't you be?  I'll be happy in another question.  Yeah.  How the hell do you go to a North Carolina call for hockey before Lake Placid, New York?  Oh, boy.  You're right, too, because you were both on the line at the same time.  Oh, you're killing me.  I can hear the hockey in your voice. 
[01:14:30]  And keep your nephew in it, man.  It's a great game.  Keep him in it.  Yeah, he's pretty good, too.  He's all right.  Look at his hockey head.  Yeah, but you want people coming from Long Island are not going to make the NHL.  I'm sorry.  No?  I don't know, though.  There's a lot of puck down there, man.  Yeah.  All right.  A lot of puck, anything?  A lot of puck.  A lot of puck.  This guy is all about hockey.  Jesus, this is he ever.  Just all about hockey.  Keep that kid in the game.  It's a good game.  You get your throat slit.  It's wonderful.  My nephew plays three or four sports, and I don't know if it's going to be hockey, because 
[01:15:00]  I lived in Buffalo.  They have an advantage up there.  They're playing on frozen lakes all over the place.  On Long Island, you've got to rent a rink at four in the morning to try to practice.  That's exactly right.  That's why you don't see a lot of Long Islanders making the NHL.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  I'm looking at the S&M guy who almost died.  Yeah.  I'm just reading about what he enjoyed.  I just don't know how you enjoy that.  Well, the story...  And they're coming from you.  That's amazing.  Yeah, exactly.  You want to send shivers through me when you said that.  Get everyone on board, Jimmy. 
[01:15:30]  This story happened over the weekend.  This guy, I think he's from Quebec or something like that, Canada.  And he comes down to New York, and he's a regular at the S&M Club.  The idea is it was Richard Benjamin, which is also an actor.  Oh, yeah.  Richard Benjamin.  Richard Benjamin, yeah.  That's right.  Every bad movie, like Simon, all those movies.  Goodbye, Columbus.  Yeah.  Seeing that one.  He made Gutenberg look like Marlon Brando.  He really was a fool.  What a chooch.  And he was 67, married for many years, retired after 30 years, math professor. 
[01:16:00]  And his wife had no idea, but they said he was in an S&M contraption.  And this is what it was.  The ex-professor, whose hands were bound behind him, had a leather collar around his neck that  was attached to a rope, secured to a hook on the ceiling.  He was wearing nipple clamps, and his feet were in women's high heels.  And I'm like, look, I'm a filth bag, but how do you enjoy, how do you like finally get  that and go, all right, here, this is exactly where I'm going to do it.  That's perfect.  The most painful part of that is the women's high heels. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, I know.  That's a weird combination of things.  I know.  I like an executioner's hat and a stole.  Right.  Right.  Maybe I'm choking when one of his feet slipped out of the tall shoe.  How do you tell your adult son that?  What happened, Dad?  Well, when I was being tied up, I slipped out of the ladies' footwear.  So this guy was precariously perched on high heels in a way where if he wasn't, he would  be choking.  And then he falls out of one of the heels, and that's just enough to get him choking. 
[01:17:00]  You mean he, like, hanged?  Is he dead?  No, he's alive, but he's in some kind of a...  I think he started talking.  I'm a hawk, Jimmy.  Oh, did he?  I think the update is he's talking.  I heard he was feeling better and may have identified himself.  That's like Tuco at the end of Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.  Standing on the cross there.  Blondie!  My high heel, Blondie!  I never understood that.  Yes, and I'm dying.  I never got that.  No. 
[01:17:30]  We got into it yesterday.  We were trying to understand that whole thing.  Never.  When we've had dominatrix come in and they try to pull that crap, they have the crap, and  they're like, bend over you.  And I go, no.  You've been a bad boy.  I'm not going to do that.  And then they go, move on to somebody else, because I find no pleasure in this dominating  woman.  I spent time with my mother until I was like 18.  Why do I want to have a dominating woman that's now going to be there for my sexual favors? 
[01:18:00]  The whole S&M thing.  They always go, there's a fine line between pain and pleasure.  Yeah, I'm always confused in, you know, stubbing my toe with a handjob.  I don't know if I can say that.  That's all right.  Somebody heard it.  Oh, that's funny.  Yeah.  This is what happened.  What a weirdo.  She said she would check on him every 20 minutes.  He would just hang there alone in the room for hours.  Roast?  For hours.  She would get a roast.  She used to have a check on him.  I'll baste you every 20 minutes, you fool. 
[01:18:30]  What does he do?  Just set it and forget it.  Have you a romp of peel in the room?  What are you thinking about?  But he didn't even want her in the room?  Like, 20 minutes, she'd come in.  No, it wasn't about it.  He would just hang there and do what?  I don't know.  If you're stupid, hopefully.  And think about the election.  After a while, you've just got to see.  Yeah, what are you thinking about?  The election.  Who's going to get those superdelegates?  You know, I really should start working out.  Nipple clip is coming off.  Right.  Hello? 
[01:19:00]  It's been 20.  What do you think about?  I don't know.  Like, how good do you need to feel?  That's just shame.  You absolutely have to just want shame.  Because you're not even distracted by the woman being in there anymore.  I disagree with you.  Because the shame part, wouldn't that be if someone was watching this whole scene?  But if you're doing it alone, where's the shame come in?  I don't know.  I think the woman makes a distraction.  I think she's, like, part of the game.  I think the shame comes in when the story comes out in the post. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, that's probably when the most shame comes in.  And they mention you by name and what you did for a living.  And your neighbor's like, oh.  Let's say hi to Doug.  What's up, Doug?  Yeah, hey, during the worst of hour today, you should play Opie making the Dom cry.  Ding, ding.  Yeah, Ron and Fez were doing this fine radio show.  They had a dominatrix come in.  Oh, yeah?  And she was trying to do all that stuff Anthony was talking about.  Like, you've been a bad boy.  Bend over and take your spanking.  And I'm just like, ugh. 
[01:20:00]  And to make a long story short, I got her to cry and run out of the studio.  Did you?  In tears, yes.  What did you do?  He told her she looked like Joey Ramone.  And she did.  She really did.  She must have heard it, like, all the time.  She was a dominatrix.  Yeah.  You're all tough and stuff.  Yeah.  See, that's how women are.  You go, you can make them cry.  You're a dominatrix.  She does all this.  Yeah, you look like a, you're ugly.  I don't need this.  Hey, come back.  You forgot your crop, tough guy.  Yeah, she does all this horrific stuff. 
[01:20:30]  And that's what got her.  Yeah, all that nickel clamps and.  Oh, I love this.  It all goes out the window.  I love that one.  They just become the little girls.  You've been a bad boy.  Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock and roll high school.  Gobba, gobba, hey.  Start crying.  Let's say hi to Paul on Long Island.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I just wanted to say it wasn't the shame of hanging there.  It was that he could have the fear of hanging himself. 
[01:21:00]  If he's precariously perched, as Anthony so pointed out, on the high heels, then it was  that fear and anticipation of hanging himself that got him off.  But I mean, but that's a weird.  I'm a pervert.  I don't understand that.  Like, I understand, like, liking exotic things.  But so, like, ooh, I'm almost going to hang myself.  Yeah, I'm almost dead.  What is it with the choking and the sex is a connection, you know?  Because that's what the young kids do today.  Oh, the kids.  I always used to choke girls when I was having sex with them.  But it wasn't, you know. 
[01:21:30]  Auto-erotic asphyxiation.  They weren't asking for it.  Crap shoot.  Some like it.  Some don't.  I spilled wine on my rug.  I don't get it.  Nothing worse than a dominatrix.  I can't read you.  Because I've seen enough of it.  I'm a fetish guy.  I'm not a submissive.  But when you're like, why don't I clear that up, Jimmy?  Well, there's a big difference, though.  Because I would walk in and they'd go, hello, slave.  Oh, shut up.  Just use me as a toilet and move on.  You see through the...  Jimmy sees through their bad acting. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, it's hilarious.  Hello, slave.  In an Ed Wood movie.  Oh, no.  Tor Johnson's going to spank me.  Shut up, awful.  Hello, slave.  A big man would spank him like that.  He would have trouble going through a door like that with high heels.  I like to wear women's clothing.  Hello, slave.  Oh, God.  One said that to me.  Hello, slave.  I would openly laugh.  Would you want to lick my boots?  And I was licking her boots going, this sucks.  Licking her boots.  Licking her boots.  The side of them.  I would never lick the bottom.  But licking the side...  Oh, who does that, though? 
[01:22:30]  I'm a bad mistress.  You got me.  What?  Call me a traditionalist.  I like having certain parts touched.  Repeat.  You know?  Stuff like that.  I don't need kissing boots or being whipped.  Here, chew on my handbag.  What?  What the hell is that exactly?  Nothing worse than a dominatrix to me.  It's not sexy.  I don't get it.  I've never seen a good-looking one.  They're always these haggard, kind of, you know, a little too old, a little too witchy-poo-looking. 
[01:23:00]  And then they got to cover that up by being the tough guy.  Always in charge.  I used to see one.  I've seen a couple over the years who were, wow.  And I mean smoking really good.  But most of them are awful.  But there's a few that are, when they're good, they're really good.  But when they're horrible, they're brutal.  I don't know.  With that old frigate.  They look like Dean Wormer's wife dressed up with a big pointy bra.  And those stockings, you know, that just smell. 
[01:23:30]  Perfect reference.  Oh, wait.  Wait, something's going on with Jimmy.  Years ago, I went to see one.  I saw it in the back of the New York press.  It was, have you been a bad boy?  And her name was Miss Park.  Oh, my gosh.  It's a sexy name.  She was going to spank me.  And I went to her.  And I forget where she was.  And I walk in.  And it was an old lady.  She was an old lady with glasses.  And I felt so stupid.  And so she starts spanking me and trying to talk dirty about, like, you've been bad. 
[01:24:00]  And she's like, look at how big that thing is.  And it was like an acorn.  I was so not turned on.  And then she gives me baby oil, which is the worst to use.  She's talking dirty.  And she's an old lady.  Or is she talking about, like, the Truman administration?  Dude.  Honest to God, we were talking about something.  And she mentioned Reagan.  I don't remember what it was.  Wow.  I swear to you, the words were not Reagan.  As an old lover?  The trickle-down effect.  And that's Miss Park.  And I had to go see my girlfriend and her friend at the time. 
[01:24:30]  And I just kind of stopped.  I'm like, I can't do this.  Think she's still alive, though, bro?  I hope not.  She was a terrible, dumb, naughty boy.  This is really good talk.  And phones are just nothing.  No one wants to be involved with this one.  I never did that.  I don't know.  Right.  No one wants in on this one.  Oh, they know the number.  877-212-O-N-A.  They just want to keep it to themselves.  It's hilarious.  Yeah.  And Harry's a little confused.  He goes, we get it, Opie.  Anything other than a BJ?  Could you say that?  Yeah.  All right.  Or straight vanilla sex is yucky. 
[01:25:00]  That's not what I'm saying.  Who said that?  That's what I'm saying.  And I was the one saying, I kind of like, you know.  I just don't understand the whole S&M thing.  That's all.  And no one can explain it to me.  I don't get it.  It's a chance to be.  Like, the girls are the most submissive are the ones that are, like, powerful women.  Like, I think a lot of times people want sex to be where they can really let go.  Like, a lot of cops and judges are big submissive because they're powerful all day.  And that's the same.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't see the turn on them being somebody telling me what to do.  It must be the Italian guy.  Yeah.  Shut your mouth. 
[01:25:30]  Shut up.  Now clean it up.  That's right.  Hanging high heels just like your father.  I don't see the connection there.  No.  You know?  No.  Your girlfriend busts your balls to your wife.  You get turned on?  No.  Shut up.  Shut up.  We're trying to get the girl on the phone.  That was part of this whole thing at the Nutcracker Suite.  So we'll see what happens.  She's not going to come on.  Hey, why don't we take a break?  Now the phones are, see?  Yeah, there they come.  They didn't know they could call about this.  All right, well, we'll talk to them next on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:26:00]  We've got Nick DiPaolo.  He's playing Brigada this weekend.  One show, Nick?  What do you got?  A couple shows?  Yeah, one show.  One biggie?  Yeah, one Saturday night.  Saturday night.  Are you doing the music box?  I don't know.  It's a great room.  It's with Artie Lang.  I'm sure it's the big room.  If you're doing it with Artie, you're probably doing the event center, which is, if they're not  sold out, they will be, because that bastard sells a lot of tickets.  And can you go to nickdip.com if you want to hear my radio show?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Nickdip.com.  And I'll be in San Francisco Friday, Saturday, Sunday for the holiday weekend at Cobb's Comedy. 
[01:26:30]  Very, very nice.  Hey, it's Black History Month, and we're doing a little something with the Black History Month.  We have another honoree today.  Yeah, we're honoring people that aren't usually in the limelight during Black History Month.  We always hear about Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, the peanut guy.  But this is always about the peanut guy.  Growing up, especially, I think they've done a little more in history.  There's a lot more in history in schools now than when I was growing up.  But me, it was only the peanut guy.  Yeah, Carver, whatever.  They were so proud of George Washington Carver and his peanuts. 
[01:27:00]  You know what the blacks don't like Jews?  The Jews get E equals MC squared and electricity.  But you guys, we would have jelly with nothing on it if it weren't for you.  Thanks.  Hey, I got to squeeze this in.  Big A and Sam are going to the NBC Knight Rider.  What, premiere at the Playboy Mansion tonight?  Those lucky bastards?  Someone had to write that?  Those lucky bastards?  For a recap of their mansion experience, tune in to the show this show, Friday morning. 
[01:27:30]  Don't miss the Knight Rider movie event, Sunday, February 17th on NBC.  Big A at the Playboy Mansion.  We'll see what happens.  I can't even fathom what's going to happen.  I hope they find him dead in the grotto, just floating.  With just hair, with blood in the follicles in his hand.  And one of F's girls missing.  Just some girl sobbing with a piece of her scalp torn out. 
[01:28:00]  He tried to pet me.  He kept calling for George.  Big A is a ghoul.  I was supposed to be Miss May.  There's a breast missing, and he's just chewing, staring vacantly at the space.  What happened?  Frightened Big A.  Shut up.  Oh, he's the worst.  Is Big A coming in Friday to talk about it?  He's got to be here live.  You've got to get him in studio for this.  All right.  More with Nick DiPaolo. 
[01:28:30]  Black History Month.  Here's today's honoree.  In honor of Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show is honoring black heroes,  African-American individuals throughout history, without whom this country would not be the melting pot it is today.  Today, we honor the late Scatman Crothers, songwriter, composer, actor, comedian, guitarist,  star of stage, screen, television, and, of course, The Shining.  Hello? 
[01:29:00]  Anybody here?  Stay tuned for more icons of black history.  Can I guys be back?  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're back.  Opie and Anthony, Nick DiPaolo, playing the Bregada this weekend with Artie Lang.  We're promoting an Artie Lang date.  Are we insane?  Twice now.  It's so weird. 
[01:29:30]  You know how much they hate us over there?  We don't play that game.  Whatever, man.  I'm sorry.  Jimmy does gigs with Artie Lang.  Nick DiPaolo's doing gigs with Artie Lang.  We're doing a benefit together.  We've never actually done a paid gig together.  We did one benefit for something at the Stress Factory a couple years ago.  We did the Dennis Leary, Cam Neely Foundation thing in Boston, and we're doing the Jerry Red  Wilson benefit.  Oh, that's right.  March 5th here at Town Hall.  It's you, you charitable bastard.  Yeah, but I mean, it's Artie.  It's myself.  It's, I think, Louis C.K. 
[01:30:00]  You on that?  Yeah, I'm doing it.  Oh, Nick's on it.  Okay.  So it's basically just a vomit-inducing, caustic show.  Assiduous.  A very assiduous show.  I went one year.  Ass.  It's great.  Yeah, it's always a great show.  It was a great lineup, and everyone just killed stuff.  And I've got to say right now, if this quote is accurate, Jimmy, I was quoted in Sports  Illustrated.  They asked for a quote about the Daytona 500, and I wrote basically that I had no idea  about it, and I, you know, and if this is the quote they attributed to me, I'm going  to find who did this, and I'm going to set their office on fire at that minute. 
[01:30:30]  I'm going to burn them alive.  This is the quote they attributed to me.  That sounds illegal, Jimmy.  Oh, I don't know.  You could get in a bit of a...  Oh, Nick, I kid because I love.  You could get in Dutch.  Whenever I pick on someone in the audience, I say, I kid because I love, and I wave at  him.  I'm like, oh, for sure.  He gets it.  What publication is this in?  It's on sportsillustrated.com.  Ah, that's not a biggie.  Do you know?  There's probably 5,000 people a month that go to perhaps more than that, Jim.  And I like the picture they used of me.  It makes me look like a real player.  I'm standing there in an ill-fitting suit with Jessica Drake, so it kind of looks like 
[01:31:00]  I have a hot chick with me.  But it says, this is the quote.  No, I don't think anyone confused that, actually.  I'm sure they didn't.  Jimmy Johnson.  I had said something about how I don't know.  I kind of picked Jimmy Johnson because he's the only name I recognize, and we've interviewed  him, and he's nice.  Great guy.  Yeah.  And I made a joke about how I didn't know.  You know, I tied him with the football coach.  Me, I didn't know who he was.  I didn't say it was an award winner.  I didn't say it was Woody Allen's moose bit.  But, it wasn't what they gave me.  This is the quote. 
[01:31:30]  Jimmy Johnson, because nice guys can finish first.  Oh, for Christ's sake.  Can I say that?  You understand.  Okay, terrific.  I wouldn't have given that quote if it was just him and Hitler racing together.  Because nice guys can finish first.  Muggy face.  Wow.  What a good comedian this guy is.  Because there's that saying, nice guys finish last. 
[01:32:00]  But you kind of twisted it around.  If they edited my quote like that, did you say anything like that?  Yeah.  No.  I said, and I can't remember exactly.  It was something along the line.  Again, sports.  I mean, something about the other thing.  The only name I know is Jimmy Johnson.  We've interviewed him.  He's a nice guy.  Okay, there's the nice guy part.  But that wasn't the joke, and they knew it.  He finished his races.  Finished.  Yeah.  They just took a bunch of clips of it and pieced it together.  Make you sound like a douche. 
[01:32:30]  A total...  Hang in there, Jimmy.  By the way, Jimmy Johnson doesn't call our show anymore ever since he started winning like crazy.  We used to have the guy on all the time.  He's terrific.  I don't care about that stupid race.  Big deal.  It's a circle.  We get it.  You're arriving.  All right, we got Patrick from New York.  Getting back to that S&M thing.  What's up, Patrick?  Hey, it'll be Anthony.  I've been listening for a long time.  Quack, quack.  Thanks.  We've got an interesting story here for you. 
[01:33:00]  All right, take your time.  Don't rush.  Yeah, just...  Oh, wow.  Letting it build.  Do you understand you're a bad caller?  Yes, I understand.  Yeah, okay.  As long as you know.  He's hanging from his nipples as he calls you.  You would be better as...  He's on high heels.  You would be better as just a listener to this show.  Yeah, maybe you're not up to a caller yet.  Yeah, there's people that make it up to caller status.  You got to advance.  And then some of those people make it to be in-studio people. 
[01:33:30]  You have to level up.  Yeah.  It's like a video game.  All right, let's go.  Save your phone call.  Let's go, Patrick.  Come on.  I've got a friend of mine here.  She claims to be this great dominatrix.  Okay?  So far, she's had two very interesting clients that I've heard of.  One, the guy wanted her to stick her arm up his ass as far as...  Yeah, well...  Yeah, right.  See, again, let me just point out how bad of a caller you are, sir.  You do realize that we're on the radio? 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  And the thing you just said, you do realize that it is against FCC rules to describe something  like that in such graphic detail, don't you?  I thought it was along the lines of vulgarities as in, like, curses and stuff.  Oh, my God.  Do you think, if it was just curses, that we couldn't work our way around and talk about  anything with arms and places on people's bodies and things like that in just graphic 
[01:34:30]  detail?  Do you understand?  You don't understand, do you?  You're frustrating.  I want to take my fist and I want to...  Yeah.  Jam it down your throat.  Right.  So he wanted the dominatrix basically to do this.  He wanted to kind of hang out and he wanted her to pretend that she was birthing a cow.  Well put, Jimmy.  Make him a living stock puppet.  Okay.  Living stock puppet.  How about you don't add in stuff after we say something because I don't trust you to  do it properly. 
[01:35:00]  That's right.  We don't need you to punctuate.  We take care of everything.  I apologize.  Okay.  Now, let's see.  With what you've learned, you said there were a couple of things, right?  Yes.  Okay.  Give us one more thing.  Now, with what you've learned, let's see if you can do this properly.  Go ahead.  You're on.  Okay.  The second one is that she had a, well, a gentleman of the Jewish persuasion.  A Jewish guy.  You can say that.  He golfed up when he doesn't have to. 
[01:35:30]  A non-female specimen guy.  He was driving, I guess, an automobile.  She had an accountant.  Okay.  Go ahead.  She had him, well, he had her dress up as a stormtrooper, a la World War II, and beat the  ever-living crap out of him.  I just thought it was fine.  Oh, okay.  So, a Jewish guy would have somebody dressed like a Nazi and then beat him up. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I don't know if branding was involved, but I hear tales.  Thank you, Patrick.  Again, let me tell you something.  You probably the worst caller of, I'll give him.  The decade.  The year.  No, no.  I'll give him the year because it's early in the year.  But, sir, you are in the running for worst caller of the year.  Thanks.  Okay. 
[01:36:30]  An ass.  You're a boob.  All right.  Thank you, Patrick.  Patrick's trying.  Thank you, buddy.  He's all red and hot right now as he hangs the phone up.  I've made an ass on myself.  Scalp is tingling.  That guy can spin a yarn, can't he?  He really was.  40-minute pause and then right into something we dump out of.  Good news, by the way.  We found someone that is actually endorsing Hillary Clinton, finally.  Oh, good.  Big celeb.  Who's endorsing Obama at this point?  Everybody.  Everybody.  A lot of people, right?  All the actors and all the guilty white people and all the black people. 
[01:37:00]  Now Hispanics have just jumped on board.  Yeah, really?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, it's over, Johnny.  It's over.  He's going to be the Democratic nominee.  Well, he's got a ton of experience.  I can see why everyone's swarming to him.  Jesus.  Yeah, it's not a cult of personality thing.  And again, it's not a racial.  Seriously, smart guy and stuff, but really.  It's not racial, no.  Can we cut the crapola?  Seriously.  Seriously.  What's his foreign policy?  He played Risk in high school twice.  Dink. 
[01:37:30]  I'm voting for him because I want a black guy to give me change, finally.  I'm going to use that last time I was here.  I'm not sure, but I love that joke.  I think you used it at a different time, so it works.  Trust me.  New audience right now.  They're hearing it for the first time.  We're not, but they are.  So, who do you think's endorsing Hillary?  This is way out there.  A celebrity?  Obviously.  You want to play three questions?  Okay, celebrity.  And they're of the Latin persuasion?  Nope.  Ooh.  Television or movies? 
[01:38:00]  Neither.  Neither, for the most part.  A celebrity going for the black eye over the woman.  Must be a stand-up comic.  I mean, a little movie, but...  Little movie.  Barely.  Oh, boy.  Don't pay attention to movie.  Or TV.  Okay.  Oh, no.  Yet a celebrity.  Yet a celebrity.  Radio?  Some type of astronaut.  Buzz Aldrin.  Michael Collins.  I'll give you this one.  Look at the dark side, and it just affected them while they were on the moon. 
[01:38:30]  I'll give you this one.  Huge black celebrity.  Oh.  Huge black celebrity.  The guy from the Green Mile?  I didn't understand your context of the word.  Colin Ferguson.  Not big enough.  All right.  Not big enough.  Falma TV.  Blag.  Singer.  50 Cent.  Jimmy.  Are you cheating?  No.  Is that right?  Because he already endorsed Hillary.  On the nose.  Like, in his truck.  And maybe we're a day behind.  Huh? 
[01:39:00]  No, last week he did.  Are you saying he's endorsing Hillary or Obama?  Was it last week?  Oh, who are we talking about?  Obama or Hillary?  No, Hillary.  Oh, he is endorsing Hillary.  50 Cent is endorsing Hillary Clinton.  Why?  I don't think this was last week, was it?  Yeah, they showed him in his truck.  Wow.  Well, let's find out.  I'll tell you why.  Let me tell you why before you even play it.  And that's what he said.  Let me tell you why before you even play it.  Okay.  Because he feels if a black guy becomes president, he can't do that whole against the man, downtrodden 
[01:39:30]  thing because the black guy's the president, for God's sake.  Oh, yeah.  Every bit of I can't do this because I'm a black man in a white society gets thrown out  the window the second he takes the oath to office.  Well, that, Anthony, that and like real street guys like 50 Cent, you know, they don't want  white people having a hand in making this guy huge.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  True.  Yeah.  The real street, street, you know, fellas.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Let's find out why.  50.  Why Hillary?  I just think she could do a good job. 
[01:40:00]  Really?  Yeah.  I mean, Obama, there ain't nothing bad about Obama in my eyes either, but I just think  Hillary would, that would be my choice.  Well, Mr. Cent, thank you for the ride.  I'm not sure America is ready to have a black president.  Really?  I think they might kill him.  Yeah.  Jesus.  They might kill him.  That's why he won in Iowa by 20 points.  Jesus.  In Iowa.  Can we let go of that?  Iowa?  Why?  He just won Maine.  Yeah, exactly.  Maine.  He crushed in Maine. 
[01:40:30]  So you can see how racist a country this is.  I've been to Maine a few times.  Yeah, I went to school up there.  Wow.  They're making their own cheese and they go canoeing.  Didn't he win Nebraska?  He won Nebraska too, right?  Nebraska, Iowa, Maine.  And Washington State.  I said this yesterday on my little crappy show, but they just, people on the left, they  want this country to be racist so bad.  Oh, yeah.  They just can't.  It gives them a purpose.  Oh, Jesus H. Christ.  Yeah, the guy won Maine.  I mean.  He won Maine.  He won Maine. 
[01:41:00]  L.L. Bean's in Maine for Christ's sake.  There's something going on out there.  It's time to acknowledge that.  It's come to a head.  All this political correctness.  Seriously.  Yeah.  Yeah.  25 years of white, you're pounding young kids.  Mm-hmm.  It's finally come to a head.  Yeah.  That's all it is.  It's that simple.  It's exactly what it is.  They finally got, and good.  Good for them.  We'll see how it works out.  See how it pans out.  That's all.  Yeah.  Let them play.  It's exciting.  See how it works.  All exciting is a word for it. 
[01:41:30]  I'd vote for him before Hillary.  I gotta be honest.  Hillary, as a comic, she would be entertaining.  Yeah.  She's very entertaining.  Oh, yeah.  It's like a heavy bag.  Yeah.  I don't want to have a lot of cankles.  Yes.  Except less sexy than a heavy bag.  Nick, you think the wheels are starting to wobble on McCain?  He's getting, he's not looking the same, man.  He's on TV almost every night, and he's starting to look a little, uh, a little.  You gotta take a lot out of him, man.  First of all, yeah, it's, uh, boy.  I'm just seeing the, the wheels are just starting to wobble a little bit. 
[01:42:00]  He's gonna ruin it for himself.  He's gonna do something stupid in the next couple of months.  Here's the thing, though.  It's gonna be the last piece of the puzzle to make Obama president.  If it is, but if it is Barack versus McCain, if you can't, I mean, Barack is, literally  came out for giving illegals driver's license.  I know.  He's gonna raise taxes.  If you can't beat that man on the right.  Yeah.  I mean, we haven't, they haven't got to his specific issue.  You know what I mean?  He's been, he's been getting, like, a little bit of a free ride here.  When it comes one-on-one, they have to debate, and he has to come right out and say, yeah, 
[01:42:30]  it's a good idea to give illegals, you know.  Yeah, driver's license, and just let them all across the border.  And, uh, raising taxes, and, and, I mean, I don't see.  Raise those taxes for his health care thing that's gonna be implemented, he said, not in  10 years, and not in 20 years, but during, uh, my first term as president.  Yeah.  He's already planning on two.  And nobody's talking about, you know.  Yeah.  How?  Nobody's, yeah, it's change, change, change.  We're not getting the specifics.  Yeah.  When they shine the light on him, I gotta believe.  Yeah.  Even McCain, but yeah, I mean. 
[01:43:00]  McCain.  How old is he?  McCain makes me nervous though, though.  You just see.  Not as old.  His eyes aren't completely focused.  Oh, he's a crazy bastard.  He's just slightly off.  He's slightly off, man.  It's all right, though.  I got a little.  Oh, he's a little lunatic.  He was trying, he was giving that speech in front of the, see, packed ad, and he was trying  to tell the crowd, he's gonna hit the button with his elbow.  Yeah, his arms don't work well after they've been snapped by Vietnamese rifle butts.  Obama's gonna pay for all this stuff by collecting our change. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, exactly.  A big change.  Change for change.  Yeah, change for change.  There you go.  That's good.  The advantage he has, though, is even though he hasn't been around for too long, that's  probably gonna be an advantage because there's not a whole lot of years of stuff to attack.  He's seen as this fresh face.  Like, yeah, he voted this way and that way, but there's not a whole history of the attack.  Well, that's a good point, Jimmy.  You gotta weigh his liberal stances on issues with, you know, there is a mentality, hey,  let's kick the bums out and get a fresh start.  You know, you gotta weigh whatever's stronger.  So you might be right.  I mean, if people are really, you know, after eight years of Republicans, we want to, you 
[01:44:00]  know, clean house or whatever.  I like that.  Black guy is the way to do it.  I like he's not, I like that he's not, that's one extreme to the other.  I like that he's not bitter and he truly, and he truly believes that he can maybe make  a difference.  A lot of these older politicians, they're like, you know what, I already know.  How naive.  Right.  Well, yeah.  I kind of like the fact that he really believes that he might be able to do something.  Yeah.  Wait till his 10th day in office.  Right.  When King Jum Il or whatever that crazy.  Yeah. 
[01:44:30]  Korean maniac.  We're supposed to talk to our enemies and stuff.  Yeah.  Good luck.  Yeah.  He'll be dropping bombs.  He'll be throwing things.  Because Clinton was a lot like that.  And it took a couple of things for him to start lobbing cruise missiles into the Balkans  and wherever the hell else he could.  Yeah.  Anywhere but where the people we needed to kill were.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He bombed like Bin Laden's summer hideaway five years after he left.  Sure.  Shot stupid.  Blew up a toothpaste factory in Kosovo.  In Kosovo.  Oh, no.  The fluoride's going through.  But you've got to admit, it's interesting. 
[01:45:00]  I'm like every day I get up.  Oh, it is.  This is one election that has really got everybody interested.  Even if you're not into elections.  Sure.  And a lot of people aren't.  This one's kind of got you like, wow, you've got a woman in here, a black guy, a friggin' old nut.  A crazy P.O.W.  A crazy old P.O.W.  Sure.  He's just a crazy look in his eye.  It's really.  And then you've got Huckabee.  He won't give up.  This guy.  I was watching.  He ain't stopping.  He's not stopping.  What's his.  What is his. 
[01:45:30]  What is he saying now?  That he still has a shot.  What is he saying?  Yeah.  He can still pull it out.  He didn't know he's down.  2,000 delegates is six.  Yeah, they were on TV going, look, it is mathematically impossible.  And they're like, but what about if you put, you know, super delegates and this and that?  What if Mitch Romney gives his delegates back?  It's still mathematically impossible, they were saying on the news last night.  Well, he's smart, though.  I mean, just to stay in the game, you know, and he's.  I think he knows a little something about McCain.  I think he's hoping McCain is going to do something dumb and trips up. 
[01:46:00]  Well, yeah, him and McCain did a little two-timing on Romney in West Virginia.  So there's something going on there.  And McCain already said that he only wants to be president for one term, you know, because he's old.  He already came out and said that.  And Huckabee, you know, if he got picked as his vice, I don't think he's done it, but if he did.  He'd be the incumbent running.  He'd have one foot in the door, you know.  And he's a real slick.  Everybody thought he was like a hillbilly, but this guy is great when he speaks.  Yeah.  But he plays bass.  You've got to play league at the hour. 
[01:46:30]  All right, another quiz.  I didn't know McCain said that, by the way.  They only wanted one term.  Yeah, he's already.  Yeah, I didn't know that either.  Yeah.  So it's like, what are we going to invest time in him for?  Then we've got to go through this again in a few years?  If he's doing a great job, we can't keep him?  Well, it depends who his running mate is.  He should take Romney, actually.  He should, but I don't think Romney would agree to that.  All right, another quiz.  Whites will be the minority in the U.S. by what year?  2050.  2050.  2005.  We already are. 
[01:47:00]  2050.  Yeah, Nick reads the newspaper.  But they figure that.  I count black people on the street.  They figure that as all the minorities versus the whites.  Yeah.  So it's like everything.  Right.  You know, it's not like it's going to be.  You think just Latino, right?  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  Well, they say the Hispanic population will, what, five times over or ten times more than  it is now?  Yeah, by next week at this time.  Next week. 
[01:47:30]  And next, exactly a week from Tuesday, they all take off.  People are serious.  But like L.A., you know, people, L.A., it's already.  It's amazing when you go.  White majority minority.  When you go to Southern California, L.A., or even further south like that, Laguna Beach,  places, it's just, it's Mexico.  Yeah.  It's North Mexico.  With good water.  Yeah.  It really is time to just shut the border.  I mean, listen to this in the story.  More than 80% of the increase will be due to immigrants arriving in the country and 
[01:48:00]  their U.S.-born children, who will make up nearly one in five Americans by 2050.  Oh, yeah.  Read Pat Buchanan's books.  Amazing.  You want those numbers?  Oh, that is amazing.  Oh, we got Sean Hannity calling in in a few minutes.  Awesome.  There we go.  We should take a break and set that up nice.  Nice.  Want to win $2,000?  Oh, this is cool.  Yeah, we were talking about this a couple weeks ago, behind the scenes.  We're finally doing this.  You got a chance to win $2,000.  Send us an original animated bit from our show. 
[01:48:30]  Ooh.  Yeah, we're opening up the animation thing to more talented people out there.  So what do you take?  A clip from our show and take the sound and then animate it.  Coke Logic is the star of this, but we're giving others a chance.  You go to onaradio.com for all the details.  O-N-A-Radio.com for all the details.  Courtesy of Be Kind Rewind.  You name it, we shoot it in theaters February 22nd.  What's that movie about?  Be Kind Rewind?  Yeah.  Guy goes to the video store. 
[01:49:00]  The whole thing.  Hijinks ensued.  Gets yelled at.  Yeah, the guy's like, no, but I did.  Somebody else watched it.  I thought my wife put it back.  It's crazy.  It was a problem with the slot.  Couldn't even watch it.  The tracking was off.  Yeah, yeah.  The whole thing is nuts.  Tracking.  Oh, my God.  I forgot about tracking.  Remember the stupid tracking?  How annoying was that?  Oh, my God.  It's like, oh, look at that.  The top half of the picture's gone.  It's the tracking.  Turn the tracking.  I forgot about that.  Another reason why our ancestors sucked.  They couldn't even figure that out. 
[01:49:30]  I know that's not that long ago, but still.  We should have skipped right over VHS.  Oh, yeah.  It should have gone right to some kind of DVD.  It does seem that way.  It's all like recording.  Yeah.  It does seem that way.  It's like, oh, it works on a cassette tape.  Let's just make one 100 times bigger.  Yeah, but.  And you're shoving in this big machine.  We had to get past the beta war.  You understand.  Oh, that's right.  The beta.  It was a big beta war.  That's stupid tape.  That slowed down everything.  It's like power locks in your car.  Why was that so long and coming?  Yeah.  Right. 
[01:50:00]  Power seats.  Everything else was power in there.  Remember when you're watching a movie, and then you'd hear like.  And then the picture would go out, and that horror when you hit the eject button.  And just have tape come flying at it.  What do I do?  Oh, my.  And then there was that spot every time.  You knew when it was coming.  When you watched it again.  It's like, oh, here's where it crinkled last time.  Yeah.  The porno.  You never get to see the end.  She had tapioca on her face.  Who was responsible? 
[01:50:30]  Oh, videotape.  Tommy in Brooklyn.  We do have to take a break.  We've got Sean Heddy standing by.  What's up, Tommy?  Tommy.  Yeah, you know, McCain, what scares me is his smile.  As soon as he gets stumped or he gets upset, he has a crazy smile.  Like he's going to put a knife into your chest.  I kind of like that about him, don't you?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's a nice picture of him right there.  Yeah, look at that.  There you go.  That's the picture of him getting a beating. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  Mao!  Mao!  That's a flashback.  Yeah.  We'll flashback face.  We'll get that picture up on onaradio.com.  They say he's got a violent temper.  Usually they say he's got a bad temper.  Yeah.  They actually use...  Violent.  Can you blame him?  Shoulders being held together by, you know, rat skins and nails.  We learned more about him yesterday.  He was pummeled.  When they ditched that guy.  Unbelievable.  Oh, is that right?  I didn't get the...  Before they even got him, he already had, what, two broken arms?  Apparently he was in his plane, he was on a bombing run, and from what... 
[01:51:30]  Who was saying that?  Billy?  Bill Burr, I believe.  Yeah, Bill Burr was saying that he just did one of those Star Wars, stay on target, stay  on target, and didn't deviate even though he knew a missile was coming for him.  So right when he dropped this bomb, the missile hit his wing, so he bails out, breaks both  arms as he ejected.  Yeah.  So he's parachuting down with two broken arms.  He breaks a leg on the way down, lands in a marsh, and then the Vietnamese come over  and just start beating the crap out of him with rifle butts. 
[01:52:00]  The first thing they did was break his shoulder.  Yeah, break his shoulder and...  And that's how it began.  ...and then bayoneted him in the groin.  They were trying to set those bones.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's tough, man.  Wait, he took a bayonet to the groin?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  He should be president.  No, exactly.  I got...  Right there.  Screw about it.  What did Hillary do?  All right, I'm changing.  She's put enough in men.  Verbal bayonet to the husband.  All right, we got a break because Sean Hannity's on a tight schedule today.  It's Opie and Anthony, Nick DiPaolo, Bregata this weekend, Saturday night. 
[01:52:30]  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton is in the bathroom.  And Nick DiPaolo.  And hopefully Sean Hannity.  Is that him right there?  Ooh.  Yeah, it's kind of weird, but we get along with Sean Hannity.  Why is that weird?  It's not weird at all.  I don't know, because, like, people look at us as just being dumb shock jocks.  Well.  And we have a friend like Sean Hannity.  Sean!  Hey, guys, look.  Yeah, but I will say this. 
[01:53:00]  This friendship only goes in one direction.  You know, here you guys are under fire.  I'm out there defending you.  Yep.  And I'm like, guys, come on the TV show.  Come on the TV show.  Uh, listen, uh, I'll call you back in about three months.  Oh.  We had to, like, stay, uh, you know, under the radar for a while there.  Here, I'm out front defending you guys, and I can't even get you guys to help me defend you guys.  You know how this stupid business is.  Yeah.  You're not allowed to talk.  Yeah, it's run by liberals.  Yeah. 
[01:53:30]  You know what's amazing about that?  Huh?  It's like the best thing you can do is go out and defend yourself.  Oh, I know.  Yeah, listen to me.  And they don't want you to.  Sean.  It's like a muzzle on you, and I'm like.  All right, I'll defend, I'll defend ONA.  No, Sean, here's the deal.  We got Nick DiPaolo in studio.  You should get him on your show.  He's, he's really, really up on politics.  No, I've heard Nick.  And then, by the way, he's got a really good sense of humor.  Nick, how you doing?  Good.  How you doing, Sean?  I met your next-door neighbor.  I played Caroline's, uh, a few weeks ago, and this kind of good-looking, attractive woman, 
[01:54:00]  all drunk, comes up to me.  She's, like, trying to kiss me.  She goes, where do you live?  I go, Westchester.  I go, where do you live?  She goes, next to Sean Hannity.  And then, uh, you know, it was her husband's 50th birthday, and she's trying to make out  with me.  You know who I'm talking about?  She was a real hot ticket.  I have no idea.  Sean, I don't know what you're talking about.  She must have had dough.  She's living next to you.  I have no idea.  Well, uh, I want to go see a Caroline's.  Yeah.  Hey, Sean, a couple things, uh, because I know you don't have a lot of time.  Uh, I watched your show last night.  I try to watch it a few times a week. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  And, uh, you did a great job at the David Schuster thing.  Thank you.  Uh, you, you, you stuck up for the guy.  And there you got Keith Overman on, not sticking up for his own guy.  Yeah, well, it's even worse than that.  Keith Overman actually had used the phrase back in September.  Yep.  Yeah.  Uh, when he talked about pimping to describe General Petraeus.  Sean, you're not talking to the old Opie and Anthony.  We know we did 20 minutes on that yesterday.  Ouch.  Ouch.  You know, we're good at Googling, too.  Well, you know, um, listen, at least this isn't the XM version, by the way, which I've 
[01:55:00]  heard, which, uh, would take, which would shock Hillary.  If that comment shocked Hillary, I just think 20 minutes of O and A on XM would be shocked.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The, the, the whole, uh, taking the pimping line literally, uh, instead of figuratively,  which it, it's just become part of, uh, pop culture.  It's part of, uh, it's an expression now.  It's not to be taken literally.  And the fact that she did come out, um, and she's stumping for her mother, uh, she's never 
[01:55:30]  done this before.  Uh, Hillary does seem to be trailing.  And, um, the, he was completely justified in saying what he did say.  I, I have a little bit different take.  And my take is, I don't think he should be fired.  I think Hillary is, you know, I brought up the example, uh, because she's saying, well,  I'm a mother first and I'm a mother first.  And I'm listening to that and I'm thinking, yeah.  And Monica Lewinsky had a mom and a dad also. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  And Paula Jones had a mom and a dad also.  So, you know, let's stop with the theatrics in that sense.  But I, I found it offensive in as much as, you know what, it's hard enough for these  kids to have their parents out there in the public eye.  We want good people to run for office.  We discourage them in every way imaginable because all we do is drag up every dumb thing  they've said and every idiotic thing they've done in their lives.  So I don't think it's good for the process to be attacking the kids of candidates, but  I do see some hypocrisy on their part.  I, I say, leave the kids alone, go after the parents and, uh, and let, they're the ones 
[01:56:30]  putting themselves in the arena.  I didn't really see it as going after her as much as it was going after the parents  to tell you the truth.  And, uh, and she's out there.  She's an adult now.  She, she's in the public eye, uh, stumping for her mother, trying to, uh, get these super  delegates and you know something it, it makes it fair game.  And I think people have been nothing but nice to her, which they should be. 
[01:57:00]  You know, she seems like a good enough kid and everything, but, um, it's not a kid  though, she's like 25, 27, 27.  Okay.  Yeah.  You know what the difference is though, Anthony, I would say if she was out there attacking  Barack Obama, in other words, if she was really in the midst of a campaign, you know, private  conversations to super delegates to try and persuade them to support your mom, it's a  lot different than going out there on the campaign stuff and, and literally throwing  yourself into the heart and soul of a campaign.  That would seem more like pimping out or.  Well, it would seem more like she would make herself open as a target and, and I think 
[01:57:30]  just make it a few calls on, on behalf of her mother.  She does seem like a good kid.  I, you know, like, for example, I got to know Romney's kids.  They're good kids.  The Bush daughters, they've been attacked over the years.  And I, I would just have a general rule, leave the kids alone of candidates or else you'll  never get any good candidates.  I get the feeling you don't use the word pimp in, uh, Sean.  I don't, I don't get it.  I can't, I have trouble picturing Bill Clinton as a pimp and not a John.  That's where I, sorry, you're breaking up on me. 
[01:58:00]  He has a way of, uh, keeping himself, uh, keeping distance between what we're saying  on the radio.  What is this thing that, it's amazing in the last 10 years, all we like to do is catch  each other, uh, in verbal missteps.  Is this Norton?  Yes.  Hey, buddy.  Hi, Sean.  And, uh, we like to catch each other in verbal missteps and then attack the person, uh, until  they're completely ruined.  We've just become like a real, a nation of just sniveling little hens.  We really are turning into a bunch of women.  Listen, I'm going to tell you something.  And you guys are really front and center in all of this. 
[01:58:30]  And, and we watched this whole thing unfold with IMAS.  And, and, uh, I think, you know, there, there are literally orchestrated efforts and, and  I'm the least controversial of all of you guys, but it's only, the only reason they  want to shut somebody like me down is because they don't like my political point of view.  Yeah.  And my attitude is, is everybody has choices and options in life.  You know, let's stop with the, you know, secret PC police monitoring talk shows and  trying to find one word, one sentence, one phrase, one paragraph that often is taken out 
[01:59:00]  of context and, and trying to use it as a lever to attack advertisers and attack, you  know, weak management and get people off the radio.  Sean, can I ask you a question, Sean?  Nick, doesn't most of that type of censorship, that PC censorship come from the left?  Yes.  It's all, look, look at who's out there defending free speech today.  Thank you.  It's conservatives like me and Opie.  Well, you know what?  The guys that forgave IMAS were, were, uh, John McCain and Rudy Giuliani were the two 
[01:59:30]  that came out and go, look, the guy said he was sorry.  It's done.  You, uh, were defending, uh, this guy last night while that's, that, that dirtbag  Oberman is throwing him under the bus on his own network.  Yeah.  And by the way, just the week prior, Schuster was firing at me.  It wasn't personal.  Sure.  Now, Sean, we're all in agreement.  So what can we do to fight back?  Because we keep talking about this on our show saying, you know, when is the pushback  going to start happening?  You know, you don't want pushback.  I think pushback's got to start at the management level. 
[02:00:00]  No kidding around.  Yeah.  Opie just fell off his chair laughing at that one.  He's been in this business a little too long.  You mean you'll want them to take a chance, Sean?  Listen, I actually thought there was a time that you guys were going to be thrown overboard  again.  Yeah?  Well, yeah.  So did we.  So did we.  They were desperate, Sean.  They had no, uh.  Look, you guys know what you do.  Your show, because I listen when I'm in the car. 
[02:00:30]  I don't usually listen in the morning.  I listen when they play the repeat later.  And you guys push the envelope as far as anybody can push it.  But if anyone tunes into O&A, they know what they're going to get.  Right.  They know what the show is about.  That's right.  It's nonsense.  It's, well, it's, but you know what?  It's done with a sense of humor.  There's no mean spiritedness.  You guys, all you want to do is cut up, tell a lot of jokes, be irreverent, outrageous.  And a lot of people obviously like it because you do so well.  So why would we take those choices away from people that want to hear you guys on the radio? 
[02:01:00]  To protect.  Because some people feel that they're better suited to tell us what we should be listening to and watching.  To protect us.  Don't listen.  Wow.  I wish it was that easy.  I don't need to be coddled by some liberal.  By the way, Anthony, you know what?  He's matured, Opie, in his political views.  You know, when are we going to bring you on board?  No way.  No way.  Obama!  Oh, Jesus.  He's got the Obama battle cry.  Well, I don't know what's going to happen.  I see a very big cult of personality thing going on with Obama, and I think Nick had 
[02:01:30]  a great point earlier about when this does become one-on-one, if he is indeed the pick  for the Democrats there, he's going to have to answer some hard questions about how he's  going to accomplish some of these promises he's making.  And I don't think a lot of people are going to like the answers.  You know, we did a focus group on Hannity and Combs last night.  We had Frank Luntz out in the field for us.  And so everybody raises their hand.  Do you like Barack Obama?  Everybody loves him.  And then I said to Frank, I said, Frank, ask the focus group to name one specific accomplishment. 
[02:02:00]  They can't answer the question.  Right.  Right.  All they know is that they like him and that, you know, he's more likable than Hillary Clinton.  This is American idol politics.  It's just, we see him, we like the sound bites, the quick clips, and oh, I love this guy.  Why?  And no one's been able to answer.  We sent people out on the streets to ask who they were voting for, and a lot of people 
[02:02:30]  had no clue why they wanted to vote for Obama, but that they were voting for him.  And across racial lines, it was just amazing.  It really is.  People don't want to make a race issue out of this, but when you look at the fact that  over 85% of black people are voting for Obama, that's a little much for it not to be on racial  lines.  Let me, Sean, let me ask you in fairness, though, because I, when Bush was just a governor and  he was running for office, I mean, could people, I mean, maybe some really well-versed people,  but could the average person have named something that George Bush, George W. had done in Texas 
[02:03:00]  other than just be the governor?  Good or bad, you could name the fact that the death penalty and the drop in crime, you  know, he was known for really lining them up and pushing them through.  Well, I think that he had a reputation, he had specific legislative accomplishments, you  know, as governor, as Anthony was pointing out there.  But I'll tell you what's fascinating, if you go back to Super Tuesday, Hillary Clinton 
[02:03:30]  loses 13 states to 8 states. If you add the 4 states that Obama wins this weekend, he's  winning 17 to 8. You've got the Potomac primary today, Virginia, Maryland, and D.C. You realize  in the last 28 contests, if things go as I predict today, Barack Obama has won 20 states, Hillary  has won 8 states, Barack Obama's filling arenas, he's raising 31-plus million every month on the  internet for his campaign. Amazing. It is really a phenomenon that has taken off. 
[02:04:00]  He's like Ross Perot in the sense that he represents just a disgust with what's been  happening. That's why Ross Perot did so well. It just wasn't the status quo, and that's  why people...  But he didn't have the charisma and this cult of personality that Barack seems to have,  especially with the youth.  Well, that...  In politics, you know what, it may sound as basic as this, but likability means a lot.  There's really not a dime's worth of difference in terms of the positions that Hillary and  Barack are taking, except that Barack is just a much more likable human being. 
[02:04:30]  Sean, you're in a weird place, too, because you're not a big fan of McCain, huh?  Well, it's... Do you see the cover of Newsweek?  Well, I was going to bring that up. We've got to promote the fact that Sean Hannity's on  the cover of Newsweek.  Are you really?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's in it a lot.  They're desperate, but...  No, but Sean, don't you think when it gets down to, let's say, McCain, let's say Barack  does win the nomination, once they start shining the light on, like, Barack's views on giving 
[02:05:00]  illegals licenses and raising taxes and all, it should be a slam dunk for McCain, no?  Yeah, I think in the end they're going to coalesce around them, conservatives in the end,  but, you know, the problem is, is that on a lot of issues, I'm not, for example, for  many years in New York I've been a registered conservative, and I only changed to be a Republican  once because I wanted to vote in a primary, but I consider myself a movement conservative  politically, you know, in the, you know, model of Reagan, and on a lot of key issues to  conservatives, John McCain has this habit of reaching across the aisle to people that 
[02:05:30]  we just vehemently disagree with, like Feingold and Kennedy, and, you know, poking his finger  in our eye and abandoning some of those principles, what conservatives are saying is they want  specific promises on issues, and that if you're going to reach across the aisle, reach across  to your base, because without your base you can't win the election.  But they're not going to vote for Obama over him, regardless of what he does.  I don't care what Ann Coulter says.  If he doesn't do a good job of reaching out, and he made a good first step last week when 
[02:06:00]  he went to the CPAC convention, I think he definitely, he has an opportunity here, and  I think they're making every effort to close that gap.  They don't want conservatives hammering on him every day between now and November, because  they know that'll just split the coalition.  Yeah.  McCain, who do you think he's going to want for his vice president?  It's too early to tell.  A lot of talk about the governor of Minnesota has been coming up lately.  If you look at that corridor up there, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, barely blue states, and 
[02:06:30]  an opportunity for Republicans to pick off some of those blue states.  There's a lot of talk that he may want to reinforce his base in the South.  So you look at people like Haley Barber, people have talked about Huckabee or Governor  Crist.  Too early to call.  It all depends.  He's got a long time before he has to make that decision.  And what about Obama?  If he gets the nomination, yeah.  He won't pick Hillary, but she'll pick him.  Really?  Yeah.  He would pick him, and she'd be foolish not to at this point.  Dream ticket. 
[02:07:00]  I'm thinking Obama picks old white guy.  You know, I don't know.  Yeah, McCain.  Just old white guy.  Clinton's first choice originally was a guy like Evan Bayh from Indiana, or somebody like  the governor, a very popular Democratic governor in Ohio, trying to pick off one of the red  states, assuming that she would win the other blue states that John Kerry won.  Right.  Well, would he go with somebody, I think, a little bit more conservative?  I mean, is he going to look at people, like if you have a black president and a female  vice president, that's a very tough thing to sell people, again, just because of the 
[02:07:30]  way we always vote.  So would they possibly go with a more conservative Democrat?  That's possible.  I think they've got to figure out what red state they can take away from the Republicans,  just like the Republicans are figuring out what blue states they can pick off.  Look, I may be naive.  Steve, I think there's certainly bigotry that remains in America, but I think the numbers  and the percentages are quite small.  I don't think America has a problem with a woman president.  I think they just want, just not Hillary. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  I think America has a problem with an African American president.  I think there's a, in terms of substance, I just think Barack Obama's too liberal and  out of touch with the mainstream of political thought.  Interesting.  So who becomes the next president?  Is it thinking McCain?  I'm thinking Opie is president.  Nice.  I like that.  What?  You know what?  Actually, because...  Opie's a little too conservative.  Yeah, Anthony, Opie's too liberal.  You've got to look at your paycheck every week.  You know what?  Open your paycheck and what do you do? 
[02:08:30]  I remember being...  That's what I was saying.  I've been preaching that for years.  I remember being one of the little people out there.  I've always been one of the little people out there.  Yeah, and I paid my taxes and I took care of myself and did what I do.  What I had to do.  Sean, I have plenty of money.  You have plenty of money.  Anthony, I have plenty of money.  I'm the only little person in this room right now.  I remember how it was, sir.  Opie wakes up in the morning, looks at his paycheck, nearly 50% goes to the government,  and you, like, hit yourself on the head and say, I'm not paying enough. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because I have enough money.  You want this kind of care.  We work until May to pay our taxes.  What, do you want to go to September?  I'm not into this socialist form of government that a lot of these Democrats and liberals want.  Why don't you generous liberals, if you feel so compassionate about wanting to help,  why don't you just donate it and stop empowering the government?  Right.  Don't take mine.  I don't want to give it.  I'm giving enough to keep the country running, which is nice.  But if you want to give a little extra to help out with these social programs, 
[02:09:30]  take it out of your own damn pocket.  Redistribution.  They've had it.  Good for you, Anthony.  Thank you.  Hey, someone wants in on this conversation.  Patrick from Queens.  Sean, why don't they bring up that Obama's a Muslim?  Why is this rumor still out there?  He's not a Muslim.  He's not.  That's right.  I'm getting that right.  Yeah.  How did that start?  Was that some kind of massive email or something?  Yeah, it was that.  At one point during the campaign, it was forwarded by a Hillary campaign operative.  Hillary and Bill have these tactics. 
[02:10:00]  What they do is they have their surrogates go out there.  One time, Bob Kerry said, Barack Hussein Obama, to let everybody know what his middle name was.  You have the husband of the former governor of New Hampshire bringing up the drug use.  Did he sell drugs comments?  And then the Clintons say, boy, now please, guys, never do that again.  But they have their surrogates making these attacks on a pretty regular basis.  It's like when you say something in court that you want the jury to hear, even though the judge says disregard that comment, it has to hurt. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, the bell has been wrong.  You can't have it.  Already, right, yeah.  That's exactly what it is.  Yeah, the Clintons are very good at that.  God, did I just put that well.  I'm very proud of myself.  I'm proud of you, too, Norton.  That's good, buddy.  So, Barack never attended a madrasa.  Did you see Norton when he was on Hannity and Combs?  Yes.  I don't know if they saw it, but it was my one appearance.  I was hoping for more.  Now, we'll bring it back, but what's the first thing I said to you before you go on the air?  Do you remember?  This is not Opie and Anthony?  Like, something probably about my language?  I said, look, say anything you want, but please, you know.  No key stories on the air. 
[02:11:00]  He was listening to you the day before, and I couldn't repeat what you were saying.  But Jimmy's actually, and I'm sure you found this out, Jimmy's actually very good when it comes to that.  No, he handled it like a...  Yeah.  I personally enjoyed my last appearance on Hannity and Combs.  When Combs started talking, I looked at him and went, wow, you actually talk?  Jesus.  It kind of hurt him, I think.  I was just going for a laugh.  He's got a good sense of humor.  He's got to be.  I know Sean enjoyed it.  I have a question.  Has the band been lifted?  Will the management let you guys back on, or what? 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, we're...  Yeah, I guess.  I guess.  I guess we'll go on there.  Yeah, there's no boss here, really.  Yeah, we don't have a boss.  He's got nothing to do.  Do they have mass firings over there?  Yeah.  Maybe I can get back on, huh?  They called it the bloodbath.  It was great.  400 people lost their jobs nationwide.  Congratulations on the cover of Newsweek.  And, you know, Sean's radio show is 3 o'clock Eastern time, and 9 p.m. on Fox.  It's Hannity!  All right, guys, thank you.  And Combs.  Wait, wait, wait, Sean.  Sean, when are we going to get the big invite to the big estate? 
[02:12:00]  Why?  You want to go to his house?  I want to go to Sean's house.  He promised me a barbecue.  Now it's winter.  We already met your neighbors.  Come on.  Yeah, when are we going to get the big invite, Sean?  You know what?  We all should go out.  That's okay.  Go out.  We all should go out.  That's what he said last time.  Why don't we go see Nick and Patrice over at Caroline's?  Oh, see.  Where would we go out together, Sean?  I'd go to Caroline's with you.  Caroline's?  I like the way Sean thinks.  What about a nice restaurant?  Sean wants to go somewhere he doesn't have to talk. 
[02:12:30]  I'll take you to Roos Chris Steakhouse.  Ooh, nice bottle of red and a little steak.  Talk politics.  Sean doesn't want any secrets of his security around the house being breached.  Right.  You know?  Well, the funny thing is I don't want to reveal the secret because you guys, the last time  you were at the studio, I mean, you brought your girlfriends.  By the way, I'm sure they've dumped you by now.  No.  I'm now engaged, Sean.  Are you serious?  Yes.  Yeah, I hope he's engaged.  I'm very happy.  When did you get engaged?  Over the summer.  Well, congratulations.  I hope he's engaged. 
[02:13:00]  Anthony's still with his girl.  And I'm a tranny hunter.  Is this a girl that I met?  Yes.  I think she's way out of your league.  She's way out of my league.  Everyone says that.  Even Sean had to say that.  Thanks, Sean.  No, she was very nice.  Yeah.  But we could, let's still, we'll all go out to dinner.  We'll go to Alan Combs' house.  Yeah, let's.  Let's go to Alan Combs' house.  I live way out on Long Island.  Where do you guys live?  Well, I'm in the city now, but.  I'm in Nassau County.  Yeah, I'm in Suffolk.  How does this show try to weasel into people's personal lives?  Like, hey, Sean, can we sleep over and be sitting in the hot tub for an hour and talk? 
[02:13:30]  I know.  What's the matter with us?  Well, Sean wants to turn me into a Republican, so I'm thinking a nice steak dinner, a bottle of red,  and I'll think about it.  So you will go down to the range, fire off a few rounds.  You must select if you promise to change your vote.  Or maybe, like, fly us around in that private jet of yours I've heard about.  No, I don't have a president.  I've heard stories.  The money this guy must make.  Exactly.  Sean Hanley's got to be pulling in two grand a week if he's making a dollar.  All right, Sean, get lost before you get in trouble. 
[02:14:00]  Good to talk to you all.  All right.  Take care, man.  Thanks, Sean.  Sean gets very nervous every time he calls our show.  I think there's this sense of relief when he hangs up and nothing bad happens.  He's like, oh, jeez, I made it through another show.  I made it through another one.  Oh, I did it again.  I'm not fired.  Can we get a couple quick plugs?  We got Nick DiPaolo.  He's at the Borgata with Artie, what, this Saturday?  Yeah, Saturday night.  And go to nickdip.com and listen to my blog talk radio show.  I'm doing it at 6 o'clock tonight.  I usually do it 2 in the afternoon, Monday through Friday.  Tonight at 6 p.m.  Some fine feedback coming in about your podcast. 
[02:14:30]  Is it a podcast officially?  I don't know what it is.  I have no idea.  I get headphones on.  I'm talking through a phone in my basement.  There's mice running around.  It's a hell of a show.  But, you know, you can cut loose.  Yeah, the people are digging it.  Believe me, I was reading a lot of stuff on the message board.  The chat room, it scares me.  Some of the stuff going on in there.  Yeah.  All right, very cool.  You coming over to the other side over there?  If you're inviting me, I'm coming.  To potty talk land?  Yeah.  I can't wait to get filthy.  Yeah.  Cool.  And if you're on the West Coast and you want your ribs tickled, I'll be appearing this 
[02:15:00]  weekend at Cobb's Comedy Club Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  It's the President's Day weekend show I do every year at Cobb.  In Frisco?  Yeah, Sandy Franny, as I call it.  They won't have me back.  Really?  San Francisco.  I used to do the punchline all the time.  And they get too many letters, the guy said.  I don't doubt it.  Some guy with a tie-dye t-shirt gave me the finger.  Him and his ugly girlfriend with their sandals.  Just carry on.  I do.  Yeah, go home and wash, you filthy hippie.  They won't have me back.  And they give me money. 
[02:15:30]  Last two times, I sold a good bonus money for packing the place.  What is going on with comedy clubs?  They've got to stop.  Yeah, it's San Francisco.  And I love the city.  It's my favorite city to go to, but the politics.  We're hearing from you guys, because you guys go around the country, and then you come  back and report to us.  And they're starting, eh.  The comedy club?  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit.  Yeah.  Let the comedians do their thing.  Leave them alone.  Yeah, I got in a lot of trouble.  All right, we're going over to XM.  Have a great day.  Bye, guys.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:16:00]  The Opie and Anthony Virus.  Get infected.  The Opie and Anthony district have been there.  The Opie is playing in a movie and the other side is playing in in a movie.  Thank you. 
[02:16:30]  Thank you. 
[02:17:00]  Thank you. 
[02:17:30]  Thank you. 
[02:18:00]  Thank you. 
[02:18:30]  Thank you. 
[02:19:00]  Ah, and we're off and running. 
[02:19:30]  Nick DiPaolo has made the walk to XM Satellite Radio.  A lot of people thinking that we all just kissed Sean Hannity's butt.  We like Sean Hannity.  What do we say to him that we don't normally say?  Yeah, what are we supposed to say?  Hardball questions?  What the...  We're friends with the guy, Chris and Philly, what's up?  We were conducting an in-depth interview.  I'll tell you what.  Turn down the fucking music.  Oh, sorry.  Who did he just yell at, Derek? 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  He's been back there 30 seconds.  I know.  That's why I said sorry.  Oh, that's funny.  He's trying to, like, get used to, you know, that seat again.  This is why he didn't want to be back there again.  I know.  I'm sorry.  That's why I quickly said sorry, because I know I'm the problem sometimes, not all the  times.  Chris, what's up?  Yo, guys, what's up?  I'm one of the longest listeners you got, but you've been texting me off the past couple  of days about, you know, not covering Ron Paul, and basically wanted to know why you 
[02:20:30]  didn't ask Sean Hannity why he refuses to talk about him on the air.  I forgot, actually.  He refuses to talk about Ron Paul?  Because he's a non-issue in the election?  Why do you think it is, sir?  Why do you think it is?  Why do I think it is?  It's basically, you know, the media blackout.  He's not getting fair coverage.  And he's still in it, and nobody even knows it.  He's still in it?  But he's not in it.  Well, I have 4% of the, we have over 700 military bases in Saudi Arabia. 
[02:21:00]  You wonder why they want to cut our throat.  And you're asking me if I'm a viable?  I actually like him.  That's funny.  But I actually like, I mean, with each debate, I started to like him more and more.  But again, it's not, his, you know, policy takes aren't too pragmatic.  If we fucking just, you know, bring everybody home, which sounds like a great idea.  I like it.  But I got to believe some of these nuts would fucking take advantage of us.  Yeah, just take everyone home and what happens over there. 
[02:21:30]  But I like guys who stand, you know.  I mean, they have their opinion and their beliefs and they stick by them.  I'm more impressed by that than their actual fucking, you know, policy.  Than the bullshit artists.  I know, Chris, the simple answer, he just didn't get our, I don't know, he didn't get  our attention.  Well, because no one's bringing to your attention.  Basically, just everybody's doing their own homework and figure it out.  The media's not going to tell you the answer.  So, Google Ron Paul and see what he's about, right?  That's what their signs say on the expressway.  Yeah, don't be mad at us. 
[02:22:00]  I mean, he never grabbed our attention, that's all.  We didn't think of it.  What do you think, it was a conspiracy?  We just didn't think of it.  Yeah, I mean.  He could have been the next Paul R. Nelson, but it just didn't happen in this case.  Yeah, why isn't he calling our show?  We put him on.  Yeah, we put Ron Paul on in a second.  Tell that tool to pick up the phone.  Go find him.  I don't have time.  He won't call us.  He's so busy.  All right, boys.  Bye.  All right, thanks, Chris.  God damn good.  Channel Ron.  Yeah, he sounds like a lunatic. 
[02:22:30]  I mean, really, you're looking at, you're all picking on me.  All I do is follow the fucking Constitution.  You money-grubbing cocksuckers have no morals and no value.  You wonder why these Arabs want to cut our fucking throats.  We're building bases right in the fucking NATO front porch.  I assume that's how he sounds.  Yeah.  Pretty cool.  I've never heard of him.  It's a big assumption.  I'm a real nut.  Yeah.  I guess I could figure that one out on my own.  But I like him more than I lean on to, actually. 
[02:23:00]  Hey, we get all the big gets.  We got Amy Ryan calling in in a mere few minutes here from The Wire.  Second season of The Wire.  And she was the star in Gone Baby Gone, a movie I saw yesterday, which was a very good  film.  Where's Roland?  Maybe he could describe Gone Baby Gone, because he sees every film.  That's about Andy Pettit's career?  Is that the movie?  Come on, Nick.  Don't go there.  What do you think about the whole steroids, Roger Clemens thing? 
[02:23:30]  I was ready to say Ron Clemens.  Well, again, you know, and I like that I'm from Boston, and I was a Rocket fan my whole  life, but come on.  Cut the fucking shit, will you?  I mean, first of all, you know, you can look at his numbers just like Barry Barnes.  You look at his number, and they get really good.  Really fast.  Really fast.  Real fast.  He's fucking huge.  Has hamstring problems, which is the first symptom of anybody that juices.  And like Louis CK, I was talking to Louis last night at the comedy show. 
[02:24:00]  Louis goes, he wants us to believe that he turned Andy Pettit on to this trainer, you  know?  The trainer said, yeah, I trained.  I go, but I'm going to give you this H8.  Roger doesn't do this stuff.  Yeah.  I mean, it's, you know what I mean?  What Roger's asking us to believe is a little, a little far-fetched.  Yeah.  I'm hoping I'm wrong, but come on.  Yeah.  This guy's got syringes and shit.  He's like Quincy.  He's skin on him and fucking, he's got stool samples that Clemens left in the toilet in  87.  He's got everything.  This guy really thought ahead, too, just picking all that shit up and packing it away in evidence 
[02:24:30]  containers.  He's an ex-copter, right?  He's an NYPD guy.  Oh, is that what it was?  Yeah.  Okay.  So then he knew to grab this stuff.  I might need to, I might need to, I'm going to cover my ass.  I might need to.  That's what he said, man.  Wow.  I'm telling you.  And Clemens has to be shitting his pants, I would think.  Right.  Let's go to Sean in Texas.  Sean.  Good evening.  Morning.  Hey, Sean.  How are you?  Good.  What's up, man?  About Ron Paul.  I read on the news yesterday, he's suspending his presidential campaign because he's in danger 
[02:25:00]  of losing his congressional seat.  All right, well.  Hmm.  All right.  Is that right?  There's such a hoopla about this guy.  Hoopla.  He's got a big, guy's in the middle of a big, big shitstorm, as we say.  He's getting crazy.  Where the hell have we been?  I mean, I'm going to lose my seat if I keep talking about the cons to you people.  I'm going to hear his voice right now.  We've got to get some Ron Paul audio.  They all beat up.  They all, like, pick on him and shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They all roll their eyes while he's talking. 
[02:25:30]  You know, they're like, ah, here he is again.  That is nuts.  Talking about the Constitution.  That's a stupid article.  Talk about fucking, uh, and talk about freedom of speech oppressing fucks.  In Berkeley, California, they're fighting the Marine Recruiting Station.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, it's like, why wouldn't you allow it to be there and just disagree with your community?  Because they're intolerant cunts.  Yeah.  Fucking.  They're intolerant fucks, and they preach tolerance.  Ugh.  I just.  They are the worst, man. 
[02:26:00]  So.  It's a hypocrisy, man.  Just don't give them any federal funding.  Let the.  Mm-hmm.  You know, I'd actually give Al-Qaeda maps to that fucking part of California.  And go, go ahead.  You know what?  We won't do anything.  Go ahead.  Hit it.  Yeah.  We'll keep it under our hats.  Take it out.  Look at her.  I like the.  Wow.  What a doll.  Which one?  Megan Kendall.  Let's say hi to Wes, the trucker.  Wes.  Good morning.  Welcome aboard, Wes.  What's up, Wes?  Hey, I just want to make this quick, man.  I bought a.  I've never done steroids, but I have a GH kit or HGH. 
[02:26:30]  Same thing.  Mm-hmm.  And within my first shot, I took a shot one hour before I hit the gym.  And it was obvious, like straight.  Is that right?  Really?  That quick?  You can tell that quick.  Tall latte?  Yeah.  I mean, that's just one injection.  One little.  Fight him.  One injection.  It didn't work that fast.  Yeah, because the paper said it didn't. 
[02:27:00]  You know, Clemens, they said they shot his wife up before the photo shoot.  Yeah.  And the guy said, some expert said, no, it doesn't.  It's got to be.  It's an overtime thing.  Yeah.  It takes a lot faster, but.  You have a great imagination, man.  Guy's like, yeah, put an extra 200 on the bench.  Oh, my neck.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, within.  Okay.  Right over his head.  Within about two weeks.  Within about two weeks, my squats went up about 80 pounds.  Yeah.  Beautiful.  So, and that's not even using steroids. 
[02:27:30]  So, I mean, I'm sure, you know, if you start juicing, you know, you're 45 years old and  you're in a ball, you know, 100 mile an hour, you know.  So, what are you squatting, fella?  I'm putting up 315, 10 times.  And you need that for what?  And you need that for what?  Well, I work at a furniture store and sometimes the bunny boy sofa is, you know, getting him  off the truck and be a bitch.  Alone.  You know, the average Mexican weighing six ounces. 
[02:28:00]  So, I have to.  You know, Nick, you bring up a great point, man.  I'm in the gym three or four days a week and, like, I can, my triceps, I'm over 100 pounds  now.  And then I'm like, yeah, but what am I going to do with this?  You're so right.  What a waste of fucking time.  Well, I finally, you know, I finally, a couple years ago, after years of, you know, I've  had shoulder surgery.  I got, like, permanent staples in my chest.  Finally.  You just said.  About five years ago, I just.  Yeah.  If I fucking lift twice a month. 
[02:28:30]  It's like, go for a walk and get your heart rate up.  That's all you need.  I'm telling you.  Why are we lifting our muscles off?  It all comes down to cardio after a while.  He's so right, man.  Yeah, I'll just do some step aerobics.  Like some fag.  I know.  I used to laugh at people who walked on the Stairmaster.  I'm that fucking guy now.  I walked for an hour, you know, at a fast pace uphill and shit.  Yeah.  Why the fuck do we need big triceps?  You see a guy in his fifties, you know, give me a couple of force reps.  Why?  Well, you know, I fucking work at Kinko's and I need 78 inch guns to impress the fucking 18 
[02:29:00]  year old chick that might want to fuck me behind the copier.  Stop with that shit.  My, I used to, I mean, you know, I look at my physique though.  Quinn always, Colin goes, Colin goes, you know, people look at Quinn and they look at  me and he goes, yeah, you look like the guy, they look at him and they go, he used to be  in shape.  You know.  Hey, we got a big star waiting here.  Amy, Amy Ryan, everyone.  How are you? 
[02:29:30]  I'm well.  Good morning.  Hi, Amy.  I just saw Gone Baby Gone last night, actually.  Oh.  Are you a good actress or are you really just evil in, in real life?  No, I'm a real skank.  I'm just a good, I'm just down Boston.  She plays a, uh, a white trash skank.  Absolutely.  With not a care in the world for her own child.  Oh man, did I hate you.  I was watching that movie.  I'm like, man, I want to smack this bitch.  Really? 
[02:30:00]  Yes.  She knows.  I mean, this is a compliment, trust me.  Too bad you didn't have her in the studio.  Yeah, right.  You, uh, you, you received the Golden Globe and Oscar nomination for this role, man.  It's pretty amazing.  Wow.  Thank you.  Yeah, congratulations.  And, uh, you want to, uh, explain the movie for the people out there that haven't seen  it yet?  Oh, Gone Baby Gone is a story set in, uh, Dorchester, outside of Boston.  I love it.  And our story of a four-year-old girl who gets kidnapped and, uh, the police can't find 
[02:30:30]  her and private investigators can't find her and we soon find out why, because of this  dirty mom that you...  Oh, you are dirty, Amy.  Sounds good.  Amy is a dirty mom.  I have it at home.  I, I haven't seen it.  I'm so irritated because everybody's saying it's great.  You get it at home?  Oh, it's really good.  Ben Affleck did an incredible job.  It's his directing debut.  To burn it?  Yeah.  I've heard all good things about it, though.  Even, you know who?  Filthy Quinn, who hates every movie?  Yeah.  He actually said it's pretty good.  Anyway, it was, was, was Casey Affleck in this, too?  Oh, yeah.  He's a star.  He's the leading man of it, yeah. 
[02:31:00]  He was really good and, and, and his brother Ben is the, the director.  I know, because I did Leno with Ben and he was promoting this.  Was he really?  Oh, well, Jimmy.  That's what he was promoting.  Well, I did Letterman a couple of years ago.  I was on with Tony Danza.  What I liked about the movie is there was a lot of twists and, uh, turns there, Amy.  Yeah.  Yeah, when you thought the movie was over, then it wasn't over.  Yeah.  It was very good.  I, I, I really enjoyed it.  Amy, where are you from?  Can I ask?  I'm from Queens.  Oh, you did, did, so did you have to learn the Boston accent? 
[02:31:30]  Yes, I did, yeah.  I mean, I knew, I knew a little bit of it, but, uh, I picked up the, the rest of it  when we were on set in George Chester.  Because I love watching people try to do, even the most talented act is, like, Nicholson,  even in the part, it's just kind of, like, mailed it in.  Yeah.  He's like, I can't.  And then you got the other, like, Martin Sheen's always doing, like, Kennedy.  Anybody who tries to do Boston accent, they just do Kennedy.  The coach goes, just do Kennedy.  Stand up, my daughter was missing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a bit more, it's a little, little, little more than dropping 
[02:32:00]  your R's.  It's kind of the same with, uh, people that try to put on a Brooklyn accent, and they're  from California, and they try that, it doesn't come off sounding right.  You might have a couple of words that are passable, then the rest just sounds like some Laguna Beach  asshole trying to sound like they're from Brooklyn.  Well, no matter how hard they try, they just can't sound dumb enough.  It's like, we know you're not from here.  Yeah.  Hey, and Gone Baby Gone is on DVD today?  That's right, it comes out today on DVD. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  I'm going to get it today, and I'm not kidding.  I'm telling you, it was a really good movie.  I'm not kidding, I've heard nothing but good things about it.  There, there is, there's a lot of times we've got to make believe a movie was good, but  in this case, this one was really good.  That's what I heard.  Yeah, Gone Baby Gone is definitely.  Well, thank you, I'm really honored.  Yeah, no, I'm not even kidding.  We do, like, play the game sometimes.  This is actually a really good movie.  Amy, the writer's strike now, the Oscars, how frustrating is that, like, where the strike  of these award shows might not happen, and here you are nominated?  It's the end of the strike today.  Today, apparently, it's going to end, and I mean, I've always wanted the writers to get 
[02:33:00]  their due no matter what, but I'm very hopeful that today it's all over and we'll get to go  to the Oscars.  Why can't we get one person...  I'm always going to have to answer to my mother.  Why can't we get one actress or actor on the phone that says, you know, I just want them  to suffer, and I want their lives to be ruined by this strike, because we don't write our  own crap.  That's right.  I just want one person, you know, they're assholes to me, and they wrote a bad part for me back  in 95.  I hope they die. 
[02:33:30]  Sorry, Amy.  Who are you up against, Amy?  Oh, yeah, it's kind of an insane category.  Cate Blanchett and Ruby Dee, Tilda Swinton, and Saoirse Ronan.  Well, Ruby Dee is very old.  Cate Blanchett, we're all tired of, so I think you have a good shot.  What's his best supporting?  Are you a member of the Academy?  No, I believe there's a lot of decisions I would have probably given Raging Bull best  picture over ordinary people, but, you know, that's just me.  And that's not being outrageous, though.  That should have happened. 
[02:34:00]  That's what I'm saying, of course.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey...  I thought you were going for a joke there.  No, no, no.  That's true.  A married girl, are you, Miss Ryan?  No, I'm not married.  No?  Of course not.  You're a bitch.  Hopi, what does she look like?  Oh, I was just wondering, because I just popped the picture up.  No, she's cute.  Very, very cute.  Oh, right here?  See, I can't separate you people from the movie, so I just think you're a bitch in real  life, Amy.  She looks like she's from Butchers.  Sorry.  You're also on what is probably my favorite show, which is The Wire. 
[02:34:30]  The Wire.  Everybody loves B.D. Russell.  You're great.  That's going to make up for Helene McCready.  Hey, how frustrating was it?  Because in season two, I mean, you had a tremendous role, and then, you know, the way they do  it every year, it's a different theme, so in season three, they kind of, they switch  focus, and it seemed that was more on politics before the kids in season four.  How frustrating was it to have this massive role, and then all of a sudden, kind of,  you know, out of the cold in a way?  Well, it's not that frustrating. 
[02:35:00]  I'm a huge fan of that show, so I was kind of excited to see each year that the show,  you know, switches locations, subject matters, but no, I moved on to do other things, and  if I were still doing that, I wouldn't be in Gone Baby Gone.  That's true.  I'm such a dope.  She's out for a reason.  You're nominated for an Oscar, and I'm going to get bummed out.  You're not in the weekly series anymore.  Yeah, that took the sting out of it a little bit.  Why aren't you in Baltimore?  Why are you going to the Oscars?  Shit, I've got to buy another dress and pick up a trophy. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, I don't think she's too bummed, Jimmy.  Well, you're back this year.  What's that?  You're back this year on The Wire.  Yeah, I am.  It's our fifth.  We wrapped the season this past August, and yeah, old Beattie is back with McNulty.  Why are they only doing five?  That's so, because McNulty, for anyone that hasn't watched, is a drunk.  He's a total alky, and you're beginning just to have enough of his womanizing and his  alcoholism.  Why are they only doing five seasons?  It's really bothering me.  I think just because, well, that was David Simon's whole plan, the creator and writer 
[02:36:00]  of The Wire, and he's on to his next project.  And, you know, you've got to get out before you jump the shark, as they say.  Wow, yeah, okay.  You know?  You're supposed to leave a party when you're having a really good time, not when you're  drunk and broke in the corner.  I don't know what that's like.  I don't know what leaving a party's like.  We've got to learn that lesson, trust me.  I like to lay with puke on my shirt and handcuffs.  All right, so the movie comes out today on DVD, and you've also worked with Sidney 
[02:36:30]  Lumet.  You've worked with Eastwood.  I mean, you've really worked with some great directors, especially Lumet, Larry Storch.  Yeah, yeah.  He's a legend.  He's amazing.  I worked with him on his show, the TV show, 100 Central Street, and then his film, Before  the Devil Knows You're Dead.  He's amazing.  Was that a good movie?  I have not.  That's an awkward question.  That's a really good movie.  I saw that one.  It's a great movie.  It starred Bill T. Hoffman and Ethan Hawke and Marissa Tomei.  Oh, very cool.  That's a great movie.  I saw that one.  And you're doing Letterman tomorrow night, huh?  I am. 
[02:37:00]  I'm really nervous.  Have you done it before?  No.  Ah, here.  I'll give you a little advice that was given to me by Luke Wilson.  None other than Luke Wilson, the first time that I did Letterman, I was very nervous also.  And he told me, he goes, have a couple of beers backstage.  He goes, but don't overdo it, or else you'll walk out there and look silly because you'll  be drunk.  But it loosens you up enough where you're not completely freaking out when they're saying  your name and you have to do the little walk out to the chair. 
[02:37:30]  God, I'll be the one who falls, trips on her face.  Try not to do that.  Who are you on with?  Do you know?  I don't know.  I like telling my Luke Wilson story.  It's almost like I'm famous.  Yeah.  I mean, you asked, what did Luke say?  He said, don't bang Kurt Russell's daughter.  It never works that good in the end.  Well, you remember.  That's his brother.  Hey, look.  What do I want to tell you?  That wasn't Luke.  No, I know.  That's what I'm saying.  He was giving advice on Owen's head.  Right.  Jesus, what do you guys read?  People every day? 
[02:38:00]  What the fuck are you talking about?  What are you talking about?  You know, come on.  He was dating, I couldn't remember her name.  Kate something.  Can you say bang on the radio?  You can say fucking bang.  We're on satellite.  We're on uncensored.  Yeah.  Nobody's here on the same.  Yeah.  You can say whatever you want.  Oh, my.  Do you have a potty mouth?  Do I?  Yeah.  Sometimes.  Yeah.  You know, I'm from Queens.  Yeah, that's true.  Give us a good one and then watch what happens.  Good curse.  No.  I actually had a really bad potty mouth after Gone Baby Gone. 
[02:38:30]  It took me about two, three weeks to stop saying some of that.  What was something bad you said?  I honestly have not seen it yet.  Well, Helene thinks everything smells like cack.  Oh, that's so great.  Cack?  Everything smells like cack.  I say fucking cack.  Cack.  Cack.  Cack.  That's all right.  That's the character I don't like.  I like cock.  That's how Boston goes.  Yeah, I can't even do the Boston accent. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah, it's cock.  Cack.  Yeah, there you go.  Right there.  Cack.  Yeah, almost like cock.  Because I used to hear girls say that all the time.  Is it true?  Put your cock away.  Yeah, I wish you had a bigger...  Stripping out of your cock.  There you go.  It's cocking.  We got Amy Ryan on the phone here.  You have to watch an accent.  Hey, Amy, is it true your friends refer to you as Crying Ryan?  Oh, my gosh.  Yeah, they do.  But that's because on TV, you know, when I've done a bunch of, like, episodics and suddenly, 
[02:39:30]  like, you know, my daddy touched me.  Oh, you're that one, huh?  Crying Ryan.  There she goes again.  I weak lacronal glands, I guess you'd say.  I was just looking at that, like, wow, you've done a lot of episodes of a lot of TV series.  Oh, yeah, you are.  Chicago Hulk.  Yeah, like Chicago Hulk.  Law and Order.  She's a working actor.  Homicide.  Amy, are you able to, like, really...  Like, a lot of actors, when they cry, they do the face, but nothing comes out. 
[02:40:00]  Are you able to actually tear up on film?  Yeah, I get the snot, too, out of the nose.  Oh, that's great.  Oh, that's great.  Oh, that's great.  Nice.  No, it doesn't bubble.  It just drips.  What do you think of that makes you that sad?  I'm getting hungry.  Amy, what do you think of?  Because I do a little acting myself.  I'm not in your league.  Like, when I have to cry, I take both of my pointer fingers and I crook them, and I rub  them under my eyes, and I go, boo-hoo.  I'm not particularly good or funny. 
[02:40:30]  So, what do you think of that makes you really sad?  Besides that attempt at humor.  What do you think of that makes you sad enough to cry?  Yeah, now she's going to cry.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I can't give away my tricks.  Why?  Because it won't work for anyone else.  Do you do what Burt Reynolds used to do?  He used to pluck a nose hair out?  Would he really?  Yeah.  He'd pull a nose hair out.  Well, he had none real on his head.  He probably had to go for the nose.  This was back when he was a stud.  But he used to pull a nose hair out.  I don't know.  It would make your eyes tear. 
[02:41:00]  It does make your eyes tear.  I don't know.  I don't believe he should torture yourself.  Yeah, he probably shouldn't do that.  He used to twist his balls in a vice and think about Sally Field being teabagged by two  of the Lakers.  And all of a sudden, the waterworks would happen.  Jesus Christ.  But I'm saying, like, there's a lady on the phone here.  I like Amy very much.  She's on The Wire.  There's some very great vitals.  Hey, listen.  She deals with those people.  All right.  Well, I wanted to know what you thought of because I think you're a great actress.  Hey, with Gone Baby Gone hitting DVD today, could you tell us how the movie ends? 
[02:41:30]  No.  I haven't seen it.  What happened?  What?  Don't you dare.  Let's see how brave she is.  She's from Queens.  She's got...  It's a great edge of your seat movie.  It's not just a whodummit.  Not if I'm on a couch.  You know, I think people will be pleasantly surprised.  Did you like the ending?  Yeah, I do very much.  Yeah.  I like that it doesn't wrap it up in a Hollywood big bow.  Good.  Yeah, absolutely.  It really gets people talking.  I was hoping it was going to end the other way. 
[02:42:00]  Me too.  The credits not rolling.  Yeah.  No, but I definitely...  It was a really, really good movie.  It was definitely a different type of movie too, which I enjoy.  Yeah.  Thank you.  And Amy, you were great in it.  Thank you.  I hope everyone gets to see it now.  Well, good luck to you at the Oscars and all that.  I mean, I really do hope you...  I'm a fan and you're tremendous on The Wire.  Thank you.  And, you know, you're really great.  Oh, you know what?  Michael K. Williams, who plays Omar, is also in Gone Baby Gone. 
[02:42:30]  Is he really?  I'm a The Wire fan.  Yeah, it's kind of switch.  I'm kind of the bad guy and he's the good guy.  He's...  He plays a cop.  He's having a really good season five too.  Omar, to me, is one...  He's an amazing actor.  He really is great.  Is he gay in real life?  I mean, you're not outing him.  Is he open about being gay or is he not gay?  I don't think he is, but I don't know him, you know, personally.  So I don't know about his personal life.  Yeah, because I don't think you had any scenes with him.  And I don't think he is.  Wow.  If he's not gay, there's scenes where he's like tenderly kissing other men.  He's really great.  If he's not gay, he's a better actor than I thought.  That's not tough to do. 
[02:43:00]  Would you take that role, Jimmy?  Would you tenderly kiss other men?  If I could play it as good as he did and be the great character he is, of course I would.  You really would, huh?  To be Omar on The Wire, the guy's fantastic.  That would be rough.  That's the best character ever on TV.  It really is.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, now.  Hold on over here.  But he's great.  He's a very believable...  Yeah, because they don't...  Better than fucking Tony Soprano?  Come on.  Stop with this shit.  Well...  I like Tony Soprano, but please.  I prefer Omar, but...  It's only because he's shooting people and now they get laid. 
[02:43:30]  Tony wasn't really acting, though.  That's the problem.  That was just him.  Yeah, check out Michael Williamson.  Right.  There was no acting there.  All right.  Well, I didn't know that.  He has a good personality in real life.  Okay.  Will you play a cop?  Carmella.  Yeah.  You guys are bold talking about James Gandolfini that way.  I know.  He'd knock you out.  I didn't say that.  He's crazy.  He's going to come kick your ass.  Ooh.  I've been working on my triceps.  I'm not worried.  I'd love you to...  See?  Don't mess with me.  Now I know why I was doing my triceps. 
[02:44:00]  There you go.  All right.  So, Amy, could you do that cock line one more time before we let you go?  I don't know where her mother is.  I don't know.  I can't remember it.  It smells like...  Everything smells like fucking...  It smells like cock in here.  There you go.  Cock.  There you go.  Now apply your Boston.  I'm from Boston.  She said it perfectly.  Now apply your best Boston.  Oh, you are, too.  What am I saying?  All right.  Cock.  Cock.  Thank you, Amy, so much.  And good luck at the Austin.  We really do hope you win.  Thank you very much.  All right.  I'm going to get the movie tonight.  Take care, Amy.  Actually, because I've heard so much about it.  Thank you, Amy. 
[02:44:30]  She's really cool, man.  Take care.  Thanks for calling.  All right.  Bye.  All right.  She was on the phone.  I'm glad I didn't see anything bad.  She was really nice.  I'm like a dick.  What happened?  Kenny in the comments from a different place.  What?  Oh, is it?  Oh, tuna fish.  Kenny just runs around all morning getting food.  Where is Kenny?  Is he around?  Mm-hmm.  What's he, a bodyguard or something?  He's a little weird thing.  Huh?  He's a gopher, a bodyguard, a retard. 
[02:45:00]  He's my road manager.  A dried-haired ass.  He's a guy I bring on the road for security and to do everything.  He's an ex-cop.  He's a very, I was going to say.  He comes in handy.  He looks like a ass kicker.  He tells stories about the old day, because he was on for us when, you know, you could  do things.  Right.  And he talks about some fun stories that tune in people up.  We didn't used to just bring everybody in.  Sometimes we'd drop them off after we'd beat them senseless.  So I told McCluskey, just have them held up and hit them. 
[02:45:30]  How's the Italian food here?  Dummy.  I love that question.  Worst question ever.  How's the Italian food in this place?  I don't know how that went into the script.  I fucking, I picked it up when I was 10.  I'm like, what the fuck kind of question is that?  It sucks, but the Mexican is delicious.  Try the sushi, stupid.  What the fuck?  That dumb Mick, what did he know?  Fucking McCluskey.  Hey, how's the Italian food here? 
[02:46:00]  Shut up.  It's going to be coming out your throat in a second.  I'm going to talk to Michael in Mexican, okay?  Yeah, whatever you got to do.  Just call me old spaghetti larynx.  What's his name?  Sterling Hayden.  He's like, he was like a lady in the 50s.  Ever seen these like black and white?  He's like a handsome.  Oh, one of those guys, yeah.  It's funny.  It's amazing.  He's just some old haggard cop.  Yeah.  I believe it was called The Killer or The Killing by Kubrick. 
[02:46:30]  He's got quite a resume.  Yeah.  He's got some Sarah, like Angela Lansbury and shit.  She was like a lady.  Yeah, she was like supposed to be a hottie.  Yeah.  Just that named.  What is it?  I know.  One of my oldest jokes.  I was so awful when I started.  This is, I hate Angela Lansbury.  Her show, I wish it was called Murdered.  She was.  Oh God, don't.  Just don't.  Why?  Hey, we're going over your tape tomorrow. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah.  Jimmy's first time on TV from like 10, 11 years ago.  Friday night videos from 96 or 97.  Yeah, Nick, we bring in old tapes of ourselves and just beat each other up.  So tomorrow it's Jimmy's turn.  I sucked a fucking uncut dick.  I was horrendous.  Just high energy, please love me.  Just a desperate little character.  How we doing?  Hey.  Fucking asshole.  You put on a little voice.  Hi.  First TV show I ever did was a Joan London show. 
[02:47:30]  Wow.  Really?  Bring it in.  Joan London.  Bring it in.  The studio is in New Jersey.  She's fucking heckling me as I'm doing my stand-up.  Oh shit.  She's like, do the stuff about your father.  Really?  Yes.  Well, I'm doing stand-up.  Shut the fuck up.  That's how the look I gave him.  We got Sydney on Instant Feedback from Kentucky.  Hey guys, if Ron Paul buying ads on the virus didn't get your attention, nothing will.  He's giving you guys money for God's sakes.  Oh really?  He actually made a commercial on our chat. 
[02:48:00]  Did he?  I'm not sure if that's the commercial.  Oh my God.  We got Ron Paul audio because I got to hear Nixon.  Let's hear Ron Paul a little bit.  I mean, we're going to take a break and see where our omelets are.  Where is this?  Right here.  Okay.  I'm Ron Paul and I'm the only presidential candidate who will bring our troops home from  Iraq immediately and stop wasteful government spending.  But here's something else I care about and I hope you do too.  The war on terror and the growth of big government have had a dangerous side effect.  The loss of privacy rights for the American people. 
[02:48:30]  That's bullshit.  Both parties have put their pet schemes ahead of our rights.  Fucking liar.  Not me.  As president, I won't stand for it.  No national ID card, no invasion of privacy.  What?  I'm Ron Paul and I approve this message.  That's where he lost me, right?  Yeah, right.  You know something?  Will you, somebody, can you name one person that has fucking had their civil rights violated?  Do you know anybody who knows anybody?  I don't know anybody.  Who fucking knows anybody.  Who got like hauled away in the middle of the night.  Thank you.  For saying something or did something and it was caught on camera and they got in trouble. 
[02:49:00]  One of these little cameras that are hitting around.  No.  Because if you just go about your business.  And what the fuck is the problem with the national fucking identification card?  Do you ever have a passport?  Do you ever get a driver's license?  Do you ever fucking social security?  Here's the fucking problem with that stupid thing.  If they want to know your name, they can see it.  Exactly.  I want privacy.  You got to show ID to do anything.  Exactly.  To get a fucking, to get that movie tonight that Amy Ryan's in. 
[02:49:30]  I got to show my fucking ID.  Yeah, show your fucking ID.  And what's the problem then?  A national ID.  Oh, why?  Because it's a government issued thing?  What do you call a license or a passport?  Thank you.  It's that paranoia of the government.  Yeah.  You know, after Watergate that's still fucking awesome.  Ah, they were going to get in there and once they have that.  Yeah, what?  Ask Jose Padilla about his rifle.  The guy that was caught with a dirty bomb and fucking.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Amits are here.  Break time.  Nick was fucking.  Who gives a shit about politics?  Opie and Anthony.  Nick DiPaolo. 
[02:50:00]  Bergata.  Saturday night.  Hit the spots.  We got to eat.  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we're about to take a break now at Opie and Anthony and Jim  Norton.  That's our coming.  He's going to keep you smiling.  And we want you to be right there when we come back.  So don't take that down.  We'll be right back.  All right.  The show continued during the break.  Talking about legs and cleavage and sexual harassment. 
[02:50:30]  HR.  What kinds of fun, good stuff.  Well, Nick is in agreement.  You got the girls in the workplace looking hot as hell.  And the guy snaps every once in a while and it's his problem.  I just don't get that.  You come to work with all your cleavage showing and we're not supposed to look at it.  You get in trouble for just looking at cleavage at this point.  Yeah, you can't even look.  You can't compliment.  You can't really do anything. 
[02:51:00]  If you do the up, down, it's actually we read the manuals that they give you for sexual  harassment and all that crap written by some chick with a fucking goatee.  Exactly.  You're not even supposed to do the up, down with your eyes.  That's a natural fucking thing that you do.  If someone attractive, an attractive woman walks in the door, you're going to do the up, down.  I did it to Chuck Liddell, for Christ's sake. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, you got to give Chuck the up, down.  I don't want to fuck him.  I just want to make sure.  They want the benefits.  Just sizing up your, you know.  They want the benefits of dressing sexy.  They want the benefits of using that advantage when they want it.  But they don't want anybody who they don't want looking at them looking at them.  It really is irritating.  I think a lot of the broads don't even agree with it.  You know what I mean?  No.  A lot of the few office, that's the beauty of being in stand-up for the last 20 years.  I haven't been in an office.  But when I did, when I get thrown into CBS, I have my own gig. 
[02:52:00]  You know, I didn't know any of those rules applied.  I'm like, nice tits.  Oh, everybody's looking at me.  What are you, an asshole?  What the fuck did I say?  You can't say that.  You can do an 84 when I get out of college.  They're like, yeah, that was over a fucking quarter century ago.  Yeah, human resources for a radio station.  I have never acknowledged that they exist.  They've been part of radio now for, I think, close to 10 years.  I don't even acknowledge them.  I'm like, stop.  This isn't like, you know, fucking, give me a company out there. 
[02:52:30]  IBM.  Exxon!  Exxon!  Those boys over at IBM.  No, that's the go-to one.  This isn't IBM.  It's a dumb radio show at a dumb radio station playing a few Zeppelin and Red Hot Chili Pepper  records.  I mean, you know, we shouldn't be in the same category as the IBM guys.  Yeah, and if you're working at IBM and you're a chick and you're wearing a really short skirt  and your tits are hanging out, they should be able to fuck you on the copier without any repercussions.  Because we're visual creatures, right, Nick?  Exactly.  Guys are very, very visual creatures. 
[02:53:00]  That's right.  We like to look at a girl's breasts.  Their fucking nipples poking through.  Yeah, I like the fucking nipples.  I like to twist them until they say uncle.  That's right.  When I did my little fucking three lines on the Sopranos, you know, we had the read-around  the day before.  Yeah.  What's her name?  Drea DeMatteo?  Oh, yeah.  Like, sitting across from me with like a skirt. 
[02:53:30]  She looks like the young Madonna.  I missed my fucking line.  Really?  I was staring right at her fucking crotch.  Could you see anything?  And I still got the gig.  Nice.  Well, I had it at that point, but they were all laughing.  I went, oh, sorry.  What was that?  How embarrassing.  That's great.  Hey, we're going back in time a little bit.  Anthony was talking about the ninth annual HBO Young Comedian special.  Yes.  And we got a couple highlights of the special that you were talking about.  Some lowlights.  Well, we got Richie Gold.  Oh, Jesus. 
[02:54:00]  I remember that one all.  I, uh, yeah.  I was watching last night and just going, oh, my God.  Was this ever funny?  And then you realize a lot of the shit was new, but it just, after about five years, it  became such hack.  Yeah.  And everyone was doing it because there were 10 million comics out there.  Thank God that shit got weeded down.  Yeah, exactly.  Remember how many shows there were?  Oh.  Every fucking Friday and Saturday night, you'd flip around the channels, and it's another 
[02:54:30]  dork in front of a brick wall with the fucking suspenders.  I was going to say, it was 100 channels of brick fucking walls.  Brick walls.  Fucking flipped his house.  With wacky fucking logos and names and thin ties.  And guys just with the same shit over and over.  What's up with all the cursing?  Sean Hannity's going to be listening to this later today.  Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Hannity.  Sean, if you're listening to this, we apologize.  The rolled up shirt sleeves.  Yeah.  The fucking suit jacket all rolled up.  You know, I was noticing. 
[02:55:00]  Thin ties.  Thin ties.  What are you noticing?  That after 1992, you'll fucking still be working for $80 a week?  You fucking non-writer.  What do you want to hear some Richie?  Richie Gold?  I do.  I don't even know what Richie Gold does.  Oh, boy.  Listen to this.  That's not a good sound, Nick.  What year is this?  Do we have a year?  Do collect residual checks.  What year is this, Nick?  When you did HBO?  80.  According to his material, 1876.  This was on HBO, ladies and gentlemen. 
[02:55:30]  I got to tell you something, you know.  I haven't always been a comedian.  At one time, I taught in the New York City school system.  Speech therapist guy?  Yeah, I was a speech teacher.  Oh, speech teacher.  I had a lot of famous students.  I thought Sylvester Stallone had a talk.  He's a voice.  You know what?  Let me tell you about Richie Gold.  He came to Boston when I was first starting out at Nick's Comedy Club.  Where they throw the... 
[02:56:00]  And he was, like, pretty popular, Richie Gold.  He was a national headliner.  Comes up to Boston.  He's a headliner at Nick's.  I was there this night, too.  And Nick's is infamous for bringing out-of-towners who think they're hot shit.  And putting on Sweeney, Gavin, all these guys who are gods.  And he was the...  And I saw it.  Chance Langton came in.  Gavin was the host, who's the funniest guy in the face of the earth.  Sweeney came in.  They threw Sweeney on.  And then it was supposed to be, like, Kevin Knox. 
[02:56:30]  And then Richie Gold is supposed to be the headliner.  Chance Langton comes in with his guitar.  Well, you know, I hate song parents, but he was the best in the world at it.  They put him on.  I mean, fucking standing ovation.  350 people.  And then they bring this guy up.  Fucking crickets.  Oh, shit.  They wanted to murder him 30 seconds.  He's got that heavy New York accent.  And fucking these Irish kids from, like, selfies.  Yeah, you suck.  Yeah, fucking these Irish kids with red eyelashes.  They go, fuck you, you fucking red eyelashes. 
[02:57:00]  Red fucking eyelashes.  You know, the one with the really blonde.  Every bit of hair is red on them.  Yes, and then they get these mean freckled faces, and they give them the finger and shit.  Oh, my God, did he take a beating.  And everybody's giggling, you know.  It's like, fuck, man.  I didn't have a chance.  Let's go to Shane in the Bronx.  Shane, what's up?  If you listen very closely, that sounds like Club Soda Kenyan in his early years.  Have a good day, gentlemen.  All right, there is a little Club Soda Kenyan there.  You want to hear a little more?  Yeah, he's not fair.  Yeah.  All right.  France has an ambassador. 
[02:57:30]  Come to France, see the Eiffel Tower.  England has an ambassador.  Come to England, see the Queen.  So I'm thinking, in America, every state is the size of most countries.  So why not have an ambassador from every state?  For example, the ambassador from New Jersey.  Bruno, three fingers for Nelly.  Hey, come to Atlantic City.  Hey, 10 to 1, you don't make it.  Holy shit.  Quater of Sparks.  Where was it, Rascals?  They're right.  Fucking West Orange special?  They're roaring.  You hear that?  It must have been like, you know, West Orange. 
[02:58:00]  By the way, this isn't that bad.  No.  Right?  No, he was, you know.  This isn't that bad.  No, I see some really awful ones.  Yeah, yeah.  I was just watching last night.  It was some awful shit.  This one guy.  As soon as I was in England, I was in a restaurant.  I asked him if that had English muffins.  They never heard of him.  No gag.  Well, yeah, but when you're in England, the muffins would...  Oh, I see.  You would think to call them something else over there.  I'm going to try that one in my gig at the Borgata.  Saturday. 
[02:58:30]  Saturday.  How about Maurice LaMarche or LaMarche?  No, I don't remember him.  Not her.  L-A-M-A-R-C-H-E.  Oh, LaMarche.  Not Maurice.  The black Maurice.  No.  No.  This is TV.  He's the master impressionist.  Oh, I love impersonation.  Oh, I do, too.  He does these impersonations.  You'd think it was the real people.  People ask me, how did you get started doing impressions?  I really had to watch a lot of television when I was a kid.  And I got my impressionist teeth on Saturday morning TV.  That's good.  Natasha, we must get Moose and Squirrel. 
[02:59:00]  Yes, Maurice, darling.  Fluffer and Flackatash.  Oh, my George.  Quincy Magoo, you've done it again.  Phineas Jay, what were y'all the greatest?  Come along, Chumlee.  Do you see, Tennessee?  That's from HBO?  That's on HBO, son.  Jesus Christ.  There's nothing more degrading than somebody doing somebody else's voice.  Damn.  Was that an HBO sprayer? 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  I missed that one.  I thought I had a call on it.  Okay, Fred.  Come on, Betty.  Come on, Bam Bam.  The Ranger's going to like this.  Wow.  No, I didn't.  Where can I get a seat?  Let's get Dan involved.  Well, Stan, what did you think?  Yes, Stan.  Good impressionist or what? 
[03:00:00]  He's good.  Well, at least he didn't do that awful thing where you said, like, somebody did on Last  Comic last season, like, imagine Jack Nicholson and, you know, J.J. Walker and the Wizard  of Oz.  Why would you imagine that?  That's good.  I imagine that all the time, and now I'm actually going to get to see someone act it out.  They actually ask you.  Can you imagine?  Can you imagine?  And there's a reason no one else has up to this point, you dink.  I'm actually imagining you dropping dead.  Can I see that? 
[03:00:30]  Well, he does a little more.  Let's see.  Oh.  My favorite stars.  Oh, no.  A tribute.  Oh, boy.  He's turning around right now.  It might be.  Remember me?  I just want you all to know that Maurice Lamarge is a very close and personal friend of my brother  Billy.  Maurice makes me proud to say that I'm an American.  That's because she's a Canadian.  Can you keep going backwards? 
[03:01:00]  Do some Eisenhower.  Is she a comic?  Jesus, I forgot.  I just thought he was doing great with you.  Arthur.  Arthur.  Oh.  I am Arthur.  Where the hell's my hat?  Where do I hate it when that happens?  I'll race cars.  I'll play tennis.  I'll phone the women.  But I have weekends off and I am my own boss.  Hobson, do you want to run my bath for me? 
[03:01:30]  He's just doing the whole movie.  It's not even like a funny situation.  It's not even written jokes.  You should be, you know.  Have Arthur getting blown in a hot tub by Jimmy Walker.  At least mix it up a little bit.  That's my hat.  And there's pudding in it.  Oh, shit.  I've got the club foot and pudding under my wig.  When I sneeze, it sounds like a fish tank being shook around.  Shooker, shooker, shooker.  Got a lump in me head, Hobson. 
[03:02:00]  And in me shoe.  From head to toe.  I'm no good.  I don't even sound like him.  I can't even play chopsticks on the piano with my pudding brain.  That's right.  I can't believe I like this needle-nosed ugly cunt Liza.  Susan Johnson caught a suck in my dick by a horse sable.  Boo.  Boo.  Hey, we're the assholes, though.  This is Maurice LaMarche.  He does great.  He sounds great voices. 
[03:02:30]  I mean, I'll say that.  Why, is he a millionaire now or something?  Well, he does half the voices on Futurama.  He also does voices on a little show called The Simpsons.  Are you fucking kidding me, son of a bitch?  I knew he was good.  I thought he was very good.  This fucker.  And he does the voice of the brain.  That's glad I'm trying to write socially relevant jokes and shit.  And fucking dying in obscurity.  Look at us making fun of a guy that's a multi-millionaire doing very, very well out there in Hollywood.  I had Tennessee Tuxedo Don in fourth fucking grade.  And this motherfucking parlayed it into a zillion dollars. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  And if that wasn't good enough, most of the Animaniacs' voices.  And, you know, a guy named Mel Blank died.  Well, he decided to do a lot of the voices from Looney Tunes.  Oh, Jesus.  Mel Blank died.  This guy had a great agent.  Holy shit.  What may...  Yeah, so let's just keep laughing at the hack.  That idiot hack.  Because this was supposed to be, let's laugh at the hack bit.  He's doing these bits from the 43rd story of his house.  Right.  Jesus H. Christ.  I got a Tennessee Tuxedo in trouble. 
[03:03:30]  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  And what are we doing today?  We're going to say fuck another hundred times.  Hey, but...  You guys have done all right.  Don't kid yourself.  Oh, yeah.  I know.  But still.  All right.  We're going to move on to something else then.  That bit didn't work.  No more hack.  Well, no, because, you know, we don't like to tear down some of them.  Honestly, his voices sucked back then.  They were almost good.  Almost there.  They were just off, right?  He got there.  I guess he got it down and made a lot of money.  Certainly did.  Fuck him, I say.  Hey, we were talking about technology earlier today. 
[03:04:00]  With what?  The tracking?  Oh, the tracking.  There were a few things we were talking about.  There's a bit that's been kind of hanging around, and it's perfect for Nick, I think.  Commercials of biggest product failures ever.  Biggest product failures ever.  Commercials of biggest product?  Yeah.  Anthony's going to remember most of these.  Yeah, yeah.  I look at the list.  I remember...  Some of Fanny probably auditioned for most of them.  I remember about four of these.  You guys all blew them. 
[03:04:30]  Four of these.  So let's start with this fine commercial for Polar Vision.  Polar Vision.  Imagine if someone invented a wonderful box and gave you a way to catch little pieces  of your life so that you could see them again anytime by just dropping them into the box.  Now, wouldn't that be something?  Well, it is something.  Polar Vision.  Polaroids.  Instant movies.  Seconds after you shoot, you've got it.  And you'll still have it, even when certain persons go off to college. 
[03:05:00]  Or die.  Oh.  Instant movies, huh?  Wow.  I guess a little something called video killed that whole fucking idea, didn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What was that about?  What year was that?  I wish I...  You could develop film.  Oh, can I go backwards again?  You'd like the white guy once again being betrayed in a commercial as a mama luke.  Anyways.  A hairy white guy with no shirt on.  Unlikable fucking lump. 
[03:05:30]  As a surprise, the cop is white, though.  I know.  That did surprise me.  As his fat wife gets the shirt out of the dryer.  There you go.  Hey, this guy Chris from Oklahoma City, you guys interviewed him.  What?  Going backwards to comedian dude.  No.  Oh, they might be getting it confused with what's his name, who used to do Howie's show.  Billy West.  Billy West.  Thank you.  Oh, Billy, yeah.  Billy's good.  Because I don't think we interviewed...  See, I've got to look his name up again.  Maurice. 
[03:06:00]  No, I don't think so.  All right, so what do you got?  Polavision.  Do you remember this, Ant?  Yeah.  It was just like...  Because Polaroid put it out, it was just like their regular still cameras, but it was  with film.  And I remember it was pathetically short.  Like, you couldn't really film a lot.  A couple seconds.  Yeah, it was really short.  And it didn't come out very well.  And then video kind of killed it.  Do we know why these things failed?  Video.  Because any type of...  But any type of moving picture thing you would think would have done very well. 
[03:06:30]  Maybe it was right before something else.  Sometimes if they came out right before a much better technology, that's probably why.  Right.  What year was that?  Yeah.  42.  1942.  You got it, Dan?  First.  Late 70s, looks like.  Oh, late 70s!  Okay.  People already gearing up for the video camcorders and stuff.  And now you got it on your cell phone.  Done.  Yeah.  But does it creep you out all that the late 70s was over 30 years ago?  Yeah, I know.  You think that.  It's like, what the fuck happened? 
[03:07:00]  I was 16, 17.  Where'd that go?  What the fuck, man?  We said the 70s was the greatest decade.  Jimmy, what's...  I'm chilly, Ope.  I'm drinking a goddamn cool thing.  And I remember thinking, like, the year 2000 was going to be some fucking amazing, futuristic  bullshit thing.  In the 70s, I was thinking, holy shit.  Yeah.  Now, the year 2000 is going to be amazing.  Space and fucking...  We're going to mile our suits.  We're going to be flying around in cars.  We're going to be flying around like the fucking guy checking on women putting their frozen 
[03:07:30]  food in baggies.  Is that commercial?  What the fuck was it?  I thought...  Remember the guy with a jet pack?  Yeah.  Checking in.  Yeah.  He had a jet pack and he'd come...  Make sure you're keeping things fresh and you ziplock back.  I thought we'd wake up in the year 2000, the first day, and there'd be a big, like, news  bulletin where to drop off your car and get your flying car.  Yeah.  Like, it was like, okay, we're just waiting until the year 2000 and then you get to, you  know, drop your car off.  And get the brand new unbelievable car.  We got more conveniences.  I think we didn't see... 
[03:08:00]  We saw...  I think we thought it was going to be a lot more mechanical advances than computer advances.  It is all computer.  It's all computer and electronics now.  The car is still an internal combustion fucking engine.  Right.  It looks better, but it's still...  You fucking put gas in it and you drive and there's telephone poles and there's just  that.  But you have your nav systems.  You got your computerized crap in there.  Your phones with the cameras and everything else.  That's pretty much...  We didn't see that coming, but... 
[03:08:30]  And I'm going to die by the hands of a fucking iPod in my car.  That was designed to paralyze you.  They might as well put a picture of somebody with a feed tube in their fucking...  I mean, I've come this close to hitting the fucking wall on the sawmill parkway.  Every night that I drive into the cellar, I'm scrolling through my playlist looking for  fucking air supply.  Looking for that inspirational song to get you ready for your set.  Yes!  And I fucking look up.  I'm a cunt here away from the...  Whoa!  If they ever fucking came up with something more dangerous than driving and talking on 
[03:09:00]  a cell phone...  Yeah, it's sad!  It's driving and texting.  Fucking scrolling through a list!  Scroll through a list.  Because now you're reading and you're looking down.  You're doing everything you're not supposed to do.  I don't need to look out the window.  And when you start thinking about, like, I'm doing fucking 70 miles an hour.  Yes!  This thing is hurtling with no eyes.  It's now an unguided bomb.  And I'm trying to find a comma button.  Yeah, fucking...  Yeah.  I don't want to...  And, you know, you look up and somebody's in a dead standstill 50 feet ahead of you. 
[03:09:30]  How's that going to end?  And it feels so natural, too, because I was just driving and went up to the mountains  over the weekend and all of a sudden my girl's like, what are you doing?  And I'm driving 70, 75 miles an hour.  I'm like, I'm emailing Kenny.  What's your problem?  Like, just a fucking...  You're staring with, like, your index finger.  You don't even think twice about it.  Like, what?  I'm just emailing Kenny.  Picture years ago.  Picture years ago, your dad in the car, and as he's driving, he's typing a letter next  to him with a big fucking old typewriter. 
[03:10:00]  Chick, chick, chick, chick, chick, chick, chick, ding, chick, chick, chick, and driving down  the street.  You'd be going, what the fuck are you doing?  That's exactly what you're doing.  That's what...  It's the fucking...  And people are dying every day because of that shit.  Every day.  Every day.  Those girls upstate about...  Yep.  Eight months of them or something.  Swerved.  And it was right...  They had the proof that she was on her fucking lap.  Yeah, in the middle of a text.  What was she writing?  Wham.  Who was that?  I don't know.  Writing I Miss You or something.  Because it's all mundane crap anyway.  You're right.  Hopefully it was something like, I can't wait to suck that big black and then you just 
[03:10:30]  hear...  Oh.  Ouch.  What about a naughty...  You know, I thought by the year 2000...  LOL.  Lost our legs.  Yeah.  R-A-L-L.  Rolling all over freeway.  It is made for that shit.  It really is.  And I can't believe...  And I tell my wife about it.  I remember reading going...  I read something in the paper.  It's like, yeah, seven out of ten accidents are caused by... 
[03:11:00]  The next day she gets me like a fucking thing I can plug into the...  I'm like...  Yeah.  Yeah.  The hands free.  Yep.  Yep.  I thought by the year 2000 we would figure out the whole like driving...  When you're driving down the highway and another car is coming at you.  Yeah.  I thought they would have figured that out by now.  Like maybe make two separate fucking lanes.  That it's impossible to get into a head-on collision in this day and age.  Why am I trusting not one or two, but hundreds and hundreds of other drivers as I speed by  them as they're going the other way?  Yeah. 
[03:11:30]  You're trusting...  Why can't we figure that shit out?  None of these cars bump together.  Yeah.  And they're not on tracks.  You know, if...  Back in the day, if you saw one car coming at you, you'd be...  You'd be freaked out.  But now we don't even...  We take it for granted.  There's just...  You're just assuming they're going to do the right thing and they're not on their fucking  iPods.  That's right.  That's how Kinnison died.  Yeah.  Yep.  Guy swerved into his fucking lane in his pickup truck.  Yep.  Wham.  For that fucking day.  And then bragged about it.  What do you mean bragged about it?  He bragged...  Yeah.  That he was the guy that killed Sam Kinnison. 
[03:12:00]  It's on his resume.  He used to go around saying, yeah, it was the guy that killed Kinnison.  He used to like walk around...  Was he bragging about it?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, we could get his brother on.  He'll tell you the whole story.  We've had Sam's brother on a few times.  All right, here's another commercial for another product that failed miserably.  Meet the lady.  Her name is Lisa.  And she's the most exciting thing to happen in computers today.  The lady Lisa. 
[03:12:30]  Beautiful.  A classic triumph for Apple.  Pure and simple graphic images and a clever pointing device called a mouse.  But most importantly, unlimited expandability.  Unlimited power.  Lisa from Apple.  The user today at Wallace Micromart.  Ah, is that a computer?  Yes, from Apple.  You remember the...  Ah.  It was called the Apple Lisa?  Yeah.  Isn't she beautiful, huh?  Lisa.  That thing is stupid.  What an ugly fucking machine. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is that a portable?  But see, back then it wasn't about something looking good.  82.  That's right.  It was about, you know what.  That's right.  Let's see what it's got.  It's got 5.25 inch twiggy floppy drives.  That's nice.  All right.  It was supposed to be the, like, Mac pretty much killed it.  I mean, yeah, the Apple Mac killed this.  Some support for up to two megabytes of RAM?  Really?  Wow.  Two meg...  What do you store on that one letter? 
[03:13:30]  Dear Frank, I need a new computer.  High five me, someone.  I'll give you an air one.  All right.  Across the table.  It had a 5 megahertz processor.  Oh, my...  You know, someone is still waiting for a response.  They sent something at 82, and it's still downloading.  5 megahertz.  On his Lisa.  Is that good, Jimmy?  And it only takes up half your bedroom.  Yes.  Like the ENIAC. 
[03:14:00]  It's like a fucking refrigerator with a TV screen in a fucking package from FedEx on  top of it.  You got to kick your twin brother out of your room so you can have a computer.  Oh, wait.  Steve Jobs was forced...  God, this fucking LASIK works.  I can read that from here.  Wow.  Steve Jobs was forced out of the Lisa project, so he joined the Macintosh project instead.  Contrary to popular belief, the Macintosh is not a direct descendant of the Lisa, although  there are obvious similarities between the systems and the final revision.  And the Lisa 210 was modified and sold as the Macintosh. 
[03:14:30]  Oh.  I can't believe I could see that from here.  Lisa 210.  That was my girlfriend's nickname.  And I just go...  What?  You ready to move on to the next one?  Yeah.  I can read from here.  I got 22,000.  That's right.  Can we...  The next one?  Whatever you need read.  Oh, I'll read it.  Well, no.  Need something read?  I'll read.  That's why we played the audio, so it's less reading for us.  Oh.  We figured that one out, fuck, two, three years ago. 
[03:15:00]  Arch Deluxe.  Do you remember this product?  Not by name.  See you press L.  Do you L might stand for lobby?  But for me, Chef Andrew.  L stands for lettuce.  Crisp iceberg lettuce.  Just one of the ingredients of McDonald's Arch Deluxe.  America's favorite new burger.  I just can't help myself.  I love it.  Then what was the problem with a burger?  Yeah, it was a burger with lettuce and tomato.  They fucking that...  Isn't that what your Arch Deluxe was?  Seriously.  Do you know, Thad, why did this product fail?  I'm looking at a picture of it right now.  Because it had been around.  Biggest product failures ever. 
[03:15:30]  The Arch Deluxe.  What was wrong with it?  Because it was trying to compete with the Whopper.  I know why.  They put avocado on it.  Avocado.  Avocado.  It was just like a burger.  Before it was popular.  Yeah, it was a burger.  They were trying to compete with lettuce and tomato.  Yeah, they were trying to do the fucking Whopper thing.  But they didn't have that, so they used octopus cum.  Yeah.  And they thought it would take off.  Is that the special sauce?  Nothing more delicious than a warm tomato on a burger.  Fucking stupid.  Is that the only thing? 
[03:16:00]  Dumb tomatoes and lettuce?  It really was.  They put it in a nice box.  You can see what...  It's got...  Yeah, a bun, secret sauce.  Yeah.  Onions, lettuce, tomato, beef.  Somebody was working overtime.  American cheese.  Wow.  But wasn't this the McDLT?  See, I'm confusing others.  That shows your marketing.  They just rename shit and sell it again.  Remember the McDLT?  It was the burger on one side, and then the lettuce and tomato on the other.  You're right.  And it was in some big styrofoam box.  It was homeless people living in their mouth. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah.  If one of these things would ruin the environment, you'd throw it out.  Yeah, that's what ruined the fucking...  Yeah.  The ozone.  I blame the ancestors again.  I forgot about that.  It was also...  We've been attacking the ancestors all morning long there, Nick.  Yeah, I heard you.  I was laughing.  Yeah, you were part of it.  You got in on that.  Power windows.  Who would have come up on that?  It was also, I guess, very expensive.  Oh, is that the problem?  Pickles are going through the roof in 86.  Fucking...  Yeah.  McDonald's spent $300 on research, production, and marketing for the Arch Deluxe. 
[03:17:00]  How much?  $300 million.  Oh, $300 million.  That guy's working at a car wash in Seattle now.  Look at this.  Yeah, I was the guy.  I used to be some...  Shut up.  It's a bad name.  Give me a bad name for a product.  Arch Deluxe.  Arch Deluxe.  Yeah, it sounds like a guy's name.  They should just call it...  Coach Arch Deluxe.  That's right.  Went 7-0 this year on the SEC.  They should just call it the Chopper or something.  I mean, they ripped it off the Whopper.  Just changed the first letter.  How about the unoriginal burger?  Yeah, right.  Which...  That's right.  How about the Hoo-Hoo Burger?  That's right.  How about the cunt on a bun? 
[03:17:30]  It sounds crazy to us, but...  It sounds crazy?  That's right.  That's fantastic.  Think of word of mouth.  I mean, come on.  That's right.  I'm doing a bun.  Can I have some cow-asshole cooking?  Why not?  Let's go to McDonald's.  I haven't eaten cuntin'.  Do it.  All right.  We're going to go to the next product.  I got a funny joke, too.  The Chicken McNuggets.  I'm like, what?  I don't know chickens have nuggets.  I give the crowd a look like we all know where I'm going with this.  You know, it's all how you look at them.  I got a fucking Cialis rod right now.  You're looking at him like Ronnie Gold. 
[03:18:00]  You want to see his Cialis hard on, Nick?  He likes to show people.  It just happens sometimes.  I'm looking at something on Paddle Talk.  You say Cialis?  You can't say Cialis.  Oh, tomato, tomato.  It all equals this.  He's just the worst.  I just knocked over my fucking...  Oh, my God.  See that?  Oh, I just knocked over my fucking goddamn juice.  It's like a bad ad for Cialis.  You're just the worst.  Oh, special times.  Yeah, I knocked it over with my hard cock. 
[03:18:30]  That's a great ad for Cialis.  I fucking knocked over my juice.  You're going to pull a China Syndrome.  I can still drink it.  All right, let's go to the next one.  You ready here?  Tampons.  Man, you all right?  Oh, fantastic.  All right, here's the next product failure.  Now, this one we all know.  Finally.  If you think network television is a little boring, start your own network.  With a Sony Betamax and a portable Sony videotape camera, you can do just that.  You can record what you want, when you want, and watch what you want, when you want. 
[03:19:00]  It's the best family entertainment on television.  One more shot, Ma.  Come on, smile.  This is the best birthday I've ever had.  Oof.  Oh, my God.  Fucking whining old bitty.  Oh, my God.  He walked in while she was sleeping with, like, the Mexican gardener, and she popped up, and  his dick was in, like, come on, Ma, smile.  And he ruined her good birthday, and that's why she was crying.  Fucking blubbering idiot, Ma.  Lighten up.  It's a camera. 
[03:19:30]  Fucking data.  Hey, Ma, it's a Polaroid.  Take a picture of your clit and give it to Dad.  Jesus Christ.  Fluff it up.  Wow, this is, we love our Canadian callers.  Hunter, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Good evening.  Yeah, McDonald's had pizza, like, six, seven years ago in Canada.  I don't know if he had it there in the States.  They did.  But it was pretty awful.  Yeah.  Pizza McDonald's?  Yeah, it was called, like, McPizza. 
[03:20:00]  Seriously?  Yeah.  Fucking, we're like, no.  We're like, boy, that must have went away in a week.  Does that lead to any pizza?  Yeah, we're not McDiggin' that.  So, it was a big McFlop.  And McSucks.  I know.  Fucking remember that.  And I love pizza.  I don't give a shit what kind of.  Me too.  You give me a piece of pizza, I'm happy.  Yeah, baby.  What do we know about the Betamax?  Just, it was just.  It was legendary.  Yeah, legendary failure.  Yeah.  Flop.  Beta tape. 
[03:20:30]  Didn't quite catch on.  Yeah, why?  How come it was outdone by the other version?  VHS.  People liked it better.  I don't know why.  And the VHS was bigger.  It was bigger, yeah.  Which was so dumb about it.  And the Beta was on a loop, I believe.  It was almost like a cart.  Like, it was on a loop.  I put Frody Grant into that, too.  Damn it.  You guys need anything red?  I was picked the wrong one.  What?  You guys need anything red?  No, we don't, Eagle Eye.  I can see it now.  I can't read across the room.  But I had bad eyes for many years, Nick. 
[03:21:00]  Well, that's going to surprise me when you're having Korean pee in your fucking retina.  Read Steve's sexuality.  What?  I can read that, too.  I have fucking, I have better vision.  I don't have x-ray vision.  Wow.  Sony produced a scaled-down version.  I just took the wind down on my own sails.  As the sails go, I was just sailing along.  Just flap and flutter down.  And they just flopped down limply.  I saw that last joke.  It wasn't even a swing and a miss.  The bat was limp. 
[03:21:30]  I swung a fucking wet spaghetti noodle.  I didn't help with the setup, that's for sure.  You're adrift with the tide.  No, you didn't.  Can you see Steve's sexuality?  Go.  Yeah, that was horrendous on my part.  Let's go to the next product failure.  Suck this cock.  This one everyone knows.  This was just a dumb, dumb idea.  I will now predict the exact moment in time when every single one of you will enjoy the  best-tasting Coca-Cola ever.  It will be the very moment that you pick up this can, because inside this can is the 
[03:22:00]  new taste of Coca-Cola.  The best-tasting Coca-Cola ever.  You will taste the new taste immediately, and you will like it a lot.  Now, if you're a Coke drinker, wait until you taste this one.  If you're a Pepsi drinker, well, I predict we're going to be real friendly from here on  in for a long, long time.  Yeah, the new Coke.  It was called Coca-Cola Jew.  New Coke.  Yeah, it was a big failure.  They say it's probably the biggest failure ever by a big company.  They also say it was kind of calculated that they wanted to put out a new Coke that sucked 
[03:22:30]  and then bring back the old Coke under a brand new classic Coke thing to really, like, pump  that up.  That's pretty fucking brave, man.  Take that chance.  It is.  But it's Coke.  So how brave could it be?  People are going to fucking buy it.  What was the deal?  Pepsi was starting to take over, and Coke's numbers weren't that bad, and then they decided  we got it.  I'm doing that with my career right now.  I'm doing a lot of shitty comedy.  That's how fucking funny I was in the 80s. 
[03:23:00]  Make it seem better.  Yeah.  So you're going to be doing shitty comedy at the Brigade.  No, no.  Nothing but the best at the Brigade.  End of the bitch.  End of the bitch.  Yeah, really.  Look at me, backpedaling like a bitch.  I don't give a shit.  You want to see bad comedy?  Yeah.  Yes, Jimmy.  This Friday, Saturday, Sunday, if you're on the West Coast, you check out Cobbs and  Sandy Franny.  There's going to be no laughs to be had whatsoever.  Not a one.  I'm going to bomb my face off.  Who doesn't want to see that? 
[03:23:30]  Horribly.  The boys are starting a new bit.  Now they're telling us, well, it's Lady Trucker.  She's officially started the bit.  Hi, fellas.  This is a 65 mile an hour feedback.  She's going 65 mile an hour.  She's typing you.  When will Black Phil be on the radio again?  What the fuck is Black Phil?  Was it this past Saturday or this coming Saturday?  Patrice O'Neill does a show here on Saturday nights every once in a while called Black Phil.  I think it's good.  It didn't just pass, right?  I think it's maybe this Saturday. 
[03:24:00]  What?  It did just pass?  Danny?  Danny's just...  April 5th is the next show.  April 5th.  Okay.  Tune in.  All right.  The next product failure.  PC Junior.  A bright little addition to the family.  Junior comes with bright computer ideas, like a keyboard that doesn't need a cord.  You can get easy to use software like word processing, games and graphics your kids won't believe, plus a starting price you won't believe. 
[03:24:30]  And with easy to add options, Junior can grow up real fast.  PC Junior, new from IBM.  Thank you, Kitty Carlisle.  What the fuck?  Got a 90-year-old lady pushing your product?  That might have been the first step in the...  Yeah, try to unplug your keyboard.  What was the problem with the PC Junior?  It was expensive.  It was trying to compete, and they wanted $4 million for it.  Failure in the marketplace.  Failure in the marketplace.  Why did it fail?  It says at $669, the PC Junior's price was not competitive. 
[03:25:00]  Why would you buy the Junior when fucking Senior was available?  Obviously, he had much more fucking wisdom and memory.  Experience.  Experience.  Yeah, it was twice as much as the Commodore 64 and the Atari 8-bit family.  Eh.  Hmm.  Too much money.  Let's say hi to Ben in Georgia.  Ben.  Going into the computer business.  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  Big fan of the show.  I just wanted to point out, I heard that the reason why Beta did not survive was that 
[03:25:30]  the porn industry actually embraced VHS.  Wow.  We're over the edge.  Fucking great point.  Great point.  Really?  You might be right, man.  Yeah.  Can you imagine that?  I have no idea where I heard that from.  What else would you need to watch at home alone?  Pornography.  So whatever, like, that was probably the first take-home videos, because you could watch movies.  Well, I don't know.  I had a lot of nice home movies in my family, having picnics and playing football.  Oh, but Nick, you know Nick, you're next to God's ears.  My sister's wedding.  I kind of like that. 
[03:26:00]  Jerking off to my nieces.  You like my living in that?  That's it.  You guys have always mentioned that pornography is what pushes technology forward.  That's true.  It's got to be true.  It's absolutely true.  I had a great video of me, and I was doing a cookout, and I had a fucking thing that said  Mom is a little helper, and I threw my wife in the pool, and we laughed.  My brother got married on a roof.  I know what you're talking about.  Of course you do.  Of course I do.  All right.  Let's say hi to Josh in New Mexico.  Josh.  I don't want him to fuck me.  Hey, I think 15 years ago, Pepsi made a Pepsi Clear or Crystal Pepsi, something like that. 
[03:26:30]  I don't remember, because...  Pepsi Clear, yes.  That's all I got.  Punch it out.  Pepsi...  Oh, by the way...  It sounds too much like Pepsi Clear stuff.  Snopes is saying that New Coke theory you had, Ant, is like BS.  Well, how do they know?  Because he drives a truck.  How does Snopes know?  Because it's like...  And Bill K. from Philly, hey, hope that porn story is an urban legend as well.  Boy, I guess we're spreading all kinds of disinformation here and there.  That's not an urban legend.  Fuck us. 
[03:27:00]  What were the first videos?  They were porn videos as far as the biggest sellers.  The biggest seller in the market.  That's not bullshit.  Okay.  And I want to say hi to Timothy McCoy.  He's going 78 miles per hour, feedbacking in the fog, and he just wanted to say hi.  70,000 tons of fucking Idaho potatoes in his truck.  Right.  Got a fucking lady in front of him and a Cooper.  All right, let's move on to the next product here.  The DeLorean.  Gullwing doors rise effortlessly, beckoning you inside. 
[03:27:30]  The sleek, stainless steel DeLorean.  Beautifully crafted for long life.  The DeLorean is one of the most awaited automobiles in automotive history.  Drive the DeLorean.  Live the dream today.  I'm guessing it was the music in the commercial that buried that fucking...  And the...  What's a bird? 
[03:28:00]  Yeah, what the fuck is that?  That's DeLorean, snot and coke.  Dirty ass.  He had a nose whistle.  A little rock of coke in his nose.  Try the DeLorean.  What's the reason why that this thing fell?  They give a reason?  The price?  No, DeLorean fucking fucked it up.  Yeah, remember the undercover sting?  Yeah.  Right?  He was pumping some cars out. 
[03:28:30]  It was, you know, doing all right.  And then he got busted.  Selling coke.  Remember the suitcase with money in it?  Oh, yeah.  It was all kinds of great shit.  He fucked up.  How fucking old are we?  Is he still in jail or no?  DeLorean's still in jail?  I don't know.  He's probably dead.  And finally, we got the last one here.  Ugh, what the fuck?  They'll know you've arrived.  When you drive up in the 1958 Edsel, 
[03:29:00]  the car that's truly new from nameplate to taillights.  New from the front.  New from the side.  New from the rear.  Wow.  Only Edsel has the sleek, clean line design  that sets it apart from the look-alike cars.  And it combines new looks  with the newest V8 engines in the world.  The big new Edsel 400 
[03:29:30]  and the power-packed Edsel 475.  It is unlikely you have ever driven a car  with so much real, usable power as the Edsel.  The Edsel.  And with Edsel's exclusive Teletouch drive,  you drive more safely, more easily  than you ever have before.  Because both hands can stay at the wheel  while the Edsel shifts electrically.  There's even the added luxury  of new Edsel air suspension.  That's just like riding on air. 
[03:30:00]  Because you are.  Nice music.  How about lying?  And remember, the honeymooners.  All the medium-priced cars are carny.  Killing the grave!  The 1958 Edsel is the one that's new  and the lowest price, too.  How long were these commercials?  Oh my God.  Enough about the Edsel.  We get it.  And the best part is,  it has electric windows.  You can roll up when Negroes are by.  The big heavy grill is good 
[03:30:30]  if Negroes get in your way.  Because you know what they're here to do  probably rob you  and rape your lovely wife and children.  That's what the German Shepherds  and Fire Hoses are for.  What year is this?  1958.  Yes, 58.  The 58 Edsel.  Wonderful.  We've even tried to cover up  the blackness of the tires  with white walls.  Because you know, 
[03:31:00]  we don't want anything black on this car.  Pull into your garage  and close the door behind you  to keep the Negroes away.  Oh, the 50s.  What are you going to do?  Yeah, that's the guy.  Very intolerant.  That's that voice.  Yeah, he just always had that whole thing.  It's the same guy  that did the little films  for the kids in school  on how to hide under your desk  when they were fucking nuclear bombs. 
[03:31:30]  Oh, the ducking cover.  That's right, Johnny.  Duck and cover.  That's him.  When the communist menace  drops its hydrogen bombs on you  so you don't burn to a crisp,  duck and cover, Johnny.  Good boy.  Hide under a piece of quarter of time.  Yes, that will save you.  Some people say  radiation is dangerous.  Poppycock.  Your hair might fall out,  but it'll grow back.  Same length, same color,  same cowlick.  Don't worry about that, kids. 
[03:32:00]  Your government's here  to protect you  from the commie menace  and the negro.  So light up a lucky strike.  Yes, you, pregnant woman,  have a drink  and a lucky  good for your baby.  Unfiltered.  Yes.  And let the doctor  inject you  with some thalidomide.  It's good for your children.  He'll be a hell of a swimmer  with those flippers. 
[03:32:30]  Save on yarn.  Sweaters have never been  so cheap  for grandma's in it.  That's right,  one armhole.  Oh, my stomach.  It's fucking killing me.  Holy shit,  that was good.  Coming down the red carpet,  it's Tracy and Hepburn.  Wonderful,  look at the couple. 
[03:33:00]  Uh-oh,  please look out  at Negro.  Oh, it's Sidney Poitier.  Sorry, Sidney.  Ah, what a time.  Yeah, they seemed  to get the same guy  for everything.  He was in war films  in the 40s  and the 50s,  educational things  and all the shit.  Filmstrip records  when I was a kid.  Beep.  He's got that crew cut  and those  harm Janine Graffler glasses. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah, always in a suit.  Yeah, skinny black tie.  Win that  Edward R. Murrow award.  DeLorean died in 2005.  Of what?  I think it was cancer.  One of his doors  in his car  hit him under the chin.  Took his head off.  I think it was a stroke, yeah.  We're doing...  Oh, really?  Line of the day.  Cokehead died of a stroke?  Go figure that one out.  Oopsie.  We've got to do  Line of the Day  because we've got to go...  Wow, look at the time.  We've got to go back  to the other joint  and meet the new boss  same as the old boss.  The old boss.  You know what?  Who is he? 
[03:34:00]  New boss.  Put a word in.  Well, this time around  it's going to be abroad.  Oh, Jesus.  She's a good one  for each other, I think.  Yeah, that's good  for political correctness.  I'm sure she'll loosen right up.  Fucking A.  Seriously.  And she also runs  the nice station in town.  Fresh.  And what's her name?  Fresh.  I hear she's lovely.  So we're going to meet her today.  So we've got to get out of here.  SkiColoradoNow.com  for info and great deals  on 26 world-class resorts.  Up to the minute snow conditions. 
[03:34:30]  Log on to SkiColoradoNow.com.  One runner up?  What happens all the...  There's plenty,  but if you want to give us  60 more seconds,  we can give you more runners up.  The voting is happening  as we speak.  Oh, my gosh.  The tension is crazy around here.  Yeah.  It's like the primaries.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's happening?  There's lots.  All right.  Well, it's...  Bushels.  There's a bevy.  A bevy?  Paul McCartney's holding up well, huh? 
[03:35:00]  Oh.  Holy shit.  His face is melting like a candle.  He's 60-what now?  Five, six?  Did he make the famous 65?  Yeah, so spend a buck  a couple of years ago.  Cut off that fucking...  I'm looking at my fucking  fat stomach over my belt,  and I want to just grab it  with garden shears  and cut it off.  You can do that.  Affection might set in.  If you take a razor blade  and blow it  and let it bleed out  a little bit,  you get thinner.  Can I eat even a piece  of fucking cake  without just mushing up  into a flesh bell? 
[03:35:30]  Flesh bell.  No.  We're older now.  We can't do that.  That's for the young Jimmy.  The young kiddie,  whatever they want.  All right.  Are we ready?  Because now we're just  talking about Jimmy's belly.  Jimmy's belly.  So there's three runners up.  All right.  Let's do a runner-up line  of the day here.  It better be Nick DiPaolo.  What a weirdo.  She said she would  check on him every 20 minutes.  He would just hang there  alone in the room  for hours.  Roast for hours.  She would be a roast. 
[03:36:00]  She used to check on him.  I'll baste you  every 20 minutes.  Just set it  and forget it.  Nick DiPaolo  at Bergada.  The Bergada.  Atlantic City.  Saturday night.  Here's another  runner-up line of the day.  I hope they find him  dead in the grotto.  Just floating.  With just hair  with blood  in the follicles  in his hand. 
[03:36:30]  Big A.  And one of F's girls  missing.  Just some girl  sobbing  with a piece of her scalp  torn out.  What a horrific scene  you painted there.  You know what it was?  Big A with a big clump  of bloody scalp  and some woman crying.  He'd be petting her hair  and then she'd go  I gotta go  and he would just go  and you would panic  and rip a piece  of her scalp off  and not even mean to it.  He'd just be sitting there  with an erection  tanking in his awful  filthy crusted pants. 
[03:37:00]  In the grotto  she's feeling the sting  of chlorinated water  on her fucking  exposed skull.  She's got like fucking  she's got four inches  of almost brain matter  showing while he's  sitting there  with clear stuff  in his fucking  fat boy pants.  Her career is ruined.  Can I do this shoot  with a hat on him?  Again with the hat?  Jason Voorhees head.  It just fucking  it'll never grow back  because he did such  damage to the scalp.  He tore like below  where the follicles grow in. 
[03:37:30]  Those fucking  awful little  little implants  to her fucking  cock teasing head.  Good for you big A.  Get one of your tits  off while you're riding.  Fucking snotty bitch.  It'll be in studio Friday  to talk about  his Playboy Mansion  experience.  I can't wait.  Here's another  runner up line of the day.  Those girls upstate  about five of them  or something.  And it was right  they had the proof  that she was on 
[03:38:00]  in the middle  of a text.  What was she writing?  Wham.  What was that?  I don't know.  Writing I Miss You  or something.  Because it's all  mundane crap anyway.  Hopefully it was  something like  I can't wait to  suck that big black  and then you just  get like  what about the naughty?  You know  I thought  by the year 2000  LOL  lost our legs.  R-A-L-F  rolling all over  freeway.  Can I stop  clearing my throat  on the air? 
[03:38:30]  I fucking do  I can't stop doing it.  I don't mean to do it.  I apologize to the listeners.  I didn't notice.  Are you?  Fucking awful.  Flemmy.  Yeah.  I need to stop it  and be a professional.  Sean Hannity's not  going to appreciate that.  No.  He's not professional.  He's probably right now.  Sean's a weirdo.  Here's your line  of the day.  I was trying to catch 
[03:39:00]  a baseball  and I was such a girl  that it shot right  there was a pop fly  and it went right  past my glove  and bounced off my face.  Did it go  make that sound  that three stooges  knock sound?  It split my head  and I lifted my hat  and blood rushed  down my face  so I walked home  and I'm laying  on my bathroom floor  and the ambulance came  and I was like  a little woozy  so they're putting me  on the stretcher  and I said to the people  pray for me. 
[03:39:30]  And that's how  you executive produce.  I love that story, Jimmy.  I completely forgot  about that  until Nick said  It's so bad.  Nick said something  that made me remind me  of it and it just  what a fucking  just what a melodramatic  little tool.  What a suburban tool.  We had fun today  but tomorrow's the day.  Tomorrow we look at  your first TV appearance  from 11 years ago.  It's fucking humiliating.  We're bringing in  a lot of guys for it too.  Who's coming in?  Nick, if you want to come back 
[03:40:00]  you're more than welcome.  What time?  When?  We're just going to beat up  Jimmy all day tomorrow.  Who's coming in?  Who do we got?  We have Patrice,  Bob Kelly,  and Voss so far.  Nick Dapal is going to be  at the Bregada  Saturday night.  Nick, I don't want to  put you on the spot  but I'm just going to  throw the offer out there.  You can say no.  What?  This channel is live  until noon  if you want to do an hour  or just fuck around.  Really?  We'll give you a phone screener 
[03:40:30]  and everything.  Sure, why not?  Really?  Yeah.  Alright, cool.  Alright, Nick Dapal is going  to keep the channel live  until Ron and Fez at noon.  And Nick will be  at the Bregada  and I'm going to  just plug my thing  like a whore.  San Francisco this weekend.  Ticket's going fast.  I just got a call.  They said,  almost sold out.  There's only two left.  So,  at Cobb's Comedy Club  and Nick will be  on the air here  for a little while.  Taking calls.  Will I?  Yeah,  but throw a subject  out there  so you're all prepared. 
[03:41:00]  NickDip.com  How's that for a subject?  Blog Talk Road.  We covered everything,  didn't we?  I'm trying to...  You'll do fine.  What angle do you want to take?  You want to do some politics?  You don't have to do it  but it's a nice opportunity.  The channel's live.  Yeah, absolutely.  Good amount of people listening.  You want to do politics?  What's on your mind?  What do you want to do?  A little theme?  Let's talk politics.  And current events?  Yeah, and current events.  I think that's...  That's good.  I think...  Why not? 
[03:41:30]  And the Negro.  I'm punchy already.  Nick does great radio, man.  I was a big fan  when he was working  at the other place with us  and he got fucked  in that whole  we don't know what the fuck  we're doing way.  My timing was impeccable  once again.  Fuck.  Stepped into that...  Actually, Nick was starting  to get a buzz and everything  and then they decided  to go back to a rock station.  Exactly.  Which is now a rock station  that you program as a listener  which is going to turn  into something else next week.  For a whole week,  you the listener 
[03:42:00]  can program it.  For the whole week,  you the listener  can program it.  Wow.  You can't hear Molly Hatchett  anyway, right?  Taking a chance  by letting the listeners  program it for a week.  That's called  letting the inmates  run the asylum.  That's right, Jim.  And we'll go back  to the same  five Red Hot Chili Peppers  songs next week.  I like Californication.  I could listen to that  over and over.  You have.  Yeah.  We all have.  All right.  Give it away.  Give it away.  Right.  Nick DePaul is going  to get us to noon.  Yeah, baby.  I'm taking you to noon.  Thank you, fellas. 
[03:42:30]  All right.  For having me  and for giving this  the opportunity  to ruin everything I just did.  You know what?  I'm fucking fired up, man.  Here's the deal, too.  If you're not feeling it.  I'm feeling it.  I ain't going nowhere.  No, no, no.  Fuck it.  You could bail.  Just go, I'll be back  with more and then just leave  and then they'll put  a best of bid on it.  No way.  I'm not going anywhere.  All right, good.  Nick's going to go to noon.  So give him a call, please.  The phone number's right there.  866-WOW-WOW.  866-WOW-WOW?  Huh?  Wow, one wow.  Wow, one wow.  Oh, Jesus.  Give him the wrong number.  Holy shit.  It's going to get quiet in here. 
[03:43:00]  No, it's on their unit.  They know how to call this show.  Oh, I forgot this is silly.  Yeah.  So say fuck a lot.  That omelet's hanging  on my stomach  like a fucking fetus.  I'll tell you.  Jesus Christ.  Who made that thing?  Fucking ankle weights in it.  Fast Freddy wants to talk  about Britney,  so I hope you have  some good Britney.  All right, Fast Freddy.  Let's talk about that.  Don't fuck that crazy bitch.  I'm pissed that we have  to go to a meeting.  I want to hear Nick  do his thing now.  I'm sure they'll record it.  All right, the phone calls  are coming in.  Quick break, 
[03:43:30]  and Nick DiPaolo  will continue.  Thanks, guys.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Home invasions  are a serious matter.  That's why your local  law enforcement  decided to put  this video together.  Home security strategies  with Anthony Cumia  will instruct you  on how to protect  your loved ones  and, more importantly,  your valuables.  This week's episode is  Defending a Single Point Entry.  Your best defense  is having a situation  where they all have  to come through  one place. 
[03:44:00]  You guys see the 300?  If you get a home invasion  and they got to come through  a door or a window,  you got to keep stuff  secure enough  where it's going to take  them a little while  to get in.  And then when you hear  that commotion,  grab your weaponry.  Take up a position.  That door flies open.  Bam, they're all  right in your sights.  We hope you've learned  a lot from today's video.  For more information  on home invasions  or other videos,
