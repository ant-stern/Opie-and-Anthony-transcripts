<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a discussion about the New York Jets' acquisition of Tim Tebow, eliciting strongly negative reactions ("fucking retarded," "this fucking thing sucks a dick") from the hosts and many callers, although some surprisingly supported the move.  The hosts speculated on the impact on Mark Sanchez, predicted the enthusiastic ("Tebow! Tebow!") fan response, and discussed Joe Namath's incoherent, kiss-filled reaction to the trade (a clip of which was played).  The conversation also touched upon the New York Knicks, creating a joke about "Tim Sanity" mirroring "Lynn Sanity," and the NFL's bounty scandal,  viewed as a distraction from concussion lawsuits.  This segment included reminiscing about old photos of a younger Travis and featured Kevin Smith as a guest.

Smith, in studio, discussed his emotional responses to hockey documentaries while high, detailing his crying fits. He enthusiastically reviewed his multiple viewings of the Broadway show *Book of Mormon*, praising its humor, technical aspects, and cast (including Andrew Rannells, Josh Gad, and Michael Potts). He also promoted his new book, *Tough Shit*, describing it as a memoir/advice book covering the last five years of his life, with anecdotes about Bruce Willis and Southwest Airlines.  A caller discussed Smith's film *Coon* and Lee Tergesen's acting. The conversation briefly touched upon *Glenn Gary, Glenn Ross* and the interpretation of Shelley Levine.

Following this, the show addressed a Los Angeles city council's attempt to regulate offensive language on the radio, with the hosts strongly criticizing it as an attack on free speech, citing hypocrisy in targeting certain offensive language while ignoring others, particularly in rap music.  The Trayvon Martin case and the media's coverage were also discussed, with concerns raised about racial bias and selective reporting, fueled by a caller mentioning Zimmerman's use of a racial slur.  The discussion explored complexities of race relations and media representation in America.

A subsequent segment delved further into race and media representation of crime, highlighting perceived biases in reporting black-on-white versus white-on-black crimes.  The hosts discussed white guilt and privilege and their influence on media reporting and societal perceptions.  Caller Jay, a Black man, agreed with the hosts' observations about media bias and the lack of attention given to black-on-black crime.  Another caller, Steve, discussed gun permit acquisition in Pennsylvania versus New York, which led to a lengthy, vulgar discussion about sex, pornography, and bodily functions.  Bob Kelly was a guest during part of this segment, and the hosts referenced Louis C.K. and Patrice O'Neal's comedic takes on race.

Another segment returned to the Tim Tebow acquisition, with Jim Florentine as a caller, predicting significant fan reaction and on-field drama.  The hosts called Jets fans "assholes" and discussed the owner being labelled a liar.  The NFL's bounty scandal was again discussed. This segment involved significant off-color humor and personal anecdotes, including a story from Florentine about semen on his roommate's neck. The conversation included graphic descriptions of sexual acts.  Bob Kelly was in studio, and a "Primetime Sam Roberts and one question" segment interviewed DMC of Run-D.M.C. about his television habits.  The show featured a lengthy discussion about guns, punctuated by vulgar jokes, and chaotic interactions involving a cake and cupcakes. The show concluded with plugs for the comediansâ€™ upcoming performances.  Throughout the entire broadcast, highly offensive language and graphic descriptions were frequent.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  It makes me laugh every time we play that.  Shatner's 81 today, by the way.  Oh.  Good old William Shatner.  Friend of the show, I think.  Hello, Bill.  Hello, Bill.  I call him Bill.  Yeah.  And now I annoy him on his Twitters, on his tweets, too.  Because anything he tweets, I bring it right back to Star Trek.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he was doing his show.  He had that one-man show or something that he was doing, or the play he had going on.  I know, we wanted to go to that.  We blew it off.  I forgot.  I think it's done already. 
[00:00:30]  He was doing it in San Francisco, and he's like, hello, San Francisco.  Ooh.  How foul.  Oh.  And I was just, I tweeted, well, stop in at this Starfleet Academy while you're there.  Because we all know it's in San Francisco.  Don't we all know that?  Yeah.  He's going to hate you.  Oh, everything always goes back to Star Trek with Bill Shatner.  81?  81.  That motherfucker is chugging for 81.  He looks good, man.  He looks good.  He just looks good. 
[00:01:00]  You don't even have to say, he looks good for 81.  Sharp as a tack.  Huh?  He's a good guy.  Yeah.  Well, um...  Bill Shatner, yeah.  Fucking Tim Tebow is a Jet.  Wow.  What a turn of events this is.  Really?  I hadn't heard.  Oh, my God.  How did this happen?  I don't know.  I'm a Jets fan.  Yeah.  And I simply tweeted that I really, really enjoyed watching Tebow Mania.  Yeah.  But I don't want him on my team. 
[00:01:30]  So you liked it when he was on some other team.  And I was excited.  And I was rooting for the Broncos.  Yeah.  Like, he'd come through with these last-minute fucking victories.  Right.  And it was fun to watch.  But now, in a Jet uniform, not so much.  It's different.  Yeah.  He's your guy.  Now he's your guy.  Now we've got to hope for all that luck.  And the Tebow-ing.  And the Tebow-ing.  Dude, do you know what that's going to be like?  Do you know that?  Just fucking...  So Rex Ryan...  Yeah.  ...is going to try to coach the Jets without cursing. 
[00:02:00]  Because I'm sure Tebow's not going to allow foul language.  And how he feels about the foot fetish thing, too.  The foot fetish.  Well, I tweeted part of the contract.  Rex Ryan gets to clean his feet before every game.  Oh, that's nice.  He does have a little foot fetish there, doesn't he?  And, you know, there's a Jesus thing.  So, you know, you put the two together and you get a cute little tweet that people enjoy.  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!  No, but more importantly, Sanchez is a very insecure quarterback. 
[00:02:30]  And then you bring Tim Tebow and his circus to town?  Yeah.  And after all the Peyton Manning stuff, like, he must have been like,  Oh, well, oh, great.  At least they're not getting Peyton Manning.  I still have...  Oh, Tebow.  And you said it right before the show.  No matter what.  Oh, yeah, the fans.  First home game, Sanchez could be firing fucking 400 yards passing.  Doesn't matter.  He could have five touchdown passes.  They're all going to be cheering Tebow.  Tebow!  They're going to be chanting Tebow.  No matter what Sanchez does.  Yeah. 
[00:03:00]  It's not even waiting for Sanchez to suck.  No, no, no.  They're just going to be chanting Tebow.  Because we're assholes in New York.  Fans are...  We're assholes!  Yeah.  All the fucking 15 jerseys that they're going to have.  Right.  Going to pile them on in the...  Pile them in the closet with the fucking Lynn Sanity jerseys.  Hey, hey, Lynn Sanity's back.  Five games they won under the new Toodler.  I'm Mike Woodson, and I'm glad you're paying attention.  Yes, I am.  Mike Woodson looks a little weird, but he's getting that team to play together. 
[00:03:30]  Getting the job done.  That's all I care about.  Getting the job done.  He's got a very creepy, very dark goatee that really bothers me.  And a very shiny, bald head.  I haven't looked enough.  I just saw some stills of him.  And his eyes are a little strange.  A little goofy.  But he's getting the guys to play together.  So Lynn Sanity's back officially.  But is it Lynn that's doing it, or is he just the guy on the team and not the savior?  Well, they're all playing well now.  They're playing as a team.  And as we know, basketball is a team sport. 
[00:04:00]  So it's kind of good that it's a little Lynn Sanity, a little Stoudemire, Carmelo.  Anthony's still fucking throwing up bricks for the most part.  And what is the Tebow thing called?  Is it called?  Tim Sanity.  Tebow Sanity?  No, it's Tim Sanity.  Tim Sanity.  So far, they're going with Tim Sanity.  Is there any other psychosis we could tag on the end of Tebow that makes it a little different than Lynn Sanity?  I can't wait to get Florentine on today.  Tebow Ranoia? 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, I can't wait.  Florentine's going to lose his mind.  But Tebow picked the Jets over his hometown team.  Yeah.  Because there was some weird thing that happened.  The Broncos traded him to the Jets, but then there was something in his contract.  And then the Broncos turned around and supposedly allowed Tebow to make the choice where he wants to go.  It would have cost the Jets $5 million to take him.  And then I guess they discussed it with the Broncos and they decided to split it to 2.5 mil each.  Yeah, some kind of contractual thing. 
[00:05:00]  So then at about 9 o'clock last night, the deal went through.  But he picked the Jets over to Jacksonville.  That would have been his hometown team.  That was exactly what Florentine was saying, though.  What?  You don't want to be there with your family.  Oh, right.  That's right.  It was exactly what Florentine was saying.  I'm asking you for tickets.  Right.  I forgot about that.  You're right.  Yeah.  We're going to try to get Florentine on around 7.30 or so.  Oh, yeah.  Because he's great with this stuff.  But, I mean, where are the Jets fans?  What are you thinking?  I don't see people going, rah, rah, rah. 
[00:05:30]  This is amazing.  I think it's split.  Where are the Jets fans?  You know where they are?  Getting their fucking number 15s.  Mack and the Mad Dog.  They're on Mad Dog.  They're waiting for Mad Dog.  They are?  Yeah.  We're going to be talking about Tim Tebow this morning.  Joining the Jets.  Yeah, they're going to talk about that.  Taking your calls.  It's going to be all fucking day.  All fucking day.  How you doing, dog?  Let me tell you.  Not too happy about this Tebow situation.  A lot of people are calling not too happy about the Tebow situation.  Tim Saturday.  Tim Saturday in New York City. 
[00:06:00]  Tim Saturday.  Tim Saturday.  I'm not feeling it.  Sanchez already.  Yeah.  Confidence down and this is going to make things worse.  It'll be fun.  Fuck it.  As a Jets fan.  But I don't know.  It'll be fun.  Yeah.  I don't know what they're going to do.  Are they going to rotate quarterbacks during the game?  During the game?  Because obviously Tim Tebow knows that wildcat shit.  Yeah.  And it's made for him.  And the Jets kind of like doing that from time to time.  So what?  You bring him in to do a few of those?  Let me ask you this.  And then you bring Sanchez in because he does have the better throwing arm out of the two? 
[00:06:30]  It's going to kill Sanchez.  As far as accuracy goes, Sanchez is a better passer.  Can they do this?  Let me ask you this.  Yes, they can.  Bring both of them out on the field, right?  They snap the ball to Sanchez.  And now depending on what happens, Sanchez gives it to Tebow and he does his thing.  Or Sanchez could just like...  You know what?  You're not crazy.  But you're not crazy.  Because Rex Ryan's a lunatic.  Rex Ryan loves it.  Two quarterbacks.  Rex Ryan loves the spotlight.  That would be hilarious. 
[00:07:00]  It's all about Rex Ryan going, I love the spotlight.  Give me the Tebow mania.  Tebow mania.  I need the Tebow mania.  Well, that's what our own Broadway Joe Willie Namath is saying.  Oh, boy.  He's not happy.  You heard that?  Not happy with the whole thing.  Joe Willie, Broadway Joe Willie Namath is saying it's a publicity stunt.  Right.  He's not happy about it.  And he doesn't think it's a good deal.  And then he was drunk and said, I love you to some girl and tried to feel intense.  Yeah, he was trying to make out with somebody.  I love you. 
[00:07:30]  I love you.  You got that Joe Namath clip?  One of the all-time great Jets quarterbacks, Joe Namath and Chad Pennington.  What impresses you about Chad?  I believe everything that anyone else has watched Chad play impresses me the same thing impresses  them.  He's a quality, classy quarterback that has a touch on the football.  He's not a thrower, he's a passer. 
[00:08:00]  His mind is ahead of what the defense is.  And if the Jets can support him, they will win the championship.  Joe, it's been a tough season for Jet fans.  What does it mean to you now when the team is struggling?  I want to kiss you.  I couldn't care less about the team struggling.  What we know is we can improve.  Chad missed, Chad Pennington, our quarterback missed the first part of the season and we struggled. 
[00:08:30]  We're looking for next season.  We're looking to make a noise now and I want to kiss you.  Thanks, Joe.  Yeah.  Huge compliment.  Joe Namath, part of the fourth big A team.  I want to kiss you.  He said struggling.  I hate his accent.  I don't care about the team struggling.  Team struggling.  I want to fuck you. 
[00:09:00]  We can play the shorter clip next time E-Rock plays.  We don't need to hear about Chad Pennington.  He's long gone.  Chad Pennington.  E-Rock started playing the game in the first quarter.  Right.  Commercials.  E-Rock played the clip when he guaranteed a Super Bowl win.  I want to hear the...  That's a long time ago.  I do remember.  Yes, it is.  Can we find the new Joe Namath clip?  Because, yeah, he said this is a publicity stunt.  Yeah.  Even though Sanchez was struggling.  Struggling.  He was struggling.  I don't care how he's going to play. 
[00:09:30]  He's not a thrower.  He's a passer.  He's a classic quarterback.  He's awful.  Terrible accent.  Let's say hi to Walt in Jersey.  Where are the Jets fans today?  Come on.  Come on.  Walt!  Mad Dog's not on for a while, so we got you.  Let's go on, Walt.  Right.  Well, this fucking thing sucks a dick.  Whoa.  You bet it does.  I can't.  Tebow's just fucking retarded.  He doesn't know what he's doing.  He doesn't know how to play football.  He doesn't.  I don't think he knows how to play football. 
[00:10:00]  This guy's a little extreme.  He says hike, and then he runs the ball.  He throws like a girl.  I mean, Sanchez is a way better quarterback.  And I don't know what to do.  It's just a big publicity stunt, like you guys are saying.  Well.  But it's fucking retarded.  Tebow retarded.  You heard it here first.  But he did well for the Broncos.  Who cares?  Broncos got lucky if fucking cheaters were with them.  I don't need that shit over here in New York.  See, this is the problem.  Does Tebow understand the fan base is much different in New York than Denver? 
[00:10:30]  They're not going to be as tolerant as they were in Denver.  No.  He better fucking have some good games right out of the fucking gate.  Yep.  Because this is how Jets fans think.  Yeah, right here.  This guy.  He's retarded.  Right.  Just blowing off that he actually had a really good year for the Broncos.  And turned that organization around when they were dead in the water.  That's New York, though.  It goes along all the stupid moves.  Woody Johnson's doing.  Brett Favre.  Blacksville Burris.  All these fucking big-name guys. 
[00:11:00]  And now he brings in Tebow.  He's going to ruin Sanchez.  And I thought, Woody, he just fucked our whole year.  That's a weird fit, knowing that Sanchez lacks some confidence out there to begin with.  But people are going to be watching, that's for sure.  Oh, fuck yeah, I'll be watching.  People are going to be watching this shit.  I watched a million Broncos games last year because of this, Tebow.  And now he's on my team.  And it is.  Gotta watch.  Entertainment, you know?  That's what this whole thing is.  So, like, what's the...  You could look at it like, well, as far as the classic sport end of it goes, it's, oh, 
[00:11:30]  I don't like the deal.  But it's fucking entertainment.  They want people to watch the games.  They want people to show up at the games.  They want people to buy the jerseys.  So, is it really a bad move when you have to look at it, look at the big picture, as  they say?  They're going to be selling some jerseys, too.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Those Tebow jerseys.  Oh, boy.  All the girls, I think they have a shot.  Oh, with the pink Tebow jerseys.  That don't know, right.  Oh.  Yeah.  How many of the gals are getting their number 15 today? 
[00:12:00]  Oh, forget about it.  They're going to love it.  I don't know.  I mean, and then you, what, you don't start Tebow?  It all depends on how Sanchez looks in, you know, preseason.  Yeah.  If he's struggling, they're going to throw him in in a second.  This is terrible for Mark Sanchez, because he's going to be playing with this fucking  monkey on his back.  Like, this overlooking his shoulder the whole time.  Oh, shit.  Sorry.  Right.  But it's overlooking his shoulder.  He's fucking in deep trouble, man.  But they just re-signed him or whatever. 
[00:12:30]  Gave him a little extension.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'm stupid.  So what was that?  So he could be the backup for Tebow?  Like, how is this going to work?  Yeah.  Has Rex Ryan explained any of this yet?  Not a peep out of them.  Because you don't get Tebow to sit the bench.  I don't think.  And who was that player on the Jets that tweeted, we don't need Tebow?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Somebody tweeted that before the deal went through.  Probably Holmes.  So that's got to be like.  Probably Holmes.  It's got to be frustrating when members of the team are saying they don't need him. 
[00:13:00]  Antonio Holmes, probably.  Yeah?  Was it?  Well, he doesn't really get along with fucking Sanchez.  He certainly isn't going to get along with Tebow.  Tebow?  Because Holmes needs the ball.  Cromarty said it?  Cromarty.  Oh, how about that?  Cromarty should completely agree with this.  They both don't believe in birth control.  19 kids.  Cromarty.  They both don't believe in birth control.  No.  They're one in the same, these two. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  Fuck that birth control, right?  Fuck that shit.  Cromarty.  Who used the rhythm method?  How many kids does Cromarty have?  19.  I don't know.  I don't think it's 19.  It's up there, though.  Come on.  Help me out.  How many kids does Cromarty have?  Maybe nine.  Cromarty.  How many kids does Cromarty have?  18 or something?  Is it really that high?  Is it that many?  No, nine?  I would say nine-ish.  Cromarty has seven kids.  What?  You're just saying.  What do you have to say with authority? 
[00:14:00]  I never believe Jimmy anymore.  It's terrible.  Travis loves this deal for the Jets.  He was telling me before the show.  Oh, yeah.  This is a great deal for the Jets.  Good job.  Yeah.  You don't believe that, right?  No.  Not at all.  It stinks.  It's stupid.  It makes no sense.  Well, the diagnosis from Dr. Gay is in.  Yeah, thanks.  Well, it just shows you the 200 happy birthday Dr. Gay messages on Facebook.  Yes, I can't believe it.  Oh, happy birthday.  I can't believe it.  Dr. Gay.  I can't believe I forgot your birth, Gay.  That's fine.  I'm not a birthday guy.  He was just trying to say birth, Gay. 
[00:14:30]  No, I thought of it this way.  Nobody did that.  When I said birth, I was going to say birthday.  Why was your birthday?  That's right.  So why don't we have a birthday calendar?  I know.  We really should.  We're shitty people.  We really are.  We're just horrid people.  Uncaring.  How old are you?  31.  Wow.  You were just a kid when you started with us.  Oh, my God.  What happened?  Why are we staying the same age and you guys are getting older?  I remember when he first showed up on his first day of work, he had long dyed hair  and he had a cat in his hand.  What?  No? 
[00:15:00]  No, you're thinking of me when I was 15.  Oh, yes, I always do.  I often think of you at 15.  Little twink.  I know.  I feel like I've spent my whole life here.  Travis, why is this a bad deal for the Jets?  I'm sorry for everything you've already said.  Come on.  Nobody can possibly think that this is going to work out.  You don't spend all that money and give up draft picks and do all that just to sign a backup quarterback.  It's just a controversy waiting to happen. 
[00:15:30]  I don't think they're signing him to be the backup.  I think they have no confidence.  Well, that's what they're saying they are.  But I don't think they have confidence in Sanchez.  They'll start the season with Sanchez, certainly.  But as soon as he has one of those bad games and you have 80,000 people screaming Tebow, guess who's coming in the game?  Absolutely.  And if he turns around and has a good game, then guess who's starting the next week?  Oh, poor Sanchez.  Has he said anything, Sanchez?  Is there any statements yet?  Yeah, the blah, blah, blah statement.  Very happy.  Blah, blah, blah.  Very happy to have my board.  Great.  This is going to be a great season for the Jets. 
[00:16:00]  I'm very happy.  Blah, blah, blah.  Wow.  Is that you when you first started here?  Jeez, that was...  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Wow, wait.  What a twerp.  What happened to you?  What happened to everybody?  Seven years.  It's like seven years on fucking Devil's Island.  It really is.  He's been here seven years.  Seven years.  Years.  Wow, yeah.  Look at you.  You're a little skinny little fucking kid.  That was after a couple of years. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, man.  He's still skinny, though.  Eh.  Well.  No, not so much.  He's kind of bearded and jaded.  Oh, aw.  Oh, my God.  Well, that is.  That kind of looks the same.  Almost the same.  Aw, you wacky kids.  All he is.  Spent a lot of time here.  Look, there's me and Kiefer.  Oh, wow.  Where was that?  That was at K-Rock.  That's K-Rock.  You guys were in Philly one day.  And he came to do JV Elvis.  And Kiefer came in.  Yeah.  It was great.  Never been more happy to not travel with the show.  Aw.  Let's see.  Just going through photo montages of young Travis. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  So, terrible deal.  Huh?  Terrible deal.  Yeah.  That seems to be the consensus.  Another picture of me, Danny.  Danny just keeps pulling up pictures of Travis.  Much to Travis's chagrin.  I can't find anyone that is for the Tebow move.  I am.  Mike in Queens.  Mikey.  I'm happy about it.  Hey.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hilarious.  Listen, I work nights, right?  And I got up yesterday after the 5 o'clock in the afternoon. 
[00:17:30]  And I had about 15 text messages all from my Jet fan buddies.  And not one of them was fucking positive.  Nobody wants this fucking guy on the team.  Nobody.  I don't understand.  I don't understand anybody.  This is what a life of me, bro.  I can't understand it.  Somebody tried to rationalize what the fuck the Jets are doing.  And they just gave Sanchez a contract extension.  Yeah.  I don't know.  We'll have to wait and see how this is going to work out.  I don't know.  Rex Ryan hasn't said anything yet, huh?  Yeah, they were talking last night during a conference call. 
[00:18:00]  And what did he say?  Well, he wasn't there.  But, you know, the Jets are saying exactly what they should be saying,  that they're going to use him in wildcat, third down, goal line situations.  He's the backup quarterback.  Everyone's got a backup quarterback.  All we did was change our backup quarterback today.  But it's complete bullshit.  They're trying to downplay that Tebow's just a backup quarterback?  He's got a massive fan base.  And the massive fan base is going to be screaming Tebow whenever they can.  Absolutely.  Are you kidding me?  That's what they're saying.  It's a terrible deal. 
[00:18:30]  As soon as he throws one interception, everybody's going to be called for Tebow.  Yeah, well, like we said even before that, they're just going to be Tebow, Tebow,  the whole fucking crowd.  You're going to hear that the first game.  And Mark Sanchez is not mentally tough to begin with.  Nope.  Like, he's just not good.  And people can just chant Tebow, because I'll say it again, because they're just assholes.  Yeah, yeah.  They probably don't even want him in the game.  They just want to fucking make a noise.  Then there's going to be those signs in the stands where people drew in bad proportion, 
[00:19:00]  Tebow, Tebowing.  You know, it's going to be like these dumb fucking dopey looking.  The legs are too fat.  His head's too small.  Drawings.  These people are artistically challenged.  Hate those.  Is that happening on Draw Something?  Of course it is.  Does Tebow come up ever?  Draw Something now.  Just racist, sexist, homophobic pictures.  Of course.  Of course.  I'm still all in, though.  I don't know.  I'm playing with like fucking 30 people. 
[00:19:30]  It sucks.  I haven't found one Jets fan that likes this.  But you're not going to.  This is a situation where there's not going to be a Jets fan going, I like the move.  But other teams would have looked totally against anything a Jets fan would like.  But I would assume other teams would have loved to have Tebow on their team, no?  Are they going to trade him, do you think?  Tebow?  Is there a possibility of getting him a trade?  No.  No.  No way.  For who?  They gave away two draft picks?  They wouldn't have gone through all that trouble.  Yeah, no way.  No, they're looking forward to the money they're going to make on jerseys.  On fucking merch.  On the merch alone. 
[00:20:00]  At least he'll be in New York.  Maybe we can get him on the show.  Is he?  I shouldn't say that.  Huh?  That's Roland's thing.  I shouldn't laugh at Roland like that.  He does get some trade.  We got a guy that's for the Tebow trade.  Oh, okay.  Who's this, Tebow?  Could be the best.  Mikey.  Yeah.  Hey.  Mike, let's go.  Yeah, let's go.  Love it.  All right, listen.  The rumor is that Sanchez does not work hard in practice, okay?  The Jets are not going to keep Mark Sanchez. 
[00:20:30]  He's made no progress in three years.  Yeah, you're right.  That's why they just gave him an extension.  That totally makes sense.  Yeah, what about the extension thing?  Dr. Gay faced you, motherfucker.  Oh, shit.  All Tebow ever has done is win, no matter where he goes.  Yeah.  Even with Jesus.  Oh, good points.  This is the only guy that we found.  Yeah.  Mike.  Mike.  You got to sell it better than this.  Mike?  Come on.  That's all I got for you, guys.  Oh.  I'm going to see little Jimmy at Uncle Vinny's on Friday.  Oh, yeah.  On Friday and Saturday.  Thank you, buddy.  All right, man.  All right.  Let me say hi to Charlie on Long Island. 
[00:21:00]  Charlie.  Bless you.  Let's go.  What's up?  What's up, guys?  How are you?  All right.  Hey, listen.  Real quick.  First of all, the Sanchez extension, all they did was free up salary cap room.  He's not making any more money than he was.  So, that's a bunch of crap.  Second of all, Tebow is going to be used to replace Brad Smith, who was a receiver they  had ago last year at free agency.  He was a college quarterback.  They listed him as a wide receiver.  They brought him in to run the Wildcat.  That's what Tebow is going to do.  This whole quarterback controversy is crap.  Can he play wide receiver? 
[00:21:30]  I don't know if it's crap.  That's definitely not crap.  No, no.  Tebow won't be playing wide receiver.  He'll be running the Wildcat, which Brad Smith did.  Exactly.  Brad Smith was listed as a receiver.  Right.  But he played quarterback, so he knew how to throw and shit like that.  So, they brought him in for the Wildcat.  That is true.  But won't you know the Wildcats come in if they bring him in?  For the most part, yeah.  And then the other team will go, Wildcat defense!  Wildcat defense!  But then maybe Tebow surprises you and throws long. 
[00:22:00]  That's the craziness of it.  Who knows?  It is crazy.  But you can't just say the quarterback controversy is crap.  You can't say that.  You can't just say it's not going to exist.  That is going to be a mess.  You have two quarterbacks on the team.  That's going to be a massive headline leading right up to fucking opening day.  And beyond.  We already had a controversy.  Half the fan base is already sick of Sanchez.  Anybody who is hating on Sanchez now has been hating on him for months.  That's why there's a quarterback controversy.  Because the half that don't like him, they're going to be screaming Tebow at every chance they get. 
[00:22:30]  Now, but this guy's right.  They're bringing him in to do a punt like Danny White, sir.  Good old Danny White.  Remember him?  Oh, literal Jim.  Oh.  No one was chanting for Kellen Clemens' name, you know?  Right.  But when Tebow's his backup, they're definitely going to be doing that.  Tebow mania.  Tebow mania.  Tim Sanity.  I like to give awful chants.  Like, I'm going to go there and go, make a touchdown, Tim, Tebow.  Oh, that's a good one.  That nobody will jump on.  It's awkward.  No rhythm to it. 
[00:23:00]  No rhythm fucking chants.  You're going to have to compete with Fireman Ed with that one.  Come on, Tim.  Do the best you can for us.  Come on, Tim.  Do the best you can.  No.  For us.  Doesn't work.  Tapers off.  But then you've got to think, all right, so Tebow would go to the Jets assuming that  he would be the backup, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  Because you've got to think.  Well, it's not his decision.  Huh?  Well, he probably would have started with the Jaguars, right? 
[00:23:30]  Look, he's just, he's not a good quarterback.  He's.  Or Tebow?  Yeah, he shouldn't be starting anywhere.  This whole thing's just frustrating.  Are you trying to say he got lucky last year?  Yes!  But he has Gwad on his side.  Sure does.  That Gwad could do some amazing things.  Yes.  Jesus is on his side.  That's right.  And now New York has Jesus.  Jets are going to make a ton of merchandise money.  And that's it?  And that's it.  So weird.  I know.  How did this happen? 
[00:24:00]  How did he become a Jet?  How did this happen?  How did that happen?  Yeah, yeah.  The Broncos loved him.  What happened?  What the fuck happened?  Yeah.  Elway showed his balls, though.  Good for him.  He made the right move.  Yeah.  You got to go with Peyton Manning over Tim Tebow.  You have to.  Yeah, Peyton Manning.  And you see that he could still do it?  You got to go for it.  No, you don't.  Where's Florentine?  Why?  Yeah, right.  They gave him a contract extension.  Now what? 
[00:24:30]  No, you don't.  Jim just makes these great definitive statements.  He's very hard to debate with because he's very logical.  He makes great points when it comes to sports.  He makes really good points.  I've heard him argue dolphins for so many years, so when these guys call in, I'm just  like, you don't know what you're...  I don't think I've ever argued football with him because I never...  You know, this has never been a cause to.  But I know it's going to be a problem if I ever have to.  We found someone that loves the trade.  Oh, wow.  Just loves it.  Glenn in New Hampshire. 
[00:25:00]  Glenn.  Morning, gentlemen.  I love this trade.  It's great.  I'm a Pac fan.  It's just guys...  Oh, all right.  Guaranteed two more wins.  Fucking asshole.  What are they saying up there on sports radio?  I haven't even been listening to it.  I was in the satellite.  I was in the satellite.  I was in the satellite.  And then my day's basically over.  Thank you, sir.  I appreciate that.  Thank you, man.  All right.  Thank you.  What sports show do you think booked the big Fireman Ed interview this morning? 
[00:25:30]  Oh, man.  I would go with...  Mike?  Boomer and Carton.  Who's Fireman Ed?  You don't know who Fireman Ed is?  You've been in New York all these years?  What's wrong with you?  Jim, where have you been?  I don't know Fireman Ed.  I'm glad.  Jim.  Whoever he is, I'm glad I don't know him.  He gets the...  No one's allowed a chant until Fireman Ed says it's okay to.  Ew.  He actually goes like this and quiets the whole crowd.  Oh, yeah.  And everyone listens.  Game's all about him.  And then he dramatically pauses. 
[00:26:00]  And then he does the Jets chant.  You don't know Fireman Ed.  And the place goes nuts.  You don't know Fireman Ed?  No.  I don't.  Oh, he just yells a lot.  He's a big fan.  He's a fan, yeah.  Can you see if there's any...  Fireman Ed.  But the Jets have finally acknowledged him a few years back now and...  Yeah, they send him to playoff games.  And they've given him great seats and everything.  Let's see what Fireman Ed says.  Ah, you know, it's a good...  There's a fuck.  No, he just controls the chant.  That's wonderful.  He gets on, what, is it his brother-in-law's shoulders?  Something like that.  I don't know.  That's cool. 
[00:26:30]  He gets up there and everyone goes, oh, Fireman Ed's about to chant.  People take pictures with Fireman Ed.  Oh, fuck yeah.  That's cool.  Fireman Ed should chant, this organization won't get its own stadium.  Blah, blah.  We've been fucking the fans for 40 years.  Blah, blah.  No, the new stadium is both the Jets and Giants.  Exactly.  It's not.  Officially.  It's not.  Yeah, officially.  It's terrible.  Could you get a video of Fireman Ed doing what he does best?  Because it'll drive Jimmy nuts.  I can't believe you've never heard of Fireman Ed.  No.  Always up on the big screen.  Why wouldn't he be with his fire helmet?  Look, look. 
[00:27:00]  He's calming everyone down.  You're not a dictator.  See?  Oh, boy.  They all wait for him, Jimmy.  They all wait for him.  Well, then not only is he annoying, but they're even bigger assholes than he is.  Enough with him on the Jumbotron.  And I guarantee there are people that hate his guts.  Yes, they do.  Look, the dramatic pause.  Because these dumb motherfuckers don't know when to start the J in Jets. 
[00:27:30]  You know what, though?  They need a little direction.  Yeah.  It's pretty impressive because one day he just started that and it's gotten to the point where  the whole stadium looks at him.  Who's the bigger cunt, him or the cowbell man at City Field Chaser?  I hate cowbell man.  I hate fucking cowbell.  Is he with the Mets?  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  I don't mind Fireman Ed at all, actually. 
[00:28:00]  And the guy from the Yankee Stadium.  Freddie Says.  Freddie Says stunk.  Freddie Says.  A three-way head-on collision on the fucking West Side Highway.  He had the frying pan, right?  Who was the frying pan guy?  Yeah, and he gave you the spoon.  And the spoon.  Oh, cowbell guy.  Wait a minute.  And you'd hear that coming over when you're watching the game at home and you're like,  hey, you just wanted a good drive there to fucking strangle him.  Just a jerk off making noise. 
[00:28:30]  Looking for attention.  Just a guy who decides one day that he wants it.  Stop it.  Dude, he's doing it for 20 seconds.  Just shut the fuck up.  Stop it.  I hate these fucking fans.  You don't like the Uber fans?  Hate.  No, I say I hate them for being fans.  But Fireman Ed annoys me the least because he's just doing a chant that other people are  chiming in with.  He's not making so much noise himself.  Like these other two douchebags.  Fucking cowbell and fucking frying pan fucking teddy and fucking assholes. 
[00:29:00]  Bells McGillicuddy.  Fucking teddy.  Bells McGillicuddy.  Jingle, jingle, jingle.  Jingle, jingle, jingle.  Bells McGillicuddy.  He's got jester shoes on.  Jingle, jingle.  Walk, jingle.  Fuck yourself.  Ted should be a super fan.  Ted should have a fucking gimmick.  Oh, my God.  Freddy Says.  It's Freddy Says.  Ted hates these people.  Ted hates them?  Yes.  What about Teddy Says?  Yeah, what about Teddy Says?  Teddy Says!  Make a home run, Tim!  I would love to hear Teddy Says. 
[00:29:30]  Why not?  Yeah, I know Freddy's dead, by the way.  You're making fun of a dead guy.  Oh, shit.  I saw him.  I walked by him in Stump Brain when we went to the old stadium.  That's Freddy Says.  And I'm like, what?  That's what I said to him.  What?  Why did he get angry, though?  Because who is an old guy?  What the fuck do I care about him for?  But some of these guys take off, and some of them fail miserably.  Yeah, I know.  When I was going to the Islanders games there, there was a guy that would wear an orange pom-pom,  basically.  It was like his hair, and then he had an Islander hat on, and he never took off, and he tried 
[00:30:00]  so fucking hard.  What about kitten squeezy guy?  Who?  The guy that just grabs a kitten and squeezes him to go, meow, meow.  That wouldn't wash.  I'm trying to get a thing started where it's called Comments by Larry, and I carry a suggestion  box around, and I have a big hat with an L on it, and you put in your comments, and I  quietly read them later.  Oh, shit. 
[00:30:30]  Everyone's trying to say the Greg Williams, Sean Payton story is much bigger.  I guess it is, huh?  I think so, yeah, absolutely.  Dave in Texas, go ahead.  Yeah, I think the Sean Payton and Greg Williams story is a little bit bigger, man.  I mean, they let that dude go for the whole season, and indefinitely for Greg Williams.  That's some crazy shit.  Everybody knows their fucking bounty ball has been going on with the Cowboys and the fucking 
[00:31:00]  Eagles for years.  Oh, so this isn't new just to the Saints?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The Saints, man.  Greg Williams, they suspended him for the whole year.  Oh, no, no.  I know.  I know, but I'm just saying, did other teams have this type of bounty thing?  Oh, fuck.  Back in the early 80s.  Yeah, the Saints are just the first ones to get caught.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, they called it the bounty ball every time the fucking Eagles played the Cowboys.  It's been going on for years.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a huge story.  I mean, you suspend your head coach for a year, or the NFL suspends him for a year? 
[00:31:30]  That is bad.  Without pay, right?  Yeah.  And then indefinite for, wow.  That's huge.  And they're saying Jeremy Shockey.  That's what I read, that he may have been the rat.  Might have been the rat, and Jeremy Shockey's like,  I'm no rat.  Did he get in trouble?  Did he get traded or something?  I don't know.  Sap said it was Jeremy Shockey, and Jeremy Shockey's saying, I'm no rat.  Wait, what team's he on?  Shockey was on the Saints.  But he's gone?  I think so. 
[00:32:00]  I don't remember.  I don't know.  It's a huge story, though.  It is a huge story.  All right, well, I love you, boys.  Feel good.  Have a good day, okay?  Okay.  That was pretty good.  Not too shabbly.  You know who my favorite fan person is?  Did you ever see the old lady?  She goes to Buccaneers games, Bullhorn Edna.  And she just holds a bullhorn, but she never uses it.  She just waves.  Edna?  Yeah, Bullhorn Edna.  That's horrible.  And she wears adult diapers on the outside of her dress and waves her bullhorn at people. 
[00:32:30]  Especially minorities.  She waves it aggressively at minorities.  Oh, good.  Bullhorn Edna's a good one.  Let me go to Rich on Long Island.  He really likes the Tebow trade.  He's mad at all of us.  Oh.  And the rest of the media and the rest of the fan base for not understanding.  Rich, go ahead.  All right.  In all seriousness, why is this not a good trade?  Like, we were suffering from third-down convergence, red zone offense, okay?  Our locker room, they all hate each other, which he's also known for, you know, bringing the team together. 
[00:33:00]  Is he?  Yeah, exactly.  They all get together and question his sexuality.  They'll talk about him when he's gone.  Hey, listen, the guy creeps me the fuck out just as much as anybody else in the Northeast, okay?  But, I mean, in all seriousness, I mean, it's not like he's replacing Sanchez.  And now that we need somebody up Sanchez's ass, maybe in the literal sense, who knows, okay?  And, you know, I think it's a good thing.  You're okay.  Rich, you mean? 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  But, you know what, Tebow probably is a nice guy.  He's a great guy, obviously.  It's easy to be annoyed with him.  I just, my opinion is that he's fighting a demon, and I almost wish for his sake that he could just fucking, but he can't because he's an athlete.  But he's connected to Taylor Swift now.  What?  How?  I don't know.  There's rumors that he's connected to Taylor Swift.  What?  They both date the same fella?  Hey, Rich, you make really good points, but the one thing I want to ask you is the whole Sanchez thing, because we all know he's lacked self-confidence. 
[00:34:00]  Well, I guess, but also, too, I think it's because the last three years he had so much pressure on him.  Yeah.  I think he's going to take attention away from Sanchez, and I think it's going to be less pressure on him.  You don't think he's going to feel pressure having the most popular quarterback in the last...  In history!  Yeah, in history, like, right behind him?  He's close to...  Honestly, I don't.  I think it's going to have a negative...  I think it's going to have the opposite effect.  He's close to having the biggest fan base in the NFL.  They said at the Super Bowl, it was unbelievable how many people he travels with. 
[00:34:30]  It's a whole fucking circus with this guy now.  Apostles.  And you think that first game where Sanchez is...  The first time Sanchez is having a bad game and the whole stadium is chanting Tebow, that Sanchez is going to be all right with that?  No, probably not, but at least I think that'll light a fire.  I think it's either going to light a fire on their events, or it's going to be so much pressure put on Tebow and all the media, that's going to have the opposite effect. 
[00:35:00]  Shut up all to yourself.  All right.  Excited.  You know how many times that camera is going to pan over to Tebow on the side of the house?  Oh, praying.  It's all about God Boy.  Giving everybody a little pep talk.  It's all about God Boy.  Guys come off the field, if they had a little problem on field, and Tebow put his arm around him and be like,  Hey, it's okay.  We'll get him next time.  Get out there, and then he'll get down.  They're going to hire him here and do a talk to Tim segment.  Do you have problems talking?  No, I got it.  It's a great idea.  They'll have him. 
[00:35:30]  They'll pan $40 million.  They'll put his picture in the lobby.  It's talk to Tim time.  We do it once during the summer solstice.  You can call up and talk to Tim.  We fucking pass you through.  He's in an ISDN line in a glory hole.  Does anybody know how to get his manager?  I'll get married in August.  I want to see if he could marry me and my wife, my future wife.  All right.  Thank you, Rich.  He's not allowed to.  I don't believe in this state.  Listen, Kevin Smith's coming down the hall.  We'll take a quick break.  Yay, Kevin.  Kevin Smith on the air. 
[00:36:00]  We're going to go to break quickly here so we can get some room for Kevin.  Stay there.  Kevin Smith in studio.  Good morning, everybody.  Welcome back.  Bad hair day for me, man.  What happened?  I didn't get a chance to shower.  I was signing last night at the Barnes & Noble in Union Square, and we went rather long. 
[00:36:30]  And then I got back to the hotel, and I was like, go to sleep or smoke weed.  It's never a question.  That's a morning question now, too.  I usually wake up 4, 5, 6, and the reason I wake up is I go, why am I sleeping?  There's weed here.  Wow, man.  And once I start smoking, I get to work, so the day kind of begins.  So I went to sleep kind of late and whatnot, and then when I got up this morning, I didn't  have a chance to take a shower.  So the whole ride in, I'm fussing with my hair, and then I'm like, why do I give a shower? 
[00:37:00]  It doesn't matter.  It's fucking radio.  It is, but then I got to go to Imas after this, and they shoot that shit, too.  Oh, believe me.  And TV, dude.  Every TV show I've been on in the last week, because I was on a few morning shows to promote  the book and whatnot, there's always that behind-you camera that does that rolling back shot.  Oh, no.  Always, dude.  And if you catch me from the front, it's passable.  You go, I wouldn't fuck him.  He's fat, but, well, he's a good guy.  He's got some hair.  That's what they say.  He's got some hair.  You can pull it off.  But the moment they put that shot behind you, people go, he's lost his power. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, shit.  None whatsoever.  Fuck him.  I don't believe anything.  He says, look at that big-ass fucking bald spot.  Fry your tuck, fuck.  Oh, shit.  But then I was on a CBS morning news show, and I came after Matt Weiner from Mad Men.  I always got to be careful how to say the name, because immediately you want to say Wiener.  Wiener, yeah.  That's what it looks like.  It was Wiener.  I love that fucking show.  Yeah, it's great.  That dude's sitting there just dropping signs, and he's got, like, the full fucking bald with 
[00:38:00]  the hula skirt around the back.  Right, yeah, yeah.  And I was sitting there going, that dude's one of the bad-ass-ass creators ever fucking lived,  and he got even less hair than you.  Fuck off.  Like, it's fine.  It doesn't matter, man.  Yeah, there he is.  Some guys look good.  Like, Robert Duvall looked good with hair like that.  Didn't he?  Forever.  He's had it forever, yeah.  That guy must have just been, like, bald at 12.  He picked it.  He was like, I'm going to go with a hairline that I'm going to live into.  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  How is everybody doing, man?  Good, man.  I was just in Orlando when you were there.  How was your Orlando show?  It was good.  Yeah, we didn't see each other, though. 
[00:38:30]  It was decent.  Half full crowd, but you know, Kev, a good half.  The half you want.  The desirable half.  Oh, that's that, boy.  Tee-hee.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It was a fun weekend.  There was more people, but the ones that showed up were good.  When are you shooting your thing?  April 28th in Cleveland.  And that is, there's a me-Australia conflict, but...  Yes.  Are we still trying to work something out?  I put my head in things and pulled them out.  Well, no, I haven't because you're gone.  You're going to be away.  You said nothing.  What's wrong?  Yeah, no, we're actually still looking. 
[00:39:00]  What's this about?  I'm shooting my hour in April 28th.  No, we know that, but what's the Kevin angle?  I would love Kevin to direct this.  Last time I was here, he was talking about doing it, and I was like, ah, but we're going  to Australia.  But he'll be out of the country.  And we couldn't extend anymore, because as it is, they gave me a two-week turnaround time instead  of a one month.  For those who, I mean, I'm sure everybody listening knows, but are you talking about  it?  Oh, yes.  Both shows sold out, yeah.  What?  Now, when you say my hour, what is that for?  I'm shooting an hour of stand-up for a production company, and it's going on Epics first, and 
[00:39:30]  then it's going on...  You're an Epics brother.  Yes, yes, yes.  Brother Epics.  Brother of Epics.  I like those guys a lot.  They're fantastic.  I also like their business model, because it's like, yeah, we're a cable channel, but we  also live online.  Yes.  So if you can't get to your TV to turn it on, just jump online and click on.  I'm so smart.  It's very smart, but what they're doing is essentially what HBO did in the late 70s,  early 80s, or when they started.  These cats are just like, let's just do comedy.  Let's find out who people like on Twitter, who's got nice followings, who we respect, and 
[00:40:00]  we'll start doing it.  So they've done, like, Louis, they've done Louis C.K.  They've done...  Louis Black, too.  Louis Black.  They've done, I think...  You, Janine...  Janine Garofalo, David Cross.  I might be wrong about Louis C.K.  No, no.  I saw him last night.  He said, yeah.  And then when they tapped me for two years ago, we did Too Fat for 40.  I was, like, so fucking flattered.  Because suddenly you feel like George Carlin, to some degree.  You never feel exactly like George Carlin, but like, oh my God, like, somebody's going, 
[00:40:30]  your comedy's good enough to put on fucking TV.  So there's this nice small fraternity slash sorority of comedians that they've been kind  of building specials for and putting on the air.  And they're doing, like, the secret policeman's other ball, the new version.  Right, right.  I passed a fucking billboard for it in here in town.  I saw the Epix logo.  Was that a live show or something?  That was back in the, I would say, early 80s.  And then Harvey and Bob Weinstein, I believe, if I remember my indie film history correctly,  went over to Cannes and bought this movie that was put together as a charity film for, I believe, 
[00:41:00]  Amnesty International.  And it was, like, some artists, recording artists, but also Monty Python and some comedians  and stuff.  Kind of like a fucking comic relief to something, a proto-comic relief or something like that.  And so they brought the footage over here and, you know, they cut out a bunch to make,  because I think it was really long or something like that.  They released it as a secret policeman's ball.  And then they took the footage they cut out, put that in, and released it as the secret  policeman's other ball.  So now Epix, I guess, after years and years, is doing a kind of update. 
[00:41:30]  And I saw, we were going pie in a cab real quick, so I saw the names, and I couldn't  quite focus, but it seemed too fucking hip for the room.  You know, it was all the names.  I'm like, shit, I wish I was on that list.  But I love Epix.  So do you know what it's called?  What is your thing going to be called?  Yeah, I think I'm going to call it Please Be Offended.  That's a good one.  Yeah, I finally came up with the title.  You're so clever, Jim Norton.  Yeah, you know, instead of Please Be Seated and Please Be Quiet, we got it, Jim.  And I'm just, I'm writing up a promo now. 
[00:42:00]  We're going to shoot a promo next week.  Sweet, man.  That's awesome.  That's huge, dude.  You're welcome.  We're in a club together.  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  Elbows.  Secret elbows.  I never did the elbow before.  Secret elbows.  I like it.  You got it now.  I was writing for young James here not too long ago.  His, uh, all of his hit somebody scenes, which amount to like, I would say three hardcore  scenes, but you're throughout every time there's hockey going on.  I've been watching that guy.  He sent me a nice note because I told you, I was like, look at, look at that.  Yeah, I saw the interview too.  And you know what, he sent me back going like, I know what you, I know what you're talking  about.  Because last time I was like, do the Winnie Pooh voice. 
[00:42:30]  Right.  And you're like, the whole fucking movie?  Yeah.  Yeah, I know the guy's vibe.  I know what he is.  He's very soft-spoken and he's married, but you look at him, you'll question him the way you question  Tebow, although he's a married guy.  Right, right, right, especially because it's like 70s, it's kind of, he presents very  straightforward.  Yeah, but you don't see this guy now.  He's right.  Glenn Hall, it's kind of based on the goalie Glenn Hall, who, we watch the interviews with  him on like YouTube or something like that.  He's just, he's fucking adorable.  They called him Mr. Goalie in the game.  And he's got an unbreakable record that nobody in hockey will ever touch. 
[00:43:00]  It's something like, I don't know the exact number, 1600 consecutive games without a  mask.  Oh, and he looks good.  He doesn't look bad at all.  No.  Like, clearly, what we were talking about is an age before the curve stick and the slap  shot was in vogue.  Like, that started happening.  He was on a team at one point with, which one would call it, Bobby, Bobby Hull.  So even in practice, he had to face the Bobby Hull slap shot and that started traveling much  higher than the knees and the stomach.  That's where he started.  Right.  Hey, man.  That's where the mask kind of came in. 
[00:43:30]  Of course.  So you look at the guy and he doesn't look like, you know, he's gotten hit in the face  with a zillion pucks or something like that.  It's crazy, man.  Really, but sweet guy.  Yeah.  Comes across like an uncle or a grandfather, but as you listen to him for a good period  of time, there's like an edge or a cynicism or a sarcasm on everything, but it's always  sweet.  So you imagine back in the day when he was Mr. Goalie, you know, I'm sure he was a straightforward  family man, but this dude probably got so much pussy.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  So he tops him to the bottom because he's just like, hello, how are you? 
[00:44:00]  Oh, he's a sweet dude, but there's a, oh, yeah, oh, how are you?  He wants to be on his farm.  Yes.  He just wants to be painting his barn and stuff.  It's sweet, man.  If you look up Glenn Hall, it's like worth five minutes of your time on YouTube.  Is he still around?  Yeah, I think he's still alive.  He's still alive?  Yeah.  He's got to be old though, man.  He's probably a lot older than he looks.  He's got to be like 80 or something.  Oh, wow.  Close to 80.  Can we find him?  Now I want to hear his voice quickly.  Yeah, pull it up.  If we can.  He tells a story about trying to get a raise because none of those guys got fucking paid. 
[00:44:30]  Like people didn't start getting played in hockey for a while, right?  Especially hockey.  Yeah, that's one of the sports where it's like, yeah.  That was the year where they had to have a second job, I'm sure, right?  Yes.  Yes.  So he was talking about like every year he didn't want to go to a training camp and shit.  He was like, I hate training.  So he would kind of call in sick.  But one year they called in and they were negotiating his contract at the same time.  And he was letting them know, like, I might not be coming back.  And he's like, tell him I'm painting the barn.  And so, because he had a farm and stuff. 
[00:45:00]  And everyone imagined the barn must be like massive or something.  It was a tiny shed.  He just didn't want to go train.  And finally they brought him in.  And so he's a sweet guy.  Comes across well.  But it's like, whenever I see that dude talking, whenever I think about a character like that  in terms of my movie hits somebody, boom, it's immediately Norton.  So he's in there.  Sweet dialogue.  Wonderful scene where you vomit through the whole thing.  That was a charming aspect of Glenn Hall.  He was notorious for having a weak stomach.  Like the game made him nervous.  So before every game he would be puking his guts up. 
[00:45:30]  Wow.  And they tell like a story that like he says is he's going, it's not a true story.  He's going, but they've told it so long that people think it's true.  But they always tell the story of they're in the middle of a game.  He put his hand up and the refs just paused the game.  And he just walked, just skated over to the boards.  It was like.  Everybody waited and stuff.  And then he waved and they went right back to the game.  And he's in an interview I saw.  He's like, that didn't happen.  Sweet dude.  That's what he looks like now, huh?  1924.  Rep puts me up 86 years old.  That's not him, is it?  That's not him. 
[00:46:00]  No.  That is a Glenn Hall.  Yeah, that's another guy.  Put in Mr. Goalie.  That looks like Popeye.  Yeah.  When are you starting to shoot that, Kev?  End of the year, it looks like.  End of the year.  All right.  Getting closer.  It keeps getting longer and longer.  And then I'm like, God, is this a movie?  Or is it two movies?  Is it something else?  That's him.  So there he is.  That's him.  He weighed on a poor team while there was lots of action around.  And that's what you enjoyed about the game.  A little bit, right?  Yeah.  Glenn Hall joined the Detroit Red Wings.  Were here in Rookie of the Year honors in 1956 with 12 shutouts. 
[00:46:30]  Pause that real quick.  And introduced.  This is Legends of Hockey, which is this amazing series.  If you like hockey at all, pick it up.  I get blazed and watch this, man.  I swear.  One of my favorite things to do in life.  I think, I don't know if this is true for anybody else, but when you try to make people  laugh for a living, is there something really cathartic about crying?  And I'm not saying like crying like, oh, I'm miserable.  Just something, an emotional release.  I get fucking baked and watch Legends of Hockey and ball my eyes. 
[00:47:00]  Really?  Oh, my God, dude.  The music they play under these things.  Holy shit.  It's crazy.  Like, I watch that.  I watch, do you ever see Broad Street Bullies, the HBO doc?  Of course.  Amazing.  Dude, I don't even like the Flyers, man.  But I'll get baked and watch that.  And by the end, I'm like fucking bawling.  My wife will be like, are you okay?  I'm like, this is so beautiful.  They love that team so much.  So this is my favorite pastime, man.  It's mostly like, that's how I wrote Hit Somebody.  Blaze out, watch these videos, get real emotional and start fucking writing.  Were you always emotional like that? 
[00:47:30]  No, I think that's midlife.  Midlife, yeah, yeah.  I think it's the older one gets, the more comfortable one gets, at least in my case.  Like the younger Kevin Smith would be like, shut up, faggot.  Yes.  The younger Kevin Smith would be like, stop saying that you cried.  And the older Kevin Smith goes the other way.  I'm like, no, it's totally okay to cry.  Particularly if you're not crying because you're miserable.  Particularly because you're crying because you're like, oh, man.  We're just some kind of a...  Finding beauty in the mundane, man.  That'll bring me to tears sometimes.  It is odd to get emotional and feel like tears welling up from like a musical note from a song. 
[00:48:00]  Like a big...  So manipulative.  A big like, bump, like live.  It might sound a little fruity, but if you see like a big harmony ending of a Broadway fucking play thing.  Yeah.  And it's like, what?  And it's like, why am I feeling like that?  Why am I feeling like that?  They watch it a few days like that.  It's dialed in.  It's not even a story or anything.  It's just the way it sounds.  It's like, if it's rent, we know why you're feeling that way. 
[00:48:30]  Anybody who's been following me for the last month or two months, whether podcasts or appearances,  are probably sick to death of me talking about it.  But sometimes you find something you fucking love and you just advocate it from now to next year or two until you're on to the next thing.  I saw Book of Mormon.  Anyone see Book of Mormon?  They all did.  They loved it.  Fucking brilliant, isn't it?  Loved it.  Amazing.  This is what it did to me.  And I would love to find out if you guys reacted the same way.  Creative people, I think, tend to always be like, I dare you. 
[00:49:00]  Because, you know, if you write or create for a living, you're just like, all right, well, I know.  I've seen every fucking trick.  Let me see your trick.  I'm sitting in the front watching that.  Like, my arms cross.  First minute of that play when they do the kind of frozen scene.  And I'm like, oh, if it's going to be this triptych shit the whole time, this guy at fucking Tony, I was like, fucking god damn it.  30, 45 seconds.  Arms crossed.  And I'm like, you're not getting in.  By the moment they fucking drop and jump into, like, drop the triptych going to, hello, you're melting. 
[00:49:30]  The arms drop.  Yeah.  You know, and suddenly you're just like, oh, my God, this is wonderful.  This is amazing.  Somebody cracked the code.  To me, it's my favorite thing that anyone has ever made in the history of mankind.  Wow.  It's bridges.  Work of art.  Fucking islands.  It doesn't matter.  It is a fucking masterpiece.  Yes.  I mean, some people look at me and say, like, would you stop talking about it?  Like, you see something that good.  You just want to be like, oh, my God.  You want to pass it on?  It's fucking, it is a masterpiece.  I saw it twice in the same week. 
[00:50:00]  I saw it twice as well.  I flew fucking back to New York to see it, man.  Just to see it again.  Took my kid.  I was just like, I had to come back for a meeting, of course.  And I was, I'd been telling my kid about it and singing the songs and shit because a lot of cursing in the songs.  Like, oh, fuck the baby.  And the kid's like, what?  So I said, hey, man, I'm going back to New York.  You want to take a ride with me and we'll fucking go see Book of Mormon?  She was like, shit, yeah.  So I went back like a week, week and a half later.  And I was supposed to go Saturday.  I bought tickets for my brother and his husband were coming up.  I said, come see Book of Mormon.  Because when I was watching, I was like, my brother would love this. 
[00:50:30]  It's so gay friendly.  It's crazy.  It's humane.  It's human friendly.  That's the beautiful thing about that show is, like, it offends everybody and at the same time leaves space for anybody's fucking belief.  It is.  It's a wonder.  A thing of wonder.  You watch it work with the precision of a fucking open Swiss watch and you're just like, my hat's off to you.  By the end of that show, I sit there going, fuck it.  I quit.  You know what's the point, man?  It's encouraging that they worked for three years on it.  They didn't just fucking bang it out.  Yes.  Three years they worked.  Oh, my God.  And it fucking shits all over Mormonism. 
[00:51:00]  And in a way, it doesn't.  It kind of vindicates them as, like, very human.  And, you know, you saw it.  I loved it.  And they're very fucking, they're not mean people.  They're well-intentioned people.  And it's like, it's hard to hate them after that.  It's a, like, while I don't even, I wouldn't even go so far as to say they shit on Mormonism.  They never cross that line.  They present it with a kind of wry smile.  Right.  But they're never just like, this is horseshit.  Right, right, right.  But at the same time, the indication is just like, although we're talking about Mormonism here,  this goes for everything across the board. 
[00:51:30]  It is, aside from being brilliantly funny and fucking sing-along wonderful,  and it's a fucking flat-out, full-blown show, right?  It's not like, it's no joke.  No.  Fucking dancing, tapping, fucking singing and whatnot.  It's a really wonderful story about religion.  Like, you watch this thing and you're like, oh, my God, this is the story of fucking religion.  Like, none of it's fucking.  Jimmy and I love the turn it off.  Yeah.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Oh, God, it's so fucking fun.  We had them in.  We had a bunch of those guys in.  And that's the only time we heard. 
[00:52:00]  Like Andrew Rannells and Josh Gad.  Rannells was in.  Pretty much all of them.  And Gad was in.  And fucking Michael Potts.  And fucking, did you know, are you a wire fan or no?  I got geeky for a fucking cast.  Are you a wire fan?  Yeah, yeah.  So I didn't know he, I didn't know he was fucking, you know, Michael Potts was in the  wire.  As?  Brother Mazzone.  That's Brother Mazzone?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Now I'm thinking about it because I was talking to him backstage and I'm looking at him and  I'm sitting there going like, well, it must be because, you know, he's the guy that was  like, you know, Joseph Smith, do not fuck up, baby. 
[00:52:30]  So immediately I'm looking at him going, you're famous because I just watched you do that fucking  thing that made me laugh.  But now that you said I'm putting glasses on him in my head, it's just fucking his own.  Holy shit.  You can go online.  Yes.  There he is.  There's one performance of it online.  It's from the Tonys.  And it's just, it's Andrew Rannells and Rannells and the guy who played the fucking, I believe.  I believe it.  General butt fucking naked.  Butt fucking naked, yeah.  And it's really good.  I believe it's from the Tonys and it's really a fucking, you can just get a sense of the 
[00:53:00]  vibe.  Oh, it is.  It's a good indicator.  I watched that.  You become a nerd for things that you're kind of into and you start looking them up and  whatnot.  And it's true.  That is like the only real clip you could see.  So.  This dude's fucking amazing.  He's awesome.  Andrew Rannells.  And he looks like a little, like a plastic toy in this play.  He's so perfect with his hair.  To be teaching of Christ across the sea.  But I allowed my faith to be shaken.  Oh, what's the matter with me? 
[00:53:30]  I've always longed to help the needy.  To do the things I never dared.  This was the time for me to step up.  So then why was I so scared?  A warlord who shoots people in the face.  What's so scary about that?  I must trust that my Lord is mightier and always has my back.  Now I must be completely devout.  I can't have even one shred of doubt. 
[00:54:00]  Listen to this fucker's voice, man.  I believe that the Lord God created the universe.  I believe that he sent his only son to die for my sins.  And I believe that ancient Jews built boats and sailed to America.  Right now, the Mormon.  And the Mormon just moves. 
[00:54:30]  You cannot just believe.  Jump to the end, man.  Jump to when he, with the warlords there.  It's the moment in the play where the dude is,  hold on one sec, go back a little bit.  A little bit more.  A little bit more.  A little bit more.  Hold on.  Pause right there.  Moment in the show where the dude is like,  you know, it's the, of any musical, of Disney movie,  where the hero's like, I know my quest and shit.  So he's figuring out what he's going to do.  And he essentially goes to the camp of the warlord,  the Ugandan warlord, 
[00:55:00]  who's forcing castration on women in the village.  Clitoral circumcision.  Clitoral circumcision.  Shooting people in the fucking face.  And he's going to go convert them to Mormonism.  And the whole song, as you hear, is like that.  It's like, I believe.  And he's talking about the things he believes.  And then there's always this like weird Mormon belief  where you're like, is that what they believe?  And when he gets to this line,  this is like the crescendo of that entire song  in terms of like Mormon belief.  He busts into the general's camp to sing.  Go ahead. 
[00:55:30]  General!  We have an intruder.  He just walked right into camp.  I believe.  Pointing guns at him.  They're all pointing guns at him.  I believe.  I believe.  That the Lord God has sent me.  And I believe.  That in 1978, God changed his mind about black people.  You can be a Mormon. 
[00:56:00]  A Mormon who just believes.  This is the general.  What the f*** is this?  It's not a big part of this.  I'm good at it.  It's wrong.  All of a sudden, the dude is just singing,  belting it out.  That cuts in.  He's just like, what the f*** is this?  What the f*** is this?  It is like, it's unfair to say.  It's like, oh, it's like South Park come to life  because the boys, you know, work on that.  Certainly, yeah.  And also the fellow from Avenue Q did it.  It's beyond that.  It's, it's...  We loved it.  I don't like musicals in general.  I hate musicals, too.  I really don't, man.  I'm dying to see this again with this cast. 
[00:56:30]  Reynolds is amazing.  They're all f***ing...  One of these guys going away and they're bringing in the new guys.  This Saturday, what I had tickets for this Saturday  was the one-year anniversary, I think, of the run or something like that.  That's not that bad.  They could do a couple years.  I wonder.  I wonder how long they're going to stick around.  They now start in the touring shows.  It starts in Chicago and then there's one going to L.A.  And Josh was on TV, I guess, out in L.A. to announce,  hey, Book of Mormon's coming.  But they were like, you going?  He's like, no, I'm not going to be in it.  So he's not in that one.  They're the New York cast, right?  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:57:00]  They're the hardcore originals in New York.  And fucking Nicky, what's your name?  Nicky St. James or Nicky?  Oh, my God, she's fucking awesome.  She was in, too.  Nice to look at.  She has.  Oh, she's a beautiful woman.  But what an incredible voice.  That song she sings, it's hysterical,  and it'll make you a little bit sad, bittersweet.  The Salt Lake City song, she belts it out like a Disney princess, man.  And the song is undercut with wonderful satire and whatnot  because she's singing about this golden place she'd love to be  other than this Ugandan hell she's in, and it's fucking Salt Lake City. 
[00:57:30]  And you're like, wow, man, I live, like, in a world where Salt Lake City exists,  and it's not nearly as romanticized as in that song.  You start thinking, like, oh, my God, we do live in a place where  there are other people who are like, I'll be in the worst part of where you are  compared to where I am right now.  Oh, it's fucking fantastic.  I love Kevin Smith because he spent his whole time talking about Book of Mormon  instead of his own book.  Instead of Book of Kevin Smith.  Yeah, that's true.  A book that he wrote.  It's called Tough Shot.  Yes.  We don't go for the salty language here, Kev. 
[00:58:00]  I mean, this gutter's talk may work where you're from.  Tough Shit is called Life Advice from a Fat, Lazy Slob Who Did Good.  I just added that part.  I was like, Jimmy!  It's fucking another book, dude.  Is this autobiographical or is it just observations?  This one is kind of part memoir, part, you know, the usual current day book.  Part memoir, part advice to him.  I wish we got it earlier than today,  but it looks like it's some shit that has happened to Kevin Smith.  There's a line.  It covers the last five years.  It's good.  The Bruce Willis shit's in there.  You got your Bruce Willis in here? 
[00:58:30]  Bruce Willis is in there.  Oh, shit.  Good.  Southwest Airlines is in there.  Red State's in there.  Smart Cast, Comic Book Men.  Tells the whole fucking story of the last few five years.  It's good.  It's really, really good.  I'm proud of it, man.  But if you're not a reader, I read the audio book, which was pretty fucking awesome.  I want that version.  It was dope, man.  And, you know, you have to, there's somebody there with you the whole time,  and every once in a while, they're like, a little more, a little more.  And you're like, oh, and you're like, fucking really put yourself into it.  You have to emote.  You can't just.  A little bit.  I was being directed. 
[00:59:00]  And then there's one on iBooks.  It's an enhanced version where it has the book,  but at the beginning of the book is a little video intro to each chapter  where I'm like, hey, man, welcome to the house.  And fucking in this version, in this chapter, we're going to talk about this.  That's cool.  It's kind of dope, man.  That's where it's going.  I mean, because the bookstores are closing, so it's harder to do signings.  So what are you going to do to get that?  You throw them a little bonus content so they watch the video and whatnot.  The nice thing about it is my dog just died.  Scully, my oldest dog.  And before she died, she was in one. 
[00:59:30]  I forgot, but one of the intros I shot was with her.  So I was looking at it, and I was like, oh, my God, she's there.  It's kind of sweet.  But the book, yeah, tough shit.  Very, very.  I think it's fine now.  How do you promote this on TV?  Honestly?  I say, I'll give you the exact TV rap because I've been doing it for a few days.  Hey, man, the easiest way we say it on TV is take a substitution.  Take my name, slam it in there, and we say Tough Smith.  And they go, oh.  Oh, look at you.  So at TV, Tough Smith, I call it.  You're going to be doing Imus in a few minutes, right?  Oh, yeah, heading over to Imus.  Hey, Kevin from Connecticut wants in here. 
[01:00:00]  Kevin, we're talking to Kevin Smith.  What's up, buddy?  Hi, Kevin.  Good morning, sir.  How are you?  Good.  Have you seen the movie Coon?  I did.  I did.  I rented it on iTunes a couple weeks ago.  I really liked it.  I definitely enjoyed it.  I mean, you know, I like Sean, obviously.  I've worked with him twice and whatnot.  It's a movie about hockey, so I'm predisposed to like his movie about hockey enforcer,  which is the most romantic aspect of the game, so I'm inclined to like that.  But I'm making a movie about a hockey enforcer, so naturally I was a little interested. 
[01:00:30]  And when I saw it, I was absolutely relieved.  They went for Slapshot, and that's great.  God bless.  I would never go for Slapshot because I can't do it.  Slapshot, Slapshot.  But if I was going to go for any George Roy Hill film, it would be not Slapshot.  It would be The World According to Garp.  So the hockey movie I'm making is more like The World According to Garp.  I'm glad that they went for Slapshot.  I enjoyed it.  There's funny stuff in it.  The guy who plays the goalie is the dude who is in the filmmaker's other works.  He made a movie called Fubar and a sequel to that. 
[01:01:00]  And he's got the wonderful moment where he's just like, two rules.  One, don't touch my Percocets.  And number two, do you have any Percocets?  He was good, man.  Yeah, it's totally worth getting.  It's on VOD.  You could peep it out now.  Any hockey movie deserves to be.  Yeah, I really liked it too there, Kevin.  You know, one thing I noticed about it is take a look at Ross the Boss Ray and take a look at Jay Miller, the goon from the Bruins in the 90s or even 2000s.  Identical.  Really?  Do you think that's the look you went for?  Lee of Schreiber. 
[01:01:30]  Every once in a while you have a movie where you're like, where the fuck like this dude is?  Square peg, round hole.  Not in a bad way, but like Lee of Schreiber and Sean William Scott have a tete-a-tete scene in a bar in this movie,  which is wholly outside of another movie, not in a bad way, but it's just not like, it's definitely elevated over the rest of the picture.  It's a wonderful little dramatic piece where Lee of Schreiber drops fucking signs.  He's the voice behind 24-7 on HBO.  He's the narrator voice.  He was the narrator voice of the Broadway, Broad Street Bullies, that documentary I was talking about. 
[01:02:00]  So he's obviously some sort of hockey enthusiast.  He plays this dude, Ross the Boss.  Yeah, he was great.  That fucking scene in the diner or the bar, whatever it is, is wonderful where he's just like, I will lay you the fuck out.  And he's got the accent and everything.  He's got a down with that whacked out mustache too, man.  Totally.  It's definitely worth peeping out.  He's fucking good.  I like that guy.  Yeah, I've seen him.  Lee of Schreiber?  Yeah, yeah.  He's wonderful.  He's in one of my favorite TV movies of all time.  HBO did this thing called RKO 287 about the making of Citizen Kane. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, really?  And he plays Orson Welles.  He's really fucking, really intense.  He's really good and good too.  He's not in it a lot, but he certainly gets a great performance.  No, he's in it very little, but for what he's in, it's astounding.  He steals the show.  And even the fight scene at the end, you know, you get to movies, fight scenes, and generally they're kind of bullshit.  With the exception of the ankle thing, which looked very weird.  Their fight on ice was pretty damn...  Fuck yeah.  Yeah, it was authentic.  It felt kind of good.  It didn't feel like the young blood fight.  Yeah, and they didn't hold back.  They're showing the teeth flying out, the blood. 
[01:03:00]  So much blood in this movie going.  My God.  He played Ricky Romo in the fucking Broadway version of Glenn Gary, Glenn Ross that I saw.  Oh, really?  With Alan Alda.  Liam Schreiber?  Really?  Tom Wolpat, yeah.  Who did Alan Alda play?  He played Shelley.  Good luck with the book, Kevin.  Hey, thank you so much, sir.  He played Shelley the Machine.  Yeah, although he was good, but he made a weird character choice, which was still good, but I preferred Lemon's version.  Can you break it down in a nutshell what his character choice was?  Um, he kind of talked, uh, almost like Mike Bloomberg, from what I can remember, a weirder... 
[01:03:30]  I don't really know.  What are you talking about?  Like, he was just a weirder...  Yeah.  I mean, I'm not sure.  It was just a weirder version of...  Do you think he does that because he's like, everybody has Jack Lemmon burn in their brain,  so I might as well try anything to...  I don't know.  Anything else.  He's like, can I do this in the Darth Vader voice?  Anything.  To bring something new to it.  Right.  My favorite moment in Lemon is when he takes the fucking lemon drop or whatever, and he  throws it in his mouth.  Oh, yeah.  He doesn't put it in his mouth.  He tells him, like, you know, you're an asshole, and he throws it in his mouth, and I'm like,  he threw a lemon drop in his mouth. 
[01:04:00]  It's fucking great.  To punctuate his fucking, his killing sentiment.  I'm really going out on a limb saying that was a fantastic movie.  Oh, my God.  Was that great?  That's one of those movies you pop in and you go to sleep to because, A, you know it so well.  B, the dialogue's like fucking rhythmic music and shit.  Oh, so I'm sure this is a great movie.  They're telling us we've got to get you out of here, man.  Yeah, you really have to go over to Dom Imus.  Thank you for having me in, man.  Imus in the morning, we have Kevin Smith.  I'm going to close my eyes.  Holy shit.  Creepily real.  Come back if you want, man.  We're here.  If you guys got the time and you guys don't have anybody coming in, I'll roll back. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, come in.  We got Bob Kelly, and you'll fit in perfectly.  Do Imus and come back if you can.  If not, we understand.  Okay.  I'll go for it.  I'll figure it out right after I walk out of the building.  This book I will be reading.  Tough Shit.  Life Advice from a Fat, Lazy Slob who did good.  It's good.  It's been selling pretty darn well, man.  I like that your face is good.  You can make like Kevin Smith face.  Yes.  You can just go, hey.  With the front of the book, you can put it over you.  I'm Kevin Smith.  This is what I hate about the book.  I fucking put it up next to me, and people are like, hey, you gained some weight since  I'm like, shut the fuck up. 
[01:05:00]  Put the book down.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks, Kevin Smith.  Thanks, Kevin.  Serious XM.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, boy.  I think this might be getting topical with Sexy.  No, it ain't.  Oh, it's not?  All right.  Good.  I want to thank Kevin Smith for stopping by.  He might come back after the Imus thing. 
[01:05:30]  Imus was bitching and complaining.  I just checked my Twitter.  About what?  After the Kevin Smith thing.  And I guess Imus does the pre-interview.  We don't really do the pre-interview here.  Nah.  We do the pre-come.  We do the pre-come.  Right.  And I guess Imus wanted Kevin Smith to come up with his five favorite songs, and he only  came up with four.  And then he read only the first page of Kevin's book, and he hates it.  Yeah.  Not hates it.  What did he say?  I don't even know what it's about.  I just, whatever. 
[01:06:00]  It seems he's just writing and babbling about it.  It says, first page of book is bad.  What?  He's such an asshole.  That's just Imus.  I'm a curmudgeon.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What the hell is a curmudgeon?  Right, Imus?  Why?  The book starts off with, I am a product of Don Smith's balls.  We just had him on our show.  Oh.  Let's pop him.  Oh, we can't pop him on quick.  Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.  Why can't we?  Because it's not over there.  Can we still?  When it's over here, I can't pop it on.  But if it's over there, I can pop it on. 
[01:06:30]  Well, can you just change the channel?  Put it on.  I don't know how to change the channel.  Ah, that's that rear shot that Kevin said he hates.  Oh, shit.  I guess they weren't listening at Fox Business, huh?  That is a fryer tuck.  We still can't just pop off the fucking TV.  No, if it's over there, we can't.  But over here, we can't.  Over there.  It's got to be over there.  It's over here now.  It's got to be over there.  But it's over here now.  Can we put it over there?  Oh, there it is.  We always say Tough Smith.  I slap my name.  Hey, we heard that.  Tough Ship?  That could work.  But Tough Smith is easier because critics have usually equated my name with that S word. 
[01:07:00]  So it works in this instance of the book.  Life advice from a fat, lazy slob who did good.  Hey, man, those are fighting words.  Oh, hey.  I don't think of you.  Yes.  You think of yourself as a geek.  Wasn't he just here?  Very much so.  Yeah, I don't.  Yeah.  Well, you don't know me that well.  You don't hang out when I watch the X-Files and cry going, the truth is out there.  That's geeky.  Yeah, but see, we think of you as cool.  I got that guy.  I could only have sex with that guy if I wanted to.  I was just like, someone made it from the guy I was dead. 
[01:07:30]  That's my man.  Nat, first page of your book.  Yes.  That's very tough for not only me to read, but your parents.  Why?  Why?  Tell them what it is without saying what it is.  I know you can't, but.  Well, he talks about his father's testicles.  Yes.  That's my origin point.  That's where I came from.  That's where we all came from.  Not my dad's, but everyone came from their dad's.  That they hadn't received their due.  Yes.  That they hadn't, they hadn't, no, no, they hadn't, no shout out to dad's testicles. 
[01:08:00]  They hadn't been lionized in print.  Yes.  Yeah.  And I talk about the fact that as much as I'm sure he enjoys having them in print, I can't  take it much further, but it has to do with my mother.  And she saw that part of the book.  She asked me, she goes, what's it about?  I told her, what's it about?  I told her, what's it about?  She goes, what's it about?  It's been the last five years of my life.  We have no reigns here.  Why not?  We're just listening to Ima's.  We're simulcasting.  I just realized what we're doing.  I'm really enjoying Kevin Smith.  Don't you get so, like, caught up in shit like that? 
[01:08:30]  No.  Like, it's just someone else's show, and we're listening, not realizing, oh, we're  doing a show.  I just feel it's an extension of our Kevin Smith interview.  I ought to work out a new Ima's, because it seems to have gotten a lot higher.  It's still kind of like Ima's, but it's a lot higher than it used to be.  It used to be Don Ima's, Ima's in the morning program.  Now he's like, hey, Kevin, what are you doing?  The first page of your book is like Ima's.  See, that's why we did it. 
[01:09:00]  Now we got a bit out of it.  I don't know.  They're probably pumping.  I never re-upped my.  They're probably pumping pure oxygen into the studio for them.  I think I'm feeling them.  We were on the road last week.  We were down in Orlando, and she went to the show.  And, you know, the show's very frank and candid and whatnot and a lot of blue language,  and she's used to it by now.  In the beginning, my mom would get very like, I just want to hear Ima's again.  I know.  And then we can move on.  Sure.  I think I raised you to curse, and she didn't.  My mother was a non-cursor.  You know, she wouldn't even say hell.  She'd be the woman that'd be like, oh, H-E double hockey sticks and whatnot. 
[01:09:30]  It took me a long time to equate that with a pictogram to be like, well, that's a cuss word.  So she's, cursing wasn't really encouraged in my home, but I saw Karlin Carnegie when I was 11 years old, 10 or 11 years old.  And George Karlin still remains the smartest person.  I'm done, Imus.  You've done it again.  I just want to hear the new Ima's again.  Kevin's giving a long answer right here.  Thinker, one of the most original minds. 
[01:10:00]  He would curse like a sailor.  Like, this man was respected and respectable.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my goodness.  George Karlin was not lazy.  He was brilliant.  So from a young age, I was like, if this guy can work salty language into whatever he's doing and not feel like dumb.  Oh, my God. 
[01:10:30]  Politicians, I don't know anybody did.  Or astronauts when I was a kid.  I looked up.  Still answering the question.  Misamaglue, misamaglue.  People who got to, like, basically be themselves for a living, open up their mouths and talk, man, create theater of the mind, create imagery for people through the words and whatnot.  So that's something that always captures my imagination.  My way to all that was film.  Like, you know, I didn't know how to get there.  I was like, let me make some films.  And it opened up the door to doing stuff like standing out there and talking about the work.  Or years later, it's like, you've got enough people who like your work, you can start podcasting. 
[01:11:00]  And they'll follow that.  We do a bunch of, as you know, spodcast.com.  So he, George Karlin, I would say paved the way for me.  And whenever anybody says, like, why do you curse so much?  Which is my mother sometimes.  I'll immediately point to Karlin.  I was like, George Karlin cursed his entire life.  Get in there.  Jump in.  And he was a genius.  So I'm emulating genius.  He was like a regular on this program.  And every time he would come on, he'd bring his computer with him.  And he'd sit there.  He always was prepared to the max.  Like he prepared every time he was on. 
[01:11:30]  In fact, he would tell me like it was one of his HBO specials.  Yeah.  He was.  He'd prepare like one of his HBO specials.  George Karlin was a road hog.  Fucking Mr. McHugh.  I'm in.  So.  That's great.  Oh, isn't it?  Great.  Oh, no.  Eh.  So it's a new high-pitched Imus in the morning program. 
[01:12:00]  Eh.  Oh.  Oh.  Eh.  He's just like moaning into the mic like Imus.  I'm going to be doing this all day.  Stands up and he just begins effortlessly advertising lullaby.  Uh-huh.  All right.  So that's what Imus is doing now, I guess.  Oh, God.  That's fun.  It is.  Oh, God.  Hey, uh, we got a city council out there in L.A. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, this is getting out of fucking control.  Um, remember the Krakow guys?  Yep.  Oh, the Krakow guys were, uh, the Whitney Houston.  The name of the show?  The Krakow guys in the morning?  The Krakow guys in the morning.  In the morning, Krakow guys.  Krakow guys!  Eh!  There are two guys out there in L.A. doing radio and the Whitney thing comes down and,  uh, you know, trying to entertain their audience and maybe get a little humor in there.  They called Whitney Houston a Krakow.  Yeah.  Who cares? 
[01:13:00]  So what?  But everyone's up in arms.  Up in arms.  They wanted them fired.  They got suspended.  Uh, I guess the company, the radio company did the right thing as far as not firing these guys.  And, uh, unfortunately that's not enough, I guess, huh?  Not enough.  Headline, city council warns Krakow comments intolerable, calls for diversity in talk radio.  This is such a fucking, uh, a travesty, if you will.  It's more, it's more phony liberal outrage because it's about, it's gonna be like that 
[01:13:30]  fucking fairness doctrine.  Yep.  That's what they're trying to push through because for whatever reason, they're fucking  not getting, they, they feel like their talk radio is not being represented.  Right.  It's, they have, it's just, it's, uh, I can't even talk about it anymore.  It's exhausting, right?  It's infuriating.  It makes me so sick to my fucking stomach.  Ann and I were talking about this this morning before the show and I told Ann, I go, I stopped  breathing because that's how like fucking infuriated I get.  I actually stopped breathing when Ann was talking about this to me this morning. 
[01:14:00]  It's so angering that it's gotten to the point now where they're actually trying to  legislate free speech.  Just like Canada, we're gonna have just what fucking Canada has up there with what is hate  speech and inappropriate, where you're not allowed to, where you're not allowed to say  it anymore.  Yeah, you're just not allowed.  And, and under the guise of diversity, diversity is supposed to be, uh, all different takes on  things, different opinions, different lifestyles, and, uh, all coming together in a diverse manner.  Their idea of diversity, or at least they're trying to present it as diversity, is their 
[01:14:30]  own point of view and opposing points of view that they find offensive have to be eliminated.  Right.  That is the opposite of diversity.  Right.  That's not the definition of diversity.  The exact opposite of it.  I told you, diversity means allowing guys to call Whitney Houston a crack hoe.  Right.  And then you have another radio station going, you hear those assholes calling Whitney Houston  a crack hoe?  Right.  A diverse, uh, opinion of that.  That's true diversity.  Right.  And you allow all this.  Yeah.  And all the dummies out there, you fucking dummies that were emailing me about Rush Limbaugh, 
[01:15:00]  oh no, that's the free market at work!  Yeah.  Is this now the free market at work?  It's the free market at work!  It is so sorry!  Oh, eh, oh, eh.  I'm sorry.  Here's where it goes, stupid assholes.  Is this the free market too?  Them legislating that?  All you guys out there that couldn't see how this is a free speech issue.  The company's got the right to fire us!  This is where it's going, you dumb motherfuckers.  Yeah.  This is where it's going. 
[01:15:30]  Now it's not just the company doing it, it's because that catches steam, and now it's not  allowed.  Right.  It's not going to be allowed for you to say that.  So all you dopes out there that were making a free market argument when we told you no,  it's a free speech issue.  Yeah.  It is a free speech issue.  Just because they're not putting you in jail doesn't mean that it's not a free speech  issue, you dopes.  And this is why you have to fight every single incident.  Because they don't go away, they go to the next thing.  I'm not a fan of Rush Limbaugh, but I didn't even have a doubt in my mind that I had to 
[01:16:00]  stand up and support his right to say what he said.  God, it's so obvious to me.  Yeah.  City council members took a step closer on Wednesday, this is getting scary out there  in L.A., to becoming the first in the nation to adopt a resolution condemning certain types  of speech on public airwaves.  Yeah.  This isn't even FCC shit.  Or is it just condemning it or is it controlling it?  Like, what will they expect to be done?  Let's see.  And by the way, what groups are behind this?  They sound like a very diverse organization. 
[01:16:30]  It says L.A. City Council close to resolution barring radio hosts from racist, sexist comments.  Council member Jan Perry introduced legislation that would call upon media companies to ensure  on-air hosts do not use or promote racist and sexist slurs on radio and other broadcasts.  This has nothing to do with the FCC.  This is why this is a major fucking problem.  But no, no, no, dude, it's not free speech.  It's the free market at work.  No, no, it's not a free speech issue.  Right.  No, all you dummies that couldn't see it because you hate Rush. 
[01:17:00]  No, it's not a free speech.  It's the free market at work.  It's the free market.  They have the same right.  You fucking idiots.  You deserve what you...  I almost hope they pass it because it's not going to affect me.  I almost hope they pass it so you fucking dumbbells can drive more people to satellite  and you can have your castrated, horrible, regular radio.  Well, the problem is, you know, this shit is all going to eventually get to satellite.  You know, it'll take a while still. 
[01:17:30]  We got some breathing room here, but I'm telling you, they're not going to stop.  They're not going to call it hate speech.  They're not going to call it whatever.  On TV, they don't...  No, no.  You look at network TV and then you look at cable.  Well...  Cable still does what it wants.  I mean, like HBO and the premium channels.  I would like to think like you, but I don't know, man.  This is a pay service.  It's much, much harder.  We'll see.  I hope you're right.  Members of Black Media Alliance, National Hispanic Media,  Korea Coalition, Korean American Bar Association,  American Indians in Film and TV.  We're on hand to voice their support for the proposal.  Sure, of course. 
[01:18:00]  That's good.  That's diverse.  Yeah, very diverse.  Groups that name themselves by their ethnicity.  Right.  And that fucking annoying, well, we have to because we're the minority  and we're fighting back enough with that argument.  Where's Whitey?  Where do white people at?  The resolution, which was also supported by council members Bernard Parks  and council president, Herb Wesson, called attention to the recent uproar  over comments by KFI, talk show host John and Ken there.  John and Ken were suspended if they called the late pop singer Whitney Houston  a crack hoe three days after her death in February. 
[01:18:30]  You fucking dopes.  It was meant to entertain and maybe make some people laugh.  And who cares if they think she was a crack hoe?  She was fucking known for ruining her career from getting high.  Everybody knew she was fucking partying.  And so what?  You address it improperly?  The problem is that she was doing dope all these years  and she fucking wrecked her career, stupids.  And when people say crack hoe, it's almost cartoonish, too.  It really is.  Yeah, that word crack hoe.  Crack hoe's been around forever.  And say hoe, unless you're black or a black woman, 
[01:19:00]  like a fucking, what we can call her place, her production company,  One Hoe Productions, because she's black and it's acceptable.  Wait, she did?  Yes.  Holy fuck.  One Hoe Productions.  I did not know that.  Of course.  That was her production company or the name of her.  Yes.  The hypocrisy.  It's embarrassing.  I was going to go with members of the Black Media Alliance.  They're involved here, right?  Oh, yeah, of course.  Are they paying attention to what's on the rap channels out there in L.A.?  And obviously they should be allowed to play whatever fucking music they want  as long as it doesn't break any FCC regulations. 
[01:19:30]  So they're going to ignore that where the word hoe is used left and right in song?  Yep.  Fucking dopes.  Sure.  The hypocrisy there is crazy.  It's infuriating.  And they've fucked with rap, too.  They've gone after rap and Sharpton's gone after rap.  Yeah, but it goes away.  But it does go away.  Because they know how powerful and how much money that brings in.  They're not going to get anywhere with that shit.  But they're going to get to some of these radio companies that are going to be scared.  Scared.  Scared.  The proposal cites a long history of racially offensive comments as well as deplorable sexist 
[01:20:00]  remarks.  Really?  Where?  Where's the long history?  Every once in a while, one pops up.  And it's justified every time in my head.  And who's really listening that gets outraged?  But the free market, wouldn't that just determine that nobody listens to them because they don't  like those remarks?  Yeah.  So if those remarks are being seen as funny by people and resonating with people, then  why shouldn't they be allowed?  Right.  Right.  If those remarks are obviously getting ratings, and you're not calling on someone to go out 
[01:20:30]  and commit violent acts or to commit a rape, then why would you, in a diverse society,  want to remove that opinion instead of just offering an alternate opinion?  Get rid of it.  Get rid of it.  That's the free market at work.  Certainly don't use the word diversity.  No.  Certainly don't use it.  It's the opposite of diversity.  The proposal cites a long history, okay, and remarks particularly towards women in  black, Latino, and Asian communities at KFI 640 and calls for parent company Clear Channel  to hire a more diverse workforce to offset the trends.  Mob tech.  It's just trying to get more people hired. 
[01:21:00]  It's bullshit.  Of course.  It's phony outrage.  But I hope the phones are lighting up, by the way, with the same people that called  about how it was fucking the free market at work.  Nope.  So I would like to know where you guys are that made that dumb argument because you hate Rush.  You'll be all over Twitter later.  Why don't you call us right now?  Yeah.  It is easy to become desensitized to what other groups find intolerable with ultimately  fosters an environment where negative comments can go unchecked and corporate guidelines  and policies are no longer being forced.  Forced.  Enforced.  They say it fucking fosters an environment where. 
[01:21:30]  That's the fucking phrase that segues them from we don't like it into this is why it  can't be allowed.  Because you can't just say I don't like it.  It can't be allowed.  That's fucking too revealing.  Too self-centered.  Yes.  So you have to connect those things.  And that's the fucking shitty little verbal segue because it fosters an environment in  which and then you can go anywhere you want with it.  Will this be passed?  Probably not because it's way too arbitrary.  It's way too up for interpretation just like pornography is. 
[01:22:00]  But in Canada they do have it.  Right.  Their fucking free speech up there on the radio is despicable.  But I'd like to think that our First Amendment is a little better than Canada's as far as  their freedom of speech goes.  It's very difficult to legislate against freedom of speech.  It used to be a lot better.  Oh, I know.  I know.  We've lost a lot of ground in the First Amendment in this country.  I know.  We have.  It's fucking ridiculous.  Of course she is.  Of course. 
[01:22:30]  Of course she is.  The Democrats, you know, say what you want.  The Republicans are awful with this fucking religion thing.  They stink.  And the sex stuff and wanting to save the children as far as, you know, for them hearing  something dirty.  But the Democrats and liberals are so fucked when it comes to political correctness and,  you know, saying things about sexuality and race and, you know, things they find homophobic  or racist.  It's people's opinions. 
[01:23:00]  Last night I was in a little Twitter battle with none other than a black girl was getting  involved, too, about this situation in Florida with the Trayvon.  It was Trayvon?  Yeah.  Trayvon.  And I was offering up my opinions.  I wasn't being offensive.  I was just debating people in a civil manner in 140 characters.  And apparently people thought I was going to get in trouble. 
[01:23:30]  For what?  They're like, what?  Exactly.  For what?  For even talking.  For being white.  And even discussing race.  The problem with the Trayvon situation is not what happened, because I think that he  was, that guy was fucking terrible to shoot him.  Mm-hmm.  And was wrong to shoot him.  Right.  From what I've heard.  From what I've heard.  It's the way the media, my only issue is the way the media paints it.  That's the only issue I have.  Not with the fucking, I understand people being outraged about it.  The guy really is walking home.  And apparently there's a phone call with his girlfriend where she was telling him just 
[01:24:00]  run.  Like, he really wasn't doing anything.  So I understand the outrage from people who are in that situation.  It's only the way the media covers it that makes me sick.  But now I've heard reports that he was being beat up by Trayvon.  Okay, I didn't know that.  Like, this is, and here's the deal.  But then again, 9-1-1 did tell him, stop following the guy.  But 9, here's what it is.  9-1-1 cannot dictate to you what you do.  They could suggest things.  Right, sure.  But once, like I was saying, 9-1-1 said that he shouldn't have done this. 
[01:24:30]  It's like, in self-defense cases, and I'm not saying this is self-defense.  I don't know what the circumstances were.  But they can't tell you what to do.  You have to be the judge of what you feel is best for you to do.  Now, they're saying that he wasn't arrested, and that's where the outrage comes from, which I think is bullshit.  If they did arrest him, there would still be outrage that this guy was killed.  But they didn't arrest him because the cops can't do a full investigation on the scene.  They see it as a self-defense case. 
[01:25:00]  It's presented as one.  Until the grand jury gets all this evidence, which I think they will, and I think they will indict this guy.  Yeah, I think so.  I really think they're going to indict this guy, and he's going to stand trial for this.  So calm down.  Fucking relax.  It's in the public eye.  You're all outraged.  But my point last night that no one was getting is not the fact that this happened.  It's wrong.  I agree it's wrong.  I agree.  If this kid was walking through the neighborhood and some guy shot him for no fucking reason, yeah, the guy should go to jail. 
[01:25:30]  They should investigate it.  It should go to trial.  The guy should go to jail.  But here's the problem.  There's such outrage when something like this happens, yet 10 innocent â€“ not innocent, but 10 people were shot â€“ were killed.  40 people were shot over the weekend in Chicago.  40 fucking people.  10 killed.  One, a six-year-old was killed.  Another young â€“ a child was wounded in that 40 shootings in Chicago.  So calling this out and making such a big deal of it is like trying to plug a leak in a pipe when a tsunami is coming. 
[01:26:00]  It doesn't â€“ they put more emphasis on the rare case of when it's not black-on-black crime, yet the black-on-black crime is so rampant that that should be addressed more.  But what is it â€“ like this is what I'm wondering.  Like the way they paint it and the way they show â€“ it's almost like what is happening that that's â€“ what need is that serving?  Because the media, again, is predominantly white. 
[01:26:30]  So what is the â€“ like what is the self-flagellation doing?  Not that it shouldn't be talked about for what it is.  I don't understand it.  But there's something happening like â€“ like literally we played that Kansas City report where the black kid set the white kid on fire and called him something.  And in the Kansas City report, they edited out what they said to him.  The fucking â€“ they edited out the fact â€“ they didn't mention the race.  Like I don't understand what is behind that.  Is it because there's â€“ is that the privilege of the ruling class to scold yourself? 
[01:27:00]  Like does that mean that white people are still really in charge and doing well?  When you spank yourself in front of everybody or you only spank other people that you deem the responsible ruling class,  is that a subtle form of dominance?  Like â€“  Right.  I don't understand what it is.  It couldn't be â€“ people couldn't be that stupid.  I don't know.  I don't know what the motive is there either.  I think it's elitism.  I think it's elitism from white people who don't even realize that they're fucking racist. 
[01:27:30]  That they're doing it.  And they don't even realize that they feel better than blacks and they feel like they're smarter and they feel like blacks need them.  Like I think that that racism is really subtle and really fucking ugly.  I think it's more dangerous than blatant racism.  Jesus Christ, at least blatant racism.  You know it's there and you can see it.  I was reading another story last night.  Apparently a couple of black guys beat the shit out of a cab driver as they were yelling racial epithets at the cab driver.  The prosecutor deemed it was not a hate crime and then said just because racial epithets are used during an assault does not necessarily make it a hate crime. 
[01:28:00]  Now, Fat Nick â€“ remember Fat Nick?  Of course.  He's still in prison for nothing more than beating a guy and yelling racial epithets.  That's all he did, yet that was considered a hate crime.  But when black people do it and yell racial epithets, for some reason it's not considered a hate crime. 
[01:28:30]  So what is it?  Like I know that and everybody sees that.  What is it â€“ what need is that serving?  Because people are doing it all over â€“ it's unspoken.  Oh, yeah.  They don't sit down and talk about this.  It's like I just cannot â€“ is it because they don't want to acknowledge that fucking black people really do have â€“ it's almost like white people don't want to acknowledge animosity towards them by black people.  It's like it almost makes you feel too guilty or too wrong to acknowledge the fact that, yeah, black people are fucking â€“ do have racial animosity towards whites. 
[01:29:00]  I don't think they want to be called out on it.  I think in recent years â€“ because the news used to report the race all the time.  It was described as a black male and â€“ but now I think the news sees that they just don't want to avoid problems.  If they present it and tell the race of the perpetrator, that particular group is going to come forward and go, why are you doing this? 
[01:29:30]  Why are you doing â€“ and they use thug tactics to keep the media from saying certain things.  But it's everywhere and it's every single media outlet.  I think it's deeper than that.  It's almost like how they say like all these generations of black people, like you're still feeling the effects of slavery and all that shit.  Like, you know, but I mean like â€“ or, you know, the â€“  Right. I've heard it.  You know â€“  I don't believe it, but I've heard it.  About being mistreated for all those years.  Right.  It's like a generational thing.  That's what this feels like.  It's this weird fucking mentality that white people â€“ I love â€“ besides missing Patrice because I love them so much. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I miss his brilliant takes on â€“ and he said it.  I never met a racist.  Yeah, yeah.  Why is â€“ nobody admits to having any racial feelings at all.  So they're not going to admit and acknowledge what's going on in their mentality, but I really think it is fucking people feeling like parents and scolding other people that they see as equals.  They won't scold somebody they see as lesser than, and they won't equally criticize somebody they see as lesser than. 
[01:30:30]  Do they feel like it's beating up on the person that can't defend themselves?  Well, it is â€“ you intellectually feel much more compelled to address another adult a certain way.  Like the way we talk to each other is a lot different than the way Oprah's going to talk to her son because that's a child.  Right.  And it's a very subtle form of feeling racially superior or feeling better than.  You might be onto something, Jimmy.  Yeah.  It's been driving me nuts for a long time.  Oh, it is really â€“  It's really confusing.  It's so hard to figure out where it comes from.  And it's not saying that blacks are not punished by the penal system. 
[01:31:00]  Believe me.  I get it.  They're treated like shit in a lot of cases.  I'm not saying that it's unfair that they're not arrested.  I'm only talking about the way it's reported and talked about in the press.  That's it.  Or the police â€“ I'm sorry.  Call her.  No, no, no, no, no.  I'm just trying to go through them because they still want to talk about the L.A. council thing.  That's all part of this.  That's all part of this.  It really is.  Yeah, this whole thing is â€“ it all comes together. 
[01:31:30]  Let's say hi to Joe in Fort Worth.  Joe.  Hey, man.  Hey.  Jimmy, I was going to let you know.  They said â€“ they pointed out how that guy said fucking coon on the 911 tape.  And it was just proving your point.  How did he bring that out?  He said what, buddy?  Well, have you heard the 911 tape?  I know I have not.  The Zimmerman called in and he said â€“ under his breath, he said fucking coon. 
[01:32:00]  Coon?  He pointed that out in the media.  Oh.  Yeah.  Now, everything.  I didn't hear that.  I mean, and again, it's not to say that this is not a national story and that this fucking  kid walking home should â€“ because I don't believe that the kid just charged with the  guy who pulled a pistol on him.  I mean, you know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because the girlfriend said that he sounded scared and like â€“  Yeah, this guy, again, the facts will come out and I think he will be indicted and, you  know, leave it at that.  But we don't see the same thing happening in other circumstances.  I posted probably five or six news stories that no one heard about that were black on 
[01:32:30]  white crimes that were fucking heinous, innocent white people.  It wasn't drug-related or some kind of thing where they knew the person.  Just innocent people that happen to be white and the perpetrators happen to be black but  you just never hear about it.  It's not reported as race crimes.  The race isn't reported of the person.  And the first thing that this story was was here you have a young black man who was just 
[01:33:00]  guilty of being black and he was shot and killed.  You don't have like, hey, here's the white couple who are being fucking killed and the  woman's being raped because they're white.  Why is that â€“ what is it that â€“  Mike.  We're not going to answer that today.  No, and again, a part of it is I think that what I said is it's the rule â€“ and it's  also, again, it's part of that subtle racism.  They deep, deep, deep down expect that from blacks. 
[01:33:30]  They expect it.  So when it happens, they don't think it's news.  It's almost like, well, you don't report when someone does what you know they're going  to do.  But it's almost like there is this shock that other whites can behave this way.  It's a really subtle form of feeling better than.  What were some of the examples at?  Oh, my God.  The crimes?  Yeah, you got some details on that?  Just the basic rapes.  All right, Coach.  Thank you, Mike.  I love a good â€“  There you go.  Sorry.  Yeah. 
[01:34:00]  Two guys killed â€“  Two black guys?  Yeah, two black guys killed a white guy that was a good Samaritan helping a woman during  a carjacking.  Okay.  You know, she was being carjacked and he stepped in and tried to help and they just fucking  shot him.  And that's not on the news?  No.  None of this was on the news.  Not to the same extent of this as this incident.  No, no.  It's just â€“ it's never seen as a race thing.  And these are all recent stories.  College student, girl, beautiful fucking nice blonde fucking beautiful girl raped and 
[01:34:30]  murdered by a black guy.  I mean, it just â€“ now, people are saying, why are you bringing race into it?  It's a crime.  Why are you bringing race?  I'm bringing race into it because people bring race into it when it's the other way around.  Now, they do.  That's â€“ like, a rape is a rape.  But if it's â€“  I like that.  Can I quote you on that?  But if it's in reverse, they do bring â€“ why are they more comfortable writing it that  way?  And that's all it is. 
[01:35:00]  It's â€“ it's â€“ again, it's fucking â€“ it's people who are just more comfortable.  I really think they're afraid of saying â€“ they never talk â€“ like, like, we have  with Patrice the Commander all the times I fucking argue with Keith Robinson and he's  an adamant fucking jackass.  But we are so honest with each other.  Right, right.  I'm not always right, but I always listen to those guys and I always voice my opinion.  Because white people are the only ones that could be racist.  Yeah, that seems to be â€“  A lot of people really think that.  I remember growing up thinking that, too, matter of fact.  That really seems to be.  So it was around me in such a way where I'm like, oh, only white people could be racist. 
[01:35:30]  And then you get a little older and you've been around the world a little bit and you  realize, holy fuck, everyone has racism in their fucking blood.  How about that story where it was the white guy and the black woman, they were married?  The marine couple?  The marine couple.  And black guys came in, raped the fuck out of her, killed the fuck â€“  Killed both of them.  Killed both of them.  Tried to set her on fire.  They tried to burn her.  Right.  They tried to fucking burn her, but they couldn't get the material left, so they killed her.  It was completely based on the fact that she was with a white guy. 
[01:36:00]  I mean, that was it.  But it never â€“ that was never really addressed.  They said a robbery gone fucking wrong.  Stop it.  Why â€“ is it fucking guilty white people washing themselves of what they think are  their own sins by not acknowledging those feelings towards them?  Now, you take it the other way around, white guys come in and kill a black and white couple,  it would absolutely be a hate crime and it was done just because of their race. 
[01:36:30]  And rightly so.  Of course.  If you're going to have hate crime legislation, that's probably when you should use it.  Yeah.  Yes.  But it's â€“ I now feel bad that I came in here with my hood up.  Fuck.  Ah, see?  That was a bad decision.  Ah, the hoodies.  Awkward.  The Million Hood Hoodie March last night.  How was it?  I think there was about 900 and fucking â€“ 999,000 people short.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Are there any black people calling in?  Like, I'm interested to hear â€“ because when you say this stuff, black people automatically  go, oh, they show black people in the media all the time. 
[01:37:00]  It's like, I'm not saying they don't.  No.  I'm not saying that they don't show black criminals, and I'm not saying â€“ maybe even  disproportionately.  I'm only saying that they don't mention racial motivation when it's black on white, and I  cannot for the life of me find out why.  Yeah, there's no black people today.  Yeah.  I don't think so.  And the proportion of white on black crime to black on white crime is â€“ it's a little  skewed.  Maybe that's why they see it as a rarity. 
[01:37:30]  I don't know.  I don't know.  But that's just it.  Like, so much is focused when the perpetrator is not black and the victim is black.  People get â€“ it gets so much attention.  And the black community comes out, and they're outraged and angered and want justice and want  this and that.  Meanwhile, like I said, 10 people were killed in Chicago, black on black crime.  And, you know, I know the rallies and the marches and everything, but that's bullshit. 
[01:38:00]  There's got to be a recognition and outrage to that that equals on the â€“ yes, statistically  rarer occasion that a white person or somebody that isn't black murders somebody that is black.  It just â€“ it's the disproportionate â€“ they're addressing something and being outraged at  something where there's like a giant problem here.  But they don't â€“  How about addressing the big problem? 
[01:38:30]  The thing is, it's the weird blinders.  Like, they don't ever â€“ because I've written to one reporter about it.  I was so aggravated.  And they don't acknowledge it.  Like, they don't know they're doing it almost.  Right, right.  Like, that's what drives me fucking crazy.  It's almost like this unspoken thing.  And I'm actually questioning myself, like, am I nuts?  Am I fucking crazy that I see this all the time?  Because we â€“ again, when you talk for a living, you kind of focus on stuff that is  speech or â€“ you know, it's whatever you do for a living.  You focus on that stuff and how it affects your job. 
[01:39:00]  So we watch this stuff as radio guys and as a comic.  You see â€“ it's like â€“ it's rolling downhill, rolling downhill, rolling downhill.  And I would notice it on Tough Crowd, the notes I would get.  They would always have the same tone or be from the same side of the fence.  They would never give a shit when I bash Christ or Christianity.  But if it was Islam, then it would â€“  Oh, yeah.  It was like you began to see this pattern.  And Colin feels crazy sometimes.  Oh, oh.  How was he in there?  Oh, okay.  Justice Department launches civil rights probe in the Martin death case. 
[01:39:30]  But then again, you know what?  Maybe that's the right thing because he wasn't â€“ maybe that's the right thing to do.  How about waiting for just the criminal â€“ how about just seeing if there are criminal charges here?  If he shot this kid without justification before this civil rights â€“ and it's to appease.  There's so many things that have done to appease people. 
[01:40:00]  They feel like they have to do something now, obviously, because there's so much attention being brought on here.  I don't know.  I think Jimmy's on to something as far as white people feeling like they're elitist.  Yeah.  And they don't know they do, though.  No, no.  No, it's not an obvious thing.  It's something just that's deep inside you, I think.  I never think it's that deep an issue.  I never think it goes that â€“ it gets that fucking intellectual and deep.  I think it's a very surface thing of people just being bullied into not mentioning race.  Nah, I think it's more than that. 
[01:40:30]  I'm kind of seeing Jimmy's way a little bit.  Because, again, when you talk to guys â€“ like, we had different relationships with guys because they come on the radio.  And all the hours I've spent going back and forth, I forget that most people don't have that type of interaction with their friends.  Like, I'm not afraid that I'm going to slip and be revealed as a racist ever.  No, never.  I'm honestly not.  Never.  Because I know what my interactions are and how I feel and how I'm honest about it.  I hate to say this, but I always felt like I was better off because I was white growing up, and I don't know exactly where that came from.  Well, you were. 
[01:41:00]  Well, are you living in a society that's white-dominated?  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, that's smart.  But a lot of people feel that way coming up.  And it wasn't preached to me by my parents by any means.  You just kind of had that feeling.  You know what I mean?  And I wonder if that's where a lot of this goes.  You feel the guilt of it, and you're like, okay.  It's the guilt of privilege.  I'm not going to get guilt of privilege is bullshit.  No, I'm wondering.  You know what?  It's all individual.  I see it as individual.  You know, like I said many times, growing up, and especially in my late teens and early 20s, I was in a shit circumstance as far as money and jobs and home. 
[01:41:30]  You know, I was living in my car.  So fuck this white privilege bullshit.  I'm not going to fucking eat anyone else's shit because I supposedly come from this privileged race.  Fuck you, man.  I lived in my car.  It's an individual by individual thing.  You're right.  But it's the way the country was structured.  It's like you can't deny that white people in America, at least up to this point, have enjoyed a much better ride here than fucking blacks. 
[01:42:00]  It's an impossibility to do that.  I would absolutely like to know why, and not based on, you know, institutional racism that was going on in the country years ago.  I mean, there just seems to be just a problem.  There's a fucking problem here that isn't being addressed.  Let me ask you, though.  You never felt just that because you were white, you just felt like you were better off, even though you had your hard times? 
[01:42:30]  Better off?  I had my hard times, but I always had this feeling like I know I'm better off in this society because I'm white.  But I had struggles, too, like yourself.  Did you ever have that feeling like I think I'm better off just because of the color of my skin?  Yeah, I guess so.  Sure.  I thought, you know.  And then you have your individual shit you got to deal with, obviously.  But, yeah, which I think it was more important, though, than feeling like I was better off being white. 
[01:43:00]  It didn't get me anything.  No, it wasn't.  Being white never got me anything that I didn't have to fucking, you know, work for anyway.  But the feeling I had, I can speak for myself, it was just kind of like, it was deep down.  I didn't, it wasn't on the surface, really.  I just always felt that.  Nope.  And it wasn't my parents.  It wasn't the schooling.  It was just an overall feeling I always had.  There are things, and I only got this from talking, like, there's too many guys I know that have had incidents of being stopped and questioned.  Like, it happens sometimes, and it's reasonable, and sometimes guys are dicks and they get pulled over. 
[01:43:30]  But it's happened too many times to guys I know where they were pulled over, like where they probably shouldn't have been.  Or not just where they were doing something wrong, but where they were like, literally, I was just, too many people I respect have told me the same kind of story about you just get these suspicious stares when you walk into a store.  And again, I know what the store owner's argument would be, because black people are stealing.  But then they would go, yeah, but I'm not stealing.  So I walk into a, like, look at how annoyed this story makes me and you.  And how annoying this is from this point of view. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  Imagine if it were reversed, and it was 19, whatever.  The fucking, the resentment and the fucking, so there has to be a way to look at it both ways.  I didn't grow up in white man's remorse.  It was just a general thing.  No, I'm not saying, I feel, I don't feel guilty.  No, someone's saying that.  Yeah, I don't feel guilty.  No, I'll never feel guilty.  I'm saying, as a society, what is, because it's happened, you can't deny it's happening.  It's happening all over, and it's never been talked about.  And that's why it's got to go deeper than just, we're afraid of getting in trouble. 
[01:44:30]  Because everybody didn't just one day go, oh no, we're going to get in trouble for reporting.  Like, the media wouldn't get in trouble for reporting racial epithets being.  Not in trouble, but they would get shit from black groups if they consistently, and that's what happened.  I remember a lot of black groups in the NAACP came forward and told the news agencies, hey, look, why are you always reporting black people?  Why does race have to come into it? 
[01:45:00]  And they stopped really reporting the race of the crimes unless it was white on black.  Then it's always reported as some kind of racist event.  But I don't think that that's just a surface, like, ah, we don't want to get yelled at.  I think it's way deeper than that.  We got Jay in Cleveland.  We're all going to Cleveland.  It's official.  Yes, we are.  Oh, good.  And I can't wait.  Jay, what's going on, buddy?  What's up, Jimmy?  I'll see you in Cleveland at the show.  Hello, buddy.  I'm a black guy.  I'm a black guy, and I see it like this. 
[01:45:30]  When a black on black crime happens, it's not as reported, or a black on white crime happens,  it's not as reported, because we go sit back and go see how these people act.  And wait, I want to jump in, too, and it's not reported because it's not as interesting as well.  Right.  It's not because it's like, oh.  For whatever reason.  It's just not.  It doesn't grab the attention, like, if it's a, you know, if it's a black on white.  Well, white on black, actually, is the number one.  Yeah, go ahead. 
[01:46:00]  Sorry.  Sorry, Jay.  Well, it looks like, well, see, look, they're just acting up all over again.  See, they can't give them anything, and they're just acting up all over again.  See, I don't, I talked to Anthony about this before.  I don't involve myself with all that type of stuff.  But when a white on black crime happens, you get to sit back and see, look, white people  act bad, too.  It's not only us.  And that's where the media steps in.  I'm not saying that it's right.  Right. 
[01:46:30]  And it's sickening.  And, like, in this case, with this teenager being shot, there's a second 911 tape out  from a neighbor calling 911 with this teenager yelling in the background for help.  It goes deeper than just this dude just pulling a gun out.  Right.  He's robbing it.  And, honey, can I ask you, let me just jump into it for a second, because there's something  interesting.  Like, when you look at the way the media reports things, and this is from the other side, and  there is truth in this, like, and again, I think Keith Robinson brought this out. 
[01:47:00]  It was a joke he was doing years ago.  But he goes, like, remember there was a black female soldier missing in Iraq?  All right.  And then, fucking man, when that white girl went missing, that fucking black chick, you  didn't hear nothing from her.  I still don't know what happened to that chick.  Awkward.  But there is that.  It was kind of awkward, wasn't it?  Yeah.  Or how many times do you hear missing kid cases that are black?  I mean, almost never.  It's always the beautiful blonde.  The beautiful blonde with the blue eyes.  So there is that shit, too. 
[01:47:30]  But that's not...  Look what we just did.  That means we don't think little black girls are beautiful.  But that's...  Well, yeah.  I'm serious.  But that's...  The media trains us that way.  Oh, it's a beautiful blonde girl.  But that's not spoken about.  Like, that's not talked about.  Of course not.  No one goes, hey, just showing the white kids.  It's just this thing that happens that comes from some other place.  Yeah.  Right.  I don't know where it's from.  I don't know where it's from.  I don't know why.  Like, I'm just middle-of-the-world black guy.  So I get looked from black people and white people because I walk around in cowboys using  a hat and drag race and off-road and talk about country music. 
[01:48:00]  But yet I know...  God, how bad do you want to be white?  Are you a gay hustler?  Jesus.  Oh, jeez.  This guy really wants to be white.  He sounds like fucking John Voight in Midnight Cowboy.  What the hell, dude?  What else?  Do you like guys blow you in bookstores?  I was listening to y'all and Jim Florentine the other day, pissed off.  I couldn't get through the phone.  Oh, we're not.  Because every time y'all talk about hip-hop, y'all misrepresent it.  Y'all are the white...  Oh, we're fucking around, dude.  I didn't misrepresent hip-hop.  I actually like hip-hop. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah, those were all just dumb jokes.  We're just fucking around.  The hip-hop.  All right, Jay.  Thank you.  We'll see you in Cleveland, all right?  Hey, I don't know how long it is, but Louis C.K. has a great bit on being white.  Oh, yes, he does.  Can you look that up real fast?  Maybe we go to break with that, and then we get Bob Kelly in here.  It's called I Enjoy Being White, I think.  Off Chewed Up, right?  I don't know.  I think.  I think that's where I heard it.  You got there real fast, D-Rock?  I should have gave you a secret message.  But I know the little side note on this whole thing is the fact that people were... 
[01:49:00]  were actually saying, are you afraid that you're going to get in trouble or fired for your tweets?  And I was saying nothing.  I wasn't being offensive.  I wasn't being...  But there is actually a fear when people read honest, opened racial discussions that someone's going to get fucked.  It's amazing.  You can't just discuss this anymore.  I was following your timeline last night, and I was amazed at that.  Because then I'm like, I saw one tweet where someone said, are you worried about being fired for what you're tweeting? 
[01:49:30]  So I quickly went to your page, and I'm like, what the fuck is he saying?  And then I'm reading all your tweets, and I'm like, he's not saying anything crazy here.  No, it's just open discussion on race.  And it was more than one person.  Yeah, yeah.  It was more than one person.  They're like, oh boy.  And somebody tweeted something interesting, too.  She's right.  Casey Anthony would not have gotten all that media attention if her and her daughter had been black.  Right.  She's right.  I agree.  But that subtle form of shit, that's the same fucking thing.  That mentality is the same thing as what's causing this to happen. 
[01:50:00]  Jimmy, you turned me on to something today.  I think it is a subtle thing.  I really, I think you hit home with this one today.  I'm kind of agreeing with you on this now.  You know, because they're not thinking of getting in trouble when they may be much more stressed  than the white people victims in those cases.  I was much older when I realized that all groups could be racist.  I was stupid.  But I think there's a lot of white people that thought they were the only ones that could be racist,  that only white people could be racist.  I've seen blatant racism that people, you know, in other ethnic groups.  You know who turned me on to? 
[01:50:30]  It was Anthony Kiedis, of all people.  We were interviewing him up in Worcester, I guess.  Worcester?  Because I think they were playing the Worcester Centrum.  Centrum.  Oh, no.  Whatever.  It doesn't matter where they were.  And we were interviewing him, and he said,  I believe all people have a little racism in them and a bit of hypocrisy.  Yeah.  And a light bulb went on it off in my head.  I'm like, holy fuck.  I never thought of it that way.  Yeah.  But I think he's absolutely right.  Even Reverend Al.  Oh, boy.  Especially Reverend Al.  Especially Reverend Al.  Especially Reverend Al. 
[01:51:00]  I say it like that because the average person would look at his bullshit and think,  oh, you know, he can't possibly be racist.  But, of course, especially.  Someone showed me a PSA with Reverend Al, and it was to be...  Blueberry pies?  No, it wasn't the blueberry pie one.  It was to be nice to gay people.  To not, you know...  Not call them faggots and homos like he's done?  Right, exactly.  Did he mention that?  No.  Oh!  Of course not.  But he's there like...  Is this a new promo? 
[01:51:30]  We must be tolerant.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, why?  Because those clips are getting out there finally.  Of course they are.  But it's him.  It's a bunch of people.  Like, it's a montage of people talking about being tolerant.  But you know what?  Let me say this.  Fuck the gay groups, too.  Because why are they not fucking...  Exactly.  Where are you guys all over Sharpton?  Yes.  Where are you fucking phonies?  Where's GLAAD and all these groups all over Sharpton for having the position he has now  and having said all those horrible things?  He's the worst.  Why fight somebody that will probably fight back, that has other people that will defend him, 
[01:52:00]  when you could just go after people that buckle right under?  Reverend Al understands that white guilt.  Oh, boy.  He gets that white guilt.  He uses that to his advantage.  The blueberry pie guilt, I call it.  Sure.  Yeah.  Louis C.K., this is a great little bit as we go to break, and Bob Kelly will join us  next, who is going to be at Governor's this weekend, I think.  Is she allowed?  I think so.  I think that's what he's promoting today.  And we'll talk about the jizz trees with Bobby, because I was walking around New York.  They're blooming.  They're blooming, and all I think of is Bob Kelly and the jizz trees.  The jizz trees, dude. 
[01:52:30]  Boom, you got your cum smell.  You got your flowers.  Remember I cupped him and held him under his nose how sick he got?  I got the video.  I'll repost it today on my Twitter.  It's worth watching.  But first, Louis C.K., being white.  Sorry I'm being so negative.  I'm a bummer.  I don't know.  I shouldn't be.  I'm a very lucky guy.  I got a lot going for me.  I'm healthy.  I'm relatively young.  I'm white, which thank God for that shit, boy.  That is a huge leg up.  Are you kidding me? 
[01:53:00]  Oh, God, I love being white.  I really do.  Seriously, if you're not white, you're missing out, because this shit is thoroughly good.  But let me be clear, by the way.  I'm not saying that white people are better.  I'm saying that being white is clearly better.  Who could even argue?  If it was an option, I would re-up every year.  Oh, yeah, I'll take white again.  Absolutely.  Other than enjoying that, I'm going to stick with white.  Thank you. 
[01:53:30]  Here's how great it is to be white.  I could get in a time machine and go to any time, and it would be fucking awesome when  I get there.  That is exclusively a white privilege.  Black people can't fuck with time machines.  A black guy in a time machine is like, hey, I think before 1980, no thank you, I don't  want to go.  But I can go to any time.  The year two?  I don't even know what was happening then. 
[01:54:00]  But I know when I get there, welcome, we have a table right here for you, sir.  Thank you.  It's lovely here in the air, too.  I can go to any time.  In the past, I don't want to go to the future and find out what happens to white people,  because we're going to pay hard for this shit.  You got to know that.  We're not going to just fall from number one to two.  They're going to hold us down and fuck us in the ass forever.  And we totally deserve it.  But for now, whee! 
[01:54:30]  Now, if you're white and you don't admit that it's great, you're an asshole.  It is great.  And I'm a man.  How many advantages could one person have?  I'm a white man.  You can't even hurt my feelings.  What can you really call a white man that really digs the...  Hey, cracker.  Oh, ruined my day. 
[01:55:00]  Boy, shouldn't have called me a cracker.  Bringing me back to owning land and people.  What a drag.  You know how you can tell how pretty a white woman is?  The value.  You look at her and then you wonder how long they would look for if she was missing. 
[01:55:30]  Come on, take a look.  Take a look.  Look at this nigga looking.  Look, look, look, look, look!  I saw you look mad, sweetie.  How long if you was missing?  How long you think they were...  How long you think they were...  Exactly.  She don't even...  She went...  You know the deal. 
[01:56:00]  I ain't saying nothing wrong.  White woman's life is valuable.  What's his name?  Joran Vandersloot?  Right?  We find out he was a serial killer.  Man, he kills women.  That's what he do.  He do it well.  You know what I mean?  We know the girl that he...  You know, supposedly had...  What's the girl in Aruba?  Natalie Holloway.  Right?  But the one...  He just killed a girl in Peru.  What's her name? 
[01:56:30]  Exactly.  Look how fast you said Natalie.  You said Natalie.  Natalie Holloway.  That angel.  Y'all said that like Family Feud.  All right.  Name a white girl I've been missing for five years in Aruba.  Natalie Holloway.  Survey says... 
[01:57:00]  Name a Peruvian girl that was killed yesterday.  The brilliance of Patrice O'Neal.  Yes.  I miss him so much.  That's not the bit I was thinking of, but that's a brilliant example.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  Yeah.  Kind of what we were discussing before the break, right?  Yes.  I miss that guy.  Bob Kelly in studio playing the brokerage out on Long Island all weekend long, Friday  and Saturday night.  I think I'm going Saturday.  Get out of here. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, we are.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is the first time you've ever seen me.  Danny, Keith the Cop.  Right?  No, I saw you during the fucking virus tour shit.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, but this is the first show, my show you've ever been to.  Oh, my show.  The first hour show.  I'm sorry.  I was talking about you, Bob.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm pretty sure.  Bobby's amazing.  You haven't seen a full Bob Kelly set yet, Ant?  Is that what you're saying?  No, no.  I haven't.  Cut to Anthony going, ah, shut up.  This is bullshit.  Fucking just walking out. 
[01:58:00]  No, Bobby is great, man.  Brokers this weekend.  Good for you.  Yeah, it's going to be fun.  I got to bring something up real quick.  Like, I have to re-up for my pistol permit, right?  Uh-huh.  It's every two years.  I think it's three years now, but it's two years since I got it.  And believe me, it's so much fun.  There's the New York State one, and then there's the New York City one.  They're completely separate.  A New York State one is not valid in New York City. 
[01:58:30]  You need a New York State one, and then you can get a New York City one.  That's how fucked this is.  Let me, let me, I just got my letter here of what I need, not to get a new one, to re-up  in the city, to exercise my Second Amendment fucking right, and this is what I need.  Don't they have all this stuff you're about to...  Exactly.  They should have all this already.  No, no, they...  From when you originally went for your license.  They might.  Nothing's changed.  Okay.  But here's some of the stuff I need. 
[01:59:00]  And this isn't even a complete list.  Renewal application, which is 10 pages long.  Must be typed.  Typed?  Yes.  Who types?  Exactly.  Actually, like, you have to find a typewriter?  Yeah.  There's only four left, you know.  I know.  There's only four typewriters left.  Can't you type it on a computer?  You might be able to.  Yeah.  They could.  Yeah.  Something like that.  How about letter of necessity?  What does that mean?  That means, hey, you can't just exercise your Second Amendment right. 
[01:59:30]  You need a reason to be able to do that.  But you have to write that?  Yeah.  Or you have to get it from somebody else?  That's what I'm going to write it for you.  A security assessment has to be made.  See, this is why I go illegal, man.  It's so much easier.  Isn't it?  Oh, Jesus.  Holy fuck.  You just go illegal, Bobby.  Sure.  My friend has the most fuckable bottom in town.  And by the way, you go illegal in New York City, absolute guarantee two years in prison.  But it's better.  That's it.  It's easier that way, man.  Oh, it's so much easier to get fucking the ass in prison.  You go uptown.  They open up the hood of a car.  Yeah. 
[02:00:00]  Choke up a car.  Even better.  Letter of necessity.  Two passport-type color photographs of yourself.  Money order or credit authorization for renewal fee in the amount of $340.  Carbon duplicate of your license included in the renewal package.  Signed affirmation of familiarity with rules and law.  Well, safeguarding acknowledgement must be witnessed by third party.  That means, hey, who's going to take your guns if something happens? 
[02:00:30]  Yeah, I'll take it.  Cohabitant affidavit.  Signed by all persons residing with you.  And their signature must be notarized.  Copy of the first page of U.S. passport in color.  Copy of your Social Security card in color.  Copy of your current driver's license in color.  Copy of your current business carry license front and back in color.  Copy of other license permits certificates you possess that are required of you or your business for New York State color. 
[02:01:00]  Copy of your residential phone bill showing your name and address.  Copy of New York State business telephone bill showing name of business and address.  Copy of first page of New York State workers' comp policy showing current and active coverage.  Copy of first page of any New York State insurance policies that are required for you to run a business in New York State. 
[02:01:30]  Letter from your business bank reflecting knowledge of an active business account with your business name, address, account number.  Oh, yeah.  Are you almost done?  Copy of last three months' business bank statements.  Copy of completed federal tax return for 2011.  Why the fuck do they need your fucking business bank statements?  Because they don't want you to have a fucking pistol license.  So they make it as hard as possible.  They do this so you go, fuck it, and give up. 
[02:02:00]  It's my Second Amendment right, and I have to do all this?  So fuck anybody that goes, well, there should be some system in place that keeps people from, you know, anyone from buying a gun.  Fuck you!  Are you almost done?  This is a pain in the ass.  I'm hoping not, by the way.  Oh, that was it?  Okay.  That doesn't seem like a lot.  That, by the way, is just for my New York City, my state, which is renewing.  I also have to go through hoops for that one before I could even submit for this one.  Is it every two years? 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, three years now.  But it's like, why the fuck does an American have to go through that shit?  Believe me, there's quicker ways to find out if I'm okay.  If I've been okay for two years.  Sure.  Read your Twitter.  Exactly.  Read my Twitter.  Exactly.  That's a good way to get around it.  Thank God they're not asking for that.  Fucking paperwork.  We want your Twitter feed, huh, buddy?  Oh, shit.  Red flag.  I wasn't exaggerating.  I didn't put in anything there that wasn't in that you're required to have. 
[02:03:00]  It's ludicrous.  It's anti, it's against the Constitution, and it just shouldn't be.  It should not fucking be.  But Texas, you can, I mean, you can walk into the Walmart and come out with a shotgun.  You have to show up with a hat.  You can.  Yeah, yeah.  Stop.  You can.  You can.  You can stop.  But New York City, they try to, and especially people like Bloomberg, try to make it sound  like they do these things, they put these things in place to keep guns out of the hands 
[02:03:30]  of, you know, crazy people.  It's overkill.  They're saying you have to submit more documentation for a pistol permit than for a mortgage.  Yes.  A mortgage is pretty rough, too, though, man.  I think if nobody ever threw a house at somebody in anger.  Well, how about a car, a driver's license?  It's so much easier to get a driver's license, and people get killed on the roads, thousands  of people a year.  And that isn't a right.  It's a privilege.  Yeah, but cars are weapons, man.  Yeah, nobody ever hid their car in their pocket and robbed somebody with it. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, God.  And then Jimmy does this fucking laugh.  He's opening his back.  He's doing like a Norman Fell thing.  You know, and in a weird way, it makes me feel good.  It's not going to deter you, obviously.  Why does it make you feel good?  Because the people, the people, the bad people, aren't going to do that.  They're just buying illegal guns and shooting people.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  I forgot about that part.  The people that want to defend against that have to go through so many hoops that they  say, fuck it, and you're left as fucking victims out there. 
[02:04:30]  It makes me feel good that it's not as easy as people think it is to get a pistol.  That's what I mean, I guess.  You know what?  Do whatever fucking background check you want to do on me.  Well, the media makes it sound like it's all willy-nilly.  It's pretty damn easy just to get a fucking pistol.  By the way, I don't own a Social Security card.  I haven't since I was a kid.  I know my number.  I know the Social Security number.  What is it, illegal?  I'm kidding.  It's five?  No.  I know the number, but I haven't had the actual card since I lived in California.  How many digits? 
[02:05:00]  Now I need to get a fucking card.  How many digits?  We want to try to figure out how old you really are.  Oh, it's only five.  It's only five?  Yeah, I have a Social Security card with only five digits.  His Social Security number is two.  I get it.  There he goes.  He's doing it again.  Will you stop?  It's great for radio.  He keeps touching me, though.  He keeps grabbing me.  He leans over and hits you and puts his big Norman Fels smile on.  It's like hanging out with a baby orangutan.  Stop touching me.  I'm just monkeying around.  Oh, God.  Oh, boy.  What is this?  Stop it.  And your list gave me anxiety, and I don't get anxiety.  It's crazy.  Because I hate filling out forms to begin with. 
[02:05:30]  And they know that.  If you get married, all the forms go away.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You just fucking here.  Fill this shit up.  Fill this out.  Taking a nap.  You can't with this.  You have to do it all yourself.  You don't have to do all that yourself.  You can have somebody do it.  No, actually, I have somebody that prepares these things, but I have to get all the stuff.  And by the way, the preparer gets a few thousand dollars.  A few thousand dollars.  Why can't you prepare?  I can do that.  I'll do it for you in 20 minutes.  Bing, boom, bang.  You know what?  It's political.  It's a political thing.  Wait, it's a small business?  It's almost like having a...  It's a small business for some guy? 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  You hire these guys to get all the info?  It's almost like going to court with an attorney or without one.  Like, the attorney talks to the DDA and, like, figures shit out.  That's what you need.  So, can I ask you a question?  If something's messed up, are you fucked?  Like, if he messes up one thing, is it all fucked and you have to do it all over again?  Yes.  I'm sure.  And if it's fucked and then you go over the expiration date for the license, you don't go for a renewal.  Now you have to go all the way and do it again and have the six-month wait and everything else to get the license. 
[02:06:30]  It all of a sudden becomes a brand new thing.  Why don't you just get a cheapie just to commute down there from Texas?  Oh, boy.  Oh, God.  He's doing it again.  I can't stand it.  Bobby keeps moving over because Jimmy's just leaning and hitting him.  Why don't you just get a knife?  Just get a nice hot knife.  You know what?  You can't even carry that in New York.  Yeah, you can.  No.  You're not going to get two years in jail for a knife.  Well, you know.  That's right.  Just say that you're a banana cutter.  Just tell me your name is Mac. 
[02:07:00]  Mac the knife.  Oh, boy.  There he goes again.  I don't like it.  Bobby's horrified by this.  I don't like it.  This Jimmy bit.  I don't fucking like it.  I'm just leaning silently, hitting him with my hand like I'm on to laugh.  You're way over there now, Bobby.  Yeah, because Danny doesn't touch me.  He's been touching you, too.  Look, I understand there's a lot of people saying it's easy to get a permit in Alabama.  I know.  You don't have to call with that.  I know how easy it is in other places to get this.  Tell us to live there.  Yeah.  I'm saying New York City is, they try to make it sound like it's, like you shouldn't have 
[02:07:30]  a gun, and people that can get a gun should go through more, there should be more stricter  controls.  Absolutely.  It's, oh, please.  What could be more fucking strict?  Piss test DNA fucking jizz.  That's right.  Jizz.  I don't know.  It's just, to me, it's overkill on doing a background check.  They just do it to weed out people that don't have the energy to fucking do it. 
[02:08:00]  It's your right, motherfucker.  You don't think it's right for Manhattan to be a little, I mean, to be that aggressive?  Why?  Because then, I mean, if it was easier to get a gun in Manhattan, a lot more people would  have guns in the city of Manhattan.  Is that a problem?  Well, when the Constitution was written, there wasn't this amount of people.  Oh, it doesn't matter.  Yeah, it has to be interpreted.  No, it doesn't.  Like, because you're a responsible guy.  You're the guy I want owning a gun.  Yeah, they have muskets.  Thank you, sir.  Because you're willing to do all this stuff.  We're not talking about you.  And your shit's in order, and you're qualified, and you're tested.  So even though it's really annoying, that system guarantees that a guy like you can get 
[02:08:30]  one, and a guy like you should have one, because there's a reason for it.  Let's settle down about a guy like him.  Have you been to one of his parties when he's rolling around in boxes?  Well, by that, I mean homosexual.  Fucking wet with a gun and a hot tub.  Party!  Yeah, he's like fucking Scarface.  Everybody's ducking every time he turns.  He's making a foot on blackface, and he's chasing us around the yard.  Yeah, I'm all saying.  What are we doing here?  What are we doing?  We've all seen that, Anthony.  Let's not put Anthony up on a pedestal yet, okay?  Come on.  He's okay.  I'm very safe. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, put him under the pedestal so his head gets all crushed.  Right, Bobbo?  Oh, my God.  Bobbo.  Right, Bobbo?  And now he's doing the arm thing.  Poor Bobby.  I just hate it.  There's a new one, too.  Yeah.  I hate the new one.  Yeah, the new one sucks.  Where he just opens his mouth.  Oh, yeah.  Chippy Dickerson.  Oh, God.  It's a country chip.  Y'all.  Oh.  Yeah.  What's y'all doing with your cowboy hats, y'all?  I don't like that at all.  I don't like that one at all.  This is terrible. 
[02:09:30]  I'm going to eat me some true grits or something like John Wayne movies, y'all.  Oh, that's horrible.  That is awful.  I hate it.  I hate everything.  Yikes.  So, yeah, I just, I think, when people bring up that thing you brought up, too, well, it  was muskets back then, and now there's weapons that, here's my point on that.  The First Amendment, what, should we only have little scrolls to read and fucking face-to-face  conversations?  Well, the First Amendment never considered Twitter.  Oh, well, so, because there's modern technology now involved in freedom of speech, we should 
[02:10:00]  throw away the First Amendment?  Fuck that.  Yeah, they advanced as far as firearms go.  Good.  We should still be allowed to have, and again, should we have flamethrowers and grenades?  No, we're not allowed to.  So, fine.  I'm fine with that.  And more importantly yet, we got a guy, we got two guys.  Here's a guy.  Here's a guy.  It's easier to get a hazmat license to haul 8,000, it looks like, or 80.  80,000 pounds of deadly chemicals. 
[02:10:30]  One page.  One page.  One page.  And then, you got to hear what this guy had to do to renew his permit.  Re-upped his permit.  Oh, PA?  Yeah, Pennsylvania.  Let's do this.  Go ahead, Steve.  Yes.  Morning, boys.  Yeah, and I just re-upped my PA full carry, and it cost me $12 and a full copy of my driver's  license.  Yeah, I have...  Is that really it for Pennsylvania?  I have a full carry Pennsylvania license.  And that's all it takes?  I'm allowed.  A non-resident is allowed to get a Pennsylvania full carry license.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  What are you doing in Pennsylvania? 
[02:11:00]  It's legit in, like, 20 other states also.  What are you doing there?  It's reciprocal.  Oh, that's why?  Yeah.  So I was like, all right, I'll get that, and that way I could carry in various other states  if need be.  Yeah.  That's all this guy needed, though.  You fly with your gun?  No, you're not allowed to fly.  You can pack it in your luggage separate from ammo.  No, you have to meet with the TSA and let them know that you have a gun packed in your  checked luggage.  You know, obviously not carry-on.  Right.  And then you can fly it to a state that reciprocates, that identifies your license and accepts your 
[02:11:30]  out-of-state license for them.  New York is accepted by a few states.  New York accepts no other state's license.  So if you have a license in any of the 50 fucking states in the Union, you're not allowed  to come into New York with your license and your fucking gun.  There's a story about some woman who, she's in med school.  Oh, yeah, we've talked about it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She went to go check her gun downtown.  Yeah, she was trying to do the right thing, too, and they fucked her anyway. 
[02:12:00]  Nothing's going to happen to her, no jail.  No, no.  With a Marine.  He's fine, too.  But they had to, you know, get arrested.  They were fucking arrested.  But here's the thing.  Was she actually doing the right thing?  Because she should have, before her trip, should have checked the New York laws.  She should have never brought it into New York, you're right.  So, you know, while I do think that it's a ridiculous situation, she should have really  been the responsible party to go and actually go and see if it was legal for her to bring  it into the state in the first place.  We need a national fucking permit.  A national permit where you're able to do it. 
[02:12:30]  They do a background check on you, and you get your fucking gun, and you get your license,  and you're able to go to any fucking state in the Union.  I got one because I'm a marshal.  No, you're not.  Chip, you're not.  If you, if you, but if you had, if I had a gun, I'd fucking use it.  I'd get that angry.  But if I, I would, I would, I would, ugh.  Would you really?  I'd probably fire it in the air.  Would you be?  Like a fucking Iraqi.  Why?  Why?  At the end of a good set at the brokerage this weekend?  Come on!  Bang, bang, bang, bang!  Boom, boom, yeehaw!  How great, you know you'd love to do that. 
[02:13:00]  It's great responsibility.  Yes.  You go to the range.  You go to the range, and you fucking...  Have you ever been in the car with Norton in traffic?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  If he had a gun.  I'm terrible in traffic.  If you knew he had a gun, I'd get out.  I'd fucking, I'm scared.  If I had a gun, I'd put you out.  I'm scared with Norton, his anger, and he can't, if he hit you, it wouldn't even hurt.  My gun would just go off by accident.  Oh, you think so?  I would be...  Just fumble it like Fredo in the street. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, something stupid would happen.  I don't think I would...  Your phone would ring, and you'd answer your gun.  I'm an angry guy, but I don't think I would shoot it, like you're saying, but I know absolutely  that it would go off in some dumb manner.  Yeah.  I would point it at somebody.  I would love to, if somebody fucking in traffic is looking over at me, I would love to just  raise it and just show it to them.  Oh, no.  I'd go to jail and me.  No, see, you can't do that.  It's brandishing.  That's why...  Not allowed to brandish.  You can't...  That'd be a good name for a band.  Brandish.  It's already a band.  Brandish. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, but see, that's exactly what I'm talking about.  Yeah, you can't do that.  Most...  You, your temperament, you can have...  You don't even know you have a gun.  You never took it out.  You never...  He's a horrible temperament.  I'm a horrible person, but...  Of course you are.  My temperament is okay.  Like a drunk coyote.  Fucking...  Fucking...  Oh, shit.  It's all right.  That list is exhausting.  Good luck with that, Anne.  It's crazy.  Good luck with that.  And that's what I'll be dealing with until the expiration date.  Have you been smelling the jizz trees, Bobby? 
[02:14:30]  Because everybody wants to know.  Oh, Bobby.  I was walking around yesterday, and they're in full bloom.  I only think...  Now I think about...  Whenever I smell cum, I think about...  Yes, that's how I feel when I taste it.  As you should, little boy.  It's...  Yeah, they're...  Who is that?  It's going to explode it in his hand.  Oh.  Yeah, they're out.  They're not smelling yet, though.  You can't...  They smell a little bit.  When do they start smelling?  You know what it smells like?  Just pure jizz.  Yeah, yeah.  Cauliflower.  Oh, really? 
[02:15:00]  Cauliflower.  I can't...  Cauliflower.  I can't have...  Cauliflower.  Cauliflower.  I can't have it in the house.  Yeah.  It cooked cauliflower is fine.  Raw cauliflower.  I can't eat it.  I can't fucking have it around.  I smell just like jizz.  Like cum.  It does?  Cauliflower?  Way too much cum, though.  It's just too much.  I look...  There's certain...  There's cum...  You can...  You know, after you...  He was about to say you could fucking eat.  You could eat.  Yeah, you could take it in your hand.  Eat. 
[02:15:30]  I fucking eat that shit.  Right.  Like that.  You know the girl's face when you're done?  Like you...  Okay, I can deal with that.  But just...  But not one of those like gangbang ones where they're all jerking.  And it's covering her face.  She looks like the top of a Cinnabon.  Those are tasty, too.  They are delicious.  Also.  Yeah.  You get it?  Help, Anthony.  I hate this.  This new little Jimmy. 
[02:16:00]  That's way too much.  Yeah, that's...  That's it.  Oh, God.  Oh, the bits got all over town.  There's nothing sexy about that to me.  No.  Start licking it off.  Oh, God.  You wouldn't lick it off?  You've never eaten your own cum off a chick's face.  I ate that on my hand once.  No, you didn't.  Sure I did.  No, you didn't.  Put a picture up on Twitter.  I have a picture of myself licking my own cum out of my hand.  You can't see my dick just to come.  The girl told me to on a webcam.  Clean it, bitch.  Oh, God.  So I should have been talking to her. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, that facial is going all over her.  I know.  Aren't cum shot scenes in porno like such a surprise?  Because the guy's like, oh, I'm going to cum.  I'm going to cum.  And you're like, you don't know if it's going to be a big one or a dribbler.  And it's like, oh, wow.  Yeah, she took a face full.  Or it's, oh, God.  This guy fucking mean guy shit.  I hate a dribbler.  You get disappointed if the guy doesn't have enough cum.  It's just the clear stuff.  It's not even the white heavy stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like a glub, glub, glub, glub.  You don't like it when it just drools out?  It's got a fire, like, upper face.  Like the guy's leaving the mark of Zorro on her face. 
[02:17:00]  I'm showing Bob my handle a cum.  Why would you eat that?  Why would you eat your own self?  Because the girl told me to.  Well, what the fuck?  Then you got to.  Say no?  Yeah, well, fine.  You go ahead and be disrespectful.  Don't do what you're told.  Waste a tasty treat.  Exactly.  You go ahead.  You don't do what you're told.  I love Sweet Park Company.  I'd love to see behind her webcam.  It's like eight fucking girlfriends just watching this shh dribble.  He's going to do what he's going to do.  Shh, shh.  Eat it. 
[02:17:30]  Eat it.  Go ahead.  Oh, I wouldn't care who she told.  I told people I did it.  Yeah, that's true.  He told people how fucking.  That's the best part about Norton.  He didn't.  I was a bitch and I ate it like I was instructed to do so.  I ate my own.  I was a cum-eating boy.  I was a cum-eating boy.  He didn't make you throw up?  He didn't make you want to puke?  I didn't like it because I already blew my load.  Like, if I could eat my own cum, like, before I blew a load, it would turn me on.  Like, if I could shit something out into my hand and eat it.  What a paradox that is.  You've got to save it.  You save it in the fridge and then microwave it. 
[02:18:00]  Ooh, cold cum treats.  Yeah, and then eat it.  Or having a cold cum treats.  It's so funny, though.  Before you cum and after you cum, the mentality is, oh, I would do anything before I cum.  Dude, I want to lick my grandma's pussy so bad and I can't do it because that means I already came.  And then she's like, go fucking towel out, you pig.  Yuck, boo.  Oh, shit.  It's so funny.  Instantly, when you cum, her voice changes. 
[02:18:30]  Just, oh, God.  Yeah, you want to get some food?  You want to get some food?  Oh, God.  Yeah, that really is just the quickest U-turn.  Come on my face, baby.  Oh, baby, I love your car.  Oh, fucking shut your face.  It's like, I had my face down there.  Why?  Why did I have my face down there?  Visually, they've changed, too.  And beforehand, it's like, oh, I want to fucking lick that box. 
[02:19:00]  I want to fucking eat.  And then you cum, and it's like, ew.  I had my face there.  Buzz off, you.  Oh, jeez.  Buzz off.  Her razor bumps down there.  Did she use an old razor to shave her box?  Yeah.  Is that an ingrown hair?  Yeah.  It's got to be one and done every time, right?  And then it starts.  But then it starts coming back after a little while.  You're kind of like, I think I want my face down there again.  Yeah, I think I want to.  It slowly comes back.  You're like, eh.  Not the same day it doesn't.  What? 
[02:19:30]  No.  You're a crazy person.  It happens.  I agree with him.  The pen used to be like 20, 30 minutes.  You'd be like, oh.  New hot chick?  No.  No, the same girl?  All night.  Really?  Yeah, you've got to keep going.  You're only a one-a-day guy now?  Me?  I'm nothing.  Nothing.  I'm nothing.  You know where I have my fun?  In the shower drain.  That's it.  Fucking.  I'm on my tippy-toes.  Oh, God. 
[02:20:00]  I'm on like a broad peeing at a dirty mobile station.  I'm just on my tippy-toes, squatting down, trying to get it in the drain because I don't  want to clean it up because I'm too fat to bend down and pick up my jizz in the shower.  You can jerk off in the shower, dude.  My shower?  Does it get on your leg and leave those little blue lumps on your leg hair?  I've never done it.  Oh, yeah.  You've never jerked off in the shower?  Why is water all over me?  No.  What am I, a fucking fish?  No.  I jerk off in bed.  You can jerk off in the shower.  Not me.  Jerking off in the shower is all right.  Yeah.  I'm fucking all the water's cascading. 
[02:20:30]  Insta-clean.  It's fucking...  My shower's big enough.  I put my...  I have the shower heads.  It's not a size issue.  I don't spin it in a circle when I jerk off.  And I get the...  You use your products for lube.  Yeah, but...  I get the shower massage underneath my balls.  And then your pee hole hurts because you used the shampoo.  You're fucking 14?  I like...  What are you, a girl?  Props?  You got fucking, like, jerk off props like that when you were a kid.  I put my leg up on the bench.  Oh, jeez.  And then I get the shower.  The thinker jerking off.  You put your fist under your chin.  He's trying to think of something stupid that rhymes in thinker. 
[02:21:00]  Stinker.  It's easy.  Come drinker.  You got some kind of Tebow pose as you're jerking off in the shower.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Underneath from the back.  You know what I really like is when the massage girls give you the...  table showers and they used to...  You're talking like everyone does this.  I'm sorry.  You've never done it?  I don't like that.  I feel like a fucking car.  She hangs a little tree on me when she pushes me through to the next fucking...  Well, she should.  ...chip hang off a slave ship deck.  What did you say?  Well, she should. 
[02:21:30]  Well, she should hang that fucking thing on there.  Yeah.  Little pine tree.  Off my helmet.  I smell like a girl ass!  Oh, sorry.  Bobby, continue because we've got Florentine.  He wants to talk about the Tebow thing.  Oh.  The jerking off thing.  Oh.  Were you done?  You weren't done.  I'm done.  No, I just like jerking off in the shower.  But then you clean it up.  The shower water should eventually fucking break it down.  Break it down.  No, because if you have the tub, it goes down to the drain.  But once that hot water hits it, it turns into fucking egg white.  And then it attaches.  Egg white cement.  I have slate on my thing. 
[02:22:00]  On my floor.  It's not like...  It's slate flooring.  Of course.  It doesn't go smoothly down the drain.  Oh, it catches in the nooks and crannies.  Yeah, it catches in the fucking grout.  Oh, God.  It's like coming in stucco.  Looks like a dirty aquarium.  You're in there with fucking paper towel.  You got fin rot or ick in the drain.  I have ick in the drain.  The greatest disease ever.  No, your fish has ick.  Looks like jizz on his fins.  That made us sad growing up when the ick would hit our tank. 
[02:22:30]  Sorry, your Jack Dempsey has ick.  What?  My angelfish has ick.  My kissing garami.  Damn, you got good fish.  We had guppies.  Would you have neons?  Fucking guppies, neons, and black mollies.  Remember the black mollies?  I had Jack Dempsey's and angelfish and garamis.  And we had some of the catfish that stick on the side.  Look like fucking ugly vaginas sticking on the side of your tank.  I'm going to get a tank. 
[02:23:00]  Fish are the worst.  I'm getting back into the fish business.  They are terrible.  They have no will to live.  They just fucking hate life.  That is true.  One little piece of dust gets into your tank and everything dies.  I'm out.  Fuck.  I'm out.  The wrong food, I'm out.  Let me get Florentine on the line.  Bobby, I know you're a big football fan as well.  Yeah.  Everyone's talking about the Tebow thing.  And as soon as this Tebow thing happened, everyone was thinking about Florentine and  some of the shit he said on our show a mere couple days ago.  He was right. 
[02:23:30]  Florentine.  What's going on?  Hey, man.  Hey, Jim.  Well, now tell me my theory isn't right about guys not wanting to sign a hometown.  And said it.  Yep.  And said it.  That's exactly what Florentine said.  Because Tebow is a guy, they say, like, he just hangs around his family and his close  friends.  He doesn't go out.  He just hangs out at home.  He even orders food in.  He won't even go to a restaurant.  Ugh.  In Florida.  So now all of a sudden he's going to come to New York.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He didn't want to be around his fucking family and friends.  He's done. 
[02:24:00]  Even a guy, even a fucking Christian that just wants to hang out with his family and friends  doesn't want to play in his hometown.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you think that's going to fuck with, uh, what's his name?  Sanchez.  Sanchez.  Oh, totally.  I mean, that's, as a Miami fan, you're a Patriot fan, Bobby?  Yeah, I was.  Oh, I was.  You got a Patriots fan here, you got a Cowboys fan here, and of course a Jets fan, so.  Well, yeah, because you got a lot of Jets fan.  I'm a Justin Evolte fan.  I'm a Jets fan.  If you're not a Jets fan, this is the greatest thing ever, because it's a complete circus now. 
[02:24:30]  Florentine, I tweeted as soon as this happened, I'm like, look, I loved watching Tebow Mania.  I loved it.  But I didn't want it on my team.  No, you don't want that, because this is what's going to happen.  Week one, when Sanchez throws two interceptions, the next week, every fucking Jets fan, because  they're all pricks in a good way, are going to show up with Tebow jerseys on a MetLife  stadium.  I disagree with you, because.  You're going to taunt Sanchez.  I disagree with you.  We were talking about this earlier.  New York fans are such assholes that they're going to be cheering Tebow opening day. 
[02:25:00]  Opening day.  They're going to be Tebow.  Opening fucking day.  Tebow.  Because they're assholes.  Yeah.  I mean, it's true.  I mean, like 70% of Jets fans are done with Sanchez.  They don't want him on the team anymore.  He's not going to bring us to the next level.  So, yeah, it could start week one.  But that first interception, forget it.  Then it gets ugly.  You're right.  Yeah, he fucks up.  Like the first, yeah, the first fuck up he has.  The first time he fucking fades back and has to get rid of the ball and just dumps it.  They're going to be chanting Tebow. 
[02:25:30]  So, Florenton, you know way more about football than us, certainly.  How is this going to work out on paper?  What are they going to do?  First of all, I love how the Jets owner, Woody Johnson, came out a week ago and goes,  Oh, no, we passed on Peyton Manning.  Really?  But then you take Tim Tebow.  Really?  You passed on him, but you wanted Tebow instead.  Right.  Fucking liars.  And then they signed that Drew Stanton guy, the Jets, as a backup from the Lions.  And they promised him that he was going to be the second string quarterback and they're not going to sign anybody else. 
[02:26:00]  Now that fucking guy's crying.  They're all bullshitters.  But, no, it's going to be a disaster for the Jets.  And the Jets, at the end of the year, go, Look, we're going to be a team next year.  There's going to be no drama going on.  And then you fucking sign Tebow to stand on the sidelines.  Oh, nothing but drama right there, yeah.  And Tebow coming to New York, forget it.  The guy's going to be out of control.  And you've got to think he's going to be taking some snaps right away.  He's not going to be a traditional backup quarterback.  It seems like Rex Ryan will put him in there for the Wildcat and some other things. 
[02:26:30]  That's the thing.  If he would have went to New England or, say, Green Bay, where they got franchise quarterbacks,  he wouldn't be taking any snaps.  No one would even say, if Aaron Rodgers threw an interception, put Tebow in.  Right, right.  That's not even close.  But with Sanchez there, forget it.  He's going to be taking snaps.  He's going to be coming in on third downs.  And Sanchez is going to be on the sideline fucking crying.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's going to be crying like a baby because there's going to be practice and all these  plays in practice.  And then when the game comes, that's what happened in Miami with Chad Henney.  He would just go on the sideline half the game and fucking have Ronnie Brown or Ricky Williams 
[02:27:00]  running that shit.  Right.  You think Tebow could handle the pressure of playing in New York?  Yeah.  That doesn't bother him.  Really?  What about the New York press?  Like, that's the shit.  They're going to fucking, like, open up on him.  Oh, without a doubt.  Because he'll go out to dinner in New York.  I'm predicting by, like, August he's going to be pulling trains with A-Rod.  Temptation.  Too much temptation.  You're like, ah, yeah, you know, it's all fucking rednecks there.  You know, there's nothing going on.  But when you go to New York and you've got hot models all over you, forget it. 
[02:27:30]  All those fucking bookstores on 6th Avenue, how is he going to resist just going in and  fucking tooting on one in the hole?  Tooting on one?  Tooting on one?  Yeah, I think he's going to have problems.  It's amazing because, you know, in that trade, the Jaguars, Denver actually did the right  thing and said, all right, if you want to go to Jets or Jaguars, you pick the team.  The Jaguars actually offered more money to give back to Denver and a better draft pick,  and he still took the Jets. 
[02:28:00]  Right.  So at least they did the right thing.  But it's funny how Peyton Manning and his press conference the day before, oh, I can't  wait to have Tim Tebow as a teammate.  I met him once, and he seemed like a good guy.  He's the reason he was fucking out of there in 24 hours.  Yeah, of course.  And that was Peyton's doing.  He told the boys over there, get rid of Tebow.  I don't want to deal with that shit.  Without a doubt.  He told them right from the beginning.  Meanwhile, you know, if it wasn't with Tebow last year with his fucking antics and getting  to Denver in the playoffs, Manning would have never went to Denver.  They would have been 4-12.  Right. 
[02:28:30]  And he would have, I'm not going to that shitty team.  Right.  Now it's like a better team.  I can't wait to play with Tim.  Yeah, please.  There's never been a good backup behind Manning.  He's a fucking egomaniac that wants every snap in practice.  There's no way he's going to have Tebow on the sidelines.  I can't wait for fucking Denver to just completely fail this year and not even make the playoffs.  That'll be a good, yeah.  Yeah, I'd like to see that, too.  Hey, the other football story, Sean Payton and the Saints thing there.  A lot of people are saying that was a much bigger story yesterday.  Well, you know, the commissioner just has to try to save his face because, you know, he's 
[02:29:00]  got these huge lawsuits coming because all the concussions from those old guys, you know,  they had studies on, they knew what fucked them up.  You know, when a guy can't get out of bed for a year, there's a problem.  There's a problem.  It would just look the other way.  The only reason.  How do you argue that?  The only reason the commissioner did anything is because Congress brought him, you know,  brought him in there and goes, look, if you don't do something with these concussions  with the players, we're going to, you know, we're going to take care of it.  So that's why the commissioner all of a sudden became concerned, oh, player safety, please. 
[02:29:30]  Get the fuck out of here.  But, so, teams had this bounty thing going on for a while, huh?  Well, I'm sure they did.  That's been going on for years.  You want to knock the guy out of the game.  Right.  And what, you get a little bonus if that happens?  Believe me, if I would have known they were doing that to Brett Favre, I would have  fucking shipped in.  What's that?  I would have fucking gave him my house.  Wow.  Man, the Saints.  Wow.  But don't, the commissioner just did this just to, because there's going to be major  lawsuits. 
[02:30:00]  The NFL is going to have to pay billions and billions of dollars out to these old players  that are all fucked up.  Yeah.  So this is just to save a little face.  Look, look what we're doing.  Look, I don't take no shit.  I suspended a coach for a year.  I did all this.  So he's just trying to, you know, get a little money back because they're going to get fucking  hit hard.  Who's suing the league?  A lot of the older players?  Yeah, like Jim McMahon and guys like that that can't even, you know, got so many concussions  and just tell them to go back in the game and all that other stuff.  When the, you know, the NFL and the doctors knew, but they're just like, fuck it.  Just put them back in.  We got to win. 
[02:30:30]  Right.  Right.  Sue McMahon for the Super Bowl shuffle.  The commissioner is all concerned about player safety, but he wants to add two more games  on in a season.  All right.  Yeah.  Because they're just going to play touch football in those games.  Nobody's going to get hurt.  You don't think he's concerned about safety?  He doesn't give a fuck.  Why would he put two more games on where the guys just kill each other?  I got half a team by week eight.  Yeah.  I need two more games in a season.  Does he want to pay them more money?  My brother's a third string quarterback by week nine on the Dolphins.  Do they want to pay more money for these extra games?  No, of course.  They don't want to give them any extra money. 
[02:31:00]  Mm-hmm.  It's good how it is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But as a Jet fan, you've got to be crying because it's going to be drama-filled.  The Jets do that just for attention.  They're like a fucking fat chick in the corner.  Well, just say...  It's causing a scene.  I'm hungry.  I want to go.  Just say fat...  The Giants and the Patriots are getting all the attention at the party because they  got the fucking big pitch and they're hot and everyone's looking at their ass and  the fat one's just in the corner wallowing in her misery. 
[02:31:30]  Fucking Rex Ryan instead of the fat chick, the fat coach.  He loves the attention, huh?  Yeah, all of that stuff.  And then, you know, the owner, of course.  You know, I want the Jets on TV.  The Jets are going to be on TV four more times this year because of it.  I mean, yeah, I don't like the movie.  We couldn't find a lot of Jets fans that did this morning.  It will bring some kind of excitement to New York, obviously.  Every Jet fan is going to go, all right, Sanchez is terrible.  You know, when he starts fucking up again, they go, how could Tebow be any worse? 
[02:32:00]  That's what they're going to rationalize and go, just put him in there.  It can't be any worse.  Yeah, I don't see how they win a Super Bowl this way, but we'll see.  How are the...  Hey, Jim.  Jim, how are the...  Not you, stupid.  Sorry.  How are you...  How are the Patriots going to do this year?  Are they getting the first round draft pick?  What's happening?  No, you know, they're always going to be good.  Belichick's a freaking great coach.  They got a bunch of draft picks they freaking stockpiled, so they're going to be fine.  You think they're going to go for another Super Bowl run?  Yeah, they're always in the mix. 
[02:32:30]  I just wanted to hear you say it.  I just wanted to hear you say it.  Could you handle if they lost another Super Bowl, though, at this point?  It's getting a little rough up there.  If they lose to the Giants again, I'll never watch football again.  It's getting a little rough.  If they play the Giants in the Super Bowl game, I won't watch it.  Yeah, you will.  No, I will.  I almost didn't watch this year.  I know, Jimmy told us.  I was going to a movie.  What an unpleasant experience it was.  Yeah, Jimmy told us it just ruined the whole fucking Super Bowl party.  Matt, turn the TV off.  What?  To do what?  Just listen to you commentate with no TV on?  Was the game officially over? 
[02:33:00]  No!  It was fucking like a minute left.  Matt, turn it off.  I did that.  So really, I shouldn't watch the end of the game just to listen to you?  I did that eight minutes in.  I go, it's over.  What'd you say?  Because he's a fucking panicking idiot, and he thinks that I came to his house on Super Bowl  Sunday to eat Tostitos and watch him talk with no TV on?  A black flat screen screen.  He probably figures it as a screen screen.  Foot, foot.  My foot, foot.  Foot, foot, foot, foot.  He probably thinks if he turns off the TV, then things will change.  They will be different if you're not watching, right? 
[02:33:30]  It's happened.  Are you one of those guys?  It's happened.  Yeah.  It's happened.  The Red Sox won two World Series because I didn't watch the games.  You're convinced.  It's absolutely true.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  If you watched.  He had a lot to do with it.  I'm sure to frigging, who was the manager?  Frank Cohn, I'm sure, was on the bench going, should we bring in Papa Bond now?  Like, no, that fucking, that fat comedian, Robert Kelly, is not watching the game.  We're good.  We'll just leave the thought of it.  Hey, Jim, just to let you know, I've been losing a little weight.  No, I know you have. 
[02:34:00]  I love Jim's voice.  Are you losing weight?  I want to go back to the jerking off in the shower thing, Bobby, really fast.  Why don't you use your big fucking toe and squish that shit right through the drain?  Oh, man.  Step on my jizz?  Yeah, you move it around a little bit.  Like Play-Doh through the Fun Factory.  You fucking, you use your big toe to sweep it all toward the drain and then you squish  it through.  That shit's like the alien in Spider-Man 3.  If that touches your skin, it attaches itself to it and it winds up on your cheek.  There's no wiping it off.  Yeah, there's no wiping that off, dude.  You're going to have to have your girl take it off with a fucking... 
[02:34:30]  Ah, it's the bottom of your foot.  Who cares?  Now, it will wind up on your ear.  Trust me.  I'll be doing a set.  What's that?  It really is hard to get off of leg hair after you get out of the shower and it's like balled  up like fucking rubber cement on your leg hair and you've got to pull it.  You've got to pull out the leg hair at that point.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  It's your only choice.  It really is your only choice.  Leg hair is the worst.  How about...  This is the worst.  You know the little hairs on the top of your toes when it gets on one of those?  Oh, man.  Yeah, it hurts to pull it off.  You lick it. 
[02:35:00]  You suck it off like a lollipop.  A lollipop.  What's a lollipop?  What's a lollipop?  It's a lollipop.  It's a lollipop.  I say lolly.  I say lolly.  Well, you put a U in there like a lolly.  You still got a lot of that Boston accent.  How long have you been in New York?  I fucking can't shut your face, kid.  Okay.  I'll fucking slam the door right in your fucking head, you cocksucker.  It's really hard to get off of your asshole hair.  Oh!  That's why...  Can I just say something? 
[02:35:30]  I always feel bad when you come in a chick's hair.  I'm like, oh.  I always immediately try to just get it out immediately.  Fuck that.  I come right in her eyebrows.  Go shave.  I'm stupid.  I want her to leave my house looking like an alien.  Like she's leaving the mothership?  Yeah, exactly.  You're at the door going, oh.  Fucking cancer eyebrows.  Beat it.  I don't like when I come in a chick's hair.  I don't like it.  I feel bad.  I just feel...  I know it's just a...  It's like gum.  Something tells me if you're coming in her hair, it's her fault because she should have  had it in her mouth. 
[02:36:00]  Ah, you like coming in the chick's mouth.  I don't like that either.  I'm not really a big fan of that.  I don't like when a chick swallows the whole thing.  I feel bad about that, too.  I like intervaginal orgasms.  Intervaginal?  Yeah, I like putting it in a vagina and then you go in and out for a while.  Yeah.  And then you shoot a cum in that vagina.  Deep.  But you leave it.  Yeah, yeah.  You leave it right in there.  Really?  Deep.  Deep.  No.  Then you sit on her stomach and you fucking shoot it out like toothpaste. 
[02:36:30]  That's how you clean her out.  You fucking...  You sit on her stomach.  When I come in a chick, it immediately pours out of it.  Really?  Yeah, because it's so close to the edge.  Oh, I see what you're saying, man.  It has the consistency of tea.  Fucking shallow cum.  No sperminous.  Let's not let Florentine go.  Florentine.  Oh, Jim.  I like whacking my bag in the shower.  I used to have a bunch of roommates I live with down in Florida.  And this one guy used to take baths all the time.  He's like, don't fucking jerk off in the shower anymore. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, bath.  Of course, we didn't listen to him.  And we do, like, three of us took showers.  We were going out.  And then, like, 20 minutes later, he went in the tub.  He came running out naked because he had a load fucking stuck on his neck.  Yeah, the best part of that story is hearing Florentine's little kid while he's holding him.  Oh, shit.  Were you laughing?  That was fucking funny.  Of course.  It was hanging off his neck like a fucking booger.  It was beautiful.  It was beautiful.  Oh, that is fucking wrong, man. 
[02:37:30]  We were just laughing at a small mule because he came out.  Oh, God, Florentine.  Your girl, you know, your girl's hair falls out.  There's always hair in the drain from my chick.  Yeah.  And then your fucking jizz hits that, and it just makes.  Oh, it's like fucking.  Do you want to pick that out and eat it?  Adobe blocks.  It becomes strong like straw and clay.  You make a fucking.  Yeah.  It's like Takata.  Yeah, you make the tallest building in the world or something. 
[02:38:00]  And then, holy fuck.  Don't touch him.  Oh, God.  I always talk.  I hate doing his arm.  Oh, boy.  All right, Jim.  Thank you so much for calling, brother.  See you later, Jim.  Hey, Jim.  Jim.  Yeah.  When are you doing your one-man show again?  Oh, yeah.  Friday night in the city at the Producers Club, New York City.  Hey.  All right, cool.  And next week, the Improv and Tampa.  All right, brother.  And Mr. Jim Florentine on Twitter.  Thanks, Jim.  I'm Bob Kelly's at the Brokerage.  Yes, and I will be at Uncle Vinny's this weekend. 
[02:38:30]  And Bobby's at the Brokerage in Long Island, which I was at recently.  It's a great room in Long Island.  Really, really.  The new owners are great.  Oh, they treated me great when I went to see Bob.  Yeah, he's great, too.  I wouldn't go for the old guy at all.  I would refuse to work there.  You know, the old guy actually came up to me.  I worked there like eight years ago.  And he said, you know you have to work clean.  Yeah.  I was like, are you out of your fucking mind?  This guy doesn't give a fuck.  He runs the room really well.  It's a great place for a show.  And he's just one of those guys.  He seems like an old school guy.  And he treats the comics good.  Great.  And I will be at my uncle. 
[02:39:00]  I keep saying my cousin Vinny's.  But Uncle Vinny's Friday, Saturday.  And then next week is here in New York at Caroline's.  I want those to sell big.

This has been Primetime Sam Roberts and one question with a guest we couldn't get on The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:40:00]  Breaking news.  Oh, yeah.  Bob Kelly in studio, by the way.  He's playing the brokerage Friday and Saturday night on Long Island. 
[02:40:30]  Jeb Bush endorses Romney.  Oh, it's this morning.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We haven't talked about it yet.  Oh, yeah.  I thought that just broke.  Nah.  Oh, okay.  I never care about the endorsements.  Like, this guy now likes this guy.  Fuck Jeb Bush.  A lot of people were focusing on the Jeb Bush and who he would endorse.  Because for a while there, he wasn't going to endorse anybody, right?  That Apache helicopter fucking clip of that thing crashing is un-fucking-believable.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And this piece of shit's dead, too.  This Mohamed Farah, or Mera.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They killed this fucking fucking guy in France, right? 
[02:41:00]  Yep.  What the hell?  What?  They say cake.  What the fuck?  What are you doing?  Who's that cake?  Mini.  For me?  Mini.  Mini.  Like the Mini Cooper people?  What is that about?  Oh, they want a free plug.  This is Plugola.  It's finest.  Oh, well.  Love Plugola.  And there's balloons?  What is it?  I love it.  You're going to break.  Oh, Jesus.  Jimmy.  Jimmy jumped in the middle of the big balloon.  Holy shit.  There's a bunch of balloons. 
[02:41:30]  Jimmy just jumped in the middle of them.  Starts swinging his arms wildly.  I'm going to start riffing.  Watch this.  Hey.  Hey, look.  I'm like naming like 99 Luft balloons or something.  Oh, God.  Why does he have to touch me?  Why does he have to touch me?  Why do I have to get the chip nudge?  It's the closest person.  Because he's touched everybody.  He's nudging you to get a laugh.  That's how the chip laughs.  What kind of cake is it?  That is true.  Why don't you open it?  I'd like a sliver.  Why don't we look at the cake?  You tell him he has a kid.  Wait a minute. 
[02:42:00]  What kind of cake is it?  Hey, what kind of cake is that?  What kind of cake?  Hey, Roland.  Hey, hee.  We see you wear your Jets.  How do you do it, Ann?  Jets, Jets, Jets.  T-shirt.  What do you think of it?  Jets, New York Jets.  Yeah, yeah.  Jets, New York Jets.  What do you think of the T-bow?  I ordered my jersey.  Oh, God.  Of course he did.  Are you going to be joining Tim Sanity, Roland?  Yes.  You think it's a good move?  You watch some Jets games.  It'll be fun.  It'll be fun at the Jets games.  You sit down and hang out.  Why is it upside down?  Because he flipped it.  It accidentally flipped upside down. 
[02:42:30]  Cupcakes and cookies and stuff.  What does it look like?  I'll try this.  Yeah.  What kind of cupcakes are they?  Oh, man.  A bunch of different ones.  Oh, God.  That was cake batter.  This is Morton after you on the webcam.  Well, he's eating the frosting like it's jizz.  I don't like the fact that Bob just used my comedy as an excuse to eat cake.  Thank you.  It was so obvious to everyone, Bobby.  Look, here's Morton eating two black balls.  I got it.  The truck on cupcakes.  Here's Morton fucking a big, big, huge black chick. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, I'm stuffing a whole cake.  Yeah, here's Morton sucking a black dick.  It's a cruller.  All right, Bob.  Let's make believe you're not going for deliciousness for yourself.  I just had a fucking taste of that.  That's just stupid.  That's delicious.  That's stupid.  That's a matter of flavor.  That's stupid.  Whatever that is.  Stuffedcupcakes.com.  The icing on it is crazy.  Can we throw cupcakes at you?  Dude, I just had to fucking taste that cake batter.  What are you doing?  Dude, do you think I'm a fan?  Try the cake batter.  No, no.  It's a fan of yours.  I just saw the cupcakes, and I'm thinking, wow, can we just throw them? 
[02:43:30]  I actually did a radio show.  I think your old producer did a muffin-throwing thing at some dude.  Oh, yeah, yeah, in San Francisco.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fucking, I don't want to.  Here's the thing.  Oh, can we just get them out of the studio?  Yeah, can you think I'm out?  Because I'm sweating right now.  Yeah, take them out.  Does it smell good?  Oh, God.  We had one bite.  Dude, those Weight Watchers, I mean, not to harp on Weight Watchers, but they're fucking  three and four points.  I don't want to mush that in your face.  Oh, wow.  If you didn't have gorilla strength, Roland, I'd mush that right in your throat.  And mental abilities. 
[02:44:00]  He really is.  He's waving it under Bobby's nose.  Slat-back Hawaiian.  Gorilla strength.  He's the angry panda.  Roland's wiping frosting on Bobby's face.  I'm going to go home and have a nice fucking four-point fucking delicious ice cream fucking  candy bar.  Four points from Weight Watchers.  Really, Nana?  They're really good.  Yes.  I know.  But you know what?  Life sucks.  My friend Jim, who I've looked up to my whole fucking career, banging hookers, eat whatever  he wants, making money. 
[02:44:30]  I'm going home to have a four-point.  It's hard to say.  I want to eat one of those, but I'm afraid it will start me down that road.  I could eat one right now, but I don't want to fucking start.  The Weight Watchers is working for Jimmy, too, I've noticed.  How do you notice it?  Drop some LB.  Thank you.  Nana, is that good?  Thank you.  Is it good?  Are you fucking kidding me?  There's a goddamn mini Oreo on top.  What are you doing?  Oh, Bobby, how bad do you want that?  Why fucking put it on top?  The bed is bad.  You know what's really bad is I'm going to Reno next two weeks, and it says on the fucking 
[02:45:00]  stuff that they send you from the hotel, nightlife, prostitution is legal.  Figure it out.  Oh, man.  I'm going where prostitution is legal for the first time in my life.  That's rough, right?  What am I going to do?  Nothing.  What am I going to fucking do?  You're a married man.  You can't do nothing.  I'm just going to be eating fucking chocolate, shooting guns.  That's all I'm going to do.  Yeah, you can do that.  I'm going to fight at gun range and fucking stuff my fat face with dark chocolate for 
[02:45:30]  the antioxidants.  Stuff your face while you're at the gun range.  Yeah, with bullets.  Just shoot yourself in the fucking head and die.  That's subtle.  Oh, God.  Now he's pushing them again.  You could do that, though, in Vegas.  That was half Norton, half Chip.  It really was.  I wasn't.  You could do that in Vegas or Reno.  You go there and just go to a range.  You rent the guns.  You can rent whatever you want.  Wow.  They got some range in Vegas where you could get to fucking sit there with a 50 cal. 
[02:46:00]  Such a ripoff.  Oh, I heard.  Yeah.  I want to do a Colt, like a six shooter.  A six shooter?  Yeah.  Like an old Colt Western style.  Yeah.  I want to see if they have the holster, too.  So you do a quick draw?  Shoot your fucking foot off?  Yeah, that's tough.  Those things must be powerful, though.  Shoot one of those guns.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  45.  I have two of them.  Must be hard.  That's a 90.  I have.  Just get one 90. 
[02:46:30]  I have the Ruger Vaquero double.  Two of them.  They're matched.  And I need a holster for it, though.  I need the two fucking on each side.  Spin the guns.  Walk around your house naked with that.  You're listening to the young guns theme.  Hey, are you going to fucking...  Regulators!  Just your cock swinging around like a shemale.  Are you going to get the double barrel handgun?  No, I don't like that one.  It's a .45 that shoots.  It's double barrel. 
[02:47:00]  Right.  It's like a regular .45 caliber 1911 model gun, but it has two barrels.  It's like, why do you need two bullets going to the same place at the same time?  That's the beauty.  In case one misses.  But they're right there next to each other.  Did you get the new split shot that actually shoots them in two different directions?  You can aim it?  No, they don't make it.  Around the corner.  Shoot around the corner.  Around the corner.  Are you into classic guns at all?  A little bit, but I like contemporary guns better than the classics.  Really?  You don't like a gun with a good patina? 
[02:47:30]  No, no.  I like old rifles, old military World War II rifles, M1 Garand and stuff like that.  A sharp?  A sharp?  A sharp.  No, I like the Garand.  Oh, that's old Call of Duty.  Remember that when you run out in Call of Duty?  Yeah, yeah.  You're like, fuck.  It was great if you were the one with it and I was the one without it because I'd hear you  be out of ammo and I'd hear exactly where you are as you run out of ammo.  Yeah, I like that.  I like the old Mausers, the German Mausers, things like that. 
[02:48:00]  But as far as pistols go, I'll take a modern fucking H&K or SIG like that.  Modern, new.  They used to make those guns really, really good though.  I mean...  Oh, yeah.  But they were fucking crazy.  You carry around an M1 Garand and you shoot it, you realize that motherfucker had to hump  that thing around.  They weigh a ton.  They're fucking...  They kick like a mule.  There's nothing on that thing to keep it from just slamming into your shoulder. 
[02:48:30]  That was when men were men.  Yeah.  They had to carry around a heavy gun and a shovel.  That thing weighed a ton.  Yeah.  But it was accurate.  Really accurate.  Yeah.  At a long distance.  They're pretty accurate now though, the guns.  And they're a lot lighter.  Which one are you saying, Bobby, was accurate?  Well, the M16, the first M16 that they replaced those with, I think, right?  Oh, those were terrible.  They were terrible.  What's this one?  What is that one?  That's an M1.  Yeah, they used that in World War II and Korea to some extent.  They're long range and they're real powerful.  Great gun.  Too expensive to make. 
[02:49:00]  Too heavy.  How far could they shoot?  17 feet.  Oh, that's not that far.  I thought it was a lot farther than that.  What are you, 20 feet away?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was trench warfare.  Yeah.  You really had to be close.  Look at that.  Now, what's the fucking next gun?  Is that it?  That's the next gun?  That's craziness right there.  What the fuck is that?  Jesus, look at that thing.  I like the scar.  Do you have one of those?  That's a nice new gun that's pretty fun to shoot.  Do you have one of those?  No, I don't have one of those.  What is that?  Wow.  There's the speech gun that fucks up your speech that they invented in Japan. 
[02:49:30]  Seriously.  Sounds like a joke.  Nope.  It fires.  It's a sound thing.  It's called the Voss.  It fires slobber and retardation at you.  Holy shit.  That's funny.  No, it fires what you say, your own voice.  It fires it back at you very, very quickly.  And it fucks people up if they hear what they're saying back a millisecond or something after.  Why are you kidding me?  What would that do?  Why do you need that?  It's a weird way to crowd control. 
[02:50:00]  It's a sound thing.  A less lethal form of a...  What if it's a quiet crowd?  Yeah.  I don't know how it works, but if you look it up, it doesn't exist.  Okay, if there's a big crowd and they say...  Well, if it's a quiet crowd, then it's the brokerage.  Tomorrow is set up.  Oh, that ain't even right.  Why?  I plugged them.  They did plug me.  That gun, that's the one that has those rounds.  They're actually a computerized round where you can set the range on the round itself. 
[02:50:30]  And if somebody's in a building, you could shoot the round into a window, and if they're  hiding underneath the window, the round will explode right when it gets in the window and  kill everyone in the fucking room.  See, that's what I'm talking about.  Craziness.  That's fucking great.  Wow.  That's fucking great.  They actually have guns now that will put on hats and knock on your front door.  Yes, very dangerous.  They do have bullets that will find individual people, right?  No, that's that movie with Gene Simmons. 
[02:51:00]  Sorry.  With the robots.  Again, I'm sorry.  Gene Simmons was in that, and Magnum P.I. was in it.  I think you're talking about Fifth Element.  No, no, with the little robot things.  Oh, Larry Selleck.  No, Tom Selleck.  Runaway, that's what it was called.  But they do have bullets that have little things on the end of them.  Things.  They have those.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They're like little feathers.  You immediately think it's going to tickle you, and you're like, aww, and you put your chin  out.  And then the bullet goes through your neck. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah.  It's a feather bullet.  Look at that.  Look at that.  That's...  Look at that.  That's from fucking...  That's from the Fifth Element, yeah.  They don't have that.  They do have that.  They don't have that.  Dude, that's called the fucking wrist rocket.  That has the speech gun in it.  A speech gun.  The speech gun.  We want rights.  Let's go home.  People say the PS...  Is it the PS 2000 I got?  That's fucking crazy.  That looks like...  That looks like that. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, I have one of those.  That's a crazy gun right there.  You have that?  Yeah.  Why do you have that?  Because it's fun to shoot.  Wow.  It's fun to shoot.  That's crazy.  You went with guns, Opie went with a baby, and Norton went with hookers.  What you guys spend your money on is just fucking...  Yeah, it's my hookers.  It really shows who you are.  Yeah, that's the one, yeah.  You don't buy hookers?  That thing's pisser.  Look at that.  It's a bullpup.  It's very short.  Do I have that?  You could shoot a .223 round out of it as fast as you can pull the trigger. 
[02:52:30]  Can you put your iPhone in the back there?  Is there a little case for your iPhone and your wallet?  Yes, actually, the back does flip up, and you could store little things in there.  Little doodads and tickets.  Yeah, your hummos.  You can put your hummos and whatever you got in there.  Little knickknacks.  Sure, little things.  Or just to put in there and save them and show your kids.  Sure, sure.  I have a collection of Beanie Babies I keep in the back of my fucking gun.  I used to carry marbles just so people would say, you lost your marbles.  I'd go, no, I didn't.  They're right here.  We'd all laugh.  You're real hoot. 
[02:53:00]  I always had a Tic Tac because in case I got bad breath.  Oh, that's always good to have.  A Tic Tac's always good to have.  It's a good way to talk to people.  You go, hey, would you like a Tic Tac?  I've got extras.  We always start this about this time.  Every day now, it's like, ah, come on.  It's called giving up.  Wrapping up.  I'm still thinking about those cupcakes.  They're outside.  Did you see that shit in the Cold War?  All the shit that they had?  Oh, yeah.  The snowball fights?  Not that one, Jimmy.  They had an umbrella with a gun and it shot a little BB out. 
[02:53:30]  But inside of the BB, they put like...  Ricin.  Yeah, did you see that?  I saw that.  Yep.  They could just...  They got that fucking...  Who'd they get you?  Why don't they have that shit anymore?  The Chechnyan president or something?  Who'd they get with that?  They got a reporter.  No, no.  It wasn't a reporter.  They got a fucking...  On the thing I saw, they got a reporter.  They actually...  The guy's face started melting.  The guy's face is terrible stuff, man.  Yeah, the guy got the flu.  That's why I don't eat Chinese food.  Oh, here he goes. 
[02:54:00]  Bobby's getting touched.  You all right, Bobby?  Oh, God.  He's touching his chest now.  Yes, pal.  What are you doing?  I'm not.  I'm not.  You can't beat Chip.  No.  In any form.  No.  Chip wins.  Valley Girl Chip.  Chip, what's the southern one again?  Dick Chipperson?  Dippy Chipperson?  Or Chippy Dipperson?  Dickerson?  No, Chip Dickerson.  I don't know nothing.  People liked Chip Linde yesterday.  Oh, God.  Chip Linde.  He was doing Paul Linde.  I had Chip doing Paul Linde.  It was terrible. 
[02:54:30]  Look at you eating your bananas all.  Yeah, I forgot about it.  Oh, yeah.  Look at you eating your ball.  What did your hair do?  Run away or something?  No.  I kind of like that one.  I forgot about it.  Yeah, that one isn't as abrasive, believe it or not.  Oh, my God.  You are so grody.  No.  That's what I'm going to like.  Oh, God.  It's time to go home.  It's time to go home.  I'm not going to fucking sit here while fucking Valley Jimmy. 
[02:55:00]  Hi, Sean.  Sean, what are you, Sean all over the place or something?  Oh, God.  We should go to the fucking Medieval Times.  Oh, I went there once with Eastside Dave and a bunch of people.  It was very fun.  What happened?  He jumped around?  Yeah, he fell down.  He went and shit on the horse's shit.  He picked up the horse shit and ate it.  I love that guy.  So, yeah, where is Medieval Times?  Jersey.  Is it good?  Maybe.  Yeah, the food is good.  Go to Medieval Times. 
[02:55:30]  Try the veal.  It's the best in the castle.  I'm surprised they don't have a comic do something stupid there.  Yeah, like jest around or something with bells on your shoes.  I'm going to speak oldie time to Arthur.  What a gross respect to sword in this stone.  Yeah, it's fun, you know.  You know, you get no silverware.  No, but they give you, like, finger food.  It's not like you're eating fucking noodles.  But they feed you a lot.  They get soup.  Oh, you know what? 
[02:56:00]  I could have had more.  How do you eat the soup?  Drink it.  You just gotta drink your soup.  And then you get the big fucking cup of grog.  But they usually give you, like, chicken, so you eat it with your hands anyway.  Is it good, though?  No, it's for your regular.  You're not fucking, you know.  Your hands get dirty.  You're not fine dining.  You're not at Peter Luger's.  Right.  I want to go to Peter Luger's.  You're watching a Renaissance fair.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't worry about the food.  No one wants to do everything we bring up.  I want to go to Peter Luger's. 
[02:56:30]  Peter Luger's.  I know one thing I don't want to do this Friday, Saturday.  Oh, shit.  Because I'm working.  Oh, shit.  Such a fucking cunt.  It really is.  He plugs his friends like he hates them.  Oh, yeah.  The ricin guy.  That's his friend.  What was his name?  The age of 49.  The cause of death was poisoning from ricin's pill pellet.  Yeah, those things are crazy.  They'll get you.  They don't do that shit anymore.  A small red pimple had formed at the site of the sting.  He felt like a sting he felt earlier. 
[02:57:00]  And the pain had not lessened or stopped.  Told at least one of his colleagues at the BBC about the incident.  That evening, he developed a fever, was admitted to the hospital.  He died three days later.  Yeah.  Man, talk about being able to get away, too.  Like, three days later.  A reporter there?  Yeah, it was a reporter.  But the guy fucked up.  He heard the guy drop his umbrella.  Because you know the guy, I guess the guy shot him and probably got nervous and dropped his umbrella.  Hubna, hubna.  He goes, I turned around and saw a dude picking up his umbrella.  And that was the mechanism. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, they have the little thing in the end.  The little tiny ball bearing that's hollowed out.  They put the ricin in the middle of it.  And then there's a little trigger.  And it shot it right in the back of his calf.  That's how gangbangers should do it.  Y'all, I'm a Mary Poppins, you ass.  Yo, son, I'll point her umbrellas sideways.  Y'all, I'm a penguin, you motherfucker from the original Batman.  Yo, spoon full of sugar, motherfuckers. 
[02:58:00]  It's surprising that there's no more people fucking doing that crazy shit.  I'm dying to get a ricin umbrella.  Shoot audience members with it.  I was just helping you.  See you later, Kev.  Aww.  Yeah.  After every, aw.  Yeah, take your umbrellas.  Fucking throw ricin.  I want to throw ricin to people, like, at a wedding.  Oh, I thought you said ricin.  Yeah, yeah, that would be good.  Ricin beans.  They're all fucking three days later, just dead. 
[02:58:30]  Fucking fist somebody with ricin on your knuckles.  The fuck is wow.  Watch that pussy fall out.  That pussy looks like a mouth at a fucking failed suicide attempt with a shotgun.  Yeah, shit.  And there it is.  Yeah, that's it.  You calling it?  And there it is.  Jimmy just touched me with his pinky.  I mean, Don, I mean, what are we doing here?  It's getting silly.  Look at the hairdo on that guy on TV.  That's the worst fucking plastic man haircut.  Oh, God.  Well, you know, he doesn't have many options. 
[02:59:00]  You know what I mean?  I'd love any hair.  Aww.  Aww, sweetie.  It's so sad.  I'd love hair again.  Are you going to grow hair again?  I can't.  You said you were going to grow hair again.  Not now.  You were going to try?  Not now.  Why don't you wear a piece totally seriously for a few months?  That would be fucking hilarious.  I would do it, but it's so expensive.  I mean, a good toupee and to get it hooked up.  A good treatment to one of those, it's not like a wig.  It's called a system.  It's a system.  It's a system.  A hair system.  How much is a good wig?  A good rug?  I don't know.  You know who has a good one? 
[02:59:30]  Fucking, like, Shatner.  Because isn't Shatner...  You can't tell.  What?  I don't think you can tell when he's in here.  No, you can't.  Believe me, I was looking like, he's got it now down.  Because he used to have that giant TJ Hooker fucking mane.  And you could tell, like, toward the end of Star Trek and shit, he was kind of losing it.  But when he comes in here, you can't tell.  Now he's got, like, the reasonable length, the reasonable color for his age and everything.  And you can't...  The hairline, it's fucking all there.  I don't get it.  Let's get you one.  How old is he now?  81?  81. 
[03:00:00]  81 today.  Hair system?  Let's get it.  One hair system.  Bobby, try a hair system.  You know, Rogan just shaved his head.  Yes, he did.  What?  What does he look like?  He said he tapped out.  He fucking tapped out and he looks great.  He fucking shaved his head.  Is there a picture of that yet?  He actually got the transplant.  Yeah, he had gotten the transplant.  So he's got the little scar on the back.  And it didn't take.  It didn't take, really?  Yeah.  How long ago did he get it done?  I don't know.  He must have went old school.  Just a couple weeks.  It looks great.  It looks awesome.  Such a relief to shave your head.  What if... 
[03:00:30]  You know, when you're losing it...  I want to see what he looks like.  Having to make your hair.  Just like, no more...  Having to make it.  Having to, like, fill in the gaps.  Make your hair.  Yeah.  It's fucking awful.  Yeah, Rogan just went with the shave.  Yeah, you got it right there.  It looks great.  He can pull it off.  He's got it.  He can pull it off, man.  He's got the look.  Yeah, it looks great.  He's a maniac.  Yeah.  Looks fucking great.  Looks like a fucking homicidal maniac.  Yeah.  He said he's got the scar of shame on the back of his head.  The scar of shame.  Is that what he called it?  The scar of shame.  That's why I never got... 
[03:01:00]  Let me say...  That's why I never did that.  Because I never wanted to...  I figured they'd come up with a pill or something.  A pill?  Yeah, he fucking looks like Randy Couture.  And he's just being taunted by fucking Ari Shaffir, who's got, like, the fucking chupacabra  next to him.  Yeah, he's got that fucking...  Fuck yeah, it looks all right, man.  Yeah, it looks great.  Yeah, Rogan.  Yeah, he pulls it off.  Yeah, he's shooting.  Yeah, and he's fucking...  I mean, Jesus Christ.  He's got a cane from Kung Fu.  Not one ounce of body fat on him.  Yeah.  That always helps.  Do you mean me or him?  No, you have body fat.  I know. 
[03:01:30]  Now he's got to look like Kung Fu.  Jimmy just disgusted.  All right, Bobby, it's the Brokerage, Friday and Saturday.  Yeah, Brokerage, Friday, Saturday.  One show Friday.  And Jimmy's at Uncle Vinny's.  Yes.  Two show Saturday.  And then Caroline's next weekend.  Yes.  I'm looking forward to Uncle Vinny's, though.  Where is it?  Which one?
