<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a raunchy discussion about the British Royal Family, sparked by Prince William's engagement.  The hosts engaged in highly offensive and sexually explicit speculation about Prince Charles's infidelity, Prince Harry's paternity, and the family's perceived inbreeding and lack of societal contribution.  They then shifted to sharing stories about their ex-girlfriends' reactions to Princess Diana's death, followed by a scathing critique of *The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills*, focusing on Camille Grammer's behavior and targeting other cast members like Paris Hilton's aunt and Kim Richards.  A caller, Jeff from Massachusetts, briefly offered factual information about the Queen's duties, before studio intern Tom was subjected to a lengthy, offensive interview about his photography, social life (including interactions with Lady Gaga and Eminem), and work as a personal assistant. The hosts peppered the discussion with racially charged jokes targeting Tom.  The segment concluded with a return to discussions about the Royal Family and the *Real Housewives*.

The show then moved on to announcements of upcoming appearances. Adam Ferrara was announced as an in-studio guest, and his new History Channel shows (including *Top Gear*) were discussed, along with jokes about his driving abilities.  Other upcoming guests included Lewis Black (who recently appeared in a pistachio commercial), Snooki (also in a commercial), and Eddie Money.  The hosts reminisced about Eddie Money's previous "bitter" appearance and Derek's enthusiastic reaction to meeting him.  A news story about a man removed from a Delta flight for his "Adam Bomb" tattoo was recounted, followed by a mysterious caller's story involving a murdered commodity broker and two suspiciously deceased associates, hinting at his involvement and subsequent NYPD career.  The conversation shifted to Chaz Bono's appearance, the hosts’ own drinking habits (including blackouts), and the dangers of excessive alcohol consumption, leading to a discussion of PSAs (particularly Canadian ones), often employing offensive language.  Adam Ferrara then joined the show, discussing his upcoming appearances and projects, including his experiences with Buzz Aldrin, Michelle Rodriguez, Tim Allen, Kid Rock, and Bret Michaels on *Top Gear*, and reminiscing about a "Comics Come Home" performance.

The next segment centered on comedian Stephen Wright, with anecdotes about encounters with Ralph Macchio and a lengthy, graphic discussion about Jeffrey Dahmer.  The hosts shared stories from their youth, including roommate conflicts and escapades with a friend nicknamed "Bison."  Musical guest Eddie Money then arrived, joining the conversation about his career, Long Island, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Jimmy Norton shared numerous childhood stories and difficult experiences, punctuated by crude humor and graphic descriptions of Dahmer's crimes.  He also discussed difficulties navigating social situations, particularly interactions with crying women.  The hosts and Eddie Money continued to share jokes and stories about their lives in the entertainment industry.

Eddie Money remained the main guest for an extended period, discussing various topics including his family's backstage behavior, his large dogs (and his wife’s disapproval), his wife's spending habits, his management's attempts to remove comedic elements from his shows, his wife's strong religious beliefs and reactions to his female fans, his struggles with sobriety, his charitable work (donations to veterans' widows and the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation), a bizarre medical exam story, his daughter’s struggles with substance abuse, and another humorous anecdote involving a doctor's new couch.  Lewis Black then joined the conversation, discussing his book ("I'm Dreaming of a Black Christmas"), commercials, and Glenn Beck.  Both Eddie Money and Lewis Black shared personal anecdotes about relationships and infidelity.  The conversation also touched upon the prevalence of bed bugs and Eddie Money’s multiple experiences with crabs.  The discussion was filled with profanity, sexually suggestive comments, and dark humor.  Adam Ferrara's upcoming comedy show dates were also announced.

The final segment featured discussions of past relationships, with the hosts reflecting on relationship lengths and difficulties maintaining friendships with exes.  They joked about missed sexual opportunities. The show then moved to promotional announcements for Louis Black (his book and shows), Adam Ferrara (Gotham Comedy Club appearances), Eddie Money (acoustic Christmas tour), Jimmy's Poughkeepsie and Borgata shows, and a problematic promotional photo.  Jimmy also announced a Bar 9 performance with his brother. The segment concluded with an Eddie Money song, seemingly a patriotic ballad.  The entire segment contained considerable vulgar language.

[00:01:00]  william oh you know what he's not even wrong oops oops actually it's princess charles yes  he had a real son though prince william yeah uh got engaged and i'm asking the room in general why  do we give a shit why does england give a shit yeah and then all of a sudden we we showed each  other we give a shit with all the knowledge we know about this and the entire royal family yeah  it's like the the question was posed like who cares like who would keep tabs on what's going on 
[00:01:30]  and then we all proceeded to throw in our knowledge of the royal family we couldn't wait to get our  little tidbits out there for each other the queen mum and everything and prince uh charles and why he  won't be the king and and illegitimate harry and prince philip the cuckold the cuckold queen england's  uh queen elizabeth's uh he's her her box eater yeah her prince philip oh prince philip good old prince  philip and how lousy a fuck prince charles must have been because lady die was fucking unclipped arab 
[00:02:00]  cock prince charles must have been awful because his dick would probably smell bad after a round of  cricket it's not like horse saddle yes and then fox hunting actually it was polo and ox cricket's the  one you play with the bat i'm glad i don't know that good yeah good enough though i'm sure he played  some cricket in his day what else does he have to do what does he do nothing to deserve our attention  he bees the prince and then one of his sons is not even his but no one wants to acknowledge it it 
[00:02:30]  doesn't look like him and every time like a reporter or journalist tries to go down that road  they're either killed the car goes off a cliff or something their helicopter crashes i don't know  but but the one son looks exactly like that james hewitt really like it's an exact an exact replica but  no one wants to acknowledge this we're gossiping about the royal family we're gossiping gerties  because it's infuriating this what did this family ever do for mankind what do they do uh yeah they live 
[00:03:00]  in big huge castles yeah and they have an entire country kiss their ass it's for what it's pretty  much what we uh our version of celebrities yeah but they got celebrities this goes way beyond yeah  but it's very small country so they need it and it's a throwback to their fucking days when they  used to rule the whole world and shit and prince prince harry has red hair like this james hewitt he has  the exact same fucking eyes the same nose and the same smile yeah how are they keeping that under wraps 
[00:03:30]  looks nothing like charles charles who started going fucking bald at 17 or something and william did  too and william's got the hairline of prince charles but this guy's got a full head of red hair  right but we're not supposed to acknowledge that something is amiss there don't uh because they  the bloodlines what pure oh yeah that's great pure bloodlines fucking inbred uh uh retardation in  the royal family yeah i don't we we give this no respect none right no no not at all but a bunch of 
[00:04:00]  these uh news outlets are sending their their best people over there to to cover the engagement of  prince william are they are they going to do like uh the big because their engagements do they last long  i don't even fucking know it's gonna be another one of these big like hoopla weddings oh yeah they're  saying it could be the biggest tv event ever no way that's what they're saying yeah bigger than charles  and die i don't think it's possible because when uh charles and die here we are continuing our 
[00:04:30]  discussion i know nothing wrong with with three or four lactating fucking women talking about this at  6 a.m when those when those two nothings got married there were only three tv channels i think  maybe four oh you know yeah you're right it was so how could this be a bigger event much longer time  ago i don't know whatever i guess i guess they're bored over there i think a lot more ugliness has  been seen about the royal family too like it was not as romantic as it used to be 30 years ago you know 
[00:05:00]  after her death people really loved her after diana's death it just the royal family people like  she sucked no she was why did everyone love her she was trying to clean up landmines or something  she was stuck in this marriage why why are you stuck in this marriage leave oh you can't why can't  you leave because you're royalty it's hard to leave it's hard to leave a guy who might be king  the royal family she should have left she was nice though i hate kidding i hate those documentaries or 
[00:05:30]  whatever those uh exposés where they talk about how she suffered in the marriage shut up oh she's  yeah that's a lot of suffering she was a little bird in a gilded cage really then app why don't you  go fucking fly somewhere else she did to fucking finally find some arab yeah eventually and then  prince uh charles showed his uh true colors and married a what i think is more a man than most of  us in this room oh that that life they hit look we bring some new things in too see see this is by the 
[00:06:00]  way all we don't know about the royal family and we know everything yeah but see we do it the way  it should be done the american media should not be kissing this family's ass they're a bunch of  nobodies that have done nothing camilla bowles she is a man mary poppins or some shit you think  where's this uh where's this chick that uh prince uh williams is gonna uh she's right marry she's  i would assume she's i she would uh what's her name kate middleton yeah kate middleton kate middleton

[00:24:30]  star  i was trying to  figure out what  show she was on  was there something  called uh what was  it witch mountain  or something like  that  escape from  witch mountain  you know the uh  the blonde in that  the little blonde girl  blonde that used to  actually be on nanny  and the professor  that's what i was  thinking that broad is  now an old broad  and she's part of the  housewives  she put a movie out in  the 80s where she had  like crimped hair and  shit and kind of  looked good for three  seconds  um dude how do you  know that  i don't know because i i  thought she was kind of  uh hot in that movie 
[00:25:00]  but i just i'm talking  about an obscure  that's her  yeah that's her  i'm talking about her  and and how do you  have knowledge on her  uh i don't even  remember what what  what she starred in  as a kid  i was i was in love  with her as a kid  what was your name  well you wouldn't be  in love with the uh  the current version  of her  i'm trying to think  of her uh her name  that's jack nicholson  hit the button back  oh it's the wrong  person  that's jack nicholson  uh yeah we need  any pics of her uh 
[00:25:30]  now see what she  looks like  kim richards  that was it  kim richards  that's her  yeah  and uh  like i said she had  a movie in the 80s  where she looked  pretty good  yeah that's her  yeah she's on this  how is she even  like i haven't heard  hide nor hair  of her  that's that's years  ago too  really  yeah she doesn't  look like that  at all  she's one of the  real housewives  of uh beverly hills  yeah i mean  yeah  and the guy she was  with in escape 
[00:26:00]  from witch mountain  um he was um  the guy in star trek  the wrath of khan  that was in the  engineering section  scotty's nephew  that winds up  getting killed  and grabs captain  kirk's little lapel  there and gets  blood on it  you know that's not  even cool  that's just creepy  you know that shit  yeah it really is  i know  i just watched so much  television and movies  and stuff  my mommy just placed me  in front of the tv  and left me there  loopy in uh new york 
[00:26:30]  loopy  hey how you doing  what's up loop  all right uh  what's it called  um my wife watches  all these fucking  housewife shows  one tuck  one no tuck loopy  all right  and either call me  a good husband  or a faggot  for watching them  with her  take your pick  i know  yeah  good husband  and a faggot  if you're a good  husband you are  a faggot  misogynistic anthony  you know  it's just anthony  yes of course  and a lovely good morning  it's just anthony 
[00:27:00]  i'm breathing jim  might be redundant  there's a lot of tv  shows if you watch  you could certainly  use the faggot word  but i think  real housewives  of beverly hills  i think i think  you kind of get a pass  because it's it's  it's unbelievable  yeah  what these women  are all about  what loopy  sorry about that  i can't i can't  stand most of the  bitches on the show  nothing nothing  but there was this  great shot of  kelsey grammar's wife  talking about how  she gave up  everything i was  i was with him  when when he was 
[00:27:30]  going through rehab  and i gave up  everything to be with  him and god bless  the director  right after she said  that they cut to  an exterior shot of  their five bedroom  vacation villa in  fucking a wife  yeah  ah the poor girl  yeah they're not  fucking around with  this show  they know she's a  lunatic and she's  just an asshole  and they're and  they're editing it  properly instead of  giving her a pass  so they put their  foot in their mouth  and then they kind  of show  oh yeah  she talks about  how tough her life  is she has two  nannies and she has  assistants she took 
[00:28:00]  a phone call at  some kind of like  get together at her  mansion her beverly  hill mansion  get together  and then when the  phone call was done  she goes hey  i forgot the lady's  name she goes hey  could you take this  there's a lady that  holds her cell phone  for her and then  she goes back in to  talk about how  tough her life is  she has two nannies  per child  whose kid is this  kelsey's  kelsey's wife has  two nannies  kelsey's wife  kelsey's yeah  yeah i said that  yeah she's got so  much help for two  kids and she doesn't  even really see or 
[00:28:30]  raise her own kids  and then she's  talking about how  tough it is to be a  mom i wonder if  that's why he pays for  all that because he  thinks she's such a  vapid idiot he  doesn't want her he  wants somebody else  you know i mean maybe  because she's such a  fucking annoyance he  wants somebody else  there she's the worst  it's unbelievable how  bad this woman is it's  just uh i'm just  enraged by it  that's good that's  good how about  how about things how  about things work  yeah that's supposed to  be  see what what is  but it doesn't work

[00:56:30]  said come to the front of the plane  at first he thought  ooh I'm getting an upgrade  no  he was temporarily asked  to step off the plane  and learn that another passenger  reported him  for suspicious behavior  and noted that he had the words  Adam bomb  tattooed across his fingers  Pearson explained that  the tattoo referred to  a childhood nickname  after a few more questions  Pearson who frequented  Delta passengers  and flown more than  142,000 miles  with the airline  this year alone 
[00:57:00]  was allowed to return  to his seat  he was shocked  some people  are just  I mean I understand  in this day and age  you're supposed to look  you're supposed to say  something  but I mean  come on  Adam bomb  on your fucking  hand  and what are you  a terrorist  one person  big head of red hair  and a big red beard  sorry he doesn't look  very terroristic  it's like Dave  got thrown off a plane

[00:58:30]  and the only  uh  way he could bring up  some money  two of his brokers  were insured  had life insurance  that if anything  happened to them  this guy would collect  because it would  affect his business  so within two weeks  time  both of his employers  one was thrown off  of uh  uh  hotel in  florida  that was paid for  by the boss  and the other one  uh  took a couple of bullets  full accident  yeah  so uh 
[00:59:00]  was this ever reported  or are you  going somewhere  we don't really feel  like being involved  uh  well that's why  i'm not giving my name  because uh  no it wasn't reported  they were deemed  uh suicides  this guy sounds like  maybe he  was there  when the guy was  flung off the rooftop  exactly  exactly  he's Danny Aiello  from Fort Apache  that was great  how close were you  to the action  oh  let's just say  you know  i kind of  thought for my own health

[01:09:30]  were you  were you  completely  conscious of  what you  were doing  there  there's a  uh maybe  i don't know  because there's  a couple  no by the  way  there are  a couple  of photos  that i do  not remember  being part  of that  night  a couple  of hours  there's a  halloween  party that  you don't  remember  exactly  uh did  you wind up  up uh  hanging out  because i  reached the  point where  i don't  remember  i stayed up  to like  five o'clock  in the  morning  just like  in your  theater  watching like  i think 
[01:10:00]  buffy the  vampire slayer  and i  couldn't sleep  so i just  sat there  and just  like passed  out  how do  you guys  not think  that blacking  out is a  problem  because that's  just hanging  out  that's just  like drinking  that's how  you know  that you  drink  yeah  like if  you black  out and  you just  like pass  out in  a chair  um that's  good if  you black  out and  you wake  up and  there's  you know  little  little lace  fucking  thing in 
[01:10:30]  your grill  of your  car and  some blood  do you ever  wake up and  go like  what the  fuck  like you  ever wake  up with  that feeling  of dread  like uh-oh  like i said  something or  did something  humiliating  monday morning  every day  pretty much  that's the worst  yeah i don't  really remember how  i got home on  sunday  oh really  no no no i  didn't drive  who did  uh my cousin  did we were  at the bar  yeah but he  wasn't drinking  that much  compared to  you  are you grading  that on a  curve  yeah i don't i 
[01:11:00]  don't remember how i  got home sunday  so i woke up  monday like  wow  like what  happened  yesterday  afternoon  there are  certain  instances where  you will just  drink to the  point of uh  at the time  everything's fine  you remember  everything and  then the next  morning you  kind of have  to put the  pieces together  and be like  oh yeah  oh yeah  that person  came over  and oh  yeah  yeah  what's going  on  and that  probably isn't  the healthiest  thing i  wouldn't think  no it's not  that's like  one of the  signs right  that's one 
[01:11:30]  of the real  that's five  of the signs  is that  i was like  is that one  of the signs  questions three  through eight  on the questionnaire  and uh  lately too i  haven't been  trying to drink  a lot so  like during  the week i  won't try to  drink but  like when  friday comes  yeah it's  ten times  worse now  you just  make up for  it you just  make up for  everything you  miss during  the week  i'm so excited  to be able to  drink and i  don't think that  anybody who  drinks is an  alcoholic or  everybody who  gets drunk  a lot of  people like to  just party once  in a while  sure however  i'm talking  to three  blackout 
[01:12:00]  drinkers  consistent  blackout  drinkers  i'm not being  crazy about it  no it it is  uh you know  it does get to  the point where  um yeah  there are nights  though where  i'll be having  a few beers  and uh and  just think like  you know what  what am i doing  why have another  like i'm ready  to get another  one just out of  force of habit  like it's one of  those things  that you just  want to have  a beer and  and keep  drinking  yeah  and then you  realize  yes there's a 
[01:12:30]  word for that  we understand  that yes i do  understand there's  a word for it  but then i  realize uh  like what am i  doing i'm not  drinking to get  drunk  yeah  i do like the  taste of beer  but i don't have  to like the taste  of apple juice  too it's not  like i'm gonna  have a fucking  apple juice from  five in the  afternoon till  midnight  yeah  uh but i  don't know  what is it  what is it  just that  there's alcohol  in it  well it's a  chemical and  physical and 
[01:13:00]  spiritual addiction  to escape  somebody once  said to me  can you imagine  if broccoli did  to you  what alcohol  like if you  ate broccoli  and then you  risk getting  arrested and  throwing up all  over yourself  and blacking out  you'd never eat  broccoli again  never  but what is it  about the  wonderfulness of  booze  it's any of that  stuff it's weird  but it's a  whole like  social thing  though or  or a whole  thing where  you just to  have the  the drink in  your hand  and just  taking those  those sips  and then it's 
[01:13:30]  empty and you're  like well i  need another  one but you  don't need that  as you're not  a guy who's  shy like you  talk for like  you don't need  like you can  for you you  don't need it  as a social  lubricant  no no i  don't need to  to drink in  order to like  be able to get  over some kind  of shyness or  or anything  like this  derrick pissing  all over my  toilet is the  seat even up  yeah  or you're just  or you're just  pissing on my  toilet bowl  you can see the  stream  oh okay  i like it  it's impressive  no hands  we're pissing  like me 
[01:14:00]  rollercoaster  styles  he's got his  he's pissing  in in my  downstairs bathroom  with no hands  his hands are  over his head  and you can see  the stream of  piss  and you are  hitting the  bowl  not bad  exactly  it's like a  little baby  dick though  it's just  pointy in one  direction  i don't know  it's just one  of those things  you don't want  to just  i don't know  you're just like  oh that beer's  empty  i'll get another  one  why not  well if i have  like a six pack  now and i'm  like oh i'm 
[01:14:30]  gonna only have  like a three or  four beers or  whatever  yeah  i'll like look  at the remaining  two in the  fridge and feel  like well they  can't be there  by themselves  like they're  lonely  they have to  because it's  stupid to leave  two beers in  the fridge  exactly  it is  it's dumb  because you're  gonna have to  get more beer  anyway  you're not just  gonna have two  beers  so it's just  keeping you from  getting and then  you'll have two  beers in the  fridge and go  now i have had  two beers and  now i gotta go  out  besides the  sickness and  the hangovers  is those moments  when you're drunk  and something's 
[01:15:00]  happening you're  like motherfucker  man i'm  fucking and  then you have  that moment  even in your  drunkenness where  you're like i'm  making a complete  asshole out of  myself  oh really  yeah there's  those weird  little even when  you're loaded  those fucking  moments of  humiliation  clarity  like we all  of a sudden  you clear up  and you're  like oh my  god i'm  humiliating  myself and  then you're  right back  into it  and then  that i don't  miss do you  remember people  looking at you  and and being  like oh my god  what's wrong  with him  cringy  and how much  did you need  to drink to  get to that  point i just  i was so broke  at that age 
[01:15:30]  literally we would  have eight dollars  between the three  of us and have  to just go in on  a case of warm  meister brown like  we had no money  nothing we'd have  to drink grain  alcohol because it  was you know if you  have five bucks  or whatever between  two guys you got to  alcohol because  that's whatever it  was it was all  about getting as  much so see your  your drinking was  purely to get  intoxicated yes  like there's i  understand i will  drink and and get  drunk believe me i  know that yeah it's  more of like but i 
[01:16:00]  kind of like like  if the beer isn't  cold i'm like ah  this sucks the beer  is not cold like  it's not just drink  get drunk i i'm  not trying to make  excuses here  excellent defense  against alcoholism  i prefer my beer  to be chilled  no i cannot win  here no because  the the it's like  it's like i  i have great  you find legitimate  reasons like that  you know i'm not  i'm not saying  anything but like  when you drink even  when you drink a lot  you go yeah but  there's times i just  like to have a beer  but it's like 
[01:16:30]  compulsive overeaters  can go there's times  where i have to eat  because i'm hungry  it's like all right  yeah but that still  doesn't mean that  you're not a big fat  fuck who eats too  much yeah just  because you happen to  have vegetables once  in a while well i  i guess so i don't  know it's like  grain alcohol i  would not drink  grain alcohol if  if all i had in my  house was grain  alcohol i wouldn't  drink it just so i  could go wow i need  to get drunk okay  like i i wouldn't do  that cool but but  you know i'll i'll  drink beer i'll drink  wine because just 
[01:17:00]  because i happen to  have enough resources  to get good stuff in  the house to drink  i guess i like the  fact that there's one  no that you check  would you drink  grain alcohol if  it was the only  thing some weird  you know thing that  might never occur  jimmy's jimmy's  just got like  anything i say  he's on it well  the funny because  it's funny to listen  to it's like you  know if there was a  gang raping your  mother would you  drink anyway no i'd  help her all right  well fair enough  then if that doesn't  happen though i'm  drinking i don't know 
[01:17:30]  i just worry about  my friends hitting a  pole that's what  that's what i worry  about with my  friends getting  killed drunk and  driving yeah i  understand that and  that's something i've  completely like cut  way fucking down on  like i i won't i  won't get to the  point where if i'm  over two beers i'm  not driving two  beers i'll go to the  store to get more  beer but but but i  won't uh i won't  drink and drive  anymore oh it's too  much it really is  now it's just crazy 
[01:18:00]  talk about lose  everything and then  have to deal with  your cut the  consequences of what  you did like  mentally dude 10  years in jail if you  kill somebody drunk  driving i know they  don't fucking play  games it's a mandatory  prison you're just  fucking like thinking  you're having a good  time and you're driving  and then and then  you're you're in  prison that's like  what what just  happened i was i was  having fun and now  i'm getting um a big  dick in my ass yeah  and having more fun  i'm like it's just a 
[01:18:30]  pisser but that's the  worst it's like when  you read these stories  the news or i see  the news about  like like there's  this these teenagers  standing at a bus  stop uh the other  night and this  korean girl was like  17 and some drunk  huh no way too old  for him and a pickup  truck this guy from  florida plowed through  them and pinned her  against the wall and  she's gonna live but  he like he fucking  broke her pelvis and  both her legs and he  broke his leg and  like he's going to  jail for years for  that yeah yeah and  it's like just to have  had that because you're  trying to make a u-turn  and you're fucked up  like yeah it's not  like you went out  going all right i'm 
[01:19:00]  gonna rob a bank yes  see if i can get  some money you're out  having fun which you  think is is a lot of  fun and then uh there  you go 10 years 10 years  in the jernt fuck man  you so don't want that  there's that uh psa now  with that mother and  uh father that were in  the limo with the  little daughter and uh  the guy was driving  the wrong way yes  yes on collision yeah  and then the the  mother's talking about  and her head was torn  from her body and she  actually sat there  on the side of the  road like holding her 
[01:19:30]  daughter's head and  stroking the hair of  the daughter's head  when the police came  up those cops have to  be just waking up  every night going  just nightmarish how  do you look at  something like that  it's horrible but  they're doing a psa  and the guy is like  you know so you know  would you want to  would you want to  kill my daughter  it's like a psa for  not drunk yeah yeah  it's kind of like well  yeah that would be  kind of bad  there was what were  the psa's they used  to do for drunk  driving they were 
[01:20:00]  really good they were  just silent and they  were fucking home  videos oh they would  have home videos you  wouldn't even know at  first you're watching  and going oh that's  kind of a cute little  home video look it's a  birthday party and then  they'd have the name of  the kid and how old he  was and that and then  it would be like killed  by a drunk driver and  the laugh track would  play I just said that  because I'm uncomfortable  I know those are  terrible it would remind  me to go to the fridge  and get another beer oh  those are fucking  horrendous commercials  sometimes things like  that would remind me to 
[01:20:30]  uh grab a beer like  psa's for drinking and  driving and I'd be  like oh there's beer in  the fridge and I'd go  get a beer or a  cigarette for smoking  too  smoking's another one  like they would show  smoking psa I smoked  for 27 years until I  was told I have  throat cancer you're  like oh fuck my  cigarettes are upstairs  let me go grab some  yeah  sometimes I don't think  they'd do what they  were supposed to do  a star wars psa for  what drunk driving I  don't remember drunk  drivers in uh in star 
[01:21:00]  wars oh your favorite  song too see they're at  the cantina drinking  oh great  see that ended with  Greedo getting shot  someone died  when friends drink too  much even in galaxies  far far away  friends don't let  friends drive drunk  oh did lucas make  money off of that  fuck please 
[01:21:30]  fat greedy bastard  they should show him  like creating Ewoks  and do that as a  fucking drunk driving  psa  he's all hammered  it's a great idea  little furry animals  and something that  people actually enjoyed  even adults  turned into a  childhood mess  is this a smoking psa  oh I love the c3po  smoking psa  it's only on one side  but 
[01:22:00]  oh is he smoking  is R2 smoking  R2 what are you  R2 you're on fire  R2 D2 you found a  cigarette  well I don't think  smoking is grown up  at all  because it's very  dangerous  smoking does dreadful  things to your lungs  and is very bad for  your heart  please  well I know I don't 
[01:22:30]  have one but humans  do and I think we  should set a good  example  oh  oh he threw it  away  oh hello  you know smoking  is bad for your  health  but it isn't grown  up at all  so please  don't smoke  makes you look  cool  exactly  everybody  how about Darth  Vader doing one  smoking is like  faggot  I have emphysema  as he's fucking a  jawa in the ass 
[01:23:00]  yeah  maybe chewbacca or  something  saying you can't  drive the millennium  falcon if you've been  smoking or something  I don't know  I don't know  Chip has a lot of  half-baked ideas  they're not quite  done  so he just goes  I don't know  they're like pies  that are no good  that's exactly  say bad  bacon  oh this one's my  favorite  one of my favorites  too  PSA  for pot  let's listen to it  hey Joey  it's a remix 
[01:23:30]  here take a look  through your marijuana  it's a  it's a remix  assholes  I hate when I go to  a video and  yeah it's just  it's a remix  of some shite  did you got the  real one  I want to see  the real one  I don't know why  I love like PSAs  look through these  stupid things  they're so hokey  I don't think  they ever work  some of them  are really bad  some of them 
[01:24:00]  are really well done  and some of them  are such fucking  cheese  the one with the guy  with the hole in his  throat I think  is good  they've gotten  with smoking PSAs  they thought like  you know  C-3PO telling kids  not to smoke  ain't gonna work  you show  an artery  that they're squeezing  out like toothpaste  with all kinds  of gack  or a cancerous  lung that they  took out  I think that  shit will work  also  the hole in his  throat  I used to go  swimming  and now I 
[01:24:30]  cannot do  anything that I  like it to do  and he's swabbing  out the blowhole  with a fucking  Q-tip  why can't he  swim though  because he's got  to breathe out of  the hole in his  neck  water will start  filling up his  lungs  it goes right  from his neck  into his lungs  with nary  an obstacle  but the thing  is  what was the  PSA in Canada  for the  safety at the  workplace PSAs  were great  they were really  funny  they were well  shot  that was the  one with the  girl falling  off the ladder  and crashing  to a glass  coffee table  holy mackerel 
[01:25:00]  was that  fucking great  she took out  Danny Thomas  exactly  Danny Thomas  the German lady  and her  were killed  and Chuck  Berry of course  also  God bless Chuck  and Jim Norton  who didn't  believe in  the table  bar  barrier  Marvin was  watching  a sous chef  here  she carries  the hot water  scalding water  because I'm  about to be  in a terrible 
[01:25:30]  accident  but really  I should have  cleaned up  the grease  over there  and they should  never put the  deep fryer  so close  she fell  backwards  I love it  hot grease  oh these  commercials  are awful  hot grease  was just  like  spilled on  her face  and neck  oh here's  the welder  there's a  black guy  welding  oh Jesus  I'm working  overtime  because I want  to take my  family on a  nice vacation  oh god  soon they get 
[01:26:00]  a call  telling them  I was killed  in an accident  but hey  I'm wearing  a busted  harness here  and the  company  shouldn't  check those  tanks  oh shit  he got  he got  blown off  he got  blown off  he got  blown off  the fucking  roof and  fell onto  a truck  I love how  it's not bad  enough that he  got blown up  he's got to  fall on a  truck  but it goes  even further  than that  because now  he does he  bounce off the  roof of the  truck but he  also hits the  hood of the  hood and then  falls on the  ground 
[01:26:30]  and he has a  bad harness too  so yeah  it's a busted  harness and the  propane  everything went  wrong  surprised the  building didn't  collapse on him  poor fuck  and they told me  that there was no  AIDS in this  orange juice  alright you got  it  we get the  point  you work in a  very dangerous  place  exactly what do  you do  I normally  carry AIDS  needles  they didn't  tell me that I  shouldn't put them  in my hands  like a pin  cushion  I juggle  them  alright this is  a factory  accident  they call the 
[01:27:00]  forklift operator  and there's no  protective thing  over the top  of the  forklift  oh wow  and he backs  into something  this was no  accident  the company  knows it's  against code  to store that  much weight  up there  I knew I  should have  been focused  on what I  was doing  and it's  obvious the  supervisor didn't  report that  broken shelf  he's impaled  with metal  fucking rods  he backed  into a  fucking  he backed  into like a  bunch of 
[01:27:30]  shelves and  these sharp  metal rods  fell on him  and when he  stood up  there was  two sticking  out one  like obviously  through his  heart  yeah  and you'd  never be that  calm if you  were dead  no  you'd be very  angry still  oh that was  hey jim  he's having a  casual conversation  what could happen  at a retail store  maybe you're  putting something  on a ladder  by yourself  yeah  oh oh  okay  and she leans  over  oh  that's a great  one  oh she fell  right through  that glass  accident 
[01:28:00]  it's just no  accident  her wrist is  broken  company should  have replaced  that ladder  years ago  yeah  I knew I  shouldn't have  reached over  like that  no  and why  isn't there  strict policy  about two  people doing  a job like  this  yeah  she's bleeding  she's obviously  dead right  I would guess  so yeah  but why would  she be so calm  as they say  call the ambulance  why do you  scold the company  first thing  oh this has  got to be  the electricity  accident  I didn't  see this one  I didn't see  James was with  our company  for 10 years  it's a eulogy  accident  he's getting 
[01:28:30]  out of the coffin  what are you  talking about  your company  never fully  trained me  to deal  with high  voltage wires  and the way  they were  insulated  he's electrocuted  it's obvious  someone wanted  to get home  in a hurry  what was I  thinking  you're scaring  your family  I'm wearing  all of my  safety equipment  he's up out  of the coffin  he's up out  of the coffin  all burnt up  from an electrical  fucking accident  the black tips  of his fingers  are pure black  and his face  was like  half burned off  and he sat 
[01:29:00]  up in the coffin  and the family  is not going  why are you  sitting up  you're dead  they're actually  wondering  could you  further explain  the company's  errors  if a guy  sat up  in a wake  I wouldn't  listen to  the content  of what he  was saying  no  running out  of the  and of course  our favorite  oh this is  the domestic  domestic violence  the bitch  spills his coffee  she spilled  my coffee  I'm sorry  sir  you fucking  bitch  pins her down 
[01:29:30]  and pours hot  coffee  yeah exactly  how do you like  this  smacks her  you wouldn't  get away  with it here  but do it at home  you shouldn't get away  with it at home  I like the fact  that the kids  already know  what's coming  yeah  they've seen  this before  we've talked  about this  a thousand times  it's simply  it's up there  with Citizen Kane  as far as  great things  that were filmed  it's just  old hat  for the kids  it really is  they're sitting there  like oh dad's  at it again  pouring hot coffee  on a chick's tits  if you watch it  as soon as the coffee  goes in the saucer 
[01:30:00]  the kids look down  like oh boy  oh boy  someone's getting  scalding coffee  on her chest  yeah let me  the kids  she spills it  and watch the kids  all over the saucer  he examines it  she spilled my coffee  and the daughter  the daughter's  coloring or something  and she turns  her head  she puts her head  in her hand  like oh no  oh no  you didn't do that  you didn't do  you fucking bitch  she spilled my coffee 
[01:30:30]  it's my favorite part  this moment of reflection  everybody's just watching  the clumsy waitress  get her comeuppance  she'll get no gratuity  either  you wouldn't get away  with it at home  you wouldn't get away  with it here  don't spill coffee  it's a don't spill  the customer coffee  PSA  it's a PSA  for being a better  waitress  it's a restaurant  training video  this is the office  yes  Ron I think it's 19  no the new numbers 
[01:31:00]  are right  it is 23%  you stupid bitch  don't you ever  do it  he's smashing your face  into the table  conference table  she's bleeding  no  he throws the  fucking shit  out of her  and then he fixes  his tie  like I'm sorry  that happened  back to business  without that  uppity hole  again  that's a PSA  for doing good math  don't correct somebody  until you know  your math is right 
[01:31:30]  fucking love it  those are all  Canadian right  there's something  going on in Canada  that is just  yes great comedy  Canada is so  similar to  our wonderful  great country  but they do have  these little quirks  really odd  they got these  like almost  Canadian pride  kind of PSAs  where they talk  about Canadian  history and how  great it is  and one has  this American guy  it's like in the  old west I think 
[01:32:00]  or something  or oldie days  and this American  is up there  and he's just  being the most  obnoxious prick  ever and the  Canadians are like  hey mellow out  everything's cool  why don't you go  back to your  United States  there's an  inferiority complex  going on up there  of course there is  and there should be  crazy Canadians  but I'll tell you  one thing about  Canada that's great  because Craigslist  got so gutted here  they took the  erotic section down  you know just  more moral policing  and they have  their erotic section  in Canada  they're not as  uptight about sex 
[01:32:30]  they don't like  the racism up there  they're horrible  they suck  but I mean  for the sex  at least they're not  sex they're not  that bad  yeah  it's weird  it's like  we want prostitution  off the street  it's off the street  and now we're  saying get it out of  you  it's like  mind boggling  how we mind  each other's  fucking business  yeah that whole  thing with Craigslist  is really weird  some fucking  Canadian  pussy boy  prosecutor  that's who it was  who started  all these lawsuits  and stuff  it might have been  a sheriff that  sued first  but this Canadian  I'm sorry  Connecticut  prosecutor  really pushed it  after Philip Markoff 
[01:33:00]  killed that chicken  like that  happens with anything  of course it does  over the phone  of course it does  you know  just because  and they got rid of  did they get rid of  all of their erotic  yes the adult section  and the adults  and erotic  Jimmy will tell you  exactly what they got rid of  no I know  it was a huge story though  because to me  it really is  and I think  the bottom line  is they were being sued  and of course  you could sue people  however you want  so they didn't  want to deal  with legal bills  yeah  because I think  a judge found  that you cannot 
[01:33:30]  be responsible  for the content  that goes up  erotic services  where is that  Montreal or Toronto  or something  yeah there you go  yeah it's on  craigslist.ca  oh okay  .ca  hell is that  they're right though  they're completely right  calm  have a calm  oh jeez  I'll bring Adam in  why don't we  you want to take  a break  yeah I wouldn't mind  taking a leak  let's take a break  ski  hi Adam  and then we'll say  hi to my pal  Adam Ferrara  big TV star  so we'll be out  right back  Donnie Fontaine  doesn't get that picture

[01:35:00]  allegedly there's a  car there's a special  on the History Channel  with Opie and Anthony  and little Jimmy Norton  that's right  December 29th  December 29th  yeah  Mr. Norton  I wanna see you  in my chambers  I wanna speak to you  marine to marine  who was that guy  during the OJ trial  was that uh  Bailey was yelling  at Furman  F. Lee Bailey  marine to marine  answer me  stop  yeah like  marines never  use that language  who said that  Bailey  F. Lee Bailey  said it to Mark  Furman  what'd Furman say  Furman said  he called him  marine to marine  he called him  a nip  yo drunk 
[01:35:30]  I didn't do it  yeah Adams  because I watch  the History Channel  a lot  I like it  they've revamped  the History Channel  now let me tell you  something  I watched it  for many many years  just because  of the giant H  which at the time  stood for Hitler  yep  I know it wasn't  history  and I would watch it  because it was  constant goose stepping  sure  we would sit around  the apartment going  come on  it's the battle  of the bulge  there he goes  you got some 
[01:36:00]  good celebrities  Hitler's blitzkrieg  in his way  across Europe again  let's see how it  turns out this time  and now they've  gotten a lot more  original programming  yeah  they're doing a good job  yeah Buzz Aldrin  sorry yeah  Buzz Aldrin  he was our first guest  to fly a spaceship  what happens  he comes down  he was our first guest  and he was our big star  in a small car  so the show is  they do a lap  around our car  in our little car  which is a Suzuki SX4  because there's a lot  of money on basic cable  so he does that  and then we  and then we just 
[01:36:30]  interview  and we show him  the lap  and he was great  he was telling a story  I mean how many times  has he told about  yes I went to the moon  yeah  so like in really saying  it was basically a can  the three of them  in a can  and it took him  two days  to get to the moon  and I said Buzz  at any point  did you just lean over  and go  Neil  Neil  shut the fuck up  you're driving me  freaking crazy  it's true  if you're just a couple  of days with your friends  like shut up  but if you think about  landing on the moon  like they get there  like we're the first  human beings ever  to be on the moon  and Buzz is like  Neil you go first 
[01:37:00]  you see what the fuck  is out there  I got the flag  I'm right behind you  every photo  on the moon  is a Buzz Aldrin  except I think one  they're all photos  of Buzz  they're not photos  of Neil Armstrong  Neil was taking the photos  that's the hard part  you can never be in them  and Michael Collins  he's the guy  who stayed in the capital  he's the close  but no cigar guy  fun fact about Michael Collins  at one point  fun fact  I can't say how many times  I've gotten blown  after this one  when he was circling  behind the moon  he was the most isolated  human being in history 
[01:37:30]  oh  because he was the farthest  from other human beings  that a human being  has ever been  and he couldn't communicate  could not communicate  and no one has ever been  that far from other people  how long was he by himself  I want to say a half hour  an hour  maybe we could look that up  that's my dream though  that's our dream too  that is my  you on the far side  of the moon  yes you  up in the clouds  five  four  three  won't be long now  two  one  I would love a nice  loss of signal  oh well  I have AT&T 
[01:38:00]  I get it  won't be long now  was that Major Tommy  he's like  what happened Major Tom  in the song  he goes up  and he's joking  like yeah I'll have a drink  and then just joking  but then there's a problem  what's the problem  what  is that what happens  ground control  he's like having a drink  he makes a joke  about get me a drink  and then something goes wrong  in his ship  and he's probably  lost in space  and the next word  is tell my wife  I love her  and that's it  I'm gonna die  yeah  I never really paid  much attention 
[01:38:30]  to the words  your mother's content  Major Tom  that's it  auto  auto  look at that  it's serious moonlight  I was  talking about the show now  yeah  the Top Gear  Top Gear  I've watched  a lot of the commercials  for it  on History  and I see my pal there  and one thing  I've noticed  about Adam  over the years  not very good  with cars  not very good  fix  no  I'm very stunned  that you are doing this  because through all the years 
[01:39:00]  as far as  knowing about  fixing cars  driving  but not  getting lost  well yeah  that was  you're  you're not  the go to guy  well mechanically  look we know  I can't fix them  no we know that  we know that  but when I was little  working with Pop  my job was to  hold the light  and that's when I was  peaking  right there  hold the light  hold the light  what do you do  you're blocking my light  get out of here  remember we tried to  fix the brakes  the drum brakes  on the Dodge  what a disaster  I took off the drum brakes  I put it on my father's 
[01:39:30]  new chamois  and he said  alright that's it  you're done  that's not a rag  you used the chamois  as a grease rag  and Pop got really mad  so I can't fix them  but they're fun driving them  and I really don't have  a good sense of direction  yeah yeah  but now with GPS  you don't need that  see  how was Buzz  did he treat you well  Buzz was sweet  Buzz was great  he's a tough interview though  we had him  we had him  and he winds up  he kind of goes  into a weird zone  because again  what are we going to say  that interests him  he's on the moon  he's a bit of a prick  I'm saying that  not Adam  I like the fact 
[01:40:00]  that he is  I like the fact  that he popped  that reporter  in the face  for saying  me too  that they never  landed on the moon  I like the fact  that I tried to get  a picture of me  and him  signed  and he's like  I don't want to sign  anything  and then he was  talking to my  chick  and she comes over  and goes  I can get your picture  signed  I'm like  why don't you  just give it to me  because I think  he wanted to  bang my chick  of course he did  that's me speculating  and then she walked over  and he realized  it was a picture of me  and him  that he had refused  to sign  and he's like  I'll do it a little later  and his wife's like  just sign it Buzz 
[01:40:30]  oh really  his wife said  yeah she was so annoyed  oh he's gotta take shit  he was on the moon  and then he signed it  and then people  started coming over  and getting cell phone pictures  so I really did ruin his night  fucked it all up for him  good  I tried talking to him  after he wanted  nothing to do with me  prick  that's great  but you gotta figure  I asked him  I said you know  you spoke to  you spoke to the earth  from the moon  in 1969  does it really piss you off  now when you can't  get a fucking cell signal  yeah  and he just laughs  and he's like  cell what's that  I have no clue 
[01:41:00]  I'm old  but he was great  yeah  he was good  you know who was really good  was Michelle Rodriguez  from the Fast and the Furious  in Avatar  she was cool  and lost  Tim Allen was cool  Kid Rock  Bret Michaels  look at this  star studded  star studded  yes  how do you  enough of you  getting people  we can't get  yeah I know right  well they let them drive  that's nice  let them drive  some cool  but they drive  the Suzuki  the SX4  they don't drive  the supercars  what's the fastest  one of those 
[01:41:30]  celebrities  we've gotten  we don't have  a mile for  I think next season  if we get picked up  we're going to have  like a speedometer  and a taxi  you can see  what's going on  yeah you should  kind of have  something like that  see who could  go fastest  wait what do they do  they just drive  in a circle  no it's a track  it's a whole  like there's teardrops  and there's a long  back stretch  and there's a whole  lap  and you do a lap  hairpin turns  hairpin turns  we got  and then we keep  the celebrity times  and we put them up  on the board  and they compete  against each other  now because it's  on the history channel  my first guest  I wanted to have  was Hitler  how funny would that be 
[01:42:00]  I'm in the middle  of an interview  and the celebrities  do their time  and I just lean over  going so  do you think  you were faster  than Hitler  and you just  write down the times  I don't think  they found the humor  in it  Mel Gibson would get  a big laugh  out of it  Harvey Weinstein  not so much  the letters  are pouring in  so yeah  so that  it airs  Sunday  the 21st  at 10 o'clock  and I guess  Jimmy  what did you just do  just laughing  about the whole thing  yes  and I'm  I'm just laughing  at my awful reference  to Harvey Weinstein  like I couldn't find  a more fucking  topical hip Jewish guy 
[01:42:30]  the fucking  no showbiz faggot  we all understood  he's Jewish  sure  Weinstein  how could you go wrong  it's all we needed  terrible  you could have said  the wedding ring guy  wait Harvey  who's the one  who's on Broadway  Harvey Feierstein  Feierstein  that's what I meant  not Weinstein  I meant Harvey Feierstein  it still works  no but Harvey Weinstein  is a producer  yeah  but he's Jewish  I didn't mean him  wasn't that the point  I know but I meant  they wouldn't have  Harvey Weinstein  no they probably 
[01:43:00]  Harvey Feierstein  I don't think  they'd even have  Harvey Feierstein  they wouldn't  you know the nice thing  is you can never  be anti-Semitic  because you can't  pick them out  so that's what  you can't be  you love all people  look at you  it's all Hollywood now  love all people  yeah I'm all Hollywood  my ass  my ass  and then what  are you  what was that  comics come home  that was great  I got to see  and thank you again  I'm going to tell  people on the  you're welcome  he took a  oh Jimmy  he took a red eye  he did the  tonight show  took a red eye

[01:44:30]  and healthy eating  he's done it before  then he puts it back on  but now this is the thinnest  I think I got a picture  this is the thinnest he's ever been  dude his stomach  when he tightened his stomach up  yeah he's thinner than that  he's thinner than that  oh yeah  his stomach was fucking tight  dude  it was tight  yeah he took me  poking his stomach  on his ass  not so much  not so much  which would indicate  why he lost the weight  but he was eager  eager and greedy  oh yeah  pictures of us on stage  all of us throwing out  the balloons and stuff  yeah I got that's the  throwing out the balloons 
[01:45:00]  I mean the shirts  oh  how do you mix up shirts  and balloons  because I'm dumb  that's why  I'm only half paying attention  he really  he looks really good  oh my god  yeah  what did he color his hair  and everything  yeah  he looks like Robert Blake  what the fuck is he doing  yes  wow  that was great  young Lenny  Stephen Wright was very nice  yeah  we chatted a little bit  about  you did  yeah yeah  he was very cool  he's not big on shaking hands  though he does the fist bump  but  does he  yeah you know  that going in  you know  but that is kind of  like you see his persona 
[01:45:30]  on stage  you never really see  interviews with him  when he's not like that  yeah  is he laid back  he's very mellow  like  because he said  I guess he had seen  a segment I did on Leno  and he's like  so is Jay's taking care of you  and I'm like  yeah  and I'm talking  and then he's just like  oh that's cool  like he's a very quiet dude  so you  yeah that is just him  yeah  he's like that  you know when you do  a satellite interview  and there's that half a beat  that delay  yeah  that's pretty much it  yeah he's a phoner  in person 
[01:46:00]  but you know  he was nice  yeah he was really cool  he's funny too man  he had  oh he had one brilliant  fucking joke  about an EKG  or something  god he's  yeah  he still writes stuff  and you're like  fuck he's good man  he writes some funny shit  yeah  and he was really cool  when I first started  I was doing kind of  a couple years  and I opened from  Manhattan College  and you know  when you open for those  big names  you go up  you do your  when we start  you do your 10 minutes  and you go on  you do your stuff  you get booed  and I got  and stay out  so I got summoned  to the castle  you know Stephen  like he was in the back 
[01:46:30]  of the room  playing his guitar  and he told me  I was funny  and I was messing around  and playing the guitar  he just took a couple minutes  to talk to me  so I said Stephen  you did a very kind thing  for me when I started out  I told him the whole story  no recollection  no  he probably does that  to everybody  he's probably gay  and wanted to have sex  with you  you weren't putting out  young Adam  I wanted to put it  in your Tony Danza  looking body  wanted to get some  of that karate kid magic  give me some of the  Ralph Macchio  I just met him

[01:49:00]  the other day  finishing an interview  you weren't trying  yes  I need a cap  on my chimney  and I don't have time  call the guy  I'm going to call the guy  but in the meantime  it's raining  so I have this  this big tarp  and this come along  and this rope  and I'm on a ladder  and I'm trying to  just put a tarp  over my chimney  and secure it  until the guy  can come  yeah there's so many  things working against me  my mechanical ability  gravity  better judgment  the way you walk  the way I walk  I mean there's just 
[01:49:30]  too many friggin things  working against me  do you mean your  Laurel and Hardy gate  doesn't do well  on a roof  oh what a dick  is that funny  my Laurel and Hardy gate  if I didn't have  a short leg  I'd kick you  right in the air  do you have a short leg  what  do you have a short leg  my hip is  my hip is deformed  like years ago  I didn't know that  when he was a kid  when he was a little kid  they had to do something  to his growth plate  oh poor little guy  they took my knee out  yeah 1960s 
[01:50:00]  Frankenstein surgery  they had to take out  his growth plate  poor little doll  he used to make fun  of his growth plate  yeah they took it  out of my knee  it's where your leg  grows from  so they figure  this kid's one  growth plate ain't working  the other one's working  so they gotta remove  the growth plate  or else his one leg  would have kept growing  yeah I would have been  like you know  Esmeralda thinks I'm cute  so they took it out  poor boy has an  overactive  pituitary gland  his pituitary gland  is overactive  it's got nothing to do  with the pituitary gland 
[01:50:30]  it's a growth plate  under the knee  I've never heard of that  I've never heard of that  I never did either  until I took it out  and the funniest thing  is I get out of the  whole thing  and then we start  hanging out at the  end of high school  and these idiots  find out about it  relentless for two years  yeah we wouldn't stop  of course  you hungry here  let me serve it to you  on your growth plate  shut the fuck up  it wouldn't stop  everybody had their  cross to bear  yes  oh we were  we were ruthless  on each other  poor bison  we hung out with a guy  named you know  bison  because of the head  and his head  you ever see a bison's head 
[01:51:00]  yes  like from the eyes  to that little tuft of hair  they have on the top  of their head  it's just a giant forehead  on a buffalo  he had that  he had a giant  flat forehead  and it just opened him up  to be sitting on the couch  watching television  and then Adam would just go  tag  and smack him  in the forehead  as hard as he could  where he'd just have  a hand print  on this giant  bison like forehead  I think there was like 
[01:51:30]  a callus on his head  because he would just go  I mean I would just  wail on him  and he would just laugh  his foot would do it too  he had a little ponytail  and his profile  looked like he was  on the quarter  it was just this big  at one time  Joe Curry smacked him  in the head  and said tag  and he got all mad  and he goes  I'm gonna count to three  and you better be out of here  and Joe's like  I'm not worried  you can't count to three  bison used to catch  a lot of shit  for being a little  stupid  was he dumb  he wasn't dumb 
[01:52:00]  he wasn't the smartest guy  out of everybody  we hung out with  you know like  when you wait for  Stephen Wright  to say something  and it's genius  you wait for bison  to say something  and it's not  and it wasn't  so we'd sit there  I remember looking over  every so often  during NASCAR racing  that was on constantly  and he'd just have this  smile on his face  like a morphine drip  like pure  bliss  is he a big cock  I bet bison had a big cock  I don't know  I never saw the bison's cock  what is he doing now  I don't know 
[01:52:30]  I don't know  I think he lives in Virginia  I think he got married  he moved down to Virginia  and he's on a horse farm  yeah  coincidentally enough  maybe he's raising the bison  I have no idea  yeah  he was  I remember when the landlord  came up  we would hide in the wall  yeah yeah  we had to hide  because we didn't pay the rent  because we bought  radio control helicopters  and slot cars  who are you guys  fucking from that  Wes Craven movie  are you the people  under the stairs  we were the people  behind the sheet rock  it was really  it was very  difficult to 
[01:53:00]  get paid  and not just  want to spend  the money  like the white  trash piece  of shit  I was  and actually  save money  and put it away  for rent  it just never  happened  I just assumed  at some point  I'd get money  before the end  of the month  and be able  to pay the rent  that rarely happened  also look at  the apartment  and what it was  I mean  who's knocking  down the door  to live there  yeah it was  a real  fucking  shack  it was a honeycomb  hideout  pretty much  yeah Pee Wee's  Playhouse  covered with toys  couldn't pay the rent 
[01:53:30]  and anybody  could just walk in  grab beer  and him  like you know  you leave something  I left my Nell spot  007  my gun  at the house  for paintball gun  I come back  a week later  I forget where I was  I come back  a week later  he's taken it apart  and made a grenade  launcher at him  I go where's my gun  he goes well here's  part of it  here's the other part  look what I can do  yeah you could never  leave shit over my house  I would absolutely  take it apart  and try to make  something else  he's like Jeffrey Dahmer  you leave your cousin  over there  and he tries to make  a sex zombie  I drilled a hole 
[01:54:00]  in his head  I wanted them alive  but I didn't want  them to leave  what a sweetheart  did you see the interview  on MSNBC  with him and the father  he was sitting there  with his father  in prison  and his father  was trying to make  sense of the whole thing  that's a proud moment  yeah  why as a father  would you even  entertain the idea  of looking at him  at what point  does the father  look like  maybe I did something  maybe I should have  disciplined him  a little more  you could say  unconditional love  or you could say  there's one  conditional love 
[01:54:30]  or you could say  there's one condition  if you're drilling  holes in Asian  gentlemen's heads  and having sex  with them  don't eat him  okay  that's all  if he didn't eat him  for God's sake  I just loved him  it was very important  for people to know  that he was not  a pedophile too  oh was it  that would have  made him weird  that was a big thing  for him though  because one of the  victims was 14  but Dahmer thought  he was older  the one who didn't  speak Loatian  or Laotian  we could all relate  to one thing  the kid runs out  and he didn't speak  English very well  he got away didn't he  yes but he went to  the police 
[01:55:00]  and the police  gave him back  to Dahmer  they brought him back  they thought it was  a lover's quarrel  a naked 14 Laotian  they didn't know  he was 14  and then he murdered  him when he went  upstairs  and he was so  fucked up  from like  he had drilled  a hole in his head  already  and put some kind  of Drano and shit  in there  so when the kid  broke out of the house  he got out of the house  and the cops got him  he was really  fucked up  and they thought  he was intoxicated  and Dahmer came out  and he was like  yeah he's  you know  been drinking  and stuff  I'll take care of him 
[01:55:30]  and they're like  okay  and the cops are like  hey a couple of homos  we'll just give them back  isn't that amazing  and it's like  the guy looks like  oh my god  I made it  I'm free  and they give you back  to the guy  that's gonna eat you  and he killed him  immediately I think upstairs  oh yeah you gotta  you gotta  can't take the chance  he's gonna get out again  come here you rascal  yeah you  you're a sly one  why was he pouring  Drano in his head  he was trying to make  sex zombies  he was trying to make  them compliant 
[01:56:00]  and complacent  to his whim  yeah he didn't want  them to leave him  yeah so he figured  if he fucking drilled  holes in their heads  and burnt out  pieces of their brain  with Drano  yeah the  I gotta get the fuck  out of here  part of their brain  they'd become  where's the  I wanna get the fuck  out of here  part of your brain  how do you not  think that's gonna  cause an infection  yeah you know  it might work  for a second  but then he's gonna  go like ow  I think I'm dying  but he had  but he was saving  the parts and stuff  wasn't he  yeah skulls  he had a lot 
[01:56:30]  of that shit  when he killed  the people  he'd cut them up  and then again  sometimes eat them  cook them  and eat them  what is that all about  he's hungry  he's probably  just chronically cheap  that's what Sam  would do  if he was a serial killer  meat cost in a store  this skull's gonna get  freezer burned  I have to double wrap it  and he worked  in a chocolate factory  in Milwaukee  yeah he worked  for a candy factory  I went to  Cleveland  Ohio  Akron  wherever the fuck  I was  and apparently 
[01:57:00]  his childhood home  is there  really  and I took  a drive past there  and kind of  kind of creepy  because you know  it was probably  the place he  killed that first  little fucking puppy  or something  and chopped it up  and buried it  and the parents  were blind  to the whole thing  yeah I mean  when people go past  the apartment  where you started  they go  this is where  he hid in the wall  yeah  this is where  he couldn't pay  his rent  this is where  he climbed up  the pole  with Radio Shack  wiring  and ran  800 feet  of cable  this is where 
[01:57:30]  they barbecued  in the backyard  with vice grips  pools  yeah it was always  good to come back  from the paintball games  and we each grabbed  like a full London broil  yep  and barbecued  with tools  that's what we had  here's the wrench  yeah  you don't turn a steak  with a wrench  what's wrong with you  use these channel locks  what the fuck  was going on  remember the buggy  you built  out of the Volkswagen  yeah I always had  one of those  Baja bugs  and then the brakes  went out  when I had Jim Laird  in there  and it crashed  right through the fence  I made it all the way home 
[01:58:00]  thank god  and then I went  and stepped on the brakes  where I usually  park in front of the fence  and the brakes  hit the floor  and the thing  just smashed  right through the fence  Laird just turned to me  and looks  and goes  you park like that  every day  no  Laird  who drives like  Ted Kennedy  he's fucking  telling people  what to do  shoot the hostage  shoot the hostage  is that the guy  that would tell tall tales  yeah a few tall tales  Amanda McLaird  yeah  yeah  he was on our  paintball team  thank you very much  oh good

[02:07:00]  we're gonna do that  big party  big party  down there  I didn't dress for a party  don't say nothing about you  it don't say nothing about you  remember that  in that cowboy  I just recently saw that again  um because I don't think  I'd seen it since I  was a kid and didn't  understand it  yeah  what a tragic fucking movie  that is  oh it's fucking great  it's just depressing  yeah it's just like  it was  I just like to see  Dustin Hoffman go  we're walking here  oh  and that was  that was the scary 
[02:07:30]  Manhattan  that I was frightened  as  as a kid  cause we were bridging  tunnel trash  so the city was  like I was so young  at that time too  that uh  I was petrified  to go in the city  with anybody  um that wasn't  my mommy  like  like if  and that's why  during field trips  that were gonna be  in the city  like oh we're all  going to the museum  of natural history  uh and they'd load  the kids up  from some shit  Long Island school  and bus them  into Manhattan  and we'd go to  the museum  of natural history  I wouldn't want  my mommy 
[02:08:00]  to be a field trip  mother  yeah  like they had  you know  I guess  four or five  chaperones  with the mother  of some of the kids  I would insist  and I'd just be like  please  you gotta get  because the thought  of going into the city  without my mommy  made me scared  yeah but you were what  23, 24  yeah I know  yeah but you're  see but  your brain  your brain is tough  to fucking figure out  I remember  the story  when you were little  and you didn't want  to get on the plane  because you thought  the rivets were too small  Joe says that  I was joking 
[02:08:30]  okay  that was a complete  I would please  I've admitted worse  on this show  uh no I was joking  of course the rivets  weren't too small  I believed in  aircraft builders  shows humor  at a young age  I'm sorry  keeping the dossier  no it was just  I was such a  like a little  fag  I just needed  mommy there  in the city  because the city  was the scariest  place on earth  to me  the scariest place  your parents  instilled that  in you coming  from Long Island  oh you don't go  to the city  there's monsters  in the city  and it was just 
[02:09:00]  like I don't know  if now  I was that age  and I saw  video of the city  the way it is now  like Times Square  and everything  it wouldn't be as scary  but there was something  about that grainy  gritty  fucking old buses  that would just  blast black smoke  in the air  and a lot of weird  fucking creep people  prostitutes everywhere  it was easy to get lost  little Anthony  to get swallowed up  by the big city  that's what it was  I was petrified 
[02:09:30]  of getting lost  in the city  I would have just  at fucking  8 years old  I'd have had a heart attack  from being so scared  and I'm sure you  at that age  instinctively understood  that you were a 10  on the rape scale  as a small boy  little Anthony  believe me  you were the fucking  holy grail  of molestability  I should have went down  to the bus station  I'd be lost  walking around  I don't know  where I am  I've lost my mommy  we have a winner  that's it  I'd have a cock 
[02:10:00]  in my mouth  in a second  you'd be able  to take applications  as to who was  going to molest you  can you show me  how to get home  Mr. Dahmer  you were very  molestable  Jimmy  oh was I rapable  you had a very  molestable little  look to yourself  it's almost like  there's something  wrong with you  if you didn't  force feed me  cock at that age  oh my god  I think out of the  three of us  I'm the one  because I got  the bad legs  so I'm in the  back of the herd  so I'm the first  to be taken there  all we had to be  was faster than Adam  that's right  that was you  right there  that was the man 
[02:10:30]  helping you home  Richard Simmons  wow  his hair  look at that  looks like he  he gets  it looks like  that green stuff  you put in the  Easter basket  you know  the little  like fake grass  fake grass  what the fuck  wow  it's  yeah  he has like  chemo cream rinse  he has horrible  plugs  oh my god  are they  are they plugs  it looks like  it  those are  unplugs  they're coming  out  because he  always had  some kind  of coma  but it's like 
[02:11:00]  now it's just  so thin  and wispy  on top  by the way  that midnight  cowboy moment  was not supposed  to happen  that cab moment  was just one  where a cab  just rode through  while they were  trying to shoot  really  and hopped  and just  fucking  stop the street  didn't put  anybody back  no I guess  I guess they had  a PA or something  but the cab  he went around  them and that's  why he just  kept it in the movie  I like that  you mean a New York  cabbie didn't pay  attention to the rules  we're making a picture  here  especially back then  it was probably  some just old  gruff white guy  with a cigar  in his mouth  chewing on it  no protective 
[02:11:30]  barriers  they don't pay  me to chase  them  do you like  the scene  where Voyage  getting blown  in the movie  theater by the  nerd with the  glasses  oh god  and the guy  doesn't have  any money  are you gonna  beat me up  doesn't have  any money  yeah  and then the  old broad  he was banging  the old broad  Sylvia Miles  she got all  pissed up  that was Sylvia  Miles  I think so  didn't we talk  to her  oh wait  was it Sylvia  Miles  there was  another one  I think  Sylvia Miles  we need that  information 
[02:12:00]  he's not here  but Harry Potter's  cock all day  yeah all day long  yeah who was it  Sylvia Miles  was in it  but was she  the young one  or the old  you were gonna  ask me for  money  yeah for money  she was very  upset  she's talking  to Maury  her boyfriend  on the phone  while the dog  yeps  and he takes  his cowboy clothes  off to fuck her  that's Sylvia Miles  right  that's the old  lady  oh wow  damn  yeah she called  our show once  when we were  doing uh  who's the most  famous person  listening to the  show  we used to do 
[02:12:30]  that gag  and uh  she called  in once  it's like  oh yeah  I listen  I'm Sylvia Miles  we're like  holy shit  wait a minute  really  and it was  it turned out  to be her  it was a choice  between her  because you know  obviously she was  a star back then  but now  and it was the  guy that says  don't shoot  in the driveway  of Goodfellas  oh the guy  when we hit him  with the gun  yeah but it  wasn't the guy  that he hit  with the gun  it was his  friend  that went  don't shoot  he called  the show  and we were  like we were  fascinated with  him  oh you were  a Goodfellas  what was it like  if only Meadowlock 
[02:13:00]  Lemon could have  got to the phone  I know  we were thrilled  I sat next to  Meadow Soprano  at a sushi place  did you  I was eating sushi  in LA  and she came in  and sat down  next to me  and uh  Jonathan  my manager  like kind of  made me look over  so I'm like  I didn't know  who was her  oh she smelled  great too  so I'm like  looking  who is this guy  and then he  just texted me  Jamie Lynn  Siegler  dope  oh  was she with  somebody  yeah  a friend  I guess  oh yeah  guy  yeah  is she married  I don't know 
[02:13:30]  wasn't it  she was married  to the manager  for a while  it wasn't a  it didn't seem  like a date vibe  honestly  it just seemed  like just people  eating fish  which you know  that's what me  and my manager  were doing  we had her  on the show  at NEW  and she cried  that's why  I didn't mention  where I was from  yeah yeah  she started crying  why'd she cry  somebody may have  called up  and brought up  eating disorders  and things  and this was  during the time  when I mean  she was  she was a kid  at the time  and you know  people were talking  about how between  one of the seasons  and the next season  she'd kind of 
[02:14:00]  put on some weight  and of course  our very very  sympathetic audience  instead of putting  it in a way  that was nice  let's get her  it's like  hey  you got fat  or something  and she started  talking about  like eating  and an eating  disorder  or something  and then you  just saw her  her eyes  were starting  to well up  and her voice  got shaky  and we were  just like  I was like  crying girl  did she like 
[02:14:30]  you guys though  yeah she seemed  to  but like  crying chicks  you don't know  what to do  unless  fight the heart  on  unless I  fucking  hate them  and there's  only been a  couple  in my life  and by couple  I literally  mean probably  two  I think I know  both of them  to the point  where if they  were crying  because they  were crushed  by a truck  it wouldn't  faze me in the  least  but other girls  like when they 
[02:15:00]  start crying  it's like  that is the  kryptonite  yeah  it's Bugs Bunny  in an argument  in an argument  in some kind  of a thing  where like  they're talking  about problems  or baggage  or whatever  the fuck  it is  and they  start crying  it's like  you know  what it is  I feel that  and then I  get angry  I'm like  oh no  fuck  you can't  cry  but you  can't be  mad  because then  you can't  get mad  so now  you gotta  get a 
[02:15:30]  completely  new  offensive  root  because it  was like  great  I'm winning  this fucking  argument  or this  discussion  whatever the  fuck it is  I'm winning  I got you  dead  you're crying  fuck  now what  I can't  keep on  the same  thing I was  doing  because that's  what she's  crying about  I could be  like oh  I'm sorry  or she's  crying because  she knows  she's losing  I'm sorry  that's right  Adam takes  the harsh  root  cry  whore  you know  you're losing  that's it  you're gonna  squirt  you start

[02:18:00]  in California  when my  best friend  turned homo  and tried to  have oral  sex with me  and then  my New York  years  with the  bison  and foot  and Adam  you were the  New York  years  you weren't  there during  those California  during your  wild days  the wild  crazy days  the wild west  again  I think  that was  I think  that was  the point  where I  stopped  all my  faggy  crying  because  dad  would  you know  backhand  me 
[02:18:30]  he'd give  me a good  knock it  off  I don't  want to  see that  I was  sitting on  bleachers  once  watching  some kind  of  drunks  do something  in a  fucking  arena  with horses  and  I got  a cramp  in the  back of  my leg  in the  back of  my thigh  and  it  really  hurt  and  I  I  think  I  let  out  a  scream  like  I  was  being  dismembered  alive  and  my  father  just  turns  and  goes  what  the  fuck  are  you  doing  he  goes  I  don't  wait  if  you  got  an  arrow 
[02:19:00]  sticking  out  of  your  chest  I  don't  want  to  hear  you  make  that  sound  whap  boom  then I  got to  suck  it  up  couldn't  cry  wasn't  allowed  to  cry  how  old  I  have to  fill  in my  timeline  there's  a few  blank  spots  there  I  went to  California  at 12  but  all before  that  from 0  to 12  I was  cry  baby  and  then  from 12 
[02:19:30]  till  I  came  back  here  at  about  16  back  to  New  York  that  was  the  stop  crying  portion  and  then  after  16  it  was  just  you  know  whatever  I  know  when  you  had  enough  you  had  enough  that's  called  anger  I've  never  seen  Anthony  say  I've  had  enough  not  that  way  I've  had  enough  a  bartender  has  never  heard  that  if  you  said  no  thank  you  I  think  your  mustache  would  just  fall  off  I  don't  know  why  that  would 
[02:20:00]  happen  but  it's  a sign  of  the  body  not  knowing  what  to  do  it  pushes  the  mustache  I've  seen  him  had  enough  a  couple  of  times  I  remember  driving  home  once  with  room  in the  car  for  me  you  and  the  hangovers  we had  coming home  from  Poughkeepsie  oh god  those gigs  when you  stabbed  yeah  those gigs  we had  I had a  fight  with a  payphone  yeah  it was  a good  idea  he stabbed  himself  with a  payphone  and that  was the  worst  hangover  of my  life  well  I think  you were  feeling a  little  worse  about that  because  you were  trying to  sneak  a fat  brought 
[02:20:30]  out  of the  house  well  there  was  that  too  that's  a  great  idea  it's  one  day  because  he's  going to  school  up there  it's  one  day  that  we're  all  up  there  we had  a  gig  and  he  couldn't  just  not  fuck  a  fat  girl  that  day  because  all  of  his  friends  were  over  and  we're  laying  all  over  the  place  it  was  a  mine  field  of  friends  that  you  had  to  walk  this  through  Jimmy  looked  like  Jonestown  after  the  Kool-Aid  we  were  laying 
[02:21:00]  out  tiptoe  a  hippopotamus  out  in between  all of  his  buddies  he almost  makes it  to the door  and I think  my brother  just went  hey Adam  like laughing  and then we  all just  look up  and she's  like  and then  the girl  wanted to  meet  everyone  so she's  like  hi  and you're  just like  oh  get out  all right  get out  no turn  sideways  to get  through  the door  that was  so embarrassing  and of course  we left him  alone and  never acknowledged  it again  oh no

[02:28:30]  you have no idea  I sounded fantastic  who cares  I forgot the words  Anthony had a show  about two weeks ago  and a girl in the audience  she was you know  an attractive young lady  I thought she was  saying I love you  I love you  I got close  she said  your fly's open  wow  maybe she was saying  I love you first though  how you packing over there  your fly's open  that doesn't even  look like I love you  now when you  I don't know how guys  perform drunk  I never perform drunk  read my book  first four chapters 
[02:29:00]  it's only four chapters long  live from Betty Ford  it's the Eddie Money Show  come on  would you ever bail  early on the show  like just do a short set  not realize you did a short set  it depends if I got paid up front  if we got paid before the show  they were in trouble  what I noticed  whenever I  and of course Eddie  never at your capacity  and I would never want to  imply that I was  but when I was in bands  out on Long Island  sure  I knew a couple of bands  you were in  and my sister remembers  you guys  yeah right  yeah played at the Roxy  I met the guy from  the Good Rats yesterday 
[02:29:30]  gave him some crap  Peppy  yeah but no the other guy  he looks like my grandfather  for Christ's sake  yeah the  the old Rats  instead of the Good Rats  oh shit  the  god  the old Long Island  band  and the rich kids  and Epi was there  yeah  you know the guy  that used to charge you  for a pitcher of coke  you know  at my father's place  oh yeah  yeah  yeah he was  thrifty  Frank Cariola 
[02:30:00]  was another one  Frank Cariola  ran a lot of the clubs  on Long Island  there was a lot of dead people  getting awards  and I would hang out for that  so you weren't posthumous  that's good at least  it was a good thing  and there's a lot of great musicians  who presented you  I don't know  I can't remember  but I can't remember  he wasn't famous  but he was very perky  what the hell is going on  hey let's bring him on  did you quit drinking this morning  I'm looking for  I'm looking for some clean urine  my blood type is big  can you help me out here

[02:31:00]  no I don't really  I can't bet rapping  because my kids want me  to get in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  so they can tell their friends  right  yeah but at least  what you were doing  was Rock and Roll  yeah that's what I'm saying  like a lot of times now  they'll put people in  that were doing like  Madonna's pop  she's great  but she's pop  she's not Rock and Roll  and hip hop  you're right about that  it doesn't qualify as Rock and Roll  it's a popularity  let me write that down  you're right huh  I should send that complaint  jot that down  say what the fuck  you see what I was doing  can you say that on the air  oh it's satellite  we can say whatever we want  whatever we want

[02:51:30]  ugh  and uh  then they had uh  you  yeah  they had that other guy  that uh  Bologovic  oh yeah  Bologovic  Rob Bologovic  the former uh  yeah  uh mayor of Chicago  yeah  Georgie the governor  of Illinois  he opened up a briefcase  and a bunch of pistachios  fell out  something like that  my favorite was  is I did the ad  and then the uh  the next one doing  was the ad  and this is when  I almost killed myself  was the cat 
[02:52:00]  who plays the piano  you know that  fucking YouTube thing  oh that's hilarious  the cat  the cat who plays the piano  and the cat who played the piano  had more people  the manager  was with the cat  you opened for the cat  I opened for the cat  yes  the cat was complaining  as he was going long  the comic is fucking his lines up  yeah  they got you doing a few things  I've seen you on a few spots  for uh  things on TV  and then uh  yeah you're selling a book  what's that about 
[02:52:30]  it's called I'm Dreaming of a Black Christmas  it's Louis Black Black's  Christmas book  and it's got Louis  with a Santa hat  smoking a cigar  um  this your third book  yeah I gotta stay one ahead of you  uh  it's good  I'm happy for you  it's always good to see a friend  doing better  always good  hope there's a fire  at your first book signing  now that's uh  uh  obviously  you don't  you don't celebrate Christmas  do you  no  never have  so um  how would you  a Jew 
[02:53:00]  a Jew  write a book about Christmas  because I think  uh  you know  being  I'm not only Jewish  I'm single  so it's  I'm perfect to discuss  a holiday  that I'm watching  from the outside  and it's not really  and it isn't in the end  a condemnation  for Christmas  it's basically  he came to me  the editor came to me  and said  right  you want to write  a Christmas book  and I said  what the  exactly  what is the matter  with you  then uh  he said  you know 
[02:53:30]  I think  you know  he said  then he told me  Glenn Beck wrote  a Christmas book  oh boy  I was like  well then  fuck you  if he can write  a Christmas book  I can write  a goddamn Christmas  book  then anybody  can write  a Christmas book  not a big  Glenn Beck fan  uh  Lewis  I would think  politically  I think you're  a little far apart  from each other  well no  it's not even  politically  I think  what he's  really good  I wish  if I thought  he really  believed the  bullshit  I would go  okay  but he is  he was a  radio schmuck  right  you know  but I mean  and I'm not  putting  I mean  you're not a radio 
[02:54:00]  schmuck  yes he is  I am one of the  schmuckiest radio  schmucks  you will ever  schmuck  he's a radio  shit pile  I absolutely  am a piece of  crap  well I forgot  but  but he's what  he is  he's like  PT Barnum  that's who the  fuck he is  yeah  well  he generates  more cash  than anybody  there's a few  people I think  that are  kind of passionate  about whatever  beliefs they have  and other people  that see  an opportunity 
[02:54:30]  to make some  cash  and put on  the show  say the things  they think  people want to  hear  and they're  usually the ones  that get caught  with young boys  yeah  and it's like  oopsie  oh well  the jig's up  you got me  I was having  sex with a young  boy  isolate that  yeah isolate that  they'll be playing  that one  and here's Anthony  I was having  sex with a young  all right  finally the truth  comes out  but the worst 
[02:55:00]  thing that the  guy my editor  said to me  was that  the  that you  if you write  a third book  you'll love this  this will taunt  you  then they'll  consider you  an author  oh really  oh you're not  yet  fuck you  not now  I've got to  do one more  well if they  got two books  out on you  it must be  doing pretty  well  they wouldn't  ask you to  write the third  book  yeah  that was  I wrote a  draft and  they never  called me back  stick to singing  really  you know one  thing about being  Jewish though  when I grew up  with my kids  all my Jewish 
[02:55:30]  friends  I used to  love Hanukkah  because you  got presents  more than one  day  how many days  in Hanukkah  ah but they  were shit  presents  not really  all the Jewish  kids I knew  growing up  and going to  school  like I would  come in  after Christmas  you'd go back  to school  and all the  kids would have  like great  toys and stuff  and the poor  little Jewish  kids run around  just this piece  of shit  you'd get like  socks and a  pencil  yeah yeah  something  you didn't go  to Island  Trees in  Levitown  no no  my Jewish  friends had  money  I did go to  Timber Point 
[02:56:00]  Elementary School  in East  Islip  wow that was  nice  yeah  Sundays  Islip Speedway  right  yeah Sunday  Sunday  Sunday  Islip Speedway  oh it was  you could be  if the night  was humid  you'd be trying  to sleep  and you'd just  go  it's like  how far  is it  tracks in  the backyard  I slip  the night  was sultry  oh is that  it  the night  the night  was sultry  oh yes  that's right  money knows 
[02:56:30]  that's from  Throw Marmo  from the Train  of course  my favorite part  of Throw Marmo  from the Train  is the fact  that Danny DeVito  kept saying  I don't want  it to get  ruined  the way he  said ruined  ruined  ruined  it was great  so now Lewis  the book  Christmas  what kind of  insights do you  give us on  looking  I wrote a book  about being  single disguised  as a Christmas  book  oh ok  that was what  I really did  so you're  trying to get  laid and  take it out  on holidays  you don't 
[02:57:00]  tell people  that doesn't  work  not for comics  I spent years  since I've been  single so I  wouldn't know  for comics  it's like  you're funny  but you're  not that  fucking funny  now as far  as dating  goes though  has there been  instances  where dating  around the  holiday  you've had  to maybe  attend some  Christmas  family things  early on  especially in  my 20s  and 30s  I'd be living  with somebody  and then I'd  have to go  to their  family  and then  stupidly  be sitting 
[02:57:30]  there with  your family  and not  realize this  is the  moment I  should leave  the relationship  you're looking  around  you've got  enough clues  you're looking  around at the  hell that you're  going to inherit  and you think  no this will  work  I had  up  there was  this was  I was like  I was seeing  this lady  we go down  to Florida  we get there  now we have  to go shop  right  she's about  36 37  years old  both in our  late 30s  and she says 
[02:58:00]  to me  the father  says okay  you take  the car  you drive  hands me  the car keys  how's that  about  in front  of his  and I've  said  and I  literally  at that  point  I  drove  about a  block  away  and then  I got  I said  you're  fucking  driving  your  parents  car  I'm not  driving  your  fucking  parents  car  bless  I'm a  shitty  driver  bless  your  dad's  a  fucking  piece  of  shit  you know  you should  be  you know  that's  like  Miss  Daisy  you know  so  basically 
[02:58:30]  I've  been shown  in about  a 10  second  moment  that this  girl is  really  crippled  for the  rest  of her  that's  what I  count on  though  that's  the only  way  I love  damaged  goods  you know  we all  gotta work  with our  strong  points  mine is  a horrible  relationship  with a  father  I'm in  exactly  the more  years of  childhood 
[02:59:00]  that are  blacked  out  the better  I look  yeah I  need  dysfunction  as well  yeah it's  just shit  like that  but I  do recall  Christmas  I used to  when I  worked for  a living  and put  in air  conditioning  and heating  duct work  it was  wonderful  but my  ex-wife  at the  time  my wife  would be  like oh  we're taking  the week  between  Christmas  and New  Year's  and going  up to  see my  mom  up in  Massachusetts 
[02:59:30]  so we'd  get there  and she'd  be like oh  hello darling  it's so good  to see you  I have to  go to  Sears  could we  drive to  Sears  so we  would go  drive to  see us  now I'm  on vacation  I've been  working the  whole year  this is my  time  right sure  she buys a  fucking garage  door opener  oh no  and I'm just  thinking all right  she buys this thing  oh no  Anthony  would it be okay  if you installed  this in my garage  and then  it's kind of new  in the relationship 
[03:00:00]  and I didn't want to  come off as the dick  meanwhile she's coming off  like super dick  I'm on vacation  and there I am  twisting nuts  how long did it  take you to put in  it was like an  all day thing  because I wasn't  ready for it  I was probably  half in the bag  already  like uh  you gotta remember  this is the kind of  guy that fails shop  class  yes  20 minutes  I did  I was the guy  it took him two years  to make the salad bowl  I was the guy  salad bowl  no a bowl  that's what I'd  fucking make in  shop class  I could make a  bowl to smoke weed 
[03:00:30]  out of  out of anything  it's like what are we  making today  we're gonna make  some kind of a  drawer thing  a little tchotchke  drawer  meanwhile you open  one panel  turn the fucking  knob  and I'm smoking  out of it  of course the shop  teacher knew all  the pressure points  in your body  to make you  put you through  pain  the back of your  neck  these people  should not be  in education  should not be  in education  there was a shop  teacher in the  school system  I was a part of  who got in  trouble for dropping  some kind of a  fucking drug or a  mickey in the  principal's drink 
[03:01:00]  and so some other  teachers saw it  and they knocked  the drink over  yeah and then  he tried it again  and they filmed him  doing it and he got  in big trouble  did you say slip him  a mickey  or something  or a fucking  yeah I really did  it was in the 1930s  they had just  knocked over a bank  see  yeah I really  am a fucking fool  oh my god  what do you think  about the midterm  elections now  you know obviously  big change  everything's gonna be  great  is it gonna be  great now  I'm so glad 
[03:01:30]  we straightened  it all out  it was gonna be  great  now it's gonna  be great again  everything's gonna  be terrific  I have never  watched anything  now they've just  reached a point  where they don't  even tell us  what they're gonna  do  and they get  elected  what are you  gonna do  we're gonna  change everything  what but what  specifically  you're gonna do  we're gonna do  it  they're like a  Nike ad  just do it  that's all they are  and that piece of  shit ad  I've never understood  that fucking ad  just do it  what do what  you fuckers  exactly that's what a  rapist thinks  right before he commits  the act  and we got 
[03:02:00]  you know I mean  look  you know what I'd  like him to do  is  I'd like the  Democrats and  Republicans to  just figure out  how to get rid of  bed bugs in the  country  that's not gonna  happen  we're in a third  world country at  this point  we got bed bugs  are you fucking  kidding me  I asked my  mother who's 92  when they were  living in the  Bronx in like a  shithole apartment  did they have bed  bugs  they didn't have  bed bugs  back then  back then they  didn't have  fucking bed bugs  I had to hear a  PSA for this  woman on  1010 winds 
[03:02:30]  and I'm driving  and I listen  she goes  I have a  dengue fever  my joints  I'm like  dengue fever  what the fuck  are they even  talking about  dengue fever for  in this country  we should not  have  dengue fever  that's like  how do you get  that it's drinking  dirty water from  the Amazon  how  my friend  the only reason  the bed bug  thing  my friend  of mine  got an 
[03:03:00]  infestation  of this  him and his  wife  it's like  a 10 day  process  of total  they literally  move you out  of your apartment  and they fucking  steam this  and do that  and radiate  this  they freeze  things  they come  up with this  refrigerant  and freeze  your bed  freeze everything  and then it  apparently kills  the things  it's unbelievable  they actually  bite you  yeah they bite  you  they leave  little red marks  all over you  and it seems  that there's  no diseases 
[03:03:30]  directly  attributed to  them  but it's  disgusting  it's annoying  I wouldn't  want to have  bed bugs  and they're  really little  too  but you can  see them  they've shown  them  I'm convinced  now because  I've seen  a couple of  ads for  exterminators  that just  do bed  bugs  that they're  going to  hotels  with little  baggies full  of bed  bugs  sprinkle them  around  and then wait  for the phone  call  who wouldn't  do that  if you were  running a 
[03:04:00]  fucking bed  bug business  bed bug  business  I'm in the  bed bug  business  I went to  I was in a  bed bug  business  with his  father  and your  father he  brought the  bed bugs  there they are  yeah see  they're kind  of big  where are you  sleeping  and then you  go to the  hotels  and you  know  something  and I'm  constantly  I don't  want to  yeah yeah  you're in  you're probably  in some of  the sleaziest  hotels in  the country  I had them  growing up  I didn't know  what they  were I  swear to  god I  would see  them crawling  like in 
[03:04:30]  my room  which was  filthy  I thought  they were  summer  beetles  I thought  I had  little  summer  beetles  I really  did think  they were  summer  beetles  they're  blood sucky  ladybugs  and then  later on  he got  crabs  I had crabs  three times  you had crabs  three times  at least  you were  getting laid  what are you  worried about  same chick  twice in a  week  black girl  Danielle  that's  just your  fault  I know it  is  her vagina  I could  smell her  pussy  through her  pants  when she  was at  the bottom 
[03:05:00]  of the  steps  I'm not  kidding  she was  three steps  away from  me  and she  was a  deep sea  diver  it was  horrific  I still  got in  there  twice  three times  twice from  her and  once from  a girlfriend  I think  was cheating  on me  fool me  300 times  shame  on me  who was  the third  time from  a girlfriend  who was  cheating on me  oh  she had her  pubes all  shaved one  day  and then a few  days later  I had crabs  I didn't put  two and two  together and  go the whore  got crabs  and fucked  me before  she shaved  her pubes  rotten good 
[03:05:30]  egg she was  would she  use your  razor and  then you  had him  around your  mouth  that would  suck  no she  just trimmed  her pubes  she didn't  shave them  completely  this is  1992  or 1991  did you  mention that  to your  therapist  I have  therapy today  actually  why do I  withdraw when  a girl tries  to kiss me  and I feel  like I'm  being molested  that's what  we're gonna  cover today  why does  anyone needing  love from me  feel sick  and wrong  is that what 
[03:06:00]  you're covering  today  do you think  you'll ever  be at the  point where  you can  just accept  your life  who you are  and not  have to  go to therapy  or anything  I don't know  it's not bad  it's only an  hour a week  I know  it's only  an hour  a week  but do  you think  you'll ever  reach the  point where  you just  don't need  it  no  no  no  so he  says there's  no hope  you too  I'm with him  just like  there's  I just want  a place 
[03:06:30]  an hour a week  where I can  fucking unload  yeah  I mean just  go  the stage  isn't enough  no  you can't  stand on  stage and  go look  do you think  this is  psychotic  no  they watch  your show  and say  yes  he's psychotic  because you  have to be  funny on stage  a lot of times  you don't want  to be entertaining  with it  you just want to  spit it out  and get feedback  on it  your therapist  isn't going  no  just laughing  yeah  he has a little  mic when I  walk in  and I just  do my jokes  through a little  PA  and everybody  else in the  fucking  waiting room  can hear 
[03:07:00]  my  time's up  they red  light you  we're through  with this one  aww  so you're just  never  never going to  be fixed  no I don't  think so  always broken  a lot of  damage  yeah  how long  have you been  going  seven years  or something  yeah me about  the same  how about you  did you go  any or no  no  too expensive  no I don't  work with you  I'd rather talk  to myself in the  bureau  you fucked up  I know that  go back  get a pack  of cigarettes  yeah you  prescribe cigarettes 
[03:07:30]  to yourself  you know therapy  is when  my wife makes  me go to  put the marriage  back together  and I spent  what  $150 a week  I said this  ain't gonna work  forget about it  so I said  forget about  therapy  the only therapist  I ever went to  was my  ex-girlfriend  from  we were going  out for nine  years  she decided  to go to  therapy  you know  figure her  shit out  and  it was  it was  because  our relationship  was kind of  being affected  toward the end  and then she 
[03:08:00]  gives me the  great idea  of you know  my therapist  kind of  would like you  to come in  and me and  you and her  will sit  and this  and now I'm like  I have to go  it's either  break up  right now  or go  and I didn't  want to break up  right then and there  so I'm like  alright I went  I sat there  like the  the scourge  getting beaten  up by these  two women  that everything  was like  my fault  are you gonna  change 
[03:08:30]  and then  and then  I pulled a  checkbook out  and it's like  okay that was  good  just kick me  in the nuts  and I'll  fucking give  you a few  hundred  that's what  it felt like  couples therapy  I'm like  absolutely not  both go to  individual  fine  but I'm  not fucking  married  I'm not going  to couples therapy  I know you're  fucked up  I don't need a  therapist to tell  me that  and that's what  I felt like  too  it's like  look I'm  not married  why am I  doing this  if it's over  it's over  and it wound  up you know  being over  right  but so  maybe it was 
[03:09:00]  your attitude  that was the  problem  my attitude  and then  the thing is  with couples  therapy  and I went  probably three  times  and had it  you're done  you walk out  of the office  which of course  is just in some  nice house  in some nice  neighborhood  you walk out  and you're  supposed to  leave all that  in there  meanwhile I'm  getting in my  truck on  alright  and you know  alright cunt  the door's  unlocked  I mean oh  shit honey  yeah it's  unlocked  did I say  that  you can't 
[03:09:30]  I was incapable  of leaving all  that behind  the resentment  I felt  and then I  couldn't get it  out  what am I  going to be  there for  years trying  to get this  resentment  out and stuff  so no  it was just  like look  it's better  this just  my daughter's  therapist wants  me to come  in and see  her  I said come  on can we  do it on  the phone  or what  my daughter's  a mess  what do you  want from me  you can't fix  her leave  her home  what am I  going to do  I'm the one  that fucked  her up  why do you  want me  involved  of course  my wife  blames me  you did  drugs  the kids  will do  drugs 
[03:10:00]  I never  did drugs  in front of  the kids  make some  difference  I'm sure  they never  knew when  you came  home  now I  ask my  daughter  if she's  got any  papers  it's a  dysfunctional  family unit  yeah  dysfunctional  family unit  I had a  I did the  same couples  therapy once  and we  went in  and it was  we've been  living together  about a year  and then she  started fucking  around  and then  so she has  to go to  this therapy  thing  I'm like  I find out  about it  the night  before  I'm enraged 
[03:10:30]  and then all  of a sudden  now I am  sitting around  with the  guy therapist  who wants  to fuck  her  and he's  telling me  what a piece  of shit  I am  and I'm  the one  who caused  this  I'm going  are you  fucking nuts  what a great  way to  cock block  you  and then he's  describing my  problems  wait she was  cheating on you  and he blamed  you  yeah he blamed  me  because he  wanted a  fucker  because Lewis  Lewis's idea  of sex  he would put  her on her  stomach  and fuck  her in the  ass 
[03:11:00]  and call  her mister  some girls  might enjoy  that  that is  and he's  just  emasculating  you  oh yeah  he's like  you know  and then he's  telling me  you've got  he's describing  conditions  that he says  I have  and I said  well if I  don't have  those conditions  I can't  do what I  do for a  living  you fucking  puss  yeah don't  fix that  so I leave  totally enraged  that was  really just  what excuse  did he say  to anyone  to cause  someone to  cheat  what you 
[03:11:30]  weren't  providing  enough  emotional  support  and love  I had  problems  I was  the one  I had  driven  her  away  yeah  well  yeah  right  Lewis  it's  your  small  dick  he's  just  emasculating  you at  every turn  you come  too soon  she told  me  yeah I got  in the  I got her  in the car  I drove  her to  the guy  so she  could fuck  the guy  it's my  fault  did she  fuck  the therapist  or no  no she  didn't  fuck  the therapist  I don't  know  yeah you  don't know  you left  I just  know I 
[03:12:00]  it's hard  if you  guys  you guys  work days  Lewis and  I  we work  nights  so if  our ladies  cheat on  us  all they  gotta do  is look  in the  paper  oh he's  working  let me  go out  yeah look  in the  paper  how about  they know  when you're  working  at night  they know  where you  are  they know  what you're  doing  and you  don't know  where they  are  or what  they're  doing  fuck  days  and nights  though  because radio  is the  worst  because look  at this  hi I'm  in Manhattan  you know  I am  because you  hear my 
[03:12:30]  for at  least 45  minutes  if I ran  right now  how many  fucking  nuts can he  bust in  45 minutes  stop  isn't it an  awful thing  when you  think like  they know  where I am  my girlfriend's  too much of a  cunt in the  morning to  fuck anybody  that's the  beauty of her  she's a  fucking monster  when she  wakes up  but when I'm  out doing  gigs at night  she's probably  taking cocks  of all different  colors and  creeds  her fucking  vag is the  UN I'm  quite sure  but in the  morning she  hates being  unbothered 
[03:13:00]  so I'm  sure she's  really no  morning sex  I won't  do it  she probably  won't you  because I  hate it  I hate  morning breath  I don't  feel sexy  in the  morning  I want  to piss  and not  be touched  I'd never  fuck in  the morning  there's  nothing better  I got no  time thing  when it  comes to  sex  you can  fuck  in  the  morning  Louis  it's an  open door  24 hours  I'm 7-11  drop of a hat  I'm there  24 hours  because we  never get it  we're married  I'm married  so you take  it whenever  you  I like  the hardest 
[03:13:30]  part of  morning sex  is the  breathing  because you  you know  you're working  so you gotta  do the thing  you ever see  when a swimmer  turns his head  sideways  he goes  like sucks  the air  from the side  you gotta  breathe out  of the side  of your mouth  because you  don't want  to breathe  in her face  but you're  fucking  huffing  and puffing  disgusting  no kisses  really  no fuck  her doggies  I can't  stand  I go down  on her  first thing  and then I  can blame  my breath  on that  and that was you 
[03:14:00]  I just brushed  when he was  sleeping  you can brush  your teeth  yeah  kills the mood  not too fast  what do you mean  you just run  to the fucking  bathroom  yeah and then  she's been  sleeping  in her own  drool  so her cheek  smells like  spit  fuck that  I don't  like  I don't  like morning  sex  I like it  at night  last night  I've been  feeling weird  the last couple  days  I haven't  wanted sex  my girlfriend  and I wanted  to fuck  and I was  just like  look I'm  in a really  weird mood  I don't know  why  and I rolled 
[03:14:30]  over with an  erection  and went to sleep  I don't know  what that is  what's wrong  with you  I'm just a weirdo  you've got an hour  to figure it out  today  yeah  that's why he's  going and I  totally understand  well I always  jerk off in front  of my therapist  maybe I was just  saving it  try to arc one  real far  yeah onto her suit  onto her sensible  suit  her smart suit  does she wear a  smart therapist suit  yeah she really does  she looks like  she dresses like the  senator from  Silence of the Lambs  oh my god  love the shoes  love the shoes 
[03:15:00]  oh god damn  so Lewis how did you  know she was  fucking around you  cause she told me  oh she confessed  what'd she say  she said you know  basically she came  we were  she'd been out  and came back  one night  and things were  had been going  good  going bad  oh bad okay  so it was like  the  and you said  where were you  yeah I said  where were you  and she said  you know  I've had it  I've had it  it's not a good  answer when you  say where were you  yeah  her panties are  all askew  she's got fucking  hip hop on her  iPod  so uh 
[03:15:30]  how long did you  stay to get  why did you just  leave her at that  time did you feel  like you could  salvage it  or did you  you know  because it was  one of those  how do you  I don't know  you know  it was one of  those ones  when we  the sex  was so good  yeah  you know  the addictive  sex thing  that you know  it was like  and we would  go through  these cycles  and it would  go  it was great  great great  shitty shitty  shitty  fight  fight  fight  fuck  fuck  fuck  you know  the whole  battle cry  for UCLA  how long 
[03:16:00]  did you stay  together  after she confessed  uh  we stayed  together  we got back  together  about three  months later  and how long  after that  did you stay  together  uh  it's in the  book actually  oh wow  really  I didn't really  do it as a  setup  no  but she  just a simple  long story  short  um  then we end  up together  then she  gets pregnant  then she  uh  we get married  because I'm  that kind  of a schmuck  you got married  wow  yeah  but it lasted  that long  you and I  have been  married longer  actually  and then she 
[03:16:30]  uh  and then she  came in  four months  later  and told me  that six  months later  the baby's  not mine  oh my god  damn  yeah  so what  happened  she has  it now  yeah  no she  has it  we went  and had  blood tests  with the  guy  the kicker  was it the  same guy  holy shit  no totally  different guy  it was a guy  working I was  working in a  theater company  and uh  you know  and uh  and he was a  mime  how fucking good  are you kidding  but he's a great 
[03:17:00]  dirty talker  yeah  he makes  believe  he makes  believe that  he's pulling  beads out  of her ass  that was really  the kicker  a mine  a mine  knocked up  your chick  a mine  yes  yeah  let's make  a wall  wow  so would you  ever fuck her  and make her  tell you about  the fucks  like could you  use that to  be dirty  no  all right  no that would  be like  it must have  been complete  resentment  back then  I was like  oh it's a long 
[03:17:30]  time ago  yeah  did you think  about it  every day that  you were with  her though  that like  oh god  she was fucking  someone else  no  while we were  going out  were you fucking  someone else  no  oh boo  but I thought  about it  oh boo  I did after  okay good  good  what a juggler  I showed  you  I one-upped  you  he had a  bi-threesome  with the  captain and  Tennille  shields and  Yarnell  what was  what was  funny  I was in  a state  after this  whole thing  the strangest  thing  after this 
[03:18:00]  whole thing  goes down  with the  kid  I'm like  I'm totally  shell-shocked  because I  never expect  why would  you fucking  you know  I just  never crossed  my mind  there was  no Oprah  show  there was  nobody  was going  you know  there was  no everyday  60,000  things that  are so  bizarre  you couldn't  imagine  them occurring  so it's  like really  this happens  so I  would be  going out  with women  afterwards  and I  would just  tell them  the story  and then  they would  fuck me  at the time 
[03:18:30]  I'm just  telling it  to get it  off my chest  and go  you know  if I seem  a little odd  and I'm not  thinking  that's a great  Costanza  strategy  and then they  were like  you know  I'll make  it up to  you  and then I  started  you know  it was like  an amazing  kind of  thing  did you  ever  after  did they  ever  after sex  roll over  and go  I completely  understand  why she  did that  do you  know any  mimes  wow  that is  really  something  is she still 
[03:19:00]  with the  mime  what a  horrible  thing  she got  she  she left  him  and now  she married  some other  guy  and then  I think  left him  where the hell  did you find  this girl  she's really  an actress  good move  she was hot  there you go  do you hate her  are you friends  with her now  no I don't  talk to her  I don't hate her  I just  it's like  the only thing  that was odd  was she got  in touch  and said  that  I was  performing  in the town  and would I 
[03:19:30]  come and talk  to her student  like you know  what are you  fucking  gonna do you  a favor  she's a  teaching  of course  you should  have said  yes  and then  sent a  mime  guy walks  in  he's just  fake wall  look out  well here's my  motivation  a cunt  cheated on me  tell the story  with the students  and she  you don't mind  if I say  she fucked  a mind  so I  internalized  that and  used it  in my work  are you 
[03:20:00]  getting all  this  we drifted  totally  totally  you know  that was it  once that  happened  it was like  door shut  I'm not  dealing with  you  are you  one that  could be  any kinds  of friends  with exes  have you  done that  some of  them  are great  you know  in a way  because  Kathleen  Madigan  is a good  friend  she's your  ex  I didn't  know that  we dated  for like  three  you know  went out  for three  years  I like  Kathleen  and we  became 
[03:20:30]  but it  was like  it took  a bit  of a while  but we  were actually  you know  part of the  problem  was we were  such good  friends  it was like  hanging out  it would be like  hanging out  with you guys  I mean  it was like  we were not  I'm not going  to  you know  I'm not going  to pull your  crank  oh shit  as well  leave now  then  but no  and then  after  after we  you know  it's  it's been  you know  great  because we  we  we get it  it's like  now we  don't  there's no  bullshit  how many years 
[03:21:00]  ago did you date  that's it  how many years  ago  about 20  that's exactly  it though  you gotta  if you could  still remain  friends  and completely  throw that  thought  that you're  having sex  that you're  gonna have  sex  or wanna  have sex  out the  window  it ain't gonna  happen  we're just  gonna be  friends  then it  can work  or if it  didn't end  with some  horrid  resentful  thing  then it's  okay  there's a  woman also  that I  lived with  for seven  years  and I  can't  bear to  I  just  can't  talk  to her  no 
[03:21:30]  no  no  not  her  I'm  still  friends  with  her  you had  a woman  for seven  years  yeah  that was  a mistake  yeah  that was  a mistake  don't you  look back  sometimes  and go  I wasted  seven  years  but don't  you also  then see  your friends  who wasted  twelve  sometimes  fourteen  sure  yeah  or nine  yeah  I always  think back  right after  we had  nine  oh
