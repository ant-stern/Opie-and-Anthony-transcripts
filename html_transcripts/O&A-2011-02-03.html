<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, starting with a discussion of the Egyptian revolution. Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton described the violent clashes in Cairo, comparing the chaos to escalating childhood dirt bomb fights, noting the presence of camels and whips, and highlighting Anderson Cooper's physical altercation with the crowd.  They then criticized Fox News's coverage, particularly their focus on Rupert Murdoch's iPad app, drawing a humorous parallel to their own past sponsorship segments.  This segued into a sexually explicit discussion about the hosts' experiences with women from various cities.

The conversation shifted to Bill O'Reilly's claim that the moon proves God's existence, sparking a profane debate about the Big Bang, the universe, and the likelihood of extraterrestrial life.  The hosts continued to express their views on religion and science with considerable profanity.  The show then transitioned to a discussion of the conflict between science and religion, mocking creationist beliefs about dinosaurs – humorously imagining Jesus riding a velociraptor – and discussing the cloning of a woolly mammoth.

A listener call was followed by announcements of upcoming segments: a Carl Sagan parody, a discussion of the New York Islanders' poor performance (including a video of their goalie's embarrassing fight), and the playing of an 80s song by Anthony.  The upcoming interview with Ray Kurzweil, promoting *Transcendent Man*, was heavily promoted, with discussion of technological singularity, immortality, and Kurzweil's plans to virtually recreate his deceased father.  The potential ethical and social ramifications of advanced AI, including robot rights, were also contemplated using casual and offensive language.  The Islanders' goalie fight video was shown, followed by discussions of the Mets' financial problems due to Bernie Madoff, a Canadian weatherman's "hot cock" blunder, and stories about Billy Smith, a former Islanders goalie known for his aggression and drinking.  Otto from "Otto and George" was mentioned as a future guest.

A significant portion of the show featured the playing of an embarrassing cassette tape (later transferred to CD) of Anthony's band, with attempts by the sound engineer "D-Boy" to improve the audio quality.  Nervous Oscar, a guest in the studio, participated in a lengthy segment about his life, providing numerous humorous moments with his unusual accent and word choices.  The show also covered Michael Bloomberg's smoking ban, Charlie Sheen's 911 call, criticism of the Obama administration's healthcare policies and taxation, and Anthony's brother, Brother Joe, called in to promote his gigs.  A particularly embarrassing song from Anthony's band was played, following by a call-in segment where listeners harshly criticized the song and speculated on the band’s appearance and music video.

The broadcast included a detailed discussion of a *Davy and Goliath* cartoon episode,  and concluded with the hosts expressing their frustration with management interference at the radio station.  The playing of Anthony’s 80s song, "Dara," featuring Joe Curry, Mike Klotz, Louie Graziano, and Anthony's brother, was a central feature, generating much mockery from the hosts and callers due to its cheesy and sentimental nature, contrasting with Anthony's current persona.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  Here we go. Here's the bit.  At the controls, Reg Hughes, a father.  I would love to say we have the best job in America.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  It could be the best thing ever.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  Out loud laughs.  How do we explain the show?  We should start there.  Oh, here it is.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:00:30]  A popular radio program known for the cring style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, shit. This is a freak show.  Why would anybody want to come on this show as a guest?  Under the right circumstances, something weird could happen.  I don't give a fuck.  Laugh out loud funny.  Which I love. That's what I love.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  Because when you listen to our show, you know what you get.  You know what we are.  Everything has to do with cock or balls.  No, the jokes all end up talking about cock and balls. 
[00:01:00]  You're a waste of life.  Fucking listeners, go fucking die.  Excuse me.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people.  Real excitement.  Wow.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Morning.  Hi, everybody.  Wow, do we have a busy show for everybody today. 
[00:01:30]  Man, I was up a little late last night watching Egypt just go to shit.  Fun.  Any improvements?  Good TV.  Any improvement?  Oh, it's getting ugly.  It's crumbling by the minute.  It was fun watching them throw fire at each other.  They just would pick up fire and then throw it at the other people.  And then the other people would pick up the pile of fire.  I don't know what they were throwing.  Apparently, it was supposed to be Molotov cocktails.  But I always thought they just exploded and made fire in the street. 
[00:02:00]  But it was flaming things.  They would just throw.  Yes.  They would throw.  And then pick it up.  And then throw it back.  It was like a game.  That sounds like a lot of fun.  It did until like one of them hit the museum and it started on fire.  Oh, good.  They got a bus.  They got a little mini bus thing that was on fire and blazing in the middle of the street.  Why are they burning the museums?  Like we said a couple days ago, that's the only reason we go there.  They make a lot of money off tourism.  Leave your fucking museums alone.  They burned the museum? 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, yeah.  They've been looting.  They're destroying ancient irreplaceable objects.  Safe to say at this point, Mubarak is behind this, right?  A lot of reports coming in on the side streets.  They see the policemen going into buildings, whatever, and coming out, the same guys in civilian clothes.  It's like Superman.  They have to go, uh-oh, and then they go in.  They change their clothes.  They come out, and they start beating the fuck out of people.  Yeah, those are the pro-government guys.  Supposedly Mubarak.  Yeah, pro-government. 
[00:03:00]  Mubarak's been in there 30 years.  He's got tricks up his sleeve.  Yeah, of course.  But this one's not working too well, because people are on to them.  They're like, where are the-  Mubarak people, I think, coming back strong in the second half?  Hey, you know what?  This is way better than the Super Bowl.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Who gives a fuck about the Steelers and the Packers at this point?  No offense to those two cities.  Unless they start lighting the terrible towels on fire and throwing them at each other.  We're going to watch a dopey football game on Sunday when we can be watching this?  This is life and death shit.  And there's two solid fucking teams going at it right now. 
[00:03:30]  Two teams going at it.  It's great.  You got fire.  You got guys on camels with whips.  What does the NFL have?  And the Army's officiating.  Yeah.  This is fucking great.  You got F-16s flying overhead.  Any moment they could say, fuck it, and drop something.  Just drop something on them.  And you're going to watch a football game.  Fuck you.  And a silly Super Bowl commercial.  Yeah.  I was fixated on this last night.  I could not tune away.  You're hearing the machine gun fire from various sources. 
[00:04:00]  I guess now, the latest I heard, some of each side, the pro and anti-government people,  have gotten their hands on some weapons, on some fun.  Oh, boy.  On some fun.  So it's not just rock throwing.  Oh, boy.  Now they're rat-a-tat-tat, gat-ty-gat-gat at each other.  Which brings the numbers down.  Yeah, yeah.  That separates the men from the boys.  Men from the boys.  It's fun to have a little, like, protest if you're a young go-getter.  Yeah. 
[00:04:30]  But then you see those fucking guns coming out.  You're like, you know what?  I'm going to go look for pussy.  Think of it in terms of when you were a kid.  But over your rear fence, the back fence of your house, maybe you had a neighbor with  some kids your own age that maybe you didn't like very much, and you would start what is  called a dirt bomb fight, where you would take a pickup dirt that was clumped up and  hardened and throw it, and when it would hit, it would just go kind of poof.  Why are you explaining that to me?  I know.  Some people might not understand what a dirt bomb, because they called them dirt clods, 
[00:05:00]  some of the people.  But did you have moss fields, which made the best dirt bombs?  We were lucky enough to have moss, so then you're kind of ripping the moss, and it would  be a nice clump of dirt under the moss.  Here's what I had.  We had had a pool put in, above the ground pool, and they had leveled the ground and  made a pile of dirt.  That's exactly what you're talking about, right.  So that was left in the sun to dry some of the greatest weapons.  I was like fucking the United States with my weaponry.  But here's the deal. 
[00:05:30]  Everyone was in.  You were in.  All my friends, everybody.  No problem.  You're throwing dirt bombs.  The second that first pure rock flew over the top, and you just heard that clump, someone  got hit on the head with a rock, you'd start second guessing and being like, all right,  maybe this isn't fun anymore.  And you'd leave.  And then you'd move on.  Some people would start leaving.  Your numbers would start thinning out.  You'd go grab your bike and go for a ride.  Yeah, yeah, because you didn't want to get hit with a rock.  I didn't want to get hit with a rock.  Dirt bomb in the head is like, ah, shit, you know, poof. 
[00:06:00]  Did you do the stick thing, too, where you kind of had rules like, okay, we're running  out of dirt bombs, so we'll throw sticks.  But they can only be as wide as your, I don't know, middle finger, let's say.  I don't know.  My goal was always to have plenty of dirt bombs.  Really?  Oh, my military budget was way up there.  We went with sticks after we couldn't find any more dirt bombs.  I remember it's like it was yesterday.  And the same shit.  You start off with rules like, okay, man, just small sticks.  We can handle small sticks.  And by the end of it, you're throwing things as wide as your arm at people.  Yeah, big logs are going over the top. 
[00:06:30]  And we had a six-foot stockade fence in the back that you couldn't see through.  That's creepy.  Which really hampered negotiations.  Yeah, that's creepy.  Because you only heard like these, hey, no throwing rocks.  Screw you, you started throwing rocks.  We never throw a rock.  There was one in a dirt bomb, maybe, but we, I was going to fuck you.  And then the war starts again.  Fuck your government.  So if you couldn't see the face of your enemy, it made it that much easier to just lob whatever you could over the top. 
[00:07:00]  If you had a little, you know, post and rail fucking four-foot fence, the guy's right in front of you.  So that's what is going on in Cairo.  Yeah, yeah.  In this square.  It has turned to a rock.  How do you pronounce the square?  Tahrir?  Tahrir.  Tahrir.  Tahrir.  Tahrir.  Tahrir.  Tahrir.  Tahrir.  Yeah, it has something to do with freedom.  Freedom Square.  I don't know what it is.  Aren't they all, though?  Freedom Square.  Why does a complete lack of freedom always happen in something called Freedom Square?  I couldn't get enough of the camel guys.  Camel jockey guys are great. 
[00:07:30]  And that's when you realize it's going to take a lot, many, many, many, many more decades before we get along with the rest of the world.  We can't relate to a guy and a camel with a whip.  Imagine you're walking around Times Square.  All of a sudden, a guy comes through on a camel with a whip.  Riding a camel, whipping people.  You'd be like, what?  Really?  Really?  Is that happening?  How does that happen?  Is that happening?  It looked like something out of Lawrence of Arabia.  I didn't even know you could ride a camel in that way.  That fast?  I had no idea.  Like you'd lumber on a camel, you know, just kind of take a little ride. 
[00:08:00]  No idea they could move like that.  That guy was fucking in a full gallop.  No problem.  He knew how to handle a camel.  On a camel.  And you handle a camel if someone said, we're going to war, get your camel and get out there?  I could probably sit on a camel and take one of those dumb pictures in front of the pyramids.  But as far as full gallop on a camel as you're whipping people, no.  Yeah, you got him whipped, too.  I'm out.  Yeah.  Not only do you have to keep your balance on the camel and those weird humps. 
[00:08:30]  He's in between the giant humps.  Is that where he was?  He was in between the big humps, just kind of bouncing back and forth.  I thought you were supposed to sit on the hump.  Nah, that hump is a little gooey.  See, I didn't even know that.  Yeah, they store their water in there.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  I kind of do that, I guess.  But I thought there was some kind of hard shell.  No, they sit like in that trough between the hump.  Oh, that seems like it would be easy.  Easier than a saddle.  Well, it's kind of a regular saddle.  But I'll tell you, that camel fucking spine's got to be up your ass.  No kidding. 
[00:09:00]  Nothing hurt more than riding bareback.  Like when I was out in California, sometimes you'd just like, in the middle of the night,  you'd throw a fucking, you know, throw a bit in a horse's mouth and jump on him bareback.  And you'd just fucking ride like that.  And it was hard to hold on.  You'd really had to squeeze your legs around and hold on.  But whenever it would get into a trot, you got to watch.  If your balls like slipped underneath you a little bit, you'd fucking do that.  But I noticed all the girls that were like between fucking 12 and 16 at the time.  Went for a lot of rides.  They loved riding fucking bareback. 
[00:09:30]  Wow.  Wow.  She's riding again.  They loved it.  I barely saw any of those girls put a saddle on their fucking horse.  You think that's like when we discovered the ropes in gym class, that feeling?  I think it's more like discovering just grabbing and ripping, yanking your cock.  Jesus.  Because that's, I mean, they're trotting their horse.  Yeah.  And it's like right there on their vag.  They're just dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk.  Right on their special spot.  See their brand new boobies getting all stiff-nippled? 
[00:10:00]  Brandy new boobies.  Bunch of horse fuckers.  That's all girls are.  Just horse fuckers.  It was great.  Did Mubarak talk last night?  I was watching one of the news channels this morning.  They're all the same to me.  Sorry.  I don't pick a particular news channel.  I watch them all.  I watched.  And it all just blends in together for me.  But it looked like they had a clip of Mubarak.  But I don't know if he talked in the middle of the night or did he?  I know everyone.  He talks through other people.  No, he was in front of a podium. 
[00:10:30]  I don't know if it was like stock footage.  Yeah, it might have been something already.  Yeah.  I know they were telling everybody just get the fuck out.  Tell them to get out of the square.  Who's telling them, though?  The government.  Whoever's in charge.  But it wasn't him directly.  Yeah, but they went at the TV station.  Got word from the government.  But see, if the military wants to stop this, it's pretty easy.  You roll in those tanks.  Yeah, but they don't want to.  But now they might have to because you got pro and anti just throwing. 
[00:11:00]  You don't have pro and anti.  Oh, you got Mubarak's people.  His thugs.  And I bet you half those guys don't even want to be doing what they're doing.  But they don't have a choice.  Yeah, his thugs.  Yeah, but if the military really wanted to control the situation, I'm sure they could.  Not without some bloodshed, I think.  If they just set up a riot line and started pushing into the crowd to make them disperse.  Right.  I think they wouldn't disperse.  And I think you'd have to start racking some head. 
[00:11:30]  You're right.  And I guess tomorrow's going to be another big gathering.  Friday gathering.  Like yesterday wasn't supposed to be a big day.  It turned out to be a huge day.  If you were there, would you go there?  Would you go to take a look?  I was thinking about that.  I'd be, I'd go.  But I'd be on the outskirts.  I'm not even going to fucking front.  I'm not going to make believe I'd be right in the middle of the action.  But I would go and check it out.  Definitely.  Because Anderson Cooper got his head punched a little bit. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  Anderson Cooper got a little fucking worked over.  I'm surprised that's all he got.  Like they didn't hurt him badly.  They just threw a few punches.  They threw a few punches.  They're mad at the Western press because of lies and rumors.  And they're saying that the government is, they don't seem to be coming out on the side of the government.  They seem to be pro-protesters.  Yeah.  So some of the thugs got up there and, you know, shook him up a little bit.  I got the audio.  Gave him the old what to think about. 
[00:12:30]  Well, let's take a listen.  It's Anderson Cooper trying to get through the Egyptian crowd while being fucking.  Why didn't they punch me and kick me?  I'll say it again because it's my favorite term lately.  He was getting falcon punched on his way out of the square.  He's been hit now like ten times.  I love it.  Yep.  Egyptian soldiers.  Egyptian soldiers are doing nothing. 
[00:13:00]  You know what?  Fuck you, Anderson Cooper.  They're a little busy.  Start swinging.  He's like, he's hoping an Egyptian soldier, excuse me, is going to help them.  He goes, I like when he goes, I've been punched ten times.  And then you hear whack.  You hear another punch come in.  Eleven.  The soldiers are busy doing all this shit.  They're not going to protect.  They're not there to protect the media.  You're a white haired ass.  You decide to get your ass in the middle of it because you want to be some kind of rock star for CNN.  That's your problem.  He couldn't stand out anymore with that white hair. 
[00:13:30]  I know.  I know.  He really is.  He reeks of Western journalists.  He sure does.  Don't want to be fucking in the middle of that.  Hey, calm down. 
[00:14:00]  Calm down.  Oh, yeah.  That's good.  All right.  That is a panicked man.  I'm watching video.  The crowd is surrounding you towards him.  Show up.  Show up.  Calm down.  Calm down.  Calm down.  Calm down.  Calm down.  Calm down.  Calm down.  Calm down.  Calm down.  Calm down.  Calm down.  Calm down.  Calm down.  Calm down.  Calm down.  Calm down.  And they're just yelling strange words at you.  I'm in the middle of that.  You're hitting it.  This is the footage.  There's some guys trying to help them.  They're yelling stuff at him you never want to hear. 
[00:14:30]  No, you don't want to hear that tone, that language.  Even if he's yelling, have a good day, in their language, it just always sounds awful.  I've never heard happy fucking Arabs.  He's lucky.  Yes, he is.  I mean, the energy and the emotion that's in these people, he's lucky that they didn't  just fucking go way too far with him.  Head on a stick, just parading it through the square.  Parading the white-headed fucking skull.  The white-headed fucking Western journalist.  He's lucky they don't totally hate Americans as much as a lot of other countries do.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Because they would have literally beaten him to death right there and set him on fire. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, because most of these people know that our government has supported Mubarak, so they're  confused out there.  Damn.  Right?  We've supported Mubarak for the last 30, 31 years.  And this is a kid.  So they're like, what the fuck?  What side are you on, America?  This is also a case of...  Right?  Am I right or wrong?  But they also don't like the Western journalists spreading bad things about Mubarak.  These are Mubarak's thugs.  It's not the protesters.  And they feel that the Western journalists have been smearing his good name. 
[00:15:30]  Right.  And...  So, okay, there's two things going on.  So that's the pro-government...  Yeah, pro-government people.  ...quote pro-government people going after Cooper.  But I'm saying the anti are also a little confused about America and Americans.  Yeah.  They're not fucking blindsided, though.  Right, right.  I think that's why they probably showed restraint, though.  If they're really cops, and they might be military guys that are just not dressed, they probably 
[00:16:00]  know that just murdering an American reporter on camera is a problem.  If they killed Anderson Cooper, someone's going to look into it.  Yeah, I mean...  Because it's weird to see the mob not fucking...  You talk about...  Sorry, Jimmy.  Sorry.  I just saw something on TV I'm going to go to in a second.  I apologize.  That's fine.  No, go ahead.  Well, we all have our images and our videos that we're loving about this Egypt thing.  The panicked gunman walking backwards looks like it's from a comedy.  Yeah. 
[00:16:30]  Of the military gun?  Yeah.  He is freaking...  And his eyes are bug-eyed.  He doesn't know what to do.  He's going to try to shoot his way out, and he's just backing up with that gun.  It's probably the most amazing image I've seen so far.  Although the camels, guys with the whips, are right up there.  Camels, good.  I like the truck backing into the guy's face.  Hezbollah militant escapes from Egyptian prison amid chaos.  Of course.  A lot of prisoners are gone.  They said...  They released a lot of guys.  They said, Mubarak, just open the doors to the prisons and let people out. 
[00:17:00]  Gave the word.  Let the fucking riffraff out.  Fuck this.  He's definitely not this guy that's going to be like, okay, everything's fine, and not  do anything.  He's kind of taking it personally.  He's really fucking 30 years in power.  He's taking it a little personally.  Their barricades stink.  Dude, those guys in that region all know how to handle their citizens.  Saddam knew how to handle their citizens.  Mubarak knows how to handle his citizens.  We're nice.  We try to be nice. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, let's talk it over.  They are fucking brutal.  The only difference is Saddam didn't have all of his shit broadcast on a daily basis, all  of his riffraff.  Like, believe me, if this wasn't being broadcast, he would have swept in there and crushed this  fucking uprising in a second.  But nowadays, just like anything else, just like a cop going out there and fucking taking  his stick out and beating some motherfucker that was taking him on a high-speed chase 
[00:18:00]  because he's pissed, you know, that's the deal.  I mean, this obviously can't continue.  What do you think happens?  My thought really quick is that it has to calm down, unfortunately, because there's no real  plan when Mubarak leaves.  And then it goes back to sort of business as usual until September when he steps down.  I don't know how else this plays out because they don't have a guy ready to step up and  lead.  How are these guys not being pulled off the camels and beaten to death?  Some of them were being beaten. 
[00:18:30]  Some of them pulled off the horse.  I saw a horse, like, pulled down.  They pulled the horse down onto the ground and just started pummeling some guy.  What do you think, Ian?  Here's how I see it.  I'm pretty much the straightforward dictator, isn't really going to give a shit.  And he let this shit go long enough.  Once, especially tomorrow when they really start getting numbers in there, you're going  to see some violence.  And then that'll give him an excuse to send in his military to quell the violence under 
[00:19:00]  the guise of protecting and restoring order.  That way, he's not going to get shit on by the rest of the world because he can't just  sit here and watch his people kill each other.  So it'll give him an excuse to at least have something to say to the world like, hey, I  have to do something and kind of mind your own business.  I'm, you know, stopping my people from civil war over here.  Yeah.  So that's what happens. 
[00:19:30]  I think by the weekend, the latest, you're going to start seeing the military move in  and start really clearing these fucking people out.  And this thing starts kind of calming down.  I think tomorrow's the season finale of this series.  Yeah, yeah.  And then we'll have a couple reunion shows.  Reunion shows.  A couple little follow-up shows.  You know what, though?  I don't think he's going anywhere.  I don't think so either anymore.  I think he'll quell this.  I think it's...  He'll go, look, I'm stepping down in September, so, you know, deal with it.  This peaceful transition of power ain't going to happen. 
[00:20:00]  No.  This is going to be the quelling of an uprising by a dictator.  That's what you're going to say.  That's it.  I think you're right.  So, but just great TV last night.  And then below you have the father who did the honor killing, the Iraqi father.  Oh, yeah, that's wonderful.  That mentality we just cannot live with.  Jim, it's just a few people.  He ran his daughter over and her mother, or his daughter and his boyfriend's mother with a car because she was dishonoring him. 
[00:20:30]  It's this fucking shitty arrogance and this male, fragile male.  Their egos are so fucking embarrassingly fragile.  Yeah, yeah.  They're so threatened by women.  It's so irritating.  Isn't that true?  They're just completely...  We can't look at you.  Cover your face.  I think you're supposed to be these strong men.  You can't handle looking at women.  It's embarrassing.  They freak out.  They can't look at women.  They won't let women do anything in case, God forbid, a woman went to school and was educated and wound up doing things better than they did. 
[00:21:00]  How would they handle that?  So, yeah, they wrap them up.  They keep them stupid.  They beat them.  And they do these honor killings, which is, you know, how do you negotiate with a country that condones honor killing?  Stop it.  Because you feel dishonored.  Dishonored?  That's your ego.  What? 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Silly.  Yeah.  All right.  They're savages.  Yeah.  They really are.  Well, and I guess, what time is it now there?  12, 635.  What time is it?  12, 635.  Oh, in Egypt?  Yeah.  It was seven hours ahead.  I finally figured that out.  So, what do we got?  6, 12, 1.30?  1.30.  Is that about right?  It's the middle of the afternoon.  And how much is going on right now?  This is prime time.  Yeah.  This is prime time for the Egypt show.  I don't know.  Night time seemed to start.  Fuck.  Night time rocks.  Right when it turned night over there, around 6.37. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  They started really going bullshit.  I mean, you heard the crack in a gunfire, and they fired some tank shells over the crowd,  and the crowd was throwing fucking fire at each other.  The fire tossing, like you said, was amazing.  The fire, the Egyptian fire toss.  It's going to be an Olympic event.  Did you watch a little Anderson Cooper, because it was all about him yesterday, doing his  show from someone's house?  You know what?  And he said they were going to have a full production with lights and stuff, and they  were told, look, turn down all your fucking lights.  Turn the fucking lights off.  There's lunatics outside right now. 
[00:22:30]  I was watching some English guy fucking broadcasting on Fox News from a balcony, like he was laying  down on a balcony with a camera just kind of fixed on the crowd.  I flip around, and I got to tell you, man, Elliot Spitzer is not getting it done.  Man, his delivery just sucks.  I was flipping around, and all of a sudden it was like Elliot's time, and I'm like, I  can't watch him.  He's not good to look at to begin with.  He's a little awkward. 
[00:23:00]  And then his delivery is very weak.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  He's not cut out for that type of...  I was bummed, so then I forgot where I went after that, but he's just a downer to watch  and look at, man.  Here's something that was just, I mean, Fox News, whatever.  All this shit's going on in Egypt.  I want to see the coverage.  I'm watching.  But they deemed this newsworthy, like it was an actual news thing, and I'm sure Rupert Murdoch  made them do this.  Every Fox thing was covering it. 
[00:23:30]  His release of the app for the iPad called The Daily, it's an app.  It's the first real subscription-based newspaper, entertainment magazine.  It's like your all-in-one kind of news connection.  Made for the iPad.  Made specifically for the iPad.  It's 99 cents a week to subscribe to it.  It's like a newspaper without the paper. 
[00:24:00]  And he did this big press conference talking about it, and Fox News covered it as a news  story.  That's weird.  And they kept covering it, but every time they covered it, it wasn't a news story.  It was a fucking infomercial for an app.  I mean, there's real news going on, and CNN didn't talk about it at all.  Why would they?  They're working on their own version.  MSNBC wasn't talking about it.  I'm sure they're all working on their own versions now.  But Fox News, you know, they had an interview with Rupert Murdoch, and they're doing this,  like trying to make it like it was news, and it belonged on the news channel, but it didn't. 
[00:24:30]  It was a commercial.  You mean it's kind of like you're listening to a show, and you're like, wait, I think  this is the radio show I really like, but it seems like they're doing a commercial for  Steven Singer.  Yeah, why would the guy from the jewelry store they do commercials for be on the show?  Is that what you're talking about?  Did they kind of do what we did yesterday?  Holy shit.  That is exactly to a T what happened. 
[00:25:00]  Shit.  This is my favorite radio show, but it kind of seems like this has nothing to do with  their show.  Would they really sit around and talk about these gold-covered roses?  Oh, no.  With a little too much excitement in their voices?  Yeah.  My girlfriend really liked it.  She liked the rose.  I didn't know if she would or not.  You never know what you're a chick, you know?  She loved it.  Yeah, that's awesome.  Yeah, she really did.  You know what it was?  Because we were fucking goofing on him, and he didn't take a goofing, which is good.  It's not like sponsors that want to come in, shake hands, and go, well, this has been 
[00:25:30]  a great relationship with us, and blah, blah, blah.  He goes with it, at least.  Yeah.  But let's be honest.  It was kind of a half-hour infomercial yesterday.  Yeah, well, you know, what are you going to do?  You've got to be honest with the people.  His assistant was nice to look at.  He knows to bring around a pretty assistant.  Who does she look like?  It drives me nuts every time she's in.  She does look like some kind of, what, a celebrity or something?  She looks like somebody, doesn't she?  She resembles...  Come on.  ...your girl.  Really?  Yeah, she does.  And there's something about her face.  And you're saying no. 
[00:26:00]  Something about her face that reminded me...  Well, I should have...  She's a pretty blonde girl.  I should have figured that one out.  No, but there was something in the face.  I don't know if it's that Philly thing, but there was something that reminded me of her.  It's certainly that she couldn't pass as her sister.  Is that a Philly thing?  Yeah, I think so.  I mean, she just looked like a pretty Philly girl.  Philly girls rule.  I've never had good success with them.  They're always hot.  Jimmy doesn't like the Philly girls.  I hate them, but...  I love what Jimmy...  Dude, I've struck out.  In all the things I've done in Philly, I might have gotten blown once.  And that's going back since 1990.  Do the impression of the Philly girl. 
[00:26:30]  I don't even know what was the impression.  What's going on?  What's going on?  I'm like, hey, listen.  I would love to...  What's going on?  What's going on?  What are you doing?  I still say that.  What's going on?  What's going on?  What's going on?  I've had terrible walking...  Boston girls, however.  Yeah.  Totally different vibe.  And the greatest get-laid city in the world, Cleveland, Ohio. 
[00:27:00]  Cleveland is great.  Cleveland and Boston duke it out, though, because Boston girls are fucking good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Cleveland girls are unkept, though.  Yeah, but who cares?  They are.  We're not talking.  They're growing fucking pelts for the winter or something.  They're just talking straight forward.  Dirty girls who fucking up.  They like their pelts.  Philly girls, the ones I've run into, have always been teasers.  Yeah.  And then they just don't come...  It's like they dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, and I take it out.  Ooh, what are you doing?  What is that?  So that's where my behavior is coming. 
[00:27:30]  A lot of what is that?  Dude, I've fucking so many times.  And I called him out on it, too.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  Send me naked pictures, and you wonder why I'm grabbing your vagina?  Fucking idiots.  No, let's talk about Egypt for another hour.  Jesus.  That's great.  Yeah.  Hey, you mentioned Fox.  You hear about Bill O'Reilly?  Bill O'Reilly.  Doing our news break here, I guess.  What is that?  And don't worry.  We'll talk about the Islanders in a second.  I showed Anthony the fucking video.  We'll get there in a second. 
[00:28:00]  Bill O'Reilly offers evidence that there is a God who put the moon there.  Bill O'Reilly offers us this?  Yeah.  Through what?  Huh?  Like, did someone tell him, or did he have a fucking revelation?  He's probably watched something on YouTube, and he went, oh, that sounds like I didn't  say that.  You're sort of a Fox guy.  I've got to ask you a question.  Yeah.  Why does Bill O'Reilly, who certainly has credibility, obviously with his audience and  in general, in general, why does he put up with Glenn Beck? 
[00:28:30]  I don't understand that at all.  Because Glenn Beck, it's safe to say, he's a lunatic, and he's out of his fucking mind.  Yeah.  It really is safe to say.  It is, right?  Yeah.  But I see-  I think it's that camaraderie, buddy, buddy.  Look, we're kicking ass on every other news network out there.  But Bill O'Reilly is the main guy over there.  He doesn't need to deal with Glenn Beck.  And I saw the other night that Glenn Beck was on his show, and I'm like, why don't  you call this guy out for being a lunatic?  No, they don't want to do that.  It's like they're fucking all- they're all on a winning fucking team. 
[00:29:00]  I don't know, man.  I think it's going to end very poorly for Glenn Beck.  I hear his ratings are down, and a lot of people noticing that he seems like he's out  of his fucking mind.  He was off last night, too, and they said he was feeling a little under the weather.  Really?  Yeah.  Someone, I forgot who it was, one of the news channels, making a network comparison  with Glenn Beck at this point.  Really?  Yeah.  Where you're watching a guy just unravel on TV.  I watched Glenn Beck, like, when he first came on, and it was like, all right, here's 
[00:29:30]  a guy, he's another conservative guy, whatever, I'll just listen to his fucking ramblings and  shit.  But as time's gone on, and he's pulling out his blackboards, and he's talking about,  like, history, and then when he goes to break, he's very serious, and he just strolls around  the stage as they show him before they go to break.  He really looks like a man just coming apart at the seams. 
[00:30:00]  I've never watched- this is the- it's like, I always see people that attack him, like,  for real, I think, you know, Beck is evil, and I'm almost like, why do you watch him?  Like, who cares?  Yeah.  I've never- I've heard he's crazy, but I've never watched his show.  I don't know what he's like.  Yeah, it's not- the point isn't that he's crazy, the point is he's getting crazy.  Yeah, he's getting crazy.  We're watching it happen.  So you agree with this?  Oh, absolutely.  Oh, wow.  We agree on something.  No, I absolutely agree.  As far as this news politics thing goes.  He's fucking out there.  Yeah, because I noticed a while ago, and now people are, in general, just like, what 
[00:30:30]  the fuck is going on with this guy?  Because even his sense of humor comes across as a crazy person trying to make a joke.  Right.  Like, when Hannity throws something out there as a goof, goofing on someone on the panel  or something, it's funny, you know, he knows sarcasm, he knows how to make a joke.  When Beck does it, he, like, has this delivery, like, aha, right, right, right, and you're  watching TV going, ah, this guy's going to come out of my television set. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, boy, fuck off, shit dick, Opie, fuck off, Opie, shit dick.  Well, I guess you're a fan of Glenn Beck.  Oh, shit dick.  No, it is Glenn Beck.  So where's the fuck off Anthony, too, because he agrees, asshole.  Ah, fuck off me, too.  Please, fuck off me, too.  Fuck off me, too.  Don't you want to get a fuck off as well?  It's fun.  Come on.  It's fun to get a fuck off.  Sorry, but your boy, I guess that's a fan of Glenn Beck, your boy is unraveling.  He really is.  And it's going to become more and more obvious in the coming weeks and months. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  You heard it here almost first, because other people have started saying it, but we're on  board with this, and I like the network comparison, because that would rule.  If he's just on the air.  If he's really unraveling, I'm going to watch him every night.  Well, that's just it.  I tune him in every so often, because he's crazy, and I want to see him be crazy.  We always talked about, like, wouldn't you watch a show if somebody was just insane doing  the show?  And that, I think, is why people tune in to watch it.  You think? 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  Who's tuning in to fucking Anderson Cooper, unless he's getting beat up by Egyptians?  Yeah, that's great for Anderson Cooper, because I watched last night, because, well, fuck,  this is the guy that got beat up.  I've got to watch him now.  Now the other...  Elliot Spitzer, go away, man.  Holy shit.  You think the other news networks are going to try to start...  Getting a kook?  Like, get their guy in there to get beat up so they get ratings?  You know what it's all about?  The other news networks, outlets, whatever, are jealous that Anderson Cooper got beat up 
[00:32:30]  and everyone's talking about it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Of course.  So you want your guy to be beat up.  That's what you need.  Yeah.  Bill O'Reilly talking about a god.  David, Beverly Hills, Florida.  What do you mean when you refer to the tides, when you ask about the existence of God?  Science explains the tides, the moon's gravity pulls on the ocean.  Okay, how'd the moon get there?  How'd the moon get there?  Look, you pinheads who attacked me for this, you guys are just desperate.  How'd the moon get there? 
[00:33:00]  How'd the sun get there?  How'd it get there?  Can you explain that to me?  No.  How come we have that and Mars doesn't have it?  What?  Venus doesn't.  They do have it.  They do.  And they do have...  A lot of the planets have moons, Bill.  Do you know what?  It's because the proximity to the sun and atmosphere and things that happened on this planet, geological things that happened on the earth millions and millions and millions and billions of years ago, that just happened and we ended up here.  I don't think it's so much the end product where we're here and everything happened to bring us here. 
[00:33:30]  I think it's a coincidence that the chain of events of things that happened brought us to where we are now.  So I don't think it was a grand plan.  I think it was just we happen to be the right distance from the sun.  I mean, this might have...  We're in the Goldilocks zone.  Yeah, the Goldilocks zone.  This might have happened in some other solar system somewhere else that we don't know about.  We don't know.  But for the most part, it's pretty rare, at least locally, as far as we can see, which isn't that far at all, that there are... 
[00:34:00]  I mean, there's life like us.  We can't really...  Well, yeah.  But NASA just said yesterday that their Kepler telescope, which is like that planet-finding telescope,  they found something like 50-something planets within that Goldilocks range.  Really?  From the sun?  Yeah.  Where life, you know, could legitimately...  There has to be life elsewhere.  There has to be.  I don't know how people...  It's stupid not to think that.  Absolutely.  I don't know how people think otherwise.  There has to be.  I don't understand.  There has to be.  Religion has changed so much. 
[00:34:30]  They're trying...  Because they're so embarrassed now at how...  It's almost like the fucking 9-11 conspiracy people.  Now, you know, they say, yes, a plane did hit the Pentagon, but we think it was a different kind of plane.  They had to.  Yeah.  These assholes.  That's the same thing.  After all being told, a time after time after time, religion is finally like, oh, maybe this does happen,  but they're still trying to shoehorn their garbage.  Yeah, yeah.  How has the moon formed?  I can't tell you exactly, but it's something to do with a collision, and then it just stayed because our gravity keeps it here.  Right.  Probably a collision of some sort.  The gravity...  You assholes.  The gravity of every planet in our solar system keeps everything in balance and keeps everything moving around. 
[00:35:00]  The moon wasn't placed there by this giant hand of a bearded man.  In space, in heaven.  It just happened to fall into that zone.  And then it smooths out because of the rotation.  Yeah, yeah, and being pummeled over the years from fucking other things and solar winds and fucking...  There's just a lot of shit that happened that made things the way they are. 
[00:35:30]  And when you talk about God and he goes, how did the moon get there?  How did the sun get there?  Then you got to go, well, how did God get there?  Yeah, yeah.  Like, how did that...  Well, he just happened.  Well, this shit just happened.  But how did God just happen?  Like, we can't wrap our fucking brains around this shit.  Well, Bill O'Reilly can, and we're pinheads if we don't agree with him on this, I guess.  Like, if everything has a beginning, like, all right, then how did God happen?  Yeah.  And what was before God?  Well, God was before God. 
[00:36:00]  Well, how did that happen?  Nothingness.  I like the concept of nothing because you can't even deal with it because it would have  to be something...  It creeps me the fuck out.  Infinite nothing is what was supposedly here before things like the Big Bang, if you believe  in that, or God, if you believe in that.  But God always existed.  But that whole thing of the universe, which is endless, being nothing.  But what is that?  You can't wrap your mind around it. 
[00:36:30]  Bill O'Reilly isn't going to fucking explain it.  But here's the thing.  If there's a city of God, okay, probably, maybe, possibly, why would he stick the fucking  moon there?  What the fuck is he doing?  It's a dumb, lumpy planet.  And why would...  It's a satellite.  It's there to adjust our tides.  Really?  So that's what God needs?  He's like, well, I can't do this without following the laws of physics.  Yeah, couldn't God just have fucking made the tides happen without the moon? 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, you got some nice tides.  Why do we need tides?  God doesn't give a fuck about tides.  He's going to put a shitty moon there that we can't even inhabit.  Why do we need the sun?  Wouldn't it be more godlike if it was something that we couldn't even explain?  Yeah.  Like, heat is coming from just nowhere.  And it's godly.  Can I add to this, too?  Is God just a god for our little area?  Yeah, yeah.  Or is he the god for the whole universe?  Is he our landlord?  And if he is the god for the whole universe, then does that mean there's life elsewhere 
[00:37:30]  that he decided to create?  Or did he decide to just create it in this one fucking planet?  I think it's just us.  You really do?  Oh, yeah.  And when you go, like, say, nine or eight billion light years...  Which is nothing.  Which is six trillion miles per light year.  Yeah.  And those multi-billion star universes, they mean nothing.  They're just window dressing for us religious people.  You're just assholes.  And we're just fucking pompous assholes as human beings. 
[00:38:00]  Not because you believe in God.  Because I kind of do and I want to.  But if you really think that this shit pile is the fucking center of it all,  and he stuck some guy with an ark, and he sent all the animals...  And you believe that literally, you're a fucking asshole.  You're dumb.  I love the idea that all the entire endless universe of stars and nebula and everything else  is there so we can look up at night and go, ooh, pretty.  Yeah, that's really nice.  And what do you mean? 
[00:38:30]  Neutron star.  Really?  One tablespoon weighs as much as a mountain?  Well, yeah, God did that for a reason.  It has nothing to do with us.  That's just for us to talk about someday.  Yeah, yeah.  It's for us to chat.  That's what bothers me.  It's how they fucking...  They stick their stupid faces in the sand in the faces of every other bit of evidence.  Science, though, like Danny was saying, science is put there to trick us to test our fate.  See?  Just shit.  Science tests our fate.  Haven't you ever seen contact with Jodie Foster?  Exactly.  That was very good. 
[00:39:00]  But see, that's close-minded, too, because can't God just be the ultimate scientist?  Of course.  I hate when the God people go against the science people.  It's like, why can't you just go, well, God was the ultimate scientist, and we're just  learning what he fucking knows and did.  Well, the same group that...  They've got to keep your mind open.  ...that dunked women to see if they were witches.  Right.  I mean, you really expect logic out of a few hundred...  Those are galaxies.  Those are galaxies.  That's a deep field shot from Hubble?  Right.  That's not just one area? 
[00:39:30]  No.  It's one little piece of the sky.  One little piece.  And those are galaxies.  Those are not stars.  Those are galaxies.  Those are galaxies with billions of suns in them.  In each one.  In each one.  Billions of suns.  Our stupid existence means nothing.  Nothing!  This is just a bunch of fucking horse shit.  We're hurtling through the cosmos.  Just, we're a piece of shit.  But our tiny little brain means nothing.  Nothing.  Our lives mean nothing.  Not a thing. 
[00:40:00]  Maybe, let's just say it did take seven days.  If we all killed ourselves today, it wouldn't mean anything in the end.  No, nothing.  Let's say God did take seven days.  Holy shit.  It's seven days that he forgot about.  It's like an art project you do when you're six.  And you forget about it.  We're a lump of fucking clay.  He's like, let's see how this goes.  And he just moved on.  But then you have to go into the definition of a day.  What was a day back then?  What was a day back then?  Because he didn't invent anything yet.  Well, it's got to be the one rotation of the planet.  Because that's how the Almighty would do it when the planet spins.  One rotation of a fucking, of our planet, by the way. 
[00:40:30]  Sure, yeah, yeah.  Of Earth around the, yeah, spinning around its axis.  Not Jupiter.  Not Jupiter, which spins in ten hours.  No.  Jupiter is Satan's planet.  Yeah.  No, no, it's hours.  Twenty, what a coink-a-dink.  We're very lucky.  A day for him before he even made Earth.  And the sun and everything.  Can we go back to O'Reilly?  Let's start over.  Bill O'Reilly.  Yeah, let's hear O'Reilly.  This is O'Reilly.  Now, are the O'Reilly people going to be mad at us?  Who cares?  The Glenn Beck people are mad at us.  The point, and Ant made it very well, when Glenn Beck first started, okay. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  But something's going on with Glenn Beck.  That's all I'm saying.  Something's happening.  Because these people are coming out of the woodwork.  Like, honestly, the guy, you know, a lot of the stuff he predicted is happening and all that.  But I'm telling you, there's something going on with him.  Look at his eyes.  He's slowly unraveling.  He's losing it.  That's all I'm saying.  I don't know what he was like a year ago, two years ago.  He's unraveling a bit.  Here's Bill O'Reilly and the moon and God.  David Beverly Hills, Florida.  What do you mean when you refer to the tides, when you ask about the existence of God? 
[00:41:30]  Science explains the tides.  The moon's gravity pulls on the ocean.  Okay, how'd the moon get there?  How'd the moon get there?  Look, you pinheads who attacked me for this, you guys are just desperate.  How'd the moon get there?  How'd the sun get there?  How'd it get there?  Can you pause that real quick?  I had to answer them.  Yeah.  Yes, as a result of what we think was the Big Bang and how the same fucking kind of lineup in five billion other galaxies got there. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  That's how it got here, through the Big Bang and probably a collision of some sort.  Cosmic debris.  Cosmic debris.  Cosmic debris coming together based on mass, which is gravity, pulling other debris around it.  And then as things start cooling, spinning, forms spheres, and those things start spinning.  And that's how things get there. 
[00:42:30]  And then other things hit other things, break off chunks.  That makes meteors and satellites around planets that are moons and things.  What do you think?  The sun comes from a chemical reaction.  Hydrogen, helium, nuclear reactions.  That's how it gets there.  It's based on science.  Bill?  Is that a pinhead?  You dolt?  Oh, a magic man put it there.  A magical man.  Yeah.  And he purposely made gravity because his snapping his fingers alone wasn't enough just to keep them there. 
[00:43:00]  Keep us.  So he had to make laws of physics.  Yeah.  Things that can be explained.  Just idiots.  That's a cool one.  I've really had enough.  God, that's what the moon looks like?  No, that's the moon of Saturn, I believe.  Oh, no kidding.  Yeah, it's a big chunk got taken out by him.  Why did God stick that hunk of shit there?  Damn.  Wow, look at that.  Could somebody ask God what the fuck that's doing there?  That moon needs Accutane.  Wow.  Or a bra. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, it's got a tit.  It is a big tit.  That moon's been doing a little too much crystal meth.  Wow.  Those moons get beat up back there.  Somebody explain.  You know, the rear of army, we only see one side of it, but the other side looks just like that.  Pretty beat up.  Beat the fuck up.  Yeah.  Well, there's a reason for people's benefit why God did that.  Like, the rings around Saturn.  God did that so we could look at pretty rings.  Yeah, so we could look through the telescope someday and go like, wow, look at that.  It's got rings around it. 
[00:44:00]  And a meteor's going to hit the Earth eventually.  Probably.  So why isn't God protecting us from that?  Maybe he is.  Why is he going to allow it to happen?  Yeah.  That's the other side.  That's the other side.  What a wreck.  Wow, that side gets beat up a little more than the other side.  And the other side's got these nice fucking planes and everything.  The good side.  I want to check out astronomy, but it just creeps me the fuck out.  Why?  It's pretty cool.  Just because how vast it is and how endless.  The sea of tranquility.  How you can't wrap your fucking brain around it. 
[00:44:30]  It creeps me out.  Always has.  Dark side of the moon is fucked up.  It really is.  It's just a fucked up point.  Here, let's get through this clip.  We never see it, by the way.  How come we have that and Mars doesn't have it?  Venus doesn't have it.  How come?  Why not?  How'd it get here?  How did that little amoeba get here?  Crawl out there.  How'd it do it?  Chemicals.  Come on.  You have order in this universe.  You have an order in the universe.  Tie comes in.  Tie goes out.  Okay, yeah.  The moon does it.  Fine.  How'd the moon get there? 
[00:45:00]  How'd it get here?  Did it just happen?  Six-year-old boy logic.  Okay, if we have existence, if we have life on Earth, how come they don't have it on the  other planets?  They don't have it on the other planets in our solar system, but you're talking about  a fucking speck.  Not even a speck.  Less than a speck.  A nothing.  Our whole fucking universe.  I mean, our galaxy.  The Milky Way galaxy.  Is nothing.  It is a speck of nothingness.  It's an irrelevant fucking dead-end street somewhere in the shitty part of the neighborhood. 
[00:45:30]  Nobody cares about the Milky Way.  And he's trying to make it seem like this is a special thing that God put in place.  The Earth?  Please.  I'm embarrassed that when we were growing up, how many planets?  Eight?  Nine?  Nine.  I always forget.  Nine?  Nine.  Now there's ten.  Now there's ten planets.  Yeah.  There you go.  They found another planet.  But remember, you would make the universe.  Yeah.  The big yellow one's the sun.  Right.  That's all it was, remember? 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  When we were growing up.  They had to adjust all that shit, finally.  No, it's God.  God did it.  And he wants us to listen to the...  Well, obviously in our little area, the Earth is in the right location as far as the sun  goes to fucking support life.  Why?  Why are there life on the other planet?  Because they're a little too far or too close to the fucking big yellow one.  Or too hot.  Right.  And to think that life is just life as we know it is another dumb fucking short...  Life on another planet that's a lot larger, that has heavier gravity, that's further away 
[00:46:30]  from the sun, would have a life form that could take massive amounts of pressure on top  of you, massive gravity, maybe you don't breathe, maybe you live off an ammonia atmosphere that's  absorbed through your skin, through osmosis.  It doesn't have to be what you're doing.  I'm on a planet too.  Hi, everybody.  It doesn't make sense.  Who explained if aliens put a probe in the middle of the desert, that they would go back to their 
[00:47:00]  planet or whatever and go, ah, no life on Earth.  We didn't see it.  If a probe, if you sent a probe to Earth from another planet and it hit the South Pole during  the, I mean, brink of a horrific winter down there when, you know, it's tilted completely  away from the sun, you'd be like, um...  You would go back and say there's no way there could be life on this fucking planet.  There's no way life could live there.  The planet, wow, it's freezing cold, you wouldn't want to go there. 
[00:47:30]  We've taken a couple shots with the probes.  How do we even know we hit the right areas to really know exactly what's going on with  those planets?  But if they hit the South Pole, they'd find water.  That's what we always look for is the possibility of water.  Maybe water's fucking poison for them.  Maybe water is horrible for them.  It's like, oh, this planet has water.  Oh, boy.  There's no way life could exist there.  It's got that water stuff on it.  It'd be like us finding a planet just covered in cum.  That's no good.  Let's invade this delicious planet. 
[00:48:00]  Why isn't anyone living on this delicious planet?  We can use planet Bukkake 2.  Here's the rest of the Bill O'Reilly clip.  Were we just lucky?  Some meteor would do this?  Probably.  You know, I see this stuff.  It's desperate.  Ugh, Bill.  Science is desperate.  Many times.  It takes more faith to not believe and to think that this was all luck.  All this human body, the intricacies of it and everything else, all luck.  No. 
[00:48:30]  Then it does it to believe in a deity.  There you go.  Fine.  We did Santa Claus, too.  How did those presents get there?  Yeah.  Who brought them?  How did they get under the tree?  Who ate that cookie?  Who drank that milk that was on the mantle?  Idiot.  When you reverse engineer human beings, evolution, the earth, everything, it seems like, wow,  that could not possibly happen.  But just the fact that it did happen makes you think that things did fall into place exactly 
[00:49:00]  the way they should have.  If they didn't, we wouldn't be here to talk about it.  How many places missed one fucking thing to make it where life would have formed, and  then it's like, oh, well, life didn't form there.  And that could have happened to this planet.  One thing could have been out of place and not have worked, and this couldn't have happened.  But it did, because the law of averages says it has to.  In an infinite universe, something has to happen. 
[00:49:30]  And let's say there is a God.  Why can't it be that, like, aliens or whatever, another life form came to earth and started  this fucking life?  That's another...  So you're talking about God, that maybe it wasn't even...  Theory.  He didn't even really create us.  He created something that created us.  And they were created by something else and that, and you could backtrack until God isn't  even in the picture, because it's infinite.  I don't have the answers, but...  I don't have them either.  I'm not going to sit here and try to say I do.  To listen to a pompous motherfucker that's talking like he does have the answers? 
[00:50:00]  Right.  That's so pompous.  That's one way of thinking about it, sure.  And he has that right.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's got it right, but he can't sit and call people of science pinheads, and that  it takes more faith to not believe?  It doesn't.  It takes faith in science?  No, science is tangible.  It's something that can grow on you, and you learn more about it. 
[00:50:30]  And people work with previous scientific findings and advanced science.  Religion is this ancient word that you take at face value with nothing but faith, which  again, if that's what you're into, fine, whatever.  But don't make science seem like, oh, you're just being stupid.  You know, fuck you.  I wonder if when he's sick, if he has chest pains or whatever, I wonder if he just says  a quick prayer.  Just pray. 
[00:51:00]  Or if he relies on science.  Like, the odd thing is, this is what bothers me about religious people.  They understand science is here to help us, because most of them, when they break their  leg, they don't just look up at heaven and go, could ye heal me?  Fix thine leg.  They rely on science.  They rely on microbiology and all these things that we all rely on.  But when it comes to the explanation of their being, science is no good.  It's fucking childish six-year-old logic.  It's annoying.  The greatest thing that just proves the horse-shittedness of it all is the dinosaurs being here just a 
[00:51:30]  few thousand years ago.  Who listens to that?  That, to me, is just the dumbest thing I've ever heard.  The picture of Jesus riding a fucking velociraptor or something.  You can't even talk to those people.  It's just fantastic.  How do you talk reasonably to somebody who thinks that 2,000 years ago there were dinosaurs  walking around this planet?  You don't.  There, there, why wouldn't there be a mummified dinosaur? 
[00:52:00]  Why wouldn't somebody in Egypt have taken a dead dinosaur and mummified it like they  did cats, dogs, people, any other fucking animal?  Uh, why isn't there, uh, dinosaur, um, fossils that are newer?  Because we got stuff from 2,000 years ago.  Exactly.  That's a good point.  How come no cave drawings of dinosaurs?  Right.  Um, there were cave drawings because humans weren't around when they were dinosaurs. 
[00:52:30]  So where are the cave drawings of a man hunting, uh, dinosaur?  No, these show them, uh, hunting mammoth.  You see them hunting, uh, saber-toothed tigers, bears, other things, uh, in cave paintings.  Never a dinosaur.  See, I'm going to take that.  I'm going to take that scientific proof research over some idiot like Earl Douglas telling me  that fucking dinosaurs were around when, uh, 5,000 years ago. 
[00:53:00]  No!  No!  How do you explain the woolly mammoth?  The woolly mammoth was an elephant that was chilly and he was wearing a coat.  Yeah.  They're trying to clone a mammoth.  I know.  They found a mammoth, um, frozen in permafrost and, uh, some of his, uh, DNA, some of the  DNA is, uh, recoverable.  So they're going to take that DNA and use an elephant to, uh, run it through its, uh, cycle 
[00:53:30]  and get it to gestate and actually give birth to a woolly mammoth.  That's good.  That's what we should be doing.  Just bringing back things that nature dictated should be dead for 90 million years.  Just a planet of cunts.  Fucking Jurassic Park shit.  Would it be part elephant though?  Uh, I think they would have to use, uh, an elephant.  That at all.  An elephant cell to fertilize, um, the nucleus, uh, once they get the DNA, uh, from the mammoth. 
[00:54:00]  You, you need some kind of fertilization to go on.  So they would use like, uh, an elephant cell, but the basic DNA structure would be from the  mammoth.  Wow.  So you would get like a woolly mammoth.  God, I want to see that.  That'd be cool as shit.  Absolutely.  All right.  I just want to see him doing something, the woolly mammoth, like, uh, doing something  like cleaning or something and have to go, no, it's a living.  See, cause that's what he did on the Flintstones. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  Very good.  I saw woolly mammoth.  I'd probably be like, wait, who bought you that sweater?  Ah, Jim.  Thanks.  Thanks.  The phones are lit.  I want to take, I want to take one because Matty in Rhode Island, he was up all night  freaking about life in the universe and now we're making sense of it.  We're making sense of it.  These are just our dumb thoughts.  What's up, Matty?  Hey, sir.  Matty.  You're on the air.  Rhode Island.  Up all night freaking out about life. 
[00:55:00]  You're on the air.  Is your name Matty?  Maybe he's having a panic attack.  Maybe.  All right.  We'll go to break.  I think the guys, what do you want to do?  The Carl Sagan or the, uh, or the, uh, Brian Regan?  Which Brian Regan?  I think he was going to go, you know, with the, the big yellow.  Ah, I think, I, I like the Carl Sagan, I think.  Let's go Carl Sagan.  Yeah.  I gotta get it back.  All right.  You're going there?  All right.  Carl Sagan.  When we, uh, when we get back, we're going to change gears a little bit. 
[00:55:30]  I want to talk about my Islanders for a minute.  For a minute.  I'm so embarrassed to be an Islanders fan today.  When you, when you, when you thought it couldn't get worse, it got way worse last night.  And I'll explain after the break.  I'm just fucking embarrassed that I follow this team.  And I'm, and a lot of, and well, you should be a lot of fans, uh, agreeing with me today.  Just embarrassed.  I'll explain.  And also a weatherman, uh, had a little slip up.  A faux pas.  It's a great one though.  We got that audio.  Yeah, that's a good one.  And also a little later on in the show, we got Otto from Otto and George coming by. 
[00:56:00]  Dr. Kirk.  And we have, uh, we have Ant's embarrassing tape.  I cannot wait to hear it.  It's in my, it's in my hand today.  I, uh.  It's in my hand.  I predict it's not as bad as Ant's because Ant's a good singer.  I brought it in and, uh, there will be a preface that goes along with this because  I want people to understand that I think more of my life has existed after I recorded 
[00:56:30]  this than before.  That tells you how old this is.  It was recorded and my brother wrote it.  I didn't write it, a motherfucker, but it was recorded in the eighties and you must take  it in the context, please, that it was the eighties.  It was the eighties.  So it was, uh, the influence came from the eighties.  I, I wasn't a fucking seer of what was going to happen in the future of music and you could  play this now and be like, oh, that's a, you know, oh, that's a song, uh, that, you 
[00:57:00]  know, Anthony would do, but to have a, a shock jock and, you know, somebody that people know  me and, and to, to, to, to be singing this drivel, this romantic lovey, please love me  drivel.  Wow.  You sound really embarrassing.  You sound desperate.  Dude, I am going to pull.  That explanation is not going to help at all.  He's so defensive and no one even heard.  I don't even have a first note.  I'm pulling my shirt over my face and will not look at you people.  We haven't heard any of this yet.  We will not look at you people.  No. 
[00:57:30]  All right.  All right.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  It's all right.  Turn it off.  Turn it off before I go.  Go.  Turn it off now.  Now.  Why is it so tinny?  I thought I told you guys to base it up a little bit.  Something slowly.  Gotta have something to amplify.  Did you EQ it?  Yes.  You were actually fucking.  I EQ'd it.  I boosted it like a motherfucker.  Boosted the bottom end.  EQ and extreme queer.  That's what you were.  There was nothing there to boost.  Really?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we'll have the tape.  Something happened slowly, though. 
[00:58:00]  Yes.  We'll have the tape a little later.  Shut up.  Slow is good.  Oh, my God.  I'm so bad.  I have to say one thing.  Twilight was very good.  Oh, you fag.  I'm not enjoying New Moon as much.  I'm halfway through that.  What the fuck?  I like it.  There are vampires that sparkle.  I do like it.  Yeah.  But not as much.  All right.  We'll talk about that after the break, too.  And also, I forgot.  Charlie Sheen's 911 call.  It's terrific.  Oh, that's good.  So we've got lots to do.  So why don't we play this first? 
[00:58:30]  I'm not very good at singing songs, but here's a try.  If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.  Space is filled with a network of wormholes. 
[00:59:00]  You might emerge somewhere else in space.  Somewhere when else in time.  The sky calls to us.  We do not destroy ourselves.  We will one day venture to the stars.  A still more glorious dawn awaits.  Not a sunrise, but a galaxy rose.  A morning filled with 400 billion suns.  The rising of the Milky Way. 
[00:59:30]  The cosmos is full beyond measure.  Elegant truths of exquisite into relationships.  Of the awesome machinery of nature.  I believe our future depends powerfully on how well we understand this cosmos.  In which we float like a boat of dust in the morning sky.  But the brain does much more than just recollect.  It intercompares.  It synthesizes.  It analyzes.  It generates abstractions. 
[01:00:00]  The simplest thought, like the concept of the number one, has an elaborate logical underpinning.  The brain has its own language for testing the structure and consistency of the world.  A still more glorious dawn awaits.  Not a sunrise.  But a galaxy rose.  A morning filled with 400 billion suns.  A rising of the Milky Way.  The sky calls to us.  If we do not destroy ourselves, we will one day venture to the stars. 
[01:00:30]  For thousands of years, people have wondered about the universe.  Did it stretch out forever?  Or was there a limit?  From the big bank to black holes. 
[01:01:00]  Through dark matter to a possible big crunch.  A revenge of the universe today.  It's full of strange sounding ideas.  How lucky we are to live in this time.  The first moment in human history when we are, in fact, visiting other worlds.  A still more glorious dawn awaits.  Not a sunrise.  But a galaxy rose.  A morning filled with 400 billion suns.  The rising of the Milky Way.  A still more glorious dawn awaits. 
[01:01:30]  Not a sunrise.  But a galaxy rose.  A morning filled with 400 billion suns.  The rising of the Milky Way.  The surface of the Earth is the shore of the cosmic ocean.  Recently we've waded a little way up.  And the water seems inviting.  The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:02:00]  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Damn it.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Busy show today.  O.P. and Anthony.  Thanks for checking us out.  Busy show as well tomorrow.  You gotta watch Transdescent.  Transdescent Man.  Am I saying that right?  Trans. 
[01:02:30]  I always.  Transdescent Man.  Transsexual Man, I believe.  Transsexual Man.  Transsexual Man.  Please watch that movie tonight.  Yeah.  Because we're going to have the guy in tomorrow.  I have it in my.  The guy.  My computer bag.  I could watch it on my computer.  Do we have the trailer for Transdescent Man?  Trans.  How do you say that?  Trans.  Transcendent.  Transcendent Man, right?  Transcendent.  Transcendent Man.  Yeah.  I got an advanced copy of this and I really love the movie. 
[01:03:00]  It's a little slow.  I'm not going to lie to you.  But the stuff he talks about in this movie, very fascinating.  We're going to have the guy in tomorrow.  Is the YouTube still fucked up?  Where it's not?  It's fucking taking forever to buffer things?  The reason I'm calling today is to express my disappointment that you have invited this  highly sophisticated crackpot and given him a national forum to express his pseudo-religious predictions that have no basis in objective reality.  If you go back 500 years, not much happened in a century. 
[01:03:30]  Now a lot happens in six months.  Technology feeds on itself and it gets faster and faster.  It's going to continue.  In about 40 years, it's going to be moving so fast.  The pace of change is going to be so astonishingly quick that you won't be able to follow it unless you enhance your own intelligence by merging with the intelligent technology we created.  The board.  This guy is freaky.  He says computers will have consciousness in just 25 years. 
[01:04:00]  As we get to the 2030s, you're not going to be able to tell a clear difference between human and machine intelligence.  The big questions of life is who are we?  What are we going to become?  What's the future like?  And he's got one of the most incredible track records in history for his ability to predict with pretty darn good accuracy.  He's an award-winning scientist and engineer, a millionaire several times over because of his inventions.  These inventions may end up causing the worst war that humanity's ever had. 
[01:04:30]  Corporations and governments and societies will be created and destroyed on the back of the technology that this board describes.  The world is fighting.  The world has gold, I think.  Inventor Ray Kurzweil thinks that one day humans may be able to live forever.  I want to live as long as I can.  I don't want to die.  If following Ray's regimen would put that day off, I'm very willing to do that.  Wow.  I knew there was a reason I was keeping all this stuff, and he kept all this stuff. 
[01:05:00]  I do plan to bring back my father.  Oh, boy.  God is who he is, and our challenge should be to know him, not try to create him.  I'm afraid of you.  It's going to scare a lot of people.  The world is changing far too fast.  Nothing like this has ever happened to Homo sapiens before.  Homo.  These ideas are going to ultimately change the world. 
[01:05:30]  We didn't stay on the ground.  We didn't stay on the planet.  We didn't stay with the limitations of our biology.  I think Ray is performing the service of our prophet.  That's wrong.  He has used the gift that he was given for the betterment of humankind.  That's what I knew.  He sure knows a lot of celebrities.  It will be the universe waking up.  Transcendent Man. 
[01:06:00]  He talks about the universe waking up.  The movie is pretty trippy.  Yeah, I'm going to give that a little watching.  We're going to have Ray Kurzweil in tomorrow.  Of course, I have to watch it after I do Red Eye.  Oh, boy.  But you go out drinking after the Red Eye.  No, I'm going to be cool tonight.  I'm not going to go out.  It makes me feel lousy.  The worst part is that Friday is another workout day. 
[01:06:30]  Right.  So to work out hungover is not fun.  Not fun.  Not fun.  Then just stay away from Andy Levy and you'll be all right tonight.  Well, Andy wasn't even there last time.  Yeah, but he's the troublemaker.  He's the one that says, let's go.  Let's go have a few drinks.  Michaela's a troublemaker.  Yeah.  Let's see.  Who else is?  No, they're all troublemakers.  They're all troublemakers.  Greg, last time we were out, was a troublemaker.  You're not going to be able to say no.  No, I swear. 
[01:07:00]  You have good intentions.  I'm going back to my hotel room and watching Transcendent Man.  Transcendent Man with Ray Kurzweil.  That's what I'm doing.  I might grab a beer out of the minibar.  He's talking about AIs and stuff.  I was telling him before the show, part of this movie, he talks about how he wants to bring back his dead father.  Yeah.  He's obsessed with his dead father because his father died at a very young age, 58, I believe.  And he's got all his stuff and his father was a pack rat.  So what he wants to do is put all the knowledge from his father that he knows and then the stuff that is in all these boxes into some kind of program, whether it's just on a regular computer or some kind of artificial intelligence. 
[01:07:30]  And that's how he's going to bring his father back.  So virtually his father's ideas and likes, dislikes.  Virtually everything he remembers about his father, yeah, will come back to life.  Life in quotes.  It's almost like when Superman went to the Fortress of Solitude and spoke with Marlon Brando and was able to ask him questions. 
[01:08:00]  And then based on what he knew and everything and the program, it was able to give him answers back.  That's kind of what he's thinking.  But he wants to go even further than that where he would have no doubt that this is his father.  Really?  You know what I mean?  But you know what you know.  So it's not far-fetched to put everything you know into some kind of program or some kind of website or something, and that's sort of you online.  How do you put an affinity for drunk driving into a program? 
[01:08:30]  Because I'd like to bring my dad back.  Yeah, this guy needs to let his dad go, and what he's doing is brilliant, but it's like you're not bringing him back.  We need to have a computer program that looks like him.  Just people do die at this point.  But the technology is definitely –  I don't think it's a literal bringing your father back there.  As we know it today, because they even talk about that in the movie, like you've got to start defining what is life and all that.  And he sees a time where you're going to have more than one body.  You're going to have your obviously physical body, but then you're going to have like a virtual body that is pretty serious. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  You know that virtual world with like second life?  Yeah.  They talk to the second life people.  Right now it's kind of primitive, but the technology is going to continue and continue where it's going to start looking way more realistic.  Right.  And then people are going to take that so seriously that they create this other version of themselves online, and that kind of becomes part of what they know.  So what you're saying is, okay, let's say we do – I've always thought we were going to be partial with computers as well. 
[01:09:30]  I think it's a part of evolution.  And just like we were at one point amoebas and slime, and now we're this.  So if you become like, say, part computer and your body breaks down, do you just kind of hang out there in that form, and then the new body comes along and you go in that?  I don't know how that works.  Or do they just regenerate your other body?  I don't know.  I mean you've got to wait for the technology to just keep on growing and stuff.  But there are people right now that care way more about their lives online than in the physical world. 
[01:10:00]  I am.  They camp out in front of their computers, and they're on these games like – I don't know them, to be honest with you, but Second Life certainly.  Yeah, Second Life, EverQuest.  EverQuest and all that.  EverQuest, like all those role-playing games where your characters are built up and have skill levels, and you've created it.  But people have taken it so far that they would rather live in that virtual reality than in the real world.  It's a lot more exciting and a lot more fun.  Yeah, they'd rather spend 12, 16 hours a day doing that than walking around and living life.  By the way, is there a peripheral I could plug into the computer that's a little catapult that could launch a plate of spaghetti against the wall? 
[01:10:30]  Because that would be – that would really bring back dear old dad.  No, you just put a screen on the wall.  Why?  You don't have to go through all that virtual spaghetti on the wall.  And they can put virtual floors, and you'll see little water teardrops from Faggot's face falling.  Yes, Dan.  Maybe you can get that for your Kinect, where you just kind of motion that you're throwing spaghetti against the wall.  Yeah, yeah.  And on the TV, it'll look like you did. 
[01:11:00]  It'll look like spaghetti launch.  That sounds like a great iPad.  Yeah, it's spaghetti launch.  Try to avoid dad's throwing spaghetti at you.  Did he throw it at you?  No, he threw it at the wall.  I think he was going for the phone.  Why?  Mom's special friend calling?  No, no.  Mom's special friend.  I think it was just a good target.  Something to zero in on, you know?  Was he drunk when he did it? 
[01:11:30]  I would gather, yeah, probably.  Who else would throw a plate of spaghetti against the wall?  Somebody with reflux?  Yeah, maybe the sauce wasn't good.  Hey, Mom.  Movie also talks about, you know, I forget, like less than 50 years ago, how computers obviously  completely took over this room.  We all know that.  Yes, filled a room.  And then he explains the ENIAC, the power of that computer compared to the cell phone.  You can't even compare it.  The cell phone, way more powerful than a mere 40, 50 years ago, these computers that took 
[01:12:00]  up way more than one room, actually.  Yeah.  And things continue to get smaller and smaller and smaller.  And then he talked about how, you know, the Google and all that.  The Google.  There'll be some kind of an attachment, whether it's implanted in your brain or you put it  right on the side of your brain.  See, that's the big sticking point right now.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, when you think about the internet and how far you've come in just the  last 15 years, you go, well, where is it going?  I mean, look at the, I mean, look at this guy.  Look at his advancements.  I called that.  I was like, dude, there's going to be internet in your brain, like where you just think about 
[01:12:30]  shit and you get the answers.  But some kind of electrode and then the Google's right there.  I mean, it's going to happen.  Here's the problem.  I think the thing is going to be steps between what we just said and what we have today,  obviously.  But there is a problem because we have the computing power and it's, it goes up leaps  and bounds every fucking year.  It's amazing.  Not even every year.  Like every six months, whatever it is.  Uh, but we've pretty much stuck to the same basic interface between man and computer. 
[01:13:00]  It hasn't changed since the fucking typewriter.  I mean, we're still keying in.  Yeah.  We got touch pads and stuff, but you're still using a virtual keyboard.  But where does it go?  For input.  Technology has to keep advancing.  It's always been this mechanical input to computers.  To put it in your brain where you're actually not, not moving your eyebrows to your, take  the mechanical aspect out of it.  Electrical impulses, your brain controlling the computer. 
[01:13:30]  You really don't have that much control to not put things in or think about certain things.  Like how do you get the self-control and discipline to not put your most horrible secrets online  because you thought about it wrong?  How can you imagine?  Like, like, how do you get that kind of discipline?  Like, don't think about it.  Don't think about it.  Oh, fuck.  I just thought about it.  And now it's out there.  Maybe you can't.  Maybe that's why every report of aliens, is there a certain way there, there, there's 
[01:14:00]  a certain like, uh, dullness to them because maybe that's what you get from that.  Maybe there's a certain neutrality you get.  Oh, where you, you, you, you did learn how to just, or everyone's thoughts are there  anyway.  Right.  So when everyone's thoughts are online and everyone's things are one connect,  it's not as weird because you're seeing everybody naked as opposed to one guy getting  caught doing something.  All right.  And then it kind of balances out because, you know, who knows?  It could take 500 years of having that technology before that's worked out.  That would be pretty embarrassing.  If everyone's walking around naked, it's not embarrassing anymore. 
[01:14:30]  Absolutely.  After a while.  Absolutely.  It really isn't.  He talks about, uh, you know, computers as small as what, um, blood cells.  Oh, really?  And, uh, he goes, that absolutely will happen.  And then you got these little computers in your, in your body and, uh, they're just checking  out your body constantly, making sure everything's cool.  Repairing shit.  Pot, he says repairing shit eventually, but at least, at least monitoring your, your body  from within instead of going to the doctor once a year and getting all your blood work  done. 
[01:15:00]  This thing, he says, this absolutely will happen.  This isn't just in there.  Like on star.  Yeah.  I got my on star.  I can push it up right now.  I can check my tire pressure oil, uh, how much gas I got in the vehicle.  I could set alarms.  I could do that.  It's like that for your body.  You'll, you'll, you'll have like what an iPhone and be able to go.  Uh oh, uh oh, uh, we're seeing some cancer.  Right.  But you're going to see the cancer extremely early on.  You don't want to get that.  You don't want to get the fucking cancer thing on your cancer app. 
[01:15:30]  Cancer fucking.  Especially AT&T because you never get reception.  So you think you are healthy.  You have a tumor on your fucking forehead.  Hey, uh, let me, uh, take a couple of these calls.  Uh, Brian in New York.  Brian.  Brian.  Out in Phoenix, we had 5,000 IT dorks in there.  And he gave the keynote speech and at least 4,000 people walked out.  Why?  He was so.  There was a fire on the plates.  Yeah.  He was on no land. 
[01:16:00]  Ask him about his pills.  He was eating a bowl of pills.  I guess he eats 150 vitamins and supplements a day.  At least.  I think, I think the movie said over 200 a day.  That's crazy.  He's just sitting around popping pills all day long.  He's a bore.  I mean, you know, the movie, it was interesting, but he's not.  He's a little long winded.  Not, not a charismatic speaker.  How long did he talk for?  We probably lasted a half hour and we walked out.  I mean, everyone was just laughing.  They had the Twitters going background and people were tweeting on how dry and pathetic 
[01:16:30]  he was.  But it's amazing though.  It was like a stampede running out.  An IT, if there's an IT group, like you're all, like the all internet nerds and the guy  doesn't have pizzazz when he talks, but he's talking about accurately what's going to happen  in the world and people walk out because he's not a fire, fiery speaker.  What idiots.  Yeah, that is a little.  All he did was talk about like the models that he predicted, you know, he, I did this,  I did that.  But he's not a kook.  He has predicted a lot of shit and he's come up with a lot of inventions that people 
[01:17:00]  take very seriously.  And maybe he's helped, he's helped the blind big time.  That's why Stevie Wonder was in the trailer.  And maybe you have to qualify yourself when you're making predictions about what's going  to happen.  You don't want to come off like Gene Dixon or one of these other assholes.  So maybe you have to qualify yourself with what you've done right and give yourself that  credibility when you talk because you know what you're saying sounds nuts.  Yeah.  You want to be as legitimate as like a Kreskin.  No, there's, there's some guys, there's one guy, I think he's in Hong Kong.  He's working on AIs.  Hong Kong technology. 
[01:17:30]  And he says that whole technology scares the living shit out of him.  Really?  Yeah.  Because, you know, what are we creating and, and how do we control these AIs, these robots  in the end?  How do we actually control them?  Asians are crazy with their robots.  Right.  They really think, they, they think a little too much of the robot.  Yeah.  Robots aren't.  There's a good montage of robots in the movie where I kind of want one.  You know, it's fucked up though.  Robots, the, the most, the most ill conceived, useless robot are ones that are in humanoid 
[01:18:00]  shape.  They, they, they don't make, it doesn't make sense to have one like that.  It's stupid.  It's the, the, the limitations are crazy.  They share, they share what the robots looked at only a mere, whatever, 30 years ago, let's  say 40 years ago.  And now what they're looking like.  And that's what I believe in where the technology just keeps on going.  So it's like, okay, the robots look like this today.  What are they going to look like in 10 years?  And what are they going to be able to do in 10 years?  And some of these guys that are, are in that world, they're like, it scares the shit out 
[01:18:30]  of us where this could go.  The thing that robots do that is amazing.  If you look in an auto plant and see, those are robots that are just doing, painting the  cars.  You ever see the fucking arms just swing around?  There's not one run.  It does the same exact fucking moves every time.  How do they figure that out?  Like that's robotics used for practical purposes.  I'm looking at some Asian robot thing.  And it looks like anything I would see at Disney, animatronics, you know, Hall of Presidents 
[01:19:00]  kind of stuff.  Is that Obama?  Yeah.  He's not the robot.  Oh.  Oh.  The Asian chick.  He's probably humiliated.  He's talking to a robot.  He's talking to a robot.  It's better than talking to a Pelosi.  But I bet you eventually robots will have rights.  Like somebody will assault their robot and because it looks like a person, people will get  upset.  I'm telling you.  You've got to see this movie.  It's like my robot.  Because they discussed that.  When do they become where we have to acknowledge that they're actually...  Robot rights?  Robot rights because they're actually thinking.  When they fall out of a fleshy pussy. 
[01:19:30]  So we're going to have them in tomorrow.  It should be a pretty good discussion tomorrow.  Let me just see really fast.  I want to know about this.  Sherry in Jersey.  Sherry.  Hi.  Hey.  Welcome aboard, Sher.  I bet it would become the R word.  Robot would probably become...  Robot...  Excuse me for one second.  Robot would become offensive.  And you couldn't say...  You'd have to say something like artificial or...  Yes.  It would be some long-winded fucking name. 
[01:20:00]  Alternative life...  Alternative life form.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  You fucking robot...  Yeah.  ...gurr.  Your mother's a robot lover.  Sherry?  There's this novel.  It's a science novel.  It's actually...  It's like a...  It's a teenage novel.  But it's a really good book about...  It's kind of like where they have the internet.  It's called Feed. 
[01:20:30]  And the internet is implanted right in their head.  Yeah.  So they can...  It's just constantly like you can talk to people through your mind and they can...  Yeah, but how do you keep from getting embarrassing thoughts out there?  You know, like, oh, by the way, sorry what I jerked off to last night just slipped out  and now it's all over the internet.  I love your thought.  We'll ask him tomorrow.  The guy's coming here.  Ah, great.  Great Kurzweil.  That's a great question.  Yes.  Because they talk about the future people, whatever they're...  Future people.  They believe this is actually something that will happen in our lifetime. 
[01:21:00]  And we're older.  In our lifetime.  But they get so dependent on it in the book that they keep...  You know, like, even doctors can't speak normal anymore.  They're like, hand me that thingy.  And they just...  Thingy.  It's like so reliant on this feed.  And it's basically the internet inside your head.  It's a really cool book.  I'll take a peek at that.  Thanks, Sherry.  The suspect was described as an electronic American. 
[01:21:30]  Maybe an electronic American.  Jesus.  Fucking robot.  Someone said...  Rachel's learning me to call him a toaster.  Yeah, some fucking toaster cut me off today.  Yeah.  That would be great.  That's like saying...  A toaster.  That's like saying Waterhead, right?  Yeah.  Fuck you, blender.  Leave.  Can I talk about my Islanders for two minutes in?  Yeah.  I know you're not a big hockey fan.  Well, I do like when I...  My team is...  The clip I saw was funny.  Yeah, my team is pretty much...  Well, I think officially the second worst team in hockey. 
[01:22:00]  The Devils are the worst team in hockey right now.  And it's a very embarrassing year for us.  And it's a very tough year.  They don't even have a shot at the playoffs.  And they didn't have a shot at the playoffs two and a half months ago.  Bro-bot.  Bro-bot, yeah.  Bro-bot.  Okay, great.  The Islanders played the Penguins last night.  And even the hardcore fans have followed me on Twitter because they get mad at me.  They're like, yeah, even today, I'm wearing a bag over my head.  This guy Mega Burp on Twitter.  Mega Burp.  Big Islanders fan.  Oh, here's the video right now as we talk.  Oh, yeah.  There you go. 
[01:22:30]  Could you get it up for me?  So, at the end of the game, I guess you don't have to get it up for me because there  it is.  Oh, gosh.  They're showing it everywhere.  One punch.  He's not...  And they're laughing.  See, look.  They're laughing at our goalie, Rick DiPietro, who's just been...  Like, yeah, what a punch.  You fucked him up.  Yeah, Johnson, who's the backup goalie for the Penguins.  I think there was like a minute left in the game and there was...  I love this.  Yeah.  And there was a big fight.  And then Rick DiPietro decides, I got to go fight the other goalie.  He's going to goon it up. 
[01:23:00]  We just were talking about this.  Goalie against goalie.  How mad are you that you're mad at the guy all the way on the other end of the ice?  You can't hear him.  He can't bump into you, but you get so pissed off, you go, I got to go fight that guy  now.  So that's exactly what happened at the end of the game.  DiPietro goes to center ice and this...  I think his name's Johnson, the backup goalie for the Penguins?  Yeah.  He blew his shutout, by the way.  I'll explain in a second.  So they square off at center ice.  Johnson punches him with his left... 
[01:23:30]  His left hand.  He's obviously a righty.  Hits him with his left.  DiPietro literally goes down.  Right down.  Right down.  Glass jaw.  Like a wimp.  And then Johnson is cocked and ready to beat the shit out of him and realizes, like,  I can't punch him anymore.  He had his right hand cocked back, ready to punch him again in the face.  And he just kind of goes like, I already fucked this guy up.  You could see that he felt sorry for him.  Yeah, yeah.  And how lame he was in this fight.  And then they have another angle of DiPietro. 
[01:24:00]  And you could see how petrified and scared the guy is that he's going to get in a fight.  He's not a fighter, eh?  You could see it in his face.  Yeah, he did look pathetic.  And they're showing this fight everywhere.  I tweeted last night, but it's everywhere.  Certainly you can find it.  And then Johnson goes back to the bench and all of his teammates are just laughing.  They're just laughing at him.  Like, ah, dude, they're clapping.  Look at him, high-fiving him.  Look at him.  This little punk.  They're just like, dude, you fucked him up.  Right? 
[01:24:30]  One punch.  Yeah, to pat him on the back.  One punch, he's down.  And then he blew his shutout because that was it.  He had to leave the ice with, I think, how many seconds?  16 seconds left in the game, so officially he doesn't get a shutout.  Because they had to bring in another goalie for the last 16 seconds.  And the goalie fucked up?  Huh?  The other goalie?  No, it was still a shutout.  But technically, you've got to be in the whole game to officially get the shutout on your...  16 seconds he had left?  He hit him with the forearm, but still, it wasn't even a big forearm. 
[01:25:00]  Was it a forearm or did he get him with his fist?  It looks like he hit him with the forearm-elbow combo.  But it didn't seem like it was enough force to knock him down like that.  He goes down.  And then he's right-handed.  He's on top of him with his fist cocked.  And he's like, I can't hit this guy.  I can't fucking hit this guy.  Couldn't bring himself to fucking...  I'm embarrassed.  ...to punch him.  But this team, it's embarrassing.  We pay this guy, I think it was $93 million for 15 years or something.  Not to fight.  I forgot exactly what the total was. 
[01:25:30]  And he's a bust.  Got to stand on his head.  And now he's frustrated, so he wants to go fight.  And he looked like an idiot.  Yeah, he shouldn't ever do that again, by the way, unless he takes some fighting lessons.  Right.  The other clip that's going around today, which is worth playing, is the weather guy from Canada.  Danny knew where it was.  You know where it is, Travis?  No, I will find it, though.  Please do.  Now, in other sports news, do you hear about the Mets and Bernie Madoff?  Yeah.  Madoff fucked up the Mets.  They would have these... 
[01:26:00]  Rupon's got to sell.  These giant...  They'd have these giant contracts for these players.  And the money that they pay the players with, instead of just having it sit, they would invest  it with Bernie Madoff.  Jesus.  And then pay the players.  Right.  With some of the proceeds and make money off of this money that they're paying the players  with, and then it all just disappeared.  I know.  Holy shit.  So are the players getting fucked?  Nah, the fucking...  You know, they got to get paid because it's not...  They didn't fucking invest with Madoff. 
[01:26:30]  Right.  No, so they're trying to sell...  They're still obligated.  They're trying to sell, like, 25% of the team.  Of the team.  Yeah, they're trying to make, like, $100 million.  But who's going to pay $100 million to get 25% of the team?  You don't even have a controlling interest in the team.  What ends up happening in the end?  That's still all up in the air.  Mark Cuban, I saw in the paper today.  I love Mark Cuban.  He's done our show.  Yeah.  That guy knows how to run a sports team.  Of course, the Madoffs guy.  But you wouldn't even get to run...  He said no controlling interest.  But he goes, you know, call me. 
[01:27:00]  He told the Mets, call me.  Yeah, give me a call.  Because what he...  Yeah, but if they're so desperate, couldn't Will Pond sell the majority?  Sure, they could sell 51%.  That's what, like...  He might have to.  There was a story last week that Martin Luther King III wants to buy the Mets.  The fuck does he know about sports?  But he wants to buy...  Maybe he does know about sports.  I have a dream today that the Mets will make the playoffs.  I've seen the mountain top.  Yeah, do you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That a team will not be judged by the color of their uniforms, but by the content of their 
[01:27:30]  batting average.  And by ripping off my father.  Ooh, ooh.  What a surprise.  I'm wrong again.  Let me go to Mitch and White Plains so we get the real...  Mitch!  The real info.  Go ahead, Mitch.  Oh, hey, guys.  How you doing today?  Listen, DiPietro lost his shit yesterday.  I don't know what the fuck was wrong with him.  He just takes a Ron Hextall type swipe to one of the players, and that was the result  of the fight, because they had to put him in his place.  Yeah, I saw that.  I saw he kind of took a cheap shot. 
[01:28:00]  And then who...  Did Johnson come out of goal first and say, we're doing this?  Yeah, basically.  He said, what are you, what are you, stupid?  Right.  He just put him in his place.  Hockey's weird, because they only let goalies fight other goalies most of the time.  Yeah, well, he totally deserved the asshole, but he's a punk.  He took all the out on his money, and he just needs to go somewhere and die.  Yeah, fucking DP is just an unbelievable disappointment.  I have a team!  I have a team today! 
[01:28:30]  15 years, $67.5 million.  Deal signed four years ago, so we're stuck with this guy for another 11 fucking years.  Free agents at last!  Free agents at last!  Thank God almighty, free agents at last!  I can't get off the Martin Luther King Jr. thing.  It's a good one, though.  It sounds like him.  I like that he's...  Heather?  I like that he wants to buy the Mets.  Heather?  Yep.  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah, basically what that guy said, I got so excited when I saw that. 
[01:29:00]  That was my favorite NHL moment of the year, I think.  I'm from Pittsburgh.  I'm a huge Penns fan, and I thought of you immediately, Opie, so...  I can't even, I can't even beat you, I can't even, like, fight you on this.  It's embarrassing.  Oh, man.  Everyone's laughing at DPA show today, and the Islanders in general.  That was embarrassing.  Thanks.  Plus, they have an ad.  They're putting some dumb package together for... 
[01:29:30]  Oh, you saw that, too?  Oh, yeah.  I'll give this to Anthony.  He'll laugh.  Jimmy will laugh at this one, too.  They're doing a Valentine's Day thing to get people to the Coliseum.  Oh, no.  So, it's talking about love, Valentine's Day, hockey, you know, and then...  Gold-covered roses?  Gold-covered roses.  And then, in the ad, it says, end roughing.  Oh, really?  End roughing, or something like that.  Oh.  Like...  What does that mean?  Like, they're not even thinking over it.  No.  So, everyone's talking about this ad, like, what the fuck is wrong with the Islanders?  What does it mean?  Are they into, uh... 
[01:30:00]  What, domestic violence?  Domestic violence?  Look at that.  Well, a few of them have happened.  This February, give her flowers, chocolate, and two minutes for roughing.  Oh, that's good.  Who thought that up?  Potvin?  Right.  Hey, see, you know the Islanders.  Oh, I know the old school fucking...  Yeah.  I love the chant, beat your wife, Potvin, beat your wife...  And two minutes for roughing.  What the fuck are they thinking?  That's crazy.  So, can we go to the weather video?  And then we're talking about videos.  We got this. 
[01:30:30]  Let's turn back to Cronwall.  Scores!  What the hell is that?  Oh!  I don't know.  It sounded exciting.  It sounded like hockey.  It sure did.  Exciting sounding when they score.  Weatherman.  So, thanks for joining us.  Grab a hot cock...  Cock...  Uh...  Cock...  Of cocoa...  As well as...  Put that back.  Put that back.  I gotta get that again.  Cock...  Uh...  Cock...  We will play out the entire store.  So, thanks for joining us.  Grab a hot cock...  Cock... 
[01:31:00]  Uh...  Cock...  Of cocoa.  As well as...  No one fucks that up unless you love the cock.  Grab a hot cock.  Grab a hot cock.  And then he tried to change it to cocktail.  But that doesn't work either.  He was going...  Then he went with cocoa.  Cock...  Coke...  Yeah.  We will play out the entire store.  So, thanks for joining us.  Grab a hot cock...  Cock...  Uh...  Cock...  Of cocoa...  Of cum...  Of cock...  Coco...  Whoops. 
[01:31:30]  Wow, man.  Isn't that great?  A hot cock...  What does he say after that?  That, uh...  Uh...  He was going cocktail or cocoa, but he said a cup...  Cock...  A cup of cocoa.  He was all over the boat.  Is that what he said?  So, thanks for joining us.  Grab a hot cock...  Cock...  Uh...  Cup...  Of cocoa...  Oh, my God.  As well as, uh...  Bring your, uh...  Computer...  Your balls...  On Twitter...  Say, that's because his, uh...  Computer was in his brain.  Yeah, say...  Getting back to your thought...  See...  See...  That would have been like, ah, I said hot cock... 
[01:32:00]  Oh, well...  No one makes a Freudian slip like that...  Unless you love the hot cock...  That's...  I mean, I'm just...  I think I would have to agree with you.  I've never fucked up like that...  And he couldn't even get out of it.  He was stuck with the hot cock...  He was like, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not...  He couldn't get hot cock out of his mouth.  All right.  One more time.  We're going to break.  Oh, please.  For the Maritimes, we will play out the entire story.  So, thanks for joining us.  Grab a hot cock...  Cock... 
[01:32:30]  Uh...  Cup...  Of cocoa...  As well as, uh...  Bring your, uh...  Computer, your laptop...  Whoops.  On Twitter.  The O.V. and Anthony Show.  O.V. and Anthony.  O.V. and Anthony.  O.V. and Sirius XM.  The O.V. and Anthony Show.  Before we move on from the goalie, uh, fight we just talked about, Rick DiPietro from the  Islanders looking like, uh, I don't know.  Ah, puss-ah.  All right, you said it.  Uh, me and Ann went old school during the, uh, break talking about Billy Smith. 
[01:33:00]  Billy Smith.  Even Anthony remembers Billy Smith.  You gotta go way back.  You gotta be a hardcore Islanders fan that goes way the fuck back.  Those are the wonder years of the Islanders.  We're talking the 80s, and, uh, Billy Smith would never have gotten punked out at center  ice like that.  Never.  He would swing at you.  He was a dirty motherfucker.  Near his crease.  Yeah.  He would fucking, like, take his stick and fucking whip it at your legs.  Right.  At your head.  About a month ago, I was trying to look up some old Billy Smith clips on YouTube, and, 
[01:33:30]  ah, it's lacking.  Didn't quite have the cameras.  Because, like you said, these guys go across his crease.  He would take his stick and just fucking, like they're doing to the Egyptians?  Yeah.  That's what Billy Smith did to anyone that was close to his, uh, crease.  He, he, he was not scared of anyone.  He fought all the fucking time.  Yeah.  And he was a, he was a dirty, dirty player, and we loved him.  Great damn goalie.  Where's his car dealership now?  Yeah.  No kidding.  All those hockey players.  No kidding.  Yeah, Stanley Cup champ, few years running, uh, and, and, how many Stanley Cups did, uh, 
[01:34:00]  Billy Smith, was he won?  He won them all with the Islanders.  He was all with the Islanders, right?  Oh, sure.  Yeah.  He won them all.  Um, and when I was, when I was a kid, I used to caddy at the Huntington Crescent Club,  and this is a true story.  Clark Gillies was a member, and, uh, and Billy Smith was a member, matter of fact.  And, uh, I remember in between, I think it was when they were playing the Kings in the  Stanley Cup, I think.  I might be wrong about the team at this point.  But, and they had an off day, and, and both teams came up to the Huntington Crescent Club.  It's the Stanley Cup Finals. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  And they have a day off, so they're like, hey, you guys want to play some golf?  And Billy Smith, it's a day off.  He just, I, I got the caddy for him that day, just pounding fucking beers.  And I'm sitting there as a little kid going, I want to believe in this shit, that, that  they're taking this really seriously.  And just mellowing out on a day off.  Well, it worked.  But he was, he was just fucking slamming back beers, playing golf, and then, and then the  next day he was back in goal.  Yeah.  Ah, the good old days.  He was an animal, man.  He was a fucking animal.  I'm Billy Smith. 
[01:35:00]  I want four Stanley Cups.  And look at this cup holder in this 92 Toyota Celica.  How much money could he have possibly made?  What are you doing?  Four Stanley Cups and no money.  Yeah.  Probably no money.  I'm sure the old days like that, it was just for the glory.  I would love to know what he was making in his heyday.  If you could look that up somehow, Danny, that would be, because DPHO makes.  Yeah, yeah.  How many millions?  Holy shit money.  And he looks, oh, Christ.  And Smith was constantly standing on his head. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, yeah.  Standing on his head.  He sure was.  Hey, there was one more thing I wanted to play from the Weather Channel.  News reporter flips out because there's a, there's thunder in a snowstorm.  Did you hear this one, Ant?  What was that?  I did not.  Okay.  It's quick.  Guy loses his mind because that's the thing to do if you, if you're a weather guy at this  point.  I heard it was a bus spin out plus cars or, or, uh, oh, listen to that.  Son of a.  That scared me. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  I was like, what was that?  I guess I got to give it to that guy.  I wanted to beat him up, but holy shit, that was Armageddon.  That scared the fuck out of me.  Yeah, you're right.  Whoa.  I heard it was a bus spin out plus cars or, or, uh, oh, listen to that.  Son of a.  That's unbelievable.  Oh my goodness.  I love this guy.  Holy smoke. 
[01:36:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  Holy shit.  Holy smoke doesn't work.  I'm sorry.  He wanted to say son of a bitch and holy shit and like, fuck.  And mommy, get me the fuck out of here.  Holy smoke.  Say smoke.  Just incredible.  Robbie.  Twice in one storm, baby.  Holy smoke.  This guy has meteorology in his veins. 
[01:37:00]  He loves the weather.  He's a storm chaser.  Storm chaser.  Finger of God.  It's already here.  Holy smoke.  Look, I know we have this discussion from time to time, but, but you got to start believing  in global warming.  There's some shit going on.  Come on.  Are you starting to believe a little bit?  Well, this last storm covered 33 states.  And did you see the cyclone that is hitting Australia?  That is the size of the United States.  See it. 
[01:37:30]  They named it after me, my friend.  It's called what?  I believe it is.  Cyclone.  Alcohol.  It is an A.  Is it really Anthony?  I think it's Cyclone Anthony.  Wow.  I believe it's Cyclone Anthony.  Oh, wow.  Did you see the size of this thing?  When you look at, know how big Australia is, and you see the satellite, the satellite video  of this thing coming in, it is so fucking big.  Cyclone Anthony, it's only going to smash into guardrails. 
[01:38:00]  I'm sorry, Ann.  I know that car actually was traumatic.  But the Aborigines better run.  It's only going after.  Very good.  It's only going after teenage girls.  Oh, that too.  Oh, it's easy.  It's all.  What's the edge of consent in Australia?  Aboriginianese.  Aboriginianese.  You've got to see the sizes.  Cyclone Yossi?  It's Yossi, not Anthony?  What happened to Cyclone Anthony?  They gave up on Anthony.  Wait, wait.  Cyclone Anthony.  How did they get to Y already?  No, maybe the Anthony is the next one. 
[01:38:30]  X, Y, Z.  A.  A.  Right?  Where's Cyclone Anthony?  It doesn't even come up.  I swear.  Expect it to.  Australia's getting their share of shit, huh?  Emergency.  What does it say?  Moisture from tropical Cyclone Anthony is also expected to contribute to Victorian storms.  Thieves strike as Cyclone Anthony hits.  Cyclone Anthony hit Queensland last night. 
[01:39:00]  This is two days ago.  Two days ago.  I saw a cyclone that'll hit that tanker.  What?  What?  Oh, okay.  My mistake.  I got my Australian cyclones mixed up.  You know, two days ago it was my name.  It's Cyclone Yossi.  Yeah, there are a lot of people saying that.  Yossi.  Don't they do alphabetical order?  Or do they have to go back around?  Maybe they're going back.  Y, Z.  Their water goes the other way.  Maybe their cyclones go the other way.  A.  Maybe they go A and then they go ZY. 
[01:39:30]  No, it would have been A if it's Anthony.  Then it would have to go through B, C, D.  No, but maybe they do it backwards.  Oh, they're going backwards.  Because it is Australia.  They do everything a little different there.  I don't believe it.  I don't believe it.  I was going to move on, but someone said it.  And I heard that too, and I want to play it again.  This guy, the other black listener from Columbia writes, he paused before the first one.  Is it fake?  And I did hear that.  What?  The weather guy.  Did he?  He paused before the first one.  Wait, maybe he saw the lightning. 
[01:40:00]  It's lightning, right?  Yeah, you see a big bright flash.  And if it's right upon you, obviously the lightning and the actual sound would be very quick.  Listen, though.  I heard it was a bus spin out, plus cars are...  Oh!  Listen to that!  That's right.  He saw the lightning.  Yeah, he saw that lightning.  Which was right there, right?  Okay.  You know what lightning is the best?  When it's really close and you hear it actually go...  Like, that is the best fucking sound lightning. 
[01:40:30]  It's the best when you're inside looking out a window.  Yeah.  That's when it's the best.  A big bright blue flash and then a split second later, there's an explosion outside.  That is some fucked up shit.  Did I ever tell you this story?  It's fun.  It gives you this primal fear thing almost.  You're not afraid of it, but it's like, it's definitely a primal feeling.  You're not afraid of it?  No, it's exciting.  When you're outside, get the fuck out.  You start counting.  It's like this exciting thing that happens. 
[01:41:00]  You start counting, like, okay, that's far away.  Is it coming closer?  But it's so primal.  It's like an instinctual thing.  And we don't have many instincts that really kind of hit you like that, you know?  It's so old.  Did I ever tell you the story of the Vietnamese kid on the golf course?  My friend?  I was going to say his real name, but maybe I shouldn't.  Sounds like a set-up for a joke.  Yeah.  So there's a Vietnamese kid.  He's on a golf course.  Is he running naked with napalm on him?  Well, we're all old enough where we remember when they brought in the Koreans and the Vietnamese  with their little Vietnamese to English fucking translation books. 
[01:41:30]  And then I became friends with one Korean and one Vietnamese kid.  Yeah.  And by the end of high school, they were smarter than me.  What the fuck?  They didn't even know the language when they started.  How the fuck does that happen?  Did you congratulate him?  I pat him on the back and call him a gook and he punched you?  It's inappropriate, Opie.  I didn't know better.  I was very isolated as a child because my mommy, she was scared of everything.  So I had to stay home a lot. 
[01:42:00]  But he became a caddy at the same place, the Huntington Crescent Club.  Caddy.  And we used to have to caddy through these thunderstorms all the fucking time, man.  You didn't get to go inside.  You try to find cover out there.  I don't think the heavy stuff's going to come down for quite some time.  And this story is true.  I wish someone out there, who knows, maybe they're listening, they could call and back me up.  So this Vietnamese kid, I want to say his real name, but thunderstorm, he decides, all right,  I'm going to fucking go into that big fucking tree, right?  Oh, boy.  Dude, I swear to you, the lightning hit the fucking tree while he was under it or close to under it, 
[01:42:30]  split the fucking thing right in half and the thing fell.  That's how close he was to getting hit by lightning.  Wow.  Look at that one.  There's a bolt of lightning hitting the Luxor.  In Vegas.  In Vegas.  Could you imagine?  Top of the pyramid of the Luxor.  I wonder if he'd shit his pants.  I never asked him.  Oh, I have to.  You would have to shit your pants if you have a little doody inside.  Oh, my God.  God, I just, sometimes you just want to feel like you're in love. 
[01:43:00]  You are an asshole.  Oh, you ready?  I thought we were waiting for Otto.  Oh, you're waiting for Otto?  Yeah, it might be better.  Just have more people in the room.  Okay.  Oh, God.  I don't want to make fun of it, though.  I actually just want to enjoy it.  No, you don't.  Jimmy's referring to Ant's most embarrassing take that he finally brought in.  I brought it in today.  Finally, Joe Curry dropped it off.  He was a courier.  He was a courier last night.  Joe Currier.  He brought it over.  It was on cassette tape, and he had to put it on a CD. 
[01:43:30]  The sound quality, not up to par.  I'm a little disappointed.  I would have liked a little lower end on there, a little of Mike Klotz's bass guitar, but it's not quite.  We could try some more stuff if you want.  If there's going to be some time.  Do you want to try a little bit?  Boost the bottom end.  Is Derek here?  Not that I don't, you know.  All right, fuck you.  No, I want someone else to do it.  But D-Boy does know his shit when it comes to mixing.  Ant is implying that you've bundled it enough.  Mix master D-Boy. 
[01:44:00]  Is he trying to say that I nagled this up?  No, never nagled it.  There you go.  Maybe D-Boy can boost that bottom end a little.  All right.  A little bass.  D-Boy can do it.  We also have Nervous Oscar in here.  We want to give him five minutes on the radio today.  Is he around?  Yes, D-Boy.  He's in here.  Do me justice.  Little bottom end there, D-Boy.  Little bottom end.  We also have Charlie Sheen's 911 call we've got to get to.  And really quickly, what do you think of Bloomberg's smoking ban? 
[01:44:30]  That's big news today.  Again, Bloomberg shoving his face in everyone's business.  Even at this point, even when Bloomberg has an idea that I'm like, all right, that's reasonable.  I hate it because it's just more government intervention in our lives.  And that part, I don't like at all.  You can't smoke in par.  I could see in certain places, I like that there's no smoking, but you can't smoke in pedestrian malls.  You can't smoke in Times Square now.  You know Times Square? 
[01:45:00]  Yeah, you can't smoke.  You can't smoke in beaches and parks.  That's ridiculous.  Beaches and parks.  There's an arrogance that comes with that.  Like, I understand health issues, but that's a fucking we-know-better-than-you arrogance.  Yeah.  I think it goes deeper.  I think it's another way to get fucking revenue coming in.  Yeah, of course.  Because he knows people are addicted to cigarettes, and they're going to take their chances.  And now, guess what?  Here's your $200 fine for smoking at a beach.  It's about the money.  It's always about the money.  Well, they want people to leave.  They're trying to take care of the individual. 
[01:45:30]  I don't believe that for a second.  They want people to quit, but that's because it will save the money.  I mean, the insurance will be, and the health costs will be a lot lower the more people that quit.  True.  But as long as they continue smoking, we might as well make a little more money off of that.  I don't know.  It's like, how do you bar people from smoking in Times Square?  Because he's a fucking rich, fucking simp baby.  Yeah.  Why do you put potted plants when fucking people have to drive you, fucking panty waste?  Let's take the crossroads of the world and take one of the roads and just make it with potted plants where people can walk. 
[01:46:00]  And so everyone knows you're listening to three guys that don't smoke.  No.  We don't smoke.  No.  And I hate smokers.  I hate going into the restaurants and bars when it was all smoky, but I always thought it was ridiculous that they forced bar owners and restaurant owners to fucking stop the smoking.  I really did.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I hate.  I hate.  And now it's to a point where you can't smoke at a beach.  I've never been affected by someone smoking at a beach or a park.  Maybe get a quick whiff or something for maybe a split second, but you never thought that that might be harming you. 
[01:46:30]  How are we supposed to be able to identify the girls that really don't want to take care of themselves and have low self-esteem?  Smoking girls will always fuck faster than non-smoking girls.  You're going to be in trouble.  Oh, I know.  You can't just see a daddy issue.  You got to see the signs.  You need the first physical sign, that butt hanging out of their mouth, that fucking cigarette hanging out like Muggsy.  That's really funny.  That's really funny, man. 
[01:47:00]  And if you want to get into this, I mean, he's banning it in New York, but what about the exhaust from the cars?  That is way more hazardous to your health than a dumb guy smoking a cigarette in Times Square somewhere.  It's ridiculous.  It truly is.  He's full of shit.  He's just like, like Jimmy said, a rich, arrogant baby.  He has nothing better to do.  He's he loves power.  This guy loves having power over his minions. 
[01:47:30]  So what he does is he just keeps enacting these laws and and rules and regulations.  Yeah, he's he's going to dictate and regulate the way you live your life.  Yeah.  I don't care that he has a fucking R in front of him.  He's a flaming liberal.  Well, he just could not get on the fucking Democratic ticket.  He's an embarrassment.  He's a prick.  He wants to take your salt away and your sodas away.  Sodas.  And I tax him.  You can't do that.  You can't do that.  There's taxing health. 
[01:48:00]  That's not going to make people stop fucking eating salt.  And by the way, was that really the intent of taxation in this country?  Was that really the intent where they said, hey, we need your tax dollars.  If you want to live in this country, you got to pay a certain amount of money so we can  keep the infrastructure going.  Do you think they really meant, hey, by the way, that isn't good for you.  We're going to tax that.  It's ridiculous.  You can't do it that way.  It's taxation without representation. 
[01:48:30]  Hate to admit, but, you know, the Obama thing, too, you can't force people to get health  insurance.  You can't make a law that says you have to get health insurance or you'll be taxed.  Sure.  You can't do that to the people.  Then again, the people are going to, in a way, you're probably right.  But what bothers me is then people are going to go, well, you got to take care of me when  I'm sick.  Like if those people who refuse to get it are willing to fucking either pay for it or  go fuck yourself, you're not getting the surgery, you're not getting emergency room.  It's a weird, it's a weird balance. 
[01:49:00]  There's a gray area there.  Because they know they're going to be taken care of.  Yeah.  It's like that, I mean, you know, I don't know.  It's like that fireplace, firehouse that wouldn't put out that fire because the guy didn't pay  his bill.  The thing is, that still tries me.  It was deemed unconstitutional because you can't force people to do something under the  threat of taxation.  You just can't do it.  It's, I don't know who thought that was a great idea. 
[01:49:30]  I don't like any of these taxes where they're forcing you to do or not do something or you  will be taxed for it.  Yeah, I agree.  It's supposed to be, all right, you're taxed on your income, you're taxed when you buy  something, you're taxed enough.  Leave us the fuck alone for a second.  For fuck's sake, cut your budgets.  Even, and I, believe me, I don't, I'm not a fan of Cuomo, but.  You hear what he did with the MTA?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, you did hear.  Yeah.  I'm like, holy, bow fucking down.  What did he do? 
[01:50:00]  Cut their budget by a hundred million.  Cut their budget, a hundred million.  Good.  A hundred million.  Now deal with it, motherfuckers.  Holy shit, that's a big move.  I like that he's cutting the budget like a motherfucker.  Aren't they going to raise prices?  They probably will.  They probably will.  You know, I still go with the fact that I think they have plenty of money.  They're just spending it poorly.  That's what they're doing.  But now Cuomo, you know, inherited all this shit.  And he's like, fuck that.  And I'm cutting the MTA's budget by a hundred million.  Wow.  Yeah.  And Cuomo's pissing off Bloomberg, which is great.  Is he?  Yeah.  He's pissing off everybody. 
[01:50:30]  The unions, Bloomberg, which is good.  If a politician is getting everyone mad at him, he's doing a good job.  That's what I, that's absolutely how I feel.  He's sticking to his own guns.  Fuck the polls.  Fuck this.  I think this is a good idea.  And that's what I'm doing.  Yeah.  I like it.  He's all business too.  He doesn't have a party for himself or nothing.  As long as he's not, I know.  He seems to be a weirdo, man.  He seems to be just all business to the point he's got to be a drag.  As long as he's not as fucking, with this welfare crap that his father was into. 
[01:51:00]  Mario, Mario, Mario.  I was into me.  Oscar, Oscar came by to do something for the show, but we saw him wander in the hall.  So we figured, what the hell, have him come in for a few minutes.  What's up, Oscar?  Nervous Oscar.  How are you?  How's everybody doing?  What are you doing here?  Oh, I was just stopped by.  Sam called me up yesterday.  He wanted to stop by and help me on a couple things.  Yeah.  I already helped Iraq.  I was licking some envelopes. 
[01:51:30]  So now the, you know, Y-Stickers.  So he was like, here, lick this.  And I licked it.  Tastes like shit.  He's making flavor.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Then Iraq would have done it himself.  Yeah, no.  Well, he did the heathen ones.  Pizza flavor.  You're an inventor.  Why don't you patent that idea?  It's not really, it's not a bad idea because I got, I got a lot of envelopes to lick myself  for something coming up.  And yeah, why not fucking flavor this shit?  I got the peel off adhesive ones and I got to deal with that licking shit.  You know, those are the best.  I actually got to do the rag thing. 
[01:52:00]  The future.  Oh, that.  Yeah.  You take a little sponge.  And just sponge them down.  Spongy.  You're looking for something else.  Oscar, we want to give you, we want to give you, we want to give you five minutes.  Oh, five minutes.  There's a lot going on in the world.  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Man, it's scary.  I mean, now when everybody's saying, hey, what's going to happen next year, you know,  with all the predictions and what's going to happen with the Mayan almanac calendar.  So yeah, it's scary.  Well, I'm talking about, because, you know, you look at the weather, you look at, you know, 
[01:52:30]  geopolitical turmoil, you're looking at freaking way freaking the gas  prices and, well, it's because I commute, so that's why gas prices affect me a lot.  And I spend like 60 bucks on gas, like on a freaking daily basis.  Yeah.  So yeah, I have to buy a smaller car, maybe switch order, like some sort of, what do  you call it, hybrid?  Or maybe go, yeah, hybrid or electric power.  Looking at the vault, you know, the Chevrolet vault.  Yeah.  It's good.  I mean, it's like, what, 41,000 or something.  I don't know if you can lease it.  I don't know. 
[01:53:00]  Maybe I stop at our dealership and be like, hey, what's up, guys?  And what do you plug it into your house?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hell yeah.  I have a couple of plugs there in the garage.  Oh, hey.  Yeah, you just plug it in.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Yeah, but hey, remember where, you know, that electricity's coming from.  Mommy and daddy.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  That's why it works for him.  You don't give a fuck.  Oh, no, no.  I, you know, I pay bills in the house.  So yeah.  No, I was saying, I was, I was starting out talking about the, the plants, you know,  where they burnt coal and all that stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's still not, it's still filthy business, huh?  Do you think with this vault, he, he brought up something I actually wanted to talk about 
[01:53:30]  with the vault.  Yeah.  Do you think you're going to see a lot of, um, uh, electric receptacles being locked  and hidden and shit?  Cause if you go behind certain stores and things, there are just receptacles on the  wall that no one really uses, but now it would be like free gas with the heavy, with  the heavy metal covers.  Yeah.  And you just pull up now, you have an extension cord with you, you plug it in, you just hang  out and charge your fucking car free electric bill. 
[01:54:00]  It'll probably be computerized.  And in order to use it, your, your database has to register that this is your car and then  they'll just charge you.  But at, but at first they're going to have to change, they're going to have to change  all that.  Just an open outlet.  I wonder, just an open fucking outlet.  Yeah.  You could just plug your car in to a regular outlet and, uh, take people's electricity.  You know, your neighbor goes to work.  Exactly.  Wait for him to leave and then fucking pull up.  He leaves, you run an extension cord from his outdoor thing.  Run up his driveway.  Right.  You run it to your car and then you fucking, you know, give it the old pull, pull the fucking 
[01:54:30]  extension cord out of the wall and wrap your cord up and, uh, you're, you're all fueled  up.  He is like siphoning, but not, I mean, less dirty.  Yeah.  What else going on?  So you're getting a vault.  What about, uh, Egypt?  What about, um, I don't know what else?  Like Charlie Sheen, Egypt.  What's going on?  What do you think?  Oh, well, it's, uh, I mean, what I think is a lot of people on the streets, I got them,  how are you going to pay your rent?  So you should be working or something.  I mean, that's what I think.  Well, that's, see, you see, uh, that's part of the problem.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  There's rampant unemployment. 
[01:55:00]  Oh.  Um, and, uh, the wages, I think, I think they make, I think the average person in Egypt  makes $1,800 a year.  Oh, wow.  What?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's, it's crazy.  Poverty.  Crazy poverty.  Uh, they got rich people too.  Yeah.  Then they got, yeah.  The disparity.  It's one of those things.  The disparity is giant.  There's, there's, you know, the Royal family pretty much who's in charge with Mubarak and  his cronies.  They try to say how romantic like Egypt is and Cairo and all that. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  But I've heard nothing but watch your back when you're checking out the pyramids because there  are so many poor people.  Yeah.  They, and they want money and good.  Constantly.  And riches.  Yeah.  I didn't know it was $1,800 per person.  Yeah.  Like two bucks a day or something.  I heard this Japanese show that they have like a frigging pizza hut and a McDonald's  right across from one of the monuments there.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's stupid.  Yeah.  I was watching an interview with the, the CEO of, um, Yum. 
[01:56:00]  They're Yum.  That's their company.  They own a pizza hut and all the KFCs and shit.  And, uh, it was odd to see like a pizza hut and then a tank in front of it.  It's kind of cool.  It was weird.  It was odd.  You know, you see something so nice and recognizable and Western and, uh, then you just see a big  tank in front of it.  Uh, a little creepy, but, uh, yeah.  So, you know, that's why they're not working.  Oh, okay.  Well, yeah.  And they should offer, um, a good, you know, um, start building shit.  You know, like just in Dubai, like they had, uh, uh, the, uh, Burj Khalifa, you know, build 
[01:56:30]  that, the big tower.  Yeah.  Start building shit.  So, where does that money come from to build shit?  Uh, oil.  They don't have a lot of oil.  Oh, okay.  See, Egypt, it's a misconception that Egypt has oil.  They don't have a lot of oil.  They got the canal.  They have the road that all the oil has got to go through, the Suez Canal.  Um, but their, uh, their, uh, gross national product is, um, probably that of like Louisiana.  Oh.  The entire country of Egypt is, makes the same amount of money a year as Louisiana or, or, 
[01:57:00]  you know, some shit Southern state, Arkansas, you know, no offense to the people down there,  but your states are shit.  Oh, I'm just saying.  I guess the Egypt should turn to tourism then.  You know what I'm saying?  Well, that's their big thing.  Okay, all right.  Tourism.  They can't turn to that if they already have that.  Oh, okay.  Well, clean the streets.  They only have so much stuff you can look at.  Clean the streets.  Yeah, clean up the, you know, the shit that's going on.  It's like, fuck, a lot of people. 
[01:57:30]  Uh, Anthony, he says clean the streets.  Uh, Jordan from Scranton writes, fuck, I just lost money.  I bet a friend of mine $50 that Oscar wouldn't say the phrase geopolitical turmoil today.  Oh, fuck.  Ah, you lost the vet.  Sorry, Jordan.  Oh, damn.  Um, so whose side are you on, Oscar?  Oh, on the American side?  No, I mean the Mubarak thing.  Are you from?  Oh, oh.  Oh, well, this is the thing, man.  I wouldn't be able to say something, like, solid, because, I mean, I don't live out there.  But, I mean, if, you know, give the people what they want. 
[01:58:00]  Absolutely.  If they want jobs, they want good education, and they want good health, then absolutely give to them.  I mean, if it's, you have to crack a couple eggs, then might as well do it.  You know what I'm saying?  Crack a couple of eggs?  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, if you want...  What does that mean?  What do you mean by that?  If you want breakfast.  I don't know.  It's like an old Irish saying, no?  Well, how does it go?  Oh, I don't know.  If you want scrambled eggs, I'm going to crack a couple shells or something.  I don't know.  I probably screw that one up.  You ever hear the old Irish expression, you're an idiot?  Oh, no, of course.  I'm just used to that one. 
[01:58:30]  Anyway.  His ideas are fairy tales.  Yeah.  It's not easy just to give everyone jobs and health care and all that.  No, that's true.  Brainiac of the month.  A Connecticut man accidentally dials 911 while threatening to kill somebody.  Oh, that's good.  That might be the worst time to accidentally dial 911.  Oops.  Oscar, we talked about this earlier in the show.  Would you be one of the protesters right in that square there?  Would you be one of those brave enough guys to fight for the cause and maybe die for the cause? 
[01:59:00]  I said, honestly, that I would check it out on the outskirts where I would kind of hear the shit going on sort of in the background.  Where would you be in that square?  Actually, I would be in the silence just throwing rocks from there and just like, oh, just throw it and just look to the side there.  You know what I'm saying?  Where would you throw the rocks?  You would be sneaky rock thrower?  Yes, that's right.  Sneaky rock throwing guy.  Yeah, that's right.  I would be that guy.  Fuck.  Just throwing at anybody?  Yeah, fuck yeah.  Oh, if somebody swings by, just, you know, pick up a stick and start hitting somebody on the back of the head.  Yeah. 
[01:59:30]  You're a thug.  Yeah, yeah, I know.  That's right.  I like that.  Sneaky rock throwing guy.  Wait, do they have alcohol in Egypt?  I mean, like beer and stuff?  I don't know what their poison is.  I'm sure they have the alcohol, but what is their poison?  Islamic, I mean.  You know what their poison is over there?  They're not Islamic.  Maybe they're who?  That's just it.  Oh, no, no.  I'm sorry.  Christian and Islamic.  I think it's divided or something.  Yeah, they got some Christians over there.  Well, it's the thing.  If, I mean, a country with no beer, I mean, I would fucking go nuts too.  No, they probably got beer in Egypt. 
[02:00:00]  In Egypt, you know.  It's probably shitty, because you have to use that water from the Nile or something.  Oh, jeez.  You know, every once in a while, people need outlet.  I mean, you know, something to turn to.  You know, something to just blow some steam or something.  I'm feeling you.  Absolutely, yes.  We're almost done with you, but what about Charlie Sheen?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What's up?  We were hitting a sex addiction or something?  What was it?  No, I didn't have a chance to read up on it.  Anyways.  Anyways, it's embarrassing tape is back in studio.  They worked on it a little more.  You don't have anything on Charlie Sheen? 
[02:00:30]  Oh, no, yeah, I just don't remember.  I'm sorry.  Can you just, yeah, I don't remember.  What was it?  I mean, I'm not aware.  I haven't had a chance to read up on it.  What's going on with him?  I'm sorry.  No.  No.  You could be the only person alive that doesn't know what happened to Charlie Sheen.  No, I've just been so busy, man.  Like, I'm working.  No, well, because what happens in the mornings, I'm working at my retail job.  Then from there, like, two days a week, I have class.  And then three days, I'm at CNBC.  You don't have class any days of the week.  No, no, I do.  Well, oh.  No, truly. 
[02:01:00]  Believe me, you don't.  Well, I had photography last night until 11.  How'd that go?  Oh, pretty well, actually.  What did you take pictures of?  Oh, fucking the traffic and the roads, how fucking bad they are and shit like that.  Well, that's the only time I get, you know, to get shoot with a camera.  Are you using, like, Photoshop?  Oh, yes, absolutely.  I just started working on it, you know.  Are you getting good at it?  Oh, yeah, yeah, I think I'm catching on with it, you know, pretty.  It's fun.  Oh, absolutely, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, I like it.  Absolutely, it's fun.  So I can't wait.  I mean, I want to buy one little camera there, the Canon 60D or something like that. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, you're going to get a nice Canon.  Yeah, yeah.  Changeable lenses and shit.  Oh, absolutely.  It'll be fun, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  And what's your goal with photography?  What are you looking to do?  Maybe take some pictures that'll end up in a gallery, or you want to be, like, a journalist,  a photojournalist.  What are you thinking of?  What's your interest?  Well, I like, as a hobby, like, on the weekends, maybe go out in the countryside, like, Pennsylvania  or upstate New York, because there's some beautiful scenic, like, roads and everything.  And then what would you do with those pictures to kind of... 
[02:02:00]  Oh, just for shits and giggles.  So you're going to school, all this school, for photography, for shits and giggles.  Well, actually, well, I'm going to school specifically for broadcast, like, television broadcast.  Uh-huh.  But, I mean, like, I really, I just, that's, like, my plan B. I really want to do music.  So he's photography and television, but he wants to do music.  I don't want to go past the photography thing for a second.  He's obsessed with roads.  It's kind of like a, like, Bridges of Madison County thing going, but it's Oscar and roads. 
[02:02:30]  Can I put my film in your refrigerator?  That sounds like a fucking come online.  Why do you like roads?  Roads?  Oh, no, I like, I mean, because, you know, as you guys might know, I'm, like, a muscle  car aficionado.  So, like, you know...  Aficionado.  Yeah, yeah.  What's that magazine?  Muscle car aficionado.  Oh, no, I mean, yeah.  So, like, on the weekends, you know, when the summertime comes around, the springtime.  Cigar and track.  Hell, yeah.  What kind of car do you have?  Yeah, so, yeah, what do you have?  What kind of muscle car do you got?  I have a 67 Camaro.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, it's really, like, a clone. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, I got, like, a 305 from an 83 Camaro, so it's a V8 5.0 and a four-speed manual.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, it's a Valero Red.  What's your times?  What times are you on that?  Oh, I do it for cruising.  I think I really don't race, you know what I'm saying?  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, that fucking thing slows.  A quarter-mile time or something.  It's too heavy, that fucking thing.  I mean, you know, because it's solid steel and shit like that.  Don't take it out when the roads are cold and the tires are cold.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because you'll probably spin into a guardrail.  You know, the only reason I got that car was because, you know what? 
[02:03:30]  With this car, I'm looking at so much pussy.  It's, like, solely opposite.  Fucking, hey, like, I drive somewhere to, like, Dunkin' Donuts, park it right there,  going for coffee, come back out, and then I'll be, like, a 60-year-old guy.  He's like, oh, I remember this car when I was, came out of Vietnam, I was in high school.  And I'm like, dude, unless, you know, you have tits and, you know, or you're a hot daughter,  then you fucking don't talk to me, man.  You know what I'm saying?  He's probably got tits.  Yeah.  Old guy.  Yeah, old guy.  Oh, that was bad.  Yeah, so you're hoping that you'll walk out of Dunkin' Donuts to your fucking old Camaro  muscle car and hope, like, a bevy of broads are just sprawled on the hood, semi-clad. 
[02:04:00]  It's not happening for you.  Yeah, no, it's not happening.  I mean, that's just, I mean, I guess maybe the movies, you know, paint a picture like  that, you know, like the guy with the hot car, but anyways, fuck it, that's just, you know.  Is it, like, refinished?  Is it painted and looks nice?  Absolutely, yeah, yeah.  Upholstery, everything, is it restored?  Yeah, well, yeah, it was partially done nine years ago from the previous owner, but it's  still in great shape.  Paint still, like, has a glossy finish and everything.  I mean, it does have a couple scratches, you know, I will not lie, but, I mean, but other 
[02:04:30]  than that.  What about your rims?  Oh, yeah, I got Eagle Thrust, I don't know, not Eagle Thrust, they're Torque Thrust.  Eagle Thrust?  No, I take those off immediately.  Yeah, I expect that to break down.  Oh, they're American Raising Torque Thrust, 17.  You got 17s on there?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, with little profiles.  You don't got spinners?  Oh, no.  Because you're, you know, because you're Colombian.  Oh, no, no spinners for me.  Having that Hispanic kind of background, you would like, does it jump? 
[02:05:00]  Does the front hydraulically come off the ground?  No, no, maybe.  When you throw up gang signs?  Oh, no, no, no gang signs.  Oh, no, no, no gang signs.  I'm getting a request.  What's this?  Coffey.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Wait, what is it?  I've been drinking a lot of that lately, man.  You've been drinking a lot of what?  Coffey.  Yeah.  Coffey.  Coffey.  Coffey.  And I don't even think it's a New York accent.  No, it's a weird accent.  He's got some weird things going on.  Oh, absolutely, yeah.  Hey, one more thing, and then we'll let you go.  Oh, okay.  Sports. 
[02:05:30]  You like sports Super Bowls Sunday?  Oh, yeah.  I don't know, man.  You following the coverage?  Well, yeah, a little.  I mean, I was with my friends.  You know, we're rooting for the Jets, but now maybe it'll be a boring Super Bowl, man.  It doesn't look promising.  Hold on.  Janine brings up a great point.  Yeah.  He's Colombian, and he can't say coffee, right?  Yeah, that's true, man.  How do you say that?  Coffey.  Coffey.  Coffey.  Coffey.  Coffey.  Coffey.  Coffey.  Yeah, sure.  Say it properly, please.  Coffey.  Coffey.  Coffey.  Oh, coffee. 
[02:06:00]  Coffey.  Coffey, yeah, coffee.  No, coffey.  No, you say it first, then I'll say it.  No, you just say it properly.  Just say coffee.  Coffey.  What?  Coffey.  Wait, you say it, Anthony, you say it again?  I did already.  Oh, yeah.  Coffey.  No, coffee.  Coffey.  No.  Coffey.  Coffey.  Coffey.  Coffey.  I don't know.  Anyways, hey, you guys ever had harpoon beer?  It's really good. 
[02:06:30]  Fucking shit's phenomenal.  Hey, what's up, Dan?  Jesus.  I just made a doody.  Oh, nice.  Oh, shit.  I just shook his hand.  Fuck.  Oh, he shook his hand.  He wiped his butthole.  God damn it.  Yeah.  Awesome.  Awesome.  Awesome.  All right, Oscar.  Well, it's great to see you again, Oscar.  Nice to see you guys, too.  We can only do about 10 minutes with you.  Check in.  A little exhausting for me.  Oh, yeah.  It's good to check in with you, though.  Absolutely.  That's good.  All right, Phil.  Is that it?  Anything else on your mind?  Quickly?  Let's see.  Let's see.  I don't know.  Hopefully, freaking springtime will roll in quick, man.  I'm sick of the snow.  Oh, the snow. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, man.  Man, it's like you can't drive anywhere, man.  Last night, I almost clipped a cup car.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, I was doing 25.  He was doing like 35, right?  And then it wasn't on his side of the freaking street.  It wasn't clean.  So I know he saw me coming.  I saw him coming.  And he would just, you know, threw himself at me.  I was like, you mother.  Anyways.  So you had to move out of the way for the cop.  Yeah, look, yeah.  Well, that's what you did.  It was dope.  Give him a little respect.  It was no emergency.  Move out of the way.  Hell yeah.  I love cops, though, man.  They're fucking fun.  You ask them questions about their freaking, oh, one day, fucking day.  Yo, I was, I was, I thought it was a search and rescue dog, right? 
[02:07:30]  So I went and started petting this dog on the head.  And the one lady next to me asked the police officer, hey, what kind of dog is it?  And he goes, narcotics.  And I was, oh, nice little dog.  And I walked away.  Because it was a Sunday morning.  And I didn't know what I had on me from Saturday night.  So I was like, I don't want to risk it.  You know what I mean?  I never know.  Yeah, that happened.  Especially this Saturday, man.  I went out after work.  You know, I had a couple of beers.  Can we ask him?  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  You're starting.  Okay.  You're starting.  Now you got it.  So what happened? 
[02:08:00]  I was drinking freaking Foster's Premium Ale.  What happened to the harpoon?  Oh, no.  So what happened was that I drank two of those 25-ouncers.  From there, I went home.  And I had six of the Molson XXX.  And then my brother was like, hey, you want to go out and get sushi?  And I'm like, fuck yeah.  And then it was me, my brother, and my brother's girlfriend.  We went out and got sushi.  And then there, the lady made some homemade vodka wine.  It was at a Japanese authentic restaurant.  And it was cranberries made with vodka. 
[02:08:30]  And it tasted like wine.  It was what?  Yeah, cranberries and vodka.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Yeah.  What type of fruit did you just say?  Cranberry?  No, cranberry?  No.  Well, the cranberry.  Cranberry?  Yeah, cranberry.  Cranberry.  Cranberry.  Anyways, Walt, the little red one, you know, it goes into.  Cranberry.  They still have.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Cranberry.  Before you.  Shit.  They still haven't gotten past cup car yet.  Cup car.  Cup car.  Cup car.  What's up?  Anyways.  Yeah, what did you almost hit, Cliff?  A cup car.  A cup car. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, oh, oh.  They're not past the cup car.  Yeah, yeah.  A police officer car.  All right, back to the box.  All right, cool.  So, yeah, so we were at the restaurant and there was, like, a bunch of, like, nice, good-looking  girls in front of us.  I mean, they were 17, 18, maybe 19, who knows, but then I was.  21, 22, keep going.  Jesus.  Light.  Yeah, so, I mean, they started laughing about something and I was, like, so, I mean, I was  drunk at that point.  So, I go, I threw out, I said something, I don't know what I said, but everybody started  laughing.  Everybody, even the freaking, the chefs at the sushi bar and everything. 
[02:09:30]  I was like, I just can't remember.  And then after that, oh, we went back to this restaurant.  Hiroshima joke, I bet.  Speaking of bombing.  Yeah, well, yeah, well, bombing, yeah.  You got to end the story somehow.  Oh, okay, yeah.  Wrap it up, wrap it up.  Afterwards, we went to the office and I was like, you know, I'm going to play my A-game  here, you know, and we talked to some girls.  And then what happened was that we started drinking harpoons, right?  I must have drank, like, six pints right there.  And then I saw this little one girl there with a green sweater and everything, so I go up 
[02:10:00]  to her.  It turns out she was a fucking lesbian.  I don't know, I just, I mean, but yeah, she was, I was like, hey, how's it going?  And, yeah, so that's where, yeah.  End of story.  Oh, yeah.  And then I know how I got home.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Were you telling these little stories?  Have a play.  Yeah, I know.  Fuck that.  Yeah.  It's a listener.  I remember getting home anyways.  All right, Oscar.  All right, hey, see you guys.  It's always a pleasure.  Oh, thank you.  I'm a huge fan of the nervous Oscar. 
[02:10:30]  Huge fan.  I think most of us are.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Awesome.  Well, thank you.  Yeah.  Thank you guys.  Yeah, we got to get Otto in here from Otto and George.  Is that okay?  Oh, absolutely, yeah.  He's playing comics at Foxwoods tonight, tomorrow, and Saturday.  Five shows, foxwoods.com.  There he goes.  That's a great show to check out.  So we'll take a break and get off.  Oscar.  Cup car, right?  Cup car.  Cup car.  What was the other one?  The coffee.  I think there's a Q in there somewhere.  Coffee.  Coffee.  Coffee.  Coffee.  Break, and then Otto. 
[02:11:00]  We got anything to break?  Anything?  Nothing?  Just hit something.  Yeah, we'll just do it.  The O.B. Anthony Show on the virus.  Sirius XM.  Are you sure this is legal?  You're listening to The Virus.  Sirius 197 XM 202.  In honor of Black History Month, the O.B.

[02:11:30]  Today's tweet comes from D.D.K.L.Z.  Oh, D.D. Kills.  I'm scared.  Who writes?  When I was in jail, a big black monster came up on me and said,  Dude, if you touch me, I'll hand you your dick.  Well said, D.D. Kills.  Stay tuned all month as we continue to celebrate the advancements of the African-American culture  here on The O.B. Anthony Show.

Send that backwards.  We got Otto from Otto and George walking down the hall.  Oh, I know.  He's playing comics at Foxwoods tonight, tomorrow, and Saturday.  Five shows.  Foxwoods.com.  They're doing the comedy thing down there, and they're doing...  Not down there, sorry. 
[02:12:30]  Up there, sorry.  Up there.  Well, it depends on where you are.  Actually, the other place is doing comedy as well.  Yeah.  They're both doing comedy very well.  We don't play favorites.  What's up, Otto?  There he is.  It's Otto.  How are you, sir?  What are you doing?  Are we on the air?  Otto, yes.  You're on the air?  Just did the big plug for...  Did the big plug for comics.  Hey, are we doing this alphabetically?  Are you sure you don't want to fucking go throw a lump of shit at the R train and get  another guest on?  You call me?  I've been 35 years in this business. 
[02:13:00]  I'm going to be fucking Green Room looking at Roland not working.  Bad fact reading fucking Inquirer in there.  In all fairness, we should have gotten you in here earlier.  Who is that fucking Wildebeest that was in here earlier?  Oh, Wildebeest.  Oscar?  You want him back in so you can beat him up?  No.  I didn't even know you're here.  The problem is you guys come in some weird back door and then you're way down there.  I swear to God, I didn't know you were here.  Oh, no.  I'm just fucking...  Because you would have had fun with Oscar.  You would have beat him up.  What is Oscar plugging up?  I'll be in a refrigerator box on 10th Avenue just writing. 
[02:13:30]  Oscar used to be a goon.  He used to be an intern with us and we're just obsessed and fascinated by the guy because  he's just...  His accent?  You can't figure his accent out?  No.  We don't know what it is.  Supposedly, his parents are Colombian or something.  He was born in Colombia, but he came here.  I don't even know his story.  He tells his story.  He's very shady, too.  Oh, yeah.  Very shady.  Yeah, yeah.  Extremely shady.  He is on a constant hunt for pussy, though.  And he never seems to get it.  Oh, okay.  So he's breathing.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's working and he's trying. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, good.  And we're just asking him about Egypt and all that stuff.  Yeah, I want to know.  Are you watching the coverage?  What?  Is it a surprise, man?  I mean...  What's the new beef over there?  Yeah, well, they want, you know, Hosni Mubarak out.  Ugh.  Another...  Whatever.  He's been there for 30 years.  How dead would I be if I was over there?  Oh, my God.  I'm a fucking American Jew New Yorker.  That's everything they hate.  That's a triple threat.  Oh, God.  Ugh.  Yeah.  Hey, why don't you stop with your fighting? 
[02:14:30]  And it just hit you with fucking clubs.  Oh, it's awful.  Yeah.  I was watching last night and they were just literally throwing fire at each other like  it was the year fucking three.  I was going to say.  They're just throwing fire at each other.  You might have to go back to the cavemen for that one.  Yeah, that's what cavemen did.  Rocks, sticks, and fire.  They saw fire and it was like...  Why not kill each other?  I mean, there's no hope in those countries.  There's no hope for improvement. 
[02:15:00]  You can't win the lottery.  There's no show business.  There's no way out of their situation.  No, you're not going to get a great gig and work your way up to make a great living and  family.  No, you're just living in dirt.  Like, everything's dirt over there.  Their houses are made of dirt.  Oh, it's hard.  What a horrible...  We're so blessed to just be...  Even if a homeless person here can go to Hawaii and be homeless and live on  coconuts.  You know, it was so lucky to be born here.  Yeah.  You don't even realize... 
[02:15:30]  Absolutely.  And then you see this shit and you're like...  We're in the top, top of this, you know, planet.  The lowest scum in America is better than 99% of the world's fucking upper echelon.  Absolutely.  They can watch TV, go to a shelter or whatever.  Yeah.  Plenty of ways to get around it.  Not there.  They fucked up.  They're lobbing.  I swear I expected to see a fucking catapult and a trebuchet come out and them launching  fucking putrid heads at each other.  Just putrefied, diseased heads. 
[02:16:00]  Whose dumb idea was that trebuchet?  I love the trebuchet.  Bouchet.  Trebuchet.  That thing is great.  That's a big fucking rock thrower.  It's a big fucking...  Oh, yeah.  Based on leverage.  And now stupid...  Like the catapult's a little one, but this one's based on like weights and leverage.  Wow.  Fucking amazing.  You need a big stone.  Like, how do you set that up in a battle?  Yeah, look at that thing.  That's fucking amazing looking.  That's ancient.  Wow.  Yeah, that's an old school shit.  And now hacky morning shows use that to see how far they can throw a pumpkin.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:16:30]  That's what they do.  Really?  That's their little humor?  We're going to try to throw a pumpkin and see if we can get it further than a cannon can.  We got a trebuchet.  Of course, trebuchet is sponsored by Budweiser, the king of beards.  Wow.  Horrid.  Hoping to hit turd in the outfield.  Yeah.  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Now turd's going to try to catch the pumpkin fired by the trebuchet.  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  And then behind the scenes...  Oh, that's awful man cunt. 
[02:17:00]  And then behind the scenes, turd, we got to go into a production studio and make believe  you're in a field because we can't actually throw pumpkins at you.  Yeah.  We don't have a trebuchet.  We're all in the studio.  Turd, turd!  We faked this.  Ah, turd!  Here comes a pumpkin turd!  Get ready to catch it!  Oh no, it's hit turd!  It's hit turd!  We'll be right back!  What an asshole.  And a potty mouth.  Yes, quite a potty mouth.  Turd.  And I apologize for saying the Egypt thing is fun, but as a viewer, it's fun to watch. 
[02:17:30]  Of course it is.  I have to say that.  Sure, you're not there.  Who's going to deny that?  But no one wants to admit that, that they're watching, oh wow, this is a fun show to check  out.  Why do you think they're airing it 24-7, as the kids like to say?  I am watching it, and they know people want to watch it because it's exciting to watch a  real action movie that's taking place with real people.  Yeah.  That's what it is.  It's not CGI.  When they throw Molotov cocktails, it's real fire.  And the camels running through with the guys with whips?  Oh, there's guys on camels and there's tanks in the street.  What a disparity in fucking weaponry. 
[02:18:00]  We haven't seen that since...  Did Charleston Heston do those type of movies?  Charleston Heston.  Who did those type of movies where they were on camels and shit?  Oh, he did that shit.  He did.  Yeah, yeah.  Lawrence of Arabia?  Lawrence of Arabia.  We haven't seen it.  That would have been the line.  Right, since Lawrence of Arabia.  Well, he also did the fucking Ten Commandments, whereas Moses, he led his people out of Egypt,  away from Pharaoh.  And then, you know, Martin of the Red Sea, all that shit.  But that was the Jews.  And then he was confused with his acting. 
[02:18:30]  He didn't know which side to be on.  What do you mean?  Well, at first he was...  He's being Moses, and then he's being like a fucking prince in the desert.  Oh, okay.  Well, at first...  Or whatever the fuck he was.  You know, he was launched off because they were killing all the kids.  So he was launched off, and then he was found by, you know, it's an Egyptian...  What's her name there?  He was the go-to Bible guy, but Moses was a Jew.  He probably looked like Jackie Mason.  They knew.  Fucking embarrassed to come back, like Jesus came back.  Kind of look like Charlton Heston, six foot four with blue eyes, chiseled and everything. 
[02:19:00]  Why don't we go?  Everybody, let my people go, Pharaoh.  Yeah.  Old school nun in Philly.  I went to Christmas Mass.  If I had said this, sorry, but maybe we could add to it.  Looks at my son, blonde hair, blue eyes, and actually said, that's what baby Jesus looked  like.  And I went, are you fucking kidding me?  And she's an old nun.  Like, she's ready to drop, and she thinks Jesus had the fucking blonde hair and the blue  eyes.  You know what she needs?  A dick stuck in her.  Are you kidding me?  Oh, wow. 
[02:19:30]  Can we at least admit he was a bit on the darker side?  I will never admit that.  He might have had a tan, I would say.  He's the son of God.  Why can't he just be born in the white?  Oh, really?  Maybe a blonde hair, blue eye guy is walking around the Middle East.  Middle East?  So what?  Sure.  That's because he's Jesus.  It's a miracle.  Maybe that's why they had to get rid of him.  It's a miracle.  It didn't look like the rest of them.  Whatever.  He walked on water.  He can't be a white guy in Egypt.  He'd be like, oh, look at him.  He's white.  But I'm thinking if this old nun is thinking that, my faith is in deep fucking trouble.  She's thinking blonde hair, blue eyes for the Jesus. 
[02:20:00]  Every picture I've ever seen of Jesus, he's a white guy with the long hair.  So I've got to go by pictures.  She went blonde.  Yeah.  That's what I mean.  You have blonde hair.  White guy, skinny.  In front of the church, it's darker hair.  Let me show you my impression of Christ being unnailed from the cross.  No.  Ready?  Okay.  He's dead, right?  Okay.  Defeat!  Defeat!  Sorry.  He's tipping over.  He should have went feet first.  You're going to be doing that at Comics at Foxwoods? 
[02:20:30]  At Comics.  Comics, Foxwoods, Otto from Otto and George will be there, of course.  Looking forward to this.  Tonight, tomorrow, and Saturday.  Five shows.  Real professional showbiz gig.  That is a good one, man.  Timmy, you did the Foxwoods, right?  I did, yeah.  It was great.  Really good, man.  I hear the room's good.  I hear the crowds are great.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  The hotel sold out because of the Super Bowl.  I just hope people are in a good mood and not depressed because of the Jets not being in it or whatever.  No.  I think they're over that.  They're over it.  They're over that, so that's going to help you out.  Yeah?  Okay, cool. 
[02:21:00]  Because it's just casual watchers.  You're right in between Jets didn't make it and Pats didn't make it, people.  Really?  You know, they're the people that are going to be there gambling.  Bah!  Let's go see Otto and George.  Yeah.  I'm still pissed at, not pissed at the Jets, but like, fuck, we were close.  They got so fucking close.  Fucking close.  They had that shitty first half.  Oh, we'll get them next year, guys, right?  We'll get them next year.  No, you won't.  Shut up.  I told one of the guys Munsters was on TV the last time they got even close.  They stink.  That's great. 
[02:21:30]  Boy, that's some perspective, man.  Yeah.  That's what sucks about football.  Munsters?  Yeah, Munsters lunch pail was bad.  Oh, that's brilliant.  I was talking to a guy in my building, and I said, I don't want to start over.  No?  Because now you've got to start over, and every game has to be this big thing.  It's exhausting.  And they got lucky with so many of them games, they shouldn't even have been in the playoffs.  It's like, now we've got to start over again.  They'll probably fuck it up.  Because you see, they just dropped the first five games, and you just know it's over.  Do you think they get depressed, the players?  They don't give a shit. 
[02:22:00]  I think they get depressed.  No, I think they do.  Because every game means so much in football, so I think it hurts a lot more.  And that Super Bowl bonus has to be nice.  Oh, yeah.  Not only that, the exposure for you as an individual.  As a player, you're going to get endorsements.  If you're like the hero of the game, you're fucking, yeah, that's got to be a drag.  And I think someone is, hold on, I've got to set this guy straight.  Ethan in California, go ahead.  Hey, I'm wondering if you guys have seen the Angry Birds Egyptian Peace Treaty video. 
[02:22:30]  Well, Anthony.  Video?  No.  Ant made one that was really funny that went around.  I just made a single Photoshop thing.  This is a video?  Oh, okay.  Yeah, there's a video.  If you go on YouTube, type in Angry Birds Peace Treaty.  Angry Birds Peace Treaty.  Okay, I thought it was Anthony's.  I was going to set you straight, because Ant tweeted that a few days ago, and it went  very well.  No, no, it was my idea.  He Photoshopped the whole fucking thing.  I know, exactly.  All right, we'll check it out there, Ethan.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right, you guys have a good one.  All right, Brother Joe's on the line.  Brother Joe, Anthony's brother, what's up? 
[02:23:00]  Hi, Otto.  Hi, George.  Hey, what's up?  I miss you guys.  I miss you guys.  I'm looking at Obama.  Doesn't Obama always look like he's been in a pool too long?  He's got those purple lips on him.  He's very, uh, he looks cold.  Yeah.  He does look cold.  He's so bleached.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's going gray by the day, too.  Yeah, he really is.  Wow.  I think he's using some of the hair dye.  Yeah.  You think he had to go dye?  Yeah, I think he's covering up some of the gray.  Because they were talking about how gray's turned since he's even been a president.  He's so unrhythmic for a Negro.  Did you see him rocking out at the, uh, what do you call it, the tribute to Paul McCartney? 
[02:23:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  At that thing in D.C.?  No rhythm.  Ugh.  When Hey Jude was playing.  He's half white, and that is the part that really is who he is.  Jimmy said a long time ago.  Uncomordinated black Jerry Lewis.  This is a toe-tapper.  It's awful.  He's a nerd.  Yeah.  Jimmy says he's nerdy.  That's the part.  Became president, the half white part.  Yeah.  Uh, Joe.  Yes?  What have you got in the, uh, what have you got in the can? 
[02:24:00]  I was just, I was calling to plug a couple of, uh, perhaps, fuck, to plug a couple of gigs.  Oh, what do you got?  I got, uh, Harrah's tonight.  I'm at the other gambling spot.  Ah.  Harrah's Atlantic City.  We're playing over at the Eden Lounge.  And then, uh, most importantly, the one that you've been tweeting, thank you, Anthony.  Of course.  In Metuchen, New Jersey.  It's a theater.  It's a forum theater in Metuchen.  We're playing there on the 17th.  Wow.  And tickets are still on sale.  To you.  The, uh, official, uh, U2 tribute band. 
[02:24:30]  Do you know one of my...  We are official.  We are official.  We actually got, uh, we got to go ahead from, uh, Paul McGinnis to do whatever we wanted.  To actually say official.  No.  Yeah, they're, they're the only official U2 tribute band.  And it was, it was actually, it went through that they, they're the official tribute band.  Holy shit.  Of U2.  I didn't know this.  Congratulations, John.  It's great.  You know where I'm going?  You know where I'm going for, uh, Super Bowl Sunday?  Where?  For the fourth, for the fourth time this year, down to, uh, down to Fort Lauderdale.  Um, well, actually just outside of Boca. 
[02:25:00]  Playing on a seven-deck ship for a, uh, it's another corporate thing that, uh, that we're doing down that way.  Is he banking?  Oh, yeah.  And at least, oh, at least you're going somewhere for the Super Bowl.  That's nice.  Yeah, we, uh.  That's great.  Down to Florida.  Nice.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's beautiful.  Great.  Uh, uh, by the way, uh, now that your, your plugs are out of the way, we do have a copy of a certain song.  Oh.  Uh, that Joe Curry dropped off last night.  I can't really tell you this. 
[02:25:30]  Uh, it is, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It is probably, I haven't said the name or anything.  Oh, no problem.  It is probably one of the most embarrassing, uh, moments in band history.  How embarrassing.  And I said I was going to disavow any knowledge or any involvement.  You wrote it, and I want you to fess up right now, because I am just the vocalist.  You are the guitar player in this, and you wrote the damn song.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  Hey, come on.  You know what, uh, Bon Jovi was huge back then. 
[02:26:00]  I think it was more like, um, very 80s sounding with the keyboard, and I think I tried to put a little Duran Duran wine in my voice.  Now I just pour wine down my throat.  Try to kill the pain.  It's good for you, Papa.  It's good for you, Papa.  What are you guys airing that piece of shit?  Right now.  Right now.  Stay on the line if you can.  Right now.  I'm just going to, I'm going to just, uh, lower you in the mix a little bit. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah, try to stay quiet and listen.  Yeah, just stay, Joe, I'm lowering it for a minute, but we'll go right back to you.  Is that up for this song?  Uh, if I'm not, if I'm not there when you come back to me, you know why.  That's the setup.  That's the setup.  I guess the band was going for a love ballad.  Yeah, the setup for the song is, well, I was, I was taking, real quick, I was taking flying lessons out at, uh, out of MacArthur Airport.  There was, uh, the daughter of this, uh, flight instructor that I was, uh, absolutely smitten with, and, uh, that's pretty much, uh, what it is. 
[02:27:00]  I wrote, I wrote a song to impress her.  Oh.  I went down to a gig, so I wrote it in a pinch.  Did it work?  No.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And we moved on to Paul McGinnis?  Oh, yeah, yeah, no, I actually, uh, yeah, we got, uh.  Holy shit, I'm, I can't believe that one.  I'm a massive U2 fan, always have been, even though the last few have been a little rough a few years, but.  Well, we had to get, we had to get permission to play at, uh, to play down, down in, uh, Orlando, to play, uh, Disney World. 
[02:27:30]  And, um, that was the only way we could get it, was by, uh, getting it to sign off on it.  Holy shit, that's awesome.  Congrats.  All right, back to the song.  Sorry.  Oh, boy.  That's just stuck in my head.  And now I want to preface.  Okay.  Again, I have to preface this, because you motherfuckers, um, are gonna take this in the context of, you know, it was recorded yesterday.  More years have been in front of me after recording this song than were before me. 
[02:28:00]  Well, why don't we just say the year?  Doing this song.  What year is this?  This is in the 80s.  It's so, you know.  It's early age.  I was out of the army for, like, uh, two years, so it had to be 82.  This is, yeah, this is very early to mid-80s.  The sound was, was, that was what everybody was kind of doing.  We're talking, we're talking 30 years.  Dude, this is the 30 years old.  We're talking, Mubarak just went into office.  We're talking Anwar, Anwar Sadat was barely dead.  Right.  He was, he was still warm, still warm. 
[02:28:30]  You can hear it in Anthony's voice, because, uh, it sounds like he had no nuts.  I mean, his voice was, was noticeably higher back then.  Yeah, a little higher, although my range is better now.  What were you, like 25, 26?  Yeah, right?  I was a mere child.  And, uh, Joe wrote this song.  I, um, I sang it.  Uh, I believe, Mike Klotz is playing bass?  Mike Klotz on bass.  Louie Graziano on the drums.  Is the drummer?  And plank foot. 
[02:29:00]  Plank keyboard.  Joe Curry on the keyboards.  My brother is, uh, backup, uh, vocals.  And, uh, of course, great guitar.  It has the obligatory guitar lead in this song, of course.  Uh, harmonies.  And, and, uh, vocals that are so mushy.  And lyrics are so, um, douchey.  Douchey, mushy, lovey-dovey.  They do not reflect my feelings now, which I would write a song saying, suck my cock, you  fucking whore. 
[02:29:30]  That's what I would write now.  I hear a lot of, uh, a lot of excuses.  Let's just hear it.  Yeah.  I'm sure it's good.  I wanted to preface it first.  No, dude, I'm sure it's good.  What's the name of the song?  The name of the song is the name of the girl.  It is just called merely Dara.  Oh!  Ted Bundy didn't apologize this much.  He fucking played a thing.  And a cute, a cute, longest set up in the history of Bad Bits.  By the way, cute story. 
[02:30:00]  Stand by for boiled shit.  We were playing a gig.  We were playing a gig.  And there was a, uh, kind of a altercation going on at the door by, by the bouncer and  some chick.  And, uh, the chick is yelling like she wanted to get in, didn't want to pay the cover charge  and she's causing a fucking problem.  And, uh, me and Joe Curry are standing around and I was like, you know, fuck is this bitch?  And he goes, oh, that's Dara.  Okay.  So this sweet fucking, you know, love ballad is to a flaming cunt. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, great.  Flaming cunt.  They all are.  Oh, no.  Okay, hold on, hold on.  From 19, from 1982.  I gotta cover up.  I can't, I am literally covering my face now with my shirt because I can't fucking watch  or look at anyone.  Joe, and Joe, you, uh, what's the name of the band?  The name of the band was Finster.  No, I thought this was As Is.  No, this was, oh, you know what?  You might be right, Anthony.  Right.  As Is with Z's probably. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, of course.  Okay.  Of course.  Why wouldn't it be?  All right.  Here's Dara from 1982 with Anthony on vocals.  Oh, no, I'm not looking at it.  And, uh, Joe, who's now a big, huge star on guitar.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  It was off a tape.  It was off a cassette tape.  So relax.  That's all right.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  It doesn't really matter.  This is horrible.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Someone once told me, being in love's a game. 
[02:31:30]  I want you to wait.  You never feel the same.  It doesn't matter.  It came to be for the sun.  It took you to scatter the pieces of my broken heart.  Endless games turned into seamless nights.  I can't do anything until you've been eating right.  Feeling rejected.  So she threw away. 
[02:32:00]  Did you pause it for one second?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I mean, look.  Shut up.  There are endless nights.  We've all had them.  Your heart was broken.  Dara broke your heart.  I knew Jimmy wouldn't just let it play.  It was not bad.  Oh, God.  It's so cushy.  What?  Disgustingly fucking generic garbage.  What do you sound like?  It's driving me nuts.  We need someone that knows their 80s shit.  It's got a Boy George kind of a tinge mixed with shoving Jack the Lane's lifeless cock into 
[02:32:30]  a juicer.  Otto will be at Comics at Foxwoods tonight, tomorrow, and Saturday.  Foxwoods.com.  I'm literally sweating.  I'm sweating.  Why?  Are you still thinking about Dara and how she broke your heart?  He didn't.  I swear.  You had endless nights.  Yeah.  Did you record that in a studio?  You should have been arrested for trespassing.  Oh, people are asking if me and Joe went back to back singing the vocals. 
[02:33:00]  Long hair?  You had the long hair?  Oh, well, I'll have the, you know.  But it's a mix between an 80s new wave band and kind of like...  AIDS.  AIDS.  Thank you, Jim.  They're calling you Aunt Laban.  Aunt Laban coming in for Mike and Woodbridge.  Did you have a bandana tied around your mid-thigh hanging down and a couple tied around the mic 
[02:33:30]  stand?  Yeah, yeah.  I did have five multicolored pastel-colored belts, each one a little looser than the next.  Oh, jeez.  Were you guys?  They didn't.  I swear I did.  Ew, they should have all been around your neck.  Were you guys?  Is Joe there?  People are complaining that they've just been ant-rolled.  E-Rock saying it sounds like wham.  You have the photos.  You have the promo photos of that. 
[02:34:00]  There's promo photos for as-is.  Oh, no.  Are there?  Send them in so Aunt can tweet them.  Oh, God.  You got to tweet that shit, Aunt.  Oh, God.  So, did you write the lyrics while Joe oiled your butt?  Sounds a little like...  Were you guys hoping it would make a John Hughes movie?  Put it this way.  At the time, I never thought if we ever got radio play with this song, it would be like  this right now.  I was really hoping for something a little better. 
[02:34:30]  It's Hump X from Whack Bag, Men Without Dignity, coming in.  Anthony goes to Hollywood.  Someone just wrote Paul in PA.  You've got the top.  You've got the power.  Dude, you were high.  Your heart was broken.  What are you going to do?  You sing about it.  That's what you do.  You write like a power ballad.  Steven S. from Bayshore, A Suck of Seagulls.  We were a little more old, because I was getting into what happened with this man's journey.  Stop judging him! 
[02:35:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha!  Just give me something  Oh, no, something to love me  But bad times, they're one thing  I've always needed you  And this thing's turning to  Sleepless night  I give you anything  I tell you we need it right  Only open breathing  You will see  I'm not here  Come on, baby 
[02:35:30]  Stay with me  Oh, Dara  Oh, Dara  Oh, Dara  Oh, Dara  Oh, Dara  You said you heard my way  I'm sure we have a viral dance  Oh, Dara  Ew  You should have been singing  Oh, Dara  Oh, Dara  You look like Vincent  Vincent  Vincent the Chin  Over there  Shielding your fucking shameful face  Did she save the final dance for you?  Yeah, I did  The fact that Jimmy said we should have been singing 
[02:36:00]  My asshole is puckering  The fact that Jimmy said we should have been singing  Oh, Dara  Because this is so gay  Oh, man  It's fucking  But, you know, you wanted to save the last dance for you  Oh, dude  Who are you fucking Tom Cruise  And pouring the fourth  You ran in the rain to go to your prom  This is so bad  Oh, wait a minute  Keyboard player Joe Curry checking in on text  Oh, God  And  He just put his hands into a meat grinder 
[02:36:30]  Retribution  Oh, let's see  Hey, look  Look, if you've got to get a positive out of this thing  The harmonies were okay  Think about it  Just take everything else  There's no positives out of this thing  Except for everybody's blood  Joe Curry says  I have promo photos  30 years  Wow  And we finally get this shit on the radio  Wow  Wow, this should have been a hit  Every Dara  Both Daras in the country  Would have loved this  Maybe you can update it  Oh, LeWanda 
[02:37:00]  Oh, shit  Oh, no  I knew this would be really bad  It's not that bad, though  I mean, Dara was going to save that last dance for you  I understand that  People think this is an air supply tribute band  I just tweeted a picture of what Ant looks like  As we're listening to his old song  Yeah, yeah  I've seen pedophiles walk into court prouder than he is right now  I can see the picture  This sounds like haircut 100 
[02:37:30]  No  They were more  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do  Oh, Dara  You know what happened?  Ba-ba-ba-ba  Save the last dance for me  No, I don't think the last dance was being saved  What was it?  It was something about romance  What was it?  What was it?  I hope we'd have a fine  Yeah, I'm sure we'd have a fine romance  Are you sure you weren't singing through a hole in a fucking restaurant area  Singing a bromance?  I didn't know Ant and Joe were rock set 
[02:38:00]  You'd have a fine romance?  Yeah, yeah  Apparently that is the line  That's a good lyric  Dan S. in Toronto  Kaja  Kaja boo-boo  Kaja boo-boo  And then UCF Gavin in Orlando  Sounds like culture flub  What happens next show?  This chorus is getting me  Can we hear the whole chorus again?  So I gotta hear the lyrics  You'll hear it again and again  Listen to the words  We don't know when to stop this fucking mess  Oh, I believe it's hard to get tiredly 
[02:38:30]  Oh  Oh, my God  Ah  Good  Let's hear the guitar show 
[02:39:00]  Time is the healer  Don't let it get down  But fate is the dealer  Pause that for one second  Time is the healer  Time is the healer  I thought I heard fate is the dealer  Can we rewind that?  That couldn't have been what he said  I must have misheard that 
[02:39:30]  Because time is the healer  You have to say what you said to Anthony  Hey, you wrote it, faggot  Hey, fate is a dealer  You said it  This is turning brother against brother  Wow, if your ears could fucking hang each other  They would  So you didn't have to hear this  Wait, let me hear that line again  I want to make sure  That was a pretty good one  Because fate is a dealer  Bye, baby  Bye, bye  Bye, bye  Time is the healer 
[02:40:00]  Don't let it get down  With fate is the dealer  Others will come around  I keep on saying  Soon I'll be over you  But then I keep praying  Praying that you want me to  And this thing is turning to  All right, we got it  Endless days  Sleepless nights  You have that now  It's because you drink till 6am 
[02:40:30]  And you fucking  You're killing me  Oh, fuck, this is so bad  Why?  It's not  It's, you know  Oh, I can't take this  It doesn't get better over here  And you don't pray  Spanky1684 on Twitter  Tears for queers  Praying that you want me to  When's the last time you prayed  And it wasn't over a toilet  I swear I'll never drink that much again 
[02:41:00]  And Conway Tweedy  He writes  Flock of seagulls shit  Oh, the 80s  It's quintessentially the 80s  It's 80s  Meets hairband though  Yes  There's like a  They're bridging the gap  Between the two genres here  Sure  I can't believe  Ever being that  Talentless  We've gotten as far as we have  I can't believe it  That was just fucking long  Yeah, but you know what  It says they picture me  Doing a slow motion  Roundhouse kick in the air 
[02:41:30]  Oh, in the video  What is Dara doing in the video?  Oh, hopefully  Fucking getting an abortion  Having a miscarriage  No, she's probably  Walking out the door  Or she doesn't like you  She never liked you  Oh, yeah  So I'd be rejected  You could take this song  And put it to Steve Perry's  Oh, Sherry video  And it would fit perfectly  Probably would be  No, because they loved each other  Maybe you're standing outside  Holding flowers in the rain  And they're wilted  While she closes the door 
[02:42:00]  Someone says in the video  Dara's flying into a bridge abutment  In her plane  Maybe she's walking with a  Paula Poundstone-like pantsuit  Through this 1982  And that's what  Chicks wore in videos  They're calling this song  Oh, Diarrhea  Let me go to Rick in El Paso  Rick  Yeah, just done  Docking  I knew this was going to be bad  But this is so painful 
[02:42:30]  It's good  To live through  Lyrically, it's really good, though  I mean  You hit a lot of emotional home runs  What was the stage outfit all about?  Was it a Mike Reno thing?  Where were you at?  Did you have Japanese shit?  Zippers?  Where were you?  Yeah, you know  Parachute pants  Maybe a shirt with some Japanese lettering on it  No headband  No headband  But, you know  Multicolored belts  Cut-off shit 
[02:43:00]  What color belts  Oh, like one  Red one  A yellow  Purple  Green  Fucking  And one was  What is that?  That's the song  Joe just drove into a fucking river  Joe's recording something right now  That's better than the song  All right  Yeah  Nothing  So wait  Bad phone  You had multicolored belts  Joe Colback  And you wear them on your thighs  No, no  I would wear them around my waist  But one would be like  Like  Worn like  The right  The right size 
[02:43:30]  Yeah  And then the next one would be maybe  One too loose  So it would hang on one side  A little lower  Is that how the Hulk  Kept his pants on when he got bigger?  That's a fucking horrible idea  Five belts in case  What, you turn into Bob Kelly overnight?  They were different in size  Yeah, they should have been  Different colors  I don't know, this ain't bad, right?  I mean, you know  If you told me this was Duran Duran  Or any of those other mediocre bands  I would think 
[02:44:00]  You know, I would not  It sounds, you know, recordable  I don't know  But the embarrassing part is that it was ever me  But see, what honestly  What makes it worse is that  30  Yes  30 fucking years have gone by  If you were in the moment in the early 80s  Okay  We'd still be beating you up  But  If I was still trying  Put it this way  If I was still trying to make it  Doing this music  Then just fucking hang me with my multicolored belts  That would be sad 
[02:44:30]  That would be sad  Yeah  But I mean  I had to search out  My buddy Joe Curry  To find this on a cassette tape  In a box of shit  Literally shit  And a transfer  I mean  This shit is just part of  What was going on  Even though you were talentless  You were driven  At least you  I had to do something  Down on the track  I didn't just  In  And install above the ground swimming pools  Can I put the bat signal out for Coke Logic  Oh for what?  Make a video? 
[02:45:00]  I think we might need a video  If you can make an animated  I think we might need that there  Coke Logic  Yeah  Coke Logic on Twitter  Let's bother Coke Logic today  That would roll  We need a Dara fucking video  Animation actually  Yeah  One more Dara  This is good  Only halfway through the song  Oh thank God  We could have a fine romance 
[02:45:30]  Fine  Fine  How's your romance?  Fine  Yeah  That was the original title of the movie  That Tarantino wrote  Fine romance  Oh God 
[02:46:00]  You know what you are?  You're killing me  You are a drip  What a wet end  Oh God damn  How's your romance?  I clicked in  You know Dara's close to  60 probably  Gives a shit  Mid to late 50s  Mid to late 50s  Yeah  With no teeth  Yeah  And  You're going to Hollywood dog  I've heard better sounds 
[02:46:30]  In a  Better sounds  In a paint toilet  Dara became a hoarder  Yes  I picture people with mullets and fanny packs dancing to this  Yeah  Anyone who's been dumped by a girl named Dara is really  This is going to resonate  Oh God  Look  I fucking warned you that it was really bad  To bet it wasn't 40 years earlier you could have been singing O'Clara  Maybe Phil Rizzuto would have signed up  Because that was his stupid wife's name 
[02:47:00]  How many times are we going to hear that in a fucking Yankee broadcast?  Boo Phil  Oh God  This is so bad  I can't take it  It's only proper that you suffer  I guess that's it  I'm joking  I liked it  Oh no  There's more  Is this where we got to get our lighters out? 
[02:47:30]  Are you singing with a clenched fish and your eyes closed all fucking emotional?  And I have the mic stand rocked back at about a 45 degree angle  Oh God  Horrible  I'm clenching my fist and fucking like  Oh God  Oh Dara 
[02:48:00]  You smarmy bag of douche  It's horrible  You never met Dara  Fuck Dara  I know  There is no Dara  She's some drunk trying to get into a club  Danny just put up the final scene of the breakfast club  A breakfast club  Yeah  Yeah  With the fist raised in the air  Oh how awful was that?  Speaking of awful  My opening act this weekend  John O'Rourke  John O'Rourke  Johnny O'Rourke  No a very fine performer  He's on the bill with me  He'll be singing Dara  I promised him a plug  He will be singing Dara  I'm telling you  Otto and George Comics at Foxwoods

[02:49:00]  Send your love my way  I'm sure we'd have a fine romance  I'd have more respect for you  If you said  Take out your cock  I'm going to drop my underpants  Someone's saying  In this day and age  I should sing O'Hara's  That was a good one  I missed your name  I'm sorry 
[02:49:30]  Oh my God  O'Hara's  O'Hara's  The instant feedback  And the Twitter  Is spinning like a slot machine  Right now  The amount of feedback  Coming in  Look I told you  Can't even keep up with it  I warned you  I prefaced it  And still  I can't take it  I am  I am fucking  So hot  I'll say  You were back then too  With lyrics like that  I'll say though  Honestly though  Like if she had  Sent her romance his way  Honestly it probably 
[02:50:00]  Would have been  A fine romance  If O'Hara  Why?  I can't wait  You could be celebrating  Your 30th  Your 30th wedding anniversary  With O'Hara  Yeah  With a house full of  Fucking shit  Yeah  And she'd see what  Your love was all about  You know  She sent her love your way  Cause endless days  Equals sleepless nights  And fates a dealer  And a fine romance  You're really  Picking up on the lyrics  Oh yeah  Actually Dara would have  Divorced you  And taken all your  As is money  All my as is cash
