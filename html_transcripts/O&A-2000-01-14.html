[04:30]
 yeah  and Major Leone  for trying to now  take cars away  from drivers like myself  wha  did you hear this one  what happened  can you explain it to the people  if he wants to  in how he repossesses your car. Now if you're caught doing double the speed limit, you're  going to repossess your car on the spot. So like me and you and all the guys at LIE doing  about 100 on the shoulder.  You know, I want to like this damn guy. I'll admit it, I want to like him but he just makes  it so freaking difficult. 
[05:00]
 That's insane. You cannot take away cars. Now you know what, we said this with the drunk  driving. Someone gets caught driving drunk, they take your car away before you're convicted  or anything. They just take your car. And everyone was saying, oh it's a great idea.  And we were saying, it's just a step to taking away your car for something else. And now  it's this. You know what's going to get to the point? If you're parking in a no parking  zone, we'll tow your car and you will never ever get it back again.  Don't laugh man, that's how it starts. It always starts this way. 
[05:30]
 We're giving away too many of our freedoms in this country.  So double the speed limit?  You're just taking your car away to speed limit?  Wait, if you're doing double the speed limit?  You're doing some boring news today.  Does this mean 60 in a 30?  I guess so.  I've done that.  No, the only way they say it is reckless driving. And then they ask the definition of reckless  driving and they say switching three lanes.  Oh that's one example? Oh so even switching three lanes?  Yeah, you could do reckless driving.  Oh come on, I do that all the time. There's some ass wipe in the left and middle lane. 
[06:00]
 You've got to switch.  You've got to go all the way around.  I'm not talking about the trooper's discretion.  You know why doesn't the mayor wake up and get all these unlicensed, uninsured drivers  off the road before they start effing with us?  Yeah, get the NDSR and the F-Line doing 50.  I mean there are some serious problems on the roadways. There's so many people out there  right now that could get into a nasty accident with you and you're not going to get a cent.  I know.  Because they're uninsured, unlicensed, don't even own the car they're driving because they  stole it.  Gypsy cabs. 
[06:30]
 Gypsy cabs, all that crap. Take care of all that before you start taking more of our freedoms  away.  Why not just put all our cars on tracks like the Disneyland, what is that, the Autotopia?  Remember that where you just go, ahhhh. Like little five year olds smelling exhaust fumes  in that pit.  Oh, you're kidding me.  And it's on a track and you can't go fast. That'd make him happy. He doesn't have to  worry about it. Wherever he goes, there's sirens blaring and he's in a limousine or  something, one of those trucks. 
[07:00]
 He's doing 90 miles an hour.  Yeah, he's doing 90. So he doesn't know how to drive this type of traffic. Let him in  his goddamn comb-over, sit on the 59th street bridge and not drive on the sidewalk.  Oh, let's thank the fucking hotel.  That would have got my car taken away, but goddamn I was so proud of that move. I drove  on the sidewalk.  We bow to you, Ant. We had your moves, but...  We had to make it to a...  Next time that happens, your car will be taken away.  Yeah, now the cars wouldn't be taken away.  Alright, Mike, thank you.  Is that a train?  Alright, you did a good job, Ant. 
[07:30]
 I wonder if that move where I backed down the one-way street so my car was facing the  right way but I'm driving the wrong way backwards to get to Goldfinger's. Remember that one?  I wonder if that would be a confiscating offense.  That was one of the most... We had so much fun that night, man. I looked in the rear  view mirror, I just saw Earl and he had turned white. He looked like that scene in The Little  Rascals where Steinme got scared and his eyes got big and white. He was like, whoa! 
[08:00]
 That was Earl. He was petrified at my driving. I was on the sidewalk.  I'm just sitting there, Earl, relax. I'm used to this. If I'm not scared, you shouldn't  be scared. I've been driving with this guy for five years.  I'm going to have to watch myself now.  You know what, though? I swear, I want to like Rudy Giuliani. I'm not going to lie.  I want to like him, but every time you turn around or open the paper, he's doing something  that just gets you pissed off.  Yeah. I mean, this is too far. Come on. 
[08:30]
 Here's Joanne. Look, I knew someone would call with this. Go ahead, Joanne.  Hello? Hi.  Hi. I was just listening to you yesterday and I just think it's funny the way you are  bashing Giuliani today and you're crazying him so much yesterday.  Oh my God. You didn't listen yesterday, did you?  And you didn't listen today? I didn't say... We're not bad.  What I said was... No, Joanne, what I said, though, seriously, without getting all bad...  Oh my God. That was a big one. 
[09:00]
 Joanne, listen. What I said was, I want to like this guy so badly, but every time you  turn around, he's doing something that just pisses you off. And yesterday, we said, for  the most part, he's doing a good job, but he does piss a lot of people off. And there  are things that he does that pisses me off, one of which yesterday we said was not maybe  tossing a few extra bucks to the cops. And now there's this thing. What do you think?  If we like him overall, we have to like everything he does? 
[09:30]
 No, I understand that. Overall, I think he's been a decent mayor for New  York, but he comes up with some hair-brained schemes.  No, I know. I live in Queens and I listen to you guys every day and I do listen to you  yesterday. How about Rudy confiscating Joanne's mouth?  That would be good for reckless talking. Yeah, could you get a club on your...  Yeah, you need a club.  Hey, that's not nice.  I'm sorry, Joanne, but you seem to babble a lot. If you only understood what we went  through before we went on the air today. Does your boyfriend or something or husband... 
[10:00]
 My boyfriend, my old boyfriend was a policeman and I know what he had to go through and I  know how little money he got. What was more dangerous, him patrolling or  sitting in a conversation with you? Because I got to tell you something. I bet a lot of  times he was like, huh? What? I bet he forgot a lot of stuff that you told him.  Anthony, that's so mean. Why? You just seem to talk right over  me. Joanne, if I could speak for my pal today,  he's a little angry today. How do I know? I've cried before. 
[10:30]
 You're going to hear a lot of angry comments. I've been called one time.  I've blown up the opposite sex today. That's all I can say.  No, I'm not blaming the entire opposite sex. Okay, but I don't want Joanne going away kind  of bummed at Anthony because he's a little hypersensitive today when it comes to females.  No, I'm fine with females. What happened?  I'm really fine with females. Can we talk about it?  I love you, girl. Can we talk about it? Is there something wrong?  No, everything's fine. I wake up in the morning with a big smile on my face, man. 
[11:00]
 Every morning I wake up now and go, ah, the air smells a little fresher.  It's just, it's a beautiful new day. A sarcasm, I can feel it.  I can smell it. No, that's the God's honest truth.  There's no sarcasm in that statement. Joanne, getting back to the Rudy thing really fast.  Okay. If you have been following our discussion over the months about Rudy Giuliani,  we don't like Rudy or Hillary. We wish there was a third candidate for the Senate.  Oh, to be honest with you, Rudy. But if I had a vote tomorrow, 
[11:30]
 I would definitely vote for the mayor. But I would be completely happy with my decision.  I do want to like the guy, but the guy turns around and does stupid things left and right.  Well, you know, it's like the city is his to do with what he wants.  He'd do something for the Yankees in a second, but for the police, he wouldn't.  It's something that, you know, I live in New York. I live in Queens, so I know.  I mean, I think he's done a great deal of good for the way everything has gotten better, 
[12:00]
 but he hasn't really taken any other issue instead of taking credit for himself.  And that's something that I don't like necessarily.  People that are in power tend to do that. You know, something good is up to them.  Something bad is somebody else's fault. And that's the part about him I don't really like.  He'll move Yankees to one side, closer to where they need to be.  Oh, my God!  Joyeux!  Joyeux! 
[12:30]
 Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Joyeux!  Oh, my God. All I saw were entrails and a red mist.  I didn't even see it coming. Did you, Ant?  No.  Didn't even see that one coming.  Those Apaches, man, they could target you from behind a hill, pop up and fire.  My God.  I love the smell of napalm in the afternoon.  Wow.  Smells like... 
[13:00]
 First airstrike of the day.  All right, let's move on. We got to...  Sometimes you got to call in air support.  Ant, we got a phone call from Boston on the line.  Hello, Bastin. Craig?  Yeah.  Craig?  I heard you guys had a station out here.  What do you mean?  You just said on the radio that you are syndicated out here.  You have a station that you're on?  We're... Well, one of the fine radio stations up there in Boston  has decided to start playing some of our fine radio bits.  Oh, my God. 
[13:30]
 You're slowly re-entering the Boston market.  Right.  I was heartbroken when you guys left.  I live in Greenfield, Massachusetts.  Yeah.  And I used to listen to you guys all the time.  You guys killed me.  Cool.  Yes.  Oh, it was awesome.  Well, we're coming back slowly but surely, Craig.  Great. Great.  So tune in the WBCN up there.  WBCN, all right.  All right.  Another thing, that's the best bit you guys have ever done.  I had to pull over.  I was laughing so hard.  The 100 grand bit.  Oh, we love the 100 grand bit. 
[14:00]
 Oh, my God.  I got a piece of crap, Jugg.  I'm going to get a new one.  I'm going to get a new truck.  Craig, you haven't heard us in a couple of years, man.  We got stuff that makes that look like college radio.  I've been listening to you guys.  I've been working down in Newark.  Oh, cool.  There you go.  Yeah.  So I've been listening to you guys every day.  You guys are killing me.  Ah, thanks, Craig.  So funny.  Well, have a great weekend.  All right.  Thanks, man.  Have a good one, guys.  Bye, man.  Bye.  Another call coming in from Boston.  Mike.  Hey, what's up?  You've been waiting for like a half hour. 
[14:30]
 What's going on?  Not much.  What's going on?  I heard you guys are coming out here now.  Where are you calling from?  I'm calling from Boston.  What part?  I'm calling from like Everett.  Everett.  Cool.  Everett.  I go to Boston.  We're slowly but surely making our way back into the Boston market there, Mike.  Mike, have you heard some of the stuff on BCN?  Yeah.  I keep hearing things like back and forth between the two radio stations,  wondering what happened in the first place that you guys left.  Are they fighting over us right now?  No, not really.  I just called up the radio stations.  I was talking to them and BCN didn't really have much to say. 
[15:00]
 When I was talking to someone at AAF, they told me that you guys actually got fired by CBS when  they owned you.  That's not really true.  It's boring to the New York audience, but basically we're going up against the station  that fired us now in Boston.  Yeah.  That's it.  So it's a big, huge story up there.  Really?  I thought it was CBS owned you guys and that's when they fired you and then they sold out AAF  because they couldn't own both radio stations.  Nope.  We were fired by WAF and the company that owned them.  They're trying to cover their ass now because after two years of sitting back and just being 
[15:30]
 quiet, we've decided we want back in the Boston market because we left a couple million of you  guys behind and you guys deserve the chance to hear us.  We vowed we'd be back.  I think that's cool and everything, but I mean most of the people over there are still  your friends and stuff.  A couple of people.  A few of them, sure.  None of them have really called since we left.  The whole story will come out eventually.  But don't believe everything you hear.  So what are they going to do, like a syndication type of thing? 
[16:00]
 We can't say much right now.  All I can say is BCN has started playing our bits.  All right, bro.  Bye.  That's a huge story up there.  We should get the radio station we're on.  Yeah.  We should call them today because it's huge.  Why don't we do that?  Because what happened was we were WAF up there.  Yeah.  We worked for AAF up in the Boston area, actually the Worcester, Boston area.  It was a lot like this situation.  We were pretty much the only show that people were listening to. 
[16:30]
 Right.  A lot of.  Right.  And then we were like number one by far, kicking ass in the ratings.  We were the hottest show in Boston.  I mean by far.  No one came close to us.  And then we thought we were untouchable.  So there was an April Fool's little prank we did where we decided to  tell everyone the mayor died in a car accident while he was on vacation in Florida.  Oops.  And we're like, hey, come on.  Can't fire us for that.  Can't fire us for that.  Maybe they'll suspend us.  I mean look at all the money we're bringing in and the ratings we're giving this company. 
[17:00]
 And it's April Fool's.  Everyone knows it's a gag.  Well AAF.  No matter how tasteless.  WAF turns around and they completely fired us.  Fired us.  Poof.  And didn't want to know anything about us after they fired us.  And it's like, okay, it's the company so you don't have anything personal against some of the air staff.  The big fat bastard that was doing the night time show slips into our slot,  three to seven, like he was just waiting to pounce before we even got fired.  He was talking like, hey, if they're gone, let me jump in there. 
[17:30]
 So screw him.  Right.  We'll kick his ass.  So now we've decided we've had enough and we're coming back to Boston with our bits and stuff.  And maybe other things, right Ant?  Yes.  And it's so funny because now people are calling our show down here.  They can't even hear us live up there.  They're just hearing recorded stuff that we send up.  Yeah.  But they're just losing it in that town because it's a real big story that we go back up there  and go on the competition, the competitors station.  Oh, I know. 
[18:00]
 WBCN.  But the fact is they've been really, really nice to us ever since we got fired.  They've been cool, you know, and all our supposedly old pals and friends from the other station,  they didn't want to know us after we got fired.  No.  So screw them.  Well, what we'll do is we'll get Boston on the line later on,  see how the bits are being played up there and stuff called Boston.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's play the 100 grand thing that that guy was talking about.  It's a favorite.  We gave away 100 grand of the company's money. 
[18:30]
 Well, it wasn't money.  You'll understand in a minute.  Stay there.  Hi.  Hi.  Who's this?  Hey, it's Craig from Waltham.  Hey, Craig, guess what?  Oh, did I win?  You are the 107th call.  100 and 7.  No, I don't know why.  Did I?  Damn it, I won.  I won.  I know why you're kidding, right?  107.  107th call, congratulations.  100 grand, oh my God.  You just won 100 grand, bro.  Oh, Jesus.  Do you know what I'm going to do with that?  What are you going to do with 100 grand?  The first thing, I have this old, oh, I cannot. 
[19:00]
 Jesus, I got to calm down.  Calm yourself.  I am the winner.  I'm the winner.  Well, what are you going to do with 100 grand?  I got this, oh, man, I got this for a truck.  I've got to get a new truck.  Oh, that.  Wait, wait, dude.  How are you going to do that with a candy bar?  What?  How are you going to do that with a candy bar?  We just gave you a 100 grand candy bar.  What do you mean?  We gave away 100 grand.  No.  It's a candy bar, bro.  Congratulations.  What?  You just won a candy bar. 
[19:30]
 Hey, what the f***?  You've been, I've been listening to f***ing radio for like three hours, man.  You said 100 grand.  Yeah, 100 grand.  We gave you a candy bar.  That's a candy bar.  Congratulations, buddy.  Oh, you guys are a bunch of useless.  Hey, hey, hey.  Congratulations, man.  Uh-oh.  We found a girl that can shoot stuff from a private area.  More stupidity on the way.  1027 WNEW. 
[20:00]
 1027 WNEW.  It's FU Friday with Opie and Anthony and Big FU going out to the rock.  Yeah.  The croc.  The rock says.  The croc says.  Where's our rock song?  Yeah.  We gotta play our rock songs.  Phyllis is very pissed at us.  Phyllis, what's wrong?  Oh, hello.  Am I live?  Yeah, you're live, Phyllis.  You guys were yelling at Joanne there, giving her a hard time. 
[20:30]
 Yeah.  And that pisses you off.  Oh, you guys talk over everybody.  Well, we talk over people when it's getting boring because we gotta move on with the show.  People don't find it interesting when a lady says yapping, yapping, yapping.  What happened, Anthony?  Did you get served with papers today?  Oh, oh.  I might not be able to discuss that right away.  Hello.  Is the caller there?  Right now.  Hello? Hello?  What happened to Phyllis?  She was just asking a question.  I know, but what happened?  I think something's wrong with the phone, Ant. 
[21:00]
 Buddy, what do you think?  You won't be hearing any corky Anthony over here.  You got When the Saints Come Marching In?  It's like a fun, happy song.  Yeah, we could get that.  Oh, you're doing the funky version. 
[21:30]
 Oh, yeah.  Where they add notes and stuff.  You ever hear that?  Brian, what's up?  Hey, open Anthony.  Hey.  What's happening, man?  How's it going, man?  All right.  Anthony, I saw you last night at Governor's.  Governor's?  Yep. You gave me your autograph.  I gotta say, your class act, that was really, really cool of you.  You guys were class act.  I was in a very good mood.  Adam, what a pisser he is, huh?  He was great.  The guy killed it.  He might have found me a little bit, but it wasn't that bad.  I was the communications guy.  Communications guy, yeah. 
[22:00]
 Yeah, but the lady over to the side of us got it bad.  She got ripped on.  Because she was being like an antelope, she kept...  Yeah, she was first...  Because Adam works the crowd and stuff pretty well.  And he had this girl there, and she wouldn't tell him what job she did.  No.  And then it turns out she was with the Society for American Values or something.  Some homo group or something like that.  Yeah.  Oh.  And then did you see Adam on News 12 this morning?  No, I missed that.  I was trying to watch it, but I couldn't get it at the right time.  See, the chick was nice to Adam.  The chick was really cool to Adam.  And then the guy, when the guy got on, he was some frigging loser. 
[22:30]
 He just kept bugging.  He kept raking on Adam's jokes and stuff like that.  Like what?  It was horrible.  What was he bashing him about?  I don't know.  Adam tried to do some material, and he was just like, oh, yeah, that's funny.  Ah.  With a straight face.  He totally ruined it.  But the chick was into it.  The chick wanted to give him a hummer, I think.  Because he's a news guy.  News guys don't have a sense of humor.  Please.  You go to Gov'n, and you see Adam just destroy the crowd.  Because the room wasn't packed last night.  Not at all.  And he had the place going wild. 
[23:00]
 It was great.  The Friday, Saturday, and Sunday shows are usually on.  They're going to be more packed, because it was a Thursday night.  Man, I suggest you go to Gov'n and see Adam.  He's a pisser.  All right.  Yeah, thanks a lot, guys.  Thank you, bro.  Rob, thanks for listening.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  Bye-bye.  We got the croc songs, Anthony.  The croc.  You want to hear the hypocrite rock song from Heirsic Productions, Anthony?  Yeah, that one's good.  All right, this came in yesterday.  Check this out. 
[23:30]
 The boy had changed the rock's tone.  And he really pissed off this happy Simone.  The way he laughed was a real big shock.  With tears running down the face of the rock.  Everybody thinks this whole thing's a croc.  But you must remember he's dumber than mankind's stock. 
[24:00]
 Well, the rockman we've been close of had trance-lin,  and something got the rock beat.  Someone had to tell him about me, because I doubt the rock can read.  Oh, you thought you fooled us?  That ain't no can.  You look like a cro-magnon man.  But you hypocrite rock, you have lost some fans.  What?  Where, where, where, where, where?  Help me.  Where, where, where, where, where? 
[24:30]
 What a freaking cry, baby, the rock was.  Walking out on our show, lads.  The rock.  The croc says.  Please.  The croc says, Tom, you're next on the OVN Anthony show on WNW.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  I wanted to say, we got a little bit more about that Giuliani story with the cars.  I'm right with you guys.  I want to like the guy.  But at the same time, he's pulled out on five different offenses.  It was like if you get caught tailgating twice, they're taking your car away. 
[25:00]
 And there's certain places on the west side of the highway,  you're running, you know, on the side.  Uh-oh.  But for sure.  But like, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, Tom, it's gonna answer you in the same,  the same way you asked your question.  Yeah, I did that.  I think it's about something that I can tell you like with the back of your finger.  But you.  And Tom's phone hung up.  Tom, call back your cell phone crap down on us.  But it's a very scary thing.  It's very unacceptable. 
[25:30]
 Yeah.  This whole new Rudy thing confiscating cars if you're going,  what, twice the speed limit and things like that.  Yeah.  Unacceptable.  We don't like it.  No one likes it.  I mean, no one should like it.  I love the rubé they find that always says, I think it's a good idea.  It'll get the maniacs off the road.  That's the person that makes you into a maniac.  That person, they don't know how to drive two miles an hour.  You try to pass them and you wind up looking like a maniac.  And now there's a risk of losing your car. 
[26:00]
 Yeah.  Oh, we'll all just ride big wheels into Manhattan.  We'll all be on our little big wheels.  Everyone will be safe.  All right.  You want another rock song, Anthony?  Yeah, sure.  Also from Air Sick Productions.  It's very short, but very funny.  Here it is.  The 
[26:30]
 look how brave we are now that he's gone.  Yeah, I know.  Ron, what's up?  Hey, ONA, listen, Dwayne's of course.  Dwayne Johnson.  Liam, my buddy Chaney, my buddy Major, we got signs made up.  We're going to be sitting front row, Madison Square Garden,  and say, ONA kicked the rock's Rudy Poe Chaney air.  Yeah.  All right.  Because he is a ham-breed wannabe wimp. 
[27:00]
 Don't forget he had fat sucked out of his man breasts.  He had the fat sucked out of every part of his sissy body.  He got that liposuction.  They sucked the big fat man breast right off his chest.  You know, when he was nothing, he was a lot more humble.  You guys got to stop giving idiots like him the exposure,  because you know, these guys, they get big,  and they forget why they got big.  Well, we were taken, I guess.  We've had some good experiences with some of the wrestlers.  You know, Chris Jericho gave a great interview.  Chris Jericho is a great guy. 
[27:30]
 Great interview.  Even the Road Dog, the second time we had him on.  A lot of fun we had with him.  Al Snow was a pisser, hysterical.  Doesn't take himself too seriously, like the croc.  Let's not forget Shane and Vince.  Shane and Vince have always been fun.  They too don't take themselves all that seriously.  They know it's a big gag.  You're a joke.  You're in wrestling.  We're a joke.  We're a couple of adults that just talk on the radio.  We understand that.  We don't take ourselves seriously.  But the Rock, all of a sudden, now the Rock has a racial, political agenda. 
[28:00]
 Rock, you're a dopey, big, doofus wrestler with a stupid closing move.  And why didn't you tell him this?  He's going to forget what he did.  Well, I had other things on my mind.  All right, Ron, thank you.  You're all brave now, but he's 10 feet away.  You couldn't say any of that stuff.  Fear for my life.  While he's here, I had to sleep on it.  That's what it was.  I had to mull it over.  I wonder if we would do it differently. 
[28:30]
 If he walked in now, knowing what we know?  Hell yeah.  If we just went in the time capsule or the time machine  and were transported back and didn't know anything,  I think it would end up the same way.  Because we wouldn't know.  But if he walked in right now, I'd get up, I'd run away as fast as I could.  Walt.  Yeah?  What's up?  Oh, never mind.  He went out.  I forget where I went.  I stood signing from the Rock.  Yeah.  Say, hey, here's John Opie and Anthony.  I wouldn't sign his book. 
[29:00]
 He wouldn't sign your book?  Not my book, my friend's book.  Really?  Yeah.  It just proves he's a crybaby.  You got to be honest, he looks like he's Bigelow on steroids.  Yeah, that's pretty funny.  He does.  That's very good.  All right, man.  All right, Walt.  Doctor, take that liposuction tube, shine it up real nice,  turn that sumbitch sideways, and suck the fat out of my man breast, you candy ass.  Bob. 
[29:30]
 Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  You know how you're talking about the, you're just saying how he got the fat sucked out of his breast?  Sure.  That's not what he had done.  He had an operation, he had lumps taken out around his...  Well, we talked meatloaf and fight club.  Yeah, exactly from the movie.  He said it was liposuction, but it wasn't liposuction,  because I had the same thing done,  and he's got to lay off the sustenance and the D balls and all the other crap that was going. 
[30:00]
 We can't come.  That's where his anger management, remember how he has an anger problem?  Well, there you go, it's from the juice.  All right, Bob.  It's one of the number one symptoms.  Thank you.  All right, guys, burn in hell.  All right, bye.  We can't really confirm what Bob's saying, obviously.  Of course not.  That's what Bob thinks.  Okay.  They always speculate that wrestlers are on steroids.  They always speculate, that's okay.  You know what bums me out?  I was reading a lot of email, a lot of people think you and I are a bunch of pussies,  how we handle the rock thing and stuff. 
[30:30]
 I know, I understand.  I can see how people would get that impression, tell you the truth.  But we were just trying to explain ourselves and be courteous, you know?  Right.  The rock is in our home over here and we have to be courteous.  Mike?  What's up?  How are you?  What's up, guys?  At the very beginning of SmackDown last night, I don't know if you guys saw, but just for a second.  Don't watch wrestling.  I'm sorry.  And someone called me a crybaby yesterday.  All right, then I'm a crybaby.  Don't watch it. 
[31:00]
 Don't even like it anymore.  Hate it.  Well, who cares, Cactus Jack?  He's coming back.  When the camera went on, the first thing I saw, the first time I saw it said, Opie.  Oh, really?  I couldn't say what it said, but just for a second, flashed across.  Then I saw one that said, Rocky sucks.  Right.  You guys are getting support out there.  Well, we definitely want a lot of Opie and Anthony and Rock sucks.  You know, use your imagination.  A bunch of those signs for the pay-per-view on Sunday.  I'll be there.  You know, it's right at the garden.  You can just hold up the signs and, you know, even Razz the Rock. 
[31:30]
 Everyone cheers when he comes out.  You don't have to be a puppet and go along with the crowd.  The Rock says, all of a sudden, everyone, woo, woo.  Boo him.  Boo the Samoan.  Boo man.  I think this is the first pay-per-view I'm not going to buy.  Well, just so turned off.  Big F for you to the Rock.  All right.  Take it easy.  Bye.  You're all brave now.  What?  I'm all brave now.  You're right, because the Rock's not here.  If he was here, I'd be a little pussy girl.  You would?  But right now, I'll say the Rock's a pussy and I'll kick his ass. 
[32:00]
 Come on, Dwayne Johnson.  Don't you want a second shot at him, though, and come on.  For the Intercontinental Belt?  No, I don't want a second shot at him.  You don't care.  I just want to see some of our faithful fans give him a little razzing at the garden.  I would love to see that.  But you wouldn't want a second shot?  No.  You sure?  Why?  Is he coming?  Is the Rock coming in?  When's he coming? 
[32:30]
 Today?  Is the Rock coming in today?  Is he out there?  Is the Rock here?  Why did I say a half hour ago?  I had surprises.  I said there's many surprises for today's show.  Come on in, Rock.  I'll kick your ass.  Swear to God, Ann has no clue.  Is the Rock here?  The whole freaking office knows, but you don't.  I figured I would tell you live in the air today.  Dude, I have enough surprises today.  I know.  If you start showing up so I don't have to do all this wheeling and dealing by myself, 
[33:00]
 you'd be informed before the radio show.  Oh, sorry.  I'm talking to lawyers all day.  Is the Rock coming in today?  Well, Anthony?  What?  Don't jerk me around.  Come on.  You would have totally told me to shut up when I'm saying some of the stuff I'm saying.  No, I wouldn't.  Kill me.  No, come on.  We are rolling tape, though.  Stop.  You're freaking, aren't you?  Don't be an ass.  The Rock says.  No way. 
[33:30]
 Is the Rock coming in today?  Are you going to be a pussy the next time he comes in?  That's all I need to know.  I didn't say I wasn't going to be a pussy.  I said, yeah, I'll be a pussy when he comes in.  You will be?  Of course.  He'll be right here in front of my face.  I just say this stuff behind his back like a little worm.  What?  What's going on?  Come on.  Everyone knows except you.  Everyone knows what?  Yes, Anthony, the Rock is coming back on our show.  When?  Swear to God. 
[34:00]
 When?  I worked it out today.  When?  Next Thursday.  Swear not today.  Holy smoke.  I thought he was outside.  I swear to God.  Like, how am I going to explain big man breast?  We still have the tape.  I'm going to play.  Oh, stop.  Come on, man.  Good.  Then pull some of what you were saying, Mr. Brave Guy.  I didn't say anything wrong.  Oh, bull crap.  Did not say a thing, Anthony.  The WWF personally called us today. 
[34:30]
 Did I tell you how that people's elbow is probably the most electrifying  in sports entertainment?  Did the WWF call today?  Swear to you.  What did they say?  Well, it wasn't a pretty interview.  It wasn't a pretty call.  Yeah.  Because I was just saying, look, man, we're really pissed off.  Yeah.  You guys dissed us, man.  Uh-huh.  And they just said they wouldn't take responsibility.  They didn't apologize.  They didn't take responsibility.  They said nothing.  All they said was, well, do you guys want another shot? 
[35:00]
 Oh.  Swear to you.  Another shot at the rock like we're going to fight now.  It's a handicap match.  We're handicapped.  Or we'll be handicapped when he's done with us.  That was a great idea to have the rock come back.  I don't remember my name.  And I drew all the time.  When I calmed down.  The rock is coming back next Thursday.  All right.  It's going to be in town for a book signing.  And I swear, I am shaking as much as you. 
[35:30]
 And because that's all I know.  Swear to you, Ann.  Will Sickboy be joining us?  No.  But they said he'll discuss it further.  Really?  He'll discuss it further live on our show.  We're going to play any songs for him?  Come on, big man.  What songs?  You're trying to get me in trouble?  What songs?  Come on, big man.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Come on.  Is he going to get to you?  Rocks a pussy.  The rocks a pussy.  I don't know what you're talking about. 
[36:00]
 All right.  I think.  Oh, well.  I wonder what this is.  What?  Huh?  Oh, yeah.  Remember this?  Oh.  Half screen.  He's retarded.  The rocks a pussy.  Oh, boy.  Ann.  Oh, boy.  Let's lose this CD.  If you're smart, we're dead. 
[36:30]
 Dude, like he won't know that we were playing this.  I couldn't back down though.  The WWF's calling and I'm like, look, Ann and I are really pissed off.  And I told them that.  I don't watch anymore stuff.  And they're like, you guys still coming to the grand opening?  We're like, no, we're not going to the grand opening of the WWF.  Come on.  Pull my invitation.  I want to go.  Really?  I don't care.  What do you think?  I have like some kind of scruples on the things where it's like, oh, at a principal, I'm not going.  It's a party.  It'll be food, booze, and broads. 
[37:00]
 I'm there.  But we got to get our info together.  Yeah.  We got to do our research.  Tom, what's up?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yo, you better like broadcast from the other studio when the rocks in there or something.  Maybe we could do that.  We'll lock the door and have the rock go in this studio.  Or else even better.  You remember when they used to have those cage matches when they'd have Jimmy Hart hanging  from the top of Madison Square Garden in the cage?  Yeah.  You better damn well put the rock up in that cage.  Tom, I am freaking.  You guys, I don't know.  Honestly, I wanted to back down today. 
[37:30]
 But I'm like, man, I wouldn't forgive myself if we back down.  I don't even know if there's going to be any words.  Gee, thanks for consulting me.  I had to back down in a second.  You weren't around.  I didn't know what to do.  Wait, what was I?  I swear to God, I did not know what to do.  I'm like, you know, I was brave and stuff on the phone.  Like, you got disto.  He's an idiot.  We were blindsided.  He walked out.  He's a crybaby.  And they didn't apologize.  They didn't explain themselves.  All they said was, well, do you want another shot?  I want another shot.  And you said yes. 
[38:00]
 And if you want it, he'll come in this Thursday to discuss it further.  There's not even going to be any words between you guys.  I wrote it on our board in the office, Ant.  And I'm like, no, I got to tell Ant live on the air today.  Got to tell Ant live.  You beat me a little so I start ragging on the rock to get tape on me.  Of course I did.  You suck, man.  Are you still going to do that thing where you're not going to come in  when Anthony calls in sick that day?  Yeah.  Hell yeah.  I hope he comes in on Wednesday. 
[38:30]
 You should do that.  Tell him that.  All right, Tom.  Thank you.  Take care, guys.  We might have to play the phone game with him where we make him talk from the phone upstairs,  make sure he's not going to kill us, and then we'll have him come down.  Dude, you saw how he left the studio.  I know.  How pissed off he was.  See, you know what the thing is?  Remember how we were always saying he should come in in character?  And he came in as Dwayne?  Yeah.  We're going to force him to get into character because he's going to beat the crap out of us 
[39:00]
 as the rock.  Know what I'm going to get?  I can get you one, too.  You know those huge self-defense outfits like the ladies wear for rape prevention?  Oh, or when they're training attack dogs in big foam rubber suits?  Yeah.  We'll get a couple of those.  Or the big sumo wrestling suits.  He might find that offensive.  You're trying to say you're the rock?  Oh, boy.  That's going to be frightening, man.  I couldn't back down, though. 
[39:30]
 I wanted to because I was like, oh, a little scratchy throat.  But I'm not feeling too well.  You guys have got to play one of those songs, The Rock Comes In,  or You're the Biggest Pussies in New York.  I don't know what songs you're talking about.  Oh, Christ.  Dude, you guys are so yellow right now it's glowing.  Shut up.  Come on, Anthony.  You didn't see how big he is, though, man. 
[40:00]
 All right, so bring a few armed guards in.  We got to do what you got to do.  Maybe we could distract him by maybe a theme day on that day.  We could have movie day and maybe show a screening of Nigger Charlie.  Maybe that's why it's a real movie from the 70s.  We played the trailer.  Tony.  Yeah, I got to say, if you were used to.  Why?  You've had him all over again.  That's all I'm saying.  All this stuff he's talking about. 
[40:30]
 Now he's going to come back in.  He's both going to be pussies.  Like we'll we'll piss you out and and kiss his ass.  Exactly.  Just like Letterman.  Wait, let me tell you something.  I mean, just to have him come back in the studio, we're not we're not that much of.  No, let me tell you.  We're not pussying around that much.  I'll unload.  I'll say it now.  I'll unload on him.  I'd stand there with a sign that says Rocky sucks.  I'd sit there in the studio with a big sign that says the rock sucks.  Just like that. 
[41:00]
 I'll give it to him.  That's not a bad idea.  We'll have a bunch of listeners around.  You know, I'm down there.  You know how they do that lumberjack match where they have all the wrestlers on the outside  of the ring.  So if one of the wrestlers falls out, they push him back in.  Yeah, we can have all our listeners around the perimeter of the studio with all signs  that say rocks are pussy.  I'll be the first one.  Oh, we could do that.  Yeah, I'll be the first one.  Big sign.  Rocky sucks.  All right, Tony.  All right.  Thank you.  Take it easy.  Bye.  Keith.  Hey, Keith.  Hey, what's up?  How are you doing? 
[41:30]
 We're freaking out.  Hey, you going to push down like you did with Dice Clay came on?  No, the dice thing was good.  We had fun with the dice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was pretty cool, but I think this rock definitely was.  We're going to the Royal Rumble.  We're going to bring a couple of signs.  Oh, cool.  Yeah.  We appreciate it.  Cool.  All right, man.  All right, dude.  Bye.  Bye.  But there you have it, Ant.  I'm telling you live in the air, you get another shot at the rock.  The rock.  This coming Thursday, a rematch.  I think it's going to be late in the show because he's doing a book signing. 
[42:00]
 Oh, is he?  Yeah.  Great.  That book.  You were freaked.  You were convinced he was outside that door today.  I was just waiting for it.  I had you going.  I was waiting to turn my head and see him walk in.  I was just going to crap myself.  I was really going to crap myself because it's one thing to say it,  you know, and then he shows up on Thursday and, you know, weeks gone by and everything.  But to be saying that and have him listening and then bust in with everything I was saying,  he'd have killed me.  And I was baiting you.  Totally.  I felt for it. 
[42:30]
 How could you take advantage of me and my weakened state, Opie?  You would do the same thing to me.  Who are you kidding?  Hell yeah.  All right, let's take a break.  We'll be back.  Opie and Anthony.  Jack, can we get these illiterates off the air, please?  We suck.  If I wasn't on it, I wouldn't listen.  1027 WNEW.  Anthony, Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  Oh, yeah.  People losing weight with Stacker 2 all the time and now you probably packed on a few pounds  for the holidays.  Good way to get rid of it.  Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner, Opie. 
[43:00]
 And if you were thinking of like starting Stacker 2 this weekend,  I would advise against it, believe it or not.  Yeah.  You're going to want to keep that extra layer of fat so when the rock punches you real hard,  it's not going to hurt as much.  Is that what it's all about?  Yeah.  I mean, for all our faithful listeners that don't have to confront the rock,  I think this is a good thing.  But I think you and I, we should not be taking Stacker 2 in the near future.  Ah.  We're going to need that layer of fat. 
[43:30]
 A layer of fat.  Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner, it does three things, Ant.  Yes, it is the world's strongest fat burner.  It crushes your cravings to snack during the day and it gives you a boost of energy.  That's right.  You feel yourself petering out toward the end of the day.  There you go.  And you'll lose weight.  There you go.  Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner, they have a website,  www.stacker2.com.  That's stackertwo.com or give them a call at 1-800-LIGHTLINE  That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E. 
[44:00]
 Start now and look great this spring with Stacker 2,  the world's strongest fat burner at 1-800-LIGHTLINE.  1027-W-N-A-W, it's the Opium Anthony show.  It's FU Friday, the easiest way to get your FUs in.  Through the fax machine, 212-957-9639.  All right?  All right.  And we got to congratulate Steve from the unofficial Opium Anthony website.  The unofficial website went over 1 million hits today.  A million. 
[44:30]
 1 million hits in a little over seven months, I believe.  Not bad.  Plenty of people checking that site out.  That's absolutely incredible.  And we want to congratulate Steve today.  That's a big milestone.  And it actually shows a million hits.  I thought it was going to go back to zero or something, you know?  Oh, really?  It shows, not like the old odometer on the car?  No, it's...  Back to zero on your little Dodge Dart?  It's kind of weird to say.  It's just over a million.  It hit a million hits right around showtime today.  All right. 
[45:00]
 Foundrymusic.com.  I think the boss is in Washington, the new one, so we can say it today.  Foundrymusic.com.  What are you laughing at?  We could say it today.  Yeah, why not?  Boss is out of town?  Yeah.  Is he?  Yeah.  All right, friend.  You know what to do.  Plan C3A.  Plan C3A.  Dave!  Yeah, what's up, guys?  We're losing you.  What?  We're losing you. 
[45:30]
 Yeah, man.  Where the hell are you going?  I'm going back to college, man.  Where?  In Washington.  Not in Washington, Maryland.  Oh, Maryland.  Yeah, you know why?  Because I broke my ankle at Thanksgiving.  And so I was home for like 10 weeks.  So I've just been listening to you ever since, you know?  But I've been listening to you from the beginning.  Oh, cool.  But, you know, it sucks.  I have to go back and I won't listen to you guys till May.  Know what's interesting about down there?  There's, you know, well, I can't name the station.  Damn it.  There's a station down there that wants to pick us up. 
[46:00]
 Really?  But the company thinks Aunt and I are too out of control.  We're out of control.  That's BS, man.  You boys get in control before we put you out over the wire.  That man, we got our interests to protect.  We like you boys.  We hope you succeed.  We want you to be syndicated in hundreds of stations on this company.  Yeah, I wish you guys...  But if you pull ads down one more time.  You know, if your buddies open and they weren't out of control,  you'd probably be going back to school listening to us.  If you guys weren't out of control, then, you know, I wouldn't be listening to you.  Yeah, exactly.  It's like a Catch-22. 
[46:30]
 Yeah.  If we weren't out of control, most of you guys wouldn't listen.  That's why we have to take this chance.  Yeah, we f up so much.  There's a bunch of stations just on hold waiting.  Really?  Waiting, waiting, waiting for CBS to pull the switch.  And they just, they are just convinced we are so out of control.  Yeah.  I'm just waiting for you guys to get syndicated and just blow Howard out of the water.  You know what I'm saying?  It's true, man.  I'm telling you.  But could you guys do me a favor?  Yeah, Dave.  Could you play that Chris Jericho interview?  Okay. 
[47:00]
 And one more thing, Anthony.  Yeah.  There's a lot of fishing to see, buddy.  Okay?  That's all right, man.  You guys are great.  All right, Dave.  Stay black.  Bye.  I guess Dave putting a couple of things together.  Tommy!  We'll have a contest later in the show.  Guess where Anthony lives now.  It'll be a contest.  Tommy, what's up?  I want to send a big F.U. out to my ex-wife and a lawyer,  a goddamn lawyer for Jack and me off in the past two years.  Oh, now come on.  Be sympathetic. 
[47:30]
 Oh, I'm sympathetic.  I got my papers back today.  They're signed, sealed, and delivered.  How much you lose?  About a thousand a month.  Yeah?  Yeah.  How much?  Not bad though.  It's worth it.  How much you miss?  What?  How much?  How much you make?  I'm sure not as much as Anthony.  But whatever it is, let me tell you, it's worth it to have your freedom.  Yeah?  And yeah.  And also, I just want to let her know that she's no longer covered under my benefits. 
[48:00]
 I just figured I had to call and get that across, you know?  All right, Tommy.  That's got to be nice writing that check every month, huh?  Actually, I have my girlfriend do it.  So that when she sees it, it's funnest we're even deeper.  God damn, that's funny.  Yeah, I make sure my girlfriend writes it so when she sees the signature,  it's like pouring acid on an open cut, you know? 
[48:30]
 Oh, cut.  Yeah.  Okay.  Write that one down there.  All right, Tommy.  Yeah, that's funny.  Don't worry about it.  All right.  Let me tell you something, Tommy.  Anthony is not worried about a thing.  Oh, I know.  I hear it.  Anthony is a happy man.  I hear it.  You won't hear Corky Stern over here.  Hells no.  All right, fellas.  I want to touch your Facebook.  You're doing great.  I called up about eight months ago when you were doing that Elvis guy on it. 
[49:00]
 Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's it.  I just want to say hello to the boys at Emory that are out there driving right now up and down the road.  Okay, Tommy.  And that's it.  Have a nice weekend, fellas.  You too, buddy.  Keep up the good work.  All right, man.  And all I have to say is you're taking this Howard Stern wannabe thing too extreme.  We'll be double dating, me and Howie down in the Bahamas.  We'll be on a jet ski together. 
[49:30]
 Yeah, right.  Let me tell you something.  Unlike Howard, you're not going to see me carousing around with a bunch of men.  That's for sure.  I spent time with the men here in the studio.  That's it.  That's it, pal.  My penis has been unlocked from nine years of tyranny.  Oh, my God.  This show is filled with surprises today. 
[50:00]
 I know how the slit my penis knows how the slaves felt when Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.  Wow.  Oh, boy.  Sean, you're next on the show.  How are you?  Hey, guys. What's up?  All right.  So you guys scared about The Rock coming in or what?  If you're just tuning in, we found out today The Rock is coming back next Thursday.  Yeah.  If you smell what's in Anthony's pants. 
[50:30]
 I don't know.  I will be honest with the guy.  I mean, what are we going to do?  We'll look like ass wipes if we just sit here and lap his butt.  We're going to have to speak to him about the things that were concerning us on that day.  And then he'll beat the crap out of us and it'll be over.  We have a lot of friends on the force, Anthony.  Yes.  I'm thinking bulletproof vest.  Some Kevlar strap on, some Kevlar.  Some Kevlar would be nice.  Yeah. 
[51:00]
 Hopefully, you will both be survivors.  Let me tell you, though.  If he hits you, like even just knocks you down,  you'd be able to have a concussion.  Yeah.  Can you see the size of him?  I know.  What about a football helmet for both of us?  Yeah, we'll be needing them afterwards, too, on the short bus.  Wearing a hockey helmet.  And then say, I'm okay.  I love The Rock.  We used to do it many years ago.  The Rock. 
[51:30]
 We're home is Anthony.  Jesus.  I'm screwed.  Hey, June.  Yes.  How are you?  Fine.  Good. What's up?  I just want to let you know that you guys are really crazy.  This Rock is intelligent.  He's a wonderful businessman.  He's got tons of fans.  A lot of women love him.  And he's got such a great following that I think for you to mock him like this,  you're really very jealous of him. 
[52:00]
 The guy is a great entertainer.  That must be it.  That's what it is.  The Rock comes on and you leave a trail like a slug.  Is that what happens, June?  You like The Rock, do you?  I love The Rock.  I think he's great.  I like The Rock.  I like Val Zinus.  I think those guys are talented.  And what about Dwayne Johnson?  You like him?  Oh, I love Dwayne Johnson.  Same guy.  It's The Rock.  No, it's not.  Sure it is.  The Rock is a fun guy who looks like he doesn't take himself seriously.  And June, those guys wouldn't give you the time of day. 
[52:30]
 Yeah, really?  Well, that's not what I'm looking for, though.  Oh, you're kidding.  You're basing your opinion on a character.  No, I'm basing my opinion on somebody that entertains me and somebody that I like.  And actually...  I like him because you're fantasizing about them like riding...  Hey, listen.  Don't you guys fantasize about women?  He's a great entertainer.  You want his schlong.  That's not what I want.  You want The Rock's rock.  No, that's not what I want.  I just think he's a great entertainer. 
[53:00]
 So we shouldn't be able to talk about him, right?  Excuse me?  So we shouldn't be able to talk about him?  I don't think you should.  Because you said so, June.  No, not because I said so.  I just think he's a really great guy and I think you guys are jealous of him.  Just a terrific guy.  Terrific human being.  He is a terrific human being.  A real man has a problem with someone.  What does he do?  He cries and walks away.  That's a real man.  Sure.  What a guy.  He's an entertainer, though, don't you think?  Great entertainer and a great businessman. 
[53:30]
 Oh, yeah, businessman.  How does he know about business?  Pardon me?  What does he know about business?  Look how much money he's made.  Look what a following he has.  June?  June?  June?  Just bury the whole car.  We lost June. 
[54:00]
 George, you're next.  What's up?  What's up, O.N.A.?  How are you?  When the rock comes down, you should interview him in blackface.  Could you imagine that?  He walks in like, hello, Mr. Rock.  What's happening?  Yeah, that'll happen.  That'll happen.  All right, George.  I'll tell you if these guys.  You idiot.  Who else we got on the line?  Let's go to Ryan.  Ryan, you're next on W.N.A.W.  Hey, what's going on, O.N.A.?  All right. 
[54:30]
 Um, you know, Anthony, you check your pants lately?  Why?  Well, since you're so scared, uh, assless of the rock.  Dude, wait, wait.  You can't, you can't curse.  It seems like I crapped myself, you could say.  Oh, sorry.  But no, I'm not.  I want to give an F to you, Weatherman.  Why?  You see all that snow along the island guy yesterday?  Yeah.  Yeah, it must have been a whole eighth of an inch.  Well, I was out on Long Island last night. 
[55:00]
 Oh, and, uh, uh, it seems they got just socked in with, uh, what had to be an eighth, uh,  an eighth of an inch of snow.  Wait, wait.  Right there on the ground.  And I'm a little confused.  You said you were out on Long Island last night?  Yeah.  I thought you, uh, lived out there.  No, no, I don't live out there.  But you and I live a half a mile from each other.  Oh.  I just assumed you were.  No, oh, we used to.  Oh.  We'll have a contest later.  What borough does Anthony live in now?  See if you could guess.  That'd be a good contest. 
[55:30]
 We got something to give away?  Yeah, we could give something away to that.  Yeah, get a prize.  What borough does Anthony live in now?  So it's a borough.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, I'm, I'm moving closer to, uh, the city, though.  Okay.  If not in the city.  Interesting.  Yes.  All right, we'll play that contest in a few minutes.  How's that?  Mm-hmm.  Let's go to, uh, Billy from Heirsic Productions.  Yes, that's right.  I have an apartment right next door to Howard.  Uh, Billy. 
[56:00]
 Oh.  We win, gentlemen.  We win.  The rock is coming crawling back on his knees.  Oh, yeah, we got to see that one.  Please, Ovi and Anthony, please.  I beg your forgiveness.  Oh, don't push out, guys.  I got an idea.  Yeah, don't push out.  You're going to be here?  Yeah, you want me to?  Because look, you know what?  I'll sit there.  I won't say a word like sick boy to you guys.  You all make nice, nice and go, hey, here's the guy who wrote the songs about you.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I'll put on a football helmet and go.  You'll be on the short bus with us, Billy. 
[56:30]
 Hey, like a, oh, it's going to affect my career?  Don't cry for me, Dwayne Johnson.  Yeah, we're a little nervous, Billy.  Oh, come on.  Swear to you.  What do you know?  You want me to come in and hold your hand?  Well, the only reason I'm nervous is because I did read about him where he does have a rage issue.  And if we're not going to back down, if we're really going to try to discuss this with him,  it could get ugly, I'm telling you.  Yeah, it could, but think about it.  Because now we've got some time to prepare and think about it. 
[57:00]
 I mean, we'll be honest.  We looked like pussies last week.  We were blindsided.  We weren't ready.  But don't think about it.  Did you do anything wrong?  No.  Exactly.  That's the whole point.  But you know what?  How funny would it be?  Smooth out everything over and then piss them off again.  Come on.  What is better than that?  The dentist would be going nuts.  Just a matter of time before you see Ant and I on Raw.  Raw is war.  On a big stick.  Rock, you better get your ass out here.  Titan Tron, what would our music be? 
[57:30]
 We walk through the Titan Tron, Opie.  God, I don't know.  We could figure something out.  But what?  Ugh.  Some type of retarded carnival music.  We would look pathetic out there.  Our skinny little white legs.  All right, Billy.  Hey, let me know, guys, if you want to do it.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Yeah, next Thursday, the Rock comes in for round two.  The Rock's a pussy.  The Rock's a pussy.  The half-breed don't like it. 
[58:00]
 He's meant to be tarnated.  The Rock's a pussy.  The Rock's a pussy.  He's meant to be tarnated.  You see on the answer feedback?  Get Jay Moore in the studio for next Thursday's show.  Oh, man.  I don't think we can make that happen.  I think he's too busy out there.  No way.  I think the Rock would kill Jay Moore.  Jay's a big friggin' smart ass is what he is, and he'd say something.  I used to wrestle.  Wait.  Did Rick leave all the numbers behind? 
[58:30]
 Get Jay Moore's number.  Rick's in London.  He's going to be back next week.  Ben, doing a great job this week filling in, by the way.  Yes.  Let's put a golf clap for Ben.  We got to try to get Jay Moore on the line.  He'll give us some advice what to do next Thursday.  Tell that half-breed.  I got to pull a tape of all the things he said about the Rock.  All right.  Let's take a quick break, Ant, and we'll be back.  All right?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Throw men jumping all over each other. 
[59:00]
 Okay.  Terrific.  187-WNEW.  Oh, no.  27-WNEW.  It's The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's FU Friday.  Hey, not many FUs coming in today.  The best way is through the fax line.  Make it short, because we do read a lot of faxes, and if you write a story,  we usually just throw it away.  We don't have time to read too much.  Quick paragraph would do the trick.  Okay?  The fax line, 212-957-9639.  Ant and I are very distracted. 
[59:30]
 We got to give props to Leslie Gold, the radio chick.  What's she up to there?  The radio chick is the show on just before Ant and I.  And wow.  She put some pictures of herself on the WNEW website.  WNEW.com, I believe, or is it FMTalk1027.com?  I think either one will get you there.  All right.  WNEW.com. 
[60:00]
 And she's got two brand new photos of herself, and I'm dying.  Dying over here, Ant.  Yeah, let's take a little look.  I didn't realize she was that hot.  I always thought she was hot, but she's like real hot.  One shot, she's kind of squatting on a stool.  She's got a little bit of legs showing there.  Is that a...  Little legs showing.  Little thigh.  She's dressed in black, blonde hair.  And she's got a bang-me face on.  Without a doubt.  She's making the bang-me face.  We don't get to see her like that. 
[60:30]
 We get to see her with a baseball hat on.  Pulled almost down over her eyes and stuff.  And then what the hell's going on with this second shot?  She's laying on some leopard skin couch thing or something.  And she's got her shirt open.  She's got a bra on, and then her boob is hanging out.  A very sexy bra.  Half her boob is hanging out.  She's got the F-me face going.  That's the look you see right before you jam at home.  She's got a tight little belly thing working here. 
[61:00]
 Look at that. Nice.  Damn, Ant.  Wow.  Didn't know this was going on.  Who took these pictures?  I don't know.  Whichie?  My goodness.  Ant.  Well.  Who knew?  Radio chick, you got us speechless today.  Look at those eyes, man.  Look at those eyes.  She's looking right at me, man.  She wants me. Look at that.  Oh, really?  Taken with the radio chick. 
[61:30]
 Didn't realize she was that hot  because we don't get to see her like that.  You know?  Because it's radio.  Let's face it.  We don't have to dress up for TV cameras or nothing.  We're all a bunch of flops  unless we're doing an appearance or something.  Thank God.  Thank God this isn't TV.  I almost assaulted my dermatologist this morning.  Why?  Oh, dude, come on.  My goddamn 30s.  Look at this.  Look at what the hell's going on with me. 
[62:00]
 Dermatologist throughout the years always saying,  don't worry.  Your pimples will go away as you get older.  I'm going to be like, finally they're gone.  I'm 97 years old.  They're gone because now you got liver spots.  Oh, yeah, right.  Yeah, it's covered up in liver spots.  I got the, you know, when you get a swamp lip  and you're feeling all bad and stuff  and you don't want to go out in public and-  Actually, I got one going on.  Do you?  Yeah.  I got the second nose coming,  going out of the side of my head. 
[62:30]
 Oh, and I go, you know, what does,  what does dermatologist tell you all the time?  Don't squeeze it.  Don't squeeze it.  Don't squeeze it.  I go in there.  What does he do?  He squeezes it.  What makes his squeeze any better?  Like he knows you want to pop that thing.  God damn.  I got, if it makes you feel better,  I got something going on right here.  Yeah.  It's a nerve condition.  Do you feel it?  Oh, yeah.  It's starting to grow as I sit here.  Have anything to do with me?  No, I've been cool as far as what's going on with you lately. 
[63:00]
 I could care less.  As long as you're fun between two and seven.  You're going to pay me back for that cruise?  Yeah.  I will.  I can use the cash too.  I know you can.  Now I know I have to pay you back.  What is it again?  $600?  I don't know.  I didn't check that bill.  I think it's like $600.  And it paid for my girlfriend's cruise to the Caribbean.  How did that happen?  A cruise that I wasn't even on and now I have to pay for it. 
[63:30]
 What do I have to pay?  We're all paying, Opie.  I didn't get nothing from the cruise.  Like I did.  Yeah, actually I did.  I got a week's worth of peace.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, God damn.  Where's a German U-boat when you need it?  Where's that iceberg?  Why couldn't there be an iceberg?  Yeah, it's just like the Titanic when you go on a cruise. 
[64:00]
 Sure.  You'll meet Mr. Right.  All right.  Everyone wants to hear the rock interview over again, Anthony.  The uncomfortable moment.  Yeah.  Who's that?  Is that Jake?  Oh, yeah.  Then why is Spaz typing?  Why is he typing?  Oh, no.  My girlfriend's online.  Oh, no.  Screw it.  Oh, no. 
[64:30]
 Oh, no.  San?  Oh, you decided to listen today?  Oh, good Lord.  Hey, Sandy.  Oh, hi, Anthony.  How you doing?  How are you?  I'm fine.  I'm Dandy.  I can say only that the hair on the back of my neck is standing.  How's your crew?  It was good.  Thank you.  And listen, Greg, I mean, oh my God.  I just called him by his name.  Well, everyone knows my real name.  I know, but it's weird because I never use it.  No one uses it though.  I know.  It's not like I leave the building and then everyone calls me by my real name. 
[65:00]
 No, I know.  I don't even use it.  And my real name is Marcia.  What?  No, I was...  You're saying that you had to pay...  You're paying for the cruise.  I said I'd pay for it.  Did I not make out a check the other day?  Oh, I don't want to cause any rift between you two.  No, you're not causing...  No, no, no, no, no.  Say it.  With what money are you going to pay Ant back with?  My money.  What, you're printing money now?  Yes.  I did.  I was in banking for many years, so I can print money.  Why don't you use that fake money of yours to pay some of those? 
[65:30]
 I'm just kidding with you.  Oh my God.  Come on.  Just because Anthony hates women right now doesn't mean that you...  I don't hate women.  I have to help my buddy through a tough time.  Let me tell you, I love women.  Believe me.  Just... never mind.  Don't get into it.  I love women.  Read paragraph one, that's the problem.  What did you say? 
[66:00]
 Nothing so I have nothing.  Okay.  I just want to let you know that I offered to pay for this.  Yeah, she did, Anthony.  Oh, really?  Yes.  But I do want to thank you for letting me go on it.  Hey, no problem.  And it was cheap, it was only six.  It was six?  Yeah, it was a great deal.  Is that it?  All right.  Next week, live on the show, I'll write out a check to you.  Oh, it's giving me so much pain.  It's nice to know that people are thinking of getting the economical cruises  when I'm getting raked over the coast.  That's good.  It was a good cruise. 
[66:30]
 Definitely was.  All right, Sand, the rock's coming back.  I know, I'm coming in.  Okay.  Uh-oh.  Don't worry about it.  All right, Sandy, you'll save us.  I will.  Do you still like Anthony?  Yes, I do.  All right, Kit.  Okay.  All right, bye, Sandy.  Bye.  Your sister's on the line, Anthony.  Uh-oh.  Everyone check it in.  Hey, Dawn.  Hey.  You're on the air.  Don't say anything stupid.  I'll watch my mouth.  Listen.  Not just the four-letter words.  Don't say anything stupid.  I won't say anything stupid.  I just wanted to tell you not to be saying stupid things on the radio.  I'm not saying anything.  What am I saying? 
[67:00]
 I said nothing.  Okay, when you open the show at three o'clock, even though your show's supposed to start at two.  We were here at two today.  Yeah.  Yeah, you were playing reruns from Wednesday.  We were here at two.  Shut up.  It's May on the E-Ray run.  Come on, the boss is out of town today.  Okay, I won't tell if you won't.  All right.  No one noticed except Anthony's sister.  Yeah, I'm the only one.  You busted us.  Listen, you can't like go on the air and say what you did after the show last night.  I can say whatever the hell I want. 
[67:30]
 No, because I couldn't believe I heard what I heard, and I wound up going in reverse in  the bank drive-through, and I hit someone.  No.  Oh, my sister's getting in an accident.  Any damage?  It was with Johnny's car.  Oh, that's okay.  Yeah, that's okay, then.  Now, just a little scrape on the other car.  Oh, good.  I don't even think we're going to go through insurance companies, but I had to explain to  her my brother is a radio personality, and I was very shocked by what I heard on the  radio, and the car went into reverse. 
[68:00]
 So just be careful.  Oh, don't you worry.  And I saw your old boyfriend last night.  Yeah, I'm going tonight.  Adam Ferraro.  You're going tonight?  We're taking about 25 people with us.  Really?  Yeah, so I better get a cut of this at the door.  Damn, I wish I would have gone tonight.  Yeah, well, you're welcome to meet us.  We're going to dinner beforehand.  Where are you going, the 8 or 10?  The late one.  10 o'clock show?  Yeah.  And a Governor C. Adam.  Yeah.  All right, Donnie.  If you can, meet up with us.  All right, Donnie. 
[68:30]
 Otherwise, I'll see everyone at Super Bowl, right?  Yes.  Oh, are you going to be there with Sandy?  Yeah, I'll be there.  Okay, cool.  Yeah, right.  Okay, guys.  No, of course I'm going to bring my lovely girlfriend.  Very good.  All right.  Very good.  Okay, so Anthony, watch him now.  We don't want anyone else back in the bank drive-up.  Okay, Donnie.  Okay.  All right.  I love you.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye, Donnie.  A lot of surprises on tonight's show.  Tom from Hofstra makes a good point. 
[69:00]
 Hey, Ant, I thought you'd want to know that Opie did a greaseman impression after you left yesterday.  Wait a minute.  I was gone for maybe the last three minutes of the show.  Yeah, tops.  Do you realize how many drinks that is on the Opie and Anthony drinking game?  I forgot about that.  Opie doing an impression.  There's an Opie and Anthony drinking game somewhere on the internet.  I think you could get to it on the unofficial website.  Yeah.  And that's one of the things.  If I ever do an impression on the show, it's like,  I don't know, I think you have to like chug a ton of beer or something.  Yeah.  My God. 
[69:30]
 It was quick and stupid.  And no, I will not repeat it, Anthony.  Thank you very much.  So, okay.  All right.  We're running late, so we got to take another break.  Are we going to get Jay Moore on the line?  The publicist is working on it?  All right.  We're going to try to get Jay Moore on the line because we need some advice  because we found out today, Anthony, live on the radio,  finding out that The Rock is coming back this coming Thursday for another fun-filled interview  by your pals Opie and Anthony.  All right?  It could be fun.  All right. 
[70:00]
 Opie and Anthony.  Someone get this pen out of my nose.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's FU Friday.  I was going through some of the FUs while we were reading the price line,  commercial Anthony.  Yeah.  Not many coming in really.  Nothing good anyway.  The best way to do it is through the fax line,  212-957-9639.  Oh, I need my water spaz badly.  Where is it?  Oh, Paul. 
[70:30]
 All right.  I need my water.  No, I'm dying of thirst here.  Go back to the phones.  Hey, Chris, what's up today?  Yes, fellas.  I'm kind of a little disappointed today.  I made this beautiful sign to bring to the garden on Sunday.  I'm going.  I don't know whether I should bring it now.  I don't want to cause any trouble between you and him, you know?  No, go ahead.  Bring all the signs.  Really?  It's still on, yeah.  It's beautiful.  It says, hey, Rock, eat your heart out and steal the show. 
[71:00]
 Love, Opie and Anthony.  All right.  I got a picture of you guys from the magazine on there.  Honestly, you know, we're still very, very pissed off at the Rock  and very pissed off at the WWF.  We'll see what happens Thursday.  Let me tell you something about this whole thing.  The Rock is coming in next Thursday.  I got the call from the WWF today.  They didn't explain anything.  They didn't apologize, nothing.  They didn't tell us why the Rock acted like he did, blah, blah, blah.  But this is not fake.  I'm surprised.  Is it even a great to let him come on if he's going to resolve on the phone? 
[71:30]
 This isn't fake, though.  I will not accept that today from our listeners.  If someone that doesn't like the show wants to pound us with  an innocent feedback or a phone call saying this is definitely fake,  it's a setup, you know, you guys did this all along, whatever.  But the faithful listeners got to understand this is not fake.  I know it's real.  Absolutely not.  We were really pissed off when Rock came in here and left.  He looked like a crybaby.  You know, he blindsided us.  We had nothing to do with what he was claiming. 
[72:00]
 Um, man to man, I told him, look, I have no idea what you're talking about.  He still was, you know, like a little crybaby and walked out on us.  Yeah, question.  I know.  It's like I was uncomfortable driving in the car with him.  I can imagine how you guys felt.  Finch the face with him.  And he's coming back this Thursday and it's going to be interesting radio  because I if I back down a second time, I'll never forgive myself.  I'm serious.  That's going to be rough.  It's going to be a weird day.  But don't don't don't even begin to think that this is all a setup 
[72:30]
 because it's not.  Oh, I don't think it's a setup at all.  Well, a bunch of people are pounding us and I swear to God, you know,  like you said, the faithfulness was like me.  No, it was the real deal.  So it's hard to believe anything as far as wrestling is concerned.  You know, when when what's his name died?  Um, Owen Hart, Owen Hart died like I didn't think he was really dead.  Right.  So obviously people are going to think it's some kind of a wrestling angle  to have the rock pissed at us.  If it's an angle, we don't know anything about it. 
[73:00]
 And that's the guy's honest truth.  No clue.  But I don't think it is because he was really, you know, bummed out.  And the words eat and steal on my sign are in bold print.  All right, Chris.  Good.  Very good.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Good.  All right.  Bye.  Another Chris on the line.  What's up, Chris?  Oh, hey, what's up?  Hey.  All right.  I just want to give a few out to the guy was just about front row center with a man cow  wild sign on a smack down line.  That was pretty frustrating. 
[73:30]
 Can I I mean, there's a list of stations that have stolen the wow concept from us  and they're all listed on the foundrymusic.com underground website.  Please pound those radio stations because now everyone has forgotten where that whole  concept started.  Yeah, because now whatever it's all over the place now.  Right.  And we're not getting credit for it because we're only in one market right now.  So there was a bunch of rubes in all these tiny little radio markets all over the country 
[74:00]
 that think, you know, man cow is God because they think he came up with this  with them on Wednesday concept.  They didn't.  Right.  Last night, I think the show was in Chicago.  Right.  I don't know if he's on there or what.  All right.  But I was also wondering if I could be the first contestant in What Burrow Does Anthony  Live In?  Oh, yeah, sure.  Are we doing that?  Yeah.  What's the contest again?  What borough does Anthony live in?  It's kind of easy because there's only so many boroughs.  Right.  Right.  Well, I'm going to take the obvious and say Manhattan.  You were saying Manhattan? 
[74:30]
 Yeah.  No, it is not Manhattan.  I work at WNEW.  All right.  Remember that.  I cannot afford an apartment in Manhattan.  Please.  All right, Chris.  Thank you.  All right.  I'm very excited.  Get to find out where you're living now.  Yeah.  Hope he doesn't even know.  No one knows.  Want to take another guess at?  All right.  Tim?  Hey, how you doing, Open Hat?  Real good.  All right.  I think it's not where does Anthony live.  Where did he drunk German head with the bullet all in his head? 
[75:00]
 Live not an ant on the couch.  No, sorry.  Okay, man.  All right.  All right.  All right.  What is this big, huge, Opie Anthony thing?  You're going to wave it someday.  Oh, nice.  Really?  I'm Anthony1027.  Where's he waving that?  At the arena.  Oh, cool.  I think it's from the floor.  Awesome.  Good.  Hope the Rock sees it and turns it sideways and shoves it up your candy ass.  Hey, John, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Great.  I heard you were thirsty, Hope. 
[75:30]
 Yeah, we're all thirsty.  A little while ago.  Well, I was wondering, since I'm just a little bit away here,  and since we have a cause to celebrate since you're thirsty  and to make up for the crappy phone call I gave you yesterday,  how about I come by with a couple of sixes?  And a bossy in around either, right?  I'm happy to do it.  Well, you know, we could have the beers and then after the show,  well, they've been chilling in the fridge,  we can enjoy some in the safety and sanctity of our office,  far from the on air studio.  Of course.  Come by, John.  Thank you.  I'll be back. 
[76:00]
 Bye.  No one else wants to guess what borough you live in?  What?  There's only a few left.  Yeah.  Al, what's up?  Hey, guys, you know how frustrating it is to listen to you guys?  Not scheme, what was the word?  You guys are playing games again.  You're not being honest.  Well, what do you mean?  You're talking amongst yourselves with your girlfriend, your siblings,  and don't say this and don't say that.  I haven't a clue what the hell you're talking about.  Wait, then you got to be friggin' retarded, Al. 
[76:30]
 For what I gather, I think that Anthony's wife or something threw him out or whatever.  See, I don't know.  No, no, no.  You go again.  No, obviously not a faithful listener.  We've been giving you guys hints for months.  I've been listening.  I listen while I'm working, you know.  If you put the pieces together, you know every detail.  Why is something growing on your face?  Because Anthony, we don't know that either.  No, that's just...  No, no, he gets a cold sore on his lip when he's stressed out. 
[77:00]
 That's his cross to bear.  Isn't he stressed out because of you?  No, no.  I'll tell you why I'm stressed out.  You really want to know?  Yeah, I'd like to know.  All right, because tomorrow I'm getting that laser surgery on my eyes.  Are you really?  Yeah, and I'm freaking out.  That's not foolproof, brother.  What?  That's not foolproof.  I looked into it.  No, no kidding.  That's why I'm scared.  I might back out at the last minute and I don't even want to take any calls from anyone  about this because I didn't even want to bring it up because I'm freaked enough. 
[77:30]
 Good luck to you.  All right.  See you later.  Bye.  Man, Mary wants to guess where you're now living, Anthony.  All right, Mary?  Mary?  What's up, guys?  All right.  How are you all doing today?  Would you like to play Where is Anthony Living Now?  Yeah, actually I would.  Where?  Well, since you work for WNEW and they crap money,  I say you're living up in Harlem.  Yeah, me and Vanjie.  You and the brothers again and on.  Me and Vanjie jacking up. 
[78:00]
 Vanjie, that's her name, Vanjie.  I can't remember her name.  No, I am not living in Harlem.  Oh, man, I thought you were going to find the FDR from now on.  Very good, Mary.  Thank you.  Later, guys.  Bye.  Wow, no one has guessed it yet, Ant.  Nope.  John, you're next on the program.  What's up?  Oh, Peter and Anthony.  Yes.  How are you doing?  All right.  I was in the ESPN zone bar the other night and I met The Rock.  And my friend Sam, he knows a lot of wrestlers and he introduced me to him and he was talking to 
[78:30]
 him and I asked him a question after we were talking for a little bit.  I said, I listened to Opiate Addity a little bit.  I heard the show and he was talking some mad crap about you guys.  Oh, yeah?  He hates you guys.  He hates us.  Hates?  Why does he hate us?  He didn't flat out say I hate him.  He's like, give me the cold, Jolie.  He's like, those guys are chumps.  I'm like, yeah, I don't listen to them.  Even though I listen to you all the time, I'm like, yeah, I don't listen to them that much.  Yeah, you pussy.  Oh, you curse.  You're cursed, man.  Thank you, John.  Sorry, dude. 
[79:00]
 See?  Everyone's all brave until you see them face to face.  I know.  And you definitely act differently.  Sal, you're next on WNDW.  What's up, guys?  How are you doing?  Good.  I say when The Rock comes in, you guys get dressed like goalies, hockey goalies.  Full equipment, the whole nine yards.  Nah, it won't work.  Not a bad idea.  I'm seriously thinking about it.  And you guys, Anthony?  Yeah?  How about the bar of Queens?  Oh, you're saying Queens?  Yes, I am. 
[79:30]
 No.  All right, guys.  You guys suck.  As far as Anthony's concerned, no, not Queens.  That's too close.  No, not Queen.  You started your life in Queens, though.  Yeah, it's flushing.  All right, I'm trying to find the answer for you here, buddy.  Matt, what's up?  Yo, what's going on, guys?  All right.  I say it's the Bronx.  No, it is not the Bronx.  What do you got up to, guys?  Yeah, we're running out of burrows. 
[80:00]
 Certainly are, very quickly running out of burrows.  All right, let's go to John.  John, you're up next.  What's up?  I say Brooklyn.  Brooklyn!  Yes.  All right.  I'm Italian.  I'm named Anthony.  It was the law.  I had to.  Anthony, you're living in Brooklyn?  Yes.  Hey, guys.  Hey, let me write that down.  Brooklynite.  Could we guess your phone number now?  Because I would like to have that.  Go ahead and sell. 
[80:30]
 It's the first, like, number nine.  It's 718.  I'll tell you that much.  7184.  I'm not telling you.  No, I'll fucking get my goddamn phone number.  All right, John, I think you got a lovely gift prize  from the Opie and Anthony show.  Cool.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Ben, what do we got for him?  What, John?  Last night, I was watching the Channel 2 news  that we're interviewing guys that were going  through the homeless shelter.  Yeah.  Ziggy was on.  Someone else faxed us about that.  Yeah.  Get out!  I faxed that to you guys earlier, yeah.  Is that really true?  Yeah, Ziggy was on there. 
[81:00]
 They had it right underneath there.  Ziggy, homeless person.  No.  I was like, holy crap, Ziggy, I got to call these guys.  No kidding.  Yeah, I was like, whoa.  All right, John.  I recognized them from the unofficial website.  Right, which is over a million hits today.  Cool.  Well, Ben, what do we got for John?  DVDs, CDs, shirts, videos, all kinds of stuff.  Wow.  Big prize package.  Look at that, a prize package.  Cool.  For guessing where Aunt lives now.  Where I live.  All right, John, hold on to line, all right?  All right.  All right, cool.  Look at this, Opie.  Tommy from New York saying, you better hope your eye surgery  goes terrible so you won't be able to see 
[81:30]
 the rock kicking your ass next week.  I think I'm going to back out.  No, come on.  I'm serious.  You can't back out.  It's supposed to be.  Everybody's on instant feedback, at least, saying that it's good.  2020 vision.  I know.  It'd be nice.  God, too bad I didn't have this surgery when I was really single.  No, because then I would have been picking up some hot babes and stuff 
[82:00]
 because I'd be able to see them.  Wait, what are you saying?  They looked hot in the dark bars without glasses.  Without glasses on?  Oh, my gosh.  Different story when I brought them home.  It might have been the beer talking then again.  Hey, you got a schlomp.  Let's take a break.  We'll regroup and we'll be back. 
[82:30]
 1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  It's FU Friday with Opie and Anthony.  We're just kind of screwing off today.  It's Friday.  Pretty much like every day.  Are we getting any faxes, Ben?  Not really, huh?  I want to send a big FU to...  Can't read it.  What the who the what?  A big FU to Hillary Clinton. 
[83:00]
 She couldn't get a job as a daytime stripper with that fat ass.  Please hypnotize the rock and turn him into a...  Into a...  Oh, I can't say that.  Let's see.  Wow, stop.  Big FU to Anthony for sounding like Stern whining about his wife.  Oh, shut up.  Like I'm friggin whining.  Give me a break.  You won't hear Anthony whine.  I'm banging. 
[83:30]
 Okay.  And once again, a bunch of faxes and none we can really read on the air  because they're they're pointless really.  So keep trying.  Fax line two one two nine five seven nine six three nine.  Let's go to Joe.  Joe, what's going on?  Hey, Opie.  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  You said you were scared.  Let me tell you something about the laser surgery.  I didn't even want to bring this up on the air.  I think most clothes you're going to get, it's going to be positive.  This being one of them.  I had it done last September and it's unbelievable. 
[84:00]
 I'm sitting on my computer.  Prior to getting surgery, I couldn't read the computer screen.  The big E on the chart.  Forget about it.  You know, it was just a big blur.  Next day, the day after the surgery, I'm reading my neighbor's license plate  from across the street.  I couldn't tell what kind of car it was before.  I love you guys that get the surgery.  You talk about like how you're just walking around reading things now and it's like amazing.  Let me tell you something.  To this day, a year later, every once in a while I'm driving around and I'll look and go, 
[84:30]
 man, this is incredible.  Yeah, see, and you don't understand because you never really,  you never had classes around, right?  You don't understand.  What do you wear?  Oh, be contacts glasses.  Um, classes right now.  All right.  Yeah, I used to wear contacts, but it was just, it was a nightmare.  It sounds crazy.  And I guess unless you wear contacts, if the five minutes it takes to wash them,  you know, in the morning, what a pain in the ass.  Yeah.  What a pain in the ass.  It would be nice to just walk outside and be able to see stuff without putting my classes on.  And all that stuff.  You struck a nerve with me when you said how afraid you were. 
[85:00]
 Yeah, I'm freaking.  I'm not going to lie.  I skydive.  I remember my first jump was I had a malfunction where my name didn't open.  I had to go to reserve.  Let me tell you something.  I was more scared going in for this, for the surgery.  I didn't jump out of a plane.  I didn't jump out of the plane.  I'm telling you.  But yeah, I wake up every day.  I'm going to do it.  And then like by the end of the day, I'm like, no, I can't do that.  Yeah, it helped me.  I went, when I went there, I watched someone going through it.  Now it's a little, it's a little gruesome to watch it. 
[85:30]
 I don't know what you're having it done.  Maybe you don't want to say, but, uh, I'm sure you did your research  on your doc.  Yes, big time.  If you guys, you know, the one thing I learned, if you, if you are going  to get this laser surgery done, you got to do the research on the doctor  because this, this procedure is getting so huge that, um, a lot of these  doctors are getting a weekend course and then they're, they're doing it.  Yeah.  Pretty soon dentists will be able to do what the drill to hang a shingle out.  Right?  Yeah.  Because I mean, they're getting certified to do the surgery pretty  much every weekend, a bunch of people. 
[86:00]
 So you got to find some of that is done on an S load of these.  Absolutely.  And that's key.  You know, and, uh, the guy, I, the guy, I spoke to so many people, you know,  who I, I, friends of friends.  Yeah.  Don't give me his number.  Let me call him and, uh, got a lot of positive, positive feedback on it.  So that, that kind of helped, but, uh, it do it.  Uh, the only thing I, I was, I was talking to spaz before he was asking me,  it's not painful, but it's a lot more uncomfortable than they lead you to  believe it was.  Oh, at least the guy's being honest. 
[86:30]
 I'm going to tell you straight out.  All right.  They put this thing in your clockwork orange.  You guys saw the movie, I'm sure.  Yes.  The thing that holds the eye open is called the scapula.  If I remember correctly, that they will man, that thing hurts when they,  when they put it on and it, your eyes wide open.  Then they put you have an elastic done, right?  Yeah.  And they put this device, Anthony, you, it's like, uh,  Listen to Anthony free cause he's more like screamish than, than I.  It's a mechanical plane and what it does, it slides across the top of your eye 
[87:00]
 and it slices the corny.  If I remember correctly, just like 95% of the way through.  Then he takes a pair of tweezers.  And he flips the flips that lip, that flap that he just created by the slice over.  Yeah.  And once he does that, he is where I got scared going through it.  You go blind.  You don't see any light.  Everything goes black.  Your eye is open and you're blind. 
[87:30]
 Right.  Because what he did is he just took off the part of the eye that you're looking through.  Yeah. Like that, like every part of your eye is, uh, is necessary.  It's not like extra parts.  So they remove the top of your cornea.  You don't want to just slice this off and lose it.  Right.  Now, so how long are you blind for?  Um, as long as it takes the laser to do its thing and what you, what you did.  And I'm, I told him, man, I must have left my fingerprints in the, uh,  the chair rails because I'm squeezing for all I'm worth.  I'm not going tomorrow. 
[88:00]
 I'm not going.  I'm not going to sit here and act brave.  I'm a puss.  Oh, you're taking this wrong.  I'm trying to poke you into doing this.  How long, how long did it take?  Uh, how long did you have your flap flap open?  Oh, I'd say, I'd say about 15 seconds.  Cause what you do with when he flaps it open, everything goes black,  but you could still see there's a red dot on the laser.  And he says, just stare at the red dot.  And I'm like, doc, I can't see the dot.  He goes, you're doing, you know, at that point when I couldn't see it. 
[88:30]
 I'm just concentrating on holding my eyeballs still.  All right.  I'm looking at the same spot.  I'm looking at the same spot and you hear the laser and it's like, uh,  it sounds like a tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.  And what it does, it just, it, it burns off and burns probably the wrong term.  It's like, uh, it's like a cold laser, I believe.  And it just shaves down the, um, the cornea to the proper curvature.  And then that stops.  He flips the thing over and you could start seeing again.  Everything's blurry as hell.  This is one eye. 
[89:00]
 I'm talking about one eye at a time.  Obviously, uh, he flips it over.  You start seeing light again.  You make out images, uh, from going completely blind and black,  you can actually see, uh, you know, shapes and colors.  Let me tell you, well, once they did that, they're done with the eye.  You relax and they do the same thing to the other eye.  This is why I think about that.  That takes about 10, 10, maybe 15 minutes between the time they stop 
[89:30]
 your rest period between the left eye and the right eye.  I get up out of the chair and walk outside.  And before I went in for the surgery, I looked out the window and I, you know,  tried to read something across the way.  It was a big Nordstrom sign.  And, uh, let me tell you something.  That big sign on the side of the building was hard to see when I went in.  When I came out, it was blurry as hell.  But guess what?  I can actually see it.  Oh man.  So, uh, it's unbelievable. 
[90:00]
 All right.  And I got to look at it.  How long ago did you have it done?  There's September.  Okay.  If, uh, if I can, if you'll give me a chance, I'll go on real quick.  Go ahead.  Looking at this later on that day, my vision's not getting any better.  Here's where I started worrying again.  Holy s***.  Holy s***.  What I do to my eyes, everything's blurry.  There's a double vision and I'm getting real nervous.  I went to bed that night.  The next morning I woke up, I had 2015 vision. 
[90:30]
 And it's overnight.  You go from seeing blurry to seeing better than you ever did in your life.  All right, Joe.  Hey, all the bad stuff, it's worth it.  You know, I, well, you just said, uh, I'm not doing it.  Do it.  I'm telling you, it's amazing.  And, uh, it's worth the money you pay for it.  Wow.  That's one man's opinion.  Of course, maybe someone could give you a call a little later telling you that,  you know, they see double vision, but, uh.  How do they, how do they fasten that flap back? 
[91:00]
 The eye has, again, uh, it's what I was told, I get to put layman's turnstile on  Stan, but it's the eye has like a natural sucking action.  And when they flip.  Ah, come on.  You're using all the wrong words, man.  It's like a pulsing action.  When, when they flip the cornea back down, it kind of sucks itself back on.  And then eventually that, that incision that they made with the, with the, uh,  that plane heals itself.  Would you just be afraid to blink that it's going to flap off? 
[91:30]
 Well, you know, it took us, he says, you know, don't, don't shout, don't stare up  at the shower and you know, I'm, I'm protecting my eyes.  They give you, they give you the, uh, goggles to put on too.  Actually, you know what, you know what?  Holy Jesus, you got to come in here wearing goggles.  I'll wet myself.  The old man in Florida type glass.  The Terminator glasses.  Terminator glasses.  You got it.  You got to wear this.  My name is Opie.  Hi.  You haven't done tomorrow.  I don't know. 
[92:00]
 All right, Joe.  Thank you.  Hey, well, I hope I, I hope I was able to give you a little insight and give you some  positive feedback.  It's, uh, that's all, you know, that's the gruesome details.  But do it.  It changes your life.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Take care.  Oh, there goes Joe.  This won't hurt a bit.  Johnny, you're next on the show.  What's up?  Hey, what's up guys?  How you doing?  Hey, I got a couple things for both of you guys. 
[92:30]
 One, oh, um, with regards to, um, that laser surgery.  Yes.  Um, a buddy of mine had a fish hook in his eye.  We were out fishing.  Oh, and that's disgusting, man.  That's all I can think about.  And also if you got to wear short and curl, I mean, you got to wear those.  What happens if you get a short curly in there, man?  You get a short curly in your eye.  Yeah.  I mean, if you're down there, you don't know.  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  Maybe he won't have to, maybe he won't put his head down there. 
[93:00]
 Yeah.  And that, um, you said you're living in Brooklyn, right?  Yeah.  Are you living in your car?  Yeah, that's it.  I'm on the side of the belt parkway.  I thought you'd bunk it up with all dirty or something.  Yeah, that's what it is.  Hey, do you need a furniture?  We can get a little furniture drive going for you.  No, I think I could, uh, I think I could swing a couple of beanbag chairs and a cooler.  That's all I need.  Four recliners and a TV.  Oh, TV.  Whoa. 
[93:30]
 Boy, that'd be nice.  Now, I'll be just fine, man.  Hey, yo, with Valentine's Day coming up, what's happening?  You going to get chained to another car and keep her up for one more year?  Uh, definitely.  After what I learned today, what are you kidding?  What I learned today?  Pre-nup.  All right, guys.  That word has just entered my vocabulary. 
[94:00]
 Yeah.  Hey, is there anything as a post-nup?  Pre-nup.  Brian?  Yes?  What's up?  Don't do it.  Oh, I knew it.  I knew it.  I knew it.  I knew it.  I got a story for you.  You know what's scary?  The guy before you that just completely freaked me out was all for me getting the surgery tomorrow.  He said no matter what the horror is, it's worth it.  That he had to explain to me, and now we have a guy saying don't do it. 
[94:30]
 Go ahead, Brian.  He, my uncle, he had, you know, pretty bad sight.  Now, this is secondhand info.  The first guy was firsthand info.  Okay.  But he's a very close uncle to me.  He's a good friend of mine.  He goes in for the surgery.  He goes, Brian, for a second, in one eye, never got the vision back.  Oh, shut up.  I'm serious.  I gotta hang up on him.  His little piece of cornea like slipped off.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Fell on the floor.  That's the dream I've had. 
[95:00]
 Because the machine goes across and actually slices the cornea, and it makes a flap.  And then the flap is like, you know, folded over, and then the laser.  And then they put the flap back.  Put the flap back.  And the nightmare I've been having lately is they just keep going and cut it right off.  I'm sure it's not how far the machine goes that does the cut.  I'm sure it goes all the way past your eye, but like the top or bottom is still connected. 
[95:30]
 Well, yeah.  You know what I mean?  It's not like, oh, the machine went too far and cut the whole slice off.  So you think-  Like a piece of ham at the belly.  Well, this is the stuff I'm going to learn tomorrow.  So you don't think there's a possibility whatsoever of it going too far and just completely slicing it off?  Oh, dude, there's a possibility the whole apparatus could cave in and fall into your head.  What do I know?  Hey, Chris, what's going on?  How you doing, guys?  All right.  I had the surgery done about three and a half years ago.  Yeah.  When it was in sort of its infancy. 
[96:00]
 And they went over with the laser.  They cut it everything.  They put a-  At the Joseph Mengele Eye Center, he had it done.  They put a protective contact over it.  So I went to sleep that night.  The next morning I go to wake up.  I tried to open my eyes.  I started screaming in pain.  The contact fell out with all the medication covering the eye.  And I had to be dragged to the doctor with my eyes closed,  walking with two people holding me because I couldn't get outside  because there was no cornea over it. 
[96:30]
 It was just raw skin up against my eyes.  Well, that's three years ago.  I know.  It has changed, but I do have perfect vision.  Where are you going to get it done?  I don't want to say right now.  I can understand.  And you living in Bensonhurst?  Close enough.  Really?  Bay Ridge?  Very close.  Drink if you're in Brooklyn.  Cool, man.  I'll talk to you later.  Later.  Bye-bye.  Can't say exactly where Anthony's staying.  I'm such a huge celebrity.  Oh, sure.  I'd be slumped.  Hey.  Oh, you are Anthony. 
[97:00]
 Hey, Sal, what's up?  What's up?  I got my eye surgery done a couple months ago.  I don't know where the guy went.  He must have went to Joe the Butcher or something.  Yeah.  Well-  Nothing.  I mean, don't be afraid.  You don't go blind when they flip the thing open.  You just see blurry.  The guy, I don't know where he went.  The only time you go blind is when they put the thing to open  to cut that thing around it.  That's it.  Right.  And they numb your eye so much with those drops,  you could punch yourself in the face.  You won't feel a thing.  Maybe you should do that when the rock comes in.  You won't feel it. 
[97:30]
 That's not a bad idea.  But it's-  So you're very happy with the results?  Very happy.  I got 15, 15 vision.  I brought my partner with me,  my girlfriend with me.  Seven people have brought with me.  How bad were your eyes before?  I was on the contact.  It was minus 275 and minus 250.  Wow.  That's pretty bad.  My girlfriend was minus 10 and she's 20, 20.  Yeah.  I mean, it was really bad.  All right.  But I mean, I went to Dr. Nick Sarley.  I don't know if I can say his name,  but he's really great.  No pain whatsoever.  These guys are all trying to scare you. 
[98:00]
 I'm the biggest pussy there is when it comes to docs.  Right.  Let me tell you, but I wasn't afraid at all.  Thank you.  And I got to see it before I did it because I did-  I watched my brownlose being done.  I will not be able to watch anyone else.  If I'm going to do it, I just got to just do it.  I'm not going to sit there and watch someone else go through it.  No way.  Give me a little bit because you got the big TV,  all you see is the pupil being done.  And that like freaked me out a little bit.  But you don't get to see it when you're underneath the laser.  All right.  And I got a big F view to Mother Nature  because it's damn freezing out here.  All right, Sal. 
[98:30]
 Very cold out here.  Have a good weekend.  Hey, if you come to Diker Heights, Anthony,  come over to the house.  I'll give you a nice homemade wine.  All right, man.  Take care.  Everyone welcoming me, Steve.  Welcome back to the neighborhood, Anthony.  Says, yo, welcome to Brooklyn.  The fine people of Brooklyn welcoming me,  I'll be with open arms.  Well, you'll fit right in.  Of course.  If I moved to Brooklyn, I don't think I would fit in as well as you.  I've always loved Brooklyn.  To be with my own kind, I think I have to go all the way out to Riverhead.  Isn't that where the Polish community is? 
[99:00]
 I don't know.  A lot of blacks in Riverhead.  I'm not that Polish.  I'm a mutt.  Uh, all right, a couple more in the eye surgery and we'll move on.  Mike, what's up?  What's happening, guys?  All right.  I had it done last Friday.  Last week?  Last week.  OK.  10 a.m. in the morning.  Got home at 1, laid down till 4.  Got up and the first thing I saw was the time on my VCR, crystal clear.  Wow, look at this, a success story.  Unbelievable.  And it was no big deal?  No big deal.  You go dark for about 10 to 15 seconds. 
[99:30]
 And then you see the light, like you said, that pulse come back on.  The whole thing takes five minutes.  It doesn't take 20 minutes or a half hour.  These doctors are doing this in their sleep now too.  Yeah.  Well, this guy's in midtown.  You probably heard of him.  I won't say who it is, but you knew what he was doing.  Cool.  So good luck, Opie.  Go do it.  All right.  Opie, it was.  All right.  Thank you.  See you.  Bye.  Don't get...  See, then I'm like, OK, no big deal.  I'll go tomorrow.  Sounds good.  And now I go to Tony.  Tony, what's up?  Opie, don't do it.  Opie, I'm telling you the truth, man. 
[100:00]
 Listen, I had the surgery done about three months ago.  Yeah.  All right?  Here's my problem, OK?  My left eye, they screwed up something with my tear duct.  And what happens is, if you see my eye right now,  I got so much water oozing out of my eye, it's constantly...  I have to use either like a cloth or something with me  because they tell me it's normal.  But I got to tell you the truth.  It is absolutely the grossest thing because it oozes.  Your eye, you can't help it.  It's like you're crying all the time in one eye. 
[100:30]
 It's horrible.  I've got a lawsuit pending because the one eye that I did have it done to is fine.  And then you go back to the second eye.  But now all of a sudden, I explained to them what's going on.  The doctor said, well, at first he said, don't worry about it.  It's normal.  And now all of a sudden, don't worry.  It's going to heal all by itself.  Well, that's one of the things I've heard, too.  All right, Tony, thank you.  Tony? 
[101:00]
 Thank you.  All right, man.  Infected his hearing, too, Opie.  Obviously.  Bob, what's up?  We've got to wrap up this thing.  Hey, Opie, I was thinking of having this surgery done myself.  But that first guy that was talking to you, I think caught me out of it.  I think he talked half of the tri-state area out of it.  And he was the one that was positive.  I know.  And the thing is, my wife said to me the other day,  I think you should go for a vasectomy.  And I say, should I get my eyes fixed or go for a vasectomy?  But after what that guy said, I think I'm going to go for the vasectomy.  I'm not really sure. 
[101:30]
 I hope I go to the right doctor when I get it done, though.  No doubt.  Yeah.  And Anthony, you're full of...  Well, you're not living in Brooklyn.  You're in old Westbrook with Allison.  All right, Bob.  Okay.  Bye.  Bye.  Yeah, we never went by the house to give her flowers.  No.  We should have done that.  One of the bits that we never did.  Seamus, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  All right.  Listen, I work in one of the centers.  It's no problem.  It takes five minutes.  You'll never even know it was done. 
[102:00]
 Really?  Yeah.  You just got to put in drops.  Putting in the drops are worse than the procedure.  Yeah.  Sure.  Trust me.  I've actually seen the flap get cut off.  All right.  Cut it out.  That's what I'm worried about.  No, it gets cut off.  They put it right back on and believe it or not, in less than four minutes, it's healed back down.  You would never knock it off.  How the hell does that happen?  How does your eyes like...  Yeah, how does that...  Three layers and they don't go down to the bottom layer.  The middle layer is really cohesive. 
[102:30]
 Cohesive, Opie?  It's like glue.  It's its own goo-glue.  Goo-glue-glue.  It's called Seroma.  It heals right down.  All right.  Really?  How many do you guys do a day?  Probably around 10 a day.  Really?  Just go to someone who's going to treat you right.  Don't go to someone that says, oh, I do 50 a day.  If he does 50 a day, how does he have any time for you?  Take your time.  You know what we could have done?  Honestly...  Go to someone that's good.  Honestly, the guy I picked, I have no problem with. 
[103:00]
 I'm just scared in general.  I've been doing research on this for a really long time since last April.  We should have gone to one of those butcher shops and got one of those cow eyes  and a razor.  And I could have showed you.  Shut it out, Ant!  Hey, that razor they use is like a $20,000 razor.  Really?  Yeah.  Very sharp, very thin.  Oh, man, you wouldn't believe this thing.  It's so precise.  All right. 
[103:30]
 Thank you, Seamus.  Hey, good luck with it, man.  All right, man.  Last one.  We'll end this with Matt.  Matt, you're next.  What's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  All right.  I just had the surgery done like two days ago.  It's like amazing.  It's like I could see perfect now.  Really?  Like I was totally blind almost before.  Yeah, man, you definitely got to go get it done.  Don't listen to those guys.  See, I'm not that blind, though.  I can walk around without glasses for the most part.  Yeah, but those guys, man...  It's like night driving and all that crap.  I want to like, you know...  You don't want to crash.  No, I don't. 
[104:00]
 All right, guys.  All right, Matt.  And go do it, though.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  All right, we got to take a break.  I don't know what to do.  I don't know what to do now.  I guess you got to do it.  I mean, come on.  It's over in five minutes.  No matter how bad the horror is, it'll be over in five minutes.  The odds are good that it'll be fine.  No longer than a slow death by slitting someone's throat. 
[104:30]
 You'd sit there and bleed out and it would take five minutes.  No different than maybe you sitting on the train tracks in a car  with the train barreling down on you.  It's five minutes.  That's it, right?  I guess so.  So the horror that you might feel is only going to be five minutes long.  Right.  Who's on the warm line before we take a break?  We are trying to get Jay Moore.  Come on, Spaz.  Who is it?  All right, we got to take a break.  Nope, they hung up.  All right, we'll be back.  Stay there. 
[105:00]
 Put your glasses on after you had it done.  It looks like you're looking through binoculars backwards.  People look really far away.  Or maybe it'll look like a telescope. 
[105:30]
 Cut it out, man.  Now everyone's calling me a pussy.  All right, I'll just do it.  I'll just do it.  Do it.  You can do it.  You can do it.  Bill, you're next on the radio show.  What's up?  How's it going?  My name is Bill.  Yes, I know.  Oh, sorry.  I got some this week.  Watch out.  Go ahead, Bill.  Yeah, it's not an FU though.  All right, go ahead.  I see Anthony's taking his situation very well.  And I want to come in there for inspiration  and to see some naked chicks.  Kind of cheer me up. 
[106:00]
 Who says I got dumped?  I didn't say, no, I'm not saying you did.  I said your situation.  I know you're not dumped.  You're happy.  I want to address the situation.  Is that the official name for this?  Yeah, let's call it the situation.  It's called the situation.  We like to call it the situation.  Well, I don't want to make a direct reference.  Yeah, code word snatch.  We'll just call it the situation.  All right, Bill. 
[106:30]
 Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Dave, you're next on the radio show.  Yeah, I got a big FU for Anthony.  Why?  He's such a puss.  Backing down when he hears the rocks coming in.  And then all of a sudden I'm listening to the Howard Stern  show where I'm listening to him crying about his marital problems.  He's just a big puss. 
[107:00]
 I hope the rock comes in there.  I hope the rock tears you a new a-hole.  Thank you, Dave.  You got it.  Rock will be here Thursday.  I love it.  All right, Dave.  Thank you.  Bye.  Are you distraught today, Anthony?  I'm so distraught.  I'm going through the instant feedbacks and about 20 girls want to bang me.  Wow, this chick wants to F you on line 10.  Sarah.  Yeah.  What's up?  Nothing. 
[107:30]
 You want to F Anthony?  Yep, I want to be the first one to vote on that.  After the situation's over?  The situation.  Oh my God.  Well, we'll wait till after the situation.  Hank, we have a contest, you think?  Why?  Why?  Give one of our fine listeners a chance to, you know,  to bang me.  Oops, too late.  We already have a winner. 
[108:00]
 What?  What?  Well, Sarah, I don't think he's going to take you up on that one.  All right, sorry.  That's okay.  Hey, Anthony, you want to be just like Howard, don't you?  This is from Gary, New York.  Old bit.  This is an old bit.  This is an old bit.  I'm ripping off Howard.  I'm a stern wannabe.  That's exactly it.  That's the reason that there's a situation.  Well, Howard didn't invent that, didn't he, Anthony?  Do you know how pissed I was when he announced that? 
[108:30]
 Like, oh, I'm being separated from my wife, Jackie.  Woohoo.  He announces it.  Meanwhile, I'm already probably a month out of my house already,  but haven't said anything on the air, you know,  because I'm just, you know, wait for the right time.  He announced it.  I'm like, great.  Now everyone's going to say I'm ripping off Howard.  That's a little going to extreme, isn't it?  Maybe I can understand doing a wacky voice  that I might have heard on the Stern show in the 80s.  Billy West genius. 
[109:00]
 But I mean, no, I think that would be taking a little far.  If you're saying I'm breaking up with my wife because of Howard.  You should have said something earlier, though,  then we could have claimed that he was ripping you off.  Maybe we could go through some tapes  before Howard announced it.  See if there was any signs.  Oh, there were signs.  See if there was any.  Yeah, there was me and everyone speaking to each other.  There was.  We were excited.  We were talking to each other.  I know guys don't even know what happened.  Oh, it's hysterical.  It's just a laugh riot.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, now I do deal with like lawyers and stuff. 
[109:30]
 You know how much fun we have with lawyers?  Like, oh, feeling what your own is bad enough.  I think I'm involved with your situation.  But hers is the feeling I'm getting  with some of the stuff you told me in the office today.  Oh.  How did I get involved?  I don't know.  I don't know.  How am I involved with your situation?  Oh, and then she goes out and gets that fat bastard lawyer.  Ah, ah. 
[110:00]
 That's all I'll say.  Ah, I'll represent you.  Ah, ah.  Jesus Christ.  I goofed on him on the E show.  Now he's getting me back.  Third surprise in the show today.  That's the biggest surprise.  Ah.  Oh, Christ.  Don't pick up two.  No?  No. 
[110:30]
 Not ready to drop that bombshell yet.  This is a multifaceted assault.  Kelly.  How you doing, guys?  Good. What's up?  I'm a phone sex operator.  I want to adopt you some phone sex  since you don't have a relationship anymore.  Who's saying that?  Well, I think you are, but in close situations.  Well, Kelly, let's hear what you got.  Just, yeah, let's hear your stuff.  You can't say the dirty words.  I can't say the dirty words?  No, let's substitute stupid words for that. 
[111:00]
 Right, like slung and a member.  Yeah, no.  No, all right, we'll give you all the code words.  For the male stuff, just say junk.  Junk.  For like, for your like back door.  Are you writing all this down?  I'm serious.  I'm writing it down.  All right, for the back door on you,  because, you know, that should be part of your little fantasy here.  Sure.  Just say balloon knot.  Balloon?  Not.  Balloon knot.  Not.  You're writing all this down, right? 
[111:30]
 Yeah.  Okay, the front door.  Yeah.  Refer to it as the whale's eye.  My front door.  Yes.  Yeah.  What's your front door?  That's the junk.  That's the junk?  Yeah.  What about the things in between?  Isn't that the junk?  Well, yeah, I mean, you could say the twigs and berries and all that.  No, but just say junk.  Your junk.  I want to take your junk.  You know what I'm saying?  Well, Anthony, I want to take your junk.  You got to...  Well, that's some foreplay there, huh?  Okay.  You want some foreplay?  There's a little touching.  You want some foreplay? 
[112:00]
 Nah, that's right.  Put my junk in your mouth, you're right.  I'll come in and do the Toothpick and Homework Club.  All right, we're calling you up, right?  And we're spending a bloody fortune.  Now get into it.  Well, if you're spending a bloody fortune,  then you want me to put your junk in my mouth right away.  All right, but...  Guys call me up and I get picked.  This call is $9.95 per minute.  Get the voice going, though.  Yeah, you just sound like you're ragging.  Go ahead, we're ready.  I'm not ragging.  I really am a phone sex operator. 
[112:30]
 All right, we're ready for you.  Put on your phone sex voice.  Let's go.  Here we go.  Hi, Anthony.  How are you today?  Very good.  You're very good?  Well, why don't you take your clothes off for me?  Opie would look at me funny.  I'm sitting here naked.  Well, why doesn't Opie leave the room?  Or he can take his junk out.  All right, let's just say I have my clothes off.  You have your clothes off for me?  Yes.  Well, why don't you sit in front of your computer screen for me?  It's right there in front of me.  Oh, really?  Why don't you play with it for me? 
[113:00]
 You're drunk, that is.  Oh, oh, all of a sudden I was going to my Internet Explorer web browser.  Bit confusing.  All right, here we go.  I'm like, are you stroking it for me?  Are you stoking it for me?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Stoking it for me?  Like the water pump scene in the Helen Keller movie.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going at it.  Oh, yeah, baby.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I want to see you shoot a big one for me today.  What, a moose?  Are you going to do that for me? 
[113:30]
 Oh, I thought we were hunting.  No, are you going to shoot one for me today?  Yes.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Where do you like to shoot it?  Where?  Yeah, if I was there with you right now, where would you want to shoot it for me?  Uh, put it this way.  It would look like you had cataracts.  The way you would see out of your eyes.  Oh, really?  It would look like you need the laser surgery.  Yeah?  Yeah, that's where it would go.  Really?  Oh, I like that.  I'll forget about it.  Oh, I could end up...  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  That's great. 
[114:00]
 Is this too much for you?  No, no, it's just fine.  It's just fine?  Can you work in the balloon knot?  The balloon knot?  Yeah.  Yeah, work in the balloon knot.  The balloon knot?  Well, you know what?  I want you to bend me over.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I want you to put your...  You can't use descriptive terms.  Yeah, you've got to use our code words.  Okay.  You can say done.  Okay.  You could be talking about an old Chevy. 
[114:30]
 So you're bent over.  I'm bent over.  Yeah.  Yeah, you got your junk out, so...  Oh, my junk is out.  Yeah, is it nice and hard for me?  Oh, it's like Sprint Sanford's house.  It's out.  It's all over the place.  Is it nice and hard for me?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Very difficult.  Oh, baby.  Oh, why don't you stick it right inside that balloon knot of mine?  That nice tight balloon knot.  That's just stupid.  That's not even sexy.  You can't have phone sex and say balloon knot.  That does sound wacky, doesn't it?  It's just dumb. 
[115:00]
 Look, she's getting all pissed off.  All right, let's work the whale's eye into the situation.  Whale's eye, okay.  Whale's eye, Anthony.  It's very wet right now.  Is it?  Very.  Well, it's a whale's eye.  It's got to be wet.  It's a whale's eye.  Exactly.  It would die on land.  All right, wait.  I got...  Can we go back to the balloon knot?  Go back to the balloon knot?  Yeah, instead of saying balloon knot, use the word hoop.  Hoop.  Fur, hoop.  Fur, hoop?  Yeah. 
[115:30]
 Why fur?  It's not furry.  Okay, leather Cheerio.  Leather Cheerio?  Okay, baby.  All right, so now Ann's got his junk.  Yeah.  He's got his junk.  Okay.  He's rubbing it right up against that leather Cheerio of mine.  Oh, yeah?  Right up against it, baby.  Mm-hmm.  You want to put it in there?  You want to make me scream?  Are you clean?  Oh, yeah, baby.  Very clean.  Let's hope so. 
[116:00]
 Doesn't look like a chocolate starfish.  No, it doesn't.  There's no chocolate involved here.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, really.  I don't want to get done and have it look like a fudgy cult.  No.  No, I don't take in that.  That's good.  That's a whole different thing that guys call me up for, and that's really disgusting.  All right, you know, I'm kind of getting into this.  Can I add in my own fantasy?  Of course.  You can say whatever you want.  All right, Kelly, you're laying down on the bed.  I'm laying down on the bed.  I got my legs spread out, but can I say that?  That's good. 
[116:30]
 Yeah, you're on your back.  Yeah.  You're completely naked.  Completely.  I got my junk out, right?  That's right.  I'm working my way up towards your head.  You know what I mean?  Like I'm kneeling on the bed.  I'm working my way up right towards your head.  And oh, I take a picture.  Yeah, baby, give it to me.  Look, she's got to go with it because it's a bum thing.  Oh, yeah, give it to me.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, they say that.  Biggest dump on my face.  They say that.  And you just roll your eyes on the other end of the room. 
[117:00]
 Oh, totally.  I'm like sitting there eating Cheetos and they're talking about taking a dump on my face.  Yeah, I want to do that.  It's so disgusting.  Put a big Groucho Marx mustache on you.  No, these guys call up and they have these fetishes with watching women  like take a dump and go to the bathroom.  Yeah, they must have seen our underground website.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, they're really sick.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, Kelly, you ever get into phone sex, Anthony, though?  What? Phone sex?  Yeah.  Oh, that old gag. 
[117:30]
 I tried it once, but the receiver got stuck in my ass.  No, I'm not into phone sex or computer sex.  Goddamn, Opie used to sit there for hours on the computer,  making like he was having sex with these chicks.  My name is Jeanine, 18 year old bi.  Yeah, you're talking to Ralph and he's 65.  I couldn't like phone sex or computer sex.  I like the sex sex. 
[118:00]
 Well, I like that too, but sometimes you don't have a toy.  All right, Kelly, we're done with you.  Well, thank you.  A little nod in your whale's eye.  Glad I could take a dump on your face.  Oh, I'm glad too.  It was very amusing.  Thanks for sharing your hoop with us.  Anytime, baby.  All right, Kelly.  Bye, hon.  Bye.  There she goes.  Phone sex operator with an out of phone sex voice.  Hey, Taylor, you're next on the show.  What's up?  Hey, Opie, you let the cat out of the bag like two weeks ago about Anthony.  What do you mean?  What did he say?  You guys were talking about getting busted with a hooker. 
[118:30]
 Yeah.  And you made a comment towards Anthony like,  well, Anthony would know about that.  Why?  I never said that.  Yeah, it was like two or three weeks ago.  You guys were talking about getting busted with like another woman or a hooker.  There's no hookers involved.  There's no hookers or getting busted or anything.  So Anthony, you weren't busted with another chick.  No, that isn't what happened.  It's not what happened.  No.  No, it's much better than that. 
[119:00]
 It's much better than that?  Anthony got busted with spaz?  We're just waiting for Anthony to decide what he wants to say.  I want TSL.  This is going to take a while.  All right, Michael.  All right, Prano's in here.  Thank you, Taylor.  All right, Rittero.  All right, man.  I don't remember that.  Okay, let's take a break.  We'll be back. 
[119:30]
 This is debauchery mania.  Prostate exams for everyone.  1027 WNEW, we're back.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's FU Friday.  Hey, Anthony controlling the effuse today, looks like.  What?  Me?  Oh, yeah.  No one's going to tap your FU today.  Yeah.  Tom from Jersey writes, Opie, I got the Lasik surgery on my eyes a while back.  When I opened them for the first time, the doc had his bill for the procedure for me to read. 
[120:00]
 That was that was the scariest part of the operation right there.  Everything else went fine.  Go for it tomorrow.  Thank you, Tom.  You are going tomorrow.  Yeah, I guess.  Oh, got it.  It makes me like blink hard when I think about the procedure.  It's a slicer.  The procedure.  Hey, Matt, you're next on the show.  What's up?  Opie and Anthony, you guys rule, bro.  All right.  You guys are the best.  Yo, I got a good sex story. 
[120:30]
 My friend used to do a lot of sex and he met one of these chicks.  Yeah.  Ugly.  No better way to describe it.  Not ugly.  Bad as can be.  Well, that's what a lot of them are.  They just have to have a good voice.  That's all.  You got a better goatee than I did, bro.  It's like the Aerosmith video.  That's that.  And he saw his thoughts with the computer,  trying to get on a computer with these chicks.  Yeah.  They get worse.  All right.  Worse.  Well, thank you, Matt.  All right, guys. 
[121:00]
 You guys suck.  All right.  Another girl wants to try it out here.  Matt, the helicopter was leaving me at the base.  Who's that?  This is a blonde girl.  A blonde girl?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, what's going on?  OK.  Well, I told the staff that I was calling to have sex with Anthony, too.  Actually, I'd rather said Opie, but whatever.  Oh, yeah?  Why are you breathing heavy and stuff?  Am I?  Yeah.  I don't know.  It must be talking to you. 
[121:30]
 So you want to have the phone sex?  Sure.  Have some of Opie.  Are you tired, Anthony?  Yeah.  That last one just exhausted me.  I missed the tail end of it getting out of the car,  but I guess it did.  I took a dump on her face.  That's how it ended.  A bunch of people on the answer feedback said,  you know, I was in the mood for sex tonight,  and after hearing that lady, forget about it.  That really got me off.  Yeah.  What can you do for us?  Well, you have to fill me in on the code word.  I know that you're junk, but you have to fill me in on the code word.  All right. 
[122:00]
 Our stuff is our junk, OK?  Back door is the balloon knot.  It's the balloon knot.  No, you can either.  No, I don't like that term.  That's just not going to do it for me.  All right.  Use hoop.  OK.  Your hoop.  Your hoop.  OK.  And the front's got to be the whale's eye, I guess.  No, that doesn't do it for me either.  Hatchet wound.  Hatchet wound?  Yeah, that's a good one.  Can we stick to one word?  Yeah, you got to talk in the codes or they'll dump out of her show.  Right, right, right.  Um, hmm. 
[122:30]
 Your, your, uh,  fatch.  Your patch.  Your, what can you call him?  I always said whale's eye.  She wants one word.  OK, for lack of anything better, we'll go with that.  OK.  And, uh, your boobs are your knobs.  OK.  All right, you got them written down?  Yep.  OK, good job.  And action.  Action.  Wow, hold on, hold on, hold on. 
[123:00]
 Who are we going with here?  Uh, OPI.  I have to get the visual.  OPI.  Go with OPI.  What's the location?  Um, what's the location?  Like I'm on my couch.  Oh, OK.  And I'm calling.  So you're calling like after the show?  Yeah.  Or before the show?  Or before the operation?  Just whatever.  Go ahead.  Here I am.  Waiting for you.  Go ahead.  OK.  Hi, how you doing tonight?  Good, how are you?  Good, good, good. 
[123:30]
 So, uh, are you dressed?  Yeah, I'm dressed.  What are you wearing?  Um, boxer shorts and a t-shirt.  Well, aren't you kind of hot  wearing those boxer shorts and a t-shirt?  Do you do this for a living?  Why?  Like, get into it.  Yeah, get dirty.  Get dirty.  I'm a little nervous.  I'm a little nervous.  All right.  OK.  Like pull down my pants.  Let's go.  All right, all right, all right. 
[124:00]
 All right.  What are you calling the Switch's phone service?  Come on, Hall, get into it.  Hurry up, put your tongue to my well-by.  Hurry, hurry, hurry.  Why do I have to hurry?  Because I can't wait.  Turn over.  I want to, I want your hoop.  That sucks. 
[124:30]
 All right, hold on.  Hold on a second.  Lisa.  Hey, Lisa.  Hi.  Hi, how you doing?  Your husband thinks you should do phone sex?  Why?  No, it's actually my husband's best friend.  And...  Interesting.  It's funny because whenever, when the weather changes, my voice gets deeper.  And usually he's in telecommunications. 
[125:00]
 Usually when he calls me on his cell phone, my husband's best friend,  he's looking for my husband.  It's like, hi, how you doing?  OK, all right, bye.  OK, well, when the weather changes and my voice gets very deep,  it's like, hi, how you doing?  Oh, wow, it's so nice to talk to you.  And he won't hang up.  And it's like the longest conversations I've ever had with him.  Because he obviously likes guys.  Well...  If your voice gets deeper and stuff.  Yeah.  So he always said that I should do nine, seven, six numbers. 
[125:30]
 We used a lot of money.  Are you going to try out and do it here now?  For us?  I don't know.  Give it a try.  OK.  Hi, how you doing?  Hi, I'm a 35-year-old virgin.  Oh, you're a virgin.  I've never seen a hoop before or a well-seed.  You've never seen a hoop?

 No, and I've never gotten a hummer and I've never touched a woman's knobs, ever.  Oh, my goodness.  What can you do for me?  I'm very nervous.  You're very nervous about?  I have my junk out right now.  Well, you should just relax.  I'm manipulating my junk and I'm thinking of your hoop.  You're thinking of my hoop?  Well, have you ever played basketball?  You could do a slam dunk.  Oh, really?  In your hoop?  Yeah.  Can I do that?  Oh, yes. 
[126:30]
 But don't touch the couch, bud.  Oh, no, no, no.  Is your junk out?  Oh, yeah.  Pulling out?  It's out.  I have trouble with your premature junkulation, so don't get me too hot.  Don't get you too hot?  Yes, or my couch will look like I dropped a glazed donut on it.  Well, I think what you should do is just close your eyes, lean back, and think of my hoop.

 That is a tough job, huh?  It is.  Well, you gave it a great shot, though, Lisa.  Well, thank you very much.  All right.  Take care.  Bye-bye.  Have a great weekend.  She's all set.  They missed close to this.  They're being polite.  Awesome.  Girls can really do that.  Hey, Chris, you're next on WNEW.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  All right.  Hey, you got a bang the radio chick now? 
[127:30]
 Yeah.  You're my hero, man.  No.  She's got some great pictures on the WNEW website we were checking out today.  I can't wait to get home, man.  Oh, wow.  I think the man's going to get the voice now.  We got to get ready, Maggie.  I can't live without Biggie Moss.  I'm out of here.  Maybe you can make a trade, my bud.  Make a trade?  Right.  We'll put them all in a hot big name. 
[128:00]
 All right.  Let's take a break. </pre>
