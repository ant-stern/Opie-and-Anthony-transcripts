<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with a discussion of their recent legal troubles ("F.U. Friday") and Opie's recounting of a positive sexual encounter.  They then celebrated their ranking as the sixth most talked-about radio personalities on Deja.com, according to Yahoo Internet Magazine. This led into a critique of Mayor Rudy Giuliani's proposed car confiscation policy.  A major portion of the show focused on the aftermath of their previous altercation with The Rock, and his upcoming return.  Listeners called in expressing both excitement and trepidation about the impending confrontation.  The hosts played several listener-submitted comedic "rock songs" mocking The Rock, and brainstormed strategies for his return, ranging from protective gear to encouraging listener heckling.  The WWF contacted them about another interaction with The Rock, but without an apology for the previous incident. The hosts considered playing more mocking songs during his appearance.  The show included various listener calls. One involved a prank call where a listener was falsely told he'd won $100,000; he only won a candy bar. Another caller raved about Adam Ferrara's stand-up act at the Governor's Comedy Club. Several Boston callers discussed the show's return to the Boston market after their firing for an April Fool's Day prank announcing the Boston mayor's death. A caller strongly defended The Rock and criticized the hosts.  The hosts frequently used vulgar language and offensive humor throughout.

The discussion then shifted to The Rock's upcoming return for a second interview. The hosts expressed nervousness and excitement, hoping to provoke him again.  They sought advice from callers and planned strategies, considering the involvement of publicist Jay Moore.  A significant portion was devoted to a graphic and sexually charged discussion of photos of Leslie Gold, the previous show's host, that appeared on the WNEW website.  The hosts described the pictures in explicit detail, making numerous crude and sexually suggestive comments. Callers speculated on Anthony's borough of residence (Brooklyn), offered opinions on The Rock and the upcoming interview, and shared various anecdotes. One caller detailed their LASIK surgery, leading to a lengthy discussion with other callers sharing their own experiences, both positive and negative. Another caller recounted their uncle's negative experience with the procedure.  Opie's upcoming LASIK surgery and Anthony's marital problems, compared to Howard Stern's situation, were recurring topics. A caller relayed The Rock's negative comments about the hosts overheard at a bar.

The show continued with Anthony's marital problems being the initial focus, with speculation about Howard Stern's involvement.  The hosts then engaged in several sexually explicit phone conversations with different women. The first was a phone sex operator, Kelly,  using invented code words for body parts and sexual acts. A blonde caller then engaged in a similar conversation with Opie, utilizing the same code words.  Lisa, a third female caller, whose husband's best friend encouraged her to explore phone sex due to her voice changing with the weather, also participated in a role-play with Opie using the established code words.  The hosts referenced Anthony's legal issues, "Spaz," and ongoing jokes about his alleged indiscretions. Listeners called in with related anecdotes, including a humorous LASIK experience and another about a friend's experience with phone sex.  The segment concluded with brief conversations with additional callers.

[00:04:30]  For trying to now take cars away  From drivers like myself  Hall, did you hear this one?  What happened?  Can you explain it to the people?  Well, he wants to  Like with the drunk driving  How he repossesses your car  Now if you're caught doing  Double the speed limit  You're going to repossess your car  On the spot  Like me and you  And all the guys at LIE  Doing about 100 on the shoulder  You know, I want to like this damn guy  I'll admit it  I want to like him  But God, he just makes it so freaking difficult 
[00:05:00]  That's insane  You cannot take away cars  Now, you know  We said this with the drunk driving  Someone gets caught driving drunk  They take your car away  Before you're convicted or anything  They just take your car  And everyone was saying  Oh, it's a great idea  And we were saying  No  It's just the first step  Right  To taking away your car  For something else  And now it's this  You know what it's going to get to the point?  If you're parking  In a no parking zone  We'll tow your car  And you will never ever  Get it back again  Don't laugh, man  That's how it starts  It always starts this way 
[00:05:30]  We're giving away too many of our freedoms  In this country  So double  Just take your car away  To speed them  Wait, if you're doing double the speed limit  Yeah, it's in Billing News today  Now, does this mean  Like, what?  60 in a 30?  I guess so  Because that's  I've done that  No, the only way they say  Is reckless driving  And then they ask  The definition of reckless driving  And they say like  Switching three lanes  Oh, that's one example  Oh, so even switching three lanes?  Yeah, there you go  There's reckless driving  Oh, come on, I do that all the time  There's some asswipe  In the left and middle lane 
[00:06:00]  You've got to swing  You've got to go around  You've got to go all the way around  I don't know if it's at the trooper's discretion  I would take this  You know, why doesn't the mayor wake up  And get all these  Unlicensed, uninsured drivers  Off the road  Before they start effing with us  Yeah, get the idea  On the left lane doing 50  I mean, there are some serious problems  On the roadways  There's so many people out there  Right now  That could get into a nasty accident  With you  And you're not going to get a cent  I know  Because they're uninsured  Unlicensed  Don't even own the car they're driving  Because they stole it  Gypsy cabs 
[00:06:30]  Gypsy cabs  All that crap  Take care of all that  Before you start taking more of our freedoms away  Oh my God  Why not just put all our cars on tracks  Like the Disneyland  What is that?  The Autotopia?  Remember that?  Where you just  Like little five-year-old  Smelling exhaust fumes  In that pit  And it's on a track  And you can't go fast  That'd make him happy  He doesn't have to worry about it  Wherever he goes  There's sirens blaring  And he's in a limousine or something  Or one of those trucks 
[00:07:00]  Doing 90 miles an hour  Yeah  Doing 90  So he doesn't know how to drive  To sit in traffic  Let him and his goddamn comb over  Sit on the 59th Street Bridge  And not drive on the sidewalk  Oh  That would have got my car taken away  But goddamn  I was so proud of that move  I drove on the sidewalk  We bowed  We bowed to you  We had your moves  But  We had to make it to  Goldfinger  Next time that happens  Your car will be taken away  Yeah  Now cars will be taken away  Alright Mike  Thank you  Is that a train?  Alright  No  You did a good job 
[00:07:30]  I wonder if that  That move where I backed  Down the one-way street  So my car was facing the right way  But I'm driving the wrong way  Backwards  To get to Goldfinger  Remember that one?  I wonder if that would be  A confiscating offense  That was one of the  The most  We had so much fun that night man  I looked in the rear view mirror  I just saw Earl  And he had turned white  He looked like that scene  In The Little Rascals  Yeah  Where Stymie got scared  And his eyes got big and white 
[00:08:00]  Yeah  Like that  And he was like  Whoa  That was Earl  He was petrified at my driving  I was on the sidewalk  I'm just sitting there  I'll relax  I'm used to this  If I'm not scared  You shouldn't be scared  I've been driving with this guy  For five years so  I'm going to have to watch myself now  You know what though  I swear  I want to like Rudy Giuliani  I'm not going to lie  Yeah  I want to like him  But every time you turn around  Or open the paper  He's doing something  That just  Gets you pissed off  Yeah  I mean this is too far

[00:24:30]  Walking out on our show last  The rock  The croc says  The croc says  Tom you're next on the O.P. and Anthony show  On WNEW  What's up  Hey what's up guys  I wanted to say  I got a little bit more about that Giuliani story  With the cars  I'm right with you guys  I want to like the guy  But at the same time  He's pulled out on five different offenses  It was like if you get caught tailgating twice 
[00:25:00]  They're taking your car away  And there's certain places on the west side of the highway  You're running  You know  Uh oh  Tom  Ant's going to answer you  In the same  The same way you asked your question  Yeah  And Tom's phone hung up  Tom call back  Your cell phone crapped out on us  But it's a very scary thing  And it's very unacceptable 
[00:25:30]  Yeah  This whole new Rudy thing  Confiscating cars  If you're going what  Twice the speed limit  And things like that  Yeah  Unacceptable  We don't like it  No one likes it  I mean  And no one should like it  I love the rube they find  That always says  I think it's a good idea  It'll get the maniacs off the road  That's the person that makes you into a maniac  That person  They don't know how to drive  Two miles an hour  You try to pass them  And you wind up looking like a maniac  And now there's a risk of losing your car 
[00:26:00]  Yeah  We'll all just ride big wheels  Into Manhattan  We'll all be on our little big wheels  Everyone will be safe  Alright  You want another rock song Anthony?  Yeah sure  Also from Airsick Productions  It's very short  But very funny  Here it is  Look how brave we are now that he's gone 
[00:26:30]  Yeah I know  Ron what's up?  Hey ONA  Listen  Dwayne's of course  Dwayne Johnson  Me and my buddy Chaney  And my buddy Mazur  We got signs made up  We're going to be sitting front row  Madison Square Garden  To say  ONA  Kick the rocks  Rudy Poe  Can be air  Yeah  Alright  He is a  Can't breathe  Wannabe whip 
[00:27:00]  Don't forget  He had fat sucked out of his man breasts  He had the fat sucked out of every part of his sissy body  He got that liposuction  They sucked the big fat man breast right off his chest  You know when he was nothing  He was a lot more humble  You guys got to stop giving idiots like him the exposure  Because  You know  These guys they get big  And they forget why they got big  Well we were taken I guess  We've had some good experiences with some of the wrestlers  You know Chris Jericho  Gave a great interview  Chris Jericho is a great guy 
[00:27:30]  Great interview  Even the road dog  The second time we had him on  A lot of fun we had with him  Al Snow  Was a pisser  Hysterical  Doesn't take himself too seriously  Like the croc  Let's not forget Shane and Vince  Shane and Vince have always been fun  They too don't take themselves all that seriously  They know it's a big gag  You're a joke  You're in wrestling  We're a joke  We're a couple of idiots  That just talk on the radio  We understand that  We don't take ourselves seriously  But the rock  All of a sudden  Now the rock  Has a racial 
[00:28:00]  Political agenda  Rock  You're a dopey  Big doofus wrestler  With a stupid closing move  And why didn't you tell him  You know he's going to forget  What he comes from  Well I had other things on my mind  All right Ron  Thank you  Thanks guys  Bye  You're all brave now  But he's ten feet away  You couldn't say any of that stuff  There's fear for my life  Why did I say it while he's here  I had to sleep on it  That's what it was  I had to mow it over  I wonder if we would do it differently 
[00:28:30]  If he walked in now  Knowing what we know  Hell yeah  If we just went in a time capsule  Or a time machine  And were transported back  And didn't know anything  I think it would end up the same way  Because we wouldn't know  But if he like walked in right now  Right now  I'd get up  I'd run away  As fast as I can  Walt  Yeah  What's up  I don't mind me  When I forgot where  I understood  Book signing from the rock  Yeah  I said hey  He wouldn't sign your book 
[00:29:00]  Not my book  My friend's book  Really  Yeah  It just proves he's a crybaby  You ever noticed  That he looks like  Deuce Bigelow on steroids  Yeah  That's pretty funny  He does  That's very good  Alright man  Alright Walt  Doctor  Take that liposuction tube  Shine it up real nice  Turn that sumbitch sideways  And suck the fat  Out of my man breast  You candy ass  Bob 
[00:29:30]  Hey guys  What's up  Hey what's up  Now you know  You're talking about  You're just saying  How he got the fat  Sucked out of his breast  Sure  That's not what he had done  He had  He had an operation  He had lumps  Taken out around  It's from  Like meatloaf  And fight club  Exactly  From the movie  He  He said it was liposuction  But it wasn't liposuction  Because I had the same thing done  And he's got to lay off  The sustenine  And the d-balls 
[00:30:00]  And all the other crap  That he's doing  We can't  That's where his anger management  Remember how  He has an anger problem  Well there you go  It's from the juice  Alright Bob  It's one of the number one symptoms  Thank you  Alright guys  Burn in hell  Alright bye  Burn in hell  We can't really confirm  What Bob's saying  Obviously  Of course not  That's what Bob thinks  Okay  Speculated  That wrestlers are on steroids  They always speculate  That's okay  You know what  What bums me out  I was reading a lot of email  A lot of people think  You and I are a bunch of pussies  How we handle the rock thing 
[00:30:30]  And stuff  I know  I understand  And I can see how people  Would get that impression  Tell you the truth  But we were just trying  To explain ourselves  And be courteous  You know  Right  The rock is in our home  Over here  And we have to be courteous  Mike  What's up  How are you  What's up guys  The very beginning  Of Smackdown last night  I don't know if you guys saw  But just for a second  Don't watch wrestling  I'm sorry  And someone called me  A crybaby yesterday  Alright then I'm a crybaby  Don't watch it  Don't even like it anymore

Oh Paul 
[01:10:30]  Alright  I need my water  No I'm dying of thirst here  Go back to the phones  Hey Chris what's up today?  Yeah fellas  I'm kind of a little disappointed today  I made this beautiful sign  To bring to the garden on Sunday  I'm going  I don't know whether I should bring it now  I don't want to cause any trouble  Between you and him  You know?  No go ahead  Bring all the signs  Really?  It's still on  Yeah  It's beautiful  It says hey Rock  Eat your heart out  And steal the show 
[01:11:00]  Love Opie and Anthony  Alright  I've got a picture of you guys  From the magazine on there  Honestly  You know  We're still very very pissed off  At the Rock  And very pissed off  At the WWF  We'll see what happens Thursday  Let me tell you something  About this whole thing  The Rock is coming in next Thursday  I got the call from the WWF today  They didn't explain anything  They didn't apologize  Nothing  They didn't tell us why  You know the Rock acted like he did  Blah blah blah  But I'm  This is not  Fake  Yeah  I'm surprised they even agreed  To let him come on 
[01:11:30]  If you got that resolved on the phone  This isn't fake though  I will not accept that today  From our listeners  If like someone that doesn't like the show  Wants to pound us  With an instant feedback  Or a phone call  Saying this is definitely fake  It's a set up  You know you guys did this all along  Whatever  But the faithful listeners  Got to understand  This is not  No  Fake  I know it  Absolutely not  We were really pissed off  When Rock came in here  And left  He looked like a crybaby  You know he blindsided us  We had nothing to do with  What he was claiming 
[01:12:00]  Man to man  I told him  Look I have no idea  What you're talking about  He still was  You know like a little crybaby  And walked out on us  Yeah  No question  I know  I was uncomfortable  Driving in the car  And I can imagine  How you guys felt  Fetched to face with him  And he's coming back  This Thursday  And it's going to be  Interesting radio  Because I  If I back down  A second time  I'll never forgive myself  I'm serious  That's going to be rough  It's going to be a weird day  But don't  Don't  Don't even  Begin to think  That this is all a set up 
[01:12:30]  Because it's not  No I don't think  It's a set up at all  Well a bunch of people  Are pounding us  And I swear to God  You know  Well like you said  The faithful listeners  Like me  Know it was the real deal  Well it's hard to believe  Anything  As far as wrestling  Is concerned  You know  When  What's his name  Died  Owen Hart  Owen Hart  When Owen Hart died  Like I didn't think  He was really dead  Right  So obviously  People are going to think  It's some kind of  A wrestling angle  To have the rock  Pissed at us  If it's an angle  We don't know anything 
[01:13:00]  About it  And that's the guy's  Honest truth  No clue  But I don't think it is  Because he was really  You know  Bummed out  And the words  Ethan Steele  On my sign  Are in bold print  Alright Chris  Good  Very good  Thank you  Alright bye  Another Chris on the line  What's up Chris  Oh hey  What's up  Hey  Alright  I just want to give  A F you out  To the guy  Who was just about  Front row center  With a man cow  Wow sign  On a smack down  Life  That was pretty frustrating  Can I

[01:23:30]  And once again  A bunch of faxes  And none we can really  Read on the air  Because they're  They're pointless really  So keep trying  Fax line  212-957-9639  Let's go to Joe  Joe what's going on  Hey Opie  Hey  How you doing  Alright  You said you were scared  Let me tell you something  About the laser surgery  About the laser surgery  See I didn't even want  To bring this up on the air  You know I think  Most calls you're going to get  It's going to be positive  This being one of them  I had it done  Last September  And it's unbelievable 
[01:24:00]  I'm sitting at my computer  Prior to getting surgery  I couldn't read the computer screen  The big E on the chart  Forget about it  You know  It was just a big blur  Next day  The day after the surgery  I'm reading my neighbor's  License plate  From across the street  I couldn't tell  What kind of car it was  Before  I love you guys  That get the surgery  You talk about like  How you're just walking around  Reading things now  And it's like amazing  Let me tell you something  To this day  A year later  Every once in a while  I'm driving around  And I'll look and go 
[01:24:30]  Man this is incredible  Yeah see  And you don't understand  Because you never really  You never had glasses  Right  You don't understand  What do you wear  Opie  Context or glasses  Glasses right now  I used to wear contacts  But it was just  It was a nightmare  It sounds crazy  And I guess  Unless you wear contacts  If the five minutes  It takes to wash them  You know in the morning  What a pain in the ass  Yeah  What a pain in the ass  It would be nice  To just walk outside  And be able to see stuff  Without putting my glasses on  And all that kind  But you struck a nerve with me  When you said how afraid you were 
[01:25:00]  Yeah  I'm freaking  I'm not going to lie  I skydive  I remember what my first jump was  I had a malfunction  Where my mane didn't open  I had to go to reserve  Let me tell you something  I was more scared  Going in for the surgery  Than jumping out of a plane  Than jumping out of the plane  I'm telling you  But  Yeah I wake up every day  I'm going to do it  And then like by the end of the day  I'm like  No I can't do that  Yeah  Well it helped me  When I went there  I watched someone going through it  Now  It's a little  It's a little gruesome to watch it 
[01:25:30]  I don't know where you're having it done  Maybe you don't want to say  But  I'm sure you did your research on your doc  Yes  Big time  And  You know  The one thing I learned  If you are going to get this laser surgery done  You've got to do the research on the doctor  Because this procedure is getting so huge  That  A lot of these doctors are getting a weekend course  And then they're doing it  Yeah pretty soon a dentist will be able to do it  With the drill  To hang a shingle out  Right  Yeah because I mean  They're getting certified to do the surgery  Pretty much every weekend 
[01:26:00]  A bunch of people  So  You've got to find someone that has done  An S load of these  Absolutely  And that's key  You know  And the guy  I spoke to so many people  You know  I was friends of friends  Yeah give me his number  Let me call him  And I got a lot of positive  Positive feedback on it  So that kind of helped  But  You do it  The only thing  I was talking to Spaz before  He was asking me  It's not painful  But it's a lot more  Uncomfortable  Than they lead you to believe it was it  At least the guy's being honest 
[01:26:30]  I'm going to tell you straight out  They put this thing  In your clockwork orange  You guys saw the movie I'm sure  Yes  The thing that holds the eye open  Is called the  I think a scapula  If I remember correctly  Man that thing hurts  When they put it on  And your eye is wide open  Then they put  You have a LASIK done right  Yeah  Then they put this device  Anthony  It's like a  Listen to Anthony Freak  Because he's more  Screamish than I  It's a mechanical plane  And what it does  It slides across  The top of your eye 
[01:27:00]  And it slices  The corny  If I remember correctly  Wow  Just about  Like 95% of the way through  Wow  Then he takes  A pair of tweezers  Yes this is it  Go go  And he flips  He flips that  That flap  That he just created  By the slice over  Yeah  And once he does that  Here's where I got scared  Going through it  You go blind  You don't see any light  Everything goes black  Your eye is open  And you're blind 
[01:27:30]  Right  Because what he did is  He just took off  The part of the eye  That you're looking through  Yeah like that  Like every part of your eye  Is necessary  Exactly  It's not like extra parts  So when they remove  The top of your cornea  You don't want to just  Slice this off and lose it  No  So how long are you blind for?  As long as it takes  The laser to do its thing  And what you  And I told him  I must have left my fingerprints  In the chair rails  Because I'm squeezing  For all I'm working  I'm not going tomorrow  I'm not going 
[01:28:00]  I'm not going to sit here  And act brave  I'm a boss  Opie you're taking this wrong  I'm trying to talk you into  So how long  How long did it take  How long did you have  Your flap flapped open  I'd say  I'd say about 15 seconds  Because what you do  When he flaps open  Everything goes black  But you can still see  There's a red dot  On the laser  And he says  Just stare at the red dot  And I'm like  Doc I can't see the dot  He goes  You're doing  You know  At that point  When I couldn't see it 
[01:28:30]  I'm just concentrating  On holding my eyeball  Still  Alright  I'm looking at the same spot  I'm looking at the same spot  And you hear the laser  And it's like  It sounds like  A tick tick tick tick tick  And what it does  It just  It burns off  And burns probably  The wrong term  It's like  It's like a cold laser  I believe  And it just shaves down  The cornea  To the proper curvature  And then that stops  He flips the thing over  And you can start  Seeing again  Everything's blurry as hell  This is one eye 
[01:29:00]  I'm talking about  Oh my  He does one eye at a time  Obviously  He flips it over  You start seeing light again  You make out images  From going completely blind  And black  You can actually see  You know  Shapes and colors  Oh boy  Shapes and colors  Yeah  I'll tell you  Let me tell you  Well once they do that  They're done with the eye  You relax  And they do the same thing  To the other eye  This is why  I did not  Go ahead  That takes about  10 maybe 15 minutes  Between the time they stop 
[01:29:30]  Your rest period  Between the left eye  And the right eye  I get up out of the chair  And walk outside  And before I went in  For the surgery  I looked out the window  And I tried to read something  Across the way  It was a big Nordstrom sign  And let me tell you something  That big sign on the side  Of the building  Was hard to see  When I went in  When I came out  It was blurry as hell  But guess what  I can actually see it  Oh man  So  Oh boy 
[01:30:00]  It's unbelievable  Alright  And I got a little  How long ago  Did you have it done?  Last September  If I can  If you'll give me a chance  I'll go on real quick  Go ahead  Looking at  Later on that day  My vision's not getting any better  Here's where I started  Worrying again  Holy  Holy  Yes  What I do to my eyes  Everything's blurry  There's a double vision  And I'm getting real nervous  I went to bed that night  The next morning I woke up  I had 2015 vision  And it's overnight 
[01:30:30]  You go from seeing blurry  To seeing better than you ever did in your life  Alright Joe  Hey  All the bad stuff  Yeah  It's worth it  You know  Before you just said  I'm not doing it  Do it  I'm telling you  It's amazing  And it's worth the money you pay for it  Wow  That's one man's opinion  Now of course  Maybe someone will give you a call a little later  Telling you that  You know  They see double vision  Hey how do they fasten that flap back 
[01:31:00]  The eye has  Again  It's  What I was told  I get to put a layman's turn  So I understand  But the eye has like a natural sucking action  And when they  Ah  Come on  You said all the wrong words  It's like a pulsing action  When they flip the cornea back down  It kind of sucks itself back on  And then eventually  That incision that they made  With that plane  Heals itself  Would you just be afraid to blink  That it's going to flap off 
[01:31:30]  Well you know  Took us  He says you know  Don't shout  Don't stare up at the shower  And you know  I'm protecting my eyes  They give you  They give you the goggles  To put on too  Goggles  What  Actually you know what  You know what  Holy Jesus  You've got to come in here  Wearing goggles  I'll wet myself  The old man in Florida  Type glasses  The Terminator glasses  Terminator glasses  You got it  You got to wear the Terminator  My name is  Joe Pink  Hi  You're having it done tomorrow  I don't know  Alright Joe 
[01:32:00]  Thank you  Alright  Well I hope I was able  To give you a little insight  And give you some positive feedback  It's  Wow  That's all  You know  That's the gruesome details  I went through  But do it  Alright  It changes your life  Thank you  It really does  Thank you  Alright guys  Take care  There goes Joe  This won't hurt a bit  Johnny you're next on the show  What's up  Hey what's up guys  How you doing  Hey  Hey  Hey I got a couple things  For both of you guys 
[01:32:30]  One  Oh  With regards to  That laser surgery  Yes  A buddy of mine  Had a fish hook in his eye  We were out fishing  And that's disgusting man  That's all I can think about  And also  If you got to wear short and curly  I mean you got to wear those  What happens if you get a short curly in there man  You get a short curly in your eye  Yeah  I mean if you  If you're down  You know what I'm saying  Yeah  Well I don't know  Maybe he won't have to  Maybe he won't put his head down there 
[01:33:00]  Yeah  And that  You said you're living in Brooklyn right  Yeah  Are you living in your car  Yeah that's it  I'm on the side of the Bell Parkway  I thought you were  Funking up with Old Dirty or something  Yeah that's what it is  Hey do you need furniture  We can get a little furniture drive going for you  Nah I think I could  I think I could swing a couple of bean bag chairs  And a cooler  That's all I need  Four recliners and a TV  Oh TV  Whoa  Wow  Boy that'd be nice 
[01:33:30]  I'll be just fine man  Hey Ope with Valentine's Day  What's happening  You going to get Shandy another car  You know keep her off for one more year  Definitely  Yeah  After what I learned today  What are you kidding  What I learned today  Pre-node  Alright guys  Peace man  You rock  That word has just entered my vocabulary 
[01:34:00]  Yeah  Hey is there anything as a post-nup  Pre-nup  Brian  Yes  What's up  Don't do it  I knew it  I knew it  I knew it  I knew it  I got a story for you  You know what's scary  The guy before you  That just completely freaked me out  Was all for me getting the surgery tomorrow  He said no matter what the horror is  It's worth it  That he had to explain to me  And now we have a guy saying don't do it 
[01:34:30]  Go ahead Brian  He  My uncle  He had  You know pretty bad sight  Now this is second hand info  The first guy was first hand info  Okay  But he's a very close uncle  To me  He's a good friend of mine  He goes in for the surgery  He goes Brian for a second  In one eye  Never got the vision back  Okay  Oh shut up  Never  I'm serious  I gotta hang up on him  His little piece of cornea  Like slipped off  Shut up  Shut up  Fell on the floor  That's the dream I've had 
[01:35:00]  Ow  Cause the machine goes across  And actually slices the cornea  And it makes a flap  And then they  And then the flap is like  You know  Fold it over  And then the laser  And then they put the flap back  Put the flap back  And my  The nightmare I've been having lately  Is they just keep going  And cut it right off  Oh  I'm sure it's not how far the machine goes  That does the cut  I'm sure it goes all the way  Past your eye  But like the top or bottom 
[01:35:30]  Is still connected  Well yeah  You know what I mean  It's not like  Oh the machine went too far  And cut the whole slice off  Like a piece of ham  At the deli  Well this is the stuff  I'm going to learn tomorrow  So you don't think  There's a possibility whatsoever  Of it going too far  And just completely slicing it off  Oh dude  There's a possibility  The whole apparatus  Could cave in  And fall into your head  What do I know  Oh  Hey Chris  What's going on  How you doing guys  Alright  I had the surgery done  About three and a half years ago  Yeah  When it was in sort of its infancy 
[01:36:00]  And they went over with the laser  They cut it and everything  They put a  Like the Joseph Mengele Eye Center  He had it done  They put a protective contact over it  So I went to sleep that night  The next morning I go to wake up  I tried to open my eyes  I start screaming in pain  The contact fell out  With all the medication covering the eye  And I had to be dragged to the doctor  With my eyes closed  Walking with two people holding me  Because I couldn't get outside  Because there was no like cornea over it 
[01:36:30]  It was just raw skin up against my eyes  Well that's three years ago  I know  It has changed  But I do have perfect vision  Where are you going to get it done?  I don't want to say right now  I can understand  And Ant  You living in Bensonhurst?  Close enough  Really?  Bay Ridge?  Very close  A good drink if you're in Brooklyn  Cool man  I'll talk to you later  Later  Bye bye  Can't say exactly where Anthony's staying  I'm such a huge celebrity  Oh sure  I'd be swamped  Hey  Oh you are Anthony  Cool 
[01:37:00]  Hey Sal what's up?  What's up?  I got my eyes closed you down a couple months ago  I don't know where the guy went  He must have went to Joe the Butcher or something  Yeah  Nothing  I mean Opie  Don't be afraid  You don't go blind when they flip the thing open  You just see blurry  The guy I don't know where he went  The only time you go blind  Is when they put the thing to open  You know to cut that thing around it  That's it  Right  And they'd numb your eyes so much  With those drops  You could punch yourself in the face  You won't feel a thing  Maybe you should do that when the rock comes in  You won't feel it 
[01:37:30]  That's not a bad idea  So you're very happy with the results?  I'm very happy  I got 15-15 vision  I brought my partner with me  My girlfriend with me  Seven people I brought with me  How bad were your eyes before?  I was on the contact  It was minus 275 and minus 250  Wow  That's pretty bad  My girlfriend was minus 10  And she's 20-20  Yeah  I mean it was really bad  Alright  I mean  I went to Dr. Nick Starley  I don't know if I can say the name  But he's really great  No pain whatsoever  These guys are all trying to scare you  I'm the biggest pussy there is 
[01:38:00]  When it comes to Doc  Right  Let me tell you  But I wasn't afraid at all  Thank you  And I got to see it before I did it  Because I watched my brawler being done  I will not be able to watch anyone else  If I'm going to do it  I just got to just do it  I'm not going to sit there  And watch someone else go through it  No way  It scared me a little bit  Because you got the big TV  All you see is the pupil being done  And that like freaked me out a little bit  But you don't get to see it  When you're underneath the laser  Alright  And I got a big FU to Mother Nature  Because it's damn freezing out here  Alright Sal 
[01:38:30]  Very cold out  Take care  Have a good weekend  Hey if you come to that guy  Hi Anthony  Come over to the house  I'll give you a nice homemade wine  Alright man  Take care  Hey everyone welcoming me  Steve from Brooklyn  Welcoming you back to the neighborhood  Anthony  Says yo welcome to Brooklyn  The fine people of Brooklyn  Welcoming me  I'll be with open arms  Well you'll fit right in  Of course  If I moved to Brooklyn  I don't think I would fit in as well as you  I've always loved Brooklyn  To be with my own kind  I think I have to go all the way out  To Riverhead  Isn't that where the Polish community is 
[01:39:00]  I don't know  A lot of blacks in Riverhead  I'll be  I'm not that Polish  I'm a mutt  Alright a couple more  On the eye surgery  And we'll move on  Mike what's up  What's happening guys  Alright  Had it done last Friday  Last week  Last week  Okay  10 a.m. in the morning  Got home at 1  Laid down till 4  Got up and the first thing I saw  Was the time on my VCR  Crystal clear  And you were just  Wow  Oh look at this  A success story  Unbelievable  And it was no big deal  No big deal  You go dark for about 
[01:39:30]  10 to 15 seconds  And then you see the light  Like you said  That pulse come back on  The whole thing takes 5 minutes  It doesn't take  20 minutes or a half hour  These doctors are doing this  In their sleep now too  Pretty much  Well this guy's in Midtown  You probably heard of him  I won't say who it is  But he knew what he was doing  Cool  So good luck  Hope you go do it  Hope you're a wuss  Alright thank you  See ya  Bye  Don't get  See then  Then I'm like okay  No big deal  I'll go tomorrow  Sounds good  Now I go to Tony  Tony what's up  Don't do it  Opie 
[01:40:00]  I'm telling you the truth man  Listen I had the surgery done about 3 months ago  Yeah  Alright  Here's my problem  My left eye  My left eye  They screwed up something with my tear duct  And what happens is  If you see my eye right now  I got so much water oozing out of my eye  It's constantly  I have to use either like a cloth or something with me  Because they tell me it's normal  Some people  But I got to tell you the truth  It is absolutely the grossest thing  Because it oozes your eye  You can't help it  It's like you're crying all the time in one eye 
[01:40:30]  It's horrible  So I've got a lawsuit pending  Because I  One eye is good  The one eye that I didn't have it done to  You know  Is fine  And maybe go back to the second eye  But now all of a sudden  You know  I've tried to explain to them  What's going on  And the doctor said  Well at first he said  Don't worry about it  It's normal  And now all of a sudden  Don't worry  It's going to heal all by itself  Well that's one of the things I've heard too  Alright Tony  Thank you  Tony  Thank you 
[01:41:00]  I'm infected his hearing too  Obviously  Bob what's up  We've got to wrap up this  Hey Opie  I was thinking of having this surgery done myself  But that first guy that was talking to you  I think talked me out of it  I think he talked half of the tri-state area out of it  And he was the one that was positive  I know  And the thing is  My wife said to me the other day  I think you should go for a vasectomy  And I'm saying  Should I get my eyes fixed  Or go for a vasectomy  But after what that guy said  I think I'm going to go for the vasectomy  I'm not really sure 
[01:41:30]  I hope I go to the right doctor  When I get it done though  Yeah no doubt  Yeah and Anthony  You're full of  Full  You're not living in Brooklyn  You're an old Westbrook with Allison  Alright Bob  Okay  Bye  Yeah we never went by the house  To give her flowers  No  We should have done that  One of the bits that we never did  Seamus what's up  Hey what's up man  Alright  Listen I work in one of the centers  It's no problem  It takes five minutes  You'll never even know it was done 
[01:42:00]  Really  Yeah  You just got to put in drops  Putting in the drops  Are worse than the procedure  Yeah  Sure  Trust me  I've actually seen the flap get cut off  Alright cut it out  That's what I'm worried about  It gets cut off  They put it right back on  And believe it or not  In less than four minutes  It's healed back down  You would never knock it off  How the hell does that happen  How does your eyes like  Whoa  Yeah how does that  Three layers  And they don't go down to the bottom layer  The middle layer is really cohesive 
[01:42:30]  Cohesive Opie  It's like glue  It's its own glue glue  Googley glue  It's called stroma  It heals right down  Alright  Really  How many do you guys do a day  Probably around ten a day  Really  Just go to someone  Who's going to treat you right  Don't go to someone  That says  Oh I do fifty a day  If he does fifty a day  How does he have any time for you  Take your time  Go to someone that's good  Honestly  The guy I picked 
[01:43:00]  I have no problem with  It's just  I'm just  Just scared in general  You know  I did  I've been doing research on this  For a really long time  Since like  Last April  So  We should have gone to one of those butcher shops  And got one of those cow eyes  And a razor  And I could have showed you  Cut it out  Hey that razor they use  Is like a twenty thousand dollar razor  Really  Yeah  Very sharp  Very thin  Oh man  You wouldn't believe this thing  It's so precise  Alright  Thank you Seamus
