<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with the hosts engaging in their signature vulgar banter, filled with graphic sexual comments and boasts about the show's extreme nature.  They begin by describing the horrific state of their studio bathroom, riddled with what appears to be extensive fecal damage, and speculate on a possibly deliberate act of vandalism by a coworker.  The conversation then jumps to a New York Post article about a woman preparing for a potential apocalypse by engaging in numerous sexual encounters, segueing into a discussion comparing the media's disproportionate coverage of the Newtown shooting to the numerous shootings in Chicago.  They touch upon the Westboro Baptist Church's thwarted attempt to protest the Newtown funerals, foiled by counter-protesters, and the subsequent hacking of their Twitter accounts by a teenage hacker known as Cosmo the Great. The political fallout from the Newtown shooting is addressed, highlighting a video showcasing Joe Biden's past pro-gun statements, fueling discussion about perceived hypocrisy. This leads to a broader conversation on racial disparities in media attention given to mass shootings and missing persons cases.  The hosts share personal anecdotes, including one host's near-shitting-his-pants experience and another's lengthy bowel movement. They review the movie "Zero Dark Thirty," discussing its plot, interrogation techniques, and the performances of Jason Clarke and James Gandolfini.  The segment concludes with more off-color jokes and discussions of female comedians.

The show continues with a discussion sparked by a caller's wife obtaining an Academy Awards screener, resulting in an angry exchange between the hosts and the caller over his failure to bring it to the studio.  This transitions into a debate about Billy Crystal, touching upon his upcoming appearances and clips from *SportsCenter*.  A humorous discussion ensues regarding a Twitter comment about the impending end of the world in Australia based on time zone differences, followed by morbid jokes about the disparity in media coverage given to missing white women compared to women of other races.  The shockingly messy bathroom situation is revisited, with a picture tweeted by Opie illustrating the fecal matter splattered across the floor, prompting further humorous and offensive jokes about the culprit.  Frequent caller/guest Rich Voss joins the show, participating in considerable banter which includes discussion of Voss’s appearance, a comped fancy dinner, his new tattoos, and his opinion of Billy Crystal. Several clips of Billy Crystal from *SportsCenter* are played and discussed, alongside a Christmas song, eliciting more commentary on Crystal's career and comedic style.  Highly offensive language and discussion of offensive topics are prevalent throughout this segment.


The next segment features a discussion about Jaden James and Jaden Cole, scheduled guests. An email from E-Rock reveals that Joe Rogan's producer, Brian Red Band, is furious with Jaden James, calling her a "cunt" and accusing her of using Chuck Liddell for publicity and lying about sleeping with celebrities.  The hosts dissect the email, and engage in extensive commentary, with sexually charged discussion and vulgar language, while looking at and commenting on sexually explicit photos of Jaden James.  The conversation shifts to Rich Voss’s upcoming comedy appearances, a news story about a Super Mario impersonator arrested for groping a woman in Times Square, explicit details of a photo series of Jaden James engaging in sexual acts, and a detailed account of the arrest of Ian Watkins, lead singer of the Lost Prophets, for child sex abuse (with the hosts expressing disgust at Watkins’s crimes). A discussion about Rich Voss's recent Twitter controversy over a joke about Olympic gymnast Michaela Maroney follows.  In-studio guest Laszlo recounts discovering his fiancée cheating on him in college, leading him to shave his head and subsequently finding work in radio.  He then describes the devastation caused to his Long Beach, Long Island home by Hurricane Sandy, detailing the flooding, damage, looting, and the subsequent struggles with insurance companies.  The segment concludes with further discussion of the upcoming guest appearance of the Jadens and Laszlo's experiences.


A caller describes their experiences in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, recounting societal breakdown in their neighborhood. The conversation moves to a former employee, Danny, criticized for insensitively delivering bad news.  Anecdotes about hotel room arrangements and a caller's experiences with racism and rumors following the hurricane are shared.  Laszlo, in studio, continues discussing his Hurricane Sandy experiences. Jaden and James Cole, hosts of the "Sex Squad" podcast, join the show in studio, engaging in a lengthy, sexually explicit conversation about their experiences in the porn industry, including detailed discussions of various sexual acts, preferences, and encounters, interspersed with racial comments and personal anecdotes.  A phone call from Brian "Red Band" challenges the Coles' account of their podcast's creation.  The segment concludes with the hosts promoting upcoming shows and appearances. Rich Voss is also present in the studio.


Jaden James and Jaden Cole, two porn stars, are the focus of this segment, centered around a situation involving Jaden James, Chuck (a friend or acquaintance), and photos that appeared online, suggesting a relationship. Jaden James explains that the pictures were from a vacation and that she didn't intend to cause problems; Chuck had called her upset about the photos. The conversation extends into various aspects of the porn industry:  the challenges of making money in the age of free online pornography, the AVN awards, and difficulties working with others in the industry.  Detailed descriptions of pornographic scenes, including explicit descriptions of sexual acts and preferences, are given. Discussions include their relationships, personal lives, and physical attributes, often with explicit or crude language.  Further topics include their past show "Sex Squad," scheduling difficulties, and fallout with former partners. The hosts joke with the guests. The segment ends with the guests plugging their appearances and websites, followed by the hosts continuing their conversation, offering their opinions on the guests and the show, using offensive language.


The final segment features a commercial for Steven Singer jewelry, highlighting the "Super Silver Argentium" collection, free shipping, and the humorous website address: IHATE-STEVEN-SINGER.com.  The hosts discuss their co-workers, Anthony Cumia and Jimmy "The Weasel," focusing on their pursuit of women, especially when porn stars are guests, with explicit details of their competitive attempts to have sex with female guests.  A caller, Sam, corroborates this behavior as common knowledge among listeners.  The segment concludes with mention of the upcoming Ron and Fez show, a statement that the current show may be the last of 2012 or ever, depending on Mayan calendar predictions, and a final sign-off.

[00:00:00]  Oh 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  And this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  So vulgar.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot.  Do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So flatulent.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know what to start. 
[00:04:00]  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow.  Thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  No.  Okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  O&A every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Rules are destroyed and conventions burn to the ground. 
[00:04:30]  Would you like to make some fucking second?  With Opie, the destroyer.  I would eat Petty White's ass.  She's 90, right?  It doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony, the rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fair you wanted.  Pire of these people.  Up my ass all the time trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you.  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:05:00]  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah, absolutely.  Good morning, everyone.  I guess we're starting with Grim in the Morning. 
[00:05:30]  Me and Jimmy.  Where's that music?  Huh?  Where's our Grim in the Morning music?  I don't know.  But I think CNN's using it right now.  Wow, the Post really, they're over those fucking funerals, aren't they?  They sure are.  They're despicable.  I just hope people will understand that the New York Post is not an actual newspaper.  It's a tabloid, right?  A down and dirty tabloid.  They got some broad on the cover basically saying she wants to go out with a bang. 
[00:06:00]  If the world ends tomorrow, she wants to have a lot of sex today.  Is she actually gonna do something, or is she just looking for a headline?  I don't know.  Where is she from?  I don't know.  Is she from Vegas?  Somebody tweeted me a picture of that, so I saw this cover.  Yeah, I haven't read that article yet.  I kind of went, ugh, and just, I actually blew it off.  I actually blew off that story.  Oh, no, she's a New Yorker.  Because it's just horse shit. 
[00:06:30]  But the Post went with it.  Good for them.  She probably wants money.  I mean, maybe not, but I'm hoping she does.  Yeah, what do you got on that, Sam?  And also, we're trying to get to the bottom of, as you look up that info, someone blew  up our bathroom last night.  And we've had issues in the morning where our bathroom, there's like, what, five stalls?  It's four urinals, something like that.  It's a relatively big bathroom.  During the breaks, we all run to the bathroom, and there's just always a ton of people in 
[00:07:00]  there.  And this isn't the first time where we came in in the morning, and the bathroom has been  a complete disaster.  I think there's somebody that's very, very angry around here.  Or we have really bad plumbing.  So it's one of those two things.  You may be right, though, dude.  I looked at it.  I happened to walk in as Travis and Sam are coming in, and it smells atrocious.  It's horrendous.  I, uh, it looks like someone just bent all the way over, grabbed their ankles, and sprayed 
[00:07:30]  shit.  It's everywhere.  And then...  And if it's not bad plumbing, if it's not a clogged toilet...  Whoa, was Lindsay Lohan here today?  Yesterday?  Excuse me.  If it's not bad plumbing, we got a sociopath that works here.  It's not bad plumbing.  Why?  It's why.  Doing some fucking, uh, research?  Doing some detective work.  Yeah?  I'm doing some detective work.  And now, don't say it, but look at...  Now, I have a photo of the floor, but what do you notice about that picture? 
[00:08:00]  Besides the fact that it gets...  I see it.  Our dick's totally hard.  What?  No toilet paper?  No.  See if you notice it.  I can't even look at it.  See if I notice it.  There's toilet...  What am I missing?  Just take a good look at that picture.  Yeah, there's a lot of toilet paper in the toilet.  Yes, and the floor.  And the floor has a lot of shit.  Right.  All right, so...  Where is there no shit?  On the wall?  On the seat!  On the seat! 
[00:08:30]  So what does that mean?  It would have splattered back on the seat.  Oh my god, the seat would be covered with it if it blew up all out of the toilet.  So some idiot either is a psycho, or he had such bad diarrhea he couldn't get his pants  down in time, so the initial spray went everywhere, and then he was able to sit down and take  care of the rest?  But you would...  Yeah, because if I have another shot of it, it goes under the next stall, you know that?  Yeah, I know.  Okay.  Oh no, the whole bathroom was a disaster.  I had to go up into the executive bathroom, which is so much nicer, smells nice. 
[00:09:00]  There's no shit all over the floor.  Although they gave us the better toilet paper downstairs, I noticed.  Upstairs is that really, like, almost waxy toilet paper.  It's a decoy.  They have probably very...  They probably wipe their ass with towels upstairs.  They have a towel dispenser.  They leave the shitty paper, so they're like, well, the people downstairs will think they  have it good.  It's to keep us out.  Oh, keep us out?  You know what?  You're probably right.  I wouldn't be surprised.  But that's...  Maybe that could be...  But this isn't the first time our bathroom has been blown up.  Something goes on around here after we all leave. 
[00:09:30]  I want to know when it happened.  And it doesn't look like it's been there for hours.  No, it's an overnight guy.  It's an overnight guy.  I mean, we're morning guys.  So if it happened in the last couple hours, that's four in the morning.  That's, you know, overnight shit.  And if it was an accidental one, why wouldn't you flush the toilet?  Or, like, you don't see any, like, napkins put down to, like...  Even though I wouldn't clean it up myself either.  But you don't even see him throwing some napkins down, like...  There's no effort.  No effort.  And the toilet is full.  That's a purposeful thing.  Well, when I lost my BlackBerry, they did some detective work with the security cameras. 
[00:10:00]  Yes.  And they decided that it was one of three people that actually took my BlackBerry that I left in the bathroom.  And then that person gave it up willingly and basically said it was a mistake.  I saw it in the bathroom and I just, you know, took it out of there and...  Do they still work here?  I don't know.  They never gave me the name of the person that actually took my BlackBerry and got caught.  Because I completely believe that's what happened. 
[00:10:30]  Why would you work for a company and take somebody else's company, BlackBerry?  I don't know.  It was right when we were doing the switchover from where we used to broadcast.  And I came over here and we were, you know, kind of meeting the people and stuff.  And it was a crazy day and I went to the bathroom and I kind of just left it on the urinal, I think.  Or the sink.  I think I left it on the sink and then went to the urinal, yeah.  And someone just grabbed it.  You only left it for like two minutes, right?  Yeah, yeah.  And it was gone.  And we have a reception desk right outside the bathroom. 
[00:11:00]  So you would assume if someone found a phone in the bathroom, at the very least they would have gave it to that lady.  Yeah.  That seems like the prime area to give something that might be somebody else's.  But they went through those security cameras.  They saw three guys walk in.  They're like, all right, it's got to be.  Well, they saw me walk in.  This is how creepy it is.  They saw me walk in and out.  So like, okay, that's when you walked out without your cell phone.  And all right, all right, here's the other.  Here's three people that walked in.  Oh, and here comes the opster coming back into the bathroom to see if he can find his phone.  So they knew it was one of those three guys, and they went to all three, and one of them gave it up. 
[00:11:30]  That's why the only way to figure this out is to figure out a tighter time frame on the shitting.  Yeah, that's the only reason I'm bringing it up.  So they could go through the security footage, I think.  Overnight, you should see the overnight.  Because first of all, no one's doing that when there's a whole lot of people around.  You can't, because it went under the two stalls.  Right, right.  So unless somebody reported it to maintenance.  Like if you had an accident, you said, look, man, there's a mess in there. 
[00:12:00]  You should take care of it.  It's just disgusting.  It's disgusting, and it's an antisocial, sick fuck who does.  He puts duty on the floor for all of us to see.  We had a guy in our fraternity house.  I don't want to give his name away, Jerry.  Jerry, and he did do that once, and he's not, you know, crazy.  Well, you joked, all right?  No, he was so wasted.  Oh.  He came home completely wasted, and, you know, it was shitty. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, and it just wrote, oh, shit, I'll be there in three minutes.  Oh, a lot of H's.  Oh, shit, be there in three minutes.  So, but good old Jerry got really wasted on some good tap beer from the in-between at Geneseo.  He came home and somehow sprayed the only good couch we had in the TV room with shit.  He sprayed the couch?  Yep.  Kind of like that bathroom.  Except it wasn't a bathroom. 
[00:13:00]  How do you mean, how do you not mean to do that?  I don't understand.  I don't know.  Because somehow your pants have to come down.  Yeah.  And it was like a, it was like a shithose.  It went everywhere.  The wall, all over the fucking couch, the floor.  Did you guys mad at Jerry or did you laugh at all?  Oh, we, we, I'm going to use the word.  I'm sorry, but I have to.  We howled.  That shit is just funny.  Yeah.  As long as you know the guy didn't do it on purpose.  Somebody's so drunk they shit on the sofa is really a hit anytime. 
[00:13:30]  And look, I've been out of college, what, about 10 years now?  12 years?  Almost, yeah.  Yeah, 12 years.  And I still talk about the time Jerry sprayed our TV room with shit.  And all their graduates.  What?  Nothing.  What are you talking about?  10, 12, whatever.  I was getting a ride home from my friend the other day and I, I had, I had to shit.  So it was after, uh, the, our gym because I have my vegetable juice.  Right.  And man, don't go out looking at shades after vegetable juice because, uh, I felt it. 
[00:14:00]  He's driving me up Sixth Avenue and, and I'm two blocks from our house.  I'm by the supermarket.  Right.  And I could feel it pushing.  I was like, I was going to shit my pants in his car.  And, uh, so I made him stop on the corner and I just walked the last block.  I was like, I had to walk in case I shit my pants.  I had to be out of his car.  Right.  Yeah.  I'm fucking 44.  That almost happened to me.  What's wrong with you?  Vegetable juice doesn't do that to me.  Oh my God.  People that drink coffee, they get the, the, you know, the liquid shits.  Two, yeah.  Vegetable drinks, liquid shits. 
[00:14:30]  Not me.  No, no.  It's not necessarily always liquid.  It's, it's, it's, I had two coffees.  And it goes right through you.  The vegetable juice pushes everything.  It's solid.  And then it's a pile of lava on top of it.  It's a fucking pile.  It's fucking horrendous.  How great is it though?  When you just let it all go.  When you stand up and you're empty.  You feel just lighter.  Yeah.  You want to just show people.  I know.  Look what I did.  Big boy.  I actually had a three footer today.  If we're going to continue talking about shit.  These are really nice.  It was just a spiral of one long spiral. 
[00:15:00]  You feel healthy when you shit like that.  Do you?  Yes.  Nick DiPaolo told me the shits.  I just feel impressed.  Nick, Nick told me his shits were a mess.  So I would take gigantic long shits like that and just text him photos.  He would be grossed out by them.  But I would also be kind of prideful.  Yeah.  Like look at my body.  Look at how good my body does.  Look.  I squeeze out all the goodness.  Whenever I take big shits, I feel like it doesn't matter what I ate.  The calories don't count.  Because everything just got shitted out.  Yeah.  But you do it every day.  You do that fucking giant shit. 
[00:15:30]  Why?  10 to 11.  Ah, Sammy.  Ah, Sammy boy.  I knew that was coming.  I know you did.  But yeah, you do feel a little bit healthier when your body is doing that.  It feels like the pipes are clean.  It feels like the pipes are clean.  Well, the bathroom's not clean.  No.  So we got to figure that out.  It's disgusting.  How could you even live with yourself after doing it?  Like how could you leave that place and like feel satisfied without being a psychotic?  Well, I don't know.  Yeah, I just want to make sure it's not some fucking very angry person that's taking it out in that way. 
[00:16:00]  I guess it's better doing it that way than, you know.  Yeah.  The other way.  What time do people clear out of here, you think, at night?  Like what time does it really become a ghost town?  11, 12, tops.  Yeah, I would say.  12 to 5 has got to be a dead zone.  Yeah, around 10 or 11 is when that shift ends.  And then it is a dead zone.  Yeah, they go back to their office, get a few things together, and get the hell out of Dodge.  As they like to say.  What if it was Sal right before everybody else got here?  It wouldn't surprise me.  It would actually make me like Sal more. 
[00:16:30]  Just pissed at everybody.  Yeah.  I imagine Sal has very tiny doodies.  Yeah, like little rabbits.  They're probably perfectly OCD like his hairdo.  Little teeny doodos.  Yeah.  Plink, plink.  A lot of just raisinettes in the toilet.  Yeah, a lot of I don't drink enough fluid shit.  Spittling into the toilet.  Oh, Sal.  So what do we know about this broad that wants to have sex because the world's ending?  It's not even a story.  It's just, I don't know how they got in touch with her, but she was saying she was going  to a party last night.  Right. 
[00:17:00]  And she wants to hook up with somebody just in case the world ends.  Right.  But that's it.  And that's the front page?  That's the front page.  You know what we had to do to get on the front page of the fucking paper and that's all she  had to do?  I think Rupert is responding to my text.  My tweet.  Really?  I sent a couple of, I actually do like Rupert Murdoch for some reason, so I sent a couple  of nice tweets to him.  I didn't motherfuck him.  Right.  And I think old Rupert got on the stick and said, hey.  What'd you send him?  I sent a couple of tweets yesterday.  Yeah.  Saying you guys know what you're doing. 
[00:17:30]  You took yesterday off.  No, you weren't even here fucking around.  What a great show we had.  We're not going to, we're not going to miss you.  Yeah, we're not going to catch you up.  I missed you.  I'll tell you what I didn't miss about Sam, although I do miss his presence.  I didn't miss the way his left arm rests on the edge of the chair and he can fucking  reach over and type without pulling his arm off the chair because he has long praying  mantis forearms.  I hate your long forearms.  There's nothing wrong with my forearms.  No, they're nice, but I have short forearms.  Oh, so it's a jealousy thing.  So it wasn't a hateful tweet, no. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, I took a break from Twitter yesterday.  I did too, kind of.  Yeah, it gets exhausting after a while, so sorry.  I read a bunch of people's tweets to me, but in general, I just took a break.  Sometimes you have to.  Oh, the coverage has been just completely annoying.  I just felt like I needed to step away from the whole thing.  You never want to feel like you're forcing it.  Like, when I feel like I have to, like, really, they're like, nope, you know what?  I had a couple that I thought, um, nope, erase.  Yeah.  It's not organic.  Trying to get a little better with that myself, but yeah, I just want to step away from that 
[00:18:30]  coverage.  The coverage is just brutal.  And they're sort of moving away from it as well.  I think the town has finally had it.  New town has had it.  They want the media out of there.  I'll tell you one good thing, one good story I saw yesterday was the fucking, those scumbags  at the Westboro Baptist Church did not get their protest off.  Oh, you see the line of, uh...  Fucking bikers.  Bikers, cops, firemen.  They made it like a human wall, basically.  Anonymous, uh, tweeted a picture about it yesterday. 
[00:19:00]  And what were they not...  The picture pretty much went viral.  They weren't going to let them set up camp anywhere, right?  Um, they just had a, like, a wall of people.  So, like, the, the cars and the, and the people could get through.  You don't have the actual picture that went viral yesterday?  I tweeted it last night.  You did?  One of them.  Yeah, they said they were Hells Angels, but I don't know if they were Hells Angels or just  if that was the term they were using because they were bikers.  It was, it was a little of everybody.  It was a lot of firemen, actually, that lined up. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, they said it was, uh, it was...  There it is.  Off-duty cops, off-duty firemen.  And then just citizens said, fuck you, we're going to, we're going to make a human wall  so these, uh, people could get, you know, to and fro the, the funeral homes and wherever  else they had to be yesterday.  So good for them, man.  People stepping up like that.  And, uh, yeah, so they did not protest.  Which was nice.  That was the best news I heard in a while.  And it was nice to see Anonymous fucking...  Because they, they go after people, uh, that they're angry at. 
[00:20:00]  And they, they, this guy Cosmo, his name is Cosmo the Great.  Are you following that?  He's got his...  Kramer?  No, no.  He has, uh, he hijacked Shirley, uh, Phelps Roper's Twitter.  Right.  And now he has Fred Phelps Jr.  They got it back eventually from Twitter.  Womp, womp, womp, womp, womp.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, he took, he took Helen's Twitter.  But, uh, yeah, this, this kid, he's like 15, I think.  And, uh, he's a hacker named Cosmo the Great.  And he fucking, I love this dude.  He fucking hijacks their Twitter.  Does he, does he, uh, write good tweets after he hijacks? 
[00:20:30]  He's, no, he doesn't, like, tweet hateful shit either, like, about them even.  He just retweets, uh, bless the victims and all this nice stuff about the victims and the petition to have the Westboro Baptist Church declared a hate group.  Right.  You know, it'd be great if he had, like, creativity behind his, uh, hacking where he could actually, like, be, uh, funny.  He, but, you know what, I don't know if he.  I don't think hacking comes with, like, the ability to really be funny.  Yeah, that's what I said.  Yeah, yeah.  It's one thing to be able to hack, but then you gotta, you gotta have a writer. 
[00:21:00]  But I don't, I don't.  He's hilarious.  As your right-hand man.  All right, now, here, here, I hacked this and now it's yours.  But I don't know, there's almost a method to it.  Like, there's something about, he's doing it for, like, he's not even, I don't even think he's retweeting hateful shit about, like, uh, stuff that I would probably retweet.  I don't even think he's retweeting.  He's almost got, like, a certain type of tone he's taking with the, uh, the Twitter, if I'm making sense.  I can't find it.  Can you find it?  It's, like, Fred Phelps Jr. or something.  But, uh, they said, they said how he did it. 
[00:21:30]  Which is, when you are hacked, you have to send, there's a process your account goes through.  Right.  Like, it's almost like the electronic paperwork that goes through.  Right.  But he knows how to get around that.  To have the paperwork, like, thrown in the garbage before it goes.  So, like, you're trying to get your fucking account back and it's like, it's going in the garbage.  Oh, that's hilarious.  No paperwork has been sent.  No paperwork had been sent.  They're called the Patriot Guard writers.  Oh, the, right.  Okay.  So, they weren't really Hell's Angels. 
[00:22:00]  They were, okay.  Yeah.  Unless there are some Hell's Angels.  Yeah.  So.  Yeah, pray for Newton.  Rest in peace.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  He's just Twittering the names.  Just nice things.  He's not Twittering horrible things.  Sure.  Very good.  He's handling it better than I would.  Yeah.  At 44.  I'm Shirley and I like penises.  That's all I'd be writing.  I like dicks in my butt.  This kid's 15.  He's got a better grasp on it than I would.  He's like, I don't think this is her.  But yeah, you just think, but he knows how much that would, it's almost like that's  a guy who doesn't allow his anger to influence his work. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Like, he's just, rest in peace, the names of the victims.  And that would annoy them.  Oh, more than, yeah.  More than what I would write, which is like, the devil's got his dick in your butt.  I didn't write that.  I think your way is better.  What the hell?  Have fun with it if you hack someone's account.  I know, but I'm just like a fucking third man.  Whatever.  You see, Obama there is signing Mr. Biden.  Yeah, yeah.  To take over the whole gun issue. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, all right.  And then people quickly found videos of Joe Biden loving guns.  Yeah.  Isn't it more of a...  Showing the hypocrisy in Washington.  It's like a bigger issue.  I think it's like the whole thing of mental health and guns.  And it's like a whole talking points on everything to do with the shooting.  Oh, he's doing it all.  Not just the guns.  Yeah.  But they made a sound yesterday.  It was more about the guns.  Well, that's pretty much the number one issue. 
[00:23:30]  See, look, Biden to lead effort against gun violence.  Oh, gun violence.  I see how they do it.  Yeah, yeah.  But go to my Twitter there, Sam.  Well, when they heard...  This video's worth playing real fast.  When they heard that Biden was in charge of it, the NRA cheered.  Exactly.  And a doof.  He's a doofus.  Yeah.  Listen to this.  This was only four years ago.  Computer's all fucked up.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  And the replay was fucked up yesterday.  Was it really? 
[00:24:00]  Yep.  That's what happens when I'm not here.  How about the Jim Norton show?  Was that fucked up?  That was really fucked up.  Oh, my God.  Oh, good God.  Tragedy.  I mean, the sound quality was crystal clear, but it was really fucked up.  The content was really fucked up.  It really was just 44 minutes of Drekola.  But Biden, this was four years ago.  I'm assuming just before him and Obama got together as a little...  Oh, a little duet.  Their last get-together. 
[00:24:30]  Listen to this.  I guarantee you, Barack Obama ain't taking my shotguns, so don't buy that malarkey.  Don't buy that malarkey.  They're going to start peddling that to you.  I got two.  If he tries to fool my Beretta, he's got a problem.  Wait.  All right.  But was that...  Are those not assault weapons?  No.  Shotgun.  So he's basically saying that Obama's my guy, but he's not going to take my shotgun.  He's not going to take my shotgun.  Yeah, but it's the attitude.  Yeah.  And it's the attitude of like, look, you're not taking my fucking guns. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  And you can't see it on the radio, but he's got a Klan hood on.  I think there's a longer version of the video that pops up after that.  Shotguns are impervious to gun control, guys.  Yeah, but that's, you know, I mean, but who wants to drive to impervious to get them?  Jesus.  Oh, geez.  Oh, geez.  No, you don't see the longer version?  That's fine.  Shotguns are never on the forefront of like, oh, we got to get shotguns away. 
[00:25:30]  What does impervious mean?  Yeah, they're not exposed to.  Yeah, they're not, it's not on the burner to be taken away.  My perint was that...  Perint.  He's got that attitude, you're not taking my guns.  Yeah.  Whether they're legal or, you know, illegal.  Obviously, the one he was talking about there isn't a legal gun that they're not trying to take away from people.  Obviously, I don't think Obama had any intention of really getting into the gun control thing if this didn't happen. 
[00:26:00]  Of course not.  But now it's the big issue.  Of course not.  They didn't, him and Romney didn't bring it up during the campaign.  Not at all.  Yeah, because they know that would fuck up the votes.  Yep.  The voters.  It's too hot.  Yeah.  It's too hot.  Hot potato.  Yeah.  Now even the NRA is saying, all right, we'll do something.  So it's...  We'll see.  Yeah, it's a big issue now.  We'll see what that means in the end.  Yeah, I guess tomorrow the NRA is going to have a big address for this whole thing and see what they say. 
[00:26:30]  But they've never said anything in the past about any kind of gun control issues.  So we'll see what happens.  This one bothered everybody.  Everyone.  Everyone.  Everyone.  Everyone.  Everyone.  It's so many things.  And black people always say, like, well, white people don't care as much about black kids getting shot.  But it really is, this is not a black guy thing to do.  Like, black guys very rarely go in and kill all co-workers.  I'm sure there would be other show members who have theories as to why that doesn't happen. 
[00:27:00]  And there's also...  There's a white boy crime.  That's for sure.  It's a white guy crime.  There's a white boy crime.  Yeah, a white man.  Black people don't walk in and shoot.  They just don't go in and kill classrooms full of kids.  It's not a black guy crime.  No, no, it's not a black guy crime.  No.  No.  Somebody was...  Why do that when you can do it from a car?  Exactly.  Why get your new shoes, Jared?  That's a black boy crime.  Someone was spreading something around.  It showed a bunch of...  Shit, it's in the bathroom.  I heard about that. 
[00:27:30]  Spreading some shit around about...  Shit.  About white people that committed crimes and black people that were victims.  And they showed, you know, a bunch of pictures of them.  But the truth of the matter is, 60 people, over 60 now, I'm sure, were shot in Chicago.  Right.  In the time from the school massacre till now.  And, you know, nothing really...  Apparently, people don't deem it as important as when it's one mass killing. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  Well, the fact is, as a nation, you know, you're affected when it's white.  Yeah.  Kids.  Yeah.  When they look like you.  Way more.  Yes.  It means more.  Way more.  I mean, that is a fact.  I know that shit goes down.  It's been that way with kidnappings.  When you see people on the news, it's like, oh, there's a missing little white kid.  Well...  You know, they'll always put more attention toward it.  The great Patrice O'Neill, who's very much still alive, did a great bit on that. 
[00:28:30]  Why doesn't he come in here?  No, he's a Howard guy now.  Bastard.  Maybe we can find that bit going into the break.  But he talks about how, like, you know, black kids get no attention when they go missing on TV.  And he's right.  I thought of him driving in, actually.  There's a bit about Natalie Holloway.  And the timing of...  Exactly!  Like, that big, booming...  What a great moment that is.  That takes a lot of balls and confidence, knowing that the crowd was going to react like that. 
[00:29:00]  Yes.  The whole bit depends on the fact that, you know, no one says anything.  Was that girl from Aruba was killed?  And everyone yelled out, Natalie.  I think, didn't he say five years ago?  Yeah, yeah.  Natalie Holloway, they all yell it out.  And he's like, yeah, yeah, that's right, that's right.  And that guy that did that, he also killed a girl in Peru.  What was her name?  He said recently, like last week.  Yeah, yeah, recently killed her.  And the silence is deafening.  And then he goes, exactly!  No one could mention her name.  Fucking brilliant.  Brilliant! 
[00:29:30]  God damn, was that a good point.  Find out if you're a Ken Sam.  It's so worth playing, man.  It's an indisputable point.  Right.  It really is.  You know, going back to the white kids, in our gym, there's a floor dedicated to kids.  Yes.  You know, when you're trying to get back out on the street, you get in the elevator, it  stops on that floor a lot.  Yesterday, it stops, and it had to be at least six white six-year-olds.  I fucking got depressed immediately. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, just saying them?  Yeah, they're talking about, you know, what they're doing for Christmas.  This one little girl's talking about how she's going to Utah.  They go to Utah every Christmas, and I'm just sitting there like, holy fuck, these are  the exact fucking people that fucking died last week.  Isn't that true?  It's like you see kids that age, and you only think like, oh, God, that, like, it's fucked  up, but you almost picture them like, oh, God, imagine seeing that with, like, bullets in  them.  I don't know.  It's horrible.  Terrible.  It was, it got me really depressed quickly. 
[00:30:30]  And then, you know, I got outside, and I forgot about it.  That's not true.  Then I went to Pinkberry.  Then I went to Starbucks, and I was fine.  I didn't think about it.  We sure are activists for five minutes at a clip, aren't we?  I went to Starbucks yesterday, and there was just this fat fuck behind me ordering one  of those.  Oh, E-Rock, move.  Caramel, swizzle, cinnamon, fucking drinks.  Starbucks has to have numbers. 
[00:31:00]  It's so douchey when you hear someone, I know it's an old bit, and it's probably a hack  bit that a lot of comics do, but it's really, like, so douchey when you hear someone order  their drink at Starbucks.  It's uncomfortable.  It sounds like a cliche, yeah.  I was getting, like, some gift cards, and then as they're ringing me up, they go to  the next guy.  He's just a big, fat fuck, so he probably listens to our show.  Sorry.  And he's ordering, and I actually found myself, I looked him right in the eye and just went 
[00:31:30]  like this, like, ugh.  I gave him that almost, like, Patrice face once again.  I gave him, like, I couldn't help myself.  I'm like, how do you live with yourself ordering that in public?  Was it a fattening drink?  Yeah, but you had to name all the ingredients.  It's caramel, cinnamon, fucking chocolate swirl.  I don't know what the fuck this thing was.  Isn't it embarrassing to order that?  But how about just have a number?  I'll take a number, too, because I don't want to sound like a, you know, a douche.  Did you have to say a number two after what we saw this morning? 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, there's number two all over the bathroom.  Should we tweet that?  I'm thinking of it.  You should tweet a picture.  Oh, please.  It's shit splattered everywhere.  That's what was waiting for us today.  Isn't it embarrassing to have to name theme kind of orders?  Like, oh, I'll take the happy, pappy.  No, my pancake.  I never say it.  No, it's terrible, right?  I used to go to IHOP, and I used to love the Rudy Tootie Fresh and Fruity.  Rudy Tootie Fresh and Fruity.  And then I, for a while there, I started just pointing at it. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  But then they would have to go, are you talking about, which one are you talking about?  The Rudy Tootie Fresh and Fruity.  And guess what?  I don't eat that anymore, because I don't want to order it.  Florentine would always just point to it on the menu.  Yeah, I do.  I'm like, give me that one.  And the guy would be like, yeah, I want that one right there.  And he would never say the name.  I'm not going to say the faggot name.  I'm not saying it.  Why would I?  Rudy Tootie Fresh and Fruity.  Who the fuck wants to say Rudy Tootie Fresh and Fruity?  But I remember to this day, haven't had it in probably 10 years. 
[00:33:00]  Forget IHOP.  Change the names, I'll come back.  I never wanted to have a Fribble.  Give me a shake.  Give me a vanilla shake.  The Fribble.  Friendly's Fribbles ruled when I was growing up.  Love the Fribble.  Harborfield High School, walked into Greenlawn to that Friendly's and had a nice Fribble.  Now it's a stupid, I think, now it's a dumb drugstore.  Everything's turning into a drugstore.  You know what it's like for John Glenn people to have to go into Harborfield's turf and do that?  You had to drive in.  I always thought you were going to get your ass kicked getting pizza at fucking the pizza place down by Harman Drugs. 
[00:33:30]  Harborfield's had some tough guys.  Not.  Not.  I don't think anyone was scared of the Harborfield's crew.  Along with John Glenn and their two black people.  Stupid Cornelius.  The black kid that I thought would protect us all.  And then it turns out he was just as scared as black people as we were.  Oh my God.  Like Cornelius, you walk around like you're from the hood.  How about you fucking show us the way? 
[00:34:00]  I was born in Greenlawn.  Leave me alone.  He would hide.  Like really?  He would have the comb and the hair and everything.  He was so ghetto.  But then when it came down to it, I've told a story.  We played basketball and had to go into the real black towns.  And he was scared.  He was more scared than we were.  He was also embarrassed.  You think he was embarrassed?  Oh my God.  Yes.  Because then we realized what he really was about?  No, he was embarrassed not about you guys.  By the other black people seeing him.  All these white guys.  Oh my God. 
[00:34:30]  You think that's what it was about?  Please.  He's on the opposing team twice.  Yes.  When he was going to another school.  Twice.  We were going to these schools thinking we were really good.  And these guys were all dunking, you know, before the game.  We did the layup drill or whatever.  And we're just sitting there just shaking.  Did you know your goose was cooked?  Oh, fuck yeah.  The stands are filled with a ton of black people.  And, you know, I'm talking about 16, 17.  When you don't understand any of that shit yet.  You just knew it was scary.  I remember the black school. 
[00:35:00]  And then Cornelius is sitting on the bench.  And I'm like, will you fucking give us some pointers here?  And he's just sitting there shaking.  I remember the black schools having like adult woman cheerleaders.  Like Central Islip.  They seem like they had these fucking women.  Their cheerleaders were women.  Well, their sons were on the team.  Like big tits and asses.  And they're cheering.  It's like, God, they're women.  I think they just developed a little sooner than most.  Yeah, a tad. 
[00:35:30]  Maybe had an extra year or two in there.  Maybe.  I don't know.  But we'd have armed guards walk us in and out of these high schools.  Oh, my God.  We got our ass kicked.  But then we did great with the other white high schools because we weren't scared.  Cornelius was embarrassed as well.  He was probably scared as part of it.  He was right.  You're right.  He was probably nervous.  But there's also that weird thing where picture yourself as a guy walking into a room of just regular dudes and everyone on your team is gay except for you. 
[00:36:00]  Like you'd look at those other guys and be like, I mean, besides the luck you'd have.  Oh, okay.  But you'd be like, you'd feel like, fuck, man.  They're thinking that it's a whole thing you're worried about.  Even though they're the opposing team, there's a guy thing beyond your teammates.  But he would walk around Harborfields like he was Walt Frazier.  Of course.  Yeah.  Like he was completely immersed in the black culture and, you know, spent weekends in fucking Harlem.  Think how they felt when the mathletes came to town, though.  Oh, we're getting our ass kicked. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, dude.  I don't drink the bikini teenies.  That was one time.  They're delicious.  I do like a nice fruity fucking drink with some vodka.  Of course.  Absolutely.  Yes.  Absolutely.  You know, if there's cranberry and orange juice around, that vodka is wonderful.  Yes.  I like a colorful drink.  That is true.  Mm-hmm.  Fuck it.  Yum.  What happened?  No, just look at this L.I.E. crash.  Jesus.  It looks like a movie scene.  Fucking, it looks like a movie scene.  Forty cars. 
[00:37:00]  Way out there near.  Forty car pileup.  It looks like it was near Waiting River area.  Oh, way out there.  68.  I've never been out that far in a while.  I think that's about my exit when I used to go see my Grammys and our beach house.  68 is out there, yeah.  How far is that close?  Is that close to the Hamptons?  Got a lot of local references today.  No.  No, not really.  Not even close, no.  It's not even, it's before Riverhead.  And then at Riverhead, then you got the two forks like kind of going like that.  I just don't know anything about Lyle.  That's out by, uh.  That's out there, though.  It's pretty far out.  Yeah.  I, um.  What happened? 
[00:37:30]  18-wheeler lost control.  With flammable mulch.  He had flammable mulch.  And he hit a woman or something.  Flammable mulch?  Yeah.  And only one person died, I say only, because you gotta see these pictures, it's 40 fucking  cars all over the place.  There should be 20 of that people, yeah.  It's unbelievable.  Manure!  I hate manure!  I guarantee we have one listener that was involved in that.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Odds are, yeah.  Absolutely.  So.  It's a bit like Shirley.  Yeah, yeah.  Shirley out there.  Shirley, all that shit.  Yeah. 
[00:38:00]  So.  Yikes.  Last night.  Oh, Jimmy.  If you wanna go see Zero Dark Thirty.  Oh, you saw it!  Make sure you go.  What's Zero Dark Thirty?  I don't even know.  Oh, it's the new movie out about.  Hurt Locker woman directed it, right?  Yes, Catherine Bigelow directed it.  And it's about the, uh, it's mostly about the woman in the CIA.  Yeah.  Who was tracking Bin Laden.  And it does go up and cover the raid that got him. 
[00:38:30]  And, um.  Don't mention of Obama, though, or, um, like, Clinton.  Very.  Hillary.  Yeah, very.  You feel almost zero political push right away.  Okay.  It is simply about this trek to get him.  And, uh, it was a 715 movie.  So I say to my friend Annie Letterman.  You know Annie.  Yes!  We worked together on the road.  Yeah.  And, uh, she bought tickets.  So I'm like, she wanted to go.  I'm like, yes.  So she's like, I'll meet at 7, of course.  She gets there at 715, so we get into the movie at 730. 
[00:39:00]  And it's good.  Chicks.  When you go, no, but when you go to see the movie, the way you want to go, because you  really want to go into the theater when it's packed.  Oh, no.  Because it's, I hate when I got to sit, like, in the middle of the fucking theater.  Like, I was like, you know what?  As long as row one is open.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  I've never sat in the first row.  Literally, you're looking up.  Yes.  I feel like a piece of duty in more than one way.  But why can't they have the first row 10 feet further back? 
[00:39:30]  Get rid of those seats.  No one enjoys them.  And half the time, you've got to get people's money back, because they're not going to sit  there like that.  Dollars.  But the chairs go back a little bit.  And after a while, you really do forget.  And Kathleen Bigelow uses that, I think it's Kathleen or it's Catherine.  Catherine.  I'm sorry.  Catherine uses that, like, camera movement a little bit.  Shaky movement.  Yes.  But with her shit, it works.  And, uh...  Did you throw up?  No.  But that movie was fucking great.  Wow.  Okay.  I thought you were going the other one. 
[00:40:00]  I know.  Holy shit was that good.  You never know what Jimmy's going to say.  It was so...  Because I read the SEAL's book, and, um, you know, too much ball bouncing on the nose.  I didn't...  I lost interest after page one.  Water.  But it was, uh...  Covered his eyes with his flipper all cute.  They covered the SEALs, of course, but, uh, it is about...  And one of the SEALs...  It's not some politically correct...  Like, they...  One of the SEALs said, I credit this woman, uh, who was an attractive woman who worked in 
[00:40:30]  the CIA for relentlessly tracking Osama bin Laden.  Or, as they called him in the agency, UBL.  UBL.  And they, uh...  They track from 2002.  Wow.  And they show you these methods of interrogation that these guys would use.  It's fucking...  Waterboarding?  Yes.  Uh, but they don't soften it up.  And they don't...  You don't feel like they're giving you a message.  I love that I didn't feel like she was forcing...  Some political message. 
[00:41:00]  Because I was going...  As they're fucking...  As they're getting information, I'm like, yes, I was fucking...  Yeah.  Like, John McCain, I think, didn't like it because he thought it glorified torture.  Well, look.  Okay.  She's been through...  Oh, well, that's some shit.  You know what?  McCain gets a pass.  I gotta take that one back.  Yeah, he does get a pass.  I just said tough shit to them.  Yeah.  I'm an idiot.  He has five years.  Wasn't thinking on that one.  Of course.  He'll Hanoi Hilton.  Hilton.  As they say, yes.  So he knows from a...  Love him or hate him, he's an American hero.  Yes.  Sorry.  Yeah, go ahead, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  That's okay.  From a soldier's point of view, he understands that. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  And these guys, you know, whatever they are, they're soldiers on some level.  So they didn't present it like, oh, look how horrible we are doing this.  Or...  No.  Look how great this is that we're doing this.  No.  So here's what it was.  They show you these methods getting information.  Yeah.  There's one line, and it's just a fucking...  It's one of the guys...  It's a...  He's just a regular...  He's not a typical bad guy, like, you know, white bad guy.  He's just a CIA guy who interrogates these motherfuckers. 
[00:42:00]  And I forget the actor's name, but he's got a beard.  And he doesn't look like you'd picture a military interrogator.  Right.  He's not the typical picture you have.  He looks like a mercenary.  And he's talking to one of these guys.  And maybe it was just a movie line, but I loved it.  And he goes something like, you're going to break.  Everybody breaks, bro.  It's biology.  And I'm just like, oh, my God.  They get everybody to break.  They get everybody.  Everybody breaks.  You're all brave and stuff.  I appreciate that.  But just give it up now. 
[00:42:30]  It's biology.  It's biology.  But when they waterboard these guys...  He's Australian.  Get the fuck out of here!  I saw it.  I had no idea.  Stop it, Sam Roberts.  You saw the movie too, Sam Roberts?  Oh, I didn't know you saw it.  Let it Sam Roberts see it.  When were you going to bring it up?  To the show?  Yeah, thanks.  What the fuck?  After show?  Exclusive to the after show?  He probably went yesterday morning instead of being here at the radio.  He's like, I want to go to the movies.  Why are you keeping everything to yourself?  I saw it on Friday.  Last Friday.  Oh.  All right.  We should have talked about it Friday.  Would you have to take Jess to something she wanted to see as opposed to that wrestling 
[00:43:00]  shit?  We watched a screener in the house.  What?  How are you getting screeners?  Sorry.  How the fuck is this guy getting screeners?  I didn't get a screener.  I've had it.  I can't go to movies anymore.  I got two kids.  Give me your fucking screener.  And you're famous.  He's famous.  Why do you get screeners?  Really famous.  That's true too.  I'm married to somebody who works in the industry.  How about you give me the screener?  Hmm?  How about you be a friend?  What the fuck?  What are you doing to screeners?  What are you guys just watching?  What is she watching it over and over and you're watching it? 
[00:43:30]  How about you pass it along to your fucking so-called friends?  What a piece of shit.  Yes.  The screener's gone.  What do you mean the screener's gone?  It's been moved along.  To who?  To people in Jessica's workplace.  Holy mackerel.  How about you tell Jessica that from now on.  Not good.  Not good for me.  Nope.  I'm shocked.  You know who's not shocked that Jessica's behaving that way?  Who?  She's Sylvie.  Oh God.  Somehow I could have predicted that one too.  So you like.  Wasn't that guy great?  Jason Clarke?  He was amazing.  Yeah.  He was really good. 
[00:44:00]  God damn was he good.  I want to see his movie now.  It's winning all sorts of Golden Globe nominations.  It should be Best Picture I think.  It was better than Lincoln.  It's nominated for Best Picture and other things.  They did a really good job of showing how much that these terrorists weren't going to say anything and how horrible the tortures were.  That made them talk.  And it's just biology, huh?  Yeah.  That means they have some biologists on the payroll.  But you understand why they're doing it too.  I didn't feel at all angry with them for doing it. 
[00:44:30]  I felt like they're getting information from these guys.  How do they get them to talk?  Do they play Billy Crystal's Christmas song?  Oh Jesus.  What Christmas song?  I didn't hear one.  Oh boy.  Billy Crystal's Christmas song?  I like Billy.  Is it called Barry fucking Christmas?  Oh wait a minute.  That's Dennis.  That's Billy Crystal.  That's right.  That's Dennis Lurie.  You love Billy Crystal, right?  I do, yes.  And someone also saying that we gotta, I don't know, can we get Billy Crystal doing Sports  Center last night?  Sure.  My pal Corey on the Twitter, he says, dude, you gotta see Billy Crystal doing ESPN Sports 
[00:45:00]  Center last night.  Let's talk about some football.  I don't know.  We're gonna have to cut that one up because Sports Center is about a half hour, but.  I got time.  You don't.  We can do the whole half hour.  No, no, no.  That's what he says.  That's what he says to one of the fucking detainees.  I got things to do.  You don't.  He said you have to let them know how helpless they are.  You have to make them realize the gravity of their situation.  So you're fully aware how they torture these guys now, right? 
[00:45:30]  They show up.  There's probably a lot they didn't get into or show that's classifiable.  I know if we're like, oh, fuck.  Does it give you confidence in our government?  You know what it shows you?  How hard it is.  When it comes to get info.  What do you mean how hard it is?  To get, to piece together Al-Qaeda all over the world, in Pakistan, in fucking, in  Karachi, in Afghanistan, in all these places, the way that they have these fucking CIA,  they call them black sites, and the way information was the dead end was going, yes, the dead ends 
[00:46:00]  they hit, and this woman, and it's not a fucking movie.  This is what actually happened, who was locked on Abu, I don't remember his name, but he  was the courier, and she was after this fucking guy, and you love this woman.  That was the final straw, that fucking guy, right?  Yeah.  The courier.  I want to see this movie.  Dude, I couldn't believe how good this movie was.  Maybe I'll get a screener.  Oh, that's right.  I'm not Sam Roberts.  Sorry.  Neither is Sam.  Jessica.  Yeah, it'd be Jess Roberts. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, my God.  She's the big shot.  Oh.  Fuck, was that good?  Way too hot for him, by the way.  Who are we getting?  Are we getting Piccolo in?  I would love to get her in.  I would love to get the lead actress in.  I would love to get that guy in.  That fucking movie was great.  Well, the rest of these guys got to see it before we do that.  Well, yeah, maybe I'll, you know, get it.  I watched it at home on my 32-inch flat screen.  I'd rather sit in the first row and lay on the floor like I was.  Oh, that'll be good.  Yeah.  32-inch.  You're just in the front row.  Dude, it was so good.  Did you get any off of Annie? 
[00:47:00]  No, it wasn't a date.  I don't...  Isn't that a date, though?  Even though it's not a date, it's a date.  No.  You went out with a girl somewhere, it's a date.  But it's...  Why else would you hang out with a girl?  Right!  They like to think that maybe guys and girls could be friends.  That's stupid.  Oh, just pals!  That's stupid.  Stop it.  Did Amy and I go recently...  We were supposed to go to a...  Oh, no, we were going to go to a movie, but I had a spot.  Nah, it's like with comic friends of mine, we do things like that, and we went out to  eat after, and it's not...  Yeah.  It doesn't feel like that.  No.  I don't think Annie likes me anymore. 
[00:47:30]  Or ever liked you.  I know.  No, why didn't you tell me?  She wanted to go shooting with me.  Yeah.  And I never made the date to go shooting.  Well, you will.  To go shooting.  So just go shooting.  I should.  Yeah, why not?  She's fun.  Yeah, she seems like a very nice girl.  She's funny and fucking mean.  Anytime I see her name, though, and see a picture of her, she talked once about how when  she was growing up, she looked exactly like the singer from Hanson.  And now that's all I think about.  And it's hotter that way.  Yeah.  Well, here's how you know it's not a date, because first of all, we're friends, and second 
[00:48:00]  of all, she goes, you want to go to the movies?  I'm like, yeah, and then she texts me, because I just want to shove popcorn into my boyish  Polish face.  I'm like, that's not sexy talk.  I don't think she realizes how cute she is, though.  I don't know.  Female comics are crazy, man.  Female comics are insane.  But the funny ones are really funny.  Yes, they are.  And they're funny conversationally.  Like, that's how you know, that's how I know I like a female comic, is if they're funny  conversationally.  They're intimidating, though. 
[00:48:30]  They're fucking, female comics are intimidating.  Really?  Yes.  I don't think so.  Yeah, because they joke about everything.  Yeah.  They're intimidating.  I don't know why.  It seems like they have one step up on regular girls.  Oh, because one of the powers men have is making women laugh.  That's one of our qualities.  And when they have that, you're like, oh boy, there's a big one in the arsenal.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, I prefer that.  You almost feel like they're pointing at your penis and laughing.  Well, they are.  It's the best way to explain a female comic, because they're always that person.  Yes.  You try to have a little serious moment with them, and they'll spin it in a way. 
[00:49:00]  Like, oh, look at your stupid penis.  That's exactly how it feels.  Of course it is.  They have that edge on you.  The Obster's been around.  Yeah.  You know who's great in Zero Dark Thirty, by the way?  I forgot he was in it.  Who?  Gandolfini.  Yeah, he was.  Oh, wow.  It's Leon Panetta he plays, right?  How do you know?  Really?  I saw a screener.  I watched it at home last Friday.  Oh, a screener at home.  Great.  Does he play like Tony Soprano again?  Yeah, he goes like this.  He plays Leon Panetta.  And he goes, hey, we got to get out there and fucking whack Bin Laden. 
[00:49:30]  We got to fucking whack him.  Of course.  Plays the same role in every movie.  Where's the gabagool?  I need some gabagool before we whack him.  When you look at him, he curses in it, but it's like...  It's not Tony Soprano.  It's not Tony Soprano.  Of course it's Tony Soprano.  Stop it.  And we got to fucking whack Bin Laden.  How do they make him not look like Tony Soprano?  He's one of those guys, you see him, and I don't care if...  And he is a good actor.  I'm just fucking around.  But every time you see him in a movie, you're like Tony Soprano. 
[00:50:00]  Tony Soprano.  Unfortunately, he's got that look.  He's one of those typecast dudes.  But when you hear him talk nowadays, in other movies, it's like, hi.  Right.  Scandalfini.  He had a little bit of...  He almost had like a southern thing going on.  He fems it up.  He didn't sound Italian in that movie.  No.  Hey, what the fuck?  Even when he curses, he's like...  He looks like Leon Panetta.  I mean, I know who he was.  Yes.  Oh, he does.  And they added a little hair.  Oh, my God.  Look, he's got a little comb-over.  He does not look like Tony Soprano.  Leon Panetta.  His vibe had the CIA, right? 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's pretty good.  It was a very sort of bureaucratic, dickhead boss vibe.  Not a mafia vibe.  Oh, man.  I saw it on the screen or so.  Oh, that's nice.  How'd you get it?  My wife works in the business.  What business?  Why won't you at least tell us?  Oh, show.  Yeah, you hunk of shit.  Or have a showing on your 32-inch giant TV.  Exactly.  Thank you.  Fuck it.  On that postage stamp box of shit you watch TV on.  By the way, could it have been brought in and burned here for us?  I mean...  Travis is nodding yes. 
[00:51:00]  Technologically, yeah.  Why didn't you?  How the fuck are you doing that?  Holy fuckaroni.  You're selfish.  What a prick.  Sammy, we would have talked about it on the show.  You suck.  Sorry.  I didn't say anything.  I mean...  A one-way motherfucker.  That's right.  Except for his asshole.  You're implying that a cock goes in there.  Yeah, actually, there's only one way, because he shits out of his mouth, and his hiney is  one way.  Dick's in only.  We got all kinds of Academy screeners.  Oh, right.  It's the season.  Academy screeners? 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  I mean, that's what they're for, for your consideration.  What is she, a director?  Don't you worry about it.  I guess I won't.  Let's break.  The food is warm.  We got lots to do.  This guy just wrote, uh, Brett, Brett Trick Jay, I guess.  I'm trying to help you guys out.  Check out the big brain on Brett.  He writes, uh, SportsCenter was a full hour, hour with Billy Crystal.  I couldn't turn it off.  Smart motherfucker.  Got a couple clips.  Huh?  Got a couple clips.  I want to hear that.  Yeah, we'll play it after the break. 
[00:52:00]  Also, it's Christmas song after the break.  Unfortunately, Jimmy's got to do something for the next hour, but he'll be back at eight  o'clock.  Oh.  Yeah.  I'm pretacing some stuff.  It's so strange that you have to go.  Here comes the pre.  You have to go right, right before we talk about Billy Crystal.  Every time that happens.  It's really strange.  It's really strange.  I genuinely like Billy.  He's been very nice to me.  You do not.  Let's be honest here.  I do.  You've sat there and made stinky faces when we talk about him.  I made stinky faces when we talk about everything but Ozzy.  Oh, that's true.  No, I actually do like Billy. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, okay.  Also, I will not bash my friend.  Of course not.  Also, Patrice's girl there, Von DiCarlo on Twitter.  Fucking good bit right here by Von.  She wrote this a little while ago, so I think it's down to an hour, so I'm going to adjust  her tweet.  She writes, just under one hour left before the end of the world in Australia.  Oh, man.  So we don't have to wait for tomorrow.  Oh, that's right.  If the world's going to end, it's going to start ending in Australia. 
[00:53:00]  It's kind of like the fucking New Year's Eve thing.  Yeah.  How do they know?  Time zones.  So we're an hour away from finding out if the end of the world is happening.  So the world's not going to collapse.  It's going to go by time zone by time zone.  Well, how else does it work?  Yeah.  By the Mayan calendar.  Oh.  I assumed everybody was on New York time.  My and your own business is all so fucking cool.  What am I going to do with you?  Nothing, cocksucker.  Hope you die tomorrow.  Holy shit.  What the fuck, man?  Hey. 
[00:53:30]  Please stay healthy this weekend.  That'll be really creepy to replay on Monday.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Chip Stradamus.  Jesus.  Chip Stradamus.  The fucking World War III is going to be on the way of something.  Oh, no.  Get a lot of rest.  Drink water this weekend.  Exactly.  Do a little meditating.  Keep everything chill.  Masturbating.  Yeah.  Just so Jimmy doesn't have that on his conscience for the next fucking.  The Earth will circle the sun.  The moon will be in line with Uranus.  That's hilarious, Chip. 
[00:54:00]  Fuck, yeah.  Chip Stradamus, cocksucker.  Chip Stradamus.  It's terrible.  End of the world in Australia in an hour.  We're going to find out today.  Thank you, Von DiCarlo.  Speaking of Von, you want to play that Patrice bit going to break?  That we just referenced?  Yes.  Sure.  And there's also, what does he have?  What's the new bit of Patrice?  There's like a 20 minutes.  It didn't make his CD or something.  It's on iTunes.  iTunes.  There's Patrice material all over the place that we would love for you guys to purchase  if you're a fan.  Yeah, go to iTunes.  It helps the family. 
[00:54:30]  What's in this baby blue backpack?  He's a fucking creep.  What's wrong with him?  He's a creep.  He's just a creep.  Well, at least it's not that fucking dumb woman's bag.  The Louis Vuitton thing he sashays in with?  The Louis Vuitton is Louis.  That looks like his daughter's school bag.  Yeah.  With his grandfather's hat.  Voss is a terrible Jew.  Oh, he's a newsie.  X-tree, X-tree, read all about it.  Exactly.  Except he wouldn't know how to, he wouldn't know what that meant when he said it. 
[00:55:00]  He was actually probably always going, no, no, no, it's not X-tree, it's not read all  about it.  Read all about it.  Read all about IT.  They're like, get the new kid over here.  All right, we got the Patrice bit we referenced going into break, so I'll hit that.  I'm thinking one in particular, bad titties in the front row.  Thank you so much.  Thank you, audience coordinator, for putting those titties up in the front row.  God bless you. 
[00:55:30]  That was distracting me.  I was supposed to come out, oh, it was, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, yeah.  Oh, y'all here?  Yeah, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  You look lovely, though, by the way.  Yes, you do.  Yes, you do.  Congratulations, my friend.  I'm glad y'all here.  It's very good.  Yo, congratulations to you, my friend.  Look at that white woman you're with.  God damn.  God damn. 
[00:56:00]  There's a nigga behind you going, yeah, son, I'm with my girl, but yo, for real?  That white woman's amazing, isn't she?  Tell the truth.  He's with his black girlfriend like, no, I don't know, but that, she's high level.  That's a high level white woman right there.  That white woman is, that is, man, oh, man, oh, man. 
[00:56:30]  Black women get mad at that, but that is top shelf white woman right there.  You know how you can tell how pretty a white woman is?  The value, you look at her, and then you wonder how long they would look for if she was missing.  Come on, take a look, take a look. 
[00:57:00]  Look at this nigga, look, look, look, look, look.  I saw you look mad, sweetie.  How long if you was missing?  How long you think they were?  How long you think they were?  Exactly.  She don't even, she went.  She went.  You know the deal.  I ain't said nothing wrong.  White woman's life is valuable. 
[00:57:30]  What's his name?  Joran Vandersloot?  Right?  We find out he was a serial killer.  Man, he kills women.  That's what he do.  He do it well.  You know what I mean?  We know the girl that he, you know, supposedly had, what's the girl in Aruba?  Natalie Holloway.  Right?  But the one, he just killed a girl in Peru.  What's her name?  Um, exactly. 
[00:58:00]  Look how fast you said Natalie.  You said Natalie.  Natalie Holloway.  That angel.  Y'all said that like Family Feud.  All right.  Name a white girl I've been missing for five years in Aruba.  Natalie Holloway.  Survey says.  Name a Peruvian girl that was killed yesterday. 
[00:58:30]  Okay.  What is that big head third world Peruvian bitch's name?  Must have been Yoris or something goofy.  Don't get mad at yourself.  I gave it to you.  You saw how fast she said Natalie Holloway.  Diana Ross right here said Natalie.  She knew her name. 
[00:59:00]  That white girl with Natalie Holloway.  Man, you caught yourself a woo.  God bless you, man.  That is high level right there.  Don't be ashamed of it, gorgeous.  She's mad as hell.  Fuck that white bitch.  What?  You know.  Come on.  Come on. 
[00:59:30]  Ain't nobody looking for you.  I might look for you.  But the news ain't.  You think Fox is reporting you missing?  Let's be honest.  Nancy Grace.  She leads story on Nancy Grace for the next six months.  Look at her.  Look at her.  I'm looking at her because she's mad as hell.  Black woman.  I don't like that shit.  But it is what it is.  Let's be.  I'm not going to be like that.  Let's be honest. 
[01:00:00]  That little girl that went missing.  She was sailing.  Little girl.  I forgot her damn name.  But she went sailing and went missing.  In the Indian Ocean.  Okay.  And they spent.  Good Lord.  Her mask broke and she was floating around.  And she gave out her little signal.  Her beacon.  They looked for her.  They spent $500,000.  Like tax money to search for her.  Now if that's my daughter.  I want that to happen too.  But.  But. 
[01:00:30]  If you go sailing.  Let's be honest.  How long do you think.  Are they going to spend five?  Come on.  Remember.  Hey.  Remember football players in Miami.  Went missing.  They went sailing.  They look for them for eight minutes.  Maybe.  They just sent somebody at the edge of the beach.  I don't see him. 
[01:01:00]  We have to call off the search.  Because there's too much sun.  It's sun.  The conditions are abnormally difficult.  If I go sailing.  I'm taking a white baby on a key chain with me.  If my boat go down.  They going to find me.  I'm going to have it hooked right to the side.  Of my belt. 
[01:01:30]  And I'm going to dress the baby real white too.  I'm going to put sweatpants on it.  And.  A pair of Ugg boots.  And I'm going to.  Take a picture.  Man.  Look at this white baby.  You don't come get me.  This white baby going down with me.  Serious XM.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Hit it.  All right. 
[01:02:00]  I got the big Twitter plug today.  Opie Radio on Twitter.  I just tweeted the picture of the bathroom.  Ha ha.  I beat Jimmy to it.  I'm so busy jerking off to it.  And people are already asking.  They're like.  Is that shit on the floor?  Yes.  That's why I tweeted the picture.  Jesus Christ.  It's all over the fucking place.  Wrong with people.  Check it out on my old Twitter there.  Who's this?  Kiss, right?  Dr. Love? 
[01:02:30]  Jimmy's like dancing.  He's Chris singing.  Oh, is it?  Yeah.  Black Diamond?  What do they sing?  Black Diamond.  Oh, Black Diamond.  I don't know this one.  At least you're close with this.  Pigs work in your building.  Look at the picture.  Show the picture.  Why am I getting no volume in my headphones?  Ah, you have a tumor.  Oh, I thought so.  Thank God.  As long as it's not a technical malfunction.  I hate to see the company happen.  Yeah, the comments are coming in. 
[01:03:00]  Woo-hoo!  Look at this fucking picture, man.  Let me see the duty.  Show me the...  Do your duty.  Oh, my God.  What is that?  Is that, like, shit on the floor?  I'm starting to use the new Twitter filters, and that's the filter called Gritty.  I figured it was perfect for my bathroom picture.  What's it called?  I look at the perfect balance in the photograph itself.  See?  It's in threes.  You got the toilet paper on the left.  You got the blown-up toilet in the middle, and then you got the fucking shit on the right side. 
[01:03:30]  It looks like a cluster bomb of shit went off.  Sounds like shitty.  Someone just writes, oh, my God, is that shit on the floor?  Yes, that's why we're fucking posting this.  Who does this?  And, by the way, under the other stall...  Oh, my God, it's under...  Oh, it's in the next stall.  Yes!  I should have a part two picture.  It's just as bad in the next stall.  I don't understand.  How did that happen?  I don't know.  It's not on the seat.  It's not on the walls.  No.  If the toilet blew up itself, the toilet would be a mess. 
[01:04:00]  And it's not like he bent over and it came shooting out his ass before he sat down.  Possibly, yeah, you got the flu shits, and you're pulling your pants down as you're closing  the stall door, and then...  But there's none on the seat.  And you start bending toward the toilet bowl, and then you let go, I guess?  Because then he got most of it in the toilet.  Oh, it splashed out.  But then he doesn't even flush it.  No, it didn't splash out because the toilet seat is pristine.  Do you think before he sat down, it splashed out and he wiped it off with some toilet paper 
[01:04:30]  and then sat down?  Maybe, yeah.  I don't understand this one.  I don't either.  This is very confusing.  Boggling.  Because a lot of it is in the toilet bowl.  Yes.  So he sprayed before he got to the toilet.  Wow.  Then he probably had to clean off the toilet seat so he could get the rest of it out of  him.  Who do you think it was?  Morning mashup?  It was probably Nicole.  You know what?  It was probably standing Nicole back to back.  It was probably mashup Nicole.  They were doing a romantic comedy movie poster stance while they shat in unison. 
[01:05:00]  That looks like a coke shit.  Yeah.  She sneezed.  Oh no, you know what?  She was, Nicole was going to shit and she screamed at her husband on the phone.  She went, no!  She leaned over and just shot out.  And then just like, blasted.  I hate to say it, but a lot of people are blaming E-Rock.  E-Rock comment.  Oh, E-Rock comment.  E-Rock.  Oh, wait a minute.  No E-Rock in there?  E-Rock.  Why would E-Rock be here?  What?  E-Rock's Christmas break has begun.  We didn't even notice.  Is he really gone?  Yeah.  Apparently everyone is.  I don't understand.  We're the only ones here.  I don't understand why we don't get like time off ever. 
[01:05:30]  We can if we want to.  Let's just take it.  They count our days.  And then when you really want to take the time off and the weather's nice, they're like,  sorry, you ran out of days.  I'd rather take it for Christmas.  E-Rock made the time to have his red suit fitted and his beard put on.  Yeah, his red suit.  He's the only person they've ever said you have to lose a few to play Santa Claus.  Because he's fat.  Yes, he is.  Right?  Yeah.  That's the type of shit you see at a construction site.  Yes.  Spackle bucket shit.  There's DNA and shit.  Get a sample and find the person. 
[01:06:00]  That's a good idea.  Extreme animal.  That's fucking heinous.  Heinous.  Check it out for yourself.  I like the new gritty filter from Twitter.  Yes.  A lot of controversy.  Gritty.  Controversy with Instagram.  Yep.  A lot of people worry that Instagram's going to sell their pictures.  Instagram in general doesn't want your pictures of your shitty kids.  Kids?  I don't think they're going to be selling pictures of your fucking filet mignon that you're eating that night. 
[01:06:30]  But I would say a handful of people are going to get burned by Instagram and your pictures will be sold.  But the rest of us, they're not going to care.  They're just not going to care about our Instagram pictures.  Apparently, their new terms of service there, whatever it is, their service agreement, says that they have the ability, after the 16th of January, to sell your pictures.  Right.  To use them as they deem fit.  Right.  And a lot of people are worried about it, but, I mean, honestly, what are they going to fucking sell, for the most part? 
[01:07:00]  I think it's going to be mostly celebrities that tweet, and, you know, they're out one night, and they want to sell it to TMZ or something like that.  Sure.  They could do it.  But for the most part, no one cares about how the car in front of you was parked diagonally, and you took a picture of it.  Yeah, they don't care.  Yeah, yeah.  It would be fine.  Like, if your photos are that valuable, don't post them on Instagram.  Sell them yourself.  So I guess you're not going to be able to post anything.  Oh, and how do you do that?  With all your valuable pictures.  That's true.  Yes.  And how do you sell those pictures?  Yeah.  I mean, who's selling photos? 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, exactly.  You've got to be one of those old school photographers, I guess, that already has a name for himself.  But if you don't want something to be sold, don't give it away for free.  If you're giving your shit away, then people can sell it.  I don't care.  No one cares.  Everyone wants to be famous, so they throw their stuff out there.  Everyone thinks they're Ansel Adams.  That's right.  Yeah.  So why don't we get Voss in here?  I saw Rich Voss outside with his baby blue backpack.  Needy Rich Voss. 
[01:08:00]  We schedule him for eight, and then he's, like, poking his head in at seven o'clock in the morning.  I asked him for ketchup.  Every single time.  Got some ketchup.  Jesus.  I want to see how long it is before he mispronounces a word.  Let's time it.  Oh, okay.  Fair enough.  All right.  I'm looking at the clock.  Come on, Rich.  Here you go.  No, you've got to wait for him to get our mic.  Yeah.  He's not officially on yet.  I say 726.  No, he's not officially on yet.  Needy?  That's what they were saying.  There you go.  I'm needy?  That's how I'm introduced?  I didn't say that.  No one said that.  I'm needy.  What is needy?  No one said that, Rich. 
[01:08:30]  Paranoid.  Yeah, Rich.  I'm needy.  Like, I'm going to say, oh, oh, please, everybody, come to the stand this weekend where I'm working.  Like, that's needy.  Or Poconuts, New Year's Eve.  That's not fucking needy.  That's not needy.  Not at all.  But I'm not needy.  Yeah, I'm as needy as, you know, fucking anybody that needs stuff.  You know, there's certain things you need.  That's good that you give people some entertainment first before the plugs.  Oh, fuck.  What do you think I, listen, I'm a whole new me. 
[01:09:00]  It's about the plugs, baby.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Okay, not the ones you got in your hair.  This is about getting me.  They weren't plugs, by the way.  They were individual follicles placed artistically in the direction the hair grows.  Yeah, they dropped through the sky and just landed in your head.  Exactly.  Very nice.  I can't believe how amazing you look.  Doesn't Jimmy look nice and svelte?  No, his cock in the bathroom.  Oh, okay.  How could you see it in your mouth?  Rich is quick.  Rich is quick.  Yeah.  Jimmy does look really good.  Thank you.  And you can see, you can tell in pictures now, too. 
[01:09:30]  Like, when he takes pictures here in the studio, it's like, oh, Jimmy's fucking svelte.  But here's the thing.  He does look good, but that should be without saying.  Like, you know, nobody sat here and said, hey, look at this fucking idiot to let himself go.  And now we're all happy that he's back.  Right.  He should have never been where he was.  And it doesn't compensate for the piece of shit he is.  Like, even though he's slender now and looking good, he's still the piece of shit that...  He can hear you.  He's right there.  Hold on.  I don't like a guy like Rich who needs nothing but rewards. 
[01:10:00]  This dummy needs constant rewards.  And yet I lose a little bit of weight.  And he goes, well, you should have looked like that to begin with.  Yes.  Come on.  I'm not going to be very positive.  You look great.  I wish you were.  Okay.  You guys...  I get it.  You guys can never, like, compliment each other.  It's got to be with a fucking slam.  I told Rich to poke my abs.  And he did poke my abs.  But then he raised his shirt and showed me his.  And I knew he would.  His hairy abs. 
[01:10:30]  Did he bend over?  Did he bend over like he does when he does abs?  No, I'm already in the studio.  Why won't I do that?  That's true.  So, uh...  The Vosses took us out for a nice French dinner the other night.  I only talked about it a little bit yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  What's French?  Frenchie food?  French.  Oh, what'd you have?  It's one of the best restaurants in New York.  Love Bernadette.  Did you have a crepe soucette?  What'd you have?  A baguette?  No, it wasn't like...  It felt like it was just, I don't know, almost like a sushi joint.  This was the real deal.  I had like a raw fluke. 
[01:11:00]  Whoa.  That's a fluke.  Moved on to some octopus.  When we were there.  And then I moved on to some red snapper.  This was sort of like fucking Japanese, it felt like to me.  First of all, first thing, Lindsay, they came and put her pocketbook on like a little stool.  It was on the floor.  What?  And they...  You know when you go to a restaurant and you're like, ah, you put your shit on the floor?  Yeah, yeah.  They ran over immediately like, how dare you?  And they had a purse stool.  This is how fancy this joint was.  I thought it was for me to get up in the seat. 
[01:11:30]  I saw Rich when I first got to the table and he's dressed nice, I'm dressed nice.  We start openly laughing at each other.  I'm like, I know.  I haven't worn a suit.  Yeah.  I don't even know.  I think since Patrice's funeral.  I don't wear suits, but this idiot goes, you have to wear a suit for this joint.  This idiot?  I didn't make the rules.  Oh, sorry.  I'm sorry.  He's right here.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Freddie Flannel on every occasion.  This is the top.  I mean, this was the whitest place I've ever been to. 
[01:12:00]  This looked like...  Extremely white.  What was it called?  Paradise?  No.  Well, you dropped your napkin.  Then he sits down and he drops his napkin right away, right?  And there was someone over to our table within seconds.  You have to give me a napkin.  Wow.  And he goes, no, I don't need a new one.  Yeah.  I mean, it's...  And I respected that.  I'm like, yeah, you don't need a new one.  You just dropped it.  Who cares?  We are...  What do you call it?  It looked like just like, I guess, relatives of plantation owners. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, really?  I mean, everybody in there.  Yeah.  The waystaff was amazing.  I've never seen anybody that...  You know, if that place burned down while we were all in it, we would have got rid of a lot  of corruption.  Oh, yeah.  You think it was like bankers?  There was a lot of corruption in that fucking room.  Politicians.  And the thing is, when you're...  Like, Lindsay and Bonnie could talk for hours.  They're broads.  Me and him got nothing.  We just stared at each other.  Oh, man, really?  We have three subjects we talk about.  Golf.  Yeah. 
[01:13:00]  Golf.  The movie?  Golf.  You know, we're talking about golf and Opie's like, yeah, I'm going to start playing again.  And I'm like, yeah, I can't wait.  You know, that bullshit.  And then we're back and forth, like...  And those two are just like, wow, man.  Yapping away.  I just want to eat.  Like, that's the first time either one of them has had anybody intelligent to talk to.  Finally, someone fucking talked to them.  To actually listen to each other is really strange to watch.  Really strange.  Both of them were so shocked that they had to say something that wasn't followed with, 
[01:13:30]  what do you mean?  Right.  You're right.  I think you look great.  You're right.  And, like, and I've never seen, like, you know, this is a nice meal, these people.  I mean, you know, this is a lot of money.  It was an amazing meal.  We're beating it up a little bit.  Thank God he, you know, could Twitter and Instagram nonsense.  I'd hate to see you having sex.  Like, do you pause to say, oh, hold on, Lindsay, I got to put out the funny mofos? 
[01:14:00]  Oh, that's funny mofo time.  He's taking pictures of the food.  I couldn't help it.  I haven't been to a fancy joint like that in a while.  So I took pictures of our, look, look at, there's you eating I don't even know what.  That was crab with Brussels sprouts.  I hate Brussels sprouts, by the way.  I love them.  So I didn't try that one.  Me too.  That's why we have, that's why we're in love.  Exactly.  Our balls look like Brussels sprouts.  Look how Rich is all dressed all nice.  The other thing is the IQ on the plate is more than he is. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  He's talking about, oh boy.  Wait, let me ask you a question.  Whose restaurant is that?  It's like a top, top chef.  It's just a top chef.  Oh, not anybody.  How did you guys get in there, I'm saying?  Like, meaning, what made you go there?  Oh, that's a very good question.  Bonnie, okay, Bonnie did this roast.  Yeah, I did it too.  Yeah, okay.  All right, calm down.  No, no, that's why he's going to get mad, because he probably didn't get the same deal that  No, no, it's different.  It's not from the guy from, you know, when you guys roast, what's his name? 
[01:15:00]  Bourdain.  Bourdain.  Some other chef was there.  Guy Fieri?  No, no.  Not like a hamburger chef.  And he's the head chef for this joint.  Can I help your story along?  Yeah, go ahead.  Holy fuck, it's not even my story.  Rich, you're bumming.  Can I help your story along?  What up, I'm trying to tell the story.  Was he on the roast, the guy?  Was he on the dais?  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah, exactly.  He's the French guy.  Yeah, Eric Repair, probably.  Yeah, yeah.  Fuck him.  I was up there with him.  He couldn't invite me to his shitty restaurant. 
[01:15:30]  No, that's not why he invited you.  Sorry, Eric.  That's not why he's quick.  He doesn't even wait for the explanation.  Would you have given him a handjob after the roast?  Yes.  Okay, well, he'd be angry.  Nothing he'd want one from her.  No, so he's the head chef at this amazing restaurant, which was one of the top restaurants  in New York City, and then Bonnie wrote some jokes for him for another roast.  Not for a roast for something.  Oh, I see.  Okay, yeah.  See how easy that is to do, Rich?  There you go.  I would have got to that, except I had to send out a tweet. 
[01:16:00]  Okay.  Did they comp the meal?  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah, I mean, they comp the meal.  Well, they made us look like assholes at the end.  Well, because we look like fancy people when we have to, and I go, you know, can I have  the bill, because we want to make sure we leave a tip.  We know that we weren't, we were pretty much eating for free.  Okay, Ralph.  She goes, she doesn't say it's on the house or anything.  She goes, yeah.  Oh, you guys bartered.  Yeah, this has been bartered.  That word is.  Yeah, like, she just said, oh, you're calm.  You look like an asshole. 
[01:16:30]  She goes, it's bartered.  Yeah, we painted the place earlier.  Right.  You know, we did the paddling.  Maybe that, but then again, it's bartered.  Maybe that's the term.  Maybe that's the term that's acceptable in that world.  Because she wouldn't be rude.  The bartering is like, here, I'm going to buy some hubcaps, and you're going to  paint my fence.  That's bartering.  Maybe they do it for each other all the time.  Like, maybe Guy Fieri or whatever will go in there and fucking battalion.  They'll go, oh, no, it's been bartered for, like, a trip to my restaurant.  I don't want to confuse this.  The experience was amazing.  The food was amazing.  The service was amazing.  The food was amazing.  The joint was nice.  You know? 
[01:17:00]  All the waiters have, like, medallions on.  I don't know what the fuck that means.  I think you said that it looks like they won gold medals.  They were the best waiters in New York.  I want to eat there.  Is that what that is?  Give me a spot.  No, you are so dumb.  Oh, you're telling me I'm dumb.  They came in and gave them medals.  Dude, I don't know the restaurant world.  I don't know the restaurant world.  They accepted them.  The black waiters held up their fists.  Fair enough.  And they had their medals taken away.  Fair enough.  Fair enough. 
[01:17:30]  What's the Michelin award and all that shit?  What is all that crap?  Oh, it's for tires.  E-Rock.  What are some of those restaurant awards?  The Michelin is the highest rate.  And why would they have those fucking things around their neck?  It had to mean something.  Huh?  I don't know.  Listen, I don't know.  I got smashed deservedly.  But what were they?  The food was good.  I'd like to also learn.  There were certain.  I think there were medallions saying they were probably the head waiters above the bread  waiters, the other waiters.  Just so you know who to look at. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  Like when you need the real deal waiter.  Just to know who speaks English?  I did.  They were probably just like the headliners of the waiters.  Show the other food pictures.  And then.  So we could.  Sam.  See, when you go to those restaurants, because we've been to a lot of those, you know, when  I had the Oscar gift basket, there was like five restaurants.  You know, these are restaurants you don't even know until, because you're not in that  world.  Look at that.  And they bring it.  Oh, wow.  That is raw fluke, which is amazing.  I want to eat in a couple of these places.  Highly recommend anyone into the sushi. 
[01:18:30]  If you've never tried fluke, try the fluke.  What's that?  And that's a carrot, ginger, mini bread, I believe.  It was delicious?  Yeah, the portions were tiny, but I got home and I was so fucking full.  Sometimes that's great when they're small.  Yeah, it's great because you think you're not eating as much, but my stomach told me,  no, you ate a lot, you asshole.  No, see, I can't.  I was taken off of Bonnie's plate and, you know.  Like Helen Keller just walking around grabbing food off the plates. 
[01:19:00]  What was that?  That was a little, uh...  That was in the beginning.  A little filet.  What is that?  A little tuna.  Oh.  A little sample plate to start to eat.  You know, you can tune a piano.  Is it hard to get reservations here?  Huh?  Same.  And a cauliflower soup on the right, Jimmy.  Ooh!  That soup.  Cauliflower soup.  That soup was so good.  It was ridiculous.  Put an email in the flour.  I'm telling you.  Cauliflower...  Oh, God, that was the worst one ever.  What did he say?  A cauliflower soup.  This is an email. 
[01:19:30]  Email-y flour.  Email-y flour.  Cauliflower.  But the only problem with the cauliflower soup is it was only a sip.  Like, you take a sip, you go, this is amazing, and then you look around to see where the  rest of it is.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Well, that's how they do it at these places, you know, because I freak with them a lot.  They're schmancy, yeah.  And the people that follow him on Twitter are like, oh, look, Rich Voss, we know he has  a little money.  Listen to me.  I have no fucking money.  I don't know what this perception...  I don't think anybody had the perception you had.  No.  There's one guy on Twitter who's less... 
[01:20:00]  They assumed that he has money, and he brought us there.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, like, there's a picture of my Rolex, and they're doing things on Rolex.  Oh, he's got a Rolex.  You know, hey, I got two of them.  Big fucking deal.  It means nothing.  They're going to be taken away soon.  Believe me.  There's things happening.  Oh, Rich.  Are you in trouble?  Bill collectors.  Pass that.  Oh, no.  Oh, Rich.  I can't talk about it.  Please don't ask me for money.  That would be awkward when I have to say no.  Is that new?  What?  Yeah, I just did on a...  Oh, man, what'd you do? 
[01:20:30]  A tattoo show.  Because I had covered up...  You did the cover-up show?  Yeah.  Tattoo Nightmares?  No, I did the other one.  The worst tattoos with Megan Massacre.  Oh.  With the red hair from New York Inc.  Is she pretty?  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Oh, right.  Yeah, she's kind of hot.  They covered...  Because I figured...  They did a good job.  Yeah, I don't want...  It's free.  I mean, I'm not supposed to have tattoos as a Jew, but it's free, so God's going to say  hey.  That's a real dilemma for God.  Yeah, you're strange.  Yeah, where was the original?  That tribal piece. 
[01:21:00]  Where was it?  It was...  I understand where...  It's a cover-up.  I had it...  I had it...  It's on my ankle.  Here you go.  It's on my ankle.  You fucking as dumb as him, idiot.  Where was the other one?  I understand, Reg.  How about under it?  You know, kind of like when you cover your car.  I gotcha, boss.  Where was the other one?  I meant where in the work.  In the tat.  The whole thing is covered.  I'll show you a picture.  It's amazing.  They did a great job. 
[01:21:30]  Isn't it?  But my arm's still sore a month later.  Yeah.  I don't know if it should be.  I asked, what's his name?  It looks very infected.  Yeah, I can't wait until they have to fucking lop that arm off.  Oh, God.  Like they did your chin.  Oh, wow.  That's a sensitive thing for me.  Is that sensitive?  Rich, you're very on guard today.  He puts a kettlebell in his mouth and swings around trying to work his chin up.  I'm getting it from both ends.  What are you guys, fricking frack or something?  You can say whatever you want, you Jewy Kike burger. 
[01:22:00]  My mother always told me that you people like pennies.  Jewy Kike burger.  Fucking give a fuck.  Fucking fuck.  Jewy Kike burger.  Rich, why are you so aggressive today?  Because I'm not aggressive at all.  I just, you come in here.  You fucking come in here.  Wow, we've been nothing but nice to you.  Nice.  He's needy.  Let me tell the story.  Jewy Kike burger, which is my favorite.  That's true.  Look at this.  This is what they covered up. 
[01:22:30]  What do you, let me see.  Oh, yeah, okay.  Oh, yeah, I sort of remember that.  That's fucking amazing.  Oh, wow, that's pretty fucking good.  I didn't know they kept the bottom part.  Yeah.  I can still see the travel piece there, though.  Where?  It's hard to see it.  No, it's not.  Where can you see it?  I got to go to the bathroom picture again, and I got to give stoned-typing guy a lot of  credit today.  He came up with the line.  It's Mel Carmisen's goodbye present.  That'd be great. 
[01:23:00]  He's in there just dumping mud.  Everyone's trying to outdo each other with their lines.  That guy wins.  Stone-typing guy, bravo.  Let me see, Sam.  Who is she?  It looks like she has red hair now.  I want to kiss her hiney and sniff it.  She's all right.  I like tattoo chicks.  Yeah.  As far as tat chicks go, she's pretty hot.  Tat chicks aren't normally hot.  Sorry.  Tat chicks scare me.  Yes.  They kind of scare me.  Oh, man. 
[01:23:30]  Yes, they are scary, right?  Yes.  Oh, with the red hair.  She's way better.  She looks good with the red hair.  But what if they had tattoos of sunsets?  Would that be...  That would be nice.  That would be nice, right?  That would be very nice.  Very nice.  Yeah, this thing is still sore a month later.  Yeah, it's probably fucked up.  There's something wrong with it.  It should not be sore a month later, dummy.  That's a lot.  That's a lot of work.  She did nerve damage.  No, she did do nerve damage.  Here's the thing.  A lot of nerve damage.  Here's the thing.  Some nerve.  It's a cover-up, so it takes more time.  Yeah.  How could she do nerve damage? 
[01:24:00]  She didn't dig under into a nerve.  Well...  And you know what I like?  Norton's probably one of the smartest people I know.  He knows a lot about astronomy.  Throw the break.  He knows a lot about...  Yeah, because it's only going to get bad from here.  He knows a lot about astronomy.  We talk...  It really depresses me as he says that,  and then he's going to ask me about being a Capricorn.  Astronomy.  No, he's stuff...  And he knows a lot.  And he knows a lot about tattoos,  because he has not one on him.  Oh, shit. 
[01:24:30]  That is a good point.  But then again, I know a lot about flying.  I'm not a pilot.  Huh?  Oh, that's true.  Yeah.  I know a lot about fucking cock sucking.  I'm not a cock...  That's...  Oh, see what happened there, what you did.  Hey, um...  Aw.  Rich.  You'd tat very well, because you're very pale.  Yeah, you would look...  You would tattoo well.  Dude, they could tattoo loose leaf on my stomach,  and you'd see it.  Because I'm white as a motherfucker.  Y'all.  Jesus.  You could get scallops tattooed on you.  We did. 
[01:25:00]  Rich, do you like Billy Crystal?  Oh, boy.  What do you mean?  What?  They all hide.  They all hide from this guy.  I like Billy.  Here's Billy Crystal.  Jimmy's a big fan of Billy Crystal.  Here's what I like about Billy Crystal.  Oh, it's not so much.  Yeah.  He was great in Mr. Saturday Night.  Really?  Yeah.  That movie.  Yeah, I know.  And I haven't seen anything since,  so I don't know what he's done since then.  Has he done anything?  I thought he kind of retired. 
[01:25:30]  There's a big movie coming out with the Bette Midler.  I can't wait to see that.  Oh, it looks great.  So that means he's all over the place.  He was on SportsCenter last night.  Oh, boy.  And he's got a Christmas song out.  Do we have the Christmas song?  Is it Merry Fucking Christmas?  Oh, that's right.  Who's in the booth?  Do you have a video?  Travis is.  Trav Don!  I can't see anyone.  I can't see you, Travis.  Sorry.  Just call him bitch-ass motherfuckers.  Is that Jay Moore?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  He's on Imus a lot.  He looks like the beard.  He looks like an author.  He looks like Tom Shalhoub if he was stung by a hornet's nest. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, my God.  Look at Imus's old lady hair.  I took out when he was being interviewed by the undead.  He looks like Ozzy in the Shot in the Dark video with that jacket.  Shot in the dark.  One step away from here.  He looks like a woman now, Imus.  Yeah, Imus is really.  Jay Moore got the big Jim Rohn gig.  Like, I've fallen and I can't get up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Imus is morning.  What do you mean?  What is ratings?  What do you mean he got the Jim Rohn gig?  Very well.  Jay Moore just got a huge radio show. 
[01:26:30]  He's taking over for Jim Rohn on Fox, what is it?  Fox Sports.  Good for Jay, man.  We're very happy for Jay Moore.  That is very cool.  So, congratulate Jay Moore.  Jay Moore 37 on Twitter.  I like Colin's tweet about it that he's available to do characters for Jay's show.  Colin could have the funniest Twitter account out there.  It's really, really great.  It's fucking hilarious.  It's great.  Love Colin.  So, do you like fucking Billy Crystal or not?  And do you want to hear his Christmas song?  Here's the thing with Billy Crystal. 
[01:27:00]  Oh, boy.  I loved him when he was a comedy team with Dave Hawthorne.  Was he in London?  Yeah.  There were a comedy team with Dave Hawthorne.  I'll preface it by saying this.  You're funnier than Billy Crystal.  Well, it's...  You're funnier than Billy Crystal as much as we beat the fuck out of you.  I'm funnier than nine-tenths of the comics on the planet.  Slow down.  Slow down.  Just say 90%, dummy.  Nine-tenths.  You want to hear the Christmas song?  Please.  Oh, wait.  Billy's got a Christmas song?  What is it called, Travis? 
[01:27:30]  What's it called?  What's it called?  Oh, I'm sorry.  It's called the Christmas song.  Hi, Dave.  Oh.  It's Sammy here with a little...  Oh, no!  All right.  Hey.  All right.  Stop this.  All right.  Hold it right there.  We got to start over.  Is this an old song?  Is this an old song that he did when he was on SNL?  I don't know.  Is it?  I heard there's a...  I don't know, but I'm seeing that it was imported into this system like five days ago.  That means it's a new song.  I'm assuming it's an old song.  No?  I have some kind of YouTube thing  that says it was uploaded in 2009. 
[01:28:00]  Nine?  So...  Nine!  We've never played the Billy Pistol Christmas song.  And I'm wondering if there's a newer one than this one.  I think this is the one.  All right.  And I don't think...  It's not old, like...  Okay.  1985.  Huh.  People were tweeting me yesterday like he has a new one out.  Hey, man.  We can still play this.  Who cares?  Yeah.  I don't think there's a new one.  I don't think I've ever heard this.  Most people could tweet a fucking link.  Yeah.  If you got more info on that, please help us out. 
[01:28:30]  If not, no worries.  But everybody wants to hear any Billy Pistol Christmas song.  It doesn't matter whether it's old or new.  You like him.  I'm a big fan.  No, you're not.  I'm a big fan.  No one's a big fan of Billy Pistol.  I'm sorry.  You could be a fan of him.  No one's a big fan of his.  When he was on Soap?  Oh, yes.  Yeah, but then he got off it after rehab.  Soap.  That was 77, I think.  Yeah.  That was.  Yeah, that was a long time ago.  I got to update my material. 
[01:29:00]  All right, let's listen to the Christmas song by Billy Pistol.  Oh, great.  Sammy.  Hi, babes.  It's Sammy here with a little package for you.  What's these impersonations?  And it's a gift that keeps giving.  It's the Christmas song.  Oh, good.  Okay.  Chestnuts roasting on that open fire.  Yeah.  Did Sammy sound like this?  Jack Frost looks marvelous.  Ah! 
[01:29:30]  Get your nose.  Oh, I hate when that happens.  Hello once again, everyone.  Yuletide carols are being sung by a quiet as we speak right there.  Howard Cosell.  And these folks, you know, they're dressed up like Eskimos.  It's unbelievable.  Don't get me started with these Eskimos.  Are they Hawaiians or Indians or what?  Everybody knows.  The talent.  Turkey, my friends.  Some mistletoe.  Some beverages by Harmon.  Joe Franklin?  Joe Franklin?  No.  Yeah.  They all helped to make that season bright. 
[01:30:00]  Willie?  Oh, this makes me want to go see Paul Bonds.  Oh, he didn't say it.  Saving it up.  He's loaded lots of toys and goodies. 
[01:30:30]  Joe Franklin.  Two minutes to go, by the way.  Are we going to make it?  Two minutes?  Two minutes?  We're running around the house, places we go on us, with a flap on the pajamas, with  their little bush sticking out, looking up into the night to see if those reindeer really  know how to fly.  Great reindeer are going to fly.  They're going to leave a danish on my windshield from 100 feet.  Holy shit, he's just so funny and rapid fire.  It's pretty clever.  I know.  I'm surprised by the way.  We're running in fucking aggravating everybody during the song. 
[01:31:00]  Billy, let me help you with the song.  Many times, many ways.  Like a way that I write and say things are funny.  Oh, stream of consciousness is hilarious.  Oh, have a nice Christmas, but don't forget to take the pins out of your new shirts when  you try them on.  Otherwise, it's very painful.  Oh, you're done. 
[01:31:30]  You stink!  This is horrible.  The song's old, but it's still fucking horrible.  It's a good thing he's not trying to throw in too much shit into the song.  It could be the wordiest song in the history of music.  Holy fuck, right?  Christmas, my friend, share it with Eddie Cantor, Buster Keaton, and May Bush.  Oh, darling.  Merry Christmas.  Have a great Christmas, and to my Jewish friends, have a very happy harmonica.  Ah, harmonica!  It sounds like Hanukkah, but it's... 
[01:32:00]  Whoa.  Whatever.  What we're trying to say, folks, from us to you is simply...  Merry Christmas to everyone!  To you...  You...  Shut up!  This was a nice Christmas...  To the bathroom...  Close and...  How you're doing L.I.P. replace?  He does these impersonations. 
[01:32:30]  I swear, you would think it was the real people.  Jimmy's back.  Jimmy, you missed Billy Crystal.  You missed the Billy Crystal Christmas song.  I was pre-taping some...  You want us to play the game?  No, I don't want to interfere with the flow.  You sure?  Yeah, all right.  I'll listen to it later.  Yeah, yeah.  If he didn't get a record contract after that.  Huge.  Yeah, he should have.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  He stinks.  You know, here's...  He stinks.  No, this is for real.  He had to touch fucking nothing. 
[01:33:00]  That's old.  That's like 30 years old.  Oh, yeah.  I know.  Here's the thing, too.  You got to take it in consideration.  That guy got really famous on what?  You got to take it in consideration.  That's...  Listen, he's...  If he came out doing young stuff, you would go,  Oh, look at him trying to be young.  That's what...  That's his audience.  That's who likes that stuff.  He's only going with...  By the way, this is the conversation Rich has had about himself in the mirror.  Yeah, shut up, stupid.  Do we have the clips from SportsCenter? 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, a couple.  All right.  Do you want to hear how he did?  Billy Crystal, you know, he's promoting that movie,  so he's going to be all over the place,  and he made his way to SportsCenter yesterday.  Let me play the ad.  Yeah.  Vodka.  You can talk while I play the ad.  Drink some vodka.  Yeah, let's talk about the ad.  Get my lost profits seat.  They listen to it.  I don't know what to do, Sam.  Well, you were actually in the middle of a sentence,  so I was just figuring you could...  Here he is.  How about I just pick a random baseball figure 
[01:34:00]  and ask for your best story about him?  You ready?  Tim, you ready?  I drilled a hole.  All right, just top of my head.  Ted Williams.  Tim, you go.  All right, 1982, it was old-timers game at Fenway Park,  and Ted Williams was coming to the batting cage.  Remember, I grew up with a father  who worshipped Ted Williams in a baseball sense.  I heard stories about him every day of my life.  Ted Williams' head looks marvelous.  And now I'm 23 years old, on the field at Fenway,  and Ted Williams is 10 feet away from me. 
[01:34:30]  As soon as he walks out of the dugout,  the whole ballpark basically stops and watches him  because he's the great Ted Williams.  He steps in the batter's box.  Remember now, he's 64 years old.  He digs in just like he did in 1941,  and I'm thinking, oh my goodness,  I'm seeing Ted Williams right here.  And the first pitch, he hits a one-hopper  into the bullpen in right center field,  and I'm 10 feet away from the batting cage.  It was like, oh my gosh, I saw the great Ted Williams, 
[01:35:00]  and as soon as that day was over...  I went to the Whites Only Fountain.  And I said, pop, I saw Ted Williams.  I saw him from 10 feet away.  It was one of the great thrills.  Right!  This is cool.  I don't think you can top that, Billy.  Well, now we don't have time for my story.  Ah, that's kind of funny.  Take a shot.  That was long-winded.  All right, so it's my 50th birthday.  30 years ago.  30 years ago.  Very angry that I'd gotten my AARP card in the mail that day.  How did I know?  Anyway, the phone rings. 
[01:35:30]  My wife, Janice, answered.  She said, yeah, he's right here.  It's for you.  I'm going to mention his wife.  One for two so far.  Here's what I hear.  Hey, kid, it's Ted Williams.  Your beautiful wife tracked me down  and invited me to your party tonight,  but I've got to tell you,  the good Lord is pitching me tight,  so I can't get there.  But let me ask you something.  You're involved with the Diamondback team, aren't you?  We were minority owners then.  Yeah.  And I don't mean minority of the Diamondback.  So that's what I'd like to play.  You know, in that Arizona, that dry heat,  you know, you hit a ball with the right topspin.  I'd hit 285, 310 there. 
[01:36:00]  I said, 285, 310?  He said, Billy, I'm 87.  I'm in a wheelchair.  Oh.  Boom!  I certainly did.  But it was great to talk to him.  It's not bad.  One of a kind.  That's a true story.  That's not bad.  The good news that the Yankees might finish last.  No, I don't want to talk to him anymore.  No.  Thanks, Tim.  Thank you for springing up such an unpleasant subject.  Why don't you give me a paper cut and pour lemon juice in it?  We're closed.  Very good, Miracle Max.  That was terrific.  He was doing an old Billy Crystal bit. 
[01:36:30]  Right there.  All right.  That was a good story.  I mean...  And I can't stand that motherfucker.  But that wasn't bad.  Ted Williams called him and said that.  Okay.  It was probably a standard Ted Williams joke.  Of course.  We have another clip.  Ten years from now, or 20 years, that's Adam Ferraro and Mike Bibiglia talking.  Adam Ferraro?  Ferraro.  Adam Ferraro.  Is that what would happen if fucking Adam Ferraro starred in Rosemary's Baby?  You fucking idiot.  You've got ours wrestling in your mouth.  I shot a Ferraro in the air.  I don't know.  I was married to Woody Allen. 
[01:37:00]  My name is Adam.  No one could see, Rich.  It's okay.  Yeah, he's right there.  Yeah, he's up top.  Uh, you can own a piece of what?  Presidential history.  Oh.  What is this?  Barack Obama victory dollar.  Who would buy that?  How much is it?  50 cents?  Take us out, you no motherless cock.  It's probably a penny.  No motherless.  It's a double negative.  You can only get cheese, cereal, and milk with it.  Exactly.  Why don't we play...  The new entitlement dollar. 
[01:37:30]  Let's play one more.  All right.  Let's see.  Billy Crystal's parental guidance.  Billy...  Oh, because he's in that movie, Parental Guidance.  Parental Guidance.  All right.  We'll tie in to the big movie.  Now, I can't teach the superstars of the NBA how to drain every three-pointer or consistently  run a perfect fast break or solve the mysteries of the free-throw line or to figure out the  end of Homeland.  But what I can offer them is this some parental guidance.  Right with the Homeland jokes.  Get it?  Topical.  Try to be patient with your friends.  They're really trying their best.  So don't fire your coach until after the holidays, okay? 
[01:38:00]  It's not nice.  James, the beard.  It's leave the look for Santa.  It's a little too breaking Amish for me.  KG, enough.  Come on.  It's time to forgive your friend Ray Allen.  He's just riffing.  Come on.  He's riffing.  Mello, be a little nicer to Mike D'Antonio next time you see him, okay?  He's coaching senior citizens now.  It's a little difficult.  Dwight, three words for you before your next free throw.  LASIK's eye surgery.  And finally, LeBron.  The other day, Kobe said Carmelo was tougher to guard than you. 
[01:38:30]  It's no big deal.  I just thought you might want to know for the next time.  Be more funny.  There you have it.  Some parental guidance from Grandpa B.  No.  Is this this guy?  No.  I love how Homer feels about his appearance.  This is going great.  Is it?  Is it, Homer?  All right, you know.  All right, Billy.  Yikes.  Makes $20 million a year.  Leave him alone.  He's a comic.  He's talking about sports. 
[01:39:00]  I think he does a great job.  I mean, who knows that much about sports as a comedian?  You know, I mean, plus he had a lot on his mind after the 2012 or the 12-12, you know.  12-12-12?  That debacle.  It's terrible.  What was it?  What?  Well, Billy Crystal was terrible.  You were so funny.  I was dying at your stuff.  Oh, God.  I can't stop tweeting with that shit when that happens.  It's so funny.  You're being requested to stop chewing in the mic.  Oh, please.  Stop chewing in the mic. 
[01:39:30]  Nicotine gum still?  Levy was hilarious, too.  Hilarious.  He was really funny.  Andy is a funny fucking tweet.  No, Bob, dummy.  Andy Levy's great, too.  Bob Levy's funny, too.  Absolutely.  Cha.  All right.  Where are you going to be, Voss?  We're going to take a break.  I think Laszlo's coming in today.  Ooh, Laszlo.  And then we got, man, I don't know.  We got Jaden James and Jaden Cole.  And E-Rock just sent me an email. 
[01:40:00]  Should I read it?  Sure.  You sure?  I'm hungry.  Send food.  We got some controversy with people that we absolutely love.  What is this?  Red Band, who's Joe Rogan's producer.  Yeah.  They're pissed over there in the Joe Rogan camp.  About what?  Brian Red Band sent this to pass along to you guys.  This is from E-Rock, who's sort of working from home today.  He's done for the year.  At least he's working from somewhere.  He wrote, tomorrow you have the Jadens on.  Can they ask why they're called the Death Squad and try to sue us, even though I started 
[01:40:30]  their show on Death Squad?  Oh, shit.  Their podcast is called Sex Squad.  Let me tell you something, brother.  I'm just reading this.  Sounds like a wrestler.  Don't fucking blame me.  I'm just reading this.  He writes, and this is from Joe Rogan's people, Red Band.  Jaden James is a cunt.  Wow.  Also, Jaden James used Chuck Liddell to get free press, and there's a link to that.  220 in her old website a few months ago bragged about celebrities she has slept with. 
[01:41:00]  She's garbage, lies, and uses people, including my Death Squad brand.  Have so much dirt on her, but I don't want to be sued.  Well.  Well, let's ask her.  This is juicy.  Yeah, we should ask what this is about.  They're pissed, and they're asking us to at least bring it up.  Let's bring it up.  I don't know.  We've never met Jaden James.  I have no idea what this is all about.  I don't either.  Oh, my God.  Have we met her or no?  I don't think so.  I didn't know Rogan had a camp.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God, yeah. 
[01:41:30]  She does Who Kids show.  He's got a camp on her.  Oh, yeah?  Does she?  Mm-hmm.  Who does?  Jaden James does?  Mm-hmm.  Is she cool?  You meet her?  When I met her, she was cool, but she's never tried to sue me.  What are they producing?  I mean, promoting.  The girls, I don't know what.  You get their sheets around your stomach.  Okay.  What are they promoting?  Yeah.  Probably titties or something.  A lot of people.  A lot of people check it in.  Are we going to see tits?  Yeah.  Chipstick.  What's that?  In Ireland.  I need a spring of something.  This guy's saying it.  I have no fucking idea, because I don't feel like getting sued.  Yeah.  They fucked Red Band and our UFC boy, Chuck Liddell. 
[01:42:00]  What happened with Chuck Liddell?  I don't know.  According to the email, it was said that she used him to get pressed, but I don't know  what that means.  In what context?  The use of the word bitch and the use of the word fag in the long form.  They just had me...  I don't like that language.  Whoa.  Who's that?  That's her.  Holy fuck.  I don't care what the hell she did.  I know.  She's really good.  She's lovely.  It's...  Let me see her face.  Shut up. 
[01:42:30]  You think I can put my hand down her pants?  Well, we've got to bring it up, right?  I mean, Joe Rogan, we're close to Joe Rogan and the guys over there.  And I like Brian, too, so we'll ask him.  It's fair questions.  They're pissed that they're coming on our show.  I'm sorry.  They're not telling us not to, obviously.  They're just mad, you know?  That's crazy hot right there.  Certainly, we would throw off a similar email to them if something was going down.  Hold on.  She's promoting the fact that I'm working in Buffalo New Year's Eve.  That's very nice of the girls to promote that.  December 28th through 31st.  And I'll be in Nashville January 10th through 12th. 
[01:43:00]  And I'll be in San Diego January 25th, 26th.  At least for the rest of your life, you'll be able to say,  I remember where I was New Year's Eve 2013.  Well, also February 17th, I'll be at the Borgata with David Tell, Amy Schumer,  and Arnie Lang and myself.  I might go to that show to not see it and gamble.  Oh, we have a free night.  When is it?  January.  No, Feb, Feb, F-E-B, period. 
[01:43:30]  We have a free night.  This is a radio voice.  I like that voice.  It's good.  You want to know the Chuck Liddell story?  No, let me tell you what I'm at.  Let's get the Chuck Liddell story out there.  I want people to hear.  Apparently, he was either engaged or just broke off his engagement.  To her?  No.  Oh, to somebody else?  Yeah, and she was partying with him in Mexico and posted the pictures all over the internet.  Oh, sort of like, hey, look at me.  But is that just celebrity pictures posted?  No, no, no, like, pictures of them, like, obviously not just, look, it's me and Chuck 
[01:44:00]  Liddell, like, making out or whatever.  It seems like she has a reputation for talking about what celebrity she's fucked.  Oh, no.  I hope she doesn't fuck me and talk about it.  Oh, that would be terrible, right?  I'd love it.  Stevie would be all about that.  What a horror show that would be.  Yeah, I know.  It'd be the shortest story she ever told.  Well, obviously, some of the guys don't want that shit out there.  Oh, my God, dude.  She's fucking sexy.  She is sexy.  Well, now, see, that's very pretty.  That's very, very pretty.  What is she promoting? 
[01:44:30]  Thank you, Captain.  Her breasts.  She's got this sheet in front of you.  I don't read.  All right, well, we got to ask her about it, so we will.  We do ask her.  Is that her second picture in, laying down on the bed?  Yeah, that's her.  Fucking click on that, you fag.  You got it.  Do it.  Yeah, you fucking Peter Pumper.  Stop it, shit.  Oh, my God, look at that.  It's a little airbrush.  What?  That's not an airbrush.  What's wrong with you?  How do you know that?  Look at those green eyes.  You look like a person.  Not being such a twit.  Oh, shut up, Sam.  Shut your face.  Sorry, sorry.  Her eyes aren't that color anyway.  What? 
[01:45:00]  That's what she looks like.  She's promoting.  Stick my cock between those tits.  You would do that?  Yeah, I would do that.  I haven't done that in so long.  You haven't?  No.  Why?  Me and Noah don't hang out that much anymore.  Oh, shit.  Loss is on fire.  Holy fuck.  Stay out of his way.  This weekend, I'm at the stand, a new club in New York.  It's a good club, the stand.  It's on the east side.  And New Year's Eve at Poconuts in Stillwater, Pennsylvania.  Poconuts. 
[01:45:30]  Bonnie and I will be working together.  Is that her naked?  Yeah, let's see the news.  Click on it, you fruit.  I want to see her vagina, you fucking man lover.  Oh, man.  Show me, Sam.  Turn it.  That's some good implants right there.  Yeah, not too fucking hard.  I think I want to have sexual intercourse with her.  Yeah, I think you're right.  What are my odds?  What are my odds?  Holy shit!  She's got the big lips Jimmy likes.  Sorry, Red Band.  Oh, my God.  Look at her pussy.  I love you, Joe.  Red Band can go fuck himself.  Yeah, Red Band.  We're getting weak.  Joe who?  Sorry.  Chuck who?  We're showing weakness.  Show me her vagina, Sam. 
[01:46:00]  She's hypnotized us with her vag.  Does that really get you excited?  More than yes.  I think a pretty face is...  Shut your mouth!  Right.  Good.  What are you chewing on?  Oh, you're putting a salve on it?  Yo, is the Red Band up?  You should call the show.  Salve.  Year are you in?  Salve.  Whatever.  He's rubbing something on him.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy.  I want to put my penis in that hole.  Dude, I want to smell her.  I want to kiss her vagina.  Vagina.  Somebody's daughter.  What?  Somebody's daughter.  Oh, stop.  She has a nice pussy, man. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, it's her ass.  Wow.  Exactly.  Would you make out with that?  I would just make out with her pussy.  I would actually talk lovingly to her.  I would suck it and go, God, you're so important to me.  I wish you were rubbing Disappear all over your head today.  Disappear.  Then again, if you're going to do that, you might as well dis an apple, too.  Oh, my God.  All right, well, they're going to come in.  Hey, cock suckers. 
[01:47:00]  They're coming in in an hour or so.  Wow.  Look at that.  Holy fuck.  There's a big cock going in her.  Oh, dude.  How fucking hot is that?  See, how do you follow that?  What?  How do you follow that?  How do you follow that?  Just lick her thighs of it.  By sucking up the cream pie that's coming in.  That's huge.  What do you think I got?  All right.  God damn, Rich.  I want my Lost Prophets CD.  Oh, fuck.  Get it for me.  The Lost Prophets guys, that's a brutal story. 
[01:47:30]  And we also got the Times Square Groper.  Oh, there's a Times Square Groper.  In studio?  We can get them in here, I'm sure.  We've talked about these guys.  You got a lot of Elmos out there in Times Square that get arrested all the time.  Just Google image, and you'll see some of these guys with their fucking head off and handcuffs.  Because they harass all the fucking tourists in Times Square.  They dress up like these characters, and they fucking pretty much rob you.  Well, they take a picture of the man with the money. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, but you don't know that.  Right.  You take a picture with them, and then they harass you like, yo, it's not free.  It's the voice you hear coming through the costume.  Oh, shit.  And they get money off you, and the cops arrest these guys all the time.  That's our buddy arresting him.  Yeah, you know that guy, right?  Goddamn police.  Oh, yeah.  He's a great guy.  Love him.  And now we've got Super Mario being arrested.  Times Square performer dressed as Super Mario arrested after allegedly groping women.  Or a woman. 
[01:48:30]  Damon Torres, 34, is one of three or so Marios who work the crossroads of the world,  earning their keep by posing for pictures.  About 5 p.m., Torres apparently took his enthusiasm too far, grabbing the thigh of a 58-year-old.  Why?  As she walked past four Times Square, better known as the Khan Nast building on West 42nd Street.  Who cares?  He walked up to her, touched her private parts. 
[01:49:00]  Ooh.  Times Square, a line security guard.  She said she had similar encounters with the character.  She said she was offended.  Similar fucking encounters.  How many times is she going to let the Mario guy fucking touch her?  He grabbed her tits while she jumped over a barrel.  Get it.  Get it.  Arrested a few minutes later, charged with forcible touching and unlawful possession of marriage  of one.  Oh, boy.  They love their drugs. 
[01:49:30]  Jesus.  Hold on.  Cut back.  The fuck was that?  Wait.  Hold on.  Oh, boy.  Ants out.  Ants out.  I'm tapping.  Ants out.  I'm tapping.  I'm tapping.  I'm tapping.  Jaden getting it from a black guy.  Oh, I like Raven Moore right now.  She's a good girl.  That's her job.  She doesn't play games.  Fuck that.  God damn.  Why is it exclusively black dick in this chick?  Wow.  She's hot.  Ants out.  Look at her loving it like that.  It's too big.  Just enjoy the dirtiness of it.  No.  Fuck that.  She's worshiping the black people. 
[01:50:00]  You know what?  Keep her out of here.  She's a good girl.  I don't need that.  She said sex with who, kid?  Oh, my God.  Oh, you know.  I hope so.  Jesus Christ.  You know, it's okay.  Old entitlement pussy.  Show me the goddamn Ian Watkins sex pill.  Those are probably hot.  There she is.  What is with this black shit?  I don't like this.  It's the only black dick in this chick.  Well, why don't you ask her about it?  I'm gonna.  It's okay to write us together, but that's where you draw the fucking line.  I'm gonna spray paint my fucking dick brown when she comes in here.  First question, what is up with this black shit? 
[01:50:30]  What's up with this black shit?  That'll be our opening question.  Yes.  Spray it with that stuff you do for your hair, that spray.  I don't do it with spray for my hair.  Look, I'm gray.  Cotton candy in a fucking spray can.  Right?  That shit.  Who does that?  That's so stupid.  Oh, God.  Remember that guy from AAF?  Oh.  When it was raining that day?  Oh, my God.  It was just black streaming down his face.  It was fantastic.  Yeah.  He kind of sweated black.  Oh, it's terrible.  Why does that kind of upset a person?  Because you're jealous of her. 
[01:51:00]  Why?  It's a girl with a black dick in her mouth.  He's saying that you want to suck black dick, Rich.  I get it.  And then you want to rub it on your lips and go...  Look at the size of that.  Jesus Christ.  Wow.  I guarantee he can't be...  You can't be funny with that much fucking...  You don't need to be funny.  It's the word you're looking for.  Jesus.  This is...  Oh, man.  I used to not like interracial porn, but then I just kind of got into the dirtiness of it,  and it just can turn me on.  I like the goddamn Ian Watkins sex pictures. 
[01:51:30]  Who is this?  He's my favorite singer and my friend, and he was trying to hook up with my girl.  Oh, yeah?  Lost Prophets singer?  Yeah.  Goddamn.  Trying to get my girl to cheat on me.  We got to get the story.  Exactly.  What's wrong?  He's my friend, but he betrayed me.  Travis, do we know Lost Prophets?  Yes.  They had...  What song do we know?  I can play you.  Give me their biggest hit. 
[01:52:00]  Siffly black cock.  What the fuck?  Here's a story that Uncle Paul's referencing.  Why is he doing that?  You try to meet someone, and he tries to steal her away.  Lead singer of this song is in deep shit.  Uh-oh.  Is he in the bathroom here at Sirius X?  I'm selling it right now.  He's in trouble for stealing somebody's best girl.  Oh, what happened?  Uh-oh.  I got a voice like an angel.  He's very sensitive.  Yeah.  What did he do?  I'm trying to figure out if I know the song first. 
[01:52:30]  You'll know when it kicks on.  Yeah?  Will we say...  Say...  Trying to get my girl pregnant.  She's mine.  Jesus.  All right.  I know the song.  Well, this guy singing this song from the Lost Prophets.  The headline is basically saying,  And singer detained on really bad child porn charges.  Uh-oh.  No.  Aren't they all bad?  But...  Uh-oh. 
[01:53:00]  What do you do?  They're saying this one's really bad.  What do you do?  In what could be the most disgusting music story you'll read in the final days of 2012,  Lost Prophets singer Ian Watkins is accused of a crime so deviant it makes Gary Glitter look  like a model citizen.  I doubt that, but okay.  According to Sky News, Watkins was remanded in custody?  What's remanded mean?  Held in England.  Why don't they just say held?  It's British.  All right.  For conspiring to...  It's like barter. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, my God.  I was just like...  His eyes bugged out as he's looking at the paper.  Conspiring to steal somebody's girlfriend.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  God damn him.  Let's hear the facts first, Uncle Paul.  I love her.  Wow.  For conspiring to rape a one-year-old girl.  All right.  Stop.  Come on.  Another myriad, as well as a myriad of child pornography charges.  Did they leave a number out of that?  I never should have introduced those two.  Oh, Jesus.  Uncle Paul.  Now it's just ugly. 
[01:54:00]  The singer of the British New Metal Group was also accused of two incidents of conspiring  to engage in sexual touching with two young children, possessing, making, and distributing  indecent images, possessing extreme animal pornography.  What's extreme?  What's extreme animal pornography?  It's when they're doing X Games sports.  It's what those pictures were a few minutes ago.  That's like serious.  Two women ages 20 and 24 were also charged along with Watkins. 
[01:54:30]  What did the filthy women do?  They were trying to get my girl.  Jesus, Uncle Paul.  A one-year-old, really?  Yeah.  What, do you think?  That's pushing it for the age?  They're still good by that age.  They're still good.  You're despicable.  Fuck.  A terrible person.  That's not even child porn.  That's beyond that.  No, that's beyond it.  You're right.  There's no...  It's not...  Fucking just fucking shooting the head. 
[01:55:00]  There's no...  I know, really.  Sexuality there whatsoever.  This is just awful.  What kind of loyalty is that?  You bring them to a party, you send them pictures.  Next thing you know, those two are texting.  No texting going on there.  Sure.  It's just horrible.  I said, hey, who are you sending pictures of your little footprint to?  That's all they have.  Oh, God.  That isn't even...  Yeah, there's nothing there to... 
[01:55:30]  Like, it's...  Just fucking...  A one-year-old throws up on baby food.  Can you imagine?  Yeah.  Yeah, you always gotta...  Fucking disgusting.  God, what's he doing?  You never want to wear your good shoes.  Even Uncle Paul's getting fucking disgusting.  No.  You always gotta aim him the other way.  And make sure you don't put your good shoes on.  All right.  That's fucking awful.  They throw up on your hush puppies.  God damn it.  On your orthopedics. 
[01:56:00]  Sure.  Uncle Paul.  Great.  That's terrible.  Wow.  Just fucking shoot him.  You kill him, piece of shit.  Just kill him.  Yes.  Just kill him.  Fuck it.  He doesn't need to be on this earth.  No.  Slice his fucking throat and let him bleed out.  Yeah, that's just fucking horrible.  I mean, the way you're saying it's wrong, you're almost saying, I could see five and six.  I mean, the whole fucking thing, you know, one-year-old is just a killing point. 
[01:56:30]  Well, I got in a little bit of a jam up on Twitter recently for saying that Michaela Maroney, the Olympian, the vaulter, she'd just turned 17.  And I made a virginity hymen joke about her.  Uh, and all of those, her fans came out and just, like, were bashing me, calling me a pedo.  It's like, what?  No, 17.  Totally legal.  And joke, it was a joke. 
[01:57:00]  I'd fuck her in the ass.  No, it wasn't a joke.  I would absolutely have sex with Michaela Maroney.  But look at all the new fan base you got.  Yeah, exactly.  I still get these fucking yentas.  They tweet me, you're disgusting.  And I'm like, like, look at the conversation I see, and it's fucking shit from two weeks ago.  Get over it.  I'm on gun control now.  Why, well, why do they have to be Jew broads I think you're disgusting?  Fucking Jew broads.  I think everybody thinks you're disgusting.  Help me out, Henry.  I'm trying to fuck this gymnast.  I'm trying to bang this broad. 
[01:57:30]  Fucking a child protesting against Italians.  That's fucking, it's, you hear these stories, and how are you not just like, hey.  God damn, she has a good pussy, this Jaden.  Do they have the death penalty over there?  Wow, no.  Not at all?  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  Jolly old England.  When he goes to jail, they'll kill him.  But I hate when he goes to jail.  No, you like to think that shit.  We were just talking about it yesterday.  That doesn't happen as much as you think.  First of all, I hate anybody.  I bet they won't give him milk with his teeth.  Look, anybody on fucking Yahoo or Post, hey, when he goes to jail, Bubba will get all, 
[01:58:00]  enough with the fucking Bubba.  Enough with Bubba, right?  It's not Bubba.  It's Racheem.  It's fucking Kabooby.  All right?  Kabooby.  It's not Bubba.  No, no more Bubba.  There's no Bubbas.  All right?  Enough with your Bubba lines.  Hopefully they look like the fucking, what's her name there, taking miles of black cock.  Is there one picture of her sucking a white dick?  Dude, it hurts.  For the love of Christ.  Fucking vagina is fucking, um, look at this.  I would lose myself in that fat pussy and ass.  Yeah, well, after what she's had in there, you would lose yourself. 
[01:58:30]  She's fucking terrible.  We got the Jadens coming in, or just one Jaden?  What is it?  Two of them.  Jaden Cross.  We got the Jadens coming in, and the Joe Rogan camp is not happy with the Jadens.  So we got to bring that up.  We'll bring that up.  We'll bring up the black cock.  Black cock.

[02:01:00]  All over your bottom.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel on Sirius XM.  Welcome back to the finals of America's Got Genitals.  Genitals.  We've got four contestants left.  And you at home will decide which genitals are America's genitals.  Our judges are here.  Rich Voss.  What should the people at home be looking for in a penis?  You take a nice one about this big white cut. 
[02:01:30]  It's got to be cut.  You don't want it to look like a fucking horrible brown turtleneck.  Okay?  All right.  Let's take a look at Travis.  Judges, what are your final thoughts on the genitals?  I'm not sure what that was.  My vote is no.  Look at that.  That looks like a missile.  Nobody likes a ball like that.  It's like a grown man's penis with a young boy's balls.  All right.  Eric is our second finalist.  Eric, why don't you come out here and present your genitals?  You are truly amazing. 
[02:02:00]  I have to admit, you are making me a fan.  Oh, my God.  It's amazing.  It's amazing.  No, you don't think that's a nice peanut.  Look at the head.  Look at that.  It's perfect.  The shape and everything, the balls, the contrast.  It's a good presentation.  All right.  Let's keep it moving.  Danny is our third finalist.  Danny, show us what you got.  I'm very confused by you. 
[02:02:30]  Look, I had a lot of hope for you, and all I saw is a guy with his pants off and a rather  small package by Frank.  See, that one isn't great because the balls are too tight.  Just an opinion.  And let's bring out our last finalist.  Let's give it up for Kenny.  My boyfriend, absolute perfection.  I am giving you a big yes.  Now, that's a perfect penis.  You know what it is?  Look at the big balls behind it, you know, and the head, like there's a little ridge, 
[02:03:00]  so it's, you know, you'll, when you come down it, you'll hit your, you know, like you'll  know you hit the head.  You know what I mean?  It's fucking, that's a good one.  Okay, the judges have spoken.  We'll find out what America thought after this, when America's Got Genitals continues.  I'm not, I'm not gay. 
[02:03:30]  All right, Laszlo, take, take a mic, man.  We got to get into this.  Our good friend, Laszlo.  Yeah.  Laszlo.  He shaved all his hair off.  He's had long hair for, I don't know, I've known you for at least 10 years.  You look better now, honestly.  It looks good.  It looks good.  And he shaved it, I mean, your hair was down to your shoulders easy.  No, yeah.  Laszlo was the...  Halfway down your back and you shaved your whole fucking head. 
[02:04:00]  Laszlo was the epitome of surfer guy.  Surfer dude.  The long hair, fucking surfer guy attitude.  The whole thing.  Just travel around, free spirit.  Now, what made you, you didn't only get a haircut, you shaved all your fucking hair off.  What was that about?  Twice in my life I've shaved my head when I had really long...  Yeah.  And the last time was when I caught my fiance fucking another dude.  And you didn't watch?  I had a complete fucking... 
[02:04:30]  Oh, man.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, when?  That was, it was like at the end of college.  Did you walk in on it and shit?  Wait, you had a fiance?  You had a fiance?  At the end of college?  Dude, I was...  That's young.  I felt like an idiot.  I was engaged at 20.  Oh, my God.  And she was fucking some guy?  Yeah.  How'd you catch her?  How'd you catch her, please?  Because we were...  I was stoned.  And I saw...  She said...  We were at this club.  And she's like, let's bring some of my new friends home.  Oh, my God.  And so we came back to the house.  And we're getting high. 
[02:05:00]  And I started watching body language.  And they left.  And she's like, why are you so mean to him?  And I was like, you think I'm fucking stupid, don't you?  And she's like, you're stoned.  And I'm like, I see very fucking clearly.  She's like, you know, maybe you should move out for a little bit while we think about this.  While I fuck this guy.  So I went back to my...  Luckily, I still had my apartment.  Uh-huh.  And though I was basically living there.  Did you walk out with her and the guy still there?  No, no, no.  So I...  No, they had left after, you know, we'd partied and stuff.  So then, two days later, I come over to the house. 
[02:05:30]  I knock on the door.  I'm knocking, I'm knocking, I'm knocking.  By the way, his truck is in the driveway.  Oh, my God.  She comes to the door so freshly fucked.  Like, flushed in the face.  Oh, no.  I've never seen that.  What'd she say?  This is terrible.  It was over.  Look in the mirror.  Did she admit it?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, it was...  She was half-dressed.  It was fucking...  It was, you know, 11 or midnight.  What did she say when you were there?  She, what the fuck are you doing here?  What the fuck am I doing here? 
[02:06:00]  Did you confront him?  No.  Oh, no.  So she tries to make it your problem.  And...  Yeah, and...  Isn't that wonderful?  Oh, my gosh.  So...  And then, two weeks later, I walked into a radio station and said,  do you need any help?  Ah.  And that's how your career started.  And that's how I got it, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Now, obviously, looking back, it's one of the best things that ever happened to you.  Best thing that ever happened to me.  You probably wouldn't have went into radio if she didn't fuck that guy.  That fucking humor!  You could have still walked into a radio station.  You don't miss her or anything, do you?  Yeah.  You know, that's bullshit.  My priorities were her, like,  we're gonna get married, we're gonna do this, we're gonna have a house on. 
[02:06:30]  Ooh.  God.  So what?  You had a meltdown, though?  You don't pine?  Yeah, I had a fucking complete meltdown.  And you shaved your head.  I did drugs for two weeks and shaved my head and burned her pictures in a pile, the whole bullshit.  Can't they fucking stick it in and break it off on you like that, those fucking bitches?  Did you ever see her again?  A couple times.  You know what ever happened to her?  No.  Did she get fat?  I thought about tracking her down, just so I could go, ha ha!  Hey!  Bitch!  Let's do that. 
[02:07:00]  What's her Facebook?  I don't know.  I'm not on Facebook.  You don't care anymore.  You're not on Facebook?  No.  Oh my God.  You don't care?  So that's the last time you shaved your head.  And now you shaved your head because you are a Long Beach resident there on Long Island  that got fucking destroyed by Hurricane Sandy or Superstorm Sandy, whatever the fuck.  I can't communicate to you how fucked our town was.  It's like we live on a barrier island off of Long Island.  It's a strip of land.  It's the little strip that is on the south shore of Long Island that pretty much keeps 
[02:07:30]  the ocean from hitting Long Island.  You're pretty much going to have waterfront back of the house and the front of the house  at the same time.  Yeah.  It's a very thin island.  The entire island was underwater.  Yeah.  Wow.  How much water?  There was cars floating at the end of my block.  Wow.  And what fucked us is last year they made such a huge deal about Irene.  So we evacuated. 
[02:08:00]  Good night, Irene.  A little song from a little motion picture.  And we evacuated.  And this time they were like, oh, there's going to be a storm surge.  Like, what is that?  And we quickly found out.  We didn't evacuate.  And I'm in my house.  Someone did in the bathroom here this morning.  And it's like 100 mile hour winds.  My neighbor's roof starts coming apart and pieces are flying and smashing into my house.  And, you know, I've got all those solar panels on my roof.  Yep.  And some of them are up on stilts. 
[02:08:30]  And I swear, dude, the whole roof felt like it was coming off.  It felt like it vibrating and shit.  And then the fucking power went out.  And it's just black as fuck.  And then all of a sudden, outside, I hear this blood-curdling scream.  And I run outside.  And there's waves coming down the street.  And I'm like...  Holy shit.  I'm like, we are fucked.  Were you thinking you might not make it?  Dude.  Absolutely.  Just going outside was risky because there was so much debris.  Of course.  There was a tree broken half and was floating down my street.  A full fucking huge tree. 
[02:09:00]  Not just a branch.  Not an enormous tree, but a tree that broke in half.  Not an E-rock twig.  How much did you lose?  We fortunately didn't lose as much as it was.  You were one of the lucky ones.  Yeah, we were really lucky because we were in a higher area of Long Beach.  Right.  You lost your basement, right?  Obviously you did.  Fortunately, we bought a house without a basement.  Okay.  Yeah.  A lot of slabs over there.  And what was really fucked up is when you open the front door and the entire house is  surrounded by ocean and it's pitch black outside and all the fucking cell phones, like no signal 
[02:09:30]  or anything, you're like, this is bad.  Yeah.  This is fucking bad.  You're on your own, motherfucker.  And two blocks away, these houses started catching fire.  So my next door neighbor is in a wetsuit helping the firemen because they can't find the hydrant  and then our electrical plant, which is not that far away, water breached it and the whole 
[02:10:00]  thing exploded.  It was like a fire where you just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Yeah, that shit doesn't mix well with salt water.  No.  The other thing that I realized that is, I learned a lot through this apocalypse, by the  way, and that is don't have your cars in your garage.  If you're going to get flooded because your house will fucking burn down.  So many cars caught fire.  Oh, yeah.  They shored out.  They shored out.  Oh, really?  From water?  And start on fire and then they burn down the house because it's in the garage.  But if you don't have them, either way, you're going to lose them because you're going to 
[02:10:30]  lose your car anyway.  He's talking about losing the house, though.  What's that?  He's talking about losing the house.  No, I know, but you're going to lose your car.  Oh, the car will start to fire.  Yeah, the car catches fire.  All right.  I didn't get that.  30 seconds.  All right.  Relax.  I just thought he was talking about one of his video games.  Yeah, you should have used God mode.  Just cheat code.  God mode.  Unlimited ammo.  So what was the first thing you did?  The first thing I did, well, my studio is on the ground floor and that's where GTA 3,  Vice City, San Andreas, all those masters, like the full recordings with Axl Rose and 
[02:11:00]  everything.  I mean, all this stuff.  Valuable stuff.  And I just bring them back to do it again.  I started freaking out and grabbing just boxes of masters and putting it up on the second  floor because I was like, I'm not going to let this stuff get ruined.  Is there another place you could store them too?  I've learned a lot of lessons and that's don't keep a lot of amazing masters from some  epic video games just on the ground floor near a sandbar.  And the storm hit around 7 or 8, right?  So the storm.  Walk us through the night because like how the fuck? 
[02:11:30]  At 6 o'clock, our street was dry.  Right.  And I was like, we are so going to be okay.  Right.  You know?  And so I'm hitting on my chick.  I'm like, let's have some hurricane sex.  You know, the whole fucking house is shaking.  I figure if the house gets ripped off, you know, if the roof disappears, it'll be like  a very Ghostbusters moment.  But when the power goes out and I was like, okay, we can deal with power out.  And even then the whole house felt like it was going to shake apart.  Right. 
[02:12:00]  Heard the blood curling scream outside, saw the water coming down the street.  And then it's like, just move everything to the second floor.  My neighbor parked his car in my driveway, like right up against my house to try to get  it away from the water, which...  And like you said, you guys are a little higher up.  Yeah.  But as soon as the ocean came up to the house and got in his car, all the lights went on.  Everything's blinking inside.  Oh, man.  So I put on like fishing waders from salmon fishing in Alaska, and I'm wading down the 
[02:12:30]  street.  I'm knocking on his door.  I'm like, you got to get your fucking car.  It's going to catch on fire.  No shit.  So...  Doesn't the water put them out?  Like if the water shorts it out, it has to, I guess...  No.  The water has to pretty much cover the hole.  Anything above the water line is burning.  This happened October 29th.  There were still burnt out cars all over Long Beach a week ago.  And now you have the military there, right?  Hold on.  How many cars were burned out, would you say?  Hundreds?  At least 50, I would say.  Man.  But so... 
[02:13:00]  High Tide was at 844.  Right.  And it's in my garage.  There's shit floating in my garage.  And it came right up to the...  Came up right to the bottom of my front door.  I'm like, here it goes.  And then it started to recede.  I was like, oh my God.  Wow.  Still a lot of damage.  The roof is fucked.  But most people had feet of water in their main living area.  And every house in Long Beach still has piles of shit out front.  Just sheetrock.  And so the next morning, we wake up. 
[02:13:30]  There's no cell phones.  Wait.  You were able to sleep?  Well, I drank a bottle of whiskey and listened to 1010 Winds.  So you kind of passed out is what it was.  Yeah.  For a couple hours.  So I woke up the next morning.  And you start walking around town.  And it literally is like an apocalypse has happened.  Because every plant starts wilting.  Yeah.  The entire town is brown now.  Because saltwater...  Right, right.  Kills everything.  Got in every tree, shrub, flower.  So the entire outside of your house just starts wilting the next day. 
[02:14:00]  Holy shit.  You're literally watching everything die.  And there's just cars in the middle of the street.  And people out in the street crying.  And it was...  Dude, it was a horror show.  And then...  So rumors start spreading.  Oh.  There's looters.  Oh.  And there were looters while there was still...  While it was still flooding, there was looters hitting the pharmacies for that Aussie and Percocet.  But it wasn't rumor?  They really were?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:14:30]  Fuck.  That's the first place they were hit.  Yeah, it's the first place they got hit.  And so there was all these rumors about those gangs coming down from Hempstead.  And the National Guard's going to come and throw us all out.  So people start getting in the streets.  Like, nobody's fucking throwing me out of my house, you know.  I stuck it out here and I'm not leaving now.  There's no water.  You can't flush your toilet.  There's no electricity.  There's no cell phone.  So it took us days to get word to our family that we weren't dead.  Yeah, I was...  I had texted you a couple of times and no response.  I'm like, all right, Laszlo's dead.  That's just nice. 
[02:15:00]  What happened?  Yeah.  And they had to drive up from the South Shore, Long Island until you got a signal.  And then you, like, updated people on what was going on with you.  Yeah.  So 48 hours later, there's armored vehicles and guys with machine guns walking down the street.  I was like, this shit is real.  Yeah.  No shit.  This shit is real.  To get where you live, do you have to go over and over pass?  Well, fortunately, this is the thing that saved us from looting.  There's only three bridges to get onto Long Island.  So unless looters are coming over in a boat. 
[02:15:30]  The Lloyd.  Right.  Could you guys not get over?  Well, there was police checkpoints.  Well, I know what you said.  The Lloyd.  No.  Oh, my God.  I would have went with Jeff or Bo.  Oh, man.  I could have went with Dental.  What else about your experience?  The other thing, well, here's the things I learned.  First off, having a wood-burning stove saved our lives because we were able to heat your house. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  And, you know, we've become so accustomed just flipping a switch and your house is heated.  Oh, that's how I felt when I hooked the generator up to make sure my radiant floor heat was on.  Yeah.  I felt like I was in the Stone Age.  But getting gasoline was a fucking issue.  Yes, especially, you know, it was hard for everybody.  But you guys, you couldn't even get off the fucking island to go to get gasoline.  Well, most people lost their cars.  Yeah.  So there's no way.  How do you go anywhere?  Yeah.  So you're stuck there in this place.  You don't want to leave your house. 
[02:16:30]  You know, what, are you going to go live in a high school in the middle of Long Island in a gymnasium?  Wow.  But the wood-burning stove saved our asses, you know, because we always get like four cords of wood for the winter.  And that's how we heat our house.  How did it not float away?  Okay, so say you're staying on the second floor, right?  Yeah.  But within three days, mildew is accumulating throughout the whole fucking house.  That was the least of their problems.  Yeah.  You're not thinking about mildew at that point.  That's the least of their problems.  Exactly.  You mean mold?  Mold and mildew.  Yeah, same thing. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, that's...  Mildew.  Well, mold.  What?  Well, sorry.  Mildew, whatever I tell it.  There were fucking cars exploding.  I mean, there were houses fucking floating by in the last six months, and he was worried  about mildew.  Voss is like, didn't he get dishpan hands?  Jesus.  That's magic.  That was the bathroom scum.  I wasn't really worried about it.  Yeah, that would be the bottom of things that he was worried about.  Don't worry about your wrought iron rusting.  Oh, my God.  Did your dishes have spots on him? 
[02:17:30]  Mildew?  Shut up, you idiots.  Listen to me.  He was trying to save his possessions.  When our house...  Mildew.  When our house burned down.  When your wife burnt your house down, what?  No, my wife did not burn the house down.  What do you think?  Jewish Lightning burnt your house down.  Oh, what do you think?  They're going to fucking take this tape to court and say...  Exactly.  We're making fun of this, stupid.  Oh, I'm not so...  Did he take your fucking AIDS thing off my table?  What is he doing?  He's got bloody band-aids.  What are you doing?  Bloody band-aids.  Oh, really?  His house burned down.  That's the least of your problems.  Well, Laszlo, what about the mildew? 
[02:18:00]  Yeah, I wasn't so concerned about the mildew.  Okay, see, there you go, Rich.  That's all you need to know.  What's wrong with your fucking leg?  What about the mildew?  The other thing in an apocalypse situation where you can't go anywhere is all you do  is get fucked up.  Is that all there is to do?  Because people are like, the world has ended.  Let's get high.  Let's get high.  Yeah.  And I just bought a pig from a farm up in Massachusetts that was slaughtered.  E-Rock.  It was all kinds of...  Yes, E-Rock is very tasty.  So an entire freezer full of pork. 
[02:18:30]  And so we had massive barbecues for days.  Yeah.  How long did it last before it started to go bad?  None of it went bad.  We cooked it all and gave it away.  Yeah.  That's pretty good.  Just fed people.  The grocery stores just...  Gone.  Yeah.  Just barbecued stuff out front and gave it away.  Oh, they did?  Yeah.  So the people were actually...  No one was going hungry.  And what were you doing?  Oh, no.  So you had water supplies and...  Yeah, that's the other thing is...  So fill up the gas tanks of the cars.  And if they go bad, you know, this whole idea that you can siphon gas out of cars, you can't 
[02:19:00]  fucking do that anymore.  Not anymore.  They threw that out a while ago.  They got those fucking things in there that you can't put a hose in.  There's people...  There's one guy who's like, I'm going to drill a hole in my gas tank to get the gas out  from my generator.  That's smart.  Yeah, that's going to go over real fucking well, dude.  People start thinking of that shit, though.  Yeah.  You know, we had a couple of huge sort of six-gallon bottles of water that we always have just in  case of some kind of shit.  And also...  God, you're prepared.  Yeah.  Well, dude, I'm from the Midwest.  Yeah.  I'm from the land where tornadoes just wipe your fucking house out. 
[02:19:30]  The other thing was, after Y2K, remember all that shit?  We were like, your tubes aren't going to work.  We shoved a thousand bucks in small bills in our safe.  And that...  That's smarter than where I put them.  I just rolled them up.  Because...  I'm in hindsight.  Dude, there were so many people that were fucked because we've become so fucking lazy  with credit cards and ATMs and debit swipes.  It's like, when there's no electricity for weeks and you need to buy stuff, cash is fucking king. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, yeah.  So you're able to get pretty much what you need, right?  Yeah, we made it through, so...  While we depend on electricity, eventually with solar power and stuff, we'll have these  backups that just can't get...  The sun doesn't, you know...  Wow.  Scientist Jimmy, thank you.  This is true.  Yeah.  I know what I'm talking about.  Do you?  Yeah.  Let's ask you about mildew.  Mildew.  The water that pours down, mold will grow within two days.  Yeah, but when you're in the middle of an apocalypse, you don't care about mildew. 
[02:20:30]  That's my point.  When you're breathing mold like that, black mold...  Dude, I have a metal rod still stuck through my fucking roof.  Right.  I'm not worried about mold.  He doesn't want to hear about black mold yet.  I can't get a goddamn...  Eventually, he'll figure out the black mold problem.  Get rid of your sheetrock.  I can't get a fucking...  Anybody to come repair shit down there.  Most people...  A lot of people haven't come back because you can't get a boiler...  You know, until February for water heaters.  What's going to happen to your neighborhood eventually?  I don't know, but it is a fucking mess. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  Just piles of shit.  Can you at least drive around?  Yeah, you can drive around.  They removed most of that stuff?  Yeah.  And it was nice having the police blockades at all the bridges because...  Yeah, yeah.  Keeping the riffraff out.  Kept the fucking riffraff out.  But dude...  How's the beach look?  I know that's like...  Dude, it is fucked.  Really?  Yeah, the beach.  Is the sand just gone and all that?  There was couches out on the beach that washed out of people's houses.  Wow.  No, that was from Puerto Ricans last year.  Oh, God.  That's kind of funny. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, in 1987.  I wish we could play more Billy Crystal at this point.  Oh, shit.  But the other fucking issue now is dealing with insurance companies, dude.  What a cock...  Tell me about it.  Let's go.  Let's do this.  Yeah.  We all know they're cocksuckers.  Oh, those insurance companies?  They could have all those cute commercials all they want on TV, but they're a bunch of cocksuckers.  They're pigs.  Thousands of dollars.  Every single one of them.  We spend on insurance.  Sure.  And then when you need them...  And when you need it...  They'll figure out how they're not going to help you out. 
[02:22:00]  My neighbor, he kept telling Allstate, you know, you need to fucking pay me for my car.  It's fucked.  It's flooded out.  He sent them the title, and they came to tow it, and they're like, we can't find it.  And he's like, well, the city towed it because you took too long.  Oh, shit.  Because you can't just leave cars sitting out in the middle of the fucking street.  Allstate, so the city came and towed it somewhere, and so Allstate, so that's not our problem.  That's now a stolen vehicle, so you have to go file a police report.  Oh, my God.  He's like, would you please get fucked?  He's like, who's going to steal a fucking car that had the ocean in it?  There's one way, and again, this is where people think the threat of gun violence. 
[02:22:30]  If they had that threat, if these insurance companies knew that by stealing from people,  they were going to be dragged out into the street and killed, they wouldn't steal from people.  And right on cue, a progressive commercial on TV.  Oh, yeah.  They're all fucking pigs.  That's why they've got so much money to advertise.  So we go through all this shit, and I'm pointing stuff around the house.  That's ruined.  That's ruined.  And they're like, oh, we don't cover that.  Your other policy covers that.  So you talk to the people for the other policy, and what's weird is all these rednecks come 
[02:23:00]  up from Florida and Texas.  Right.  They're the ones that have to be adjusters.  And they come up, and they're like, well, y'all beach community show is fucked up.  And she just walks around your house, we ain't covering that.  We ain't covering that.  I'm just like, why wouldn't they cover certain things?  Because it's too expensive.  Well, I paid my fucking premiums, you cocksucker.  They don't want to fucking cover anything in the end.  So they finally sent us a check.  Greatest scam ever.  I mean, we literally got a check like two days ago.  How much?  Hold on.  Before you say.  How much was the estimated damage in your head? 
[02:23:30]  How much do you think that damage your house had?  50 grand?  And what was the check for?  That's why I said it.  It was maybe two thirds of that.  Not so bad.  Not so bad.  But here's the thing.  You can't just go deposit the check at the bank.  It's made out to you and the bank.  And my neighbor's like, get ready for some fucking drama.  He's like, what does this even mean?  He said, you have to go to the bank and deposit it.  And then when you want to spend it, you have to go show the bank receipts. 
[02:24:00]  Can I please have some of the money for this?  They're in cahoots with you.  They got a fucking.  Wait, wait.  Is that so you don't take the insurance money they're giving you and just do other shit with it?  Yeah.  A part of me thinks it's none of their business.  And a part of me thinks they've agreed to cover you for this.  And it's their way of not getting ripped off.  I almost understand that.  But if you lost your shit, then who gives a fuck how you spend that money?  No, but I mean, I just.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  If they give you a check for $50,000 because you lost the, you know, $80,000 worth of shit  because they never give you exactly. 
[02:24:30]  Who gives a fuck how you spend it?  I know a white trash guy down the road that he got some money and he didn't replace his  washer, dryer, or water heater.  The first thing he got was a, like, you know, an 80-inch flat screen fucking.  Yeah.  Like, you white trash motherfucker.  But that's his business.  If he wants to do that.  I don't know.  I don't, I don't, I understand at least why they do that.  It's the not covering stuff that makes them fucking just murderable.  Yeah.  So it's been, it's been drama. 
[02:25:00]  We, you know, we didn't get it as bad as most people.  We can live in the house and how many houses were destroyed?  I heard that, like, at least 10% of the houses are completely.  In your area.  Condemned.  Will FEMA cover the difference?  Why are you showing me your tattoo?  Because he wants you to bring it up.  I'm not.  I got to keep putting the lotion on.  Don't you put the lotion on the tattoo?  I do.  It does, or it says something dumb again.  When did you get that?  Huh?  A couple weeks ago.  It says something dumb.  Did you, did, did you, did you, did you, did you, did you haggle him down? 
[02:25:30]  Did you, did you haggle him down?  No, it was free.  It was on TV.  Nice use of haggle.  It was, it was free.  Well, what happened was my TV got, my TV got, my TV got, my TV got, my TV got screwed  up during my fire and I got insurance money.  So I took it and bought a tattoo because they didn't really care what I did with my money.  It was free on TV.  Yeah.  We kind of made that joke.  What, what, what television show?  Uh, uh, cover up, tattoo cover up. 
[02:26:00]  They cover the tattoo.  See, Rich, they're all casual.  Like, oh, I wasn't supposed to be.  So you sort of just, you happen to be putting lotion on my tattoo.  I'm putting lotion.  You played right into what he wanted.  You've hit that level of your career where you're going on reality TV shows to get free  stuff.  No, no, they asked me because I know people on the show.  Okay.  And shut up.  I did it.  What's the big deal?  I had one of the best tattoo artists in the country do it.  That's why I did it.  Oh, so it was kind of, could you have them tattoo an interesting story somewhere?  No, he asked me.  I know he asked me. 
[02:26:30]  So Laszlo.  It puts the lotion on the tattoo.  So then when did you shave the head?  I actually shaved the head beforehand because I was having a bit of a midlife crisis.  What happened?  You turned 40.  Turned 40.  And what does that mean?  Like you just figured.  It's time to, 40 was a weird one for me.  Throw away youthful things.  Yeah, 40 was strange.  And also because we're hunkering down on GTA 5 and I just like, you know what?  I need to do something different.  I just need, yeah, to break.  When's that coming out, by the way? 
[02:27:00]  Spring.  Spring, huh?  Spring is, I think, what we said.  Well, I can't wait.  I ain't saying anything.  But we just released, I was showing Anthony, Grand Theft Auto Vice City is now on my iPad.  That's pretty cool, man.  Ten years ago.  Dude.  That's ten years.  Ten years ago.  And now it's on this.  Well, that was a quick ten years.  Yeah.  I want to do a 40.  And you're turning 30 on a new game.  What you needed.  Hey, yeah, it looks like you're backing up there.  I would love that.  Hey, where's this car going?  Get out of my strip club.  I'm going to run this guy over. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, I want to do a voice.  Oh, you want?  Yeah, sure.  Maybe I'll work at one of the schools or something.  Careful, don't run over the toddlers.  You got a school bus driver?  Oh, yeah, that's what I'm saying.  I don't think you like it very much.  Shut up.  There's only adults in our games.  Goddamn rotten Nazi haircut.  Has anybody mistaken you for a fucking white supremacist?  No.  No?  No.  Because they're in shape.  Wow.  Did your arm hurt for throwing so many punches and not connecting? 
[02:28:00]  Wow.  That was...  What?  Are you going to stay down there or what?  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah?  Are you going to stick it out?  I think we're going to stick it.  This is one of those, you know, once in a hundred year storm.  Well, we'll see.  We'll see.  I mean, it's a tragedy.  At least you know your house will survive.  Yeah, I mean, if we made it through that...  At least the top half.  If we made it through that amount of wind, I mean... 
[02:28:30]  Four.  There was so many...  You were scared, right?  Really scared.  I was fucking bugging.  Yeah.  Did you have trees?  No.  Did you have, like, an escape plan or any of that shit?  Well, no.  It got really bad?  Once the ocean was up at the front door, there's no real escape plan.  But what do you do at that point?  Just hope?  Yeah, fortunately, you know, I knew high tide was 844, so...  You knew that would be the worst.  By the morning, it was all gone.  How do they know?  It's amazing that they know.  By the minute, too.  Fucking when high tide will be. 
[02:29:00]  They get the high tide charts.  Yeah.  Oh.  You need us if you like fishing.  Yeah.  I, um...  By the way, Danny's an asshole.  What the fuck?  Well, talk to management around here.  They'll concur.  No.  I hired him within 48 hours of him being fired from this place.  Really?  Yeah.  You are like the dumping ground for fucking Opie and Anthony's show.  Fired and quit people.  All your fodder.  Yeah, all of us.  Send him to me.  Yes.  Yeah.  You might have told... 
[02:29:30]  Go ahead, lads.  Go ahead, lads.  Just trolling that in me.  Do you remember when we were together, I guess it was in May or June?  And Danny is the worst person to tell you that somebody has passed away in the world.  Oh.  So many people have broken news to me.  Yeah.  That somebody's passed away.  And it was me, you, and Danny.  And Danny comes up, and Travis.  And Danny comes up and says, I've got some really bad news.  A good friend of ours...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  ...has passed away.  And I was like, oh, fuck.  What? 
[02:30:00]  Is it Opie?  And he's like, no.  I go, is it Jim?  No.  And then so I start going down through the level of, you know, who cares?  And I'm just naming all these people off.  And I'm like, dude, this is not the way you break bad news to people.  You don't do this.  Yes.  It's multiple choice.  It's really.  This is not...  Like, because you're going through shock with every name, waiting for it to be that one.  And he was all drunk and slurry and shit.  And I was just like, God, you're fucking awful.  Who was it?  It was Steve.  It was when he broke the news about Steve. 
[02:30:30]  Yes.  I was just like...  Wait, you...  Steve died a while ago.  Oh, he didn't tell you...  I think he just told you.  No, no, no.  No, this was a while ago, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That sucked.  Jesus Christ.  A lot.  Yeah.  It's just...  Just say...  Just say, so-and-so's dead.  Yeah, don't milk it.  Yeah, don't milk it.  It's not a news tease.  Yeah, yeah.  Coming back after this, one of your friends is dead.  I can't stand that.  Sam just told me that we were in San Diego and we came out of our separate rooms.  Oh.  Despite Sam trying to make that change. 
[02:31:00]  Oh.  See, we'll sleep on different beds like Ricky and Lucy, huh?  And, uh...  Adjoining rooms, though, so you had the door at least to...  No, no, no.  Really?  No.  I don't know.  Um...  Why?  I never understood the door in between.  So you could just go in there and go, what are you doing?  Nah, nothing, you?  All right, later.  All right, see you.  Close the door.  All right.  Hate the adjoining door.  Yeah.  That's for the kids, I guess, if you have a big family.  Sure.  Yeah, you just...  Sometimes you gotta jimmy it open.  You gotta jimmy it with a butter knife.  And you go in there and you do your business and you close it. 
[02:31:30]  I'm right there.  God damn, you're an awful human.  Hey, who was eating tapioca over the crib?  I don't know.  Wasn't me.  Wasn't me.  Get rid of that quick.  Wipe it off his leg.  Or her.  Laszlo, you seem different.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I'm a jaded soul.  Are you?  Yeah.  Come on, you're still...  You're still Laszlo, but you seem a little different. 
[02:32:00]  Well, I'm also tired because I've been flying to L.A. nearly every week.  Yeah.  For the games and stuff.  Yeah, for the game and stuff.  One airline, right?  What airline?  I mostly fly Delta just because I get upgraded all the time.  Oh, right.  So...  You platinum?  Something.  Gold.  Ooh.  Pricard.  But...  No, it was...  In all honesty, it was really depressing for just weeks to have...  I mean...  Because everybody you know, their life is fucked.  I have one more question for you.  Yeah.  What have you learned about humanity through this? 
[02:32:30]  I need to know.  Because everyone thinks that no one's going to fucking lose their minds and do crazy shit.  With...  As soon as something like this happens, people that you think are even keeled, the racism  comes out with a quickness.  Oh, that's terrible.  And the rumors...  Because you have no way...  It's so...  There's no internet.  There's no mobile phones.  No way to verify anything.  The only way that you're getting any kind of...  I even went to City Hall one day and I was like...  Tried to fight him, hurt your knuckles?  Is there a...  Sorry.  Is there a command post? 
[02:33:00]  Is there like an information office?  And they're like, no.  So the only way that you can get information is just from word of mouth.  Yeah.  So...  Oh, yeah.  Rumor becomes fact.  Oh, it becomes like there's gangs of black people.  And then...  Everywhere.  Yeah.  And it's like, oh, they're going to...  You know, they're bypassing the bridges.  They're on boats.  Oh, my goodness.  I was like, what are you talking about?  Did you...  I should have told you that was a lie right there.  Exactly.  The fucking Amistad is pulling up.  Did you have weaponry?  Did you have weaponry to protect yourself? 
[02:33:30]  I carried a knife and I had a Grand Theft Auto 3 baseball bat.  Oh, there you go.  Real life GTA.  That's great.  They fall down the ground.  Money appears around them.  You gather it up.  Yeah.  But I mean, what was...  How long would it take for your neighbors to fucking haunt you?  That's a good question.  Neighbors started getting in fights over firewood.  That was...  Within how many days?  And then two, three days?  That's it.  That's what I think.  I mean, shit breaks down fast.  Two, three days tops.  I mean, I gave firewood to people because, you know, they had kids.  They need to...  Were you scared people were going to break into your house because it was in relatively good 
[02:34:00]  shape to try to get shit?  Oh, that's the other thing we did after...  Not looters.  Just your fellow neighbors.  Well, you start looking at the house like, what do I really give a fuck about in this place?  You know what I mean?  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  You start thinking like on those terms.  Yeah.  And so we actually loaded up two cars and just looted our own home.  And everything, if we said, if this place gets completely overrun, then what do we want 
[02:34:30]  to take?  And so we took that stuff.  Did you think that way?  Yeah.  Dude, you had to.  Did you wish you had a gun at that time?  I did.  Yeah.  It would have been...  But my neighbor had a gun.  But, you know...  What if he was coming in?  Yeah.  Good point.  Yeah.  But...  Gotta watch that guy.  I mean, and there was a curfew.  You were not allowed out after dark.  And if you were, you know, there was a guy on you fast.  Yeah.  But I have to say the response was amazing.  You know, the... 
[02:35:00]  The first responders.  Well, you saw...  Yeah, you saw where your fucking tax dollars go.  Oh, where they go?  I mean, you know, they say, like, paying taxes is the price of a civilized society.  It was pretty fucking civilized.  There were guys from all over...  Making sure shit don't break down.  Dude, you see police cars from Albany and stuff, you know, going up and down your street.  You felt a strong police or government presence?  How long after the storm did you start to feel like a real presence from somebody who's...  48 hours.  Okay.  48 hours.  That was...  I mean, it was unbelievable.  That shit under control. 
[02:35:30]  Guys, you know, firefighters from hundreds of miles away knocking on your door.  Is everybody alive?  Putting these weird stickers on your door where they mark if the structure is sound.  It's so fucked up.  Yeah.  You lived through some shit.  Yeah.  It was...  Wow.  It was better than putting fucking Stars of David.  When they...  Four out of five.  Stars of David.  Four out of five.  That's a good one.  No, it's not.  Stinked.  It's not even a bad one. 
[02:36:00]  It's a fucking...  An abomination.  Stinkaroo.  Disguised as words.  You know it's bad when there's a telethon and there's, like, rock stars playing on television  and then they show footage of your neighborhood.  Oh, right, yeah.  It's, like, right down the street.  This is not good.  Yeah, yeah.  This is not good.  Yeah, that's Jerry crying on TV.  I know him.  A lot of questions going in.  How'd you feel about the mayor wanting to do the New York City Marathon?  I didn't really...  Oh.  Oh, I thought it was lame.  Yeah.  And, you know, my chick was supposed to run that marathon.  But it was like, how the fuck are you... 
[02:36:30]  How do you get to it?  Yeah.  You run.  How do you...  Yeah, precisely.  Four out of six.  Void's climbing back up.  All right.  Yeah, I mean, I thought that was pretty lame.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's...  I don't know what the fuck he was thinking.  Staten Island.  Run right through it.  People fucking...  They don't have water.  And the water!  Well, we got the Jadens standing by.  Laszlo, what's the big plug?  You're obviously sticking around, but let's get the plug out there for everybody.  Yeah, so Grand Theft Auto Vice City is out for iPad, iPods, Androids, all that, $4.99. 
[02:37:00]  iPhones.  iPhones.  Looks great, man.  You showed us.  Yeah.  Good stuff.  And then Grand Theft Auto V, spring 2013.  If all goes well, yes.  You won't have mold.  Yeah.  We're going to discuss Laszlo's black mold problem next.  Exactly.  And we're going to talk to the Jadens.  And Rich is going to be where, Rich?  The Stand? 
[02:37:30]  The Stand this weekend in Manhattan and on New Year's Eve at Poconuts in Stillwater, Pennsylvania.  Poconuts?  Yeah.  Poconuts.  Yeah.  I didn't name the place.  It's like coconuts, but only in the Poconos.  Yes.  So it's...  Poconuts.  Hey, listen.  That's one of a thousand bad comedy club names.  It's also what you name your chin.  Sirius XM.

[02:43:00]  Playing in the background  There's no way  They have the rights for that  In a porno  That's true  Right  So the music always gives away  If it's a real video  You can tell because at the end  He's robbing the house  Yeah  Exactly  He's fucking with a stocking  On his face  You can tell that  There was just a couple  That invited a black dude  Over to the camera  That's sexy  No it's not  It is  No it's not  Now would you ever fuck  Would you ever fuck one guy  Say  And tell him how hot  The other guys you fucked were  Like how much better  They were in bed  Just pull your dick out  And start jerking off Jimmy  You should it's fun

[02:44:00]  I like the way  Your white hand  Looks there as well  But I actually  Perfect  I was  I was seeing  Casually seeing this  This guy  And he asked me  I was just telling him  About this fetish  That I have for black men  And he  Something clicked in his head  And he goes  I want you to call me  That word  In bed  Oh wow  Like not even with an A  He wanted me to go  Straight up E-R  Employed  Employed  On time  Tell me I was on time  Oh my god  You were ten minutes  Early today

[02:45:00]  With me on my way home  I'm not entitled  To use that word  And it just felt  Really weird  I couldn't do it  So you just used  Other stuff  Like you're a great swimmer  You take big  You have carte blanche  You have carte blanche  You take so much black dick  How funny is that  You should be able  To use that word  Fucking in every sentence  That's what I said  Really  I do  Stop with the guilt  I do  Stop with the guilt already  Just drop it  I do  Just fuck him in your car  With your window rolled up  I say you can't get  Any less racist  Than sucking someone's dick  Right 
[02:45:30]  That's true  Come on  Jesus Christ  What a great public service  Announcement  But that  When they show all these  Things anti-racism  In schools  They should just  Pan to you saying that  Like you can't get  Any less racist  Than sucking someone's dick  One of those  One of those  Fucking NBC  Like public service  Things they do  Stop the hate  The more you know  The more you know  You can't get any  Less racist  When you're sucking cock  The more you know  I have a buddy  You know Daryl Wright  Comedian Daryl Wright  Anyways he's a black dude  And he was like 
[02:46:00]  She asked him  She's all  Is this racist  If I say this  To my black boyfriend  And he's like  Yes  And I'm like  No way  There's no way  You take that  Every night  What was it  I don't know  It was something  In Vegas  When we were in Vegas  For my birthday  And we saw  Some TV show  We just got stoned  Oh what they did  Is they used the n-word  On this TV show  This black guy  Said the n-word  And it was not bleeped  And it was like MTV2  And it threw me off  And so I had to text  I had to text my boyfriend  At the time  I'm like yo  They just used the n-word 
[02:46:30]  On TV  I thought that wasn't okay  You know maybe it's okay  Because the black guy said it  You know  I don't know  Absolutely  That usually is the case  That's absolutely it  I just didn't think  Black guys  And women that take  Black cock  Can say that  Any fucking time  They want  Don't worry about it  The first time you had  Sex with a black guy  Like what  Was it  Because I fuck black girls  I just prefer white girls  See like I'll fuck white guys  But I prefer black guys  Now what is it about it  That you like so much  Which I like hearing this  Well I mean  I guess what  I've been told by Daryl Wright 
[02:47:00]  Is like I'm not really  Supposed to say black guys  But black men  Because I guess  There's a difference  There's not  I like a guy that's got a shit together  And I could get that  With a white guy  Or a black guy  But just you know  A man that's established  That is a hustler  Do you like them  Successful  What kind of attitude  Do you like them to have  Like a Suge Knight attitude  But seriously  Or a rapper attitude  Or more of like a  Denzel Washington  Black actor attitude  No just real easy going  Kind of attitude  You know like  Cocky  Do you like sit on your phone

[03:03:00]  Jade and Cole  Came up with  Yeah we bought the domain  And we bought the  Trademark and everything  So when we moved our show  Brian's like  Look I don't care  That you're leaving  Just don't take my show name  And I'm like  Wait a minute  But then he started  Another show called  Sex Squad  And then we were like  Well  So I had to get  My attorney involved  Like hey dude  We came up with the name  We registered the domain  I own the trademark  You can't take our show  Like I'm really sorry  That it didn't work out  We're in porn  Like everything's pretty  Incorporated and trademarked  Before we let our vaginas  Out there into the open anyways  So you don't want to 
[03:03:30]  Fuck with porn people  Sometimes  The right porn people  He just  You know  It was a huge misunderstanding  And I don't think  That he realized  That we're not just  Two lame porn stars  That don't know  What we're doing  I started a show  I trademarked the name  We had the domain  There's  It's our show name  Was Brian's point  And again  I literally heard about this  To this morning  Was Brian's point  Basically that  Well our thing  We're the death squad  So the sex squad  Is kind of an offshoot  It'd be almost  It'd be like  If someone had left  Three's company  So we're doing a show  Called Two's company  Yeah he threw a fit  Because we use squad 
[03:04:00]  You know  People are going to hear squad  And automatically associate  You with death squad  So we did some research  So I did a search on iTunes  And just put squad in  And death squad was nowhere  On that list  So I showed him that  I'm like yeah  There's going to be  But did you google  Sex squad  Did I google sex squad  No but if you do  What comes up in that  I don't know what  The answer to that  I don't know either  We don't really google ourselves  We're not those types of people  If you do  Because I googled you  Oh did you  Oh yeah  What came up  There's naked pictures  No way  Man  Oh my god  Let me see  What  Wait I gotta look

[03:08:00]  Resort to a lot of  Ass eating that day  And said  Oh that's good  I did yeah  And there was another girl  There to keep me company  Ass eating is known  As the old standby  Yeah Sandy is pretty hot  Yeah Sandy's a really cool chick  Sandy's the one  That took the green stuff  And shoved it right back  In her face  And went like  Bitch  That is good  Shower  Yeah  This is your pussy  You fucking eat it  It's gross  Turnabout's fair play  I know huh  Yes a goose and a gander  So Brian  Okay so now  What happened  Because you're saying  That she's lying  And it's like  She's saying  What am I a liar about 
[03:08:30]  So what is the lie about  You know Jade and James  Is just trouble  You know  I don't even  You are trouble  I am  Talk about her  Because there's  So many people  Talk shit about this girl  And I know why  Because I mean  I had to deal with her  She's threatened to sue me  But for the most  Ridiculous shit ever  I didn't threaten to sue you honey  I just shut you up  Because you took our name  Oh yeah  You shut me up  You shut me up on a show  That you didn't  You don't even own  The only reason  I didn't do anything 
[03:09:00]  Because I don't give a fuck  For a free podcast lady  Yeah but honey  You brought a lot of traffic  To our website  And we got a lot of  Money in our pocket  When you gave  A lot of  Drovel traffic  To our websites  Clubjane.com  And janejames.com  By the way  Honey  Was I the one  That brought up Chuck  Exactly  You're saying  Just because of all this shit  That you got a lot of traffic  To your website  So that's  We did  That's why you brought up  Chuck Liddell  You took a photo  Of Chuck Liddell  Or whatever that bullshit was 
[03:09:30]  And all the other crap  That hurt  No Jim Norton  Asked about Chuck Liddell  No I only asked about that  Because I had read something  And there was a link online  That was the only reason  I asked about that  Yeah no there's no  Oh Jim you're an instigator  Yeah we're friends  You know  Or we were friends  I haven't talked to him  In a really long time  But we used to be  Really good friends  And a lot of people  Asked me about him  Because it was a big ordeal  I didn't bring it up  You know  I don't need to be  Throwing people under the bus  I never talk about  The guys that I hang out with  We don't name names  Especially for guys  That we want to  You know  Possibly see again  Exactly  You know what I mean  Don't mention my name 
[03:10:00]  Oh well  We did this radio show  In New York  With this guy  Oh my god  It was so much fun  Not going to say his name  But hoping for a fuck sesh later  Oh but he licked  He licked my pussy  And ass for hours  Just speculating  Yeah  I gave him a preview  Just don't say too much  I fucked this guy  With an average penis  And an Aussie shirt  And it was really fast and lame  Because that's pretty much  The same as saying  My fucking  We got it Jim  But Brian 
[03:10:30]  So now  Is there any  Is part of this  And again  I have no knowledge of this  Is this partly  A personality  Conflict  That kind of got out of hand  Or is there like  Legitimate legal gripes  Well  The thing that bothered me  Is that  I do a podcast network  You know  I do the  Joe Rogan podcast  And then  I also produce  About seven other podcasts  And I had an idea  For a podcast  That was going to be  Like a sex podcast  And I was going to  Originally call it  Sex  Like sex cast 
[03:11:00]  Or something  And at the time  I was really good friends  With Jaden Cole  And I was telling her  About this idea  And she had brought up  The idea of  Hey you should call it  Sex squad  Because the podcast  Network  I made  Is called  Death squad  I was like  That's a great idea  So we  Started this idea  To have a show  And originally  I was going to have  Jaden Cole  And then  James DeRom  On do it  I know  I don't care  You gotta let it finish  It's all  We gotta let it finish  For sure  And Jaden Cole  Just like  Hey I want to bring  My friend Jaden James 
[03:11:30]  On this episode  And I was like  Alright cool  And then I tried  To get Dana  On the second episode  And she's like  No I'm bringing  Jaden again  And the problem  Was the feedback  Of the show  Was horrible  Because  Because Brian Redband  Produced it  Oh damn  Did you know  Wait wait  Did you know  That there's a forum  On  Like Joe Rogan's network  That just  That blast  Fucking Redband  Like all these people  That hate him  Ari and  Teave and  Sam Tripoli  Like we're all  Yeah no  They've got a great  Thing going on 
[03:12:00]  It just wasn't  Our style  But I think  That's  I think you're  Even saying  By I could tell  By your reaction  That Brian's  Being truthful  About the way  The name of the  Show came out  It sounds like  It was a collaborative  Thing  I started Sex Squad  But I'm saying  Like  Did you hear that  He said Sex Cast  Or whatever  And she said  Sex Squad  So at least  He admitted that  Yeah of course  She said  But that was  His whole thing  Is they stole my name  We did come up  With Sex Squad  Well here's the thing  Here's the thing  When I was talking  About doing this podcast  Jaden Cole wasn't even  Supposed to be 
[03:12:30]  On this podcast  This is  When I first  Brought this all up  To Jaden Cole  She was just  A friend of mine  But that's what  Happened Brian  That's just  The way that it went  And we went with it  So you have  Nothing on us legally  We went with it  And then we didn't  Like what you were doing  So we left  Get over it  Totally  Legally  It's a free podcast  That's why I have  Nothing on you legally  Because it doesn't  Give it  I don't give a shit  But the idea is  That if  Like NBC  Creates the Cosme show  And then like  Theo decides to like  Hey leave the NBC  He's not going to 
[03:13:00]  Take the Cosme  Show to another channel  Right Brian  But you're not  The only one  That wanted to do  A sex show  Like it's not  That big of a deal  There are so many  Sex podcasts out  Like you need to  Get over it  Stop stalking us  And our shows  And our shows  That we're doing  Like get on with your life  Move on dude  Move on  It's been a year  It's time to let it go  There's enough room  In the podcast world  For all of us  Oh god  Brian  Just look up  Squad on iTunes  Please  You don't even come up  Wait listen  I don't  Just get over it dude 
[03:13:30]  Like I mean  Great  Thank you for stalking us  And tuning into the show  It's been really fabulous  But move the fuck on  The only reason I'm here  Is because fucking  A thousand people  Text me  That's why I'm here  Yeah see  They're so obsessed  With us dude  Thank you so much  And so Brian  What are you looking for  In the end  Yeah what is it  That would make you feel  What would make you happy Brian  Nothing's gonna make  Brian happy  The problem is  That I have with these girls  Is that they're fucking lying  Look at  Look at what they just did  To that  This other girl  They worked with  They threw her under the bus  I didn't work with her  Look 
[03:14:00]  Go go on YouTube  And type in  Chuck Liddell  Jaden James  And see what he has to say  About her  I mean it's  This girl just goes through  And uses people  And fucking uses their  Like  Like  And just  Like so many people  Have problems with this girl  And there's a reason  Because I had to deal  With this shit  You know  Like it wasn't their  Podcast to take  They were the host  Of a show  And then they just  Took the name  Of the show  And started somewhere else  And I was like  Alright  I don't  Whatever that is  I'm still doing the show  Without them  You know  I have  I bring Dana 
[03:14:30]  Dearman on board  And so I did that  For a few episodes  Next thing I know  I'm getting  Cease and desist  Letters from her  Friend Laura  And I'm not going  To fight something  For a free podcast  I don't give a shit  Our podcast  So now I just call  Triple X squad  A million times better  You listen to their podcast  You listen to  Dana's podcast  Night and day difference  These girls don't  Act like themselves  When they're on the podcast  They're acting like  It's a show  Dana's  It's a show  And that's why  Their show is  Nowhere in the  iTunes rankings  What are you looking up 
[03:15:00]  I only listen  I only listen  To one podcast  My wife hates me  With Rich Voss  And Bonnie McFarlane  I'll tell you  What he says  About me  I know exactly  What he says  Because he called me  And asked me  He's like  Look all these  Pictures came up  Here's the deal  Like you know  You gotta cover  Your own ass  And he says  Something about  I think he admits  That him and his  Girl had split  And then we were  In Cabo  And then he said  Something about  Oh she knew  What she was doing  Using those pictures 
[03:15:30]  Or something like that  Which was  I'm sorry  How long is it  No no no  It's okay  But Brian  About where in there  Is it  We don't want to  Play a four minute clip  It's like  If we're talking  About Chuck  We should hear  From Chuck's  Oh please  You know  I haven't seen  The video in a while  But I think  It's right in the middle  Oh okay  Who cares  I'll tell you  Exactly what he says  About me  Say it first  Because not only  Did he call me  But I also  Was in Montreal  With him  A couple weeks later  You know  It's like  You gotta  The guy has kids  You know  It's like 
[03:16:00]  He's gotta cover  His own ass  And a fiance  Yeah that's why  You guys aren't  Friends anymore right  We were friends  For a long time  Honey bunny  Yeah but you're  Not anymore  Moved on to  Bigger and better  That's true  No yeah  I mean  Shit happens  Shit happens  Is that where it is  Oh yes  I'm sorry  Okay  Can you hear  What was going on there  Because all of a sudden  I'm like wait  Engaged  This woman's putting out  This video  Suggesting that  Something's going on here  So you don't get  A rash of crap  Okay 
[03:16:30]  Over that  And especially at home  Or did you get wind  Of the fact  That that blog was up  Well I  I was broken up  At that point  Okay  And I got  I heard it was  And I talked  I talked about  Well what are you doing  You know  I mean I know her  And she's a friend of mine  But she took a picture  With me  And make it  And see me  Make it look like  And she was using it  To get press  And that's  That's just all it was  I mean  Is the conversation  That nice  When you call somebody  And go what are you doing  Or are you really mad  I was mad 
[03:17:00]  I was mad  Because I know  What it was  It was trying to get press  For you know  She's telling me  About herself  And whatever  And get press  And it was an easy way  To get press  Using money  And it was just  Red band talking about it  I know  Now we're on  Opie and Anthony's show  You know what's  Fuck off  Hold on  You know what's really sad though  Was it about  Was it about  Just getting press  I mean  No no no no  Here's what it is  And I'll be completely honest  Like I said  I met Chuck  When I was 18  Okay I was 18  Working in a strip club 
[03:17:30]  And this guy walked in  And we just became friends  And then  We went to Cabo  And I had always  This was when  MySpace was big  You guys remember  MySpace  Me and Chuck hung out  A bunch of times  You know  And I had a few pictures  Of us up  And you know  Along with all my other friends  And we went on vacation  Of course we're on vacation  We take more pictures  And I had put more pictures  From my vacation  With everyone up on MySpace  You know  Like everyone does  And this was when  My name was really coming up  And oh my god 
[03:18:00]  Chuck's with a porn star  It was no longer  Oh hey this is just  A friend of Chuck's  Who's a no-namer  It's oh my god  Wait  It's not Chick from Bing Bros  Isn't this a famous  Porn star now  And so yeah  It looks bad  But to me  Like this was just my friend  You know  I put some pictures up  Because he's my homie  And it just  But my name was coming up  And now it's like  This porn star  Looking for breasts  And yeah  He called me  Hey dude  What's with these pictures  I'm worried  And I told him  You know  It's like dude  I'm sorry  We've never had a problem  With pictures before  And I'm really sorry  That this happens  You know 
[03:18:30]  And then he told me  About this interview  But like I said  He was fighting in Montreal  Like two months later  And I flew up there with him  And we hung out  And we had a great time  And you know  Well  And we were done  But then I started dating  One of the guys  That sponsored him  So just you know  Why did you do that?  Well I mean Chuck  There's not any real  You know  We were friends  But then I started dating  This other guy  You know  You find someone new  To replace the old one  And you just  That's life right?  Yeah  Yes  I have one question  Because I don't know  A lot about this 
[03:19:00]  I love the hand raise  I don't want to cut in  Because I'm not  Like a big porn guy  Or anything  But if I see green stuff  Coming out of a girl's pussy  All right  Why would I go eat her ass?  I would only think  That's a lot worse  Well you could do  A lot of  The lesser of two evils  No no  It was  Basically what happened  With that scene  Oh yeah  Definitely  Well I made her go  Clean it up  And then  So luckily  There's another girl  Involved in the scene  But both of us  While we were in the bathroom  We were like  Okay  I'm not putting my fingers  In there  I'm definitely not licking it  So we're gonna fake it 
[03:19:30]  You know  And so we did a lot  Of her  Like sitting on her face  And having some fun with that  And any time  Like the camera  Wasn't on us  We were like  I'm not touching it  I'm not touching it  But then the camera  Would pan around  Obviously  And so I'm like  Okay well let me just  Lick her butthole  You know  From this angle  Oh man  You know it was totally  Faking it with this chick  Because we both  Didn't want to go up  In that pussy  Well I have an answer  For Rich too  It was like a fake punch  In a movie  You're licking like  From the back  You do what you gotta do  In the porn world  I mean shit happens  And stuff happens  I just saw the picture  Shit happens 
[03:20:00]  Oh it looked really good  I just saw the picture  I was like wow  If I didn't know  The back story to that  I'd actually think  That was really odd  Oh yeah  It looked really good  We just had to avoid  Her vagina  Because neither of us  Might go in there  Rich here's why  She went to the ass  Totally gross  If you're in a mall  And you're eating  In a restaurant  And the food is bad  You just go next door  Exactly  100%  Exactly  Well if there's a new girl  That comes on a set  Like and she's totally new  And she looks a little  Off  A little off  A little dumb  Like she's looking at me like 
[03:20:30]  Let's fucking tear her apart  Like she looks  She's like a wolf  Like smells blood in the pool  Like fuck that  Let's show her what's up  Brian did we represent you properly  Because we don't  We'll let you go  But we didn't want to  Not represent you guys properly  In what you're saying  Got you  We take both sides here  Brian  Totally  We're the United Nations  Oh do we represent you  Do we represent your side properly  Sure  Yeah I mean you know  To me it doesn't matter  I just  I'm so tired of these girls 
[03:21:00]  Fucking like  Using this  So many people are like  Hey man  Whatever happened to your sex squad  You know  Your show  And blah blah  Are they  And I have to  Explain this whole story  And you know  It's just  It sucks  Because there's people  That actually  Think that I have something  To do with their show now  Just let it go Brian  Just ignore them  Tell them we've all moved on  And get over it  It's been a year  Like I said  Just let it go  Tell other people  To get over it  Dude  It's not that big of a deal  It was the name of a show  Like there's plenty of sex shows  It's fine 
[03:21:30]  Let it go  Yeah that's why  You couldn't change the name  To the Jadens  Let it go dude  On the sex squad  Let it go  Let it go  Move on  We still are the Jadens  Keep on talking shit  About other porn stars too  Oh god  Is this guy still talking  Come on  Sometimes porn stars  Are worth talking shit about  Some of us  Some of them don't represent us well  And we want to establish  That there's a difference  Between the lower end  Of the business  I'm not talking about you Jaden  I have no problem with you  Really  Everyone's got a problem with me  And I like that  I just can't wait for you  I know  That's why we compliment each other 
[03:22:00]  That's why I'm here  That's why we work  You can't wait till what Brian?  You can't wait till  Jaden James fucks over Jaden Cole  That's going to be the greatest  Maybe we should  Maybe we should see some of that now  Maybe we should videotape it  Yeah  Alright  We're wrapping up soon  Brian we just wanted to make sure  That you felt represented  And you know  What you and Joe are doing  No worries Brian  We love what you  Brian got to cry nationally  He's happy  Okay  He made his point  Boo ho  Alright Brian  Thank you brother  See you guys  Merry Christmas  Happy Hanukkah 
[03:22:30]  Hope you die in a bad car crash  Holy fuck  Jesus  There's a lot of bad energy  Wow  No like come on  Are you really gonna  We're just fucking around  We're just talking shit  It's to me  Like I  Like shit happens in life  You roll the punches  And you let it go  We had  There was so much drama  Over the sex squad thing  And we never meant to screw anyone over  It wasn't a good fit with us  And we left  Sex shows exist  And we just so happen to have another one  Was there a way  And he is just  God  It's like  Let it go dude  It was a year ago  Was there a way  Because 
[03:23:00]  And again  You always want to think  Because they have  They have really manic fans  Oh yeah  In a very good way  Yeah  Definitely  Yeah  To have worked it out with them  Where you're like  Alright look  This is getting out of hand  Because you know  If you're gonna leave  You leave  But this way you don't  We tried  Their fans don't hate you  Definitely we tried  I think you should know that  Like we definitely tried  To reach out a lot  He was hard to get a hold of  And after we left  There was a couple people  On the desk on network  That were also like  Yo we can't get a hold of him either  We need to talk  I was like  No dude  I'm not having any part of this  Yeah  We weren't his only show  That were having issues 
[03:23:30]  Yeah yeah  Some of his other guys  Like they wish that he would be  We just want to like  Drop the weapon  And back away  We love it  Brian's life is centered around  Joe and his schedule  Which is fine  Yeah it's a big show  We wanted something  And everyone else on the network  Wanted something that was set  You know they wanted a schedule  So their fans knew  When they could hear them  And it wasn't  Well it's 11 o'clock this day  And then it's gonna be  At midnight this night  Like we didn't want that  And he was just unwilling  To get us in on a set schedule  Which is what we wanted  We wanted a weekly show  At a set time  So people would know 
[03:24:00]  That they had something to do  On a Tuesday  Yeah  And it wasn't working out  We've gone from  Talking about your vaginas  To intellectual property law  Isn't that amazing?  Right?  That's the story of our lives  Dude  Now it got really sexy  Yeah  Four stars with brains  We go from like  Laser hair removal  To fucking  Our lawyers  I didn't mean to bring  It was just  We had been contacted about it  And I felt like  You know  It felt obligated  Absolutely  We don't want to be  A conflict of interest  For you guys either 
[03:24:30]  You know  And we never wanted  All this drama  And so many of the  Death Squad followers  Just attacked us after that  And it wasn't about  That in them  Because we already have  A tougher skin  Being in the adult industry  Already  Like we already  Like have built in shit  To talk about us  Because we're hoarse  Right  Are you really?  I'm not saying that  Judgmentally  Technically  Well I do have  Lesbian sex  For money  By definition  We're hoarse  I would say  Only lesbian sex  For money?  Only lesbian  She only does girls  I only does girls 
[03:25:00]  I'm kind of a dyke  Are you really?  It's sexy though  A little bit  I think after all  The black cock  You can't be saved  But I think you can be  I think there's still  Hope for you  To bring you out  Have you heard  The word of God?  Oh God  You know  I've heard the word  Of the star of David  That's what I got  Oh God  Jesus  Okay  I don't fall into that  I'm a white Catholic  I'm fucked here  Yeah  I'm Mormon  I'm just baptized  Really?  I'm not  I did wear fat laces 
[03:25:30]  In the 80s  When it was just  Becoming popular  You rock laces?  I was very entrenched  In the rap community  There you go  Well it was  I guess you could see them  Tonight at  The Gentleman's Club  Headquarters  Holiday  I'm sorry  Headquarters  Headquarters  On 38th  And I believe it's 10th  Or go to  HQNewYork.com  For details  And they have their  Yes  And they have their  ToadHopNetwork.com  Is where you can hear them  On Tuesdays at 10 
[03:26:00]  And you know  I think that was just  Some porn that  Lainey brought in  For you guys  In case you were  Missing some porn  Well Rich  Rich hasn't let go of it  He's  Oh he's loving it  He's fucking taking it  Calm the fuck down  I asked Sam  Because all the  Our porn burned  In our fire  So I said to Sam  Do you have any porn here  Because we have no porn  And you know  I need something  When I'm home  Oh I wish I would have  Don't  I want to buy some  DVDs and stuff  For you guys  I don't like amateur porn  I wanted real porn  So we  You know 
[03:26:30]  He brought this in  They're not amateur porn  We're so desensitized  Though that the only  Porn that we watch  Now to get off to  Is like the really  Dirty like  Gritty  Underground stuff  Where it's like  The girl didn't even  Know she was being filmed  And it like  Has to be really nasty  How has like  Xtube and all those  Sites hurt you guys  Because it's hard  To make money in porn now  Because there's so much  Of it for free  And I paid for it  For years  Because I didn't want it  But it's like now  Fuck man  It's out there  There's too many places  How do you make money  From it  Well  What I've done is 
[03:27:00]  The last few years  I've really slowed down  With shooting for a lot  Of other companies  So there's not a whole  Lot of content out there  And what you can find  On these tube sites  You get a lot of stuff  On the tube sites  But there's nothing new  Anymore  And everything new  That I've done  Is on my own  Personal website  So I get the attention  From all these people  On these free porn sites  And then because  They want something  New and fresh  And they can't find it  Anywhere else  They have to go  To my website  And what is AVN like  Now the fucking  Porn awards  I heard every year  It's getting less and less  Yeah it's getting  Smaller and smaller  I didn't go last year 
[03:27:30]  Because it's gotten so small  And I plan on  Avoiding it again this year  It's just not worth  My time anymore  Have you been approached  To do like maybe  Like real TV  Like a reality show  With porn stuff  Yeah  Why don't you do it  We are actually  Working on something  I know they're not afraid  We just started talking about it  But we can't say yet  Because we're still  Working on a deal  With the network  How will this project  Fuck over Red Band  Shit  Well they have filmed us  In the studio  Doing our show  So I'm sure Red Band  Will want to call  The network that airs it  And cry to them about it 
[03:28:00]  But you know  It's actually  It's really fun  We got our asses cover  We got Jewish lawyers  Unfortunately you do  Yeah  It's really fun  With those pesky pants  We stay on top of it  You know we live  These sexy lives  But we also can't  Do our business  Are you a homo?  Let's get to it  I'm tired of talking  About intellectual property law  Right?  Tell us about  A writ of habeas corpus  Did you want to go back  To the black penis?  I did enjoy that  No  No  He's like  I'm the opposite of that  Blue eyes and blonde hair 
[03:28:30]  Is it weird that I like  My nipples played with?  No I know a lot of guys  Oh good  Do you like the  Pulled or just sucked on?  Gently licked  And just tippled  A lot of guys are really  Like they don't like that  Because it's like emasculating  It feels very feminine  Yeah  But I like to do that  And a lot of women  Just don't go straight  For a man's nipple  Because it's weird  I guess  I need it  But yeah  If you do that as a woman  If you go and just  Lick a man's nipple  He's like  Oh  Oh  No one does that  I like having my nipples licked  When a nipple is the head of my cock  Well we all like to do that too 
[03:29:00]  Yeah  What do you think  See Lazo what I'm saying  Is I like blowjobs  Yeah we know  We understand  I don't shoo them away  I was quite surprised  By this one's blowjob skills  Because she only does girls on camera  She's pointing at Jimmy  She only does girls on camera  So when I first saw her  Put my boyfriend's penis in her mouth  I was like  Oh  I could do that  Oh my gosh  You two are fucking amazing  Dude you know what  Jesus Christ  There is one post in porn 
[03:29:30]  Taking pictures  That we can't stand  That we can like  Skeezed out by  It's when  We're grabbing each other's boob  Like they always want a shot  Of like grabbing the boob  Cupping the boob  Into their mouth  And we're like  That's so fucking  Like newborn infant  Yeah  There's something nurturing about it  Oh man  It's so weird  It's so weird  It's very nurturing  The nipples are just weird like that  Show us how weird that is  It's a fine line between  You know  Borderline family mother  Yeah it's so weird 
[03:30:00]  It's just like sexy  Yeah  I need you to see  Yeah  Since you're fucking so much  And doing all this  Is it hard to come in real life?  No  Is it hard to really have an orgasm?  It is for me  In life in general  Really?  I know that you don't have an issue  That's an amazing question Rich  But I have a really hard time  Having orgasms  In general  Even when I'm doing it  Myself at home  It takes me a really long time 
[03:30:30]  To get there  So when I'm with a man  He needs to have patience with me  And obviously in porn  You don't get a lot of that  So if a guy can do it  Great  And it's fabulous when it happens  But sometimes it just  Doesn't happen for me  Which really sucks  Is it a turn off?  Like if I'm going down on a woman  Sometimes if she's taking a while  I'll go  Oh when are you going to come  For Pete's sake?  Is that a turn off?  A little bit  A little bit  I mean I understand  That's a good one Jimmy  I just ended a relationship  But we were together for a while  And he would be down there  For 15 minutes 
[03:31:00]  What happened?  He violated parole?  No that's the thing  She tells me not to say  That I like Jewish dudes  Because every Jewish dude  In the room thinks I'm into them  And it's like a certain  Kind of Jewish dude  Same with her  It's a certain kind of black dude  That she's into  It's got to be successful  I'll have this shit together  It's just what I'm attracted to  Everyone has their thing  That they're attracted to  You know  A certain kind of person  I like having my face sat on  Yeah that's  Is that how picky you are?  You're silly like that  It's really fun to do that  I like to sit on faces 
[03:31:30]  And have my face sat on  Oh my god  By a guy or a girl?  Yeah  Girl  I don't want a guy  To sit on my face  There's too much going on  That's not  Yeah  To drown in  My ass is very  I've been told boyish  I mean that's what I've been told  It's hairless  I'm pretty clean  Well hairless is always good  How can you hear him  Through the stall?  Do you shave it?  No I don't need to  I shave my dick  But I don't need to shave my  Shave your ass  I don't need to shave it  That's good  I was born  Yeah yeah  With a very very hairless  Hining  That's not a bad thing 
[03:32:00]  Man  Jim has a nice penis  It's okay  Do you?  Yeah  Do you have a picture?  Have you seen it?  I want to publish  I'm his penis's publicist  Not towards  I have a decent penis  But not for porn girls  I would love  No  If you have a picture  You wouldn't have to show everyone else  I would love to see it  I want to see  He fucking shows people  I'm kind of curious  He shows people in the hallways here  Does he?  Look at my cock  Everyone has pictures of their genitals  Everyone  You want to set it up nice  So that if you're going to be sexting 
[03:32:30]  I usually  Everyone needs that good picture  Yeah the good shot  You gave yourself a good shave job one day  You're like let me snap you now  Little force perspective  I always take mine with the Statue of Liberty behind me  Exactly  People are like whoa shit  Something like wow that's a big dick  Yeah  I like putting the camera like two inches from my dick  And having the Empire State Building in the background  Exactly what Jim just said about the Statue of Liberty  No but that's better  It's more search  I think there's an app for that  Is there?  If you want a picture  I used to have a cock app there  I used to have a picture

I look short guys  I want to be able to  Take my fucking pants off  And smell my pant leg  While I'm cranking my dick  Oh my god  Jesus Christ  I'm all fucking horned up  Alright everybody  On that note  See you tomorrow  And now  The Opie and Anthony show 
[03:47:30]  Continues  This is After ONA Live  Here's your host  Sam Roberts  The ladies are all here  They're saying goodbye  They're nowhere on the air  It's After Opie and Anthony Live  They're walking out  The lady's talking about  Somebody texting somebody  Laszlo's leaving  Bye everybody  I'm not lonely at all  At least I'm not wearing  A stupid hat  Did you hear what I said Travis? 
[03:48:00]  Vaz is wearing a dumb hat  It's After Opie and Anthony Live  Laszlo was right  That everybody's gone  This show has changed  See Laszlo's observation  Was that  Because he hasn't been around  In a while  Laszlo's observation was  That the show  That Anthony's racism  Is now full force  It's now at the front  Of the picture  Whereas before  It was buried deep  Under layers of  Bits like Box of Cox  And things like that  Now  Now it's full force  Now as Laszlo said  You can't do Box of Cox anymore  So what does Anthony do? 
[03:48:30]  Yell about black people  Laszlo is right  The show has changed  Laszlo was sitting there  Poor guy  Thinking that  You know  He's coming in here  And he's pouring his heart out  About what's going on  With his house  His horrible time  With the hurricane  All this stuff  He knows there's porn stars  Coming up  And he's like  I've been away for a while  But I know the Opie and Anthony show  I know I'm gonna get to see  Some titty today  That's what  I'm looking forward to  Finally  After all the pain  I've had to go through  Some titty  And maybe some vagina too 
[03:49:00]  Today  And then what happens?  We end up  Like he said  Arguing about legal shit  With them  And I felt bad for Red Band too  Cause Red Band called out  From the Joe Rogan experience  And he was talking about  The problems  That he's had  Specifically with Jaden James  And I'm sure  That he wasn't lying  He's a good guy  I know him  I'm sure that a lot of people  Do have problems with her  And I'm sure that she's  Very difficult to get along with  The problem is  You're not gonna win 
[03:49:30]  The favor of the show hosts  When there's porn stars  In the studio  When you're a dude  Who's on the phone  And there's porn stars  In the studio  Guess which side  They're taking  Every time  And you can't fault them  For it  Which side would you take  Titties  Or phone  I say titties  John  You're on after  Open Anthony Live  Sam Roberts  The greatest broadcaster  In the world  Thank you John  Hopefully we survive  After tomorrow  And you'll continue  To be the greatest  That's right  If not  Hopefully the world  Ends around 11 
[03:50:00]  So I get to have  The last show  In the history  Of the planet  That'd be perfect  At least we'll end  On a good note  Right?  Absolutely  The best note  Exactly  Hey I learned  That Jimmy Norton  Has a good looking  Cock and balls  Yeah not only  Did I not get to see  Naked women today  In the studio  But I saw  Jim Norton's  Erect penis  It was a photo of it  It wasn't live  In the studio  But Norton  Flashed his erect penis  In front of everybody's  Face to see  I'm not saying  It was a bad one  I'm just saying

[03:53:30]  In the morning  You may get to see them nude  That fact doesn't occur to you  Monty  There is no part of you  You know what  You know what  You know what  You know what occurs to you  You know what  You know what happens  When Red Band  Your buddy  Red Band is on the phone  And these chicks  Are arguing with him  All of you are going  Oh  These bitches are hateable  I hate these cunts  Blah blah blah blah blah  All of us in the studio  Are being like  Holy shit  Look at the girls  That are in here right now  And they're making  Great points too  It's kind of like 
[03:54:00]  It's kind of like  Sitting there  You know this girl's a bitch  But she still might fuck you  Exactly  Because who knows  Who knows  They're porn stars right  They fuck people  Exactly  Exactly  You gotta take the perspective  From what's going on  In here Monty  I will  I'll take that  Into perspective  Next time  Thanks Sam  Alright thanks a lot  Good best by the way  Thank you  By the way you're the greatest  Thank you  Thank you Monty  I'm glad you made time  To squeeze that in  I don't know if we have  Screener or not  But 412  You are on the air 
[03:54:30]  412  You  Hey Sam  Yeah you're on the air buddy  And I just wanted to say  That I never saw a show  Go from very sexy  To alluring  To  What a bunch of cunts  That just turned me off  Completely  It was  I was like  I was just kind of like  Taken back by it all  By  They just  That one girl  She just couldn't  Let it go  And I'm thinking  Man you're advertising 
[03:55:00]  Your pussy on the internet  And you're talking  That kind of shit  It ain't happening  But let me ask you this  What's that  You could  You could be turned off  By what these girls said  All you want  And you could be  Sitting there going  Oh I hope something  Horrible happens to them  I don't want to hear  Another word come out  Of their mouth  This is the worst  Interview I've ever heard  If you google image  Those girls  Can you still jerk off  To them  Well  Maybe one of them  Right now  The other one  Probably not 
[03:55:30]  Because  Sometimes that attitude  Just pierces you  A little too much  Give it time  You're a stronger man  Than we are  I suppose  Lady Trucker  Hey Sam  So what you're saying  Is everybody was  Thinking  Everybody in the studio  Was thinking  With their little  And not the heads  Above their shoulders  That's exactly right  Lady Trucker  Something that happens  On the Opie and Anthony show  And this is not just  When porn stars are in  This is when  Anything is going on  All thought comes  Through the penis  Of the Opie and Anthony show  No brains are ever used  But I thought that was  Obvious to everybody involved 
[03:56:00]  And that's not just  Saying for Opie and Anthony  That's Jim  And that's me  And that's E-Rock  And that's you know  Although E-Rock  Most of his thought  Comes through those  Giant balls of his  That we've talked about  Okay well you have  A good holiday  You too Lady Trucker  Let's go to  Mongo the Trucker  What's up Mongo  Is this  The Sam Roberts  It is Mongo  You're on the phone  With The Sam Roberts  Wow  Mongo the Trucker  On Twitter by the way  Oh good  You hit the nail on the head 
[03:56:30]  Your phone's starting to  Crap out  But you absolutely  Hit the nail on the head  You're laughing too hard  At their jokes  You're pretending  You're interested  In what they have to say  And why  Because they're  Hot porn stars  You know  What do you think  Could happen  Probably not gonna happen 
[03:57:00]  But  We  Sometimes we don't think  With our broadcasting heads  Here  Again  It's the dickheads  Keegan  Hey Sammy  Love the show  Thanks man  It stays like these  When I really miss Patrice  I think you would have  Just totally taken  These whores apart  You know it's amazing  There are different segments  That come up  From time to time  On the show  Since Patrice's passing  Where I know  Like I'm just sitting  There watching it happen  And I know  How much differently  Things would have gone 
[03:57:30]  If Patrice were in studio  And this year  Exactly right  Today was one of those days  Can you imagine  If Patrice were in studio  And they had said  Well if you want to see our tits  Why don't you just google us  Can you imagine  Pulling that off  With Patrice O'Neil  In the room  Google bitch  Thanks Keegan  John  Hey Sammy sweetheart  What are you doing  How you doing  How you doing  How's life  Good  Yeah  Couldn't ever possibly be better  I was just  That was real facetious 
[03:58:00]  On me  Little  What did you learn  I learned that  That cunt  From the mashup  Nicole  Jesus Christ  You have venom in you  Today John  I'm sorry  You're right  You know I've been  Working early  Early in the morning  You take it out on me  You take it out on Nicole  For the love of god  Who's safe  Nicole  Nicole  She deserves it the most  She has a really bad  Coke habit  And apparently  That prompts her  To take violent shits  In the men's room  Which is really  Unacceptable  By any stretch  I mean John  You're right  If those are the facts  That is unacceptable 
[03:58:30]  But I don't know  That to be true  I did try to get an update  If you listen to the top  Of the show  You gotta listen to the replay  Or get it on demand  Once it's out there  But  There was just  A horrendous  I mean when you want  To say shit show  In every sense of the word  Going on in the bathroom  This morning  There was  Shit  Sprayed  Not only over a toilet  It was covering the bathroom floor  And then into the stall next door  I don't know what goes on  In these men's rooms  But all over the floor 
[03:59:00]  It stunk  I couldn't go in there  I went in  Because right before the show  Opie said  You gotta see what's going on  In the bathroom  I went in there  I almost threw up  And that was  It was disgusting  Sam I went in there  I was dry heaving  And I never  What time did you go in?  I went in  Like right when the show started  Like quarter after six  Are you promising me  That it wasn't you  Getting angry at all the shots  Because we've taken  Over the year  It's your first year  With the Opie and Anthony show  We've taken a lot of shots at you  And only in my head 
[03:59:30]  I was thinking  What if Sal has finally had enough  And he's shitting all over  The bathroom floor  No no I have better ways  Of getting back  At people on time  Alright good  Because I would hate that  For that to be you  I tried to get an update  On what was going on  With the bathroom  Midway through the show  But the door was locked  I don't know what kind of  Extensive cleaning is going on  But I'm going to try to  Get some of the people  From facilities  I got to talk to somebody  About this  It was so bad  It has that like dry  Clay shit sort of smell 
[04:00:00]  You know it just like  It just burns your fucking lungs  Of course  And it was crusting  Did you stay in that bathroom?  No I had to take  I had to take photos  And I was literally  Oh  What did you have to take photos for?  I was just  It's just  I was told to  So it was like  Who told you to take photos?  Travis  Travis has some weird fetishes  We'll get into that one day  But I don't know  What he's going to do  With all these  I was in there  And I couldn't even take it  And I could handle  Most gross shit you know  Yeah  It's horrible  Especially when it comes  To like assholes  Corey in New Jersey 
[04:00:30]  Hey buddy  What's going on?  How you doing?  Hey so yeah  I guess I get back  To those girls man  They try way too hard  To just be like  One of the guys  You know what I mean?  Like that shit is  That shit's out  There is definitely  A porn star thing  Where they come in  And for some reason  They do try to be  One of the guys  But it's like  You're hanging with  Like beasts  Of this  Like Norton  Anthony  Opie  Like they are  Just beasts  Of quickness 
[04:01:00]  And wit  And it's like  Guys can't come in here  And hang with them  What makes you think  That a porn star  Could do it?  But you know what it is  Go ahead Corey  But they're trying to  You know what I mean?  They try to hang in  With those dudes  And it just  But can I tell you  Like it doesn't  It doesn't do anything  For them  You know what I mean?  Can I tell you why  They do that though?  Exactly why  I'll tell you why  Because it's the same reason  That I'm telling  All these callers  That you at home  Can get a hateable 
[04:01:30]  Vibe from a girl  But we don't get that  In the studio  Because they're sitting here  Because they've spent  So much time  Having their lame jokes  Like laughed at  And having people  Treat them special  Because they're hot porn stars  That they don't really realize  What's happening  Yep  You know?  Absolutely man  We're doing them  A disservice Corey  Yeah pretty much  Alright buddy  Uh  LeB  Is your name LeB?  Yeah it's LeB  What's it short for? 
[04:02:00]  Ah it's my nickname  I grew up in a little town  And I'm like  I'm Lebanese  So  They called you LeB  And you're the one  Lebanese guy in Canada  And they called you LeB?  In Sundry  That's funny  Little shithole town  I grew up in  What's going on?  Yeah  I think I can solve  Your bathroom problem  Okay  Are you sure Danny  Wasn't in the building?  No  Decided to take a shit  All over Sirius XM  We can't be sure  Although we learned from  Apparently he's working  At Rockstar Games  If Laszlo was still here  I would ask him about that  But Laszlo said 48 hours 
[04:02:30]  After Danny was fired  From Sirius XM  He had hired him  At Rockstar  Rockstar Games  Thanks to Laszlo  And being such a good  Friend of the show  Is  The island of  Misfit toys  For the Opie and Anthony show  Danny works there  You guys remember  Derek the old production guy  He works there  You old school fans  You remember Than  From the Than and Sam show  He was a producer here  He quit the show like  Probably five years ago  At this point  You know where he works?  Rockstar Games  Everybody who leaves 
[04:03:00]  This studio  Ends up at Rockstar Games  If Laszlo ever wanted  To put together a podcast  Or something  He'd have the best staff  In all of podcasting  Are you sure  Maybe Danny didn't pay Laszlo  To go take a shit  All over the bathroom?  You're pretty sure  That Danny  Is the guy responsible  For the shit  Well I mean  I'd shit all over the company  If that was me  Alright well  I don't know Lab  I don't know  But I feel bad  For your nickname  Let me tell you something  You have almost no time left  Matter of fact  After this show

[04:05:00]  Love the show  I just wanted to comment  Quick  You're giving us  A little insight  As listeners  To what's going on  Behind the scenes there  And you kind of  Stole a little bit  Of my thunder earlier  With the whole  Ant and Jimmy  And how quick they are  But as a listener  I just try to find out  Is that for real  I mean is that  Is it that  I mean  Ant just ratchets up  Quite a few notches  Whenever there's girls  To do  And it's a lot of fun  To listen to  Yeah I mean  Ant and Jim  Are definitely  On the prowl  I will say  When certain ladies  Come in here  And yeah 
[04:05:30]  I mean  They usually  Because they're friends  They can kind of  Figure out  Who has a better chance  With whatever girls  In here  And they'll help  Each other out  But if there's a competition  There's a competition  When there's porn stars  In here  Ant and Jim  Are looking to get  Their fuck on  It's just the way it is  Who's not  If I could pull it off  I would  If I was  You know  A millionaire  Who had an  Awesome house  And a pool  And a hot tub  That stays open  All winter long  Because I can afford it  I'd be trying to  Fuck some porn stars too  You know  Wouldn't you
