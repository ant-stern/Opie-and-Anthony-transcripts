<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with a musical interlude and a countdown to XM channel 202.  The hosts then describe the chaotic scene outside their studio, where over 100 listeners, gathered since 1 a.m., were consuming alcohol and food in anticipation of a "cherry darts" contest involving two porn stars, whipped cream, and listeners throwing cherries at a target (later revealed to be a balloon knot on the porn stars' buttocks).  They recount a confrontation with the building security guard about the resulting mess. Anthony's aggressive early-morning driving habits are also discussed.  Jim Norton calls in, sharing his struggles with resisting prostitutes.  A phone sex segment with Allie from California follows, with explicit descriptions of her and her boyfriend's sexual activity, vying for the title of "sexiest state." The hosts compare her performance to a previous caller's, who boasted a "10-incher."  The upcoming "free play week" on XM Satellite Radio is mentioned, along with the associated pressure to maintain a cleaner broadcast.  Allie's performance is criticized for insincere dirty talk.

The show continues with updates on the increasingly rowdy crowd outside, the arrival of additional guests like Club Soda Kenny and Master Poe (who helps manage the crowd), and the news that Ben, a frequent contributor, has food poisoning.  The hosts detail the crowd's consumption of alcohol and ribs, and a humorous interaction with Sex Bagel, a staff member sent to interact with the listeners.  A news story about five men arrested for masturbating in a mall restroom is covered, with much vulgar speculation about their identities and actions. Mike Lieb and TJ Steele from Blue Smoke Barbecue arrive, delivering ribs and sparking conversation about their smoky flavor.  Giving whiskey to a homeless person is also mentioned.

The "Cherry Darts" competition preparation dominates a significant portion.  Extensive discussion ensues regarding logistics, crowd control, and the selection of participants (who are frequently referred to with demeaning language). Sex Bagel's nickname origin is explained.  The broadcast is peppered with tangents, including a listener's story about a DUI and impoundment, a humorous rendition of "Police Got My Car," and discussions about the 1970s, along with multiple calls with theme songs for Kenny, a large security guard.  The vulgar and sexually explicit language and jokes continue throughout.

The "Cherry Darts" contest itself takes center stage.  Extensive paperwork issues surrounding guest appearances are highlighted, particularly Candy's struggles filling out the forms. Candy's stated midget fetish is discussed, alongside fantasies about incorporating a midget listener (requiring an elf costume) into the show.  Drew Lynch's song "Gary Foster" (about midget tossing) is played.  Candy and a second porn star, Star, are interviewed.  They discuss their careers and preferences, with Candy revealing her recent entry into the adult film industry and expressing her desire for a midget-themed film. Both women are shown partially or fully nude during the contest. Logistical issues and Ben's illness cause significant delays and disruptions. The stricter regulations of their current studio are contrasted with past experiences.

The contest itself involves numerous intoxicated contestants (including Artie from Yonkers and Gootman), throwing whipped-cream-dipped cherries at the nude buttocks of Candy and Star. Kenny judges the throws using lipstick or a tape measure, leading to humorous disagreements and arguments.  The prizes are a MiFi and a portable XM radio. The vulgar language and bodily function references persist.  Sports commentary and advertisements for XM Radio and opianthony.net are interspersed.  Additional contestants arrive, adding to the chaos.  Winners are announced for the initial heats.

The "Cherry Darts" game continues, with contestants like Velez, John, Alex, and Lewis participating, and crude and offensive jokes prevalent.  The haphazard judging by Kenny leads to contentious moments.  The game proceeds through several rounds, culminating in a final round for the XM Delphi MiFi, which is won by a black contestant, Justin.  Linda, a would-be contestant, briefly exposes her buttocks and panties.  Further vulgar jokes, commercials, and off-color comments conclude the broadcast.

[00:06:00]  Thank you. 
[00:06:30]  That's really nice.  That's just too good to be true for most people.  Do you realize who you hired?  Beautiful girls, violent...  What kind of sick mind operates like that?  V.O.B. Anatomy Show.  Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker... 
[00:07:00]  Oh, shit.  No, no, no, no...  Nah, nah, nah, nah  Shut up! Shut up!  Quiet. 
[00:07:30]  Stop it!  Stop whining.  Stop whining.  Shut up! Shut up!  Shut up!  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah  Shut up!  Stop whining. 
[00:08:00]  Take out the papers and compress.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Son of a bitch.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Quiet.  Quiet.  Quiet.  Quiet.  Shut up!  Shut up!  We figured we'd try that.  I don't know.  There was a little too much music between the Rage and Linda McCartney backing up. 
[00:08:30]  Hey, Jude.  That's a classic.  Welcome to the O!B! and Anthony Program!  Hello.  Spreading the ONA virus across America.  Absolutely.  What have you done to spread the ONA virus, huh?  There we go.  That's much better.  Why do you want to be a little higher than me?  It's not.  For some reason, I'm lower when the faders are of equal fader.  Of equal fade. 
[00:09:00]  I've been staring at you for 10 effing years.  That's right.  Let's plaster the smiles on our faces and plow through this shit one more time.  One of the best Bill Hicks lines ever.  Yeah, yeah.  So happy to be here, wherever the hell I am.  Happy to be here.  Oh, wow.  So, we got a mess outside.  Oh, my God.  I just feel trouble is brewing. 
[00:09:30]  Is Club Soda Kenny around?  It's going to be a good show today.  Lots of security today.  Yeah.  That's what I'm seeing here.  We have Keith the Cop.  We have Club Soda Kenny.  We have Master Poe.  We have at least 30 drunks downstairs.  Just a mess down there.  I came in this morning and, oh, right when I'm walking up, I just see this big crowd of  people in front of the building.  And I kind of stopped for a second.  And I'm thinking, I got to walk through this.  I got to walk through these people. 
[00:10:00]  And who is partying like this at 4.30 in the morning, whatever time it was?  It's still, you know, it's still nighttime.  Don't you understand that?  You think it was still last night for them?  Of course.  They didn't sleep and then wake up like we did?  The building hates us again.  I'm walking down the sidewalk with my brother.  And as soon as they saw me coming, they just start screaming.  And they're trying to hand me booze and food.  Well, they brought food like Steve instructed.  Yeah.  Well, what we're talking about is we said that the first 25 people to show up outside the 
[00:10:30]  studio today will get a chance to win a MiFi, the portable XM radio.  Yeah.  Basically, we're doing cherry darts.  We've got two porn stars.  They're going to bend way over.  And our fine listeners are going to dip their little cherries in some whipped cream and  attempt to hit the balloon knot.  Right.  A simple, simple contest.  Of course it is.  So we asked for the first 25 people.  And according to Steve, because Steve started calling me around 4 in the morning, he said  that people have been hanging outside the building since 1 a.m. 
[00:11:00]  Since 1 in the morning.  They're smoking dope.  They're drinking whiskey.  Yeah.  They're sharing food.  Great.  They're yelling and screaming that they're cold.  So they're asking us to send Steve down with his flame freaking wear.  I hear a couple of them are wearing flame attire.  Yeah.  They've taken Steve's lead and they have flaming shirts and hats on.  Steve, what's going on out there?  Ow.  It's a mess. 
[00:11:30]  Yes.  My, Steve.  It's, I came walking down around 4.30 down 57th and all I heard was distant hooting and  hollering.  I was just like, ah, ah, ah, ah.  I'm like, oh God.  Yeah.  You could see like this cluster of people lined up outside the building.  Well, they brought your food, Steve.  They did.  They did.  And they just start cheering as I'm walking, walking.  I'm wiping sleep from my eyes and they're going, dude, we brought food.  Let us in.  Yeah.  They are all just whipped up down there. 
[00:12:00]  And they brought some creative food.  They didn't just bring like a box of donuts.  That's my, what was my brother saying?  Darren, what'd you see out there?  I saw that there's baby back ribs in a fine tangy sauce.  There's all sorts of gourmet items.  And then some schmuck comes down with box of the donuts and everybody mugs him.  I, you know, I would go for the baby back ribs.  There's baby back ribs.  Nice and warm down there.  Huge.  I don't know if you want to eat baby back ribs though.  So early in the morning, it's not really a breakfast food. 
[00:12:30]  My brother will eat it.  No, no problem there.  We're going to send Sex Bagel down in a couple minutes here.  Where's Club Soda Kenny?  Is he downstairs already?  Yeah.  Yeah, Club Soda's downstairs working the line already.  All right.  Keeping everyone in line.  And then Anthony, you showed up in the building guy, the ex-conduct.  All this building guy unloaded on me.  What did he say?  I walk in and I try to keep it nice.  I treat the guy like the soup Nazi from Seinfeld.  I know what I have to do.  I walk up to the desk.  I hand him my card.  He swipes it for some reason behind the counter.  I sign and I go, morning. 
[00:13:00]  And then walk off to the elevator.  I don't make any problems.  I don't want to talk to him.  And you don't change your routine.  I don't change the routine.  You don't ask how he's doing.  Nothing.  Just morning.  Right.  You don't want any problems.  And then I walk away.  I keep it simple.  I'm waiting for a problem every day.  I know.  That's why I do that.  And I kind of challenge him.  I pick at him a little bit every morning.  We are so different.  Oh, I know.  I just don't want a problem.  I want to get up here.  I don't want to talk to anybody.  You know?  I'm just leaving me alone.  I still sign in fake names in front of them. 
[00:13:30]  I read them.  I know.  I've just put my first initial and last name.  And I take a little extra time getting my card out.  I swear to you, dude.  I just pick at him.  Ever since we had that confrontation, I just pick a little bit.  I have my card out in my hand at the first door.  I know.  It's out.  I'm approaching him.  I hand it to him.  Sign.  Morning.  Move on to the elevator.  Sometimes I go, I'm looking through my wallet, and I'm like, wow, I don't know if I have  my card today.  Oh, no.  And you can see him getting ready to just pounce.  Yeah.  Getting ready to pounce his drunkenness on you. 
[00:14:00]  I do all that on purpose.  I'm such an ass.  No.  So this morning, I have everything ready.  I hand him the card.  I sign in.  He hands me the card back.  I go to, I say, morning.  I go to walk to the elevator.  He goes, they coming upstairs?  Like, all those people outside.  So I stop, and I'm like, oh, no, I got to talk to him.  Oh, you know, all the people outside?  Yeah.  I was like, yeah.  He goes, when?  And now I'm looking at my watch.  I'm like, well, I guess a couple of hours, maybe, they'll be up here. 
[00:14:30]  And then I go, I'll send someone down to keep them in line, like anything, just to get  me out of there.  So I go to walk away, and he goes, you know, they're making a mess out there.  Well, this whole job is to keep the sidewalk in front of the building clean.  I know.  He goes, cans and cigarette butts all over the place, and I got to clean up out there.  Well, like I said, I'll send someone down and make sure they stay in line. 
[00:15:00]  Okay.  And then he just grumbled, and I walked off to the elevator.  Yeah.  And then I, as I'm walking in, I believe it was you.  Was it you, or was it Keith that came in right after me?  Because I heard him say something to somebody else that was walking in.  Did I hold the elevator door?  No.  Did I wait to see who it was?  No, you didn't.  I was gone in a flesh, because I didn't want to deal with drunk guy anymore.  Can we rewind just a couple minutes before you came into the building?  Yes, Keith, the cop. 
[00:15:30]  You know, it's 4.30 in the morning, and there's very little traffic in Manhattan.  Yeah.  And, you know, I'm a patient sort of guy, and I'm waiting at the red light down in.  You're a cop that waits at red lights at 4.30 in the morning in Manhattan.  Are you insane?  I mean, I understand occasionally you take a few liberties, and that's understandable.  But, you know, there's really not much going on.  Yeah.  And, you know, here I am sitting at the light, and I'm drinking my cup of coffee.  And out of nowhere, this blur of an SUV goes blowing by me through the light. 
[00:16:00]  I think I saw a cab come to, like, a screeching halt.  And I'm like, holy shit, look at this guy, almost got blasted by this cab.  And you're thinking, I know, you're probably thinking, wow, is the president in town?  It's just a secret service, you know, whisking him into the middle of Manhattan.  So, you know, the light changes, and I start driving, and all of a sudden I look, and the SUV pulls into the garage.  And I go, son of a bitch.  And I pick up the phone, and I call Anthony, and it's Anthony. 
[00:16:30]  Is there any reason to violate the traffic rules and regulations of the city of New York that early in the morning?  I consider New York City before 5 a.m. the wild, wild west.  There are no laws.  There are, you know, suggestions, ideas that are scattered about.  But laws?  Nah.  I come out of the Midtown Tunnel every morning, and there's a light there before you can make the turn on to third.  And I, it's a stop sign to me. 
[00:17:00]  I just kind of stop, I take a look, and I go.  Sometimes, it's four lanes, by the way.  The far right lane is the turning lane.  Sometimes all the other lanes are full except for the far left lane.  I go in that one, blow through the red light, and cut all the way across everybody to the right because it's early in the morning.  And I shouldn't have to wait for lights.  And if I stop for that one, I'm screwed all the way up third.  I have a time that if I blow the light, I catch all the greens as they're turning green from red. 
[00:17:30]  So if I do, like, 25 miles an hour the whole way, I catch every single light, and I'm first on line, so no one's in front of me.  It's a dream come true.  So occasionally, Keith, yes, I do blow through the bus lane and parking lane on the far right to get through the lights and pass the cabs that, for some reason, don't want to go fast enough for me.  And if I don't pass them through there, I don't make the left turn on to Broadway.  I miss it completely.  The light turns red.  Tax another three minutes onto my trip.  Ha ha, he showed you up this morning. 
[00:18:00]  Well, fortunately, I do have the new 2005 cards today.  Oh, thank you, Keith.  Let me go keep Club Soda Kenny.  Believe me, I need that.  Hi.  Hi, Jim Norton.  How are you?  Good.  Tired, but all right.  You tired?  Did you work last night?  Yeah.  Do some spots?  Yeah, I did a spot.  I'm fine.  I'm thinking about the whore thing.  No, I called two, and I didn't leave a message for either, and I just hung up.  I panicked.  You panicked?  Yeah, I was close last night. 
[00:18:30]  I was in bad shape.  Yeah, if this is the first day of listening to the new Opie and Anthony show, Norton is  swearing off whoring.  How many days have you?  Probably a week, something like that.  I think how much money you've saved already.  I know, I know.  So I was actually on, I went on Craigslist a little bit, and I peeked around.  I told you you wouldn't make the week.  Yeah.  And it looks like you're going to make it now.  Oh, no, you got the weekend, though, bro.  Weekends are fine.  I don't do them on really, well, yeah, I do.  It shouldn't be that bad on weekends.  But you made two calls, so you were feeling the itch.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:19:00]  Dude, the last couple days, I made a few calls.  And I just got lucky, and neither one of them answered the phone.  Why are you trolling the websites, knowing it's going to just tempt you?  Because I put in certain keywords to look for, like, I hit a keyword, and I look it up  just to see if I can find a girl with certain things I want.  Certain attributes?  Yeah.  And if I don't see any ads with the keyword come up, I just sign off and go look for an  apartment.  Oh.  Yeah, it's disgusting.  It's sociopathic.  You shouldn't tempt yourself like that if you're trying to swear off the horse.  I know.  I know.  Now, what are you going to do for sex? 
[00:19:30]  It's one thing to swear off the horse, but you've got to subsidize your sex somehow.  Yeah, I know.  Therein lies the problem.  This wasn't a choice.  Like, oh, this is fun to do.  This was not a basic necessity.  I wasn't getting laid, so I'm spending money.  Yeah, you're going to have to now get a girl that you have to probably treat like a lady.  Like a lady.  You might actually have to go out on a date.  Yeah.  I went on a date recently, and it might have to go out to dinner and buy her maybe some  flowers or something.  What do you mean Norton date like?  They're awful. 
[00:20:00]  Dates with me stink.  It's like, do you want to come?  I've got to do a spot, so we'll eat something.  But that's kind of cool to be a comic.  You know what?  I've gone on a double date with Norton a couple times.  He's a completely different person.  He's a complete gentleman.  He's charming.  He's actually charming.  You've got to be nice.  Women do fall in love with him when they see Norton outside this atmosphere.  Yeah.  They think he's adorable.  Yeah, you can't be completely honest.  I mean, you've got to kind of...  So do these freaks downstairs yell and scream at you?  Yeah, as soon as I got in the cab, I saw him when I pulled up. 
[00:20:30]  I'm like, ugh.  Just like a hundred rapists just standing outside with whiskey bottles.  It's up to about a hundred people now?  It was mobbed outside.  I know they're going to send some of them away because they only have so many up.  But the guy's trying to do the same thing.  He'd give me liquor.  He's running up with whiskey.  He's like, dude, have some whiskey.  I'm like, I'm an alcoholic.  I know.  I just panicked.  I saw the guy with...  He's got like a bottle of Maker's Mark.  And he's holding it up, waving it around to me as I was walking in the building.  Like I want to do a shot of whiskey at five in the morning.  I'll tell you though, the whiskey goes very well with those baby back ribs. 
[00:21:00]  I bet.  I want to see these baby back ribs.  Yeah, bring up the baby back ribs.  And Sex Bagel's heading down to the curb there so we can talk to some of these people.  The sidewalk.  How many people are there?  There's about a hundred now?  Yeah, about a hundred.  Okay.  That's not bad.  Oh, boy.  We are so going to get in trouble.  Sex Bagel heads up there.  It just always ends badly for this show.  No, we got it under control this time around.  It's all under wraps.  I'm sure the whiskey won't get past that drunkard working the security at the front desk. 
[00:21:30]  He'll sniff it out.  Yeah, you want to snort?  I mean, that'll straighten right out.  I can't stomach that drunk.  Guys, we got to break into the program to say hi to Allie in California.  Allie!  Hey, how's it going?  Good.  What's going on?  Not much.  What do you want to do for the show today?  I want to take back California as the world's sexiest state.  Oh, it was taken yesterday by Pennsylvania.  We had a couple from Pennsylvania doing ass sex yesterday.  There is no way that some Amish country is going to beat us. 
[00:22:00]  Wow.  She does sound pretty sexy.  Do we know you?  You sound very familiar.  No, I've never called before.  Okay.  It's just that California accent.  Yeah.  You sound really hot, I got to tell you.  Really?  Yeah.  What do you look like?  I don't know what I look like.  My boyfriend says I'm hot.  What color is your hair?  Well, it used to be blonde.  I just dyed it.  So it's a little bit darker with blonde hair. 
[00:22:30]  Not Paris Hilton, is it?  She just dyed her hair from blonde.  No.  This could be fun because it's 3.20 in the morning.  Yeah, it will be fun.  So much for this show playing during the free play week.  Oh, geez.  Sorry, Kevin.  We tried.  But, you know, this couple wants to have sex on our show.  We've been on for exactly 19 minutes and already we've blown it.  Oh, we were going to try to keep it like.  Yeah, I guess I've got to explain.  Next week we're doing a whole free play thing for XM Satellite Radio where they're going to make this show available for everyone that subscribes to XM. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  You don't have to tell XM that you want the Opie and Anthony show as an add-on channel.  It's just going to be there so people can check us out.  If you're scanning around the dial, all of a sudden you can hit our channel and go, oh, what's this?  Right.  So Kevin, one of the bosses down there in D.C., begged us, said, could you guys kind of keep the show clean today?  You know, we understand you're doing the cherry darts and all that, but, you know, kind of keep the language a little cleaner and things like that.  Yeah.  No live sex because we need to rerun this show starting Sunday night at midnight to start off the free play week. 
[00:23:30]  And we're like, yeah, we'll try our best, Kevin.  No problem.  But, I mean, you've got this hot chick from California that sounds real sexy.  Yeah, what are we going to do?  Oh, well, you figure it out.  Come on.  We need this couple to try to become the sexiest state in America.  So now you have blonde hair.  Yeah.  How tall a gal are you?  I'm five, well, technically five, four, and three quarters.  Five, four, and three quarters.  How old are you?  I'm 20.  Ooh.  Opie, she's 20 years old. 
[00:24:00]  When were you a teen?  Well, teen is many years.  What do you mean?  I was born in 1984.  When's your birthday?  August day.  August.  So a mere few months ago, you were a teenager.  You were 19.  That is true.  It always goes back to teen.  I think it's close enough we could call this teen sexiest state.  How about almost teen sex?  Almost.  Ah, technicality.  Almost teen sexiest state. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, you're going to have a tough job today because Pennsylvania came out and just rocked  everyone's world.  The guy had a 10-incher and popped it up her poop shoe.  Up the dumper.  You heard it.  I was like doing porn star sex.  Like, this is going to be real.  Oh, it's going to be real, huh?  Well, yesterday was real.  Yeah, yesterday was real.  All right.  I think it was a act.  All right.  You got big boobies?  They're C's.  Nice C's.  How much do you weigh? 
[00:25:00]  You know, I don't know, actually.  Uh-oh.  I think it's like 125.  All right.  Oh, that's good.  It's better than yesterday.  Ooh, what we see.  All right.  So, what are you guys going to do today?  A Bruno San Martino body from yesterday?  What are you going to do today?  Um, a little bit of everything.  A little bit of everything.  I like sex, so.  Well, how long have you been with your guy?  10 months.  All right.  Are you guys naked?  Mm-hmm.  Okay, I guess you just got to walk us through it here. 
[00:25:30]  Okay, well, right now he's touching me.  Mm-hmm.  And it was really good.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I thought we lost the connection a second, then. 
[00:26:00]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:26:30]  Mm-hmm.  Yes, Anthony.  They can't hear us.  What is he digging for?  Oh, baby.  There we go. 
[00:27:00]  I'm just saying.  The listeners are begging.  They're saying, no, don't do it.  I know.  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  I got to do it.  What is that?  Oh, that is really nice.  She's getting real nice.  Oh, now he's doing a vibrator.  Vibrator?  Yeah.  Oh, fuck. 
[00:27:30]  Ew.  Ew.  Oh, fuck.  He's fucking trying to suck you.  Oh, God.  Yeah, I like it. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, fuck me.  Oh, fuck me like I'm a whore.  Put it on for me.  Oh, fuck me.  Oh, fuck me.  Oh, fuck me.  Oh, fuck me. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck me.  Come on, you bitch.  Yeah. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, shit.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[00:29:30]  Don't just stare at it. Eat it.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah, bitch. Fuck it.  Oh, my God.  I thought they were done, huh?  Yeah.  Oh, fuck you.  Yeah, you like that? 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Her dirty talk is really beginning to sound insincere and bug-making.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Do you know what a boob is?  Do you know what a boob is?  Do you know what a boob is? 
[00:31:00]  I'm looking for a funny kind.  Yeah!  You slave. 
[00:31:30]  You slave.  You slave.  You slave.  You slave.  Yeah.  Really slave. 
[00:32:00]  Baby...  Baby...  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh. 
[00:32:30]  How would you make me?  Marsha, Marsha, Marsha!  Holy crap.  Oh, crap.  You fucking slut.  We don't have all day. 
[00:33:00]  We got a radio show to do.  Well, you guys want to go for the grand finale here or what?  Oh, it's the grand finale.  They did. 
[00:33:30]  What's the grand finale?  I wasn't sure if you got your big O or not.  Oh, oh, no.  Well, we can go again.  I can go again for sure.  Uh-huh.  Bravo!  Allie from California!  I don't know what to do now.  What?  Well, I know what to do.  Well, we will now go to, you know, the listeners and they will judge.  They will be the final.  They will try to figure out if California beat out Pennsylvania as the sexiest state in America? 
[00:34:00]  As the sexiest state.  Just so you know, that's tame.  We have many more chicks at first leave.  That was tame?  So if you don't get the title, you can try again, right?  Right.  Oh, oh, we will.  Well, you guys rock.  We'll try again anyway.  All right, you guys.  We'll all have to keep topping ourselves.  You guys definitely rock.  You are a fine couple.  Although, it's hard to...  No.  The reason it's hard to beat yesterday is because yesterday she took 10 in the balloon  nut.  Right.  I should do that too.  Yeah, I agree.  What woman shouldn't?  You totally would say that when you just want. 
[00:34:30]  That's fantastic.  Yeah, definitely.  All right.  Hmm.  Okay, we're going to have to figure out if you guys beat out yesterday, all right?  Okay.  You guys definitely did a great job today.  Good job.  Thank you.  Thank you.  It was a nice surprise and a nice way to start off the 45th Opie and Anthony program.  Oh, 45.  Oh, 45.  Yes.  Well, we like to do our part.  Well, thank you, Allie.  Thank your boyfriend for us and we'll be in touch, okay?  He says thank you. 
[00:35:00]  All right.  Very good.  Goodbye, miss.  There they go.  Allie and the boyfriend from California.  Votes are coming in.  They're not very positive.  Why?  Well, she was good.  You know, it sounded good, but the insincere dirty talk killed her chances.  Yeah.  See, Jimmy didn't like that.  I didn't find it that good either.  Only because you never know.  It's like if that was sincere, I would have whacked my bag right here, but you just don't  know.  Yeah.  Sometimes I always tend to go.  I think her.  What was she calling him a bitch or something?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:35:30]  A little bitch.  Like calling herself a slut and saying, you know, F me like I'm a whore.  That's fine.  Yeah, absolutely.  Absolutely.  But then saying, yeah, you bitch do it.  It's kind of like a girl called me a bitch while I'm having sex with her.  That's a little odd.  Yeah.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Right.  Yeah.  Might have to smack her.  You dude.  Yeah.  Hey, gentlemen.  Yeah.  Take that, fella.  Yeah. 
[00:36:00]  There you go.  It just seemed a little weird.  It took me aback.  I kind of like Dally though.  I thought she was great, but I just, I thought it was a, it was a great way to start the show  today.  Larry saying no way.  Yeah.  It's a great way to start the show, but I don't think they, they took the title from  yesterday.  But they actually were better than I thought they were going to be as it came into the  home stretch.  It was actually just listening to it.  I filled up very nicely.  So, you know, we don't know.  We just don't listen to anyone.  Now the show is ruined.  No, it's not.  For the free play week.  That's fine.  We tried though.  Kevin, we did try. 
[00:36:30]  We did try.  How about they just take out the first, that little 10 minute hunk?  Nah, screw it.  Now with Van Halen.  Now we don't have to worry about it.  Now we just do our regular show.  Right.  Look what we do now.  That's right.  Okay.  We're going to get an update from, um, from the sidewalk after the break, Anthony.  Right.  At least 25 people outside now.  I think they're trying to send some people away cause it became a mad house out there.  Yeah.  At last count, there was over a hundred people out there trying to get inside the building  to do cherry darts today.  And they all brought food.  Yes.  We got to talk to Club Soda Kenny.  He's here.  Um, I don't know when the porn stars are showing up. 
[00:37:00]  Let's hope it's not five to 10.  There's going to be a problem outside if they're not here shortly.  Oh my goodness.  Yeah.  Porn stars usually not up at about at six 30 AM.  And we want to see what kind of food these guys got cause I'm hungry.  I'm sure they'll get quite a nice welcome from the crowd.  The porn stars when they do show up.  Yeah.  I'm sure that won't want to send them running when they see, you know, a hundred alcoholics  with hard ons and ribs and cereal boxes.  That's what you want to walk into a building and see.  Oh good.  Into my anus.  But no canned goods.  Yeah. 
[00:37:30]  No canned goods.  Donuts, ribs, and whiskey.  Yeah.  Nice.  Outside the station today and everyone is trying to win a MiFi.  Yeah.  They're all going to be taking dumps that Ben is envious of.  The portable XM radio.  That's one of the hottest Christmas gifts this season.  Ben is out again today.  Yeah.  Ben, I guess we could get a Ben update in a little while.  Yeah.  Did anyone talk to him?  He's never sick.  Bro.  He was definitely at the doctor and it was food poisoning really bad.  It was.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was all freaked out, so.  Yeah, he's going to be fine.  Anthony, as we go to break, I found the Nutcracker Suite. 
[00:38:00]  Oh.  Something we did.  Yeah, something we did.  Something we did and it has a holiday theme, so let's check it out.  Yes, it does.  Two guys getting kicked hard right in the crotch with no protection.  Oh.  Oh, that got him.  Oh, that got him.  Oh, that got him.  If he wasn't chained up, he would have fallen down.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[00:38:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  That's it.  That's gotta be it.  Oh.  That's gotta be it.  Dude, that's gotta be it.  Oh, my God.  All right, let's see if we can't get a good kick in from Grandma.  Grandma is lining up.  Oh.  Oh.  He's down.  He's down.  He's down.  He's down.  He's down.  You don't taunt Grandma like that.  Come on.  She got the bullseye.  Grandma still got a chance, right?

[00:43:00]  It's an Opie and Anthony Wow Sticker Stop.  This Wednesday, from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m., get to Cruisin' with RC's 53 East Main Street in Ramsey, New Jersey.  Whoa!  Those aren't real.  Yes, they are.  Get to Cruisin' with RC's 53 East Main Street, Ramsey, New Jersey, and pick up your Wow Stickers.  I'm getting an erection as we speak.  Once again, here is how it should sound. 
[00:43:30]  The Wow Sticker Stop.  Brought to you by your pals at the Opie and Anthony Show.  You can never really find a good sound effect of a guy getting hit in the head with a shovel.  Good evening, sir.  May I interest you in our soup de jour?  Shut the fuck up, you goddamn fuckhole, you piece of shit!  You don't need an erection. 
[00:44:00]  Swallow, swallow, gulp.  Mmm, very good.  No?  Hewler, anyone?  No?  Can't find it?  What? 
[00:44:30]  Um...  No, I can't now.  Alright.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Shut the fuck up, bitch.  We like to call it the ONA virus.  That was a nice surprise to start off the show today.  You never know what you're going to hear when you listen to our program.  We didn't know that a couple was going to attempt to become the sexiest state in America right off the bat today, Anthony.  Absolutely not.  I think the votes are in, and Pennsylvania still has the title, right?  Yes.  Although Allie and her boyfriend did a fine job in California, a great job.  They were hot, but you really gotta, you know, you gotta be really, really good. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, and you gotta get really creative now at this point, because we've had a lot of people do it.  The bar has been risen.  Risen.  And I think every time contestants have come on to compete, they have won.  I think it's just the fact that they have done it.  Yeah.  That has put them over the top and made them sexiest state.  I think this is the first time we've actually not crowned a new champ.  No, and as we go forward, you're going to have to really, really, really come up with  something different to take the title from Pennsylvania, I do believe. 
[00:45:30]  Hey, Brian in Arizona, what's up, buddy?  Hey, what's happening?  I don't believe any people in Pennsylvania did the job.  There's no way she took it in the balloon night.  I don't know.  That sounded...  I heard the replay four times.  I kept searching out that segment yesterday.  I was listening to that over and over again.  I loved that one yesterday.  There was no pause when he went from right here to do the balloon night. 
[00:46:00]  She had to ease it in for a little while.  You never know.  I believe that they did the balloon night yesterday.  I really do.  That scream she made could only be...  Right.  Balloon night action.  Either murder or ass sex.  Either what or ass sex?  Murder.  Ass sex or murder.  All right, Brian.  Vote for California.  Thanks, Brian.  Thank you, Brian.  Yes, Steve.  Are you writing notes?  Why don't you just say it on the mic?  Because it's not relevant to what you were talking about right now.  Oh, all right.  Is it a Ben update? 
[00:46:30]  Actually, I did talk to Ben.  He will be in very shortly.  Oh!  Ben is on his way in.  Our little Ben.  He has no idea.  He's barking and jerking his way in.  He has no idea of the abuse he took yesterday.  Yeah.  Puts his arm up for a cab and then jerks it right back down again and starts moving.  That's why he can't get a taxi.  He's going to be 20 pounds lighter today when he walks through that door.  I guarantee he's still sweating.  Dude!  Dude!  It was insane!  Is he going to be walking all funny because he's chafed?  You won't notice the difference.  Who else is excited to get the Ben update today? 
[00:47:00]  I can't wait to see him.  He'll be tired.  We all can't wait.  I want to hear what his day was like yesterday.  We killed him yesterday to the point I can't wait to see him walk through the door.  He's like a celebrity now.  I know.  He was miserable when I talked to him later on the day.  His day of food poisoning.  His day of food poisoning, yeah.  Ben's sushi.  Okay, we're doing cherry darts today.  The porn stars are on their way.  They're going to be here in about a half hour, 40 minutes.  We got, at last count, about 100 people downstairs.  We can only invite 25 up because that's the rules.  Those are the rules.  And, yeah, 25 people are going to come up and throw cherry darts at the porn stars' back doors. 
[00:47:30]  And, you know, the closest one to the balloon nut is going to win a MiFi, the portable XM radio.  Do we have some kind of measuring device for the close calls?  Well, we're just going to have to...  Need a stick?  We're going to have to get two official judges.  Yeah.  And that's going to be it.  Mm-hmm.  Maybe Kenny.  Club Soda Kenny would be a good judge, I think.  He's very fair-minded.  He is very fair-minded, right?  Let's go down to the streets of New York City, the sidewalk outside the building, and talk to Sex Bagel. 
[00:48:00]  Sex Bagel!  Hey, guys.  I'm down here on the street.  There's well over 100 people lined up down here.  Everyone say hi to O-N-A!  Wow.  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  These are a bunch of drunken strategies out here.  Yeah, we told you guys.  We told you guys.  So, Eric, they got food and everything down there, right?  There's more than just food. 
[00:48:30]  There's gourmet pastries.  There's one guy who's claiming he has gourmet barbecue, whatever that is, but it smells fantastic.  Those must be the ribs.  There's beer cans everywhere.  There's an empty whiskey bottle laying around.  There's cigarette butts.  Well, that's just for the homeless people that we see every morning walking in.  It's just a madhouse.  Oh, this is just going to be a mess today.  Thank you, sir.  This is just going to be a mess.  And there's actually a few females lined up here in the waiting out here. 
[00:49:00]  Are you kidding?  Are they insane?  No, no.  There's one right here.  Kenny, check out this girl.  What do you think of her?  Let me tell you something.  You're fucking hot.  You should definitely compete in a contest.  I bend you over.  I'll stick a cherry right in there.  What's your name, miss?  Linda.  Linda, and you're here to compete for the MiFi?  That I am.  You understand what you have to do for the MiFi?  I guess so, yeah.  All right.  That is hilarious.  Girl.  This blonde is very attractive, guys. 
[00:49:30]  I think maybe you want to tilt the scales a tiny bit in her favor.  All right.  You're wearing panties?  She's sort of wearing panties.  What does that mean?  They're a little bit skimpy.  A little bit skimpy.  Nice.  Skimpy panties.  You've got to respect that.  Was that a little code thing he said?  Tip the scales in her favor?  Did he say that?  Like, as a code to her being a...  Hey, Eric.  Yes.  Is she fat?  No, not at all.  What were we talking about?  Good question, though.  I thought it was a code word.  Tip the scales in her favor. 
[00:50:00]  Looks like fat!  Oh, it certainly looks like fat tonight.  There's people showing off their flame shirts here.  They're screaming, send Steve down here because they're cold.  Yeah.  I heard people showed up with, like, flame shirts and hats and stuff like that.  Hey, let's talk to Club Soda Kenny.  Okay.  Hold on.  Kenny?  It is a pencil, Swami.  Yeah, hello.  Hey, Kenny.  What's going on?  Good morning, boys.  How are you? 
[00:50:30]  Hello, Kenny.  You sound nice and chipper this morning.  Well, it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.  The sun's coming up.  There's a mob of people down here waiting to bend over and get cherries thrown at their  ass and whatever it takes.  No, that's not what's going on, Kenny.  We're not throwing cherries at our listeners' butts.  What are we doing?  Well, they're going to throw the cherries at the porn stars.  All right.  I'm sorry.  I'm a little confused.  I'm big and stupid. 
[00:51:00]  Yes, you are.  We have a couple Club Soda Kenny theme songs, too, that we want to try out for you when you  get back up into the studio, okay?  Well, you know, that's what I was just discussing with the listeners.  What are you going to do?  Suck a dick to get a theme song?  Some listeners should make me up for theme songs.  Well, they're coming up with theme songs.  You know, we just haven't found one we like yet.  All right.  Cool.  All right.  Hey, give the phone back to Sex Bagel.  Okay.  Hurry up, God damn it!  Hey, guys.  All right.  Sex Bagel, you've got to get all 6'5 of Club Soda Kenny to skip up and down the sidewalk 
[00:51:30]  for the fans.  Okay.  Hold on one second.  Hey, wait.  Ask the fans if they want to see that.  Ladies and gentlemen, as a gift from the boys, would you like to see Club Soda Kenny skipping  up and down the street for your amusement?  Club Skoda.  Club Skoda.  He's awful.  I think that's a yes.  All right.  Skip.  And there he goes, skipping down the street. 
[00:52:00]  I know how ridiculous this looks.  It really is awful.  People just cheering him on.  It's quite a sight.  And now he seems to be giving a lap stance to a lady dragging a suitcase down the street.  That's Kenny.  Sorry about that, man.  All right.  Okay.  There we go.  Good job, Skeks Bagel.  Skeks Bagel.  All right.  Well, are we going to bring some of the food and stuff up or what? 
[00:52:30]  I believe we have two racks of ribs that are just entered upstairs and being heated for  your enjoyment.  I think maybe the ladies could probably be brought away from that crowd.  So they're not potential victims.  Yeah, I agree with you.  And so maybe we don't lose them.  Okay.  Yeah.  We like ladies.  We like ladies to listen to this show.  You know.  Yeah.  Okay.  We don't want them running off.  I will have Kenny personally escort them up.  All right. 
[00:53:00]  Kenny's coming back up with the girls?  Yes.  Okay.  Steve, anything?  The entire studio outside.  I don't know if it's here yet.  It smells like ribs.  I can smell it, actually.  You can smell the ribs.  Yeah.  It's like doing Hot 97.  All right, Skeks Bagel.  Tell the gang that we'll be with them shortly.  All right.  Will do.  All right.  Bye.  There you go.  Skeks Bagel downstairs on the sidewalk outside the building.  Totally nailed it.  Did I get him?  Yeah.  It does smell really nice.  Yeah.  Come for O&A, but stay for the ribs. 
[00:53:30]  Stay for the ribs.  It's a madhouse out there.  Yeah.  That is really just trouble.  Some nut probably put acid in one of the ribs.  I know.  That's what keeps me from eating anything.  Dude, watch this.  Well, that's why we got Master Poe.  There are people that, what, he's going to be the official taster?  Yeah.  He'll be the food taster.  That's good, because if they put acid in it, that's the guy you want tripping.  Yeah.  The martial artist killer.  That's good.  Oh, the little fella?  Certain other people looking around. 
[00:54:00]  He's all right.  Go grab a rib.  Yeah, I have a rib.  He hasn't bothered us lately.  He's fine.  I'll go out and kiss him right in the mouth.  I don't give a shit.  He hasn't bothered us lately.  He's fine.  The Oompa Loompa's fine.  Whatever.  No.  We're all just trying to get along.  I don't have some ribs.  We'll give him some ribs to make friends.  Okay.  I don't drink beers that people bring over anymore.  I'm all paranoid.  And Kenny won't let us.  No.  You ever notice that?  Yeah.  People bring beers over when we're out.  They say, hey, I have a beer.  And if it's open, Kenny will take it and throw it away.  He'll smash it on the floor right in front of the listener. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  It's like, Kenny, what are you doing?  I will not allow you to drink something that is not hermetically sealed.  He gets all defensive.  He does.  I guess that's a good thing.  Yeah.  Why don't we have...  We could have Ben taste it.  See if it's poison.  Since his ass is already chafed.  Like one of those...  What's the flavor?  The onion and what's the other?  Salt potato.  It's a nice salt and vinegar potato chip.  That's what he's got between his cheeks.  Ow. 
[00:55:00]  Rubbing.  That last hour of radio yesterday, I listened to four times.  I couldn't get enough of that last hour.  I didn't hear the replays yesterday.  That's why I love the replays.  Poor Ben.  Love the replays on 202.  Poor Ben.  Poor Ben some Pepto-Bismol.  Jerome in Boston, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Real quick, the rules of the game, they kind of changed.  I remember I played, I think, the first one.  I don't know if it was the first one.  We won the Xbox or someone played to win the Xbox. 
[00:55:30]  Cherry darts?  Yep.  Cherry dart game.  And people were trying to throw the cherry at the vagina.  No, they weren't.  No, it was always the balloon nut.  Always the balloon nut.  Oh.  Yeah.  All right.  Maybe you were aiming a little low.  That's why you lost.  That's why you lost, fella.  No, I remember it.  Wait.  Maybe it was the vag.  No.  It definitely was the vag, man.  I think it was, too.  No.  We have it on video, don't we?  I don't know.  I think he's right.  I think it was the vag.  Why would we do that?  Hence the pigs? 
[00:56:00]  Hence the cherry.  Yeah, but the balloon nut is such a better target.  It's a harder target.  Steve is the historian of the O.P. and Anthony show.  Historian.  Videographer.  Sure.  Are you getting video of these freaks outside?  Yeah, I got some early on.  I'll go back down a little bit.  Okay.  When we did cherry darts last time, was it the balloon nut or the whale's eye?  It was whale's eye.  No.  I will bet you $100.  You can go see pictures right now.  It was all...  I remember you throwing one.  And it was a bullseye because it landed right in her balloon nut. 
[00:56:30]  Well, it might have morphed into that at one point, but it started out with the girl  on the table with the bullseye drawn on her.  Yeah, I do remember that.  No, I'm positive.  Good call by the listener.  Yeah.  Well, so we switched it around.  Is it possible, but is it an impossibility to get it into the balloon nut or no?  It is a much smaller target.  It's like putting up a dartboard and say, let's aim for the three.  You know?  The bullseye's right there staring you in the face.  Well, we weren't thinking clearly at the old show.  The balloon nut is like the bullseye. 
[00:57:00]  It's like, you know, lower.  All right.  That's funny.  Thank you, Steve.  Yep.  Are people starting to come up here?  The rib guys came up.  Dude, Master Poe's got to calm the F down.  Yeah, I'm talking to him.  I'm talking to him.  Tell him to relax.  He's a little militant.  Talk him down.  He's very militant.  What do you mean?  They're just our listeners.  Yeah, he's smacking some sense into people yet.  It's not like Al-Qaeda's lined up outside.  It's just our goofy listeners.  He's trying to be...  It's like, take the booze out of the hand and get him up here. 
[00:57:30]  Let's relax.  Well, no.  He's doing everything thoroughly, but his way of being friendly is very Gestapo-like.  I understand that.  He's got to relax, because we're all just having fun here.  Look at him.  He's intense.  Yeah, he does get a little...  Yeah, I've got to go talk him down.  That's how you know he likes you.  If he doesn't throw an elbow to your throat, that's a sign of affection.  He's a friend.  In the end, this is all just fun, and people should keep the smiles on their faces.  He is intense.  You could be vigilant, as far as security goes, with a smile. 
[00:58:00]  With a smile.  There you go.  All right, before we take a break, it's the story of the day.  Everyone is sending us this story.  Five men arrested in mall restroom.  All right.  What do you think the five men were doing in a mall restroom?  Hiding shoplifted clothing, perhaps?  No.  Smoking in a no-smoking area?  I think it was a Sears.  Where?  A Sears restaurant.  I think it was Macy's.  In Paramus.  Oh, Macy's?  Was it Macy's?  Doesn't matter, I guess, huh? 
[00:58:30]  Five men were caught masturbating.  Five guys in the Christmas rush.  Five guys in the bathroom.  They were having a circle jerk in the restroom at a mall.  Having a circle jerk.  And you know when the cop walked in, they probably just turned around quickly, and two  of them didn't have urinals.  Oh, do you have experience at that, Jimmy?  No, but I'm just guessing.  I'm an actor.  Five men were caught masturbating in a public restroom Tuesday afternoon during an undercover  sweep at the Bergen Mall.  Authority said. 
[00:59:00]  You will keep your hands off of my meal.  Uh, officers made the arrest throughout the day after the men began stimulating themselves  in an open area of a public restroom, also used by non-consenting adults and children.  Why don't you stop playing with yourself, Willie?  Hmm.  Oh, they weren't in the same moment.  I guess not.  Wait, what?  It was throughout the day.  It wasn't like...  They got five in one day.  Police arrested Bernard.  I'm not going to give these guys, uh, I'm not going to give the last name out, these  poor guys. 
[00:59:30]  Police arrested Bernard.  We could do that.  Remember we did that in Boston?  Yeah, we could do that.  Boston started, uh, printing the names of Johns.  So we would call them up, and if their wife would answer, we'd talk about the article.  A lot of them didn't know.  Oops.  Yeah, we broke the news.  Remember that one lady?  Uh-huh, it's just a price.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, well, who's this?  This is a joke.  I know it's a joke.  Bring the ribs in.  And we're like, isn't his birthday February 5th? 
[01:00:00]  And she's like, who is this?  Uh-oh.  Yeah, maybe we should call them up.  But they were jacking during, uh, different times.  Here come the ribs, Anthony.  They look fantastic, but, uh, you could put them right down over there.  Wow.  Are you guys?  Yeah, that's amazing.  Yeah, right there.  You guys are the rib guys?  Yes, sir.  Wow-wee.  You're going to want to give a plate to my brother immediately.  All right.  Which plate do you want, sweetie?  I'll be the official tester. 
[01:00:30]  All right.  Why don't you take the one that looks like, um, the Flintstones there?  These are Kansas City and the other ones are baby backs.  Wait, you've got to talk on mic, bro.  Oh, that sounds good.  Some of them are Kansas City and the other ones are baby backs, but-  Kansas City.  You know, we had to hit them all up in the microwave, and we've been sitting outside drinking  all night, so it might not be the best representation, but-  Yeah, what time do you guys get here?  About two or something.  Two.  A couple bottles of whiskey later, you know?  You guys have been drinking whiskey outside since two?  Yes, sir.  We fed your whole line.  We had, uh, four bottles and a bottle of vodka, and we got one bottle of whiskey left, 
[01:01:00]  have a bottle of vodka.  Were you guys the first on the line?  Uh, no, but we made our way up there with the booze, you know?  You make friends quick.  Yeah, yeah.  It's all about that, you know?  That's what it works.  A couple of our contestants that we'll be throwing the cherry dars in.  Yeah.  Yes, sir.  Oh, you guys want to plug anything?  You've got to be- you've got to work for some rib place, no?  No, we're from Blue Smoke Barbecue, you know?  Where's that?  It's on 27th between Park and Lex.  We also have a Jazz Standard.  It's a jazz club downstairs, but otherwise, we're just representing the army, you know?  Have some ribs. 
[01:01:30]  Represent the ONA Army.  Nice.  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  Darren?  Uh, is my soup and salad coming, or-  Yeah, excuse me.  It's on the way.  It's on the way, dude.  You've got a whiskey soup and a scotch salad on the way.  Very cool.  How are they, good?  Very tangy.  Very flavorful.  Tangy.  It's too early.  Tangy or flavorful.  They're nice and smoked, you know, the nice 420 bong time temperature.  Put some milk over them.  Put some milk over them.  Definitely smoky.  Yeah.  The buttermilk.  A little early. 
[01:02:00]  All right.  Great.  It's making the studio smell a lot better.  Yeah.  I'm sure Jim will screw that up with a fart.  He certainly will.  Time.  What's your names, man?  Mike Lieb and TJ Steele.  Yes, sir.  Mike and TJ.  Right on.  Thanks for the ribs.  We appreciate it.  All right.  Thanks for having me.  Thank you, gentlemen.  And we'll see you shortly.  Yeah, we want to throw some cherries, you know?  Of course you do.  That's what everyone's here for today.  We'll score the cherries in the hole.  Smoking some cherries.  Anything else going on outside that you can report?  Eh, we're smoking some balls, some bongs.  We had the garbage men drinking the whiskey with us. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, we had the garbage men.  Oh, there you go.  Sanitation department.  Hooking up sanitation.  What about all the homeless guys that sleep on 57?  No, we actually gave one of them a bottle of whiskey to take with him.  Oh, you're a good guy.  Wow.  Look at that guy.  The holiday spirit is hitting everybody.  Represent the Army, boys.  A little bit for everybody.  All right.  Cool.  Well, why should the homeless miss out this festive time of year?  The big truth.  The big truth.  Very good.  Thank you, guys.  All right, well, thanks for having us.  Enjoy the ribs.  Beast them up.  All right, we'll see you in a little bit.  Smoked out, right?  Cool.  Thanks, boys.  All right, thank you.  That's fantastic. 
[01:03:00]  They smell great.  Yeah, they really do.  The problem is it's 7 in the morning.  I know.  Can't eat ribs.  I'm still trying to eat my stupid oatmeal.  I just don't dig on swine.  Gotta have a hell of a personality for me to eat it from some listener with alcohol on his breath.  Nah, those ribs are safe.  You can tell.  I know.  No, no, I'm worried about it.  Well, look what just happened to Ben.  I mean, yeah, I know.  Bacon's good.  Oh, good point.  Porkchop's good.  These guys are from New York.  They just promoted the place they came from.  Yeah.  All right, let's get back to the guys whacking it in the... 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, so it turns out that individuals were going in there.  I don't know, man.  And jacking, or it was a circle chair.  This is a small version of the story.  If someone has the extended version, you know, I guess there'll be more details.  I didn't see.  Oh, man, they've been sending this in like crazy today.  Anyway, so they arrested five men, caught masturbating in a public restroom Tuesday afternoon during  an undercover sweep at the Bergen Mall.  The arrest throughout the day, so that sounds like it was throughout...  Yeah, I guess if it was like an undercover sweep, this is something they've heard about 
[01:04:00]  that was happening.  It's a lot funnier if they caught five guys in a circle jerk in the bathroom.  It is, but it's also a lot creepier that this is not just an isolated incident that people  know to stop in there to show their hogs and the other like-minded gentlemen.  And jacket.  Yeah.  Well, all right.  That's not random.  But there's five guys, so there were either like two, two, and one by himself.  One odd man out.  Or two and three guys.  And three.  So that's, you know, that's a little weird.  One and four.  Do a whole bunch of comedy. 
[01:04:30]  So police arrested Bernard, 38.  I'm not going to say what he does.  Poor guy.  What kind of jobs does he do?  What does he do?  Bernard.  He's a salesman.  I'm sorry.  Shoots black guys on the subway?  Dr. Larry.  Dr. Larry?  Oof.  Wait.  All right.  Bernard, the salesman, was 38.  Dr. Larry.  Poor guy.  What?  70.  Oh, no.  Couldn't take it.  He's in the office all day helping sick people.  Look at those big, delicious dicks.  He just had to have one. 
[01:05:00]  70.  Stupid Dr. Larry.  He's an anesthesiologist.  That's great.  Honey, I'm going to the mall to do some shopping.  They probably got to the point he just got so desperate.  He's been married forever.  And he's like, you know what?  Maybe he took a Viagra and his wife is, you know, one of those old bags that don't want  to do it anymore.  And he had a big throbbing one.  Figured he'd go to the mall and take care of business.  Somebody in Sears take care of it.  Sure.  Smart thinking.  So, Dr. Larry, 70.  Then he got Robert, a retired banker, 73. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, God.  Just a bunch of old codgers going in there and whacked a wrinkly guy.  Whacking their old taffy.  Then he got Michael, a development director for a Jewish community center, I guess.  How old is he?  Oi.  48.  Hey.  And then good old Nestor.  Nestor?  A data entry clerk.  53.  Ugh.  What the hell are these?  What are they thinking?  73, 48, 53. 
[01:06:00]  And 38.  All were charged with lewdness and criminal sexual contact and released on their own recognizance.  What if you're in the stall?  Like, were they?  Any more details on this?  Yeah, we need more details.  If they were in the bathroom, like, just as you walk in and jacking it, I could see  that being a problem.  If you want to, you know, relieve yourself and you go in a stall and do it, is that illegal?  Hmm.  I don't know.  Unless there are two people in the stall and they saw, you know, four feet. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  Four feet in the stall there.  Steve, why are you laughing?  All these guys out here, they're having a good time.  Those guys are hammered.  Those are the troublemakers.  They brought the whiskey for everybody.  Yeah, it's just, no, they're having a good time.  We had a lot of security.  It's just going to develop very, very interesting.  And I'm corralling porno chicks in their hotel rooms telling them to hurry the F up.  Did you ask anybody else in your office if they want some ribs?  Yeah, I'll do that right now.  Thanks. 
[01:07:00]  Steve, you're...  I'll do that right now.  Cherry.  Oh, is that...  What, the cherries have arrived?  Okay, do it, do it, do it.  Look at this.  It's freaking...  Now you've got them up against the window.  Steve's all excited.  His phone rings.  It's cherries.  The cherries have arrived.  The cherries are here.  What about the girls?  We've got the whipped cream.  We've got the cherries.  We've got the drunk listeners.  Yes, sex beggar.  What's wrong?  Everything all right?  All right, where's our club soda candy?  The ribs are good, right?  All right.  Steve?  Oh, Jimmy broke down and he's eating them.  I'll have one.  The cherries have arrived? 
[01:07:30]  I'm sure they're fine.  Steve's going downstairs to pick them up right now.  Okay.  I forgot what we were going to say.  That's all right.  Keith the cop coming into the studio.  It's a mad house today.  Keith, what's going on downstairs?  House security, Keith.  Working out?  They're a little jacked up downstairs, but it's coming along.  A little jacked up.  How many people are down there?  About 150.  You know, it's good now.  The people from the building are starting to show up.  You know, they're working in the other offices.  Oh, boy.  Oh, it's going all well.  That's when they forgot about last Wednesday. 
[01:08:00]  They have to deal with this today.  Oh, boy.  Just on a quick side note, I happened to catch the story downstairs about the men whacking  their bag in the bathroom.  Oh, right, yeah.  I used to have some prior experience with that in one of the local parks here in the  city, and you would catch eight or ten guys standing at the stall, and they'd all be whacking  their bags looking at each other.  And I tell you, it's the greatest ticket to write, because nobody ever fights it.  You get to go to court.  Like one guy, one time he wanted to fight it, and I told him, I said, listen, I have 
[01:08:30]  no problem with you fighting it.  I said, I'm going to show up to court in front of 100 people.  I'm going to tell everybody that you were whacking your bag looking at another man's  cock.  And then nobody ever showed up to court.  It was great.  That doesn't seem like an easy one.  Absolutely.  So you think these guys were doing it right in the open, or were they in a stall?  Oh, no.  They were probably standing at the urinal, and they were probably just looking over at  each other.  And I would get the old 75, 80-year-old guys standing there, and you'd catch them, and 
[01:09:00]  then they'd, you know, all right, let's go.  What happens to your home life that it comes down to...  That you're jacking in a public bathroom.  Next to another guy at a urinal.  Yeah, what's the fascination?  We had one guy, I'm telling you, he had to be 80, and he almost, like, had a walker.  And it was, like, trying to get him out of there.  Like, you couldn't give the guy a ticket, because he was a mess.  But it would take him, like, 45 minutes to get the walker and, like, get out of the  bathroom.  The shame is punishment enough.  Oh, yeah.  I told you, the first time I realized that gay guys did that, when I was on the way home 
[01:09:30]  from the Rascals Open Mike in South Jersey, and my fat friend Larry is sitting in  the car, and I'm taking a leak in the Parkway restroom, and this old guy I catch looking  at me, and I feel him looking down at my mule, which was probably 21 and eager and a high-energy  comedian's little eager dick.  And he's looking, and I just kind of look over at him, and he goes, that's quite a pretty  one, and I'm like, uh, thank you, and I just zipped up and walked out.  Quite a pretty one.  Exactly the words he used.  Yeah, happened to me one time in London, England, right at, uh... 
[01:10:00]  That's a fat country, anyway.  Yeah, but, you know, right by the palace, I went downstairs to use the bathroom, I walked  in, and, you know, I stepped up to the euro, and I pulled it out, and as soon as I pulled  it out, I felt the eyes, like, to the left and to the right of me.  Oh, boy.  And I just kind of looked to the right, and I saw this guy just jerking his cock looking at  me, and I'm like, oh, this is bad.  Yeah, it's jolly good twigs and berries, eh?  Yeah, yeah.  What'd you do?  Do you mind if I wank off here? 
[01:10:30]  Anthony?  Steve's got some good news.  Oh.  Our good friend John has arrived with a jar of cherries.  Oh, we got the cherries.  He's looking more and more like your brother every day, too.  I mean, what is going on?  I would like to comment on John's fantastic shoes as well.  Oh, wow.  And he's got the flame boots.  Flaming footwear.  He's wearing the flaming boots.  Very popular.  Exactly.  And the cherries are ice cold.  Really?  Yeah.  Courtesy of the Hard Rock Cafe here in New York City?  Cherries for you. 
[01:11:00]  Thank you.  About a block away, Anthony, from where we broadcast?  Moving to Times Square, selling out like everyone else, right?  Yeah.  Great.  Okay.  Where's Kenny?  We want him on the air.  Keith needs to go down for Kenny to come up.  Oh, yeah.  We got to talk to the club.  Oh, they're in shifts.  They're good, right?  Sex Bagel, why don't you, we need another report from the sidewalk after the break,  so why don't you go down there as well?  We're going to take a break here, Anthony.  I think we got the Police Got My Car thing all figured out finally.  Did they?  Brother Joe's Christmas song.  We're going to try it again here, I think. 
[01:11:30]  And, yeah, we'll continue in a bit.  Hey, man, you want to go out and get a beer and burn one or something?  I can't, man.  The police, they got my car.  What do you mean the police got your car?  Just what I said.  The police got my car.  The police got your car?  You stupid-ass, the police, they got my car.

I never did like breaking up with people.  And I guess everybody here is broken up with somebody,  and we've all heard the breakup lines.  There's a million of them.  I was picking out a few of my favorites. 
[01:15:00]  Like, I need some space, which is half a sentence.  The rest of it is without you in it.  I think my all-time favorite, I think we should start seeing other people.  Trust me, nobody's ever said that one to you without having somebody else in mind.  Guys, if a woman says to you, I think we should start seeing other people,  trust me, she has already cut a pony from the herd,  and if she ain't riding him yet, she has pulled the saddle out of the barn. 
[01:15:30]  What else is going on?  What about the 70s?  What about what, what were you, you tell me, what were you doing in the moment, I was saying.  Since the shit just hits you.  What about the 70s?  Because this damn show ain't Ricky Lake, so.  What about the 70s?  And when people started growing their hair, and then. 
[01:16:00]  What do you want to know about the 70s?  The 70s was a cool time, I think.  70s, I mean, I was a young boy, so, you know, going through my trials, my tribulations,  but I think they were cool.  I think people were together at that time.  You know, you got together, had your little drink on,  you could party like a motherfucker, chill, you know, everybody had their shit.  Now everybody got attitude.  Nobody don't really respect nobody.  You know, you get on the dance floor, you scared to bump into a motherfucker.

You hear the sweeper coming back into break?  I didn't.  We really want more women listening to this program.  We're not making it easy on the women. 
[01:18:00]  This is the O&A virus spreading across America.  We got a madhouse today.  It's a madhouse.  Last report, about 100 people outside the studio coming and going.  Only 25 are coming up to do the cherry darts for the MiFi, the portable XM radio.  How are they choosing?  Well, the first 25, we said.  So I guess they got that figured out already.  And the other people just want to hang out and party down there.  Yes.  I got quality control. 
[01:18:30]  Speaking of women, you should have seen what I just brought yous.  What did you just brought yous?  A hot chick.  Thank you, Kenny.  I don't fool around.  I know you don't.  But do you have to say they're fucking hot right in front of their faces?  Because they don't really know how to respond to that.  You might want to be a little more subtle.  They can take a compliment.  They don't know if they want to kick you in the balls and go,  Oh, thank you.  I appreciate that.  You know, you're quite attractive. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  Something like that.  No, that's the, like anybody could say that.  True.  Do you want some ribs, Kenny?  Maybe later.  They're good.  Kenny, where were you?  Anthony and I already ate the ribs from the listeners.  Usually you frown upon that.  I know, I know.  But they look quite enticing.  That one slab over there, I'm sure it tastes delicious, but it looks like roadkill a little bit. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  Well, they had a microwave on them.  They've been cooking all night.  They've been outside on the sidewalk.  You know, on the sidewalk.  Pretty much.  And you know, they put them right by their feet in the little styrofoam.  They were probably smoking and drinking and coughing over them.  Now, they weren't holding them the whole time.  Not in a bag.  So they put them down.  Yeah.  And have you ever walked the streets of Manhattan at night and into the morning?  Have you seen the size of the cockroaches that walk around?  Oh, yeah.  Could you imagine one crawling his little Manhattan, New York feet over the top of them in the bag? 
[01:20:00]  Every morning it's an adventure.  You see the cockroaches.  You see rats.  You see puke.  Yeah.  More than once.  You see the vomit.  You see couples having sex.  I haven't seen that lately, but you see the couples having sex.  I play vomit hopscotch on my way into work.  You've got to kind of hop over the little puddles and pools.  We've said this a few times.  It's like walking through Ben's house.  Yeah.  Where is Ben?  Ben's on his way.  He should be here.  I'm so excited to see Ben for the first time in two days.  It was insane.  Dude, I've got to tell you. 
[01:20:30]  No joke.  It was just unbelievable.  Well, we're in a bad sushi.  It's going to be all herky and enjoying it.  It was crazy.  Insane.  Insane.  Nuts.  So, for the pervs out there, if you want to see couples having sex, it's between 4.30 and 5.  The bars have been closed for about an hour.  And, you know, first they go back to the car, listen to some music, maybe smoke some tree.  And right around 5 o'clock, it's time to have some sex.  Yeah.  I've seen three so far.  Yeah. 
[01:21:00]  Three different cars bouncing with the foggy windows.  It's hilarious.  Was it consensual sex?  Yes, it was, Kenny.  Sure.  We've got to check in with Sex Bagel.  He's on the sidewalk.  Basically, we're waiting for the porn stars to show up to start the Cherry Dart competition,  Anthony, for the MyFi.  Sex Bagel.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  What's going on?  You know how our building is located midway between 6th and 7th?  Yeah.  The line is almost at, actually, no, it is.  It's at 6th Avenue. 
[01:21:30]  So we covered half the block already with people waiting to come up to do Cherry Darts.  Nice.  They understand only 25 are going to be able to come up, though, right?  Yes.  They've been trying to bribe Master Poe, Kenny, Keith, myself, with any way possible to get up here.  They've got food.  They've got money.  They've got alcohol.  They've got other things that they've been offering.  And they're trying to do anything.  Everybody wants these MyFives.  Very cool.  And all right.  Anything crazy going on down there, though? 
[01:22:00]  One listener brought their big blue cargo van that they just covered in WoW stickers themselves.  And they're blasting the XM right here on 57th for everyone to hear the show.  Oh, nice.  There's a couple of other girls that were standing in line.  One of the girls didn't realize that she didn't have to stand in line.  She's one of the ladies who will be entertaining us tonight with the Cherry Darts.  So we pulled her out of line.  She was standing in line.  And I had no idea.  Her name was Candy.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, she was the one that's going to be the target.  And she was waiting in line. 
[01:22:30]  Well, she's dumb and she's blonde.  I mean, she was out there smoking.  And I said, are you here to participate?  She goes, no, no.  I'm the target.  So I said, oh, you don't have to stand in line.  So Johnny from the Hard Rock is keeping her company over on the side there.  Why don't you announce to the crowd that that's the target and see what they say?  Oh, yeah.  The one?  I'm sorry?  Why don't you announce to the crowd that that's the target and point to her and see what they say?  Okay.  Hey, everybody.  I know you're ready.  It's cold.  But when you come inside, the lucky ones who get picked, this young lady right here is the target. 
[01:23:00]  This is who you'll be doing the Cherry Darts for.  What do you think of her?  What do you think of her, man?  Yeah, that bitch rocks.  Yeah, that bitch rocks.  Slow-talking son of a bitch.  Everyone's going nuts now.  They're trying to get a look at her.  All right, good.  She's waving.  And we found another female contestant on the line here.  Oh, cool. 
[01:23:30]  So maybe later you want to bring her up, too.  Well, I think we're going to start the Cherry Darts within 15 minutes.  If we've got one of the targets here, we can start.  We absolutely can.  All right, we'll bring her up, and then we'll start the process of getting some of these guys up there.  All right, I think we'll have five heats.  Five guys per heat.  Right.  Five.  Okay.  And, no, you don't have to listen to that, Eric.  Thank you.  All right, bye.  And then maybe we should have a winner per heat, and then those five will be in the finals.  Kind of like that's the semifinals.  Yeah.  You're already in the semifinals when you get in. 
[01:24:00]  Right.  When you get in, you're automatically in.  So you're a winner right away.  You know what annoys me?  What?  That Eric's name.  Sex Bagel?  I don't like it.  I don't understand it.  Where did that come from?  We've never explained.  You have to, like...  He was working on a wacky radio show, and they named him Sex Bagel.  So maybe we just rename him.  It's probably something he got caught doing.  Yeah, like what?  No, it's actually a boring story.  It has nothing to do with anything.  When he comes up here, we'll ask him.  There has to be a story behind a name like that. 
[01:24:30]  We'll ask him.  He told me once, and I don't remember, because it was just like, all right, whatever.  You know what it is?  There's...  The type of guy he is, and his personality, and the way he looks, there's nothing in there  that should have, like, the sex thing in there.  You don't think he gives off sex appeal?  Personally, no.  I don't think he does.  I'm not even going that far.  I'm just saying, you know, it's not...  I don't know what he gives off.  But it's not...  That just doesn't seem to be a name that fits him.  Right.  And it just disturbs me when people call him that. 
[01:25:00]  What should we call him?  Eric, perhaps?  Nice boy.  It's just...  Anthony, on the instant feedback, Tom from Eric.  Yeah, Anthony, you better bring those guys in from the line soon before someone from the  Tony Danza show shows up with a cell phone.  Yeah, what a difference.  Touché.  What a difference shows make.  Oh, you don't get that on the Tony Danza line?  No.  Tony, we were outside drinking whiskey, smoking pot, and we brought you some ribs.  Hey, thoughts and prayers, all right?  All right? 
[01:25:30]  Hey, you're pretty fucked up out there right here, huh?  Yeah.  Two different worlds.  What can I tell you?  Absolutely.  Hey, we're going to bring you in, and you're going to throw cherries at girls' asses, okay?  It's going to be fun.  Thoughts and prayers.  Out to everybody.  And my daughter's going to be one of the targets.  You know, my beautiful daughter is coming in, and it's going to be harassed.  Throwing cherries at.  Yeah, quite the difference.  You guys want to say hi to Master Poe?  He's smiling a little bit today. 
[01:26:00]  Is he in better shape?  Kenny, you've got to get him in shape for us.  He's eating ribs right now.  He's a little angry.  Yeah.  Kenny, you want to hear some of your theme songs that we're going to pick from?  Okay.  More are coming in, but you need a theme song.  Thank you.  And, you know, we're working off the whole big and stupid thing.  Why not?  How does that go again?  I think you sing, I think you should just sing your own theme song.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, let's hear what you got.  All right, this is chemistry. 
[01:26:30]  But don't use clubby.  Okay.  Yeah, clubby's a little clubby.  A little light in the loafers?  Yeah, a little bit.  A little sweet in the pants.  You do have that 70s porno mustache, so we're starting to wonder about you, bro.  How about we call you a clubby bagel?  Here's chemistry from whackbag.com.  Here comes Buck to the Kenny.  Thank you.  Yo, dog.  Yo.  He's big and he's stupid.  Big and he's stupid. 
[01:27:00]  Yo.  He's big and he's stupid.  Big and he's stupid.  Yo, dog.  Up to the Kenny.  Yo.  He's big and he's stupid.  He's big and he's stupid.  Yo, dog.  He's big and he's stupid.  I am enamored with you.  It's kind of weird.  I like it.  It's too long.  I kind of like the fact that he incorporated your actual lyrics in there.  Yeah. 
[01:27:30]  That was very creative of him.  You were singing it?  It's got to be short, though, because every time Kenny calls, you can't have that long.  Yeah, big, long thing.  Yeah.  I'm not jealous.  Well, we could have a song about Club Soda Kenny and then we need the actual theme music.  The theme.  So there's two things going on.  All right.  And then we got Pappy.  He came up with one.  Pappy.  Pappy, I think, did one of the Monster Rain songs, if I'm not mistaken.  Oh, yeah.  The first one.  One of the better ones, yes.  Here's Pappy.  Oh, stupid and graceful, related to Shrek.  Club Soda Kenny is handsome as heck. 
[01:28:00]  Prancing and skipping like a little ass.  But if you try to put him down, he'll make you crap your pants.  Oh, Kenny is snappy, well-mannered, and how?  Well, razor-sharp wit behind a dim-witted frown.  Uncomfortable feelings when his antics abound.  Clubby is over him now.  Oh, that guy did a great job also.  Wow, he really captured your essence. 
[01:28:30]  Do you like that one, Kenny?  Wow.  I'm overwhelmed.  He put Clubby in there, too.  Yeah.  Holy mackerel.  That's good.  Was that an accordion he was playing for?  Yeah.  Well, it works with the Big and Stupid, I think.  Yeah.  Using the odd couple Happy, Peppy, and Bursting with Love song.  Ah, yes.  Yeah.  Just slow it down.  Happy and Peppy.  Happy.  Jay wants in.  Jay, what's up?  It's the J.P. Morgan episode, I believe. 
[01:29:00]  Jay, go ahead.  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey.  I want to know, who the hell is this Club Soda Kenny guy?  Is he supposed to be funny?  He's not funny, but we don't know how to tell him that he's not funny,  because he's 6'5 and a martial arts expert.  Is he a comedian?  He's more of just a guy who takes good care of us.  He's just some, like, weird guy that just hangs around with you guys?  Yeah, and we don't know how to tell him to go away.  We don't know how to tell him to go away.  He's 6'5.  He's security.  Hey, Kenny.  Yes, sir? 
[01:29:30]  Kenny.  Yes, sir?  Speak.  He hung up on you.  He got you.  He got you really bad.  No, he was scared to talk to me.  That's his problem.  You think that was it, or you think he's laughing?  Yeah, no, because I had a thing or two to say to him,  and he hung up, because that's what he did.  Okay.  Now we got the Club Soda Kenny theme song from Dan.  Dan Colby from, wow, St. Catharines.  Oh, okay.  Is that Canada?  Yeah, it's from Canada.  An altar boy?  He's an altar boy?  No, it's from Canada. 
[01:30:00]  You know where Canada is?  Oh, Club Soda Kenny.  He's big and he's stupid.  Oh, Club Soda Kenny.  Where today's Club Soda Kenny gets high on you.  Rush?  I understand.  I'm trying to think of other Canadian bands.  There was Kim Mitchell.  Exactly.  Club Soda Kenny better keep your head.  Was he from Canada? 
[01:30:30]  Oh, Neil Young.  I got it.  I got the Neil Young.  Very good.  And I guess it ends there.  Pretty much.  That's what Canada gave us.  I can remember a Brian Adams song.  You gave us Neil Young, Brian Adams, and Rush.  Thanks.  That's not a bad little threesome.  So here's Dan.  Club Soda Kenny has beautiful eyes.  He skips like a girl and probably cries.  He's big and he's stupid, but he's one of the guys.  He's Club Soda Kenny.  Club Soda Kenny. 
[01:31:00]  Club Soda Kenny.  I like his guitar playing prowess.  There's four versions of this?  What?  I think you only need one version of that.  Yeah.  He skips like a girl and he probably cries.  Quarantine thinks he's got beautiful eyes.  He's big and he's stupid, but he's one of the guys.  He's Club Soda Kenny.  Club Soda Kenny.  He's just like strumming an open guitar.  Yeah.  Is that what he's doing?  And doing kind of a sling blade voice? 
[01:31:30]  Here's the third version.  He skips like a girl and he probably cries.  Quarantine thinks he's got beautiful eyes.  He's big and he's stupid, but he's one of the guys.  He's Club Soda Kenny.  Club Soda Kenny.  What's different about these versions?  Nothing.  It's kind of catchy, though.  Catchy?  Yeah, it's a little catchy.  Like food poisoning.  No, you got to give the guy an A for effort.  You do?  Yeah.  Yeah, he tried. 
[01:32:00]  What's this show you just think of?  Quarantine thinks he's got beautiful eyes.  He skips like a girl and he probably cries.  He's big and he's stupid, but he's one of the guys.  He's Club Soda Kenny.  Club Soda Kenny.  Hey, and he probably likes french fried potatoes.  And fixing on mowers.  All right, well.  That's what we got so far.  That guy's got to drink some mule juice to straighten out that gravel voice he's got. 
[01:32:30]  Make it a little smoother and silkier.  That's really bad.  But no, I appreciate all those songs from all those listeners.  Thank you.  I really appreciate it.  Very good.  All right.  Thank you, Kenny.  Club Soda Kenny, everyone.  You want to see that chick I brought you?  I see her.  The blonde?  The tall blonde?  She's very, very hot.  Forget the ribs.  She's good eats.  Lovely.  She's very lovely.  She's good eats.  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  She got like fishnet stockings on.  She got like a little dong. 
[01:33:00]  A little dong thing?  Dressed all sexy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's like six foot tall.  Blonde hair on her head.  You're so big and you're so stupid.  That's no secret.  It's perfect for you.  And it's got beautiful eyes.  All right.  All right.  Oh, where's sex bagel?  Come in here for a second.  I think Joe is here with, I'm guessing, with one of the gals.  Oh.  Oh, really?  I'll have to go on that stuff.  Are we just about ready? 
[01:33:30]  The studio doesn't look ready for cherry darts.  We've got to move the lesbian couch for the day.  We're waiting for you to go to break and we'll have it all set up.  Okay.  A lot of people want to know why sex bagel.  Yeah.  Where did that ridiculous name come from?  I don't think we ever explained it on the radio.  Oh, it's a stupid story.  It's pretty geeky.  Yeah.  I think we're going to rename you.  That's fine.  If you want to do that.  We're going to rename you or something.  I've been using that name since 97 anyway, so it's probably...  Since 97.  97, everybody.  Something more masculine, like Robert Reed's Balloon Nuts.  So what's the story behind sex bagel? 
[01:34:00]  While I was at college in Pennsylvania, there was a local shit station.  I was working the nighttime shift, and these two guys after me doing the late night wanted  to be lovelines so bad.  Yeah.  These two dumb rednecks.  And the PD said, well, one of them can't come in that night.  Can you run the board?  Fine.  I ran the board, but I wouldn't talk because I just didn't like their show.  And the one host kept trying to get me to do sex advice.  You wouldn't talk?  I don't believe it already.  No.  You don't know when to shut up.  And I were discussing that again today. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, my God.  That topic comes up a lot.  Eric just enjoys talking to everybody.  He's very excited to be here.  I can't, but I can't fault the guy that he's working for two guys that have been doing  this for 10 years and just want to collect a paycheck and get the hell out of the business.  I understand.  He's the young go-getter.  I remember being like him.  Yeah, back in the old days.  No, we're just kidding, Eric.  Relax.  So what happened?  So the guy kept trying to get me to do sex advice.  And what do I know? 
[01:35:00]  So I wasn't going to do anything.  Caller came in late towards the end of the show.  Some female finally asked.  So I said, I forgot what the question was, but I gave her advice.  She's like, oh, that's really good.  By the way, you know, when you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea.  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener.  Yeah, I talk too much, but I also listen too much, too.  He's the genuine article.  Yeah, you are the genuine article.  Let me tell you something.  I like me.  My wife likes me. 
[01:35:30]  My customers like me.  I'm the genuine article.  With his stupid perm and stupid mustache.  Go on, hurt me.  I'm an easy target.  Yeah, go on, hurt me.  The fat head just shaking.  Doesn't he say, if it makes you feel better, go ahead, man.  Go ahead and hurt me.  I'm an easy target.  That's another must-watch movie.  Playing trains and automobiles.  Oh, it's brilliant.  So what were you saying?  You haven't been home in eight years.  Yeah.  So anyway, so the guy was trying to be funny.  He wanted to say sex advice from the bagel, because, you know, my last name rhymes with  bagel.  And he goes, oh, what happened? 
[01:36:00]  Oh, look at it.  All right.  So he goes, advice from the sex bagel, and then he just thought it was funny, so he kept  calling me that for months, and then everyone else-  You thought it was funny because you use it now.  Well, I just wound up using it because everyone called me it.  So I had it by default, and then I just kept using it.  All right.  All right.  You're right, Opie.  It was a stupid story.  Something cooler.  How about one of five busted in Paramus?  That's a little bit of a cooler.  We got to get that other line from Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, where he's doing  the caddy doll or whatever it is.  You probably pull your own string. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  Fat guy in a motel room who just wants to sleep and have friends.  All right.  I like the end of that movie, when he watches Steve Martin and his wife kissing, and his  little fat hands are just in his hat.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a really great shot.  It's sad.  Yeah.  I love that movie.  Stupid wife went and died.  All right.  Thank you, Eric.  Very good.  I guess we have to go to break then so we can get the studio set up for cherry darts, huh?  Yeah.  Let's get the festivities underway. 
[01:37:00]  What would you like me to do?  Leave the studio.  Okay.  He is big.  And he's stupid, man.  Yeah, but I know how to take orders.  That's right.  He's Sex Bagel Kenny.  Is Master Pro okay?  Yeah.  He could learn a thing or two from you.  He's having a good time for himself.  Yeah.  No, he's too intense.  See, you take care of business, but you do it with a smile.  Right.  When you're breaking someone's neck, you're smiling at them. 
[01:37:30]  Well, that's the difference between me and him.  He's intense.  Yeah, he is wrapped very tight, but you know, you got to give him credit.  He does his job very well, but...  The last thing you see before you're being choked out is Kenny, like, smiling down at you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is that big head just smiling at you?  He slams your head on the curb a few times, and then he skips away.  Yeah.  Service with a smile.  Imagine just as it...  He skips down the sidewalk.  As you're fading out, 99.  Like, ah, everything goes gray. 
[01:38:00]  Good night.  One thing, though, Master Po really is dedicated to you guys, so you got to give him...  No, we like him for that.  We're just trying to loosen him up a little bit, because we have to work every day with  him, and we just want him to smile a little bit.  Right.  Well, he'll...  That's all.  He'll get more comfortable.  He's convinced that commandos are coming through the windows or something.  Yeah.  And he's prepared for it.  He's prepared for everything.  Ready to come down.  Repel down the side of the building and smash through the glass.  By the way, when does the couple have sex across the way? 
[01:38:30]  I'm really pissed off at that yesterday.  We heard about that yesterday.  Yeah, exactly.  You know that there's a couple...  You see that little apartment right there with the balcony?  Out across 57th.  It's got a balcony.  50 feet away from us.  We could see it clear as day.  I guess, like, the behind-the-scenes staff, they've noticed that a couple has sex every  morning, and then the girl walks around with little panties and stuff, and they forgot  to tell us.  They didn't forget.  They just didn't want us to mention it on the air and spoil it.  Yeah.  I don't think they got the XM over there yet.  You never know.  Yeah, who knows?  Okay.  Young couple...  Yeah, you guys are very popular. 
[01:39:00]  Sexy active.  Everybody got XM to listen to you guys.  Well, every day they are getting their units, so...  Yeah.  Do you forget how talented you people are?  Well, tell us, Kenny.  I have forgotten, actually.  Well, besides your striking looks, you guys are very funny.  That's what I say.  Thank you, Kenny.  That's it? 
[01:39:30]  Well, you know, I can only put a couple sentences together at a time.  You gotta give me...  You're stupid.  I gotta think about it.  You're stupid.  All right.  Well, listen to this as we go to break.  It's a holiday.  Classic, Anthony.  After this...  He did get you.  You got me?  Yeah.  I gotta run.  I gotta run.  I gotta run. 
[01:40:00]  Don't ihre.  I gotta run.  Don't fuck up raising.  Hop tugboat.  They really heard me.  So do skin dressed.  Whoosh is like an apple fire?  Would you like an apple fire?  Whoosh is like an apple fire?  Whoosh is like an apple fire?  Where is the bell?  Wait for the bell?  Can I hear the bell?  Where is the bell?  Ding, fauna j分享!  Ding, fauna jilation!  I cheek a boogie king.  Making favorite war conflicts.  I would pay for hats. 
[01:40:30]  Whoosh is like an apple fire?  Whoosh is like an apple fire?  Whoosh is like an apple fire?  Whoosh is like an apple fire?  Whoosh is like an apple fire?  The very worst of the Opie and Anthony F.U. Life.  This is Adam from New York. Master Poe is a bitch.  If he was such a fucking badass and so much worried about litigation,  he wouldn't threaten you guys in your own studio.  Fuck you, Master Poe, you fucking pussy.  You are a fucking cocksucker.  I'll tell you what, you fucking would lose your job 
[01:41:00]  if you fucking stepped to either one of those guys,  and if you're so fucking worried about litigation, you quit.  So go fuck yourself and show your fucking ass where you belong.  This fuck you goes out to all those asshole-warned DJs  that make those whack-ass lame mashups.  They stink!  They'd like to send a big F.U. out to the tippy-com  for ruining a fucking show.  Fuck you, tippy-com.  And I know I'm not the only one to say it,  but I'd like to send a big old fuck you out to Howard Stern. 
[01:41:30]  I know I'm a truck driver,  and all the time you hear these people on there  are just trying to cause trouble by getting,  you know, getting people pissed off,  and they just get on their holler,  Baba Booey, Baba Booey, Baba Booey.  Well, I think Gopi and Anthony have done more than enough  to blow Howard out of the fucking water, so...  I think all those guys need to start hollerin'  Baba Boo Hoo instead.  Poor son of a bitch.  Howard, you suck.  Fuck you.  This is all you pencil-pushing motherfuckers  out there to keep passing truck drivers.  Y'all think it's such an easy job.  Y'all pack your shit, come on. 
[01:42:00]  It's not a fucking world.  Don't get off of it.  Fuck you.  I would like to send out a big F-you  to all you unblown-up,  popping-up motherfuckers.  Take them down.  Put them away.  You don't have to set them up in a room,  in a carpeted room,  and stupid fucking people.  It's water, let it go.  Put it on brown lip long.  Don't fucking put it in my way.  F-you, yes.  And you're all women, too.  F-you.  Fuck all you.  Call the Opie and Anthony F-U line

I got a nine-pound ball,  and, well, I got some eight-pound balls,  but they don't have any fingers in them.  You know, you can't have any holes drilled in them yet.  You can actually throw it,  you know, without a finger hole if you want to.  Okay, okay, let's start over. 
[01:44:00]  But I've got the nine-pound.  So, let's start over.  Do you have eight-pound balls?  I've got some eight-pound balls,  but I don't have them drilled yet.  I got some two-lbs.  Do you say yes or no?  Yes or no.  I've got eight-pound balls, yeah,  but they're not drilled yet.  Just say yes or no.  Do you have eight-pound balls?  Well, can you understand English or not?  I said I have some brand-new eight-pound balls  that don't have finger holes drilled.  But we're just asking you, 
[01:44:30]  say yes or no.  We don't care about the holes.  Oh, yes, I have three of them, yeah.  Then where do you buy your underwear?  You suck.  You jerk.  What's the definition of making love?  That's what a woman's doing  while a guy's fucking her. 
[01:45:00]  Why do women have two sets of lips?  So they can piss and moan.  The greatest thing being  when the ladies moan at the joke.  That's okay.  A couple wakes up one morning.  The wife says,  I had a dream last night.  It was Christmas.  And the tree was decorated with penises. 
[01:45:30]  Long ones, short ones,  black ones, white ones,  circumcised, uncircumcised.  At the top of the tree  was the perfect penis.  The husband says,  is that mine?  She says,  no, yours was being hid  by one of those little lights.  This is what I had to dream myself.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Christmas time.  This tree was decorated with vaginas. 
[01:46:00]  Little ones, big ones.  Bushy ones.  Shaved ones.  And at the top of the tree  was the perfect vagina.  She said, was that mine?  He says, no,  they were using yours  as the tree stand.  How do you turn a fox  into a cow?  Marry her.  Can you say fuck on this channel? 
[01:46:30]  Oh, Jesus.  That's shocking.  Holy fuck, I need coffee.  Do you have an Audi?  This is the best show ever.  The OB and Anthony show.  One, two, three,  go.  Ah, we're just moments away  from starting the Cherry Darts  competition, Anthony. 
[01:47:00]  The porn stars are here.  The cherries are here.  The cool whip is here.  The listeners are here.  Oh, yeah, look at the girls.  They're here.  Very good.  We have a MiFi to give away  to the winner of the Cherry Darts  competition today.  I think we're giving away  another MiFi.  You and I  and the rest of the crew  will be throwing Cherry Darts  for listeners  all over the country.  Yes.  We'll be representing people  from all over the country.  That's going to be  later on in the program. 
[01:47:30]  They're setting up  the microphones.  They've got the tarp out.  They've moved  the lesbian couch.  Very good.  Looking real good  in here right now.  I want everybody to know  so they can refer to me  on the instant feedback  and message boards.  I am no longer  a sorcerer, Opie.  I did my wizard quest  last night  and I am now a wizard, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's obsessed with EverQuest.  EverQuest 2. 
[01:48:00]  EQ2, right?  EQ2.  Yeah.  EQ2.  I was a sorcerer  as you all know.  Sure.  What the hell  is a sorcerer, by the way?  A sorcerer?  I'm a caster.  I cast spells of...  Is that good  to be a sorcerer?  Well, there's all kinds  of things you can be.  You could be a regular fighter  where you just...  What's the worst thing  you could be  in EverQuest 2?  You know, every character  has their strengths  and you're all kind of  needed in the community.  I cast spells of heat and cold. 
[01:48:30]  I use, you know,  the powers of the elements.  Ah.  And I...  Yeah, I blast you.  Funny, Steve only casts  spells of heat.  Spells of heat.  I cast a spell on his hat  and look, it's on fire.  How powerful I am  as a wizard.  There is the heat miser himself  getting the studio  ready for cherry darts.  You'll hear that  in the background.  But Anthony and I  are true professionals  and we can talk  and do radio.  Of course.  Even with all these  distractions around us.  The ribs smelling nice,  the drunks outside the studio,  porn stars already  walking around naked.  We're impervious  to distractions.  Just a lovely, 
[01:49:00]  lovely scene here today.  Mm-hmm.  Okay, so you're...  Yes, so last night  I had to do...  That's why I'm a little tired.  I might have stayed up  a little later  than I would have normally.  I had to go out  and gather some precious gems  from the gnolls of Blackborough,  Opie,  and bring them back  to the Madge Tower  in South Kinos  where I handed them in  and was given the test.  I had to defeat  some elemental beasts  in the tower,  four of them,  which I defeated. 
[01:49:30]  So there's five of you  in total.  Maybe sword fighting  in a Sears restroom.  Yeah.  Yeah, did you get arrested  for this mission?  And your name's  in the paper today?  You're sick after?  You can be a wizard  or a 73-year-old doctor.  I think I'd rather be  whacking in the bathroom  with the old guys  than doing what you're  describing here.  I think you misunderstand.  If you move  to the next level,  you have to dock  with the older gentleman  at the restroom.  What is wrong with you?  I was finishing 
[01:50:00]  my wizard quest.  You do realize  you're an adult now, right?  I do.  Okay.  I was very happy.  I killed off the last one,  the Earth Elemental,  and I went back  to the quest giver  and I got my new  wizard staff.  My new wizard staff  for kicking ass.  I'm very happy about that.  Now I'm a wizard,  so don't refer to me  anymore as a sorcerer.  I am indeed  a wizard now.  Ah.  Everquest 2.  I smell my Pop-Tarts.  Where are they?  Oh, they're done. 
[01:50:30]  Boss wants the Pop-Tarts.  I thought Jimmy's farts  were getting sweet.  They smell really good.  I want to bite into  that delicious goodness.  How do I get  this goodness in me?  Yeah, Brian Regan  will be on the show  next week.  Yes.  We should start  promoting our guests  instead of them  just popping up.  People are like,  dude, if I knew  Larry the Cable Guy  was going to be  on your show,  I would have told  all my friends to listen.  How about Lynch?  Is he coming in  and also Sully?  We're going to have  a lot of guests next week  because we're doing  that free play thing  for XM Saturday Radio  where everyone  will get a chance 
[01:51:00]  to check out the show  if they have  XM Saturday Radio.  Are we loading it up?  We're going to load up  the show next week.  We're going to give them  some good shows.  What's wrong, Eric?  Full seven cents worth?  They're burnt?  Son of a bitch.  I'm going to go  get you new ones.  Oh, God.  Somebody.  Why did you have to get them?  Oh, God.  You burnt this fucking Pop-Tart.  If you're going to get  Pop-Tarts,  don't pull them off  a plane in Colorado.  I set it for a minute  30 on the toaster  and the thing just  didn't turn itself off.  Everyone knows  you only cook Pop-Tarts  for a minute,  not a minute 30.  They just have to be  heated, not cooked. 
[01:51:30]  What the hell?  Who did this?  Who did it?  I just put it in the oven.  I turned it to a minute 30.  That would be you.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, my God.  Throwing that hot filling.  It would explode like napalm  and just stick to his  boyish sex bagel flesh.  Running nude down the street  covered in napalm.  Now you know why I said  where are my Pop-Tarts?  I smell them burning.  Yeah.  I thought I was going to  save them in time.  I got to tell you,  in all my years,  I have never seen  burnt Pop-Tarts.  I think the Virgin Mary's  face is in one of them.  Oh, wait.  Look at that.  People just don't burn Pop-Tarts. 
[01:52:00]  Get this up on eBay  immediately.  You just heat them up.  No, no Virgin Mary's  in these.  Jesus.  That does look like  a balloon knot, though.  Scrape the burn off  with a knife.  I know.  Come on.  All right.  So you're doing well  with each of you, too.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Very proud that I am  now a wizard.  I've been doing a lot  of battling in Blackboro.  The Knolls of Blackboro.  The Knolls of Blackboro.  Ah, yes. 
[01:52:30]  Very hard to defeat.  I thought you moved  back to Brooklyn.  It's the Lords of Flatbush.  Oh, you remember that?  Henry Winkler and Stallone?  Stallone was in there.  You know, there's a lot  of paperwork that you  have to fill out  just to enter the studio  these days.  I don't know why,  and Master Poe  takes it very seriously.  We do a credit check  on people.  I see one of the porn stars  who's very lovely,  very blonde,  very hot,  and she's got a pen  in her hand  and all the paperwork  in front of her.  I'm not lying.  She's looking around  for help.  Yeah.  There, she's waving  at us now.  She's looking around 
[01:53:00]  for help like,  what does that mean?  Well, that's your  birth name?  It's Phil and Namé.  Right.  She's having trouble.  Namé.  So, what's going on  with one of the porn stars?  She wants to blow  a midget or something?  Here's the thing.  Candy, she's very attractive.  She has a weird,  joke a lot,  the director has told me  that she's going to do  a porn she wants  to do with midgets.  She has like a real  midget fetish.  A midget fetish.  Well, we have a midget fetish  on this show  so I think we can get  together on this one.  And she really wants  to do a midget. 
[01:53:30]  Really?  And I was thinking,  I don't know if I should,  my idea was  how fantastic that would be  to have in studio.  Yes.  To have her perform  whatever type of thing  she desires on maybe a midget  and maybe we have  a lucky midget listener  Yeah.  come in here  but in order to qualify  if you're a midget  you have to show up  wearing an elf costume  or some other  indicative of your height wear.  How fantastic would it be  to watch a midget  being fellated? 
[01:54:00]  It would be amazing.  Wouldn't it?  Yeah.  It would be great.  Oh man,  I'm trying to find out  the midget song.  Little bells jingling  as he shivers.  Yeah,  he has to keep the hat  on the whole time.  Jingle, jingle.  Little feet sticking  straight out.  Oh,  with the curly shoes on.  Yeah.  Little curly shoes.  Yeah.  Just kind of humiliated  in his child-sized outfit.  With his fat ass  and his normal man-sized cock  and the rest of his  genetically deformed  awful body.  Oh,  those little Vienna  sausage fingers  on the back of her head 
[01:54:30]  pushing.  Yeah.  We're trying to.  They're actually  on her cheekbones  pulling.  But they can't reach  the back of her head.  Can't reach the back  of her head.  He's got them  locked into her fucking  into her cheeks  like a fish  just pulling them down.  Nubby padded hands.  Yeah.  Like a muffin.  Like a Kaiser roll fist  with little Vienna sausages  sticking out of them.  Puffy,  puffy paws.  Just soft.  You only want to stick  a pin in it  and watch the air go 
[01:55:00]  and pop out of those  fat Ghostbuster hands.  Little whoopee  cushioned palms.  Oh,  they really are awful.  You really should  put a midget's hand  on a seat  and somebody sits on it.  As the air rushes  out of those  five tiny little fingers.  Make sure they're  not frosted.  What flavor?  Brown sugar.  Now he's got to go out  and get more Pop-Tarts.  We're too busy.  Don't worry about the Pop-Tarts.  Someone should,  if you want your Pop-Tarts,  you're not going to find  brown sugar,  non-frosted Pop-Tarts 
[01:55:30]  anywhere in this area.  No, you won't.  No, you won't.  You won't?  No, he's,  I mean,  did Ben show up?  No.  No, Ben hasn't gotten here yet.  So we're short-staffed.  Don't worry about my Pop-Tarts.  Maybe we could do  a Pop-Tart throw  instead of cherry.  Maybe if one of those  guys out there  has food that we could eat,  by the way.  They all brought food,  but none of it  is making its way up here  except for the ribs.  Hey guys,  bring phones and computers.  That would have been nice.  Apparently,  they're showing up today.  The phones and computers  are awesome.  Can you take that  out of your ear, please?  What about some food  that we could eat? 
[01:56:00]  I will have some food brought up.  Steve's running around  like he's Secret Service.  Relax.  It's just a girl  that's going to get  cherries thrown at her.  Got an ear plug in  and everything.  Who are you listening to  on that thing?  The phone keeps going off  every couple minutes.  So rather than  fuss with it  and put it in.  You just leave it in there  and leave it hang.  Exactly.  It's convenient.  Cool.  Thank you.  All right.  Should we bring some  of the food up here?  I think we're going to.  When, dude?  The show's half over.  Yeah, when is this  going to happen?  At 5 to 10?  I will tell Master Poe  to start.  Do you understand  that Ant and I  and Jimmy 
[01:56:30]  are just sitting here  doing what's called filler?  We're waiting for the girls.  Right.  Well, the girls,  one of them has already  filled out her paperwork  and would you like  to bring her in?  I think everyone's  so excited.  It's like we kicked  an anthill.  We keep waiting  for somebody to take charge  and just get it done.  The guy who officially  takes charge  is still dumping  and puking somewhere.  That's right.  He's in a cab  with his ass  hanging out the window.  He's got a brown sugar  Pop-Tart in his pants.  We have all the elements here.  Hot filling.  Dude, we have all the elements here  but it's like you kicked  the anthill  and now they're all just  scattering.  They're running around.  They're trying to find 
[01:57:00]  that cricket again.  It should be the organized line  with one carrying a leg,  another one,  two of them carrying that wing  with the music  all in a straight line.  Right down the hill.  Someone kicked it  and everyone's scurrying now.  They're freaking out.  Everyone's just scurrying  but they just can't figure out  how to get this together.  Can't get that cricket  back in the hole.  That's what Ben looks like  by the way.  I figured it out.  A tall midget.  Ben has a body  like a taller midget.  Maybe he can put on  the curly shoes  and little bell hats.  Dude, I'm not doing that.  It's fucking insane. 
[01:57:30]  That's crazy.  Nuts.  It's hard to return  like a little elf outfit  with shit stains in it anyway.  Speaking of midgets,  I've been waiting  for an excuse to play  Stephen Lynch's  brother's song.  Stephen Lynch has a brother  that does goof songs as well.  Is it like Gallagher too?  Yeah.  He comes out  at the end of the show  and smashes the watermelon  just like Gallagher?  I saw,  his name's Drew,  Drew Lynch.  I saw Drew warm up  for Stephen Lynch  at the downtown,  matter of fact,  on Long Island  and he played this song  for the crowd.  The crowd went  absolutely nuts. 
[01:58:00]  Absolutely nuts.  Does he do,  he writes wacky songs?  Yeah,  he does pretty much  the Stephen Lynch thing.  They're a little different.  Wait,  who came up with it first?  I don't know.  Who's the older brother?  I think Stephen.  Stephen's the older one.  Yeah.  So do you think  the younger one  kind of saw that  Stephen was doing very well  and decided to do this?  Yeah,  I guess.  It's a little weird,  I think.  This song,  I don't know,  I like it a lot.  Yeah.  It's called  Gary Foster.  Sometimes the younger sibling  does well,  sometimes not. 
[01:58:30]  Maybe Stephen Lynch's brother  will be on SNL  and they'll queue up  the wrong song.  Oh,  very good.  Yes,  yes,  I'm looking at you  showing your intelligence.  Very nice.  Not a dirty one.  Yeah,  dirty jokes.  Not all about stuff.  It's like that James,  what's his name,  Jim Belushi  doing the Blues Brothers.  Oh,  that was terrific.  Yeah.  That's like,  that to me is very weird.  I just think it's weird  that he does the same  thing as his brother.  Who are you kidding?  When you and I are gone,  our brothers will step in  and try to  continue this mess. 
[01:59:00]  Oh,  please.  That's true.  I love my brother,  but I've heard him  on the radio shows.  It's the Joe  and Brett Show.  Yeah.  Hey,  what about Darren?  He's right here.  I got a lot of brothers.  I know.  I should have said  Quinn.  It's a funnier word.  You know,  another brother.  Don't forget Scott.  I don't know Scott.  Darren,  I think,  and Brett and Quinn  are the only ones I know.  Okay,  here we go.  It's Drew Lynch  and Gary Foster.  My name is Gary Foster, 
[01:59:30]  world's greatest midget tosser.  I had a girl,  that's how I lost her.  Threw her through the bar  like a flying saucer.  Oh,  yeah. 
[02:00:00]  Oh,  yeah.  Oh,  yeah.  Oh,  yeah.  There's only one kind of girl for me.  She has to be under four foot three.  Big fat head and stubby arms. 
[02:00:30]  Smaller than the guy from the Lucky Charms.  We'll go out to dinner  and we'll go out to eat.  I'll help her fit into her booster seat.  We'll go to the beach  and we might even surf.  And I'll be her gargamel.  She'll be my smurf.  But to be my girl,  she has to sacrifice.  It might not be pleasant.  It might not be nice.  I'll be her lover. 
[02:01:00]  I'll be her man.  But she has to let me throw her  as far as I can.  Because  my name is Gary Foster.  World's greatest midget tosser.  I had a girl,  that's how I lost her.  Threw her through the bar  like a flying saucer.  Oh,  yeah.  Oh, 
[02:01:30]  yeah.  Oh,  yeah.  Oh,  yeah.  I'll make her laugh  when I joke and josh.  I'll buy her panties  at Oshkosh Pagosh.  I'll help her reach stuff  from the top shelf. 
[02:02:00]  And she'll bake me cookies  like the Keebler elf.  I'll buy her a ring  and I'll buy her a bike.  I'll scratch off the sticker  that says  Tiny Tyke.  And we'll make sweet love  whenever she likes.  And I'll stand up tall  so she can talk in the mic.  But to be my girl,  she has to sacrifice.  It might not be pleasant,  it might not be nice.  I'll be her lover,  I'll be her man. 
[02:02:30]  But she has to let me throw her  as far as I can.  Because  my name is Gary Foster,  world's greatest midget tosser.  I had a girl,  that's how I lost her.  Threw her through the bar  like a flying saucer.  Grab your midget  by the hair  and put your other hand  on her underwear. 
[02:03:00]  Then let her know  that you still care.  Then fling her,  fling her,  fling her  through the air.  My name is Gary Foster,  world's greatest midget tosser.  Let me put you  on my midget roster.  My love is so true,  so hear my offer. 
[02:03:30]  Whoa, yeah, yeah.  Steven Lynch's brother,  Drew Lynch  and Gary Foster.  I like that one.  He's a good voice.  What is all the walkie-talkies now?  I don't know.  Now I'm hearing walkie-talkies.  Dude, it's just a stupid radio thing.  This should take 15 to 20 minutes tops.  Alright, the cherries are en route.  The cherries are en route.  Clear a passageway.  It's like Secret Service out there.  Yeah.  Remember the old days  we would just do something like this? 
[02:04:00]  We needed four people.  There's probably,  I don't know,  a staff of 20  trying to figure out  how to get this  cherry darts thing done.  Can't work it out.  I've still not seen  one girl  in the studio,  one contestant  in the studio.  All I've seen so far  are the cherries.  I haven't even seen  the whipped cream.  Yeah, well we're...  Can we go bring the girl in?  Yeah.  Can we come in?  Sure.  Do we have any producers around  that know what they're doing?  Steve's running around  with his head chopped off.  Hey, Candy.  We were looking  at your pictures yesterday. 
[02:04:30]  Which ones?  Which ones?  Candy, you have to come  on the mic  so you can chit-chat a bit.  She wants to go back to bed.  She saw the couch  and started laying down.  It's a good sport.  You really are.  What's going on, Candy?  Absolutely nothing,  as a matter of fact.  You were having a problem  filling out the paperwork,  I noticed.  Yes.  What stumped you?  That was Noah's fault.  Yeah, what stumped you, though?  He was trying to  copy and paste  and it was all his fault.  I had nothing to do with it.  Yeah, okay.  Hey, Master Poe, 
[02:05:00]  is she cool enough  to come in the studio finally?  In one second.  Can you do me a favor?  Can you sign, please?  Dude, this show  has way too much red tape.  I know.  Remember the old days?  Yep.  They were just coming  off the street.  We would do whatever  we were doing  and they would leave.  We'd worry about it later.  Absolutely.  She's not signing  for an apartment.  She's signing  just to talk to us.  Sign here.  How many pages is that?  Initial, initial, sign.  I'm not kidding you. 
[02:05:30]  Initial, initial, sign.  How many times  does she have to sign?  My contract  wasn't disinvolved.  No.  Nor is it this accurate.  I haven't gotten paid yet.  Oh, no.  Master Poe,  you're kidding.  How many times  do they have to sign?  This is not even  a joke anymore.  Each page.  How many pages  are there?  Like 20.  Why are they that?  Wow.  Look how many pages  that is.  They're lawyers.  What do you expect?  Lawyers.  They just remove  the fun out of everything.  That's the total.  X.  How many pages is that?  She signs a total.  Get on mic.  I'm not even kidding anymore. 
[02:06:00]  She signs a total  of four pages.  But how many pages  are in that pamphlet?  You have a total of  nine.  Nine pages.  It's a nine page.  You see,  you have two sets of forms.  You have XM  and you also have DFL.  So there's two companies  that we have to protect.  The Danish Football League?  Why?  There's two elements here.  The dumb fucking  liberal organization.  Thank you.  Bo, stop talking.  Anyway,  here's what's going on.  There are two sets of companies. 
[02:06:30]  One is for the visual element.  The other one is for  the audio element.  Oh.  And people have to sign up  on everything.  The twins shall meet.  Exactly.  What is DFL?  Is that one of your companies?  Exactly.  Oh.  He has like side companies now.  Steve's slipping it in.  It's not slipping it in.  It's been going on  for the last six years.  Yeah, but.  Thank you.  Anyway,  we have to make sure  that everybody's protected  just in case.  Yeah.  In case your hat falls on them  and they get third degree burns.  In case my hat falls on them  and they burn.  But we're good.  We've got five guys up here now.  Do we have fire extinguishers  just in case your hat falls off 
[02:07:00]  and sets the place on fire?  Yes.  All right.  All right.  Can we talk to the girl now?  We got the hot chicken here.  We're doing paperwork.  Now that it's 8 o'clock.  It stinks.  Two hours ago  we were supposed to start this.  There you go.  Okay.  And why is King Kong Bundy here?  Where did he arrive?  I thought he was dead.  Good call.  Grossberger,  you're hurting me.  Oh my God.  What a mess.  Sorry, Candy,  that you had to deal  with the red gate.  So we were chatting.  You're in town to show your snatch. 
[02:07:30]  You're in town to shoot?  I'm in town  in the process  of trying to get things together  for a movie  I am trying to get together.  Candy and the Land of the Midgets.  Yes.  You're the one  that likes the midgets then.  I am the one.  Can you do something  with a midget on our show?  If you can find me one,  bring him on down.  We'll find one.  Give me 10 minutes.  Any midgets out there  that want to be with a porn star,  watch this.  And she's hot.  Bring him on down.  And if you happen to be  near 111 West 57th Street, 
[02:08:00]  you can come down now.  I own so much midget porn.  Would you say  perform oral treats  on a midget?  Would you do that?  Yeah, bring him on down.  What is it about midgets  that turns you on?  Just the novelty.  The novelty.  She has a Snow White fetish.  Is it like you're picturing  him just on top of you?  No, I want to be on my knees  and him standing behind me  and we're still  at equal levels.  Oh, at the equal height.  That is hot.  And he's taking you  from behind.  Yes.  That's great.  And that gets you all excited.  Oh, yeah.  Little midget hands  wrapping around your boobies. 
[02:08:30]  Where's Rich Voss  when we need him?  I've never personally  been introduced to a midget.  Really?  No.  But you watch midget porn  all the time.  Yes.  Would you mind  if he had like  a little elf hat on  and midget clothing?  No, that'd be super hot.  Wow.  You are weird.  I love it.  We got to have that  in the studio.  Yes, we do.  Any midgets,  you got to show up  but you have to wear  an elf hat.  Yes, please.  Come on now.  Now, where are you from?  Originally,  or where do I live right now?  Do you live in the area? 
[02:09:00]  I live in Ohio.  So you could come down  and a day or two notice  if we find midgets, right?  Okay, good.  Ohio is the midget state.  I'm down in a three-hour notice  if it's an hour and a half.  All right,  we will find a midget  and we'll do it next week  during the free play week.  Mike, if you have a call.  Oh, is he hot?  You know,  I don't go out with just anybody.  I like him real hot.  I'd like an attractive midget, please.  I like a nice ass.  I can kneel.  Well, she's got a kneel.  How about a dwarf?  What's the difference? 
[02:09:30]  Exactly.  Good point.  That's what I wanted to hear.  Well, I think, see, now...  Literally, you'll work for me.  All right, good.  People get it confused.  I think what you...  I think you like the dwarfs.  Midgets are like regular people,  only smaller.  Okay.  The dwarf is the one  that you always see  in like the Oompa Loompas  and is that the kind you like?  The little dwarfs?  Either way.  Either way.  Either way.  As long as you're little.  How about a legless guy?  Which type of Y-chromosome  deformity do you seek? 
[02:10:00]  We're going to cast your movie for you.  Oh, I'm hoping so.  We have all the confidence  in the world at our abilities.  We will find midgets  for your midget porno.  Just walk up to them in the street.  Do you want to fool around  with a hot chick?  I've never seen one in person.  You've never seen a midget in person?  It's a laugh riot.  You probably didn't.  You just thought it was a baby.  So...  Ah, go chase yourself.  So what do you want to get done  with this movie?  What kind of scenes  with the midgets?  Actually, what we're going to do  is like a Snow White 
[02:10:30]  kind of medieval...  I told you.  Yeah, exactly.  You need seven?  Candy.  Well, I want as many as possible.  Does that like turn you on so much  thinking of seven dwarfs  just like all over you  touching you everywhere?  Midget gang bang.  Midget gang bang.  There's a guy that says  he'll cut his legs off  to be in the porno.  And then he'll wear  wacky shoes on his stumps for you.  Hey, would you...  If we could get two midgets,  would you let one stand behind you  and then would you perform  a Hummer on one  at the same time?  Of course.  How hot would that be? 
[02:11:00]  Well, it would be fun to watch.  It would be hot to watch too, Jimmy?  Or you could get like  three, four, five.  Let's see.  Okay, yeah.  Five would work.  I could do five at once.  Five at once.  My nephew's ten.  How about if I gave him a cigar?  I've got two hands.  I've got two hands.  I've got two hands.  All right, I got the five figured out.  Yeah, of course.  I was trying to figure it out  until you said I got two hands.  Okay.  I got it.  I got it now.  There's a poor guy  that got a boat to his head  that can't get laid  and here we are  trying to hook up a midget.  Five midgets.  Five midgets.  That's actually one real person.  Yeah. 
[02:11:30]  Oh.  Wow.  So how many features  have you made?  Actually, I've only been  in the industry  for about two.  Yeah, she's young.  Three or four months now.  Three or four months?  You're 20, right?  Yes, 20.  You're 20.  When did you turn 20?  August.  You were 19  just a few months ago.  Yes, I was.  And were you in high school  a couple of years ago?  Yes, as a matter of fact.  Opie, just a couple  of short years ago.  Graduated in 02. 
[02:12:00]  You did?  Yes.  Class of 02.  We were on the air  before we got fired.  She was roaming  the hallways of a high school.  Putting hearts,  I heart genetic malformations  on her.  Candy's really hot, too.  That's great.  Yeah, we know  the other girls here.  Trust us.  We know.  We want to talk to Candy.  And how did you get  into the adult film industry?  Through a friend of mine,  Destiny St. Clair. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah?  She's also based  out of Cleveland.  She's been trying  to get me to do it  for years now.  Finally, like three days  before she was leaving,  she's like,  you're going with me?  I'm like, yeah, sure.  Is Cleveland becoming  the porno capital  of the world?  No, there is no porn  in Cleveland.  I go to L.A.  once a month.  Did you have a lot  of sex in school  and stuff growing up?  I have always been  quite of a nympho.  A lot of sex.  Yes.  And then, so porn  was just kind of  a natural progression.  Pretty much.  What was the first one like?  Were you nervous? 
[02:13:00]  Not really.  No?  No, I'm a huge exhibitionist,  so it didn't really...  Do you have on underpants?  No.  Yeah, now that we know you,  I guess she could get naked,  right?  Uh-huh.  Wait, do we have to cover  the...  Oh, God.  Christ on us,  pony.  Crap again.  What are we covering?  We've got to cover  the goddamn windows.  Why?  Because there's some people  in here that don't like  nude women.  What?  We can't take a chance...  Kick them out.  The weird part is  it's all guys here.  You're the only female,  except for the female listener  and she doesn't mind, but... 
[02:13:30]  Well, who should we worry about?  Why are we covering the windows?  Time to get the New York Times out.  Oh, Steve wants to go  cover the windows  and the newspapers  burst into flames  when he does stuff.  I feel bad for the listeners  that can't see  what we're doing, though.  Don't worry.  It doesn't look like  they're seeing much anyway.  Yeah, they're passing out.  They're crashing.  They've been here  since one in the morning.  Yeah, the guys that brought  the ribs,  they're now crashing hard.  Real hard.  God.  Why didn't they...  Oh, God.  What?  Why didn't they do this earlier?  When everyone was running around  saying,  what should we do?  Just when I thought  Ben was useless. 
[02:14:00]  I know.  I'm just kidding.  Ben rocks.  No, I mean,  nothing's getting done here.  You're not wearing  any underpants at all.  No.  That's very sexy.  Would you like to see?  A quick flash would be nice.  You just can't take it off yet  because there's...  Well, she's...  Pierce twice.  It's just like every girl  in Cleveland.  She's so hot.  I love Cleveland chicks.  They're the hottest chicks.  Yeah, I love chicks  from Cleveland.  What actress do people  tell you you look like?  Kate Hudson  and Heather Graham.  Really?  Yeah.  Those would be the two  I get most frequently.  No one ever says  Cameron Diaz?  No.  I see the Kate Hudson.  I see that a little bit. 
[02:14:30]  I see a little Kate Hudson.  Yeah?  Yeah.  There you go.  Lovely.  And she's pierced down below, huh?  Twice.  Twice?  I only saw one.  They're both...  Nine piercings.  Here, come here, babe.  Nine piercings.  There's a hoop and a barbell.  Wow.  Yeah.  Holy Toledo.  You like that, Jimmy?  Fantastic, yeah.  He had his hands in his pocket  when he was looking.  Yeah, she's loving him.  Grabbing.  Grabbing his plumpness.  Remember?  Keith, what's going on?  Someone has to tell us  what's going on  because my guys  have just failed us today.  We are going downstairs  with all the paperwork 
[02:15:00]  and everyone's going to  fill out their paperwork  and we're going to start  hustling people up.  They're going to start  filling out the nine-page form now?  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  We're expediting the process  as we speak.  Why haven't these people  been filling out forms  since we got here this morning?  Don't we have five people  up here already, though?  Yes, five people are up here.  They are ready to go  and the rest of the people,  they took their identification,  checked their ID  and processed all the paperwork 
[02:15:30]  to be filled out.  You know, this is just  a stupid radio show, right?  You know, this isn't the precinct.  We don't take all day  to do things.  Like I said,  the good old days  where we took the X  on the piece of paper  and filed them in  worked for me,  but I don't remember that.  It was one sheet of paper  with, like, a paragraph on it  and they just had to sign it.  How did they not have  been handed stuff  to sign already?  It is quarter after eight.  How do they not have  shit to sign?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Because Ben is, you know,  crapping and puking  still somewhere. 
[02:16:00]  Ben would have got this done.  Where's Eric?  When we first came in.  Where's Sex Bagel?  He thought it was important  to get me more Pop-Tarts,  but now I haven't seen them.  That was probably  the least important thing  to do today.  No offense, Opie.  I agree.  I'm sure you will agree, yes,  that getting your Pop-Tarts,  that was, well,  all I asked to get them  cooked up for a minute.  What happened to your Pop-Tarts,  by the way?  They overcooked  because of the parts.  I come in here  and they're black.  Yeah.  Our producers,  I've never seen  Burp Pop-Tarts.  They were cooked  perfectly,  and then Steve put  his hat down on them 
[02:16:30]  for a second.  It just,  yeah,  our producers  are kind of stupid.  Everyone knows  you just cook them  for a minute.  Those are Burps.  You just heat up Pop-Tarts.  You don't cook them.  They're all pre-cooked.  Yeah.  You just heat them up  real fast in a toaster.  That's it, a minute.  Even you could cook  a Pop-Tart, right?  A girl that's a blonde.  I'm a very good cook.  A blonde.  The paper is almost up  so we can get her naked.  Steve, where's Sex Bagel?  How has this paperwork  not been filled out?  Eric is downstairs 
[02:17:00]  corralling the next five guys  that are going to be coming up.  All right.  So we're bringing them up  in groups.  Five at a time.  The building is utterly paranoid  that we're going to  break something,  blow something up,  and...  Too bad for the fucking building.  Enough of the fucking building  already worrying.  We didn't do anything wrong.  They have every right  considering what happened  last time.  It happens.  You know,  the show that we can't  talk about anymore.  Right, I remember that one.  Okay, yes.  I was asking about  her first movie.  What was that like  and what was the scene?  You know, I'd like to know.  You walk in and... 
[02:17:30]  What is it, the set?  Actually, I worked  with an older man.  He was probably around 50,  as a matter of fact.  So your first porno movie  was with a 50-year-old guy.  And his wife taped it.  His wife taped it.  Yes.  I don't know if you ever  heard Brooke Hunter.  No.  No, no.  Maybe that was for  their private collection.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, I know.  It was a little shady.  Yeah, this will be in Hollywood.  My wife's going to film it  and I'm going to bang you.  He had a video camera.  I blow him in the car  and he's going to send me a check.  So you walk in and... 
[02:18:00]  What is it, just this house?  Yeah, actually it was...  No set?  Just this house?  He films a lot  of this house, actually.  Yeah?  Yes.  Very professional or was it  kind of...  Very professional.  Just, all right,  get on the bed and...  No.  Actually, it was on the pool table.  On the pool table?  And did it start out  with a little aural?  Oh, of course.  So you, you know...  What was the plot?  Your shooting pool?  No, actually,  because he's actually a lawyer  as a matter of fact.  That's great.  And so he was doing 
[02:18:30]  a movie set about  like people needing  law advice or whatnot.  Sure, sure.  So that's how it started off.  So you walk in,  you need a lawyer.  Exactly.  And you're like,  hi, I need a hollow.  The door's closed, by the way,  so you can get naked  any time now.  Oh, yeah.  One moment, please.  Sure.  She is fantastic.  She's so perky.  I'll say she is.  Wow.  Yeah, those are  20-year-old boobs.  Wow.  Very nice.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, wow.  Nice tattoo on the back.  Big, huge tattoo 
[02:19:00]  right above the target area, Anthony.  Terrific.  Must give some applause.  Very nice.  Candy's very, very nice.  You sure are lovely.  That's great.  She hasn't been ravaged  by time or anything.  No, you still got  everything happening there.  Very nice.  Very lovely.  Make it.  Yes, you are.  And now we all just stare  and...  All right, cool.  So they're filling out paperwork.  They should be in about 950.  Yes, Keith. 
[02:19:30]  Real quick,  just let me go down the list  of your name,  your model's name,  your stage name.  You're also known as  your mailing address,  your city-state zip,  your picture ID 1,  your phone number,  your mobile number,  your date of birth,  your age,  your legal name,  your social security number,  your alias, if any,  your professional name,  you're also known as  please sign,  today's date,  picture ID number 2,  your email,  your website,  your driver's license,  and the expiration  of any driver's license.  Page 1.  That's page 1.  Page 1.  And then page 2 
[02:20:00]  has the same questions again  after six long paragraphs  of blah,  blah,  blah.  Same thing on page 3.  All right,  this is going to end.  Same thing on page 4.  No,  we're going to have to revamp this.  Website?  Why website?  This is going to end.  Trust me,  this is going to end.  Ridiculous.  That's why it's taking so long.  I know.  Ridiculous.  Anyway.  There's a naked girl  in this video.  That is all that matters.  And by the way,  we haven't had one midget call yet  that wants to get banged in a plane. 
[02:20:30]  They're all little people.  They're probably all at pay phones  just waiting for a boost.  Listening,  crying,  a little tear from his eye.  I can't get up.  Hey,  could you help a little fella?  Could you help an old  alter boy father?  Yeah,  we'll find a midget.  We had a midget girl come in.  She wanted to be a stripper,  I think.  And she got naked for us  on the console.  This was at the old place.  And she started crying  and realized it was a bad idea  and she didn't want to  do it after all.  Yeah,  she didn't want to pursue that.  It was one of the most  uncomfortable moments ever. 
[02:21:00]  Weeping naked midget.  It's the first time  she ever saw the world  from the height  of a normal person.  Oh,  maybe that's a car.  And she realized  how ridiculous she looks  walking around  bumping into knees  and crotches.  By the way,  everyone's calling in  going,  after seeing Candy  all hot and nice here,  you'll definitely  get a hooker tonight.  No,  I won't.  Oh,  right.  Jimmy's going to get  all worked up.  Jimmy's swearing off hookers.  I've spent a lot of money  doing awful things.  I see.  Yeah,  but I won't tonight.  No,  maybe.  You don't think so?  No,  I don't think so. 
[02:21:30]  I don't think so.  It was a positive no  and it's like,  no,  maybe.  I don't think so.  Well,  it's kind of like  taking somebody to dinner  but you're just  cutting out the dinner time.  What time do you need me?  Right after the show.  Wow.  He ain't kidding either,  Candy.  And you think I am?  All right,  Jimmy,  we got a love connection.  Yeah,  I love her.  She'd probably be  out of my range anyway.  She's hot.  He's got a big hog though.  No,  I don't.  Most of his friends  have seen it.  I'll put it in my hand.  Candy.  Turn off the camera. 
[02:22:00]  No,  it's very average right now anyway.  You've got to give me  some time to get worked up.  I'm packing like two right now.  Well,  come here and put it in my mouth  and go take care of things.  Jesus.  Jesus.  My hog is very average.  You're a porn girl.  If the midget chick comes in,  I'll be happy to  whip it out  and show it to her  and measure it  against her face.  Her little puffy hand.  Yeah.  Look at this.  It hits your torso  from your mouth.  Well,  let her feel it  through the jeans.  It's soft.  We don't need to look.  I can change that.  Get her over there.  Just run it for a second.  It's soft.  Tim? 
[02:22:30]  Candy,  what do you think?  It's fine?  Yeah.  Wonderful.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow,  her face  just turned  a little pink there.  What do you think,  Candy?  Oh,  I'm absolutely thrilled.  She's lovely.  Goddamn Jimmy's  going to get laid again.  She's moaning a little.  That's good,  right?  Oh,  yeah.  Slightly wet at the moment.  She has lovely.  She's just staring at me.  this is great.  You are a nymph.  She doesn't even know 
[02:23:00]  where she is anymore.  She grabbed his pants  and now it's like,  oh,  that's perfect.  Now,  Jim's just gazing down  at her womanhood.  Nakedness.  Nice.  And,  uh,  he's grabbing himself again.  And then he's got  that whacked out look  that he gets.  It's just nice.  You get a whacked out look,  though.  That's the pervity  that pops out.  It's really sexy.  It's really beautiful.  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  All right.  Moving on. 
[02:23:30]  I must say,  uh,  yeah,  there's something going on  between these two.  Yeah.  I'm just looking.  She doesn't mind me looking.  No,  not at all.  I won't touch.  I'm just,  yeah.  What do you think,  Candy?  Um,  about.  Jimmy?  I'm a nice fella,  right?  I'm in love.  Stop rubbing yourself.  She's really sexy.  She's really sexy.  All right,  why don't you see  what's going on there now?  It's a little bit,  it's better,  yeah.  Yeah,  we're getting there.  It was making that  whole face.  Oh. 
[02:24:00]  Wow.  Yeah,  he's definitely,  uh,  he's definitely  doing something today.  You've turned on  a porn star.  Look at her.  She's definitely,  no,  right?  Oh,  I am.  I can tell.  She's not faking this.  I just want to kiss it.  It's just nice,  man.  Turn off the camera,  Steve.  Oh.  Real fast,  go ahead.  Nah,  I don't know if she's in here  for something else.  I don't know.  Something else.  She's not here for that.  You're not little enough.  Oh,  I like that.  Never heard that.  Believe me,  that really is a first. 
[02:24:30]  I usually have to have  eight-year-olds come over  to tell me that.  All right,  are we finally ready  to give away the MiFi?  These guys have been  waiting outside for,  I don't know,  six,  seven hours now.  You dopey midgets  don't know what you're missing.  No.  You stupid midgets out there.  She is really sexy.  Jim,  take your hands off  the porn star.  I'm just talking about  some very nice about it.  That wasn't rude.  All right,  we got the cherry.  Steve,  are we ready?  You've got to step up  now here.  You've got to take  complete control.  We have five gentlemen 
[02:25:00]  outside ready to go now.  Okay,  good.  Another five on deck.  We got the microphone.  We have a microphone  over there.  It's already plugged in.  All right.  I thought the mic  was in Jim's pants.  Sorry.  Didn't mean to point.  We just have to get  the Cool Whip out of the fridge  and then we're ready to go.  Okay.  Nice,  fresh.  And all the food  that you told the listeners  to come down with  is...  Now it's all over the console.  It's making its way  into the studio.  A lot of donuts.  People opted for the donuts.  I'm seeing some pastry  and cookie boxes.  There's some Pop-Tarts.  Pop-Tarts s'mores  variety.  Entenmann's. 
[02:25:30]  We got beef jerky.  Beef jerky,  nice.  Steakhouse seasoning,  good.  A lot of donuts.  Is there a producer  in there anywhere?  A producer?  I don't know,  because Steve said  to bring food yesterday  for some reason  that sane people  cannot possibly understand.  I want super genius  added to my business card  because if I didn't say that,  there'd be 150 people  out there  instead of the 100  that showed up.  Yeah, well,  I get that.  That makes you super genius,  I guess.  Thank you. 
[02:26:00]  Steve C.,  super genius.  All right,  why don't we get Candy  in position here?  Keith,  where would you like me?  Why don't you assist?  Well,  that's our lesbian couch  that we covered up  with the card.  How hot is she?  And Keith,  why don't you move  the microphone over there?  Candy's fantastic.  So she could still  be on mic.  You have a smoke.  Wow.  What a hiney you have.  I'll say,  what a smoking body.  Wow.  I haven't gotten  that view yet.  I have the worst seat  in the house these days.  I have a great seat.  I used to have  the best seat  at the old studio.  This one,  I can only see 
[02:26:30]  shit from like  the waist up.  I want to bring  my friend she wants  to see.  What?  Wait,  are we going  balloon knot?  Jimmy wants to,  what?  We doing balloon knot  or well's eye?  Balloon knot.  The girl outside  wants to come in  and watch.  You got to let her  watch.  Oh,  definitely bring her in.  Yeah,  bring her in  if she wants to come in.  Jimmy is constantly  working.  He's the hardest  working man  in show business.  She wants to watch.  She's here to watch.  She's here to help.  Oh,  she's going to throw  too,  right?  I am.  You're one of the  contestants?  Yes,  I am.  What's your name again? 
[02:27:00]  Linda.  Hi,  Linda.  What do you think  of Candy?  She's very cute.  I like the piercings.  A lot of nice piercings.  Okay.  All right.  We're finally ready  to do cherry darts.  Finally.  Oh,  Steve's opening up.  Wow,  that would have looked  real bad if you  couldn't open that  cherry jar.  He was straining.  Big Lebanese fingers  turning red.  Hey,  does 5'2 count  as a midget,  by the way?  Someone's asking.  No.  No.  It's got to be  a real midget.  They have to be  the type of midget  that people fight  the urge to beat  on sight. 
[02:27:30]  But everyone knows  what you're talking about.  They really do.  The type you just  want to smack in the face.  All right.  Why isn't there  a hanger in your skull?  Linda's going to be  the first one  to throw the cherry dart.  All right,  here's how it's going  to work.  We've got 25 contestants,  right?  Okay.  We're going to have  a winner from each heat,  and then we'll have  the finals.  Okay.  So the closest  to Candy's balloon knot.  Right. 
[02:28:00]  Okay.  If we could ask  for visual,  what we're going  to need is  for Candy to be  all the way over  toward the wall.  Yeah,  or else I'm not  going to be able  to give commentary.  Yeah,  but then we won't  be able to...  That's good.  Wow.  My God.  Now that's a view.  Yeah,  I'll say.  Are we doing  the whale's eye  or the balloon knot?  I think we should  do balloon knot.  Yeah.  But it's going to be  hard for her to position  with the balloon  on on the couch.  Backdoor action.  Yeah,  try that.  Yeah,  go like...  Oh,  yeah.  Oh, 
[02:28:30]  my goodness.  Keith,  what do you think?  How are you going  to get the thing  to stick in there?  I think we might  have to arch  the back a little  more to bring...  Yeah.  There we go.  Wow,  yeah.  That's a great target.  Perfect.  Keith,  yes,  you're happy  with the positioning  of Candy?  A little more...  Like that?  Oh,  perfect.  Hey,  can we...  We need to  Mike Herr as well.  So,  yes,  Sex Bagel,  you're going to have  to run around  a little bit.  Move that mic  out of the way,  though.  There's no reason  for there to be  a boom mic  in the way  of her anus. 
[02:29:00]  All right,  my brother's  videotaping.  Look at him  stepping in.  There we go.  All right,  Candy,  how do you feel  in that position?  Absolutely wonderful.  You feel good  as the target?  Yes.  She is so sexy.  She sure is lovely.  You're so ridiculous.  20-year-old porn star  that wants to have  a midget porno maid.  Wasn't Al Leiter  supposed to be here  to discuss how  you should hold  the cherry  and throw it?  All right.  Here's the fastball grip.  And Tim McCarver  can come and give  worthless information?  That fucking dullard. 
[02:29:30]  Linda,  is there anything else  you want to say  before you throw  your dart?  Say hi to the guys  at opianthony.net.  Say hi to the guys  at opianthony.net.  No, opianthony.net.  That's correct.  I always get that wrong.  opianthony.net.  Now, where are they  trying to get these  cherries?  Those are nice fishnets,  by the way.  Well, they're going to  try to get it right  in that balloon knot there.  Okay.  So that's why you've  got to arch as much  as you can.  There you go.  Yeah.  All right, here we go.  Now, this is a difficult  throw because of the  whipped cream, Opie.  It makes it unbalanced.  It also sticks to your fingers  and might go off one way,  the other up, down.  You're not sure where 
[02:30:00]  Underhand is probably  the best way,  although I'm just...  Well, we've got a southpaw.  Now, we've got to make sure  she's behind a certain line  so this is fair for everybody.  We need a definite measure.  Why are you taking a picture  of the target on your cell phone  to show the guys  at the preseason?  Masturbational purposes later.  Oh, yeah.  Good idea, bro.  All right.  I guess that's good.  See the thing that keeps  the door from slamming  into the wall,  that line on the wall?  Yeah.  All right.  That's the official line?  Good.  All right.  That'll be the official line.  Wait, what about the other girl?  We're doing one girl  at a time, right?  Or two?  We have another porn star here. 
[02:30:30]  You know, we can invite...  Why don't we get all five  of the first heat in here  so they know what they're...  We've got to bring  the other girl in.  There's no reason  for her to have to wait  unless she's filling out  her fucking book of paperwork.  Well, it's the first five, right?  Yeah.  Let's get all five  for the first heat.  I think what he's saying  is the other...  The other girl  that's getting cherries  thrown at her.  Oh, the other girl?  Yeah.  Oh, I forgot there was  another porn star here.  Yes, yes.  Get her up here.  Should we have two targets  and then you can decide  which target to go for?  One target might be bigger  than the other target.  I don't know.  I'm thinking 
[02:31:00]  that the other porn star  has a bigger target.  Do you think?  I doubt that.  Is it actually...  My ass is huge, dear.  What?  You're insane.  No, it's not huge.  That's a perfect ass.  Are you insane?  Huge to a midget, maybe.  All right, now we're...  Wow.  The other porn star  has made her way  into the...  Star, right?  Yes.  Hey, Star, how are you?  I'm good.  How are you?  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Did you meet Candy?  Great to be here.  I have out in the waiting room.  Holy Toledo.  You're beautiful, too. 
[02:31:30]  Thank you.  She can grab that mic right there.  Awesome.  Why isn't she naked?  Yeah, why aren't she naked?  I like when the girl says...  Can't we have a conversation first?  How are you doing?  I'm good.  How are you?  I like you're naked.  Hey, be nice.  We're kidding, we're kidding.  So that's Star, Anthony.  We're not.  Very lovely.  Thank you.  Yes, hi.  Hi.  How are you?  I'm great.  That's a very lovely top you have on.  I like the little stars on your breasts.  Hence the name.  Hence the name Star, right? 
[02:32:00]  Yes.  Are you doing a film in town?  Are you in town shooting?  Yeah, we actually have a photo shoot tonight and a quick one last night.  And, of course, we're here for Black Mirror.com.  Oh, yeah, Black Mirror Productions.  That's Joe Galant's company.  Yeah.  Good doing a movie.  Joe rocks.  Yeah, he's fantastic.  All right.  Was that enough conversation or were you wanting a little more?  Geez, you're antsy, aren't you?  Well, you're lovely.  If you were, like, fat, we'd talk to you for three hours.  You're hot.  I was talking to you for about an hour.  What are we implying here? 
[02:32:30]  No, no, no.  That was just a paperwork thing.  But now all the paperwork is done.  Believe me, if it wasn't for paperwork, we would put it with script.  So you were naked through the conversation.  Yeah.  You were naked through most of it.  Yeah.  All right.  Line them up.  That's my cue.  Oh, yeah.  The skirt's coming off.  That was her cue.  She's getting naked now.  You know, we would love to sit and converse more, but we're running out of time.  We're running out of show.  We're running out of show.  Wow.  Holy.  Holy Toledo.  Another hot blonde in the studio.  Very nice.  Joe, applause. 
[02:33:00]  Are we going to get pictures of this on some websites?  Hopefully.  I wouldn't worry about it.  McQueenAnthony.com, FoundYourMusic.com.  Steve and his flaming hat entering the studio.  Steve, everything's under control?  Oh, yeah.  And these are the first five animals that will be throwing their darts?  Yes, and there's more coming.  Will your corporation, DFL, be taking care of this?  Yes, they've all taken care of it.  Don't be flaming leisure wear.  Sometimes I wish Master Poe would keep his goddamn mouth shut.  That's funny. 
[02:33:30]  All right, Star is down to a G-string.  She is a looker.  The top.  The top that's very tight.  Oh, she took off the Stars off the bra.  The bra's still on, Anthony.  A nice black bra.  Net top is coming off.  Very good.  What do you guys think so far?  Nice.  Thumbs up from the cherry dart throwers that are very drunk and hungover at the same time now.  Yeah, they're crashing on the chairs outside. 
[02:34:00]  We were looking.  If anybody wants a donut, take a donut, boys, if you want a donut.  They have other things to worry about.  Yeah, exactly.  Donuts look like they were plucked from Ben's toilet.  What the hell is that?  Yeah, it's got orange on it, like the blood in his 50th stool.  Way to keep the mood going.  There's still no sign of Ben, by the way.  No, he was supposed to show up an hour after we started the show.  Yeah.  Which was a couple of hours ago.  He was probably doing a headstand and shitting in a shower. 
[02:34:30]  Midget-bodied fuck.  Why are you mad at Ben?  I love Ben, but he should be here.  Who doesn't?  He should be seeing this.  The top is coming off, ladies and gentlemen.  Oh, yeah.  Star.  Oh, very nice.  Natural, right?  Very natural.  Very big.  All right.  And there goes the G-string.  There's something you don't see every day.  That is well-groomed.  A little V.  Very nice.  Nice V.  A little V.  Got the, yeah, the basic shape all nice and tamed.  Wow.  Wow.  A big tattoo on the back. 
[02:35:00]  Nice hiney.  Yes.  Everything is looking very good.  If I may compliment your thumper.  Lovely.  So, do you want to get in the position next to Candy now?  Okay.  We're going to have two targets.  Now, Opie, the contestants will have to verbally tell us what target they're going for because  they could be going for the left target, like throw it wrong and it hits the right target.  I'm thinking, look at the draw, though.  Are you kidding?  You're saying pool tournament rules.  You have to call the pocket.  Yeah, you've got to call the pocket.  You can't just throw it willy-nilly and if it hits one, you win. 
[02:35:30]  It goes in and goes in.  Wait, Keith, is there a way to move the couch?  Can you move the couch a little bit closer?  This way they can put their heads more forward and arch better?  I don't know.  That might take up a little more of the shooting room.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think the girls are in.  You want to make it a challenge.  I think the girls are in a nice position now.  Okay.  All right.  And now we need an official marker or measurer.  Who's going to be the official judge?  Oh, he's outside, though.  He's outside.  Kenny's outside?  He should be in now.  He should be inside now, Grim.  Yeah, Club Soda Kenny is definitely the official judge of cherry darts. 
[02:36:00]  Do we have some type of measuring device?  We wish we could get the Frank's Place guy to do it.  He'd be great.  Oh, yeah.  He would be great.  Should we get him?  Someone get Kenny.  Get Kenny.  We need him immediately.  Candy would dig him.  Huh?  Well, then.  I want to invite him in.  A little friend out there.  Oh, Oompa?  More little friends?  Little friends?  Where?  No, calm down.  We haven't found midgets for you.  I haven't found a midget yet.  Where are you?  We will find midgets for you.  You stupid midgets.  The word has been...  You don't even know.  Yeah. 
[02:36:30]  Where is he?  Downstairs?  Yeah, I'm getting up.  Oh, my God.  Now we've got to wait for Kenny, the official judge, to make his way up to the studio.  Okay.  I'll be right up.  No.  Star, is there anything else you want to promote?  The show, just because Ben's not here.  Yeah.  We're about to launch a website, exclusive website, zanastar.com.  Zanastar.com?  Z-A-N-A-S-T-A-R?  X-A-N-A-S-T-A-R.  Oh, you have to spell that. 
[02:37:00]  X-Z-N-A?  No.  No, X-A-N-A.  All right.  X-A-N-A.  Okay.  Zanastar.com.  Should launch before the end of the year.  Okay, cool.  And, of course, we're here to promote that I'm a Black Mirror girl, so blackmirror.com.  Blackmirror.com.  That's right.  Fantastic.  All right.  Why don't we get to know our contestants, Anthony?  Mike Tyson spelling.  Well, Zayna, how am I supposed to know?  You think half of these drunken fucks are going to know how to spell Zayna?  Z-E-R-I-W.  I'd kiss you, but you're so damned ugly. 
[02:37:30]  All right.  We met our first contestant, Linda.  She's got a cherry dart in hand.  She's ready to go.  She's also lovely.  She's beautiful.  Very tall, too.  Yeah, she's a drink of water.  About 5'10", 5'11".  Mm-hmm.  That's right.  Wow.  And she's promoting.  She's here for opianthony.net, right?  Correct.  Okay.  Who else do we have?  Artie from Yonkers.  I'm six foot.  I get this height like anyone cares.  That's funny.  That's very funny.  Anything you want to say or promote?  Tyrone House down by Yonkers train station. 
[02:38:00]  Nice bar.  Nice bar.  Okay.  Does everyone there have a John Turturro haircut?  No.  And you've been outside since what time?  I got there like 4.45.  Oh, how did he move up in the line?  There were guys out there like two.  And herky jerky for Ben.  Oh, okay.  Oh, is that what you brought?  Yeah.  Oh, it says, look.  You put herky over beef.  And it says, oh boy, Ben on top.  Yeah, it does say, oh boy, Ben.  Oh boy, Ben.  Natural style, herky jerky.  Very good.  That's hilarious.  I give you a wacky horn.  Thank you. 
[02:38:30]  That is some zany jerky.  Ben will just look at it.  And zany.  X-A-N-Y.  All right, who's the guy in the Eagles jersey?  I'm Gootman from opanthony.net.  Who are you, sweetie?  Gootman.  Oh, cool.  And Eagles playing the Packers.  Yeah.  You going to the game?  You got an extra ticket?  Actually, I'm going to find out today if I'm going, yeah.  Nice.  You don't have tickets?  No, I don't have tickets.  I did the fireworks a couple weeks ago.  Yeah, cool.  That's sweet.  And that's about all you want to say?  What time did you show up today?  5.30.  I took the train from Philly at like 5.30? 
[02:39:00]  What happened to the guys over here?  I came with Linda.  That's why I got up here.  All right.  Ah.  And you guys came from Philly for this?  Well, I did, yeah.  I left my house like 3 in the morning.  Very cool.  And these are the guys that brought the ribs about 2 and a half hours ago.  Yes, the ribs.  Guys, it's a little later.  How are you feeling now?  We're representing all them scotch and whiskey drinkers out there.  Yeah, these are the guys that provided the whiskey this morning at 2, 3 in the morning,  whatever time it was.  We're just smoking ribs out there, fellas.  Yes.  Yeah.  Did you guys beast up the ribs or what? 
[02:39:30]  We ate the ribs.  Yeah, what did you think, man?  That was great.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Special sauce.  I hear there's a lot of empties outside on the sidewalk.  Secret sauce.  Yeah, yeah.  Secret sauce.  You'll find out later.  Secret sauce, my friend.  I don't like the way he's saying that.  Secret sauce.  We're tripping out, you know, 12 hours from now.  I don't know why that's happening.  Seeing little purple dots.  Where's Kenny?  Nothing to do with that.  Kenny!  We need you now. 
[02:40:00]  I'm filling out my paperwork.  By the way, if you're frustrated out there in Radio Land, this was instead of, you know,  a commercial break.  So let's...  What happened?  You're the official judge.  You're the official measurer.  What are you doing?  Who told me?  All right, we got to get you some...  All right, well, Kenny's here, so let's get the girls in position.  All right, let's get the girls back in the position.  We met our contestants, our first five.  Linda and her fishnets.  Are we ready?  Fucking couch covered in plastic like it's grandma's.  The girls are naked.  Yeah, we got both girls in position.  You know what's going on here? 
[02:40:30]  You got to decide out of these five freaks who's closest to the balloon knot, okay?  But wait a minute.  So you get down there.  Yep.  You just have to watch.  You get close.  I'm a married man.  You might get hit.  You just look at it.  You just watch it.  You're a judge.  You're not putting...  No, you're the pervert.  I know.  That's why I can't judge.  Plus, I'm going to be throwing later.  You're the window...  Really?  Yeah.  Did you give him a sniff test yet?  Yeah, both of them.  This is just a window...  You're just window shopping.  Yeah.  All right?  It's okay to look.  You're not buying.  They got piercings?  They got everything going on down there.  Just don't go home with corn on your mustache. 
[02:41:00]  Holy mackerel.  Kenny, Kenny, the marking must be, or the actual, the measurement must be taken  from initial point of contact.  If the cherry hits and then rolls down and rolls over the primary target, that doesn't  count.  Do we have now a measure?  What are you going to measure with?  How am I going to pay attention looking at those team of buttockses?  I know.  Isn't that great?  Is this lipstick?  Yeah.  All right.  Use the lipstick. 
[02:41:30]  Well, you don't...  No, it'll...  It'll kind of mark itself.  All right, Kenny, you just got to pay attention.  But we need something to measure with.  That's what I'm saying.  How do we not have a ruler?  Do we have to...  No, no, no, no, no.  We don't...  People holding up their fingers.  Club server Kenny will make a judgment call.  Okay, fine.  And we'll decide who's closest.  Simple as that.  All right.  I will bet a few of these guys won't even hit the target.  I bet, too.  Because they're not as easy as you think to throw.  Are they just going to throw one each, I guess?  One.  That is all you get.  There is no do-overs, people.  You screw it up.  All right.  That's it.  Tough luck, right, Ant? 
[02:42:00]  Tough.  All right, move this microphone.  Did you see how big the targets are?  Tough kitty, said the kitty.  I know.  All right.  All right, here we go.  All right, ladies, are you ready?  No.  We are ready.  We cannot spread each other.  Huh?  All right.  Oh, we got a tape measure.  We got a tape measure just in case, Kenny.  Just in case it gets close.  Give it to Kenny.  All right, hold on.  Remember, the center of the point of contact is where the measurement will be taken.  All right, Linda, whenever you're ready.  Southpaw, 5'11", blonde, beautiful.  Our first throw.  Oh, my God! 
[02:42:30]  Are you kidding me?  What a perfect throw.  She got a bullseye.  Oh, my God.  She did.  Oh, my God.  A bullseye.  Is it all that?  Is it all that?  It's a complete bullseye.  Oh, hole in one.  Wait, let's get the official judge on the scene.  Kenny's.  Oh, my God.  Kenny's in there with the tape measure.  Oh, my God.  Kenny's measuring it.  Kenny, how far is it from her liver?  It's in the hole.  It's in the hole. 
[02:43:00]  It's a direct hit.  Are you kidding me?  Oh, my God.  First shot out of the box.  She got it.  Out of the box.  She got it in the box.  Everybody now, every contestant now, is just going to try to match that so that they can  be in a playoff.  Right, right.  Because that is a perfect shot.  Jesus, Linda.  Let's talk to Kenny.  Kenny, how did that feel?  Wonderful.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  It definitely hit the bullseye?  Come on.  More cherries than my ass.  Cinderella story.  Here at Augusta.  Hey, Linda.  Bravo.  Have you been practicing or something?  Yeah, did you practice? 
[02:43:30]  Get on mic over there.  I played a lot of beer pong in college.  It came in handy today.  Up for grabs, by the way.  The MiFi.  The portable XM radio.  And I hope she enjoys it.  I'm sure they're proud in Washington today.  All right.  Let's get the next contestant here.  We got to get this strapping young buck.  What's the guy's name again?  What's your name again?  Artie.  Artie.  Any final words?  Artie Murphy.  No, man.  That girl hit a bullseye.  Yeah, that is a tough act to follow.  Artie's got his cherry.  He's dipped it in the whipped cream. 
[02:44:00]  And Artie's going to attempt to...  You could go for either girl, by the way.  Yeah.  If you think there's a bigger target, you know, go for it.  I don't know.  That's right.  Wow.  Wow.  That was also...  It didn't stick.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  It's just a point of contact.  That was a bullseye.  All right.  Artie, calm down.  We got to...  Are you kidding?  Do we have two bullseyes in a row?  No, I can't give him a bullseye.  Why?  He's close, but no cigar.  The cheeks were closed.  He's in second place currently.  Wait.  The cheeks were closed. 
[02:44:30]  He had the opportunity.  He had the opportunity to shoot at either girl.  He chose the other girl.  And if her cheeks are a little closer together and it didn't go in as far as you would like,  you've got to take it from a point of contact.  It looks a little on the right cheek, right?  No, look at the left cheek.  No, it's actually more to the left.  You can't see from your ankle.  Let me clean the hole on the other one.  Let me clean that hole.  We're getting locked here.  The judge's word is final.  Give me the money.  I've got to take my headphones off.  I've got to walk.  I've got to give it to him.  Oh, my God.  You know what, Anthony?  I've got to walk.  I'm on the scene here.  Yes. 
[02:45:00]  Wow.  Look at that.  That would have...  I think that would have been a bullseye.  That is a bullseye.  That is a bullseye.  It's a bullseye.  You've got to give it to him.  It's a bullseye.  I think that's a bullseye.  You know what, or we'll give him a bullseye.  I think she might have...  Yep.  I think she might have clenched...  There's going to be a playoff.  I think she might have clenched her butt cheeks.  She might have clenched up a little...  She might have clenched just as he released the cherry dart.  It's like a piece of dust goes in your eye.  All right.  Give me a bullseye.  Artie's back in the competition with Linda.  Yeah, you have to.  It's only fair.  Eric, where are you?  Why don't you talk to Star?  Mike Star as I move back over here. 
[02:45:30]  Don't thank me.  I called it like I saw it.  We had to overrule you, Kenny, from the booth.  The video replay clearly showed that that was a bullseye.  She clenched her cheeks in mid-throw there.  Star, what do you think?  Was that a bullseye?  It felt pretty close, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll give it to Artie.  Wow.  I am amazed, Opie.  We have had back-to-back bullseyes on two different girls.  Just an amazing start to this competition.  Let's see if we can continue.  What's your name over there?  Dude, man. 
[02:46:00]  What?  Scott.  Thank you.  He's the guy in the Eagles jersey.  I have fucking nicknames all the time.  I'm amazed that Norton ate six donuts so far.  I haven't had any yet.  Oh, Jimmy.  I haven't had any yet.  My first one.  Your first one after a goddamn pork rib.  So what?  Ribs and donuts.  You're eating too much this morning.  I'm just concerned about it.  You know who suffers?  We do.  Around 9.30 we're going to suffer.  Ribs and donuts?  And you like to fart?  Yeah, there's going to be problems.  All right, the Eagles guy who came up from Philly just to throw a cherry dart.  Good luck, son. 
[02:46:30]  All right, I want you to make it.  Oh, hey, excuse me, sir.  Do you shoot darts?  I shoot a little bit.  Yeah, I see his stance and his hold is a little professional there.  I like that.  All right, he's got a lot of confidence here.  Let's go.  Don't choke.  Oh!  Oh!  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Hit the thigh.  Thanks for coming.  Thank you.  Loser.  Now, you shot darts, though?  Yeah, I play darts.  You play darts on a league?  Yes, bro.  He's on a dart league.  That's why he hit the bullseye, right? 
[02:47:00]  I practiced last night, boy.  I played cherries.  You were practicing?  Oh, yeah.  Wow, look at that.  Good boy.  All right.  Very good.  One of the rib guys, forget this.  These guys are too hammered to throw darts.  I know.  Hurry up.  Don't talk about it to us.  You want to throw a rib?  Now, any final words there, bro, before you throw your darts?  Anything?  You got anything to say?  Dude, this is going in the hole, my friend.  All right.  Ah, he's talking smack.  I like it.  Here, Mike the girls there, Sex Bagel.  Very confident.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:47:30]  And here we go.  Here we go.  Gentle, dear.  He's getting whipped cream on his fingers.  Hey, he's winding up.  Relax, dude.  He's hanging in there, boy.  Oh!  Missed.  Missed completely.  He missed.  Kenny?  He hit the couch.  It was a bad miss, huh?  Hit the couch.  He hit the couch between the legs.  Got on my inner thigh.  Yeah.  Wow.  Got some honor.  All right.  You have failed.  That's all right.  You came down.  You brought some ribs.  All right.  And the final guy in the first heat here.  What's your name again?  TJ, we got a drunken curve here or what?  No drunken curve, unfortunately. 
[02:48:00]  All right, TJ.  Just give it a toss.  Give it a shot.  He's swaying.  He reeks like looking.  Oh, God.  All over her back.  Back!  Come on, boys.  All right, so we got to move this long.  We got to move this.  All right, calm down, Jimmy.  Calm down.  You're right.  Everything's under control.  I know.  Get a hold of myself.  I've been doing this a long time.  All right.  She said I could.  She said I could lick it off.  Although seeing that white splatter on her back.  We let him lick it off.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, there you go.  All right, the drunk guy that brought the ribs will be licking his miss off the back of  the porn star.  Wow.  There you go. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, yeah.  Very nice.  That was good?  Yeah, the guy that hit the bullseye wants to lick his off, too.  He's going to have got in my ass.  Really?  What are you, a rookie?  I'm not licking that.  Did I hear I'm not licking that sweetheart?  Yeah.  Okay.  What a rookie.  So, a playoff between Linda and Artie.  Linda and Artie.  Let's go.  Let's get Linda back up there.  Wow.  5'10", 5'11", blonde, beautiful from opianthony.net.  Fishnets.  A great message board. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, they're fantastic.  For all your O&A needs, opianthony.net.  The two first bullseyes.  Yeah.  Right out of the gate.  Watch, we have no more for the rest of the day.  Yeah.  Hey, guys, could you stop eating the cherries?  Yeah, we need all those cherries.  I understand.  All right.  Here's Linda in the playoff.  She's aiming and.  Oh, wow.  Wide left.  What happened to that?  Wide left.  It is very wide.  It must have been beginner's luck.  Yeah, Kenny?  You think?  Yeah.  Very hard to follow up that bullseye with a shot.  All right.  Here comes Artie now. 
[02:49:30]  All Artie has to do is pretty much hit one of the girls and he wins.  Right.  Hey, that's right.  You might be using some strategy here, sir.  Newton.  Newton.  Newton.  Newton.  Oh.  Wow.  Hit the clint ring.  Hit the clint ring.  Yeah.  There's something you don't hear every day.  We got her in the hey nanny nanny.  The hey nanny.  That's it.  You are the winner of our first heat.  Artie will be sticking around.  He'll be in the finals.  There we go.  We have to say goodbye to everybody else.  Good job, Artie. 
[02:50:00]  Now, Artie, you hang outside.  Well, yeah.  Hang outside, I guess.  So we can hang out.  We'll get everybody else in here.  A new group.  A new group.  Guys, thank you so much for throwing the cherry darts.  Thanks for the food.  Thanks for the ribs.  Go Eagles on Sunday.  Beat those Packers.  Yes.  Stop eating the cherries.  Jimmy's breasts.  Thank you for the ribs.  All right.  Next five.  Next five.  The next five are making their way into the studio.  King Kong Bundy is just after the studio.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:50:30]  Is he going to eat somebody?  Here we are.  Gentlemen.  Very good.  Wow.  These guys.  You guys have been up all night, huh?  I can tell.  Yeah.  We've been waiting out front patiently.  Yes, patiently.  Have you boys been drinking at all?  No.  Look at him.  No.  A little bit.  Not really.  Just a little bit.  Damone.  No.  He's been hung over for three hours.  Three hours, you said?  All right.  Eric, why don't we mic the guys?  All right.  Who's our first thrower? 
[02:51:00]  I'm Andy.  Hey, Andy.  Where are you from, bro?  I'm from Pennsylvania.  You know where I'm from, actually?  You remember that girl, Ashley, that called up, and she said she was from Hazleton?  Yeah.  That's my town.  Hazleton.  So I was like, what?  But, yeah.  All right.  Cool.  I love it.  That's how that is.  I really lost steam.  Do you know her?  Yeah.  No.  She didn't go.  No.  She was a fake.  She's from Tennessee.  No.  She's cool.  Yeah.  She's a silly goose.  Okay.  So, Andy, you ready to throw a dart, or what?  You like our porn stars?  We've got Candy and Star on the lesbian couch.  Sure. 
[02:51:30]  Sure.  Why not, right?  Do you know where you are?  Bro, or?  You've got to take a cherry and dip it in whipped cream, fella.  All right.  He's picking out a cherry, Anthony.  He's got the whipped cream.  Dip it in whipped cream.  Are the girls ready?  We haven't talked to Star in a while.  You all right, Star?  She's a young, eager boy.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Star's ready.  We've got Candy ready.  Yeah, should we clean?  Clean up?  Clean up for round two?  Oh, yeah.  You might want to dab it out with something.  Oh, good idea.  Do you guys want to, who wants to be the official cleaner?  Not me.  They want to clean the belt?  I want a big shout-out for my wife, who I love very much. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, Candy won't go near it.  He's two feet away.  Yeah, they're all cleaned up, ready for the second heat.  Okay, they're getting all cleaned up.  I would be happy to do that.  With your tongue.  Oh, yeah.  They're helping each other out, Anthony.  Thank you.  That's so nice.  Good friends.  That's sportsmanship, if I've ever seen them dabbing, sopping it up.  All right, they're getting back into position.  Their balloon knots are nice and high and ready for Andy's toss.  He's got the dart, and...  Oh!  Oh! 
[02:52:30]  Horrible!  Nice throw, Bob Dole.  Jesus.  Andy waited three hours to do that.  That is a lousy throw.  Where did it hit?  It hit the couch.  It hit the couch.  All right, I can't see from here.  Isn't it great when they screw up, they're taunted by nude women?  Yeah.  Oh, what a lousy throw.  You stink.  All right.  Two open anuses just laughing at them.  Let's get to the next guy.  How you doing, man?  Hey, what's up?  I'm Dan from Long Island.  Hi, Dan.  Anything you want to promote, say...  I'm going to promote WeAreExtreme.com.  It's the t-shirt I gave you.  Oh, that t-shirt was cool. 
[02:53:00]  Anthony, I've got to throw you one, though.  Oh, what's that?  You ran away from us this morning, so...  Yeah, I did.  I ran upstairs.  I didn't want to deal with anybody.  You were scared of the drunken idiots, you know.  It was pretty funny, though, coming in at 5 in the morning and having all these lunatics.  Screaming and yelling.  WeAreExtreme.com.  Anything crazy happen out there this morning while you're waiting?  Nothing that crazy.  Well, someone wrote Little Prick on my car.  That's when you weren't looking, you know.  Yeah.  I gotcha.  Should have stopped.  Are you ready? 
[02:53:30]  I guess so.  Yeah.  I mean, I finally woke up, so why not?  All right.  Grab a cherry.  Dip it in the old whipped cream.  There you go.  And the girls are ready.  They're getting back in position.  Are you guys bored yet?  Not at all.  Not at all?  Of course not.  How terrific are these two?  I'm going to get bored with cherries being thrown into your ass.  I think we need a little more whipped cream on that cherry, sir.  I know your strategy is probably to keep it from being thrown off a little by the whipped cream,  but we need something to show up.  Just have fun.  That's all that matters.  Although you can, if you want, you can remove the stem.  He likes the stem. 
[02:54:00]  He likes the stem.  Using it like a dart.  All right.  Here he goes.  He's stepping up to the line, Anthony.  The girls are in position.  Every once in a while.  Yeah.  You can tell by that.  He's concentrating.  Oh.  Top of the chain.  Off the back.  Some of it hit the back of our head.  How hot was that?  Yeah.  It really was a nice sign.  Just right at the very top of the crack, where the crack starts.  Just to the right of that.  It went back into the left.  No, it's where it marks.  It's not where the cherry actually ended up.  The cherry's kind of sitting on her lower back now.  It's where it hits, and the initial point of contact. 
[02:54:30]  That right there is the winning.  It's in the lead so far.  As of right now, yeah.  As of right now.  The first guy hit the fucking sofa.  In the lead.  All right.  And King Kong Bundy is about to throw a cherry dart.  First one, Chip James Tagg.  I've never heard that before.  All right.  Or Gross Burger or Butterbean.  Oh, yeah.  Butterbean.  You're a cutie.  Thank you.  You do look like Butterbean.  You really do.  I love your cleaning products.  Yes.  All right.  If I get it near the hole and the explosion's knocking in, does it count? 
[02:55:00]  Caddyshack?  Oh, good.  All right.  Yeah, that was good.  Hey, is there anything you want to say or promote before you throw your cherry dart?  I guess me.  Philbin Transport.  I'm a courier.  What do you transport?  Whatever.  Envelopes?  His body.  Look at him.  Nothing.  His van got thrown off of 57th Street.  Did it?  They towed it?  No.  All right.  Tell them so to Kenny's in position as the official judge of cherry darts.  Here we go.  Eric's got the mic.  There we go.  And...  Oh!  Not bad. 
[02:55:30]  Nice shot.  Not bad.  Just missed to the right, I think.  Very close.  Exactly.  Let me get a measurement.  Let's get a measurement.  Kenny's going in there with the tape measure.  Kenny?  An inch and three quarters away.  An inch and three quarters.  Cool.  Very good.  You are in the lead so far.  So far, you're first, sir.  Very good.  Nice.  All right.  Let's move this along a little bit.  Who's up next?  All right.  I'm Kevin.  I'm from Carmel, New York.  How old are you, Kevin?  18.  Okay.  Cool.  You are a lovely young thing. 
[02:56:00]  You got pubic hair?  I saw you at Bananas a couple weeks ago.  Or a couple months ago.  Oh, thank you for coming, Kevin.  That was fun.  All right.  All right.  Did you buy a t-shirt?  You want to promote anything?  No, I'm good.  You just want to throw your dart?  Yeah.  I just came down there because I drove my uncle down, so I figured I'd have a good time.  Who's your uncle?  Uncle Matthew.  I love it.  Oh, there he is.  Okay.  I thought you guys kind of look familiar.  I dropped that out of school for the day.  I look alike.  Sorry.  Okay.  All right.  The girls are ready.  Kenny, I can't see with your large form in the way.  Star, how did that last cherry dart feel hitting your butt?  It was very nice.  I'm noticing the line is really getting pushed forward. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  Spanking.  All right.  He's young.  He's throwing left.  Wow.  Wow.  He got it in my armpit.  He hit the armpit.  Yeah.  He hit the armpit with a lot of anger, I must say.  Yeah.  That's the hardest throw so far.  Somebody got turned down for the prom this year, didn't they?  He almost hit my boob.  Fucking bitch.  Yeah.  I don't have any points for that at all.  Relax, Randy Johnson.  My God.  I thought it hit her in the face.  No, it hit her armpit.  Armpit.  All right.  Now the uncle's going to...  What's your name, uncle?  Frank. 
[02:57:00]  Hi, Frank.  Hey, Frank.  Uncle Frank.  Love your Uncle Frank.  All right, Uncle Frank.  Uncle Frank is going to have to move back a little there.  The line is where the doorstop is on the wall.  Come on, Frank.  There you go.  Yeah.  Here we go.  Oh!  Well, that was close, but it ain't no...  He's in three quarters.  It's the larger gentleman.  So far, the large gentleman has won this round.  He went for candy, and he just missed, huh, Kenny? 
[02:57:30]  Yeah.  Yes.  It's more than just.  Really?  Yeah.  He hit solid on the right cheek.  Lower right ass cheek.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, he's not in contention.  It looked like he was going right in there from my angle, but I guess not.  All right.  Well, um...  All right.  So far, we have Artie in round one, and what's your name, larger fellow?  Butterbean.  Pat?  Pat.  We've got to thank the other guys for stopping by.  Pat and Artie so far.  Any final thoughts from anyone?  Everyone's cool?  Are these guys getting stuff or waiting all morning?  Yeah, we've got other stuff to get. 
[02:58:00]  How about some t-shirts and stickers there?  All right.  All right.  We're going to go to round three.  I've got to leak, though.  Let's go in the bathroom.  Do Pat and Artie do the thing now?  No, no, no, no, no.  Oh, no, Kenny.  Kenny.  We wait until we have five semifinalists.  Right.  And then that's when we hold our final between those five.  We're going to do the third round of Cherry Darts for the My Five, the portable XM radio,  in a really quick break.  I just got to take a leak.  Okay.  Is that cool?  Go leak.  All right.  We're going to leak.  For seven cents a day, you can get Opie and Anthony. 
[02:58:30]  Or feed this little kid with the flies on his face.  But you want to laugh, don't you?  You don't want to be depressed watching starving children.  So turn them off and turn on Opie and Anthony.  And we'll send you a photo of the child you're helping in the outfit of your choice.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  What if you could give the ultimate Major League Baseball fan access to every team all season long?  Now you can.  The game that grew up on the radio joins the next generation of radio. 
[02:59:00]  XM is the official satellite radio network of Major League Baseball.  Here's the windup.  Every team all season long on XM.  Coming in 2005.  It's the perfect holiday gift for the Major League Baseball fanatic.  To check out and buy the latest XM radios, go to XMRadio.com.  Oh, what a game.  That's his first two.  Big Ten basketball.  It's the Big Ten today on XM Satellite Radio.  It's Friday, December 3rd, 2004.  I'm Maggie Linton with the Big Ten today.  Number one. 
[02:59:30]  Number one.  Well, we know who won't be number one next week.  Wake Forest.  After earning their first number one rank last week,  the Demon Deacons were stomped by the Orange Crush of Illinois 91-73 and the ACC Big Ten Challenge on Wednesday night.  Here's D. Brown from the left corner for three.  And it's good for D. Brown.  Here's Head.  Right baseline cut off.  Throws it out top to Powell.  Right wing for three.  He got it.  Watch for Powell. 
[03:00:00]  To the 3-1 basket.  Left wing driving in Darren Williams.  Right corner, Luther Head opens three.  Got it.  Boy, he is something else.  Luther Head with ten.  Ranked third on the coaches' poll and fifth by AP,  the Illini rolled behind the hot hands of Roger Powell Jr.,  who put up 19,  followed by D. Brown and Luther Head, both with 16.  Dominant in every phase,  Illinois led by double figures the last 28 minutes of the game,  up by as much as 32 at one point. 
[03:00:30]  The win extends their non-conference home court streak to 35 straight,  dating back to November 17, 1998.  Since the 2000-2001 season,  the Illini are 67-3 overall in Assembly Hall.  With a record of 5-and-zip,  Illinois will travel to Arkansas tomorrow  for an afternoon game against the 5-and-0 Razorbacks.  Basketball is my favorite sport.  I like the way to dribble up and down the court.  Illinois and Wisconsin were the only two Big Ten teams 
[03:01:00]  that came away with victories  after two nights of play against the ACC,  involving a total of 18 teams.  And that's the Big Ten today on XM Satellite Radio.  Big Ten! Big Ten!  Big Ten!

[03:02:00]  I just didn't want to be in the middle of the flight  and have him yank that handle hoping candy comes out  and blow the door off the plane.  We all get sucked out except for him  because his head gets stuck.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Go!  All right, we're just about ready  for the third round of Cherry Darts for the MiFi.  Everybody wants their hands on a MiFi, Anthony.  It is the gift this Christmas, isn't it?  We got lots of MiFis to give away.  Yeah.  We'll be doing something different next week. 
[03:02:30]  What'll that be?  Well, it's not going to be as hot as today.  I think it's the whole Rich Voss thing.  Oh, right.  Do you think that won't be as hot as today?  It gets disgusting when Rich Voss comes in  with his ear and his snot.  Oh, look at how lovely with the, uh...  Oh, cool.  All right, we got the judge, uh...  Oh, she's wearing one of my shirts.  We got an I Slept with Jim Norton  and all I got was this, uh, lousy T-shirt.  Lousy virus.  Oh, virus?  Yeah.  Very nice.  That's funny.  Thank you.  My version was not funny at all.  No.  T-shirt. 
[03:03:00]  Another lady in the studio.  We like when the ladies show up.  Yeah.  We don't want ladies to be scared of the O.P. and Anthony Show.  No, we're nice.  Okay.  I'm nervous.  You're nervous?  Yes, I am.  We don't bite.  Why?  Because.  What's your name?  Carolyn.  Hi, Carolyn.  Hi.  And what does this shirt say officially?  I slept with Jim Norton  and all I got was this lousy virus.  Very good.  You can get those at eatabullet.com.  Thank you, Opie.  You're welcome.  A little plug.  Club Soda Kenny is back in position.  Where is Sex Bagel?  Right here.  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.  There's so many people in here. 
[03:03:30]  I don't know.  That's right.  We're going to change his name, though.  Oh, Black Bag.  Stingray.  How you doing?  Shows up to everything.  I like that, though.  I'm actually showing up before work.  Really?  I'm going to rush there after this.  All right, cool.  Stingray is going to be the first contestant in the third round, Anthony.  Hi, Stingray.  From whackbag.com.  Cool.  The girls are back in position.  We got Candy and Star are porn stars.  Let's grab a cherry.  Grab one.  Candy's the 20-year-old porn star that wants to have a porn made with midgets.  With midgets. 
[03:04:00]  And so far, no midgets calling.  We told her we'd find her midgets.  Isn't that disgraceful?  I'm very, very upset.  They're probably all on a tree right now making cookies.  Stingray is about to throw his cherry dart.  Here we go.  Oh.  Small to back.  Small to back.  Yep.  Right there, the lower back.  And then it rolled up her back and down her back.  Yeah, that was kind of cool.  Right into the puddle.  Right into the puddle.  All right.  All right.  I don't think that's going to hold up.  It's not bad, though.  Well, everyone's got a pretty much miss. 
[03:04:30]  It's not bad.  He missed her whole ass, Ope.  Everyone's got a pretty much miss.  Yeah.  All right.  Who's it?  Wait.  Who are you?  Clark.  Hey, Clark.  Anything you want to promote, say?  Nah.  Jeffrey Dahmer Haircuts.com?  You just want to throw the dart and get the hell out of here, right?  Did you, uh...  All right.  I think he's married to this chick.  Yeah.  That's my wife.  Oh, you guys are married?  Oh, they're your wife?  Yeah, cool.  You want to cut off the head of a Loatian boy and paint it like a cherry and throw it in?  That'd be nice.  All right, cool.  Okay, here goes Clark.  He looks like him.  What a creep. 
[03:05:00]  Oh!  He went for star, Anthony, and...  He got closer.  He got the right cheek.  Right.  The right cheek.  Good job.  Hi.  High into the right.  Kenny, do you think you need to measure that, or...?  Well, he's got a good whipped cream mark, so...  Are you just going to keep it there?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Yeah.  And what's your wife's name?  Carolyn.  Hi, Carolyn.  Hi.  Carolyn, Brian.  Carolyn.  Well, Lynn, Brian Regan will be on the show next week when we go back to normal programming.  Very psyched.  This is normal.  Yeah.  Where? 
[03:05:30]  Anything you want to say?  Promote?  No.  What's a good technique here?  Are they swingers?  What's a good technique?  Some people take the stem off.  I think you're...  Yeah, throw it like a dart, basically.  It's kind of scary when people say, what's a good technique, because they usually get that  luck that gets in there.  We'll see if it works for you.  I would put my right foot forward on that line.  Put your left foot back a little.  Yeah.  There you go.  Yeah.  And now bend at the knees a little bit.  Yeah.  Wind up.  I think the leather jacket's going to get in the way, but...  Now just aim.  That's just me.  Just aim a little bit there and just give it a toss. 
[03:06:00]  Oh!  Wow.  She aimed for her head.  In her shoulder.  Just missed her head.  Yeah.  All right.  She hit the shoulder.  All right.  So far...  What's your name, fella?  Ricky.  Ricky?  Yes.  All right.  Young man with braces?  Yeah.  Where are you from, young Rick?  Yonk is Y.O.  Welcome.  Y.O., dude.  Wearing a shirt with a picture of Ben's living room carpet.  It's got a dump on it.  A big load of crap on his shirt. 
[03:06:30]  Holy shit.  Okay, cool.  It's shit with a halo.  What time did you get here this morning?  I got here at 6...  Like, not even at 5.30 this morning.  5.30?  Yes.  Just waiting online.  So much for the first 25 to show up.  The guys...  You know, there were guys out there...  No, no.  He's a whack bagger, so he got in.  Yeah, I'm okay.  Terrific guy for everybody on the board.  Oh, hi there, fella.  Okay, terrific.  Representing whackbag.com.  Very good.  All right.  Back up a little bit, sir.  Yeah.  Behind the bag there.  A little cheater.  And now give it your best shot.  Here it comes. 
[03:07:00]  Here he goes.  Oh, wow.  Skimmed off the top of the bar.  Grazed my ass.  A graze.  So, Clark's still in the lead, I do believe, right?  Okay.  Now, last up.  The last up for the...  Grabbing his cherry.  Third heat.  Is Doughboy from Whack Bag.  Hey, Doughboy.  Hi, Doughboy.  What's up, man?  Oh, the whole crew is here.  That's great.  Doughboy, you can pull this out.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't want to pull out.  I want to go on her back.  Good boy.  Oh.  Wouldn't that be pulling out?  Yeah.  Going on back?  I was going to say.  I think I totally screwed that line up.  Screwed up your...  Yeah.  Say, leave it in. 
[03:07:30]  What are you doing?  Fucking her shoulder blades?  I'm fucking her armpit, yo.  Axolism, if you need to know.  Okay.  Doughboy, here we go.  The girls are in position.  Eric, could you move, please?  Yeah, Eric.  Oh, wait a minute.  What happened, Ann?  What happened?  I think I saw a glancing blow off all over the vag.  Yeah.  Wait.  Yes.  I might have to call him on the line.  Now we have to measure.  Hold on.  You got to give a measurement.  Wait, Keith.  I might have to call him on a foul. 
[03:08:00]  He was over the line.  Oh, boy.  I might have to call him on a foul.  Oh, boy.  Wait.  You can't call him on a foul.  Get a measurement.  Get a measurement.  Candy, where did that hit you?  It's marked on the vag.  My right vaginal lip.  Wow.  Hey.  Good sense of...  She's like a Houdini-sensitive feel.  Yeah.  All right.  Kenny's the official judge.  He's a little confused.  He's measuring the mark on Star's butt on the right cheek.  Three and a half.  Three and a half inches.  Three and a half. 
[03:08:30]  Candy's getting in position, so you get a good mark.  Kenny's getting in there, taking his job very seriously.  And Doughboy wins with three and a quarter.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Three and a quarter.  I'll have three and a quarter.  Very good.  Wow.  That was some close competition.  So it's Artie, Doughboy, and what was the...  And the Pat.  And Pat.  Very good.  The fucking larger guy named Pat.  That awful name.  All right.  So in the final so far is Artie, Pat, and Doughboy.  And Patso. 
[03:09:00]  Artie.  Hey, Pat-ass.  Patso.  You Pat-fuck.  And Doughboy from whackbag.com.  All right.  You are awful.  All right.  We're getting ready.  Pat-tubber shit.  We're getting ready for the fourth heat.  The girls are cleaning off their areas so that the target is nice and clean.  Oh, my God.  Thank you, sweetheart.  We finally have a...  We got some soul into the studio.  Finally a non-white contestant.  That's the second non-white contestant.  A Nubian brother.  Good.  Obviously, he's going to win this heat, so we might as well move on to the fifth heat. 
[03:09:30]  You think?  He looks like Al Roker.  He ain't winning nothing.  He ain't winning nothing?  No.  He's all right.  No dunking.  Oh, you were at the event in Long Island.  Yeah.  That's how few black listeners we have.  I recognize a guy from four months ago.  They're out there.  They're out there.  They're second.  All right.  Wow, these guys are really big.  Holy shit.  Girls are wiping down.  Girls are wiping down for this heat.  Hey, buddy.  What's up?  How are you?  Good.  Good to see you.  Getting the other marks off of them.  All right.  Are we just about ready for the fourth heat?  The girls have wiped each other off. 
[03:10:00]  They're all wiped down very nicely.  All right.  They're getting ready to get back in position, and the fourth heat will begin in a second here,  Anthony.  Girls back on the couch.  There they go.  And who's first?  That's you.  Sir.  What's your name, bro?  Bill.  Hey, Bill.  Anything you want to promote?  Say no.  Nothing?  God, we give you guys an opportunity to do whatever you want on mic, and you do nothing.  All right.  He's honest, though.  He's not plugging anything.  Anything crazy happen outside while you're waiting?  No.  Not much. 
[03:10:30]  It's really cold.  Really cold.  Really cold outside.  Yeah.  That's about it.  Well said, Bill.  Let's cut our losses and throw the goddamn cherry.  Want to stand next to Steve and warm up?  You all right?  Okay.  All right.  Get your cherry dart.  Club son.  I can't see.  I'm going to move.  All right.  I'm just enamored by Bill.  Why?  No, because look at him.  He's Bill.  Yeah.  You do look like a Bill.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got that.  I know.  Fantastic.  Hopefully no one comes in with a real little bit.  Right.  Huh?  What is he saying?  Sure.  I went to school at Anthony. 
[03:11:00]  You went to school at Anthony.  Oh, you went to John Glenn?  Yep.  John H. Glenn High School?  Yep.  Out there in Elwood?  Elwood, yep.  Very good.  What year was that?  83.  83.  You almost said 60-something?  I don't know, right?  All right.  Calm down, Bill.  You're off by two decades.  I'm sorry.  How did that happen?  That's probably when he was born.  What are you, like 6'5", 6'6"?  6'5", yeah.  Wow.  What do you do for a living?  I work in computers.  Network tech.  Cool.  All right, Bill.  Where do I know you from?  I went to Cleveland this year.  That's where you're in Cleveland.  That's right.  Wow.  I knew I knew you. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Cool.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah, yeah.  Wonderful.  All right.  What are you saying?  I went to Cleveland.  Kenny, you all right with Bill?  You ready?  Yeah, I'm just, he works in computers.  I'm trying to imagine him in a suit and tie.  Big guy in a suit and tie.  All right.  Kenny, crouch down.  The girls are in position.  All right.  Get some cream on the thing.  Oh, yeah, you need some cream.  Star, how are you doing down there?  I know where to mark things.  You good?  Candy?  Wonderful.  Wow, he loaded that cherry up.  Are you feeling good, ladies?  You all right?  Both good?  Yeah. 
[03:12:00]  All right.  When's it your turn?  Probably later we're going to play for a listener.  Yeah, we're going to play for listeners as the grand finale to give away another MyFi.  Either one.  Yeah, you got a choice of two.  Oh, he's trying to get a lobbing.  All right.  At the middle of the lower back once again, Anthony.  He tried kind of a slow lob and a little too much height in it, I think.  All right.  He plopped right down on the lower back of stuff and now rolled off.  All right, Bill.  I don't know if that's going to be good enough, but I don't think that'll hold up. 
[03:12:30]  Let's see.  Our next contestant?  Mike.  Hi, Mike.  Hi, honey.  Anything you want to say?  You know, that's cool on the phone, but...  Yeah, in person, it's kind of creepy.  A little small Adrian from Rocky Glasses.  I'm going to dedicate my throw to my mother.  Oh, that's going to make mom proud.  That's an instant win right there.  What's wrong with your mom?  Huh?  Is there anything wrong with her?  Actually, yeah, but I'd rather not say on the air.  And this is how you...  All right.  She's not sick, is she?  I'm going to throw it out. 
[03:13:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  You got the open the can of worms.  What's...  Yeah, I'm going to...  All right.  Why would you dedicate throwing a cherry dart at a porn star's a-hole to your mom?  You've got to explain yourself.  Right.  She raised me to be a winner, so...  Got to get the cherry right in the asshole.  All right.  As mom would say.  Yeah. 
[03:13:30]  Those were her first words to me when I was born.  All right.  Cool.  You know, you do look like a winner.  Thanks, Ken.  All right.  So he's dedicating this throw to his mom.  His mom who has some horrible disease that he doesn't want to discuss on the show today.  All right.  Here he goes.  Oh.  He throws it with force.  Man.  Hits her in the left eye cheek.  That was like 90 miles an hour.  Obviously, you're a little pissed off at your mom.  Yeah.  Why are you so mad at mom?  Don't take it out on me.  Young man with abandonment issues. 
[03:14:00]  All right.  All right.  It's the left cheek.  It's pretty close to the brown eye.  Not a bad shot on star.  Kenny, you want to get in there for the official measurement?  Okay.  All right.  Star's bending over so Kenny can get an accurate measurement.  That tape measure in there.  And...  Kenny?  Four inches.  Four inches.  Four inches.  All right.  So far, that's the bet because Bill was about four feet.  Who's this tall guy?  John.  How tall are you?  Six nine.  Six nine.  Six nine.  Kenny, can you take him? 
[03:14:30]  He's an opposite of the midget.  He's a fat shit.  Oh, come on, Kenny.  I can take you.  What do you do for a living?  Do you install chandeliers?  No, I'm a student.  All right.  Anything you want to promote, say?  No, not really.  All right.  Big fan of the show.  Okay.  Grab the cherry dart and let's...  Good luck.  Just hoist it up there.  Go ahead, Goofy.  All right.  There we go.  You've got to crouch down, Kenny.  Put a lot of whipped cream on that cherry.  That's for sure.  Is he going underhand?  I think he's going underhand.  He's going for candy. 
[03:15:00]  Oh!  Just short.  Too short.  Taking quite a risk with that underhand throw.  A little bit on the leg, but...  A little on the leg.  Just missed the area.  Just missed the area.  All right.  All right.  So far, it's the young man who's doing it for mom.  Yep.  Let's move it along.  Mike, right?  Right.  Okay, Mike.  Mike?  Mike's in the lead.  Hey, buddy.  What's going on?  Hello, Mike.  What's your name?  I'm Joe from Miami.  Hi, Joe.  Oh.  How's it going?  Oh, yeah.  You didn't come here from Miami for this, did you?  No, no.  Not for this, but...  All right.  Some listeners do crazy crap like that, so I don't know.  I'm actually...  I'm from Hollywood.  Oh, hey. 
[03:15:30]  All right.  It's nice over there.  Anything you want to promote?  Say?  No.  I just want to say hi to my boys, Ed and Robert.  Okay.  Robert?  Queer.  I can't even talk.  It's okay.  Grab a cherry dart.  Let's go.  What are your friends, Ed and Robert, doing?  Sucking cock.  Yeah, sucking each other's probably right now.  Your friend Robert fucking a sink?  Good call back.  Of course.  Bob's telling you.  All right.  All right.  The girls are in position.  You ladies aren't bored, are you?  Oh, no.  Not at all.  You're enjoying yourself?  Very interesting.  We've got Star and Candy. 
[03:16:00]  We've got to feel it hit so they could clench.  That tattoo is great.  And here he goes.  He's got the dart in hand.  Oh.  Jesus.  Upper back.  Upper back.  Another one on the smaller back.  Right shoulder blade, Ed.  Yeah.  That one carried a little higher than I think you thought was going to carry.  You can see where the cherry edged it and hit Governor Connolly.  I'm supposed to believe that cherry then made a U-turn.  Remember your dying king.  Let's talk to the brother now.  Yeah, now our black friend.  Yeah, one of your two black listeners of the show. 
[03:16:30]  Why can't he just be our friend with the Rutgers hat on?  Rangers or Rutgers with the Rangers hat?  Why can't he just be our friend with the glasses?  Exactly.  Our friend who's reading challenged.  All right.  Oh, man.  Very inappropriate.  All right.  What's your name again?  My name's Justin.  I come from Long Island.  Yeah, we've seen him around a lot.  Yeah, he was at the ULS event.  All right, Justin.  Anything you want to say? 
[03:17:00]  Just go to somethingawful.com.  Something what?  Somethingawful.com.  Spell it.  It's something, S-O-M-E-T-H-O-N.  Something awful.  Something awful.  Yeah.  Okay.  You got to spell it because websites are spelled weird.  Did he spell it, though?  Well, he said something awful.  It could have been S-O-M-E-T-H-U-N.  He spelled it in ebonics.  It could have been something.  All right.  Something, something.  Something awful.  Let's go to babiesfather.com.  Is something spelled like white people spell it or how black people spell it? 
[03:17:30]  Yeah, like white people spell it.  All right.  Somethingawful.com.  Yeah.  How white people spell it.  And get your cherry.  All right.  Let's go.  Justin, you said?  Yep.  All right, Justin.  Mike's still in the lead, right?  This is the last guy in the fourth round.  Yes.  Fourth heat.  He's dipping his cherry in the cool whip.  Good luck, Justin.  He's very dainty.  He really is a delicate man.  Yeah, he doesn't seem too black to me.  I got it from a negro.  All right.  Here he goes.  Here's Justin.  What's his style, Anthony?  I don't know.  He's using this.  He's got a limp-wristed style.  Yeah, he's kind of banging. 
[03:18:00]  Like the black dude from Revenge of the Nerds.  What's going on out there?  I think he's using an underhand.  He's holding it by the stem.  By the stem.  Out in front of him, dangling.  Yeah, this is going to just be awful.  And then I think he's going to.  All right.  Now he's switching his throwing style.  It's the Clay Bertrand style.  Now he's a southpaw.  Oh!  Right in.  He just got the job.  That was a matter of value.  Just above the brown eye, right?  Right in.  You've got to give it to him.  He's the winner.  He is the winner.  Right above the brown eye in Kenny?  Wow.  Kobe would be so proud. 
[03:18:30]  It felt right on.  He slammed it right in.  It felt right on?  Good.  Yeah, right on.  Right on star.  Right on star.  A little above, but you know.  A little above, but close enough.  That's it.  Stealing the victory from this heat.  Justin, so far Justin, will be in the finals.  You're in the finals, son.  Which is going to start in minutes, right after this fifth heat.  Fifth heat?  Oh, Jim.  We picked too many people.  When you get a rookie like that.  Yeah.  It just feels right.  It's just awful.  He just completely turned around and was looking for your comments. 
[03:19:00]  Hey, what's up, man?  What's up, bro?  Cool.  How are you?  What's happening?  All right.  Are you guys all part of one gang?  Jesus.  It's like a boxcar just emptied out.  The Latin Kings just walked in.  A boxcar just emptied out.  What the hell?  They're terrible.  Don't you guys got lawns to mow?  Oh, wow.  Those are the Mexicans.  All right.  I'm sorry.  Those are the Mexicans.  We can't tell.  They all came in on the same pickup truck with grass clippings in their hair. 
[03:19:30]  No, they're busboys.  The restaurant's not open until lunchtime.  They were just standing at a 7-Eleven waiting for work, and one of our listeners drove by  in a pickup truck.  All right.  So who was our first contestant?  Yeah.  Velez.  Hi, Velez.  What's up, Velez?  Anything you want to say?  I represent the sexiest state, Redding, Pennsylvania.  Nice.  Pennsylvania.  How hot was that yesterday?  Hot.  That was hot, right?  Stuck it right in a turd cutter.  You have to love that.  Two-one.  Two-one.  Anything?  All right.  Cherry in, cherry out.  Anything crazy happen outside while you're waiting? 
[03:20:00]  I heard it was a...  There's a bunch of Mexicans acting nuts out there.  I don't know.  You guys are throwing up gang signs all morning.  They're throwing up gang signs.  Way to pick them, Steve, wherever you are.  Jesus.  I bet there's a Toyota Corolla in a parking garage somewhere close by, right?  Just got towed.  They just got towed.  They just got towed.  Did you guys get towed?  No.  Whoever's parked out front just got towed.  No, a guy did get towed.  He had to leave.  No.  All the way from Connecticut. 
[03:20:30]  Oh, and he got towed.  All right.  Well, get your cherry.  Let's go, Velez.  All right.  The girls are getting back in position.  Just have fun.  You might want to dip it in some whipped cream there.  Oh, you have to.  You have to.  Them's the rules.  You guys all left your knives outside the studio, right?  Yeah.  Okay, good.  Yeah.  And their hubcaps.  The machetes?  Nothing.  I like these guys.  They're all right.  Yeah, these guys don't care.  Here comes Velez.  Hey, back up a little there, sir.  Velez.  You got to get behind that line.  You're over the border.  There you go. 
[03:21:00]  Oh, my God.  Dude, are you seeing double?  Complete miss.  I think he's seeing double.  It was right between the two girls.  I'm going to have to pinch my helmet.  Right in the Rio Grande.  Oh, yeah.  All right, Velez.  I didn't get to get the job done.  Next.  Who's next?  John.  Hey, John.  Hi, John.  Anything you want to say?  Promote?  No, no.  I'm good.  Just hanging?  Yeah.  Welcome to the program.  Are you as scared of these guys as we are?  Not really.  They're kind of weird.  They're nice fellas. 
[03:21:30]  Of course.  Mara puto.  What does that mean?  I don't know, but it's not good.  Just nod and laugh.  All right.  They look like the band in From Dusk Till Dawn.  He's like, you're funny.  That's right.  It's just in my mind.  What?  Oh, cool.  All right, John.  You ready?  All right.  Hurry up before Los Lobos gets upset.  All right.  You could throw that into big pussy, little pussy, stinky pussy, tight pussy. 
[03:22:00]  I didn't know Carlos Masia could throw cherry darts.  Oh.  He hit the cheek, though.  That might be good enough.  You don't know.  You never know.  He got the hip.  At least he hit my ass.  Oh, wait, wait.  The side of the left cheek.  Velez did really well, right?  Where did Velez hit?  He missed.  Oh, in between them.  Okay, I'm good.  So, Velez is definitely out.  Okay.  All right.  So far, you're in the lead, son.  All right.  We got the first Chicano stepping up to the plate.  Very good.  No, Velez.  What nationality are you? 
[03:22:30]  He's Puerto Rican.  Oh, yeah.  He's Puerto Rican.  Yeah.  Velez is not an Irish name.  There we go.  You're right.  No, they all say they're from Puerto Rico because it's part of the United States.  For immigration purposes.  Am I supposed to introduce myself now?  Yeah.  What's your name, bro?  Alex.  Hi, Alex.  Where are you from, Alex?  Bronx.  Bronx?  What's your nationality?  Parents, Puerto Rican, me, American.  All right.  I like that.  We like hearing that.  All right.  We're all just Americans.  You've got to watch if they're Dominican.  They probably throw really well.  No, no, no.  I don't know that. 
[03:23:00]  Okay.  Anything you want to say?  You want to?  Not really.  I just want to throw the cherry at the ass.  Sure.  A Dominican wouldn't throw anything at the ass unless it was a balloon filled with heroin.  Candy liked that one.  Candy liked that one.  All right.  Grab your cherry.  I love candy.  Get that cherry and some whipped cream.  Kenny, you're not taking your job seriously anymore as a judge.  I am, but I don't want to block Norton's view.  Kenny's a good sport.  You'll run right in there with the tape measure after the toss?  Okay. 
[03:23:30]  Can you guys see?  Girls, you ready for this one?  I'm getting the pain in my groin.  That's fantastic.  All right.  Keep taking the line very seriously.  Oh, a nice throw, but...  You might have to measure between the cheek and that one.  You might have to measure there, Kenny.  Kenny, what do you think?  Kenny, we need you.  Where's the mark?  Where did it hit?  I can't see from here.  It's the outside of the right thigh.  Lower right thigh?  Yeah.  The right thigh.  All right.  Kenny's doing official measurement.  D-I-E.  Thigh.  Kenny, you've got to wrap the tape measure right around the box. 
[03:24:00]  I don't know.  Are we doing it in the wrap?  You have to.  You've got to push it right in there.  It's longer if you do that.  Yeah.  Well, it's longer, though.  It's as the crow flies.  Is it as the crow flies, or are you doing around the...  All right, we'll do it.  I've been doing it as the crow flies.  All right.  You've got to stay with what you've been doing.  Do it as the crow flies.  Right or wrong, that's fair.  That's true.  If you pictured it as a flat target.  Six and a half.  Six and a half.  What's the next one, Club Soda?  Eight.  Eight.  Wow.  Okay.  All right. 
[03:24:30]  So, Velez is still...  No, who...  The last guy's in the lead.  John?  John.  Yeah, John's in the lead.  Okay.  John is in the lead.  What's your name, sir?  Lewis.  Hi, Lewis.  What's up?  Where are you from, yo?  Long Island.  All right.  So, what nationality are you?  I don't know.  It's Hispanic or something like that.  It's not Lewis.  It's Luis.  No, not Luis.  Luis.  It's Lewis, man.  All right.  Come on, Lewis.  Do you want to say anything?  I hate the post office.  They really suck.  I hope all those old guys die. 
[03:25:00]  How is Brentwood these days?  Brentwood's really hardcore over there.  Cool.  Yeah.  Okay.  Good luck, Lewis.  He's got his drunkies t-shirt on.  Hates the post office.  Hates the post office.  He's getting his cherry.  All right.  Nice.  Strategically dipping it in the whipped cream.  Attaboy.  Get a good one.  All right.  Oh.  Stepping up to the line.  Let's make sure we're on the line, sir.  And then give it a little toss.  Girls are in position.  Taking his time.  Messes up. 
[03:25:30]  What is he doing?  He's like shaking off signals.  No.  He was praying.  Oh.  Damn.  Not going to get the job done.  Hard to ask God for help hitting an asshole with a cherry.  That's true.  Oh, God.  I tried.  Star, what do you think?  Huh?  We need to measure this one.  Yeah.  Oh, it hit right there.  Wait, that's where it hit?  Yeah.  It rolled up to my bag.  Oh, like a little pebble.  Wade, you might be in the lead after all.  Yeah, it's close.  Luis?  Six and a half.  So what's that mean?  Oh, still six.  Still John. 
[03:26:00]  That was close.  Oh, still John.  Okay.  That was close.  That was close.  Norton's really paying attention today.  Yeah, of course I am.  Very nice throw.  Two open anuses?  How do you not care?  He doesn't like the Mexican.  I hate Mexican.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right, this is going to be like a gang war in the studio if we don't hurry up with  this.  What's your name, sir?  Oh, Danny.  Hi, Danny.  Danny's wearing an I Stink hat.  Very nice.  Is that part of the Jim Norton collection?  No.  No?  No.  Love him.  We ought to sue like Gene Simmons now.  Yeah.  He just sues anybody that does anything having to do with it. 
[03:26:30]  Anything with Stink.  My credit's bad.  I can get off with this.  He's lost for doing his acting.  What are you saying?  I'll just sue him.  What are you saying?  My credit's bad.  I can't get anything off his website.  Really?  Yeah, I got a bad credit.  A bad credit.  He wants stuff, but his credit's bad.  Anything you want to say?  Oh, God.  Just want to say what's up to my job, and Doug, you're an asshole.  I hate you, you fuck.  Doug is an asshole, though.  Who's Doug?  We don't like Doug.  I'm a fucking assistant supervisor.  He's a fucking fag.  That's true.  What do you do for a living?  Doug throws a punch like he takes the ass.  What?  I work for Honeywell.  Oh, Honeywell?  Yeah.  Love your thermostats. 
[03:27:00]  Anthony, the girls are courtesy of Joe at BlackMirror.com.  Yeah.  Oh, a cherry came flying by my head.  Why are you throwing cherries?  He told me to.  Yeah, she can.  She asked if she could, and I said, of course.  Oh, okay.  Hot chick wants to throw a cherry.  I was wondering if she was pissed off.  I'll do whatever the fuck I plead.  I was just wondering if you were pissed off.  That's all.  I don't care.  You can throw the TV monitors.  Yeah.  Zach, aren't we?  Yeah, whatever.  All right, here we go.  The last guy of the last heat.  The final heat before the championship.  Oh.  That's it.  Yeah, you threw that a little too hard. 
[03:27:30]  It's Joe, right?  John.  John, I'm sorry.  John's in this round.  All right.  John's in the finals.  We have our five finalists who will now compete in one last.  John, Justin, Pat, Artie.  What?  Are you kidding me?  No, we did one, two, three, four.  We said 25.  We did 25 already.  Those guys are out.  Oh.  We can't change the rules.  We'll get in trouble for changing the rules.  We'll run out of show.  And we're running out of show.  Yeah. 
[03:28:00]  You got to give them something for coming, though.  Oh, we will.  Yeah, we'll take care, everybody.  Well, guys, thank you so much for playing Cherry Darts.  Guys, thank you.  John, stick around.  You're in the finals.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Very cool.  Thanks, guys.  We really appreciate it.  Did I have a date with one of the porn stars?  Huh?  You got to see some hot ass.  I don't get to see that.  I don't get to see that at the post office.  No, huh?  I see these old guys every day.  Yeah, of course.  I tell you, I'm spraying the virus on my job.  I want to take one of the porn stars.  Spread the virus, my friends.  Spread the virus.  She has a nice, though. 
[03:28:30]  She does have a nice, though.  All right.  No reason to take a break, right?  It's a mess already.  We'll just continue.  Sure.  Bring them in.  All right.  Here come the finalists in Cherry Darts.  Who's this guy?  Who's that?  Oh, this is Joe.  He's Joe Galon.  He brought the girls in.  Thank you.  This is...  Yeah, there you go.  All right.  From Black Mirror.  Yeah, Joe at Black Mirror.  He brought the girls in.  Fine job.  Great job.  Our fans all coming in.  Our athletes coming into the studio.  Yeah, we need the Olympic music at this point. 
[03:29:00]  See, that would have been good if we were actually producing the show today.  The Olympic fanfare music.  Huh?  Laying the odds.  I'm going...  I'm going with Artie.  With the Italian Villa.  Yeah, Artie.  Pizzeria guy.  Artie's got to be the favorite coming into the finals.  Yeah, Artie the favorite.  Coming into the finals.  If you remember, Opie, first heat, first guy steps up and just sinks a bullseye, then later  confesses that he is a dart player.  He plays on a dart league and bought some cherries and was practicing all night. 
[03:29:30]  So, this guy, pretty much the favorite.  But let me ask you this.  He looks like he's anxious to go first.  Do you think that's a good strategic move?  Doesn't matter.  He don't care.  Well, I think if he gets a good throw, it kind of sets a tone.  It kind of intimidates the other players that they then have to top what he did.  If it's a bad throw, it could work against him.  You're absolutely right, Anthony.  Opie, comment?  I was too busy staring at the naked girls.  I have no idea what you guys were saying.  All right, so we're ready.  We are...  I really was. 
[03:30:00]  I have no idea.  What were you saying?  No, it doesn't matter anymore.  I was babbling.  Are you girls ready?  It's a real sporting event.  Candy and star?  Beautiful.  Yeah, this is for the MiFi.  The girls are getting back in position.  The grounds crews have taken care of cleaning.  Yeah, because we have to throw after for a listener, right?  Yeah, we'll do that for another MiFi.  For someone who can't make it in for another state.  Correct.  They're getting...  Well, if you want to win a MiFi, you've got to call the show right now.  And I think five of us are going to represent listeners from all over the country for another MiFi.  Okay, once for every state?  Yeah, definitely.  Wow, very strategic with the whipped cream on the cherry. 
[03:30:30]  He wants just the right amount there.  Let's clear his...  Wait, what's wrong?  What's the matter, Keith?  Keith.  Linda, although she didn't make the finals, was hoping she could show her ass and weasel her way into the finals.  Yes.  Oh, well, it'll be up to the guys.  If she shows her ass...  Yeah!  No, no, no, no.  No, guys, it's...  Wow, no, no.  Oh, my God.  What?  I want to see ass.  This is competition for a MiFi.  Doughboy most certainly wants to see ass.  Wait, wait, she has one fishnets. 
[03:31:00]  Are they thigh highs or are they stockings?  They're stockings.  Very lovely.  Linda's very hot.  5'10", 5'11", blonde.  Beautiful.  And she wants to show her ass to get in the finals.  You know.  The guys don't want it.  No, no.  The guys...  I wasn't close.  I got a bullseye.  Yeah, she did get a bullseye, too, you know?  It's up to the guys.  They're afraid that a woman's going to beat them.  That's the problem.  They're afraid that a woman's going to win the competition.  I'll give her my MiFi if I win.  What if she does it naked?  The finals naked.  She won't do it naked.  What if she, uh...  What are you, her fucking agent? 
[03:31:30]  No, she just said no.  Stop it?  She said no.  Yeah, we could hear her.  She won't do it naked.  No, no, no.  I won't permit it.  I don't care if she does it naked, but she said she wouldn't.  Look at him.  I'm representing her.  No more questions.  Can we just see her ass anyway?  Yeah.  I hope so.  I want to see her ass.  Anyway?  I know, I know.  Look, I was with you.  I was with you.  Yeah, rules are rules.  Now, no one...  Everyone wants to see her ass.  But, rules are rules.  We have our five finalists, and I think it would be, uh...  All right. 
[03:32:00]  You know.  Well, it was a great idea, though.  Oh, well.  You're not asking Pat to see his ass and let him, uh...  Maybe take two shots?  Yeah.  I'd rather probably see that than his awful skull.  Hey!  I was just thinking because I got a bullseye, maybe I could...  Look, I'm with you.  Let it be known I'm not a fag.  If these guys want to be fags, that's their business.  All right.  Well, let's get the finals over with for the first MyFi, Anthony.  Sorry, Linda.  I thought the idea was great.  Girls, we must adhere to the rules.  Any final thoughts from the girls as we go into the finals? 
[03:32:30]  We got Candy who wants to do midget porn.  Have we had any midget callers yet?  No.  Don't worry.  We'll take care of that on another show.  We'll get it.  I'm very upset.  We'll get that done for you.  Well, the second we find a horny midget, we're calling you.  That's right.  Don't worry about it.  And Star?  Definitely.  Good luck, guys.  All right.  Good luck, guys.  Good luck.  What do you want to hear from a porn star there?  Artie is getting his cherry ready.  Artie, any final thoughts?  This is it right here, buddy.  The finals for the MyFi.  He's good.  He's in the zone. 
[03:33:00]  He's in the zone.  Oh, wow.  Look at his eyes.  He's focusing.  Swing, batter.  Swing.  Here we go.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  That's not bad.  Not bad.  It went a little high.  It went a little high on him, he's Billy.  It's the top of the crack.  Yeah.  Maybe about an inch down from where the crack starts.  Official measurement.  Three and three quarters.  Three and three quarters.  Three and three quarters.  Inches, not bad.  Not a bad throw.  I think that's who he took to beat, Anthony.  He's a little disappointed.  I understand.  What happened with that throw?  I got a little too overanxious.  You got a little too overanxious. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah.  You kind of threw it a little high.  A little hard.  Okay.  Somebody keeping the stats?  What is it?  Three and three quarters.  All right.  Three and...  That's already...  3.75.  Three, three...  Three, three quarter inches.  All right.  There we go.  Who's up?  Doughboy from...  Yeah, Doughboy, of course, from whackbag.com.  So let's go for less than three and three quarters.  Yep.  That's all you have to say.  That's what you're done for.  This is it.  Okay.  He's preparing his cherry.  Girls arching very nicely, Anthony, giving the guys a really good target at this point.  Now that these guys are seasoned veterans of the game, they're taking a little 
[03:34:00]  more time preparing their cherry.  Yes.  Standing behind that line.  Doughboy is sizing up the target.  Lean over and...  He's going for star, Anthony.  He's going for star.  Oh!  No, right cheek.  Right cheek.  Right cheek.  On that one.  Far right cheek.  Let's get a measurement.  Well, maybe not, though, Anthony.  Let's get a measurement.  He might get in the side door here.  Nope.  Club Soda Kenny, official judge of cherry darts.  Uh-oh.  It's close. 
[03:34:30]  Uh-oh.  What does this line mean?  Oh, Christ.  You can't even read a tape measure.  What is it?  Sixteenths.  Three and...  Nine sixteenths.  Nine sixteenths.  That's a little over three and a half.  Three and...  Three quarters.  Three quarters.  Three quarters is a half.  Right.  No, no.  That would be...  That would be...  Was it past...  Oh, no, no, no.  Three quarters, thirteen sexteenths.  It's out.  So, those...  Yeah, then the other guy.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  I want to remeasure.  Is that an official measurement?  Yeah.  I just couldn't read it.  Hey, you know what, Kenny? 
[03:35:00]  What?  Doughboy wants to...  You tell Doughboy what you think of his...  He wants you to remeasure.  Remeasure?  No.  Absolutely not.  All decisions of the judges are final.  Exactly.  So, get your dough, boy.  That is...  I understand your disappointment, but it is a game of inches and fractions of inches.  Yes.  Very sorry.  Already still in the lead with three throwers left.  Good throw.  Who's up, though?  Who's up?  Who's up?  Looks like it's... 
[03:35:30]  What?  John, that's right.  I'm sorry.  John is stepping up now.  Okay.  Any final thoughts, John?  No.  Okay, this is for the MiFi.  He's got his cherry dart here?  Yes, he does.  Oh, wait, wait.  You're way ahead of the line there.  Behind the line.  Behind the line, sir.  Behind the line, Angel.  That's that thing.  Mike the girls.  That's that thing.  Right on it.  Behind it.  Yeah, there you go.  All right.  He's going for...  He doesn't know who he's going for.  No.  So, he goes for nobody.  Wow. 
[03:36:00]  He panicked.  Yeah, a little panic when it happened there.  Oh, and then he's just walking out.  Dude, don't be...  It was worth it just to meet you guys.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you, sir.  Beat it, you choking zilch.  He's used to handling rejection.  Jesus.  All right.  Get his hopes up.  Just out.  I'm going in the directions.  I'm just ready.  All right, Justin.  All right, Justin, the black fella.  Yep.  Very common name for a black guy, Justin.  Well, he's as white as Earl.  He better go.  All our black guys are real white.  We got white black guys.  Here he goes. 
[03:36:30]  All right, ready, Justin?  He's stepping up the line.  Justin, who are you going to go for?  He's in the zone.  He's not even listening.  He doesn't even want to.  All right, so he's lining up.  He's aiming now, holding that cherry close to his eye and taking a stance.  Oh!  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Wow.  Did you see what Star did when she got hit?  It's real close to the balloon knot.  One and three quarters.  One and three quarters.  She clinched up and went, whoa.  Hit her right in the snatch.  So far, Justin is in the lead. 
[03:37:00]  We have to say goodbye to Artie.  Bye, Artie.  Artie's out.  Artie's out.  It comes down to Patso.  Pat fuck.  Patso.  Wait, I want to talk to Star.  How did that feel, Star?  It was very nice.  It was nice, huh?  It was a nice smack.  Where did it hit?  You know, right in the vagina.  The vag, right?  Yeah.  Kind of in the whale's eye.  In the tank.  That was a good one.  It was kind of a taint shot?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look at Kenny.  Yeah.  That was a good one. 
[03:37:30]  All right, we got Pat.  He's getting his cherry ready.  Jesus, Pat.  No, I've got to do more than that.  Yeah, you've got to put a little more.  I don't know if he has to, if he doesn't want to.  If he doesn't want to.  No, you weigh it the way you want to.  That's right.  If it doesn't leave a mark, you're going to be screwed.  So that's the chance you take.  We're going to make a visual judgment if there's no mark.  Too big of a mark.  Right, and you might lose on the measurement.  Good call.  All right.  This kid's got his strategy.  All right, here he goes.  This is Pat.  This is for the MiFi.  Here it is.  So far, it's Justin.  Here it is.  He misses.  It's Justin's MiFi. 
[03:38:00]  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Holy crap.  This is close.  Pat might have just pulled it out.  That might be a measure off.  Can he?  Two inches.  Justin wins?  Oh, wow.  The black guy wins the MiFi.  The black guy wins by a half inch.  Great throw, Pat.  What a shock.  In the end, almost pulling it off.  Justin?  I don't fucking believe it.  Yeah.  I didn't even expect to fucking win shit.  What do you got to say to all your baby's mamas out there? 
[03:38:30]  Oh, fuck them all.  Congratulations, Justin.  I'm saying the winner isn't.  The winner isn't.  Golfer.  You sound a little taller with a cherry in your hand.  You know, the funniest thing, I actually pre-ordered MiFi at Circuit City, but now I guess I'm going  to cancel it.  All right.  Wow.  You want to thank God?  Nothing?  You're all set?  Yeah.  Thank the Lord.  Pat, any final thoughts for losing?  You came real close.  It really sucks. 
[03:39:00]  You were like, wow.  That's what she said.  Half inch.  It came close.  Why are you rubbing Pat's back, Justin?  American Idol.  I'm starting to...  Yeah.  I can't believe the...  All right.  So...  Wow.  This is incredible.  It's just amazing that the...  All right.  So we won.  You know where you can say it?  I don't give a shit.  It's just amazing that the...  Was anyone else surprised that the...  Oh, Jesus. 
[03:39:30]  The nice gentleman won.  Won the MiFi?  Justin, congratulations.  Justin.  Congratulations.  Thank you for playing Cherry Darts.  What are you going to do now?  I'm shoplifting at Disney World.  I'm damn straight.  All right, Justin.  We'll see you around, obviously.  We see all these guys around.  Of course.  Pat, we'll see you around.  Thanks for playing Cherry Darts.  All right.  There he goes there.  You want to take a really quick break, and then we'll give out another MiFi to a listener

We're going to take a quick break, and then five of us will throw darts at Star and Candy  for another MiFi.  Each representing a listener from out of town.  Yeah.  We're all going to pick someone on the phone line, okay?  How exciting.  And who's going to throw?  I'm throwing.  Ann's throwing.  Norton's throwing.  We need two more.  You. 
[03:41:00]  No, I'm in.  Believe me, I've been known to choke and everything, but I was on a dart league.  Well, we've got to get, like, Kenny's a judge.  I'm the judge.  Sex bagel?  He's holding the mic, but he's...  He wants to do it.  He wants to do it.  The guy in the corner.  Yeah?  Well, we need guys from the show, though.  Yeah, he can do it any time.  I mean, yeah, we'll promote.  Too bad Ben wasn't here.  He could eat one and shoot it out his ass.  All right, we'll figure it out next.  We'll take a real quick break.

[03:43:30]  Not sold in stores, Jan, because it's a piece of shit.  What if it's right under the bed where it'll be forever?  No D-track.  Where's the glider?  That thing that goes back and forth like that?  I got the idea by smoking a lot of pot.  And then I slid across the mnolium floor to get some Captain Crunch, and that's where I came up with a lazy fuck. 
[03:44:00]  My aerobic system...  I meant...  I meant Billy Blanks.  Remember what Billy Blanks got?  Come on, man. Let's go. Come on. Yeah.  Those girls. Come on. Yeah.  Yeah.  That guy looks like a crook. He should have a crime aerobics or some shit.  Let's run for the police, everybody.  Let's run for the police.  There you go. Run for the police.  All right?

Speaking of animals, of course, the news, I guess, of the month or maybe even the year now is that sheep that they cloned.  They're cloning animals and they're talking about maybe they can clone humans, which I think is a good idea.  Because I would like to clone myself. 
[03:45:00]  Because I would like to have sex with myself.  Hey, I know what I like.  I'm going to have a lot of fun and save a lot of time.  I'm going to have a lot of fun and save a lot of fun. 
[03:45:30]  Check out XM41.  Dump on your.  About me.  Many young wives feel squeamish at the form of swallowing seeds.  Why?  Indeed, a man's jackalip is full of valuable purposes. 
[03:46:00]  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  I want to stop an egg jackalip.  That's hot.  I got blood rushing in my mule right now.  That is so hot.  A lot of fun today, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  Cherry darts for my five.  Very successful.  We got one more to give away.  I think we have a total of like six or seven of these things to give away.  So we can do another one today, I believe, huh?  Justin, time for Christmas.  Might as well.  We got the porn stars here. 
[03:46:30]  Candy and star.  We got the cherries and we got the whipped cream.  What's up, Jim?  Who's growing?  And I and you definitely.  And then the listeners.  I think what's going to happen is we're going to plunk the phones down  and then the listener decides who they want throwing for them.  Okay?  You got to pick Anthony, myself, and Norton,  and then two others that are associated with the show.  Yep.  Now, you want to give a little, you know, pump yourself up a little bit?  I know you could say you hit a bullseye last time you did this.  And from a lot further away, by the way. 
[03:47:00]  Was it?  Yes, a lot further.  Yeah, definitely, dude.  We did about 15, 20 feet last time.  We had a bigger studio.  Okay.  I remember it was pretty impressive at the time.  All right.  So that's what you got going for you.  We were going for the front door, you know, which was a little bigger target.  Jimmy?  What's your prowess on this?  I have the dexterity of a stroke victim.  So don't pick me.  You could have that fluke, the long shot, the beginner's luck kind of thing.  And, Anthony, I know you're a dart player.  I was on the dart league and, you know, got that aim thing.  I would have to go with you as the favorite here. 
[03:47:30]  No, Opie, I would have to go with you.  You prove.  I insist, my friend.  You're the favorite.  You have proven that you can do this.  Also want to say hi to Joe at BlackMirror.com, right?  You brought the girls in.  Thank you very much.  And anything you want to promote real fast before we do this for the last MiFi?  Well, I just want to tell everybody that we're very glad to be here.  And I love these guys.  I love them since before they were off.  And now they're back on.  It's a great thrill.  And Black Mirror's got seven AVN nominations.  And Star is in, I think, three of the productions that are AVN nominated. 
[03:48:00]  And we'll see you all in Vegas at the AVN Expo.  Oh, yeah.  I think we're broadcasting from there.  Yeah, we are.  So we're going to hang in Vegas.  Oh, very cool.  Okay.  Congratulations.  Sending the Opie and Anthony show to the porn awards.  Yeah.  Anthony, our first...  Midget?  No.  Oh, son of a bitch.  We're going to get midgets.  We will get midgets for Candy's porno that she wants to do.  You goddamn midgets.  We'll get them.  Where are you?  She wants to bang midgets for a porno.  This is the first time anyone's ever wanted to talk to one so they don't know how to handle it.  No one's ever asked for them before.  Okay, here we go.  Or she wants to hurt them. 
[03:48:30]  We've got to pick contestants now from all over the country, Anthony.  Keith from Texas.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  You want to win a MiFi?  I sure do, man.  Okay.  Who do you want...  What's up with Jimmy?  Huh?  What's up with Jimmy?  I bet he wants to dive in for a morning snack, huh?  Yeah.  I'm really turned on.  Sure, he does.  Oh, yeah.  Who do you want to throw for you, mister?  I'm going to go with Opie.  Okay.  Opie.  There you go.  Thank you, Keith.  Let's try to go with the blonde.  All right.  Hold on the line.  You are definitely in. 
[03:49:00]  Anthony, which...  Oh, I don't care.  Just plunk it down.  Oh, okay.  Let's do this one.  Cody from Buffalo.  What's up, Cody?  Not a thing, boys.  What's going on?  You want to win a MiFi?  Of course you do.  Sure do.  Okay.  Who do you want thrown for you?  I want little Jimmy because he's good at finding the balloon snack.  All right, Cody.  Ah, little Jimmy.  Well, Cody...  Am I going to be the guy in the gym class that has to stand there, the last guy picked?  No.  Pick me, please.  I could play softball. 
[03:49:30]  Let's go to Denver and say hi to John.  John.  Yo.  John Denver?  What?  John, who do you want throwing for you?  I think I'll take Anthony.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, wow.  All right, buddy.  Representing the fine state of Colorado.  Colorado.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Hold on the line until we get to you.  I got Buffalo.  The JonBenet state, I guess.  Lucky job.  Let's see.  We got two more.  Hmm.  Let's say hi to Kansas.  We don't get many calls from Kansas.  Jeremy.  Yeah, what's going on?  Hey, bro.  You want to win a MiFi, obviously. 
[03:50:00]  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Who do you want throwing for you?  Well, I don't know.  Who's the other two?  Whoever you want from the show.  Well, you got Keith the Cop.  You got Martini Steve.  You got Sex Bagel.  You got my brother, who's a really good athlete.  You got four interns.  Athlete.  Like, there's any athleticism needed whatsoever.  I'd like to say that I am a pistol marksman.  Oh, that's true.  All right, calm down.  That's all right.  If you're going to shoot her in the ass, you'd be a favorite.  And Master Poe, maybe?  That's right. 
[03:50:30]  Who do you want there?  Who's Master Poe?  Can Master Poe throw?  Of course he can.  Or is he too serious out there?  Yeah.  It might be like the end of Karate Kid, where he comes in, gets in the crane position, and  lops that cherry in.  How mad is he going to be to lose to some unathletic ass like myself or somebody else?  That's true.  He might have to kick your ass.  All right, Jeremy, you got Master Poe?  Right on.  He can throw, right?  You can throw?  Oh, he's smiling for once.  Look at that.  You're going to throw? 
[03:51:00]  Yeah, nice.  All right, Master Poe's in.  Feel like your paperwork?  And finally, our last contestant for the last MyFi.  Let's go to North Carolina.  Johnny, what's up?  Morning.  How are you, buddy?  I'm pretty good, fellas.  Great show, man.  It's a little weird today, but every day, we give you a different type of show.  Yeah, I got my seven cents worth.  Good.  All right.  Johnny from North Carolina, who do you want thrown for you for the MyFi?  I'm going to have to go with Steve, because I know he's got Steve. 
[03:51:30]  Oh, we call him Cherry's Flambe.  It's true.  All right, Martini Steve.  Okay, we got game on, girls.  Game on.  Let's do it.  All right.  We only have like six minutes left in the show.  Oh, geez, and you know we can't go along, so let's get this done.  All right.  Who's up?  Who's up first?  Who wants to be first?  Master Poe is up.  Master Poe is digging in.  Stepping up.  Grabbing a cherry.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'm getting a little nervous here now.  Okay, hold on.  Pressure's kind of on.  All right. 
[03:52:00]  Jeremy from Kansas.  Yeah, what's going on?  Okay.  Master Poe has his cherry dart.  It's dipped in the whipped cream.  He's stepping up to the line.  We got the really hot porn stars bent way over this time.  Master Poe, a lot of discipline.  Yep.  With his martial arts, so that could come into play, I think.  Master Poe, how are you feeling?  Very disciplined thrower.  This is different than throwing knives.  I just want you to know.  All right.  Come on.  But you still have the discipline.  Wow, look at the girls.  They're really arching for us.  The patience to take the shot. 
[03:52:30]  Okay.  Master Poe has stepped up to the line.  We got to ask him, how's his chi?  Oh.  All right.  Oh, he's doing overhand.  Yeah, I don't know what he's doing.  I don't take a look.  Looks like he throws like a girl, actually.  He's throwing like a knife fighter.  I don't know what he's doing.  Oh.  Wow.  Jeremy.  Jeremy, you picked the wrong guy.  Let's just put it that way.  Jeremy, it went right between both of them.  Did you practice?  Oh, no.  No practice shot.  We're running out of show.  Jeremy, hold on the line.  You never know.  You never know.  There goes Jeremy from Kansas. 
[03:53:00]  No, there's no practice.  All right.  That's it.  Martini Steve, you're up next.  Martini Steve.  Good luck, Steve.  Johnny from North Carolina.  Come on.  You got to root Martini Steve on.  Steve, you got anything to say?  Nothing.  Come on, Steve.  Fire it in there.  Steve is winding up.  The girls are ready.  And...  Oh.  Where'd that go?  Let's get a measure.  Johnny from North Carolina.  Inner thigh.  We do have a mark on the inner thigh.  Kenny's moving in for the measurement.  Martini Steve stinks.  Four and a half. 
[03:53:30]  Four and a half inches.  Four and a half.  Four and a half.  All right.  You know what?  Johnny, you're in the lead.  So hold on the line.  We're going to have to say goodbye to Jeremy from Kansas.  Jeremy, sorry.  All right.  All right.  Thanks for playing.  You got me after, Poe.  All right.  Do you need to take Viagra first?  Hold on.  Hold on, Jimmy.  Hold on.  All right.  Cody from Buffalo.  You want to root Jimmy on?  Yeah.  Come on, little Jimmy.  All right.  Jimmy's ready.  The girls are ready.  Here we go for a Mi-Fi.  Oh, on the thigh.  The back of the thigh.  Where did it hit?  Back thigh? 
[03:54:00]  Yeah.  It looked like it was going to be a good shot, but it took a dive right at the last minute.  All right.  Kenny's measuring it, Cody.  Let's see what happens.  Stunk.  Not close enough.  Nope.  I'm giving him tie with Steve.  Tie?  Tie.  Really?  What?  It would be a shoot-off if neither one of us gets close enough.  All right.  Maybe me and Steve can just kiss and settle it.  And you're going?  All right.  Anthony's stepping up.  Let's just start now.  I'll take the shot.  He's representing John in Denver.  John?  John Denver.  John Denver, yes.  Anthony is dipping his cherry into the whipped cream.  It's going to make your fingers nice and sticky, too. 
[03:54:30]  Be the ball.  Be the ball.  No, no, no.  Put it behind your legs.  Be the ball, Anthony.  He's saying, be the ball.  Yes.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Wow.  Anthony's really preparing his cherry.  Good luck, Ant.  I know why I am.  Just have fun.  You know, John, I think you picked a winner.  I think Anthony's a ringer here.  The girls are ready.  Anthony's stepping up to the line.  Yeah, this is weird.  I know it's weird.  It's weird.  It's an anus in front of you.  And...  Uh-oh!  Too low.  Oh, no.  John, another inner thigh.  I don't even think it's close.  No. 
[03:55:00]  So far, it's between me and MS.  Six inches.  All right, six inches.  John, we've got to say goodbye to you, okay?  All right, you've got to take care of you.  All right.  All right.  Anthony, talk to Keith from Texas.  I've got to step up.  All right, good luck, Opie.  Keith.  Keith from Texas.  All right, so far, it's between me and MS.  Come on, Opie.  Opie now in the position where he could really pull this one out for you.  He won't.  It's a tough shot.  I'm nervous for some reason.  I notice it gets a little sticky and kind of sticks on your finger.  Yeah.  So it's a tough shot. 
[03:55:30]  Just try to put it in there.  Opie holding it by the stem.  This is what these guys are looking at.  Are they insane?  I know.  It's wonderful.  A little rough.  I can't shake it.  Opie getting on, standing up to the line.  There you go.  Grabbing that cherry.  I'm going for candy.  He's leaning, going for candy.  It's a tough shot.  He's keeping the stem on the cherry.  It's going to bounce right off her spine.  Trying to throw it like a duck.  No.  To the right of the thigh.  Ready for a tiebreaker.  That wasn't in.  It's going to be a tiebreaker.  I let you down, Keith. 
[03:56:00]  Oh, man.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Go ahead, Martini, Steve.  I'll throw it first, whatever you want.  I thought I had to wind up nice.  Oh, you have to go because you went first before.  You guys got to hurry.  We got what?  Two minutes left in the show?  Two and a half minutes?  All right.  Let's do it real quick, sweetie.  All right.  All right.  Don't rush yourself.  No, don't rush yourself.  We do have plenty of time.  You don't have to eat it.  It's not an olive.  All right.  This is the playoff for the MiFi.  It's between...  Oh, let me get Johnny on the line.  Johnny in North Carolina.  Martini, Steve has stepped up to the line for you there, buddy. 
[03:56:30]  Here we go.  You're smoking hot, baby.  Oh, Steve.  Not even close.  It's a clean miss.  It arced and went between her legs and hit the couch between her knees.  All Norm has to do is hit one of the girls.  Wait.  Hold on.  Oh, and he gets her on the ass.  And we have a winner.  Cody?  Jimmy didn't even wait.  He stepped up to the line.  No, I'm sorry.  I just wanted to throw just to be silly.  It's okay, but Cody from Buffalo, you have won a MiFi courtesy of Jim Norton's fine cherry 
[03:57:00]  dart throwing.  Bravo, Jimmy.  Oh, it was a fun competition.  I felt like I was ready.  It was good.  Yeah.  My fingers are sticky.  Yeah, I know.  That's disgusting.  You're sticky.  Cody?  Oh, yeah.  You got it all over.  Congratulations.  Hold on the line, all right?  All right, man.  All right.  Cody gets a MiFi as well from Buffalo.  Buffalo, we've got to say goodbye to Johnny in North Carolina.  Johnny, any final thoughts?  Yeah, he obviously got smoke in his eyes off his boots.  Yeah, smoke in his eyes off his boots.  All right.  Thank you, Johnny.  Thank you, ladies.

We learned a little something.  All right.  We have about a minute and a half left in the show, so we should get the plugs in.  Ladies, I want to thank the porn stars for coming by.  They were great.  Thank you for listening.  It was a pleasure.  They were awesome.  Candy and Star.  We're going to find you midgets.  Please do so.  Let's start with Star.  What Star?  Web Star?

You girls did a great job because we've got some girls in here and they're just combative.  Yeah.  We have to tie them up, knock them unconscious.  Why didn't I get tied up?  Oh, see that?  What the fuck?  He is a fun one.  I met my wife.  Do you want to touch Jimmy's mule as we end the show here?  She's got a stick.  Right now, it's awful.
