<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often shifting rapidly between serious discussions and crude humor.  The show opened with technical difficulties affecting Philadelphia callers, prompting comedic commentary on the city's perceived lack of significant news.  A major theme was Opie's "sports curse,"  with extensive analysis of his past cursed teams (Mets, Yankees, Red Sox, Bills) and his eventual decision to root for the Phillies due to his fiancée and a recent positive game experience. The Mets' collapse was dissected, fueled by listener calls and criticism of the team's management and players, particularly Tom Glavine.  This segment also included discussions of a crying Mets fan pictured in the New York Post, listener calls on various sports topics, and "Rocktober" radio promotions, leading to an internal "E-Rocktober" promotion for the perpetually late producer, E-Rock.  The hosts engaged in banter on women's clothing and a celebrity sighting of Jimmy Norton by a cab driver.  No in-studio guests were explicitly mentioned in this initial section.

The broadcast then transitioned to the "Make a Tie-In Monday" segment, featuring a Stephen Lynch song parody. Listener emails were addressed, including one about a radio station’s spelling errors and another detailing a horrifying child pornography case, prompting the hosts' furious condemnation and discussion of the death penalty.  Further emails covered a woman's death at an airport and reviews of the Van Halen reunion tour, followed by a Van Halen song parody. Opie recounted his weekend, including his uncle's one-year-old's birthday party, sparking a discussion about the absurdity of such parties and children in general.  A significant portion was devoted to a comedic bit involving oddly worded Hallmark cards, with listener calls contributing to the humorous critique.  The Van Halen tour and more listener calls concluded this segment.

The show continued with a word game based on words beginning with "C," which quickly shifted to a serious debate about the death penalty, examining various methods of execution and their ethical implications. This was followed by a discussion on school policies, specifically the banning of hugs and homemade baked goods, prompting personal anecdotes from the hosts. The hosts then extensively detailed their new, larger XM Satellite Radio studio, highlighting its features (multiple cameras, TVs, couches, bleachers) and lamenting various technical issues, particularly with their online audience (PalTalk).  A listener submitted an Iron Sheik pornographic audio mashup, which was played and discussed. Budget constraints for a Boston Halloween appearance were also aired, alongside an interaction with a member of the new studio audience.

A microphone malfunction kicked off the next segment, which inexplicably jumped to a discussion of Mesopotamia and Persia before introducing a studio guest taking Greek classes.  The conversation then involved several members of the studio audience, including individuals associated with the show's message boards (FBA). A Mets cap prompted further discussion of a recent Mets game. A significant portion was dedicated to the hosts' and guests' extremely vulgar and offensive critique of Paris Hilton’s David Letterman appearance, employing derogatory language.  Technical issues with the new studio, including camera reflections, were discussed alongside sexually suggestive jokes. A caller named Nick from Arkansas defended Paris Hilton, sparking a heated argument with the hosts, involving further insults and offensive language from both sides.  Other callers joined the debate, further intensifying the exchange.  The segment ended with the graphic description and playing of an audio clip of a fat woman having sex, punctuated by interactions with the studio audience and more technical difficulties.

The final segment heavily relied on listener calls, focusing on the definition of "sodomy" prompted by a news story about high school football players arrested for forcible sodomy during hazing.  The hosts and callers engaged in crude and sexually explicit speculation about the legal definition, extending the discussion to absurd and graphic scenarios, referencing Mr. Bill, E-Rock, John Denver, and other figures. A website video and listener-submitted "lines of the day" were also discussed, many with sexual undertones.  Technical difficulties, particularly with camera angles and the visibility of female camera operators, were also discussed. The show concluded with ribald humor and banter about the studio setup, Jim Norton’s appearance, and a host’s use of supplements.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screwed!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Intimists, DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  What happened to you?  I put a 380 in my chest and a full trigger.  Hey, how did help show up for you?  The question is, why did help show up for you?  This is where entertainment is going?  Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp.  They are sick. 
[00:01:00]  So you're kind of like a transvestite.  Or transsexual.  On your underwear, do you have a sign that says, pardon our appearance for remodeling?  This is the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I got to tell you, we got this amazing technical glitch, glitch, glitch, glitch. 
[00:01:30]  And I don't know if we're going to be able to fix it in the next three hours.  It's really strange.  What is it?  We can't take phone calls from Philadelphia today.  It's really, really strange.  Do you think they're lines?  Something happened?  Something happened.  We can't take a single phone call from Philadelphia this morning.  Huh.  Any other markets, though?  The rest of the network is perfectly fine. 
[00:02:00]  Wow.  Already people calling from Buffalo and Pittsburgh.  And look, a phone call from Syracuse there waiting to get on.  Boston, look, every morning Boston calls to say hi.  But Tim was telling me there's some weird glitch in the system.  And we cannot take a phone call from Philadelphia today.  Well, I certainly hope that gets fixed.  So I don't know.  I don't know what's going to happen.  Because, you know, Philadelphia is very, very important to the Opie and Anthony empire.  Yes.  But I guess we're going to have to go a day without hearing from Philadelphia. 
[00:02:30]  That's a shame.  It really is.  Not like there's anything going on in Philadelphia today.  No, I was going through the papers like we always do in the morning.  And I really didn't see, thank God, I didn't really see any Philly stories that were worth talking about.  But, you know, we're going to take a lot of calls from Buffalo because the Bills beat the Jets.  Yeah.  That's a nice little rivalry that happens every year.  Sure, sure.  We'll get into that a little bit. 
[00:03:00]  Boston, you know, they're hating us all the time.  So we'll take some phone calls from Boston.  That's commonplace.  Yeah.  Huh.  I mean, look for yourself, man.  We got New York on the line.  We got Cleveland on the line.  Washington on the line.  Even in West Palm Beach, Florida, Louisiana.  But Philadelphia, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry that you won't be able to talk to the show today.  Well, I would hope they would keep trying because maybe that glitch will clear itself up. 
[00:03:30]  And maybe they'll get through.  But I doubt it.  Is the dumb guy at his post?  Oh, boy.  Is the dumb guy at his post?  Let's say hi to, this should be safe, Nick in Louisiana.  Nick, what's going on?  Hey, Opie and Anthony.  How are you doing today?  Hey.  Hey, we're doing pretty good, Nick.  What do you got for the show?  Hey, I'm lucky enough to be from Philly, but I'm a truck driver in Louisiana. 
[00:04:00]  Don't.  And I just wanted to say, I guess they won't be serving hot dogs in Shea Stadium in October,  huh?  Well, I guess that didn't work.  That sounds good.  Oh, this is good.  Here's the dramatic moment where we played the last out of the Mets season, basically.  And it's not working.  Thank God we're professional broadcasters and we'll work our way around it somehow. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  Let me try this again here.  Who's responsible?  Off with his head.  Yeah.  Why would that happen?  Meet the Mets.  Greet the Mets.  Step right up and play golf with the Mets.  You're playing the wrong version again, E-Rocos. 
[00:05:00]  Ah.  Step right up and play golf with the Mets.  Yeah.  Oh, it's just an abomination.  Well, this should be safe.  That was terrible.  What happened to them?  Let's go to Ken in Delaware.  Ken, what's up?  How about them Phillies?  How about them?  Yeah, how about them?  You know, for the new listeners, I don't think they fully understand how bad my sports curse is. 
[00:05:30]  It's gotten to the point where people will call this radio show and beg me not to say anything about their favorite team.  It used to be funny.  Your sports curse.  It was genuinely a fun thing that we played around with because Obie would pick a team.  He'd back them.  And it wasn't like he's picking long shots or it was out of the realm of possibility of these teams winning.  You know, it was legitimate shots.  Just as good a shot.  It wasn't underdogs for the most part.  And when that team would lose because of some – I mean, it was amazing how these teams would lose. 
[00:06:00]  The Obie sports curse was born.  Any team that Obie backs will not win.  It just – it happens.  And it became very funny.  In time, we realized there was something more eerie and weird about it than funny.  And now it is just fact.  It's scary.  It's starting to creep me out. 
[00:06:30]  Because for, you know, a radio show, I picked a few losers.  Yeah.  And we're like, ah, you got a sports curse.  Like, yeah.  Anyway.  Sports curse.  Anyway, take off your clothes.  Take off your clothes, babe.  You know, we'd move on to something else.  But now it's gotten to the point.  It's just scary.  People are begging me not to even mention their team.  Don't mention –  Do you know, as far as the sports curse goes, do you know the only time I backed the Yankees was against the Red Sox?  Uh-huh.  That was the only time I ever openly said, go, Yankees, go. 
[00:07:00]  And we all know how that went.  Right.  A bigger meltdown than the Mets.  I would say, in baseball meltdown history, you got to go – I'm sorry, but Boston, you got to go at 86.  That had to be the biggest – that had to be the biggest meltdown ever.  Was that a real meltdown?  They were – whatever it was, I'm just talking about –  Keith Hernandez had a beer in his hand, a cigarette in his hand. 
[00:07:30]  Yes, there was a meltdown.  They were celebrating.  It was over, Johnny.  It was done.  The game was over.  I remember them running the credits, thanking everybody, Major League Baseball, broadcast of it.  It was done.  And they lost.  Yeah.  Then you got to give the Yankees, 2003, against the Sox.  That is huge.  That meltdown was huge because it was just the Yankees were supposed to win that.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down. 
[00:08:00]  Yes.  The Yankees is much more of a disaster than the 86 Red Sox.  No, no.  They were done.  They were done.  Dude, they won the World Series.  They won it.  The Red Sox were done.  I mean, no, they weren't done.  There were still games left.  It wasn't like you were at the end of the game and they had won the World Series.  The Red Sox, in 86, had pretty much technically won the World Series.  They were handing out the hats, the shirts, the champagne. 
[00:08:30]  The Mets were in the locker room.  They had undressed.  They were done.  The game was over.  There was still some baseball to be played.  It's just, those were costly meltdowns.  The Yankees and the Mets were costly meltdowns.  But I'm saying this one, you got to go with biggest meltdown.  Length of time is a meltdown.  Like, as far as that, this was a big one because of the length of time.  They blew, like, seven-game lead in 15 games.  Yeah.  I mean, that's a tremendous.  Okay, if you want to use semantics, then meltdown would be an overtime, 
[00:09:00]  a complete disastrous, like, occurrence.  I'm looking at just like an end-of-the-season collapse.  Okay.  Playoff things, man.  There's been a lot of-  Playoff collapse is definitely the Yankees.  That's history.  Worst ever.  Yeah, the Mets, they held a seven-game lead with 17 games left in the season.  Seven-game lead with 17 games left.  17 games left in the season.  Oh.  And they went 5-12 in those 17 games.  All they had to do was play 500 ball, and they would have- 
[00:09:30]  Come on, right?  Easily won the division.  By the way-  And they were in first place, like, the entire season.  Yeah.  They were-  They were pretty much the best team in baseball.  The best team in baseball.  They were right up there as one of the best teams in baseball the entire season.  By the way, just this guy remembers.  Maybe we can find the clip today.  Jeff in Staten Island.  The most infamous, Opie Jenks.  Yankees up 3-0 on the Red Sox.  And Opie said to Ben, who's a huge Red Sox fan,  Yeah.  Well, I guess your Red Sox are done. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And no, they weren't.  And as far as the sports curse goes, I believe it goes all the way back to my time doing radio in Buffalo.  I was there for all the Bills losses.  Oh, yeah.  And then it followed me.  I was up in Boston for the Pats loss in the Super Bowl.  It's just been kind of following me around.  Were you up there for the kick?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Scott Norwood?  Yes.  Norwood's kick.  Yes, I was on the radio for all those Super Bowl losses. 
[00:10:30]  Oh.  I was up there for all those losses.  It kind of started there.  I'm like, wow, this is kind of creepy.  And then it kind of followed me around.  It certainly does.  I can't tell you the last time I picked a winner.  I can't tell you.  Damn.  Can't tell you.  Back to Eagles in the Super Bowl a couple years back.  A few years back, whatever it was at this point.  Well, I'm sure the cities that have teams that are in the playoffs are just wondering 
[00:11:00]  who you're going to back.  Who is it going to be?  It could be the Phillies this year because I got to tell you something.  Now, Opie's engaged.  His girl from Philly.  Opie, now Philly is his second home pretty much.  The Mets are out of it.  You and I went to a Phillies game and we were treated very nicely.  Yeah, we were treated nicely.  It's great.  I know you're not a Yankees fan at all, so any endorsement of them wouldn't be heartfelt. 
[00:11:30]  But I do believe, Opie, I'm not saying it, but we'll see how things pan out.  But I would bet that Opie chooses the Phillies as his team this year.  We had a tour of the new stadium down there.  Met some of the players.  Met a few players?  Met a few players.  I even said to one of the people that was hanging out with us that I could get used to going to the Phillies games.  Yep.  I didn't say I'm a fan, but I said just get used to this. 
[00:12:00]  I'm used to going down to the park.  It's a great park.  They've got a fine presentation down there.  Oh, amazing.  So what do you think?  Go Phillies!  Oh, no!  Go Phillies!  Oh, there it is!  There it is!  Pull the tape!  This is what I do.  Pull the tape!  Because I was reading the message boards.  Everyone's like, make sure you start calling right at six and give them bunk.  Oh, my God.  Well, that's what I do in return.  Go Phillies!  You aren't saying go Phillies. 
[00:12:30]  Is this an official endorsement?  You are picking the Phillies.  I think it's their year.  To take it all the way.  I think it's their year.  They had a hell of a year.  The curse gods are now...  All right.  You heard it, guys.  Get to work.  Go Phillies!  Get to work.  You, I want to put you on errors.  Go Phillies!  They're dealing out responsibility to the cursed spirits.  All right.  You, go ahead.  You're in charge of injuries.  Yeah.  All right.  Really F them up.  I'm going Phillies, and I said it, if my Mets are knocked out, then I have to go Sox for 
[00:13:00]  our time in Boston.  I kind of got into the Boston teams a little bit.  Wow.  As kind of like a second or third tier type of thing.  All right.  I say go Phillies, and I say go Sox.  Go Sox, go!  And the thing is, now I know this, too, with the sports curse, you can't, this is kind of  out of your control a little bit, because you can't just say a team and then have it  work that way.  No, I don't get it.  It's got to be sincere. 
[00:13:30]  You really have to mean that you want these teams to win.  I don't just throw teams, you know, pull teams out of a hat.  Yeah.  You know, for all the reasons you said, I got a pretty big connection, obviously, in  Philly.  Sure.  We were just at the park having a really, really good time.  Great time.  And I was sitting there going, I could get used to going to a few games.  All right.  I was kind of feeling a little bit.  Then I'm like, but that's kind of crazy.  You're a Mets fan.  But now the Mets are out of it.  It would be kind of nice to see the Phillies win.  You're going to be going to a couple of playoff games, maybe?  Actually, we got the invite in my email right there. 
[00:14:00]  Really?  Yeah.  All right.  You guys want to take a trip to Philadelphia?  Go Phillies.  See some Phillies ball or what?  Oh, I would love to with you.  See, these asses thought they were going to get me.  Hey, what?  Make sure you call up right away.  Oh.  Well, that's what I do.  I use the sports curse.  No, I really believe the Phillies are going to win it all, though.  I really do.  Okay.  That's fine.  And what a great way to end the sports curse if the Phillies go all the way now.  Yeah.  It would be the end of the sports curse that has been active for over a dozen years. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  And I got to go with the Sox in the American League.  I can't go with the Yankees.  I just can't do that.  No, no.  You can't, obviously.  That's sacrilege.  Yeah.  I understand.  And there you have it.  How did the Mets not get the wild card?  Was the division, was the wild card ahead of second place in the East?  Yeah, it was a weird situation because I thought that, too.  It's like, wow, they don't make first place.  You get a wild card. 
[00:15:00]  Well, who got the wild card, then?  Yeah, they're...  They don't know.  What?  What is there, a playoff?  There's still a playoff for the wild card position.  There's a playoff against who?  Don't worry.  The Mets aren't in it.  Before you say it, if the Mets had won yesterday, would they have stayed in it?  Yeah, they would have been in it in some form.  I think they would have had.  If the Mets had won, too, then they would have had to have a playoff game.  Okay, but they would have...  Okay.  Yeah.  But it's the Rockies and Padres play tonight for the wild card.  Can you please root for the Padres? 
[00:15:30]  See, and this is Eric from Colorado.  No, I think they would have had to lose.  I think Philly would have had to lose, and the Mets would have had to win in order for  there to be in a playoff, because I think there was still a half game out.  Wow.  Even if they...  But they were both tied for the NL East, so if they both won or they both lost, they  would still be tied, so they'd have to play each other.  But the Phillies did win.  Yeah, the Phillies won.  And the Mets lost.  Okay, and the Mets lost.  All right, let's say I had Eric in Colorado.  He's in...  Any way you put it, the Mets are out of it.  That, meet the Mets, greet the Mets, step right up and play golf with the Mets. 
[00:16:00]  I want to hug you.  That's so funny.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Let's go to Eric.  What's up, Eric?  I didn't even ride you.  Hey, morning, boys.  I know.  Hey, I hope I'd like you to sincerely root for the Padres.  You know, I know how much you love San Diego, and I'd really like to encourage you to root  for them.  You know, this way we could have maybe a Rockies and Phillies playoff later on. 
[00:16:30]  See, I'm not even going to mention a team there, because I've got to feel it.  Yeah, he's just feeling the Phillies, man.  I could give a crap about either one of those teams, so...  Well, you know, but Anthony has a connection here to Colorado, so I'm sure Anthony would  like Colorado to win.  Not at all.  SportsCritic can reverse.  Dude, the people in Colorado don't have an attachment to the Rockies.  A lot of them are New Yorkers, Yankee fans.  I'll tell you what, today's game sold out last night before... 
[00:17:00]  I'm saying they can't fill a ballpark.  Jesus.  Right.  Wait, what are you going to tell us?  Listen to this.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry?  What were you saying?  The Rockies game for today against San Diego was sold out last night.  The tickets went on sale as soon as the game came yesterday, and it's sold out already.  And you're supposed to be surprised at that.  Well...  It wasn't like it was tickets for Kadra Gugu's, you know, coming out of retirement tour. 
[00:17:30]  You'll see that.  Me too.  You make it sound like, oh boy, you know, this is a one-game playoff.  We've got to get a bunch of commercials on TV so we can sell some tickets for this thing.  I hope this thing sells out.  How many tickets we sell today?  Right.  It's a one-game playoff.  Of course it sold out.  Within an hour.  If it didn't sell out within an hour, I'd be surprised.  A casual fan would want to go to that.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm not a fan of either team, and I would go to that.  That would be something like, wow, this has got to be exciting.  Yeah.  Douche. 
[00:18:00]  All right, enough.  I don't even...  I don't carry the way, so have fun out there.  Yeah.  I care about the Phillies.  I care about the Sox.  And how about them Cubbies?  How about them?  Oh, God, no.  Oh, is he just throwing out the bad mojo?  How about those Cubbies?  How about them?  Hey, here's some quotes from the Mets.  Carlos Delgado.  It's even better than that. 
[00:18:30]  Actually, the front page of the New York Post.  That's fantastic.  Got to respect the New York Post today.  Crying shame.  Crushing loss.  End season for the Mets.  And they got a...  It's actual size.  What?  That picture is an actual size picture of a little kid's head.  How old do you think this kid is?  That poor kid's about eight.  Nine?  Yeah.  Let's say he's about eight.  He's got his little Met hat on that he's so proud of.  And he's in the middle of a really good cry.  He is crying.  He's running down his face, and it's on the front page of the New York Post today. 
[00:19:00]  Both cheeks are wet, and by where his little jowls would be, he's got two perfect tears  just ready to drip off onto his shirt.  Oh, you know...  And his mouth has the...  Look.  You know they took about 100 pictures of this kid, and they're like, this is the one right  here.  It's perfect.  How embarrassing for that kid when he gets a little older, and his mommy brings that  out when he brings his little girlfriend over.  And here's when he was in the newspaper. 
[00:19:30]  Just crying.  Mom, put that away.  I'll kill you.  And then the Daily News, from champs to chumps.  Oh.  They're having fun with the headlines today in New York.  Anyway, Carlos Delgado, one of the Mets players, obviously.  We got so much talent, I think sometimes we get bored.  What?  Pedro Martinez, quote, is saying, we have so much talent that sometimes we relax a little  bit.  What did Tom Glavin say?  Oh, you read this one?  No.  But what did he say?  Sometimes when you're a team as talented as we are, I don't know if I'd use the word 
[00:20:00]  bored, but I guess you could get complacent at times.  Now, this had to be before the game.  No, this is...  These are post-game?  Oh, this is...  Oh, these are just quotes from...  During the season.  During the season.  Yeah.  I wouldn't say that.  It's probably not a smart thing to go, ah, we were bored.  Glavin's ERA yesterday was 189.  189?  Dude, he...  If he pitched nine innings, he would have gave up 189 runs.  Yes.  Way to come to the...  He was supposed to be the savior. 
[00:20:30]  And he'd done great all season.  I mean, he'd really had a good season.  And they put him in there, a key game.  You mean he pulled an A-Rod?  Uh, yeah.  Choked.  Yeah.  They can't fire Willie Randolph either.  That's not his fault, man.  They certainly can.  They shouldn't.  Let's say hi to Stephanie.  Because it's a couple of bad weeks and it's not his fault.  Joe Torre gets away with that because, you know, he got a few rings.  You can't get a guy like that.  Someone's head has to roll and it's usually someone at the time. 
[00:21:00]  I would not fire Willie Randolph.  Ah, he's so gone.  I don't think he should be.  He's so gone.  You look at the, like...  Seven game lead with 17 games left and, you know, he is so gone by the end of the week.  Who do you blame?  Who are you blaming for that?  I blame the players, man.  I really do.  It's like, because the players...  Well, the players...  Well, you can't fire the players.  You can't blame the players.  Also, the skipper is supposed to be the guy that goes in there and makes the players win.  You're right.  He's supposed to look at what's going wrong. 
[00:21:30]  And he had a lot of opportunity to see what was going wrong there, Mikey.  A lot of opportunity.  He's supposed to see what's wrong and get their team up to snuff so they can win the game.  This is a big game.  It was a clinch game there, Mikey.  He's so gone, Jimmy.  I will bet $100 right now.  Willie Randolph is done.  You can't blame the guy.  That I know.  Because Tom Glavin...  Sports curse I can't figure out, but I can figure this stuff out.  When Tom Glavin has given up seven runs in the first inning, that's like beyond a manager's 
[00:22:00]  control.  No, Jimmy, it's not.  Hold on, hold on.  I'll tell you why he's fired.  I'll say it again.  It's not because they didn't win the big game yesterday.  It's because of the collapse.  No, I know.  I'm just...  You can't lose a seven and a half game lead with 17 games left and expect to keep your  job as a coach.  I'm telling you.  That wasn't one game.  You're right.  It wasn't one game.  It's one game I'm with Jimmy.  You know, star freaking pitchers.  Everyone has that off night, no matter what.  Not only that, but Glavin's in there giving up runs like that.  It's not some middle of the season game that you go, oh, well, we'll leave him in there 
[00:22:30]  and stuff.  Have a little more foresight.  And I know it's detrimental to the pitcher's psyche, but get him the hell out of there before  he can give up so many runs, even though it is very early in the game.  The guy sat there while he gave up seven runs?  Jesus Christ.  Let's say hi to Stephanie in Philadelphia.  Stephanie, what's up?  O-B-Y.  O-Y.  Hey, I guess you call him from Philly. 
[00:23:00]  We have waited 14 years.  You're killing us.  See, the people that have been with this show for a while, they fully understand this sports  curse.  It's creepy.  I'm telling you.  It's very creepy at this point.  I couldn't tell you the last time I picked a winner.  And like I said, I don't go for long shots for the most part.  I like an underdog every once in a while.  But these have been very safe, safe picks over the years.  And I cannot pick a winner.  Yeah.  Stephanie, don't worry.  This might be the year that Opie's sport curse goes away. 
[00:23:30]  And Ant knows I mean business because I was even looking at some of the Phillies merchandise  a little bit.  I'm like, maybe I'll buy a Phillies hat when I'm hanging out in Philly.  You know, I could throw a Phillies hat on him.  When we were there, we had such a great time.  The team's fantastic.  Right behind the dugout.  I know.  So why would you crap on us?  He's not crapping.  He's just, that's what happens.  Now he's starting to root for a team.  And it's the Phillies.  What are you going to do?  You know, it's fun to go Phillies and have everyone in Philly go, oh, no. 
[00:24:00]  But I'm serious.  I'm kind of feeling the Phillies.  No, you take it, just take it back.  I'd beg you to take it back.  All right, Stephanie.  I'm sorry.  Go Phillies, though, man.  It's going to be fun.  It's going to be some fun playoffs now.  We've got to take our first break.  So there you go.  That's the big story in baseball, of course, and in New York City.  Yankees didn't do much better, though, man.  No, I know.  You know, they backdoored it in there. 
[00:24:30]  I understand.  We'll see what happens.  And in all, the slate gets wiped clean during the playoffs, my friend.  What were they saying?  This first time the Yankees didn't win the division in nine years or something like that?  Yeah, it's been a while.  Ten years?  Nine?  Nine years?  That's pretty impressive, man.  Huh?  I think they didn't want to play the Angels.  Like, if they won the division, wouldn't they have to play the Angels?  I don't know.  Who they can't beat ever.  They never.  If the Angels died in a plane crash, the Yankees would still lose four to one.  Yeah.  Because they would suit up their front office or something.  I know. 
[00:25:00]  They'd send Rod Carew out there at 60.  Right.  Was that an accurate joke right there, Rod Carew?  Is he...  The next California Angel?  Yes, he is.  But I don't know.  But I mean, is he with the team still?  Oh, I don't know.  Okay.  I was wondering if he's like kind of a hitting coach or something for them.  That would be hilarious.  I think I should have picked Brian Downing, who was their stupid catcher with his glasses  like John Denver, but with bigger calves.  All right.  Our phone number, 877-212-ON-A.  Today is Feel Good Story Monday. 
[00:25:30]  Feel Good Story Monday.  It's also Pot Talk Monday, and it's also Ringtone Monday Mania.  Wait a minute.  Who threw the mania in?  We went with mania a while ago.  A while ago?  I think we forgot to use it a couple of times.  Who wants to...  I like mania.  Anybody want to do a ringtone yet?  For the fans?  You got one, Jimmy?  I don't yet.  No, but I will.  All right.  Jimmy's going to give a few free ringtones today.  Ringtones.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:26:00]  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  What's wrong?  That went well.  Tom wanted to bet, what, $100 on the Willie Randolph thing?  He agreed with my point that they won't fire Willie.  He doesn't think they're going to fire him?  We'll have to wait and see.  I have an affection for Willie because I like him so much when he's a Yankee. 
[00:26:30]  I kind of want to see him succeed as a coach, so I hope they don't dump him.  Phone number 877-212-ONDA.  We finally got this fixed, so for Philly, here you go.  1-2 to Castillo.  Off the plate, it's 2-2.  This is a franchise that is going to have to regroup in 2008.  They certainly expected to play October baseball in 2007,  and it certainly appears that that will not happen.  Swing and a miss.  He struck him out. 
[00:27:00]  Barring a huge Washington rally in Philadelphia in the ninth inning.  The greatest late September collapse in the history of Major League Baseball  is now complete.  They're calling it the greatest collapse?  Yeah, maybe.  In September? 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  That's why I was saying that was such a massive one.  It was just such a short period of time.  They were really, it was just, every Mets fan was convinced they were in.  It was a given because they were seven games up, you know, a month left.  They were in.  Yeah.  The disappointment.  That's why they're so disappointed.  It's not like they were playing like crab and, ah, well.  And they were showing grown men crying at Shea. 
[00:28:00]  The clips they show of the stands are better than the game.  Well, the cameramen have to be Yankee fans.  They have to be.  They were just showing people sitting there.  There was one thing I saw.  Some guy sitting with some pretty attractive girl,  and she's just yapping in his ear.  And this guy was just staring straight ahead,  and it looked like he just was ready to punch her in the face.  Because she wouldn't shut up.  He's just, he wants to just bathe in his depression for a while. 
[00:28:30]  And she's probably just yapping about something.  Shoes.  I don't know what she's yapping about.  You know what?  Willie Randolph's job, and I got to say, it was to right the ship.  Like, you got to kind of, when guys,  what happens is they're all good players,  so that's like an emotional and mental collapse.  Like, they're panicking.  Right.  They're panicking, and the manager is kind of supposed to go,  whoa, whoa, whoa, and sit everybody down and go, just relax.  Yeah, you got to have the guy in charge, 
[00:29:00]  has to be the guy that gets in there, talks to the team,  does what he's got to do as the skipper to pull them all back together.  Get them all back with their feet on the ground  and get out there and win some games there, Mikey.  But he couldn't do it.  He couldn't do it.  Yes, the lunatic is on the grass.  Jack from Jersey, keeping the Pink Floyd bit going.  There it goes.  And then he writes, and he's making werewolf movies.  Movies.  Movies. 
[00:29:30]  Steven S. from Bayshore,  are the Mets collapsed worse than Tom's little lungs?  Linger Lunger.  And also Gabriel from Hopewell,  hey, Ope, don't beat yourself up.  At least the Giants beat the Eagles.  I was rooting for the Eagles this weekend.  I'm not a Giants fan.  Oh, my God.  Everyone knows I'm not a Giants fan.  Jeff in Staten Island, and I was rooting for the Eagles.  F all that sports.  Did you see Jill Nicolini's tees in that red dress she's wearing today on Jill TV? 
[00:30:00]  She was kind of wearing the droopy dress today, though.  Was it droopy?  Eh, some women that there's one dress that women shouldn't,  they just shouldn't wear in general.  Huh.  It's the one that kind of ties behind their neck.  It all depends on what's happening in the front.  The tie behind the neck one.  She's got, you know, she's got something going on.  No, no, I mean dress-wise.  If it ties around the neck and does something weird up front,  you know, then it could look a little silly.  I call it the droopy dress.  Droopy dress?  I see it at weddings a lot where people, like, there's probably... 
[00:30:30]  Grandmas?  No, I mean, it's young women.  There's probably 1% of the females out there that could actually pull off the droopy dress.  But most women don't realize that.  They wear the droopy dress, and no matter...  Even if they have the most amazing you-know-whats,  they kind of still, you know, hang a bit.  Because it's called the droopy dress.  It's just how it's designed.  Yeah.  It makes them look long.  A little long in the front. 
[00:31:00]  Even if they're up.  Yeah.  Just how the dress is designed, it just makes them look long.  Long.  I call it the droopy dress.  And Jill's got a droopy dress on today.  So I'm not in agreement with that instant feedbacker there.  You talk about weddings.  Some of the older ladies that show up at the weddings,  they shouldn't wear those big swooping backless things.  You ever notice?  You ever see that?  Yeah.  It's just things going on.  It's just...  You can't take your eyes off of it. 
[00:31:30]  Well, it's...  It's like a topographical map.  I was going to say, it highlights all this sun damage.  There's all kinds of...  Yeah, sun damage.  And, like...  You know, we all have a...  Things.  We all have a freckle or two.  Yeah, yeah.  Things going on here and there.  Maybe a mole or two.  That's all right.  But, man, you get some of these older ladies,  and you're like, wow, that sun could do some serious damage.  Yeah.  You don't even know what half the stuff is on the back.  Oh, I don't know.  You really don't.  It's this color.  Don't wear that backless thing.  Whenever I see a big bear, like a big bear back in the back, I just want to throw hot 
[00:32:00]  coffee on it.  I just...  I don't care how sweet the back looks, it's just made for a piping hot cup of coffee.  Piping.  Here she comes.  A big red blotch on her back.  She's going to splash cold water on her back.  Let's say hi to Mike in Paramus.  Mike, what's up?  Oh, you guys, I need to correct you.  It's not the New York Mets. 
[00:32:30]  It's the New York Mess.  The New York Mess.  There you go.  Let's say hi to Nick.  He's listening on the edge of Buffalo.  What's up, Nick?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Love you guys up here.  Hey, I just wanted to congratulate the Bills on the big up-dum on the win over the Jets.  Yeah, I was going for the Jets this weekend as well, and that's the God's honest truth.  Oh.  Hey, he, he, I suck, suck, suck.  All right, let's go to Juan.  Yeah, there's a team just having its problems, man. 
[00:33:00]  Oof.  Let's go to Juan in Chicago.  Juan.  Hello, Juan.  Good morning, guys.  Hey.  Hello?  Hello?  Go ahead, Juan.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Yeah, we went through that already.  What's up, Juan?  Okay, sorry.  Opie, why do you have to say go Cubbies?  I don't know.  I think, uh, I'd like to see the Cubbies.  It's, uh...  But see, I'm going Phillies all the way, though.  Yeah, Phillies all the way.  I'm going Phillies all the way, and I'm going Red Sox all the way in the American League. 
[00:33:30]  Hold on.  Whoa, whoa, what happened?  Is this the news?  Hold on, hold on, Juan.  The weather woman...  That's Jill.  Yeah, the weather woman...  With her droopy dress.  Jill...  Oh, no, that's Linda Tripp.  Yeah, it's Linda Tripp.  I think it was Jill, Linda Church.  Linda Tripp.  She kind of looks like her.  She came out...  Was that Jill that came out?  Yeah.  For Oktoberfest.  With a foamy head of beer glass, and a keg on her head. 
[00:34:00]  She had a keg on her head?  It was a big keg mask.  She could have had that on for the last six months, and where we look, we never would have noticed.  There's been a keg on your head?  There's been a keg on her head.  And she was dancing around.  And it's supposed to be the news.  Well, oh.  Yeah.  Gotta wish everyone a very happy Rocktober.  Wait a minute, is it Rocktober already?  It's Rocktober first, everyone.  Wow.  What happened to Zeptember? 
[00:34:30]  Jesus, Zeptember just blew by.  Zeptember never, you know, took off.  No.  But Rocktober's a staple.  Rocktober.  What stations are doing Rocktober?  I worked at four different radio stations that did Rocktober.  Whoa.  Rocktober.  And the DJs.  It's Rocktober first, everyone.  Now make sure we push this Rocktober thing, guys.  Let's keep track of all the radio stations that are doing Rocktober from your fine city.  Rocktober.  Which station in New York does Rocktober? 
[00:35:00]  I would guess the queue.  You would have to guess Q104?  I would think the classic Rock station.  Yeah.  It's the only one that would do Rocktober in keeping with the classic thing.  And then they have all sorts of specials for Rocktober.  Of course.  What's a Rocktober special?  I don't remember anymore.  Because it's like...  Did you hear it at the end of September?  Yeah.  I think instead of two for Tuesday, they do three for Tuesday. 
[00:35:30]  I don't even know what it is.  Like, it doesn't have a theme like Zep-Tember.  You'd play a lot of Zeppelin.  They just try to give you a little extra rock.  Oh, a little more rock?  In general, they just give you a little more rock.  Hey, that one's great for Rocktober.  Oh, is it?  A little more rock.  Yeah, a little fog hat.  A little extra fog hat.  By the way, I don't know what's going on with my brother.  His football picks this year suck.  He's doing my picks this year, thanks to Dish Network.  And I'm in almost last place. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, boy.  Travis is leading with 17 total wins this year.  I have 11.  The only one that I'm beating is Sam, who has eight wins.  Sam.  What?  He got zero for the week.  Oh, Sam went 0 for 7?  Wow, that's hard to do.  Sam went 0 for 7?  That is really hard to do.  That is hard to do.  How do you go 0 for 7?  And we're not even doing, like, a point spread.  Sam, how do you go 0 for 7 in the football pick? 
[00:36:30]  What are you, on the Mets?  I tried using my instincts this time.  Ah, they worked well for you.  Yeah, I thought that I'd won at least a few.  So you went Jets, you went Eagles.  I don't even have any recollection of this.  Do you even know?  I don't really have any recollection.  No, I don't remember.  Do you know anything about football?  No.  Obviously.  I had no idea.  So just pick home teams.  I just looked.  I didn't even know where the games were taking place.  It's usually the second team in the listing of the two teams playing. 
[00:37:00]  See, that's something I didn't know.  Look for capital letters.  Oh, my God.  Look for the name after at.  Yeah, just root for.  You know, I'm making fun of him.  He's barely, I'm barely beating him.  My brother sucks this year.  He was the big star of the football picks last year.  He sucks this year.  I have a guy who may be very good for you.  Who?  He's a buddy of mine.  He's a comedian.  And he's the statistician for the New York Giants.  And he knows a lot about football. 
[00:37:30]  Why wouldn't you suggest that to somebody else?  Perhaps one of the staff.  Because when it's the Sam and Anthony show, or the Travis and Anthony show, I'll be happy  to.  But as of right now, my friend Ope happens to be at the helm, so I suggest the knowledgeable  football guy to my friend Ope.  Okay.  And there you, so you did.  Sam can plummet to his death for all I care.  I'm going to give disrespect, Sam.  I'm going to give my brother one more chance. 
[00:38:00]  And then, before I switch him out, you're fired.  And he was doing MP3 files and stuff, too.  So maybe he'll do a whole audio presentation this week.  On his firing?  On why he's picking the games he is.  Yeah, he really needs to have an excuse.  I want to make sure he's taking it very seriously.  So he'll do some audio files, and then we'll make a decision.  But man, so who was the big winner this week?  Travis again?  Sex Bagel.  Sex Bagel?  Eric?  Sex Bagel. 
[00:38:30]  Yes.  E-Rock went five for seven this week, but you're in the middle of the pack.  But you win what?  A couple hundred dollars?  Uh, $250, I think.  $250, very good.  The football pick sponsored by Dish Network.  It's time to get more TV from your TV.  Sign up for Dish Network today.  All right.  Hey, um.  E-Rock tries to eat out of them.  You know.  The dish.  That deserves a couple.  I'm a cowboy fan.  I'm a bad cowboy fan.  I haven't been watching.  Really?  Congratulations to the boys.  Having a great start.  Good for the Cowboys. 
[00:39:00]  Good for the Cowboys.  America's team.  America's team.  I like when a team tries to pull that gag to get people from out of town to watch and  be interested.  Yeah.  Like the Braves pulled that with the superstation there, TBS.  They tried to pull that.  America's team.  Because you can watch them everywhere.  No one cared.  Nah.  No one.  No one gave a crap.  By the way.  I'm a hawk chop.  By the way, Chris from Buffalo.  97 Rock.  Rocktober first for 97 Rock. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  There it is.  Oh, look at that.  And it's sponsored by, guess what?  Uh, roll.  Well.  Screw them.  A beer.  A beer.  A beer.  Rolling.  Which is what you do with your car after you drink a few.  Uh, here we go.  They're coming in now.  Thank you.  Uh, gut shot Drew from Howell.  Uh, 106.3 G-Rock in New Jersey.  The morning show signed on at 5.30 this morning with a hearty, happy Rocktober first, everybody. 
[00:40:00]  They probably had meetings and memos about this.  Now, remember, we pushed this Rocktober thing all through October.  Keep reminding people.  Uh, Bob and Tom in Syracuse are doing Proctober, so, uh.  Proctober?  They're a bit older.  Ow.  Uh, J.R.R. in Orlando said Rocktober four times in 20 minutes.  There you go.  The Rocktober stations.  Mm-hmm.  Very excited that October is here. 
[00:40:30]  Why would they say Rocktober?  We know what month it is.  We know what music you play.  It's silly.  It's a month where you can celebrate the fact that you rock.  You rock.  And it's October.  It sounds like October, except, uh, with rock.  Why not just say, uh, Rockuary?  Yes.  February.  Why not?  Just do it with all the months then.  It doesn't rhyme as well.  Rock lie.  Rock och.  And some stations did try to get Zeptember together.  It just, uh, failed miserably. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  Zeptember.  Uh, Stephen S. writes, Radio Berlin is celebrating Reichtober.  Reichtober.  Reichtober.  Reichtober.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Hey, did we do this already?  We did that.  Okay, good.  All right.  Phone number 877-212-ONA.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's Opie.  It's Anthony.  It's Jim Norton.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Instant feedback is, uh, hot and heavy today, that's for sure. 
[00:41:30]  Stephen S. is just writing like crazy today.  Stephen S. from Bayshore, he writes, Steve C. will be celebrating Twinktoberfest by hiring  a new batch of Voyage interns.  He writes, yes, indeed.  Scroll, scroll, scroll.  It is October 1st.  They're scrolling on his BlackBerry or whatever it is.  It's October 1st.  A lot of radio stations kicking into Rocktober. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  I'm in, uh, Alimony-tober, I call it.  Oh, really?  Oh, I love the 1st of October.  It's just a wonderful time for me.  Do you feel good about paying that out?  Uh, I didn't say that.  Oh, I love it.  Cool.  It's so much fun.  He loves the fact that they're, uh, getting less and less.  Yeah, that's all I could really, like, that's the only consolation I have is each one I write  is one less. 
[00:42:30]  How many to go?  Um.  Are you allowed to say?  I, I, I don't know.  Let me think.  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  Aren't you less than a year at this point?  Probably about that.  About a year to go?  I'm not sure.  We are going to throw the biggest party for Anthony.  That's going to be a biggie.  Anthony's going to get a huge raise next year.  That's going to be a biggie.  You're not going to know what to do with yourself.  Oh, is that, oh.  Have you calculated the...  Nope, I haven't even.  You are going to get a huge, huge raise. 
[00:43:00]  It'll be over.  Maybe we should all, like, have a party and send a big card.  We could all sign it.  That'd be hilarious.  Got to get a card that's as big as a house.  Yeah.  One of those giant cards you get to somebody.  That's huge.  Yeah, when they're sick or out of work or something like that.  All right.  Hey, Scott M. from Hoppog.  Open Anthony present E-Rocktober.  Oh, E-Rocktober.  Let's just go home.  We might have to start E-Rocktober. 
[00:43:30]  Nothing.  And then he continues.  Poor E-Rock.  According to Scott from Hoppog, E-Rocktober featuring more E-Rock hoopla than any other  station in America.  I started.  I kicked off E-Rocktober today.  You did?  I was 20 minutes late to work.  There you go.  All right.  I started E-Rocktober.  We got the how late was E-Rock sweeper today?  Oh.  Eric forgot to put that one out, I guess.  Oh, well, he didn't get here on time and didn't put it in. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, okay.  He was too late to put in the E-Rock slate sweeper.  Well, according to Scott from Hoppog, you got E-Rocktober featuring more E-Rock hoopla  than any other station in America.  Are you a fan of mayo being picked on by coworkers and sleeping in late?  Then you'll love E-Rocktober.  E-Rocktober.  We have to have an E-Rocktober sweeper now.  Other people here saying during E-Rocktober, you're all allowed to gain 30 pounds.  Yeah. 
[00:44:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony E-Rock clock watch.  Is E-Rock late again?  Maybe his battery died.  Our year traffic was awful.  What time did E-Rock get in today?  Ah, not too bad today.  14 minutes late.  14 minutes.  That's not too bad.  That's all right.  I love that.  Maybe his alarm clock didn't go off. 
[00:45:00]  That voice is hilarious.  He was 14 minutes late today?  Yeah.  That's about average.  Yes.  What?  It gets worse than that, usually.  Where are you living these days?  Are you living in Cleveland?  Are you commuting from Cleveland?  You don't have to say exactly.  Just like where?  Is it Manhattan or Queens or...  Jersey.  I used this.  The C came out.  I'm sorry.  I did the F word.  Yeah.  And I always say, once you hit the C, there's really no return. 
[00:45:30]  So they might have dumped out of that.  Oh, all right.  Well, you missed the fact that he said he lives in Jersey.  Oh, you live in Jersey.  Yeah.  Is it like far for you to get from where you live in Jersey to the tunnel or the bridge  or whatever you take?  Not too far, no.  No?  So it's pretty much an easy drive in.  Okay.  Just checking.  Why won't you come in on time, E-Rock?  I don't know. 
[00:46:00]  How late were you today?  You know that any other job would have fired you for being late as much as you've been late?  And I've actually talked to you about it, and now you just make me look silly.  I don't care personally because I used to be late to my regular job when I worked for  a living every day, and I couldn't understand why my boss would get mad at me because I  would go, hey, as long as the job gets done, go screw.  This isn't working for a living.  I know.  You should want to be here, like, early.  Ah.  Do you know how many people listening right now would love to be in our position? 
[00:46:30]  I woke up late, and I looked down at my speedometer as I was driving at one point.  I was doing 94 miles an hour in an escalator, which is just a rolling boulder.  It's like the Indiana Jones boulder.  Why did you not go that fast?  Because I had to come in, see?  I noticed I was late, and I wanted to get in.  Why don't you just be late as opposed to doing 94 miles an hour?  Why did you not do that?  See, I'm looking at it differently.  You hit 94, you've got to tap out at 100. 
[00:47:00]  You're that close.  I looked down and saw 94.  There were some times I believe I was going fast, and that's the only thing I looked at.  All right.  I'm proud of you.  You can make up a lot of room by Shea Stadium, by that turn over there, by hitting the right  lane, by the way, if you're listening.  Yeah.  Right lane, not the left.  Everyone clears out of that right lane.  Well, there won't be any game traffic.  Well, not to worry about that.  Everybody. 
[00:47:30]  I can't admit soccer.  Crying kids.  Playing golf.  I know.  Golf jokes all day for me.  Wow.  That's a new streak.  Oh.  Oh.  I was feeling good about the Mets this year, too.  John from Philly.  Rocktober is worthy of Jimmy's phenomenal song.  You got it there, E-Rock? 
[00:48:00]  We haven't played this in a while.  And then he does write Linger Lunger.  Here's for John and others.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Do you ever look back, and again, I know I do, when you look back on something you feel  great about, and then you look back on it and you go, oh, what the f*** was I thinking? 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, I'm still doing that.  I'm still doing that.  I'm still doing that.  It's Sabbath stuff.  There's one song, uh, um, Who Are You?  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  And you know, there's always got to be one buzzkill in life, and I've got to just really  quick address the post.  A guy named Dan Acvalante.  I want to strike him out in his face.  He gave me trash on our Sabbath, where Ozzy created horror with his cringe-inducing vocals. 
[00:49:00]  Ozzy sounded phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Classic.  It's a classic, but, uh, what does that have to do with Rocktober, Joe?  I don't know.  Nothing.  I have no idea.  You could have just requested that, and we'll play it.  Nothing.  Don't need to break or something.  It was, I, as it was playing, I had no idea why it was playing, but I do enjoy that one.  I'm going to read his instant feedback again.  Read the instant feedback. 
[00:49:30]  Back from Philly, Rocktober is worthy of Jimmy's Phenomenal song.  Maybe because it's music.  It's a song, I guess.  I don't know.  He's talking about Sabbath in there.  I didn't, by the way, I didn't, uh, make that song.  I don't want anyone to credit me.  It was by, it was Henchman.  Yes.  I remember that one.  Yes.  Can I, uh, can I shout out very quickly to a cabbie who I took me this morning?  Giving a shout out?  I never do.  All right, Holmes.  But I get, no, where does Bond, I get in my, uh, I get into my, uh, what did you just  say?  I don't know.  What did I say?  Oh my God. 
[00:50:00]  Um, I'm very, very urban.  Yes.  Um, I was, I got into a cab this morning, so the cabbie looks in the mirror and he, I  see, he said, he's a foreign gentleman.  Yes.  And he goes, uh, are you a model?  I'm like, what?  And he goes, I see a picture on a truck.  I'm like, no, you didn't.  What?  I'm not a model.  And then he goes, uh, like a minute later, he goes, Jimmy Norton.  And he recognized me from the show.  Oh.  He's a show fan, but he knew my face.  From a model?  I think talking for a second. 
[00:50:30]  To a show.  He heard the voice.  Like, he knew he knew me, but he just didn't know from where.  Yeah.  And then he starts talking about how Anthony's got problems.  Yeah, of course he does.  Agreed with him.  What kind of problems?  Just about his driving and his complaining about the driving.  He probably, because I bash cab drivers constantly.  No, he wasn't trashing you.  He was just saying that your drive, uh, he was just like, why is he, he was saying about  your, complaining about your drive, but no, he likes you.  Oh.  Yeah.  That's kind of backhanded.  No, he likes you.  Was he a black guy?  No, no, he was a foreign guy. 
[00:51:00]  Black cabbies.  I want to say hi to all of them.  They love this show for some reason.  I'm up to.  Yeah, true.  I'm up to three black cabbies that recognize me.  I'm like, what?  Yeah.  I know they, they, they love this radio show.  I don't get it either.  The black cabbies, the, the, the other ones, they, I don't know.  Who knows what they're doing?  They're on their Bluetooth the whole time you're in their car.  They're, they're doing some, something illegal.  I hate when I go, excuse me?  Like, or huh?  When they start talking, cause they'll talk out of nowhere. 
[00:51:30]  They'll be like, all you hear is like, and you go, yeah, what?  Yeah.  And then they don't acknowledge you.  They just keep looking forward.  But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but.  You're like, oh, he's talking.  I get it on his Bluetooth.  Well, now that we're talking about cabbies, we can play Stephen Lynch's Taxi Driver song.  Yes.  Any, any tie into anything?  Are we going to play a song?  What's with the paint on the cabs in New York?  Uh, I was trying to figure that out.  What is that?  It looks like someone did it with a brush and a roller.  It's very hippie-ish looking. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, yeah.  On the front and back trucks, right?  I think it, I think it's some kind of, uh, art project that's raising money for something,  right?  Art program.  Through the mayor's office?  Yeah, yeah.  This just, ugh.  Ugh.  I'll tell you how you, you design, uh, the hood of a cab.  Oh, boy.  You plow through the pedestrian crosswalks.  Oh, boy.  And whatever ends up on the front is your artwork.  Well, that's a nice picture.  It's got a wig and two teeth in it.  A little string of pearls.  Yes.  A little hairy doily. 
[00:52:30]  I mean, you see the president of Columbia holding his balding head.  I think I forgot that Bollinger hair piece.  I'm obsessed with it.  It's all I think about.  I actually want to wrap myself up in it and doze off.  You could.  And thanks for doing some Linger Longer stuff for everybody.  Yes, of course.  That's for the people that linger longer.  Hey, uh, Stephen Lynch, uh, it's also, uh, make a tie-in Monday.  What?  Not another day.  I swear I will jump.  The theme needs work, but, uh, I think John from Philly started something. 
[00:53:00]  Rocktober is worthy of Jimmy's Phenomenal Song.  So, you're talking about Rocktober, and then it reminds you of maybe some O&A bit.  But in this case, it doesn't make sense.  But now we might have to make it make sense.  See, we did a little cabby thing, so now we play Stephen Lynch's, uh, Taxi Driver Song.  That's what we do now.  Check this out.  I flagged him down at the corner, and he picked me up at the light. 
[00:53:30]  I told him where I was going, and we drove off into the night.  See?  Yeah.  All right.  How you doing, my friend?  I asked him.  Slowly he turned his head.  The taxi driver looked at me, and this is what he said. 
[00:54:00]  Finger on the button.  I'm ready.  He said,  There you go.  Stephen Lynch, everybody.  I remember the first time he played that was the day that I was, uh, alone doing the show. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  And, uh, Stephen came in, and they wanted everything, every song parody at that point  run past Ken Stevens, our old general manager, before he did it.  Right.  Because he was afraid that it was going to be, uh, uh, too much sex in it or something.  And he's like, don't worry about it.  And I was in charge, and I said, just do it.  Just play the song.  And then Ken felt silly afterwards, because there's nothing bad in that song at all.  Not about sex or anything.  No. 
[00:55:00]  Ah, they'll find-  Killing animals.  They'll probably find some reason why it's bad.  Uh, Bill from Waterford.  There's a station up here called Fly 92.  And they call Friday Fly Day instead of Friday.  Oh, I get it.  And they consistently change fry into fly.  It's rather stupid.  What, rather?  Every day, it's incredibly stupid.  And then you got Larry from Maryland.  He writes, uh, the paperwork says on the front page, the Phillies finally, finally spelled  with the PH, uh, made it. 
[00:55:30]  And then he writes, ugh, as far as headlines go.  As we're talking, like, we have TVs on here, and Good Morning America is on, and it's like  the first time I haven't wanted to throw something through the television.  Oh.  They're showing pictures of this.  It's so brilliant what they did to this guy.  And this big news, the predator who was with a three-year-old.  Oh, with the video.  Oh.  And they did a smart thing.  They showed the kid's face, like, online to get people to respond, like, who is this 
[00:56:00]  kid?  Yeah.  And then you find the guy who's doing it, which is what they should do to all these  child pornography.  You show the kid's face, then you track it to the guy.  And, uh, I think he's gonna kill himself.  There's a guy they're looking for.  They're showing his face every three seconds.  Yeah, this guy.  The guy in the video who was with a three-year-old.  He's been put on the news.  His face is all over the place.  How can you not just shoot him in the head when you can't?  Like, help me out with this.  I was at a kid's birthday party, and my uncle was telling me about this, and I don't know  the full story yet.  There was a tape got turned in. 
[00:56:30]  Apparently, some guy said he found it in the desert.  In the desert.  I think that he was probably...  Whatever.  I think he's been charged with something.  Found a tape in the desert.  I think he's been charged with something.  He's probably a traitor.  A guy who traded videos.  But there's a guy having sex with, uh, apparently a very, very young girl.  Like, three or four.  And so the police put the name on...  The face online to try to catch the animal doing it.  Because, like, this girl's probably still being abused.  Turns out, I think she's like six or seven now.  Yeah, it was a couple of years ago.  And apparently, the, uh, uh, the mother, I think, recognized the furniture. 
[00:57:00]  The furniture.  First of all, how do you not recognize the kid?  Maybe, well...  Maybe that's what...  I don't know.  Maybe that's what caught a ride.  Yeah.  But they should, that's what they should do to catch these predators, is even though  there's a rape shield law, but the important thing is that you kind of stop...  Yeah, you don't want to show the victim.  Uh, once they found out who the guy was, uh, they stopped showing the face of the kid.  They blurred it out.  But, you know, with the internet, it's too late.  They are showing this guy's face every 30 seconds on Good Morning America. 
[00:57:30]  But what you were saying, how does, how does a, uh, a cop or somebody, when you find this  guy, not just put a bullet in his head right there?  Because it's, it's, it's a given.  It's him.  It's a given.  It's, this isn't a case of, like, mistaken identity or something.  It's, if you find the guy and it's him, you just, just do, do the world a favor and,  uh, shoot the guy, throw down a gun, say he, you know, pulled a gun out, whatever you 
[00:58:00]  need to do to keep your job, but...  Should be automatic death penalty.  It should, well, yeah.  Should be automatic death penalty, but I would love, uh, well...  Speaking of death penalty, they're, um, mulling that back over again because the Supreme Court's  in session and now they're mulling over the death penalty because they say lethal injection  is unconstitutional, so everyone that's scheduled to be executed has a stay until they get done,  um, running this through the Supreme Court.  You know what I almost, uh, said and I stopped myself in mid-sentence? 
[00:58:30]  I would love to talk to some of these people that are against the death penalty and then  realize, no, I wouldn't.  No, you'd just be frustrated.  It's one of those dumb arguments where...  That never changes the mind.  That never changes anything.  Mm-hmm.  Abortion.  Abortion is the same thing.  I, I, I never get involved with those dumb arguments.  This guy...  Because there's no changing their opinion, no changing your opinion, there's no middle ground.  You just argue back and forth and get completely frustrated that the other person doesn't see  your point.  Yeah, I'm not a parent, but I can't imagine you, you lose one of your kids, and now, uh, 
[00:59:00]  some creep is having sex with your little girl, and, and there, there's somebody that  would fight that that's not a death penalty case.  Yeah, once in a blue moon, you get the family that goes, I forgive him, because they've completely  lost their mind because of a traumatic situation, uh, that happened to them.  But, uh, for the most part, the people want to see that person dead.  And you know the people that go up against Chris Hansen, all you dummies, that say, it's 
[00:59:30]  entrapment, it's entrapment, all of you dummies that think they're entrapping pedophiles, that's  the guy they're entrapping.  I mean, a lot of times, it's not like it's a 22-year-old guy trying to have sex with a  16-year-old, you're like, eh, I can kind of comprehend that at least.  A lot of those guys are this animal, but three-year-olds can't type, so they can't obviously  be hooking up with three-year-olds, but that's the type of animal they're looking for.  So stop defending these, these pedophiles and say it's entrapment. 
[01:00:00]  Good, it's entrapment.  Good.  Yeah, get him.  Well, I hope they, uh, I hope they find this guy, and he, um, let's see, puts up a gun  battle, and, uh, they had to shoot him dead.  And, uh, yeah, that's it.  His mustache bugs me.  He has the mustache, it's almost like they hand out mustaches to creeps, there's a place  they go, and it's a long, thin, it really should be rolled up in, like, a 1912 silent 
[01:00:30]  film.  Uh-uh.  The mustache of a creep.  It's kind of, that's kind of like a Johnny Depp type, uh, mustache there.  That's exactly what it is.  It's kind of like, uh, the Johnny Depp mustache going on.  How can that guy just walk around?  And he went, he just disappeared, right?  Yeah.  He's panicking somewhere.  Yeah, he's somewhere going, oh boy, maybe this will blow over.  He'll shoot himself.  Ah, he can only hope.  Oh, John Waters mustache.  It's the same one.  Uh, Dirty Ralph from upstate New York there. 
[01:01:00]  He writes, uh, picks 106.5 in Albany.  Good morning, ladies.  Hold on.  Uh, good morning, ladies.  It's 69 degrees on this fine No Undie Monday.  Right now, we're going to start your rock top of the right with some ZZ Top Tush.  I bet it's No Undie Monday.  I bet that's how they say it.  No Undie Monday.  I said, um, Monday?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He did spell it out.  No Undie Monday.  I wrecked, uh, Dirty Ralph's instant feedback. 
[01:01:30]  No.  I need audio of that if they're really doing No Undie Monday.  Why'd they do No Undie Sunday?  Because, uh...  Because they're not on the air.  Because that's when the part-timers work and they make no money.  And that's when, um, that's when you go to church.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Uh, Digger Dog from Akron, Ohio.  92.3 K-Rock in Cleveland.  Calls this month, we don't support the O&A show and we'll never play it live-tober.  Gee, thanks. 
[01:02:00]  I hear Rover does a fine job in mornings.  All right, uh...  Do you know anything about this woman who dies at the airport?  Yeah, we can get into that.  We're trying to figure out how she choked herself.  Yeah, what the hell she did.  Choked yourself.  We'll get into that after the break.  Also, um, reviews are coming in for the Van Halen, uh, reunion tour.  They are?  I haven't heard any.  Rave reviews.  Are they rave?  Rave reviews for the Van Halen tour.  Yeah, but these are from fans, right? 
[01:02:30]  Nah, man.  Oh, really?  It was from writers gone that they were really surprised.  Am I gonna get to hear something?  Everyone's expecting that it would be a complete meltdown.  They'd last one or two dates and that's it.  I wanted a disaster.  So far, so good.  And, like, David Lee Roth and Eddie Van Halen are, uh, getting along.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, they're very, very happy to be there.  David Lee Roth sounds great.  Happy to be here.  Eddie Van Halen, they said, uh, is amazing, except for his dumb 15-minute guitar solo.  They even said in the article I read over the weekend, like, the thing we joke about, he 
[01:03:00]  goes, during the 15-minute guitar solo, everyone got up and got beers and their merchandise  and stuff.  They didn't used to do that, though.  They always did.  Not for a Van Halen guitar solo back then, like, back when they were actually, you know,  the early 80s, I guess.  Uh, they would watch Eddie play, because it was amazing.  The drum solo you'd get up for and leave.  And the bass solo.  They said his guitar playing is amazing, but I guess maybe in this day and age, you  know, concert goers don't have the patience to sit through that anymore. 
[01:03:30]  I don't know.  You don't hear guitar solos in the middle of songs anymore, either.  It's like, it's just, it's kind of like...  Very rare, yeah.  But that was the only complaint, and it was a very minor one.  In general, they said, amazing.  Like, the audience just went nuts.  Wow.  And they sounded great.  Good for them.  I want to see them.  Uh, me and Florenti might go to Philly or something to watch them.  Cool.  All right, it's Opie and Anthony.  Good morning.  Happy Racktober first, everybody. 
[01:04:00]  Racktober.  Opie and Anthony.  Just talking about Van Hounds, so why not come back with a little VH?  Oh.  That was great to sing a bar.  I was like, yeah, here it comes.  Here it comes.  No, it's just a loop.  We looped it.  Is this for a little bit older, but we ain't much wiser?  No, no.  Oh, no, Jimmy.  I'm waiting for that one.  I don't think they played any new songs in their recent concert. 
[01:04:30]  We're back.  Oh.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  We've been away for a long, long, long, long time.  We've been through changes.  We've played some games.  The more things change, the more things stay.

You remember the cards  And I saw some of these  In the stationary store  The other day  These are actual cards  We should just  Do this bit again  Oh wait a minute 
[01:11:30]  These are actual cards  You could buy  I mean you  You got the  Graduation cards  You got the  Birthday cards  You got the  Engagement cards  You even had  The death cards  A lot of  Specialty cards  Yes I'm so sorry  You got the  Valentine's Day cards  You got the  Mother's Day cards  You understand  About the cards  You got the cards  And then your  Seasonal cards  Cards for everybody  Stepmother now  Well recently  Hallmark decided  They weren't  Step-grandmother  They weren't making  Enough money from us  You know  At three dollars a pop  By the way  For these cards  Remember when these  Used to be like  Thirty-seven cents 
[01:12:00]  Or something like that  Yeah  Or whatever it was  Do you adjust the card  With the envelope  When you hand it  To the checkout person  So they can't see  Which card you picked  Fan  See  I do the same thing  I take it  Now I know that the  UPC code's on the  Back of the card  Right  So I take it  And I take the envelope  And I put the flap  I put the card  Between the flap  Of the envelope  And the envelope  Body itself  So it's all together  Now the front of the  Card is covered  With the envelope  And I hand it to them  With that 
[01:12:30]  So they could just  Scan the UPC  Because I don't want  Them knowing my business  I don't want them  Knowing that I'm  Giving this card  I don't want them  Like goofing on  A funny mommy card  That I get  Or something like that  So I just hand it to them  None of your  God damn business  Ring it up  Are you talking about  Cards or porno magazines  Cards  I know it sounds like  Porno doesn't it  Right  No porno I'll just  Grab and  Who gives a crap  So the dumb fat lady  Behind the counter  Goes oh whose birthday  Is it  It's not  Yeah yeah  I don't want to hear that  And the people behind me  I don't want  Because I'll do that 
[01:13:00]  I'll look at somebody  That's buying cards  And I'll kind of peer  If I'm behind them  And look and think  Ugh  I bet that person's a jerk  Just like the person  That's standing in front of me  And I'll like  I'll start judging people  Just by the cards  That they're buying  So I have to cover it up  And then  Do it that way  But how else  That kind of is the only way  To hand it to them  It's like  Because you'd look silly  Like if you hand the card  With your right hand  And then the envelope  Like if you put the left up  And made the  No but some people  Just take the envelope  And put it behind the card 
[01:13:30]  And hand it to them  And now the person's got  First of all  It's inconvenient for them  Because now they've got  To flip it over  And scan it that way  Mine is for easy scanning  But that isn't the reason  I do it  It's so they can't read  My card  I don't want them knowing  Who the card's for  What I chose  What picture on the front  I decided to go with  And they always have to comment  About having a nice purchase  Or oh that's a nice card  And I have to be alone  In the card section  When I pick a card out  I don't like picking it out  Which is horrible 
[01:14:00]  Because the last minute  Mother's Day card  Or something like that  Everyone's flying in  The ravaged  Savaged  Mother's Day card section  And there's only like  Eight left  I'm the guy  I'll read cards  And I'll go  If I was a writer  I would have wrote  I would have wrote  This right here  If I was a writer  If I was a writer  But I'm not  This is what I would have wrote  So I have to go in  If I actually cared  About the person  I have to wait  Until people clear out  And then I'll start looking  Because it 
[01:14:30]  There's something that bugs me  When I see people  Looking through cards  And they're like  This is nice  And they talk to each other  Like the two women  Are like  It-bip-bip-bip  It-bip-bip  Talking about the card  They'll be like  This is nice  Oh look at the cover  No look at this one  Read this one  And I'm just standing there  Going  Ugh  Ugh  I know it's terrible  They're being caring and nice  I hate it  I don't like people knowing  What I'm doing  You ever pick out a card  For a loved one  And you're reading  And you're like  Man this person's not this nice 
[01:15:00]  But I'll  I'll throw them a bone  There's some  I'll throw them a bone  It's true  There's some that you read  And it's like  You've been there  Every moment  I've needed you  And stuff  It's like  No you haven't  I'm like  Half this crap's not true  But  She's getting older now  What the hell  Let her have her moment  Than's gearing up  Yeah  I'll call that Mother's Day  Hope  Yeah  When I started this  Tiny little bit  I'm thinking  Oh boy  Here comes Than  With another story  About mother 
[01:15:30]  Oh mother  Than's been probably  Writing his mother cards  I'm going to picture Than  And that little kid going  Excuse me teacher  What rhymes with castrating  Yeah  I'm like  Oh boy  Half this crap's not true  But ah  What the hell  They don't write  The sociopath  Mother's Day cards  For the sociopath  But that's what I'm getting at  They write cards  For other occasions  Other occasions  I know we did this bit  But we're talking about cards  And it is  Iraq  Tober 
[01:16:00]  I don't remember  I don't remember these either  You really don't  No  These are actual Hallmark cards  I swear to god  Other radio shows  Would do this as a bit  This is not a bit  You can buy these cards  We can even show them online  Here's a card  Describe the front  It's sort of a rose  Modern art looking  It's a nice  It's a flower  If Pablo Picasso  Drew a flower  Yeah  It looks like  It belongs in South Park  And it's great  It looks like clipped paper things 
[01:16:30]  The petals are all askew  That's raised  It's a raised petal  It looks like a little piece of candy  You could tear off and eat up  It's so yummy  Hopefully a little child  Can choke on it  It looks like a flower  In Whoville  Whoville  And well  This is what the card says  And it's a very soft  Orange-y color  Yeah  Very soft orange  Very easy on the eyes  Orange-y yellow  I swear to god  This is an actual card  It reads  I wish I could make things  Happen for you  The way you want them to  I know how much  A child would mean to you 
[01:17:00]  I'm still hoping  And believing for you  And keeping you  In my heart  You don't remember  These cards?  What is that for though?  Wait a minute  That's for  That's in the section of  For your friend  With a barren womb  Yes  That's exactly what it is  Okay  Why would you send this card  To someone?  I have no idea  A barren womb  A picture of a uterus  With a tumbleweed blowing across it  I would  Fallopian tubes 
[01:17:30]  With dust on them  I would send this card out  And I would sign it  With crayons  And I would  And I would smear birthday cake  All over the front  And fudge and stuff  Just think of all the money  You're saving  And then in parenthesis  And all the hugs and love  You're not getting  That's kind of  And a Spongebob sticker  I would just place  Somewhere on the card  Why would you send this though?  All kidding aside  Yeah  Really?  I don't think they want  To be reminded 
[01:18:00]  Dear old rotten eggs  Well  Here's  Dear dinosaur eggs  You guys don't really  You don't remember these cards?  Oh yeah I do absolutely  Alright the next one  Oh that's nice  It's sort of a  Very heavily backlit  So it's almost silhouette  A child on a swing  And that's all you say right?  Yeah  Alright  Well the card reads  Children bring us a lot of joy  Ah  But sometimes they bring heartache too  Yeah  I care so much about you 
[01:18:30]  And your family  I'm thinking about you  And hoping things will get better  It's a death card  No  That's a kid in trouble  Is that a kid in trouble?  I think it's a death card  Read it again  Read it again  No it's not  It's not  Schmalsy enough  And there's no  I'm sorry for the boss  Then why the little girl  On a swing?  Because you gotta remember  When your child was like that  Oh okay  And not the heroin addicted  Slut she is now  The emo mess  That she is  Yeah  You know 
[01:19:00]  She's 35 and retarded  And still on the swing  Sorry she never  Wow  Alright  I don't feel as bad  About this one  Because this one  Really creeped me out  Yeah I don't think  That's a kid in trouble  Yeah I think so  It's not a death card  Children bring us a lot of joy  But sometimes they bring heartache too  Heartache yeah  I care so much about you  And your family  I'm thinking about you  And hoping things will get better  Okay  Maybe it's a sick kid  Maybe  Could probably be both  Yeah  You know because  Well that's considered  Kind of sick too  Maybe she's like  Psychologically sick  Or uh  You know  Ready to die 
[01:19:30]  Roses are red  Violets are blue  That hair looked good  On Pete Rose  It looks good  On your kid too  Uh let's go to  Scott in Clinton  New Jersey  Scott what's up  Hey how's it going boys  Hey  Dude I can't stand  I listen to Anthony  And uh  Sometimes when I'm in the store  I do the exact same thing  With the uh  The UPC symbol  But uh  Anytime I see someone  Laughing at a crowd  I have to see what  They're laughing at  And I always take the card  Or afterwards  And I'm like  What the hell  Are they laughing at 
[01:20:00]  Yeah see  That's another thing  You can't like  Laugh at the cards  Most people look  And go  What are they laughing at  Most cards have no laughs  They're not funny  Oh look  80 things pop up  On springs  When you open it up  Whoa  Isn't that funny  Look  No  It's not  Two chimps  Biting a guy's  Face and groin  And it's happy  Reconstructive surgery  That would be  An amusing card  That would be  An amusing card  Would be  Let's go to  Mike in Toronto  Mike  Hey guys 
[01:20:30]  How are you  Hey  I was at a  One year old  Birthday party  Yesterday  And uh  It was all cute  The kid was  Smothering  Blue icing  All over his face  And there was  Pictures and  Flashballs  Going off  All over the place  Especially when  About three minutes  Later  He puked it  All back up  All over the cake  So I would  Gladly take cake  With drool  That's wonderful  Not the puke  Cake  Isn't that great  Alright thank you Mikey  Hey by the way  The whole linger longer  Bit that's kind of  Taken off  Gotta give a plug 
[01:21:00]  To Wackbag  They started kind of  A linger longer  Thread  And it's smart  For maybe the  Newer listeners  They're like  Linger  Well I wasn't  Listening back then  I wasn't lingering  They're kind of  Explaining some of  The linger longer  Things that we've  Been doing on the  Show lately  Waddle de doodle  Here's another card  It's just very yellow  With a hint of  Orange in it  Yeah another one  Very soft  Pastels  Hallmark looking  For other markets  With their cards  Well this one reads  No one said it  Would be easy  To lose your hair  But knowing you 
[01:21:30]  You'll find a way  To turn this situation  Around and use it  As a badge  Of honor  Good luck in  Columbia  A sign to the world  That your treatments  Are working  Oh okay  The big casino card  You hope so  And what's funny  About this card  There's one single  Curly hair  In the inside  Of the card  How did that  Get there  That didn't come  With the card  It certainly didn't  Come from the person  Reading it  And when this 
[01:22:00]  Is all behind you  And your hair  Grows back  You'll be able  To say with assurance  That every day  Is a good hair day  Unless your hair  Is growing  Because your fingernails  Are too  Because that's just  What happens  Oh Jesus  I think if you're  Going through the chemo  I don't want  I don't think  You want people  I don't think  You want to be  Reminded that  You're losing your hair  It's just  I don't know  I haven't been there  But it doesn't  Sound like that's 
[01:22:30]  What you'd want  To be reminded  That's probably  Someone very close  It would have to be  Someone very close  And you know  You had probably  Talked about it before  It's a losing your hair  Because of chemo card  Yes Jim  I just think  That there's such  A better way  To do that  How about this  Under the same theme  Roses are red  Violets are blue  Buy a hat already  You're making  Everyone uncomfortable  Let's go to  Ah yes  The cancer music  Good find  E-Rock  It is E-Rocktober  So you're doing  A good job

[01:28:00]  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony show  You're listening to Eddie Van Halen's  Solo  From the other night  Van Halen getting rave reviews 
[01:28:30]  Yeah  That's Van Halen all right  Sounds good man  Oh what happened  He just cut off like that  Yeah the concert ended abruptly  What happened  Didn't happen last time  He played it  All right  Something's broken  I don't know  Something's going on  With this CD player  But he kept  Whatever you just heard  Or our staff  Play it twice  Yeah he just keep  Looping it over and over again  And that's what he did  All right let's say hi  I'm Mike in Canada  Mike what's up  Hey man I just want to  Point and laugh at the 
[01:29:00]  American dollar  It's not point and laugh Friday  Oh I don't care  I don't care what  Oh Canada  It's just  Stop  Have you guys passed us  It's the same value right  Yeah  For the first time in 31 years  And the last  Yeah  But the euro's just kicking  Everyone's ass anyway  Yeah  I don't know how money  Becomes valuable  What does that mean  Yeah  Just bomb them  And make their money worthless  Hey friends take this  They're all  Europe is all  All happy about their euro 
[01:29:30]  And how they're kicking  The dollar's ass  Yeah  They can't  They can't spend  An entire  Hundred year period  An entire century  At peace  So  Eventually  They're going to start  Beating the crap  Out of each other again  Whatever  Hopefully Germany  We still have better weather  Who cares  Goes at it  And decides they want  To rule the world again  And rips them apart  And then people  Will realize  Hey  Look at us  United States again 
[01:30:00]  I made a very valid point though  We have better weather  That's all that matters  No that's true  Who gives a crap  What your dollar value is  People love it here  Deanna  Surrounded by water  Deanna  California  It makes you feel safer too  Surrounded by water  Can't just have some army  Marching in somewhere  We know Canada  Ain't going to do crap  Mexico  March over with an army  Only thing we have to worry about  Is like missiles going  Like 20,000 miles  Yeah  Things like that  But now we got like 
[01:30:30]  Interceptor missiles  That's what we have to worry about  Yeah  Other countries have to worry about  People just marching  Across the border  Yeah just walking in  Hey we're here  I want to take over your country  What?  And it's not like boats  Can go 100 miles an hour  There's a line here  That says you're not  Supposed to cross it  Right  No that's it  It's war  We're crossing your line  Our forefathers were brilliant  That's a very  With this move  We got a pretty good place here  Us and Australia  Yeah  Australia man 
[01:31:00]  That's got to be  The safest place in the world  To live  That's got it knocked  What's up Deanna  Hey that chick was wrong  About the cards  Why?  I think the very first card  About the  I guess it would be about  Someone not being able  To have a baby  I think it's for when  People are like trying  Yeah alright  Yeah  And then the last one  I think that might be  Like maybe the baby was sick  And they had to get  They had to get  An abortion  Put it to sleep  What?  No  Because sometimes  If you have an ectopic 
[01:31:30]  If you have a tubal pregnancy  Or something  Then you have to get  You have to get an abortion  Yeah that tumor  Because you can't care  The baby to turn  Yeah  So because it sounds like  They were kind of hoping for it  But it didn't work out  Heather Mills had a couple of those  Uh huh  Dustin North Carolina  What's up  What's up guys  Hey  I went to the Van Halen show  In Greensboro  Um  Saturday night  Absolutely the most amazing thing  I've ever seen  Yeah  These old asses out there  High kicking  Pushing 60 years old  Um 
[01:32:00]  Eddie Van Halen  Actually did a power slide  About halfway across the stage  Um  They were actually lapping  And cutting up the whole time  And there was  You couldn't even see  Any animosity at all  That's what everyone's saying  The reviews are great  On the Van Halen  We're eating crow today  Yes  Eating a bit of that crow today  Mmm  Mmm  Except they said  David Lee Roth  He had a couple weird little  Uh little outfits  That he was changing into  But besides that  They really didn't have a problem  With the show at all  Oh Eroch's got some bootleg  Oh yeah  It's all over YouTube  God bless YouTube  You can see him doing uh  Jump in Charlotte  The other night 
[01:32:30]  Let's hear it  Just throw Van Halen  Into your old YouTube search there  It's probably on a cell phone  I'm sure it sounds great  No  This looks like really good quality  Yeah  It'd be very smart for them  To just allow you know  People to kind of bootleg  Uh  Ain't gonna do that  No just get some video clips  On YouTube  Because a lot of people think  That this is gonna be a disaster  Now you're showing people  No look  We figured out our S  We're getting along  We did what we had to  To make sure this is gonna work  For everybody  Hmm  It's a brilliant marketing move 
[01:33:00]  I think  To throw some Van Halen clips  Up on YouTube  Alright  Hey uh  Bill Springer from Syracuse  He's having a busy morning  He writes  Hello Bill  Talking about these weird cards  That Hallmark put out recently  Because they're not making enough money  They're looking for new uh  New uh  New uh  New uh  Marketing opportunities  Yeah  A few new angles  On their uh  Cards  Their greeting cards  Bill Springer's got a card  From Syracuse New York  The front of the card reads  I heard your whole family got shot  Inside it  It reads  So I turned up the volume  On my stereo  That 
[01:33:30]  I don't think that one  Would go over very well  That's kind of niche  Mike from Jersey writes  Uh  Heyo  Here's a card  Roses are red  Violets are blue  Mets suck  Boo hoo hoo  Boo dee ho dee ho  Uh  Uh  Poo poo finger  From San Diego  Can you say  Poo poo finger  On the air these days  I don't know  I guess we'll find out  Uh  But he writes  Sorry your husband  Committed suicide  But let's face it

I got it too  I didn't actually  Horrible  You're a fighter  A survivor  An inspiration  Yeah  Keep that close to heart  Now  Always  I don't know  Is that like  Hope that guy got fired  Yeah that's a little too vague  A bit vague  Could be anything  Somebody's  What got lopped off  The color though  Leads me to believe  It would be 
[01:36:00]  A womanly problem  Oh  Oh  Yeah  Yeah  Here's one  It's uh  Can't even describe  The front of this one  What happened  Don't  Don't rip it  This is one of our  Best bits  One of our best bits  Best  Yeah  Jesus  We're gonna put this  Under the glass again  And break when needed  Sometime  Here's another Hallmark card  Yes Jimmy  Sometimes you get  Something somebody said later  And it just  I know what you're going through

[01:37:30]  For the most part  One of the most difficult  Things we could do  Is to show our true selves  To the world  Yet you found the courage  To say  This is who I am  Oh  Oh wow  There's no telling  What changes will follow  That's good that the card  Is uh blue  But living with the strength  That comes from being  Everything you are  Everything you are  In very big letters  Yeah  Brings it's own rewards  You're fabulous  And you deserve them all  Yep  Wow  Signed  Martini Steve

[01:39:30]  But something  As personal as this  You gotta write  Your own card  People don't know  I'll almost play  Devil's advocate  Something like that happens  People want to say  Something nice  But it's like  People are awkward  You know people can be awkward  Like when they're trying  To compliment your girlfriend  Or your  They don't know what to say  People are dumb  So they look at this  They go yeah  That's what I'm feeling  You know  Cause you don't want to say  The wrong thing  I think I always said  About a miscarriage  Right  It's like you don't want  To say the wrong thing  So you're like  That sounds really beautiful  Roses are red

[01:46:00]  The final card  Thank god  I hope it's for foot fungus  Because  You really don't need  Any more of these  I can't help myself  I hope it's for an ingrown toenail  Or something  Because I can't handle this  Yeah  I've been using  Tough Actin  Tenactin by the way  Have you  Yeah  Is it Tough Actin  That stuff sucks  It does  What  It's not great  Nope  It's not working  It works better  Do you have foot fungus  I don't know  I was in the gym  And when I go barefoot  Like I always go  Oh that's bad  And I just kind of  Shuffle along  Shuffle  Desinex 
[01:46:30]  Okay better  And another note to Tom  I don't have stock in Desinex  I'm just trying to help out a friend  So relax  I just like my girlfriend  Hate the way tenactin smells  So I have to give myself  A good Tough Actin  Tenactin blast on the feet  And then get in bed  And she's like  That stuff stinks  That never worked for me  Desinex all the way  Okay  All the way  How about  Wearing something on your feet  When you're in the gym locker room  It's not even that  Or something  You know what helps my foot fungus  I hold my mech  I'll tell you what it is  I'll tell you what it is  Exactly  I'll tell you what it is  What is it  I'll tell you what it is 
[01:47:00]  What is it  Because people don't  Like dry each individual toe  When they get out of the shower  Well you should  So you go into socks  A little moist  And if you're working out a lot  And stuff  There's a little action  There as well  And the fungus grows  You should definitely dry  How many people really dry  Each individual toe  After getting out of the shower  You got to  Well not everyone's  A freak like yourself  No no  I'm not a freak  You are a toe fan  I'll dry my feet real fast  But you know  You got to get  All the moisture out  From in between the toes 
[01:47:30]  And then if you're working out  On top of that  Then there you go  And then you don't get out of the shower  And throw your socks on immediately  Do you  No  I wear them in the shower  But there's probably still some moisture  You wear them in the shower  If I wash my socks  I have foot shame  That could be the problem  You just  Gush into your shoe  With your wet sock  Yes I do  Wet fungus sock  What I do is  I always shower in my socks  And in my underpants  And then I just put my clothing back on  With those things soggy  I like a good soggy sock 
[01:48:00]  A lady likes a man  With a soggy pair of socks on  Do you  Alright you shower  You put the dry socks on  You go back into the bathroom  And you soak in a little water  That sucks  Change the socks or no  Immediately  I despise wet feet  That sucks  It depends how much water  I soak in  Yeah how much  If it's a little bit  You could just kind of  You could dry it off  Yeah  Alright  If it's a lot  You're screwed  Here's the final card  It's purple  Purple  Alright let me think  Talk about a C word 
[01:48:30]  No way  What?  Is that what  The first thing is  Talk about a C word?  Do you have Alzheimer's?  We did this bit  Dude I have no recollection  Of talk about a C word  I remember the other ones  Why didn't we just get  New cards for the bit?  Which one was this?  Because they don't really have  I don't have any new ones  These are the ones  Yeah  Talk about a C word  And these are real  Hallmark cards by the way  This is not a morning show bit  I think I know what  The C word is  Talk about a C word 
[01:49:00]  And you can even go to  Their website  Check it out for yourself  Wait let me guess  What?  Talk about the C word  Happy anniversary honey  You are one  And I hope you get it  They're just taking  The wrong approach  With this card  Because it says  Talk about a C word  Crummy comes to mind  When you think C word  The word crummy comes to mind  No  Not even when I'm eating  A bun  Talk about the N word  That's what it would be  That's what it's like  It's like talk about the N word 
[01:49:30]  Nitpicky  It's not that  Right  People hear C word  They think one thing  Well crummy  N word  Crummy comes to mind  Crummy  Wish you  Wish you weren't feeling that way  Yes  But some good words  Start with C  Like  No  Canarsie  Alright  I'm sorry you have  Canarsie  Wait good words  Start with C  Good words to start with C 
[01:50:00]  Yeah  Like  Cat  Don't you dare  By the way  Don't you dare  Club soda Kenny  Don't have to tase me  Just gonna say  The Jack Jack  What's Jack Jack  He's my cat  Little trivia  Where'd you get your cat  You bought it  You from the little shelter 
[01:50:30]  No  Another guess  No  Steve  Enough about the cat  Baseball  Give me the cat  I like turtles  There you go  Don't tase me bro  There you go  You're cured  A good C word  Someone is suggesting  Chiasano  This is C 
[01:51:00]  I didn't even think of this  Yes  Yes  Good words to start with C  Like courage  You have lots of that  Oh okay  Comfort  Creep  You're wished a bunch  And caring  You're surrounded by it  A cancer card everybody  Is that what it was  Here's another  Now get in your car  Because you're bumming us out  Go sleep on 
[01:51:30]  Go sleep on the cot  Here's another  Good word that starts with the letter C  Cash  Yeah  Cash is good  Cash for gold dot com  It's the Opie and Anthony show  Show flew by today huh  Certainly did 
[01:52:00]  Getting ready to play  What did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show  I have an update by the way  Oh you do  What's up Jimmy  Creepy pedophile  The guy who turned in that tape  I told you  Darren Tuck  His name is  He's going to be formally charged  Possession of child pornography  They said he might have had it for five months  So apparently he gave it like a real long look over  They said that  He said he found it in the desert  But it showed no signs of weathering  Or  If it's a tape in a desert  There's going to probably be some problems with it  And authorities are still searching for the guy who's in the tape 
[01:52:30]  Chester Stiles  Chester Stiles  Chester  Chester Stiles  Chester the molester  You remember that from  Oh my goodness  Do you remember that  Typical name  But good luck  Find him  Cops  Just shoot him  In the head  And  Throw down a weapon  And be done with him  Say he drew on you  Someone  Unfortunately they hung up  But he was onto something  Because we were talking about the death penalty  And then  I said I don't even want to argue  Because it's one of those dumb arguments  That just no one wins 
[01:53:00]  And he  Called in saying  That he's against the death penalty  And I was  I was getting mad right  Yeah  But then he writes  But I'm for the pain penalty  He's got a whole thing  He wants to do a pain penalty  Oh doesn't want to kill the people  But wants to  No  Pain goes away after a while  When you stop  Just  Just  Kill these people  Get them off the planet  Don't try to be so creative  I don't even care that  You know  It's lethal injection now  And not hangings  Or  Electric chair 
[01:53:30]  Or anything like that  Whatever  Whatever you gotta take  If you wanna  Lull them to sleep first  And then give them the old injection  That stops their breathing and heart  That's fine  Just get them off the earth  Just get them off the earth  They don't belong here anymore  They shouldn't be given a chance  They shouldn't go to prison  I've said it before  People that go to prison  Adapt  Every  Human beings are so adaptable  It's ridiculous  It just becomes what  Your life  It becomes your life  It becomes your life  Whenever you're  You're put in a situation  That becomes your life  To you outside 
[01:54:00]  It's horrific  It's horrible  Going to prison  Would be a terrible thing  Once you're in there  You would adapt to it  And it's your daily life  You still exist  You have good times  You have bad times  You work  You do whatever it takes  You read  And it becomes  That's your house  That you can't leave  That occasionally  You have gay sex in  We'll probably even adapt  To that after a while  What the hell  Who's got to adapt  What the hell  The death penalty's problem  Is they say that you might  Suffocate horribly 
[01:54:30]  While they're injecting you  Oh well  What you should do  Is knock people out  Yeah  And lay you on a piece of metal  In a room  Like in the Star Wars  In the garbage room  Oh yeah  And then take another piece of metal  And press it down on you  Really hard and really fast  Like ba-boom  It just squishes you  But I mean like  Enough tons of pressure  Wow  Where before the signal  Can go from one part of your brain  To the other  You're just  You're beyond repair  So it's fast  Dude I never even heard of that one  I'm making it up  That's great 
[01:55:00]  No one can argue  That it's cruel and unusual  Because it won't hurt  They're going to knock you out  Gently lay you on this piece of metal  Unlike the end of the Terminator  But much faster  So boom  Like a big metal press  And in a fraction of a second  You're gone  You can't be alive  Wow that's pretty good  The guy that invented  The injection  The lethal injection  It's actually a combination  Of three drugs  One puts you to sleep  The next one stops  Your muscles  Which your diaphragm also 
[01:55:30]  So you can't breathe  And then they give you  The one that stops your heart  And he was saying  That I might have made a mistake  Adding in the one  That paralyzes the muscles  And the diaphragm  Because that's where  The people could  Have problems  With the suffering part  Where if they  The put you to sleep  Drug doesn't work well enough  You'll start to suffocate  He said  He would like to take that  Out of the mix  And go right to  The put you to sleep 
[01:56:00]  And stop the heart thing  But then they asked him  What the most  I guess  Not painless  But it would be painless  He said  The best way  To execute somebody  So as not to be cruel  Right  To the person  And I was very surprised  At his answer  It was the guillotine  He would like to see  The guillotine brought back  As capital punishment  That's how it's done  Because he said  It is instantaneous  And the person 
[01:56:30]  Feels nothing  It's just over  In a split second  How do you sell that  To everybody though  But the whole thing is  Here's a video  Dude I know  How do you sell that  Have you seen  The later ones  Like the more modern  Guillotine executions  In France  They still use it  Now?  Yeah  Yeah  There are  People that have been  Put to death  With a guillotine  I don't know how recently  But well within  Times of videotape  Because I've seen one  And you don't see anything 
[01:57:00]  It's like a magic act  They put the guy in it  The blade comes down  And the second  The blade hits the head  The body goes into  Like this  Trap door thing  And the head does the same  And it's gone  You don't see the body  You don't see anything  So in a split second  The guy's sitting there  His head's in this contraption  And then  Boom  You don't see anything anymore  No blood gushing  Nothing  And they're saying  That's like  That's the most civilized  Way to kill somebody  I don't think  It's the actual thing 
[01:57:30]  I think it's the lead up  The lead up  To lethal injection  To me  Seems like  Alright  I'm gonna go to sleep  They're gonna put a needle  In me  I'm just gonna doze off  How do you put your head  In that guillotine  And go  Me  They're gonna  Chop my head off  I got it  Oh yes  Like you're going  To the dentist  You knock somebody out  When they're in a little room  Hold the teddy bear  And then you bring them in  And you lop their head off  It's simple  Asleep  You're asleep  And then they lop their head off 
[01:58:00]  Like they're going in  For an operation  And even if they are awake  Like that stupid stuff  They can still breathe  And I'm all  Believe me  I think that these savages  Should be just ripped apart  By like horses running  Yeah alive  But again  That removes the argument  Of cruel and unusual  As if it's really  Really humane  You put them to sleep  You put them in the guillotine  Like that  And you immediately  Lop their heads off  There's no pain  They're dead  The problem is solved  How could they come up  With the argument  That what we're doing now  With lethal injection  Is cruel 
[01:58:30]  And unusual  Punishment  And the Supreme Court  Is in session today  For the first time  Since their break  And that's one of the things  They're going to be arguing  If it's cruel and unusual  It's the most humane way  To kill these savages  And if you look  When these things were written  And I'll bring up  Our forefathers  I like talking about  Our forefathers  And their interpretation  Of the Constitution  And the Bill of Rights  And all that  Happy horse crap  Their interpretation 
[01:59:00]  Of hairdos  Was way off  Yeah  The wig  But you know  They were lining people  Up and they shoot them  Yeah  You know  And hanging people  So I don't think  They'd have a problem  With lulling somebody  To sleep  A lullaby  I'll go to sleep  And then giving them  Some kind of drugs  That kind of just  The guy goes to sleep  By the way  People have the internet  Out there  You're wrong  The internet  The last guillotining  In France  Was in 1977  Yeah  I said it was within  Times of videotaping 
[01:59:30]  And stuff  Oh I thought you said  They still use it  Oh I wasn't sure  If they still use it  Or not  I'm sorry  If that came across  That way  There might be something  In the Constitution  That prevents the mutilation  Of a body  Or whatever  But that's an argument  They're holding  Because it's a mutilation  Right  And that's where  The guillotining  Would not be good  Now what I want to say  You strap them down  By their wrists  Yeah  Okay  And then you take a hammer  And you hit the tip  Of each finger  As hard as you can  One by one  Ow  By one  Well that would hurt  The nerve endings  Wow 
[02:00:00]  With the hand just laying  On flat stainless steel  Like very thick  And then  The victim's family  Gets one shot  With the hammer  A good whack  On each finger  One by one  By one  That's a good one  That would hurt  Hey let's do a little  Mop up here  Jimmy there was something  You were going to bring up  About hugging in schools  Oh yeah  This is  They've been a ban  On hugs  Not as  For the reason  I thought though  Last year 
[02:00:30]  This is I guess  A spokesman  Last year we would see  As many as ten students  On one side of the hallway  Ten on the other  Going in opposite directions  Like a hug line  And the principal said  That it was  Making people late  For class  Like it's not some  I guess it's not some  Like  Inappropriate  Touching thing  It's just  The bottom line  Is  Because you know  People just want to hug  It was just some  Creepy hug line  I remember doing a story  On our show  About teachers  Not allowing  They're not allowed  To hug the children anymore  Well yeah  Of course not  They shouldn't be  Yeah but it was  It wasn't in that 
[02:01:00]  Perverted way  It was just a  Comforting hug  To a kid  That's having a tough day  I gave a teacher  A hug once  When I was a kid  We had planted  Little seeds  Remember  I told you  We had planted  Little seeds  In milk cartons  For earth day  Little seeds  In milk cartons  And watch them grow  And everybody else  Is you know  They forgot about them  Or just didn't water them  Or something  But I transplanted mine  Into my uncle's garden  And the whole thing grew 
[02:01:30]  And it was a cucumber plant  A dork  And I came in  And brought my teacher  A giant cucumber  Of course you did  I was like  This is for you  And then you hugged  And both enjoyed it together  Was he a man?  No it was a woman  She was very pretty  But she was like  An older broad to me  She was probably  23 years old  And she was an old broad  To me  Really?  And yeah  So I gave her a hug  I was like  Thank you  I was a suck up man  Something changed  In my life 
[02:02:00]  Because I was a suck up  Sixth grade teacher  Mrs. Kirshenbaum  Mrs. Kirshenbaum  We had one of those  Fine fine snow storms  And I decided  Right after school  To shovel out  Mrs. Kirshenbaum's car  Because she was  An older lady  She probably was like  Used to say  Brown nose  Like 32 years old  But to me  She looked like  She was ready  For retirement  And she came outside  As I was finishing 
[02:02:30]  Getting her car out  I mean we're talking  Like there was like  18 inches of snow  Some ridiculous snow storm  Yeah  And I spent like  An hour or so  Just like  Shoveling her out  Would you think  You were going to get some?  I don't know  What I was thinking  Get some  Because now that I'm older  I'm like  That was just dumb  Please tell me  It was the wrong car  And like by shoveling  Like hers out  You thought  The stuff you were scooping  Was actually making  Mrs. Kirshenbaum's car  Next to it  Shoveled in  Yeah you were  Shoveling hers in  And you shoveled out  The gym teachers  Yeah  Hey thanks a lot 
[02:03:00]  Hughes  Yeah the woman  With the mullet  The other thing  About schools  My sister's got  A couple kids in school  You know that  You can't bring  Baked goods  Into school anymore  No  Because people  Put pot in them  No man  This is like  Little kids  Like if a little kid's  Having a  You know a birthday  You usually  You know bring in  Some homemade cupcakes  For the class  Or something  Or homemade cookies  They made a new rule  Because of food poisoning  And all this  Health laws  That if you want  To bring in 
[02:03:30]  You know some  Tasty treats for the kids  It has to be store bought  And not open  Interesting  Oh come on  Jimmy  I'll tell you why  This has been going on  For years  And no one  Has ever had a problem  Yeah but  It's not about the kid  There's some creepy parent  Some psycho  Could do something  I mean  I'm only playing  Usually the schools  Are thinking  Could have  Should have  We're liable  They're liable  They'll get sued  No there used to be a time  We didn't worry about all this  Probably was a bunch of lawyers  That got together  And said that's gotta stop 
[02:04:00]  Because  Of course  That's what I was thinking  If a kid gets poisoned  We're liable  We could lose our  Cushy jobs  Chris from Monroe  23 is an old broad to Opie  I get it  We used to bring in  Baked goods  We had little parties  Yeah  In school when we were kids  And they'd bring in cupcakes  And then we had  International Day  When we had to bring in  Something from our  Our culture 
[02:04:30]  So like the  The Puerto Rican kids  Would bring in  Some kind of  Spanish food  No  Some kind of  Spanish food  And like the Irish  Kids would bring in  Whiskey  No they would bring  Some boiled meat  Awful Irish food  It was supposed to be  Just from your culture  And my mother  Didn't want to bake anything  So she bought  Some Italian like  Things that looked like  Little pieces of crap  And the kids laughed at me 
[02:05:00]  And I went home crying  Of course  Of course I did  Because  They  I felt  Sorry for  That was me  Crying shame  The cover of the  New York Post  And I probably  Did have a stupid  Little mess hat on  What'd your dad say  Quit your whining  What do you whining  So what  The kids didn't like them  They looked like crap  They do  Ro  What are you giving them  Food that looks like crap for  Of course the kids  Are gonna laugh  And stop your crying  I'll give you something  To cry about 
[02:05:30]  That's what he used to say  Stop your crying  Or I'll give you  Something to cry about  You scream like that again  You better have an arrow  Sticking out of your chest  That's what he told me once  I got a cramp in my leg  And it was so bad  I just started screaming  And I was laying on the ground  Like  Ah  And he came over  And he was like  What are you doing  Not even like  Are you okay  It's like  What are you doing  My leg  I think it's a cramp  He goes  Stretch your leg out  Straighten it out  And then he like  Punched me in the leg  A few times  Where the cramp was 
[02:06:00]  And it went away  He goes  Next time you yell like that  You better have an arrow  In your chest  I was thinking  I don't think I could yell like that  With an arrow in my chest  Uncomfortable  Ah  Ross in Philly  What's up  Hey  What I learned on the  L&A show today  Yeah  How to make a Hallmark card  As in  Talk about the C word  Cold cuts  Which is what your major organs  Will look like  When the tumor is done with them  Punching out  Wow  That was

[02:12:00]  Hey Opie can we get  Some fucking pictures  Of the god damn studio  Up online  Amen  Don't we have the  PalTalk cameras first of all  Are we on PalTalk  I'm not  Apparently for something  I just got a  When I go  My cam  Start my webcam  I get an  Unable to capture  Camera input  Please check to see  The camera's firmly  Plugged in  That's this one though  That's that one  Which camera  I don't know how to get to  The other one  Which camera are we on  It's a bunch of new stuff  New gadgetry  We're on this one  The one that's moving  You have a joystick 
[02:12:30]  Lance got a joystick  He's playing with his joystick  Of course  Wow man  Yeah that's my camera  Alright  That's O-Pant 2  That you're moving around  O-Pant 2  And where's that camera  Right there  That's a great fucking camera  And I could zoom in  Look  Where are the cameras in his joystick  Hello it's Steve  Look I've zoomed in on Steve  Don't try to escape you  It was Jimmy  Oh who's the sweet boy  Look at Jimmy  What a fucking fat neck  Can you move Steve  Now get out of the way Steve  Please Steve  You're fat neck blocking  Now look at  Oh wow  I could zoom in  Zoom in on my fucking liver spot 
[02:13:00]  Zoomed in on his head  Look at this  It looks like a foreign planet  Wow look at  We've landed on planet shit dick  Look at that  You're very sweet  Wow that's something  This is fucking great  Dude you know how many  Upskirt shots we can get with this  Oh yeah  Just ridiculous  Oh dude  Upskirt  What do they say in a pal talk  Much better cameras or what  I don't know  Why don't you know 
[02:13:30]  I'm fiddling  Because he's fiddling  Because I can't read the pal talk  Holy shit  While I'm  I can only read mine  It's saying  They're saying  Can I talk  Anthony  I'm saying Austin  You know what the best part of this is  Steve is in the way  Of every fucking picture  I know  You're like fucking  You know what you are  You're like that little  That little bright thing  In the sixth sense  Every photo of the kid  You just show up in  You know it's  You know it's  Maybe it could be corrected  This is the opposite 
[02:14:00]  Of an aircraft joystick  I pull back  And I go down  Oh good  Hi  You know  Hi people  See it should be the same  Oh hi Than  Look I had Than on there  God this fucking thing  It's Than  Look at  Look at Than  Look at him nervously saying  Please get that effing camera off me  Alright  He's a good camera  This thing's gotta cost 100 bucks each  Perhaps more than that Jim  Wow  How much are these cameras  Wiki  Where's Wiki  Oh how about audio 
[02:14:30]  He's got a microphone  That's right  I don't think they have audio  For the pal talk  What audio  Which would really suck  I can only figure out  Four mics so far  Two four six  Where are the other two  These two  That turns everybody on  Alright very cool  This is Than over here  Okay  Now those two over there  You gotta go to the couch format  Couch format  Because you gotta be in the couch  How do I switch between  What a nice studio  It's amazing  I can't even believe  This is the same place 
[02:15:00]  We broadcast it from  This looks so great dude  Alrighty  It's amazing  We got listeners downstairs  We're gonna bring them up  We got a bleacher system outside  Wow you guys got rid of  All the junk since Friday too  I noticed  We got actual bleachers  How do we describe this place  This place is like twice the size  Of the old joint  Yep  The studio area  We got a whole nother section  Behind Jimmy  Where we can hang out on couches  And just lounge around  And do the show that way  I see a problem  There's twelve flat screen TVs  That I'm looking at  Two four six in this room  And another six over there 
[02:15:30]  We got a stripper pole  I'm just trying to  You know  Paint the picture  Wait is there a way  To turn those off too  Because if we're showing something  They'll get very distracted in there  Yep  Yeah of course  And then we got  A whole glass wall  And bleachers outside  So the listeners could come in  And sit on the bleachers  And check out the radio show  But what's cool about the bleachers  They're very very light  They can fold them up  And roll them right in here  So they can check us out  In this section of the studio  You know what I'm saying  Yep  So it's absolutely amazing  My only point of contention  Or not even 
[02:16:00]  It's not even a big point  Is I would like to get shades  On the windows  Just so we can pull them down  When we need to  Right  And the people on the bleachers  In this room  We have to set up a mirror  So they can see my face  When I smile  They can't see my face  No  Oh we could do that  For the most part  When we have people coming in  To check out the show  We'll be over there  I know  I'm facing Opie  And behind me  Is the big space  No I mean  No they'll be on the bleachers 
[02:16:30]  Outside the window  Only on a very rare occasion  We'll bring the bleachers  Into the actual studio  These chairs rule  I like the chairs  The fucking chair rules  But they don't go up high enough  So we're sitting really low  I don't mind low  Low is nice  I feel like I'm on a date  In that Fast Time at Ridgemont  High movie  Yeah  Where you're just kind of  Sitting there  Yeah  The seat's a little too low  For the table  Let's see  Wow  Someone's asking  Was it worth a two year wait  For the new studio  Well we were 
[02:17:00]  Ow  We were supposed to have this  A couple years ago  But who's bitching at this point  Still no sound for Pal Talk  How are we supposed to get audio  There's Don Wicklin  Ask Don  He's on the second machine  He's on the first machine  What  I think  I think this one is the only one  That broadcasts  Wait what are we  It's like your private machine  And this is the public  Yeah  Oh oh  I want them to see stuff  And hear stuff  I think it has to be logged in  Has to be logged in there  All right  Then I'll log off of here 
[02:17:30]  Wow who's that fucking handsome guy  That's you  I'm telling you  It looks like a fucking  Across the  It looks like a slug with headphones  How does anybody fuck me  Look a headphone wearing slug  Let me stand in front of you  So how are the cameras gonna work Ant  We got what  How many cameras we got in here now  Six  Six  Pal Talk cameras  Actually they're like  Broadcast quality cameras right  Yeah 
[02:18:00]  And then what  Ant decides what shot to take  At any given time  For the Pal Talk room  Eventually  Can't you have two shots up  Or a couple different rooms  You would think  With different accounts  We could have different ones  But I'm trying to figure out  How to get them sound  Get them sound  Because again  I'm looking  Mars is saying you should log in  Get mics to all  I did  Remove  Sam is holding the camera  Like something is really about to happen  Nothing going on here Sam 
[02:18:30]  And  Lock mic  All right  How's that  Are you hearing me  Any sound  Now  Now  Now  I  No  Has audio through  I can't hear you  I have the mic down  But  They're not getting any audio  Is there  Just make sure that the mic isn't muted  Yeah  Somebody keep track  No  It's not  Somebody keep track of the stuff  We gotta tweak for  Oh  Let me turn the mic up 
[02:19:00]  How's that  Any better  Is that any better  No  I had the mic  The audio  Nope  Nope  No  No  No  No  No  Some reason they have no audio  We'll have to  Figure that out  What are you doing  Why is there no audio  I don't know  Give them some audio  It wasn't me  Anthony  It's not my fault  Give them audio  I was trying  I'm trying  Just give them audio  You're behaving like a real Jay with the audio  Turn off  I can focus 
[02:19:30]  Oh I can  Look I can focus  Those are the buttons for the 360  That's nice  Let's see  Hold on a minute  Let me try this out  Jimmy  Jimmy you can't escape  I am the world  All right  We got that working  And try your machine  Okay  I'll just hit something  It's in the hole  There you go  That works  I like turtles  I like turtles  I like turtles  That needs to be a little lower  Okay  Very good  Yeah  These chairs rule  But what  We're not using these chairs  Why  Why Don 
[02:20:00]  What's wrong with these chairs  Because we have new ones coming  If the new ones  Are worse than these  Can I please keep  This one is  I could go to sleep  I know  But the problem is  We're going to move the console  Way up  This console right now  Is like three feet off the ground  Something else  To explain to the people  This console  Goes up and down  It raises and lowers  I heard on Ron and Fez  Because they were giving it  The old shakedown yesterday  Yeah  And they started moving the console  And Fez didn't know  That it moved  And he started freaking out  A little bit  He thought he was hallucinating 
[02:20:30]  That the console was moving  I got queasy actually  When I saw it the other day  Did you  A little seasick  Yeah  Because I didn't know  What was happening  So I had vertigo  I'm like what the fuck  Oh  Yeah  Right right right  The console's on hydraulics  It's nice  Do you ever hand me  A big pen  Like it's a big part  Of the welcome home  I'll fucking stab you with it  Did anyone think about audio  As far as this  With the cameras and everything  It's supposed to be  That if the mics are on  If the mics are on  The audio is supposed to work  Is someone working on that  Let's get to work 
[02:21:00]  Alright let's figure out phones now  These two are phones  Alright  Is someone actually saying  Stop figuring out the studio  Yeah well that's  Is that Dave from Chicago  Who's gonna get a fist  In his fucking head  Nah well let's hear Dave  Dave  What's up Dave  Hey if you were a faggots  When it came in yesterday  Like Ron Fez did  We wouldn't have to be  Listen to this dribble  We couldn't come in yesterday sir  We were trying to  And XM wouldn't allow it  Yeah  Focus  We said  Damn it  We wanna come in Sunday 
[02:21:30]  I think it's kinda cool  We're figuring it out  As we go  Why not  And they wouldn't allow it  Let's go to Clint  In Alabama  Clint  Yeah well I wanted to be  The first caller  But the goofer  That just called  Got off my thunder  I wanna say hi to Jimmy  I'm looking forward  To your program  And I want the first caller  To go meow  Hello sir  Alright there you go  Clint  Unfortunately you're the  Second caller to the new studio  As far as the Opie  And Anthony show goes  Joe Jersey  What's up  Yeah  Don't wreck this new studio  For Howard Stern  You know how he likes to clean  Are you saying 
[02:22:00]  They actually built this  For Howard  When the merger goes through  Yeah they told him  How it all works  Alright  This is absolutely amazing  Don anything else  We need to know  Yeah  Actually  Go ahead  When the couches arrive  Cause we have your couches  Over there  You guys can do the show  From the couches  Yeah  Without headphones  You can just sit there  We're gonna feed the audio  Through the speakers  It's pretty amazing  This is  These mics are really nice  And light too  These are really good  They're sweet  And this processing or something  It sounds much better  Than the old studio  Could we do the CBS show 
[02:22:30]  From here  And just take the cunts out  There it is  Everybody getting their smoothies  Thank you Kenny  Our celebratory smoothies  I haven't shit right  Since May  When's the last  Hoping to get a good  Dump out of this  There's nothing  Oh it looks very strawberry  He's out of practice  It doesn't look banana-y  I'm gonna  Oh boy  Don when's the last time  We were in the studio  Okay it's just banana-y enough  May  Could have been a problem  End of May  First week of June  We were suspended for 
[02:23:00]  June 4th  Okay wow  We weren't here  Oh we were here for one day  One day  After our suspension  Yes  Yes  We're all  Mars  What does Mars say?  He didn't start it  They got audio  Hey you got audio fuckers?  Uh  It's XM on delay  Thank you  Ahem  Well  We need it to start from here  You got audio  No sound yet  What?  I don't know  I would like just a mic 
[02:23:30]  In the room  Would probably be best  For audio  Ah we got  Fucked it through the board shit  Just a mic  Hooked into the system  Hanging up in the room somewhere  So they hear like  Everything  We got  We got Joey from Howard Beach  Figured out live on the air  Equals no show prep  Shut up  Still no audio  Oh wow  There's going to be a week  Of figuring it out  That's what we  Yeah don't worry about it  We're hoping to get a week 
[02:24:00]  Out of this  You're right there Jimmy  So uh  We're going to bring up  The studio audience  The first studio audience  Should we  Now let me ask you  We're going to put them  On the bleachers outside  Should we possibly  Because it's our first show  Bring them in here  Bring  And see how we like it  And if we don't like it  We roll the bleachers up  And we fucking ship them back out  Ship them out  How about we try them out there first  I like that too  And then maybe we bring them in  If they behave  Alright I got a real big problem  With the studio  What's what  Where the hell am I going to be able 
[02:24:30]  To smash stuff  Everywhere  Look at that  You got my fucking  Dude  Diamond plate steel behind you  It's like  It's brand new  Yeah there's lights in those though  I want a computer screen  I have nothing to look at  How about you guys  Mic up  On O-Band 2  I don't know  I don't know if you can do that  Why are we worried about  200 people  We have about a million people  Listening right now  And you're worried about  Paltalk getting audio  I am not worried about it  I am just saying  As we keep going  Throughout this 
[02:25:00]  Things will come up  One of which is audio  Alright let's say hi  To Jack in North Carolina  Jack what's up  Hey since you have  The new studio now  Does this mean we'll get  To hear more live bands  I hope so  That's a great room in here  Yeah that's the plan  That is the plan  We got a huge area  For them to perform  We can put a full band  In over there  I hope you guys understand  We got a regular studio  In this wide open room  And then the second half  Of this room  Is going to be couches  Where we can just hang out  And do the show that way  And look at like 12 TV screens  Or six over there 
[02:25:30]  Six TV flat screens  Hold on  Alright  Let's go to Matt in Rochester  Matt  Hey you prick hounds  I hope you guys have  An 8-track player  Oh yeah for the audio  The 8-track porn  You know people are saying  That that could have been  One of the best bits  Of all time  On the Opie and Anthony show  And I forgot to give  Audible.com a plug on Friday  For all the people  That wanted to hear  That show again  You can go to  Audible.com  And get some past episodes  Of the Opie and Anthony show  That 8-track porn thing  We did Friday

[02:28:30]  As much as I thought it would  I would've put the  When you  This is the  When he said  Tongue my balls  Immediately you should've  Followed that with his  Ah  That would've been like  He had his balls  Being tongued  Yeah but instead  You put in 48 minutes  Of production  It had potential  Yeah I didn't think  It was that bad  I mean uh  Alright  I was expecting  To hate it  I can't change  Camera angles  Let's go to  Jared in Texas  Jared what's up 
[02:29:00]  Hey boys  How you doing  This morning  Pretty good  Good  Good  I love to hear you  Fiddling  And around  Fiddling  We're fiddling  Yeah  Hey uh  Anne  Are you gonna get  A 360 for Halo 3  Or what  Yeah I am  As a matter of fact  Cool dude  Sweet  You know  I know console  Sorry  Yeah  I'm gonna console it  But you know  In this day and age  Of uh  Nice inexpensive  Wide screen  High def televisions 
[02:29:30]  To hook up to  The console graphics  Look pretty good  I gotta give you that  It's not like  Hooking it up  To an old CRT  Uh  But  But  But I'll tell you  I'm still pissed  At the controls  I don't like the controls  On a console  So is there a way  I could hook my console  Up to a keyboard  And mouse  They gotta  Why don't they come up  With that  That's a great idea  I know  It's called a computer  You just pick it up  Well it might come up  Later  I like controlling  With a mouse and keyboard  Better than I do  Those stupid 
[02:30:00]  Fucking controllers  You can't aim good  With that  Little rocker thing  It's because of licensing  That they will not allow  A controller to be hooked up  Like that  Because Microsoft won't allow it  Is that Jim  Yeah  As you just laugh  And try to  Make me believe you  I don't like this  We're not as close  As we are at CBS  I know  It really is making me feel  I'm far from my Jimmy  It makes me feel  A strange  Jimmy's way over there  I'm Anthony  He's a strange co-worker  A strange  At least me and Ope  Can see each other  When we were here 
[02:30:30]  Last time  We were right at the brink  Of not even being able  To see each other  There were monitors  In the way  And everything  Well we designed  This place perfectly  We made sure Jimmy  Is just out of reach  It is too creepy  If I'm right there  His farts will not have  The impact they do  At CBS  No not at all  Is there a fan  Underneath the console  That we hit a switch  And it blows his farts  In another direction  Have that installed immediately  We didn't even talk about this  But I gave Tom  A talking to today  Yes  In between breaks 
[02:31:00]  Because I'm so frustrated  Because  It was an uncomfortable moment  I expected Tom  To throw spaghetti at the wall  And see it drip down  And have me run into my bedroom  And cry  Well there's a big difference  Between regular radio  And satellite radio  Satellite radio  Is completely out of control  And they spend a ridiculous  Amount of money  On ridiculous things  We'll acknowledge that  But commercial radio  Is the other way  Where they're penny pinching  You know what  Deuce bags  They want  Assholes  We're supposed to be  Their big syndicated  Morning show  And they want us  To go to Boston 
[02:31:30]  And we want to go to Boston  We haven't been up there  In a while  And so we're going to go  To Boston for a Halloween party  And they can't really  Afford us  For some reason  And we're not even  I can't ask him for that much  How about that  What happened  Nothing  I can't be on  Pal Talk  What?  Why?  I don't know  I can't figure out  How to change the camera  From like that one  Right  Over to any of the other  Numerous cameras  It wasn't important  What I'm saying anyways  Okay  No it was 
[02:32:00]  Absolutely  So what about Boston?  Let's continue  Eff it  I step in the middle  And then we continue  We're fiddling  I want to know about Boston  We had the worst ADD  To begin with  So we needed to focus  Boston  No  Because I think  It's something to bring  To the show  I mean Tom  You know  We went at it  During the break  Yeah  And then I thought  I went too far  But I was just trying  To make a point  Because there's a lot  Of frustration going on  So they want us  To go to Boston  For this Halloween party  And we're supposed  To be their big 
[02:32:30]  Syndicated morning show  And all of a sudden  They said they don't  Have enough money  To bring the whole  Staff up there  To do a radio show  And we're not asking  For much  Hotel rooms  Travel  And maybe a little  Breakfast  I mean what else  Do we really need  We need security  We can't do it  Without that anymore  And they can't afford it  So then they came up  With this plan  That Anthony and I  Would go up  For their Halloween party  Without doing a radio show  So we would leave  Like Friday after  Our radio show  Drive to Boston  And be part of  Their Halloween party  They can't afford Jimmy  They can't afford me 
[02:33:00]  Fuck them  They can't afford Jimmy  Of course I think  I don't want money  I'm not even kidding  They're like  We could pay for two people  I'm like  We're supposed to be  Your big syndicated  Morning show  You're going to pay  For two people  To go to Boston  So I kind of brought  That to Tom's attention  Because we were  Trashing commercial radio  The other day  And I go  This is the reason  Why I'm trashing  Commercial radio  It's really frustrating  Where we sit  We work for two companies  We got one  That's ridiculous  With their spending  XM  I'll acknowledge that much  Of it  Because it came up  With Tom today  And you got the other side 
[02:33:30]  That's penny pinching  That won't do the right thing  And get the whole show  Up to Boston  So we can do it  You know  The right way  Where we broadcast live  On a Friday  We do their Halloween party  On a Friday night  So then it came down to  At first  It was me and Ant  We're supposed to go  And drive ourselves  To Boston  They can pay for one hotel  Not one  You know  A hotel room  One night  And we're like  No we need Kenny  We need security  At this point in our careers  And we also would like  To maybe take a train  Up there  Because we're going  To be pretty tired  From doing our show  So I went to Tom today 
[02:34:00]  Hey Tom  Why don't you come over  And see our  Multi-million dollar studio  That XM  That XM just  You know  Paid for  For us  As your company  Is penny pinching us  As far as our trip  To Boston goes  That he didn't like  I think he found  That confrontational  Of course  Instead of  A discussion about  The budget  And financing  Right right right  Of course  But I mean  You see my point though  It's frustrating  You know 
[02:34:30]  Well it is  We're not  Slappy and wappy  Like you used to say  We're you know  We're supposed to be  Their big syndicated  Morning show  And they're trying  To figure out  How to get us to Boston  The cheapest way possible  Bob even called me  Over the weekend  And he goes  Look I want to know  If you want  I need to know  Do you want to go  Up to Boston  He was asking me  And I'm like  No  I know what the deal is  For what  I'm going to fucking  Beg BCN to bring me  Up there  I don't  Yeah that's pretty much  What it's down to  But that's how  Pathetic commercial radio  Is getting  Where you know  They want Ant and I 
[02:35:00]  To pretty much  Drive ourselves  This was  The initial plan  And now we got him  Where we got Kenny  And we're doing  A little train  To make it a little easier  But no producers  No show being broadcast live  Because they  They don't have the money  They were telling us  They don't have the money  That's nuts  They're going over the budget  What's the Halloween party?  Just they're doing  Their station event  And they want us  To be a part of it  Which is cool  We want to do that  Hell yeah  So I invited Tom over here  He didn't like that too much 
[02:35:30]  I'm like  Why don't you see  What XM did for us  He wasn't happy  With the comparison thing  If you just brought up  The issue with Tom  About money  Or you know  Things like that  It would have been fine  But I think  He thought you were  Rubbing his face in it  Not rubbing  I'm frustrated  You know  We went down to Philly  For a big huge  You know  Format change  Going from talk to rock  And it was probably  The lamest thing  I've ever been a part of  You didn't like  The banner up on the wall 
[02:36:00]  It was the lamest  And I'm trying  So hard not to say anything  On the other side  It was lame  It was pathetic  Yeah they had a banner  Up on the wall  They had a camera crew  They had a camera crew  In there  For the big reveal  You know  Going back to rock  And the banner was like  Kind of like paper thin  It was  It was rolling up  On the sides  And it was kind of  Taped on the  On the studio wall  And they had a camera crew  In there  And all of a sudden  It was time  And they ripped 
[02:36:30]  The one away  It was so stupid  What?  It was so stupid  Yeah  They rip it away  And there it is  Crooked on the wall  Falling off  The new logo  The new logo  For YSP  It should have been  Like a very big  Presentation  A big thing  A to do  And then Kid Chris  Made the announcement  At five  And then that was it  It was like  Why  We should really  Celebrate this  Where's the champagne  Where's the beers  Where's whatever  Some kind of excitement  Nothing 
[02:37:00]  And just cram into the studio  And really celebrate  That The Rock is back  In Philly  It was so lame  Yeah  I don't think they  They have  It all together  Over there  As far as money  And where it should go  And I don't know  Well there's gonna be  Some big decisions  What are you gonna do?  There's gonna be  Some decisions  Being made  In the next few months  And I wanna make  It perfectly clear  Hey  The company's not  Doing everything  They could be doing  You know  I like being at CBS  Very much  But I love  XM 
[02:37:30]  You like this side?  On a personal level  They've always been  Very nice to me  Are you ready to forgive?  Now that they gave us  This brand new  State of the art studio  Forgive what?  Oh yeah man  Absolutely  I'm almost there  Yeah I'm not even  I'm almost there  I love Elo  If they throw in like  If they throw in  Like an Escalade or something  I'm there  Oh  They got me back  You know what I like too?  Noah  Noah sneaking around  With boobies  Oh dude  How fucking  How we had to sneak around  How we had to sneak around 
[02:38:00]  Even on this side  On the XM side  That we had to do  From their studios  I still don't know  Sneak around with boobies  I still don't know  How they got away  With that one  And I blame Eric Logan  Like why didn't you  Like get Tom on the phone  And go look  Tom  This is my fucking  Radio show  We're just renting  A little space from you  There's no FCC violations  My boys need  You know  To have little boobies  Be able to have some tits  In the fucking studio  And they were like  No  No nudity  No nothing  They have not fought 
[02:38:30]  Like they have not fought  For one thing  That would kind of  Make the show  A bit edgier  Even something  That's not going to  Get us in big trouble  Like just a pair of tits  In the studio  Not one thing  Has anybody there  Or the lawyers  Gone a bat for us on  Like with that type of stuff  And it's like  With the language  They did at one point  But then after I miss  Forget it  Yeah  Nothing  Yeah  Yeah  Bastard  All right  Kenny  Yes sir 
[02:39:00]  We got the studio audience  In place  Yeah  That's great  How many people  Are out there  On the bleachers  Eight  Eight people  All right  They can't see you  Huh  They can't see us  No I know  This is kind of  A design flaw  This is  This is the problem  We're going to have  Right here  We got  Hold on  We got eight people  On bleachers  Outside this  Huge studio window  So  Oh  Even though they have  This nice part of the studio  If we want to like  Have our fans up here  We're going to have to do  The show every day  From over there  On couches 
[02:39:30]  Wait wait wait  Unless we roll in  The bleachers  What  There's a mic here  Maybe that can be  Brought out there  He's screaming at me  What are you doing Jimmy  Jimmy's got an idea  He's going out  Amongst them  Should we keep the door open  So we can hear what you say  To these people  They can't see Jimmy  He's perfectly hidden  Behind that door  Right  Right  I think the bleachers  Have to move closer  To the window  Yeah but the problem is  They're all squatting  On that one end  To see  And since they're all  On one end  The thing  Tipped over 
[02:40:00]  Move it catty corner  Yeah move it  There you go  Move it catty corner  There you go  Move it closer  And then anyone  That needs to walk  Into that office space  Can walk behind  The bleachers  Right  Move it right up  To the window  Move it right up  To the window  Look at them  We're making the listeners  Move the bleacher  Move the bleachers  You fucking animals  There they go  Oh now it looks  Oh what an attraction  Now we really feel  Like gorillas  You know what  Actually I can picture  Them as the gorillas  They uh  Well  The people on this side 
[02:40:30]  Will still have trouble  Once they're in  Yeah but the option is  Those  We can roll it right in here  Yeah bring them in  Some days we're not  Going to want them in here  Because they're going to be in a bad mood  That's the only problem  And we'll yell at them  Yeah we'll yell and scream  Oh look at you guys  Wow it looks like a fucking Marlins game  Huh  I should have said Tampa Bay  Why would you wear the Mets hat today  Of all days  I'm still showing my prize  For the team that I backed all year  And I don't care if they shut up  Do we have a microphone  We can bring out there  Shut up loser  Fuck you 
[02:41:00]  Shut that cat  All right we got a guy outside  With a Mets hat on  Yeah that or he fucking  Just bought it today  It was very cheap  He probably wants to be able  To like talk about  You know some people do that  Just so they can make  Conversation with people  They buy a new Mets hat  And then walk around  And go  Ha what are you going to do  That's right  Right hey  Hey  Next year right  What are you going to do  Win some you lose some  Yeah  Fuck that  We'll get him next year though  All right then  E-Rock  The girl is a college student  She's got her book bag with her  She's very very pretty 
[02:41:30]  Kenny why don't you like  Meet the first studio audience  In the brand new  State of the art  Good evening  She doesn't want to talk  Oh she's shy  I like that  Is she over 18  All right Kenny's got the mic  I don't like that  All right turn Kenny on  Adam  All right we got Kenny on  Were you on pal talk  Yesterday or anything  You can't just nod  You have to speak  With your mouth  Wait  Is this your  No I wasn't on pal talk  Yesterday  Where do you go to school  Hunter  Wow she could hear us  What you major 
[02:42:00]  This is awesome  My major is classical studies  Which means what  Classical studies  Ancient history  Ancient history  Ew  What do you want to do with that  You want to be a professor  Eventually yeah  What do you want to be  An archeologist or a geologist  She wants to dig up bones  You want to be  You want to school  Just so you can learn about shit  And tell other people  Who you're  I don't get it  There you go  I just want to show people  How smart I am  I like that  Bragging rights  What like you want to be a teacher  Yeah eventually  Yeah and teach the same bullshit  To other people  That's like a pyramid scheme  Of teaching 
[02:42:30]  Yeah Jimmy brings up a very good point  I never understood  The people that go to school  To teach  Others  What they just learned  I always felt like  If you went to college  And learned something  That you would  Do something else with it  Apply it to  Something else  But it is indeed  A pyramid scheme  Of teaching  Because you learn  About something  You're then going to  Teach other people  So they can teach  And there's no real value  Or byproduct from it  Other than the fact  That you're just  Keeping this chain going  Pretty soon you're going to  Have a whole society  Where everyone's a teacher 
[02:43:00]  And every class  Is going to be  And in 1940  They're all going to go  We know  Everyone knows  We heard that  Ancient history huh  So this is like  What year are we talking  About turn of the  Roman history  Greek history  Oh ah  That Greek history is good  We know about that  Ass fucking  There you go  Everyone knows about  That part of Greek history  Tell us something  About the Greeks  We don't know  What do you got on them  Well  Damn  I'm not too sure 
[02:43:30]  I mean Professor Anthony  Knows so much  I don't know what  I might know  That he doesn't  I never went to  Hunter College  He's not going to  School for this  I didn't go to school  I watched the  Channel with the  Big H in the corner  Which they say  Stands for history  But we all know  What it really stands for  That's right  Ha ha  The king of the H  Right  He's on there  Every time  It's his channel  Wait you're going to school  You can't tell us  Anything about the Greeks  Well because I'm  Mostly a  Roman studies major 
[02:44:00]  Alright  Let's talk about  Mesopotamia  Sure  We can talk about  Mesopotamia  I haven't studied  You know  That port  The cradle of civilization  As it was called  Mesopotamia  They had  Goods and products  They did  They also had  Writing and animals  Textiles  I want my  Textiles  Hey your mic's  F'd up  What's wrong with my mic  No I was off of it  I know as soon as you go off  The second I go off  My mic 
[02:44:30]  I have to yell  It doesn't work anymore  See but it's not as bad  On ours  Yeah  Yours has to be tweaked  A little bit  Write that down too  Suck this mic  Suck that fucking mic  What  Yeah  Alright back to the  The smart one  Let's talk about  Mesopotamia  Yeah  Or Persia  Let's talk about  Persia  Have you learned  Anything yet  Yeah you really haven't  Been paying attention  In class have you  I have  Mostly linguistics  But yes 
[02:45:00]  Linguistics  What is that  The study of language  But what  Right  Like what part  Like  Well I had to learn  Latin and I had to  Learn the Greek  And I also learned how  Alright give us a little  Greek  You speak Greek  Give us some Greek  I just started  Taking Greek  Classes  Like two weeks ago  Could you say  Savlaki while I eat  Your hiney  Alright and why  She's all embarrassed  Moving on  Why the Mets cap today  Sir  Really  Sir  She's off the hot seat  Now  For now  Have to  Why do you have to 
[02:45:30]  Oh it's the only hat  I had with me also  Oh the only hat  Went to the game yesterday  So  No why the Mets hat  Who do you think  You're talking to  Why not  Why not  How did your team die  They get knocked  That's terrible  That's terrible  I'm sorry  Hey mister  Are you with the college student  No  Why was she whispering  In your ear  Oh Kenny  She's a little embarrassed  Of you  Probably  What happened 
[02:46:00]  Kenny  What are you getting at  No I just want to  See if they were an item  No  No  So what about the playoffs  Get the fuck out  Now  Now  Hey  That shot from Pal Talk  Can they see that out there  In Radioland  Yes  Pretty pathetic  We'll have to change  We got six people  On our bleachers  How many people  Fit on the bleachers  How come you had me  Doing that  What could you do both  That's six people  Including me 
[02:46:30]  That's true  Five people  And a Kenny  That's just  Pal Talk  This is the actual  Physical camera  You're screaming Danny  Alright what are you doing  Ant  I think we got them right  Yeah they're on  Now they're on  Cool  There you go  That's our audience  Look at that  Five people and Kenny  We have to get shades  So we can close them  So you can see on the video  It's reflective  What a frenzy  We have out here  It's a frenzied  Studio audience  Well we're learning  As we go  So that's another thing  We need to do 
[02:47:00]  Is just get some kind of  Shades or something  Over there okay  So the guy  Is writing all the stuff down  The guy with the Mets hat  Were you at the game yesterday  Yes I was  And when did you realize  That it was going to be  Bad news  About 1.20  What time did the game start  1.10  So you kind of knew  In the middle of the first  Why did Willie Randolph  Leave that guy in for so long  That guy  That guy named  Tom Glavin  Probably because he's  Pitched better in his career  Normally has a rough  First inning  Yeah but seven runs  Rough first inning  They pulled him  After five  Yeah they figured out 
[02:47:30]  If he continued  His ERA would have been  182  Sosa came in  And gave up  The last two runs  You expect me to believe  That he gave up  Those runs  Because Sosa said so  You bought that line  Not me  Don't fuck me Tony  Don't fuck me  You fucking little monkey  Alright who else  We got out there Kenny  This guy keeps texting  And talking to people  On the phone 
[02:48:00]  Who does  Who are you texting  I was texting  A couple people from  FBA  And they wanted to know  How we got in the studio  How's the look  And stuff like that  And what are you writing back  Yeah it looks awesome  It sucks  And the show sucks  And everyone sucks  We're not like that  Is that what you're writing  Wait wait  Another broad showed up  Go fuck yourself  Yeah motherfucker  I don't like this arrangement  I can't see everybody  On the bleachers  Alright why don't you move  The bleachers more  This is fuck

[02:54:30]  To promote like a  A perfume  Or some dumb acting job of hers  Perfume  Her fourth perfume  And he decided  This would be a perfect opportunity  To just let her have it  He hit her hard enough though  You'll hear it  Like he maybe he did let her off the hook  But I mean he did get her fucking  He got her so good  That she started looking around  Behind her for help  Yeah for a fucking publicist  To come out and grab her  And grab her  And drag her out  Fucking cocksucker  You know what  Why don't we take a quick break  And we'll get into that next  Okay  It's Opie and Anthony  Live from our brand new

[02:56:00]  We got what  Six cameras  I don't even know  Where the cameras are  I don't either  I finally figured out  There's one over there  In between those two  Flat screens  All I'm thinking is  I want one from my home  To do creepy shit with  There's one way over there  That's a camera too?  Yep  So how many we got?  Six  There's six cameras  One  Two  Three  Four  Where are the other two?  Five  Six  I want to film myself  Jerking off at one of these  I really do  It's all I want to do

[02:57:00]  Paris Hilton thing  Let's try this city player  It's Paris Hilton  So Paris Hilton  Yeah shake it down  What happened  What happened  That just still happened  And played golf  We could've went home  After that Jimmy  That was the first line  Of the show today  Damn it  It was so like  Meet the men's greet  Step right up  And play golf  That was so nice  In that country  But the one thing  Bad about these cameras though 
[02:57:30]  Everything we do  Can be seen now  It was just  We used to have a camera  One camera  Kind of just up there  And an auxiliary camera  For when a guest came in  Right  Now it's like  I reach down  To pull my pants  Out of my crotch  Because I got a wedgie  And it's like  Ant's jerking off  No I'm not jerking off  Fucking  Jimmy looks like  And then they  Like various things  That they say you look like  Let me guess  A cherub  Yes  A sweet boy  A cutie  A molestable fella 
[02:58:00]  That's it too  A bag of shit  Who weighs down the show  Exactly  And I believe  Just before  They were commenting  Commenting on  I think Opie  You are probably  About two knuckles deep  Oh shit  So  I got an itchy nose  Oh boy  Now the rest of them  They were pretty much  Commenting you have  An itchy brain  Because they're  I'm constantly  Itching my nostrils  And of course  Someone saying  I have nice little  Boobies going on  What  I don't know 
[02:58:30]  Yeah these cameras  Are going to be our curse  The beautiful thing about me  Is everybody already  Knows I'm garbage  I can  It's only  What are they going to do  Find a liver spot  On my head  Wow Jim has a fat neck  Weak chin  Old hat my friends  Old hat  Old hat  By the way  I didn't pull out  Any boogers  Alright  I'm just  Got an itchy nostril  Wicky and Steve  On the stripper pole  Meant to be  Don you have to  Hold on like this 
[02:59:00]  That's what we're talking about  I mean Don look  No this is how it's done  You've got a stripper's body  Don  Alright  Paris Hilton  On Letterman  Yes  Hey can you move the camera  Because I got a pic again  Oh no I moved it  To the stripper pole  Which camera's on me  There's fucking a bunch of them  You don't know  Right now  No I need to know  Which camera's on me  May  May  I do believe there's one  Let me look  I'm gonna point  I wanna know what my angles are  I'm pointing at it  Over there 
[02:59:30]  That one right there  Is one that's on you  Alright so if I wanna pick my nose  I go like this  Turn that way  Alright  But then  If I put on camera one  Then you're screwed  You're pretty much covered  Great  It all depends  Right now I wanna show  Steve and Don  On the stripper pole  Yes  Yeah  That should be Mike  They're talking about  How icky girls  Are gonna be on it  Yes  Ooh those icky girls  Yes  I think for all the people  That have been on the fence  As far as pal talk goes  Yeah  Now you gotta get it 
[03:00:00]  Cause these cameras  Are just amazing  Yeah  These are amazing  It's so fucking clear  And it's like a  Six camera shoot too  Anthony's just popping  From camera to camera  You know all show long  Depending on what  Action we got  I want one of these  Alright here we go  So we got Paris Hilton  On Letterman  This is getting a lot  Of talk today  And Jimmy saw it  My gal pal  As I call her  My special girl  Was watching it last night  And I was peeking  And I loved  I loved Letterman for this  He was so good 
[03:00:30]  Yeah  Paris is just a fucking  She's a fucking meat pack  She really thinks that  People give a shit  About her projects  The only reason she's on  Letterman is because  Of the whole jail thing  And Letterman started  By talking about the jail  And then he would not  Stop  You know cause  You knew he was  Gonna bring it up  But I thought  Letterman was just  Gonna move on to other things  What's up  I know that I'm just  Getting Jimmy on here  I'm setting the cameras up  So I could just  Pound between cameras  Instead of having to 
[03:01:00]  Move with the joysticks  Hold on  Let me switch  For the people  There we go  Okay  Here's a  I'm gonna zoom  Right in on your asshole  Here we go  No  Turn around  There  Jimmy's ass  Is it off me now  No 
[03:01:30]  Oh my god  This is hysterical  That's fucking funny dude  Alright  If I was thinking in advance  I would've put like a  Lee press on nail  In there to pop out  I would've got a big  Laugh from everyone  A laugh  Alright  I see we're booting  A computer  Yeah  Rebooting  Alright  You got the camera set  Oh yeah  This place rules  By the way  Now we just gotta  Pop around  Who designed this  Was that that fucking  That nutty Ed Schwartz 
[03:02:00]  That fucking psychopath  Is he the one that did this  We did  Jimmy  No but I mean like  The actual  What made it work  The fact that it sounds so good  And who did that  Well Tony  Tony what a good job  Yeah Tony's amazing  His whole staff is amazing  They did a great job  With this place  Did Ed Schwartz do that  When he wasn't dropping  A videotape in the desert  Leave that alone  You guys want to hear  Paris Hilton and Letterman  Letterman just giving her 
[03:02:30]  A beating  How do I go to track  One on this  Alright here we go  Which do you prefer  New York City or Los Angeles  I like both  I like the weather  In LA better  But I love New York City  New York City is exciting  Though isn't it  I was born here yeah  Yeah good for you  How'd you like being in jail  Not too much  God that was  That was just a horrible thing 
[03:03:00]  God wasn't it horrible  Looking back on that experience  What have we learned  What can you tell us  What's different about you  Going forward  As you look back  Well obviously it was  A very traumatic experience  God was  You know  I did it  So I feel like I can do anything  You can survive anything  Sure  So far so good  This is the edit  We should probably play  The whole interview  Are they cutting out  Any jail questions  Well it's just  I can tell  The pacing is a little faster  You know 
[03:03:30]  And usually that's what we want  From  We just want the highlights  But in this case  It might even be good  To play the whole thing  It's like  It's only like six  The only thing I cut out  From that clip  Was he talks about  Nicole Richie being in jail  For every minute  So  So far  So far  You know  It's  Whatever  And then Letterman continues  It's just bizarre  When you think about it  Isn't it  That this was part of your life  That this actually happened to you  That you were in prison  For God's sakes  I can't believe it either  But it's made me a stronger person 
[03:04:00]  So  And what is it you did  Do you know what you did  No it's great  You could tell she was coached  You know  It's going to come up  So just tell Dave  You know  You're a stronger person for it  And all that  She's really just trying to  Give the stock  You know  Answers  And hope that Dave moves on  But Dave never moved on  She's just such a fucking  A contribute nothing pig  Like your whole job  Is to take a big  Rick Solomon dick  In your mouth  That's what you do 
[03:04:30]  Yeah  You're a fucking  You're an entitled cunt  And your whole job  Is to swallow  An impressive dick  By the way  You got a couple good laughs  Out of that line Jimmy  But we can't hear him  But that's another thing  We need to like  Be able to  You know  Turn  A mic for the audience  On and off  Oh hi guys  Yeah  So we can hear him  In the background  How come they're still out there  We wanted to bring them in  After the break  Bring them in  As long as they're quiet  Hold on  Bring them in  Gang  The bleachers are inside the studio  Over there  They're over there  We need them over there 
[03:05:00]  Here they come  That's a mistake  I gotta remember  Not to do  What  Not put on cable one  Put on cam one  For Jimmy  Because I went to go to Jimmy  And they got a Pop Tart commercial  Aw  Aw  I guess  We could also pop up  What we're watching  Yeah  On Pal Talk  That fucking computer screen  Has like  The computer on it  But it's like  It's clear  Yeah  It's really  Do all TVs look that good?  Yeah  That's how my computer screen 
[03:05:30]  Is at my house  I wanna do that  At my house  I took an old TV  And made it into my monitor  Yeah your monitor  Definitely good for pornography  Oh don't be fresh  Alright here we go  Back to Paris on Letterman  I don't think I'm  I don't want to do that  I don't know  It was something about driving  With an invalid license  Oh yeah  Yeah  Yeah  And well you learned your lesson  Do you drive now? 
[03:06:00]  Yes  And when you go out  Do you still use alcohol?  Do you drink at all?  If I have a driver  No  You have a driver  That's very important  If you're gonna go out  And you're gonna have something to drink  You should have a designated driver  Everyone should  Definitely  Yeah well that's good  And do you  Have your friends  Treated you differently  Since you've been out  Of the slammer?  No  People think that I was really strong  That I went through it  So  Can you pause that right there please?  That's why she should be shot 
[03:06:30]  People think I was really strong  Cause you fucking strong  She blubbered  The big fucking video grab  Was her blubbering  And screaming mom  Yeah  Well who thought you were strong?  Mommy  Who folded cheaper  And faster than her?  The Mets  Sorry Mets fan  Hardy har  She fucking  She was screaming  Mom  No one thought she was strong 
[03:07:00]  Yeah  What a self-centered twat  I hope she fucking  Loses her legs  Not even in an accident  People think that I was really strong  That I went through it  Hope she leaves them somewhere  Around some guy's neck  Sure  Around the back of one of the Lakers  Fucking  Teeth are being knocked out  People think that I was really strong  That I went through it  So  God it was just ugly wasn't it?  Did you  Have you  Have you made  But I've moved on with my life  So I don't really want to talk about it anymore 
[03:07:30]  I know  See now  This is where you and I are different  Because this is  All I want to talk about  See  Good for Dave man  How great is he  And then  At this point  She's just beyond annoying  She looks great though man  She's looking behind her  Looking for help  Because you know  In her life  She gets help all the time  When she gets in trouble  But this time around  There was no one there  To help her  Have you  Did you make any friends 
[03:08:00]  While you were in jail?  I'm not answering  Any more questions  No more questions  I'm here for my clothing line  And my movie  And my perfume  I'm not here to talk about that  But I would just say  That a person in your position  Could serve now  As I think  An exemplary role model  For youngsters  And there's a lot of trouble  In the world for kids  They have to be very careful  And they see now  What has happened to you  And it might occur to them  My gosh  If it happens to someone  You know  Wealthy and famous  And powerful  It might happen to me  So I better straighten 
[03:08:30]  My life out  Exactly  Yeah  And do you get  Correspondence like that  From kids and teachers  And clergymen and stuff?  I'm going on  To the next question  Yeah okay  I'm over it  What a fucking  How do you not  Hate this woman's guts?  She is just  An entitled  Spoiled  Cunt  We got the video up  Look at her  She's pouting  And she's moving  Her leg back and forth  Really fast  She's so uncomfortable  She's not comfortable  Unless she's being shot  In green light  And there's a fucking 
[03:09:00]  There's a fucking  Pussy stretcher  Shut down her throat  That's what she is  You're a fucking  Yeah  She's a heart  The only reason  That heart beats  Is to keep that mouth wet  And that pussy ready  If that fucking pussy dries up  Or your mouth gets cancer  The heart should just stop  I love her hair  Though  It's kind of smart  And sassy  Sassy  It looks good  She has sassy hair  Yeah  I love you Paris  Love you too  Yeah 
[03:09:30]  Somebody you met in prison  Because  Wow  He did not let up  Now  There's other things  To talk about  No we really should  I didn't come here  To talk about this  That was like  A long time ago  Because you know  Because you know what happened  The week  The week that you were  Supposed to be on the show  You had to go away  So now  I haven't seen this  I know 
[03:10:00]  And now you're making me sad  That I came  Oh no no no  Please don't  Don't be sad  Are you really sad  No  Are you feeling better now  Stop talking about it  Yes  I'll buy you a parakeet  See this is where  He should have went in  For the kill  But he stopped right there  Yeah he definitely  Could have gotten her crying  He had her  He fucking  Would have been great  He still  Oh yeah  She just showed  What a fucking  What a no personality  Valueless  Twat she is 
[03:10:30]  She's a fucking  She has no  Value  If she's not on her back  Or on her hands and knees  She shouldn't exist  She should be a fucking hologram  Unless there's a dick in her  That's what you're built to do  Spend your father's money  And suck the dicks  Of fucking guys  Named Rick Solomon  Oh did Rick fucking  Pound her well  He's marrying  Pam Anderson  Is he really  They got a license  To get married in Vegas  That's good  She's another integrity 
[03:11:00]  Filled fucking individual  Hepatitis  Annie beat me  Sure I'll take him back again  What an enchantress  What do you have to do  To fucking get rid of this broad  Fucking give her hepatitis  And beat her  And she still shows up again  With her big fake tits  Love me  We got Nick in Arkansas  Nick what's up  Yeah Jim  That's great  Get down on Paris  Compare Paris  To Pam Anderson  Which is not even  A close correlation  And just  Just say you don't like her  But don't say stupid shit 
[03:11:30]  When everything you just said  Is exactly what your  Ex or girlfriend is  Entitled cunt  Come on Jim  Get it together  You're just jealous  What  I don't understand why  Opie's mad  Cause he has money too  But you're just jealous  Of her money  And I'm sick of hearing  Your rant on her  Like a friggin loser  Hold on hold on  Nick  He's not telling the truth  Nick are you giving us  A frunkus  Frunkus  No dude  Dude  I love  Opie Anthony  And I love Jimmy  But you guys  Sound so stupid 
[03:12:00]  When you pile on Paris  Just like everybody else does  Oh she's entitled  She's rich  She's never hid  What she is  Hold on hold on hold on  First of all  It's never hidden  You're improper grammar  Second of all  The reason I'm smashing her  Is because  Of what a cunt  She just behaved like  On Letterman  Instead of having fun with it  So the reason I'm smashing her  You little goose  Is because she gave me  A reason to smash her  Right  By being  An uptight pig  On national television  When her whole claim to fame 
[03:12:30]  Is that she sucked  A big dick on camera  And then she goes to jail  And then she fucking cries  Mom  And then she says  Everyone told me  How strong I was  So she's a fucking liar  And a fraud  And the entitled  Cunt part came  When she didn't think  That anybody should call her out  And talk about it  And Dave wanted to talk about it  On Dave's show  So everything I said  Was right  And fuck Pam Anderson too  She got hip  And a beating from Tommy  And she still went back  So I have no fucking mercy  For either one of them  Pam is more talented 
[03:13:00]  She's a better actress  But you heard Paris sing  She's fucking terrible  She's devoid of talent  Let me ask Nick  Are you really into  Paris Hilton  In that way?  Dude  I'm not into her  I  I  I'm into all celebrities  I watch the celebrity stuff  Because I'm a truck driver  Me and the wife on the road  But I want to tell you  She never hid  From what she is  Really?  Never cried  She never  Listen Jim  For once  For once Jim  Just listen  Dude I heard you  I heard you  I heard what you said dude  She never hid 
[03:13:30]  From her porn tape  I know that  So  Some of the things  You call her  Are just stupid  You don't think  She's a cunt?  Wait  Hey Nick  Do you understand  We're going to have to  Agree to disagree  No no no Nick  I don't want you  To hang up yet  Because I'm a little  Confused here  You understand  Why we're playing this  Right?  Oh without a doubt  And I understand  No well  Hold on  Hear me out though  Because someone like  Paris thinks that  David cares about  You know  Her perfume  And her acting career  David is being pretty honest 
[03:14:00]  He doesn't give a shit  He doesn't want to hear  About any of that stuff  He wants to just talk  About the jail thing  And she said  I didn't want to  Talk about it anymore  Like she really thinks  That she's on TV  Because she has  A new perfume out  Oh no that's why  She's on TV  For a new perfume  And she  And David Letterman  Was hilarious  Absolutely  I love the way  David Letterman  Was joking with her  Well the dude  He was trashing her  And that's what I'm doing  No but you  Jimmy  Every time  This is only the first time  I was able to get through  Because you also 
[03:14:30]  With how you equivocate  Over everything  Last time you were going  Oh she deserves  What she's getting  She did  Dude dude dude  Hold on  She did deserve jail time  You dude  It was a second  Drunk driving  Do you understand  It was a second  Drunk driving  And LAPD  Kind of gave her  A break the first time  Like they didn't do  What they should have done  And she fucking  Spit it in their face  She kind of publicly  Called  It wasn't a second  Drunk driving  It was driving  On the revolt  No she got 
[03:15:00]  Two DWIs  And the fact  That you know that  You really should  Fucking hit a poll  You're a guy  And you know that  For a fact  You're a Paris Hilton fan  Did you fucking  Listen to the stars  Shine and cry  You fucking sissy  Dude  I am a Paris Hilton fan  How can you be  She's contributed  Nothing you dope  She contributes a lot  Just the fact  That she has money  And owns businesses  She puts money  Back into society  Wait wait wait  I think she's  Nick  You couldn't be  You couldn't be  I'm waiting for the front  I can't believe 
[03:15:30]  I can't believe  You're this serious  About Paris Hilton  You're a fan  What movie of hers  Did you like  I love  I love  Paris Hilton  And I know that  She's an entitled  If you want to say  Bitch  You know what  Your problem is  Hold on  What do you like  About Paris Hilton  What do you like  About her  What do I like  About her  I like  I just like  The way she  She just  Walks around  And doesn't act  Like anything  Bothers her  She just  Fucking belly  She doesn't act  Like anything  Bothers her  She fucking  Screamed  Mom  When she was  Going to jail  And she just 
[03:16:00]  Told Letterman  She didn't want  To talk about it  What are you  Talking about  I bet you  Would have  Squealed  If you went  To jail too  Good comeback  Stupid  I'm talking  About Paris  Wait wait wait  I went to jail  I was in jail  For only two nights  For what  Wrecking a radio show  With some shitty opinions  Nick I'm really  Confused by you  I'm still waiting  For the frunkus  Like you have  Such passion  For Paris  Oh  After the fact  That you realize  She's hot  What else is there  It's good thing  You appreciate talent 
[03:16:30]  You like this  Fucking dumb twat  She went to jail  She went to jail  And people goop on her  Leave Paris alone  Just leave Paris alone  She's done so much  For people  They're entertained  By when she  Put her arm  Up that cow's ass  And showed  She was hot  Leave her alone  You fucking  Faggot  Shut up  Nick  Yeah what's up  The fact that  I don't mind 
[03:17:00]  If you say  You like Paris  Or you want  To fuck Paris  Or  It's the same  Way I feel  About what you're  Saying  I don't mind  If you  If you say  You don't like  Paris  Or you're  Murdered  Because you  Can't fuck her  No that's  That's not true  You're a fan  Of her though  The fact that  You're a man  And you're  A fan  Of her work  What's wrong  What's wrong with that  Jim I'm a fan  Of her show  I love  The simple life  It's hilarious  It's shit  And it's fraudulent  You idiot  Honestly it wasn't shit  It was awful  The first season  Especially was really good  Ah that fucking  Rich cunt  Shut up Tony  She stinks  But it wasn't 
[03:17:30]  Paris who made that show  Nicole Richie  Blew her out of the water  On that show  Oh yeah  Nicole Richie  Played like  Your part  That you play  On the show  The bad guy  She played that  Really great  Don't make fun  Of Nicole Richie  I'm a fan  Don't make fun  Of the fact  That she did a lot  She fucking  Popped out of  Lionel's balls  She's really  Contributed  Ah no she didn't  Okay  Adopted  Listen  Sorry  Oh really  Is she adopted  Good  Her real father  Didn't even want her  She wasn't worthy 
[03:18:00]  Of love  Listen Jim  I realize I wrecked  A great line by you  Jimmy but sorry  What Tony  I know you're not  Going to agree with me  Because you have  An attitude about  No  And that's fine  I think she's  Hold on  I defended her  Against attacks  That were unjust  My attack on her  Is not unjust  I like the fact  She didn't deny  The porn tape  I never cared about that  Nick I find you  Very fast  Nick I'm sorry  I'm sorry  Nick I find you  Very fast  I find you  Very fascinating  Because I don't  Understand the passion  For her 
[03:18:30]  Like alright  Hold on hold on  One last thing  So Paris Hilton  Was on Letterman  Last night  Or a couple nights  Ago  What did you want  Dave to ask her  Well I loved  What Dave asked her  So how could you  But why do you  Have a problem  With Jimmy  Trashing her  Like I'm not  It seems like  You have a problem  With Jimmy in general  Yeah  No no no no no no  I do lately  Have a problem  With Jimmy  Like kind of  Ever since he got  A girlfriend  He seemed to like  Get a little weird  But I want to tell you  I just don't like  How do I get weird  How did Jimmy get weird  No how do I 
[03:19:00]  I'm Jimmy  I don't speak in the  Clark person  You know what Jim  Ever since you got  A girlfriend  It seemed like  You haven't been  Your real self anymore  And we had to hear  Every day about  My girlfriend this  And my girlfriend  Yes I  Hold on  Turn it up  Nick that  You're exaggerating  Jimmy barely brings  Up his girlfriend  I mean it might be  A little quick thing  Here quick thing there  But there's no  Real long discussions  About it  And a lot of people  The weird part is  A lot of people  Have been saying  On the message boards  The fan sites  That Jimmy's never 
[03:19:30]  Been hotter on this show  That a lot of the  Stuff he's been doing  Has been hilarious  Nick I've always  Talked about my life  If I have a girlfriend  I talk about that  If I'm seeing whores  I talk about that  I liked it better  When you were seeing whores  It's just the way  It came off was better  And because we  We kind of agreed  On a lot of things  Well not on Paris  We didn't  Not on Paris  You don't ever speak  For long  Long periods of time  About your girlfriend  That I'm telling you  So Nick  How could you say  I talk about her too much  When I never talk  About her at length  What are you talking about 
[03:20:00]  Because every time  You bring something up  You're like  Well I was out to dinner  With the girlfriend  But if I was  Why wouldn't I just say that  It's always gotta be  Opie and Anthony  Tell stories all the time  You don't hear them  Always go  Of course they do  Opie talks about  Going away with this girl  All the time  And talks about  Being away with this girl  You're lying through your teeth  Oh my god  If he doesn't come out  With a frunkus  And now if he does  I'll be mad  No frunkus  No frunkus guys  You're just a dope  You're really an idiot  I'm really an idiot guys  If that's what you think 
[03:20:30]  I'm definitely a huge fan  I know but something  Hit a nerve today  It's weird  You're not a fan of mine  Just say it  This Letterman thing  Attacking Paris  Was just some great TV  For once  Instead of the same old shit  That most of these  Talk show hosts do  And she is an entitled cunt  And she acted like  A spoiled brat  On that show  Cunt  Okay well hey  That's the way you feel  I guess  It's just  It isn't something  In a nerve today  It's just that  Always  I would like  Anthony at least  When it came up  About Paris going to jail 
[03:21:00]  He was straightforward  And said  Well she don't deserve  To go to jail  No one else  Would have went to jail  For that  That's how he felt  I felt differently  So I said that  And I disagree  With the way you feel  Because I think  You're being disingenuous  In feeling that way  With anybody else  No you're wrong  Alright hold on  We got Bill  From Rhode Island  On with Nick  What's up Bill  Are you kidding me  You're calling  This radio show  To defend fucking  Paris Hilton  Are you a fucking man  Or what  Yeah I'm a man  What are you gonna  Fucking  I'm a man  Do you mind  You fucking faggot 
[03:21:30]  And then you're telling  Jimmy  He's dissing Jimmy  Because he has a girlfriend  I'm such a faggot  You guys are fucking genius  I watched two seconds  Of a Zeech  Bill commercially  On night  Let's tell you  How much of a faggot  I am  How's that  You are  You are a  I'm a married man  You are on real men  And then I whip my fucking head off  And shit down your throat  Alright let's go to  Let's go to Tugboat  Tugboat you're on with Nick  Tony you can't  Nick you can't talk  Like a tough guy  After you're fucking  Defending Paris  For being in your new studio  Hey Nick  First of all  Let me ask you one question  As a fellow trucker  How in the hell  Do you think 
[03:22:00]  That she should be held  To a different set of standards  What would happen  To your license  If you got two  Deweys  Dude she works on  You'd be sitting on  Your fat ass  Drawn welfare somewhere  Show me the precedent  That she wasn't held  To a different standard  Than other people  Just because she's rich  This is all about  This is all about  Envy  Class envy  No it's not dude  Alright let's go to  Kevin the trucker in Texas  Kevin you're on with Nick  Class envy  I can't believe this  Fucking low life 
[03:22:30]  Piece of dog shit  Nick you gotta be  A fucking moron  Yeah I'm a moron  Unbelievable  And IQ of 150  You have fucking  Cut wife  Out there  Probably driving  For fucking swift  You sit there  And take up slides  For Paris Hilton  What are you  A fucking bonehead  My god  You gotta be  The biggest fucking loser  I've ever heard  In my life  Who's worried about Paris  Truck driver out here  You gotta be  A dog shit  Sniffing piece  And you know what Nick  I don't even mind 
[03:23:00]  You defending Paris  I don't have a problem  With you defending Paris  My problem is  A you're telling me  That I'm not being honest  When I'm telling you  Why I'm trashing her  Which is  There's no reason to lie  I don't have class envy  It's silly  I don't  Or I would hate  Other rich people  I don't like her  And I used to like her  But the more I've seen her  The more she's just  Seemed like a spoiled cunt  And it's irritating  Wait and that's funny  Because I was  The other way around  The more I've seen her  The more I realized  That she was genuine  If you ever watched the show  She was much more genuine 
[03:23:30]  Than Nicole  And she cared about people  More than Nicole did  I don't care about Nicole either  What I'm saying is  You saw her on Letterman  She was a spoiled  Little brat  Who couldn't take a joke  She was just  I don't want to talk about it  I don't want to talk about it  She contributes  Nothing talent wise  She can't sing for shit  She's not a good actress  I mean come on dude  Don't be so stupid  She's a beautiful girl  And she's sexy  I'm never going to stop  Liking you guys  I just disagree with you  And I wanted to  Finally say how badly  I disagreed 
[03:24:00]  That's fine  But then don't tell me  I'm being disingenuous  Or that I talk about  My girlfriend too much  But then I don't talk  About her at length  You're being inconsistent  Let's go to Stone  I'm consistent  You don't talk about her  For long periods of time  But you're constantly  Saying the word  My girlfriend  We found a Paris Hilton fan  Can you believe it  Are you serious?  He really is  I can't believe he's actually  No you didn't  I'm sorry  Alright let's go to Stone  In Mississippi  Stone  Hold on let me  Before fuck Stone  Dude don't try to play  Amateur psychology  You didn't hit a nerve  You're just wrong  No I'm right 
[03:24:30]  But I'm your girlfriend  I'm right  Alright good  Alright let's go to Stone  In Mississippi  Stone  Little Jimmy  We love you in Mississippi man  Oh thank you  Just please God  Keep Nick talking  Because the more  He represents Arkansas  Higher up Mississippi  Goes in the ladder  Mississippi moving up the charts  Thanks to Nick  In Arkansas  I'm not from Arkansas  I'm from New Jersey  Just so you know  Yeah I kind of heard  Like more of a New Jersey thing  I was thinking 
[03:25:00]  When I heard him talk  Arkansas  Yeah  That accent  Let's uh  By the way  Jimmy was in jail  No I believe it  But I'm just  I'm just telling you  I would be scared about jail  You're not going to  Defend the Paris thing  It boils down to  A matter of opinion  No it doesn't  Because you lied  You said I would  Squeal like a bitch  If I went to jail  And I spent the night in jail  And I didn't  So shut up  You would be nervous  I didn't say you'd  Scream like a bitch  Yes you did  You said I was  Okay then I'm sorry  I meant you would be nervous  I didn't scream like a bitch  When I was in jail 
[03:25:30]  I was very nervous though  And a young girl  Especially one who was  Blown up around money  And never had to be  Entitled  Like you know so  Roll over and shut up  Entitled  Listen I'm sorry guys  That we don't agree on this  I'm going to fuck you  In the mouth  And I didn't mean  I didn't say you'd say  Stop talking  And start sucking  It's disingenuous  Stop talking  And start sucking  Just don't call up  And try to  And try to lie  That's all  I'm not lying  Don't think for my motives  And then don't tell me  That you didn't say  Something that you did say 
[03:26:00]  Okay well that was an action  Hey  What about the cheeks of my ass  Jim take that okay  I'm going to come down your throat  You fucking well better swallow it all.  Your apology is accepted.  I accept your apology for what you said that was incorrect.  Now lick my sweaty balls.  I was expecting frunkus the whole time.  No, I didn't think so.  I don't get it.  He's the bottom line. 
[03:26:30]  We went about 10 minutes longer than I wanted on that phone call,  but there was something interesting about that.  He has a problem with me,  and when he says something like class envy,  it's like, dude, what are you talking about?  It's just silly.  He definitely has a problem with you.  You don't talk about your girlfriend any more than anyone else does.  It's just silly.  It's like you're in here every day talking about,  yes, it'd be me and sweetie, dude.  And then he's saying like, yeah, but you're different,  and now I'm trashing a woman,  which is what I've always done,  and he's going, well, you shouldn't do that.  It's just, stop.  I want you to talk more about your girlfriend. 
[03:27:00]  I think it would be interesting, but whatever.  Somebody's suggesting that he's hauling tampons.  In his truck there.  Yes, Nick is a phony.  I'd rather have a douchebag than a phony,  and Nick is a phony.  All right, let's go to Ryan in Buffalo.  Ryan.  Hello.  There's the front.  What'd you call from inside a septic tank?  So what do you guys think of the bleachers in here  instead of out there?  I preferred.  You like them?  Very nice.  You guys like the studio? 
[03:27:30]  I love that we can see the feedback in the calls, too.  It's like being part of the show.  Oh, well, we'll be shutting those off.  Thank you, because we're tweaking the whole thing.  The feedback up there.  Are you nuts?  Well, they can see six flat screens  from the bleachers over there.  And you're looking at the calls that are coming in.  That is kind of cool.  I can see some of the posts.  Dude, you should read.  The fucking people hate them.  I was there.  I saw it on the feedback.  Go fuck yourselves.  They don't...  No, you can put that back up. 
[03:28:00]  I don't care.  They get cable television.  Huh?  They get cable.  Yeah, we're going to put on Nickelodeon for you guys.  Basic cable fans, guys.  Basic cable.  Dude, why do you have a problem with these people?  They're the only ones that showed up today.  Yeah, that's true.  We have some hardcore fans.  These are the guys that showed up for the first day.  Six of them.  Did put on a slamming tailgate party, too.  I'd give it to them for that, but I don't know.  Wow.  Just go there, and it's just all bad shit.  It's all a bunch of nasty people writing nasty stuff.  Bunch of fucking fat homos in trucks weeping at the thought of Paris in jail for a week. 
[03:28:30]  Exactly.  What's wrong with you?  I think message boards in general have to regroup every once in a while.  That's all.  You got to regroup.  Regroup.  What are you watching over there?  Soap operas?  Is this the gay soap opera you were watching on?  I don't know.  You know something?  I didn't tune in the next day, so I don't know how the father dealt with the fact that  his homo son was kissing another guy.  Hopefully the R. Bud Dwyer way.  I pulled out a paper lunch bag. 
[03:29:00]  His stupid lunch bag with a giant gun in it.  Now step away.  Don't want anyone getting hurt.  He should have brought in a briefcase or something, that crinkly old bag.  Yeah, brings it in a bag and doesn't want anyone getting hurt.  Step away.  Excuse me.  You're going to scar people for life.  The top of your head launches into the ceiling.  I think you heard a few people there.  Woman screamed.  You think she's sleeping well at night?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Ah! 
[03:29:30]  Ah!  Audio not again?  Oh, well.  And somebody on Instant Feedback, because you guys are reading the Instant Feedback, but  we turned it off for a second.  This one came in for you guys.  Hey, you faggots on the bleachers.  By the way, if you're going to use Instant Feedback, all caps for now on.  Oh, really?  So we can see it, because, you know, our eyes...  They're yelling!  I won't...  What's what caps mean?  Hey, you guys want to hear a fat chick having sex? 
[03:30:00]  Yes.  All right.  Here you go.  We played this over on the other side, but we couldn't describe what it was.  Now we finally can.  It's a fat chick having sex.  Did we have a video of this slob, or no?  I think we put it up on...  Where did we find this one?  Oh, yeah, we did.  She's on top.  She's...  The guy's on his back.  She's on top, riding him.  Yeah.  And, uh...  Yeah, she...  This would make any hard-on vanish.  Yeah.  Do the girls want to have sex, or...?  No, I'm okay.  What?  She wants to, though. 
[03:30:30]  Jimmy, you all right?  Yeah, I'm waiting to hear this.  But we're talking to the girls over there.  Oh.  I'm sorry, ladies.  Go ahead.  I'm very tired.  I probably got like an hour to sleep last night.  Mondays are always very bad.  Because you were very excited to come in here for the first time today?  Yeah, I just kept waking up going,  Now?  And I look at the clock.  No, man.  I sleep late Sundays, and Mondays are always brutal for me.  Fat chick having sex.  Mm-hmm.  I like how you press the button.  There it is. 
[03:31:00]  Still on board.  It's fine.  Oh, sweet.  Oh, God, Bill.  Oh, God, Bill.  Oh, God, Bill!  No longer agree.  I think this was the guy. 
[03:31:30]  Yeah, I know.  It's still the chick, right?  Is he fucking with a hoagie?  Oh, God!  Do you feel good?  Woo! 
[03:32:00]  Woo!  You broke me!  Oh, God!  Oh, God!  Oh, God!  Oh, God!  Oh, God!  Oh, God!  Oh, God!  Oh, God!  Oh!  Oh, God! 
[03:32:30]  Oh!  Oh, God!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, God!  Oh, God!  Oh, God!  Oh, God!  Oh, sweetheart!  I'll lick my sweaty balls.  She's not as fat as I thought she'd be.  She's thick and plump, but she's not a big fat slob.  Like, she's fuckable, definitely.  Not a giant fatty, but she got some meat to her. 
[03:33:00]  If she has hair on her pussy, and she probably does, she's probably grinding the shit out of  that guy's groin area.  Ugh.  That sound, though.  Ugh!  What the fuck was that?  It's weird to see YouTube videos that big.  Yeah.  I keep thinking I'm watching TV.  Like, oh, yeah.  That wouldn't be on regular TV.  I think it was a little tweak.  A little nipple tweak.  Oh, Bill!  Oh, Bill!  Oh, Bill!  Oh, Bill!  Oh, Bill!  Oh, God!  Oh!  That's gotta be the guy!  Oh, Bill!  Oh, sweetheart! 
[03:33:30]  Oh!  Oh, God!  Oh!  Oh, God!  Oh!  Oh, God!  Oh, Bill!  Oh, Bill!  Oh, Bill!  Oh, Bill!  Oh, Bill!  Oh, Bill!  Oh, Bill!  Oh, God!  Someone said, oh, sweetheart, to me.  My cock was driven like tea was spilled on me.  Oh, pumpkin. 
[03:34:00]  Oh, honey bear.  Oh, God, no.  By the way, on the bed, there's a big thing.  What is that, like, arid edges? 
[03:34:30]  There's a blue thing on the end of the bed.  What is it?  Oh, I don't know.  Got to be a bunch of lube.  Industrial strength.  By the way, we play this short version.  This goes on for another five minutes.  In the back, you're looking at a steering wheel.  What a creepy fucking apartment.  Or it looks like one of those steam valves, like, fucking on a ship, on a freighter.  Yeah, she's a belly warmer.  Oh, sweetheart.  Oh, my God.  I'm trying to make it sound romantic, you slob. 
[03:35:00]  Oh, angel.  Oh, God, no.  Quiet.  Bill is tearing that pussy apart.  Jesus.  Never let Bill fuck your woman.  Make a mental note of me.  My name is William, and I like to wear dresses.  My name is William, and I like singing in a palace. 
[03:35:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Roll over and shut up. 
[03:36:00]  Stop talking and start talking.  Holy shit.  Yeah, yeah.  It's over? 
[03:36:30]  All right, it's over, right?  How many times is this bitch going to call him Sweetheart?  All right, it's got to be over now, right?  Yeah.  All right, good.  All right, we'll...  I got a full rod from watching this.  A full rod?  You got what?  A full rod.  Why?  I like the way he's holding her ass. 
[03:37:00]  It looks like she probably has a big, wet twat.  Not an entitled one like Paris, but just a big, wet one, a sloppy one that's had to work for a living.  Anyone in the studio audience have a rod?  Quiet.  No rods out there, Jimmy.  Stop whining.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen...  I can smell you a cunt. 
[03:37:30]  You said I can smell you a cunt.  You said I can smell you a cunt.  I can smell you a cunt.  I can smell you a cunt.  I can smell you a cunt.  Every time we catch you a cunt.  I can smell you a cunt.  I can smell you a cunt.  Every time we catch you a cunt.  Halfwick, rebound.  It's good!  No, no.  Oh my, I'm telling you something.  How did that not go in?  All right, done now, right? 
[03:38:00]  Yeah, it's got to be.  It's done.  This guy should have come like never.  Wait a minute, fligging him.  This fucking powdery extra dry fucking deodorant on the end of that bed is driving me nuts.  How's he not coming?  I don't know.  Look at her?  Maybe because, yeah, looking at her and listening to her.  Oh, I think you're done now, right?  This is it?  What?  He's a chubby chaser.  With his skinny legs.  I can hear you downstairs. 
[03:38:30]  You're just about to see.  There's nothing else that I can do to keep you here with me.  He's a fag.  You're a filthy whore.  Torture.  It's torture.  It's torture.  Sometimes I'm a bad boy, yeah. 
[03:39:00]  Yeah.  All right, they're done, right?  Yeah, they got to be done now.  All right.  Cool.  Uh-oh.  I won.  This bill's a fucking goer.  No kidding, man.  Who's the word of coppery?  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Oh, boy.  She's up again. 
[03:39:30]  Here we go.  Oh, boy.  Here she goes again.  You're going to be okay.  Oh, God.  Well, that was it. 
[03:40:00]  Oh, my God.  My girlfriend has never said my name while we were fucking.  No?  Ever.  No, not once.  What does she call you?  Nothing.  We just both close our eyes and fucking zone out.  Here he goes again.  Loveless.  Another one of his girlfriend's stories.  Oh, yeah.  Sorry.  I don't have a fucking...  I don't have a wife that's in the back with a fucking pallet cart.  Fucking unloading a trailer that I can talk about. 
[03:40:30]  Sorry.  Hey, honey, bring the hand truck.  Let's say hi to Steve in Detroit.  You know, I can't see that video, but I'm pretty sure, is he fucking Mr. Bill there?  Nice 1977 reference there.  Yeah, that really is.  That's a good one.  That video's up on the old website.  Okay.  Sounds like he's fucking Iron Ball's McGinty.  Let's say hi to Ed.  Ed, what's going on?  Oh, we're at...  She sounds like Angry Vents. 
[03:41:00]  Uh, not really.  No, he doesn't.  As a matter of fact, not at all.  Not at all.  Let's say hi to Crotch Critter.  Crotch Critter.  Hey, I just wanted to say, I haven't heard that much huffing and puffing since the last  time E-Rock came running to the microphone.  Oh, poor...  Right?  A little E-Rock insult.  Eric did nothing to deserve that.  But it is E-Rocktober, so...  E-Rocktober.  Yes.  We started that today.  Hey, Hitchcock.  Oh, wait.  That's Eric from the side. 
[03:41:30]  Let's go to Russell.  Russell, what's up?  Yeah, man.  I just can't get over this music.  What's the deal with it?  Was it John Denver in the background or something?  I mean, what little bit of sexiness was going on there is just...  I don't see how anybody can do that with that kind of music in the background.  We're trying to figure out what the song was.  It's country, right?  I like to fuck to the song, Thank God I'm a Country Boy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because he says fiddle a lot in that song.  He says the word fiddle about eight times.  Fiddle. 
[03:42:00]  Let's go to Lane.  Lane, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  This guy reminds me of Lassie from Porky.  When they're up in the upstairs and she's screaming.  Yeah, a little bit, a little bit.  All right.  Hey, before we get to line of the day, we have to talk about the high school football  players arrested for forcible sodomy hazing.  Another story.  I was reading this one and jerking off, and then I stopped.  What's with the fucking football teams?  They're all homos. 
[03:42:30]  Well, we had the famous story on Long Island where it involved, what, pine cones?  Yes.  They were jamming pine cones up the underclassmen's assholes.  The latest three East High School football players arrested kicked off the team.  They've been arrested and charged in juvenile court after police say they forcibly held down  other players and committed sex acts on them.  What is that about?  They probably put stuff in their butts.  The players eventually were kicked off the team.  The three defendants, all 15, each faced multiple charges, including forcible sodomy. 
[03:43:00]  Sodomy is in the doomper, right?  No, I think technically sodomy is anything that is a little odd.  Like, it doesn't necessarily mean ass sex.  It usually is.  But sodomy, blowjob's considered sodomy.  Don.  Sodomy, ass sex?  Ass sex.  Say, Don.  But Anthony's right, I think.  I think technically, that's all, you know, you like about sodomy.  I remember when I was a kid, my friend Dean told me to go ask my mother what forced sodomy was. 
[03:43:30]  Stupid Dean.  Because he loves to say forced sodomy.  He goes, go ask your mother what that is.  I'm like, Mom, what's forced synotomy?  She's like, what?  I'm like, forced synotomy.  Synotomy?  Yeah, I don't know how she figured up sodomy.  Did she figure out what you were talking about?  She showed me with a rolling pin.  I want to see a little animation of that little story you just told. 
[03:44:00]  Anytime you bring up your old friends, I picture them as little cartoon characters.  Yeah, Dean made me, Dean was very funny.  He actually, he used to love to say really dangerous things.  And we were in this fucking, this is true too, he was like 15, I was like 12.  And we were in this place in New Brunswick, a chicken place.  And it was, we were the only two white faces.  So I grabbed something and Dean goes, get your cotton picking hands off that.  And he kept saying it.  And I'm like, dude, what are you, what are you doing? 
[03:44:30]  What an asshole.  He kept saying it.  Get your cotton picking hands off that.  One time there was a fucking.  Did anyone look?  Everyone looked.  It was, I looked.  There was a, we were outside this pizza place, Atilio's Pizza in North Brunswick.  And this big limousine pulls up and this Italian gets out.  Limo driver, real shady.  So Dean walks up to him and goes, hey, are you in the mafia?  And I'm like, dude, what are you talking about?  Stop, leave the guy alone.  He's like, I just want to know if you're in the mob.  And the guy wouldn't answer him. 
[03:45:00]  That's pretty stupid.  Yeah.  I should have left that alone after forced sodomy.  Forced sodomy was good.  But you got me crazy with animation.  I figured I'd show off.  I like the chicken with the cotton picking story.  Yeah.  Of course you do.  That was a good one, Jimmy.  The mob one I should have started with.  You don't follow forced synotomy.  Synotomy.  Sounds like a car.  The Ford Synotomy.  Ah.  Mark in South Dakota.  Yeah.  That song is Only the Wind by Billy Dean.  Okay.  That's the song the fat chick is fucking to. 
[03:45:30]  Oh, cool.  Got the answer to that.  What's his name?  Only the Wind?  Only the Wind by Billy Dean.  Terry, what's up?  Hey, it's Professor Boardbender.  Okay.  Anthony, you're on the right track, man.  Sodomy is anything, any sex not meant for procreation.  Ah.  All right.  Not meant for procreation.  So if I fuck the curled hand of an invalid, is that sodomy?  Oh, damn, you hung up.  Now we'll never know.  I have to know now.  Hold on a second.  There's a lot of things I want to know.  Yes.  Dude, so. 
[03:46:00]  I think anything.  Okay.  Uh, that isn't just fucking in the, a hand job isn't sodomy?  That's not meant for procreation.  Well, you're not fucking either.  We have to, uh, get a lawyer.  Maybe it is.  Yeah, but I mean, like, if a chick gives you a handy, that isn't considered sodomy.  Maybe it is.  Maybe it is?  Yeah.  Oh, we need to know this.  I think it has to go in.  You think it has to go in where?  Where?  Just into the body.  To be sodomy.  How about if you grab her head and fuck her ear real quick?  That's sodomy. 
[03:46:30]  While she's eating corn on the cob.  As long as it goes in, like, you know, like the trach tube area, like, if you'd fuck  that, that's sodomy.  Yeah, that would be sodomy.  Oh, yeah.  How about if she had a cyst removed and you pull aside the gauze?  The drain?  And fuck her cyst drain.  That would be sodomy.  Is that sodomy?  You pop her eye out.  And so hot.  So hot.  You know how warm a fucking Lance Boyle would be?  It would be like hot. 
[03:47:00]  Like a fucking blast furnace, if I must.  How about if she had jaw cancer and a part of her jaw and you pulled aside the fucking  spittle bag and fuck the side of her face where the jaw used to be and hit the side  of her tongue?  All right.  As long as I hit something inside.  Sodomy.  Sodomy.  Sodomy, yeah, yeah.  All right, cut it out.  Cut it out.  Stop it.  Bill Klein saying, hey, oh, handjobs are sodomy.  Yeah.  Wow.  I don't know.  We'll have to find that out.  I'm not buying that.  You guys think a handjob is sodomy?  Colostomy bag opening. 
[03:47:30]  Oh, good point.  The opening where the fucking colostomy bag tube goes.  If you'd fuck that while laughing, is that sodomy?  Definitely.  That, to me, is considered ass sex.  It's really kind of.  How about if you just fuck the bottom of the colostomy bag and don't even touch their  skin?  Is that sodomy or are you just a silly goose?  Definitely a silly goose.  The third incident in this hazing thing, kind of disturbing. 
[03:48:00]  A student said that after sophomore football practice, he was in the locker room changing  when another player told him he had something on his back.  Oh, yeah.  According to court documents, when the victim turned around, the other boy grabbed him  and held him down on a bench in attempted sexual assault.  What the fuck?  I'm going to come down your throat.  Hey, what about the cheeks of my ass?  Something's on your back.  What is it?  A load.  I'm going to get it, motherfucker.  I'm going to get it, motherfucker. 
[03:48:30]  Yes, to Eric in Virginia.  Is fucking the hole in R. Bud Dwyer's head sodomy?  Yes, that would be sodomy.  Oh, yeah.  According to our new definition.  How about if you fucked the lunch bag and he pulled the gun out of it?  Stab wounds.  If you fuck a stab wound, sodomy.  As long as it goes in.  That could be assault, too.  Yeah, yeah.  And then someone is sending in their best handjob song.  Handjob song?  Texas has their own definition of sodomy.  Clint, Texas, what's up? 
[03:49:00]  What's up?  Sodomy in Texas is just the ass.  How about this?  How about if you fold up and fuck the skin tags on the back of a fat person's neck?  Is that sodomy?  Oh, God.  No, that'd be deviant sexual intercourse.  Oh, is that what they call anything else?  That's what we call it in Texas.  Jeez.  But it's just ass sex?  What about mouth?  That's deviant sexual intercourse. 
[03:49:30]  Yeah, way to wreck our bit, bro.  That's not a sodomy?  No.  All right.  Let's go to Danny in D.C.  Danny?  Hey, what's going on?  No, actually, I am a lawyer, and one of your callers said it earlier, it's any sex that's  not meant for procreation, and actually, in Texas specifically, that's why almost every  homosexual act is considered sodomy, because it's not for procreation by definition.  Well, yeah.  So, fucking Arba Dwyer's head, definitely sodomy. 
[03:50:00]  Fucking Arba Dwyer's head is sodomy.  There you go.  Tony in New York.  Tony.  Hey, how are you, guys?  Hey.  Sodomy in New York is blowjobs and ass sex.  It's section 120 in the penal law, and also, if you stick something in that's not like  the dick, it's aggravated sexual assault.  Oh, okay.  So, how about if it's a Bluetooth?  Jimmy, that could be a yes. 
[03:50:30]  All right.  Bluetooth.  How about if it's a Bic pen cap with an M80 tied to it?  Let's go to Brick Hound.  I knew it was a matter of time before we had someone called Brick Hound call.  Yes.  Prick Hound.  I said brick, didn't I?  Did you?  Yeah, I did.  I just saw P.  Uh, Prick Hound.  Sorry.  What's up, Prick Hound?  If you're going to charge someone with a crime, then sodomy is fucking in the ass.  But if it's not a crime, then you're just talking about porn.  Do you see what I'm saying? 
[03:51:00]  Not at all.  No.  If I'm going to charge someone with sodomy, then it's fucking them in the ass.  How about sodomy because you just fucked this bit?  I don't know.  Why is everyone wrecking our bit?  We had a good bit going.  Let's go to Shane in the Bronx.  Shane, he's a cop, you idiot.  Shane.  Yes, yes, yes.  All right.  New York State Penal Law states that sodomy is no longer a legal term.  It is deviant sexual intercourse.  And there are three ways to commit sodomy.  Penis to anus. 
[03:51:30]  Mouth to vulva or mouth to penis.  And it has to be by force.  Well, how come in the paper it's always he was charged with sodomy?  It was just recently changed last year to, quote unquote, deviant sexual intercourse.  Again, how come in the paper it says sodomy?  Because it sounds like a fucked up term.  It is a fucked up term.  It sounds more rauchy, I guess.  Yeah, they like using that.  Did the rancher make you perform fellatio?  Did he perform deviant sexual intercourse on you?  Doesn't sound right.  Yeah. 
[03:52:00]  All right.  The news loves the word.  Sodomy.  Exactly.  Have a good day, gentlemen.  That's one word you never want to hear someone accused of around a nursery.  No.  Sodomy.  He's the nursery sodomizer.  Finally caught.  But you do want to hear it around the old folks home.  Oh, my God, yeah.  If you fucked their teeth when they leave them on the dresser.  If you fucked my orthopedic shoes, is that sodomy?  Wakes up, pops her teeth in her mouth. 
[03:52:30]  The water looks like egg drop soup.  Oh, my.  The Philly tyrant checking in is what your Mets did to you yesterday.  Sodomy, Opie.  Ah.  Go Phillies, go.  Great.  How do you feel about that, Mets fan?  Fuck that guy.  He's not happy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  I think it's time for the line of the day.  Really?  Really?  Wow.  Is that really the time?  Yeah.  Are you shitting me?  No.  The fuck happened? 
[03:53:00]  I don't know.  We must have been busy.  We were checking out and we were trying everything out.  The new stuff.  We got to figure something out because the girls are very conscious now when we zoom in on their breasts.  Well, you were zooming in on her tit.  Well, she could see it.  You don't leave the tit.  How did she see it?  Because it was on the monitor out there.  We have four TVs on the camera.  Was it right here, though?  Yeah.  I'm going to have to move that or cover it or something. 
[03:53:30]  It's right up here.  Because you could get like a...  It was playing right in front of her.  Oh, it was?  Yes.  It wasn't then.  It is now.  Oh, see?  See?  Oh, there we go.  Ah, I laid...  Wow, that's nice.  See?  Look at that.  Holy mackerel.  I like a gal with glasses, too.  Look how close this could get.  Don't move.  Don't move.  God damn it.  I'll fucking...  I'll cut you.  Look, I can't steer the plane in to the hangar.  Where's the cleavage? 
[03:54:00]  Where'd it go?  Pull that chair top down a little.  There you go.  Yeah, Coco.  Come on, Coco.  Put your thumb in your mouth like a little girl.  Okay, here we go.  Zoom.  Extreme zoom.  Are you a Spanish girl?  Yes, I am.  You're very lovely.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  This is very difficult for...  Look at it.  Yeah.  All right, there's the cleavage right there.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  It's nice.  Now somebody won $50,000.  There we go.  Now she can't see us.  You're going to see Litmus' mouse pop up. 
[03:54:30]  He feeds a little spaghetti.  Dude, they're watching The Price is Right out there.  Yep.  Then she's changing it.  How great would Bob Barker's head look with a fucking rifle bullet tearing through it?  Because it's so...  It's so white, his hair.  I've never seen a head more made for a fucking nice fucking full metal jacket clip.  What is it?  Seven...  What's the millimeter on a fucking...  7.62.  7.62 millimeter bullet. 
[03:55:00]  Oh, would that rip right through his fucking old hair?  Don, you got anything?  Nope.  Why don't you come over here and talk to us?  Yeah, come on, Don.  How much did XM spend on the studio?  I think just shy of a million.  Really?  You said multi-million.  That much?  Yeah, I said multi-million.  Oh.  You couldn't say two.  You were close.  You couldn't say two to help me out.  Two.  Two is multi.  Really?  Close to a million dollars in this joint? 
[03:55:30]  Yep.  And that's just for this, my area, plus the rest of it.  Have you farted into the new mics yet, Jimmy?  No, I don't have to.  I've got a couple of quiet ones that were putrid, but this big studio really wrecks it.  I know.  We're very happy about that.  Yeah.  Anything else we need to know?  The couches are coming tomorrow.  Couches will be in tomorrow.  The chairs will be in tomorrow.  That's just the...  What about that thing to separate them from us?  Oh, that's coming, too.  We ordered that last night.  What is it?  Like when you're online at the bank?  Yeah, when you're online at the airport and you have it at the bank, too. 
[03:56:00]  You have the ropes and stanchions that come across here.  Don, you're doing all right.  In the back of the head.  Oh, great, thanks.  One of our favorite things is to focus on bald spots.  Don, right now from the back.  Look at Don.  It looks like the fucking Kennedy autopsy photo.  Because you have Jack Kennedy hair from the back.  You ain't losing no hair.  No, he's got a full head of hair.  But that's how Jack's hair looked when he was unshot.  Very good.  If I fuck Jackie's pillbox hat, is that sodomy? 
[03:56:30]  All right.  Bodogfantasy.net, right?  Yep.  For line of the day.  I hate Plinko on The Price is Right.  Oh, Plinko stinks.  That's the sound it makes when they fucking declitorize you in one of those Muslim countries.  After a clitoral circumcision, when they drop your clit down the drain, it goes, Plinko.  Fucking Plinko.  Bob Barker's a cunto.  She had a stroko.  You guys have fun out there? 
[03:57:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, really impressed.  First day back here at XM and we get six people showing up.  Well.  Yeah.  Boy.  Wonderful.  Sure glad we got the word out.  Or we would have had two.  Bodogfantasy.net, live scoring.  Help me out there, fam.  I've got to read this.  Free live scoring stats, bios, and news that will help you win big this season in fantasy football.  Any fantasy footballers?  Yeah?  Doing well this year?  No.  What's your problem?  Yesterday was that Westbrook was out, but in general, I don't know. 
[03:57:30]  I just stink at it.  You just suck.  Yes.  It's all at Bodogfantasy.net.  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  If the Angels died in a plane crash, the Yankees would still lose four to one.  Yeah.  Because they would stood up their front office or something.  Hey, all right.  I got it.  Was that an assist?  No, I got the line.  Oh, jeez.  Jimmy.  It's half a Jimmy.  Jim had the assist.  Jimmy had the assist.  Jimmy gave me the bounce pass. 
[03:58:00]  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  I have no idea.  Barren womb.  A picture of a uterus with a tumbleweed blowing across the...  Don't tell me you missed the one.  Oh, boy.  And that was in just one side of the headphones.  Don.  Oh, no.  That's not good.  Who should be fired?  Don.  I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  Don is unamused.  Don, you want to fire Stan?  Yes.  That'd be fun.  Go ahead.  No.  I knew you didn't have the balls. 
[03:58:30]  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Roses are red.  Violets are blue.  Tap, tap, tap.  Can I touch your shoe?  I like that one a lot today.  All right.  Anything else from the peanut gallery there?  Your kid should be putting stew?  Oh, yeah.  It looks like he should be putting stew. 
[03:59:00]  There's only one line left?  Yeah.  Oh, they missed some Lulu's.  I know which one got it.  I have a feeling.  Nothing?  It was worth some Lulu's.  I just want to say, all of us at FBA want to thank you for having us in the studio for  the first day.  Of course.  FBA, yeah.  How about that?  I don't see no whack-baggers out there.  They're out there.  Didn't come by.  Whack-bagger?  They're out there.  I don't mean, you know, out there with the six people on the bleachers.  I just mean, you know, out there.  All lines are in one channel, so what's that about? 
[03:59:30]  That's what's coming in like crazy.  Can I plug something real quick?  October 12th and 13th, the HBO special is the 13th.  The 12th, 13th, I'll be at the Reading Comedy Outlet.  I'm doing very small rooms now until the end of the year to try to, I want to put my  new hour together.  So like, those are really small, 150 seat and under shows.  And it should be said, I saw it for the first time over the weekend, your commercial for  your HBO.  Awesome.  Thanks, man.  Thank you.  They did an amazing job.  I haven't seen it.  With the promo.  Amazing.  The email, I haven't seen it on TV, but they did email it to me. 
[04:00:00]  It was good.  They used it.  I hear I'm in it.  Are you?  Yes.  That's the longer version.  I haven't seen it.  The long version.  But the actual promo I saw, the material was amazing.  You looked great.  Oh, cool.  Thanks.  It's going to be unbelievable.  Thank you.  Here's your line of the day.  Here comes the light of the day, light of the day, light of the day. 
[04:00:30]  Why would that happen?  Meet the Mets.  Greet the Mets.  Step right up and play golf with the Mets.  I'm coming, you dumb bitch.  Wait, which one should they have?  Why is that low?  Which one should they have used?  Don.  There was one they missed.  Did they?  Who did it?  From there?  Yeah, you guys got to tweak a little bit after we leave.  All right.  Yeah.  Do it.  What happened?  I'm all written down. 
[04:01:00]  Just with the cards.  There was a couple of good ones.  Okay.  Damn.  All right, let's go home.  Are we going to go?  We're going to go.  Oh, Jesus.  This is going to take a while.  I have to piss badly.  Paul hasn't left yet.  Oh, boy.  How am I going to get my truck?  Damn it.  Roland.  I'm going to get it myself.  Roland, everyone.  Ah, Roland.  That's exactly the applause he deserved. 
[04:01:30]  Roland, over here.  Roland, what do you got?  The war for Anthony.  Oh!  Oh, wow.  Oh, motherfucker.  Fuck.  What's the war?  That's good.  This is the Ken Burns documentary on World War II.  How's that out already?  Hopefully it ends different.  It's not out yet.  Hopefully the good guys win this time.  Did anybody ever hear a documentary called Crazy Love?  No.  Yes.  I want to see that.  Yeah.  No.  What's it about?  Oh, no. 
[04:02:00]  All of a sudden, people want to know.  I'm putting my shades on.  Roland, I want to go see About a Son.  Yeah.  I'm calling them this one.  Do you know what it's about?  Kurt Cobain, the bio.  The bio.  The documentary.  The bio.  But it's him talking for an hour and a half.  Yeah.  We want Van Halen in here to play acoustic next Monday, and we want Eddie Van Halen to  lick stamps with his half a tongue.  Make it happen.  Can you get that done?  And why didn't we get the cavemen today?  The cavemen, they're only doing ABC-only shows, because they're ABC-flowing men. 
[04:02:30]  Yeah, but...  They'll be able to attack them, that's why, for the first round, and they come back in November.  They're expecting to be attacked?  Well, they're only doing...  It's like they're showing up in hairy outfits.  Yeah, they're only doing ABCs.  They all look like Chaka.  How can they not be attacked?  That's ridiculous.  That's why they did Good Morning America and ABC.  I got a new bit.  Someone's got to keep track of the excuses, and we've got to do a montage of excuses.  What else do they do?  The excuses are amazing for these people.  I think it was Good Morning America and some ABC affiliates. 
[04:03:00]  They didn't do Regis?  No.  ABC affiliates.  Did they do the fucking Fred and Billy show?  No, that's Fox.  Whoever the dude...  I just made that up.  That guy and that chick.  There is no Fred and Billy show.  Fred and Billy, which one would be the chick in that one, Roland?  That's Fox.  Did they do the fucking Cunt Lips and Baby Fucker Hour?  Nah, that's fucking CW 11.  Good improv. 
[04:03:30]  Fucking 40 years old, that's all I can come up with.  Fucking lackey.  Oh, the line of the day.  Jimmy, should have been,  Roses are red, violets are blue, hold the horses, I'll get them off.  Yeah, that was a real good one.  That should have been in there.  Should be said.  Thank you to that guy, Yup, from Chicago.  So, we're still working out the kinks, so we can get them off.  No worries.  That's all right.  All right, guys, we'll see you tomorrow.  But, XM, thank you so much.  Thank you very much. 
[04:04:00]  Absolutely.  Thank you and everybody else for a fantastic job.  Almost willing to forget.  Almost.  Very close.  You know what would help us forget?  A computer monitor for Jim Norton.  No!  A little Jimmy Norton.  I have to have one.  No.  He needs something in front of him now.  If you could get 100,000 signatures and a petition, then we'll think about it.  I'm just going to look at something.  I can't see the mind.  I can't see the feedback.  I can't see anything.  I want to flip around in there.  Oh, peek at this, peek at that.  What's Jim doing?  He's peeking.  Leave him alone.  Peeking. 
[04:04:30]  Jim's just snooping about.  All right.  There's no way to end this, so...  Maybe Steve can stand in front of the camera I'm looking at.  He's the fucking worst.  Steve, so far, Steve is the biggest culprit in standing in front of cameras.  I'm not doing it intentionally.  I mean, in the camera.  No, no.  Other people, like, will be in the shot, which is fine.  It's a studio.  You stand directly.  It's your behemoth back is just, like, right there blocking the camera.  Your name should be fucking Stemmons Freeway sign from Stemmons. 
[04:05:00]  Holy shit.  You just have a knack.  You're in a clip.  You don't even know where the cameras are.  No, I don't know where the cameras are.  They all blend into everything.  I just stand still, and Anthony's yelling.  I don't know.  I'm in the way again.  I haven't picked my nose since you told me that they saw it on Pal Talk.  You're going to have to...  The second the show's over, you're going to have to go digging.  Oh, I'm dying. 
[04:05:30]  I'm dying to get in there.  I've just been popping up various cameras, aiming them,  so now there's, like, the Opie cam, the Jimmy cam, my cam, group cam,  you know, getting them all in that way.  What's the matter?  You don't like your belly?  Are you looking at your belly?  I think I have body dysmorphic disorder.  That's on one.  Let me see.  I can pop that up, and now everyone can see that.  Jimmy's standing there looking at his belly.  I don't have to move anything.  Why is Jimmy posing?  I'm trying to stand naturally. 
[04:06:00]  I look like I'm a panther.  Or maybe I'll aim the camera up.  I'll be Tom Likas.  Oh, yeah.  Here we go.  Okay.  Oh, Jesus.  Up.  I'm going to lose the moment.  Sorry.  I got Likas.  Twist.  Cam 3.  Oh, it's Cam 3.  Yep.  Motherfuck, dick.  And then up is down, because that's not Cam 3.  You had it, Ant.  I had it.  It's Cam 1.  All right, go.  I said Cam 1.  I'm just Jim again.  And there's Steve in another show. 
[04:06:30]  What the fuck, Steve?  Hey, fucking Zelig.  Fucking Steve shows up in every camera shot.  Well, there you go.  You look great.  Steve's like a big, dumb daisy.  I don't know how daisies fit in.  They're always in pictures.  You meant to say pansy? 
[04:07:00]  Jimmy loves the gay jokes for Steve.  I don't mean them.  I don't think Steve is gay.  Steve, you got anything?  Like I said, I don't think Steve is gay.  What?  Just for Tamara.  Cool.  I have a guest I have to pitch, my friend.  That's right, you do.  Who?  My buddy, Eric.  Who is he?  The guy I'd come up with.  And?  It'll be this week for XM4.  He's doing a gig on Saturday.  What?  I don't know.  Him and three other guys who are like four there. 
[04:07:30]  I don't know.  But it's in theater.  Somewhere.  Around.  Just keeping Steve in frame now.  No, you'll try to aim at Steve and it'll be on someone else.  He tries to move out of the way.  Let's zoom in on his ear.  Steve's trying to figure out how to get a foundry logo in there.  Can we watermark all the cameras?  I need a watermark.  That's right. 
[04:08:00]  Paris Hilton's cunty whining sponsored.  You could shave it into the back of your head.  There's an idea.  What?  You kind of look like Mike Piazza, yet you don't at all.  I know.  Not really.  Why are you sweating so much?  Because it's hot in here.  It's not that hot.  It's freezing in here.  Oh, you know what?  It's this new stuff I'm taking.  What, A-D-T?  I know exactly what's doing it, too.  Look at the sweat.  It's really not that hot in here. 
[04:08:30]  I think I think exactly what it is.  What are you taking?  Most of the guys have sweatshirts in here.  Yeah.  Stop with the supplements.  It's a new supplement.  It's making me free.  Stop.  What kind of supplement?  It makes your heart.  I don't even know if it makes your heart rate increase.  It's bleach and protein.  I just can't wait to get a load in my mouth.  So why do they say that?  You're not gay.  Go ahead.  No, I'm not gay.  I apologize.  No, it's just it's one of these new.  It's a protein supplement that for some reason it's like that.  It's one of those things.  It's not ephedrine because ephedrine is banned now.  So it's just got some kind of some herbal concoction. 
[04:09:00]  So you're going to explain to us what it's not?  Yeah, I'm going to explain to you what it's not.  But apparently it's making my freaking sweat glands go a little bit berserder.  Is it safe?  Yeah, it's fine.  Is it safe?  I don't do that many of them.  I used to take a lot more.  But what you wind up doing is you just, you know, put your adrenal gland into overdrive.  Now I do one of them.  That doesn't sound safe.  You're listening to him talk.  You are like, yeah, you're like fucking on speed.  You snorted off an album?  It's a crystal meth.  Not this one.  Dude, you are like a crystal meth guy right now.  No, I know you work out.  Work out, eat some egg whites, protein shake. 
[04:09:30]  That's all you need.  You don't need all that other shit.  I'm doing a lot less egg whites.  You see what Tarrotop looks like?  Dude, that's insane.  That's true.  You don't want to be like Tarrotop, do you?  You think that's roids?  There's got to be something.  Are you on roids?  No, I was for a while, but not for a little while.  Those fucking deltoid shots of him?  They explained.  What the fuck, dude?  That's fluid in there.  You inject yourself.  It's not necessarily that.  There could be any number of things, but when you inject yourself with any kind of substance, 
[04:10:00]  whether it's human growth hormone or steroids, and you overwork a muscle like that,  you'll see that muscle just get completely defined.  A lot of the competition bodybuilders that work out at my gym, you'll see that shoulder  muscle that'll puff out like that.  Tarrotop.  We call them pumpkin shoulders.  Yeah.  It's just you've...  I want to do that with just my right arm.  It could happen also because that's also a convenient place to inject is the shoulder.  Sometimes when they don't go other places, there'll be a concentration of the stuff there  and you'll be... 
[04:10:30]  Yeah.  Inject it in your cock if it's going to do that.  No shit.  Yeah, exactly.  How many hours a day are you a cock?  Listen to this.  An hour on weights and then like a half an hour on the cardio.  I thought it was more than that.  Well, it was, but then I had a new diet and new plan put together just because I plateaued  again and then I started gaining weight when I got off the diet.  So I got on a new plan.  How are you gaining weight if you got a small little stomach?  Or is that stretching out now?  It's stretching out.  It's like, it used to be the size of a golf ball.  Now it's probably the size of like a normal human stomach, but it was all food choices. 
[04:11:00]  So now it's less egg whites.  Well, yeah.  I have to piss.  Substantially less egg whites.  Jesus.  I have to piss.  All right.  I'm going to take it, Jimmy.  We'll leave.  I don't want to end the show.  I have to piss all day.  I just, you know, he's sweating really bad over here.  Well, it's just going to have light in my face like that, too.  Jimmy's got 30,000 watts of par cans or something.  Jimmy's got a hoodie on.  Well, Jimmy also weighs about 80 pounds less than I do.  I remember the stage lighting when Foundry played. 
[04:11:30]  Exactly.  When we would play the song, you may have heard of it, Pendulum.  Well, I also weighed 400 pounds back then.  So just moving from point A to point B was going to be bringing under a sweat.  He's sweating like Jack Black is introducing him to the eighth wonder of the world.  Yeah, but awful acting performance.  We can end the show here.  Yeah, let's do that.  We'll all go and piss, right?  Everyone.  Same urinal.  Bunch of cockheads fighting for power.  By the way, this is where the studio audience, like, applauds and stuff out of greatness.  Thank you. 
[04:12:00]  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  It's Opie and Anthony.  For the illiterate and ignorant, this is dangerous propaganda.  Opie and Anthony. </pre>
