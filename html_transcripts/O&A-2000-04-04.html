<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The April 4th, 2000, Opie and Anthony Show began with a discussion about the stock market crash, featuring a heated exchange with a caller, Steve, who criticized the hosts for complaining about their losses.  Opie and Anthony countered by detailing their own financial setbacks and mused about buying more stocks on margin.  The conversation then shifted to their recent WrestleMania trip to Los Angeles, detailing encounters with celebrities like Michael Clarke Duncan, Macaulay Culkin, Jermaine Jackson, Screech, Mo Vaughn, Martin Short, and French Stewart. They recounted their prime seating, the audience's reactions ("Wow" and "OK Terrific" signs), and their acquisition of WrestleMania chairs (one of which Sandy sold for $50). They also complained about the in-flight movies (*Anna and the King* and *Stuart Little*) and a crying baby on their flight home.

A major segment focused on their accidental breaking of the news about a surprise Stone Temple Pilots concert at Irving Plaza. They'd learned about it from bassist Rob DeLeo on their flight, beating another radio station that had been teasing the announcement for days. This led to numerous listener calls mocking the competing station.  The hosts then transitioned to discussing the station's new morning show, drawing parallels to their own initial negative reception and encouraging listeners to be supportive.  This segued into a discussion of former morning show host Stephen Suh's perceived decline in health, alongside reflections on their own experiences with management.

The stock market discussion resumed with a call from stockbroker Dave, offering a colorful account of the day's trading, interspersed with frequent, explicit homophobic slurs and jokes, often targeting studio guest Jay Moore, a day trader who also participated in the conversation. This segment also included several advertisements, including one for Joey Paisano's restaurant.  Further discussion of Moore's recent comedy show followed, including listener encounters, a negative interaction with Paisano, and more explicit sexual content and homophobic slurs targeting Moore, fueled by rumors about Kevin Spacey's sexuality.

A significant portion of the show was dominated by a volatile confrontation between Jay Moore and comedians Billy Hine and Paul Bond of Airsick Productions, sparked by accusations of Moore stealing jokes from other comedians like Otto and George, and Jeffrey Ross.  The argument, punctuated by insults, including homophobic slurs, and threats of violence, escalated to a near-physical altercation in the studio, requiring intervention from show staff, including producer Rick and Anthony's brother Joe, who disapproved of Moore's behavior.  The conflict remained unresolved, with the possibility of a continued confrontation outside the studio becoming a running joke.  The segment included mentions of the STP concert, a Vermont Teddy Bear commercial, and ticket giveaways.

This conflict further escalated in subsequent segments, with accusations of joke stealing, unequal airtime, and disrespect.  The shouting match, including the use of homophobic slurs and other insults directed at both Moore and Bond ("faggot," "two-faced little prick," "fat guy," "fat ass"), almost turned physical, spilling into the courtyard outside the studio, requiring multiple staff members to intervene and prevent a full-blown brawl. Jeff Norris, a guest, even received a punch to the ear during the melee.  The argument included accusations of dishonesty, references to past interactions, discussions of comedic originality, and speculation about the event being staged.  The show was briefly interrupted due to excessive profanity.  The segment included plugs for various shows, including Stone Temple Pilots and Corbett and Testa Verde, and listener calls reacting to the events, concluding with a contest for WWF tickets.  The show ended with continued discussion of the fight, and additional listener calls reacting to the events.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Some days, you know, for a laugh ride, and other days you just flat out suck, we know it.  Interesting, that's true.  Opie and Anthony.  027.  Opie and Anthony.  There's my coffee.  And this is going to be one of those days where we don't suck.  Way too much to do today on the Opie and Anthony show.  Ah, for this Tuesday, April 4th, 2000, Anthony.  Black Tuesday.  Black Tuesday upon us. 
[00:00:30]  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  What the hell is going on?  Ah.  But what happened?  I had money.  Well, Ann, what's the Dow doing now?  Why didn't I leave?  Why didn't I leave?  Why didn't I punch out when I had the chance?  You got greedy.  You got yourself greedy there. 
[00:01:00]  Why didn't I?  All right, if you want in on the show, 212-757-1027.  Steve, what's going on today, man?  What's up, man?  How you doing?  How are you?  So what about this crash?  It's unbelievable, huh?  I can't believe it.  But you know what?  I don't feel bad for you guys at all.  You guys got money up the wazoo.  Oh, really?  Yeah, you do.  You guys got a radio show.  You guys think you're all cool.  You guys lose money.  Big effing deal.  You guys are first-timers. 
[00:01:30]  Big deal.  What?  What are you talking about?  Why are you so bitter, my friend?  Yeah, why aren't we all in this together?  You know what?  I don't feel bad for rich people.  That's why.  Rich?  I would guarantee you have more money than me, Steve.  Probably.  You ass-wipe.  Listen, don't cry.  Everyone reads about how the big boy in town makes all this money doing a radio show  and assumes everyone else makes money.  And I do not make money to do this radio show, ass.  That doesn't happen.  You guys making a nice dollar more than I make. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, really?  Why don't you jump on the train with me in Huntington every day?  If I was making money, would I be taking a train every day and having people snoring  on my lap?  Rich people don't commute.  So rich people don't commute.  That's what you say.  That's because it's easier.  That's why.  Come on.  Give me a break.  I got money in sun, and I'm losing money, bro.  You want to see where I live?  You want to see where Ann lives?  We do not make any money, dickface.  Opie.  Opie.  Opie.  Opie.  Opie.  If I may.  If I may. 
[00:02:30]  If I may.  Obviously, Steve.  Let's hear it.  Let's hear it, Anthony.  Obviously, Steve is having a very bad day in the market.  It's very obvious.  He's losing tons and tons of his hard-earned cash.  I got a little money in sun.  I understand.  You guys got some money in the Nasdaq.  I understand that.  Some?  Steve, let me tell you something.  Half my so-called fortunes is in the market, and all of that is gone.  I lost just about all of it the last two days alone. 
[00:03:00]  It's over, Johnny.  It's over, Johnny.  All right.  This is a good thing for us.  You know what we can do?  We can call a margin, and we can buy even more stocks now, because everything's low.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Who has the balls to do that?  I do.  Let's do it.  Then you obviously have more money than us.  We'll call up our brokers.  We'll tell them, all right, we'll buy it.  Let's put $50,000 on margin and buy some more.  Oh, yeah.  Now, I'm just sweating here today.  Everyone margined up when they thought it hit a bottom last week.  Yeah, I know.  And what are you going to do, you know?  But, you know, it's a buy-in opportunity, I think. 
[00:03:30]  All right, Steve.  It's just time to buy.  All right, Steve.  Take all your money and shove it up your ass.  We've got a radio show to do today.  Thank you.  Douchebag.  Goodbye.  He obviously is losing money hand over fist.  He's a little angry.  Obviously, he hasn't been to any of the road shows.  He hasn't seen, you know, what we look like and how we dress.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  The debut of the stupid clip.  Wow, that was early in the show.  Stupid!  You're so stupid! 
[00:04:00]  I love that one.  You think, okay, terrific's good.  Okay, terrific.  That's old now.  We got stupid.  You're so stupid.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  Stupid!  Okay.  So, what's going on with the Dow, Anthony?  Let's get this out of the way, because we've got to talk about our trip to L.A., to WrestleMania.  Yes.  We have Jay Moore coming in. 
[00:04:30]  We do.  Oh, yeah.  We've got tons of things to do today on the show.  I believe my brother Joe's coming in, too.  With a couple of offensive songs.  Offensive songs.  I hear they're really, really good.  He calls me up last night.  I don't know.  It was about 11 o'clock.  Plays them for me over the phone.  I'm like, oh, my God.  These are great.  They're contenders.  They're going to be contenders.  Yeah.  Awesome.  Opie, the Dow down 145.  The NASDAQ down 167.  That might sound bad.  That's a huge comeback in the last hour. 
[00:05:00]  They are way off their lows of the day.  The NASDAQ at one point was like, I don't know, 500 points down.  It was a mess.  A total mess.  Blood bath.  Everyone's selling off.  Now, there's a little bit of a rebound, but I don't know if this will stick.  I'm buying Microsoft.  Microsoft.  Well, a lot of people.  It can't possibly go any lower.  Yeah.  The whole it can't possibly go lower thing.  How many people were saying that last week?  Get my broker on the phone. 
[00:05:30]  I'm going to buy Microsoft.  Microsoft.  Well, if you go to some of the.  I think I can afford 10 shares.  Yeah.  If you go to some of the hardcore trading message boards, like RagingBull.com is one of them.  People are freaking out, losing all their money, have no clue who to blame.  And it is just a pisser to read some of these.  People that.  I mean, on the message board, one guy writes, lost my savings and my children's education. 
[00:06:00]  Thank you, Alan Greenspan.  Like it's Greenspan's fault.  You put all your eggs in one bastard.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And other people saying, this is the end of the world as we know it.  And I feel fine.  Well, I don't know.  And I feel fine.  I don't know if they're feeling fine.  But some people really, really freaking out.  I got a theory.  Buy Microsoft.  It's got to go back up.  Microsoft.  Because if Microsoft crashes and goes bankrupt, then we're all effed. 
[00:06:30]  Well, Microsoft having a little problem there.  Of course, the Justice Department ruling against them, saying that they unlawfully tied their browser there,  that Explorer that everyone uses, to their Windows applications.  Right.  And I don't see how that's a bad thing.  You know what?  It's just the business.  It's business.  That's what they do.  They're saying that they're keeping competition out and they're monopolizing the thing.  They just have the system that everybody seems to use. 
[00:07:00]  Seems to like.  And enjoy.  And now they put their face in it and everyone ran scared.  Then they had that other bitch that downgraded all the, that pulled a lot of the tech stocks out of her portfolio.  That screwed things up.  Greenspan.  Always bitching about the market and inflation, raising interest rates.  And people are just looking at some of these stocks like they're overvalued.  So all of a sudden, you get a day like this.  A week like we've had.  NASDAQ taking the big dump. 
[00:07:30]  Remember everybody celebrating that NASDAQ 5000?  That was only last week.  Oh, my God.  A couple of weeks ago.  Not even.  I think that was like last Tuesday.  I think it was a week ago.  We were all celebrating.  You know what happens also?  You go to CNBC, turn it on every morning, and you see the guy from the NASDAQ site there on Wall Street.  Yeah.  On Times Square.  And he's always trying to find an up angle.  Always trying to find the positive thing.  NASDAQ, you know, down 200 points today.  But, you know, it's still up for the year more than 20%. 
[00:08:00]  We're looking really good.  He's always trying to get the positive spin.  Yeah.  I saw him today.  Oh, my God.  He like had a black eye and a bloody nose.  It's over, Johnny.  It's over.  Forget it.  Pull your money.  He could not find a positive spin.  It was just death and destruction today.  Some people must have made bukus of cash, though.  Some of these stocks have taken 40-point swings in a mere hour's time. 
[00:08:30]  You've got to be insane to play that.  You know what it is?  You've got to be mentally insane.  Well, that's the crapshoot, the roulette spin-of-the-wheel game.  Because you can't tell me you know what these things are doing.  But if you see a stock that took a 20-point dump, and now you're looking at it, and it's  five points up.  All within two hours.  Yeah.  All within two hours.  A couple of hours.  A couple of hours.  A couple of hours.  And now it's up five.  If someone's playing this right, God bless you.  We've got to get Stockbroker Dave on the phone. 
[00:09:00]  People asking me how the $600 that you gave me that I invested is doing.  Yeah.  It's worth about $40 right now.  Jesus.  Oh, well.  So much for getting my money back.  We've got to get Stockbroker Dave on the phone when the market closes.  Yeah.  Our man on the floor.  It's probably like Heart Attack Central down there today.  Unbelievable.  People just must be just losing their minds.  Let's go to Larry real fast.  Larry, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, man.  Listen, I just wanted to let you know, first of all, it was down $600. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It was like $600.  I saw it was five and change.  What, the NASDAQ or the Dow?  Oh, both.  NASDAQ was down like $600.  Yeah.  Both.  Also, the other thing is I wanted to pay my last respects to your $600.  It's done.  It's over, Johnny.  Punch out.  It's over.  I didn't know if I needed to coax one of you guys off of the window sill.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  Hey, what the hell are you going to do, you know?  Listen, take a look at People Magazine, your girl Brittany.  Yeah.  Let me tell you.  We'll check it out. 
[00:10:00]  She's a hot one, man.  All right, love it.  Did I get my free people that I didn't subscribe to in the mail?  Is it in today?  Probably not.  Hope you got this.  Opie, what CDs did you get sent today?  Dude, you know what I would do, man?  Why?  How about that?  She is.  Hey, man, if you guys are going to send us, like, free CDs and stuff, you know, at least pick good ones.  Make some good ones.  Then I'm going to do it with a Backstreet Boys CD.  Hope you got the Will Smith, the Backstreet Boys, Charlotte Church, Air Supply, Air Supply, 
[00:10:30]  and Garth Brooks as Chris Gaines.  Not even like Garth, so that if you even liked Garth, you would like it.  It's Garth Brooks as Chris Gaines.  Garth needed a tax write-off, I think.  All right.  You guys rock.  Thanks, man.  Thanks, Mike.  Take care.  Godspeed.  I don't know what.  It was funny when it was happening at the video.  I don't even care.  I throw it in the garbage. 
[00:11:00]  Throw it in the garbage.  Ronnie, what's going on?  How you doing, O.D.?  Great.  I was down at the Stern Show.  I tried putting a wow sign on their...  on their broadcast this morning.  And I had wow on it, and Casey started fighting with me over there,  and on the back it said, Opie and Anthony, take it in the rear real hard.  Oh, there you go.  Thank you, Ronnie.  Ronnie?  Oh, he hung up, Opie, because that was the end of his little joke.  He was the take it in the rear guy. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  I get it.  Boy, he got us.  All right, now let's take a break.  We've got to get into our trip to and from L.A.  Yep.  Does this sound familiar, Anthony?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[00:12:00]  Jesus Christ.  Well, we'll get into that story next.  Stay there.  Opie, Anthony.  Opie, Anthony.  1-0-7-W-A-W.  That's right.  We're back.  It's two for twos.  Oh.  What?  That's right.  We've got a new radio station finally.  That old gag.  I think we finally have a full lineup in place, Anthony.  Do we?  A complete lineup for the first time since you and I took this job two years ago.  You mean something that they're actually going to stick with? 
[00:12:30]  They're going to attempt to stick with the current lineup, yes.  How about that?  How about that is right.  There was so much excitement around this place today.  It was amazing.  There's actually people in the hallways that want to work and win.  Stop.  I swear to you.  You see, I'm running around like crazy today?  I know.  It does look like there's something going on today.  There's like four or five new shows here.  They all have their own offices.  They're running around like crazy.  I don't get it.  It's very, very good.  Yeah.  Right? 
[00:13:00]  I'm very happy about it.  I mean, it's quite the contrast from when we first got here.  That's for sure.  The one thing I can say about the new shows is they're all going to give it their best shot to succeed.  Yeah.  Unlike many of the past shows we had here at N.E.W.  Yeah.  So we'll see what happens.  I don't know.  Is there anybody left to blame?  No.  Everyone's gone.  Yeah.  I guess that's it.  Everyone's gone.  There's no one left to blame from the old regime.  So if something happens, it's your own fault. 
[00:13:30]  Let's put it this way.  There are only three guys that have been working here longer than you and I.  Yeah.  Three.  Right.  I have a staff of at least 40 or 50.  Wait, wait, wait.  You did say working.  Oh.  There's only two that have been working here longer.  There's one that's been here longer than I.  I don't know.  That's wild.  That's wild for a radio station that had guys that pretty much died in these seats.  Yeah. 
[00:14:00]  And then they kept them on the air.  And then they kept them on the air anyway.  I don't know what it was.  The sound of the flies buzzing over their dead carcass of the show.  What a turn this station has taken.  It was funny because the old regime, the old players, the old jocks.  Yeah.  They would sit around, you know, outside the studio and stuff and brag how long they were here.  And that's all that mattered, not how good they sounded on the air, but how long they occupied the seats on air.  I was here 20 years.  20 years here at NEW. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, yeah.  That's nothing.  I've been here for 35 years.  I was here for 50 years.  And they looked down at the people that were only here for like 15?  Yeah.  Like you've only been here 15 years.  You're still a rookie.  I've been here 30.  And the only way you'd get thrown out the door is if you didn't have seniority.  Yeah.  It had nothing to do with, like, that was the funniest thing.  It had nothing to do with your ratings or your show or if you had any energy or if you wanted to succeed.  It was how long your ass was making a dent in one of these chairs. 
[00:15:00]  That was it.  Wonderful.  So now we have a brand new lineup.  Why is that even on the list?  What?  Why is me in shorts anything to do?  Like Rick just put up a thing of maybe some thought starters from our trip to L.A.  And the top of the list, the first thing, WWF Weekend Notes.  Yeah.  Ant in shorts.  Ant in shorts.  Gee, call me a lunatic. 
[00:15:30]  It's 85 degrees in L.A. and I put on a pair of shorts.  Whoa.  Whoa.  I'm a madman.  Ant.  That was the first time anyone has seen you in shorts, though, Ant.  That's all the Turks and Caicos.  I was in shorts here with Opie.  You were there.  I've seen you in shorts before, but the rest of the staff here has never seen you in shorts.  That's all.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  I don't want to show you I have a wooden leg.  That's what it is.  I'm scared of my wooden leg.  I didn't think that was newsworthy.  All right.  I'm wearing shorts. 
[00:16:00]  Wow.  How about that?  All right.  We could waste 20 minutes on that, I believe, knowing us.  It's not like your bicycle pants.  It's not as funny as that.  I'm just wearing shorts.  That's when I'm mountain biking.  I'm not one of the guys that walks around in bicycle pants.  All right.  No, I'm not.  You see those guys on the streets all the time.  They have the problem.  I'm insane.  They're actually made for, if you're doing some, you know, rugged mountain biking, not  to walk around during lunchtime.  Call it rugged mountain biking.  Shut up. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, I'm the crazy guy.  I'm wearing shorts.  I'm laying on the beach.  I'm on Laguna Beach.  I'm laying on the beach in shorts.  I look up at the boardwalk.  I see Opie dressed like he's in Alaska.  Dude, I was so freaking tired when we boarded that plane on Saturday morning.  I just figured it was still winter wherever we were going.  But I had no short.  I'll tell you.  I had no short sleeve shirts.  No.  I had no.  I didn't bring any shorts.  I did end up bringing my Tevas.  That was about it.  It was so hot on the beach. 
[00:17:00]  You're 100% right.  I look at the boardwalk.  There's Opie and Sandy walking down like they're going on an Alaskan cruise.  You are 100% right.  I'm like, what the hell?  But that's not on the list.  No.  Ant in shorts is on the list.  I didn't see that.  Did you drive your rented car to the beach?  Yeah.  Was it a cabrio?  No.  Shut up.  What? 
[00:17:30]  I didn't rent a cabrio.  Oh, no?  No.  All right.  I don't even know what I had.  What color are the speedometer lights on that cabrio?  Dude, trust me.  I don't like the...  I don't like the fact that the other day I passed my one.  It's the gayest shade of purple you'll ever see.  That's why I don't...  I officially don't drive anymore because now I can't even handle just driving around the neighborhood.  You're right.  You're 100% right.  What am I going to say?  Am I going to try to defend the fact that I had to drive a cabrio for a while? 
[00:18:00]  You're 100% right.  I'm now pretty much homeless.  I have to take the bus because I refuse to get in that damn thing.  I'm homeless.  I'm like that guy walking down the street.  You're convinced he's homeless because he doesn't have a car.  I don't have a car.  I officially do not have a car.  You are right.  All right.  It's purple.  It has like the lavender lights inside.  The lights inside is like, oh my God.  It's like the cockpit of Fag Airlines.  You are completely correct, my friend. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  I need an SUV.  I got to start test driving these mother effers this weekend.  I can't believe you got our agent to pay for your frigging car.  Why?  I'm amazed by you.  I'm just stunned.  Dude, you got to work.  That's amazing.  You know how much money he makes off us?  I know.  That's why we're poor.  Oh, we're poor.  So we fly out to Anaheim, California. 
[00:19:00]  Thank you to the WWF right off the bat.  Wow.  Treat us like superstars.  Yes.  Limos and hotels and champagne and all this crap.  It was great.  It was a great, great time.  Very cool.  But let me tell you something.  There is nothing to do in Anaheim unless you want to go to Disneyland.  Yeah.  Or there's a Disney World out there.  I always get them confused.  I knew they were going to send a car for us, but I opted to rent a vehicle, not from our  agent either.  No, I had to.  I knew. 
[00:19:30]  You know, you go to Anaheim, you're in the hotel.  Right.  Like you said, Disneyland, not even Disney World.  Right.  Disneyland.  There is nothing.  Gee, it must have been a blast in the 50s.  There's just nothing to do in Anaheim.  No.  So, yeah, I decided I'm going to go up to Santa Monica and see our agent.  We gave him enough money.  It would be nice to say hi to him.  Try to scam my car off of me.  I was bummed.  Because, like, oh, that's why I rented it.  I'm going out. 
[00:20:00]  Well, I was, well, the story goes that we realized there was nothing to do in Anaheim.  Yeah.  So, I'm like, I got to get the hell out of here.  So, I wanted to go up to Santa Monica, which was a good hour away.  Yeah.  Close to, anyway.  And I went up there to meet the agent so he could wheel and deal.  Wheel and deal.  And he wanted me to take a cab.  Whoa.  It was like an $80 cab ride.  One way.  You could rent a car.  Yes.  So, then I started calling places.  No one had a car.  And then you came into the lobby. 
[00:20:30]  I'm like, I was hinting, like, dude, give me your freaking car.  I got to get the hell out of here.  It's like, what do you think I'm going to do, hang out in the hotel?  Yeah.  No.  So, I ended up getting a car and we went up to Santa Monica, so.  And we had a great, great time.  And then the agent, like, as I'm leaving, he gives me a check for the rental.  What a guy.  On top of, like, you know, a free dinner.  Unbelievable.  He's still way ahead of the game.  Trust me.  Oh, I know.  Tell me about it.  Trust me.  He's way ahead of the game. 
[00:21:00]  So.  You want to talk about wrestling and all that, Ant?  Well, we did have a good time, didn't we?  Mm-hmm.  I definitely liked the ladder match.  It was great.  Mm-hmm.  The whole WrestleMania, I think they did a good job this year.  The cat fighting was the best.  Yeah.  But we get to our seats.  We were in the fourth row.  Fourth freaking row.  Right on the floor, right next to the ring.  Right next to the ring.  In the section with the beautiful people up here.  Yeah, we were in the beautiful people section. 
[00:21:30]  It's like, what is Vince crazy?  You put us in with the beautiful people.  It was hilarious.  Right.  What amounted to, let's see, there was the black guy from that movie, The Green Mile.  Yeah, Michael, whatever his name is.  Yeah.  From The Green Mile.  He was like a couple of.  He was in the front row.  Yeah, the front row.  He was 15 feet away from us tops.  He must have made it onto the broadcast, I'm assuming.  Yeah.  Because he was jumping up and down.  He was really, really into it.  He went after Triple H at the end of the show.  I don't know if that was still on the pay-per-view part of it,  but he jumped over the barrier and started trying to attack Triple H. 
[00:22:00]  Triple H is just saying, F you, man.  Come on, get some F you.  Yeah, that was pretty funny.  And then, let's see, I saw Macaulay Culkin.  You saw Macaulay Culkin?  Yeah.  You didn't tell me that.  He was way to the left of us.  Okay.  Yeah, he was there.  All right.  And then.  Well, the guy right behind you was pretty famous.  Ah, we had Jermaine Jackson.  Jermaine Jackson.  Jermaine.  Right behind us.  Yeah.  With a bunch of little kids.  And I'm just looking like, oh, man, what's this about?  And right in front of us was Flip Wilson's grandson. 
[00:22:30]  Uh-huh.  Who was there.  He wouldn't stop yelling and making noise.  And right ahead.  You were making Screech laugh a lot.  Oh, Screech from Saved by the Bell was right in front of us.  You were cracking him up big time.  Yeah, we were having a piss there.  And then Mo Vaughn was right there in front of us.  Yeah.  And then I forgot his name, Torrey something from the L.A. Rams.  And then French Stewart was two rows ahead of me.  Martin Short.  Martin Short was right there.  All in the section.  Two rows in front of us, yeah. 
[00:23:00]  And then we look across the ring, and the first sign we see, dead center.  You guys must have saw it if you ran a pay-per-view.  It said, wow, Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  I'm like, oh, my God.  Yeah, we're in California.  We're in California.  This is an MS, you know, Madison Square Garden.  They don't even get us out here.  And then I'm looking at Jim Ross and the King broadcasting, and there's guys sitting right  behind him that had a sign that just said, O&A, where are you?  Yeah.  We got their attention.  That was a lot of fun.  And then the OK Terrific signs. 
[00:23:30]  OK Terrific guy, yeah.  And wow signs all over the damn place.  It was huge.  It turned out, I guess, a lot of the people came from New York, obviously.  They had some packages or whatever.  And we got to take our seats home, Anthony.  Yes, that was another thing.  You haven't had fun, so you have to check folding chairs into baggage.  Mm-hmm.  You got yours, though?  Yeah.  You brought yours back?  Well, first of all, Keith from Manhattan, Green Mile guy, Michael Clark Duncan.  Thank you. 
[00:24:00]  He's Green Mile guy.  He is freaking huge.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  So after the WrestleMania, they come up and they say, hey, everyone gets to take their  seats home, which was kind of awkward.  We walked out of the Anaheim, I don't even know what it's called.  The Pond.  The Pond.  That's right.  Commemorative chair.  Sandy sold hers right off the bat.  I hope the WWF isn't listening.  But a guy in a limo rolls down the window and goes, 50 bucks for the chair.  Sand made that deal immediately.  Limited edition.  Well, they were. 
[00:24:30]  They had the cushions on them and the bat cushion were commemorative World Wrestling  Federation, WrestleMania 2000, all over it and stuff.  The colors of the event on it and everything.  My voice is still shot.  But, yeah, so collector's items.  And Sandy sold it, huh?  50 bucks.  50 bucks.  I think she could have got more, but it was worth it because she had no desire to walk  around with that damn thing.  Nah.  I checked eBay last night when we got home.  Yeah.  They're going for 200 bucks already.  Are they?  Yep.  Auctioning them off. 
[00:25:00]  Yep.  200 bucks.  200 bucks.  This is serious.  This is holding chair, people.  This is serious memorabilia.  Holding chair, people.  I don't know.  The WWF isn't thinking, though.  Why?  To allow all their fans to walk away with a chair after seeing the brutality that was  WrestleMania.  Yeah, yeah, I know.  I was waiting in the parking lot for some chair shots over the head.  I was waiting for that, too.  Well, that was the preferred seating section, Opie, so I don't think the beautiful people  outside would be smashing each other in the chair. 
[00:25:30]  I don't know.  They gave out a lot of chairs.  All the floor seats.  Had to be at least two.  Oh, all the floor seats?  Yeah.  That had to be at least 500, then.  I was going to say a couple hundred.  At least 500.  You were funny when we were leaving.  I was like, I think this is just their way to get us to clean up.  So they don't have to hire anybody to take the chairs.  Well, think about it.  You know?  Pay the union guys to clean up the floor seats.  The audience does it for you.  Yeah, screw it.  Let the audience, you know, take them home.  That was good, though.  Like I said, the ladder match, I think, was the highlight. 
[00:26:00]  Spectacular.  Yeah, the main event, eh.  Wait, I've got to tell you something about that ladder match.  Yeah.  While that was all going on, I started looking at the announce table.  Yeah.  And guaranteed, no cameras on the announce guys.  And the ring guy, I forget his name, Finkel or whatever his name is.  I was looking at him especially.  No cameras around.  No reason for anyone else in the whole place to look at, you know, Finkel.  But I was curious, you know?  Yeah.  Because the action was getting just way out of hand.  And I was looking at his face, and he was not faking it. 
[00:26:30]  He was just like, I cannot believe these guys are doing this.  I know.  Amazing.  I mean, if a camera was on him and, you know, he's working it for the audience, sure.  But there was no reason for this guy to react like he did, and he still was.  And he was talking to the other guy like, I can't believe he just did that.  They were doing flips off of the top of a ladder, landing on each other, falling off the ladder,  over the ropes, onto the floor, outside the ring, from heights that you just don't see.  Right.  You know, this was a great match.  Yeah. 
[00:27:00]  A lot of fun to watch.  Mike from Rockland, you guys should watch the encore tonight.  You might have made it on TV because they showed Screech and Torrey Holt, that's his name, on TV.  And the Green Mile guy going after Triple H also made it on.  That was, that was, that was, all those people were right around us.  We were right behind Screech.  Like, right behind him.  Mm-hmm.  And Kat's sister, that chick.  That was the blonde with the ponytail that was sitting next to Screech.  Who's Kat's sister?  Kat from the.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, very cool.  Which is kind of funny because when, at one point, when, who fell on top of the announce table at one point? 
[00:27:30]  I think it was Mankind or, that smashed the table.  Yeah.  And King and J.R. are like, oh my God, there goes our table.  Right.  Well, at that point, my girlfriend goes, hey, I wonder if the cat, I wonder if her head got hurt when that table fell.  Making a little joke that she was under the table for the king. 
[00:28:00]  Taking care of the king.  Yeah, she, you know, the cat goes, goes out with the king.  Oh, that's what we've heard, yes.  And the chick turns around and goes, what?  It goes, I'm the cat's sister.  Us.  Little Joe.  That's a little Joe.  That was a little Joe.  Yeah.  Yeah, she was cool about it.  That's very cool.  Some of the signs that are up there.  I mean, come on.  What, are you going to be all tender and stuff?  Did you see all the old-time wrestlers in our hotel?  Did you recognize any of those guys?  No.  Oh, my God.  I saw Shawn Michaels. 
[00:28:30]  Shawn Michaels was there.  And Triple H eating with a big bodyguard next to him, so no one bugged him.  Let me tell you something, Triple H is a dick.  He really is.  What do you mean?  Well, Rick saw him flat out tell a little kid that he wasn't signing autographs.  No, he didn't even talk to a little kid.  It was one kid in front of the hotel.  Rick.  What?  That little kid was you, wasn't it?  All right, I was all by myself.  Yeah.  It was just one kid who recognized him because he was leaving pretty quick.  One kid.  One kid. 
[00:29:00]  One kid.  Not like thousands.  This is Triple H.  And he's taking off his jacket, doesn't look at the kid, you know, throws the jacket to  the guy who's, like, watching the door.  Right, right.  Huge bodyguard.  Big bodyguard comes running over going, he's not doing any autographs.  Oh.  It's not like they're a 6'6", 700, 700.  Right, right.  Yeah, you just happen to see them.  It wasn't like the Beatles where they're running down the street.  It was one little tiny kid.  One kid.  With his swanny little legs.  He had his little shorts on.  All he had to do was say, hey, you know, I'm in a row, thanks for being a fan. 
[00:29:30]  Right.  That's all he had to say.  It was just a load of the kid.  Just bony little knees and stuff sitting there with his pen.  Can I have an autograph, please?  His pen is, you know, too big for his hand and his little pad.  He just wants an autograph from his hero.  Right.  Poor kid.  He didn't even ask for an autograph.  He just wanted to say hi to him.  Oh, my God.  So we saw that happen.  It was painful.  Oh, that's terrible.  But we had a great time.  But in our hotel, Anthony, one of my favorites of all time, Ernie Ladd, the cat.  Oh, yeah? 
[00:30:00]  He was there?  He's freaking huge.  If you remember Ernie Ladd, he used to have the injury where his thumb was all screwed up  and he used his thumb to, you know, gouge the eyes of his opponent.  And the big controversy was that he had this bad thumb for pretty much his whole wrestling career.  The injury never healed and he used it to his advantage.  He used it as a weapon.  He was in our hotel.  Also, do you remember Hillbilly Jim from the early 80s?  Hillbilly Jim.  From the Cyndi Lauper era, basically. 
[00:30:30]  From the first few.  I thought that was Hacksaw Jim Duggan.  No, Hacksaw Jim Duggan was the one with the two-by-four.  I don't remember.  He had the little Hillbilly hat on and overalls.  I think he even wrestled barefooted or something.  Oh, yeah?  He was in our hotel.  And then I saw Classy Freddie Blassie.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, oh.  What's the matter?  Death Watch.  Death Watch.  Really? 
[00:31:00]  And he had this Asian woman with him that couldn't have been more than 45 tops.  Yeah.  And he was introducing her to everyone as his wife.  I'm like, whoa.  Because he's got to be pushing 80.  Yeah.  So, hmm.  But it was a lot of fun.  And we enjoyed ourselves.  Yeah, what a time.  The flight in.  The flight in to L.A., we got Alex Trebek.  You kind of feel good when you have Alex Trebek on the plane because it's like, oh, a plane can't crash. 
[00:31:30]  Alex Trebek's on it.  Yeah, because you can't imagine reading that headline the next time Alex Trebek dies and tries a plane accident.  Yeah, yeah.  So you feel, you're right.  You feel really sick.  You feel good about that because it's like, well, Alex Trebek's on the plane.  It can't go down, you know.  You know, I'm pissed off because I know his wife and I forgot all about this.  She's from your neck of the woods.  She went to Harborfield High School.  She's a year younger than me.  She went to school with my brother.  She's got to be at least 20, 25, 20, wow, at least 20 years younger than Alex. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  And I want to say hi.  Oh, you didn't phrase that in the form of a question.  I'm sorry.  And she went to my high school.  She was on my school bus.  I was really good friends with her brother.  Yes.  And she lived right down the street from my parents.  You should have said hi.  It would have been great because everyone's walking by Alex saying, hi, Alex, love the show, that crap.  And I wanted to go, hey, Jeannie, what's up?  It would have freaked her out.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Stay away from my girl. 
[00:32:30]  Right.  But the flight out to LA blew.  Yeah.  For one reason.  You're looking forward to that damn movie to help you out.  Son of a bitch.  Oh, my God.  What?  What are they, crazy?  Who do they think is flying?  Oh, my God.  Chick flick at 30,000 feet.  It was painful.  We were trapped, doomed, with...  Anna and the King.  Anna and the King was the movie out to LA. 
[00:33:00]  Anna and the King.  What's the way back?  Well, I know.  Yeah.  We'll get to the way back in a second.  Anna and the King.  Anna and the King.  I'm like, oh, there's two hours I'm going to have to waste.  Uh, uh, total chick flick.  I looked around the plane.  There were no chicks on the plane.  No.  There was maybe like 12.  And not even a decent girl in the movie to look at.  Oh, Jody Foster.  They only, they almost made up for it, because right after that, they had a really good Honeymooners  episode. 
[00:33:30]  I love that.  That was making me laugh, but that was only, what, 20, 25 minutes.  I'm like, oh.  Grandma's delicious mystery appetizer.  Right.  Grandma's mystery, delicious mystery appetizer.  You go to any supermarket, what do you see?  The shelves are full of appetizers.  Great episode.  And then, uh, and then on the way back last night, we thought Anna and the King was bad. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, my God.  I thought maybe they'd redeem themselves.  Okay, chick flick on the way in, and when you go back, action film.  Action film.  Sure.  I was looking forward to the film.  What are we ghetto?  Stuart Little.  Stuart Little!  A kid flick.  A kid movie.  Chick flick, and then kid movie.  Do they think these things out?  I don't think so.  Look, we understand they have to fit a certain criteria.  You're not going to play Passenger 57 on the airplane.  I understand. 
[00:34:30]  You know, we're not going to see reruns of Airport 79 or something.  Crash footage from the FAA, which would be fun to watch, but, you know.  Stuart Little.  Stuart Little.  So you look around the plane, you're like, well, obviously this is a flight filled with  kids from Disneyland.  No.  There was one child.  There was one child that was right behind Anthony.  You know.  I was praying that we would go down at that point. 
[00:35:00]  That could be the most annoying sound when you're 35,000 feet in the air.  I'm convinced of it. 
[00:35:30]  It wouldn't stop.  The kid must have cried for at least half the flight.  He didn't friggin' stop.  Oh, I'm just going to be friggin' flashbacks.  You know something?  I was saying it earlier.  They should have sections of the airplane like they do on a ship.  On a cruise ship.  Now, obviously, not everyone can afford first class.  We couldn't.  We got the coach.  Right.  But there should be sub-coach.  Yeah.  And all children should have to fly with their parents in sub-coach, which is just a section 
[00:36:00]  of the plane full of screaming kids and anyone who decides they want to be with those screaming  kids.  Because you know something?  I made a decision not to have children for that reason.  So I could travel on a plane or anywhere I want without this.  Right.  And what do I get?  Right behind me.  Exactly behind me.  Screaming kid. 
[00:36:30]  Not only the screaming, but his mother's trying to hold him and he's kicking.  And what is he kicking, Opie?  The back of my seat.  So I'm feeling the back of my seat go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, just getting punched  and kicked by an infant screaming in my ear.  So then I have to turn Stuart Little up louder and louder in my ears.  It was a nightmare.  They should have steerage.  They should have a compartment on the plane that looks like when they brought the slaves 
[00:37:00]  over, where they're just laying down side by side.  But children are in the lowest section of the airplane that they could possibly be in.  Oh, man.  I didn't decide to sit near a child.  I didn't have a child.  I didn't bring a child onto a plane so it can annoy a plane load of people.  Why isn't there a section of an airplane that is for people with children?  That's it?  The annoying, frigging, whining child section of the plane. 
[00:37:30]  Put it in the nose somewhere with the radar array.  Should have put the kid next to the old Jews that were complaining the whole time.  Oh, my God.  You guys noticed that?  Nothing was good enough for that.  Nothing good enough.  They bring out their special kosher meal.  They go, hey, what is this?  It's not good enough.  Why do I have an aisle?  I wanted a window seat.  What is wrong with you?  Yes, I believe.  I wanted to stand up and just make an announcement to the whole plane. 
[00:38:00]  I hate you all.  Thank you.  Oh, the whole plane.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Oh, yeah.  You just realize why you hate human nature when you're stuck in a plane for six hours.  And when that kid started wailing, everyone's looking at me.  Everyone was looking at me.  Rick looked over at me.  Not looking at the kids at this point.  Everyone in the center aisle was looking at me like, oh, my God, this poor son of a bitch.  And you know who the poor son of a bitch was?  Me.  Well, your girlfriend is young. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, well.  She wouldn't shut up.  Wouldn't friggin' shut up.  I started humming baby wafer.  I wanted to hope they were a fan of the show and get it real fast.  I'm thinking if I take a small, a heavy object to her window, the cabin will depressurize  and the kid will get sucked right out like a holiday ham. 
[00:39:00]  I'll buckle in.  Like Goldfinger.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  We forgot to mention who was on our plane on the way back.  On the way back, yeah.  That was cool seeing him.  It was very cool.  A real celebrity.  Rock guy.  To see Rob DeLeo from STP.  Yeah.  Coming in town to do some things.  First class.  He was in the middle of first class.  He was right in the Captain Kirk chair of first class.  You see that?  There's one chair in first class.  Like, oh, the chairs in first class are great. 
[00:39:30]  I guess they need ample room for the hookers they send in for you to give you hummers while  you're drinking champagne.  Yeah, but you know what?  That kid was so loud, it didn't matter what class you were in.  Yeah, I know.  Rob DeLeo of STP heard exactly what we heard.  Had to deal with that.  Back in coach.  But there's all the...  A screaming baby.  There's the cushy chairs in first class down the windows.  And then instead of an aisle where there's a bunch of chairs, there's like one chair.  It's Captain Kirk's chair.  I'm at the con.  And he's looking at the...  Instead of looking at Stuart Little, you know, you see stars. 
[00:40:00]  A field of stars.  Look, we're coming up on Rhygol 7.  I can't believe it.  It's Captain Kirk's chair.  He was sitting in Captain Kirk's chair.  Yeah, and the huge movie screen's right in front of you.  It's too bad that it was Stuart Little.  He had to deal with Stuart Little, too.  We're backing up.  It's like...  Can't they put another movie in first class?  Oh, it's porno, Opie.  I think they get their choice of movies.  It's porno.  They get to watch porno.  Oh, and the stars are there to fluff them.  The fluff girls are there.  Man.  Mr. Zulu, take us out of here.  What's that good one? 
[00:40:30]  But it was Captain Kirk's chair.  I told Rob I was a huge fan.  Yeah.  I mean, this new STP CD is very, very underrated.  Number four.  There's some great tracks on this damn thing.  When are they coming to town?  Well, Anthony, I guess there's a certain radio station teasing an appearance by STP.  I guess they spent the whole weekend teasing the fact that there's going to be a surprise show by the Stone Temple pilots tomorrow.  He told us.  And a big-time radio announcer is going to be announcing this show tomorrow morning. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  Well, we might as well break it right here.  He told us.  He did.  So you could call up that station and say, why did you waste the whole weekend, you know, teasing the fact that the Stone Temple pilots are playing Irving Plaza tomorrow night.  Right from the band's mouth.  What?  Stone Temple pilots, Irving Plaza tomorrow night.  That's the big announcement that a certain radio station wasted the whole weekend teasing. 
[00:41:30]  And it still hasn't been announced by them officially.  So you could call them up and tease them.  Where?  And tell them that they're a bunch of losers for wasting our time.  If you guys ever want any info, you just call up the show.  We'll tell you.  If your pal's ONA, we don't need to tease stuff for like three or four days.  We get it right from the band's mouth.  That's right.  On the flight back from L.A.  Oh, I believe some people are pissed now.  Boy, what are the odds we'll be on the plane with the guy?  Isn't that funny?  We're on the plane with the guy. 
[00:42:00]  With Rob.  The bass player of the Stone Temple pilots.  Irving Plaza tomorrow night.  Irving Plaza tomorrow night.  Stone Temple pilots.  That's the big announcement you've been waiting days for.  They're going to be so pissed again.  Right from the bass player's mouth.  Hey, they didn't know who we were flying with.  Call them up.  They should have a pretty good reaction when you tell them that the Stone Temple pilots are playing Irving Plaza tomorrow night. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, my God.  Ouch.  Some tickets available.  You might want to call Irving Plaza to see if you can get yourself a ticket before they announce it tomorrow.  Where's Alex Trebek playing?  Cool.  Irving Plaza, huh?  This can be as funny as the time we heard Jackie announce where the birthday party was going to be. 
[00:43:00]  Why are we always, we are always within earshot of secrets.  Of big announcements.  Yeah.  And it's right from the people.  Right from the horse's mouth.  Like, we never would have known this if the bass player of Stone Temple Pilots wasn't on the plane with us.  So I come back and I tell a bunch of people, you know, I saw Rob DeLeo on the plane and stuff.  And a bunch of people are saying, you know, that's like the big announcement that a certain station is doing tomorrow.  Oh, really? 
[00:43:30]  Well, we found out last night.  Wasn't that big an announcement on the plane.  Uh, Frank, what's going on?  Hello?  Hey, Frank, what's up?  Yeah, dude, thanks so much for announcing that show.  No problem, man.  Because those bastards at K-Rock, they'll try to get you to do anything to listen to them.  You know?  A bunch of screwballs.  They'll tease things for days. 
[00:44:00]  If you guys need anything, you just, you know, give us a call.  We'll tell you what's going on.  Yeah.  Simple as that.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Frank.  All right.  Thanks a lot.  Stone Temple Pilots playing Irving Plaza tomorrow night.  Who told you what Gorilla Radio was?  With Kyle Zopi and Anthony.  That's right.  Looks like they don't have any show to do over there today.  Ouch.  What else are they going to do?  They were going to just tease that announcement for the next 12 hours.  What a stroke of luck. 
[00:44:30]  What a stroke of luck that Rob DeLand was on our plane.  On our plane.  On the way back.  DeLand.  Who saw that coming?  Hey, Matt, what's up?  Dude, the minute you guys go off on Friday, I switch to K-Rock.  The whole weekend.  Don't tell Violet.  Secret, secret, secret.  I just got off work.  I flip on 92 K-Rock.  I hear, oh, blah, blah, blah.  How was it tomorrow morning?  I flip on you guys for the long ride home back to the island, and all of a sudden I hear,  Irving Plaza.  I'm like, no way.  That is so rude.  That is so rude. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, man.  I can't wait.  I cannot wait to listen tomorrow to Howard.  I can't stand it, but I'm going to listen to him and see if anybody calls in and tells  him that you guys are now.  That's awesome.  That is awesome.  I don't think it's fair to, like, you know, tease your listeners for three or four days.  It's a simple concert announcement.  Stone Temple Pilots, Irving Plaza tomorrow night.  They've been building us up so much.  They're giving away free tickets, and you've got to call, like, 305 or whatever, blah, blah,  blah, blah, the free thing, and you guys just totally nailed them to the board, dude. 
[00:45:30]  I am so happy.  Thank you.  Hey, Matt, who's your concert leader?  What's that?  Oh, my God.  I'm sorry, man.  That's just great.  Hey, what station is your concert leader, Matt?  Oh, 1027.  I'm not even listening to K-Rock anymore.  True.  That is awesome.  Thank you, guys.  You made my day, man.  There you go.  Take care.  Now there's definitely no reason to listen to them today.  Opie and Anthony welcoming Stone Temple Pilots to Irving Plaza. 
[00:46:00]  What is it?  Oh, hey, come on, tomorrow night.  Thank you, Rob DeLeo.  You know, it just falls in our laps like that.  I don't know what happens, you know?  Jesus.  People like us too much.  They tell us this stuff.  What can I tell you, man?  Don't be pissed at us.  Jay, what's going on?  Yo, man, I got through to K-Rock.  I don't know who I talked to, but they're obviously not fans of yours, man. 
[00:46:30]  They shoot you guys out.  Called you a-holes, and they're going to, oh, God, man, just going off on you guys.  Yes, yes, yes.  How'd you guys see the guy on the plane?  He was there in first class.  First class.  I told him how great his new album is.  Hey, you know, we announced.  Thank you, buddy.  We announced the Stone Temple Pilots show, and if we're going to be the concert leader,  we should play a track from the STPCA.  Sure.  Why not, man?  Let's go.  All right.  We played it earlier, but I want to play it again because it is a great track off number 
[00:47:00]  four.  Yeah, you'll be hearing this one tomorrow night at Irving Plaza as Stone Temple Pilots take  the stage.  Oh, my God.  Opie and Anthony, your concert leader.  Your concert leader.  Got a track from number four.  It's the Stone Temple Pilots with our pal, Rob DeLeo.  Tells us everything we need to know.  A song called Sour Girl.  Of course, STP playing Irving Plaza tomorrow night.  Oh, my God.  Big difference.  We don't tease our audience for three or four days. 
[00:47:30]  Screw that, man.  Check out Sour Girl.  We'll take a quick break.  Call up Irving Plaza to see if you can get tickets for STP tomorrow night.  Only a few available.  It's WNEW, Sour Girl, STP.  Ah, yes, this is Gorilla Radio.  Gorilla Radio.  Another track from the Stone Temple Pilots CD number four.  That's Sour Girl.  Just announced here about ten minutes ago, Anthony, Stone Temple Pilots playing a surprise 
[00:48:00]  show tomorrow night at Irving Plaza.  Yeah.  Oh, ha, ha, ha, yes.  The other radio station's going to wait another, I don't know, 14 to 15 hours to tell you that  fact.  We were on the plane with the bass player, STP.  Rob, Rob.  Yeah, Rob told us.  Rob told us.  Rob told us.  So we're telling our listeners because we like you.  That's right.  Why not, man?  We don't need to tease things for three or four days and try to get you guys to listen. 
[00:48:30]  That's right.  Hey.  You would, you, you, Scotcha would have, uh, told everybody.  Okay.  Uh, Jeff, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Real good.  All right.  Uh, yeah, I was at, uh, K-Rock was doing a thing where they give away gas last week.  Yeah.  Did I stop by?  Yeah.  And they were giving away stuff, and the guy's like, well, you don't like Opie and Anthony now, do you? 
[00:49:00]  And I walk up to him, and I'm like, can I...  Yeah, we are a-holes.  We're a-holes.  They go, yeah, they're a-holes.  I think we all could agree on that point, that we are a-holes.  That's okay.  I don't think we've ever denied it.  And then I met Wilton Darvis.  And I got his autograph.  Dude, don't even mention him in the same breath as us.  Oh, sorry.  I'm serious.  I met a-hole over at K-Rock.  Don't even mention him.  Don't even refer to him.  Okay.  He's just a little blip on the radio screen, man.  He means nothing to us. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, okay, because I was going to say, he dissed you.  Who cares if he dissed us?  Well, I dissed him back.  Just picking up for you guys.  I tried calling to tell you guys about it, but I kept hanging up on me.  All right, thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Over now.  Oh, a guy that has half our ratings dissed us, Anthony.  I can't take it.  Vinny, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  How are you?  I'm pretty good.  I called up Irving Plaza.  Yeah.  And they were, like, shocked that I knew that they knew, that I knew SDP and Santa.  I was like, yeah, what's going on? 
[00:50:00]  How much are tickets going to be?  And they were, like, just, they were totally shocked.  Like, how did you know?  I was like, my ticket hookup, O.P. and Anthony.  We dumped out.  We don't need to mention anyone that has half the ratings of us.  Yeah.  We're on.  Thank you, Vinny.  All right, man.  All right, bye.  Oh, my God.  Alisa, what's up?  Hi, guys.  How you doing?  Hi.  Good to have you back.  Thank you.  Listen.  Yeah, it took us 20 minutes today to, you know, shake things up in this town. 
[00:50:30]  Well, I'm doing my part.  I want to let you know.  Oh, good.  I called K-Rock.  Yeah.  You know, first, you announced it.  I said, let's, let's.  So, I couldn't do it first.  Look, look, look, look.  Honey, honey.  Yes?  No names.  No names.  Because we don't acknowledge anyone that has half the ratings of us.  Right.  We're doing a name moratorium.  Right.  Just like other people that don't mention us.  We're not mentioning anyone else.  I apologize.  All right.  Anyway, so I decided to call.  Yeah.  And first, the phone kept ringing and ringing and ringing.  And then finally, some chick answers. 
[00:51:00]  And I'm like, yeah, hi.  You know, I said, can I request a song?  So, I went into the guys requesting a song.  She's like, okay, what do you want to hear?  So, I put in my request.  I go, oh, yeah, by the way, when are you guys going to announce that STP is playing at Irving Plaza?  So, she's like, oh, not another one of you a-holes.  And she's like, you know, they're going to be getting pounded over there.  Oh, I know.  Pounded.  It's really cold.  All right, thank you.  No problem.  Have a great day, guys.  Bye.  Bye.  She came drastically close to a ping pong game. 
[00:51:30]  I just don't agree with radio stations that waste three or four days teasing something as simple as a concert announcement.  Well, we knew.  We talked to the bass player himself, Rob, on the plane.  And why not?  They're announcing it right now.  Now they're announcing it?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  It's your joke! 
[00:52:00]  Ha ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha ha!  Virgin.  I love the fact we can control all the radio stations.  It's so much fun. 
[00:52:30]  That announcement was supposed to take place, what, 14, 15 hours from now.  Oops, sorry.  Oops.  Remember what station you heard it first at, though?  N.E.W., S.D.P., playing Irving Plaza tomorrow night.  Boy, that was a quick contingency plan, wasn't it?  All right.  We'll announce it here.  On this show, unless Hopi and Anthony screw it up.  It looks like their PD doesn't go out and get ice cream during the day.  Yeah.  He was able to figure something out.  Spur of the moment, Anthony.  Yeah.  Why not? 
[00:53:00]  Oh, my God.  Ha ha ha ha ha!  Oh, my God.  Jesus Christ.  I love mixing crap up in this town, man.  Too much fun.  Syndication never.  Well.  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Oh, well.  We had to do our listeners a service.  Of course.  We always put our listeners before ourselves, don't we?  Ha ha ha!  All right.  We definitely have to take a break.  We're running late here.  Yeah.  And we'll be back with more damage in just a bit. 
[00:53:30]  Good day, New York.  I, Mayor Quimby, would like to be your senator.  If elected, I would use your tax dollars to put Hopi and Anthony on radio stations across  this great land.  Syndication now.  Anthony, Priceline.com.  Priceline.  Too bad you can't name your own price for concert tickets.  Yes.  Yes.  Priceline.  Priceline.com.  Yes.  That's big.  Very big.  Yeah.  Yeah, day doesn't go by, Hopi.  Someone announcing some big new internet thing. 
[00:54:00]  So here it is.  You ready?  You ready?  Yeah.  Priceline's bigger than day.  It's on the internet, you know.  And you can name your own price for groceries.  Hey, we know this.  Wait a minute.  I thought it was going to be something new.  Oh, people know this already.  You go to the stores you shop at, you can name your own price for groceries with Priceline.com.  Go to their website, Priceline.com.  Name your own price for everything you buy.  Beef, chicken, soda, cereal, coffee, diapers, whatever the hell you need. 
[00:54:30]  And you can save up to half off your grocery bill.  Half off.  What are you waiting for?  Why don't you do this?  Shop wherever you shop.  A&P ShopRite, Waldron's, King Cullen, Gristides, Tagostino Food Emporium.  Hundreds and hundreds of stores wherever you shop.  And name your own price for groceries with Priceline.com.  First airline tickets now.  Groceries up to half off.  Log on to Priceline before you go to the store.  Priceline for groceries.  It's bigger than big. 
[00:55:00]  Train, red, green.  What's that, a train?  What's that, a train?  O.P. and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  Train wreck radio.  Ain't that the truth?  You never know what's going to happen when you listen to the O.P. and Anthony show.  Keep your hands and feet inside the cars at all times.  Jesus, man. 
[00:55:30]  Captain Kirk checking in.  Yeah.  James T. Kirk here.  I need Stone Temple pilot tickets, so I called Priceline.com while listening to my favorite  radio show, the O.P. and Anthony show, My Concert Connection.  Ouch.  Greg from Newark.  Guys, welcome back.  Welcome back.  We were gone a day.  One lousy day.  Hey, what is your opinion of the new morning show?  How can you have an opinion?  They just started.  I didn't hear them this morning. 
[00:56:00]  I haven't heard them yet.  We were in L.A. yesterday, and then I was, boy, I was sleeping this morning.  Yeah.  I didn't even want to get up.  Sorry, that sounded too good.  I needed to crank that for a second there.  Go ahead.  I always set my alarm, you know, a little early there, O.P. so I could wake up, catch a little  dust, CNBC, Squawk Box, see what the market's going to be doing, and then get on the computer.  I was just so beaten by last week and yesterday, and then today, I didn't even want to trade. 
[00:56:30]  I popped online for a little bit.  I'm just like, yeah, we're our big recovery, though.  Look at this.  NASDAQ only down 70 points.  Well, we need to get Stockbroker Dave on the phone in about 15 or 20 minutes, because  it must have been just a wild scene on the floor today.  But the morning show, I mean, you guys, God, man, it brings back memories, because when  Ant and I started here about two years ago, people wanted our heads.  No one wanted to give us a chance. 
[00:57:00]  All we ask is you guys give the new shows a chance before you make your opinion.  I was reading some emails saying, yeah, the morning show sucks.  You can't make an opinion on something.  How the hell are you going to say that?  You've heard one so far.  Unbelievable.  It takes a good couple weeks just to get situated in your new environment, you know?  Here was us when we first got here.  Hi, it's Opie and Anthony.  It's our first day on the air.  Let's get to know the listeners.  Take a call.  You suck.  Play the music.  Shut up.  We hate you.  Go away.  Right.  Thank you.  Right.  You guys really suck.  Right. 
[00:57:30]  We didn't even have a chance to suck yet.  And then I wanted to.  And then just like, just to make it even worse, then they would request a really bad classic  rock song.  Yeah.  You guys suck.  Can you play some Super Tramp?  Super Tramp?  You guys really blow?  And like, you know, I don't even know why you're on the air.  You're not entertaining.  If anything, could you just put Bungle in the jungle on?  Right.  So, that's our stance on all the shows here.  Give them a chance.  You know, the funny thing is. 
[00:58:00]  Play some Marshall Tucker, man.  Right.  Catch a C.  Marshall Tucker.  Remember when Stephen Suh started, Anthony?  Yeah.  Who?  Stephen Suh.  The Manson and Kaczynski Morning Show.  They are long gone.  Yeah.  They got their little boxes and had to clean out their desk.  Clean out the desk thing and everything.  Kind of sad to see some more people leave this place.  I read some stuff on his website that he was blaming the old regime. 
[00:58:30]  Old regime?  Yeah, now there's no one to blame.  Right.  That's it.  You know, I got, I was reading some of the stuff on his website though and I'm like,  you know, I got to give him that one.  Like, because he had told us this too.  He tried getting out of his contract before he even took the airwaves.  Because he knew that it was a mess.  He realized, yeah, he saw there was no plan.  We have talked about this before.  Our boss told us there was this master plan and we finally realized like a month after  we were hired that there was no plan.  Let's make sure everyone realizes this is the old bosses we're talking about. 
[00:59:00]  Right.  We enjoy the new bosses so far.  But in time, they'll piss us off too.  Yeah.  So the old regime hires Steve and puts him with Sue and tries to get a morning show going  underneath all these restrictions that the old regime had.  And Steve was just like, oh my God, there's no plan.  I want out of my contract.  He sat down to dinner with our old bosses and said, look, I want out of this now.  And they were just like, no, no, you go and do a show, blah, blah, blah.  But the only thing is, once you're put in that position, you have to perform and do your show. 
[00:59:30]  You've got to make the best of it.  Right.  Make the best of it.  Like what we did, we just said we're not going to give two flying Fs what they say and we're  going to do our show.  If they fire us, they fire us.  If we do well, we did well on our terms.  If we bombed, we bombed on our terms.  Yes.  I don't think he took it to the level he wanted to take it.  And he backed down, I think, to some of the bosses.  Well, and the show just got the best of the poor kid.  Yeah.  Remember when we first went to lunch with this guy?  Oh, my God.  He was a slim guy.  He was full of energy. 
[01:00:00]  He was straight from California.  Where was he working?  L.A., San Diego, one of those places.  We'd take him to lunch to get to know the guy.  And, yeah, he looks young and vibrant.  He was thin.  He was tan.  He was ready to come to New York and kick ass.  Right.  You know, we had some bad blood between us as time went on.  And so I decided not to run into him on purpose.  Yeah.  The other day I finally ran into him, one of his last days here.  Oh, my God.  Didn't even recognize him.  This place almost killed that guy.  It really did. 
[01:00:30]  He must have gained 50 pounds.  He was saying on his website that it gave him a bleeding ulcer and made him depressed clinically.  He put down on his website.  So it was like, oh, my God.  This place almost killed him.  Almost killed him.  When I saw him coming out of the elevator, it was last week.  I honestly felt really bad.  I'm like, man, this place just took its toll on this guy.  All of a sudden, I thought there was a W.C. Fields impersonator on the floor.  But it was, oh, no, it was Steve.  Oh, my God.  He looked like a tick. 
[01:01:00]  Drunk me.  He looked like a tick.  I'm on drugs.  I'm getting depressions.  Loompa.  Yeah.  Loompa.  Loompa.  It looked like where the oompa loompas were pushing around.  Man.  God damn, that's a mess.  I wish them nothing but the best.  I hope they both find peace and happiness away from this place.  Yeah, at least they're in a better place.  They are in a better place.  I think he's blaming the good humor man.  The good humor man.  Is that the official name for our old boss? 
[01:01:30]  What?  The good humor man.  The ice cream man.  Mr. Softy.  But remember, way back then, we told everyone to give the new, you know, Stephen Sue a chance.  It turned out that they did suck.  Yeah.  But before you make that opinion, you guys got to give the new shows a couple months.  Right.  Well, you do.  And a few of the shows have been here almost a couple of months, so.  Well, what are you saying?  People are making their judgments already? 
[01:02:00]  Judgments already?  I've heard nothing but positive so far.  So have I.  Because I think you could hear coming through the radio that everyone here really wants to win,  and they're working their asses off.  Yeah.  To be successful.  A big difference in what we had when we first got here.  Oh, hell yeah.  People that were just like, you know, cash in their paychecks.  Cash the check.  That's what it's all about.  They could care less about ratings, hence the last place performance of this radio station.  And then with the bosses that were in place, it just, it went on and on. 
[01:02:30]  It wouldn't end.  But like, when are these people getting fired?  When are they going to bring in some new blood?  Where's the energy?  Oh, don't worry.  It's right around the corner.  Oh, my God.  We're in the new millennium.  Yeah.  Hall.  Hall.  This was supposed to have happened years ago.  Now you walk down the hall, like we were saying earlier.  Energy.  People running in and out of offices.  People running.  I don't know what it was.  I don't know what they're doing, but it looks like they're keeping busy, at least, which is smart.  The other people didn't even try to make it look like they were busy.  I think I actually saw Earl working just to try to keep up. 
[01:03:00]  They're going to be on to us.  Nah, I'm kidding.  They're going to be on to us soon.  We're going to have to start working, it looks like.  Yeah, I know.  Because in the past, we realized what we were surrounded with, so we're like, ah, look what these guys are doing.  We're going to put in half an effort, and it'll look great.  But I have a feeling we're going to have to start hustling around here.  TJ, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I called up K-Rock before the fat boy over there announced the concert date.  Yeah.  And they have some lady screaming the calls.  It's like, I don't even know if she's even on the air over there.  Yeah.  I got it on the speakerphone, so I set up a recorder.  You like that?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[01:03:30]  We'll get in trouble.  We'll get in trouble.  No, no, no, no, no.  We already announced that big concert announcement.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  The other station will give it to you in 15 hours from now.  Stone Temple Pilots at Irving Plaza.  Big secret show being announced tomorrow.  Ouch.  Think ahead and call Irving Plaza to see if there's tickets available.  Well, next time they want to do a secret show, they're going to have to make sure they put the band on private planes. 
[01:04:00]  No member of any of the surprise band should be on the airplane with Opie and Anthony when they fly from L.A. to New York for this show at Irving Plaza.  Thank you, Rob DeLeo.  Rob DeLeo, sitting right there in first class as we're walking on the plane.  Hey, Rob.  What are you doing?  Love the new album.  STP's great.  You guys rock.  What are you coming to New York for?  Really?  You're doing a show at Irving Plaza?  Really?  Wednesday night? 
[01:04:30]  Isn't that amazing?  Okay, no.  We're going to announce that on our show.  Cool.  And in all fairness, we were oblivious of what was going on because we were in L.A.  And it turned out, I guess, a certain radio station teased the fact that Stone Temple Pilots are playing Irving Plaza tomorrow night.  They teased it all weekend long.  Big, huge concert announcement tomorrow morning.  They're going to start sequestering bands before the concerts.  Yeah, so if, you know, you're trying to lop a head off over there, some poor sap that's making two bucks an hour in promotions, it wasn't. 
[01:05:00]  No, not this time, anyway.  Yeah, no worries.  Well, I didn't say anything.  All right, quick break.  We've got to get into other things here, okay?  Yes.  But very excited about Stone Temple Pilots playing Irving Plaza tomorrow.  Absolutely.  Hoping to get myself a ticket.  Yeah, right.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Oh, to be wild.  Boo, boo, boo. 
[01:05:30]  Or stupidity on the way.  Hey, Anthony Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  We love Paisano.  Yeah, I believe you have time to go down there tomorrow for a nice Italian meal before you go to the Stone Temple Pilots show at Irving Plaza tomorrow night.  Yeah, if you want to do that.  That would make for a great night.  Get a bite to eat at Paisano.  And then you head over to the secret STP show at Irving Plaza tomorrow night. 
[01:06:00]  And I think that would be a lot of fun.  That'd be great.  We love Paisano.  We're there all the time.  Someone from the show is there, I think, if not eating, sweeping the floors or washing the windows.  Something.  Incredible, authentic Italian cuisine made from real old-world Italian recipes.  Brought over by Joey's family many years ago on the Nina, the Pinta, and the Santa Maria.  That's right.  Portions are huge.  You all right, Anthony?  Oh, I'm fine, Alphie. 
[01:06:30]  I'm just reading through this.  I don't think I've ever read the copy.  Oh, really?  Of Paisano, no.  I know.  There's some interesting things in this copy.  The portions of Paisano are huge.  Incredible pasta lunch specials, too.  He's been advertising with us for a year.  We've never mentioned that they have great lunch specials.  Great lunch specials.  I think that's something you might want to mention if you're doing a live read for Paisano of Mulberry Street.  You're doing some business down there in Little Italy, around that area.  You want to stop in for lunch?  They have incredible pasta lunch specials at Paisano. 
[01:07:00]  I never even thought of that.  I thought maybe for dinner you'd go down there.  But lunch?  Joey must look at the numbers and go, man, you know, the advertising with Opie and Anthony is doing great.  My business at night is unbelievable.  What about the daytime?  But for some reason, lunch is still not showing any results from these live reads.  Lunch at Paisano.  Lunch at Paisano.  Go ahead.  All right, and the big news, Ann, if you go down there, you see Joey, you tell him,  hey, Joey, Opie and Anthony sent me, and he will give you a glass of wine in the house, okay?  Even during lunch? 
[01:07:30]  I believe so, yes.  Oh, how about that?  And take it from me, their wine list is really, really good.  Yeah.  Really good.  It's Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  Give them a call, 965-1188.  That's 965-1188.  Opie, you're a sick ass, man.  Anthony, you're not a jackass.  You're obviously a stud.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It makes me sick.  1027-WNEW.  It's the O&A Show. 
[01:08:00]  Trying to get a hold of us today.  212-757-1027.  We need to get Stockbroker Dave on the line.  Having a hard time getting through to him, so if anyone knows Stockbroker Dave, tell him to call us immediately.  I guess the stock market made an incredible comeback in the last hour and a half of trading, Anthony.  Opie, unbelievable comeback.  Now, when we checked it just before 2 o'clock, 1.30-ish, the Dow and Nasdaq were down close to 600 points, right? 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, the Nasdaq was down like 600 and the Dow down in the fives.  We closed with the Dow down 46 points.  That's an incredible comeback.  11,175 and the Nasdaq closes down 74 points.  That's it.  41.48.  What the hell changed in the last two hours of trading?  A lot of people picking up some bargains, I think. 
[01:09:00]  But if you ask me, these aren't the stable people buying into these stocks at those low prices.  Like, all of a sudden, they got pushed up.  Some of these stocks were down, I swear to God, like 30 points.  And they close even today or up.  You know what that means?  They're saturated with day traders and people that scoop these things up at a bargain.  And this thing is going to go up and down and up and down for a while now.  Do you expect to see a sell-off tomorrow morning, Anthony?  I think some of these things, yes. 
[01:09:30]  A lot of the people that bought into these at bargain basement prices are going to see that they've made some cash and pull out.  Push it back down.  And then people are going to buy back in.  It's going to go back up.  I think a lot of the mutual fund people and whatnot pulled out of these things.  A lot of the stability that was there for a while, they pulled out and it's replaced with people like me.  And if I see I've made a couple of grand, gone.  Mr. Moore. 
[01:10:00]  Jay Moore in the studio.  How are you doing, Jay?  Hi, guys.  I was going to let you finish your NASDAQ speech.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, we're just trying to balance out the very big day in the market today.  Trying to balance out our show topics.  You still playing the market?  Are you day trading like a blackhead still?  Yeah.  All right, hold on.  We've got Stockbroker Dave, the guy that's on the floor.  Dave!  Yes, this is CNBC, live from the floor.  Yeah, sure.  The biggest jerk-off in the world.  And we have Jay Moore in the studio, too.  Stockbroker Dave.  Hi, Jay. 
[01:10:30]  Nice to meet you.  Hey, nice to meet you.  When are you going to come down to the floor and say hi to all you adoring fans?  I'm on my way.  After it's closed, crazy man.  It's probably lit.  Oh, sorry about that.  I know you had a weird day, Dave, but stop the cursing.  Unbelievable.  And as far as Jay Moore making it to the floor, I don't think Jay gets up before 4 o'clock,  so that ain't happening.  Of course, there's not many fags down here.  Wow.  I don't know if we're homophobic or anything.  So, Stockbroker Dave, what the hell happened today? 
[01:11:00]  It's over.  The carnage is over.  Oh, you think so, huh?  It's over, Anthony.  What a finale to the carnage, though.  Unbelievable.  How many people did you see plummeting past windows today?  When the NASDAQ was down 500 points.  500 points?  Yeah, 500.  500 points he's down.  He's down 74.  He's on the second floor.  A miraculous turnaround.  Yeah, I threw myself out the window earlier, but I was on the first floor.  I just fell into some bushes and kind of scraped myself. 
[01:11:30]  So, what the hell happened at the end of the day there?  Ah, just, uh, the market was actually up 20 points, and it finished, uh, down 46 points.  46.  And, uh, meaningless.  The carnage is over.  Yeah?  Get back into the water.  Oh, yeah.  The water is fine.  The water is fine.  The correction is over.  Let me tell you something.  This has to come back so bad for me to even break even, my friend.  Get, get, get, so it don't matter. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Tell me about it.  Half or nothing at this point.  I gotta tell you something.  All last week, I was saying, this has to be the bottom.  Has to be.  Oh, buy in now.  This has to be the bottom.  You've seen it.  It just kept going.  And then today, it just opened up and, uh, totally crashed.  Trade it down to 36.50.  The NASDAQ, 36.50.  They were just celebrating 5,000.  What stock do you have?  Uh, I have a stock that is not yippee. 
[01:12:30]  And, uh, some, some, uh, wacky, uh, auction site.  That, uh, I guess it rhymes with, uh, C-Gay.  Would you stay gay?  Would you stay...  I think Jay just perked up.  Don't say that next to Jay.  Oh, that's up 23 bucks, Anthony.  Yeah, I noticed.  That's why I'm still here and not in tears.  I actually had a good day.  Hey!  Let's save this ass.  Hey, so, Dave, is word on the, uh, floor that Jay Moore's a homosexual? 
[01:13:00]  That's...  That's word everywhere in New York.  I'm gonna have to come down there and, like, how do you, like...  And F them?  Yeah, I'll prove I'm not gay by knocking people out and having sex with them.  Hey!  Hey!  Marco, enough.  How do you get in here again?  Hey!  I don't think there's anything wrong with it.  Yeah.  There is something wrong with it.  It hurts.  Only if you receive...  Exactly.  I'll never do that again.  So, Dave, you guys survived down there today. 
[01:13:30]  Barely.  Oh, hope.  It's incredible.  Yeah.  Everyone was running around today.  You know what was great?  You go on some of the message boards on, like, RagingBull.com.  Right.  And, uh, everyone was blaming everybody.  At one point, I think Opie and Anthony were being blamed for the crash.  I swear to God, people lost everything and felt compelled to write it on a message board.  There goes my, uh, my life savings and my children's education.  Thank you, Alan Greenspan.  Like, Greenspan came over, grabbed this guy's cash, and put it in, uh, something.com. 
[01:14:00]  Amazing.  NASDAQ was at, like, 2,500 in August.  Yeah.  And I think it got up to 5,200.  I think it figured it's 20% corrections, like 1,000 points.  So it should have stopped at, like, 42.  No, it fell, it fell through all of the, uh, all of the support levels.  All the support levels.  You said that like Tom Lakers.  Come on!  Did you hear him?  He just said that.  It fell through all the support levels.  That's what I, and here's a squawk box every morning.  Oh, yeah.  I, I couldn't even bear to turn it on this morning. 
[01:14:30]  After yesterday.  I, I'm saying to myself, I'm going, why does, why doesn't the NASDAQ just crash 1,000 points in one day, and let's get back to recovery?  What's this 200 points one day, 180 the next, 300?  Just do it all in a day.  But today was the day, Anthony.  Yeah, I guess it was.  So you, you're feeling much better about it?  It's over.  That's it, huh?  Well, look, when you pop the zip, the, the zip right on your cheek.  Right, it's getting better.  You know, it was hurting, it was hurting, it was hurting.  It was festering, painful.  God.  Okay, well, I hope so. 
[01:15:00]  It's over.  Let's just say, I hope so.  Any, any heart attacks on the floor today?  Nah, but we thought one guy was.  Really?  Yeah, we really did.  My clerk said, I think this guy's going to have a freaking heart attack.  Oh, man.  It's getting pretty stressful down there.  Just on a regular day, you guys are all stressed out.  There was so much paper going in and out of their hands.  What a recovery today, though.  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  Anthony, you know, I'm not kidding.  It's healthy.  I didn't think I'd see something like this.  But it leads me to believe that there's some unstable investments here. 
[01:15:30]  Like, it's not the institutions that are invested in these things now.  It's a bunch of people with laptops.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know, I told you, I'm sorry to stop at the market.  My lawn's, the landscaper who cuts my lawn comes over and he's fully invested.  Many bargains today.  Many bargains.  You've got to be kidding me.  You've got to be kidding me.  This is what's driving the market?  Yeah.  Well, the Ups guys, they trade in between deliveries now.  Yeah.  Amazing.  They've had a fortune on their IPO.  I literally feel like I'm listening to a conversation between, like, the premiere of Japan and the premiere of Korea. 
[01:16:00]  This is like, because I haven't, I've got nothing.  Jay, it's not all about anal sex.  Right.  No, I know.  You've got to balance out the show topics.  No, no, I completely understand.  That's why I'm, like, laying low.  Right, yeah.  I'm just saying, like...  Well, that's what it is.  Like, when Jay's in the studio, you just talk about fag.  The next week, it's about fag.  What do you do with your cash?  You put it in your, uh, your, uh, mattress, your, uh, noose, Cerns and Foster, uh, my, I keep all my cash under my Rockaway bedding mattress. 
[01:16:30]  No, I got, like, um, back, way back when, when I was, like, 18, I got, like, 30 grand in, like, IDS, and that just stayed the same.  Then I pulled out of there, because the guy got weird on me.  So, that stayed the same.  And then I got, like, uh, I got, like, half a million in, like, uh, like, bonds.  Oh, those, those things.  Like, old lady.  Like, like my grandmother does.  Exactly.  No, no, exactly.  You're a young guy.  It's time for some risk.  Well, now that I got half a mil stuck away, now I can, like, you know, piss away 10 grand. 
[01:17:00]  You buy H.D. of P.D.  Come on, we're not happy unless everyone's losing.  Why, why, yeah, but you guys are all taking dives.  It's not fun to drink alone.  The market fell, the market fell 100 points, and I made 10 grand yesterday.  Come on, it's time to get in.  Come on.  Come on.  What is fine?  There's some bargains out there.  Bargains, yes.  I want you to come by my house and give me, like, the real scoop.  Forget that insider training below.  Come on up.  I'll put some champagne on ice for you. 
[01:17:30]  We'll put on some, uh, you know, Schindler's Fist, some gay porn.  Dune buddies.  Some of the earlier Peter North stuff.  Hey, hey.  Marco, enough.  Ha!  Hey.  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Last night, uh, Dina Colo was on stage for, I think we timed it, it was six seconds.  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  And somebody just went, FBA!  FBA!  FBA!  Six seconds!  And he goes, all right, he goes, let's get this out of the way. 
[01:18:00]  And the O.P. and Anthony fans here, and the place absolutely went bananas.  And then, no, that's sick.  We'll get to all that later.  We had Stephen Lynch come up, too.  Cool.  All right.  And he played it.  Get out.  Lynch played FBA last night?  Stephen Lynch played full-blown agent.  Get out of here.  Extended version.  Ha!  That bastard!  Yes, but it was under the name Richard Bachman.  He would not use his...  Burt Baccarat.  All right.  All right, Dave, we're going to finish up.  Soft white underbelly.  All right, Dave.  I'm calling him Richard.  His name's Dave.  Huh? 
[01:18:30]  I've been calling him Richard all day.  I thought it was a joke.  Stock market Dave.  Stock broker Dave, yeah.  I call it Dave.  I just woke up.  He's the man on the floor, man.  All right.  The market was in turmoil.  The free world, as we know it, was thrown in turmoil as you were snoozing.  Yeah.  In that case, you had no idea.  Who's the jackass?  Yeah, you're right.  I was sound asleep.  I had Savannah right across my nose.  I had Savannah across my nose.  I had Chase Elaine downstairs. 
[01:19:00]  I'm gone.  All right.  Hey, Dave, thanks a lot.  Boy, nice speaking to you as always.  Definitely.  Dave, call me.  All right.  Be well, guys.  All right, man.  I love you, Dave.  Yeah, nice meeting you, Dave.  Sexy.  Hey!  Stock broker Dave.  There he goes.  He says the carnage is over.  Today was the last little blast.  All I took from that is that he thinks I'm gay.  Because I don't know any stock market stuff.  That might have been a shorter bet than what he said about the stock market.  Oh, God.  All right.  And we've got to take a quick break, and then we'll get into the Jay Moore plug next. 
[01:19:30]  Cool.  We'll be there with Vinny Testaverde tomorrow.  All right.  All right.  A gigantic boombox is coming down the street.  Hand me the RPG 7.  Rocky and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  Ligus.  Enough of the Ligus. 
[01:20:00]  Jay Moore in the studio played Rascals last night.  I heard it was a great, great show.  Stephen Lynch played full-blown AIDS.  Wait, right off the bat, though, I have a problem with you.  What?  Milwaukee Barks hat?  Well, it was a gift.  Why would you wear a Barks hat?  Because it's cool.  What do you really like in the NBA?  The Knicks.  And why are you wearing a Barks hat?  Because it's green, it's got the antlers, it looks cool.  Because I'm gay, all right?  And look at it.  Hey, look at it.  Look at this hat.  It's a cool hat.  You can't front on that hat.  Yeah, but you don't. 
[01:20:30]  The Knicks likes it.  Support the Knicks.  I do support the Knicks.  How do you support the Knicks with a Barks hat?  I support the Knicks when I pay good money to go watch Patrick Ewing's finger roll when he should dunk.  Well, you know what?  You know what?  That's what Patrick Ewing does to the Knicks fans, though.  He pisses us off.  Wow.  And he's expecting to get re-signed.  Yeah, 18 million.  Shaq handed it to him over the weekend.  And he backed down in front of Shaq. 
[01:21:00]  Shaq's a monster, man.  Lakers made us look stupid yesterday.  We are stupid.  The whole East is stupid.  Two days ago, I should say.  The whole East is stupid.  Jay, is this how you felt when we were talking about the stock market?  I'm out of it.  That's out of the basketball discussion.  That's more gay than anything else to be out of sports, you know?  I didn't say sports.  I said basketball.  I have no love at the game whatsoever.  So it looks like the cocaine is helping out Shane Spencer.  He had a big bomb last year.  Hey, how about that?  How about that?  They said Shane Spencer does a lot of blow.  That's why he had the problem with his heart last year. 
[01:21:30]  Well, let's say allegedly.  Allegedly.  Thank you.  I'm just telling you what I heard.  Some reports.  See, as you guys know, I'm on the inside.  It's too early to start talking about baseball.  Who cares?  Got to let them play 50 games before you get into it.  Every team wins 50.  Every team loses 50.  It's what you do with the other 50 to lose.  That's right.  You know who said that?  Who?  I just said it.  No, I've heard that before.  Yeah, I think it was Buckshaw Walter, actually.  So who wins the NBA title this year?  Jay Moore.  The Lakers.  Yeah. 
[01:22:00]  They're too big, too strong.  Yeah.  I think the East is just a joke.  The Knicks right now would be a 7th seed in the West.  Does Indiana have a shot?  No.  No, I don't think so either.  Okay.  Hmm.  It's kind of sad.  Is it?  The Lakers are just running away with it.  And they're looking...  They are?  And they've lost one game in 27?  Something ridiculous like that?  Is that bad?  He has no idea. 
[01:22:30]  Why?  Well, you know what it is, Anthony, they get so many touchdowns that nobody can compete  with them.  Do they?  Hmm.  All right.  Why do I have a Bucs cap on?  What hat is that you got on?  It's just an Abercrombie stupid hat I got.  I wasn't advertising some fair company.  But it doesn't say Abercrombie.  It just says, what does it say?  It's got the number on.  It's got the number on.  I knew it was an Abercrombie hat.  It's better than a Bucs hat.  No, it's not.  Dude, no one wears Bucs merchandise.  Exactly.  That's how cool I am.  I'm rolling around in a Bucs cap. 
[01:23:00]  People are like, why are you wearing a Bucs cap?  That's how cool I am.  Wear that Bucs cap on stage.  How modest you are.  Wear the Bucs cap on stage.  You'll get booed right off the stage.  I would, but my hair looks too cool.  My hair is gone.  Oh, yeah.  Well, first of all, five.  Now, we have a couple other guys that want a piece of you today.  That would last long, me and Opie.  Well, I would take you on.  Would you give me a better fight than Anthony did?  Cursing all over the place.  You're just cursing. 
[01:23:30]  Well, I just woke up.  This is how we get going.  Dude, you look at it, man.  Your eyes are tired.  It's not equal.  Hey, Anthony's got that white trash inner rage.  Is that what it is?  Right.  Jeez, thank you for the compliment, Jack.  I think that was a compliment, yeah.  All right, let's move on to something else.  I handed the article over to Anthony on the plane yesterday.  Banking on that space, you being in that movie, huh? 
[01:24:00]  Come on.  Are they done filming the movie?  No, I'm still filming it.  I just got like a two-week break.  Oh, really?  Let me fight it.  Dude, did you just cream when he won?  Absolutely.  Come on.  I was at the improv in Tempe, and I told you guys, I swear to God, I'm on stage in Tempe,  Arizona, and somebody goes, Marpa, Hawaii.  And I did like a Wile E. Coyote quadruple take, like, Marpa, Marpa, Marpa.  Triangle or Moloch? 
[01:24:30]  I'm like, are you an 0 and 8 fan?  And like eight people are like, whoo!  In Arizona?  Exactly.  They were on vacation.  They tracked me down.  They're hunters.  We ran into some of our listeners in Anaheim over the weekend.  You guys are global, man.  I'm telling you.  I was upstairs watching the Oscars in the green room, and they go, and the Oscar goes to,  and I'm like, they're going to give it to Denzel, the son of a bitch.  They're going to give it to Denzel.  I couldn't even look at the screen.  And they go, Kevin Spacey for a minute.  And I just stood up, and I walked downstairs.  I was going, I'm in a hit movie. 
[01:25:00]  I'm in a hit movie.  I'm in a hit movie.  The kid from Sixth Sense should have won, though.  No, Tom Cruise should have won.  I heard his performance was good.  You didn't see it?  No.  When you see it, you won't even believe it.  It's the sickest thing I've ever seen.  Speaking of Kevin Spacey, though.  Oh, that thing that was in the Enquirer, was it, or the Globe?  Which one?  One of the rag magazines has some very interesting pictures of Kevin Spacey.  With who?  Leaving his, I guess, a hotel room or apartment.  It says right on the cover, proof that he's gay or something like that. 
[01:25:30]  Finally, they got proof.  A restaurant with some male model.  21 or 22-year-old.  They go up to this little hilltop in this park, and there's this telephoto lens.  I mean, you could probably see the lunar module on the moon with this lens that they were using.  Hubble.  Yeah.  It was the Hubble lens.  So it's blurry, but you could tell it's them.  And it's like, here they are.  Here's Kevin giving him a little full body massage.  Here they are rolling around.  And then you just see him laying down with, like, one of the guys, Kevin's arm over the guy. 
[01:26:00]  Cuddling.  Cuddling.  Wow.  A little horse play on the top of this hill, and then they walk down a couple hours later.  And Kevin with his head laying in his lap, and the kids laugh.  Well, maybe it was his nephew.  Yeah, right?  I asked him flat out.  Really?  He said no.  We were at a...  We were having sex.  The joke's on him.  The joke's on him, because I'm not in any game.  No, we were playing blackjack.  It was me, him, Helen... 
[01:26:30]  Is that what you call it?  Me, him, Helen Hunt.  Hey!  Marco, enough.  Backjack.  Black...  Blackback.  Blackback.  Sorry.  We were playing black crack.  We were playing black crack.  We were playing black.  It was me, him, Helen Hunt, and Mike Myers at a blackjack table.  Yeah.  And I go, uh, did you ever get a hold of Tom Juno, that guy in Esquire magazine that wrote that, like, butcher job on him?  And he goes, no, and if I did, I'd punch him right in his face. 
[01:27:00]  I go, that was awful.  Because it was fiction.  I go, it was worse than fiction.  It was just, like, bad.  And I go, well, are you?  He goes, what?  I go, are you?  And he goes, am I gay?  No.  And I went, all right.  All right.  Well, you got to see these pictures.  Maybe he was losing.  And gay, he meant happy.  Someone run out and get that.  I think it's, uh, I left him on the plane.  Yeah?  It's one of the rag magazines.  It says right on the cover that there's pictures.  No, no, of course.  What?  Did I miss something?  No, he asked him face to face, and he said no. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  Whatever assumptions you want to, uh...  I asked him.  Draw.  How's that Helen Hunt look these days?  Looking good.  Big forehead, huh?  No, she's looking good.  Does she, yeah?  She's playing like a white trash teacher, like in, uh, like the outskirts of Vegas.  Yeah.  I'm not a teacher.  Like, um, uh, he's the teacher.  She's like the, uh, the single mom bartender, like white trash.  Right.  Like sunburned, uh, single mom.  Very hot, sexy clothing.  Really?  Looking good, huh?  Yeah, full tan.  I saw that other rag magazine with her, uh, pictures in it.  Another telephoto job where she was... 
[01:28:00]  Wearing a thong.  Yeah, wearing a thong.  Not bad.  You know?  Not bad.  Not bad.  For Helen Hunt, you know.  All right, let's go to Darren.  Darren, what's up?  It's not the first on the list when you're thinking of hot Hollywood, you know?  Darren!  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey.  Is there going to be a love scene between Jay Moore and Kevin Spacey in this new movie?  Yes.  Man.  You got a reputation.  Oh, man.  All right, thank you, Darren.  Later.  I can't want...  You kiss a few guys, you drive a Miata, and what happens?  I can't wait to get my hot wife in here. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  Uh, Manny, what's up?  Yeah, none of us have ever seen any.  Hold on.  A wife or a picture.  Remember the last time you were going to come in, you said, yeah, I'll come in tomorrow  before I go back to L.A., and I'll bring my wife.  Well, I've got to find one for her.  And who'd you bring?  DeNicola?  Oh, my God.  Manny, let's go to you.  What's going on?  Hey, how's it going?  Uh, you guys are great, man.  I went to the Jay Moore show last night, and at the end of the show, I asked him for his  autograph, and he just took off on me.  Uh-oh. 
[01:29:00]  Come on.  Manny, I'm sorry.  Uh, man.  Where are you in the front?  Oh, you were the guy in the front row.  Yeah, I think you're the best, but...  You had a tan shirt on.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, you know what it is?  They...  Uh, uh, all right.  I have no excuses.  What they do is they're like...  You see the bouncers, they walk you to and from the stage?  Yeah.  And they just take you to the back of the room, and you have, like, a water, and you,  like, relax for a second.  And then usually the people that hang around, I go back out, and I sign autographs.  Uh, I thought you just took off.  No, I can't.  If I stand there, I won't be able to leave the room for another hour. 
[01:29:30]  Oh.  You know, because there's 500 people in their room.  Yeah, that's true.  I apologize.  Hey, go on hold and, uh, give Rick or somebody your address, and I'll send you, like, a...  I'll send you a picture or something.  Nice.  Great.  All right, hold on, Manny.  Thanks.  All right, uh, you got the pictures?  No, that's the picture of Helen Hunt's, uh, thong sticking out of the top of her, uh...  Yeah.  That don't look bad.  It looks fantastic.  What are you talking about?  Who's this guy?  I mean, she's hot.  Gary Busey swears he's changed his ways after finding God, but he's still wacko. 
[01:30:00]  Does Michael Myers have anything to do with, uh, Mike Myers, to do with the movie you're in?  No, he's just, his wife is really good friends with, uh, Helen.  So, and it's like, he was hanging around.  Where's the Kevin Spacey pictures?  Uh, it's not in that one.  We're going to buy it.  Yeah.  Someone ran out to get it immediately.  Celine butchered her hair off.  You see those pictures?  It's pretty funny.  Is it Celine?  Yeah.  With her camel tongue? 
[01:30:30]  You see that thing?  She is so disgusting.  When she wears those jumpsuits and you just see, like, these knobs hanging off her pelvis.  Did she marry her grandfather?  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  Joey, Joey's on the line saying that you snubbed him last night.  Jay, you are getting a bad rap, man.  What the hell is this?  Joey!  You!  Joey Paisano.  What's up, guys?  Jay snubbed you last night?  I came with my wife.  I drove an hour and a half from Long Island just to see him.  Nothing.  You know, Joey? 
[01:31:00]  Not even a hello.  Oh, my God.  Why don't you come back after the show, moron?  Oh, moron.  You better watch what you're saying.  What are you?  What are you?  What are you, insane?  No, no.  I'm saying.  He goes, this is what Joey does.  First of all, I called you today at the restaurant and I called you Friday when I came in.  I called you at the restaurant.  They're like, no, he's only here during the day.  First of all, why don't you get somebody who speaks freaking English to answer the telephone  and you're a big one?  Oh, my God.  There we go.  Listen, you Guinea-Dago greaseball.  I don't care how many of you come out of the woodwork.  I'm not putting him in that picture. 
[01:31:30]  Come in here with your olive oil skin and your guinea chan.  No, but they're not even Italian.  They're like one guy's from Egypt.  Well, listen, my Mick Crout friend.  Joey, I called you.  I called you.  Are you leaving the show tonight, sir?  Oh, no.  This is what it's come to. 
[01:32:00]  Good night, everybody.  Oh, God.  Wait, that's not part of the show.  Leave the gun.  Take the cannolis.  It'll be behind the tank.  Oh, Jay Moore?  You won't see him no more.  I think my D-Nicola might have to headline Wednesday.  Joey, I called you three times.  In all three times?  I know.  I know.  I win your...  Oh, that's a kiss of death right there.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  So, it's it. 
[01:32:30]  It's over.  I hope you have that easy pass going back to Rascals tonight.  Yeah.  If only Sonny had easy pass.  That's right.  I can't believe you and Eileen didn't come back and say hi.  You're family.  We couldn't get back to it.  That's who wouldn't let us.  Say, I'm Joey Paisano, a friend of Jay's.  And then they come back and go, Joey Paisano, a friend of Jay's.  I go, yes, bring him back.  All right.  I called you three times.  All three times.  No, Joey, I only work during the day. 
[01:33:00]  That's okay.  Joey, go home and do a clock.  Joey, go home and do a clock.  You go down to Paisano tonight.  No, Steven Lynch came over.  He said hello.  I was going.  Ah, Lynch.  Man.  Lynch probably wanted the free glass of wine right there.  I know.  Lynch is a drunk.  I'm out of the drink.  Lynch is a drunk.  He goes down there for the freaky auntie.  Well, Jay, go down to Paisano tonight.  And maybe he'll have a table in the corner with Sergeant McCluskey.  Maybe Michael can join you. 
[01:33:30]  You know, I'm in trouble when we're all sitting there.  Joey goes, I'm going to speak Italian to Jay.  I have to go to the bathroom.  Scusotomy.  Scusotomy.  I'll get you a gabonete.  That was Italian for me.  I used to banter.  Joey, no!  Joey, what are you doing?  Man, you're a bad show.  I'm over here.  I'm going to beat him with the fried ravioli, man. 
[01:34:00]  He's on his way.  Yeah, okay.  All right, guys.  Good to have you back.  All right, Joey.  Great show last night, Jay.  Oh, I feel bad, man.  Don't worry about it, man.  I'm always busting on you.  Don't worry.  You'll feel worse.  Joey, you were on the list, right?  Well, yeah, I was in.  I appreciate it.  Yeah, I got three tickets and he's still busting my job.  And now, let's say you're on the list, too, or a contract or something similar to a list.  I took care of him.  I put him on the list. 
[01:34:30]  You know, we don't call it a list.  Four tickets.  That's 100 bucks right there.  Jay's wife, Dina Cola, just walked in.  What?  He told me about this mystery wife, also.  You haven't seen her either?  I showed you our wedding picture.  Do you have it with you, Jay?  No, I showed him an Eileen wedding picture.  No, you showed me your niece.  Oh, that's right.  It's the same girl.  That's what I call her in case the cops pull us over. 
[01:35:00]  All right, he's waking up, ladies and gentlemen.  If that's the fat guy, I'm leaving.  No.  No.  Yeah, Joey, you know Fat Guy, right?  Yeah.  I punch him.  His name's Clemenza.  Fat Guy has a problem.  I mean, Fat Guy has a problem with Jay Moore, and he's here to confront him.  Is that him?  That's not what you want.  No, we have a lot of fat guys around here, but no.  That's Kevin.  That's big Kevin.  Yeah, I met Kevin.  So much they will.  All right.  All right, Joey.  See you later, guys. 
[01:35:30]  I need you on my side after tonight.  After today.  Oh, yeah.  Now you're going to ask for a favor?  Come on.  You come here on the day of my daughter's holidays in Brooklyn.  Come on.  You snub them.  I didn't snub them again.  That guy's a brand new father.  The guy drove an hour to get there.  He got it for free.  No problem.  No hassle.  How many free meals has Joey given you?  Oh, my God.  Two?  Two out of four.  Two?  Ponderous, man.  That's an effing ponderous.  Only when I bring a celebrity with me. 
[01:36:00]  I bring for a bet.  It's free.  I bring, you know, I bring Dana Cole.  It's like, that's $75.  And please tip the Egyptian busboy.  He goes by Giovanni.  The guy's from Egypt, Joey.  Why is his name Giovanni?  His name's Pete.  His name's Pete.  We like Pete.  Giovanni.  You know Pete?  Yeah.  Jay, I'm sitting in the car to pick you up tonight.  Hello, Jay.  Sit in the front, I mean.  Yeah, sit in the front.  The Clemenza will sit behind you. 
[01:36:30]  Wear your good sneakers that can go through the windshield.  Hello, Carlo.  Hello, Carlo.  Oh, Billy, I have one.  All right, Joey.  Joey Paisano.  Delicious Italian food.  All right, guys.  I'll see you.  There he goes.  So long.  Peace.  And if you go up to...  Oh, my God.  What the hell's wrong with you?  If you go up to Joey and say, hey, Jay snubbed you, you get a free glass of wine at Paisano.  Yeah, that's right.  Hey, John, what's up?  Guinea.  John. 
[01:37:00]  John?  All right.  Hello.  John?  Ponderous.  He's out.  Effing ponderous, man.  We'll take one more call, then we've got to take a break.  Let's go to another John.  John, what's going on?  How you doing?  Great.  Hey.  Hey, I wanted to ask Jay what it was like to dill around with Jennifer Aniston in that  movie, Picture Perfect.  Oh, that was on TV last night.  Picture Perfect.  Yeah, it was on opposite the NCAA.  I know.  You can't catch a break ever, man.  I think those are the same people that put action opposite Frasier. 
[01:37:30]  You know, she's Greek, Jay.  I know she is Greek.  She's got a nice whale eye.  I hear a Greek chick stink.  They stink down there?  Yeah.  I don't...  I won't.  It smelled like pee.  Oh, my God.  Did you, uh...  No, she hated me.  She hated you.  She absolutely hated me.  Now, why?  Really?  Because Jerry Maguire wasn't even, like, out yet.  Yeah.  So I was literally just a stand-up comic.  So?  So I think she wanted...  Oh, because she's got that kind of attitude? 
[01:38:00]  No, I think she...  In her defense, it was her first movie with her name above the title.  I think she wanted, like, a big star opposite her to help sell tickets.  And the director's like, no, this is the guy.  And she's like, what about, uh, Matthew Broderick or a bald one, you know?  Wow.  Where's that?  Don't you stink?  What?  What?  What?  Would you like it to stink, John?  Really, uh...  Thank you.  A stalker.  So would I, actually.  She was really hot when I worked with her.  Yeah.  She didn't lose the weight yet, so she still had the nice big ass.  Yeah, nice dumper.  The big old ass. 
[01:38:30]  The ice cream scooper.  Do it from behind.  The bike in it.  You park your bike in there.  All right.  Do it from behind.  You put your drink up there.  Put your bowling trophy on there.  Sure.  It's a bike rack.  Park your bike in there.  That's great.  Anthony, I'll need some feedback.  Monkey from Long Island.  Where the hell is fat guy?  Let's get this party started.  Are you ready?  This guy, fat guy, really does not like you.  We need to take a break.  He wants to confront you.  I don't know.  We had spoken with him last week, and we couldn't figure out why he had a problem with you. 
[01:39:00]  I can't figure out why anybody would have a problem with me, because I'm nice to everybody.  Like, he's saying, you come on the show, and you take over the show.  But, like, whether that's true or not, it is.  No, no.  But it's our show, and we don't care.  We love when you come on and have a picture with us.  And I don't see what his problem is with that.  What word did I say when you guys are doing your stock market stuff? 
[01:39:30]  No, Jay, you don't have to defend yourself.  Well, we allow people to take over the show.  It gives us a break from the action.  It's not easy to do five hours of talk every day.  No, don't use that word.  Break from the action.  Why?  Come on.  I like that.  My accountant likes that word very much.  I don't know.  Oh, yeah.  So there was a time.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  It was play or play, man.  Oh, cool.  Jay, the other thing we've got to tell you before you invited Fat Guy in, there was a time  when Fat Guy and Paul, Paul Bond, who opened up for you at Rascal's last time you were in town, 
[01:40:00]  were in the studio hanging with us one day,  and you called from L.A., and you were just cracking us up.  We were laughing our balls off.  And they were sitting there just with their arms folded, not even cracking a smile, just pissed off.  And we should have brought it up on the air while you were on the phone, but we didn't.  You should have said they were there.  I know.  We blew it.  Honestly, we blew it because there was definitely a problem there, and we didn't get to the bottom of it.  So why don't you fight the fat guy?  There's no fighting.  There's no fighting.  He wants to talk to you.  We just want to find out what his problem is because if you sucked on the air, 
[01:40:30]  and you came in here and, like, were taking over the show, I mean, that would be one thing.  Someone's farting in here.  But people find it very entertaining when you're on the show.  Now I smell the fart.  Oh, my God.  Rick, is that you?  Jesus Christ, man.  It has a Puerto Rican tinge to it.  Yeah.  Oh, you're just clearing the room.  That's bad.  It has a Puerto Rican etchings to it. 
[01:41:00]  Refried beans.  All right, listen, let's take a break.  Air out the studio.  We'll get fat guy in next and see what his problem is.  Don't fry a banana, Rick.  And don't forget, STP playing Irving Plaza tomorrow night, I think.  Ouch.  What's up?  Oh, this is bad.  This is a bad scene, Jay.  What happened?  Well, another radio station in New York has been teasing the fact that STP's playing a mystery concert tomorrow night.  A mystery concert.  Location's going to be given away tomorrow morning on someone's very popular morning show. 
[01:41:30]  On a high-profile radio show?  Morning or being?  Morning.  But then all of a sudden, we're flying back from L.A., and, oh, geez, look, it's Rob the bass player from STP sitting in first class.  Yeah, he looks like a stand-up comic.  Yeah.  He does that.  He did.  And, gee, he told us what he was doing in New York.  He's going to be playing a show at Irving Plaza Wednesday night.  He's not completely normal.  They do a set, and meanwhile, like, Weiland's offstage pouring vodka into his catheter.  Yeah, he's so frustrated, man, with that whole scene. 
[01:42:00]  Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.  Come on, get out of here.  I can't be real.  That Paul's pissed, too.  There ain't no way.  I am pissed.  You can hold.  All right, hold on.  Wait a minute.  Uh-oh, uh-oh.  I'm sitting out here two freaking hours already.  Uh-oh, uh-oh.  Hi, Paul.  Hey, I'm serious.  Holy smug.  Last time I saw Paul, we were, like, hugging, taking pictures with his family.  What the hell was that?  All right, listen, we've got to take a break so we can get to the bottom of it. 
[01:42:30]  But, uh...  That's a joke, right?  Oh, I swear.  You can't be kidding.  It's kidding.  I don't know.  It's real.  That's real.  Last time I saw him, I was taking a picture with his, like, girlfriend, his family.  That's real.  Anyway, the STP thing.  He looks mad at you, not me.  I don't...  Well, we'll find out what his problem is.  But, uh, what were you saying about STP?  You're at Irving Plaza tomorrow.  Yeah.  Okay.  So this radio station...  Even Jay knows.  This radio station spent the whole weekend teasing.  No, I heard it on K-Rock.  They said they're going to get Irving Plaza.  Well, we spoiled their party. 
[01:43:00]  That's about our show.  I'm just on your side, that's all.  All right, let's take a break, and Billy and Paul will get in here next.  They seem very pissed off at Jay.  We'll get to the bottom of that next.  It's Jay and us.  Opie and Anthony.  Well, you guys are both stupid.  You're like a black eye for all mankind.  I don't think they're very nice people.  The only way I could actually think they were funny was to be on heroin.  Opie and Anthony.  You know, I just like one throw up.  Feel the love.  1027 WNEW.  Anthony, the Vermont Teddy Bear Company.  Oh, yes. 
[01:43:30]  People love these, man.  Vermont Teddy Bear shows you care.  It's not just like sending flowers or something.  And, uh, what do they got now?  Birthdays?  You got a birthday wish you want to send somebody?  Do it with a Vermont Teddy Bear.  New baby.  Wish someone well.  Or Easter's coming up.  How about the little Easter bear, Opie?  Hmm?  Vermont Teddy Bear.  What do you do?  Call 1-800-829-BEAR.  And a friendly bear counselor will help you choose from over 100 handcrafted bears for  any occasion. 
[01:44:00]  You personalize them just for the person.  Your bear counselor helps you out.  If, uh, you say your girl's a nurse, all of a sudden they have a nurse bear.  You could do that.  It's very personal.  Well, and, uh, I'm hearing a brawl outside in the hallway.  This is real, too, man.  What?  Rick, what's going on?  Rick.  What's going on?  Uh, Jay's got to learn to lock the door before, uh, he goes to the bathroom.  Why?  Who just walked in on him?  I did.  Oh.  Is he dumping? 
[01:44:30]  He ain't...  Thank God he's not dumping.  He's not crunching, is he?  No, I walk in and all I see, all I see in the big mirror is his face looking at me like,  whatever you're doing is.  Sorry, Ann.  Vermont teddy bear.  You could choose from bears like the, uh, new baby bear, with a baby's name and birthdate  embroidered on the bib.  Pregnancy bear for someone who's expecting.  For a birthday, personalize a bear with their hobby or occupation.  Uh, a biker bear.  Or for Easter, how about, uh, the hare bear. 
[01:45:00]  That's H-A-R-E, hare.  And, uh, flashback bunny.  Dressed like a hippie.  Dressed like a hippie.  A little hippie bear.  Why not?  Instead of sending flowers, send a beautiful Vermont teddy bear, which will be enjoyed forever.  It really is a good gift.  Uh, the bear counselors, they're ready.  They're standing by.  The whole process takes five minutes, tops.  So if you need a gift for someone, this is a great idea.  Overnight delivery is guaranteed, so call 1-800-829-BEAR or shop online at vermontteddybear.com.  Send a bear gram gift, the creative alternative to sending flowers. 
[01:45:30]  That's 1-800-829-BEAR and tell them Opie and Anthony sent you, okay?  A few more commercials to get through, Ann, and then, uh, Jay Moore.  We'll bring everyone in and sort this out.  And the confrontation, uh, with, uh, Paul and Billy.  Right.  That's more serious than I even, uh, thought, Anthony.  Yeah.  We'll do that next.  Stay there.  You guys have to hear your rating.  It's beyond belief right now.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Thank you.  10-2-7 WNAW. 
[01:46:00]  All right.  Before we get back to Jay Moore, we've got some tickets to give away.  Great show coming to town.  We've got Filter and Veruca Salt playing the Hammerstein Ballroom April 20th.  Can't buy a secede!  Tickets available through Ticketmaster.  Filter puts on a fine show live.  We'll give a pair to the 10th caller right now at 212-757-1027.  We can clear the phone lines as far as the Jay Moore stuff goes for now.  But in the studio, our buddy, our pal, Jay Moore.  How about three tickets to Wednesday at Rascals?  I'll give away, too.  Oh, Jay.  Oh! 
[01:46:30]  Uh, we'll give them away a little later, then.  How's that?  All right.  And Wednesday.  Because I know you're cheap and only have one pair to give away, so we'll spread out the  winning here.  No, I gave four to Paisan, and I gave, uh, I, uh, Corbett and Testaverde are going to  be there winning.  Now, if you give them free tickets, does that mean they can't talk to you?  Is there a deal that has to be struck here?  I just want them to know what they're getting into.  I'm the most affable, approachable guy that probably ever worked in this town.  One guy's in the absolute front row.  You know, right when I get off stage, I got to walk past 400 people. 
[01:47:00]  There's two bouncers on out inside of me, and they're like, here you go, here you go.  And I go to the back room, have a glass of water.  Right.  The guy walks out.  Get away from everyone.  You know, I'm going to send them a headshot.  And you know what?  I'm going to send them, after I go see Stone Temple Pilots at Irving Plaza tomorrow night,  I'm going to send them a Stone Temple Pilots thing also.  That's a coincidence.  Joey's going to send you a headshot also.  Yeah, of me.  There's going to be a horse's headshot in my hotel bed.  I'm actually opening for Stone Temple Pilots at Irving Plaza. 
[01:47:30]  Stone Temple Pilots are going to do an acoustic set tonight.  Stephen Lynch, we had Stephen Lynch last night.  Stephen Lynch will probably be there Wednesday, but we definitely got Corbett and Testa Verdi at RSVP.  So tonight, we don't know what they're doing.  I didn't know they did comedy.  No, they're coming out.  You know how they come up, they wave, and they take questions from the audience.  Anything I can do to kill time.  I get paid by the hours.  With more people to come by to hang out, the better.  We figured that out last time you were at Rascals.  And I did 20 minutes of your set for you.  That girl took her horns out, and then you guys walk off the stage, and I'm only a half hour into my show, 
[01:48:00]  and I'm like, how do I follow breasts?  All right, let's get Billy and Paul in here.  Fat guys.  Billy Hine and Paul Bond from Airsick.net.  They have a problem with Jay Moore.  Airsick Productions.  Airsick.net.  You need chairs.  Which one's the fat guy?  Take a guess.  Uh-oh.  Gee, hard to figure that one out, huh?  Hey, Paul.  Hey, Jay.  What's up, man? 
[01:48:30]  Well, I'm putting a real screwed up position.  First of all, I'm a little pissed with O&A.  What happened?  Well, what happened?  Jesus.  Every time I tell you guys something off the air, it's going to wind up on the air.  That's our show.  Yeah.  We do it all the time.  That's right.  What did you tell us off the air?  What happened?  What did you tell us off the air?  Let's get into it.  I got a problem with Jay.  Right.  And so you've got to bring it up on the air.  Well, I'll tell you why we brought it up on the air. 
[01:49:00]  Because you're not wrecked.  You affected our show one day.  So we're like, what the hell was that about it?  We're pissing ourselves at we didn't say something when Jay was live from L.A. on the phone.  Well, hold on.  How did we wreck the show that day by not saying nothing?  I didn't say it.  You kind of wrecked the segment, that's for sure.  I thought we were...  Oh, it was the day the Amadou Diallo verdict came out.  Ooh, funny died that was.  Wait a minute.  I thought we were more talking about what Billy was saying and had no problem talking about it.  Did we say that you had a problem?  No, I know what they're talking about.  We mentioned the fact they were in here.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  They mentioned the fact when we were doing the Amadou Diallo verdict. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  You know, these guys were in, right?  Mm-hmm.  And they were hanging on the show.  And then Jay, out of nowhere, calls from L.A.  We put him on.  He's making everyone laugh.  And while Jay's making everyone laugh, you guys were sitting there with the same faces you got now with your arms folded.  He wasn't making us laugh.  And that affects my show.  Or our show, I can say.  He wasn't making us laugh.  Why was he making you laugh?  No, he wasn't.  So I was pissed at myself that I had the perfect opportunity to at least confront the issue, 
[01:50:00]  because Jay was from L.A., live from L.A., and you guys obviously had some type of beef with him.  And to be honest, we blew it.  We didn't say anything on the air that day.  So then, yes, we did bring it up on the air.  Yeah, so then you had to drag it up again.  I called up just to make a joke saying it's going to be gay more week, blah, blah, blah.  And then the whole cool chick, I said she changed the name because she didn't want to be Little Ho.  Right.  And then you had to bring the whole thing out about Jay.  But, Paul, in all fairness, at that point, you guys have mentioned it enough that it's time to see what the problem is. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, like nobody else calls up and says gay more, and he's gay, and all that stuff?  Nobody else says that?  Who put that through?  It was that besides the look you gave when Jay was on the phone.  So I'm like, wow, there's obviously a problem here, so let's see what the deal is.  The stock market guy just told me to come down because there was gay guys.  Yeah.  Well, I have a problem.  Actually, and I don't know why you're getting so involved, because it was Billy that finally said on the phone last week that he wanted to confront Jay. 
[01:51:00]  Well, yeah.  You guys are egging us on.  Billy, fat guy, if you're out there, call us, call us, call us.  What, am I supposed to not come?  I'm asking for production.  Yeah, I don't have to.  Yeah, what does that make me look like?  I have a problem, but I ain't coming to face Jay.  Paul, I'm not right to Jay.  Well, I'm confused, because the last time I saw you, I was taking pictures, like, with you and your girlfriend.  And your family, and then you stick your head in, and you're, like, screaming at everybody.  Well, I'm getting, I got pressure from other comedians, all right? 
[01:51:30]  When I was on the show, and I was, you know, you had a perfect opportunity to say something about Jay, and you didn't take the opportunity to say it.  And, quite frankly, I'm nervous about this.  Why would you?  Because I wouldn't say something about you, because I would think we were aligned.  I know, especially when I heard that you said something nice about me on Friday, and I'm like, well,  I know something, you know, I, this sucks, you know that?  This really sucks.  You guys did it to yourself.  Well, we did it to ourselves, all right. 
[01:52:00]  Definitely.  Yeah.  We called ourselves on the air and said, what do you got to say about Jay?  Really, you called in.  You called in.  I know.  All right.  All right.  So you did it to yourself.  And you guys are lumped together.  No, we got no problem being lumped together.  As far as the radio show goes, you guys are lumped together.  You called up, and so now it is a problem.  You're right.  So why did I call up, though?  Why did I call up?  After about a 20-minute conversation with Billy, if you're out there, you got a problem with Jay, call up.  Let's talk about it, blah, blah, blah.  So I call up.  I don't want to talk about it on the air. 
[01:52:30]  I mean, I don't know Jay from a hole in the wall.  He don't know me.  But it's not right to do it over the radio when you can't rebut and you can't answer to yourself or whatever.  All I know is there's a problem.  You guys have a problem with Jay.  Well, he's got a problem, too, sitting outside for two hours waiting to friggin' come in here.  You know, we call up.  Yes, they say, be here at 3 o'clock.  Here it is, 5 o'clock now.  Jay walks in.  Boom, right on the air.  Right in.  Screw the air stick, guys.  Let's go sit up.  Yeah.  That's funny.  Yeah, I'm asking.  Who did you know before?  Huh?  Who did you know before?  Jay or I?  Yeah, that's right.  Oh, yeah.  I wouldn't have a show yet.  In my defense, I'm pretty far from a Hollywood guy, a fat guy. 
[01:53:00]  Come on.  I'm from Jersey, for crying out loud.  But, you know, no, it's just, we do stuff for you guys, and it's like, you know what?  Oh, but look, here's somebody better.  Screw you guys.  We're going to take the next guy.  So, it's like, you know.  Screw you.  I think you guys have gotten a ton of air time on our show.  More than any other radio show in the country, I would guarantee that.  You're the only guys we work for for free, too.  Whatever.  Yeah.  They pay me.  We don't need to pay you guys. 
[01:53:30]  We don't need to pay Jay more.  It's a barter thing, pretty much.  I know that.  You give us good songs that we play on the air.  Yeah, I know that.  And we give you plugs.  It's like a one-hand one.  I know that.  I'm just pissed off that I'm in this position right now.  Let me just put my cards in on it.  The two of you, I know you were Air Sick Productions.  You two are Air Sick Productions.  Right.  Okay.  We're both Air Sick Productions.  Okay.  By the way, who are all these people with you?  What do you know?  They have these guys work here.  This is my friend, Billy.  That's Dina Cola.  Oh, that's Dina Cola.  Yeah. 
[01:54:00]  The one-song wonder.  Oh, man.  Dina Cola wrestled at Wisconsin.  I'd be careful.  Well, I don't know.  I don't think the weights match up.  I think you guys would be in different weight classes.  I mean, this is one of the things.  You come on and like, oh, Dina Cola, Dina Cola, he's the greatest thing since sliced bread.  They've got to write one friggin' song.  You take credit for starting the whole contest.  It's a whole-blown age.  It isn't just one song.  Yeah, it is.  It's one song.  That's like the free bird of six songs.  What are you talking about?  In your opinion?  In my opinion.  Steven Lynch was on stage last night. 
[01:54:30]  He had to stay.  We gave the guy credit.  He started the most offensive song contest.  We're not talking about that with you guys.  We're talking about when Jay calls up.  It's always like, oh, you know, Mike Dina Cola, Mike Dina Cola, Mike Dina Cola.  So he's plugging a friend.  Where's the problem next?  Mike, Mike.  Mike.  There's a microphone over here.  Mike.  Mike, radio.  You've got to use a mic.  Mike was doing shots of blackouts last night.  Huh?  I said, I'm talking to you.  Okay.  You're slamming a bit.  That doesn't make...  I'm slamming the fact that we've got to bust our ass when we come in here to try to...  Oh, I mean...  Oh, I'm sorry.  Jay, don't stop short. 
[01:55:00]  Dina Cola's going to go up your ass.  Yeah.  Jay, how's your career just lacking yourself onto somebody?  Pardon me?  What?  Oh, my God.  How's your career just lacking yourself onto somebody following around the country like a little bitch?  Uh, and first of all, I was just at the Tempe Improv.  He was not with me in D.C., Tempe.  Mm-hmm.  This is...  I'm in a unique position to pick who I want to open for me.  And if you had...  If you were headlining a room, wouldn't you want Paul to open for you because he's your friend?  Yeah, probably.  And when I was at Rascals, I...  I mean, when I canceled Caroline's, I...  You know, that was... 
[01:55:30]  Dina Cola was on his own.  It was Colin Quinn, for crying out loud.  Mm-hmm.  Is he latching onto Colin Quinn?  It's called a middle act.  You work more than the headliners do.  Yeah, but would he be here if it wasn't for you?  No.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Okay.  Absolutely not.  And would anybody know...  It was an opportunity.  So, it was an opportunity.  But I got to tell you...  I got brought in by Jay.  I got to tell you, though, now that he has been brought in, he has carte blanche to come  in when he wants.  He's proven himself to be, like, a funny guy.  He took advantage of his opportunity and came up with something that everyone's talking  about.  Okay, so basically you're saying... 
[01:56:00]  If someone that sucks comes in here with De Niro, it doesn't matter.  We're not going to have him in if he isn't entertaining.  Oh, I see.  So, the basic thing is the guy...  We're getting way off track here.  We're getting way off track.  The problem is there are things that Jay says on the air that aren't his.  Never have and never will be.  And he uses them in his act and it's bringing people into clubs.  All right?  Under false pretenses.  And you guys know about it.  Wait a minute.  And I've been told by other comics, why don't you say something to him? 
[01:56:30]  You have the opportunity.  What bits?  Well, just tell us which bits of yours first to make it easier.  Wait a minute.  Do the following words...  Do the following words ring a bell with you at all?  Leather Cheerio.  Starfish.  Whale's Eye.  Red Fireman's here.  Hold on, hold on.  Whale's Eye.  Whale's Eye is ours.  That's theirs.  That's all from here.  The Whale's Eye is ours.  That's all from them when they did this lady on the phone.  I got the Whale's Eye and the Blue Knot from my brother.  The phone sex lady called me.  Remember?  You guys had me on the phone with the phone sex.  That was all her stuff. 
[01:57:00]  Mm-hmm.  Oh, you know, guess where your brother probably got it from then?  None of this is original.  It's from a CD or a tape almost 10 years old.  Right.  Otto and George.  Otto and George say starfish, yeah.  Yeah.  You got a quote.  No, they say leather cheerio.  They say Red Fireman.  He said Red Fireman's cap.  He's got oil.  When you got...  Hold on, let's wait.  Let's slow down.  Now, Otto and George have patented...  The head of a penis looks like a fireman's hat.  No, but they...  No, but Otto and George call now.  He gets...  No, I've never heard that.  Hold on.  He gets laughs. 
[01:57:30]  Time out.  No one comes on the radio, though, and say,  Oh, Jay Moore, the map of Hawaii, his bit.  That ain't your bit.  You're getting credit for it,  and you're walking around the studio.  Oh, yeah, my map of Hawaii.  That ain't yours,  and you're taking full credit for it  knowing it ain't yours.  Whose map of...  Who did map of Hawaii?  Oh, please.  You don't know, right?  So you don't know.  I said it right here.  Yeah, but you don't know where it came from, do you?  My manager used to tell me,  Matt, but it came in Ireland.  So someone stole it from my manager,  and then I stole it back?  Yeah.  You're friends with Otto and George.  Don't play dumb.  I pump Otto and George up every time I'm here.  Yeah, but anything...  Otto and George get more air time 
[01:58:00]  because of me than themselves.  You guys at home talking to a puppet.  I'm here saying,  I come on in Ireland.  I say he's the funniest guy that ever lived.  You guys got to...  Yeah, and obviously you're using his material.  The word starfish?  You know what?  You come up with an expression in your rack.  You said bits.  Well, yeah,  because it's part of bits that he does.  Now you're taking away...  No, no.  Absolutely.  Yes, right.  That makes it an essential part of the friggin' bit.  It's not a small part. 
[01:58:30]  It's called hack.  No.  And you're doing it on the air!  First of all, I'm a hack.  I'm not going to deny the fact that I'm a hack.  You're a hack.  I am a hack.  Well, good,  because Jeffrey Ross would appreciate that.  Because he's a hack also?  No, because you've...  You're friggin' steal from him, too.  Oh, now you're...  What are you...  Wow.  What?  What are you talking about?  Wow.  What do I steal from Jeffrey Ross?  This is...  On the air!  We're listening to you on the air, Jay.  Let's get Jeff Ross on the phone.  You've said stuff about...  All right.  Now you're going to deny you didn't say anything of... 
[01:59:00]  Any...  You mentioned one time when you did a Jeffrey Ross bit.  I said, oh, this is great.  As long as he gives a little footnote, oh, that's Jeff Ross.  If I say to guys, I go, that's not mine.  That's Jeff Ross's.  Right.  But how about the times?  Oh, shut up that crap.  Shut that crap up.  Unless you want to hit the dumb button, turn that...  Shut up, Paul.  No.  No.  Did you ask me to come over in? 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  I've got to make this entertainment in some form.  All right.  Whatever.  Go ahead.  You want to come in here?  You want to come in here?  Hey, Glenn, what's up?  Now you're getting...  Hey, what's up?  What's up, Glenn?  Go over it, you stupid ass.  Bunch of little pussies.  Get them out of the way.  Yeah, right, right.  Cry, baby.  Yeah, right.  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  Cry, baby.  Join me between the caller and McDonald's.  Yeah.  Take it easy, guys.  Wow.  Oh, man.  You need to call me again.  What is your beef with me?  Hmm?  What is the problem with me?  What is your problem with me? 
[02:00:00]  You know what?  It's amazing.  You've got now carte blanche to come in here.  Yeah.  Why?  Why?  Well, a lot of people...  Oh, you're out of the song.  Oh, are you friggin' proud of yourself?  You wrote one friggin' song.  Oh.  I guess it's got to start.  You know what?  You know what?  It's 1976, and late Leo Sayer had, you make me feel like Hanson.  That's a one-hit one.  No.  Wait a minute.  And he was gay, too.  Yeah, he was gay, too.  Gay?  No, you're not gay.  Hold on. 
[02:00:30]  Jay, you stole that.  Hold on.  The reason my ass is in here...  Leo Sayer, that song which I wrote, by the way, and he stole from me.  That means I don't know what George wants to wrote it first.  Jay, the reason I'm here...  See, I wasn't going to say crap, all right?  But then...  What do you mean you weren't going to say crap?  Who was that?  Huh?  Did you hear something?  Yeah.  There's a fly on a wall.  Oh, my God.  No, I'm listening to this show.  No, waiting back for a minute or something.  I am stunned at the problem you have with Dina Cole.  No, hold on.  Hey, that's taking him way too far. 
[02:01:00]  What the guy...  What has he done to you?  How much did we have to do for you guys to get into the studio?  Let's rewind.  Well, you sent some songs, and then you guys can come in and plug stuff and play songs,  and we get entertaining and songs.  The best thing since sliced bread, because your star friend is pushing his ass.  Why do you care as long as you have one freaking star friend, and you're going to bleed it to death?  No, as long as you have your input into this show, why do you care what else happens on this show? 
[02:01:30]  Why?  Because not only are we part of the show, we're fans of the show.  Okay?  And I don't like the way he treats you guys sometimes.  You know what?  And you guys don't even freaking realize it.  You don't even realize it.  I've been a good donut pumping these guys out.  No, on the show.  On the show.  When Buddy Hacker was on, God bless him.  I love Buddy Hacker.  Yeah?  You're doing...  Guess what's in her pants, all right?  After Buddy Hacker hangs up the phone...  Which is the Jay Moore original, by the way.  Okay, great.  Well, that's one in a row.  Okay, here's one.  Listen to me.  After Hacker hangs up... 
[02:02:00]  Buddy Hacker, excuse me, he's your friend, not mine.  You're going to Hacker.  Okay?  After he hangs up the phone, Anthony cracks the joke.  And if you turn to Anthony on the end and go, oh, what are you going to fill Buddy Hacker's shoes?  Don't try to fill Hacker's shoes.  Don't try to fill Hacker's shoes.  I don't remember that.  And this stuff goes right over your head, man.  It's like you don't remember stealing from Otto and George either.  We allow people to abuse us.  That's what I'm saying.  That's not the point.  Wait, wait, wait.  Let's go with it.  Like, you guys haven't gotten good lines at our expense, man?  Have we ever...  No, no, no.  It's coming from somewhere else. 
[02:02:30]  Trust me.  I do an hour and a half when I'm on stage, and I would like to go through...  Let's go through a set list, all right?  See, I don't live in L.A., so I don't know what's yours and what's not.  Come to the show tonight with a freaking notebook and a piece of paper.  Hershey J.  I saw a guy at the airport.  A rat-wing cow.  I do the story about getting raped by a dolphin for 15 minutes.  Probably a guy dolphin.  Yeah, it was a guy that was a stripper.  Hence the rape.  Yeah, I got raped by a female dolphin, Einstein.  Oh, there's two.  Okay, then we got... 
[02:03:00]  What else have we got?  We got the musket joke.  We got the whole Montel Williams.  We got Oprah Winfrey.  We got that.  Wow, it makes it sound like something I want to come see.  But, hey...  Oh, wow.  Billy, Billy...  It was funny.  I'm not going to say...  I mean, I'm not going to...  But when you take an hour and a half set and say the word starfish...  Oh, my God, stop the press.  Jay Moore said the word starfish.  No, no, I'm talking about on the air.  You talk on the air like it's your stuff.  And you don't footnote anything after a while.  People don't listen later on. 
[02:03:30]  People don't listen later on.  I footnote Jeff Ross.  You just said that.  You did it once.  Watch the language.  What if you do it once you kill it for a day after that?  What are you talking about?  I just said...  You just said that.  Watch the language.  Watch the F word.  You know, I think starfish was used way before Otto and George.  You know how long Otto's been at this?  And you know how long...  Do you have any freaking idea?  Before he was in it, that's for damn sure.  And before you were on the air.  You know how many times I called Otto...  13 years old that freaking guy started. 
[02:04:00]  You know how many times I called Otto at home and I say,  please come to Rascals and do a set because I'd love for you to be my guest.  When I come on this show and I say,  Otto and George are the funniest person that ever lived.  I got...  Oh, excuse me.  I got Otto and George on the freaking show Action.  I got him in a goddamn Hollywood TV show.  So who's Hollywood?  Because I love them.  Who's not Hollywood?  Yeah.  Me?  Yeah.  Who's not thin?  Did it ever air?  Who's not hetero?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Look around the room.  I know I am.  Before we move on to that, 
[02:04:30]  Pimp Hand.  Where did that come from?  Pin Pimp Hand.  Oh, Anthony, I taught you everything you know about Pimp Hand.  Anthony's never gotten a bra or gotten wowed before Jay Moore walked in the studio.  And Anthony's...  Oh, dude.  Anthony makes me...  Oh, oh, oh.  That's obviously a joke.  Wait a minute.  You're stretching.  You're stretching.  Anthony makes...  I wish you guys weren't on goddamn vacation  because I would have had Vic cut this crap up on a thing  and you would have played it. 
[02:05:00]  You know, on a second, listen,  it does sound like he's accusing me of not being able to do what I do,  which is be funny and get the girls' tops off before he got into goddamn place.  Boy, you're stretching, man.  Hold on.  And then Anthony says something and Jay goes,  hey, I'll be the funny one here.  Yeah, I'll be the funny one.  Oh, excuse me.  Gee, is it the O.P., Anthony, and Jay show?  No, it's the O.P. and Anthony show.  They were funny before you.  They'll be funny after you.  I agree.  You take credit for all of that.  Oh, my God.  I don't think I've ever said that to Anthony or O.P.  Yeah, yeah.  I think...  Jay, I'll tell you what.  Have you ever been saying that to you ever?  Like, I'll be the funny one for Lex? 
[02:05:30]  I don't even...  If you do say it, I don't even care.  And, yeah, that's the big thing.  I swear to God, we don't even care.  It doesn't matter.  We've been abused by every guest we've had on this show.  And you all give it back.  And you give it back.  And you have never given it back to him.  Oh, my God.  I'm not supposed to come, man.  How many times are you doing here?  Don't beat him.  Are you listening to the show when you first came in here?  Oh, Gary Markle.  That's a good one.  You know why?  What's the deal with you?  You can get gay Markle off on the air, all right?  Then you draw a little circle around his butt, all right? 
[02:06:00]  Then you show your ass to Stephen Lennon, right?  Then you walk in here and you show your swan to Opie and Anthony.  But wait a minute.  But wait a minute.  That's a heavy sound.  Wait a minute.  I'm telling him.  Wait a minute.  Oh, Jay, they cut it.  See, Jay says cut it.  They cut it.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  See?  I'm still a bad guy.  That's the freaking difference.  I'm doing something for you, and I'm a bad guy.  You're an ungrateful prick.  Yeah, maybe I am.  But wait a minute.  But David, come on.  You called him up.  When you did your West Orange show, and he said, oh, gay Marko's here. 
[02:06:30]  And you said, oh, I nearly turned around and punched him if he came up on stage.  I'm like, it's either you're gay or you're a gay basher.  You can't be both.  I'm not a gay basher if I hate fans.  Yeah, but it's just, you know something?  I think you're taking everything literally that happens on this show.  You never hang out with guys and goof on them and just joke with each other and take a line 
[02:07:00]  that you've heard somewhere else and go and throw it into the conversation.  We don't make a living out of it.  Yeah, yeah.  We don't big people to come to the show.  Seeing what he's done, when we went to Rascals, I've seen a lot of comics in my day.  I don't think I've ever seen what he was doing coming out of another comic's mouth.  Where do you live?  And I was from Long Island.  Right.  So let me tell you.  Right.  So what's going on in Hollywood?  Do you ever hear of the term American Top 40? 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, I can't.  It's a comic term.  It means guys who go on the road, steal all the crap from wherever they are and wherever they go  so you can use it on the road.  Guys that go on the road?  I play five rooms twice a year.  I do.  Gee, then I guess all those plugs were unnecessary.  Joe, what's going on?  Wow.  Yeah, these guys are mirror sick.  They sound like jilted lovers.  Little crybaby jealous bitches.  Get them off already.  Get it off your chest.  Well, you sound like, you know what?  We were here first today.  You said somebody's better.  We're funnier.  You know what? 
[02:08:00]  I'm defending Opie and Anthony and you're sitting there.  No, no, no, no.  Don't.  We don't want to be defended.  We don't want to be defended.  I told you that.  Not once maybe would you say something.  We don't have to.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We're sitting out there for two hours and they're going, oh, you know, the answer guys  have a problem with you.  I don't know what their problem is.  You're funny.  You know what?  Back us into a frigging corner.  Not once do you say anything like, oh, you know, maybe they do have a point.  Let me tell you something.  We said you guys are burning yourself because you do sound really jealous.  Well, OK, maybe we do sound.  You want to see the phones you think we're just picking?  You want to see all the emails and the message boards I got? 
[02:08:30]  Whatever.  You guys are right for Steve's web page?  Whatever.  I still want to go through my set list.  There's 10 calls on hold and not one is in favor of you guys.  Let's do an hour and 15 hours.  You guys are burning yourself.  Don't blame us for burning you.  Well, we blame you for never sticking up for us.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Because I don't agree with your beef with Jay.  Who did I steal the 10-minute walk-in bet from?  Walk-in.  Walk-in.  Who did I steal that from?  Musket.  Who did I steal that from?  Who did I steal the stuff from? 
[02:09:00]  I am not saying...  Women getting ready...  Jay, I'm not saying...  Women getting ready for bed.  No, you know what?  I respect you a little bit more.  You just said, you know what?  You sat here...  I think Barnes is on stage...  Paul at least is like calling me out.  You sat there like...  You talk about Dina Kola ramming up my ass.  You sat there like a little buddy on Welcome Back, Connor, like Charles Fleischer next to the black guy.  You've said nothing.  You've sat there the whole time.  You've got no beef.  You've got no leg to stand on.  Paul is actually calling me out.  You're just a freaking baby.  Shut your freaking mouth.  Because at least Paul is talking to me.  Hey, you don't want to do that. 
[02:09:30]  What are you going to do?  You going to get up?  Hey, hey, no brawling.  No brawling.  No brawling.  Keep it.  No brawling.  You're freaking easy.  Hey, hey.  Back it up, back it up.  Back it up.  Easy.  Come on.  Hey, be cool.  Be cool.  Hey, be cool.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hey, hey.  Hey, hey.  Chill.  Hey, hey.  Get back to my radio.  Get back to my radio.  Get back to my radio.  What's the way?  He wants to act?  We're lost the way. 
[02:10:00]  We're lost the way.  We're in the handling right now.  We were off the air.  Yes.  No way.  Good.  Opie and Anthony.  We found a girl that could shoot stuff from a private area.  More stupidity on the way.  1027 WNEW.  Hey, Anthony.  That's a sword.  We're back on the air here.  That guy right on his ass.  Anthony.  Oh, my God.  Bring him in. 
[02:10:30]  We have...  Wait, wait, wait.  Okay, got to explain to the listeners what happened.  We ran out of delay, and then we had a melee trying to keep that guy and Jay apart.  Everyone separated, so they went into a Van Halen, I heard.  Why didn't you let us fight?  I wasn't there, Jay.  All those guys didn't let you fight.  You were there.  Everyone stood between us.  You can't fight in here.  We can wrestle, but that would have been...  I thought of you in here.  That was wrestling.  We weren't... 
[02:11:00]  That guy got out of here.  We didn't hate each other.  That guy got out of his chair.  That fat bastard.  That 350-pound troll got out of his chair.  Bring him back in, Rick.  Yeah, we're coming in.  Bring him back in.  Let's fight.  Let's fight on here.  I smell pay-per-view.  Let's have a fight on here.  No, the problem with this whole scenario, Jay, is that they're not saying crap in our defense.  Because I don't want to.  Because you're wrong.  You're wrong, Paul.  Paul, you are wrong.  You are wrong.  If you were a goddamn comic, Opie, you would understand that when you steal material and  you go on stage, it's wrong. 
[02:11:30]  That's not going to hurt me, Paul.  And in the community, that is wrong.  Paul, when you say nobody sticks up for you or takes your side, no one has confronted you  with anything on our show.  You've come in.  I'm going to call you guys on something right now.  We've done...  Okay.  How about when you guys were on the air, and he went, oh, Jay Moore, one whole more  week of Jay Moore.  That's a joke.  You're joking.  That's a joke.  You say we don't stick up ourselves.  That's a joke.  What did I just say?  What did I just say?  When he walked in, I was goofing on how he did. 
[02:12:00]  The first thing we said when he walked in was the gay stuff.  And did Nopi say, oh, welcome to the Jay Moore plug.  We'll get to the Jay Moore plug after this.  That's all joking.  Like, I can take it when he attacks us, and he can take it when we attack him.  Because we know it's not.  But for you guys, it's real for some reason.  We've got conversations off the air where you're...  That is not true.  I am not even going to allow...  I'll let you call with that.  You just said...  That's BS.  That's BS.  That's BS.  That's BS.  How come when you say something, it's not all right?  Dad.  Dad.  Like what? 
[02:12:30]  Oh, I can't take it.  I don't know if I can take it another whole week of gay more.  That's not true.  You lying sack.  Not true.  Sorry.  God bless you, Ovi.  That's not true.  Terrific.  I just noticed something.  Jay, let me see 100 this morning.  Huh?  This is the best show, the only show ever.  Yeah, the only show on the air this morning.  Who cares if he did Z-100?  You did Z-100 last year.  How two-faced are you guys then?  I don't care.  I did Z-100 this morning.  Why don't you check your facts first?  Oh, yeah?  How come when I was on the phone?  They sent me emails over there that said you did Z-100.  Oh, you were supposed to?  Did you not show up? 
[02:13:00]  I didn't do it.  You were supposed to, right?  Yeah, I was supposed to.  So whatever?  All right.  Okay.  The only show on the air is...  I noticed you were in the studio a good ten minutes before you would even look me in the eye.  Are you scared of me?  Please.  Yeah, what?  Please, Jay.  Oh, yeah.  I'm scared of you.  Please don't go there, dude.  I'll eat you up and spit you out so fast you don't even know what happened to you.  The only good thing about you is your talk.  You talk a good game.  Talk?  Yeah, you talk a good game.  I want three animals to get to you.  What are you talking about?  I don't remember.  This guy's still out of breath.  He didn't get me.  He didn't get me.  There's six people between us.  Get rid of them.  Get rid of them.  We were keeping you guys apart. 
[02:13:30]  We were keeping you guys apart.  These guys work here, you man.  Oh, yeah.  These guys do not work here.  You brought them in with you.  Get rid of them.  You're a big man.  He was holding me back.  He was holding me back.  Okay, so let's get this point.  Who are the two big guys who came in with you?  The two cops or something?  We can't have you two killing each other.  They came in before anything happened.  This is Billy A.  They came in before anything happened.  So what?  You can't stick up for yourself?  You need boys with you?  How many times have these guys been in here with me?  Every time.  Jay, you're a pussy.  Every time.  Admit it.  Every time.  You don't admit to stealing.  You've got to bring guys in with you.  Get rid of them.  Be a man for once, for Christ's sake. 
[02:14:00]  Will you leave the room, please, Billy?  Will you please leave the room?  Will you both leave the room?  We can't have you two beating the crap out of each other.  It's not going to be out of each other.  Now all of a sudden we have restrictions as to what's okay and what's not okay.  It's never been okay for anybody to kill each other in this studio.  There's been freaking fight clubs in here before, but that's wrestling.  Not people that hate each other.  You guys don't hear the same thing.  You don't think you're a dick.  I'm really fighting and trying to kill someone.  It was called a wrestling match.  There's no hatred where someone's going to kill someone. 
[02:14:30]  There's no hatred.  Do you wrestle?  I'll wrestle.  Come on.  I'm not going to wrestle.  I'm punching the mouth.  Come on.  Let's go.  Nah, you won't wrestle, right?  Come on.  You won't wrestle.  You can't have that.  I won't wrestle.  I won't wrestle a lot.  Boy, my agent called.  I can't afford to hurt my face.  You know, you piss it.  You know, you're living under freaking laurels.  I'll let you hit me first.  Huh?  I'll let you hit me first.  Okay, then it's over.  Then what?  It's going to be over?  It's going to be over.  Oh, yeah.  Let's do it.  Come on.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, look, look, look.  The two guys that are with me will leave the room.  JJ.  So that none of my posily boys that I brought that come with me, Dina Cole, you leave the 
[02:15:00]  room, you leave the room.  So anything that happens is an ONA or somebody you brought to separate.  That's no problem.  Don't hit him first.  Yeah, all I need is another freaking lawsuit.  Don't hit him first.  That's all I freaking need.  More litigation.  I got no money as it is.  Wait, now, now, if he or you die and the lawsuits come in to Opie and Anthony, I'm F, I'm not,  I can't afford to have you two kill each other. 
[02:15:30]  I can't afford it.  Hey, Fat Guy, all I know is when I was loading up my right, there was a lot more than those  two guys between us, pal.  Oh, okay.  You know what?  You talk so good.  Yeah.  You really talk a good game, Jed.  Look, look, look, look.  If you want to kill each other, bounce fast.  Does he work for me?  Can I bring him?  Can I bring him?  Yeah, I'll bring him.  You want to sign a release that says, uh...  Jay, you're the best backskater in the league, baby.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, let me at him.  Let me at him.  But guys, don't let go. 
[02:16:00]  You faggot pussy.  Oh, my God.  You are.  You're a nothing, Jay.  You're a laughingstock.  You see what I'm not saying.  You know what?  How many people would have been around for this last night?  If not for this show?  Probably half as many.  Keep going.  Half.  And the point?  Yeah.  And the point?  The point is, you know what?  He comes in.  He gives us good radio.  He gets plugs in return.  And what do we give you?  What do we give you?  We've made you guys a little bigger.  What a friggin' plug we do.  You bust our chops and we come in and say, we got a gig this week.  And you're like, oh, all you come in here to do is plug. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, ho, ho.  Jay walks in the first time.  You get nothing in return, do you?  We get nothing in return.  We say that to everyone when we plug it.  This is a big thing.  We make fun of him when he plugs.  But you don't forget, but you give the plugs, don't you?  How come everybody's stopping me from coming to you if I'm such a backpedaling?  Joey, what's up?  Hey, fat guy, fat guy, fat guy.  I have one thing to say.  I have one thing to say.  Anthony's brother Joe.  I'm Anthony's brother.  I'm Anthony's brother Joe.  Pleased to meet you, everybody.  Pleased to meet everybody here. 
[02:17:00]  Listen to me.  Listen to me for one minute.  I've been working with Anthony and Opie for probably going on six years.  From day one, writing parodies, writing bits, working with them a lot.  Okay.  I never, I never once pissed and moaned and bitched about not being able to come in when I want, on my terms, how I want to come in.  When I heard you the other day, man, it really did turn my stomach.  I'm not taking Jay's side.  Okay.  I'm not taking Jay's side.  I'm speaking, I'm speaking the thoughts of most of the people that are listening to you right now. 
[02:17:30]  Okay.  I never pissed and moaned the way you guys are.  Okay, but how do you know that?  I mean, how do you know that you're speaking the thoughts of all the people who are listening to you?  Just look at the phone calls.  Look at everything coming in.  Look at the facts.  It's not an opinion.  It's a fact, man.  It's a fact.  The problem here.  The problem here is you guys will.  Jay, what are you so upset about?  Are you upset because this is the truth?  What are you so upset about?  We're not upset.  Shut up, Paul.  What are you so upset about?  That's why I'm upset.  I want to know what Jay's so upset about.  Right now I'm upset because I couldn't get to you. 
[02:18:00]  When you got out of here.  No, but what got you so upset you want to get to me?  What?  Because you can't handle the truth, Jay?  Because you got out of your chair and came towards me, my friend.  You don't like being told that you're a phony and a fake and a thief?  No, it's fine.  That's fine.  Yeah, it's fine.  Words and words.  Then what are you so pissed off?  Let him fall.  Let him fall.  My fingertips to my shoulder belongs to me.  When you were talking, I didn't care.  You came out of that chair, took off your headset, and you started coming towards me.  And I'm not going to sit in a chair and get blasted by some fat bastard.  I got out of the chair to meet you halfway like a man.  And then we got broken up.  I've twice since then tried to come over there to play. 
[02:18:30]  I noticed something.  You called me a back peddler.  You just stayed there.  Jay, yeah.  No one's stopping you from coming to me.  I am standing here.  Six people stopping me from coming to you.  Six people and now we're really making...  It's really...  One, two, you know, the...  Everyone's stopping, Jay.  You're so big.  This is really working out well.  You're a little pissant.  This really worked out well for us, open ant.  Yeah, thanks for sticking up for it, guys.  We really appreciate it.  We're sticking up.  You guys buried yourself.  Whatever.  I'm in rascal sign, everybody, at 830.  Right on earth. 
[02:19:00]  Please.  Let the fat guy...  Why don't you plug your...  No doubt.  Why don't you plug your broken jaw, you fat ass?  And you know where the exit is to the bedroom.  Hey, fat ass, it's right here, dickhead.  All right.  Come on.  Oh, man.  They're going to slap him like a bitch.  He talks like a bitch.  Hey, hey, hey.  We can't have people killing each other.  Okay.  There goes Jay.  There goes Jay. 
[02:19:30]  I feel like Jay.  I feel like Jay.  I feel like Jay.  I feel like Jay.  Yeah, no bloodshed.  Holy smoke.  This is like...  Maybe you're going to play my parodies.  You got more meat in this room.  You guys said...  You guys knew this was going to happen.  Jay.  Jay.  No effing way.  You got eight freaking bodyguards in here.  No effing way.  You got eight freaking guys in here.  They're going to keep me from knocking that guy in his ass.  They're going to be yours, Zach.  They are in here for that.  I swear to God we didn't know this was going to happen. 
[02:20:00]  Hey, you know where Rascals is.  And you know where each entrance is.  You wait for me.  Why not?  I swear to God.  Before...  Before...  Before...  But because I got to go to work.  Because people...  Wait for me outside the studio.  I'll be outside the studio in about an hour.  Wait for me outside the...  Look how he yells when there's six people between us.  Get out of the way.  I'm going to yell.  I'm not...  Have I gone to one in...  I didn't do my work.  Who are you?  If someone gets killed, we're...  We're screwed. 
[02:20:30]  So we can't have that happen.  How am I this?  Do you understand why...  I mean, if someone gets killed in here, we are screwed.  They're just going to get beaten.  That's what I'm saying.  I can't afford that.  It's got to really affect the world.  I can't afford that.  Listen, you know where the entrance and the exit to the studio is.  If you want to leave and wait for me, wait for me.  What did I just tell you?  Brooklyn Diner.  Do you need me to write it down for you?  And that's stupid enough.  You know where I live.  We're walking right past it.  Well, Brooklyn Diner, right out in front of the studio, Mr. Tough Guy.  I got to walk right past it.  Maybe there'll be no cameras and no microphones on. 
[02:21:00]  You're going to tuck it between your legs and run or what?  Yeah, that's what I'm going to do.  Oh, no, I'm not going to go with the fat guy.  You're all freaking talk.  You are all talk, Jay.  Why don't you admit it?  Why don't you just come see...  You know what?  Everything we've said here has been true, and you're denying, denying, hold on.  I use the word starfish on stage, therefore I steal a half of material.  You're a thief, you're freaking, you know it.  I'm a thief?  You're a thief.  You're afraid of me.  Hold on.  You're afraid of me.  We got it on film.  Little baby, I came at you four times. 
[02:21:30]  How am I afraid of you, puss?  But you didn't get...  How am I afraid of you?  All right.  And this guy, Rick.  The problem here is that I make a general statement about things being said that come  out of your mouth in here that aren't yours...  You're a freaking guitar act.  Oh, that...  Oh, now, okay.  All right.  All right.  You're the most original guy.  Now we're going to go there.  All right.  At least you wrote it.  I wrote the damn thing.  That's the freaking difference, Moore.  I wrote it.  Go.  The English guy. 
[02:22:00]  I can go through my whole act when I wrote.  Yeah, this is not the author.  No, I'm talking about when you're in here when everyone thinks you're such a freaking genius  on the air.  And I go, oh, I can't.  That's Jeff Ross's, actually.  You took props.  It's incredible.  But then you stopped doing that.  When you stopped doing that, the listeners, I like to believe it's your stuff.  I said Jordan Rubin today.  I said Jordan Rubin's name today.  Okay.  Today I said it.  Okay.  That's one in a row again.  We've got an entertaining radio, and we've given plugs out. 
[02:22:30]  That's it.  Isn't that the bottom line?  What did we plug?  What did we plug?  Let's plug.  Nothing.  You guys have never plugged it off my mic.  We plug a goddamn thing.  I'm talking about whenever you guys have come in.  No, no, no.  No.  Yeah, now I'm going to plug when everyone thinks we're a bunch of pusses because O&A aren't  sticking up or saying anything.  And I'm different.  You don't think it's wrong.  No, wait a minute.  We didn't have a problem with you until today.  Now I definitely have a problem with you guys. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, now you have a problem.  Yes, I do, Paul.  We walk in every week.  We hand you a CD, and we say we're doing a show.  Oh, another plug.  Yeah.  You make us feel like that.  We say it's my own brother.  We say it's a joke.  Yeah, but he gets it.  Take him a water.  Is there more water for everybody?  I know the fat guy needs water.  Jay.  Jesus.  Stop what?  That's over the line?  No, stop.  What do you mean stop?  No, this is when you do it.  This is when we hash it out. 
[02:23:30]  You don't stop now.  The point is...  Oh, that's over the line.  No, it's not over the friggin' long.  Oh, yeah.  Jay, I have water crap.  Mike.  What?  Mike, I don't have a problem with you.  Okay, fine.  He does.  He's basically calling me a fag to my face.  That was Jay.  I didn't call you a fag.  All right.  Whatever.  Oh, that's right.  You slanted my song.  It must all make the pyramid for me is enough.  You see, this just really worked out well for us, Billy.  I'm glad ONA dragged it out.  Good radio.  I'm glad they're able to...  Take whatever we say, walk all over it, and backpedal, and a friggin' air stick doesn't 
[02:24:00]  mean crap to them anymore.  Oh, were you upstairs with Mulcahy's with us after the road show?  When we were sitting talking?  Were you there?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I thought maybe I was alone in hearing stuff that.  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess you are.  All of a sudden, it didn't happen.  Yep.  Paul, I get off the plane Friday.  I call...  I didn't hear anything in reporting.  The first thing I do, I get off the plane Friday, and I call them and tell them that someone  was chanting their stuff out in Arizona.  And they go, hey, these guys got a problem with you.  And I go, I don't know who the fat guy is.  They go, it's Paul's partner.  I go, oh, Paul's great.  There's nothing...  They go, Paul, open for you at the shore.  I go, well, there's nothing opener about Paul Bond. 
[02:24:30]  I didn't know you had a problem with me.  I did nothing but pump you up.  I go, Paul Bond's a headliner.  When we...  The first show we had at Rascals, you introduced me, and I whispered in your ear as you walk  off state.  I said, I have no idea why the hell you're opening for anybody.  Do you remember that?  Yes.  Oh, now you're a nice guy.  No, no, I'm not...  I said on the air, I had trouble falling.  Well, I did crack a lot of the comics and say, you have the opportunity to go on the  show and say to everybody that Jay steals on the air.  So who made you the comedy police? 
[02:25:00]  Who made you the guy to...  Well, maybe my conscience got to me, dude.  Well, yeah, all right, your conscience.  What kind of my conscience?  What?  Huh?  People, what, a conscience is funny to you?  I have loyalty to my friends, which obviously doesn't matter who's got it, doesn't matter  who's got it.  Is he going around every...  Maybe he's the only one who has it.  It was that, it was that, plus, it was, no, Mike, it was that person, plus what I thought  was he was trapping on them after a while.  It's the Jay Moore show, and I'm sorry, Buddy Hackett hung up the phone, and Anthony can't 
[02:25:30]  be as funny as Buddy Hackett, your big star buddy.  None of us can.  None of us can.  I know, so you turned to Anthony and you didn't make him feel, well, he didn't feel  it because you know why?  He's so encapsulated by you being such a freaking star.  I don't know, I'm still trying to figure out all the bitches.  What?  I'm still trying to figure out all the bitches.  I'm still trying to figure out all the bitches.  I'm still trying to figure out all the bitches.  Starstruck.  That's the difference between him and us, pal.  No, no, it comes down to jealousy.  Let me explain something.  You guys are jealous.  Jay, Jay, Jay, hit the button, pal.  You guys are jealous. 
[02:26:00]  It's not jealousy.  You guys are jealous.  It's the freaking truth.  You guys are jealous.  I get lambasted.  I can't just mess up.  You don't show respect to one of the other.  You guys are jealous.  What jokes do I steal?  I don't know what you do on the stage.  We give you guys respect.  That guy, hold on a minute.  I worked with you for an entire weekend at the Rascals Shore.  You saw me do an hour and 15 minutes every night, and now all of a sudden you can't tell  me what jokes I do on stage.  I don't know what you do on stage.  That isn't yours, Jay.  I don't know because I don't live in L.A.  The most of the English guys. 
[02:26:30]  The most of the English guys.  No, my wife.  The women getting ready for bed.  The difference, the dog, the cat, the litter box, all that stuff.  My dog eating her own poop.  Yeah, you're going to be playing guitar.  Nightcrawl.  Oh, that's real good.  Nightcrawl.  Oh, you're cutting edge.  That's 45 minutes right there.  That's 45 minutes from who?  That's from my mind, pal.  A duty act, and you're making fun of guitar act.  A duty act.  A duty act.  That's the whole thing.  I don't even know why.  Why do you want to go there?  That's just baby crap.  I'm taking guitar act back because I don't care who does what on their stage. 
[02:27:00]  If you make the audience laugh, that's your job.  And, Paul, I will, I will.  You never mentioned me even after the damn show.  That was the middle of the day.  Friday, and I pumped you up.  No, you never mentioned me after.  We did six shows together.  We got along great.  Everything was cool.  He pumped you Friday on our show.  Wait, wait, wait.  He did that.  He pumped you Friday.  Friday.  I'm talking about after Rascals.  Was there, is there sick productions?  Well, none of you.  You want him to drag you around like DeNicola?  He had six lesbians up here.  DeNicola, DeNicola, DeNicola.  DeNicola, DeNicola, DeNicola, DeNicola, DeNicola, DeNicola, DeNicola. 
[02:27:30]  Did he do that?  And that's not jealousy?  Did he plug you?  Why is it his job to plug you?  It's not his job.  It's called respect.  I've known him for 10 years.  And you get no freaking respect.  You better credit Rodney Dangerfield for that line.  You better not get respect backing out of a fight with a guy who weighs 200 pounds less than you.  I don't ever recall backing up there, pal.  Okay?  You know, you keep talking all this crap.  We're going to...  7 o'clock is only 20 minutes away.  Cool your jets, pal.  You'll be looking up at the sky soon enough. 
[02:28:00]  It's 20 to 6.  It's 20 to 6.  It's a freaking time, it is.  Oh, we've got an hour of this.  Great.  Okay.  Nah, nah.  He's got a show.  No, I've got a cup in my head from hanging out with you.  He's got a show.  He's got a rough faggot.  Oh, my God.  Stephen Lynch also wants to know...  You want to know why I haven't been on the show.  You wonder why Stephen hasn't been on the show.  I cracked the moon at a guy.  That was...  That's normal.  That's normal.  That was funny.  I don't care.  It's funny.  Yeah.  That's good radio when you're not on the air.  It's good radio.  That's what you do in your private life. 
[02:28:30]  We were in Boston.  That's private life.  Opie, would you ever...  Hold on.  Opie, would you ever, if I walked into your hotel, Paul, come on over, would you ever bare-ass,  open your butt, and then look and say, oh, look at this, this is my hair.  Isn't this funny?  And if someone does that, you can't handle it.  But...  I'm sorry, but it's not exactly...  You're like a homophobe.  Big deal.  I'm not a homophobe, dude.  There's a thing that you guys sing.  I'm tired of him being one way or the other.  You can't be a basher and a gay guy at the same time. 
[02:29:00]  What do you care?  What do you care, man?  What do you care?  What do you care?  I know.  It's none of your business.  What do you care?  As long as he's doing good radio.  Who the F cares?  And that's the bottom line when you're saying that you don't get the respect from us and I'm starstruck  by him, the bottom line, and all I give a flying F about, is if this show sounds good.  If Jay does a week worth of radio, and the only bearing I have on what his performance  has been is emails, feedback, and phone calls, and everyone's raving, that's all I care about.  That's right. 
[02:29:30]  That's it.  It has nothing to do with his personal life.  Well, how come last week when Billy called, it was 50-50 down the middle, but now you're  all of a sudden, it's, it's one way, Anthony.  No, whatever the...  It's only one way now.  What do you mean?  Because you sound like it was last week, because you guys sound like complete idiots, and yeah,  it is one way now.  You know what?  No, we sound like idiots right now.  We said the same thing we said last week, and it was 50-50.  Billy, last week on the phone, it was 50-50, because you were making sense, but today  you guys sounded like complete idiots.  You take the calls.  I defy you to find two.  Put them on the air.  Complete idiots. 
[02:30:00]  Put them on air.  You sound like jealous crybabies.  Complete idiots.  You sound like jealous crybabies.  No, in the comedy community, you sound like jealous crybabies.  You don't steal.  I don't steal.  You don't steal.  I don't steal.  You guys are.  That's a comedy community.  None of you have.  You haven't been.  Okay.  You are?  It's a protocol.  Let's go to my set last night.  I did 20 minutes of a...  I don't know.  Jay, you don't have to...  I don't know.  No, we don't even want to hear.  Jay doesn't have to defend himself.  No, I take pride in my stand-up act.  I take great pride in what I do.  I think it's a craft.  No, you know what?  You crush.  You really do.  And I can't take that away from you.  You can't say that I crush because I'm totally with somebody else's bits. 
[02:30:30]  It's from his...  It's stuff from his life.  I don't see how...  There's stuff about algebra.  There's stuff about the movie projector.  There's stuff about kickball, dodgeball.  I've been listening for a long time here.  Obviously, you guys are jealous because he gets more air-time.  No, stop calling us jealous.  No, it's not that.  Yeah, it is.  Are we going to fight or not respect?  What was the first thing you said?  I've been waiting two hours in the hall.  I never told you guys an exact time.  Oh, yeah?  Well, talk to your people then because your people did.  Whatever.  Oh, whatever.  Don't give us whatever.  Whatever.  Sometimes you've got to wait. 
[02:31:00]  Sometimes you've got to wait.  Okay.  Jay, how long did you wait?  Well, try to wait.  Yeah, I know.  Hey, I'll tell you why.  Because his average is much better than you guys.  You want to be honest?  Yeah, I'll be honest.  You want to be honest?  His average is much better than you guys.  That's why he doesn't wait.  Because when he comes in here, he kills every single freaking moment he's on the air.  All your listeners feel that way, too, huh?  Mostly.  I brought some emails in with me, too.  Let's go to my house.  You want to be honest?  You want to be honest?  Some of the stuff you guys do is really funny, but your average is nowhere near his. 
[02:31:30]  This is nice.  This is nowhere near his.  I'm Ted Williams.  I'm Ted Williams.  You're Ruben Sierra.  You guys, we're talking off the air, and it's a different story than right now.  Now you guys are coming like, oh, you know, Jay, Jay, Jay.  What?  That's not true?  That's not true?  No.  It comes down to what I said.  It comes down to on the air.  Well, aren't you lucky?  What sounds good on the air?  I'm not here.  Aren't you lucky?  You're getting a break.  Dude, I...  There's a problem.  Dear God, this is going out on the air. 
[02:32:00]  Four million listeners, dear God, please let this fat guy in me hook up alone, either  after the show or before or after any of my shows.  Jay, Jay, Jay.  Jay, Jay, Jay.  And you know what?  I won't even pray for a victory.  What happens, happens.  We'll throw, we'll throw.  If I get knocked out, congratulations.  I'll kiss your feet.  But I don't think it's going to go that way, you fat ass.  Oh, Jay, you're so brilliant.  Fat jokes.  You got fat guy on your t-shirt.  I'm saying that's how brilliant you are.  You go for the obvious.  Be original. 
[02:32:30]  Try being original for once in your goddamn life.  Okay.  I just said the crackhead teddy bear.  I said you guys got to sell the teddy bears.  That was about 10 minutes.  And I did that off the air.  I didn't even work a little off the air.  This is going nowhere.  This is going nowhere.  And you know what, all it amounts to is that whatever I said, which is obviously a lot of comedic, I take it back.  Thank you.  That was not fair because you crush.  And my friends, my comic friends know, and I always defend people.  They go, oh, Carrot Top this.  I go, look, I don't care what Carrot Top brings on stage. 
[02:33:00]  He does his job.  I'd much rather see a guy like Paul Bond go up with a guitar and crush than like a Janine Garofalo.  Yeah, I'll say the names.  Janine Garofalo or like Andy Kindler go up who are too hit for the room like a Margaret Cho and lose the room.  I agree with that.  You absolutely destroyed.  And you do write your stuff.  And I said that in the heat of passion.  And I actually had no beef with you when I popped you up Friday.  But this guy coming off his chair to come over here.  And I don't think he was coming over to rub my freaking shoulders.  That's why I got up and went after him.  You got out.  You took your headset off.  You weren't coming over here. 
[02:33:30]  Sorry.  Didn't mean that one.  Sorry, guys.  You're talking crap.  Get it down the hall.  You're talking crap.  And if you think I'm backpedaling, when you're privately with Kevin and what's your name again?  Steve.  I'm sorry, Steve.  It's heat of passion.  And Anthony's brother.  These guys, these are some big boys.  You asked them how hard I was trying to get to you.  I know how hard I wanted to punch you right in your face.  You have it on video, so.  And you got it on video.  Okay.  It took three of these guys to hold me back.  I wasn't fair.  I didn't go anywhere.  But that's not what this is all about. 
[02:34:00]  It wasn't supposed to be.  When he got off his seat to come in to me, that's it, man.  That's the rule.  Oh, that's it.  I'm not going to sit here.  I'm not going to sit here.  That doesn't change anything about what you are.  You're a phony, two-faced little prick.  That's absolutely not true, so it doesn't offend me.  Why don't you?  It's absolutely not true, so it doesn't bother me.  You're a phony, you two-faced.  You tell these guys face-to-face, you're the only show I'll ever do.  Blah, blah, blah.  You never.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  He's never said that.  Did I do Howard?  He's done Howard.  He's never said that. 
[02:34:30]  No, I did not.  No.  No, I did not.  You wanted, whatever.  Casey called Matt Frost.  Where's Frosty?  Casey called Matt Frost.  Dude, I don't even care.  I care.  I care.  You know what?  I care.  I know.  Whenever we say it, it doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  What we say, does it matter?  No matter what you say, they're going to back you in it.  My buddy wants to say it.  I don't care.  It doesn't mean that much to me anymore.  You know, you made me realize it doesn't mean that much to me anymore.  I'm talking to you two.  The walls right here.  I'm not even in this conversation right now. 
[02:35:00]  Okay.  That is their show.  It was.  Paul's leaving.  There's one less guy to hold you back if we want to go at it again.  Oh, man.  Let's send one of these guys.  Why do you think this is funny?  Because you know I'm going to kick your ass.  That's what's funny to me.  That's what's funny to me.  Yeah, you should do that on stage.  That's what's funny to me.  I think that's original.  Why don't you come on stage?  Paul, come on.  I'll be glad to.  Billy.  You guys aren't here, remember?  Wait, you talk about originality.  Every time we've had you at a road show, what have you done?  What have you asked me to do? 
[02:35:30]  Chris Farley.  Yeah.  What have you asked me to do?  I don't know what else you do.  Oh, okay.  Well, I'm being honest.  I couldn't name another bit you do.  I haven't seen you live.  I know you do.  Chris Farley.  You talk about originality.  That's not too original.  It's called an impression.  Is there another one?  No one who does an impression now is a thief?  I guess so.  Okay, so you're going to have Kevin Paulick in it.  So you're going to be a thief when he does impressions?  You know what?  Let me define that for you.  If you do the impression of the person and actually do their jokes, you're a thief, a  la Elon Gold.  Right.  Right.  If you do an impression of a comic and make up your own jokes, that's fine. 
[02:36:00]  Okay.  Right.  Walken doesn't have any jokes, so I got off easy.  Andrew McCarthy doesn't have any jokes, so I got off easy.  De Niro doesn't have any jokes.  Pesci doesn't have any jokes.  By the way, so again, it's coming to me now, or us.  You notice it?  It's like, it's absolutely amazing.  Mary, what's up?  I should say we cut our losses.  Mary.  Yes.  Hi, what's up?  Well, I just have a little bit of input here.  I think that, Jay, you don't need to defend yourself at all.  I think that these two guys are completely out of their league.  I think that, I mean, let's get with the program here. 
[02:36:30]  Jay, you guys, and L.P., Anthony, you're real celebrities here.  Don't waste your time with...  See, that's it.  That's where you're going.  You're real celebrities here.  See, that's the thing.  I mean, everyone's starstruck.  Get off of it and realize what a thief is.  I think I would definitely agree with you.  If somebody came to your job and stole your paperwork, would you be a little pissed?  Yeah.  I think you'd be a little pissed and a little hot.  You said what?  You never legitimized what's stolen.  I'm here.  I don't know what you do in your act that's yours or not.  I don't know.  And has Jay stolen anything from you, Paul? 
[02:37:00]  For me, no.  Who am I storing?  No, but I'm getting crap from other comics because, you know, I'm on a show that supports  Jay more and I'm not saying anything.  Starfish, stick up for yourself with the other comics and tell them to go F themselves.  Why do you worry about it?  Apparently, now, that's the direction I've got to go because I've got no support here.  If I do an hour and 15 minutes of material that's original and Starfish slips its way in,  I don't think that's being a thief. 
[02:37:30]  And I would bet money Otto and George got it from someone else, too.  It's not that original.  It's a line.  You throw lines around when you drink it with your friends at a bar.  My whole life, and I don't think they all got it from Otto and George.  And I pump Otto and George up more than anybody.  I've never heard you mention him on the show.  I've heard him mention.  I've heard him mention Otto.  You've never heard him mention Otto.  I absolutely did.  He mentioned it.  I got him in a show action.  And I got him seven grand.  I got him in my freaking TV show.  Did it air?  No.  Oh, that's my fault.  The Fox canceled the show. 
[02:38:00]  I'm a bad guy.  They canceled the show because I stole all my lives.  Oh, so the show got canceled.  It had nothing to do with you.  I stole my lives from Ian Zari.  Oh, wait.  You hear this?  The show got canceled.  It had nothing to do with Jay.  Cut the losses.  Cut the losses.  There's nothing to be gained anymore from this situation.  Everything's lost.  Everything's foul for us.  No, you're wrong, Paul.  Oh, my God.  Because it's still air-sick productions.  You guys are still on the air.  Yeah, it's like all the fans want to hear us now, Jay. 
[02:38:30]  You heard what...  Paul, believe it or not, I don't have a problem with you right now at this moment.  My only...  Well, when you say I steal, my problem is you haven't been able to identify.  I'll go through my entire act, but it's not that long of a show because I got overthrown.  Well, I wish a comic with a backbone would call up.  You're not even admitting it now.  Why are you going to admit it if you go through your set list?  What if it's not going to happen?  Paul, no one's going to call up.  What comic wrote my massage bit?  What comic wrote my Ricky Lake stuff?  What comic wrote all that?  The English guy.  The waving line at the airport.  Don't even screen the calls.  Let the calls come through live and see what comes through. 
[02:39:00]  My only problem now is you taking your headset off and rushing at me.  Why is that a problem for you now?  Because you can't...  Why is that a problem for you now?  Because you can't...  Billy, Billy.  You came at me.  Billy, it's done.  And you came back to me.  It's done.  We're done.  That's the only problem.  He goes on.  That's the end of the story.  We're stable walking with a bull hanging out going, rascals, rascals, rascals, and everything's  well, and everything's great.  Say it again for me.  You know what?  Kiss my ass, guys.  Well, now you're going to leave without fighting me.  I told you, Brooklyn Dine, you want me to write it down for your pussy?  I'll be there.  Okay.  And now we got witnesses, so if I don't go there, you know I'm a puss. 
[02:39:30]  I think he's plugging a diamond.  Now, that's funny.  I'm sorry.  That's pretty good.  That's a good line.  Kevin, you guys get on mic.  Come here.  I want you guys on mic.  These guys, we got them on video, right?  Yeah.  Kevin, how much do you weigh?  Kevin, what do you weigh?  About 325.  Look, what do you bench?  If the people aren't in there, 320, he weighs 320.  Now it's about who's stronger.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:40:00]  Now it's about who's stronger.  It's about who has a bigger penis now.  No, no, no.  It's not about who's stronger.  It's ridiculous.  No, no, no.  Paul, please.  If those people weren't in here, you two would have been throwing at each other.  Yeah.  And he's saying, you know, because he said I was backpedaling, blah, blah, blah.  No, no.  And look at the sides of these guys.  I want you guys to get on mic and say, I was practically throwing these two.  These guys are giants.  It was obvious that, yeah, please, you both would have been on each other.  Please.  That would be entertaining.  Oh, and your brother. 
[02:40:30]  I forgot.  And somebody was over there holding him back.  You can't.  I'm sorry this happened.  This is not what I wanted for.  You can't have fisticuffs in the studio.  Like I said before.  No, no.  Believe me.  The guy took his headset off and came at me.  I would love.  What are you supposed to do?  Let a guy smack you?  I love this.  What planet are you for, Anthony?  No, I would love to see a good fist fight, but more than the next guy.  I can't afford a lawsuit.  I'd like to be in one more than the next guy.  Lawsuit.  Jay, you've got to know about that, right?  Come on.  He came at me.  The man got off his chair and came at me.  That's assault.  I'm off the hook.  Okay. 
[02:41:00]  You pound.  No, I'm not talking for you.  The guy weighs 350 pounds and came at me.  Jay, you punch him in the face.  He falls down and dies.  All of a sudden, his family is suing who?  Who?  Me, because I've got more money than you.  You, right.  No.  No, no, everybody, the station, Opie and Anthony, my brother, everybody.  My brother.  Jay, please, I want to leave some money for my ex-wife.  Please, please don't take it all.  For the love of God.  I would like to state on the air to four million people listening in the cars, 
[02:41:30]  I think Paul Bond is hilarious.  And the fat guy, I think, needs a beating.  But Paul Bond, I don't think, should take any.  I have no problem with Paul Bond in this entire situation.  My problem, though, is when you guys call me like a thief and like a fake,  that's not a problem because I know me and I know in my heart of hearts it's just not true.  So that doesn't bother me.  When I mix in starfish with an hour and a half of A-plus material and, in your words,  crush and get a standing ovation or an encore or whatever, 
[02:42:00]  that doesn't bother me at all because it's just not true.  What bothers me is that guy coming off the stool at me.  And Paul Bond, to this day, I will go on record as saying, absolutely destroyed.  He's got no business opening for anybody.  And I think he was just doing Camacho and Mark Magnuson, the rascals of favor,  keeping the show together because I think he was supposed to headline that weekend.  And it was hard following a guy who's so goddamn funny.  Well, thanks, because I'm sure I'm not going to be on this show anymore.  I think he will be on the show some more.  Well, I don't think that...  Jay, it's gotten very bad. 
[02:42:30]  It's gotten very bad.  This has gotten so bad that I have no...  I have no...  You have not been formally dubbed enemy of the show.  All right.  I'm just...  It's me and him getting a fight and you're with him.  Don't hold me...  Don't hold me back.  Hold him back.  Because I don't want to get punched in the mouth when someone's grabbed my arms.  I just...  I didn't want it to go this way.  But...  Yeah, we didn't know there was going to be a fish fight.  The guy came off the stool and washed me.  Hey, look.  I understand.  I saw the whole thing.  Believe me.  And I know if both of you weren't being held back... 
[02:43:00]  I was down.  I was down for it.  It would have been...  Somebody would have gotten very badly...  Hurt very badly.  It wouldn't have been me, baby.  I don't need that.  Thank you.  I didn't want to...  I didn't want to burn this...  I didn't want to burn the bridge here.  Why don't you come to Rascals tonight and do some time?  Let's make up at Rascals.  Jesus Christ.  I'm serious.  Is this live?  Yeah.  Here we go.  Okay, now.  Come on.  Like everybody.  Kumbaya, my lord. 
[02:43:30]  Kumbaya.  Hold on.  Just coming to Rascals.  Kumbaya, my lord.  That guy's a bit knocked out.  Kumbaya.  Kumbaya.  Kumbaya.  Kumbaya.  It is far right now.  Kumbaya.  Does everybody feel better now?  Hey, can I do this, Joe?  Paul, you want to come to Rascals?  I have a dream of a dream. 
[02:44:00]  I have somebody else to answer to, too.  I feel it.  Well, I'm out here in front of the Brooklyn Diner.  Where's the thing?  Oh, my God.  No, no, no.  Please take the little crap on the internet and meet me.  I'm down here.  Where is the bag?  Stop eating already.  Yeah, that's funny, too.  You know, who's talking about being a tough guy and being down here?  Oh, I'm down here.  Where are you, faggot?  I'll be on my way down.  Why don't you guys read some of the instant feedbacks I was reading before I came on the air  calling Jay a homo and a two-faced son of a bitch?  You haven't read any of those on the air, have you? 
[02:44:30]  I'm leaving.  You have the instant feedback, you guys.  Come on.  We'll look at him, then.  Look at him.  Come on, Jay.  I'm waiting for you, buddy.  I'm in here.  I'm in here, Jay.  I will be down.  I just invited your partner to come and do time.  How do you feel about that?  I'm waiting for you, buddy.  I'll give a...  What?  Paul's going to come and do time with you?  Yeah, I got to hold him.  Over my dead body.  In about five minutes, we'll have that...  Hey, Billy, if I don't do time tonight, I'm done. 
[02:45:00]  Paul, you're not doing time tonight.  Uh-oh.  Paul, you have to say it any clearer?  Oh, boy.  Dude, I can't not do time.  You can't not do time.  Billy...  You want to become a bitch like Dean Nicole or what?  No, Billy, but you know how...  Billy, this has gotten too ugly.  This has gone too far.  Yeah, thanks for a nice birthday, President Paul.  Billy...  You son of a bitch.  Today's your birthday? 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, it's his birthday.  Oh, good.  Then I feel better punching your nose.  Yeah, what's doing?  Yeah, Jay.  That's nice.  You're doing a lot of talk with somebody who's still up there, pal.  You think I'm going to leave without plugging the show?  What are you doing for you?  How about Jay tonight, Rascals, tomorrow night?  Come and see...  Hey, we got something.  Tonight with Paul Bond, your former partner, your fat-ass Sui Liesma, tonight.  Yeah, we won't.  We won't.  Billy, why are you telling Paul what to do?  Yeah.  That is a little weird, too.  Billy, I'm not...  I'm trying to save whatever we got left, Billy. 
[02:46:00]  Billy, I'm not...  Wait, Paul, when did we start having a problem, Paul?  Wait, I don't know.  Don't forget that.  When did me and you start having a problem?  We don't have a problem, Billy.  Hey, shut the hell up.  You're nothing.  Shut up.  Billy, I'm going to do something in a minute.  Billy, we don't have a problem.  You can't keep talking, you faggot.  You're telling all the listeners you're going to come and kick my ass.  Well, here I am.  I got to leave.  Take a leak and get in an elevator.  Jesus, give a guy for me. 
[02:46:30]  Any more excuses?  Any more excuses, pussy?  Billy, listen.  In all fairness to Jay, there's no way he's going to be able to get out of this studio.  Of course.  There's one, two, three...  Hey, guys, of course it's all fairness to Jay.  Billy, there's six people between Jay and the door.  You tell me how you're getting through the door.  You know what I'm starting to think?  I'm thinking that Jay called Paul at some point.  They got together and they're trying to scam something on us. 
[02:47:00]  What?  What?  You two are making like you're in cahoots right now.  Billy, Billy, if I don't go...  I'll know when you punch my guy in the face.  No, Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Wait, wait, wait.  What?  All right.  Hold on.  Jay, Jay, Jay.  Don't go anywhere.  Jay, Jay.  He's taking a leak.  Jay's taking a leak.  Let him go.  Anthony.  Yeah.  I don't know what to do.  I'm starting to think.  Oh, I swear.  I got this inkling.  You know how I am. 
[02:47:30]  I'm getting an inkling that something is predetermined between these guys.  We are done if I don't do time tonight.  So why does that make me look like the bad guy?  Because your partner doesn't know you to do it.  So maybe I got to think about what my partner's anger is right now and do what's right for  the show instead of what my partner's feeling.  This could be a nice wrestling story.  So you're going to bail on me now for a five minutes.  I'm not bailing on you, Billy.  I'm saying what we got left.  Yeah.  How is this thing?  I don't put any side. 
[02:48:00]  I'm not on their side.  Did they invite me to do the damn show?  Yeah.  Were you on the show already, Paul?  Or is this like throwing...  Billy, the prop.  How am I supposed to do here?  Hello?  I got to take a break.  What?  Jay invited me to do the show.  Just for the record, I'm still out here and still no Jay faggot.  He's in the bathroom.  He's in the bathroom.  Yeah, of course he is.  Probably whacking him off looking at the blue boys.  Easy. 
[02:48:30]  All right, we got to take a break.  Hey, was that a joke?  That was funny.  Yeah, I'll give you that.  Oh, okay, good, yeah.  Maybe I'll come in as often as see Nicola now.  All right.  Billy, what do you want?  Both of them down there now?  We'll take one right now, Paul.  I would take one right now.  Billy, what do we got if I don't go on stage tonight at Rascals?  What do we got?  Give me all the plugs.  Hold on a second.  He's a fan.  Hold on.  Yeah.  Wait, where am I, dude?  That's Brooklyn Diane.  Here's some guy who's a fan.  Hold on.  Jay, you guys both rock. 
[02:49:00]  Oh.  Oh, okay.  Now what?  He's a good guy.  We both rock.  Come on.  Be nice to him.  All right.  Well, hey, stay down there.  You might catch the show.  I don't think he's a sympathy, but yeah, he's a strong guy.  All right.  Now, wait a minute.  I got to know something.  I got to know something.  All right.  Is he going?  He's going down.  All right.  Take a break.  Take a break.  I ain't buying this.  I'm not buying this anymore, either. 
[02:49:30]  I'm not buying it.  If Billy doesn't want me to go on stage.  Dude, he's not like your gay lover.  You have a mind of your own.  I don't buy it.  I think that...  But wait, wait, wait, wait.  I'm just saying it...  What did I gain from this, Anthony?  What did I gain?  I'm just saying, what if you didn't do the slot tonight?  Is that very bad?  If I can't...  You're out of the way.  No.  You can't curse, man.  No one's hearing what you're saying.  Bond even pushed out on the show.  Well, they all ran downstairs, Anthony.  Yeah, I think so.  I have a feeling there might be some little storyline here that we don't know about. 
[02:50:00]  I don't know.  But take a break.  I'd love to see what happens.  All right.  We'll be back.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony Rick Spass.  The four morons of the apocalypse.  1027 WNEW.  Where is Anthony?  It's Opie and Anthony.  We're back on the radio.  We had to cut back into spots.  1027 WNEW.  So, someone get...  Did Anthony go downstairs?  All right.  Well, we got...  Hey, Rick.  Yeah.  What's going on? 
[02:50:30]  Well, there's a crowd gathering.  Yeah.  You'd think it's Vegas or something, the way people are lining up around here.  All right.  Hold on.  Yeah, go ahead.  Anthony's downstairs, I guess.  Oh, good.  Tell him we can't get a line inside the building.  He's got to come outside.  Someone tell Anthony to go outside.  Just give him...  Just give him your phone.  Jay.  Here comes Anthony.  Here comes Anthony.  Tommy?  Jay, what's up?  Can you hear me?  Yeah, I got you.  All right.  I'm going on now.  All right.  Anthony, what's going on? 
[02:51:00]  Well, I'm down here in the courtyard.  I'm not believing this, but Jay's coming out now.  I'm still...  Until someone...  Where is he?  I can't...  Dude, they're going to go.  They're going to go.  At this point, I think we've been having it.  Wait a minute.  All right.  They're throwing.  They're not.  There they go.  Yeah.  They're fighting.  That guy is on, Jay.  Holy cow.  Don't hold him back.  Someone's going to get hurt.  Just holding him.  They just pulled him apart.  They went a little bit. 
[02:51:30]  I don't know if anybody got close.  And you can't let them put him on.  I'm a person.  Yeah.  Oh.  Dude.  Now that they just got separated again.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They just got separated.  All right.  But I didn't see any real punches being thrown.  Don't hold anybody if they get hurt.  All right.  They just went on fat guy.  How many people are down? 
[02:52:00]  Dude, I'm not buying this.  No, I'm not either at this point.  I'm not buying this.  I'm not believing this.  I don't believe this.  Why won't you believe it?  We think we're on each other and nothing.  That I would purposely come in here and make us look like a-holes.  Give me a rascal.  Hello.  I don't know.  I'm not believing it.  Opie.  Yeah. 
[02:52:30]  This guy fights like a girl.  I don't know.  Because people still pull them apart.  Yeah.  Right?  People still pull them apart.  All right.  This is better than-  So if they kick each other's ass, then it's real.  This is better than the WWF, Anthony.  If they kick each other's ass, it's real, Anthony.  Huh?  If they kick each other's ass, it's real.  Yeah.  If all of a sudden somebody laid into a-  Well, tell him to stop.  I'm not afraid that Billy can't handle himself. 
[02:53:00]  Tell him to stop pulling him by.  I'm still not believing it.  No, Billy can't wait.  He was part of the whole back.  I think they're protecting you, pal.  He's serious.  I don't know.  It might be authentic.  I've been wrong.  Believe me.  Nah, Paul, I don't believe Paul anymore.  That guy's so out of breath.  Yeah.  Jay would kill him right now.  I don't know.  He's getting pretty.  You don't want to wait for him.  Yeah.  I just tried to tag him.  Yeah.  Hey, what's going on down there? 
[02:53:30]  They're holding Jay back.  You know why they're not letting me go.  That guy's standing there.  They're about, I don't know, 10 yards apart.  But there's people holding each of them back.  They won't let him go.  They won't let him fight.  I can see you on the field, man.  How many people are down there?  Traffic is stopped on 57.  The courtyard is packed.  And, uh...  Give him a two-minute fight.  No, we can't sanction anything. 
[02:54:00]  We cannot sanction anything.  If they go at it, they go at it.  Unfortunately, that's the only way I would believe it.  Wait a minute.  Yeah, they're screaming at each other.  Here comes Judge Milfrey.  Cruising each other.  This is all outside the Brooklyn diner.  Yeah, there's a huge crowd that's developing.  Surprisingly, no cops yet.  I'm waiting for it.  It's all the crowd to wrap. 
[02:54:30]  They keep on plugging.  I'll see you tonight.  I'll see you tonight.  Yeah.  I'm going inside.  All right.  I don't...  I'll see you tonight.  Here comes Judge Milfrey.  Here comes Judge Milfrey.  And what's going on?  I don't know, Judge.  Coming back up.  I'm talking.  They locked Jay in the...  They just locked Jay in the revolving door.  Let the record reflect.  I came out here and I smacked you around.  And we got separated. 
[02:55:00]  I'm a pussy.  You want to weigh me by 200 pounds?  How can I be a pussy?  You want to weigh me by two men?  I didn't get hit in the head.  I'm pretty.  I was him.  I landed six shots on you, pal.  These people saw it.  I came out of the studio to come and fight you.  I didn't back down from you.  Everyone knows.  I did not back down from you.  You're a punk.  You're a 20.  All right, Ant. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  That guy is just like...  Is he one of you?  Uh, yeah.  Hello?  Yeah.  Yo, from there, everyone's heard you already.  Jeez, we're in the studio.  We're in the lobby now.  Where?  Where's my head?  Yeah.  Everyone's going back upstairs.  All right.  That guy's still waiting out here.  All right, Ant.  Come on back up.  Okay.  All right.  The phones are breaking up in the lobby,  so we're going to take a break. 
[02:56:00]  Okay, man.  I'll see you in a little bit, Ant.  All right.  Bye.  Hey, Anthony, MindSpring Internet Services.  Are you kidding me?  No, I'm not.  We'll get screwed.  It's a joke, right?  I know.  It's no longer a radio show,  but we've got to take care of the sponsors.  MindSpring Internet Services, Anthony.  Did you curse?  No.  Oh.  The Jay Moore fat guy fight brought to you by MindSpring.  I got separated, but I'd like to say for the record,  on the judge's cards, I'm way up.  Because I landed six clean shots,  but he's so freaking fat, he can feel them. 
[02:56:30]  I've got to see the video.  I've got to get the swivel.  I've got to see the cursing.  It's crazy.  He got hit in the air.  I know.  Jeff Norris has made it into the air.  Jeff Norris got clocked in a year.  He got clocked.  I can see you're here, man.  Archie got swollen.  Archie got clocked.  I'll let you get to the live reads.  What did I say on my way to the elevator?  You want to go down alone?  Don't follow me down, because it's going to get separated.  Right.  And I landed, I threw the first punch, and I missed a pussy.  I glanced one off his face, and then he grabbed me, 
[02:57:00]  and then we started throwing, and you guys sent like 15 freaking people down there.  I didn't send no one.  No, we didn't send anybody.  I sent down shit.  No, we didn't send anybody.  All right.  They followed you.  Where the hell was my Bucs cat?  Screw the Bucs.  They suck anyway.  Hey.  Don't get him.  He's all mad.  Look at his head.  Look at his head.  I thought it was something.  The fat guy's down there holding court.  Everyone's down there cheering for me.  Archie Bunker's hat in the bank.  He wears hat.  What's Archie Bunker saying? 
[02:57:30]  Oh, jeez.  I hate to jam here.  I didn't do that long.  What the hell is going on, fat guy Paul Arley?  Is that the fat guy's in the EVE anyway?  Oh, my God.  Wait.  All right, listen.  I'm taking note.  I didn't say that.  All right, hold on.  Billy's back on the phone, but we've got to talk about MindSpring, Anthony.  Yes, MindSpring Internet Service.  Yes.  Haven't they teamed with Earthlink?  They've joined forces with Earthlink to bring you the best Internet access in the world.  Right.  Here's the deal.  It's very simple.  Call 1-888-M-Spring today, and MindSpring will give you the first three months of service 
[02:58:00]  for the price of one.  That's three months of service for the price of one.  Right.  If you call MindSpring Internet Services at 1-888-M-Spring.  Okay?  Right.  Call 1-888-M-Spring now and ask for the three months of service for the price of one.  That's 1-888-M-Spring.  You'd be happier using MindSpring.  We'll be back.  Stay there.  Anthony.  Rockaway betting.  Hey.  Hey, Jay.  Jay back in the studio from his melee.  You've got to be in on the Rockaway betting library, right? 
[02:58:30]  Right, Jay?  You know, my back and my vertebrae are so well aligned that I was able to withstand an overhand  right from a 350-pound man that I slipped and hit Jeff Norris in his left.  Oh, he hit you?  Look at his ear.  I thought Fat Guy hit you.  I want you to look at his ear.  Oh, your ear is destroyed, man.  I need a bet.  He needs a Rockaway betting.  He can take a shot.  He's like a judo champ.  He can take the shot.  I ducked it.  Look how red his ear is.  I thought Billy hit him.  Oh, hey.  He made it.  No, the Fat Guy hit him.  He went to hit me and I slipped it. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, okay.  All right, so the Fat Guy did hit you.  Yeah, I got more Collie Slower and Pamp Mark.  Billy's with the cops downstairs.  Billy?  Hold on.  We'll get to Rockaway betting in a second.  Fat Guy.  Yo.  Hey, what's up?  I got a question for you guys.  Yeah.  If Jay isn't a big pussy and scared to meet me, why did his manager call the police,  the little scared faggot?  Because my manager doesn't want me to get sued because he's a funny...  Why did your manager call the police if you're not a little faggot and he's looking  out for your well-being?  Because that's his job.  You look out for a pussy?  Oh, Jay, you should be very proud. 
[02:59:30]  You should be very proud that your manager had to call the police because you can't  defend yourself.  I think you should be very proud.  Yeah, I think it just got to show the people who know you best really do know you best,  Jay.  I think the people on the street saw me land six shots to your fat ass.  You know what, Jay?  Jay, you can talk all you want.  Let's talk.  We got a new video.  I pummeled you.  You didn't torture me.  Wait till you see the videotape, you little puss.  How come your manager had to call the police?  Because he's protecting my...  How come your manager had to call the police?  What, are you going to get hurt?  What did your manager call the police?  What are you protecting you from?  Me?  If I had a manager, I'd hope he would call the police, so... 
[03:00:00]  I didn't call the police.  I went down there to fight you.  And what did I say when I left the studio?  Nobody follow me.  Let's go down and fight.  Huh?  I was kicking people out of the elevator because I don't want anybody to break it up.  Jay, how come you didn't come down by yourself?  I...  Hey, no, no.  I...  Hey, back me up.  Yeah, Billy, Jay did.  He tried to sneak out and everyone ran and followed him.  I see how quickly they caught up to him, huh?  It's called an elevator.  And I waited...  Really?  Oh, thanks for cleaning up.  And I waited...  You know what?  Why don't you come down by yourself? 
[03:00:30]  You have to...  We'll meet some...  Put Jay on the phone privately.  Let's talk off the air.  You're not going to let me come down by myself.  We've got to do it at all the time.  The pussy manager's protecting you, right?  Yeah, that's his job, Billy.  I had nothing to do with it.  Oh, okay.  That's because you're not talented enough to have a manager.  He knows you're going to get your ass kicked.  Look, Billy, this is his pussy manager.  I know extras who got more...  Oh, Billy.  Okay.  Hey, Billy.  How you doing, man?  I'm fine.  Will you have work for your client?  Yeah, I...  This is his pussy manager.  Oh, hi, pussy manager.  How are you?  How you doing, buddy? 
[03:01:00]  It's also known as the big Jew.  What?  That's the big Jew, Barakash.  Are you okay, man?  Are you...  You need some tea?  Some tea?  Some tea.  How about a bagel and a knish?  All right, man.  You've got to calm down, you know.  Okay.  Give me a call at the time.  How can you call at the time?  What are you afraid of?  I think he's afraid for you because he's seen me fight before.  I'm not his client.  What the hell does he care?  I've never seen Jay fight a bag of onions before. 
[03:01:30]  Oh!  Come on.  Get off the phone.  Get this kike off the phone.  Oh, my God.  Billy, man.  Wow.  You've got to watch with the racist stuff.  You need a lot of people, man.  That's line three of one of the songs.  How'd he hang out?  All right.  He hung out.  For the record.  For the record.  And I'm going to leave and you guys can close the show with all your reads.  And I want the listeners to listen to these commercials because they're great sponsors.  I'll be a rascal tonight at 8.30. 
[03:02:00]  If Billy wants to come down and fight me, I will be there.  Yes.  All right?  And I don't want anybody in the audience chanting his name while I'm on stage because  it's just going to take away from the comedy.  And where's Paul?  Paul left.  Paul left, too?  But I want it known for the record.  I begged you guys to let me go to the elevator alone.  You would not let me.  I said I was taking up this.  And then I ran to the elevator.  Yeah.  But then you had to wait for the elevator and everyone caught up to you.  And then I'm waiting for the elevator.  Norris, the Kung Fu expert, gets in like, hey, you don't have to do this.  You got your career. 
[03:02:30]  I'm like, Jeff, I'm not planning on losing.  I wouldn't go out there if I thought the guy was going to beat me up.  I didn't question a way to know whoosh.  I can't.  Oh, man.  Anyway.  Man.  That was.  Anthony comes down and he goes, I'll know it's real if you actually punch him.  Well, you know, so.  Six times.  Look.  Jeff Norris has cauliflower ears because I ducked his overhand right.  I know.  I didn't sing.  That fat bastard had one shot in him and I ducked it.  I'll be honest.  It was getting so weird in here that we weren't. 
[03:03:00]  It was just getting so surreal and a little weird.  The guy came at me.  We saw.  I saw everything.  Trust me.  But then it just started getting so over the top weird that we're like, wait, maybe they're in cahoots or something.  Yeah.  At the time where you invite Paul to open the show, you can almost admit it.  It might sound like.  I know.  Divide and conquer.  I heard you on the radio project.  Divide and conquer.  Divide and conquer.  Yes.  That was a brilliant move, by the way.  Yeah.  Now they're fighting.  Brilliant.  Because now he wanted to do the show very badly.  Now we hook up alone and just the two of them and me.  Now Paul's not going to punch me in the back of the head. 
[03:03:30]  Paul will be like, well, he did all from the stage time.  That was a brilliant move, though, man.  Well, he knows.  And then Billy's telling Paul he can't do time.  Like he's his lover or something.  Yeah, he's calling me gay.  And he's like, sweetheart, you can't go on.  Sweetheart, you got your piano lesson.  We should do something where we can, you know, maybe even in a ring or something.  Oh, that would be great.  No gloves.  No gloves.  No gloves.  No gloves.  No tag team.  A real fight club.  Real small gloves. 
[03:04:00]  No gloves.  Because I, look at these knuckles.  I know I can, I'll open them up.  I got real, look at these knuckles.  That'll open them right up.  Cut right through his skin.  Look at those, man.  You got the same knuckles as I did.  Razor blades.  The razor blades.  Yeah, just leather gloves.  All right, Jay, Jay, before we let you go to rascals, one show tonight, you should do  like eight shows tonight.  I can't.  You should do an all-nighter tonight because they're going to be at the door.  I know I didn't waste any energy on the fat bastard.  I'm going to crap down a chukadonking. 
[03:04:30]  All right, Rockaway betting.  What can you tell the fine folks about the Rockaway betting, Jay Moore?  I know for a fact that I just threw six unimpeded body blows to a fat bastard and my back feels  fine because I slept for nine hours last night on my queen-sized Rockaway bed and they  had over, over 50% off everybody.  Like, what is it, 65 now?  Something like, yeah.  It's ridiculous, Rockaway betting.  And they had many, many, many stores.  And I.  130 in the New York area.  That's more stores. 
[03:05:00]  In Jersey.  That's more, that's, okay, that's 124 more stores than I threw punches on the fat  card.  I don't buy the bed for my ear.  Actually, no, 123 because my first, my overhand, my lead right.  Oh, my freaking lead right list.  That's what pisses me off.  How did a fat guy like that move his head that fast?  God damn.  It went right up to the side of his left cheek.  Hey, and it took two and a half hours, but we're finally getting comedy out of Jay.  Hey, but you didn't say that.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, did you hear that, Billy? 
[03:05:30]  And everybody made fun of me.  And he stole that from somebody.  Hey, guys, I love you.  And, oh, this is the Map of Hawaii shirt.  Yes.  Yes.  Which I stole.  Yes, Hawaii.  Yeah, you stole that.  You stole that?  You stole the shirt?  All right, listen, let's wrap up the ride.  Gentlemen, thanks a lot.  I'm leaving.  I got to go, I got to cool down.  I'm like nuts now.  All right, man.  What are you doing tomorrow?  We'll have somebody else come in here that you want to get out.  Yeah, but you got to keep the goons out.  No.  You got to keep the bodyguards out.  No one else will get into the studio tomorrow. 
[03:06:00]  We got to get the lesbian.  I'll fight them.  That's what we need.  I'll fight them.  Chicks, naked girls.  We need the lesbian kiddie pool for tomorrow.  I'll fight the lesbians.  Someone said we need a naked girl in glass with a hammer next to it in case of emergency.  Just like we'll break the glass and naked chick will be on.  All the hostilities cease.  I got a good idea.  Okay.  All right.  Me and him fight.  No bodyguards.  The winner gets the whore.  Little incentive.  You see the whore going, come on, chick.  Jake, please. 
[03:06:30]  Why?  It's a joke.  Why?  Oh, oh.  If I said it the other way, everything would be fine?  Jeff Norris wants in now, too.  Jeff Norris has got a tattoo of karate on his arm.  I know.  That's bad, man.  He gets a yell at him.  I'm like, Jeff, let me go.  I'm not going out there to lose, Jeff.  He's concerned.  He's concerned for me.  Look at the size of this guy.  Why don't you go outside and bench TJ on Friday's?  More comedy tonight.  Thanks for letting me plug Rascals tonight and tomorrow night.  You stole that line. 
[03:07:00]  Who's that from?  I'm a cold fun spot.  And I want Jeff to come down and open, because Dina Kolo is cold opening, and it's a tough  gig.  So I'm going to maybe, I'll talk to Magnus and I'll throw you up.  It's only going to be like five minutes, though.  It's five minutes ago.  Just to watch you bunker and get off the stage.  And don't forget, Stone Temple Pilots will be there tonight at Rascals and tomorrow night  at Irving Plaza.  Corbett and Testa Verde tomorrow night also.  That's a good one.  Are you going to be beating them up?  No.  No.  Corbett would melt me. 
[03:07:30]  All right, listen.  Thanks, guys.  I love you.  All right, wait.  We want to say goodbye to you.  It's Rockaway Bedding.  1-800-TRY-A-BED.  Rockaway Bedding is the official provider of mattresses for Anthony and our buddy Jay Moore.  1-800-TRY-A-BED for Rockaway Bedding.  1-800-TRY-A-BED.  1-800-TRY-A-BED.  1-800-TRY-A-BED.  I'm all for violence sometimes.  1-800-TRY-A-BED.  Anthony.  Hey, you guys are a bunch of pusses.  God, I want to punch you in the face.  That'll leave a bruise.  1-027-WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:08:00]  Holy mother of God.  Opie, this just in.  Nikki from We Deliver Keggers called, and she's jealous of all the attention Smelly Karen was getting.  Want to confront her live in the air?  Yeah.  Can't confirm that.  All right.  Well, that was quite an interesting little display for the last two and a half hours, wouldn't you say?  Billy and Paul somehow got back upstairs.  Now they are leaving.  Could someone make sure they're gone? 
[03:08:30]  Jay has left.  He'll be at Rascals tonight.  Wow.  I'll tell you one thing, man.  I've been doing radio since I was 18.  That was the sickest thing I've ever been involved with.  Okay.  I had my doubts at one point because it was, like you said, getting too over the top.  But then, after going downstairs and then seeing the pummeling that the ear of Archie Bunker took of Jeff Norris. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  Everyone's out.  Everyone is out of the building.  Everyone's out of the building.  Let me see your ear, man.  Look at Jeff Norris' ear.  If you thought it was fake.  No, he took a punch.  The top.  Wow.  Dude, it's really swollen, man.  Look at it from the side.  Look at it.  I mean, both of them at once.  I'm not kidding, man.  Turn around.  It looks like an artichoke.  No, completely around.  So I can compare the ears.  All the way around.  All the way.  Oh.  And this guy's, you know, a brawler.  You know.  Yeah.  He's a judo champ. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  I would never mess with Jeff Norris.  Oh, jeez.  No, we can't discuss those.  So that was quite entertaining, to say the least.  It looked like they got close enough to each other to do some damage, but they didn't.  But you have to remember, they had like five guys.  There were guys holding arms back.  Holding arms, so they couldn't really swim.  Yeah.  Look at all the big, huge guys we had today.  That's right.  And that just happened.  Like, Steve came down, because he comes down for the unofficial website. 
[03:10:00]  We're going to have Jay in here and stuff, and you wanted to get the confrontation on videotape.  He's a big guy.  So, you know, he was here.  I don't know why you're here.  I don't know why you're here.  I'm kidding, man.  We don't need any more brawling.  Oh, come on.  It's a calling Earl.  All right.  Pal of the show.  So, Rick, everyone's gone?  Yeah.  Everybody's gone.  And the cops?  The cops are, I guess they let Fat Guy go, so they're probably gone.  All right.  That was insane down in the courtyard. 
[03:10:30]  Jay looked like he was going to rip a door off.  It was like high school.  It was like the Jets and the Sharks.  It was like Riff and Bernardo.  Riff and Nardo down at the playground.  Wow.  Unbelievable.  He punched the elevator door about six times on the way out.  Jay?  Jay was going to break the main.  Yeah, I know.  Did you see?  He was shaking, and he, like, had rage in his eyes.  I did security in Boston for six years.  It was a struggle holding Jay back.  Yeah, Steve was holding...  You were holding him back, too.  Yeah.  Steve, how much do you weigh, Steve? 
[03:11:00]  Just so people got a visual here.  310.  310.  And he's not fat.  No.  Not at all.  No.  Jay's like my size.  170, 175.  Jay was so pissed.  He's lighter than you, O.  He's lighter than me?  Oh, yeah.  What does he go?  160?  He was squirming.  He was off the ground.  They had him off the ground.  I picked him up off the courtyard.  Keep him from running forward.  Fred Flintstone starts his car.  That was amazing.  Who thought it would come to that? 
[03:11:30]  I knew it was going to get ugly.  That ugly?  Yeah, because as soon as I saw those guys, they were just so freaking pissed when we started  the whole thing.  I just knew something was going to be said that it was going to just make it.  Hold on.  That's why all the guys were in between.  Yesterday, or Friday, when was it that we took the call?  Yeah.  I didn't think it would get like this.  When Paul stuck his head in and was really pissed, that's what I'm saying.  I'm like, okay, then I thought it was going to get ugly, but that ugly?  Oh, yeah.  No.  Definitely.  I didn't think it would get to the point where they were going to start throwing it.  I had no doubt in my mind somebody was going to throw it today. 
[03:12:00]  No doubt.  And I know Fat Guy will just speak his mind.  So I was just waiting for that to happen.  When I first walked in, somebody said, they're going, they're going.  I was like, nah, come on, they're going to get out of here.  They're not going to go.  Yeah.  And sure as hell, man, they went a couple of minutes long.  Not for not either, Billy, Billy from Air City, he's no pushover either.  I played college ball, and I had to down block him like a tackle when he came to me.  He's a monster.  He's huge.  He's big.  All right, let's go to the phones.  Joe, what's going on?  Yo, that was the saddest thing I ever saw, man.  The saddest? 
[03:12:30]  Oh, it was freaking awful.  Why?  The guy's out there by himself.  Wait for you guys.  Poking on the cell phone by himself, dude.  Oh, what, Billy was by himself down there?  Pathetic.  So you saw the whole thing outside the Brooklyn Diner?  Dude, it looked like a little wart, man.  It was sad, really sad.  Yeah.  Bad news, Tom, man.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  All right.  There's someone that said it was real sad.  Let's go to Chuck.  Hey, Chuck, what's going on?  Hey.  Chuck.  Yeah, how are you guys doing?  That was the best ever.  That was insane. 
[03:13:00]  There was never any better.  I just want you to know I've been on hold for 45 minutes.  I see that.  Which is really good because I had to leave the car.  I couldn't listen to the rest.  So I'm like, oh, this rock.  So I'm like in the store and people are like, what are you doing?  I'm like, listen.  They're like, oh, it's today, right?  And they're like, yeah, yeah, today.  And they're like, oh, let me run out to my car.  So I'm like busy doing work, like listening, trying to like look important.  And I'm like sitting on hold.  I'll be like, yeah, sure.  Uh-huh.  No problem.  It was the best.  All right. 
[03:13:30]  I'm good.  All right.  Thank you, Chuck.  Leave me on hold now.  Glad you waited 45 minutes for that.  Yeah, I know.  It's pathetic.  Hey, and dealer Dave checking in from Long Island.  I hope Jay Moore has enough Xanax to get him through his show this evening.  Oh, my God.  Even Jay would laugh at that.  Come on.  Well, write that down.  You're goofing on Jay.  All right.  Uh, Dave, what's going on?  Oh, and hey, what's up?  How are you?  Yeah, I want to make sure you guys don't put these two pussies back on anytime soon.  Do I ask it, guys?  Yeah.  Because they got nothing back themselves. 
[03:14:00]  Jay Moore's been on Saturday, live.  He's been in all these movies.  What do these two guys got?  Nothing.  They got a couple of songs.  All right.  And some stupid shows.  All right.  Thank you, Dave.  All right.  Bye.  They throw a lot of weight around.  Purposely not defending Billion Paul.  Yeah, now we're going to have to...  I'm not going to defend them.  Now, you know something?  That was way out of left field.  I mean, I still don't totally understand the problem that they have with Jay.  And then the problem they have with us.  Jay comes in, like I said, at first they're accusing us of being starstruck and Jay taking 
[03:14:30]  shots at me and I don't defend myself against them.  I mean, Jay has given us how many days on end of a great radio?  Many.  And is it me saying that or is it the fact that people on the street and the calls and  the emails come in and just say it time and time again?  So, it's like guys hanging out.  If you goof on each other, you goof on each other.  Hey, you dick.  You're an ass.  What do we do when we're in L.A.?  It's a jerk off. 
[03:15:00]  Shut up, Ant.  You goof on each other.  That's what pals do.  But they're taking it all serious and like that they're pissed that Jay gets the airtime.  We don't care.  That's the difference with this show.  We don't care who gets the laugh, whether it's me, whether it's you, whether it's Jay  Moore.  Then he tries to hurt me by saying, you know, only comics with no hope.  I'm like, whatever, dude.  I know what I do for this radio show.  Yeah, like we haven't been around the comic community for years anyway.  I don't know because I'm not a comic.  That's what he was trying to say.  Yeah, believe me.  I don't have to be a mechanic to know a fast car, you know? 
[03:15:30]  You don't have to be on the inside to know when something goes by you that is fast.  You know what the funny thing is?  Everyone is waiting for us to yell April Fool's.  First of all, it's April 4th and this is no joke.  Believe me, people, it ain't it.  It ain't it.  I just shot in the arm.  It's no joke.  I don't even know who this is.  Ariel or something like that?  Yeah, that's me, Aurelis.  Aurelis, what's up?  Aurelis.  Hi, how are you?  What's up, baby?  Aurelis, where's your sister back team?  I've been sitting in my car for two hours. 
[03:16:00]  I don't even want to get out of the car because I'm listening to this.  It's unbelievable.  This was sick today.  I listen every single day and I run all my errands and I get out, I get in.  But today I've just been sitting in my parking spot with the radio on waiting to see what happens.  I think we made up for that Best of Show yesterday.  Wow.  It's so bad it got that out of control.  And knowing us, we'll replay this show ten times.  Definitely.  Oh, that's right, I'm not funny, sorry.  You're not in the comedy community.  I know, I won't try.  I'm sorry. 
[03:16:30]  I'm sorry I tried.  Well, thank you, Aurelis.  You guys agree.  Stealing from things, that's another thing.  Like, sometimes you just throw lines out when you're hanging out.  It's not like you're putting them in your act and ripping off people's monologues.  Joe from Jersey, Anthony?  I see fat people.  Oh, my God.  Sorry, I'm not supposed to be funny.  Let's segue into what they do.  What do they do?  What does our six main song parody, as it were?  Song parody.  Song parody.  Song parody.  Oh, is Joe going to stop?  Now Joe's going to stop, because he's got a song parody. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, man.  You know something?  When Jay was in here.  Oh, you got me.  Come on, Joe, start crying.  No, I'm not going to cry.  When that guy was crapping his big, fat, oversized diapers, I was writing parodies with you guys.  He had no right.  Absolutely no right.  I give my brother a greeting about plugging gigs.  Oh, and his song parody.  And Joe's the best, though.  And every time I mention, like, MP3 and The Rock Got Downloads, you can get on there.  See, see, look at the plug.  He's plugging.  I get grief.  I get grief.  It's like, here, plug some shows today.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:17:30]  Look at this.  Everyone's coming in the plug.  And they make it sound like we don't plug them, but every time we mention airsick production.  It's a lot.  And how many people have checked out their website because of us?  Yeah, a ton.  I hear it all the time.  And some of their songs are good.  Me and Cowbell Bill were talking about that.  I'm sorry.  Me and Cowbell Bill were talking about that.  How you guys constantly, I mean, you plug them quite a bit.  That's a plug every time they come on.  That's why I'm insulted, and I don't think I want them back on the air because I know what we have done for them.  And if they're ungrateful, then screw them.  I think we should be lenient and not dub them enemies of the show, which is very ugly when they're out in public. 
[03:18:00]  Hey, this just in, Joe from Jersey.  Hey, guys, we learned that the Van Halen dump button really works.  Oh, yeah.  That's a faithful listener because we told you guys a long time ago that someday the show is going to get so freaking ugly that they're going to take the show off the air.  John had to turn the key, man.  He turned the key.  The show had to go off the air.  Turn your key, sir.  Turn your key, sir.  In the middle of the fight, we ran out of delay because every other word was F-U-U-F-N-C-S. 
[03:18:30]  We ran out of dump.  He had to use executive precision.  Dancing in the street or something?  The Van Halen.  Scott's over here.  Oh, God.  Hey, it's 1969.  The show got so ugly, they had to turn the key and put the Van Halen on today.  I have never in my day.  The closest thing that comes to that, the thing that pops in my head, back in the 80s, Sam Kinison versus Bon Jovi.  And that wasn't even fists.  That was just yelling.  Right.  But this, I've never, ever heard anything like that. 
[03:19:00]  At one point, there was just a mob of people.  It had to be, I don't know, 10, 12 people in?  Yeah.  Just swaying from side to side in the studio.  Yeah.  Just bumping into everything.  All right.  Let's go to Steve.  Hey, Steve.  What's up?  Hey.  How are you?  Good.  I've got to agree with Anthony, man.  When you're hanging out with your friends and you say stuff, every time I say, that's a ticket, do I got to give John Lovitz credit?  Yeah.  Or if you go like you're hanging out at a bar with your buddies and you're like, okay, terrific. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah.  Like, do they turn around and start, now what are you doing?  I've seen Jay.  I went to see him down the shore.  My girlfriend's going again tonight.  It's the most original material I've ever heard a comic do.  To tell you the truth, it's about his life.  It's original.  And it's knocked down funny.  He's very, very funny.  I don't see what the problem is.  He's very funny.  And I've got to say, you guys, today was some of the best radio.  And I knew last week when Billy called, I heard that and I said, I've got to listen Tuesday.  It's going to be the funniest show I've ever heard.  You know, I've got to give props to Billy and Paul. 
[03:20:00]  Their last appearance, probably the best show we've done in New York.  Probably the best, most entertaining show we've done in New York.  You guys tried your best with them.  You maintained, you gave them opportunities.  They shouldn't even call the show anymore.  Cut your losses and end on top.  You're never going to beat what you guys did today.  That almost sounds like enemy of the show.  Very close to enemy of the show.  But no, I think we pull back.  And I are too soft.  You know, we give people an opportunity here.  We do plug their gigs and do plug their websites. 
[03:20:30]  And then they S on us.  Well, you know Jay Moore can carry himself.  He's funny.  And he gives you guys great radio.  And you, in turn, give him great plugs.  And he did that with AirSick.  I never heard of AirSick before your show.  Thank you.  And all the day holding short on the runway with the atomic bomb in his belly.  Not quite taking off.  But at any time, her engines can ride alive and Colonel Pivots can drop the bomb.  Thank you, Steve.  Guys, you're great.  All right.  And Gay Marco checking in from Homoland. 
[03:21:00]  Don't hurt my baby.  That's all it says.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  I think Mr. Norris has something to say real quick before he goes.  Yeah, I'm on my way out.  Are you leaving?  Oh, Jeff, are you going to fight anyone?  He's got his plug, so he's going to...  Yeah, I thought this worked out pretty good for me.  Oh, come on with your plug.  No, check out this plug.  Check out an opportunity to do Rascals tonight with Jay Moore.  How cool is that?  I swear to God, Jay gave him a few minutes tonight.  You take a punch for Jay Moore and he puts you on the ticket.  Hey, Jay, if you're listening, you're not going to write any bullseye in my ass, pal. 
[03:21:30]  Well, Jeff, go down there to Rascals tonight and kick ass with your five minutes.  Yeah, hey.  Jay Moore and Billy, you know, I worked with Paul a lot, so, you know, no hard feelings,  but I'm going to end on that note, Jay, and for everyone giving self-plugs, I was the first  guest on Open Antoinette.  All right, Jeff, have fun with Rascals tonight.  Take it easy, Jeff.  Look at Jeff, that looks like a little schoolgirl. 
[03:22:00]  Look at him.  That's going to be a packed house, man.  Yeah.  You are playing in front of some people tonight.  With a cauliflower ear.  Yeah, you can show that off, man.  People are going to want to see your ear.  You look like Barney Rubble.  All right, Benny, what's going on?  Imagine that.  Hold on, Benny.  Hold on, Benny.  Jay was involved, and you got hit in the...  Right ear.  Right ear.  Right, right, right, right.  You got hit right in the ear.  Your ear?  You got hit in your ear?  Right in the ear.  No, right in the ear?  I'm not pointing that.  So you were holding Jay back at that?  So Jay was behind you, and you got one in your ear. 
[03:22:30]  Got a fist in your ear.  Actually, I...  A fist in your ear?  I'm going to sue everybody.  All right.  Thank you.  Benny, what's going on?  How's it going, boy?  Your ear's all red.  Riveting radio.  Yeah, that was interesting, to say the least.  Green eye.  I hoped for traffic.  Oh, cool.  Green eye of envy on those guys.  They're envious.  I don't know.  No, that seemed...  That was very, very weird on their part.  I really didn't think they were like that. 
[03:23:00]  I know.  Out of control.  All right, Benny.  Thank you.  Good stuff.  Good stuff.  Thank you.  Okay.  Let's dig into a quick round of what do we learn on the Open Anthony show today as  we try to wrap up the show here, Anthony.  Wow.  Poor brother.  He brings down parodies, and there's a brawl.  Well...  Yeah, stop crying.  You know, if Jay wasn't here, I would have gotten my parodies on.  Yeah, really.  All right.  And in all fairness, you heard these two songs that your brother Joe did, and you said they  could be contenders in the most offensive song contest.  Absolutely. 
[03:23:30]  That Mike DiNicola invented.  Yeah.  Mike DiNicola.  What happened to Mike?  He left with Jay.  Yeah, where did Mike go?  He left with Jay.  He was really pissed off.  I was amazed.  Mike, ready to jump into the fray.  But I was amazed that they were attacking Mike DiNicola.  He had nothing to do with it.  Yeah, why?  Just because he's friends with Jay.  Just because he fell on a bit for our radio show.  He came up with the FBA song, and then we decided to make a most offensive song contest,  so he's getting a lot of publicity off that.  And the weird thing is, because of his song, they were able to get their song on and got 
[03:24:00]  a lot of response from it.  The Kilafeeta song.  Right.  Which they've sent to many radio stations, by the way.  They have.  Other stations are playing it.  Are you serious?  But they talk about Jay, how he does other radio shows.  Okay.  Good.  Yeah.  And so you heard Joe's songs?  Yes.  And they're outstanding?  Yeah.  Definitely.  They're going to be contenders tomorrow when we play them?  Unbelievable.  Joe, I swear.  No, I know. 
[03:24:30]  Now that we have syndicated shows and stuff, we cannot go late anymore.  So I'm just going to have to come back tomorrow.  Maybe just throw the title out as a little, uh, Boned My Daughter.  Boned My Daughter is the first one.  As in the Pearl Jam song?  Yes.  Okay.  And I ain't saying the other one.  You can't.  You really can't.  No, no, you can't.  Oh, mine, Fuhrer.  Done to Old MacDonald.  Done to, yes, to Old MacDonald. 
[03:25:00]  Something to look forward to on tomorrow's show.  Anthony put me up to the challenge, and I answered, yes.  All right.  I pulled out all the stops.  All right.  Let's, uh, let's play.  Look at it, and I win, man.  I win when I get in it.  I'm not going to take anything from the fat bastard.  My sack of onions.  Mike from Queens.  What I learned today.  Come on, let's go.  Let's go.  Today I learned that the dump button really works.  A bunch of people were on hold that whole time. 
[03:25:30]  They said they heard the unedited show, and they said it was even more unbelievable.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  Oh, it was on, I, boy, did we get that at least on that?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And we, the whole thing, fight and everything.  I'm sure there's going to be a bunch of that up on FoundryMusic.com.  And the video, yeah, I got to review that over, and I see a cold, frosty one in the office, please.  I swear, I thought, um, I was glad Mark was filming the whole thing down there, because  I had to throw my camera in a bush at one point, and, uh, pulled Jay off of, uh, Billy. 
[03:26:00]  Okay, jealousy.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, jealousy.  Okay, terrific.  Whoa!  Okay.  All right, we got to go fast here.  Uh, Steve, what's going on?  What did you learn on the show today?  Yo, I was on hold for that whole thing, man.  Yeah.  Yo, that was unbelievable.  I got the whole unedited thing.  I love being on hold on your show.  And that, Billy, nothing but a fat, jealous rubber hole.  And you can use that word, okay?  Because I don't want to make sure you don't have any problems with it. 
[03:26:30]  Rub a hole.  You'll allow us to steal that.  All right, thank you.  Later, guys.  Bye.  Let's go to Don.  Uh, Don, what did you learn on the show today?  Don.  Or Don, or Dick, or John, or Pete, or Paul, or Mary.  Yeah, who's this?  John.  All right, John.  Hey, John, we hit one.  What did you learn on the show today?  I learned that Stone Temple Pilots is going to be performing at Rascals tonight and tomorrow  at Irving Plaza.  I forgot all about that.  Boy, the whole show started on a bang, huh? 
[03:27:00]  I forgot that we gave away the Stone Temple Pilots show for tomorrow night.  That another station is going to be announcing tomorrow morning.  Very good.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  All right.  Uh, Kevin from Lindenhurst.  I learned the true meaning of train wreck radio today.  Uh, let's go to, let's go to Rob.  Hey, Rob, what did you learn today?  Hey, uh, I learned Jay Moore's got a pretty good left.  I'll stand it right there.  Oh, you saw the whole thing down there?  Yep.  He's got a nice body ball right there.  All right, cool.  Yeah, he's got other body blows, too. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah.  Uh, Brendan, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  I learned that Paul is, uh, definitely Billy's bitch.  That was a little odd.  That was a little weird.  Paul asking Billy if he could, uh, take the slot at Rascals tonight.  Uh, and Billy said over my dead body and told him he cannot perform, uh, with Jay Moore  tonight.  That was a little weird.  I think they're really gay lovers.  All right.  Thank you.  Lovers.  That's a little rough, man.  All right.  Let's go to, uh, Paul.  Paul, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How's it going? 
[03:28:00]  Hey.  Hey.  I learned that, uh, Billy invented comedy.  Ooh.  Uh, Billy invented comedy?  Where are you going?  I wrecked your line.  I'm sorry.  That's pretty funny.  That's all right, guys.  By the way, I think it's, like, unfair that, you know, Paul's going to get the bum rap  over here, because Billy's the prick.  Yeah, well, we'll sort it out tomorrow.  It's just too crazy right now.  Got to let it simmer.  All right, guys.  All right, thank you.  Who gives a crap?  Well, that is...  See you later, Paul.  And can you imagine...  And can you imagine if you or I went to the other person and said, we... 
[03:28:30]  You can't do something?  Yeah, I know.  That's a little weird.  Can't do that.  I don't care who you are.  That's a little weird.  Over my dead body.  Uh, so...  Yeah, when you wanted to do the, uh, gay porno, I was like...  Feel free.  You are.  Oh, you got me.  See, I'm not a comedian, so I don't have a comeback.  I'll just take it like a man.  Uh, Sean from Westchester.  That's what you did in the movie.  Ah.  Ah.  It was your father. 
[03:29:00]  Oh, come on.  He's dead.  Leave him alone, man.  I know.  That's what makes it funny.  There's two of us in the room now.  Oh, yeah.  What am I still doing?  Come on, man.  I'm sorry.  That's a low blow.  Uh, Sean from Westchester.  I did a movie.  Get me out of this.  Hey!  Sean from Westchester.  I learned that the rock show a while back was a love fest compared to today.  Yeah.  That is the truth.  All right.  And, uh, Sean on line nine.  He learned that today's better than WrestleMania. 
[03:29:30]  Um.  Oh, this guy knows what Van Halen song played.  We'll end with this.  Eric, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, man.  Ain't Talkin' About Love is the most appropriate dumb song for today.  It was Ain't Talkin' About Love?  All right.  All right.  So, Eric, what happened?  When did they cut the show?  Because when?  Well, I knew it was coming.  I was sitting there.  I knew it was coming.  I'm like, okay, it's going to happen now.  Because I heard everyone getting up.  And then, all of a sudden, Kate, Talkin' About Love.  But how much of the fight was on the air?  Because you could really hear it.  No, you heard a lot of it.  It came back.  Oh, a lot of it.  Good. 
[03:30:00]  It came back.  We both did.  And then, uh, and then you hear it again.  And then you went to the commercial.  No, it's a chance, man.  You guys both.  We see it.  What's the difference?  What's the difference?  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Come on.  Come on.  Stupid.  You're so stupid.  Come in.  Come in. 
[03:30:30]  Virgin.  Okay.  Terrific.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Julie, what's up?  I nearly drove off the road listening to you guys today, and then I'm waiting to pay the  toll at Exit 109, and I can see that the toll taker is pissing himself. 
[03:31:00]  He's laughing so hard he can't even, like, do his job.  Oh, amazing.  So, I, you know, I'm just going to try not to get killed from now on listening to you guys.  Thank you.  Okay.  Bye.  All right.  Let's go to John.  John, what's going on?  What did you learn on the show today?  I learned that the show kicks ass when the stock market takes a dime.  And I hope it happens more often.  I mean, I know it's a blow to your wallets and everything, but the show, I think there's  a direct correlation, is all I'm saying.  Yeah, I think everyone was a little tense today because of the market, and we got some 
[03:31:30]  anger out today.  Thank you, John.  Billy lost tens of dollars today.  Hey, that's it.  All right, we've really got to get the hell out of here, man.  Hey!  Damn, what a day.  Don't forget, Stone Temple Pilots playing Irving Plaza tomorrow night.  Oh, yay.  Big announcement on a certain morning show tomorrow, but that's the announcement.  And as we leave, Anthony, we've got to thank the WWF for giving us that fine trip to L.A.  Yeah.  We came back, obviously, well-rested and ready to go.  Obviously.  And right now, let's blow out some tickets. 
[03:32:00]  So we got tickets, a three-pack of tickets to the WWF event at the Garden, April 15th.  I believe you'll be on hand for that, warming up the crowd.  Warming up the crowd?  Yeah, so.  In the ring, really?  Yeah.  Wow, that's scary.  Screw us.  Let's get that fat guy in the ring, man.  The main event, a bone hole match.  Airsick production, by the way, opening tonight for Andrew Dice Clay at Laugh Your Balls Off.  Oh, no.  Hey, come on.  But then again, I'm not funny.  So, 10th caller gets the wrestling tickets, Anthony. 
[03:32:30]  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  And with that, we step aside for Don and Mike.  What the hell are we going to do tomorrow?  You're going to play my song parodies, is what you're going to do.  Yeah, we're going to play Joe's great song parodies.  Anthony says they could definitely be contenders.  Definitely contenders, but he might have ripped people off and stuff.  Smart ass.  And good luck to Don and Mike.  Try to follow that.  Opie, you scum, and Anthony.  Your new name is Dick. 
[03:33:00]  Opie and Anthony.  What changed you into such a demonic little bastard?  1-0-2-7-6-0.  W-N-E-W.  W-N-E-W. </pre>
