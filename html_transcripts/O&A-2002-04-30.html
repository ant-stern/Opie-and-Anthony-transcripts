<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a caller describing a bizarre LSD-induced hallucination involving a sentient hot dog.  The hosts then transitioned into a lengthy discussion about their own experiences with outdated and bizarre educational films.  These films covered various topics, including drug abuse prevention (featuring the recurring "Kicksville" reference), sex education (with awkward depictions of menstruation and the recurring "porch swing" analogy), and public safety (including train safety and atomic bomb drills).  The hosts and callers shared numerous anecdotes and reactions to these films, with frequent use of offensive and crude language.  The hosts also promoted an upcoming celebrity softball game and a promotional event with Black Earl and Frenchie.  No in-studio guests were explicitly mentioned during this portion.

The show then shifted to a discussion of the show's low ratings on WNEW, their flagship New York City radio station.  They speculated about potential format changes (Spanish, light AC, or country music),  a possible move to K-Rock, and expressed their disdain for several station executives ("Abercrombie and Fitch midget" and "Tom the douche").  They contrasted their low New York ratings with strong performance in other markets, criticizing a newspaper articleâ€™s speculation about the station's future and its coverage of minor radio events.  The possibility of a country format led to humorous speculation about Earl Douglas's ("Colored Earl") reaction.  A phone sex operator called in, but their offer was rejected.  Tina was scheduled for a later "fake O" segment.  The hosts also discussed annoying internet pop-up ads and an ad-removal program, interacting humorously with co-worker Steve.  They mentioned the Islanders-Maple Leafs hockey game and promised to play audio clips from the educational films. This segment was also rife with homophobic and racist slurs.


Next, the hosts played and discussed audio clips from vintage educational films about menstruation and puberty, featuring a girl named Libby and her mother.  They provided graphic descriptions and sexually suggestive comments.  A caller, Jared (later identified as John from Cleveland), sought advice on explaining menstruation to his eight-year-old daughter, receiving irreverent and inappropriate suggestions from the hosts.  The show included their "F.U. Line," featuring angry callers.  They also discussed a news story about a vice principal checking students' underwear at a school dance and a fraternity's alleged animal abuse of a pig, both discussed with sexually charged humor. Opie shared a personal anecdote about a drunken encounter with a large woman, and a song by John Valby satirizing Catholic priests was played. The broadcast concluded with promotion of "Whip Them Out Wednesday," encouraging listeners to display a "WOW" sticker, and upcoming live events, including the celebrity softball game.  Listener calls offering "What did I learn today?" feedback further commented on the show's content.  No in-studio guests besides the hosts and numerous callers were mentioned.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I first dropped acid when I was 18. I was over at these people's house one night.  This guy I went to school with was over there and asked me if I wanted to try some acid.  I had read about it in the newspapers and heard a few friends talk about it, so I was curious.  I was pretty jacked up on marijuana, so I decided to try it, and I dropped it.  I don't know what I was waiting for, a flash or a rush or whatever,  but I kept sitting there waiting and waiting and nothing was happening. 
[00:00:30]  So I got up and then went to the dresser and put on a pair of pink capris and a green and brown blouse.  I thought the colors were beautiful.  So we tripped down to Market Street and I decided to buy a hot dog.  I was very hungry.  And I had put mustard and ketchup and relish in the usual. 
[00:01:00]  And I put the hot dog up to my mouth and somebody started screaming.  I didn't know what was happening, so I looked up at my friend Terry and said,  Did you hear that? Didn't you hear someone scream?  He said no.  I got the hot dog up to my mouth again.  And I was ready to bite.  And the scream got louder.  And it hit me. 
[00:01:30]  No, it couldn't be.  And I looked down at the hot dog and there was a face on him.  Eyes, nose, a mouth.  I had put the ketchup to where it looked like his hair.  And he started telling me that I couldn't eat him.  And he had a wife and seven kids at home to support.  And I stood there with this hot dog and asked Terry,  Do you know this hot dog is talking to me?  And he says, Nah, let's get out of here. 
[00:02:00]  He thought I was just faking.  And I told him, Look at the thing.  He's got a face.  And he's screaming.  And the guy finally looked over and he got on the same trip that I was on.  And we sat there carrying on a conversation with that hot dog.  Finally, I decided I was just hallucinating.  So I put it in my mouth and bit down.  It screamed so loud that you could hear it all over town. 
[00:02:30]  So I had to throw it on the ground and step on it.  And I was jumping on this hot dog in the middle of Market Street.  I realized that I had murdered it.  And I took off screaming down the street. 
[00:03:00]  Scared.  Marijuana is the bomb.  Marijuana is the bomb. 
[00:03:30]  Well, make up your mind.  Drop your acid, people.  It's time for the opium.  This is your appointment.  Right.  Okay, terrific.  That's right.  Hey, man, save me a bug.  Drop your acid.  Drink, drink, drink.  That was a good impression.  Drink, drink, drink. 
[00:04:00]  And welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I was very hungry, and I put my shit ketchup and relish as usual.  The hot dog had a face.  That is some strung out bitch.  That's some good ass.  Yeah.  Couple phone numbers in the New York City area, Anthony.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere outside of New York City, including Anthony.  Yes.  Got to do it again. 
[00:04:30]  Buffalo, New York.  Hello.  I say Buffalo because they represented the O.P. and Anthony Show big time on WWF last night  on Raw.  Yes.  Wow signs all over the place.  Great.  As they were trying to do their little TV show.  So, for Buffalo and anyone else outside of the New York area, 866-277-4WOW.  That's 866-277-4WOW.  Hi.  If I was a hot dog, I sure wouldn't want to be in the hands of that strung out bitch. 
[00:05:00]  She bit my head off and threw me on the ground.  Hi.  Hey, that was a poor hot dog.  How could you not feel bad for a hot dog like that?  Probably bit right in and broke his big glass.  I love it.  That was hilarious.  That was an educational film, kids.  Yeah, we love them.  Don't do LSD.  See what happens?  Hmm, jumping up and down on a hot dog. 
[00:05:30]  She said she was jumping up and down on a hot dog in the middle of Market Street.  Wow.  Well, yeah, whatever gets you off.  There, honey.  We were show prepping today for the Opie and Anthony show, and we came across some educational films.  That one was on LSD.  Very funny.  We will be playing some others as the week goes by here.  Drug ones are great.  The drug ones are hilarious.  The hot one.  Barbiturates.  One guy, the drug dealer, looked like Tom Hanks after he was stuck on the island for a little while. 
[00:06:00]  He had the big beard going.  And the other guy was the blonde-haired guy from Emergency.  As a kid.  Was the young, innocent lad.  Yeah, he was the lad that they corrupted with their drugs.  That took a turn somewhere for the worse.  For the worse.  Had some hot chick, you know, flirting with him.  Yeah.  Trying to get him hooked on H.  Because she was in cahoots with the guy.  Like, the plot line was the Tom Hanks with the beard guy was trying to turn on all the innocent kids. 
[00:06:30]  All the squares.  All the squares.  Take a trip from Squaresville.  That's what he said.  Right.  Take a trip from Squaresville.  You'll be gone, gone, and far out.  Right.  Like, the talk is fantastic.  But the square kid's like, hey, man, you know, I have more fish to hook.  Yeah.  More fish to hook.  He can't be bothered with the drug scene.  Mm-hmm.  Well, he turned, man.  Take a high ride to Kicksville.  That's what he said.  Know what I learned?  Kicksville.  I want to go to Kicksville.  Know what I learned during that educational film about marijuana, Anthony? 
[00:07:00]  Or that was the one on H?  That was on LSD.  That was the LSD one as well?  That was LSD.  The good drugs were in the garage.  In the garage.  That's when they went to the garage.  Where they could hide away from grown-ups and authority figures.  And do their drugs.  And get strung out and high, far gone.  But they were doing the drugs in the regular playroom there.  They were drinking.  It was a typical house party, weren't they?  Just drinking.  They weren't smoking a little...  No, they were drinking beers. 
[00:07:30]  And the guy from emergency was making out with the hot slut chick that was in cahoots  with the dealer.  Mrs. Robinson.  She was a little older.  She was a little older.  But they were kissing on the couch, and that's when she gained his trust.  Right.  If he could only see the needle marks on her arm or her police record, he'd know to get  far, far away from this scene.  That's what they were saying.  It was great.  So they talked him into going in the garage for the good stuff.  Yeah.  And then he went to the garage, and that's when he caved in to peer pressure.  Right.  And took a trip to Kicksville. 
[00:08:00]  Kicksville.  Kicksville.  Isn't that out on Long Island?  Right?  That's by Mineola or something?  Where is Kicksville?  That's Hicksville.  Oh, Hicksville.  I'm sorry.  Take a trip to Hicksville on the LIRR.  It was great.  We were laughing our balls off.  And then the one where we were really screaming out, we had Mary, and we had other girls watching.  Lee.  Lee was in there watching, too.  Yeah.  And it was on a chick's first period.  Yeah.  How funny, man. 
[00:08:30]  This chick is like, they were talking about menstruation.  She was like 12 years old, and her other friend was 12, but she was more mature.  Right.  Your friend is more mature than you.  You might not get your time for another year or two.  And then they said, later that summer, and you see the same 12-year-old girl, she's sitting  in the chair.  She goes, mother, I have something to tell you.  And the mother just looks at her and goes, you're menstruating.  You're menstruating.  She goes, how did you know?  And we're all making jokes, because the couch was white when you sat on it. 
[00:09:00]  She's sitting on a red couch.  There's the cats licking at it.  Dude, this tape was hilarious.  Very funny.  And then the mother gives a demonstration of how to put on the wackiest contraption for  a pad I've ever seen.  Let's be careful so they don't dump out the feminine product there.  It's Modeste, feminine napkins.  Boy, they were a lot different back in 1958. 
[00:09:30]  Too damn funny.  She gives the box to the daughter, and it was like as big as a Nike box.  It was like a Nike box.  It was like a Nike sneaker box, and I think there was one in there.  There was one pad.  She brings it out, and she goes, and here's the belt.  And she picks up this belt.  She goes, you wear it under your panties.  And she shows how to put the pad on the belt.  The short end.  It's like you're doing mechanics on a truck.  The short end.  And she is attaching the short flap end.  And then there's the big, thick, absorbent pad. 
[00:10:00]  And then there's another flap end that's a long end.  And she's putting it in this thing that looks like a paper clip hanging from the front of  the thing.  And then she puts the long end to the back.  Know what it looked like when the mom had the contraption all figured out?  And then she holds it up.  It looked like a porch swing.  Yeah, yeah.  It did.  She picks it up, and it was gently swinging.  The pad back and forth.  And she goes, won't it leak?  No.  The mother goes, no.  It's made of absorbent material.  You change it every three or four hours throughout the day. 
[00:10:30]  It was the best.  It was hilarious.  It was the best.  Well, we're going to get more audio from these tapes.  Yeah.  They're so much fun.  Oh, my God.  We were dying.  We were dying.  Now the boys can learn to earn their red wings at school.  Now I'll tell you about crime scene sex.  Oh, the simplest Italian guy.  Oh, it's the most racist film I've ever seen. 
[00:11:00]  There's this Italian guy.  He works at a bakery, I guess.  Why not?  And his name is on the front of the store.  You know, Enzo or whatever the hell it was.  And he gets out and he paints N-Sun on the bottom of the window because he's having a little  a bambino, as he said.  A little a boy.  And he paints N-Sun, S-U-N.  And there's people scratching their heads going, you spell son with an O.  Ah, with an O.  Really?  Like this dumb Guinea, this right off the boat, ignorant Guinea immigrant. 
[00:11:30]  And he's all excited because the doctor comes over to deliver the baby in the bakery.  So he goes in the back room and Enzo, whatever his name is, he's waiting, playing the accordion.  He's all happy.  Ring, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  He's playing his Italian music.  The doctor comes out.  First thing he does, lights up his cigarette.  Oh, boy.  And his head is hanging.  He's all depressed.  Oh, boy.  And the Italian guy's like, what's the matter?  Is my Elizabeth okay?  Is my bambino okay?  Your baby's dead. 
[00:12:00]  It was born dead.  It was born dead.  It had syphilis.  You and your wife have syphilis.  Your baby died of syphilis.  And then the Italian guy goes lunging for a bread knife to stab himself with him.  With medical advancements today, we can cure syphilis.  You must come down to the hospital with your wife and you'll be able to have all the healthy, fine bambinos you want.  Great, great, old, politically incorrect drivel.  I love it. 
[00:12:30]  Rick, could you get more audio?  Yeah, we could.  I mean, I know you're working on Ecstasy Dad.  Yeah, Ecstasy Dad's got some great clips.  But that whole scene with the garage and the lady trying to get the guy from Emergency Hooked is hilarious.  All you need is some of the narrators.  The rap right in the beginning when the drug dealer comes to the groovy car.  When he says, take our ride to Kicksville.  Yeah, the groovy guy comes to the car to try to turn him on.  He goes, he's been away from town, but he's back.  Little does anyone know he was in prison. 
[00:13:00]  And the guy looks like Tom Hanks with the beard.  And back then they blamed it on the parents as well.  Yeah, they did.  The parents, because the kid went home because he had to study and he went home to actually talk to his dad about certain things.  But the parents weren't there.  They left him a note.  They weren't there for him.  And they said the parents weren't there for him.  So he went to the party and had a good time.  He wasn't going to be a square.  He drank the alcohol and danced the night away.  Then went to the garage.  Besides, you can't get hooked doing it one time. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, that's what you go.  Sure, you won't get hooked doing it one time.  But I am Rock Quarry.  That's exactly what they sound like.  That's what they sound like.  It's probably the same guy that did the voice.  I mean, it sounds like him.  Well, the film's supposed to be by Troy McClure.  Yeah, that's the voice, dude.  That's absolutely what they sounded like.  Some great stuff.  Let's go to Andrew.  Hey, Andrew.  Andrew.  Hey, I'm sorry.  I was eating something.  Oh, that's all right.  What's up?  Was it a hot dog with a face? 
[00:14:00]  Remember in grammar school when the cops would come to the auditorium and they'd show you  all the drugs?  They'd pull them out of a bag?  That wanted you to do drugs after that.  Yeah.  They'd tell you what everything did.  This one will make you fast.  This one will make you dopey, get drunk.  It was great.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They actually brought a little briefcase to school.  They thought they were doing a good thing, but it was a commercial.  Like, hey, if you want to be a little slower, a little faster, try this, try that.  You want to forget about your parents for a while?  Try this. 
[00:14:30]  Great stuff.  Cool.  All right, Andrew.  Take care.  Bye.  And we learned barbiturates are more addicting than H.  Yes, more addicting than heroin.  The kid's just sitting there talking about his experience with the barbs, the barbiturates.  Because, sure, heroin's hard to kick with the nausea.  What's this guy breathing so heavy for?  I don't know.  Hey, Frank.  Yeah.  What's up, Frank?  Hey.  Hey, you guys might have struck all with this stuff.  I was thinking back.  This, the hot dog movie, I heard it on the radio. 
[00:15:00]  I flipped out.  I had a flashback, maybe sixth grade, I don't know, fifth grade.  They showed that movie.  And from that day on, I was with that hot dog, talks to the chicken.  I remember, like, you know, goes to the floor, there's mustard and ketchup on the floor.  Well, what it was.  The freak time runs out.  I want, ever since I've seen that, I couldn't wait to try that drug.  Yeah, didn't it seem like a pretty cool drug to try?  I was like, oh, my God.  Wait, there's something you can take that makes a hot dog come to life?  Oh.  I mean, and I did.  I was looking from that day on.  I mean, I tried that before I even smoked weed. 
[00:15:30]  Isn't it great?  I wish I could find it today.  All right, Frank.  Thank you.  Good luck.  Bye.  The picture that they showed during that woman eating the hot dog was a little troll doll in a bun.  Yeah.  And it had a face.  I threw it to the ground and jumped on a hot dog in the middle of Market Street.  I named him George Glass.  George Glass.  That's what the voice was, right?  It's George Glass.  I bit his head off.  Ginny, what's going on?  Hey.  Oh, hey. 
[00:16:00]  What up?  What up, man?  Listen, if you think that stuff was weird from your end, watching the movie, you should have been wetting that stuff.  I'm dead.  It was very weird.  You wore the porch swing?  Oh, baby.  I mean, it was like having a diaper on.  Really?  And here I am, 11 years old now.  When you're 11 years old, you were still trying to learn how to throw the baseball over the top of your house.  Yeah.  Your mother, you know, or your friend.  And I'm like, Ma, what is this?  You know, let's pull down the conception of it. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, your phone is really bad.  Call back if you get a better line.  Yeah, the old, uh, it's the old gear they used to have to wear, Opie.  Big belt and harnesses and clips and clips and tape.  You're clipping things on.  It's just pulling things through loops.  Through the paper clip-like loops to hold it.  The short end and the long end.  You know what?  Someone's got to start taping what goes on in that back office.  Because the comments we were making.  Yeah, we were having a lot of fun back there today.  That's for sure. 
[00:17:00]  The chick was having the mother-daughter, uh, you know, talking.  A little discussion.  And she was all bummed because she was starting to menstruate.  Menstruation.  And we were, like, doing the dialogue of what the mom should say to the daughter.  This is when you're going to learn to give hummers.  Hummers.  Don't worry, Susie.  During this time.  Right.  That's why sometimes it's called a period.  That's what she was saying.  Because it's at a certain time every month.  And then the girls are at the pool.  And one girl comes up and she goes, oh, you're talking about the curse. 
[00:17:30]  And the girl's like, oh, gee.  I'll call it the curse.  The curse.  Or when we feel bad.  Oh, man.  The curse.  Frank, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Ann, why does your narrator voice sound like Bob Murphy doing a mech game?  No, Bob Murphy's like this.  Well, he was like a young Bob Murphy.  Very clagged nose.  It says things like a high fly ball.  Deep center bill.  That one easily caught you in the inning. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, wait.  It's a home run?  We've got to play the clip now.  Can we get that clip?  Deep egg by Andy going back.  He's gone.  A home run.  A home run.  Oh, wait.  He caught it.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  Clueless.  All right, Frank.  We've got to get the Kicksville line.  Got to.  Kicksville.  Tim, what's up?  Yeah, listen, guys.  I took a look at the map.  Yeah?  And Kicksville is right next to Baja, California.  Can you get tortillas there? 
[00:18:30]  Absolutely.  If you take enough acid, you can get anything you want.  Well, they dodge you.  All right, Tim.  Thank you.  Take care, guys.  All right.  Here's Bob Murphy screwing up a call, Anthony.  Yeah, let's listen.  The Mets announcer.  The pitch.  High fly ball.  And it keeps the left center field.  It's way back.  It may be playable.  Agmayani can't get a play.  It's gone.  A home run.  Oh, he caught it.  He caught it at the wall.  I was unsure.  He was unable to reach it.  It's caught by Agmayani. 
[00:19:00]  I apologize.  He was way out there, and it didn't look like he had a play on it.  But he caught it against the wall in left center field.  That just tells me he can't see.  No, no, he can't.  Mr. Magoo.  That one, a high fly ball deep to center field.  It looks like, yes, he caught it.  At the end of the inning, we can now go.  Oh, wait.  The lawnmowers are out there?  The game isn't starting yet.  Wait.  I'm in my backyard?  The guy can't see.  My day off?  What happened? 
[00:19:30]  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey, Mikey.  Hey, I got that.  If you think those are pretty silly videos, the healthy ones, try watching a Navy video.  Oh, yeah.  I got some Navy ones from the 60s and 70s.  Oh, yeah.  Well, this one that I'm thinking of was called the first 72 hours, kind of like a day in the  life of a new recruit reporting on board a ship.  Yeah.  And the first day show that no one is waiting for him at the quarterdeck, and he gets into  the wrong crowd, and he goes out drinking all night, then he winds up going to Captain 
[00:20:00]  Mess and gets kicked out of the Navy at the end.  He gets kicked out?  Yeah, he gets kicked out because of drinking, and he's doing drugs and the whole bit, but  just like the whole narration, you know, it's just like, oh, my God.  And me and the guys are just like cracking up, laughing, doing our own little comments  and stuff, too.  Yeah, it's kind of like you're forced into a Mystery Science Theater 3000 kind of thing  when you're watching these at your buds, because it's just too funny.  You've got to goof on it.  Oh, it's hysterical.  It's hysterical. 
[00:20:30]  That's the only way to pass the time with some of these pathetic videos.  Yes, sir.  It's great, guys, to hear you, and keep up the great job.  Thanks, Mike.  No problem.  Thank you, guys.  Just keep your fingers crossed, because rumor has it we're going country.  Country.  John from D.C. brought up that SNL commercial parody.  Have you seen it?  No.  It's called Kotex Classics, and they do a whole thing on them bringing back the belts  and the pants, and the girls are wearing these tight, slinky dresses, and you just see these 
[00:21:00]  big bulges of the pad, the belt.  You know how girls wear their thongs kind of pulled out of the top of their pants?  Yeah.  The big white belt is coming out of the top.  It's hysterical.  It was one of the funniest SNL commercial parodies I've ever seen.  Classic.  Really good.  With that said, why don't we play Stephen Lynch?  Yeah.  It's a nice little song about menstruating.  Sure.  All right, and we'll be back.  Yeah, we might be going country here in New York is the latest rumor.  Oh, great.  We'll give you the latest on that and other things on the way.  This is an old traditional Irish song, and it's usually passed down from father to son 
[00:21:30]  when the boy's on the verge of manhood.  And it's called Down to the Old Pub Instead.  Ah.  And I'd like to play it for you tonight.  Thank you.  That it's your duty to find your lass with childbearing hips in a pink suple lass  and make her your wife and lover with love so true. 
[00:22:00]  Now, some rivers run high, some rivers run low.  When her river runs red, then she's starting her flow.  And it's called menstruation.  Here's what it means to you.  You will notice her bloomers are spotty at first.  Stand back.  Her ovarian dam's gonna burst.  Son, don't be afraid.  It's a natural thing.  Just wad up some cotton in hand or a string.  And put the old linens on top of the bed.  Get out of the house and go down to the old pub instead. 
[00:22:30]  Hundreds of years old.  That's why bloomers.  Aye.  Aye.  She'll retain her water.  Her breasts will be tender.  Say something nice and you're sure to offend her.  Get out of the house and go down to the old pub instead.  She'll want to make love if you do.  You're a fool.  You'll only end up with a bloody old tool.  Now, get out of the house. 
[00:23:00]  Go down to the old pub instead.  She'll want you to sample the fruit of her loins.  But, son, it'll taste like some old rusty coins.  So, turn off the light and take off your hat and drop to your knees.  Say a prayer to St. Pat.  That'll give you the strength to get out of the bed.  And for Ireland's sake, go down to the old pub instead.  I feel a solo coming on.  Oh, really?  Perhaps right here, Anthony. 
[00:23:30]  Very good.  Now, the pub is the place where the lads are a-meeting  When the moon is full and the gals are a-bleeding  The Catholic, the Protestant, even the pagan  The pub is the place when your lady is ragging  So, drink of your pint, boys, and thank your shamrocks  That as menfolk, we don't have to bleed from our c***  And that we can escape from the lady in red  And get out of the house and go down to the old pub instead 
[00:24:00]  Down to the old pub instead  Thank you, my lads  Thank you so much  Raise your glass  Funny, good  You did your part well  Thank you  Nice fluting  Nice fluting and nice bleeping  I was a fluter and bleeper  Nothing you've imagined 
[00:24:30]  Has prepared you for this  I don't want them enjoying it like exactly  Sometimes you want to hear  The Opie and Anthony Show  Sully and the gang got smack  I stand alone  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show  Boy  Talking about those educational films we all saw growing up  Sex, drugs, safety, venereal disease 
[00:25:00]  All kinds of fun stuff  And you know what it reminds me of, too  Remember, we were talking about this  I can't even remember  I think right when we came to New York  And Opie brought up the fact that  When he watched one of these films  As he was a kid  What did he do?  He ran home and climbed up a tree  And wouldn't come down  The apple tree in the front yard  Yeah, yeah  You were so embarrassed by the content of the six films  Well, you know, it was the famous scene 
[00:25:30]  In I guess sixth grade  Grammar school is about when it goes down  And they separated the boys and the girls  You knew something was up  Yep  You're not stupid  You know something is going to  Someone is going to eventually explain  What the F is going on, you know  Maybe there's hair growing on your body  Where there was no hair before  You're getting urges  Exactly  So they're talking about how your thing is going to be functioning differently  And you're going to be growing stuff  These are from hormones that are being pumped from certain glands 
[00:26:00]  In the male, the testes pump out testosterone  In the female, it's the ovaries pumping out their hormones  So, you know, I'm digging the film  I'm like, alright, I can handle this  You know, they're trying  They're explaining why you get acne  And how you're going to have to start shaving  Right  And all this stuff  And then, um  Hygiene, very important at this time  Matter of fact, you know what it was?  It was Washington Drive School in Centerport  And, uh, they, uh, they put us in the gym 
[00:26:30]  Big folding door  Oh, yeah  To split the gym in half  Girls on one side, boys on the other  When you hear that motor fire up to close that big door  Like lockdown  And, uh, at the end of the film  They turn the gym lights back on  Or whatever  And, uh, the teacher, uh, pretty much, uh, tells the entire gym  That, uh, your parents have been, uh, informed  That you may have questions about the film you just saw 
[00:27:00]  Oh, no  So now I'm thinking  I'm not going home and having my dad talk about sex with me  Yeah  I just don't want to deal with that yet  Very scary  So I ran home from Washington Drive School  And proceeded to climb the apple tree, Anthony  And I would not come down for dinner  You wouldn't come down for dinner because you're afraid  And dad, my dad comes out to try to talk to me  From the base of the apple tree  And I'm way up high  And I'm like, dad, I am not coming down  So you can talk about mom's boobs 
[00:27:30]  You are afraid?  No  To talk about sex with your parents  Well, that's fine  I'd rather, uh, learn it from the streets  Right  Where, where it's supposed to be learned  Yes  Now, I remember years ago, man  Uh, Pee Wee Herman played a clip  Of one of those, uh, films  On, um, that HBO special he did  Which was pretty much the prototype show  For Pee Wee's Playhouse  And it showed the kid with hygiene  Brushing his hair in the bathroom  And being polite in the cafeteria  I've always, uh, thought these things were great 
[00:28:00]  Right  Well, we got a bunch of health teachers checking in  Uh, Kathleen, what's going on?  Hi, how are you guys?  I'm a really big fan  Oh, thanks, Kathleen  And the health teacher  Yeah, well, I had a kid the other day  Just freak out totally  On the whole subject of, um, menstruation  And getting the period  And he was like  You mean this?  He could not handle it  He had like 40 questions  And one was just louder 
[00:28:30]  And more panic-stricken than the next  Well, blood, very scary  Very scary  And the film we watched, uh, they said that, uh, you ladies will only, uh, see, I don't know what they're gonna dump out  What, what?  Uh, you're only gonna, uh, flow a little bit  Yeah, just a little bit  Just a little bit  I'm like, oh, yeah?  Well, they described it  Well, this kid  This kid, like, got up out of his chair  And he pointed in this girl's face  And he says, you mean she could be bleeding from that area right now? 
[00:29:00]  And the whole class fell apart  And it was just unbelievable  I was like, listen, you have to come and see me or one of the other health teachers after class  Because we'll get your questions answered  But just calm down  Right after you show that film, you should have a seminar on, uh, hummers for all the young ladies  Right, how they could maybe please their man during this hard time  Right  Well, this is only junior high school 
[00:29:30]  Maybe when they get to high school, they could learn that  We're gonna get through this  We're gonna keep your chin up  Keep your chin up  We're gonna turn this thing around  We're gonna turn this thing around  All right, Kathleen, thank you  You're welcome  Have a good day  All right  I like how the mother was describing it to the daughter when she said  Your womb makes a warm, comfortable place for a baby to grow  And if this isn't used, it has to be removed from the body or it leaves the body  Yeah  This is your period 
[00:30:00]  Yeah  Oh, that's scary  They try to make it sound like it's, uh, not  It's okay  It's a warm, comfortable place  It sounds like she's gonna be expelling a den  Right  You know  Please  Let's go to Maggie Mae  Hello  Wake up, Maggie Mae  I'm up  Hi, guys  Can you hear me?  Hi, guys  Yes, we can hear you  I wore the porch swing  I want you to know  I used to wear the porch swing  You did?  What they didn't tell the 11-year-old little girl is that she should cut down her pubes because it used to pinch us 
[00:30:30]  It was, in fact, like a paper clip and your pubic hairs would get caught inside of it and you'd be sitting in class and it's pinching and pulling and you're sitting there in a class and it was horrible.  It was horrible. It was just horrible.  I think you're absolutely right because back then  Back then, they didn't really, they were into the 70s Earth Mama Muffs  The big 70s  It was an elastic band  Yeah 
[00:31:00]  With two giant paper clips, but the paper clips had teeth and would bite you  Ah, they had teeth!  I thought only the hot dog bit  Yeah, the hot dog  All right, Maggie Mae, thank you  Wow, imagine that a girl just sits down and goes, ow!  And you knew  You knew  People picking up on the porch swing reference  I like that  It looked like a porch swing  James, what's going on?  Hey, ONA, what's going on, man?  Hey, bro  Yeah, we were in the door-to-door, Jim, we were like 6th or 7th grade and we found a box of this stuff  Yeah  We didn't know what it was, we were looking at it, looking at it 
[00:31:30]  So, one of the guys was pretty smart, he puts it on his head, we took the adhesive and we glued a bunch of the pads on it, like a mohawk  So, each of us followed, there was like 5 of us running around the gym with this raxi pad mohawk on  That looked cool, yeah, I looked cool  See, but even those  I went to Catholic school, so it was worse, but none comes in, she's like, get those off your head!  That's funny  Even those were the newer ones with the adhesive  Can I say something else?  Yeah  It made me get the syphilis, and a man in my position cannot afford to be made to get the syphilis! 
[00:32:00]  Syphilis!  Very good  Now we're out  You look ridiculous  And the Pee Wee Herman film was, people are writing in, Mr. Bungle  Oh, okay  Don't be a Mr. Bungle  They had a kid sitting down, and he didn't let the girls sit down first, you know, no manners  He was talking with his mouth full, bad posture  He was a Mr. Bungle  Guess that's where the band got the name  Nice  Susan, what's going on? 
[00:32:30]  Hey, I was calling to let you know that the newer film  Hello, Susan  Huh?  Can you hear me?  Yeah, go ahead, Susan  The newest film out, I'm a special ed teacher, for the girls getting their period, is worse than the one years ago  I was laughing so hard in the back of the room, I could hardly show it  They actually  Hold on, hold on  You know, hold on, because I don't know what they're going to dump out of  So let's just get rid of that word for now, and just say the ladies' time, or whatever, okay?  Alright, so you got the latest film?  What they did, the latest film, they do a sleepover, and the girl, you know, has it happen 
[00:33:00]  The next morning, the mom's explaining it to her  Yeah  And she shows her in pancake batter  She takes the pancake batter and goes, and these are your, and shows the whole diagram in pancake batter  These are your, what, like ovaries?  Yeah  And these are the fallopian tubes that makes this whole pancake batter thing  Wait, was she putting it on a griddle?  Yeah  That she just, oh, she pours like the pancake crap on the counter and makes a diagram?  I like mine with syrup  Like she was cooking  It was because I was seven months pregnant when I had to give this class, so the kids are asking questions, had met my husband 
[00:33:30]  Oh, wow  And they started asking real specific questions  Yeah, like how big is it and stuff, right?  Yeah, it got a little too weird for me, I was like, alright, name's out of here  That's classic  Yeah, but the new film is even scarier than the old one  Well, send all your films into the O.P. and Anthony show  I want to see some of the new ones  We have been talking about this subject for many years on our show, and now it's, you know, it's time to play a lot more these days  Right  We've played some in the past, but I'm hearing there's one that the Navy has been showing how to stay away from the homos 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, yeah, you don't want to be a homo in the Navy  My husband's Air Force, and the ones in the Air Force are even scarier  There's an anti-homo Navy one from, I guess, the 60s  Cool  Alright, Susan, thank you  You guys are great from D.C.  We're trying, we're going to be down there a week from Friday  Alright, we're here  Alright, and a week from Thursday in Philly, we're doing a little road trip  I also got some that I got to bring in concerning atomic safety 
[00:34:30]  Which are really funny  Duck and cover, good boy, Jimmy  Yeah, good boy  He's riding his bike, this is hysterical  He's riding his bike on the side of the road  And all of a sudden, this huge flash  And Billy, like, jumps off his bike  Jimmy jumps off his bike  And they get right in where the curb meets the road  Yeah  In the gutter, and they duck and cover up their heads  Good boy  And that's supposed to protect them  That's going to save their asses  That's going to save them 
[00:35:00]  From a nuclear fallout  That's good  Seth, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show  What's up?  How are you doing today?  Alright, man  Great show, great show  I'm listening for a few years now  Love it  Thank you  I lived in elementary school  Sunrise Drive Elementary School  And the Long Island Railroad came to our school  I know this is not, like, the health videos or whatnot  But they wanted to scare us  From not playing on the third rail  Or not playing on the tracks  When the trains would come  Yeah  I don't know if you ever saw that  You guys grew up on Long Island 
[00:35:30]  Of course  And they did one scene where  All of us are, like, in sixth grade  Fifth grade, sixth grade  We're all sitting there  This guy gets up and he goes  My name is Gino Montana  And I'm from the Long Island Railroad  And this is what happens when you play  On the tracks  On super, whatever  Unsupervised  And they showed a picture of a kid  Standing in front of one of those  Old Long Island Railroad trains  Yeah  And all these kids are screaming and crying  No, no, no  Don't let it happen  Next thing you know  They show another slide of guts 
[00:36:00]  And, like, it's like cow guts  But we are  In other words, sixth grade  Oh, right  They're trying to scare you, yeah  Crying and screaming and whatnot  And, well, now I can't go on trains anymore  So, hey, what the hell  Alright, thank you, Seth  Well, here's, speaking of train safety there  Samantha from Philly  Has a cute little story  This sounds like a great Twilight Zone episode  But it was a train safety movie  One kid  They show one kid  Throwing a rock at a passing train  One walking the tracks  Gets her foot caught in the rails  One gets his kite stuck in the electrical lines 
[00:36:30]  By the tracks  And climbs up to get it  And was on his bike  And tried to beat the train  Of course, they're all killed  Then they're forced  For the rest of eternity  To sit on this train  And ride this, like, hell train  Together  There's one kid  That was with the kid  With the kite  And he didn't die  But he's forced to go on the train  To see what happens  To kids that do stupid things  On the train  And then, at the end  They, the kids on the train  On the hell train  Yell at this kid  To get off the train  And warn the other children  What it's like  If you do something 
[00:37:00]  Concerning a train  And die  So they tell him  To get off the hell train  And he goes and runs  And tells his friends  How awful it is  If you die  In one of these train things  But that's, that's like horrific  That's some of the little hell children  For eternity  Riding the train  Man  Scary  I love them  Oh wait, Mike saw  The, uh, the atomic safety film  Go ahead, Mike  Hey guys, I saw the atomic safety film  Yeah  They tell you to run away  From the flash  When you see one  Yeah  Yeah, you could outrun a flash 
[00:37:30]  From a nuclear blast  Run away from the flash  Nice  Good boy, Jimmy  Good boy  All right, guys  I'm going to listen to Anthony  Call me a tool on the radio  Eh, we might not, though  No, see  Now you're going to be  Waiting and waiting  Because I won't say it  Oh, okay  Let's go to D.C.  Eileen, what's up?  Hey, yeah  I just wanted to say  I saw the Kotex Classic  Saturday Night Live  Skip 2  It was just like my junior high  Those things used to  Flip out of the belt  And you'd see girls  Walk around  Those things  Stick up out of their pants  Oh  I feel bad 
[00:38:00]  How embarrassing  At least they figured that out, huh?  Yeah, you'd think so  But man  They would ride up  And you'd see these girls  With like tails  Like deer  I would say the tampon  Probably  Like deer  Like a white-tailed deer  The tampon  Probably one of the greatest inventions  Of the 20th century  Would you say?  Yeah, definitely  I would  Yeah  Especially that OB  With no applicator OB  Designed by a woman gynecologist  The comments we were coming up with, man  Because this film was from 1953, I believe  Yeah  So I go to 
[00:38:30]  And it was a whole educational film  On menstruation  And I go to Ann  You know what all these ladies  Have in common today?  Uh-huh  They don't have to worry about menstruation anymore  Wah-wah  Because, yeah, they're all old women now  We were just idiots  And the old school teachers talking about this  In some of the films  Eileen, I've got to cut you off  Because Rick has found  Four more clips from  The educational films we were watching today  Which ones are these from, Rick?  Is it the drug one?  Wait, explain  Because we get a whole new audience every 15 minutes  This was a little film about drugs 
[00:39:00]  And how you shouldn't get involved with the drug scene  And it was made  It looks to be in the, I guess, 50s  That was 58  58  The blonde-haired guy from Emergency  Remember him?  He was a kid  He played the kid in this  Let me see, Rick  Number three  Number three  Pit of despair  Yeah  Narcotics  Pit of despair  Pit of despair  So he goes to one of these groovy parties  To get high  And far out  Not be a square 
[00:39:30]  Because that's the last thing you want to be  And he goes to this party  And he's coaxed, Opie  Into partying and drinking  And he meets this girl at the party  But he doesn't know the girl's in cahoots  With the drug dealer guy  And she's a heroin addict  Right  And she gets him on the booze  And they're kissing  And then she invites him to go to  Where it all happens  The garage  The garage, Opie  To where they are all  Huddled around in the garage  Smoking reefer  And doing  Benny's  Dexys  And other drugs 
[00:40:00]  Reds  Reds  Goofballs  Barbiturates  I'd want to do goofballs  That sounds fun  Know how many people emailed  Roy DeSoto's his name  Know how many people emailed us  Saying what the F is a barbiturate  Barbs, man  That's well  Now they go by brand names  Barbiturates are nothing but  You know, downs  Lewds  Quite lewd  Vicodins  Things like that now  Would be your  Your barbs  And amphetamines  Are your ups  Your uppers  All right, relax  Uppers, downers 
[00:40:30]  Benny's  Dixie  Meth  So here's a clip from that film  To John  It seems perfectly natural  And innocent  To bump into an old classmate  He hasn't seen Pete  Since he dropped out of school  Last year  From the looks of him  He seems to be doing well  On his out of town  Selling job  Ah, out of town  Selling job  The guy looked like Tom Hanks  From Castaway  When he had the beard  With the beard  He looked like Tom Hanks  But he had this big beard  And he's kind of, you know 
[00:41:00]  Scary looking  He's just an old friend  That he bumped into  And he'd have been  He'd been out of town  Out of town  Selling job  Yeah, he's doing well  For himself  The music's classic  What John doesn't know is  The selling job  Is pushing dope  And the long absence  From town  Was spent in the state prison  Their accidental meeting  Calls for a little celebration  Yes  And Pete has just the thing  There's a little private party  Going on tonight  Plenty of fun  And laughs  Take a break from the books  And live a little 
[00:41:30]  It sounds good  But today's his father's day off  And John needs his help  With some school problems  If there's another party sometime  Maybe he can make it then  But Pete isn't interested  In sometime  Maybe  Or squares  If you want to swing  Call him  Right now  He's got to split  He's got to find fish  Ready to be hooked  Victims  To supply him with money  For the heroin  He needs today  And tomorrow  And tomorrow  He goes and speeds off 
[00:42:00]  In his roadster  Sure  He doesn't have time  For squares  Fish to get hooked  It's like  You know  As a kid  Growing up  And seeing some movies  That were very similar  To this one  Yeah  I thought  It was going to be  Impossible  To avoid drugs  I really thought  Like it happened like this  Like they roped you in  I never thought  It was like it really is  You're walking in school  Maybe someone you know  Or your friend 
[00:42:30]  Or something goes  Dude you smoke a joint  I think nah  Or okay  Whatever it is  It wasn't this big plan  You had more of a choice  When it came down to it  Yeah it wasn't like  I have to hook this fish  Like this poor guy  Is setting this up  Like he's setting up  A crime worth billions of dollars  Like they're going to  Tie him down  And force feed him  Like they're kidnapping  An executive son  Or something  You know  Just ask him  Does he want dope  Right  The guy could have  Sold it to him right there  He does it  You sell it to him  He doesn't  You go ah  Alright  Well come to the party  And we got some audio  From the party  Oh the groovy bash 
[00:43:00]  Yeah  John the party is swinging  Just the thing he needs  To pep him up  The stage is set  The principal players  Are in position  The curtain is out  John doesn't realize it  But he has just been cast  As the star fall guy  In a real life tragedy  That's great  That is classic  So the whole scene  Is there's the chick  The drug dealer  And some dude 
[00:43:30]  Right  Dude  This party  Is set up  For the benefit  Because all I could see  Was he was the only  Square  And new fish  That was at the party  All the rest of them  Are doing the drugs  And everything else  So this whole party  Was choreographed  Just to get him  Hooked  On dope  Yeah that's how it happened  Exactly  That's exactly how it happened  More from the party  Alright  Yeah  The exertion of the dance  The excitement of Helen 
[00:44:00]  And several beers  Have taken effect  Inhibition and caution  Are forgotten  When Helen suggests  They have a few more beers  He's all for it  Why not  Everyone else is doing it  To refuse would be  Square  And that must be  Avoided at all costs  Besides  He's never been  High on it before  And he never will  He can handle the stuff  Sure  Of course  He can handle the stuff  He's never been  High  One more question  Which one is this?  This is where they go 
[00:44:30]  To the garage  Oh Squaresville  Squaresville  Alright  They go to the garage  The next step  Is the garage  Yeah  There some of the gang  Are really blasting  That's where the real action is  Yeah  Come on and take a look  Oh take a trip  From Squaresville  Live a little  And see what it's like  For yourself  The senses are dulled  Just enough  To be reckless  Helen  The music  The beer  The promise of excitement  Press in on him  An oral thing  Now curiosity  Has to be satisfying  And why not 
[00:45:00]  It can't do any harm  To look  Of course it can't  But you know  It does  Because he turns on  Doesn't he  He turns on  He gets hooked  He gets groovy  And high  He's no longer a square  No  He's with it  The music is classic  Isn't it  Soon he'll be  Dropping out of college  Right  And teaming up  With another guy  To do a radio show  Hey Rick

[00:55:00]  We blew this off last summer  But it's back this year  Bigger than ever  Riverfront State  Tomorrow at 5  Through Ticketmaster  Yes  Alright  Also there was a  Cute little article  In the newspaper today  Anthony  This  Hey Mike  What's up  Hey what's up  Hey go ahead real fast  Hey listen  I have a question  Are you guys going off the air  Are we personally  Yeah like  Are you going country  Or  I was typing up  On my computer  I heard that you were going country 
[00:55:30]  So I was just concerned  Well  Yeah  And I will discuss it right now  Okay  We'll give you all the details  But  All the details  I hope it doesn't go country  Because you guys  Like  You have 107.1  Don't listen to country in Jersey  Yeah  Alright thank you Mike  Alright true  We have to start from the beginning  Not to  You know  This will take like two minutes  Tops  The ratings came out for New York  Because every time we talk about  The station we're on in New York  Everyone gets confused  And goes  What do you mean  What's going on with the station in Cleveland  What's going on with BCA  No  It's a great station  No 
[00:56:00]  See if you're listening to us  In Cleveland  And Philly  And DC  And Boston  And Buffalo  I know I'm missing a few  We're on some great  Great stations  Great stations  That are completely fine  And will not be changing  Not at all  We're talking about  Our flagship station  Here in New York  Flagship  Do you have to say ship  The hellhole  We call WNEW  Here in New York  The flagship with a T  Might be better  Yeah the ratings came out 
[00:56:30]  What about a week and a half ago  Yeah  And once again  They were horrendous  Horrendous  Awful  We have stations in New York  We're talking about New York  I'm going to keep saying it  New York  That don't even speak English  That beat this place  Yeah  We have stations that  You can't even hear in Manhattan  Yeah  That are beating this radio station  It's horrendous  So it's very obvious to the bigwigs  That something has to be done  Some changes must be made  There will be changes 
[00:57:00]  I said it a week and a half ago  Oh there absolutely will be  People think I'm BSing  Absolutely will be  What are those changes?  We don't know  We don't know for sure  But there are ideas that are floating around  That are good possibilities  See the problem with the company is that  They still like the Opie and Anthony show  We're doing well for the company  Right  So I mean if we suck too  It would be just easy just to clear everyone out  And move a whole new crew in  New format, new music 
[00:57:30]  Maybe play some of that Celine Dion light AC stuff  Sure  It's been rumored  But  But you can't have a light AC station  With Opie and Anthony doing this type of crap  In the middle of the afternoon  Defeats the purpose  Exactly  We don't mix with the music  The music doesn't mix with us  And then you have to  You know we come on at 3  And now again  We would have to find  An entire new audience  That would be tuning in at 3  So what the company has to do  For the station here in New York  I've got to keep saying it  The flagship station  Of the Opie and Anthony show  Is find something that is compatible 
[00:58:00]  With what you and I do  Or  Maybe it's other talk shows  Maybe it's some kind of rock format  But something  Or  Or just get us off this station  Right  Get us off this station  Put us somewhere else here in New York  Right  On another one of the  Find Infinity stations here  That wouldn't affect your listening  If you're listening outside of  Right  New York City  And then take this station  And just completely change it  Exactly  Well  David Hinckley  Who never gets anything right 
[00:58:30]  By the way  David Hinckley is such a tool  He writes for the Daily News  Yeah  And he is such a complete tool  He never gets anything right  The guy  Well everything we read  Is like  More speculation  More crap  And another one of these radio guys  That blows off all the  Important radio stories  In the city  Yeah  And talks about stuff like  That no one else cares about  Stations you've never heard of  Transmitter locations  Transmitter 
[00:59:00]  Who cares  Who cares  There are some serious radio battles  Going on in New York  He has no clue  Good inside stuff  He'd rather talk about  Some weird station  In the middle of nowhere  Moving their transmitter  From one hill to another  Public radio  Because that'll add  At least a thousand new listeners  To this signal  He mentions call letters  Of stations  I've never heard of  In my life  Right  Like some kind of a public  You know  Funded station  Yeah  Yeesh  Anyway  So I guess  New York City  Is losing their 
[00:59:30]  Country station  Yeah  The country station  Here in New York  Is going away  Yeah that one is  Changing to what  What are they going to  I don't know  Spanish or something  I don't even know  What they're going to  Probably  Yeah  Lord knows we need  Another one of those  God  And so now  The country fans  Here in New York  Did you know  There were country fans  In New York  All ten of them  They're all freaked out  You know  How many god damn  Country fans  Could there be  In New York  City  I'm not talking  About New York State 
[01:00:00]  We're talking about  New York City  The diameter  Of a radio's  Range  That's it  New York City  How many country fans  You misplaced  Oklahomans  Over here  How many  Probably more than  We have for this station  Well that's obvious  So it reads  In the paper here  Because all the  Country fans  All up in arms  The big debate  Among country fans  Now has shifted  To what station  If any  Will pick up 
[01:00:30]  The country format  Anthony  What station  At the top  Of everyone's  Wish list  Is  You guessed it  WNEW  The flagship station  Of the Opie and Anthony  Show  Wee  The radio station  Here in New York City  Yahoo  Which except for  Opie and Anthony  Has lousy ratings  As a hot talk station  Let me correct  David Hinckley  Ron and Fez  Are doing  Great after us  Right  They're doing great  How's that all about 
[01:01:00]  Again wrong  Poor Ron and Fez  Ignored again  In the paper  Well they're lumped  Into  The failure  That is this station  You know  We kind of escape it  Because we've  Always done well  Here at  NEW  Here in New York  But I don't know  They've been switched  Around  In what part  Of the day  That they're actually  Broadcasting from  So many times  That they just  Kind of fall into it  They've done like  Three or four  Different ships  Here in New York  Everything but  Mornings  Yeah  Right now  They're on  After us 
[01:01:30]  Yeah  Next month  They might be on  Before us  Or in the mornings  We don't know  They have been on  Before us  And they've been on  Late at night  Late at night  Never know where  They're going to end up  So Hinkley  You're wrong  Ron and Fez  Are doing well  And then he writes  That would be a lot  Oh okay  The rotisserie radio  Scenario is to move  Those two guys  Opie and Anthony  To K-Rock  Ah there you go  And give  WNEW  A new format  Uh huh  That's interesting 
[01:02:00]  Yeah that'll happen  Make  They'd have to line  The hallways over there  With asbestos  To keep the flames  That are shooting  Out of people's heads  From igniting the building  Wouldn't that mean  That the Abercrombie  And Fitch Midget  Would technically  Be our boss  Yeah that would happen  Steve Kingston  Over there  Would then  Technically  Realistically  Like would you  He would walk in  Let's let's  Here's the scenario  Yeah  He walks in 
[01:02:30]  Wants to have a meeting  With us about show content  What do you say  I say  After the complete  Laughter  That would come out  Of my face  I would just say  No it's not happening  Take it up with  And then insert  Whatever company  Executive that's  Much above him  In that space  Whoever's doing that position  This week  This week yeah  And here it's  The new guy  That used to run  Orville Redenbacher  Popcorn  Is next in line  Ain't gonna happen  And he's been so pompous 
[01:03:00]  Behind the scenes  He's saying  I think I can get those guys  To play some songs  Oh my god  See so he's already  Starting without even  Just being an official thing  Right  I think I can get them  To play a couple records  I think that'll happen  I think I can make them  Change their names  To Kane and Cabby  No  If it wasn't our choice  To start talking  For the whole  The whole show  But you know what  It's working  So we're gonna continue  Doing this for now  I can see it  Look guys  Alright  You're over here now 
[01:03:30]  We've decided  That we're just gonna  Play a few songs  That's just  Just gonna play a few songs  You know  In and out of break maybe  You could go to a song  No  No  If we play songs  It's cause we enjoy a song  And wanna play it  That's why we play songs  Maybe an artist has died  And we wanna do a little tribute  There we'll play some song  A song  Does it  Is it relevant to something  We're talking about  There  Then we'll play it  Because 
[01:04:00]  Fidget wants us to  No  No  No  You had your chance  To have us  You passed  Right  Bye bye  So that's  One of the options  Well you know  That are being  If they wanna do that  You know  Ken Stevens better  Be our boss still  Cause the other guy over there  I ain't listening to either  No  No  Tom would not be listened to  No  Tom the douche  No  If Ken Stevens  Would have to oversee this program 
[01:04:30]  Regardless of where  Then the other rumor is  It's so  Volatile  Yeah  That if they do move us  To the K-Rock they're in  Oh I've heard this  Yeah  That we wouldn't even broadcast  From the building  No we would still  See cause of technology  We don't have to be  In that building  To broadcast from there  We can broadcast  From right here  Right here  But just be heard  On another station  But they would just  Pipe it in over there  And that's where  We would come out of  Because we'd have to have  That would be  A few city blocks  Between us  And that building  That would be 
[01:05:00]  Hell too  Because  Now we're still  In this building  With like  Country jocks  All around  Right  Then we would look over  And the country feel  We'd look over  Through this very window  Here into another studio  Where the country guy  Would be broadcasting  His brand of music  And doing maybe  Howdy howdy everybody  It's New York's country  N-E-W  We'll make you  We'll cry and cry 
[01:05:30]  Boy this is a good  Old good one  Ain't it  I love this music  New York's new country  W-N-E-W  Oh wait  He's already dead  Phew  So  Georgie in heart  So it continues  In the paper today  The rotisserie radio  Scenarios to move  Those two 
[01:06:00]  To K-Rock  And give N-E-W  A new format  That would be  A lot more complicated  Than it sounds  Oh  Because of contracts  And other internal factors  Other internal factors  God Dave  You should have  Called us  We'll tell you  What the internal factors  Are all about  Uh huh  One being  That we can't  Work for Tom  Or the Abercrombie  And Fitch midget  Ever  Even if N-E-W  Management  Decided to switch  There's no guarantee  Country would be  The winner  But there are 
[01:06:30]  Reports from inside  N-E-W  That what if  Discussions have been  Held  That's the truth  Which may reflect  Only the fact  That radio  Like other businesses  Throws out many scenarios  And acts on few of them  So that's the latest thing  And  Yeehaw  It may be a country statement  Boy  They've just tried  Everything  The country  What would it be  Because you gotta have  Your little slug line  What would that be  For a  Country N-E-W 
[01:07:00]  They would keep  The call letters  Right  The legendary  Famous  N-E-W  Right  Earl what's the matter  What if it goes country  You know what you do  Ant  You dust off those  God damn  Leonard Skinner records  And give it another round  But that ain't country  Well it's better than country  Earl  Now here's a problem  Earl Douglas  Black Earl  Has been here  Forever  Through many incarnations  Of N-E-W  As a rock station  But  It's been modern rock 
[01:07:30]  It's been  Classic rock  You know  It's been different  Types of rock  Now  Country  What would Earl do  If they're a bunch of  Good old good boys  Good old boys  Walking the hallways  And you know  You know what they call you  Right  Starts with a knee  Ends with a grr  That's with those people  Earl  That's how they think  Come on  We've all seen them  The big old cowboy hats  And boots  I thought you were going to say

[01:10:30]  They're traditionally and stereotypically known to be  You know  Not as sensitive to the races  You know what I mean?  To the darker races  Maybe they could do that  Oh well  Yee-hoo  What the hell is this?

[01:14:00]  End of messages  Calk  Calk  Opie  Calking  Calking out of one's butt crack  Anthony  Is a sign of personal confidence  The O-O-O-O-Opie and Anthony Show  This show will really  Give you brain damage  And we're back  With the Opie and Anthony Show  Just a reminder  Don't forget tomorrow  Whip them out Wednesday  Yes  The wow season is upon us 
[01:14:30]  It's now called  Whip them out whenever  But it started with  This whole Wednesday thing  Yeah  To participate  You need to get a wow  On your car  So if you don't have  The wow bumper sticker yet  Make a homemade wow sign  For tomorrow's festivities  Okay  Exactly  A lot of the cities  We're on in  And the station  Doesn't have the  Special wow sticker  No but you just  Make whatever  Draw it on a piece of cardboard  Write it  Whatever  Don't matter  We love homemade wow signs  You just gotta put the wow  Somewhere on your vehicle 
[01:15:00]  And real fast  If you need a wow sticker  Here in the New York area  Just send a self-addressed  Stamped envelope  And we'll send out  Some wow stickers  The address  888  7th Avenue  Yeah  New York  New York  10106  Roy  And that address is up on  opiananthony.com  Rick is back in the studio  We got more clips  Anthony  From the educational films  We were checking out  Once again today  Yeah  Something we have touched on  Many times  In the last few years  We love it  I was a student of these 
[01:15:30]  As a child  I loved  I loved them  Couldn't get enough of them  And  Have some more of my collection  I'll be bringing in  Very good  The Navy  Homo Navy film  Plenty of fun stuff  Do you have that one?  Yeah  Gotta find it at home though  I do have it though  Samantha  Hi there  What's up?  Oh you're the phone sex operator  I am  Oh look at that  What do you want to do for us today?  Well first of all  My site and another site  Would like to offer to you  Five free calls to give away 
[01:16:00]  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  We never plug websites  Unless we get something out of it  Right  Well you would get  Five free  Phone sex calls  To give away  Is that not good enough?  Samantha  These things are never free  On these websites  You know there's a rumor  That our morning guy here  In New York  Is giving away  Dates with escorts  On this show  Is he?  That's pretty cool  Wow he's trying  But I think there's 
[01:16:30]  A little problem with that  So they're trying to  Work out the details  Damn that's good  Because I think  An escort service  That wants to buy  Advertising  Why not?  Take whatever we can get  Remember the time  We had the ads  For the escorts  Yeah  They actually  It lasted one day  Escort companies  Advertising on our show  But upper management  Had no clue  No  They didn't  Call these girls now  Right  It was hot  Samantha  All the girls 
[01:17:00]  All the girls on the site  Have 800 numbers  So no one will be charged  For these free calls  You know something  Samantha  We know that  The 800 numbers  Are an 800 number  We're not stupid  We're not stupid  We know how this stuff works  It's very nice  If you have a great voice  And your phone  Sex operator  That's fine  But as far as  These websites go  Do you honestly  Want me to believe  That people  Go to a website  They look up  An 800 number  They call it up 
[01:17:30]  And for absolutely  No money  A girl talks  About sex with them  No no no  That's not how  Our site works  You get the first  Three minutes for free  No no no  And that's where  They BS you today  Call me now  And get you just  Turned on enough  Where you gotta  Keep going  After three minutes  No that's not how  It works  If a gentleman  Calls in  We go on  To our billing system  And charge the guy  With his credit card  Oh  I ain't calling you  Lady  So  So  If we give away 
[01:18:00]  These  These free calls  To your listeners  Uh huh  Uh huh  They call in  And get  Ten minutes for free  On the 800 number  Uh huh  And the reason  Why we're set up  With 800 numbers  Is because  We're not one  Of those sites  That has a picture  Of a girl  And you know  Ten people  Are talking  For the girl  You get who  You call  Of course you do  Samantha I think  We're gonna have  To pass  Yeah  And it said  On the line  I can do  A great fake  Go for you guys 
[01:18:30]  For the 5 o'clock  Fake go  That's why  We took the call  I can do that  And I also  Wanted to do  Um  A free call  On air  With Norton  Today  But he's not  No he's not here  He died tragically  Um Samantha  Yes  You got her  You got her  We got an amateur  On the line  Tina  She'll take care  Of us at 5  All of those  God damn things  Tina  Hi how are you  You're not selling  Anything right  No nothing  Just a fan  Of the opening  Anthony show  Well actually  My boyfriend is

[01:19:30]  I'll try  I may not be  Competition to  You know  A professional  But  No we got rid  Of the professional  We like the  Amateur girls  Uh oh  Hold on Tina  We'll get to you  Okay  You know  Now that we  We kind of touched  On the subject  Of the 800 numbers  And you know  The phone sex things  It's a scam  When they tell you  That you're gonna get  Free things  They'll leave you  On hold for that  Whatever that's all about  But it reminds me  Of something I've been  So pissed off at  Over the past month  Or so  I don't know 
[01:20:00]  What's happening  I'm pretty savvy  With computers  Right  I'm on it all the time  Yes Mr. Everquest  Gameplay  Exactly  I  A lot of video games  I enjoy  I'm on the internet  A lot  I get  99% of my news  I get from internet sites  And  Whatever  I'm just constantly  Checking out  Things on the internet  Pop-up ads  Alright  Pop-up ads  At home  Something is  Taking over  My god damn computer  And I've done a lot  To try to flush this out  The same pop-up ads 
[01:20:30]  Are popping up  No matter what sites  I go to  So it has nothing  To do with  I could go to  Disney  Dot com  And porno  Friggin sites  Pop-ups will come up  I go to  Anyw.com  For the station  Here in New York  And the same  Pop-ups come up  It's the same  God damn pop-ups  So the pop-up ads  Are following you  They're not coming  From the websites  I'm going to  Something's on my  God effing computer  That is  Popping these up  I cleaned all my  Cookies out 
[01:21:00]  I cleaned the history  I did everything  You might have to  Kill the pop-up ads  I have to kill them  Put them on the floor  And jump up and down  On them  I've installed  A pop-up stopper  Oh Steve's going to  Tell you what it is  Alright Steve  Mr. Computer  I had the exact  Same problem Anthony  I will install something  Or I'll tell you  Where to go  To install something  What is it  It's a program  That scans your computer  For all the hidden  Crap that you don't  Know that's on it  Every time you go  To a website  Nine times out of ten  There's something  That'll drop  A little temporary  File that tracks 
[01:21:30]  A cookie  Sometimes it's a cookie  Sometimes it's someplace  Because I cleaned out  My cookies Steve  I know  And they're not  Where you think they are  No  There's cookies everywhere  Yeah  There's cookies everywhere  Those effing cookies  They're talking to you  I looked at the cookie  And it had a face  Right  And said  Don't eat me  I tried to bite it  And it screamed  I have a wife  And seven kids at home  Don't eat me  Don't eat me  The toolbar  Looked like it's hair  Can we play that 
[01:22:00]  Into breaking  I know  I love that one  I think we have  A whole new audience  So again  What I did  I installed a stop  Pop-up program  Which I then  In order to open  A second browser  Have to hit the control key  Yeah  So and then  If I click on a link  Like let's say  I go to  Foundrymusic.com  Oh  I click on videos  And then the menu  Comes up to which videos  I want to click  I click on the  Video choice  And a new window  Will open  Right  With the stop the pop-up thing  That won't open  Unless I'm holding  The control key down  When I click on it 
[01:22:30]  I've lived through this  I'll deal with it  But it's  It's less inconvenient  Than the god-given pop-ups  This  What this will do  Is this is a program  That scans everything  On your computer  I have used it on  Some of the  Sort of common ground  Computers that we have  In this place  The ones that everybody  In the station uses  Oh god  Those must be full of film  Exactly  And after one week  I ran it once  My computer has VD  Yeah  Yeah  I have syphilis  It's little Bambino died  I don't know  Who uses my computer  After me  But man  I think I got VD 
[01:23:00]  Just touching the keypad  Look at the keypad  My keyboard has shankers  Yeah  It's got big shankers on it  Spirochetes dripping from them  It is unbelievable  Awful  My computer's being used for  Off hours  I'm rubbing salve on it  Yeah  It's amazing what you find  I ran it on the one  Out there by the printer  And found 160 cookies  In maybe four minutes  That it took to run the program  And these are  These are not in your cookie folder  No  They're everywhere  It puts them everywhere  Because it knows  These programmers  That develop these things 
[01:23:30]  Know that you're going to go  And empty out your cookie folder  If you empty out your cookie folder  Then  For people that aren't familiar  There are small  Tiny  Itty bitty  Little  Programs  On your computer  That  Kind of  Direct you to websites  They do a bunch of things  Right  They keep tabs on where you're going  And they  They leave a record  Of what website  You've gone to  In that little bit of information  And now  They're not just used for that  Now  They're used to  Link you to pop-up ads  Yeah  So no matter what site  Now 
[01:24:00]  She's hot and everything  But she pops up  And I've seen her face so many times  I've grown to hate this bitch  She comes up  I go  Get out of my life  And I click off  And a little Dominic Barber  Comes up and goes  You're a gentleman  Right  You'll close that down  Like a gentleman  And then I check my account  On my bank's site  And half my balance is gone  Really  Are we still talking about  Cookies or something  Cookies  Oh okay  You're a gentleman  Clicking that  You'll minimize that window 
[01:24:30]  Very gentlemanly  Go have your  Go have a heart attack  You know it's coming  Well Steve  If you would leave me that program  I would be  Indebted to you  It pisses me off  They're worms  That are figuring out  More and more ways  To just  Screw you  You brought up a great point  In the office  About the internet  Yeah  Go figure that one out  Look at me  Opie says  Call the press  Alert the media  And I agree with this  The internet is turning  Into a vast wasteland 
[01:25:00]  Oh yeah  That is going to have  To do something  And reinvent itself  To be useful again  Someone has to step in  And organize the whole damn thing  To be useful  It was cool at first  Then when it first started  It was like  Oh my god  Like you felt like  One of those old sailors  Setting up for the new world  For the first time  No because you had  A good way of  Talking about the internet  When it first popped  It's like the wild wild west  Right  Like the wild wild west  You're going  We have all this land  And we don't know 
[01:25:30]  What the F we're going to make  With it right  Yeah  Well now  There's a lot of people  In the wild wild west  Now we've got to organize  Into like states or something  Yeah  It's got to get a little more organized  Because now it's  There are some basic sites  You can go to  And it's all fine  CNN.com  I go there  I get a lot of news from there  Drudge is fun  For your goofy news  You can get a lot of information  You've got  You've got something  You want to learn about  You go to Yahoo  You pop it in the search engine  And then you've got to  Troll through the masses  Of crap  To try to find it  It's got to get organized 
[01:26:00]  And it's got to get  Not cleaned up  Like get the sex off  But I love the sex  Organize it  Organize it  So we can get to the good stuff  Get rid of this stuff  That is alleged free  I can't stand that  Free nude celebs  Let's say  Hey someone said  You go there  There's not one free thing  It redirects you to a whole different type of porno page  If I want nude celebrities  And I click on a link that says nude celebrities  Don't send me to black ass  How did it go to black ass?  I like the black ass  But if you want black ass 
[01:26:30]  You would go to black ass  If you look for nude celebrity  You click on a link that says nude celebrity  I don't want to browse it all of a sudden and say  Black ass  No no black ass goes to teen nymphs  Which is fine if you're in the mood for that too  Sometimes you're in the mood for a smorgasbord  I don't want to go to hot sea  But you click on teen nymphs  And it goes to horny housewives  Man ass  You want man ass?

We're psyched.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:32:00]  We're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show today.  Oh, we kept Tina on hold for a while.  Oh, yeah, stay there.  I forgot about Tina.  Chris, what's up?  What's up, boys?  You tell me, man.  I just want to thank you for not bringing up the Islander game, boy,  and putting that jinx on him, Opie.  I don't want to say a thing.  Please don't.  Go Isles, man.  I'm ready.  I'm pumped, dude.  I just keep looking at the old clock.  I can't wait to get out of here and run home. 
[01:32:30]  Me too, dude.  Me too.  You guys have a good day.  Later.  All right.  It should be an action-packed game.  It's going to be an unbelievable game either way tonight.  You think ugly?  You think a lot more of brawling?  It's going to be real ugly.  Especially if one side starts feeling that it's slipping away.  A lot of the New York paper is talking about, will the team shake hands at the end of tonight's game?  No.  I'd be amazed if they shaked hands.  This has been one of the ugliest series in a long time. 
[01:33:00]  I think there's going to be a brawl at the end of this game.  Could very well be.  I think there's going to be a brawl.  Could very well be.  We'll have to wait and see.  Tina.  Hi.  We've got to move on with the show, but you were going to do the fake O for us, right?  Yes.  Boyfriend, big fan of the show, and you're helping us out today.  Uh-huh.  How old a gal are you, Tina?  Um, 18.  Oh, Tina.  Yeah.  Tina.  That's so funny because he said he would say that.  Ah, so predictable, Opie. 
[01:33:30]  Look at us.  By the way, Wheel of Fortune doing Teen Week.  Teen Week on Wheel of Fortune.  How funny is that?  You hear the commercials?  Teen Week on Wheel of Fortune.  Nice.  And we've been doing that teen concept, so it just makes it funny when you hear the commercials.  Yeah.  Teen Week on the Wheel of Fortune.  Where the wheel is just a little tighter.  Rob.  Rob.  You don't have to loop up the wheel as much during Teen Week.  Spin nice.  Right. 
[01:34:00]  Not a sloppy spin there.  The natural grease still on the wheel.  Sorry, man.  Okay, Tina.  Tina.  You know how we like the fake O?  Actually, I don't really listen to your show that often, but I'm going to start.  I'm going to start.  I've been listening to it for the past hour, so.  What?  For an hour she's been listening.  But it's been really good, so I think I'm going to start listening.  What was your impression of the first 20 minutes?  Oh, well, I thought it was pretty good.  I thought it was really funny.  Oh, Rick.  Really, really funny. 
[01:34:30]  Stick around, Rick.  Hey, Tina.  What do you usually listen to?  I'm not really into listening to the radio.  I have a CD player in my car.  And what kind of music do I do?  What kind of music do you like?  I don't know.  Basically everything.  I listen to a lot of, like, Dave Matthews and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Dave Matthews.  You ever trip and think the hot dog's talking to you?  No.  Actually, I haven't.  But I knew someone who got a frozen hot dog.  You want it?  That's somewhere.  Whoa.  Hey. 
[01:35:00]  You know someone?  Yeah, she's the one I went to school with.  Had a frozen hot dog stuck somewhere.  Yeah.  She actually had to, like, go to the hospital for it.  You know, that's an old urban legend, though.  Isn't that an urban legend?  Yeah.  And then, you know what, starts crawling around.  Did she get bugs?  I don't know.  I never really explored that.  All right.  All right, Tina.  Okay.  The way we like these things is they got to be slow, build to a crescendo, 
[01:35:30]  and then just taper off in a very ecstasy.  Oh, no, you need the big finish, I think.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, the big, that's what I mean, the crescendo.  And then you end with the tail off.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, that's exactly it.  Okay.  Okay.  Because they can't just have the crescendo and then stop.  I hate that.  Oh, oh, Tina.  And then they're like, and one other instruction here.  Okay.  Do not give us directions.  Okay.  No directions and no names.  Don't say, oh, Anthony, or oh, Opie, do this, that, or the other thing.  Okay.  No turn around, oh, yeah, there, do that, or upper, lower.  Unless you want to tell 18 cities how big I am. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, my God.  That would be okay.  That would be fine in my book.  I'd rather she just do it the sounds, Opie.  Okay.  Just do the sounds.  I can't say, like, oh, God.  Oh, yeah, yeah, you can say that.  And don't use any dirty words.  Right.  No dirty words.  Okay.  You want to give her the words, Anthony, that she cannot say?  Okay.  Okay.  Anthony will give you the list of words you cannot say.  Well, it doesn't, I'm not going to say much.  I really don't. 
[01:36:30]  I feel that you just get to the action, no talk.  Well, this is for you and everyone else.  These are the words you are not to use during this.  Okay, ready?  Okay.  Don't use.  Okay.  Okay.  Oh, that one was nice.  Did you get that straight?  Yeah, I got it.  Never use.  Oh, okay.  Or.  Or.  Oh, okay.  Or. 
[01:37:00]  Or.  Okay.  Or.  Or.  Or.  Mother.  Or.  Or.  Well, what about.  No, I'm kidding.  All right.  Or even.  Oh, yes, of course.  All right, Tina.  Okay.  More riding.  All right, ready?  Yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh, my God. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Yes.  An abrupt ending, but besides that, very nice.  We like a little bit more of a tapering lying there and pleasure. 
[01:38:00]  Well, for future ladies, you know.  Pleasure.  After the last bone, give us a second or two before you say, is that good?  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, I got it.  More pleasure for you, but more pleasure for me.  All right, Tina.  Thank you.  Bye.  Great job.  Thanks.  Don't be a stranger.  Okay.  There she goes.  Bye.  Let's get to the clips.  More clips, Anthony.  More clips.  We love these.  These are from the fabulous 50s and 60s, I guess. 
[01:38:30]  They're instructing children on things like drugs, sex, bodily functions, adolescence, puberty.  Didn't you hate going through it just for the name of it?  Yes, the worst name.  I remember I freaked out when I was about, I guess I was about 12, 11 or 12, and I ran to my mother and I go,  I think I have breast cancer. 
[01:39:00]  Why would you say that?  Because my knee piece, my knee piece hurt.  They hurt and they were like getting like bumpy.  I've known you for eight years.  You've never told me that.  You might have had breast cancer.  It just popped up.  No, you know, I was a little hypochondriac.  And, and, uh.  So what was the problem with your sense of knee?  And they were like getting hard and stuff.  So my mother said, no, you're, you're just going through puberty. 
[01:39:30]  Puberty.  Puberty.  Puberty.  It involves the pubis.  You need an echo when you say that word.  Puberty.  Puberty.  Puberty.  I said, well, not just my knee piece.  Mom, look at my c***.  One of these days when we're, when we're feeling really silly on this radio show.  Yes.  We got to do a whole segment on, on words that just sound silly.  Well, puberty is up there. 
[01:40:00]  Puberty would, would be up there.  Puberty.  Okay.  Hey, pubert.  All right, Ant.  Yeah.  So, uh, we got some clips from the educational film.  And which one is this now?  Uh, being a girl.  Being a girl.  Being a girl.  It's all the menstruation.  Is it?  This is the menstruation.  All right.  And, uh, do you have the description as the mom explains to the daughter how to put the  porch swing together?  Every.  All right.  Perfect.  All right.  Let's start with the first clip.  The girl is very, um, she's, I guess, supposed to be 12. 
[01:40:30]  Probably.  And she's the, the girl that isn't as developed a 12-year-old as her friend is.  Yes.  So, her mother is now telling her because, actually, it started out where she's talking to her  mother how she wants to wear this pretty dress.  And the mother goes, you can't wear that.  Uh, and then she goes, well, my friend can wear this dress.  She's worn it.  And she goes, no, your friend is a little more developed than you are.  Oh.  So, she has to tell her how girls develop at a different age.  And, and then she figured she'd start to tell her about menstruation. 
[01:41:00]  You know, it must suck to be a girl where, like, your friends, they get the boobies first.  And then your mom sits you down and tells you, don't worry, you'll get the boobies.  There are some girls out there that never get the boobies.  Never get the boobies.  What do they think?  Well, there are guys that have to go in, like, the locker rooms at the junior high or whatever it is.  And, and they got the little pipsqueak.  The little clamshell yam bag with a knot of hair on it.  And then there's, you know, angry Big Jim Slade in the corner with, you know, the big bush and an anaconda. 
[01:41:30]  You know, and that poor kid's got to sit there with what amounts to a baby's binky.  I was hung like an acorn in high school.  No problem admitting it.  I didn't know, Tom.  I know exactly what he's saying.  I was on, like, five sports teams.  It was ridiculous.  I, I, I developed pretty much the, the norm, the av, average age, everything. 
[01:42:00]  But I wouldn't shower.  I just, I found that a little gay to be showering in, in school.  It's not like you're playing goddamn football for the NFL.  You're going out after the game to a party or something.  I'm going home.  I got to shower there.  You know what I mean?  Besides, you didn't want to show off your sensitive neeps.  I'm not showing off my neeps.  No, that was a little earlier.  That was like, I swear.  Did you have little swollen buds?  Or 12.  It was like, I'll explain exactly what it was like.  It was like just beneath the, uh, the, uh, actual neepy area. 
[01:42:30]  There were, each one had a very defined, hard, like, lumpy thing.  Right underneath the surface.  And it was the glands forming.  You know, come on.  Were you being felt up too much in, uh, in high school there?  No.  Here's me explaining.  During square dancing?  Here's me explaining.  Or my mother explaining.  Mama, I want ninny. 
[01:43:00]  No.  You didn't want ninny, mama.  I don't want my ninny.  You must have looked ridiculous.  No, you couldn't see them.  Let me, let me explain something to you, my friends.  It was, it was not visual at all.  It was, you could barely feel them.  But it hurt, like they were sensitive.  And it was like, uh, there.  Who had bigger neeps back then?  You or the 13-year-old girls?  The 13-year-old girls.  Like I said, and I will continue to say, there was nothing that you couldn't see.  Of course.  There was no protuberance whatsoever. 
[01:43:30]  And I'm sure the listeners have heard you, Anthony.  But if I press.  And they will, uh, and they will recite that back to you during, what did we learn tonight?  If I pressed, and within weeks, within weeks, it was gone.  It was gone.  They are not still there.  It was, uh, just below the surface.  And that was it.  That's all.  No, Alex, I cannot shoot milk. 
[01:44:00]  It was called going through puberty.  My neeps didn't hurt during that time.  Opie, many men develop in different ways.  And I didn't run to my mom and say, I think I have breast cancer.  Opie, people develop in different ways.  Some people might have sensitive neeps.  Others don't.  But yet develop, uh, into men down in the waist while they're 18.  You might look like a baby's binky in the shower.  Your neeps hurt. 
[01:44:30]  It might look like a hairless little clamshell yambet.  All right.  Very good.  Well, you know what?  Now we have to take a break, but our listeners will kill us.  Ah, they're going to kill us.  We got to at least play a few clips before we go to break here.  So we got some, uh, clips from being a girl.  Ah.  Ah.  What's the first clip about?  It's just the girl.  Being a girl.  Of course.  Being a girl.  But she's feeling icky.  Feeling icky?  All right.  Ah.  You know what?  What is it, Opie?  God damn it.  I knew it was A.  What is it, Opie?  It's A.  Who switched it to B?  It's always A. 
[01:45:00]  It's always A.  Did someone switch it to B?  Someone switched A to B.  Okay.  Is that what we're going with?  Because we were using the same pot, the B Metro pot, earlier.  So what are you saying officially?  Officially, it was B, and it was supposed to be A.  Everyone knows it's A at this point.  I love when you make it official.  We've been on in Albany six days.  Even they know it's A.  It's always A.  It's always F-ing A. 
[01:45:30]  But someone switched it to B.  For whatever reason.  Okay.  Thanks.  A clip from being a girl.  I think they do that just to annoy me so I go through this speech three times a week.  Go ahead.  Well, darling, that reminds me.  I bought some flowers for tonight.  Would you arrange them for me before the guest, or how do you do it so well?  Mom, it'll be okay if I take my bath first.  I feel kind of icky.  Oh, sure, darling.  Are you still menstruating? 
[01:46:00]  A little.  Did you buy the sanitary napkins for me today?  Mm-hmm.  They're not in your bed.  Now you just go take a nice bath, and we can fix the flowers later.  All right.  Get that stink off, you bitch.  She's feeling icky.  Maybe a shower.  I'm going to take a bath.  I'm going to sit here like I'm sitting in tomato soup.  Take a bath.  I feel, you know, icky.  I'm on the rag, riding the cotton pony, Mommy. 
[01:46:30]  Now the bath tub looks like Lipton tea.  Oh, God.  Take a bath.  Yes, your pads are right up on your bed.  She just heaves them on the bed.  There you go.  Why does the audio suck so bad?  I better change the sheets.  It was horrible.  All right, let's see.  Yeah, it is a little odd.  Hopefully the next clip is better.  In the back office.  A little crackly.  All right, let's try another clip from Being a Girl.  All right, Being a Girl.  Did you see that dress at the teen shop?  What dress?  The one that was pale yellow with flowers across here and a sash in the back. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, I know the one.  Oh, Mom, could I have it?  Here it is.  Libby, where would you wear a dress like that?  I'm as old as Jean and she wears clothes like that.  Oh, come here, Libby.  Jean is more developed than you are, dear.  You still have your little girl looks and shapes.  I know, but we're the same age.  But you're two different people.  Some girls grow up sooner than others.  Some not till they're 15 or 16. 
[01:47:30]  Some not till they're 15 or 16, huh?  And some never get big neepies.  Neepies.  Before you know it, a most important thing will happen.  What's that?  You'll begin to menstruate.  Do you know what that means?  It means you can have a baby.  That's right.  So your body prepares for it.  What do you mean? 
[01:48:00]  Well, your body makes a warm, soft place out of blood and tissue for a baby to grow.  And when there is no baby, the body gets rid of this blood and tissue through the lower part of the body.  That's menstruating?  Uh-huh.  And once it starts, it'll happen every month.  It never ends.  For a period of a few days.  That's why it's sometimes also called the period.  Right.  I don't know if I'll like it.  No, you won't.  Oh, Libby, you said you couldn't wait to grow up. 
[01:48:30]  It's called the woman's nightmare.  And believe me, the men are going to want to find that soft, warm place.  It's a soft, warm place, all right.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, Libby.  Oh, Libby.  It starts and it goes forever and ever until you dry up like a prune, like your mother.  Oh.  Isn't that great?  Yeah, one more before break.  Still the same mother-daughter team here? 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  Libby.  Come on, let me show you.  A clip from Being a Girl.  Yeah.  Come on, let me show you something.  Huh?  I know.  Sanitary napkins.  Go ahead and open them.  I've seen them in my magazine.  Would you like to learn how to use them?  I just, I gotta explain.  Yeah.  The box is as big as a Nike sneakers box.  Huge.  Huge.  Just laying on the bed.  It says Modest on them.  And they're just these giant, she brings out these giant pads. 
[01:49:30]  This is the, what we described earlier as the porch swing.  Yeah.  And then she brings the belt out and shows how it goes together.  And it looks just like a porch swing.  Guess I'd better.  All right.  You'll need this sanitary belt, too, to hold them in place.  It goes around your waist under your panties.  Then you put the short end of the napkin through the front fastener.  The front what? 
[01:50:00]  And the longer end through the fastener in the back.  See?  But won't it leak through?  No.  The napkin absorbs the menstrual flow.  Napkin?  Napkin.  A pillow.  It's not a napkin.  Yeah, why do they call it a napkin?  It's a pillow.  It's exactly, it looked like one of those airplane pillows they give you.  You can't put your head on a napkin at night to get a good night's rest.  It's a napkin.  Yeah, like a neck brace for when people have whiplash. 
[01:50:30]  You slap down on the back of your head.  All right, we have more clips, but we definitely have to take a break.  Unbelievable.  That's right, darling.  It looks like diarrhea coming out of your...  And don't worry if it looks like salsa.  Once you get hair around your...  The cliffs might catch them and hurt, but it won't hurt as much as having your first big... 
[01:51:00]  Ah, great.  Uh, Jared?  Yeah.  What's up, buddy?  He named me Jared.  Oh, by the way, Ed, John wants to know if you got your period right after the nip thing.  Shut up, you told me.  Hey, it's John, not me.  I did not.  Go ahead, Jared.  It's John, actually, from Cleveland.  Oh, sorry, bro.  Um, I have a daughter who's like eight years old.  How does a single parent, as a father, go about explaining this to their kids? 
[01:51:30]  Uh-oh, dude.  You gotta have a sister.  Do you have a sister?  Yeah, I have a sister.  There you go.  Have her aunt do it.  You gotta be ridiculous.  You'll sound ridiculous.  You can't be doing that.  It's like going down the aisle.  What size do you buy them?  You know?  Yeah.  Yeah, you gotta tell your sister to take one for the team.  Yeah.  Well, I hope she does it.  All right, man.  Hey, thanks for the support in Cleveland.  All right, you guys rock.  All right, cool.  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous. 
[01:52:00]  Right back.  Of course.  Right back.  Right back.  More clips from being a girl, but first, it's the F.U. line.  Thanks for calling, and here's the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Hi, this is Anna from the Nutty Nighty Contest, and I just want to give a big F.U. to the stupid f***ers who broke into my car over the weekend.  I'm going to find you, and I'm going to rip your goddamn balls off.  Next message.  Yeah, I'd like to give a big f*** to the unemployment office that f***ed up my claim and kept me on voicemail jail for a half hour. 
[01:52:30]  And then he asked me, press one if you don't have a phone.  How f***ed up are you?  How can I press one if I don't have a phone, you f***ing fool?  Go f*** yourself.  Next message.  Yeah, I want to leave a big F.U. to all the school buses on my way to work and on my way home from work.  They've got to drop the kids off at every other f***ing house.  Can't you just walk ten feet and all me to one stop, you lazy-ass little f***ing brat?  Jesus Christ.  Some people got to get home, you know? 
[01:53:00]  F*** you.  Next message.  Yeah, I want to give a big F.U. to the guy who stole my garbage can.  Cheap bastard couldn't go out and spend $20 on his own can.  He had to go and steal one.  I hope you come home and find some guy giving ten inches to your wife.  And she divorces you, takes the house, and you've got to go home and live in that garbage can, you stupid bastard.  End of messages.  O.P. and Ed for me.  What do you think this show is?  It's a mix between curious bemusement and outright horror.  It's absolutely disgusting. 
[01:53:30]  It's awful.  Silk and smash.  It's really bad, but it's really good.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Truly tasteless and not funny.  O.P. and Anthony Show.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  P.O.D.  Boom.  We're having a lot of fun today.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Thank you for checking us out.  Don't forget.  Whip them out Wednesday, tomorrow.  To be in it, you need that WOW sticker on your car.  Uh-huh.  Or a homemade WOW sign for those cities that don't have the bumper sticker. 
[01:54:00]  Right.  Need a bumper sticker in the New York area.  Self-addressed stamped envelope.  888 7th Avenue.  New York, New York.  10106.  All right?  O.P., you were in a fraternity, were you not?  Buy SIG, baby.  There you go.  Geneseo.  Well, this doesn't sound any different than any of the frat parties I've heard discussed by fraternity members.  From Winston-Salem, North Carolina.  Members of Wake Forest University fraternity.  were charged with animal cruelty and abandonment after a drunk, dehydrated, and sunburned pig was found unconscious in a park. 
[01:54:30]  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha!  The 23 members of Sigma Phi Epsilon.  The Sig Eps?  Yeah.  Could be sentenced to 90 days in jail if convicted of animal cruelty.  Animal control officers were called in when they found the 200-pound pig in the woods.  By a couple walking their dogs. 
[01:55:00]  I wonder if she was part of the Arethusa sorority, Anthony.  A vocal reference?  That made a lot of people in Geneseo laugh uncontrollably.  Is she a sorority girl?  I don't know.  It just says the pig had been abused, was unable to stand, and the animal was drunk.  Ha-ha!  The pig reeked of alcohol.  It could have easily died.  I don't understand how someone could think it would be so fun to abuse a pig. 
[01:55:30]  Ha-ha-ha!  The dehydrated pig had been burnt at one of the parties and drunk and was then just tossed  to the wayside outside of...  I guess she won't be going to classes any time soon.  I guess not.  Once again, another pig abused by a fraternity.  Is this a...  Now, all kidding aside, because I don't know, is it an animal or is it a sorority girl?  That is the only goddamn reason I even read this, is because it really doesn't make clear 
[01:56:00]  if it was an animal or just maybe a girl that wouldn't be voted a beauty queen.  Because a lot of times, the frats go what they call pigging or hogging, right?  You don't have to be in a frat to do that.  I've heard of it, you know, frat guys are pretty abusive with the girls.  Well, it is a badge of honor, Anthony, to go pigging and to find the hottest, the hottest,  the fattest.  Oh, hogging, right?  All right.  The fattest chicken. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, man.  Someone told a story about you in a bar wrapped around this big broad.  You were so drunk that you don't remember anything until you woke up, had a moment of  clarity and said, what am I doing with this big pack?  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  What?  I was just thinking that story in my head.  I thought I'd never told that story on the air.  Oh, no, no.  I told that once?  Me with the nippy story, never told on the air.  That one, I don't know if you told it on the air, but you told me.  I was in the Rat's Killer in Geneseo. 
[01:57:00]  Right.  It's no longer around.  It was, you know, the Rat's Killer bar.  It was actually in the basement of one of the dorms.  Yeah.  Common thing.  That's where I met young Buzzy.  Buzzy.  Who was peddling drugs.  He was peddling his drugs.  No, he was peddling bootleg Bruce Springsteen videos back then.  And Opie wanted to be cool.  That's right.  And not a square.  That's right.  I got so hammered.  This is a true story.  Were you on a one-way trip to Kicksville? 
[01:57:30]  I was getting my kicks, all right.  Kicksville.  I was just a freshman.  Just an innocent freshman.  And I started, I got wrecked.  Wrecked.  Yeah.  Blind drunk.  And I was making out with this chick.  And I guess I was making out in front of her.  Making out.  Well, I was making out.  Of course I was.  Like Brewer says, you want to make out?  You want to make out?  You know, making out.  Of course.  Get a little older, you don't make out as much.  You make out. 
[01:58:00]  You get right to the goods.  Screw that make out crap.  Make in.  I got video games to play.  Make in with my.  Right.  I'll give you a couple of kisses, but come on.  Right.  There you go.  Make in.  I'm playing Hot Shots 2 here.  3, whatever it is.  All right.  Anyway.  So, yeah.  I was blind drunk.  Hammered, dude.  Mm-hmm.  And I was making out with this girl.  So, and I guess I was starting to sober up as the night went on. 
[01:58:30]  Uh-huh.  And I'm starting to realize that a lot of people are looking at me.  They're just staring at you.  Staring.  And I'm, and I'm thinking, and in my mind at the time, I'm thinking I have the hottest  chick in the.  No, no.  In the rat's killer.  What to do?  What to do?  You thought you did.  And my arms, I thought, were around her.  He thought his arms were around her.  And I'm, I'm getting a little more sober, and I'm realizing they are openly laughing at 
[01:59:00]  me.  I'm like, what?  Openly laughing indeed.  Make a long story short.  Yeah.  It took me a long time to realize, but I was making out with a girl that had to be close  to 400 pounds, and I could not.  No, no, no.  And I could not get my arms around her.  What I thought was, I thought my arms were holding a real skinny chick.  It turned out that my arms weren't even getting around to her back. 
[01:59:30]  Wow.  Quite fat indeed.  You're one cool cat.  Yeah, cool, all right.  That's great.  We get back to the being a girl.  Yeah, come on.  Audio clips.  Being a Girl.  Little 12-year-old Libby on this fine film from the 60s, I guess.  Yeah, this is maybe early 60s.  This is one of our favorite things we've hit on over the years, these educational films. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, I've had the collection at my house for a while, and we've dug up some more for  today.  This is little Libby and Libby's mommy talking about Libby growing into a woman.  And on a future episode of the Opie and Anthony show, the educational film, Beware of the  Homos.  Beware of the Homos, the Navy film.  That's right.  All right, here's another clip with Libby.  Is the daughter?  Libby's the daughter.  Libby.  You're menstruating. 
[02:00:30]  Okay, Libby and her mom.  And Libby, see this blue polyethylene on the bottom and side?  Uh-huh.  That's a special moisture-proof shield to prevent accidents.  Besides, you should change to a fresh napkin every three or four hours.  What do I do with the one I take off?  No.  You wrap it in toilet tissue or a paper towel and throw it in a wastebasket.  Well, Libby, you rub it in your brother's face. 
[02:01:00]  It's just so rough being a chick.  You chicks have to change your pillow every three or four hours?  Oh, my God.  Your pillow.  Well, these weren't napkins.  These things were...  They were the big...  Yeah.  Like Rick said, the collars you have to wear after getting a little whiplash in a little  traffic accident.  You hear how she was talking about the polyethylene barrier?  It's made from a space-age polymer.  Oh. 
[02:01:30]  Oh.  She's got the big pillow with the big belt, and she's just showing the daughter how it  fits on the belt, and then she holds it up, and it looks like a porch swing.  It's just gigantic.  Ridiculously gigantic bulky thing.  Libby, you look ridiculous.  Libby, you can't afford to be looking ridiculous.  Libby.  All right, here's another clip.  Being a girl.  But, Mom, suppose it happens at school or someplace where I don't have this. 
[02:02:00]  You look in the restroom.  If there's not a napkin dispenser there, you ask the nurse or a teacher.  Oh, and Libby, I bought you this.  It's a special sanitary panty you might want to try instead of the belt.  The napkin fits right inside.  Ooh.  You might find it more comfortable than the belt.  The elastic loops hold the napkin in place.  Huh?  What?  Gee, Mom, they look just like my regular panties. 
[02:02:30]  Gee, thanks.  Wow, we sure had some important talk.  Wow.  I'll say we did.  Wow.  Wow.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Wow, I say we did.  Wow.  That's one important talk I'll never forget.  It'll affect me mentally forever, Mom.  Oh, Libby.  I've completely turned off to sex at any capacity, Mom.  That's fine, Libby.  When your father's hammering his heart into... 
[02:03:00]  Into the warm, moist place made of blood and tissue...  That is the most horrid little speech about menstruation.  Now, I guess the next clip we have is after Lil Libby actually gets it.  The film shows Libby sitting on a chair.  She's playing her guitar.  Is that the next clip?  No, this is the pool scene, right? 
[02:03:30]  Pool scene.  Yeah, with her friend.  The pool?  Oh, I thought that was after.  No.  Oh, she hadn't had it yet.  Look at me, chronologically retarded.  And now she's got some news for her friend, I see.  Some info.  Now she's going to the friend who already has it.  Right.  And another girl comes over who also knows what the curse is all about.  All right, here we go.  Hi.  How long?  About a year.  Do you?  Do I want?  I'm straight.  Of course, Billy.  How come you never told me?  I don't know. 
[02:04:00]  I always felt it was kind of personal.  And besides, it's nothing special.  It happens to every girl.  What happens to every girl?  Womanhood.  Oh, you mean the curse.  What do you call it?  The curse.  You know, being unwell.  Why do you call it that?  I don't know.  Some people do.  Hey, come on.  Let's go swimming.  No.  You go.  We'll be in later.  Okay, bye-bye.  See you.  Bye-bye.  I don't want to be swimming in that pool.  Oh, it's all going.  Yes.  Yes, Potter.  It's the curse.  You know, being unwell. 
[02:04:30]  Sounds like, what, diphtheria?  What the hell do you got?  You know, the curse being unwell.  I'm unwell.  Go away.  Tishy.  It's made of blood and tissue.  You're unwell with the curse.  Wow.  That is classic stuff, man.  Now do we go to Libby and the mom again?  And she's got a built-in flotation device where she jumps in the pool. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, forget it.  The pool level goes down two feet when it absorbs into that thing.  I don't like those old commercials.  It's like one of those snakes.  Yeah.  How awful is that?  She's got to go in the pool with that big thing.  It's like riding one of those blow-up toys.  You put a horse head on it.  Here's one with a blow-up horse head for when you go to the pool.  That way they won't know you're unwell. 
[02:05:30]  You're unwell.  Us guys don't have anything to be unwell about during that time.  Yeah.  Except for the fact you want to just hump everything like a chihuahua.  But I'm unwell.  All right.  Here's the mother back.  She's playing the guitar.  And it says next summer.  Or, yeah, it says next summer.  If you're driving right now and you're speeding, slow down like five miles.  Yeah.  You might want to.  You know, slow down about five to ten miles.  Because you might run off the road when you hear this one.  Here it goes. 
[02:06:00]  Guess what, Mom?  You're menstruating.  How did you know?  I can smell it.  Oh, I expected it.  How do you feel?  All right, I guess.  You don't seem, oh, quite as bubbly as usual.  Bubbly.  Are you sure you feel like bowling?  I'm all right.  Well, you're right, I guess.  There's no need to mope around.  Just because you're menstruating.  But don't overdo. 
[02:06:30]  Okay, I won't.  Mom, how'd you know?  We had to.  How'd you know?  We had to throw away the couch.  You're menstruating.  She knows.  Just be careful.  Don't overdo it.  And don't get around any cats, whatever you do.  They'll lunge at your little p***.  What an awful way.  The little pause was great because she's sitting in the chair playing her guitar. 
[02:07:00]  Playing her guitar.  The mother walks in and she just goes, you know, Mom, guess what?  And the mother looks.  There's a long, dramatic pause.  She looks with the look in her face like, my little girl is growing up.  And then she just smiles because she doesn't want to.  There's nothing bad going on.  You're menstruating.  Just play that quick part again.  Guess what, Mom?  You're menstruating.  She lost her little girl right there.  Right there.  You're menstruating. 
[02:07:30]  How did you know?  The trail from the kitchen to the couch.  Oh, my God.  I went up to your bedroom.  It looks like the Battle of the Bulge was fought up there.  What happened?  Of course I know.  Looks like your sister fell in a Cuisinart. 
[02:08:00]  Of course you're menstruating.  I saw the tissue.  Of course you're menstruating.  It smelled like we were at Coney Island, but we hadn't lived there in years.  Of course.  There's a beach within 100 miles of here.  Oh, God.  Here, take this Nike box of pillows upstairs and strap one on. 
[02:08:30]  That is some great stuff.  We got more, I think.  How did you know?  Oh, God, Rick.  No.  No.  No.  No.  You're menstruating indeed.  You're quite the cool cat.  Oh, boy.  How many more we got?  Let's keep going.  I love these. 
[02:09:00]  More clips from Being a Girl.  Cringe education.  People calling it.  You'll understand better if you know something about how you got to be a girl.  So let's begin by examining the facts of birth.  We should explain.  I think it's obvious to everyone, this is a whole different film.  Oh, it is?  Little Libby's Gone?  I think that's it.  Same film.  Same film, but now it's in the classroom with the health education.  Yeah, right?  Now, actually, each of you began life about nine months before you were born as a microscopic 
[02:09:30]  living organism, a single cell that resulted from the joining together of two other cells,  one from your mother and one from your father.  This little cell found a safe shelter in your mother's body in a soft, blood-rich organ called  the uterus.  Blood-rich.  That sounds lovely.  What happened in Buffalo? 
[02:10:00]  They dumped out of Buffalo?  What?  They're not hearing this in Buffalo?  Went to commercials with that clip playing in the background, then commercials stopped  and the clip was over.  What the F?  All we're getting is commercials.  Buffalo is dumping out.  The dickheads in Buffalo just played damn promo over the talk.  What's going on in Buffalo?  Stop it.  Come on.  And they play this crap in schools.  They better not be having a problem with this in Buffalo.  We're getting along so well with Buffalo. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  Trust me.  If we have to dump out of this stuff, we got the guy.  Yeah.  It's a pain in the ass.  Don't worry about it.  If he's not dumping out, it's okay.  Tell Ben or someone to get on the line with Buffalo and see if the problem is, like, with  them technically or what have you.  All right.  Blood-rich organ.  Great.  Anything else that's entertaining?  I don't like the teacher talk.  What?  You got something to me?  Yeah.  Just all the descriptions of the body. 
[02:11:00]  All right.  Let's hear.  Of course, you still have your little girl looks, but not for long.  Not for long.  You are approaching adolescence.  Adolescence.  A gland called the pituitary begins to encourage different parts of your body to turn into that  of a woman.  Little by little, each one of you growing differently in height, weight, and bone structure.  Your breasts will begin to develop, getting rounder and fuller. 
[02:11:30]  Hopefully.  Your hips will fill out, taking on softer, more womanly contours.  Ooh.  And the soft growth of hair will appear under your arms and in the pubic area.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  Your body will awaken internally.  Awaken.  And those organs that make you uniquely a girl will begin to develop, too.  Nice. 
[02:12:00]  Release the kraken.  Doesn't it sound like that?  This would unleash a beast upon the earth.  She made it sound like every woman's going to be a supermodel.  I know.  Like you come out of a pupa phase, crack open your old shell, have big cans and hips.  Right.  Sometimes it don't happen, lady.  Look at Stalker Patty.  Sometimes you get the huge hips and no cans.  Stalker Patty's 45 years old.  She still has that body of a 12-year-old that they're talking about.  You're like, when am I getting my hips and round breasts? 
[02:12:30]  Hi, teacher.  It didn't happen.  I haven't had it.  Where's my womanly beauty I'm supposed to have?  Get the body of an ant.  Hi, my name is Stalker Libby.  I have the body of Libby.  Patty, you're menstruating.  Yeah.  How did you know?  I saw all the dust. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, Buffalo's on the phone?  Yeah, what's going on?  What's going on over there?  This is the godfather.  Hey, Buffalo's on the phone, man.  What the hell's the matter with you guys, man?  We ain't cutting out of nothing.  Well, we got a bunch of...  It was just an accidental trip.  I don't know, something tripped the pot and it went off.  That's 30 seconds later.  Well, you just said the S word.  I like to say the S word.  Well, you're on the S.  Leave it.  You can't...  Leave it.  We just did there, Buffalo.  Yeah, everything's cool in Buffalo, all right?  All right. 
[02:13:30]  All right.  We're just getting to the bottom of it.  We're not sure if you spilled a LaBats on the board or something.  No, I didn't spill no LaBats on the board.  I drink Budweiser, my friend.  You love that LaBats up there.  No, I drink Budweiser.  All right.  Yeah, no, everything's cool, man.  Just something just got tripped accidentally.  We were getting a little scared because we got a nice relationship going.  You ain't got nothing to worry about down here.  We don't believe S.  All right, cool.  All right, man.  Thank you, Buff.  All right, baby.  There goes Buffalo.  All right, baby.  Buffalo represented the Opie and Anthony show last night. 
[02:14:00]  Huge.  During WWF Raw, by the way.  Tons of O&A wow signs.  Yeah.  All over the tube last night.  Two more clips.  Okay.  There are two ovaries, two narrow passageways called the fallopian tubes, and the uterus, and  they're all surprisingly small.  The uterus, not more than the size of a pear.  Fast forward.  The ovaries, not more than the size of walnuts. 
[02:14:30]  Look at mine.  It's fallen out.  Then there's the vagina.  Ooh.  The passage from the uterus to the outside of your body.  Gold.  That's what they call gold.  We struggle as gold.  Screw what's going on inside.  We just like that last section she was chatting about.  There's gold in there.  Isn't that sick?  Who needs to see the whole Holland Tunnel? 
[02:15:00]  No.  I just want to make sure it has a nice entrance.  Just the entrance has to be nice.  The toll plaza.  You just assume the rest is nice.  The rest is nice.  You know, I've got to describe it or see it.  I know it's functional.  Look at the beginning of the Holland Tunnel.  It's all decorated nice.  It's all it gets you to and from.  There's an easy pass lane right there.  Sometimes you get in there and there's tiles falling off the walls.  But you don't care.  You don't care because the entrance way looks nice.  Sometimes you ever are driving through and it's leaking on you.  They're like, where the hell is that coming from?  The tunnel opening. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  And you don't have to know.  It's just serving its purpose.  It doesn't matter because you saw the nice entrance way.  Right.  It made me feel good that the entrance way looked nice.  Made me feel safe.  Right.  That I was going into a nice place.  All right.  There you go.  Last clip.  Last clip.  And more of the teacher.  All right.  As you approach your womanhood, these organs begin to function.  And your very first mental cycle begins. 
[02:16:00]  Yay.  The ovaries release an ovum.  A single egg cell which finds its way into one of the fallopian tubes.  Very slowly, this little egg cell travels through this tube towards the uterus.  But before it gets there, the uterus prepares for it.  Builds up a special lining of blood and tissue.  Tissue.  So that this little egg cell can grow into a baby.  If it were fertilized by a male cell. 
[02:16:30]  Perish the thought.  Sometimes, as in my case, the man you're with doesn't want it.  And he'll punch you in the stomach repeatedly to dislodge this tissue.  Yeesh.  All right.  Get the pill in there.  Get an IUD in there or something.  Sometimes a condom is used.  It can be rolled on with the mouth.  If you're a pro.  Look at Rick. 
[02:17:00]  Look at Rick go with his sick mind.  Sometimes he'll finish in your A.  Like Meg, who's now dead.  Wow.  Good call back.  Even though a nice place is repaired in the front.  That's not good enough for some of the boys.  Sometimes people don't want babies.  So they'll plow the a** into a hot steaming batch of a** is fired there. 
[02:17:30]  Safely away from any danger of making a little bambino.  But you can just clinch and walk to the fertility clinic.  Where an unscrupulous doctor will take a turkey baster, suck it out, and put it in and make you pregnant.  I love it.  Great stuff. 
[02:18:00]  We'll have more.  We'll do this from time to time.  I can't wait for a homo navy, though.  Beware the homos.  Beware the homos.  Navy clip.  And other ones on the way.  I'd say we're...  This show is like a trip to Kicksville today.  Don't be a square.  We're not being square today.  Don't be a square.  We're in the middle of Kicksville.  Don't be a square.  It's the worst thing that could happen.  All right.  Well, we still got to talk about gay TV.  Gay TV.  Girls made a show, Underwear at School Dance. 
[02:18:30]  That's good.  That's going to be a huge story tomorrow.  Get your news first with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We'll do that in a bit here.  Okay.  People are requesting the John Vallby song, but it's out of...  You know what?  All right.  We'll try to fit that in, too, before we get out of here.  It's about as funny as a sinking school bus.  I have a strong stomach.  You guys made me blow chucks.  I'm great.  The grossest thing I've ever heard in my life.  O.N.A., my two new favorite whores.  You guys are really horrible.  The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:19:00]  What a couple of ass wipes.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yeah.  We have one more clip.  That's right, Libby.  We have one more clip from the educational films we were watching in the back room today, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  We just had Libby and her mom talking about menstruation.  We found one more clip of Libby and her mom.  The lost clip.  The lost clip. 
[02:19:30]  So, Rick, why don't we play that clip right now?  Here we go.  Libby, now that you're a woman, or growing into one,  you're going to have to learn to keep your man with your new womanly organs and ways.  Sometimes a man might want a little something extra than just straight, normal sex.  You know, sometimes he wants to bury his a** deep in your a**, and you have to comply to keep your man. 
[02:20:00]  Or he might run off with the secretary like your dad did.  You know, it's not fun all the time being a woman and having to take his cheesy a** in your mouth and hold him there until he a** all over your face.  But it's just another part of being a woman.  You know, drunk wicks whiskey breath in your face as he shoves a nightstick in your a** and beats you senselessly. 
[02:20:30]  It's all part of growing into a wonderful woman here in the 50s.  Occasionally, he might want to invite his friends over to watch you f**k the dog.  Sure, you don't want to do these things, but you need a man because women are useless here in the 50s. 
[02:21:00]  Sometimes he finds films from various European countries and wants to try them out.  Like taking a fistful of lard and just slamming it in.  Yes, it hurts, Libby.  But you'll keep your man.  And always remember, swallow the...  Never spit.  Always swallow the...  Spitters are quitters, Libby. 
[02:21:30]  Spitters are quitters.  Some girls don't get the big breasts.  They go to doctors and get implants.  And work at strip clubs, where Daddy goes to spend all his money in the champagne room getting f**k jobs.  That's okay, as long as he doesn't bring home diseases.  But he always seems to leave for the secretary, doesn't he? 
[02:22:00]  Just remember all this, Libby, as part of being a woman in the 50s.  A fist in the face and a big f**k in your...  At least he doesn't have to watch you cry as your face is buried in the pillow, Libby.  Tell your friends about this.  You'll have to learn how to give during your...  Wasn't sure if I'd get away with saying it in this context. 
[02:22:30]  When a woman's time comes every month, she has to expel certain blood and tissue.  At this time, her f**k can't be used for that.  So you'll have to learn how to suck a f**k like a champ.  Okay, Libby, stop crying now and pulling your hair out in clumps and learn how to be a woman. 
[02:23:00]  During the time of expelling this tissue, a man may have to learn to earn his red wings.  Oh, what we call crime scene sex.  Your little bed's gonna look like Iwo Jima.  I remember the first time your father wanted to have sex with me during that time. 
[02:23:30]  Well, let's just say the bed looked like Omaha Beach on D-Day.  That's when you have to learn how to either roll over or take a shot of f**k to the face, Libby.  And then there's threesomes, Libby. 
[02:24:00]  Threesomes are fun, fun, fun, Libby.  Just don't let photographers catch you on the steps of the court.  Libby, put your goddamn clothes back on.  I hope that helps you, Libby.  Now go to the pool and tell your f**k rag little friends.  Well, that was a long clip, Rick.  That was the last clip, Opie. 
[02:24:30]  Ah, yeah.  Being a woman in the fifties.  Right.  Sounds tough.  Thank God things have changed.  All right.  Hey, Kathy, what's up?  Hey, guys, how you doing?  How you doing?  Listen, I have three kids, two of which are daughters, eight and five.  And let me tell you, when it comes time for me to explain this whole thing for them,  the only thing I'm going to be able to have in my mind is this bit you guys did, 
[02:25:00]  and they are not going to take me serious at all.  No?  No.  Oh, yeah, I don't know.  I like the old learn it on the streets method.  You know, it seems to work the best.  I grew up in a house of five girls, plus my mother.  And let me tell you, my mother never sat us down and told us anything even related to that tape.  We all learned from each other.  All right.  Thank you, Kathy.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Let them learn out at Hunts Point when they did the hooker special. 
[02:25:30]  Ramona.  What's up, Ramona?  Ramona.  I just wanted to thank both of you for the sex education I never got at home.  Thank you so much.  I don't think I would have gotten better if I even was up at Hunts Point.  Well, that last clip was pretty much the most accurate one we've heard so far.  Well, see, I'm having problems with you, my man.  Any clue?  I guess most of it would be down.  I mean, you know, it's always worth a shot.  Yeah. 
[02:26:00]  All right.  Thank you.  There goes Ramona.  All right.  Girls made a show underwear at school dance, Anthony.  This is going to be a big story tomorrow.  L.A.  Angry parents demanded the resignation of a California high school vice principal Tuesday  because she lifted the skirts of teenage girls at a dance in front of men and male classmates  to make sure they were wearing appropriate underwear.  So she lifts it to make sure it's appropriate.  What's appropriate?  I think she was looking for thongs. 
[02:26:30]  She didn't want thongs?  Let's read on here.  Parents at Rancho High School in suburban San Diego say the vice principal, Rita Wilson.  Rita Wilson?  That's Tom Hanks' wife.  Is lifting up skirts or is it just a similar name?  Made the girls prove that they were not wearing thong underwear before they were allowed into the dance on Friday.  They had to line up and she lifted all their skirts up.  In front of everyone.  In front of everyone?  This stuff is in the paper all the time.  It just amazes me.  Kind of hot now. 
[02:27:00]  Now it's kind of hot.  In some cases, said Rancho Bernardo, parent Kim Teal, girls also were made to partially undress if Wilson or another teacher suspected that they weren't wearing bras.  Wow.  Who comes up with these ideas and thinks it's going to just be fine?  Like, this will be a great thing.  We'll just get the girls online, make them undress, lift their skirts up.  And, boy, the parents are going to love this because we're making sure they're wearing the right panties. 
[02:27:30]  The right panties.  No, people are going to freak out and you're going to get fired.  These girls feel violated.  Of course they do.  Said Teal, whose daughter Rebecca, a sophomore, was asked about her underwear but escaped a search after telling Wilson that she was not wearing a thong.  One girl just cried after having to tell her father this story.  She was hiding her head in a sweatshirt.  I hear that was a little libby because as she lifted the skirt she was wearing that big ridiculous belt.  The porch swing.  The porch swing.  She was checking for porch swings.  Porch swings. 
[02:28:00]  After a while, the girls finally got the idea that they shouldn't say thong when they were asked.  And it goes on.  Oh, because they said, what are you wearing?  And they said thong and then they'd look?  Yeah.  It sounds like Rita was getting a little kind of hot.  Teachers also checked several boys who were wearing toga-style costumes.  And girls were often asked about their bras.  I just got a call from one mom who said her daughter was wearing a poodle skirt and an off-the-shoulder top.  And a teacher reached right out and grabbed the front of it and pulled it down to check. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, man.  These people are screwed.  Totally.  Stupid.  Stupid.  Stupid.  People are so funny, man, with the instant feedback.  What?  And, Libby, if you're laying in bed and won't give it up and two guys are next to you, just have them f*** off with each other.  Well, that sounds better with the music. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, that's a different one.  Yeah.  It's track nine, I believe.  Yeah, but it went to eight.  And remember, Libby, if you're with two men laying in bed named Norton and Voss, and you won't give it up, just have them f*** off and flip a coin.  Remember, the loser gets to f*** you.  Sex is fun. 
[02:29:30]  You know what you're making down there, Libby?  Hatsu.  Hatsu.  Remember, Libby, always wear a hat.  All right.  George, what's going on?  I got a tape of what happened in Buffalo.  Huh.  He has a clip of what happened in Buffalo.  Who cares?  We got to the bottom of it.  Well, when I called, you know, it was still fresh.  It was still topical.  It's topical.  Yeah, being on hold is drunk. 
[02:30:00]  All right.  Well, thanks, Andy.  No, that's okay.  All right.  Thanks, my friend.  All right.  All right.  You know what?  We're getting a lot of requests for the John Valby song.  Why don't we play that, Anthony?  Okay, which one was this?  This was, we got to set it up, because out of context here, it's, it's, oh, it's about the Catholic priest thing.  It's a little rough.  Yeah, what are the bishops saying about radio today?  Oh.  Well, one of the, um, one of the fine people, Opie, from the FCC is going around trying to garner support from the Catholic bishops to clean up radio and television. 
[02:30:30]  I've been going to, and believe me, the Catholic bishops are jumping on this like a young boy.  They're jumping on it.  You know why?  It's a diversion.  It's a diversion.  How about they clean up the confessionals?  Right.  When you've got to squeegee the floors of confessionals like a peep show floor, then maybe it's time.  I don't think radio is your big problem. 
[02:31:00]  So now, as a diversion, they're going to now jump back on the bandwagon and trying to clean up this harmful, because they say, get this, it's harmful to children.  I can think of some more things the Catholic bishops ought to think about as being harmful to children than television and radio.  I think priests b*** inside b*** of children is bad, much worse than what you hear here on this show.  So they, you know, the church is f***ed up, and they're trying to distract people away from what's going on. 
[02:31:30]  And John Valby wrote a little tune about Catholic priests and what they've been up to with the young boys over there.  And we play it now.  And then we do, what do we learn?  That's what we do.  I just played up in Boston about a month ago, and you're going to suck. 
[02:32:00]  Father pedophilia, picks up a kid in a vestibule after the mass.  Presses his ass.  Later that evening, corners an altar boy in the confessional booth. 
[02:32:30]  Baptizes his tooth.  Follows Catholic perverts.  Where do they all come from?  All those church donations.  Pump up some young boys' ponds.  Cardinal denial.  Transfriends the priest to a parish that's right down the street.  It's full of fresh meat. 
[02:33:00]  Bishop McBugger.  Passing communion with one hand still under his frock.  Pounding his c*****.  All those former terrorists.  Let's throw them in the clink.  All those Irish Catholics.  No wonder why they drink. 
[02:33:30]  Rain wreck radio.  Like a bunch of people cheering on a race.  That's going to make a sweeper.  Oh.  Scum.  Anthony.  Slime.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Running out of show.  It's O&A.  Your buddies.  Hello.  A couple things real fast.  Tomorrow's Whip Them Out Wednesday, Anthony.  Yes, it is.  Even though it's now Whip Them Out Whenever.  Oh, my.  That's what WOW stands for.  Ladies, if you see the WOW on cars and you feel like it, you know, you can flash them. 
[02:34:00]  Guys will like that.  But get a WOW in your car for tomorrow's festivities.  If you don't have a WOW bumper sticker, you could make that homemade WOW sign.  Right, Anthony?  Right.  And if you need a WOW bumper sticker in the New York area, a couple things real fast.  Send a self-addressed stamped envelope to 888 7th Avenue, New York, New York, 10106.  And we'll send it right out to you.  That address is up on opandanthony.com.  Tomorrow we're doing a sticker stop, a WOW sticker stop at Riverfront Stadium in Newark. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, yeah.  This is going to be great.  This is going to be probably the best sticker stop we've ever done.  Not only the return of our own favorite sticker stop guy, veteran Black Earl,  back on the road for the Opie and Anthony Show with his first sticker stop of this WOW season.  Not only Black Earl joining him, his co-host for this event,  this sticker stop, none other than Frenchie.  Frenchie and Black Earl together. 
[02:35:00]  I would go just to watch them fight.  They can't stand each other.  Great.  Why don't you go to that side of the van, you coon?  That's going to get over.  Of course.  So you get your WOW stickers tomorrow at Riverfront from 4 to 6.  Also, you can pick up your tickets for the 2002 Opie and Anthony Celebrity Softball Game.  That goes down June 1st, Riverfront Stadium, Newark.  Tickets go on sale tomorrow at 5, Anthony.  Suck it. 
[02:35:30]  Through Ticketmaster Outlets and the Riverfront Stadium box office.  Tickets are $10.  And I've got to say, once again, because a bunch of dicks trying to rain on our parade like they always try to do.  Right.  Yeah, we raised the ticket price from $5 to $10 to cover costs because we're trying to make it even bigger than the last one.  To make it better.  And I can't believe we even have to say this, but, I mean, management wanted like, they wanted like a $20, $25 ticket.  We're like, no, because we do try to keep things relatively cheap and free for you guys.  Yeah. 
[02:36:00]  But these dicks had to say, oh, it was $5.  Look at what syndication has done to you guys.  Anthony and I, let me make this perfectly clear, will not make a dollar off this event.  No.  We don't want to.  It's to cover costs, possibly a charity and other things.  That's it.  We are not putting money in our pocket for this event.  It's not a $25, $30, $40 ticket.  It's $10.  You spend more than that when you go to the movies, please.  And it's a whole day full of hijinks and excitement. 
[02:36:30]  We've added all sorts of stuff.  We're going to have booths set up all over the place.  The roster of celebrities will be a little better than last time.  You'll actually recognize most of the players on the field from the radio show.  Hopefully get in the Titanic, you know, blow-up slide thing.  Yeah, going to be games and stuff.  All kinds of things.  Things.  Festival atmosphere.  And we're trying to get a band to play.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, you're working on that, right? 
[02:37:00]  Working on it.  A band that we've worked with in the past to come up from Philly.  Mm-hmm.  And jam some tunes as everyone's going to their seats.  $10 for a whole day full of fun.  It's going to be a bargain.  There you go.  Also, Anthony, we're hitting the road next week.  Thursday and Friday.  Thursday in Philly.  Friday in D.C.  Can't wait.  It's our first visit to D.C.  Next week.  Yeah, I said that, right?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Next Thursday and Friday.  Yeah.  We're going down for Norton Show to D.C.  Figured, what the hell?  Philly's on the way.  Let's stop there, too.  Going to D.C. 
[02:37:30]  We got a couple things going on in both those cities.  Couple of things?  Couple contests.  Yeah.  Remember the strangest, wildest, craziest thing you could bring to us?  I thought it was sick.  We did it in Boston.  We did it in New York, right?  We did it in Boston, and then New York pretty much topped it with cancerous organs.  Yeah.  Well, Boston gave us a guy that brought his own spleen down.  Yeah.  And one of our listeners ate a piece of the spleen.  That was sick.  But New York came through, and they brought us a cancerous boob and a cancerous esophagus. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  A doctor came down with these things in a pail and opened it up and laid out a cancerous  breast right here on the console.  We had cancer all over the studio.  So, we will be doing the same contest in Philly and D.C.  Because we love when you guys, you know, hang out at the station when we're doing our show.  Oh, yeah.  Philly, Ben just handed me a note.  Huge things happening.  Huge things happening.  Huge things happening as the grand prize of this little contest. 
[02:38:30]  That day.  All right.  And D.C. is working on a huge prize as well.  So, our first little foray into D.C.  Yeah, you guys better show up at the station.  We're going down there.  Going down.  Saying hi.  All right, Anthony.  It's time to play What Do We Learned on the O&A Show.  And, man, today was a very educational show.  Literally.  Very educational today.  Yeah.  Stones fan from New Hampshire.  I learned on the O&A Show today.  Hmm.  Where the F do I start?  Well, Stones fan ain't getting any this week because his wife is unwell. 
[02:39:00]  Unwell.  I'm unwell.  He also learned spitters are quitters.  Sheep lover.  Always good for a few.  He learned today it's called the curse.  The curse.  Jay the drunk.  I learned that the good drugs are in the garage.  In the garage.  That's right.  Mike from Philly.  I learned that if you are a square, you can hop a train to Kicksville with your old pals,  Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  He also learned Earl is as slow as an ovum. 
[02:39:30]  Dude from Philly gets it.  Sure.  God, I love that.  Sure.  Vinny from Philly.  I learned today, finally, after 30 years, the case of the murdered hot dog on Market Street  has been solved.  Jerry from Edison.  I learned today, the small dead Italian one is the son.  Should have done that as Brian Regan.  Sorry, Jerry.  Even Albany knows it's always, always A.  And if the house smells like Coney Island, then someone's unwell. 
[02:40:00]  Unwell.  Todd from Buffalo.  I learned today, Kicksville is just north of Squaresville.  And Opie likes the girls with the big, that's stupid.  That's stupid.  Hurry.  Jersey Gary learned hot dogs have faces, a wife, and seven kids to support.  Hi.  He also learned barbs are tougher to kick than the big H.  He learned Tina really likes the fifth bleep. 
[02:40:30]  That's real good.  He'll be watching Teen Week on Wheel of Fortune where the wheel's a little tighter.  Nice.  Ant's knee, oh, Ant's knee deep in man-ass.  The cookies are after Ant.  And Opie's computer has VD.  Al Mack.  Today I learned to run away from the flash.  Oh, run from the flash.  Tom from Philly.  Lots coming from Philly today.  Threesomes are fun, Libby, unless you get photographed.  On the courthouse steps.  And he also learned Tom Hanks' wife likes to lift up high school girls' skirts. 
[02:41:00]  Greg from Cleveland, you bastard.  LSD can make you believe you can wrap your arms around a 400-pound woman.  I ran away screaming.  Tuttle from New York.  I learned that Earl has been here so long, he has earned his own water fountain.  Spitters are quitters.  Oh, boy.  Let's go to Leo.  Leo, what did you learn?  Hey, fellas.  I learned that girls like to wow when they're menstruating. 
[02:41:30]  Very good.  Later, fellas.  All right, bye.  I think I'm trying to see if we covered them all.  Let's go to Karen.  Hey, Karen, what's up?  Hey, Karen.  You guys, how are you?  Hey, Karen.  You're Karen.  I am Karen.  Why did you say hey, Karen?  Because, I don't know.  All right.  It's been a long day.  What's up, Karen?  But I did learn something.  Okay.  I learned that no matter what the girl says, there is no free phone sex. 
[02:42:00]  That's right.  That is something we learned.  That's right.  Very good.  All right.  Take care, you guys.  All right.  We got a lot of offensive feedback today, but Jim has one that we didn't cover.  Go ahead, Jim.  Yo, guys.  Hey, man.  Having the curse should always be described as a World War II battlefield.  Yes.  Yes.  Some kind.  And also, puberty, always funny.  Always funny.  Puberty.  Unless you're Ben.  Ben didn't think it was funny. 
[02:42:30]  One last thing.  Sanitary pads used in swimming pools should always have horsey heads attached.  Very good.  What an education he got today.  I didn't realize we taught everyone so much today.  Chris learned that Ant did not get his period.  No.  And that he did not have breast cancer.  Thank God.  I was 12 years old.  It was puberty.  I thought, because my neapies were tender.  You're Opie, then I...  I understand.  Something was wrong.  But my mom each sat me down and told me I was going through puberty. 
[02:43:00]  Rob, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  What's up, Greg?  What's up, Tony?  Greg and Tony show.  Today I learned that the Opie and Anthony show is worse than being raped by a Catholic  priest.  Exactly.  Ah.  Good day, gentlemen.  According to the Bishops.  All right.  Two more, and then I got a hockey game to watch.  Oh, that's right.  And we didn't throw a Brewer bid on.  Oh, I'm dying over here.  Brian, what's up?  I learned so much today that it made dropping out of college seem like a good idea. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  I learned that Opie is hung like an acorn.  Oh, that was in high school, Mike.  In high school.  I had a huge comeback.  And I also think I'm the only one that finds it disturbing that Anthony calls them kneebees.  Well, I'm just trying to get them through.  Kneebees.  All right.  You know, whenever you talk about your junk, usually saying comeback shouldn't be used in  the same sentence.  That would be huge comeback.
