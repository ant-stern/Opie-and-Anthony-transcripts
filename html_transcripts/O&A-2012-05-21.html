<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts discussing their busy weekend and upcoming guests, Mark Maron and Andrew Dice Clay.  They launched into a news segment covering John Jones' Bentley crash and DUI,  the exorbitant cost of Bentleys, and a humorous story about Rich Voss' online car purchase.  This transitioned to a discussion of Robin Gibb's death, prompting the playing of Bee Gees songs from *Saturday Night Fever*, accompanied by sexually suggestive comments and jokes referencing *Boogie Nights* and *Step Brothers*.  They debated *Saturday Night Fever*'s ranking among top-selling albums, comparing it to works by Michael Jackson, Pink Floyd, and AC/DC.  The news segment continued with Will Smith slapping a prankster, a review of Will Smith's career including a clip of him singing "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air," a brief mention of the Carson documentary, and Whitney Houston's daughter's Billboard Music Awards appearance.  Finally, they covered box office results for *Battleship*, *The Dictator*, and *The Avengers*,  followed by a discussion of *Game of Thrones*, HBO/Showtime programming, and the departures of Kristen Wiig, Jason Sudeikis, and Andy Samberg from *SNL*, concluding with criticism of a new Adam Sandler film's poor box office performance.

The show then moved to a segment featuring a movie idea – a crude, comedic father-son story involving Adam Sandler – leading to offensive jokes about sex and parenting.  They discussed Andy Samberg's film career,  criticizing his past work with vulgar language.  Audio clips included a profane critique of Paul McCartney's "Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey," a vulgar assessment of Sofia Vergara and Jesse Tyler Ferguson's Billboard Music Awards hosting, speculation on Van Halen's tour cancellations (including a David Lee Roth clip and a caller's concert anecdote), and a discussion of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi's death, laced with offensive generalizations.  Further topics included Mark Zuckerberg's wedding and IPO timing (with offensive language and racial slurs), criticisms of the Facebook mobile app (using profanity), discussion of the Triple Crown, and a heated classroom recording of a teacher and student discussing politics, prompting more profanity, racial slurs, and offensive commentary from the hosts.  They also touched on potential Joe Biden replacements, Hillary Clinton’s future, and delivered a sexually explicit advertisement for Ashley Madison.  Marc Maron was scheduled as a later guest.

Comedian Mark Maron was interviewed in-studio, preceded by a crude AshleyMadison.com advertisement. The interview focused on Maron's podcast "WTF," his interview style (minimal research), notable guests (Michael Cera, Danny McBride, Lisa Lampanelli, Paul Poundstone, Norm Macdonald, Todd Glass, and Conan O'Brien), and his garage studio. He shared anecdotes, including Todd Glass' coming out and the challenges of interviewing reserved guests. He discussed his podcast's evolution from political commentary to a more personal approach, his time at Air America, health concerns (a potential brain tumor and insurance difficulties), and his dislike for New York City.  The conversation then shifted to the challenges of comedy, including joke stealing (with a discussion about Robin Williams), being bumped from gigs (David Spade and Carlos Mencia), negative publicity (Dice Clay and Joe Rogan), and the difference between his interview style and Opie and Anthony's. Maron recounted attempts to interview Shecky Green and his surprising interaction after reading a negative article about Green. The arrival of Andrew Dice Clay concluded this segment.

Andrew Dice Clay joined the show, with initial discussion of his weight loss.  The conversation then moved to his podcast experiences (including Mark Normand and Joe Rogan), his confrontations with unruly audience members, his candy preferences (a preference for "shitty" candies), his smoking habits, his upcoming Boston stand-up special, and his views on modern women (using vulgar and misogynistic language). He shared anecdotes about past performances, including a ghostly encounter and a fight with a heckler's wife, and did a John Travolta impression.  His upcoming book and potential movie adaptation (including a meeting with James Franco) were also discussed.  The segment concluded with promotion of his stand-up special and discussion of his clothing style and designer, Jeff Hamilton.

A final segment with Dice Clay heavily focused on his upcoming Showtime special, scheduled for New Year's Eve 2013 and filmed in Boston. Ticket sales and a surprising encounter with children in the audience (leading to a highly offensive tirade about parenting and women's choices) were discussed. He also shared anecdotes about past performances, including a large security guard removing a heckler, discussed his children (including his son's prom and a story about his daughter), and shared his experiences raising them, expressing his views on mothers' lack of support. A coded story about his brother-in-law, a Navy SEAL, was also shared. The segment ended with promotional plugs for his shows and a Twitter contest; throughout this segment, Dice Clay used highly profane and sexually explicit language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey!  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yip yip yip yip yip yip yip yip yip yip yip yip yip yip yip yip.  Morning.  Hello.  Hello.  Fucking Monday, huh?  Here we are.  Here to entertain.  Fucking Monday.  That's what we do.  It's all we do. 
[00:00:30]  Dice coming in today.  Yeah, apparently so, huh?  Until we get to all go home early.  We'll just tell him to turn off the lights when he's done.  Yeah.  Guy can talk a bit, huh?  Well, sure.  That's the Dice Man.  That's the Dice Man.  The Dice Man a-cometh.  Yeah.  I'll come later.  9 o'clock for Dice.  Mark Maron's coming in at 8 o'clock, too.  Oh, yeah?  He's another guy that likes to talk.  So it's perfect for us today.  What are we going to do? 
[00:01:00]  I'm going to sit back and chill and enjoy the show.  And chill.  Chill.  God, busy weekend, huh?  Yeah.  For news and such.  I'm just looking at this John Jones.  I didn't have that.  You didn't know.  No, until you said that.  Yeah, John Jones, UFC champion.  He crashes Bentley, I think, outside or around Binghamton, New York.  And got a bit of a DUI in the process.  Yeah.  If you could hold this car, there's nothing they can do to help you there. 
[00:01:30]  Even if the cops want to help you, they can't.  Nah.  What is a Bentley?  Like $40,000 or something like that?  Probably a little, perhaps more than that.  Yeah.  You get a Bentley for about 40, 50 Gs.  How much are a Bentley?  Probably, perhaps more than that.  Maybe, maybe 60 Gs.  Perhaps.  I think they're like, what, a quarter million?  Yeah, they're pretty expensive.  At least, right?  Look up the Bentley.  How much does the Bentley cost?  And you know John Jones had a good one.  He didn't do a Rich Voss and fucking get it online.  I got it online and the trunk smelled like cabbage. 
[00:02:00]  He is a dunce.  He really is stupid.  He really is dumb.  Oh, look at that.  Yeah, that's...  How much is the Bentley?  A lot of numbers.  Yeah, about 200 grand.  Yeah, 200 grand.  But, you know, he had his all fucking pimped out probably, right?  He was all drunk and shit.  He was drunk and shit.  Yep.  They say what he blew.  The number was?  I think it was like a 3.8.  Oh, that's pretty good.  Right there.  I don't know. 
[00:02:30]  That's like fatal.  I think.  Let me see.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  No, it doesn't really say what he blew.  5 a.m. in Binghamton, New York.  Yeah, he crashed into a pole.  Wow, that's drunk.  Those things will jump out at you.  That's drunk.  Yeah, a pole, there's no excuse.  Unless you're scared or, you know, it's snowing, something like that.  If you just hit a pole, yikes.  That's drunk.  That pretty much tells the cops right when they wheel up on the scene, like, all right,  we better check this guy out. 
[00:03:00]  Can't make Dana White happy, huh?  I'm glad he didn't get hurt.  He has a clean image, man.  Oh, yeah, he does.  He has an amazing image.  Oh, he's had a hell of a run.  He's doing a little partying.  What are you going to do?  It happens, right?  Yeah.  Clean image, though, you know.  You still want to drink a little bit.  Drive.  Get a driver.  I know, that's just that.  UFC champion.  Get a driver.  Get a goddamn driver.  Well, especially if you have a Bentley.  I think they give you a driver with a Bentley if you buy one.  Yeah, don't they come with a...  I really believe most people don't drive their own Bentleys. 
[00:03:30]  A chauffeur.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's one of those cars where you get a driver.  So, yeah, that happened over the weekend.  And then, what, yesterday we lost Robin Gibb.  Oh, where did he go?  Jim Jeffries was the one that, you know, brought to our attention that he wasn't doing well.  Didn't he lapse into a coma and then came out of it?  Yeah.  Like, he went into a coma.  Everybody was like, oh, that's it.  A couple weeks ago.  He's dead.  And then he's like, I'm all right.  He popped out of it.  Yeah.  For a couple months and now, or a couple weeks. 
[00:04:00]  And that was it.  Now he's dead.  Now, uh...  62?  Yeah.  High by nine.  Bee Gees were fucking huge.  Yes, they were.  Even if you were a rock guy, you kind of knew and listened to some Bee Gees.  They were everywhere.  It's what you call your guilty pleasure.  Yeah.  I think.  Oh, E-Rock's ready today, everybody.  Because he was warned.  Straight from his iPod.  What is this?  How deep is your love?  Which one is this? 
[00:04:30]  No, this is Night Fever.  Oh, yeah, Night Fever.  This is the big one.  This was a big album.  From the movie.  I would have went with tragedy.  Because it's a tragedy.  We lost Robin Gibb.  But this album for them was giant.  The Saturday Night Fever soundtrack.  Fuck yeah.  This is...  This is the scene in Saturday Night Fever where John Travolta's out on the dance floor.  And he just starts sucking a guy's dick.  Yeah.  Just sucking his fucking cock.  This is where the massage therapist folds up the table and marches out.  And here's your wig, sir. 
[00:05:00]  Jizz on the dance floor.  That's why everyone's sliding.  Yes.  They can do their fucking moves.  Yeah, this is the biggie.  Yeah.  I have to admit, I fucking like this shit for a while.  Sounds great.  This was...  And you hear this on the radio.  I don't know, man.  Like you said, it's kind of...  What saves you?  You go, it's a guilty pleasure, man.  Yeah, that saves you.  We all have guilty pleasures.  This, though, was something that if it came on your car radio as you were driving around, 
[00:05:30]  you had to roll the windows up and you couldn't let any of your friends see that it was on.  But you'd kind of leave it on.  Yeah.  But the rest of the faggots were doing the same thing.  I know.  But, you know, you're a rock guy.  And I'm listening to fucking REO Speedwagon, for the love of God.  Of course.  Right in the storm.  Rockin'.  Stayin' Alive is what a phenomenal song that is.  Yeah.  This record is great.  It was disco.  Disco was for fucking losers.  Oh.  I was embarrassed by everyone that did a Stayin' Alive joke on Twitter yesterday. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, no.  Did they?  Oh, God, dude.  No one in this room did, right?  Okay.  I didn't address it.  I didn't think.  All right.  Stayin' Alive was trending because everyone was fucking going with the Stayin' Alive joke.  Oh.  I guess he's not Stayin' Alive anymore.  I think this was the beginning segment where he's walking down the street holding the paint  can.  Oh, yeah.  Actually, it was full of cum.  And then he chugged it, right?  He would use, like, a little ice cream scooper and then scoop it into his mouth down at the 
[00:06:30]  hardware store where he got a raise by blowing his boss and threw it over the side of the  Barrazzano Bridge so no one would find the evidence.  Yes.  Paint can full of cum.  Tony, I only wanted to massage you.  Oh, no.  And right.  Fucking E-Rock's on it, though.  We got two songs in it already.  My favorite song off this album, I think it was Nights on Broadway.  Oh, yeah.  That was another biggie.  Which one was Nights on Broadway?  Uh-oh.  Yeah. 
[00:07:00]  This is the one.  Was this a deeper track?  Yeah, yeah.  I think it might be, right?  Yeah, this one wasn't one that was...  Although, every song on the album...  Was this off the movie or no?  I think this is off the soundtrack, right?  Oh, yeah.  It's a huge...  Not as big as the other ones, but I always liked this one better.  Here we are.  Here we are.  In the room of strangers.  I don't really know this one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Standing in the dark. 
[00:07:30]  Standing in the dark.  It's where your eyes are the same.  Love these guys.  And now it kicks in with a BG sound.  What a unique singing style.  It's so hard.  You and your brother used to sing some of this shit, man.  It's so harmonic, it's fun to do.  It's a nice show.  It's all three-part.  It's the big hook here.  Got to give it to them, Gibb brothers. 
[00:08:00]  They were great.  They knew how to harmonize, right?  They had a big career going in the 60s, too.  Did they?  Yeah.  No one really remembers because it was overshadowed by their disco Saturday Night Fever career.  But, yeah, they had some songs back in what they called the day.  So what was on this album?  Run through the track listing.  God damn it.  Oh.  In the event of something happening to me. 
[00:08:30]  This is one of the old ones.  I don't know this.  Yeah.  There is something that would like you want to see.  It kind of had a Beatles feel at some of the times, too.  Yeah, yeah.  This kicks in, though.  You'll probably recognize it.  This is very Beatles.  Yeah.  Wow.  Have you seen my wife, Mr. Jones?  Yeah.  Do you know why it's like that?  Dude, they were huge.  I've never heard this song.  They're fucking huge.  Don't go talking too loud. 
[00:09:00]  You call to land the slide.  Mr. Jones.  You know, you go back to Saturday Night Fever.  There were 17 tracks.  There's only five tracks that aren't highlighted, meaning they weren't hits.  Really?  So 12 out of the 17 were played ad nauseum on the radio.  You had Stayin' Alive, How Deep Is Your Love, Night Fever, More Than A Woman.  This is a big one.  If I Could Have You.  This is a Beethoven.  This is the one where that fucking asshole jumps off the bridge, right? 
[00:09:30]  And John Travolta drives back to that chick's house in the car there, and they kind of,  you know, hook back up and kind of, you know, establish what their relationship really is.  Which is what?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Figure that shit out.  I don't know.  She's like, fuck it?  Well, you know.  I don't know.  And then it continues.  Night, Disco Mountain, Jive Talkin', You Should Be Dancing. 
[00:10:00]  Jesus.  Hey, man, what?  You think they made some money off this album?  A couple of bucks.  Probably.  How deep is your love?  How deep is your love, get it?  Talk about a pussy.  I don't like this as much as the other ones.  This is a good song, but, yeah, yeah.  Well, now we're getting a run away.  You gotta get the real good disco-y ones.  You need a chick for this one.  Like, fucking, man.  It's a good song to eat ass to. 
[00:10:30]  Go Jive Talkin'.  Which one is this?  Oh, yeah.  Which one is this?  Jive Talkin'.  It is, right?  Okay.  It's huge.  I haven't listened to these songs in far.  Jive Talkin'.  Oh, yeah.  This is probably be fucking number one on iTunes today.  Oh, yeah.  Huge.  Maybe it won't be.  Oh, my God.  All these songs will do well today.  It's so weird.  People need to go buy shit after someone dies.  Oh, yeah.  It's so weird.  Jive Talkin'.  You're Jive Talkin'. 
[00:11:00]  It all reminds me of the Boogie Nights scene where he's dancing and describing his fucking,  you know, it's real Italian.  Oh, hilarious.  When fucking, when Dirk Diggler and, what's his name, his fucking buddy there.  Yeah.  When they're doing the dance, they're smacking their hands together and doing that fucking  dance.  Best scene in the movie right there.  John C. Reilly is so good in this.  He's fucking hilarious.  John C. Reilly is so underrated.  Yeah.  I mean, we all know him, but he should be way bigger than he is. 
[00:11:30]  He is in so many fucking hilarious fucking movies.  In Boogie Nights, when Dirk comes up to the bar in the backyard the first time he meets  him, he goes, who do you want, a margarita?  And then he opens the blender up and he starts pouring the tequila and he goes, two, four,  whatever.  Right.  It's fucking hilarious.  What do you bench?  But that showed what teenage guys they fought like. 
[00:12:00]  It was so well written, that movie.  It was great.  The more I see that movie, the more I like it.  Dude, it's a fucking bastard.  Boogie Nights is a masterpiece.  Absolutely.  Fucking fantastic.  I know it's a great comedy because you're mentioning John C. Reilly was on over the weekend.  Step Brothers is the go-to movie.  Yeah, I got to see that one.  It's on every other week now on TV.  Yeah, yeah.  The scene where they're sleepwalking and they beat the shit out of their, quote, father.  Yeah.  While he's trying to sleep and they throw the Christmas tree down the stairs and then they  throw him down the stairs.  I've never seen that movie. 
[00:12:30]  Step Brothers?  Yeah.  I hated Step Brothers when I first saw it.  I'm like, what is this fucking nonsense?  The more you watch it, that fucking movie is hilarious.  But anyway, it's not about John C. Reilly.  E-Rock, where's You Should Be Dancing?  What was the number one on this?  What was the song on this?  It had to be just Night Fever or Stayin' Alive.  Yeah.  But if you remember...  You Should Be Dancing was up there, too.  You Should Be Dancing.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of people mistake with the movie. 
[00:13:00]  They think it was like Stayin' Alive or Night Fever, where John Travolta did his big dance.  It was this song.  But it was this.  Right.  And that's when he cleared the dance floor.  It's like, oh, look out.  Look out.  He's coming on.  And then he's just socking everyone's dick on the dance floor.  They're socking and fucking.  Down at 2001, the disco.  He's swinging massage linens over his head.  I won't be draped. 
[00:13:30]  That's great.  I won't be draped.  I don't want to be draped.  Hey, I want to know...  You know, guys send me flowers afterwards.  Maybe they thought you was dead.  You know, fucking Dice doesn't get Travolta.  We'll get Dice doing Travolta today.  Dude, I'm dying to know his take on this, because he idolized Travolta for real.  Yeah, yeah.  He loved John Travolta.  So, give the word to Dice.  We need him to do some Bee Gees today.  Look at Travolta.  We're watching the clip from Saturday Night Fever of Travolta doing his dance. 
[00:14:00]  That's hilarious.  Was this good dancing even?  I don't even know.  Yeah, for disco dancing, this is great.  At the time, people loved it.  Really?  He was the greatest.  Hey, he's the greatest out there, Father.  Wow, what excitement and energy, the dumb brother.  How does a straight guy move his hips like pain?  Oh, exactly.  He's so gay.  You learn that pushing your hips back.  Yeah, he can dance his ass off, Travolta, man.  Tin it, tin it, tin it, tin it, tin it, tin it. 
[00:14:30]  Staying alive is even bigger than this.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  The sequel?  Please.  Hey, I want to know where this album ranks of all time.  Can we find that out?  Where does Saturday Night Fever of the soundtrack rate as the album rank?  I'm going to guess second or third rate after my bodyguard.  The bodyguard passed it.  The bodyguard was the album that finally passed it years later, obviously.  Fifteen years later or something like that.  Wasn't there only one big song off there?  Was it Whitney's song? 
[00:15:00]  Bodyguard?  Oh, my God, no.  What else was on there besides...  I don't know that shit, to be honest with you, but I know there was a few hits.  The big song is, you know...  I, I, I...  I will always love you.  Yep.  What else?  There were a couple.  What do you got?  I'm Every Woman was the big hit.  I'm Every Woman.  I hate that one.  Terrible.  I hated Whitney Houston's songs.  I don't know.  I don't really know that shit.  What?  Run to you.  I don't know that one.  But where's...  Brian Adams?  Nice. 
[00:15:30]  What?  Where's the Saturday Night Fever school track, as far as ranking goes?  Yeah.  Yeah, I want to know the top five selling albums of all time.  What's number one?  Is it Billboard, top 100, all time?  You go Billboard.  Let's go Billboard.  Someone give me a top five list.  Pronto.  Pronto.  You should be dancing.  So what kind of cancer did Ronald Gibb have? 
[00:16:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  Was it Lung?  It probably wouldn't have lasted that long.  It was Lung.  Is this the top albums of all time?  What happened?  These top albums?  That's what it says.  But it has Dirty Dancing as...  Well, you got Thriller.  Above.  All right.  Thriller number one, Dark Side of the Moon by Floyd.  You got back...  Fucking ACDC, man.  Yep.  Yeah.  They just sort of go unnoticed in that world. 
[00:16:30]  Under the radar, but it's huge, yeah.  But, I mean, you're talking the third selling, most selling album of all time, Back in Black.  Dude.  I didn't realize Dark Side of the Moon was number two.  I can't believe that.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Dark Side of the Moon was one of those albums that never left the charts.  It came out in 1973.  It never left the charts for like 80 straight years or something like that.  Amazing.  80 straight years, yeah.  The Bodyguard is number four.  Fucking Stupid Meatloaf, Bad Outta Hell is five, Eagles' Greatest Hits, Dirty Dancing, 
[00:17:00]  and then finally Saturday Night Fever.  So let's move down the charts over the years.  Meatloaf has this.  Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  Bad Outta Hell was a huge fucking album in the late 70s.  All these albums, of course.  Then you've got Rumors, nine, and then surprisingly, Shania Twain is in the top ten albums of all time?  That album was ridiculous.  But the Beatles aren't.  The Beatles have none of the top ten albums.  Yeah, that's kind of weird.  They're the biggest selling band of all time. 
[00:17:30]  Kind of weird.  Why is that?  I'm guessing because their Greatest Hits was one of the biggest albums.  Well, Sgt. Pepper, finally, or Pepper's 13, I guess.  That's the first Beatles album.  Elton, though, Led Zeppelin.  You're looking, they're not even in the top ten.  Zeppelin IV was a monster album, and that was 11th of all time.  Jagged Little Pill almost beats out Zeppelin by Alanis Morissette.  Yeah, how come the Beatles have a couple down here?  But they have, like, let me see, one, two.  They only have two in the top 20. 
[00:18:00]  Madonna?  Where's Madonna?  Madonna's down on the list there.  Where's the Madonna?  Top 20 for Madonna?  Yeah.  30 mil.  And then the Bee Gees have another album.  What is that?  Spirits of Having Flown?  I have no fucking idea what that is.  Holy mother of God.  But it's up there on the list.  Those Bee Gees.  What year did that come out?  1979.  79?  So what is that?  Their follow-up?  I guess.  To the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack?  Well, what was on there? 
[00:18:30]  What was on that one?  Let's take a look-see.  Everyone's focusing on...  Right, Saturday Night Fever.  Oh, Tragedy.  Tragedy was...  My stupid voice just got high.  I thought Tragedy was on the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack.  No.  Holy fuck.  That's on the follow-up, huh?  Too Much Heaven, Don't Know It, Love You Inside Out, Don't Know It.  That's a big song, too, right?  No, Tragedy was huge.  This was a big one.  And Spirits Having Flown.  I don't know these songs, man.  I know Tragedy.  This is awful.  Man.  What's the name of this album? 
[00:19:00]  All right.  Spirits Having Flown.  This is so fucking 70s, Jesus.  How do you get your voice like that?  I can't do it since I have my cough and everything.  Is that the falsetto thing?  My voice is better, but the falsetto's gone.  Who's doing this?  Was this Maurice or Robin?  I think Maurice was big on this one.  No, this was actually Jerry Gibb.  Jerry?  Yeah, he was the one that you never saw on the record because he had a cleft palate.  But he had the best voice. 
[00:19:30]  They just kept him hidden?  Yeah, yeah.  He would always stand behind them in the pictures.  That palate would embarrass everybody.  Oh, my God.  Here it comes.  I think after the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack, all of their songs got very parody-like of  them, where it was all that high kind of thing.  They had a lot of shit before that, though.  Yeah.  God damn, Whitney's daughter looks all fucked up and shit. 
[00:20:00]  Was she fucked up and shit on the Billboard?  She's a gap-toothed motherfucker, ain't she?  She talked on the Billboard Music Awards.  I watched that thing for about a half hour.  It was boring.  Dude, holy shit.  The hosts were from Modern Family, right?  Holy crap.  It was the worst hosting job I've ever seen on TV.  Yeah, that little...  Worse than Anne Hathaway and James Franco?  That was pretty bad.  Yeah.  Wow.  They could have been worse, yes.  Yes.  They were horrendous.  They had no business even being there. 
[00:20:30]  Billboard is a fucking young show.  And they had a nerd and a woman that had no idea about any of the artists.  A nerd?  Not that I know much about him, but I think I know more, at least.  You watched that thing?  A little bit.  I was hearing there.  What's wrong, Ian?  I don't know.  I was just watching some guy kissing fucking...  Oh, Will Smith, he slapped him, too.  Will Smith slapped this guy.  Oh, yeah.  He fucking slapped his...  He was like enough already.  Hey, man.  He slapped some backslaps.  Get away from me, motherfucker.  Oh, yeah.  He gave me a little backslap.  That's the slap they're talking about? 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  That's nothing.  They're talking about that like it was a huge slap.  He took the back of his hand and basically brushed him off.  Brushed him like, get the fuck away from me.  Who was that guy?  Oh, then...  Some guy that does that.  Like, he's like a celebrity prankster or something in that country.  Asshole.  He's like one of those guys.  Overseas, that happened.  But they made it sound like it was a big fucking deal and a big slap.  The media sucks.  Yeah.  And then I bought into him.  I'm like, holy fuck, Will Smith just bitch slaps him, dude.  Bitch slap.  That was just kind of a brush off.  Yeah, that was more like enough already, dude. 
[00:21:30]  But after that, Will Smith goes, dude tried to kiss me on my mouth.  He goes, that's all good.  It's all good.  Then he came back to Will Smith.  But for a second...  He was angry, Will Smith.  For a second, you go, oh, that's right.  He's a fucking Philly dude.  Right?  Yes.  That's the...  Motherfucker.  You forget because he's the Fresh Prince and he's a funny...  You know, hey, you're off today.  It's Saturday.  Oh, the girls are trouble.  You forget like, oh, yeah.  And it's the famous joke.  You can't take the Philly out of...  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  You know, he always has a piece of that Philly in him. 
[00:22:00]  And he even had to change the lyrics of Girls of the World.  Because there was a funny line where he goes, you hit it with a trash can and run like hell.  And they changed that as he got bigger.  Oh, really?  Yes.  They softened it to something else.  Oh, man.  I drove through West Philly where Will Smith's from.  Holy fuck.  It's awful, right?  Holy fuck.  You've got to give this guy all the credit in the world.  I don't know how you fucking get out of that.  Holy fuck.  But watch it.  Play the volume of it.  You can watch his face.  This is the real Will Smith guy.  Come back to the beginning, Sam, or I'll just give you a kiss. 
[00:22:30]  I guess he is a reporter.  Man, what the hell is your problem, buddy?  All right.  Oh, that was a little...  Hey, sorry.  It looks harder from that angle.  I'm joking.  You're lucky I ain't sucker punch him.  Sorry.  I said that on camera.  Yeah, good for you, though.  Yeah, no, no.  It's all good.  Hey, what's up, man?  Is that it?  Hey, what's up?  It's all good.  Well, good for you, though.  He wanted to sucker punch him.  Of course he did.  Like that fucking head and just...  Kiss me on my mouth.  And just knew, like, he probably wouldn't...  That's getting in your space. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  I don't blame Will Smith for that at all.  Oh, you should have fucking decked the guy.  Can I try to kiss him on the mouth?  I hate this guy.  I hate people that get in your space.  The close talkers and all.  Like, how do you not know you're in someone's space?  It's awful.  It's awful.  Everyone just knows that rain just stays...  You know what I mean?  Get away.  Fuck.  Speaking of Will Smith, he decided to sing The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.  What?  Yeah?  On Graham Norton's show in England.  He's huge.  Graham Norton...  Is massively huge.  He followed us after Tough Crowd got taken over. 
[00:23:30]  I think they put Graham...  I think they did Tough Crowd with him once.  Really?  Yeah.  He's massively huge.  He would come over once in a while.  Comedy Central was trying to push him.  Graham Norton gets people on his show that you don't get on American talk shows.  Like, he'll get...  The ones you do get, but he'll also get Dustin Hoffman.  He'll get De Niro.  All those guys, they do his show, and this guy, Jonathan...  Something.  He's a really good interviewer.  Can you look him up?  Jonathan, whatever.  Talk show England.  Jonathan.  He's massive in England.  I actually know who you're talking about, but I can't think of him. 
[00:24:00]  He's a very good interviewer.  They get De Niro?  Well, that must be a treat.  Yeah, it's probably...  But I'll tell you they do a better job.  Graham Norton's show, when you look at the set, it looks like a fucking...  I saw one episode where he had Ozzy and Ricky Gervais at the same...  Yeah, how great is that?  It's a colorful set.  Like old school...  Jonathan Ross.  It just looks like a fucking fun place.  Like, look at Graham Norton's set.  It just looks like a fun place to be.  What, an American TV doesn't look fun?  It doesn't.  Something about Graham Norton's show just looks like a great place. 
[00:24:30]  It's got oranges and pinks.  Oh, yeah, look at that.  It's a really, really cool set, and please, Sam, you're finding the wrong place.  Oh, Sam.  Oh, wow.  Look at that set.  It just looks...  That's a little too obnoxious.  Is that Madonna?  That orange color is a little too obnoxious.  Madge.  But he gets called Madge.  Is she talking with that accent of hers?  Let's hear it.  Obviously, you can remember, you know, when you weren't Madonna.  She could fucking...  No.  Her English accent.  The persona of Madonna.  Can you remember...  She looks really good right there.  ...what I felt like to not be the focus of every movie you walk into. 
[00:25:00]  Recently, too, huh?  All that sort of stuff.  Mm-hmm.  I do, and I really enjoy when I'm in environments where I feel anonymous.  That's pretty American.  Yeah, she ain't fucking around.  She looks good there, you're right.  That's stupid English accent.  How old is that?  It's recent.  Wow.  She's 50-something there, 50...  She looks good, man.  How old is she now?  50...  I want to say 52, 53, probably.  Yeah, she don't look too bad there.  He's a great interviewer, actually, and so is Jonathan.  I don't know what these guys...  They're completely relaxed around the biggest celebrities in the world. 
[00:25:30]  Completely.  With that said, Will Smith sang the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air song on the Graham Norton show.  Damn.  Okay, hit the track.  All right.  Okay.  Okay.  Whoa.  It's going all the night out of my life, just whipped and upside down.  And I'd like to take the finish and sit right there, and then you all became the Prince of Bel-Air song right there.  Whoa.  Whoa. 
[00:26:00]  In West Philadelphia, born and raised, on the playground of grass, stand-ups in my game.  Chilling out, maxing, relaxing, or fooling, or shooting some divar.  I thought I was going to go with a couple of guys who were up to no ground.  It's a big noise, too.  Yeah, they don't know it.  I got a one-minute party, my mom got to get in and see if you're a big guy, you're not going to get in.  I'm listening to a cab, but we're the game, there's a nice amazing person.  If anything, I'd be in this cab was rare, but I thought, now I'll begin it. 
[00:26:30]  Yo, it's a bad.  I pulled up to the house about 7-0, and I yelled, did it carry on.  Say you later, looked at my kingdom, I was finally there.  Let's see it on my throne, and that's the Prince of Bel-Air.  Damn.  That's pretty fucking cool, man.  That's a massive audience.  That's a 500-person audience.  And they all know the words?  Yeah, that's pretty crazy.  They all know the words there.  That's kind of a cool song, though.  It's old school.  I haven't thought about it in years, but it's very catchy. 
[00:27:00]  It's old school.  Did we talk last week about the Carson documentary that was on PBS?  I fucking didn't see it yet.  Dude, I went online to watch it at 5 o'clock in the morning, going into Sunday morning.  I'm like, ah, I couldn't.  I had to watch the whole thing.  Was it great?  Awesome.  Fuck.  On PBS.com or whatever.  Is it a new one?  Yeah.  It's brand new.  Oh, you didn't see it?  It's brand new.  Yeah, they were promoting it.  It's American Masters, and it's about Johnny.  And there's, dude, there's home footage of him from, like, the fucking 40s and the 30s.  Wow.  And they talk about how awful his mother was and how she would never give him a compliment. 
[00:27:30]  It's an awesome documentary.  I gotta check it out.  Hell yeah.  I like that shit.  It was great.  We lost this guy on the phone, but he said they wrote the soundtrack to Saturday Night Fever  in two weeks.  Is that possible?  I am.  Is that the folklore on that damn thing?  I don't know.  I think they had some of those songs in the back of their heads, though.  Probably.  I said, oh, all right.  We can maybe use this one.  It's a perfect opportunity to throw this out.  I don't know.  Maybe not.  Night Fever.  What a coincidence.  I asked about Whitney Houston's daughter on the Billboard Music Awards last night, and 
[00:28:00]  we got the quick clip.  She's talking about her mommy here.  Oh.  They're doing some fucking reality show, I guess.  Huh?  Yeah.  You want a reality show?  Yeah, yeah.  I think so.  Good luck to you.  I just want to say...  I just really want to say thank you to everyone who supported us through it all.  Not just from when it was good, but when it was bad, to just everything. 
[00:28:30]  Thank you so much for showing that much love.  Because she deserved it.  It was good.  I'm just, uh...  I'm just blessed to have been in such an incredible woman's life.  There will never be another one.  Ever.  And I thank you.  All of you.  The fans, everyone.  Thank you.  So much.  But you could say the same thing about your plumber, you know?  We're all... 
[00:29:00]  Never.  We're pretty unique, you know?  Every single person is unique.  Some people...  I hate when they say that shit.  There'll never be another.  Well, no.  No, of course not.  Of course not.  And I won't.  Right.  Did she look fucked up or anything?  I thought so.  They just showed the clip on TV.  She looked a little glazy.  A little glazed over?  I thought so, but I don't know.  A little woozy.  There's been rumors.  She didn't really come off as fucked up.  She just looked like she was Bobby Brown's kid.  How old is she?  She looked glazy.  She's 18, 19, something like that. 
[00:29:30]  Something like that.  No, you know what dumb fucking band I'm starting to really get into?  They were on that dumb stage a couple times.  LMFAO.  I told you from the beginning.  I know their songs, but they're goddamn catchy.  Are they the party band?  Yeah.  I said from the beginning how great they are.  Well, I don't know.  They're not going to have a long run in the music industry.  But their singles are fantastic.  I'm sexy and I know it.  What was the other one, though?  I'm sexy and I know it.  Are they popular parties? 
[00:30:00]  Oh, God.  He has parties in there.  These guys are fucking huge.  The other one was the one before this.  That was number one for six weeks.  That's quite an accomplishment.  Especially in this day and age.  Yeah, these guys are good.  Are you kidding?  No.  I just like the sound.  Yeah, it's good club music.  What was the other one?  This was it.  Oh, he already did them.  That's so good. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  All right.  We get it.  All right, already.  Oh, shit.  Did you hear that?  Running through these hoes like Drano.  Running through these hoes like Drano.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's good.  That's very insensitive.  Can we get a couple clips of how bad the hoes were?  I was obsessing about that last night.  They were horrendous. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, this one.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  This is the hook.  Great.  You cranked this at the compound.  Oh, yeah.  At 2.30 in the morning while the neighbors are trying to sleep.  Yes.  Shake that.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, that's kind of cool.  All right.  You can fade out.  That was a perfect fade out.  Jesus. 
[00:31:30]  Well, every day I'm shuffling, you got to sneak it in.  That's a lie.  What?  Every day I'm shuffling.  You got to sneak that in?  Like cards?  I apologize, anyway.  I'm stupid.  No, you're not.  Yeah, I am.  I'm really stupid.  I don't think so.  I'm very stupid.  I disagree.  I'm stupid and I know it.  The Rich Voss song.  Let's do that.  It just came to me.  Let's do it.  And we can use Voss clips.  Can we do this?  Oh, yeah.  I can do the part.  Yeah.  I can actually do that very easily for Troy Kwan.  I'm stupid and I know it. 
[00:32:00]  Let's do this.  There's something else I want to fucking say.  Oh, Battleship was a bust.  Bomb, huh?  A bomb-a-roo.  It looked like it was just going to be terrible.  They were hoping...  Oh, and it makes me very happy.  And I know we have nothing to do with the numbers.  I'm not going to be cocky about it.  But that stupid Sacha Baron Cohen who blew us off.  We used to fucking have him on our show. 
[00:32:30]  The dictator is a fucking disaster.  Is $17 million bad for that?  Fuck, yeah.  Because it goes down from here.  Bomb.  It came in third place over the weekend.  And Battleship did $25 million, which is not good.  They wanted a lot more from that movie.  How much did it cost him to make?  Do you know the...  Because comedies aren't usually that expensive.  I'm sure he'll make his money in the end.  But I think he wanted better numbers than that.  Did anybody see The Dictator over the weekend?  Was it good?  Anyone on staff? 
[00:33:00]  No.  No?  And then The Avengers, $55 more million.  That thing is a juggernaut.  Three weeks in and they're still making $55 million a week.  Crazy, right?  Fuck.  Yeah.  What did that Battleship do?  $25.  $25?  Not good.  That's a bad opening weekend?  Fuck yeah.  The action movie?  Fuck yeah.  It's terrible.  They were hoping for $100, I bet you.  At least Sacha Baron Cohen is a comedy knocker.  You know how mad you must be when you have an action movie and The Avengers is still fucking...  They had to realize The Avengers was going to destroy them, though. 
[00:33:30]  Still?  Yeah, definitely.  What's the total up to with The Avengers?  International?  I think they're up to like $80 million.  They didn't open in the U.S. today.  What?  It's like $10, $20 million?  They opened in Europe first.  Why'd they do that?  I don't know.  I think they wanted to test the numbers because John Connor did so bad that they read...  What's John Connor?  Exactly.  It was supposed to...  John Carter.  Carter, sorry.  Oh, yeah.  Connor.  We were all supposed to know what John Carter was, but it was a bust.  What was it?  I don't even know.  It was this big, huge budget Disney movie that did like... 
[00:34:00]  They lost hundreds of millions of dollars on it.  Yeah, that's the new big bomb.  Yeah.  John Carter?  Yeah.  Was it a...  That's supposed to be like a almost Lord of the Rings-ish, but also...  The name is terrible.  Star Wars-ish.  From what I've heard...  It's an old book.  The story is like that a Civil War era person goes into a cave and ends up on Mars  in the future.  Oh, God.  How is that not a hit?  Comedy?  Boo.  Wow.  That's crazy.  Yeah.  It just did so badly.  I'd rather watch wrestling. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  And that Disney logo just ruins...  You can't say Disney presents because you're just going to be like...  Yeah.  You think goody two-shoes.  Yes.  Yes.  It doesn't matter how much violence or action.  It's a Disney movie.  Yeah.  They should have another company that's associated...  A subsidiary.  A subsidiary of Disney.  Yeah.  A subsidiary of Disney movie.  It's a Marvel movie, though.  But it's Marvel.  Yeah.  But you see Marvel.  Yeah.  And you go, oh, Marvel.  I know Marvel.  This is going to be good. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, there's a guy in the movie.  Is it a comedy?  No.  No.  Why is he...  He's talking to a Martian, but why does he have to be from the Civil War?  It could be anybody from this era would be freaked out, too.  And why do Martians have to have so many arms?  Because the Civil War guy is kind of fucked up.  He doesn't know about this shit.  But the Martian has four arms.  What, was there an atmosphere on Mars back during the Civil War?  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  Oh, God.  This is horrendous.  By the way, Game of Thrones last night?  Wow.  Really?  Oh.  It's good.  It's good.  I love Game of Thrones. 
[00:35:30]  No spoilers.  Don't worry.  I won't give you any.  No, I saw it.  Oh, you did?  Okay.  But I found last night's episode a little lackluster compared to the rest of them.  I like some of the, you know, reveals and little things like that.  But, yeah.  The end reveal is great.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Even though I kind of saw that coming.  I kind of saw that coming, too.  Definitely.  But, yeah, they're gearing up is what it is.  I guess up to the last two episodes are coming up.  And that's going to be some wicked shit.  Are they over the next two weeks?  Yeah.  Now, let me ask you, without giving any spoilers. 
[00:36:00]  There was one reveal where the dwarf had to talk about a woman.  Yeah.  Do you think he set that whole thing up to make it look like she was someone she wasn't?  I think so.  I think so, too.  Yes.  All right.  I think so.  He's great, man.  He's fine.  Because you don't think.  The thing about him that's so good is you think, like, you know he's a dwarf, but he  really is just like any other character in the show.  He transcends his dwarfdom.  It's not like they make fun of him in there and call him, you know, a little imp and  stuff like that. 
[00:36:30]  But he just comes across as a cool fucking character.  Yeah.  He's womanizing.  He's fucking drinking.  He's a little duplicitous little douchebag like the rest of them.  And he really is an ass.  And that King Joffie is the most hateable character.  He might be the most hateable character ever.  That little fucking prick.  Bob Kelly was funny.  Bob Kelly said, if I met him in real life, I'd fucking punch him in the face.  Yeah, he really is horrid.  I hate him.  Like, I want to see him beheaded so badly. 
[00:37:00]  Yes.  I think he'll get his comeuppance eventually.  How's the sex scene?  There was a little bit of sex last night between, well.  Was there any?  Yeah, yeah.  There was.  That nurse woman.  Oh.  Yeah.  What an ass on her.  I know.  I know.  Holy shit, right?  Oh, that was a romantic scene.  That was very romantic for that show.  She's kind of one of the more attractive women.  And the show is great because they just, the realism of it, because, even though it's a  fantasy setting.  But you know chicks wouldn't be that hot back then. 
[00:37:30]  There's that one, you know, the fucking.  The mother of dragons is hot.  Yeah, yeah.  She's hot.  But then all the rest of them are just these kind of average, filthy women.  Well, because you know they had a lot of fat in their diet back then.  They weren't worried about skim milk and all that shit.  Yeah.  They ate the entire animal.  They weren't cutting the fat and the grizzle off it.  Did you see that when they gave Joffrey the first birthday?  He just posed those whores.  Oh, just to punish them?  Oh, my God, is he terrible.  I wish they would have showed the results. 
[00:38:00]  I know, yeah.  But he's a sadistic.  Yeah, yeah.  You can't not hate this kid's...  I'd love to interview him and see what he's like, because he's probably the most pleasant  one on the set.  Yeah, probably all nice and everything.  But what a fucking piece of shit character that King Joffrey is.  He really comes off like a douche.  You want to see...  I want to see his fucking head roll off his shoulders.  I want to see him very frightened and suffering before they actually kill him.  Well, they showed coming attractions for the next one.  Yeah.  And he was talking about when they fight, I'll give him a red smile from ear to ear.  And you know he's just a little cunt with a sword. 
[00:38:30]  That was funny, man.  And it's like, oh, I'm sure he's...  Very frightened.  Very frightened.  But they show the coming attractions for next week.  And then you can see that he's frightened.  He goes, there's a lot of...  There's so many of them.  Yeah.  This will be good.  I fucking...  I fucking...  Dude, it's a great show.  I'm bummed.  I can't talk about this show.  It's so good, dude.  I want to watch this.  Just go back and...  And that's the beauty of On Demand.  I know.  I got to just start.  You can fucking rip through them before next week.  You can be caught up.  I know.  That's the thing.  You got to get in now.  I'm going to start today.  You'll love it, dude.  Yeah.  Especially when you see the end of season one, what they do. 
[00:39:00]  It's like...  This is what I've learned about HBO.  At the end of every season, especially at season two, somebody's going.  Oh, boy, are they.  Like fucking Boardwalk Empire.  Have you watched that?  No.  That's what I got.  And I couldn't believe the end of season two if they did.  I couldn't...  I'm like, what are you doing?  That's the HBO formula.  God damn.  It really is good.  But they can always bring them back and make believe it was a dream sequence or something.  Yeah, like Dallas did with Bobby.  Well, they fucking killed the husband off in that cancer show that I watch every once 
[00:39:30]  in a while.  Then they brought him back and said, oh, no, it was just a heart attack, and they were  able to bring him back to life.  But the whole in-between season thing, you thought the guy was dead.  It was an amazing ending.  You don't watch that show, though, huh?  She has the cancer, and they talk about her like she's at the end of her life, and he's  running a race, and the...  What's it called?  The Big C.  I don't know.  Oh, no.  I thought it was about me.  My wife watches, so I'll check it out here and there.  And all of a sudden, he's running a race, and she's got the cancer, and you don't know 
[00:40:00]  how long she's got to live.  And next thing you know, he drops dead, and that's how the season ended.  He's like, holy fuck.  That's a holy fuck and amazing moment.  You wait the, what is it, six months, four months in between seasons, and next thing  you know, oh, no, he's okay.  He just had a massive heart attack.  Is it HBO?  Showtime, right?  Oh.  Is it Showtime?  Showtime.  Yeah.  It's a pretty good show.  Whatever.  But if you guys didn't see it, it's like...  No, I haven't heard of it.  But it goes to your point, that sometimes they commit to these amazing fucking endings 
[00:40:30]  to a season, but then they can't fucking go with it for the next season.  They've got to figure out a way out of it.  Yeah.  They pull it to your heart strength.  I don't know.  HBO kills you dead.  I like HBO.  But HBO is all in.  I guess that's the difference.  Showtime decided, no way we can't, this character cannot be dead after all.  I've always thought HBO stuff was so much more realistic than Showtime.  It's so much better, yeah.  Showtime's caricature is real.  I think I've said that before, but they take...  And they're good shows, but like Dexter, the serial killer, but he only kills other killers. 
[00:41:00]  Like, or Californication.  And I asked to come to this on purpose.  It's a good show, but it's about a sex addict who really just bangs hot chicks.  And it's like, and I asked him about his character, and he goes, well, he's very passive.  He kind of allows it to come to him.  And my experience in this act is far different than just banging hot chicks who like me because I'm an author.  And what else?  Like, Homeland.  Good show.  Claire Danes is a great thing.  She won an Emmy.  She was phenomenal.  But of course, it's about the terrorist who's an American soldier who got turned into a terrorist. 
[00:41:30]  You know, every issue...  And they did that way back from fucking Cell, where they had like a terrorist cell.  But it was a white, a black, and they kind of pieced it all up.  A nice mix of people.  You know, like fucking William H. Macy.  Shame?  Yeah, that's not...  I'm not going to say it's a bad show, but it's kind of like a caricature of a...  They seem to take away kind of realistic things and cartoon them a bit.  Shame, not so much, I would have to say. 
[00:42:00]  Some of the scenes he gets involved with are pretty fucking rough.  Yeah, I haven't seen that.  Pretty fucking rough, man.  I probably don't know what I've heard of it.  Not as bad is what I'm saying, but I understand your point, certainly.  Did everyone see Kristen Wiig leave SNL?  No.  I didn't watch SNL at all.  It's on one of our TVs, right?  Oh, let's go with that.  Nicky Iger sings, She's a Rainbow to her.  Oh.  Pretty good moment, though.  She's getting all emotional.  And the fans are coming out.  Have you seen a lady vendor? 
[00:42:30]  She comes in colors everywhere.  She owns her hair.  She's like a rainbow.  Oh, la, la.  She's like a rainbow.  Coming colors everywhere.  She comes everywhere.  She comes in colors everywhere.  Lauren Michaels comes out to dance with her bone, I guess. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  How many years is she on?  I don't know.  They do about what?  Between five and eight usually, right?  Yeah, I think she was seven.  Seven years?  But I think, if I remember correctly, when she first started, I was still kind of watching SNL a lot.  They barely used her.  She came out of nowhere, man.  Well, she was Dr. Pat on Yoshmo.  That's all she had done for this.  No, I know.  We know that.  Oh, my God.  That's right.  That's right.  Was Amy Poehler SNL?  Yes, she was, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Amy Poehler came back just to help. 
[00:43:30]  And there's a lot of people came back.  The big finale.  A lot of them came back for this Kristen Wiig thing.  And the season finale.  Steve Martin's back there.  Steve Martin is.  Was he back there?  Yeah.  I don't know why.  And then there was a thing with, what's his name?  Sadakis?  Sadakis?  Jason.  Jason.  Sadakis?  Sadakis?  I don't even know his name.  Look, they're highlighting him in the background.  He's pissed.  Why?  Well, because he's leaving the show, too.  And they didn't really do anything.  Oh, man.  That's hilarious.  Look, they're highlighting him.  He's so fucking, he's losing his shit in the background. 
[00:44:00]  He's really sad.  And then they said he stopped dancing and clapping because it was like very festive at  the end of the show.  And then by the end, he wasn't even on the stage anymore.  He's like, fuck you.  I'm leaving, too.  Why don't I get a big send-off?  I guess there's like three or four leaving.  But they focused on Christine Wig.  Wow.  Funny.  Has she been that longer than him?  I mean, his new season was 2005.  She's had more of an impact.  Yeah.  She's had a, yeah.  She's been like.  She's funny, man.  She's very funny.  That brides me.  This is a great fucking movie.  I like Christine Wig a lot.  She's going to be a huge movie star. 
[00:44:30]  And the last two or three seasons, she's been definitely like the key person on the  show.  Right.  They pump out some real like people that go nowhere, but they pump out some fucking massively  famous people.  Some of those people, I don't know if you were here, we were just talking about Sherry  O'Terry.  She was massive on SNL.  Oh, man.  And was a big bust after that.  Just gone.  One of the biggest busts ever because she was, her and Will Ferrell were in every skit for  years.  The weirdest.  Yeah.  And then, yeah, she went off to make movies and nothing for her. 
[00:45:00]  I wonder what happened.  I mean, nothing.  Who was the one that did?  And I saw this in the theater.  She went nowhere either.  Not Sherry O'Terry.  Molly Shannon.  Molly Shannon.  Like they, all of a sudden, what point do they realize?  Oh, fuck.  Like, oh no.  Oh, no.  Like I've jumped off the fucking, I've jumped off the ship and there's no life for  I have to get back.  Yeah.  But, I mean, their schedule, they have to jump off the ship eventually.  I mean.  Sure.  Any article or book you read about SNL, it's a, it's a fucking, it's a tough schedule.  Like, Daryl Hammond has no movie career, but at least he has a stand-up career. 
[00:45:30]  Right, yeah.  And he, he's done enough prestigious gigs.  Right.  Well, yeah.  I think he'll be okay.  Yeah, yeah, Daryl will be okay.  Molly Shannon was hilarious, but very quirky.  I don't know how that works in Hollywood.  Yeah, that's true.  As far as, like, starring in a movie, she could get, she could get, you know, a job here,  here and there easily, but.  Jason Sudeik is actually, he was a writer before Kristen Wiig started.  Right.  And then her first season, he was a featured player and became a full-time cast member the  season after her. 
[00:46:00]  Wow.  So they've been there the same amount of time.  So no one cares that he's leaving, though?  I don't know.  Lauren Michaels, I guess, you know, wanted to highlight that she was leaving.  And everyone, I guess everyone knows he's leaving, too.  And he was just like, what the fuck?  Seriously?  What the fuck is this?  This is how it ends.  Mick Jagger's singing to her.  Mick Jagger's singing to her.  And he's standing here like a dolt.  And he's trying to clap in the background like a dummy.  And he finally said, you know what?  I can't handle this.  Yeah.  Dunscape.  She whispered something to him when they were dancing together.  Yeah.  I don't know what it was.  She was probably something like, don't worry, this is for both of us, really. 
[00:46:30]  It really is.  Yeah.  Well, I'm going to do movies.  What are you going to do?  Oh, God.  He'll be fine, too, I think.  Yeah, he's been in a lot of stuff.  Yeah, I don't know.  Oh, fuck yeah.  He's been in a shitload of shit.  Who else is leaving?  The other dude.  Parnell.  Chris Parnell.  I think he's leaving.  They're going to have to do a big...  I think there's at least...  Right?  I think it's those three.  So...  Why don't you go out there and just be on SNL?  Boom.  Fucking just tell jokes every week.  And Chip. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, God.  Chip Chipperson.  Chip Chipperson.  Chip is the only movie that made less than Mrs. Pat.  Pat.  Andy Samberg.  Oh, he's the one leaving?  They're rumored to be leaving the show.  Oh, wow.  Well, because Lawrence said, why don't you shut your fucking mouth?  Because it's not about you tonight.  Andy Samberg is going to go nowhere.  Really?  Did you see the trailer for the new Adam Sandler movie?  Yep.  How the fuck does this guy get to continue to make blockbusters? 
[00:47:30]  This is going to be his seventh movie in a row that sucks.  Just a bomb.  Did you see that?  I did not.  Just a bomb.  This looks terrible.  This comes out in a week, maybe two weeks.  Yeah.  The concept is that Adam Sandler got seduced by his teacher when he was very young, and  the teacher got pregnant and had this kid.  But then, you know, Adam Sandler's just a little kid, so I guess she gives up the kid  for adoption. 
[00:48:00]  Fast forward years later, Adam Sandler is still a kid at heart, and the kid he had with the  teacher is like, you know, kind of put together okay.  Is it Andy Samberg?  Yeah, so they have to fucking deal with this weird relationship, where Adam Sandler's actually  the kid, not the kid.  Oh, no.  Damn.  There it is.  Another great idea.  I hope I didn't explain that properly.  Everyone has a teenage crush.  God damn, she's sexy. 
[00:48:30]  Real sexy, hot teacher.  Donnie's...  Donnie's what?  Went a little too far.  All right, everybody.  The fact that this has resulted in a pregnancy leaves me no choice but to levy the maximum  penalty.  Take care of her baby, Donnie!  Dumbass.  30 years later.  So what'd the IRS say?  You haven't paid taxes since 94, Donnie.  I'm gonna go to prison if I don't get 43 large.  Holy cow, that's my boy.  He moved out when he turned 18. 
[00:49:00]  I haven't seen him since.  He's one of the youngest hedge fund managers in the financial industry.  Maybe your son can help you.  This follows me.  We're in love!  Donnie, what are you doing here?  What type of guy would miss his son's wedding?  You were basically the worst parent ever.  I was awesome!  You let me eat cake and lollipops for breakfast every day.  That's what you asked for.  You're supposed to say no.  You're supposed to say no.  I didn't know what I was doing.  I was 13, 14 years old.  You know what I remember?  It was me having to drive you home because you were too drunk.  Somebody's hammered. 
[00:49:30]  They'd have another guy drive home.  I was eight.  You drove like a champ, too.  Huh?  Oh, the stopping the music thing and a song.  You know me a little bit.  You guys have fun at the bachelor party.  This is going to be awesome!  Don't forget, you're going to go to prison on Tuesday.  You've got to get that money.  Actually, he's trying to be a dad right now.  He reminds me of Pacino in his last five movies.  I can't even take my shirt off in front of other people. 
[00:50:00]  What did I do with his dad?  Let me jog your memory.  You're a kid.  You're a kid.  You're a boy.  Their hands are all warped out.  Yeah, it's because I got it when I was in third grade.  My body grew.  You suck.  Oh, God.  Catch the boy!  Ever since you showed up, Todd's been acting like a different person.  I'll bet they helped each other a little in the end.  I bet.  Please don't.  We haven't seen this movie yet, huh?  They taught each other.  You know what, though? 
[00:50:30]  You are a kid!  I bet he helps the kid kind of get a little bit more fun, and he helps his dad grow up a little.  Right.  You big vagina, do it!  Oh, on a rope!  I didn't laugh once.  It'll make a lot of money, though.  Only thing is, I'm worried that he will grow close to his father and then find out his father just wanted the money, and then they'll fall apart.  But then the dad will come back just for the relationship.  Well, you know.  I hope so, Sam.  I really hope so.  From your lips to God's ears, there's hope. 
[00:51:00]  On his own, he comes back and goes, you know what?  Fuck, I did get the money, and I could fucking move on, but I gotta go back now.  And then he did something good with the money.  Oh, Jesus.  And how many chances did Andy Samberg get to star in movies?  Has he been in other movies?  He was in Hot Rod.  Yeah, they were bomb.  He came in for Hot Rod.  Yeah, it's a bomb.  Terrible.  What else has he been in?  I don't know what it is for.  Look him up for you.  We're probably going to be asked to have Andy Samberg for this movie, you know that.  Of course.  Yeah.  And he's got to be like, oh, it's funny. 
[00:51:30]  It's great.  He was in Hot Rod.  I remember that.  Yeah.  What else?  He's in a Justin Timberlake, Mila Kunis movie, The Bombed.  He was in the Meatballs movie.  Was it called Where's My Girlfriend's Ass?  Ass is awful.  Terrible ass.  Bugs short and flat.  Yes.  The rest of it was amazing.  There's rumors she did a little ass transplant.  Yes.  I think they put some fat in there.  They kind of tried to pump that ass up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was in Nick and Nora.  That bombed.  Yeah. 
[00:52:00]  To bomb.  Yeah.  Every movie's in bombs.  Nick and Nora.  I never heard of that.  Exactly.  Hot Rod.  Hot Rod.  Hot Rod was good, right, Sam?  No.  Nobody saw it.  Nobody knows for sure.  I thought, you're right.  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  I'm stupid and I know it.  All right.  We should take a break.  Good evening.  Hi, this is Penn Jillette.  Hey, this is Tony Clifton.  Hey, this is Russell Peters.  Hi, this is Pat Cooper.  And you're listening to the one and only Opie and Anthony.  We're so sorry, Uncle Albert. 
[00:52:30]  We're so sorry if we caused you anything.  We're so sorry.  Uncle Albert.  This weird song.  Yeah.  Pull my headphones off so it doesn't blow my fucking ears out.  It's one of those songs.  We're so sorry, Uncle Albert.  Who is this?  Who are you? 
[00:53:00]  Paul McCartney.  We're so sorry.  It's like three songs in one.  Yeah.  Paul McCartney was known for that.  The Beatles were known for that.  They would just have unfinished songs and go, you know what?  Let's just fucking make it into one.  Yeah.  Oh, is that why those songs sometimes sound like?  We're so sorry.  Yeah, then this song completely changes.  Right.  I want to hear that part now.  Because then it goes to the pile. 
[00:53:30]  So far, it's a good song.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't need E-Rock today.  This is what, 41 years ago?  Oh, good.  Paul McCartney released Ram.  You're not playing the sounder?  I don't know.  Good.  What is Ram?  No offense to E-Rock.  It blows my ears out. 
[00:54:00]  Uncle Albert.  Bloody thing all day.  I don't know what Ram is.  Is that a Wings album?  Oh, yeah.  Or, yeah, right?  This song stinks.  It's not bad.  It was a big hit.  Was it?  Yeah.  It's awful.  Who did that voice?  It was probably Paul McCartney.  You think it was him doing that part?  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah. 
[00:54:30]  We want to hear when it gets all goofy and shit.  Yeah, we want to hear that part today.  It's like it's Monday.  We don't give a fuck.  Keep playing it.  We've got Marc Maron coming in today, 8 o'clock.  Yes.  And then the Dice Man at 9 o'clock.  Yeah.  Back to the song.  I haven't seen him in a while.  Turn this up.  This is the part of it.  Oh, this is the same song?  Yeah.  It's a pumpkin pie.  Right?  Butter pie.  Oh, butter pie?  Butter pie.  That's always pumpkin pie.  Yeah, it's butter pie.  That's when the pie has a really nice body, but not a good face. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, shit.  Now it feels like this was a song he was working on right here, right?  Yeah.  This sounds more wings-ish.  Yeah. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, I always thought that's pumpkin pie.  No.  You think this was shit he was working on for maybe some Beatles songs?  I don't know.  He could whip up the songs pretty quick, this guy.  Well, it's 41 years ago.  Beatles, what, made it to 69-ish?  70, right?  Yeah.  So, I don't know.  Maybe that was in his repertoire.  Maybe.  Maybe he was ready to present this shit to the band and say, hey, let's make something  out of this.  Yeah.  I don't know.  And then, you know, they broke up, apparently. 
[00:56:00]  You want to hear the Billboard host?  I got a clip.  Yeah.  So, the Billboard Music Awards are on, and they just have to get, you know, two people  that are really hot in pop culture to host the damn thing.  Yeah.  They don't even ask these people, you know, could you even host anything?  Can you host?  And make it seem natural between you two?  Do you have charisma?  Well, they certainly did not.  No.  They're married on Modern Family, but in real life, holy fuck.  Most people are, like, really writing the dialogue and everything?  Yeah.  Well, they probably were.  Yeah, but you think if you're that, you know, if you're in a hit show, you got something 
[00:56:30]  going on where you can maybe...  Cut some chops.  Yeah, some chops, and you can wing some shit.  Hmm.  This is them announcing the Biebs.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  This is so cool, Ty.  This is so cool.  Wow.  What is wrong with your arm?  Oh, I just got inoculated for Bieber fever.  Is it working?  No, I'm burning up.  It's like an adorable bird blue.  Why? 
[00:57:00]  I think we just got to the chase.  Yes, apparently there's a lot of people here who are very excited to see Mr. Justine.  Yes, Mr. Justine.  Uncomfortable, right?  Especially that one question, which would only be funny if you asked it to Bob Dole.  That's what I'm talking about.  Good topical reference.  I don't know.  Well, what was this?  And they're doing skits together?  The skits were horrendous.  Oh, it looks hilarious.  They're on a massively successful show, too. 
[00:57:30]  Bomb.  And some pumpkin pie.  I want to hear David Lee Roth.  Oh, you want to hear the David Lee Roth?  Sure, we can do that.  Van Halen swears they aren't fighting.  They just need some time off.  David Lee Roth.  Travis brought me a two-minute clip.  Now, this clip you're about to hear, we could have played five seconds of it.  Oh.  But it shows you the beauty of David Lee Roth.  He's a bit wordy. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  So he takes about two minutes to say that the band is tired.  Tired?  All right.  So they're canceling sold-out shows because they're tired.  I don't think so.  There's no fucking way.  If you're tired, you take a week off.  You could cure tired in a week.  Right.  Maybe two.  Let's call it two weeks.  You don't cancel the whole tour.  No.  Unless there's an illness where his voice is not holding up.  Maybe they're not fighting. 
[00:58:30]  Maybe it's Eddie's cancer or some weird shit.  Oh, they're fighting, I bet.  Yeah, maybe.  Yeah, I mean, most of us would assume they're just fighting and don't get along because  you don't say goodbye to sold-out shows.  That's a lot of fucking money, man.  Yeah.  A lot of fucking money.  No one leaves that type of money on the table.  You might sacrifice a couple dates, a couple weeks of a tour maybe to get your shit back  together, but not the whole tour.  They're postponing it, so they might, they're going to probably go into therapy or something  and try to figure this shit out.  Yeah.  But here's David Lee Roth.  David Lee here.  We're in the woods just now. 
[00:59:00]  David Lee here.  David Lee here.  We're in the woods.  What the fuck is with that affected voice thing he does?  David Lee here.  Everything has to be over the top important with this guy.  What's he doing?  Why is he in the woods?  Where?  Where?  That's kind of him, though.  That is him.  Is it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Crazy.  David Lee here.  We're in the woods just north of Minneapolis, St. Paul, and we're going to be firing up 
[00:59:30]  the tour bus and driving into town to do another super-sized show in just a little bit here.  And we're going to be going strong all the way up until July 4th.  The band is getting along famously, better than we have in quite some time.  And I think the shows reveal that through the miracle of YouTube.  I think we're one of the few bands who relishes you bringing whatever camera.  If you can carry it in and pull the trigger on it yourself, then please do. 
[01:00:00]  And through the eye of YouTube, you can see that we're having ourselves a hell of a time.  And I think that translates into the music.  As usual, we bit off way more than we could chew when it came to scheduling.  The band is winning, but our schedule has been sidelined for unnecessary roughness.  If we continue past July 4th and all the way into Australia and Japan, then we're asking  for the robot zombie tour when you start getting a lot of yes questions.  Do you feel all right?  Yes. 
[01:00:30]  Are you having a good time?  You don't want to get to that point.  And we're nowhere near that point, but we're going to take a break.  And we're going to come all the way back around because this tour, this tour is going to take  us about two years.  And we're the guys who brought you cool in the gang is the ultimate, inarguably left-handed  top bill co-headline tour.  They just went on first every night.  And we have in mind a supersized monster truck rally, Van Halen tractor pull sort of event. 
[01:01:00]  And we're going to be bringing that back around for the United States as soon as we learn  to speak Australian.  So stay tuned, and we'll see you down the road in just a little bit.  It's weird he would make that video, to be honest with you, but I just don't get blown  off sold-out shows.  I don't understand that part of it.  And how come he wasn't with Eddie giving that little speech there?  That would have carried a lot more weight.  And he's always been his own guy, so he's probably like, well, fuck that. 
[01:01:30]  They probably fucking watch that, and Eddie's like, this fucking asshole.  Now I've got to make a fucking video.  What a douchebag.  Guaranteed.  I don't know.  It's weird, but it is David Lee Roth.  Yeah.  I don't know.  He's saying they're coming back.  All right.  Plausible deniability.  Fair enough.  He's got it.  How long of a break have they taken?  They're not really saying.  And the fact remains that they have sold-out shows they're canceling.  That's crazy to me.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a bit much. 
[01:02:00]  That's insane.  Unless something's going on medically with one of them that they don't want to say.  It could be, but...  It could be Eddie's thing, or it could be Roth's.  Maybe his voice is fucking...  Maybe he has nodes on his throat or something, and doctors say, you've got to get these off.  Well, here's a guy who was at the show Saturday.  Scott, where did Van Halen play Saturday?  St. Paul, Minnesota.  Oh, okay.  So, yeah.  All right.  Fair enough.  So, how were they?  The band was phenomenal.  Eddie was phenomenal.  Alex was great.  Even the bassist was all right, but his voice is tired. 
[01:02:30]  He's sad.  So, when Eddie and his son there sound better than he does, it's pretty bad.  Hmm.  You don't...  Well, but David Lee Roth kind of talks his way through a lot of songs, so...  Yeah.  He's trying, these days, real hard to really sound like...  Almost like Sammy Hagar, get like...  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So, he might be killing his voice.  Well, can we get a clip from Saturday's show?  I'm sure it's up on YouTube somewhere.  We can see how David Lee Roth sounds. 
[01:03:00]  Well, you thought they sounded great.  I mean, I would love to go see Van Halen.  As much as we make fun of David Lee Roth.  Oh, I'd love to.  I would love to go.  I didn't see him at the Garden.  I gave the tickets to a fan.  I had just seen them at Cafe Waugh, but they were great, man.  It was really fun to watch them.  What are you, fucking Mr. Charitable?  Yeah, but I didn't want to wait so there were tickets from David Lee Roth.  Oh.  I heard it, Sam. 
[01:03:30]  Unchained. 
[01:04:00]  Right on.  Fuck you all.  Where's Jay Morse?  Where's Jay Morse?  David Lee Roth has fun on stage.  Oh, he does.  That's hard to hear his vocals, buddy. 
[01:04:30]  I mean, they look like they're getting along.  Yeah, he has a ball on stage.  They look like they're getting along.  It looks like David Lee Roth's having a good time.  But they can do that.  They could look like, you know, they're getting along.  So, truth of the matter is, they've been known to hate each other.  How many shows did they cancel?  Like, couldn't they finish up this leg and then take a break?  Or was there too many?  I don't know.  Do we know, Sam?  Can we look at that?  We went through this thing last week, and we knew there were absolutely a bunch that were 
[01:05:00]  sold out that they're canceling now.  So, I'm not sure of the exact number.  They're canceling 31 shows?  See, that's crazy.  No, man.  That's crazy.  Something's going on.  Yeah, that's not just we're tired.  We're a bit more than we can chew.  You could get a lot of sleep in a week or two. 
[01:05:30]  You know, you cancel and you go in the woods or go to the Caribbean or something and just  chill the fuck out.  You can get yourself back together fast.  Unless it's medical.  They're canceling 31 shows.  Something's up.  I'm sorry.  And now they're saying they're postponing.  Yeah.  Well, they've pretty much said that from day one.  And the dates are going to be rescheduled.  Uh-huh.  All right.  Not canceled.  31 postponed.  Yeah, because they don't want to lose those tickets.  31.  So, you don't say canceled because that means everyone gets their money back.  So, they're like, all right, let's slow down. 
[01:06:00]  Let's just say postponed because we could, you know, keep that money.  Yeah.  That's why I think it's a medical thing.  Because if they weren't getting along, they would finish the run and just end it.  I don't think, even if they weren't getting along.  Right.  I don't think they would cancel all that money mid-tour to just fly in separately and fucking  just shit it out.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  That's why I think something's wrong.  Yeah, the money.  You don't look at each other until you're on stage.  Yeah.  Because you have a definite number of dates.  It's like if they go, okay, we're done with each other September 8th or whatever it is.  Right.  Yeah, because the money men would sit you down. 
[01:06:30]  You do realize that you're blowing off $100 million because you don't get along with this  asshole.  Dave talks a lot.  Just finish.  Right.  Shut up.  Right.  Count them down.  Right.  25 more.  20 more.  We'll put walls up.  The audience won't even know that you can't even see each other.  Yeah.  We'll develop a stage.  It's either Roth's voice has nodes, Eddie's cancer is back, or the threat of it is back.  There's something medically happening.  That's my guess.  That's Jimmy's guess.  That's my guess. 
[01:07:00]  Why should it be something awful like Wolfgang's hair has been bothering him?  Something stupid where the hair on the top of his toes is itchy and he can't perform?  The Lockerbie guy is dead.  Yeah.  Lockerbie guy is dead.  I'm a guy.  Yeah.  I read something where one of the fathers of the victims thinks that he had nothing to  do with it.  There was a lot of people saying on his deathbed, he said, I'm going to meet my God or the week  before he died.  And he said, and I swear I had nothing to do with this.  Maybe he's trying to fool God.  I'm interested to know why people would think he didn't. 
[01:07:30]  I don't know enough about the reasons people said he didn't.  Yeah.  Well, he lasted three years after they got him out of prison.  All signs pointed to him, though.  There's a lot of evidence.  There was, right?  Yeah.  That was three years ago.  I know.  He got another three years.  He got three years of freedom.  Thanks to the shitty Scottish and British governments.  Yeah.  But the Lockerbie guy is dead.  But now he's got to, you know, face that final judgment.  But why do they say that he didn't do it, Sam?  Is there any evidence? 
[01:08:00]  Liar, liar.  It closes a chapter, but it doesn't close the book.  We know he wasn't the only person involved, one person says, who's the president of the  group of victims of Pan Am Flight 103.  Yeah.  I think the thing is that people don't believe he's the only person.  Well, he's dead now.  Fucking Gaddafi's dead.  Good.  No, but there were other people that thought he had nothing to do with it.  Nothing.  I'm just curious as to what, why.  I bet he's guilty of something.  Mm.  Yeah.  That's always my excuse when it's like, oh, you know, there's been an injustice done. 
[01:08:30]  It's like, bah, he probably did something.  The media's not covering Zimmerman's injuries as much as they covered the, uh.  Oh, no.  Because they're onto other shit.  They just can't.  As well.  They can't get enough of the fucking racial.  No, they want, they really want to, uh, pound that whole white guy killed a black  kid thing.  And it just isn't.  It isn't the case.  I was watching some lib crap on fucking MSNBC over the weekend.  And it's just infuriating.  Mm-hmm.  They're talking about Trayvon and how he's now being victimized. 
[01:09:00]  And, uh, calling him, like, the victim.  Yeah, he was killed.  But, you know, there's a difference between being a victim and being the person that was  killed in a self-defense, uh, shooting.  Alleged.  So we'll see what happens with that.  But, man, they showed the back of Zimmerman's head and it was fucking gashed open.  He had a busted nose, two black eyes, uh, and, uh, Trayvon had, uh, laceration on his  knuckle.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  It just, everything from the physical evidence totally went in line with what the witnesses 
[01:09:30]  has said.  And, you know, there were a bunch of witnesses that night that, of course, the news didn't  really pay attention to.  They saw a guy with a hoodie pounding.  Yeah.  And the original, the fathers originally heard the tape and said, no, that's not my kid yelling  for help.  Not my kid.  And one of the witnesses that was 30 feet away from the whole thing said, yeah, I came  out and a guy was on the ground.  A guy with a hood was over him, punching him in the face.  And the guy on the ground was yelling, help, help. 
[01:10:00]  And, uh, then he heard a shot.  And it's weird because they said that the ballistic evidence also shows that he was as close as  he said.  Like, yeah, it's, it's the type of encounter.  Or, yeah, it wasn't like he, he stood five feet away from him and shot him.  They were, they were having a physical altercation at the time.  And, uh, you know, it happens.  But, uh, and, and the whole thing with him getting out of the truck and following when  he was instructed not to, it doesn't even matter.  That shit doesn't matter, especially from what Zimmerman said that night. 
[01:10:30]  Uh, wasn't he walking when he made the call?  He was already out of the truck, wasn't he?  Yeah, out of the truck.  It really, this looks like an acquittal.  It looks like it's going to be an acquittal.  And, uh, they're saying that they might pressure him into some type of plea deal just to appease  the public.  And by the public, we mean, you know, black people that'll riot.  But what would the, what would the appeal be?  We'll give you two years.  You'll get to, uh, we'll give you five years.  You'll be out in two. 
[01:11:00]  We'll guarantee you solitary confinement or whatever.  And Dershowitz is saying, like, he should never take any deal.  This is an open and shut self-defense case that shouldn't even have been brought to, uh,  trial.  And, um, we'll, we'll see what happens here.  But, uh, the, the lawyer's job and the prosecution's job is not to appease the public.  It's to prosecute a case.  And, and the defendant's lawyer, his job is to defend his client, not defend the populace 
[01:11:30]  and, you know, the property of the people that might be damaged during a riot.  Uh, so, I don't think any deal should be, uh, cut.  I think this guy should go to trial, clear his fucking name, and that'll be that.  And, by the way, it said, uh, Al McGregor, he's, uh...  Lockerby.  Yeah, he's Lockerby guy.  His codependent was acquitted of all charges, and he insisted he had nothing to do with  the bombing.  And there was a lot of, the people that believed him got a boost in 07 when a three-year investigation  by the Scottish Tribunal found that new evidence and old evidence that was withheld from the 
[01:12:00]  trial suggested that Al McGregor may have suffered a miscarriage of justice.  And that's an 800-page report, and it prompted an appeal on Al McGregor's behalf.  But by then, his fate was in the hands of the politicians in London, Tripoli, and Edinburgh,  all of whom jockeyed for position as Libya rebuilt ties with Britain.  You know what I wonder?  Let's just say, for the sake of argument, that there was evidence that he didn't do it.  Maybe to avoid the embarrassment of the fact that, hey, we put an innocent guy in jail, 
[01:12:30]  maybe they figured out a way it appeases Libya, we get the oil deal with Libya,  we get this guy out on a medical leave, he's sick anyway, fuck him,  and this stuff that could come out could make us look like there really was a miscarriage.  And again, I'm guessing just by this.  Miscarriage of justice just falls out like cherry cobbler on the floor.  Terrible.  Yeah, how about a baby carriage or something?  No.  Sorry.  Sorry.  I just don't, because one of the fathers really believes, 
[01:13:00]  he said he cringes when everybody says a bomber died,  because he said he didn't think this guy had anything to do with his daughter's death,  or his son's death.  Well, sometimes some of those people go a little nuts when they kick him.  Oh, yeah.  I'm just curious as to what the evidence is.  Well, he's dead.  Yeah?  He's dead.  He's dead.  Hey, Facebook dude did something really smart over the weekend.  Oh, my God.  Ted Zuckerberg?  He's not an idiot.  Did you hear the latest?  No, why?  All the fucking divorce lawyers are saying he's fucking brilliant. 
[01:13:30]  Why?  He waited for the IPO.  So now the marital assets has nothing to do with the IPO.  Oh.  Zuckerberg got married over the weekend.  Can't be.  Friday the stock went public, and then he got married on Saturday.  They all thought they were going to a party,  because his now wife was graduating, I think, medical school.  So they thought they were going to a graduation party,  and it was a surprise wedding, and Zuckerberg got married. 
[01:14:00]  And they're saying, because he waited that day,  that that's not considered marital assets.  The billions that he just made.  Because it's an IPO.  Because of the billions he made.  His worth went up 24 hours before he got married.  You know what, though?  New York lawyers are saying it was a fucking great move on his board.  Probably, but you know what?  If she decides to leave, he's going to have to pay her a fuckload of money anyway.  Yeah, he's going to have to.  A long time.  Who knows?  But they're saying that might, will most likely help him a lot.  It just wouldn't matter to some Asian broad, eh? 
[01:14:30]  He's been with her since college, though.  I am.  And Bill Gates, all these guys, Steve,  these guys that become these massive fucking multi,  you know, we don't hear about them fucking a lot of girls.  Their focus is not on that.  They're just happy to get one.  Yeah.  So they want to keep her.  Yeah.  These guys are happy to get just one girl's attention.  Like, he's just happy his girlfriend is marrying him.  Yeah, yeah.  He's definitely happy that he's just with a girl.  Right.  And she's, you know, not a geeky looking thing.  She's all right.  No, she's cute.  Robert Murdoch has a really hot, younger Asian wife. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  And there's something about that with these.  I bet you the dominance of certain Asian women,  they can be kind of, yeah.  Really?  I thought they were, like, submissive.  I think they are.  But I think some of them can be very submissive.  Having a language barrier probably saves you a lot of arguments.  Yeah, that's true.  I don't understand what he's saying.  Right.  But didn't it not do as well as they thought it was going to do?  Yeah, but there was a snafu, they're saying, on Wall Street.  And I don't know. 
[01:15:30]  I'm a little behind on that story.  I just think people are scared of this.  But supposedly, also, people couldn't get their trades in  because there was something going on.  What the fuck?  Well, they had to halt trading for some reason.  Yeah.  If there was some kind of problem.  But we'll see what it does today.  It only went up 23 cents?  Yeah, at some point it was up, like, 40 to 40 bucks.  Someone must have bought it 40.  Oops.  44?  Yeah, 44.  So many people in thinking it's a Google situation, so.  I'm debating getting something.  Can you short that stock in?  No, I tried dabbling into some options, but not available yet. 
[01:16:00]  Didn't work out for you?  Oh, it didn't?  Oh, okay.  Not available yet.  Where do you think this thing's going to settle for a while?  I don't know.  At what price?  It's so hard to tell what anything's going to do right now.  It's at 38, 23, something like that right now?  It's at the fucking IPO price.  It's basically at the IPO price.  The problem they say with it, though, is that they can't make mobile money.  There's not a lot of ways to make money with Facebook, and that's the problem that they  have with it.  They don't have it.  Their mobile app fucking stinks.  It does, right?  It's the worst fucking app for something that big. 
[01:16:30]  It's terrible.  It freezes up on you.  It takes forever.  And we all got fan pages, right, at this point?  Yeah, I think so.  But I can't post to the fan page from my phone.  From Twitter?  You can't do it, yeah.  No, that's from my phone.  I have to go to my regular account, which is just a dummy account, basically.  It's just there, so I can do a fan page.  So I have to post to that, and then I have to fucking repost it when I get home.  Yeah, it stinks the way the fan pages are running. 
[01:17:00]  Why can't I fucking update my fan page from my phone?  Facebook is really confusing.  Is this too technical for people?  No.  Not at all.  They understand it.  It's a fucking pain in the ass.  There's too much gibberish on the screen.  Gibberish?  There's too much nonsense.  Oh, the calendar.  You got a big invite.  I don't want to go.  I don't want to go.  I want to be left alone.  Make my settings easier.  Yeah, exactly.  Fuck!  You know, we have a chance at a Triple Crown. 
[01:17:30]  Yes!  We have Force fans in this room.  I'll have another.  I'll have another.  That's right.  Won the Preakness.  Came from nowhere in the end.  Again, won by, as they call it, a neck.  A neck.  He won by a neck.  So now it sets up a nice chance at the Triple Crown at Belmont on June 9th.  Yes!  But the problem with Belmont, it's a longer race, right?  That's what makes it so hard to get the Triple Crown?  Yeah, that's the long one.  Because there's specialty horses that could run those longer races better.  Yes.  Very hard to get a horse that can run like a six or seven full-long race. 
[01:18:00]  And then you put them in a mile and a quarter, mile and a half.  What is the Belmont?  How far is it?  It's longer.  But, yeah, we need a horse fan.  How much longer is the Belmont than the Preakness and the Kentucky Derby?  Eight inches.  Eight fucking inches.  Damn it.  A lot longer when it comes to that.  Yeah.  But it's exciting.  We'll all be watching the Belmont because this is rare.  You get a chance at the Triple Crown.  When was the last?  It's a mile and a half.  All right. 
[01:18:30]  What's the other races?  Mile and a half?  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  What?  Help me out, somebody.  Who knows horse racing?  What's the Preakness?  It would be a great name for a horse.  Ted the Horse.  Ted the Horse.  No, it wouldn't.  That would just be such a great name.  Ted the Horse.  Ted the Horse.  Ted the Horse.  We need a horse expert.  I want to know the lengths of all the races of the three races that make up the Triple Crown.  Yeah, what the fuck?  How much longer is the Belmont?  Why ain't someone helping me?  They're slowly calling now. 
[01:19:00]  Are we on a delay?  Yeah.  How long?  It's probably about 20.  20 seconds or something?  Oh, that's not bad.  No, yeah.  I know the app is literally five minutes behind.  I will call the after show, and then I wait for an elevator, go all the way upstairs, put  my stuff down, and the show is on in my house, and I'll hear myself doing a phone call from  five, six, seven minutes ago off the app.  Why is it that much of a delay? 
[01:19:30]  Now there's just people writing the names of the races, and then distances with no correlation.  Mike, we got Belmont is a mile and a half, but what are the other, what's the Preakness,  and what is the Kentucky Derby?  Well, the problem is that the Kentucky Derby, a lot of the horses that were in the Kentucky  Derby sit out the Preakness, so they come back for the Belmont, so they don't have to  run the Preakness.  Why do they sit out the Preakness?  Because they don't have to run three races in five weeks, and you're not going to put  up the money to run in the Preakness.  Yeah, but don't you want a Triple Crown possibility?  Well, no, I mean, if you lose, I see what he's saying, if you lose the Kentucky Derby, 
[01:20:00]  then you're like, fuck that, we're not running the Preakness, but if you win the Kentucky Derby,  obviously you've got to run the Preakness, but I mean, I'll have another, it's not going  to be tired.  Mile and a quarter is the Kentucky Derby.  They don't run three races in five weeks.  They never do that.  They take time off.  It's very hard to do.  And those stupid horses have to stand all the time.  It's got to be murder.  You know, whoever invents the first horse hammock is going to be such a hero to horses. 
[01:20:30]  When do the horses lay down, Ant?  When they're sick.  That's about it.  When they have the colic.  They even sleep standing up all the time?  They never...  Not all the time.  I've seen horses that kind of, you know...  Chill out a little bit?  They kind of chill out on their legs.  They kind of fold their legs up and kind of sit there, but they rarely lay on their side  or anything.  Does that make their horse legs crampy?  It's all weird.  They're fucking legs that bend backwards and stuff.  I don't know.  But they...  Yeah, they kind of just lay down like that.  If they're laying on their side and shit, they're probably sick. 
[01:21:00]  Really?  Yeah.  I would just lay my horse down on the side and go, chill, man.  We're good.  The other two races are a mile and a quarter.  Mile and a quarter?  Yeah.  And Belmont's a mile and a half.  How many is this one?  One, two?  Yeah.  We're going to all watch to see if we get a triple crown.  What's the last one?  Belmont?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's the one coming out.  June 9th.  There hasn't been one in 34 years.  34 years?  And what was the horse?  I think it was Seattle Slew or Affirmed?  No, I wasn't. 
[01:21:30]  Why don't we ever know this?  This comes up.  I think it was Affirmed.  Who was Stevie Cawthon's horse?  Remember him?  Stevie Cawthon.  I don't know Stevie Cawthon.  I think that was...  He's a legendary jockey.  Of course.  He decided...  Affirmed?  He decided to ride overseas.  Remember that?  It was a big deal.  He fucking went overseas to ride.  A little jockey guy.  He was a little thing.  Why was he so popular?  And why is the Belmont so much longer?  Because they make it...  It has to be the hardest one.  Alidar. 
[01:22:00]  Alidar was the last triple crown?  No, I think that was his horse.  Secretariat, if you remember...  Secretariat was the last triple crown?  No.  We're all just throwing names out of horses.  How much did Secretariat win by?  A nose.  If you want about 20 lengths...  No, a long...  I'm joking.  He's a great horse.  So it was affirmed in 1978 it was the last triple crown winner.  Yeah.  That's 34 years ago.  34 years.  Wow.  And like you said earlier, excuse me.  Longest ever.  So, wow, this race is a quarter mile longer. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  Huh.  A lot can happen in that last quarter mile.  You're against fresher horses.  And fresher horses, because, yeah.  I'll have another standing somewhere getting tired.  Yeah.  It's a great fucking...  When you go down to the track live, you go down to Belmont and you stand right by the  rail, by the wire, and when they come fucking charging down there, it's the coolest sound.  It's just like thunder.  It's fucking great.  I got checked in.  It is a lot of fun.  I like going to the race.  I watched a race at the Derby when I was there last year. 
[01:23:00]  I didn't watch the...  Oh, the Derby.  The actual Derby, I didn't watch because I was in by the winner's circle to try to grab  a moment with the winner.  That's ironic.  I should have been by the winner's square.  I messed up.  But I had to speak to the winner to close out the Tonight Show bit, so I didn't get to  see the actual race.  I wish I did, though.  Yeah.  It is cool.  I like it.  A mile and three sixteenths.  Well, all right.  A mile and a quarter, more or less.  A little less than a mile and a quarter. 
[01:23:30]  We don't need...  They should do all three back-to-back, like Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday.  Just get them finished.  Horses' fucking legs are busted.  Yeah.  The Derby.  Last Triple Crown was 76.  Oh, we'll stop at 78.  It was 78, right?  Yeah.  We got that at least?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bell's Palsy.  Bill's Palsy would be a great name for it.  Bill's Palsy.  People do have some plucked-up names for horses, though.  Hoof-hearted was a good one.  Hoof-hearted.  Hoof-hearted.  Hoof-hearted. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  Didn't we have an O&A-themed name for a horse?  Yeah.  Some guy had a horse and had some kind of O&A-themed name.  I guess.  I guess.  We've been named after everything at this point.  Yeah.  I can't remember what it was, though, but somebody had it.  Yeah.  You hear about the teacher telling students not to talk bad about Obama?  I heard about this.  I haven't heard the audio.  I haven't heard it either.  I hear it's really good.  There's definitely a chance that Obama could be fucking unseated here in November.  You think?  Definitely a chance.  I'm not saying it will happen, but it's not as out of the realm of possibility as it seemed 
[01:24:30]  a few months back.  I'll be honest.  I'm hoping Obama wins.  For one reason.  Why?  And don't go back to Hannity with this shit.  Or make it perfectly clear.  Because it's great for this radio show.  Really?  It's the only fuck...  Yes.  To hear you lose your mind is great.  You don't think it would be great, though?  I don't give a fuck about the country.  I just care about the stupid radio show.  Oh, my God.  So, for that reason, I want Obama to win.  Because you'll literally pull your hair out. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, no.  No.  Not four more years.  No.  Because, you know, Rush Limbaugh, man.  I think...  You know how great...  Rush Limbaugh wants Obama.  Yeah, but I think...  I guarantee...  We've said this, I know.  But if you sit Rush Limbaugh down at a bar, or pop pills with a fat fuck, he will admit  to you that it's great for his business, and he wants Obama to be re-elected.  I'm sorry.  It doesn't...  It's not what he believes in.  I mean, you know, politically, he believes completely the opposite.  But it's great for his business. 
[01:25:30]  If Obama is to be elected, I do hope the Republicans...  Will you leave the country yet?  No.  You're going to leave the country?  No.  But I do hope that the Republicans take over the House and the Senate.  And then...  Yeah, yeah.  And then nothing gets done for another four years.  Well, none of his shenanigans, anyway.  That's a terrific system.  I like when he tries to get his shenanigans through.  Which should be better for Wall Street?  Probably if Romney gets...  Oh, Romney all the way.  Romney.  That's obvious.  Romney will be better for the fucking economy.  Romney's better for us, as individuals. 
[01:26:00]  And on the whole, it'll just be better for the economy.  And you can say what you want.  Four years of fucking Obama, and the economy is still in the fucking shitter.  And then if you listen to Biden, it's because of the recession that Obama inherited.  You have four years to fucking deal with it.  Deal with it.  They all inherit shit.  Inherit.  Yeah, that's your job, is to inherit some shit and fix it.  And try to figure it out.  Try to figure it out.  They all inherit shit.  All of them.  God, enough.  You want to hear this, teacher?  Yes, I do. 
[01:26:30]  Was that a good setup?  I don't know.  Is there a teacher?  Teach a teacher.  Arguing with a student.  And the student, from what I've heard, sounds reasonable.  Like, she's saying something about Romney being a bully.  And he's like, well, wasn't Obama a bully?  And she's like, no.  And just being a dummy.  The teacher is just arguing very illogically, from what I hear.  Hey, when I was prepping for the show today, did I hear that Biden might not be in?  Or is that something I heard I misheard?  That is fucking...  What?  There's like a rumor?  No, you were prepping for the show? 
[01:27:00]  Oh.  See what I did there?  Very good.  All right.  But Biden...  Did I hear that right?  There's some...  There's some...  A bit of a buzz?  I think they always say that shit, though.  Yeah.  Around...  They think it's more just a dumb rumor or whatever?  Yeah, yeah.  I think it's to...  There's nothing solid on that?  No.  Okay.  No.  He's going to be the vice presidential candidate with Obama.  You think?  Yeah.  Definitely.  He has been an idiot.  You can't take a chance with a new guy unless it's a solid new guy. 
[01:27:30]  Now it's like if you throw a new guy in there, there's skeletons in the closet.  Right.  You know, at least we all know Biden's a fucking idiot.  I guess you're right.  You got to, at this point, just...  And he can't run...  He can't run again, so Biden can't really fuck up his next chance at running.  And I think Biden probably wants to be president in four years.  He's too old.  You know what?  How was Biden?  I don't know, though.  Four more years?  No way.  He runs.  Usually the vice president likes stepping in there. 
[01:28:00]  Well, of course.  I think then at that point, Hillary might as well give him a run.  How old was Ronald Reagan?  Say, Reagan was...  There's go-karts right outside our building.  I know.  I see that.  That looks pretty fun.  That's the news, huh?  They're doing go-kart racing.  They're doing go-kart races.  I wish they'd fucking drive out onto 48th and get hit by a car.  Shouldn't we be doing go-kart racing and they should be doing the news?  Yes.  This Fox News.  What's going on?  Yeah, we're talking Obama and they're fucking racing around in cool go-karts. 
[01:28:30]  We could be in those go-karts right now.  Oh, that guy just went through the hay bales.  This guy doesn't know what he's fucking doing.  Because they've got a shitty little track on the sidewalk.  That's pretty cool, though.  It's two hairpin turns and a couple of straights.  We drive right by there every day.  I'll be on Red Eye tonight, actually.  Oh, you are?  For anyone who's going to be home watching you later.  Very, very good.  A little Red Eye action.  Who are you on with, you know?  I do not know.  Who's the hottie in the leg chair?  I don't know.  Somebody's not interested.  Is the leg chair?  Yes, they call it the end chair.  The end chair.  Always a hot chick.  Leg chair. 
[01:29:00]  So why don't you do the leg chair one night?  Oh, Jimmy.  With shorts on.  That would be hilarious.  Oh, God.  With your ball bag hanging out.  That would be a great little bit.  Jimmy in the leg chair.  I guess they're really hinting that Rubio's got it, too.  Yeah.  That's what they're going with.  Meaning the VP for Romney, obviously.  Romney VP.  All right.  Here's the teacher talking to a student about Obama.  What about the fight of the day?  What's that say?  The fight of the day.  That Mitt Romney.  I don't even know what this kid's saying.  I'm not going to sit here and make believe I know. 
[01:29:30]  What country is this from?  I don't know.  What country is this from?  Does anyone know what he just said there?  Nope.  What about the fight of the day?  What's that say?  What about the fight of the day?  What about the fight of the day?  What about the fight of the day of the day?  What about the fight of the day?  What about the fight of the day of the day?  What the fuck?  Danny's helping me out here.  Danny, what nationality is this kid?  What is that guy?  Wait, let's all guess.  I'm going to go Asian.  Vietnamese, I'm sorry.  Oh, very good.  I'm going Asian with big teeth.  Ah, see. 
[01:30:00]  I'm going to burst all you guys' bubbles.  I don't know, because there's no...  It's not like they're on video.  Oh, yeah.  I was just talking.  But, no, he's asking...  I don't know if you...  During my transition from the office to the studio, I don't know if you covered it.  He's asking the teacher what the fact of the day is.  I guess she put a fact of the day on the board or whatever.  Oh, okay, good.  So she put the fact of the day that Romney was a bully or something like that.  They just said Romney's a bully?  Yeah, or he bullied.  He used to be a bully in high school.  All right, so they're going to discuss that, hopefully, properly.  What about the fact of the day?  What's that thing?  The fact of the day? 
[01:30:30]  That Mitt Romney...  Was that Obama a bully?  Was that Obama a bully going?  No, this was on the door the other day.  How people were bullying me, hailed me.  He and another guy...  My kid's not going to school.  I understand what she's saying.  I know, but my kid's not going to school.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, the audio gets better because she gets closer to the recording device.  Right.  But, yeah, dude, she doesn't sound...  Well, that's what you would assume.  So she's going to lean toward protecting Obama. 
[01:31:00]  My kid's not going to school.  Because she's black, by the way.  She sounds black, right?  That's what I'm saying.  Of course she is.  I'm with you.  Is it okay to say that, Jimmy?  I don't want to get in trouble.  I'm with you on this one.  And that's why she's protecting Obama.  She's going to protect Obama and not talk about this openly, right?  Fuck that.  No other reason.  I've got to homeschool my kids somehow.  That means I've got to get some homeschooling people to come to my house  because I ain't doing it.  He and another guy helped a guy down when they went to high school  and shaved the guy's teeth.  Yeah, but they only called it a prank. 
[01:31:30]  But didn't Obama bully somebody, though?  No, no.  I didn't see him.  He went into a high school and admitted to bullying this girl in high school.  I don't know, but didn't I tell you that we would not be doing the great,  talking about the great of the Babylonians?  But didn't I tell you that?  If you're going to try to run me.  Stop.  No.  Because that's no matter.  He's running for president.  Help me out, Danny.  My ears are...  Holy shit. 
[01:32:00]  My ears are...  This cunt is just yelling.  My ears are shocked.  Help me out here.  Ask this guy.  Yeah, she's basically saying that he's not going to let the student badmouth Obama  because he's the president.  Yeah.  So she can't...  That's not the reason.  She can't say why...  She can't explain to the student why it's different.  Right.  All she's going to say is, yeah, well, Obama's the president  and you're not going to talk about him like that.  But that's what the school...  But there's no bias in the schools, right?  This is what the schools are all about.  Enjoy. 
[01:32:30]  How could this bitch not get fired?  She should be fired.  She definitely should be.  He's running for president.  Obama is the president.  He is doing the respect that every other president is due.  Oh, you mean the white ones?  Sorry.  No, it isn't.  Yeah, it is.  Oh, could you pause a minute?  Oh, so he's due the respect that I'm sure this fucking piece of shit gave George Bush...  That comes up later.  That comes up later in class.  Oh, it does.  Oh, okay. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, it is.  If you're going to talk trash about one side,  you've got to talk trash about the other way.  I love the kid.  Why is the kid smarter than the teacher?  He's smarter than she is.  The kid is smarter.  That's a smart person right there.  Should discuss both sides, all of it, all angles.  And it's completely legit.  That should be...  That's real teaching.  And learning.  Yep.  No, darling.  Let me tell you something.  You got to realize, this man is wanting to be what Obama already is.  So who's the case?  There's no comparison.  But when Bush... 
[01:33:30]  If he wins?  If he wins?  Okay.  If he wins?  Okay.  If he wins?  Oh, yeah.  He'll get it.  Because you know why?  Oh, yeah.  He'll win.  He'll win.  Who will?  It's just, I'm saying, if you're going to call a crack about one side, they call one  to each side.  This is just kidding.  This is every time you've seen a crack have a little debate with me about Obama.  It's just...  And this is going to stop.  It's just a question. 
[01:34:00]  It's just disrespect.  That's disrespect.  You're disrespecting Romney.  You don't even know that.  How does this mean this man is a presidential candidate?  What does that have to do with anything?  She stinks this bitch.  She is the worst fucking thing in the schools.  She's fucking horrid.  And this could lead to the kid being disciplined.  You know what I mean?  Her racial bias is fucking oozing out of her as if fucking a Klan member was teaching a  fucking class. 
[01:34:30]  And she can't cover it up for shit.  No.  No.  She's so incredibly transparent.  And she can't.  Wow.  That's what the schools are.  He's just a man.  But Obama is no God.  He's still a man.  Let me tell you something.  Give it!  You will not disrespect the President of the United States in this classroom.  I'll say what I want.  Not about him.  You won't.  Wow.  Not about him.  You won't.  And meanwhile, the guy was just saying, didn't Obama bully somebody in school? 
[01:35:00]  And this dumb bitch didn't know it.  No, he didn't.  And then he's like, well, he admitted he did.  Well, it's different because he's a candidate and he's the president.  What does that have to do with anything?  You can have an open discussion about the president and what you like or dislike about  him.  He won't be disrespected in this class.  Oh, God.  I'm sure she stuck up in Bush the same way, though.  Oh, I'm sure she did.  You know what?  He's the president.  Respect him.  Mark Maron's here, so we should probably break.  We have more of this conversation between the student and the teacher, but I will not 
[01:35:30]  allow us to go into another topic when we come back.  I want to hear the rest of this.  All right.  So we'll do it with Mark Maron.  That's easy.  We can do that, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  He's going to be fucking a pisser with this one.  What?  Mark Maron?  He'll probably side with the fucking piece of shit that's on the tape.  No, I don't know.  Mark's a...  A liberal douche?  Yeah.  Yeah, but he's also very...  He's about arguing and stuff like that.  I don't think he wants one side. 
[01:36:00]  Mark likes to argue.  Wow, there was a lot of hate right there.  Mark's probably listening to you calling him a liberal douche.  Well, he's a liberal.  He's going to make you very uncomfortable now.  He's liberal, and every liberal I see is a douche, so it's not personal.  I will not be disrespected in this studio, though, because I do the show.  He's a guest on the show.  There's the difference.  There's the difference right there.  And the news is saying that they might replace Biden with Hillary.  I don't know.  No way.  I don't know how serious that could possibly be.  Hillary is so fucking done with politics. 
[01:36:30]  You think?  I'm pretty sure she's done.  She's growing her hair out, because you know...  She just wants to...  Yeah.  You know why she's growing her hair out, right?  Become a lipstick lesbian?  She wants to be a little more attractive to who knows who out there.  That's my theory.  Getting ready for some fun in her retirement.  Rowery, row, row, row, row, row, row.  Mark Maron next.  My aunt?  Okay, good.  Ashley Madison.  It's not just for men and women who are in sexless marriages, although there are plenty 
[01:37:00]  of you who are stuck like that.  It's for also people who want to try new things.  Like if you have certain fetishes or fantasies.  Let's say you've ever fantasized about banging a hot Latin chick.  Ashley Madison is for you.  Why?  Because you can find them there.  If your idea of eating Chinese is munching on a hairless Asian, Ashley Madison is for  you.  That's actually the copy they gave me to read.  How great is that?  If for some reason your wife won't let you do her in the ass and drop your load on her 
[01:37:30]  back, Ashley Madison is for you.  I like that because obviously there's a woman on Ashley Madison that will let you stick  it in her ass and then drop your load on her back.  Then again, if they really want to sell me on Ashley Madison, they should say, hey, you  want to do a girl in the ass and then drop it in her dumper?  Ashley Madison is for you.  But I'm sure that that girl exists there.  Why?  How about a girl who's half Asian, half Chinese?  I will let you do it in the ass and dump it on her back.  Ashley Madison is for you.  There's more than 13 million members and someone banging, I mean joining, every seven 
[01:38:00]  seconds.  Ashley Madison is the best president you can give your penis.  It's 100% secure.  It's completely anonymous and it's guaranteed.  This site, AshleyMadison.com, people thought was a joke when it first started, but it has  caught on and is massive.  And I love the fact that these guys do not back off.  So I completely support AshleyMadison.com because I want to do everything they list  here.  How about girls with meaty pussies? 
[01:38:30]  I want that in the copy because that's why I'm looking to meet a girl with a fat badge  who's in a sexless marriage who doesn't mind a man who loses his erections.  Why?  Because that's me.  My erections come and they go.  You never know.  They're like bad weather.  So I need a girl on Ashley Madison who's in a totally sexless marriage who won't need  me to be a good fuck in order to continue seeing me.  So if you don't mind a mediocre guy fucking, I'm your guy and I'll be on AshleyMadison.com.  I hope that was satisfactory. 
[01:39:00]  In studio, Mark Maron.  Yes.  I just went outside the studio to ask Mark Maron because I'm a fanboy of the podcast.  I appreciate that.  WTFpod.com, Mark Maron on Twitter, Mark with a C. And I was pointing out some of the episodes  I like.  Well, thanks, man.  I wrote you about Jimmy Kimmel.  The Jimmy Kimmel podcast was terrific. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  I went over there.  I never know what's going to happen, but he's a sweet guy.  He just kind of hung out and was honest about some shit.  Well, it was a great listen for me because he's a radio guy.  People forget that Jimmy Kimmel is a radio guy.  A real radio guy.  And he still has it in his soul.  Yeah.  Like driving around for different jobs, doing the shitty jobs, running pranks on GMs, getting  fired.  Yeah.  I didn't know any of that stuff.  Bosses that just hated him and didn't understand him.  Yeah.  Wow.  A lot of the same shit that we went through over the years. 
[01:40:00]  How much research do you do on a guy before you interviewed him?  Absolutely nothing.  I don't know anything about him.  Like there's no way like you want to get to like, I don't want to ask him about something.  I'm just hoping that after, you know, in about 45 minutes that something happens that's  real.  You know, I mean, you guys do this every day.  The last thing you want is to sit there and feed them their bio.  So they go like, oh yeah, that was good.  That was that time.  I remember that.  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  Thanks for reminding me of that.  I should call that guy.  You know, I don't, I don't do that.  I mean, I try not to miss, you know, landmark achievements. 
[01:40:30]  See, I don't want to finish an interview and go, oh fuck, you won an Oscar for best  person.  Yeah.  You know, so, uh, I try to hit that shit like, but most of the time I don't know the  guys at all.  And I just wait for something to happen.  I did Danny McBride.  I had no idea what the, what that guy was about, but usually if I just shut up and let  him talk, you know, in an hour, you're going to figure out what kind of person to get.  What did he give you?  Well, you know, he has, he's, he had a good story about working in a restaurant.  Yeah.  I know that sounds weird, but I mean, that's the shit.  That's well, he comes, you know, he comes to LA.  He's got nothing.  He's got a shitty job.  A girl breaks up with him. 
[01:41:00]  He ends up, you know, chasing down some guy with a golf club and realizes he doesn't know how to  funny guy that you, cause you want him to be that, uh, that powers guy.  You want to be the eastbound and down guy.  I kind of wanted that.  I'm like, I want him to be a dick, but he's just very polite, you know, happy.  Couldn't be happier to be successful.  Yeah.  Really appreciative.  I, you know, I told you the Michael Sarah one was great.  And the reason we've had Michael Sarah in studio, he's a tough fucking guy to talk to.  Who is he?  He's a guy from Juno and from Arrested Development.  The kid, the quiet kid. 
[01:41:30]  Well, I mean, what about, you know, it's weird.  I mean, I'm telling you that's, that's a compliment.  Cause that, that shows that, you know what the fuck you're doing.  Cause I, I wouldn't have been able to sit there with him for an hour.  Well, they're in my house, you know, I've made the appointment there.  You know, they, they, they're sitting in my garage.  I'm not after 20 minutes.  I'm like, this is fine.  I'm done.  You're downplaying.  I can't.  You're downplaying.  Cause he's the type of guy that it would be like pulling teeth.  It really would.  He's a talented guy.  Absolutely.  But his delivery is a little weird and you don't know what he's thinking.  You don't even know if he's enjoying himself.  Yeah.  Well that, that happened.  I think you can get more out of somebody though, because there's an intimacy in a one-on-one 
[01:42:00]  that you don't have in a room.  That's definitely true.  That's definitely true.  And you set up your garage.  What?  Well, you know, it's, it's cluttered.  It's full of shit.  Is it really?  You don't even have it like set up for, I got booms.  I mean, that was a big day.  That was a big day.  But is it nice?  No, it's, there's stacks of books everywhere.  It smells weird in there.  You can set up a lounge or anything like that and make it all nice and intimate?  No, I mean, it's just clutter.  You know, I mean, originally I organized it.  I put a table up.  I mean, you know, you guys, you know, Dice is coming in later. 
[01:42:30]  He came.  Yeah, that's, that's, it's a little better than that, but there's more shit in there.  And I took the bike out.  So, uh, you know, that there's places where you do your podcast.  That's hot as shit in there.  Cause you guys got Dice coming in later and he came over and the only thing I was  fucking worried about is it like in the summer, it gets hot as shit.  So I got a deal.  I had Andy Richter in there and then people start sweating like their beads just sweat.  And I'm sitting there going, this is getting bad, but I don't want to stop the conversation.  But I've had people drenched in there.  And when Dice came over, the only thing I was fucking worried about was that, you know, 
[01:43:00]  he would, you know, it would be too hot and he'd start, you know, complaining about  how hot it was.  Right.  That was the only fucking thing I was worried about.  He didn't say a word and he didn't start sweating.  So it was all right.  Who, uh, since the last time you were in it, who's been a really good one for you?  What?  I just.  What are your favorites?  Well, I, I'm so, I'm sort of a, you know, a fanboy guy with some guys who I, and I don't  know them any better than you know him, or I don't know him any better than anyone else  does.  Because he hasn't been a celebrity.  Like Norm Macdonald kind of blew me away.  And that was a great time.  Right.  Right.  It was surprising.  You know, you just see, there are people that come in and you, I'm sure you guys deal 
[01:43:30]  with all the time.  You're like, I don't even know if he can talk.  Right.  And then, you know, you start talking.  Oh my God, he's a person.  But you know, he's very, you know, self-reflective and everything.  Todd Glass, he was on, he came out of the closet.  That was interesting.  Did he come out on your podcast?  Yeah.  That was where he came out.  Okay.  Good for him.  He chose to do that.  It was kind of weird.  You know, I mean, I, I, he called me a few months before and he's like, uh, and he's  like, I, he leaves a message.  I'm like, I got to talk to you about something.  It's personal.  And then he hangs up.  I call him back.  He doesn't answer.  Oh man.  And then like, right. 
[01:44:00]  And then I call him back.  He's like, look, I, I think that you're the right guy.  I want to do this thing.  And I'm like, all right.  You know, we can tell you what he wanted to do.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He said, he said, he said, you want to do that.  And then I'm like, I don't know.  I'm what, what am I supposed to do?  I'm flattered that you want me to do it.  But so there was this whole negotiation about how we can handle this.  Then he, he wasn't, it took him a while to get his eggs in a row mentally and with  his partner and stuff.  So for months he was, it got to be this point where he was, he was telling me like he wasn't  trying, he's trying not to let me down.  Like I get these calls like a month would go by like, we're going to do it after the 
[01:44:30]  new year.  I'm ready.  It's going to happen.  And I'm like, it's on you, man.  So it happened and it was good.  But a lot of people thought it was a bit for a couple of weeks.  Well, he wouldn't admit that he was gay.  He was like, I'm, I can't, I couldn't even like, he couldn't say the word gay because  he doesn't see himself as a gay guy.  There was a differentation.  Like there was a certain type of gay guy he didn't want to be associated with in a way.  He's a guy's guy.  He doesn't want to be a, you know, swishy. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  Right.  He doesn't want to be lumped in.  It was pretty delicate.  It was kind of odd.  He doesn't want to be the type of gay man that I would receive oral sex from basically,  which is twinkish and kind of feminine and wearing a wig.  Did anybody, did anybody ever know show on you?  No.  Some, you know, sometimes people are late.  I'll tell you honestly, I'd completely forgotten that I scheduled Lisa Lampan.  And Ellie, when she showed up on my porch, I was literally ready to go somewhere else.  And then like, I see her walk up and I'm like, oh fuck, is that today?  And I had to act like, like, oh, it was nice to see you.  We're waiting for you. 
[01:45:30]  But no, no one's never.  She wondered why you had to turn the lights on and just let everything in.  Let me open up the shop here.  I didn't realize I had a business to do.  How was Lisa?  She was great.  You know, I mean, she was, you know, real nice.  People, I don't know.  I mean, you guys, you sit there and talk to people after, you know, I thought she was great.  But a lot of times when people leave and then you hear them on other things or you hear something about them, you're like, why the fuck weren't they like that with me?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, that's true.  Oh, you're never going to get over that.  Because there's some stuff I hear you get out of a guest and I'm like, fuck.  Yeah.  Like what? 
[01:46:00]  I'm trying to think of one.  Well, I guess the Michael Serra thing.  I didn't understand, you know, that he's from Canada, obviously, but moved to L.A. with his mom and left his father behind and all that shit.  I was like, fuck, why didn't we ask him that shit?  Yeah, well, you know, like I had Paul Poundstone on today, you know, and, you know, you sit there, you guys would have a better job.  Like, she's got that legal problem.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I mean, you know, she was accused of, you know, molestation.  Touching kids.  Right.  So, like, she's sitting in my garage and I know she can leave. 
[01:46:30]  We're not live.  There's no point for me to open the conversation with, you know, did you, you know, I mean, what really happened there?  So I got to talk for an hour and then you got to delicately handle it and, you know, see whether or not she's going to say anything about it.  Whereas I think in this situation, you could kind of push it a little harder to get there.  But, you know, she was like, I can't really talk about it.  I'm trying to do better.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Sometimes they can.  Sometimes a one-on-one is, again, I've done some one-on-ones.  I find people are more willing to talk in a one-on-one.  There's an intimacy there.  You just don't hear.  It's like a bunch of guys in the room, one on your left, and people are much more guarded here than they would be. 
[01:47:00]  And plus the reputation of the show is fucking heinous and they think that they're going to be attacked.  Well, they're either surrounded by dicks or tits.  I mean, something's going to come out.  There's going to be fluid involved.  And you're wondering, like, am I going to be able to get out of there without being filthy at all?  Yeah.  But, you know, I don't know.  What?  No, I was going to move on to something else, what I admire about you.  You've been known as a politics guy for a long fucking time.  Yeah.  And you have been able to move past that with your podcast.  What am I going to do?  I do not hear you do politics. 
[01:47:30]  Well, that's because, you know.  And people expect you to be the politic guy.  They used to.  Used to.  Yeah, but sometimes it's hard to get out of that.  No, it's not.  You know, in my mind, when I was at Air America, I was there for a reason.  And in my mind, I did my fucking time for those people.  Because, in a sense, you know, whether I'm liberal or progressive or whatever, it comes to a point where you're not going to please either side.  If you want to carry the water and you want to be the politics guy, especially on the left, you're going to say stuff and they're going to be like,  You didn't say enough. 
[01:48:00]  Right.  So there's no pleasing them.  And what happened with me is that I started to realize, like, okay, I'm angry about politics.  And I go a little deeper.  I'm like, no, I'm just fucking angry.  So, you know, so politics was this template through which I could push my bullshit through.  And I started to realize once I started the podcast that, hey, you know, everybody's just trying to get by.  Everyone's just trying to pass in their fucking life and try not to lose their shit.  So I can relate to that.  So I just speak directly to that.  My point is it's kind of brave, though, because.  But I am a liberal douchebag.  I want to make that clear.  I told you he was listening. 
[01:48:30]  I told you.  I told you he was listening.  I know you knew I was listening.  But the funny thing is, at least I'm a qualified douchebag.  You know, there's just douchebags.  But if I'm a liberal douchebag, I can live with that.  Because there's an argument to be made that there's just plain douchebags.  And I know who they are.  But my point is you were able to leave your comfort zone.  You know you're damn good at arguing politics and getting people fucking riled up.  And you went, I know I can do that, but I'm not going to do that anymore. 
[01:49:00]  And I think that's kind of brave.  Well, sometimes that's all it is.  If something affects me personally.  Like if I'm, like, you know, right now I had to get health insurance.  You know, I never had to get health insurance before.  I'm a grown person.  Right.  You know, I got coverage like Jim does to AFTR or whatever.  And we're fucking infants.  You know what I mean?  Like, I got union, right?  You get the thing in the mail.  You're like, okay, I guess I'm good.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden I'm on COBRA and I forget one payment.  And they're like, you're out.  And now I'm like a 48-year-old guy that thinks he has a brain tumor.  I'm not even fucking covered for it.  So I got to call up and I got to figure out how to get insurance.  So that shit bothers me. 
[01:49:30]  And there's part of me that thinks, like, why can't we just automatically have insurance and I wouldn't have to do this?  Because then there's the issue.  Have you ever bought fucking insurance?  That's pain in the ass, man.  But I don't even know what it covers.  You know, you don't know what kind of insurance.  Oh, you don't have the cancer insurance.  I hope it covers a lot.  Yeah, right.  That's all you do.  Well, in the end, it doesn't really cover anything.  Let's be honest with you.  But that's it.  They figure out a way every fucking time to get as much money out of you as possible.  So, like, you're not incorporated?  Yeah, I'm incorporated.  Because it's easier that way.  Don't you have some people that are looking after some of your finances?  No, I'm not that financially adept.  How much money do you think I'm making? 
[01:50:00]  I'm working out of my garage.  Yeah, there's a special of that union coverage I get for being a garage podcaster.  We had a guy.  It's like, here's three insurance companies.  This does this.  This does this.  This does that.  And pick one.  As an individual guy, I just went in.  I went with this Kaiser thing.  So now, like, I'm actually in a health coverage situation that if there was national health care,  it would look like Kaiser, which means that you sign up, you pay a certain amount a month,  and it's only $25 copay for fucking anything. 
[01:50:30]  But you don't get to pick your doctor, and it's sort of a crapshoot when you get over there, apparently.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah, you just walk in, and I'm like, I'm sick.  Let me see if there's a guy here.  And then you go see that guy, and I haven't even gotten over there yet.  I'm hoping nothing goes wrong, but I do want to get the brain examined.  And what, you really think you might have an issue?  Yeah, I got a pain behind my ear, and yesterday my right eye wouldn't focus.  That's bad, right?  Oh, that's good.  Right now, I get these tension headaches, and I'm afraid, because I eat 20 pieces of nicotine gum a day.  I drink two pots of coffee.  It might be that. 
[01:51:00]  You think so?  Maybe you just give yourself tension headaches.  You're still getting a lot of nicotine through the gum.  I couldn't fucking sleep last night, and I haven't had trouble sleeping.  And I'm in a nice hotel.  I'm in a Holiday Inn Express.  Yeah, in Brooklyn.  It's awesome.  In Brooklyn.  And I just, like, I'm sitting right next to an ice machine.  There's a noise going on, and there's something about not being able to sleep.  Because, like, within 20 minutes of not being able to sleep, I'm like, I want to fucking die.  I have no recourse.  What, am I going to go down to the Holiday Inn Express desk and go, can I get another room and fucking deal with that bullshit? 
[01:51:30]  So I sit there and listen to these noises that I assume are rodents or parasites or very large bed bugs in the fucking wall.  And I have no recourse other than to sit there and go, this is fucking horrible.  I can't sleep.  I don't want to live anymore.  Yeah, yeah.  That's where I'd go with it.  I think I've lost my love for New York City.  I don't know what the fuck happened to me.  I have no tolerance for this parade of bullshit that comes at me every day.  It's like an assault.  I'm up in the hills in Los Angeles, and not the nice hills.  I live in the hills of the barrio. 
[01:52:00]  But I got my own house.  I got my own car, and I can get in it and drive.  Here I get on the subway, and I'm like, I feel like I'm being psychically molested by fucking everybody on the goddamn train.  I'm covered with their sweat, and now it's wet out, and it's grimy.  I got off a train the other night in Brooklyn, and they were hosing down the walls of the thing and creating that mist.  And I'm like, now I'm inside a tubercular lung.  This is like layers of fucking microbes.  Legionnaire disease.  Exactly.  And I used to think like, oh, this is great.  We're all one people, and it's an organic being, and I'm just a cell in it. 
[01:52:30]  Now I'm like, this is fucking disgusting.  I can't take it anymore.  There's no way for me to rationalize it.  Isn't that amazing how that happens?  You get a little older, and you start to...  It's not like, yeah, I just like the feel of New York City, that grit, and this, and then it just becomes...  This is terrible.  It's awful.  It's like disgusting.  It's grimy.  I was in an apartment, what, two days ago.  I was able to shoot a scene with Louie for the new show, which I'm excited about.  And they were shooting in an apartment. 
[01:53:00]  And back in the day, it was in Dumbo.  It was a big floor through.  It was a huge apartment.  And 10 years ago, I went, God, this is a great place.  But I walked in there, and I'm like, you know what's amazing about a New York City apartment?  Even the best ones, you're never going to get it fucking clean.  There's grime all over it, and you just live with that.  The windowsills are full of garbage, you know, right at the edge.  The floors are wood, and they're never going to get clean.  And you're like, this is great.  No, it's not.  Pigs live in this place.  And you're rationalizing it, because you can put posters up on the wall.  For a lot of money, too. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, for like probably $2,000, $2,200, $2,500 a month, you get to sit in that shit and go like,  yeah, I don't really need a kitchen.  This is just a sink.  Yeah.  A hot place.  And they get away with it.  People are buying.  We're renting.  Oh, man.  Is there a place in Brooklyn that you went to in Greenpoint?  No, no.  No, they were shooting.  There was a location.  But it was a nice place, but I don't want to live like that anymore.  I can't deal with this shit anymore.  I'm aggravated.  I'm getting furious at everybody.  And I was feeling pretty good about myself when I got to New York.  I've been here three days, and I don't know what it means to be alive anymore.  Stay in a better hotel. 
[01:54:00]  I know, right?  You're doing good.  What happens is you start to do good in life, and you're successful.  So treat yourself.  I'm not saying spend $20,000 a night on a hotel, but stay in a better place in the Holiday Inn Express.  It's horrible, man.  It's nothing but German tourists who are eating this horrible free bacon.  And if I don't like a free breakfast buffet, it's got to be real shit, because that makes me happy.  If I walk into a hotel and there's a waffle maker, I'm like, how bad could tomorrow be?  But I didn't want to fucking eat that shit. 
[01:54:30]  I kind of like those dumb hotels, too.  Yeah, but I would rather stay in a Marriott Suite hotel.  Yeah, exactly.  I love the Marriott Suite.  They're the best.  Yeah, because it feels like your birthday when you wake up.  Like, I can eat all I want, and I'm going to take three boxes and one for later.  And some need for a different.  Shitty scrambled eggs is something to be said about that sometimes.  No, it's great.  You feel like you're being treated well.  You know the cheapest fucking hotel in this city is like $400 a night, and I'm too much of a Jew or something.  To write off.  To tell a write off.  Yeah, I know it's a write-up, but I think, like, all right, I spent six hours here, I slept, I jerked off. 
[01:55:00]  Was that worth $400?  Yeah.  It's worth, if you can do it, you don't have any children, you're not married.  If you can do it, fucking just do it to, like, it's almost like this is my life.  I can afford it.  Why not just live decent?  I'm not saying overspend, but don't underspend, either.  Well, I made some improvements on my house, so I, you know, I'm not, I don't know if I have the disposable income right now.  I put in central air and heat.  How long did it take me to put that in?  Dude, I live in, like, on the outskirts of the east part of L.A., and it gets hot as shit. 
[01:55:30]  Sweltering.  I've been there since 2004, and every year, all summer, I'm just like, I'm just going to sit in my car.  You know what I'm going to do?  Yeah, I'm going to go to the movies again.  Like, and I just saw, like, and I swear to you, my ex-wife would be like, you know, why can't we just do this?  And I'd give, like, $11,000 to do the whole house.  I'm like, well, how long's the summer?  We'll get through it.  I swear to God, if I would have put central air and I think I would have still been married.  It's the best thing I ever did in my entire life.  Yeah, you got to spend, sometimes you spend the money, like, oh, yeah, this is the good thing about making money.  It's like, I can live better.  I love that, walking into a nice, cool house. 
[01:56:00]  I'm not wasting my drugs.  Right?  Yeah.  Like, laying in bed with a ceiling fan, and that's not even working.  You're still sweating in your bed.  And some part of me is like, I can get through this.  How many more weeks do I have?  That's the worst part is trying to fucking sleep with no air conditioning when it's just hot out.  Even that dumb ceiling fan doesn't work.  It's just blowing hot air.  And it's just stuffy.  Why not the room conditioner, though?  Those are, I like the room conditioners just as much as central air.  Well, no, they got that, the windows I have out there, they're not made for anything.  I blast it like a meat locker. 
[01:56:30]  I need that room to be like 67 degrees when I go to sleep.  Yeah, cold.  And then, yeah, and then I'm, like, cold when I get up.  Now, I'd rather just get blankets.  You know, in the summer, if I can have to get blankets, I'm like, that's fine.  That's what it is.  I want the room to be cold, and I want blankets on me.  I don't know why, but it kind of works.  I've earned this.  You could regulate your temperature by sticking a leg out into the coldness and pull it back a little.  I don't fucking know.  Constantly adjusting all night long.  Yeah, just keep that carbon footprint as large as possible. 
[01:57:00]  Kaiser blows.  It's coming in there, Mark.  Is it?  Yeah, they're saying it blows.  Well, I know, but it was reasonable.  The docs are a joke.  You better hope there's nothing wrong with him.  If so, he's done.  Great.  That's a good way to start my day.  That's only one guy, though.  That's only one guy.  Yeah, but that's the Internet.  Maybe we'll find one guy for you to go there.  The Internet just told me that I'm fucked.  The Internet's sad.  Huh?  That was the Internet's sad.  That was Larry Allstate on the phone.  Larry Allstate.  I could have went with something else, but I called that, you know, like now there's some people that I could actually call in show business. 
[01:57:30]  Ken Jeong used to be a doctor at Kaiser.  No.  Yeah.  He's still a doctor.  A real doctor.  No, I knew he did all that.  No, no.  I didn't realize he actually practiced.  Oh, yeah, he did.  When he started doing comedy, he was still an emergency room doctor.  But I called him, and apparently the one in California, Southern California, is rated pretty high.  I'll do check you out.  I'll do that.  Take a break from your trailer.  Can I knock on it?  Yeah.  He owes you.  Yeah, yeah.  He probably would, actually, but it would be awkward.  I'd show up at his house. 
[01:58:00]  He's like, this is not appropriate.  I'm like, I don't care.  I need an examination.  Check out my head.  One more podcast question.  How does it feel that you kind of blazed a path in everyone's podcasting now?  We can all kind of look at you.  I mean, you were the first big one.  I lucked into it in a way.  You know, I just had no real expectation out of it.  I was desperate.  I was broke.  I was unhappy.  We remember.  Yeah.  We were around in those early days.  We were like, I don't know.  I'm going to try this podcast thing.  I remember the conversation.  You get this weird run where you're like, I feel great. 
[01:58:30]  I did something.  Then you feel like, you know, fuck, am I still relevant?  Is it still going to work out?  I mean, is this guy doing me better than I'm doing me?  Do people still give a shit about what I'm doing?  How do I make this more interesting?  Maybe if I interview my asshole, this would be better.  Those guys seem to do well with it.  So I don't know what the hell is going to happen.  Now I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop.  Yeah.  In the early days, I don't remember anymore.  Were you getting the big guests in the early days?  It was a lot of comics, obviously, and a lot of popular comics.  But it was tough in the beginning, right, to get people? 
[01:59:00]  Yeah.  No, but I had guys.  You know, I mean, I have a lot of friends.  And, you know, I've been doing comedy the last long time.  But now it's like you could get pretty much anyone, it seems like.  No, not really.  Not really.  Who do you want that you have been able to get?  Is there anybody?  Yeah.  I mean, I'd like to interview.  I've never talked to Will Ferrell.  Because I don't do junket shit.  I don't do plug shit.  You know, it's really they're going to have to sit down.  I did Albert Brooks.  I tried to get him on.  I want to try to get Shelly Berman on.  I wanted to do Shecky Green.  I had this dream.  Wow.  You know, because my grandmother loved Shecky Green. 
[01:59:30]  So I'm like, I'm going to go find Shecky Green.  I had this whole episode planned where I was going to take a drive, take the mics with me,  like some pilgrimage to Palm Springs to interview this great Buddha of comedy, right?  So I find a website, Shecky Green's website.  And I'm like, all right.  It looked like it was 20 years old, like no one went to it.  I said, what the fuck?  I'll email this website.  So I email the website.  And within two days, I get an email back.  It says, Mr. Green will talk to you.  This is his cell phone number.  Don't tell anyone.  Like, you know, like there's a big demand.  Like people are like, I had Shecky Green's phone number. 
[02:00:00]  But the weird thing is, I don't call him, right?  I just, I kind of get, I put it on the back burner.  And then I read an article.  There's this guy, Cliff Nestorhoff.  You ever read his shit on the WFMU blog?  He writes about old comedy.  And he wrote this whole article about Shecky Green being this crazy, you know, manic,  depressive, alcoholic lunatic who got in a fight for a gun with Buddy Hackett.  And he's the guy who's credited with that great line because he never wanted to be a Rat Pack guy.  He had that joke where he said, you know, Frank Sinatra saved my life.  He said, all right, that's enough, fellas.  That was a Shecky Green joke, right? 
[02:00:30]  It's a great joke.  But then this article reminds me, like, I got to call Shecky Green.  So I read this article.  I don't know this guy, Cliff, at all.  I just love his writing.  Call the Shecky Green number.  And I go, hey, Mr. Green, this is Mark Maron.  I emailed you a while back about doing my podcast.  It's like a radio show.  And I hear this guy go, did you write that fucking article?  And I'm like, no, I didn't.  I didn't write that article.  I said, who the fuck wrote that article?  I'm not doing any more interviews.  That was bullshit.  Nothing about the charities.  He said nothing about the charities. 
[02:01:00]  That's all they care about.  No matter what kind of asshole they are.  If they live long enough, like, I did good things.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right?  So I get on the phone.  I'm like, no, I didn't write it.  He goes, I'm not talking to fucking anybody.  Where the hell did that guy get that shit?  And I just happened to have read it.  I don't know how it got to him.  Right.  Where he would have found this obscure blog to read this article about him.  But he was livid about it.  So I said, look, I think I know where the guy wrote it.  I'll try to contact him for you.  He's like, I'm not doing any more fucking interviews.  I'm like, all right, I get it.  He says, you call that guy if you could. 
[02:01:30]  So I just find an email for this guy on the website, this guy Nestorhoff.  And I wrote, yeah, I don't know if you know me.  My name is Mark Merritt.  I do a podcast.  But I just got off the phone with Shecky Green.  He's furious.  And he wants to know where you got that shit.  And within like 10 minutes, he emails me back.  And it just says, he told me.  Now, can't you?  You should email Shecky back and tell him he'll talk about the charities.  Maybe he'll do the podcast.  So you got to get your side of the story out there.  Yeah, about the charities.  We'll talk about the charities. 
[02:02:00]  And then just get them off on a tangent.  Yeah, I just don't.  Come on, dude.  You got to do it before he dies.  All right.  You'll regret it forever.  I'll do it.  I want to do Shelly Berman, too.  I like to do Iggy Pop.  There's a few people out there.  You get Shecky.  Have you done Bob Newhart?  No, I'd love to do him, but I can't.  Ron Bennington did Bob Newhart.  We went to the taping.  Was it great?  We got to meet him.  Oh, fuck.  It was great.  I reached out to him, but you don't know.  I don't know.  I don't have any juice.  And you don't know.  You have a great list of people you've done.  I think Bob Newhart would do it.  I think so.  But all I got is a number for his assistant.  I tried.  I called somebody, and I don't know if it ever went through. 
[02:02:30]  Have you done Leno or Leno or Conan or any other shows?  Yeah.  Conan came over.  Conan did it?  Yeah.  That was kind of weird.  How was it?  It was great.  Because, like, you know, I've been doing his show for, what, 12, 15 years?  You know, I mean, we have an on-air relationship, but I've never had a conversation with the  guy.  And that was actually a weird one, because, you know, he came over, and I don't know  him in plain clothes.  You know, I've never seen him in casual gear.  You know, and this guy, you know.  Just a suit.  Yeah, and he's tall.  But we had this on-air thing.  He's been very good to me over my career.  But he comes over, and I'm like, hey, it's weird, you know, because, like, because 
[02:03:00]  then you're interviewing him as opposed to, yeah.  And he's sitting in the garage in your house.  Yeah.  And he's in my little shitty house.  You know, and he's sitting there sweating and talking, and, you know.  But that was one of those moments where, you know, after, you know, and I told him about  this, you know, after he sort of lingered, you know, like, it was like five, you know,  seven, probably seven at night.  The sun's already down, and we finished the interview, and he's in my dining room, and  we're just standing there.  And he's sort of lingering, and I couldn't handle it.  There was part of me that's like, what's he doing here?  I got to get Conan out of my house. 
[02:03:30]  Right.  Because, like, what's going to happen?  We're not friends, really.  Oh, man.  It's not like I'll see you at the house, or, you know, maybe we'll have dinner or something.  It's done.  It's over.  It's done.  Get out of here.  You're making me uncomfortable now.  Right.  Right.  We have a few of those after the mics are off.  Meanwhile, he's trying to be friends with you because he probably likes you a lot.  And he's like, well, this is a real moment.  Let me hang out with Mark.  It's a non-show thing.  Maybe he's lonely.  Maybe nervous, though.  Like, I didn't know how to handle it.  And there's still that part of me where I respect the position.  You know what I mean?  Like, I'm a guest on his show.  He's the guy with the show. 
[02:04:00]  So how did it end?  It was great.  No, how did you get him out?  Well, I kind of shuffled towards the door.  All right.  All right, Ben.  All right.  All right.  Oh, look at the time.  Yeah.  There we go.  You probably got to get home.  Am I right?  Yeah, I'm sure you're a busy guy.  That's small talk.  Ugh.  No, but it was all right.  That's a nice small talk.  I had a good time.  I did his show last week.  And, you know, he's got me in regular rotation again.  And it's been fun.  Like, he finally got back to that kind of like we're just hanging out.  And it was great.  Yeah, I mean, I've talked to him, but I've not talked to Leno. 
[02:04:30]  And I don't think I can get at Lenormand.  You know, people always, you know, they tweet me.  It's like, hey, you got to get Woody Allen.  Yeah, okay.  I'll get right on that.  As if I have the power to just sort of like, yeah, Woody, let's do this.  You got the same managers as Robin, though.  You got Robin.  Yeah, but that was tough.  I mean, you know, Robin, you know, who you know and I know, he shows up and he's nice.  And, you know, he knows me and I know him.  But, you know, when he agrees to do something, then you're given an email contact.  And then you have the layers that you have to go through.  Because he's fairly protective.  You know, you have to sign a deal in that, you know, how long is the terms of usage and whatnot. 
[02:05:00]  Wow.  Well, I think that people have misused his name.  Like, I think there was years ago there was something he was associated with where they took advantage of his placement in the credits or something.  And, like, I think that those guys who were Brandon to themselves, they got to protect themselves.  He was cool once we did it.  But I had to go to his house.  That was another interesting thing.  Well, tell us about it because I want to hear about it.  About the Robin thing?  Yeah, because I didn't hear that one yet.  Because you asked him tough questions, man.  Like, you gave him a real interview, which he probably appreciated. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, because he's kind of a goofball.  Well, that was, you know, it would have been, like, I drove to his house at, like, 11 in the morning.  You know, I'm driving over the Bay Bridge.  You know, he's up in the San Francisco area.  I got the mic on in the car going, like, look at me.  I'm driving to Robin Williams' house.  I feel like sort of an asshole in a way, you know.  So, well, there's that weird moment when you do it, when I go out elsewhere.  Like, I remember when I interviewed Judd Apatow, I'm, like, hooking my mics up in my car to go interview a guy who's younger than me, who owns show business.  I'm like, this is where I'm at.  I'm in my Camry.  I'm hooking mics up to a tape recorder. 
[02:06:00]  But it was great.  But I get to Robin's house.  It was just weird because it's 11 in the afternoon.  We go into his house.  Nice house?  Sure.  It was nice.  You know, it was a newer place because I think, you know, when he broke up with his wife, he had another place or whatever.  But, of course, it was nice.  You know, and he's not going to be like, yeah, I'm just living in my garage.  But I get in there, and we sit down, and it's just me and him in his house.  And he talked about, you know, the heart attack.  He talked about the relapse.  I asked him about joke stealing and all this stuff.  What did he say about joke stealing?  Is he known for that?  Yeah, he had a reputation for it. 
[02:06:30]  I heard that he would hang out in the back of rooms and stuff, and people wouldn't go on stage.  Right.  He's that guy, right?  See, I never believed that he actually purposely was like, fuck.  I think he's one of those guys that picked up things.  That's right.  That he heard.  I don't think he was like a purposeful scumbag.  No, no, he wasn't.  And that's why I went and interviewed him, because despite whatever you feel about him, I got sick of fucking 23-year-old comics going, oh, fucking Robin Williams is a hack.  He's a thief.  It's like, who the fuck are you?  He's not a hack.  Well, this guy did exactly what you want to do.  He was in his mid-20s.  He got a huge deal, and he sustained a career in show business for 40-some-odd fucking years, and you're going to condescend, you three-joke asshole with no fucking point of view? 
[02:07:00]  So I had spite when I went into it.  But yeah, you're right, though.  He's one of those guys.  He's very manic.  When he's someplace, he hears something, and after a certain amount of time, he no longer can attach it to where it came from.  I saw how it could happen.  He came to watch me at that Brock Morton Theater.  Mark Pitted runs a gig right by his house, and he's up there a lot.  And he came up after.  It was when I was doing the demon bit. 
[02:07:30]  And Robin came up to me.  He's like, ooh, that demon bit.  He's very good.  You know, you should get it.  And then he started riffing on my bit.  Oh, shit.  And I thought, like, with that kind of brain, how long before you lose touch of a source?  Not on purpose.  And just start doing it and work it into his act.  Right.  So I don't think it's intentional.  He was at the cellar one night, me and Colin down to watch him.  This is years, like, 98 when he first started coming in.  And we're watching him, and it's like, you don't know what you're going to think or what you're going to feel.  But Colin said, well, watch it because he was on fire.  It was all topical, brand new stuff.  There's no way he didn't write it. 
[02:08:00]  It was too new.  Right.  And Colin looked at me and goes, he does have a genius streak.  You know, it's easy to knock the guy, but when you really sit there and you watch him and you realize what he's doing,  it's like, you're right.  You get jaded from listening to other shitty, jealous comics when you realize that, okay, he's got that part that I wish he didn't have.  But when all is said and done, he has been a great comedian.  It's like, he is a funny dude.  And also, how the fuck, I mean, do you know anybody that can sustain a career at the level he's sustained it at for that long?  After a certain point, you do this long enough, you can have whatever opinions you want of anybody and say, 
[02:08:30]  he's a fucking asshole, you know, it's bullshit, he does bullshit.  You know what?  He's fucking working.  Just shut up.  And he has forever.  Right.  People ask me, like, what do you want?  What do you want out of your career right now?  Well, I just want to, I don't want to die broke and I'd like to have health insurance.  Is that too much to ask?  That's all.  Like, do you have no dreams?  That's my dream.  Not to die broke and have health insurance.  That's reasonable.  Wow.  These young guys, these three joke guys, like you said, what bothers me is somebody who's in the business for six or seven years, 
[02:09:00]  pontificating about who's a hack?  Well, T.J. Miller did it to fucking Dane Cook recently.  Well, that's original.  T.J. texted me.  Yeah, no, but he had no right to do that.  I think he apologized.  To Dane?  Yeah.  Yeah, too late.  Damage was done.  I don't know exactly what.  You're a fucking asshole.  That was an anger reaction or something.  He's like, no, no, that wasn't.  We should interview him about that because there was something else to that.  I mean, people become a punchline.  I think he was like, Dane bumped him.  I'm not saying it was right, but it was a reaction to something. 
[02:09:30]  But you guys get that right.  Yeah.  You guys have been in the business so long, you have that right.  Absolutely.  You have to bump some young guys.  I agree.  Everyone knows about that.  I don't quite have that right yet.  Oh, I'm sure you've bumped guys.  Do I have that?  No, I don't.  No?  No.  Okay.  I mean, I really don't have that.  I can't walk into play.  I got one spot at the cellar on Saturday.  You haven't been around.  Yeah, I know exactly.  Yeah, I haven't been around.  So, like, if I had the right to bump, don't you think if Esty saw that I was coming, she'd be like, let's give Mark all four spots.  No, I got one. 
[02:10:00]  I got the 830.  Fair enough.  You know, I get there.  You know who bumped me one time and it annoyed me?  It was at the improv in L.A.  Yeah.  David Spade bumped me.  And I didn't mind being bumped by him because he's a much bigger name.  So, I got that.  But I was about to go on and he was scheduled for one person after me.  It was supposed to be me and then David.  But then he wanted to switch and go before me.  And as he's ready to go on, he says, he looks at me and he goes, hey, man, I remember when Robin Williams used to do this to me.  I wanted to go, well, you're not him, shithead.  That's a dick.  I'm not complaining.  He was trying to make it okay, but he didn't realize how arrogant he sounded. 
[02:10:30]  Look, if you just go up and do 15 minutes, that's fine.  But, you know, it's like there's a point where, you know, if you're just a guy and you're here to do your spot, maybe you got another spot.  And someone comes in and you're like, he's going to do an hour at least.  You're like, fuck it.  Mencia did it to me once on a night when my name was on the marquee at the Hollywood Improv.  That's shitty.  Well, you know, he actually apologized for that on my podcast because I had personal experience with that because I knew he was bumping people at a spot.  Just this, you know, sort of swinging dick bullshit. 
[02:11:00]  Look who's in charge.  But my name was on the marquee and those motherfuckers at that club let him do it.  And it's like my name's out there.  I got a few people, maybe seven came to see me.  Right.  But it's my name out there.  And then he comes and he's like, we're just going to put him on.  And he goes on stage and I'm like, I'm fucking leaving.  You know, this is you did this.  So I left.  I'm not going to wait for you.  Oh, you did leave.  Oh, fuck yes, I left.  I mean, what am I supposed to do?  It's like he's he's he's he's drawn a line, you know, follow that asshole.  Yeah, I'm not going to play that game with that douchebag.  I saw Dice bump the entire room at the comedy store. 
[02:11:30]  Well, but, you know, it was different.  He's got it right.  All the comics that were supposed to, you know, go on that night.  One by one, I saw him leave it like, oh, fuck, I'm out now.  I'm out now.  I'm done.  Well, he did like close.  He did like two and a half hours.  Right.  Because the club's going to close.  Right.  There, you know, those guys.  Most of those guys live at that place.  I just thought it was hilarious.  Yeah, he was like I saw him like it blew like you go through like, yeah, I used to do the  store when I was a doorman there when I was younger and it took me a long time to actually  work there.  But I remember when I was a doorman, he was that's when he got big was when I was working 
[02:12:00]  there.  Like I was the guy at the door and he was just, you know, coming into all of it.  And I used to watch him and I had not really seen him do stand up in like 15 or 20 years  and I was at the store and this is, you know, before I had him on my show and he just  came in and he did 40 minutes and, you know, he just dressed like he just got out of his  car.  He didn't nothing.  And he just talked about going to Staples with his kid.  And I was like, this is great.  I was so relieved after, you know, a parade of guys where you could close your eyes and  you don't even know who's who, you know, and that's not to say they're bad comics. 
[02:12:30]  Just to see a guy get up there with gravitas and be surprised by Dice just saying like  it because it's all the affectation is gone.  It's just you forget what a point of view he has.  It's like he's got a way of seeing things and it was fucking hilarious.  It's just 40 minutes.  It was great.  He's a very underrated comic.  Like he's really famous.  But when you see these shitty comedy central lists, he never gets the respect he deserves  on these lists.  It's like when you look at his body of work, he's talked about everything in the last 20  years he's had material on and funny shit on everything in the last every bit of news 
[02:13:00]  last 20 years.  He's had, like you said, some kind of point of view on it.  And I think he's very underrated in the overall scheme of comics.  I think that's because of what you get pissed off about.  I do think that there's a little bit of revisionism around, because if there's political turmoil  around somebody, that's going to sort of sully them somehow.  Yeah.  Because, you know, there was like, I didn't I didn't go back and look at his shit, you  know, before I talked to him, because I was so excited to see him that night at the comedy 
[02:13:30]  store.  And I just he's he's a very endearing, unique person.  I think it gets overshadowed with almost the caricature that he was years ago.  Yeah, because I went back and watch that shit from the 80s and some of it was pretty gnarly.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I mean, you know, I'm watching him like, holy fuck, he's talking about, you know, hanging  gay guys from lampposts.  But, yeah, you know, but it wasn't the character and he was, you know, a different person.  So what are you going to do?  You're going to sit there and have a guy in and like, you know, 20 years ago you did  this and that's it. 
[02:14:00]  Well, fuck it.  And then you go and then you go.  So you just treat people with respect.  And, you know, he's got he's a great comic and he's a fucking original.  It is.  How often does that happen?  Bring up that whole thing with his point of view on things.  And you don't realize, like, he can just talk about, you know, the telephone, that  telephone ringing ring, ring, fucking hilarious.  And no one is better.  He can dominate.  You know how hard it is to do a phone or on a radio show?  Yeah.  He can dominate a room on the phone.  He's really good on the fucking radio, man. 
[02:14:30]  I've done plenty of radio with him.  It's just basically just watch him talk for fucking hours.  He's also a little menacing.  You don't want to fuck you.  He's like, I literally, you know, like when he came over to my house, I was like, I don't  want to make daddy mad.  You know, like he's one of those guys where you're like, you know, like you could just  hit one button and it's going to be a shit storm.  Yeah.  You don't want to deal with it.  We have hours and hours of dice.  Great radio with that guy.  I want to go backwards.  Carl's Mencia.  Where are you at with that?  We're fine.  Did it just happen?  No, no.  That was like, you know, we just put out that thing.  You had it up there.  No, I mean, you grabbed the back of your head. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, I'm all right.  I just want to massage it.  I'm okay.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Dude, I don't know.  Are you drinking enough water with all the caffeine and nicotine?  You might be dehydrated.  You got to get up the nicotine gum.  If you're on it that long, just tough it out.  Mark, just grab the back of his head real quick.  I'm just misogynist.  Okay.  But the Mencia thing, we're fine.  I mean, he...  Where are you at with that?  I mean, because, you know, it's been talked about a lot with him stealing and this and  that.  No, look, I mean, look, I did a thing with him and I did two episodes. 
[02:15:30]  We just released the first 100 WTFs on MP3 on a DVD.  Nice.  Good for you, man.  And, you know, you can only get that episode if you do the premium thing or whatever.  But, look, I did two hours with him.  You know, I didn't...  You know, I pushed him a little bit.  I let him talk.  You know, we're fine.  You know, and he actually apologized for bumping me that night.  You know, did I get to the bottom of anything?  You know, if you listen to the second hour I did with him, you can judge.  You know, you definitely see him as a person.  He's got, you know, he's got some trouble upstairs.  What are you going to do?  It really hurt him.  I tell you, that Rogan video, oh, dude, it stopped. 
[02:16:00]  It derailed him.  I mean, I've never seen...  A defining moment of negativity in somebody's career was that...  You can't see them that often.  But, like, for Dice, the Arsenio thing, I think, kind of changed things.  For that, that changed him a lot worse.  Well, yeah, because, and then, like, to a certain point, it got so tired.  They both, they're both tired of talking about it, both him and Rogan.  Like, you know, it got to a point where you realize, holy shit, that's their wedding video.  Yeah.  How are they going to separate themselves from that? 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  And I think it's old news, and, you know, let it, you know, just...  Have they ever made up or talked or no?  I have no idea.  You know, I'm okay with Joe, and I'm okay with Carlos.  I mean, I didn't, you know, do anything to piss either of them off.  But I...  But, you know, the weird thing about that is, after a certain point, you just got to get on with it.  I mean, how am I going to hang on to that shit?  Well, Dice is coming down the hall.  We should, we absolutely should take a break.  Let's break real quick.  We have to.  Mark, you going to stick around?  If you want me to, stick around.  Absolutely.  Mark Maron's here. 
[02:17:00]  WTFpod.com.  I'm a fanboy of his podcast.  Quick, he's going to walk right in.  And Mark Maron on Twitter.  M-A-R-C-M-A-R-O-N.  Mark Maron on Twitter.  Dice is next.  Series XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  All right, let me set this up.  We got Mark Maron in studio from WTFpod.com.  And also, Andrew Dice Clay has made his entrance.  Very happy to be here.  He's smoking. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, no.  He's lost a shitload of weight.  Oh, Dice.  It's a different Dice.  It's a different Dice in here.  It's a cigarette diet.  It's a cigarette training program.  You don't think that's appropriate?  I just got over, like, fucking a horrid cough.  He had the whooping cough.  I don't know why people piss on cigarettes when it really helps you get into the shape  you need and helps you train.  Get your metabolism up.  Yeah, it gets your metabolism going.  You lose weight with it.  Nice.  You know what I mean?  Because you're really not allowed to smoke in restaurants. 
[02:18:00]  You're not allowed to smoke anywhere at this point.  Or the gym, either.  You're not allowed to smoke outside.  Yeah, yeah.  I know, I love when they come outside, like, Starbucks, and they go, no smoking.  Yeah.  You know, and I'm looking at them like, why can't I smoke outside in the street?  Outside the place.  Well, you have to be 10 feet away.  There's no joke there.  No, it's just a conversation.  We're just talking.  How much weight did you lose? 
[02:18:30]  Well, it's radio, though, for the people out there.  You know what?  Total, I would say about 30.  I think it's more than 30.  You know.  Well, it's a year.  Was it going back to the cigarettes that they did there?  No.  Okay.  No, that was a joke, Anthony.  You know what?  A lot of people get their gain weight when they stop smoking.  What's your routine, though?  What's that?  What's your routine?  What do you mean?  Like, what do you do to work out?  Oh, you're asking me.  Yeah.  You know, Mark did one of the best interviews on me ever.  Ah, he remembers.  Yeah.  That's great.  No, he was really great. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, you were on his podcast.  I didn't know what to expect, because it was actually the first podcast.  I did.  My biggest fear was that you were going to be hot in my garage.  I knew it was hot in there, and I didn't want you to start sweating and get aggravated.  Yeah, but I like garage living.  You know what I mean?  I like that kind of hang.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's not even joking.  He used to call me from his garage.  You know, guys call you.  He used to hide in the garage.  But how do I make this loud?  Or why am I on law?  What?  How do I do this?  What are you doing?  Make it loud in your head.  Oh, there we go.  Can you hear me now? 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, we can hear you.  Yeah, like people that are doing podcasts out of everywhere, you know?  Holy fuck, we're all going to get long cancer.  I do a podcast from my car three times a week.  I'm a traveling podcast, you guys.  It's unbelievable how they do them.  People love it.  You also did, I guess, Rogan's recently, right?  Yeah, I did Rogan's last week.  Which, you know, I didn't realize that you could just keep going.  Like, I'm thinking it's a TV show.  Right, right.  You know, like with Mark, what we did?  Like an hour?  Yeah, we did two and a half hours.  Yeah, yeah.  I was exhausted. 
[02:20:00]  Joe will go.  I felt like I did three shows.  I had no rest.  Like, what the fuck did I just go through with you?  Joe's a bundle of energy, I'll tell you.  He really is.  He can go off for three hours.  He doesn't care.  He's an animal.  He really is an animal.  And that's not hot, too.  He's the only guy in comedy I'd never want to get mad.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's the only guy.  I saw him in a karate magazine just with the full split.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, you know he could kill you.  You know he could kill you in a second.  Well, I told him that.  Not just physically, mentally. 
[02:20:30]  You're the only guy in stand-up I would never want to have a fight with.  Yeah, yeah.  Because there's no win here.  No.  You know, even if you get the pipe.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  You ever see the video of him showing George St. Pierre how to do back kicks?  He's fucking, he's showing him how to do back kicks.  Rogan is a fucking monster.  Yeah, no, he really is.  He's been doing that since he was a kid.  Like, when I remember him when he first started, he was a kickboxer.  Yeah, he's a 75th black belt.  Yeah.  That's a lot.  Yeah.  Last time.  Last time. 
[02:21:00]  What were you going to ask, Dice?  I don't want to forget all the good stuff we were talking about before we got in here.  I know I wanted to ask you about the Stardust, which was something I wanted.  But we used to work at the Stardust.  Yeah.  And I stayed in the suite because you had bought the house.  Why did you not want to do it?  The Stardust was fucking haunted, wasn't it?  Like, you didn't want to stay there.  You were creeped out by the Stardust for some reason.  It's just shitty rooms.  No, but you were all...  But you were all...  There was also some kind of a weird haunting there.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I had a weird experience.  Maybe you don't remember, but yeah, you refused to stay there.  What happened to you?  I just heard weird fucking pool ball... 
[02:21:30]  Pool...  Cue ball noises upstairs.  I thought you guys had come back to the room.  Wow.  And they hadn't, and I went upstairs, and there was fucking nobody.  It was the creepiest thing that's ever happened to me.  I'm not a ghost story guy.  There was only one time we all hung out in the room with you.  In your room.  No, that was...  It was your room.  You gave it to me.  Because you didn't want to stay in there because it was a creepy...  It was that fucking attached tower to the Stardust.  Yeah, so I figured I'd give it to you.  Yeah, you did.  It was nice.  It was a nice gesture.  And I had two rooms.  I had my regular room in the suite, which you gave me.  And then Dyson saying he might have thrown someone down the stairs.  Or were you going to...  Oh, no, that's like a week ago. 
[02:22:00]  I was doing a show in Vegas at the Riviera.  Right.  Because I'm doing this long run there this year.  And, you know, I'm like backstage hanging with...  Because I had Max opening, and then Eleanor, and then myself.  And all of a sudden, I hear Eleanor.  She never really snaps out on stage.  You know, when she's heckled, she knows how to handle people.  She just tears them up.  But all of a sudden, she goes, I gave you eight fucking minutes again, you motherfucker.  And that's really not her act. 
[02:22:30]  You know, that's more like how she acts in bed.  And so I start screaming to promote.  I go, get that fucking guy out of here.  I don't want to fucking see him.  You know, so the promoter goes running.  And two minutes later, I'm like with Max in the back.  I go, these fucking cocksuckers that look to ruin a show.  And I come out like the back door.  And I'm in full...  You know, I'm ready to go on.  Yeah.  I'm going on like in three minutes.  And Valerie, my wife, is fighting with the guy's wife. 
[02:23:00]  You know what I mean?  Because he's getting...  So I come out the back and I go, you motherfucker.  And he goes, uh, Dice, I'm here to see you.  I go, you don't understand.  You weren't going to see me.  I was going to throw you out anyway.  You're just a drunken cocksucker with your fucking whole wife.  You know, and he's going, the fuck you said?  I go, I swear, I'll throw you down the fucking escalator, you fucking prick.  Right?  And now here comes Valerie pushing me back into the backstage. 
[02:23:30]  Going, that's what he wants.  I go, what?  To get thrown down a flight of steps?  Get the fuck off me.  And then Max grabs me in the back.  And he goes, I don't care what Valerie said.  That's the greatest thing I ever saw.  That was actually better for the guy than if he saw the show.  Right?  He goes, he got a personal show.  A personal touch.  Yeah, because, you know, they get so fucking drunk today in the audiences.  Yeah.  You know, I have no patience for it, so I'd rather just throw them out. 
[02:24:00]  Wait, is that true?  Guys are drinking a lot more in the audiences?  Guys are drinking more in general.  Yeah.  A hundred percent true.  Not just guys.  The girls are worse.  I had drunk ladies yesterday.  And it wasn't like that when you guys were coming up?  Fucking annoying.  Not as much.  This joke is wild that happens to want you to, by the way, up in, where is it?  I'm guessing Syracuse or in that area?  Is it upstate New York?  I don't even know where the fuck I was.  Or is it in the Midwest?  Is that what you're telling me?  I don't know where it is.  It's in the club.  Connecticut.  Connecticut.  That's right.  New York.  Thank you.  Thank you, Kenny. 
[02:24:30]  You had a coffin just opened and a voice came out of it.  And this fucking chick wants to open her mouth.  I'm like five minutes before I, you know, get to the end.  And she's drunk and sloppy.  You know how to sit with the bare feet, these little fucking new generation pieces of shit.  Right.  And she just starts being loud and obnoxious.  So I start just cursing at her.  You know, I go, excuse me, cunt.  You know.  And she locks you.  I dare you call me that. 
[02:25:00]  And I go, look, you ain't fucking pretty enough to be talking in an audience.  You're ugly.  You know that, right?  It's like I had this fight with a lady at Westbury the other night.  You know how I talk about fat chicks, how I like fat.  So here comes this little fat roly-poly fuck, you know, onto the stage.  Of course, nobody stops.  So, you know.  And at first I hug her and then she starts yelling at me.  So I'm going, get out of here, fatso.  Like I'm not even going for the joke. 
[02:25:30]  I'm using like, you know, grammar school argument.  That's what Florian said.  And she's giving me the finger.  I go, get the fuck out of here, fatso.  And I'm yelling at her husband.  How do you fuck this blob of shit?  How dented up are her fucking legs like somebody took a sledgehammer to it?  None of them know how to put down fucking ranch dressing.  They drink it like it's a bowl of fucking cum on top of that salad.  Florian said it was like listening to a kindergartner yell at somebody. 
[02:26:00]  I never said I'm mature.  So, as a matter of fact, I was going to bring up this attache case of candy I have.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got this from, you know, Larry Locksmith.  He gave me an attache case filled with all the candies that I love.  The Neckos.  Dice likes candy.  Oh, we all know that.  And the dots.  And the giant dots.  And the nonpareils.  You like the Necco wafers? 
[02:26:30]  You like shitty candy.  Oh, yeah.  The worst.  You like shitty candy.  Dots are a pain in the ass.  Dots suck.  You eat half of it.  You eat paper and shit.  I'm not done.  That's what candy necklaces.  You like old school candy.  That's horrible candy.  What's your favorite candy?  Pixie sticks with the sugar.  Good and plenty.  Good and plenty.  Anything?  Good and plenty strong.  You probably like Mary Jane.  I like hot tamales.  Hot tamales are very powerful.  Yeah, yeah.  What about Mary Jane?  Mary Jane's.  The red hot dots. 
[02:27:00]  You don't fucking suck.  Razzles were horrendous.  I like a razzle.  You like razzles?  I like a razzle.  Razzles are in the case.  Are they?  Is it a gum?  What is it?  Cigarette gum.  Cigarette gum.  Cigarette gum.  Cigarette gum.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, yeah.  It's all good for my training.  I want to kill my fucking friend.  I go, all I talk about is training for this fucking special.  Yeah.  And they say, he goes, well, I think it'll be good for you.  It'll give you energy.  Yeah.  I go, no.  A protein drink will give me fucking energy.  Sure.  This will kill me.  Sure.  I'm a box of dots.  Bad enough of them smoking fucking cigarettes as a training method. 
[02:27:30]  You're smoking nonstop, too, guys.  Cigarettes and dots.  Which means so are we.  I'm into it.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're not.  We're not into it.  I got nicotine gum going and with this cigarette.  Oh, man.  I actually am nostalgic for cigarettes.  I like sitting around with the smoke a little bit.  What are you doing in New York?  I did a thing.  I did a live podcast out in Brooklyn yesterday.  Oh, really?  How'd that go?  It was all right.  It was a festival.  There were drunk ladies who like it.  Right when I come out, they're both like, ah!  And they're holding up drinks, pointing at them.  Oh, great.  I get it.  You got a problem. 
[02:28:00]  Shut up.  You know, I don't mind when they get a little buzz.  You know, it's once they get fucking sloppy.  It's horrible.  Yeah.  And then they come up to you after, like they helped you.  Oh, the fucking assholes.  We love you.  We love you.  That's why we ruined your show.  And I love women.  I just love, I don't like asshole women.  Like, I could deal with an asshole guy, but I can't deal with an asshole woman.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Especially if they're half decent looking and then they're sloppy.  You know, like when they go to the clubs and they're walking around without the fucking 
[02:28:30]  shoes on with that dirty fucking feet.  How many times did that happen?  Yeah, shoes off.  You're thinking about feet so dirty.  What's our fucking gash going to smell like this fucking slob?  But did that happen more than once with the shoes?  Yeah, what's with the shoes?  All the time.  Because I'm in Vegas a lot, so I go out a lot.  Oh, they come in their sweatpants.  They see these fucking, they walk in all like, look at me, you know, I'm the next  Kardashian.  Yeah.  You know, I go, really, did you show any feature film yet? 
[02:29:00]  Then they take their shoes off?  You know, that's one thing that always got me about that girl.  Kim?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because I like the show and everything, but I was always thinking like, why'd she give  up such a great film career?  She was so good in that fucking movie because when you're going taking balls deep from somebody,  you know, I know how it is to shoot a movie and I'm going, she's a fucking  natural.  You know what I mean?  She was gagging on it.  She was fucking it.  Like she's done a hundred of these things.  And I'm going, okay, your show is great, you know, but give us some more movies. 
[02:29:30]  Don't forget about the movie career.  Yeah.  Forget the name of the movie, but it's fucking great.  It's action.  Hey, are you keeping away from the tables in Vegas?  Sometimes.  You're trying?  Yeah.  When I play now, it's just, you know, for a few dollars.  We've all heard the stories.  Well, yeah, it's a system, right?  Well, the system is I win or lose.  That's the system.  And normally it's the lose.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Me and Kenny took many of what we call the loser walk. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, yeah.  One night from Caesar's Palace to Bally's, like we lost, we lost.  I lost like a half a million dollars and we took what we called the loser's walk.  Oh, my God.  I remember being blamed for one of those losses when we were doing the, it was like the Venetian  and apparently you weren't having a good night.  And Kenny goes, Andrew would like you to leave because he thinks you're a jinx.  I was like, but I'm not.  I think I did that to you once, too.  You might have.  I think I was like, Kenny, he's got to go.  So he's the cooler? 
[02:30:30]  You're the cooler, Kenny.  My hatred of losing, I can't gamble at all because I cannot, I don't get a rush from it.  I can't stand losing any money.  All it is is about the money for me.  I don't care about the rush.  I don't care about the game.  It's just about winning money.  I don't care if the dealer drops fucking dead.  I'll just grab a ton of chips and run away.  I don't care.  You don't get a rush from it?  Not really.  No, it's not the rush.  It's just about the money.  I like to win like in one or two shoes and then just go and shop. 
[02:31:00]  You can walk away from it?  Yeah, that I could do.  We've got to ask you about Travolta.  What happened?  You're hearing about the male masseurs coming out of the closet.  Oh, yeah, I heard a little something about that.  Coming out of the closet, I guess.  Yeah.  Oh, he's actually saying it?  No, he's not, but we're all thinking it at this point.  But, you know.  Allegations.  And I bring it up because you do a great Travolta.  I love allegations.  I can't believe how his dick got in my face.  I mean, I'm just laying there enjoying a nice little back massage. 
[02:31:30]  And next thing, I feel a cock on my neck.  That's what you wanted.  Can you do a Travolta?  Uh-huh.  I just do the basic, you know, all right, all right, I'm bored with it, all right?  You know.  That's all right.  Saturday Night Fever.  I just see the Night Fever guy.  Yeah, but you're not turning into him.  You're not becoming.  No, I can't do that.  You become John Travolta. 
[02:32:00]  You want us to turn the lights down or are you good?  No, I'm good.  I'm good.  Two's good.  Two's good.  You take Clay away?  See, he becomes Travolta.  You become Travolta.  I just.  No, but I always loved that.  Who gives a fuck what he does?  You don't care, right?  No, who gives a fuck?  Who gives a fuck?  Who gives a fuck?  I heard he was sucking Kinnicky's dick.  You heard that one, right?  I never heard that one.  I didn't hear any of this.  They're saying he woke Kinnicky up with a blowjob and like when they were Jeff Conway  woke up because Travolta was born in a blowjob. 
[02:32:30]  I was saying the same thing.  Right.  You know, for the first 10 minutes, you don't know who it is.  Who cares?  Right, right.  Your eyes are still shut.  You know, saliva in a tongue, saliva in a fucking tongue.  What the fuck?  And if that's what makes him happy, then so be it.  Who gives a fuck?  I like that.  Dice isn't making any judgments on this thing.  Of course not.  No, Travolta is one of our greats and then the media looks to knock him down.  This shit was talked about 20 years ago.  Who gives a fuck?  Just a quick question.  Do we want the Game of Thrones guy for a few minutes today?  Oh, when? 
[02:33:00]  You do Games of Thrones?  We were on a roll.  I'm just saying.  I don't watch that show.  We're doing an interview.  This is a professional interview.  You're supposed to be my friend.  I am your friend.  I love you.  You're supposed to be my friend.  If it's possible.  And now it's a whole stop.  Now it's a whole thing.  Now it's a whole thing.  Your word looks good, too.  You lost a lot of weight.  You want to do it?  It's unreal.  I can give up the mic here.  No, no, no.  I just got it.  Mark, what the fuck is going on now?  The guy's got a sword, right?  But what's this in the news?  We're good.  We're good.  What's this in the news with Johnny T?  Yeah, yeah.  It was some will or something. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, a suicide note.  Yeah, Conway's suicide note from 2006.  From 2006 when he tried to off himself.  What did Ronald say?  Some are lovin'.  Hand me a blast.  Some are lovin'.  Got some boy ass.  Yeah, see?  See, I could make it a joke.  That was beautiful.  But leave the fucking guy alone.  Leave the guy alone, yeah.  Leave the guy alone.  You like the Bee Gees?  I can't. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, that guy, he does, too, right?  Yeah, Robin Gibb.  How many are left?  There's only one Bee Gees, right?  Two.  Two?  They voted Stayin' Alive as the number one Bee Gees song.  Yeah.  I agree.  They saw it on television last night.  I don't know.  I think that's the one people know the most.  I don't know if it's one of them.  What about one of their old songs?  No, what they said with the Bee Gees, like, that's what's always gonna be remembered.  What about You Should Be Dancing?  I like the old one.  What about it?  That's a good one.  You like the real old one, like Lonely Days, Lonely Nights?  Yeah, yeah.  I like that song.  That shit's great. 
[02:34:30]  Love that song.  Yeah.  It's almost like Beatles-y.  That's what we said earlier.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You had a little Beatles-y up on for a while.  You just got done with the other one.  No, I want to see how long I could go.  Normally, I hold an unlit cigarette.  How long are you back on them?  For a year.  Okay.  Do you want to go back off?  No, it gives you the energy.  Have a couple cigarettes, get on the treadmill.  They yell at me in the gym, but I'm like, this is how I do it.  You smoke on the treadmill?  Yeah.  I got them little cups for ashtrays.  I think that's for fluids. 
[02:35:00]  They make treadmills great.  That's for water.  There's one for water and one for an ashtray.  Yeah, all right.  Yeah, and they always get mad.  You can't smoke in the air.  That would be hilarious watching him fucking running on the treadmill.  He makes his own rules.  I put it in the cup while I'm running.  Then I take a breather.  Oh, okay.  You take a breather, you smoke a little, and then you start running again.  The wine diet is great.  The wine diet.  Yeah, before you go.  A lot of calories in the wine.  No, but before you go running, you drink like two glasses of wine.  Yeah.  So it's like you don't even realize what you're doing, and you go like three, four miles. 
[02:35:30]  You know, that takes the pounds off.  There's logic there, Mark.  You know what I mean?  There really is logic there.  A little buzz before you go to the gym.  Yeah, you smoke a little pot.  You know what I mean?  What's up with this special?  What's going on?  The special's real exciting.  I'm doing it in Boston at the Wilbert Theater.  That's a great place.  August 24th.  Great place.  I call it my last special.  I want it to be the most exciting special I ever did.  And I've been going all over, working the material. 
[02:36:00]  I pulled some of the old hits, but a lot of the newer, you know, there's so much new stuff  with these fucking slobettes that are out there today.  Wait, you're not digging the girls these days?  What's that?  I got a wife.  Yeah, I know, but you can still look.  But you can still look at them.  Yeah, I look at them, and I see what fucking animals they are, you know, and.  Who in particular?  What do you mean?  Any, anyone sitting there.  Oh, just regular broads, too.  Now, what's your problem with them, though?  No, there is not.  I respect this generation more than any other generation, because years ago, when I would 
[02:36:30]  tell them what slobs they are, they would make believe they're not.  Today, they can't show you quick enough what kind of pigs they are.  Isn't that true?  Just by the way they dress, with the animal print, or a thong up her asshole lips.  You know what I mean?  They're trying to show you, this is what I am.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  So it's enjoyable when they're more, you know, aggressive like that.  Yeah.  You know, I talk to guys.  I talk to some friends in the business that go, it's unbelievable, Dice. 
[02:37:00]  You fucked this chick.  You know, and then you're like the girl that she doesn't even call you the next day.  That when you call her, she goes, I'll give you a buzz back if you've done everything imaginable.  This guy told me about a girl, and he goes, I'm fucking her in the ass.  And she looks back at me and goes, you know, I used to be real good at this.  I go, oh, what a shame.  She was a little rusty.  Well, after a pint of two fucking bulbs of fucking fluid, you know what I mean? 
[02:37:30]  She'll be all loosened up.  We'll get the rust out of her asshole.  I mean, it's just amazing how they even talk about that today.  Yeah.  It's true.  Like, you know, like, you used to be guys who talk about fucking, but now it's completely  demystified.  They don't know what to do with that fucking box.  All they do is, now the new thing is bedazzling.  You know what I mean?  Where they, like, put, like, almost like a disco ball effect down near that box.  How about dice rules and studs?  Yeah, I like that.  They should do that on the box.  If they're smart, they'll do that. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, yeah.  Chicks over 30 stay because they won't say they...  Dice came here.  Dice came here.  Yeah.  The chicks I've been with.  You know what I mean?  They won't text you photos of their pussies already.  The older girls suck.  Yeah, they will.  Nah, fucking chicks over 30 stink.  I like anyone between 20 and 25.  Yeah.  Because they don't mind giving the information.  Older girls are used to making you have to work for it.  Younger girls know to send texts, send photos.  The internet is much better.  Yeah, no, the internet is amazing.  But that's why I get amazed when people, like, point the fingers at people that have 
[02:38:30]  done little sexual things in the news.  Like, they never did, you know, send pictures of their cock, cunt, or tits.  You know what I mean?  And, you know, when you're like, here's the package, do you want to siphon it?  Yeah, yeah.  That's how I look at it.  That's how the woman who, uh...  You know, but when they get caught, oh, he's such a big man.  In the meantime, he's spitting his fucking thick piss all over town.  Thick piss.  Whatever the fuck you want to call the thick piss.  The girl I live with sent me a picture of her pussy. 
[02:39:00]  You know, the bulkier piss.  That was it.  That was what made it work.  Like, when I first met this girl, she sent me, like, it was on the fence about it.  Wow.  Got the pussy picture.  And now we're living together.  Was it a nice one?  Yeah, of course.  And you know what?  I respect that, because...  That's how they say hi today.  You know, guys...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, well, not the younger guys, but guys like my age or a little younger, they judge  them.  Like, if a chick fucks them on the first night, which is what you want.  Right.  It's the aim.  The minute you pick up a chick, you're thinking, how long till I can unleash this fucking seven 
[02:39:30]  day load on her?  You know what I mean?  Sure.  Because I don't know about you, but I like to get it constantly out.  Just keep cleaning it out.  Do you save up, though?  Give them the fresh stuff.  You save up, though?  You'll go three days just to make it bigger?  Well, you know what?  If I'm on the road, because, you know, I'm still like a newlywed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, and my wife is Latino, so it's a fucking constant.  I can't.  Are you kind of bummed, I said, you're missing out on all this pussy out there? 
[02:40:00]  Missing out?  You see my wife?  I know.  You got a problem with my wife?  Oh, shit.  Very nice girl.  You got to come down on my wife?  I didn't mean it like that.  I got to be a full lot at all.  Shit.  No, but that's what I'm saying.  But I'm saying.  You know what I mean?  I don't like anybody calling her fucking names.  But that's what you say.  You know what I mean, Norm?  She's a very nice girl.  Yeah, she's a nice girl.  I understand.  I picked what I wanted to pick.  I got what I want.  So that's where the loads go.  In a different world.  And that's it.  In a different world.  No, you know how I put it, Anthony?  I'll put it to you this way.  All right.  Because, you know, you walk around Manhattan, you see them all walking around. 
[02:40:30]  Exactly.  Each one, they're just so desperate.  They can't show enough fucking, here's my tits.  Here's my fucking box lips.  Right.  Here's an imprint of my asshole against my jeans.  You know what I mean?  So my whole thing has always been, you've got to be happy with what you're laying next  to.  That's it.  So if you're happy with that, who cares about looking at all the other slobs?  That just helps nurture the load.  Build the load.  Like you would say.  Nurture the load.  You've got to call your new special, then. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  Build the load.  Build the fucking load.  Nurture the load.  Nurture the load is good.  I'm not sure of the name of the special.  Go nurture the load.  Nurture the load.  We like that.  Tickets are on sale this Friday.  TheWilbur.com.  T-H-E-W-I-L-B-U-R.com.  It's two shows on a Friday at 7 o'clock, and I'm going to guess at 10 or at 11 o'clock,  whatever.  Oh, is there only one?  It says Showtime.  Is it 7?  No, we're going to...  Is that it?  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  We might have one show on sale.  No, I think what might happen, you know, a second show will be added. 
[02:41:30]  No, we'll probably do two shows.  That's what I'm thinking.  We're shooting a special.  But don't assume that.  Get your tickets starting Friday for the Wilbur Theater.  7 p.m.  August 24th.  It will be exciting.  Actually, my boys are doing the special with me.  Fucking A.  You know, because Dylan now got back into the whole guitar thing.  That's like three years ago when you played that.  That show was good, man.  And then he went to high school, built his body, did the water polo, and now he's ready  to rock again.  How's Max's stand-up?  Max is doing...  Well, let Mark talk about it.  He had him on the show.  Great guy.  You know, he respects the craft. 
[02:42:00]  He's not cocky.  He's paying his dues.  He's doing his work.  Nice.  He loves his dad.  It's beautiful.  Yeah, he'll do like three sets a night at the showcase clubs, and then now and then  he gets to open for me so we get some real audiences.  And he's trying not to do you, right?  No, he doesn't do me, but I love when he gets mad on stage.  Because, you know, my audience has got to be the most aggressive crowds I've ever seen.  So somebody's always going to yell something, and then Max gets quiet, and then comes the  storm.  Because it's like Max mean when he gets like that, and he doesn't care. 
[02:42:30]  He'll just say anything to him.  That's when it really happens, right?  Because, for me, there's no hold.  You say and do what the fuck you've got to do and kill him.  Do they know he's your son when he goes up or no?  Well, he does a whole bit on being Dice's son.  Oh, man.  Are they harder on him, or are they nicer?  Um, no, he doesn't do that bit till the end.  Oh, okay.  That's his closing bit, actually.  And what do you think of that?  I love it.  It's hysterical.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, the one thing I tell him about stand-up, I go, as long as there's some truth to what 
[02:43:00]  you're saying, it's going to be funny.  Because an audience can always feel when you're just making the shit up.  So make it truthful.  Just put that twist on it to make it funny.  And he's doing it.  He's doing great with it.  So father-son moments are when he really loses his shit, and he's almost at the end of his  rope, and he just lays someone out in the audience.  No, I love what he's talking about.  Right.  That's what I mean.  You're like, that's my boy.  That's my boy.  Yeah.  Yeah, because he's smart enough to, like, pick on the person that's happening and use  what that guy is.  Yeah.  Like, let's say the guy's, like, 60 years old, and you go, oh, that's nice. 
[02:43:30]  You're an adult picking on a boy?  You know, he makes it really bad for the guy, you know?  In the meantime, last time Max was in Vegas, he had this fucking chick that was sitting  in the front, this 21-year-old girl that, you know, I started questioning her, because  she had tits.  Uh-huh.  You know?  Sure.  You know, and I'm going, hey, Max, I think I got one for you here.  Next thing you know, here he comes backstage.  Dad, can you take a picture with her? 
[02:44:00]  And she was like this fetishist model.  Ooh.  Yeah.  So the next day, like, I don't ask him what he did exactly, but he was at least smart  enough, what happened is he's with the chick in his room, and, you know, it's starting  to happen, and he realizes he doesn't have condoms, right?  So he asked the girl, he goes, you got any on you?  And she's like, no.  He goes, but this is what you do.  You know what I mean?  You know?  You know?  You have a little package. 
[02:44:30]  So he knows if he leaves the room, it's over.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So he calls down to the front desk to get, like, a bellhop to go get him condoms.  That's resourceful.  Yeah, it was, and then the next day, he goes, Dad, greatest night of my fucking life.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  And I knew it would be.  I would actually call the bellhop to have him remove the condoms from my room.  I can't wear them.  I hate you fucking wilts.  Is that a new thing with you?  No, since fucking 1985, I haven't been able to put one on.  That's gambling. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  That's true.  I don't wear bags.  He doesn't wear bags.  I don't believe in the bags.  They're terrible.  They're terrible.  They're an awful fucking thing.  You're going to have more kids' dice.  I don't know.  I don't know.  She wants them, though, right?  Oh, shit.  You know what?  She doesn't hammer me about that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right now, she knows, like, you know, what I'm doing and what I'm building up to.  So, you know, she's just into that.  I get that all the time.  My girlfriend's 28.  She's like, when are you going to put a baby in me?  Wow.  I don't know.  When are you going to put a baby in me?  When are you going to put a baby in me?  Yeah.  When I can open it up that one and stuff on in. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, I'll try that one.  Why isn't she here today, Dice?  My wife?  Yeah.  Because we were up till five.  Right.  You know what goes on.  It's newlywed shit.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  And I said, look, I'll just go do the radio show and you just sleep.  You guys still fucking a lot like that?  Yeah?  Like newlyweds?  Well, why are you going to say it's so crass?  Oh, my God.  The crass?  The crass? 
[02:46:00]  Be nice.  Could you be polite?  I'm sorry.  Dice has to shake it.  Have some respect for the woman.  What's the problem?  With smoking, you have to shake it.  Yeah, so what?  It might be on fire.  I'm brewing it.  So what?  I'm brewing it.  Dice has a cigarette smoldering in a cup.  In a paper cup.  So what?  Yeah, I don't have a cup, right.  They don't even last like they used to.  No.  They burn really quick, right?  No, we have an incredible sex life.  We really do.  That's good.  That's what I meant.  I didn't mean to get crass about it.  It's unique.  You just put one out.  So what?  You said you weren't going to try to?  I'm cutting back. 
[02:46:30]  I'm having the lights.  Kenny, tell them, please.  I forgot how it was to breathe and smoke.  Did you use to smoke Marlboro lights?  Yeah, but Marlboro lights are harder than these.  Kenny brought up a great job.  I actually want to quit soon again.  Did you just decide that?  No, no.  I've been building up to quit.  They know.  They know.  Didn't I just quit and just stop for 10 years?  Dice Kenny?  Dice Kenny had a great story about how you would smoke in the airports and stuff.  And then when people would question you about your smoking, they were told that you had 
[02:47:00]  a waiver from the governor.  Yeah.  And they can't check that.  It's a true story.  They're like, I have a waiver from the governor.  And they'd be like, oh, all right.  Yeah, where is it?  It's in a frame.  Can you get Roland in here?  Roland's hating the cigarette smoke.  Oh, Roland's going crazy.  I forgot how it was like to breathe this shit in.  I know.  It's been years.  You've got to do what you've got to do.  But this was everywhere.  I don't know when.  This was everywhere.  You forgot.  Back in the day.  I mean, like in an airplane.  This was what you had. 
[02:47:30]  In an airplane.  I used to smoke in the back of airplanes.  Sporting events.  Elementary school.  I loved it.  I loved smoking in an airplane.  It was the greatest.  Because you had the back four rows.  It was you and another guy coughing.  And you're just sitting there smoking.  It was beautiful.  The whole plane got smoky anyway.  And when it first started flying, you could smoke anywhere in the plane.  Roland, how bad is it in here?  Because we've been in here a while.  It smells like an old Vegas casino.  Yeah, he's up to about six cigarettes easier.  Just leave.  Just leave.  There's the door.  Leave.  He's coughing.  But it's amazing how weird it is.  Go do some hooper. 
[02:48:00]  I can barely see Dice at this point.  The asshole's going to a bar to be there.  Look at the smoke in there.  Isn't that what that shit is?  Like air?  There's the Hooper lounges.  The Hooper lounges.  The Hooper lounges.  Hooper.  Hookah.  Hookah.  Hookah.  I got oxygen.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  I got oxygen, but I don't have cigarettes.  Well, the Hooper bars, they put like tobacco and fruits and all kinds of dried flowery things.  And they can smoke that.  Yeah, they put a brick of coal on it.  It's tobacco.  It's tobacco.  Yeah, and then there's oxygen bars where you just sit there and have oxygen. 
[02:48:30]  That's a racket.  That sounds like a fucking blast.  Not quite, huh?  Honey, want to go out tonight and breathe?  Asshole ideas that they come up with.  Oxygen.  I was watching a show last night.  They had a hospital scene and someone's smoking in the hospital.  People smoked everyone.  Not even in the waiting room or anything.  They're in the hallway of the hospital.  In the operating room.  The doctor's looking at a chart and he's smoking.  They really sold a bill of goods with the cigarettes. 
[02:49:00]  I mean, I never thought about it, but it's weird when someone lights up because it's so unheard of.  You're like, oh my God, it used to all be like this.  I love the fucking smell.  Yeah, it's like in Papa Greenwich Village.  When the father's smoking in the hospital, he had a heart attack.  Yeah.  And Eric Roberts is going, come on, Pop, you're in a hospital.  Oh, you're just like your fucking mother.  That's a great Eric Roberts.  Who does Eric Roberts?  I've done that like in years.  You used to do a bunch of them.  I remember those.  Jerry Lewis and then the Travolta and then the De Niro and then the Pacino. 
[02:49:30]  Sometimes you've got to whack him, Charlie.  You've got to say you put your coat on and you don't say goodnight to nobody.  That's great.  Paulie, what'd you do, Paulie?  That's a good one.  Goddamn.  You can't do that either?  No, I don't do that one at all.  So the only one you do is basically me.  Just, yeah.  I do dice and that's it.  And you do phenomenal.  I'm always getting the reports.  Anthony said this.  Reports.  Anthony said this to a guy when he said this. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah.  What'd you say to that guy last week?  I don't remember.  I was sick.  It was probably a throwaway.  My throat's all like grainy now.  I can't do any impressions.  So it's not the working cough.  Well, I was.  He was really sick.  I can't get sick.  I've got to do shows.  And you shouldn't be in here now.  Come near me.  He had the whooping cough.  That's a six-week cough.  I don't know what the fuck that is.  I don't believe in those kind of things.  That's like 1800s.  I had like a 24-hour cold.  I got rid of it.  Oh, sick?  Good for you.  Cigarettes.  No, I just got rid of it.  I don't know what happened. 
[02:50:30]  Cigarettes did that.  They got rid of the cold.  It cures a lot of shit.  It does.  You need it to make room for the cancer.  Oh, shut up.  I'm like, oh, I'm so old.  We worry about you.  Believe me, I live to be an old prick.  Believe me.  What else is up with Dice?  You got the big special.  That's exciting.  Special's going to be exciting.  And that's how I want to make it.  I want it to be really exciting.  Should we all go out for this or what?  And it's going to...  You should.  You got a little VIP area for us?  Yeah.  A balcony seat somewhere in there?  Have you been to that theater?  It's great.  Put some seats aside. 
[02:51:00]  Farwin A and Norton and Marin.  I'll go in a second.  And Kenny.  It's Friday, August 24th.  I just want to promote it again.  Wilbur Theater.  Tickets go on sale Friday, May 25th.  One show right now.  Maybe two.  Where'd you do your special?  Cleveland at the Ohio Theater.  How was that?  It was good.  The first show I didn't like.  It was too well lit.  And I made them dark in the room for the second show.  And the second show was great.  It's edited and ready to go.  I'm very happy.  What was it?  Like a thousand seat?  That type of room?  Yeah, with camera kills about 900.  Yeah, that's what I'm going to do.  I want to like.  I like the Wilbur because it's got like that rock and roll feel. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah.  It's also got that balcony.  It's beautiful.  Because all these specials I see, they look too pretty.  Yeah.  You know, with big chandeliers.  And there's a guy on stage going, motherfucker.  I want to fuck you in the ass and shit.  I'm going, it's a gorgeous chandelier in the room.  You can't say that with chandeliers.  No, I can't.  I want it to have that fucking look.  I want it to be like more of a rock comedy show.  Beacon Theater.  You know, and Boston's perfect.  Boston was always a great market for me.  And like I said, I don't really want to do another special after this.  I think it's enough.  I want to tour a lot and do everything else I'm doing. 
[02:52:00]  But I'm actually going to be coming out with a book from David Ritz that did, you know,  Marvin Gaye and the Ray Charles movie.  You know, the movie was made from that book.  Yeah, yeah.  And George Gallo's writing the screenplay.  Could you see a Dice movie?  Yeah, the Dice movie.  George Gallo, the comic?  No, George Gallo, the writer.  He did Midnight Run.  You would know that.  What's the book?  Is it an autobiography?  Yeah, autobiographical.  Yeah.  And this guy's really great. 
[02:52:30]  So that's what's going on now.  Well, now we've got to ask you, who would you like to play Dice in a movie?  Well, I actually met with James Franco about it.  Oh, really?  You know, yeah, we had like a three-hour meeting about it, but that was like a year and a half  ago.  And, you know, he's amazing because by the time he left my room, besides being a nervous  wreck, you know, he was actually doing me because he's a method guy, you know, but he  wasn't doing Dice.  He was doing me, and I'm watching how he's moving it.  It was like, yeah.  Really?  You know, and the guy's like, well, you know, if I do this, we got to live together. 
[02:53:00]  I got to see everything you do.  Wow.  Yeah.  I mean, he's really good.  Well, you got to really learn.  He knows what I do on stage, but he's got to learn, like, what you guys know.  So he's going to be standing there in the bedroom going, that's how you do it?  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  He'll learn.  It's not what he thinks.  No.  No, it's not.  Wait till he sees with the candy.  Yeah.  What do you mean?  I got to eat a gobstopper.  And the giant sweats.  And the big socks. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Big things of honey.  Like I was going to come up here with these giant sweats on.  And my wife's like, no.  You know how Norton gets about this.  She brought you up.  She goes, like, he'll think you're, like, in the pajamas again.  And he'll say, you're three years old.  You know what he does.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because he can never take that on the road.  It's just comfortable, though, right?  Yeah.  I like being comfortable.  Because on stage, you've got to be in the tight jeans and a tight shirt.  And I hate it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wish I could just go out there in pajamas. 
[02:54:00]  What are you wearing on the special?  I'm going to go all black this time.  Jacket.  No, but I mean just all black, no jewelry, just very rock and roll.  Oh, nice.  You know what I mean?  That's how I want it to be.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah, yeah.  A jacket or no?  You know, more of a vest leather, you know, that I had made for you.  Who makes them for you?  It's not light, believe me.  This guy, Jeff Hamilton, he's made all, like, my famous dice jackets.  So he does all that.  The studded one, the big one?  Yeah, he's like an artist, you know, and he just knows how to do it. 
[02:54:30]  You discuss the concept and then, you know, three weeks later, it's perfect.  Has he made any you didn't like or said, no, fix this?  There have been a couple times through the years where we had to make adjustments, but  he's really the best.  I mean, he's like the greatest.  How do you meet a guy like that?  You know how I met him?  When I did my first guy, Kenny, you remember when we did Town Hall?  And, um, is Kenny in the room?  No.  But he's listening.  I guarantee you.  There was this jacket that George Michael wore in one of his videos years ago with a 
[02:55:00]  big eagle on the back.  Yeah, yeah.  And when I was going to do Town Hall, I was down, like, in the village, and I saw that  jacket.  So, you know, I come over to the, you know, they want the, like, 900 for the jacket.  And I go, you know, I'm paying cash.  So you want the dice, the dice deals.  Yeah, I want, like, the pro deal.  Right, right, right.  So the guy goes, no, you know, we get these on consignment.  So I had him call, you know, the guy so I could get a deal, and it was Jeff Hamilton. 
[02:55:30]  And he started laughing on the phone.  He's like, you want a deal on this?  You know?  I go, yeah, you know, you know, the jacket's, you know, 900.  He goes, well, you know, it's the village.  It's expensive.  And I'm like, yeah, but the village don't know.  The jacket don't know it's the village.  You know what I mean?  And then when I came back to L.A., you know, that's when we discussed it.  How much did you get it for?  I got it for five.  But I told him I'll give him all business.  Dice will negotiate everything, you know. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  And that was the beginning of the relationship.  Yeah, and that was the beginning.  And then he never gave me a break on a jacket again.  He got you back, I'm sure.  But I don't blame him because the jackets are like pieces of art the way he makes them.  You got them all still?  You save them all?  Yeah, I got them all.  The Dice Rules, the Dice Man Comet jacket, the MTV jacket, all the ones that got me in trouble.  The ones from the 80s must look pretty damn funny.  Yeah.  Big shoulders.  No, they're great, but that's the look.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like the gladiator of comedy type of look. 
[02:56:30]  They're pretty timeless, who have their jackets, usually.  Yeah, you got to have a certain look, and, you know, I got to look a certain way for the fans.  Yeah, but Dice had some that aren't quite as timeless.  You know, the one with the, it was like almost pointed on the shoulders and had the stripes on it.  Which one was that?  I don't know.  That's the MTV jacket?  MTV jacket.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It is timeless.  I was wearing animal prints before women were wearing animal prints. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I started that shit.  But it would be hard to wear it now and not have people turn and stare.  Why would it be hard to wear it now?  It's a time we're slow.  That's the whole idea of being an entertainer, that people stare.  Oh.  Don't you get that part?  That's a good point.  You make that nice.  Yeah, you go on stage, you want them to fucking stare.  Right.  You know, he makes a point.  Why did you ask?  I don't know.  I was just.  People are going to stare at you.  That's the whole thing.  That's what you want, right? 
[02:57:30]  Yeah.  Anybody could wear just a black motorcycle jacket and go on stage.  I want people to know.  Okay.  Well, I got you now.  I went to Lentz.  But you wouldn't put that vest on now and go out and do your special.  Well, why not?  People would stare.  No, they would just go.  But they would think like.  He wore that jacket already.  Oh, you think that's what they would say?  Yeah.  So you wear a different jacket.  Well, you wouldn't wear a similar jacket because it's a little outrageous in the 80s.  They're all similar.  And what do I care if it's 80s?  What do I got to be?  2012? 
[02:58:00]  No, but you don't want.  I don't think 80s.  Well, you don't want people equating what you're doing to back then.  You're doing something new now.  They're not because of the material.  Well, that's just it.  But the first.  Do you understand?  But the first impression would be.  The material isn't the 80s.  Well, maybe one or two bigs.  I understand.  Once I get into the newer shit, they're going, okay, he looks 80s, you know, but he talks  like from the 40s.  Exactly.  See, I was just thinking because the first impression would be like, oh, he's wearing that getup. 
[02:58:30]  You know, maybe.  Get up?  Well, yeah.  What do you mean get up?  It's not a get up.  Yeah.  It was kind of a get up.  It's stage clothing at the time.  Was it kind of a get up?  A little bit of a get up.  What did you get to wear to go to work?  I know, shit.  Nobody even sees what you're fucking wearing.  It's radio, though.  Yeah.  It's garbage.  Yeah.  Well, then get on the back of a garbage truck and start loading the fucking bag.  No, this is because it's radio.  No one sees.  I don't give a shit.  But they do see.  You got a guy with a fucking camera.  You got to look a certain way. 
[02:59:00]  That's because you're here today.  You got to make a whole fucking presentation.  We don't get this every day.  You don't be sure, right?  Look at my nice shirt.  Yeah, it is a nice shirt.  Nice, right?  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  And this guy comes in like he just got done doing the plumbing in his fucking house.  He's got a Cayman Island shirt.  And I'm not pissing on it.  Don't get me wrong.  I don't mind the way you dress.  He looks relaxed.  Thank you.  Yeah, I'm relaxed.  He's all relaxed.  You know, if I was doing a radio show, I'd dress like this.  Just like this.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, you don't have a jacket on today.  So you got to be...  No, I got a leather.  Oh, you do?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's your just bummer on my friend.  That's the casual leather? 
[02:59:30]  Built in.  This is the rain leather.  Oh, right.  Is it raining?  This takes the rain.  Yeah, it's a shitty day today.  Shitty out.  Shitty.  Liquid grime.  This is a day for eating, smoking, and banging.  That's it, huh?  Yeah.  Where do you eat when you're in New York?  In my room.  Yeah.  You like the room service?  No, no.  We go for it.  We go for it.  We go to the big sandwich place.  Hotel you're at.  You got to hit the delis.  Why don't we go to the Carnegie later?  I never hear from you anymore.  You got to hit...  What do you mean?  I never hear from...  I text dice every time I'm in L.A. 
[03:00:00]  Hey, buddy, I'm in town.  You know what?  You know I normally get in touch with you.  This has been a really crazy week.  It's a newlywed thing.  I want to go to Carnegie.  I started off with Westbury.  Then I had to do this insane comedy club.  Carnegie Deli.  And then the Bamboozle last night.  What's that?  The Rock Festival.  I don't know.  You guys are in the know.  We had to sleep.  This is a radio show.  We had to sleep last night.  Where was the Bamboozle?  It's the biggest rock show in the country.  That's all.  Is it AC?  Where is it?  I went on before...  No, at Asbury Park. 
[03:00:30]  I went on before the Bon Jovi show.  Wow.  Yeah, it was great.  What's the Bamboozle?  Why don't...  I don't know about it.  Why are we out?  I'm an idiot.  You don't know what Bamboozle...  Callers!  Call in!  And tell this fucking guy what Bamboozle is.  Is Springsteen down there?  Who the fuck knows?  I live with him.  The fuck do I care?  I don't even know what he sings about anymore.  I live with him.  Bon Jovi was down there, though.  Who else?  Yeah, Bon Jovi.  Who else did you see or know?  Buck Cherry came to my show.  Buck Cherry's all right.  He's good.  Some guys from, uh... 
[03:01:00]  It's sort of fucking thing.  Yeah.  They're good.  Another band.  Is that the name of the band?  I forgot the name of the band.  But I go on a lot to the Buck Cherry Crazy Bitch song, you know.  So we're like fans of each other type of thing.  And now I'm going to do this...  You like the Killers?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm doing a video for them.  An MTV video.  Good for you.  Yeah.  They're actually redoing a song from Pretty in Pink.  Which one?  Who the fuck knows?  Whatever it is.  I'm in it.  As long as I'm in it.  Yeah, I'm trying to remember the songs from Pretty in Pink. 
[03:01:30]  I don't even remember the songs.  Maybe Psychedelic Turn now.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's actually that next album.  It's like that hit song from the next album.  Good for you.  Wilbur Theater.  I want to keep promoting this.  Friday, August 24th.  Yeah, that's good for us, then I'm coming to get you.  We're going to have a car on sale Friday.  Hey, uh...  Friday or today?  Friday.  Friday.  How do you know?  It's right here.  Who said that?  Whoever typed this out.  Who the fuck did that?  Maybe they made a typo.  Oh, shit.  Maybe they're on sale today.  Well, you can try.  You can try today, but definitely Friday. 
[03:02:00]  You can try today.  Try today.  Definitely Friday.  Yeah, I guess if you call up and go, I want a dice ticket, they got it.  Yeah, they'll have it.  Showtime.  Showtime is putting this together.  Yeah, Showtime, New Year's Eve, it's going to air.  New Year's Eve, that's when it airs, yeah.  I'm going to have it air at 12.13 a.m.  Why 13?  Because it's 2013.  Oh.  So you get people...  I didn't catch that.  You know what?  At New Year's...  It kind of makes sense.  You know what?  At New Year's, when you do that New Year's suck-off, and you're sitting at the couch, 
[03:02:30]  and you stick a head on your brick and bump it up and down.  And then, after you blow your load all over her, you just sit back and go, dice is coming  on now.  You got time.  It's like the warm-up.  It's like load one of the New Year.  It's perfect.  Load one.  By 12.  I like that.  Load one of the New Year.  They should name that, like, to a space shuttle or something.  Load one.  Oh.  People hear the Zippo of the radio.  Oh, he's smoking like a motherfucker. 
[03:03:00]  How many cigarettes are you up there?  I like five.  He's still got it.  He's still got it.  I've been smoking nonstop.  Guys, Foo Fighters were down there.  I can't breathe.  The Foo Fighters were down there.  Foo Fighters were there.  I didn't know that.  Everybody was there.  Everybody.  Did you do that?  Everybody.  There were 40,000 people.  Yeah, that's...  Man.  That's kind of impressive.  How long was your show?  I did the shortest show I could.  Four hours and 15 minutes.  No, no.  I did, like, an hour.  I did an hour.  Regular set.  That's short for you. 
[03:03:30]  You know?  No, not really.  You know, I'm really sticking to really forming the set I'm going to do, because I really  want it just to annihilate the crowd from beginning to end.  You know?  Was it music crowd, or were they there for you?  No, they were there for me.  That's good.  They were there.  Music crowd's tough.  Sometimes.  When they're just there for you.  Yeah, but I'm a rock and roll comic, so I bring to the table that kind of vibe.  Did you curb the salty language?  Oh, I got to tell you what was happening, though, because they let anybody in. 
[03:04:00]  So about seven minutes into the show, I see, like, people getting up and leaving with children.  Oh, shit.  They were letting, like, seven-year-old kids in there.  What kind of asshole parents bring their fucking kids to a dice show?  You know, even if you like what I do, you know what I do.  Why would you want your kid to get this fucking filth?  Yeah.  These asshole humans that have kids today.  Fucking women are so dumb.  They fucking have kids three weeks later. 
[03:04:30]  I want to go back to work.  Yeah, and who's going to bring up the kid?  Yeah.  You know, they're an important job at the bake shop, you know what I mean?  You know what I mean?  Or in the library going, shh.  That's real important.  Instead of bringing up your kids, these fucking assholes.  You know what?  You know what I tell women?  You know, if it's going to come out of your twat, fucking bring it up.  If not, just keep sucking fucking dick.  If you want to be in the library going, shh, assholes. 
[03:05:00]  They want kids almost like it's a possession.  There's some weird logic in that.  There's great logic in it, you know?  They're yelling at the husbands, you've got to stay home.  I fucking work.  I take care of us.  I put a roof over our head.  What do you do?  Bake lemon poppy seed muffins?  Fucking moron.  Dice is from 1945.  Dice is from 1945.  Dice is a kid.  Let me tell you something about my kids.  You never diapered.  I didn't even talk to them until they were two. 
[03:05:30]  You know, you know.  I ain't staying there and wiping shit.  That's a maternal thing.  Yeah.  How old were they when they saw you for the first time, Duke stand-up?  Like, when they let them.  Well, actually, that time when we did the garden, you know, they were six and ten.  Oh, man.  And they didn't get to see all of it.  How old are they now?  You know what I mean?  Dillon's going to be 18.  Max is going to be 22.  Oh, God.  We're all.  What happened?  What happened?  What that happened?  Did you have to explain to them what you were talking about at some point?  Well, I would explain that it's really, you know, adult language. 
[03:06:00]  And they weren't allowed to watch the whole show.  Like, Dillon was only six.  So he was just able to watch me go on and then see the poems at the end.  And then they lock them up?  You just sort of.  But Max knew.  Oh, he lets them see the poems.  Max was.  Hickory dickory docked his chick was sucking my cock as a loud.  That's okay for him?  Yeah, but he's not thinking like that.  He just hears poems.  He's hearing these nice poems.  He just hears poems.  He just hears poems things.  Right, right, right.  He's not thinking about it.  And Max knew, like, when it would get too filthy, just go out of the back of the arena and hang with Kenny. 
[03:06:30]  Right, yeah.  You know what I mean?  He's a good babysitter.  He knew innately.  Like, when he started talking, he's like, I gotta go.  Yeah, when he'd hear the real bad language just out in the room and he'd come back.  Like, when he heard that this was really the part where the song got...  I just wanted them to see what it was like instead of if they...  But Jimmy's got something on this.  What tipped him off that it was going to be filthy was when he was talking about the consistency of the load needing to be chewed.  Would that be the part that was a sick, chunky...  What was that bit I used to do? 
[03:07:00]  Just how you cheat, hungry people.  You don't swallow my load.  You chew it.  Oh, Kenny knows.  Kenny.  Oh, Kenny.  How your cum is nutritious.  It's amazing.  Campbell's soup is going to box my cum as we speak.  That's the bit.  You don't know it, but he knows.  I'm pissed off at Campbell's because they backed out of the deal.  They did.  That's too bad.  I go, you put some salt with it.  That's all.  Some salt and pepper.  I love it.  It'll be delicious. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah, how you feeling?  Yeah, like cream of mushroom.  A crop dusting plane.  They catch you in the mouth like baby birds.  It's terrible.  Kenny remembers everything.  He really does know all the birds.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Kenny knows.  Holy shit.  You're amazing, Kenny.  No, I'm not.  Yeah, you are.  You're amazing, Kenny.  We love it.  And, of course, the amazing Andrew Dice Clay.  It's very exciting to be in here.  I haven't seen you guys in a while.  It's been a while.  Been a while.  What's going on with your kid?  How old's your kid?  Two.  Just turned two.  And she's having another one now? 
[03:08:00]  Maybe.  Two?  How old are you?  Maybe.  How old are you?  Do you talk about that?  How old are you?  How old are you going to talk about that?  Yeah, I'm in my 40s.  Upper 40s now.  I'll give you that much.  Well, because I don't have kids and she wants one and I'm thinking about it.  You've got to keep your shit together, I guess.  What do you mean?  Well, I'm going to keep my shit together, but should I have a kid or what?  That's up to you.  Why would you let him make the decision?  I'm not going to say like Anthony.  I'm not going to say that.  It's a life decision.  No, I know that, but I've been alive for 48 years and I haven't made the fucking decision.  And now I'm in a position where I've got to make a decision. 
[03:08:30]  I would say that.  But how long are you with the girl?  Like two years.  Well, Mark, let me ask you that.  Did you want kids growing up?  I always wanted kids.  I just fucking got through it late in my life.  I get panicky just thinking about it.  So you probably don't want to have a kid.  Do you think you've got at least another seven years with this chick?  No, I'd like to think that I could write it out, yeah.  Write it out.  That's one of the important parts.  No, I know.  I know.  I know.  No, I think that if I'm going to have a kid, she's 28.  This is the age that she's going to have it.  If I'm going to do it, I should do it now.  Do it.  You know what I mean? 
[03:09:00]  Is she putting pressure on you?  A little.  But not too bad.  A little.  Well, then you discuss it.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I just, it makes it like, what do you do with them?  I mean, I get worried.  How do you not worry about them?  Didn't you worry about them when they're babies?  Constantly.  It's a nightmare.  That part of it is a fucking nightmare.  My sister-in-law was just staying.  Kid was choking a little bit last night.  It's a fucking nightmare.  You never get over that.  I forgot what it was to have a little kid.  It's a nightmare.  My sister-in-law just spent like a month and a half with us. 
[03:09:30]  Right.  And she's got a two-year-old daughter.  And every time that kid ran, I was in a panic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Like, they're going to fall.  They're going to hit the head.  They're going to, I really panic.  Yeah, when people rent kids over my house, my house isn't baby-proofed.  I got fucking, like, knives on the corners of the tables.  Yeah.  Fucking guns are laying around the house.  I have fucking kids over the house.  It's dangerous over there.  If you can't get over that part, forget it.  Well, I think I have to do it, dude.  Are you with somebody steady now?  No.  Well, you just...  I'm a fucking animal now.  What do you think?  You are, right? 
[03:10:00]  Oh, pig.  I love that.  I'm a fucking pig.  You know what?  All right.  You've got to respect that in this world.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  So you're seeing what animals they are out there.  Oh, yeah.  Ann was married for 10 years.  Because it's almost like this whole generation grew up on porn, all these chicks.  I think that's true.  I think that's true.  They have all these porno sites with chicks.  You know, they just put pictures of their bleached-out asshole and their Brazilian wife,  and they're not making any money with this.  They're like, hey, look at this.  They feel like that's the right thing. 
[03:10:30]  I'm 19.  Here's my asshole.  Right.  Is that a good thing or bad?  I'm not clear.  I don't care.  I enjoy the pictures.  I think it's good, and I'm not against me.  That's one good thing about them.  I doubt it.  But, I mean, you know, it looks like if you're going to keep this girl, you've got to have  a kid.  Well, I don't want to wait much longer, because I don't want to be an old dad.  It looks like you don't want to have a kid.  No, I do.  I think I'd be a good dad.  I'm excited about it.  But, like I'm saying, I'm getting worried, and I don't even have the...  Like, if I picture having a kid, I'm like, holy shit, what if he, you know...  I get worried.  How old are you? 
[03:11:00]  I'm 48.  How many times are you going to ask him?  You said it 10 times.  I didn't hear the 48 part.  Just fucking do it.  All right.  Just do it.  People haven't...  Let me know how it works.  If you like it, maybe I'll give it another shot.  Okay.  We'll talk about it.  It's a nightmare, though.  Yeah, but I just had a couple friends that are like in their early 50s that had kids,  and it's just what's put upon them.  That's all I can't get over.  But it's like, really, how these women just put it all on the guy now.  What do you mean?  Yeah.  Believe me, when you have that kid, you think you're going to be doing your podcast, you 
[03:11:30]  know, feeding the baby and diapering him.  But that's what she said.  I'm telling them, it's like they don't fucking bring him up.  The minute they have him, oh, we need help.  Call your fucking mutter.  You know what I mean you need help?  Oh, it's cool.  You want to go, I need time for myself.  Then call your fucking mutter.  In the old days, they used to stay home with the kid.  That's what I'm talking about.  Now they want to run out and go, we don't have that instinct.  Guys don't have that nurturing thing. 
[03:12:00]  Like, you know, that's why they give chicks tits to feed the kid.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Things like that.  They come equipped.  But also people used to live closer to your family, too.  Like your grandmother would come.  Everybody would help out.  They'd bathe the kid.  You didn't do any of that.  You know what?  I would watch my wife bathe the kids.  But, you know, I don't like touching.  I like the kid.  You know?  I really don't.  You see, you know.  I like doing all that shit, to be honest with you.  I think that'd be part of it.  You've been brainwashed.  I'm wiping ass and shit.  I don't care. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  I'm all in.  It's brainwashing.  She did it to you leading up to having the kids.  Boy or girl?  Boy.  I'm just, you know.  You know, I'll go get what they need.  I'll go out.  I'll go to a fucking grocery.  Right.  I'll buy fucking stacks of diapers, stacks of formula.  That's your job.  Yeah.  And I'll put it in a fucking room and go, here, you're set for six months.  You got to go nowhere.  You don't wipe shit, though.  Here's frozen st...  No, I wouldn't do it.  You didn't wipe shit at all?  I couldn't do it.  It's just not my thing.  I don't believe in that. 
[03:13:00]  It's no one's thing.  I don't like wiping my own fucking ass.  Whose thing is that?  But you say it's not my thing.  It's no one's thing.  You shouldn't have to.  But no, women do it like it's beautiful.  They're not happy about it either.  Right, right.  It's second nature.  Yeah, they just do it.  They'll do it in front of anybody like they're not embarrassed.  Oh, no.  You know what I mean?  They let the kids just fucking milk their fucking tit tops in front of anybody, thinking  it's so natural.  Oh, it's natural.  Yeah, well, I want to fuck you now that I'm seeing that.  It's natural.  And I don't care whose baby it is. 
[03:13:30]  That's the best thing you ever did, though, right?  Having kids.  Yeah.  I really believe it's a very strong thing.  Yeah.  And I'm really tall.  My two sons are my best friends.  They're the nicest guys I know.  They really are nice kids.  Yeah, and Dylan actually just, he's got his first real girlfriend, took her to the prom  this weekend, the tuxedo, the whole thing.  Is she hot?  Yeah, she's really good looking and really nice.  Oh, man.  It's just so crazy when he goes, Dad, do you mind if she sleeps over this weekend? 
[03:14:00]  Oh, shit.  And I'm like, I can't believe what's going on in this house.  You allow it, though?  You know, because I got my wife in my room, you know, Max will meet some girl, you know,  Dylan's in his room, my mother-in-law's downstairs.  What kind of brothel are you running over there?  You know, the sister-in-law's in the other room.  Jesus.  You know what I mean?  And everybody's fucking?  No.  I don't know what goes on in the other rooms.  How's the sister-in-law look?  I don't listen like when I'm in a hotel room with my ear against the wall.  Sure.  How's the sister-in-law look? 
[03:14:30]  She's beautiful.  She got a guy?  She's married to a Navy SEAL.  Oh, I don't know.  I think he's away a lot.  Yeah.  No, he would stay in there, too.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Yeah, so when he's, like, doing whatever he's got to do, you know, they drop him off in different places.  So she'll come stay with us for a few months.  He's a tough guy?  Yeah.  No, he's the real deal.  Yeah, he's doing it a long time, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, he tells me certain stories that I go, I can't hear that.  Oh, man. 
[03:15:00]  You don't want to hear it?  Yeah, because it means nothing to him.  Yeah.  You know, and he's, like, when I look at that guy, I go, he's the reason you don't fuck with anybody in the street.  Because to look at him.  Yeah.  No, he's got the friendliest face.  You know, you can see he's in great shape, but, like, he's the type of guy, if you bumped into, some asshole would bump into him, go, you got a fucking problem?  Yeah.  And then he could take them apart in any 200 ways.  And then he's holding an eye.  But, you know, they don't just do that.  You know, he would never hurt anybody unless, you know, somebody physically attacked him. 
[03:15:30]  Sure.  But they go on the secret missions, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's stuff no one knows about.  It's like, I want to tell you stuff that I can't even tell you.  Right.  Right.  You know, that he would go, why did you talk about that?  Now you have to die.  Yeah.  He's got some of the, uh...  Well, talk in code.  Yeah.  Like numbers?  Give us one story, but talk in code.  Give us a code.  So he was supposed to do this, uh, three mission with these, uh...  Numbers?  Numbers. 
[03:16:00]  Like eight other guys.  Yeah.  A lot of numbers.  And then zero.  And then zero happened.  That sounds crazy.  No, I'm not saying zero happened.  Zero means someone had to be taken out, and now he's zero.  Something went down.  Something like that, right?  Yeah.  Something went down.  Yeah, like, look at this.  He could be over here now.  Look what's going on here.  Chicago.  That's Chicago.  They're going crazy over there.  Well, you know, that looks like my audience the other night.  Yeah, what the fuck is going on over there?  They're having a NATO summit, and some protesters showed up to hold up signs that, you know, 
[03:16:30]  say, stop war, and then they riot, and the Chicago police got to come out.  Yeah, well, let them go over there and stop it, then.  With their dumb checkerboard Purina hats.  You know, it's like these assholes that stand in front of a grocery with a clipboard.  Like, nobody ever gets, the clipboard doesn't fucking work.  You know?  You ever notice that?  Like, when you go in, there's always some asshole asking questions or something from  you.  Are you a registered voter?  I go, I don't even know what you're talking about.  I'm just walking in.  I'll tell you one thing.  Greenpeace hires the cutest girls to do that on the street.  Oh, really?  It's unbelievable. 
[03:17:00]  It's unbelievable.  I see that here.  It's smart because it makes you stop.  No, of course it makes you stop.  Are you a member of Greenpeace?  No, but what are you doing?  Yeah, exactly.  Wow.  No, that's what they do.  I think we're wrapping up.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  We're wrapping up already?  Wow.  Yeah, Mr. Dice.  You can come back, though.  We've got to take a hike.  I've got to leave town.  I want to go to Carnegie.  The planes go in the rain?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sometimes.  A little bit.  LaGuardia or JFK?  LaGuardia will never get out.  JFK will get out.  Okay.  Wow.  You're going to Carnegie, huh? 
[03:17:30]  No, do they?  Maybe.  Yes.  I haven't been there in a long time.  Why don't you get mad at me?  I'm not a plane driver.  I know you're not a plane driver.  You know, these guys got to be able to see, you know, or else they can't see.  Like, you know, I guess they got it down, like, where they got to go.  Yeah.  Because, like, with the clouds, you got to look for, like, an open pocket and go, there  it is.  I think they got that down this day and age.  I never figured that out.  I'm not a plane driver.  You know, because they got the mud flaps over there.  Yeah.  And what they do, they see, like, an opening, like, in the city, where they go, like, and 
[03:18:00]  then they, like, skim through the cloud, and then they get a little close, and then they  look for, like, one of them dare runway things.  That's not what they do, you dope.  All right, listen, let's get over there.  Dice, this is exciting news.  Friday, August 24th, you're shooting your last special for Showtime.  In Boston.  In Boston.  It's always been a great city.  Friday, August 24th.  Tickets go on sale Friday, May 25th, it looks like. 
[03:18:30]  It will sell out, obviously.  Yeah, it's going to be pretty insane.  The Wilbur.com.  The crowds have been fucking insane, I got to tell you that.  Good for you, man.  You know, it, like, feels like 88 to me again.  It's crazy with the dice chanting and, you know.  Oh, man.  Just insanity.  I wasn't seeing that until I really went on the road.  Yeah.  Like, I even did this tour, like, in the South, you know, where you don't think anything,  and it was just fucking mania.  Like, Jameson was saying to me, he goes, it's happening all over again. 
[03:19:00]  You know, because they, you know, him and Florentine, they really watch the shows because  they know there's not one ounce of homework in any of my bits, you know, and they go,  they're cheering for something that makes zero fucking sense.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Bunch of animals, huh?  No, but it's funny.  Yeah, of course it is.  That's always been my thing.  I don't care what I'm saying as long as it's fucking funny.  But your crowd, they're fucking animals.  They're complete animals.  Yeah, yeah.  And to me, the crowd makes up the show.  Yeah.  You know, you need that energy coming at you. 
[03:19:30]  Sure.  You know, you need, and I feel it going right through me when I'm on stage.  You know, so it's like, it's like a fight every night.  It's, you know, I come on stage, I'm just fucking burnt out.  You're having a good time.  You're all in shape.  You're smoking.  This club in, uh.  Smoked.  1988.  Drinking wine.  Joke is wild that I did.  They had 16 biker, like a biker gang, as my security.  Well, that worked out well.  And they're just throwing people out.  Didn't work it out to mine.  Yeah, yeah.  They're throwing out people for talking. 
[03:20:00]  And they're telling me at the show, the guy's going, I was just having fun.  And they go, it's not about that.  No.  The guy's on stage.  You don't talk.  You keep your mouth shut.  Yeah.  Just fucking laugh.  And the phone thing drives me fucking crazy when they start with the filming.  Oh, man.  You know, so this one guy's filming me when I start doing the poems.  He's got all these tattoos.  And I'm going, asshole, what did I say about the fucking filming?  You're a fucking ass.  And he's just holding the camera, right?  Why are you doing it?  And then I start doing, like, some of the, you know, awful jokes. 
[03:20:30]  Like, I fucked your mother in the ass and she had you type of thing.  Sure.  You know, and all of a sudden the camera moves and he's looking at me.  I go, no, keep filming.  You want to film?  Let me tell you what I think.  You're the part of the load that dripped down your mother's fucking leg.  You cocks.  And then he's, like, looking at me.  I go, no, keep filming.  You wanted a piece of tape.  And then here comes this giant fucking guy, like a mountain, and just picks him up and  they just throw him through the fucking door.  Yeah, he removed him with the chair. 
[03:21:00]  Just fucking, why not have the memory in your head?  You know, actually watch it.  This is what he was doing.  Look at, I don't care if you do it.  I know you.  We have a, I don't care if you just come film me right in your face.  I know you.  But when you're doing a show, it's like people don't know how to have a good fucking time.  I was taking a picture for Twitter.  Now, do whatever you want, him.  You and Mark Maron.  Are you on the Twitter?  You on the Twitter.  You and Mark Maron, let's do this.  For the Twitter.  There it is.  Nice.  No, it's blurry.  Blurry.  One more. 
[03:21:30]  Stop moving.  One, two.  And he goes, wait.  Yeah, that works.  I'm an idiot with headphones.  See, now I tweet that shit.  Oh, well.  Yeah, you've got to tweet.  People got to also go to the Real Dice Clay, because I'm having a contest.  What's the contest?  You know, so they've got to tweet me on the Real Dice Clay.  It's, um...  I can't do the contest here.  It's only when I do it live.  All right, then.  Just join, follow you on Twitter, and then we'll figure out the contest.  I do a lot of contests.  All right, the Real Dice Clay, Mark Maron, of course.  Big fan of Mark Maron's podcast, WTFPod.com. 
[03:22:00]  Thanks, man.  I have one plug.  Jimmy, yeah.  June 9th, I'm at the MGM Foxwoods with Artie Lang, Nick DiPaolo, David Tell, and myself.  Wow.  So is this the, um...  Antisocial, yeah.  The Antisocial.  We have a couple more shows.  Yeah, it's been really good.  And this is...  We have a couple more shows to announce, but right now, this is the one.  Ooh.  June 9th at Foxwoods.  That's been going for a while.  Yeah, we did.  I remember when you were at the Palms, Zanella, in Vegas.  We stopped.  We brought it there.  And then we stopped and we started again. 
[03:22:30]  Okay, cool.  Different lineup.  Clean show, right?  Yeah, we try to keep it to a minimum.  I don't like the F word.  All right.  Well, thank you again, Dice.  I can't believe we're going to go.  I woke up for this.  I know, right?  Oh, trust me.  We did it.  I woke up for this.  We did good.  I don't know.  At least you didn't have it coming too early.  No, no, no.  We did good.  We don't like when early, sleepy Dice comes in.  Yeah, you can only take me at small doses.  Cigarettes, we can only take at small doses.  Why don't you just say it?  Yeah, if you'll say it, you'll feel better.  That's not true.  There is no reason to have an honest conversation without honesty. 
[03:23:00]  That's not true.  No, Dice, we're dehydrated from all the smoking.  Yeah.  We need water now.  Oh, that's why you're ending the show?  Yeah, we need water now.  Yeah, we can't even see through the smoke at this point.  Ron and Fez come in here.  That's what I'm saying.  Another guy.  You can do another show.  I don't want to do that.  I don't even know these fucking guys.  All right.  I'm sure they're very nice people.  All right, you've heard about it.  You've waited four long hours for it.  And now the moment you've waited for rears its ugly nose. 
[03:23:30]  Head.  After Opie and Anthony Live is coming up next. </pre>
