<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with an unidentified song snippet and repeated commercial announcements, followed by characteristically vulgar banter between Opie and Anthony.  A caller, Jason the trucker, used homophobic slurs to criticize the opening song ("Ecstasy of Gold"), prompting a discussion about changing it to "America" for better replay identification.  Other potential opening songs were briefly considered.  The show then launched into "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday," a segment encouraging listeners with "wow" stickers on their cars to flash women, with instructions on obtaining the stickers.  The hosts discussed their technological reliance (cell phones, GPS), their job-related ignorance, and nostalgia for older technology, with Opie recounting his experience viewing inaccurate 1950s/60s technological predictions.

The conversation shifted to contrasting snow responses in New York City and Dallas, noting Dallas' gun culture.  Opie shared an anecdote about meeting openly armed listeners in Dallas. He then detailed his battle with a persistent mouse infestation, culminating in releasing the frozen mouse outside. This was interspersed with more crude jokes. The show concluded this segment with discussions about NYC rats and Opie's unsettling encounter with bunker fish while water-skiing, comparing the feeling of unseen underwater depths to snorkeling.  Throughout this portion, segments from the ACC Today sports show were interspersed.

The next segment began with a discussion about swimming in murky lakes (initially Lake Ontario, later corrected to Lake Erie), including Opie's story of showering in the lake during a Canadian boat trip.  Listener calls followed. Mike from PA discussed Opie’s mouse problem and his own loneliness. Frank, a former critic, surprisingly expressed newfound appreciation for the show and Jim Norton. The hosts recalled past online disputes with Frank. John from New Orleans discussed Sean Hannity's defense of the show and Lisa G's unsuccessful application.  They then predicted the imminent firing of Hot 97 DJs for playing a controversial "Tsunami" song parody.  Pat from Munaki (bearing gifts), a *Survivor* winner, and an unidentified guest joined them in studio.  Further calls followed, including one correcting the lake's name.

The hosts extensively analyzed the Hot 97 "Tsunami" song fallout, discussing media reactions, the weak apology, and the DJs' impending firing. They compared this to their own controversies, distinguishing between deliberate offense (like their "Most Offensive Song Contest") and unintentional offense. They discussed the predictable panic response of Hot 97 management, the news coverage (including song clips), potential FCC involvement, and the insincerity of public apologies.  A news clip detailing the outrage was played, followed by a call from Todd the Trucker, mentioning Bill O'Reilly's mention of Jim Norton. Another news segment discussed the apology and lack of FCC violation.  The hosts continued to analyze the predictable response, highlighting the lack of nuance and the automated nature of the firings. A listener call suggested ratings loss and that their past firings should have served as a warning. Another caller urged them to use more profanity, which they rejected, explaining their approach.  The uncensored "Tsunami" song and an Asian rapper's rebuttal were played, leading to a discussion of cultural appropriation and the rapper's sincerity.  The segment concluded with more discussion of the Hot 97 situation.

This segment continued focusing on the Hot 97 controversy and the outrage from Asian-American groups, the apology, and tsunami relief donations.  The appropriate punishment (community service, fines, firings) was debated, with updates on potential show suspensions or continued broadcasting to exploit increased ratings. An interview with Jenna, a *Survivor* contestant and Playboy model, followed, covering body hair, shaving, the Playboy shoot, post-*Survivor* life changes, and managing family expectations and financial requests.  Pat from Munaki, a recurring character from an eggnog contest, joined the studio, and his past comments and a photo of his amputated toe were discussed.  His humorous and often off-color remarks dominated the latter half of the segment, interspersed with a brief discussion of a Norm MacDonald stand-up routine.  The segment concluded with more discussion of Pat and the Hot 97 controversy.


The next segment featured Drew Boogie (music mixer), Pat from Monaki, and other callers. It began with discussion of a toe injury and health insurance. Drew Boogie presented new remixes, including a Tourette's-inspired one, eliciting expletive-laden responses.  The majority focused on Court TV audio clips about pornography found in Michael Jackson's home, sparking conversations about his guilt, the black community's reactions, and the nature of child pornography.  Numerous calls followed, discussing the Jackson case and listener-submitted jokes (some highly offensive). Listener letters mocking Johnny Carson's death were read and mocked.  Complaints from the Parents Television Council about sexually suggestive content in TV shows and commercials were also discussed with audio clips played.  Technical audio level issues were a recurring problem throughout.

The final segment detailed the hosts' frustration with persistent audio level problems on their satellite radio broadcast.  Inconsistent audio levels (sound bites much louder than their mics) were causing listener complaints.  They expressed anger and frustration with XM management, noting the four-month-long issue despite complaints and promised solutions.  They blamed management layers hindering communication with technical staff and threatened a deliberately mediocre show if the issues weren't fixed. They criticized XM's lack of marketing compared to Howard Stern's upcoming move.  Upcoming appearances and promotions were mentioned, along with XM product commercials (Delphi SkyFi 2, MiFi) and a promo for "The War of the Kumias." A caller shared similar marketing frustrations and disappointment with XM's handling.  Anthony from Jersey (claiming to be an XM stockholder) also criticized the marketing.  Pat from Munaki briefly contributed a joke about Gene Simmons.

[00:01:00]  I've got the lights, got the lights 
[00:01:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:02:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:02:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:03:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:03:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:04:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:04:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:05:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:05:30]  Back-breasted and awful.  And surrounded by dullards. 
[00:06:00]  Ben looks like poorly spliced film.  Oh, it's hilarious.  Ever Steve yawns?  It looks like the back of the Batmobile and it excites.  Paukatosis.  Eric, you're not going to cry.  Shut up.  Shut up.  And armed with superhuman powers.  He pulls his pants down and just starts leaking into someone's garbage shed.  That's rule one.  How about if he gives you the old chin tap with his helmet?  That's all right with me.  They are living among us.  They are living among us.  They are living among us.  They are living among us.  They are living among us.  Average citizens, average heroes, quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place. 
[00:06:30]  Controversial talkers, Opie and Anthony.  We are definitely mixed.  You better just sit back and watch.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We're cakes for nothing.  The last time I saw a mouth like that, I had a hook.  Okay, terrific.  Is that so? 
[00:07:00]  Who made you poke in this dump, huh?  How do you like to mow my lawn?  Huh?  I love the smell of napalm in the morning.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Oh dear.  Oh dear.  Makes me laugh every time, Anthony. 
[00:07:30]  You will be molested.  Oh, exactly.  Really fast.  Let's go to the phone and say hi to Jason, the trucker.  Jason, what's going on today, buddy?  Hey, how you doing?  You guys are great.  Hey, sticky bun.  He doesn't even have his headphones on yet.  He just stepped in.  Trying to get audio in there.  Oh, you gotta be kidding me.  I love noise.  Thanks.  Hey, buddy.  I'm coming up to complain.  It's open and strong.  It sucks.  I was hoping maybe you could change it to America.  Fuck yeah, every morning, man. 
[00:08:00]  That'd be kick-ass.  What opening song don't you like?  That fucking gay orchestra faggot shit.  Oh my God.  Gay orchestra faggot shit.  It's only a song from one of the greatest movies of all time and one of the greatest scenes  of all time.  In my opinion, it's Ecstasy of Gold from The Good, The Bad, The Ugly.  The graveyard scene.  The graveyard scene.  You know, Clint Eastwood there.  Well, it stinks, and I don't like it.  Still gonna call it faggot, my friend?  A Clint Eastwood spaghetti western? 
[00:08:30]  Are you trying to...  Faggot?  I'd say no.  Are you calling Clint Eastwood a faggot?  Yeah, you hang up.  I don't know.  I kind of like the Ecstasy of Gold to kind of break up the, you know, the replays.  It's great.  The show ends, and then right into that, and then you know you're getting prepared for  another show.  It gets people, lets them know what's coming.  The show is starting.  It lets people go do things, come back.  They know the show is on the way.  That's right.  Let's people, so you don't tune in right at whatever hour we're starting on the replay  and miss the beginning of the show. 
[00:09:00]  You can go, oh, all right, I know it's coming.  It gives you a chance to breathe, is what it does, you know?  Because a lot of people don't get to hear the show from 6 to 10 every morning, so they  might start listening at 8.30, and then they have to, you know, start, listen to the  replay.  Right.  So for them, they're like, okay, I'll breathe her, and now the show begins.  This is a part of the show I missed.  Show starts.  But I do like America, fuck yeah.  That could be cool to start every morning for a while.  Song is great.  It's not a bad idea.  Song's great, but you know. 
[00:09:30]  Ecstasy of Gold, America, fuck yeah.  Long sweeper from Martini Steve.  Now we're talking, we don't start talking at 6.15.  We're all about talking less.  Talking less is more gooder.  So if you guys want to suggest more things we could do to talk less, hey, I'm all for  it.  If we played America, they would freak out after four days.  You think?  You'd get people going, knock it off.  Enough.  Stop playing that song.  Enough.  Enough.  Well, we could play like Leonard Skinner and Freebird live. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, wow.  Now you're talking.  That'll get us to 6.30.  That's always a good lead in for the live version of Greengrass and High Tide.  Right.  So now you're talking, our goal has always been what, Ophie?  To talk less.  Actually, I remember us saying.  And to work less.  Our goal, the ultimate goal, would be to come in, not crack the mics once and leave having  done a whole show where we never talk.  It would be wonderful.  It would be a great, great thing.  So, well, good morning to everybody. 
[00:10:30]  It's Whipin' on Wednesday, even though in New York we could care less because, well,  it's snowing again.  A little bit of snow.  The weather people are all excited.  Another snow alert in our area.  How much will we get?  Tune in later in the program.  Minnesota just laughs at us.  Buffalo, New York laughs at us.  Syracuse, New York laughs at us.  Places that get these huge bases of snow, 90 inches.  Yeah, we're getting two inches today, gang, so you can laugh at us openly.  And the news is just losing their effing minds.  Ooh. 
[00:11:00]  They're just losing their minds.  I did run out of, um.  Because us New Yorkers, we can't drive in the snow.  They freak out.  Dude, I lived in Buffalo for three winters, man.  I mean, they don't close anything ever.  No.  I mean, we're talking blizzard after blizzard after blizzard.  Lake affects snow after lake affects snow after lake affects snow.  Because basically what happens, Anthony, before the lake freezes, it snows every day in Buffalo.  Yeah.  Because the wind kind of sweeps off the lake and drops some snow on the city every single 
[00:11:30]  day you have to brush off your car.  Every single day until the lake freezes.  And it's a complete nightmare.  And you know what?  They just get the plows out and people go to school.  They go to the malls.  They go to their jobs.  They can handle it.  Not here.  They close.  Look, I'm looking at school closing.  I know.  School closing.  There is nothing out there.  Nothing.  And they're closing schools.  Yeah.  But we can't take it.  We freak out.  Even better, though.  I mean, we're pretty wimpy here in New York. 
[00:12:00]  But I love seeing the footage of, let's say, Dallas.  Every once in a while, Dallas gets a little dusting.  Right.  And they just lose their minds.  Oh, they don't know what to do.  They start shooting each other with their guns that they just readily have available.  Right.  They don't know what to do.  You've never been to Dallas, right?  No.  When I was following Norton on tour a little bit and other comedians, when I was just plain  bored with my life, Anthony.  Yeah.  We went to Dallas a couple times.  And yeah, man, they could carry it.  It's the craziest thing.  You go to these. 
[00:12:30]  We went to the station's event that used to have us on there.  And there's people, just like our whacked out listeners here in New York, but they're  listeners with cowboy hats and pretty much carry.  Yeah.  You're able to carry guns.  Everywhere.  And you talk to these girls and stuff, and they all have a weapon that their daddy gave  them.  And they're all in their, like, most of them are in their glove compartments just waiting  to be used.  And how many people get carjacked down there.  It's just amazing.  I wonder.  How many carjackings are really going on when people know that there's a gun in the vehicle 
[00:13:00]  and the guy that they would be jacking is probably armed?  I bet they don't have that many carjackings down there.  No.  So, well, Anthony, it's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Yes, it is.  You want to explain Whip-Em-Out Wednesday?  Because quite frankly, I don't feel like explaining it every goddamn week.  Well, it's, as we have called it, the greatest radio promotion ever.  Can you sound a little more excited?  It is the greatest.  Have you looked at the clock, my friend?  Sound excited?  The listeners don't give a crap what time it is. 
[00:13:30]  They just want to be entertained.  Hey, everybody.  It's the most exciting radio promotion ever, ever in history.  You know, me and OB invented this back in the 60s when we first started radio on a big 50,000  Watt A.M. station in Oklahoma City.  It's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  All you got to do is you take a wow and put it on your vehicle.  Simple enough, right?  Right.  Well, what's that going to get you, people say?  Why should I put a wow on my vehicle?  I really don't know.  I can't wait for the answer. 
[00:14:00]  Well, a girl, a girl will be driving by and see the wow on your vehicle.  She'll go, oh, I know what that means.  I listen to Opie and Anthony.  I will pull next to this gentleman and pull down or up my blouse  and expose my breast to this gentleman.  One breast or a breast?  Could be both.  Could be the whole car full of chicks.  He's going to go, let's wow this guy.  And they see the wow.  It is a signal.  The boob signal has been sent out in your wow.  And girls pull up and flash you.  It's a little thing. 
[00:14:30]  You know how those contest radio stations that they give out the bumper stickers  and then they say, if our van spots you, we'll pull you over and give you tickets to a show?  What are the odds of winning that one?  Slim to none.  You know why?  Because there's one van looking for millions of bumper stickers that are out there.  Well, we've solved the problem.  And they usually only have one or two prizes.  Right.  With this Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, there's lots and lots of prizes.  Of course.  And lots of different prizes.  And quite frankly, some of the prizes are really nice.  And sometimes the prizes are really god-awful. 
[00:15:00]  No pun, but a booby prize sometimes.  You're kind of happy, though, because it was for free.  It's for free.  Right.  All it costs you is the energy to slap a wow on your vehicle.  Whether it's one of our stickers, whether you're scraping it in the dirt in the back of your truck, you make your own homemade sign, whatever.  You put it out there and you're not waiting for one van to pull you over.  There's millions of girls that are waiting to give you your prize.  And, you know, you have to have some patience with this.  It's like fishing, we call.  Yeah, we get a lot of emails from people. 
[00:15:30]  Hey, man, this wow thing's not working.  Trust me, it definitely works.  It works great.  But, you know, we're still building our audience as well.  So just get the wow in your car and have some patience, my friend.  Okay?  That's it.  All right.  Whip them out Wednesday.  How do they get their wow stickers, Anthony?  They could send a self-addressed stamped envelope to this address, Opie.  No.  What is the address?  I have no clue.  111.  Oh, good.  57.  I was figuring that one out.  111.57.  Right? 
[00:16:00]  Sweet.  What?  500.  500.  Sweet 500?  New York, New York.  New York, New York.  I don't know the zip code.  One.  I barely remember my own zip code.  0-1-9.  And I think that address is up on opandanthony.com, okay?  All right.  I don't know the address.  Huh?  I never know the address.  No.  Where we work.  You just know.  I just know how to get there.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, you could walk the envelope.  I know how to do that. 
[00:16:30]  Park at the garage.  Jamaican Michael.  Take your car.  And then you just kind of cut up seven.  You know, drop it off by hand.  It is pretty funny what we just don't know.  I know.  And things we just can't be bothered with.  Technology has screwed me completely now, as far as knowing people's phone numbers.  If I don't have my cell phone with me, I don't know Opie's number.  I've been calling you forever.  Yeah.  I have no clue what his number is, because I just go, phone book, Opie cell, beep, I hit 
[00:17:00]  the button.  But honestly, you're not alone with that.  I think pretty much everyone is in the same boat.  Yeah.  It used to be you had to memorize all these numbers.  You had to know the phone number.  And then the navigation system on the vehicle is the same thing.  I pop in an address where you used to have to get a map or go to MapQuest or Yahoo Maps,  and you would get a physical map, and you look at your little route, and you would see where  you had to go.  So if something happened in between point A and point B, you could pull your map out and  go like, all right, I know where I am. 
[00:17:30]  Well, now with the navigation system, if anything ever happened to the nav system, you would just  be where you are with no clue where you are, because it takes you from point A to point B.  I don't look.  I don't pay attention to signs anymore.  I hear, make the next right turn.  And I make it, because the machine told me to.  We're turning into zombies.  Zombies.  You know what's really cool?  I was watching some of those, you know, the films that I brought in the other day about  the sex education from the 50s?  I was watching something on the future. 
[00:18:00]  The future.  It was some World's Fair thing from like 1960.  Oh, man.  I would love the audio of that.  It was pretty cool.  What channel was that on?  It was online.  It was online?  I pulled out of an archive thing.  I'll send you the clip.  It's really cool.  They had a whole thing presented by Bell Telephone, and they were showing what the future holds  for telephones.  And it's just dial telephones.  You know, they didn't have push buttons.  Yeah, sure.  But they were showing the push button phones and how it would save time in dialing.  It was brand new technology, not even out yet. 
[00:18:30]  But then they also were showing call waiting, call forwarding, and a pager that was hysterical.  All you have to do is hold this.  Dude, it was a brick.  It was the size of a brick that you used to build a building with.  A brick.  And this guy puts it in his shirt pocket, and it weighs down his whole shirt.  And then they show somebody dialing the phone, and it just goes, beep, beep.  Dude, I know the competition is way behind.  You don't have to bring it up, though.  Oh, true. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  That's exactly what it is.  Oh, you're talking about cell phones?  Cell phones.  Oh, I thought you were talking about the portable unit.  Like the new portable unit?  The little doggy company that, you know, you got to dial the phone.  And you hear beeps, and...  Oh, okay.  But it was pretty cool what they had been working on.  Call waiting.  With like a dial phone and call conferencing.  This was 1960.  And they come back to, you know, they showed it all.  And then they come back to the woman that was doing the tour.  And all the people that are at the World's Fair in front of her.  And it's like, things like this will be available in the future. 
[00:19:30]  And I watched another one that was from 1940, talking about the future, 1960.  So they were projecting 20 years in the future and what would happen.  And they're talking about interstate highways with on-ramps and off-ramps that would allow you to reach speeds of 50 miles per hour.  Yeah.  Really?  Really.  It's insane.  Pretty cool stuff, though.  So you got to get off of the sex ed tapes every once in a while and go check out other stuff. 
[00:20:00]  Did they talk about the flying cars, Anthony?  Never any inkling of flying cars.  I think they were trying to be realistic because it was only 20 years in the future.  But I'm sure if in 1940 they did a show or a film about the year 2000, 2005, 2010, I am certain it would involve flying cars and mylar suits.  Because they, you know, the way they were looking at 1960 was like, oof, we're taking rocket ships.  You know, this is the future.  And then you look forward, you know, we have plenty of really cool things here in 2005. 
[00:20:30]  I mean, computers alone really changed the landscape of the way we live.  But we still drive internal combustion cars.  Sure, they look cooler.  The gadgets are really cool inside them.  But the bottom line, it's four rubber tires on asphalt with spark plugs, gasoline, and pistons banging up and down.  You know, nothing changed as far as that goes.  Even aircraft changed, you know.  We went from internal combustion propeller planes to jet engines, you know. 
[00:21:00]  And then it pretty much stopped there.  It's basically the wings, the tail, things like that.  But, you know, the way they were looking toward the future by the year 2000, even us as kids, you'd think of the year 2000, it wasn't about driving cars anymore.  What happened?  Yeah, you look at your family photographs and you look at the cars you had growing up.  And then you look at the ones you have today.  It's like, oh, yeah.  Not much has really changed there.  They don't rust anymore like they used to. 
[00:21:30]  And, you know, things like that.  The gadgets are cool.  You could get in and press your heated seat and things like that that they never dreamt of.  Safety, a lot better as far as safety goes.  But, you know, you're still every so often on the side of the road with your hood up and steam billowing out of the thing.  Who saw that in the year 2005?  All right, let's say hi to AJ in Cleveland.  AJ, what's up, buddy?  Hey, what's up, man?  I just called it to defend that opening song.  It's one of my favorite songs.  But I was wondering if I could get that in the soundtrack. 
[00:22:00]  I like when you guys remixed it, too, for the Best of Shows.  That's an alternate version you got for that, right?  Yeah, that was pretty cool, too.  I love the song.  It's available on the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.  I'm sure you'll find a soundtrack of that.  I have a cassette soundtrack.  It's not easy to find, but you can't get it.  Oh, that's my favorite song.  I think it's an awesome song, man.  All right, great.  Thanks, AJ.  All right, take it easy.  Jim from Brooklyn has an idea for an opening song.  Yes, Jim.  Hey, Jim.  Your phone's crapping out again, but you guys add on, whatchamacallit, 
[00:22:30]  Alice's Restaurant, you're at 745.  Oh, if we add in Alice's Restaurant, it would be an hour.  That's not a bad idea.  We can barely hear you guys.  We can barely hear you.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I think it's you, though.  I'm fucking out.  I think it's you.  Hey, Bubba from Oklahoma.  What's up, Bubba?  What's going on, man?  How are you, bro?  I got a question, man.  The show's going downhill, downhill fast, compared to what it was when you guys first came on.  Oh, that's good.  That means we're picking up speed. 
[00:23:00]  Downhill fast, right?  Well, I mean, you know, what happened to, you know, Lesbian Fridays and Sexiest State?  You know, What's in Your Pants?  We play What's in Your Pants.  And even Morton's paying down.  Well, you like all the really good comedy bits.  No, the reason we haven't done a lot of that stuff, it's hard to get chicks in here to do stuff, dude.  You'd be surprised how many times they show up and they don't do anything,  where they say they're going to come and they don't come.  And it's like, we don't say, hey, there was supposed to be chicks today,  but we just look out and there's no one here but us.  Right.  You know, Bubba, this show, I don't know, it kind of goes in stages, that's all. 
[00:23:30]  It's, you know, we'll get the sex back into the show.  It's just the natural progression of what we do.  I'm looking like an ass, because I got, you know, the guys that work,  we all cattle for a living, we're all truck drivers.  Right.  You know, and those guys are ready to, you know, dump it, because it ain't what it was  when I, you know, what I was telling them, and, you know, they're making me look like an ass.  If you're looking for a radio show that just does naked chicks and girls moaning,  then you know what, this isn't the place for you.  I mean, will we throw that in there and spice it up?  Of course, but. 
[00:24:00]  It's not what the show's all about.  It's not really what the show's about, bro.  Never has been.  What are they going to do?  Dump their $2 a month and listen to what?  The 50 station, which is fine?  I don't know.  No, but they'll let them dump it.  That's fine.  They want tits and ass.  Go to the playboy show.  Have patience, my friend.  Have patience.  $24 a year, and they'll dump it and get absolutely no sex on the radio.  Honestly, I have no idea where, you know, we do have girls come in.  We have no problem doing sexiest state.  We haven't had a couple, you know, step up lately.  You know, maybe they heard what the other couple did, and they don't think they can compete. 
[00:24:30]  I don't know.  We could easily play.  We played Guess What's in My Pants last week.  We haven't done a good morning queef in a while.  Maybe we'll get one of those on today.  You never know.  All right?  Your phone's just fading in and out again.  All right, Bubba.  Thank you.  Yeah, we got to work on that phone thing.  Bubba from Oklahoma.  What's up?  He doesn't think this show is good.  So I'm talking to my sister last night.  She gets to hear the show in Orlando.  Is this a sex break? 
[00:25:00]  I just want to show how pathetic I am.  She goes, hey, get my Christmas card.  Sorry, I sent it out late.  I'm like, no.  Uh-oh.  But I sent it like two weeks ago.  I'm like, well, I lost my mailbox key.  And this is a true story, by the way.  You did lose your mailbox.  Yeah.  At least two to three weeks ago. 
[00:25:30]  You're a losey guy.  And I'm like-  You lose everything.  So I haven't been able to open up my mailbox in the last two to three weeks.  Oh, man.  That pisses the mailman off.  And I'm like, and the weird thing is I just don't care.  I know.  Well, I shouldn't have said that.  I don't care.  Aren't there bills and stuff in there?  Yeah.  Well, what are we, at the end of the month, I guess?  Yeah.  That's the only reason why I haven't really worried about it yet.  Because I guess right about now, all the bills are coming.  Yeah.  You should really start worrying.  So now I need to find a way to get into my mailbox. 
[00:26:00]  Right.  But I guess it happened right around New Year's.  So I'm thinking, eh, it's the first of the month.  What could possibly come in that's really important?  All your bills are for the end of the month?  Pretty much, I guess.  I got bills every day.  They just come in.  Dude, I don't even really care.  If they're late, they're late.  Really?  Yeah, I really don't care.  Get the red notice, going, hey, ass.  I'm usually pretty good.  But I had to tell my sister, your Christmas card is in my mailbox that I can't open right now. 
[00:26:30]  I'm sure it's all wrinkled and crushed.  I know.  That's the way the mailman shoves stuff.  They get pissed.  I know.  They use the palm of their hand and just keep shoving stuff in there.  Yeah.  I used to do that at the apartment I lived in, especially when we would go on vacation.  And the mail would just be crushed in there.  And then there was a little note once from the mailman, we'll not deliver any more mail  until this is cleaned out.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And they kept it at the post office.  I might be at that stage then.  Maybe.  At least three weeks of mail.  So I don't know.  I was like, yeah.  I got to find the key, I guess. 
[00:27:00]  And it's one of those tiny little keys.  I don't even know how to get another one.  They don't make copies of them.  You got to go to the post office.  My landlord's a scumbag.  Approve who you are.  Pay for it.  My landlord's a scumbag.  He listens to the show.  He thinks, I think, he's a great guy.  No, you're really a scumbag.  The guy actually changed his phone number so no one could get a hold of him.  Ah, that's a good move.  I'm dead serious.  Good move for a landlord.  And there's little problems here and there.  My brother's like, you know, with this mouse problem you have, you should call the landlord.  You're paying some top dollars to live where you live. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  I'm like, he's a scumbag.  He ain't going to do anything.  He's going to tell me to go get mousetraps.  He doesn't care.  You know, he's pretty much leasing the building.  It's some weird thing they do in New York.  He's like leasing the building from the owner so he takes care of everything.  Subletting.  Whatever it's called.  But the guy literally, not literally, last winter, he changed his phone number so no  one could get a hold of him.  What a tool.  Thanks.  I'm not paying rent until, you know, he calls me and then I'll go.  That'll work.  And then I'll go, dude, you know, if you want your check, give me a, you know, well, 
[00:28:00]  he can't mail it to me.  Give me another key for the mailbox.  But isn't that your fault?  You lost the key?  Yeah, but who's supposed to give me a new key?  Am I supposed to pull it out of my butt?  I don't think the landlord does it.  I think it's the post office.  You really think the post office has an extra key to my mailbox?  No, but I think they would know what to do.  Really?  Because, yeah, the mailman's got to open it up every day.  Although they've got that big one master key.  Yeah, he's got the master key that brings the whole thing down. 
[00:28:30]  Master key.  And I've been waiting for him so I can run out there and go, hey, can I get my mail?  But I'm missing him or something.  Because now, yeah, now I know the bills are coming.  I've got to get into that damn thing.  Oh, that's why I love the suburbs.  You hear the nice suburban music play as the mailman smiles walking down your sidewalk.  Hello, Anthony!  Reaches into his bag, hands me the mail right at my front door.  I don't even have a mailbox.  And you're standing on the front stoop with a pipe. 
[00:29:00]  Right.  With a pipe and a paper under your arm just waiting for the mail.  Hey, hello, Bob.  How you doing?  And your bathrobe and slippers.  Yeah.  You know, I really don't have a mailbox.  He comes right to the door and leaves it, like, in the vestibule area in the front.  It's the greatest thing.  I don't even have to feel the cold when I check my mail.  It's wonderful.  All right, let's go to Doug in Ohio.  Doug, what's going on?  Hey!  Ah, turn that down!  Doug! 
[00:29:30]  What an ass.  Hey, Doug!  I forgot about this.  What are you doing?  Let's go, Doug.  You're listening to the radio, you jackass.  What's that?  Oh, my God.  Bye, Doug.  What an idiot.  And he had a great line.  You know, we want this to be a very interactive radio show, but lately, you know, you guys  talk about the show going downhill, which I totally disagree with, by the way.  But you guys, man, you've got to be on top of it.  If we go to the phones, you've got to get right into it.  Help us out.  It's a very interactive show, but now we don't even want to go to the phones. 
[00:30:00]  Is it our fault?  Have we not trained the callers properly?  When you call up, turn your damn radio down and listen.  Listen in the phone.  When we say hello, it's you we're talking to.  Yeah, there's a slight delay because of all the computers and the equipment they use to  do satellite radio.  Yeah.  So, I mean, a lot of people get caught up listening to the delay instead of what's going  on in their ear.  Jim, Indiana, what's up? 
[00:30:30]  Hey, buddy.  I think I got I think I know what you need to do for your mailbox key.  All right.  You need to make a post it.  Put a post a note up there on your box.  Tell the post, man, the landlord's an asshole.  I need a mailbox key now and they will handle it.  All right.  Well, look at that.  The post office will handle it.  If you can't get a mailbox key, they will take care of that.  I'm going to do the post it thing today because I need my bills now. 
[00:31:00]  I need my mail.  All right.  And I need to make a challenge for the ladies in Illinois today.  All right.  What's that, Jim?  It's with them out Wednesday.  I need a woman in Illinois going west to flash me.  It's kind of cold up there, though, no?  Sure.  All right.  No.  It's cold where you're at.  It's not that bad up there today?  No.  35 degrees.  This ain't cold.  All right.  Yeah.  You know, women could flash that with 35 degrees out.  All right. 
[00:31:30]  Thank you, Jim.  Hey, I can hear you fine, by the way.  Yeah, I know.  I think it depends on what kind of phone people are using.  Yeah.  If they're, I don't know, if they got a loud car.  I don't know.  If they're on a busy highway.  Something's going on.  All right.  I got my sticker on the back of this trailer.  So, hi, ladies.  Here I go.  All right, ladies.  There he goes.  Good night, ladies.  All right.  We're just warming up.  Why don't we take a quick break here, Anthony?  Right.  Right.  This is a Ben pick.  He said, hey, guys, you haven't played Hayseed Dixie lately.  A hillbilly tribute to ACDC. 
[00:32:00]  Maybe Bubba from Oklahoma like this one.  Which one do you want to?  You want to hear Highway to Hell, You Shook Me All Night Long, Dirty Deeds.  What do you think?  Any one of those in hillbilly fashion is just as good as the other.  Highway to Hell, You Shook Me, or Dirty Deeds.  I would vote Dirty Deeds.  Really?  Yeah.  It's all Bon Scott classic.  All right.  Dirty Deeds, Dun Dirt Sheep, Hayseed Dixie, a hillbilly tribute to ACDC.  And we'll continue.

[00:37:30]  XM 202  The O.B. and Anthony Show  Not the body's in the throat, not the body's in the throat, not the body's in the throat.  Not the body's in the throat, not the body's in the throat, not the body's in the throat.  Ow!  The P-A-N?  Shut up.  First thing I do is look at those buttons and see if they're red or green in front of you. 
[00:38:00]  Well, I just say things to shock people and get them all energized for the radio program.  You're a shock jock even when the shows are not on.  I sure am, Anthony.  I sure am.  You're as shocking as a Con Edison plate.  One of those metal plates that they...  Haven't you been reading the news?  Con Edison plate. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, exactly!  The only con is that they're safe.  A doggy got shocked.  Yesterday, a woman was walking her dog, and the dog stepped on one of these Con Edison  plates, these metal plates that cover up the holes in the street and sidewalk and stuff.  You've walked on them before.  Sometimes they're electrified.  It's electric.  And a dog stepped on it and got shocked.  Good.  Did it die?  Actually, no. 
[00:39:00]  Damn it!  I saw his finger on there.  But the dog started jumping around, the woman was saying.  Yeah.  The dog was jumping around like crazy on the plate.  And so the dog doesn't normally do that because it's on Prozac.  The dog...  Is on Prozac.  Is on Prozac.  Enough with your stupid dogs.  These people treat these animals like...  You know, dogs are so easy.  You own them.  You pet them when they're good.  When they're bad, you grab their head, you stick it in the pile of crap, and you smack 
[00:39:30]  them with the newspaper.  That's it.  I want to start a company.  Doggy Daycare.  Opie's Doggy Daycare.  Oh.  The logo is a big boot going into a liver.  Enough of your stupid dogs.  People treat their dogs better than their own family.  With the booties and the sweaters and the baby talk.  Oh.  Enough.  The front of my building smells like urine because of these stupid dogs.  Really?  Dropping logs in front of the building and people are picking it up. 
[00:40:00]  It's just sickening.  Dude, I got to tell you, you're the friend there.  Bob Kelly has a couple of faggy little dogs there.  I like Bob's dogs.  They're a little faggy.  They are very faggy, but they're actually very fine animals.  That's the funniest thing about living in New York City.  People want dogs.  They need companionship.  Yeah.  But they live in really small apartments.  And so you see these big, huge guys walking these tiny little rat dogs down the road because  that's the only dog they could have in their apartments.  You can't have a big dog.  And don't say it's a gay thing because it's not. 
[00:40:30]  You can tell these guys would really like a much bigger dog.  They just can't keep one of these bigger dogs in their apartment.  So instead of having no dogs at all, they get the little tiny little rats.  And they're walking down the sidewalk with their little rat dog.  And Bob Kelly has a couple of those, right?  Little small ones, yeah.  Silky Terrier and something else.  But the one dog does love me very much.  So I like the dogs.  Aw.  I go over there just to pet it.  Do you really?  Yeah.  I have to tolerate that stupid fat Samoan.  But I go over there just to pet the animals. 
[00:41:00]  I've always enjoyed in my youth having a dog.  But I don't like other people's dogs.  I don't like going over people's houses that have dogs because it's that goddamn head in  the crotch thing where they're jumping up and down like crazy and they've got to jump  on you.  And the owner of the dog is like, oh, don't worry.  He's fine.  No, it's not fine.  He's jumping all over me.  Get the slobbering mess off.  Then your hands smell like dog.  And this little lipstick thing pops out every once in a while.  Oh, well, there's some good with the bad. 
[00:41:30]  And he humps your face for a half hour.  And you keep going, get off me.  Get off me.  Red racket.  Red racket.  Red racket.  You just help out a little bit.  Those videos online are just the worst.  Download those animal things.  Speaking of pets, I mentioned it yesterday.  I guess this would be a good time to talk about the mouse in my apartment. 
[00:42:00]  Ah.  I caught the mouse, Anthony.  I caught the mouse.  Did you kill him?  Well, here's the deal.  As you know, I've had a mouse living in my apartment.  I only noticed this a couple months ago, but I couldn't find the sucker.  A mouse in an apartment with no food in it.  What is that about?  Well, I decided to starve the mouse out because I couldn't get him.  So I started really keeping the kitchen nice and clean and not leaving things out.  I discovered the mouse because my brother and his family stayed in Manhattan with me for a few days. 
[00:42:30]  And they left all their food out on the counter in the kitchen, like granola-type things and trail mix.  Mouse food.  Pretty much mouse food.  And one day after the show, I walk into my kitchen.  There's a mouse just having a field day with all the food.  So since then, I've been trying to keep the kitchen nice and clean so the mouse doesn't eat.  Well, over the weekend, I discovered my bread was the only thing that was out.  It had a hole in the back completely through both bags because, you know, they double-wrapped the bags pretty much. 
[00:43:00]  And then a piece of bread just completely demolished.  I'm like, oh, my God, this mouse is getting really desperate, okay?  And it's been showing itself a lot lately because it really needs food.  So I'm at my apartment on Monday with my brother, and I'm sitting down eating a little lunch and just talking to my brother.  And I turn to my left, and I look down, and the mouse is just looking up at me, staring at me,  and then kind of climbing up some pillows that I had on the floor, kind of climbing up toward me because it's desperate for food at this point. 
[00:43:30]  So he's coming to you looking like, please feed me?  Honestly, that's what I think was going on.  So then I kind of, like, went to kind of, you know, grab him.  Well, yeah, brave me, whatever.  I try to trap him, and he ran back into the kitchen.  What do you use?  Under the refrigerator.  No, it gets better.  So then my brother leaves, and I'm on the computer, you know,  and my computer's next to one of my TVs, and I'm always checking out the news while I'm online.  And I look up at the TV, and there's the mouse, like, on the shelf with the TV, just kind of looking at me. 
[00:44:00]  I'm like, what?  This is a psychotic mouse, man.  Scoping you out.  So I'm like, you know, it's time to get rid of the mouse.  So I spent, like, a half hour to 40 minutes, like, kind of trapping it.  Yeah.  You know, I was able to keep it on that shelf and keep it in the back of the shelf because it was scared and stuff.  How do you trap them, though?  Like, what are you using?  Nothing at this point.  I just knew if I just made a movement toward him, he was going to go to the back of the shelf.  So he's kind of in the shelf area where all the, you know, the cable boxes and everything. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, okay.  So I'm kind of keeping him there, trying to figure out how I'm going to trap him, get a towel or a garbage pail.  I don't know.  And then the mouse comes out, and it's kind of a cute mouse.  Gray and stuff.  Nice R, sure.  Didn't look too disease-ridden or dirty.  So I'm starting to think, I'm a pretty lonely guy these days.  I'm thinking.  A mouse and a java log?  You know, I'm thinking that I could maybe keep this mouse as a pet.  Uh-huh.  Put a string on the tail, maybe? 
[00:45:00]  I mean, I'm thinking, you know, maybe at this point the mouse is so hungry I could get a piece of cheese or a piece of bread or some nuts or something.  In retrospect, lighting the match was a bad idea.  And I'm thinking, you know what?  Maybe I should just, you know, keep this mouse and train it and just let it run around my apartment as my pet.  Yeah, unless you can toilet train it.  Yeah, exactly.  So this is going through my head.  And then I'm like, you know, you lonely freak.  What are you, stupid?  So all of a sudden the mouse just, you know, darts for freedom and jumps off the shelf, which is about four feet high, and just leaps about three feet. 
[00:45:30]  Takes off, and then it's running around the basement area of my apartment and then runs under a doorway into a closet.  So then I finally, you know, make the long story short, I mean, it took a while, but I finally got a towel on it and had it in the towel.  And I'm like, I can't kill the damn thing.  I'm a wimp when it comes to, like, animals and crap.  So, well, unless you're a dog that's eating my prime rib dinner.  What?  How did you get the mouse out of the closet?  Did you comment on its open shirt and little small hat? 
[00:46:00]  Very good.  So then I got the mouse in the towel, and I'm thinking, you know, I can't kill it, but it has to leave my apartment.  Right.  So I dump it outside, and it was literally, what, Monday, 11, 12 degrees, whatever it was.  Very cold.  And I drop it on the ground, you know, probably sentencing it to death.  But I'm thinking, look, hey, dude, if you can figure this out, good luck to you.  But he might actually come back. 
[00:46:30]  That's what my brother was saying.  And he goes, these mice, they know how to get back.  They kind of do sometimes.  They know where they are.  They have a good sense of smell.  Find that apartment again and just run back in.  And my brother, who's passed out on the couch because I had to pick him up because he had a colonoscopy.  And nothing's going on with him.  He just had a checkup, you know?  Yeah.  And I didn't even know this.  When you get one of these colonoscopies these days, or colonoscopy, right?  Oh. 
[00:47:00]  Compete.  They knock you out, and you need a family member or somebody to pick you up from the hospital.  It's like a law, I guess.  So I went and got him and brought him back to my place, and he's out cold.  But he wakes up just enough to go, do you think that's the only mouse in your apartment?  If you think so, you're nuts.  And then just falls back to sleep.  That's true, too.  A lot of times, more than one mouse.  Well, it's been a couple days, I haven't seen any signs of any other mouses.  No droppings?  A little bit on the counter before I got this one out of there. 
[00:47:30]  Mouse crap.  That's what you can see.  How about the mouse pee?  That's just everywhere.  Eek.  Oof.  So.  Kill them all.  So that's the end of that little soap opera.  Just had him in the towel and wrapped it against the sink.  Throw the towel and mouse away.  You kind of miss the little fella, though, Anthony.  Do you?  Yeah.  He's been showing himself a lot in the last week or two, and I kind of miss him.  A little pet.  At first, I was scared S-less.  I mean, I'm.  Those little beady eyes.  Well, you see any little, like, critter in your apartment or your house, it freaks you 
[00:48:00]  out a little bit.  I don't care if the mouse is tiny, you know.  It freaks you out.  It just surprises you when they jump out.  Yeah.  When you just walk into your kitchen to get a glass of water or what have you, and you  see it on the counter sitting there, you get freaked out at first.  I had one run right over my foot once, and yeah, it just, I let out a bitch scream.  Just a bitch scream.  Awful.  Felt completely emasculated.  They scare you.  They kind of jump out.  You don't know what it is. 
[00:48:30]  My brother was telling some stories, I mean, before he started doing well with his career,  he lived on the east side, way uptown, in a really crappy apartment.  There were so many rats in his apartment that.  Rats.  That they made it a sport, like they were just killing rats with, like, frying pans  and stuff.  No joke.  I mean, they would just go, just go off.  Yeah.  You know.  Ugh.  And blood everywhere, because, I mean, they, just animals.  I mean, they were a bunch of rugby players.  Yeah.  And they almost got excited.  It was almost like a sport, all of a sudden, the call would come out, rat, and they would 
[00:49:00]  all get into position, get their weapons, and just go hunting in their own apartment.  There are a lot of rodents in this city, man.  Oh, dude, you can't take the subway without seeing one almost every day.  There are a bunch of these little parks, not like parks where people really sit and do  things, but these little fenced-off park areas between streets and stuff to kind of look  nice, and one of them, I guess it was up by 72nd Street, people used to throw birds  seed around to feed the pigeons around this little park area, and the pigeons never 
[00:49:30]  came there to eat it, because the rats, these now very well-fed rats, were just running  rampant.  72nd and what?  That might be the place me and Voss used to go.  Right?  By Broadway?  Yeah.  Oh, that's where we and Richie used to stop.  Isn't that near the subway there?  Yep.  Now it's new, but they gutted that park.  But he's talking about, it's like a little, it's like a little, it's between two blocks  that separate.  We would stop and put Reese's Peanut Butter Cups out and then sit in his car and just watch  the rats come out and eat it.  You know what, it was a lot of vegetation in there, so you couldn't really see the rats 
[00:50:00]  in the park, but you would see the vegetation moving.  Oh my God, really?  Just droves, and then occasionally rats would come flying out of it, grab whatever they  could on the sidewalk, and run back into the vegetation.  Wow.  Frightening.  Imagine tossing someone into there.  The rats would probably just scatter, because Washington Square Park, which I walk by a lot,  which is a pretty large, you know, it's a couple blocks park in the village.  I see them every night when I walk by, and again, you'll see the foliage moving.  Ugh, it's creepy. 
[00:50:30]  And they'll run out right in front of you sometimes, at like 3, 4 in the morning, when it's nice.  Huge, big, muscular.  Big rats.  Like, you see their rear legs, they're muscular rats.  That is frightening.  They don't bother you.  A strong rat.  They just nibble at children laying in their beds.  Good, that's fine.  One less little rotten thing to cry on a plane if his lips are chewed off.  You know, you brought back a memory.  I don't know if I've ever told this story on the air, but you talk about, like, throwing  someone into the brush with the rats and stuff, right?  Well, growing up on Long Island, I was really into water skiing, and, you know, all the 
[00:51:00]  little harbors.  I mean, you did your jet skiing in probably all the same harbors, you know?  Huntington, Centerport.  And in the summer there, you know, the blues come into these harbors, right?  And the blues come into the harbors because they're following the bunker.  You know what bunker are?  Yeah, they're like minnows or something.  No, no, they're big.  The bunker, I think they could get up to almost a foot, maybe a little less than a foot.  They're a big bait fish that the blues love, and they pretty much don't have teeth, or 
[00:51:30]  if they do, they're really, really small.  They can't really do much damage, okay?  But when you're water skiing in these harbors, especially, like, late afternoon in the summer  when it's really hot and the tide's coming up, you could see schools of bunker.  And there's so many that there's barely water.  I mean, there's just a cluster of bunker, and you know the blues are there because they're  jumping out of the water.  You know, that's the only, I guess that's the only way, you know, that...  They're feeding.  Yeah, they're just flipping out.  Well, when we used to water ski, we used to have a lot of fun.  And we would try to drop the skier in the middle of the school of bunker. 
[00:52:00]  And I was on...  Creepy.  I was skiing once, and Billy Bertram, God, an old friend, was driving the boat, dropped  me right in the middle of a school of bunker.  You want to be freaking freaked out beyond belief.  They were just, you know, bouncing into my body, hitting me as I'm sitting there waiting  for the boat to turn around to get me.  That's real creepy.  Dude, screaming, like, get me the F out of here, just losing my mind, losing my effing 
[00:52:30]  mind.  Did you, like, all of a sudden your friend was next to you, and he flipped over, and  there was no bottom half?  The bunker had eaten him from the waist down.  I'll never go water skiing again.  Just creepy, though, as they're banging into you.  Hope he's in the water.  Bunker in the water.  Our bunker.  And the creepy part about it, you know, the fishermen and all that told, you know, told  us that if they're carrying on like that, it means there's blues underneath them.  Yeah.  And the blues will do damage. 
[00:53:00]  And they can nip at you.  Oh, they'll do damage.  Blues are sharks?  Oh, my God.  What?  Were they sharks blues, or they're just big fish?  No, no, no.  Blues.  And you hear Opie with his horrible high-pitched screaming and hollering.  Then, bunker comes up, little beady eyes roll back white, lifeless eyes like a doll's  eyes, come in and kind of annoy you.  Yeah, well.  Oh, man.  That is creepy, though. 
[00:53:30]  There's monsters under that water, man.  I always loved jet skiing.  Really did.  Years ago, it was out there every day.  But when you get thrown off of that thing, and you got to swim back to it, all I could  think of was, oh, my God, there's monsters in this water.  Monsters that I can't see that in a second is going to bite my leg.  Dude, there wasn't a porch there for you to run under and hide.  Monsters.  Oh, dude.  Jaws ruined that for just everybody.  Yeah.  Absolutely everybody.  I believe before Jaws came out, people would just jump in the harbors and the water and 
[00:54:00]  think nothing of it.  Yeah.  Absolutely nothing of it.  But you're so right.  When you're in the middle of a harbor and you fall off a jet ski or water skiing and  you're just sitting there by yourself waiting for the boat to come around, it is just, you  know what, I think everyone will agree just about it.  It's just a creepy feeling.  What's worse?  What can I see right now?  Right.  Because they could see me.  What's worse?  Not being able to see or being like down in the Bahamas where you can see what's down  there.  Right.  Because I don't know. 
[00:54:30]  Both of them are creepy as hell.  You look down in the Bahamas and you're swimming around and it's like, I could see  everything.  I'm seeing fish.  But Anthony.  If something big comes up here, I'm just going to crap myself.  I'll answer.  I would rather see because I've done the snorkeling and scuba diving and all that.  Right.  I've seen some crazy things scuba diving.  You want to know if a Frenchman's coming at you with his fists.  I've seen crazy stuff scuba diving, but you feel better because you can see it.  Yeah.  We saw a whole school of barracuda and all sorts of things that if someone told you that 
[00:55:00]  that was down there but you couldn't see it, it would be kind of creepy.  Let me tell you something though.  Scuba diving is different.  When you're down there with them, not that you have an advantage or you're on equal footing  with the beasts, but you kind of feel better that you have the mask, you can see much better,  you're breathing underwater, and you're with them, you're amongst them.  When you're swimming and your head and shoulders is popped out above the water and you don't  know what's going on underneath, or even if you can see, you are completely at their mercy. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  I was just answering your question.  I mean, it's creepier because you can't see what's down there.  Yeah.  And there could be nothing.  I've gone on boat trips from Rochester, New York, to Canada with Brother Weez, one of my  heroes and really good friend who does radio up in Rochester.  And in the middle of the lake, he'll just stop the boat, freshwater lake, and we'll jump  in.  Lakes are even creepier, by the way.  Yeah.  We would do these weekend boat trips and there's no way to really shower, so what we would do 
[00:56:00]  is we would just stop in the middle of the lake.  And supposedly Lake Erie just drops down like, I don't know, like half a mile.  I mean, it's ridiculously deep.  A bunch of people on the boat, by the way.  I don't want to turn this into another Javalogue story.  And then he would have all sorts of shampoo and body wash soaps and stuff, you know,  because we're going to Canada and maybe, you know, do dinner or whatever.  And we would just kind of quickly rinse off in the lake. 
[00:56:30]  Doesn't that defeat the purpose of soap?  Huh?  If you're rinsing off in the lake, Lake Erie?  Well, we would go in there and shampoo.  The water is really fresh.  Is it?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, I wouldn't drink it, obviously, but it's fresh enough to get a quick shower in  because it's fresh water.  It's not like the Long Island Sound.  It's salt water, which is a nightmare.  Nasty.  But so we would jump in, and you jump off the boat, and you're even scared to, like, jump  in and dive, you know, knowing that it drops down like a half a mile.  It's just so creepy, and it's so dark and black. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  You know?  And it's supposed to be a fun thing.  Hey, we'll go for a swim in the middle of the lake.  And you're just creeped out.  You want to stay within two feet of the boat.  Yeah.  You know?  You venture out 10, 15 feet, which is nothing if you think about the lake and everything,  but you feel like you're a mile away from the boat at that point.  You can't think about that stuff when you're out there.  The second you start thinking about it, you freak yourself out, and then you do that panic  swim to whatever safety there is, a boat or the shore or something.  I've done that, where you're just out there, and it's like, oh, this is nice, you know? 
[00:57:30]  The gentle bobbing, and, you know, the waves are nice.  You hear the water, and the sun is hitting you, and you're like,  this is so cool.  This is, you know, nice and warm, and there's something under there.  I think I felt something brush my leg.  And then you lose your mind.  You feel something brush your leg.  You can't get your legs out of the water.  And then you get back on the boat, and why are you back in the boat right now?  I was coming back for a beer.  Yeah, I was getting cold. 
[00:58:00]  You remember a dragonfly buzz your head when you're in a lake?  There's nothing worse than dragonflies.  They're just creepy and awful.  Yeah, well, then you go underwater.  And then when you pop up, he's right there waiting for you.  But then I wanted to kind of confront my fear, so I, like, try to do a dive off the boat.  Yeah.  And just knowing maybe I went 10, 15 feet down tops, and I'm just, like, out of my mind,  scared when I pop up.  Like, get me back on the boat.  I'm an underwater.  And you try to open your eyes.  It's just completely dark.  You're like, what?  This stinks. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, you're forced to, like, open your eyes.  You're like, I've got to see something.  I can't see nothing.  Right.  My eyes are open.  I can't see.  Ah!  Something touched my leg.  And, you know, I know there's no whales in fresh water.  Relax.  But for the story, you know, when you dive like that, you have no idea what could be literally  a foot in front of you.  Oh, imagine just pounding into some big beastie, beastie thing.  You're like, is something just checking me out that's literally a foot away?  I have no idea.  It's just the worst.  There are harmless fish that can be, you know, six feet long. 
[00:59:00]  These big groupers.  You ever see these things?  Yeah.  They're huge.  They look like big bass.  And they're giant.  And they're in the water.  And if I was swimming around and saw this harmless thing swimming, I would lose my mind.  I would drown right there because I would just go, I would freak out.  And it's harmless.  And some people, you see them, you know, they go up and pet them.  No.  Sorry.  Ain't going to happen.  Ain't going to happen.  Petrified. 
[00:59:30]  God, what a faggot.  We went off on a weird tangent there.  Let's say hi to Mike in PA.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing, Jimmy Robinson?  Hello, Mike.  Go Eagles!  Got his cape on and everything.  That's right, buddy.  Hey, I was wondering if, Opie, when you were trying to catch that mouse, if he said stop.  Did you teach him to talk like Bernie with his squirrels?  I was thinking about Bernie.  I was thinking that I've really become a loner.  I don't know what happened.  I used to have a lot of friends and was very social. 
[01:00:00]  But lately, I'm just a loner.  Were you working on your anti-gravity machine?  Isn't he coming in with that soon?  Yeah.  Yeah.  His levitation machine.  I was thinking, I swear to God, I was thinking maybe I should make this mouse my pet.  Have something to do after the show.  That mouse must have hated your apartment.  No furniture to hide behind.  It's going to run along the walls with the wires.  It's getting better.  It's getting better.  It's an awful apartment for a mouse or a guest.  Let's say hi to Frank.  Hey, Frank.  What's up? 
[01:00:30]  Good morning, guys.  Good morning, Frank.  I've got to tell you, and Anthony, I think you and I have had an exchange or two on that  New York radio message board at one point, and it wasn't pleasant because at the time  I was not a fan.  You have just turned me 180 degrees, both of you, and with Jim Norton's contributions.  I'm addicted to the show.  I've got XM on in the car constantly.  I'm listening to the replays during the day at home.  Are you Frank the radio critic?  You got it.  Wow.  Yes, man.  Unbelievable.  How are you doing, Frank? 
[01:01:00]  This guy used to hate us, man.  I used to want to strangle you when I read that stupid New York radio message board.  I'm like, doesn't this guy at least have an open mind?  It's funny.  You know what the problem was?  I didn't feel that what you were doing was appropriate for broadcast air, you know, for  so-called perrestrial radio.  Yeah.  And that I still kind of agree with.  But that said, you guys are more talented than anybody on the radio.  Wow.  The sense of humor, the sometimes dry wit, sometimes in-your-face wit.  The impersonations, the topicality, the spontaneity. 
[01:01:30]  It's just, as far as I'm concerned, you are, you know, the brand new wave of the future.  And, I mean, Stern had his day, but you guys are at the top of your game right now.  Frank, don't forget the hardcore sex.  No, all kidding around the side.  I mean, it's just a delight to listen to you.  I have not, I don't know, in the last time, been able to just drive in my car and laugh  out loud at all the antics and the crazy stuff.  And I have to say, Jim Norton is a major contribution to the program. 
[01:02:00]  We love Jimmy.  Thanks, Frank.  We definitely love Jimmy.  I never thought we'd ever turn Frank, the radio critic, around.  Amazing.  Anyone who doesn't know the New York radio message board, Frank's a big poster.  It's like, to a lot of people, that means nothing.  But this was a guy who did not like the show.  He's the last person you would think would enjoy the show.  And Anthony and him would go at it with posts on this board.  Yep, back and forth with Alan mediating, Alan sniffing the head of the board.  And I actually, it was kind of fun to watch the exchanges.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:02:30]  They would just go on and on with us.  And it would always degrade into me, like calling him an ass tool and bad language.  And he would point out, see, look at that.  And I would always feel like an idiot because I had to resort to cursing.  Yeah, there was one time where I think, Anthony, your only response was,  Tool, Tool, yeah.  Like, yeah, I showed him, Tool.  And then Frank would just be, my point has been made.  My point has been made.  Damn it.  They're immature.  Yeah.  Well, thanks, Frank.  Thanks, Frank.  We appreciate that.  Keep it up, and we're enjoying you out here, guys. 
[01:03:00]  Be good.  Cool, man.  Thanks a lot.  Wow, that's pretty huge, actually.  Yeah, that was great.  That's amazing.  I'm waiting for Bill Donahue from the Catholic League to call.  Hey, I love you guys.  All is for God.  You know, that St. Pat's thing, you know, that really got me pissed.  But I've been listening now, and stuff, it feels really funny.  I loved the Lacey Peterson stuff.  That was great.  Thank you.  Yeah, let's keep it in perspective here. 
[01:03:30]  Let's go to John in New Orleans.  We're going to be in New Orleans.  When?  Soon.  Two weeks?  Less than two weeks.  Super Bowl Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday.  That's right.  Let's go, John.  How you doing this morning, boys?  Pretty good.  You know, yesterday I was listening, and Anthony, I think you have some psychic powers.  Sean Hannity had some woman, Lisa G, on the show.  Who is that woman?  Oh, Lisa G is, she's been...  Can I call her a C?  Why?  We don't know her.  If she had something bad to say about us, I'll laugh openly, because she's been trying 
[01:04:00]  to get a job with us for years.  All she had to say was blah, blah, blah.  Psycho Mark would have more insight than her.  Oh, okay, yeah.  Now, she's a bore, and we weren't interested in, you know, bringing her aboard or any other  woman, quite frankly.  I heard Hannity went to bat for you guys the other day on the air for something.  Hannity, you know...  We have a good relationship with Hannity.  We really have a great relationship with Hannity, you know?  He's a good guy.  He understands what we do, and I understand what he does, that's for sure.  Yeah, he tried to get you guys in there pretty good, and she wouldn't shut up. 
[01:04:30]  Finally, when she shut her mouth, he brought it up, Opie and Anthony, you know, they had  a chance, they rebuilt themselves, you know, they did something stupid, and even they'll  admit, they actually got fired.  Yeah.  So he brought you guys up, and you know, like I guess Anthony said it, every time it comes  up with Hot 97, you guys are tops on the list.  Oh, I know.  We got mentioned along with that one.  Awesome.  You're the measuring stick.  You're the standard.  I know.  I'm just waiting for us to...  Waiting for them to drag our names into the whole Tsunami song, which, quite frankly,  I'm not going to lie, yeah, great. 
[01:05:00]  More publicity for us.  I don't care.  You know, I'm surprised they haven't dragged us into that yet.  I just hope no one gets confused and thinks we wrote it, not because it's offensive, because  it's just an awful song parody.  Yeah.  It doesn't rhyme.  Oh, is that an awful parody?  Yeah, why don't we take a break?  We'll talk about the Tsunami song.  It's all over the news.  It's heating up, and there's a rumor that the morning show is suspended today.  If that's true, that means it's just...  A matter of time.  Oh, yeah.  Within a day or two that a few of them, if not the whole show, is fired.  We know this.  Yeah. 
[01:05:30]  We know this game.  I've seen it, been through it a couple of times, so we'll have to see if they're going  to survive or be tossed out on their asses.  How about one more from Hasey Dixie as we go to break here, Anthony?  Highway to hell, or you shook me all night long.  Yeah, highway to hell.  Highway to hell.  Good call, Ben.  Good call.  All right.  Who's here?  We got Pat from Munaki.  Is that him?  There he is.  He just looked in and smiled.  We invited Pat from Munaki in. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, Pat.  And the gal from Survivor is here.  Which Survivor?  Survivor.  No, which one?  She won, didn't she?  Survivor.  Oh, no.  Jenna.  Did she win the latest one?  No one knows.  No one knows who our guests are.  I haven't won Survivor in years.  I know.  You're a big Survivor fan.  I used to be.  I used to be.  Hey, when she comes in, can I try my impressions on her?  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  I better try.  I used to be.  Which one?  She won.  Yeah, she won.  She won Survivor.  The last one.  Oh, the latest one?  Yeah.  So we have to care, right? 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  I don't know.  You got Pat out there, too.  I mean, he's an A-list guest.  I saw the first three Survivors, but, you know.  All right.  But she's turning down the radio before the delay.  It's okay.  Also, Pat brought a bunch of gifts.  He brought Steve a gift.  He brought, you know.  Oh, we love gifts.  I'm sold.  By the way, Kevin from Buffalo.  We don't need to go to the phone.  It was Lake Ontario, not Erie.  I'm sorry, Kevin.  Oh, it was?  Yeah, I'm sorry.  What, were you and Weezwood bathing stuff?  Shut up.  I don't know how he says it.  Dude, I don't mean anything.  There's nothing wrong with two guys going out to the middle of the lake, stripping down 
[01:07:00]  and soaping up a little bit.  Soaping up.  Cleaning up.  Getting those hard-to-reach spots.  Yeah.  Sure.  Hey, you go under and clean me.  I'll go under and clean you.  What the hell?  It's a lake.  Here's some...  Eyes rolled back white, and he goes, oh.  Let's drink to your bag.  All right, all right, all right.  Here's a...  Hey, I hope when she comes in, what do you think Jack Nicholson would say to her?  Dixie.  I'm going to do my Nicholson impression when she comes in.  Are you?  Oh, yeah, it's great. 
[01:07:30]  All right, cool.  I can't wait to hear that.  Living easy, living free.  Seizing ticket on a one-way ride.  Asking nothing, leave me be.  Taking everything in my stride.  Don't need reasons, don't need rhyme.  There ain't nothing that'd rather do. 
[01:08:00]  I'm going down, it's party time.  Yeah, my friend's gonna play their kill.  I'm on the highway to hell.  Highway to hell.  Highway to hell.  Highway to hell.  No stop signs, speed limits.  Nobody gonna slow me down.  Like a wheel, go spinnin'. 
[01:08:30]  Nobody gonna mess me around.  Hey, Satan.  I hate my beast.  I'm playing in this bluegrass band.  Hey, mama.  Look at me.  I'm on my way to the promised land.  Yee-haw.  I'm on my highway to hell.  Highway to hell.  Highway to hell.  Highway to hell.  Highway to hell. 
[01:09:00]  Don't stop me.  On my way to hell.  I'm on my way to hell.  And I'm on the highway to hell  And I'm on the highway to hell  And I'm on the highway to hell  And I'm going down 
[01:09:30]  The pride of the Serengeti, Opie and Anthony. 
[01:10:00]  Spring training is only 36 days away.  And XM Satellite Radio is counting down to the opening of the 2005 baseball season  with some of the greatest play-by-play calls of all time.  Like this one.  It's a grounder past the second baseman into right field.  Ichiro Suzuki fields the ball and makes an amazing throw to get the lead runner at third.  Here's the call from Dave Niehaus.  Here comes a 3-2 pitch on the way.  Swung on and a ground ball punched into right field for a base hit. 
[01:10:30]  So heading to third base is long the throw to third base.  And they've got him nailed at third base on a tremendous throw by Ichiro.  I'm here to tell you that Ichiro throws something out of Star Wars down there.  I'm Bob Edwards inviting you to catch every inning and every team  from spring training to the World Series.

[01:11:30]  It's everything 24-7.  XM 202.  The O&A virus.  It's everything all the time.  Ian Anthony, XM 202.  Now, this looks like a job for me, so everybody just follow me,  because we need a little controversy, because it feels so empty without me.  I said, this looks like a job for me, so everybody just follow me, 
[01:12:00]  because we need a little controversy, because it feels so empty without me.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony program.  That wasn't bad, right?  No, it was like a beatbox.  It started out as a stutter, and I turned it into something nice.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  A couple things really fast.  Let's say hi to Todd the Trucker.  Todd, what's up?  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, Jimmy.  Hi, Todd the Trucker.  Hey, I've got that audio at home. 
[01:12:30]  I'll be home in a couple hours if you want me to send it to the program of  Hannity and Combs last night, mentioning you guys.  You guys were not mentioned on O'Reilly.  He was talking about the tsunami parody.  He didn't mention you guys, but he did mention Jim Norton, and he said that Jim Norton was  going to be at the Combi Works January 28th and 29th in Albany, New York.  I cannot believe you get these guys to plug for you.  That was so good.  Dude, I appreciate that, but they said that O'Reilly forgot to mention the number, which 
[01:13:00]  is 518-689-0490 this Friday, Saturday.  Good call, sir.  Thank you very much.  Wow, that was smooth.  Talk to you guys later.  That was smooth.  He caught me off guard.  I'm like, how the hell did O'Reilly know I was going to be there?  So I guess Hannity and Combs were talking about the tsunami song and other DJs that got  screwed up.  Got screwed up, I guess, huh?  Speaking of which, we have audio of Norton doing the comedy plugs.  It's pretty funny.  Really?  Yeah, we'll try to play it a little later.  We have lots of show to do today, though.  Bob, what's going on? 
[01:13:30]  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, dear, Pat.  Just wanted to let you know CNN's getting ready to play that tsunami song.  Really?  Let's switch over to CNN.  Why?  What did they say on the tease?  I just caught a preview of it on CNN when I was flipping around.  Yeah.  And they said that they didn't tell you who yet, but there was a radio station in New York  that found it funny and amusing to play song parodies of the tsunamis.  The way they word it, too.  They found it.  They didn't get ready to play a clip of it.  The way the news words these events makes it even worse because they're like, you know, 
[01:14:00]  a radio station thinks that a quarter million people drowning is funny.  We'll tell you who it was.  Yeah.  It's like, wait a minute.  I wrote a dopey song parody, you know?  We were on this very early.  It's going to end really ugly for the fine folks at Hot 97 here in New York City.  Anthony and I believe that pretty much the entire show is going to get fired.  Yeah.  We know.  Well, I don't know for sure because I don't really talk to him much these days, but our 
[01:14:30]  old producer, Rick, we're convinced, wrote the song.  He's on lead vocals.  Right.  And I was thinking, man, Rick, didn't you learn from what happened with us with the Sex  for Sam thing?  Just don't put yourself out there like that.  It's undefendable.  It's undefendable.  It's just there's no defense for screaming chinks in a song parody.  It just doesn't wash with the media.  And the latest we're hearing, I'm not sure if it's true, that the morning show got suspended 
[01:15:00]  or something?  Did they?  Somebody was on the line.  We couldn't get to them saying that the show was suspended.  Well, you guys always talk, and you're right, about how awful management is in these situations.  And I'm reading the apology, or I'm looking at the apology they issued, and it's just  such an awful, sanitized wording.  There's nothing human about the wording.  If they came out and go, look, what we did was, it was appalling.  We're sorry.  We was trying to be funny, and it was just terrible.  I mean, there's a way to word things where people go, all right, well, that sounds kind 
[01:15:30]  of sincere.  We try to be funny.  Sometimes we miss the mark.  Yes, we missed it by 220,000 people.  We apologize that the drowning children wasn't as amusing as we had originally anticipated.  Yeah, exactly.  What are you thinking?  We thought God cleansing of all people in Indonesia would be kind of a...  Right, Rip Tickler.  Hey, man, I understand people going, what are you talking about, Ope?  But seriously, what were they thinking?  And that's coming from us.  Yeah.  We know how to get pretty edgy and crazy.  Duh.  See, when we would put song parodies together or get song parodies from our listeners and 
[01:16:00]  play them, it was under the banner of most offensive song contest.  Remember when we did that?  Sure.  We presented this as the most offensive song.  Write one, record one, and send it in.  And then we played them, warning everyone every two seconds, remember, this is the most  offensive song contest, so the purpose of it is to be offensive.  Yep.  And by doing that, we got away with playing probably some of the worst, most offensive songs 
[01:16:30]  ever.  Ever.  Ever.  And, yeah, we were safe.  Yeah.  We were safe.  It has to be a great parody, I think.  For it to fly at all, it has to be a great parody.  When people look at it and go, all right.  No, it's all about that subject matter.  No, honestly, it doesn't matter if it's a great parody.  It's all in the way you present it.  It's all in the presentation.  It's all in the presentation.  It's all in the context.  If you're saying right off the bat, listen how horrible this is, then you could get away  with it.  We're letting people in on a big secret here. 
[01:17:00]  I was talking to Jimmy at breakfast yesterday at the show going, what amazes me about things  is, okay, the tsunami song that Hot 97 did, which is honestly, if they're listening, really  hacky and it's just awful.  It's not entertaining at all.  It's hack stuff that a college radio station might play, okay?  But they're getting a lot of attention.  And I'm hoping that they have balls over there to protect the morning show and let them slide.  Because if they do, they're going to get huge ratings here in New York City. 
[01:17:30]  Absolutely huge ratings.  But I think they're going to pussy out like every other radio company does and they're  going to fire the whole gang, okay?  But with that said, so they play the tsunami song and there's outrage everywhere.  We've been playing the tsunami song every day.  The reason we could get away with it is because now we're presenting it as news.  But it's still the same song that is pissing off a lot of people.  There's no outrage?  But like I said, it's all in the presentation.  Now we're saying, look how awful this song is. 
[01:18:00]  And now it's a news event for us.  So we're allowed to get away with it.  Another example of that was the whole Janet Jackson thing at the Super Bowl last year.  Janet Jackson does her thing.  Everyone is outraged, right?  But then the news channels played it hundreds and hundreds of times, presenting it as news  and the setup and the presentation.  So they were allowed to show it again, which is probably pissing off parents and children  all over the world again.  But it's okay.  But it's okay.  Right.  Because you're presented as news.  It's how it's presented. 
[01:18:30]  Exactly.  Well, do you know, I happen to have a little bit of a news clip of the way the news spoke  about the Hot 97 song and it wasn't good.  They weren't particularly complimentary.  No.  I watched this last night.  I really felt bad.  Because, you know, obviously we all know Rick and I like Todd's a buddy of mine who was  on the show.  Yeah.  Bad.  Not good.  We just, I just know Rick wrote most of that song because he's on lead vocals.  He's just so proud and he's just belting it out.  We were always commenting on how over the top Rick is. 
[01:19:00]  And I'm just waiting for our names to get dragged into it.  Yeah.  The producer of the Tsunami song, Little Known Fact, was also the producer of Opie and Anthony  when they did their sex for Sam's done at St. Patrick's Cathedral back in 2002.  If they get fired, then you'll really see the floodgates open.  Dude, our names will be dragged in because it'll be like, here's other stupid things that  shock jocks have done.  It wasn't the first time either for Opie and Anthony.  They were fired in Boston by saying the mayor. 
[01:19:30]  All right.  We get it.  Mayor Diddy Bum.  We got some news on the Boston mayor.  We'll get to that a little later.  But, all right, yeah, here's the news clip that Jimmy brought in.  The Tsunami Killing an Astounding 212,000.  Wait a minute.  That's not a real fucking, a real newsman, is it?  That's how, that is a real news guy?  That's how I joke say Tsunami every time I say Tsunami.  Tsunami.  Wait, is that the first part of the clip?  I hope you got the whole thing. 
[01:20:00]  They just announced on the air that the show is gone.  The morning show is completely gone.  Fired?  It says suspended indefinitely.  We are looking for a replacement.  They're just playing music and some other stuff.  Fired.  There's a guy.  Fired.  He sounds like an office guy.  He's on the air right now just reading this prepared statement saying the morning show  is gone.  Suspended indefinitely.  Suspended indefinitely.  Fired.  Fired, fired, fired, fired.  Fired, fired, fired.  Totally, completely could not be more fired.  So fired.  And what they could have done is they could have let the morning show, because that song 
[01:20:30]  got played four days in a row.  You got to dump the PD or the GM because management could have stopped that.  Isn't it funny?  They were on the air after it happened.  It worked.  It's textbook.  We know this.  We've seen exactly how this works.  We know this game.  This happened to us twice.  You're fired.  You're fired.  By the way, you know, when we get fired a third time, that will be it for the O.P.  and Anthony program.  You're fired.  On their station right now, they're also playing the Asian Kids rebuttal song. 
[01:21:00]  What?  We have a copy of it right here.  Oh, please.  There's an Asian Kids rebuttal song?  Yep.  All right.  So why don't we go back to the news clip?  This is a news guy sounding really hacky.  He's awful.  I got to hear the Asian Kid rebuttal later.  Let's not forget that.  It sounds like a morning DJ.  Good morning.  Good morning.  The tsunami.  The tsunami.  The tsunami.  The tsunami.  The tsunami killing an astounding 212,000 and leaving 6,200 others missing, with families 
[01:21:30]  torn apart, leaving children orphaned, and with a worldwide relief effort underway, who  would poke fun at this?  Oh, no.  Never good.  Oh, no.  Did you hear the wind-up?  The wind-up.  Oh, that's a Roger Clemens fastball right down the pipe.  The guy with no.  You're not hitting that one, man.  List all the devastation and then follow it with, who could find this funny? 
[01:22:00]  Never a good segue.  I'm surprised it didn't include, like, broken beach chairs.  Like, every possible thing that bad happened, he was throwing in there.  Oh, no.  Effort underway.  Who would poke fun at this?  You better run or get your f*** away.  Go find your money.  The answer, hip-hop radio station WQHT, known as Hot 97.  The station's morning DJ, known as Miss Jones, aired an insulting song that included racial 
[01:22:30]  slurs at Asians and had lyrics about God laughing at those who ground in the waves.  That's terrific.  You can hear God laughing sweet.  Ricky!  Rick made it into the news.  Our old bros.  Rick made it.  How bad is it?  First of all, wait a minute.  We know this.  How bad is it to sit there and watch the news when it's about you and have them playing  the incriminating clips?  It is so awful to sit and watch. 
[01:23:00]  You watch with, like, half through your fingers, with your hands over your ears.  It's painful.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, you'll hear our old producer, Rick, just belting out the next line.  I'm laughing at those who drowned in the waves.  You can hear God laughing, swim, you b****** swim.  Jameson Gong, with the Organization of Chinese Americans, says Asian Americans are outraged. 
[01:23:30]  People from all over the community talk about what to do, rallies, protests, sending letters  to the FCC.  The station, owned by MS Communications, aired the song four days before pulling it.  Calls to station management were not returned, but on the station's website, this statement  was posted.  Hot 97 regrets the airing of material that made light of a serious and tragic event.  We apologize to our listeners and anyone who was offended.  All right, listen, really fast, I heard FCC, the FCC mention in that clip, calm down with 
[01:24:00]  the FCC.  It's not an actionable offense by the FCC.  Oh, there's more about that.  There's more about that.  You're right.  This is not an FCC violation, and this is the problem.  Bad taste.  You don't want it on the radio.  You know, I'm not going to really argue that.  Whatever.  That's what you think.  That's fine.  But as far as getting the FCC involved, nope.  Sorry.  That's not what the FCC's for.  City Council member John Liu would like to see federal action. 
[01:24:30]  How?  Clearly, if the FCC can levy a $550,000 fine for a wardrobe malfunction, they certainly  can address this kind of absolute indecency.  What an ass.  The guy has no clue.  It's not indecency.  Two different issues, you ass.  God.  Tasteless.  Stick to the issue.  You were offended by it.  It offended a lot of people.  For some reason, if the company, Amos, doesn't want to employ people that do these types 
[01:25:00]  of things, they have a reason to fire them.  But as far as federal fines and the FCC being involved, no.  Not a leg to stand on.  No.  You can't start fining people for this type of content.  You can't.  How would you?  You couldn't do a show.  It's bad enough, the sex stuff that has to be, you've got to weave in and out of things  in order to even get some type of adult-oriented conversation on regular radio without being fined. 
[01:25:30]  That's bad enough.  If you start making content that offends, what about it?  You get a right-wing political talk show is completely offending liberals and vice versa.  You know, you listen to Air America, it's completely offending Republicans and conservatives.  What are they going to complain now?  I'm offended.  I find this indecent.  I find what he is saying about welfare reform indecent.  Find them.  Well, you're insane.  In Canada, this would be an affinable offense for that reason. 
[01:26:00]  They are so, they really are like socialist mentality up there.  I mean, I love Canada.  I know I crapped on him the other day, but this is the type of stuff that you can't play  because it's offensive to a certain group of people racially.  It's just revolting.  Yeah.  I mean, the guy has every right to be pissed off because, you know, his peeps are being  offended by this song and there's racial slurs in the song.  So he could be offended.  He could do what he did. 
[01:26:30]  You know, speak out.  Have the company fire them.  But as far as having the FCC involved, calm down.  Just calm down.  We kind of stand by its talent, though.  I mean, didn't they fire Star and Buckwild with the first ones they fired off 97 and  then these guys?  I said, come on.  Sometimes you've got to stand by the radio talent.  This is, it's an automated process with these radio companies.  It is an automated process.  It is so predictable that a machine might as well do it.  Dude, I would love.  We knew exactly how this was going to play out. 
[01:27:00]  I would love to see the radio station or the company itself, you know, stand by these  guys.  But honestly, this is a tough one, man.  And this is coming from us.  It's just a tough one.  You've got the whole effing world focused on this thing.  If they just ignored everybody and let them do their show in a week, two weeks, this would  be over.  Go away.  Old news and done with.  For some reason, these companies cannot grasp that concept.  They knee-jerk.  They panic. 
[01:27:30]  They see it showing up on the news.  And they think it's going to turn into something.  It doesn't.  It doesn't turn into something.  People can say, boycott the advertisers.  A few will get calls.  A couple might even pull their ads.  But you know something?  As time goes by, they get them back.  Other people come in.  They forget about it.  And it will go away.  The worst thing they do is exactly what they do.  Knee-jerk.  They let them get on the air for a couple of days after it happens. 
[01:28:00]  And then the hoopla starts.  The media picks up on it.  It snowballs like we were talking about.  And then the company freaks out, pulls them off the air.  Textbook.  And an awful apology.  An insincere management apology.  Most apologies, when celebrities in general mess up and you get the apologies on TV, just  about every single one of those apologies is a joke.  It really is.  It's written by a lawyer.  Written by a lawyer.  There's no real feeling or emotion.  No sincerity.  There's nothing to do with the actual person that's in trouble.  Jay Leno's Johnny speech was more sincere. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  Exactly.  If you're going to make an apology, like I had to apologize recently for something.  And so you don't have somebody else write it.  You just tell the person, look, I'm sorry.  It was dark.  You were on your stomach.  I didn't realize it was the wrong one.  I apologize.  I should have stopped when you were crying, but it felt a little too good.  The BM one.  But right.  You know, getting to the heart of the subject, though, man.  I mean, you know, it was just stupid.  Yeah.  In this day and age, I mean, we got fired.  We were on top of our game. 
[01:29:00]  We were.  No.  It's written out now on CNN.  The lyric.  Hey, it's Rick's lyric.  You can hear this.  It's written out.  Little Chinese swept away.  You can hear God laughing.  Swim.  You bitches.  Swim.  Swim.  Oh, they're so done.  CNN.  Oh, the Cafferty file.  I'm sure he's just really, really enjoying this.  He's even styling his hair like O'Reilly, this boar.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Kevin in Jersey.  Kevin.  Hey, how's it going, guys? 
[01:29:30]  Hey.  All right.  I was just flipping over there, and they had some guy, Jim, from the Rough Riders, who's  supposed to be an Asian-American, just had a rap that just completely bashed the Miss  Jones or whatever her name is.  Really?  We think we have a song here, which is a rebuttal.  We got it.  We're going to do both right now.  Because Asian rap is a really hot seller on Hot 97, you groveling idiots, Emmis.  Well, what I was trying to say, what were they thinking, I mean, with the climate of  radio, and you and I losing our jobs on the top of our game, should have sent out 
[01:30:00]  a signal to everyone.  No one's safe.  No one's safe, and they don't have ratings to begin with.  Okay, whatever.  So, you know, it was just-  They're doing a CNN poll.  How should they be punished?  Yeah.  Our names are coming soon, boys and girls.  This is great stuff.  Time to drag Opie and Anthony back in.  Great stuff.  They're going to fucking fire these guys.  That really does bug me.  It was a bad choice by them, but management, look, didn't let it play for four days.  Just stayed.  And I hope Starnbuck Wild murder that station if you fire them. 
[01:30:30]  You're going to lose.  Look what happened to N.E.W., you asses.  I know.  They dumped the one show, and the point was raised yesterday.  If you guys can get dumped, anybody can get dumped.  There's no way they're going to be protected if you guys weren't protected.  Just stupid.  Millions of dollars the station lost.  Millions.  Poor Rick.  Poor Rick, man.  Yeah, man.  I feel bad for him.  You know, it's the worst, just going through this stuff multiple times.  Right, right.  And Rick is not management.  He didn't say four days in a row you could play it.  Yeah. 
[01:31:00]  Who's this?  He just wrote it.  Hello?  Hello?  Yeah.  What's up?  Go ahead.  Who's this?  Hey, this is nonstop.  I'm a truck driver.  All right.  What's up, nonstop?  How you doing?  Hey, I got your guys' subscription here and all that.  I'm listening to your show right now.  Hey, I think you guys should start using a little more profanity.  Do you?  Yeah.  Why is that, sir?  I don't know.  I just think your show's gotten a little more important.  I noticed you guys lately, but you've been cutting back on the profanity. 
[01:31:30]  All right, well, we want the listeners to cut back a little, too.  It's not all about just cursing.  That isn't what the freedom of satellite radio is all about, and we've said that many times.  It's not just about being able to get on and curse.  It's about being able to discuss anything we want.  The listeners are the biggest violators of it.  You guys call up, and every other word is F this, and it completely takes away from the conversation.  We curse when it fits. 
[01:32:00]  It's an awful thing to make for an interesting conversation.  Yeah, and that's when we throw it in, when it fits.  It's a self-policing thing, because, again, we fall into the trap.  I'm human.  I just overuse it.  All right.  Hey, go hit a fucking tree.  Yeah.  You silly goose.  Forgive me.  I didn't mean to get so rough.  I understand.  You beat me to it.  That was like a softball pitch.  Well, I don't like that type of language when I have my young son, Drew Boogie, in the car. 
[01:32:30]  All right.  Listen.  Poor Rick, man.  So he's flipping out right now, I'm sure.  Yeah, but it was just stupid, man.  Well, so is sex for Sam.  We understand.  Honestly, we didn't think we'd get fired at the time, because the climate of radio was such  that if you're bringing in huge ratings and making a lot of money for the company, they're  not going to get fired over that.  You didn't get fired.  But now, yeah.  But now, after we got fired, that sent out a signal to everyone, watch your ass.  And Bubba and the regular guys, they dumped a lot of people all over the country. 
[01:33:00]  You can't be writing a tsunami song thinking that you're going to be safe is all I'm saying.  I mean, if you want to write a tsunami song, go for it.  But I'm thinking, as a radio guy, you know, this could be the thing that could get us  fired again.  And I don't feel like getting fired anytime soon.  No, I'd kind of like to have a job for a little while.  I want to put in another two years, and then we'll get fired, and then we'll retire.  Yeah, swim, you bitches.  Swim.  Waterdoodle.  The tsunami. 
[01:33:30]  Watch the tree go through her head.  Little chinksy.  I apologize.  Yeah, I see.  Waterdoodle.  Bone dry.  No one's bone dry after the tsunami.  Yeah, I agree.  You guys wouldn't get in trouble for a song like that because it's just, you wouldn't,  the difference is you're not groveling if they complain about it.  You just go drop dead and hang up.  You wouldn't get in trouble for that.  Well, I don't know.  Plus you're not terrestrial.  All right, well, here's the big difference.  Here's the song that everyone is outraged about, Anthony. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, you're going to play the outrage song?  Yeah.  The tsunami song, and then we'll play the Asian response?  Yeah, we'll have to do that.  And it's all in the setup, so I want to make it perfectly clear that this is the song that  a lot of people are outraged by.  Absolutely.  A lot of people, a lot of the news agencies are playing the song now, but they are bleeping  it, and we have the ability to play it uncensored.  So do they.  It's not offensive FCC-wise.  Yeah, I know, but they don't want to offend people.  So let's just say that...  The way Rick wrote it to be played is the way we play it. 
[01:34:30]  We don't agree with this type of thing, so if you're pretty much an expressionless-faced  individual, you may not like it, so turn your radio or radio, turn your radio off.  Oh, that is not appropriate at all.  It really isn't.  Jimmy, here's the song.  Frank the Radio Critic's going to be mad.  We are the world.  Tsunami.  I'm shaped like the world.  Tsunami of vomit out of my mouth. 
[01:35:00]  Just look at them off their face, guys.  No, I love the kids.  There was a time when the sun was shining bright, so I went down to the beach to catch me  a tan.  Then the next thing I knew, oh, wave 20 feet high, I came and washed your whole country away. 
[01:35:30]  And all at once, you could hear the screaming chains, and no one was safe from the wave.  Todd, fired.  There were Africans drowning.  Miss Jones, fired.  Why not use a slur there? 
[01:36:00]  You could hear God laugh and swim, you bitches.  Swim!  Rick, fired.  Yes, you are.  It's the tsunami.  You better run or kiss your ass away.  Go find your mommy.  Go find your mommy!  I just saw a blow by.  A tree went through a head.  And now your children will be sold.  Child slavery. 
[01:36:30]  You're fired!  So now you're screwed.  It's the tsunami.  You better run or kiss your ass away.  Go find your mommy.  It's over, Johnny.  I just saw her float by.  A tree right through her head.  You little scumbag!  And now your children will be sold.  Child slavery.  You're fired.  So now you're screwed. 
[01:37:00]  So now you're screwed.  It's the tsunami.  It's the tsunami.  It's the tsunami.  It's the tsunami.  You better run or kiss your ass away.  Go find your mommy.  You better run or kiss your ass away.  That's an erect.  I just saw her float by.  A tree went through her head.  And now your children will be sold.  In child slavery.  What is your problem?  Do we?  I pay for all the kids.  The little Indonesian kids.  The little Asian kids.  The Chinese kids. 
[01:37:30]  The black.  Well, not the black kids.  But the white kids.  The Puerto Rican kids.  I love them more.  I'll pay for everything.  I promise.  I won't touch them.  Bubbles.  Come on.  Let's get these kids.  I love the kids.  Let's save the world.  Let's please save the world.  Please help us out.  Tsunami.  We're coming to help you.  All you kids.  We love you.  What is your problem?  You insensitive asshole.  God.  God.  Damn it.  Are you fucking with me?  It's over, Jenny.  It is so over.  You're fired.  You're fired. 
[01:38:00]  Fire.  Wow.  I never realized how much fun this is.  Because usually it's us.  Listening.  Listening to other people's radio shows.  Like we knew what happened when we got the boot.  Other people were really having a lot of fun and sport with it.  They sure were.  And is this what it feels like?  A little bit.  Now I can appreciate it.  Greg, real fast.  Yeah.  How are you doing?  Two things.  The tsunami just took.  The death toll just went up another five.  And also, I hear that Psycho Mark is on Fox News telling the intricate details about this. 
[01:38:30]  Where they're going to be turning up and what happened.  Yeah.  The boys are fine and they got another job.  Yes.  Miss Jones is negotiating right now.  They were number one in New York and Indonesia and Southeast Asia.  Very good.  Greg.  What a dolt.  All right.  So where's Eric?  So now we have, what is this Asian rap thing?  From what I hear, it's what Hot 97 is playing. 
[01:39:00]  It was some Asian response.  Oh, okay.  Response to the tsunami song.  To the tsunami song.  All right.  Here he comes on.  And to that morning show.  Boss, why don't you?  Yeah.  Any background on this song?  Who did it?  It was just emailed to Steve this morning that-  Is it a Drew Boogie song?  This Asian rapper took it upon himself to make a response.  And apparently leaked all over the internet.  So they're playing it now.  So we should play it.  Okay.  That's true.  It's the only time that Jin is getting any airplay on Hot 97. 
[01:39:30]  So it's his chance to kind of-  Yep.  You know what I'm saying?  Who is Jin?  Jin is an Asian rapper.  He's made songs before.  But they didn't get any airplay.  Oh, so now they're giving him airplay?  Of course.  Now he's getting his chance.  This obviously isn't him, is it?  I don't know.  I haven't heard it.  But if it's Jin, he's a good rapper.  But now he gets his chance.  Right.  Now it's going to be like the Asian rap station over there to try to make up for it.  Let the Asians make fun a little bit and then everyone will be happy?  I guess so.  Oh, boy. 
[01:40:00]  Home of hip-hop and R&B.  Yeah, right.  What a joke.  Uh-huh.  What's hip-hop about being racist and being ignorant, huh?  What?  Always.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know.  When has hip-hop been about being racist?  Have you ever listened to it, you jackass?  Being racist and being ignorant?  Oh, my God.  Since it was its inception?  That's when since?  After the Sugar Hill Gang, it's all been downhill and cop killing and white people stink.  Jesus Christ.  Are you that deluded?  Come on.  You know, I can understand being upset at what they played, the Tsunami song. 
[01:40:30]  But let's not be silly here.  Yo, since when has hip-hop been about being racist?  I don't know.  Since Eric B. and Rakim in the ghetto and there's a whole thing about how white people were born  in caves and they were exiled from the original man.  Stupid.  Oh, my God.  Are you an ass?  That's what it was based in.  It was based in a response to what was angry.  Right.  And it came out racist a lot of times.  Of course it did.  I'm not saying all of it, but it's always had that tone to it.  After the Sugar Hill Gang, it's been all down. 
[01:41:00]  I said a hip-hop, a hippity, a hippity, a hippity, I don't want to offense nobody.  A hip-hopper, you don't stop, you're rocking.  Floating on by with a stick in the head.  I said a hip, a hop, a hippity, a hop.  A hip, hop, hippie up the beach real quick because a big wave's coming.  Sometimes I'm going under.  Yeah, well, the guy's delusional.  We're never going to do this song, no. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, right.  What a joke.  When was hip-hop about being racist and being ignorant, huh?  So don't take a minute.  Tell me that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm only going to say this once.  Once.  Yeah.  Somebody got to say it.  What?  Check it.  Talk to him.  You got it twisted.  If you think I'm here to cock block on a bunch of no-talent wannabe shop jocks.  Nah.  And they say it's all freedom of speech.  Well, you just lost yours.  Read them and weep.  Won't be happy till you're fired.  My people's is pissed, homes. 
[01:42:00]  And I bet you not, and so will Miss Jones.  Miss who?  My point is, Zach.  And tell the rest of your staff that they need to clean up their act.  Fuck the tsunami song and whoever thought of it.  Matter of fact, fuck the engineer that recorded it.  And the brains behind the scenes that applauded it.  Anything for ratings, huh?  This shit is corporate.  God damn it.  That little bullshit statement has got to be the world's most half-assed apology.  Could keep thousands of still getting discovered each day.  How dare you compare a life to a week's pay? 
[01:42:30]  Come on.  Interesting.  Y'all quick to have a smack fest.  But those that really need to ain't get slapped yet.  And it's rare that I'm even rapping pissed.  Jen is far from a human rights activist.  Can I say, I despise this Eminem ripoff.  What is he going to sing next?  I'm Srim Shady.  You stink and you're not original.  What?  He's an Eminem ripoff from the voice.  Not really.  You know something?  Eminem kind of projects himself at still being a white guy when he raps. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  This guy, I mean, you could say everything you want, but you're really ripping off a culture  by doing this type of music.  He's rapping and really putting on the whole black thing.  He's ripping off a culture's music type to bash people of that culture in song.  I don't get it.  His whole persona, his whole inflection is Eminem.  That's exactly what it is.  Can we go to the rap expert, please, Drew Boogie?  All right.  Drew Boogie. 
[01:43:30]  Well, he...  I think he's got some skills.  He does have skills.  He's not ripping off anything.  He's probably been hanging around black kids all his life.  I think the whole thing is ripping off the culture.  No, Eminem, I mean, he's ripping off.  His voice is so completely...  His inflection, everything he's doing is Eminem.  Oh, that's true.  Here's what I feel, personally.  If you're not black and you sound like this, you're ripping off a culture.  It's not...  No, no, because I've heard the things before through history, like the white man's ripping  off the black man's music and stuff.  So, rock and roll was adapted by white people and... 
[01:44:00]  From blues, yeah.  Yeah, and it just...  It comes off sounding like white people doing rock music, and we enjoy it.  We love it.  Everybody loves it.  Black people doing rock, it's fine.  White people doing rock, fine.  But this type of music, to get on...  It's an imitation.  It's an Asian guy doing a black man imitation.  I could never get into this when white guys or Asian guys and stuff are just putting  on this imitation of black people.  Yeah, but this is a black dialect, a black accent, if you will. 
[01:44:30]  And it doesn't come across as sincere or honest.  It sounds silly to me.  Well, you can tell, but he's one of those guys that's been probably hanging around black  people all his life, so that's all he knows.  You think?  Yeah.  Yeah, when you go...  It happens.  In prison, I mean, the accent, you can't tell the difference between black guys and white  guys a lot of times, I mean, except for the Aryans.  But I mean, I think it all depends on where you're raised.  Like, I think you're right.  This guy is probably just putting on a little...  He's putting on his hip-hop face.  But there are guys that are raised in certain areas that just speak a certain way because  that's what they were raised with.  I just can't stand it. 
[01:45:00]  I don't like it either because I think it's disingenuous.  When it's honest, I don't mind it.  But if this guy's just trying to get airplay, and he stays...  To me, he's ripping off Eminem.  It's like 50 Cent coming out and doing a Pat Boone song.  I would kind of like that.  I would like to hear that.  You want to hear that?  50 Cent's?  That would be fun to hear.  50 Cent's?  All right.  Is the Survivor girl getting uncomfortable out there?  We'll get her on in a few minutes.  Let's sit with Pat from Monaki.  He was waiting out there.  He could chat with her.  Hey, Survivor, I'm a Survivor, but my toe isn't.  Yeah, Jin is exerting a lot of anger from not getting the light that he wants to get 
[01:45:30]  in general.  Yeah.  Then there's this on top of it where he doesn't like the racial epithet.  All right.  Let's go back to the song.  So don't take this in a political fashion.  Nope.  It's just a good old lyrical passion.  In fact, I'm making it a mission of mine.  Won't stop till every last petition is signed.  Hip-Hop is designed to unify the masses.  And we demand that you be denied the access. 
[01:46:00]  Radio is whack.  Yo, somebody gotta say this.  Same five songs on every single playlist.  And bad karma's the worst way to go.  So I pray that God has mercy on your soul.  What?  Yeah.  Huh?  I mean, you know I was gonna have something to say about this whole situation.  Because for some odd reason, whenever some shit like this happens, in regards to my  peoples, in the society, in the media, it always manages to get swept under the rug.  I'll end up right below the radar for some reason. 
[01:46:30]  What kind of rug?  Oriental?  But let it be any other race and this shit would have been hit the fan.  All my soldiers out there, it's time for our voices to be heard, yo.  It's no more of that shit.  Uh-huh.  But you know I got love for everybody.  Whether you black, white, Hispanic.  That's why I love hip-hop.  Because it'll bring us all together.  I'm just saying.  Don't let it be your peoples that they dissing next time.  Making fun of their tragedies just for a cheap laugh. 
[01:47:00]  You sitting there like, what the fuck?  Know what I'm saying?  So yo, keep them emails going through, man.  Keep them complaint letters going out.  Keep them phone calls going into the radio station and the sponsors.  Telling them how you feel.  And what a fuck-up move they made.  Let them know.  Let them know it's about the people.  And shout out to Miss Info, too.  Keep your head up, ma.  Yeah.  Ma.  Yeah, that's real hip-hop.  Keep them emails coming to the station and the sponsors, yo. 
[01:47:30]  You douchebag.  Turn the bullshit off.  And by the way, hip-hop was made to unify the masses.  No, it wasn't, stupid.  That's exactly the opposite reason of why hip-hop was being done.  You asshole.  It was not done to unify the masses.  No.  Yeah, that's what Cop Killer was about by Ice-T.  Unifying the masses.  Getting folks together.  Good point.  Oh, you are so right, man.  Yeah, that's what Snoop, you know, all the songs he does. 
[01:48:00]  It's all about getting people together and the gang stuff.  Yeah, you're right.  Good point.  Yo, y'all, keep them emails coming.  He can't help but being Asian.  Yo, make sure you get A's in math, yo.  Yo, make sure you walk on that back before you jerk them off at the end, yo.  Yo, keep them baskets from tipping over on the bikes.  And you think that's funny?  His first song was, Y'all Gonna Speak Chinese.  Really?  Yes.  Is that the guy you were talking about?  Gin.  That is Gin.  I don't want to be whack.  And here's the audio from CNN as we try to wrap up this little segment here. 
[01:48:30]  New York radio station Hot 97's in trouble for airing a song parody of the tsunami that was filled with anti-Chinese slurs.  Listen.  Oh, listen.  Killed.  You can hear the screaming tits.  Little tournament swept away.  You can hear God laugh and swim, you bitches swim.  It's pretty funny, right?  200,000 people killed over there.  The song was bad enough.  Then the radio host, some idiot named Tasha Jones, got mad when another newsreader, Miss Info, who is Asian, objected to the Miss Info, objected to the song during a live broadcast. 
[01:49:00]  One of the co-hosts, a clown named Todd Lynn, interjected then saying, I'm going to start shooting Asians.  City council members, Asian-American advocacy groups, furious as they should be.  The song played on the station's morning show for several days, which is a tribute to the wisdom of the management of her at that place.  It was finally pulled on Friday.  The station's owned by MS Communications. 
[01:49:30]  They've apologized, and Miss Jones and her staff have donated a week's salary to the tsunami relief efforts.  Critics say it's not enough.  They want federal fines, a stronger apology, and for the morning show crew to be summarily fired.  Here's the question.  How should the radio station Hot 97 that aired the tsunami song be punished?  One guy said they ought to send them over to the tsunami area where you were for a week or so,  and let them see what happened as a result of this tragedy, and then let them come back and report on how funny they think it is. 
[01:50:00]  They can work it out.  You know, I mean, I think that's right.  But they didn't play the song just once, right?  They played the days, for several days.  I mean, at the risk of saying something inappropriate, I really am just going to say.  Well, you know, the management, what are they thinking about?  I mean, why don't they find them?  I mean, that's not a wardrobe malfunction.  That's a brain malfunction.  Right?  I mean, that's serious stuff.  So we're going to spend the next couple hours beating the hell out of that radio station. 
[01:50:30]  Good.  Hear, hear.  I'm up for it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look how good we are.  Stop.  Douchebags.  Nothing speaks louder than the thought of lost dollars.  The hurtful Hot 97 should lose at least 97 sponsors for their irresponsibility.  This is the letters that are being written.  And be shut off for 97 days for their callous stupidity.  These are letters that are coming into CNN.  Oh, CNN's loving this.  They got something to talk about today.  They love it.  Yeah.  Yeah, they don't give a crap. 
[01:51:00]  Like, they didn't exploit the tsunami by just day after day after day showing bloated dead bodies on the beach.  That's acceptable.  Stop.  Everyone's exploiting everything.  Relax.  Don't be so high and mighty.  Even that stupid rapper was exploiting it.  Really?  You gotta love it.  Of course.  What's up?  Sorry.  Ben threw me a note.  Eric, you got an update here?  Yeah, real quick.  They're playing that song two to three times an hour.  Four, they're interviewing the guy right now, and they're having just an open forum, whether 
[01:51:30]  you're for or against the show being suspended.  That's the whole morning show.  Oh.  They might try to keep these guys.  Really?  They might try to ride it out, man.  Make something of it.  Dude, absolute huge ratings if they keep the show.  I hope and I think they should absolutely keep it because, again, they screwed up.  They apologized.  Move on.  Right.  It's not an FCC violation.  I think that's a big thing that may help them.  I bet your management goes down, and maybe even, unfortunately, Rick, because he was a producer.  But management let it play four days.  I'm sorry.  Miss Jones and Todd don't make that decision over management. 
[01:52:00]  Well, here's a little more audio.  You're fired.  You're not suspended.  You're not on temporary leave.  You're fired.  Ouch.  All right.  Ben was telling me that the survivor girl has to leave at eight.  Oh.  At eight?  Should we get her in here?  We didn't know that.  Ten minutes, huh?  I didn't know.  My arm hair is really...  Trust me, ten minutes is plenty.  My arm hair is really wispy.  All right, bring her in.  I have wispy arm hair.  We're having a really good show, and this could be another...  The breaks.  This could be the cooler. 
[01:52:30]  Hi, Drew.  Hey.  Hey, Drew's coming over on this side.  Hey, Ben, are you in your little short sweatshirt going to open the door?  Look how muscular Ben looks in his tight sweatshirt.  Oh, that's awful.  I actually...  I saw Ben.  I'm like, Ben, are you losing weight, or is that shirt this tight shirt?  Why is your hair red, and you're running around with a knife, killing people?  Ow.  Oh, Chucky.  Sorry for the weight, ladies.  Hi, how are you?  Hi.  We didn't know you had to leave at eight, Jenna.  We were learning how to kill people out there.  Really?  It's really fun.  Oh, Master Poe's teaching you.  Grabbing and pulling groins.  I'm so...  Yeah, we like that.  Master Poe's got to calm down. 
[01:53:00]  Master Poe's our assigned killer, and this was something I wanted to bring up on the air,  and this is a perfect time to do it.  Every person that walks through the door to come into our radio show, they have to listen  to Master Poe talk about how you can defend yourself.  It's like you're walking into Cobra Kai.  It's amazing.  Did the guy outside explain how to do jumping jacks with only nine toes?  The fat man?  Did he happen to...  No, we missed that lesson.  That's Pat from Wunaki.  He's a hack.  He's awful.  And he has diabetes, and they hacked one of his toes off.  Ew, gross.  Yeah, it's really gross. 
[01:53:30]  So what did Master Poe teach you?  We learned how to kill people.  But most excited, we know how to grab and twist and pull the groin area.  I'll be using that one, like, tomorrow.  Is that a self-defense tactic or something for the bedroom?  Well, it depends.  It sounds a little fun.  He teaches people the fishhook and all sorts of things.  Oh, grabbing the mouth and stuff.  He taught you that?  It's like poking the eyes.  Yeah.  Master Poe's all about that.  Every day, he's showing someone how to defend himself.  He teaches everyone. 
[01:54:00]  Everyone that comes in.  Perhaps he should just, you know, let the people fill out the paperwork and not give them  instruction on killing other human beings.  Sorry.  We didn't know you had to leave.  We feel bad.  That's okay.  No one told us.  Yeah.  So, you got other interviews and whatnot?  I guess.  Is that what they do now?  Yeah.  That's what we do now.  You kind of win.  All in one day.  All in one day.  Yeah.  One after another, right?  One after another.  The same stupid questions, right?  What's the question you're asked the most?  Um, was it fun?  Was it fun?  No. 
[01:54:30]  Does it look like fun?  No.  It kind of looks like fun.  No.  It's better than going to work nine to five every day.  Here's the other one you're asked all the time.  Why did you decide to join?  Why did you decide?  Duh, a million dollars.  That's rocket science.  That's nice.  Yeah.  A million bucks, huh?  Yeah.  Are you going to pay taxes on it or be like?  I did.  I'm not.  Be like dummy.  Not like Hatch.  Dumb homo.  That's right.  He's in the house.  What the hell is he doing?  I just saw him, too.  He's in big trouble, right?  He says he's not going to jail, though.  Really?  I'm sure he might like it, though.  He can make that decision for himself?  Yeah.  I'm not going to jail.  He said I'm not going to jail. 
[01:55:00]  No.  Playground for him.  Prison.  Let's hope he doesn't walk around naked in prison.  Yeah.  He's really awful for a gay man.  This guy's in awful shape.  He doesn't have the gay man look to him.  Yeah.  Jim, pull your shirt down and stop scratching, please.  You hear how she laughs at you?  That's okay.  I didn't laugh at you.  I was laughing with you.  He was laughing at you.  That's right.  We can tell when girls are laughing.  We laugh at him every day, but you were laughing.  Were you laughing at his wispy arm hair?  Look how hairless Jimmy is. 
[01:55:30]  Good.  That's gross.  He is like the most hairless guy.  No, I understand.  You don't want a big beaver up your arm, but he's got the wispiest.  Feel that hair.  It's so fine.  It's like cotton candy.  I like it.  Less to get in the way.  Yeah.  You don't like a hairy guy?  You like a guy that shaves?  No, well, there's a fine line.  Yeah, exactly.  There's a fine line between non-hairy and stripper.  Because there's, yeah.  There's guys that actually shave. 
[01:56:00]  We had a discussion on this.  There's guys in the studio that shave.  Their chest hair.  Well, if you have a lot of chest hair.  I trimmed down the chest hair a little bit, and I shaved the package.  Okay.  Not like, I mean, you know, just keep it nice and clean.  That's disgusting, man.  That must be a new thing for guys to like.  It is.  You know what it is?  It's guys watching porno movies going, hey, you know, guys are doing this.  Stop watching porn.  They're not an example.  Porn stars and gay guys are shaving anything down there.  Would you like a nice hairy sack?  No, but it's just, it's not really comfortable to imagine you guys down there, like, you 
[01:56:30]  know, maneuvering around with a razor.  Yeah, with a blade.  Pulling things up.  You've got to be very careful, yeah.  Just not attractive at all.  Yeah, it's awful.  I don't shave.  And that's the first thing we think about when we see it.  We're like, oh, he was shaving.  That's gross.  Yeah, and then it gets in your head like you're picturing him pulling around like silly  putty.  Yeah.  Trying to like get under there.  Like Turkish taffy.  Gross.  Oh, it's disgusting.  Big fruit roll-up stuck to your leg.  No, I will never eat a fruit roll-up again. 
[01:57:00]  No, and you, well, you shouldn't.  So why haven't we seen you naked yet?  I mean, you were in Playboy, right?  Yeah.  Why haven't I seen this yet?  Ooh.  You missed a good issue.  Which issue was it?  August of 2003.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I was too busy, like, hiking the Grand Canyon.  You were too busy shaving.  Right.  That's probably why you missed it.  Grand Canyon.  You look beautiful.  What was the, uh, what was the spread, as they say?  What was the title?  It was a layout.  We don't call it a spread.  You don't call it a spread?  I always liked that it was called a spread.  It was, it wasn't, it was actually pretty tame. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, I see your spread.  Yeah.  Isn't that awful?  Dude, I saw your spread.  I'm like, no, you didn't.  No.  And you never will.  What was the strangest thing about that whole...  Well, doing it with somebody else is always weird.  Because, like, you're trying to be sexy, but you're like, your ass is in my face.  Oh.  It's really not as hot as it seems like it is.  A little awkward.  So you did it with another girl.  Did you know her?  Yeah, she was on Survivor with me.  Oh, I don't...  Oh, wow.  Were you guys on the show when you actually did the shoot or before?  No, we did it right after I won.  The day after.  Was it called the Girls of Survivor or something? 
[01:58:00]  No, it was just called Survivor Girls.  They said, Survivor Girls, clothes get voted off.  Clothes get voted off.  Very clever.  I didn't see it.  My friend saw it.  And he's like, that's really hot.  And I'm like, really?  He's like, yeah.  Okay, cool.  That's cool.  What an ass.  I didn't see it, though, but I watched it.  He gets paid the big bucks to say stuff like that on our show.  They're really cute.  Was that the first time you posed nude, or was it like you took pictures with boyfriends  or anything?  No, I don't know. 
[01:58:30]  Never did that?  No?  Not that I know of.  It's got to be for cash.  Not that I can remember.  Yeah, it's got to be for cash.  If you're going to take it off, you might as well get paid for it.  That's a good idea.  You make a good dime on that?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Because we were really popular at the time.  Oh, at the time?  Why?  What's happening?  No.  We still...  I still am now.  I started my own business.  Okay.  Model Challenge USA.  It's a model search.  Really?  Yeah.  Right.  Well, a lot of the reality people that are on these other reality shows especially...  Yeah, they suck, though.  They really think that they're going to be just huge in entertainment for the rest of  their lives.  That's their problem. 
[01:59:00]  They think that they're a big actor, and you're totally not.  You have 15 minutes, and you better do something with it that's going to make money.  People think, oh, I'm going to be an actress.  No, you're not.  No one really cares.  You're going to go to LA, and you're going to work at the Saddle Ranch, or you're going  to be a waiter.  And it's worse if you didn't win.  And you're going to get tampon commercials or MyDoll commercials.  And then even that goes away, because as soon as the new Survivor starts, and no offense,  the other ones are kind of thrown on the back burner a little bit, right?  You have to kind of do something to make yourself stand out, because there's so many shows on  now.  So that's why I started my business. 
[01:59:30]  And this is a model search?  How does that work?  It's a model challenge, though.  Different venues all over the country will have their own model challenge, and then they'll  pick a winner, and all the winners will come to the finals in October, and we'll crown  them Miss Model Challenge USA, and they'll win a modeling contract, all that jazz.  Because all the people that I met through Survivor are all in the entertainment business, so I'm  like, hey, you want to help out?  Right, right.  Yeah.  My dad always said, the people you see up are the people you see on the way down, so  you've got to be nice to everybody.  Isn't that what Ed Norton said, or Ralph Cramden? 
[02:00:00]  Be kind to the people you meet on the way up, because it's the same people you're going  to meet on the way down.  Because the only place to go from up is back down.  Is down.  Has your lifestyle changed because of the money?  You've got family ragging you for cash?  No, you know what?  I only had one ex-boyfriend who called me and said, I helped you make your video for  Survivor.  Oh, boy.  Just Survivor video.  That's it.  And all he did was hold the camera, and he's like, you should pay for my college.  I'm like, I'm not paying for shit.  How old was this guy?  You were dick.  He's like, I don't even remember, but he sucks. 
[02:00:30]  And I was like, click.  Wow.  But he was the one that kind of filmed for your audition?  He's the only one that called.  Yeah.  Well, he held the camera.  I could have put it on a tripod, for Christ's sake.  And then the tripod will be calling.  Yeah.  Come on.  Give me money.  Yeah.  I held the camera up.  You owe me.  But that's the only person.  I had some people who were like, some random family members who were like, oh, I can't pay  for this.  I'm like, are you trying to ask me to pay for it in a subtle way?  All of a sudden, money conversations come up.  I felt a lot of pressure to get everyone good Christmas gifts that year, though. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  Isn't that a bitch?  Yeah.  Because you can't.  And then you're like, oh, I'm kind of the rich person.  I have to buy.  I can't go to get them a gift certificate to the mall anymore.  I was going to say, yeah, best buy for $50.  That really sucks.  And it's so true.  When we first signed a pretty good contract, $30 million, and the family knows it.  Oh, they expect gifts.  I'm over at grandma's house, and I'm backing in the truck for all the presents that are  coming out, because they expect it.  You can't go buy anybody chocolates anymore.  It's got to be like. 
[02:01:30]  I got you a mug with world's best uncle on it or something.  It better be filled with hundreds, you idiot.  And then you have to outdo yourself the next year.  Yeah, but I didn't.  I went with like, I'm very inconsistent with my gifts.  I got my sister a big screen television, you know, like a 60-inch television, high definition.  And I got my brother like a t-shirt or something.  Like I'm really inconsistent.  It keeps them on their toes, though.  Well, you know, it keeps them mad.  It keeps them really mad.  You shouldn't expect a good gift from them either.  Remember, they have to give you a gift, too. 
[02:02:00]  What did you buy for yourself?  Anything cool?  A couple.  No.  Nothing good for you?  A couple strippers.  A couple strippers?  No.  Yeah, sometimes, though.  Ugh.  But not real expensive ones.  Where do you live?  Pittsburgh.  Pittsburgh.  Oh, I'm going to be there in a few weeks.  All right.  At the improv.  Oh, don't.  Oh, get out.  Yeah, right before Super Bowl Sunday.  I'll be there next week, actually.  Oh, Super Bowl.  Are you going?  Are you a Steelers fan?  No.  Oh, you have to be, or you're killed at birth.  It's true.  It's kind of like, I lived in Buffalo. 
[02:02:30]  The same thing with the Bills up there in Buffalo.  Yeah.  You have to root for the whole team.  The city's all bummed out.  Everyone's all depressed.  Yeah.  It was before the game that they lost.  You guys choked, is what you did.  I didn't choke.  Well, I know.  They did.  They choked.  Yeah, but she's a winner.  See, Ben is a Pats fan.  I hate you.  And he feels like he has something to do with them winning.  But we all hate him, anyway.  Him and his red socks and Patriots.  Now, it's the best year ever.  It's the best year ever.  It's my year.  Yeah, go Pats.  Go Sox.  Shut up. 
[02:03:00]  You've got to be loyal to a team, though.  Like, when I was a kid, I would always root for the same team.  My father would always go, you've got to like them when they're down as well as when  they're up.  Yeah, you have to.  And he'd go, yeah, man, you've got to.  You can't be a fair weather fan.  No.  They'll kill you for that.  Or they will in Pittsburgh, at least.  I don't even go to my own Steeler games because I'm afraid of the fans because they're so mean.  They're animals.  They're insane.  Animals.  I'm actually glad they lost because now I don't have to compete with all those pre-Super Bowl parties.  Yeah, you'll never beat us.  There was like, you know, big banners going into the city like, Steelers rule, Patriots suck. 
[02:03:30]  I'm like, well, welcome to the city.  Yeah.  You didn't buy anything good like a car?  I bought my dad one of those H2s.  Oh, cool.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Very cool.  But they gave me a car when I won Survivor, so I don't need to know.  They gave you one?  Yeah.  That crappy car.  It's a Saturn, and it's cute.  I drive a Saturn.  Saturn.  Exactly.  That crappy car.  What kind do you have?  That damn hippie car.  Whatever one they gave me for free model.  Very safe car.  Good on gas.  It is a very safe car, but I have a Jeep too.  Are you driving the Saturn?  I am driving the Saturn.  Are you really?  Okay.  It's like a little go-kart.  It's a hippie car. 
[02:04:00]  Is it a hippie car?  I thought that was a bug.  No, there's this whole cult with Saturn.  Like the people only buy Saturns and stuff.  They're good cars.  They're very reliable.  Amen.  Good.  There you go.  But I have a Jeep too, because I can't drive the Saturn in the winter in Pittsburgh.  I'll never go anymore.  Say a Jeep.  I have a Jeep.  But my dad has the H2, and it snows like 20 inches.  He's like, I'm taking the car out.  I'm like, you're an idiot.  And it's like cruising around in people's yards and stuff with the car, running over bushes.  That's a great car to get a dad.  Oh, he loves it.  He didn't pick me up at the airport one time because he was getting it washed. 
[02:04:30]  He was like, I can't take the car out.  I just got it washed.  I'm like, you've got to be kidding me.  It's like, but I bought you that car.  Now pick me up.  It's his now.  He loves that car.  And he got all this crazy stuff on it, like a camera inside and stuff like that.  Really?  Yeah.  And he has chrome everywhere.  I'm like, Dad, what's going on?  You're like, pimp my ride.  And you're my dad.  It's kind of weird.  But it's a huge car.  I won't even drive it because it's like driving a tank.  Those things are giant.  You can't drive that in New York City.  You should see trying to get in it is a task. 
[02:05:00]  I'm like, Jesus Christ.  Hang on to one thing and hang on to the other and then lift your one leg up.  What a good daughter.  I know.  I'm so good.  That's kind of making up for the naked pictures, though, I think.  Yeah.  Dads really don't like that.  Sorry about the naked picture.  He has a car.  How did he feel about that?  I never really asked him because it's kind of creepy.  It is kind of creepy.  Do you think in your mind?  He did not look at the picture.  Do you think he looked?  No, I think he's...  I mean, obviously, he saw the cover, but...  And then the pictures, some of the pictures they showed on the TV when I did press were  like had the little Playboy ribbon. 
[02:05:30]  Right.  And that makes me a little uncomfortable.  He saw the ribbon pictures.  He saw the ribbon pictures?  Yeah.  But that doesn't show much more than a bathing suit.  And I'm sure he's in a bathing suit.  No, no.  The ribbon pictures are fine, but I don't think he...  I'm just hoping not because it'll give me nightmares.  Oh, my God.  That's rough.  And what about his friends, though?  Aren't there people?  Yeah, that's the thing.  Hey, dude.  Dad's friends are like, you know, people you see.  Friends, uncles, please.  They've all seen us.  Well, they all come up to me and like when I'm with my dad, they're like, can you sign  this picture?  And it's like naked.  And I'm like, there's like boobs.  I'm like, oh, can you get the hell out of here? 
[02:06:00]  You freak.  He definitely saw you.  He definitely saw the naked pictures.  He took some private moments somewhere.  Oh, without a doubt.  Definitely.  Opened it up.  I don't like when fans come up.  Probably took a lot of thought and sat there for a while.  And you know, okay, I gotta say it.  I'll just look at one.  I'll just look at one.  Not in a creepy way, but just like, and I bet you at one point.  Just curiosity.  At one point, it was like this.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy.  Just for one second, it went from hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Oh.  I wish we could.  Like he accidentally flipped through. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, I didn't know it was this magazine she was in.  Oh, I already went through it.  I wish we could call your dad, because that would be hilarious.  I don't like when fans come up and they're like, I saw your spread in Playboy, and they  have this, I'm like, uh, and you don't have anything, they don't have anything else  to tell you.  Yeah.  I saw your layout in Playboy.  I'm like, okay, cool.  That's them thinking you're going to go, oh, you did?  You want to see me naked live?  Yeah.  We'll go to bed.  That's what people think.  Just because you got naked in the magazine, they're like, think you do it all the time.  Like I go grocery shopping, and I just like hang around and take off my top in the frozen  food section.  Nice. 
[02:07:00]  It's not like, that's not how it works.  No.  It's not, they're like, would you ever do it again?  I'm like, no, why?  I got a camera.  Why?  Yeah.  Would you do Hustler or no?  Did they offer you enough money?  No way.  Because that scene is different than Playboy.  No, because you've got to show pink.  Yeah.  Wild sand.  Yeah, that's fine.  You certainly can.  That's gross.  There was not even any crotch shots of me in that one.  That's why I hate Playboy.  Heidi accidentally, we proved some pictures, and she missed a little bit of bush in one.  Really?  It finally came out.  She's like, there's like a big leaf missing where her crotch is.  How did you hide it? 
[02:07:30]  Were you turning sideways?  There was like turn and plants and stuff.  But bush is okay, but pink isn't, huh?  Pink is not okay.  That's how some of the girls think?  Because pink isn't even attractive.  Yes, it is.  No, it's not.  Are you kidding?  I love those split shots where they're just naked doing the thumbs up, legs wide open.  I have never seen a split shot of someone going, totally cool.  I've never seen a thumbs up one.  I don't know what he's reading.  I think headstand with the legs open should be the shots.  I love it.  Pink is not hot.  Pink is like looking at balls.  Balls are not hot.  They are.  Pink is hot.  Balls are hot?  Yeah.  Pink is definitely hot.  Pink is not hot. 
[02:08:00]  If you don't want to show it in a magazine, that's cool, but yeah, pink's hot.  It all depends.  Hey, how come she's tapping you saying we got to go?  What's the matter?  No, they do have to go.  They had to leave like five minutes ago.  I always said if it's nice and like everything's contained, then it's fine.  There's some-  If it looks like someone sneezed with a mouthful of hubba bubba, you know, then no.  We don't want to see it.  Oh, gross.  Hubba bubba.  We enjoyed this interview.  I'm sorry you have to go.  I know.  I really enjoyed having you on.  That's Jenna.  These are my girls back here that started the business with me.  Oh.  Model challenge. 
[02:08:30]  To my girls.  Where do you guys have to go after here?  What?  I don't know.  Jen's my assistant for the day.  Where do you got to go next?  PLJ.  PLJ, everybody.  PLJ.  Hey, you're not going to Hot 97, are you?  No.  Go on their morning show and do Tsunami songs?  PLJ.  Who's the DJs at PLJ?  They stink.  Scott and Todd.  And I bet you they don't like pink.  Be ready for a lot of this.  So what have you been doing since you got here?  They stink.  And I bet you they don't like pink either.  Yeah, you want no conversations about pink unless it's Todd's shirt. 
[02:09:00]  Jenna, while you're there, check out Scott's facelift.  Oh, shut up.  Yeah.  Did he have a facelift?  Now you're not even going to be able to concentrate on the interview.  I am not.  I hate you guys.  Yeah.  Just check out how tight his face is.  If he wants to lick his lips, he has to put a finger in his ass and his tongue pops out.  All right.  We got to get her out of here.  All right.  The big plug, Jenna.  What is it again?  It's modelchallengeusa.com.  All right.  Modelchallengeusa.com.  Can we just call you from time to time?  You can call me anytime.  Are you kidding me?  And you're cool.  Come in.  We'll talk about pink. 
[02:09:30]  Can we get your dad on the phone?  You could.  Because we know he saw your naked pictures and we want to see what that was in.  He would probably laugh the whole entire time.  At some point, we would love to talk to your dad about that whole time.  You can call him.  You can call me and call him.  I'd love to come back on.  Let's do that.  That would be very funny because we know he saw your pictures and we want to walk through  the whole thing.  Did he have to prepare?  Did he do a bunch of shots?  He might have done some shots.  Yeah.  You'd have to.  You'd have to.  You'd have to.  Okay.  Call me.  I'll give you a couple of quick pictures real quick before you go.  Jimmy's got to take pictures.  Thank you, Jenna.  Thanks.  There she goes. 
[02:10:00]  Jenna, one survivor.  She got heels on.  How tall are you?  Five.  Seven and a half.  Five, seven and a half?  Five, eight.  Jenna Maraska.  Very cool.  All right.  Yeah, that's our little.  It's pretty pathetic right now, but that's our photo gallery that we have.  We're going to add you, though.  That's nice.  We're going to add you.  We're going to add this one.  You can.  Yeah, we'll add that to our.  That's what we call our douche commercial.  Yeah.  All right.  That picture of the two girls with their heads together.  That does look.  And the butterflies in the hair. 
[02:10:30]  Nice.  Very douche-ish.  All right.  There's Jenna Anthony.  We should play something as we go to break here so we can regroup.  I don't know what to play, though, man.  What do you got?  You got nothing ready to go?  Bye, Jenna.  Take it easy.  No, I don't want to play that, Eric.  All right.  I need something else.  I got something.  What?  Is that a Tsunami song?  Oh, Drew Boogie.  She was really cool, man.  Wait, is this all your new remixes?  Yes, it is.  Number two.  Wow.  We'll play it live so we can give you the big plug and talk to Drew Boogie.  Okay.  You know, that'll waste some time.  Yeah, we'll do that. 
[02:11:00]  Norm MacDonald talking about the game.  We found this clip yesterday.  Finally, it's an old clip that we still have a lot of fun with.  And couldn't be happier that we got this back on the new show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It'll be in bad taste as you look back on it.  Maybe at the time you thought it was a good play, but you look back on it and you think  that was in bad taste.  Well, sometimes, like in stand-up, I'll do jokes that are, like one time I was doing this  thing in San Francisco and they were all gay people in the audience, they told me.  So I figured I'll do it.  In San Francisco?  Yeah.  So I figured I'd do stuff about gay people so that they could relate to it. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, it's warm up.  They love that.  And so I was talking about, because I went to this gay pride parade and I saw in it there  were these old men and old ladies with these signs that said, we are proud of our gay son.  You know?  And so I was saying, that's an odd thing to be proud of, you know, because it's not an  achievement.  You know, it's not like something you work all your life to be gay or anything like that.  And I just wondered, I just, I had a hard time believing that these 50, 60-year-old men 
[02:12:00]  are actually bragging, you know, at work, like they're, hey, Bill, you know, my kid, oh  my God, we're proud of him, Johnny.  He graduated from Harvard, you know, first in his class, you know what I mean?  And now he's articling over at a law firm and, oh yeah, he loves c**k.  You know?  This kid.  He can't get enough c**k in his mouth, his ass, this kid's always c**k. 
[02:12:30]  I got a, I got a picture of the boy here sucking another man's c**k.  I want to show it to him.  Life in corporate America can be a grind.  All they do is they remove the humor from everything.  And you don't want to worry about your behavior around the office becoming a problem.  I'm standing here with this erection feeling silly.  You're going to need some sound advice.  Talk less and suck more.  From a qualified professional.  I'm a stand-up comic who hates his own guts.  New from the Hiv Corporation. 
[02:13:00]  It's the Jim Norton Sensitivity Handbook.  Sensitivity training.  Maybe you can send someone from Human Resources in and they can tickle my bag a little.  I can go, ooh, very sensitive area.  And then they can leave.  Jim will help you construct a business plan.  Greed is good.  He'll guide you through the hiring process.  Hire all fat chicks if you don't want them harassed.  He's also a whiz at customer relations.  Here's what you do, stupid.  When they complain, you go, click.  You take the phone.  Click.  Ladies will also enjoy Jim's wardrobe recommendations. 
[02:13:30]  You send them to training to not have those big tits showing during the workday.  Jim is also an experienced marriage counselor.  How could you marry a chick that won't drink out of your mule?  And he can help mend even the most fractured of family relationships.  I killed my wife with a hammer.  And he'll also assist with time management.  130, Human Resources attempts to talk about sensitivity training.  135, they are wiping saliva that Jim Norton has spit on them off of themselves as he walks outdoor. 
[02:14:00]  Ha ha!  End of meeting.  Call 1-800-LOG-DROP for the Jim Norton Sensitivity Handbook.  Order today.  Meeting adjourned.  That's his first show.  Big Ten Basketball.  It's the Big Ten Today on XM Satellite Radio.  It's Wednesday, January 26, 2005.  I'm Maggie Linton with the Big Ten Today.  Big Ten Women's D-Ball.  Ohio State continues to be one of the women's teams to beat this season.  The Lady Buckeyes remain third on AP and fourth on the Coach's Poll. 
[02:14:30]  They beat Indiana and Northwestern to easily hang on to their ranking.  OSU plays the Lady Badgers in Wisconsin tomorrow night.  Minnesota climbed two spots to tenth on the AP.  The Lady Gophers, with a record of 16-3, 6-1 in conference, put together back-to-back wins against Michigan and Illinois.  They play league-leading Penn State on Sunday.  The Lady Lions are seven and zipped in the Big Ten and have a record of 12-6. 
[02:15:00]  Big Ten!  Michigan State, following a loss to Penn State, dropped to 11th.  The Lady Spartans are tied with Minnesota with an overall record of 16-3, but sit in fourth in the Big Ten with a record of 5-2.  MSU plays Purdue tonight.  The Lady Boilermakers, for the first time since March 1998, that's right, 1998, dropped from the polls,  ending a string of 123 consecutive appearances.  Purdue ended a three-game losing streak on Sunday with a win over Iowa. 
[02:15:30]  Basketball is my favorite sport.  I like the way to dribble up and down the court.  Moving to the men's side, Penn State's Aaron Johnson currently leads the nation with three 20-plus rebound games.  He grabbed 21 in the 65-62 squeaker over Northwestern on Saturday.  The 6'9 junior became the first Nittany Lion to boast three 20-plus games in a season since Jesse Arnell in 1955.  And that's the Big Ten today on XM Satellite Radio.

Steve is such a zero. 
[02:18:30]  Martini Steve.  We're doing this tsunami thing, the tsunami song.  Talking about Hot 97, blah, blah, blah.  A lot of national news programs are talking about it.  And we're all hanging during the break, and Martini Steve's in here, and he sees Lionel Richie up on the screen on the Today Show.  Because the real song, We Are the World, is celebrating its 20th anniversary, I believe.  20th anniversary?  I think that was 1985, right?  I think they are going to re-release it and give some of the proceeds to the tsunami victims.  All right, so they're doing a little thing on that. 
[02:19:00]  And Lionel Richie is on with Katie Couric, I guess.  And who's the other guy, Matt?  Matt Lauer.  Matt Lauer.  And all of a sudden, Martini Steve goes into panic mode and goes,  Oh my God, I've got to run tape.  I think Lionel Richie's going to comment about the tsunami song.  I'm like, you zero.  Yeah, sure he is.  Way to be up on pop culture.  It's not that big, Steve.  It's just a story.  We're supposed to be a hip radio show.  You should be up on pop culture.  Oh my God, it's Lionel Richie.  He's going to comment.  He's going to comment.  Who was the guy doing the vocals on that?  I want him. 
[02:19:30]  He's a great singer.  Well, did you hear The American Hostage?  He had the rifle pointed at his head, and he said,  Look, please stop playing that song, or Al Zarkawi will lock my head off.  Yeah.  You go running out trying to record it.  Wait a minute.  I think that's it.  Johnny Carson.  Wait, Johnny Carson's up on...  I think he commented on the Hot 97 controversy before he died.  Well, you do realize why I said that.  And I'm not going to defend it.  It was a moronic thing, and I regret it completely.  But that song that Rick wrote, and I'm assuming he wrote it because he's constantly over the top, 
[02:20:00]  was done to the We Are The World.  We Are The World.  And that's why I said it.  Having said that, it was still a moronic thing to say.  Yeah.  So, yeah.  They're going to bring Willie Nelson and Steve Perry on for comments, too?  I wouldn't mind seeing Steve Perry.  Let's hope that Ray doesn't win the Oscar because he was in We Are The World,  and maybe Jamie Foxx will make a tsunami statement while accepting his award.  This is big.  You're right.  It's just one of those things.  You walk in, you see it, and like half a second later, you're like,  crap, I just fueled another... 
[02:20:30]  Oops.  Yeah, oops.  Dude, did you see the flack that Prince Harry got by wearing that Hot 97 badge on his arm  at that concert party?  I know.  Wasn't that awful?  Steve ran out of the studio earlier.  There was a clip of Star Trek on, and when he saw Sulu,  he thought it was an Asian commenting on the tsunami song.  Oh, my God.  He looks angry.  He's firing phasers or something.  You really are the worst, man.  I stink.  It was the dumbest thing I possibly could have said,  and I'm so insulated in that other room. 
[02:21:00]  He is a go-getter, though.  He was all excited.  He waddled out of the room.  Oh, he almost broke a leg when Hawaii Five-O came on.  He was sure it was a press conference.  The Asian media.  I'm so insulated in that other room, and I pop my head out every once in a while,  and I see Eric running 100 miles an hour to dive into a tape player to tape something.  I'm like, all right, I better stay alert.  There's probably something going on, and the one time I catch something,  it's completely the wrong thing.  You said Lionel Richie's in the comment.  People wouldn't ask his opinion if Nicole Richie wrote that song. 
[02:21:30]  No one cares what he thinks.  You know what?  The logic being, he wrote the original song with Michael Jackson.  He's too busy dancing on the ceiling.  He can't be bothered, Steve.  What, are you hibernating, Steve, or something?  Say you, say tsunami, floating on the ceiling.  I can't think of any more Lionel Richie songs.  All right, well, Pamunak from...  Hello?  Yeah.  Is the phone at the other end of this underwater?  Is it me or blah, blah, blah? 
[02:22:00]  Uh-oh, hope the old Asian DJ doesn't write a rap about us.  Yo, y'all motherfuckers on satellite.  Yuck.  Is that a tree going through your head?  Is God laughing at you?  Well, Pat from Munaki's here, guys.  Yes, we've been looking at him out the window the whole time.  And he brought Steve a present.  Yeah.  A present.  Do you want to show everybody what Pat from Munaki brought you?  We'll describe it for the radio. 
[02:22:30]  Pat from Munaki.  Now he's a big star on the message board on Wackbag.  He's a big star.  He's got his own thread going and everything.  Pat from Munaki.  We couldn't even get him in the other day.  We had to, like, get him a couple days in advance, book him.  Oh, I know.  He had to be booked.  Availability.  We've got to check his availability.  There it is, Steve.  Well, should we bring Pat from Munaki in here?  Bring Pat in.  All right, Steve, go to that mic then.  Yeah.  Here, lift that mic up. 
[02:23:00]  All right.  Over there.  Over there.  Oh, well.  Here's Pat from Munaki.  How you doing, Pat?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Oh, good, good.  Get closer to the mic.  There it is.  All righty.  All right.  Get closer to the mic.  Feel a little gay right now.  These guys love you for some reason.  I don't get it.  I got to be honest.  I don't get the whole Pat from Munaki.  How can you not get it?  But a lot of people, they say it's their new favorite thing on the Opie and Anthony program. 
[02:23:30]  So, Pat?  Yes?  You were the winner of the eggnog drinking contest.  Of course, here's the winning audio when you finally had a puke.  I don't think you can hear it.  Well, I'm not playing for him, right?  And since that famous appearance, these guys have been obsessed with you. 
[02:24:00]  That's his little...  I love his little comments.  His little jokes.  They're just the best.  Comes up and just right off the cuff will come out with a funny little line.  Is this one of your comments?  Talking about the morning show?  Yes.  You said this outside?  Yes, I did.  And what is it?  I chinked there in trouble.  I chinked there in trouble.  That's outrageous. 
[02:24:30]  Ovaltine.  Shouldn't it be called round-teen?  The glass is round.  Well, what are you going to do?  The big smile comes on the little smirk like that.  I tried.  I gave it a go.  My dogs are barking.  Got to be in it to win it.  Now I know what that means.  Nine of them.  It's a car crash.  Yes, it's a car crash.  Now, Pat, you've been on Wackbag and posting things. 
[02:25:00]  And one thing you posted was a picture that is disgusting.  What is it?  He posted a picture of his foot right before and after they lopped his toe off because of diabetes.  Really?  Yes.  Yes.  One of his toes.  Now, sort of like that.  He's doing the old pull your finger off your hand gag, which is a sight gag. 
[02:25:30]  But the glass, anyway, is awful.  So, yeah, you lost a toe.  Yeah, I'm hoping to find it somewhere.  Oh, my God.  He's awful.  That's not bad.  Let's see.  I tried.  One of the...  Are you reading one of his posts?  Not really.  It's about what he eats.  Like, they've whittled you down on the message board now where you have to explain to people what you eat.  Because they were yelling at you for drinking so much eggnog. 
[02:26:00]  You deserve to have your arms and legs cut off.  Yeah, some people are saying you deserve to just be a head.  Can he read his post?  Maybe Pat can read his own post if you have a post because this way people can hear him read what he wrote.  All right.  Yeah.  What did the guy write to you, Pat, first?  He wrote,  Holy shit, I'm a diabetic.  You just scared the fuck out of me.  You're a fucking idiot.  I don't even drink because I don't want to lose a toe.  And you do 70 shots of eggnog?  A lot of diabetics, well, I'll just say,  we're very angry with you for coming in here and doing so much eggnog, 
[02:26:30]  which has a lot of sugar in it,  and thinking that you were stupid for doing that.  My point was I threw most of it up.  Right.  What was your email response?  My email response.  Wait, wait, continue, though.  Oh, I think it was done.  Easy there, Sparky.  First of all, I puked.  No, no, no, continue with the...  Oh, okay.  You could have gone into a diabetic coma during the show.  Did you even take insulin before the contest?  What a moron.  You deserve to lose a toe.  Mm-ha, mm.  See my toe?  Mm-ha.  Now you don't.  He wrote that? 
[02:27:00]  Yes, he did.  What'd you respond?  He actually wrote that.  I responded, easy there, Sparky.  First of all, I puked almost all of it up.  See video.  Uh, secondly, since my toe was chopped off, my daily diet consists of 12 ounces of tea,  everything sweetened with Splenda, of course, four eggs for breakfast, two chicken breast  halves, and five cups of spinach, uh, for dinner.  Thirdly, about once a week, I go to a movie and have a large popcorn with butter and a Diet Coke. 
[02:27:30]  And, uh, uh...  Fourthly.  Fourthly, I go out maybe 10 times a year, mostly O&A-related stuff, Belmar, Hammerstein,  the Downtown, Cherry Darts, Brian Regan, Eggnock Contest, etc.  Uh, fifthly, those few times I go out, I'll do whatever the fuck I want.  Uh, you're right, I did deserve to lose my toe.  My sugar was 465 when I went in the hospital, and it was high for a long time.  Uh, currently, my sugar's between 100 and 200.  Not bad, since I have no health insurance. 
[02:28:00]  Complications occur when it's out of control for a long time.  That's the type 2 version, that is.  And if I lose anything else, I'll deserve that.  Sixthly, hey, I want a MiFi.  Whee!  Whee.  Isn't that what one of the little piggies said?  Whee, whee, all the way.  Which one got cut off?  Whee, whee, whee, all the way to the dumpster.  Uh, my fourth...  Yeah, that's what I call the ring toe.  The ring toe?  Uh, the fourth one on the...  Oh, man, can I see that?  That was the little piggies that stayed home. 
[02:28:30]  All right, let's see the toe.  How long ago did you have this hacked off?  Uh, it was...  First, I noticed a little redness in the toe.  Okay, yeah, give me the build-up.  I learned not to trim your toenails with a butter knife after that.  Which is true.  What do you mean?  Why a butter knife?  I didn't have a nail clipper.  Butter?  I don't even know her.  Ha, ha, ha.  Man, man.  What are you going to do?  I'm trying to balance myself.  Oh, he's going to fall.  That's rough.  Whoa. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, my God.  Let me see.  Oh, wow.  Look like Fred Flintstone over here.  Holy...  Wow.  Let's see.  I don't know.  I don't even know what to say.  Where's that picture up on whackbag.com?  Oh, dude.  It is so heinous.  It's right after the...  It's in the hospital room.  It's right after the operation, and it looks like someone took a hatchet.  They didn't suture it up.  They didn't suture it up, and it closes naturally.  It looked like a hatchet wound.  You know how...  Like they took an axe and put it between his toes.  It's more a wow, and I'll tell you why. 
[02:29:30]  I'm not grossed out, because they did a...  I don't know.  No, it healed great.  It just looks like...  It looks...  Yeah.  I mean, he has four toes to count.  Yeah, but it looks very natural in a weird way.  One, two, three, four.  No, I understand, but I thought there'd be a huge...  I thought there'd be a huge space in between the toes or something.  It's...  Yeah, there was that right after, but it sort of...  Yeah, it's like a cartoon character.  That's pretty wild.  Is your balance off?  No, I was worried that it might be, because I'm holding up a lot of weight here, and...  Yeah, no, it's fine.  It's fine? 
[02:30:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Well, you brought Martini Steve a little present.  Yes, he did.  I want to describe your present, Steve, for everybody.  I saw those in Big and Tall Casual Mail.  Uh-huh.  Big and Tall Casual Mail.  Is that where you shop?  Yeah.  Yeah, these are Big Dog's boxer shorts with flames and hot rod in flame writing on the back.  Oh, hot rod.  Yeah.  Right on your ass.  Yeah, exactly.  Like, insert here.  And, uh...  Hot rod and a warm bear. 
[02:30:30]  Oh.  Oh.  I can't.  I'm going to wear the button now.  You're done.  And, you know, I...  Thank you, Pat.  I had no idea they made things like this.  You know, I have this aficionado for...  Aficionado.  I suck today.  Are you all right?  Affinity?  Wrong company.  Oh, wait.  Lionel Rich is going to talk about these on...  Affinity.  Working for XM now.  I have this affinity for flame clothing, and I'm not even aware that half this stuff exists,  so I appreciate it.  Thank you very much, Pat.  So you're going to wear those? 
[02:31:00]  Not right now, but yes, I will.  You're going to wear them around the house, maybe?  Yeah, around the house.  This is like sleeping in boxers, because the material's very thick.  I can imagine you sweat a lot in these.  Why do you sleep in boxers?  As opposed to...  Naked.  Mude.  Nicely taken.  What is he going...  No, it's not...  No, thanks.  Is it true you brought other things?  Oh, pastries.  Oh, pastries.  Pastries.  You've been eating any of those?  Steve requested.  It was actually...  He said half in jest, and he actually showed up with them, so that was very cool. 
[02:31:30]  You aren't eating those?  No.  I usually...  Last time I had them put the string over the box to keep me from getting to them.  All right.  Tied it up.  Yeah.  Yeah, because you'd dig right in.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, because they're even shaped like little toes.  You don't eat one of those.  Little cannoli.  Mm-mm-mm-mm.  All right.  All right.  I'm sort of starting to get it.  You're warming up to him.  I'm getting it.  All right.  I'm lovable.  He's lovable. 
[02:32:00]  Any other things you want to get off your chest there?  Yeah.  Hmm.  Anything in the news?  Anything in the news?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  No.  I guess I'll have to watch the news now.  He's got nothing.  He's got nothing.  What is this now?  This is Philbin Transport.  Oh, that's me.  I figured I could go to Washington, D.C. for your sound machine won't end up on the other  side of the country.  Take it door-to-door, direct.  What do you transport now? 
[02:32:30]  You don't transport people?  Anything.  Anything that will fit in a van.  Oh, okay.  Products.  Yeah.  That's your job?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  So if something has to go from point A to point B, you're the man to call.  Yes.  Instead of like FedEx or UPS.  Yeah.  FedEx, they could track it so you'll know it's in New Orleans.  Yeah.  In the wrong place.  Right.  They're annoying, though, with their planes and stuff like that.  I'd rather have just you in a van.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  95.  Yeah.  Just drive it there.  What the hell?  Yeah.  As long as I don't tell a joke, I won't crash.  And you, uh, there's no tracking the package when it's with, so the guy can't look and 
[02:33:00]  say, oh, he's in front of ONA's studio again.  Oh, yeah.  Well, you got my phone number.  You can call me.  I'm on the road.  That's pretty much you get the tracking.  Hello, Pat.  Where are you?  It's here.  All right.  Right here.  Well, Kevin in Brooklyn has something.  Go ahead, Kevin.  Hey, did Pat go to the hospital in ambulance or a tow truck?  A tow truck.  Pat didn't hear him.  Yeah. 
[02:33:30]  Drew, give him the headphones for a little bit.  We'll get to Drew next.  Cigars and Scotch.  What's going on?  Hey.  Oh, he was weird.  That last joke Pat told, it's only totals.  Totals.  Totals.  Cigars and Scotch.  This guy posts on Wackbag, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's actually funny, man.  He posts some really funny stories.  All right.  Cool.  Wackbag.com.  All right, Pat.  I don't know.  You can hang out there for a little bit.  We'll have you back in for the rest of the show.  I told my dogs that I'd bring them home a treat from the hospital, but they wouldn't 
[02:34:00]  let me keep the toe.  Ow.  Oh, neck brace.  Eh, well, what are you going to do?  Ow, neck brace.  Hey, I threw it out there.  Yeah.  Like the eggnog.  It was all done.  In a good natured kind of way.  You know, happy.  I hope this fog lifts.  Can I ask, if you own your own business, why don't you insure yourself so you have health  insurance?  Because it costs a lot of money. 
[02:34:30]  Okay.  Makes perfect sense.  Fair enough.  Yeah, there you go.  I had to buy my fire.  Oh, you're one of mine.  It costs a toe, anyway.  Wow, they're just piling up.  Yeah, they really are.  All right.  There he goes.  Pat from Monaki.  Always a pleasure.  Thank you, Pat.  You could limp your way out and take a seat.  We'll have you back in.  Yeah.  If you have anything that you want to comment on, just kind of raise your hand and we'll  bring you back in.  You have caught blinds today.  You can just raise.  What's up, Ben?  Do you want to put a light bulb in your mouth? 
[02:35:00]  Oh, Pat, Pat.  Yes?  Oh.  Oh.  All right.  Drew Boogie in the studio.  Drew does a lot of the great mixes that you hear on the show.  Oh, yeah.  Been with us for years now.  Did a great job with that Asian rap that they heard on 97 today.  Congratulations.  You sounded real angry.  Fantastic.  Fantastic.  What are you looking for?  I gave him the big introduction.  That's where you say hi.  Oh, hi. 
[02:35:30]  I'm sorry.  And while you're saying hi and just shooting the S here, I was trying to find your Drew  Boogie remix.  It's by your left-handed.  No, I got that one.  I was looking for the old one.  Oh, okay.  We'll find it.  Whatever.  All right.  So you got a couple new remixes that you brought in today.  Yeah.  Decided to try and have some fun with Tourette's.  Oh.  Yeah.  So what's the first track we're going to hear?  Number two.  I did a lot of work with Demented World this time.  Okay.  What I didn't do last time.  Well, what about the first track?  The first track is like a song length.  You don't want to go to that right away. 
[02:36:00]  That's the better one.  So I want to do the other one first.  Oh, you're smart.  Okay.  What, Eric?  Pat had a quick question.  Pat had a quick question.  All right.  Obi, don't you have a cat?  Sort of.  Oh.  That sounds weird.  If you have a cat, why do you have a mouse problem?  Because I, well, I had two places and the cats might be somewhere else now.  Oh.  Never mind.  Thanks for bringing it up.  I bet you feel really stupid now, right? 
[02:36:30]  I felt real stupid before I asked.  Any other pet questions?  You came all the way back in here for that.  Yeah.  All right.  He's out of the studio.  Problem, Kevin?  Kevin.  Pat said to me before, does Obi have a cat?  And I'm like, I know you don't.  I'm like, yeah, he does.  Go ask him.  Is there a problem?  No.  What's wrong?  No, no, no.  What's wrong?  I don't know.  What's wrong, Eric?  Just his foot.  Oh, the foot.  It wasn't that bad.  It wasn't that bad.  I would have loved to give the audience a great reaction. 
[02:37:00]  It wasn't that bad.  Huh.  All right.  Here's a Drew Boogie remix.  Ladies and gentlemen, here they come.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, we'll be in the end today.  Here we go.  Waka, waka.  Give it to me.  We're talking.  What the fuck is that?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:37:30]  I like that.  Oh, yeah.  I can't believe it.  Are you insane?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, goddamn.  All right.  Say what again?  Come on.  Say what?  What?  God the fuck?  Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck up.  Give it to me. 
[02:38:00]  Fuck it.  Oh, wow.  That's awesome, man.  That's nice.  That's sweet.  Make that into a promo immediately.  Very nice.  You should take all the Drew Boogie remixes and then make a bunch of promos out of them,  man.  Definitely.  I gave Steve a bunch of promos.  He's voicing them now.  Oh, really?

[02:38:30]  Ramone, clean this up.  Click, click, click, clean this up.  So what's the, this is the better one you're saying?  Yeah, the second.  Because that one was pretty cool.  Yeah, the second one was like a prodigy type of thing.  Okay.  And, but I made it long form.  So, you know, it's like a, it's like a whole song, but.  Hey, man, we're all for long form.  You know.  Right.  Smack my bitch up type of thing.  But, you know, with you guys.  All right.  Less stuff we have to come up with.  So we'll go long form.  Here's Drew Boogie.  You are.

[02:43:00]  Definitely, and you just gave Steve a whole bunch of other ones?  Promos  Promos stuff  You gotta put this guy on the payroll  Drew is the best  This shit rocks  Was that Scott Farrell in the second song?  Yeah, it was  I could hear his  What do you go to school for?  Economics  He's getting a degree  Very, very, very cool  Alright  Yeah, it's a whole lot of fun  I wanna hear the promos now  Well, Steve's gotta voice him so 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, okay  My voice is not exactly radio worthy so  Well, we'll debut him tomorrow on the show  How's that?  Exactly  Remote  Plus I asked Mars to hook up a little something here  So that I can plug my mixer  And so I can actually bring the turntable stuff in  So I can do it live on here  Man, that would be cool  That would be cool  So he's gonna hook me up with that  I don't know how you guys do that  One day you'll just have to set up and be our, like, in-studio, yeah, mix DJ  That'd be fun  That'd be a lot of fun to check out  How about a Pat from the Bunaki mix? 
[02:44:00]  Crash  Crash  Crash  You know what I wanna do is  What I wanna do is  I have a couple things of Patty  And I was gonna do a little George Bush type remix on her  Oh, that's a good idea  Wow  You remember when she said she wanted to see the guys doing the, lifting the weights with their penises?  Right 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, yeah  Yeah, so, do something like that  That'd be cool  Completely screw her up  That would be nice  Alright, right on  You come back on the air, Patty, I'm gonna fuck with ya  Alright, well, we got some Michael Jackson audio that Jim brought in, too  Oh, I brought a lot of audio today  I was busy last night  We were supposed to get to this about an hour and a half ago  That's fine  This is, uh, I was watching Court TV last night  And, uh, they're talking about, obviously, Michael and some of the porn  Now, I haven't heard how we cut this  Because I just brought in the CDs today, the DVDs  The audio of them talking about the pornography they found 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, apparently they found some damaging stuff  Yeah  Boy magazines  Boy, what was it?  What was it?  The boy  The boy, or boys, the journey  And it was like, uh, uh, a picture photo essay of young boys  They actually talk about that  She actually describes what the book  It's an old book  Apparently a very old book  Alright, let's go to the first clip here  All the classics  We can now report that the Sheriff's Department in Santa Barbara, their investigators, came across an extensive stash of pornography in Michael Jackson's home, in his bedroom, in his master bathroom, in closets, and in his den 
[02:45:30]  Isn't she describing every male's house?  Yes  At this point?  Yes  Stashed everywhere  Yes  I got porn in the bathroom, in the closet  She's describing every single guy's house  Porn  Where do I have porn?  Hmm  Well the difference is, you don't have children staying over all the time with a buzzer outside your bedroom  Speak for yourself 
[02:46:00]  Oh no no, I have the children, just no buzzer  Because I live alone  A buzzer outside the bedroom  Yeah  And we can confirm that at least one of the confiscated porno magazines that was found had on it fingerprints of Michael Jackson, the boy who accused him, and that boy's younger brother  Now we've learned that one of the most shocking reading material that was seized back in 1993 was this book  It's called The Boy, a photographic essay  Some of the pictures inside this book are so suggestive we cannot show them on television 
[02:46:30]  You will be molested  We've confiscated this book from Michael Jackson's bedroom  Oh, you like that, don't you faggot?  What are the pictures like in this book?  They're just a lot of pictures  They're suggestive, in what way?  They're naked boys  They're naked boys  Oh yeah  Swimming and posing with their buttocks showing  Oh!  And she lists some of the magazines they found in Michael's home  Really? Bad?  Some bad, but again, in the context of what was going on, you know what he's doing 
[02:47:00]  Now, is this supposed to be, quote, an art book or is it  I think she actually addresses that  Is it child pornography?  Because that's kind of how Pee Wee got out of the problems he was in  He said he was a collector, and he was collecting  Because he had the same kind of stuff  He had boys, nude books, full of this  And photographs  And he said it was a kitsch kind of art collection that he had  And it wasn't meant to stimulate or anything  Well, she addressed that 
[02:47:30]  I don't know if they have the clip  You might want to hit the second clip  They might have this psychologist talking about that  They do address that  Some might call this coffee table sized book an art book  With the captivating figure of a young prepubescent boy on the cover  The very first photograph inside, a stunning study of the young male physique  Oh dear!  But to this former pedophilia sex crimes detective  And to this mental health professional who has treated sex criminals and victims  This book was published with a specific audience in mind  This is Gadd for people who I would say would be sexually attracted to adolescent boys 
[02:48:00]  Oh, man  This is Gadd twads  Really?  That's bad news, man  Hello, exactly! 
[02:48:30]  And then the final clip is a list of pornos that they found at MJ's house  I just love the fact that she listed it  And again, a lot of it's legitimate  But I'm sorry, when you have children staying at your house  Yeah, yeah  Come on  Not appropriate  This book, Confiscated at Neverland in 1993  Was found among a collection of pornography  By 2003, investigators found another extensive collection of porn at Neverland  Just as Jackson's young accuser claimed 
[02:49:00]  An example of some of the confiscated material  Taken from the master bedroom  Five porno movies with titles like Barely Legal  And Pimp Up, Hose Down  A book of photos of young boys  Seven porno magazines taken from a nightstand  Two books of photos of nude women and boys  Pornographic magazines and a box at the base of the bed  From the master bathroom  Three books of nudes in a plastic bag  A couples magazine  A club magazine  A book of nude photos of men 
[02:49:30]  Two porno magazines and two porno movies in a leather bag  And from the den and a second floor closet  A book of nudes called Naked as a Jaybird  Several books and magazines of nude photos  And several porno magazines in a black briefcase  I love that she had to say Naked as a Jaybird  On national TV  I wanted her to read off more porn movie titles  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah  Where the guy's just reading off the list of movies he's ordering  And Happy Scrappy Hero Pup 
[02:50:00]  Oh, what a mess he's in  Oh, he is  What a complete mess  Look, how did America allow this guy to do this  After you knew he was guilty ten years ago  Right  And he's got your children in his bedroom  And he's doing whatever he does  And he's got porno all over  And, you know, anyone out there that defended him  You stood out there with signs  This is the guy you were defending  It doesn't matter  There's still people that bring their kids to Neverland  To hang out  Yeah  They just will not accept the fact that this guy is a predator 
[02:50:30]  He's a pedophile  And he's been doing this for years  Molesting children  If he  The way he says it  Whenever he does comment on this  Is that he loves children  He gives them a place where they can come and be kids  And have fun  And it's very innocent  Then why is his house just peppered  With these porno magazines  And young boys naked  Pictures of young boys naked  In books  There's no way  It's as innocent as he's portraying it  If you're just having kids come over your house 
[02:51:00]  Because you love children  And you want the innocence of their childhood  I was going to say  In the beginning  I wanted to believe that  You know, he had a messed up childhood  And it was a very innocent thing  That he was hanging out with the kids and stuff  But now, you know  He's lost me too, man  In the beginning  I was like having an open mind about it  Like, well, maybe, you know  He just never had a childhood  And this is his way of, you know  Getting some kind of childhood into his life  Because now it doesn't even matter  If that book is an art book  A coffee table book  It's not an appropriate book to have 
[02:51:30]  For that guy  Who's having young boys  Come to his house  Sleep in his bed  Sleep in his bed  And he's got photos  If that was on the coffee table  And that was the only book  You might let it slide  But it's not  No  Everyone knows what he does  He likes young boys  And America has been denying this for years  And you deserve what you get  He's had the money  For this many years  To keep the heat off of him  But now, you know  Time's run out for this guy  Let's go to Janine  Because she knows the book  Something about the book  That Jackson had  Go ahead, Janine  Morning, guys 
[02:52:00]  I heard he was actually writing  A parenting book  And they found a transcript of it  In his house  It was called  Spare the Child Spoil the Rod  I can't hear you guys at all  So I'm going to punch out  Alright, Janine from Munaki  Bye  And real fast  Pete from Jersey  Go ahead, Pete  I just got off the phone  On the front of mine  Who's black  He's like  Yeah, my mom  And all these people saying  All that stuff is planted  I'm like 
[02:52:30]  By who?  Mark Furman?  Jackson and a boy  Or whatever  On one of these  One of these porn things  Yeah  Because the black community  Recognize  Look, he left a long time ago  When he had his  Nordic features fixed  You lost him  This one, you gotta give up  White people  We've had enough pedophiles  That have popped out  You think we didn't like  Roman Polanski  He does fine movies  Fine work  You know, and he had to go  Yeah  I'm sorry  Jerry Lee Lewis  It ruined his career  Yeah, I think the black community  Has to realize  That some people 
[02:53:00]  Are actually guilty  Yeah  Even if they are people of color  Sometimes  They indeed are guilty  And nobody  You know, Michael  He's like Peter Pan  Yeah, really?  Did Peter Pan ever whack off  On an eight-year-old?  He's not like Peter Pan  First of all  He doesn't have a glass eye  Sandy Duncan  Oh, okay  Well, you didn't have to explain  Yes, I did  Yeah, he did  Because I kind of looked like  Anthony put his finger up  And actually went  You know what?  But you didn't even give him a chance  I saw him  He would have got it 
[02:53:30]  There were so many  So many people since  Sandy Duncan  Have played Peter Pan  That, you know  Takes a while to go back  Yeah, I can throw that out  All right  Because Anthony was in a car crash  Not that you couldn't have anyway  Because it wasn't an awful joke  I wouldn't have  But no, not bad  I was just thinking  Robin Williams was also Peter Pan  Harry Pan  Let's get a black guy's opinion  It's free from New Jersey  What do you call a black guy  That has an opinion, Anthony?  That's not very nice  Free from New Jersey  I was going to tell you  You interrupted me, you idiot  Free 
[02:54:00]  Hey, what's going on?  Hi, Free  Hello  Yeah, hello  I'm right here  What's going on?  I can barely hear you guys  I'm in a truck  All right, listen  We got to fix the phone system  Obviously there's a problem  Okay, Free  What do you have to say?  What's up?  Hey  Yeah, I was  I mean  I was just trying to  You know  Talk about  Like the whole  Michael Jackson thing  You know  Not that it's a very important issue  Because it's really not  The motherfuckers have to look out for me anyway  Yeah  But this whole shit about his 
[02:54:30]  I mean  You know  His love for children  And is he a pedophile  And all of that shit  It's basically  Politics  Money  And bullshit  You know what I mean  He has a white baby mother  Or a so-called whatever  However she got  Maybe immaculate conception  Or whatever the fuck happened  And she doesn't see him  Not fit to raise children  So you gotta  I mean  Everybody has to look at that  You know what I'm saying  And just  Leave the motherfucker alone  You know what I mean?  No, no  Free 
[02:55:00]  Whoa  Do you know  That they actually had an agreement  That she would carry the baby  And he would keep it  That was decided  For financial reasons  Before she had the baby  This wasn't a real relationship  That kind of separated  Okay  It wasn't a real relationship  I agree with that  But at the same time  I don't think  That that woman  Would let  Somebody  Abuse  I mean  Something that she  She helped to create  Are you kidding me?  She doesn't seem like that  People kill  Free 
[02:55:30]  People kill their own children  What are you talking about?  Andrea Yates drowned  Five of her own kids  People do things  Okay  People do do awful things  I understand  I understand  Where you're coming from  With that point  And that's a very valid point  But I think that  If he was doing  That type of stuff  I think that  That white woman  Would probably be out there  Trying to get  Joe right now  For that thing  First of all  She's probably  Already been paid  She has nothing to do  With the family  Or the kids  And all these allegations 
[02:56:00]  And if she's  Letting that go down  Like that  Then you gotta  Blame her  I don't blame her  Because again  I would do the same thing  I hate kids  If Michael wants to  Stick it in them  Go ahead  Just pay me  She sold her kids  To Michael Jackson  Into some kind of  Sex slavery  What's that  Yeah  She actually  Look  We all know  What he's guilty of  He's just a sick guy  It happens  It's one of these things  It's not that people  Should leave him alone  But when you've got  A $300 million 
[02:56:30]  America doesn't want  To admit  White America  Black America  Nobody wants to  Acknowledge  That this guy  Does what he does  Because then it makes  Us feel guilty  For enjoying his music  And it makes us feel  Like idiots  For having loved him  For all these years  That's as a country  Why we deny  That he's doing that  All right  Very good  Pat from Munaki  Yes  We're talking about  The Michael Jackson thing  We figured you might  Have something on that  He did it  Yeah  That's about it  Huh 
[02:57:00]  I did have something  Remember my instant feedback  From the other day  My rap  What was your rap  The thing about  Pauly Shore  Okay  You read it wrong  Oh  That's why it wasn't funny  No it wasn't funny  To begin with  But it wasn't as bad  All right  Well we had Pauly Shore  In I don't know  Was it yesterday  Two days ago  And he was rapping  And he was rapping  Really badly  In three minutes  I made up my own  Little rap  And I said  There was two lines missing  The first one was  My mommy was big 
[02:57:30]  In comedy  And then the second one  Which doesn't go  With it  She owned the comedy store  With all the comics  She was a whore  See that was better than  With all the comics  She was a whore  That's how you read it  No it's not  Did you see the little dance  He was doing  As he was rapping  His arms  Like a little robot  Yeah you were doing  The robot  The comedy  His little body  Little body  His big body  Me and the gecko  From Geico  The one less toe bot 
[02:58:00]  All right Jeff the trucker  Go ahead Jeff  How are you guys doing  All right Jeff  I had a question for you  I'm not a joke  Do you think sometime today  You can play that  Lacey Peterson song  Which one  The one  She smiles  We smile  Remembering Lacey  I wouldn't mind hearing that  That's the one  All right we gotta find that  We haven't played it in a while  Another example  Like the Chinese rapper  Of somebody taking  Trying to make it look like  They're addressing an issue  But really capitalizing on it 
[02:58:30]  For their own artistic game  All right  What's the joke  Michael Jackson joke for you  Why does Michael Jackson  Keep sleeping with  11 year old boys  Why  Because if you slick  Their hair back  They look seven  That's  That's a Jimmy joke  It's sort of a  It's a joke joke  Kenny uses it  But the best  The best version is  What's the best part  About you know  Banging a four year old  In the shower  If you slick her hair back  She looks two  Right  Because that's brutal  On every level  That is the worst  Most tasteless  Offensive joke  And I won't be part  Of the show  That's right 
[02:59:00]  I gotta step aside  I'm stepping aside  But then when you hold her  I'm like misinformation  You hold her  You go  Child slavery  What's that joke  With the punchline  You're scared  I gotta walk out of here alone  Oh my god  That could be the worst  The joke is  The little boy  And this pedophile  Walking through the woods  And the little boy said  I'm scared  And then the pedophile  Apparently goes  You're scared  I gotta walk out of here alone 
[02:59:30]  I gotta go back  To moon hockey alone  Alright listen  Now he's getting annoying again  Get out of here  Alright  Brad from Jersey  Go ahead  Guys what's a ten year old's  Favorite salad dressing  What  Neverland Ranch  Neverland Ranch  Why would that be their favorite  If they're getting abused there  Yeah if they're being abused  I don't get it  Alright Anthony  I found a Bill Hicks bit  We were talking about pornography  Yeah  And when they were talking about 
[03:00:00]  All the stuff they found  At Michael Jackson's house  It reminded me of a pretty good  Bill Hicks bit  You know  His parents going through  His apartment  Oh yeah  After he passes  And what they would find  And tragically  He is dead  I wonder if that actually happened  I know  That's the crazy thing about this  But I think this is the clip  If not  It's Bill Hicks  Talking about pornography  Which is pretty good too  So we'll play this  And we'll continue  That is one of my big fears in life  That I'm going to die  You know  And my parents are going to have to  Come clean out my apartment  I'm going to find that porno wing 
[03:00:30]  I've been adding on to for years  There'll be two funerals that day  You'll see my mom going through my stuff  Look honey  Here's Bill when he was a Cub Scout  Look how cute my baby is  His little short pants  And his little hat  Look how cute my baby was  I wonder what's in this box over here  Rear entry volume 1 through 40  The only guy going through the gates of heaven

Oh yeah, because I deserve to be at the end  after 10 years putting in  Yeah, services  Sure  I'm pretty much just known as a buffer anyway  Like the N  I'm just seen as the N with the two arms out  like an N would be  With the little dashes in between them  Right  I love people  Hey, hey  I love people that take that crap seriously  Like O-P, why is your name first?  Anthony's so much more talented than you  It should be Anthony and O-P  No, I mean it's the crap  I mean we all get trashed on this program  That's one of the things  And it's like, dude, we've never considered  We've always considered, you know 
[03:05:00]  Each other very equal in this program  Right from the get-go  Right  I don't think Anthony and Opie rolls off the tongue  Anthony and Opie  Anthony and Opie  It's that Thee and Opie  I'll tell you what's a cool name for the show though  Yeah  Norton and Friends  Norton and Friends  With the N  Norton and Friends  That's hilarious  Norton and Friends  All right  They're gonna Photoshop that now  Yeah, we have so much  So much stuff to get to  Really fast  We were preparing for the show this morning 
[03:05:30]  And I was reading the editorials  I love reading the editorials  Because it's just a bunch of dopes  The letters to the editor  And now they make it so easy  You don't even have to send off a letter  You just email it in  And they print out  Print up these things  And every day  They're just very entertaining  We should make it a feature on our show  Actually  We really should  Maybe someone could read these things every day  And bring it to our attention  When some idiot out there  Is just spewing stupid crap  Well, you know  Johnny Carson passed away  And everyone  You're kidding 
[03:06:00]  Everyone's doing their tributes  How did it happen?  So people felt like  Where?  People felt like they had to  Write the editor  Yeah  Of this newspaper  I think it might be the Daily News  I'm not even sure  Yeah, this one's the Daily News  Okay  And it's titled  It's Harry B. Jones  Anthony  Had to write a letter to the editor  And the headline is  Laughter in Heaven  Ah, laughter in Heaven  Laughter in Heaven, everyone  Get your tissues out  New Hyde Park, Long Island 
[03:06:30]  As a child of the 60s  I remember watching  The Ed Sullivan Show  As a family  But when I was able to stay up  To watch Johnny Carson  I knew I was being treated  As an adult  St. Peter is saying  Here's Johnny  They felt like they had to print that  In the editorial section today  Here's Johnny  Maybe St. Peter is saying that  But the rest of the country  Reading your letter  Is saying  Ugh  You melodramatic jizzbag 
[03:07:00]  So basically  I guess what this guy is saying  St. Peter is telling all the tsunami victims  Yeah  To wait in line  And they're bringing Johnny  To the front of the line  There's a velvet rope up there too  You know, it takes a while  To process a quarter million people  There's a quarter million people online  Waiting to get into Heaven  But no  Hold on everybody  Here comes Johnny  Ugh  Who do I gotta blow  To get to the front of the line  You hear the music  And a bunch of little children 
[03:07:30]  Of Indonesian descent  Going  Where's mommy?  Mommy  Yeah  Cause God needs  I hate that when they go  I just want one of these  I can't have two  I'm trying to watch my figure  If I don't, who will?  I have a donut  You put two together  The donuts  Well, you know  By the way  Steve brought me a note  I have to interject  Pat said this  I hope I didn't sound fat  I hear the radio  It adds ten pounds  But you gotta go  Wow 
[03:08:00]  No, when he has  These little ditties  He's gotta walk in with them  Alright  That's true  That's the beauty  Of him being here  Cause eventually  We will just put them all together  And Pat didn't hear us  So Pat  Come on in here  Really fast  I know you're fat  But move fast for us  Please  Get over there  And say what you just  Wrote down for Steve  Oh, I was hoping  I didn't sound fat  Cause I hear the radio  Puts a hundred pounds on you  His fingers are going  Yeah  Well  I don't like the way  You amended it 
[03:08:30]  It went from ten to a hundred  Yes  It's not funny now  The radio had a hundred pounds  Cause that's not possible  That's way too exaggerated  Ten pounds would be like the norm  I'm not a big fan  Of exaggerated humor  No  If it's slightly exaggerated  Like ten pounds  Nice  A hundred pounds  What?  Fifty thousand isn't a lot of money  Should have been  Ten dollars isn't a lot of money  Yeah  When you don't have  Health insurance  Like me  It's tragedy  But I turn tragedy  Into something  Close to an arm  And a toe  All right Pat 
[03:09:00]  You turn tragedy  Into blank stares  You sure do  Get him out of here  Thank you Pat  There he goes  Oh he's rushing off  All right finally Anthony  He's awful  Did you see his little fingers moving  His fingers move  I swear to god  He almost said  My chickadee  Ah yes  I go from enjoying him  To hating him  Really fast  I seem to have lost a toe  Somewhere  WC  Whale cow  People can't decide  What I look like  Get out of here toe 
[03:09:30]  You bother me  Never work with animals  Children  Or all your toes  I believe I'll have another  Eggnog  All right  Under laughter in heaven  There's another letter  To the editor  This is even worse  Than the first one  No way  You ready for this one  From Little Neck  Frederick writes  Oh boy 
[03:10:00]  Johnny Carson  Truly an icon  In American entertainment  Was a national institution  For 30 years  He gave us a smooth  Nightcap of banter  And heartland charm  I guess maybe  God needs a few  Of Johnny's jokes  To cheer him up  As he looks at  Mankind today  Wait  What  Can't God get NBC  And watch his  Order the old CDs  He can order the old DVDs  I'm sure God has a DVD player 
[03:10:30]  He's God  For God's sake  Wait a minute  God needs a laugh  Well yeah  They're trying to explain  Why Johnny had to go  Anthony  Yeah  He finishes his little letter  I guess maybe God  Needs a few of Johnny's jokes  To cheer him up  As he looks at  Mankind today  Because today  It's so bad  That God would need  Something to make him laugh  He didn't  Take Johnny  Years during the Vietnam War  But God is  Causing all the havoc  Yeah  Like the tsunami was  Quote  An act of God  A lot of people are saying 
[03:11:00]  Yeah wait a minute  So he could have like  If God caused the tsunami  Why would he  So God is so cruel  That he could kill  A quarter million people  And then kick back  Put his feet up  And laugh at Johnny  That he just killed  Right  Plus according to 97  God's laughing  As the bodies wash away  Anyway  Right  Did I say God's laughing  Yeah whatever  Okay I said it right  That's what I meant to say  After killing a quarter million  You said God 97  Yeah listen to 97  According to 97  God is laughing  While the bodies are washed  I thought you meant  Hot 97 
[03:11:30]  But I think you said  God 97  You did say God 97  Oh no  You said God  We're going to have to  Listen to the tape  No you said God 97  God did your brain  Short circuit  You point out  Every time I make a mistake  You said God 97  Oh yeah you did  I didn't  Am I right or wrong  Hawk I didn't  He said God 97  Hawk knows  Everyone says no  Nope  Hawk did I say no  That's how hot comes out  When you got a big huge  Whatever you're eating  In your face  Four hours from now  You will either  Be right or wrong  Apology from me  Or I will laugh my ass off  Yeah four hours from now  I'll just ring you up 
[03:12:00]  Okay you're right  I'm sorry  You think Johnny  Instead of talking  Into a microphone  To make God laugh  Is talking in a patch  Severed toe  Is it up there  It's gotta be  It led a good life  I guess maybe God  Needs a few of Johnny's jokes  To cheer him up  As he looks at mankind today  So he kills a quarter million people  And then he wants to sit back  And enjoy a few one liners  Yeah why didn't have Johnny  Just sending the jokes in  Like he does to Letterman  Man that's awful  Tsunami  Tsunami  That is just awful  Awful stuff  What do you do to Nami 
[03:12:30]  When he hits you with his car  That's really good  I didn't know  I was working with such a talented  Talented guy  Wow  That's pretty damn funny man  Johnny from Munaki  Johnny from Munaki 
[03:13:00]  My toe came up  May my toe fall in your milkshake  Justin what's up  Hey you guys get a Super Bowl trip together  Or what  I don't know  You know  XM once again letting us down  You know  They want us to bring the program  To the next level  But they can't even get us  A damn Super Bowl trip  To give away  I mean  Well they said yesterday  They're working on it  So we'll see  We may get it yeah  We'll see what happens 
[03:13:30]  They're working on it  You know  I'm starting to read between the lines  Are you  I'm starting to realize  That a lot of things  They tell us down there in Washington  Is all BS  I must say  It's just fluffany  Filler  Bunk  Bunk  If you will  Speaking of the Super Bowl  We got this email from Greg in Virginia  Guys I'm originally from Philly  And heard on the news today  That Mayor John Street  Who is I guess the mayor of Philly  Is having a hard time reaching a deal  With your hero Mayor Menino  The mayor of Boston 
[03:14:00]  You know how the mayors  Have to do their Super Bowl bets  Right now  No I've never heard that before  Is that common practice  Ready for this though  Apparently Menino  Must be a health nut  Because he turned down  Street's bed of a cheesesteak  Claiming that they are  Too high in cholesterol  Yeah he's a health nut  He sounds like a good time to me  See how fat he is  Menino's not in shape  He's really turned down the bet  All the cholesterol goes to my tongue  He's got that big fat mongoloid tongue  Obviously the mayors  Have to do the famous New England  Clam chowder for a Philly cheesesteak 
[03:14:30]  Boring crap like that  Menino  Menino  It's L's brother  Menino cheesesteak  Too much cholesterol  May a fat diabetic  Pummel you with unfunny  One liners  Let's all look at him 
[03:15:00]  And make him make a face  He's just sitting outside our window  Of our studio  It's like watching  You guys are so obsessed with him  Del Griffin from Munaki  We should have him recite the line  From Planes, Trains, and Automobile  Automobiles  Come on hurt me  Who doesn't love him  Alright  We're taking a think break for a second here 
[03:15:30]  What are you doing there Eric?  Oh you want to do the  We've got plenty of stuff  Yeah I know  I know  But I'm just trying to think  I just want to see what they were upset about  The Parents Television Council  We were talking about them yesterday  99.8% of all complaints that go into the FCC  Come from the Parents Television Council  They monitor everything  Radio, television  For things that they find offensive  And then have their flock  Write letters to the FCC  Whether they heard these things  Or saw them on TV or not 
[03:16:00]  They instruct their people  How to fill out these FCC complaints  And send them in  So it's not really using the FCC  Like it's supposed to be  If you're offended by something you hear  You believe it's indecent  And against the rules that the FCC has set forth  You can complain  The way they have it set up  It's like a chain letter  Or a mailing list  It has nothing to do with the way  The FCC was supposed to be set up  And on their website  We found like five clips  That they posted video of 
[03:16:30]  From television  Shows that they deem offensive  Scenes in these shows  That are offensive  That you could then watch the video  And then mail in a complaint  As if you were watching the program  Completely different than  It was supposed to work  Sure  So we just have a couple of these shows  What is this one?  A sex scene from Life As We Know It  Teen Orgy from Without A Trace  They got the Motley Crue on The Tonight Show  I guess when he dropped the F-bomb  Do we have that? 
[03:17:00]  Yeah we got it all  Did they bleep it for their website?  Or is it going out live?  How could they bleep it?  You wouldn't know what they said  That's true  It's really time to add the F-word  To the English language  Let's all calm down about the F-word  Every single person uses it  That's how bad we're getting into society  It now makes the drudge report and news  Whenever a celebrity slips on television  That is what we've turned into  Bono said the F-word  Motley Crue said the F-word  We are obsessed with language  I mean look  I'm fairly conservative with crime and punishment  But this administration is disgusting 
[03:17:30]  Disgusting  Letting the F-bomb slip  Or be broadcast on television  Isn't against FCC regulations by the way  It's been done  Saving Private Ryan  They played it and the FCC said  No that's fine  It has nothing to do  What they don't like  Is the pandering  And it being used to titillate  Or excite  That's the stuff that upsets them  If someone gets on  And lets the F-bomb slip by accident  Talking about winning an award 
[03:18:00]  And saying this is effing great  You know  And not using it in a sexual way  Has nothing to do with that FCC violation  But now people just freak out  And say well you gotta find them  So um  What do you wanna start with?  We'll go from the top  I don't even know this show  Life as we know it  Anyone know?  I've never heard of that  You ever heard of that?  No  Life as we know it  The sex scene  I don't know how this is good  They're very offended by this scene  From life as we know it  Oh this sucks 
[03:18:30]  Don't we need the video?  We kind of would like to see that  Did anyone listen to these clips  To make sure they work for radio?  I'm ready to  I'm ready to send a letter  And that sounds very offensive  Sounds very hot  Teens moaning, groaning  And breathing heavily  We hear the sex noises  Nice  Is there a girl in there?  It's okay 
[03:19:00]  You can stop  I don't mind  No, I don't  Wanna stop  It's not stop  Why isn't it working?  Stop thinking about Jackie  Stop thinking about Jackie  Yeah  Yeah, stop thinking about Jackie  Hey  You did that  It smells like old chemicals in here  Maybe that's it  Bleach?  Yeah, that's it  This is what they're upset about? 
[03:19:30]  What, the guy can't get a rod?  Why don't we go back to the dance  Have some fun  And try it again later  Aw, you think  That's cool  Aw, what a loser  What's the problem?  Every single male  On the parent's television council  Suffers from that problem  How embarrassing  The guy couldn't get a rod  Aw  What, were they in a cleaning closet  Or something?  They had a little school dance  And they slipped away 
[03:20:00]  To have a little nookie  Teen sex  The poor guy  Couldn't get it up  Reggae TV teen sex  What the hell  You know  It's nothing to complain about  I'm sure they weren't  Showing anything that  No bare asses or anything  It was probably just the audio  That upset these people  Yeah, I'm sure  I'm sure there was  Heavy petting  Heavy petting?  Ever read that  In the old Land Landers?  We've  I'm just starting to go out  With somebody  We've kissed  And done some heavy petting 
[03:20:30]  Heavy petting?  Is that meant literally  Like you're petting the person?  I think it means groping  I think it means cupping  Yeah  Where do they get that word though?  Petting  Because it's the way you're touching  It's a way of saying it in the paper  You don't want to say  I've been cupping  And dipping fingers in  Well the term comes from  When the girls used to grow  Those big beavers  Oh and you would pet it?  Yeah, okay  Sure, sometimes we do  Some heavy petting  And then I'd have to  Put on a pad 
[03:21:00]  Oh, back to Chicago  You unsexy wench  With a belt  I'd put on belts  And pads  Pads  You know  But we're sexually active  Alright, well why don't you  Get the next one up, Eric  That'll work  We'll watch the video  To hopefully describe  Just in case  The next one is meant for TV  And not radio  We will watch it for you  Alright, the next one is  Without a Trace  Teen Orgy scene  Teen Orgy  Without a Trace  Okay  Alright, this one they complained about 
[03:21:30]  7500 broadcast  Indecency complaints  7500  All of them from the same place  Right  You jackasses  Alright  Well, we'll just play it  Here it is  The party was at his house  They usually are  We hang out after school  Is that a girl topless  Or is that a guy  With man boobs  It's a guy with man boobs 
[03:22:00]  They try to fool us  It's a steamy scene  In a room  With a bunch of couples  Having sex  But there's nothing  It's a team party  A black guy kissing a white girl  Now I am offended  Yep  Filmed very suggestively  Very smoky  Girls were walking around in bras  Yep  Wow  A little dry humping going on  Let me tell you  Lots of drinking  This is a hot scene  This really is very hot  Holy Jesus  Now the girls are in their bras  And they're taking a look inside

[03:23:30]  That's one  You can almost understand  Why they would complain  About being on TV  It's like eh  You know sometimes  You gotta look at it  And go alright  You know they want  For broadcast TV  That might be too rough  Too lazy  Yeah I mean every complaint  Isn't gonna be completely ridiculous  And that might be one  That's too visual  It's the language  I have the main problem with  That was just very very  Very very hot  See  It really was  Watch that again  Yeah go  What's the website  PTC  Parentstv.org  Alright and it's the clip  Without a trace  We just watched 
[03:24:00]  Alright Anthony  Here's the next example  It's really basic and easy  Self explanatory  Hey Tony  Happy fucking New Year man  That's it  Alright  Happy fucking New Year  Motley Crue on the Tonight Show  Nice  Well the Paris Television Council  So the main problem with that  Is it was taped in July  Goddamn drug abusers  They don't even know  Yeah they don't even know  What holiday it is 
[03:24:30]  Oh okay  This is a commercial  They had a problem with  I think the most offensive thing  Was that the ball  Was dropping from Tommy's pole  It's just  So big  Yeah  There's hepatitis  All over the ball  Alright it's a  Dentine commercial Anthony  They had  I've seen this one  And what's the problem  With this dentine commercial  It's really weird  It's like  It's a  A son or daughter  I'm not sure which  Sitting on the couch  With their boyfriend  Or girlfriend  Whatever it is  On one couch 
[03:25:00]  The parents of one of them  Are sitting on another couch  They pull out the dentine  And the kids  Start making out  On the couch  In front of the parents  And the parents  I guess  Get a little influenced  By the dentine  Or by what they're doing  And start making out  On the couch  So it's  It's like a kid  And their  Date  And the parents  Going at it  On two couches  In the same room  It's a little odd  When I saw this  I was like  Ew that's kind of  A creepy commercial  Alright let's hit play here 
[03:25:30]  Boom  Mom, dad  This is Kevin  Kevin it's great to meet you  Hi Kevin  Since we just talk  About you all the time  She does  Thank you for having me  Over for dinner  I hope you're really hungry  Susie tells me  You're on the  Wrestling team  I've  Dentine fire  Go bold  They're just  Going at it  Holy ass 
[03:26:00]  That's pretty  That's pretty hot too  She throws her shirt  And it hits her father  In the face  Dentine fire  Now the mother  Has some gum  And they start making out  Now the parents  And the kids  Are making out  Like on couches  That are right next to each other  You don't want to be really hot  If the father yelled out  Switch partners  You know what the good part is  When the father  Goes up to the boy  The boyfriend  And rests his head  On his shoulder  And as the boyfriend 
[03:26:30]  Finishes him off  He goes  The father puts his face  In the boyfriend's neck  And his mustache  Tickles the boyfriend's neck  And it doesn't spur  As little things  Burble over the boyfriend's hand  The father goes  And I would  I would tell her  That she'd walk down  And she'd see me  And her dad there  And both of our pants  Would just be pulled down  To mid-thigh  We wouldn't be naked  Our pants would be pulled down  Above our knees  On the couch  To men  Jimmy would tell 
[03:27:00]  His girlfriend  These stories  He would like  Suggest these fantasies  Or play them out  Verbally to his girlfriend  Who would then have  These horrific images  In her head  Like of me sexually  Interacting with her  Family members  One of my favorites  Was me and her grandmother  That I would pin her  Grandmother up  Against the counter  And bump and grind her  And reach around  And squeeze her ass  And just kind of hold her  And grind her  Against the counter  What would she say  There would be something  In every image  I think in the father image 
[03:27:30]  It was when he put his face  In my neck  It went  She said that was  The worst part  It was his face  Disappearing into your neck  And in the grandmother thing  I think it was the fact  That as I was pressing her  Against the counter  I was reaching around  And holding her ass  Right, right  There was something  So graphic  That really is bad  And awful  I forget what other ones  I had one with her brother  One with her mother  Her grandfather  I remember the family  That was a new one  That is really funny  And really disturbing  I really bothered her  That is hilarious 
[03:28:00]  But that's anything commercial  That's not obscene  That's just funny  That's hilarious  It's funny and really hot too  Because they start  Chewing the gum  And then the teenage girl  Just jumps on her boyfriend  And unbuttons her shirt  She's in her bra  Throws her shirt  And it hits her father  And the father's trying to talk  Like a father would  To a boy that's coming  And bringing the daughter out  And they're just going at it  On the couch  It's kind of funny  That's very funny  And then the parents  Start going at it  But that's not obscene  That's just  That's funny  You got to know  Where to pick your spots  As you would say  They want an FCC complaint  For what?  For that  I don't know  But they want it 
[03:28:30]  Alright and finally  It's South Park  One of our favorites  South Park  This is from the  Paris Hilton  Whore-Off episode  And they were  Bitching  What's their line  When you subscribe  To Basic Cable  Exactly what are you  Paying for?  Take a look  It's cable  Yeah  They don't care  It's not broadcast  The FCC can't control cable  Can they?  No  They don't care though  Big orgy scene  What is Mrs. Link doing? 
[03:29:00]  He's just sitting there  Give him time  Give him time  Come on  Back off  None of you losers  Are enough for me  Paris Hilton  Oh yeah  She's shoving a pineapple  Inside her  Ta-da  And the pineapple  Disappeared  Oh no she didn't  This is part of the  Four-Off competition  Anthony  And now a Steve  Looking character 
[03:29:30]  Walked up to  Paris Hilton  A cuddly bear type  That's Mr. Slave  Mr. Slave  Mr. Slave  Yeah  And he's  Jealous  What did he do?  Taking his pants off  Okay  Oh my god  He just jumped on  Paris Hilton  And he's  He's putting her  In his ass  Oh my god  That's hilarious  Jealous 
[03:30:00]  That is sick  Alright so it's the  Whore-Off  And Paris Hilton  Makes a pineapple  Disappear  And then there's  This Steve type  This gay guy  He's not a Steve type  He's like a  Village people guy  Yeah he's  One of these  Leather gay guys  Jumps on top  Of Paris Hilton's head  And makes Paris Hilton  Disappear 
[03:30:30]  Disappear  And he's screaming  It's cable  Yes  The FCC does not  Control cable television  They're self-policed  Right exactly  It's a pay service  Yep  God all  This  That's the agenda  Of the Paris television  That's how you know  How disingenuous  And self-obsessed  With their own ideology  They are  Yep  They don't want  This stuff out there  They don't care about  The rules that are in place  They don't care about  The rules that are in place  And enforcing them  They want it changed  They want this stuff  Eliminated 
[03:31:00]  When you're paying for cable  This is what you're paying for  Well tomorrow  I'll play some clips  From the Boston thing  And you can see  When you're sending  Your children to church  This is what you're  Sending them to  There you go  Some of the Paul  What's his last name  Shamley  Yeah we got some of that  So when you're sending  Your children off  To serve God  That's what you're  Serving them to do  What a kind gentleman  He looks like  Sitting in that courtroom  With his little hearing aid  Yeah  Sure  Well I guess his hearing  From kids yelling  In his ears  Stop it hurts  I guess that blew out  One of his eardrums  Years ago  Wow that's 
[03:31:30]  Ouch  Good observation  There you go  So you can  You know  Play along at home  Go to  Parentstv.org  That's going to  Become one of my  Favorite websites  I'm going to have to  Go there for a ton of time  Find the clip of the week  Clip of the week they do  Worst of the week clips  Gallery  I think worst of  Is the rib off of you guys  I don't like that  Yeah really  And that goes back  To the whole tsunami thing  Like they feel this stuff  Is titillating  Right  But now people  Are going to be titillated  By going to their website  Checking out these clips  But it's okay 
[03:32:00]  Because they think  They're getting something  Done by doing it  I think people that go there  Should watch the clips  And then there's a place  You can email  The PTC higher ups  And let them know  If you enjoyed  Some of the clips  Yeah  And enjoy their website  Tell them what you think  Of the clips  Because they're posting  The clips for you to watch  Right  I think you should all  Email the parents  Television council  And let them know  Your honest opinions  About those clips  There you go  All right  Now serious emails only  Oh of course Jimmy  Well it's time  And we just fight back  It really is  No shenanigans  I mean we're just one 
[03:32:30]  Stupid tiny little radio show  But I think these big huge companies  Have got to start saying  Enough is enough  With this group  To these small groups  To this small group  If this group  Didn't file complaints  The FCC would be  Twiddling their thumbs  Right  Nothing to do  All right  As we go to break  Drew Boogie is in studio  He came in with a bunch  Of new remixes  And I think we got  Oh the volume controls  Are killing everybody  I know  Guys  I'm in the same boat  Through my headphones  I had to keep turning  My headphones down  I was trying  The clips we were playing  Were so utterly loud 
[03:33:00]  And um  Yeah  I don't  I  Why  Why  Why  And it's been like that  Since we got here  Anything besides us talking  Into these microphones  Is much louder  There should be a  Master processing thing  That happens just to smooth out  All the levels  Equals out everything  No matter what's coming out  We should have to be  Riding levels the whole show  Like oh is the phones too loud  This clip's going to be too loud  That  In regular radio  You never have to worry about that  If something was recorded  A little too hot 
[03:33:30]  Or a little too soft  There's a processing  That happens  That brings everything  To a normal level  Where you're not adjusting  At home  You're your dial  Right  I don't get it  And to have Opie  The guy in control  Of riding the levels  Is probably the worst thing  Because I lost my hearing  Years ago  From doing radio  It's so loud  In his headphones  So that's where we are  We gotta  We gotta do something  About the levels  That I think  Should be top priority  Over any other thing  Technically  I bet you they won't do it  What will you do  I bet you they won't do it 
[03:34:00]  And I'll tell you why  Because the processors  Were compressors  And they put air  Into the whole mix  Even though it's a talk show  And it shouldn't matter  They don't want it to be  Like terrestrial radio  Where you know  When somebody didn't talk  All you heard was  Yeah  The processors  When they have to turn things up  It puts air into the mix  And since it's satellite  They're probably gonna be against that  They want it to be  As clean and crisp as possible  I don't know  They have to do something  About this problem  This is the number one problem  We have technically  With this show  Is the levels 
[03:34:30]  The listeners  Are pissed off  On a daily basis  Because of the levels  Yeah Kevin Straley  Enough with the stupid meetings  Where nothing gets done  This is what we need fixed  This is it  And they said  They  And they talk about it  Like  Whenever I've heard  This problem discussed  I go  No  That's not the problem  They're talking about it  Like  No well  We have it boosted louder  At the  At the  No something  In Washington  And then everything  Gets louder  No  We need  Our mics  Everything that we do 
[03:35:00]  Has to be the equal level  And our whole channel  Has to be  We shouldn't have to be  Worried about riding levels  The whole show  It's just  It's just not how it's done  Everything should be processed  Right  Who's in charge of this crap  This is the first high profile  Radio show  On satellite radio  So maybe they're not used to this  Because  When you're doing just  A music show  And it's a jock  And music very easy  Very easy  The music on this level  Jock on this level  But when you do a type of show  Like Anthony and I  We're going to all sorts of sources  All the time  And it's not  The system in place 
[03:35:30]  Is not working  So when are we going to figure it out  We're four months into this  Don't screw with the board  Don't screw with our headphones  Don't screw with any  All you got to do  Is boost the level  Of our  What we say  Yeah the mics  Aren't loud enough  These mics need boost  Those levels should not be  All the way up like that  They shouldn't  These mics aren't loud enough  That's why everything else  Comes in blasting  When you play it  Because they raise the level  So the mics can be heard  Exactly  Instead of lowering  The other things 
[03:36:00]  And raising the mics  The whole channel  First of all  The whole channel is low  It's lower than the rest of XM  The whole channel  And then on top of that  Our vocals  Our mics  Are lower than anything we play  So if we go to a bit  Or sound clips  Audio from the news  It's much louder  It's much louder  And then if you turn  The mics up too loud  It'll just distort  And you can't hear the phones  When people are calling in  They can't hear us  We can't hear them  It's a nightmare  Well you know  In the beginning we understood  Because it was a brand new situation 
[03:36:30]  Brand new studio  But we're four months into this  And we're still getting  The same complaints  Yeah  Kevin work on that  Please  That's the one  And I don't want to hear  Thursday  I'll look into that  I'll get back to you  We're working on that  No  Take care of the fucking problem  Immediately  We're four months into this  This should not even be an issue anymore  The first  I'll give you  The first month of course  We're figuring out the bugs  And we're adjusting levels  And doing all that  But the system in place  Is not working  I'm not a dope 
[03:37:00]  You know  I'm riding these levels  Where they should be  And when I see something  Is too hot  Then I'm lowering them  It's just  But it's not  We shouldn't have to worry about that  No  There should be some kind of processing  That just  Kind of  In a way  Equalizes all the levels  So you're not blasting people out  Right  It's called a limiter  We need limiters  Yes  It's ridiculous  It really is ridiculous  And they're sick of hearing this bitch  But you know  This is a problem  That started week one 
[03:37:30]  We understood  We're four months into it  Just about  Four months into it  And the listeners are bitching  Yeah I know  The listeners are complaining  It's bad enough  We gotta sit here  And ride the  The headphone controls  Every two seconds  That we're playing clips  But you know  It's the listeners  That are bitching about this  And it is annoying  Because you're not  Not everyone is sitting there  Right next to their radio  Yeah  Riding the volume knob  For the entire show  Most people are off  Working somewhere  And then it comes in blasting  They gotta run back  Turn it up  Turn it down  It's a pain in the ass 
[03:38:00]  And there you go  It's gotta be fixed immediately  Now we're just wasting  Another ten minutes of our show  Bitching about stupid crap  That we shouldn't be  Bitching about anymore  And the phones still don't work  Every day people are complaining  The phone levels aren't good  Yeah  So figure out why  And fix it  This is top priority  Put this on the red sheet  Where's the number one list  We're going down to Washington  Monday and Tuesday  Great  So we'll sit in a meeting  And they'll go  Well we're looking into this  We're looking into that 
[03:38:30]  We're looking into marketing  We're looking into your Super Bowl trip  Looking, looking, looking, looking  We go to Washington  Let's go right to the tech guys  Let us go right there  And go  Guys  Here's what we're dealing with  What can we do  And I guarantee you  They will have a solution  To the problem  Because it won't be  Twenty in between guys  Conveying our concerns  To the tech guys  It'll be us going  Hey guys  Oh that?  Oh yeah  Here  Click, click, click  Problem solved  Guaranteed that's what happens 
[03:39:00]  We want to be the hottest radio show  In America  And they're not making it easy  For us down there at all  They're just not  Don't complain  People won't help you  I know  And then we complain  Because we  We, you know  We're highly motivated here  And then people feel like  Oh we don't really want to  Help them  Because they bitch too much  Tough crap  That's your job  For months here  And the problem still being there  And we address this problem  Like the first week  We were on the air  That perhaps we have  A reason to  To bitch 
[03:39:30]  If that's what we're doing  About the volume  We've been talking about it  For, I remember  The first week  We were on the air  We talked about it  Problem still there  It's a technical problem  That can be fixed  It's not a creative problem  That we have to sit  And art out  This is something technical  It's a flip of a switch  A button  A reprogramming of something  There's things in place  There's technology available  That can fix this  Why hasn't it been done? 
[03:40:00]  Look here  To the gang in Washington  If you want Ant and I  To do a mediocre show  Just let us know  I'll come in here  And I'll just do a mediocre show  I won't bitch  I'll have an  I don't care attitude  I don't care  I just don't care  I said an  I don't care attitude  I don't care  I'll always care  But if you want a mediocre show  Just send us an email  Guys  No you're right  We just want a mediocre show  We have 130 music channels  And a whole bunch  Of other channels  And quite frankly  It just doesn't matter  If you guys are successful  Let me know 
[03:40:30]  Let me know  So I can sleep at night  We'll just come in here  Every day  And we'll just do a mediocre show  No problem  Right  We'll lose subscribers  But we'll have just enough  To survive  And we'll get paid  And you'll be happy  And that's it  If that's what you want  Let me know  Please  Save me the hassle  Because nothing's happening  At the other company  That's going to cause  Any concerns in a year  I mean there really is  No reason to move  Because it's not like  Anybody is going  To the other company  That might boost  Subscribers for them  So there's really no need  To make this show work  We want to be  The hottest show in America  But you guys are definitely  Making it hard for us 
[03:41:00]  And if you want a mediocre show  Please let me know  I've been at this  Since I was 18  I'm ready to call it in  I don't care  I got enough money  I'll do a mediocre show  Until you realize  50 grand isn't that much  Until you realize  It's mediocre  And then you fire us  And whatever  I'll move on  Or if you want to help us  Become on top of the radio world again  Then let's go  Let's go  Where's our Super Bowl tickets  Let's go  Help us out  Where's the marketing  Let's go  One thing at a time  Top priority  Enough with this 
[03:41:30]  Fix the levels  I'm working on that  I'll look into that  I'll look into this  I'm going to look into  The fact that I was  Looking into that last week  To give you an update  But what?  Yeah  Give me something concrete  Or are you waiting for us  To get to Washington  To tell us all the great stuff  That's going to be happening  On the show  Get us off the premium channel  Fix the freaking audio levels  Of this channel  202  Get us some good marketing things  Like a Super Bowl trip  Or billboards 
[03:42:00]  Whatever  I'll leave that to you  You guys supposedly are the experts  But let's go  Where is this stuff?  No more speeches  And cute little breakfasts  In Vegas  How blah blah blah blah blah  We need better communication  With you guys  And blah blah blah blah blah  We need this and this and that  Well need need need  Well I'm waiting for action  Where is it?  We were in Vegas  What?  Two and a half  Three weeks ago already?  We had some great little  Sit down meetings  At breakfast  But what has happened  Since then?  Nothing  Absolutely nothing  Well we missed our meeting 
[03:42:30]  Just tell me  If you want a mediocre show  Trust me  I've been doing this  For a long time  I'm ready  I'm ready to just call it in  I don't need to lose sleep  On this show anymore  Just tell me  We'll all get on the same page  Mediocre radio  No problem  I'll start tomorrow  Ant will start tomorrow  Jimmy will start tomorrow  I've actually started in October  Yeah  Doing mediocre things  I mean it's tough enough  To get this show back  To where it used to be  You know  We're still not happy  Where the show is  But we're moving  In the right direction  Just fix the god damn levels  Please  Fix the god damn levels 
[03:43:00]  But it shows  An I don't care attitude  In general  That this was something  That's been going on  Since day one  Right  It's a problem  And I told them  It's some kind of processing  That needs to just  Get all the levels  In an area  Where no one would ever  Have to adjust the volume  On their radios  When they're listening to us  And Ant's right  If you go to a tech guy  A tech guy  Oh yeah this  But it's not the tech guy  It's the fact that  Every corporation  And it's not just  Every corporation  There's 50  Mid management guys  That don't know  Well you know  Yeah we'll talk  That's the way  So it's not getting 
[03:43:30]  To the tech guy  Or if it is  It's so watered down  He has no idea  What the hell  He's supposed to do  Right  Because it's coming  At one of 30 emails  From 30 different people  Right  All mid-level management  That's every corporation  In the country  That does that  If we walked up  To a tech guy  When we go to Washington  I want to go down  In the basement  Walk up to a tech guy  And just say  Here's the problem  Blah blah blah blah blah blah  And guaranteed  They will go  Oh yeah  Here's what's got to be done  Yeah we'll get on that  We'll do it  And then fix it  Let's do it ourselves  When we go down there  We've shown a lot of patience  But it's time for action  Real action 
[03:44:00]  This premium channel thing  Is for the birds man  I mean you're hiding  The show to begin with  I mean let's go  Let's move forward  Enough already  God  You know Howard's  He's going to kick your ass  You just know it  Because I don't see  I don't see anything happening  We have such a head start  And he's going to kick our ass  That's the problem  You don't want to be playing  Catch up in a year  When you don't have to be 
[03:44:30]  I remember when Howard signed  You know it was literally  A few weeks after we started  Two days  It was like two days  I don't even  I was going to  All right whatever  So I mean  You should have heard  The phone calls I took  All right here's the deal  Yeah he signed  But he's not going on until 2006  It's our priority  To make you guys  As big as possible  Within the next year  And two months  I remember all the  Rah rah speeches  We'll put a billboard  Right in front of his apartment  So he has to stare  At your stupid faces every day  I mean they were so motivated  With all the things  They were going to do  Four months later 
[03:45:00]  I'm so sick of the talk  Just do something  Show us something  Show us something  What's going to happen  What's going to happen  Is people that  The markets that you guys  Were huge in  Like Philadelphia  Boston  People that still  Don't know you're on  Certainly know where  Howard's going  Because the company  Puts his face  At the forefront  So what they're going to do  Is when they decide  To buy a satellite radio  They're going to go out  And get serious  Because they know  Where he is  And then  Oh you guys are on 
[03:45:30]  Next time  We didn't even  Hear about that  I still get emails  From people  When did you guys  Go back on  I don't know  I don't know  But they say  Yeah whatever  All right  Ben is panicking  We have to break  What's the matter sweetie  Now we just spent 15 minutes  And we had other  Really cool things  To get to today  But there you go  That's what happens  Because it's a reality show  Kind of  And that's what's  Biling us now  Today  Fix the levels  Fix the levels  That's all  Thank you  And don't call me  After the show  I'm not taking any  Phone calls from XM today  What's the problem

Listen man, it's a pleasure  To have you back on the air  Stop sweating the small stuff  It's not small stuff  Trust me  This goes a lot deeper  Than stupid levels  On a radio program  Yeah, I know  You know, but for the fans out there  It's bullshit just to raise  The radio a little higher  A little lower  Yeah, it's easy  Because you're driving  We're getting a lot of  Dude, the reason that we complain  Is because we're getting  A lot of complaints from people  On emails 
[03:52:00]  And when they call in  It's like  It's not just one guy calling  It's like  You hear the same thing  From people all over the country  It's like a distraction  And then people can't enjoy  The show as much  And you know what  I kind of wait to bits  Until I see that  There's a pattern going on  All right  And this whole thing  About the levels of the show  Has been creeping into  The instant feedback  And the email  Ever since we started  And it's just a pattern  And then you have to  Explode and talk about it  Well, it's Clear Channel  You guys are working for 
[03:52:30]  After all, isn't it?  No  Not really  Oh, that old rumor gag  Nah, no  That's not true  You know, Clear Channel  Owns 90% of XM  I don't know  You know, I only know  Yeah, you know enough  That you blurted that out  They have such  Dude, they have such  A small interest in XM  I know  Like any shareholder  They had a big interest  And they  Had a big interest  At the beginning  And it's been diluted down  And sold off  And now they  Barely have any  Let's go to Anthony  In Jersey  Go ahead, Anthony 
[03:53:00]  Hey guys  It's a pleasure  To be on  Norton and Friends  This morning  Norton and Friends  Hey fellas  Listen, big huge fan  I've spoken to you guys before  Cool  I'll tell you  I've been with you guys  For day one  On XM  And you know  Not only being a huge fan  Of you guys  I mean, I own stock  In XM  And it's deplorable  Deplorable  On how the company  Markets you guys  I mean, you see  All the billboards  When you come in  In and out of the city  There's so many people  That don't even know  You guys are on  You see the 
[03:53:30]  Wow stickers on the road  They're all still  From WNEW  You never see any  From XM  Terrible job  They don't even have to  Go out and try to find  New listeners for the show  If they just informed  The old listeners  Where we were  You know something  A lot of our old listeners  Have no clue  Where we are  That we're here  On XM  The marketing of this program  Gets a C-  At best  But let's  Are we going down there  Next week  They said that there's  Definitely a plan  So look  Maybe the plan 
[03:54:00]  Is going to start  Very soon  I say we got to  Give them that  When we meet them  Because they  They did say  There's a plan  They're going to  Present it with a plan  So let's see what it is  Plan nine  Might be a great one  A plan  We haven't even  Talked to the marketing guy  In two and a half  I don't know  Well he hates us  But I mean  We'll still see if there's a plan  Two months at least  You know  I'm willing to  Every weekend  Go somewhere else  To promote this show  But there's been  Nothing  Nothing said  I'll do it myself  I don't care  I'm more than willing  Because I'm willing  If the plan makes sense  I'll redo this 
[03:54:30]  Right thank you  I'm willing to go anywhere  That makes sense  Okay  Dude I'll go anywhere  To promote this show  Do you think I care this weekend  I'm going to Albany  To promote it  That the comedy works  That's why I'm going  To promote this show  My stupid two shows  Friday  Two shows Saturday  Go to my shows  We haven't even had a  We haven't had a marketing discussion  In over two months  Ever  Over two months  Ever  Well in the beginning  There were huge plans for us  And stuff  But since then  Nothing  And you know  Don't even say  It's a budget thing  And it's money  There's so many little things  You could do  That has nothing to do 
[03:55:00]  With spending money  If that's their problem  They just don't care  They don't care  About us  In the big plan  They just don't  We're just a tiny  Tiny little piece  That's it  Oh well  That's it  So fine  We don't care  We'll just do  Mediocre shows for you  And everyone will be happy  Then you get a show  That doesn't bitch  People are suggesting  We're already doing that  And then the subs  Will slowly go down  And then all of a sudden  We'll get a phone call  Guys what happened  What happened 
[03:55:30]  We don't really understand  What happened  I guess it just didn't work guys  I guess it didn't work  What happens next  And then we get fired  Oh okay  And then we go somewhere else  Or we  Then what  Or we retire  I like this story  Then what  Well wait a minute  I don't like this  That'll be the classic thing  Guys  It just didn't work  I don't know what happened  You know  It just didn't work  I'm sorry  You know whatever  Alright  Alright  Drew Boogie  We have time to play this thing

[03:57:00]  I had the yelling parents too  Growing up  Until they got divorced  And it was just  You know  And then you'd see  Like the old man  And take the plate  Full of spaghetti  And throw it  And it would hit  Like the wall  Next to the phone  And you're sitting there  Horrified  Watching the spaghetti  Slowly go down the wall  Fuck you  Get the fuck out of the wall  Fuck you  Oh the horrified kids  Did dad actually leave  After the fights  Yeah a lot of times  Sure  And then you know  You'd be able to go to sleep  Because the yelling would stop  First mom would have to  Wind down a little  That fucking asshole 
[03:57:30]  You know  Even after dad left  She's still going  Eat that shit like  Give me that fucking  I'm trying to sleep  He's gone  Shut up  Shut up  Oh god  He's been gone a half hour  What do you want to come back  The next day?  Yeah like the next day  You know  They'd be sitting down  Watching like  Ronan Martin's laughing  Laughing  Everything was fine  You know  And then out of nowhere  You'd hear the rumbling  You'd be in bed  And you'd be like  Can't you two just shut the fuck up 
[03:58:00]  For like one night  And then we were pretty young  So you know  We got you know  Called into the room  And mom sits down  And goes  Me and your father  I want you to know  And I want you to know  It has nothing to do with you  We're divorced  Oh okay  Can I go out and play now?
