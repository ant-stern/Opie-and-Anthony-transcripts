<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about the hosts taking more Fridays off, despite listener complaints, followed by a review of discarded belongings from the former radio duo JV and Elvis, which included offensive material.  This transitioned into a segment showcasing Opie’s embarrassing old TV demo reel, featuring clips from a Jerry Lewis telethon, PSAs, and commercials.  Opie’s girlfriend’s strong disapproval of the reel was a recurring joke, alongside an uncomfortable retelling of a Linda Blair interview where they repeatedly yelled "The power of Christ compels you!" at her.  The Preppy Killer's parole violations were briefly mentioned. Jimmy Norton was present in studio throughout this portion.

The show then moved on to a discussion of the deaths of Don LaFontaine and Jerry Reed, including a critical review of Reed's song "When You're Hot, You're Hot."  The hosts speculated on Sarah Palin's upcoming Republican National Convention speech, making numerous sexually suggestive comments. Rich Voss joined the show in studio, immediately launching into a heated argument with Mike Birbiglia, filled with personal insults and accusations regarding their comedic careers and a past incident at a Mitch Hedberg tribute.  This argument continued, punctuated by discussions of the Republican Convention and Obama's alleged ties to William Ayers.

The conflict between Voss and Anthony escalated in the next segment, focusing on Voss's perceived exclusion from Anthony's parties and events.  Accusations of violence were made, and the argument involved Mike Birbiglia, escalating to physical posturing. An impromptu Scrabble game between Voss, Birbiglia, and Jim Norton took place concurrently.  Keith ("Keith the cop") was called to clarify the party invitation situation. The conversation included strong opinions on Barack Obama, an anecdote about Bill Burr's CD distribution, and the arrival of JBL, who promoted his new anti-energy drink, "Drank," leading to further offensive exchanges.

JBL's appearance continued into the next segment, discussing his wrestling career, the WWF/WWE name change, and his "Drank" and "Mama Juana" energy drinks.  He engaged in a heated political debate with Rich Voss and callers, covering economic and political issues.  The Scrabble game continued, with Voss's poor performance becoming a recurring joke.  Further side conversations included discussions of Vince McMahon's health, JBL's wrestling anecdotes (including a brawl and a broken nose), and "gayest" wrestling moves.  A heated exchange between Roland, the show's booking agent, and Voss culminated in a tirade from Roland.

The final segment showcased continued chaos with JBL, Voss, and Birbiglia.  The banter involved personal attacks, jabs about their careers and appearances (including mentions of butt plugs), and discussions of Voss's failed television pilots and JBL's wrestling career. Birbiglia left and returned to the studio multiple times.  The segment included a wrestling rumor about Mick Foley and concluded with the selection of "Line of the Day" quotes from the segment's particularly brutal exchanges. Sam Roberts was present at the end to discuss wrestling news.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Look at that.  What happened?  It started Wednesday.  What is that about?  It was a Labor Day.  Oh, yeah.  Now it's Wednesday already.  Oh, that's good news.  Tomorrow's Thursday.  And then by the time it's tomorrow, then you go, tomorrow's Friday. 
[00:00:30]  The week's over.  Let's go.  I'm thinking we should take Friday off.  You don't have any people.  Dude, you just got back.  They just leave.  They don't tell us.  A lot of people bitch because we take time off.  Yeah.  Which means they like the radio show, which is nice.  Thank you.  I was looking at our contract the other day.  Yeah.  Did you know that currently we get five to six weeks a year off? 
[00:01:00]  Really?  Now you tell me if we've come close to taking our vacation time.  Nope.  Exactly.  Nope.  I think it's time to take some Fridays off, my friend.  You know, some of these people also don't realize the summertime is when radio people take time off.  A lot of time off.  Because it's just, it's not really as important in the ratings as is the other months. 
[00:01:30]  Sure.  And the other seasons.  Sure.  So that's why a lot of time is taken off.  But people, you know, they just take off.  Somebody was actually bitching that we didn't tell them that we were going to take off.  Like, what inconvenience did you get?  Did you turn on your radio, hear that it was something you had heard before, and have to turn it off or something? 
[00:02:00]  How inconvenienced are you from that?  They have to get to a message board or something and start.  But why didn't they tell their fans?  They don't care about the fans.  They're not the man.  Whoa.  Copy, paste, blank, CC, blank, CC.  No, that's actually cool, man, that people care that much.  Yeah.  But through their caring, they show hatred.  Well, this is the weirdest radio show in America.  The fans care way more about the show than the hosts. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, apparently.  Oh, well, what are you going to do?  We look at each other and go, oh, yeah, this old gag.  Poll number 877-212-0&A.  I wish Stunt Brain didn't have such a hack name.  It's annoying.  It's Stunt Brain.  How the hell do you read all minds at once?  Yeah, no kidding.  I'm a mind reader.  We were confused by Stunt Brain when we met him because he had a lot of skills.  Yeah.  Came highly recommended by some bigwigs. 
[00:03:00]  You got to check out this Stunt Brain.  But also a lot of experience on douchey shows.  Yeah, a lot of douchey shows.  You're right.  So we were a little frightened to bring him in knowing that he had, you know, worked on  some douchey shows.  Well, the best was when we interviewed him and he brought in Stunt Brain hats thinking  we wanted to just gobble them up.  The exclusive.  You brought in the exclusive Stunt Brain hat?  Oh my God, I need one of these.  Can't get enough of wearing my Stunt Brain hat. 
[00:03:30]  And we're like, I remember Aunt and I were like, we can't hire a Stunt Brain.  And then they threw a couple other, like, college kids at us and we said, all right, well, the  choice is obvious.  I just want to get.  Stunt Brain it is.  I want to get arrested for, like, some horrible crime wearing a Stunt Brain hat and shirt.  Just some kind of obviously involving child, questionable child pictures.  Known in the underworld as Stunt Brain. 
[00:04:00]  Stunt Brain.  Here he is being arrested.  It's Stunt Brain.  Pulling giant computers out of your garage.  Evidence boxes.  All hard drives.  Yeah.  That's funny, man.  Yep.  Let me say hi to Nick in Illinois.  In the middle of nowhere, Nick is calling us.  What's up, Nick?  Good morning, gentlemen.  Good morning, Nick.  And how are you?  I'm good.  I just wanted to say, you guys just got to understand. 
[00:04:30]  I know you deserve all the time off that's in your contract.  You should take it.  But you got to understand, like, I'm a truck driver.  I get up in the morning and I'm ready to go with my four and a half, five hours of continuous  O&A.  And maybe if you could get your staff to do some earlier best stuff or some stuff that  we just didn't hear, like, a week ago, it wouldn't be so bad.  But sometimes you get up and you're like, I just heard that stuff four days ago.  Yeah. 
[00:05:00]  I don't disagree with you.  I mean, we've been doing this for 14 years.  I mean, I think we have a lot of material.  Who's responsible for that?  Dare I say you wrong?  Dave.  Well, thank you, Nick.  All right.  And let's say hi to Dave in Texas.  Dave.  What's up, boys?  How are you?  Come on.  It's not that we're inconvenienced when we turn on the show and hear a best of.  We just think you've either been suspended or fired.  All right.  That's reasonable to assume.  That's why they need us to tell them ahead of time. 
[00:05:30]  Because if all of a sudden they turn on the radio, we're not there.  That's how it has happened a few times in the past.  Yeah.  We just kind of disappear.  Y'all have a good day, guys.  The old disappearing act.  Yeah.  Radio is known for the old disappearing act.  We will reappear in two years.  Watch this trick.  You know what's said?  In the hallway is a box filled with JV and Elvis stuff they're throwing out today.  Is that what that stuff is?  Yes.  Wait.  All those?  Yes.  That's it, huh?  JV and Elvis. 
[00:06:00]  Can we pill for it?  A fine radio show we didn't get along with at first, but then ended up getting along with.  Got fired for some.  You never hear that story with us.  Huh?  Oh, no kidding.  You never hear that story with us.  Got fired for, in my opinion, doing some pretty innocent stuff as they try to entertain their audience.  And this is what happens.  There's a radio, you just disappear, and then eventually they throw your stuff out.  It's in the hallway getting thrown out today.  Is that what all those CDs are in there?  Maybe E-Rock should save the box and maybe call up JV and Elvis and ask if they might want this stuff. 
[00:06:30]  Why don't we just pill for it?  Huh?  I heard they broke up.  Oh, really?  I don't know if that's true.  It might be nonsense.  They broke up?  Yeah.  Why?  I heard they were trying an internet radio show at one point.  Yeah, they had it all set up, and then there was just a fallout between them, and Elvis left.  So, JV's starting over.  All right.  And that's the box of stuff that the company's thrown out today.  What is this radio chick stuff?  Chick IDs.  Oh, and radio chick stuff.  All right.  That ought to be good. 
[00:07:00]  There's also the bit that got them fired.  All right.  It's right there?  I have it in the office.  Oh, nice.  That would be a great website, by the way.  The bits that got the radio guys fired dot com.  Look at this.  At this point, there's quite an impressive amount of material.  Wow, look at all this stuff.  What?  This is just a bunch of bits, and, well, they really kind of archived their stuff, too.  I bet they'd like to have this. 
[00:07:30]  Is that JV and Elvis stuff?  Yeah.  They better make two copies if they broke up.  Radio chick show, 12-18-06.  Caller yells, doghouse.  Butchie goes on rampage.  Bashes JV and Elvis.  Says crank calls should be sent to JM's office because he'd enjoy them.  How long does that bet?  Two more callers yell, doghouse.  Butchie loses it.  Says, doghouse listeners are...  And then he uses the F word for gay people that we can't say.  Oh, boy. 
[00:08:00]  Says it's an effing issue.  Calls JM a D-face.  Oh, boy.  Says, uh, Free FM is being driven into the ground.  Says he's being messed with from every angle of the building.  Leslie tells Butchie not to yell.  Uh, Black Caesar tells Butchie, or Butchie, this is what they...  They must not have liked each other.  Because he even writes on the synopsis, 
[00:08:30]  uh, Black Caesar tells Butchie, uh, Butchie, to chill out.  Butchie says JV and Elvis are lying, and they're not leaving.  Says they're like a boil on the backside.  I love inter, um, show wars, especially when they're on the same station.  Nothing more uncomfortable in the hallways.  All right.  Good stuff in there.  Might have to sort through some of that.  Yeah, find some good ones.  All right, E-Rock, maybe, uh, maybe we'll play a couple of those today. 
[00:09:00]  They didn't like each other.  Wow.  I was driving yesterday listening to Bet the Worst Of on, uh, on the, on XM, the replay,  and they were playing the, um, the Linda Blair bit.  Oh, yeah.  I laughed out loud, alone in the car.  It's so stupid.  It is so totally obnoxious.  It just gets to you.  After a minute, you can't not laugh.  It's so just, it's like, all right, already, we got it.  E-Rock, can you find that?  I mean, you can't just mention that without another replay of that.  It's a, what? 
[00:09:30]  He's getting it?  It's a quickie.  It really made me laugh, though, listening to it.  Yeah.  I don't know if I'd ever heard that.  We've been, uh, spending a little time, uh, replaying some of our uncomfortable interviewing  moments.  Yeah.  And the Linda Blair one was terrific.  It was at some weird convention.  What is it called?  Like, the, uh, the, uh, the has-been con-  Dork, dork fest?  Dork slash has-been convention.  Yeah.  And we were-  Comic-Con, right?  They do those things.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's like the mayor.  They all know him.  Yeah.  It's creepy.  Uh, it's not there, E-Rock. 
[00:10:00]  You got it?  Look at people saying this.  Ant, first order of business, Opie's Jerry Lewis telethon douche tape.  Yep.  Let me tell you, I got a preview in the office.  You did?  You imagine being early.  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy, it is, I can't even, unwatchable isn't even the word for it.  It is so hard to, I'd rather sit through a beheading than watch the, it's so incredibly 
[00:10:30]  hard to watch.  I just, I couldn't find the, uh, the tape and then I realized it was on a, uh, it was  on a demo reel because I was sending this out to TV stations.  See, George C. Scott had an easier time watching his daughter in hardcore than we had watching  Opie.  Were you embarrassed watching it?  Uh.  Oh, my God, he had to be.  I'll answer that.  Yes.  Well, I replayed it last night for my girl.  And then I get a call from Lindsay saying, please, please tell him not to bring this in. 
[00:11:00]  I, she goes, I actually considered not marrying him.  Yeah.  I, uh, I'll tell you this much.  I, uh, I played it and next thing I know, like, she picks up the phone.  I'm like, what are you doing?  And she goes, I have to talk to Anthony right now.  It's so bad.  She was like, but she's trying to bargain for her, her future husband's life.  It was like, please don't.  And then she's yelling at me as we're watching it.  She goes, what is wrong with you? 
[00:11:30]  I'm like, what?  She goes, this doesn't bother you at all.  You're just sitting there laughing.  And then she was hiding her head.  And you were laughing like it was someone else.  Yeah.  But it was you.  Well, that's what I told Anthony.  Looking at this stuff, it's like a lifetime ago.  I don't, I, I swear to you, there's a few things on this tape.  I don't remember doing, I literally don't remember doing your head embarrassed.  Like if you couldn't hide your head and it's just me and her.  And she goes, what is wrong with you?  She goes, I'm so uncomfortable.  And, uh, she's, she's the type of girl.  She's, she doesn't tell me what to do. 
[00:12:00]  You know, she understands that part of a relationship, which, which is the, if, if half the relationships  out there would understand that dumb point, you'd get along a lot better.  Yeah.  Don't tell each other what to do.  She goes, but with that, she goes, I would never tell you what to do.  Obviously, you know that by now we've been together a while, but I'm begging you, please  don't bring the tape in.  She goes, you're going to embarrass me in the end.  If you were a bottom in hardcore pornography, it wouldn't be as embarrassing as this tape. 
[00:12:30]  Is it hooked up to a TV in here or no?  Oh, they, we had the AV squad, uh, roll in a TV.  So it was like an old roll in TV and, and just, we could certainly do that like, uh, next  break.  So you can do it.  Jimmy, I can give you, I can give you just a little, uh, a little taste.  Yeah.  This is the intro to my demo reel.  Hi, I'm Opie, a starving radio personality.  I need TV work.  Call me this number right here.  Okay.  Let's check out some videotape. 
[00:13:00]  You know what?  I can't attack you for that, even though seeing it may make me change.  Oh no.  Wait till you see it.  No, it's more, I gotta say, it's more of a visual.  Yeah.  I think what's, what we're going to get out of this today is, uh, if we roll in the AV  and get, uh, Jimmy's, uh, reaction live on the show, that would be really good.  And then I guess we could throw it up on onaradio.com later today.  Oh, please.  Although I will say though, if, if you're trying to be as charming as it sounds like,  Oh, wait till you hear his exciting, uh, uh, commercial for Midway Airlines. 
[00:13:30]  Um, I've never heard such a lackluster delivery.  I was kind of out of my element on that one.  Oh, I gotta tell you, but yeah, I never wanted to do radio full time.  I wanted to be in TV.  Obviously the TV thing didn't work out.  And I used to scratch my head like, I don't, I don't know why the TV thing didn't work out.  And then just looking back at this tape, it's obvious why I'm, I'm doing radio and not TV. 
[00:14:00]  Maybe because you looked 10.  Yeah.  I looked ridiculously young and horrendous haircuts.  The hairstyle was very eighties.  Jeans pulled up almost to my belly button, but I'm assuming that was the style because  I, I, I was always following the latest trends.  And here's another thing.  I used to be like a really, really nice guy.  I used to be trying so hard to be the nice guy.  No, it wasn't even trying.  So you guys are confused because you've known me for way too long as being the dick. 
[00:14:30]  I actually was a really nice guy.  I'm telling you something about myself.  Yes.  I was brought up, uh, for the most part, the right way.  And I was a very nice guy with manners and it got me nowhere.  And, and somewhere along the line, I said, F the nice, nice guy act.  You certainly did.  And now, but you can see like the niceness in this video.  It's just nice.  Oh yeah.  You're dripping with niceness.  Dripping with niceness and dripping with something else. 
[00:15:00]  Flop sweat.  Flop sweat.  And a bit of the gay at times.  I think it's funny that you say, I was, I was the nice guy.  And then we laughed.  You go, no, I'm telling you.  That's the beauty.  You, you guys have no clue.  I used to be a heavy drinker.  I don't drink.  I haven't drank in, in years.  A little glass of wine here and there, but.  Oh, little.  So when people, so when people, you know, ah, whatever.  But.  And whatever.  Screw you all.  No. 
[00:15:30]  But the nice thing is, is the God's honest truth.  I used to be over the top nice.  I thought that was the way to go.  And I like you, um, talking down to the little muscular disc of the children.  Come on, put it in the bowl.  Oh, oh, it's horrible.  Oh, Jimmy, I can't wait to just see your eyes pop out of your head.  When you see his kajagoogoo hair cut.  I had a modified tail, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There was something going on. 
[00:16:00]  But you were almost stepping into mullet territory because the back was getting a little long.  But you were just short of it.  It was a modified, uh, yeah, sure.  Mullet.  All right, we'll get to that.  Those are the days, though.  What are you going to do?  You weren't out of touch with what was going on at the time.  I don't know.  Everybody dressed a little silly and had wacky hair back in the 80s.  I don't remember.  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  I remember a couple of those things.  You blocked it out like a childhood rape.  Dude.  When I did the commercial for the, uh, Channel 8 t-shirts. 
[00:16:30]  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Jim, wait till you see.  Wait till you see this commercial he does for Channel 8, uh, Coke, Coca-Cola t-shirts.  Yeah.  I guess they were supposed to be the hit of the summer.  Like, I guess everyone was supposed to run out and get their Channel 8 Coke t-shirts.  It, it, it.  We'll roll in the B.A.V. after the break.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Will we be able to watch it as the audience is hearing it so we can tell them if possible? 
[00:17:00]  I guess we could throw a mic, you know, on the TV so it kind of syncs up.  It won't be the greatest quality.  And then we'll throw the whole thing up on ownedayradio.com.  We'll hear enough.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's so great you found that.  Oh, is it, Jimmy?  It's not great if you, uh, live in my house.  That's funny.  I almost, I almost didn't marry.  Hey, uh, you were talking about the Linda Blair.  We got that going into break.  Ooh.  So Linda Blair, uh, calls our show. 
[00:17:30]  She's, of course, uh, the actress from The Exorcist.  Yes.  And we were, uh, going to talk to Linda Blair.  This is how it went down.  This was N.E.W. too, by the way.  Yeah, back in the day.  Not, not too long ago.  Well, probably eight years ago.  Yeah.  Seven years ago, maybe.  Here's how it went down.  And right now on the phone, it's Linda Blair.  Linda Blair.  The power of Christ compels you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Woo-hoo!  The power of Christ compels you. 
[00:18:00]  The power of Christ compels you.  The power of Christ compels you.  The power of Christ compels you.  The power of Christ compels you.  The power of Christ compels you.  The power of Christ compels you. 
[00:18:30]  The power of Christ compels you.  The power of Christ compels you.  The power of Christ compels you.  The power of Christ compels you.  The power of Christ compels you.  The power of Christ compels you.  The power of Christ compels you. 
[00:19:00]  The power of Christ compels you.  The power of Christ compels you.  The power of Christ compels you.  Linda Blair, everyone  There she is  It was so  Linda Blair  Oh, my ribs  There wasn't a hint 
[00:19:30]  Of stopping  No, no  This was going to continue until it ended  Oh, yeah  What are you going to ask Linda Blair? Come on  Let's be honest with each other  Was that pea soup?  Who cares?  It was Rick James  Did he burn you with his crack pipe?  He was really packing, though, Rick James  Yeah, that's what I hear  Boy, she loved that, huh?  That kind of makes me like her more 
[00:20:00]  So that made you laugh yesterday, Jimmy?  Yeah, just right  It was so obnoxious and stupid  It really made me laugh  It goes from kind of funny  To annoying  To really funny  To watch her lose it  Like, at first, she's trying to be good-natured  And then she's like, is this a recording?  And then she just goes, ah!  She gets all mad  I'm so mad  Good  I'm bored  I'm picturing big, stupid Kev just standing there  Not knowing what's going on the other end of the phone  Is this going well? 
[00:20:30]  She's horrified  He probably hears, like, he sees her probably listening  Thinking, ah, they're probably having some laughs  Yeah, having some laughs  The old version of me, I would have had 20 exorcist questions  Ready to roll  Oh, yeah  Ready to roll  The nice hope  Smiling  Smiling and happy  Happy to be there  Just waiting for my TV gig to come in  Let's hear it for Linda Blair  Hey, that was great, wasn't it, guys?  Hey, Linda, thanks for joining us today  Wasn't that great, guys?  Remember, Linda Blair was flown in on Midway Air 
[00:21:00]  Midway Air has a first class that's inexpensive  Hey, man  That niceness act got me nowhere  Screw being nice  Nice stinks  Nice stinks  Why didn't my dad teach me that lesson when I was growing up?  Nice stinks  Nice stinks  It got me nowhere  Except working every Christmas Eve  And every Christmas Day  And every Thanksgiving  Every New Year's Eve 
[00:21:30]  Every weekend  For years  Year after year after year  Yeah  And there I am just being nice and happy to be there  Oh, I understand  Okay, boss  Yeah, okay  Alright, whatever you say  Okay, okay  Climb the ladder and wait there  Alright, I'll climb that ladder and make a fool of myself  Okay, okay  You know, look  It was the journey that brought you here  The culmination of a career  A lifetime ago  You know, that's your responsible  That stuff is responsible for putting you on the road that brought you here 
[00:22:00]  Don't beat me up too bad  Because I found every episode of Real Rock TV last night as well, my friend  Ew  Whoa  And those are going to start showing up as early as next week  Those are a little, um  Wacky  Wacky is right  Wow  Alright, we've got to take a quick break  And we're going to roll in the AV equipment for Jimmy  Oh, yeah  Alright, we'll do that next  He's got to say it  What's wrong, Jimmy?  A little teaser? 
[00:22:30]  Oh, the pace thing?  No, no, no  Just looking at this, uh  This preppy killer  19 years  Just the amount of time  19 years for the drug thing  More years than killing a person  In the end  I think it was, uh, you know  Kind of breaking his, uh  Conditions of parole  Yeah, I know  Oh, yeah  I don't feel bad for him  I'm only saying  Oh, I know  It's gone  It's amazing how you can leave drugs  Just  What an idiot  He got out  He killed somebody  He gets out  He's still relatively young  And he just 
[00:23:00]  He was one of the lucky ones  You  Most people, they kill somebody  They're not getting out anytime soon  Yeah  He was able to get out  And he was still a younger man  Relatively young guy  What was he?  Like in his late 30s?  Maybe early 40s?  I want to say  He did  Oh, wait  He's like 40  41 now  He's probably like 36  Yeah, he was out for about three years maybe  Oh, he made it  Oh, okay  He would have got out earlier, I think  If he had just been better behaved in prison, too  Yeah, he was awful  Always getting caught with drugs in prison  So he looks out and gets a second chance at this thing 
[00:23:30]  And he's still young  He's got his whole life ahead of him  And he blows it  Now he's in for another  I think prison really must have screwed him up  And now he's in for another 19 years  And it doesn't look like they're going to do the old parole thing anytime soon  I bet he got tagged  Yeah  I bet  Preppy killer kills that girl  Gets in prison  He's just some young, good-looking guy  Oh, I bet some of the sisters got a hold  To him  He probably would have done 10 or 11 years maximum  If he had been 
[00:24:00]  If he had just not been such a dick in jail  And he's fought a lot in jail  And he also would always get caught with drugs and problems  I think they kept refusing his parole  I'd like to say  The Preppy killer was able to fight off the sisters  I just saw the end of that recently  The best part of that whole thing with the sisters  Is when the head guy  The head sister  Whatever it is  Is in the shower  Is like  Hard to get  I like that  And starts soaping himself up 
[00:24:30]  Looking dreamily into the water  Oh, God  I don't remember that  Now you're gonna open your mouth  And you're gonna take what I give you  Oh, just horrible  These are the worst prison rapists  Like in Escape from Alcatraz  They had that big fat wolf  Oh, yeah  I'm looking for a new punk  And he couldn't have been less scary looking  No  He's a fat guy with a big chest  He's a big fat douche  Why is everyone scared of you? 
[00:25:00]  You're just a fat man  Clint beat him up  He certainly did  And Clint's line was so awful  Clint goes  Why don't you show me what you got?  Really?  It was so bad  His come on line  Like he was acting like he was in a kiss wolf  Yeah  In the shower  And then he was like a 1950s gut punch  It was so awful  But Clint's stupid smile  Why don't you show me what you got?  Show me what you got  How'd the other guy buy that?  Yeah  Awful  I didn't think he was getting some  We gotta take a break here 
[00:25:30]  Alright  Just when it was getting sexy  I know  877-212-ONDA  Opie Anthony Jim Norton  And now this  A big good morning to everybody  It's the Opie and Anthony show  I see they rolled in  An old school TV  This thing is  It's got a VCR on top 
[00:26:00]  Built in  Built in  This must have been all the rage back in  Nineteen  Eighty  I'm trying to listen to my new Robert Palmer tape  But my supposed fiance  Keeps buzzing in my ear  Technology has come a long way  Why would you want the VCR on the TV?  Because if the VCR breaks  They gotta go in and fix your whole TV  It's just a nightmare  That was always the thing  It's like  Why would you do that? 
[00:26:30]  What's the biggie  About having a VCR  Somewhere else  That isn't in your TV  That way  Yeah  One breaks  Convenient entertainment  Right there  Oh what's his VCR?  You're right  Combination  Convenient entertainment  I stand corrected  Well  More importantly  Why is this TV still at this studio?  Because they don't throw anything away  How about they spend some money?  On what?  A VCR?  On anything  How about this place spends money on anything? 
[00:27:00]  Do they sell VCRs anymore?  You'll always be able to get them for old tapes  You'll always be able to get them  Yeah  Because the old tapes people find  Yeah it's something that's always going to be needed  But they're like 60 bucks, 70 bucks  It's like an 8-track player  You ain't going to find an 8-track player  And that's something like  That just went away  Completely  Eventually  You're not going to be able to find a VCR  Yeah eventually  It's just going to be done  You can't  Go to a store and try to find an old floppy disk drive  First of all 
[00:27:30]  I don't think  I don't think the Best Buys and the Circuit Cities  I hate when people do that  So why did I do that?  The Best Buys  The Best Buys and the Circuit Cities  There's only one Best Buy  And there's only one  I love that  The Barry Bonds  You know  It's the people like the Derek Jeters  The Derek Jeters  What?  There's one Derek Jeter  I did it though  I don't think they sell VCRs  Probably not  I just think you'll always be able to get them  But I could be completely wrong  I don't know why I'm on the VCR  You're really  Oh keep making them  Yeah 
[00:28:00]  There's a demand  Why don't I just shut up so we can play this  Hey Stephen S. from Bayshore  Now Tom Chiasano retired  Quote retired  A year ago at this point  Wow no way  I don't know  It's got to be a while  Not a year dude  Not a year  No way it's a year  Maybe eight months ago  It was like a week  About eight months ago  And Stephen S. from Bayshore  Still beating up Tom Chiasano  That's the TV Tom Chiasano used to watch his copies of animal porn  Animal porn huh? 
[00:28:30]  Yeah  Oh god  Should we get this rolling?  I say we should  He goes deep down  He was a naughty boy  Yeah  Alright so if you're just tuning in  I teased this tape yesterday  Because the Jerry Lewis telethon was on yesterday  And I reminded the boys that back in the day  When I used to be a really nice person  I actually volunteered my time  Yes  And I did some local TV for the Jerry Lewis telethon  Oh you certainly did  I also was part of the Big Brother program in Rye 
[00:29:00]  You were so involved with nice guy stuff  I was dripping with niceness  Yes  And I realized probably a little too late  That nice stinks  Nice doesn't get you anywhere  And I changed my tune  To the wonderful person you hear every morning  Let's just watch this fabulous tape  So well hold on  So then I went searching for the tape  And boy it's better than we thought yesterday  Not only did I find the Jerry Lewis telethon stuff 
[00:29:30]  I found a demo tape  That I thought I was going to be sending  Probably to MTV  Probably to all the big TV outlets across America  And they're going to go  I'm going to make him a star  That's right  Greg Hughes the nice guy  Was going to be discovered  And then he was going to become a big TV star  Years later I'm doing what I should be doing  Radio  As a dick  That's what we should all be doing  It's great  Is it? 
[00:30:00]  Yeah  Is it?  Sure  Radio's good man  You don't have to  If the TV  They become obsessed  With looks and all that  The radio's great  You just do five hours  Yeah rolling  Who cares  We're doing five  Three to five hours a day  But I was going to parlay  My early radio jobs  Into a big TV gig  That's the point I'm making here  But I said goodbye to the nice guy  And that's that  These guys don't have any clue  Of the nice version 
[00:30:30]  That's what I love  Hope he's trying his best  To preface what you're going to see  I heard the charming part  But he goes  Hi I'm Opie  I have a charming part  Alright well  Hi  Wait till you see it  This is  The visual  Is fantastic  I guess this is a little compilation  Of what Opie did  Over  How long of a period of time is this?  I don't know  Maybe  I don't know  Probably a year  To maybe two years of stuff  A year to maybe two years 
[00:31:00]  Of TV stuff  And if you're in TV  Or even radio  You compile  Your work  You put it on a tape  And that way you can send it out  Like Opie said  So this is what  Amounts to a compilation  And he kind of  Intros it  As that  And this is also  What I thought was  The best of the best  The best of the best  I'd love to see  What you threw out  What didn't make the tape  Probably nothing  So I think she's very  Alright here we go  Here it is Jimmy  Oh jeez  Get ready 
[00:31:30]  Hi I'm Opie  A starving radio personality  I need TV work  Call me  This number right here  Okay  Let's check out some  Video tape  Ah  Push pause  He just goes  Push pause  He just goes  Ah  Jimmy  What's wrong Jimmy  It wasn't bad  Because it was like  Ah you're young  And whatever  You're trying to make  An impression  You were a handsome dude  I mean you know  Whatever  Yeah I know  But you're pointing down

[00:54:30]  Oh I got  Believe me  I got some  Dude she moments  We've been at this for 14 years  We've been waiting for  You to take the lead  And maybe show us  A couple of your clips  What's the ballad called?  God I can't even remember the name  Hold on  Pendulum  I'll remember it  Do you remember any of them  At like  One linesman  I would have to  I would have to hear it  Oh okay  Yeah  No I can't even remember the  Alright  The hook  Watch it be a song 
[00:55:00]  That actually turned out to be a hit  That was stolen from Anthony  Listen to this  It's so silly  Once  Twice  Three times  Something Matt Davis stole  Right  Tony Orlando made it into a hit  Oh it's horrific  And I know it  It's just awful  80s  Try to be  Wannabe 80s  Power ballad  Yeah  How about you get it for the show  Yeah  Can I say something about Tony Orlando  All kidding aside  He's in the paper today  Oh is he  He's tying another yellow ribbon 
[00:55:30]  Around the old oak tree  Is he  I'm sure even Tony Orlando  Is sick of tying yellow ribbons  Around trees  At this point  I think he wants to tie one around his neck  Yeah  I think he wants to hang from a yellow ribbon  From an oak tree  Can I tell you that son of a bitch though  Can really rock out a tune  Who wouldn't go see Tony Orlando live  Can do you  Oh we can make it together  Knock three times  Is fantastic  I like twice on a pipe  I despise the pipe sound 
[00:56:00]  Clink clink  Ding ding  That's if the answer is no  So you won't have to hear it  The answer is yes  Yeah but yeah  But knock three times  It claps I think  It's some dumb knock sound  Yeah  Why  The hell's that  Just come to the door  And say yeah or no  What a creep  Hacking notes by our window  Ribbons around trees  It's like secret agent  I cut your rabbit's throat  And I put it in the stew  All right  Lovely  Aren't you  Yeah  Stalking's only like romantic in a song  Yeah exactly 
[00:56:30]  You know  I killed your fiance  Oh that's sweet  You make a good point  I tied a hundred yellow ribbons around the oak trees at the end  At the end of the song he does that  No she does  Oh she does it  He's on the bus  All right  He's annoying everyone  He's going  Because he's like  I'll stay on the bus  Forget about us  That's the whole reason he put the bus in that song  And the whole damn town is cheering  No the whole damn bus is cheering  Oh the bus  Yes because that means 
[00:57:00]  That douche is getting off  That's why they're cheering  They see ribbons  And they're like  He's getting off  The bus should have been cheering  Like they were in Canada  When that one guy  Chopped the other guy's head off  Well that should be a bus in Tel Aviv  If the wrong religious fanatic gets on  What a yutz  Why not just  Why would you say  Tie a yellow  Why a big stupid bright ribbon around a tree  Why not just  Yes or no  Right back  Hey miss ya 
[00:57:30]  Why do we all have to be involved in this  Right why  Why don't you chop the tree down  Let it fall on the bus  And paralyze me  He's in the paper today though  With that yellow ribbon crap  You really do huh  Oh yeah I really  I would go see him  I don't know what's wrong with the newspapers  And local TV  But they're all reporting today  That Don LaFontaine died  The inner world guy  Yeah  But this story we had yesterday  Yeah and he wound up dying  Like a few days before that  Sure  What's wrong 
[00:58:00]  They're way behind on this one  The inner world guy  Yeah  Hey you guys watching the convention  Jerry Reed's dead too  Jerry Reed from Smokey and the Bandit  Smokey and the Bandit  And wasn't he a country singer back in the day  Oh yeah  He had plenty of awful  Never really  Hokey songs  Did he ever  Did he ever make it as a country singer  Yeah he had a couple  Of hits  He had um  He had that song about a girl  That left  Amos Moses  Amos Moses was one  That was his first biggie  And then there was  You don't remember Amos Moses 
[00:58:30]  And then Eastbound and Down  Oh this is Jerry Reed singing this  Yeah  I didn't know that  Really  I really did  Oh yeah yeah  We gon' do  They say can be done  Yeah  He had that hair  Yeah  Fred  Hold on to your ass Fred  Come on Fred  Jerry Reed was great though  When he backs over all those motors  How do you not like this  He's all beat up  And when you're hot  You're hot  Was a big hit  When you're hot  You're hot  Remember that one  You're not  How about that  That's when he goes before the judge 
[00:59:00]  Yeah  See that was I think his biggest hit  When you're hot  You're hot  Listen to it  It's so awful  See this is the difference between you and I  You were stuck in front of a TV watching this stuff  And I was too busy going to the local Rochester parlor to get my hair  My hair did for my next big TV  My hair did  No this was back in I think when I was out in California  You know very equestrian  And my father always had the country station on  So I used to listen to this garbage  You got when you're hot  You're hot  That was a crossover hit actually 
[00:59:30]  Oh it certainly was  Yeah  Yeah  Big time on the pop charts  That one and Amos Moses  Yeah  For some reason  That was just a weird one  This is  When you're hot you're hot  A crossover hit  Yeah  This had a whole story  Oh yeah this is like a story  I don't know this  Well now me and Homer Jones  And Bigger  The late  I never heard this  What  And I kept rolling M7  No you know this  You'll know the chorus  My luck was so good  I could do no wrong  Jerry Reed dead 
[01:00:00]  Of Emphysema  71  When you're hot  You're hot  I do yeah  When you're hot you're hot  And when you're not you're not  Remember this  Sort of  I sort of remember this  When you're hot you're hot  La la la la la la  How bad is this  When you're hot you're hot  Well now every time I rolled them dice I'd win  And I was just getting ready to roll them again 
[01:00:30]  When I heard something behind me  This stinks  It's horrible  This was a hit  You're trying to tell me this was a hit  Yeah this is a hit back in like the mid 70s I think  Alright  Around there  Well  Now Eastbound and Down is a good song  Yeah  Of course  You don't like this  La la la la la  That's the only part I do like  It sounds like you're just making fun of a car to people for no reason  La la la la la la  La la la la la  Play for burn victims  When you're hot you're hot 
[01:01:00]  When you're hot you're hot  Well  Why  I don't know  I couldn't believe I  The judge was a fishing buddy  Did I recognize  I said hey judge  Old buddy old pal  See he gives a little story  He was gambling  He gets arrested  He goes before a judge  The judge is your friend  But  That's wonderful  But are we going to do this all day  No  He's talk singing  This is one of those  Alice's restaurant  Just about yeah  Just keeps going and going and going  He let my friends go free  And throwed the book at me  He throwed the book at me 
[01:01:30]  Someone's saying that  Well Kurt of Missouri writes  Reed's best song  She got the gold mine  I got the shaft  Oh  No clue  I don't know exactly what that means  Why is this song still playing  Why  Why  It's the whole damn song  That was it  Yeah  Did we listen to the whole song  We were going to just like mention that the guy from Smoking the Bandit died  It's our tribute to  Ten minutes on Jerry Reed  Jerry Reed tribute right there  I think we gave him the biggest tribute anybody in radio is going to give him  Sure 
[01:02:00]  Well I think we should have had some Smoking the Bandit three clips ready  Because the first one was a funny movie  Yep  The second one had a couple of moments but was basically douchey  Yeah  Three  Wasn't it starring Jerry Reed because they couldn't get the big guy  Yeah  So they dressed him like Burt Reynolds like the bandit  Yeah  And he drove around in the Trans Am  Yeah  Like he was the star but he was  Dressed like Burt Reynolds  Snowman  You finally  Snowman  You finally got his opportunity 
[01:02:30]  Yeah  That was his big break  Can we get some of those clips possibly  Oh it's so bad  Camera crew must have been like  This is  Especially the first one was  It's a comedy class  Yeah  Yeah  Because Gleason is  Is just so great  Yep  And  Three is so bad  And Burt Reynolds  Back then his laugh was charming  Now you're like  Shut up wig  Yeah we get it  You got a funny silly laugh  And a great pro feel  That stupid thing on your head 
[01:03:00]  I kind of like  Cut my toilet seat with that wig  I kind of like the Dom DeLuise outtakes back in the day  Oh Jesus  At the end of the movie  All the outtakes  Yeah  Yeah that was a special little thing they threw at us  Like him running naked through a hotel chasing a busboy  Oh that was when they left out  From the personal collection  Yeah  Alright we're going to take a break  Rich Voss is going to join the program  Ooh  Maybe we'll give her some thoughts on the Republican National Convention  Yeah 
[01:03:30]  This Palin is going to be talking tonight  She's on stage right now  Kind of checking out the stage  Getting a feel for it  Oh is that it?  It says a lot  She's got to pick the right clothing  Is that live live?  Well it's got to be  She's checking it out  She's working out her speech  She is pretty sexy dude  Considering she could be the vice president  She has nice kissable lips  She is not bad at all  You could send her out to the foreign dignitaries  And just you know  Yeah  Pimp her out a little bit  A mini skirt  Yeah  Come on honey  Show a little leg  A little lace 
[01:04:00]  It's a big night for her man  She could blow this whole thing tonight  Really?  I think so  That'll get some votes  Oh you mean  Oh okay  You mean screw it up  Alright sorry  That's right  God I get so confused  That's right  She's a broad  And we don't respect her  Jeez  We think she's just going to be  You know what  And everybody  It is amazing  That she took the heat  They took the focus off Obama  Yeah  Yeah totally  After 80 something  I'm like there's nothing they can do 
[01:04:30]  That are going to make people look at them  Yeah  And all of a sudden  She's all they're talking about  Her and that wreck of a kid  You know having a baby at 17  You know what I mean  It's like  Wow that really wasn't  I was talking to someone yesterday  And they said  This  This  This  This  Palin has something for everyone  A little white trash  A little  A little  Special needs  Yeah  Yeah  Because she's got the kid  With the  You know  Disability  The unwanted pregnancy  With the daughter  The daughter  She's got real problems  That  That parents face 
[01:05:00]  On a daily basis  She does the gun  And hunting thing  For those people  That's  That's my people  Yeah well  She's got a little of everything  For everybody  That's what somebody  Was saying yesterday  I'm like uh oh  Uh oh  She definitely has the  I'd like to see the glasses  Come off  And the hair come down  Damn  She doesn't look nervous  And see what she looks like  No that's one thing  When she gave the initial speech  She wasn't nervous or anything  So  I don't know why people  Don't listen to us man  We  We  We  Know what's going on  Could be 
[01:05:30]  We're idiots  Yeah but  But between all this  If this  Between all this crap  If you listen closely  We're highly clever  And intelligent  With our thoughts  Imagine tonight  This  This  This broad  Yeah  Now you have to look  Between the broad comment  If also in the middle  Of her speech  Like you were just saying  She slowly takes her glasses off  Takes the  Takes the thing out  What do they call those things  In the  With the hair  Yeah the hair thing  And then  And then the music  Just turns to some  Like kind of like 
[01:06:00]  Some saxophone  And then she just does  The slow motion  Like the Adam Ant video  Yeah  Yeah  With the hair  Landslide victory  For John McCain  Yeah  Doesn't matter what  She's saying or doing  This country would  Fall in love with her  I think tomorrow  We're going to be talking  About her awful voice  A lot  She got a  High  Kind of  Gravelly  Screechy voice  It's a little annoying  A little  A little  That Fargo  In her voice too  A little Fargo  She's got a little bit  Up in the tundra

[01:07:00]  Helen looked  Nothing like her  No  I just picture  With the glasses  And her hair  Is always up  In that  Beehive  I'm kind of  With Jimmy  She looks really  Like  She looks really  Pretty there  She looks doable  On TV  Are there older  Pictures of her  When she was  A beauty contest  Oh she was  She got better  Looking as  She got older  Did she  I think  She looked horrendous  When she was younger  Really  I think  I think  I think  She's a makeover  For the Republican party  What she is  Is she's making them  A little bit younger  Even if they don't win  She has a future  Yeah  It's like 
[01:07:30]  They're considered  Just a bunch of  People look at them  And they go  Ah same old thing  Old white guy  And she's just  A new look  This is the first time  Since 1972  That the Republicans  Have not had a Bush  Or a Bob Dole  Involved in any election  They do have a Bush  Involved  Oh my bad  Yeah we're throwing you  Stuff right  Yeah  Thank you  72  Slow lob  Something else  She should do  In her private time  But she knows  The photographers  Are following her  But she can make believe

[01:10:30]  Where are you going to be Rich  In Dick  In Dick's  Beantown Comedy  Escape  At the Crown Plaza Hotel  In Worcester Massachusetts  Okay  That's all I wanted to do  Was make him improperly  Pronounce the name of that town  Whatever  What's the big deal  All they know is  Dick's Beantown Comedy  Shape  I'm back in Worcester  Where we did the tour  Two years ago  Jesus  And uh  Nobody knows where Worcester is  Worcester  Rich  It doesn't exist  You're saying the town name wrong 
[01:11:00]  You know  Oh I am  W-O-R  Alright say it again  Worcester  Yeah  Alright  Whatever  They like to call Worcester up there  Oh Worcester  Worcester  Take the R out  The R is silent  Well that was  Take the R out  That was half your problem  It was  Tickets  1-800-401-2221  September 5th  That's this weekend right  Yeah this weekend  That's going to be great  It's going to be a good show  Listen I'm not you know  Hey  I'm a comic  I like to work  And it's going to be a good weekend 
[01:11:30]  That's all that matters  Oh he was trashing my career  No I was not trashing your career  I just wanted to hear you say the town name wrong  Of course  Worcester  Worcester  Worcester  I'll say it  Worcester  Worcester  Worcester  What do you think of Palin  Yeah  Being picked  I mean you're more Republican right  Yeah  I'm more  Yeah well no  I'm just level headed  You know what  Frankenstein  Yeah what do you got  What do you got on the Republican  What gets me is 
[01:12:00]  Obama's comparing himself to her  He's not running against her  He's running against McCain  You know he's trashing her  But you know what  She's vice president  Running you know  Pick for vice presidency  You know what  I think she's just an American broad  You know  You know what I'm saying  She's got kids  She  Everything she's done  She's done it well  And she's accomplished  And  You know  Finished  She went from one thing  To the next 
[01:12:30]  And she has accomplishments  Do you understand what I'm saying  Mayor  What's her  Councilwoman  Councilwoman  Mayor  Governor  Alright  She took her  Her state  That was in a deficit  And now  She has  Their plus  Would they sell snow  Their plus  Now they have  A plus  Now they have the plus  I think she said  The plus  The plus  And now they have the plus  Holy moly  Now they're in the 
[01:13:00]  Whatever  We're in a deficit  Now they have the plus  Jimmy and I  We're on the same page there  We're just like  Let them talk  Because you just  Watch the wheels  Start falling off  You always start off good boss  You really do  And then you look around  The room for help  And we're not here  To help you anymore  Anymore  Ever  You're good for the first  15 to 20 seconds  Discussing anything  Really  It's like wow  Alright  And then it's a runaway train  You don't know  You don't know  Where it's going to crash  Heading for that curve  A little too fast 
[01:13:30]  This time it ended  And she's now in the plus  The plus  She had a deficit  And now she has the plus  That's because Rich  Is never like  Growing up  Never went beyond 20 seconds  He would try to talk  Yeah  He would go  Shut up  That's  Yeah  I think you're right  He is attacking her more  That was a smart move  She scares me a little bit  She scares me a little bit  Well you know  And they're against her  Because one of the things  That they're against  Is because her daughter  Who's pregnant  They would love to see  Her daughter have an abortion 
[01:14:00]  Because you know  Being that they're all  Pro-choice  But the mom is making  The daughter have the baby  Well it's a little weird  For a Republican candidate  To have a daughter  That's going to have a kid  Out of wedlock  You know what  She should ask  That kind of goes against  The values of most Republicans  She should ask Father Frank  If the Pope will give  Special dispensation  For an abortion  When they're at the disco maybe  I'm with you  I'm right there with you  She loves to taste 
[01:14:30]  The communion wafers  I'm with you  A little Saturday night fever  Boss  Just to bring you on board  Father Frank  He'll go back to the church  He'll go back  You know Jerry Springer  Made a great point  On our show yesterday  When he was just babbling  About that  America's Got Talent show  Which was terrific  Last night by the way  Had to say that  So Springer will call back  He said that  We decide who the  The nomination for  President is going to be  And then  And then all of a sudden  They just pick a VP  That can very easily  Be a president 
[01:15:00]  Be the president  If anything happens  Should we be involved  In that process too  As Americans  Because if something  Happens to the president  The vice president  Takes over  And now there's somebody  That the American people  Had no choice  In picking  I'd never heard that  Said before  And Springer brought it up  I'm like wow  You know you make  A great point  A real odd case  Is that Gerald Ford  Because you know  Spiro Agnew  Resigned  From little text problems  He stepped in  And Gerald Ford 
[01:15:30]  Stepped in  As vice president  And then when Nixon  Had to resign  There's a guy  That was never  Voted in  To anything  And he's the president  Yeah people forget  No one voted for  Ford officially  To be president  Of the United States  Of America  There he was  Johnson took over  After  Yeah  Yeah  Ask me who goes  After the vice president  If they're taken out  Alright  Here we go  Speaker of the house  No that's actually  Not true  Oh really  No it is true  But I just  I knew you had 
[01:16:00]  No faith in it  We've got a  We've got a couple  Shots of  Abroad being  A president  In the near future  I mean McCain's  Face is  Looks like it's  Swelling in front  Of our eyes  There's something  Going on with that  Cheek  Couple shots  Yeah  He's falling apart  Like at the end  Of the Terminator  Where the skeletons  Just walking  McCain's little  Bits and pieces  Falling off  He looked into  The arc  Either way  We're gonna have  Either a woman  In the White House  Or African American 
[01:16:30]  That's right Rich  That's right  Someone's been  Doing some of that  Reading  That's what I'm  Saying  Yeah well  Which is weird  Well not necessarily  In the White House  It's a little bizarre  You know  We're gonna have a  Woman in the White House  She'll visit a few times  If McCain  She'll go there  To scrub the toilets  For McCain  You need some help  What do you need  Clean up  When you're done  Rattling those pots  And pans  Get in the bedroom  No she'll be  She'll be a part of it  Look  George Bush  It's amazing  How the Vice President  Like Quayle was painted 
[01:17:00]  As a dummy  Like Bush Senior  Was painted as a wimp  A wimp  Remember that one  With Reagan  For eight years  He ran the CIA  At one point  Yeah he'd be a wimp  He was so much more  Of a mother effort  Than Reagan probably was  Yeah  He painted as a big sissy  For all those years  Ah he's not tough  Fighter pilot  And then  Yeah he  It's called a wimp  They went in there  And invaded Iraq  I know it's an old joke  But last night  They did a little 
[01:17:30]  Montage video  For Bush Senior  And they were showing  Barbara Bush  And this has been said  A million times  But it's amazing  That she has an age  She was really  She was always old looking  She looked really old  20 years ago  And they had her  Sitting next to  The former president  Looking almost the same  Cotton candy head  Almost the same  As when she was  In office with  With her husband  Still wearing those pearls  Oh yeah  All the time  Same exact dress  And everything  She's a cartoon character  Bizarre  They never change  They just wear the same stuff 
[01:18:00]  Big head of whatever  That is spun wool  I hate politics  But I'm loving it  I want to shear her  And make a sweater  From her hair  Yeah  Loving it  I can't wait to see  This Palin speech tonight  We went to a war  Or Palin  I don't know  I'm still hearing it  Both ways there  I think it's Paline  Is she speaking tonight  Or Giuliani's closing out  Right  Giuliani  I gotta tell you  We're trying  We can't do justice  To this unfortunately 
[01:18:30]  We tried  And you know  We don't throw everything  On the air  Even though it sounds  Like that  If you're listening  But I was watching  Hannity and Combs  Last night  And of course  Combs is the big  Democrat right  Yeah  And he's at the  Republican National Convention  And he's doing the  You know  That show really should be  Sean Hannity's  I don't know why  They still team up  Nothing against Alan  But you know  Sean Hannity's  Such a strong  You know  Personality  He doesn't really  Needed the Alan Combs  But I guess  They're trying to do  That balance thing  And Alan Combs  Was just getting 
[01:19:00]  Just beat up  By every guest  They brought on  Because they're all  Heavy duty Republicans  At one point  Giuliani's laughing  At Alan Combs  Just openly laughing  Laughing at him  As Alan Combs  Is trying to make  His points  About John McCain's  Weaknesses and stuff  Trying to make  A point here  And Giuliani's  Just laughing  And then  John Voight was on  And he's just  Beating up Alan Combs  I thought there was  Going to be a fist fight  And John Voight's  Getting a little  Too involved  What is he about  Shut up  Exactly  Why are they  I don't know  But he's like  Parading him around  Yeah they're really  Parading him around  What's that about 
[01:19:30]  Stunt  He's  SB  Let's call him SB  He  He suddenly got involved  Because he's a  Conservative  And he wanted to  Speak about  Especially Obama's  History  With some really  Strange characters  When he was growing up  This guy that actually  Tried to bomb  The government offices  This crazy man  Whose papers  Yeah he founded  The Weathermen  And they've been  Sitting on his  Paperwork for years  Wait Voss  Know something about this  Yeah this guy  Wait wait wait  Voss  What do you got on that  Well when  He's been on committees 
[01:20:00]  With  William Ayers  William Ayers  He was the leader  Of the Weathermen  He's not helping me  I know this  Which was a radical group  A radical group  In the early 60s  And they bond  A couple of  Municipal buildings  Municipal  Okay  Full of municipal buildings  What is one of those buildings  A municipal building  Give us an example  Of one of those buildings  Holy Jesus  The Pentagon  Municipal building  A police  You know the state 
[01:20:30]  Municipal building  What's the big deal  But I'm  So he has  Ties with them now  Terror group  And the guy  And he's never denounced  William Ayers  And William Ayers  Has never apologized  For what he's done  So you know  Did he kill anybody  Or no  I don't know  If anyone died  I don't know  I'm not gonna lie  I don't know  See  You know  It takes a smart person  To say I don't know  No it takes an idiot  To not know  Did he kill anybody 
[01:21:00]  I don't know  You don't know  I don't know  So here's  His reverend  That they're all  Bringing up  That he stayed  In that church  For 20 years  And the reverend  Baptized his child  And you know  He just has  He has a long list  Of undesirables  They all do though  That  I mean  It's like whether  You trash him  That's fine  But every politician  Has disgusting  Friends and connections  They're all terrible  Wait wait wait  This guy actually said  In 2001  That he was responsible  Or involved with  30 bombings  In this country 
[01:21:30]  And he didn't regret it  In fact he said  We didn't do enough  And he was  Holding parties  It's a go-getter  Yes me  For Obama  When Obama got started  And now Obama's  Distancing himself  From that  And denying it  And the guy's  A professor  At University of  Illinois Chicago  Of course he is  He's a big time guy  And also too  In one of Obama's  Commercials  He has a picture  Of himself  As an 8 year old child  Saying  Republicans are trying  To tie me  With William Ayers  But they're not  When he was 8 years old  They're saying now  That's just like  If McCain was 
[01:22:00]  Having dinner  Or hanging out  With Tom Metzger  The leader of the Klan  People would bring this up  On my vote  Huh?  What?  Calm down  Please  They don't like dagos either  So here's the thing  They don't  What so than Jews  Oh wow  They like me a little more  Big deal  No  They hate you a lot more  Yeah  But  That's because  We're a threat  They're not  That's the reason  That we're number one  On the white supremacy list  Basically Anthony  They would look at  As just a swarthy mongrel  Right  Who was not worthy  Of sitting at their table 
[01:22:30]  Who they'd probably  Like to knock his teeth out  But they probably  Wouldn't lynch him  Yeah  You on the other hand  They would look at us  As we own the table  And they would be upset  About it  Because we're  No  The reason  That we're number one  No I think it's the whole  Religious thing  They don't really like  The whole messiah  Christian  Do you really think  That white supremacists  Care about their religion  They don't care about that  Do you think  They care  About  Now  What  No  Do you think  The Aryan Brotherhood  Or the SS  Or any of these groups  Care about religion now  No  Well that's why 
[01:23:00]  The initial hatred  Of Jews  Yeah  That's the beginning  That's where it started  So what is it now  Why do they hate Jews now  Because they think  We control everything  We control the media  Or we control the country  Or we run the country  If 3% of us  Do run the country  Then you know what  Take a look at yourselves  We're pretty smart  If 3% of us  Run the country  Or the world  Okay  The wasps run the country  But we get blamed for it  Because it's easy  To point the finger  At a minority  We don't say the country  We say the banks  And the media  Oh we run the banks 
[01:23:30]  Really  The wasps don't run the banks  The Jews couldn't work  In Chase Manhattan Bank  Until the 80s  Okay we don't run the banks  Happened  Yeah why  Why not  Because  Because they were stealing  So you know it's easy  When they were  During the 80s  When banks were foreclosing  On farms throughout the country  Because they weren't making money  Or they weren't making mortgages  Or whatever  And the banks were closing on them  These farmers  Or the propagandists  Of the white supremacists 
[01:24:00]  In the Midwest or the South  Who are we going to blame  Who are we going to point your finger at  Well the Jewish bankers  Are closing our farms  Oh  So that's  That was the attack  On the Jewish bankers  That were foreclosing  On farms  Well okay  You know  Read a little  You're right  Yeah  Can you check that book out  In a municipal building  Yeah  So  That's your advice  Read a little  Okay  We run the entertainment business  Okay say we do  Big deal  Who runs the construction business  Who runs the car business 
[01:24:30]  It's a capitalistic society  Here's the point  You're probably right  But I never had a bad audition  For a construction business  It is only your people  That have looked at me  And said  Thank you  Oh you think it's only our people  That look at you like that  Everybody  I'm saying my audition  It doesn't matter  About the audition  You know what  It's a capitalistic society  And we  This is the business  We have chosen  And we expanded it  Excuse me  For a second there  It sounded like  Let me just  I can't look at him  Because it sounded like  He said this is the business  We have chosen  Which would be 
[01:25:00]  A Hyman Roth line  Yes  And if I find out  This is the business  We have chosen  If I heard that right  I'm going to order hot coffee  And throw it on you  If you just quoted  Hyman Roth  Let's go to  Real conversation  I got to get Corey on  From North Carolina  Corey go ahead  Yeah I can't figure out  Whether I'm listening to O&A  Or meet the press  Holy Jesus  Wow what  Oh wow  Wait  Channel 11 is doing  Some hard hitting news  By having girls  In little friggin  Lingerie  Well you know what 
[01:25:30]  Ant that's the business  She has chosen  As you said that  Your head should have  Blown off  Like the scanners  I didn't know we were  I didn't know  I didn't know  We were still watching  Channel 11  Oh yeah  Of course  Very informative  News program  This is the news channel  We have chosen  That's right  I'm obsessed  Why  Because you said that  I came out naturally  I don't care  Exactly  Well you know  I always say  Keep your friends close  And retards close  Here's the thing 
[01:26:00]  Here's the thing again  Here's the thing  When I make a valid point  You don't sit there  And go  You know what  He's right about that  You want to attack  Okay  I was listening to  Everything you said  Not disagreeing with you  I was agreeing with you  Okay  No one knows you're agreeing  Just because you open your eyes  Like you're overacting  You just say yes  You're right  What are you the defender  Of the faith all of a sudden  Anyway  I'm not the defender  He always has  Has he  Yeah he's always had this in him  You might be the most  Intelligent person  Walking the earth today  We just need a translator 
[01:26:30]  To figure it out  Because like every other word  Is like intelligent  Every other word  It's weird  Like every other word  Is like kind of intelligent  And it's like a  Bunch of  Mishmash in there  141 IQ baby  Yeah alright  You don't  We proved that  No we didn't  I want to do the IQ test  I want to know  Metric conversion of that one  Why don't we do  An official IQ test  Can't possibly  I'll do that in a second  Do we have an IQ test  Well not today  Not today  I didn't sleep  Why  Because I got three hours  Sleep last time

[01:45:00]  We've been waiting for this  Rich Voss to come out  For eight years  Don't  Quite impressed Rich  I apologize  Good for you at the theater  I'm not going to say  Now when is this day  At the theater  Because I might be opened  It's the Wilbur Theater  In Boston  It's October 10th  Alright  No but I apologize  Rich I'm not going to say  Anything ill towards you  Or even joking  Like we were friends  No no  I'm not going to joke  Like we're friends  We're acquaintance  If we were friends  You would have got  An invitation to my wedding  We're acquaintance  But here's the thing  You were going to pause  For more laughter on that  Or are you going to continue 
[01:45:30]  No I was going to take a sip  See like that  That's funny  There you go  That's good  That was a good little ad  That's funny  You're going to fucking  I'm sorry  I'm surprised  That was actually  The first one  No  He had one  Are you going to edit  Every one of my jokes  About you  No no no  Every time I'm on the show  No because we know them  Because we've heard your CD  So those are the jokes  We're going to hear anyhow  Have you heard my CD  Thank you so much  It's available on iTunes  No I haven't heard your CD  I hate music acts  Mike 
[01:46:00]  I really don't care  Listen to me  Good luck in your career  And I'm sorry  If I came off a little strong  But that's how it is  Alright  I'll shut up and go to Luna Lounge  Luna Lounge  Luna Lounge closed seven years ago  It was three I thought  I'll say I didn't know  I honestly didn't know  There was real tag  I didn't know either  I didn't see that moment  I was backstage  When Mike said that  Well it's not that  It's just little things  He comes  You know what it is  Like I said  And that was  You know what  He probably  During that moment  He probably  He went after Billy  He went after you too 
[01:46:30]  Okay  No I didn't  No I actually didn't  I said  To get people  To applaud  I said  Jim Norton's name  He knows that  He would get a great reaction  He would get a big applause  And then I left  Yes  That's true  It was ending big  Maybe I misunderstood it  But I thought it went like this  You people are dumb  Who's here to see  Jim Norton  Good night  No no no  I go  God I don't know  What to say  I don't know how to  Get you guys to applaud  Hey you guys like  Jim Norton  Woo  Alright 
[01:47:00]  That's exactly  What Mike was going for  Alright so I'm sorry  And no offense to you  Rich  I was just eating it  In like a way  That I've never experienced  And so I was just  Trying to make jokes  About the show  A drowning man  Will grab with a blade  Of a sword  Oh yeah  Alright  Yes  I think also  Mike comes in here  And he's trying to be  One of the guys there Rich  But you're not allowing him  To like  No it's not true  When we were here last time  It was Mike  Nick and myself  Were the comics  And it was fun  We all had a good time  We had a great 
[01:47:30]  Remember how this all started  Is earlier this morning  You go  Mean  It was a couple comics  And Mike  That was the first joke  That tipped off the whole thing  And then I said back  The thing about your dumb gig  And then we continued  Okay  Here's the thing  I just remembered  How stupid you are  I totally forgot  No like for a second  I'm like  Wait a minute  Rich is really smart  And I'm like  No no no  He's stupid  Like I always thought  I know  I am stupid 
[01:48:00]  But whatever  Oh Christ  He was in there  That being said  Let's have a piece  Alright  Here's the thing  Oh no  Here's the thing again  Let's  Use the word fraudulent  A couple more times Rich  What did you use  At thesaurus.com  This morning  One more time  You're stuttering  There's no audience  In front of you  Calm down  Mike  I don't care  Some people are saying  Rich feels threatened  And that's why  You're going off like this  No I'm reading  I don't think  I'm just commenting  On people commenting  Jim  You got a problem  With me now Jim 
[01:48:30]  Maybe you know  Well you had a problem  I remember you were  Up on stage  And you said something  No problem here  Okay  I don't feel threatened  At all  I want to thank  Anthony  I found out from  Some people  That he threatened  People after I  Walked off stage  Getting booed  He threatened  To shoot people  I did threaten  To shoot  Into the crowd  I don't know  Just randomly  Blast  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Reg  Hold on  I don't know  Why that didn't  Become more of a thing  Because Anthony  Literally reached  And we thought  Holy crap 
[01:49:00]  He does have a gun  That's what I heard  Like anyone would care  If I killed like  Nine people in the audience  But that should have  Been a bigger thing  Because you were  Pretty serious  One was his  You're like  You're not going  To make fun of me  Mother effers  I will shoot you  And then he reached  And realized  Oh that's right  I'm not caring  Because they really  Don't give people a chance  I go to  You know  You go to certain  Ron and Fez events  Like every Ron and Fez event  And they go off  Without a hitch  And the audience  Is pretty nice  And everything like that  And we just have  What amounts to  Circus animals  That have been let 
[01:49:30]  Out of the cages  Sitting down  And drinking  And just instantly  If they don't like  Something  The first second of it  It just gets booed  And that's why  We can't do those anymore  It just got crazy  Let me say one thing  If I could  I don't think  I think there's real  Tension between these guys  Do you?  I didn't know  But I mean  I don't think it's  I don't feel like  Either one is threatened  By that  I don't think Voss is threatened  No, no  I think it's purely sexual  Here's the thing  I'm not threatened  By any comic 
[01:50:00]  I texted Steve last night  About another comic  I texted Steve last night  About another comic  Who was in town  Trying to get him in  Okay  Voss is here in the bus  People are digging Mike  On our show  And then he thinks  It's going to take away  From your time  I know out of your mind  First of all  He looks like you  That's why you like him  Okay  He's the same little  White mold  Shut up  I don't feel at all threatened  We're two different comics  We're two different people  I got eight years  Of history here  I know  Congratulations  Voss  That's only  Two weeks of radio time though

[01:54:30]  The love fest  I just want to plug  One of Rich's gigs  He's at the Quiznos  In Manhattan  This Sunday night  8pm  Oh god  Is that okay  Rich is that  That kind of joke okay  I didn't even know  You were still here Mike  Listen we gotta take a break  Oh my god  I think what we need to do  Is have a Rich Voss  Appreciation day  He doesn't feel the love  From his friends  No it's not that  Anthony didn't invite  I will  And I'm being 
[01:55:00]  Completely honest here  I apologize sincerely  I really do apologize  It was an absolute oversight  There were 150 people  I don't know how  You didn't get invited  I guess probably  I wasn't invited  To the video fest  You guys had  Oh yeah  Oh Jesus  We were trying to  Introduce new comedians  That's all that was about  And Rich  Did I not invite  Bobby and Patrice  Did I not invite you  To my brand new pad  To kind of rub it in  To you  How well I'm doing  Yeah  After I drove you  Halfway home  Yes  The thing with you 
[01:55:30]  And not only that  They gave me a second hand  Toy for the kid  You're  A rewrap  It was  It was supposed to be  For Eastside Dave's kid  I'm like  Yeah  I haven't seen him  In a while  So here  You've got a nice  Jimmy  Boss' thing  You're kind of like  You're so ingrained here  There's almost like  Everyone just assumes  You're going to be there  Because nobody would think  Well don't  It's almost like  Anything that happens  With the show  You're a part of  If you want to be  I think that's what 
[01:56:00]  The thinking is  It's almost like  It's so obvious  To ask you to come  That people assume  It's been done  I feel bad man  Who would ask you  To come to the animation fest  I mean Anthony  He's caught up  In his thing  You know  You pass out at 2  You wake up at 4  You forget things  Anthony didn't even know  He was having a party  Why are all these people  Here today  I get caught in the crossfire  Of your dumb non-invite  To the animation festival  I didn't get invited  To the animation festival  But Biglio  You're a fraud  You're a fraud 
[01:56:30]  Yeah you actually hate us  And you're taking it out on him  I'm sorry  You're right Mike  If you ever stand up again  I'm going to punch you in the face  I said I'm going to be  Oh really  One of my Paul Bonds  Let me tell you something  I'll linger longer on that one  Let me tell you something  I can't take a joke  Opie  My back hurt  My back hurt  That's why I stood up  I'm sorry that I stood up  I'll sit down  You took a very aggressive stance  That was just aggressive  That's not physically aggressive 
[01:57:00]  That's just more comfortable  With the microphone  That way as comics  When I used to sitting  And just you know  Basically right now  I've lost like a caged animal  In a corner  Yeah  When you feel that way  You just want to stand up  Like you're  How you're comfortable  A dodo bird  Attention  Attention  We have to take a break  We're 15 minutes late  For a break  That means we come back  And only do about  10 more minutes  With these guys  Opie and Anthony  Stay there  London Collins  It's Opie and Anthony 
[01:57:30]  In the middle of an all out brawl  Between Rich Vosch and Mike Birbiglia  On a positive note  Can I  I want to plug Bill Burr's CD  Yeah  You do a great Bill Burr  He was just in here  The Bill Burr impression's good  You know that  Bill Burr calls me  A few years ago  And he always calls me  When he needs advice  About something  Like he'll call me up  About like anything technical 
[01:58:00]  He'll be like  What do one of the  How do you get one of these websites  You know what I mean  Like really basic stuff  And then a few years ago  Because I saw a CD  It's like number one on iTunes  It's like doing  It's hilarious  And everything  It's great  And I remembered  A few years ago  Probably two years ago  I get a call from Bill Burr  And he goes  He goes  Hey Mike  You're like a marketing genius  This is how people  Try and grease the wheels  Like as though  That's a compliment  To a comedian  Oh 
[01:58:30]  That's like being like  Hey I saw you set  You really tie your shoes well  That's nice  But he goes  You're like a marketing genius  And I thought he was going to say  Something really technical  He goes  He goes  I don't understand the CD thing  People order it on my website  Then I'm going to the post office  Buying stamps  Sending out 20, 25 of these things  I'm like  Hey Bill  You're like a comedy star  You have an HBO special  You don't have to mail your own CDs  Personally sending a note with each one 
[01:59:00]  What a fool Bill is  Hey isn't it hard to get your CDs on iTunes  No  Do you have to go through a third party  Or you can pretty much do it  You can do it yourself now  Oh okay  Yeah  Hey Keith  That's handy  Keith the cop wants to defend himself  Keith  Good morning  I had to get woken up for this  And I apologize that I'm 10 minutes late  On the conversation  Yeah  But just so we understand  Mr. Voss  What?  You were invited  I personally told you you were invited  You told me outside the comedy cellar  There you go  And this is what  He wanted an invite from Anthony personally 
[01:59:30]  No Keith  That's what this is all about  It could have been an overlook  You said  Anthony's having his party  I think the 16th or whatever  I'll send you an email  When I get all the logistics  That's exactly what you said  Those weren't the words  But you said when you get all the  You know the information  And it's confirmed  I'll send you an email  You know  So I know where I'm going  Did you say that or not?  I did  And then three days before I saw you  And you said  Oh that's good 
[02:00:00]  I got spots  I'll come out to the house  And then I'll go  Keith be careful  He's a little sensitive to that  That was Mike  If you want to call him for marketing advice  We'll get his number  Go ahead  So that was it  So three days before  You said you were coming out  And then you were going to do spots  No no no  I saw you  It wasn't three days before  When I saw you  You said  We're having a party  I said great  Because that weekend  I'm doing  I'm doing  City spots

This Friday and Saturday  In Worcester  End the show quickly  Here we are  XM Satellite Radio  Sirius XM Satellite Radio  Whatever it's called  Everybody calm now?  Yeah we're talking  We're talking politics now 
[02:14:30]  And that isn't working  Very well either  Oh really?  I think we're in great disagreement  On the um  Yeah  Mike Birbiglia made the walk  Rich Voss made the walk  I barely made the walk  After what I witnessed  I had to go to the bathroom  And shit my brains out  Wow  Talking to Voss  About politics  Is like talking  Like talking to a child  About science  Oh boy  Well no I can see  Why you want Obama  I mean  What's wrong with Obama?  He's a fucking uh  Listen he's a 
[02:15:00]  He's a  He is a socialist  He's this close to being  A communist  He is  He's a socialist  Motherfucker  No he's not  He's such a socialist  Ugh  Tax the shit out of everybody  And give it to social programs  He believes in tax cuts  For 95% of the country  Oh oh  Instead of the people  That uh  The fucking whole thing  Rests on their back  People that make uh  Some money  That achieved what is  Supposed to be the  American dream  And then you penalized  Up the ass for it  By the democrats  Yeah  Oh you did a great job  You did exactly 
[02:15:30]  What this country  Was supposed to be  You work your way up  You do well for yourself  You gather some wealth  Get a house  And then  We're gonna fuck you  And make you pay  For everybody else now  Because you know  Since when was that America  That's fucking uh  Socialism  Like they're such hypocrites  Let's do low housing  Let's keep them out  Of our neighborhoods  And keep our property value up  Yes  Let's keep giving to them  Let's keep them there  Let's keep them there  Let's  Let's  Let's  Let's  Let's  Go ahead  I hope Obama wins  But uh  More than that 
[02:16:00]  Obviously I hope he's a good  A good president  If he wins  Because if he's not  We're gonna hear the n-word  A lot  Oh  Then it  Then it comes back  Full bore  We're gonna  We're gonna  All these people  Who have been waiting  For years  Using the n-word  Behind closed doors  You know  With their wives  And trusted neighbors  Who they  Who they  Kind of  Test out  Over the years  That's a good point  In the schools  When they have the pictures  Of all the presidents  It'll just have the n-word  Under his  If he's a terrible president 
[02:16:30]  The n-word is gonna be  It's so in vogue  Even if he's a good president  I said to you  I said to Anthony earlier  He's a good looking  Well speaking guy  If he looked like  Well speaking  Well speaking  Well speaking  Sorry  Guys  He's a well speaking guy  If he looked like  Idi Amin  What do you like about  Red  If he looked like  Idi Amin  If he looked like  Idi Amin  He wouldn't have a shot  Yeah  Would he have a shot  If he looked like  Idi Amin  No that's the old joke  Everyone  Yeah if he looked like  Flavor Flav  He wouldn't have a shot 
[02:17:00]  Yes I know  Okay  So it's based on  It's based on  The way he looks  A lot of it is  There's no substance  People in this country  He's gonna get to vote  25 and under  But people  Is he still talking  I'm sorry  Holy shit  You know what  That's brutal  Well I think  I think that actually  I was hoping  Edwards would win  But  Yeah  Oops  Yeah  Same hairline  The  What  It doesn't end with Rich 
[02:17:30]  Alright Rich  So you're lucky enough  To be well into your 50s  And you got a full head of hair  Oh I'm sorry  I forgot  So why are you being hurtful  With the guys  That might be losing a few  I'm sorry  Manager to Mike  Is there something  That came out  Alright  Manager to Mike  Okay  As soon as you  Start speaking English  Why don't you come back  To the show  So you wanted Edwards  What happened  He didn't make it  Didn't make it  But  Don't you  Don't you guys think  That the story  Is bogus  About Edwards 
[02:18:00]  That that's even  A news story  That he had an affair  Like that  How is that  A fucking news story  Same with Clinton  Same with all  But it's not  But it's not  A news story  No it is  It's like an  You tell someone  At a party  No it's kind of  A news story  Because he's supposed  To be this  Trustworthy guy  That's the thing  When you're the president  You're supposed to be  Trustworthy  You're not supposed  To have this  Deceitful thing  In your life  Yeah but like  With Clinton  Like that was  Just part of his process  Yeah  He gets blown  Under his desk  If that happened  Before the election 
[02:18:30]  He probably wouldn't  Have been elected  If it happened  He was already president  They went to impeach him  They impeached him  Would it have held you  Back from voting for him  No I wouldn't give a shit  I wasn't going to vote  For Clinton anyway  Clinton was brilliant  And he gets blown  At 10  Under his desk  So that he can work  On peace  In Northern Ireland  Until 2  I don't have a problem  With that  Bush goes to bed  At 10  He goes to bed  That's offensive to me  Listen to me  He lied under oath  Sorry I got carried away  He lied under oath  He lied under oath  Yes because  So what do you draw the line 
[02:19:00]  What do you draw the line  At lying  Deception  He was deceiving the people  That's all  He's the president  What did he say  Deception  You wouldn't get the points  In Scrabble for that  Where's our Scrabble board  Oh it's right there  Why wouldn't I get the points  In Scrabble board  Let's go  Ages 8 and up  Great  You're playing  Jimmy and Scrabble today  The best  The only thing  George Bush has done right  In 8 years  Is not get blown  Under his desk  That's the only thing  He's like  I didn't get blown  Under my desk  I'll agree 
[02:19:30]  I'll agree with you  On that one  I'm basically  A Republican  But I think I'm more  Like libertarian  Yeah  I don't stick  To Republican party lines  Like I could give a shit  If a woman wants to  Fucking take an auger  To her cunt  To get a baby out of there  It doesn't bother me  In the least  Nice  But  I'm a second amendment guy  I love guns  I love the ability  To go in and buy  A fucking gun  And shoot guns  And love  Abortions with guns  You guys gotta play Scrabble 
[02:20:00]  As we talk politics  That fucking paradox  Alright  You just  Oh my god  Rich is breaking out  His glasses for Scrabble  Oh no  I got my specs  What are those  Fucking Ben Franklin glasses  I'm sorry  I don't have Armani glasses  To read  I'm just saying  What the fuck  Those are Benjamin Franklin glasses  Is all I'm saying  What are you looking at with them  You fucking charm bracelets  Come on  Look at  Here's my grandchildren  This is  This is  You're among friends  Ricky  Fucking Ruth Gordons  I gotta go 
[02:20:30]  I gotta go buy  Some glasses  At CBS  So I can play Scrabble  Yeah that's what they look like  Rich  Don't follow him  Hey listen  How did you pick those  Hold on  I don't  I got ten pairs of these  From all over the place  We'll get back to abusing Rich  But there's  There's something  We might want to consider today  Something pressing  Everyone made the walkover  Did you notice  Who was outside today  Waiting to come up  Oh my god  Yes  I did not  I saw him  I say we go for it man  Holy fuck  I know we don't  Have a contract  Who is it  I was saying  If it's who I'm thinking of 
[02:21:00]  If it's who I'm thinking of  Alright  This is  This is the end of a big story  We bring him up  And we acknowledge the fact  That he's completely out of his mind  And let's get to the bottom  Of what happened that day  I say  What happened to our balls  I say you ate  27 days  Fuck that  Whatever  I say you have to  Yeah  He was the guy  That was responsible  Can you give me the background  It wasn't his fault  Are you keeping it secret  I'm going to say this  And people are going to go  They're going to get a little freaky out there  Homeless Charlie's outside of the studio  I think you're going to see him 
[02:21:30]  Oh is this the colonoscopy fellow  Homeless Charlie got suspended  From satellite radio  Yeah  Which is almost impossible  He said hard things  About the first lady  About  About  Who else  The queen of England  The queen  And  Rice  Is there a smell issue  Combalisa rice  Like if he comes in  Is it going to  I say we haven't come back yet  We just take care of this first  And you don't need any problems  When you negotiate  It's silly  It is silly  It's not  I would leave it alone 
[02:22:00]  I say it's not silly  As long as we acknowledge  Where this is coming from  Nah  I would leave it alone  Right now  We don't have a boss right now  Until  That's  That's exactly it  We don't have a boss right now  And if we continue on this route  We won't have one  How does  How does  Homeless Charlie's act  Compared to rich bosses  Like giving  Mangala another chance  What's that  Right  The thing is this  I'm all for having him  Does he have as much material as boss  Mike  They're talking  Oh I'm sorry 
[02:22:30]  I'm all for having him back on  Actually  I say not now though  But I am all for having him  Bigley is probably a big  Fucking word there  In Scrabble  Probably a good score  Nine letters  Nine letters  Yeah try to get  We could cut it down  And put hack  Holy shit  Holy shit  You already picked one in your hand  Now you pick one in your hand first  It's so weird that  Voss would call me  Call me a hack  You're not a hack  You're a bowdack  Because I actually  Well you know  I just  All I do is tell stories about myself  So obviously I'm not hacking those  But your jokes are 
[02:23:00]  Is that why you're calling this  Sleepwalking  Yeah because it's a true story  He sleepwalks  He sleepwalks  I know I heard that  That was  That was  Some of Voss' jokes  No  I'm not  And I'm not making this up  Like sometimes I hear  Your jokes on stage  And I'm like  Is that from a joke book  Like literally  Is that from a joke book  See that's the difference  Between you and I  You watch me  I don't watch you  But the question is  Is that hack  Like if you do a joke  From a joke book  Is that hack  Or are you just  A cabaret entertainer  Mike  Mike  I've never done a joke 
[02:23:30]  From a joke book  So you know what  The difference is  No no I don't know  If you have  I'm just wondering  I'm telling you right now  I never did  And next time you watch me  Take notes  I go first  You don't go first  I go first  I never do this  I do take notes  I just write an X  Do not do this  Are you kidding me  In Scrabble  What goes first  Lowest or highest  What  What goes first  Lowest or highest  I think it's arbitrary  Based on what you decide  It's tough to answer your question  As you look over your glasses  As you ask the question  I can't fucking deal 
[02:24:00]  With those glasses  It's not going to make you smarter  Ranch  Yeah  Hey  So we're getting homeless Charlie  Up here or what  I think that's a bad idea  At this juncture  And the only reason  I'm saying that  Is because  You know  There are business dealings  Going on right now  That I don't think  We need to throw  Any monkey wrenches into  And I don't mean that  In any way  But the literal sense  Of taking a monkey wrench  And throwing it in  I do say we have him up  Just not now  We don't know  When he's going to  Come around again 
[02:24:30]  What  We'll just tell him  To come back  He's homeless  Yeah  He's out there  All the time somehow  Yeah  Oh Rich  I see a word  I can't believe  No one shows up  To Rich's shows  When he tours  He plays Scrabble  On the air all the time  It's so charming  Oh fuck  Rich goes first  Do you really think  You're good at this  Or are you  No  I have shit words  Rich  Shit letters  Who goes first  In the Scrabble  We don't have to like  Focus on the game  The entire time  I just want to see  The kickoff

[02:34:30]  And these two have been going  Relax your mind  Body and soul  What a great idea  There's so many energy drinks  Out there  This is the anti-energy drink  Yeah nice save  So it'll mellow you out  But there was a reference  About the packaging  Being a little bit  Not heterosexual  I don't think there was  Well are you marketing  The black people  The purple and stuff  Oh jeez  Why do you have to bring  Race into it  Because that's what they like  Now what this is  Is uh  The anti-energy drink  And this is natural right  All natural 
[02:35:00]  Melatonin valerian  Yep  Slow your roll  It'll chill you out  Veg you out  I'm confused  Because it looks like  It has sugar in here JBL  There is some sugar in it  But the sugar hypes you up  So how does this make you  Drowsy  How much melatonin's in here  I'll have to look  The melatonin valerian  Is  One milligram  Is this legal  Is this stuff legal  Yes it's legal  It's all natural  Melatonin is what your brain  Produces to help you sleep  It's natural  So instead of taking  A vacuum at night  Or taking some type of drug  You come home  You take a drink 
[02:35:30]  And you chill out  Or some warm milk  This is what Anthony  Had to say about JBL  Not knowing JBL  Was outside the studio  And that the boys  Gave us all one of these drinks  Uh  To enjoy  Before JBL  Came in here today  Thank you Mike  And that purple  Fag fucking  Elixir that is  What is this shit  Why  Why Anthony  What is this shit  It couldn't be  More horrendous  He's here 
[02:36:00]  He's here to promote  His product  Not  Not have it destroyed  Before it even  Hits the market  This is  This was a  Misunderstanding sir  I want you to know  That I had no clue  Because of this  Unique packaging  That it was  Your product  I did not know  It was turned away  And all I saw  Is  A purplish color  Which is indicative  To perhaps  Some people  In the gay community  Appreciate this color  More so than  Other people  Anthony goes to  His white guy voice 
[02:36:30]  His black comedian's  White guy voice  Thank you  Well sir  Actually  Because of the  Purple packaging  That's what I thought  I would never  Really honestly  Think this was shit  I don't think  Nor would I think  It was a fag  Concoction or elixir  I'm not sure  JBL's headphones  Were working properly  I want to make sure  JBL hears this  Motherfucker  Once again  From about 10 minutes ago  And that purple  Fag fucking  Elixir that is  What is this shit  You guys 
[02:37:00]  This can should be  Coming out of  Some gay guy's ass  It's going to be  Coming out of mine  I think  You're playing  Scrabble at 930  In the morning  And you're calling  My drink gay  Exactly  These two fruits  Are playing Scrabble  Please I'm trying  To just usher it off  Spell homo  R-I-C-H  This is nothing  I got it  Thanks  I liked it  Wow  What a novel idea  Because  Is it Anthony  Energy drinks 
[02:37:30]  Are all over the place  Yeah  You see them all over  I mean  Diamond Dozen  Where have you seen  A anti-energy drink  Where you know  You're home at night  Maybe you can't get to sleep  You chug one down  Mike on Comedy Central  Mike  Did you hear that  Is this part  Is this like  Was that a poem  Or something  Because no one was laughing  So I didn't know  What it was  They're not all  Hey can I  Drink a numbers game  Can I  Can I  Say something  We've been talking about  The anti-energy 
[02:38:00]  Drink  It's called drank  And not one  E-Rock joke yet  What's wrong with us  We're slacking  What  Oh wow  It's called drank  But Iraq anti-energy  Anti-energy  No it's not an anti-talent  There you go  It's not an anti-skinny  See that's how jokes were  Yeah  People say  It's funny  And then people laugh  I even brought something  For your boy Sam  I understand it's Sam's birthday  Coming up  It is  Oh wow  The hat that I wore  In the last several pay-per-views 
[02:38:30]  The cowboy hat  Sam being a wrestler  Whoa  I've actually autographed it  Signed it  And I've got  A drink for him too  Jimmy give me that hat  Oh no  Jimmy please give me that hat  If he wasn't 6 foot 8  I'd be happy to hand it to you  Is he a wrestler  Wow Sam  Is he a wrestler  No boss  He's not  He's a mathematician  It's still got the whiskey stain on it  It's still got the whiskey stain on it  From where CM Punk threw the whiskey on me  A few years  A few weeks ago  On television  Oh wow  Can I see that Sam  Please  Let me see  What is that 
[02:39:00]  A Stetson  So are you  Are you an ultimate fighting  Is that what it is  Promoter is  Oh boy  Promoter  Oh Jesus  First his product  Is called shit  Now I'm doing a what  He actually fights in the fake world  Oh Jesus  Don't call it that  You don't know who he is  No I'm asking  Because I'm a nice party guest  This is a catastrophe  You've got to help out by perhaps complimenting him  Asking him questions 
[02:39:30]  Is his name JBL  JBL  From the WWE  Sorry about that JBL  He's one of our favorites  He's famous  I'm sorry man  I'm new  I'm new  I don't know  He used to  To TV  He's an icon  He used to do stock stuff  Until what happened  Because you were good at that  It was controversy  Yeah  Controversy  Munich Germany  Had a small problem over there  Such bullshit  But now  On Fox News  Every single night  And every single Saturday morning  On Cashing In  Because you were really good at that 
[02:40:00]  I wish you would have  Gave us some advice  On our Citadel stock  Oh  Media stocks  Huh  Aren't they great  Thumbs up for the media stocks  About like financials right now  Yeah  They're getting killed  Awful  Awful  Alright  I will say that  Oh wait  Back to Scrabble  I'm not even a wrestling fan  And I know who he is  Well we love JBL  He's done the show  He's a very famous guy  I apologize you guys  I'm just  You know what  I represent the  The uneducated listeners today  Who don't know about JBL  And I'm learning 
[02:40:30]  Why is Rich here  Oh that's good  I'm glad to be a part of it  Uneducated  He's  He's the  Hold on  Thing one wants to talk  He's the longest reigning  World champion  In the history of Smackdown  Yeah good for him  Oh okay  Wow  Alright  Is that like  Is this the same organization  That like Hulk Hogan was in  Yeah  Same organization  Well many years ago  It was the WWF  Now it's called the WWE  Because the World Wildlife Federation  Said  What the fuck are you doing  Yeah yeah  Really 
[02:41:00]  We lost a lawsuit  To a bunch of pandas  Yeah  Oh okay  Which is so stupid  To this day  Because most people  Know WWF  As wrestling  And not as pandas  But they got to it first  Yeah apparently so  Yeah  And then you're the champion  That's amazing  I'm so glad  To be here  The champ  You could  Who do you want to hurt first  That's sarcastic  I think that was sarcasm  Yeah  I heard a little sarcasm  I'll tell you who he doesn't  I'll tell you who he doesn't  Want to hurt  The little Scrabble player  Enjoying his beverage  What do you think 
[02:41:30]  About the packaging  Fucking  There's the only way  To package it  Would be with a light purple  How else do you say  Mellow  Because it's like a rose  You know what  That's how you package that  At first  You're right  Only a douchebag  Wouldn't understand that  I happen to understand  Wait can I  This says Mellow  Wait you mean  What Anthony said  Do you still have that butcher  Oh jeez  I didn't like it  What  I didn't like it  This says above  125th street  No no  I now understand  They probably did a study  On a relaxing color 
[02:42:00]  And this is probably  A very relaxing  Color  So I understand now  I was ignorant  And uneducated  On your product  When  When  This tape was  Being made  This tape right here  And that purple  Fag  Fucking  Elixir that is  What  What is this shit  I didn't  I didn't know  JBL was coming in today  And so for a split second  I thought he was  The homeless guy  You guys were talking about  That is a well dressed 
[02:42:30]  Handsome homeless man  Isn't he  He just got a beautiful suit  He did well for the Orioles  Back in the day  Very much  What  But I thought it was like  A Horatio Alger  You kind of pick him up  By his bootstraps  Yeah yeah  Bring him off the street  And watch him  Just screw up again  Can I get a fucking vowel  What  Oh  Oh what happened  Nothing  Jimmy can't get a vowel  He can't make a word  You had a pass Jimmy  No I took it  What did you make  I put toll  T-O-L-I-F-4  We got four points  Toll  Oh yeah T-O-L-L  All right  Rich you got a question 
[02:43:00]  For JBL  And his awesome drink  Drank  It's called Drank  It's anti-energy  Do I have a question for him  Yeah  What would you do  With these letters  Keep them up  That is damn fun  Sam  I have a question for him  Yeah  Yeah  I think it's a good  Yeah whatever  What am I going to do  I'm trying to  I'm trying to  Do you know  Hey JBL  Here's my concern  About the  The Drank  Drank  It's called Drank 
[02:43:30]  Is it  Kind of a  Is it kind of a  Natural ingredient  That makes you calm down  Yes  Melatonin valerian  Oh okay  Or  It's very similar  To watching a  Scrabble game on radio  Yeah  We know this is terrible  Absolutely  It's been addressed  There's a little warning  On here  This product may cause  Drowsiness  Not recommended  More than two servings  Within a 24 hour period  Oh nice  Let's go with  Wow  What happens  Someone just ought to  Chug the shit out of like  A case of this  And see what happens 
[02:44:00]  Yeah  Have you done the studies  On people drinking  Too much of this stuff  Done the studies  You know you gotta put  Warnings on everything  Nowadays  Or it gets sued  Does the FDA know about this  Absolutely  Oh okay  And do they know about  The boner juice  Mama Juana  Yes  Absolutely  The energy drink for me  And I'll put it right here  In the middle of the  We want to know  What happened to the  Boner juice  It's still out there  It's an energy drink  For men  People take it  It's a daily use product  We're in vitamin shop  All around the country  In about 4,000 stores  Also around the country  So you must be so busy 
[02:44:30]  You got the Mama Juana  You're a wrestling star  You got the drank  Yeah  This guy knows  What he's doing  He's an entrepreneur  He's an entrepreneur  Yeah  My stocks are down  A few thousand dollars  I don't know a whole lot  About stocks  I just invested this year  It's a very tough market  I hope you diversified  Because in this market  You really do need to hedge  Bullshit  And protect yourself  All in one basket  That's what they say  That's a great investment strategy  Yes  I put all of your money  And even mortgage your house  All in one basket 
[02:45:00]  That's right  I have put it  I have put it  In George Bush pillowcases  Wow  I should have put it  In fucking bombing jokes  Do you have a B  An O  And an O  In those letters  I like George Bush pillowcases  I just thought  I was more of a thinker  Nah it stunk all  As I was  That was bombing  Those are joke books  That I use  What's that?  Oh  A callback  If you want to stop  The conversation anymore  Why don't you have to  Press a button first  Before you do it  I'm just happy 
[02:45:30]  You bailed me out  Of my fucking  Fuck sweat  Holy Jesus  He's getting you  In the later rounds here  I'm getting the  Early rounds  You were really good  But  Now he's just jabbing away  I'm so stupid  I thought you were talking  About the Scrabble game  And giving me a boost  He's talking about  Fucking Babay  With a smashing ball  Hey Sam  You got a question for JBL?  Well have you guys  Talked about Unforgiven  This Sunday on pay-per-view?  Unforgiven  That's all we've been  Talking about  We've got so much going on  Yeah  Unbelievable  Very busy gentleman  Thank God JBL's  A forgiven man  JBL went mine 
[02:46:00]  Thank God  I sure got off  On the wrong foot  What does it stand for  JBL?  Unforgiven  Jet Propulsion  It just means  It's unforgiven  That's what his name means?  No  It's the name of  A pay-per-view  Coming up  Where there's a  World Championship  Match  Which I'm in  Against CM Punk  Who is our  Drug-free champion  Who says he doesn't  Drink or smoke  He calls it healthy  I call that boring  Hit Michael  Have another one man  Show in a month  That's probably true 
[02:46:30]  See he's doing  A sleepwalking show  They're jumping each other  Just going at it  Yeah  Uncomfortable  Maybe this will help  My sleepwalking  This calming juice  Oh  See  I have a sleepwalking  Disorder  I have a hard time  See now we found an angle  How to sell the new product  Drink  Yeah  And then maybe  I'll try drink  That could help  Your sleepwalking  In the hard time  That could be helped  By Mama Juana  In the hard times  He's basically saying  You don't get erections  Yeah  Is that what you're saying  JBL 
[02:47:00]  That's an issue  I'm saying it helps  JBL  What do you recommend  As far as  Investing  In this climate  That we're in  Right now  The problem is  The financials  They still haven't  Completely unfolded yet  House prices  Still have to come down  Banks aren't  Loaning money  So credit is  Deteriorating rapidly  So  Any type of  Renewable energy  Is pretty big  Renewable energy  As in  Wind  Wind power  Yeah solar  Wind  Wind  Solar are going to be huge  Turbines  Yeah  Nuclear 
[02:47:30]  My account has me in lead hats  He said buy lead hats  And keep the heat on your head  It's like a Woody Allen joke  Now JBL  I've noticed  And this might be  My investor has me in lead hats  Lead  31  This might be  But I've noticed  A resurgence  In my area  Of new construction again  Which was really just dead  Houses were sitting there  Half built  Could this be a sign  That maybe the housing market  Is coming back  It could be a sign 
[02:48:00]  That it's not completely dead  Unfortunately  Housing prices  Banks aren't loaning money  80% of loans  Were securitized  From 2001  Until now  That's not happening  So you don't have a market  For these loans to go to  So because of supply and demand  That's probably going to drive  House prices down further  But you are seeing  Bastards  Yeah  Bearer of bad news  You are seeing some resurgence  In a lot of parts of the world  Good  Because you know something  I think I bought  Exactly at the wrong time  Just like everything else  I do when I'm investing 
[02:48:30]  Yeah the same thing  Holy jeez  I turned $5,000 into like  $320  Yeah  It's just amazing  How badly you can screw up  On your own  I tell you what  If Obama gets elected  You can get into a home  And if you can't pay your mortgage  He'll bail you out  Yeah apparently so  You're bailing out everybody else  With money from the people  The taxpayers  I would assume you're  Like a McCain guy there JBL  I'm pretty much an independent  I don't like Obama's  Redistribution of wealth  Which is what I think is  Thank you  I don't think it's pathetic 
[02:49:00]  I mean these guys  You don't legislate ignorance  These people are too stupid  To know they can't afford  These homes  Rich is talking  That's bad  But you can't  You can't bail these guys out  Not with taxpayers money  Thank you  Although my only debate  With that would be  Though we do kind of  Bail out banks  And we do kind of  We do forgive foreign debt  It's true  Like what bothers me  And I'm not  I'm not a redistribute  The wealth guy at all  But I am disgusted  With the way  If we need something  In the UN  We'll forgive  10 billion in debt  For some shit nation  Just to get them  To do what we want  But yet people here 
[02:49:30]  Are you  Call marks  What else you got to say  I'm only saying  There are better ways  To I think  But there are people  Who make a lot of  Shitty decisions  But the banks  Always get bailed out  Not to mention  You want a president  Who's going to work  Towards not  Exporting jobs  Yeah  I mean  And building industry  At home  Because we're losing  Our middle class  Yeah we are  The main thing  You've got to do  Is lower the corporate  Tax rate  Thank you  So that rich people  Make more money  And they don't pay  Their employees  That well  And give them health insurance 
[02:50:00]  So that businesses  Can afford to be here  They lowered the corporate  Tax rate in Ireland  And they went from  14% unemployment  Down to 4%  I'm not talking about  Lowering on specific individuals  I'm talking about  Lowering on businesses  You know  Businesses  They can hire more people  If you take  But the jobs  Are kind of going  If you raise corporate taxes  They have to make their money  Up somewhere  They're going to let people go  And then  The taxpayers  It's supposed to  Be saddled with  Health care  Yeah  Sorry  You know something 
[02:50:30]  There's no guarantee  I keep saying  This country  Wasn't based on  A guarantee  Of prosperity  You have a chance  To  Be prosperous  In this country  But there's no  Fucking guarantee  That you're going to  Have health care  And have a great job  And be able to  It's a chance  It's some  Part luck  It's part talent  Skill  Hard work  Whatever it is  I don't know why  Everybody assumed  All of a sudden  That this country  Is this place  Where you come  And you're guaranteed  To be taken care of  It just doesn't 
[02:51:00]  No  It doesn't work that way  Some people  Are going to be  Fucking left out  In the cold  Sorry  Go to fucking Canada  They're all crazy  Up there anyway  It's all bullshit  Their health care  You're sitting  Sorry  You're sitting  You're sitting  In the waiting room  There for two days  Yeah  Oh all their free  Health care  You hear about in Canada  Yeah you sit there  For two three days  There's gotta be  Why didn't you  Fucking  Yeah  There's gotta be  A balance  Between  You're right  You don't see  Six armed kids  Being flown to Canada  To have their arms  Chopped off 
[02:51:30]  Absolutely  They come here  To the old US of A  But there's gotta be  A balance between that  And some people  Who really just  Can't get shit  They need  I'm not saying  You fucking give it all away  You can't  You can't  It's redistribution of wealth  Just like Mr. JBL said  The country can't adopt you  Right  It's socialism  You gotta be on your own  Sure  And I'm against  These bailouts of these companies  I mean you got  Goldman Sachs down here  That is a fantastic company  They don't get any money  But all of a sudden  You have Bear Stearns  Turn into just a disaster  And the government  Backs them to $30 billion 
[02:52:00]  It's just  We're legislating ignorance  And we're backing  Bad business decisions  Which is contrary  To the American way  It's what works  In Sherwood Forest  But doesn't work here  And I'll tell you  Another thing  About health care  You got somebody  Like Tippi Tom  Do you think  He's got fucking insurance  He spent time  In the hospital  Getting his legs  Taken care of  You could walk  Into an emergency room  In this country  And get taken care of  When you're that bad  You can  Of course you can  But to prevent yourself  From getting that  And I'm not talking 
[02:52:30]  About people  That abuse the system  But like  He has to basically  Be having his leg  Needing amputation  Well it's because  He's stupid  Plus he drinks a lot  And he shifts his pants  I'm not saying  There's no issues  On Tom's side either  Tom's responsible  Yeah but what is  Health care all right  I just think  We could stand  To have someone  In the White House  Who's looking  To create prosperity  Versus sitting on our  Prosperity  Which is what our  President does now  Well  He's in the last  Eight years  He's basically  Because he's in bed  With all the oil companies  And he went to 
[02:53:00]  A war for oil  And that's  That's all  I don't see it  As a war for oil  I see it as a war  For a bullshit  But as far as  The  I think it's more  Of a war for  This guy wanted  My daddy dead  So I'm  Yeah I agree with that  Hang him  Have him hung  Two trillion dollars  Three trillion dollars  But nothing's gotten done  More than anything  Oh absolutely  I'll agree with that  I'm not a big fan  Of George W. Bush  That's for sure  The guy  He hasn't done  Most presidents  You see  Every so often  They sit down  In the White House  And they're signing things  You know  Working  And they get their pens out 
[02:53:30]  They hand the pens out  They sign bills  I've never seen Clinton  Doing that all the time  He's just signing stuff  George W.  I haven't seen him  He hasn't done shit  As far as  He's good at fly fishing  In fairness  To sign something  You've got to be able to read  And I  Don't  Don't talk about  Rich Voss  This isn't  This isn't  This isn't  About the war  This is about spending  The problem is spending  If you're going  Spending three trillion dollars  On a war  Puts us in debt  And it makes  Our money 
[02:54:00]  Last around the world  You're talking about spending  Several hundred billion dollars a year  Which is too much  I agree with that  But the problem is  You've got to take it out somewhere  No matter the justification  Of the war or not  Put that aside  You've got to take it out somewhere  And these guys  Are spending  Like they have the money  To do it  And they don't  You had a hundred  You had a hundred thousand dollars  In the last Iraqi war bill  For a Punxsutawney film museum  Right  The guy  You can talk about  Pork barrel stuff all day  You can have  You can have  Kind of  Incidents all day  That's not a real argument  No it's a huge argument 
[02:54:30]  No no  No no  The isolated examples  Are not an argument  Bullshit  These assholes  Would be in jail  If they were in a private enterprise  These congressmen  Would be in jail  If they did that  In private enterprise  But they're doing it here  And they're getting away with it  So it's not  Yeah  It's not something  Absolutely  It is status quo  But status quo sucks  Yeah but you know what  When Clinton came into  All I know is  When Clinton came into office  We were two trillion in debt  And everybody says  No one  No one could balance the budget  And he tried 
[02:55:00]  And he did  And we ended up  With a surplus  By decimating  He cut back on military  Military  Intelligence  Yes  There were more attacks  On American soil  And on Americans  During his administration  Than any other administration  On American soil  There's only one  Well I mean  On Americans  And American soil  Rich if we know anything  From 9-11  It's that they planned  These things for  10-11 years  Before they even happened  That's why this argument 
[02:55:30]  Is so bogus  When they say  We haven't been attacked  The last seven years  Yeah they're working on it  For 0-12  Assholes  Oh shit  Well who is it Mike  What do you mean  Tell us  Oh bullshit  So they're that smart  That they're sitting around  They're just playing  Because they're that much  Smarter than us  Did you follow  The 9-11 investigation  Wait but do you  How many attacks  Have been deterred  Since Bush has been  In office  I don't know  17  How many Rich  Well we know  We know at least Seattle  Yes there were 
[02:56:00]  There were  Throughout the world  In Italy  Spain  There has been  Trains blown up  People  Killed all over the world  From  From Arab extremists  It's not happening  In this country now  Why  Because Bush  Put money in defense  Clinton took away  Money from defense  He knocked down the CIA  Bush brought it back  See  So we're a little safer  With him in office  I don't know  There you go  Let's get back to Scrabble  I agree with that last part  When you said I don't know

Your healthcare in Canada?  Yeah  All I hear from people  All I hear from people  And I'm talking Canadians  Is the fact that you have to  Wait and wait and wait  For  For  For  Operations  I have to wait  Procedures  I have to wait a lot  But if we wait  Two days for an operation  We're not losing our house  Because we have to pay 
[03:03:30]  For the operation  We're not going into  Massive loads of debt  To do it  And the problem with waiting  Though is waiting  In a waiting room  Full of Canadians  Canada's not that bad  If you got rid of the Canadians  JBL  JBL  I think he went to that  I think he's got the joke book  JBL  JBL are you there?  I'm here yes  He borrowed Voss' joke book  Good question sidebar  Now that I've ranted  At Professor Anthony  Do you really enjoy  That drink?  Absolutely  Ramone  Somebody fuck JBL

[03:04:30]  I know I did  You did start it  I did start it  That's true  You did start it  The lack of respect  For this guy  Who is  You know  A lot of wrestlers  They go through wrestling  And they go through that career  And they end up  Fucking brain damaged  And broke  JBL is a smart  Educated guy  And look at him  He's got products out there  You got a boner thing  Going on  Tell us about the boner stuff  What is this  He gives you the boner  It's an energy drink for men 
[03:05:00]  It raises your testosterone level  Your libido  Raises your energy level  All natural  Nice  He's the fountain of youth  Makes you 19 again  JBL  Why are you wrestling at this point  I enjoy it  With all these skills  I love it  With the entrepreneurial skills you got  I grew up watching wrestling  I love it  I absolutely love it  I always wanted to be a wrestler  I got a chance  I broke my back a couple years ago  In a match in London  And got a chance to come back  And wrestle  And I'm enjoying it  So Jimmy in a rest area  What's that?  Nothing  Make sure you press the button boss  I have a question for JBL 
[03:05:30]  Uh oh  Uh oh  Have you ever  No alright  I won't ask you  No go ahead Mike  No Mike  Please  Someone's got to ask me a question  Some of us don't want to drink to drink  This isn't insulting  Because I think  The WWE stuff is great  Have you ever considered  Like a real wrestling  Like Olympic wrestling  Actually  Oh yeah  At 95  Yeah at 95  No no  I'm too old  Jesus  We actually had a tournament  In the WWE years ago  It was a legit straight up tournament 
[03:06:00]  Yeah  It was a hybrid tournament  Between boxing and wrestling  And I was in that  Wow  Made it to the finals  And made a bad mistake  I you know  I fought sober  And I got called by a left hook  By Bart Gunn  I'm gonna say  That was a good question  Oh I forgot about that  I remember that one  I forgot about that  Holy shit  Yeah I remember that one  Wow  Rocked  That's when Vince was losing his mind  Yeah  I want people to beat the shit out of each other  That's right  Start punching each other for real  I forgot about that 
[03:06:30]  They went legit for a while  With the boxing and everything  It's the brawl for all  Yeah  The brawl for all  The brawl for all  He knows everything  Well Butterbean came in at like Wrestlemania I think 15  To fight Bart Gunn after the brawl for all  Right right  Ah  How did that end up  He rocked him  Butterbean won the fight  Butterbean  Big fucking volcano looking guy  He's like a little fat broad groupie  Look at you  You're like a little fat bitch after a reality show  Look at him  Sam loves his wrestling  Sam knows everything about wrestling  I got a present for you  A wrestling one  You'll love it  Have you guys seen my JBL hat 
[03:07:00]  Hey can I see it  Yeah it's nice  I don't really see it  You see it with your eyes  He gave you that  We saw it on a naked cowboy in Times Square  It's on TV  Sam let me see it  Please  He can't even fit it on  Oh my god  That afro  Sam let me get a picture of you in the JBL hat  Alright we're from a distance  Get over here  Well you can see me  There's a zoom  I have a question for you  Yeah wrestling question  Yes about wrestling  Vince McMahon  Give me an update on his condition  Yeah  Any news on what happened when he was caught under the lights and that equipment 
[03:07:30]  And then that was it  What happened  No  Ant's talking about that fake thing he did  No no  He was very injured I hear  They're doing the right thing and keeping it private  Still  The family is dealing with it  I'm milking this fucking storyline for god's sake  Well Shane and Stephanie are in charge of the company in the interim  And Mike Adam Lee has been named GM of Raw  So they're carrying on with business as usual  When will Vince make an appearance so he can show that he's okay  Hopefully 
[03:08:00]  Well again I don't know they're keeping it private  So hopefully he's okay  And he'll be able to make a full recovery and come back  How long of a vacation does this guy need  I know really  Get back already  Vince McMahon does not take vacations  What is he getting a facelift  What is he getting done  He's got to be getting some work done right  Is that it  Wow that's a good one  Yeah he's got something  I bet he is  Get a liposuction  What's he doing  A giant screen fell on him  Yeah sure  His face is going to be all pulled back  Let me tell you something  Collagen lips  I know you  Kiss my ass  Killer Kowalski 
[03:08:30]  Yeah  The great Killer Kowalski  Yes  JBL  Any words on Killer?  On KK  Yeah  Killer was  Killer made giant Bob in Japan  One of the stories  Killer was such a huge name  When he went over there  And lost to giant Bob  That's what made giant Bob in Japan  Killer was a tremendous  I don't know who giant Bob is  Giant Bob was  Probably the greatest  Greatest wrestler in Japan  He and Antonio  Bob Kelly  Giant Bob  Antonio Anoki 
[03:09:00]  Was the guy who fought  Muhammad Ali  Back in the 70s  Sure  He had one territory  And the other territory  That was owned  Was by giant Bob  Very similar to Vince McMahon  And Ted Turner  Why didn't Vince grab  Giant Bob?  Because Bob was making  All the money himself  Over there  He was making the yen  Right?  He was making all the yen  He was making the yen  Haystack Calhoun  Gorilla Monsoon  Who do you pick on his name?  No no it's who  Haystack Calhoun is  What do you think his name is?  Oh my  I don't know  Andres the giant  That's alright  Haystack Calhoun 
[03:09:30]  What's his name?  Haystack Calhoun  Haystack's Calhoun right?  Yeah  Or is it  Hey  What?  I think it's plural  Is it?  Oh yeah  Okay  Yeah  Jesus Christ  Unbelievable  I don't know  Who's winning the game?  It's an exciting Scrabble game  I think Rich is really  Kicking Jimmy's ass  225 to 89  What happened Jimmy?  Jimmy what's going on?  Are you just getting bad letters  Or are you stupid?  I have a seven letter word  I'm just debating  I'm trying to get a better one  Is this actually 
[03:10:00]  There is a Scrabble game  On the pay per view event  Unforgiven?  Is that true?  It's a  No we're  We're not mad at our fans  Why did you put it  Joking  That's a good one man  You're not  We got any wrestling questions  Out there on the bleachers  Oh my god  You know what though  I was in a beer drinking contest  One time on pay per view  And Stone Cold Steve Austin  Broke my nose  For real?  Yeah  In a beer drinking contest?  In a beer drinking contest  What happened?  You were winning  No he went to throw 
[03:10:30]  A pitcher of beer in my face  It was glass  And it slipped out of his hand  And hit me in the nose  And broke my nose  Holy shit  Wow  In a beer drinking contest  I had a broken back  He had a broken neck  They throw us no physicality  No matter what happens  And he breaks my nose  I feel like that's what's going to  Accidentally happen to me  After this interview  Yeah  Yeah  Oops  And a can of this  Goes flying at your face  I sent Steve a picture  The other day  Steve went to Michigan  Recently  And apparently he shot  Every deer in Michigan  Because he sent me  All these big butt pictures  And I was down in Texas 
[03:11:00]  And I had an opossum  In my garage  And I shot it  And I sent him a picture of it  Because that was  About the biggest thing  I've ever shot  Wow  A opossum?  A opossum  What did you shoot him with?  22  Okay  Jesus that story  Is like a verbal  Scrabble game  Nobody cares  I would just love to hear  The next thing out of Rich  Is this  As all the air  Leaves his lungs  Every time Rich speaks  We should go to commercial  I don't know  See Rich  That was good Mike 
[03:11:30]  You used that one already  I'm trying to get  Punch in the teeth  So I don't have to  Pay the $30,000  I'll punch in the teeth  Really?  You won't sue me though?  Yeah  I don't want to  Spend the $30,000  Yeah he's not going to sue?  What rhymes with sue?  Why don't you say it to JBL?  Instead of looking off to the side  I'm not saying anything  Look right into his eye  Look right  Huh?  And say that  Say what?  What you were saying  You were trashing him  I'm a big fan  Good luck with the soda pop  Soda pop 
[03:12:00]  With the sleepy soda  Good luck with your soda pop son  I think you got a future in this  I'm a big fan  You know what  I'm just trying to  I'm trying to do this  Wait wait  Wait why are you a big fan of JBL?  Because he's  One he's conservative  That's one  Okay  Two  He's  He's  He's a businessman  He goes after something  You wanted to say entrepreneur didn't you?  Yeah  Oh god  I can tell  Because he's not 
[03:12:30]  You know  He hires minorities  He's everything  That this country wants  He's everything  Oh god  Joe's taking a mic  It takes you so long to get out  Joe's got something  And when you get out  The thought  I'm like  It took that long  To that thought  Hey  I'm not a minority  Oh yeah  I'm not a loan officer either  I'm actually Italian  That was good  No  It wasn't  I'm not a loan officer either  You're getting fake laughs 
[03:13:00]  By the bouncer  By the way  I could actually probably do that Bronx tale scene a lot better than you did  Oh  By the way  I don't know  With those cocktail frying fingers  How do you pick up the letters?  Oh  How do I pick up the letters?  Yes  Now  When you're going with traffic  To the east side  Are you making fun of the fact that he's driving JBL?  No  I was feeling good about myself  Because I trashed Voss earlier  But then the driver trashes him  Yeah  He's good too 
[03:13:30]  Oh you really got me earlier  You've owed me 20 bucks for two months  What do I do?  We're going to go to commercial  But definitely pick up drank  And we'll be back in a few minutes  Oh no  Not at this  Unforgiven  His political issues are enough for me to be on his side  Like that  That's all  And obviously for the hunting story  You're a gun owner  You like what?  Target shooting?  Well no  I'm not talking to you  I believe in guns  I'm not talking to you  I say I like shooting more than I like hunting 
[03:14:00]  Yeah that's exactly what I am  I'm not like a hunter  I don't like hunting  But I love shooting  Love shooting  You have to leave the house  You know  I leave the house when I go  I go down to the range  I don't like going to the range  What state are you from?  Texas  Texas  Oh fuck you lucky bastard  You can just go into a drugstore and buy a gun  You know we got to go through in New York  It's a pain in the ass  Pain in the ass  But you know  We can carry concealed  Anthony there's one more thing we want to do with JBL 
[03:14:30]  As we promote his anti-energy drink  That's called drank  I love the packaging  I love the product  I love the idea behind it  What would you say the sexual orientation of the packaging would be if you were going to go one way or the other  I would say a fag  Okay  And no absolutely not  It's a calming color  That's what I've noticed  You might want to pour it into a cup  You don't want to be caught what carrying the can around  Yeah you might have poured in a cup because the color is calming  It makes you want to just lay your head on a pillow  Perhaps face first 
[03:15:00]  But it will make you sleepy  This is the color they paint bathhouses with  How would you know that Rich?  I couldn't leave the mic to my face first  Why would you do that to yourself?  That's a good one Rich  This tastes just like cum  But only on a Tuesday  Smooth Rich  Smooth  Could you pour it through a hole in one of the stall walls?  By the way Rich Ross will be at the Orange Julius in Worcester Massachusetts this weekend  I want to tell JBL this is the new thing  Anti-promotion 
[03:15:30]  So this is going to work for your product I'm telling you  Yeah  Trust us on this one  Anti-promotion, anti-energy I like it  Yeah  Come on here bash the product  Make people feel bad about buying it  I got it  One more thing I want to do with JBL  I like it  I like it too  I like the taste of it  Unforgiven  He can't help my career  Sunday, pay-per-view, WWE  The gay wrestling move Sam  I think we should play the real gay one for JBL  And get his opinion  We've noticed that some of the wrestling  The finishing moves are a bit gay  And we made Sam come up with the top five 
[03:16:00]  Top five gay finishing moves  Maybe we should ask JBL  He's been wrestling a long time  What's one of the gayer moves where you're like  I don't like that one being used on me  I don't like this one too much  Yeah  Stink face  The stink face was  Yeah  That was pretty bad  That's bad  Especially from what the asset came from  Yeah  That's a pretty awful move  That was where a guy would be in the corner  Pretty much knocked out  But not a guy  You're talking about a rikishi  Who had like a three ton ass  Yeah  So the victim is in the corner 
[03:16:30]  Pretty much groggy  Almost knocked out  And then Rashiki  With a huge giant ass  Would come over  And just put the guy's face  In the crack of his ass  And smear it around  Oh wow  Yeah  Yeah  Michael all of a sudden  Looked over at JBL  Like what the fuck  That's gay and experimental  Yeah  Is this the gayest one Sam  Yeah I think this is number one  Yeah JBL  Do you know these wrestlers  No I do not  They wrestle overseas Sam  Yeah they're from Japan  I think the guy's name is 
[03:17:00]  Dan Shoku Dino  And this is his  Dan Shoku driver  Dan Shoku driver  We'll explain after JBL sees  He's pulling his  I see he pulled  So he's pulled down his pants  And he's coming at him  Cock first  Yeah cock first  Now the guy's stuck in the corner  And his ass is showing  And then he shoves his  Gold thong right into the guy's face  Cock first  That's not all JBL  Then he opens up the G string 
[03:17:30]  Puts the guy's head in  He puts his head in  And then power drives his head to the mat  And does a little pile driver there  It's a  A pile driver  And then he pins him  With his dick on his face  Yeah JBL is stupefied  Now JBL  I know you love wrestling  But if Vince McMahon came to you  And said I got a good idea  I got some finishing moves  I've been watching in Japan  I don't want to try on you  In my office  That would have  Yeah that  How quickly would you leave wrestling  If they told you to do that move 
[03:18:00]  Pretty quick  As in right then  Yeah  Alright I got all your wrestlers  Together to tell you  It's boners in the mouth  For all of you  That's right  Boners in your mouth  Every finishing move  Has to consist  Of a boner in your mouth  Wrestling's like trying to  It's like being a coke addict  Alright stop the music  Stop the show  Stop everything  Stop the earth  Stop the bit  What was that  First of all  What's the coke addict

Yeah she's beautiful  Two for two  She's having a great year  She's the first one  That called the Citigroup debacle  She called it  Actually got a bunch  Of death threats over it  That thought she was wrong  And turned out  That she was dead right on it  Who's giving your wife  Death threats?  Jesus Christ 
[03:26:00]  Some guy gave her a death threat  From his home computer  So they found the guy  By the time he was sent  Before you did  Yeah  That would have been nice  Imagine him knocking on your door  You sent my wife an email  And just  I'm going to punch you  In the fucking face  She's getting death threats  Did you just  Keep her in the house  Kind of thing?  I mean what do you do  In that situation?  Not much you can do  You know I did stay in town  That weekend  Instead of going out  To work with the WWE  She got several  But then it turned out  That she was right about Citigroup  They ended up firing Chuck Prince 
[03:26:30]  The CEO at the time  Over what her report was  And then she became  Kind of the darling of Wall Street  Wow  Instead  They thought at first  She was just trying to make  A name for herself  Right  Wow  And turned out she was right  Those people who outed  The Enron folks  She called the Enron scandal  Before it happened  Did she really?  Yep  Sure did  Wow  Kreskin  She's had a great year  She's had a great career  But this year has been  Phenomenal for her  Great  Wonderful  She's actually  In the 50 most powerful  Women in the world list  She's probably funnier than Voss  Oh Vossy

Yeah yeah yeah  Do you know what Mick Foley's status is?  With the WWE  Because people are saying  His contract might be over  He might be jumping ship  My understanding is  His contract is over  He didn't like Vince McMahon  Yelling at him in the headsets  While he was producing him 
[03:52:30]  As the commentator  So Mick decided  He was going to do other things  I hear  And this is total rumor  That he's going to TNA  But I don't know that  That's total rumor  Uh oh  Well that'll be on  The rumor  Thank you  And Sam  What do you know about this?

Oh, you go fuck yourself  Where did Mike come?  You got an answer to that?  Where's Mike?  I don't know  Maybe he's in the bathroom  Visiting his career  But I pointed to him  Pointed in radio  Let's go to him  No, I didn't see no point  Did you hit it?  At Pancake House this weekend? 
[03:55:00]  No, I was just gonna say  Like  I don't even know  What it means  Literally  If I was visiting my career  Like, what would that entail?  It was shit  Oh, okay  Your career is shit  So you go to the bathroom  You kind of go  Back and forth  On like  What your joke is about me  Like, is my career going well?  Is it not going well?  Is it going too well?  Don't analyze it, Mike  You can't analyze it  You haven't kind of nailed down  What your joke is about me yet  I'll work on that with you  Do you have three kids?  No  Failure 
[03:55:30]  Failure  That's it  That's it  You're taking it out of context  That's the standard right there  You're taking it out of context  That's the barrier  That's the watermark  I got three kids  Therefore, I need to run the world  You and Sarah Palin  Are in the same boat  That means Sarah Palin  Should really be president  With five  Yeah, that's true  Four and a half  Are you laughing?  Is she going to Cleveland?  I never think about my career  Do you have this, Jim?  I never think about my career  As much as when I'm with Rich  He brings it up so much  I didn't bring it up once  You brought up mine  I didn't bring up your career once 
[03:56:00]  No, you brought it up over there  You're just like a fucking liberal  I swear to God  You twist everything  I never said one thing  About your fucking career  You said it about mine  No, I didn't say anything  I didn't say anything liberal  Let me tell you something  You were saying  Oh, you have a nice little career  I said I have a great life  No, I didn't say that  I said I had a great life  And a career is part of my life  That's it  End of story  I didn't talk about your  Dumb fucking career  I'm talking about my life  Now it's a dumb fucking career  Over at the other station  You were talking about my career  I didn't understand why  No, I was saying  What a fraud you are as a human

[03:58:00]  That's what I figured  I said  He probably did research  And figured this is  A calming color  JBL, this is a serious question  Do you put your name  On these products  Or are you behind  The product  Why don't you  Fucking read the cans  Stupid  I put my name on them  Not on Drank  Not on Mama Juana  But the new energy  Yeah, it's last name  Is Drank  Layfield's Energy Plus  So yeah  Wait, you're going to have  Another  It's my company  It's my company  I'm just endorsing it  Wait, you're going to have  Another drink coming out?

As compared  Oh  See, Rich  Thank you  I really bring out  The worst in people  You really do  I met the guy  For 10 minutes  Because JBL hated Mike before  He didn't like Mike before  Everybody's like that with Mike  But now he hates you more  Jesus  You've managed  To make them like you  That's how awful you were to them  United  You made them like each other  In hatred of you  Yeah  They're like fucking  Iran and Iraq  Against Syria  You need a globe

[04:06:00]  To help Voss recover  From a bad joke?  Barry wants to know that  Let me tell you something  About Voss  I've got to say this  Voss was fucking hilarious today  Of course  But, you know  When you're fighting  That many guys  Yeah  Everyone had really  Up and down moments  Like Birbiglia  Had moments where you  Murdered him  And he had some  Really caustic  Funny shit too  JBL obviously  But Birbiglia was  Smashing him earlier  Yeah  It was ugly between them  If you didn't jump in  Birbiglia probably  Would have gotten  Punched out of his shorts  Because fucking JBL 
[04:06:30]  Was stewing  Stewing  He was not happy  You think JBL was stewing?  When he said  Who are you?  No, but Birbiglia  Just kept throwing  Little jabs at him  And I gotta say  A true champion today  Was Roland  Who just came in here  And destroyed  He walked over  And just knocked  The  Fucking animal  No offense  But I was losing  A Scrabble game  I mean picture  I don't know  Picture a fucking  A slug  Beating you at a game  Where your mind is  No  I mean that 
[04:07:00]  No offense  You know  I was losing  A chess game  To a dodo bird  I play Scrabble  All the time  I don't care  But that anger  Came  That was  That was some  Deep rooted anger  That's Roland  Yeah  We learned that  I was gonna say  The hard way  But not the hard way  It just came out  Of nowhere one day  Roland doesn't play games  He doesn't play  And you know  It's so funny  Let me explain  About my career  Real quick  The next runner up  Line  Housewoman  Mayor  Governor 
[04:07:30]  Alright  She took her  Her state  That was in  A deficit  And now  She has  Their plus  Would they sell snow  He said their plus  Or  Yeah  Whatever  I started off  Good politically today  First 20 seconds man  Wow  Yep  Your problem is  Like you're a sprinter  And you want to run marathons  Yeah  Mmm  That's good  Excellent  Yeah  That definitely  That was a very good observation 
[04:08:00]  On my part  I wasn't going for a joke  It was an observation  Rich  Are you calling me later  No  Oh fuck yeah  Can I take a nap first  You're going to be  On the phone with him  I have California closets  Coming at noon  So don't call me  Right  Can't wait to walk out of them  Huh  I believe  Of course  Alright  Alright Rich  I'm giving you  A solid  A solid B  Solid B today  Alright  I know you want an A minus  I don't want anything

[04:09:00]  Why do you feel guilty  I just do  No  No  There's no reason to feel guilty  Because I don't know him yet  Oh really  You can't read through that  Fucking  No serious question  You really don't like Mike  No he's  It's not  Listen  I had no idea  Here's the deal  Hold on  What tipped you out  That he didn't like Mike  When he criticized  The way he behaved at a wake  You don't follow the widow  Rich wow  You don't follow the widow  That is a good point though  There's rules  You don't follow the fucking widow 
[04:09:30]  Because it's all self-serving  Because it's industry there  That's what it is  Basically he followed the eulogy  Is what you're saying  Whatever  Or the great Mitch Hedberg  Oh and now  We had you guys both booked today  We didn't know there was a problem  There isn't  It came from when he was getting booed  He tried to go after you  It's  You know what it is  It's just  That's reasonable though  I'm not even trying to like  Your play  Yeah  Now I understand where it came from  You know I've done  I've worked with this audience  And I've proven myself  Here's another runner up  Right of the day  JBL  I sure got off on the wrong foot  What does it stand for JBL 
[04:10:00]  Unforgiven  Jet Propulsion  It just means it's unforgiven  Is that what his name means?  No  It's the name of a  Propulsion  No  I said jet  Propulsion  Oh  I missed that  It was so bad  That I crashed it  Before it even came out of my mouth  Wow  But yeah  Danny laughed  That's all I care about  So anyhow  Here's the thing  You don't know him  You know him enough  You didn't go after 
[04:10:30]  And that's alright  That's how you  I'm not telling you how to run  You know  It's easy to go after me  But it makes you know  He leaves thinking  Hey I won  Or I destroyed  You beat him up pretty good  Early on bro  You know  Alright this is what I'm going to tell you  I think you beat Mike today  You lost to Roland  I got knocked out by Roland  JBL beat you  In probably a decision  Yeah  Who else did he take on today?  So you won  One out of the three fights 
[04:11:00]  No he didn't  The audience  I like  I'll tell you why I like Mike  For Big Lear  He's an evil motherfucker  And he doesn't come across as one  Like  Roland  He's an evil motherfucker  Do you think so?  Yeah  Yeah  I see  I see spinny eyes sometimes  Okay  His eyes start spinning  But when you take a crew  He's an evil motherfucker  Okay say you take like  Like tough guys  Say you take like  Myself  Patrice  Bobby  Colin  Norton  Do you see Mike in that crew?  Do you see Mike hanging out in that crew?  I mean we're  Obviously we're phasing out you guys 
[04:11:30]  And we're trying out Mike  No I'm not saying it  We can't be  Hanging with you guys  For 20 more fucking years  No no you don't get me  You gotta phase out  Don't get  Don't get me wrong  I'm not saying it has  Had nothing to do with you  It has something to do with  The type of comics  We hang out with  But I don't know where his place  Is going to be on the show  Or whatever  No it has nothing to do with the show  You guys got your place  I don't see like Regan  Hanging out with you guys either  Right  But Brian Regan's funny  So what I'm saying is  We're different types of people  Okay  And we're from different sides 
[04:12:00]  But that's what I like about this radio show  You bring in a bunch of different types of people  And it's perfect  I know there's a lot of people that don't like Mike  There's a lot of people out there that enjoy him  But what they really like is the confrontation  That we brought to the people today  And that was a different confrontation  Than you and Bob Kelly  Or you and Patrice going at it  There's like love when you guys are fighting  That was some good shit  That was some good shit today  A different type of confrontation  That's why I loved it  Just an evil show today  A lot of shit going back and forth  Starting with my stupid videotape 
[04:12:30]  And this wrestling guy  He got me with a couple of stocks  I guess for a wrestler  Rich I have something that  Roland fucking destroyed me  He came in and destroyed me  That was pre  Roland's an animal  Roland is an animal  He's probably the scariest person  That hangs around here  I mean when he jerked off this drink  Right here  I knew I was going to lose  At the end of killing Voss  Then he jerked off the drink  Like a big wrestling move  And then threw the can down and left  It was a perfect out and everything  It was fucking great  Here's another runner up line of the day 
[04:13:00]  Alright listen  We got to go  The Rich Voss pity party  Will be this weekend  In Worcester Massachusetts  Pity party  Pity party  We love you Rich  Listen  That's another thing  He comes in  Where the fuck  We love you  What  These guys come and go  Comics like this  Jesus Christ  Fucking come and go  140 yards out  5 mile an hour wind  Pin in the front

[04:15:00]  When JBL stood up  He hit the ceiling  When you want to make  That dramatic stand up  Move  You want to like  You know  Alright here's how  I'm going to call today  I got Mike  Roland got me  And that was a draw  JBL was not a draw  He beat you in a decision  I got him on some good ones  That's why I give you  A decision  You lost a decision  That's pretty good  Roland knocked you  Knocked you the fuck out  That's right  That came out of nowhere  That was a sucker punch  That came out of nowhere  He's not iconic dude  And you got Mike early on  And throughout this  I had some good ones  With Mike too 
[04:15:30]  But his are all the same  Do you like him?  Who Mike?  Listen  Do I like him as what?  Would I hang out with him?  No  I got nothing in comedy  As a homo sapien  Do I like his comedy?  No it does nothing for me  Do I like Patrice?  I think he's a great comic  Norton great  I hope that people  Heard the live show  Because we went so long  With no breaks  They're going to have to edit  The fuck out of this one  Another runner up line 
[04:16:00]  Of the day  And that purple  Fag fucking  Elixir that is  What is this shit?  Man  That was a little like  Oh what am I saying?
