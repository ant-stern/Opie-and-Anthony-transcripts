<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a tribute to Patrice O'Neal, featuring previously unreleased outtakes.  E-Rock hosted this segment, sharing memories of O'Neal's easygoing nature and humorous interactions during show breaks.  This transitioned into a segment featuring Keith "the cop," who brought in several homeless individuals for interviews.  The focus was on "Half a Hulk Face" Scott, a homeless man with severe facial deformities from tumors, who recounted his life on the streets, eviction, and numerous surgeries, including teeth removal.  The hosts and Keith engaged in often crude humor about Scott's appearance; Jose, another homeless individual, was mentioned but not interviewed.

The show then shifted to a discussion about a major US weather event, prompting listener calls from Dallas, Chicago, and Houston. This led to a broader conversation about natural disasters, including the possibility of a Yellowstone supervolcano eruption or a meteor strike.  Ryan Keighley, a guest, joined the discussion debating the plausibility of these scenarios with the hosts, referencing Michu Kaku’s views on Yellowstone. The conversation devolved into off-color jokes and speculation about genetically modified food and Monsanto, culminating in a sexually explicit description of a woman's physique by Opie.  A short Bill Burr clip praising Patrice O'Neal followed, leading into a segment analyzing and mocking contemporary country music.

This country music segment involved Opie, Anthony, and Patrice openly admitting their lack of understanding of the genre's lyrics and themes,  using crude and sexually explicit jokes and commentary.  Songs by Dierks Bentley, Garth Brooks, Tim McGraw, Brad Paisley (featuring Dolly Parton), Billy Currington, Trace Adkins, and Carrie Underwood were discussed with humorous misinterpretations.  Listeners called in with varying perspectives, some defending country music, others joining in the comedic misunderstanding.  This segment also included a significant tribute to Patrice O'Neal, with Kevin Hart joining in studio to share anecdotes, including a humorous story about catching Patrice masturbating in Opie's apartment.  Patrice's death was discussed as a significant loss.

A phone conversation with Patrice O'Neal followed, featuring insults exchanged with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton.  The conversation focused on Patrice’s reaction to Kevin Hart’s “Three Kings and a Heart” comedy tour,  expressing a mixture of pride and jealousy.  The conversation included numerous racial slurs and offensive jokes.  Humorous and shocking anecdotes were recounted, including Patrice being caught masturbating in Jim Norton's apartment and his own garage while his wife was present;  comparisons of Kevin Hart's penis size to the hosts’; and numerous racist and offensive jokes.  Past comedic "hack courts" featuring Patrice, Kevin Hart, and Jim Norton were discussed, as was a legendary "bus beating" incident involving Bill Burr and Jim Norton.  Patrice recounted experiences with poor service from people of Asian descent, leading to comedic rants.  The segment concluded with Patrice agreeing to meet Jim Norton.

A further tribute to Patrice O'Neal followed, with Chris Rock and other guests sharing anecdotes about his stage presence and contentious relationships.  Racial dynamics in comedy, including tipping habits and racial representation on television, were discussed.  A lengthy, profane segment with Pat Cooper included reminiscing about his career and expressing opinions on the comedy scene, criticizing Joan Rivers and Tony Bennett. Chris Rock seemingly conducted an impromptu intervention for one of the hosts regarding their behavior and career choices.  The segment touched on the challenges faced by comedians, including low pay and poor working conditions, with personal stories and reflections on Patrice O'Neal’s life and legacy.

The show concluded with more from Pat Cooper, whose rambling, profane anecdotes dominated the conversation.  He discussed his career, disdain for certain aspects of the entertainment industry, and confrontational personality, recounting stories of alienating people.  He boasted about his success and independence, making bigoted remarks about Black people.  More tributes to Patrice O’Neal were included, with Jim Norton sharing graphic and humorous anecdotes about trips to Brazil with O’Neal.  The conversation shifted to aging, mortality, and physical and mental changes associated with getting older.  The hosts discussed a photo of a younger, thinner Cooper, leading to more self-deprecating and offensive commentary from Cooper.  Finally, the movie "Back to the Future" and its time travel plot device were briefly mentioned.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Ah, here it is.  Welcome to a tribute to Patrice O'Neill.  Some of our favorite moments from the late comedian's history on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, it's E-Rock and welcome to, I guess you could call it part two, volume two.  Pretty much like a bonus show for all the Patrice O'Neill material we have on the Opie and Anthony show  that we didn't fit into the original 16-hour tribute that we did earlier.  In this show, we should have a bunch of stuff that are not only fan favorites, 
[00:00:30]  but favorites to people here at the show.  Hopefully, if there was something that we missed last time, hopefully we got it here.  Try to give Patrice the respect and the tribute that he deserves.  Patrice, I mean, I can't do this any justice like his real close friends, the comics, have,  but I always loved Patrice on the show.  Patrice was an amazing individual.  I knew whenever we had Patrice coming in that it was going to be an easy show in the sense that 
[00:01:00]  not necessarily he would do all the heavy lifting, but we wouldn't have to do much with Patrice on the show  because you just gave him anything and he could go in every direction,  no matter what topic you were talking about.  And then we'd just ride out the show with Patrice's thoughts.  And they were always the most fun shows, too.  Not to take anything away from the comics that we had on during the announcement of his death, 
[00:01:30]  but it just goes to show to have all that talent in studio and it would take that and if not more  to match the presence that Patrice would have in studio and when on the show.  You needed all those people just to come close to what Patrice brought to the table.  I loved talking to him during the breaks.  We'd talk wrestling.  He'd make fun of my hair or my outfit or whatever I was doing. 
[00:02:00]  And I've babbled long enough with this.  So let's get this started with more of a retrospective of the late, great Patrice O'Neal.  Remembering Patrice O'Neal, his greatest moments on ONA.  Keith is here.  Keith the cop.  We're getting ready for the homeless shopping spree.  I think we're still doing the homeless shopping spree, aren't we?  Oh, boy.  Oh, we're not doing the homeless shopping spree?  We'd better be.  Oh, okay.  We had better be.  Is he part of the scariest looking...  I'm trying to be mature about this guy's face, man, but this is like shit.  All right, what the... 
[00:02:30]  Can we get a picture of that guy's face?  Absolutely.  Oh, my God, man.  What is wrong with that guy?  It looked like he was getting ready to turn into a werewolf, but just stopped.  Does that a gunshot wound?  Something obviously happened.  No, I think it's just natural.  Some kind of natural...  That's natural?  That shit could happen to you?  That's like the elephant man thing.  That's why I don't like seeing this stuff, man.  That's what I'm saying.  It looked like he was almost the Hulk, but he just stopped being mad right before he  was going to...  He was just like...  Ah, never mind.  He's the Hulk when he's just a little bit disturbed. 
[00:03:00]  Mr. McGee, don't make me angry.  I'm...  All right.  Just letting you know where my face could go, motherfucker.  That's the Hulk just a little agitated.  A little agitated Hulk.  Like his breakfast order was...  It's a little agitated Hulk.  Like his breakfast order, he wanted egg whites, they gave him the entire egg.  So he's just a little pissed off.  Yeah, isn't someone trying to kill him?  Nah.  Or, you know, he's got to lift a car off of somebody.  It's like, yeah.  That's a little road rage.  I wanted black coffee.  They put sugar in this. 
[00:03:30]  It's a little road rage.  All of a sudden, someone cut him off, and he's like...  And then the moment passed.  You know, you've got to get to work.  Just to let you know, I am almost a Hulk face.  Holy crap.  It obviously is...  He looks great when he turns to the side.  Oh, my God, man.  It's disturbing.  This is not fucking fair.  Patrice, look.  When he turns to the side, he's fine.  I've seen the motherfucker.  It's just like...  He's like...  It's like some kind of bone thing.  Oh, no.  You know what it is? 
[00:04:00]  You ever see the Hulk, the original series?  Yeah.  And it's just a monster within.  And it's David Banner.  Half of his face.  Oh, they showed half and half.  And the other face is...  Yeah, yeah.  That's him.  Half a Hulk face.  That's his...  That's his Monica.  What is that?  Do you know, Keith?  Yeah, it's a natural thing.  I mean, you...  It's a natural thing?  What is it, Keith?  You've got to ask him when he comes in.  There's nothing natural about that.  He has no problem talking about it.  It's a kind of bone thing.  All right.  And he's homeless?  I think it's like your bones kind of grow.  Oh, the guy whose face is melting. 
[00:04:30]  Who's he?  That's Scott.  What's his deal?  He's one of the Port Authority homeless guys.  All right.  All Port Authority guys, huh?  And then we have Jose.  Jose?  He was a...  I don't think you guys got to play that interview.  Oh, Jose, yes.  We didn't get to it because we got in so much problems.  Well, what does Jose do?  He's just fucking crazy.  All right.  Yeah, let's hear it.  Okay.  Jose, the homeless guy that Keith, the cop, found and brought in with half a Hulk face. 
[00:05:00]  Half a Hulk.  Half a Hulk.  That's horrible.  That's horrible.  Dude, right now he's eating an egg sandwich outside the studio.  Oh, shit.  I'm not looking.  And all I want to yell is, swallow.  Swallow.  Oh, no.  Oh, he looks like a boxing pelican.  Like a pelican with a bed.  A pelican.  A pelican that just got punched in the jaw. 
[00:05:30]  Just, just, just.  That's like what you were talking about with the plane.  His face is cantered.  It's cantered.  Motherfucker.  That thing is cantered, man.  It's cantered.  You can't land that face.  You can't land that face.  If a pilot was looking at that face, he'd be like, folks, we're dead.  We're dead as motherfucker.  Because this shit is too cantered.  I can't wait to get that guy in.  Boy.  That was half a Hulk face's story, right?  That's what he did. 
[00:06:00]  See, I just stopped.  Go get the Opie and Anthony wig out.  I want to see how far we can push this guy.  Oh, no.  We found your wife.  All right.  Here we go.  We'll take a quick break, Ant.  We'll talk to half a Hulk face next.  In studio, Patrice O'Neal.  Keith the Cop stopped by with a few of our homeless friends.  We're getting ready to interview half a Hulk face.  And, man, we're learning a lot about half a Hulk face.  Yeah.  First of all.  All secondhand.  First of all, someone threw him an apple today thinking, hey, man, he's hungry, right? 
[00:06:30]  Guy goes, dude, I can't eat an apple.  I don't have teeth.  Holy shit.  Found that out.  And then we found out this other thing.  He helped out the police once with an attempted homicide in the shelter.  One of these homeless guys went up to another one with a meat cleaver and hacked it into the back of his head.  And no one came forward except half a Hulk face.  And that's when I thought, wow, maybe he had a real fine face before he turned into a snitch.  That's what happened. 
[00:07:00]  Brad Pitt and he snitched down and they worked him over.  No, no.  Now, you sure nobody is going to know I'm snitching?  Absolutely half a Hulk face.  Half a Hulk face.  What we've done is we've lit the area in a special way where they can only see you in silhouette.  So they will not know who you are as you testify.  Well, I saw a guy run up to, is that half a Hulk face, nigga?  Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
[00:07:30]  I'm looking behind this nigga snitching on me, right?  Half his face is on.  That's half a motherfucking Hulk face snitching on me.  How you know?  Nigga, look at your silhouette.  Half your silhouette is fucked up.  You're not going to be half a Hulk face anymore.  I'm going to even out that motherfucker.  I'll be whole Hulk face after this.  Might as well paint yourself green now, motherfucker.  Well, I've got to find out his story. 
[00:08:00]  All right, let's get him in here, man.  Half a Hulk face.  Half a Hulk face entering the studio.  Shit.  There he comes.  Don't be offended if I can't do it too long.  There he comes.  Take a seat there, my friend.  What's up, bro?  What's up, man?  Put on them headphones, and we've got to get to the bottom of this.  How you doing?  Good.  What's your name, man?  Scott.  Scott, move up to the mic just a little.  There you go.  Scott?  Yep.  Now, you're a homeless gentleman? 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  What happened?  Basically, don't talk to my family.  They're a bunch of bastards, so they can kiss my ass.  The only people that actually kind of help me out are all my friends.  Yeah, but you had a home at some point, right?  Well, I was living in California.  Hosting The Tonight Show.  Fuck, Jay Leno.  I'm teasing, of course.  But you lived in California.  Oh, yeah.  Here comes the photoshops. 
[00:09:00]  And then...  Holy shit, Jay Leno.  But you had a home.  Yeah.  All right.  What happened that made you homeless?  I basically...  After my mother passed away.  You know, basically...  God damn it.  A little advice.  Mom, stop passing away.  Yeah, it seems like a lot of the mother thing going on a lot.  So, your mom passed away.  Both of my sisters were older.  They had their family.  So, I just packed up my things and left.  And left without any place to go?  Well, I had a place.  But then my landlord evicted me. 
[00:09:30]  He wanted to raise the rent, so...  And you were in New York at this time?  Yeah.  So, you just ended up evicted, out on the streets.  Pretty much.  And that was how long ago?  Two, two and a half years.  Two and a half years.  Yeah.  So, it hasn't been that long for you.  No.  But you've been on the street the whole time since then?  Off and on.  I stay in a bullshit hotel, paying about what...  I love the bullshit.  It's over there by the asshole arms.  Yeah.  So, you stay in the bullshit hotel. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  And what, for how much a night?  It's, what, $120 a week.  $120 a week?  You got rats everywhere.  Cockroaches everywhere.  How do you make the $120 a week?  Any way I can.  Yeah?  You got to...  Wait, let's get into that.  Side job or...  Hey, hey, hey.  Nothing perverted now.  What?  No, I'm just asking how you make your money.  Any way you can, so that...  I go to day labor.  Day labor.  Yeah.  There you go.  You get up enough to keep a roof over your head occasionally. 
[00:10:30]  What do you do in the cold?  Same thing.  Yeah?  Just try to make enough money to stay in the hotel.  Pretty much.  Yeah.  But that homeless life is a bitch.  That it is.  Jesus Christ.  Now, we got to ask you, what kind of medical anomaly do you have going for yourself there?  It's a tumor.  It's a tumor.  It's not a tumor.  It's a tumor.  Is it one tumor?  Well, the predominant ones on my face.  Right.  But then there's other ones? 
[00:11:00]  Smaller ones.  Smaller ones.  Yeah.  And what are they like?  Can they be removed or...  The one on my face, I've had, what, 12 surgeries since I was probably me five years old.  Get out of here.  Growing up, the doctor's excuse was, the reason why they couldn't take it out, was they felt  if they took out the whole tumor, that they would have pinched one of my facial nerves,  which would have caused me to be paralyzed.  Goodbye facial nerves.  Yeah, right? 
[00:11:30]  Take my facial nerve out of this moment.  Isn't that kind of a trade-off, maybe?  Yeah.  But as I got older, once medical science got actually better, you know, the doctor said  that those nerves had been gone for years.  Right.  You kind of, yeah, see, because your mouth...  Yeah.  Botox, anyway.  The Botox kills nerves.  So they could have taken it out then?  Yeah, but it was all a money issue, which it is today.  It's all a money issue.  They would be able to take that out? 
[00:12:00]  Well, yeah.  If I had, let's say, two, three million dollars, easily.  Two to three million?  Well, that sounds like it's pretty expensive.  Well, the last surgery, major surgery I had, it ran well over close to 500 grand.  That's a $500,000 face you got?  Yep.  Holy shit.  And what did they do?  Um, the last major one, what they did was, the tumor was about maybe two inches away  from my esophagus. 
[00:12:30]  So they had to go in there, you know, basically cut out most of the tumor, do like a, they  did a skin gram on the lower part of my right leg.  Ow.  To basically hold the skin up so that way it wouldn't affect my breathing.  If I didn't have that surgery, I would have been dead already.  Wow.  That is some fucked up shit.  What?  Now, does Eric Stoltz ever call you and get mad that you're stealing his act? 
[00:13:00]  How much's the money from him now?  He stole my idea.  Yeah.  You don't have a map with a lot of pins on it, do you?  Jeepers.  Creepers.  Do you have Sha'a's phone number?  Right.  Yeah.  That must, uh, yeah, it must be hard.  You don't have someone getting ready to put some pins back in a drawer somewhere.  It's got, it's got to be rough, right?  You know, I walk around, goddamn fucking kids pointing at you and shit.  It's got to be rough.  What is this?  What do you mean?  It's got to be rough. 
[00:13:30]  It's got to be rough.  It is rough.  It's got to be.  There's no question about it.  Nigga, if some of your hand was on the left side of the other hand, like, if you had  a pinky that was turned to the left off your hand, people go, oh, jeez, man, what the fuck  happened?  His face is like a broken baseball player's hand.  Right.  It's on the left.  It's a half a Hulk.  Hulk, right.  Yeah.  It's a half a Hulk.  And because of money issues, there's nothing you can do about it.  Nope. 
[00:14:00]  Man.  Nothing.  You better be able to sing.  Shit.  Gray Wolf can sing and ain't nothing wrong with his face.  Nope.  No.  Chance ain't worth a lick.  And you can't eat apple?  Nope.  No teeth.  God damn.  You have no teeth?  What happened to the teeth?  Did that happen?  The surgery they did last year, the surgery they did last year, the surgery they want to do  now is that they want to take out the whole tumor.  That's a good suggestion.  Well, yeah.  That'd be a good start.  Well, but the tumor will actually grow back.  Why?  Because...  That's a chia tumor. 
[00:14:30]  Fucking guy got a tumor.  You know what?  Pretty much.  The tumor itself, you know, it's like a grapevine.  The more you pluck off, the more that's going to come back.  So the reason why they removed all my teeth was they actually got a sense of, once they  removed the tumor, as I got older, the tumor actually stopped, you know, caused the right  side of my jaw to grow out of place.  Uh-huh.  So they actually got to break my jaw, you know, and actually reset it so my jaw's going 
[00:15:00]  to be wired shut for, I don't know how long.  Good God.  Wow.  And who pays for this?  The state.  Taxpayers.  Taxpayers?  No.  Oh, fuck it, man.  Jesus, taxpayers.  Pay for it, basically.  I don't care if taxes are going or that, that's fine by me.  Yeah, exactly, man.  Fucking...  I'd rather do that than some stupid program that teaches kids some stupid thing in school  they ain't going to use.  Yeah, man.  Help me.  Fix the guy's face.  This guy's face is like...  Damn, bro.  Poor guy.  What's your nickname with all your buddies? 
[00:15:30]  They got to have a nickname for you.  They call me Scott.  They just call you Scott?  No, come on.  You've heard the names.  What do they call you there, Scott?  No.  All my friends respect me.  Yeah.  I mean, of course, you can have some assholes who make fun of me, but...  Not assholes.  Your friends are going to...  Look, if I grew up in the hood with a face like that, they would call me, you know, twisty  or come here, give me a kiss or...  You know what I mean?  Or something.  Something.  Twist.  But that's your friends.  Friends got to tease you.  I'm a fat motherfucker.  People don't call me... 
[00:16:00]  I did a fat joke today.  You did a fat joke on me today.  Well, I'm...  But I...  You know, growing up, people called me...  People who love you, dude.  Not people who go, I'll point at you, but people who go, hey, man, you coming out?  Let's go to the club.  Well, uh, you know...  My friend...  Stroke?  No.  Those friends call me Scott.  Yeah.  Fuck.  All my friends treat me as a person.  But you had some assholes that called you names.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Growing up, we had people that called me Logjaw, Elephant Man, you know, shit like that.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:16:30]  Which I got in plenty of fights over, you know, growing up.  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  Jesus.  Unbelievable.  That's something.  That is some...  And what's going on with the ear?  The ear is part of the whole thing?  Well, yeah.  You know, it caused my right ear to be disfigured.  Yeah.  And dropped.  It's dropped, too, right?  Yep.  Because of the fucking tumor.  Jesus.  Can I get rid of that tumor?  That shit's crazy, dude.  And then it'll just grow back.  Yeah.  I mean, the tumor itself is hereditary on my mother's side of the family.  But the only two people that's really affected by it is me and my cousin Eric. 
[00:17:00]  He had one groin on the lower part of his back.  He had two surgeries.  Then the tumor bursted.  So they actually had to go in there and do emergency surgery, you know, in order to clean everything out.  Huh.  Huh.  Huh.  The tumor burst.  Jesus.  That can happen? 
[00:17:30]  Yep.  Could it happen to you?  So this is Christmas.  Happy holidays, everyone.  Ain't this a bitch?  Well, you know, growing up, the doctors told my parents straight out that I wouldn't live to see my 16th birthday.  Uh-huh.  They figured sooner or later, the tumor would kill me.  I'm 31 now, so I outlived the doctor by 15 years.  Yeah.  Shit.  How would it kill you?  Just grow into your brain or something?  Well, it's actually...  At this point, you've got to be cursing the doctor.  Well, actually, it's actually started at the back of the head, you know, near the brain. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  So it starts off at the back, and it's working its way forward.  So it's working its way forward.  Is it eventually going to, like, take over the other half of your face or something?  No.  Yeah, when does it get birthed?  Just that half?  Yeah, just that half.  And will it go into your brain?  All right.  Can we get the crazy guy in here?  Wow.  He's starting to freak me out.  Oh, that guy's dancing.  He's, like, fighting imaginary people and stuff.  Do you know that guy?  Quagmire from Family Guy.  Hey, giggity, giggity.  He's doing a giggity, giggity. 
[00:18:30]  Hey, giggity, giggity.  All right, well, you're going to go on the homeless shopping spree?  Sure.  Very cool.  All right, Scott.  We're going to just connect you, Scott.  Let's get the other guy in real fast.  Hang around, though, man.  You need anything?  You all set?  All right, cool.  He told you what he needs.  He needs fucking...  $3 million, motherfucker.  For the surgery.  That's what he needs.  Oh, my God.  The ear is stretched.  Did you see the ear?  The ear is on the bottom.  Tell him, it's just...  Yeah, you can do it.  Come on.  The ear is down on his neck. 
[00:19:00]  Half a Hulk is, like...  Remembering Patrice O'Neal, his greatest moments on ONA.  Got a good crew in here today.  We got Big Mama Prods on Twitter.  Patrice O'Neal, who's playing the Houston Improv.  But the problem is, I didn't know this.  Dallas got close to a foot of snow today.  That doesn't happen, right?  Dallas?  They don't get snow like that, do they?  Yeah.  Well, no.  No.  Dallas?  Every once in a while? 
[00:19:30]  It may be.  So Houston's getting hit as well, I believe.  But Patrice's problem is the ice storm we're going to have in New York tonight and tomorrow.  We're going to have one of those classic ice storms.  Yeah, I might not be able to get out of here.  No fucking way.  I mean, you know, I might still be able to make it.  There's a 1,500, a 2,000 mile weather swath across the whole United States right now.  This thing is supposed to be, they said 200 million people will be affected by this storm.  Yeah, yeah.  It's crazy.  It's brutal.  Chicago's supposed to get three inches an hour.  And we're going to get like, how many hours? 
[00:20:00]  I don't know.  Only for five minutes.  Look, we're on all over the country.  I want someone from Dallas and Chicago.  I want to know what the hell's going on with the weather.  I want someone from Houston to let me know if I'm going to get out of here tomorrow.  Let's do a call from Houston, Chicago, and Dallas.  How's that?  Yeah.  How can people not believe in God when shit like this happens?  It's just random.  It makes me believe in science and global warming.  Science.  Not global warming.  No, I don't believe in global warming.  Really?  The idea that this force, no matter how much we try to control it, it's unstoppable.  We're pompous as beings. 
[00:20:30]  We really think we have a lot more power than we do.  So we're like one flick, one little flick away from just non-existence.  I'm going to tell you what the ultimate arrogance is of everything I've ever heard in terms  of science is people that predict the end of the sun.  Like 2012?  Like the sun will extinguish in 7 million.  Shut the fuck.  It could go tomorrow.  The sun could sneeze.  It can't go tomorrow.  No, it can't go tomorrow.  Not scientifically.  It could sneeze and fucking in this globe. 
[00:21:00]  How do you know there couldn't be some kind of instability deep in the sun that just  all of a sudden explodes the motherfucker?  Well, maybe.  It's a reactor.  We have to go with what we know about stars.  And excuse me, fucking Bill Nye.  She, you're loving that job.  This is the thing.  We all repeat.  This is, we, and no, we all do it.  Repeat what someone else did and go, oh no, this is what it is.  I don't think I, a Nova, knows what's going on.  Personally, that's PBS.  Do you think every time, do you think every time a sun explodes, a star explodes? 
[00:21:30]  I'm not just trusting no black physics.  Too many people have said the same thing.  Yeah.  Too many people have said the same thing.  Every time a star explodes, it had this natural progression that lasted this amount of time.  Or do you think sometimes a star just goes, fuck it, and it explodes?  No, I don't think stars don't fuck it.  It's like Krypton's sun.  Krypton's sun said fuck it.  You ever throw an apple up in the air and it went, fuck it, before it hit the ground and  floated?  No.  No, it obeys the laws of physics.  That's fair. 
[00:22:00]  That's a very fair point.  Yeah, it is.  That is a very fair point.  But I think gravity on Earth is a little more dependable than a nuclear reaction that's  happening in space.  And we live in.  Based on a fuel supply.  Sure, but there's a difference.  You're right.  So it might not be five billion years.  It might be six billion years before the sun expands and then explodes or implodes.  It's not going to be a, it's going to be a fucking.  You've never seen it.  I have so.  I saw it in a jersey one time and I looked at it and nobody believed me.  We're still arguing about like dinosaurs and all that ass shit. 
[00:22:30]  We don't know shit.  We don't argue.  Only religious people argue.  Yeah.  Only the dummies.  Only the fucking strict religious people.  And we, people, you know.  And we shouldn't be worried about weather.  We should be worried about that Yellowstone thing.  What?  The big fucking volcano underneath?  That's way worse than any fucking storm.  Fucking Old Faithful's getting ready to explode.  And supposedly it would take out what?  Most of the United States?  It's building up pressure like an atomic bomb.  That's way worse than a stupid nor'easter or a clipper system. 
[00:23:00]  A cute Old Faithful could kill us all very soon.  A cute Old Faithful.  Fuck worrying about the weather and that dumb sun.  It could crash at Earth.  There's something bubbling right now under Yellowstone that could take out the United  States.  I thought they just put a fucking rock over it.  Enough already.  Stop looking at it.  Your boy Kwaku?  Oh, Kaku.  Kaku said the Earth moved.  He's so excited about what can happen at Yellowstone.  I've had 0.4 inches of some shit after this last, it was a big earthquake in Columbia,  I think.  It's not that unnatural, though, during earthquakes for the Earth to give a little shake. 
[00:23:30]  Are we far enough east to not worry about the Yellowstone?  That's all I want to know.  I love living on the East Coast.  I've never, this snow right now is the only time I've ever felt like, wow, Mother Nature  could put a match on us.  But other than that, the East Coast is a very great place to live.  Yeah, we really don't get it.  Hurricanes weaken before they get up here, really.  Really?  Snowstorms, eh, you know, we're not going to get a fucking ice age.  But we don't get earthquakes, we don't get tornadoes, you know, we get these little ones. 
[00:24:00]  I don't know, snow totally sucks.  But it doesn't make me not going to fuck you up.  It doesn't make me believe in, Patricia doesn't make you believe in God, no, it doesn't.  It's just a natural reaction.  What made me believe in God was when a Russian girl had me on my stomach, and she was gently  masturbating me, and she put a finger in my ass, and I went, no, no.  And before weight came out, I was coming.  That made me believe in God.  I thought I knew something, but the seer of all spoke through her middle finger, and 
[00:24:30]  I listened.  He said, come, my son.  By the way, we got Ryan Keighley in studio as well.  That's the other voice you heard.  Michu Kaku was talking about Yellowstone, and this guy saw the interview.  Chris in Jersey, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Welcome aboard.  Oh, thank you.  On CNN.com, there's an interview with him where he actually talks about it, and it's  called Yellowstone Takes a Deep Threat, and they show a diagram of the United States, and  I think most of fucking California is gone, and all the way until, I don't know exactly 
[00:25:00]  where it goes, but it's like the entire United States is destroyed.  No, no, I think we're safe, because we're way tucked away.  Yeah, come on.  As far east as you can go, that's where we're running.  The snow we're having now is just to say, hey, east coast, you can get fucked with,  too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because we don't get fucked with.  There's no fault lines.  There's none of that bullshit we got to worry about.  That's why there's so many of us here.  Fucking, why do you think in Jersey everybody's crammed up each other's asses?  We're not going to fall into the ocean. 
[00:25:30]  We're trying to push away from Yellowstone.  The Canary Islands.  Uh-oh.  That's where all these fucking snitches go.  Dude, the Canary Islands, and, you know, let me know if I'm right or wrong here, Ryan.  The Canary Islands will be falling into the ocean soon, and so much of it will fall in  the ocean, that it could be a giant tsunami that hits America from the energy of the Canary 
[00:26:00]  Islands.  I will deal with that.  Uh, falling into the ocean.  Now, what's wrong with the Canary Islands?  Is that they're going to fall into the fucking ocean?  Because they have, here's what they have, a series of volcanoes all through the shit.  Was it east or west coast that they would hit?  It was, it's us.  It needs to be on the science channel.  So, but I'm saying, it's interesting.  It's really, I'm just repeating what I saw.  It could be a lie.  They said, but there's volcanoes and water.  Ah, right.  So, so the water is constantly hitting the lava and making this, making the process of 
[00:26:30]  carving out shit like the, like the Grand Canyon took forever to finish carving.  This shit is carving because it's heat and pressure.  And, and they saying that that all that shit could just make the side of that island fall  right into the ocean.  I saw that.  I saw that.  But the island only comes up a little bit.  It doesn't come that much out of the water.  The earth going underneath.  Oh, really?  Building mountains.  But wouldn't that just make something else pop up?  Yeah, mountains.  It just makes something pop up.  It just makes something pop up.  It says it's, the threat is overhyped. 
[00:27:00]  Overhyped.  BBC.  Canary Islands aren't going anywhere.  Very fair to them.  I like, I like, I like, I like Goddamn Ryan.  Cause she, she, if you're ever going to quote news, quote, quote the BBC.  BBC.  The BBC.  By the way, the guy spreading the, the guy spreading the Canary Island thing owns a stilts  company in the Canary Islands.  And he's trying to get canaries for stilts.  Stilts?  And he's trying to prop them up onto the island.  When was the last time stilts were sold to anybody?  Canary stilts.  Stilts.  I think I bought these stilts. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, he's got everybody over there investing in stilts to prop up the island.  This is the first time in my whole life, and I live in Boston, so we get those Nor'eases  all the time, but this is the first time in my life as a man, I'm, I go, I'm going  outside going, ooh, like, yeah, mm.  Ooh.  And then having shitty conversations with the neighbors.  I was like, ooh, how about this, huh?  Did you hear?  I didn't realize that it.  Nothing worse than shitty conversations with the neighbors. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, the shitty snow cover.  Oh, look at the weather we're having.  You gotta say something cause you live next to them.  Never.  Ever.  I don't speak to my neighbors.  Good for you, man.  And I, cause I, I refuse to be the one that's not speaking.  Like, I, like, you're not speaking to me either, so fuck you.  So, we're not speaking.  Good news for the East Coast.  The Yellowstone thing, when it blows.  Won't hit us.  Won't hit us, but the ash will.  That's fine.  We'll be buried under a lot of fucking shit.  I don't care.  The people in my luxury building will clean it.  Clean the ash, scum.  When the meteor hits.  Lots of ash.  The ash doesn't really bother you at all. 
[00:28:30]  Nah.  Ash.  What do you think it's going to be?  You think it's going to be the sun?  What's going to kill us?  Yeah, it's going to be, it's going to be us, right?  I think it's going to be Monsanto.  It's going to be nukes.  No, because George Carlin did that bit about, uh, uh, plastic plus earth.  Like, the earth is just very adept at saying, go fuck yourself.  No, what takes our threats?  What takes us out, though?  I think the earth.  Genetic engineering.  No.  The earth.  I think of a devastating earthquake, a tsunami.  That takes the whole world out?  That does something. 
[00:29:00]  Could be a crazy fucking meteor strike.  Yeah.  I don't believe in meteors, though.  How do you not believe in meteors?  They're not a myth.  No, I don't believe that there is a destroying earth.  You should believe in meteors.  I think a big rock.  As a matter of fact, there's another theory that I don't believe.  That if they fire the giant stop you meteor nuclear missile, that it won't destroy it.  I believe it will destroy it.  The idea that a missile hits that meteor, a nuclear missile hits that meteor. 
[00:29:30]  You see what a fucking nuclear missile did to the Independence Day mothership.  Yes, I get it.  It will fucking blow that bitch up.  No, well, what would happen if it was fragmented?  It would fragment it.  And pieces of it.  What they're going to do with it is they're going to set it off in front of it or next  to it.  So the shockwave right at the beginning, when it's far enough away, diverts it.  So if you're 20 million miles away or 10 million miles away and you divert it, then the path  changes and it misses earth.  They're not going to blow it up.  They can't blow it up.  And we need about 50 years of warning or some shit, too, to have a chance to try to stop 
[00:30:00]  it.  What they're actually going to do is put somebody out there with a flag pointing in a different  direction so the meteor turns.  I don't think a meteor would destroy the earth.  I don't think there's a dinosaur destruction fucking meteor.  I think it's going to be fucking with our food supply.  I think it's eventually going to poison us.  And I think that, you know, us.  Well, yeah, what they're doing with corn right now.  You think we're going to fuck with corn?  I think we're going to kill ourselves with genetically engineered corn and meat and all that.  Yeah, Monsanto, yeah, that'd be good. 
[00:30:30]  Because you mess up that food supply, then where do we get food?  They're already genetically engineering.  But Monsanto's trying to control food.  But they're doing that to try to kill us anyway.  And their strains are like taking over natural occurring strains.  And then these strains also are not germinating without, you know, new seeds being purchased.  The goddamn Germans got nothing to do with it.  So you're into the New World Order and all that stuff.  I'm not in the New World Order.  Well, that's what you're talking, lovely.  Okay, Monsanto's a little bit different than Monsanto. 
[00:31:00]  Monsanto is all a part of it.  Who do you think made your tits?  Exactly when you guys are ruining the earth.  It's just going to be you and your tits, your bones and your titties, killing us.  Do you know that we stopped degrading in the ground, too, because of all the preservatives in our food?  That creeps me out.  That people are opening up graves and there's completely fucking preserved people in the ground because of Twinkies and shit like that. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, mummies did it, too.  We're not going to end.  That was a whole process.  We're going to colonize.  We're eventually going to colonize in space.  And we're going to eventually become more mobile.  Where are we going to colonize in space?  To where?  Thank you.  Where are we going to, like...  Moons of Jupiter they're looking at?  Okay, yeah.  Europa has a minor, minor chance of actually having life on it.  Yeah, Europa is one of the moons of Jupiter.  And the ice there isn't even made out of, you know, what we think of as something that would make ice and water.  I like the fuck you with an encyclopedia on top of your head.  It's a chemical slurry.  It's just like, I would love to fuck her while she's reading an encyclopedia. 
[00:32:00]  It's not lying.  They will eventually colonize other places.  How about we just planet transform fucking Mars?  It's because CO2 atmosphere.  That's what you heard.  You heard that shit from Total Recall.  No, no.  That shit don't have nothing.  No, but it's CO2.  So, you CO2, trees breathe CO2 and let off oxygen.  That's what they're saying!  So, over years, you make Mars an oxygen atmosphere.  Mars ain't got nothing but red rocks.  Yeah, and the trees would die if you'd strap them to the outside of the fucking ship and take off. 
[00:32:30]  Mars ain't shit.  It's so hard to get to Mars.  Why would we ever go to fucking Jupiter on the fucking moon, where Jupiter's nothing but a giant, deadly gas ball?  And then how do you get your sunlight, like you're behind Jupiter sometimes, you're in front of the sun, you're behind Jupiter.  You manufacture it.  You manufacture it.  You can do anything.  Your days would be all fucking willy-nilly.  Too many movies, man.  What manufacture?  If you could live, look.  I'm the man that thinks we're going to blow up a meteorite with a nuclear.  We actually, I'm telling you, we are eventually going to learn how to be mobile and slow. 
[00:33:00]  Is that sarcasm towards me or me?  Is that me?  Yeah.  I didn't say, I'd say, are we good in science and now you're coming to the right side?  I think that a lot of the shit they say is horse shit.  I don't believe in everything that they tell me.  I don't believe that a meteor killed the dinosaurs.  And if it did, it was whatever.  But I don't think a meteor is going to kill us.  You see that hole where that meteor is supposed to, that hole, how did that hole kill everything?  I don't give a fuck.  There might have been a larger hole somewhere else that was covered, or it might have been 
[00:33:30]  in the ocean that it hit.  It's fucking, literally, it blocked out the sun.  If it hit the ocean, it'd be great.  They say where the whole gulf of fucking Mexico was made by just a fucking meteor.  And those poor dinosaurs was walking around.  Look at the moon's surface.  But the dinosaurs didn't have doctors.  Maybe, maybe if they had doctor dinosaur, they would have fucking cured the cold that killed  them all.  And time out, fucking, there's a bunch of dinosaurs running around the goddamn earth anyway. 
[00:34:00]  Rhinoceruses are fucking dinosaurs.  I agree with you.  Alligators.  Alligators, crocodiles.  I agree with you, yes.  They're fucking dinosaurs.  They lived.  Some of the birds.  Condors.  Skeletal.  I'm telling you.  And they had to shrink to be able to, because before when they were brontosauruses, they had  to eat a tree a day or whatever.  So they had to adapt to be able to eat a bush a day.  One thing you say in the trial is, well, they did find a dinosaur bones and they dug 
[00:34:30]  it up and they thought it was a fake because they noticed he was holding the New York Times.  You know, like, no dinosaur would read that liberal rag.  Wait, so you think, Opie, so Ryan thinks genetic modification.  We're going to kill ourselves.  And I don't count ourselves as...  No, I came up with this.  Give me some kind of plague.  I think a natural occurring plague from just too many people.  China will fucking fuck something up. 
[00:35:00]  It's going to be the zombie apocalypse.  And there's so much...  Oh, I can only dream of a zombie apocalypse.  That would be great.  Other than dying, I would love to see the end of the world.  Other than being a part of dying and screaming, I would love to sit on my porch and just watch  the apocalypse fucking drones.  I want the Tina Turner Mad Max outfit with, like, the chain mail.  Really?  I've got a machete in my bed.  You want post-apocalyptic?  Oh, hell yeah.  To hang on as long as you can?  She's a sneaky...  She's a globalist...  She believes in all this creepy shit. 
[00:35:30]  She don't talk about it because Penhouse says...  I do not believe in that creepy shit.  Penhouse says, Ryan, don't talk that crazy.  Don't talk that crazy.  Just show your ass.  Yeah.  Don't talk about your ass.  Don't talk too much.  Ryan, too much...  People...  Just hold this out.  Just shut my mouth.  Hold my tits out.  All right.  Show that coach.  Put your nipples out and don't talk about it.  Here's how much she's upgraded in my head.  She's a globalist.  She's into the new world and shit, right?  Global banking and all that.  She believes in all that because she knows about Monsanto, but she shows her twat, right? 
[00:36:00]  Little hair on it and her tits, and it makes me go, now I can listen to you.  And I'm like, oh, she's fucking...  If I didn't see your little hairy cooch, I'd be like, hey.  It's my subject.  Shut up.  This is the thing.  It's about what I like.  Now, I'm looking at a close-up without spray paint and everything.  She has...  This is the thing.  Black guys love shit like this.  Yeah.  She has some stretchy marks, man.  Little smaller.  Little smaller.  Little smaller.  The booty cheeks, man.  But they look delicious. 
[00:36:30]  This is so real.  Yeah, that's a real ass right there.  Amazing.  And as hard as a rock but jiggly.  My goodness gracious.  There's no dimples going on there.  She's got a little bush on her.  The video guy gets to fucking have that glory in his face all the time.  Okay, man.  Battlestar Galactica is...  What'd you think?  Did you like Buck Rogers?  I'll talk about Tweaky all night.  If you tinkle on me, I'll do a Tweaky. 
[00:37:00]  B-D-B-D-B-D-B-D-B-D.  Oh, shit, dude.  Stay tuned.  Our tribute continues with more moments from Patrice O'Neal on the Opie and Anthony Show after this.  We continue with more of our tribute to Patrice O'Neal.  Hey, what's up?  This is Bill Burr, and you are listening to a tribute to Patrice O'Neal, who is the funniest stand-up, funniest human being I ever met. 
[00:37:30]  And if you're just flipping through the channels and you happen to catch this, please keep listening, because this guy's the best.  He's the best.  All right.  Remembering Patrice O'Neal, his greatest moments on O&A.  There's, like, hardcore country fans that listen to this program, and we got nothing for you.  I'm sorry.  We just don't get it.  We don't understand it.  I used to.  I'm tired of your fucking city slickers and your whole shit. 
[00:38:00]  I couldn't tell you the top country song in America.  I couldn't even get one of them.  I couldn't even get one of the top ten.  It kind of crossed over for a little while when Garth Brooks was big.  Right.  It was a big country crossover.  Remember?  Like, all of a sudden, somebody you knew started wearing cowboy boots.  I was more of an achy-breaky heart guy.  You.  No, I'm just kidding, bud.  My girl lost her foot in a lawnmower accident.  That's number one.  That's the number one song?  Bob, Bob, uh, Bootney. 
[00:38:30]  Bob, Bootney, um, Carnesby.  Billy Bob.  By Billy Bob Russell.  My girl lost her foot.  Hello, I'm Billy Bob Russell.  Give me the top ten country songs in America, and we'll do a little riffing.  I was into the country way back when, when I was growing up, because I was out west, and  I rode horses.  So, uh, my father always had it on in the truck.  But that was your old-school country. 
[00:39:00]  You know, your Loretta Land and shit.  But everybody liked that old-school country.  Old-school country was, like, super crossover.  Like, you know, you just, you know old-school country songs, because they're not really, like,  country kind of thing.  Yeah, it was, it was pretty, it was like, I think the big crossover back then was the  Stand By Your Man.  Stand by your man.  Oh, the coal mine is daughter.  Don't matter who he's fucking, just keep on sucking on his cock. 
[00:39:30]  That was the whole song.  Stand by him, don't matter what he does.  Island's in the stream.  Yeah.  Fucking anything by Charlie Pryde.  He might punch you in the face, but stand by your man.  Show the world you love him.  And they throw him bottles at the fucking screens on front of the stage.  Roll him up.  Pull him up.  Pull up.  Beautiful.  Oh, hi.  Oh, hi.  Hit him up.  Yeah.  There was some, uh, some big country songs back then. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  Now I don't even know who the fuck.  Achy Break Your Heart was the last thing that crossed over into my...  You would know Garth Brooks' songs, wouldn't you?  I know not one.  No?  Whatever his most famous song is that I should know, I probably don't know it.  Really?  But Achy Break Your Heart, I knew.  What's like Garth's...  What was Garth's biggest hit?  What was his biggest hit song?  I don't know.  You don't even know?  Well, maybe Patrice wouldn't have fucking...  Patrice knows a lot about white culture, though.  I'm from Boston, dude.  I really studied it.  And I'm corny.  I have a corny streak where it's like... 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  A lot of that shit is just like...  I do like...  It scares me sometimes.  I think maybe you're a spy.  The only problem I have is calling it a culture.  For other than that...  Oh, a real?  We're the top ten country songs.  We just want to go over the list.  No culture?  I just like hearing what y'all did with our shit and turning it into your shit.  Yeah.  That's pretty interesting.  All right.  We love stealing from the black man.  This is really the number one song in country music, huh?  Let's start with number ten. 
[00:41:00]  Are these albums or...  Or songs?  Songs.  Songs?  Does Derek have the list?  Maybe we can play a few of these.  Number ten.  Top country song in America right now.  Is a song...  The house next door to me was so...  What?  No.  No, that isn't?  And Garth Brooks is on the list.  He's still doing shit.  Man, there's country fans right now laughing at us.  Tim McGraw.  I heard of Tim McGraw.  Yeah.  He's like one of those guys who's big enough to have crossed over into my ears. 
[00:41:30]  But I don't know his songs, though.  George Strait?  You know George Strait?  Well, I got...  Man, fuck all that.  Get to the...  All right.  Well, I got it.  The number ten country song in America.  Here it is.  A little taste.  Yeah, that's not it.  God damn, motherfucker.  What is that shit?  What happened?  Just wrecked my own fucking...  You ruined your bit.  God damn it. 
[00:42:00]  Is this the chick from fucking...  Yes, it is.  Are you serious?  Yes, it is.  She's got the number one country song in America.  Wow.  Harry Underwood.  You're joking.  All right.  The number ten country song in America.  You got it, Derek?  Oh, it's awful.  I've heard this one, right?  You know this one?  Yeah.  A band called Little Big Town, and the song is called Boondocks.  I meant Carrie Underwood's song.  Oh.  Yeah.  Let's hear this.  This is the number ten country song in America.  Oh, wow. 
[00:42:30]  Let's hear it, boys.  This is good cousin fucking me.  I feel no shame.  I'm out of where I came from.  I was born and raised in the Boondocks.  One thing I know, no matter where I go, I keep my heart and soul in the Boondocks.  In the Boondocks.  And I can feel that muddy water running through my veins. 
[00:43:00]  I'm just laughing at this shit.  Just a little sprinkle of Parchers family in there.  I was feeling it to the Parchers family.  I feel that harmony came in.  Hey, I can feel the muddy water running through my veins.  Ruben Kincaid should be right around the corner.  I didn't manage this.  Yeah.  Manage this.  White people still have a black people gang.  Boondocks is our term.  That's a black man's term.  Boondocks.  The boonies.  That's number ten.  The boonies.  Got the muddy water running through his veins. 
[00:43:30]  I'm with Patrice on that.  I was kind of feeling it up until that harmony kicked in.  And then it got a little corny.  All right.  Shields and that, that, that.  Sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  Sha-na-na-na-na.  Let's go with number nine.  Top country songs in America.  We're trying to educate ourselves.  Yeah.  All right, all right.  And our listeners out there.  They're very good of us.  There's a band called Sugar Land, No Clue.  And the song is called Just Might Make Me Believe. 
[00:44:00]  Going for the heartstrings.  Yeah.  I got miles of trouble spreading far and wide.  Bills on the table getting higher and high.  There's always a problem.  They just keep on coming.  There ain't no end in sight. 
[00:44:30]  She might have to sell her body soon.  She's holding on.  I got someone who loves me more than words can say.  Oh, boy.  And I'm thankful for that each and every day.  But it can't pay the fucking bills.  He loves you because you have a tight snatch.  That's about it.  There's no other reason to love you, baby.  Who are you kidding? 
[00:45:00]  Still is hard to find face.  Here it comes.  But if you can look in my eyes.  Now, what's the definitive thing that makes this genre what it is?  Like, what is the thing that makes this country music?  What is that thing?  You know how rap is like?  Oh, it's obvious.  Hip-hop is like, you know, a good downbeat and a rap. 
[00:45:30]  You know, whatever.  But what's the definitive?  A relatable story.  But no.  It's all about relating.  It's a sound.  What's the sound like this?  Is it that drum?  A steel guitar is important.  Some kind of like.  No, I think it comes with a.  Plotting beat like this.  I think it's all about the lyrics and the story first.  But you can put these lyrics to.  Because this doesn't sound like a country song.  Yeah, but it is.  You can hear country.  You can just hear it.  It's not like a pop.  Listen to the background. 
[00:46:00]  Listen to background music.  To help me unwind.  Me, me, me, me.  It's that, like, bluesy thing going on.  Yeah, most country songs, I'm sorry, are essentially mechanically the same song.  You know, like they're constructed the same in terms of the way the chord progressions go.  Right.  It's the story that is crafted around.  So Ope's right.  But you could put the story and the lyrics to a hard rock song.  You're absolutely right.  And it's not country.  Right, and it's not country anymore.  Well, Leonard Skinner had that thing, but when I listen to Free Bird, I don't feel like I went over. 
[00:46:30]  This is if I leave here.  It doesn't sound like this.  It's got southern roots in it, that whole Leonard Skinner thing.  And so does country.  It's a very bluesy.  It's the mechanics of the song.  The way the harmonies are.  What was that song about anyway?  I don't know.  She can't pay her bills.  She's kind of like just holding on.  Yeah.  And this person she's in love with is the one that's going to make her believe everything will be okay.  Because it's not about money and all that. 
[00:47:00]  She's happy to be mediocre.  Yeah.  But then she drinks her margaritas to kind of make things...  Who doesn't?  All right.  Let's go on.  Drunk mediocrity.  That's what that song is about.  Let's go on to number eight.  There's a bit here somewhere.  We're going to try to find our way in the middle of this here.  Top ten country songs in America.  Number eight is a guy named Deerks.  Deerks.  Deerks Bentley.  Deerks Bentley.  I'm Deerks Bentley.  I'm listening to my album.  Coming a little closer. 
[00:47:30]  All right.  All right.  Deerks Bentley.  I pledge it to meet you.  You think the truckers in Alabama are just like, go ahead, fellas.  And they're just driving out.  How are we going?  Man, these guys, they're just multi-multi-culture.  And just listening to this horse shit.  And they're looking up into space.  Fucking somewhere it's still dark in fucking Utah.  And he's fucking driving out.  Going, man.  Exactly.  Don't you make fun of the girl from Sugar Land?  Right.  Bitchy McGillicuddy, she's a beautiful woman.  That was my goddamn wedding song, you motherfuckers. 
[00:48:00]  How about we play a little game?  Deerks Bentley.  Come a little closer.  What do you think this song is about?  Well, it's an alien from outer space.  And Deerks Bentley teams up with other people in the squad and they kill the alien.  I'm Deerks Bentley.  Deerks Bentley.  Deerks.  Deerks.  Deerks.  Deerks, get to the chopper.  Get down.  Get down, Deerks.  Come on, Deerks.  Do it.  Now.  All right. 
[00:48:30]  So what is Come a Little Closer about?  Come a Little Closer?  Self-explanatory.  Yeah.  A little love thing going on.  He's a...  Okay, ready?  It's a girl.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  It's a girl who he's been trying to get for a long time.  And he just wants her to...  She's wary.  Because this is now...  It's 2006.  Bitches are wary of man love.  God damn.  This guy's got...  This was exactly what I was going to say.  She's wary of man love.  And he's just like, look, I understand that you're a little nervous and you think I'm a 
[00:49:00]  wolf in sheep's clothing, but I love you.  And you'll see that...  Come a little closer.  You'll see that.  If you just come a little closer, you see that I'm Deerks Bentley.  So that's what it's about, you think?  That's what I say.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's listen to Deerks Bentley.  Come a little closer.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Oh. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, it's Pink Floyd.  Welcome to Machine.  All right.  Come a little closer, baby.  I feel like laying you down.  Oh.  Going for the balloon knot.  Date rape song.  All a bit of sweet surrender. 
[00:50:00]  Ugh.  Well, we can work it all out.  Work it all out?  Uh-oh.  Oh, what's the problem?  This guy stinks.  He's going to tell us the problem right here.  Let's listen to what the problem is.  There ain't nothing that love can't fix.  Okay.  Girl, it's right here at our fingertips.  I thought it was going to be dicks.  So come a little closer, baby.  I feel like laying you down.  Laying you down. 
[00:50:30]  I feel like laying you out.  Be more accurate.  Come a little closer, baby.  Need another verse.  I feel like letting go.  He's got a big jar of Vaseline.  He's going to punch her in the asshole.  Of everything that stands between us.  What's the problem?  And the love we used to know.  Ah, the problem.  They were in love.  Rediscovering each other.  I want to touch you like a cleansing ray. 
[00:51:00]  And let it wash all the hurt away.  I got it.  Pause this.  Pause it for a second.  Here's what the problem is.  Yeah.  We were thinking too complex, Patrice.  Yeah.  Here's the problem.  They got all kinds of problems and issues.  They were in love, but this guy probably sounds like an asshole.  Yeah.  Maybe cheated.  Probably did a little cheating.  Maybe hit her a little bit.  With the waitress down at the greasy spoon.  Right.  The greasy spoon.  Because she's willing to give up the balloon nod and this little filly isn't. 
[00:51:30]  And in his simple Dierks Bentley mind, he thinks, once I fuck you, it's all going to  be fine again.  Like, I know we got problems, baby, but just get in the bed.  Wait a minute, Eddie.  Get in the bed.  I learned a thing or two from the waitress down at the greasy spoon.  I'm going to show you what I learned.  You got to take calls from the actual motherfuckers who know.  Who know this stuff.  Who actually know what Dierks is talking about.  Dierks Bentley.  Come a little closer.  I'll even lick your ass.  You got to go, man, you don't have a goddamn clue what he's talking about. 
[00:52:00]  What he's saying is.  Well, let's see what Ken in New York has to say.  Ken, you know this song at all?  Hello?  Hi.  Do you know what Dierks Bentley is talking about in Come a Little Closer?  No, not really.  But I got to defend this country music, guys.  We're not bashing country.  We're really not.  We're basically telling you we have no fucking clue what it's about.  We kind of like little big town boondocks until they sounded like the Partridge family.  You know what, guys?  I'm from New York, born and raised.  And I got into country music three or four years ago.  I can just fucking identify with it. 
[00:52:30]  I don't know what.  I can't even explain it myself.  Really?  Thank you.  I want to go to Ty in Alabama.  Ty?  Yeah.  What's up?  Y'all boys taking this shit a little bit too far now, ain't you?  Damn.  It's all right.  We all messing with the spook up there.  Y'all fucking with my music.  See?  The second we hit the Midwest, it's over, Johnny.  They can't take the joke now.  I love when you was with the Puerto Ricans this morning and the Mexicans.  That shit's funny. 
[00:53:00]  Hey, you got to call a spade a spade and a chick a chick.  But you can't mess with Dierks.  Don't fuck with Dierks Bentley, god damn it.  Yeah, but see, if I was a listener to this program, I'd be enjoying how clueless your pals  Opie Anthony and Patrice are when it comes to country music.  Well, the whole thing is, his name's Dierks Bentley.  It ain't Dierks, it's Dierks.  Oh, Dierks.  It's Dierks to us.  He spells it D-I-E-R-K-S.  Dierks Bentley.  Doesn't matter?  Doesn't really matter?  All right, wait.  Well, we got to find out what's going on. 
[00:53:30]  I think there's more to this story.  Thank you, T.  Or, Ty.  Ty, thank you.  I brought you now.  All right, don't take it seriously, though.  We understand that someone's music is out there, but we're just trying to tell you we have  no fucking idea.  Oh, they'll laugh at him.  Hey, look, if we was on here just trying to deconstruct rap, okay?  Right.  Motherfucker, they'll be out there.  Oh, dude, let's do that.  Are you in tomorrow?  Yeah.  All right, we'll do that.  Let me tell you.  I can never understand what them nods are.  Exactly.  That's who you get, but you're fucking their country music.  We're trying to teach it, right?  We're trying to learn. 
[00:54:00]  I'm trying to learn about this goofy-ass music.  I want to be educated.  All right, tomorrow we'll do the opposite.  We've got to find the top ten rap songs in America.  Right.  Deconstruct it.  I'll tell you what else.  We just need some kind of music.  I'll do it right now.  I don't even have to hear the songs.  Four of them, somebody's getting smacked, and three of them, somebody's getting shot.  That's right.  Somebody's getting shot, somebody's getting...  And then in between, he's going to talk about his rims, and his fucking gold around his neck,  and his gold visus.  Oh, wait a minute.  Okay, if you're going to say that, I bet you there's a running theme in this horse shit, 
[00:54:30]  too.  All right, well...  There must be a running theme into this.  You're right.  All right, let's get back to Come a Little Closer, because...  Dierks or Dierks Bentley.  Dierks Bentley.  Let's get back to the song.  Come a Little Closer, baby.  All right.  I feel like letting go.  Letting go.  So got you.  Of everything that stays between us and the love we used to know. 
[00:55:00]  All right, he's going to fix it.  I want to touch you like a cleansing ring.  Cleansing ring.  And let it wash all the hurt away.  Oh, this guy fucked her up.  I said, come a Little Closer, baby.  And now he wants her back.  He's going to fix it by fucking her.  What a guy.  What a guy.  What a trooper.  Let's forget about all that shit I did to you. 
[00:55:30]  I can feel now.  Remember the good banging I used to give you.  All right, that's enough of that little ditty there.  There's Dierks Bentley and Come a Little Closer.  Some guy is just, and they don't want us to talk over it because some guy is just going,  man, you know.  Yeah.  I sure like this song.  Man, what a great song.  Who's the pig with the hos?  Let's say, let's move on to the next.  The big guy.  Let's. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, that is a big guy.  He is big.  Did Patrice just fall on the floor?  Yeah, Patrice just fell on the floor.  He actually.  Ow.  See, his evil Opie comes out.  Ow.  Patrice, you all right?  Oh, fuck me.  Get up off the floor, man.  We can't pick you up if there's a problem.  Ow.  Ow.  I'm sorry.  What's wrong, man?  Oh, my God.  It's just perfectly said what it is. 
[00:56:30]  Just this fat face with all these tins.  Oh.  What is she?  The support team?  Oof.  All right.  We'll get into the hotness that's outside the studio in a little bit.  But we're in the middle of a fine, fine bit here.  Oh, God.  Top country songs in America.  Number seven is good old Garth Brooks.  Yeah.  And Good Ride Cowboy.  All right.  What's this song about?  Oh, hold up.  We got to figure it out?  Yeah, we got to figure it out.  Yeah.  But it's Garth, so it's probably just about being a cowboy. 
[00:57:00]  Just having a good time.  Yeah.  Good time.  Fun.  Oh, it sounds fun already.  Nothing bothers me.  From the hills of KC, Wyoming, where life's really and wild.  In the Navy, Brad, and a cowboy hat, and that cold Benahagan smile.  Yeah.  And from the Bronx, honky-tonk, she always sang a cowboy song.  We were much too young, having too much fun, as we all sang along. 
[00:57:30]  And we sang a lot, say highway.  There's only one way you're going to get through.  And when she starts to twist, be more like Chris.  Pull your hat down tight.  And just look, do it when that whistle blows and the crowd explodes.  I don't get it.  Yeah, that's a nice, that's one of those things they do, their variation of the electric slide. 
[00:58:00]  What do those crackers do?  What do they call it?  Line dance.  Line dance.  No, that's a little crack of line dance song there.  Where they, like, lift their boot and give it a tap with their foot, and then all turn.  And the girls with the skirts and the cowboy boots and those horrendous hairdos.  Tickle, tickle, feet.  Fucking a good time.  Make me like this shit.  Right.  Sell it. 
[00:58:30]  Don't just come and go, oh, watch your mouth, man, nigga.  Make up.  That song sounded fun, that's all.  Steve.  Steve knows what that song's about.  Steve likes fucking country, huh?  I do.  That was a, I think that's a tribute song to the late Chris Ledoux, who died of cancer  last year, I believe.  Who is he?  Chris Ledoux was another singer.  And he was a good old cowboy.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm Chris Ledoux.  All right, we're going to move on, because we want to try to get through this here.  Number six.  Top country songs in America. 
[00:59:00]  You sold out Chris Ledoux.  We're trying to educate ourselves here today.  Oh, I can't get enough of that shit.  Love Arnold.  Let's say hi to Tim McGraw.  Tim McGraw.  My old friend.  What's my old friend about?  His dog.  This could be, oh, very good.  His dog.  His dog.  This could be, now, Tim McGraw, son of Tug McGraw.  Right.  Tug died.  I guess they hadn't known each other for a long time.  This could be a father. 
[00:59:30]  About his dad.  About his dad.  My old friend.  I say it's about an inanimate object.  It's either, it's not a human.  It's either a truck.  Yeah.  His favorite truck.  His, um, his fucking, uh, dog.  Yeah.  Maybe his, I don't know Tug, I don't know Tim that well.  I would say his gun or something, but probably not his gun.  Not his gun.  But something like a truck.  His old friend that never lets him down.  Yeah.  And it's never a human being that never lets you down.  All right.  It's always something else that let, humans let you down, but not your fucking, not your 
[01:00:00]  old, not your old, your old something, your old thing with the thing and then over there.  So you're saying some type of machine thing.  Ope is saying somebody that says his old hound dog, and I'm saying it's going to be maybe  dear old dad.  That has nothing to do with a woman, right?  No woman.  No, no woman in this one.  Tim McGraw, my old friend.  Let's take a listen.  A little up-tempo. 
[01:00:30]  Up to the intro.  Maybe it's just about his old friend.  Them for gold.  All right.  Let's take a listen.  They laugh and they cry me. 
[01:01:00]  They somehow sanctify me.  The woven in the stories I have told.  Until again.  My old friend.  I apologize.  For the years that have passed since the last time you and I have dusted off those memories.  This old friend.  Running at this.  Now, Patrice.  All right, pause it. 
[01:01:30]  Pause it.  Patrice got something.  I'm telling you.  Listen.  It's hanging on his wall.  He's being clever.  Since I dusted off.  No one dusts off their fucking buddy.  You understand?  You think?  He dusted off the thing.  It's a thing.  I'm telling you.  You think it's still going to be a thing?  I don't fucking know.  It's hanging on a wall.  Maybe in the chorus he talks about it.  Maybe it's pictures of memories of him and a friend.  I think it's his old friend that he just doesn't call anymore.  Just a buddy?  No.  Maybe we're overthinking it again.  Maybe a friend.  He doesn't know how to quit. 
[01:02:00]  I don't know how to quit you.  You know what?  If this.  When we was on Brokeback Mountain.  I was fucking you in the ass.  If this doesn't turn into something clever that, like you said, making, then the rest  of these songs, whatever it says, if it says Sugar Land, I want to say it's about sugar.  All right.  No more credit to country music if this motherfucker's talking about just his buddy.  All right.  Let's hear.  Let's go.  Back to my old friend.  There's always somewhere else I had to be. 
[01:02:30]  Time gets thin.  My old friend.  I don't know why.  I don't know why.  I don't know why.  Oh, you don't know why.  Uh-huh.  I don't know why. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, someone's saying it's a deer head.  It's a deer head on his wall.  Done.  Done with that.  Who cares?  It didn't even say what.  I think it's about the fact that Tim used to have some fine friends, and then he became  this huge country superstar and kind of didn't forget about his friends, but didn't have  time for his friends because he was too busy traveling America and becoming this huge country  star and realized, oh my God, my old friend. 
[01:03:30]  My old friend.  He would never run so dedicated to some guys that he left because he got famous.  Could be.  I don't know.  Jesus.  He didn't say anything.  It was vague.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And if that was to his old friends, they're so vague, they wouldn't sit there and go,  ah, Tim, remember me.  It's like, who the fuck is he talking about?  What?  All right.  Let's go to number five.  Top country songs in America.  Brad Paisley featuring Dolly Parton.  Holy shit.  Brad Paisley. 
[01:04:00]  Hello.  I'm Brad Paisley.  Pleasure to meet you.  Arnold, what is this song about?  I, I, this is called, when I get where I'm going, I'm going to kill something.  Featuring Dolly Parton.  Really?  Dolly Parton's in this one?  Yeah.  When I get where I'm going.  What's this about?  Where I get, when I get where I'm going.  Is it a physical trip or is it something that's going on?  I'm going to keep it simple.  Spiritual.  It's a spiritual trip. 
[01:04:30]  It's spiritual.  I got to get, I still give it credit.  Come on.  Come on, country music.  Guy's a trucker and he's hauling something and he, when he gets where he's going,  I'm going to get paid and buy some beer.  I'm on Route 66, headed to Route 82.  That's where I'm going.  And when I get there, I get paid.  I get paid.  Meow, meow, meow, meow.  Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.  Well, my Peter Belt is running. 
[01:05:00]  When I get where I'm going.  When I get where I'm going.  All right.  It's a spiritual journey he's on.  I'm thinking.  I'll say spiritual.  Spiritual?  Spiritual?  When I get where I'm going.  On the far side of the sky.  The first thing that I'm going to do is spread my wings and fly. 
[01:05:30]  I'm going to land beside a light.  Run my fingers through his mane.  Where I might find out what it's like to ride a drop of rain.  Yeah, when I get where I'm going.  There'll be only happy tears. 
[01:06:00]  I will shed the sins and struggles I have carried all these years.  And I'll leave my heart wide open.  I will love and have no fear.  Yeah, when I get where I'm going.  Don't cry for me down here.  I'm going to walk with my granddaddy. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, he's got cancer.  Oh, boy.  Oh, he's got the big C.  Oh, fucking come on, man.  God damn.  Don't say that.  He's giving a positive spin to cancer.  No fucking way.  Essentially, he's going to be up there with granddaddy.  And I'll hug his neck.  Yeah, when I get where I'm going.  There'll be only happy tears. 
[01:07:00]  See, because usually the sad tears when a loved one dies.  But don't worry about him.  He's going to be all right.  I didn't see this guy.  He's going to be with granddaddy.  All right.  All right.  Enough of the cancer song.  That guy's not dying.  That's a dying song.  Let's go to Amanda in Brooklyn.  Amanda.  Good morning.  What's the Brad Paisley Dolly Parton song all about?  Well, usually the newer country stars like to link up with an old one to do some type  of tribute song or something like that.  And it's pretty much about going to heaven and what it's going to be like. 
[01:07:30]  It's pretty basic.  That one's an easy one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's not dying.  No, just talk about what it's going to be like when you get there, just dreaming about  it, I think.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Yeah, I know.  Pretty depressing.  All right.  Thank you, Amanda.  Thanks.  Have a good one.  All right.  Let's move on to number four here.  We're almost done.  Billy Carrington.  Billy Carrington.  That was a movie I did in 96.  I was Billy Carrington.  The song's called Must Be Doing Something Right. 
[01:08:00]  Must Be Doing Something Right.  This is him counting his blessings.  Yep.  This is what it is.  This is an absolute love song.  I got a girl.  She's wonderful.  He's maybe got a good career.  He's got this.  I must be doing something right.  Life is good.  Right.  It's just about the love of his life.  Just a girl?  You think it's just a girl?  Just a girl.  Must be doing something right.  Absolutely just without a girl.  All right.  That's good.  I say it's general blessing. 
[01:08:30]  General blessing.  Yep.  I say it's general blessing this guy to be in the position he's in.  Because you never heard of it.  This guy's new.  And it's like, thank you to show business for letting him do his dream.  Uh-huh.  No girl.  All right.  There's no girl involved.  Not a girl.  I'm saying this is all about-  He has another girl somewhere.  A love life.  Okay.  Must be doing something right.  All right.  Billy Carrington, everyone.  A woman is a mystery 
[01:09:00]  That angels can't understand  Sometimes all it takes to please her  Is the touch of your hand  Yeah, the back of it  Other times you gotta take it slow 
[01:09:30]  And hold her all night long  Heaven knows there's so many ways  A man can go wrong  There he comes.  Now  Must be doing something right  I just heard your sigh  You leaned into my kiss and close  Those deep blue need you eyes 
[01:10:00]  Don't know what I did  All right.  That's really bad stuff.  I told you it was all about a girl.  Yeah, you're right.  All about a girl.  He figured out-  That guy can sing to this guy  It's like-  He figured out-  Smooth voice.  Yeah.  He figured out it's not all about the fucking  You figured out it's the little things you do  Yeah, rub the little things  The little hand-holding  And the little kisses on the neck  You know  Rub the clit in a counterclockwise motion  It's about the little things  Right  A little spit on the tip  And just rub it slow

[01:28:30]  You've just lost it  Lost it all  Just let  You gotta  Put your faith in God  Doesn't it sound like  It should be that  That's not it  No  It's literal  It's literal  It's literal  Jesus  Grab the wheel  Why  I can't fucking drive  It's a tribute  To her  She got all fucked up  Her American Idol thing  It's a tribute to  Like her dreams coming true  No no  I mean  I'm driving  I'm fucking  You take the wheel  From me  Why  The car is skidding  But is she drunk  Jesus  Jesus 
[01:29:00]  Oh literally  Jesus  Get on the anti-lock brakes  So there's a Puerto Rican in the car  Really this is Jesus  Take the wheel  I have no idea  You don't know what it's about  I'm just saying it's literal  No  No  Jesus  Take the wheel  Her life  No  Needs a little  Spiritual help  Not needs  Jesus  Put it in four wheel drive  This is a thank you  It's snowing  She already had her help  This is a thank you  She doesn't  This bitch is not coming out saying  You're trying to tell me  That Jesus is a designated driver  Jesus  My tranny lights on  What do I do  Jesus 
[01:29:30]  I need oil  It's about  Jesus  Take the wheel  Jesus  Check the  Alternating  Jesus  Slow down  You're making me nervous  You're driving too fast  You might be immortal  But I could still hurt my ass  We like  Leaving on an up note  But this is going to be  Very obvious  Very boring  And  And we're just going to have to  You might be immortal  You might be immortal  You're alright  But I'm scared shitless 
[01:30:00]  Here in the left hand lane  You drive like you're insane  This is going to be like  Jesus  This is going to be like  That dumb poem  With the four fucking footprints  Footprints  And then there's two  And where were you  And I really needed you  Well that's when I was carrying you  That's what this song is all about  So so far  What is  Would you agree with this list  Would you reverse anything  Put anything  We don't know  It's all the same to me  It's all the same  This is the same stuff  I think Billy Curranton 
[01:30:30]  I think Billy Curranton is good  Alright let's go to  Carry on to it  And get this over with  Jesus Take the Wheel  Number one country song  In America  Oof  A little violin in there  It's nice right  She was driving last Friday  On her way to Cincinnati  On a snow white Christmas seat  There you go 
[01:31:00]  Going home to see her mama  And her daddy  With the baby in the back seat  Baby's in the back seat  50 miles to go  When she was running low  Aunt's going to nail this one  Here we go  She's giving false hope to people  Too fast  Black ice  Oh no 
[01:31:30]  Oh that's real smart  Jesus Take the Wheel  Jesus Take the Wheel  Did he take the wheel though?  Did he take the goddamn wheel?  Let's listen and find out  No  No  Apparently not  Give me one more chance  Wow man 
[01:32:00]  Wow  You know  Have a little survival instinct  And steer into the skid  You stupid bitch  Oh wow  Stop giving false hope  To everybody out there  With your number one song  Literally she  Jesus  Well I believe  It's been a hard year  And literally  She wants you know  Jesus take the wheel  But figuratively speaking  I think she's giving herself up  To Jesus right here  At this moment  The low point in her life  Oh oh  Jesus help her  Why don't you saw that baby 
[01:32:30]  In the backseat  Sleeping like a rock  For the first time  In a long time  But she bowed her head  To pray  She said  I'm sorry for the way  I've been living my life  This is the bitch  That's from the last song  So from now on  The husband left  She's out whoring  See now she's not skidding anymore  But she's still saying 
[01:33:00]  She has just surrendered  Her life to Jesus  And as far as her life goes  Does that work out?  No that didn't work out either  It sounds like it worked out  It's a shame  Did she die in this song?  No  She made it  She believes in her faith  And look  It did her well  She sounds good though  I think she should  I think she should pray  To Goodyear Tire  Because that seemed to be  What saved her  In that situation  Jesus taking  I can't do it  Maybe the bitch  Should stop 
[01:33:30]  Putting on makeup  As she drives  She would have been alright  Jesus took the wheel  But there you go  The Lord and Savior  I have learned things  And I  She had Jesus  In her back pocket  Jesus pulled one of those  Like 180 moves  Spins the car  Puts it back in drive  He jumped out the window  Did a roll  Oh it was great  Jumped over the drawbridge  He's driving like  It's the Italian job  Through the sewers  That Jesus can drive  Jesus can listen to saves  See when it clicks  He's a sale cracker  This worked out very well 
[01:34:00]  So the listeners  Got to remind us  To bring this bit back  When it's a whole  Bunch of brand new songs  Brand new ones  Because these songs  Will stay in that list  For a long time  So maybe a couple months  Down the road  Where was Jesus  When Dale Earnhardt  Was driving?  Holy shit  Where was Jesus then?  Jesus take the wheel  Nope  Nope  Sorry  I'm too busy  Saving some other bitch  That can't drive  On a light sheet of ice  Sorry there  Number three  A lot of people  Are saying  Jesus take the wheel  Yeah cause  Jesus made a joke  She said take the wheel 
[01:34:30]  He goes  You want me to come  To shoot her?  Yeah exactly  Why?  I was just joking  Jesus take the wheel  No I'm busy here  I made a little joke  Oh my gosh  More of our favorite  On a appearances  From the late  Patrice O'Neal  After this  We continue  With more of our tribute  To Patrice O'Neal  Hey what's up  It's Troy from  Opie and Anthony  And I'm going to talk  A little bit about  Patrice  You know  These past couple days 
[01:35:00]  Have been really hard  For everybody  And I just have  Was very fortunate  To have met  And known Patrice  A little bit  And working for the show  You get these moments  Of time  Where you get to  Work with him  On something  Or you have to  Deal with him  On something  And I always knew  That they were special  When they were happening  Because he was  Somebody that I've never  Like I've never met  Before in my entire life  So I even just  I kind of treasured  Those moments 
[01:35:30]  While he was alive  And now that he's gone  I treasure them  So much more  And Patrice is actually  Responsible for  Me doing my first  Major production piece  That I turned into  The Opie and Anthony show  Called Side Pussy  And he just went on  This rant about  Tiger Woods  And having girls  On the side  And it was just  Something that was  Just broken down  In just dude language  And every guy  Thinks that way 
[01:36:00]  Every guy  You know  Maybe most guys  Would like  A girl on the side  Of their wife  Or their girlfriend  And they don't even  Have to be  The hottest one  They don't have to be  As hot as your wife  Or your girlfriend  They can be a couple  Steps down  And he just  He broke it down  Like  I've never heard  Anybody do  And it was such  A long piece of audio  That I just thought  To myself  I need to make  A song out of this  And the world  Needs to hear it 
[01:36:30]  Because it's that  Fucking funny  And I hope  I did it justice  I know that  The material there  You could  Play without music  And it would be amazing  But I tried to  Put it to some  Sort of music  For  I don't know  My ode  To the great  Patrice O'Neal  And so  Patrice  Thank you for  Everything  Thank you for  Being amazing  Thank you for  Changing my life  Personally  And  You're going to 
[01:37:00]  Be missed  Unbelievably  Remembering Patrice  O'Neal  His greatest  Moments on ONA  Kevin  What's going on  Guys  Kevin Hart  This is a nice  Surprise  How are you  Brother  I'm good  I'm good  I'm good  You hanging in  There  Yeah man  You know  Times could be  A little better  Yeah no shit  Due to the  Circumstances  But I can't  I can't complain  Yeah I  This one just  We've been saying  It all week  This one just  Fucking hurts  If people don't know  Kevin Hart 
[01:37:30]  Knew Patrice O'Neal  Real well  Yeah  This was a  Dude you know  I can't even  I don't like  That be down  Dude  But this one  This one hit me  A little hard  You know  It definitely  You know we can't  Say that it was  A shocker  Because we knew  He was in the hospital  We knew that  Things definitely  Weren't great  But you know  Reality doesn't  Hit you  Until you  You're really  Really smacked  In the face  With it  You know  In our mind  It's like  Alright well he's  In the hospital  But he'll be alright 
[01:38:00]  Big dummy  He'll be good  You know  Right  It's not that serious  Or you know  It's a matter of time  Before he's out  Back to himself  And you know  After a while  You just didn't hear  Nothing  You didn't hear  Any news  You didn't hear  Any good news  Or bad news  So the way  That I'm thinking  Is no news  Is good news  And then  Literally Monday  You know  He was smacked  With the whole  Wow Patrice  He passed away  And dude  I honestly  I just sat down  And cancelled my day  I didn't do anything 
[01:38:30]  I talked to Keith  For a while  And in reality  Hit me a little later  You know  As a man  You don't like prime  As a man  You don't like it  But it's weird  When it actually comes out  Because you realize  The one that you're  Closest to  Dude  And I lost a good one  I really lost  A close friend  So  It was a low blow  Yeah  It's  You can't  I still haven't  Been able to wrap  My mind around this  At all  I've just been  Walking through  The last month  Just numb  It kind of sucked  That we couldn't  Give anyone updates  Because we sort of 
[01:39:00]  Knew right from  The beginning  That this stroke  Was a motherfucker  And people were all  Trying to stay positive  And we all just knew  What the outcome  Was going to be  Unfortunately  You never know  You always hear  Those stories  Where it's like  Wow you know  It was supposedly  Really bad  But then  You know  Something happened  People you know  Will bring up  The word miracle  Right  And you always hope  For that  Absolutely  But in this case  That never happened  And yeah  It's such a  Fucking bummer  Because he was just 
[01:39:30]  A you know  And Colin said  A one of a kind  You know  There's no one  Even close  To being  Like him  You know  He's irreplaceable  In that way  Yeah  That's funny  You say that  Because that's  When I say  When reality  Hits  Yeah  You know  You realize  Exactly  What a person  Was worth  What their  Self-worth was  Right  And what they  Meant to the business  And you know  When it comes 
[01:40:00]  To stand-up comedy  Man  The one thing  That comedians  Attempt to do  Is pride themselves  On originality  You know  Everybody  Attempts  To be  Different  They attempt  To be  Clever  They attempt  To be witty  You know  Or smart  Or groundbreaking  And people  Really don't  Understand  How  How groundbreaking  Patrice was  You know  From  Dealing with the business  From not wanting  To be  The guy  That was Hollywood 
[01:40:30]  From refusing  To let agents  And managers  Dictate his career  To not being afraid  To tell people  To shut their mouth  Like if they  They were out of line  Like the man  Definitely was  He was on a  Different plateau  Man  And you know  I think now  People are honestly  Going to understand  What that man's  Worth was  To comedy  You know  After going back  And looking at  His body at work  So it's sad  That we gotta  Miss him  Miss him  This way  For people to  Realize it  But you know  I think now  People will 
[01:41:00]  Honestly understand  The talent  That Patrice  On that was  I said it earlier  He's gonna be  Massively huge  In death  Unfortunately  When they  They should have  Realized when he  Was alive  And he was  About to hit  On his own  Terms  He was right  There finally  On his own  Terms  He was gonna  Make it  The way he  Wanted to  And that  Hurts too  You know  Cause we all  Know that  He definitely  Wanted that  Very true  Dude  Very very  True  Yeah  Now you guys  Are gonna  Witness me  Try not to  Cry  And if I  Do cry  And you  Repeat 
[01:41:30]  I swear  They got  I'm a  Punchbow  Yeah  I mean  I've seen  A lot  Of tough  Guys  Cried  In the last  Week  Yeah  It's just  Been  It's been  So tough  Because  Yeah  He's just  So fucking  Original  And different  You take it  For granted  When he's  When he was in  Here  Doing the show  You took for  Granted  Everything  Everything  From his  His big  Dumb  Booming  Laugh  To  You know  His take  On relationships  And shit  Like that  And then  When you  Realize  You're never  Going to  Get that  Anymore  It becomes 
[01:42:00]  Really  Really sad  You know  And he  Was  He was  Never  Not funny  Yeah  Never  I mean  Whether the  Mics were on  The mics  Were off  Or we  Were just  Hanging out  In the  Street  Or just  Taking an  Elevator  Ride  He made  Interesting  Everything  He was  Always on  You're beyond  You guys are  Beyond true  Yeah  Beyond it man  Beyond the  Dude  Well you know  Like I said  I don't like to  Be the Debbie  Downer  You know  I believe  That when  Things like  This happen  You have to

[01:54:30]  888 number  In his phone for me  That used to be my beeper  When I first came to New York  He's still  He's got  888-664  He's got my beeper number  That's how long  That's good news  That Norton was never really  That makes me happy  I had the old cells  Look  The time I jumped off  At his house  Man  Those were the good old days  He did catch me  And I have to admit  I wasn't beating off  At his house  Because Kev at the time  Was the first one 
[01:55:00]  To have a Mac  And the porn  Just streamed  I was lonely  The porn was streaming  And I got caught  But you know  This is a fun conversation  Because I ain't talked  To the nigga  In a long time  He caught me  Patrice caught me  Fucking in my garage  Me and my wife  Listen  Me and my wife  Was fucking in the car  Because Patrice was upstairs  So Patrice came downstairs  He said  He called me  Like he waited like  45 minutes  To call me  He said  Uh  Little dummy  Were y'all just 
[01:55:30]  Fucking in the car  I said  Yeah  Well that's no big deal  Because Kev had a bed  In his house  That he  He needed a ladder  To climb up  To  He needed a small  Step stool  To get in it  And him and his wife  Used to fuck all the time  And that's not  The story  That's all they do  Because the nigga's zero  And the other legendary  Thing about little Kev  Is he had to  Dick the size  Of a baby arm  It's really depressing  Are you serious?  No but I've heard  It suppresses me 
[01:56:00]  And I don't even need  To say the no homo thing  It's just like  You know  If you know  Girls are like  Hey hi  How are you?  The motherfucker  Might be like  Hey  And it's like  Hey  And he just goes  Look I got a big dick  If I'm fucking a girl  I'll actually go  You should meet my friend  Kevin  If Kev put  We could be hanging out  With prostitutes  And Kev  Could pull his dick out  And ruin everything  Even for the prostitutes 
[01:56:30]  Cause now  They're like  Well if not  If everybody's dick  Ain't that  Like it was a  It was a collective  Oh  But it's a dick to have  If you're gonna be  Kramus  Nigga  You're talking to  Your special guest  I know I've been  Downgraded  To I'll see you  Friday  Fucking A  Hey Patrice  I love Patrice man  Everybody having a  Fucking great time  I can come down

[02:00:00]  Because he's funny  And he's masterful  At Hollywood  I wish I could take a page  At him  But the thing is  And the other thing  I'm hoping happens  Is that he gets old  And he starts to be cute  And he starts to look like  Gary Coleman  I go through a horrible  Oh shit  Cute guy  Who can't jump on the floor  And spit on his head no more  I can't fucking wait  To the downfall 
[02:00:30]  Of his little prick  Hey  Hey Patrice  Listen before you hang up  Listen to what I told him about  That had me in tears  Dude  Do you remember  When we were in LA  And we went out  And we was at the comedy clubs  You were so disgusted  With the circuit  And the people  And you started  You just started bashing the comics  But you were doing  I have no bridges left  In LA  Because  But see  I retired  People don't know  I retired  But I'm gonna have to  Come back out  I retired  But I think I'm gonna just say

[02:01:30]  Cause I'm starting to get  Headaches too much  And I know I'm out the way  I'm gonna burn my last fucking bridge  And it's gonna be spectacular  I swear to fucking god  That's awesome  But at least  At least  I'm telling you  At fucking least  I got to talk to this nigga again  Cause  I'm telling you  I'm very surprised  Cause usually when white people are out  Kev  Don't talk to me man  I'm just telling you  He'll run away from me  This is how little he thinks of you guys  He realizes 
[02:02:00]  Nobody in this room can help him  He knows that  We have nothing to offer  It's not stupid  Okay  Hey  Who started  Who started that  Patrice  Who started that Bill Burr beating  Who started that Bill Burr bus beating  Oh  You know what it was  I'll tell you what it is  Jim Norton is  Really  You gotta be careful  Cause another thing  Kev is like this too  And I think it's that  It's that Napoleon complex thing  And it's a really 
[02:02:30]  Kev  This  This jerk off story started  One day  We used to go downstairs  Back in the day  At the cellar  When  When guys would be performing  Okay  And we would sit there  And all sit in the front row  And stare at  Oh get the fuck out  Oh yeah  Damn  Oh that's brutal  Jesus  But this is  He  This was the test  I mean we were brutal  We used to have  A hack court  We would put up 
[02:03:00]  Somebody's act  On court  They did it for me  Hack court  I love it  Hack court  You put a bit on trial  Dude they would do it  All the time  It's fantastic  I had a joke  We went downstairs  And we went downstairs  And sat in front of him  And he was  He was flustered  We was getting him  And he  And I  He just caught me  Jerking off in his house  This mother  This is how you know  He  He  He  Fucking 
[02:03:30]  Started  Imitating me  Jerking off  Like jerking off  Of his house  Damn sure did  I pushed the button  I didn't hear that  Nothing else  He  He  He started cutting out of that  Like  It was nasty  It hurt me  He had to do  What he had to do  Cause he fucking had to get out  That situation  By any means necessary  Now here's  Here's this fucker  Jim  Bill was talking about  Something  And  And Jim  Oh  Jim said something  And Bill said something  To Jim 
[02:04:00]  And Jim didn't like  What Bill said to him  Like he  He said  It was  It was gonna be embarrassing  And Jim was gonna get a fucking beating  For what happened  And I forgot what it was  But Jim goes  In front of me  Kev  Keith  And I think  It was another  Bob Kelly  Bobby was there for the bus beating  It was Kelly  But it was me  And Lil' Kev  That was giving the beating  With the  With the  But  But  But Norton goes 
[02:04:30]  At least  I'm not performing  On a bus  Fuck  That's right  I do not remember  No  That's right  Patricia  100% right  Because Bill  Bill was going at it  With you Jim  And he hit you with something  He hit you good  And we were about to attack you  You're right  We were about to jump on your ass  Jimmy had his back pocket  I think I remember that  He threw a neutron bomb  And everybody said  What?  I remember that  We said  What?  I turned on a bus for tickets 
[02:05:00]  It was  Great  Great  Great deflection  To this day  There was  There was three beatings  Four beatings  Of all time  And I'm telling you  Norton was a part of two of the  Two of my biggest laughs  In my life  But this  Bus beating  Bus beating is legendary  Of Kev  Because what  What happened is  You feed Kev  The important lines  And he would just make it  Just  He would take it  To the next level  And what was  What the whole thing 
[02:05:30]  Was for an hour was  Well  What happens if you  Start bombing  And then  Where do you come from  And where do you go  When you hit it  We said  Where did they  We said  Oh you just said  Now you're from  We said  Where did they bring you  From  We said  We said  Bill  Bill was behind  The bus driver  Bill Burr  He just takes a step out  Oh  He was just  Sitting in the front seat  There's no way  For him not to know  That he was the comic  We was like 
[02:06:00]  How do you sneak  On stage Bill  What's he saying  He left him at me  And they said  He started bombing  What he would do  Is go  After one joke bombs  He'd just look out  The window  And go  If you look to your  Oh shit  It was an all time  But oh man  Good  Good reminiscence  And then  Is it  Was it all like  The public address system  Oh dude  Like hey  How about that  I went to the container store  With my girlfriend  With that fucking

[02:13:30]  To stay for the Chris Cornell interview  As he explained  That he had nothing to add  Because he knew nothing  Of Soundgarden  Or Chris Cornell  Or something like that  After about ten minutes  Of the interview  Patrice turns around  Dramatically to face me  And only me  And he gives me  That special  Patrice O'Neal  What the fuck look  As if saying  I said I have nothing to add  And I wanna go home  He was always real  And we'll let you know  The shit's real 
[02:14:00]  I'll miss you Patrice  Rest in peace  Remembering Patrice O'Neal  His greatest moments  On ONA  We were just talking about  Snakes on a plane  Snakes on a plane  What's that hissing  It's a snake on a plane  Snake on a plane  We were saying  He should just substitute  All of his Pulp Fiction lines  And just put them in the movie  Seems like that's what happened  That's some tasty oatmeal  Snake 
[02:14:30]  You read the bible  Snake  This is some repugnant  Mother Evan  Stop that hissing  What are we gonna do  About the snake  How are they gonna pull this off  Like you guys were saying  During the break  How is this movie  Gonna be pulled off  I just wanna know  It's got so much hype  And everyone's like  Goofing on it  Before it comes out  And talking about it  I've been hearing about  Snakes on a plane  Since what  Like Thanksgiving  Oh man  It's been months  It's been a really long time  They've been hyping this movie 
[02:15:00]  For almost a year  And apparently  As per E-Rock  They had to rewrite  The film a lot  Because during I guess  Some of the quick screenings  They've given people  They didn't like the fact  That Sam Jackson  Didn't use the  Amareffer enough  Which is one of his  You know  Everyone loves hearing him  Use that phrase  He's still in his Jedi mode  Yeah  He's still in his  Ace Windu  The force  Yeah  Hey my children  Ace Windu  Whatever the hell  His name was  But they  Yeah they wanted more 
[02:15:30]  Him cursing more  And more snakes  I guess  There weren't enough  Not enough snakes  On the plane  You need a lot of snakes  On the plane  It's just one snake  That sucks  And how did he get  On the plane  With the snakes  I don't know  But I'm on a plane  But I'm on a plane  Full of snakes  They must not be liquid  Snakes  Snakes ain't liquid  People are saying  The movie's good

[02:43:00]  But I do  Fucking bitch  Fuck  They treat  They treat niggas  Like shit  Wow  And white people  Especially all white women  Treat anybody  In the service industry  Like garbage  Yeah  There's  Look  There's certain things  That  Look  When you go out  To certain places  Where you should get  Some races  You should get treated  Better in some situations 
[02:43:30]  At a restaurant  White people probably  Should get treated better  As a whole  But at a sneaker store  When I walk into  The footlocker  Or some black girl  Is buying a pair  Of red shoes  To match her earrings  Or her fucking hat  You should  You should push  An annoying white person  Who's really trying  To find out  What the gel is for  In the fucking  Asics  For some nigga  That's getting ready  To just buy the new Jordans  Yeah  Cause they out  You know what I'm saying  Treat me better 
[02:44:00]  At the sneaker store  Treat you better  At the fucking  You feel me  Bank  Treat you better  At the bank  Most likely  You got a better account  Than the average nigga  But there's some things  We do  That we should just  Get treated  Chinese food  How the fuck  Can the bulletproof  Chinese place  Treat me like shit  The bulletproof  Because they need  To be a bulletproof  Chinese place  Yeah  But god bless them  Especially when niggas  Don't  There's nowhere  Where white people shop  Where they say 
[02:44:30]  No credit cards  Where it's cash only  Nowhere  No fucking where  You go places  Niggas put up  With that stupid shit  Cash only  Really  This is illegal  There's places  With no credit cards  Dude  Cash  Fucking only  And then some  That tell you  You can't  It's illegal  To say there's an amount  That you'd not be able  To charge  There's no limit  I actually ate at  An Italian joint  Over the weekend  Cash only  Really  That's about right  Yeah occasionally  Food restaurants  You're right  Peter Luger's 
[02:45:00]  Is cash only  It's a very famous  Peter Luger's  Is cash only  Steak joint  How the fuck  Can they get away  With that shit  They don't want to  Pay a percentage  To your credit card company  That's right  Cash only  They're allowed to do that  So they can just  Turn down that shit  Because a lot of them  Don't want to pay a percentage  Because you've got to pay  A little bit of 3%  Or whatever  A lot of them won't take Amex  Because they charge  A higher percentage  I got an Italian joint  Cash only  Nobody carries money  Especially Peter Luger's  The end of the bill  Is $300  Yeah exactly  Honestly this Italian joint  The sauce is amazing  I avoid the place  Because of the cash only  And only go there  Once in a while  But he don't care 
[02:45:30]  Because I think  There's something else  Going on  But damn  The food is delicious  Dude I carry so much cash  I don't care  Oh Jimmy  Just willy nilly  Never say that  It's falling out of your pockets  As you walk  Throw hundreds  Not that $20 meal  Sometimes you fucking  You know  Sometimes you  Cash  You know sometimes  Meals be a hundred  And some odd  Yeah yeah  Cash only  That's a little rough  I fucking love Chinese food  And you end up  You know you pay  A hundred and something dollars  And to be honest  The one that I go to 
[02:46:00]  Where I go  Only go there  Because they somewhat  Treat me  Fucking decent  Hey we got a Chinese  Brought on the line  What is she mad?

[02:46:30]  On the conversation  Y'all are having  I am treated like shit  By Asian people  I was adopted  When I was like  One years old  From Korea  Raised by white people  All that  And I swear to god  They can tell  I went to go get  My nails done  Last week  Made an appointment  For 3.30  Got there  Weren't ready  Waited for a half an hour  White girl comes walking in  And they took the white bitch  Before they took me  I've been sitting there  For a half an hour  They love white people  They do  And I  Like when I made the appointment 
[02:47:00]  On the phone  They were nice as hell to me  I come in there  They barely say  Like anything to me  Pips me off  But you know what  Over there  Don't they treat each other  Like shit  Like sweat shops  And they have little kids  Taking out like  Lithium batteries  And chewing them  Like they're  They're just  I'm not humane  Why would they  Make them chew them  Battery gum  Just  Like  Because they're trying  To save that  I think there's  A little piece of gold  Inside any TV set 
[02:47:30]  That keeps  Yeah yeah  So they have them like  Picking off the little pieces  Of gold  Fucking gum  Kids with their  Fucking brains  What was the other question  What was the other question  Well she's adopted  So it doesn't  Oh okay  She's adopted  Hey Renee  You should see Patrice  He's going to be in the area  DC Improv  Yeah  Over the weekend  Coming up  Oh like  Mitch Fatale  The other weekend  Yeah we're thinking  About going down there  Don't even think about it  Patrice rules  Especially Washington  It's his favorite place  I'm so racist  Against adopted Asians  That's what I'm going to tell you 
[02:48:00]  You would never give  A black man a chance  Would you  That's not true at all  Oh  A lot of laughing  In that  You see how beautiful  Asian and black babies are though  They're gorgeous  Yeah  Think about it  They got a nice combo  Going on right  Think about it  Tomorrow  Lisa  She's hot  Put a little  You mix  The Koreans  With a little  Something else  And wow  What comes out  Is nice  Except for having  A shit beat out  Of you in school  Yeah 
[02:48:30]  That's a little bit  Take a Korean girl  And mix her with anything  And you're going to have  A nice looking baby  Oh man  Is that a miserable woman  That's communism though man  That's one thing about America  That picture smells like communism  We put in the market  On fucking laughter  And smiles  Yeah  These fucking people  Third  Third world  Women are miserable  Which means  Their men  Are fucking horrible 
[02:49:00]  Today  Look at them  Look at her  You think she's ever left  She's not getting  She's never had a big cock  Or seen one  No  She's being fucked  By a horrible small dick  With fucking  That horrible  Fish breath  Her rotten husband  With his straight pubes  She gets a horrible fuck  Every night  With his blurred out dick  That  In that little boxy  One room house  With his mosaic dick  That she can't even really see  Now Patrice  Going back to the restaurant  And he's saying 
[02:49:30]  You know  He worked in the industry  And he says  Blacks are the worst tippers  I'm going to say this  But if you're going to the same joint  Over and over again  That takes it out of the equation  Thank you so much  But  They have to be acknowledging  You know  What kind of tip  You're looking after a while  You gotta understand  Tipping at  What Jimmy calls  Having a gentleman's meal  Okay  Tipping at a place  With a gentleman's meal  Some people  Right  They go there  I'm tipping  What's a gentleman's meal  Like a steak joint  Or something  Steak  Well you know it's nice  It's a nice meal  Gentleman's atmosphere 
[02:50:00]  It's a gentleman's meal  Okay  What about a shitty Chinese restaurant  A shitty  Now a shitty Chinese restaurant  Everybody good  It's  First of all  Not everybody  And I'm telling you  Growing up the way I grew up  Tipping  That's not the thing  Okay  Secondly  It's very  Sometimes it's difficult  Math wise  To even know  So if you go  Sometimes a motherfucker  Will pay  Fifty  And go  Well  Five  Like  They don't know 
[02:50:30]  Twenty times  You know  Ten  It's ten  So a lot  Of times  You go out  With cash  And you go  To Red Lobster  You have  Sixty dollars  The bill  Comes to  Fifty eight  Ninety five  Here's your sixty  Keep the two  A lot of people  Don't know  A lot of people  If they knew  They would  Fucking tip  And they would  They would plan  For fucking tipping  It's easy  Move the decimal  One place to the left  And then double it  We continue  With more of our  Tribute to Patrice O'Neal  Hello everyone 
[02:51:00]  This is Danny  From the Opie and Anthony  Show  And we're all  Talking about Patrice  Today  And something that  I remembered about Patrice  That I kind of wanted  To share with everybody  Was just his mastery  Of the moment  On stage  Where he couldn't  Let anything get to him  And if he felt  That he was  Bothered  Or some people  That were in the front  Were bothering him  He just couldn't  Be shaken  And I'll never forget  One time I was down  At Stand Up New York  Specifically to see Patrice 
[02:51:30]  And there was a table  Of probably  Seven or eight  Girls  You know  Young women  Probably early 20s  For some girls  Night out thing  And they were just  Yapping and making  Noise and everything  And Patrice  This is one of the  Most brilliant things  I've ever seen  By a comedian  To get his way  On that stage  And he basically  Singled out  The prettiest girl  From that group  And flirted with her  And then just bought  Her and only her  The rest of her  Drinks for the night  It was  The most brilliant  Instance of 
[02:52:00]  Divide and conquer  To get his own  Way on stage  All he wanted  Was to shut  This group of  Women up  And he did so  On his terms  And I thought  That was  That was just  A brilliant thing  Stay tuned  Our tribute  Continues with  More moments  From Patrice O'Neill  On the Opie  And Anthony show  After this  We continue  With more of our  Tribute to Patrice O'Neill  Hey it's Sam Roberts  From this show  Obviously we lost  A great one  In Patrice O'Neill  He's probably  The closest 
[02:52:30]  Of all the friends  To the show  He was probably  The closest  I know  Up until his  Last appearance  He was the one guy  That pretty much  All of us on staff  Were still  Elated the night  Before he was coming in  We knew  It would always be  A good show  Whenever Patrice was in  He's a guy  Who would  It's a lot easier  To celebrate  His life now  And do it  As much as  We're doing it  Because  We really celebrated  His life  While he was still 
[02:53:00]  Alive  And we did that  In the sense  Of bringing him  Into the studio  Every time we could  Have him in  Giving him  The reign  To do whatever  He wanted  And I mean  Letting the audience  Get to know him  Like I feel like  As a fan  And I said this  On the after show  Before we're all  Kind of blessed  To have  Gotten to be a part  Of getting to know  Who he was  As a comedian  On the show  Just listening in  And getting to watch  Him develop 
[02:53:30]  Into this  Amazing comedian  That only would  Have continued  To do more  I'm so thankful  For not only  Getting to hear that  But every  Just being able  To have conversations  With him  Is something  That I know  I'm going to be  Able to be happy  About for the rest  Of my life  Because it's  Something that  At this point  Unfortunately not  Everybody will have  Gotten to do  So I'm very happy  To have  That we're getting  To do this special  And let's remember  Patrice O'Neal  Remembering Patrice O'Neal 
[02:54:00]  His greatest moments  On ONA  You uh  Chris you helped  Him too in a weird way  Because when you  Were on the show  At K-Rock with us  And Patrice was in  And it kind of  Turned into an  Intervention  Because you were  Telling him  That you wanted  Him for your show  And you know  He might have  Been hard to be  And you told him  Kind of with love  And that really  I think it changed  Him  It absolutely changed  Him  I love the guy  I  You know  He's just one of  Those guys  That's one of those guys  That the moment  He started getting 
[02:54:30]  Out of his own way  That's exactly it  It was all gonna  Open up for him  And that's what  Was happening  When I was on the show  And by the way  What I did on the show  Is what I did  Every time I saw him  Right  I was like  Money  You're funnier  Than everybody  Jesus  Embrace it  Come in  Smile  Don't worry  The white man  Is not going to  Beat your ass today  It's okay  You know 
[02:55:00]  He loved putting  A spark to a bridge  Though  He loved putting  A spark to a bridge  Oh boy  Burn a bridge  Like that guy  Amazing  And it was  Fucking hilarious  But like  Oh so you'd just  Be like  What are you doing  Why  It's like cross it first  Then burn it  Yeah  Yeah that really did  Help Patrice  I think  When Chris  That day he was in  Because it got to him  Because Chris wasn't  Coming at him  Like you asshole  He was like  I wanted to give you  It was extremely real  Remember  Yeah  And I think  We were like  Whoa  And I think  Patrice  Listened too 
[02:55:30]  You know what  One of the only times  You've watched Patrice  Actually sit back  And listen  And now  Chris Rock joins  The program  What  Am I on  Yeah now you're on  Sorry  See  We can't even figure out  Which mic works  The last day  Before vacation  I realize it's just  The same as like  School  Remember in school  Before vacation  Or before you  Left for summer  Nothing got done  I know nothing  About school  That's exactly  Nothing  School's for white people  Well I sure missed it 
[02:56:00]  Books and learning  Maybe it was  The Sicilian in me  I missed it  A lot of it  I just went for  The first half  To learn a little bit  Of math  And some English  Shop skills  And then  And move on  I have better things  To do  Yeah  This is Chris's  First time here  And uh  This is my first time  Yeah  And uh  Him and Patrice  Were talking about something  And apparently  He complimented Patrice  And I gotta say  I didn't like it  Let me say this  It was a weird thing  I'm sitting there  The first part of the story  To  It was 
[02:56:30]  I thought  Somebody's just  Started in trouble  And I thought  It's Chris  Well retell the story  I'll make believe  I didn't hear this  Well  Because it was really good  During the break  I had to say  Thank  I had to thank him  Because  One comic said  That Chris  Chris Rock said  That you auditioned  For  Everybody hates Chris  As the father  Talking about me  And said  I was awful  I go  I go  No  I was good  At that audition  So  So  I  So  Keith called me  Keith was there  So Keith goes  Ah man  No no no no 
[02:57:00]  He didn't say that at all  He said you were great  And he told me  The real story  And I'm just  This is  You were great  You just didn't know  Any of your lines  But I mean  You were very  You were very unprepared  You were very  Oh jeez  Self  Deprecating  But you were great  You were  Actually the best  Word that day  I could have got  The father  But I  I thought I knew  My lot  Put it this way  I always say  In auditions  I gave myself  A chance to get it  But I'm very  Aloof  In auditions  Because I don't 
[02:57:30]  Want to get too  Like I want it  Or too  I don't want it  I went in  So why try  Him and all  I was just saying  This is how I'm  Going to be as a father  But the word was  Okay  He was the best  But he didn't get it  Because of some other stuff  But I actually felt good  About that  That I was the best  So you finally got  An opportunity to ask  Chris if that was  Oh you were great  But here's the thing  I heard  Is that I had  An attitude  And I didn't  I know when I have  An attitude  I'm not going to say 
[02:58:00]  I'm not an ass  I didn't have an attitude  You came in  I feel like  This is good  This is good stuff  This is like  I feel like  Mr. Slate  Like I'm Trump  The reason you were  Let go  But I don't like  To give  I don't like  To give  Wait a minute  Wait a minute  I don't like  To give  Just let me finish  Let the man finish  I don't  I don't like  To give  I don't like  To give  Black bosses  Any less  Type of respect  Than white bosses 
[02:58:30]  I don't want  To look at Chris  And go  Ah  Chris  And when I go  Into white  Things  And I'm acting  I'm acting right  I went in there  To try to be  Business act right  How many black bosses  Have you really been  In front of the road  You're saying  Like there's so many  Black bosses out there  You act like  You're popular  Among white people  When have you ever  Been like  Nice or diplomatic  I want it to be  The same  Exactly the same  Yeah  Wow  And  Why don't you  Why don't you  Why don't you  Kiss up to Chris Rock 
[02:59:00]  He's in the studio  He doesn't have to  Kiss up to me  You're self-destructive  I'm not self-destructive  Look who's telling you that  Right  I know a thing about  Being self-destructive  I think you're being  A little self-destructive  You're being a little  Too cool for the room  In front of Chris Rock  Too cool  What are you talking about  Now  Yeah  But don't think  Me and Chris  Don't both know  White tricks  This is not dividing  I basically said  Thank you for the  Call  Because I heard  The compliment  I thank you 
[02:59:30]  So his acting  Was good  His acting  Was very good  His acting  Was very good  He just didn't  He didn't know  The part  And he was very  He was just  Killing himself  He was basically  Screaming  Don't hire me  Oh  Patrice  You know something  That's the  Patrice  We know  That sounds just like  Patrice  This is the man  We know  I swear to God  Absolutely  Sounds just like him  I know when I'm  Being like that  But I wasn't  Against was like  I'm ready to do this  I know every lot  And he probably  Wasn't as good  As Patrice  But he was  Wow  He was so like 
[03:00:00]  Oh man  I will do everything  You need to do  Mr. Rock  You know what  Don't worry about it  It's not like  It's a hit show  Yeah it's not like  You see the  Bus boards  And the billboards  I saw your  E-True Hollywood story  You were the same way  I was  I was  And I straightened out  Oh  Alright  That's his advice  I'm going to try  You should learn  From Chris  I'm learning from Chris  I'm going to learn now  Terry Crews  This was great  But you were really good  How many seasons  Are you in on that show?  We're I think  We just finished three 
[03:00:30]  Yeah so we're going to start four  Last four seasons  What do you do?  What do you do?  Is that why you asked  The next question?  Of course we did  Actually no I never heard that story  Until you said that  No I wouldn't rub it  I'm happy that I heard that  Syndication  I was wondering  When you go into a show  With that star  Is like a kid  Do you think  Ah if we get a year  Out of this  We're lucky  And now you must start thinking  This kid's getting older  He's really old  And his voice is changed  And he's shaven  Yeah it's like  He's got hemorrhoids  You got the Harry Potter problem 
[03:01:00]  Yeah we got the  Well I wish  Well that's some problem  That's a good problem  How  It happened with like  The wonder years and stuff  Where I think they go into it  Thinking  We're lucky if it's even  On the air  And then it gets to the part  Where it's like  Dad I'm home  And it's not quite  The wonder years anymore  You know  It's not this innocent  Child thing  Now he's you know  Driving and  Having sex  Sleeping with his aunt  Yeah  Exactly  And his show  Everybody Loves Chris  Was one of the few ones  That made the leap 
[03:01:30]  When they combined  To make the CW  When UPN closed down  Oh that's right  And his and like  A couple others  Were the only ones  That moved over  To the new network  Yes because all the shows  Were so great  They had to  What's gonna make it  That was just  You could hear the  Collective click  Of white people  Hitting the remotes  On some of those shows  It's like  There's four girls  And they're  Living together  And they're working  I have no idea  What that's about  Click  Yeah 
[03:02:00]  I had no real  Interest in seeing that  What  Why don't you just  Start it with  I'm a racist  Yeah  I didn't say  I'm a racist  I like my shows  With a black friend  That's what you're  Really saying  An occasional black  Friend is great  On the show  You know  He has one  He has one  Important scene  Every season  That's where I feel  Anthony goes  In my safe zone  Sticks from happy days  Right  Still sticks 
[03:02:30]  Look  What happened  In those days  Anthony goes  I'm not watching  UPN word  I don't call it that  Jesus Christ  I just need something  I can relate to  A little  Us as humans  We're just watching  Things we can relate  To a little more  It's like Steve Nash  You want to see you  Just so Chris  Understands  It's like Nash  Right  Anthony  Yes  You root for Nash  Right  Of course you root for Nash  Anthony's a big fan  Oh my god  I root for Nash 
[03:03:00]  Anthony's a big fan  Of the history channel  But he likes to call it  The Hitler channel  Just so you know  Who you're dealing with  Well it's the big age  In the corner and stuff  Of course  And no  I'm a fan of the era  Right  It's amazing  Hitler can have a channel  And OJ can't get a channel  OJ only killed two people  They're fascinated with Hitler  Hitler gets a whole channel  Networks  Every bit of film  Of that guy  Has been shown  Everything  He's a drug addict  There's no  Hitler outtakes  I saw one the other day 
[03:03:30]  Hitler went sandal shopping  Really  Yeah some rare footage  A whole hour  Of Hitler  They find two lousy seconds  Of Hitler footage  And they make an hour  Out of it  On the Hitler channel  OJ nothing  Nothing for OJ  Nothing for OJ  Hey Chris is playing the guard  We gotta get the plug  Yeah man  It's amazing  To be doing that room  It's funny  I think we're off the air  We said this  But I'm like  Is this your  Are you doing  The two rooms  The little garden  I'm doing the  Dane Cook garden  The Dane Cook garden  Oh my god  It's renamed  That is the elephant  In the room too 
[03:04:00]  Because you're sitting there  Going how do you ask  Somebody  Are you playing  The real garden garden  Or the other thing  But the other thing  Is 5,000 seats  It's so impressive  Yeah that's the mini garden  Okay so you're doing  Four nights  Four nights  Jesus  How come I do  One big garden  Because that adds up  To Ford or the little garden  There's like  Insurance issues  Let me explain  A real  You gotta  Look Chris  You gotta explain  The normal  I know  When you're settling up  At the chuckle hut 
[03:04:30]  At the end of the night  I'm sitting there  You sit there  Settling up  With the guy  I don't know  I'm really asking  Like I don't know  From the rainy night house  And you're going over  Tony Camacho  Has the check  Do you ask him  Not to drop checks  John Mulrooney  Is working with you  Do you ask him  Not to drop checks  Big up to Mulrooney  Do they have wings  At the garden  We might have rings  I've been trying  To get Kentucky Fried Chicken 
[03:05:00]  To give out  Two pieces  At the end of the night  I wonder if you  You might make more  Doing four nights  At the other one  You can make more money  Yeah  Because the union  Very expensive New York rooms  Are very expensive  I mean I understand  Some of the big rooms  This is all business  It's not that of course  It's all business  Yes yes  Something you don't know  Nothing about  I'll be at comics  Next week  I'm trying to sell  Four shows  Patrice decided  It was a good idea  To get a website  A mere three months ago  Wow  Remember all the times  You would come on the show  And like  See that's how  You get the show  Exactly  That's how he did 
[03:05:30]  He doesn't know how to promote  He goes  I feel weird promoting  Do you see I'm trying now  You are trying  Jesus  Patrice's brilliance  As a comedian  You're playing some  Big rooms now right  You know I'll get back to you  Yes  It's funny  As a business fan  It's time to plug myself  Yeah I'm doing  Maybe a thousand  Is probably the maximum  That's so funny  Hey you're out to clubs  Yeah  You made it  That's the goal  Of every comic  Is to get out  Of the chuckle huts  My only goal  I swear to you 
[03:06:00]  Was to be famous enough  To not have to do radio  That was it  Not that I'm going to be up now  But I mean  Right  Yeah  I don't have to do radio  And I don't have to stay  In the condo  In the comedian condo  That's all I wanted  I knew you were on the road  I wanted to be like  Down my era  George Wallace  Was my goal  He's been on the show  A bunch  Yeah  That was my goal  Yeah  Shot past that  We should talk about  We should talk about  The condo thing  A lot of people out there  Don't understand  When you guys go to these cities 
[03:06:30]  You have to stay in the same condo  That other comics were in  A week before  The same sheets  Right  Because they're trying  To just save  They're trying to save money  So these guys buy an actual condo  The comedians are disgusting  Right  I can't even imagine  You got to share  You got to share  Sometimes with  I've done so many gigs  With a headliner  In the middle act  Sometimes you have to share  If you're not a headliner  You share the room  With the  Some strange comic  You barely know  Like damn near bunk beds  Right  It's like  Ah  Disgusting  Yeah I've done that  I woke up one time  It was three comedians 
[03:07:00]  In a room  And I woke up  And the two guys had left  We had like a two hour drive  To the next game  And they just left a note  Like we'll meet you there  Dirt bags  You ever had that thing  Where you're at the club  And they have  They have the meal  The menu  And then there's the stuff  The headliner can eat  But if you're an opener  Oh no way  You can't get shrimp  You know  Oh my god  The chintzy ass  What crap is that  We don't  The middles can't get scallops  We're sorry  You can have the chicken wings  Chicken wings for you  I was doing a club recently  Up in Massachusetts 
[03:07:30]  And they said that the MC  The opening acts  Couldn't get soda  I'm like you don't give  The guys  I can see alcohol  You know what I don't like  Wow  I saw one that said  Don't touch the waitresses  Was that a problem  You know what's bothering me  About this conversation  What  That Norton and Chris Rock  Are having a nostalgic conversation  That I still live  If you had the right attitude  You're as funny as both of us  I'm not going to sit here 
[03:08:00]  And say I'm funnier than you  I guess it's time to tell you  This is an intervention for you  We thought we were having Chris Rock  To promote his New Year's gig  But it's really an intervention  To get you on the right track  How do people be able to move on  From old school news  I'm not like that  I'll tell you what it is  As a comedian  You're like Whitney Houston  You're going to have to be clean  For ten years  Before we buy it  Like we're supposed to just buy it now  But she's looking good again  Yeah yeah  She's looking good  You've got to prove it to the public  I need four crackless albums 
[03:08:30]  To buy that club  I'm going to have to be like Michael Vick  After he gets out  Like I'm going to take care of dogs  You're going to work at his shelter  You've got to pet every dog you see  Walking by  You're going to have to shake hands  With a few audience members  As they walk out  Thank the club owner for having you  Because it's not your act  People love your act  People love your act  It's who you are  They hate you  Garbage  They just hate you as a person  This is your intervention  I've been waiting for this day  There is no awful human beings 
[03:09:00]  I'm a good person  I'm just  It's just  You've got to think about you  That's what it is  I can name ten guys  You're funnier  And you know what  You know what  This is how you know  You're way more successful than you  This is  Chris  Chris is talking to me  Like a middle aged white man  That's how middle aged white people talk to me  You know I'm finished  Because Chris is like  Look my son  You need to work on this  If you think it's just jokes  You got  Jokes are only half the battle 
[03:09:30]  This is  Every conversation you have about Patrice  Goes like this  He's a funny guy  This is years ago  This is in the mid 90's  This was  I used to do this  I met him  I hated Patrice  He's pomposity  I met him  And he was like  We're doing this hell gig  For Jamie Dukin  It was a college  I was opening  You keep telling that story  I killed at that room  You didn't kill at that room  It doesn't matter  It's not about the comedy  It's not about the jokes  It's the delusion of who he is 
[03:10:00]  I had maybe a one  Help me help you  He's Rod Tidwell  I like to see him sweat  It's rare you sweat  On our show  I'm a breather  I guess it's Chris O'Neill  Nobody's got a bad thing to say  No  Not as funny  Just my essence  Stinks  Before they trash you  They'll say things like  Yeah he's funny 
[03:10:30]  Are you friends with him?  Patrice O'Neill  Will not be at the garden  He'll be at the undergarden  Chris Rock wants to make it  Perfectly clear  He doesn't want you  Tainting his garden appearance  There's the 5,000  There's the 20,000  And then there's the bathroom  Oh poor Patrice  Hey are you working  With anybody at the garden? 
[03:11:00]  Jill Scott  Jill Scott for the ladies  She's opening?  Yeah she's opening  Wow  I don't know Jill Scott  I don't either  Okay  I want to find out about  If you're having sex  With a black woman  You'd know  Yeah?  Oh yeah  She's big  Yeah  Neo soul as they used to call it  Oh wait  She's the performer  She does music  Yeah yeah  Alright I know who  Oh she's not a comic?  No no  Oh you was thinking  Comedian Jill Scott  I was thinking  Comedian Jill Scott  I've heard of Jill Scott  Yeah yeah  I don't really know what she  I just know she's in music  That's smart  Have music in front of you  Because this way  You don't have to worry  When somebody's stepping  On everything you want  To talk about 
[03:11:30]  Exactly  That's why Pryor did it  With Patti LaBelle  Exactly  I'm going to start  Doing that music  When I saw Dane Cook  In the garden  It was just him and a stool  Yep  No opening act  Nothing  Hour and a half  Dane just came out  Yeah  I'm like wow  That's pretty pompous  Hey  Not even a warm up  35 minutes of scream  Right right  Give us a bed or something  To hang out with  For a while  I hate working in the round  Not that I have an opportunity  To do it  Believe me I very rarely  Shut up stupid  You're not in the round yet  Not even  You can't count the  Westbury Music Fair  I'm only doing half 
[03:12:00]  Believe me every time  I'm in the round  There's a curtain  It's like wow  We felt it'd be more intimate  You're in the crescent  And no one wants  To see your back  You were getting to something  Oh yeah yeah  When you hosted the Oscars  All we had to hear  Was from Rich Voss  About how he was writing  For Chris Rock  I love it  I love it  Finally  And all I wanted to do  He might have got a couple  In there  Did he  Yeah I think he got 
[03:12:30]  He bragged about that  For a year  He got a couple  Like in the intros  Yeah  Yeah  All he was talking about  Though is  Well I gotta  Get over  And I see Chris  Where I'm writing  It's like what do you  What could you possibly  Be writing  He would call us from LA  And between writing sessions  And just talk about that  Make sure everyone knew  What he was doing  Every time we talked to him  He had to bring that up  Yeah  And it's still one of his big credits  How long after you hired Voss  Did you realize  Alright this was a mistake  He's a nice guy  But he contributes very little  And he's dumb  He'd have some stuff 
[03:13:00]  Dumb as dirt  He'd have some stuff  I forgot you hosted man  That was so great  It was so fun to watch  It was so great  They never called again  Good though  What the hell was that about  Wait wait  Did it again  Hold on  I'll tell you what that's about  That means you did a great job  As a comedian  No I'm serious  You were a comedian  Doing the Oscars  It was great to watch  Just smashing them  I love that  That stupid Jude Law  Oh who is he  That was so great  And then Sean Pan  He's one of our finest  Shut your mouth  One of our finest actors  And what a sense of humor  That guy's got  Chris will say it 
[03:13:30]  Sean should have taken the  You know  Take the joke  Oh what a douche  It was just nice  It was just nice to see  A comic doing that  And not being polite to them  But really tearing their throat  Absolutely  It was great man  Thank you  Could you hang for a little longer  Patrice see how I said thank you  Wait a minute  Let me practice  That goes a long way  That goes a long way  Patrice  Thank you Chris  See I'm going to follow it  Let me just practice  Saying thank you to people  Just say something to me  Owen  I don't have anything  I can say to you  It's okay  Thanks anyway for 
[03:14:00]  I'm trying to learn  Instead of going  This is Patrice  And to compliment him  Because he is a sweet guy  But he doesn't  He doesn't want anyone  To know that  He's got that  Tough outer shell  That you gotta break through  If you said Patrice  That hosting job you did  Was so good that one time  Shut up  Right right  That's Patrice  Patrice doesn't realize  He doesn't realize  He's a big black man  So he thinks he's going  Hey how you doing  But what we hear  Right now  Thank you so much  For the opportunity  People who don't like Patrice 
[03:14:30]  Hate him  Because he gets to people  Because if he teases you  He's loud  You're not going to be  Louder than he is  I never realized  He couldn't take  A compliment properly  Because I had  Complimented you  On your appearances  On the office  Even though  They were very brief  But you were very good  Can I tell you  Really quickly  People always  When they write  Patrice  They make sure  They can write him out  Too  I don't know 
[03:15:00]  How this is going to work  Put a pre-existing  Medical condition  In the character description  It starts off  With diabetes  In the show  He's boisterous  With a heart condition  Just in case  That fun loving  Weak hearted man  It starts off  With diabetes  And a doctor's appointment  First episode  First episode  You could go into a coma  In season two  They don't want to lose  A minute of production time  If you're lucky  Oh man 
[03:15:30]  Actually  Arrested Development too  I love that show  I think I got thrown out of there  For the same reason  Why  I don't think  I said thank you  Yeah  See that's your problem  What are you going to do  I don't  What are you  Just  See  Just be nice  I think we only  You have to be somewhere  We only have you for another ten minutes  Whatever you need  I'm here  Can we take a quick break  And then continue  For you  Sure  Oh wow  And he doesn't like doing radio  So that's a compliment  Who does  Jesus Christ  That's too early  Do that one more time  For you  See I know  See there was nothing in me 
[03:16:00]  To even know  To say that  That was just acting though  But it was  That wasn't sincere  That was just acting  No but I know  That's what he's saying  We continue to celebrate  The life of Patrice O'Neal  God damn  With more of his greatest moments  On the Opie and Anthony show  Next  We continue  With more of our tribute  To Patrice O'Neal  Hey it's Travis  From the Opie and Anthony show  I think the thing  That I'm going to miss  Most about Patrice  Is that 
[03:16:30]  He would always call me  For some reason  To get booked on the show  He knew that Roland  Was the booker  But for some reason  He would always call me  And you know  We'd talk our business  And then we would just  Sometimes end up  Talking about nothing  For 30 minutes  And those  Those little things  Just talking to him  During commercial breaks  About you know  Him and Sam  Would talk about wrestling  Or we'd talk about  Video games  And it's just  You're not going to  Come across  A nicer guy  In 
[03:17:00]  In this business  And it's really  It's really sad  That he's gone  And  And life's really unfair  And this is one of those  One of those times  That  That it's really unfair  And  And this is everyone's loss  This isn't just  The loss  Of  Of the comedy world  Or  Or the Opie and Anthony show  This is  Everyone's loss  And I think  We all see that  So  We're all really 
[03:17:30]  Going to miss him  Remembering Patrice O'Neal  His greatest moments  On ONA  He loved Pat Cooper too  And Pat liked him a lot  They were great  On top crowd together  And we had both of them  Oh were they in together  Oh fuck yeah  Yeah they were  They worked well together  Two fucking loud guys  Patrice would just start  Railing on him  Oh it was great  Pat loved him  Let's get Pat Cooper in here  Before he fucking  Loses his mind  I hear he's yelling  And screaming  Roland was he yelling  And screaming down the hall  Oh sorry  Oh look  Very calm  I know right

[03:28:00]  What do you think about  Joan Rivers  You ever like her  I will say this about  Joan Rivers  This is a talented lady  I don't like her personally  But that's beside the point  If you're talking about her talent  Yes  But now she's getting  On my fucking nerves  Really  Now she's on slides  She's on television  She's on radio  She's gone to walking  But she's such an unhappy  Unhappy lady  That's what we said  And she does not like  To be told  Because she can't take it  She likes to give it  She can't take it 
[03:28:30]  But I'd say this  She's a talented lady  That's it  Yeah I saw a documentary on her  And she just looks like  She never stops  She's constantly on the go  And didn't look very happy  No  Because she's  When you cover your heart  Your heart don't pump right  See she thinks  By changing her face  That's changing her  She's still a rat bastard  And that's what's gonna happen  You can't hide rat bastard  You can't have a rat bastard ectomy  I'm calling women rat bastards  Rat bastard  But she's a talented lady  And she's just

[03:59:00]  A fulfilling  Empty shit  Like that  Like it  It got out  And it's shaped  Like a colon  You were full  Now you're not  Tapered at both ends  I'm obsessed with  Taking a good shit now  Cause I just  That's where you end up  I'm a fucking  Just a curmudgeon  No friends  No fucking  I'm happy about  Shits  I'm gonna stop  I'm worried about 
[03:59:30]  Falling and not  Getting up  You gotta need  A life call  I need a life call  Jesus  I don't know man  I suck  I hate the commercials  Where there's  An old man  An old woman  They're fucking  You know  At least in their  70s  And they're doing  Their canoeing  Or something  And they look  At the camera  And they're like  These are the  Best years of our lives  And you just look like  You're so full of  Fucking shit 
[04:00:00]  You diaper wear  And it's for a diaper  It's for fucking  Like bladder control shit  These are the  Best years of my life  And I'm enjoying them  It's like  Fuck you  You were at Woodstock  You idiot  What are you talking about  Yeah how about when you were  Fucking  Splayed open  In the back seat  Of a fucking  A rumble seat  In a car  Just getting plowed  By some  Dick was  Fucking  Fonzie  When you had the  Greatest dick of all time  Yeah there's what you want  And the pussy was good  Oh and the pussy was tight  Like a fucking  Like a little neck clam  Now you see these two old people 
[04:00:30]  Yeah  We're looking at two old people  Sitting there  Getting dialysis or something  Now let me ask you  If they're together forever  Like meaning  Who hates more  Who hates who more  I mean  If you're together forever  Yeah  Since you were young  And good looking  Does her face  And his face  Look exactly  Like it does  Oh right  Like how they just  Look like two old farts  Because if you look at someone  Every day  You don't notice  They're changing  Is she as ugly  To him 
[04:01:00]  Or is that the same  Beautiful shit bag  Or does she  Look like the same woman  That was waiting for him  When he got off the boat  From Europe  Is she  When he dipped her  In Times Square  And gave her a kiss  With her rubber face  And her fucking  Giant  Newborn  Fucking  Horse knuckles  They look like  Newborn horse knees  Her big arthritic  Fucking knuckles  Looks like  Thoroughbred  Fucking joints  How come 
[04:01:30]  Father time  How come  Father time  Couldn't just do this  You're gonna be  Healthy  Healthy  Healthy  Healthy  Healthy  Healthy  Beautiful  Then die  Like  It is pretty twisted  You just go  You're gonna die  In 80 years  You're gonna expire  Like a battery  As opposed to  Regress  What year do you think  Your body starts dying  It's the second  You come out of the  Fucking world  I don't know about that  You're decomposing 
[04:02:00]  No because  Having a son  I don't believe that anymore  Because  If he gets a cut  Or something  It heals  Within hours  It's creepy  So when does your body  Like make that  That turn  No I would say  Instantly  Instantly  Through cell regeneration  You're using up  Your resources  No no no  I see what  You're growing  I know what  He's trying to say  He's saying  You're being  You're being  Literal  Literal  Okay  He's saying  When do you  Start to regress  To 40 
[04:02:30]  I would say  45  I think there's  I would say  40  I think  Do you see  Anywhere between  40  Hold on  Hold on  I think  I think  There's a  When you're  You're born  You're developing  And  You know what I mean  And maturing  Meaning  And then it's like  There's gotta be an age  Where the human being  Is perfect  There's a click up  It's a roller coaster  It's perfectly made  Everything is  Great  The skin looks good  Your bone structure  Your fucking muscles  And then  22 years old  22 is a great age 
[04:03:00]  I wonder if there's  A real answer to this  The click up  The  The flying down  Is 40  30  Is the  Click click  Is that  The click click  The peak at the top  And you stand in  You survey the greatness  Of 30  And then 40  Is  It's not  It's fucking  You gotta go to the bathroom  Four times a fucking night  Because the obvious shit  Is like  Your skin starts sagging  A little bit  The gray hair starts coming in  That's what I'm talking about 
[04:03:30]  That's how you see this  Gotcha  A little bit  It's fucking  It's 40  Yeah you got a little bit  Up front  Right  When did you have to  Start going to get  My touch ups for television  How old were you  When things was  Happening bad up there  Oh god  Well the good thing was  I had a nice  Slow fucking thinning  Of my hair  It was over the course  Of many years  And you had a thick mane  I had crazy  Afro fucking hair  Dude he  But then I started noticing  Like alright  Let's get a little thin  And went out without a hat  The other night  He's got a full head of hair now 
[04:04:00]  I've seen him on  Joey Bayar  It's looking good  But  It's kind of creepy  Without the help of money  And science  Without $12,000  Yes  What where  Oh I would be  Fucking  Well receded  On the side  I'd probably have a  Phil Collins up front  And I'd have a  George Costanza  In the back  How old are you Danny  I'll be 30 in a few weeks  You'll be 30  So you started going  Early  You know what  It's been  It's just been  A slow decline  Slow decline 
[04:04:30]  Yeah  You know  You notice  You notice  You notice  Things are changing  Like you know  For me  I don't know  10 years ago  Like I noticed  There's a little  Something going on  And it just  What is that  Now how about  Your body  Very slow  Do you feel  As good as you do  When you was  When you was 20  No but that's my own fault  Because I don't do anything  I feel like things  Changed for me  When I turned 30  30 was  Yeah  30 was changing  I just felt like  I couldn't like  Do a lot of the shit  I used to do  That was the prime  Of my life  Health wise  30  From 30  I think it was  Psychological though  45 was awful 
[04:05:00]  For me  It was just  A complete decline  From 35 to 45  I would say  Awful because  I did not take care  Yeah look at that  Isn't that wonderful  That's a shadow  Part of the hair  Mind you  To the right  That picture makes me sick  Isn't it terrible  Look at me  I'm an emaciated  I fucking hate you  In this picture  Why are you emaciated  Drugs  You know what  You look like  Your attitude now  Like  You don't look  I think  Oh you are perfect  If you look like that

[04:11:00]  With like the whole time thing  Yeah because I'm just like  We're constantly  I mean just as human beings  We really are  Some more than others  But I even think the ones that  Come across like they're not  Are  When I had 62 year old people died  I go  Oh man  At 20 you go  What difference does it make  You're ready to die anyway  You old piece of shit  Now I'm like  Oh no  I used to think  How long it would take  Like and I'm talking  When I was 
[04:11:30]  Probably when I was like  10 years old  I would think how long  It was going to be  Until I was 40  And it's like  Oh my god  And I would sit there  Going like  I have to go through  Like 1970  1, 2, 3, 4, 5  And these are all years  I know how long a year is  And I'm counting it off like that  And it's like  God that'll be forever  And then all of a sudden  You're there  This is the  This is the most fucked up thing  About age  You don't change  You just get older 
[04:12:00]  Like so  At 20  Right  You're just young  And delicious  But at 40  At 40  You're not  You're not  There's guys in high school  I still hate  With the same passion  Like you would think  You get mature  And blah blah blah  You think something changes  But you fucking  You are the same person  You was  Yes  Except for now  You're fucking 40  Yes  You got the same likes  And dislikes 
[04:12:30]  And a few little  Incidental things change  Like oh I like  Brussels sprouts now  But other than that  You're the same  Motherfucker  Your laugh doesn't change  No  Like you don't start laughing  You're like  Ho ho  Ho ho  Ho ho  Ho ho  Ho ho  Ho ho  Ho ho  Jocularity  Jocularity  You don't become a man  Like  I still look at men  And then go  Fuck he's a man  I'm 40  I get  I want somebody  To praise me  When I fill my gas tank 
[04:13:00]  Like if I fill my gas tank  I go  Somebody should just  Why don't nobody  Just say how responsible  I am  Look at you  With a full gas tank  You've made it Patrice O'Neil  Fucking  When am I going to feel  Like a man  I just paid my bills  This month  You never will  Someone fucking say  Cool  Say wow  Look at you  You never will  We continue  With more of our tribute  To Patrice O'Neil  Hey it's Jim Norton  And I  They asked me last week 
[04:13:30]  To talk about Patrice  For the special  And I didn't  It was just too sad  I didn't know what to say  What memories  Do you share  I have so many  Memories of him  I mean you know  For years and years  And years  One that stands out  For me  And I've told it  On O&A before  Is we've gone to Brazil  Three times  To get hookers together  And  One time  He and I  We were taking  100 milligram Viagras  Every night 
[04:14:00]  We would just take them  Me him  Keith Robinson too  And we would just go  To the whorehouse  Called the Monte Carlo  And we would just  Fuck prostitutes  And I think none of us  Would come until the last one  Because if you  If you came  Your night was over  And I remember  The way the Monte Carlo  Worked is you'd go down  You'd take  You'd change into a robe  And you would put the  Your clothes in a locker  And then you'd take  The elevator up  In your slippers  In your white robe  And that's where  There's photos of Patrice and I  In our white robes  In this whorehouse  And  You stand in this bar area 
[04:14:30]  And these beautiful  Brazilian hookers  Come over  And you can talk to them  Make out with them  At the bar  It's surreal  So one time  Patrice and I  Are there  And I have a  100 milligram  Viagra heart on  And it's just  You can't see my dick  But it's just tenting  The front of my robe  Is tenting out  And Patrice and I  Are just looking  At this erection bulge  In my robe  And we're howling  Like five year olds  We're just giggling  Because what we were doing  The wrongness 
[04:15:00]  Of what we were doing  Was so crystal clear  By my erection  We just couldn't believe  That we had flown  To a third world country  Strictly to get prostitutes  And that's a very  Very vivid memory  And a very  Fun moment  I had with him  And I remember  Every time we were there  Him lugging up this  There's a story  In one of my books  Called Dr. Dildo  Because Patrice would  Take a glass bag  Of dildos  With him  To try to make  These girls come  And so I can remember  Vividly hearing  The clanking glass  Bag of dildos 
[04:15:30]  As he would go  Up in the elevator  Like he would have to go  When he would get a girl  Because he wouldn't  Bring the dildos  Up from the locker  Into the bar area  He would leave them  In the locker  So he would always  Have to go all the way  Down to the locker  Get his glass dildo bag  And then go up  Get the girl  Then go to the room  And then go back down  And put his dildos away  It was a fucking  A process  Whenever we would  Check into the Monte Carlo  Because you'd check in  For the night  Like you know  A few hours  You'd go there  For four or five hours  And just the  We would spend 
[04:16:00]  I think we'd spend  A week or ten days  There each time  We went  At least a week  So those are  Some of my favorite  Memories of him  Was my time  From just being  On vacation with him  And Bobby and Keith  And just  And the laughs we had  But there's too many  Over the years  Like you know  It's hard to talk about  Because you don't  Want to think specifically  It's still kind of  Hard to believe  Like weird moments  Like just kind of  Make it go like  Oh my god  He's dead  Like it's really  Really hard 
[04:16:30]  To wrap your head around  You're not going to  See this person again  So I don't mean to  Ramble  And I wanted to  Do the tribute  But you know  I just  I don't know  What to say  You know  It's just  It's terrible  And I have so many  Amazing memories of him  Thanks  And I'll take with me  The memory  To be my sunshine  After the rain
