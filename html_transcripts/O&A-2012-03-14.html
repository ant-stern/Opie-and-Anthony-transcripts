<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Larry King’s surprisingly enthusiastic intro, despite acknowledging the show’s niche audience.  With Greg Opie absent, Anthony and the remaining hosts discussed Opie's online interactions with Kim Kardashian.  They then reminisced about early internet platforms like GeoCities and Angel Fire, contrasting them with the modern internet. A substantial portion focused on true crime TV, detailing a case involving a woman impersonating her daughter online, resulting in murder and a wrongful conviction.  The hosts analyzed "To Catch a Predator," discussing the perpetrators' reactions and the show's controversial cancellation.  They also covered "I (Almost) Got Away With It," commenting on the featured criminals’ personalities.  The discussion segued into criticisms of "Dance Moms," focusing on the show’s sexualization of young girls.  Concerns about predatory behavior at dance competitions and beauty pageants followed.  Jim Norton joined the show, recounting his recent Jay Leno appearance and audience reactions to his jokes, particularly those about overweight people. A caller, Bill, shared his experiences with security at dance competitions and the problem of secretly filming underage girls.  The show ended with further "Dance Moms" discussion and a mention of Otto’s upcoming show, "The Pig Roast."

The next segment began with an anecdote about a host's restaurant experience and a subsequent television appearance with Jonah Hill, Rove McManus, and Ross Matthews.  The conversation veered to graphic descriptions of a wax museum encounter, leading to a discussion of African-American fashion trends, specifically the "crisp" look.  The hosts then shared opinions on celebrity deaths, the offensive "F.U." listener segment, and their personal clothing and music preferences.  Mike Baker, a security consultant, joined, recounting his work tracking down Muammar Gaddafi's assets.  They discussed geopolitical situations in Libya, Syria, and the Israeli-Iranian conflict, touching on American military involvement, the mental health of soldiers, foreign policy complexities, media influence, and the upcoming US presidential election—all laced with offensive language and humor.

The following segment heavily featured political discourse, focusing on campaign finance reform and term limits.  The hosts criticized excessive campaign spending, citing examples like Michael Bloomberg's mayoral campaign and a high-priced Biden fundraiser (which one host attended). They discussed the perceived hypocrisy of both Democrats and Republicans on campaign finance.  The conversation expanded to a critique of modern American culture, expressing concern about a perceived decline in resilience and accountability among younger generations.  They linked this to readily available information and instant gratification provided by modern technology. This led to a tangent about slow airplane Wi-Fi.  A "How Much" segment absurdly calculated the amount of menstrual blood to fill a Chevy Trailblazer. Anthony Cumia shared a "True Confessions" segment about wearing women's silky underwear. Club Soda Kenny announced a benefit run for the Wounded Warrior Project.  The hosts discussed Jim Norton's upcoming stand-up show and Dan Saleo's firing for a racially insensitive remark.  They also speculated about the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and dedicated significant time to the upcoming *Three Stooges* movie, showing clips and focusing on the slapstick violence.

A later segment began with a discussion of a slapstick video clip, comparing it to "The View." This abruptly transitioned into a nostalgic look at "The Magic Garden," with internet searches for updated information on Carol and Paula, the hosts.  Sexually suggestive jokes about hiring them ensued.  The conversation shifted to the "Grease" soundtrack and movie, with further sexually explicit jokes.  The hosts then discussed "Zoom," using online searches to uncover information about its former cast members, again interspersing factual information with jokes and sexually suggestive remarks.  They mentioned celebrity encounters at Sirius XM, including Lady Gaga, Jennifer Lopez, Justin Bieber, and Scarlett Johansson, along with anecdotes about Nicole Ritchie and Kevin Costner.  They also touched on college basketball and presidential security.

Another segment started with vulgar descriptions of women's summer attire in New York City and comments about attractive interns.  One host detailed upcoming stand-up gigs.  They discussed the NCAA basketball tournament bracket and planned to have Rich Voss as a guest. Mike Baker reappeared, discussing his work schedule and fill-in hosting experiences.  The conversation then shifted to an unexpected studio interruption by Sam Roberts, Danny, and Travis, who interrupted E-Rock and Sam Roberts on air.  Their chemistry and E-Rock's past radio work were discussed.  This segued into Sam Roberts's use of Get Glue, his dislike of "Red Solo Cup," and a lengthy discussion about Sirius XM Hits 1’s music programming, focusing on the hosts' opinions on various artists and genre comparisons, especially country music.  A significant portion focused on a heated conversation between Sam Roberts and Paul, a phone screener, criticizing Paul’s lack of initiative and comparing him unfavorably to a productive intern.  The discussion became heated, with other staff members joining in.

The final segment discussed workplace dynamics and a coworker's (Sam) dismissive gestures instead of direct communication. The hosts argued for open communication on the show, emphasizing that it provided a platform for airing grievances.  The discussion was punctuated with profanity and concluded with a promotion of Ron and Fez's upcoming segment and the show's social media.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, this is Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM's Satellite Radio.  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  Forget it. The thing's out of control. Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hard. You know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mind?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to enjoy it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, you're good.  America's most trusted name in news, the Opie and Anthony radio show.  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Hi, come on, come on, everybody. 
[00:01:00]  There you are.  It's like an old music jock show.  I'm the only guy in the studio.  It's fantastic.  CBS FM.  CBS FM.  Hello, love.  Ron Lundy with you.  Hi.  Good morning, everybody. 
[00:01:30]  Opie and Anthony show.  Again, the vacationing Greg Opie Hughes is on some secluded island, sequestered on some secluded island.  He has time to tweet, though.  Notice that one.  Yeah, he does have time to, you know, put his vacation aside and get his tweets in.  Seems someone's a little, a little, feeling a little left out with the Kim Kardashian, Jon Hamm thing.  Yeah, yeah, you know, if you're on vacation and Kim Kardashian is tweeting some obnoxious, dumb shit, you know, you've got to respond, no matter where you are. 
[00:02:00]  And in this day and age, you have an outlet to do that.  You just get on, get on your phone and tweet from some remote location.  I remember in the ancient days, I used to have to uplink to a satellite on an old laptop and compress, take, upload uncompressed photographs up to a website that I put together, GeoCities website. 
[00:02:30]  And that was the only way to really get pictures from your paradise vacation up online for people to see.  Not that you thought people wanted to see them, but you just felt important that you could actually put pictures up that people could see.  I was an Angel Fire guy.  You were Angel Fire?  It was all about my Angel Fire website.  I had a GeoCities.  GeoCities.  Alta Vista!  Alta Vista.  My Wrestling Tape website was an Angel Fire website. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, where did all those places go?  Those are supposed to be like the big things.  Aren't they supposed to be the big things?  I don't know.  Who uses them?  I think you could still get into like a GeoCities website.  Like if you click on a link, it'll still work.  They started closing some of that shit down like a couple of years ago.  I don't know if it was GeoCities or something else.  I remember that like all those old school hosts, like I remember like they were going away.  Yeah, everybody had their own website.  But if you didn't get a lot of traffic to it, you'd put it all up on this stupid GeoCities site. 
[00:03:30]  The second you got traffic, they would close it down.  It's like, oh man, bandwidth exceeded.  Plus you'd figure out like it really wasn't that tough to do it on your own without a GeoCities or an Angel Fire or something.  That's what happened with AOL, I think.  I'm amazed people still use AOL.  You know, I was just reading something that said that 10% of the country still uses dial-up.  See, that's like people that was like, well, 98% of the country have color TV. 
[00:04:00]  It's like it's fucking 2012.  That should be 101% of everyone has a color television.  I think about it too, you know, like how many people are in this country?  Like over 200 million.  Yeah.  So that means that there's 2 million people, yeah, so like there's, there's, it was 10%, sorry.  So that's 20 million people that are dialing up using modems and shit?  That's a fuck ton of people.  Maybe it wasn't, you know what, maybe it wasn't 10%, maybe it was 5% or whatever.  But it doesn't matter.  It's still a huge number of people. 
[00:04:30]  If there's five people, it's too many fucking people.  And who was it?  It was BuzzFeed, right?  And you told me that they said like the BuzzFeed website on dial-up took like four minutes to load.  Oh, yeah, that was, yeah, the article.  Can you imagine that?  They dialed up and then tried going to different websites and said, and they tried going to CNN.  It took, it took CNN like a minute and a half to load.  But then it took with, completely with the ads, it took something like two and a half minutes to load.  It really is amazing.  I like when you download in a program or something and it says, uh, 56K modem, it will take you two hours. 
[00:05:00]  And it's like everybody else, it's three minutes to download the entire program.  Two hours on dial-up.  Enjoy your fucking dial-up.  Doesn't Bobo still have dial-up?  Yeah.  Oh, no way.  Does he?  I think he does.  That makes perfect sense.  Yeah, I thought so.  His connection should be as slow as he is.  Oh, I wouldn't be surprised.  If he couldn't use the phone because his mom had to go online.  Oh, right.  Oh, yeah.  You're like a detective.  Yeah.  He said he couldn't use, uh, she couldn't use the phone.  So Bobo, it was on the internet. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, yeah.  Bobo would pick up the phone in his room and just hear the internet and then kick his mom offline.  What are you doing?  I gotta use the phone.  She's probably still paying by the minute for AOL.  I'm not realizing.  For AOL by the minute.  Remember when you had to pay by the minute?  Yeah.  You talk to some people and they're like, well, I still like, yeah, I still like AOL because it gives me like, you know, the news.  And it's like my email and my, it's all right there.  It's all right there.  Yeah.  So is it everywhere else. 
[00:06:00]  We don't have to deal with AOL.  We don't have to go to like two sites.  I don't even know if it's the same as it used to be.  I doubt it.  When it used to, it used to update after every time you'd turn it off.  AOL is updating.  Yeah.  Ah, before you'd get the goodbye.  But don't worry.  You're not using any of your minutes.  Yeah, sure.  But your phone line is going to be tied up while we update for the next hour and a half.  I forgot all about that, that you used to, that you would have remaining hours for the month.  Yeah.  My, and they went unlimited after a certain amount of time, but I don't know if some people might. 
[00:06:30]  I'm sure everybody remembers what I'm talking about.  But there was a monthly fee and then you could pay, I think it was like five bucks an hour.  Not talking about your damn fee.  So my, my family, like we had a, we had like a $50 cap or some shit.  So after like the 10 hours that you, you got with the monthly thing anyway, we only had another 10 hours of internet for the, for the month.  So you had 20 hours a month.  A month.  Of internet.  To split between three people.  And my dad was bad.  Bad.  Yeah.  So. 
[00:07:00]  Porno?  Uh, yeah.  So, I mean, it was the, it was the first internet.  And it took forever to do anything anyway.  So it's our, so, you know, now time.  There were times where I was trying to, you know, kick game to some girls or whatever.  And then like, my dad would use all the internet up and it's just like, fuck, I can't fucking talk to these chicks for three weeks.  I used to go to the library.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  I used to, oh man, going into a chat room and then just hitting up like every chick in the room.  Go for quantity, right?  Well, you know, well, you have to put that many hooks in the water. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, yeah.  To get, you know, to get a bite, right?  But was it, was it?  I mean, do chat rooms in 1993.  What were you doing?  AFL.  But most of it was, most of it was dudes looking for fucking girls.  Oh, I got plenty.  Yeah.  Or people like Sam just like fucking with people.  He's told me so many stories of how many different AOL account names that he had and how he would just mess with people in chat rooms.  All the time, constantly.  Man, I was watching a fucking show, one of these other murder shows on, investigation, investigation, discovery, investigate. 
[00:08:00]  I was watching one of these shows on there, murder shows.  And here's the deal.  Some guy is online and there's some 17-year-old girl and she's fucking sending him pictures and shit.  And he's bullshitting that he's fucking in the Marines and he's a sniper.  And he sent pictures, but it wasn't him because he was 47 years old.  And he starts getting this relationship going with her and they get pretty fucking close. 
[00:08:30]  And it gets to the point where he says, will you marry me?  And she's like, yes, once you get back from your deployment in Iraq, because he said he was going to Iraq.  Sure.  And then he got ratted out.  He got ratted out because the guy's wife got online, saw his conversation, and told the chick like, hey, this guy's 47 years old.  She's like, fucking, you're disgusting.  You fucking, I'm never talking to you again.  And then the guy, the old guy's co-worker, who was younger, started talking to the chick, the 17-year-old, and getting all involved and going to see her and then spreading all kinds of shit around the place they worked because they were co-workers. 
[00:09:00]  That this guy, like, they were making fun of him and telling everybody at work, here's some fucking 47-year-old guy and he's trying to wheel out with this 17-year-old chick.  And the guy winds up killing the kid, the younger guy.  The older guy winds up killing the younger guy.  His co-worker?  Yeah, because he's so, you know, infatuated with this 17-year-old girl online. 
[00:09:30]  So then the cops go to talk to this 17-year-old chick, and they go to the house, and the girl's mother is there and start talking to the mother and telling her what happened.  The mother starts crying to the cop and goes, it was me.  Oh, my God.  It was me.  I was posing as my daughter.  So this guy winds up killing his co-worker, going to prison for life over nothing, because it wasn't even, it was some fat fucking old woman. 
[00:10:00]  And she's sending people pictures of her daughter.  Of her actual daughter.  Oh.  Yeah.  And fucking, you know, playing like she was the fucking daughter.  She should be killed.  Oh, yeah.  That's so much better than Catfish.  Yeah.  Way better than Catfish.  That was what Catfish should have fucking been.  Yeah.  A little murder and intrigue.  And something.  I love those.  But you know what?  That's why I like that channel and those kinds of shows, because you know what?  That shit's entertaining, man.  It's great.  I can't sit there past two.  Ronnie B was talking about two and a half men, saying he can't get past them.  Men, men, men.  Man, I'm the same fucking way. 
[00:10:30]  I'm the same way.  Like, I can never give that show a fair shot, because the second that shit comes on, I'm just  like, fuck that, and I turn the channel.  Done with it.  Shit like that on Investigate, dude, it's a thousand percent more entertaining than that shit.  It's all I fucking watch now.  A thousand percent.  It's the best stuff.  It's better than any show.  I don't know why people want to watch, like, CSI and stuff.  You get the real shit.  It's all real.  It's none of the bullshit.  And they show such great fucking murderous, horrid stories, and they're real people. 
[00:11:00]  It's great.  And now they're trying to fuck with you, because they used to just do the jailhouse interview  with the person, and they'd be in their jail clothes and talking about it, and you'd  go, and I guess they figured, like, oh, you know, people kind of know what's going on,  because they see he's in prison, so it takes the mystique out of it.  Well, they're slapping, like, dickies on these people with little ties and blurring up the  background and putting some colored lights on it so it looks like they might be in a  studio or home, you know, when they do those video shoots at the person's house and they 
[00:11:30]  light it all.  Where it looks like a fucking, I love the 90s or whatever.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.  It looks like that.  So they're doing that now to try to make you think, like, did he do it?  Is he in prison?  And they pan out and they realize the suit, shirt, and tie doesn't go below the chest.  Instead of his two armed fucking guards next to him, he's in shackles.  Orange pants.  Yeah, he's got the orange fucking prisoner pants.  But it's a smart thing to do.  That's how they should do it.  Yeah, it's a smart thing to do.  Because a lot of times the shows, some shows don't do that. 
[00:12:00]  And while you're watching it, you're like, okay, I know he fucking did it.  And you know he got caught and he's in jail now.  Yeah, but it's still cool to watch how he did it and shit, you know, and how he got caught.  Because some of these guys are like, fuck, there's no way he's getting caught.  I can't believe that mom was sending out pictures of her daughter.  Pictures of her daughter.  To creeps online.  And then the guy killed his co-worker.  Yeah.  You think he felt stupid?  Oh, did he feel dumb.  How much, how badly, how do you think he wanted to kill the woman when he found out? 
[00:12:30]  In what way do you think he would have killed her if he had the opportunity?  Oh, did he want her dead?  Because he's already going to jail for murder.  He already did a murder.  For murdering the guy because he was jealous of this 17-year-old that never even knew who the fuck he was.  Yeah.  Never gave him the time of day.  It was the mother.  Really, just a great twisty, turny story that was.  I wouldn't see that coming.  No, no.  Telling the story.  I didn't see it coming.  How many torturous jailhouse fantasies does that guy have?  Of just killing that woman in horrid, horrid fashion. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, it was a good one.  And the woman, she was getting re-involved with the older guy after she was involved with the younger guy online.  Because she realized, like, well, he's kind of my age.  And, you know, but without telling him.  So she probably thought, like, hey, one day I'll break it to him.  Yeah, yeah.  But he'll be so in love with me.  Yeah.  Because he loves the person that he's talking to. 
[00:13:30]  He loves my personality.  Right.  What a psycho.  And she probably was saying that to herself.  I mean, it is me talking to him.  Yeah, he'll accept it.  He'll be fine.  He'll accept that.  And they showed a picture of her.  And she's just this fat lump of shit.  And the daughter was just hot as fuck.  Did she get in trouble?  No.  They were trying to bring up some kind of charges on her.  But there was nothing.  Not even an AOL TOS violation.  TOS violation.  Yeah.  Did she get an email from the cat watch or whatever it was? 
[00:14:00]  Holy shit.  Yeah, she, I don't think there was anything really there that they could have gotten her on for being a fucking lying cunt online.  I don't know.  Half the country would be arrested.  What was the name of the show?  Do you remember?  Oh, man.  I watched so many of them.  They just whiz on by me.  Stupid guys.  It was last night?  Was it Devil You Know?  No.  Yeah, it was on last night.  Oh, no.  I'll never find it.  It was one of the broadcasts that are like they play them 20 times in one day.  I like that.  I like I Survived, which I just call The Race. 
[00:14:30]  Rape show.  Yeah.  Anytime a guy is on I Survive, it's something happened like he's stuck.  A bear is trying to eat him.  His shipwrecked or something like that.  Anytime a woman is on I Survive, she starts, she goes, hi, my name is Mary Smith and I Survive.  And you're just watching going, rapety rape, rape, rape.  She survived the rapety rape.  And it always, you know, it starts out maybe as a robbery.  Starts out as maybe a home invasion, maybe a carjacking. 
[00:15:00]  But you know that's not where the story ends.  No.  I was in the parking lot of the supermarket after shopping and I opened my car door and  next thing I knew there was a knife to my throat and a man was pushing, rape, rape, rape.  You survived the rape, rapety rape.  It's not a grocery robbery.  No, no.  Trying to get cabbage.  What did you do with the groceries?  Yeah, that's the rapety rape show.  And I've been getting into, I was saying yesterday, the 600-pound person.  But the crime ones are just, that's where the shit is. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  That's it.  Because you can't believe, it's just a different world from the world that you're used to living in.  Oh, man.  Like, how far deep do you have to go in before you realize, like, I'm fucked up.  Like, I'm one of those people now.  Yeah.  Like, I'm in this world there's no escape from.  I'm going to go to jail eventually.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  It just seems like a really harsh environment to be in.  I like the cops on there, though.  You know, I walked in and I saw her laying there and I have a daughter her age. 
[00:16:00]  Okay.  They always have to get the personal angle.  You know, I kept her picture hanging on my desk for 10 years.  Justifies why they took the guy out back and beat the shit out of her.  Yeah.  And then there's the, I like the cold case files, too.  Those are great stories because I call it, hey, knock it off, Budinsky.  It's always like a cold case file.  20 years goes by and then it's like, and then Detective Smith decided to take the cardboard box off the shelf. 
[00:16:30]  Just couldn't let it go.  Starts fucking getting in touch with old leads.  This guy's just welding in fucking Duluth.  You know, he hasn't done anything in 20 years.  Thank Christ, I fucking got away with murder.  Away with fucking murder.  This is great.  As Detective Smith pulls the box down and starts going through DNA evidence.  Oh, they didn't have DNA when I did this.  Fuck, I'm screwed.  Do you think if you kill someone and got away with it, you would always, in the back of your mind, be thinking, oh shit. 
[00:17:00]  Like, what if they catch me?  Every second.  Every day you wake up like, oh shit.  What if they catch me today?  What if somebody knows something?  What if they're looking for me right now?  Dude, it's one of those situations where you're like.  Man, I slept like a baby.  What do I got to do today?  Fuck, there's something I got to do.  Oh, I got to go get up to work. 
[00:17:30]  I'll work.  That's good.  Oh, the car.  Fuck, the car needs brakes.  I got a lot to do.  Busy day today.  Maybe I'll just get five more minutes.  Oh shit, I'm wanted for murder.  Fuck, I'm wanted for murder.  I killed somebody, murderer.  And that's 30 years.  Oh my God.  It was 30 years ago, but I know they're looking for me. 
[00:18:00]  I'm a murderer.  It was a hit and run, but I'm sure there was some pain.  I know, I left enough evidence.  Shit.  Ah, fuck, I'm going to be in prison.  I'm going to get raped.  I was listening to 1010 Winds driving in, and there was like a hit and run they were reporting.  And three people were hit by the car, but walked into the hospital and all survived.  Wow.  And you have to be listening to the radio like, oh no.  No.  No.  Someone's going to talk.  Someone's on something.  And they were like, police are not looking for a tan minivan. 
[00:18:30]  How many tan minivans are there?  Shit.  Yeah, there's my car.  Yeah, a tan minivan with fucking people dents in it.  Yeah.  A little face print.  Oh no.  All my friends know I have a tan minivan.  That's just got to fucking eat at you forever.  There have been some of those things.  There's that other show, I Almost Got Away With It.  That's a great one, where they go into jail, and they interview these people that have escaped justice for some length of time. 
[00:19:00]  And they tell them how they went about not getting caught up until they got caught.  But that show's really pretty fascinating.  And also a little twisted.  I don't mind when they talk to bank robbers, things like that.  People that have gotten away with thefts and the such.  But when they talk to the murderers, it's almost like they're kind of...  Giving you tips?  Yeah, giving you the tips.  Like, here's what I did wrong? 
[00:19:30]  And boasting about it.  It's like, yeah, I had a great 15 years out there.  You know, fucking sucking drinking.  And a lot of those guys, you could really see it in their face and hear it in their voice.  Like, they had a good time.  Had a great fucking time.  These murderers are sitting there going, I mean, yeah, I'm in jail now.  But I always try to look at the positive side of things.  I had 15 years of freedom.  It was great.  It was not always killing people and murders, but, like, you know, drugs.  Like, there was this one guy I saw.  He was on the run for, you know, just, you know, dealing drugs or whatever.  And you could just tell he was having the greatest time. 
[00:20:00]  I mean, he was looking over his shoulder.  But he was having a great time partying.  He had all this money.  Was that the guy with the plane?  Yes.  Yes, I think it was.  Yes, yes, yes.  And he was kind of just an older guy.  It was like kind of a 60s kind of guy.  He's like, yeah, I had a great time, you know.  He was, like, burying cash, right?  Yeah, yeah.  He was pouring, like...  Oh, it was fucked up how he was just storing the cash.  Dude, it was brilliant.  Yeah.  Like, he was putting it in, like, coolers and then putting, like, epoxy over the coolers.  Epoxy over that.  So that the, you know, rainwater and shit wouldn't get into it, into the earth, because he was 
[00:20:30]  burying this shit.  Very, I mean, he was burying money in his backyard, but it was fucking smooth.  He did it the right way.  And at some point, he was sitting there and he was like, I got away with this shit.  Yeah, for a long time.  I got away.  I got away.  Anyway, he fucking, he was living the high life, man, for a long time.  And you could tell, he's one of those guys where it was like, would you do it again?  And he would just go, yeah.  Yeah, I guess I would.  He's sitting there like, I am smarter than the police.  Those morons can't find me.  Oh, they never will.  It was like fucking Blow.  That reminded me of Blow, because he was just having a great fucking time. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, that was a good story, that guy.  Yeah, yeah.  I wish I could remember his name or the case.  Yeah, yeah.  How awful is that scene in Blow, though, where he's like, all right, one more mission.  One more.  I'm doing one more.  And then his friend's sitting at the table.  He's like, hey, buddy, what's up?  Yeah, and they're kind of looking at him like, hey, what's up?  Oh, shit.  And he goes, oh.  I was supposed to take my daughter to Disneyland.  Am I going to be able to leave?  Can I walk out that front door?  Like the Predator show. 
[00:21:30]  It's like, you're free to go.  Yeah.  And then the people that are onto it, well, I know what happens.  When I walk out the door.  But there is one.  Sometimes they think for a second, well, maybe I'm going to get out of this.  There's a lot of people on that show I remember watching when they'd be like, oh, okay, thanks.  Well, you're free to go.  Well, my life is going to go back to normal.  Oh, this is great.  Yeah.  And then right out that door.  Chris Hansen would be like, well, what do you think should happen to you now that you've done this? 
[00:22:00]  Well, I think, you know, I'll never do this again.  I promise.  I'll tell you one thing.  I'll go online a lot less.  I'm not even going to go online.  I'm going to throw my computer away.  But I think they're sitting there in their briefs with Chris Hansen in their underwear.  I think this has taught me a lesson.  And I think, you know, I should just have another chance because I won't do this.  Well, you're free to go.  I am?  Get on the fucking ground!  Get on the fucking ground! 
[00:22:30]  No!  Oh, no!  I'm a pedophile!  I love some of them awkwardly take, like, the alcohol that they brought with them.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, okay.  I'll just take my bag.  Yeah, I don't think the Zima's going to help you much in this case.  I guess I'll take the condoms and beer with me.  You know, for later, for a woman of age.  Yeah.  Hi, I made some sweet tea.  Sit down.  I'll be right back.  I'm going to get into my bathing suit.  Okay.  And that's the moment where they're thinking, this wasn't a scam. 
[00:23:00]  So you brought some alcohol, did you?  Ah!  Oh, shit!  And they're always like, hi.  Hi.  Hello.  Why don't you take a seat over there?  Oh, no, I'm done.  What an emotional rollercoaster.  He goes like, is this going to happen?  I'm going to fuck an underage chick.  Yeah.  Oh, no, I've been caught.  I can't believe I'm about to do this.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, no, I've been caught.  Oh, I'm free to go.  Oh, no, I'm getting arrested.  Oh, no, I'm getting arrested.  It runs the gamut, doesn't it?  Yeah.  It's amazing.  Even pulling up to the house, when she opens the door, hi, I'm in here. 
[00:23:30]  You got to be like, just panting like a fucking dog.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Then you open the door, it's like, yeah, I'm going to get into my bikini.  Oh, like, fuck.  Yeah, because the jacuzzi's nice and hot.  Ah!  Ah!  Why don't you take a seat?  Oh, no, fuck!  No!  No, I will not accept that Chris Hansen is in this room.  God damn.  Well, I mean, we can just talk for a second, right? 
[00:24:00]  She is getting in the bikini, right?  She's, uh, Chris, I don't have time for this.  You're going to have to leave.  That chick.  You're cock-blocking me.  That 14-year-old said she was getting in a bikini.  She's getting in the bikini.  There's no room for you in this fucking jacuzzi.  Yeah.  Would you like a Mike's Heart Lemonade?  Yeah.  You want?  I'll, you look, I'll give you a Mike's.  You can take a couple of cums, but you've got to find your own fucking underage chick.  Chris Hansen must be a pedophile, because this can't be the Dateline special.  Please, God, let Chris Hansen have been online with this girl, too.  Yeah.  I don't mind fluffy seconds, as long as I'm not on television about to get arrested. 
[00:24:30]  We're doing a story on...  No!  No, you're not!  Oh, just pull out your phone.  Well, I'm doing a story.  Yeah.  I'm doing a story.  On you!  On you doing a story!  Sir, there's no camera on that phone.  It's a little StarTac.  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  Are there cops outside?  I hope not. 
[00:25:00]  I like how they just take them right down, too.  Yeah.  And there's never a complaint that they were treated too roughly.  Like, obviously, I don't think anyone...  There might be one guy that had, like, a carload of weapons and rope and duct tape and shit.  But most of the guys are just these,  Hello!  Please die!  My wife, Jesus!  Or just, like, freeze!  Get on the ground!  And the guy turns around,  What do you mean?  Taser!  Taser!  Yeah, yeah.  They love fucking with these pedophiles.  Into that booking trailer with everyone else.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But they run up on him and just give him a cross-body block, 
[00:25:30]  knock him the fuck down.  Because these guys don't know what it's like to confront the cops,  especially cops that probably have daughters that age,  and they're like,  Yeah!  Really?  You like that?  Wham!  On the fucking ground,  knee in the neck.  And I love the numbers they started running, too.  Like, they literally were clearing pedophiles out of the backyard so they could bring another one through the front.  It's just amazing how fast they were driving up to these houses, the assembly line.  We got into a bit of a problem when two of them showed up at the same time. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  We double booked.  We double booked.  I don't know what happened.  Don't be late, because I have another appointment in 15 minutes.  That, uh, I guess they...  Get him out of here.  I guess they stopped doing that show because of that one guy that, uh...  What did he do?  He killed himself or something?  I think he killed himself.  That, and they got a lot of lawsuits for, like, entrapment.  Yeah, entrapment and shit.  And a lot of people got off.  Yeah, it was, uh, yeah.  Yeah, a few people got off the hook.  If they just seemed to have...  If they just shut their mouths...  A lot of people loved yapping to Chris Hansen. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  They'd sit there, and instead of saying, uh, look, uh, lawyer.  Lawyer, lawyer.  Lawyer, lawyer, lawyer.  Uh, they would be like, uh, yeah, I do this.  I do this a lot.  Well, I don't like to.  Uh, it's just, I, uh, I just...  I have to.  I have urges.  It's a sickness.  I know it is.  You, Chris.  But you're married.  I know.  Thank God it's just me and you talking, and no one's ever gonna see this.  It's the...  What are the cameras coming in the room? 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, these teamsters come out with cameras on their shoulders.  These fucking guys that all have the look that they just want to punch the guy's face in.  Because, again, they have daughters at home.  Yeah.  So it's just the five of us then, right?  You know what, uh, you should scope for online are the decoys.  Because they seem to...  The decoys that they use that are of age, but look like they're 14?  What's wrong with the decoy?  Yeah.  Hi, I'm a decoy!  Oh!  Oh, I'm fucking the fucking decoy from Predator Show! 
[00:27:30]  Nothing illegal about this, Chris!  This is great!  Hey, Chris, look, I'm fucking the decoy!  Suck it!  That'd be great.  Yeah.  Chris Hansen.  So he...  I guess he tried to parlay it into other things.  Yeah.  Dateline investigates, like, fucking the Nigerian scams, and it's like, this ain't sexy.  No one cares!  The one that I did, like, though, was...  He keeps trying to play Take On Me over and over again.  Yeah.  That was just his big head that's never coming back. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, not quite.  The one that I did, like, was to catch a lotto scammer or something.  Oh, come on.  Where they went into all the delis that sell lotto tickets, and they just showed people...  They showed, like, old women coming in and being like, did I win?  And the guy looked at the ticket, he'd be like, no, I'm sorry, you didn't.  And he'd put the ticket down on the counter, she'd leave, and then he'd go collect her lotto winnings.  But he had his pants on the whole time, so...  Yeah.  It's not as fun to watch, but people just assume, hey, this guy's going to be on the up and up. 
[00:28:30]  Hey, is this a big money winner?  Yeah.  Let me check.  Sorry.  No.  One number off.  What an asshole.  I mean, the person that brought the ticket.  That's why they got those new machines now.  Yeah.  Scan your tickets.  Scan them yourself.  But you're right.  It's nothing.  Like, you can't start with catching pedophiles on the internet.  No.  And then try to bust other people after that.  And then go to some other things.  Boy, the ratings really dropped off on that one.  Hanson had a great thing going for quite a while.  It was all he was known for.  But it doesn't even matter if most of the guys got off, like, off of the charges, because, 
[00:29:00]  like, are they ever going to be able to go on a date without, or get in it, like...  Oh, man.  Like, our intern, Jared, Cream Pie Jones, who said he can't get a job because people Google  him and find him playing with shit.  Right.  Like, can you imagine an employer Googling you and finding you had to catch a pedophile?  All right, Mr. Smith, we'll let you know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Listen, you're not going to...  You mind if we do a, uh...  We just going to do a...  We do it to everybody.  A little background check. 
[00:29:30]  No!  Oh, fuck.  By the way, there's a guy with my name and...  Look.  All right, look.  If I'm honest with you, is that going to give me any points?  Yeah.  What did you do?  You were on to catch a predator?  You, uh...  You were trying to have sex with a 14-year-old?  Was that wrong?  Should I not have done that?  Should I not have done that?  Because if I knew...  That's fucking hilarious.  The guy panics as if...  As if not...  As if not everybody does background checks. 
[00:30:00]  Like, we are going to do a background check.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, um...  Yeah, that background check thingy.  He probably just throws his hands up at that point.  All right.  Fuck you.  Look, I tried to fuck a 14-year-old, right?  Look, the charges were dismissed.  Yeah, and it was a long time ago.  And I thought she was 16, okay?  Yeah.  A long time ago.  Because that's the best part.  You could say the charges were dismissed, and normally if it was just a court case, they'd  have to take your word.  Okay, well, maybe there was a mistake.  You know, I had a lot of tickets.  Yeah.  I was like a scofflaw for my parking tickets, and I was picked up for it, but I paid them 
[00:30:30]  all off, and I got my license back.  All right.  You know what?  It's a warehouse job.  Sure.  Whatever.  But now they have video of Chris Hansen reading transcripts back to him, and him admitting,  yes, I did say that.  You said you'd like to lick her.  Yeah.  You asked her if she ever engaged in anal sex.  Oh, boy.  Here's the transcripts at your fucking employer's office.  Oh, he's reading them again to you? 
[00:31:00]  Okay, all right.  The job, I guess I don't get the job.  So do I get the gig?  Yeah.  I mean, it's all out in the open now.  Yeah, we all know.  We're all honest about it.  Oh, my God.  Well, I'm not going to lie to you.  That's the one thing I won't do is lie to you.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, look.  I'm honest.  If nothing else, I am honest.  Jimmy Norton, he will be in today.  Don't fret.  He was on Leno, I gather, last night.  Woulda, coulda, shoulda.  Woulda, coulda, shoulda. 
[00:31:30]  Jim Norton was on Leno.  I was watching, there's a little bit of controversy over the show I was watching last night, now  that we've talked about Chris Hansen and the pedophiles.  I was watching Dance Moms last night.  And it seems like, what's his name, that JonBenet's father says he regrets putting little JonBenet  Ramsey into those beauty pageants.  But from what I've seen from Toddlers and Tiaras, I have caught it occasionally, that 
[00:32:00]  they, it's never the fathers putting him in the fucking pageants.  No.  It's the mothers.  So it's that crazy JonBenet mom that's dead now.  Yeah, like living vicariously through this little girl.  Yeah, because the mothers are all fucking batshit crazy with these pageant girls.  Yeah.  And JonBenet's mother, I gather, was putting her in the pageants.  The fathers are either never seen or just pussy whipped into having to do whatever the 
[00:32:30]  mother says.  Well, she did pageants when she was a kid.  Oh, the mother did.  The mother, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it does seem like a disease that goes through a generation.  And then JonBenet, they say, she says, that JonBenet, you know, wanted to do it too.  But you know, kids, they're just, oh, I want to do that.  Yeah, yeah.  No, they don't.  Oh, look at the picture.  Yes, this is when your mommy was in pageants.  They forget about him in five minutes.  Yes, I want to be in pageants.  Okay.  Oh, great.  Oh, my dream has come true.  My girl wants to be in pageants. 
[00:33:00]  Because the minute it stops being fun and you actually have to work for it, a kid doesn't  want to do it.  And you know, her mom was just sitting there.  Now, remember, you said that you wanted to do this.  Now, because you said it's going to take a lot of work.  Now, I put work into this costume and you're going to get out there and shake your little  ass.  Okay, mommy.  I'll shake my little ass, mommy.  Good girl.  It's disrespectful to me.  I made the costume.  I made the arrangements.  Now, you are going to get out there.  This is costing us money. 
[00:33:30]  Now, snort these pixie sticks and get your fucking ass out there.  Okay, girl.  They're fucking baby speed that they give them, the pixie sticks.  But then I was watching Dance Moms.  And this is the show where some fucking fat pig of a woman runs a dance studio.  And these girls dance.  And there's the moms of the girls.  Are they the little kids?  Yeah, they're like 10, 11, 12, things like that. 
[00:34:00]  And these mothers of these kids make a drama with the dance teacher.  That's like, hey, my girl should be doing the solo this week.  Why?  My girl should be doing it.  I own this dance studio.  I own this dance studio.  And I say it.  What I say goes, missy.  Now, don't interrupt me.  And this is the excuse to parade young girls around in leotard and show them in provocative poses. 
[00:34:30]  That's the excuses, the drama.  They don't call it kids, scantily clad children dancing.  Right.  They call it Dance Moms because the show is all about the moms.  Right.  But you have to show the kids to reference the fact that they are mothers of these kids.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  Yeah, that's what it is.  So you've got to show what makes the moms proud, too.  Yeah.  Because they'll sit there and they'll flash for a split second to the mother's face and she's crying with pride. 
[00:35:00]  And then go back to the 12-year-old doing a fucking amazing split in underwear on the stage.  And what a controversial episode that came up.  And it actually did make the news.  The girls were doing an oldie-time burlesque fan dance.  You ever say these?  They take these big, giant fans made of feathers and you dance in provocative fashion.  And move the fans around, barely exposing little pieces of your body. 
[00:35:30]  And they were wearing flesh-colored bikini panties and little bras.  Like Britney Spears?  Yeah, yeah.  They looked fucking naked.  So these tiny little provocateurs.  Provocateurs.  Don't get it.  That, um...  And the moms are just sitting there proudly watching.  Oh, yeah.  That's little Maddie.  They're little 10-year-olds.  Maddie's very good.  She's one of the best dancers that they have.  And she's usually at the top of the pyramid. 
[00:36:00]  That is...  I have no idea.  All right.  By the way, I think it is also tough for you to criticize the motives of the show,  but you know all the girls by first name.  Look, I do a radio show and I have to know some of these girls' names.  Footage show.  Have you watched any episodes of the Niecy show yet?  No, I haven't seen Niecy! 
[00:36:30]  There's nothing I want to see on Niecy.  You know?  I could just go outside of the studio and walk around a little and see the Niecy fucking...  You'll catch the drift.  Leave it to Niecy.  Is that the show?  Leave it to Niecy?  Probably.  Yeah.  So the moms are sitting there and these little girls are becoming sexual objects.  Are there people who go to the dance office?  Like there's the weirdos who are just fans of the little girl beauty pageants.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  There's people that are in the seats.  Now, these competitions, the dance competitions, draw a few more people than these pageants do. 
[00:37:00]  Because the pageants look like there's 10 people on the seats and that's it.  These draw a few more people and there are some real creepy people with cameras and...  And they're just...  They don't have a horse in the race.  They're just there...  Just there to take pictures of the girls.  They're just spectators.  Doing their little dances.  And this dance studio for Dance Moms, this woman that's in charge, she loves dressing them  up in little provocative things. 
[00:37:30]  I was watching one last night and there was a bride thing.  So they're dressed up like brides, but they're wearing short little bride things and garters.  And they're moving around all fucking like sexy.  They're trying to be like sexy.  And just the whole idea is this virginal bride that you'll have sex with.  Right.  Because it's the wedding day.  And they invited the fathers down to watch the daughters dance in some kind of a bizarre  cuckold ding with your daughter moment.  To watch her shaking her ass in a bridal gown so other fucking degenerates can watch and 
[00:38:00]  drool over her.  Do any of the fathers have a problem with this?  No, they're all very proud.  You look so beautiful out there and I'm very proud of you.  And...  Oh, great.  As you saw the fucking...  Her leotard slip into her fucking lip slit.  Oh!  Look, I'm just being honest here.  It's what's happening out there.  You're just reporting on what you see.  That's what's happening.  They're doing fucking moves where they go on their back and hold their ass up and like 
[00:38:30]  pedal in the air with their feet.  And it's like, I'm fucking seeing like puffy vagina.  Everyone associated should be arrested.  The people who own the dance studio.  First of all, anybody who goes to this show and is just a fan should immediately...  It should be the same thing as to catch a predator.  I just like dance.  Wrap them up.  Yeah.  I'm a fan of dance.  Hazed on the way out of the auditorium.  As long as they're 11 years old.  There was a Sonny and Philly episode last season that dealt with that. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It was really fun about pedophiles going to just watch dancing.  Just to watch some dancing.  I'm a fan of just dance.  It doesn't matter who's doing it.  But, you know, I only go to 11-year-olds and 12-year-olds with dancing contests.  Yeah, so there was some controversy over that fan one where they were doing a little fan dance.  And then they had another one where the girls had guns in their hand.  They were doing kind of a James Bond-y kind of, you know, the opening sequence in James Bond. 
[00:39:30]  But a sexy version.  But it was a very sexy version, yes.  And some of the moms were kind of upset that there were guns in there.  Oh, they had no problem.  That's what they were upset about.  They didn't care that they were fucking, you know, half-naked doing it.  Travis, you have a daughter.  Yeah.  Could you ever?  I can't fathom how people do this.  Is Lisa going to be putting her in pageants?  No, she does ballet now, but she's two. 
[00:40:00]  There's the girls in the fan dance segment, which was the picture above that one.  It's just insane.  How would you feel if she had a ballet recital and there were just a couple guys there just to watch the recital?  Yeah, that's a little much.  I wouldn't feel good about that.  That's why we're going to get her into, like, golf or something.  Yeah.  Golf.  Something non-sexual.  Yes, something where, you know, you're outside.  While we load up that video.  Yeah, go to line 10, our buddy Otto.  Hey, Otto.  Otto.  Good morning. 
[00:40:30]  What's up there, Otto?  What are you guys talking about, television or something?  Yeah, television.  We're talking about that show with, you know, the pedophiles, the kids dancing, 12-year-olds, you know.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  What do you got going on, pig roast?  I, um, uh, yeah, my, uh, my, my, my last episode of The Pig Loss is airing tonight.  It was found in a Folgers coffee can.  We shot it in 1977.  Ah. 
[00:41:00]  I actually interviewed Elvis Presley right prior to his death.  Oh, retro.  I like that.  Yeah, it's pretty cool.  Is Charo a guest?  Charo?  I got Cher, I got John Travolta, and I got the one and only Elvis on there.  Yeah.  So, it's gonna, it's gonna be, it's gonna be a, a fun show.  And where, when?  I want, I want your sophisticated and also unsophisticated wonderful listeners to fucking watch it.  I work very fucking hard on this thing. 
[00:41:30]  All right, all right, Otto.  Where can they, uh, where can they get that?  Oh, the pig roast, uh, www.pigroast.tv.  Just two.  Yeah.  www.pigroast.tv.  HTTP, colon.  HTTP, colon, slash, slash, uh, pig roast.  Uh, all right, it's, it's the last, uh, last one, the, the final episode, uh, for now, of this season.  And also, I'm gonna be on that Davis Tell show that he's got now where he watches old porn. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, he watches old pornography.  What's the name of that show?  And chats about it.  He's gonna be on that show.  Old porno.  It's amazing what they'll put on TV.  It really is.  Uh, I, I, I think, uh, there's, everything else has been done so many times, it's time to just put smud on.  Yeah.  I like it.  I like it.  I actually went to a very gay Broadway play with Trish.  Trish and her parents took this.  Oh, you went to a Broadway play?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's called, it's called Memphis.  It's, uh, it's, I guess it's based on Alan Freed. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, man.  Yeah, he was, uh, he was, uh, gay, right?  Uh, was Alan Freed gay?  I, I, you know, he liked, uh, he liked, uh, they called it, uh, soul music, then.  They called it race music, actually.  Yes, race music.  Yeah, and he would, like, hijack stations and play this black stuff.  And he's the guy who coined the phrase rock and roll.  Yeah, yeah.  They made a whole musical out of his story.  Oh, they'll make a musical out of anything.  Was it any good, even though it was pretty gay?  Yeah, I fell asleep during the second act. 
[00:43:00]  There was just too many black people dancing.  Yeah, well, you gotta think Memphis.  That's gonna, you know.  I was, I was very impressed at how some of these fat black guys can really fucking dance.  Well, it all started with Rerun.  Remember Rerun.  He was, he could dance pretty good.  The first black guy to dance.  That was the first fat black guy that could really shake it.  You know, there's something really impressive when a very, like, hefty person can, like, you know, cut a rug.  Yeah, and it really is only black guys, fat black guys that could do that. 
[00:43:30]  Because white, fat guys, you know, they're dancing.  You just go, ah, look, that guy's an ass.  Right.  It's Jackie Gleason doing this fucking thing.  Yeah, yeah.  It's gonna be funny.  But you look at Rerun when he was dancing and doing all that fucking shit with his hands, hand jive.  And he'd be like, oh, man, that motherfucker can move, yo.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right, Otto, we gotta move along with this wonderful program today.  But the Pig Roast, pigroast.com, check it out, Otto.  And, of course, the lovely George and many guests. 
[00:44:00]  Thank you, Anthony, and your many guns.  Thank you, Otto.  Take it easy, man.  Okay, bye.  All right.  All right.  Well, as I was saying, dance moms.  You talk about TV?  Yeah, I talk about TV.  Sometimes I'm very impressed with your ability to remember what was going on.  Ah, yeah.  Because, like, if you had said to me, like, all right, what were we talking about?  I'd be like, um.  No, Otto had a plug.  I don't want to get a little plug-in for his pigroast there.  WW pigroast. 
[00:44:30]  I love that.  It's World War pigroast.  World War.  I remember WW pigroast.  God damn.  Yeah, we were in the trenches.  Lost a lot of good men.  Is TV a Roman numeral?  Yeah, TV.  WW pigroast TV.  Yeah, no dots.  No third W.  Maybe it's pigroastiv.  People will find it.  Yeah.  You know what?  This call might. 
[00:45:00]  Now, I don't take calls, but this call might be pertinent to the thing we were talking about.  Let me talk to Bill.  Are we going to do it?  Bill, let's go.  Hello, Bill.  Good morning, boys.  Hi, man.  Yeah, I used to work for a dance competition, and there were certain cities where it was 100% we were going to have to watch for guys showing up that would sit either, A, sit in the crowd shooting.  But one of their things was they'd like to stand by the doors to the backstage changing areas. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, man.  Trying to shoot video into the dressing room.  When the door swings open, they would, like, just point their camera and try to shoot into the girls' dressing room.  And you were doing security, so your job was just to look out for fucking pedos?  It was insane, because parents would be complaining.  Well, they're videotaping.  It's like, okay, we can't do that.  Then a couple times, I'll give you an example, Minneapolis?  Yeah.  That's a bad city, man.  Minneapolis, a lot of pedophiles? 
[00:46:00]  Three times on a weekend, you have three different chances the cops would have to be called as you'd be chasing guys out of the building for videotaping into the girls' dressing room.  And we're talking, like you said, the Rangers would be from, what, like, 5 to 8 up to, like, 18, and they'd be videoing.  Wow.  What a bunch of creeps.  Oh, and speaking of creeps, that was a Laverne and Shirley moment, wasn't it?  What a bunch of creeps.  Hello.  Jim Norton is in studio, fresh off of his airplane, I would gather.  Yeah, yeah.  A little late. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, there he goes.  Look at that.  I like doing it like that, too.  You just chop them off.  That's the Ronnie B way to take a call.  Well, you just, he gets the question out, boom, hang up on him.  Yeah, click answer.  That's how I got bamboozled by Man Cow, by the way.  That's exactly how I got bamboozled.  I don't think that's how it happened.  Because I thought I was going to be on the line for longer than I was, so I gave the good part of the phone call.  If you remember, I had a, you know, I was going to prank Man Cow, and what happened was I started by doing a real call, and then I was going to slam him. 
[00:47:00]  I believe that you got on the phone with him and realized this is a compelling radio host.  I enjoy this program and would like the answer to this question.  I swear I was going to hang him out to dry, but then I heard that click because he does it like Ronnie B, where once you get the point out, the caller goes away instead of staying on the line to interrupt every fucking two words that we're talking about.  You said fucking everything but first time, long time.  I think I had to say love the show, right?  Love you, love the show. 
[00:47:30]  Love you, love the show.  It's one of my favorite things that's ever happened on the show.  Oh, it's fantastical.  That was really do shit.  Jimmy.  Jimmy Norton, how was your trip to Los Angeles?  It was okay.  They were a little groany, the crowd, but it was okay.  Groany?  A little groany, yeah.  Oh, no.  They were like, uh, they didn't like some of the material?  A couple of the jokes I didn't care for.  Were they a little over the top?  What did they entail?  I think one they actually cut was, uh, one of the top was, was that they were doing the,  they didn't show the one where they were talking about the police, the state police seal? 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  Did they show that or nobody knows that?  I don't know.  I was watching Dance Moms when it was on.  Sorry.  Sorry, you were trumped by fucking 11-year-olds in bikinis.  Understandable.  There'd be something wrong if I wasn't.  And I think they just, they cut one of the jokes.  It was a little bit mean.  It was mean-spirited?  Yeah.  To who?  Fat people.  Oh.  Well, we should be mean to fat people.  The, the, the thing was, the punchline was, if, if the guy's so good at drawing pigs, 
[00:48:30]  he should do the poster for, uh, uh, The Biggest Loser.  Oh.  And the crowd was like, oh, they fucked up.  Oh, fuck you.  I was so annoyed.  Oh, God.  Was that the one where the, uh, prisoners were making the labels for the, the tags for  the cop cars.  Exactly.  Yeah, right, yeah.  And actually, uh, kind of delicately placed a pig in the, in the logo for their-  It was in the cows.  Like, you know, the cows got the spots in the side.  It was in that, so you had to really look to see it. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, but some of the trooper caught it.  Yeah, it was a pig.  It was like Hidden Mickeys at Disney World.  Yeah, yeah, Hidden Mickeys.  But if you have a prisoner fucking painting your shit, of course-  What do you expect?  You know, you're a cop and a prisoner's fucking doing it, he's gonna put some, something wacky  on there.  Uh, but yeah, so they didn't like the pig joke.  They groaned, yeah, the pig.  How fat people have any fucking, like, like, lobby, how do they have a fucking interest group  that looks after their, their best interests?  I don't know.  As far as jokes go.  Why are people groaning at fat people jokes? 
[00:49:30]  It was really annoying that they did that.  Ah.  But, uh, I don't wanna watch it.  I can't, I can't watch anything I'm a part of.  Nah.  Same reason most people, other people don't.  Sickening and disappointing.  Mediocre.  Do you get to do anything out there, or do you just do the, the show?  I went to a business dinner on, uh, Monday night.  A business dinner?  Yeah.  It was show business dinner.  I know, right?  It was a little show busy of me.  Look at you.  And, uh.  We got Sardi's?  No.  Where were you?  We were at a sushi restaurant, and I saw, uh, Charlize Theron. 
[00:50:00]  She looks good in person, man.  Oh, she looks good anywhere.  Did you ask her for a picture?  No.  I've heard she's not approachable.  Wow, really?  She seemed very, you know who else was there?  The guy from the Chili Peppers?  Anthony Kiedis?  There's always celebrities in this place, and I've never asked him.  That's where I saw DiCaprio.  I've never asked anybody in this place.  Just because it's like, I know, I like the people who work, who own it.  Yeah.  And the food is great, and it's like.  Don't want to be one of those people.  Yeah, nobody fucks with these people in this place.  Huh.  She looked really good, too.  I thought she was older for some reason, man.  Yeah.  I don't know why I thought she was, like, in her 40s. 
[00:50:30]  Was there anybody on the show that you got a picture with?  No, Jonah Hill was the lead guest.  Did I talk to him?  No.  No?  No.  I just did my segment and left because I don't stick around for promotion at the end  when there's three of us.  It was me, Rove, and Ross Matthews.  If I'm doing a segment with Jay, I'll stay for promotion at the end.  Right.  Like, I'll be in that thing.  But if it's just the three of us, we don't stay for promotion.  My shirt looks really wrinkled there.  Does it?  Yeah.  Oh, you look adorable.  Nah, the sleeves are actually short.  I'm such a shrimp that I took the, uh, I went to the tailor and had the sleeves shortened. 
[00:51:00]  Did you go to the tinker, the tailor, the soldier, or the hat?  Oh, the tinker, the hat, the soldier, the spy.  There's so many of them.  Who knows who's what and what's who.  So you did that.  How was Jon Barenthal, man?  I'm fucking crying.  I missed him.  Oh, my God.  He was great.  He was.  He was really good.  Yeah.  Did you watch the episode?  No, I got to see it.  Oh, my God.  But, uh, I don't listen to the interview. 
[00:51:30]  Why?  Well, because we talk about a spoiler.  Oh, E-Rock got the shot.  Thanks for the pictures.  That was funny.  Grabbed the cock in my fucking mannequin pictures.  I can't believe you still haven't seen it.  I thought you downloaded it on my head.  Come on.  You saw it.  I saw it.  Yeah, I was just looking.  I can't believe they fucking killed him.  Isn't that amazing?  I can't believe they killed him.  Oh, Danny did it, too.  Everyone's great.  I think that's the hack thing to do.  Like, of course, you don't touch the dick of it.  Dude, I went to the Wax Museum years ago, and I have 30 photos of me touching everyone's 
[00:52:00]  cock in the Wax Museum, except for Helen Keller.  I'm touching her face.  Did you have wax on your ass, too?  Just backing into the little statuettes.  No, but I met this girl in Buffalo on the computer, and we were talking dirty, and I'm like, I'll  fly you in tomorrow morning.  Wow.  I just, it was like, I think we were, we might have been off the air when this happened.  Might have been 2004.  Or three.  And I was like, I wanted to fuck her.  And I'm like, I'll fly you in. 
[00:52:30]  And then she came in, and she was nice, but there was just no chemistry.  Oh, boy.  She was, like, lumpy.  And, uh...  Like, literally lumpy?  Nah, she was just like, meh.  And, uh, I didn't know what to do, but I was on no sleep.  So I just said, fuck it.  We went to the Wax Museum.  We didn't fuck.  Wow, really?  And I just touched every, I touched every, every penis.  Every fucking, every...  I might even have some of the pictures with me.  There's a lot of them.  Oh, shit.  Got some good ones.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's wonderful.  Ozzy and Sharon.  That's what you do.  Get Ozzy's penis. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  I went to that Madame Tussauds over there a while back, and I don't know why you just do feel  compelled to do dumb things.  Because I, I, I had Christopher Reeve in a headlock, and he was in the, it was the wheelchair  one, too.  Yeah.  It was him in a wheelchair.  I had him in a headlock, and I was giving him a noogie.  Because noogies are hilarious when you're in a...  When it's the only part of a person they can feel.  When every, when every piece of love and touch and human interaction comes through the 
[00:53:30]  top of their dome, it's hilarious.  It's the only thing he feels is a noogie.  Believe me, it's his way of hugging.  And he probably had to rub his head on people.  It's terrible.  Or you are putting your dirty knuckles in his head.  Oh, shit.  Oh.  Yeah, we've, we've, we've missed Chip, of course.  Of course you have.  But everybody's been, you know, doing imitations of Chip, but it never quite is Chip.  I hate Sam's Rocky hat.  Why?  It's just, it looks stupid.  CR.  What is it? 
[00:54:00]  It's a hat.  What do you mean, what is it?  Creep Roberts.  Yeah.  There's no reason for that.  What, uh, what is the...  Rockies.  Colorado Rockies.  You know the Rockies fan?  That's the Rockies fan.  I mean, it's my team this season.  It's like you and your baseball cap.  Would you just pick a team?  I'd pick purple and black.  Why?  Because they're, like, the brothers like that color.  No, no, no.  I like purple and black.  Homies love purple and black.  Do they?  I don't know.  Yes.  Yes.  Because it's fashionable.  You just were drawn to it somehow.  Maybe genetically.  Maybe you were drawn to that color, weren't you? 
[00:54:30]  You had a genetic predisposition to enjoy those colors.  I looked at the brim and got thirsty.  Yeah.  Well, you did.  It is the same color of drink.  Yeah.  You did kind of curl the brim a little bit, though.  Yeah, it's not a straight brim.  I didn't leave the stickers on.  That's a straight brim thing.  Why did black guys eat the stickers on?  Because one person decided that, you know, you should leave the sticker on.  It's about looking crisp.  And everything has to look new.  Like, the shirts have to come out.  Like, if you get an undershirt, it has to be right out of the plastic. 
[00:55:00]  Like, once you wash an undershirt, it's not even worth wearing anymore.  Freshly shoplifted.  Wait, so they like to see the fall marks in an undershirt?  Yes.  If you have fall marks in your shirt, you're fucking like, oh, shit.  Who fucking makes this shit off?  Itches.  I would never.  I would tell the brothers, look, gang, my skin is very itchy.  I can't do the new shirt business.  At least two washes with softener, of course.  All the tags have to stay on.  Yeah, the tags are on, the stickers are on.  Like that.  Eventually, someone's going to decide that it's cool to leave that little sticker on your jeans 
[00:55:30]  where it says, you know, 32 by 32.  Yeah, the size, finally, I will be cool.  32, 32, 32, 32, 32.  How many times?  When you just leave it on, that's what I've said.  I've done it.  We were doing Lucky Louie, me and Louie, we were going through a rehearsal, and the  woman who was playing, like, the counter girl had that 32, 32, 32 sticker on, and Louie  said to me, he's like, don't tell her it's on.  He goes, all I want is for them to film her, for her not to know that's on.  It was his show.  He wanted her to have that on. 
[00:56:00]  Somebody told her he was so annoyed.  Don't tell her.  It beats the shit out of pins, though.  I'm not a big fan of the pins in the dress shirt.  That just seems fucking, like, really a dangerous thing that just has been there for as long  as I can remember, so they just keep doing it without any warning.  There should be a warning.  Hey, there's fucking pins in here.  There's a dozen pins in your shirt.  That's some pretty early trolling.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm going to put some pins in your shirt problem.  Yeah, but so the crisp look is it. 
[00:56:30]  So that's why you don't fold the brim of the hat.  You leave the tags on.  Everything should look like it just came from the store.  You do realize this has to come down to one guy that originally did it.  That's how everything is.  Patient zero or whatever it fucking is.  Like, there isn't a committee of black what's hip stuff that kind of gets together and has  a little meeting and tests stuff in the community and then sends it out there. 
[00:57:00]  A focus group.  A focus group.  Yeah, yeah.  No, so one black guy, whether it's, you know.  How does it catch on?  It's got to be at the top of the pyramid.  It's got to be like a Jay-Z or Kanye West or Lil Wayne.  So who started the crisp look?  I don't know who started the.  See, that's just it.  You don't know.  Lil Wayne, I would credit for popularizing skinny jeans with black people.  Really?  Because that's starting to pick up.  But that's like a hipster thing.  Right.  Now it's like.  Yeah, Lil Wayne is adopting. 
[00:57:30]  Lil Wayne?  The rock look.  Yeah.  But by the time Jay-Z is done with a style and it hits the mainstream, I mean, he's done.  He's done.  The entire black community is done with it.  I can't wait until Lil Wayne starts fucking wearing like Sabbath stuff.  Black people have to run out and buy fucking Aussie and Sabbath things.  And you'd look cool, like every day.  Like, hey, look at this hip guy.  Yeah.  Wow, this guy is really the bee's knees, they'd probably say.  I just don't know how it catches on.  Yeah, but you couldn't wear your.  You'd have to get new Sabbath shirts.  Every day. 
[00:58:00]  Like yours look like you've worn them for a while.  What do they do with the shit that like isn't crisp?  Like do they just wear shit one day and throw it out?  Yeah.  Or they iron it a certain way.  Or they don't wash it so they can wear it again.  Well, that's not good.  Like they'll wear an undershirt.  And then they won't wash it.  Gotta reek.  Well, they won't wear it like more than a couple times.  But you'll wear an undershirt and then you'll put on a crisp t-shirt.  Like you remember when Patrice used to come in here in that pink Panther shirt?  Yeah.  Like you don't wash that shirt.  No.  You can't. 
[00:58:30]  But I do understand people that are making some money can do this.  But if you've got like, it's given a message to the community that like,  you're not going to be able to sustain that kind of fucking wardrobe.  They spend all your money on undershirts.  Yeah, yeah.  And then throw it away.  That's why you can go into the hood and see nice cars parked in front of dilapidated houses.  You're saying they're not being responsible with their money?  Not always.  Not every single person in the hood.  No.  I wonder what trends don't catch on.  Yeah.  What's the ones that like, oh shit, man.  This should have flown.  Probably socks on the outside of the jeans so your bike doesn't. 
[00:59:00]  Like there's probably somebody who pulled their socks way up on the outside.  Leg warmer shoulder pads.  Never caught on.  Leg warmer shoulder pads.  Purple condoms with dick sticking through the fucking pants hole.  It's probably a dud.  How about cutting the top off of a hat so it's like a visor and then wearing it around your neck like a fucking...  Like a beekeeper?  Like a necklace thing.  Oh.  Yeah, yeah.  Just like a hat so the brim is across your chest.  Now why the fuck wouldn't that catch on?  If you could get the right person to do it... 
[00:59:30]  To wear that?  And then the right person under him does it.  Like if you got Jay-Z to do it and then you caught Lil Wayne doing it or something...  Then it would be you.  Then you're such.  Or how about this?  If someone had like...  They did like some...  Someone had a brand new t-shirt at their house and somebody had just taken a shit and  then they came out and they didn't see the t-shirt and they sat on it and they got like an  asshole print on it and then you'd have to be like, yo, I got a doo-doo stain.  I got a doo-doo stain.  Like, because he wouldn't know it was it until you were walking around and then people would 
[01:00:00]  be like, yo, he got a doo-doo stain.  Yeah.  And then a whole line of clothing.  Doo-doo stain clothing.  Yeah.  It was shot on our DDS.  Yeah.  Yo, where's your DDS's, man?  You ain't got no doo-doo stain.  I got my DDS on.  Whoever started it could copyright it and make a DDS clothing line.  Yeah.  DDS clothing line with like doo-doo stains.  Not real ones even.  No.  Just ones that are like fake on pants and stuff.  And after that, you couldn't have a real doo-doo stain on your clothes.  It would have to be one of the fake ones.  It would have to be the fake DDS from the DDS clothing line.  You'd have to smell it. 
[01:00:30]  Yo, let me see that smell check.  They give you the smell check if it was a real doo-doo stain.  Smell your shit.  Let me smell your shit.  You couldn't afford the real designer doo-doo stain.  Doo-doo stain.  Like a little asshole print with little creases of an asshole.  Like a puckered asshole.  Like a girl put a kiss with lipstick on something.  I'm starting doo-doo stain clothing.  DDS, yo.  Yeah, doo-doo stain tuxedos.  See, why can't that take off?  It's great.  If you get the right guy to wear it, it's there. 
[01:01:00]  Now, is this a look?  Just wearing fucking headphones?  Just walking around wearing headphones?  You're not listening to anything.  Yeah, because Dr. Dre's headphones are very cool.  So even if you're not listening to anything, just as a fashion statement, you could just wear those.  Yeah.  People just wear them?  You could.  I see so many Beats by Dre headphones.  That's it.  And those are some expensive headphones.  Are they better than Bose?  Yeah.  Well, no, I think Bose is like.  They're cooler to have.  They're cooler, though.  Bose, what are you, white?  When you see that red string.  Yeah.  That's a status symbol, right? 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  There's a lot of fake ones, too.  There's a lot of knockoffs.  Because I'll see on Amazon, it'll be like, you know, like $150.  And then it'll say, buy new, $39.  Right.  And there's just a bunch of knockoffs.  How much is Dre's?  Like a buck fifty.  Oh, that's some Bose about that.  $150.  Yeah.  I love a pair.  Yeah, and they're completely an accessory now.  Like, people, you could just wear them around your neck.  But they're also very good.  They're good headphones.  Are they getting them pulled off their heads in the subway?  Is that happening?  Oh, yeah.  People jacking.  Yeah, they're jacking their shit.  Jacking Beats all the time.  Yeah, I want a pair, but now I'm scared, like, you know.  They'll get jacked.  Yeah, because I don't ride a good subway. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, you look like a Mark.  They wouldn't take mine.  I'm clapping my hands.  These are Beats by Dre.  Beats by Dre.  Beats by Dre.  You betcha.  You betcha.  I have the little in-ear Beats.  That's what I want.  Which are Diddy Beats.  Diddy Beats?  Special edition Diddy Beats.  Oh, crap.  They just put their name on the shit.  Yeah.  I got B-O-Z.  B-O-Z?  Yeah.  What are those?  Bose.  Oh.  B-O-Z.  I would just say that those are Peats.  These are Peats.  These are not. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, please don't take these from me.  Yeah, these are Peats.  They're not Dre Beats.  That's not a B.  It's a P.  But that's what happens.  Like, Dre puts out Beats, and they're ridiculously successful.  And now Jay-Z's got his own headphones out.  50 Cent's coming out with headphones.  Everybody comes out with, you know.  Yeah.  Everybody.  But it's not your name.  Everybody.  Because he's had these for years, and they're catching on now because they're good headphones.  Right.  So, yeah, you can't just be like, hey, here's my headphones.  Jim Norton headphones.  Are coming out. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, man.  They have big, big holes where the earpiece is going.  You can just hear life.  You can just hear.  You just hear life.  So, there's nothing coming through them, really.  It's just holes are cut in them.  It's a big thing of headphones, a big, fat one, with a giant hole, so air comes through, and you get life.  It's got to be battery power, though, so you get a shock whenever you touch anything.  Yeah, there's batteries all through the top.  It's seven D-cell batteries, like the top of the St. Louis arches, and they're like, what are you doing? 
[01:03:30]  I'm hearing some life.  I see that being a big cellar.  Yeah.  Big cellar.  And that was what the fucking, the thing would look like that connects, like the little string would be like an old school fucking curly phone cord.  Like an old school curly phone cord.  Old school, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's right.  Five inches long only.  Oh, like those.  But thicker, longer.  Fucking always tangling.  I like how they used to put the real extended line on the phone, because they thought, well, now you can go from room to room with your kitchen phone. 
[01:04:00]  And the thing just ended up like a tumor hanging on the end of the fucking...  How many times you do this?  Oh, yeah, yeah, trying to...  The wave move to try to untangle it to go around the corner.  Untangle it.  I got to get a little further.  I would just hold it.  And let it unspin itself.  Yeah, yeah.  And there was always one kink in it that you couldn't figure out how to get out.  I don't know.  Yeah, you have to go back to the beginning.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:04:30]  Ancient times.  Ancient times.  Now we have our cell phone communication devices.  Jimmy, did you get your food?  I did.  Food!  Food!  All right!  Why don't we take a breakie and eat?  Break time, boss?  And then we'll get back to a...  Shake it off, boss!  Good morning, good morning.  I got a double dose this morning.  Did you?  I got a welcome aboard.  Welcome aboard.  I think someone's telling him because he's really...  Nice.  He is giving me welcome aboard and good morning with such gusto. 
[01:05:00]  No, he gave me that one today, too.  Yeah?  Yeah, good morning, good morning.  You're not taking into account that he's a moron.  Yeah.  Welcome aboard.  Welcome aboard.  Good morning.  Good morning.  How come your hat's not crisp enough?  I don't like...  I don't want to...  I like a crispy hat.  I know.  I change it up a little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  I take it, and then I change it a little bit.  You look like you're trying.  Trying what?  That's exactly...  It looks like you're trying to...  To be a queer.  It's working. 
[01:05:30]  Success.  Yeah, home running.  At least they're successful.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we'll take a break, and then we'll be back after these words.  The Opie and Anthony Channel.

[01:08:30]  I'm wearing my Cure makeup.  Yeah.  Well, you look pretty unique in that with your, we're just talking about your suit.  Yeah.  I was, uh, I was just wondering if you ever dress casual.  I do.  I do.  But, but, you know, there's days when you've got a, you've got to show up in a suit because  that's what they expect.  The suit is more important than the man showing up.  Absolutely.  Just the suit.  Yeah.  All your ideas, you know, all your capabilities.  As long as you're wearing the right clothes, you know, you, you, you're displaying, uh,  respectability and capability.  I need a stylist, Mike. 
[01:09:00]  You're right.  Oh, boy.  I really do.  I got to get a stylist.  I'm shooting something in April.  I don't know what to wear.  Hopefully yourself.  That old gag.  I'd wear a suit if you're going to shoot yourself.  No suit, though.  I'm going to put on my dress blues, like in, uh, A Few Good Men.  Fucking J.T. Walsh fucking blows his brains out.  All right.  I thought it was in that one.  Yes.  Nobody does a t-shirt like you, though, Jimmy.  That's right.  I'm eating a banana.  Jimmy's eating a banana.  Uh, how are you doing with your, uh, Weight Watchers points? 
[01:09:30]  Pretty good.  I just ruined the conversation Mike and Anthony were having off Mike.  It's a guy with a new thing who just ruins.  It's like, hey, uh, points.  Hey, look, I know you guys are talking about the game, but my Weight Watchers points have  really been doing well.  Speaking of points.  Oh, fucking boo, Jim.  You're like a pig on the plane.  He came in and he sits down and he goes, uh, I had a bag of nuts on the plane.  You know how many points that is?  Yeah, and he knows now.  No, he's only a little cup of nuts.  Not half a cup.  It's a little teeny one.  You're saying bag, like they give you a bag in first class. 
[01:10:00]  No, they give you.  I wasn't in first class.  Oh, yes, you are.  Um, yeah, but I'm fucking an Asian noodle salad.  That's a much.  4,000 points.  I can't eat for six years.  What?  Macadamia nuts?  Or are they, uh, what are they doing first class now?  Well, mixed nuts.  Um, warm mixed nuts.  And they're warm.  It's wonderful.  Oh, they're wonderful.  I was awake.  It's a big sleeper seat.  And I was awake the whole fucking plane ride. 
[01:10:30]  Why can't you sleep on an airplane?  I don't know.  You're terrible.  Those, what a waste of a big sleeper seat.  I know.  There's some fucking guy in coach with his neck twisted, uh, trying to catch some Z's and  he's actually sleeping.  And you got that big sleeper seat.  I didn't open my comforter and pillow until fucking three hours into the flight.  Are you afraid you're going to miss something?  I mean, like, everybody else is getting a rub down if you fall asleep.  No, I just can't.  I get itchy.  It's too warm on the American planes.  Because you don't have the little cooler thing over your... 
[01:11:00]  Open a window.  I mean, can't do that.  On the American planes.  As opposed to the Ford.  Oh, American Airlines.  I thought he wanted to fly Aeroflot.  Yeah.  I don't sleep for shit.  It's really frustrating, man.  I admire guys like you who can just fucking sleep.  Oh, man.  I love it.  Not just because you're sleeping, which is great, but the time travel aspect is amazing.  I got a flight of Seoul on Friday.  That's like a 15-hour flight.  Oh, wow.  Why?  Yeah.  From Seoul, I'm going to Mongolia.  Wow.  Yeah.  You don't hear that sentence every day. 
[01:11:30]  Second honeymoon?  Yeah.  I'm going to pick up my second wife.  Well, I guess somebody is going to be eliminated in Mongolia.  What?  No?  Really?  It's time to go.  Yeah.  I got to leave.  You run a security firm, right?  So they say.  Yeah.  Diligence.  For all your information and security needs, that's diligence.  Yeah.  It's an intel and risk management firm.  So you go to Mongolia, and there's somebody there that feels that they need some more security 
[01:12:00]  than they have.  Or intelligence, yeah.  Or intelligence.  Yeah.  No, you know what?  We do it.  It's a whole variety of things.  You go to EROX room.  Give them some intelligence.  See?  It's a stupid kid.  That was a stupid joke, not a fat one.  Fat ones will come.  Do you do any stuff domestically, like find stuff out about people?  Yeah, we do.  Yeah, we work.  We do probably about 40% of what we do around the world is here in the States.  The rest of it's all over the map.  Is it private investigating? 
[01:12:30]  You know, I mean, that's what people think of it as.  But it's competitive intelligence.  So, you know, a U.S. company wants to know what, you know, their foreign competitors are  up to, or, you know, we're chasing assets.  You know, so, you know, as an example, Gaddafi, you know, scrolls away $200 billion in the course  of his 40 years in office.  And now the new government would like to know where it is.  Wow.  Okay, so that is some cloak and dagger kind of stuff where you're poking around.  Oh, it's both cloak and dagger.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How do you find Gaddafi's money?  It's in Gaddafi's wallet. 
[01:13:00]  Oh.  Silly goose.  It's a big wallet.  Yeah, a big passbook savings.  Passbook, he gets it stamped.  It has fucking bloody fingerprints in it.  But that's really complicated.  I read Red Fox's book, and they were saying his finances are still, to this day, he died  in 91, they're still untangling his finances.  And if Red Fox fucking left, you know, Gaddafi is a problem.  It was a step ahead.  But these guys, I mean, whether you're talking about Gaddafi or anybody else in that book, 
[01:13:30]  you know, they start stealing government money over the period of time as the despot.  And, you know, they set up thousands and thousands of these, you know, single-purpose companies  all over the world.  Cyprus, Liechtenstein, you know, the Cayman Islands, Channel Islands, all over the map.  And they just start stuffing little pots of money all over the place for a rainy day,  you know, at that point where, you know, maybe they've got a hot-footed out of town  or whatever you call it.  And, you know, your job is to start pulling on the threads trying to figure out where that, 
[01:14:00]  you know, trail's going to lead you.  And it can be extremely difficult.  Why didn't he leave, by the way?  I didn't interrupt you, but why didn't he leave to go to one of those little places  when it looked like it was going really bad?  No, he had the opportunity, but, you know, he just, well, A, he was psychotic.  And, B, he honestly thought that it was just going to blow over.  Yeah, yeah.  Boy, if you couldn't tell that that was the shit hitting the fan and it's time to fucking leave.  Boy, you really are a poor judge of shit hitting fans.  Could he have gotten out and gotten sanctuary somewhere? 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, there would have been an opportunity.  There were a couple of offers to him just, you know, because he'd get the hell out  and stop the loss of life, you know, get the thing back on track.  Yeah.  Not because anybody loved him at that point, but you've got to remember, I mean, not to get lost  in the weeds, but Gaddafi from 2003 was our guy, right?  I mean, he kind of turned himself around, so to speak.  Right.  He was working with us, and it was a bizarre, you know, setup.  When you look at Libya and you think about, well, why did we go in there?  You know, if you were a cynic, you could say we went in there because the French and the Italians 
[01:15:00]  pressured us because of their oil and gas interests.  We had absolutely no critical interest in Libya.  And yet we say, well, it was human rights.  It was concern over loss of civilian life.  If that was the case, then why aren't we in Syria where, you know, Assad and his regime  have got more blood on their hands than anybody?  Are they going to lose, you think?  Are they going to be overthrown?  Assad?  Yeah.  Well, the Russians are doing everything possible to make sure that doesn't happen.  Are they helping them?  Yeah, yeah.  And there's really no big power backing the rebellion. 
[01:15:30]  No.  No, I mean, the Saudis, the Qataris, you know, the local regional players, you know, are doing,  you know, some assistance.  But it's, you know, the Syrian opposition has got to be looking around.  They're going, what the fuck's wrong with us?  Yeah, hey, wait a minute.  What are they doing for the Libyans?  Yeah.  Why are we helping them just with military armor?  Well, it's a different, if it's a much different game.  The Syrian military is much more disciplined, much more capable.  Their air defense systems are far better than the Libyans ever had, thanks to the Russians 
[01:16:00]  and the Chinese in part, and the Iranians.  And the Iranians and the Syrians are joined at the hip.  I mean, the Syrians have been the Iranians, you know, puppet and bitch for decades.  And so going into Syria creates a much different dynamic than going into Libya.  No, I don't mean going in.  I mean, just giving them, I don't want any soldiers.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't want one soldier going in there.  I mean, just giving them weapons so they can.  But then again, they'll just turn them on us.  Like, dumb fuckers that we are.  And that's the other part.  You know, everybody was holding hands during the Arab Spring thinking, you know, what a 
[01:16:30]  great deal this is.  Oh, democracy everywhere.  No, not quite.  Yeah, self-determination.  Look at this.  Yeah.  What a load of crap.  Because now we don't know what's happening.  And, you know, Libya is a good case in point.  You know, it could hold itself together, but there's still street fighting in various  towns and cities in Libya.  And then you look at Egypt.  We don't know what the hell is going to happen there.  You know, the extremists, the Salafis have taken over, you know, two-thirds of the government.  And so in, you know, back behind what happens when you overthrow a dictator is kind of chaos. 
[01:17:00]  And we don't really know how it's going to shake out.  Do you think a guy like Ron Paul, who I really grew to like, even though I know some of his  ideas I disagree with completely, but I like the idea of just getting the fuck out everywhere.  I'm so sick of us being everywhere.  Like, why are we in Germany?  Like, with weapons the way they are now, we can get a bomb anywhere we need to.  Why are we in Germany?  It's deals that were made, you know, years and years ago. 
[01:17:30]  Korea!  Why are we in Korea?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you know, forward basing.  And there's been a lot of talk about this.  How do we readjust for the new world?  And, you know, just when you think we might be getting it, and maybe we're talking about  getting out of some of these old, you know, bases like exist in Germany, Japan, Korea.  Then all of a sudden, you know, what do we do?  We spend the past 11 years nation building in Afghanistan of all places.  And you think, what the fuck is that about?  I mean, if you're concerned about being in Germany or maintaining some of these bases, 
[01:18:00]  now we're talking about a permanent presence in Iraq and Afghanistan, despite this notion about  what we might get out in 2014, good luck with that.  Yeah.  Well, we should be out.  And it's like, I was for it for a long time.  And I know that there's soldiers who went on a shooting speed.  It's just a guy who snapped, and it happens everywhere.  Yeah.  But it's like, after the Koran burning, and it just makes us look bad, and the soldiers  they catch, they're going to behead.  Like, why are we putting our guys in this situation when we get nothing out of it? 
[01:18:30]  Well, you could argue that, I mean, now the administration, this is what can drive  you fucking crazy, is after this shooting, and, you know, yes, it's unbelievably tragic,  and you can't justify what this soldier did in terms of the gunning down of these civilians,  but you've got to discuss the facts around the case, otherwise you're just burying your  head in the sand.  And this guy, according to the information, served three tours in Iraq, then was deployed  to Afghanistan.  At some point, it appears, based on some of the information that's coming out, that he  was treated for a traumatic brain injury.  That could be anything from a severe concussion to something worse. 
[01:19:00]  He's sent back out to Afghanistan.  And we need to be talking about what we've been doing to our men and women over the past,  you know, 10, 11 years in these multiple tours.  Yeah, that seems crazy.  And how we're dealing with them and taking care of them when they come home, or when we just  keep kicking them out the door saying, hey, let's do another deployment.  But, you know, now the administration is saying, well, maybe we need to accelerate the departure  from Afghanistan, because perhaps we've reached the point of diminishing returns.  Yeah.  But what the fuck, we've reached the point of diminishing returns in spring of 2002 in 
[01:19:30]  Afghanistan.  So, I don't know.  I think you're right, by the way.  I think it is a brain injury.  I don't think that, but I'm only saying the people that, you know, they're fucking, they  don't believe it.  They're all radicals.  They don't hear that shit.  What you'll see is, like, I just keep thinking, like, all right, if we had Afghani soldiers  here and they just shot a bunch of civilians, I mean, you want to just burn them alive.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, and honestly, they don't know what the hell we're talking about when we  discuss some sort of, you know, pseudo-federal government, you know, establishment.  Let's get Karzai to build this. 
[01:20:00]  What the hell?  It's a tribal village culture.  I mean, you're lucky if they exist within a tribe that extends beyond one village, much  less just, you know, okay, so they don't get the idea of some nation put together with  a centralized government, and they don't give a shit.  It doesn't make any difference to them, and frankly, I could care less whether we increase  their literacy, I can't even say the fucking word, by 2% or 3%, or I build another road there  in their country.  To me, it doesn't speak to our national security interests. 
[01:20:30]  Let them do it.  If they want it, let them do it.  Yeah.  Why are they giving these guys so many fucking tours?  I mean, this seems unprecedented in American military history to send the same people out  on this many tours without just, you know, send them home.  You're done.  You did your duty.  Great.  I mean, a lot of guys, you know, to their credit, they volunteer.  You know, for a lot of guys, you re-up, and off they go again.  Again, you look at the amount of time that these guys are spending out in the theater 
[01:21:00]  compared to, you know, previous engagements, whether you're talking Vietnam or even World  War II, where, you know, that was, it's just, it's an issue that I don't think we really  talk about.  You know, we rushed it, and again, you can't, the shootings of the civilians, you can't  justify it, but you do have to look behind it.  You have to understand, you know, what drives somebody like that to do something as desperate  as...  Apparently, you know, the guy's married, he's got two kids.  I mean, good God. 
[01:21:30]  That's just snapping.  Isn't it part of a thing, too, because we're trying to fight these wars.  Colin Quinn had said it right.  He said, we're trying to fight a polite war.  And it's like, when you pretend that you're not doing what you're doing, and it's like,  because Americans, we become so fraudulent in our motives with everything.  We just pretend that we don't do things that we do.  Yeah, yeah.  If we're going to bomb somebody, then bomb the motherfuckers, and don't send, we have to  keep sending guys in, because we're just slapping people, and then backing out.  It's like, you keep sending guys in to do that, so you're going to bomb them, bomb them.  If you're not, then don't. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  Stop sending guys in there.  It's annoying.  For some reason.  It's annoying.  But I mean, you know what I mean?  These guys are doing four tours, where if you did what you had to do, and if you wanted  to conquer a nation and get a surrender, you could have done that before anybody stepped  out of a plane.  Wars are fought now, though, on Twitter, and Facebook, and the news, obviously.  So they're held accountable for every single thing they do.  They're criticized for every single move they make, as far as a mission would go. 
[01:22:30]  It's amazing what's public knowledge now, where years ago, it would have been treason.  Right.  I mean, that's a really good point, because you think about, what if we'd had Twitter feed,  and instant video coverage on YouTube of the invasion of Normandy?  Normandy, yeah.  Could you imagine the first day, what the public reaction would have been?  You've got to be shitting me.  Yeah.  We would have been the fuck out of there.  People would have been apologizing left and right, saying, well, we really can't get  back in there for the next day. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah, yeah.  So let's look at a different alternative here.  Yeah.  How many people got killed?  That's crazy.  Oh, my God.  They're tweeting pictures of bodies in the water.  Yeah.  You've got some poor soldier.  They're about to let the gate down.  He's going to get on the beach.  He goes, well, you know, we're about to let the gate down.  I mean, it's been pretty good so far.  Yeah.  I mean, so it is that.  It's that direct feed.  It's the fatigue that we all feel after, you know, more than a decade of doing something  that we, quite frankly, I think the American public looks at it and says, wait a minute.  Again, how does this relate to the problem that we went in there for? 
[01:23:30]  We had a real specific mission when we went in there after 9-11, and we accomplished that  mission.  Right.  And at that point, we should have just said, fine, you know, lights out.  If you do it again, we're coming back.  But the idea that it morphed into this nation building exercise.  With no, got no education from when the Soviets were in there.  No, no lesson learned from that.  Yeah.  Absolutely not.  Hey, we had to think, too.  Israel was doing that.  This was annoying me so much.  We're fucking giving. 
[01:24:00]  The Jews would come into this.  No, but we're giving money.  They're great allies.  We're giving money to Israel to build those.  What are those bombs that they, those?  Yeah.  Protection.  The Iron Dome system.  The Iron Dome.  But they're built in Israel?  Yeah.  I don't want to fucking hear that they're expensive.  How about a little national pride if it's defending your country?  And I love, again, I would say this about England or France or Italy or any of our allies.  If it's defending your nation, how about you fucking have a guy come into work and not  get paid for the day instead of the American dumb taxpayers sending money over there? 
[01:24:30]  Hmm.  Yeah.  We're giving a country money to build something critical to their defense by their citizens.  What are we, fucking assholes?  How stupid are we?  Apparently we are.  If it's in your interest to build that, then build it by all means.  They should have some type of tax structure that would give them what they need.  What the fuck are we doing?  People are unemployed and we're all complaining about money and we're giving money away to  build something that they built in another country? 
[01:25:00]  It's stupid.  One of the most amazing things is the fact that we're giving money to Egypt still.  And, you know, who knows what's going on there, like you said, and they're holding people.  Right.  It's like a hostage situation with ransom.  Yeah, we don't turn the ship very well.  So when conditions change, and Egypt's a great point because of the amount of money that  we've stuffed into their bank over the years, when conditions change, you'd like to think  that, you know, we're quick enough to say, okay, let's step back and reevaluate this. 
[01:25:30]  You know, before we just keep automatically, you know, writing that check, let's see who  we're sending the money to right now.  And there's a lot of confusion.  All those earnest young people who got out in the streets, the men and the women and  the girls that got out there thinking, yeah, it's a new day.  It's democracy.  And then suddenly they realize, oh, hold on, how's, you know, that Muslim Brotherhood and  the Slavis are suddenly in charge.  Yeah.  Or the tanks rolling toward the, towards us.  Yeah, what the hell's this all about?  And now you got, you know, you got the military and you got the extremists kind of staring each 
[01:26:00]  other down trying to figure out who's going to be ultimately in charge.  The people that were absolutely responsible for getting out in the streets in the first  place, they don't have a say in anything out there.  No.  So, but you're right.  I mean, we, we, and Israel's a good point.  Although I think that to be fair, I mean, I think there's an Israeli company that, that  has designed or has been building one of those Iron Dome systems.  I think Boeing's been involved in the other one.  So I think Boeing has gotten, you know, some of the, some of the upside from creating a  system, but not much.  And of course, a lot of people talking about the Israel and Iran situation. 
[01:26:30]  Is there something going on there?  Yeah, there might be something.  I don't know.  Something about, well, I don't follow the news.  I don't, uh, me neither.  Uh, do you think Israel will do it or will fucking, will dumb, dumb Uncle Sam stick our  fucking stupid noses in again and do it for, for, for them?  We're not going to have, if Israel decides to go on their own, we're not going to have  any choice.  We're going to have to get involved.  And, you know, despite, you know, the administration and Obama's doing everything he can to make 
[01:27:00]  sure this doesn't happen before the election.  I mean, he's really working that angle and he got the British to, to get on side and say  the same thing.  Well, we don't really think that taking military action, you know, in the next few  months is really going to accomplish anything, you know, certainly before November.  Yeah.  And, you know, so who knows what the hell is going to happen.  But I think the Israelis, uh, realized at this point, you know, that we're not going  to, you know, lead the charge.  We're not going to get on board and proactively, you know, work with them to find a military 
[01:27:30]  solution to this.  So if they're going to go that route, they're going to have to start it.  And then we're going to have to come in behind and assist.  And who is the, there was the head of the, the former head of the Mossad was interviewed  on 60 minutes.  And he was saying that he did thought it was a bad move, uh, public, normally those guys  don't come speak out publicly, but he thought it was a terrible move because there's so  many, there's a way more than just a few places where they have weapons.  So you're only going to delay it.  You're not going to stop it.  And he thinks that Ahmadinejad is more, uh, uh, reasonable than people think he is in  his own way. 
[01:28:00]  He's not as crazy as everybody thinks.  I think he's as crazy as everybody thinks.  Um, but I think he's, he's, he's, he's, he's not as in charge as sometimes people think.  So the clerics are running a show over there and they've been, uh, increasingly at odds with  Ahmadinejad.  He has less authority and, and honestly is on his way out anyway.  I mean, you know, due to term limits, term limits, but he's trying to put his own guy  in charge when he takes off.  That's not going to happen.  And so the clerics are going to be there. 
[01:28:30]  The clerics are not completely crazy.  Uh, and they understand that if they were to do something stupid, like close the straits  of Hormuz, that that would prompt the U S that would sort of give us the invitation then  at that point to say, okay, well, we've tried everything else.  Now we've got to go in.  But once again, you know, we talk about the sanctions.  We say, well, give the sanctions time to work.  Well, the Russians yet again, and the Chinese acting on their own best interests have no interest  in screwing down the Iranians on the sanctions.  Right.  So no matter what we want to do and our allies want to do, the Russians, the Chinese are always 
[01:29:00]  going to go through the back door and the Iranians aren't going to necessarily feel all  the pain we'd like them to feel.  The sanctions work though.  Haven't we been, haven't we been kicking and screaming for 50 years about Cuba and nobody  gives a shit that we have sanctions on Cuba?  Oh, Cuba.  I mean that up.  That old chestnut.  Why don't we just stop with Cuba?  We didn't get our way.  Yeah, we should have, I agree with that.  They're not bothering us.  You know what we should have done?  If we had started selling, you know, hamburgers and Coke, you know, in, uh, in Cuba 40 years 
[01:29:30]  ago, we'd be gambling there now, you know, casino records on the beaches, right?  How nice would that be?  Why is Obama not opening?  He seems like the guy who would, there's obviously, I know there's big sugar interest here.  And he seemed like the guy who was going to close Gitmo too.  Yeah, that's one of those situations where I think the president, uh, is advised on Cuba  and, uh, advised on how it should be handled.  I don't think he could just go, Hey, let's open up Cuba.  Come on, let's bring those cigars in.  Yeah.  He says that publicly.  Then he goes back in his office and then some mysterious guy comes out and says, sir, 
[01:30:00]  let me just show you, gives him the book.  I'll show you some stuff about Cuba.  What's the, what's the reason?  I don't know.  I think there's a book that just, you know, outlines why you can't do certain things.  And the president learns about it when he comes into power and then he, he, he acts accordingly.  And that's why the last, you know, 12, 13 presidents haven't done anything.  Do you think that's why too?  Cause I, for some reason, I don't, I, Obama doesn't strike me as a bald faced liar.  He just doesn't strike me as, as a guy who's a, I think he's too much of an idealist to  be a complete liar.  Like as a politician, he's a liar. 
[01:30:30]  He's a politician.  But I don't think he's as complete a liar as a lot of them are.  And it's like, what do you think happens?  You get in, I'm talking a lot.  I apologize.  When you get into a show, when you get into office, McLaughlin and company, I'm just gammering.  When you get into office, you really do learn things.  I guess you didn't know when you were campaigning and then you have to appear either wishy  washy or you can stick with what you knew or you said and go against what's smart.  Yeah.  I mean, I think, again, I get more, I think is a case in point, um, the drone program.  I think he came in. 
[01:31:00]  I agree with that.  I don't think any of these guys come in, you know, uh, planning to lie or screw over the  nation.  I think it's just, you know, they're politicians, you know, and that it's a certain breed of  people, but I think he came in, he sat down and, you know, he started getting the, the  big boy briefings and they, they talked about some of these issues and he got more intelligence  than he had when he was, you know, running for president, uh, or even, you know, the period  of time while he was in the Senate and you make a decision.  You realize, okay, I can't actually do that because that's not the way the world works 
[01:31:30]  and it doesn't fit with my campaign rhetoric.  So I'm going to look a little bit wishy washy, like you said, but that's happened with every  president, every president, they've said things and then realize once they're in there that,  ah, well, that's maybe not the right move.  Do you think the, do you think the, I'll get back to you on that campaign would be successful?  If a guy ran for it, that was his whole thing.  Signs, I'll get back to you on that.  Sooner or later, we'll know.  Sooner or later, we'll know.  That's a good bumper sticker, too.  It might help with the, uh, Republicans, uh, this year. 
[01:32:00]  Jesus.  Oh, it's great.  New for Santorum.  It's terrific.  Yeah, yeah, that's great.  Yeah, that's what we need.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Things are looking really good on the Republican side.  Man, people don't understand, like, like, uh, the conservatives are gonna vote Republican.  It doesn't matter what the, what the fuck you do.  Yeah.  Uh, I think to get those independents and maybe some of these disenfranchised Democrats,  you need somebody that's gonna be able to get, well, they already have the conservatives. 
[01:32:30]  They're not going anywhere.  They're not voting for Obama.  Right.  Put it that way.  You could do anything.  They're not.  You need someone that's gonna pick up the middle, and, uh, I think Romney's the guy that could  do that because, uh, you know, he's known as a, uh, not, not that conservative.  Right.  Right.  Um, and, and if he's just the one guy left, he could start showing more of his, uh, middle  than he can now because the second he steps out of the far right, they go, he's not a  true conservative.  I know.  Tell us that a little bit.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:33:00]  What is a true conservative?  Stop.  No, I'm pretty convinced the Republicans are gonna, you know, the, the various, you know,  interests are gonna fall on their little principled swords over this, and, and, you know, they're  gonna realize in November that they've lost the election.  Yeah.  And, you know, I, you know, I agree with you.  There's no, anybody who tries to argue that somehow Santorum can, can capture that 10% independent  vote or whatever it is.  It can happen.  Yeah.  How does, how does that work?  Yeah.  You know, and, and then they argue, well, you know, all those conservatives are just gonna stay  home in November if it's somebody like Romney.  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:33:30]  No.  Really?  You think so?  You know, I'm pretty sure you can make the case that it's better to do that than to maintain  the status quo if you're on that side of the equation.  Exactly.  That's, that's, you know, that's the, the thinking behind Santorum is, you know, he, he's  got the conservatives.  Right.  Big deal.  It doesn't matter who's in there.  They're gonna get the conservatives.  They're gonna vote against Obama.  But, I mean, right now it's a slugfest between Santorum and Gingrich, right?  So, so if you look at some of the headlines coming out of yesterday's results, they're barely 
[01:34:00]  talking about Romney because everybody's interested in saying this, this is gonna cause  Newt to drop out, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  I gotta hope he stays in because I'm fascinated.  He just sort of gone off on this crazy train about 250, you know, gasoline.  Yeah.  And that's just all he talks about anymore.  Yeah.  I got a plan, 250 for gasoline.  I'm bringing it down.  And it's gonna be $2.50 regardless of what anybody else may say.  Yeah, they want you to share that information whether you win or not.  Help everybody out.  Yeah, it would be a good idea.  Yeah, yeah.  Because if he did, it would go down and then Obama would take credit for it and get credit 
[01:34:30]  for it and look at where he brought gas prices down.  No, I'm glad if he, if he even does have an idea.  But I, you kind of know what any idea would be to get gas prices down.  Is say that, you don't even have to do it.  Say you're going to be opening up the refineries.  Say that you're going with that pipeline, the Keystone pipeline.  That would bring prices down.  It'd bring prices down.  But I mean, there's other market, you know, factors at play, obviously. 
[01:35:00]  And he can't control what happens overseas in terms of the volatility, what goes on with Iran.  So it just, it just seems to me, because, you know, Gingrich, I think, is a smart guy.  You know, I don't have a dog in the hunt in this one, but he seems like a smart guy.  He's certainly got some baggage.  But, you know, to go off on this path, it just seems odd, right?  I guess maybe he's trying to differentiate himself.  But, yeah, bottom line, I just think they're shooting themselves in the foot.  It's one big self-inflicted move.  It really is, man.  I do like the fact that Gingrich is pretty much the only one really getting on Obama at this point. 
[01:35:30]  You know, they're all beating the shit out of each other.  And he's willing to get up there and say, hey, Obama, your gas prices suck.  Your foreign policy stinks.  He's willing to do that.  I mean, Romney tries, right?  But every time he tries to turn this thing back around to some sort of presidential campaign where he's facing Romney or facing Obama, then, you know, what do you got?  Then you got Santorum and Gingrich and Ron Paul kind of nipping at his heels.  And he's got to turn back around.  And you continue to have this infighting. 
[01:36:00]  And it takes us on one big Republican knife fight.  Why don't we hold that against people?  Like, why, when they just attack each other, when they run against the opposite party, why don't we just go, yeah, but what about all that shit you said?  And in these words, what about all that shit you said about the guy who is now your running mate?  Why don't we do nothing?  Like, all they should have done was ask Obama and Biden questions about things they said about each other.  How can you run with him when you said this?  It's Joe.  It's Joe. 
[01:36:30]  Who doesn't like Joe Biden?  He's an entertaining sort.  He's a very competitive man, and we were competing, so things are said that, you know.  And it makes each other tougher, and you become a better candidate if you, you know, beat the shit out of each other during these primaries.  Definitely have answers for all those dumbass questions, I bet.  You know what?  Term limits and campaign finance reform.  As far as I'm concerned, if you could get term limits, and, you know, obviously, you know, the president theoretically can only run for two terms.  But, you know, in the Congress and the Senate, and if you could get serious campaign finance reform so that, you know, and even put fucking time limits on the amount of time you could run for office, right, in terms of, okay, this campaign will only go for four months. 
[01:37:00]  If you can't get your point across in four months' time and say a million dollars, you're a fucking idiot, right?  If you've got to spend $800 or $900 million over the course of two years, what the fuck does that say about us?  We just want rich guys running the – I don't want to sound like I'm some hipster, dumpster-diving hipster.  But it's like we wonder why they don't relate to us, and we have a system set up where only a guy who, again, can spend that – Bloomberg spent $100 million to run New York. 
[01:37:30]  I mean, how does she have that – I mean, she's got the money.  She's got the money.  But, I mean, it's still – it's a tremendous amount of money to spend to do a gig, to do a job.  How do you compare it to that?  And then I read yesterday that Biden was hosting a $10,000-a-plate fundraising dinner.  I was at that.  And – oh, were you?  Yeah.  How was it?  Delicious.  I didn't even say.  I just had the food.  It was wonderful.  $10,000-a-plate.  But – and then he started talking to the people and saying how the Republicans don't know how the common man feels. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  $10,000-a-plate.  And he's preaching that the common man is overlooked by the Republicans.  But you're right.  Money is such a huge factor in politics that it's completely separated them from the regular guy and what makes up this country.  There should be a certain amount of money you can spend, and everyone gets to spend that amount. 
[01:38:30]  Right.  And that's it.  Because otherwise it's just the more money you make, the better you can campaign.  And it's just such horseshit.  I mean, the Democrats say, well, the Republicans are the party of big money.  Well, the Republicans haven't been the party of big money in decades, frankly.  They're both doing it, right?  Yeah.  So the Democrats are complaining about the Republican super PACs, and I think they're just kind of pissed off because their super PACs aren't raising as much money as the Republican super PACs right now.  But they will.  And so they all just kind of go back and forth, and it's all the same bullshit.  But if you can just once quit the self-serving bullshit and say, look, let's enact this finance reform. 
[01:39:00]  Let's be serious about it.  Let's set limits.  And then on the Congress and the Senate in terms of the time that they can run.  I mean, you look at Congress.  Two years.  As soon as you get in there, you're worried about getting reelected, right?  And if you go back a few hundred years, back to when our fathers founded this place, it was because for two years that was all anybody could possibly imagine serving and going to Washington and sitting in that swamp.  Nobody wanted to do it.  They didn't want to be there for that. 
[01:39:30]  They had farms to run.  They had things to do.  So it was a different time.  It was an agrarian culture.  Let's adjust.  And let's say congressmen can have two four-year terms, and that's it.  Go back and get a fucking job.  Do something real.  And then Senate, you know, two six-year terms.  If you can't do the job in eight years or 12 years as a congressman or a senator, then what the fuck's wrong with you?  Yeah, what are you still doing in there?  And then you get rid of the self-serving interests, right?  Because if I'm a lobbyist and I know that I've got a senator and he might be there for the next 36 years, I've got a serious vested interest in putting my money into that individual. 
[01:40:00]  If he's on the Ways and Means Committee or he's in defense or whatever.  But if I know that there's going to be churn in the mix and these guys are going to keep rotating, then their value drops as far as I'm concerned.  New guys coming in, old guy going out.  You're not going to be compelled to give this guy a shitload of money and favors if he's just going to be out the door.  So keep things a little more honest.  You should do a torch and pitchfork campaign.  Get the people out on the Capitol Hill and insist on it.  Mob rules. 
[01:40:30]  Absolutely.  And I say each candidate should be given $175 to spend however he or she will on their campaign.  Wow.  It's like a high school campaign for a class president.  Bunch of poster board and fluorescent paint.  But you know it's going to be Romney.  It's going to be the guy.  And it's like I'm watching these stupid debates and it's like just the way they're set up for the camera.  Romney's in the center.  It's so before it even happens, you already know who it's going to be. 
[01:41:00]  I'm going to keep saying Ron Paul because I like him.  Do I think his views on evolution are good?  Look at his 4% over there and his 5% in Alabama.  Well, he would do better.  I'll tell you one thing.  He would do a lot better in those places if he would come out and say what he really feels about gays.  But he, I don't believe it is pro-gay at all.  But he won't say what he really, he won't be as hardcore about gay.  Where do you get that?  He's an old religious guy.  He's, I don't believe that he likes homosexuals at all. 
[01:41:30]  But I don't think he'll say that.  No, because he's a really weird base.  But no, he believes in, you know, 6,000 years of earth and all that shit.  Those are not guys who really care for the gay community or not.  But I think he's just been smart and not said it.  I like him.  I mean, in a way, I like some of the things he says.  You know, you can't have a guy like that with his foreign policy, you know, beliefs running a country.  Oh, I love it.  Yeah, yeah.  Although, again, you go back to what you were saying earlier in terms of the isolationism.  I'm not an isolationist.  But at the same time, you know, you look at some of the bullshit we've been doing over the past decade. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  I saw a figure the other day that could make you bang your head against the wall.  The cost of one soldier, one of our soldiers in Afghanistan, per year, $850,000.  Sure.  Wow.  And how does that work?  Yeah.  Stop feeding these guys so much.  They're only having a good time in their lives.  Apparently we're giving them too much gear.  Take the gear and food away.  No air conditioning for these guys.  Cremadonna.  Living it up over there.  We're going to have to cut back the number of bullets we give you. 
[01:42:30]  We don't want you to shoot them anyway.  As a Republican, what do you think a Republican would be?  What do you think the best interest would be?  Obama getting reelected with a majority of Republicans in the House and Senate or the other way around, Republican president and the Democrats running the show.  You're asking me or Mike?  I have both.  Whatever.  Hit your buzzer.  Yeah.  Hit your buzzer. 
[01:43:00]  I think if Obama wins, we can hopefully eke out a majority to keep him in check a bit.  But, yeah, honestly, I'm so disgusted with both sides at this point that I don't know that it really makes a difference anymore because we just allow them to get away with so much bullshit that I don't know that it really matters.  And I know that, yes, okay, in a big picture, I suppose you can make the argument that I'm not for a big government. 
[01:43:30]  Just stay the fuck out of my wheelhouse.  Don't get up in my kitchen, whatever you want to call it.  And, you know, I'd like a little bit more accountability for the way that we spend our money and yada, yada, yada.  I think we're losing that sense of American exceptionalism.  I think that there's a, you know, every generation just seems to get softer.  I don't know that that's a government-driven thing.  I think we're just, there's part in the culture that I don't think is driven by the government, but we're getting softer. 
[01:44:00]  And we're losing that ability to say, you know, just pull your boots up and get busy.  Oh, no, this is the, the new millennium is the millennium of the apology.  Yeah.  It's just, you know, say you're sorry, you hurt someone's feelings.  And if you, even if you apologize, well, thanks for the apology, but get your ass out.  You're fired.  It's just, nobody has any, nobody has a thick skin anymore for anything.  No one knows how to just turn around and go, really? 
[01:44:30]  Well, screw you.  Yeah.  Well, it's just accountability and consequences.  You take responsibility for your own fuck-ups and for your actions.  And, you know, quit trying to blame everybody else.  Quit expecting shit to happen.  Yeah.  You got to work to get things right.  You got to work.  And, you know, if you work a little bit harder than the guy on your left or your right, you're probably going to do better.  You know, and, and if you don't, well, then you can whine and complain, but, you know, but, but, but make the effort and work and don't just expect shit to get handed to you.  And I don't know, but, but, but I think, again, I don't know that that's, you know, completely government driven. 
[01:45:00]  I think that there's, there is something going on over the generations, you know, since whenever, you know.  I wonder what that is, what the, the motivating factor is that made, uh, made the country go in this direction.  Well, I think people came out of the depression, people came out of World War II convinced that they, you know, I'll be damned if my kid's going to have to go through that.  We're going to make it a better life.  We're going to, we're going to, and, and, and each successive generation, I mean, you know, I'm guilty of the same thing, you know, although I will say, you know, I've seen it with a, I got a daughter, I got three little boys and I coddled my daughter, you know, that's just, that's a dad daughter thing. 
[01:45:30]  And my boys, you know, they get a sucking chest wound and I'm like, you know, hey, hey, get up.  You're fine.  Hey, come on, walk it off.  Yeah.  You'll be, you know, we'll just slap a bandage on that and we'll be fine.  You got a compression bandage, anybody?  Yeah.  But, you know, but you just, I think you need to, yeah.  So when you say, you know, Republican, Democrat, I'm just getting to the point where I'm thinking, oh, what the fuck?  I just want to get more ammo and, you know, more fuel and more water on my property and wait for the zombies to come over the wall. 
[01:46:00]  Well, you don't have to work as hard for things anymore, like information.  Like you can find out years ago you had to work hard to get information.  If you wanted to just learn something, who is that actor?  You had to call somebody or you had to look at, so literally now you can get information immediately.  So it's like everybody's getting softer because you're finding out things quicker.  You don't need to do what you used to need to do.  Calling a friend because it was like, who was that actor in that movie? 
[01:46:30]  And your friend would be like, oh, yeah, it's going to tip my tongue.  That was your only recourse.  It was phone a friend.  You had to phone a friend for all your problems.  Or you'd get to your encyclopedia off the bookshelf.  Yeah, yeah.  Do you remember?  Trying to look it up.  And that thing was dated.  No one ever had an up-to-date encyclopedia.  I've got to write a report for school, so I'm going to have to walk to the library and hope that someone hasn't checked out the book on ancient Middle Eastern history.  Yeah.  But, no, you're right.  I mean, it's instant access. 
[01:47:00]  And that also drives this belief that everything's got to happen immediately.  I was on a plane the other day.  I sat next to it.  I wasn't coach.  I wasn't up in first class with Jimmy.  Did everybody laugh at you?  They did.  They did.  What are you doing back here?  We thought you were so important, dude.  And so I'm sitting back there, and they had Wi-Fi on the plane, which to me still strikes me as an amazing thing.  Amazing.  And, anyway, this guy next to me was getting pissed off because his shit wasn't downloading fast enough.  And we're at 32,000 feet. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And he's upset because he's not getting his website downloaded inside of five seconds.  And you think about that.  And you think about the immediacy of everything and how people expect a beginning, a middle, and an end straight away.  People are bored if the story goes on for more than two minutes.  You know, they can't be bothered.  And, you know, that also drives the way things work.  You look at the kids and the way that they, you know, the video games are, the cartoons, you know, the movies.  Everything's got to happen like that because no one's got the patience to sit through something.  To sit through a storyline or have an ebb and flow, a dynamic to a story. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  You appreciate the high points in a story and those big moments when it comes after a little bit of a lull.  But, yeah, everything's got to be here on 10.  Right.  And then they get bored with it anyway and walk away.  You can get a song, like on an iPhone, if you want a song, you can just be out in the street and think of a song and press your button and go on your iTunes and your phone and download it.  Like, that's how fast. 
[01:48:30]  So everyone's getting spoiled because we're all getting what we want.  And once 3D printers are in the house and you can just home shop and it makes you what you want, which it really will do that.  I mean, you know, in our lifetimes, we'll see that.  Like a transporter for things.  That's what it sounds like, yeah.  I want that sweater and it's going to beam into my hole.  I don't know how it works.  Jeff Dunham was explaining to us how it worked.  Like, he makes his own dummies and stuff with his 3D printer.  And they're already making, like, human cells on the really advanced ones.  Is he making, like, a love doll on his 3D printer?  Yeah, you know, that doesn't sound good. 
[01:49:00]  I can only imagine what he's doing.  A really good one.  I look at it like a fleshlight.  What the hell is it?  Oh, yeah, look at that.  Look at the time we should take another break, huh?  Take a little break.  Uh-oh, what?  What's that?  Okay.  Oh, well.  Well.  Oh, a cue card.  Yeah, really.  I guess I should have just said it then.  That would have been smoother, actually.  Yeah.  Club Soda Kenny, you have some type of announcement? 
[01:49:30]  Well, since you guys were talking about the military, I thought this was an appropriate segue into what I wanted to mention.  Anything for our troops.  Yeah, so it's a benefit for the Wounded Warrior Project.  On April 16th, honor, courage, and commitment run.  It's cops and Marines are going to run from the Purple Heart Memorial at Journal Square in Jersey City, 600 miles, to the Beirut Memorial in Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. 
[01:50:00]  And all the proceeds go to the Wounded Warriors.  They've been doing this since 1985.  So, you can go on hccrun.com.  You can donate money on PayPal or if you're crazy enough to run 600 miles.  But, you know, it's for a worthy cause, the Wounded Warriors.  What is that, a one-day event?  Yeah, right?  Is it in a row?  What's that?  Well, I bet the Marines do better than the cops. 
[01:50:30]  I've seen some fat cops lately.  Yeah.  Cops are eating a lot.  Yeah.  Walking through Times Square yesterday.  Holy shit.  NYPD.  You know, maybe a couple of sit-ups.  Jesus.  Yeah, most cops give others a bad name for themselves.  So, how long is this event?  Like, what do they do?  Run an extra amount of miles and then sleep?  Is it a marathon a day or 10 miles a day for two months?  Have you ever seen Farris Gump?  Yes, I have.  Many times.  They just all get together and run. 
[01:51:00]  I was running.  How are you?  I think it's very minimal sleep.  They just keep running and get very minimal sleep.  But that's how I do it, Kenny.  Bing, boom.  Keep running.  Are they going to run to Orlando tomorrow, Friday and Saturday?  I have to say that some of the guys are so overzealous.  They're going to run to Orlando to see me at the improv.  You're at the Orlando improv.  They're going to blow right by Virginia and run to Orlando.  Well, it would be worth the run, the extra mile. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, and there'd be plenty of tickets for all the participants.  Oh, Jimmy.  Another dud market.  No, why?  I would think Orlando's a shooting improv, right?  I wouldn't think it.  We're some mouse ears.  Maybe that'll do it.  Oh, Disney theme.  Bring the kids in.  Dress as your favorite Disney princess.  Yes.  Yes.  Dress as a Disney princess.  Get a kiss from Jimmy.  Another wonderful weekend on the road. 
[01:52:00]  Oh.  Yeah.  Did you think you would still be doing this on the road?  More successfully.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It happens at its own, you know, you could do what you do, but then.  It happens at its own pace.  It's own pace.  You know, you could do what you do.  You're a very motivated guy, Jimmy.  You really are.  You're not lazy with your career.  But sometimes it's like you need that little fucking element of whatever it is.  That happenstance.  Pizazz.  No, you got pizazz. 
[01:52:30]  Spunk?  He's got spunk.  He's got spunk.  He's got spunk.  He hates spunk.  Hi, Roland.  Roland in the hizzy.  Why don't we take a break?  Yes, we should.  And we'll come back with more of the show.  And as we go to break.  Oh, Jesus.  Who is that?  A new how much.  Oh, I love these.  All right.  Here you go.  Have you ever wondered how many cubic feet of flatulence it would take to lift a hot air balloon?  How many peanut M&Ms would it take to fill the average dog colon? 
[01:53:00]  Well, wonder no more, friends.  Join me on my journey for knowledge, seeking out answers to the questions man has pondered since the dawn of time.  On today's episode, how much period blood would it take to fill a Chevy Trailblazer?  The average total menstrual cycle discharge measures five tablespoons.  That's 74 milliliters or two and a half clumpy shots of coppery goodness.  Bottoms up.  The usable interior volume of a Chevy Trailblazer measures 125 and a half cubic feet or approximately 939 gallons. 
[01:53:30]  That means it would take 240,384 tablespoons to fill the Chevy Trailblazer to capacity with uterus.  That's enough period blood for 48,078 periods.  That's enough women to fill every seat of Safeco Field.  More like Mushrooms and Pennies Field.  LOL.  If one woman were to account for all that period blood, she would have to be perioding for over 4,000 years.  In the business, we call that YOP, or years of period. 
[01:54:00]  What did you say?  You want a how much bonus round?  Well, okay, fans.  How many tampons would it take to soak up all that bitching, crying, and needless spending?  Well, let's see.  The average woman goes through an estimated 20 tampons per cycle.  Using our previously calculated figure of 48,078 periods to fill that Chevy Trailblazer,  we would need to go through 961,560 tampons to clean that mess up. 
[01:54:30]  That's enough tampons to cross the Great Salt Lake at its widest point.  Now that's what I call one heavy flow.  Get it?  Join us next time for an all-new edition of How Much.  The ONA Show presents True Confessions from Anthony Cumia. 
[01:55:00]  I like putting on women's underwear every so often, those silky ones.  You look funny with the top of your boner sticking up.  That was another True Confessions from Anthony Cumia on the OBN Anthony Show.  This is next time.  Three things down.  The OBN Anthony Show. 
[01:55:30]  Wah, wah.  Oh, man.  What a day, huh?  Beautiful out.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah, we really, I think, turned the old corner as far as winter goes,  which wasn't much of a winter anyway.  I'm very happy with that.  I'm thinking early opening of the compound pool.  Whoa!  Early opening.  We're talking within the first week of April.  Then at least I could, Jimmy's getting naked.  But then at least I could use the jacuzzi, 
[01:56:00]  even if my pool isn't heated fully until maybe May.  Do you have to get the maintenance done on the fountains?  Yeah, a couple of the cherub's penises clogged up over the winter.  Cherub yeast infections.  There's too much of Anthony's saliva in them.  Yeah, you turn the water on and it comes out like you had sex the night before  and didn't pee until the morning.  You know, right?  Sprinkler.  No. 
[01:56:30]  Anyway.  Yeah, I'm definitely thinking of opening it up,  cranking the heat up,  getting my $2,500 a month heating bill.  Get that started in April.  Yeah, get it started early.  It'll really start.  I'm the kind of guy that keeps the economy going.  How long will you keep the pool open for?  November.  No.  Yeah.  As long as it's heated.  Yeah, it's heated.  So you'll have a $2,500 a month bill for seven months?  You don't care.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, you know, it's what you enjoy in life. 
[01:57:00]  You've got to grab for the brass ring, as they say.  Good boy, yeah.  Yeah.  It is a lot of money.  It's worth it, though.  Oh, to go into a pool that's 95 degrees.  And if there's a chilly night, it looks like a scene out of Apocalypse Now.  It's just steam.  I come out with a headband and a gun.  Yeah.  I really...  And we had a mild winter, but I just fucking love summer. 
[01:57:30]  I love being able to just run out of the house, fucking T-shirt on,  jacket bundling up,  not worrying about scraping your windshield.  Although, I don't think I had to scrape the windshield once this year.  Maybe during that October thing.  Did we have snow in October?  We did, just before Halloween.  Yeah, just before Halloween.  That was it.  And now everything's great.  Hunky-dory, I say.  Was your pool on still on Halloween?  Oh, wow.  You know, I was trying to keep it open for the Halloween party.  And that fell through. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, it got to the point where it was...  It was a more brutal winter before Halloween than it was after Halloween.  So, no, I had to make the call.  Just became a real comedy of errors.  It certainly did, Jim.  Jim, Jim's running around the studio in various states of undress and opening little zippers  and finding things.  What was wrong with your other pants?  What did you change your pants?  Yeah, what happened?  I took my sweats off and put on my jeans.  I have a meeting today with some people who are doing my special at 11. 
[01:58:30]  And that's what you changed into?  Well, my jeans, but I got to change my shirt and sweater.  Oh.  But I'm not going to change the shirt and sweater now.  Sweater boy cutie?  Yeah, even though I'm doing WW, I mean, I'm still going to wear a sweater.  Is it a Van Heusen sweater?  No, it's a fucking Blooming's.  That's how you abbreviate Bloomingdale's.  Blooming's?  Is it a cardigan like Rick Santorum wears?  Oh, is he a cardigan?  Those things are so hip.  His haircut's really cool, too.  He's not enraging to look at.  He looks like one of the most out-of-touch individuals I've ever seen. 
[01:59:00]  He stinks to hide.  I very rarely, especially as a comic, I don't like to hate the conservative  because it's too easy and it's too typical of comedians,  but this is a guy, I guess I hate him, but I genuinely dislike him.  Yeah.  Genuinely, he makes me sick to my stomach.  Yeah, he's one of those way too fucking...  Adam's very conservative, but I love Sean.  I really do.  I like him very much.  I think Sean gets a joke, right? 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Off mic occasionally, he's willing to throw a good line out there.  Well, I haven't been on that show in a while.  A good racial epithet.  No, I'm kidding, of course.  I'm a little upset about that.  I will be on Friday.  I haven't been on in a while.  Oh!  I'll be discussing things with Hannity on the great, great, great, great, great, great,  great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great,  great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great panel.  Yeah, you should be on the great commenters panel.  You have views.  Oh, me.  I'm a patriot.  You know me.  You're not a pinhead? 
[02:00:00]  No, pinheads and patriots.  Do you do O'Reilly's?  I don't.  I've done it a few times, but, you know, I have not done the Hannity show.  Wow, you'd be great on Hannity.  No, mention it to him when you're there.  I absolutely will.  Tell him I'd be great on that great panel.  You are everything on Fox.  I think you're on there.  You know, I haven't done Hannity.  I don't know whether I said something to upset him or not smart enough.  Not smart enough.  You should see some people on that panel.  Me.  Yeah, exactly.  Not smart enough.  Well, look at the looks. 
[02:00:30]  The guy who can't rip.  Yeah, what about the?  I've seen this thing.  Yeah, people have been giving me that link, the double-barreled 1911-45.  What the hell gimmick is this?  It's a, what do you need a double-barreled 1911 for?  I don't know.  Honestly, I just saw it, and I clicked on it.  I haven't seen this yet.  When you thought it was, it was all over.  18 rounds, payload exceeding 4,000 grains, can be delivered to the target in about three seconds. 
[02:01:00]  Oh.  Yeah.  When you need to put 18 rounds into one target.  Three seconds for the bolt to hit you?  That's a lot of time to move.  Am I right or wrong?  Am I right or wrong, right?  That looks a little awkward to hold.  It's very wide.  Double-barrel's big, right?  Well, I've never seen it.  Is double-barrel meaning two bullets come out?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah, two bullets come out at the same time.  Do they have double-barrel handguns?  That's just it.  That's all I've seen now. 
[02:01:30]  I don't know if it's the first one.  So you've got to basically stand sideways in between them and help them zip right by you.  Do some Matrix shit.  Yeah.  It just looks bizarre.  No, you know what?  It looks over-engineered, and it just looks like it's designed for a cock-up.  That thing will jam on you?  What company's putting that out?  I think it's like Arsenal something right now.  Is that illegal to own?  I don't know.  Arsenal firearms.  New AF-2011, then you moved the screen on me. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, sorry.  I'd say in New York it's probably illegal.  Do you know gangsters are going to love that shit?  Oh, look.  It can be ordered in a number of configurations, including either two independent triggers and  one seer group, or with two triggers permanently joined.  Oh.  Yeah.  So you could shoot one at a time with one of the configurators.  Wow.  45 caliber on you, so you can, duh.  Yeah, I mean, it's an interesting idea, but yeah, it's a gangster weapon.  I mean, that's just.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But wait a minute.  Double.  You shoot one at a time.  Wouldn't it be hard to aim that way? 
[02:02:30]  You would think, right?  Yeah.  It just gives you twice the ammo.  Look at this.  Look at this guy demonstrating it.  Look at this dice bag demonstrating it.  He's got, like, a shaved head.  He's trying to be all badass.  Like, you hear this?  We hear this guy, Sam.  Nothing says badass like a button-down shirt and a sport coat.  I'm menacing.  Is he English?  Here he goes.  Now he's all dramatic.  A little bit of smoke.  Smokey gun.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are those gloves he's wearing?  Yes.  Nice. 
[02:03:00]  Takes the mag out.  Now, this was eight double rounds with the Arsenal Firearms 2011,  second century double barrel pistol.  Oh, no.  Where's he from?  In other words, it was 3,000 grains of payload sent downrange in about five seconds.  Downrange.  To achieve the same result with a single-barrel 9mm pistol,  we would need to shoot about 30 rounds with two changes to magazine.  All right.  You've got to shoot 30 rounds.  You're fucked up anyway.  Yeah.  What are you shooting at? 
[02:03:30]  What are you talking about?  There's no gun battle that goes like that.  Good God.  Every time I've seen security footage of gun battles,  they look silly as hell, first of all.  Absolutely.  They never look like either party knows what they're doing.  It's one of those over-the-top-of-the-counter at a convenience store,  the periscope shooting, you know?  Well, even the qualified, when you look at the statistics from, say,  firefights in New York City involving law enforcement,  you know, the number of rounds downrange that mis-target, it's staggering. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, it's amazing.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  Because everything's shutting down, you know?  I mean, you know, it's not nice to have people shooting at you.  Yeah.  I think your sense of survival overrides your sense of training of what you've,  unless you're really trained, you know, then those people can, especially,  you know, you get some of these guys in the military are amazing with kind of  pushing that down.  But an ordinary Joe, when the shit hits the fan,  I don't count how many times you were at the range fucking grouping your shots 
[02:04:30]  right into the target.  Have the target start shooting back.  Let's see how good you are as you're ducked down under the counter.  Exactly.  And if you're 25 yards out or more, then get the fuck out of there.  Yeah.  What are you doing exchanging rounds?  I mean, at that rate.  Serpentine.  Get out of there.  Serpentine.  Yeah, that just seems...  A double barrel.  Of course, you're going to buy one now, aren't you?  This afternoon, you're going to the store and getting one.  I need that.  No, you know what?  I'm really not one for gimmicky weapons.  The most gimmicky one I have is the Desert Eagle, which is, you know, 
[02:05:00]  that's as gimmicky as it gets because it's not practical for any use whatsoever.  But it's just fun to have and makes you chuckle when you shoot it.  Walk into your safe and look at it every now and then.  Yeah, yeah.  Stroke it.  Yeah, you've got to keep it shiny because it's that nice chrome.  So, you know, you want to be able to...  Polish the barrel.  Polish that, clean your guns for no apparent reason.  Haven't even been to the range, but just like the way the oil smells.  Talk to it.  Call it Charlene.  Charlene.  Mine's Lucille. 
[02:05:30]  One of my favorite weapons, Lucille.  Your actions are so good, so clean, Charlene.  Nice and clean.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well.  We have a thing that happened on...  Was it the news?  The happy birthday thing?  Yeah, Jimmy.  It was actually a radio station.  It was on the morning buzz.  The morning buzz.  It was on Big 105 FM in Alberta, Canada.  Calgary.  Wait, Alberta?  Who was the guy that just got fired?  Oh, yeah.  We got to talk about that. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, we didn't talk about him yet.  No.  Do we have the audio?  Yeah, I'm sure we got something.  Do we have the audio of him calling that guy the monkey?  Yeah.  Yeah, we'll find it.  Here's, I guess, Jimmy got wished a happy birthday.  Yes, he did.  I don't want to be stations that wish people birthdays.  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday.  Oh, God.  It's Buzz Birthday.  On the morning buzz.  It's March the 9th.  And little...  I'm going to read this.  Quote, unquote.  Little Jimmy Norton is turning seven today. 
[02:06:30]  And that's exactly how he likes to be called him.  Likes to be called Little Jimmy Norman.  I can't even say his name today.  His birthday for little Jimmy Norton comes from Mom and Dad, Chip, Uncle Paul, Grandpa Sinclair, and Kenny, the slowest dog in the world.  Oh, look at the Eeyore.  Brody Judson is 13 today.  That's...  Who's Ken?  Who's Sinclair?  Peppy.  Oh, Peppy Sinclair.  That's funny.  Peppy Sinclair.  Oh, shit, man. 
[02:07:00]  That is funny.  Very good one.  God, but how awful is that segment?  That's terrible.  Happy birthday!  You added that to have it!  Now, the happy birthday segment, we're thinking of readjusting the clocks and having you do the happy birthday segment at 10 past.  Somebody tells them when to do it.  Oh, yeah.  There's a PD just justifying his job, telling them when they should do the happy birthday segment.  Does anybody listen, like, for that?  I love the happy birthday segment.  Of course. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, you do?  It amazes me that they think people listen.  It was in traffic and then the happy birthday segment.  Yeah, that makes my morning.  You know, my cup of coffee, dude.  I got...  Yeah.  That's ridiculous.  Yeah, this guy was fired.  We were talking about this.  Somebody tweeted the fact that there are a couple of radio guys and they said something that could be deemed racially insensitive.  And that, by the way, is anything that comes out of anyone's mouth in this day and age.  And we were like, oh, God, this guy's so fired. 
[02:08:00]  So totally fired.  And a lot of people were tweeting, I don't think so because...  And then there were just a line of excuses as to why this guy won't be fired.  And I was just saying, no, he's fired.  And lo and behold, he's fired.  Dan Saleo.  Dan Saleo fired over monkey comment.  And no, that wasn't spelt with two E's as far as...  Yes, he band-mouthed the band.  I get what you did there. 
[02:08:30]  That's what I did there.  That was good.  The monkeys.  Ah, banana, my Davy Jones.  Still missing him, huh?  Ah, you know...  We're all feeling the loss.  Yeah.  There we go.  You just don't understand.  Name all four monkeys.  Oh, my God, that would be...  Bill, Ted, Chip, and Pepe.  Here's another opportunity for a firing on the radio.  Anybody want to take a stab at it?  Oh, yeah, yeah, right on the heels of this.  Shut up.  I got my finger on the dump button.  What's this guy do? 
[02:09:00]  I got one more day.  One more day.  This is great.  I got one more day tomorrow.  Sounds like Psycho Park.  What do you mean by that?  Yeah, yeah, one more day.  You mean you have one more...  Here, you can mean one of two things.  One more day.  You mean that you can only have one more day of casting doubts upon the Bucs, like they're  not going to spend money.  I didn't say anything like that.  Or you're meaning that one more day until you get to keep piling on...  I mean, pile on the Bucs even...  Wait a minute.  Be mean.  I have given them the complete benefit of the doubt with the new coaching staff and Butch 
[02:09:30]  and all those guys.  I just can't wait to see.  I can't wait either.  Free agency tomorrow.  I saw Cortland Finnegan.  Apparently, he's trying to get Vincent Jackson to come with him wherever they go.  And the Bucs are like a big candidate.  Man, if they get those two guys and then your boy Jonathan Vilma.  I can't wait, man.  Awesome.  I can't wait either.  You heard it here first.  Finnegan, Vincent Jackson, and Vilma.  Wow.  Wow.  They're going to spend all that money. 
[02:10:00]  And Dan will be like, well, they're not really that good.  No.  No.  If they get those three monkeys, I'm good.  I'm ready, man.  I'm ready.  I want those guys.  They're great players.  Partner, shut up.  Gordon, good morning.  Thanks for coming aboard.  Oh, his partner, shut up.  Hey, Dan.  Real quick note to Tim Tebow.  They should have, by the way, they should have dumped that.  Why didn't they just dump that?  It's one of those things where you probably look at the dump button and like, why didn't  I hit it?  Why am I not pushing the dump button? 
[02:10:30]  Well, how are they all black guys?  Yeah.  You could say Howard Cosell used that term back in the day.  That's a different time.  And back then, it wasn't as high.  People weren't getting fired left and right.  Right.  That's a rough one.  But did you hear that?  You're right.  His partner is just out, right out the door.  Because his partner was gone.  They were having a dialogue back and forth.  And then he's like, yeah, those three monkeys.  And then silence from the partner.  You think the partner looked at him and then the guy was like, uh.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:11:00]  And then went to a phone call.  I've been in this situation enough times to know what the inside is when that happens.  He just slipped.  You look at each other.  You go like, you get a chill up your back and think, oh, shit, I think that was a bad one.  I wonder how I'm going to like Des Moines.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, sleeping in.  Now you start going through the positives.  Sleeping in, you know.  I'm more on a schedule with my friends.  If I have a positive outlook, this change could really be good for me.  Yeah, you know.  I could get back to doing those things I really wanted to do but just didn't have time for. 
[02:11:30]  I'm going to pursue a hobby.  Like, what is he going to do?  Like, you forget that when people get fired, like, it's a story and it's done.  You go away.  But he has to go and find a new job and send out his tape and they're going, what happened?  Well, I was, I'm the monkey guy.  That was me.  Remember me?  Can I just say one thing, though?  America.  Remember we talked about it a little bit ago?  Maybe.  Nobody's going to remember.  But we talked about it.  You know, short-term memory.  You know, everything's immediate.  And then you move on.  Elliot Spitzer.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, look what happened with him. 
[02:12:00]  And then the next thing you know, he's got his own show on some network.  Yeah, that's true.  People are kind of, I don't think, as much forgiving as forgetful.  You're right.  I think people just kind of forget what happened.  The whole moment of it is gone and it's kind of buried for a while.  And then people just don't care anymore.  Well, people are suckers for the truth.  And the truth's on your side, Bubba.  Notice how nobody else is talking.  Yeah.  Truth, son, you're a side, Bubba. 
[02:12:30]  Do you still have that clip up, Danny, anywhere?  Or did you, uh...  You don't recognize that quote?  Well, I can get back to it.  Donald Sutherland.  Do you want to hear it again?  Did he cancel?  Yeah, that's why I'm doing that quote.  He canceled for tomorrow.  He has the flu.  No.  He's coming in next week.  Oh, he will be coming back, though.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But he's not leaving at night because he has the flu.  So we're supposed to get Sutherland tomorrow, which I'm very psyched about.  And, uh...  But he is coming in next week?  People are suckers for the truth.  Truth's on your side, Bubba.  I remember that.  That's a great line.  Yeah, JFK.  Even though that was not one character, that was a combination of a couple of people and 
[02:13:00]  one Purdy and somebody else.  It's a good movie.  It is a good movie.  It's not very realistic, but it's good.  No, but it's entertainment.  It's got that, uh...  Yeah, I mean, it does have those speculative parts in it.  In black and white.  In black and white.  It's got a few speculative parts.  You know, you can speculate, but it made it pretty interesting to go through those different  scenarios and things that might have happened.  Yeah.  Great characters.  Yeah.  You know, people take all that shit too seriously, but if you just...  You know, it's a movie. 
[02:13:30]  Movie's a movie.  And Newman was in it.  I love when people quote it.  Like when people talk about the Kelly's assassination, but I know they're quoting the Oliver Stone movie.  Quote it like it's fact.  Yeah, yeah.  No, it's not.  Oswald never put it in there.  Really?  I got in a discussion about the Bay of Pigs the other day and some guy started talking  to me and he was spouting off information that he picked up from watching The Good Shepherd.  Oh, God.  That's your base of information?  Yeah.  Could you at least maybe watch the History Channel if you have to get your info from TV? 
[02:14:00]  Could you maybe get it from a show that's about it, really?  Truth's on your side, Bubba.  I just wanted to get stuck in people's heads today.  All day.  And it's a great line, but once you start thinking the truth's on your side, Bubba.  I got that happy birthday song, and now I got truth's on your side, Bubba.  But those are my two takeaways from the O&A show.  Hey, Daddy-O.  The man is going to dance on you?  How did John Candy was so good then?  He was like the beatnik almost guy.  And what did he say?  And a good day to you, sir. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  I wish I could remember his dialogue.  He was so good and all fat and greasy.  Oh, yeah.  I think his name was Dean Winters in it.  Wasn't it?  Or Dean something.  How do you remember the names like that?  I don't.  JFK Savant.  I really don't remember him.  I don't remember situations and things and songs.  Jason movies and what the actor did, but their names?  Bah, no idea.  I got a question.  Well, last time I was here, we showed a clip from that ungodly.  The Three Stooges.  Yeah, never mind.  The Three Stooges movie. 
[02:15:00]  Yes.  And did they ever release that?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Yeah.  No, not yet.  And they're still tweaking it?  That's still being shown to focus groups and edited.  Edited.  They're still working.  It didn't look as bad, though.  Remember, we thought it was going to suck.  Oh!  Because it looked like just stooge gags.  It wasn't like they were...  Yeah, but that shit doesn't go over very well now.  For some reason.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  And the music go...  Why didn't they ask you?  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  They should have asked you for that.  Then my manager said to me, do you want to audition? 
[02:15:30]  And I said, I'll fire you.  I don't look like Curly.  You don't want to be Curly?  I don't look like him.  There's a million actors.  There was a comic named Smitty years ago.  He used to do Rascals Open Mic.  I don't know what ever happened to him.  Yeah.  But he looked like Curly.  He was Curly?  Yes.  Big, big guy with fucking crew cut.  He'd always call his wife the missus.  He was a really weird, funny guy.  It's like old school.  Yeah, me and the missus.  But he meant it.  Go home to the missus.  Yeah, the missus.  You know, baking a cake.  Three Stooges slated for 2012. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, April 13th.  April.  It's coming up soon.  Avil.  Well, it is the Farrelly brothers.  Larry Davidson.  It is a nun.  Oh, that's right.  I bet he does well.  Oh, man, I forgot.  Oh, it's going to be a killer.  Who plays the studios?  Nobody's right?  Will Sasso.  Chris.  Mad TV.  Diamantopoulos is Mo.  Will Sasso is Curly.  Sean Hayes is Larry.  They're better off not getting big celebrities.  Nicole Snooki-Polizzi as herself.  Oh, God.  Oh, wow.  That's all you need to know.  Truth's side. 
[02:16:30]  You're a side bubba.  Mike in Situation, Sorrentino as himself.  What?  A little Jersey Shore crossover.  Why would you do that in a movie?  Jennifer Hudson.  This is a strong cast.  It ends up working silly.  You've got to bring the kids in.  Yeah.  After a while, though, like, then the movie, two years later, if it's on, you're like,  uh, not that that's a classic movie without them in it.  Yeah, but once they pop up, you're like, oh, I was tired of those guys.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  I've been hearing some early, early Oscar buzz.  Yeah.  Three Stooges. 
[02:17:00]  Do you ever date a girl who said she loved the Three Stooges?  Do you ever have a girl who said, because I, they never, yeah, they never do, once they  get married to you, they, you know, they hate them, and they do, but I think girls are  told, you know, if you really want to get to the guy, tell him you like the Three Stooges  and you like baseball, and you're like, wow, she's perfect, man, she's hot, likes the  Stooges.  No.  Women don't like slapstick, those dummies.  They don't like slapstick at all.  They don't appreciate it.  They're usually on the receiving end of it.  Call my sinners.  You.  That's true. 
[02:17:30]  You're getting a moe fucking frying pan over the head.  Dude, they don't understand the beauty of Shemp getting a fucking broom driven into  his face.  It's like, do you understand how great that is?  Yeah.  The two by four swinging and hitting both of them.  That's a good one.  That was fantastic.  It's funny every time.  But it's a male gender thing, and I tell you, I know this because I got these three  old boys all in the age of five, and the four and a half year old and the two and a half  year old, not too long ago, I came downstairs because the two and a half year old was screaming, 
[02:18:00]  and I said, well, what the fuck's going on?  And the four and a half year old Scooter was over in the corner, and he was just laughing  his ass off.  I couldn't even get him to focus to say, what's wrong?  What happened?  What happened to Sluggo?  And I'm looking at him, and my wife comes down, and she's saying, so anyway, we're interrogating  him.  It's been about a minute.  We finally realized what's happened is the four and a half year old had reached into the  fishbowl, pulled out a goldfish, and stuffed it down Sluggo's diaper.  So he's now got a fish down his pants.  That means, what that means is the four and a half year old instinctively understood that 
[02:18:30]  fish down the pants was funny, as a thing, right?  And my wife didn't get it.  She was chastising, well, you know, this fish could have died.  And you can imagine the horror of the fish being stuck in there with my two and a half  year old's unit.  So with the fish left, happy ending.  But I guess my point being is, it's a male thing.  The boys instinctively understood it was funny.  Well, a woman would never do that, just because they figured that, you know, it's redundant. 
[02:19:00]  Don't even.  Oh, stop it.  You know, that's where I draw the line with your show.  Yeah, you're really going to do that.  You're going to start alienating the ladies.  That is, though, but guys do find that really funny.  And it's just, like you said, it's instinctive.  It's inbred in our genes.  There was one scene I saw recently where I guess they were in a mine and they got all  the mining tools. 
[02:19:30]  And you know when the mining tools come in that something hilarious is afoot.  And one of them, I think it might have been Curly had the pick.  And he swings back and hooks, I guess, Larry's suspenders.  And instead of looking to see what it's hooked on, turning around, unhooking it and getting  back to work, he just starts pulling very hard and stretching Larry's suspenders out  until he loses the grip on the pick, which then is rocketed toward Larry's head, making 
[02:20:00]  a giant clang, which would have killed any man.  Killed!  So if you can't get to the theater, make sure to get your film on tape where you describe  the movie.  Describe it.  His head should have been split open and he would have been instantly killed.  But he just goes, hey, watch what you're doing over there.  Hey, you, I'm warning you.  Just have a fucking, like a pick, just ricochet back into your forehead. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Keep playing a little Stooges, Danny, just for a second.  The one where anytime there's tools to be used, when they were doing carpentry and Curly  did something stupid and Moe grabbed a handsaw and he goes, stick your tongue out.  And he stuck his tongue out and he just runs, he takes his thumb so he gets a straight line,  puts his thumb on Curly's tongue, and then runs the saw blade down the middle of his  tongue.  And you hear the sound like, ah, ah, ah, it's fantastic. 
[02:21:00]  It really was just such brutal, harsh punishment for little infractions.  Terrible.  With those infractions built up.  So he deserved every one of them.  I love Shemp.  A lot of people didn't like Shemp was great.  Shemp was really funny, yeah.  Yeah, Shemp is an acquired taste.  People liked Curly more.  Curly Joe stunk.  Curly Joe Besser, I hate him.  It was hateable.  Yeah, that was the later one.  Yeah, yeah, that was the later ones.  Was he 39 when he died?  How old was Curly when he died?  Curly?  I thought he was older, but I mean, you know, quite a fat fuck. 
[02:21:30]  Why, I haven't heard that word for years.  You know, bub, I was once a tramp like you.  Oh, congratulations.  Ah, but it wasn't always thus.  I can look back to the days of y'all when I was a very happy married man.  And one day that rat came and destroyed forever all the happiness of that.  It's like a dickhead on his head.  I'll never forget that day.  I just came home from the graveyard shift.  Yeah.  There was a note on a pillow.  What did it say?  Well, it was one of those cold-blooded notes.  Oh, this is like them doing dialogue. 
[02:22:00]  Get one of them hitting each other.  I want to see them hitting each other.  We got the one clip of them talking.  What?  I put in, like, the best of Stooges, thinking that it would be nothing but, like, the best physical getting hit in the face.  No, it's the slowly-eyed chair.  There we go.  There's some smack in the face.  Oh, man.  They were pretty good, like, stuntmen.  Amazing.  Excuse me, kid.  It didn't look like they were pulling punches.  You know, I'll cut my losses and I'll click on... 
[02:22:30]  And then lap smacks and pokes.  Yeah.  Larry had a callus on his face from getting slapped so many times.  Larry's fine.  No way.  Yes, he did.  Wrestlers get cauliflower ear from wrestling.  He'd been...  For years he did this, yeah.  He didn't do it.  And you did.  It's just...  Get out.  Oh, my neck.  It's...  They're just smacking each other.  I know this is terrible on the radio.  Just smacking.  Fuck him.  It's all face.  Get their own monitors. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  Oh, broom to the fucking head.  Every time.  Can you try it a little bit, Danny?  That's good.  That's good.  How did this pitch go?  We got three guys who just beat each other up.  It's just all fucking face slaps.  I like the...  Oh.  I like the two fingers in the eyes.  That's a classic.  You can't poke my eye, poking fingers.  Good.  Now you can't poke it in the eye. 
[02:23:30]  He's poking them in the eye really hard.  How do they do that?  How do they...  Really hard.  Wow.  I'm so...  Oh.  I remember they used to present this with a guy called Officer Joe Bolton in New York  on one of the local stations.  And he used to do a little warning beforehand.  Now, kids, remember, don't do what you see the three stooges doing.  You could hurt your playmate or brother and sister.  Because I think kids were taking their two fingers. 
[02:24:00]  That was the one with the pick.  Taking their two fingers and driving them into their friend's eyeballs.  He was the one face.  You get him to...  He has fives.  He has fives.  He smacks them in the face.  This could be the greatest fucking YouTube clip ever.  It's only them hitting each other.  No storyline, no nothing.  You got to tell people where to go for this. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, yeah.  What is it?  YouTube?  And slap, smack, some pokes on you.  Slap, smack, and pokes.  It's only got 82,000.  It's the best clip ever.  Who the fuck?  Pete, how do you not like this?  I don't know.  Here's the thing.  This is what I should say.  If you have a vagina, you will hate this clip.  Porcupine.  And the Foley guys had to be amazing on this, too.  Oh, my God, yeah.  You had to find the sound of bopping someone in the head with your fist.  Lead pipes. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, that's Curly Besser.  He stunk.  Joe Besser stunk.  Not so hard.  I'll give you such a pinch.  Would he say that?  Yeah.  That's not a joke.  What a hammer.  Hammer on the head.  Oh, I have the horse kicking him in the face.  Kicked in the face by a horse.  It's just back kicking them both in the face.  See, he'd go like, yeah.  I think he was supposed to be a little effeminate. 
[02:25:30]  Was that him?  Yeah.  That was Joe Besser.  You're the anesthetist.  Don't call me names.  You okay?  Yeah.  Who thought that would work?  Who thought?  He was awful.  Boy, they're showing a lot of the ones with him.  Yeah, get rid of him.  He's like a weird character.  He's like Hitchcock.  Yeah.  Oh, look what you did.  You are, I want to give you the hot face. 
[02:26:00]  That's what I want to do.  The what?  I don't know.  I don't like him.  I've been spending too much time with him.  I know.  Too much time with Joe Besser.  Boo.  It's almost like they did it in like chronological order.  Yeah, yeah.  Boo.  Yeah.  It's the word chronological.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  These are the last few where it's like they were real wrinkled and they were just concerned  they were going to really hurt each other after a while.  Oh!  Yeah, they'd show him in New York and they actually got, I remember as a kid, they actually 
[02:26:30]  got Moe Howard to do a promo for Officer Joe Bolton's Three Stooges show that would  come on on Channel 11 here in New York or Channel 9, one of the two.  And they got Moe to do a promo and all he said was like, you're watching the Three Stooges  on WPIX and he was so fucking old that as a kid it freaked me out because I'm watching  him for years and years as, you know, that energetic guy that's the one pretty much in 
[02:27:00]  charge beating up the other guys and there he was just all his gray Moe haircut.  Was he making money by all the kids could come up and smack him?  Yeah.  Five bucks a snack?  Yeah, at an appearance you just smack him and there was Officer Joe Bolton.  But you could show that, you could show that slaps, smacks and pokes clip to a room full  of women and it'd be crickets.  They would look at it the way we watch The View. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah.  Just hating it.  Yeah, not understanding it and hating it.  They wouldn't giggle or fucking howl at the, they, because they don't understand because  they're too busy making biscuits.  They don't understand how great a fucking wrench to the forehead is.  Wrecking, making biscuits?  Yeah.  Do you know what a wrench to the forehead is?  Oh, put these, let me hear this.  That was, uh.  On the Magic Garden, bitches.  Magic Garden.  This is, yeah, this is just like a huge compilation of, uh. 
[02:28:00]  Can we hear that song, the Magic Garden song?  Channel 11 here in New York City.  Yay!  Oh, and the one girl would skip and.  I don't remember her.  Skip behind the long show.  I want to hear the Magic Garden song, though.  Oh, find the Magic Garden.  Didn't it go like, this is the Magic Garden.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Oh, here's the opening theme.  Would she skip?  Was, was one of the chicks hot and one looked like a dyke?  Yeah.  I had a crush on one of these girls.  Yeah, yeah.  Which one?  Oh, man.  The Magic Garden, get it? 
[02:28:30]  Sing a song.  It's where the bush is.  Right?  Lesbian.  One big happy family.  Oh.  Who'd you like?  Oh, the one on the right.  The one on the left.  It must have been the one on the right.  Yeah.  The one on the right was the cute one.  The one on the left is balding.  Jesus.  The one on the left looks like a skinny mama Cass.  A big oval head.  She looks like Tom Petty.  Yeah.  Yeah, the other one was hot.  This is folksy shit. 
[02:29:00]  What happened in the Magic Garden?  I don't know.  They would tell stories.  Would they?  Oh, man.  They had a box with costumes and they would reenact stories.  She's the awful one.  Oh, wait a big.  What's happening?  Birds playing tricks and a magic tree grows lollipops things.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  We know what that means.  They're playing patty cakes, sitting on mushrooms.  Yeah.  Oh, they're sitting on mushrooms.  Pulling costumes out of their box.  Cock-a-doodle-doo.  Cock-a-doodle-doo.  Get it?  And clap your hands and stamp your shoes. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, that's great stuff.  Wow.  This is...  Flowers coming out.  So you used to watch this.  Yeah, a lot.  Jimmy, you did?  77.  I was nine.  I was a boy.  Aw.  What did I know?  I was smoking pot.  She grew in the Magic Garden.  Yeah.  What happened to these girls?  Are they dead?  Hope so.  We should find out where they are.  Get them on the show.  I'd love to recreate this moment.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sit them on a swing.  Find out what happened to the girls from the Magic Garden. 
[02:30:00]  You sit them on a swing and then drive a truck right into them.  By the way, this right now, this is what information is, how fast it is.  Like, we want to know immediately.  Right.  We can watch them, hear the song, and find out if they're alive or dead.  You would have to go to, like, the television, the Museum of Broadcasting.  Yes.  And hope you could pull up a clip from that.  I went to one of these concerts as a little kid at the Nassau Coliseum.  The Magic Garden ladies did big gigs?  Yeah.  Oh, really?  No.  How was it?  That was, like, four or five. 
[02:30:30]  But I just remember all the kids' clothes were pink and orange because they had a squirrel  and some other little puppet animal that would come into the Magic Garden.  Are you sure you didn't just dream this last night?  No, no.  He's our little fat boy.  A rung, rung, rung, rung, rung, rung.  They had flowers that would laugh called the Chuckle Patch.  Oh, yeah.  The Chuckle Patch sucked.  Fucking gross.  What the hell is that?  Well, apparently they still promote this shit.  What?  Yeah.  Are they still doing something?  There was some, like, retrospective on PIX, and they just put it. 
[02:31:00]  There was a DVD that contained 10 episodes released in 08, and they still go around doing  public appearances and live children shows under the title Carol and Paula, Friends Forever.  I guess they can't do Magic Garden.  Post means shit without pictures.  I want to see pictures of them.  Of them?  Of them.  Yeah.  Let's see if you can find a picture of the Chuckle Patch, too.  What now?  Yeah.  Carol and Paula.  There you go.  Fucking go down on your Chuckle.  Oh, no.  There you go.  Whoa.  Oh, man.  They don't look as bad as I would have thought 40 years later. 
[02:31:30]  Ram, ram.  35 years later, dude.  Which one's which?  Yeah, which one's fucking which?  Yeah, the big toothy one.  The one's got big, annoying teeth.  Big, giant teeth.  Guys, we are in for a fucking treat.  Why?  Because I think we could check these guys out if we want.  Are they hookers now?  All right.  Updated 3-12-12.  That's like the other day.  That was the hot one, I think.  I can't remember.  Carol Demas.  Yeah, I think.  I think it was the hot one.  I think it was the fucking worst.  Oh, here we go.  Tuesday, March 13th. 
[02:32:00]  Bronx, New York.  Oh, boy.  It was yesterday.  April 1st, Bayshore.  Carol and Paula celebrate the Magic Garden.  40th birthday.  Wow.  This is it.  The big 4-0.  It's Kismas.  Let's go there in heckle.  In Bayshore.  Let's have a show in Long Island?  Yeah.  Let's go.  That's right by you.  Let's go in Bo.  Bo!  This show sucks.  Fuck you.  Show us your tit.  Tinker, Taylor, soldier whores.  This is all nonsense.  Oh, my God.  Look, time. 
[02:32:30]  That time.  What songs did they sing?  Oh, God.  I want to go see the Magic Garden.  I'm sure they opened with a theme song to the Magic Garden.  Is that the hot one?  I can't tell.  There was never a hot one.  No, that one was kind of hot.  There was one that was more attractive than the other.  Do you think they're a couple?  The better one.  Just call it the better one.  The better one.  The less offensive one.  Are they married or no?  Oh, boy.  To each other or other people?  What are you implying?  I mean, other people.  Yeah, it did say that one of them was married with some kids.  Oh, okay. 
[02:33:00]  To a cuck.  Yeah, cuckold.  He likes his wife to sit on a swing.  Sit on another mushroom.  They're available for special events.  Fundraisers, concerts, private parties.  Forty fucking years later, and they're still milking this Magic Garden thing.  You can get them for it.  Private parties.  You just have them come over to your house, and nobody else is there.  I should.  Just you.  While you're sitting there clanking.  Just jacking it.  Oh, God.  All you have to do is just email them, and you could probably get a quote.  I could probably get a quote, yeah.  I mean, maybe for the next compound party. 
[02:33:30]  I'm going to guess five Gs.  You could email them from their webpage.  Say, I'm having a party at my house.  It's a pool party.  Do you know what, dude?  That would be great to get the Magic Garden.  Oh, yeah.  The Magic would probably all have a good time and clap and shit.  Oh, everyone's drinking and fucking naked in the pool.  And they are, too.  They are, too.  They're fucking...  They love giving oral.  Yeah.  They bring the Magic Swing with a hole drilled in the bottom.  You could do amyl nitrate through it and blow your friend. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, shit.  Wow, Al.  Look at that.  Instant information there.  Oh, lovely.  Wow.  Oh, that's...  That's a whole series of photos.  Yeah.  Where are the old pictures?  Oh, there's two old pictures of her up top.  How much to get these gals at the...  Let's email them.  Say, yo, we're looking to throw a party.  Bunch of men.  We're going to ask you to wear cracker costumes.  You stand in a circle and play your little songs.  You know, I remember when I was a kid watching you and...  Yeah.  Yeah, I got my first heart on. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, I sent a creepy, trying-to-be-friendly email.  And I would get such a tent in my pants, LOL.  How much?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Should be a bunch of men standing around.  We had to book them for a party and then send them to, like, 150th and Malcolm X Boulevard.  Playing that shite music that they play.  Which one is standing in the corner?  There'll be a bunch of guys drinking Old English.  Eisenhower Park.  They're all over Long Island.  Port Jeff.  What the fuck is going on?  They sell out.  The Magic Gardens are all over Long Island. 
[02:35:00]  How much are they?  I don't know how much they ought to get.  Admission.  Free.  No, a few Gs, I bet you.  It can't be that much.  How about your 5Gs?  A few thousand, yeah.  I wouldn't even think that much.  No fucking way.  They probably do it for, like, a grand each.  Yeah, that's probably more like it.  Two grand.  Who's going to pay more for them?  Play some shitty 70s folk songs?  Exactly.  I would love to hear those folk songs.  It's memorabilia.  It's walk down memory lane.  Yeah.  It's nostalgia.  It's bringing back your childhood.  Who wouldn't pay a lot of money to bring back you?  Never mind.  It falls into a weird category of nostalgia. 
[02:35:30]  Like, as you got older, you're not going to want to hear stupid, folky kid songs.  Yeah.  I want to hire fucking Alan Alda to come over and just do caulk-eye lines in my apartment.  Is that what you're thinking?  Caulk-eye.  Caulk-eye.  Yes.  Caulk-eye.  That's when a doctor fixes your job.  Caulk-eye.  Oh, Jimmy.  Yeah, they're available with the original cast of Grease. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, that's...  Ew.  Oh, Carol is starring on Broadway.  That happened.  We missed that, folks.  What part did she play?  I bet you she played Rizzo.  She was Rizzo.  Sandy.  What?  Yeah.  How old is she?  She can't play Sandy.  It's a different version of Grease.  So they meet in an old-age home, and Danny Zuko breaks his hip, and Sandy nurses him back  to health, and then Craterface puts a finger on Danny Zuko's bottom.  Stranded on the toilet, branded a fool. 
[02:36:30]  Tell me more, tell me more, like, did he have diabetes?  Oh, shit.  It's Grease Lightning.  It's about a walker or a wheelchair.  Diuretic.  It's got rubber grips and tennis balls on the feet.  Grease Lightning, go, Grease Lightning.  It's got a little thing for you to hang your piss bag off of. 
[02:37:00]  Summer Lovin' is about an orally molestia.  I had a pillow put over my face.  Oh, shit.  Smelled cocoa butter.  All over the place.  At the home.  Yes. 
[02:37:30]  I wish I'd seen this movie, so I'd have more fun.  I got nothing.  I never saw the movie.  I never saw Grease.  Yeah, I got it.  Or at the last song, they're bombin' the bomb.  I got cancer cells.  They're multiplying.  And I'm looosin' lots of weight.  And they're divided.  And that would've been a good one.  And the chemo you're supplying.  And my bladder's lost control.  My piss is electrified. 
[02:38:00]  Why is it so long?  And too bad you can't stand up.  Ow, ow, ow.  Ah, shit.  Yeah, that's great.  Picking out tombstones.  You're the one that I want.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  That was a fun one.  Yeah.  I wish I could remember more of the songs.  I know.  I should really be looking down at this. 
[02:38:30]  Right.  We go together.  How did we go together go?  We go together.  Like, sham-a-lam-a-lam-a.  Yeah, a bunch of noise.  Oh, good.  His iPod is available.  Yeah, da-da-da-da-da.  Yeah, da-da-da-da-da.  Oh, you're right.  I hate that part.  Who would?  See, like, when I'm flippin' through the channels and this is on, it's instant off. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Instant.  Why don't you watch it?  I will say, though, that what was Sandy's song that was really good when she sang Alone?  I'm sorry.  Hopelessly Devoted to You?  That's a good song.  Hopelessly Devoted.  That was a huge hit.  It was.  It's a good tune.  And what year was that a hit?  78.  78.  78, kids.  Yeah, that was a while ago.  It's a good tune.  Oof.  Yeah.  Hopelessly Devoted.  I want to say what she's singing to right now, but I won't. 
[02:39:30]  I feel like I could just remove my penis and leave it at the door and turn in my card.  But you, boom, boom, I used to have to.  Same thing could apply to You're the One That I Want.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:40:00]  Wait for you.  Yeah.  What a big hit.  Yeah.  See, a lot of places, what I love about this show is a lot of places would have just played about five seconds of that.  Oh, no, we keep going.  But we just let it go.  And for the trifecta, we could also do We Go Together.  Yeah, yeah.  Since we're still on that.  I'm looking at the songs.  Let me say.  Yeah, let me.  Born to Hand Jive.  Oh, God.  There's the original song, Grease, from the opening. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, I forgot that one.  Why don't you play that?  Frankie Valli, right?  I'm getting upset.  I'm getting upset.  Where's it, Avalon?  Frankie Avalon.  That beauty school dropout?  Who didn't like that one?  Oh, yeah.  It's a poor kid in the first beauty school.  Fucking worthless.  She just killed herself.  Yeah.  Frenchie.  This is during a prostate exam.  Grease is the word.  Is this still a Lemmy Newton-John singing? 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  After the hormones.  It's a good soundtrack.  Fuck.  Boy.  I wish I could think of more wacky, zany song parodies, but now we're just playing the goddamn  songs.  Yeah, I know.  I'm about to go home and drink heavily.  Yeah.  And watch that slap smacks and pokes again.  I'm genuinely enjoying this.  Are you really?  Jimmy's a weird guy. 
[02:41:30]  I like this.  Jimmy's a weird guy when it comes to music.  You're like Sabbath.  And then you could listen to this.  Dun, dun, dun, dun.  That would be good.  Sabbath does the soundtrack for Grease.  Grease.  Jimmy's in his glory right there.  Jimmy's in his fucking glory.  Yeah.  Look at me.  I'm Sandra Dee.  Ozzy could do, uh, we go together.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:42:00]  Can we just please turn this off?  Yeah, yeah.  We can turn off Iraq.  Who's got control of this right now?  Iraq was digging it.  I was digging it.  Reminding of his Florida days.  Yeah.  Right?  He was a greaser and he would fight with the Sochers.  Oh, yeah.  And he had some Sochers crackers and he would eat those.  Maybe we can play the soundtrack now from Grease 2.  Could we go to that?  Oh, yeah.  Great.  I guess, oh, we got into that because the Magic Garden Girl was doing Sandy's role.  What the?  But she was, it was when she's old?  Like, recently she did that?  Yeah.  They were bringing the original cast. 
[02:42:30]  They had, like, Barry Boswick playing Danny Zuko.  Oh, jeez.  Wow.  And I think, what the fuck?  Yeah, the original.  Wilford Brimley.  That's good.  I got the diabetes.  Walter Bobby.  If you've got a bun in the oven, well, you can do things about it.  I hope you don't just feel sorry for yourself.  Get an abortion.  And, of course, Jeff Conaway not doing well.  Yes, the dead Jeff Conaway.  Yes.  What part did he play?  He was a...  Kenickie.  Kenickie.  Get a hickey from Kenickie. 
[02:43:00]  Good God.  Get a hickey from Kenickie.  I just want...  People should know you pulled that out without looking at anything.  Oh, yeah.  You didn't do any research.  That's what a Kenickie hickey in the old age home is just some angry orderly biting your chest.  Oh, my God.  What's up?  320-pound orderly?  Yeah, all your kick and your little white shoes fall off.  This old bag is walking around saying she got a hickey from Kenickie and it's just sarcoma.  Bed sores all over. 
[02:43:30]  Really?  Did he give you hickeys only on one side of your body, Ethel?  Again, you're a liar.  Here comes the orderly to slip your grease lightning.  Oh, God.  Grease lightning.  Oh, grease lightning's coming again.  Shut up or you get the pillow.  It's not even a nice grease lightning.  It's literally just cooking lard.  It's not the good grease is what he's saying. 
[02:44:00]  No, no.  It's not the good grease.  Not that good grease.  Well, congratulations to her.  She still seems to be eking a career out as Long Island based as it may be.  We should get her on the show.  Oh, man.  Roland will come in.  I think I could get her.  We just have to take the people from the electric company first.  Yeah, that's what it would be.  Yeah.  Other people.  Could you take the count first?  Yeah, we need to. 
[02:44:30]  He's going to count on the show and then we might get the electric company.  But you've got to take the second O in Zoom.  Yeah, yeah.  Zoom.  Zoom people.  You've got to take the girl from Zoom that used to talk to the weird talk.  Who was the weird talk?  I don't know.  Habba Bubba Wobby Bubby.  Ew.  Who remembers her?  I don't know.  And then they did that thing with their arms.  I don't remember Zoom.  I just remember the theme song ruled.  We're going to Zoom, Zoom, Zoom.  Yeah, I know that.  We're going to Zoom, Zoom, Zoom.  No?  Yeah, I missed all that shit. 
[02:45:00]  I missed all that shit.  And the address.  Write Zoom Z-O-O-M, Box 350, Boston, Mass 02134.  Tell it what it was.  Yeah.  What was this?  Was this like the same time as the Banana Splits and Fraggle Rock and all that?  Yeah, Fraggle Rock.  Fraggle Rock of the 80s.  Oh, okay.  Zoom.  Turn us up, Danny.  Or something.  Oh, man.  They're hippie kids.  Weren't they Canadian?  All right.  Now your job is to find out where these kids are now.  Oh, man.  Drugs, drugs, drugs, prostitution, drugs. 
[02:45:30]  And running a tech company.  This show sucks.  Oh, what's she doing?  Yeah.  What the fuck is she?  Oh, she's not dancing.  Ew, mora.  What the fuck?  What a mess.  Hey, Luis.  Luis does a little Spanish dance.  Luis probably got sick a bunch of years later and didn't know what it was.  Oh, so did David.  Oh, boy.  There's Bernadette.  That's the one that does the arms.  My name's Jake.  Oh, he's wacky.

They all had cool stripes like Waldo shirts.  Yeah.  See that?  The slap.  Dear Zoom.  Dear Zoom.  Oh, this song is terrible.  This is going to be stuck in everyone's house.  Oh, I hope so.  Oh, man.  The truth on your side, Bubba.  Zoom's on your side, Bubba. 
[02:46:30]  Enough with your Zooming.  I know.  Who wrote this?  If any of the Zoom kids, original Zoom kids are listening, please call.  Yes.  Yeah.  And if not, Danny, maybe you can see what happened to some of the Zoom kids.  Yeah.  Well, this says here, season two, cast two.  Particularly find the tragic stories.

Looks like a fucking aborigin.  Is that his biggest teeth?  Or is he putting fake teeth in?  That's how it is.  Yeah, he just looks like some college bum.  Although, look, you see, he's got the same teeth.  He chews gravel for a living.  Hey, I've got to warm down.  All right, and what?  David's mom, Mary, worked at the WSB and still does.  That's a terrible fact.  Oh, here's Jared.  Oh, boy.  Uh-oh. 
[02:48:00]  Jared.  Jared's wearing it.  Oh, he's with a girl.  It looks like his mom.  Probably a friend.  Yeah, could be his mom.  Looks like a thin Dane cook.  Oh, yeah.  What year was the Zoom update?  2011.  The video was posted in 2010.  How'd they get them all?  I think it was all like MySpace.  What else are they doing?  Oh, it's their MySpace.  Oh, shit.  Jared passed away in a car accident.  Fast Jared fact.  Oh, boy.  That was a terrible Jared fact.  December 28th, 2006.  Oh, man.  Age of 21. 
[02:48:30]  And he was called Fast Jared?  Wow, that's ironic.  Wow, he died in a car wreck.  Oh, he was Zooming down the street.  Yeah.  Oh, geez.  That's terrible.  We're going to boom, boom, boom, boom.  Kiko.  I hope Kiko's doing okay.  We're going to.  Fast fact.  Kiko works in a massage parlor.  Yeah.  Happy ending.  Yes.

Zodie is what we know called a three-hauler.  Holy shit. 
[02:50:00]  Zoe looked like she was going to be a dud.  Zoe was a school girl.  That's Zoe Fax.  She turned out pretty good.  Holding money, too?  Uh-oh.  Oh, yes.  She probably had a boob job.  Whoa.  Nice.  That's a little risque.  I like that.  Oh, the season two ones.  That's the ones we just saw.  Yeah.  Caroline.  Caroline.  We're having a Caroline.  Oh, boy.  Oh, wait.

Eric.  He's a young black guy, very light-skinned, I think.  Right.  Yeah.  He has an Obama chin almost.  Oh.  He got even lighter.  Yeah. 
[02:52:00]  How'd that happen?  He's looking.  Condition.  Very biracial.  He's probably modeling.  Doing a little modeling, I'd say.  Is that what you're saying is that?  Attempting to.  Fast.  Well, it appears to be.  Yeah, it looks like that.  He's attempting to model.  But so far, it's not made the only way.  There's no fast facts on these kids.  No fast facts on him.  Francis.  They really went with an African cast there in the third season.  She looks like she's just at her webcam.  Yep.  Right before she pulls her tits out.  She's very chesty.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  Francis is busty.  There she is.  Not much makeup on.  With a big forehead. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  Young lady.  This video sucks.  Yeah, it does.  Come on.  I wanted the update.  It's all 30.  I love to see these kids doing this smack, smacks, and pokes video.  Where they all just smack each other.  The Zoom kids beating the shit out of each other.  All right.  Who says?  She can take a loan on that face.  Kaylee.  Kaylee's love.  Kaylee turned out okay.  And she looked a little.  Oh.  And look.  Her boyfriend's got a matching tie to go with her gown.  Rachel.  Rachel.  Rachel.  She's got a little African child.  She's that cute.  Yeah.  She's kind of. 
[02:53:00]  She's a Whitney Houston face almost.  She's like a boy though, I think.  Well, you know.  Kind of as a man face.  Well, why don't you stop being so rude?  Maybe she's a nice girl with an extra gift.  Okay.  I didn't know.  Yeah.  Maybe she's a very chesty girl.  Her and Francis are cousins.  They're in the fast frames of fact.  It's a nice one.  Season four.  Good God.  How long did it go on?  I know.  How many fucking seasons have I been there?  I want to bet.  Aileen is wearing a little upside down.  Lettuce on her head.  There's a fast viewer fact.  There's 32 Zoomers.  So this is going to go on for the next half hour. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  This is stupid.  I don't care.  We can turn this off.  I have to pee badly.  Yeah.  Fuck this.  Let's take a break.  Get away from these goddamn.  Apologize, folks.  We get off on a Zoom tangent as one will from time to time.  Yeah.  And it all started with you walking down Magic Garden Lane.  Yeah.  See what happens?  That's what this show is, though.  We got ourselves in trouble.  Yeah.  It just kind of meanders.  Yeah.  It was starting in Iran.  We like that.  We ended up with a chuckle patch.  Hey, who's that?  Who is that bitch?  Go back that up.  Is that, uh, that's that kid?  Wow.  You know, these girls turned out pretty attractive. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  Those goofy bras.  They always pull through.  Goofy bras.  They always pull through.  Oh, yeah.  Look at the little midriff show.  Yeah.  Why you want?  Oh, I don't go for that.  Oh, she's crazy hanging her tongue out.  What is she, devil girl?  Are they all Canadian?  No, I think they are.  I don't know.  Uh-oh.  This show was way before me.  Is that a guy and then the later one was a girl?  Nah, it was just fucking fake.  Yeah, fast fact.  Let's see.  I get it.  Yeah, okay.  Nah, it's not good.  All right.  We'll take a break.  We'll be right back.  The O.P. 
[02:54:30]  Anthony Channel.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  On SiriusXM.  It's almost time to go home.  It's almost time to go home.  It's almost time to go home.  It's almost time to go home. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, any reason for this, E-Rock?  Just because it's fun. 
[02:55:30]  He was in here yesterday.  What?  CeeLo?  Yep.  CeeLo, motherfucker, was in this motherfucker?  That's right.  Was he across the hall?  I don't know if he did.  He probably was.  I don't think he did out.  I know he did Hits 1.  Yeah?  Hits 1?  How tall is he?  CeeLo?  I didn't see him.  You didn't see CeeLo?  Mm-mm.  Would have liked to.  Cino?  That's right.  That was what happened with me. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Wow, okay.  He was in here.  A lot of the big stars come wandering through this place.  That's right.  Biggest celebrity you've seen in the hallways of Sirius XM Satellite Radio?  It has to be Lady Gaga.  I thought you were going to say Anthony Cummings.  Second, you're not bigger than Lady Gaga.  You're bigger than Oprah, but not Lady Gaga.  Oh, wow.  So the Gog?  I think so.  Did you get a picture?  No, no, no.  Hell no.  Jim did, but...  Jim got a picture with Lady Gog.  Jim just walked in doing his model face. 
[02:56:30]  Jennifer Lopez was pretty impressive.  Do you remember when she was in...  J-Lo.  Oh, well, how could we forget?  I mean...  That was Mars.  Bam!  It was pretty impressive.  I was prepared for that to be overblown.  Like, ah, she's not going to look that good.  But then when she walked by, man, it was fucking ridiculous.  It was really ridiculous.  There's just something about, like, famous people.  Like, who did you see at a restaurant out there in L.A.?  When I was in L.A., I saw Charlize Theron.  Charlize.  She's very pretty. 
[02:57:00]  Very attractive girl.  Yeah.  She must bring a cologne on.  Yes, I'm going to a meeting.  I was trying to see what kind of cologne that is.  High karate.  Very good, huh?  Tire d'Hermes.  D'Hermes.  Or, I don't know.  It looks French.  You know what?  What do I know?  I throw on some polo, some brute.  What the heck?  What do I know?  I call this perfume the Magic Garden perfume.  Oh.  Smells like a Magic Garden.  Lady Gaga had an amazing...  She had a cool vibe to her, though.  Like, she is...  There's people that you've met like that that have a vibe to them. 
[02:57:30]  Like, she has a superstar fucking energy.  Yeah.  When she walks, it's just there's a weird energy because all these people are walking with her.  Big celebrities look different.  Yep.  They just have a look about them.  Like, you could see a really pretty girl, and they're a pretty girl.  But then you see someone like Charlize Theron, and she's pretty, but then there's this extra  little thing that's like, oh, that's Hollywood.  It's like the impeccable hair and makeup and clothing and the way they walk around. 
[02:58:00]  It's untouchable, unless you're another celebrity.  It's untouchable.  Yeah, yeah.  They just have this different look about them.  Al McPherson was up here yesterday, too.  How's she look?  She's getting a little long in the tube.  Yeah, a little long in the tube.  I hate to say that, but, you know.  She's still a supermodel, but she's a little...  Yeah.  She's not modeling anymore.  Supermodel.  My big brush with fame was I got on a hotel elevator in Los Angeles a little while back,  and I'm on there.  Nobody else is on there, and I'm staring at my BlackBerry. 
[02:58:30]  Someone else walks on just before the doors close.  And I kind of look, and it's a skirt.  It's a skirt.  It's a skirt.  It's some skirt.  And so I look up, and this was my big moment, my big opportunity.  And this was all I had.  I looked at her, and I said, hey, you're Scarlett Johansson.  Oh.  Yeah.  And that was the only thing I could think to say, was to point out to her, in case she  was confused, who she was.  Well, you could have brought up the fact that, say, hey, I heard you had sex in an elevator. 
[02:59:00]  And then she would have said, yes.  And then, you know, hey, would you like to again?  Something like that.  Well, you know, funny enough, it's almost like you were there, because that's exactly how  the dialogue went after I blew the opening line.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It all just, from there, it just was, it was incredible.  In fact, I think there's some YouTube footage of it.  She was, she was alone in there?  She was alone in there.  And I, and I, so I look at her, and I, and that's when I delivered the famous line.  Hey, you're, you're Scarlett Johansson.  And she looks at me, and she goes, yes, I am.  And so I went back to my Blackberry. 
[02:59:30]  It was pathetic.  It was so pathetic.  Oh, man.  I know.  I complete blown chance.  You fucked her?  Well, yeah, but you know, it was, that, you know, it was so pathetic.  That is sad.  She didn't go, yeah, you're Mike Baker.  Yeah.  Well, I think she wanted to, but she was nervous, you know, because.  People do get a little nervous around you.  It's that celebrity thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just, I just recently saw her at the Springsteen show, Scar Jo, Scarlett Johansson.  Didn't you also see her at the Radiohead show? 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, we, we run into each other a lot.  Wow.  When you're running in similar circles.  Wow.  That's.  Whoa.  Whoa.  You just bumped into.  Scarlett Johansson.  Whoa.  Yes.  That's, you know, I see her, you give that, you know what it is?  And it's the cool thing to do.  So you don't even make it like you're acknowledging each other.  Just pass by.  Don't give the head bob.  Don't give a wave.  Don't say hi.  That's how you know she doesn't acknowledge you.  And you're like, yep.  That's the cool way.  Gotcha. 
[03:00:30]  Because people that say, hey, you're Scarlett Johansson, they just look silly.  Yeah.  That's right.  That's right.  What?  You should say hi.  No, no.  We, we save our highs for our private.  Like while you were fanboying Ben Stiller with your girl.  Yeah.  I saw each other.  All right.  Maybe I did.  And he nodded and waved to me and I nodded and waved to him.  Oh, really?  That's what a couple of, uh.  You got a picture with Ben Stiller from that night?  No.  Did not.  Why not?  I already had one from another event.  And I got it signed when he came in.  Excuse me.  Oh, okay. 
[03:01:00]  He was, was I here when he was in?  Jesus.  It was one of those days I was out.  Sometimes I miss some of these celebrities when they come in, you know, days off.  Jimmy's going through an entire hygiene routine here.  This is amazing.  We are sitting here, ladies and gentlemen, you don't know what's going on behind the scenes  here.  Jimmy Norton is, uh, doing his morning hygiene ritual.  He's changed his clothes.  He, um, has put on some cologne.  He's brushed his teeth.  He trimmed, he trimmed his janitorial area.  He trimmed, yes. 
[03:01:30]  He trimmed down.  And, uh, he, he is using some mouthwash now.  Mm-hmm.  And then he's got some dentine gum he's going to pop in his mouth for this big meeting.  This must be a very important meeting.  Are you, you're not used to it, uh, not being salty?  Exactly.  It's weird to actually hold it in my mouth.  Can someone just put their hand on my head so I can swallow it?  Yeah, no, I just gotta, I gotta do go right from work and I flew and everything, so I wanted 
[03:02:00]  to make sure I was clean.  All fresh.  Yeah, I gotta be sad.  It's your ass, though.  You're sitting in a plane seat for five hours.  Not, dude, my, I mean, it's probably not as pleasant as it would be, but it's not bad.  My ass, I don't really get swamp ass.  It's rare.  Well, first class, you can request them, uh, to scrub your asshole.  Uh, it's amazing.  Yeah.  They come by with the hot cloth and the gentle soap.  And they put their finger, they wrap it around their finger like a little church steeple.  Yeah, yeah, get in there.  You still get that in first class.  You can't get chips or pretzels in coach class, but they haven't gotten rid of the ass  scrubbing.  Ass scrubbing.  They're, uh, fantastic. 
[03:02:30]  That's the only reason I get first class.  Did you fill out your brackets yet?  Brackets, brackets, brackets, brackets.  I have to.  I don't give a shit about the fucking brackets.  I don't have anything about college.  That's your shit.  You're the one who brought it up to start with.  I brought it up in the context of I hate college basketball.  I hate March Madness.  Everything's March Madness now.  I was trying to watch one of those goddamn great crime shows.  Sure.  Some woman went out and apparently, uh, got raped.  That's every show.  Yeah, it was that show.  And, uh, I'm trying to watch it and somebody's talking and all of a sudden a basketball 
[03:03:00]  comes bouncing onto the screen and goes into a, a bracket thing that is taking up a good  quarter of the screen and just stays there as they talk about March Madness and what they're  going to be doing.  I don't want, I don't care.  I could give a shit about college basketball.  A lot of people's brackets got screwed up yesterday.  Why?  Iona didn't get to, didn't win the qualifying game.  No, I thought, uh, Iona was going to go all the way.  How about I borrow a, oh, chip, oh, chip.  That was my, that was my horse. 
[03:03:30]  That was it, huh?  Yeah.  Died in the backstretch.  That was your investment strategy?  Yeah, I had to change some of my brackets.  I don't know what, uh, team is good, what team is bad, what team is traditionally good.  You know, March Madness is like St. Patrick's Day.  Yeah.  Everybody's Irish.  Everybody loves college basketball.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what it seems like.  No one talks about or watches college basketball the rest of the year.  Oh, yeah, that's a realistic commercial.  Um, okay, just once again, the white burglar.  I'm not saying, I'm not saying it never happens, I'm sure it does, but Jesus, how about some 
[03:04:00]  balance in the commercials?  Uh, what game has Obama just had a college game with Cameron from England?  They're going out to the first round game in, uh, Ohio.  They have good tickets.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nosebleed seats.  They're going to hope to get tickets.  They're going to go and hope that somebody's selling something out front.  That's one thing with being the president's got to be cool.  Any sporting event you want to go to, although you're such a target, it's like, it's probably  not even fun.  You can't relax in like a stadium unless you're in a booth, like an owner's booth.  Yeah.  John Wilkes booth. 
[03:04:30]  But it's kind of...  Whatever.  Ancient history joke.  I bet if you're in the owner's booth, they, uh, they'll probably put in special glass,  like, so you know you're okay.  But if you're just sitting out there in the, in the...  It's not like he just drops in.  Yeah.  I'm sure that it's, it's done beforehand.  There's security everywhere.  They make sure they put a little extra security at the doors with the metal detectors and whatnot.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Mr. President.  It's a partially obstructed view that we got for you on this seat.  Real full house tonight, Mr. President.  You just dropping in. 
[03:05:00]  Ah, it's not so good.  Ah.  About five, ten minutes.  What would they do if the President called last minute and said, uh, I want ten tickets.  What if this is Obama wanted ten Super Bowl tickets day of?  I need ten Super Bowl tickets on the 50.  Ah.  What do you do?  You say no.  You say no.  You say no.  We say no.  We got, we got citizens who spent their hard-earned dollars on this.  Well.  You watch it at home.  I don't really care about them.  Send me.  Give me a ticket.  I bet you can get two.  Someone would give theirs up to curry favor. 
[03:05:30]  Curry favor.  Like how?  They're just missing the Super Bowl.  Yeah.  Now, maybe you need something signed.  I give you these tickets.  I expect you to okay my arms deal to North Korea.  Yeah.  Okay.  You got it.  Yeah.  I don't, uh, I don't think, uh, he would do that.  I don't think he'd put people in that position.  Even Obama.  I don't think he would.  But, yeah, that's got to be, like, some high-security shit going on when, uh, he goes to a game.  And he, I don't think they stay the whole game. 
[03:06:00]  No.  He's walking out with the crowd.  It does have to suck it.  Giant crowd around him.  Yeah.  Like, hey, he's my father.  Because you can't even have the fun like a celebrity.  Like, you talk about a celebrity who doesn't have a public or a private life.  It's different than a politician, even.  Yeah.  Because you're not having the fun.  Yeah.  When did that stop for presidents?  Presidents used to actually go out and do things.  You think it was Kennedy?  Yeah.  I mean, there were assassinations before that.  No, no.  But Nixon, Carter, Ford, Reagan, they were all, like, stiffs.  None of those guys were out banging chicks.  If they did, it was quiet.  Yeah. 
[03:06:30]  But Reagan was shot.  And Ford, there was attempts made on his life by, uh, what's it?  Squeaky.  Squeaky brawn.  And someone else.  And another woman.  And the other one, yeah.  I'm only thinking a guy's fucking not getting shot at.  What?  Oh, I see what you're saying.  I'm saying they didn't leave, like, those movies start a lot, like, going on and getting laid.  Oh, right.  I'm saying KJFK was the last guy that was probably doing that.  Yeah.  Doing that.  Like, William Howard Taft would have girls brought to his room.  Taft.  Probably, yeah.  I bet he was a wild man.  Yeah.  But, like, did they, did, did, uh, did presidents start getting, when did they start getting the heavy secret service? 
[03:07:00]  Was it after Lincoln?  No, it was after, um.  It started with Lincoln, but then, you know.  No, it was Eisenhower.  I want to say Eisenhower.  Oh, it had to be before that.  Two guys, the White House, you used to be able to walk right up to the White House, and a couple of guys that were, I believe, Spanish, Puerto Rican guys, I believe, went to fuck with, was it Eisenhower or Truman?  One of those guys.  It might have been true.  I don't remember which one.  But look up the start of the secret service.  Well, Pinkerton started in the secret service, but that was during Lincoln's days.  But you're right in the sense that it still was, obviously, it still wasn't, you know, heavy coverage of the president. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, no, you could, you could get to, remember the, uh, the famous Alan Funt thing where the one guy walked by the president every block?  And said, hello, Mr. President.  Good morning, Mr. President.  Holy shit.  They pranked the president.  The president was that.  Where he was walking.  He would be wrestled to the ground.  No, it was a citizen.  There was another citizen.  I mean, all these people say hello to me.  In this day and age, they'd wrestle him to the ground.  No, it was like they kept taking this guy and driving him back down the block.  Yeah, it was Truman's assassination attempt.  Wow. 
[03:08:00]  Blair House, right.  Secret service was created by President Lincoln.  Okay, one point to Mike.  Whoops.  All right.  One point to Jim for the Truman thing.  That sucks.  He creates the secret service and then he gets shot.  Fuck Lincoln, huh?  He created it, but he didn't give him enough resources.  I guess not.  That budget wasn't big enough.  I'm just going to be in this balcony here.  Leave the door open for anybody.  He just told them the secrets.  I'm still working this out.  I'm not quite sure where I want this whole thing to go. 
[03:08:30]  It wasn't really created to protect him at the time.  It was to counterfeiting.  Oh, counterfeiting from the South.  Of course.  Oh, the South would counterfeit the North's money to devalue it.  They took presidential duties, I believe, after the Truman assassination.  No, no.  After the assassination of President William McKinley in 1901.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So the Secret Service assumed full-time responsibility for presidential protection in 1902.  Wow.  Educational programming.  It is.  This is.  On the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, look at this.  Yeah, we're teaching you something.  No, we're just, what do we know?  We're just regular Joes. 
[03:09:00]  You're going to laugh and maybe you'll learn a little something.  Boat, boat, boat, boat.  Now let's go to the happy birthdays.  Yeah.  Oh.  Who tried killing Truman?  What was his major maladjustment?  Jimmy's right.  Two Puerto Rican nationalists approached Blair House with the intent to assassinate Truman.  Uh, blah, blah, blah.  Open fire on Private Leslie, uh, Koffelt and other White House police officers.  Wow.  Uh, though mortally wounded by three shots from a nine millimeter to his chest and abdomen, 
[03:09:30]  the private returned fire, uh, killing one with a single shot to the head.  Nice.  What a guy.  Nice.  What a guy.  Mortally wounded means he died, right?  I'm sorry?  Yeah.  Mortally wounded means he did die.  Ah.  But Kennedy had full-time protection.  That was 1960, I think.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that worked out well.  And Kennedy was a couple years later.  That worked out very well for him.  That was also his stubbornness, though.  He probably didn't want the bubble top because he didn't want to be seen as, uh, you know,  it was Dallas, hostile territory.  He wanted to be out in the open.  Yeah.  Well, he certainly was, as we, uh, as we all know. 
[03:10:00]  Very bad move.  Tactical.  Very bad move.  Yeah, we can go.  Secret Service.  They violated the most basic orders of protection, Mr. Garrison.  Yeah, great.  Truth's on your side.  Truth's on your side, Bubba.  Truth's on your side, Bubba.  And the truth is on your side, Bubba.  I think you said the truth is on your side, Bubba.  Was there Secret Service with Lady Gaga?  Hope you get a break.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It appeared to be.  A lot of security.  A lot of security.  A lot of people.  Yeah, I'm sure, uh, she had her peeps, her posse. 
[03:10:30]  A lot of people.  Outside was pandemonium.  Yeah.  Out front.  There were a lot of people out there, uh, going crazy for the Gogs.  There was a lot of people outside yesterday.  I don't know if it was for Nicole Ritchie.  There was nobody.  Really?  I think, yeah, Nicole Ritchie was up here yesterday.  I don't think there's anyone more famous than her.  And there was a lot of people outside.  Because they wanted to see if she brought the clay head from her father's video.  She didn't have it with her.  No?  Mm-mm.  The big clay head?  Mm-mm.  She said Lionel Ritchie, though, listens to his own songs all the time.  Really? 
[03:11:00]  Mm-hmm.  That's got to be awkward.  Oh, man.  You're just seeing that dancing on the ceiling.  He loves it.  This is good, man, right?  Mm-hmm.  Come here, come here.  Wasn't this good?  Listen to this song again.  It's almost up.  Look, I'm saying hello.  Is it me you're looking for?  Listen, listen.  It's great.  Look at the clay head.  I used to like that song.  You know, I saw the Commodores in 1976.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Brick House.  Oh, jeez.  That brick.  Yeah.  You went to the Commodores.  I did.  I did.  Yeah. 
[03:11:30]  Well, that shit was big.  You were watching Zoom, kids.  I was watching Zoom.  Zoom-a-zoom-a-zoom.  Us wearing big flare pants and going to the Commodores.  Bell Bottoms.  Yeah.  Wear your bell bottoms and your wide lapel jackets.  Yeah, they all called him Sweater Vest Motherfucker.  He's the white guy at the show.  What his nickname would have been.  Besides the gogs, who else has been in here that's been like huge that we never had a chance  of interviewing ever, ever?  Yeah, J-Lo that we never had a chance. 
[03:12:00]  J-Lo's a big one.  Dirk Jeter.  Jeter.  Jeter.  Cal Ripken Jr.  Why wouldn't Jeter do our show?  We are like the target demo.  I don't know.  Why?  And Cal Ripken Jr. too.  Jonah Hill.  Well, was Cal Ripken Jr. the one that...  Yeah, the most games consecutive played.  Great player.  Great player.  Who was the guy that I asked the awkward question to?  That was...  Wasn't that Greg Maddux?  No.  Joe DiMaggio? 
[03:12:30]  I think...  Wasn't that him?  What's his face?  Dirk Jeter.  Dirk Jeter, right?  Cal Ripken Jr.  Cal Ripken Jr.  Yeah, what's his name from fucking...  Kevin Costner, right?  There was some kind of weird rumor story.  Kevin Costner had had sex with his wife.  Oh, yes.  On the phone, yeah.  Well, I had sex with your wife.  Roland said you made an Amber Alert joke to Mark Messier and he didn't laugh.  Oh, boy.  What happened?  Oh, boy.  I don't know.  I'm going to look for it, but this is what he just...  No, well, that was that one.  Let's find that moment.  It was the one where I had brought up, what happened with you and Kevin Costner? 
[03:13:00]  Because somebody said...  Somebody on PalTalk just put up, ask him about Kevin Costner.  And I was just like, hey, what's the deal with Kevin Costner?  And everybody in the room froze because they all knew the story that it was this fucking  big mix-up that people...  There was pretty much evidence that his wife had had sex with Kevin Costner.  But now he's got to explain, no, no, well, they're good friends.  And then he went over to the house.  No, I knew nothing. 
[03:13:30]  I thought maybe, you know, Field of Dreams.  He almost missed a game.  She loved Waterworld.  Yeah, yeah, Waterworld.  Yeah, it was Ripken, I think.  It was, I know it was.  He almost missed a game.  Right, during the streak.  Yeah.  And they were like, there was a problem with the lights.  And the rumor was that there was a problem with the lights in Baltimore.  They had to cancel the game.  But the rumor was that there was no problem with the lights.  He wasn't going to make it because he had this problem with his wife.  That was just a rumor.  Yeah.  I didn't know there was any basis in truth.  And so it wouldn't blow his record.  They said there was a problem with the lights. 
[03:14:00]  So he could go home and beat up Kevin Costner, who was obviously having some kind of sexual liaison.  Yeah.  I'm getting communique from Dr. Gay.  And he said that the Biebs was in the house yesterday.  Justin Biebs?  When was it?  When?  A while back.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, a couple months ago.  But we were talking about, you know, giant celebrities.  Oh, yeah.  He took my, he signed my picture.  I thought you meant that's who the people were for yesterday.  Oh, no.  Justin Bieber's losing his juice.  I think so, too.  He's not gay.  All over that hot girlfriend of his.  Yeah, I know. 
[03:14:30]  Who, Selena Gomez?  Oh, yeah.  Are they still an item?  I guess.  She's not even my favorite.  I just like.  No.  I know.  I just say things because I guess pop culture has told me that she's hot.  I'm supposed to like.  She is, though.  If you look at her pictures, I got to point with her.  She's cute.  I wouldn't mind giving her the old smooch test.  There's like, there's way hotter chicks than her in my opinion.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I was, I was walking around Times Square yesterday and, and there was a, there was a, one girl  passed by and it was one of those moments where it's like, I just have to,  I have to grab her.  Yeah, dude. 
[03:15:00]  I have to, I have to have sexual intercourse.  And today, I mean, the second, the second you.  How did that turn out?  I just kept walking.  My mind said that, but that's the difference between the guys that really do it and me.  It's like hibernating though.  Cause like you have all winter where these girls are all covered up and they're not,  they're not necessarily attractive because they have all this shit on them.  And then yesterday was such a nice day here in New York.  Yeah.  And then the fucking layers started coming off and it, it really, I felt like I was 14 going  through puberty again.  It was crazy.  Cause every girl that's walking by, I'm like, Oh man, she's so hot. 
[03:15:30]  Oh man.  It was crazy.  They all, and I don't know how they pull out their fucking summer attire so quickly, but  I was seeing a bunch of those little black shippy shorts and lots of legs were all over  the place.  It was great.  Oh, summertime in New York is a really cool town.  It's a cool place to be.  It is.  Cause there's just so much.  If you're in some small fucking town, some small city, what are you going to see?  It is everywhere.  Cause it's like, you know, it's the, the subway, the train, your hometown, you go to  work.  It's just nonstop, nonstop all day. 
[03:16:00]  It's cleavage fucking.  And this place is fucking ridiculous with some of the, with the interns that are walking  around this joint.  Yeah.  I must say holy mackerel 40 times a day.  Holy mackerel.  Sometimes I'll hold string of them.  Holy mackerel, holy mackerel, holy mackerel.  Bunch of girls.  Annoying.  You don't say that.  I do.  Holy mackerel.  That's a school of mackerels.  Yeah.  Holy mackerel.  They're all holy.  Yes.  Something.  Yeah.  Or something.  Um, the hell, what do you say we, uh, boogie on out? 
[03:16:30]  You got a meeting?  Yeah.  I got sleep to catch up on.  I'm tired too, man.  Yeah.  What time's your meeting?  11.  So the taping is coming up, right?  April 28th.  But tomorrow through Saturday.  Yes.  I'll be at a half full room, the Orlando Improv, and then next Friday and Saturday, Uncle Vinny's  in Point Pleasant.  I've never done the room before, but I'm going to work out material.  Whoa.  You've never done Uncle Vinny's?  No.  March 29th through April 1, Caroline's here in New York. 
[03:17:00]  April 12th through 14, the DC Improv.  My first time ever performing there.  And, uh, then June 9th, Antisocial, Foxwoods, me, Nick, Artie Lang, David Till.  Jim, I think you should have an announcer do these.  I know.  With a little more energy.  I know.  I can't plug with any enthusiasm.  If they want to come, they'll come.  If not, uh, fuck them.  Don't come.  And you must do your brackets tomorrow, I think. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, God.  Can I do mine?  Yeah, you must.  What do I got to do?  You just pick teams.  I don't even know what to pick.  If you'd like, we have Rich Voss in tomorrow.  He can do brackets as well.  Oh, great.  Brackets.  I've thrown the same.  Yeah.  There you go.  Well, we can have him, uh, say all the different school names.  I'm sure he'll get them all right.  Oh, that's true.  He'll start the finish.  He'll get fucked that up.  He probably knows Gonzaga.  I'm sure he does.  I'll have him say it over the list and then just pick where the spit went. 
[03:18:00]  I'll pick that team.  Villano-mer.  Villano-mer.  I'm sorry you have Villano-mer.  You want to get out of here?  What do you got going there, Mr. Baker?  Me, I got business.  Work, work, work.  That's why I'm in my suit.  I'm going from here to a couple of meetings and, you know, pitch the diligence.  Any, uh, any red eyes coming up?  Uh, any appearances?  I'm doing the, I guess, I think I'm subbing in for, for Andy a couple of times. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah.  You do a good job at that one.  Yeah.  It's not easy.  You know what?  I tell you, that's the toughest job on that show.  You got to start thinking as people are saying stuff and then start concocting what you're  going to say as they're still saying stuff that might be good for you to concoct.  Yeah.  I finally, I cracked the nut by realizing that I just don't bother to pay attention and then  you just talk about whatever the hell you want to talk about.  Yeah, that's pretty much, uh, that's pretty much it.  It works.  But like DeRosa when he's got that duty and he tries so hard.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And his jokes are just bombing.  Yeah.  Because if you, if you sit there during a course of a, you know, and you, because you've got 
[03:19:00]  very little time to try to come up with something.  So if you base what you're going to say on what people are saying, you're basically walking  in there, sitting down and rolling the dice, hoping that the people that are sitting  around the table are going to say something funny or unusual that you can play off of.  Yeah.  And, and, you know, sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn't, but I just think it's  easier just not to listen.  Yeah.  Just do your own thing.  Yeah.  Fuck it.  Yeah.  All right.  Mike Baker.  Thanks so much for coming in.  No, thank you.  World's greatest radio show.  Oh, this is a blast.  Oh, I love it.  Uh, Sam Roberts.  Thank you so much, uh, for not being in here this morning when the mics went on. 
[03:19:30]  You know what happened?  E-Rock had to come sprinting in.  Can I tell you why that was?  Yeah.  Sluff it off?  No.  Danny.  I think it was a joke.  Yeah.  Danny, Travis, and me, we're going to see how long you and E-Rock would do the show together.  And then we just got uncomfortable and came right in.  Oh, oh.  We were going to, we were going to leave you alone like the whole hour.  Oh, that would have been fun.  But then it just, it got weird.  I wasn't even going to, I wasn't really going to talk to E-Rock at all.  I was just, I was just going to talk about TV and shit.  Well, that's what I told Travis.  I was like, Ant's just going to end up talking by himself. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah.  So we were like, let's go in.  Ah, yeah.  That's pretty much what I would have ended up doing.  Yeah.  Just yapping.  But E-Rock came sprinting in here.  Oh, it was horrifying.  Let's see what happens.  Everybody saw the chemistry between you and Eric and they didn't like it.  Got a little jealous.  Yeah.  They saw that fucking Eric magic all those years in Florida radio.  Ah, that's right.  Fucking they knew better.  They're talking about Florida.  Ska and the Simpsons.  Yeah.  Doing a Simpsons show. 
[03:20:30]  Cartoon theme song mashups.  It's never anything else.  It's just cartoon theme show mashups.  I hate cartoons.  They mashed up, someone mashed up He-Man and the snorks.  It's really cool.  Oh, God.  E-Rock, you watch He-Man?  I have them, yes.  What do you say?  E-Rock's a baby.  No.  You're a baby.  He-Man, yeah, no, you put your head in the grave, you know where that fucking shit  goes.  Yeah, right to the Navy.  Fucking, yeah.  Put some bubble gum on that fucker.  All right, Travis, of course, Dr. Gay Danny, thank you so much. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And we'll see you, Monjani.  Hey, butt.  The O.P. and Anthony Show on Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the O.P. and Anthony Show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  After O&A.  I'm just trying to relate to the kids. 
[03:21:30]  You know, the Jersey Shore kids are all going to be in the Three Stooges movie.  We were talking about that today.  I thought maybe if I did some...  Pauly D.  Yeah, maybe that would, you know, bring the Jersey Shore and After O&A Live.  Well, forget that.  Are you excited about the Pauly D Project?  Yeah, I was watching.  You know what?  Pauly D's getting his own show.  The Pauly D Project is coming on.  I think it starts next week, right?  Yeah, I haven't watched Jersey Shore at all in the last, like, two seasons.  But I started watching...  I watched, like, every episode over the weekend. 
[03:22:00]  Did you see?  They were literally running every episode of every season this weekend.  Yeah, I think it wraps up next Thursday.  Yeah, I think...  Yeah, tomorrow.  I think it's the season finale.  Tomorrow it is?  I think tomorrow's the season finale.  And that's when we find out...  Get this.  You see, the rest of the Jersey Shore kids, they went camping.  While they were gone, Vinny and Pauly D, they stayed home.  And they moved everything that was outside the house inside the house. 
[03:22:30]  And everything that was inside the house, they moved outside the house, right?  They're always up to no good.  So Snooki, she comes to the door.  She's opening it.  And just as she's about to say, what's going on in here?  Boom.  End of episode.  Cliffhanger.  Wait till the season finale for this one, folks.  So I can't wait for the Jersey Shore season finale to find out how the cast reacts to finding out that their beds, again, outside the house, while the outdoor furniture is inside the house. 
[03:23:00]  So, I mean, that's just something to look forward to for tomorrow night, if that's what you're into.  But I don't know.  The Jersey Shore is a show...  I mean, it used to be the show.  But now it's like I can't...  It's not appointment viewing anymore.  I can't sit there and be like, oh, this is the...  Unless something exciting like the big reveal of this prank is happening.  But if there's a marathon of that show on, I'll sit there for hours watching it.  I mean, I think that's the best way to take in reality shows. 
[03:23:30]  I can't really sit there and say I'm going to watch a reality show every single week unless it's Celebrity Apprentice.  That one, it's every week.  But other than that, it's got to be marathon viewing.  Eric, I was following your Get Glue.  You have been Jersey Shoring pretty much weekly.  Or were you just collecting the stickers?  No, I watch it every week.  I don't usually watch it live, though.  It's off the DVR.  How do you get the stickers then?  Because I see you've gotten some Jersey Shore stickers on Get Glue. 
[03:24:00]  I'll know it's on, and I'll check in to Get Glue.  Just to get the sticker.  But I'll watch it maybe either later that night or the next.  It's usually next day.  That's the trick.  Yeah.  Because I DVR Celebrity Apprentice, and I'll watch last week's episode the same time this week's episode is on.  You know what I mean?  So I'm a week behind.  You get the sticker.  But I'll still Get Glue it as it's happening to get that Celebrity Apprentice sticker.  I'm no fool.  I'm no fool, ladies and gentlemen.  I've got to get my TV show stickers.  Ever since we started talking about that, I really didn't pay attention to the people who follow you on that. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah.  But my numbers jump.  Yeah.  It's the same thing that happened with Instagram.  Yeah.  As soon as we mentioned on the air, you know, people enjoy seeing what we're watching.  For me, it's just wrestling shows and 90210.  But still, people enjoy it.  But, yeah, I was talking to Nicole from the morning mashup who turned on ONA, I guess, last week whenever we were talking about it.  And she was like, yeah, I heard you on the show.  You guys were just talking about, like, getting stickers for watching TV shows? 
[03:25:00]  Is that what the show is now?  Well, that's what the show was at that one moment in time.  Are they using it now?  Is that part of the morning mashup discussion about their Get Glue stickers?  They probably had to have some meeting about it so they could figure out how they could make it trending and make it, you know, something notable for the morning mashup to talk about for two and a half minutes before they put Katy Perry back on.  Don't judge the way we do our show.  We actually have to talk for all this time.  You guys just do the same bit every week. 
[03:25:30]  Look, Nicole is stupider than the people who are on the street.  Now back to the hits.  You know what I mean?  Well, you've got to give the people what they want.  What is it?  They want the hits.  Eric.  They want to know Nicole is stupid.  They want to know that Nicole is still a dummy and that she still will play whoever, their Kelly Clarkson for them or their Red Solo Cup by Toby Keith, whatever is going on.  I was talking about that on the Sunday show this week.  People hate that song.  Yeah, that song's been, what, about two months now it's been out? 
[03:26:00]  Yeah.  I got Mikey Piff from this one.  And it's still up in the top of the charts.  He's the programmer.  Yeah.  And I was talking to him on the Sam Roberts show on Sunday here on this channel, and I called him up.  I was like, Piff, I know your programming hits, Juan, you know, this is your job.  It seemed like they were doing a label a favor, didn't it?  Yeah.  I was like, why is this on?  And he said they have to talk to the people in the Midwest.  They have to talk to all the country.  And people were digging that song.  I was even getting Twitters from people who were upset that I was making fun of this Red Solo Cup song. 
[03:26:30]  One guy said, it's a goof.  Why would you make fun of a song?  It's a goof, just like Boy Named Sue.  It's not a goof.  And I was like, Boy Named Sue is like a song.  I mean, it's a story.  It's funny at points.  But it's a real song that somebody actually sat down and put some thought into to write.  Johnny Cash specifically.  Toby Keith didn't put any thought into this Red Solo Cup song.  You know that I listen to the Sam Roberts show every morning on Hits 1.  Yeah, I've had to intro Red Solo Cup. 
[03:27:00]  And I get angry when I fucking hear that song.  I hate that song with passion.  I wonder if they're air-checking me sometimes.  Because any time I've had to intro that song, it's a real smart-ass thing.  Like, hey, Sam Roberts, Sirius XM Hits 1.  I guess we're playing this now.  And this song will come on.  Well, you know, I've got to maintain some integrity.  I am a fan of Hits 1.  You know this.  You've got to stay current.  Yeah, and they're playing music that I just, I don't know why they're playing it.  What else do you hate on that channel? 
[03:27:30]  Well, I don't know if I, I don't hate the song, but I don't know why Skrillex is being played on Hits.  Skrillex is, and they're playing, we're playing the shit out of Skrillex.  Well, Skrillex is big right now.  Well, Skrillex is big, but it's not a, it's not a hit.  It's not a hit song.  See, the thing about Sirius XM Hits 1 is they look at whatever is, like, big-ish or buzz.  You know, there's a buzz about Skrillex right now, right?  Right.  So they're just going to try and take that and see if they can be the first hits channel to play it.  And then if that becomes a crossover hit, they get the credit for being the first to play it. 
[03:28:00]  No, it makes sense.  It just, it's just, it's really noisy, and it just doesn't, it doesn't really sound right on the channel.  And another song that just doesn't really sound right to me is M83.  What song is that?  Um, oh, what's the name?  It's, it's, it's, it's, they're hit right now.  I can't remember the name of the song.  But it's just, I don't even know what the hook of the song is.  Yeah, they do some weird stuff.  I mean, they played that, uh, uh, what's the song where it was just that person's name over and over again?  Barbra Streisand?  Yeah.  They played the shit out of Barbra Streisand. 
[03:28:30]  That makes a little bit more sense, because it's dancey, and it's, you know, clubby.  I mean, every club is playing that song at that time.  Although, although, to be fair, I'll get down, at first I was like, why is Skrillex on this channel?  I don't understand it all.  I'll get down to it now.  I like the song.  It doesn't, I don't know if it makes sense on the channel, but, you know, what the hell do I know?  I'm not a programmer for the channel.  But it really is.  Like, they're, they're looking, I mean, I'm telling you, people think that it's just like, it is just the same, whatever, 40 songs over and over again.  But the attention to detail that gets put into programming this channel is unbelievable. 
[03:29:00]  I think there's more attention paid to what's going on on Serious Hits 1 than any other music channel.  Like, they're, they're looking, they're, they're toiling over every chart, seeing what's playing where, because they're programming for the whole country, not just one market.  Yeah.  And, and, and they're going crazy, not only, you know, making sure of, and if, and if you hear one song on the channel over and over again,  that was intended. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah.  Like, they want that song that specific many times in that hour.  And, and they're always looking for the next thing.  Like, they're playing the shit out of the Childish Gambino single.  Yeah.  Because that, it was great.  It's an amazing song.  I'm glad they're playing it.  I love it.  But Hits 1 was the first, or the second.  One Top 40 station was playing it in LA.  Yeah.  And so they were like, this song is getting a buzz.  We can be on top of this.  No, I give them credit for that.  And that's what they're trying to do with Skrillex and.  Kid Kelly's the fucking man. 
[03:30:00]  He does a great job with it.  He, he, he cares.  Yeah.  No, it's, it's, it's an awesome channel.  But, um, yeah, I mean, I don't, I don't get everything they're doing either, but I, what do I, like, like you said, like, I'm not, I'm not going to tell them what to do.  I trust them.  Yeah, those guys are tapped into something that we just don't understand.  Yeah, I don't get it at all.  Yeah.  I'm just like, look, I'll talk for real quick between songs if you'll let me.  I'll take an answer, though, because there's times that I, I'll wake up, I'll put it on, because I listened to your show in the morning.  And before I leave, before I turn it off to go into work, I'll hear the same song that I heard when I woke up. 
[03:30:30]  And how long do you listen?  Because I might hit one from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m. most.  So I listen from about, like, quarter to, quarter to five till about 5.30.  And you'll hear the same song twice.  I'll hear the same song twice.  Yeah, I mean, they're just trying, I guess, because the average person probably listens for less than 45 minutes.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Like, I don't assume, I do a talk break on that channel every, like, 15 minutes or so. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah.  And I don't assume that any person hears my voice more than once, twice max.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  I just, I had to vent my anger towards Red Solo Cup.  It's a horrible song.  It's awful.  I get angry.  And I swear, half the people I was talking to, I don't know if you listen to the Sunday show I was doing, but half the people I was talking to were saying, you know, you're so right, it's a terrible, and the other half was like, you don't understand, it's an anthem, this song is hilarious, it's great, we played at our parties, country guys were calling up saying, don't hate on Toby Keith, it's a funny song, why would you take it so seriously? 
[03:31:30]  Yeah, but there's a lot of country stations and country people out there that don't like Toby Keith just because of the bullshit songs he puts out.  Exactly, that's my, and one guy was saying.  He's not one of those respected country artists that everyone, everything he puts out, like a Garth, well, Garth Brooks is old, but Tim McGraw or somebody like that, where no matter what he puts out, everybody likes it.  There's a lot of people that don't like Toby Keith, even in the country community.  And that's what I was saying, like, even though, like, people were saying, you know, don't bash country just because you're from New York. 
[03:32:00]  And I try to say, like, the reason I'm bashing Toby Keith is not because I don't like country music, it's because this is why people in New York don't like country music.  Like, I don't, I was raised on country music, you know what I mean?  You don't really like it, though, do you?  I get into it.  Really?  I play a bunch of it for Jess, yeah, she's never heard any of it.  Like, new, not like classic country music.  Not like new, new, but like new enough, like Garth Brooks and stuff like that, which isn't classic, I don't think, you know, within the last 15 years, country, yeah. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah, I just don't get it.  Yeah, I mean, I understand that there's a market of people that like it, and I like classic country, but I don't like.  But the only breakout, the only crossover hits, because there's no country music in New York, they took it off the radio.  Yeah.  So the only crossover hits that we really hear are songs like Toby Keith doing this shitty, dumbass Red Solo Cup.  And that the other, the last one I could remember, I talked about this one too on the Sunday show, was the Let's Check Each Other for Ticks song.  I don't even know that. 
[03:33:00]  It's just about checking for ticks.  I want to check you for ticks.  And it's just like, come on, dude.  Like, this is why people over here on the East Coast, coastal people, are sitting there going, I can't relate to this at all.  Like, this is a foreign language to me.  I don't understand how anyone could be in this.  But it also goes to the flip side of that, because they'll listen to hip-hop, and if you really think about it, like, you know, a song that goes, the chorus is Rack City, Rack, Rack City, bitch. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah, don't hate on Tiger.  No, I love it.  And when that comes on the club, everybody's hands are up, it's like, oh, yeah, Rack City.  But, you know, people out in fucking, you know, middle of the country are like, what the fuck is this shit?  I might be wrong, but I think enough good hip-hop moves throughout the country.  You know what I mean?  I think hip-hop has gotten more broad than country music has.  Yeah.  Like, I think hip-hop infuses the middle of the country more than country music infuses the coast.  But the hillbillies that Toby Keith are talking to about, Red Solo Cup, and they'll think that's great, won't like Rack City, bitch. 
[03:34:00]  They won't see the similarities, you're saying.  They won't see that it's the same.  The integrity of the writing in the music is equivalent.  Right.  Neither of which are like, let it be.  You know what I mean?  There's no, they're not going to stand the test of time.  There's nothing deeper here.  Right.  This guy is singing about plastic cups.  Yeah.  Or titties.  Titties.  Whichever one you want to, yeah.  I was just, I never heard the Tick song until you mentioned it. 
[03:34:30]  I was just previewing it.  It's horrible.  Listen to it.  Because Troy hasn't heard it yet.  Yeah, I haven't heard it.  Listen, this is crossover country music.  Who is this?  Brad Paisley.  Listen to this song.  And this was a big Grammy song.  See, as soon as that guitar comes, I'm going to puke.  You don't like the twanging?  No.  I'm going to puke.  I'm okay with twanging.  But then once the lyrics.  It's the same formula in every song.  It's the same formula in every time you take a sip.  It already rhymes with Ticks.  In this smoky atmosphere. 
[03:35:00]  You press that body to your head.  You know, modernize it.  They broke it down.  They gave it to your heart.  And they broke it right back down.  They're going to build it back up.  It's the same formula in every fucking country song.  In the small there of your back.  In the small town bar.  Your jeans are playing peek-a-boo.  All righty.  Jeans are playing peek-a-boo.  Who says that?  Who talks like that?  People that would think this is great.  Yeah.  Peek-a-boo.  I'm a butterfly tattoo. 
[03:35:30]  Hey, that gives me an idea.  Let's get out of this bar.  Bar, I told you, small town bar.  I'm going to go to the country and find a place to park.  Because I'd like to see you out in the moonlight.  I'd like to kiss you way back in the sticks.  Hey, I'd like to walk you through a field of wildflowers.  I'd like to check you for ticks. 
[03:36:00]  Yeah.  How do we not think of, like, a fucking, how do we not call people hillbillies?  If you're singing, you know what I mean?  But I can totally picture in a bar in fucking, like, Idaho.  And when that comes on, everybody in the bar is singing along.  Everybody just pounding the bar.  And then everybody together, I want to tick you for ticks.  And somehow they have a tick dance.  I don't know what that is, but it's sort of like a...  They're just moving their fingers around like little legs and stuff.  Yeah.  Roland, you're a, what's his name, guy? 
[03:36:30]  You're a team Blake Shelton guy.  You bet you're sweet tits.  Are you a fan of this country music?  I love country music.  Born in Austin, so I went to a ton of country concerts.  You were born in Austin?  Yeah.  How long did you live there?  Just, like, less than a year when I was a baby.  But you were, were you raised on country?  Yeah.  That's what your parents listened to?  Mm-hmm.  My mom did, yeah.  Me too.  But, like, what about Brad Paisley?  I've seen Brad in concert.  I've seen tons of them, like Tim McGraw.  Tim, but you don't think... 
[03:37:00]  You don't think the reason that people who don't really know country hate country music  is because Brad Paisley sings about checking people for tics, and that's what crosses over?  Or King Chesney, I think, my tractor's sexy.  What the fuck is that?  Yeah, like, they'll do those songs, or, um...  They have one song, I forget what it's called, and in the middle of the song goes,  Chips, hot dog, and barbecue.  I mean, those are my favorite things, but his song is hard to sing.  He said those are my favorite things.  I mean, it's like that, though, in any single genre.  I mean, if you look at, like, if you break down, like, Jimmy Buffett songs, they're pretty fucking dumb. 
[03:37:30]  He's a fucking idiot, though, Jimmy Buffett.  And also, his burgers, there are so many people that love Jimmy Buffett.  This guy's on the channel here, right?  Yeah, he's on the channel.  I mean, his concerts are, like, massive.  In his own restaurants, which he should not have his own restaurants.  It's not good?  Me and the sex bag, we went.  I'll just say, we were very, very disappointed.  One's called Margaritaville.  That's the one.  And the other one is Cheeseburgers in Paradise. 
[03:38:00]  And the Cheeseburgers in Paradise one is garbage.  Oh, my God.  That's cheeseburger and shit.  What do you think of Toby Keith, though?  A lot of the triple-level, man.  Like, as he said, that kicked it.  And that's the other thing.  He did the Bin Laden song.  Yeah, that's right.  And then at that point, it became un-American to not like Toby Keith.  Yeah, so, yeah, you can't really trash on you.  So you're not allowed to bash him.  Trash on you.  Because he made a shitty song about Bin Laden.  The Red, White, and Blue song he did, yeah.  We wanna kick your summer's ass.  You couldn't think of anything more eloquent than that?  Yeah, out of all those 9-11, like, mash-ups and remixes and everything that came out, 
[03:38:30]  that was the one that got a lot of heat that made us look like total idiots.  But don't you think Toby Keith is, like, Toby Keith is damaging four-country music.  He has a weird song.  I forgot one of his first hits.  I can't remember what it is.  Everybody's talking to me about the song Smokin' Weed with Willie.  It's Toby Keith's song.  I can get down with that.  Well, you'd just like it.  I'd like to smoke some weed with Willie.  You would?  Yeah.  Or Blake Shelton's Honeymass.  See, that's another one.  I love it.  Blake Shelton got a resurgence from being on The Voice.  And what does he do?  He puts out that goofy song, Honey Bee. 
[03:39:00]  And by the way, it went nowhere.  Yeah, it went nowhere.  You know why?  Because the thing about these music shows, The Voice, American Idol, all of them, people like  the shows, but they're not interested in any of the music featured on them.  This song went nowhere.  Yeah, it did.  Look how many hits it gets.  God.  It went nowhere.  Yeah, it did.  Well, number one on the country charts.  On the country charts.  It would have gone number one anyway.  Not really.  It's the country charts.  Shut up. 
[03:39:30]  You can't do the accent.  I just, just, ugh.  Just, I don't know.  The music just doesn't, it's like the same music.  I can see a true DJ going like this.  Hey, Bee.  You like Garth?  No.  I love Garth.  You can't get down with Garth?  What about Thunder Road?  Thunder Road.  No, I grew up on country.  My parents loved country music.  Garth's covered shameless.  That's pretty good.  Yeah.  Troy, here's the hook.  I know, yeah.  I'll be your shadow escape.  You'll be my sunny day.  I'll be your sweet dreams. 
[03:40:00]  Yeah, I got it.  It's catchy.  I mean, you know, and girls, oh my God.  Country girls just fucking freak out over this shit.  They're smoking hot too.  Oh yeah, they are.  They are.  Everybody, Larry in Atlanta is going to tell us something we don't know.  Larry, you're on after Opie and Anthony Live.  Hollywood primetime, Sammy Sweetheart Roberts.  You got so hosed over the busted open show, it was total bullshit.  You're right.  You're right, Larry.  When you're right, you're right.  I don't know what the fuck that show's deal is.  I have no idea, but you got so hosed over it as I can quote Davey Mack. 
[03:40:30]  It's like Alabama in the 60s.  What's up, dude?  Well, when you check somebody for tits, you generally get their clothes off and look at  them.  He's not looking for bugs.  He's trying to get her clothes off.  I know.  But nobody, I know that.  But nobody in New York knows about checking for tits.  People in New York know about Rack City, bitch.  Just say, if you want to sing about titties, sing about titties.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, but that's country music.  If you listen to the album by Hank Williams, the Al Mira Club, he says they don't use the 
[03:41:00]  F word in country music.  Not one time.  It's just not part of the culture.  Yeah, I get it.  It makes sense to me.  I mean, I just, it's not my thing at all.  You don't like Busted Open?  The wrestling show?  Larry?  Oh, me?  No, I never listen to it because you're not on it.  Why would I listen to it if you're not on it?  Thank you very much, buddy.  See you.  See you, Sammy.  Later.  Yeah, I get it.  It's like, it's more tongue in cheek.  It's, you know, because it's like they're singing to the Bible Belt people. 
[03:41:30]  So you can't be like, I'm going to fuck you and your ass, bitch.  No, plus, you have to sell CDs at Walmart.  Exactly.  That's the...  But some of it, but you can, you can, you don't, there's, it's not either curse or sound  like a fucking moron.  Like, there's a medium you can find.  Like, the Beatles, how many F-bombs did the Beatles drop?  Four.  No, they didn't curse, they didn't curse at all.  Right.  And they were able to get by without saying, I want to check you for tics.  It was also a different time.  Like, Please Please Me is about oral sex.  So at that time, in 64, that was pretty risque. 
[03:42:00]  Yeah, but they were, they were probably, even if they were alive now, you think they  could get away without doing a tic song?  Yeah.  Yeah, probably.  It's a different time.  But, but, but, but if you, but again, dude, if you break down their songs, I mean, you  know, George Harrison had a song about piggies and...  I've talked to you about the Beatles before.  There are some dumb Beatles songs that you refuse to.  There's no Beatles.  When I'm 64 is a stupid-ass song.  That's, that's a McCartney classic. 
[03:42:30]  It's dumb.  Uh, Danielle, you're on after Opie and Anthony Live.  Who is it?  Well, this says, the phone screener says Danielle, but it's you.  Yes, definitely not Danielle.  Is it Daniel?  Everybody, yes, Danielle.  Apparently, apparently, he thinks Danielle, Daniel is spelled D-A-N-I-E-L-L-E.  Who's, who's back there screening?  When y'all think we're fucking idiots down here, that's bad.  Yeah, that's dumb.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying, Danielle.  And he changed it just now as if it makes a difference.  Paul, come in here, you fucking idiot. 
[03:43:00]  You want to say something stupid, you fucking idiot.  What'd he say?  He's like sitting there flicking me off.  I think Paul's going to get by hooked off phonics.  So what?  Paul likes to mouth off when no one's paying attention.  Oh, good.  Yeah, let's talk about that.  Daniel, I'm going to turn to Paul.  But you're saying you all don't listen to that shit, right?  It's for my place.  Now, see, everybody assumes just because you have this fucked up, retarded-ass accent that  I'm stuck with that you have to listen to.  Dude, I've never in my life checked anybody for a fucking kick.  And my family owns 10,000 acres of fucking farmland.  Well, you guys got to get rid of Toby Keith then. 
[03:43:30]  Dude, all of his songs aren't like that.  And all of the country music's not like that.  And now I listen to the majority of stuff that I listen to is like,  ACDC, and I like the harder side of older rock.  But, I mean, I do listen to some country music, but all of it's not like that.  Dude, there's a song by Jason Aldean, Dirt Road Anthem.  Check that out.  All right, I'd say, Daniel, I can't talk to you all day about country music.  What is this, the Daniel Show or the Sam Roberts After Open Anthony Live Show?  Boba Fett.  Come on.  By the way, look at all these phones. 
[03:44:00]  I hope that, you know, management should know that means someone's listening.  So, you know, it's funny that you bring Paul in because you were saying  that he wanted to say some stupid shit, you know, behind the glass to you.  Yeah, and Eric just said, oh, Paul always talks shit back here about everybody.  Where's Eric?  Is he in there?  I don't know.  Yeah, I was just looking for him trying to cover the phone.  Yeah, no, that's fine.  I just wanted to make sure you heard him.  Yeah, but it doesn't surprise me that Paul wouldn't come in and say what he has to say.  Because yesterday, when we had the whole E-Rock, you know, debacle, and E-Rock and I are doing 
[03:44:30]  much better since then.  God bless.  Paul said that he wanted to videotape how mad E-Rock was getting.  And I was like, well, why wouldn't you just tell me?  And he said, oh, I don't want to come on the air.  But he was like trying to get around, you know.  No, that's not what I said.  I said, I'm terrible on the air.  Well, still, you wanted to tell me privately that E-Rock was getting very upset.  You didn't want to publicly say, did you hear that, E-Rock?  Yeah, I heard.  He wanted to rat you out, but he didn't want to do it in front of the, you know. 
[03:45:00]  Oh, that's cute.  Why do you think that, Rowan?  Because I get scared.  You get scared, too.  He wanted to tip you off to like what's going on.  But, you know, don't get me in trouble for this.  I don't care if fucking Eric gets mad.  So what's Paul sitting there saying?  What shit is he talking there?  Because I know he does.  Well, let me tell you about today.  When I'm listening to Anthony and you guys talk, and he decides to huck something into the side of me.  And I go, what?  And he's complaining that the intern wasn't ordering his breakfast yet. 
[03:45:30]  And I said, I don't care about your damn breakfast.  Just order something.  The intern wasn't ordering your breakfast?  I was fucking around.  Was he fucking around, Eric?  I'm watching the show and listening.  I had both headphones on, which means I'm not listening to the room.  And something just gets thrown into my side.  And he's complaining about breakfast.  So I screamed at him.  I'm like, I don't care.  And that, as much debate as we had, Eric, I believe you about not caring about that.  I really don't. 
[03:46:00]  There's other times, especially during the 10 o'clock show, when comments will be made.  And Paul's back here and he's saying something.  Or he's like, no, that's wrong.  Or going off about something.  I'm like, go in there and he won't go in there.  He's always got an opinion, though.  Yeah, he's always got something.  So, I mean, he's good to talk to.  He just won't go in there and say anything.  But when he's sitting here in front of the mic, he just sits there like a big lummox.  Yeah.  Won't say anything.  Maybe he's a Brad Michaels bandana.  He does wear a bandana and has long hair.  This is Paul, by the way.  He screens the calls for us.  And you were flipping off Troy. 
[03:46:30]  I did flip off Troy.  Why?  You wrote Dan Yellen?  I was laughing about it.  Yeah, no, I was laughing about it.  Because when he was a screener, he spelled plenty of things wrong.  Yeah, but he also did a lot of other stuff.  What else do you do?  Oh.  Oh, shit.  Well.  That's a tough question.  That is a tough question.  Well, it's an easy question.  Not much.  Yeah.  You know my situation here.  Well, I mean, you don't ever make an effort to ever try to do anything.  That's not true at all.  What have you done?  I've asked to do plenty of things.  Like what?  Like a production, pulling stuff for E-Rock. 
[03:47:00]  I've offered plenty of times.  Like production.  You said one since you've been here doing this.  You've said one production thing to me, and I've never heard it done.  Which one?  You're like, oh, I'm going to do a production piece with you about phone screening.  And I was like, okay.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  It sounded too much like an old one, so I didn't do it.  So come on with a new idea.  I had a Bobo piece that I was working on with Travis, and that fell through because it  was supposed to be done for the Oscars, and Bobo never showed up in time to do it.  Oh, okay.  Okay. 
[03:47:30]  I've been trying to write other things.  So you had ideas for our stuff?  I had ideas for stuff that I put effort into, and then they didn't pan out.  Okay.  Well, great.  I mean, nothing's made it on the air, though.  So I mean, it's...  You're right.  It hasn't.  Okay.  That is where it speaks loudly.  I mean, you know, you can...  Nothing...  What's the furthest along the process that something's gotten?  Has anything gotten past the note-taking stage?  Yeah.  Anything past the writing stage? 
[03:48:00]  Yeah.  I got a script approved, and it made it all the way right to being recorded, and then  the person who was supposed to come record it just never showed up.  Bobo?  Yeah.  So you didn't try to reschedule?  It was time-sensitive, and we couldn't get it done in time.  Okay.  Giants can back me up on that, too.  Do you think you put in as much effort as you could?  No.  And what forbids you from pulling things for EROC?  I have time constraints.  I have to leave by a certain time. 
[03:48:30]  Well, I don't have to leave, but I'm not...  You're not forced to leave.  I'm not allowed to work past a certain number of hours.  No, you can work.  You just can't bill them for that work.  Yeah.  So, they're not at the door like, all right, dude, go.  Get the fuck out of here.  That's true.  You could easily go, y'all stay and make sure this gets done.  Cool.  So you don't do extra work because you can't bill them?  Yeah.  So, I mean, what does that say about your...  I mean, you got fucking Sal who's here busting his balls for free, doing production.  Yeah. 
[03:49:00]  Like, the Danny bit that played on the air today...  Dude, Sal pretty much put that whole thing together.  Sal did how much?  Sal did.  I just tweaked what he did.  Yeah.  And he put it together with Danny.  So, you have an intern that's getting stuff played on the main show, and you as an employee  are not doing anything other than screening phone calls and bitching about your breakfast.  And then, second your time is done, like, getting the fuck out of here.  When I was an intern, I worked just as many hours as Sal.  Okay.  I was here as often as I could.  I busted my ass for free. 
[03:49:30]  I mean, you want to be a part of the show, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, I mean, you got to...  Be a part of the show.  Yeah.  I mean, I just don't know what your contribution is.  Well, right now, it's screening phone calls, and nothing I've done has made in on the air yet.  But don't you think you would get more done if you weren't paying attention to what you could bill for  and just saying, okay, I'll bust my ass now?  It's not like you haven't.  You interned.  Yeah.  But that's not to say you're finished paying dues.  I'm not finished paying dues.  No, I understand that.  I've been here for six years. 
[03:50:00]  I do understand that.  I mean, I'm not getting paid to talk to you right now.  I'm not billing anyone for my airtime.  He's not billing for Hits One.  He does a Hits One show.  He's not getting fucking paid for the Sam Roberts show on Sundays.  I mean, it's not about me.  I don't think any of us are punching clocks at this point.  No.  Technically, we get paid for, what, eight hours?  Technically.  But we don't punch a clock.  But I mean, I come in and work on a Sunday and do my liquid metal show and do other stuff  while I'm here.  Yeah.  I don't get paid.  I'm not booking them for overtime. 
[03:50:30]  You just got to fucking do it, dude.  It's the world we live in.  I think everybody can relate to that.  I mean, especially people in creative environments.  If they want to get to the next level, it's not about, you know, I'll do what you pay me  for because I'll just pay somebody else to do it who will do a little more.  Yeah.  It's about being the guy who will actually do the quality job, I think.  And it's hard to pay for more when there's an intern that's doing way more and he's not  getting paid anything.  Yeah.  And when I've offered to do the same things you've asked him to do, I never hear from  any of you.  Because you don't, it's always an issue and you don't want to stay later. 
[03:51:00]  It's never been an issue.  You're screening phone calls now during the day.  That's not true.  I'm actually told to leave from in the back office.  And then.  That's why I'm here.  And then fuck, it makes fun of me until I walk out.  You don't ask anybody else after you're done.  When you're getting made fun of, you're just sitting around.  You're not doing anything.  That's true.  And I've offered to do things while back there.  Yeah, but it's not.  You've been there.  You've seen it.  It's not a matter of saying, can I do something?  Like, you don't, that's not how people get things done.  I ask if you have anything you need.  Yeah, I know.  But people, I didn't ask, do you have anything you need?  I found needs that were not being met. 
[03:51:30]  I've been trying that as well.  Or come up with an idea.  Right.  I've been trying that as well.  You hear something on the show.  I mean, dude, you hear these shows.  You have the ability to get the isolated tracks.  You have the ability to the sound effect libraries and music libraries of this entire place.  And you have access to the guys who can do the production.  Yeah.  I mean, you don't, I don't know how to do production.  You don't have to know how to do every single thing.  No, you just don't.  You have access to the people who do.  You go, I have this clip of Jim saying this.  I have this idea. 
[03:52:00]  What do we do?  Yeah.  How do we put this together?  Yeah, I understand that.  I mean, I haven't heard, you've said that one thing to me.  What else have you done?  Other things.  I've been pulling, I've sent Travis news clips and stuff and, you know, shit like that.  Normal stuff.  Okay, that's fine.  You know, I haven't actually built a production piece.  No, you don't have to build, but you can be proactive with trying to come up with some ideas.  You're right.  And you're not.  That's not true.  I mean, I've heard one.  You've heard one.  Okay.  Well, I mean, who does, who puts the production together here? 
[03:52:30]  You do.  Okay.  So why would you not come to me with other ideas if you had them?  Like, who are you going to go to?  I usually discuss them with Travis and Danny first.  Okay.  Well, they don't do sound production.  You're right.  But they've worked for the show longer and they were the guys I learned from.  So they're the ones I go to first with anything.  Do you think.  And Sam, of course, too.  That you have done, that you do enough to be considered, yeah, he's a guy.  Like, the way people get hired for the show is they're pretty much already doing what they're going to do. 
[03:53:00]  And then now you're actually working here.  You know what I mean?  Like, when I was an intern, I was already doing my job for free.  And they were like, okay, now we'll pay you for it.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Do you think that you're at that point?  No.  I think I'm doing what I'm getting paid for and then if it goes to the next level, then I was going to be doing more.  But how do you know that it would even go to the next level if you don't – if you've never proven yourself that you can handle the next level?  I have proven that I can handle the next level when I was an intern, which is why I'm here to be – 
[03:53:30]  Yeah, but you were an intern like how long ago?  2009, I believe.  So, you know.  It's not like my work ethic has gone down at all.  Says who?  I mean you just said you're not doing as much as you did when you were an intern.  That's true.  So then in three years, if you're doing less now, why would anybody assume that your work ethic has gotten better?  Because I'm being paid to do less is the only reason I'm doing less.  But I'm not – nobody around here has that attitude.  Except you.  I'm going like, oh, my time's done. 
[03:54:00]  Peace.  Like, I mean, are you – do you think that you are worthy of the next level?  Yeah, absolutely.  For what?  But what – because you can screen phone calls?  No.  Okay, here's how you should be thinking.  Not do you think you're ready.  Should other people think you're ready?  Like, based on what should somebody sit down and say, Paul's the guy?  If you haven't been the guy, why would somebody assume that you will be? 
[03:54:30]  Because I have been the guy.  Not necessarily.  Well, yeah.  I don't remember you being the guy.  You weren't working directly with the show though.  Okay.  So would I go to bat for you to be like, yeah, dude, this is the fucking man?  No.  I don't know you well enough to think you ever would, to be honest.  So wouldn't you think, though, you should try to get everybody to be like, yo, dude, Paul is the fucking man.  He's the one handling his shit for this place.  He's going above and beyond.  He's staying late.  He's making sure all the audio is cut up.  Anytime there's been something that needed to get done, like when Patrice passed away, I was here late working with Eric, cutting things until I had to leave because I had to go to my other gig. 
[03:55:00]  There's one other instance.  I know I stayed late working for Eric.  Okay.  So what time did you start?  What month did you start?  September?  Yeah, I think so.  Okay.  So from September till March, you can remember one time staying late to cut up audio?  No.  More than one.  That specifically sticks out in my head is the one time I stayed.  Twice.  Yeah, twice. 
[03:55:30]  We'll give you the benefit of the doubt.  I mean, dude, it's just...  Do you think it's a valid point or you don't think it's a valid point?  I think Troy has a valid point for what he's saying, but I disagree with him anyway.  Why?  Because I think his point of view is off.  Well, do you realize that sometimes you work hard, like you say you did in 2009, and then you're away from the scene?  And you don't just...  You don't get to take the points with you. 
[03:56:00]  Yes.  I...  You know what I mean?  I understand what you're saying.  Like when I was interning for the summer, if I'd gone back to Syracuse and then come back in May and said, remember how good I was last May?  They would have been like, yeah, but since then there's been other people.  You know, I don't...  Not really.  Yeah.  You know, I'm back to kind of square one.  Now, I had a foot in the door, which is what you have, but it doesn't mean...  I wouldn't have gotten credit if I hadn't been coming in consistently since then.  And, you know, I'm not saying you should have been coming in consistently. 
[03:56:30]  What I am saying is once you have the opportunity to be back in here, you know, they don't allow interns to come in and work for free anymore unless they're official interns.  Well...  So once you're in this building, I don't see any reason why...  And the fact that they're paying you for even one hour is exceptional based on a lot of the behaviors around here.  I don't...  In terms of people getting paid here. 
[03:57:00]  Oh, okay.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  You know, just the fact that you are getting paid hourly to screen calls should be enough that you'll do a full day's work  with the expectation that I can prove to them that I'm worth a full day's pay.  And if that doesn't happen, then I'll stop.  But not, I'll give you a full day's work when you give me a full day's pay.  Like, that attitude just doesn't work.  Yeah, because you've got an intern here that's fucking killing it in production.  And there will always be someone like that. 
[03:57:30]  Yeah.  Like, there's...  Killing it.  Killing it.  And where the bosses are looking at him going like, yo, this dude is fucking...  This dude knows what's up.  And it's like, who's Paul?  He's gone.  Oh, he's gone.  He's done.  You're not paying him for it anymore.  So he's peacing out.  There's no way you can prove to somebody that you have work ethic based on, you know,  I'm telling you that I have it and in 2009 I showed you.  Because, like, because Troy, you didn't know Troy, right?  I didn't.  I mean... 
[03:58:00]  So how do any of the bosses remember?  If Troy doesn't remember?  Fair enough.  You know?  And that's the perspective you should be looking through.  Not your perspective.  It doesn't really matter what me, Danny, Travis, or Troy for that matter think.  And it doesn't matter what you think of yourself.  If you're looking for somebody to pay you for a job, you should be looking at what their  perception of you is.  And that's the only thing that matters.  Because you have to prove to them that you're worth them giving you money to come in here 
[03:58:30]  and do a job that a lot of people want.  I mean, you know, when people find out that there's an open position on this show, people...  It's crazy.  Come out of the woodwork.  Yes.  Like, people you would never expect who work here already are saying, oh, oh, you know,  I heard somebody left the show.  I heard this and that.  Is anybody...  Are there any openings?  Blah, blah, blah.  It's a coveted position.  I understand that.  So, for there to be, you know, it just...  I don't think the attitude that you have does anything for you. 
[03:59:00]  You know what I'm saying?  No, I do.  I do.  You look confused.  Why is this confusing to you?  No, I'm just thinking about it.  Yeah.  Processing.  Yeah.  I mean, it's...  It's like a confusion.  It's just a little...  I mean, you've been here since September.  So, it's like...  I mean, you've got a lot of catch-up to do.  You know, you've got a lot of ideas that you really need to start trying to formulate  and put together and...  I've been working on it.  I have.  Since September.  Unless...  I mean...  Unless you just don't give a shit. 
[03:59:30]  And it's just like, whatever.  Because there's a certain...  There's something to be said for pride, too.  And, you know, if you don't want to work more than they'll pay you for because of pride,  I get it because I'm a prideful person, too.  But understand that that's not a tactic that works.  Yeah.  So, like, I would love to say, you know, I've proven myself on the air.  Fuck you guys.  I will go...  I will touch a microphone when you will pay me as if I was a host.  But I wouldn't say that because I know they'd be like, okay.  And then I'd never get on the air again. 
[04:00:00]  Yeah.  Because why would I?  Because why would they want somebody with that attitude when they know that they could  just train a new kid to come in here and basically do what I do?  Well, granted, it wouldn't be nearly as well, but they'd still get the job done.  Well, I'm also still a little gun shy about...  Because they make such a big deal about the number of hours I am here and everything else.  And because of the way my internship ended.  Well, I mean, bring shit home, then.  If you don't want to be...  I do shit from home.  I do, like, news stories and stuff I pull. 
[04:00:30]  Who's going to find you in this building if you're sitting in the office an hour after  you're supposed to finish?  Roland's sleeping in his office for most of the afternoon and nobody notices.  Yeah.  Like, who's going to find you and be like, Paul, you've got to leave?  Like, you filled out a timesheet, right?  They're very...  Yeah.  I've been...  I've done what you've done.  And I've done exactly that, where I've put that I've...  This is when I started.  This is when I ended.  But in reality, this is where I ended.  Is that how you started here?  You were interning and then you went to hourly employment?  Yes.  And even when I was an hourly employee, I would stay way past... 
[04:01:00]  I would come in on weekends and I would still just put down my normal hours.  Because it was like, well, you can't go over these hours.  Well, it's fine, but...  You've got to have people see your face.  Yes.  You have to see people see your face and you also have to have work that you're showing  them.  Like, boom.  There's nothing.  Boom.  And you've got this many hourly employees.  Well, I know Troy's a guy who will go above and beyond.  Right.  And honestly, to have that attitude as a fight all the way, you're still fighting to break  free of that illusion.  You know what I mean? 
[04:01:30]  It's hard to get to a point where you feel like you're treated fairly.  And it may never happen in this building, but it's still...  It may never happen in any building, quite frankly, because it's not like this place  is unique.  Right.  That's the way America is right now.  It's life.  It's the way maybe America's always been.  We haven't been in the workforce.  And you may never feel that you get the credit you deserve until you're retired.  Yeah.  And even then...  Right.  And even then, you should be like, I should have more...  Yeah.  More my backhand.  These fucking assholes.  Yeah.  So...  But, you know, but I don't think that saying, you know, I did a certain thing several years 
[04:02:00]  ago, so now...  Because we've had...  Well, no.  I'm just saying that's why I'm here now.  But so why should you be here past now, then?  If that's why you're here now, then those points have been accounted for.  So that's why you're here now.  So why do you get to the next level?  Now, since you've been here, have you been exceptional?  Do you think?  I've been mediocre at best. 
[04:02:30]  So then why are you here past now?  You don't have to answer, you know, I'm not your boss.  I'm just thinking.  Yeah.  I'm just thinking.  But I think...  Processing, I'm taking the criticism.  I think that's probably Troy's annoyment with you.  I don't...  I'm just sitting there, like, flicking me...  Like, yeah, we're cool in the hallway, but, like, you're flicking me off.  I'm going to say some shit to you.  And I'm like, fuck you, dude.  I was laughing at you when I did it.  It wasn't like I was being a dick.  No, it's fine.  But I'm just going to call you.  I'm going to say, what the fuck's up with that? 
[04:03:00]  Like, we're not...  Sam looks to the glass and flicks me off.  It's a different story.  Like, you flick me off.  I'm going to be like, what the fuck is your problem?  You know what I mean?  Like, that's just...  Because you don't have shit that you want to call me out on, I don't think.  No.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And I know that you're sitting back there talking shit, and you won't say anything on  the air.  Yeah, I don't talk shit back there.  Eric says you have an opinion.  Well, I do have an opinion on certain things.  Well, yeah, and that's about...  And I know, like, I don't think anybody who works on this show should have a vocal opinion 
[04:03:30]  about what's going on, especially on the after show.  You all, you, Paul, everybody has free reign in these microphones, and everybody knows that.  So anybody who has any vocal opinion about what's going on on this show should always  be in this studio.  Like, I don't see any...  This is time to air the Dirty 100.  Yeah, I think it's a total waste of time, and I can't believe that anybody would have  the energy to have an opinion on what's going on on this show, or the Opie and Anthony show,  you know, without saying it in here, because this is your opportunity. 
[04:04:00]  But that's my opinion on the matter.  Well, listen.  Yeah, Eric, sorry.  No, he does.  We're right.  Unfortunately, we're running out of time.  But, you know, there's time to...  And it's mostly during the 10 o'clock portion when he wants to chime in, he wants to say  something.  So he'll go off here in the back, and I tell him, I'm like, go in.  Go in and say something, then, because, like you just said, you know, if you ask or if  you're going to contribute, you have free reign on the microphone.  But he won't do it. 
[04:04:30]  I mean, it's a scarier situation, because you're actually going to have to defend your opinion  at times.  Well...  But if you're strong enough to have a vocal opinion on you...  It's just...  Yeah, that's fine.  It's what you do.  And I've told you plenty of times, go in there and say that, and you don't do it.  Well, I think what Eric is referring to is when we were talking to...  You were talking to Troy yesterday about that girl.  And I said, well, why don't we look up her Twitter and see what was so funny?  And he said, well, go and do it.  And I said, well, make sure Sam's cool with that, because I didn't want to just walk in  and do it.  No, because had you walked in there and he would have... 
[04:05:00]  And Sam would have said, what is he doing in here?  I would have popped on and said, I told him to go pull up the Twitter.  Well, regardless, that sounds semantics to me.  But as a general rule of thumb, I would say if you're confident enough to vocalize an  opinion, in general, not you, everyone, you know, just come in here and say it and defend  it.  Yeah, and get into it.  Yeah, it's fun.  That's what the whole point of this is for.  You know?  People like it.  You know, I like it.  You should like it.  It's getting your voice heard.  Yeah.  And fucking around and talking some shit. 
[04:05:30]  Exactly.  It's fun talking shit.  Talking a little shit, especially about those goddamn Toby Keith fans.  I hope you've learned something, Paul.  I have.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  They're going to be even more educational today than we were.  So tune in for that.  We'll be back with more of this tomorrow.  Goodbye, everybody.  Let's go low-cup.  I fill you up.
