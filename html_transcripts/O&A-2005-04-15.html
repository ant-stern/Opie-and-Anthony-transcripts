<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Anthony suffering from a debilitating toothache, exacerbated by a sleepless night and self-medication with Captain Morgan.  The hosts discussed various home remedies suggested by callers, alongside the blame placed on the "curse of the pickled punk" from a previous show.  This was followed by an extensive segment dissecting Bruce Kelly's incomprehensible promotional pieces for the show's "worst of" segment, eliciting numerous jokes and insults from Opie and Anthony, with callers chiming in on both the toothache and Kelly's work.  The show then featured a disastrous, yet humorous, interview with recurring guest Frenchie, focusing mainly on his erratic sleep and work schedule, and a brief, inappropriate anecdote from comedian Bob Kelly.

The broadcast continued with the hosts riffing on a disastrous listener suggestion, followed by a listener’s call about Anthony's peroxide mouthwash experiment resulting in copious foaming. This prompted a heated, profanity-laced confrontation with a caller, “Dragon Wagon,” an over-the-road trucker, who vehemently insulted the hosts, attacking their morality and professionalism. This exchange devolved into personal attacks targeting Dragon Wagon’s wife, sex life, and choice of radio station, punctuated by his repeated threats to complain to XM.  This argument continued intermittently throughout the segment, interspersed with D.D.’s traffic and sports updates (Yankees/Red Sox game, Sheffield incident), news reports (Paris hotel fire, French hostage, Brittany Spears and Michael Jackson), and Jimmy Norton's escalating headphone problems which ultimately silenced his participation.  The hosts also reviewed the poorly-received *Amityville Horror* remake, referencing Lou Luminick’s scathing review.

A chaotic segment followed, beginning with technical difficulties and then introducing Dee Dee, a movie producer, and the subject of "Lubricated in Lunacy." Dee Dee shared anecdotes about her Vegas wedding to a counterfeiter, encounters with the Secret Service, a relationship with a UPS driver, and teased a story about a disastrous date with a karate instructor. This was interwoven with discussions about the hosts' bowel movements and gas, a brief but un-interviewed appearance by Mindy from the Kids Channel, a baseball game involving Alex Rodriguez and a disputed Red Sox ticket, and professional wrestling (Hulk Hogan's patriotism).  Anthony's toothache continued to dominate, requiring multiple trips to the dentist upstairs, with live commentary and audio from his dental visits provided by the hosts and guest Patrice O'Neal. This segment also included discussions of Billy Joel's relapse and XM Satellite Radio ads.

The broadcast featured a heated exchange between the hosts, Vinny Brand (Stress Factory owner), and Patrice O'Neal concerning Patrice's poorly-attended and apparently troublesome performance at Vinny’s club. This included vulgar insults about Patrice’s weight, personality, and success, along with Patrice’s counter-insults and accounts of audience reactions.  Anthony detailed his negative dental experiences, leading to further vulgar banter and a discussion of health issues.  This was followed by a segment dedicated to playing and discussing offensive and graphic 1960s “trainable” audio tapes for intellectually disabled individuals, with further derogatory comments and jokes from the hosts and guests.  A call from D.D. about being hit in the head with nunchucks by a date concluded the segment, followed by more insults and jokes and a brief discussion about taxes and Jimmy Norton’s potential studio purchase.

The final segment began with a discussion about a man, Vinny, arrested for allegedly assaulting his girlfriend and causing a miscarriage.  The hosts responded with dark humor, crude jokes, and graphic descriptions. This devolved into vulgar banter, with mentions of Patrice O'Neal, Big Jay Oakerson, and an unnamed "very special guest" appearing at the Stress Factory.  The segment ended abruptly after more crude jokes, an apparent argument, and possibly a disagreement between the hosts and Vinny.

[00:04:30]  OKAY TERRIFIC  IT'S YOUR PROBLE YOU INSENSITIVE ASSHOLE  WANT ME TO TELL YOU SOMETHING MY CRUNK MICK FRIEND  STOP  I GOT NO WERE ELSE TO GO 
[00:05:00]  HA HA HA HA HA HA  HA HA HA HA  WHO TAUGHT YOU HOW TO DO THIS STUFF  YOU ALL RIGHT  I LEARNED IT BY WATCHING YOU  HA HA HA  Hey welcome to the OPIE & ANTHONY program  AYE  The O&A virus spreading across America  thanks for checking this out 
[00:05:30]  AYE  If you like what you're hearing  What you need to do is tell a friend.  Tell a friend that doesn't have XM.  That's how this thing is going to grow.  Ooh, I like my headphones today.  You do?  Yes.  Nice.  You seem all wide awake and chipper and ready to go, Anthony.  No, I'm not.  I'm telling everybody I'm phoning it in today.  Don't say that.  I'm phoning it in.  You don't tell people you're phoning it in.  You just phone it in. 
[00:06:00]  I've got to tell them in advance.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, my God.  No, see the...  Why did I make...  What the hell is that?  This is something I wrote yesterday.  I left here, and apparently someone tried to crumple it up,  because when you leave it and say no one touches, that's not enough.  Right.  So it's just a note for myself.  I apologize.  I didn't take the news.  Note to self.  Don't leave note to self here.  Why are you so far away from your microphone today?  I'm just settling in, listening to my friend over there who's having a bit of trouble.  I'm concerned.  Oh, I'm in utter...  You can't just call it in, though, Anthony.  Why? 
[00:06:30]  When you feel like crap, you've got to make believe you feel really good.  No.  And you get the listeners excited.  You trick them, and then you call it in.  It's so impossible.  Oh, my God.  Why did we make fun of dentists yesterday?  Why did we make fun of dentists?  I got, like, a dental curse.  I've been cursed.  A cap that I've had on for, I think, 15 years underneath.  Something to happen.  I started eating yesterday, and noticed, like, when I bit down, it really started to hurt. 
[00:07:00]  So I made an appointment for the dentist today, and it just got worse and worse to the point where last night I got no sleep.  No sleep.  I was like the elephant man trying to sleep sitting up, because the second I laid my head down, you feel your pulse in your tooth.  It's like...  Oh, just the pain.  And I was, I'm sitting up in bed, and I got a bottle of Captain Morgan, because I didn't have any Jack Daniels around the house. 
[00:07:30]  And I'm swigging that, and swishing it around by the tooth, and then spitting it out in a cup, because I didn't want to drink at 2 in the morning.  What is this, 1870?  Jesus.  Did they hold you down and do a little amputation as well?  What the hell's wrong with you?  Yeah, because there's so much dental care available at 2 in the morning.  You know how much stuff they got for pain nowadays?  Where?  Well, it's called a pharmacy.  Yeah, it was 2 in the morning.  It's called a drugstore. 
[00:08:00]  It was 2 in the morning.  Dude, to leave, those things will help with what you're going, you've got to take it before the show.  Oh my god, I got a medicine cabinet filled with stuff.  Yeah, leave, Tylenol PM to knock me out.  Stuff never seems to work for me.  Sleeping pills.  It's like aspirin.  It's all I've ever taken for pain.  So you were living like it was 1870, just swigging Captain Morgan.  I was trying to call the blacksmith so he could come over and pull my tooth out with some flyers.  What's the matter? 
[00:08:30]  Do you have a wooden denture sword?  Yeah, my wooden teeth.  Oh my god.  Just something going on underneath that cap.  I know what it is.  It's probably like a popcorn kernel.  Oh no.  That got like, you know, stuck underneath there.  No.  It's just pressing down hard on the nerve.  No.  Stop it.  That's actually how you do it.  You take like a little safety pin and you get in there and you just root around near the nerve a bit.  Holy jeez, shut up. 
[00:09:00]  Oh god.  Just straighten it out and start digging.  Anthony hates stuff like this.  Oh, this is just, and I can't wait to get there and have the dentist give that Novocaine.  Want to try this?  Oh, a paper clip?  I'll start rooting around in there.  Yeah, it's just a piece of food.  It might be some of that tuna fish you were eating yesterday.  There might have been a little bone in the tuna fish and it got stuck under the cap.  It's just tickling the nerve ending.  Just going.  I have those electric shocks coming out of my tooth right now. 
[00:09:30]  But then you go to the dentist and this pain, you know, you're in this utter tooth pain for hours and hours in a day.  And then they shoot you up with that Novocaine and in a second, it's pure relief.  You're complete, it's completely gone.  And then they, you know, fix you up.  So I am waiting for that like a heroin addict is waiting for his fix.  I am waiting, I'm looking at the clock going, when am I going to be there? 
[00:10:00]  When is she just going to take that needle and just shoot up the Novocaine and end the misery?  Oh, toothaches are just the worst.  A lot of people calling in now, Anthony.  Let's go to Paul on Long Island.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, I want to ask you something.  That tooth at the crown, was it looking out?  I believe it was.  So, because it has no nerve, so you must have an abscess or something under there now. 
[00:10:30]  That's wonderful, isn't it?  What's an abscess again?  It's sort of an infection that goes beneath the gum.  Yeah.  Oh, great.  And what you have to do is get some amoxicillin and Percocet and you'll be okay.  Yeah, there you go.  Well, they're going to, you know, pop the hood on that cap.  Pop the hood and take a look underneath.  Oh, you know what that might be, dude?  If you have some kind of an abscess, that's where they have to go through the rotted out  tooth and root around on the raw bone that's actually in the jaw.  Raw bone.  They have to scrape around on the bone itself.  I'll give you a raw bone. 
[00:11:00]  Being extra careful they don't hit another nerve down there.  Oh, yes.  Yeah, it's like a little farm of nerves.  It really is just awful.  Hey, you know, I didn't want to say it, but maybe I'll, you know what, I'll let Ben say  it from Jersey.  Ben, go ahead.  It's the curse of the pickle punk.  I told you.  I told you.  You didn't want to take him out of the bag yesterday.  That's what happened.  That's right.  You wanted the pickled punk to suffer in that box and I suffer staying in the safety.  No, that's what happened.  You let him out.  You asked, who let the punk out? 
[00:11:30]  I let the, who, who, who, who let the punk out?  I, I decided the pickled punk needed to breathe and see the light of day and you were the only  one that said no.  No.  You said no, leave it how it was.  Trapped in its little, uh, its little box.  Should have left him alone in there.  He was fine.  Are you starting to believe in the curse of the pickled punk?  Starting.  What do you mean starting?  I was never a disbeliever.  You were, uh, you, you didn't show the pickled punk any, uh, respect yesterday. 
[00:12:00]  You were talking bad about, uh, talking bad about dentists and now something that you  have not even worried about in 15 years just pops up like that overnight.  Oh, really is just the worst.  How the hell?  Oh.  I haven't had a toothache in years and years and years and years.  Well, let's go to Jason on Long Island.  Jason.  I don't remember and all I want is that needle.  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah.  Just make sure you remember how your fly is before you go under. 
[00:12:30]  It's a woman dentist, so that's fine.  She wants to pull my pants down.  Why not?  Who am I to deny her?  Yeah.  If you'll come back, you'll see that big delicious hog helmet just poking out.  You know, I got a great line that goes with the bit we did yesterday, but I don't feel  like saying it because I know it'll turn into a promo.  Uh-oh.  Why?  It's all right.  I'm starting to think now, you know?  You can't just blurt out stuff to be funny because then it turns into some homo promo.  Homo promo?  Homo promo. 
[00:13:00]  Remember how you were saying, you know, the horny dentist yesterday and how he has to,  you know, grab those, those tits?  Yeah.  Female dentist, you're in the chair.  Oh, you think she's going to be, I need that hog!  Exactly.  There you go.  Now that will be in the promo and not me saying it.  Why don't you chomp down on this a little bit?  That will help.  Yeah, let's give him some tinfoil.  What you do is you line all of your lower teeth with tinfoil and you wait for that metal  clank. 
[00:13:30]  Oh.  Stop it.  And while you're just chomping down on the tinfoil, we're going to bring in a blackboard  and write up some formulas with the chalk.  Now I got a banana.  Soft banana.  That was just brought to me that I can't possibly eat.  Why?  Even though it's a soft little banana.  It's a banana.  You mush it between your palate and tongue.  Yeah, but if it even touches it, it's just going to be murder.  A little clear stuff would really help.  Yeah.  Having to squeeze a little clear stuff on that sore area. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, maybe I should just swallow the banana whole.  Deep throat it.  Let's go to Dan.  Hey, Dan.  Hey, how you doing?  Pretty good.  Anthony's got a really, really bad toothache today.  Yeah, he had a root canal done on the tooth already.  I believe the root canal was done and a cap was put on it.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, you know, you probably have an apnea that's going on there.  You've got some leakage under the crown.  And now you need to do what's called an apico, where they chop off the end of the root, or you're  going to lose the tooth. 
[00:14:30]  Great.  Who cares?  Just put a bridge in there.  No, no, you need an implant.  Yeah, put an implant in.  I don't care.  Look, right now, I don't care what it is.  I just want it taken care of.  Well, let's see what Mike in Detroit has.  Mike?  Yeah, Ant.  Yeah.  Yeah, take a rinse with peroxide or a swig of that pickled punk juice.  No, but seriously, the peroxide will take care of you.  Oh, really? 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, yeah.  What'll that do now?  It's going to foam up.  I'll look like a rabid dog.  What's peroxide do, sir?  It kills the infection if it's an abscess in there at all.  If you look in the back of peroxide, it says oral rinse.  I've actually used it after brushing my teeth before I go to bed.  It's great stuff.  You know, we were on the road once.  I just, yeah, this brings up a memory.  I was on the road once with Jimmy.  It might have been Dallas or something.  And I went to his room to get him for whatever, dinner or something.  And he's in the middle of, like, you know, gargling with this stuff. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  He goes, no, it's really good for you.  You should try it.  So I tried it.  And just like you said, yeah, you foam like a rabid dog.  Rabid dog.  Give me some peroxide.  It's not fun.  It tastes like crap.  It's awful.  And it stings if you have any tiny little cuts in your mouth.  Yeah.  Maybe I should do that.  Yeah, absolutely.  It can't hurt.  All right.  Get one of our interns to go down to Duane Reade and get me some peroxide.  I'll do it in here so you can see my mouth foam.  Oh, it's awful. 
[00:16:00]  Tim in Massachusetts.  Oh, hey.  What's going on, man?  Hey.  Good morning, vaginal blood fart.  So that was very hurtful, and there's no need to talk like that.  It's early in the morning.  How are you?  Hey, Ant, why don't you go to weed like Opie was saying?  It always makes me feel better.  Smoke some weed.  If I smoked weed, I'd just be paranoid about going to the dentist.  All right, Ant, I hope you're ready for some Cracker Jacks.  Ricky's here.  Oh, no.  Ricky, the intern, is going to take this order.  Hey, Ricky.  I said before, I thought I did a good job getting your... 
[00:16:30]  Well, just try to get back here before Anthony's actual...  Sorry.  I was just going to say, just get back here before Anthony's actual dentist appointment.  That would be nice.  Yeah, sure.  That would be nice.  What I need is what is called hydrogen peroxide.  It's a little brown bottle.  Yeah, not hair dye peroxide.  Why?  What's wrong with that, Anthony?  Why don't you need that?  It's just, you know, the brown bottle of hydrogen peroxide.  Small, big, whatever size.  Does it matter?  No, I can't.  That's easy. 
[00:17:00]  Get them pain medication, too.  Some type of a pain thing.  Aspirin stinks.  Aspirin doesn't take away...  I don't take aspirin for headaches.  The miracle drug.  Yeah, it's awful.  It's awful.  What kind do you need?  Advil town?  What do you think is better, Aleve or Advil?  Aleve.  Aleve is stronger.  Aleve is great for pain.  All right, get Aleve.  Yeah, Aleve is pretty good.  Try some Aleve.  All right, cool.  I want to get Anthony all just, uh, woo today.  All woo, all fuzzy and stuff.  That can be dope.  Why? 
[00:17:30]  It's not dope.  It's a painkiller.  Let's go to Indiana and say hi to Chris.  Hey, Chris.  Hey, what's up, ONA?  What's up, buddy?  Hey, it's in the teeth, Bob.  It's in the teeth, Bob.  Twelve monkeys.  Very good.  That's very funny.  Oh, hell yeah, fellas.  All right, thanks, Chris.  All right, Bob.  All right, Bob.  All right, well, we'll take care of that, Anthony.  Yeah, please.  We do have a lot of show to do today, so.  I got Aurigel. 
[00:18:00]  I got Aurigel and Ambosol.  People are calling in and writing saying I should.  Did you try the Ambosol?  I tried the Ambosol.  Saul?  That works for maybe .03 of a second.  What about the Aurigel?  I'll try it.  Yeah, the Aurigel might help a little bit.  Oral pain reliever.  See, that's where you and I are so different.  Why?  If I had what was going on, I would be calling in going, I just can't.  I can't do this.  I wanted to.  Because I need my sleep and I need no pain to do this radio show.  And I hadn't either. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, you didn't sleep at all last night and you got a really, really bad toothache.  No sleep.  I love it.  Every day we have an excuse why we just call it in.  Yesterday was a good show.  I listened to the replay.  Yesterday's show was one of the best shows we've done since coming to XM Satellite Radio.  Can I have the scissor, Ben?  Please.  All right.  I've got to open up my Aurigel.  I had a weird moment yesterday as you opened that up.  What happened?  I was in the park, you know, doing my skating like I do almost every day.  And I'm just kind of sitting, hanging out, checking out the scenery. 
[00:19:00]  And Peter Jennings walked by.  Oh, sick.  Sick.  It looked like he was walking with maybe his kids.  Or he has a very young wife.  I don't know.  But the woman was kind of holding on to Peter and the kid was kind of following as well.  Not kids.  You know, they're grown children, whatever.  He's walking real slow with sunglasses.  And we make eye contact.  It was just one of those things.  He didn't recognize me or anything like that. 
[00:19:30]  I'm not going to go down that road.  So I'm like, oh, man, I've got to say something to Peter Jennings, you know.  So, you know, he's fighting this cancer.  Which, by the way, after seeing him yesterday, not a chance in hell he's going to beat it.  Not a chance in hell.  Not only that, I think he'll...  I hate to say it, but not only that, I don't think he's going to make it to the end of the year.  No way.  Is that what you said to him in the park?  Yeah.  No.  Boosted his spirits?  The only thing I could think of, you know, on the spot was, good luck, bro. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, my God.  Good luck, bro.  You said good luck, bro, to Peter Jennings, the most articulate newsman out there.  And that's all I could come up with.  It's not Dennis Hopper, stupid.  Right.  What do you say when someone's, like, he's, he's walking, he's walking by, he's walking 
[00:20:30]  by really slow, trying to get as much fresh air as possible.  Yeah.  Looking really bad.  His skin looks horrible.  And I'm like, I've got to say something.  So, I got one of these, you know, cancer bracelets on for, you know, Brother Weez.  So, I quickly, I forgot that part.  I quickly, like, you know, showed him my cancer bracelet.  Yeah.  And went, good luck, bro.  Like, we have something in common, you know.  Yeah.  Oh, it was just awful.  Oh. 
[00:21:00]  What?  Did he stop to read the bracelets?  No.  No, but everyone has these cancer bracelets now.  Everyone knows what they are.  Everyone?  No, I don't know what that is.  Hmm.  And then I decided to play a song for him as I was sitting there and, sitting there on  the park bench.  Oh, this is a good song.  Hmm. 
[00:21:30]  It's the cancer song.  Oh, no.  This is a miserable song.  A miserable version.  It's great.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  This is horrible.  You don't like this?  We're just pressing.  It's the type of song you want to sit in your computer chair and just cry alone to.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Somewhere over the rainbow. 
[00:22:00]  What the F?  This guy didn't like yesterday's show.  Hey, Tim, what's up?  What's up, Opie?  What up?  Man, y'all, so they're lacing your marijuana with cracks, man.  Yesterday's show was not the best you've ever done, dude.  I didn't say it was the best.  It was one of the better ones since we came to XM Satellite Radio.  Are you serious, man?  Tippy Tom and Golden Barns was the best show you have ever did, man.  That was the most hilarious shit I've ever heard in my whole life.  That's the exact reason why I keep XM, man.  This is the only, you know, station I turn to. 
[00:22:30]  Well, I can't really argue that point.  We got to get Tippy Tom back in here.  Let me tell you another thing, man.  You gave me a royal fucking on that worst of.  They played the same shit over and over and over just at different times, man.  I did not hear it.  You didn't have no Tippy Tom clips.  You didn't have Jim Norton banging nobody or going off on them.  You didn't have interns trying to get blowed or anything.  I mean, it was fucked.  All they played was that goddamn shit where it's like them 60s trainable sessions, man.  Well, I'm not going to argue that point. 
[00:23:00]  What happened was we gave a lot of bits for the worst of, and then Washington, they wanted  to play it really, really safe for the first week off premium, so they said no to a lot  of bits.  So then they had to make up the time, so they took some of the other bits and replayed them  a lot.  Man, that's the reason I called, man.  That's what I wanted to hear, because I know y'all couldn't have been behind that shit,  because it was fucked, man.  Oh, no.  We worked on the worst of them for like two weeks before we went on vacation, and there  were a lot of bits they said no to.  They just didn't want to go down that road right away, first week off the premium, unfortunately. 
[00:23:30]  So then they had to fill it up, so they played Larry the Cable Guy a million times, Tony  Danza a million times, a bunch of other things a million times.  No shit.  I didn't know, man.  Dude, it's good to talk to you, man.  I surely enjoyed this shit, brother.  Oh, thanks.  What did you think of Bruce Kelly and those interloculars, or whatever you called them?  Man, that shit.  I mean, it was good, but after you heard Raquel talking about donkey socks, just for about  the 500 fucking million times.  Yeah, we haven't really discussed this yet. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, I mean, I haven't heard nobody calling it, man, but it stunk, man.  I mean, I'm telling you, I had to turn the fucking radio off.  I was sick of hearing that.  Yeah, that's what a lot of people said.  They got sick of hearing the same thing 20,000 times.  Yeah, it stunk, man.  All right, well, we're back.  Tim, I think as we go to break, we're going to play that from yesterday, because that  was just classic.  Absolutely classic.  Awesome, man.  Y'all keep up the good work, dude. 
[00:24:30]  I'm punching out, man.  All right, there he goes, Tim.  Proving that we do have truckers that like us, the Dragon Wagon, or whatever the hell  that guy's name was from yesterday, thought all truckers hated us just because he doesn't  like us.  Yeah.  We have plenty of trucker fans.  Well, we do have those interloculars, or whatever they were called.  Interloculars?  The Bruce Kelly production?  Oh, those are good.  Huh?  Is that even a word?  Didn't he call it interloculars or something like that?  Interloculars, yeah.  What the hell is interloculars?  It's like a line from Bananaphone.  The interlocular? 
[00:25:00]  Interlocular.  Where are those?  Ring, ring, ring, ring.  We got them right there.  We got them right here?  You want to hear some of these, Anthony, really fast?  Oh, yeah.  I want to hear it, because people were just bitching and complaining that...  Well, we had the worst of.  You know, we were on vacation for two weeks, and a bunch of the bits, Anthony and I and Jim  Norton, we introed ourselves.  By the way, you know, every day at 6 a.m. on the East Coast, we have an hour of worst of,  but there's new material in there, because we're setting up all the bits and getting really  silly and stupid.  Yeah.  But, Washington thought it would be a good idea to have, like, Bruce Kelly, who we like, 
[00:25:30]  by the way, does a morning show on the 80s channel, kind of help out with the production  and interview some of the cast members, and then he was just getting wacky with some  really strange production that half the stuff I didn't even get.  I didn't really understand what he was going for.  This was his moment to shine, Opie.  All right, well, let's play...  In his inimitable fashion.  Let's play the first one here. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, any time.  O and A.  How do you tell which one is Opie and which one is Anthony?  Uh, Anthony's...  Oh.  Well, obviously, it's Opie, because he sounds hairier than Anthony.  The worst of O and A.  What?  All right.  All right.  What?  Did I hear that right?  Hold on.  Was that cut up or something?  Hold on.  Yeah, no, that's how it played.  I love that one. 
[00:26:30]  I don't really get it.  I sound hairier?  What?  Of course, since you're blonde and Nordic, and you are the Italian.  What is...  What does that mean?  I don't know.  I really don't know.  Well, let's try the next one.  Maybe it was just...  You know what time it is for me all day long?  Huh?  2.30.  Club Soda Kenny joke.  2.30.  All right, I want to hear the next one as you open up your...  My peroxide.  Your peroxide.  Club Soda Kenny didn't understand why that was funny, though.  He just thought it was funny because it was a before three time. 
[00:27:00]  All right, here we go, Anthony.  Here's the next one.  Opie and Anthony in the XM food chain are somewhere between the CEO and the lady who cleans the urinals.  And she's really nice, but they're...  Opie and Anthony are finally free on XM202 High Voltage. 
[00:27:30]  Thank you.  XM Satellite Radio.  XM Satellite Radio's Bruce Kelly here with another Opie and Anthony interlocking.  Opie and Anthony.  Isn't everybody in a company between the CEO and the woman who cleans the toilets?  Yeah, that's why that doesn't make sense.  It's like everybody.  That was kind of a weird compliment because it's like we're in between the biggest guy at the company, Hugh Pinero, and the lady that cleans toilets.  Yeah.  So how does that...  What?  It makes no sense. 
[00:28:00]  There's another one he has that's pretty funny.  It's Opie and Anthony inhale and their lungs fill with oxygen, and then they exhale.  All right, well, maybe they got better as we go along here.  Let's try this one.  Opie and Anthony are finally free.  That's the strength of our country.  Yay!  Now, back to the roost of Opie and Anthony.  Okay, look.  Oh, I don't get it. 
[00:28:30]  That was a good one, though, because it had bush in it.  It made it good.  All right, well, okay.  Let's try the next one.  XM Satellite Radio, celebrating the first free week of O&A.  Whoops.  Sorry.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony are overpaid.  But then again, so is Bob Edwards, the XM PR ghoul.  Oh, yes. 
[00:29:00]  The virus is now free.  Opie and Anthony.  What's wrong, Jim?  I don't know.  I've never seen you put your head down like that.  It's all these things that are apparently being knocked over and broken and then never explained.  It's beyond anything.  I'm dumbfounded here to even make a statement about this. 
[00:29:30]  I'm glad we're going down this road, because I was listening to a lot of the worst of, and I was like, what?  Ramone, define interlocular.  All right, do we have the next one?  Okay.  Opie and Anthony.  Yes, Opie and Anthony.  We're very, very proud to have them part of the XM family. 
[00:30:00]  That isn't you putting the cricket on.  That's all that's coming out for right now.  Anthony, he smells better, even on the radio.  Opie.  What?  He is trying so hard for something.  We like the guy.  We like Bruce Kelly.  He's got to call the show.  Yeah, let's get him on the phone and explain these one by one. 
[00:30:30]  And every time we don't like the explanation, he loses a toe.  We stand here with garden shears and lop off a digit.  All right, well.  It's making me forget about my toothache.  That's good.  It's another pain just listening to these.  Well, this was the first impression that all the new listeners got.  Are there more of these, Opie?  Just a few more.  Oh, good, good, great.  Hit the next one.  Called someone a fart knocker.  Hey, fart knocker.  Wash my own mouth out with soap on that one.  What is a fart knocker? 
[00:31:00]  I don't know.  Dirty word.  Dirty word.  Nice work, Logan.  Satellite radio.  Now, back to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Nice work, Logan.  Why?  Because Anthony said fart knocker, so he's trying to say that it was a bad hire?  All I know is the next time I hear Bruce Kelly talking, I want an Arab on each side of him with a rifle pointed at his head. 
[00:31:30]  Jesus.  Heidel from New York.  Bruce Kelly's the anti-Steve C.  Does he wear water clothing?  That is funny.  Wait till you get to the guy singing the O and A theme song.  Oh, boy.  Is there one of those?  Is there?  All right, let's go to this one first, then.  We got to find that one.  Hit it.  O and A. 
[00:32:00]  I sound like Bruce.  Yes, he happens to be a dwarf or midget.  And then you have Opie and Anthony, who are the sweetest, kindest, most gentle, sincere.  They're assholes, and they know it.  Opie and Anthony are finally free on XM202 High Voltage.  Okay, got it.  Check this.  One, two, three.  Yeah, thank you.  Hey, hey. 
[00:32:30]  Yee-haw.  You're a funny man.  No.  I'm hearing angels.  A wacky whistle.  There was a, I heard, I heard a wacky whistle.  Not used in, you know, sarcastic wacky fashion.  It was really used.  All right, we found the O and A theme song.  Ooh.  Let's hear this one.  The virus is now free.  Yeah, sure, I know the Opie and Anthony theme song. 
[00:33:00]  One, two, three.  Opie.  Anthony.  The guy Jim.  Opie.  Anthony.  The guy Jim.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Stop it!  Stop it!  What's the problem?  It's better than Green Acres.  Quiet. 
[00:33:30]  This looks like Taz's desk.  I'm having a promo ready.  Celebrating the first free week of O and A.  I've heard worse.  Something tells me it's not true.  Opie and Anthony interlocular.  What?  I don't get it at all.  Messier than Taz's desk.  And by the way, when you heard Jim Norton laughing, that was us live in the studio because  Anthony made that promo funnier by playing the clip.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Stop it!  Stop it!  People are going to get confused and think that was in there, which would make that funny, 
[00:34:00]  by the way.  It wasn't.  It was Anthony pushing it while clutching his jaw with one hand and pushing the Schwarzenegger  clips with the other.  I can't make it stop.  It's so bad.  I can't make it stop.  Let's go to the next one.  That same feeling you have in your tooth now, there's a lot of people out there driving  with that feeling in their ears.  Hit it.  No. 
[00:34:30]  I don't get it.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  I'll warm up the car.  Mr. Gun.  What?  Warm up the car?  Then get in it.  And don't forget to seal off the window so that the exhaust fumes don't exit the vehicle.  Rev from Wackbag says, where's the bucket of things that don't work? 
[00:35:00]  Kaplunk.  Kaplunk.  Kaplunk.  I, um, let's, well, let's hear the one about hairstyles.  I remember hearing this one on the air.  Go ahead.  O and A.  Well, as far as Opie's hairstyle, it's more Owen Wilson.  And Anthony, um, Anthony is more Burt Convy.  The worst of O and A.  Huh?  How old are you that you make a Burt Convy reference? 
[00:35:30]  Burt Convy?  Oh, my God.  Wow.  That isn't easy.  He's on the 80s station.  That isn't even an 80s reference.  That's a 70s reference.  And an early 70s reference.  Jesus.  Wasn't he on, like, Tattletale or something?  He was the host.  He was the host of one of those dumb game shows?  Tattletales.  It's just awful.  All right, well, let's, uh, let's, let's, uh, let's try this one here. 
[00:36:00]  Ah.  We got it all on tape, that guy.  Yay!  Now, back to the worst of Hopi and Anthony.  Audio news ring.  I'm going to make so much money off these assholes.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  highly underpaid 
[00:36:30]  there's a theme in all this production  i think he's a little jealous of us  a little jealous of us and the attention we're getting  either that or he's working with uh...  see we have a three sound effects the change  the water dripping into a like bucket  okay two sound effects he's working with we have a very unique way of abusing  each other that comes across in a very special way  yes but he he doesn't  he doesn't have that talent  i don't get it i don't get it all wait the one thing i'll say that i'm one 
[00:37:00]  promo  can you play the beginning of that problem please stop it not good my god  not just for the last  he's a couple laps in there but i mean that there's one  get  you stop it  that's a great  audience that we've been looking for that's the studio audience laugh we need  well let me hear it again  yeah because we have been looking for that clip  ah  yeah that'll help  it's clear it's clean  let's uh... uh...  sand let's get on that and find it  all right let's go to the next piece 
[00:37:30]  people have been wanting us to play these by the way  mark that and dilette  believe it or not because they they didn't get it either  they were like what was going on in between the worst of bits  yeah  go ahead  o and a  yeah  opie and anthony are overpaid but  you know then again so is  they are really lucky to have a job  the worst of o and a  then again so is they are really lucky to have a job  and then you know the thought process for more than like a second 
[00:38:00]  was trying to abuse us which is fine we could take it but  there's also a very  there's a jealousy thing that's coming through loud and clear through these  production pieces  what do you think he's he's pulling down here at xm  i'd say uh... fifty  you think about fifty  no  no  more than that  i don't know  runs the eighties channel right  yeah he can make it more than that  i'd say he's making two or three million  fifty four  two or three million  are you insane  the eighties channel is a huge success on xm  are you insane 
[00:38:30]  oh here's the donkey sausage tea bag  yes they played this one about a hundred times while we were on break  ooh  let's listen to this  is it a good one ope?  no  it's awful  it's really bad  now for those who find humor in sadism  then  to some  strange odd group of people i guess  it's funny  quite frankly i would love to be tea bagged by donkey sausage  did you hit pause there?  it would be an anthony show  isn't that impossible? 
[00:39:00]  yeah  donkey  donkey sausage is a  a chick  yeah  does he even know what tea bagging is?  what?  oh he elaborates on that?  oh sorry guys  the bruce kelly fan club inside  is pissed off  you just don't get it man  you don't listen to bruce  you don't get bruce  oh he's gonna explain  alright let's go  i do want to say one thing though  is there something  did they ever just think to go  alright let's just redo that  it was never  this is like an ed wood thing 
[00:39:30]  yeah  but look i tripped on my lines  and i lost all humor value  it's perfect let's move on  cut  perfect  perfect  alright let's uh... let's continue  uh... quite frankly i would love to be tea bagged by donkey sausage on the Opie and Anthony show  um... well she's a girl  she can't tea bag me  okay  but you never know with these guys  oh yes  the virus is now free  Opie and Anthony are finally free 
[00:40:00]  on XM202  oh  high voltage  oh my god  they just won't  they won't leave that stuff alone  what  what  what stuff  what  what are you trying to say  what are you trying to say  you're gonna make me weep openly  what is that mean  what does it mean  he screws up by saying the whole donkey sausage thing  the tea bagging 
[00:40:30]  right  then he says oh that's a  she's a girl  and then  but then you never know with Opie and Anthony  you never know with Opie and Anthony  what does that mean  she still needs a dick  and then  well balls actually  and why would he want to be tea bagged  then if she did have a dick and balls and  and then  and then what's that other stuff that was thrown in at the end  horrible  i don't know that one wasn't that bad  it kinda had like a whole thing  donkey sausage thing  which i thought was pretty cool  shut up  apparently the other interns are big fans of it out there 
[00:41:00]  dude wait you didn't get to the funny part yet  there's only a couple more here  oh  maybe three  i don't know let's see  play them slow let's enjoy them  go ahead  O and A  Opie and Anthony have approximately 127 people  to make the show happen  and that doesn't include the asswipe  that doesn't include the asswipe  the worst of O and A  okay terrific 
[00:41:30]  so you didn't get that one  no  can you explain that  try it again you'll get it  no  No, no, no, no.  You missed something in there.  O and A.  Opie and Anthony have approximately 127 people to make the show happen,  and that doesn't include the asswipe.  Hi-ya!  Me, me, me, ah!  The worst of O and A.  See?  What he's saying there is that this show has, like, well over 125 people, 
[00:42:00]  and there's asswipes, too.  And, like, they were not even included in that final count.  See?  Oh, now it's hysterical.  Okay, I get it.  And the punching sound.  Yeah, and then punching noises.  Why the punching noises?  It makes no sense.  You know what would have been a good promo for O and A?  Yeah.  You play that awful Terry Schiavo, and you go, you hear the zipper noise,  and you go, here, shut up, bitch. 
[00:42:30]  And the sound of mule being sunk in mouth.  Opie and Anthony.  At least you would get a reaction.  Of course.  Who wouldn't laugh hearing that?  All right, let's go to the next one.  I would.  What's wrong?  Hawk.  O and A.  Somebody let him out of the cage!  If I was to take a drug that would get me through four hours of the Opie and Anthony virus,  it would have to be a morphine drip, a bong loaded with Leepra Milch and ice cubes, 
[00:43:00]  a dilaudid suppository, and all the pixie sticks I could snort, and a nicotine patch,  and Preparation H, just for good measure.  Opie and Anthony are finally free on XM202 High Voltage.  This is what Bruce is like when he's sitting in on the show, too. 
[00:43:30]  Right.  You know, when he comes in, sits down in front of the mic, he just goes off like this.  He's a big fan of the show, but...  I understand.  But it doesn't really have a place with this show.  I disagree.  I think the last one, because it listed a bunch of drugs...  Proven, by the way, that no one is running the channel, but we're making changes as far as that goes.  Yeah.  Because there's no way anyone would have approved this production.  Uh-huh.  Right?  I doubt it.  Because don't you think someone would have sat down with these production pieces and went, 
[00:44:00]  well...  They don't really fit the show.  They don't fit the show.  They don't really get the point across about Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  There's no real humor value in this stuff.  There's no real humor value.  You're using the same sound effects over and over again.  They came to me and said, what do you think?  And I like them.  There's no chain of thought.  That's funny, that last one.  I mean, thank you, Bruce, and all.  Yeah, he tried.  He tried.  Goodness.  Can we play the drug one again, Opie?  No, no, no.  That's okay.  That was a pretty funny one. 
[00:44:30]  No, no, no.  That was way too long.  No, guys.  I swear to God, we got two left.  We got this one and one more.  Go ahead.  We got it all on tape, big guy.  Merci beaucoup.  Et après prochain.  This is the worst of O&A.  On!  XM's high voltage to O2.  Mm-hmm.  Pretty straightforward.  Yeah, that one wasn't offensively awful.  All right.  It was nothing, though. 
[00:45:00]  You want to accomplish something with this production.  Yeah.  Radio school.  Hit it.  O and A.  How do you tell which one is Opie and which one is Anthony?  Oh, that's easy.  It's Anthony.  Because he smells better.  Even on the radio.  Opie.  The worst of O&A.  Oh, my God.  All right.  There's no reason to kill the guy.  It's self-explanatory. 
[00:45:30]  He stinks.  Horrible.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  What's wrong?  Kelly's Plinko chip fell into the zero.  Oh, my God. 
[00:46:00]  Well, thank you, though.  Thanks for helping us out, I guess.  Thanks for helping us out, I guess.  Thanks for taking the three minutes in the studio to really think out what you said.  At least he lowered expectations, so now people are like, wow, these guys are a lot better than I thought they were.  That's true.  Wow.  Wait a minute.  What about the interviews?  I heard the interviews were really funny and really interesting with a lot of the...  Come on, dude.  We don't want to...  What were the other shows? 
[00:46:30]  I'm telling you, he had...  We don't want everyone turning off the show.  I heard an interview with Frenchie.  I was captivated by it.  It was great.  He's talking to these extra people.  Stop, dude.  We really do have other things to do today.  Like what?  People have been encouraging us to play those, because they didn't get it either.  A lot of email on the production.  Yeah.  You really want to hear the Frenchie thing?  It's long.  Oh, no.  It's great, though.  It's really interesting.  It's really funny.  This one I heard about...  What, Ben?  I'm with Jim.  The Frenchie stuff is great.  I can't...  Hold on.  All right, go ahead.  No, the Frenchie and Earl stuff is great. 
[00:47:00]  Are you kidding?  I didn't hear the Earl stuff.  I just heard Frenchie interviewed.  All right, let's...  And I'm like, this is actually really interesting and funny.  Here's the other thing that Bruce did, and he did an okay job with this stuff.  I don't know.  I didn't hear the Frenchie.  I heard any of it.  It's great.  I actually enjoyed this stuff.  I thought it was, you know, to hear Earl trying to explain what the show is about.  All that stuff was good.  The production pieces were just awful.  No, they were all right.  And they didn't accomplish anything.  They really didn't.  He was trying to be, like, one of the guys, because we spend all morning just smashing  each other in the face, and it just didn't come across well. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  Well, a little off the mark.  A little off the mark, right here.  All right, here we go.  Here's the Frenchie interview.  Frenchie is a legend on the ONA virus.  Yes, this is me, Frenchie, and I'm not a virus, but I am quite funny when I want to be.  How did you become part of the ONA virus?  Well, it was, what, six, seven years ago when the guys was in the WNW. 
[00:48:00]  I called up one day, and I wanted to do Cook Some Rats for Survivor Show when the first  Survivor Show came out.  Cook Some Rats?  Yes, some guy brought some live rats, and I called up.  Are you a legitimate chef?  Yes, I am.  I'm a French chef in a French restaurant on the Upper West Side.  Cordon Bleu?  Not Cordon Bleu, but it's a bistro restaurant, but I trained in France, yes.  You were a legend on the Opie and Anthony show, and so far on XM, I hear, you've bombed. 
[00:48:30]  How come?  Well, the reason, one of the reasons is because they're there in the morning from 6 to 10, and  I work nights.  They now have new hours, 7 to 11.  7 to 11, yes.  That's a little bit better, but the thing is, I work from 2 to 11 o'clock.  Now, choke yourself!  Don't pull my fucking hand over there!  I said choke yourself!  I don't get up before 12 or 11.  What's the difference between Opie and Anthony on 60 FM?  I can't just stand by as this goes on and on. 
[00:49:00]  Are we listening to what time Frenchie wakes up?  Is that what the interview is?  Yeah, yeah.  Where he works?  Yeah.  Why?  It's his schedule.  He works till 11.  When I get up.  Right.  Look at Ben.  That is...  I've never seen Ben laugh harder.  He's hiding way over in the corner, losing his mind.  And his head still pokes on behind the scenes.  You see that?  Oh, man.  When Ben gets laughing, it is the best. 
[00:49:30]  Because Ben just loses his effing mind.  That is the worst interview I've ever heard.  Well, let's see what he has for breakfast.  You're actually missing something.  You're actually missing a good point.  Shut up, Jim.  Well, it's good.  It gets good here.  Ben, why are you laughing so hard?  I just think it's funny.  Well, half the reason...  I think it's funny is because Frenchie calls me up during this whole thing.  He goes, oh, he's telling me how great his appearance was and how he hurt himself and how he wants to tape it.  I just think it's funny because Frenchie's just bombing.  It's awful.  I know, but that's what's funny about it. 
[00:50:00]  It is horrible.  A horrible interview.  It's terrible, but Frenchie was all proud of it.  Bruce trying to make something of this.  Really?  11 o'clock, 11.30 at night.  By the time I go home, I stay up to 2 o'clock in the morning and go to sleep.  I don't get up before 12 or 11.  What's the difference between Opie and...  Look at that and just listen to his mind.  We have Frenchie's schedule.  Now everybody knows what Frenchie's schedule is.  Oh, man. 
[00:50:30]  Anthony on Stinky FM and Opie and Anthony now on XM.  Well, they went totally level up.  They actually went...  They're doing actually what they wanted to do for the longest time since I've known them.  Since I know them.  Since I know them.  Since I know them.  Oh, my God.  Where are the goose-stepping Nazis when you need them?  Opie and Anthony on Stinky FM and Opie and Anthony now on XM.  Well, they went totally level up.  They actually went...  What?  They went totally level up.  They were doing actually what they wanted to do for the longest time since I've known them. 
[00:51:00]  They get to say everything.  Since I know them.  Since I've know them.  Since I've know them.  Since I've know them.  It's an entity that I'm worried, you dummy.  Uncut bombing chimp.  Oh, man.  This is really funny after all, man.  Did this air?  Yes.  I heard it in L.A.  I heard it in L.A.  Look at Anthony.  Did this actually air?  Frenchy called me all proud.  He's like, I sound great on the air.  You thought these were the outtakes or something? 
[00:51:30]  See, if you're a hardcore listener of the show and you hear this, there's some laughs in it.  Because you know Frenchy and how stupid this is and goofy and he's giving his schedule.  But to a new listener, and that's what you're trying to attract, this is just dog shit.  You wouldn't listen to this if it was Wolfgang Puck talking like this.  His schedule and cooking is like a world-renowned chef.  This is Frenchy talking about his schedule and what time he gets up.  Let me tell you how I sharpened my knives. 
[00:52:00]  I'm well-rested from my vacation.  This stuff ain't going to happen anymore.  I guarantee it.  Opie, what about the rest of the interview?  I think they want.  They're not strapped to regulations anymore, which is a great thing.  Describe Opie and Anthony in French to all the XM Nation.  Oh, my God.  Now he's going to do it in French.  A bad interview in another language.  Strap in, kids.  What's next?  Could you just think of things about ONA?  You have 30 seconds to now sell Opie and Anthony to all members of the XM Nation that have 
[00:52:30]  never heard them, but do it in English.  All right, guys.  So you have to get it because it's the greatest show there is on the market.  You've got to get it.  It's great.  You could listen to this thing.  It's unbelievable.  You will piss your pants out.  Even if I will piss your pants out.  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus Christ. 
[00:53:00]  It's a little long, but that could be a message board name.  Piss your pants out.  Piss your pants out.  Oh, my God.  Is that just atrocious?  Wait, there's a little more.  Oh, stupid foreigner can listen to it and like it and laugh its ass out.  Well, I don't know.  What a nervous.  Really thought this was going to be your segue back out of the show, didn't you, stupid?  This is the only air time he's had in four months.  If a foreigner can listen and laugh its ass out, you're calling yourself, it puts the 
[00:53:30]  lotion in the basket.  It laughs its ass out.  What you need.  Just listen to it.  You'll like it.  Frenchie is part of the ONA virus.  Merci beaucoup.  Bonsoir.  Merci beaucoup à vous.  Et à la prochaine.  I hope that last thing was, you stink.  Paul on Long Island.  What's up, Paul?  Played a Bob Kelly one.  That one's great, because that guy is the funniest fuck around. 
[00:54:00]  Bob Kelly?  Bob Kelly?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was fantastic.  All right.  Bob-a-booie.  I didn't hear that one.  Did he just give us a Bob-a-booie?  Did he?  Bob-a-booie to you, too, sir.  Wow.  In a time warp.  1987.  Yeah, he really got us.  Yelled another show reference.  Oh, wow.  You want to hear the Bob Kelly?  Yeah, why not?  Send this.  Maybe we could end this on an up note.  We'll try.  All right.  Well, here's an interview with Bob Kelly. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, by the way, I am...  The Bruce Kelly.  The Kelly's getting together.  B. Kelly.  Hi, Bob Kelly.  He's one of the O.P. and Anthony virus freaks, and they're coming to get him right now.  What's happening, man?  How do you...  Oh, God.  What's happening, man?  What's happening, man?  Oh, God.  Why would you laugh at that, Bob?  Brodery thing.  You fucking nervous idiot.  Is that really a big laugh-getter for you? 
[00:55:00]  They're coming to take me away.  Ooh, aha.  Yeah, you're right, man.  He's trying to sound all relaxed, and then they...  What's happening?  Bill ONA now on XM, and totally uncensored, totally free.  You're a stand-up comedian.  How does that let you loose here on ONA?  It's fantastic.  I'm so glad they're free.  Now, I just want to know, do I get my two bucks back for the last eight months?  But, yeah, it's fantastic.  It should be free.  More people get to listen to these two gentlemen, Opie and Anthony.  Get more fans, and then they can take over the world. 
[00:55:30]  I think that's their plan.  And be number one in the universe.  Why do you like being a part of the ONA show?  Because they have, uh...  They're the best fans in the world.  They have the best fans.  No, I'm just kidding.  They don't.  Their fans are evil, atrocious creeps, but that's why I love them.  ONA, because they're the best.  They're the best.  You get to say what you want.  They're the funniest thing on the radio.  The absolute truth.  You get to say what you want about, uh...  Fucking a sink.  Where else could I tell people that I fucked a sink when I was in Juvie Hall?  Which show will I be able to tell that on?  The Today Show?  Oh, no.  The FC... 
[00:56:00]  This is what I don't...  This is why...  The Today Show?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  They're calling, too.  The fact that Bob would just say something...  I mentioned an internet radio show at that point, not the Today Show.  Where else can I mention this on Iota?  If Bob would say something and then just repeat it?  Yeah.  It's the best show on the radio.  Dude, on the radio, this is the best show.  Best show.  On the radio.  Oh, what a ninny.  The sink.  That was in Juvie Hall.  What show will I be able to tell that on?  The Today Show?  No.  The FCC and censorship on the radio. 
[00:56:30]  I think that satellite radio is the new cable, you know, like cable television, man.  You finally get to hear what people really think.  And creeps like me get to get on the radio, finally.  There are many terrestrial radio shows I've done that had to talk about how my mother used  to hit me as a kid.  I actually told one time, I told this story when I was in Juvie, how I used to fuck a sink.  I get a lot of emails now about people, and they got it all wrong.  They think I actually fucked the whole sink, or actually fucked the drain of the sink, 
[00:57:00]  which is physically impossible.  I actually just lied on top of the sink, put my hand on the edge of the sink.  You lied on top of it?  Did you groan, man?  What a cluster F.  Oh, my God.  I think that the next time Bob's in the studio, before he's introduced, this interview should  be played.  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah, someone remember that.  Now I sound like I'm underwater again.  Really?  Really?  How'd that happen?  I don't know. 
[00:57:30]  Two seconds.  Do you hear it?  No.  I hear it coming through.  No.  It's not about you.  No, but I can hear it.  No, it's not really happening.  Stop.  I lubricated, and then I pushed my mule inside of my hand.  And the sink, all it was, was leverage.  It was just leverage.  It was a place that I could put my hand where it would be sturdy enough.  I could just pump it.  Me pumping the hand instead of the hand pumping me.  So it's actually like you're having sex.  They're in fucking the sink.  So please do it right.  I don't want people getting hurt trying to fuck the drain of a sink. 
[00:58:00]  30 seconds.  Tell me about Opie and Anthony.  Uh-oh.  These two guys are actually breaking ground, making new radio, making history.  Along with Jim Norton, they're actually saying how they feel about things instead of saying  what other people think they should say about stuff.  They're truth tellers.  They're prophets.  They're actually close to Jesus Christ of modern day age.  They give men what they want.  Boobs on the highway every Wednesday.  God bless them.  God bless Opie and Anthony.  Bob Scott, you're great. 
[00:58:30]  Bob Scott, you motherfucker.  It's Bob Kelly.  I'd stab you right in the neck with my fucking pencil right now.  Bob Scott.  You stink.  I wouldn't mind that if he didn't say, with my fucking pencil right now.  Yeah, yeah.  Kind of tripped up on that a little bit.  Can I introduce Vern Presley, are you stupid?  And who carries around a pencil with them?  Exactly.  I would sharpen it in my manual sharpener and then stab him in the neck with it.  I'll stab at you with my quill. 
[00:59:00]  All right.  Well, there you have it.  That one was really a good idea by the listeners.  What a mess.  Who is he?  Dennis Hopper in Apocalypse?  What is this?  Is this the Today Show?  Oh, no, wrong.  They're the absolute truth, man.  What are they going to say?  Opie and Anthony were wise men?  All right.  Well, we're going to take our first break.  Translation.  Somebody please like me.  Oh, that's funny.  The instant feedback is great on this segment. 
[00:59:30]  I think it's funny that someone made an Apocalypse Now comparison.  Bob has a body like Walter E. Kurtz.  Stupid bald head.  He should have a fly land in his mouth for the DVD version.  All right.  Damn.  Are we going to, um, what?  Take a break?  Or were you itching?  I was itching.  Oh, okay.  I got time to run to the bathroom and peroxide myself. 
[01:00:00]  I thought you were going to do it in here.  I thought you were going to do it in here so we could watch.  Can we have a, uh...  Get a garbage can.  Get a garbage can like a man.  Be a man.  Be a garbage pal.  Be a man.  You want to do it before or after break?  We could tease this.  Right now.  We could tease it.  Now, Anthony, there's no teasing.  We could just tease this.  There's no teasing with pain.  So people won't be turning the dial to Ethel or Squiz or Lucy or...  Oh, there he goes.  Hank's Place.  Fine-tuning if you're high. 
[01:00:30]  That's right.  Just pretend there's hand in the back of the head.  That tasted lovely.  Oh, I'm foaming.  Oh, my God.  That's annoying.  Wow.  Mad dog.  Mad dog.  Mad dog.  Ah! 
[01:01:00]  You know what we really need now?  Oh, my God.  It won't stop.  I told you.  What would be really funny right now is the change sound effect and then just peroxide.  Ha-ha.  Opiate, Anthony.  Peroxide.  Well, I hear he rinsed his mouth out with peroxide.  But that Opie.  That's one.  That was one.  Good.  That printed perfect.  All right.  Well, we're going to break as Anthony's mouth continues to foam.  That might prove that it's an infection, though. 
[01:01:30]  That stuff stinks.  The foaming is when it hits some kind of infection, right?  No.  It's when it hits anything.  When peroxide hits anything.  Yeah.  It's going to hit a sterile floor in an operating room and foam.  All right.  Well, we're going to do a little something something and continue.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus.  Let's say hi to Dragon Wagon.  Yeah, guys.  You...  Totally.  What?  What?  You broke up over there, sir? 
[01:02:00]  We can't hear you.  You totally offended me today.  We totally...  You're talking...  I'm an over-the-road truck driver, and this dude of these things and stuff, you're all  talking about is ridiculous.  What are you talking about?  The what thing, sir?  Did you take in any histamine before you call next time, clogged-nosed idiot?  It...  You guys are disgusting.  I mean, you know, I turned it on.  I'm calling XM and complaining about this channel.  That's all of this to it.  Really?  Yeah.  What don't you like about the channel? 
[01:02:30]  Well, you guys are hacks.  You wouldn't be Howard Stern.  I mean, you know, it's...  It's...  It's immoral, what you're talking about.  You know what you should do, sir?  Before you...  Right after you call XM, you should drink a fifth of old granddad and then drunk drive  into a schoolyard.  No one cares about you or if you're offended.  Block the channel, stupid.  It's an XL channel.  You can block it.  That's why XM has that.  You need to F you.  That's what you need to do.  Okay?  I'm hanging up. 
[01:03:00]  Hey, good.  Hang up.  Cancel XM and drop dead.  Let's not go that far.  All right.  Don't cancel...  Don't cancel XM.  Go to listen to XM Kids or something.  Yeah, go...  Yeah, exactly.  Maybe that's the wrong thing to say in front of Eric Logan.  And this guy, now he's listening to himself.  He'll be listening.  Listen, I'll go with the Sirius Radio.  Good.  Go to Sirius Radio.  There's a fucking dog for the thing.  They stink.  You're going to have to drive a truck to have Sirius.  Throw it in the back of the truck, you fucking hick.  Die.  Why don't you fucking blow your nose before you call a national radio show, you crank-doing 
[01:03:30]  jerk-off?  Now he's listening to himself.  Of course he is.  He'll be listening.  Of course he will.  He'll be listening.  And he doesn't even have the balls to say, fuck you.  We're uncensored, pal.  You can say, fuck you.  I don't believe in that.  You don't believe in that?  You're a liar and you're a failure.  No, I'm not a failure.  Yes, you are. 
[01:04:00]  I'm an over-the-road truck driver.  Why don't you have your fucking sinuses fixed?  I'm an over-the-road truck driver.  Yeah, all truck drivers are over-the-road, stupid.  They don't go through lawns and pools.  You redundant shithead.  I didn't hear you, sir.  I'm doing drugs and surviving an incest experience.  Break-up, break-up for the Dragon Wagon. 
[01:04:30]  Is that his name, Dragon Wagon?  Dragon Wagon, you got to, you know.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sorry.  It sounded like you had more brains on the radio.  We've got a long way to do it.  It ain't short time to get there.  Hold on, sir.  Wait, is your name really, dude, is your name really Dragon Wagon? 
[01:05:00]  You're a grown man with a name that rhymes.  Hey, slow down with the weird grown-up names.  Yeah, that's a challenging name.  At least it doesn't rhyme.  It's not Mopey Opie.  It's Mopey Opie.  Slim Jim.  And whatever the fuck rhymes with Anthony.  I can't think of anything.  Shmanthony.  If you don't understand, I'm out of here busting my ass for you people to be doing your dumb radio.  What are you, how are you busting your ass for us, stupid?  You're busting your ass to put food on your fat wife's table. 
[01:05:30]  We have nothing to do with it.  No, you're the type that voted for George Bush, aren't you?  You're the type that...  No, sir, I don't vote.  I talk a lot of shit, and then I sit home on election day.  That's the beauty of me.  But you're the reason the fuel prices are so hot in this country driving...  I'm the reason you motherfucker, you drive a truck!  I have a shatter and I cruise prostitutes in Manhattan!  Your food has to get there!  You have fucking 80 gallons of fuel in your vehicle!  I go a month on a gallon of gas! 
[01:06:00]  43rd Street to 15th Street, circled for four hours, back home!  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony, XM202.  And we're back. 
[01:06:30]  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  I'm being informed there's a dentist upstairs.  There's a dentist upstairs?  I should go up there and have him shoot me up.  Why not?  Or just put that stuff on that...  Is the dentist a fan of the show?  Welcome to my nightmare I had every day, Jimmy.  Maybe they just traded my crappy headphone equipment with yours.  Oh, what, your headphones are still... 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  They're fine-tuning, man.  I know.  The phones work great.  Where I sit, everything sounds good.  Anthony, you sound good finally, right?  Yeah, I sound good.  You're too busy worrying about your toothache.  They said I was a little low in the mix going out.  Yeah, I noticed that.  But it's because of the tooth hurting.  Oh, good.  I'm not talking as loud as I usually do.  All right.  Usually I'm a blabbering...  Is there a dentist upstairs?  That's what I hear.  From who?  These guys.  So send someone upstairs to see if they could do something.  Or just get that stuff that you rub on it. 
[01:07:30]  It would be cool to do this on the air.  Just go upstairs with a cell phone.  He said he's got an appointment at one, but he's got to do a show, and it's really hurting.  Oh, that would be cool.  Yeah, we'll just do the show from the dentist's office.  Norton was losing his mind during the commercial break about the Outerville horror that they remade.  They just remade the movie, and it got zero stars in all the New York papers.  It's getting just panned really bad.  I didn't see it, but why would you remake a film that is...  Why do you remake a movie that's 25 years old? 
[01:08:00]  It's just...  It's enough with the fucking remakes, you uncreative Hollywood asshole.  Come up with something.  Well, the original was with James Brolin, right?  Yeah.  And Margot Kidder, I think.  Oh, it was Margot Kidder.  Right?  See that?  Yep.  And it was...  The original was a low-budget film.  Doesn't hold up well, either.  Low-budget film that all of a sudden people just decided to go see like crazy, and it ended  up making like $80 million, which is a lot of money considering it came out in 1979, especially.  And I'm usually with you with these remakes, but that seemed like a no-brainer. 
[01:08:30]  You know, you update the movie with all the special effects and everything they could do nowadays.  It could have been a really, really cool flick.  It got zero stars?  Zero stars.  Why?  What are they saying is wrong with it?  I don't know.  How do you screw that up?  We can go through the paper and see what they're saying.  I just think interest in it.  It's like...  Because back then it was like an interesting concept, but now who gives a shit?  Yeah.  It's kind of been debunked.  Everybody has said, nah, it's a bunch of crap.  The Lutzes have kind of come out and admitted that they...  From what I heard, it's just crap.  Yeah, people back then used to get really fixated by things like that and really, you know, 
[01:09:00]  jump on it.  But, yeah, they remade it.  I mean, you know what it is?  They're pulling out all these old horror movies because it's huge now.  Things like The Ring and The Grudge and things like that, they add in those type of effects.  That weird fast motion thing.  Yeah, yeah.  The little kid in the shadows kind of moving fast and stuff.  All that, they add into this movie.  They're just...  You're going to see a lot of these things popping up.  Remakes of these old horror movies with the updated...  Growing up on Long Island, though, taking that ride to the Amityville Horror House. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, you had a few.  Of course.  Late at night.  Oh, man.  The house is just flat out creepy.  Yeah.  On the street.  Because of the image it had.  Yeah, because of the history and all.  Sure.  Anyway...  Is it still there or did they...  Yeah, someone bought it and then, I don't know, they remodeled the whole damn thing so  it doesn't look like it used to.  Oh, they took that front face...  Yeah.  Yeah, where it looked like two big eyes and stuff.  Now that's like one picture window or something.  I don't know.  It's been a few years since I've been in that area. 
[01:10:00]  But, yeah.  Look at the big headline, Dollsville.  Oh, it's great.  Amityville Horror, Dollsville, and Zero Stars, Haunted House remake should be condemned.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Should be condemned.  Hold on, hold on.  Sal from Philly wants to get really sarcastic here.  Sal!  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, um, I just heard on the commercial you guys are coming to Bill's Bar in Boston. 
[01:10:30]  Can't wait.  They're not replaying that, are they?  I heard one yesterday for Boston.  All right.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  Hey, Norton.  Yeah.  I can't hear you, sir, because I don't have my headphones on.  All right.  Yeah, Norton's out of the picture for a little bit here.  Might have tried to get you, though.  It wouldn't have mattered.  Sounded like one of those setups.  So, anyway, they're showing some of the actors from the movie in actual scenes.  Yeah.  In the review.  And then they have a little bubble with captions. 
[01:11:00]  A little comic strip caption bubble.  And I guess this guy's supposed to be the good-looking guy in the movie.  In his bubble, it says, I'm not even good-looking enough to save this movie.  And then they have, like, the couple clutching at each other because they're all scared in a bathroom.  Sure.  And the guy says, I'll never work again.  And the female actress there says, hold me.  I mean, this movie's so bad they knew it when they were making it.  I'll never work again?  Well, it's, what's his name?  What the hell is his name?  He, he'll work again.  He's, he's done plenty of lousy movies. 
[01:11:30]  It's just annoying that the paper's trying to be funny and, like, cutting edge.  Yeah, yeah.  I want to review the guy's attempt at comedy because it stinks.  All right.  It ought to be condemned.  And then you got the actress, I guess she's leaning over the roof or something, trying to hold on to somebody.  Yeah.  They're falling or something, and she's in a panic.  And then the bubble caption that this guy came up with is, don't leave me in this movie alone.  Oh, but you're like Fiorello LaGuardia, reading the comic strip during the strike, the news strike. 
[01:12:00]  Getting on the radio and reading the comic strips to the New Yorkers.  Oh, would people laugh at the funnies back then, these idiots?  He goes, and then in panel two, there's a man smoking a lucky, and another colored gentleman is, well, it's back in the old age.  Having his lucky put out with a fire hose.  And then there's, like, a child actor, actor, you know, little girl here.  Yeah.  Looking out one of the scary windows, and her caption says, I see bad actors and a bad script. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, see a play on Sixth Sense.  That's Lou.  I don't know how hard it is to say Sixth Sense when your tooth is pounding.  It's hard to say when your mouth feels good.  Trust me, I know.  Thank you, sir.  Lou Luminick.  Lou, Lou Luminick.  Lou, Lou, Lou Luminick.  He's the movie reviewer.  He is?  He stinks.  He gave it zero stars, and his comedy stinks as well.  The only thing sadder than watching MGM pass into history, it was just subsumed into Sony, 
[01:13:00]  is watching the once-mighty studio's last major release, a truly pitiful remake of the Amityville horror.  Even by the low standards of contemporary horror movies, this remake of the old American International Pictures' biggest hit  is shoddily made, boring, and most shockingly, without a single decent scare.  Shoddily made.  Shoddingly.  Really no scares in it?  Shoddily, right.  Shoddily.  I've seen some bad reviews for horror movies, but they're scary as hell.  Yeah.  You know, like the storyline sucks, and people go, oh, this is an awful movie. 
[01:13:30]  But you're just going there to kind of be scared.  To be scared.  Yeah, but this one doesn't even have scary moments?  No.  Well.  No.  I shan't be seeing that one until I'm in a hotel room and there's nothing else to watch.  He's back!  Yeah, I'm back, but I'm back not to argue with you, Hacks.  Oh.  We both got rid of the egg film.  We currently are getting serious.  Yeah.  I'll tell you what, you two are the biggest joke, and she is right now writing a letter 
[01:14:00]  to egg film.  Who is?  My wife.  Really?  Yeah.  The one that wears the pants in the family?  Do you realize that your letter will not be read by anyone at XM?  Well, I don't know why.  Do you realize that we had the head of programming in here when you called yesterday, Dragon Wagon,  and the guy, Eric Logan, thought it was one of the funniest things we've done since  coming to XM Satellite Radio.  Why are you trying to threaten us?  We don't give a fuck about you and your letter.  Yeah, why don't you tell your fat wife to get on her knees and service you, and maybe  you wouldn't be such an uptight asshole. 
[01:14:30]  Listen to me.  For one minute, without you, I have to use four-letter expletives, all right?  Four-letter expletives?  How about this?  Heck, is that a four-letter expletive?  Sounds like somebody defecated in your mouth.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.  How about this?  Your wife's a cunt.  Yeah.  What do you think of them apples, stupid?  Wow.  If you're going to play, then let's play, fat boy.  That's what you married.  Will you honestly admit that...  And why are you so obsessed with us that you're calling every day?  Yeah, why? 
[01:15:00]  I know why, because you're enjoying the attention, right?  XM is going down.  They lost NASCAR.  It's going to Sirius Radio.  I found out.  Have you seen the deals XM has made in the last couple weeks alone, you stupid fuck?  NASCAR Radio.  Big XM.  Oh, it really is.  I'd love to hear that.  Yeah, well...  The point is, y'all are a bunch of hacks.  We went to church last night.  We prayed for you all.  Did you really?  Did you say hello to the priest who was busy molesting a child in the back room?  Did you mention that? 
[01:15:30]  Well, I got news for you.  My pastor does not molest children.  Well, then he's a stupid ass, because they're all right there.  How could he turn them down?  Your pastor's a fruit.  Your pastor doesn't have the balls to go out and take what's his.  You befuddled me.  All you can do is downgrade and degrade people.  Downgrade and degrade people?  Stop trying to sound like you're a black radio station promo, you jerk-off.  Downgrade and degrade.  That's what you're doing.  You're trying to downgrade me, because without me being out here on the road, it is true. 
[01:16:00]  No, it's Mr. Important again.  Sir, I can honestly tell you, I hope that you are killed drunk driving.  See?  You know, I can blow my air horn just like you could blow off at the mouth.  Dragon wagon.  Oh, that was a good one.  You should blow your air horn.  That's exactly what you should do, sir.  As you're barreling into a group of children with alcohol on your breath.  I don't drink.  I don't smoke.  And you don't fuck a woman who's under 400 pounds.  That's your problem.  That's your problem, man.  You have no vices. 
[01:16:30]  And you go home to a fat pig in a dress who browbeat you.  No.  You don't want to go to church, stupid.  You want a truck.  You're going to tell me you never picked up one of those lot lizards, one of those dumb  whores in a truck stop?  You never tried to get blown in a truck stop?  No, because I'm not going to have something that I can't force off with four ox bleeds.  What is worse, sir?  Is there an R in that?  It's going to worse.  You're probably walking around with AIDS yourself there.  I mean, you're...  Sir, if I am walking around with AIDS, it's just my secret.  I'm still not going to wear condoms. 
[01:17:00]  Don't try to discourage me.  You know.  Hold on.  Slider wants in.  Slider?  Yeah, Slider.  This is Slider.  Hey, Wagoneer, why don't you turn back Sesame Street, watch that, get off my radio program.  You're interrupting my entertainment for the morning.  I am trying to uphold a moral authority here.  You know, there's...  Do that on Sesame Street.  Take that from somewhere else.  There are too many people like you in this world that are just floods, that are just slabs. 
[01:17:30]  You and the people...  He didn't cancel.  Nope.  No.  He's still listening.  Hey, Dragonwagon, why didn't you cancel?  Why did you just cancel like you said you were going to?  Do you want to hear my serious radio listen?  Did you hear that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's serious, baby.  Uh-oh.  So then stop thinking about it.  Why would you call the Opie and Anthony show if you're listening to Sirius?  Yeah.  Yeah, because I wanted to get through to you all without that other idiot there. 
[01:18:00]  I'm already here, sir.  I'm here every day.  You dummy.  You fucking dummy.  You think I was a stopping yesterday?  Take your Sirius and cram it up your wife's fat ass.  Pound it up there with a mallet, you uneducated zilch.  And stop being so obsessed with us.  If you don't like us, then you know what?  Then stop listening, because I guarantee you still have XM in your rig.  And maybe, you know, if enough people stop listening to us, then we'll just go away. 
[01:18:30]  And then you'll be a happy camper.  So what are you saying, sir, that you got...  Now, how do you have Sirius in your truck if you got so offended at Opie and Anthony yesterday?  So you called, canceled, got your Sirius unit, and had it all installed by yesterday morning?  Is that what you're saying?  You fucking liar.  This day afternoon, I went home...  You're a liar.  And I went to H.H. Craig, and I bought a Sirius radio.  You are a liar.  How?  It's all portable.  It just plugs into the...  A Sirius unit is not portable, sir. 
[01:19:00]  They're fucking 80 pounds.  Dragon wagon, just go away.  Is that really your handle, good buddy?  Dragon wagon?  Yeah, it is dragon wagon.  You are a faggot.  Do you know that?  You should have your mouth wrapped around one end of a hole in a buddy booth.  You are just jealous that I have a job like I do that I...  You know how many truckers are laughing right now over your handle?  You fucking faggot.  It rhymes.  Who the hell calls themselves Dragon Wagon? 
[01:19:30]  Ugh.  I know I have a stupid name, but I got it when I was 12.  I had no choice in the matter.  Yeah, do you and your wife call each other by handles?  You're Dragon Wagon and she's bunt cunt?  Why don't you drop dead, stupid?  But the point of the matter is there, you know, you need to be fired just like you were before.  I don't know what you was fired for, but I'm sure it was for affinity.  They weren't fired, stupid.  They had...  Here's what happened.  They had sent two people to have anal sex in a Catholic church.  Now, I'm sure that goes on in your church as well. 
[01:20:00]  And, you know, the church handles these things so well as they prove with cardinal law during the fucking, you know, giving one of the masses for the Pope's funeral.  You know, you're sad.  You're sad.  No, I'm not.  I'm very happy and I make a lot of money.  And I get blown all the time by strange chicks.  I'm actually very happy, sir.  Do you realize without the trucking industry that your ass wouldn't have that radio show?  And you're the trucking industry?  Yes, sir.  You're just one douchebag.  You're just one trucker, you ass.  You're a cog.  You know how many truckers listen to this program?  I would imagine not too many because I was just standing in the channels and I came up on that. 
[01:20:30]  And I started listening to it.  Then I got violently ill from you.  You know, you guys are just the type of people that are what's wrong with this world.  Hey, Dragon Wagon, what does your wife look like?  My wife is 5'2", red hair, great breasts, beautiful legs.  You know, she works out at the YMCA every day with me.  She works out at the Young Man's... 
[01:21:00]  You really are.  You are as fucking white trash.  What was your wedding song, a Foxworthy bit?  You make me nauseous.  She works out at the YMCA.  Oh, you really are shit.  You're a lucky man.  Yeah, you're right.  I am kind of jealous of your life.  I actually am.  You want to know about what he's talking about?  The C of love there, right?  Of course the C of love.  C stands for cunt, and that's what you married.  Oh.  Dragon Wagon, just go away.  We don't need you.  No, keep calling.  I love this guy. 
[01:21:30]  Dude, keep calling the radio show.  Keep yourself involved.  Keep looking for your little bit of fame.  Just be honest about what you're doing.  That's what makes me so fucking sick with you.  Never appear for me again after today, because I have no more use to waste my cell minutes on your ass.  Sir, your voice, we heard you, and your voice meant nothing.  We heard what you had to say.  We don't care if you went and bought Sirius.  I'm not going to say the other company, S-I-R-I-U-S.  You want to go out and buy it?  Go fucking buy it.  And Eric Logan doesn't care. 
[01:22:00]  He was here.  He thought it was hilarious.  We're not going anywhere.  And this proves, actually, that we're doing our jobs quite nicely.  We want people to hate us like you, sir.  Don't you get it?  You're the only...  Because that means there's a bunch of people that are going to latch on to this program.  You're the type of people...  You're the type of people.  No.  Da-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  That's it.  Da-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  You can keep trying.  That's so mature.  You can keep trying, but you're not going to break us. 
[01:22:30]  Do you understand you're not going to break us?  Ever.  Ever?  What did y'all do while y'all were on hiatus or fired or whatever?  He knows a lot about us.  Well, I'll tell you what I did.  I went to towns like yours and got blown by women married to guys like you who weren't  home, taking care of business.  And after the gig, I would take them out into the parking lot, and they would lean over,  and these little church wives would...  And I would send them back home, and they'd kiss dummies like you on the mouth when they  got home.  Well, I'm home every day. 
[01:23:00]  I work for an excellent company.  I don't care who you work for.  Who do you work for?  It don't matter who I work for.  Why?  You know who we work for.  Why are you hiding?  Why won't you admit it?  Jack, you know what I did?  I just counted my millions over and over and over again.  I'm like, wow, what does a million dollars look like in all pennies?  Oh, this is very interesting.  Art worth.  Is that the best you have?  You're never going to break us.  Do you understand that?  No.  You see, you think it's your head up for hands because you're the big, rich guy.  Exactly. 
[01:23:30]  No.  No, actually, no.  No, not really.  I was poor just about my entire life.  What comes around goes around, and, you know.  I'll tell you why, why, why.  That was a.  Sorry, you really, you say some poignant things.  What goes around comes around.  Finish with that thought.  That's a really interesting way to look at the world.  Yeah, it's a stupid way to look at the world because if you, if.  You know how many people enjoy this show?  That means we're doing a lot of good.  Can't be stupid.  So, so you're stupid, what goes around comes around crap doesn't work here. 
[01:24:00]  Comes around, goes around.  Oh, dude.  How many Nazis lived a ripe old age in Brazil living it up?  There can't be.  They didn't get their comeuppance.  What comes around doesn't go around sometimes.  There's at least one or two in Queens still living.  There's some real.  Playing golf every day.  Shuffleboard.  And there's some really good people that are dead.  Exactly.  Died early.  Exactly.  So shut up.  Your logic stinks.  You're not ready to make me cuss, okay?  Why don't you just shut up?  Yeah.  I'm starting to think this guy enjoys the show.  He's a phony.  He's a phony.  He's a phony. 
[01:24:30]  And he's, it's his time in the sun.  And it's, yeah, his time to shine.  And it'll be like, okay, you guys rule.  Dude, you're a fake.  You actually are a fan of the show.  No, I'm not.  Yes, you are.  No, I listen to Rush Limbaugh, okay?  That's who I'm a fan of is Rush Limbaugh.  Really?  Don't listen to Rush Limbaugh.  Another fat guy just telling you what opinions to have, huh?  Oh, he ain't telling me, but I will say the rosary for you all the night.  Yeah, you do that.  I will say the rosary while I'm standing there on the treadmill tonight.  You'd say rosaries on a treadmill? 
[01:25:00]  You're a real servant of God, sir.  Why don't you stick the rosaries up your wife's fat ass?  Why don't you tie them around your ball bag like a cock ring and finally give your wife  what she needs, stupid?  I'm sending you a half-hard rod.  I'm just tired from driving all day, baby.  Let's pray.  Go use those as anal beads somewhere.  I'm tired.  I'm not tired of driving.  I enjoy my job.  Unlike some people.  Your life stinks, sir, and you know it.  You hate your wife.  You want to choke her.  You're sick of looking at her.  You don't get along.  You probably have kids you don't like. 
[01:25:30]  Stop trying to convince us that you like your life.  Your life stinks.  It's the Russian football program.  Talent on loan from God.  What, Dragon Wagon?  You're on the air.  What a douchebag.  Bye, Dragon Wagon.  He's a phony.  Good.  Yeah, he's a phony.  All right. 
[01:26:00]  D.D.  Wow.  There she is.  I heard see you next Tuesday word.  You guys said cunt.  Oh, wow.  So you just said it, too.  I know.  I haven't heard that word in a long time.  No?  Just a word.  It doesn't mean anything.  I know.  They're all just words.  Good word.  Yeah, but it's just like, wow, that's on the radio.  Cool.  It's just a silly word.  Yeah.  Just a little silly word.  So what's up, D.D.?  I am busy doing traffic.  I have Chicago Mini and I have Dallas.  D.D.'s doing Dallas today.  Cool.  Yeah.  How's the traffic in Dallas, D.D.? 
[01:26:30]  It's yellow right now.  It's yellow?  What the hell does that mean?  It means it's like mediocre.  Like green means smooth sailing.  Yellow is, you know, it's getting heavy.  And then red is you're fucked.  Well, we want to talk to you a little bit.  When do you have to go back to traffic?  A few minutes.  A few minutes?  We want you to do the news today.  I can give you the shorthand version.  Uh, you want the shorthand version of the news, Ant?  A little bit.  Before D.D. has to leave?  Why not?  All right, D.D.  Okay, Nationals won their home opener. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Baseball's back in D.C.  Yes, it is.  In Boston.  Hey, we noticed that President Bush could throw a good pitch there.  Yeah, he threw out the first pitch.  Threw out the first pitch and did fine for the Nationals, and he didn't look all stupid.  Right.  Got it right over the plate.  There you go.  Yeah.  And in Boston, Yankees-Red Sox, Sheffield eighth inning fight last night.  Those animals in Boston.  Yeah.  Those animals.  I saw the video.  Yeah, so did I.  And you know what?  The guy was just swiping for the ball. 
[01:27:30]  He was.  I swear to God, the guy was just swiping for the ball.  Ball's in play.  Leave it alone.  Get out of the player's way.  It happens at every ballpark.  When the ball goes down the line like that, people are reaching over, trying to grab for  the ball.  Well, this guy goes for a scoop, and then Sheffield claims that the guy punched him.  Just another.  Maybe the hand hit Sheffield, but the guy wasn't trying to hit Sheffield.  It was an unfortunate incident, and then Sheffield turns around and tries to punch the guy in  the face.  Good for Sheffield.  No, not good for Sheffield.  Good for Sheffield. 
[01:28:00]  It was an accident.  The guy was just scooping for the ball.  That is true.  Sheffield.  If they want the fans out of play, then they should raise up these walls on the side there.  That's all.  Well, of course these people are going to be reaching for the ball when it's going down  the line.  They want that souvenir.  If Sheffield wants to punch anyone, it should be R. Kelly for tagging his wife on video.  That's right.  It's so funny, because the New York papers, the Daily News, the headline is, Fan Socks  Sheffield. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  Because, of course, it's the New York angle.  Yep.  The fan did not...  I'm reading that, bro.  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.  Jimmy just took his headphones off and...  No, I'm reading that one, too.  This is the bit where I read the front pages of the newspapers.  Oh, my God.  The show's falling apart in front of my eyes.  Why don't you just grab a bagel, too, there, Jimmy?  What are you doing?  I'm just going to read the paper and tell us this thing.  I didn't realize you were doing that.  What happened?  I'm just...  I can't...  I'm not dealing with the headphones anymore.  But you have to.  We got D.D. on. 
[01:29:00]  This is a big feature on our show.  He's having a problem with the headphones.  Some people, you know.  Anyway, well, the Daily News says fans socked Sheffield.  But the Boston paper is saying, you know, Sheffield losing it.  Uh-huh.  Both have their different angles.  Yeah, of course.  As far as the incident goes.  Well, they're going to defend him.  And the New York Post here in New York socked.  Socked.  Boston bozo swat Sheffield.  Bozo.  But he didn't.  You know, from the video I saw, it looked like he took a swipe at him. 
[01:29:30]  It looks like maybe he was going for the ball when he saw Sheffield coming.  He took a little, you know, took a little jab at him.  He had his arm down and he was trying to scoop up the ball.  That's it.  That's it.  And now ESPN and all the sports channels and even the news channels are all making a huge deal out of this thing.  Of course they are.  A huge, huge deal.  Where is the clips of the coaches talking?  The legendary rivalry.  I understand that.  Which is the first one, Torrey or Francona?  All right, this is what Joe Torrey had to say about the incident, Anthony. 
[01:30:00]  These people shouldn't be allowed to walk the streets, much less come to a ball game.  And, you know, the sad part about it is a handful of people.  Yeah.  Joe Torrey is out of his mind.  Shouldn't be allowed to walk the streets.  They shouldn't be allowed to walk the streets, let alone go to a ball game?  The guy was just trying to scoop up a freaking baseball.  That's it.  Lock them up.  Torrey is losing his mind.  Scumbag.  Joe Torrey honestly thinks that fan purposely tried to punch Sheffield in the face, right?  He called it like he saw it. 
[01:30:30]  Were you there, Opie?  Huh?  Were you there?  I've seen the video a hundred times like everyone else this morning.  Were you there?  No.  Joe Torrey was there.  He had the worst angle in the whole ballpark.  He was there.  I would rather take the word of somebody that was there.  They shouldn't walk the streets.  I agree.  Did you see the video?  Did you see some of the people that came to our gig?  Should they be walking the streets?  I say no.  I say Joe Torrey is completely correct.  Blown out of proportion.  Now we got what Francona said, the Red Sox manager there. 
[01:31:00]  Right.  All right.  He got two great teams and two great baseball cities and a lot of emotion.  I'm not sorry to see them leave town.  I'm not sorry to see them leave town.  Wow.  Look at that.  And stay out.  Go fuck yourself.  I'm with the Sox on this one.  I gotta tell you.  Stop it.  Of course you are.  He's happy that they're leaving town because they're, you know, prima donnas.  What?  Sheffield can't handle a fan, you know, trying to scoop up a baseball, so now turns around 
[01:31:30]  and tries to slug the guy?  He's happy they're out of there.  He doesn't need their crap.  Happy they're out of there?  I think there's a certain eight-year-old boy that isn't, and his family that isn't happy  to see the Yankees coming back to New York.  That's another stupid story.  Oh, what?  A-Rod the lifesaver?  A-Rod saving a little, he didn't, Massachusetts child?  Dude, I do that on a daily basis.  I'm not on the front page of a newspaper.  You're at a crosswalk.  You make a couple hundred thousand dollars less than he does.  You're at a crosswalk and you see a kid kind of like wandering, you know, forward a little 
[01:32:00]  bit, what do you do?  You put your arm up and go, whoa, hey, hey, slow down there, sonny.  This kid was in full-bore run.  No, he wasn't.  And there was a big truck coming.  No, he wasn't.  Is what I heard.  It's a Ritz-Carlton, and I know which one the Yankees stay at.  It's the one on Newbury Street, where the traffic is not much, and the traffic is really  slow.  There was a truck barreling down.  A-Rod quickly went into a phone booth, put a cape on, and there was a big A on his chest. 
[01:32:30]  And he scooped the child up.  These newspapers, they're just starved.  They really are.  They're starved for stories.  Why is that the front page of one of the New York papers, that A-Rod saved this kid's  life?  He didn't save the kid's life.  I read the story.  He should have pushed him.  The kid was a little excited and started walking towards the road.  He wasn't really even off the curb much.  Opie, what?  Were you there?  I read it.  You read it.  Were you there?  No, Anthony. 
[01:33:00]  Well, A-Rod was there.  He knows what happened.  The boy and his family were there.  You know, you're delusional when it comes to your Yankees.  The kid's a little Yankee fan, by the way.  You're delusional.  Yeah, he won't get his ass kicked at school.  Yeah, he's dead.  A-Rod's greatest catch.  Yankees star pulls eight-year-old boy from the path of moving truck on a busy Boston street.  First of all, it's not a busy Boston street like other busy streets.  It's a one-way.  There's so many foo-foo-type shops and things like that. 
[01:33:30]  People want to be seen in their stupid cars, so they take the right on Newbury, and they drive really slow.  It takes one vehicle.  This isn't a highway.  It takes one vehicle.  Boston.  For the first time in his Yankees career, Alex Rodriguez was cheered in Boston.  There you go.  But it had nothing to do with anything he did on the baseball field.  Rodriguez risked...  Read on.  Read on.  Read on and give the man the credit he deserves.  How much does A-Rod make a year? 
[01:34:00]  $25 million, I think.  $25 million a year.  You're trying to tell me this guy risked his life.  Is that what it says?  A $25 million a year contract, and he has a kid of his own to save some 8-year-old boy?  Are you insane?  That's the kind of guy that you find on a team like the Yankees.  Somebody needs to be...  Class, class, gentleman.  Somebody...  No!  Somebody needs to be checking into what's being written in these stupid newspapers.  They're just making crap up these days.  No. 
[01:34:30]  Any Yankee would have done this.  A-Rod risked his life Wednesday to save an 8-year-old boy from getting hit by a fast-moving truck on Newbury Street.  Mm-hmm.  The boy's father, Joe McCarthy...  ...said last night.  As fate would have it, the boy, Patrick, is a die-hard Yankees fan living in Red Sox Nation.  I can't express enough gratitude, Joe McCarthy said.  He saved my son's life.  Yes, he did.  A-Rod said he was about to enter a car when he noticed a truck heading in his direction and quickly decided to step back to protect himself. 
[01:35:00]  Then he turned around.  He saw young Patrick running into the street and directly toward the utility truck.  Yep.  No kid just runs in the street toward a truck.  Not this kid.  A-Rod saved him.  Maybe he was running toward A-Rod to get an autograph, and he was going to stop right at A-Rod.  Fucking idiots.  Because I've been on Newbury Street in front of the Ritz-Carlton, actually with Club Sertikani,  and all the you stupid Yankee fans, when they're playing in Boston, they all hang out outside. 
[01:35:30]  Right, Ben?  That is true.  Hang outside the Ritz-Carlton hoping to get a glimpse of their stars and possibly a photograph or an autograph.  Well, think of the thrill they must have felt watching A-Rod save this child's life, then.  These fucking reporters should be shot in the head for not reporting it the right way.  This is the right way.  It is very obvious what was going on here.  Yeah, A-Rod saved the child's life.  No, A-Rod was getting into a vehicle.  There happened to be a truck on Newbury.  Yes, okay? 
[01:36:00]  He sees a kid running.  The kid's not running right at the truck.  He's running toward A-Rod to get an autograph.  A-Rod was in a safe location.  He could have been with a kid.  He's going to run past A-Rod to run in front of a truck when he was there to see Yankee players?  Crossing the street?  I fucking hate the news.  I fucking hate the news.  Every day I watch the local news in New York and I just lose my mind.  Yeah, apparently so. 
[01:36:30]  We can hear it right now.  I lose my mind because they don't report accurately.  A-Rod said he was about to enter a car, so he was entering the car, okay?  All these Yankee fans are outside the hotel like they do, trying to get their autographs and pictures.  This kid is a die-hard Yankee fan.  He's got a Yankee hat on and a Yankee shirt.  So all of a sudden he sees A-Rod and goes, oh my God, that's A-Rod.  There's one of my heroes, and starts running toward the guy, and probably with other people.  All right, so he's getting into a car.  When he noticed a truck heading in his direction, he quickly decided to step back to protect himself. 
[01:37:00]  When he turned around, he saw young Patrick running into the street and directly toward the utility truck.  But A-Rod said he acted instinctively during the lunchtime incident, grabbing the boy and pulling him back with him.  See?  I was trying to get out of the way, and the kid was running the other way, Rodriguez said, before last night's game.  He was about to run into the street, and I kind of just put my arm around him.  We both almost got run over.  Holy shit.  This just did not happen. 
[01:37:30]  This just did not happen like this.  Super A-Rod.  A-Rod almost got ran over in Boston.  Saving a young Boston child.  I'd like to see one of those Red Sox save a little New York kid.  It was just unbelievable.  Truly a God moment, the father said.  A-Rod could have been seriously hurt, but that didn't stop him.  It was the best catch of his career.  Ah.  See?  And they even got a...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  This is so stupid. 
[01:38:00]  Do you understand the stupidity?  I know you're trying to mess with me, Anthony, but this is stupid.  Yeah.  No, there's not one of these guys out there that would actually risk their life.  I'd like to see Johnny Damon scoop up a little New York kid by the stadium.  He's too busy throwing water balloons out his window on the 34th floor of the Ritz.  Oh, is that what he was doing?  Yeah.  Well, there you go.  There's the difference.  You got the Yankees are saving lives, and the Red Sox are throwing water balloons out the window. 
[01:38:30]  There you go.  And pumpkins.  And pumpkins.  That makes perfect sense.  Where's the class team?  You don't deserve those rings, Ben.  Oh, come on.  You don't even deserve the rings.  Come on.  Yes, we do.  And football season's about to begin, and win that again.  You think A-Rod's World Series ring, like, glimmered in the sun as he put his arm around that child?  A-Rod, World Series ring?  What?  You saw the, uh...  A-Rod doesn't have a World Series ring.  Well, yeah, it really doesn't, Anthony.  Jesus Christ.  We didn't know you're players. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, my God.  Fuck.  I just assume everyone on the Yankees has one.  Oh, my God.  You fair weather fan.  Jesus.  Damn.  You know, you're right.  Isn't it about time to jump off that wagon?  Yeah.  It probably is.  You already started hitting the other day that you like the Mets.  Well, I do kind of like the Mets.  I like the Nationals.  I'm going to be a Nationals fan.  This is just stupid.  The saddest thing, it's on the front page of the paper.  That's what pisses me off.  Do you know what's going on in the world? 
[01:39:30]  And this is the front page.  There was a hotel fire in where Paris, 18 people actually died.  Died, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  We got that guy over in Iraq.  Of course, he was French.  He wasn't one of them.  The hostage guy that decided to go over there and sell bottled water or something.  Oh, that poor bastard.  And now he's a hostage begging for his life.  That's a little more important than this fake story that they came up with.  That could be the world's, like, the world's worst photo op these days. 
[01:40:00]  Like, it used to be your mug shot with some kind of allegations of child sex, perhaps.  But now the world's worst photo op is you between the masked guys with the machine guns  and one of those wacky Middle Eastern flags behind you.  That is the photo you never, ever, ever want your face to appear in.  And that guy is in there just going, like, oh, now it's me.  I'm the guy.  I can't believe I'm here now.  Awful.  It really is awful. 
[01:40:30]  I think that story's a little more important than this made-up crap.  Mm-hmm.  And then the father.  Her father said he was off to the side and didn't see the situation develop,  but heard the sound of a screeching truck oozed from the crowd, then shears.  When he looked up, he saw his son in Rodriguez's arms,  as well as a few stunned expressions from onlookers.  The kid was running into the street, and he was about to get run over by a car.  From his vantage point, he couldn't see the truck coming, A-Rod said. 
[01:41:00]  So there you have it.  Saving lives.  That is the big story today, according to the New York paper, Anthony.  Saving lives.  Anyway, DeeDee, what else do you have?  Well, Little Miss Brittany's having a baby.  Does anyone really care?  Well, I'm just letting you know some Hollywood gossip.  Yeah?  What do you think of Brittany having a baby there, DeeDee?  She beat me to it.  Oh.  Why, are you trying?  Well, not yet.  I don't have a significant other that I'm serious about, 
[01:41:30]  so no, I don't want to be one of those moms that end up with just a baby daddy and no husband.  Just go to Vegas.  Just go to Vegas.  Seems to be the way you pick husbands.  Yeah.  No, I'm going to remember my next wedding night.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a good idea.  Yeah, that's a good goal to have.  Rule of thumb.  Sure.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, I didn't have much time because I'm doing Dallas today.  Right, she's got the extra traffic.  I have extra city today.  DeeDee does Dallas.  DeeDee does Dallas. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  We get it, DeeDee.  There you go, all you Dallas people.  And anything else in the news today?  You know, gas prices still on the rise.  Michael Jackson's still fucked up.  You know, the same old shit.  Wow, that's how you report the news?  I like how she does the news.  I like that.  Today, yeah, because I'm telling you, it's a busy traffic day today.  It's Friday.  You don't get confused when you go back over to traffic and go, if you're driving in Dallas,  you're fucked today.  Am I the only one?  I can't do that on that channel, but I can do it on your channel.  All you Dallas people, it's yellow, so yeah, deal with it.  Am I the only one that thought that, at the least, when we went into Iraq, that we would 
[01:42:30]  have really cheap gas?  Yeah.  At the least.  Yeah, for all the people that say, oh, we're just there for the oil, man.  It's Bush's war of oil, man.  They secured the oil fields before they secured the museums, man.  Yeah, why are we paying more than we ever have, and barrels of oil are higher than they've  ever been?  Shut up, stupid.  Gas price is still cheaper than what they pay in Europe, by the way.  Thank you.  Yeah, they are.  Oh, I've been hearing that gag for years. 
[01:43:00]  Thank you.  No, it's still cheaper than, shut up.  Thank you.  Thank you.  That's true, because my sister lives in Germany, so.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And what's the latest on the Michael Jackson case?  Anything?  Um, you know, I haven't looked up, because I didn't have time.  He's, you know.  Well, there's a big story out of that.  The defense.  Yeah, it's also about the Elvis thing.  Like, I don't know if you guys saw that.  He has to, like, he has so much time to, what, sell the Elvis stuff or whatever, something  like that.  Well, it would be the Beatles stuff.  The Beatles, I mean.  There you go.  Elvis, Beatles, whatever.  This just amazes me that Michael Jackson owns the Beatles catalog. 
[01:43:30]  That's sad.  It's just, it's just amazing.  And, uh, and he's thinking of selling, he doesn't want to sell it off, but his handlers  are basically saying, you don't really have a choice in the matter.  Going broke.  Your bills are, uh, out of hand.  And I guess, uh, the Beatles catalog would go for a half a billion dollars.  Half a billion?  Half a billion dollars.  Wow.  And then, when it's all said and done, they would give him, uh, seven to eight million dollars  a year to live off.  Oh, yeah?  Which he's hinting would not be enough money. 
[01:44:00]  Not be enough.  He goes through all that.  Which is good.  He's got all his peeps.  He's got to run Neverland.  He's got to learn how to budget his money and sell Neverland.  He'll never close that.  No, he'll never sell or close that place down.  That's his, uh, his little retreat for touching kids.  Oh, that's just sick.  He'll never get rid of that place.  That's sick, but.  Well, the, uh, mother of the, um, the little boy was up on the stand, and now I guess the defense  gets to grill her, and she's not that credible of a witness.  So, uh, they're saying this could be the big break in the case where Michael Jackson actually, 
[01:44:30]  uh, the, the pendulum swings to the acquittal side with, uh, with this woman getting up  there.  Because apparently she's, you know, she's always been trying to finagle money out of  celebrities, and she's a liar.  She had some kind of welfare scam going, which she had to plead the fifth on.  Uh, so, I don't know.  This, I'm starting to think as the trial goes on.  I told you, dude.  That Michael's going to, going to walk on this one.  Of course he's going to walk on this one.  You know what it is?  At first, the prosecution makes it sound like, well, we got it. 
[01:45:00]  We got everything we need.  The evidence is overwhelming.  And then they parade some of these witnesses around, and they're just, they have no credibility  whatsoever.  And, uh, I guess the, the defense is doing a good job of, um, breaking down these people.  So, yeah, Michael could walk, and he'll touch more kids.  They just don't have the, they just don't have the atom bomb of evidence.  No, the guy's pretty good.  He's done this for years.  Look.  He knows how to touch kids.  I have no doubt in my mind that, uh, according to what I've read and seen on, well, here we 
[01:45:30]  go again on, on stupid TV, where they're so accurate that he's, you know, touched kids  and stuff.  I have no doubt in my mind.  But, with that said, they just don't have that one piece of evidence that could, uh,  you know, wrap this case up.  Right.  They just don't.  The little jizz-stained underoos.  Ew.  Nothing like that.  Oh.  That real big piece of evidence they need.  Yeah.  So, that's the latest on, uh, Michael Jackson, I guess.  Anything else?  Uh, no, my throat's gone.  Oh, my, I'm sorry. 
[01:46:00]  I have a sinus infection, and it's draining right now.  Ooh, hot.  Yeah.  Not really.  That's really sexy.  A draining sinus infection.  A draining sinus infection.  You like that?  Is that Norton?  Mm.  Norton gave up on the radio show.  He's in the corner reading the New York Times.  He is, by the way, fuming right now.  I can't even, I can't even convey how pissed off our little Jimmy Norton is right now.  He's not even, he has separated himself from everything on this planet right now.  He's just, uh, he's not even looking at us. 
[01:46:30]  No.  His head is hiding behind the New York Times.  He's dreaming of Atlantic City.  Aw.  The bagada this weekend.  The bagada, yeah.  I'll be down there, Jimmy.  I would love to go by.  I'll be supporting you tomorrow night, Jimmy.  I'm supposed to see the dentist upstairs, by the way.  What time?  At 9.15.  I go upstairs at 9.15, and I'm going to say, do something.  I see my dentist at 1, but I need something between now and then.  All right, but we have to, uh, we have to get this all on the radio.  Take the phone up with me or something. 
[01:47:00]  All right, take the phone up, and Eric will take the phone up.  Yeah.  All right, very good, because, uh...  Yeah, D.D., uh, Anthony is barely, uh, here today.  He has a really bad toothache.  Oh.  Oh.  So, Anthony, out of commission, more or less.  Yeah.  Probably a cavity.  Still does great radio, even under these circumstances.  Thank you, L.P.  Didn't even sleep last night.  No.  And, uh, Norton has given up on the show, so...  You poor thing.  You're there all alone.  I wish I was there to help you.  Someone get me a stack of records.  I'll go old school.  Norton's had some equipment problems and just steps away from the situation. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  You'd be great in a pinch.  Like, did you see Norton in Apollo 13?  Yeah, no shit.  Houston, we have a problem.  Yeah, the ship doesn't work.  The other guys are trying to fix it, and Jimmy's just sitting back reading some manuals.  Just fix it.  I don't care if we get back.  We don't get back crashing on the moon.  Fuck it.  But we need all three people to make...  Yes, Jimmy?  We need all three people to make this maneuver.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  I can't fire the retro rockets and do the guns at the same time.  I don't care.  Have someone else do it.  Right.  But there's only three of us.  It says right in the manual. 
[01:48:00]  We need all three.  I don't want to huff and puff and wreck the bit.  That's why I'm just sitting back and shut my face.  What bit?  This is called just...  I'm really irritated.  This is called filler.  Are you kidding me?  You think anyone's interested in what Dee Dee has to say?  Yes.  Aww.  Dee Dee, I apologize for all of you.  Poor Norton, man.  He needs to learn how to release his anger.  Oh, he does that quite well.  Just in ways that we don't want to know about.  Big, creamy batches of anger.  Yeah. 
[01:48:30]  All right.  Well, one of the guys just came in with a screwdriver.  That's not a good sign.  It's really awful.  Usually they have some kind of weird electrical things.  A screwdriver is not a good sign.  That means hardware is being changed out.  They usually have that thing that helps you look for water in the desert.  You know, a divining rod.  Right.  A metal detector.  They're waving it around.  It all sounds like...  I've got to tell you.  All right.  Dee Dee, do we have a few more minutes with you?  No.  Yeah.  Just a few, though, boys.  All right.  Can you tell us about the movie you're working on? 
[01:49:00]  Oh.  Yeah, well, you know about my fucked up life, right?  Of course.  Well, I think we've just scratched the surface.  Well, it's kind of like, based on that, it's called Lubricated in Lunacy.  It's not a porn, because I have the word lubricated.  But it's just about alcoholism, addiction, and stuff like that.  Oh, my God.  There goes that laugh again.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Yeah.  Is it going to be some kind of low-budget film or something? 
[01:49:30]  No, it's not going to be low-budget.  It would be mediocre.  I thought I gave Steve a copy of the movie treatment, but I guess I didn't, so I'll send it to you.  And it's based on your life?  Pretty much, it starts from when I was Amy Carter's look-alike.  Yeah.  And worked with Barbara Eden.  Were you touched as a child?  No.  You worked with Barbara Eden?  At the Chicago Auto Show.  Oh, right, at the Auto Show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That means you sat next to her.  She signed autographs.  My dad had to drag me away from her, so.  Really?  Yeah, because in my head at that time, she wasn't Barbara. 
[01:50:00]  She was Jeannie, so I wanted her to do some magic.  And so she was just getting annoyed with me, because I was being a kid.  Right.  She doesn't, I don't know.  She seems like she wouldn't have a sense of humor.  Um, yeah, she didn't then.  I just remember her eyes rolling back, like, get this kid out of here.  And my dad pulling me away, saying, come on, Jeannie's busy.  And then the movie goes through your life as you grow up and.  And get, and get my act together and shit like that, yeah.  Yeah, but the fun part is you without your act.  Yeah, when I got married in Vegas and had to deal with the counterfeit money and ended 
[01:50:30]  up in New Orleans.  Yeah, for the new listeners, Dee Dee blacked out, went to Vegas, got married to a counterfeiter.  Yeah, from England, from England.  From England, didn't remember she even married the guy.  And then decided, what the hell, I'm married, I might as well give this a shot.  I'll make it work.  And then he went skiing or something, and she found lots and lots of money and decided  to.  God, you have a good memory.  To, uh, a good memory, Jesus.  No, I mean, not many people would remember all that.  You remember it a lot.  Of course. 
[01:51:00]  It was one of the best stories ever.  And then, uh, I don't know, and then you got caught by, like, the FBI when you tried  to, what, deposit the money or something?  Uh, and that's Secret Service, actually.  Secret Service, yeah.  So.  All right.  Well, Dee Dee, uh, what else, I mean, could you give us another little bit that will be  in the movie?  Um.  Will the UPS guy, uh, oh yeah, the UPS guy that you were banging?  Actually, um, I talked to one of the producers about that, and they kind of want, one of them  wants to add it.  So, yeah, that might be in there. 
[01:51:30]  It should be in there, because it shows that I can have fun when I'm sober.  Yeah, uh, she used to bang the UPS, uh, man.  Off and on, you know.  Off and on.  What the hell?  Get a nice little touch of the movie.  And, uh, is, how about another, uh, another, you know, another story, maybe, that you haven't  told yet?  Or maybe, like, a little tease, and then we can get into it at a later time.  Oh, my God.  Um.  You know how to do radio.  How about a tease, and then the next time you're on the air, we'll, uh, we'll get to  the bottom of another Dee Dee story.  I went out with a karate instructor once, and ended up in the emergency room. 
[01:52:00]  Oof.  Wow, that's a good tease.  What happened?  You had to sign paperwork until your arm got numb?  Oh, it's a tease.  I can't tell you.  Hi, Jimmy.  Welcome back to the program.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi, Dee Dee.  I'm just testing the, uh.  Uh-uh.  It's a tease.  I can't tell you.  I've got to save it for next time.  Yep.  All good things.  Well, can we get that story later today?  Um, after 10 a.m.  when I'm out of rush hour.  10 a.m.  when you're out of rush hour.  All right, that's a deal.  Eastern Standard Time.  So you went out with a karate instructor, and you ended up in the hospital. 
[01:52:30]  And ended up in an emergency room.  All right, nice.  That's good.  We'll find out what that's all about at 10 o'clock.  Yes.  All right, Dee Dee.  You have a wonderful, um, show there.  I've got to go do traffic.  I'm delirious.  I'm on medication.  All right.  I wish I was.  Oh, my God.  Bye, Dee Dee.  All right, yeah, Anthony's going to go.  Bye, Norton.  Was that Norton?  Yes.  He's got a sexy voice this morning.  Bye, Norton.  Bye, Dee Dee.  Bye, Dee Dee.  Okay, there goes.  Okay, got to go.  Wait, Dee Dee, Dee.  Yeah, yeah, it was. 
[01:53:00]  That was too easy.  You know when you've got to take a dump, and you're driving home, and you go, I've got to  take a dump.  And you get right in your driveway, and that's when it really gets bad.  Yep.  Because you know it's like coming up.  As I look at the clock and know that in 15 minutes or so, I will be seeing a dentist,  the pain is overwhelming.  It is now the torture of like a water torture, where I could feel this pounding, and it is 
[01:53:30]  very difficult to just even sit here.  I'm sure it's not the pain of doing this awful show today.  No.  And it's funny you mentioned taking dumps.  There's been times where I've had like gas pains, and my stomach has been cramping so  bad, that I'm standing stiff-legged in front of the toilet, and I have to unbuckle the  belt, and then just like kind of move until the...  I can't even sit, because as I'm sitting, I'm going to cramp up and shit in my pants  and on my bath mat.  So you've got to do that sit move really quick?  No, I'll actually just kind of stand there stiffly, unbuckle my pants, and like stiff 
[01:54:00]  arm my pants down, and then like just wait until the gas subsides for a second, and then  sit and release.  You ever start to release on the way down?  Oh, yes, I have.  The sound of releasing, there it is.  Those are the good ones.  Yeah.  Very good.  Very, very good.  Who is this out there now?  What?  That's Mindy.  Oh.  Who's the chick? 
[01:54:30]  Hi, Mindy.  She's hot.  Who is she?  From the Kids Channel.  From the Kids Channel?  She's from the Kids Channel?  What?  What does she do?  Where is she?  She just sat down at that cubicle.  Is she hot?  Yeah?  Kids Channel, huh?  All right, we'll take a break so you can figure out...  Can we get her in here?  Want to get her in?  Can you say hello to another ex-employee we haven't met?  Why not?  Yeah, all right.  I'd like to say hi to her.  Look at Jimmy.  All of a sudden, his eyes...  You realize you don't have a shot, right?  Why do this to yourself?  Might. 
[01:55:00]  She doesn't have a shot.  That's good.  I like your confidence.  Well...  Why is Master Poe in here?  Because I'm just explaining who this is.  Oh, who is he?  It's Mindy.  What?  All right.  Thank you, Poe.  Well, Ben told me to come and tell you.  Yeah, what's...  Why won't...  Uh, problem?  Eric?  Why do these are secretive?  Eric's waving his hands.  Well, you could tell us what the problem is.  Yeah, you have to wave it off.  Have someone on the air.  Yeah, who is she?  Yuri?  Do you understand, Eric?  You've been here about six, seven months now.  We do everything on the air. 
[01:55:30]  So when you come in like, oh...  Yeah.  No.  Instead of giving us the signs, you...  She would rather not.  She doesn't want to...  She said, I'm not doing another cricket.  And I said, you don't have to.  They just want to say hi.  And she's like, I would rather not.  All right.  That's all.  That's it.  Nothing more...  You went into a panic, though.  I just went like that.  He's waving off.  No.  No.  Don't go running into the street.  Don't.  Don't.  Grab the child.  Oh, please.  Incidentally, I did listen to that whole segment.  It was very good.  He didn't know it was A-Rod until after. 
[01:56:00]  He wasn't running towards A-Rod for an autograph.  See?  He didn't know until after.  That's bullshit.  No, it's not.  The kid said that.  He said, wait, are you A-Rod?  As soon as these guys walk out of the Ritz-Carlton, the whole area goes nuts because they're just  waiting around for the Yankee players to leave the hotel.  But then A-Rod said, well, you want to meet some more Yankees?  And they introduced him to Randy Johnson, Jorge Posada, and somebody else.  Invited him down to a Yankee game at the stadium.  Randy had a good game last night, Jim, huh?  Five earned runs.  I don't like...  No one's more against Randy Johnson being here than me.  Nobody wanted him less than I did.  And as far as Ben saying we, like he's a big Red Sox fan, he had this alleged ticket for 
[01:56:30]  opening day and gave it to somebody when they're getting the World Series ring.  What kind of fan would do that?  I had the ticket.  I had the ticket because I had friends in town that I was eating lunch with and I didn't  want to hang out with my friends.  I don't care about going to the game.  I'd rather watch sports on TV.  I watch every Pats game on TV.  I never go to Pats games.  What friends do you have that were in town?  What will you have as a matter of?  I don't care about going to the game.  Ben, I love you.  You know that.  But we all think you just never had that ticket.  I definitely had the ticket.  It was a grandstand.  The ticket sucked down.  It was kind of an imaginary ticket. 
[01:57:00]  No, I had the ticket.  You should have run off a mimeograph of it.  Why wouldn't you give it to one of us?  It wasn't for me.  It was given to me, but it wouldn't be for me to give to you.  You understand what I'm saying?  Not at all.  Okay.  But, yeah.  Okay.  All right.  When we get back.  And Patrice should be here any minute, too.  And then Anthony, we can send Anthony to the dentist.  Yeah.  What a weird week of radio, I got to tell you.  But when we get back.  Goldberg.  Goldberg.  I like that in my dentist.  What's that, Ant? 
[01:57:30]  A name like Goldberg.  It's a good name for a dentist.  So you're going to go upstairs, and Goldberg is going to help your pain.  Yeah.  Well, not the wrestler.  That would be odd, huh?  Imagine.  Get up there, and now this could take a horrible turn.  Maybe, yeah.  Hulk Hogan's up there, and he sings Hulkster in heaven until you kill yourself.  And the pain is gone.  Oh, my God.  They're teasing in the paper today that Hulk Hogan is going back to actually wrestling.  Yeah.  He's going to be part of WrestleMania.  But.  Does anyone want to see that?  But he's been in a suit and stuff, right?  He's not really wrestling yet. 
[01:58:00]  He wrestled.  Let me tell you, brother.  Shut up.  He kicked the WWE's new Arab character.  He came out during WrestleMania and, you know, kicked his ass and posed for like 20 minutes  to, I'm a real American.  And he's wrestling on Monday as a tag team with Shawn Michaels.  You know, wrestling fans, you're a bunch of fucking cornballs.  You really are a bunch of cornballs.  Dude, talk directly to one of them.  Yeah, there you go.  I'm proud to be an American.  Muscle.  Ka-flash.  Ka-flash.  Ka-flash.  Ka-flash. 
[01:58:30]  Ka-flash.  Ka-flash.  Ka-flash.  Ka-flash.  Is that, what is this, the 50s?  Yeah, exactly.  What, are they photographing Kong?  That's that raging bull thing.  Ka-flash.  Ka-flash.  They're coming in.  Let them come in.  Hold it.  How corny.  I'm proud to be an American.  Makes the muscle with the flag draped.  Did you get a little tear rolling down your fat faces, did you?  Stupid asses.  Oh, my God.  What a bunch of cornballs.  Eric enjoys his wrestling. 
[01:59:00]  I'm not saying, look, I do certain things about wrestling.  There was a time Anthony and I really enjoyed, uh...  And me too.  But then you know what?  I got hair one on my dick, and that ended that.  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.  As soon as I discovered girls, I could care less about Bob Backlund.  All right, what is it?  And his heavy breathing.  That's that song  Oh my god, I'm getting goosebumps 
[01:59:30]  Oh yeah  Comes out to this  Oh, the whole crowd cheers  He sure is  Red, white, blue  Oh, here we go  That's good music if you're in 1983  Woo!  Bolster  When it comes crashing down and it hurts inside  Yeah  Shut up and listen to the words  Yeah 
[02:00:00]  Good song  If you hurt my friends  Then you hurt my pride  I gotta be a man  I can't let it slide  I am a real American  Yeah  You are a real American  Because only in this country  Can you succeed  Without any visible talent whatsoever  Thunder lips  What about some of the other Hulkster songs? 
[02:00:30]  Dude  Would they be in there?  Remember the one he sang  To the kid, right?  He actually sang it  That's what I was saying  Hulkster in Heaven  No, that was the mellow one  By the way  There's a rockin' one  Cowboy from Iowa  I want to get him on the program here  He has something to say to Jimmy  Cowboy  Hey, man  Cowboy  Yeah  Yeah  What's up, Cowboy?  Yeah, hey  What's this about  All people that watch wrestling are idiots  Don't you guys know that wrestling is the number one rated program on TV right now? 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, exactly  That proves my point, buddy  It does prove my point  In a weird way  Do you know that in the 40s  Jew killing was the number one rated activity among blonde haired people?  No, it didn't make it right  It didn't make it good  It didn't make it a worthwhile activity  Wow, wow  Okay  I've got to go to the dentist for a couple of minutes  Oh, yeah  Keep that humor to a minimum  Brian, what's up?  Is it safe?  Is it safe?  No, no, it's very dangerous  Be very careful  Is it safe? 
[02:01:30]  It's safe  Brian?  Yeah  Enjoy your youth  It's the last time nobody will expect anything of you  All right  Great movie  We'll have Hulk Hogan songs for Monday's show, Anthony  All right  Thank you  There's a big tease for Monday's radio show  Just the lyrics in that  Something about hide  I can't let it slide  And just all of these mullet-wearing idiots  Clap into the words  And probably like  He's the type that would hold the mic out  And they'd all go  I'm a real American  That rocks 
[02:02:00]  There's nothing wrong with it, Jimmy  That bothers me on a level  It almost makes my back and spine hurt  It's the type of band where it's just  You can't even describe how awful it is  Yep  It's got to be like losing a child  That's the only thing I can say it must be like  Let's go to Brian  Hey, Brian  Hey, I just wanted to thank A-Rod for averting another tragedy in Don Geronimo's driveway  Wouldn't that be great if A-Rod was there and scooped up little Rudy? 
[02:02:30]  Just in time  Just in time  That could be the biggest laugh of the day, Brian  Very good  Also, when that truck driver's pulling his serious radio out of a box  I just want to say, drag it, faggot  On and out  Alright, Anthony from Connecticut  Anthony  Hey, Jimmy  I've been watching wrestling since I was five years old  Yet I'm a cornball  But you suck dick under a porch  And you're not a faggot?  Dude, I'm not saying that there aren't inconsistencies in my philosophies  But I don't  Exactly 
[02:03:00]  I did that when I was five, dude  I don't still blow people under porches  And even if I did  I wouldn't have popped my head out of his lap and said  I'm a real American  I would have finished my duty  Well, Piper's pit never made me give a hummer  So I don't know  I like wrestling, man  I'm not saying wrestling itself  I'm saying that mentality, dude  That whole, you know, I'm an American  I'm an American  Alright  Jimmy  Oh, hey  Yeah  More in the world than I hate  It's like when you have a sports fan  Or when they team with  They say we won  Like you fucking ate dirt and slipped to second base to win that race

You didn't watch any Dallas Cowboy games last year  You admitted that on there  I'm not sure  I watch them when they're on  But you have to realize  I watch them when they're on  Shut up  You're not a true fan  If they're not on in my  It's called getting the package  I don't have the package  So you get it  Then don't call yourself a true fan  I don't have sports packages ever  You don't even watch the Yankee games

[02:08:00]  I think ever  Yeah, he's hurting  Ever  He's hurting  So, uh  I think Eric's going upstairs  And we'll get an update in a few seconds here  But first, we've got to go to Oklahoma City  And talk to Mark  Mark, what's up?  Hey, boys  What's going on?  Hey  Hi, Mark  Hey, Jimmy  You funny, fat-titted fuck  Thank you, Mark  That was hurtful  I hope not  It wasn't meant to be  I'm just teasing  I was just curious  Since Howie's doing XM spots for you guys  Are you guys going to do serious spots for him?  Fuck no  You're listening to real guys 
[02:08:30]  We're not phonies  One moment he's plugging how great XM Satellite Radio is  The next he's signing a deal with the competitor  You know, he's just a big, fat, fucking phony  That's looking more like an old lady every day  Everyone knows it  They just don't want to admit it  Let's see  Let's say hi to Tim  Hey, Tim, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  I just wanted to  Oh, by the way, that wasn't an accurate slam  He's not fat  I'm sorry  Okay  Who?  How are you?  Yeah  Tim, go ahead 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, this is for Jimmy  Jimmy, you know what I hate about?  You know, people like  Oh, I'm a real American  You know, like  I only drink Starbucks coffee  Yeah, I know  It is kind of a prima donna-ish  Oh, yeah  Well  You didn't have to hang up, sir  I know, Jesus  We would have went with it  We would have let you slam him a little more  I wouldn't have minded to the  Alright, here's the deal  Why don't we get Patrice in here  Also, um  Patricky  Eric is, uh  Going up to the dentist with Anthony as well  I thought we were going to kill two birds with one stone 
[02:09:30]  But it turns out that Eric is actually going to be the reporter on the scene  What do you mean?  Well, we all know that Eric had a bad breath problem  I thought he was finally taking care of the situation  I figured, what the hell?  Is it gone?  Actually, I think it's much better these days  No?  Ben?  Ben apparently doesn't think so  I don't know  Oh, you're not on?  Turn about on  I don't know  Sometimes it is  Someone, I don't know who it is  Someone in our office has bad breath on a daily basis  So it's one of these guys  It's not, it's after the show I notice it  Really? 
[02:10:00]  So I don't know  Well, we eat a lot of crazy crap during the show  Maybe it's all just kind of  You know how  You know  Bumbling in our mouths  You know, here's the test you do  When you smell it  Look at who's addressing you  And that would be the test that their breath is bad  There you go  How is it a mystery as to whose breath is bad?  You can't just close your eyes and talk  Hey, we got Patrice O'Neill in studio  Good morning, everybody  I'm going to treat you like a star  Thank you very much  You deserve to be  Well, you deserve to be treated like a star  I always knew it  I'm just looking at Anthony's nasty oral gel 
[02:10:30]  Anthony is  Oh, I'm pinching him rubbing his stupid gums  His index finger  Trying to be a professional  That's funny  You don't know the half of it  He has orange  What?  Look at  Read all the stuff he's got over there  He's got an orange gel  That's his breakfast that he never got to  Trying to do a nice impression  Oh, oh  Brush your teeth, Anthony 
[02:11:00]  He's got  It's easy  He's got peroxide  He's got orange gel  What's that other thing?  Oh  And a banana because he can't chew  Right  And he couldn't even try the banana today  Then he's got Advil  And a leave  And what's that over there?  There's something else  Did I get it all?  He's got bottles of relief  He's gargling with poison 
[02:11:30]  Because he won't floss  He won't floss  Oh, my God  Oh, Anthony, man  Do you like Anthony's seat, by the way?  Oh, it's great, man  Usually we give you the crappy seat  But look, you've got the nice chair and everything  Look, you've got your own sound machine  You do whatever you want over there  Just start pushing buttons  Let's see if we can find an impression of Anthony upstairs 
[02:12:00]  It's my rifle, this is my gun  Nope, that ain't it  Dude, Jesus  If you're going to push the button, they've got to make some kind of sense  Wait, I see Odeer  Oh, all right, well  Oh, so this is all his stuff  What you say is, push Odeer  You say, well, this is what Anthony is going through right now  And then you hit  Oh, Odeer is right on the thing  Yeah, but set it up first  Let's go, this is, you know  Oh, okay  Yeah, here you go  Go ahead  Okay, this is what Anthony is going through right now 
[02:12:30]  This is my rifle  No  Wait, wait, wait  I'm going to put this mine  What?  I'm going to put this one  This is my rifle  There are many like it, but this one is mine  This is right here  All right  How about you try for a third time, Patrice?  See, it's not that easy being the head guy  This is his cold, just in case 
[02:13:00]  Because he knows he has bad teeth  He had to have somebody come in and take his place  And he made sure it was going to be  Oh, yeah  That's not it  This is my rifle, this is my gun  No, I switched it  This is the guy with bad breath, by the way  What's his name?  His brother's hovering over me like a volder  See how easy that was, Ben?  He had a goggle with his orange gel  Yeah, take his garage side, man  On the rocks  All right, try it again 
[02:13:30]  I want this one  Right here, man  Set it up, though  Go ahead  Okay, Anthony's upstairs  Getting his teeth done  This is what he sounds like  That makes more sense, don't it?  That worked, you know  But it wasn't as funny  This is my rifle  Oh, dear, it would have been good  It was really funny  It was after you said that  Watching the thing  He'll try to help you  But not bend 
[02:14:00]  Lean in stiff  Take care, dear rotten mouth  All right, let's go upstairs  See what's going on  Anthony  Yes  Hi, Anthony  You guys are a real fucking riot  The trees are playing with my toys  So what's going on up there, Anthony?  Well, I'm sitting in the dentist's chair  All right  I've just taken my x-rays  And I'm staring at the x-ray of the tooth in question right now 
[02:14:30]  Wait a minute, you got in to see the dentist that fast?  Yes  I'm changing dentists immediately  Yeah, this guy's pretty good  You didn't have to read magazines or any of that crap?  No, I'm filling out the paperwork as I'm sitting in the chair  And actually getting the x-rays  So it worked out pretty well  Did he get the Novocaine?  No, not yet  I'm still in like utter pain  I'm waiting  They're holding off  I don't know why  Just give me the shot  I need the shot  Why don't you just go to this guy upstairs?  Why don't you just make him the dentist? 
[02:15:00]  If he's right upstairs  This is easiest for everyone  Yeah  I should  You're going to be canceling your other appointment now?  I don't know  I've got to see what this guy does  If it's a temporary thing, you know  Then I've got to go to a dentist and get it fixed  But if, you know, he knows what he's doing  And it's permanent  Then, yeah, this will be my new dentist  Right upstairs  And he's a Jew  The dentist is a Jew  Which is very, very good  Shocking, yeah  Of course  What did Patrice say?  You don't want your dentist's name to be like Tyrone Smith  Yeah 
[02:15:30]  Yeah  Which one of your teeth hurts?  Oh, shit  I shouldn't be prepared for that one  We're going to have two berserk  Oh, man  That's funny, man  Yeah, like, you know  There's some races that are good at doing certain jobs in life  And the Jews pretty much have the dentistry tied up  And I like that 
[02:16:00]  All right  So does this mouth and soil medicine work?  Yeah  No  That stuff down there, like ambasol and stuff?  No, that doesn't work  I don't know what that's for  You've got a little scratch on your gum  Not for this  Hey, Anthony, why don't you tell Patrice  How you were trying to take care of the pain last night?  Oh, I had a bottle of  Captain Morgan rum  And I was swishing it around by the tooth  And spitting it out in a glass  You know, I can't really laugh  You know you want to laugh at somebody's problems  But I had a toothache  A couple of years  It's not funny 
[02:16:30]  It's the worst pain you'll have  You almost want to dig  Dig something in it and take it out yourself  You know what I'm saying?  So I do feel for you  But you've got to brush three times a day, Anthony  We were trying to get Anthony to chew on tinfoil this morning  Grunting and hurting  First thing in the morning he's miserable  And Jimmy and I were trying to help him out with some things  We think it's like a popcorn kernel stuck in there  Right up against the nerve  I don't see any popcorn kernel 
[02:17:00]  Oh, you're just looking at the x-ray now?  Yeah, I'm looking at the x-rays right in front of me  The way they do it now  It's all done with computer magic there  I'll be the guy  I bite on something  It's got a wire on it  Not like the foot anymore  And it takes the x-ray  And it pops up on a monitor right in front of your face  As he takes the picture  What's he telling you it is  Or he's not saying it?  No one's in the room with me here  So I'm just staring at it  And it's a big mystery to me  They leave it in front of me for a while  So I could look and go  Ew, what the hell is that?  And I don't have any answers  By the way, everyone listening in Alabama  Don't get too excited  You'll have that technology in about 20 years 
[02:17:30]  Well, they don't really need it  The dentist just looks in at the one tooth  And gives you a prognosis  Prognosis is just not a funny word  Don't say it again  The one tooth and gives you a prognosis  Prognosis was the right word, though  It wasn't because you're turning red  You got a little uncomfortable there  You got to make me feel better, man  I'm looking at my x-ray 
[02:18:00]  I see like the cap thing  And then I see like a post  That's going into one of the root holes  And then I see like two root holes  I don't know how they make heads or tails  Is this your first bad tooth, Anthony?  No, years and years ago  I had to get a couple of teeth capped  Oh, okay  So what did you do?  Shouldn't you have did exactly the opposite  So you didn't have this happen again?  No, it just came up like two days ago  It just started hurting out of nowhere  Wow, hereditary teeth 
[02:18:30]  Fine and dandy  And then all of a sudden  We were making fun of  This is what's creepy, Patrice  We were making fun of dentists yesterday  Yeah  And now this tooth that has been fined for 15 years  It acted up  No, evil dentist karma  Well  What are you going to do?  If you want me to explain further  We have this pickled punk  And we think the place is cursed  Oh, this place here?  Yeah  So that's why  I know that sounded like a stretch  But we were talking about  How the place might be cursed  Then Anthony starts making fun of 
[02:19:00]  This dentist that was a pervert  And next thing you know  Anthony has this problem  The x-ray guy  Is that wrong for him  To put his mule in my mouth  And say bite down  Not too hard  No  I'm in such pain  I just want it to go away  So I'm willing to do anything  That would be so nice  If he touches Anthony funny  I really hope I see you  On a lifetime movie  And your eyes are open  But you can't move  Like Serpent in the Rainbow  So you know exactly 
[02:19:30]  What he's doing to you  Oh, boy  Hey, Anthony  Where's Eric?  Getting his teeth cleaned?  No  No  He's right here  Well, we were a little confused  When he decided to go upstairs  And you didn't hear this part  We thought we were going to kill  You know, two birds  With one stone up there  Or is Eric just kind of  Looking around  And going  What is this place?  I've never been to one  What kind of a chair is this? 
[02:20:00]  Oh, you're terrible, man  As soon as you guys walked in  They probably grabbed Eric  And Eric had to say  No, no  I'm not the problem  It's that guy  Oh, you guys make me feel much better  So what?  We're just waiting for some kind of  Yes, sorry  I can't  If there were some tools around  I'd start working on myself  But sorry 
[02:20:30]  Until, you know  The guy comes in  And starts doing it  It's pretty much, you know  What kind of magazines?  I can't fill out my paperwork  No, I bypassed the whole  Waiting room magazine thing  And everything  Oh, so you're just  Right in the room?  Yeah, that's close enough  For paperwork  They're taking my paperwork  Oh, I got some other stuff  I got to fill out  On the other page, huh?  Oh, I miss  I've been talking  On the radio, sir  Maybe I should fill out  Some of this paper  You're getting me in trouble  What are some of the questions  You got to fill out? 
[02:21:00]  Just the name  Social security number  Crap like that  You can fill out all the time  Why are you now seeking  Dental treatment?  Ow!  That's all I'm writing  Patrice, do you realize  This is a national talk show?  Yeah  We're talking about his band  Yeah, this is it  This is what we do  Why don't you have  Master Poe kick it out?  We got everyone bamboozled  Oh, man 
[02:21:30]  All right, well  Anthony's bad tooth on this day  Anthony's bad tooth, yes  Anthony, you know  We want to do the trainable audio  But I don't think  We should do it without you  Got away, Fran  Aw, damn  Can they shoot a little  No game for the show  And then go back up?  You can hear  Maybe we can do it  Just this way  Until they call you in  For the next  The next thing  Okay  I'll listen in  You want to listen in?  Mm-hmm  All right  What?  What happened?  What's that?  Hulkster in heaven 
[02:22:00]  Did you want to hear that?  Now?  No  I just  Oh, all right  All right  Patrice  Anthony, what is this audio again?  I know you don't want to talk  But it's from what?  The early 70s?  No, the early 60s?  It's like early 60s  Yeah, they called them trainables  Yeah  Basically retards that they felt like  They could train  To be part of society  Patrice  Oh  And they had these  Instructional films  And some of these films  Are up on  Foundrymusic.com right now  And so, you know 
[02:22:30]  These trainables  They were called trainables  Mm-hmm  Had questions about things  That happened  You know  Sexually  And then they would have people  Guide them through  Through the answer  To their problem  I'm listening  I'm just filling out paperwork  Sorry  Oh, okay  So we can start with  The I'm Sticky one again  This will be the third time  We've played the I'm Sticky  Oh, get why  Oh, so Patrice could hear it  Yeah, just so Patrice could hear it  Basically, this kid  This kid woke up sticky 
[02:23:00]  And he's retarded  He's retarded  But they call them trainables  He's a trainable  Okay  So now some adult figure  Is going to explain  What happened to him  Patrice thinks  This is some gag  This is not a real deal  This is  These are real videos  They were using to show you  That you could train retards  To be like  How you talk to retarded people  And how you help them  Assimilate into society  These are real  From the 60s  Trainables  Yes  Okay  Tom, Tom  Oh, wait, wait, wait  Yes, Tom  Didn't have a cue 
[02:23:30]  One, one, Opie  I'm sorry  See, I can't do this  Without it today  Burning on urination  No  All right, here we go  Hey, Frank  How come you haven't gotten up yet?  I'm waiting for 30  Oh  What, uh  When did that happen?  Did it happen during the night?  Or did it just happen now?  Do you know?  No  No  No  Well, if you're sticky  Maybe it was a wet dream  Do you know what a wet dream is?  No  Well, you know 
[02:24:00]  How old are you now?  You're  You must be about  I see the face you're making, Patrice  You know, as you get older  Things like that become sadder  Like when I was 18  I'd just be laughing at this little retard sitting around  Yeah, I'm stinky  But it's like, oh, God  The doctor sounds so creepy  It's not even a doctor  It's just an older gentleman that's around the house  They don't explain who he is  Wait, Anthony's getting his prognosis 
[02:24:30]  You don't know what caused that?  I got a little, uh  I got a little infection around one of my, uh  My tooth gum things  Root things  Oh  A root  What's this little thing here?  Well  Is that a pustule?  Yeah, the tooth had a root canal  It's reinfected  There's a dark little shadow around the tooth where it's infected  But shouldn't something have started that? 
[02:25:00]  That could be, like, pulled out of there?  Like, what would start an infection like that?  Yeah  All right  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm  Hold on  You're going to give me Novocaine?  Oh, he's going to numb me out  What can they do for your tooth, though?  What's he going to do for it?  I don't know  He's got to look around  Antibiotics  Yeah  That's it  Antibiotic, Doc?  Does that seem to be with the, uh  Yeah  Right 
[02:25:30]  Oh, boy  I think I'm going to get a needle  Ask him how your tooth gets really infected  I don't know  Yeah, ask him, man  We can learn something today  Yeah, like, how  What do you do to keep it from getting infected?  What if I dip down on it hard and something  Could that have started this whole ball rolling?  A bit hurting?  If I dip down hard?  No  No, probably not  That's why I'm not a dentist  I'm a stupid radio guy  Nothing I did  Oh, good  It's not my responsibility  Hey, Anthony  A lot of suggestions coming in  Tony from California  Have Ant do a Voss impression  After you get the shot of Novocaine  I won't have a choice 
[02:26:00]  I'm reclined now  And I'm waiting for my, uh  Oh, please  Novocaine  I want to see how wimpy you are  He's got to do the needle live  Oh, I hate needles  Oh, I hate them  But it's going to make the pain go away  Oh, it'll make the pain go away  I love when the pain goes away  All right, what's happening, Anthony?  What's happening?  Well, he's going around  He's getting all the good stuff  Oh, first he puts this Q-tip thing 
[02:26:30]  Dips it in some red stuff  And then rubs it on the gum, I guess  Hey, Ant, put your hand on the end of the chair  Where his cock can brush into it  Okay  Here we go  Here we go, listen  I'm opening, yeah  Okay  Uh-huh  Uh-huh  Uh-huh  Uh-oh  Oh, you've got to put the needle in that nerve  In the back of my jaw  Oh, I hate that one 
[02:27:00]  It makes my whole jaw numb  And half your throat  No  I thought it was going to be the localized one  But he's putting it in that nerve that runs in the jaw  I'm not sure it'll work  It won't work, though  Okay  Give me the good one then, Doc  Here we go  I hate this one  Here we go  You ever have this one out?  Uh, yes  It makes your  And it makes half your throat numb, too, right?  It almost  You can't swallow  Oh, it's awful  Yeah, you have a hard time swallowing 
[02:27:30]  By the way, someone is suggesting  You might have Ben's cell phone  Caught in  Under that cap  I hear you  All right, here we go  Let's listen in  I'm still numbing the thing out  With a Q-tip  Okay  Uh-huh  Is this numb enough  So it doesn't hurt  When you put the needle in, Doc?  Yeah, that's to disinfect, Anthony  Disinfect  I'll be comfortable  But it's a little too late for that  Oh, I'm such a pussy  Excuse my language here, Doc 
[02:28:00]  I'm not a potty mouth  Oh, God  You have XM satellite radio?  You do?  You ever listen to the Opie and Anthony show?  Oh, he does  Oh, my God  He knows who I am  I hope he's a fan  Oh, Jesus  Ask that Jew thief  Is he going to take your insurance?  Patrice, shut up  Yeah  Tell that Christ killer  To put more stuff to numbers  Don't make me laugh  Tell that cheap Jew you're paying in cash 
[02:28:30]  Okay  Okay  Okay, here comes the needle  All right  Oh, God  All right, Doc  Be gentle  Uh-huh  As a representative of Anthony's family  I say we pull the plug  Now listen for a zipper 
[02:29:00]  Why are we playing the Terry Schiavo audio?  Jesus  God, how much  What happened to Anthony?  How much did you put in there, Doc?  Hopefully enough  Oh, I hope so  By the way, you just said what?  What?  Yes  Maybe I'd brush my teeth with Novocaine 
[02:29:30]  No, that was actually a pretty painless needle that he did there  Oh, look at that  Jiggling  That's going to be a great endorsement for the fine dentist  Yeah, let me rinse  Mm-hmm  Oh, did you hear that?  That was me rinsing  Is it drooling down your  Oh, not yet  Drooling down your lip yet?  God, that one  It's that one that they've got to give you way in the back of the jaw  That makes the whole  Oh, there goes the tip of my tongue  Okay  Oh, this is great 
[02:30:00]  You want to buy a dryer door?  Dude, you've been drug-free 17 years  Oh, that is weird, yeah  It's all going numb now  Anthony, you've got to do some Dudley Moore  Oh, yeah, we can talk about that, Doc  Yeah, sure  Yeah  Root canal got reinfected  Root canal got reinfected  Oh  There are basically three options  Three options?  Oh, no  Here are the options  Try and redo the root canal, huh? 
[02:30:30]  Uh-huh  If you look at the nerve  Yeah  It goes all the way down here  Yeah, I see  It goes down very far  Yeah, yeah  If you look at the root canal filling  It doesn't go all the way down to the end of the root canal  Oh  They didn't take out the whole nerve  A little tissue left in that root  Right, that's what we got  Right  It's a head dentist  His body's trying to reject it  Uh-huh  Oh, his body's trying to reject it  Nice  Take off the crown  Uh-oh  Drill back down through the root canal  Delicious 
[02:31:00]  Try to do it again  Yeah  Is that what he would recommend?  Yeah  That's what he recommends?  Well, that's what we go for  I guess the other option is yanking the tooth out, huh?  The other option is actually surgically going down the bone  Boom  And actually removing part of the bone  Why would we want to do that?  Remove part of the bone?  Oh, okay  But it's an option  It's an option  And the third is  I wouldn't want to take the tooth out  No, either  I kind of like it  Let me talk to Dr. Weinstein for a minute  Why can't you just get rid of the nerve? 
[02:31:30]  Are you dissing my old dentist?  I just want to ask him that there's a black man questioning his authority here  It's a B-cap  It's an A-cap  A-cap, that's a B-cap  It's a B-cap  How? The guy's dissing my old dentist  Who put the original cap in  That guy's worked  He didn't take the nerve out, Anthony  Yeah, he didn't take the nerve out  And he didn't, uh  It's a bad cap  It doesn't go all the way over  Jesus  There's probably still gauze sticking out of it  Little dentist stuck  Was your dentist named Tyrone?  Don't, ah  Rook now, specialist 
[02:32:00]  You don't do that, huh?  What can you do for me, like, now?  Aside from numbing my entire jaw  That's pretty much it  Can you write me a prescription for, um  Morphine?  Morphine, I love that stuff  No, oh God, I'm talking like Voss  I swear  No, we can hear it  All of a sudden I have  I'm three shades darker  And I'm smoking  Adjust the bite 
[02:32:30]  So I'm not biting down on it  So much  Uh-huh, yeah  Little Buddy Hinton's  Gonna come up to me  And go, baby talk  Baby talk  It's a wonder you can walk  When it's time to change  All right  I don't know what job  And should the antibiotic stock  Uh, you know  Antibiotic will knock it out  It'll knock out the infection  But it  But  Because when I stop  It'll just come back  If there's some  Umu-wak-yad  In the, uh  In the root 
[02:33:00]  That was, um  That was, uh  Yiddish, by the way  Okay, Italian  I'm trying to make you  My brother here  Help me out  Hey, Anthony  Is he gonna write you  A prescription for pain medication  When he's not controlling  The world's banks?  Jimmy, shut up  Okay, I  Well, Doc  I probably can't hold this  While you're doing this, right?  Oh, I can't  I'm trying to get off  On my own show  And he says it's fine  Wait, what is he  Gonna do for you, Anthony?  He's gonna, uh 
[02:33:30]  Fix the crown  So I'm not biting down  On it, uh, so much  All right  Oh  Hey, can  Can you do, uh  Some Dudley Moore?  No, I'm not doing  Impressions  While I'm in the  Dentist chair  Yeah  But in the movie  Ten, Dudley Moore  Went to the dentist  And his whole face  Was numb  And  Yeah  And you do a good  Dudley Moore  And I just  Oh, I got  I got  Hold on  I just lit down  On some carbon paper  Oh, that's to  Check the bite  Yeah  Here we go 
[02:34:00]  Listen in  Oh  God  I hate that noise  Hey, Norton  Does that sound like  Pitch?  Norton's getting  Turned on  Sounds like a  Young girl's  Bladder to me  Someone is saying 
[02:34:30]  You're going to sound  Like a trainable  In a few minutes  Uh-huh  All right  Here we go again  Uh, he's just  Smoothing down the bite  That's all he's doing  Yeah  Yeah  I thought he might be  Drilling something  But  No, he's not helping you  What about the pain?  Hey, we gotta get this  Stock, uh, home system  Hey, Anthony 
[02:35:00]  What is he going to do  For Eric?  Does he have  Lavoris  Does he have  Lavoris  Hooked up to a fire hose?  God, Eric's going to  Hate us  When he listens  To the replay  Later on  He has no idea  He has no idea  He's checking the bite 
[02:35:30]  I'm assuming  Nope  Oh  He's going back in  Yeah  No pain 
[02:36:00]  This is great  Hey, Anthony  Yeah  The next time you talk to him  I want you to address him  Like Pesci addressed De Niro  In the desert  In Casino  Wow  I am so numbed out  That rules  But when this  Goes off, Doc  It's really going to hurt  I took one of those  Mutals home with me  Oh, he just  Blinded tooth  Yeah  What?  Yeah, with that little  Tooth sander 
[02:36:30]  Yeah  No, it was the  Drill  Oh, that was a drill  Yep  Whoa  So is he going to give you  Anything for the pain?  Like, to keep you through?  Yeah  Yeah  We've got something  For the pain, right?  They're all very concerned  About pain medication  I don't think for me, though  Yeah, Doc  I'm going to need  About 250 tablets  And to ask him  How long  You're going to have  To take care of this  When's the next time  You're going to have  To come in?  Yeah  What do I do  About getting  A root canal specialist? 
[02:37:00]  A specialist?  Yeah  He just told him  I'm not coming back to you  What can I do  To get a good dentist?  Yeah  No, you know  How they do that  You go to one  And then you go  To the specialist  No, not really  You stay with the guy  That's working on you  Yeah  He's right upstairs  There's no reason  To go to a specialist  Mm-hmm  Well, should you say  In plain English  Not a Jew?  Yeah  That's what specialist  Is in my community  We're going to a specialist  Not a Jew 
[02:37:30]  Hey, Anthony  Anthony  Yeah  Can you ask him  Why he said  What he said  This month  In board reflections?  It's Dr. Goldberg  Hey  He's going to need  A boombox  By the way  Well, we'll give him  Whatever he wants  It's a little  Toothola  Nothing  No, I really do  Feel like boss  Hey, if my prognosis 
[02:38:00]  Joke bombed  Toothola's not  Getting anything  Where's Eric  Through this whole thing?  Yeah, just kind of  Standing behind me  Yeah  Yeah, Doc  You might want to  Check Eric out  They're saying  He should have a look  Yeah, he's one of the producers  And he had a little problem  A couple of months back  Where guys brought in  Some toothpaste  And mouthwash  And stuff 
[02:38:30]  So  They're thinking  Maybe he should be  Looked at  A little bit  You know what's going to be funny  When the crew comes in  The dentist's dressed  Like the Apollo 13 group  They are pounding you  Oh, what is that?  Is Vicodin good?  Oh, yeah  Oh, yeah  Oh, yeah  Oh, yeah  Yeah, it's good stuff  You're getting thumbs up, Doc 
[02:39:00]  Nice prescription  Keith from Indiana  On the phones  And it's going to sound like  Daily Dooley  Daily Dooley  Of course  I really can't talk  This is going to be  A very interesting  Last hour  Oh, God  That's amazing  Is he just about  Done with you?  This afternoon  I should go?  Hmm  I have an appointment  With another dentist, though  Perhaps I should go to her  And then she can send me 
[02:39:30]  I'm going to have to  Do that  Yeah  Well, you know something?  If I try to cancel  My other appointments  You can bill me anyway  How much for this?  Really?  Yeah  How much is this costing you today?  I don't know  I don't care  I'm rich  Well, we want to  We want to know from him  Just in case  You know  People  People, you know  Yeah, he just said  Not something you want to say  Before I write out the bill  Oops  Hey, does this dentist 
[02:40:00]  Seem like he knows  What he's doing?  Yeah  I'll go to him next time  He's right upstairs  I'm sick of going to a while  He's right upstairs  I recommend you now, Jimmy  You got bad teeth, Jimmy?  No, actually  My dentist  Was amazed at how good my teeth are  She was smiling  Saying you have fantastic teeth  And great bone structure  Now what does she say  About the problem with no lips?  Is it easy?  You ought to open your mouth  When you have no lips?  I'm coming back downstairs, gentlemen  All right  Anthony's coming back down  Bye  Couldn't you just let me  Enjoy my little victory  With  I have good teeth? 
[02:40:30]  Open up  Oh, it's open  Oh, it's open  All right  We're going to take a break  When we get back  Anthony will be back in the studio  Patrice is here  And we're going to do  The trainable audio  Cool  And what about  Yeah  Yeah  Hey, yo  What?  Who, where?  Huh?  Like sand through the hourglass  So is the O&A virus  I'm reading the papers today  Billy Joel got out of rehab again

[02:43:30]  Beer  Hot lights  My sweet romantic, she is nice.  It's Martini Steve.  It kind of worked, though.  I pushed the wrong button.  That did work.  It did.  That's great.  That ends that bit, unfortunately.  All right, well, we were blowing until I fucked up.  No, that's actually funny, Martini Steve. 
[02:44:00]  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  The Opie and Anthony Show, XM202.  I say, don't you know?  You say, you don't know.  I say, don't you know?  Take me out, I say, you don't know.  I mean, you're a celebrity, Norty.  Oh, whatever.  Vinny, over there.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  In studio, Patrice O'Neal.  Good morning.  I'm not a celebrity.  Very, very, very funny guy. 
[02:44:30]  Good morning.  Who's playing the Stress Factory all this weekend.  Tonight, tomorrow.  732-545-HA-HA.  H-A-H-A.  And the owner of the club is in studio, Vinny.  Yes, Vinny Brand, also a comic and a good friend.  Very funny guy.  In his own right, yes.  And he was making fun of Patrice O'Neal.  Basically saying, Patrice, say something because you're not selling tickets.  That's what you get.  I can't figure out how to be a celebrity.  Dude, do you know how awful I was?  I went on sale at the Bogota.  Do you understand that, like, an hour and a half later, there was still 40 tickets left? 
[02:45:00]  I'm like, what do I have to do?  You dick.  It's a shame.  I've been on.  Look, if this was the 80s, somebody would know me.  No, no one would know you.  Not even in the 80s.  Oh, look at that awful haircut Vinny has.  Oh, please.  They can't see that radio.  Yes, they can.  They can feel my pain watching that stupid bull cut.  The Frankenstein head.  Oh, Vinny.  That really is a prank phone call kind of head.  Oh, it's a prank call, buddy.  Leave me alone on the fucking phone call. 
[02:45:30]  Without the phone call, your show sucks.  That's the owner of the club telling the headliner he stinks.  He stinks.  Wow, way to sell the show this way.  Here's the part that bothers me.  Patrice is definitely funny.  Nobody fucking cares or knows.  Whatever he's doing, it doesn't fucking help.  I don't get it.  I do not get it.  I'm trying to figure it out.  Tomorrow is sold out.  We have a Sweet 16 party coming in.  150 people.  Great.  Are you serious?  They'll never come to the club again.  So you can get sued.  Oh, is that the wrong crowd for him? 
[02:46:00]  I'm only kidding.  I wouldn't let him come in.  I would not let him come in.  There's young girls in that party.  Well, there you go.  Patrice is not a nice person.  This is best of both worlds.  Vinny's a comic and a club owner.  This is beautiful.  He has an inside track on all the hackness.  Patrice has been on a self-destruction mode lately with the clubs, too.  I love it.  Just chasing people out.  Two weeks ago.  I love it.  Two weeks ago at the comic strip, I'm on the showroom.  I swear to God, a girl left the fucking club crying.  Not just crying.  She was boo-hooing.  She was running out.  And her boyfriend walking out with no balls whatsoever. 
[02:46:30]  You walked how many people that night?  One.  Two.  No.  Her.  No.  Four.  All right.  There were six people in the audience.  Go into comic mode when we were at the comedy clubs doing comedy.  No comic counts that.  Just for that, I'm going to walk the 30 people that are going to show up this weekend.  It's not a matter of not being funny.  It's just that they are offended and upset.  It's not that the jokes aren't good.  It's that he's just a cocksucker and nobody likes him.  No. 
[02:47:00]  That's true.  The people that stay have a great time.  I told you I was in the hospital.  There was a candlelight visual for my death.  They were praying for my death.  Oh, believe me.  As soon as he woke up, people were like, fuck.  Fat motherfucker.  Prayer ain't shit.  You know how many comedy show comics are going?  Come on.  Taking bets on my death.  No, not me.  I'm just paying you with...  Why do you and your friends hate me so much, Vinny?  I don't hate you as much as you think. 
[02:47:30]  But I am paying you with a check this weekend in case you drop on Monday.  Oh, Jesus.  And you know what's making me mad?  That cocked this mother...  He tried that out on me.  Really?  You don't try material out on me and then...  You never said it?  Yeah.  There's two fucking things I want.  Number one, if you drop on Monday, that wouldn't be terrible.  And I'd like that little recorder.  That little fucking Sony recorder.  I'd like that to be mine.  And the funny thing is, I heard it last night when I was there.  He said it again?  He certainly did.  Oh, you're lying to baseball back to the back of your head. 
[02:48:00]  Come prepared.  Oh.  See, that's a tough crowd reference.  Him and his shmommy friends all used to say I never was prepared for a tough crowd.  What is Anthony Clark doing outside the studio?  Who is that guy?  I don't know.  That's a little scary.  Well, Patrice was in the hospital.  That's right.  You're all good now?  Yeah, I mean...  Taking care of yourself?  Yeah.  All right.  No, you're not.  You're not.  You're going to eat like a fucking pig.  You have no control.  No, I'm not.  Wow.  You have no fucking control.  I'll tell you how I'm going to live, not eating that awful food at your goddamn place.  Right or wrong. 
[02:48:30]  That's not...  That's fucking wrong.  Why don't you have the guy pick the fries up off the floor again, man?  With his fingers.  Look at his face, trying to laugh, but he's like, come on, dude.  Don't mess up my fry business.  Jackass.  Oh, 100% pure olive oil.  Yeah, you jackass.  Let me tell you, I've been eating you fries and wings and all kinds of fattening shit.  That's right.  I'm going to write that check.  Have a fucking order to go.  Drink this.  What is it?  It's just grease.  Go ahead.  It's fine.  It's fucking melted lard in a straw. 
[02:49:00]  Apply that to your heart and go to sleep.  This is just awful.  He's just not selling tickets for you, huh, Vinny?  Well, tomorrow's good.  Tonight'll be good.  He'll sell tickets tonight.  Black people don't reserve an event.  They don't fucking blend.  And I'm the only one of one and a half black people Vinny has in the club.  That's not true.  I use Wally Collins, too.  That's the half.  One and a half.  One and a half black guy in a year. 
[02:49:30]  Jesus, Vinny.  No, that's not true.  I use a lot of black comments.  Vinny's got a great club.  I like Vinny's club.  And the food's good.  Is it not good, Opie?  There's a pay phone on the wall.  What are you going to do?  That fucking phone really rocks you.  That really upsets you.  You can't follow a goddamn prank phone call.  I hate that stupid...  I don't have to.  The middle has to, and I feel bad for him.  Vinny N. sees that at his own club, and he does a prank call.  Before he leaves the stage.  Hello.  Here's Mrs. R.  Mrs. R.  This is Johnny from the...  This is the police. 
[02:50:00]  How many police are in New Brunswick?  Every day he's a cop.  I'm a policeman.  Uh-oh.  Speaking of mumbling.  Welcome to Opie and Vinny's show.  Thank you.  That's Vinny from the Stress Factor.  That's Vinny Brand.  Hey, how you doing?  You didn't recognize me?  You don't have to try to care.  He really wants you out of his seat.  Vinny, sit in your old chair.  Vinny, get out of Anthony's seat.  Who told you to sit there? 
[02:50:30]  We did put you out there on purpose.  You want your chair back?  I'll fucking move.  I have to.  Anthony doesn't know what to do with himself when someone's sitting in his seat.  Look at Anthony's fresh new gums.  Mary Jane rotten teeth.  Oh, my God.  You feel better?  Amazing.  Oh, man.  How many of you have a picture?  Ooh, that doesn't look good. 
[02:51:00]  Nice and white, though.  Which one's the bad one?  Both?  The second one, David.  Yeah, this one.  That's the bad one?  This one.  Yeah.  Right down there at the bottom.  Oh, yeah.  He's emailing me this.  He missed a nerve.  How can he miss a nerve?  Did he leave it in on purpose, or is that like a mistake?  The dentist fucked up.  My old dentist.  Must have been a, this is going to be really fun to talk like this.  He can't feel his bottom jaw.  Look at him.  My first dentist was a hack, I guess. 
[02:51:30]  Really?  This guy's good.  Is he?  Oh, yeah.  How can you tell that this thing?  Well, I was in pain, I'm not.  I went to him.  He's the best.  Pain's gone.  He's great.  How can you tell that this right here is something?  So it looks just like a shadow.  He knows.  He knows, huh?  Yeah.  All right.  Training.  How numb are you?  He's a doctor.  Your throat?  No.  Like, the whole right side of my bottom jaw up to the back of the jaw. 
[02:52:00]  Not the throat, though.  Good man.  Now I've got to go for Root Canal right after the show.  But wasn't that a Root Canal?  Oh, you're going to stay in the city and do it here?  Yeah.  The specialist?  Yeah.  Was it not a Root Canal?  The thing he's saying is a problem was a Root Canal?  Yeah, but they didn't go far enough down.  12 years ago when they did it.  You know, it's going to really hurt.  Oof.  No.  Yeah, it's going to really hurt.  Now, once the nerve is gone, it's a wrap. 
[02:52:30]  It's going to hurt.  It won't hurt.  I've had those before.  No, it's going to really hurt.  You're not scaring me.  I've had them before.  You've had them?  I've had them.  Anthony, listen to me.  Crest?  I understand.  Listerine?  Just something.  Do something to your mouth.  Will you just...  I understand.  I've had a couple of Root Canal.  You know, you joke about piss, but it really does clean you right out.  Does it, man?  Norrin doesn't complain.  No.  Pling!  No cavities ever?  I had one.  That's why I'm joking with you because you're in pain. 
[02:53:00]  You have to.  But, you know, I had mine happen in...  I was out of the country.  It's in third world country.  And I had one of those.  In Brazil, right?  Yep.  Oh, boy.  Oh, yeah.  Like three in the morning, I went to one of those favelas.  Those were the City of God to have them.  I went to the City of God to have them.  Little dice.  Little dice was digging a hole in my mouth.  I went there.  It was like three in the morning, and I found a...  I had to.  It was that my pain.  LZ, DTS. 
[02:53:30]  No Novocaine, right?  Just...  No, cocaine.  Yeah.  Coke.  Just rub Coke on your gum.  Rub Coke.  And right down to the Monte Carlo.  Archaic instrument.  They distract you.  A little poor boy tries to steal your wallet when you go, hey, they just fucking pull your  tooth out.  You have to have the doctor fill out a form to ask if he has AIDS.  You only have one cavity in your life? 
[02:54:00]  One, yeah.  Wow.  For genetics, but I got high blood pressure.  Yeah, I was going to say, you're going to take care of anything else.  That's the, that's the, you know...  And they're coughing your teeth and they're going to look great.  Look at his teeth.  They're fucking beautiful.  Beautiful.  His heart's enlarged, but his teeth are fantastic.  Look how big his heart is.  Patrice's always had a big heart.  You missed out.  These two have been just going at it.  Yeah.  Because he owns the club and he's not selling tickets for them this weekend.  Oh my God.  So they're just killing each other.  Oh boy.  Patrice at the stress factory this weekend. 
[02:54:30]  This is Vinny.  He tells me, I don't, I don't, I, this is, April's the worst, I, who, who, April's the  worst time in a month.  It's just the worst time of the year.  That's why I booked you and didn't put pressure on you.  Why don't you book famous people, you jackass?  Book me in the good months.  I thought you had a shot.  You have no shot.  Well, I don't.  No, you don't.  That awful racist community you live in.  Yeah, New Brunswick, known for not liking black people.  They don't.  New Brunswick, Newark, Camden, they all hate black people.  They're known for black people being there, but not for liking them. 
[02:55:00]  Well, maybe those two things go hand in hand.  Oh my God.  Look at Vinny, upset about the fries.  Vinny, don't worry.  Not upset about the fries.  He has delicious fries in the back.  They are fucking good fries.  Vinny, I will say all kidding aside, Vinny's food is good.  And if you don't like it going down, believe me, three hours later, it's great coming up.  How much of my food has been shit under your chest? 
[02:55:30]  Wow!  The funniest part of that joke is he thinks I'm a rookie and I waste it on the chest.  What am I, an open microphone?  Jesus, chest was two years ago.  Pass A.  Oh, shit on the chest, it's so 98.  Oh God, shit on the chest. 
[02:56:00]  You should headline your own club this weekend.  Screw Patrice.  He does quite often.  Yes, he does.  Maybe it'll snow tonight, Patrice, you'll get off the clock.  That is the worst, though, when you headline.  I was in when I, all the time, except for this last time I did okay in Baltimore, but every  other time I've just, I've had 30 people there on a Saturday, and you just look at the staff.  What are you talking about?  Like, when you're in a club, if it's empty, which the Baltimore improv for me has been brutal a couple times.  Well, are you on in Baltimore?  Now we are, it's okay.  Yeah, that's why they don't show up.  If you're not, if you're aware that they're not, don't listen to the rest, who knows you, stupid? 
[02:56:30]  That's what I'm saying.  You're about as unknown as me if it wasn't for Opie and Anthony.  That's not true.  You jackass.  You jackass.  He did Spider-Man.  He was in the movie Spider-Man.  I mean, I couldn't be as unknown as you.  He's six foot eight and invisible.  No one knows me.  How did this happen?  Actually, I think no one knows me unless I did the Opie and Anthony.  I'm unknown.  In the 80s, I'd be somebody.  It's amazing how...  Why do you keep saying in the 80s? 
[02:57:00]  Why do you keep going back to the 80s?  Because...  What do you do in the 80s?  Hacks in the 80s, I'm saying...  Are you a hack?  The things that...  Wait, this is people in the business talking.  I've done four movies.  I've been on Conan O'Brien about six times.  You sound like a whiny bitch right now.  You sound terrible.  What?  Just start saying funny shit.  Maybe people will come see you.  I'm trying to sell tickets to your stupid hat club, Vinny.  Have you done six Conans?  You're selling your bacon.  Who's booking that?  Who's booking Conans? 
[02:57:30]  That's the awful comedian interruption.  Who's behind you?  Damn it.  I'm not whining.  I'm just saying.  Now, people know you're selling tickets.  I'm really busting your balls.  It's going to be big.  I know what your stupid hair do.  Just shut up.  Was that doctor a bob or two at the same time?  Root canal and trim, you jackass.  There's nothing wrong with Vinny's haircut.  If you're on a stage singing, putting on the ribs, there's nothing wrong with that.  You really do have a head head.  I can't believe I'm watching a fucking dying black man give him dental advice and you give 
[02:58:00]  me hair advice.  What is upside down about this fucking world?  You have no head to speak of.  God almighty.  Before you insult me, can you just pick up a receiver?  It makes no sense unless you pretend you're a cop.  Hey, Norton, Leobald, here's two free tickets.  Y'all ready to laugh?  7-3-2-5-4-5-4-2-4-2 for tickets. 
[02:58:30]  Thank you, Jim.  Ha ha.  Stress factor.  Yeah, stress factor.  It's going to be good.  It's going to be very good.  We have a very special...  That sounds convincing, Vinny.  No, let me tell you something.  It's actually...  It's a good show.  Big Jay is also very fucking funny.  Yes, Jay is.  He killed last night.  Jay Ogerson is a very funny dude.  As much as I find him annoying offstage with his awful fat face and smoking habits.  Between Jay and Patrice, this is the fattest show I've ever watched.  I'm fucking really...  I'm really scared of the food bill this night. 
[02:59:00]  I can't eat food at your place no more, Vinny.  It's a wrap.  You can.  No.  You even fry your lettuce.  Give me a fried Greek cheese and fried.  Give me a fried Caesar salad.  Vinny dips his Caesar salad in flour.  Ain't right.  Ain't right with the saying about my food.  You're cutting below the belt right there.  Oh, sorry.  Folks, it's the delicious fried Caesar salad. 
[02:59:30]  He takes pride in his food there, Patrice.  Please.  What'd I miss?  We've just been doing this for an hour.  We gave up on the show, I think, at 8.30.  Anthony's a trooper.  Another hour of Betty Davis mouth over here.  Jesus Christ.  I can't feel a thing.  I know I'm just going to wrench down on my tongue and have to go to the emergency room.  Did he give you some pills for today?  No, I've got to go fill a prescription. 
[03:00:00]  Will that stay right for you until the end of the show, at least?  Uh, yeah, so, let's ask Anthony.  That's all they say.  Thanks, old soul.  What was that thing Mary Poppins said?  Yeah.  Supercalifragilisticexicalidocious.  Maybe I should come back and sit in that chair.  Because you really can't contribute to it right now.  I really can't do shit.  Oh, man.  Where's Bonnie?  Where's Bonnie?  That's Bonnie.  My fiance.  My lover.  That fucking worm Voss.  We were doing Albany together and that phone rang 30 times and that cocksucker picked it 
[03:00:30]  up every time.  He's, he's, he has changed, Voss has changed, man.  We've seen it, we've seen it.  But he changed, you know what?  He changed her.  You know her?  Yeah.  She, he's changed her too, man.  Really?  She's not, it's not just like Voss is in love.  They're both like, in this weird love.  And I think because they're both degenerates and this is their first time that they've  been loving to another human being and they just, they're losing their lives.  They're really running with him.  I can't wait till she dumps him.  I can't wait till she's got to wait for some more change.  You've got to wait for Voss to make her funny. 
[03:01:00]  You would be heartbroken.  What I can't wait is till they fire him from the show they have together and keep her.  Oh, yeah.  And she'll have to go, look, I love you, but I have to think of myself too.  It's for us.  I'll do it for us.  I tell you, I gave, I thought it's lasting a long time so far.  I thought it'd be over by, but you know.  No.  I'll be there to pick him up.  Don't worry, Vossy.  All his friends.  I don't know Bonnie that well, but Voss is in love.  He really is in love.  Voss is really in love.  It makes me sick.  Oh, it's awful.  But he's 57.  He's got his credit just cleared up. 
[03:01:30]  He bought his first house connected to another house.  He bought his first town, I own my townhouse apartment.  Siamese home, fucking zilch.  Get out of here.  Get someone a yard, you're 80.  Jesus Christ with your rented home.  This guy's his own, you idiot.  Oh, there's wheels on it, if I want to move it.  Anybody want to buy my Rolex?  Oh, you jerk off. 
[03:02:00]  Oh, he's all happy he just got credit at 57.  Just got it.  First love and first go.  Voss is out of high school.  He's 42 years removed from everything.  He's the only guy that had his children co-sign for his townhouse.  Oh, date of birth of co-signee, 86.  One, four, 86. 
[03:02:30]  I'm going to ask Bonnie to wear my pin.  Will you marry me?  And he bought her a second-hand wedding ring.  Not a good deal.  He makes me sick.  Did you hear his awful proposal story?  It was in a Best Western, like near Newark Airport.  They flew it.  Oh, it's fucking...  Joel Steinberg was more romantic,  when he was fucking chaining Little Lisa to the thing  and punching her head on the throat.  Did you hear what he said to her?  Did you hear what he handed her to the box and said...  He turned around and walked away and said, 
[03:03:00]  you can say no if you want to.  How fucking sad.  How fucking unbelievably sad.  What a low self-esteem.  You think he was the same size kneeling down  asking to marry his wife saying no?  Little fingers putting the ring on him.  Oh, the awful hands.  She probably jumped twice before she said no.  All right, I do.  Just don't touch me no more.  All right, all right.  Yes.  He has awful acclimation hands.  They don't bend.  Take doll fingers.  Just leave the ring on the pillow. 
[03:03:30]  I'll grab it.  I can't wait until Bonnie leaves him.  I just can't wait.  All curled up in the shower.  I'm washing off.  Trying to hold his face with his little Davy and Goliath fingers.  Back to the pipe.  Back to gambling.  Back to booze.  I can't not wait until Valsh is back.  Put him right over the top.  Sell his house for...  Sell his house for a hit.  Sell that connected to another house.  Mansion.  Hey, Patrice, I think I found out why people don't like you. 
[03:04:00]  You're not nice.  You're not a fucking nice guy.  You don't have a nice thing going on.  One of my favorite tough crowd moments was awful Patrice.  Jeff Garland was on the show.  Oh.  And Jeff said some joke that just bombed.  And Patrice was like, you're on a fucking improv show and that's the funniest thing you can say.  And Jeff just broke out and goes, what are you going to fucking bust my balls?  Oh, I hate that Fred Flintstone head.  He just really bugs me.  Every time I see his smarmy giant head. 
[03:04:30]  Makes me want to try to get candy out of it.  That fat...  Hit it with a broomstick.  You're going to curb your enthusiasm, really?  Oh.  That makes me laugh about as much as a lamp.  I've never seen it.  I've never seen the show.  By mistake, I think.  Is it overrated?  Nothing was working except for HBO.  Is it overrated?  Oh, whatever, man.  You know, you can't even talk about certain things in your career.  People are like, oh, it's a Caribbean.  Whatever.  That moon head.  I like to shove his head right in the toilet like Mickey Rourke. 
[03:05:00]  Did you get to the...  I can't even say it.  Oh, the trainable?  No.  Trainable.  Well, we can do that.  We have to end the week by getting rid of this.  The trainable audio.  And don't play the ones we've heard.  No, it hurts.  We've got four that we haven't played yet.  But first, I mean, Patrice O'Neal is going to be playing Vinny's Club this weekend.  Stress factor.  What's the number again there, Jimmy?  And I like the way Vinny did this because what happens is you incorporate part of the  mood into the phone number, which I thought was just a super idea. 
[03:05:30]  It's 732-545.  Ha ha.  That's like a hospital going, call us at 1743.  Ow.  Ow.  1-800.  And leave Walsh the last tumor for saving you. 
[03:06:00]  It's 545-4242, but that comes in a ha-ha.  That is absolutely fantastic.  What a coincidence.  Yeah.  I paid extra for that.  Yeah, and he fought hard for that.  We said, well, we got giggle, giggle.  Do you want that one?  No.  No, it's got to be ha-ha.  Oh, you're fucking stupid.  I've been way too many numbers.  And when Keith Robinson works, he said, you have to change the 545-ZZZZ. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, man.  That's another black guy.  Two and a half.  Two and a half.  Two and a half black guys.  Oh, they're doing...  Oh, this...  I love this.  I'm in the Stress Factory.  I stopped by this and I'm pissing.  And I look on the wall and they have advertisers for shows coming up.  And Vinny and Keith Robinson are doing a Father's Day show.  What's it called?  Father's Day in black and white.  Father's Day in black and white, yeah.  Like one black guy, one white guy.  You know, both dads.  Probably different points of view.  And fucking Keith's credits.  It says, this fucking finished idiot. 
[03:07:00]  Hammer it, you fucking moron.  Hammer it.  Next Thursday.  Keith...  I've already sold more seats than you, you cocksucker.  It's a great...  I have a fucking 150 on the book for Thursday.  That's a great show.  Thank you.  But Keith's credits on that fucking wall.  I wanted to throw that paper into the urinal.  He said he was on Star Search a couple of years ago.  A couple of years ago?  Did he really say that?  Yes.  Like Keith is this up-and-comer.  Keith is 46 years old.  It's the new one on PAX.  That's what he's talking about.  We still have his head shots. 
[03:07:30]  It says, punch him on it.  Fucking Keith's first sets now are on the Game Show Network.  He is fucking an old Finnish man.  He really is an old man now.  That credit list is awful.  You look at all these impressive credits and then you realize, oh, those are the people  he's open for.  I told you, every time he's on stage, after he finishes a joke, he reintroduces himself.  He's a big emcee.  You do.  That's brutal.  That's brutal. 
[03:08:00]  That's brutal.  Hey.  Anthony, are you all right over there?  Oh, yeah.  Look at his teeth just wiggling his tongue around him.  It's like stroke face.  And the worst part is, I know it's going to wear off.  And the pain will come back.  How long did he say it would stay?  Two hours.  At least until you get to the other place, right?  You go to the other dentist, right?  Yeah, but that wears off, too.  I got it.  Yeah, but when there's no nerve, man.  If they get the nerve out, you can't feel anything.  It's not going to exist. 
[03:08:30]  The pain is going to be gone.  I think the penicillin's got to kick in.  You get pain medication, though, from the other place.  They'll prescribe something.  They'll get you on Percocet.  You'll be fine, man.  You'll be fine, man.  Tell him to take that nerve out, Andy.  Get it out.  And then you'll be fine.  Out.  Let's go to Mark.  Mark, what's up, buddy?  Not much.  I'm wondering if Jimmy Norton, when you call a hoker, do you call 1-800-HO-HO?  I wouldn't mind...  I wouldn't mind this so much if you didn't call her a hoker, you fucking idiot.  A hoker.  A hoker. 
[03:09:00]  Are you a hoker?  I just thought I was doing great.  Oh, that poor guy was waiting for hours.  Oh, he was.  I'm going to crack them all up.  They're going to love this.  Hey, we got to do a live read for Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  Patrice, you do it.  Hey.  Hold on.  I can't read right away.  Why not?  I have to think first and then read.  Like the song says, you'll love Paisano.  A great restaurant, great in the heart of Little Italy. 
[03:09:30]  Try Paisano of Mulberry Street.  Huge portions.  Joey feeds us all the time.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Remember we went?  You went?  Well, it was delicious.  All right, good.  The classic...  That's great moulignon there.  Delicious, big moulignon.  Fried moon crickets.  Paisano is the classic candlelit restaurant, perfect for late night date or romantic meals.  Every single pasta on the menu is now under $10. 
[03:10:00]  At Paisano, mention XM Radio for a free glass of wine.  Authentic Italian cuisine made from the original Italian recipes and fun and romance of Italy in a friendly restaurant.  That's Paisano, open weekends until 2 a.m.  Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy, between Grant and Hester.  Plenty of niggas there.  Enjoy Paisanos.  Only Patrice can make a Paisano answer.  Like a Popeye's answer.  Believe me, the phone call's going to come. 
[03:10:30]  Great show.  Don't ever let him read that again.  Plenty of them there.  A lot of people are not happy.  Give out the phone number for Paisano.  People want to make reservations.  Call them.  Apologize, Paisanos.  Yeah.  Call 212-965-1188.  That's 965-HA-HA.  That's 212-965-1188 for a delicious meal at Paisano.  And remember, mention XM Radio for a free glass of wine.  That's right.  And that is, they have to buy a meal or you just come in, say XM, and get a free wine and you can leave. 
[03:11:00]  You can leave.  I guess that's...  Good luck leaving, though.  Good luck.  Good luck leaving.  I might have a little problem at the door, but I guess if you want to, you could try leaving.  We're going to take a break and then we're going to take a leak.  And yeah, we're going to take leaks.  And then we will end the show, end the week, with this trainable audio.  The last four tracks, finally, Anthony.  A lot of people are requesting the Terry Schiavo thing.  The Zeppelin?  The Zeppelin thing.  That's my favorite thing all week.  Really?  Really funny.  It's really funny. 
[03:11:30]  It's self-explanatory, so we can just play it and take this break.  Who has it?  Does Derek have it?  He's working.  I'll look at him.  Have one?  He's like, no, I don't.  Not yet.  I will in a second.  Now he's got a thumbs up.  Hit it.  You are so fucking hot. 
[03:12:00]  I'm so fucking into you.  But that's you so jealous.  Oh, I can't be proceeding.  It's like a good chance.  Make it crazy.  Fucking crazy. 
[03:12:30]  Stop.  Stop.  I'm so fucking hot. 
[03:13:00]  Look at me, I'll say yes.  Kyle, I'm up there.  Read off to your face.  Oh, God.  I just fucking have some sex here.  Come on.  Drugs.  Tonight you better stop.  Reveal all your ruins.  Be some trust. 
[03:13:30]  Give me the day.  Just smile and all your looies.  7.09.  10.  7.48.  10.  7.51.  10.  8.64.  9.04.  You have no more messages. 
[03:14:00]  Hey, what's that?  You've never seen it before?  Looks like a rock.  New from Sedentary Toys and the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, it's so shiny.  It's got corners.  It's the cool new toy that has everyone jumping for joy.  O&A Party Rock.  It's not just any rock.  It's the O&A Party Rock.  The O&A Party Rock is incredibly versatile.  You can chuck it.  You can fuck it.  You can drop it in a bucket.  You can race it.  You can chase it.  You can yell right in its face.  It's the bestest friend you'll ever have. 
[03:14:30]  O&A Party Rock.  Why is it wearing a party hat?  Every Party Rock comes dressed in a colorful party hat and party blower,  making it the centerpiece of any party.  Now with shiny red dancing shoes.  Not only that, the O&A Party Rock is, is, is, is, is a fucking rock, you dildo.  Opie and Anthony.  XM 202.  XM 202.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah!  Oh, that's so crazy.  That's so crazy. 
[03:15:00]  Oh, that's so bad, man.  Just continuing through the break, yeah.  It's the Opie and Anthony program.  In studio, Patrice O'Neal playing Vinny's Club,  The Stress Factory, New Brunswick, this weekend.  Wonderful club, by the way.  Yes.  Oh, look at you.  Hey, yeah.  And the phone number is something.  I don't know.  I love this.  Of course, he's paid.  He's compensated for his work.  Yes.  Try that again.  He is compensated for his work.  I mean, what are we here, communists? 
[03:15:30]  Want to get into the trainable audio?  The last four tracks, finally.  It only took all week to get to this.  Considering I sound like one today.  Sure.  Yes.  People are suggesting that, Anthony.  Basically, these are retards that are...  Hey!  Come on.  There's no way to talk.  Mentally challenged.  What happened?  There's just no way to talk.  What happened?  They teach a family about love and tolerance.  Well, they're retards that can be trained.  Mentally challenged.  So they came up with this term, uh, trainables. 
[03:16:00]  They teach you how to love something and cleverly position it behind furniture for family pictures.  Oh, God.  What?  Why do you know so many bad things about...  You don't do any bad words, Norm.  Why are there two ears sticking out behind that couch?  There he is.  Who's behind that plan?  Pete Rose?  Oh, my God.  Oh, man. 
[03:16:30]  Oh, man.  All for retarded haircut poking over the rhododendron.  Oh.  Well, these were instructional videos that were out in the early 60s, Anthony.  And, you know, they have problems just like you and I.  And they need someone to, uh, instruct them.  Yeah.  So, you know, retards have to date, right?  Hey.  Mentally.  Challenge.  Yes. 
[03:17:00]  It's not retards anymore.  Right.  Like, they're in 1955, Opie.  Yeah.  They don't even have that word.  Come on.  Yeah.  So we have audio.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Bang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang.  Yeah, look at the retards.  Bang-a-dang-a-dang.  Hey, retards.  What song do you want to hear on this jukebox, retard?  Hey.  Look at the retards with the colored guy.  Come here.  Look at the little cooler than that, retard.  Roll your cigarettes up in your sleeve, you damn retard.  Back in those days, if you set a retard on fire, it was a misdemeanor. 
[03:17:30]  Now, retard, go slap his wrist.  Not, not nice.  You go to jail.  Okay, I'm going now, retard.  Look at that tongue.  It looks like Thunderbird Lane.  Oh, man.  That's not right.  That's not right. 
[03:18:00]  Can we go to the tape?  Oh, boy.  That's what he's doing.  He's putting the penis into the hole between your legs.  The girls are not confused by the introduction of different positions for moralization.  If the retardate can understand sexual intercourse,  future sessions could include related responsibilities,  such as appropriate times and places,  and the purpose of birth control.  Any and anywhere. 
[03:18:30]  The purpose of birth control?  That's a mirror.  That's how you teach what the purpose of birth control would be.  Look, genetic mess.  That's a training tape you should use right there.  The proper place to have sex and when and how.  Birth control.  You see a hole, you pull your pants down.  Because you're already walking around humping.  Humping for no reason.  That ain't right.  That just ain't right.  Retard. 
[03:19:00]  He said the retard.  Retardate.  He didn't need to retardate?  Retardate?  He's French.  It just kind of jumps into the middle of the clip here.  Let's listen again.  That's what he's doing.  He's putting the penis into the hole between your legs.  The girls are not confused by the introduction of different positions for moralizations.  If the retardate can understand sexual endorsement,  it could include related responsibilities,  such as appropriate times and places, 
[03:19:30]  and the purpose of birth control.  Genetic disaster.  Well, the next one's really good.  Ricky gets caught J-O-ing.  Who?  Ricky.  Ricky.  Our intern.  Ricky, yeah.  Oh, the tape.  I figured you would do it in the wrong place.  What is this now?  What are you pointing at?  The Ricky drop.  Oh, no.  All right.  Do you have the Ricky interview?  Yeah.  Ricky the intern?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, very good.  Is it good?  Yeah, it fits right in. 
[03:20:00]  Eric likes nodding on the radio.  Yes.  Don't be shy.  All right, here's a retard named Ricky getting caught J-O-ing.  Oh, excuse me, Ricky.  Ricky, Ricky, I did see what you were doing.  It felt good, didn't it?  Oh, hi, Stevie.  All right, Stevie.  And in the background of your security aisle five.  Right idea, wrong place, dumbo head.  Man, you caught me, baby.  Now what? 
[03:20:30]  You know it's a big retard cock.  Oh, man.  You know those fat retard dicks?  And he's working with two hands.  His thumbs aren't even touching.  It disturbs me that you know what a retard cock looks like.  It disturbs me for many reasons.  Oh, they're just big, fat ones.  They're long, fat, awful.  How the fuck do you know that?  Because I went to high school.  Good Lord always takes away something.  When he takes away something, he gives a little something extra.  Their legs are always fat.  Their heads are always big, right?  The Down syndrome.  Their tongues are fat.  Well, why shouldn't the cock be big and delicious as well? 
[03:21:00]  Just like the tongue.  All uncut.  It looks like one of the Acela trains.  I'm really going out of a limb trying to say Acela.  Yeah, exactly.  What an ass.  Choo-choo is easier.  Oh, giant helmet with like Vinny's head.  Oh, come on.  Hey, leave this boy's life haircut alone.  Vinny knows a thing or two about a thing or two.  La-da-dee.  La-da-da.  La-da-da.  La-la-la-la.  Life goes on. 
[03:21:30]  There you go, corky head asshole.  Oh, my God.  Yay, you caught me J-O, huh, baby?  I saw what you did.  Yeah, let's continue listening.  Oh, excuse me, Ricky.  Ricky, I did see what you were doing.  It felt good, didn't it?  It's all right.  We all have feelings like this sometimes.  I'm just glad you're doing this in the privacy of your own room. 
[03:22:00]  When you're a little bit older, we'll have to talk more about these feelings and what causes them and how we can control these feelings.  I'm sorry I intruded on your privacy.  I'll be sure to knock next time, okay?  Next thing you hear is him trying to stroke her hair and then he smothers her in a barn.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Don't leave.  Don't leave.  Where are you going?  I'm supposed to rush.  And the poor retard is just trying to jerk off in his room and this bitch marches right in. 
[03:22:30]  She's the problem.  I'm knocking, bitch.  Sorry I didn't knock.  I just walked in because you're stupid.  You're normally just eating crayons.  Nice retarded load right on her back.  Good for her.  Get out and take this with your swish.  And you know he wasn't even doing it right.  He was probably going like left, right, left, right, left, right.  Punching it.  Punching it.  I'm coming. 
[03:23:00]  One fat kick to the groin.  He keeps that low chromosome batch all over him.  Now with less chromosomes.  And when he comes, he sounds like regular.  He goes, I'm coming.  Oh, that was fantastic.  Women, yeah, because there's no chromosome so it doesn't put calories on.  For those of you on a chromosome fruit diet, there's quirky batch.  I'm coming. 
[03:23:30]  Beautiful.  Thank you very much.  That really made me feel much better.  Well, we take it to the next level.  The next one is a trainable J-O-ing in art class.  In art class.  All right.  True with it.  How are you doing, Sandy?  Okay.  Sandy?  What are you doing?  Okay.  You stop and finish your picture, okay?  All right?  Finish your snowman.  If a trainable does not respond to verbal admonition for masturbating in front of others, 
[03:24:00]  she is removed from the group.  This is repeated as many times as necessary until she realizes this is not acceptable social behavior.  If they cannot be made to understand through this method, they may need special help.  Anyone who is pro-life should look at footage of a retard masturbating in front of a half-finished snowman picture.  Oh, you know what?  I thought when she said finish your snowman, she was meaning to finish doing what you was doing. 
[03:24:30]  Oh, this is an art class.  Drawing a snowman, you simple thing.  I thought it was she was calling that finishing snowman.  How easily distracted are you when somewhere between the little hat and the corncob pipe you've got to rub your clit?  Look at the tip on that snowman.  Oh, sweetie, finish this fishy little snowman. 
[03:25:00]  Finish your square snowman, stupid.  Like a snow house.  Finish your snow queue.  And you know she didn't know it was a snowman until Dumbbell said it was?  Oh, look, three straight lines.  It's a snowman.  Good job.  It's a snowman.  It's a snowman.  And you know she had paint all over her fingers.  The snatch would look like Tammy Faye Baker.  It's a no man.  No.  It's all the wrong color, brown snowman.  You dummy. 
[03:25:30]  Slap the shit out of you, stupid idiot.  It's a no man.  No.  No.  It's snowy.  Look at Vinny.  Vinny, what's wrong?  You got some retarded candy now?  I can't.  No.  This is, uh, it's very funny.  Uh-oh.  No, no, I don't give a shit.  You know what I mean?  Look on, I have no compassion.  Vinny has retarded evenings.  He has retarded, like, he sells out retarded shows, especially Wednesday night, uh, train-y 
[03:26:00]  show or whatever.  Trainable shows.  It's Vinny and Keith Robertson doing trainable shows.  Sit down.  Some trainables may masturbate in front of the comedian.  Stop fucking the chicken wings, sweetie.  You don't have a pot in there.  This trainable has a hot wing in her ass.  Oh, sweetie.  Doesn't the sauce burn?  No!  And the prank phone calls.  He calls the trainable's parents.  Your child got an A today. 
[03:26:30]  uh... uh... really now with the comedy club are eating a napkin  uh...  uh...  wasn't yet ever  here's a napkin  uh...  with the videos have a problem  uh... elected tell the truth about it out of that  i can't necessarily try to trainable  you don't have a trainable haircut 
[03:27:00]  it's something maybe it's not a bad night  i have a train of answering my phone to the club i'm just saying  that uh... you know it's funny that maybe something about that pop out  why is there somebody that you know that's a yes okay  uh... oh boy  so that's it but it doesn't that way i knew that from the beginning so they  start oh yeah i saw it in his eyes  let me explain  you're being a good more any parity on the  films of themselves  we're goofing on the people that put together the archaic 
[03:27:30]  uh...  films on training  uh... mentally challenged people  have you heard the things i've said  yeah i don't know that you know  it's not that i'm carrying a poster in front of the station you know don't listen or  anything but fucking norton is definitely not parodying anything  i'm just a scumbag  norton's trying to put answers in the seats  preferably not trainables  i felt that from the beginning  i don't know yes carter i don't mean he's trying to like be of that's for the  time you know it's not a big group of the trainable shirt 
[03:28:00]  but  uh...  unit don't travel face get over any  i see you laughing at diabetics  that's a good point that's all you  leave soon to have sleet stack feet alone  oh my god  oh my goodness poor man what are you gonna do many man  i'm just listening it's very funny and i don't expect a man like you to understand because you don't have a decency chromosome 
[03:28:30]  yes i do man  no you have a number of people who have retired kids and all things they people everybody get laughed at  yeah i don't give a shit i can't necessarily chime in  some retarded kid jerking off in class is funny on any planet  and i don't know if you have any level anywhere anytime  also don't forget hot  i mean i'm sorry but you know she's not modest  and and and you know you'll love that that uncontrolled retarded piss where you just they just piss when they don't even know it  and you know it's there to catch up 
[03:29:00]  oh he pisses  he's in the classroom  he's in the classroom  on one of those mechanic crawlers  he used to get under the cars with just sliding from seat to seat  getting pissed off  oh there goes janey  oh look at me  oh poor vennie  i'm not not laughing  i almost feel like we shouldn't play the uh...  the next one  please  not only do i feel we should play the last one i should we should replay the first three 
[03:29:30]  we have one more left  you know you man no no no no no  this is finally it  the last one  about improper touching  can you teach values  or sexual morality  to a trainable  if you don't teach them  there's always the chance that they'll get in trouble  and they can be arrested  teachers should not thrust their own moral values on their students  there are too many conflicting moral systems today 
[03:30:00]  this is the responsibility of the family if available  however  it is the teachers duty  to enlighten their students on the commonly accepted standards of sexual behavior  no one should use the body of an unwilling partner for their own pleasure  unprotected and unplanned sexual intercourse is wrong  and no one need allow anyone to touch their bodies  if they do not want them to 
[03:30:30]  we may not always succeed in reaching the trainables  we must  always try  that one's boring  yeah  patrice would never get laid if he followed those rules  but  oh man  oh wow  i was gonna say they're teaching them not to commit rape  that's like  that's useful  yeah  very useful patrice  that's right  that's very useful  they probably use more practical language  keep those sticky hands  off the neck  of the girl in the flower dress

[03:39:00]  she received a text message on her cell phone last week from her former boyfriend  it read  have a miscarriage  less than a week later lucas county sheriff's detective said the former boyfriend made it happen  her  this guy's accused of forcing his way into uh... his girlfriend's apartment on monday  punching her several times!  in his stomach  and sexually assaulting her  haha  Looking for Vinny 
[03:39:30]  I don't know  Vinny's a family man dude  yeah  well all right well let me rephrase that  he was accused of uh... breaking in and uh... taking charge  charge. He was accused of breaking in and getting results. Solving a problem. As a result  of the attack, detective said the woman suffered a miscarriage of her 10-week-old fetus. Authorities  arrested him. He's 6'4", 290 pounds, and he's in jail, and he is in a lot of trouble. Man,  what a set. To text first, have a miscarriage. Because you know, at one point he fucked it 
[03:40:00]  up. He probably put, I have, and he's going to go, oh shit, that's an H, not an I. Oh  man. Have a miscarriage. She didn't. He gave her a couple of days, and then made things  happen. I like that. Thought I told you to have a miscarriage. Go. Don't listen. He  walked in, looked at the linoleum. What is not on this floor? I know. I want to see 
[03:40:30]  a stewed tomato in the toilet by noon, or be paying you a little visit. Look at Norton.  Norton is the happiest I've ever seen him. Oh man. Norton couldn't be happier. Look at  him. Look at him. Look at him. Oh. Fucking, you turned a stewed tomato. You turned bright red,  you turned a stewed tomato. Oh man. That was awful. That is exactly. That was horrible. Oh 
[03:41:00]  no. Damn. A little tear and a flush. Come on, you can't be that connected to it, baby. It's  ten weeks. Really. Get over it. I mean, those are the little. Jesus. It's not like you hear  mama before. It just sucks down the pipe. Oh my God. The last little sight you see of it. 
[03:41:30]  I can't. You fucking can't. I can't. You fucking can't. I can't. Why? Why? Why? The show  is going so nice. We were doing such a good time. Stewed tomato. Patrice O'Neal, tonight  and tomorrow, Stress Factory, 732-545-4242. With a special guest this evening. With Big Jay 
[03:42:00]  Oakerson. It's a great show, man. You guys are idiots if you don't know. And a very special  guest tonight. A very special guest. Yes. We're not allowed to mention the special guest tonight.  I'm going to laugh for hours at that stewed tomato. God, that was perfect. Because a  stewed tomato sounds like it would have a fat kerplunk. Have a little glass radius when  it hits. As you look like stewed cauliflower. You look like something that can flush down  the toilet. Vinny, anything? I just think that that was brutal. But yeah, funny. Get 
[03:42:30]  the video camera before you flush. That's it. Oh, he's all hurt. No, no, no. Listen.  I'm not hurt at all. That's fucking funny. That's just back of the bus shit. I can't do  that. Why? All right. I get it. All right. Son of a bitch. What? Back of the bus. We had  to curse him out about being funny. Because he likes to hang out with these unfunny guys.  I don't know. But you see what happens. You see what happens? You hang out with unfunny guys 
[03:43:00]  and you get a conscience. Leave him alone. Stupid. Stop trying to cut your hair like  you're smart.  Go ahead, Norton. Say it. I don't like it. You can't even get banged with that thing.  It's like they're trying to be banged. I can't fucking believe you. I know a thing or two  about a thing or two. I hear you do quite the impression of me, Vinny. You can call me what  you want, but don't call me late for dinner. Five, four, five. Thank you. Get better, 
[03:43:30]  Mr. Anthony. Everybody go home. </pre>
