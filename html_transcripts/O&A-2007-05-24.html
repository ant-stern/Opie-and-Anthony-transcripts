<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with the hosts railing against the perceived pressure for radio to always be "nice," immediately transitioning into a lengthy discussion about strip clubs.  They detailed ludicrously high bills, alleged club scams, and offered colorful commentary on lap dances, comparing them to animal mating rituals. A caller recounted spending $1000 on lap dances in Los Angeles.  The hosts also discussed strippers’ commutes, often using Penn Station and airports while concealing their profession from their families.  This transitioned into “Phone Call Thursday,” with several callers sharing their own strip club anecdotes, focusing on pricing and alcohol policies.  The American Idol finale was briefly discussed, with the hosts expressing disinterest and making observations about the winner, Jordan Sparks.

A significant portion of the show focused on a video segment about a college student who worked at a coffee shop and a strip club, writing a thesis (using the term "ethnography") about her experiences.  The hosts mocked the student's apparent reasoning and her thesis, focusing on their lack of understanding of "ethnography," and  offered cynical commentary on both strippers and their clientele.  The show then briefly touched upon the Rosie O'Donnell and Elisabeth Hasselbeck feud on *The View*.

The Rosie/Elisabeth argument from *The View* became a major segment.  Opie and Anthony played clips, offering commentary laced with jokes targeting Rosie's appearance and sexuality, and Elizabeth's perceived intelligence.  The debate expanded to include the Iraq War and Rosie’s 9/11 conspiracy theories, both of which the hosts mocked. A caller unexpectedly called in about her period, prompting unsolicited advice from the hosts.  They then discussed the iGasm sex toy, likening its marketing to iPod ads and discussing how technology is adapted for sexual use.  The segment concluded with an "Uncomfortably Close Interview" featuring intern Jared and "Stalker Patty," resulting in much awkwardness and discomfort. Sherry Shepard's presence on *The View* during the confrontation was also mentioned.

The “Uncomfortably Close Interview” continued into the next segment, this time focusing on Patty’s past, including living under the stairs of WNEW with a rabbit and previous show stunts (shaving her head and rolling in mousetraps).  The hosts encouraged increasingly intimate physical contact, culminating in a forced "grandma kiss."  The second half of this segment featured Dr. Ian Smith and Pat from Menachie.  Dr. Smith discussed his *Celebrity Fit Club* experience, particularly a near-physical altercation between Dustin Diamond and Harvey.  Dr. Smith then diagnosed Pat, who had gained significant weight, as diabetic based on his feet, recommending the "Fat Smash" diet and Opie offered to pay for Pat's gym membership.  The segment concluded with details about an Opie & Anthony listener contest offering a national magazine feature for successful weight loss using the "Fat Smash" diet and a cryptic mention of a mysterious meeting the hosts were about to attend.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Thank you. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw! 
[00:04:00]  Yeah!  Yeah!  Opie and Anthony.  What are you doing in death?  I've been hanging a lot with JFK.  He's the life of the party, let me tell you.  Why would he be the life of the party?  At the party, he's the one that goes around with the Doritos and he fills his head with salsa. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, my.  It's time for people, it's time for people, it's time for people to understand these are words, if you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I like that intro.  That's fun.  Bravo, Steve.  Bravo.  Bravo, Steve.  Bravo.  It's over, Johnny.  It's over, Johnny. 
[00:05:00]  It's over, Johnny.  Don't you do it!  Don't you!  I got nowhere else to go!  I got nowhere else to go!  You're going to be okay!  Quit taking the nuts in! 
[00:05:30]  That's it, man.  Game over, man.  Game over!  Oh, Lord, this ain't happening, man.  This can't be happening, man.  This can't be happening.  Also want to thank Derek for the intro.  I got the email, too.  Don't worry, Steve. 
[00:06:00]  No, Steve and Derek worked real hard on the intro, the brand new intro, for the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus.  Is here.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  Good morning.  Good morning!  Hi, I...  Hi, I...  Hey, uh... 
[00:06:30]  Little story popped down in front of me.  Yes.  And it got me to thinking.  I want to wake up.  Oh, we're waking people.  You know we wake up people from time to time, right?  Every so often.  We have woken the amputees in the past.  Mm-hmm.  We have woken the horny housewives, the MILFs.  Who else?  Step-dads.  Step-dads with hot step-daughters.  Yeah.  That one was a little twisted.  Uh...  I don't know.  I forgot the other ones.  Offhand. 
[00:07:00]  I want to wake up the strippers that are working their way through college.  Good luck.  They aren't waking up.  Oh, yeah.  Not this early.  Maybe they're driving home.  They're just getting home.  Maybe they're driving home.  All coked out.  Ugh.  I guess...  In desperate need of a shower.  Maybe that's what we should do.  We should say hi to the people that are actually going to bed now.  That are still, like, up, yeah.  Going, oh, why am I up? 
[00:07:30]  Why did I drink so much?  Why did I go out?  Stupid people at work said,  Let's go to happy hour.  Why didn't I stay in school?  I don't know where my wallet and keys are.  How am I going to explain this to my wife?  I rang up $40,000 on my Amex at the strip club.  I'll just say I was ripped off.  I love those stories.  Oh, those stories are great.  The second they come out, you just believe the strip club. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  It's like, this guy was ordering champagne.  He had three, four girls at a clip coming over.  What was the great one where it was like $200,000?  At scores.  Oh.  At scores.  It was ridiculous.  And that guy, he had a pretty good case because they try...  The lawyer for the guy said,  Look, man, he would have had a lap dance every five seconds for this to be true.  Yeah.  He would have had an order of bottled champagne every, like, 15 minutes.  And then when, you know, when they itemized his bill, it looked pretty ridiculous. 
[00:08:30]  I still believe the strip club, though.  Do you really?  Because you know the guy is just like, Ah, the life of the party.  He probably has, like, five girls over there.  Yeah.  With him.  Five girls at a clip.  All his friends.  Buying everybody drinks.  Trying to make everyone his pal at the strip club.  And then you get your bill and go, What?  This can't be possible.  This is hundreds of thousands of dollars in something I have nothing to show for.  Well, I think a lot of these strip clubs realize that they could kind of, you know... 
[00:09:00]  Fudge it a little bit.  Fudge it a little bit, knowing you're not going to, like, open up your bill in front of your wife  and start going over the charges on your Amex.  You just want that paid immediately.  Preferably online.  Yeah, online.  Don't look at my statement, dear.  Don't even bother mailing statements to my house anymore.  Yeah, please don't.  You're not going to tell your wife, Honey, I had two Diet Cokes before that next face  dance.  This is a lie. 
[00:09:30]  How many guys call their bank and just go, Don't send statements to my house anymore?  Is there a way I could just come by and pay you in cash with no paper trail at all on  this one?  Who's leaving their Amex as a, you know, just run a tab and put the dancers and everything  on it?  Yeah.  Like, I might be able to understand.  I get a little nervous when I leave my Amex at a bar and go, you know, just run a tab. 
[00:10:00]  Because a lot of times I'll forget and leave and forget about my Amex and come back the  next day.  And it's just, it's got friction burns where people have been swiping it all night.  It's actually been burnt.  Are you talking about FH Riley's this past Saturday night?  Don't ever leave your Amex at the bar there.  My God.  They'll get you.  Oh man, the listeners will get you.  There's a lot of hate in their souls.  When Opie makes an announcement that everyone drinks for free for an hour, it's based on 
[00:10:30]  hate in some of these people.  Who like to drink?  I saw a guy like walk away from the bar with like, like six or seven beers.  He was hugging them.  Oh, thanks.  He couldn't get it.  He got one in his mouth.  Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, I got it.  In moderation, my friends.  You're doing.  I'm doing a good deed.  You don't have to be a glutton about it.  Hey, let's say hi to Frank in Astoria.  Frank, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up?  Listen, I don't know if you guys ever seen this one, but Penn Station around 4.30 to 6 in 
[00:11:00]  the morning, you see all the hookers going back to Long Island.  And the way you can tell who they are, they carry like soft duffel bags, always over their  shoulder.  And you can tell they're strippers or hookers.  And everybody's checking them out.  Everybody's drunk going home.  They got all their stinky clothes in that duffel bag, all their stinky stripper clothes  that smell like perfume and sweat.  You know how I can always tell if I was a hooker if I said hi and she said hi back?  And didn't scream for the police. 
[00:11:30]  So at Penn Station here in New York, you see a lot of strippers going back home to Long  Island?  Absolutely.  You get there between 4.30 to 6 in the morning.  They catch those last trains out or the first one out.  Back home.  You see them there.  They're there every Thursday through Saturday night.  Not their first train of the evening, though.  You know what I mean?  I was just reading a book about Vegas.  And they say that if you take a Sunday flight home, like a Sunday afternoon flight, Sunday 
[00:12:00]  night flight home, you'll see all the strippers and whores going back to their hometowns.  They say the airport is filled with strippers and whores in Vegas on Sunday night.  Where are they going?  I thought, stupid me, that they all just lived in Vegas.  But I guess, you know, it's so lucrative out there that these girls, they actually fly  in on a Thursday, spend the weekend, and they fly home and they go back to living with their  parents or whoever.  And no one knows that they're actually going to Vegas on the weekends and doing what they're 
[00:12:30]  doing.  Have no clue.  I thought you could notice them on the planes because they're kind of sitting on one cheek  as they're flying.  The girl doing a headstand now for her.  No thanks.  I'll just stand the whole flight.  I just assume they all just lived locally.  But I guess this is a real thing, that they all fly in around a Thursday and they go home  on a Sunday night and then go back to another job or something in their hometowns.  Wow.  And most of their family have no clue that they're flying out to Vegas every weekend and doing 
[00:13:00]  a little hooking.  They make excuses like, ah, they got a long distance relationship with a boyfriend or something.  Yeah, sure.  Sure.  And the family believes that.  Well, you do whatever you got to do.  Well, let's go to Alicia on Long Island.  Alicia, what's up?  Hey, good morning, guys.  How are you?  Good.  By the way, this is Phone Call Thursday on the Opian Anthony Show.  Phone Call Thursday?  Lots of phone calls from our listeners today.  What's Phone Call Thursday?  Well, we give the listeners a chance to help the Opian Anthony Show out. 
[00:13:30]  Phone Call Thursday.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No?  No, no, no.  That can only be used for...  So we can't do it in the same style.  Jimmy, why don't you help us out?  How would you say Phone Call Thursday?  How would I say Phone Call Thursday?  Miss, you're interrupting.  I'm trying to accomplish something.  You're interrupting an artist.  Let him speak.  It's Phone Call Thursday.  Oh.  Thursday, right?  Accentuate the F.  If you don't have spittle on both lips, you did it wrong. 
[00:14:00]  By the way, a lot of people get confused, but Thursday is the only day that you can pronounce  Thursday.  Oh, right.  A lot of people do that with every day of the week, but only Thursday.  It's a little known fact.  You could say Thursday.  So it's Thursday, Thursday?  So it's Phone Call Thursday.  Phone Call Thursday.  Phone Call Thursday.  What's up, Alicia?  I hate the day of the week things.  That's why we're doing it.  I mean, no.  We are the most annoying people on radio. 
[00:14:30]  Less, Alicia.  I just imagine people in their cars just annoyed.  Like, why do I even listen to these guys?  People who don't like the show who just, I'll give it one more shot, and they turn back on  for three seconds, and they hear Phone Call Thursday.  And they're like, what is this?  Why am I listening?  By the way, I got to say hi to Con Ed.  Wow, do we have fans in Con Ed.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, we do.  Oh.  They're doing a little project in the neighborhood, and hey, you're the DJ that's in trouble.  Really? 
[00:15:00]  Oops.  No.  Well, they, they, uh, they, uh, they, uh, they were, uh, fans.  Fans of the, uh, Opie and Anthony show.  Very supportive.  What happened to Alicia?  Oh, did she go away?  Uh.  I don't have to talk to her.  She's from Long Island.  All right, let's go to Scott in California.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, man.  How's it going?  Love you.  Love the show.  Thank you, sir.  Uh, yeah.  I was out, uh, this weekend out in LA here with my friends, and we were all getting wasted. 
[00:15:30]  And, uh, and, uh, we decided to go to Spearmint Rhino out here.  Uh-huh.  And my friend decided to take a $1,000 credit card advance, and, uh, so I walked by and  see him with two girls getting a lap dance, and, uh, just blew a $1,000.  Oof.  A grand, huh?  That's unbelievable.  I mean, uh, but a hundred grand is a tough one to blow in a night, but a big businessman showing  off could happen.  I mean.  Definitely.  That's a lot of money.  I don't understand, though.  You go out with your buddies to a strip club or whatever, and you're spending that much 
[00:16:00]  money on just lap dances.  I don't really, I don't really get that.  I don't really get where you're spending, like, thousands of dollars in a strip club.  I've seen people do it.  A lap dance or two, sure, whatever, but.  Yeah, I've seen people do it, though.  They buy their friends' lap dances.  What do they expect you to get?  Every two seconds, there's a lap dance going on.  You like lap dances that much, or is it, or does it get into the frustration zone?  The lap dance is the dumbest thing ever.  It is such a nothing thing. 
[00:16:30]  It's a, it's a, it's not even a tease.  It's just annoying.  I, I can't stand that.  No touching, no this.  If you're going to pay for a lap dance, you should be able to grab some hips.  You know what I mean?  Grab those hips and drag them over onto your lap.  It's a lap dance.  It's not a dangling a few inches above my lap dance.  Don't, uh, uh, uh, rotate your head and slap your hair into my lap dance.  That dumb move. 
[00:17:00]  Awful.  Oh yeah.  I love when you whip my jeans with your hair.  That's the, I'm paying for this.  Do you like the other sexy move they do is when they stand up and they look seductively at you and they spank their own ass.  Like they take the one hand and they spank their own shit.  Yeah.  So naughty.  She had to discipline herself.  Yeah.  They, yeah, they turn around and they turn their back to you and then they, they look over their shoulder all and then maybe put that one finger in their mouth. 
[00:17:30]  And go like, I've been naughty.  And then the hand comes up and goes smack.  Oh, excuse me.  You missed the, the part because they're sizzling hot.  Oh, stop it.  I love.  They're like an inch away from me and then, and they're like, no touching.  No touch.  And some big bruisers over there looking at you, making sure you don't touch.  If you do, you, you get a fist dance.  Imagine doing that, but imagine, imagine doing that in the animal kingdom. 
[00:18:00]  You'd be ripped apart.  Yeah.  Like a, like a female, uh, ah, let's go with a lioness.  Uh-huh.  Teasing a lion inches from his face and then goes.  Don't touch.  Because they don't speak English, but.  You know how that always, you know how that always ends up?  With the lion with his teeth on the back of her neck and, and him taking care of business.  That's how it works.  That's the cut, the malarkey toots of the animal kingdom.  Toots.  The teeth in the back of the neck. 
[00:18:30]  Lions still using toots.  Speaking of lions, they have a, they have a very good technique.  Yeah.  When they're having their sex.  Uh-huh.  What animal has a very good technique when they're having sex?  The lion or any of the cat family is pretty good because they, uh, they dig their claws in to the shoulders.  Yeah.  And then they bite the back of the neck.  Yeah.  And that's how they're holding on.  And that's pretty much, you ain't going nowhere.  What animal has awful technique?  Awful technique?  The horse of German pornography doesn't do too well. 
[00:19:00]  Stands there stupidly.  Bunch of people with bad music in the background abuse them.  That's a question we're going to answer today.  Yeah.  I think the lion has a very good technique.  Good technique.  Very good.  Yes.  I think, uh, to tell you the truth.  Dog?  Dog's awful technique.  A little weird.  Awful technique.  Especially when they slip off, uh, and have to stand there back to back at looking stupid.  You ever see when they, they get, uh, stuck together and they're just tail to tail looking in opposite directions? 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  And the male dog is now, uh, in some kind of pain because it's kind of backwards.  Yeah.  Because they're tail to tail and they're, they're just facing an opposite direction.  One dog's looking one way.  One's looking the other.  The male dog's going, what do you want from me?  I'm in pain.  Cat's just awful.  Yeah.  Oh, just awful.  And the screaming that comes out of the females in the middle of the night.  Row, row, row, row, row, row, row, row, row, row, row, row, all right. 
[00:20:00]  And that's at the point where you got to take your shoe and poke a little to make him go,  Row, row, row, row.  Nothing more fun than a cat in heat to screw around with, with your shoe.  Oh, the male cat though, man.  He's just, he's got to get some.  Oh, going wild.  Is that a cat having sex?  I've heard that noise. 
[00:20:30]  Oh yeah.  That's it.  Oh yeah.  That's the cat in heat.  And then when they start having sex, you just hear like, and, and if you look out in your  yard the next morning, there's fur everywhere.  Like they just tear it up.  Wait, do that screaming.  No, the screaming.  When I hear that, I think one thing.  Size queen.  Size queen of the cat world.  Let's say hi to, uh, Steve in Jersey.  Steve, what's up? 
[00:21:00]  Hello.  Hey there, Steve.  Hey.  You're on the air, Steve.  See, this is why we're, we're not fans of phone call Thursday because some of the fans  are still asleep.  Yeah.  My bad.  Let's go, Steve.  Let's go.  What's up?  I was down in Philly, uh, a couple of weeks ago and at cheerleaders and getting, uh, lap  dances and I was sitting there with my hands to my side cause usually you're not allowed  to touch at all.  Right.  So, uh, she looked at me and she was like, you know, is everything okay?  And I was like, uh, yeah. 
[00:21:30]  So, uh, she goes, well, you're able to touch me.  And I was like, hold on, sir.  She grabs your hands.  You know, I should have gave up on you as soon as I said Steve and you, you weren't ready.  You know, you know, uh, you, you know, you know, you know the words that we're not allowed  to use on them.  He hung up on himself.  From radio.  He committed radio suicide.  That's one of them.  That was one of the second 30s for like, you could never say.  Yeah.  Like it should be known.  Yeah.  And you'll never be able to say that on regular radio.  So, uh, well, Philly has the, the bathing suit clubs. 
[00:22:00]  What?  Yeah.  We, when we go down to Philly for, you know, WISP and stuff, they, uh, especially back in  the day, they would take us to the bathing suit club.  Bathing suits.  I forgot the name of it where the girls all dance in bathing suits.  And they're in bikinis.  Bikinis.  Because there's alcohol.  Is that their alcohol rule?  Yeah.  There's some kind of rule with alcohol within, uh, in the club.  And then touching, I think, I think you could grab their hips if they're not naked. 
[00:22:30]  I don't know what the ruling is.  There's so many dumb rules to that.  You know, people that go to strip clubs aren't thrown through the door against their will.  And the girls that are dancing, um, are in there because, uh, that's what they chosen  to do or whatever.  But, so why can't you just go in there?  Uh, if they want you, if they let you touch them, you touch them.  You want to drink?  You can drink.  Uh, if they want to take all their clothes off, they could take all their clothes.  What the hell?  Who honed in on that action? 
[00:23:00]  I don't know.  As a politician and just kind of ruined it for everybody.  They need to put their panties on.  And I will make sure all the strip clubs have girls that are wearing clothing.  What?  Why?  Why?  Why don't you worry about the traffic problem?  Yeah.  In and around New York City.  I'm not voting for you.  No, I'm not either.  And we've said it before.  Once that happens, you can never get the guy that's going to run on the platform of,  I will get the strip clubs to take off the panties. 
[00:23:30]  That would be a kook.  Yeah.  Who isn't voting for a man?  You know what?  Unfortunately, a lot of people aren't.  A bunch of do-gooders.  All right.  Let's stay out of Mike in Syracuse.  We've got to take a break.  But we're going to try to figure out which animal has the best technique today.  We just made this up on the spot.  We're crazy.  I'll tell you who has the worst technique on the planet.  What?  Human beings.  Yeah, well.  Humans just look silly. 
[00:24:00]  Like, at least the animal kingdom, there's some, like, brr to it.  There's, like, there's viciousness to it.  It's almost like a fight.  And people having sex, and I'm not talking about porno.  Porno, they kind of figured out how to make it look really cool.  But your average Joe and Jane laying in bed, it just looks silly.  Oh, because everyone's body conscious.  Yeah.  They're not body conscious in the animal kingdom.  Ever in a hotel where there's a mirror, and you just, like, glance over at yourself going at it, 
[00:24:30]  and you go, like, wow, that just looks, I'm glad we're the only two people in this room,  because that just looks silly.  Believe me, feels great, looks silly.  You've got to stop wearing it.  That's why you can't videotape yourself and then watch it back.  You know, if you're ever going to take a camcorder and hook it up to the television,  that's fine and dandy.  Don't put a tape in.  Just run it in camera mode so you can kind of watch it on TV if that's what you want to do.  But taping it, what are you going to use that for?  You're going to watch it later and go, hey, look at that.  Hold on, hold on, hold on. 
[00:25:00]  Is that what you do?  I've done it in the past.  You seemed a little too familiar with the camcorder to the TV.  Dude, when camcorders were, like, really getting popular, and I picked one up,  you've got to do that.  You kind of, you know, set up the camera and the TV and go, see what this looks like.  But you don't put a tape in.  You know, you just let it run like a monitor.  You're monitoring it.  Why wouldn't you tape it if you're the only one going to watch it, though?  Because I'm never going to watch it.  Why would I want to watch that?  Why wouldn't you?  You just don't watch it.  Yeah.  All the season finales are happening now. 
[00:25:30]  You're going to need something to watch on TV.  American Idol's over.  First of all, I never wanted anything on tape just in case.  Because you just don't know where the hell that might end up.  What do you want to do?  If there's a Yankee rain delay, do you want to watch the Greg Nettles years?  Hey, Nettles was good.  Hey, let's say hi to Mike in Syracuse.  I got to tell you, I was talking to my friend Dan Murphy yesterday from Syracuse,  and he told me that we're blowing up in Syracuse.  So good morning to Syracuse. 
[00:26:00]  What's up, Mike?  Good morning, guys.  We're wide awake.  We wake up early to listen.  Nice.  Cool.  What's up?  Anyways, okay.  Down here in Syracuse, we've got a couple clubs, and there's no alcohol,  so there's no bathing suits.  But next door, there's a bar, so you can always walk next door.  But you get your own room with a lap dance,  and so for every 20 bucks you drop, you get that next level.  Oh, so if you drop 40, they get a little more than if you give 20. 
[00:26:30]  Is there actual sex going on?  You know, I'm broke, so I don't know.  He's never been able to completely level up.  He's never reached the last plateau.  We dropped, me and my buddy dropped 100 bucks there,  and we were both shirtless, and she was completely lacking her bathing suit.  You can stay totally new.  Totally new.  Totally new.  All right.  Kingdom and nakedness.  Punch it out, guys.  Thank you, and once again, good morning to Syracuse. 
[00:27:00]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  You guys ready?  Good luck, Jordan.  Good luck, Blake.  Give him the lights.  Here we go.  After a world record vote of 74 million,  I don't care, he does not care.  The winner of American Idol 2007 is... 
[00:27:30]  I'm happy, no lucky.  Women call me quick, but lucky.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't...  He does not care.  Jordan Stump.  I don't care.  It's The Opie and Anthony Show, yes.  I don't care.  American Idol is finally over, and whatever.  Is Jordan a male or a female?  Exactly.  Last night, when I was watching the finale last night,  just the last couple of minutes, whenever they announced the winner. 
[00:28:00]  They turned it into an award show last night.  It was ridiculous.  Oops, that's still playing.  Okay.  I don't care.  And I was watching, and they announced the winner as Jordan,  and I swear I thought the guy won.  They both hugged, and I'm like, oh, look at that.  The guy, you know, the guy won.  Beatbox dude.  And apparently that wasn't Jordan.  No, well...  See, this is how little I cared about this season.  Jordan is the youngest American Idol winner.  She's 17. 
[00:28:30]  She's the daughter of a football player, Sparks there.  Oh, Felipe Sparks.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's his daughter.  And she's kind of built like a linebacker with a beautiful face.  Big girl.  She's beautiful in the face.  Yeah.  But when they film her from behind, and you see those broad shoulders...  Oh, yeah.  She's a biggin'.  She's got a lot on her.  And she's only 17, so oof.  Is she a good singer?  She still has youth on her side, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, she definitely improved throughout the season there, Jimmy. 
[00:29:00]  I know way too much about this American Idol.  I think I was watching it just to be informed for this dumb show.  Oof.  I couldn't even.  Because Melinda Doolittle was the best in the competition, but you knew what you were  getting right off the bat.  And Jordan Sparks improved week after week after week and really started to impress everybody  near the end there.  She's got a great voice.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Enough.  Glad it's over.  It's over, Johnny.  Yes.  We were supposed to start with this cute story because we were waking up the strippers. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  That are working their way through college.  And then you had a brilliant observation that maybe they're just going to bed right  now.  Yeah, probably just getting home.  And then we went off on a little tangent.  Coke bender.  Because it's Pot Talk Thursday.  And well, now we're back on track.  And this is the story we wanted to play about 15 minutes ago.  Is this yours?  Yes, ma'am.  Okay.  By day, she works at Blue Line Coffee Shop.  Selling cappuccino and scones.  We do triple last paper here?  Yeah. 
[00:30:00]  As a sociology student studying in Europe, 22-year-old Jenny Heinemann became interested  in another line of work.  Seeking a course on sexuality and culture and got introduced to the kind of underground  culture of sex work and became very interested in the rights of sex workers.  Sex workers, like strippers.  Upon returning to the States, just my curiosity, I guess, and my desire to work with these 
[00:30:30]  women led me to get a job.  There you go, folks.  Here we go.  Kitty, coming up next.  Not just any job.  Jenny to the stage, please.  Yeah.  By night, Jenny dances at the 20s Club.  This is what I don't get.  So she's in college, right?  She works at a coffee shop during the day.  Why?  Yeah.  If you're stripping at night and getting the big bucks at night, why would you work at  the coffee shop?  Just to have the illusion that you're just a college kid with a regular college type job? 
[00:31:00]  And she should be making enough money stripping.  That's what I'm saying.  Unless she's the worst stripper in the world.  Yeah.  Coming home with change.  All she thinks of her scones.  What does she look like?  Anybody?  All right.  Well, she's running a thesis on her experience and other strippers.  I probably go up on stage maybe four times in a five-hour shift. 
[00:31:30]  And I'm constantly thinking, please don't fall.  Ha, ha, ha.  We're thinking fall.  She looks like her stuff in five-inch heels.  And the rest of the time is...  Wait a minute.  That's her?  Oh, you scared me.  Because that looks like the chick that used to be on Trump's show, The Apprentice.  The blonde that was in the boardroom helping with the decisions.  Yuck.  You scared...  Ew.  Was that her? 
[00:32:00]  Is that her right there?  She's kind of cute.  I mean, she's deceptive.  She's got the red hair and the glasses.  She looks like that singer.  Lisa Loeb.  Yeah.  She looks like Lisa Loeb.  She looks like Lisa Loeb.  A chubby Lisa Loeb.  Yeah.  She's a little...  Well, do they show her, like, dancing a little bit?  Yeah.  Do they, Danny?  Yeah.  They show her stripping and she looks exponentially better with all the makeup.  All right.  Time out.  Time out.  I'm calling a time out on the show.  Uh-oh. 
[00:32:30]  Time out.  E-Rock, you're wrecking the Dance Dance Danny bit.  You know that, right?  See, when he walks in the door, even if we're in the middle of something, then his music  plays, because then everyone out there in radio land goes, oh, Danny must be entering  the studio.  Danny's in.  You don't start his music when he talks on mic.  He's already in here.  And when you pause the show, oh, shouldn't he pause the video that we're watching?  Yeah, of course.  Of course.  In conjunction with the story that we're talking about?  Yeah, of course.  Well, it's too late now, don't you?  I think you officially ruined the Dance Dance Danny bit. 
[00:33:00]  No.  Yes, I really do.  Danny, go ahead.  Well, what I was saying was that when she puts the makeup on in her stripping routine,  she looks exponentially better than she does working at the coffee show.  Oh, really?  Okay.  All right.  Hold on.  I want to go over there and break Eric's shaking fingers.  Eric doesn't even get it.  As a joke, I'm going, press it now.  Like, as Danny was talking, he should have hit the music again.  Hit it again.  Because then the joke would be on him.  Right.  Right, right, right. 
[00:33:30]  And his hand is hovering.  He's so nervous.  His hand is hovering.  He's like, no.  He said he loved the button.  Opie didn't tell me to.  What's the matter with you?  Everyone else is going, hit the button.  It would have been funny.  It takes the heat off you.  It's almost like an F you to everybody.  Yeah, it would have been funny.  Yeah.  Oh, you don't know funny.  Thank you, Danny.  It was good seeing you on the show.  Here I go.  There goes Danny, everybody.  And how do we know he's leaving?  Because the music's playing.  Good job, E-Rock.  So long, Danny. 
[00:34:00]  Until next time.  Yeah.  She's learned to strut her stuff in five-inch heels.  And the rest of the time is spent kind of mingling with customers and...  Customers?  Doing dances for customers at tables.  See, this is the problem, man.  They're taking the sex out of the strip clubs by calling us now customers.  Customers.  And they're like exotic dancers and...  Stop.  There she is on the pole.  Okay.  Customers?  Roll that.  There she is. 
[00:34:30]  Ew.  I'm not...  I can see why she's at the coffee shop.  I think she's enjoying the treats a little too much at the coffee shop.  Yeah.  A few too many scones.  Yeah, you think the scones are fat-free,  but they're not.  I give you a little bit of a belly there.  Yeah.  Doing dances for customers at tables.  This is the first time the 20s Club has allowed a camera inside.  Ooh.  But the club is still protective of its customers and dancers.  Jenny is the only one allowed to appear on camera. 
[00:35:00]  Her experience with the customers and her fellow workers at the 20s Club  eventually became the subject of her honors thesis at UNO,  entitled Work and Gender,  a Midwest strip club ethnography.  Ethnography.  I want to take that stripper's glasses and step on them.  Like Woody Allen and take the money and run.  The nerve of that phony to try to sound like a genius  who's going to step into the whore industry for a while.  God, it's irritating. 
[00:35:30]  In between making lattes.  Can we hear the name of that?  I can't remember what she just said.  The name of that, possibly again?  The name of what?  The thesis?  Her thesis.  Oh, I think I got it.  It's with the customers and her fellow workers at the 20s Club  eventually became the subject of her honors thesis at UNO,  entitled Work and Gender,  a Midwest strip club ethnography.  Ethnography?  Ethnography.  Ethnography.  What?  No one knows.  Did we stump Anthony? 
[00:36:00]  Ethnography.  What is that?  Ethnography?  E-T-H-N-O-G-R-A-P-H-Y.  Ethnography.  Is it any type of a history of a certain ethnicity?  That's one that I can think of.  I would think, yeah,  ography, you know,  some type of...  Some type of og.  Og.  Ography.  And then, um,  eth being, um,  of the E-T-H variety.  I hope the definition is  to ethno.  To ethno. 
[00:36:30]  All right.  Ethno.  The location of the eth...  Ethno.  Ethnography.  Okay.  A branch of anthropology  dealing with the scientific description  of individual cultures.  Oh, okay.  And it's kind of like ethnic, uh...  All right.  Here we go.  And finally...  Why did she have to call it that?  Why couldn't she call, uh,  I made coffee and stripped...  Yeah.  ...by, and then put her name?  Why would you try to sell...  Because she's a smarty pants.  Let's call it stripper diaries.  Yeah.  Diaries of a stripper.  Something dumb like that.  Exactly. 
[00:37:00]  Or things I thought  while I was lap dancing  some creepy business male  with dumpster breath.  I want to be honest about it.  Well, that's the subtitle.  You know how you have the...  You have the catchy title  and then underneath it...  Yeah.  ...it would be what Jimmy said.  All right.  So it would be stripper diaries  and then subtitle what?  Uh, thoughts I've had  while giving lap dances  to creepy business men  with dumpster breath.  You know she...  She doesn't shut up  about this too  at the strip club.  Yeah.  Like, like, you know,  in between songs  which is the worst time  for a stripper  when they kind of cover up  and start talking to you 
[00:37:30]  about their life.  And yeah, I'm doing  a thesis on this.  Are ya?  And then...  Great.  And then you as Joe Businessman  you look her right in the eye  and go,  if I wanted to hear you talk  if I wanted to hear a woman talk  I'd go home.  Messed up the line.  He didn't.  Yeah, he did.  No, he didn't.  Oh.  Apparently the machine  says different.  All right.  And, uh, well,  this is what she's trying  to get done  with her ethnography. 
[00:38:00]  Ethnography.  I think it's a very,  very worthwhile topic  for us to really look at.  Professor and chair  of UNO's sociology  anthropology department,  Shireen Rajaram,  applauds Jenny Heineman's courage  and says...  Tiny man.  ...kind of first-hand account  can sociologists identify  real issues  and dispel stereotypes.  I mean, it's a huge industry.  Oh.  Right?  And so I think  it is important for us  as sociologists,  as anthropologists  to really shed light  on some of the issues, 
[00:38:30]  especially the social injustices.  Jenny says...  Oh, my God.  ...is the stigma  placed on her fellow dancers.  Yeah.  You know, a lot of these women  are doing this  to support their families.  Several of them  are single mothers.  They work very hard  in a job that can be  quite tiresome.  If nothing...  See, I don't get it  because it's happening  in the porn industry, too.  Like, we've had a lot  of porn stars on our show  and strippers  and they want some kind  of, like, respect  for what they do.  Sorry.  It's like, sorry.  I'm not going to sit here  and, like, verbally abuse you 
[00:39:00]  or something,  but I'm not going to respect you  because you're a porn star  and now you have to be...  What are they...  They're called the exotic...  What are they called now?  Adult film stars.  Adult film stars.  You can't really even  call them porn stars anymore.  But I don't know  what myths  are they trying to dispel here.  Like, okay,  some of them are single moms.  Well, I'm surprised.  You mean some of them  don't have healthy relationships?  I find that hard to believe.  And some of them  support their families  and everyone knows that.  It's not a family.  It's a boyfriend  who does meth  and hits them. 
[00:39:30]  We've all seen  the suitcase pimps  dragging them.  What are you talking...  Where's the myths?  This is...  Yeah, I think they should  leave it to the people  that actually frequent  the clubs  and see these girls,  a lot of different ones,  and are able to take  a nice sample  of these girls.  You realize that  they are usually  very effed up  alcoholics,  drug addicts  in horrible relationships  with a lot of  abusive men.  Where's the stereotype?  Yeah, look,  if you're looking for respect,  then don't be a stripper. 
[00:40:00]  If you're making  $1,000 a night  and more,  you're not really  going to get  a lot of respect.  Daddy issues.  If you want respect,  go get a job  as a secretary, toots.  That's it.  And if you wanted  to spell myths,  have customers go,  you know,  after the song was over,  she sat and talked  with me for free.  Yeah.  There you go.  For free, yeah.  It was great.  She's really smart.  She didn't ask me  to buy her a drink.  She gave me her real name?  Yeah.  All right.  Spelling myths?  Stop it.  Here's the end of the story.  They work very hard 
[00:40:30]  and a jet can be  quite tiresome.  If nothing else,  she hopes to raise  awareness of inequities  and earn the dancers  the respect she thinks  they deserve.  Get to know  your local stripper.  That's the message.  We should end on that.  Oh, great.  There you go.  To all you serial killers  out there,  get to know your local.  Yeah, just get to know.  Start stalking.  Start stalking.  Yeah, because that's  what the local stripper wants,  to actually get to know  the customers.  Get to know her.  Yeah, all right. 
[00:41:00]  Strippers don't want  to know us.  They don't want to know them.  All these guys  that are going in there  want to know  the strippers more.  They look at you  as a wallet,  a faceless,  nameless wallet.  More money, please.  Get to know  your local stripper.  What a delusional ass.  Could you imagine  you're the dummy  going into a strip club  because you saw that story  like,  I just want to get to know you.  I just want to...  Hey,  so, uh...  Did you see that news report?  Did you watch  American Idol last night? 
[00:41:30]  I couldn't believe  Jordan won.  Yeah.  Excuse me,  are you going to pay  for the next lap dance  or what?  If not,  I'm going to move on  to the guy next to you.  And she will move on.  I'm just getting to know you.  I saw a report  about you girls.  Right.  And, you know,  you do deserve  a little more respect.  Shut up.  Cough up some cash  or I'm moving on.  Look, you know,  both sides know the deal.  Simple as that.  It was a phony story.  It was phony.  The way they were all  trying to doll it up  with brilliant language. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  If you strip  and you wanted to strip  and you made good money,  good for you.  Yeah.  Talk to the poor saps  leaving broke  who have to explain  to their wives  when they have no money.  Because the wife  won't have sex with them  and the stripper  led them on.  She pretended  she wanted to get to know me  and then when I was broke  she didn't.  Right, right.  She got to know me  until I ran out of money.  That's what happens.  That's it.  You're on the clock with them.  Yeah.  All right.  Not that I blame the strippers though.  I'm sure most guys  that go in are awful.  You know,  most people  that I don't want to talk to  for more than 30 seconds  they have to sit on their lap  and pretend  that the guy's funny and cute. 
[00:42:30]  But that's the deal.  Like,  that's the give and take  of both sides.  You know,  how about  they do a news story  on the guys  that frequent these clubs  much too much.  You know,  the guys that are in there a lot.  I'm not talking about  the occasional  go out with your friends thing.  But the guys that are in there  all the time.  Do a story on how  they should be respected  because they're supporting  these girls.  No,  there are a bunch of creeps  running in there.  We used to talk about  all the different types of guys  that would go in.  We'd point them out. 
[00:43:00]  There's old guy.  There's naive guy  who thinks he's going  to get something.  He's going to get a relationship.  At the end of the night.  There's the sap  who just gets drained  of cash  all night long.  And there's  He's the go-to guy.  Cheapo.  Yeah.  That cheap guy  that hones in  on other people's action.  Other people's lap dances.  If you're sitting next to it,  you got to sit next to the sap.  Let's just put it this way.  You're changing seats a lot.  Yeah.  Throughout the night.  The best place to sit  is next to the sap.  The guy that just keeps 
[00:43:30]  the money coming out  and coming out  because then you're  right next to him.  So you're able to look  and see everything he's seeing.  You get some good angles too.  You don't want to sit  next to the old guy  that's like penny pinching.  There you go.  Bad seat.  Let's go to Jason  in Connecticut.  Jason.  Hey, what's going on guys?  Hey.  I have actually written  an ethnography  for one of my grad courses  and maybe I could  shed a little light  on what it is.  Boy, can't wait  to hear this.  Great.  Well, unfortunately  for this woman  an ethnography 
[00:44:00]  is not a bullet  between the eyes  but it's part of...  Hold on a second.  Sir?  Ant?  Yeah.  I was...  Hold on.  Okay.  Halfway rebound.  Go!  No.  No.  Oh my.  I'd tell you something.  How did that not go in?  Go ahead, sir.  Yeah.  All right.  Tough morning.  Anyways.  Well, it is tough  morning Thursday.  Yeah, true.  It's part of  social anthropology. 
[00:44:30]  So this woman  is basically trying  to say that  strippers are their own  almost race of people  that are unique  in their own way.  Well, I know what it is.  We just ran out of stuff  to write about.  Yeah.  Basically.  That's what it comes down  to like...  This lovely lady  probably went to her teacher  and said,  I want to write  an ethnography  on poor people,  on migrant workers, 
[00:45:00]  on illegal aliens.  And the teacher's like,  no, no, no, no, no.  Dull, dull.  Done, done.  Everyone has done that.  And this is the last thing  to write about.  Let me get the stripper.  Oh, controversial.  Oh, I like it.  A little controversial,  but that's good.  That's good.  All right, Jason.  Thank you.  And I'll tell you,  I...  I do respect strippers  as a real job.  I mean,  a lot of these girls  are making $150,000,  $200,000.  Good for you.  If you can make  that kind of money  doing something like that  and drinking and hanging out  all night,  I mean,  knock yourself out. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah,  but don't expect to  get the respect  of a woman  that's,  I don't know,  built herself up  in the workplace.  I don't know about that.  I never know how she...  I mean,  some of them build themselves  up legitimately,  but strippers are fine with me.  No, I'm talking about  the ones that slept  their way to the top.  Those...  Respect them.  That makes you want  to be the boss.  All right,  let's go to Philly.  Keith,  listening on WISP.  What's up,  Keith?  What's going on,  boys?  How's it going?  All right.  Good evening.  Anthony,  you need to congratulate  yourself for not knowing  what ethnography is today. 
[00:46:00]  It is one of the most BS filled  things that grad student does.  Everyone does it  and I had to do one  recently on my school  in Philadelphia  and you realize yourself,  I'm just observing  how animals act  and basically,  this is what someone said,  I hang out at a strip bar,  let me observe them.  That's what they did.  They took the least  constructive thing  they could have done  with their life  and they made a grade  out of it  and good for him  for doing it.  How much have you been  taking for a strip club, 
[00:46:30]  sir?  What's that?  Sounds like a very  bitter customer.  Yeah,  you seem a little better.  How much money  have you been taking for?  Take the fifth.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  He fell in love with one.  He believed her  and then she skipped town.  One more before the break  because it is  phone call.  Thursday.  Thursday.  Victor on Long Island,  what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  Hey.  The fact of the matter is  strippers don't have a soul.  Yeah, that's true.  They have no soul. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, it's true.  Look right into their eyes.  You'll see nothing.  Yeah.  You'll see absolutely nothing.  The soul was extracted  by some evil father  or stepfather years ago  and never grew back.  The evil stepfather  took her soul.  Coming to theaters  Friday.  See, I think strippers  are givers.  I think they're very  because they take  complete zeros  and they put their  heinies on that man's lap.  That man should be  paying for that.  Strip clubs are made  for guys that are  like in their teens 
[00:47:30]  that get into a strip club  and it's very exciting  at that point.  Dude, I remember  going to my first strip club  when I turned 18.  Danny's Den  out there on,  well now it's a parking lot  for a supermarket  on Jericho.  Yeah.  I was out of my mind.  I'm like,  what?  This goes on?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because before that,  you know,  if you're lucky,  you get to see  a little something something.  It was two dimensional.  Two dimensional magazines.  Mostly two dimensional.  Magazines,  things like that.  But yeah,  mine was the tender trap  over there on Jericho Turnpike. 
[00:48:00]  Jericho Turnpike  was just loaded  with those.  Well, tender trap's  still rocking, right?  Yeah, I think it's still there.  I think they finally  remodeled after 30 years.  Oh, place stunk.  Walked in there,  they had that shag carpeting  that was there for ages  and it just smelled  like stripper  when you walked in there.  But I remember  as a teen boy  walking in there  way underage  but whoever was behind the bar,  I think it was some biker guy  gave me a beer.  I paid for it 
[00:48:30]  in like a dollar  and a few quarters  and just sat there  and milked that beer  for about three hours  and the guy was kind of  getting a laugh out of it  because I was just sitting there  staring at the girls  and breathing heavy  and I just was like  forget about it.  Once I got home,  I had a change.  I had a change.  It was just a wreck.  It senses overload, man.  Yeah.  It was great  when that first girl came out  and she's dancing around  in like her little  little nighty type thing 
[00:49:00]  and then you're going  is she going to take this off?  Does this come off?  And then you're like  oh my gosh,  she's topless.  I'm looking at real boobies.  And you just all freaked out  about the whole thing.  It was just this  sensory overload, man.  Oh, it was great.  Sensory overload.  And then I walked out  with a buzz on  because I had one beer.  I couldn't walk straight  because certain things  were happening  and I had to walk home 
[00:49:30]  hunched over.  You know.  And the light hit me  and it was like  walking out of  out of Dorothy's house  into Oz.  Everything was a new color  and it was  it was a new world for me.  I was thinking Brubaker.  Brubaker after being in the  yeah,  after spending 30 days  in the hole  you're just there  in the pitch blackness  and you open up  you got to squint.  You know,  going back to Little League  after that,  just that.  Yeah,  that opened up.  It just changed.  It kind of lost its fun.  My whole life changed  after that.  All of a sudden  you're like  you're with your pals  like hey,  you want to go to the yard 
[00:50:00]  you know,  the schoolyard  and play some baseball?  Ah.  Just doesn't have the same.  I think I have a new game  for you guys.  Yeah.  My mom's like  you know,  Anthony,  why don't you play  with your microscope  and chemistry set anymore?  Ah.  Let me tell you something,  Ro.  It just ain't  it ain't doing it  for me anymore.  And then dad finally  is like  it's about time  you can tell me that.  Hey,  there you go.  He's a man,  Ro.  He went to the strip club.  Finally.  Finally. 
[00:50:30]  Maybe he'll stop whining.  All my little dinosaur toys  went into a box  and got stored away  in the basement  never did see the light  of day again.  It was over.  Yeah.  Yep.  No more watching  Wonderama on Sundays.  Now it's like  going through  like cable channels.  Sorry,  Bob McAllister.  Now it's  now you would  you would go through  cable channels  that are scrambled  and hope to get  a peek of something.  Looking for something good.  Definitely a life changing 
[00:51:00]  moment right there.  Absolutely.  Hey,  you want to go ride bikes?  Ah.  I've seen the promised land.  Ah,  no.  Mom,  sell my bike.  I don't need it anymore.  Yeah,  don't need it.  Get in a car.  All right.  You're 12.  Yeah,  it's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show  on 92.3  free FM.  Good morning.  Welcome to the  Opie and Anthony show.  What is America  talking about today?  American Idol. 
[00:51:30]  Jordan won.  Whatever.  Pirates of the Caribbean  gets two stars  in our local paper  here in New York City.  What is Rotten Tomatoes  saying about  Pirates of the Caribbean  or the Caribbean?  However.  What other movies  are starting Friday?  Isn't this the weekend  for all the movies?  Oh,  yeah.  It's the summer season.  Officially starts?  Yeah.  Pirates of the Caribbean.  That's what I say, 
[00:52:00]  but other people  like to say Caribbean.  Yeah.  Both are acceptable.  And, of course,  America's talking about  Rosie and Elizabeth Hasselbeck  going at it  on The View yesterday.  Yeah,  that was a heated exchange.  Not a fan.  A little personal.  Really not a fan  of either one of them.  I like how Rosie,  you know,  believes in stuff  and doesn't care  and just speaks her mind.  I respect that.  I think she's nuts,  though.  But she's crazy.  And Elizabeth Hasselbeck  is just always in  way over her head.  Way over her head.  She should just be doing 
[00:52:30]  the cute little  entertainment stories  for The View.  She shouldn't be  talking politics  whatsoever.  Well, she's so  completely on the right  wing.  And she's not very  informed.  And Rosie completely  on the left,  which makes it  very interesting  to begin with.  She blindly follows  the party line.  Well, both sides  blindly follow.  Yeah, yeah.  Absolutely.  Rosie's a better talker  than she is.  Yeah, Rosie can rip her apart  because Rosie's a comic  contrary to popular belief. 
[00:53:00]  We got some highlights,  but do yourself a favor  and get on one of the  video sites.  You know, we like  Break.com these days  and watch the whole thing.  It is some great,  great TV.  It really is.  I was talking to someone  that is about the age  of Elizabeth Hasselbeck.  And this person said  that she's an embarrassment  to all women  of that age group.  Really?  That this person  should not be  representing us.  Absolutely.  And the best moment  I ever had  watching Elizabeth Hasselbeck 
[00:53:30]  look like a fool  was on Hannity and Combs  when they just spanked  her around  and taught her  about the First Amendment.  When the whole  Imus thing was going on,  they decided Elizabeth  needed to be on Hannity and Combs  for what reason,  I don't know.  And she was gloating  and so happy  that Imus was thrown  off the air.  Really?  And yeah,  we're not going to get  into that per se,  but what I want to say,  Alan Combs  just gave her  a schooling  on the First Amendment.  and she sat there  and she realized  that she was in  way over her head  and even her good looks 
[00:54:00]  couldn't save her  and she was just like  looking into the camera  all dopey and stupid  and trying to fight  her way out.  Started stripping.  And then Hannity  just the closer  comes in.  Alan Combs  pitched a great game  and then Hannity  just comes in  and like  just struck her out.  Oh,  it was just  some of the best TV ever.  What's she going to do?  When I was at home  laughing like Robert De Niro  in the back of a theater.  I was just so happy. 
[00:54:30]  So happy  that she got schooled  because she  doesn't belong  in that forum  talking about politics.  Well,  I think they both  take it a little  too personally.  Well,  they hate each other.  And obviously  they hate each other.  They talk about  their friendship  but there's so much  sarcasm in it  when they're talking  about it.  Yeah.  You just know  these two  really don't  like each other  and it's all  based on their  political ideology.  See,  now Rosie's 
[00:55:00]  not going to be  on The View today.  She's saying  that her wife  or husband,  I don't know.  Who's the guy?  I think she's the guy.  So it's her wife.  Actually,  Lindsay goes yesterday,  so who do you think  the husband is?  And I'm like,  are you kidding me?  Rosie.  Yeah,  man,  that's an obvious one.  Rosie is so the guy  in that relationship.  Which do you have to be  to make Rosie the girl?  Yeah,  exactly.  So her,  are they married?  What are they?  I don't know.  They're happy,  whatever.  I don't know what the  politically correct term is  for a girl living with  another girl. 
[00:55:30]  Hot.  Her mate is turning 40,  so Rosie's not going to be  on The View this morning.  And rumor has it  that Rosie might be done.  She might just say,  you know what,  I got only three,  four weeks left.  I'm done.  But I hope she goes back  on The View because  something amazing  is going to happen  before Rosie's run is over.  Something just beyond amazing,  even better than the video  that came out yesterday.  I lost all respect  for Rosie O'Donnell  and anything she has to say  because occasionally  she'd say stuff  and you'd be like,  yeah,  okay, 
[00:56:00]  I could almost  go with that.  But when she started  talking about the buildings,  the 9-11 buildings  and the government conspiracy,  just eating up the drivel  that is on some  of these conspiracy websites,  buying the complete lies  that aren't backed up  with any fact whatsoever,  that's when I just went,  Rosie, shut up.  Yeah.  And she's on the show  just preaching it  like it's gospel  and it's just a bunch of crap  and she's buying  and that whole thing. 
[00:56:30]  Goodbye.  I can't listen to a word  she says now.  Well, let's listen in  on Rosie and Elizabeth.  And I, you know,  it's tough to take sides  because they're both  what they are.  Here it is.  It's two people  on the opposite ends  of the spectrum  that have no middle ground.  Right.  The same people  are the people  that are in the middle  and can take ideas  from both sides.  This is two crazy people  who are so far 
[00:57:00]  on either side  that they're exactly the same.  These two people  don't realize  how close they are  in ideology.  They're just separated  by the differences  in the opinion  but their passion for it  is how crazy they are.  There's two things I love.  I don't agree  with what Rosie's all about.  I really don't.  But I appreciate  how Rosie talks down  to Elizabeth  and plays with her  like she's just  a cute cat.  Yeah.  Like she doesn't want 
[00:57:30]  to give the real hard hits  because it's just  a cute little thing.  Yeah, she obviously...  And I'm a big fan  of just watching Elizabeth  look completely stupid  on TV.  She's obviously  just being sarcastic.  I don't care  who does it to her.  I'm a huge fan of that.  She's condescending.  Yeah.  Well, Rosie didn't get by  on her looks.  It's one thing  as much as I find  a lot of what she says  repulsive.  Hey, look,  at least she made a living  being funny.  I mean, she didn't get  where she is  by being cute.  Excuse me.  Do you remember  the movie  where she dressed  as a dominatrix?  Yeah, hello.  How hot was that? 
[00:58:00]  What was that movie again?  Oh, there it is.  Yeah.  Now that is how  we want to see Rosie.  She doesn't look that bad.  Oh, shut up,  Jimmy Norton.  La, la,  I am not listening  to Jimmy Norton.  Why?  She is a slob  in that.  Oh, is that her?  Yeah.  I thought that was  Philip Seymour Hoffman  who said,  all right, thank you, Jimmy.  Exactly.  I thought we lost you.  What's wrong with you?  Philip Seymour Hoffman  and that stupid hair.  For a second, 
[00:58:30]  I thought we lost you.  All right, listen,  let's get into this a little bit.  Some highlights  from the big fight.  But like I said,  if you have time today,  do yourself a favor  and watch the long form  because it's just great.  Because Joy Behar  started the whole thing.  Yeah, she throws  in some funny quits.  Then there's a nice  tag team going on,  Rosie and Joy  versus Elizabeth.  And Elizabeth  just getting madder  and madder  because she wants  to be heard.  Yeah.  And everyone's like,  will you shut up?  You used to eat bugs  on TV.  What'd you do?  Just stop.  She used to eat bugs.  She was on Survivor  eating bugs 
[00:59:00]  and looking just like  hot and skinny  and stuff.  We're excited  for not demanding  a pull-out date  for our troops.  Which is essentially  saying to your enemies,  I don't know any team  out there,  I don't know any plan.  Here's the date  we are going to have  to your enemies.  This is what  we are going to pull out.  The enemies in Iraq?  Al-Qaeda?  Wait, the enemies in Iraq?  He didn't even go after  Osama bin Laden  when he was supposed to.  Wait, Joy.  You just said  our enemies in Iraq.  Did Iraq attack us?  No, I'm saying Al-Qaeda. 
[00:59:30]  Okay.  Did Iraq attack us,  Elizabeth?  Iraq did not.  Listen to this.  Listen to the road.  Yeah.  Did Iraq attack us,  Elizabeth?  Oh, if someone  talks to me like that,  I'm getting up  and we're going  to have a problem.  Even that isn't  really a good argument.  You don't necessarily  have to be attacked  by a country  to go in  and have a military action.  Yeah.  Now, in this case,  obviously,  people have their opinions,  but that isn't really  the end-all argument 
[01:00:00]  here.  Were we attacked  by them?  Oh, then we shouldn't  be there.  Afghanistan didn't  attack us either,  but we all know  who is hiding  and Mr. You-Know-Who.  People hiding,  so you've got to  drop a few bombs.  I'm saying Al-Qaeda.  Okay.  Did Iraq attack us,  Elizabeth?  Iraq did not attack us,  Rosie.  We've been there before.  I'm saying our enemies,  Al-Qaeda.  Are you hearing that?  I hear it,  but where do you want  to go, Bob?  We're going to...  Political discussion.  Don't interview  each other.  Just you.  I love the sarcasm.  She answers the question.  She goes, 
[01:00:30]  Correct.  Correct.  Did they...  Wait, wait.  I want my point to...  Did they attack us?  Did they?  Did they?  That's a great part of them.  Rosie and Elizabeth,  they are what each other hates.  Yeah.  Elizabeth is the entitled,  hot, spoiled brat,  and Rosie is like  the mediocre fat chick  that is smarter than she is  and is louder than...  Rosie is like the female Patrice  who could just smack her around.  More quick-witted, yeah.  Because the things  that usually get her by with men  can't get her by 
[01:01:00]  with someone like...  Elizabeth wants people  to desperately think  that she's smarter than she is.  Can I say that  during this discussion,  if someone walked in  and shot all of us dead,  it would be justified.  We're actually...  We're talking about the view  going,  well, yeah,  but Elizabeth does this.  And I'm like,  yeah, but then Rosie backs up.  You go...  Discussing the view  like it's a football game.  We should have our heads blown away.  All right, here we go.  More, more, more.  The enemy's the enemy.  Please, let's have a conversation.  You know why?  I don't want to do this, Joy.  No, let me tell you  why I don't want to do it.  Let me do it.  Because here's how it gets  spun in the media. 
[01:01:30]  Rosie,  big, fat,  lesbian,  loud Rosie,  attacks innocent,  pure Christian Elizabeth.  And I'm not doing it  for the rest of the...  Let me do it.  I haven't heard that line.  Listen, I think that's unfair.  You should watch some of the shows  that you know you don't watch.  You accused me of watching  all of those shows yesterday.  Rosie's a lesbian.  Heated.  She just came out  right there on the view.  She said it.  I just don't understand  why it's my fault  if people spin words  that you put out there  or phrases that suggest things.  And I gave you an opportunity 
[01:02:00]  two days ago  to clarify the statement  that got you in trouble  on all of those things.  I did that as a friend.  That got me in trouble.  As a friend,  you gave me the opportunity.  That was very sweet of you.  What I was asking is you  who actually knows me.  Yes.  Do you believe  I think our troops  are terrorists, Elizabeth?  I don't think that you...  Do you believe that?  Yes or no?  Excuse me.  Let me speak.  You're going to double speak.  It's just a yes or a no.  I am not a double speaker  and I don't put suggestions  out there  that lead people  to think things 
[01:02:30]  and then not answer  my own question.  What?  I would say  I would answer that  yes, I do think  Rosie thinks our troops  are terrorists.  And everything she has said  would lead me to believe  she thinks our troops  are terrorists.  She always talks about  the Iraqi dead  and who's doing it,  our soldiers.  They're not supposed  to be there.  So I put all of this together  in thinking yes,  Rosie O'Donnell  would think that  our troops are terrorists.  No, I think that she... 
[01:03:00]  And here's how the semantics  she'd get out of it.  I don't think she thinks  that the individual troops are  because she knows  they're being told  to go where they're going.  She would say  I don't believe that  but the technicality is  she believes that  they're agents of a terrorist.  Do you understand that?  She would probably say  no, I don't believe  the troops are terrorists  but whoever it is  that's sending them there  is a terrorist.  But that's how she's...  So then Al-Qaeda,  the actual people  that strapped the bombs  to themselves  wouldn't be terrorists.  It's the people that  are in charge  and sending them out.  I mean, it's semantics.  I really do think  she believes  that our troops 
[01:03:30]  are being used  as terrorists then.  Everything she said  leads me to believe that.  So if I was that  blonde bitch over there  and talking about that...  I call her the bimbo.  If I was the bimbo,  I wouldn't be on the show.  I'd be in front of it  mirror naked  just toying with myself.  But if I had to speak  I would have said yes.  Yeah, there you go.  I have a question to you  and you didn't answer it.  I don't believe  that you believe  troops are terrorists.  I have said that before  but when you say something  like 650,000 
[01:04:00]  Iraqis are dead.  We invaded them.  Let me finish.  You don't like the facts.  Who are terrorists?  I am all about facts.  You know that.  You tell me not to use facts  because you want me  to go only on emotion.  Guess what?  I like facts.  I like facts.  You hide behind  the ones you like.  You cherry pick them.  I don't hide.  I don't cherry pick them.  Wait, wait.  Can I make a point?  Anytime you say,  guess what?  Whatever point you make  after that,  you sound like a remark.  It stinks.  You never sound brilliant  going, guess what?  And then making a point.  And Rosie... 
[01:04:30]  Believe it or not.  And Rosie says,  you just like the facts  that you like.  You just throw out  the facts that you like.  Well, that's exactly  what Rosie does.  She's thrown out  with that 9-11  conspiracy crap.  Those are facts  that she likes  that aren't facts.  You know,  it's all this speculation  and rumor  and conspiracy theory.  The facts  are the things  that Rosie doesn't like  so she doesn't accept them.  Oh, man.  You're helping out Elizabeth.  Well, I'm just  being reasonable here.  I just like 
[01:05:00]  how she just  is getting, you know,  schooled here.  You know what it is.  It's pent-up  sexual frustration  on Rosie's part.  That girl  is exactly Rosie's type,  by the way.  You see Rosie's wife,  whatever it is,  whatever you want to call her?  Kelly.  Yeah, she's like  an older version of her.  Yeah.  Rosie is looking  at that young nymph  just going,  God, do I want  a chunk of that.  Oh, do I want  a chunk of that.  She wants  what amounts  to a temporary  blonde goatee  is what she wants 
[01:05:30]  to do.  Are you saying  that Rosie wants  to give her  a real talking to?  Exactly.  Yeah, all right.  You cherry pick.  I don't hide.  I don't cherry pick.  Did I or did I  not give this panel  a list of facts?  And you know what?  Oh, my gosh.  We're going to be  right back  with Alicia Silverstone.  Yes.  No, no, no, we're not.  No, because we have  a lot more time.  This is where it gets great.  So they try to go  to commercial. 
[01:06:00]  There's a black woman  on the show.  I believe she was a guest,  a comic or something.  I don't know.  Just a film.  She looks like Star Jones.  Okay.  She's like the Star Jones  fill-in.  Yeah.  And she then  tried to go to commercial,  but obviously  it wasn't time  for a commercial  and Rosie wasn't  having it.  Rosie goes,  nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  She goes, nah, nah.  I got more to say.  Why would they not want this?  It's like everyone's  talking about  that dumb show.  No, you know what?  They wanted this  because not only 
[01:06:30]  did they not go  to commercial  because they could  just go to commercial  right there.  And I think that was  about the time  they would go to commercial  and Rosie was like,  nah, nah, nah.  And then they went  split screen.  Yeah, they went split screen.  The guy in the control room,  no, they wanted this yesterday.  Yep.  They've been waiting for this.  So they went split screen.  So you had Rosie on the left,  you had Elizabeth on the right  and they're just  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I also am a little suspect  because whenever stuff  like this really happens,  like the big blowouts  like this,  Barbara is mysteriously  not on the show that day. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  I don't think Barbara  likes the type of controversy  that goes on like this.  They both know  they shouldn't do it  in front of Barbara.  Right.  Because she's such  a powerful woman  in the media.  Barbara stinks.  She really does stink.  Hey, could you make it  about me  because I'm 70  and irrelevant.  People were criticizing  you for saying that  because it suggested  something, okay?  So I said,  look, take your opportunity now.  You have a show right now  to tell the world  what you really think.  I didn't want to take  my opportunity  to tell the world.  I wanted to know  what people like you,  but you are my friend  since September. 
[01:07:30]  Do you believe  that I think  our troops  are terrorists?  I do.  And you would not  even look me in the face  Elizabeth and say,  no Rosie,  I can understand  how people might have  thought that.  Why don't you take  this opportunity  like I'm six?  Because you are an adult  and I am certainly  not going to be  the person for you  to explain your thoughts.  They're your thoughts.  Defend your own  insinuations.  Elizabeth's got some issues.  That's a good point  that she made, though.  Yeah.  The fact that it's like,  you know,  you defend yourself.  You're the one that said  it's stupid. 
[01:08:00]  It's not her job.  Don't make Elizabeth  run to your defense.  I defend myself.  They're your own thoughts.  Right, but every time  I defend them,  Elizabeth,  it's poor little Elizabeth  that I'm picking on.  You know what?  Poor little Elizabeth  is not poor little Elizabeth.  That's right.  What do you think of that?  Poor little Elizabeth  is not poor little Elizabeth.  I don't know,  but how is she going to...  It's not poor little Elizabeth.  It's not poor little Elizabeth.  She's poor little Elizabeth.  You know what?  Poor little Elizabeth 
[01:08:30]  is not poor little Elizabeth.  That's right.  That's why I'm not going  to fight with you anymore  because it's absurd.  So for three weeks  you can say  all the Republican crap you want.  I'm not going to do it.  It's easier to fight  someone like Donald Trump,  isn't it?  Because he's obnoxious.  I've never fought him.  That's a...  from the audience.  I told a fact about him.  He didn't like this conversation.  I was in the middle  of this conversation.  I gave you an opportunity  to give me anything.  You don't have to give me.  I asked you a question.  I asked you a question.  You can't even answer it.  You can't even answer your own question.  Oh, Elizabeth. 
[01:09:00]  There's nothing better  than just listening  to this type of thing.  Absolutely.  Just two hens  going at it like that.  It's amazing.  And you're right.  We should just be shot  for even discussing this.  Not just for enjoying the audio.  That's fine.  I'm not even listening.  My father would be,  Ro, he's talking about the view.  I'm not even sitting here  going,  oh, she made a good point.  Oh, she made a good point.  I just love that  they're just going at  each other's throats.  But I'm thinking...  I'm enjoying that part of this.  I should be...  As I'm talking about this,  I'm realizing I'm going,  yeah, but Elizabeth is valid on...  And I just... 
[01:09:30]  If a hand came out of thin air  and slapped my face,  I wouldn't question it.  You'd know why.  I would completely understand.  I asked you if you believed  that I thought that...  You couldn't answer  your own question.  I don't believe  that your suggestion was right.  Every day since September,  I have told you  I support the truth.  I've done the same for you.  I asked you  if you believed  what the Republican pundits  were saying.  I said yes.  You said nothing  and that's cowardly.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  Nothing, Elizabeth.  Do not,  do not call me a coward  because number one,  I sit here every single day,  open my heart 
[01:10:00]  and tell people  exactly what I believe.  So do I, Elizabeth.  Do not call me a coward, Rosie.  It was cowardly yesterday.  It was not cowardly.  It was honest.  What is cowardly?  Is there no commercial  in the show?  Joy is,  she's amazing actually.  Is there no commercial?  They went long for him, man.  Stupid Rosie  trying to call her a coward  because she didn't  defend her properly?  Shut up.  Rosie's the one  questioning how  Khaled Sheikh Mohammed,  the number three...  Ow.  No,  asking a rhetorical question 
[01:10:30]  that you never answer yourself.  That is cowardly.  directing this show.  Let's go to commercial.  Let's go to commercial.  I need a drink of water.  Let's go to commercial.  Yeah, baby.  I need the baby.  The baby's fine.  Here's the thing.  Sherry Shepard has a CD.  It will make you laugh.  That's who was sitting in,  Sherry Shepard.  But the thing,  you see,  the thing is like  if Rosie makes certain statements  and Elizabeth is going to  like not defend her, 
[01:11:00]  I don't think that you can imply...  That one had to hurt.  That's just a taste.  They went on for like 10 minutes.  Let's say hi to Rick.  Rick,  you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up?  I got my period today  and I'm just wondering  what I should take, guys.  Grab yourself a Midol.  I'm bloated.  I'm not really feeling...  I got really bad cramps.  I got to get one of those warm...  What are they called? 
[01:11:30]  Get a hot water bottle  and put it on your tummy.  On your belly.  On your belly.  Are you bloating, sir?  On your lower abdomen.  If you're not bloating,  don't worry about the Midol.  Just take an Advil.  Right.  But if you're bloating,  take the Midol.  All right.  Thanks.  All right.  Good evening.  Hey, man.  What can I tell you?  It's something everyone's  talking about today.  It's fun to listen in  as two people self-destruct.  Rosie, by the way,  I love how she throws out,  I do support the troops.  No, she doesn't. 
[01:12:00]  I love the line where  I support the troops  and then every other word  out of your mouth  is something horrific  about the troops,  the military itself,  the leadership, everything.  Which you have a perfect right  to criticize the leadership  and how things are being run,  the administration.  But as far as the troops go,  you can't then say  you support the troops  when all you do  is talk about  how many Iraqi dead there are  and how our troops  are doing awful things  and bring up the Abu Ghraib 
[01:12:30]  and then you're not  supporting the troops.  And you don't have  to support the troops.  I mean, one of the great things  about, you know,  being American  is if you don't support the troops,  you can say it.  I think the troops think.  Then say that.  Just don't, like you said,  trash everything they're doing  and then go with the stupid,  the byline of,  well, I support the troops.  Because that's the big kicker.  If you say you don't support the troops,  then you're screwed.  Then forget about it.  But at least be honest  and say,  no, I don't support the troops.  She will always say  I support the troops  when obviously  everything she said  goes against that. 
[01:13:00]  I had Jim Norton say  that I support the troops,  but only the hunky ones.  How?  Let's say hi to Michael  in Brooklyn.  Michael.  Yeah, how you doing?  Hey.  The best part about  that whole argument thing  is seeing the video.  Elizabeth is pregnant,  so her knockers  are all swollen up.  Is that what you took away  from that entire exchange?  Her big pregnant knockers?  We're stupid guys.  Who are you kidding? 
[01:13:30]  I was like,  wow, look at those knockers.  Halfway through the argument,  she's going to fall over  like Adrian and Rocky 2  back up the feed.  Swollen knockers.  Nice.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show  on 92.3.  Free of them.  Hey, you're checking out  the Opie and Anthony Show.  Thank you for the support.  We love our listeners.  I have a handprint on my face.  Most of them, anyway. 
[01:14:00]  What, Jimmy?  I have a handprint on my face.  Oh, well.  You were smacked  for talking about The View.  Twice.  Not being a man.  Once forward,  once backhand.  Because a man  cannot be a true man  if he talks about The View.  You'll be showing off  your handprint  at the Stress Factory  this weekend.  Uh-huh.  That was better  than I could have done it.  Saturday sold out  tonight through Sunday.  And by the way,  happy birthday.  Thank you, Opie.  You're welcome.  It's birthday.  Okay.  We got a quickie  and then we're going to  try something brand new 
[01:14:30]  on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yup.  Oh, yeah.  We're going to bring in  Jared, the intern.  He is a creep.  We got to get into  what's going on  in that guy's head.  What a ghoul.  But first,  a quick story.  And there's no surprise  here, by the way.  None whatsoever.  I'll play it  and then we'll get  into a little discussion.  A new sex toy  called the iGasm  has the folks at Apple  Irate.  A British sex shop  created the device.  Irate.  This is what it does.  I bet.  It connects to MP3 players  and vibrates 
[01:15:00]  to stimulate  its user  to the rhythm  of the song.  The ad poster  for the sex toy  is the same style  as the iPod campaign.  A British paper  reports  iPod maker Apple  is threatening  to sue  if the ads  don't sue.  Of course you're going to.  How great is this?  But this is what  we do as humans.  All new technology  has to be used  for sex.  Has to be used  for sex.  Some type  of sexual  pleasure.  I heard this story  this morning  and I'm like  well it's about time  you know. 
[01:15:30]  The iPod's been around  long enough  where someone  had to figure out  how to use it  for sex.  Was it just  some kind of  vibrator  that goes  to the music?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So you plug it in  and plug it in  and then  just turn it on.  I finally went  with the electric  toothbrush.  Oh really?  Finally went  with the electric  toothbrush.  Makes brushing  your teeth  much easier, right?  And it comes  with an attachment.  A little plastic  like cover  for the bristles.  Yeah.  And I'm thinking  to myself 
[01:16:00]  now why  did they  include that  in the packaging?  Sanitary reasons?  Yeah, but  we've all had  toothbrushes obviously.  Have you ever  had a cover  for your regular  toothbrush?  Never.  It just sits  out in the open.  And then I got  to thinking.  I'm like see  they even know  that their product  could be used  for sex.  Cover up the bristles  with this plastic  thing and you're  good to go.  If you're too  poor to have  two different  electric toothbrushes  you could use  the same  electric toothbrush. 
[01:16:30]  That's a little  But that's the  only reason  they give you  the cover.  That's a little  Because this thing  is like a  mini vibrator.  But it gets  back to the  discussion.  Everything that  is invented  eventually we  try to figure  out how to  use it for  sex.  For sex or  self-pleasure  or whatever.  Right?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  When the  internet happened  you know Bill  Gates I remember  I was listening  to one of his  books on tape  Bill Gates  talking about  the future  and the internet  and how you'll 
[01:17:00]  be conferencing  and video  conferencing  and if you  have a hobby  and you live  in Seattle  well a person  in New York  that has the  same hobby  you guys will  be able to  communicate  about your  hobby  whether it's  like building  ships in a  bottle  or macrame  and of  course  no  it was all  about nude  pictures  if you're into  a dog fetish  and you live  in Seattle  and someone  in New York  is also into  a dog fetish  well you can  hook up 
[01:17:30]  it really was  the beginning  of it  you know  now obviously  a lot of  information on  the internet  you'll look up  whatever you want  you get news  you get videos  of other things  but at the  beginning it  truly was  just porn  I can recall  sitting for  hours on end  until I fell  asleep in front  of the computer  just perusing  pornography  on the internet  that was pretty  much it  and it would  take so long  for the picture  to scroll down  to download 
[01:18:00]  it would be  like a peep show  first you'd see  the hair  and then the  eyeballs  and the nose  and you're  going down  and going  okay  come on  download  and then you're  like oh  that's nice  alright next  when exactly  was it like  that all of a sudden  the internet  was like  I can't remember  not having it  in my life  it was there  it was early  mid 90s  I remember  at BAB  they were talking  about the internet  and as far as  it pertained  to like  bands 
[01:18:30]  and they're like  let's say  you're a fan  of Jimmy Buffett  this is how  it was explained  to me at first  like  you could go  online  and get all  the lyrics  of every  Jimmy Buffett  song  stop it  I'm like  wow  no kidding  and then  you could also  talk to  Jimmy Buffett  fans  no way  and that was  like early 90s  that was like  92  that's when I  started  around 92  I guess  wow that is early  yeah  but then it really  hit around 94  ish  right  when we were  up in Boston  yeah 
[01:19:00]  yeah  I realized  that's it though  94  that's  you know  come on  my mother bought a  gateway  the gateway  computer  that was the  big thing  for the family  was the gateway  we had to see  prompt to get on  and I went and  downloaded this  sex video  it was like a  brief one  of course you did  but I didn't know  how to hide it  or how to right click  and put it somewhere  so I never knew  where it went  and I just  it obviously  wound up my  parents computer  somewhere  and I never knew  how to find it  so there was  a very inappropriate 
[01:19:30]  piece of footage  on my parents  computer somewhere  and then the computer  caught a virus  and my sister's  boyfriend at the  time had to fix it  oh you know  he found it  of course he did  that was the  real tricky part  about computing  early on too  most people  didn't know  the ins and outs  and the technical  things or how to  get rid of things  and whatever  so you would  download all  this pornography  and it would just  be residing  somewhere on your  computer and you  had no clue  what to do with it  you thought because  you clicked the  window shut  that it was gone  but you downloaded 
[01:20:00]  it so you just  have these giant  libraries of porno  sitting on your  computers  a little bit more  savvy now  the good old days  and the paranoia  sets in  you go in your  basement with all  sorts of tools  and just start  just start pounding  the computer  wrenches  wrenches  and mallets  like I don't think  you should use that  down there  got some channel  locks  I'm building a  go-kart  go away  power saws  and freaking  whatever it took 
[01:20:30]  then one of your  dopey friends  will tell you  look  even if you just  destroy the whole  computer  they can still  get the hard drive  it's still there  so then you have  to get the hard drive  and drills  can't still be there  I broke my monitor  you can't see it  no you dummy  you're down in the  basement like a  serial killer  dismembering a body  but it's your  computer  I found that the  best way to keep  the FBI from  finding things  is I empty my  recycle bin  oh very good  Jimmy  wow  very very  hear that little 
[01:21:00]  crumple sound  I know you're  safe  do you know  whenever I hear  that I giggle  a little  I am such a  complete dork  that I hear like  and I'm like  I just kind of  think it's cute  it's crumpling  paper and I know  there's no paper  in there  I really do  I don't know  why I kind of  like that  I hate the  any computer  sounds I despise  yeah  it's not  you're talking  you're down  in the basement  taking apart  your computer  like you're  working over  a lobster  ripping it apart 
[01:21:30]  you gotta wear  a bib  getting any  films dribbling  on your chest  getting to the  inside of the  thing  parts all over  the basement  peeling it apart  you need a  nutcracker  parts all over  the basement  your hair  is skew  you're sweating  you hear footsteps  at the top  of the stairs  you know  any moment  they're coming  down  and see what's  going on  need to have  one of those  little baby wipes  when you're done  clean your hands  off with  it's just a mess  pouring all sorts  of like just  condiments on the 
[01:22:00]  computer  the old days  I remember once  we were  we were in  we were doing  radio in Boston  and I had driven  down for the  weekend like I  usually did  and I went  over my brother's  house and my  brother had like a  Mac and he  was hooked up  to AOL and  just you could  download porn  it was great  you could trade  for pictures with  people and I  was doing that  until I realized  oh my god  it's like 7 in  the morning and I 
[01:22:30]  have to do a show  in Boston and I  was still in New  York  I was just looking  at so much porn  all overnight and  everything my  brother had gone  to bed and I'm  just sitting there  porn porn porn  download one more  picture one more  one more and then  I realized I got to  go up now drive to  Boston and do a  radio show but I  couldn't get I  couldn't it was so  new this whole  porno thing on the  computer that I just  couldn't stop yeah  couldn't stop hey 
[01:23:00]  you got some Jimmy I'm  sorry no no no it's  okay I was only  thinking like you're  like you zone out  sometimes it's like a  high in a way because  you're looking and all  of a sudden you're  like what happened  where did my night  go and then the  front of my shirt it  looks like somebody  somebody shot shot  me with a glue gun  I'm like what  happened  secret message to  opi's taint at this  time we don't know  so stop  secret message  instant feedback  secret messages  someone on their  cell phone the 
[01:23:30]  toothbrush covers for  travel bud and he  wrote bud oh so  before the electric  toothbrush we just  we we traveled with  our regular toothbrushes  without without the  cover you put it in a  plastic bag or  something don't be  naive put a bag on  it people that invent  these new products and  work for these  companies I I I will  almost guarantee they  have meetings behind  closed doors like all  right what kind of  what kind of thing can  we add to this to make  it useful for sex yeah  they ever go down a 
[01:24:00]  deodorant aisle oh yeah  you think they're in  those shapes because  there's an artist working  for the company some of  them are shaped like  bullets they're they're  shaped of very uh very  uh interestingly yeah  in a very familiar  fashion mm-hmm that's  just smuggle that's all  tickle remember tickle  deodorant that's all  called a tickle and it  was shaped exactly like a  male and the male  anatomy that's what I'm  saying look at the look 
[01:24:30]  at the deodorants I mean  these companies know  exactly what they're doing  there's the the number one  used for the product and  then they try to figure  out all right is there  any way this could be  used for sex if so use  let's take advantage of  that yeah of course was  it I don't care what my  deodorant is shaped like  as long as my mouthwash  isn't shaped like that  yeah you got to do  something to the  container before it  squirts mouthwash in  your mouth and you want  to get mouthwash in your  hair what happened hey 
[01:25:00]  let's say hi to Jeff in  Jersey Jeff what's up  hey good morning hey  hey Jeff I can  appreciate Anthony's  feeling about AOL  the new site that's like  YouTube and it's just  as active yeah yeah  basically what he's  trying to say finding new  porn sites is like  finding the the internet  all over again yeah  got it thank you sir  hey there's the there's  the tickle that's what  yep that was tickle you 
[01:25:30]  think that was by  accident the shape of the  tickle uh deodorant I  don't know if it's  necessarily built like a  guy at all I mean when  you look well you can't  like make it completely  like a guy I mean like  that's sitting on the  shelves it looks like a  guy if you got trying to  make it kind of subtle yeah  it looks like a guy if  you were standing there in  front of a table and uh  things were looking  normal and a horse just  stepped in the middle of  yeah hey uh Frank in  Westchester Frank what's 
[01:26:00]  up yeah what's up guys  how you doing good um  yeah I work for one of  those toothbrush companies  I do lunch and learns  every day and what you do  what lunch and learns what  is that what's that five  year old boy term you meet  with Dennis you talk about  your toothbrush and you know  they decide either they like  it or they don't are you a  toothbrush salesman what's  that are you a toothbrush  salesman yeah I am whatever  happened to that rubber  thing at the end that kind 
[01:26:30]  of went away yeah you mean  the thing that uh does your  gums yeah that kind of went  away didn't it it was all  the rage for a while it was  very hard to put your  toothbrush in the toothbrush  holder with that stupid  rubber nipple on it it was  awful it's an awful nipple  and it was disgusting I  remember only adults had that  the adult toothbrush like your  parents had that stupid  toothbrush you just look at  that thing and go ew yeah  because if you used it the  point would last for a while  you might pick your gums once  with it and all of a sudden it  was like a little like a  little ankle on the end of 
[01:27:00]  your toothbrush yeah you didn't  need that and then you got the  people that don't clean it  properly so you see a little  piece of shrimp little  still hanging from it little  gack is on there little  piece of shrimp little  spinach little piece of celery  stalk uh so Frank what did you  want to be when you were  growing up yeah I'm sure you  didn't you know start out  wanting to be a toothbrush  salesman no I mean you start  out just going into sales and  no no no seriously like when  you were a kid what did you 
[01:27:30]  want to be when you when you  grew up we like finding out  this stuff a fireman or  something oh how many firemen  and astronauts were gone I wish  I worked for a toothbrush company  and did lunch and learns lunch and  learn never never fails though  every time I do one of them  there's always one perv in the  group you know it's always a  woman who's laughing and  giggling and it's kind of  embarrassing at first because  you know when you start out  you're like you know what's 
[01:28:00]  going on but after a while you  just you're you're looking for  the one in the group that's  going to start laughing and  they're just pinned as the  perv well sir do you think that  maybe they have the covers on  them like that because it's a  $90 toothbrush that's another  reason to you don't want to  break is a regular toothbrush is  $1.78 as opposed to the $90  piece of electronics you're  carrying around with you if I do  want to cover the tip of it  yeah  hey if you guys want some free  toothbrush  thanks for coming  all right great  I asked a valid question he  just blew it at me  Anita what's up 
[01:28:30]  Anita will set us straight  Anita Long Island what's up  come on Anita  oh she could have started  something nice  what'd she say  they're shaped like that  because you know nature  knows what it's doing or  something like that and then  it could have led to women  finally admit and maybe they  could talk about some of the  other stuff they're using to  you know around the house  yes  I just remember the stuff I  used to read like in penthouse  forum with the women and the  dryer they'd put an uneven 
[01:29:00]  load like sneakers stuff like  that in the dryer like shack  sneakers  and they'd go shacks  sneakers  yeah  the size queen  it's the size of the shoe  you throw in the dryer  the dryer's walking around the  laundry room going through  walls  you're not getting little  billy's fur sneakers  you're getting shacks  off of  off uh  from the nba store  and then they would position  themselves by the corner  yeah  of the uh  of the dryer 
[01:29:30]  and just let the dryer do all  the work  and uh  that's supposed to work  because you get the the dryer's  like going  kind of giving the old  pile driver thing  you know  and uh  i i've heard i've heard of  that  uh the electric toothbrush  the uh shower massage  yeah see  it's a big one  yeah  all right  uh after the break we're  gonna bring in jared  he's gonna interview somebody  uh live on the show  we got a nice twist on the  interview we're trying out

[01:40:30]  at the visor  of the helmets  yeah  and when they  both strap the  helmets on their  faces will be mere  inches apart  and they must  conduct the  interview uncomfortably  close you know  when someone invades  your personal space  yeah you get that  feeling like oh  god and you have  to kind of step  back well in  this case uh  no one's gonna  be able to  step back  there is no  pulling back  because if you  step back that  person's face is  coming right with  you that's right  uncomfortably  close interview 
[01:41:00]  i tend to like to  stand about 18-20  inches away from  people i talk to  ah patty  shut up  he does  all right  why don't we uh  why don't we get  the helmets on uh  jared and uh  stalker patty  yeah stand up  get the helmets on  because you're not  really gonna be able  to turn your heads  very well  they're bicycle uh  helmets right  so they got the  straps and everything  all right jared  yeah you got a big  head huh  well you got to put

[01:42:00]  bike helmet they're a  mere eight inches uh  from each other's uh  mouths look at patty's  uncomfortable body  language yeah she  folds her arms and  jared can't look at  her this is really  uncomfortable she's  pulling at her clothes  you're doing everything  that shows you're very  uncomfortable patty  all right  jared's just making  this disgusted face  you both look very  silly by the way  yeah to add that in  they aren't like close 
[01:42:30]  enough you don't think  they're close enough  i understand but none  of them here's what i  don't like and this is  where they're both  cheating i want you  both can you put your  head straight a little  bit yeah straight  there you go  straighten your heads  out  all right i think they  might need to be a little  closer yes step closer  feet wise touch toes  yeah hey you big lug  hey do we have a rope or  something we can tie around  them no or something no  yeah yeah tape them up i'm  thinking just tape the uh  yeah we we have to  improvise on the spot tape

[01:48:00]  now she's so close  she's covering her own mouth  because she knows her breath might  patty face him  face him  talk right into him  look at his face  we're gonna make you get even closer  if you don't play along here  all right  go ahead jared  six and seven  explain how you came to live  underneath the stairs of wnew  um  i was gonna take part in a radio contest  that the people i was staying with objected to  and i went ahead and did it anyway  against their wishes  so they threw  wait can i

[01:49:00]  and hang out  i'm not used to that  so i wanted to have a roof full for my head  you're not facing  you're not facing the interviewer  you're not  face and turn your head  don't make  turn your head  and look directly at  jared's face  yeah carefully turn her head  there you go  he's now holding  patty turn your head to the right  all right  is this  there you go  right there  i'll talk  can they see well  yeah  they're like a mere two inches  from each other's lips at this point  as the interview continues  although the paper is in the way  yeah paper's in the way there jared  jared 
[01:49:30]  what are you pulling back  what are you doing  here pull the  put the paper down jared  so the pal talkers can see you  all right there you go  patty continue uh answering  so i figured a safe place  would be like on the couch  right next to the studio  so i would be safe  for a few days  until i figured out what to do  so you were living under the stairs  for a while  well not for a while  with your pet rabbit  about a week  and then after that  i found a  some kind of shelter  all right jared  or would you have preferred to live  in a van down by the river 
[01:50:00]  i didn't know  of any vans  down by the river  of course she doesn't  you know patty  one of the funniest moments  right at him  in anthony history  involved you getting thrown  out of wnew  and then getting your wig  repossessed in the middle  of the street  um what was going through  your bald head at the time  i have to go to work  uh my dignity  but i got to keep the wig  anyway  he gave it to me back  patty why are you looking  away  she keeps looking 
[01:50:30]  yeah patty  you're not gonna kiss  each other  it's your job  turn their heads  right toward each other  oh my god  jesus  kenny's like ready to  bang their heads together  oh my god  the old cop days  are coming back  yeah  no ken  what are you doing  you're two skills talk  kenny's having a flashback  put your head up  patty  up  yeah just talk  you're not kissing  are you a little too close  there patty you think  you haven't been this close  to a guy's face  no  you haven't been this close  to a guy's face before  no  jared what's the most 
[01:51:00]  what's the most  and be honest  what's the most unpleasant  part of this interview  um standing right next to her  why  uh  it's just  really uncomfortable  you're fogging up her glasses  by the way  what's uh  what's jared's breath  uh like patty  i don't know  i never smelled  one's breath  before like  i don't know  all right  normal i guess  head up patty  head up  head up  not to the side  get her chin up there 
[01:51:30]  uh kenny  all right next question  there jared  oh god  all right  patty um  if the studio was on fire  and you had to choose  between saving  opie anthony or jim  who would it be  i would save everybody  you can't dummy  you can't  it's a choice  you have to choose one  i can't do that  everybody's important  money  answer the question  answer the question  hypothetical  or we make you kiss  superhero  you better say somebody  because uh 
[01:52:00]  if you don't  choose one of the three patty  one of the three  but what about the other two  they'll understand  we die  i could only say  one person  anthony and jimmy  will understand  that's it  one person  i'd rather be dead  than oh you  all right  i'll bet i just do  eeny meeny miny moe  well i gotta finish that  yeah come on  do it like we used to do  when we were kids  the other two are gonna  get out somehow  definitely  and they'll probably be  right behind me 
[01:52:30]  uh  i would take the  lightest one out of the  three  which one is that patty  i don't know  the easiest one to  grab and  whatever  can't you commit to  anything  patty patty  it's ob  anthony  or jim  it's as simple as that  all right  um  i would take  uh  the smallest person  name a name  you got three choices  okay  i would grab 
[01:53:00]  i would think  the easiest person  to grab  would probably  be jimmy  because the other two  won't let me near them  and  they'll be running out  right behind me  i'll blaze a trail  behind me  so they can follow  bravo to patty  and i'll blaze a trail  so they can follow me  all right  uh jerry what about  uh  question nine  question nine  um  patty it seems like  you'll do anything  for money  you've had your head  shaved  you've rolled around  naked in mousetraps 
[01:53:30]  and with the  crusty clown mask  how much  does opie and anthony  have to finally  shell out  for you to have sex  oh  first of all  i don't want  to have sex  why  slacks  well because  i don't want  the problems  that could occur  like what  you're not going  to get knocked up  so uh  yeah  and they have condoms  if you're worried  about stds  well i don't want  aids or anything

[02:00:30]  uncomfortably  close interview  worked pretty well  we're gonna  fine tune it  send it back  to the institute  do some research  see how it worked out  check our readings  also  maybe the message boards  could figure out  who they want  Jared  to interview next  Jared was good  any one of the show  members  except for  like the big A's  and the rest of them  okay  so patty  was that a good kiss  did you like that  it was an uncomfortable  alright listen  we gotta take a break  the message boards  will decide 
[02:01:00]  who Jared  interviews next  okay  when we get back  Dr. Ian Smith  and Pat from Monaki  we're doing a little  intervention today  we'll do that next  it's Opie and Anthony  it's the Opie and Anthony show  92.3  free FM  free FM  yeah running out of show  you're checking out  Opie and Anthony  little Jimmy Norton  Tom just poked his head in  he wants to see us  after the show  yes  we have a meeting  what is that about  what is that about 
[02:01:30]  I don't know  I have a quick question  real quick before we go  what  what are you guys arguing  about off there  Sam and Eric  what's going on  yeah there was an argument  going on between Sam and Eric  and of course  Eric was losing miserably  what was happening  no he just comes over  and starts videotaping me  randomly  no matter what I'm doing  all of a sudden I turn around  and he's just standing there  with a camera  B-roll  yeah  alright we got Dr. Ian Smith  in studio  running out of show  speaking of B-Rock  you got that bet  $500  you handed it over to E-Rock 
[02:02:00]  he has to lose 20 pounds  by what date there E-Rock  June 28th  June 28th  he's down 5 pounds so far  so far so good  he's still got a lot of time  yeah  he said more than that  how much are down E-Rock  what  this morning I weighed  I was like 206  so what does that mean  so about 8 pounds  about 8 pounds  8 pounds  he's not giving that $500 back  he don't want to  but listen I told him  I got to sweeten the offer  I got a new thing happening  you ready for this  yeah  a national magazine came to me  and said  you got somebody  who's been on Fat Smash 
[02:02:30]  who we could feature  I said  oh please feature E-Rock  is it Idiot's Digest  I said  no no no no  Down Syndrome monthly  I said no  I got this guy on O&A  who I gave him $500  to lose this weight  you know  they said we'll feature him  we'll do a big blow up  I said but you know what  I don't know if this guy  can do it  blow up  I don't know if this guy  can really do it  so I said you know what  I'm going to open it up  to the O&A past  because you know what  you're not going to give E-Rock  the spotlight  well I'll give him the spotlight 
[02:03:00]  but the show shouldn't lose  because of him  if he's going to do it  great  if not  we need to have a backup  so the O&A past  we've lost all this weight  on Fat Smash  let me know  come on  alright  well  so E-Rock's got the bet  with Ian  from Celebrity Fit Club  by the way  great episode  with Dustin Diamond  and Harvey losing his mind  I wish Harvey  would have got up  and punched him though  would have been correct  too much to lose  way too much to lose  do you think Harvey  could really give him a beating  because Dustin Diamond  did take some kind of martial arts  let me tell you something 
[02:03:30]  Harvey would have wiped  the freaking scale  that's what I said  it's like  I don't care what martial arts  Dustin Diamond knows  he's Dustin Diamond  and this guy  is an animal marine  like the guy would have  killed him  he trained you for a record  what you didn't see  by the way  because it's  by the way  if you want to  be up to date  just go look at the video  you don't even have to  go to V Spot  go to V Spot  oh V Spot  it's amazing  because Dustin Diamond  is a complete ass  he's not really doing the show  he's just there  to get a little camera time  and a huge explosion  last week  and part 2 is this week 
[02:04:00]  right  part 2 is this week  so what did we  what did we miss  I'm sorry  what you didn't see  was that when  he was talking on that smack  I challenge you  to physical combat  when Harvey starts getting up  and he's going to jump  over the table  he's into his mic  saying to the producers  in the back  somebody better come out here  somebody better come out here  he totally wussed  oh did he  oh completely  if he lays a hand on me  I'm going to call my lawyer  I'm going to call my lawyer  ew  but that was Dustin Diamond  yeah you didn't see  so why didn't you show that  well I don't cut the show  what's wrong with VH1  I don't cut the show  why wouldn't they show that  expose him for the phony he is 
[02:04:30]  for the fraud he is  so where's that clip  oh VH1 stinks  go find another gig  that guy's got to work  opi  Jesus  that's the stuff  people want to see  I know  that's like the  the Rosie Elizabeth fight  that happened yesterday  if that was pre-taped  they would cut it down  to nothing  keep it safe  but it was live  so that's the part  that pisses me off  but I will say  so Dustin Diamond  was being a puss  what  wait till the season finale  oh good  somebody else goes after him  I'm not going to say who  someone else goes 
[02:05:00]  I mean like this close  and we all leave  this whole place  no it's great  wow  the last episode  of Celebrity Fit Club  I'm kind of hooked  because my pal's on it  it was great to see  Marsha Brady  being an alcoholic  wow really  oh yeah man  Marsha knows how to chug  VH1 had no problem  showing that there  Dr. Ian Smith  that mean looking  I've never  I've seen you on this show  you've never seen Harvey  no  he looks like  he'd kill you 
[02:05:30]  he looks like the guy  that did the Coco Casa commercials  but he's in much better shape  look at him  look at him  man  he's great  he's great  I tell you  he almost went over  I was sitting there laughing  because I heard this back and forth  then when I looked up  Harvey is leaning  I was like  holy cow  the psychologist is like  Dr. Ian get over here  help stop him from  jumping over the table  it was outrageous  I'm not jumping into this  then Dustin Diamond  he threatens Ant  Ant's like 2 feet tall  100 pounds  but a funny guy  I don't know  Dustin Diamond  he made short work  of Horschach  funny guy 
[02:06:00]  you think that's funny  no your line was funny  no no  Ant  it was a mess  it was a mess  and I have no doubt  you can scrap  oh we don't even go there  I told those guys  in the beginning of the show  listen guys  let me just be the nice doctor  you don't want to take me to  your features changed a little bit  to where I came from  oh man  you don't want to take me  to where I came from  are you a scrappy  oh yeah  I would mess with this guy  no way  he's in perfect physical condition  so it doesn't surprise  anyway 
[02:06:30]  really fast  because Ant's in love  with Marsha Brady  it used to be back in the day  they're doing this  dance competition  like a dance marathon  was there a fitness thing  they had to do this week  wow there Dr. Ian Smith  I don't do the fitness side  a lot of cardio  is going to be burned  doing the Foxtrot  that guy's making a living  over here  oh my god  we're going to get you  off that dumb show  I have no show  next season  if you don't see Dr. Ian  on next season  Slopey Fit Club  thanks to O  it's to OB 
[02:07:00]  so listen  so Marsha Brady  before they do this  dance marathon  she's at the bar  just slamming back  shots of vodka  was it vodka  not one either  I think it was two  maybe three  they showed us  slamming them back  wouldn't you also  be drinking  if some radio host  somewhere  would just  not stop calling you  Marsha Brady  can I tell you something  though  she's lost  here's the key  even though she's drinking  this is what the point  to Dustin was  she's lost 28 pounds  in 65 days on fat  so her liver fell out 
[02:07:30]  probably  that's the liquid diet  you know what I mean  Maureen if you're listening  I love you baby  oh whatever  you don't have to say that  yeah she has listened  to this crap  it's implied  she was my favorite  Brady girl  she knows the  just gang wars  Robert Reed  Robert Reed  Robert Reed lost  a lot of ways  beat his record  oh this clip is amazing  go to V-Spot  check it out  but Dustin Dyer  just the biggest  he really is mad  this guy  oh my goodness  Harvey  could rip him apart 
[02:08:00]  man  that's why I'm trying  to hold him back  I'm like Harvey  don't  this guy's gonna  his lawyer's gonna  sue you  you'll be in jail  you know whatever  alright we're running  out of show  we got Pat from  Menachie in studio  we got to know him  a little bit more  the other day  he was in love  Dr. Ian Smith  back in December  back in December  she left right  yeah  she went  Pat drove her  to the bus stop  and she went  on her merry way  took the bus  back to wherever  she came from  at the time  Pat was growing  in his hair  and he was losing weight 
[02:08:30]  he was feeling good  about himself  since then  he has  gone back  to shaving  his head  and all the weight  he did lose  he gained back  and then some  he gained about  50 pounds  since December  right  is that accurate  50 pounds  since December  yes  I believe so  he's up to  340  yes  and he's a  competitive eater  ok but that guy  what's that guy  Kuyashiki  what is it  oh Kobayashi  that guy's a  competitive eater  who's the best  in the world  and he has abs  yeah the guy's abs
