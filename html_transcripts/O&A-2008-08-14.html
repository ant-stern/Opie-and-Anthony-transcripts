<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with an abrupt cut from a seemingly unrelated song to a Discovery Channel clip showcasing a man with a severe facial tumor, prompting crude jokes from Opie, Anthony, and Bob Kelly.  The main focus then shifted to a discussion about relationships and dating, featuring guests Dr. Victoria Zidrock and comedian Patrice O’Neal.  Their debate was highly sexually charged and vulgar, with O’Neal advocating for a primal, instinctual male perspective on relationships, contrasting sharply with Dr. Zidrock’s emphasis on emotional connection and communication.  The discussion included offensive jokes about sex and gender roles, infidelity, diverse sexual preferences, and power dynamics between men and women.  Comedian TJ Miller briefly appeared, adding to the comedic interjections already provided by Bob Kelly. The segment concluded with continued heated debate and sexually explicit remarks.

This transitioned into a discussion about a book promoting techniques for men to achieve sexual success, which was mocked by the hosts.  A recurring, vulgar rating system for women's attractiveness (1-30, with subcategories like "ugly bitches" and "beautiful bitches") was employed, with Dr. Zidrock becoming a target of this rating system. The conversation rapidly devolved into increasingly graphic and sexually explicit descriptions of sexual acts and preferences, often involving degrading scenarios. Patrice O'Neal continued to be a prominent voice, delivering most of the offensive and provocative content.  The conversation took an unexpected turn when Dr. Zidrock, nearly nude in the studio, offered to perform a sexual act with Eastside Dave, a caller.  After initial agreement, Eastside Dave's wife's call led to his withdrawal.  The segment concluded with attempts to persuade someone to engage in the sexual act, culminating in Eastside Dave attempting to use a strap-on dildo, resulting in discomfort and an anticlimactic end.

The show then moved to a discussion about a bizarre incident involving a black dildo and a show staff member, Dave.  This led to a graphic discussion about body hair and sexual acts, punctuated by  Patrice O’Neal's contributions.  After promoting Ron and Fez's radio show, the hosts discussed Patrice’s potential for writing a sex advice book, even suggesting a collaborative project with Dr. Zidrock, with a Bukkake party as a reward for 10,000 book sales.  Comedian Jim Jefferies joined, sharing a personal anecdote about childhood molestation and subsequent conflict with his mother.  This was followed by a humorous incident involving Jefferies’ severe banana phobia, which the hosts exploited, resulting in Jefferies temporarily leaving the studio.  Upon his return,  Louie C.K. called in to discuss the cancellation of his HBO show, *Lucky Louie*, alongside in-studio guest Rick Shapiro.  The conversation detailed the cancellation despite a passionate fanbase and seemingly good ratings, speculating about the show's explicit content and controversial nature.  The segment ended with continued banter about the cancellation and promotion of various projects and individuals.


A subsequent segment featured further conversation with Louie C.K. about *Lucky Louie*, including on-screen arguments with Pamela Adlon, offensive language, and audience reaction to Rick Shapiro’s nude appearance on a segment about sex with elderly people. Louie C.K. also mentioned past hustling experiences. This was followed by a lengthy interview with comedian Pat Cooper, who recounted numerous anecdotes, often using highly offensive language, about his career, relationships, encounters with celebrities (Joe DiMaggio and Frank Sinatra), and his views on aging.  He discussed his father's death, health issues (including erectile dysfunction), and interactions with mobsters. The hosts occasionally interjected.

Later, a caller asked Pat Cooper about his Las Vegas experiences.  Cooper, using profanity, described the shift from generous casinos to a points-based system, recounting anecdotes about high-roller treatment and his refusal to partner in a Vegas comedy club. He then discussed his relationship with his grandchildren and preference for a quiet life.  The conversation then shifted to the "Pod Talk Monday" segment about hypothetical combat with primordial dwarfs.  Comedian Doug Stanhope joined, and the discussion veered into graphic descriptions of pornography, child pornography, entrapment in online sting operations, and various forms of body modification, with frequent vulgar and offensive language.  Callers contributed their experiences, escalating the explicit nature. The conversation included a purported Chuck Palahniuk story about a candle wax incident.

The show continued with explicit and graphic discussions about male and female anatomy, sexual acts, and unusual sexual fetishes, referencing various pornography websites, including *meatspin.com* and *fingerslam.com*.  A caller, Ken from Westchester, detailed his experience with urethra dilation.  Doug Stanhope's Showtime special was briefly discussed. Anthony revealed a recent breakup and visit to a lesbian bar. Comedian Brian Regan appeared as a guest, and the hosts playfully interacted with him.  The conversation shifted frequently between explicit sexual topics and unrelated tangents, including Anthony’s baby diaper mustache.

A final segment featuring Brian Regan began with a discussion about working at a butterfly pavilion and included a humorous anecdote. A caller referenced an awkward moment involving Regan, Joey Ramone, and two Dominics.  The hosts discussed their appearances on David Letterman, contrasting their one-time appearance with Regan's numerous appearances and discussed Opie's recent engagement.  Callers shared anecdotes about Regan's stand-up, and Regan discussed his act and his children's reactions to his comedy.  The conversation shifted to an eye doctor appointment and the possibility of Regan opening for Hannah Montana.  The segment concluded with rapid-fire comedic radio ads with suggestive and offensive language, featuring bands like Motley Crue and Foghat, and promotional announcements for other comedians, including Patrice O'Neal, Rich Vos, Bill Burr, Louis C.K., Robert Kelly, and Colin Quinn, culminating in a self-promotional closing segment by the hosts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Life is so strange  When you don't know  How can you tell  Where you're going to  You can't be sure  Of any situation  Something could change  And then you won't know 
[00:00:30]  Where do we go from here  It seems so all too near  Just as far beyond  As I can see  I still don't know  What this all means to me 
[00:01:00]  I have nowhere to go  I don't know what to do  And I don't even know  The time of day  I guess it doesn't matter  Anyway  Life is so strange  Destination I know  When you don't know  Your destination  Something could change  It's unknown  And then you won't know 
[00:01:30]  Destination I know  Life is so strange  Destination I know  When you don't know  Your destination  Something could change  It's unknown  And then you won't know  Destination I know  When will my time come

[00:02:30]  It's unknown  And then you won't know  Destination I know  Life is so strange  Destination I know  When you don't know  Your destination  Something could change  It's unknown  And then you won't know  Destination I know  Life is so strange 
[00:03:00]  Life is so strange  Life is so strange  Life is so strange  Life is so strange  Life is so strange  Life is so strange  Life is so strange  Life is so strange  Life is so strange  Life is so strange  Life is so strange 
[00:03:30]  Life is so strange  Let us go astray. 
[00:04:00]  Let us go astray. 
[00:04:30]  Let us go astray. 
[00:05:00]  Let us go astray. 
[00:05:30]  Can you guys come in like an hour early and just find some shit?  We do.  Okay, is that it?  What is it?  It's just a guy on Discovery Channel.  Ready?  Yes.  It's just audio or it's video?  No, it's good.  It's just somebody going to puke, right?  No, Bob.  Will you relax?  Is it the guy with the moles on his face?  No, moles.  Opie, Opie, can we just stop before you play it?  Opie, I want you to go home and...  Shut up, Bob. 
[00:06:00]  You sing your sentences when you lie.  I hate that you got me.  Is that his tell?  Yeah, he goes, Bob, oh no.  It's pretty good.  Bob is one of the only people to figure out my tell.  I hate you for that.  It's pretty good.  And I forgot you know that.  I got to fix it.  I never did that.  Can we please put music behind Opie's lying?  No.  Honey, I didn't cheat on you.  Bob, just check this out.  I don't ever happen.  Bob, check this out, really.  All right, Lisbon, Portugal, so you know it's going to suck.  It's UFOs.  Buddy, UFO, you jackass. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, you'll see.  You don't have an astray.  He's waking up.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no big deal.  Yeah, this don't...  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, this don't bug me.  That'll help.  That water'll help.  So when I wake up, I wash my face.  And then I kill myself.  Oh, God.  Yeah, that don't bug me.  That's the tumors on his face.  Yeah, I don't have a problem with this shit.  Oh, my God.  Then I cut a piece off of my face.  I put it with my eggs.  I wonder if he actually combs his hair. 
[00:07:00]  Because I start dribbling.  Why bother?  Did it look like he was cut a piece of his face off?  Look at his lips.  Sometimes the veins start to cut.  Look at that lip.  Jose struggles with the simplest of day-to-day thoughts.  Does he rub cheese on it so it smells bad?  It looks like a madam from Whelan Flowers.  Would you bite that?  Imagine biting that, though.  Jose has close-knit friends and family.  I want to eat.  His sister Gita and her daughter, nine-year-old Rafaela,  she subjects her daughter to their food.  He's normal. 
[00:07:30]  He has a friend.  He's like football.  He's like talk with friends.  He is like a football.  Don't pick it.  Gita juggles running her hairdressers with cooking and cleaning.  I drink after breakfast, too.  Last bottle of wine on the table.  God, this whole family's got to be skinny.  How do you possibly eat around this thing?  No way to eat.  It's a great diet.  I have an uncle with fucking diarrhea for a face. 
[00:08:00]  Not a pound overweight, are you?  Diarrhea.  Is his mouth on the left side right there?  No, he doesn't.  I don't know.  He's just shoving it and stuff, hoping to find some mouth.  He's going to stick his head out the window and birds are going to land on it and shit on it.  Since he was a teenager, Jose has been losing his face to this life-threatening tumor.  When is it going to be life-threatening?  That's great.  It's still in the life-threatening stage.  That's amazing.  Get your head out of the window, you fucking selfish asshole.  Really?  There's people out there. 
[00:08:30]  People walk by.  Human beings are outside.  You don't deserve fresh air.  He really does look like a beehive.  Jesus.  In the afternoon, Jose travels into Lisbon to pass time...  To horrify people.  To remind people what an asshole god is.  I get upset because the people, they come here, take a photo, don't say anything, and go.  Is that right?  They think you're a creature. 
[00:09:00]  Nice hat.  Oh, here's a hat.  But he puts a hat out for a dime.  I want to be able to talk to my friends, talk to everyone, and be able to cure my eyes.  I want to travel, to see what I've not seen.  Travel back to your home planet.  Like red lumpy shit in front of your eyes.  That's horrible.  Jose has had enough.  He leaves the square with his nephew, Diogo.  What did he think? 
[00:09:30]  Another victim.  He walks in front of the night together.  I apologize, Jesus.  I don't understand if he had a large wall on your face, but Jesus, dude.  He's a monster on a sweater.  Right.  I like how it bounces, though.  What was he going to hit?  I wouldn't hit anyone if I was you.  Yeah, it's very jiggly.  Don't use your fist.  Use your tumor.  Upset by the days of Benz, Jose becomes angry and frustrated.  You don't want anyone punching in the face.  That whole thing is going to just explode enough. 
[00:10:00]  That's invisible.  Squish it with your feet and make wine out if it comes down.  He feels that people see only his condition and not the man behind the face.  Well, then stay home.  Jesus Christ.  Just put a fucking Nixon mask over it.  Don't bother people.  Don't get mad at people for noticing that you're fucking horrid.  Jesus.  Is he holding it?  Oh, he's got to touch it all the time. 
[00:10:30]  You think he's got a food pocket?  He's a brain face.  He looks smart.  He looks really smart.  Hey, could you calculate some mathematics for me?  His face looks like kid cereal.  Cranberry tumor crunch.  It's like a bag of potatoes that I forgot about for six months.  Potato eye face.  He's got just a piece of cauliflower up top. 
[00:11:00]  Oh, he's awful.  His face looks healthy.  That's his nose.  That's his nose.  That's his nose way down there.  You guys see this video.  I think it's a very important consultation.  No face, I think.  Because it can define the rest of his life.  Yeah.  Be great if the doctor walked in with a fucking pillow.  Don't just save his life.  I have a solution.  He'll give Jose back his face.  You might have won the game, but you lose in life.  You might have won the dominoes game.  He's playing dominoes.  That's just fucking brutal. 
[00:11:30]  I won.  Yeah, but look at your face.  But life hates you.  Did you?  Did you really win?  The domino effect is this.  They should push his mother into drinking during pregnancy, and she tumbles into him in the  rest of his life.  That's it.  That's it.  Guys, it's not funny.  It's not funny.  It's not funny.  You got a brain face.  What's weird is this kind of thing always happens to some fucking dude in an ugly sweater  in Lisbon.  Why doesn't it happen to the president?  Imagine if the president got a mole, and then it just became this fucking shit face. 
[00:12:00]  And he was such a great president, you got to keep him in there.  Yeah, and you're like, oh, and he's got, oh, man, the president's face is fucking turned  into elephant shit.  A nose holder?  Jesus.  An official nose picker-upper?  An official nose holder.  Yes.  Come on.  Hang on.  Oh, what I was trying to say.  Hey, what's up?  It's Rob...  What are you talking about?  Oh, right then.  Hey, what's up?  It's Bob Kelly.  Go to robertkellylive.com and find out when I'm coming to your town. 
[00:12:30]  Again, that's robertkellylive.com or go to my MySpace, myspace slash robertkellylive.  You want to find out when I'm coming back to your town or fuck me, all my dates and info  are up on either one of those, so make sure you check them out and come down to one of  my shows.  Later, bitches.  All right, do it one more time.  No, you're done.  You're good.  No, I want to do that.  I want to do that one more time.  I want this one.  Ready?  Hey, what's up?  It's Bob Kelly.  If you want to...  Hey, it's Louis C.K., and this is the worst of fat Patrice O'Neil on the Opie and Anthony 
[00:13:00]  show, so listen to his black, large body make annoying fucking noises, fucking pile-high  shit, Patrice O'Neil.  We're going to get right into the show today, because we got Victoria standing by.  Oh, Victoria?  You guys are in the same field.  Victoria Zidrock?  God bless her, man.  What a great...  I was reading some of this.  This is...  You read her book?  No, what is it?  Oh, on scoring.  Dr. Z on scoring.  Let me tell you something.  We had her in a couple weeks ago, and she was very entertaining, but we were thinking, 
[00:13:30]  we got to get Patrice in with this woman, because you're in the same field, and Patrice  will soon be writing his sex-slash-relationship book.  So we're what you call colleagues.  Hey, how are you?  All right.  And she likes to take out her boobies and stuff.  There you go.  Oh, she's a very smart woman to use that in her advantage.  Yeah, absolutely.  Why be like these other fucking idiots and not use what you...  Right, got to use it.  What's your worst?  If you're not it, right?  Your body.  Look at the young TJ looking. 
[00:14:00]  Excited.  Very excited.  I'm TJ.  TJ Miller.  TJ was in a big Hollywood movie.  Oh, yeah?  Cloverfield.  And you know what?  Did you see it?  Patrice hated it.  The fact that she has a vagina almost makes her as important as everyone in here.  That's the good thing about having a vagina.  Yeah.  It ups their level.  Vagina power.  Yeah.  You've got to know the power of your vagina.  She's gorgeous.  Damn.  Look at her well-dressed.  Very sharp.  Very clean looking.  Look at the bra that barely, like, covers up the boobies through the shirt that is see-through. 
[00:14:30]  Right?  Nice look.  Right?  Matching bra, too.  Matching bra?  Very important.  Very important to who?  Well, important to everyone.  Matching bra.  Not men, but it's important to women.  What it is, it's important.  I think it's important to dress well.  I think Anglo-Saxon American women can't dress.  They can't, but it doesn't mean anything to Anglo-Saxon American men, by the way.  We don't even care if you can read, let alone write a book.  All right, hold on.  No, I think you do care.  I mean, men care for, like, a nice, tight dress versus, like, something baggy with sneakers.  Not really.  Just whatever's easier to get off. 
[00:15:00]  Dr. Z, Patrice O'Neill has a very unique way of looking, which is very smart, by the way,  and very brilliant.  Thanks, man.  Very logical.  So, Patrice has a very unique way of looking at love and relationships that is a little  different than yours.  That's why we invited Patrice in here today.  That's good.  I mean, you gave some great advice last time you were on the show, but you haven't heard  Patrice's angle yet.  Yeah.  My angle is just basically to cut out the editing system within men. 
[00:15:30]  There's a system that we have, excuse me, where at the bottom of your gut, you have  a feeling.  And women can go from the bottom of that gut.  I read in a couple of chapters of your book, there's some things here that's basically just  bottom of the gut things where this is what makes us happy.  Men have an editing system in the middle before it gets to our mouth and brain where we're  always trying to make someone else feel better before we open our mouths.  And I'm trying to cut that editing system out so that actually women can really, truly 
[00:16:00]  understand what we want, as opposed to, like, no offense, good things in your book, but it's  almost like this book is like if a fish was writing a book to fishermen to say how to catch  me.  Do you understand?  Yeah, exactly.  Why would I need help from a fish on how to catch you?  That makes no sense, doesn't exist.  That goes against what you really are.  This book is, there's no book on how to get men or how, there's no book that a woman could  write on how to get men to get you. 
[00:16:30]  It doesn't make any sense.  This is more of a woman power thing.  I think you have enough power in this game, in the relationship game.  That's what I think.  I don't think that you need help because that's what this book is basically, helping  women.  It's not helping men because what we do, this is completely against what we are, animal-wise.  This is a book on editing, like to give us tips, like one, I read one thing which says  one to ten, the worst things to talk about during a date. 
[00:17:00]  Right, right, right.  Don't talk about religion.  Don't talk about, it's like, what is there to talk about?  You're saying what you don't want to talk about.  Again, this is for you.  It's not for us.  No, but you don't, you listen.  That's the idea.  These are shortcuts.  Do you want to, do you want to-  Shortcuts to what?  Into her panties.  These are the shortcuts.  If you're going to start talking about religion, if you're going to start talking about your  mother, it's going to take you longer to get, if you're going to listen-  But ultimately, there is no shortcuts.  See, shortcuts to a woman's panties ends up being long cuts to my fucking life. 
[00:17:30]  You know what I mean?  Meaning, there's, you are not teaching women on how to give up pussy and walk up.  Pussy and walk away.  It doesn't exist.  No, I'm not teaching women.  I'm not teaching.  I'm teaching guys how to get beautiful women fast.  And, and yeah, sometimes-  This is nothing fast.  We're looking for, hey, how are you?  Listen, can I just stick my finger in?  That's what we're looking for.  You just basically, this is a how to pick up women.  This doesn't exist. 
[00:18:00]  This doesn't exist.  But, I mean, no disrespect to this book.  But again, we're talking, see how free you get to be when you tell a guy, here's how you  get us.  But why don't you listen to how we want to get you?  Because we're masters at getting.  But see, here's what you guys don't do.  Women don't, you should write a book on how to keep a man, which is your job.  Well, I don't need to keep a man.  I have a hard time getting rid of them, right?  So-  On what level, though? 
[00:18:30]  Let's be honest here.  Getting rid of them?  Is that what your life is?  Getting rid of men?  That's not even, that's against your nature.  No, no, exactly.  But I don't need a book on keep a man.  Do you know what I mean?  You do need a book on keeping a man.  And I'm not, I'm not writing for women, you know?  I mean, I'm writing for guys.  So basically, when you say you don't need a book.  This is an insight into how to score women that look like me.  That is impossible.  You know how to score you?  How do you do that?  Well, I know how to score, because I know how to score these kind of women.  I've hooked up with these women before. 
[00:19:00]  And how do you, how do you do it?  How do I score you?  Well-  Can any guy score you?  Of course.  Okay.  I've slept with hundreds of men.  Therefore, there's plenty of women.  That's beautiful.  I like you a lot for saying that, by the way.  You slept with hundreds?  I'm being really honest.  That's fantastic.  I had a very promiscuous young life.  And is that continued?  Because you've got to either hole them up or hole them down, to be honest with you.  Could that continue this afternoon?  What I'm saying is like-  I'm not answering you. 
[00:19:30]  No, promise.  But what I'm saying is that there are certain kind of men that turn women on naturally.  And the men that listen, the men, you know what?  It's very simple.  If you just say to a woman, how do you feel about that?  The woman's going to love you.  Because guess what?  You're strong but sensitive to me.  That's all you're going to say.  No, there's no thinking.  You're adding too much thinking to what guys want.  But there is no thinking.  It's too much.  There you go.  And here's what you're doing right now.  You're telling, you're telling, this is the thing.  You're telling, like say if I'm a shark swimming around the ocean, you got in the water and 
[00:20:00]  just told a shark how to be a shark and you're a tuna.  Like how do you tell me how to be what I am?  Do you feel me?  Like we don't want to tell you.  We do all this stuff.  We in this book, a lot of anyway, I didn't read the whole book.  It's things that we already do, but we don't want to do.  That's why we're losing our existence, which was a complete lie.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  We lie.  We don't go from our gut to our mouth. 
[00:20:30]  But I don't encourage guys to lie.  This is what you're encouraging.  No, no.  If I want to talk about religion, why can't I talk about religion?  You can talk about religion, but chances are if she's of a different religion, she's going  to get turned off and walk away.  Ready, hit, dastard.  There we go.  It's the arrogance.  It's better you find out right away.  Who gives a shit?  This is the problem we have.  It's all about what is turning you. 
[00:21:00]  Fuck you.  Not trying to be offensive, but fuck what you want, because really what it boils down to  is your vagina.  But do you want to complain or not?  It comes down to how badly is it?  That's the last thing.  There you go.  You're weighing your existence.  This guy here, right?  T.J. Miller.  T.J. Miller.  T.J. Miller.  The great T.J. Miller.  Fucking in an $80 million blockbuster movie, right?  I'm going to tell you that a vagina, he had to be in a movie, he has to be at comics, 
[00:21:30]  he has to be doing what he's doing in life to get some kind of stature just to get your  pussy.  This is what I'm saying.  Women never offer up.  Yours specifically, by the way.  I've been doing all this for yours specifically.  That's what I'm saying.  It doesn't impress you, but it fucking should.  The fact that I have to have a goddamn good credit.  I have to have a nice cop.  No, none of us.  Who cares a shit about good credit?  I don't talk about good credit.  Oh, I'm sorry.  You talk about everything else.  I talk about a bad boy.  I talk about being spontaneous and risk-taking. 
[00:22:00]  Who cares?  I talk about sense of humor.  I talk about confidence and authority.  We already know.  What do you have to have besides a twat?  Definitely not good credit.  Besides a twat.  What do women have to have to get a man?  You don't have to be charming.  How do you get a man without your pussy?  How would you get a man?  That is interesting.  How do I get a man?  Dr. Z, if you didn't have a pussy, how would you get a man?  How would you?  Well, you know, there's plenty of guys who are into things other than the pussy, unfortunately. 
[00:22:30]  But I'm just asking the question, if you didn't have a vagina, this is, I just, I get  very passionate about this.  Don't think I'm attacking you.  You know, no, I understand.  Wait a second, because here's what you're about to do.  You're about to do some woman stuff.  You're not going to answer the question.  You're going to spin it into actually something else.  You know, I've been to Rio de Janeiro, and if you watch Rio de Janeiro, you see these  women, you see these women in quotations, that stand there, and then you see guys pulling  over and getting blowjobs.  Guess what?  These are not women. 
[00:23:00]  These are transsexual.  This is exactly what I'm saying.  And guys love them.  What the fuck?  Vaginas have nothing to do with this.  We've done had nothing to do with the question.  See, I'm pretty, I'm pretty magical with this shit.  I knew you was going to switch it up.  But what I'm saying is, there's no, there is no, it has everything to do with it.  Vagina, there's never, there's no guy in here that's ever gotten pussy in their life  because they have a dick.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  Meaning, we can't just go, look at this dick, ladies. 
[00:23:30]  We have to have a skill level, a charm level.  We have to have a fucking, how many pages?  A 400 page book to read to figure out how to fuck beautiful women.  What do, have you ever charmed your way into dick?  Have you ever talked your way into anything?  Have you ever been charming?  Absolutely.  Have you ever taken a man out to dinner who didn't want to give you dick, but you fucking  talked your way into it?  Actually.  You talked your way into dick before?  I have, believe it or not.  Really, to a man that didn't want to fuck you?  Really?  What did you do? 
[00:24:00]  What were some of those charming things you did to make me want to fuck you and I didn't  want to at first?  I think what Patrice is saying.  Wait a minute, TJ, because here's why we fucked up.  Okay.  Because TJ, this is what we do.  We don't have ball togetherness, men.  Nope.  Because this is what makes us even, this is what makes us better than women too.  TJ, just sit back and enjoy.  TJ is going to go, ooh, this is a good time to play good cop, bad cop, right?  Where it's like, oh, see Patrice, this is what he's doing.  And no offense, but he's going to, he'll do anything to fuck you.  This is what he's doing. 
[00:24:30]  But for the basic part of it, we have an objective.  And you don't understand this objective.  Yeah, you have a revolutionary objective to fuck as many women as you can.  And you have an evolutionary objective to fuck one guy as much as you can.  Where's your skill to do that?  What do you mean my skill to do that?  Where's your skill to fuck, and instead of pretending that these hundreds of men you're  proud of, you really want one guy that you can call your man.  Yeah, I do.  Yeah, but how are you having that?  How are you keeping this guy?  How do you think I keep that guy? 
[00:25:00]  Good one.  How do you, ask me a question with a question.  This is what I'm saying.  This is all I'm saying.  How do I keep him?  It's hard for them to admit what they are.  Exactly.  Why?  This is what the fuck, this is what they boil themselves down.  They boil themselves down to sex.  And why are we supposed to make them better?  Why are we supposed to make them better than what they think their self is?  I also make a good living.  Much better living than my man does, so that helps as well.  Which is why your relationship is on the way out anyway, because you can't deal with 
[00:25:30]  having a guy that's less cool than you.  Oh, he's not less cool.  He absolutely is.  He's a man that is not better than his woman.  Why is he not better?  Because he doesn't make as much money as you.  But that doesn't define somebody better or worse.  It does for you.  No, he doesn't.  Yeah, you look at a king.  You ask me why?  You want a king in your life?  Is he your king?  Yeah, he's my king.  How's he your king when you're above him and you're the queen?  I don't think I'm above him.  Queen, king don't exist.  It's king, queen.  I don't think I'm above him.  I bet you're better than him. 
[00:26:00]  No, I'm not better than him.  We're equal.  You're just enjoying your control right now, but now, as soon as you get done with him,  he'll be gone.  I'm not done with him.  I mean, we're equal in this relationship.  You don't know how to make yourself happy.  And not you.  Women.  This is what it boils down to.  I'm an extremely happy person.  There's no way you're happy with a man that's less cool than you.  I don't think he's less cool.  He's a super cool guy.  Absolutely less cool than you.  Just because he makes less money doesn't make him cool.  We're not going to get to see boobies today.  Huh?  Nothing, nothing.  Nothing else, Patrice.  Go ahead. 
[00:26:30]  Continue.  I'm just saying, you're not tapping in.  Listen, I love what I read, but you're not tapping into the animal that you're dealing  with.  You're tapping into you, which is what women do.  You don't tap into us.  Us is a different thing from you, and you need to learn about us from us, not from you.  Well, Patrice has a different way of looking at relationships and stuff like that.  Patrice doesn't like commitment, doesn't like, he doesn't want to be married, likes to keep 
[00:27:00]  his woman.  Doesn't like the bullshit of the chase.  I don't dislike commitment.  What I don't like, Opie, is I don't like an unhappy guy, a traditional unhappy guy.  I don't like a guy.  I don't like an unhappy guy either.  But you have no choice to that.  I'm not that big on commitment myself.  I think most marriages should be open marriages on both sides.  But that's not to your nature.  You decided to go with the guys.  My nature?  Women's nature.  Women's nature is not to have.  Of course.  Because you're talking about years of a millennium of evolution. 
[00:27:30]  It's not to have a hundred different dicks in you.  I don't mind it.  But that's not what you crave, is a hundred different dicks.  You want one dick that you love.  You don't want to.  Yeah, I'm a joke.  When you say you want a hundred different dicks, you're being a guy.  But you're not being a guy.  A couple.  Well, you'd be surprised.  You know what?  Women are cheating as much as men do now.  Doesn't matter.  They're miserable when they're doing it.  Not always miserable.  You know why?  Because there's no satisfaction to how you get dick. 
[00:28:00]  You get dick by opening your legs.  Do you understand?  You can sit here and you sit there and you spread your legs and just go,  Fellas, one of you, would you like to touch it?  We'll all go, yeah.  If you had a room full of women and a dick came out and it's like,  Put your hands on it, ladies.  You would all go, ew, because it doesn't matter how you get dick.  You've been hanging out with the wrong women, Patrice.  I know you try to be different, but we all know.  Uh-uh.  I don't know.  We all know that you're a girl. 
[00:28:30]  You sit down to pee.  You have kids.  You do things that make you, even the act of being a girl.  What's so bad about being a girl?  Oh, it's just, look, I've done girl things.  You ever think you had to take a shit, but you just peed?  And you just was sitting there and sitting down peeing and how miserable you was just sitting down.  Like, what a bitch you felt like.  How demoralized you are by going, ugh, I'm sitting down to pee.  You ever lay back and pretend, like, play fuck with your girl and put yourself in missionary position just for a game?  And the idea of someone laying, you're laying on your back with your legs back and someone is fucking you, it is embarrassing. 
[00:29:00]  Bleeding every month for no reason?  You are miserable.  God made you miserable.  You know what guys do that's fun?  We have an activity where once in a while, maybe me, once every other day, I kill life.  If I squirt life anywhere, on my girl's chest, on a sock, anywhere, there's no activity where a woman enjoys just killing eggs. 
[00:29:30]  There's no activity where they go, yay, there's an egg on the floor.  This is why you're miserable.  Because your happiness, wait a minute, your happiness is based on thinking you're a man.  Wait, but if, so you want women to have, like, eggs roll out of their body and then just take a hammer,  just start smashing it.  Well, that's, they don't understand what it's like to be frivolous.  They're not frivolous with their body.  That's why I know a hundred guys, fucking a hundred guys, means nothing to a woman. 
[00:30:00]  It's not happiness because there's no gratification to it.  There's no hunt.  You know what you're hunting?  Love.  And you don't know how to get it.  Yeah, some women hunt love.  You hope, you hope this guy that you fuck will love you.  It's scratching the lottery.  You don't know how to get love.  Have no clue.  Wow.  All right, let's talk to T.  Wow.  So, it's your rant on how great it is to be a man.  You know it, because your book, you're on the men's side, not on the women's side. 
[00:30:30]  This book says it right here.  You're on our side.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, fair enough.  But let me tell you, why do you think so many men out there, so many men, and they email me all day long,  want to be women?  And how come majority of transsexuals and transvestites dress up as women?  So they get out of control over what they don't have control over.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  So who is miserable here?  Majority of transsexuals are men, male to female.  They're miserable.  They all want to be girls.  They all want to be submissive. 
[00:31:00]  They just want to control pussy.  They all want to dress up.  They all want to dress up in girly clothes.  That's why pimps are loved.  People love pimps.  Not because they can put women on the street and make them sell their pussy,  but the mind of how do I control something that's controlled by an unlikable creature.  Like, you're awful.  If I control pussy, boy, pussy be great.  I don't know about that.  I would bring the value of pussy down to zero if I own the pussy.  You know what, I think majority of men would love to be a woman. 
[00:31:30]  That's why so many, it's one of the biggest fetishes.  Are you serious?  What, sit down and pee?  Are guys wearing female panties?  That's huge.  It's control.  It's huge on the internet.  It's to have an idea of how it is to control the vagina.  You know, because God has given a miserable animal the power to control something to make us happy.  Yeah, Patrice hates vaginas.  That's why he already likes the vagina.  He just doesn't like all the shit that's around it and the shit it takes. 
[00:32:00]  Seriously.  It bothers me how little women bring to the table and how many demands you have.  I don't think we have a lot of demands.  You know what?  How many demands do we have?  I don't know.  Let's read chapter six.  What are the demands?  Here's the hit.  Being gregarious, taking up space and looming.  What's bad?  Being a loud mouth.  I think guys have way more demands.  Hey, we have to look beautiful.  We have to look young.  We have to wear lingerie for you.  We have to be thin.  How many demands do you have? 
[00:32:30]  Fair enough.  You know what that boils down to?  One thing.  Object.  Just be an object.  An object of desire.  Perfect object.  That's what your job is.  So that's a lot more demands.  All we want you guys to do is show up.  I want a shiny watch, not a scruffy one.  All we want you to do is not be scruffy.  We have way more demands.  We don't want anything from you.  We don't care if you're bold.  We don't care.  I talk about appearance.  We are not shallow.  We don't care if you don't shave.  We don't have any of this.  We have to shave your legs for you.  We have to look perfect. 
[00:33:00]  We have to dye it for you.  Put makeup.  Wear lingerie.  How many demands is that?  Enunciate.  Okay.  Enunciate.  This is your book.  This is my book.  Oh, good.  Here it is.  Here it is.  Who wants the guy who mumbles?  Top 10 worst physical.  But here's the thing.  We shit a mumbling guy.  Because here's the thing.  Even though you're a doctor.  I think you brought him to mumble if he's going down on you.  Even though you're a doctor.  I'm just sharing with you the animal.  Just because you're a doctor doesn't make you any sexier.  Any sexier as a woman being a doctor. 
[00:33:30]  This weekend.  Oh, you're very wrong.  As it does.  Yeah, two sold out shows.  Sorry about that.  No, go, go.  We don't call him out because we love pussy.  But the fact is, after the pussy, then what?  Then what?  All right, so wait.  After the pussy, then what?  What are you getting at?  After we do our job.  Then you're in hell after that?  No, after we do our job.  And get the pussy.  And get what we're trying to get initially.  Some of us try to pretend we're looking for love.  But no guy goes out and goes, listen, fellas.  Let's go.  Hey, Than.  Opie.  Everybody, let's get together because let's all go out and find love. 
[00:34:00]  It doesn't happen.  We go out and search for a certain thing.  That's what we're built to do is hunt for that.  The other thing, if it happens, it happens.  But it shouldn't happen because we get pussy.  I shouldn't.  That's like, you know, it's like going fishing on a fishing boat, right?  All the things you have to do.  You buy the bait.  You go out in the ocean.  You find a perfect spot.  You fish.  You fish.  You catch this big thing on the fucking hook.  You get this giant tuna.  And you're like, holy shit.  Look what I did.  Then you throw the tuna back in the water. 
[00:34:30]  And then the fucking fish jumps back in the boat.  See, I don't get him at all.  And goes, I love you.  You go, motherfucker.  It's so funny.  Guys love to pretend they're not looking for love, right?  But you know what statistics shows?  Statistics show that men fall in love a lot faster than women do on the first day.  These are statistics on psychological studies.  Men are three times more likely to kill themselves after romantic breakup.  Women get over romantic breakup a lot quicker. 
[00:35:00]  Men live longer in marriages than those who are not.  So statistics show that men are much better off when they're in love.  I think Patrice would say that.  But they go around.  But they like to say, these are statistics you cannot reject.  I reject statistics.  You can reject anything you want.  But I'm trying to tell you, these are studies.  A hundred studies?  Oh, no.  These are studies.  You can't count.  You've got to study.  You've got to study.  Men love to walk around and say, oh, we don't want love.  We don't want love.  But statistics show that they do.  Because we get love easy. 
[00:35:30]  Why the fuck do you love me?  I don't know.  Why do you think a guy would be more depressed?  Women are very conditional about their life.  Why do you think a guy would be more depressed after a breakup than a woman?  Why do you think so?  Exactly.  Why do I think so?  Yeah.  Because women have social networks.  You know what?  They talk to their girlfriends.  They move on a lot faster.  No.  Guys dwell on stuff.  They don't express emotions.  Because a woman can go out that night and have a dick.  And the guy has to search around.  And maybe at four in the morning, he's fucking drunk and going home to jerk off. 
[00:36:00]  Because he didn't get anything.  And then the next night, the girl can go out and get another dick.  And the guy, again, has to go out and work his ass off to try to get.  I'm fucking so tired of vaginas.  Why are they three times more?  Adding up.  Why do you guys kill each other all the time?  I am so tired of vaginas.  Over pussy.  Adding up to your whole life.  Why are they dueling over that?  Anthony.  Over pussy.  Anthony, you're a famous millionaire.  A famous millionaire.  But a fucking loser could fuck you because she has a pussy. 
[00:36:30]  A fucking loser.  Like a woman who has nothing extra except for a vagina can fucking feel like she's at your level.  Do you understand?  You're not at the social status, the thinking status.  You don't have friends.  First of all, women don't have friends with each other.  That's why you want to hang around us all the time.  Because we're better at being friends.  Do you know any information about your friends that could ruin their lives?  Their lives.  No. 
[00:37:00]  Yes, we do.  Really?  As a matter of fact.  You could destroy one of your girlfriend's lives?  Absolutely.  Do it.  Let's see.  Let's hear it.  What is it?  What is it?  Which woman?  Guys.  About.  Women talk to each other more than guys do.  Would you hide a gun for your girlfriend if she committed a murder?  Yeah.  I would.  She knows that.  See, let me tell you why she's good.  She knows.  You hit a gun?  She knows.  In case, I might need my bitch to hide a gun.  Might.  But she knows.  She's smart enough to know the guy answer to this. 
[00:37:30]  But you can feel this right here.  She's a little bit annoyed with her own life.  Because this is what I'm saying.  And this is what she cut me off on.  I got it.  I think more like a guy.  Dr. Z.  Doctor.  I think more like a guy.  I have to admit.  You can't think like a guy.  She's had a hundred dicks.  Just because she's stuck.  She's had a hundred dicks.  She's had a lot of dicks.  She's had a lot of dicks.  What does she have had?  She's got to give her that.  Let's at least be in agreement that she's had a lot of dicks.  But her having a hundred dicks is as easy as you eating these bag of chips. 
[00:38:00]  Like it's no big deal.  I understand that.  My sister and I had actually a competition who would have more.  More dicks?  What competition is that?  That's like a great competition.  Are you guys going to have that again?  It's like a hot dog eating competition.  It's a great competition.  Did you guys have a dick sucking contest?  This is not a new one.  No, no.  Not a dick sucking.  What?  This is not.  I'm sorry.  It's not impressive.  She's wearing me down now.  You know why it's not impressive?  She said a hundred dicks.  Because she could suck a thousand. 
[00:38:30]  She only sucked a hundred.  But Patrice, we want to hear about the hundred that she did suck.  She's wearing us down a little bit.  I got to be honest.  You know what?  Because all these sex sports write about techniques.  You're a bunch of holes.  That's what women are.  Just three holes.  Three holes.  Basically, that's what it is.  Is that in the book, how to get women, just saying you're a bunch of holes?  Yeah.  Oh, well, no, but I do talk in the book about how to get anal and why, and how most women 
[00:39:00]  actually, most women love it.  Most women love it.  I'm going to control this a little bit, or at least attempt to.  How does one get yours or another woman's asshole?  And if we can come back to the fucking competition with your sister, do that later.  But first, we'll do that.  So how do you get asshole?  Patrice saying, let me fuck you in the ass is not going to get him any ass.  Whatever.  And I'm wondering how much he's actually gotten in his lifetime. 
[00:39:30]  I'm really wondering.  Patrice is not helping.  He's getting guys less, less pussy rather than more.  Yeah, of course.  Because this kind of approach is going to turn women off.  But that's what they want.  There's a million of you.  This is for angry guys.  You fucked a hundred guys.  Did they all do the same thing to get you?  They were all mad.  You didn't fuck some guys on the first night?  The first day you met him? 
[00:40:00]  They all had to qualify.  Of course.  Exactly.  They all had to qualify.  They had to offer.  They had to imply all their hard work to get your twat.  No.  Not at all.  But yes, they did.  Yes, they did.  But they had to offer me some value, some interest.  Of course.  Something.  They didn't come up to me and say, let me fuck you.  Of course not.  But what did they do?  Dinner?  Movie?  Oh, boy.  We're not going to find out about this.  No, not necessarily that.  I mean, I am just wanting to hear it.  Oh, boy.  Sorry.  Let me just need to know.  Let me.  Let me.  Let me.  Let me.  Let me.  Let me.  Let me.  All weekend. 
[00:40:30]  We've got.  We're going to.  I enjoy the Patrice angle.  You know, Patrice.  I'm listening.  All right.  Just listen for a minute.  You're listening to mine.  I'm going to fucking cut people.  But this is.  Watch it.  This is more vaginal horse.  Well, let me.  Let me listen to you.  No, no.  I want to hear Patrice's approach.  No, no.  I want to hear his approach.  No, talk us through.  What is his recommendation for scoring with women?  Well, you get us some asshole.  Now.  Because right now.  I got some tips.  Right now.  All he gave us is how not to get any pussy.  And why pussy means nothing.  I want to know his approach. 
[00:41:00]  What is his advice to a guy to score with a woman?  Here is a woman in a bar.  Or how do you score with her?  I want to know.  I don't have a device on how to pick up women.  Well, exactly.  You don't have a device.  All you have is just angry, angry bitch and complain.  We'll go back to the S5.  It's just angry bullshit.  That's all it is.  There you go.  That's the real shit.  There you go.  I like that.  That's what I want.  The real shit.  Yeah, it's just angry crap.  Your emotional horse shit.  That's what you all are.  Emotional.  Where is that emotional? 
[00:41:30]  You are in your vagina.  I am very calm.  You are getting emotional.  Because I take it very seriously.  You are the one who is getting emotional.  You qualified your shithole.  Women that give up their shithole is less better than you.  Because all you do is fuck a hundred guys with your pussy.  But you're very careful with the shithole.  The shithole is less important.  You know how you get the asshole?  You eat the pussy.  Lick the asshole.  And it feels good. 
[00:42:00]  Then you put a finger in it.  And then the bitch wants to do something.  Want to know how you pee on your girl?  In the shower.  Want to know how to get her to suck your dick?  Slap her in the face with it.  This is what's wrong with you.  You direct too many of your movies.  Open up.  That's what the fuck you do.  All right.  Well, I guess we...  What the fuck you don't know?  You're the fucky.  How you gonna tell me how to fuck you?  We actually...  You get fucked!  We have that.  So the question has been answered, Dr. Z.  And thank you for coming in today.  Dr. Z, do you agree with Patrice's approach on the asshole? 
[00:42:30]  You are the fuck E!  Patrice's book is considerably shorter than yours.  Uh, yeah.  Patrice's pamphlet.  It's more of a pamphlet.  Right.  Yeah, I would see that.  Would you agree with that as far as how to get the asshole?  No.  You are fucking losers trying to make a...  Here's what you're trying to do.  Have a man and have a woman at the fucking same time.  We're men.  We're better than you.  We want a guy.  We don't want a woman.  We don't want a wussy guy.  Yeah.  We don't want that.  A non-wussy guy is better than you.  It trickles down from you. 
[00:43:00]  They don't know.  The only thing they know...  So you're saying you can get a woman to do anything you want.  You don't negotiate with them.  If you tell that...  So this is actually interesting, because it sounds like you guys are saying the same thing.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying, too.  I think you're on the same page.  Oh, but...  Yeah, Patrice.  I think you...  Right there, I think.  Of course, go ahead.  By sticking your dick in the first time you meet her...  I didn't say that, but why shouldn't you fuck her in the ass the first time as opposed  to the pussy the first time?  What's the...  I don't get it.  Good question, doctor.  Why?  Because most women are defensive about that, and most women are uncomfortable. 
[00:43:30]  And you know why most women?  Because you make up your own movie that stars you as you, stars you as me, stars you as  the director, you're the producer.  No.  Stop doing...  They don't know what they like.  Anytime you fuck a girl...  Most women...  Anytime you fuck a girl and she tells you what she likes, that means she likes it because  some other dude did it.  And she goes, oh, I like that.  But you don't have an explorative mind where you go, you know what? 
[00:44:00]  I wonder what it's like.  If it wasn't for the fact a guy tried to fuck you in your ass, you wouldn't go, boy, I want  to get fucked in my ass.  We bring everything to you.  Your whole idea is based on you want to be a man.  You think you think like a man?  Because thinking like a woman is so fucking awful.  That's why you think like a man.  I'll tell you why I'm mad.  Yeah, why are you mad, Patrice?  I am mad.  I'm just mad.  And not at her.  It's just like you figure somebody with doctor in front of their name, right, would just be 
[00:44:30]  saying something you haven't heard from the average bitch that work at McDonald's.  Like they just...  You're just saying the same horse shit.  I've got the bathroom.  It's like, it's just, it's like, you know, to ask, hey, how do you do ass to mouth?  It's the same as how do you fuck her?  You know what I mean?  It's like once you figure out the control of how to talk a woman out of being like their  typical horse shit, it's just getting around their typical bullshit because they don't 
[00:45:00]  have a filter.  They don't, they go from how they feel to coming out their fucking mouth.  They never explore how to have an option on how to think.  She believes that just because she thinks she thinks like a guy, that makes her a guy.  Like, no.  Like when I was getting ready to say doctor, do you realize the fact that you're a doctor  doesn't make you more attractive than if you fucking was the woman garbage man.  No, it doesn't make me more attractive.  It doesn't.  It doesn't make you more attractive to you because you are into skanky women who are not 
[00:45:30]  doctors, but there's plenty of guys to whom it does make me more attractive.  I'll give you an example that Patrice brought up.  I'll give you an example of a point he brought up.  You take a plumber.  Just a guy.  He's a plumber.  Average looking guy.  He walks up and he tries to get into, I don't know, some Hollywood starlet's pants at some  party.  He's lucky enough to somehow get his way in there.  He's not getting near her. 
[00:46:00]  If he talks to her for two seconds, he's being driven away.  It's just, it ain't going to work.  You put the shoe on the other foot where some girl comes in, attractive looking, doesn't  have to be the best looking girl in the world, can absolutely hook up with a rock star or  George Clooney or any other guy because for no other reason than she has a vagina that  the guy wants to get into.  That's not true.  And that she's high. 
[00:46:30]  What's a Halle Berry ends up with this movie star.  I mean, a movie star Halle Berry ends up with some, with some, with some model, some guy  who's nobody but has a cute face.  It's a model, though.  It's a model.  It's not a fucking model.  He's not a guy that makes money for being attractive.  But do you think male, do you think George Clooney is going to hook up with just any girl?  He's going to hook up with a hot girl.  He's going to fuck her?  He's going to fuck her.  Yeah, a hot girl.  Right.  You just answered me.  Well, it's the same way the other way around.  But it doesn't matter.  Halle Berry's going to fuck her guy because he's a model.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  He has nothing else to offer to her. 
[00:47:00]  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  The model, or the hot girl that George Clooney hooks up with, can be a fucking receptionist  at a haircutting salon.  You think it doesn't work the other way around?  The hot guy that Halle Berry hooks up with, he ain't going to be no fucking guy that works  for the telephone company.  This is going to be a model guy, some fucking director, producer, or some shit.  No.  He's nobody.  He's nobody.  He's nobody.  Because the guy needs to have something, and the girl needs to have a pussy. 
[00:47:30]  The point is, the point is, we're less shallow.  We're looking for qualities other than your looks.  You guys only care about, you don't care how dumb a woman is.  You don't care if she's like a complete...  There you go.  This is the real work for her.  This is girl coming out.  But that makes you a shallow guy.  This bullshit Dr. Z is disappearing, baby.  No, that's true.  Now we're going to come on.  Now Victoria Sornack is coming the fuck out, baby.  No, but I'm not getting... 
[00:48:00]  There you go, right.  But that's exactly the point.  Good job, TJ.  Good job.  Anthony just said what's true, which is that a guy needs to have external things about him.  He needs to have other things to level the planking.  Right.  All the girl has to do is be attractive.  Now if a guy...  But what is that...  Why won't a girl go out with a guy who works at the telephone company and is like kind of good looking?  They go out all the time.  I know.  I've been...  Do you want me to give you names?  I'll give you names of women. 
[00:48:30]  I used to work at Radio Shack.  I'll give you some...  I'll give you some...  Hold on.  Can I just please...  I'll give you...  No, please.  Wait a second.  I'm trying...  I'm not...  No, I'm not...  No, I'm not...  No, I'm not...  The lowball insults.  That's all you've been doing.  Fair enough.  I'm going to give you names.  This is what I'm talking about.  No, no.  This is the real boiling down to be a girl.  I'm going to give you names of women who ended up with...  I'm going to fucking let you talk all...  I just want to say this one thing about your book.  Just on this point.  This is an entire book on what a guy should do to get pussy. 
[00:49:00]  Right.  Not to get...  Not to have a life...  To get good looking one.  Not to have a life with her.  Not to understand anything about all this shit to get...  You are...  Because guys don't care about getting a life.  They care about getting pussy.  That's your point right there.  This is why you're trying to control...  They don't want a book of relationships.  But this...  But here's what your book does.  I'm not controlling anything.  I'm giving guys...  Here's what this book does. 
[00:49:30]  I'm giving guys quick tips.  This book makes guys act a certain way so that when you finally give up the pussy,  he might have an emotional investment in you.  No.  This book has nothing to do with emotional investment.  This book has emotional investing qualities.  That's exactly what...  No.  What are you talking about?  Why don't you just write a book called Ladies Give Up Your Pussy and Stop Playing?  That's your book.  This is the book you need to write, ladies give up your pussy.  But why wouldn't you...  If you have a male point of view, why wouldn't you just write it for women?  Because I don't write books for women. 
[00:50:00]  I don't want to write books for women.  But you're writing books for men that have nothing to do with how the fuck we feel.  Let me tell you how behind you guys are.  In the year one, or whenever you found out pussy was valuable, and you found out some  guy would give his rocks up for your vagina.  About millions years ago.  A million years ago.  And I say men are behind the pussy a million years.  But we are evolving because we're tired of giving up everything we work for for twat. 
[00:50:30]  So, you're basically staying the same as you were in the year 07 or whatever.  So, how are you evolving?  We're evolving by understanding that all your demands that you have as women, all the things  you want, you're not going to get it.  You know, it's very simple.  You have to earn what you want.  It boils down to two things.  Eggs are rare.  There's not that many of them.  Sperm is plenty.  Therefore, you've got something that there's lots of.  We've got something that's rare.  You want your jeans passed on, you've got to play the dance. 
[00:51:00]  That's how it works.  That's not true.  We are the carriers of the jeans.  It's absolutely not true.  Yes, that's how it is.  Well, no, scientifically it's true.  But how you're making it.  You're not going to change anything.  But you're not special because you're a girl.  You're not special because you can have babies.  Why are you making it first?  You're not special.  We just happen to be the dudes that shoot it out.  You happen to be the receivers.  Like, you're not a special person because nature said that you have babies. 
[00:51:30]  You're not special.  It's just nature.  You're missing the point.  You're missing the point.  Guys want to pass on as many of their jeans as possible.  We want to be selective.  And that's how it works.  It's always going to be.  We've got something you want.  We can pass on your jeans.  Without us, you cannot pass on your jeans.  When you were talking to all these guys, it was all pleasure.  And so you kind of went against nature.  I'm a little different from most women.  I see.  I don't agree that you are.  You don't agree that?  No, because look at all these angry sips of water. 
[00:52:00]  I like her now.  I like Dr. Z now.  She's getting out on her horse shit.  I really like it.  I really like the fact that she heard the dig she's saying I'm giving.  She was giving.  Like, oh, you like to fuck scuzz bites.  Yeah.  But I fuck doctors too.  They're just as fucking dumb as every other girl.  I've met dumb garbage girls and I've met dumb doctors when it comes to this game.  You can't win it because you have no skill to get what you want. 
[00:52:30]  We have the skill to get pussy.  We don't need this book.  What is your skill?  We'll give guys a specific skill.  We also have to have the skill.  What is the skill?  I want to know the skill.  The skill is all whatever you've done over here.  Like, he has a different skill.  I have different.  I don't have a how to pick up.  You have a skill.  I got to give you.  You got the gift of gab.  But there's a lot of guys out there who don't have the skill.  Exactly.  And my book gives them the skill.  No, they don't.  Your book teaches them how.  Lookit.  It gives them the skill.  A fucking retard with a job.  This is what makes guys different than women get attracted to other things. 
[00:53:00]  Your downfall is that you're not as shallow as us.  So a retarded guy can go.  A retarded millionaire can go.  Listen.  You know what?  I want a million dollars, but I can't.  He can get pussy.  A retarded billionaire woman is in deep shit.  That is the book that I want to read.  The Retarded Millionaire's Way to Get Pussy.  I like The Retarded Billionaire Woman is in Deep Shit for a book title. 
[00:53:30]  If you're going to get a companion book.  Hey, handsome, can you?  Let me tell you.  A coffee table book.  If you've got money, you're going to get pussy or dick.  It doesn't matter what gender you are.  Have you struggled to get dick?  No.  Man, so what do you know?  Have you struggled to get pussy?  Of course.  I'm a fat motherfucker.  I had to learn how to get pussy.  I want to manage the Patrice and Dr. Z sex show.  Oh, can I call you Vicky?  It would be the greatest radio show ever to be on.  Oh, yeah.  Patrice would be on his feet. 
[00:54:00]  And let me tell you something.  She has a man, but this is exactly, I could fuck her so easy based on the fact that she  fucking hates my guts.  That's all it is.  I don't hate you at all.  I actually find you very entertaining.  You know what?  Like a big bear.  No, I actually went.  What would you do right there?  And you know what?  I can't even begin to imagine what sex would look like between the two of them.  You only want to fuck me because I'm hot, right?  I actually would like to.  You're not bad.  That would be the definition of hate fucking. 
[00:54:30]  I like to fuck guys.  Wait, wait, wait.  Who are quick with it and who have a good sense of humor.  You're not bad.  And let me explain to you what you are.  And this is not an insult.  Because this is a thing we apply.  Because a guy like me, a guy that's not a fucking model, good looking dude.  Sure.  Okay.  A guy doesn't have to be model good looking.  We usually go one to ten when guys are going, hey, explaining the hot girl.  Hey, one to ten.  What'd you give her, man?  Ooh, she's like a nine.  In real life, you're a ten.  But we went up to 30. 
[00:55:00]  Okay?  Me and my friends went up from one to 30.  And what we did is break that 30 down into three categories of ten.  The first ten is ugly bitches.  The second ten is okay looking bitches.  And the third ten is beautiful bitches.  So a number 20 is either a beautiful, okay looking woman or an ugly, fine woman.  A ten is a gorgeous, ugly woman.  An 11 is an ugly, okay looking woman. 
[00:55:30]  What's Dr. Z?  I love this scale.  Dr. Z is a 21.  To me.  She's an ugly, beautiful woman.  She is as gorgeous of an okay woman as you can get.  But the reason you do this is not to insult a woman.  It's to know how much confidence to have.  It's true.  Like, I don't have 30 confidence, but I know I can get a 22.  Uma Thurman is a 10. 
[00:56:00]  I give her a 25.  She's a beautiful, ugly woman.  You know, actually it's funny.  I love this scale.  Because if you read my book, I have this whole thing on demystifying beauty.  Because guys go gaga over beauty.  And that's exactly what I tell them.  Tell yourself beauty is common.  Beauty is out there.  You know what?  Beauty is a dime a dozen.  I want something more substance than just beauty.  And if you talk to yourself like that, you can actually demystify beauty and have the power to come up to any woman.  Because, you know what, guys, not any woman, though, depending on, really, on, because you might not have the confidence. 
[00:56:30]  Because what that does is give confidence.  Like, if you look at a woman and go, eh, she's a 15.  Exactly.  But that's exactly what, by the way, I talk to her like a 15.  But the 30, you might have trouble talking to her.  Are you all about the big cock?  No.  At all.  And actually, if you read my book, if I read my book, I have a whole chapter on my size does not matter, guys.  So it does not matter.  So you're telling me.  But no one cares. 
[00:57:00]  I still want a baby on, Jack.  I want a fucking pole of death.  There are big dick girls just like there's big.  My girls won.  There's big, there's guys who are into big ass tits, who are into those ridiculous tits, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There are guys that are into small tits.  Exactly.  There are girls that are into small tits.  Yes, yes.  There's guys.  But that's a bad analogy, because you're not stuffing a titty in my asshole.  No, it's the same thing.  You're not filling up anything.  Which is also an image I did not expect to have in my mind today with Patrice O'Neal stuffing a titty in his ass. 
[00:57:30]  There's guys who love big clits.  Should we send your mom to breakfast, TJ?  There's guys who don't like big clits, right?  The whole thing with men is that men, for some reason, think that women don't want sex.  Women want sex.  But it has to be sex worth having.  You know what?  If I'm going to shave my pussy, shave my legs, get ready, and then you're going to cum in four minutes, which is the average for American male.  It's not worth it for me.  Okay?  So learn to laugh.  What about you laying there like a fucking mummy?  What about the fact that you won't fucking lick my balls? 
[00:58:00]  What about the fact that you won't let me spit in your face?  She would lick your balls, Patrice.  Relax.  Do you like it when a woman sticks fingers up your ass?  No.  See, now you're like, oh, I'm not like that.  I'm not a homer.  But guess what?  But I do like when she licks it, though.  I do like when she licks it.  Majority of guys love it.  Majority of guys.  Majority.  Majority love prostate massage.  I bet it does.  But now you're like, oh, I'm too much of a guy.  I would never have a woman.  No, I didn't say that.  Because that would make me as a homer.  I said it because I tried it, and here's what it is. 
[00:58:30]  Women don't do it.  You do nothing with a legitimate passion.  Now he's backtracking.  He's like, no, no, no, no.  When women finger you, it's always some way of making you a fag.  Like, if a girl.  Seriously, no.  No, no, no.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  It's nothing to do with that.  It's nothing to do with that.  But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but,  Patrice is hard to suck for this.  Vicky, Vicky, can I, can I, can I, can I, can I, may I say this?  It's, it's a thing where, like, okay, I don't like a girl to suck my dick. 
[00:59:00]  I like a dick sucker.  Let me explain that.  Meaning, I don't like a girl who goes, oh yeah, I'm sucking your dick for you.  I want a girl that sucks dick full, but she's a dirty dick sucker.  Now, if there was a girl, if there was a girl that had to put her finger in my asshole,  she's like, I got to, motherfucker.  I got balls in my face, I'm jerking your dick.  Yeah.  And just some fucking animal that's fucking jerking and poking, then I'm like, I would 
[00:59:30]  never cock block that.  But some chick that goes, I'm going to show you what it's like to do.  That's what most girls do to see if they can take manhood.  Because you're tired of being the fuck-y.  Fucking brilliant.  You're the fuck-y.  We're the fucker.  Anything that makes you the fuck-y, you like sticking a finger.  You don't want to stick a finger in a man's ass.  Why do you say that?  I don't know about that.  You've been with wrong women.  You've been with wrong women.  Oh, God damn.  Oh, man. 
[01:00:00]  You've been with wrong women.  I haven't been, I've been with every kind of piece of shit.  See, for you to degrade us, you have to do some dirty, filthy shit that we don't mind.  Now, you just told me that.  You just told me that you don't mind.  You're like, it's okay.  Let me ask you this.  How would you, how do, what would you think about degrading a man?  What's degrading a man?  Yeah.  What about putting that strap on right now?  You turn over and I'm going to fuck you in the ass.  And getting fucked in the ass.  The only way a woman can degrade a man is becoming the fuck-y.  So?  You're the fuck-y. 
[01:00:30]  All right, she's out of something.  Let's turn the table.  She's out of something.  Who wants to get fucked in the ass by Dr. Z today?  You know what?  Would you fuck someone in the ass?  Yeah.  Who wants to be fucked in the ass?  Patrice made a great point about someone being so filthy that they got to pass a level  of filth that I don't think they can attain to legitimately degrade.  They could do something to go like, oh, I'm going to degrade this person.  Yeah.  But what's the bullshit about degrading?  You know?  I'm sitting on your face.  My asshole's on your face.  Well, thank you, precious. 
[01:01:00]  To me, sex.  How about my balls?  Hey, shut up.  Shut up.  Slick my balls in your mouth.  Come on, dude.  Put my balls in your mouth.  There you go.  That's it.  Now, blink, doc.  But what's the thing about degrading?  You know?  Like, the whole thing.  Sex.  In order for sex to be good, it has to be dirty.  Let me wrap these big black hands around your fucking head.  Shut the fuck up, doctor.  What kind of doctor are you, bitch?  Let me see your fucking credentials.  Shut up!  Come on, you like that?  You like that fucking thing in your ass?  You like it?  Give me a kiss. 
[01:01:30]  Give me a fucking kiss.  Oh, you didn't like that, did you?  How about this degrading?  You didn't like that.  How about you cum in my ass and you suck it out?  Again!  I've been sucking out your own cum.  Again!  Again!  I have to do things that you do.  How about I just use you as the object you are?  Fine.  Slap you in the face.  Shut up.  Once women would love you.  Shut up.  You want cum in your mouth.  I want pussy juice.  If you put pussy juice in your ass, I'll lick it out.  But you know why? 
[01:02:00]  You can't just shoot pussy juice nowhere.  This follows the whole thing, though, that you've been talking about.  Like, you get into this degrading thing and stuff and wondering where the questions are  coming from or where the conversation's going or how it took off in a new direction.  It's still all intertwined in this sexuality thing between men and women where guys will  fuck most any girl that will fuck them.  And girls need this whole big thing happening. 
[01:02:30]  Right.  Well, you know, I explained it to you why.  It's very simple.  From an evolutionary perspective, sperm, there's billions of them.  There's limited amount of eggs.  You want to pass on your genes, your DNA.  I'm talking about everyone that's fucking doesn't want to procreate or isn't thinking  about it.  I know, but you're not thinking.  But subconsciously, it's always there.  But I think you have an evolutionary program to do that.  I don't know.  The point that I know about that is a consciousness.  If you're not going to do that, then that is what evolutionary psychology is all about.  You all think we're evolved. 
[01:03:00]  We're all above that.  But you know what?  You're just a human animal.  You're just a human animal.  So women don't enjoy it as much genetically on an evolutionary level.  They don't enjoy it as much.  But women have to be more selective because guess what?  They don't want to be stuck raising all these little breasts by themselves.  You wouldn't be able to be selective if you enjoyed it as much.  And hear what she just said?  It boils down to God or nature, whatever you believe in.  I don't believe in God.  I'm an atheist.  Atheist.  So it boils down to nature making women miserable and they want us to suffer for their misery. 
[01:03:30]  Because we basically, I'm telling you, raising kids for men, if I shoot it in her or if  I shoot it on her, it's the same thing.  Being a father, you could be a father to somebody that you don't create.  The actual creation process is a curse for them.  Because women animals, the female human, act like a fucking turtle where she lays a hundred  eggs and says, good luck to you. 
[01:04:00]  Women are cursed the rest of their life with the love they have for their child.  I'm almost 40.  Why are you falling into a curse?  And my mother is cursed with the fact that she loves me.  Meaning, oh my God, I wish I didn't give a fuck about this big mouth asshole.  But I'm concerned about it.  I feel like that's happening with my mother today.  Right now.  That's currently happening to my mother.  She's almost 60 years old and she still cares for me.  You're telling me your father doesn't give a shit about you?  I never met the motherfucker.  And I can understand why.  Because I could have been on a sock or I ended up inside my mother. 
[01:04:30]  That's what the fuck happened.  I think that explains a lot of your anger.  Of course.  The fact that you never met your daddy.  That's all the daddy.  Exactly.  It's a speech for the daddy you never met.  You fucking cornball and boy, I'm going to fuck your brains out, doc.  It's the daddy speech.  I'm going to fucking stick my thumb right in your booty hole one of these days.  Trust me.  When your fucking boyfriend looks at you and worships you, finally, you finally get rid of  that fucking asshole.  You let me know, Miss fucking Third World.  I'm going to fucking fuck the shit out of you, doc. 
[01:05:00]  That's what?  And I'm going to smack you all in your ass with your own book.  You know what I decided, Dr. Z? 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  I don't want you.  All right.  Now you try to do it.  Do you know what it's called?  Do you get me?  That's called paradoxical.  How are you going to get me?  That is called paradoxical intention in psychology.  I don't know what the fuck is called.  I don't know what the fuck is called.  In psychology.  It's called.  How are you going to get me?  It's called.  Hey, why don't we agree to disagree and let's start looking at boobies.  You are a ugly, beautiful woman and don't you ever forget it.  What is she on the scale now after all this?  She might, on her best day, a 22 and a half and that is it.  I like that you gave her that half point though.  So what you going to do? 
[01:06:00]  I'll give you up to a 24 depending on how charming you are.  I bet it's clean as a whistle too, doc.  Well, we would have seen her asshole if she didn't piss her off.  I bet everything's clean.  I bet it's just fucking ridiculously impeccable down there.  Yeah.  Not even a smell.  Yeah, right?  I bet you.  What do you think?  I bet you under your titties ain't even sweaty.  Jesus.  Guarantee.  I bet it smells like vodka.  Doesn't he have an amazing way of complimenting people? 
[01:06:30]  He has an amazing way of complimenting people.  Vodka and fish.  It must say it's a unique compliment, which is what I recommend in my book, Dr. Zee and  Safari.  See, you're covering all the bases.  Of course.  Look at it.  She is sexy though.  She's buying the whole thing.  What color are your nipples though, Biggie?  What color are they?  Yeah, like a little pink.  Yeah.  Delicious.  How big the clit?  Very big.  You got a big clit?  Like a little baby thumb?  Yeah.  I have a giant clit.  As a matter of fact, Howard Stern thought it looked like a mini penis. 
[01:07:00]  Is it really sensitive?  Yeah, he was a little intimidated by it.  Can we see it?  When my pet of the year lay out.  Is it really sensitive?  I'm going to have to get my pet of the year lay out.  Why?  Extremely sensitive.  Can we see it?  Really?  Well, it has to be aroused to be at its prime.  So do you like the tongue going back and forth or up and down?  Up and down, back and forth, you know, creativity.  Yeah, back and forth.  Because I'm very clinical with men.  I'm a two-thumb, open-up guy.  Good, good.  Here it is, right?  Nice.  Very nice.  And I'm very business-like. 
[01:07:30]  Can you stick out your tongue?  I want to see.  Because the length of the tongue is important too, actually.  If it matches my dick, it's a mess.  That's why good pussy, really good.  I do a lot of stuff to make you think you had a meal, and then I give you a small dessert.  Do you like for a woman to sit on your face?  That's important.  I can give a fuck.  You can sit anywhere you want.  Anywhere you want.  And you don't have to do much.  I'm a giver.  That's a good thing.  Would you sit on Patricia's face?  Actually, what...  You know, I talk about the book.  That in the book.  You know what?  The size doesn't matter as long as you can give. 
[01:08:00]  You know, most women get off on your tongue.  That's all they want.  They don't give a shit about your dick.  Delicious.  They want your tongue.  They want your tongue there.  I bet your pussy tastes like Chernobyl.  It tastes like...  What does Chernobyl taste like?  Pineapple.  Because I eat a lot of pineapples, which is the key to tasting well.  Lots of bromelain in it.  Yeah, lots of fruits.  I'm a vegetarian.  Lots and lots of fruits.  My girl eats a lot of mini burgers from Ruby Tuesdays.  What does that taste like?  That tastes nasty.  What does Sliders taste like?  There she is. 
[01:08:30]  That's her.  Patricia.  Vicky, Vicky, just slide that on.  Why don't you describe what you're going to do to me?  I want to hear your technique.  The guys want to know.  The guys want to know your technique.  My technique is very clinical.  I'm telling you.  I've lost all passion.  You take two thumbs and you slide it up either side of the lips.  That's good, sister.  And push it up until the clitoris is exposed.  And then you place...  Wait a minute.  I'm telling you now.  Do you expose the clitoris?  I'm going to tell you the fucking story.  So you slide it open and then you put your chin where the pussy hole is to rest it. 
[01:09:00]  And then stick your tongue in and back it...  In the side?  No, no, no.  On the clip.  On the clip, right?  On the clip.  And I'm a back and forth.  I don't do any up and down.  But what about some sucking action?  You got to add some sucking action to it.  Look, if you want that in your movie, you direct your movie.  In my movie...  That's what gets me off.  You come as fast as those men come.  And that's a guaranteed fact.  This is a fucking technique in over eight different countries, baby.  All right.  Except for yours.  I don't know. 
[01:09:30]  But I have been close.  I have been in fucking Holland.  Patrice, she wants to get off.  Describe it to her.  Read between the lines.  That's George Higgins from Florida.  What lines am I reading?  I'm ready to go.  Like, I'm ready for it.  She wants to hear what you would do to her.  I just told her.  Well, because I described specific techniques in my book, Doctors, You and Squaring.  So I want to know what kind of techniques you're going to describe in your book.  Give me...  I don't describe sex techniques because my thing is not about sex.  Well, how are you going to teach guys, though?  How are you going to teach them?  How are you going to teach these guys from Florida to get off?  My angle is not to teach guys how to fuck. 
[01:10:00]  My angle is to teach guys how to be happy when they're dealing with women.  That's all my thing is.  It's how to be happy versus this shit here.  It's how to be happy.  That's it.  I don't teach guys how to eat pussy.  Wait.  Do you realize that 70% of women out there do not have consistent orgasm because women,  because guys do not give them head.  I just told you how to...  I like eating pussy.  So you need to write a book about why guys need to eat more pussy.  It would be a one paragraph thing. 
[01:10:30]  I don't want to tell guys to eat pussy.  There's a lot of them who don't like and don't want to do it.  And then they complain that the women don't go down on them.  I'm into the trickle down theory.  That's all.  If I'm happy, then you'll be happy.  That's all.  That's very simple.  And that's the whole premise of my book.  But let me ask you a question.  Let me ask you this.  Yes.  I'm looking at you.  You really...  I do admit that even talking to you, I'm feeling reversed on my own thing.  I got all emotional.  Then I came down and it's like I'm feeling Dr. Z a little more than I felt an hour ago. 
[01:11:00]  That's why you guys should do a show together.  Yeah.  And can I just say...  So I grew on you.  You guys would probably have angry sex at the end of your radio show.  I was 22 and now making my way up to maybe 23 at this point.  And let me ask you a question.  She's insulted that you weren't higher in the 20s.  Let's be honest.  No, I'm not.  I mean, I said...  22 and a half.  22 and a half.  Listen, everybody's got their own prototype.  There's guys who couldn't even get it up for me.  I mean, I realize that everybody's got their own prototype.  Who couldn't get it up for you?  Yeah, I don't know about that.  Because there's guys out there who are into different types of women. 
[01:11:30]  There are guys who are into flat-chested women.  There's guys who are into muscular women.  I mean, I don't have the muscle.  No, let me ask you a question.  Everybody's got their own thing.  Is that possible?  And not because they said you did it before.  I would have wondered this in the first place.  I might not have asked you because you're Dr. Z.  But I'm asking Victoria.  I want to know.  How can you tell...  I just want to see if it's a good job or not.  Is that possible?  Just to see.  Because on there was fabulous. 
[01:12:00]  But it was all...  And all...  Whatever.  So after you saw naked pictures, Patrice, now you mellowed out.  Now you want to see my movies.  Yes.  You got me.  You just changed.  You got me.  I would love to see them naturally.  The angry Patrice is gone.  Now the sweep.  10 in the morning breasts.  I don't think he's asking for much.  They look very, very...  That's a great job.  Is that a mole?  They're beautiful.  Dr. G and Papa.  Is that a mole up there?  Yes.  Real mole.  Aw.  Not a third nipple.  Real mole.  They're not...  They're not real. 
[01:12:30]  They're slightly enhanced.  Slightly enhanced.  They're well done.  And where'd he go in?  Uh...  He goes in underneath.  No nipple?  You didn't go through the areola?  I don't recommend through the areola because it reduces sensitivity of the areola.  Fuck!  And...  Yes.  Don't do it through the areola.  Lily, what do you think?  I think they're really nice.  Dr. G and Papa.  I'm really jealous.  Can Lily squeeze them?  May I see the underneath part?  I'll touch them.  Can Lily squeeze them?  Wow.  Can I touch them?  Can I touch them?  Yeah, you can't feel... 
[01:13:00]  What is it?  Is it, uh...  It's like saline?  Uh, saline?  Yeah.  Under the muscle?  You can't feel them.  You can't touch them like they're...  That's not how you touch them.  You can't touch them like they're...  I don't know, man.  I don't know, man.  I don't know, man.  Why don't you just stab it with a fork?  Why don't you touch it?  Oh, man.  The correct way, yeah.  No.  No.  No.  Like, get the...  Wah, wah.  TJ, do you mind a man's...  How...  Patrice is not angry anymore.  No.  His anger dissipated like the morning fog.  Mm-hmm.  I just don't want to put no poetry, child. 
[01:13:30]  I just don't want to put...  I'm poetic, too.  I don't want to put any black fingerprints on that titty.  If something happens to you later, my fingerprints are going to be all over it.  Patrice is always thinking.  I love that black guy's face.  I always swear that, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Delicious.  Tremendous.  Little breasts.  So, where am I now on the scale?  I'm just curious.  Did I make it to 24 yet?  Dr. Z, this is really not fair.  We were getting the bestie.  You pull those things out, and now we're all calm. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, man, I'm shallow.  What can I say?  You guys are shallow.  It would have been...  See, I get impressed by your intelligence, by your quick wit, by your humor.  You guys are just impressed by that boob job.  Wow.  Exactly.  But it is...  It would have been interesting to see that entire argument between Patrice and her...  With her boobs out?  With her tits out.  Yeah.  Hey, Dr. Z, what's two plus two?  Mm, please tell me.  Because I love a girl that knows math.  It probably looks like Vietnam down there.  It's probably...  I can feel she's a little emotional.  Vietnam.  Yeah, there's some hemorrhaging going on, I can tell. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, my God.  She wasn't prepared to show anything.  That's why.  Oh, you think it's growing in a little bit?  Yeah, see how she looked up?  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to take a break and wrap up this show next.  Delicious.  We might be losing Anthony.  We might not.  Yeah, I got to go.  We're probably losing Anthony, but I'm going to stick around for Eastside Dave's ass fucking...  I'll listen.  I'm going to drive home.  Okay.  I would like to...  I think I have to leave also.  What?  Well, you're right.  I'll stay.  What am I talking about?  Hey, this is Patrice O'Neal.  You are listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[01:15:00]  I guess which is their best, really.  You know, when you think about it.  Opie and Anthony.  All right, we're back with the Opie Show.  We're pretty much playing last man standing.  I win today.  We lost Jimmy yesterday.  We lost Anthony today.  We lost TJ Miller and his mom.  They left as well.  Thanks for that.  Wait, what are you guys doing?  I'll show her a picture of my girls.  That's pretty hot.  She's pretty hot.  Would you...  He's trying to talk me into a threesome.  Well, what do you think? 
[01:15:30]  I got to see more pictures.  More pictures?  What?  That was a fucking great picture.  Yeah, that was a good one.  But she has some kind of mask on her face.  That was some...  Oh, wait.  Sorry.  She's got to show me a picture of a girl with a mask.  It was a great body.  Great figure.  Nice tits and everything.  What's the mask all about, Patrice?  Because we was doing some mask stuff.  We was doing...  We was doing mask stuff.  Here, look.  Look at this one.  I mean, a cat was like a...  God bless, Patrice.  Like a cat woman.  Oh, you're just doing some mask stuff.  Yeah, she's hot.  Not... 
[01:16:00]  I don't know.  It was a Halloween party.  And then here, like, I guess she's...  Like, what is it?  Dominating?  She's got, like, a little slave collar on her?  Yeah, but she's spitting in my face.  Let's look at that picture.  We're going to wrap up the show, but we do want to play something called Moment of Truth.  Now, you really would, like, fuck some guy in the ass with a strap on?  Sure.  Yeah.  Really?  I'm not sure I want to do it on the show, but I do enjoy doing it from time to time.  I've got a little bit of a dominant side going on, and you've got to switch up from time  to time.  Ladies and gentlemen, let's say hi to Eastside Dave. 
[01:16:30]  Hello there, everyone.  I just got in, and I heard something about him banging in the ass there.  Yeah.  By me?  Well, Eastside Dave, first of all, Ron and Fez, Noon to Three.  Oh, you're such a fucking bitch.  I just got in.  I was looking at you.  I just got in.  Ron and Fez, Noon to Three.  Ron and Fez, Noon to Three.  I just got in.  There's a ten-second rule with that.  Little known fact, I love the Ron and Fez show, and you were talking about maybe, you  know, getting it up the ass, right?  Yeah.  Well, I mean, no, no, no.  I said it's a fantasy of mine. 
[01:17:00]  Right.  By my wife.  Right.  I think I need to make that clear.  Okay.  He doesn't want to do it on the national radio.  No, I have no problem with that.  If my wife could be shipped in, because I just got a text message, if you get banging  the ass by that doctor, I'm leaving you.  And she's pregnant with his kids.  And she's pregnant.  And I never want to let down Mr. Opie here.  Yeah.  You know, so I figure if you want to.  You were supposed to be the grand finale of this fine radio show.  I know.  We had a great week of radio, and we're thinking, Eastside Dave. 
[01:17:30]  Getting banged in the ass.  Boom.  Everyone goes home for the weekend.  You know, I would love to get fucked in the ass for you guys.  But again, if my wife was the one doing it, I have some fidelity.  I don't want to let you down.  I have some fidelity issues.  You do have the strap on here, correct?  We have the strap on.  How about this for a trade-off?  Simulated.  And it's not cheating, really, because we got condoms and stuff.  And she's, it's not cheating if you're getting fucked with basically a belt.  I, I, she, my wife said, she'll leave me. 
[01:18:00]  What?  She'll leave me.  And she's not the one to say empty shorts.  Show them the strap on.  Show them the strap on.  Oh, I've seen the strap on.  Yeah.  And believe me, it looks, look, I'll gladly give you a trade-off.  What's the trade-off?  Because I can't interact with females, otherwise you can say it's cheating.  E-Rock puts the strap on on and it'll suck his dildo cock.  You want something gay?  I'll bring it to you.  Well, I don't think we're asking for something gay.  No, it's nothing to do with being gay. 
[01:18:30]  You kind of twisted that a little too much.  Put on the dildo, it'll suck your cock.  I thought you were going to say, I think I'm allowed a pinky from Dr. Z.  I didn't know I was going to go into this territory.  I'll take, take a pinky from any ONA male staff member.  No, well, or Patrice.  What are you doing, Pitts?  I don't know, E-Rock.  I'll put the dildo on if Dave wants to suck it.  I prefer an ONA.  But what does that have to do with it?  I was talking about a woman.  Yeah, she wants to fuck you in the ass with a strap on.  And she has a relationship too.  The guy has a beer belly.  I know, hey. 
[01:19:00]  I'm talking about enhancing male pleasure, about give and take, and about prostate massage,  and all that kind of stuff.  What does that have to do with sucking?  Would you accept a prostate massage?  A prostate massage?  Can we get your wife on the phone?  Maybe we can negotiate something.  You can try.  I'll give her the phone number.  Maybe I can get you a raise, I think.  I think I can get you a raise.  Listen, if she's going to do a prostate exam?  Yeah, it's officially a prostate exam.  Dildo in the ass.  Put the strap on dildo.  All right.  But at least you'll find out at the end if you have cancer or not. 
[01:19:30]  All right.  So I think we get something done out of this.  And I probably do have cancer.  Don't live a clean lifestyle, Mr. Opie.  What?  Oh.  Lily, what's the deal?  Are we going to get this done?  Are we going to get this done with Eastside Dave?  You'll get something out of me.  I'm surprised that E-Rock doesn't want a dildo.  No, it's cock suck, but it's E-Rock.  E-Rock.  No, that's not good enough.  Dr. Z was really hoping to fuck someone today.  Yeah.  I mean, you...  I was really hoping to actually do it to Patrice, but he's not up for it, I think. 
[01:20:00]  Patrice?  He's not up for prostate massage.  If you get naked and you step up to that level where you strap it on and you're standing  there naked ready to fuck somebody's ass, I'll do it.  But that's how much I bet you're full of shit.  Really?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  You would actually take this.  Look, I said what I said.  I'm not going to keep talking to you.  Interesting.  Interesting.  So, balls in your court, Doc.  Wow. 
[01:20:30]  You're ready to get fucked in the ass by Dr. Z.  You keep stalling, baby.  Go ahead.  So, all I have to do is get naked.  Keep stalling.  And put on...  Take your fucking clothes off.  Why are you taking your pants off, he said Dave?  What the fuck?  Are you getting turned on?  Get naked, strap on that dildo, and kabalow.  Fuck it.  So, shall we do it?  Patrice is the man of his word.  I'll tell you right now.  I'll tell you right now.  All right.  Then we'll do it.  All right.  Ready?  Yeah.  You have to get naked first.  That was the only rule. 
[01:21:00]  We got your wife on the phone.  Is she going to be mad?  Is she going to hate me now?  No.  I mean...  Get ready for the strap on.  She is what she is.  All right.  Dr. Z is getting naked.  Get ready for the strap on.  Get ready for the strap on.  See, Patrice doesn't believe you.  I mean, we've already seen you with your top off.  I can get naked?  You can get naked.  Guys are pushing their faces up against the glass.  This could be radio history.  What do you think so far there, Patrice?  None of these old lady fucking stockings is bothering me, but I'm going to see what happens. 
[01:21:30]  What is up?  I don't know.  Just regular stockings.  Jesus fucking Christ.  Oh, my God.  Patrice.  She's getting naked.  Patrice, get your ass ready.  I'm going to see this fucking...  Go ahead.  She's getting naked, Patrice.  Patrice, you don't think I can get naked?  Do you know how many times I've been naked?  Strap on and ready to go.  You got to get the strap on and everything.  Why do you got the pantyhose on?  Oh, these pantyhose are making my stomach hurt.  Because it's cold outside.  Is there a hole in your pantyhose right in your Ground Zero? 
[01:22:00]  No.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Okay.  What are you taking her stockings off?  Eastside, focus.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  This is good.  I lost all my guys.  I need some help here.  Get ready.  Okay.  All right.  Dr. Z is now down to some fine panties that match the bra.  Yeah, I told you.  But she's now losing the bra.  Patrice.  Nice leopard print.  Oh.  What do you think, Eastside Dave?  Well, they're large. 
[01:22:30]  Wait a minute.  We're not...  We're talking...  She picked up the belt.  This is my girl calling me right now.  See?  Now!  Now who is backing out of it?  Now who is backing out?  You just told me already.  Wait a minute.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  You broke your phone.  Oh, I'm sorry.  You broke your phone.  I'm only panty's away.  All right.  She's only panty's away.  Don't go nowhere.  Don't go...  Wait.  Did she do the panty's away?  Now, for the record, he just broke his cell phone.  He broke his...  Oh, fuck me.  Wait.  Don't go nowhere.  Keep going, man. 
[01:23:00]  I'm ready to fuck you.  Keep going.  Are you ready to get fucked?  No, he's calling his girl back.  Oh, my God.  No, forget about that.  She's just a vagina.  She doesn't really matter.  Remember?  No, no, no.  Yeah, she don't, but just...  It doesn't really matter at all.  All right.  Hold on.  She's on the phone.  You want to get her on the radio, Patrice?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  We're going to get her on the radio.  Yeah, because...  Eastside Dave.  Yeah, she's just a vagina, though.  See, you...  I can't believe it.  Fuck, I'll get rid of her on the speakerphone.  And she has to play along.  Remember, you are the one who are making the rules, right?  All right.  Get some headphones on. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  We got the lovely Casey on the phone.  Eastside Dave's wife.  And we're getting Patrice's chick on the air.  Casey.  I think Patrice's asshole is getting scared.  Hold on.  We got...  Get your headphones on.  We got to...  Wow.  E-Rock is actually sitting in Anthony's seat.  You are a brave man.  Eastside Dave, your wife's on the phone.  Hi, baby.  Hi, baby.  So, there's a doctor in here who's blonde and has a...  You know, she's a female doctor and she wants to... 
[01:24:00]  She really is a doctor.  It says it right on her book.  Dr. Z.  She wants to bang me with a dildo.  She's very pretty.  She wants to bang me with a dildo.  So, what's your stance on that?  Is that the infidelity or...  Does that text message of my bag's getting packed, does that ring true?  That rings absolutely true.  Oh, jeez.  You know why?  Let me finish why real quick.  I'm sitting here, bloated, crampy, carrying your fucking kid.  Oh.  Passing your DNA on.  Your parasitic DNA.  My friend is over here. 
[01:24:30]  My friend Chip is here.  And I'm not asking him to bang me in the ass in solidarity.  I really think that it's unfair.  So, you're trying to say that this would actually be a treat for Eastside Dave.  It would be.  That's the thing.  They were wondering, how about a prostate check?  Because she is a doctor, and that's just like a pinky, and it's honestly, that's just, you know, that's just a...  That's just checking my health.  Casey, you understand radio.  She's naked.  She's got to do something now.  Or she's not naked yet, though.  She doesn't need to go shoving her digits in my husband. 
[01:25:00]  But her pinky, just for her to check my prostate?  What the fuck?  No?  How about I make a deal?  I'll pal-talk my cam up, and Chip can put his finger in my ass.  Oh, nice.  That's a good trade-off.  That would be nice.  How does that make you feel?  Well, because you don't have a prostate.  Well, she can pretend.  You know what?  Why doesn't he check to see how the baby's coming along, then?  Oh, jeez.  All right, so I guess the answer's no. 
[01:25:30]  I'm still willing to...  Wait, you wouldn't consider it bad if I sucked E-Rock's dildo cock, would you?  That I would actually enjoy and think it's funny.  All right, we might do that.  All right, we've got to say goodbye to Casey, because now we've got Patrice's girl on the phone.  Patrice's girl, everyone.  I don't think she's ever been on our show.  No.  Patrice's girl, how are you?  Hi, everybody.  How are you?  Good.  Now, as Dr. Z was getting completely naked, she was almost completely naked, and she was reaching  for the strap-on to fuck Patrice in the ass.  Patrice's phone rang, and that would have been you, so now we've got you on the radio. 
[01:26:00]  Well, because Patrice is a man of his word, but I had to intersect because I'm not there.  And the only problem with her sticking something in his ass is I'm not there to stick something  in her ass.  All right, so that's the only problem, then?  That's the only problem.  So, I mean, we could all have a D, and if he still wants to stick to his word, that's  fine with me.  Now, have you ever stuck anything up his ass?  I don't think anything about his ass without anything going in your ass.  Now, have you ever stuck anything up Patrice's ass? 
[01:26:30]  No.  So you haven't tried it?  You don't know if he's really into it, or has he resisted his ass exploration?  That's not something I'm really interested in, so I just never went there.  Okay.  And I don't think that he's interested in that.  Well, you never know until you try.  Well, I'm going to get fucked in my ass right now, baby.  Hang up on him.  All right.  Hanging up on Patrice's girl.  There you go.  I listened to Patrice.  There you go.  All right, get naked, honey. 
[01:27:00]  Let's see what's going on here.  All right, so now you're down to panties, right?  So we'll find out if he likes it or not, right?  All right, Dr. Z, who hated everybody a mere hour and a half ago, is now completely naked.  And now she's attempting to...  Wow, you've done that before.  That strap-on went right on.  Okay.  Very seamless.  Yeah, she knew what she was doing there, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Fit like a glove.  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  What, what, Patrice?  White dildo?  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Oh, shit. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, fucking wait a minute.  A white dildo?  I don't think that's acceptable.  Well, we got black...  You didn't fucking say...  We got black condoms.  Wait a minute, but you didn't say a fucking black dildo, man.  What's wrong with the white...  Why didn't I say a white dildo?  What's wrong with the white dick?  Hey, I'm a white girl.  Dude, I can't...  I'm a white girl.  I can't...  If I had a penis, I wouldn't be a white penis.  This is a little weird, because now she's got the dildo on with the strap on.  You gotta go.  You can't back out.  Patrice's voice right here.  Shit.  You know.  You know what they're gonna...  You know that voice.  Come on, baby.  She... 
[01:28:00]  She's mad at shit, man.  She's mad at shit.  Sweetie, listen.  Hello?  First you said my pussy smell like mini burgers.  No.  Wait, what'd she say again?  She said I said her pussy smell like mini burgers on the...  You know I ain't getting fucked in my ass by this goofy bitch.  I'm just...  I just wanna...  I just wanna see her naked, man.  No, you are.  Oh, you're not a man of your word.  Oh, fuck it.  I lied.  What are you...  I lied, bitch.  What do you want?  No, you're just a pussy.  You just pussied out. 
[01:28:30]  That's true.  You are true.  You're a pussy.  Is your girl all right, Patrice?  Patrice O'Neal just admitted that he's just a pussy.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yeah.  Sweetie, I'm just a pussy.  Oh, she hung up on me.  He's scared of being dumped by his girlfriend.  He's scared of...  Yes, I am.  His ass being spoiled.  Dave's pants are down.  He's scared of having...  Dave, what are you doing?  What are you doing, Dave?  I thought I was gonna see some ass banging, so it was just for...  It was just for access.  Are you allowed to jerk off if she's making... 
[01:29:00]  Uh, I don't know.  Get her back on the phone.  All right, Casey, if you're still listening to the call back, we gotta know if Dave's allowed  to jerk off, because he's down to his, like, really awful boxer.  Patrice, Patrice, and I thought you were the man of your word.  That dildos...  I didn't know.  Is there a white dildos begging for you?  No, but it's very non-hard.  It's just gonna smush you against your ass.  I'm trying to figure out, at what point, how do I pull my pants down, bend over, and  get fucked in my ass by Dr. Z. 
[01:29:30]  Here's a black one just for you.  All right, guys.  Now look long.  Patrice, the black one's here.  I'd like to apologize for lying to you.  Oh, yeah.  Now you look awkward.  Now you're naked with a strap on.  I don't know when to fuck.  He looks awkward.  I don't look awkward.  I just, I just, I'm a liar.  I've lied before.  Okay, you're a liar.  And I apologize.  You're a pussy.  And God has forgiven me.  Hey, can we do something with Lily?  Oh, um, I don't want to get fucked in my ass. 
[01:30:00]  See, everybody just talk here.  You guys are just talking.  Noon to three.  Noon to three.  Noon to three.  It's a great promotion, but Ron and Fez, I'm thinking.  Noon to three.  I will say that you fucking stepped up to the plate, Jack.  I will say, you are standing there butt naked with a fucking strap on on.  Well, can we at least have you suck the strap on?  I'm not sucking a fake dick.  I will.  Not on her.  Now that I have a strap on.  Wait, you're allowed to?  You're not cheating?  Come on, Casey, you should allow that.  Get her back on the phone.  All right, let's get her back on the phone. 
[01:30:30]  Before I'm out of the studio, somebody's going to suck the strap on.  I mean, that really sounded like concentration camp shit right there.  How about we allow this?  Eastside Dave sucks Dr. Z's cock, and while it's in your mouth, you promote Ron and Fez.  And Patrice admitted his defeat.  We need some kind of finale for this week of radio.  Noon to three, by the way.  We only have 18 minutes left before the computer shuts us off.  Don't say you're a pussy, see? 
[01:31:00]  Yeah, yeah, I am.  I am.  I'm not taking a fucking dildo in my butthole.  You're afraid of the best orgasm of your life.  How is that?  I mean, we got your headphones on.  Hold on, hold on.  Your prostate stimulation, baby.  We got Casey back.  Casey.  Yesy.  Hi, how are you?  Hi.  Baby.  You know I love you.  Yeah?  Okay.  All right.  Baby, would I be allowed to?  Now, is that racist?  Why is the black one so much bigger than the white one?  Oh, come on.  You know the answer to that.  You've had a, you said you had hundreds of them. 
[01:31:30]  Actually, researchers showed there is no difference.  Yeah.  It's all in your mind.  Researchers were white men, she forgot to say.  No.  All right, Casey, how do we get this done?  What if Dave has his hands behind his back and Dr. Z has her hands behind her back, so  technically he's just sucking on a dildo that's kind of floating in space?  Again, I present you with the option that I do the same thing here.  Oh, Dave.  Chip sucking a dildo on you?  You brought home that strap-on.  Yeah.  Okay. 
[01:32:00]  Thank you for telling them that.  You brought home a strap-on.  I did, yeah.  Just for fun.  Oh, my God.  Not just as a joke, you know.  Everyone does fun little gags on their wives.  Dave, it looks like you're out.  I'm sorry.  I know you want to suck Dr. Z's cock, but I don't think it's going to happen.  No, man.  It's not.  And, Opie, you're always saying you want to take the gay out of the show.  Have Lily do it.  Ooh, Lily.  Come on.  Big grand finale.  No, no.  That's not.  That's fair.  See, I need a guy. 
[01:32:30]  My whole point is the prostate massage.  I'm trying to prove that.  The whole point is to destroy madness.  No.  You just shove something in somebody's asshole.  No, no, no.  My whole point is.  You've got a few Chernobyl moles, by the way.  I see another one on your side there.  Stop picking my moles and volunteer for the best orgasm of your life.  I can't.  I can't volunteer for an ass fucker.  See, now you guys are all pussies.  You were calling.  I never said Dave said he would do it.  I said I would do it with my wife.  The only thing that happens in poker when you call a bluff is you win.  Like, you won. 
[01:33:00]  You call my bluff and you get respect for that.  But I am not taking a dildo in my ass cheeks.  So we don't have anybody here who is willing to get an ass up?  Or to at least suck this strap on.  Or some interns that want to have a...  Big man's like, he looked back.  Come on.  The bald dude, he looked right back like, I know you motherfuckers ain't looking at me.  He looked right back and said, which one are you pussies?  Hey, my body looks pretty damn good on the camera.  What's the ass look like? 
[01:33:30]  Let me see.  It's high and tight.  Yeah.  I have a white girl's ass.  It doesn't mean it's not.  You are very...  Like, if I was a fucking white guy, I'd be mesmerized.  You got like a very white guy body.  Dave, put your pants on.  It's not going to happen?  I'll suck you at E-Rock's chocolate cock whenever you want.  Wow.  We're trying to do a little better for the grand finale.  All right.  So everybody puts you down here.  I guess it's got to be Lily.  I can't have my wife leave me.  Lily?  Oh, no.  No, but that's not fair.  Are there ideas?  I know somebody was trying to throw me under the bus, but no. 
[01:34:00]  I wish my girl was like in the vicinity.  If she didn't live like where she lives.  Really?  Well, we could set this whole scene up again.  Excuses, excuses.  Yeah, there's always that.  There's always part dough.  Yeah.  She's a soldier.  She wouldn't flake out like I did.  All right.  Well, Casey, thank you.  I'm sorry that we put you through this.  No problem.  I'm sorry to ruin your show.  It's okay.  Bye.  It's all good.  Motherfuckers, who was really thinking I was going to take it in the poop chute?  I had no doubt that you...  You weren't.  You fucking kidding me.  I wasn't right.  But my girl was sitting there going... 
[01:34:30]  The visual was hilarious.  She's like, motherfucker, I know you're not going to let this girl strap dildo for you.  You're out of your mind.  All right.  Go around the room.  Any takers?  This is how this ends?  This was supposed to be the big girl?  What is this?  This is like anticlimactic.  It really is.  In more than one way.  Anticlimactic.  Here's Dr. Z.  Dr. Z on Squaring.com.  Here you go.  What are you...  Dave.  Oh, Dave is doing it to himself.  Dave is doing it to himself.  Dave, why are you shoving the chunk in the dildo for you? 
[01:35:00]  You won a finale, baby.  Dave, what are you saying?  This isn't fitting.  Dave.  I am a white person.  So how does it feel?  It doesn't feel that good.  It doesn't feel the way I thought it would.  Because you're doing it to yourself.  You need some lube, okay?  Yeah, get some lube.  Oh, my God.  You're not...  No!  What are you doing?  Ow!  This is not how I picture this show ending.  Ow!  Dave.  Dave.  What is this?  Ow!  Dave.  Dave.  Ow! 
[01:35:30]  Dave.  This is not how I picture this show ending.  Ow!  Dave's...  Ow!  Dave.  Dave.  Dave.  Look at his tiny penis.  Dave is this big.  Look at his tiny penis.  His dick is this big.  Oh, Dave.  Patrice.  Patrice had pulled out the fake nipple to show everybody how big your dick is.  Oh, Dave.  Oh!  What, Patrice?  His dick is the size of a nipple.  Oh, it's Dave.  I can't get out. 
[01:36:00]  His dick is the size of Dr. Z's nipple.  Oh, my God.  Look at that, dude.  What did I do?  Oh, my wife was right.  Why is it hanging out of your ass?  Pull it out.  Just pull it out.  I don't want it.  You're hurt.  You're ruling out blood to lube.  Blood to lube.  What are you doing?  Why didn't you tell me that before?  Oh, that's just stinks.  Guys, that's what if you all need Dr. Z's nipple.  Run fast noon to three.  Run fast noon to three.  Wow, wow, wow.  And now this is the proof that my guys need Dr. Z on scoring.com. 
[01:36:30]  Something as simple as putting lube on.  Something that I need to tell him.  Now he's sucking on the fucking black dildo.  Come on!  Run fast noon to three!  Oh, God damn it.  Run fast noon to three!  Run fast noon to three!  Oh, boy.  God, no.  Patrice, now you feel sorry.  Look what you started.  The ultimate denigration of this man by himself.  I feel nothing.  Eastside Dave just did ass to mouth, basically, on himself. 
[01:37:00]  I feel nothing.  On himself, he just did ass to mouth.  Jesus Christ.  How does he get a girl pregnant?  A girl, his lovely wife pregnant with a dick?  His dick.  He is.  You're hung like an ankle.  And I am not a fucking problem with a dick guy, but Jesus.  Look, I am a grower, not a shower.  Okay.  Why do you got a bucket?  Oh, boy.  What's happening?  Some guys are growers.  I'm a grower.  I shoved it back in my mouth.  I got some shit particles in there.  Actual shit crumbs.  So what are you doing? 
[01:37:30]  E. coli is making its way down.  I thought I was going to throw up.  He's throwing up soon.  All right.  Why don't you throw the black dildo away?  Because now that's useless.  We can't do anything with that.  I was kidding.  Wow.  Lucky hair.  All right.  I guess, Dr. Z, you can put your clothes back on.  I mean, you guys are a bunch of pussies.  That's all I'm going to tell you.  I think we turned this whole thing around, though.  Pussies?  It started off a little ugly, but in the end, everyone had a good time.  I just shoved the black dildo up my ass.  Lily, any words there?  Pussy.  Ron and Fez, Noon to 3.  That's all I got.  Were you shocked by what you saw here today?  Dave, why'd you do that? 
[01:38:00]  Noon to 3, Ron.  Sorry.  All right.  Just trying to help out.  You know what?  Auction this off on eBay.  Dave, you finally impressed me.  You're going to be part of my trade.  Give me my pay.  Your coochies, you got a little nappy down there, too.  She said that last time.  She likes to grow it out a little bit.  I didn't get it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A lot of people are calling you a punk, Patrice.  Yeah, well, fuck.  I didn't take it in the ass.  That's white guy shit.  As soon as you said that, I'm like, you know, Patrice is brilliant because we finally  figured out how to get her naked. 
[01:38:30]  I knew you weren't doing shit.  Getting somebody to fuck.  How do I even get in that position?  I don't even know how to get into fucking an ass position.  What do I do?  Dude, if that happened, I don't think I could ever talk to you again.  Nobody could.  My girl couldn't.  My friend.  What the fuck is that?  How much shit would I talk if I took a dildo in my fucking butt cheeps?  My cheeps.  I don't even know how to say it.  My butt cheeps.  Butt cheeps.  He's speechless now.  Butt cheeps.  But guess what?  It's going to be on your mind now.  All right.  So what are we promoting today?  What have I missed out? 
[01:39:00]  Round of Fez, noon to three.  Round of Fez, noon to three.  You all right now, Dave?  I feel a little bit better.  Thank you.  So now you don't have to wonder about that anymore.  Yeah.  I mean, that was a fantasy that one of them we can just strike off the ledger after today.  Yeah.  Oh, that didn't feel good, Doctor.  Well, because you did lube.  There's only one word to describe it.  That's why you guys need DrZScribe.com.  With the hair, the blonde hair just went in there dry.  Oh, my God.  Just a dry fuck in his ass with a dildo. 
[01:39:30]  Good God.  And then he went to mouth.  Ass to mouth on himself.  ATM, baby.  ATM.  I'm going to tell you, your lower panties is making me physically ill.  I can't believe you have that unsexy of a bottom half today.  Yeah, why?  You don't like my stockings?  No, it's like almost destroys me right now.  It's freezing, I'm sorry.  Yeah, she's just trying to keep it warm.  Yeah, fair enough.  You know what?  Let me stop.  She's just trying to keep it warm.  You fucking antied up, and I pussied out, and you're right. 
[01:40:00]  I have nothing to say.  You're absolutely right.  I'm just fucking with you.  Are you guys getting along now?  I want to take home.  Would you go home with Patrice?  Would your man get mad?  He was.  She wouldn't give a fuck.  She'd just slap him in his face and tell him to shut his mouth.  Well, he has to impress me more than that, and right now I'm a little disappointed.  There's a possibility.  We don't play fake radio crap.  Is there a real possibility that Patrice can bring you home to his girl?  No.  All right, there you go.  That was honest.  No.  Racist.  No, it's nothing to do with racism.  I'd go home with Chuck Nice. 
[01:40:30]  James in Ohio.  Chuck Nice.  Mm-hmm.  You know Chuck Nice?  You would fuck Chuck Nice.  You're just saying.  Would you fuck Chuck Nice?  Would I?  Or have you?  I don't have to tell you that, do I?  He used to be part of our show.  Well, not part of our show, but he used to do our show.  Well, let's just say he's one of my very good friends.  The radio chick, right?  Oh, damn.  You had some Chuck Nice dick.  No, no.  I'm not saying that.  You smashed it, huh?  I'm not saying that.  You smashed Chuck Nice's.  Smashed it.  Hey, Dave, a lot of people are wondering if you pink socked yourself. 
[01:41:00]  What does that mean?  He had to.  You had to.  When you pull it back out, now it's looking like a pink sock.  Oh, yeah.  Some of the inside is coming out.  My asshole stretched.  Yeah.  He took it balls deep.  It hurt worse when I took it out than when I put it in.  What a trooper.  This nigga just stuck a black dill on his ass balls deep on his own.  Yeah.  That means he went past the threshold of pain.  Well, look, I want to help you guys out.  I'm a team player.  Ron Fesman, the three.  All right.  I appreciate it.  What is up on the Ron Fes show? 
[01:41:30]  Oh, we got a lot of topics coming up.  He has no idea.  No, but I heard you guys are going to do what?  Like an all-nighter?  Oh, yeah.  We're going to have a 24-hour party coming up very, very soon in the XM universe.  Stay tuned for that.  That's going to be awesome.  And what's her name?  Linnae?  Linnae, yeah.  It's a little girl.  Huge fan of Linnae.  I want to steal her from you guys.  Okay.  Huge fan of her.  We have her 8x10 in our office if you want to take her.  Well, not in that way.  I think she has some radio chops for her 11-year-old girl.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  All right.  What else are we doing? 
[01:42:00]  That's it, right?  Do we have to do line of the day?  Nothing's going to compare to a dildo up beside Dave's ass.  Well, maybe we should say who thinks that.  SkiColoradoNow.com for info on great deals on 26 world-class resorts and up-to-the-minute  snow conditions.  Log on to SkiColoradoNow.com.  Here is a runner-up line of the day.  Damn, bitch, why are you me?  I just told you the law.  I just told you to lose 25 pounds.  Oh, God. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, no.  A lot of people calling you a huge punk, Patrice.  I don't give a fuck.  Do they really want to hear you get fucked up the ass?  Like, what?  Like, what?  Did they lose respect?  Because I didn't take a dildo on my ass?  Well, go fuck yourself.  Fucking cock white 201 from fucking Connecticut.  They are really mad that you didn't live up to me.  They are really mad that you didn't take a strap on.  So they can just never, I can never have any respect for myself, but from a liar to a quasi-sissy 
[01:43:00]  that took it in the ass?  I want to say a couple things here.  Patrice, I've been encouraging Patrice to write a sex advice book.  Yeah, I think he should.  I think his take on things would make a great read.  I like his oral technique, too.  And it would actually be very informative.  The other thing is, he does a sex advice show.  Now, I don't want to blow Patrice's spot, but for one Saturday night, one Saturday night  only, you guys should team up.  That would be some fucking radio.  You might have fun, but she, she, she's goofy, I know. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, she's just, it'll just be like a regular girl.  She could be the girl, you know what she could be?  Huh.  If she's around April 5th, she could be the girl on the show.  Like, I always have a woman come in just to, just sort of shows.  Maybe she comes in for the last hour or something.  I don't give a shit.  I know, we'll figure it out.  Dr. Z's a friend of the show.  Yeah, she's cool.  Now she's officially done more than she did on Howard.  Well, yeah, it depends how you define it.  Next time I suggest a Bukkake party with you.  I think that would be nice. 
[01:44:00]  Well, Howard sold about 10,000 books for me, if you can do that.  Well, because he might have, he probably talked positive about the book.  Maybe we can learn from him.  Exactly, so I'll challenge you guys.  You sell that much and you don't know what I'm going to do.  If we sell 10,000 books, can we do Bukkake party with Dr. Z?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'll challenge you.  10,000 books, Bukkake party.  You lay down and we just have guys jailed.  10,000 books.  But you know what?  10,000 books.  You know what?  She has proven herself to not be the person that's bullshit. 
[01:44:30]  How much is a book?  It's about $15.  Oh, shit.  It's $14.95 US.  $150 G's.  And we're having a Bukkake party.  And I don't think she's bullshit.  No, I'm not bullshit.  Dr. Z coming soon to the O.P. and Anthony show.  Dr. Z on scoring.  Can't wait.  Jesus.  Dot com.  All right.  If she wants to sell books.  And suck cock.  Cocksucking bookseller.  So out there, if you guys are a fan of O.P. and Anthony, go out on Amazon.com. 
[01:45:00]  We got the plugs in.  Trust me.  And order Dr. Z in scoring.  Now we're going to plug you in.  Hey, this is Patrice O'Neal.  And to find out any dates, any information, anything you need to know about me, go to Patrice  O'Neal.com.  Or visit me at MySpace slash Tourist in Brazil.  I don't know why I did that.  I'm not that corny.  Somebody had stole my original MySpace and that's what he put like, cause that's how  he's, you know, he knew me from Brazil, but that's my shit.  You can't even change it now. 
[01:45:30]  Cause by the time I got it, it was already 8,000 friends.  This nigga had more friends than I got now.  Like, I haven't even doubled the friends that this fucking imposter did.  So if you go to MySpace.com slash Tourist in Brazil, you can get some information on Patrice  O'Neal.  And if you go to PatriceO'Neal.com, it'll tell you all the lovely little places I'll be.  O.P. and Anthony.  Now presenting comedian Jim Jeffries.  My mum, I had a friend commit suicide a while back, it sounds a cheery thing, but I had 
[01:46:00]  an argument with her before she committed suicide that day.  I rang my mum up and I go, I said some awful things, mum, and she goes, well, James, in  your life you're going to, you know, say hurtful things to people that you don't mean, but  you just try to, you know, minimize these things so they don't happen again, right?  And she goes, I'm just happy.  I've said some awful things in my life, but I'm just happy that I never said anything bad  to you or your brothers.  And I'm like, what did you do when you left the house?  Were you just like stabbing people in the street or something? 
[01:46:30]  Last time I was home, I got woken up by this 400 pound woman bashing into my room going,  I want you to know that when I'm dead, in many ways, you've been a huge disappointment  to me.  And the reason for that is, the reason for that is because I didn't show her some photos  and I showed them to my dad.  Oh, she's mental.  She used to beat the hell out of me.  I got scars on my, on my heel.  She used to hit me with a belt buckle from a scout belt, right?  Because I wouldn't go to scout.  The reason I wouldn't go is I was being molested every day I was there.  Oh my God. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, wow.  And she goes, why would you go?  I don't want to go.  Boom.  You must have been an adorable little kid.  Now it explains all the stories you told us yesterday.  Yes, it does.  Right, Jimmy?  Now we understand why you do what you do sexually.  One of my space messages, just a row of 20 when I got back to the hotel yesterday that  just said, gay.  Like nothing else.  Wait, you got molested at Boy Scouts?  At Scouts, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he never actually physically inside or anything. 
[01:47:30]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Yeah.  Well, was that all right, do you think?  Yeah.  Probably not.  He used to just put me in a corner.  Anyway, it wasn't a good day.  Either way you look at it.  It wasn't a good day either way.  Well, was he into just looking at you?  The thing is, he always wanted you to call him Baloo through the whole experience.  He never lost his seniority from the jungle book.  What did he make you do?  You got to kind of keep it sort of vague. 
[01:48:00]  But we'll figure it out.  A lot of swearing and sitting in the corner.  And it was like being in the front row at SeaWorld.  Oh, no.  Okay.  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.  Oh, God.  When Shamu flips up in the air and lands in the air.  Caution, you may get wet, is what they say.  Yeah, when Shamu.  That was the best way I could describe it on Boy Radio.  I thought that was pretty good, the way I danced around there.  Wow.  All right.  Oh, God.  So this was going on at Scouts. 
[01:48:30]  You go home, and now you decide, you know, it's in my best interest not to go back there anymore.  And now you're getting...  It was Cubs, actually.  And now you're getting beat by your mum.  Yeah.  Because you won't go to Scouts to get molested, basically.  Mum used to thrash me with the belt buckle of the Scout belt.  When the hell did this happen?  And those Scout belts, they're like those big buckles and everything. 
[01:49:00]  It wasn't nice.  In the end, my dad found out.  I tell this a little bit in my routine, but I'll mention it anyway.  In the end, my dad found out.  I swear to God, this is what he said.  He comes to me, and he goes, I went with my mate who it also happened to, and my dad said,  you've done the right thing by coming to see us, and I want you to know that you've done nothing wrong,  and he's done everything wrong, and he's going to get what's coming to him.  And then my dad hugged me and looked at me and went, I wonder how you got all those badges.  And people think I made that up.  Oh, wow.  But I swear to God, that's true. 
[01:49:30]  And the thing is, I respect my father so much for that, because I believe comedy is all about taking risks.  And my father was holding his molested child, and he thought, no, it's a good one.  Have a go.  Maybe I'll get a joke here.  I'm just going to let this one fly.  I'll just work it in.  Did you laugh?  No, I didn't really get it, but I can promise you, later on that evening, he was in the pub with his mates going,  and then I said.  Oh, yeah.  Let's say good morning to Cleveland.  We got Pete on the line.  Pete?  That is true.  Pete, what's up? 
[01:50:00]  Dude, that's awesome.  Hey, Jim.  Hey, guys.  How are you, buddy?  Hey.  All right.  I've been lingering longer, and there was, you guys were playing, I don't know, it was  when you were on vacation or something, they did a replay, and Bob Kelly was in the studio  with you guys, and he was talking about, he did this set, and there was this guy that  was in the waiting room with him that was, like, deathly afraid of something, and it turned  out it was Jim Jeffries.  This was a long time ago, and I guess you guys all forgot about it. 
[01:50:30]  Hmm.  What is he afraid of?  Bananas.  Oh, yeah, no, I don't, I don't like bananas.  In fact, there's a pill over there that I've already, how did you, how did you, no, don't  do that.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, seriously, it's open.  Don't, don't, don't screw with him.  Wait, what is this about?  He's actually leaving the studio.  I don't, I don't like bananas.  I don't, I don't like bananas.  I'm just holding up the, are you doing a bit?  No, I'm serious.  Put it back, Opie, don't make the guest uncomfortable. 
[01:51:00]  No, no, put it back, I don't, I don't like it when it's open like that.  Like this?  Yes, don't do that.  All right, what is going on?  Put it back and we will like, and we will ask and maybe there's an explanation.  Wait, this is like kryptonite.  Look at this, watch it.  No, don't, don't make our guest uncomfortable.  No, don't, don't, don't open up.  No, seriously, it's not funny.  Wait, do those, do those things open look like what a Scoutmaster's trousers look like?  All right, it's just got to.  Put it back, put it back.  Hold on, it's got to be said that I just, he, he saw my banana over here. 
[01:51:30]  I eat a banana and yogurt every morning.  This guy just said that he's deathly afraid of bananas.  And he pointed at my banana.  I picked it up.  I just started showing it to him and he's moved away.  How did that guy know I didn't like bananas?  Who told him about bananas?  I guess Bob Kelly had said it once.  Wait, this is a real moment.  What's up?  I have a thing with bananas.  All right, you're going to tell us after the break.  This is the tease right now.  Wait.  Who's turning off the channel right now?  It's the work of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:52:00]  If I shut my eyes, I can't see it.  So do what you want.  You can feel it though, right?  No, no, no, no, no.  Just feel the banana.  No, I'm not going to touch the banana.  Please, just feel it.  I'm not going to touch you.  Don't, don't, don't.  Why would you do that?  How weird is it though?  Look at him.  He just doesn't like.  People don't like balloons.  Some people don't like baked beans.  Some people don't like clowns.  I don't, I don't like bananas.  What is the, how does it make you feel when you see it though?  It used to make me vomit.  Now it's just like someone holding a spider to like an arachnophobe or something.  Well, it looks like a spider because it's all like. 
[01:52:30]  No, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  When it's open like that, it's like.  Why are you doing that?  Because it's an amazing reaction.  Leave him alone.  I've gotten better.  A year ago, I couldn't even be in this room.  In the room?  No.  You barely could be in the room.  You're like moving away from the mic.  When did you realize that there was this.  Ever since I was a child.  Again?  I never, I never liked it.  Wow.  You know what the banana represents?  Who are we kidding?  Who are we kidding?  He can't have a squirt gun with milk shooting out of his tongue.  Brr. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, but you're being very cruel.  That's his kryptonite.  He doesn't like that.  But you ever see, my problem is now, because he wrote Robert Kelly, he tells everybody.  And some guy in, I don't know, Wisconsin or something rings up and tells me that I don't  like bananas.  I thought it was a fairly well-kept secret.  And now there's going to be like people at the show tonight, just with a banana, just  sitting on their knee, just in the front row.  Have them thrown out.  Oh, yeah.  Have them thrown.  If you bring a banana, you will be thrown out of the venue.  I once, I once shagged a bird.  Want to say that word? 
[01:53:30]  Oh, sure.  Sure.  I once shagged a bird, and she put a condom on, and it was banana flavor.  But I didn't know.  And it was banana.  I vomited all over.  With that artificial, that artificial smell.  Oh, oh.  Gosh.  You don't even like the smell of banana.  So you don't like any.  I don't know the banana flavor.  Let's just see what happens.  Just hold this banana.  I'm not going to hold it.  I'm not going to hold it.  It just ain't going to happen.  Hold my banana.  Something happened.  Did the scalp.  No, no.  I was.  Yeah.  I know.  But I mean, is there a.  Was I molested with a banana? 
[01:54:00]  No, no.  By breakfast or something, where that smell, it's a visceral reaction.  My mom said even as a baby, I wouldn't eat, like, mashed up bananas.  Really?  I remember my brothers used to hold me down and mash banana into my head.  Oh, what bastards.  Yeah, but I didn't like it before then.  They would do that because you didn't like it.  Yeah, because it wasn't the cause of it.  They weren't mashing bananas into your head.  That's what they told your mom.  Your mom.  Your mom.  Your mom.  Your mom.  Right.  You have to do that. 
[01:54:30]  Opie, why are you being such an ass to our guest?  I'm just showing love, man.  We love this Jim Jeffries guy.  How would you like if someone brought a vacuum in and just started vacuuming around you?  Don't you like vacuums?  Bit over.  Bit over.  He hates vacuums.  Anthony figured out a way to make you stop.  Why wouldn't you like vacuums?  Bit over.  Bit over.  The sound of a vacuum drives him nuts.  Really?  Yeah, absolutely.  Nuts.  My mom would vacuum our house, I don't know, hours at a time, and we'd be watching TV and 
[01:55:00]  and when they found that out, listeners would start calling.  Lift your feet.  Listeners would start calling and over the phone just play them the vacuum sound and it  would freak them out.  Dude, I'm lucky.  Exhaust fans in like bathrooms, it's the same sort of sound.  No, it's just vacuums.  I'm lucky enough now in my life to have a cleaning lady and she comes once a week and she was  vacuuming the other day.  I had to leave the apartment.  Really?  I had to leave the apartment. 
[01:55:30]  All right, see?  Look what it does.  I love that sound.  It smells good.  That's my thing.  Yeah, I like that sound.  And just like you, I don't know why, it can't be just because my mom was vacuuming a lot  as a kid, but look at my arm.  Goosebumps right away from the sound of a vacuum.  Can I feel them?  Yeah, here you go.  Ooh.  You know what gets me?  You know the air hose on a compressor?  You use it to clean off, if you work in a shop, you use it to blow off sawdust or metal 
[01:56:00]  chips off a lathe or something like that, to put it a little too close to your arm and  hit the air and it makes your skin go like a little bit, that, I can't even deal with  that.  How often does that happen?  Well, you know something, when you're working in a shop, it happens a lot.  Right, right, right.  Yeah, because you're cleaning stuff up.  You used to do that?  And just the air coming out of the nozzle kind of gives me the heebie-jeebies.  I'm sadistic, though. 
[01:56:30]  I will do a bit where we get a lot of vacuums, turn them on all at the same time.  I want to see how many vacuums I can take before I actually have to leave the studio.  Because I will leave the studio eventually.  I don't think one.  The one makes the goosebumps pop up immediately in the hair on the back of my neck.  But, you know, and someone is reminding us, we're missing the obvious here.  What?  Maury.  Maury Fears.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, you would be perfect on Maury Povich.  Yeah.  Because he has people confront their fears, you know, to help them. 
[01:57:00]  Whoa.  Whoa, the banana's getting loose in my hand.  Don't.  Whoa, it has a life of its own.  Whoa.  Do you know something?  Whoa.  Stop it, will you?  Stop it.  Whoa.  This isn't even good radio.  Stop it.  People at home are already bored of this.  This is boring.  Jim has been nothing but a great guest on our program, and you're rewarding him by being  a douche.  I won't vomit or anything.  I'm all right.  My ex-flatmate put a banana in my underwear drawer, and I punched him in the head.  You punched him.  And I made him wash all my underwear as well. 
[01:57:30]  It's weird because you look down.  Like, you can't make eye contact with the banana or the person that is holding the banana.  You kind of look down and shy away from the microphone.  Watch.  Whoa.  Oh, would you?  Why?  It's that little flinch that a dog gets that you've hit a lot.  Yeah, yeah, that's exactly what you look like.  No, no, no, no.  Don't give it to me.  I'm actually just going to give it to me.  Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  You can't watch people eat a banana.  No, the whole density of the thing, and they chew it.  Jimmy, let's eat our banana.  And they chew it. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, my God.  Why are you doing this to this man?  Jimmy, we won't.  My mouth is getting the banana.  Oh, my God.  They're so...  They're touched on the banana.  I'd rather eat Big A's tongue.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I thought you said that.  Hey, Jim.  It's too thick.  No, see, look.  He's going to leave.  Don't leave.  See, he's going to leave.  He's leaving.  I'll be back.  Just finish your banana.  It's delicious.  Holy crap.  This is a real thing.  He just left. 
[01:58:30]  Dude, this is not fake.  He doesn't like bananas.  It's thick and banana-y.  Next time he comes to New York, we have to have a studio filled with bananas.  Of course we do.  Hundreds of them.  I had a smoothie yesterday, and it's, you know, banana, heavy banana and strawberry,  but it smells like banana, and he was kind of sitting, like, in the seat next to me.  I wonder if that was bothering him.  Oh, this sucks.  All right.  We like him too much.  Wait, let me finish my banana.  He's been a great guest.  You don't want to have him not come back.  I'm not having a hissy fit. 
[01:59:00]  I'll be back.  What?  I can't hear you.  Just finish the bananas.  Can you walk to that mic?  I can't hear you.  I'm not being a girl.  I just...  Oh, he's got the banana peel just cocked back in his hand like he's ready to heave it  at him.  You are so mean.  He's giving us such great radio, too.  Jimmy, are you done with your banana?  I certainly am.  Oh, hi.  Now, Jimmy's put the banana peel on his head.  Look, we'll make it fun. 
[01:59:30]  We'll wear them as little banana hats.  Okay.  All right?  It's all right.  Jim, look.  Look what I do for you.  No, no, don't.  No, I'm serious.  Don't dangle it, man.  What?  Even this?  I'll start swearing when we take it off the air.  You don't want this.  Leave him alone.  Do you like Jimmy's banana hat?  I like Jimmy's banana hat.  Yeah.  That is weird.  It's not nice. 
[02:00:00]  Jimmy, you got one of those things?  Mine is vacuums.  His is bananas.  His is air hoses.  You think I would tell you?  I have one and I would never tell you.  You got one?  Oh, yeah.  Is it an innocent thing?  Kind of.  Heterosexual sex?  Is it an innocent thing?  See, mine's...  Like the laugh of a small child?  Oh, I got something for you.  Thank you, fan.  Hmm.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone.  I have no word.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring. 
[02:00:30]  Banana phone.  You're holding it open.  So appealing for us to get together and sing.  Sing!  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone.  Ding, dong, ding, dong, ding, dong, ding.  Banana phone.  It grows in bunches.  I've got my hunches.  It's the best.  Beat the rest.  Cellular, modular, interactive, modular.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone.  You're a bastard.  I'm doing the dancing banana.  Yeah. 
[02:01:00]  Banana phone.  Pick a wine.  Woo!  It's no baloney.  It ain't a phony.  My cellular, bananular phone.  All right.  Jim.  See?  It's in the bin.  It's in the bin.  Listen, listen.  There you go.  All right.  Dead and buried.  It's in the garbage.  Did you get Norton's one as well?  I threw mine out.  Oh, okay.  All right.  We're okay.  I'm sorry about that.  And now people think I'm an idiot.  I have another one, but I do enjoy a good banana.  I like to eat them.  Yeah. 
[02:01:30]  I know people, too.  It's a superfood.  It's a superfood.  It's full of some vitamin that I obviously lack.  I have potassium.  You've never had a banana?  No.  No.  No.  That's so weird.  All right.  We've got Big A in the studio.  Someone offered me about $500 once to eat a little bit, and I vomited.  Well, could you do that for our radio show next time you're in town?  That would be terrific radio.  I would need much more money than that.  Would you ever take a gig?  That was when I was poor.  At Bananas in Poughkeepsie.  That's a funny question.  Would you ever take a gig at Bananas in Poughkeepsie?  I can handle the word. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah?  There's big bananas hanging.  It's fake.  Oh, yeah.  They're fake, but they're fake.  You can do that?  I used to have one of those blow-up bananas that you rode in the pool with.  Oh, really?  Like a pool pony, but I was cool with that.  Oh, okay.  All right.  So you're not completely insane.  It's just actual bananas.  I can't go to Queensland, though.  Up in Queensland, there's just banana plantations everywhere, and I have nightmares of, like,  walking through it, and the trees, like, attacking me or stuff.  They're not trees.  They're, like, what are they?  Like, bamboo-y type of things.  Yeah, banana, whatever they are.  If you were drowning, and the only way to reach you was with a banana, would you grab 
[02:02:30]  it?  What do you mean, the only way to reach me?  Like, you're just out of hand's reach.  Oh, yeah.  So you're saying, a banana, this is going to happen, is it?  The only way to reach me is banana.  You haven't got an item of clothing that you can chuck off with your hand.  You're naked.  You're only holding a banana.  You couldn't stick your leg out instead, which is longer than your arm.  You just had a leg's reach.  You had to put a banana.  It's a banana between his toes.  It's a banana. 
[02:03:00]  I love how this guy does it.  Yeah, no.  Jeffrey's rules.  I would tell you that I, that use your leg, or use your shirt, or something like that,  or I just, because then I know, even if you save me, then on the boat, going back to  the big boat, you'd just be baiting me with a banana the whole time.  That's true.  And that would be uncomfortable, going, who saved ya?  Who saved ya?  Just have to jump in the water again.  Hey, this is Jim Jefferies, and you're listening to the worst of the worst fucking, ah, fuck 
[02:03:30]  that one.  I'll do it again.  Hey, this is Jim Jefferies, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony, and if it's  the worst, it's going to be fucking shit.  Opie and Anthony.  Now presenting comedian, Rick Shapiro.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show, the O and A virus spreading across America. 
[02:04:00]  We got some nice guests, one on the phone, one in the studio.  You all right, Jimmy?  I'm really hurting my face.  I'm trying to pull my Breathe Right strip off, because the Daily News is taking pictures  of us as we walk, doing the walkover.  You don't want the Breathe Right on the picture?  It's humiliating myself in a newspaper photo, so I want to try to pull this off.  That is pretty funny when you end up in the paper, and you got that damn Breathe Right  strip on.  Can't you just pull it off real hard?  No, it hurts.  No, the skin will come off.  Really?  Yeah, it really hurts.  I thought it was like a...  It makes your eyes sparkle.  Yeah, it really brings out the color of your eyes, that blood red. 
[02:04:30]  I put this like an eighth of an inch below my eyelash, and I really put it too close to  my eye, it hurts.  Yeah.  You got to watch out for that, you know, where you place the damn thing.  Hey, let's say hi to Rick Shapiro in studio.  That's the voice you're hearing.  My buddy for like 10 years.  Yeah.  10 years, and of course...  Uncle Jerry from Lucky Louie.  That's right.  Yes.  And speaking of Lucky Louie, we got Louie on the phone.  Louie C.K.  Louie!  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey, thanks for having me on, guys.  No problem.  We got Rick in studio, too.  Oh, Rick Shapiro? 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, he's right here.  Hey, Louie, I need some favors.  I'll call you later.  You know what?  I'm going to be doing some stuff.  Yeah, you're going to be busy.  I know.  So what's up, man?  How are you?  Are we...  I just don't know.  Are we on terrestrial or satellite radio?  We're on both, but we're on terrestrial as well.  Yeah, so if you're going to curse, just, you know, keep it to a minimum.  I won't.  So they can understand what you're saying, that's all.  Yeah, like 11 o'clock we can...  At 9 o'clock we can...  9 o'clock, it's all out.  Where is Louie right now?  L.A.? 
[02:05:30]  I'm in Chicago right now.  Oh, Chicago, okay.  Chi-town.  L.A. would have been pretty early.  Chicago.  So we've got to start by asking, what the hell happened?  We all love the show.  The listeners love the show.  Yeah, well, here's the thing.  It had good ratings.  They were increasing every week, like they're going up every week.  We had a really devoted following, like real fans that loved the show.  And it had some bad reviews, but a lot of really good ones from really credible places. 
[02:06:00]  And so they decided to cancel it.  Well, that makes perfect sense.  Yeah.  What was the reason given, though?  Did they give a reason, man?  I don't...  I've actually got a really weird reaction from people.  Like, people are really surprised it was...  I got great audio of 4,000 people booing in Cleveland when I announced that.  That made me very happy.  But I don't think they ever gave...  Did they ever give, like, a real reason?  They certainly didn't tell me.  Yeah, four guys yelled at me on the street, too.  They were angry.  Yeah, no, people get really mad.  I mean, my job now is to break the news to people that the show got canceled.  Oh, that's got to be a fun phone call.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:06:30]  Well, I mean, everywhere I go, you know, airports and stuff.  Because people really...  People always come up and say stuff to me about the show.  And now they say, hey, when's the new one coming out?  And I go, it's not.  It's canceled.  And they go, no.  And I got to break it to them.  It's like, it's just a crappy job to have.  Yeah, they get pissed as hell.  They get really mad.  Yeah, they get really mad.  It's not the usual Will and Grace type of watcher.  It's guys who don't always watch.  Yeah, they're the ugliest people in show business all in one program. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  Like it ought to be.  If you found out that if you found out that Two and a Half Men got canceled, even if you  liked it, you'd be like, oh, okay.  I guess I don't watch that anymore.  Yeah, but they're not as passionate.  I mean, your audience was passionate for Lucky Louie.  What was the reason given?  Did they actually say something to you, Louie?  Not really.  I mean, every time that I talked to them, you know, while we were waiting to find out,  they said they loved the show.  And all the way up the chain to the top guy was like, oh, look, your show's really funny. 
[02:07:30]  Very few show these shows.  Very few of these kinds of shows are funny, and yours is.  And, you know, it's volatile, and people either love it or hate it, but that's usually a sign  that you did something really interesting.  I mean, that's literally, they just kept telling me, you know, those kind of things,  and then the words came around.  I was like, what?  Jesus.  Yeah, but nobody gives a crap about Two and a Half Men.  Nobody.  They don't give a shit.  It's just what they watch, and that's what they're given.  And people cared about this damn show, Lucky Louie. 
[02:08:00]  Like, they get really stupid.  Yeah, you guys know when you're in a bomb.  I mean, you guys are out there, you're doing projects all the time.  You've got to know when you're involved with something, you're like, oh, man,  obviously this is going to get canceled, but all right, I'll move on to the next thing.  But it seems like this Lucky Louie, I mean, this wasn't a bomb or anything,  and the passion was there, and you guys knew you were on to something.  So it's really got to hurt.  Yeah, I think that, like, are we saying it was all in the family?  But the bottom line is, I think as far as laughs are concerned, we earned a season two, 
[02:08:30]  and anyone that says it was the ratings weren't good.  That's what it annoys me.  I read on the message board, they just didn't have the ratings.  It's like you uninformed dumbass.  It's not the case at all.  Within demand, we were doing really well.  Well, I mean, there's no reason for people to know it.  It just didn't really come out because HBO would put the numbers out,  and the people that write stories in newspapers about television.  I just don't think that they liked our show, and I think they just chose not to print the stuff  because we had, like, about four million people a week, which is very good for a cable show. 
[02:09:00]  And it can't be measured against a show like two and a half men  because there's just plainly less people have access to HBO, you know.  So, but for a cable show, we measured us against, like, Sex and the City in its first year,  on Trush in its first year, and we're blowing them away.  We were doing better than almost any HBO first-year show.  And the fact that the ratings were going up week to week, that's just, you don't call that a failure, ratings-wise. 
[02:09:30]  Do you guys know what's going to replace you?  I don't know, actually.  Do you know?  Whatever it is, I hope it bombs miserably, and whoever stars in it dies.  There's better not be reruns of Sex and the City.  It's a beautiful sitcom about the Christian conservative stronghold over the vagina.  A beautiful show funded by Halliburton.  See, it's the government.  What's interesting to me is that The Wire is now the program that's on now.  That's the one that's in new episodes.  The Wire has, like, 100% good reviews. 
[02:10:00]  Like, everybody says it's the best show ever.  And The Wire has been on the air for several years and has this,  but they have the same ratings that we do.  They're not getting better ratings than us.  They're getting the same that we had after 12 episodes with no promotion.  Well, it's a risky concept, The Wire.  You know what I mean?  A bunch of black people dealing drugs.  I mean, who would have thought?  Jesus.  It's a frightening, frightening possibility.  But, you know, it's still safe because it wouldn't happen outside in your house. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  Not in mine, anyway.  I don't think it was just that the show – I mean, the thing is, the show made people really mad.  Some people, you know, it's not – we can't sit here and go, like, everybody loved it.  This is crazy.  But the fact is a lot of people hated the show, it's true.  And there's – but not as many as people liked it.  And the people that hated it, I think, had more –  Yeah, it's obvious.  More voice.  It's obvious this show found its audience.  So where do you guys go from here?  It seems like the show still has some life.  It doesn't feel dead to me. 
[02:11:00]  It just feels like there's still a chance.  There's – we have – you know, there's a petition online that has, like, 7,500 signatures,  which I don't know how many that is.  But, for instance, Carnival that went off the air two years ago, they have a petition and it's 17,000.  And so that's, like, a two-year-old petition.  And ours is about three weeks old.  So it goes up every couple of minutes.  I can't wait two years.  I don't want to wait two years.  And it's not that we're just bitter, like, oh, we were the greatest show ever, man.  It just really is kind of – I was shocked when they canceled it. 
[02:11:30]  Like, I kind of knew it because we hadn't heard anything.  And I'm like, man, I think laugh – for laughs, we earned a season two, man.  Yeah.  It was that kind of easy to expect.  Do you think all that male nudity sunk you?  You think that might have had something to do with it?  You should have let me get hard, Louis.  You should have let me get hard.  That was a huge choice.  That's how uncomfortable it was to see Rick naked, though.  Even the gays in Hollywood were, like, off the air.  They were running around their problems going, no, no, no.  No, listen, we pulled no punches on that show. 
[02:12:00]  You went for it, all right, man.  Male nudity for everybody.  That wasn't mine, though.  It was Alan Alda's.  Yeah, exactly.  Dude, how can people – look, I know people ask me, like, who can they call?  I always say, ah, call HBO, but it's a – I mean, I know that there's a way to get a whole – what are people supposed to do?  Because I honestly don't know.  Well, when I call HBO, there's just – you call the main switchboard number and ask for the guy who's the chairman, and you get him.  I mean, I feel reluctant to, like, give a phone number and a name because I'm going to get creeped. 
[02:12:30]  But it's not hard.  Well, I'll give his name.  It's common knowledge who he is.  You know, Chris Albrecht, don't be crazy when you call because, I mean, the guy did put us on the air.  We don't hate him.  I like him.  I mean, here's the thing is that HBO people say to me, like, you should be really mad at them.  But I'm not because they put us on the air and they let us do the show exactly the way we wanted to.  And they tried it for 12 seasons.  They never pulled us off.  12 episodes.  12 episodes.  12 seasons. 
[02:13:00]  Wow.  If that wasn't, like, a really deep-seated mental slip.  Yeah, no anger.  Sorry about that.  I can't believe after 50 Emmys, I mean, oh.  There were douchebags like David Bancouli at the Daily News saying, pull us off the air.  And they didn't do it.  They kept us out there.  So, I mean, and for me, this isn't about my personal grief because I've got, I'm doing a special for HBO  and I'm even developing other shit there.  So, I'm not, it's not me.  It's just that I feel horrible that this show doesn't, isn't still there for the people that love it. 
[02:13:30]  And I love working on it.  And Jim, you know, what is Jim going to do now?  It's over for him.  I know.  I really am finished.  It's like a little lost boy.  You really met me, didn't you?  Because you know I'm not busy.  Everything I touch falls into the toilet.  The first Opie and Anthony incarnation I was on, canceled.  A tough crowd.  Canceled.  I've been on Leno.  I'm sure he'll drop dead soon.  Everything I touch fails.  I am the problem.  All right, then I'm going to hang in there.  By the way, Jim, Pamela Adlon, the woman that plays my wife, you guys, she had a message 
[02:14:00]  she wanted me to give to Jim, which is that she hopes that a whore with AIDS pisses in  your ear.  Wow.  I don't think most of the commercial audience heard that, but.  It could happen.  It doesn't matter if she has AIDS or not.  It still burns.  One without AIDS is just as bad.  What's the difference?  That was very nice of her to say that.  Yeah, she probably did say that.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Did she give me a message?  Nothing, huh?  No.  All right.  No, no.  She's scared of you. 
[02:14:30]  Hey, Louie, will you come in when you're in town?  We would like to have you in, man.  No, definitely.  And I'm going to be in New York.  I'm doing a Trump marina in Atlantic City, so I'm coming to town to plug that stuff.  And if people want the show back, by the way, they can go to, there's a MySpace  page that has all the information of who to bother.  It's like, it's MySpace.com slash SaveLuckyLouie.  So that's where the petition is and all that stuff.  And you got the show coming out on DVD soon, right?  Yeah, January.  And you guys are doing the commentary and all that? 
[02:15:00]  I mean, Rick was supposed to move today, but did they move it?  They moved it.  To Monday.  To Monday, which I'm flying back from Cuba, so we may have to do it Tuesday.  But me and Shapiro are doing commentary for one of the episodes together.  That's right.  Dude, I love doing it, man.  It really was depressing when they yanked it.  Yeah, I can't believe it.  I hope people buy the DVDs, too.  It's funny, because the show's not perfect, and it's not even as good as I want it to  be.  We were still figuring it out, and there was stuff about it that made me frustrated.  But when I was doing the commentary, I was watching, I was like, Jesus, this shit is very 
[02:15:30]  good.  It's just really, you know, it's a very funny show.  There's a lot of laughs in it.  Who laughs at television?  Television's not funny.  It all sucks.  How many critics criticized it because the audience's laughs were too loud?  They're like, ah, they're using a laugh track.  It was so aggravating.  Yeah.  Yeah, to me, these are elitist fucking assholes.  Excuse me.  Terrestrial people.  Well, that's what I wanted to say.  The only thing it was HBO's chance to get rid of some of their pretentiousness, and they  balked on it.  Like, we can do Entourage, or Sopranos, or Upscale Mafia. 
[02:16:00]  I know Mafia guys.  They're a lot more fierce than the guys in the Sopranos.  Yeah.  You know?  And it was just unbelievable, man.  I know, but mostly I think they just got a lot of pressure from people that don't like  seeing...  To me, it's like, everybody wants to see a mobster swear or bury his head in a stripper's  ass, but when you see just an actually married couple having sex somehow, that's vulgar.  Like, half the people would say that it was gross, and half the people would say it wasn't 
[02:16:30]  sexy enough, but nobody wants people with kids to curse, or smoke cigarettes, or have  sex.  Like, if you have children, for some reason you're supposed to not...  You're supposed to just be...  And also, poor people are not supposed to be gross or have any opinions.  Right.  So I just think it was really...  I thought it was classist.  A lot of the stuff that I read about the show, I thought it was stupid.  That's the point, yeah.  I think people just missed it.  I mean, the episode we did that had a lot of sex, and it was about a guy trying to make  his wife come, and he finally makes her come, and now he has to do it every time, or else 
[02:17:00]  he doesn't get to.  Yeah.  Which, to me, is a really interesting story.  But all they said was like, well, why are this couple having sex instead of Jennifer Aniston  and Vince Vaughn?  Yeah.  They're the only ones that are allowed to get laid on camera.  Everybody...  Yeah.  Yeah, that's the point, man.  Well, in fairness, Lou, I was shocked.  There was one scene where him and Pam were having sex, and he jumped up, and credit where  it's due that you actually showed that on television.  Oh, my God. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, right.  I couldn't believe you allowed that to go over the air.  You know what?  I didn't care at all.  It meant nothing to me to show my penis to the whole country.  He's a professional.  It doesn't matter.  It was a turd fell out of your ass.  Big, man.  A whole bunch of them sprinkled out.  You look ridiculous.  I don't even know if people actually saw it, unless they had some sort of a freeze frame  and a zoom.  It didn't look good on TV, Lou.  No, it's not.  Yeah, you should have prepared it better, man.  I mean, do something.  You should have fluffed or something before. 
[02:18:00]  You should have dressed it up a bit.  I think I was easily the ugliest penis that's ever been on television, by far.  But I don't care, because my body, I got two kids, and my wife hates me, and my body  has no sexual value anymore.  Your stand-up, dude.  I envy you.  I love your stand-up.  It's so honest, and just about the misery of hating the kids, and it's not like stock  forced anger.  It really is like you want to just bash your children, and I love the way you address your  kids as if they're adults.  I mean, it's just really funny. 
[02:18:30]  I finally saw Louie at Caroline's, I guess, over the winter, and man, I haven't laughed  that hard in a long time.  Just real honest comedy.  This is what a good friend Opus.  He almost said, I never laughed that hard, and then he realized I'm a comic, and he's  seen me before.  Yeah.  Ah, you're...  He's my buddy.  You know.  Well, Save Lucky Louie is...  It's myspace.com slash SaveLuckyLouie.  So, dude, come in when you're in town, man.  I would really love to hang, and have you do the walkover with us from here to XM, because  a lot of what you said didn't go through, but I can't wait to read the dump report  once we get to XM.  Oh, my God.  It's going to be great.  It's going to be a lot of Louis C.K. tributes, but we got dumped. 
[02:19:00]  So, if you love the show, man, we appreciate everyone that loved the show.  Those of you that didn't like the show, I mean, I'm asking the fans to help out, but if  you didn't like the show, don't help out.  I mean, I understand it.  Just be honest about it.  Yeah, because fight for the show to come back.  There's people checking in saying they hated the show, but the point we're making here,  you know, everyone has opinions about what they like and don't like.  The point is, this show did find its audience on HBO.  It had really good ratings, and that's what we're getting at today.  Yeah, people that thought the show sucked or whatever. 
[02:19:30]  That's fine.  That's your opinion.  You're like something different.  Yeah, the people that thought that are soft, they're condescending and soft, and they  don't look at what's going on.  They don't want to hear the real shit.  I'm going to say what it is.  These guys are the biggest pussies I've ever heard.  Who would live like that?  I'm canceling my, that's what a woman said.  Who would live in that house?  Why don't you look out your goddamn window?  But who talks like this?  Who would live?  A cockroach wouldn't live in that house.  It's like, you're even inverted in your, you don't even know what you're saying. 
[02:20:00]  A cockroach would, you moron.  And they do.  And we got to put up with that voice.  Watch Entourage go, they're cute.  They put gel in their hair.  Just get out of here, man.  Hey, there you go.  I'm sorry, but it's fine.  I love you.  You're like crazy.  Yeah, man.  Another way to look at it.  Oh, man.  That makes me so happy.  I'm really looking forward to seeing you again, man.  And again, if you like the show, man, and you want to help us out.  And on opieandethony.com, we're going to put up just the main switchboard number, which  is not a private number. 
[02:20:30]  It's just a regular switchboard number for HBO that you can get a hold of.  And just be respectful of your call, because they did put us on, man.  And we do.  Yeah, you guys also, the stuff we had planned for Jim Norton is insane.  We wrote eight scripts that exist that we were going to shoot and that they paid us  to write.  And it's all, Jim Norton has all these great, like, we found out actually that if  he has emotional turns and actually gets involved, he actually becomes really hilarious.  Yeah.  You know, like when a little girl hurts his feelings and stuff like that.  Oh, God.  He's great. 
[02:21:00]  There's nobody like Jim in the world, thank God.  Yeah, Jim's character was developing nicely throughout the whole season.  The only person I kind of compare myself to is the obvious John Mark Carr.  But I wanted to do a nude scene so bad, dude.  I really wanted to be making this.  You would have.  We had a lot of stuff.  We had no choice.  It's all about male nudity.  I don't think that would have been difficult to pull off on the show.  And for my fan that's out there, you had me doing, I was going to do some good shit.  I wanted to say that because I'm not competing. 
[02:21:30]  I just wanted to say that.  Rick, we talked about the monologue you did at the end of one of the shows.  Oh, my God.  One of my favorite scenes.  Thanks.  We played the whole thing, I think, over at XM.  What was it again about having sex with old people?  Well, yeah, it was a drunk driving.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my.  That was one of the funniest things I've seen on TV, man.  Because you think it's going to be this cornball PSA about drunk driving.  Yeah, Louie, you tricked me because we did a whole thing on that.  We're like, oh, no.  HBO made him do this at the end of this episode. 
[02:22:00]  And then, of course, the spin.  Yeah, that's why I love Louie.  I mean, that's a great turn.  That's like.  That was a great turn.  There was a perfect parody of those crappy things you see at the end of real stupid sitcoms.  When they get edgy.  And they have to tackle in the special episode.  That fake responsibility and they don't even care.  Explain it for the people that didn't hear or see it.  The episode was about Louie and Mike are drunk driving and they get arrested for DWI.  So they're forced to go to an AA meeting and Uncle Jerry, who is Rick, is an alcoholic and he confesses during the AA meeting that he used to rob the old people that he was having sex with. 
[02:22:30]  And then at the end of the episode, it's all about drunk driving and alcoholism.  At the end of it, Rick comes out and says, I'm Rick Shapiro from the Opinion.  Hey.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I did it.  I'm in.  Talk about secret fears of mine.  It's my low self-esteem popping out.  No, it's a hope.  There's Rick Shapiro.  I'm Rick Shapiro of the Lucky Louie program.  And we covered a very serious subject. 
[02:23:00]  And you're like, oh, God, it's going to be about drunk driving.  We made fun of AA throughout the whole thing and just said that people that are really, alcoholics are really just a-holes with no judgment.  It really was just a great attack on such a, you know, a thing that hurts me terribly.  And Rick came out and just said the important subject was having sex with the elderly and then gave reasons as to why you should sleep with old people.  Yeah, they're, what is it, they're fun, they're appreciative, and hey, you don't have to use condoms. 
[02:23:30]  But the main reason, they're not dead yet.  That's what it was.  The biggest laughs I remember from the show was that one, was that at the end of that, because that took everybody so completely off guard and Rick walking out naked at the end of that episode.  Oh, yeah.  That's the biggest laugh I've ever seen anything get.  Rick is a performer, and that's why we had an audience there.  It would have been boring to do this show as a single-camera snooty show where you don't get to hear people actually laugh at it.  Yeah, yeah.  I love the horrified reaction.  The mixed reaction was amazing, the quiet, the laughter that extended because they kept being surprised in their crazy minds. 
[02:24:00]  But I want to say, like, what you said about opening up Norton's character and doing all that great stuff, that's what could have happened the next year, is that you had Laura, Pam, you, Mike, Jim, me.  You know, so much where it could go so many different places that these sitcoms or regular shows just don't go.  You know, it's just so stupid.  Well, I'm sure you guys must have taken the comparison to The Honeymooners as a compliment, you know? 
[02:24:30]  Oh, yeah, no.  I mean, look, when we built the set for the show, I got the blueprint for The Honeymooners set and used it as a place to start.  The whole idea was to let it feel like a show that's just really basic and that's just a couple standing in a kitchen yelling at each other.  No couch to lay back in and look like Jagger.  Right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  And I love the idea that, you know, you think you were in charge and it was, you know, the wife, you know, no matter how much you thought you were getting one over on her, she was just slicing you apart. 
[02:25:00]  You know, that kind of stuff is just great, man.  No, Pamela Adlon was just really funny and she was a real person.  Did you really get to see her naked ass?  Oh, well, she was wearing kind of a songy thing, but pretty much without looking straight right into her anatomy.  Yeah, it was, you know, that was very enjoyable. 
[02:25:30]  Dude, when you drop a C-bomb on her in the argument, it's like that's the way people argue.  It's like you start about something innocuous and stupid and the next thing you know, you've wrecked your weekend.  You drop the C-bomb and then you try to make up and you call her that again.  It's like that's the way people argue.  I've been in relationships and it's like that's what I look at.  And what guy hasn't been through that?  Every guy knows they have that as a weapon.  That's the atomic bomb that changes the course of the argument.  Oh, yeah.  And every guy who's ever dated a woman certainly wants to say it every five minutes.  I mean, all right.  I don't know.  I would have had trouble. 
[02:26:00]  I just hear white noise and shut down and stare beyond the girl.  Well, us guys, we had to come up with that word because, you know, we just know that they're more intelligent than us.  And we get frustrated like, all right, we need something here, man.  It's true.  And there's no equivalent because when women call us a dick, I'm proud to be called that.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  I never thought of that.  We got a break, man.  Come in when you're in town.  And, you know, obviously, well, let's see what happens with this.  Either way, I mean, obviously, thank you for putting me on your side. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah, Louie.  Amazing.  You guys have been behind us from the beginning, and you've been great.  So, thanks a lot.  I really appreciate it.  Hey, Louie, I got to tell you something.  Now that this project didn't work out for you, you're probably going to do another project.  You're going to need new faces.  You know.  Done a little acting ourselves.  We've done a little acting.  We've got a TV commercial out there.  Screw these guys.  TV commercial.  It almost worked.  Let's try it with some new faces.  What do you think?  Well, you said you had a break coming up, right?  Yeah.  Did you have a break?  Yeah.  All right, Louie. 
[02:27:00]  Continue success, buddy.  Thanks, man.  See you, Louie.  All right, Louie CK.  Bye.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  We've got Rick Shapiro.  You hanging, Rick?  Yeah, yeah.  We've got to talk about Madonna before 9 o'clock.  Got to congratulate Louie.  I believe he will break the dump record for the show.  What is the current record?  I think it was Leary.  Dennis Leary.  Dennis Leary.  11 or something, maybe?  Yeah, something around there.  One of the listeners will know.  Yeah.  It's the worst of the O.P. and Anthony show.  I used to work there. 
[02:27:30]  Where?  Where?  No, I was a hustler, you know.  Everybody knows that.  In the meatpacking district?  Well, it was on East 54th, but there was a little club called, I don't remember the name.  There was a place, yeah.  Actually, not everyone knows.  No, you don't.  We have a lot of listeners all over the place.  Well, hello, Nebraska.  Yeah.  Welcome to my world.  There's people in Nebraska listening.  Do you want to, like, expand on that or no?  I never screwed or got screwed.  See, I just heard about the dumb things, and I'm going to beat me myself. 
[02:28:00]  You can dance around it.  You can dance.  Do a little dancing.  You can just stay kind of up to it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What were you hustling?  I was looking for 60 bucks or a taco, and I just, you know, you got me on that one.  I think he was trying to move on, but I mean, you know.  What goods were you dealing in?  I was selling my, the thing that would have won me an Emmy on Lucky Louie. 
[02:28:30]  Ah, there you go.  Okay, so he was selling his manhood.  Yeah.  And, uh.  Yeah, I was real bad at giving, uh.  Well, there's really no way to say that.  All I ever heard was, get up, I'll do you.  You're worse than my wife.  Actual story.  You're worse than my wife.  Because I pretend.  I did it like it was the operation game.  Ooh, you came, stallion.  I guess I am being myself. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, did any of that make it?  I hope.  Of course it did.  Oh, my God.  That is a laugh right there.  I got a million of those.  Get up, you're worse than my wife.  Oh, my God.  Boy, you know, if it isn't bad enough, then you got to hear that.  You hate to do it to begin with.  I felt pretty good about it.  What are you telling me?  I felt pretty good about it.  You're damn right I'm worse than your wife.  Let's go get the real thing.  Live from your heart, man.  At least tell people why you were doing it so they know that. 
[02:29:30]  I was a Republican.  That's why.  You want to know the God darn truth.  Gee.  I may have lived a foul life, but no foul language.  At any rate, as the Republicans say.  You know, I didn't have a drug problem.  A part of me did.  Yeah.  And I was seeking salvation from a pimp named Rings and Things.  No, I don't know.  What was the drug of choice?  They smiled at me.  And I come from a family that was mean to me.  They smiled at me. 
[02:30:00]  Right.  So I ended up, I was broke, and I ended up eating dinner in a gay restaurant with my last  ten bucks, and then they descended and paid for the meal.  So I tried that all the time, and eventually I, you know, ended up on my knees one night.  Oh, jeez.  Is that graphic?  Is that why I can't sleep at night?  It's close to graphic.  I don't know.  They'll take care of it down the hall.  I guess I had a drug problem, too.  Yeah, what was the drug of choice?  Everything.  Second alls, two-in-alls, cocaine, heroin. 
[02:30:30]  But I smoked heroin, never shot it.  But I feel like this is an AA meeting.  I don't know.  All right.  We can move on.  Isn't that great?  I love how you...  Pot, whiskey, tequila, Southern Comfort.  Or, uh, I did a little tie stick once.  I don't know.  Yeah, it's okay.  All the ones.  Lyquil Cosmetics and NyQuil.  I liked how...  I even sniffed tube socks.  That's terrible.  I just made it like a cheesy thing.  And folks, I even...  I liked how it was like an awful situation, and talking about how, you know, you're pretty 
[02:31:00]  much selling yourself for this, but then you had to justify the whole, you know, heroin  to it.  But hey, I smoked it.  I didn't shoot it.  Like, that would have made everyone go, oh, after all that, oh, he shot heroin.  Well, that guy is a little...  Wow.  I'm just tired of junkies walking up to me like, did you ever shoot it?  Did you shoot it?  So now I don't have to have that conversation anymore, because they go, I was a little open  Anthony.  I knew you never shot it.  I'm moving to Miami.  Everyone knows my name. 
[02:31:30]  You know, that kind of conversation.  You just have to justify the fact that I never smoked crack, but I free-based cocaine.  Yeah.  Which is like a complete difference.  You're like running a laboratory in your house with ether and ammonia, and you're shaking  things and mixing it up.  You feel like a scientist, and then you need the little eyedropper, and you've got to go  through the top layer to the sediment that's in the middle, and get it out, and put that  on a slate, and then it dries white, and you scrape it off, and put it in a bowl. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, but it's the sweetest taste of smoke.  Coke would just burn.  Yeah.  It's the sweetest taste of smoke that ever coiled around your soul.  Your eyes popped out.  Your dick dropped off, and all your problems solved and questions answered, until it's  over, and you just begin again.  But then, the second hit of the night, never as good as the first, the third hit, never  as good as the first, and then you spend the whole rest of the night trying to get that  first one, and it just never works. 
[02:32:30]  Never, never.  Thanks for reminding me.  I forgot about that.  It just doesn't.  But then people are like, oh, you smoke crack?  It's like, no, crack.  What do you think I am?  And then I'd use a racial epithet, and then I'd say, no, it's free base.  You know, free base.  I'm a class act here.  Yeah, and as long as there's a girl in the Catholic school uniform waiting in the next  room.  You can have a nice date.  Yeah, whatever works for you.  Whatever keeps you going back to her.  It was really uncomfortable watching you two bond over cocaine.  I know, her eyes.  Over cocaine. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  It was that time.  It was, you know, it was the 80s.  I was going like this.  80s.  Everyone was doing it.  The 80s.  Come on, that's my excuse.  He was mimicking every with his hand motion.  I know.  I was.  I used to be able to mix it up pretty good.  Yeah, you were good.  And the guy at the science store is wondering why I'm buying ether and ammonia every weekend.  Be like, I need more ether and ammonia.  I'm still trying for that new rocket fuel that's going to solve all our problems.  He's a driven man.  Yeah.  Trying to get a new gas for the cars out there. 
[02:33:30]  It's a new fuel.  It's going to be amazing.  I'm an entrepreneur.  Yeah.  I've got a thing with my Bunsen burner called, get that girl to sleep with me.  Give me those ribs, you.  All right.  My dad needs some more 151 and a pipe.  Yeah.  They'll sell it to you.  Back in the old days.  Toby and Anthony.  The Anthony Show. 
[02:34:00]  Hey, the girl's your daddy home.  Don't go in.  You're all alone.  You're all alone.  You're all alone.  You're all alone.  I'm a queen.  You're all alone.  What are you saying?  You're all alone.  Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire. 
[02:34:30]  Sometimes I'll come in life.  Ah!  Since I'm in the room, too.  Ah!  Ah!  Tonight I wake up in the light.  Turn around and shut up.  Me.  If I was dying.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
[02:35:00]  It's the best of the worst of the comedians of B.O.B. and Anthony's show. 
[02:35:30]  Just hilarious. I'm sorry. Really funny. Really awful, too, by the way. I'll acknowledge that.  Holy mother of God.  Now presenting comedian Pat Cooper. 
[02:36:00]  He hit a line track. He thought for sure it was a doubling. He made a great catch.  And 56 in a row. And when Pete Rose started to come close, Joe was going to the arena.  Putting a fucking hex on him. He didn't want to break that fucking record.  You know, he was a very selfish kind of guy. But what a ball player.  Same with Mickey. Mickey was always bomb. He'd go to his fucking restaurant.  He said, I guess you want another picture. I said, what the fuck? Give me an oil painting. I want a fucking picture.  And he'd have it here. And he'd turn it around. I go, here. 
[02:36:30]  I said, give it to the kids. Kids are in awe with you guys.  Just in case you're wondering, Pat Cooper hasn't stopped talking since we went to break.  Oh, fuck you now. You want me to go home?  The great Pat Cooper in studio today.  I ain't coming here. I'm going to come next year.  The last time we saw Pat Cooper was at his fine roast. The boys did a good job with you, Pat.  Huh?  Yeah, you might want to put those headphones on.  I'm deaf anyway.  Yeah, I know. But we amplify the audio through the headphones and you're good.  No, the roast. We were there.  I know you were there. I appreciate it. I love you for it. And I thank you. 
[02:37:00]  I'm still shocked that I got a roast.  The boys did great.  I got news for you.  Yeah.  Now I'm going to be the Grand Marshal of the Boxing Hall of Fame in Canastota, June 7th.  Nice.  That to me is a big fucking thrill.  Of course.  I'm going to be the Grand Marshal, get them to meet all these boxers.  Everyone, Carmen Basilio, every fucking fighter that's alive, fights from all over the world to go there.  It's a great two-day weekend.  I would love to go there.  Canastota. It's great. I mean, every fucking great fighter that's alive will be there 
[02:37:30]  because it's a great, a big prestige.  Ollie won't be there, Ollie.  Ollie, you know, but that's another thing. I look at this guy, I want to cry.  And then I see George Foreman, who he knocked on his ass.  Yeah.  Walking around making 90 million fucking dollars a minute.  With his stupid burger cooker thing.  Yeah, he's a millionaire.  I mean, Ollie made boxing when it was shit, you know, really going down.  I mean, this guy had a pair of balls.  And to beat Foreman, smart.  And to get thinner, he's Parkinson's disease.  He's punch drunk. 
[02:38:00]  Foreman was an adult.  Who do you think was the greatest fighter of all time?  Ray Robinson.  Wow, that was quick. Why?  Oh, man, I saw him. I was a kid, man.  That guy was fucking with both hands.  I mean, did you see the great fight I saw when he was on his way out?  He fought Gene Fulmer and a six-inch left hook knocked Fulmer fucking flat.  And Fulmer said, why is he dancing up and down?  The guy said, he just knocked you out, you fucking asshole.  That's a fact.  Ray Robinson with a seven-inch, six fucking inches. 
[02:38:30]  Wow.  Hit him on my left hook.  I mean, nobody knocks Gene Fulmer out.  This guy was right ahead of a granite.  Six fucking inches.  Flat.  Wow.  What a great fighter.  Willie Pep, another one.  The only guy to win a round without landing a blow.  How did that happen?  Very simple.  He ran.  What the fuck do you want?  Here's a guy showing artistic in the ring.  But how do you win the round if you don't throw a punch?  Because the guy couldn't touch him.  So the guy throwing the punches were missing.  Don't question me.  It's in the records. 
[02:39:00]  One round without throwing a punch.  He just popped.  Bobbing and weaving.  So because he was bobbing and weaving, and the other guy was swinging and missing, he loses the round.  How about Lamada?  Did you ever see him fight, Jake?  Did you ever see Lamada fight, I mean, he knocked Ray down.  I saw him on tape, but Lamada was a fucking animal.  See, see this guy, he's not going to be, what's his name, caught through?  Randy, Randy.  He's not going to be like, fuck, Lamada.  Lamada would turn around and take him.  Give a fuck, Lamada was a fucking maniac.  But a fighter.  I mean, he turned around and said, hit me, hit me. 
[02:39:30]  And Ray finally stopped him, and he went to Ray.  He said, let me tell you, you asshole, you couldn't knock me down.  Four fucking times, he called.  Five times, he couldn't knock him down.  Never knocked me down, Ray.  Never knocked me down.  I love Raging Bull.  One of my favorite movies of all time.  Hey, Pat, you were talking about Joe DiMaggio.  Oh, we are now.  We've been on for, what the hell do I know?  I don't know.  You told me to eat that slap that you called up food.  It was yogurt.  Yogurt.  You eat yogurt?  Why not?  You know, something about a suck on a straw.  You're out of your mind. 
[02:40:00]  What's wrong with yogurt?  It's like what comes out of a cock.  Yeah, right.  Thank you.  That's fucking yogurt.  I don't know what this guy likes.  He likes macaroni.  He's going after yogurt now.  He likes macaroni.  All right, Joe DiMaggio, what can you say about him on the air?  Because some of the stories you were telling off air were great.  Great ballpark.  But Joe was not a nice, nice, you know, outgoing.  One time I said, Joe, would you sign a bat?  He says, no, I don't sign bats.  I said, would you sign a tree?  And he went, what does that mean? 
[02:40:30]  I said, forget about it, Joe.  Forget about it.  He wouldn't sign a bat and he knew you?  He wouldn't sign nothing.  Were you good friends with him?  The only way I got a ball, I didn't ask.  I would sit down and we'd be talking.  Me, Tim, and a couple of friends.  And he goes, I guess you want a ball, Pat.  And I said, well, Joe, I really, you know, I didn't know what to say.  I'm not a collector.  So he signs to Pat Cooper.  Joe DiMaggio, I take the ball.  About a month later, I meet him again.  He goes, I guess you want a ball.  I said, how many fucking balls are going to take you, Joe?  I got one ball.  Now I got two balls.  I wound up with five balls and I gave them away because I gave them to kids.  And I told the kids, with your thumb, get my name off, rub it. 
[02:41:00]  That's the truth.  I says, what?  And they got the thing.  I don't collect.  I work with the biggest stars in the world.  I'm not a collector.  I'm embarrassed.  I say, Frank, would you give me a fucking picture?  Right.  I don't ask.  The only way I take a picture with Sinatra, you had to ask me, Frank,  Pat, can I have a picture with you?  Otherwise, forget about it.  That's why nobody takes pictures with me.  Jimmy, that's a biggie, right?  A picture with Frank Sinatra?  Oh, yeah.  I get pictures with everybody.  I love it.  I always ask.  Well, that's good.  I'm not against that.  I don't have the patience to ask.  I go, I got nothing.  I work with Ginger Rogers.  Who comes in opening night? 
[02:41:30]  Cary Grant.  So Ginger Rogers calls his partner, come in.  I want you to meet Cary Grant.  So I turn around.  I go there.  I'm in horror of this guy.  And he's going, you know, you like your work?  He's giving me that shit.  You know, I said, do me a favor.  Stop doing fucking Cary Grant.  I said, can you do James Cagney, for Christ's sakes?  Stop doing Cary Grant.  He says, you're very fast on the uptake.  On the uptake?  What the fuck does that mean?  I don't understand.  But that's, that's...  It is Cary Grant that he's like, stop doing Cary Grant.  Yeah.  That's the fucking humor. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, that's hysterical.  That's called fucking humor.  I mean, what's the matter with you?  He's laughing at it.  I'm laughing because it's hysterical.  Yeah.  Only you.  But that's my sense of humor.  That's why I never made it bigger.  Is that it?  That's all right, though.  That's the truth.  Fuck him, man.  By the way, huh?  Fuck him.  Hey.  Fuck him for not making you bigger, Pat Cooper.  I respect everybody.  Just don't break my balls.  I ain't looking to be any bigger.  I made a nice piece of change.  I'm happy.  Yeah.  I do what I want to do, and that's it.  Where the fuck am I going?  I told him I was old when I was 40. 
[02:42:30]  Then nobody wanted to listen.  It's fucking over.  Guy said, what do you do for a hobby?  I rehearse dying.  That's what I fucking do.  What do you do for a hobby?  At 80 fucking years old, what do you do for a hobby?  You're 80?  I'll be 80 in a year.  Wow.  Guy said to me, you know, he says, you know, you look good for 79.  So let me tell you something.  I'd rather be 40 and look old.  How the fuck does that grab you, pal?  I look good at 79.  How about Sinatra?  You worked at Sinatra, right? 
[02:43:00]  I worked at him, and very strange.  You know, this guy, everybody thought he was Jesus Christ.  A lot of tough guys thought he was, you know, that's my man.  I said, this guy's a great entertainer.  He can't walk on fucking water.  I mean, he's going to die like everybody else.  What are you making?  You know, but it's like talking to a wall.  People really idolize, idolize.  I don't idolize anybody.  I respect people, but to get to a point of being the biggest fan or being a collector,  it's not that I don't respect these people.  It means nothing to me to save. 
[02:43:30]  Because when I die, you think my kid's going to go, Dad, you're going to leave me the Sinatra picture?  Or you're going to leave me?  I'll leave you a cock.  I'll leave you the fucking money.  You don't want no fucking pictures.  Where's the fucking money?  That's the name of the game.  That's what they're going to save.  You think my kid's not their age or my grandkids go, oh, how was Perry Como?  They don't give a fuck for Perry Como.  Well, you understand, right now they're turning around and they don't know where the fuck they're going.  All they do is they're on the fucking computer, can't find the bathroom.  What does that tell you?  So what the fuck good is that?  See, we have common sense.  We're the last of our era. 
[02:44:00]  After we're gone, this fucking country's going in the toilet.  It's over.  Yeah, it is over.  I told you.  What happened to my fucking thing?  Did I break it?  Okay.  Hey, one of our favorite things is when you talk about your father taking those amazing dumps.  He was a real man.  Well, my father believed.  We love your father stories because when you're not here, Anthony kind of imitates you doing father stories.  Well, Anthony should do something.  He hasn't done a fucking thing anymore.  I've just been sitting here admiring and respecting Mr. Cooper. 
[02:44:30]  That's what I do.  I listen.  And he's Italian like you.  Why are you going after him like that?  I don't go after nobody.  I have a love for people.  Because you know something?  You're never too old to learn something.  And I'm sitting here next to Pat Cooper.  And I respect the man.  God bless you.  And I respect you people, too.  And I think it's very important.  It's very important to have character.  And my old man believed that.  He says, when they take your dignity away, he says, you're better off dead. 
[02:45:00]  He says, because you're nobody.  My father says, when you have a zipper in front of your pants, act like a man.  Otherwise, pee in your pants.  And I used to listen.  And my old man, my old man talked with his neck.  He kept going, you know, I want to tell you, buddy.  I said, how the fuck you eat soup?  Because I thought I was here.  I swear, I never knew him to talk with me when I'm gone.  So where are you going to go?  Everything all right?  But that style is over.  Yeah.  Those are the true people. 
[02:45:30]  He was a man's man.  Oh, man.  My old man was a bricklayer.  He was like a fucking artist.  When you heard, ah, you know that was my old man.  Fucking sparks came out of the bricks.  He had confidence in his work.  I was the fucking worst.  I closed bedroom windows.  Instead of phone.  Yeah, it's yours.  Oh, Pat's got a call.  No, no, I don't call it.  I don't.  I don't.  I got to shut it off.  What the hell is this?  It's God.  He always bothers me.  I get a lot of unavailable.  I get a lot of people that I want to know if I want to buy this, buy that. 
[02:46:00]  And I said, oh, buy my ass.  I'm finished.  When I lost my wife three years ago, I put all my eggs and my grandkids and my, that's it.  That's the fucking end of it.  That's reality.  That's not bullshit.  You're going to get nothing, you understand?  You're going to kiss my ass.  I'll leave nothing in the fucking will.  The day my wife died, a week later, got a lawyer.  Give him every fucking thing.  He said, well, don't you want some of yourself?  Fuck me.  Give it to him now.  Who wants to hit him later?  Give it right there.  Yeah.  That's reality.  You're passing on and they're good kids.  They're going to do good.  They want to go to college fine. 
[02:46:30]  They don't want to go to college.  I don't give a fuck.  I don't give a fuck.  It's nice to love your children and nice to love your grandkids.  But they got to understand, I'm on my last leg.  Don't fucking tell me what to do, where to go and when to do it.  You understand?  I went to the doctor for a fucking examination.  I'm an A1 shape.  And then he says to me, you have ED.  Now, I thought it was cancer.  He says, you have erectional dysfunction.  I says, what do you mean?  He says, well, you can't get a hard on.  I said, well, I haven't tried. 
[02:47:00]  And this is the truth.  He says, did you try Viagra?  My alter God.  I tried Viagra about two weeks after he told me that.  I'm in front of the fucking mirror waiting for this thing to rise.  So he calls me.  He says, how are you doing?  He says, you got to have a girl, you stupid fuck.  What are you doing in front of the fucking thing?  And that's how dumb I am.  So he gives me a needle.  My alter God.  It's called PCP or BB.  PCP.  He took a glove and he puts my pecker in his hand.  My alter God.  And he injects it with a little, like he pricks the prick. 
[02:47:30]  And I swear to you, I go in another room and I wait 10 minutes and this thing starts to rise.  My alter God.  He comes in, puts another glove on.  I take the fazool out.  He looks at it again.  He goes, wait another minute or two.  I'm wearing jeans.  I should never see my green kids again.  And I got scared.  It started to push against my jeans.  Now I can't get the fucking thing down.  And he comes running in.  He puts another fucking glove on.  And he's turning around.  He says, calm down.  Calm down.  And he puts ice cubes.  And he says, what the fuck are you doing to my pecker here?  He says, Pat, sometimes that happens. 
[02:48:00]  What if I'm all alone?  And the fucking heart, I don't want to go down.  What am I going to call my fucking neighbor?  What am I going to do?  He says, you call 9-11.  9-11.  My pocket can't go down.  Are you fucking stupid?  How much for the service?  1,500 fucking dollars.  I said, wait a minute.  I gave the 1,500.  I gave the 1,500.  I said, okay.  He says, now here's how you do it.  He gives you a dildo and it shows you how to inject your gags in there.  I said, okay.  I go home and I said, I'll wait a couple of days. 
[02:48:30]  Stupid me.  You need a girl.  I'm not taking it.  I get a fucking needle and I put it in my fuzzle.  Okay.  Now it's laying there.  And it's laying there.  Nothing.  I call this fucking bum up.  I says, hey, my thing ain't.  He said, Pat, you need a girl.  I said, how come when I was in the room with your fucking thing, there was no girl and my cock went up.  Are you working on different medicines, you crap bastard?  So what did I do?  1,500 dollars.  I threw the shit out.  You did?  I threw the shit out.  I said, what am I fucking pushing 80 years old? 
[02:49:00]  I ain't got a fucking broad.  What am I going to do?  What am I going to do?  But you know, that's the fucking dumb ego.  I had all my sexual fantasies.  That's yesterday.  There's no more.  Fortnite right now is a big thing for me.  Passing gas is wonderful.  And if it lasts long, I cry emotionally.  Because I know the fucking belly is working.  My friend says, when you go every morning to dump, it means that the engine is working.  So when he says, when you do that, you are alive.  And he's right. 
[02:49:30]  Right.  And he would leave no smells, I remember, from your last visit.  No, no, no, no.  You don't.  When you eat the filete pumice, it just keeps it clean.  So we're not looking for smells.  We're not looking for nothing.  When you go every day, the engine is, who the fuck is Jimmy?  What are you calling up here?  Tim Norton right here.  Huh?  Well, about, Jimmy, make sure we all smell his farts.  But you're looking, it's not wrong with your eyes, you're looking over there when you're  talking to Jimmy.  I don't know.  You, uh, well, you know, you need a girl, obviously, but you're saying fantasies and  stuff.  Maybe you take care of yourself if you.  No, I can't. 
[02:50:00]  How can I do a masturbation if it don't go up?  It's like masturbating a fucking mushroom.  Give me a fucking break.  You could go back to the doctor.  Maybe pay him a little more than $1,500.  It is what it is.  It's fucking dead.  You should masturbate.  Hey, in front of the computer with some of that porn.  Let me tell you something.  I say it on the stage, buddy, and I tell everybody, when you can pee, do the sign of the cross,  you're fucking lucky.  I says, peeing is an art.  I've got friends of mine who have prostate problems.  They have to pee at an angle. 
[02:50:30]  They wouldn't give a fuck.  Just water comes out.  I said, so after this show, we're all going to go and pee.  That's what we're going to do.  There's 800 of you out there.  Let's go fucking pee.  That's better than sex.  That's better than normal.  Rather than if a guy probing your ass and probing the things with fingers and telling  you got a prostate.  Who the fuck ever knew I had a prostate?  All I knew, I had two balls and a thing hanging above the two balls.  That's all I knew.  All of a sudden, they got names, prostate.  I want to pee.  That's my fucking pleasure today.  Have you ever got a finger up the ass from the doctor? 
[02:51:00]  No, no, no.  I had a guy, the doctor, they called him the finger.  This guy, he practiced, he said, the best way to touch and to fear for prostate is with  the finger, not the blood shit.  He says, I'm from the old school.  And that's what he would do.  And now he can't.  He has arthritis in his fucking right hand.  How the fuck can he put his finger on my ass?  I'll get a thrill.  I can just see that finger mingling in my ass.  But that's what they did years ago.  And you know something?  They're starting to go back with the old ways these doctors were. 
[02:51:30]  I mean, a fucking guy come over to the house years ago with a black bag.  He said, what's the matter, Paddy?  I says, I got a pain.  He says, rub it.  And your mother gave me chicken.  We had no fucking money.  He did that for 40 years.  His name is Perdue.  It's a true story.  Bada boom, boom.  Oh, my God.  How about a massage from a girl?  I don't want nobody touching my fucking body.  I was married 42 years.  I love my wife.  I hug her.  She goes, you want me to work?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[02:52:00]  Leave the fucking body alone.  It's in good shape.  Are you embarrassed me?  She goes, no.  Am I doing okay?  She says, yeah.  What the fuck?  It ain't broke.  What are you trying to fix it for?  I don't want no massages.  So one Christmas, she brings in, you know, Adele, a muscle-bound fucking broad.  And she says, this is a merry Christmas.  Your wife wants you to get a rub down.  And I said, you put your fucking hands on me.  I'll stab you with a fucking knife.  She looked like a Nazi, this fucking broad.  She had a tattoo on her tongue called E.D. Joe's. 
[02:52:30]  E.D. Joe's.  E.D. Joe's.  So I don't like that.  I am, listen, I am what I am.  You like me, you like me.  I don't.  I understand.  But that's what it is.  I don't want nobody.  I don't go for that fucking shit.  I'm just nice.  I like to dip the bread in the macaroni.  Oh, yeah.  I come in my pants when I eat a fucking dish of pasta.  I guess the priorities change a little over the years.  But in your younger days, you must have, you know, really been, of course, the ladies  man.  Wait, wait, wait.  Were you the ladies man?  Anthony, Anthony, I swear to you, and I don't lie to you.  I've tried every fantasy that I wanted. 
[02:53:00]  And after you find out the fantasy is more important than the actual act.  Yeah.  It really gets us.  I got two broads.  Hey, baby.  I got three broads.  I want nine fucking broads.  You're full of shit.  I had two fucking broads one time.  They go, pa, I couldn't get it up.  I was fucking dead.  Dead.  Dead.  They said, you all right?  Dead.  Get a fucking doctor.  They left.  Those they left, they went up again.  So what the fuck good is it?  Sorry, what is it?  Hey, what's your favorite restaurant in New York?  What's your favorite New York restaurant? 
[02:53:30]  Oh, I got a lot of them.  Don't put me on the spot like that.  How about one that you like to eat or two that you like to eat?  He's going to say Patsy's.  Patsy's that good?  He's got to be a Patsy's guy.  I got a lot of fucking reds.  I was the one last night.  The first time I went to a place called Bella Blue on 70th Street in Lexington.  And they come out with the fish, you know.  And the guy said, Pascal, hey, where's the fish?  You look at the fish before we cook it.  I said, I don't want that fish.  He goes, why?  I said, just looking at me.  I don't like a fucking fish looking at me.  And I'm sitting in.  So I said, calls the chef. 
[02:54:00]  Listen to this.  And the chef says, he's not looking at you.  He's looking at him.  He's looking at him.  But this is what they do.  So you pay for the bullshit.  I was in Italy twice, okay?  It's bullshit.  The greatest food on the planet is in the city of New York.  I'll challenge anybody to tell me otherwise.  If you can't get it in New York, you can't get it nowhere.  You go to Italy there.  They got there.  They don't know what the certain flavors that we have here.  We got 200 pasta flavors, for Christ's sake.  You know, the only thing good about them, they'll sell us the pasta. 
[02:54:30]  You know, so they say, now that's going up because they say there's a shortage of flour.  Why?  Very simple.  Now they want to make gas out of corn, which means we can drive, but we're going to starve  to death.  So what the fuck?  So what the fuck good is this?  How sick are we?  In today's paper, they said there's a 40% rise of rice.  Who the fuck eats that shit anyway?  I don't give a fuck.  There's a 100% raise.  I don't eat that shit.  As long as I don't fuck with my pasta and my tomatoes, because that's the national flour  of Italy, the fucking tomato. 
[02:55:00]  You take tomatoes away from us, we fucking close the country down.  I'm telling you that, because you know what tomatoes have that thing called testosterone.  Sure.  Testosterone.  Yeah, that's in a tomato?  Oh, no.  That's what's keeping you fucking alive, because tomato is absolutely a fruit.  It's not a fucking vegetable.  We know that.  But the Italians, you know, something hit us one fucking day.  It's still in the vegetable section, though, in the supermarket.  It always is, because we're not that fucking brat.  You put it in the apple section, they won't buy it.  They can't come in and actually put it in the fruits section.  No.  No, of course not. 
[02:55:30]  Pat, there's no way you're 79 with all this energy.  Well, when I leave here, I lay down.  And I'll get up Saturday afternoon.  I don't know what it is.  I really don't.  I'm going to attempt to have an actual conversation with Pat Cooper now, instead of just doing  what I'll say himself.  Let me tell you something.  It hurts me, because I've tried to talk, you know, very nice, distinguish, and people  say, Pat, are you all right?  Yeah, what's the matter with you?  It's the truth.  Yeah.  You bring up a really good point, though, because when my dad was getting older, we were still  trying to get him to, like, exercise and eat right. 
[02:56:00]  And finally, we realized the guy lived his life, and he still wants to eat his fucking  chicken wings.  Leave him alone.  Leave him alone.  When you hit 70, it's not time to make, you know, changes in your life.  You know what my philosophy is?  You see these kids who have bad diseases, 8, 9, 10 years old?  That's my favorite charity.  Those kids may never have a chance to be 50 or 60 years old.  So when a guy's 50 or 60, you want to put him into training.  Why?  He wants to look good for his wife or for some broad? 
[02:56:30]  That's fucking stupid.  Do the best.  I don't say come to be 300 pounds, but by Jesus Christ, I used to be 137 when I stopped  smoking.  I ran up to 190, and I used to eat those cigarettes, but I stopped smoking.  You know, now I turn around, and I'm about 190.  I got a little bit of a belly.  I love it.  Look in the mirror.  I go, God bless you.  You're a good-looking mother jumper.  You're fucking good.  I look in there.  I look at my penis.  It's just hanging there like this here, and I go, what a fucking life ahead.  See, that's what it comes down to, and I think younger people don't understand 
[02:57:00]  that.  When you get to, like, Pat Cooper's age, you've lived your life, and you don't  want younger family members or people telling you you need to eat better, you  need to exercise, you need to sleep, go to bed at a decent hour.  You've done it, man.  You just want to live the remaining years like doing your thing.  I didn't expect to get this far.  People says, my God, you got, you know, with my attitude, but my wife, she said,  I don't know how you don't get killed, because I say some things that people  want to fucking break in.  I said, they're going to hit me.  I'll fucking own them.  What am I going to do?  What do you want to hit me for?  If you beat me with your brains, I respect it. 
[02:57:30]  If you raise your hands to me, I'm going to fucking own you, because that's  that.  I don't go for that shit.  I don't fear, and sometimes you should fear, but I don't fear.  I know my limitations, and if it gets into that, I back away and say, hey,  hey, I'm right, but that's okay.  Let's forget it, and I'll take a powder, because who the fuck wants to need that  guy?  My age.  I didn't fight when I was 31, 32.  I don't fucking mess up fighting, you know.  But this is what's wrong with a lot.  You've done a lot of stuff with, like, wise guys.  You've done a lot of partying with a wise guy. 
[02:58:00]  Ever?  Did there ever a problem?  Yeah.  No.  I used to know.  John Gotti, okay?  Yeah, I know you do.  I know John Gotti.  Seems like he was a great guy.  And we had a thing.  We had a thing.  Uh-oh.  We had a thing.  He would come into a restaurant, maybe with a couple of things, and I'd get up.  Hey, John, how many fucking times I told you, you mentioned my fucking name  one more time.  I'm going to fucking blow my stack.  He'd go, Pat, please, don't stop.  Don't give me that shit.  Gravano goes, who the fuck are you?  Am I talking to you, Sam?  Am I fucking talking to you?  Oh, shit.  I'm sucking. 
[02:58:30]  And I go, sit down.  So every time, John says, every time you see me in the restaurant, I'm at Taramino's.  Come on, Brad.  And fucking guys will look at me.  I just remember that.  You're like, what are you, a lunatic?  Well, no, you know.  But now people started to realize.  Oh, they know.  Well, did you know, Sam?  Well, when they saw you the second time, they knew it was a joke.  Because you wouldn't have been there after the first.  No, but I set that up.  And every time, I mean, every time it happened, people looked at me and say, how can you talk  because I don't give a fuck who he is, what he is, or where he is. 
[02:59:00]  You know, but people, after a while, they finally know.  But that's my sense of humor.  What the fuck am I going to start with these guys?  How about Sammy?  You knew Sammy the ball, right?  Gravano.  I just finished telling you.  No, I'm fucking Sammy.  I'm fucking back.  This guy can't fucking hear.  But I mean, you, you, I guess you're right.  I just wanted a little bit.  Oh, God.  Here was my question.  He was more dangerous than John Goddard, in my opinion.  In my opinion.  But he knew you were kidding, too.  Well, no.  At the first time, he looked at me, and then John went, Sam, don't fuck with this guy. 
[02:59:30]  And I think, you know, then they started to realize.  But then all the wise guys I knew, they were, hey, Patton, you need anything.  I tell you, many times I go in a restaurant, they weren't there.  My check was picked up, and I wasn't looking for that.  Right.  But, you know, this is the kind of, this is an Italian thing.  It's sad that.  It's an Italian thing.  It's sad that they're shutting down the boys.  Now, you see this finger here?  Yeah, yeah.  You take this finger away from the Italian.  We, we, we, we can't, we can't do nothing.  This is how we order.  Nicky, give him another one.  Sal, Sal.  Joe.  You know, it was like a fucking computer.  Taddle, give him one.  Give him now.  If the bartender gave you, and he didn't get the finger, they'll smack him in the face. 
[03:00:00]  He goes, well, you and this, no, no, no.  I told not him.  You, you, you, you.  Yeah, right.  It's an Italian thing, but there are levels of Italians, levels.  They're the wise guys, Italians, then you turn around.  They're people just go to work, Italians, and they're Italians who don't want to fucking  work.  They're Italians who don't want to be Italians.  So it's the same shit with the black people, with the, with the Polish people.  Except for the working part.  When they took away the.  Oh, oh, oh.  It's a joke for God's sake.  Can't you make jokes? 
[03:00:30]  See, you shouldn't talk because you get in fucking trouble.  Yeah, I know, you know, this day and age, this day and age, before we take a break and  continue with the great Pat Cooper, 79.  It's amazing to be honest with you.  Thank you.  Hector V from Georgia writes, Oh, you got to tell Norton that Jimmy Schubert was on  Ron and Fez yesterday and he used the phrase, put his meat shank in her prison pocket.  You like Schubert, Jimmy?  We like Schubert.  We really do.  We, we liked him so much.  We had him part of our comedy tour, which we would love to talk to you about. 
[03:01:00]  I think we're doing a few dates.  Let me ask you a question.  My only problem today is, and you know, I, I don't know most of the comics around the  younger guys.  It's not that I don't like him.  Jimmy's been around.  He used to be part of Sam Kinison's posse back in the day.  I understand that, but I'm just going to be mid forties at this point.  I knew I know, but when you first came around, I, you know, I said, cause we're doing what's  his name?  Tough crowd college.  Yeah.  So, and then I got to know him.  I know about you.  And, but a lot of these guys, they were saying to me, you don't know him.  You don't know him.  I'm saying Jesus.  Don't you like him?  I said, I never saw him work.  Cause I don't go nowhere. 
[03:01:30]  Right.  Right.  I don't go anywhere.  And I'm going to go, you know, but the new breed of comic is, is completely different  than what I do.  You were doing.  Sure.  You know, but, and they're wonderful.  But Jimmy Schubert, we, we love the guy and we really do, but we make fun of the fact  that he comes up with these, what do you call it?  These euphemisms or these great euphemisms.  You know, like, I get what he's saying.  I understand that.  Yeah.  But he has something like that.  Dom Herrera.  Dom does it.  Dom Herrera does about 15 minutes of these kinds of remarks.  You want to get him to do that.  It's hilarious.  Herrera is great. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've seen him do that.  But Schubert has a million of them and we make fun of the fact that he might do it a  little too much.  I can't remember some of them.  I just remember that instead of coming, he would go, then you got, you know, you got  to put your, put your meat stick in a meat pocket and then you got potato flakes.  Well, potato flakes.  What the?  I can't remember anything you would do.  But that's funny.  It's very funny.  That's funny.  Spew out your baby batter.  Let it dry on the back.  Wipe off the potato flakes.  What?  What the fuck?  Pat Tammy. 
[03:02:30]  Pasquinelli or Pasqu...  Yeah, she's wonderful.  Pascatelli.  Yeah, she's terrific.  Is that the one you're working with?  Tammy Pascatelli, Dom Herrera, and yours truly working at the theater in Schenectady.  That's a solid bill and it has that whole Italian theme going through the whole show.  No, it's going to be Japanese.  What the fuck is that?  She's very sexy, Tammy.  I know her from Last Comic Standing.  She was great at Last Comic Standing.  She's not only sexy, she's a nice lady.  In fact, her boyfriend called me about a year ago, said, Pat, would you be in my movie?  I said, I'd love to be.  Haven't heard of him since.  Oh, boy.  Not that I care.  That doesn't matter. 
[03:03:00]  But I'm looking forward to meeting her again.  She's very funny.  And I think this girl has a shot to make it big, but something seems to be missing.  I can't put my hand on it.  Maybe it's bad managers.  Who knows?  I don't know who our managers are, but maybe that's it.  Sometimes it's a bad manager.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Let Pat, I don't know, maybe rest his voice.  We'll all piss, hopefully.  Let's all piss.  Yeah, let's go piss.  We'll all piss together.  I don't pitch.  Don't start putting me into fucking athletics.  Leave me the fuck alone.  What time is it now?  It's 10.30. 
[03:03:30]  It's over.  You're going home?  Well, how long do you want?  I don't know what the fuck you want from me.  I don't know if you want.  What time do you get off this fucking show?  We don't even know.  Sometimes we don't even do the show.  I'm going to wind up on slides after this fucking show.  I want to color.  You know what's funny?  The listener's bitch, because sometimes we don't show up.  Other times we go a little late.  We can't help it.  We have no bosses around here.  We can't leave right now.  No one's going to tell us no.  That's a bad way to do your job.  I notice you do it twice.  You'll see how fast this fucking person be a cement block. 
[03:04:00]  Well, I guess you make a point there.  I think it would probably be nice to have bosses around to keep us in line.  I don't know.  Not that we're hoping for that.  Trust me, buddy.  Fuck them.  I had enough bosses in my life.  Yeah, exactly.  I like sitting around here with no boss.  It's nice.  You're right.  They're smart.  Well, you guys got a good rep.  You just signed another contract.  I still don't know what the fuck you do, but it's amazing.  Don't either.  Don't, don't.  See, this is what I'm looking at now.  I live in, I'm looking to stay here permanently in New York because I live in Vegas because  I'm looking to stay here.  Put your man on earth. 
[03:04:30]  I was going to say, what's your secret?  Stay here permanently.  I'd rather come back here because this is my hat.  He just gave me the look.  Pat just gave me a look.  It was a smile.  Funny, funny boy.  That was a nice try smile.  Cute, kid.  Cute.  Get the fuck out of here.  You live in Vegas too, Pat?  You live in Vegas there?  Yeah, I bought a little contract.  I got rid of all my property, my land and everything and my home.  You're going to fucking be around for another 20 years and you're giving everything away.  You're going to be a homeless. 
[03:05:00]  No, no, no.  I didn't give it.  I gave it to my grandchildren.  What the fuck am I going to do?  They're going to throw you out.  I bought, I bought, listen to this.  I bought four, eight acres on a street called Tamiasso.  I bought it off Wayne Newton's brother 20 years ago.  And I let it go.  I never didn't even think about it.  I fucking landed.  Now I get an offer about two years ago.  I'll come glomble.  Come glomble.  And they're going to buy it.  And I said, well, we start dickening back and forth, $3, $9, $8, $7.  And then we finally come to the thing.  Boom.  And I says, good. 
[03:05:30]  We signed the fucking paper.  Going to give me a half now.  Then I throw it down and down.  And about a month later, I get a call.  Mr. Cooper, it says, this is Charles Levine.  Yes, Charles.  We're finding water underneath your land.  I said, get a gondola.  What the fuck you want me to do?  He said, excuse me?  I says, get a.  What the fuck you want me to do?  We got a deal.  Can you take $150,000 off?  I said, listen to me.  This is a desert.  You found fucking water.  Exactly.  You found water. 
[03:06:00]  Are you out of your fucking mind?  True story.  Now he turns around and the corporation, the people, the people that are doing to leave the city.  He's got to get a pump to get the fucking water out.  Now, the pump, he can't put it on the street.  He's got to be careful because the street will fucking sink.  He puts the pump in.  The pump goes into the fucking dirt.  Now he's about eight feet in a puddle of fucking water with the pump.  And he calls me again.  I mean, literally crying.  Mr. Cooper, I don't know what I'm going to do.  He says, I got to know the conglomerate. 
[03:06:30]  They think I'm pulling some fucking shit.  I said, listen to me.  I'm not a genius, but I'm going to fucking bail you out.  I'm out to God.  What's next to you?  He says, the big park.  Put the fucking water in the pump.  He says, what?  There's a fucking, he says, they got these fucking sprinklers.  They're paying through the fucking, they're paying through their balls for the water.  Because water is expensive.  It's very expensive.  He says, what do you mean?  Get the fucking pump working and pump the fucking water in the park.  Call up the guy who owns the park or the fucking park corporation. 
[03:07:00]  Say, I got free fucking water.  What are they going to say?  No?  He says, geez, I never thought of it.  He says, you think I can charge it?  Now you're greedy.  Now you want to fucking charge it?  Get rid of the fucking water.  P.S.  They're still pumping fucking water.  Wow.  And the fucking, they can't put a house on it because the house will end up in a basement.  Wow.  All right.  Good for you.  That went down your favor.  You got the money, right?  No, I got, no, they had to give me the money.  Of course.  My lawyer's got one arm, but he's got a fucking brain.  I don't know who wrote this, but somebody wanted to ask. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, wait, it's up here.  Let them ask it themselves.  Brian in Kansas City.  We got Pat Cooper on the show.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Pat, I love your comedy, man.  You're great.  Thank you.  I want to know, how do you like Vegas now compared to what it was like back in the Sinatra era?  Very simple.  It's a metropolis today.  All they need now is Batman.  That's what it is.  Years ago, it was a gambling, gambling town. 
[03:08:00]  It was a different attitude.  I mean, you could not pay for food.  If you didn't eat in the lobby with all those fucking buffets, they were offended.  And if you're a $3,000 roller, you got the room for nothing.  They sent you back with a half a case of fucking booze when you went.  They paid for everything.  Now they don't pay to give you a cock.  Now you turn around.  It's points.  You get 35 points.  You win a sandwich.  Fuck your sandwich.  That's what it is.  Now, if you're a multimillionaire and you got it in the cage, what the fuck? 
[03:08:30]  You say, I'm pissed off.  I didn't get the hat.  What the fuck do you need the hat for?  You dumb cocksucker.  You're a millionaire.  You want a fucking sans hat?  You want a fucking hat?  You sick fuck.  He goes, yeah, but what should I do?  What the fuck is your problem?  You can open a fucking hat factory, you stupid fuck.  I don't know.  It just pisses me off.  That guy only went for $30,000 to get the fucking hat.  I'll give you a fucking box of hats, you sick fuck.  That's what's wrong. 
[03:09:00]  Years ago, you didn't have to.  They gave you.  The woman came.  They gave her fucking flowers.  They gave her a box.  They cost not hours in charge.  And the wise guys know gambling.  Don't let all these bullshit fucking corporations.  They're in gambling.  They're part of the fucking heart of gambling.  That's to the guys that know.  Now they got machines.  All fucking machines that you got to be careful.  You're going to cheat.  You didn't cheat with the wise guys.  You did not cheat.  They put you in the room and took your fucking finger off. 
[03:09:30]  And you never called the cops.  You never said nothing.  But today, with all the mechanism and everything, people are still fucking around.  It's bullshit.  It's a big metropolis.  Comics today, if they want to work there, unless they're a big giant, got to buy the room.  They said, Pat, you want to buy a room?  I don't want to be your partner.  They said, well, you take the door.  I said, I got eight doors in my fucking house.  I don't need another fucking door.  Why am I going to be your fucking partner?  I don't need it.  You want me?  You pay me.  You don't want me?  No hard feelings.  I'm fucking dead anyway. 
[03:10:00]  It's fucking over.  So you're not going to offend me.  Go, you're not going to work no more.  Who gives a fuck?  God bless you, man.  But I'm serious.  I'm not trying to be a wise ass.  I mean, at 80 fucking years old, if I could get one hump before I die, just one hump, then I say, it's good.  I made it.  It's over.  What the fuck is that?  Water.  Hey, where else can you get free water?  Vegas is out of control.  Yeah, from your yard.  From your old yard.  It's not the same.  Nothing's the same. 
[03:10:30]  It became, you become a mechanic when you walk in there.  You're like a fucking robot.  You got to be careful.  You can't.  Now, here's a funny thing.  You turn around and you lose, say, $30,000.  All right?  Now, they will not give you a fucking receipt that you lost the $30,000.  I said, wait a minute.  If I lost $30,000 and I won $15,000, I got to pay tax on the $15,000, but I lost $30,000.  So I'm out $15,000.  Give me a receipt.  You get cocked.  That's what you get.  Cocked.  In fucking old days, they didn't give you the whole $30,000. 
[03:11:00]  And I say, you have to pay.  Get the fuck out.  Here's your money.  Go.  You want to go home?  We'll get you an arm guard.  We'll take you to the plane.  Today, when you're things, you're making tons of money.  All of a sudden, your plane is not going to leave on time.  I've had friends of mine, you know, I had $200,000.  The guy said, well, it's going to be a four-hour wait.  He lost $10,000.  I've seen that more than once.  That's the game they play.  Our buddy here, he likes to gamble a little bit.  Look, I like to play the horses.  And gets the private to play every once in a while. 
[03:11:30]  He's up at that level.  He likes the blackjack.  All right.  Listen, from the beginning, the best thing to play is what do you call it?  Craps, they say.  No, no.  The other one.  They say craps is the best odds, though.  The card game.  What's the card game?  Blackjack.  No.  The other one.  Hold him.  Baccarat.  Oh, Baccarat.  That's the best odds for you.  Really?  Yeah.  Best odds.  They say it's Baccarat.  That's when you see these multi-millionaires.  Who the hell knows how to play that dumb game?  You got to make nine or anything closer to nine.  Then you'll become the dealer with the fucking shave. 
[03:12:00]  You got to go like, it's a fucking hook.  I don't know.  I like to play the horses.  It gets a little too confusing, man.  Blackjack, 21.  There you go.  Easy.  You can't fucking win.  At 21?  You can't win.  You can win that day.  Go home and never play again.  He's right.  That's the fucking story.  That's how it works.  I'm playing horses since when the old Jamaica track was here.  You can't fucking win.  Nicky Rooney said it cost me $9 million to get my $2 back.  That's his fucking thing.  That's your story.  All right? 
[03:12:30]  So what are you trying to say?  They're telling you you can't win.  They put signs there.  Asshole, you can't win.  Give me another $3,000.  Give me another $6,000.  What else is new?  Wow.  Brilliant.  All right, so you don't like Vegas.  I love Vegas.  So you want to come back to the East Coast?  I want it because, listen to me, I'm a New Yorker.  This is where the action is.  You're a New Yorker.  Well, there's no action here for me in the sense that you say.  There's action in Vegas.  You want action.  It's all, you know, I love New York.  I get a buzz here.  I get on a bus to come here this morning. 
[03:13:00]  I get on a subway.  I go downtown.  I go shopping or whatever I fucking do.  I'm home.  I'm fucking home.  I miss my grandkids.  But when I'm home, they're either doing homework.  They're in a picnic.  They work there.  So then I go in the garage, and my daughter goes, the grandkids are coming over.  I press the button.  The garage door goes up.  They pass.  Hiya, Grandpa.  And then they leave.  I put the garage door down, and I go to fucking bed.  They're 12 and 13.  They're becoming teenagers.  They're starting to get a, you know, they want to know why something is ringing in their body.  So, you know, I tell my daughter, watch them, you know, and tell them the truth, whatever it's all about. 
[03:13:30]  But they're good kids, but I'm not a guy that's going to sit there and be with them five, six days a week.  You don't like kids?  I can't.  I love them, but I don't see them.  If I'm there seven fucking days, I'm going to see one.  But you can't relate to them?  Is that what you're getting at?  You can't relate to them?  I can relate to them.  I tell them, shut up.  I'm your grandfather.  That's it.  They call me Papa.  I say, yes, I'm your Papa.  So I bust my fuzz rules.  What's a fuzz rule?  I said, I forget about it.  They don't know.  They're retired.  They don't have a fucking clue. 
[03:14:00]  You know, but they're different kids.  They have different computers.  They're geniuses on a computer.  Pat, that's your TV show right there.  You as a grandfather, like, trying to relate to your grandkids that are into the internet  and all the crazy things.  That's funny.  That would be the show right there.  Right, Jimmy?  That would be funny.  Wait a minute.  Here's what I'll make him play me because I'm too fucking old.  Oh, stop.  Are you fucking crazy?  I can't remember sometimes my own fucking name.  You want me to go there?  I made two movies with De Niro, right?  I made about nine movies in my career.  Nobody's called me since. 
[03:14:30]  Nobody.  You're good in the movies.  But don't matter.  Nobody's called me since.  So what does that mean?  I don't get a friend.  It's okay.  Who the fuck figures we do the two movies with this guy?  And he's a wonderful man.  I said, that's when you accept that.  Can't go, Marriott, Captain, they're not calling me.  Who gives a fuck?  Who gives a fuck they not call me?  People say, don't Robin like you?  I'm not in his life.  We did the movie.  Goodbye, Robin.  It's a fucking pleasure.  Then on the roast, I don't know if you went to Jerry Lewis roast.  When I said, Robert, he was behind me.  I said, let me tell you about Robert De Niro. 
[03:15:00]  He talks with a fucking lisp.  He spit all over me for 20 fucking minutes.  I said, I said, fucker Martin Scorsese.  He says, you're fucking crazy.  See, and I turned down Martin Scorsese for Casino.  This was my scene.  Uh, hiya, Ma.  Cut!  I said, that's my scene, Martin?  Goodbye.  And I didn't do it.  So my wife says, you're not going to be called no more.  You turned down Martin.  I didn't turn him down.  I turned the fucking scene down.  Sure.  She says, you're never going to make another movie.  Who gives a shit? 
[03:15:30]  Wind up is I made two movies with De Niro.  So you can't listen to what people say.  They don't do this.  Oh, fuck you.  I am an individual.  I am me.  I can't be him.  I can't be you.  I'm me.  I don't steal material.  I don't want to be nobody else.  You like me, you like me.  I don't like me.  What the fuck can I tell you?  My family didn't like me.  What the fuck is that saying?  My mother was on the Stein Show.  She said to me, you owe me back rent.  Why the fuck are you going to call me home?  You got to call me the fucking Stein Show.  Yeah, you have to do this on the show?  Oh, God.  Yeah, right.  I remember that years ago.  All right, we're going to take a break. 
[03:16:00]  We got Pat Cooper.  Pat, if you want to stay, we'd love to have you.  You're your own man.  I got to get out of here by 11 because I got a radio show at 1230.  Well, whose show?  None of your fucking business.  Well, maybe we can promote it for you.  We don't need ratings over here.  I'm doing a radio show from Schenectady.  Oh, on the phone?  No, no.  I'm on my crotch.  How the fuck do you think I'm going to go?  What the fuck do you think I'm going to go to Schenectady?  How did you get the show?  How did you get the show?  What a swan is.  I don't even know.  I'm looking for a steady fucking show. 
[03:16:30]  It's going to be called Aggravation.  I'd love to do a show in the morning, say 6 to 9, and aggravate the fucking world.  Hey, hey, that's our bit.  But I got news here.  That's a bit optimistic, don't you think?  After June 7, I don't have a date until October.  So I got a girl who wants me to go to Vermont with her.  She has a place in Vermont.  She said, Pat, I've always been turned on to you.  And I said, well, you know, that's nice.  She says, I have a place in Vermont. 
[03:17:00]  She says, are you afraid of animals?  I said, we don't like dogs.  She said, bears?  Bears?  But bears.  She said, well, we have bears that they suck on the sap from the fucking trees.  We're going to Vermont.  I said, you want me to go?  She said, well, you know, I have a rifle.  I said, fuck you.  I ain't going to no fucking Vermont to watch a fucking bear suck on some sap.  I'll be a sap if I go to fucking Vermont.  That's the office I get.  She's 65.  She says, you know, I get horny once in a while.  I says, well, ring a fucking bell.  What do you want me to do? 
[03:17:30]  Pat Cooper.  And Pat Cooper's doing his Pal Talk show.  I believe we're doing the show with you.  No, you've got to believe you.  I better fucking be there.  Well, where the fuck do we have to?  I don't even know.  I would like you to come, too, because, you know, I love you.  Where are we going with this?  Where's this going to be?  Oh, at the Friars Club?  And if you play your cunts right, I'll pick you to a great restaurant.  You'll be my guest.  Oh, what is it, Dan?  Rio's?  Listen to me.  Anybody can go to fucking Rio's.  Rio's is a tough one.  Have you ever been to Rio's?  Rio's, actually.  No.  All right.  What do you think is special about Rio's?  Just because it's like a mob joint. 
[03:18:00]  No, it's not.  No.  I'm obsessed with mob stuff.  Used to be.  No more.  I will tell you, years ago, I went there when nobody got there, when the husband and wife,  wonderful people, I mean, cooked family, family.  I mean, and a lot of the wise guys would sit there and have their sandwich and money.  But all of a sudden, this thing started to, because what's the name from the Times?  Went in day one day.  And the woman says, what do you want?  Because she was very well dressed from the Times.  She goes, well, I heard about you have nicer.  What do you want to eat?  So she's looking at these wise guys. 
[03:18:30]  She says, I'll take the same there.  And I think it was veal, cutlet, parmigiano.  Yes.  So she ate it the next day, which was, no, the two days later, which was Sunday, on the  fucking food front page, gave them three stars.  Now, they were taking numbers over the fucking phone.  Now, who calls up?  Mario Cuomo wants to come down.  Now, the vice president wants to come down.  Now, they had to give up the fucking phone.  They were making $3,000 a week on the phone.  Now, they're down to $300 a week selling the fucking food.  So this is a fucking movie.  But can I tell you something? 
[03:19:00]  Frank Pellegrino, God bless him, and the lawyer, I think of his name, and I'm a stretch.  Wonderful guy.  Turns around, and they built a monster.  They got one in Vegas now.  Wow.  But the difference between Vegas and New York, the people that go to Rays in Vegas don't  know New York's Rays.  There's a difference, because you can't get the kind of food that you get in New York.  And they built a monster there.  Now, it becomes a, you know, you want a table, you got to know the Pope.  You got to know the Pope.  I've been there maybe eight, nine times.  I don't wait on a line for nobody.  I don't wait on a line for nobody.  You want to give me the table, I take the table, I invite four or five people. 
[03:19:30]  You sit down and I eat.  The only way I can get a table, my friends got the table, I take my table and bring whoever  you want.  But it becomes crazy.  There are 90 restaurants in this town just as good.  That's not better, right?  But they have charisma.  It's like a little candy store.  And it's just, I mean, some of the biggest stars have gone down there and been refused.  That's why people like that place, because that guy says, you don't have a reservation  here, you don't get in.  So they should make a movie about this fucking place. 
[03:20:00]  There you go.  Yeah, Friars Club.  You know, we've been, I want to check out that joint.  Who was, Jeffrey Ross was supposed to take us for lunch, and that never happened.  And do we have to wear a dumb sports jacket?  I don't want to wear the sports jacket.  You see the way you dress, you're overdressed.  Really?  What, to go to Rayo's?  No, Friars Club.  Get with your baby suit.  Stop busting my balls.  What the fuck are you kidding me?  It's only a fucking hour once in a while.  I don't even know if anybody's listening.  No, I'm going.  I just don't want the sports coat.  You don't have no coat, Jeff.  Come to where you are.  It's one of those places, all of a sudden, they give you like a sports coat that hasn't 
[03:20:30]  been dry cleaned in years.  Smells like mothballs.  Do you hear what I said?  Come to where you are.  Peculiar.  How about a steam?  Can we steam together?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  How the fuck did you get this show?  How the fuck did you get this show?  I asked that question myself.  You're going to come down and make sure you bring him to me.  Well, me and Jimmy and Ant, we want to just have like a steam.  Because we hear all the guys, they do a little steam together.  Oh, no, no.  We want to have a steam together?  What's wrong with you?  Yeah.  Jimmy, would you do a little steam with Pat Cooper? 
[03:21:00]  That's what I'd love to do.  How many times I have a steam, I bring about two dozen clams in the fucking mansion.  I never use their facilities.  I'm going to steam with you guys?  Why?  Because I don't want to steam.  I don't want nothing.  I don't want to steam.  See, Anthony's embarrassed by what he's sporting.  He knows that the towel's not going to be able to cover up his...  It has nothing to do with that.  I don't want to steam with you guys.  What are we going to do?  Sit around half naked and talk?  We talk all fucking day here.  Pat.  What are we going to say?  Ant has a big hog.  What do I got to say to you? 
[03:21:30]  He's got a...  Because I'm Italian.  He's got a big one.  It's like a dinty more beef stew can.  He's got a big one.  I would never steam.  Not in size, but in texture.  I had a piss, man.  I'm going to do this.  Pat might be here.  I mean, he's his own person.  He might be here when we get back.  If not, it was great, Pat.  God bless you.  Pat Cooper.  The great Pat Cooper.  We'll do line of the day next.  Turn off for this shit.  Hi, this is Pat Cooper.  You're listening to the worst crap I've ever heard of Opie and Antony.  Opie and Antony. 
[03:22:00]  Now presenting comedian Doug Stanhope.  How many dwarfs can you fight off before you get tired?  That is the question we asked today.  Yeah.  And you know, someone that might have an answer is Doug Stanhope.  Because he likes the drugs.  Doug.  Doug would start smoking.  Good morning.  Hey, Doug.  Here's the deal.  Hey, Doug.  We're going to start with this.  We just found out that Tyra Banks did her show on Primordial Dwarfs.  You ever see these things?  That colored girl, right?  Yeah.  You ever see these things? 
[03:22:30]  Primordial Dwarfs?  No.  No.  They look like progeria kids.  You ever see a progeria kid?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That aging disease?  Yeah.  They look like them, only they're about two feet tall.  They are freakish alien looking things.  Yeah, they're very, like, they're squishy.  Like, they look like their parts are squished in a little bit.  Like those twisty cats?  What's a twisty cat? 
[03:23:00]  Twisty cat was, like, a big news story several years ago where this woman was breeding these cats that didn't have front paws.  Their bones were missing from the front paws.  They were genetic defects that she was purposely breeding.  And they hopped like kangaroos on their back feet, missing bones.  Oh, how great is that?  How cute.  And why was she doing this?  She thought they were adorable.  I'm looking at twisty cats.  Quick Google, and there you go.  You can look at twisty cats thanks to Doug Stano. 
[03:23:30]  See?  And what?  They hopped.  Primordial Dwarf.  Oh, go to Primordial Dwarf in your Google search.  Yeah, yeah.  Take a look at one of these.  You've never seen anything more rapable than a Primordial Dwarf.  I'm obsessed with the fucking one.  You're not the only people with Google in this town.  Please hold.  Please hold.  Doug's thrown in Primordial Dwarf in your Google search.  Yeah, we're not getting good pictures of them, though. 
[03:24:00]  Nah, we've got to get the ones that Maury Povich gets.  See, Tyra's Primordial Dwarf special.  Go to that one.  Oh, yeah.  Primordial.  I must have misspelled.  I got Dave Mordal.  That's different.  All right, image.  All right.  There you go.  The first one.  E-Rock, up there.  I think you found one.  You found it?  Yeah, I found him.  All right, listen, Doug, we do this thing on Monday.  It's called Pod Talk Monday.  So today, here's the thought. 
[03:24:30]  Primordial Dwarfs, they're coming at you.  How many can you fight off before you get too tired and you lose the battle?  And here's the deal.  Do I have a pool cue?  Huh?  Do I have a pool cue?  Pool cue?  You can use whatever the fuck you want, but they keep on coming.  There's not like a certain amount.  It's not like you against 10,000.  They just keep coming.  When do you finally lose the battle with the Primordial Dwarfs?  You know what?  I can't imagine them actually, like, once they gut to you, like, how would they?  I can only imagine them, like, giving you, like, slobbery hickeys or something. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah, but just basically imagine biting and punching and kicking you.  Now, they'd be easy to kick away, I think.  But if they're all coming at you from all angles, you'd have to start helicoptering a few around, I think.  One of us.  One of us.  Great.  Yeah.  So we're talking about Primordial Dwarfs and Twisty Cats today with Doug Stanhope. 
[03:25:30]  What's up, Doug?  Hey, good morning.  Yeah.  I've got my fake I'm awake voice on.  Yeah.  So do we.  Are you in New Mexico?  Yeah, Arizona.  I'm at home.  Okay.  Also, it's pretty early.  Yeah, yeah.  So we're on Dirty Talk O&A?  Yeah, this is filthy language radio.  It's good old filthy talk.  Fantastic.  Yeah.  Hey, we had Chris Hansen on. 
[03:26:00]  We were trying to get a hold of you, but it didn't work out, unfortunately.  Yeah, that was a Wednesday.  I have these Wednesday drunk dial nights now because I got Last Comic Standing followed  by Chris Hansen.  So it's like this double whammy of hate.  I drink through it and then I just, I try to vlog, but I can't spell.  So I just call people and go, you might have to believe this shit.  God damn it.  Yeah.  You don't like Chris Hansen?  Oh, no.  That guy's just self-important fucking douche hole. 
[03:26:30]  Self-important douche.  Oh, yeah.  He's awful.  That show just fucking kills me.  It's worse fear-mongering than even terrorism because parents get so into that.  Oh, well, if you watch that show, you'll see that these pedophiles are more of a problem.  Yeah, if your kid's sitting online going, hi, yeah, hi, random 55-year-old dude I've never  met.  My name's Brittany.  I'm rubbing baby oil on myself by the pool. 
[03:27:00]  God, I wish I had a wine cooler.  I live at 125 Washington Avenue.  Christ, I wish you'd just stop by.  Yeah, if you make yourself a pedophile's wet dream.  Yeah, it's such fucking horrible entrapment.  I don't think, Doug, Doug, entrapment, though, is like, come on, if you're getting somebody  to, like, approach you as a pedophile, it's almost like you can't trick a non-pedophile  into trying to fuck a 13-year-old.  Maybe you can. 
[03:27:30]  First of all, pedophile means someone who wants to fuck prepubescent kids.  When you get a fucking hot chick like they have on there, and they, you know...  Well, you know what?  Can I jump in?  Uh, Patrice O'Neal was in, and, uh, he kind of made the point that they're making these,  uh, these girls, these decoys, just short of fuckable, and Patrice is like, if you really  want to do this, why don't you do it with 10 and 9-year-olds?  But they're trying to kind of, they're kind of like tapping into the, the, I hate to say 
[03:28:00]  it, sort of the hotness of the whole thing, that it's a, it's a 13, it's a 14, it's in  that weird age.  Don't apologize for it.  Don't apologize for it.  Were you 14 once?  Did you want to fuck?  Okay, then.  Right.  Did you know what you were doing?  Yes, you did.  Basically what Patrice was saying, you know, they know exactly what they're doing by using  that, that weird age there, you know?  I mean, if they really did it with, like, uh, 8 and 9-year-olds, it would be so creepy.  No one would walk in that fucking way.  Yeah, then you would just want to, like, shoot the guy when he walks in the door. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah.  Then you'd have a serious problem.  Still wrong, obviously.  I don't want to be jumping on the radio saying that, you know, I'm condoning this, but I  mean, I think Patrice made a pretty interesting point, you know, because if you really want  to take care of this problem, you know, set it up with 8 or 9-year-olds.  But do they, do predators really catch 8 or 9-year-olds?  I think most pedophiles or whatever probably don't go after 8 or 9-year-olds online because the  communication skills aren't there.  Like, a 12 or 13-year-old can sneak out, meet you somewhere, have a relationship online. 
[03:29:00]  I don't think an 8 or a 9-year-old can.  I mean, it's...  They've got to be taken from the house.  Yeah, I think most times you've got to meet them.  And most pedophiles or most victims of pedophilia, they know they're an attacker.  It's a family member.  It's not someone they met online.  Because, again, you don't, if you teach your kids even the most basic skills.  We grew up without the internet, and there were just as many pedophiles.  We just didn't have the internet.  And your parents dealt with it by talking to you. 
[03:29:30]  They'd go, hey, don't talk to strangers.  Some of them might want to fuck you.  And you go, thanks, Dad.  I'm going to log that information in my brain.  And that's why you didn't, you know, get fucked by a stranger.  That's why you got fucked by your uncle.  They never said don't talk to your uncle.  But if you have just the most minimal parenting, you're not going to do that online.  But it's also hard.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  I say it's also hard because it's like online you really think you're talking to a 13-year-old.  In person, you know you're talking to a strange adult. 
[03:30:00]  Like they'll say don't go up to strangers.  But you kind of know.  Your parents never say to you when you're a kid, never talk to somebody else your age who's a stranger.  They encourage you to make friends.  So it's like online it's a little bit different because you a lot of times think you're talking to somebody who's 12 or 13.  But you're really talking to a guy who's 50.  That's the difference is the anonymity typically you don't have in person that you have online.  I would love to do a reverse thing with like a 35-year-old woman saying,  God, I really want to get laid by a 14-year-old boy and just bust all the sea of 14-year-old boys who show up. 
[03:30:30]  Show up their dicks out.  You just touch their penises with lit match heads and say, dirty boy!  And then watch what happens to them in 20 years.  You wear condoms?  What were you planning on doing this?  A wonder of three.  It's such a double standard, though, man.  I mean, you know, women sleeping with boys of 14 or 15.  We barely blink when those stories hit the paper. 
[03:31:00]  Hey, by the way, Squeaky Wheel writes, Hanson explained that it's not entrapment because they do not approach the pedos.  The pedos reach out to the plants unprovoked.  He did make that point on our show.  But even if they didn't, you couldn't entrap me into having sex with a 10- or 11-year-old.  You just couldn't do it because it's not what I want to do.  I always kind of believe in entrapment, but in a way, I don't.  Like, eh, if you're going to do it, man, you're going to do it.  Yeah.  It's like if they put dope on the table.  As a weak analogy, but if they put a $100 bill on a bus bench and if they've vilified C's as much as they do pedophiles, they go, oh, this person, they pocketed the $100 bill. 
[03:31:30]  Well, all right, if you're going to wave it around like that, you're going to get takers.  But don't act like it's this epidemic that it's not.  Well, I'll tell you, the thing is, though, like, with $100, I mean, I know you acknowledge a $100 bill is kind of an odd thing, but it's like, you know, $100 is something anybody can use. 
[03:32:00]  Fucking a child is something only a small percentage of the population comprehends.  Most of us don't, like, work 40 hours a week to fuck a child.  I said most of us.  You know, occasionally it's a fun thing and a stress relief.  Who am I to judge?  Asterisk.  And I know this quarter's on a Nambla argument, but at what point are you an adult?  Well, nature gives you the ability to bear children, to be a parent at roughly 13 years old.  At what point, like, and the government says you're not even ready to drink a beer until you're 21. 
[03:32:30]  Like, at what point is it bullshit?  Like, naturally, you don't want to fuck someone way out of your age range.  That's natural.  I don't want to fuck a 15-year-old for the same reason I don't want to fuck a 70-year-old.  I have nothing to say to them, you know?  I'll take the 15-year-old over the 70-year-old.  Yeah, exactly.  Hey, Rick.  Hey, Reverend writes from North Carolina, just tell Doug to shut up and view it as entertainment.  I think even NBC would admit that it's gotten past the awareness stage of this show. 
[03:33:00]  But it does probably scare pedophiles, though.  I guarantee you that that has changed the way they do things.  Yeah.  I mean, I guarantee you there's less guys doing it because they're like, fuck that, man.  You can talk, but you can't go over.  At least less guys doing it that way.  Yeah.  Hey, Doug.  Yeah, I'll find a nice new way.  Doug, you got that computer.  Go to break.com and type in to catch a Chris Hansen.  He came in and Anthony did Chris Hansen to Chris Hansen.  It was really, really funny.  Really good.  You're going to want to check that out.  Oh, by the way, I just got to acknowledge something. 
[03:33:30]  I didn't intentionally try to steal a Ron Bennington bit, so relax.  About what?  Fighting things.  People are just getting, oh, relax.  I wouldn't try to just casually steal a Ron bit.  We traded that bit for Big A and Stalker Patty.  There you go.  I'm the one that mentioned that, not Ope, and I've never heard Ron Bennington do that bit.  I mentioned I could beat up 10,000 of them. 
[03:34:00]  Ron talks about beating up kids.  Oh, really?  Having kids.  Or animals.  I love Ron.  It's like, how would you fight a giraffe?  You got to choke him.  Big neck.  You can't punch him in the face.  It's too high.  So Ron's got his logic on how to beat things up.  But we're talking about primordial dwarves.  And they just keep coming like the Matrix.  Matrix, too.  So whatever, dude.  I didn't try to steal a Ron bit, so let's talk about it.  You'll hear about this all in my gym-itorial.  Yes. 
[03:34:30]  Give the gym-itorial.  What, Doug?  I'm sorry, man.  I had to free up the instant feedback there, Doug, because they're writing in like crazy.  And I want to get some Doug Stanhope instant feedback going here.  That's all right.  I just didn't know if that was one of the characteristics of these primordial dwarves,  was they attack in droves.  No, I think there's only, someone is reminding us there's only 80 in the world.  80 in the world.  So I guess, unfortunately, it would be a very, very short battle.  An extremely short battle.  That sucks to be them. 
[03:35:00]  They must be worth money.  Yeah, that's a collectives item.  Only 80.  If you could make them, like, what was that book where they created freaks?  Come on, it's a famous book.  I shouldn't try to think at this hour.  Gulliver's Travels?  Oh, no.  Never mind.  Harry Potter?  Creating freaks?  Frankenstein?  Don't make fun of, excuse me.  Don't make fun of Harry Potter.  Oh, I'm sorry, Jim. 
[03:35:30]  Don't make fun of Harry Potter.  The message board people don't like when you make fun of Harry Potter.  No.  Bunch of fruits.  No, no, no, no, no.  So that's good reading, and if you make fun of him, you're jealous.  Hey, Jason from Rye.  Shut the book up there, ass.  Well, no, hold on.  Before we get into butters, but this is why I wanted to free up the instant feedback,  because I know people keep close tabs on you, Doug.  Jason from Rye, he writes, here you go.  Just ask Doug about his discovery of male urethra fingering. 
[03:36:00]  Oh, cock fingering.  All right.  Okay, don't even.  Come on, let's go.  What do you got?  No fucking way.  What do you got, dude?  Ow.  Doug, what?  You've never seen cock fingering?  No.  No.  All right, I've got to grab my cock now and squeeze it.  Explain cock fingering.  Oh, it's just a random porn I've come across.  It's digits in the male urethra, and options.  Come on, you've seen this stuff.  Wait, wait, wait.  It's like little wrenches in his urethra. 
[03:36:30]  I can understand maybe like a pencil tip or something, but you're talking fingers in there?  Oh, nothing.  You've never, come on.  It hurts getting a little shampoo in there if you're jacking off with it.  Dude, a little soap.  I'm just saying this.  You have to take a leak and it's like, ah, what happened?  Wait, explain, Doug.  Come on.  I swear I haven't seen this stuff.  The guy's referring to a bit that's like a seven-minute chunk of material that I'm not  going to just bust into.  No, we don't need your bid. 
[03:37:00]  We just like talking to you.  I've used it as an example of like weird porn.  Again, it's in the whole child pornography vein where they go, child pornography is rampant  on the internet and like, why don't I ever see it?  But I've seen cockfingering.  Like I have a, if you go to my message board, there's a thread called the Tsunami of Poon  where people just post like the most horrible pornography they can find.  And I've, yeah, there's just stuff shoved down the cockhole. 
[03:37:30]  I've seen several of that.  I've seen it just wandering the internet, just clicking on like.  I used to see a dominatrix and she would, you know, whatever, old toilet games.  But she was talking about a doctor she used to see and what he liked her to do was take  a scalpel and put the scalpel in the tip of his cock and just hold it there and then  yank it out.  Like not dig deep with it, but just put the blade in and go and yank the scalpel up. 
[03:38:00]  And she said the thrill for this doctor, because he knew it wouldn't permanently damage him,  was that when he'd pee like for the next couple of days, he would feel it and remember that  domination.  Feel it.  And was talking about it.  Like we've all like masturbated with shampoo and shit and something happens where like  a little gets in your pee hole.  And then all of a sudden you have to take a leak like an hour or two later and it burns,  it burns, man.  Stings.  What is that about, by the way?  I don't know.  The inside of your fucking dick hole ain't meant for any fucking nothing. 
[03:38:30]  I don't know.  Let's go to Dr. Sanjay Gupta on line six.  Sanjay Gupta.  My friend Zool, he was this biker comic, Doug.  He was really funny.  He was just a fucking animal, but he was so dirty and he had this one joke, don't you  hate when you're taking a bath and you get a little soap in your pee hole and then mommy  has to come and suck it out?  He was such a fucking savage on stage.  By the way, Jason from Rye is apologizing to you, Doug. 
[03:39:00]  He didn't want you to launch into the bed.  He's a big fan, but he just figured it was worth discussing.  So what stuff have you seen this guy shoving his pee hole?  It's not this guy.  This is like a whole theme of porn.  It's just a thing.  You've heard of docking, right?  I mean, you've seen the guys with like the split cocks.  They've like pierced them so many times.  They've come in poo.  I've seen the split cock.  I don't understand what's going on in your brain to do that. 
[03:39:30]  You slice it right down the middle.  Show the split cock.  What the hell is this?  I'm sure everything is just a slippery path, you know?  Hey, why don't you tickle my asshole a little?  And the next thing you know, you're the goatsy guy.  All right, look.  We're looking at the mistress use their, the mistresses use their restrained slave  and forcibly insert things into his urethra.  Oh, these mistresses are cruel bitches for sure. 
[03:40:00]  And what is she shoving in there?  I don't know.  Like a nail or something?  It's a long metal thing.  It's a thing.  I'm getting woozy thinking about it.  Dude, I don't, I don't understand.  They do CBT cock and ball torture.  I don't get it.  Like there's guys that want to be tortured.  There are guys that lay down, yeah, and girls with high heels.  Yeah, high heels on the testicle.  Just heal the shit right on the testicle, right on the nut.  Not just the bag, right on the testicle?  Oh, my God.  And the dick and everything and just stomp it. 
[03:40:30]  Sometimes if my dick is struggling, my girlfriend will slap the back of it a little bit like this,  like not really hard, but it just kind of jump starts.  Like my dick's like, oh, all right.  Yeah, all right.  It's time to go here.  When you're coked up.  When you're coked up, that helps quite a bit, yeah.  Yeah, a little rough necking.  Come on.  And you've heard of the docking, right?  I read it in a fetish book back in the day.  Back in the day where you had to read to get pornography?  No, there was like a, remember that book? 
[03:41:00]  We used to read out of that back at AF back in the day.  They had talked about all these weird fetishes like axilism, which is.  Was that the armpit?  Yeah, having sex with an armpit.  I still remember some of these.  And the one was docking where you touch helmets, and the other guy is uncircumcised,  and he takes his skin and.  Rolls it over.  Rolls it over yours, and then you.  You're docked.  You're docked.  We have space dock.  You masturbate that way.  I got a nice bit out of that.  It'll keep you warm. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah.  I guess you just crank it from where they're, like, joined, and hold it together, and jack  it that way, and what, shoot into?  I, I, I, I.  Whatever.  I don't know.  Hey, let's go to Jason in Minnesota.  Jason, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I used to be into that thing where I could stick things into my pee hole and masturbate with.  It felt good.  I had, like, a metal kind of rod I would do it with. 
[03:42:00]  Um, and this was, you know, a couple years ago.  Um, and one day, I couldn't find it, and I was looking around my bedroom for things  that, you know, of the same size and orientation I could use, and I, I stumbled upon, you know,  like, when you're, you know, when you're horny, you're just looking for anything, you know.  Um.  No, I don't know.  Yeah, yeah.  I found the dripping, um, of wax on the side of a candle.  Like, I had lit a candle, and, you know, wax had dripped down the side, and I broke it  off, and I thought, wow, this is exactly what I need. 
[03:42:30]  So, I was using that to, uh, to jack off with it.  He actually said it, too.  He goes, wow, this is exactly what I need.  Why am I speaking out loud?  Go ahead.  Dude, you know, when you're younger and getting boners all the time, and you just need to,  you know, get rid of the poison, he'll do just about anything.  But I, I, I, I left my pee hole alone.  All left to the outside.  Right.  Dude, if you said, that's exactly what I need, you should have been looking at a psychotherapist.  My, my brother kind of showed me how, when we were little, he kind of turned me on to 
[03:43:00]  it.  Um.  But anyway, a piece of that candlelight broke off inside, and I couldn't get it out.  And I guess it kind of warmed up inside my body, and it kind of melted.  I had to, I just freaked out, and I had to go to the hospital and get it removed.  Oh.  How'd they remove you?  Did they use like a rolling pin?  Ha ha ha.  No, it was a, it was an inpatient procedure.  I was, I was there for two days while it healed, and, and, and.  Two days?  Did they cut it open? 
[03:43:30]  Yeah, they had to cut it open, and then scrape all the wax out, and now I got this neat little  scar.  What's the matter with you?  That's, that's, I don't get the pee hole thing.  Why don't you cut the malarkey already?  Just fucking hollow out something and fuck it like the rest of us do.  Yeah.  Okay.  Thanks, Jason.  Hey, uh, Travis from Kansas.  I've seen a video of a dildo in the pee hole.  It's life changing.  A dildo?  All right, now, see, Doug, now we're on to something here.  Now you've got some cock fingering to cock fucking, and that's something I haven't even  seen.  Well, let's.  Oh, man, that would be something.  Two guys, one is fucking the other guy's pee hole. 
[03:44:00]  How does it feel good?  What's the biggest thing you could take in your pee hole before you say, hey, hey, I'm  tapping out?  A whisker.  Me, personally?  What's my record?  I'm the old setup man.  I set up the pins.  It's called the amazing, the most disturbing, uh, porno I've ever watched, uh, video, was,  uh, the amazing Thai pee hole gangbang, uh, where she actually has a speculum in her 
[03:44:30]  urethra, where guys, guys bang her, and they get close-ups, you see the difference.  Get the fuck out of here.  They're banging her piss hole.  And then she blows cum bubbles, and it's actually, that's what, what, what I remember  from the back of the box was the description of, like, how she blows cum bubbles from her,  her bladder, and, as though, and it was written in a way that's supposed to be a turn-on,  and it was supposed to be a turn-on.  Oh, my God. 
[03:45:00]  The amazing Thai.  Hey, uh, yeah, sorry, go ahead, Doug, I interrupted.  Oh, no, I was just going to tout her performance, and she's got bowling pins in her and shit.  I'm a little distracted, because we got fucked.  That guy with the candle wax story, that's in a, that's in a book.  Brian in Atlanta, what's up?  Yeah, man, that's a Chuck Palahniuk story.  It's, uh, it's in this book called Haunted by Chuck Palahniuk.  It's, like, completely made up.  That motherfucker got us.  Hey, uh, you know what, I, uh, that was the first Chuck Palahniuk book I threw away, by 
[03:45:30]  the way.  Yeah, yeah, I hadn't made it all the way through, uh, but, uh, no, I mean, it's...  You know what, do your favor, do yourself a favor, man, if you're, if you got Haunted  and you're struggling through it, just, just throw it away, and find another book to read.  And I love Chuck Palahniuk, I couldn't get through that one.  I don't know who he is.  Fight Club.  Fight Club.  Ah.  Yeah.  All his books are really interesting.  Oh, I don't go for that type.  But Haunted was the first one, I just couldn't, it was, ugh, I hated it.  Dave in New York, what's up?  Hey, what's going on? 
[03:46:00]  You guys missed the sickest fucking thing there is.  Oh, sorry.  Um.  Sorry.  Ball enlargement, where those guys inject, like, a needle into their balls, and they just  pump them up with, like, uh, silicone or, uh, like, saline solution.  Their sac ends up getting to be as big as a freaking grapefruit.  It's called Body Modification.  It's, uh, they fill, yeah, really bizarre stuff.  They fill their cocks.  And I saw a documentary of these guys, and the one guy was just talking, and he said that  he had a tattoo.  He had, like, uh, he did something with his dick, so now he has to piss through a hole. 
[03:46:30]  Like, he doesn't piss through his dick.  The piss doesn't make it to the head of his dick.  He pisses, like, right above his balls.  And he had flames put around it, and he goes, I have to pith to put the fire out.  I have to pith to put the fire out.  This guy should just be shot.  Ew.  Why are you alive, sir?  Where did you find this documentary?  My friend John Mazerec had it.  He was a guy who worked in Port Newark.  Look at that.  Go to bmezine.com.  Body Modification e-zine.  They have everything you could possibly want to see on there. 
[03:47:00]  It's a free site.  A bm-e-zine.  Zine.com?  Yep.  Yeah.  All right, thank you, sir.  Dave in New York.  Dave in New York, thanks.  All right.  And does your ball stay that big?  Yes.  Or does the liquid get kind of just soaked into your body and go away?  No, no, I think they do stay big.  Apparently, I've heard the trannies in Brazil use it, too, to make their dicks bigger.  I've heard, like, people use it, like, on their bodies for all kinds of weird reasons  to make their balls.  Your dick and balls or just balls?  I guess it depends on what you want to do with it.  I've seen the documentary.  He had this documentary because somebody at Port Newark that he knew did body modification. 
[03:47:30]  And what the guys will do, and Stanhope has probably seen,  this is guys will, like, they slice the back of their cock open with a razor like a banana,  and they open it up, and it heals, and they put studs on the inside, and they tattoo the  inside.  It's really fucking...  This is...  I can't even...  Go to the world...  I can't even...  Hold on.  E-Rock, November 10, 2006.  World record attempts.  What are we looking at here?  What is this?  What is the world record attempts from this BMEZINE.com? 
[03:48:00]  What is this?  Suspension.  From his back?  Yeah.  This guy breaks record for most hooks in his back.  I've seen that.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Old hat.  So, new record from Russia.  What world record did Russia set?  Hundred...  Fifteen hundred needles for one hour?  What's that?  Most disconnected stripper.  Fifteen hundred needles in his...  What is that?  In his arm.  Oh, that's in his arm.  Oh.  Holy shit. 
[03:48:30]  Fifteen hundred needles in one arm.  What happened?  Did somebody get to 1498 and just bail out?  I'm going to 15.  That probably hurts.  All right.  See, Doug, look, you never disappoint.  The phones are lit now.  Let's go to Steve in Redback.  Steve, what's up?  Um, just want to let you guys know there's this fantastic little video I saw of this guy  inserting a AA battery into his cock hole and then firing it out like a little missile.  Oh.  If you could fire it out, well, then you'd have some incentive to do that. 
[03:49:00]  What the fuck?  Like a weapon.  We're just getting bored sexually, man.  I think we've done everything we possibly can.  What the fuck?  So now we're just, like, making up shit.  Your piss hole is, like, one of the most sensitive areas on your body.  Never, never, never.  That dick and balls is just set up for very minimal things.  Pissing, fucking, getting jerked, the balls getting juggled around a little bit.  And making bat wings. 
[03:49:30]  Bat wings are fine.  Don't forget bat wings.  That's it.  Airplane.  Airplane.  Docking.  Airplane's fine.  You ever take that, take the loose skin around the side of your wiener and pull them out  like wings and go, make him turn?  What, are you trying to get a kid to suck it?  Open up.  Here comes the plane.  Fucking creep.  You ever make your dick disappear?  Yes.  Inside the mouth of an invalid. 
[03:50:00]  As they're laying there going,  That sucker will push inward if you do it right.  No way.  Oh, yeah.  There's no way I could get my dick to push in me.  Well, maybe you couldn't.  There's a fucking giant fat cock.  Love having a big fat cock.  Big fat hiney wrecker you're walking around with.  Let's go to Mark in Houston.  Hiney wrecker.  And we got a split cock guy standing by, but first Mark in Houston.  Mark, what's up? 
[03:50:30]  Yeah, hey.  No, my ex-wife used to do a thing.  She would, she called it a dick queef.  She would do it, she would blow into my piss hole.  And when she moved her mouth away, she'd stick her thumb over and let it out.  It would fart like a, you know, kind of like a pussy queef.  Sounds like an enchanting relationship.  Doesn't seem kind of neat.  That doesn't seem possible.  No, it felt kind of neat, actually.  Doesn't seem possible, but how many guys are going to try this now?  There's a few out there.  There's a few. 
[03:51:00]  We want a recording of that.  Yeah.  All right, thanks, sir.  That'll be high pitch.  Yeah, let's go to Greg in Cleveland.  Greg, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I knew this woman who used to work in an emergency room back before Viagra and everything.  And they had some, like, 80-year-old man come in there one time complaining.  And he had eight pipe cleaners shoved in there trying to keep it hard.  What?  You can bend it into different shapes.  Poor old fella. 
[03:51:30]  Poor old codger.  Poor guy.  All right, let's talk to Rob from North Carolina.  Rob, what's up?  What do you got?  Hey, what's up going on, guys?  You actually have a sub-incision, which is the split cock.  What's it called, buddy?  No, I actually have a split cock.  Oh, why?  Well, I know it's awesome.  Why?  Well, why?  It's hard to explain.  I actually have the sounding, the shoving metal things in there and stuff.  And if you split up a little bit, you can fit more in.  Oh, that logic, of course.  Well, Rob, you're not explaining why.  Like, you're talking to a lot of guys right now. 
[03:52:00]  And how does it get to a point where you decide, how do you get to a point where you decide,  I want a split cock?  I've seen a few pictures of the split cock, and not even a thought of ever attempting this.  No.  Yeah, I had a lot of gentle piercings.  I used to be a piercer for about four years.  I do sideshow performance now.  And I've just seen a lot of guys.  Just figured it'd be cool to do it.  And I did it, and I really enjoyed it.  How'd you do it?  How'd you split your cock?  It's an underground surgeon type of guy.  And it's just a scalpel you cut, and you sew the sides together, and it splits. 
[03:52:30]  How much does that hurt?  I get to see three people just to get a Xanax prescription.  Body modification people.  And it goes, cut me, or just choke it half like it.  That's funny, man.  You know, that's a tough one to write off on fucking insurances and medical necessity.  I had to get my dick split.  Do you have to use a rubber?  It would be weird to have some kind of fetish or whatever like that, that even me and Norton  go, I don't get it. 
[03:53:00]  Yeah, what the fuck?  I can see a little log in the mouth.  How do you fuck with a split dick?  You carry around rubber bands?  So, you know, I still get hard, still normal.  But it's not tipped like in the end.  It's sort of...  Hold on, dude, but when it gets hard, what the fuck's going on?  It's split.  Oh, no, it's not split all the way.  So it still gets hard.  Like a hot dog in a microwave type of thing.  Yeah, but what about the tip?  Like, that doesn't get hard, right?  Don't you feel it?  Yeah, blood flow still goes there.  And aren't you worried that...  It smells like a moray eel. 
[03:53:30]  Well, I'm thinking if it's split already and you're having sex, aren't you worried that  the damn thing's going to tear?  No, not really.  I mean, it's fully healed up, so...  We've all, you know, we've all went for that piece of skin on the side of our nail and  decided, oh, I could take this off.  Next thing you know, you've got a long red strip all the way down to your elbow.  Ow!  Ow!  I'm just thinking, having a lot of sex with a split cock, you know, it's got to tear. 
[03:54:00]  Well, also, sex feels a lot better, because urethra, yeah, it's a little sensitive, so  sex just feels a lot better for me as well.  I love that.  Sex feels better.  Sex is great the way it is.  I don't have to chop my cock into.  Rob, we're really trying to get into your brain here, though.  Chris on Long Island, he asked, and we asked, and you're still not helping us out here.  He goes, what makes people do this?  Like, all right, there's a ton of people that do piercings.  Yeah.  So it's one step further.  That's more than one.  People are trying to cut a slippery slope. 
[03:54:30]  Yeah, it's almost a slippery slope theory.  I mean, I'm not going to split it anymore.  I mean, I like where it is now.  But it's just something different, and I really enjoyed it, so good thing.  It's almost like cutting your dick off, or like wanting to cut your dick off, almost.  Yeah, you have a vein.  I'm not seeing what we have done, yeah.  Dude, you have a vein in your dick, right?  Well, there's people that are into that, too.  I'm not into that.  Yes.  Yeah, we did the amputee fetish on the show.  It was hilarious.  Wait, sir, let me ask you.  This I don't get.  Like, you know how when you come and you piss, there's a hole.  There's like the urethra.  How do you avoid splitting that? 
[03:55:00]  Like, how do you know you're not going to cut it like a straw?  Oh, no, no.  The urethra is split.  Do you cum like a blender bus?  Well, no, you know, I cum.  All right, so let's...  I guess I'm going to be job sexism, so.  Girl gives me pleasure with her mouth.  You could say whatever you want.  She gives you a fucking blowjob.  Exactly.  Give me a fucking blowjob.  You know, I cum.  Fucking cum on the chin.  She doesn't have to swallow.  It just hits her face automatically.  Because the shoot, the actual hole's near the base, near the balls. 
[03:55:30]  Somewhat.  So it actually...  The hole?  So you did it to be a gentleman.  A gentleman.  You cum out of the hole that's kind of near your balls?  Oh, no, no.  I mean, the urethra goes all the way in.  Yeah, I'm on the urethra.  I'm still at work.  Yeah.  But when you shoot, you're shooting like halfway down your dick.  Yeah, pretty much.  That's fucked up right there.  She must look like she's wearing a scuba regulator. 
[03:56:00]  Sucking both halves of your cock going over her teeth one way and the other.  She's in the middle going, what do you want from me?  What do you guys want to have?  All right there.  Thanks, Rob.  I'll see you guys soon, so I'll show it to you.  You guys can...  Oh, great.  I can't wait.  I can't wait.  Thanks.  You guys can't wait.  All right.  Let's say hi to Marcus in Asheville.  Marcus, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, kid, Bootsy.  What's up, dude? 
[03:56:30]  Hey, when I was a kid growing up, there was this religious family that lived across the street, right?  And so anyway, this kid was in the bathtub, and he kept pushing his penis in and kept pushing it in and kept pushing it in.  Anyway, the little thing didn't come out, and the mom had to go in, and she tried pulling it and tried getting it out.  Anyway, he ended up at the hospital, and they had tweezers trying to go pick this thing out, man.  But pretty crazy.  So you can push it in, but it could also get stuck, we're learning today. 
[03:57:00]  As a kid, maybe.  She should have put her mouth over it and, like, given some suction, and that probably would have popped it back out.  Well, she should have put things in his asshole and pushed them in and out really quickly.  Happened.  A fucking screwdriver and a hammer.  Flicked his nipple, showed him tinkle videos, so his little weenie just popped out naturally.  So, Doug, how's Butters?  I just see him on my message board.  I don't go out when I'm in town.  But he sends me emails saying he wants to come over and make us tamales, and I don't write back. 
[03:57:30]  Why would you?  You're not hanging with Butters these days, huh?  Yeah, Butters doesn't understand.  I don't really have much to say to 20-year-old kids that are standing in the closet banging on the door.  Yeah.  That's true.  Butters is peeking at a cock through the fucking letter slot door, and he's sticking his tongue out, and he can almost get the piss slip, but not quite. 
[03:58:00]  All right.  Doug, so I'm hearing good things about your Showtime special.  Oh, yeah.  Congratulations, man.  Oh, thanks, man.  Yeah, it looks like shit.  It's edited weird, but the jokes are the jokes.  You comedians are never happy how they film stuff for you.  It looks like shit, edited like shit, but the jokes are good.  Like, doing cutaways to my cigarette or my beer, like, that makes it crazy. 
[03:58:30]  That's artsy, man.  I'm looking for that cigarette.  I wish I knew how to do shit like that.  I'd do it myself, but...  The funniest thing is the virus tour when Otto and George were up, and they do a complete isolation face shot on Otto as he's talking for George.  George, you know, Otto's not the best ventriloquist when it comes to, you know, not moving his mouth. 
[03:59:00]  So they would show him, and he's talking like George, but they're not even showing the puppet.  Louis C.K. said it just looks like an angry porno movie.  He's just yelling at himself.  I hate when they just show the puppet.  They should just show fucking Otto and George.  Yeah.  It's two of them.  Yeah, exactly.  Hey, uh, we go to meatspin.com, of course.  We got a woman fucking a guy's pisshole with a dildo.  Go to meatspin.com, Eric.  Whoever goes to meatspin voluntarily, it's E-Rock's job. 
[03:59:30]  Where is it?  All right, so don't send people with fake links.  Email me a link to that one.  That's...  Ha ha ha.  Talk fucking.  Strap on.  There he is.  See, it's the guy on the cover, he's getting fucked in the ass, and his dick is spinning  around and around.  The guy's a fucking...  It's a girl.  It's a tranny.  It's a guy, though.  Oh, because of the tan lines, you can tell it's a tranny?  No.  Wow, we got duped again. 
[04:00:00]  I know.  I can't believe that's my favorite site, and I always get duped when I go there.  I get duped into jerking off.  Go to fingerslam.com.  Uh, since I'm going to meatspin.  You don't want to go to meatspin.  You never want to go to meatspin.  Well, if you want to see a spinning meat.  Oh, my God.  Damn it.  Wow.  What's going on there?  Damn it.  What is that?  It looks like...  Doug, go right to fingerslam.com.  Damn it.  Fingerslam. 
[04:00:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It's kind of like SummerSlam, except the girl's fingering a guy's dick hole.  Oh, shit.  Two fucking fingers.  Two fingers in his...  Yeah.  Are you talking business?  Well, that guy...  That guy sounds like the caller we just had on the air, where his dick is split just enough  where a girl could do this.  Oh, my God.  That, uh...  There's your showstopper today.  That guy's a huge hog, too.  She's holding it in one hand. 
[04:01:00]  There's like a foot sticking out, and she's fingering...  The whole thing's fucking...  You better have a huge one.  Yeah.  Finger slam.  I gotta spread this around.  What do your fingers smell like when you're done with this?  I hope she, uh...  I hope she, like, cut her nails beforehand.  Man busted trying to build a nuke reactor with smoke detectors.  Did the thing go up in his face, or does he have bad acne?  Well, I think the radiation might have gotten to him.  Radioactive Boy Scout. 
[04:01:30]  David...  In charge of, uh...  Stealing 16 smoke detectors.  I know there's some radioactive part in the smoke detectors, but, uh...  How much would you need to make some kind of a reactor?  Man, that guy...  He looks like Fan with measles.  Wow, that guy got fucked up.  Yeah.  Cool.  Mmm.  He's gonna grow, and his hair's gonna fall out.  Urgh.  All right, let's go to...  50-foot man.  Be able to put a whole chick up your dickhole. 
[04:02:00]  Hey, let's go to Brian in Jersey.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  I saw a video of just a girl jamming her two fingers,  her middle finger and index finger, up the b-hole, so...  That's what we're looking at right now.  Fingerslam.com.  Okay.  Well, never mind, then.  Oh, okay.  I thought you had more to it.  Hold on a minute.  Now, I don't know if that's real or fake.  Go back to that.  What, fingerslam?  Let me tell you what makes it...  Oh, oh.  The fact is, she's holding his cock,  but...  It's probably real, 
[04:02:30]  but you can't see where his cock connects with his body.  That's true.  I was thinking that, but...  Her hand is blocking where the cock...  I'm gonna think anything to say that's fake.  Maybe that is real.  Oh, you know what makes it real?  The vein in the bottom of his dick.  That looks like a hard dick.  Ow.  Oh, God.  That looks fucking painful.  That looks...  It's funny if he's dead.  Yeah.  Man, it could be.  Well, wouldn't be the first time  we saw one of those, right?  Seemores like that.  You know, I used to have a fantasy  when I was a little kid  about girls.  And, you know,  I was always into girls my own age.  You know?  So, when I was seven,  I was into girls that were like seven years old. 
[04:03:00]  And when I was like...  I was never watching TV  and like one of those kids  that were into I Dream of Jeannie.  To me, she was like an old lady.  I wasn't into that.  So, when I was like 10,  I was into 10-year-old.  That's how it worked.  So, I think when I was about 10 years old,  I had this fantasy of a girl  that was about...  about four inches tall.  Totally naked.  And I wanted to put her in my mouth  and then just pull her out of my mouth  and kind of suck on her like a lollipop. 
[04:03:30]  You want it to be Danny from The Shining.  Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.  She's the little whore  that lives in my throat.  But I wanted to do that  with her completely naked  but really little.  What's wrong with you?  I don't know.  That was just a fantasy  that popped up  when I mentioned like a little...  I love the new Anthony  that just decided out of nowhere  to start sharing some weird shit with us.  It's a little weird  but it's like a tiny little, you know...  This has been happening  for the last couple months.  You're just sharing these weird things.  She'd be tiny  but completely naked 
[04:04:00]  and alive  and completely like, you know,  soft and everything  and I would put her in my mouth  and just go like,  mmm, mmm,  and then pop her out of my mouth  gently, you know,  and she'd like it  and I, you know,  thought it was cool.  What's that about?  Bukowski had a short story about that.  Wait a minute.  I think that is...  Okay, I'm sorry.  Oh, no.  Bukowski had a short story  called Six Inches,  I believe,  where it was about  how his girlfriend  told him he was fat  and told him  how to punch himself  in the sides 
[04:04:30]  to lose his love handles  and he gradually got smaller  and smaller  until he was only six inches  and then she used to  fuck herself with him.  But, uh,  my story.  I think that Anthony's...  I want to know...  That's all right.  I want to know of Anthony's dream  that the little girl  you were putting in your mouth,  was she standing, like,  in a thatch of grass  with two beanbag chairs  in front of her?  No. 
[04:05:00]  It was a girl,  not a weenie.  And it was just the thought  that, like,  I would feel  all of a naked girl's body  all on my tongue  at the same time.  Like, her ass,  her stomach,  legs,  everything,  all at the same time.  And that was like  a kid fantasy I had.  Okay, terrific.  It went away after a while.  I thought it was pretty cool  for a kid.  Yeah. 
[04:05:30]  I thought it was pretty cool  for a kid,  a little fantasy.  It's wrong.  It doesn't matter.  It's just weird.  It is weird.  I'm not saying  it's not weird.  All right, you guys.  Blow kids under the porch.  That's what I'm saying.  Now you get to the hot stuff.  Listen,  there's a challenge  going on here.  At least I just took  their little dicks  in my mouth  and called it a day.  I didn't want to  devour their souls.  The listeners  are challenging us  because they saw 
[04:06:00]  a finger slam.  They're like,  fuck that.  Go to swollen tip.com.  No.  No,  not swollen tip.com.  Doug,  are you playing along  at home?  Yeah, yeah.  That's got to be  really bad.  Let's go to  swollen tip.com.  Tip.  Get the fuck.  Come on,  stop it.  Stop it.  That's like a fucking  big white dildo  or something  and it is being crammed  in the guy's dick hole.  Yeah,  this is the first one  I saw, yeah.  This was on my 
[04:06:30]  memory board, yeah.  Let me tell you what.  It's obviously the same guy  because you can tell  it's the same people  that run the website  because the same ads  are on it.  Yeah, yeah.  Holy shit.  This guy, yeah.  He's gleaming it.  Oh, yeah,  and she's got the ring  on the same finger.  You're right.  Those are the two fingers  she was using  to put into her.  It's like she's  searching for something.  She probably is,  a guy who's not  an asshole.  She's trying to  fish her engagement  ring out of the drain.  She's got gum  on the end of it.  I like how it's on her face. 
[04:07:00]  She's not giggling  or anything.  No.  Yeah, there's no irony there.  Oh, too.  All right, here's a...  Wow, that's nasty.  How about Discharge.org.  Go.  Discharge.org.  Come on, E-Rock.  Stop running around  fucking looking  for gay porn  for your own stuff.  That isn't a military site.  We'll soon find out.  Discharge.org  is on the way here.  E-Rock is so slow.  He's so slow with these.  And all our listeners  get to it first. 
[04:07:30]  I thought he was there  when I said that.  E-Rock?  Come on, E.  Where were you, E-Rock?  What were you getting?  He was getting water.  Oh, you got it?  He was getting water  because he gets all nervous.  You got it?  Because E-Rock  had to get water  even though he knew  we were kind of  surfing here.  This is like a medical site.  All right.  I had to get water.  I don't have one of those chicks  that checks the history  and then starts blaming you. 
[04:08:00]  Not all the shit  you licked at?  Yeah.  Clear history.  I was going to put out  a red alert to my girlfriend.  Don't pop these sites on.  Our computer needs updating.  There's going to be like  some viruses.  Hey, is there a way  for your chick  to find your history  if you delete it?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's still in the  Windows temporary folder.  How about in your Mac?  In the Mac?  It's even worse.  I have no clue  where the hell  they reside over there. 
[04:08:30]  I don't do anything.  You should play it safe  and just throw out  computers every three months.  Three months?  Just like daily.  When you're getting  your brand new sneakers,  throw out your computer.  Just drop them in acid.  Right.  Just throw it out  and start over.  All right.  Let's say hi to Michael.  Wow.  From Asheville again.  Michael, what's up?  Hey, Yone.  Love you guys.  I love the show.  Thanks.  What about Doug Stanhope?  I was going to tell him  I had kind of the same  dream or imagination 
[04:09:00]  that he did.  I used to do it in reverse.  I used to fantasize  that I could be  four or five inches tall  and then I'd climb up  inside the girl  and just kind of  wall around up in there.  Oh, really?  In her mouth?  No.  Oh, in her pussy.  You would go in her...  Like you would...  Wow, that's odd.  I never fantasized  about that.  I've been putting  the whole girl  in your mouth.  Come on, man.  No, it isn't.  It isn't.  I love Michael.  He's sticking up  yours is weirder 
[04:09:30]  because you'd be like  in a vagina.  Hold on.  Let's ask Jimmy  which one's weirder.  Jimmy?  Yeah, come on, dude.  I don't know.  Miniature girl  in your mouth,  the whole girl  in your mouth  or miniature dude  walking around  inside a girl's vagina.  I wanted to feel  the wonderfulness  of a girl,  complete wonderfulness  in my mouth.  Every bit of it.  Yeah, but you wanted  to be surrounded  by a pussy  and just sit in it  like it's a big  velvet chair  that happens to stink. 
[04:10:00]  Who wants to lounge  in a pussy?  Oh!  Oh, God!  Look at this video!  Holy shit!  I'm punching out.  This guy is getting  kicked in the balls.  So get ready.  You ready?  Go to...  I'm ready.  ManGems.com  M-A-N-G-E-M-S  M-A-N-G-E-M-S  This fucking guy  is getting kicked  and elbowed over...  Not elbowed...  Need.  Need, sorry. 
[04:10:30]  Over and over again  in the balls.  And these are not  being pulled.  Well, you know,  the kicks.  They're not being pulled.  Oh, we are fucking up  the 92.3 KROQ  computers today.  Good luck  to get all these  viruses out.  There you go,  ManGems.  I love that all of these  are on a loop,  so it looks like  there's no closure.  It never ends.  It's like hell.  That's what hell  would be like.  Yeah, the guy only  took probably like  four shots  and they looped it  to make it look.  Yeah, still. 
[04:11:00]  Look at what a pussy  he doesn't even  have a heart on.  I know.  What a dope.  I never lose my rod  if a knee or a shoe  goes into it.  My balls and dick  laugh at that.  That's a good one.  I can take three fingers  in my cock hole,  by the way.  Can you?  Yes, I can.  And then you can even  do like the little  expansion.  Open up a little.  Get that webbing.  I kind of wish  the dominatrixes  would do  like stuff  like prostate exams,  all the shit  I'm supposed to do  now that I'm 40.  I'll never do. 
[04:11:30]  I'll die of those  diseases because  it's way too gross.  But if a dominatrix  did it,  if she was going to  give me like a flu shot  or check my prostate  and make it dirty.  Or stick some up  your ass.  Like if she would  check it for real.  Like if she would  check your prostate  for real  and then just  shit in your mouth.  Oh, by the way,  Squeaky Wheel  from Columbus,  please isolate  and edit.  And I wanted  to feel the  wonderfulness of it  in my mouth.  Oh, well, 
[04:12:00]  I was talking  about a young  woman when  I was a kid.  That's all right,  dude.  I just wanted  to feel everything.  Legs.  Ken from Westchester.  Why wouldn't  that be nice?  No.  Ken from Westchester.  Ken.  As a matter of fact,  at all nice.  What's up, Ken?  Hey, what's up?  It's Ken from Westchester.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, hey, man.  Hey, listen, I got  this condition, right?  It's called  a urethra dilation.  Once a month,  I have to go  to the doctor  and they shove  rods in me  starting from  the size of your pinky  to the size of 
[04:12:30]  a little bit bigger  than your thumb.  They're about  12 inches long  and the girth  is just outrageous.  They have to  shove it in  and fucking  spread the hole  back open  because the urethra  closes up on its own.  And this is  some kind of  disease you could have?  Yeah.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Doug.  Doug.  Hold on there, Ken.  We'll get back to you.  Go to  mudfall.com.  Go. 
[04:13:00]  What is it?  Mudfall.  Mudfall.com.  Go there.  Oh, my God.  It looks like he's  trying to start  his asshole  as an engine  and it's just  sputtering out  engine oil  all over the face  of an Asian.  It's like a fucking  harrier hovering.  You there?  That is horrible.  Doug, you there?  Yeah, I get it.  There's an Asian girl  on her back  with her mouth open  and there's an asshole  right over her 
[04:13:30]  and it's firing out  like a yellow  greenish diarrhea shit  onto her chin  and face.  It's wonderful.  It's like pure  wasabi coming out  of his ass.  Oh.  All right,  are we going to  move on to the next one?  Damn, man.  All right,  you ready, E-Rock?  You got to be quick  on this one.  Yeah, be quick, E-Rock.  Ken, hold on.  We're going to get  back to you  because I've never  heard of this condition  before,  but hold on one sec.  All right.  Go to  ready, E-Rock?  Let's see how fast  you can type.  TheShithole.com.  Why don't you go to 
[04:14:00]  just fucking boom  and XM pops up?  All right, then  what's that?  And scroll down.  Once you recover...  Uh-oh.  Go to the  mega shit bath  extravaganza.  Wow.  That's a nice one.  Holy Jesus.  Oh, my God.  It's just  people shitting  on people  and smearing it.  Keep going.  That doesn't have  a lot of shit.  This is what you hate  is those...  Oh, my God. 
[04:14:30]  Asian girls  always smile  when they do this.  They smile.  They have this  big, wide smile.  Keep going.  Keep going.  I mean, Amber...  If you don't get  to a trailer, Eric,  I'm going to cry.  Just keep going.  Keep going.  Yeah, I want to  see a movie.  Oh, my God.  A scat princess  is holding a fucking  mouthful of nude.  Keep going.  Keep going.  A nude nude.  Oh, my God.  Look at this.  Keep going.  No, don't...  He's opening a movie.  We've got to see the movie.  Yeah, but look at  Scat Race Queen Part 2. 
[04:15:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Oh, get the fuck out of here.  It's being shit.  There's green stuff  like pea soup  into a bowl.  Go all the way down.  I want to see all the pictures  before we decide  which one to pop on.  And then it goes  into someone's face,  the bowl.  Keep going.  That is disgusting.  Who is into this shit?  Fucking...  Oh, my God.  She is covered in shit.  It's her own duty hat.  It's a duty hat video.  It's for real.  Who the hell  is into this? 
[04:15:30]  Keep going.  Holy shit,  is this funny.  Like, is anyone  into this sexually  or do they just watch it  to laugh?  Because it is funny.  Milky Wet Scat Dreams.  There's someone laying there  getting some Milky Wet  Scat shot on them.  Wow.  As per the title.  Keep going.  Keep going.  This is the comic relief porn  that I jerk off to,  that I look at after I jerked off  to something that's really sick  that I'm into.  Then I go to something  and go,  ha ha,  someone's into it.  It has nothing to do  with sexy. 
[04:16:00]  All right.  That is...  No.  You don't like the shit head?  I want to see her tip that  to be polite.  Good day to you, too.  No one makes the shit head  so fucking funny  is the height of the shit head.  Oh, it's just massive.  Her head is way down.  Massive amount.  Her head is way down.  But the biggest logs ever,  by the way.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Uh, yes.  I've just heard about this site.  Oh, okay.  Oh, boy. 
[04:16:30]  You need a pen, Jimmy?  There you go.  Jimmy's going to jot it.  Write it down.  Jot it down.  Jot it down.  I think we're going to get  a little video action here  any second now.  I see it downloading.  K-Rock's going to kick us  out of the studio soon.  Oh, they are?  Oh, you got to think.  This can't be good  for the computers.  It's funny.  This can't be good  for the computers.  These are all in Tom's favorites.  Tom's a scat fiend.  Scat.  He likes this.  Tie shitting. 
[04:17:00]  That fucking shit hat  will make me laugh all day.  All fucking day.  A big, heavy shit hat  that's leaking  down the side of her head.  Like she went to lean in  and go, how do you do it?  And it started to leak.  Like, miss, your hat is morphing.  It's like a big top hat.  Isn't that horrible?  She's kind of putting on the Ritz.  Instead of wearing a tux,  somebody's shit on her head.  She's putting on the shits.  Here we go.  When you've been beaten  and molested your whole life,  putting on the shits.  Oh, here she goes. 
[04:17:30]  Oh, my God.  She's got a bowl full of shit  and she is rubbing it  all over her body.  I love when some of these  in some of these porn movies  they're doing something  so horrific  and the porn star  will attempt to make it  look like she's really into it  but you can just see  you can see right through it  that she is beyond disgusting too.  Well, obviously  they're good actresses.  They wouldn't be doing  this type of film.  And she said,  you know what it is?  The bowl,  she was dumping on herself.  She misunderstood the quote.  It said,  life's a bowl of cherries. 
[04:18:00]  And she just misunderstood  the rest of it  because she's Asian.  And it's good  that they beep out  the pubic hair.  They're pixelating  the pubic hair.  Like, that's the problem  with this video.  Pubies are dirty.  Lovely culture.  Just amazing.  Oh.  All right.  Hey, let's go back  to Ken Westchester.  So Ken has this condition  where they have to  stick crap in his urethra  because it closes up.  And some of the instruments  are as thick as a thumb. 
[04:18:30]  Yeah, no kidding.  And how often  do you have to have it  re-reamed?  Well, let's put it this way.  When it first happened to me,  I had to go every week  for six months  to have this done.  It's nine rods.  One that starts  as the size of your pinky,  the whip I'm talking.  Right, right.  And it works your way up to  stretch it.  Yeah.  They stick it in  and they like fucking twist it  to stretch it back open  because the tissue  on the head  scars back down.  So now they got me 
[04:19:00]  to one month.  What was the name  of the condition?  It's called  urethra dilation.  Now, I was doing research  on it on the internet  so I can show people  what the fuck I go through  because everybody says to me,  oh, it can't be that bad.  And the only documentation  on the internet  is like doctors' pictures  and books rather  of drawings.  And they just show  like a little stick  inside the dick hole  which is fucking,  you know,  ponderous compared  to what they do to me.  It's crazy.  Dude, how'd you know  there was a problem?  Like you would try to piss 
[04:19:30]  and what,  your dick would blow up  like a balloon?  Or you want to get into it,  I'll get into it.  I'll try to be as quick  as possible.  One morning after  a long night of drinking  I woke up,  dude,  could not fucking piss.  I fucking looked down,  I'm weary-headed,  I got to hang over.  My hole was gone.  Just gone.  Not there no more.  Just gone.  Wow.  Your piss hole was gone.  It was over?  Yeah, it was like  somebody fucking  started it off.  It was gone.  I guess, you know,  it's kind of like  when you had an earring 
[04:20:00]  and you decide  the earring wasn't cool anymore  so you took it out  and then like  the earring comes back  it's cool again  so you're like,  you know what,  I have an earring hole  I'm going to fucking  put my earring back in  and then you realize  that earring hole's gone  and you got to  poke it through.  Your piss hole disappeared.  I swear to God  this is no shit.  I mean,  I went to the emergency room.  Mind you,  I was drinking all night  so my bladder  feels like it's going to explode  so they take me in  right away  to the emergency room  and it was the most  embarrassing thing  of my life.  I got two nurses  and a fucking doctor  who looked like an intern  trying to fucking 
[04:20:30]  use a scalpel  to reopen the hole.  I'm sitting there  with the hole.  They're like,  here,  control your morphine drip.  I'm like,  okay,  but turn that fucker up  as much as I can  and I'm fucking high as hell  and I got my poor  pregnant wife  sitting next to me  throughout this whole thing  and they finally  were about to  wheel me into the OR  to cut my belly open,  I guess,  to put a catheter  in that way  and then thank God,  luck,  fucking the urologist  on call  walked in there,  threw everybody  out of the room 
[04:21:00]  and he was able  to get a catheter  in me,  drained like fucking  two bags of fucking  piss out of me  and then put a catheter  in me for three days.  I went to his office,  he did the procedure  for the first time  and let me tell you,  I cleared out his waiting room  because I was fucking  screaming so loud.  Oh,  wow.  It's horrendous,  man.  I mean,  if I don't know  what causes it,  it just happens.  It happens mostly  in older gentlemen,  let's say,  that maybe go through  it once a year  just to make sure  everything is okay. 
[04:21:30]  I'm 33 years old.  No,  I'm 32 years old.  This happened to me  when I was 28,  29.  There's no drug  in the world  that can prevent you  from screaming  on that thing.  No,  dude,  well,  I mean,  they know,  oh,  here,  take a couple of  Vicodin before you  come in,  you know,  that'll help  and they inject  Laticane in  to numb it up,  which it works  for the first two rods  and then that's it,  forget it.  As long as I've been  doing it,  you know,  it's over two years now,  you'd think I'd be  used to it,  you ain't getting  used to it  no matter fucking what.  Will it heal eventually?  They don't,  they say that 
[04:22:00]  it can be cured  with surgery.  I guess they  stitch it open somehow,  but this doctor  is saying to me  that,  well,  you're a young guy,  if you fuck it up  and it don't work,  then you're gonna  have to come here  every fucking week  for the rest of your life.  I'd rather wait  and I'm thinking  how much longer  do you want to wait,  dude?  It's been like  two years.  It was two years in May.  How much longer  do you want to wait  because this is starting  to get out of hand?  Just have an implant  a straw or something  in there.  Like one of the ones  where you can bend  the neck?  Yeah, 
[04:22:30]  bendable straws.  Bendable straws?  How comfortable  do you think  that would feel,  guys?  I mean,  I don't know  what you're going through.  Well,  at this point,  but I mean,  that can't be comfortable,  I don't think.  Too bad that's like,  you would have won  the what the hell  is that,  competition.  Oh,  hell yeah.  That's a biggie right there.  Disappearing pisshole.  Disappearing pisshole  beats everything.  Magic.  Don't tell me that.  I'll come in there  with a fucking rod tomorrow  and shove it in.  Okay.  Give me a buck.  How much rod  can you take  at this point? 
[04:23:00]  These things,  I'm telling you,  I have pictures  of my fucking email  on the Travis  or whoever.  I have pictures of rods.  I'm telling you,  they're 12 inches long  and the longest one,  the girth,  I'm telling you,  it's wider than your thumb.  Look at your thumb  and just think of  of it round,  totally round.  And he jams them in  like all the fucking way.  I mean,  it's like,  it's got to be touching  my bladder at this point.  It's not comfortable.  I was going to come in  because that for a while  because they had me  doing it every week 
[04:23:30]  and then they were like,  well,  come back every two weeks  but here's an at-home kit  you can use.  And I'm like,  what?  They're like,  oh,  do it every two days.  I'm like,  okay.  So they give me  this little plastic one.  It's probably about,  you know,  four or five inches long  and it starts off  from skinny  and it gets to be  probably about the width  of your index finger maybe.  And my wife was doing it  to me  because I can't  fucking do it myself.  See,  again,  this is a perfect place  for dominatrix health care.  Good luck to you.  It would be way better  if some chick  in a latex skirt  was making you 
[04:24:00]  eat her ass  while she,  I'm going to jam this  down your cockle  if you don't eat my ass good.  It would be better.  I didn't think  it was going to be good enough  for the,  what the hell is that contest?  Doug,  he's onto something here.  Dominatrix health care.  I like it.  Make those freaky things  a little easier.  At the very least,  it should be the name  of a punk band or something.  Just write a fucking book.  All right, Ken,  thank you.  We're looking at the video  right now  of the bald guy  ramming his head  into the vagina.  It looks like Bob Kelly  attacking an ice cream cake. 
[04:24:30]  That is so fake, dude.  Yeah, that's fake.  No, it's real, I swear.  All right, Doug,  we're going to go.  Hey, thanks for having me.  Hi, this is Doug Stanhope.  You can find my shit  at DougStanhope.com.  Or MySpace slash Doug Stanhope  or YouTube  or all the other places.  Please pirate my stuff  and pass it around  to your friends.  It's the only way  that I'll ever be heard of.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony  on your radio dial.  Radio dial. 
[04:25:00]  We got the great  Brian Regan stopping by  a really good friend  of the radio show.  Yes.  And Brian sits down  and goes,  so how you guys been?  And we just basically  said good  because we want to  kind of save it  for the air.  It's been some changes, Brian.  Oh, all right.  My pal Anthony  pretty much losing his mind.  He's now single.  I don't know why  it's I'm losing my mind.  Oh, don't look so shocked.  Oh, wow.  Sorry?  Oh, sorry to hear that.  What?  Why?  Why am I sorry?  It's like a normal thing  you're supposed to say 
[04:25:30]  after something like that, right?  That's like...  But is it?  Yeah.  Because sometimes  it's like,  you know,  sometimes it's like,  you know,  it's probably all for the best.  Well, it depends on...  You're expecting Brian  to go,  well, it's about time!  On who?  Of course, Brian is...  You know,  who dumps who?  No, Brian's going to take  the I'm sorry to hear  that angle  because that's Brian Regan.  I'm sorry to hear that.  Other people might be going,  well,  saw this coming years ago.  Patrice was like,  what did you wait for?  What?  Why did you wait? 
[04:26:00]  But Anthony,  you know,  long-term relationship  is now over  and we find out  that he was at a lesbian bar  over the weekend.  Wow.  Well,  you know...  Congratulations.  And...  I'm now a lesbian.  And we were all...  We were all,  like,  we didn't do much with it  when he just casually says this  during the last break  because we all know Anthony  and we're like,  what is going on  that all of a sudden  you went from  being a recluse  to going to a lesbian bar?  Like,  what is going on?  And we don't know 
[04:26:30]  how to,  like,  handle this one.  That's what happens.  It's just all this.  That's the normal thing.  I've broken up before.  You go to a lesbian bar.  Right.  That's the first thing you do.  That's the first thing you do.  It's like when you get fired,  you go to the corner pub  and drink a little bit.  That's right.  After a breakup,  you hit the local lesbian bar.  You go to the local lesbian bar.  The local lesbian bar.  Yeah,  that's the one right down the street.  You don't want to go cross down.  You hit the local one.  You do the one around the corner.  You go to the local lesbian bar 
[04:27:00]  and hopefully you don't see her  with her face buried  in a pair of dungarees.  That's right next to the local Irish pub,  right, Brian?  It's right there.  That's right.  It's part of Restaurant Row.  It's just,  you know,  you have a little fun  on the weekends.  You go out.  I think for the first time,  Jimmy and I were pretty much speechless.  We're like,  what?  Was that with some people?  What?  That was some people  who knew some people.  That was a little fun  on the weekends.  I've had fun on the weekends.  I didn't end up there. 
[04:27:30]  Yeah.  Well,  I played a little golf,  you know,  went to Hooters  for a couple pitchers.  That's my definition of fun.  You know,  some Scrabble.  You should play Scrabble.  I'll give,  maybe I'll give that a word  this weekend.  This weekend,  play some Scrabble.  You'll have just as much fun.  Andy,  the four-letter word  for lesbians.  I don't have a U.  You do have a D. 
[04:28:00]  And,  yeah,  just,  you know,  it's one of those things.  I just think it's one of those  things that you should  just kind of experience.  Walk in,  see how they are  amongst their own  kind of a thing.  It's like a little  lesbian safari.  How about you,  I don't know,  start out a little slower.  How do you start out slower?  Go to an Irish pub first.  There's plenty of Irish pubs.  I've never been to a  lesbian bar.  It's kind of, 
[04:28:30]  kind of cool,  you know?  I like this new Anthony.  Walk around,  they,  I'll tell you though,  like I was saying,  they look like guys.  It's the oddest  goddamn thing.  And then they're with  some that look like girls.  And,  and then there's me  just looking around going,  hey,  how you doing?  I got one of these.  Were they cool?  Like make you feel welcome  and all that?  Yeah,  very nice,  you know,  very welcome.  It wasn't like the bartender  threw the drink at me.  Like when you go to a birthday party 
[04:29:00]  and they have the big,  like the welcome thing up,  like hanging,  did they have that up there?  Yeah,  welcome guys with penises.  Welcome reason we're like this.  Yeah,  right?  It's just like reassuring to them.  And that one guy in and they go,  see?  I just assumed that,  um,  they must have looked at me  at some point  and thought,  uh,  because of,  of who I was with 
[04:29:30]  at the time,  uh,  they must have thought like,  wow,  she really found a girl  that really can look like a guy.  Grew a beard,  a mustache,  and everything.  Who's the scrawny broad  in that hat?  Bring her over.  Bring over that scrawny broad  doing impressions.  I'm a lesbian twink.  Oh,  she sounds just like Tyson.  She sounds just like  the guy from the  Home Shopping Network.  She's really talented. 
[04:30:00]  Wow.  Yeah,  very,  uh,  so that was fun.  There's been some changes  since the last time I've been here.  Fun.  And then on Friday's show,  I was doing baby diaper mustache,  so everything is,  so everything is a little different.  Yeah,  you kind of.  Everything is,  uh,  quite normal on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Uh,  someone's saying,  you just don't order  the Bloody Mary  at a lesbian bar.  Okay.  See,  take a look at that.  That's,  that's quite normal,  right?  There it is.  Wow. 
[04:30:30]  Yeah.  Uh,  looks nice.  Got your hoodie on?  Yeah.  Yeah,  because I want,  I went into evil mode,  so I had to have a hoodie on.  He's got his rubber gloves on,  and,  uh,  he has what,  um,  was wrapped up in a baby diaper  that he has then smeared  as a mustache.  You sure you want to still do  this radio show?  Like,  what's going on?  I know you want to be legit.  You might want to look  somewhere else finally.  You ain't kidding,  there's been some changes.  We've kind of lost our mind.  Check out these photos, 
[04:31:00]  Brian.  Damn.  I think it's gotten to the point  where like,  wow,  we don't really know what else  to do with this radio show,  so let's start digging into diapers.  Yeah.  It was like a little tiny mustache.  You looked like Schittler.  Now,  I'm kind of naive.  What's the point of the mustache?  What's the...  That is a very good question,  Brian.  Probably the one most asked.  Like,  if I was on,  if I was like Tim Russert  and this was a Meet the Press interview,  I would go,  what's the deal with the mustache? 
[04:31:30]  Well,  uh,  we were bored.  Mm-hmm.  Didn't have much else to do  on that show.  Well,  I was,  I did it as,  uh,  as a,  it's,  it's a long,  well,  I did it as a goof  thinking that I would never  have to do this  and then I got caught  with my pants down.  Mm-hmm.  Because he's never supposed  to leave enough time  for someone to actually  bring in a diaper.  So,  he's supposed to get on the air  and go,  all right,  look,  it's a baby diaper day.  I'm just gonna put it out there.  If you bring one up  before 11, 
[04:32:00]  and usually this is  a quarter to 11.  You have to float those ideas  at quarter of.  That was the bit.  Yeah.  But he did it an hour  and a half  before the show  was gonna be over.  The bit was that  we would never do the bit  and the frustration  that would build  with the listeners  because they really  want to see this happen.  But these guys  behind the scenes  were in cahoots  with each other  and they got,  they got Rich Voss,  you know,  Rich Voss,  to come up with  his baby's diaper  from a couple days ago.  He actually dug  into a garbage pail. 
[04:32:30]  So hence  the baby diaper mustache  which is the  YouTube sensation today.  Wow.  Okay,  Obi wants to reopen  the McMartin Preschool now.  Once you get a taste  for blood.  You got some babies,  right?  Got some babies,  yeah.  Would you ever do  baby diaper mustache?  I don't know  that I would  quite go that far.  I think I would hit  the local lesbian bar.  Right.  Okay.  You gotta do that first  and think things over.  Have some fun.  Good.  And then when, 
[04:33:00]  no,  I haven't gone  that direction yet.  I see there's been  changes with you as well,  Brian.  I see you have some  very nice glasses on.  Yeah.  Very,  very sharp.  Very Hollywood-ish.  Very,  what?  Stylish.  Yeah,  very stylish.  Very fancy schmancy.  Very European-ish.  Very,  that's the brand name  is fancy schmancy.  Fancy schmancy.  Big F-S on the side.  You know,  you're always more daring, 
[04:33:30]  I think,  like when you're buying a shirt  or something like that.  Aren't you like more daring  when you're in the clothing store?  Yeah.  When you see something  that's like a little bit  like you're pushing the envelope.  A little different  than you normally wear.  Yeah,  and you go,  yeah,  you know what,  I'm a cool guy.  I can get away with that shirt.  Fashionable.  And then you get out in public  and you're like,  what the hell is the matter with me?  Well,  that's the deal  with these glasses.  You think you look good?  You're right.  And the first time  I was in an airport  and looked in a mirror  in the restroom,  I'm like,  oh my God, 
[04:34:00]  I look like a jerk.  But I see you're still wearing that.  Then I realized,  maybe I am a jerk.  That's the way they fit,  you know?  I think you look stylish  until you walk down the street  and people yell,  hey, queer.  And throw them tomatoes.  The subtle hint.  Nice glasses,  douche.  Someone is asking,  what does Brian think  of news reporters  changing their accent?  Hey.  Hey.  That's part.  That's a good question, man. 
[04:34:30]  That's part of my new accent.  Well, you know,  the thing is,  I grew up in Miami  where you would see that  and that was normal  to have a newscaster  who had a Spanish accent down there.  Sure.  But what I didn't understand  is when I first went out  on the road  and you'd be like in Ohio,  you know,  and the newscaster's  obviously from the Midwest  and he still throws  the Spanish accent  and I never got that,  you know?  Well, apparently this just in,  some fighting has broken out  down in Nicaragua.  You know,  all of a sudden  he's Julio Iglesias. 
[04:35:00]  We'll be sending a reporter  down to Managua, Nicaragua.  Okay.  Aren't you the frequent flyer  racking up the miles?  But you know what I don't get  is like,  that's politically correct  to do that.  with Spanish.  You know,  anybody can have  a Spanish accent  for one word.  You can't do that  with the Asian stories,  you know?  Well,  the U.S. diplomat  is being sent to Beijing!  That might affect 
[04:35:30]  the situation in Hong Kong!  It's Beijing and Hong Kong!  Hey, honey,  come watch this guy.  He's about to lose his job.  Come hither  into the viewing corridors!  You're never going to see  this guy again!  Yeah, he's done!  He's over now!  Never again with this man!  Why, though?  Why Spanish and not, 
[04:36:00]  you know,  I don't know.  Yeah,  that's not fair.  Never.  It's the only accent  that you can do that with.  That's right.  Nicaragua.  Nicaragua.  Yeah, that's okay.  That's okay.  Spanglish.  Let's say hi to Colin  in Florida.  Colin, what's up?  We're talking to Brian Regan.  Hey,  I actually got started  on O&A on Napster  and have Brian's  first appearance.  Oh,  classic.  It's a bunch of people  calling and complaining  where is the,  where is the music? 
[04:36:30]  Why are people talking?  Where are the previous hosts?  That was the famous  this is not what I'm used to.  This is not what I'm used to.  That was a lot of fun, man.  They were used to a lot of  old rock and roll songs  that we came in  to mess everything up.  You can't change anything.  No.  You can't change anything.  You can have like  the biggest piece  of garbage artwork  up on a wall  and take it down  and put up a Mona Lisa  and people are going to complain 
[04:37:00]  because it's different.  That's not what I saw yesterday.  This is not like yesterday.  I don't,  I don't want today.  I want yesterday  because yesterday I know  and today is new.  It's new.  That's the way people are.  It's scary.  Don't switch,  don't switch anything up, man.  Look how well we handled  the metric system.  Yeah, that worked out well. 
[04:37:30]  We tried for a moment or two.  Scared the daylights  out of everybody, man.  Yeah.  No one wanted that.  They really poured it on  in school too like that.  This is coming.  There's no stopping it.  So start learning it.  We only have five years.  Yeah.  Everything is going to switch over  and you're not going to know  how much milk to buy.  Oh, man.  They were scared.  You know what I think  they should have done  because they gave it,  what, five years?  Yeah.  Or something like that.  They should have given it one day. 
[04:38:00]  I swear.  Just change all the signs,  take down the miles,  put up kilometers.  By the end of the day,  you know what that means.  You better, yeah.  You know, you go 240 kilometers.  I don't know.  What does that mean?  And then you drive it.  You go, okay,  that's what that means.  Now I know.  You don't do five years  because that's eight people  after five years going,  I don't want to change.  Yeah.  I don't want to change.  Or you wait until five years  is just about up  and then finally.  And start cramming,  cramming for that metric.  We're all about cramming, 
[04:38:30]  so you're right.  Just throw it upon us.  Just change it.  Sure.  It's different now.  Just wake up  and that's the first news report  that morning.  You know that system you're used to?  We ain't doing that no more.  Get used to it.  Let's say hi to Glenn in Jersey.  Glenn, what's up?  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, I've listened to you guys  since any W.  Brian Regan is the only comedian  or guest who comes in  and you guys and the fans  have to set up bits for him.  It's the funniest freaking thing.  Well, that just started out  as a joke back in the day.  Yeah, people feel compelled 
[04:39:00]  to do that.  And they decided never to drop it.  Yeah.  Because we would try to set up Brian  and make it sound like  we're being natural.  So, Brian,  did you have Pop-Tarts this morning?  Yeah.  Oh, and my stuff is so bizarre  that how would you  naturally ask any question  that has to do with  anything I talk about?  Right.  Yeah, when you're delayed  on the runway.  Do you ever think  it's because they're  in the cockpit  divvying up?  Brian, have you ever 
[04:39:30]  noticed anything weird  in the Fig Newtons  section of the supermarket?  You know, because of you,  I look at labels now  and, you know, like that,  what did you say?  Like a serving size  is two cookies  is one of the famous lines.  So I look at stuff now  and for fat content,  like, oh, good news,  only 120 calories.  What?  But that's only nine almonds,  almonds or whatever.  they screw with that.  Whatever.  I'm trying to do nothing here.  Let's say hi to Joe  in Brooklyn. 
[04:40:00]  Joe, what's up?  Well, you gave a little  health break.  That was nice.  Now we know more  about almonds.  Well, that's good.  I didn't know the serving size  before I went and saw you,  see, so besides laughing,  I was very educated  on what an actual  serving size is.  Wow.  Can I say my favorite part  of the Pop-Tart bit  is how do I get  this goodness in me?  Such a great line, man.  Let's go to Joe  in Brooklyn.  Joe, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  What's up, Danny?  Good evening. 
[04:40:30]  Brian Regan, bro.  You are the funniest guy  ever.  Thank you, man.  Wow, look at that.  I've been listening to you  since WNEW  and you are the best.  You are very kind, man.  Thank you.  And I just got to say  about that jerk off  in Cleveland.  Maxwell, yes.  Oh, Maxwell, yeah.  Nah, funny.  Nah, funny.  Another radio war  going on, apparently.  We like a good radio war, Brian.  You know how those are, Brian, 
[04:41:00]  constantly in battle.  You're always feuding, man.  Always loving some shills in.  The Hatfields and McCoys here.  Why don't you comedians  have wars with each other?  Why don't you take on  a comedian and go at them?  Because we got to end up  working together.  Yeah.  They're not going to throw you  in the same studio  with these guys.  We got to show up  and be on the same bill  and you don't want to be  on record having said something.  All of a sudden,  backstage, you're like,  awkward.  Said some bad things about you.  Start throwing fists.  Last time I saw Brian, 
[04:41:30]  he had an amazing tour bus  that I was not invited on  to take a look at.  Oh, wow.  What happened there?  Why?  Maybe it's because of your  penchant for diapers.  I didn't realize  you wanted to check it out.  I didn't know you were  in a tour bus.  That was very impressive.  Brand new tour bus  with Brian Reagan.  And they come with  the drugs and the broads.  Do they?  Yeah.  I wonder how they got them.  They have, yeah.  You don't have to pick them up 
[04:42:00]  at the venue.  No, the drugs and the broads.  See, that takes away  from the myth.  I always thought  you had to work something.  No, no, no.  What would Brian Reagan  do on a tour bus, though?  Nilla wafers  and chocolate milk.  Yeah.  And naps.  And a nice Disney film.  Yeah, fun books.  I'm going to get  a little wild.  I'm going to watch  in the back.  I'm going to watch  a Disney film  in my boxes.  What are you guys  talking about?  We got Etch-a-Sketches.  We got Swinkies.  None of that lame stuff.  Six-pack of Near Beer 
[04:42:30]  and kids get on.  That's right, man.  We got wine coolers.  Come on.  It's probably a filth bag bus.  It probably has cuffs.  Spiked alcohol.  Roofies.  I know Brian  gets done with his act.  Everybody.  People of all ages.  Races.  Sexual orientation.  Leaving the show  with smiles on their faces  because Brian  was so funny.  And then Brian  gets back in the bus  and just like,  all right,  where are the bitches?  Where are the bitches?  I want to torture 
[04:43:00]  some bitches.  Well, show's over  at that point.  That was Brian time.  Brian time.  See, in his bedroom,  he's got condoms  and a mallet.  Where's the hardware store?  I need more duct tape.  I'll figure out  the mallet part.  In case she gets lippy.  Yeah, you're pro-care.  Where can I get chloroform  in Cleveland?  I need a hanky  and some staples. 
[04:43:30]  What?  I love racing.  Yeah, well,  some people think,  you know,  you can't possibly  be like you are  on stage  all the time.  Yeah.  That would be hard.  Even though there has been  a noticeable  change,  which on anyone else  you wouldn't even notice,  but with you,  I'd almost call it bitter.  This bitterness on stage.  Your act's a little more angry.  Yeah, well,  you know,  I like to play around  with different things  up there,  you know what I mean? 
[04:44:00]  I don't want to just be  the doofus all the time.  You'll talk about  certain people,  like,  I love when you talk about  going to the  butterfly  pavilion.  pavilion.  And I believe  in your act  you're a little mean  to the person  that runs  the butterfly pavilion.  I think that's mean-spirited.  Wait,  what's coming from you?  What's that all about?  Well,  my attitude is  hell with him.  Yeah.  And his butterflies.  And his stupid butterflies.  Well,  they ask you, 
[04:44:30]  you know,  when you walk in,  you walk in with your kids  and you're in,  like,  happy family mode  and the guy's like,  you know,  if you have any  butterfly questions,  I'll be happy to answer them  and you got your kids  so they're expecting  you to ask questions  so you got to brainstorm  and it ain't fun.  The guy's be hovering  around behind you  and you're like,  um,  does this one like to eat?  He does.  Okay.  Do you ever take a break? 
[04:45:00]  No,  you don't.  Okay.  I was thinking,  though,  could there be  a better job  than working  in a butterfly pavilion  you know?  What could possibly  go awry?  So how was work there?  Don't even get me started.  I've had enough to hear  with those butterflies.  I had this yellow one  landing lightly  on flowers  and this purple one  fluttering  around  and around  like I don't know  what he's up to. 
[04:45:30]  I can't take the politics.  Hey,  we got a question  before we go to break.  We're late for a break  but Chuck's  standing by here  from Westchester.  We're talking to  Brian Regan.  What do you got,  Chuck?  Hey,  what's up,  fellas?  Regan,  I love you.  Thanks,  man.  I just wanted to know  if you remember  the most uncomfortable  thing I've ever heard  was you,  Joey Ramone,  and the two Dominics  tries.  Yeah,  I remember that.  Yeah,  that was wild. 
[04:46:00]  Was that your most  uncomfortable moment  on the O.P.  and Anthony show?  There have been a few.  There have been a few.  There have been a few.  There have been a few.  There have been a few.  There have been a few.  That was up there.  That was in the top 20.  Brian's been there  for some weird stuff, man.  That was one of the top 20  uncomfortable moments  on the ONA show.  That's why I think  there's something  in that brain of his  because I'm like,  there's no way  he's ever going to come back  on our show  and he's been back  time and time again.  Ah, man.  I love being on this show, man.  I appreciate you guys 
[04:46:30]  having me.  It's the worst.  It's the worst.  It's the worst.  I will be in Anthony.  Brian Regan in studio.  Yep.  Great.  And Brian's taping  David Letterman.  And then we had to  kind of like brag to Brian  like, you know,  we were on Letterman 2 once.  That's really cool, man.  Brian's doing his  19th appearance,  by the way.  19th appearance.  We got our one and done.  Yeah.  So between you guys,  when you went out,  who got to sit closer  to the desk?  Or did you even,  did you play in it?  Oh, it's a big  controversy with that one.  Was it like musical chairs? 
[04:47:00]  Yes.  First guy there?  It was a foot race  from the wings  into the chair.  Like a starter's pistol.  He just hauled out.  Well, Letterman's  very intimidating,  so I was very happy  to not have to sit  right next to Letterman.  See, you got to go  with the camera, too.  As you're looking  at the TV,  it's got to look like  Opie and Anthony.  See, if Anthony  is sitting there,  so then Opie  sits on the couch part  and Anthony,  I got the chair 
[04:47:30]  next to there  because it just  worked out that way.  And apparently,  I didn't shut up.  Well, I, uh,  I just kept talking  and talking and talking.  Anthony gets a little  chatty at times.  He gets a little chatty.  When Anthony gets nervous,  he gets a little chatty.  He gets a little chatty.  He's kind of a,  he's a fanboy, too,  because we get some  of the guys from Lost on  and Anthony gets chatty  and forgets that he's  doing a radio show  with other people.  I like the show a lot.  So I get a little chatty.  And, and I, I figured  if you're, if you're on, uh, Dave,  you're on Letterman  or Leno, whichever one, 
[04:48:00]  uh, you want to,  you want to keep talking.  You know, you want to,  you want to keep  the conversation rolling.  Well, you don't want  dead spots.  Well, they don't mind  dead spots  because that means  they get to talk.  They have commercials  they need to do,  I think, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I talk right through  those, too,  to keep the energy up.  They just kind of fade out.  Yeah, yeah,  and I'm still talking.  And they come back  and you're still  in the middle of your...  I'm just talking, yeah.  I like when they come back 
[04:48:30]  and you're talking to Dave  and then you go,  and he goes,  oh, we're back,  and I kind of,  ha, ha, chuckle  like we were talking.  Meanwhile, he was still like,  could you shut up  for a second?  We're catching Brian  up on everything.  I, uh,  I was telling Brian  I got engaged.  Yeah.  He's going to me.  Congratulations.  Congratulations.  And then looks at Anthony  and then sorry  for what you're going through.  How weird it is,  you know,  two guys sitting  right next to each other  and one,  yay, fantastic,  and you, wow.  Gee. 
[04:49:00]  Gee, uh.  But I bet you're happy  for Opie.  Oh, yeah.  I think you're...  I am.  Are you happy for me?  I never asked you officially.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm just not  into the institution.  That is marriage.  Anthony doesn't want  to be married,  doesn't want to have kids.  I absolutely am happy  and wish you all the best.  Look at Brian.  He's happily married.  He's got a few kids,  two, I believe.  Two.  Two kids.  He's never home.  He's never home.  I was on stage one time  and there was a guy  sitting up front 
[04:49:30]  and I don't know how  I got talking to him  and I said,  do you have kids?  And he goes, yeah.  And I said, how many?  He goes,  five or six.  What kind of answer is that?  How can you have  five or six kids?  I got like five or six kids.  Absolutely.  I'm going to round it off  by six, five, whatever.  You know, somewhere in there.  Like five or six kids.  That would be like  something I would think  you would know.  Like you would nail that. 
[04:50:00]  Yeah.  That's one of those things  you should absolutely  know exactly.  Absolutely know.  You know,  you might not know,  you know,  how many,  I don't know,  something else  you might have.  Yeah, something else.  This isn't a bit,  obviously.  Because if it was a bit,  I would have a word  instead of the  something else part.  Yeah, not well honed.  You really tricked us.  How many things.  Brian really tricked us there.  I really thought  he was just hanging  into a bit.  It was just knowledge. 
[04:50:30]  It was just  banter.  A thing that happened.  Yeah.  Let's say hi  to Sean in Jersey.  Sean, what's going on?  Sean?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Dude, Brian,  you are crazy.  I've seen you  for the last,  I don't even know  how many years,  like on Comedy Central.  Yeah, dude.  All right.  Thank you.  You make me die laughing  every time.  I appreciate that.  Keep it up.  And with the beauty  of Brian Regan, too, 
[04:51:00]  I've seen Brian  probably a dozen times easily  and every time  just about,  I don't know,  75% of the act  easily is different.  Easily.  Always coming up  with new stuff.  I have a bad memory.  I can't remember  anything from night to night.  That was a very nice compliment,  but it's like weird  and calm.  Only in comedy  can somebody call you crazy  and it's like,  it makes you feel good.  It's like no other field.  Man,  you are like,  you're nuts.  You're like completely  out of your mind. 
[04:51:30]  Well, thank you.  I do surgery over at the,  you're like,  you're like,  like a crazy lunatic surgeon.  You're like nuts.  Wow,  I appreciate that.  And then the other  25%  is stuff that people  want to hear so badly  that they shout it out.  Yeah.  I don't want that.  They do show up for it though.  I go out front  before the shows  and I hand out  slips of paper. 
[04:52:00]  You yell this.  You yell this one out.  You yell this  after he yells that  because this one  segues from the other one.  Now look,  now look,  I'm really gonna,  I'm probably gonna  treat you a little harsh.  I'm gonna yell at you  and you may even  be thrown out,  but it's for the greater  good of Brian Regan.  It's for the good  of the whole show.  You see my glasses  and how cool I look,  right?  Well.  How old's your oldest?  Just turned nine.  Wow.  Does he realize 
[04:52:30]  how funny his dad is?  You know,  it's weird  because I never,  I never like  push what I do  on my kids,  you know?  But, you know,  he knows I'm a comedian,  but now he's starting  to get more curious  about it  and he'll ask me  like when I'm  putting him to bed,  you know,  if I'll do like a bit  from my act or something.  Man,  talk about nervous.  I swear to God,  I'm more nervous  doing a bit  for my son  because it's like  I don't care if, 
[04:53:00]  you know,  a thousand people  like don't like a joke,  but if my boy  doesn't like it,  you know?  Yeah.  And he's like,  you know,  so I'll like do a little bit  and my heart's pounding,  you know,  and he'll go,  oh,  that's funny,  daddy.  Oh,  thank God.  Instead of just going,  boo!  Boo!  Yeah.  You suck!  Get out of my bedroom!  It's just heckling.  You bore me,  father.  He rolls over,  you hack.  Right.  Oh, God.  Bring on the neck!  That would be  the harshest thing  ever. 
[04:53:30]  Oh.  If your kid called you a hack.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  That's going to be  like a nightmare  I'm going to have  one night.  Great joke,  dad,  in 1988.  What,  is there a brick wall  behind you?  All right,  easy,  you're nine,  how do you know this?  Yeah,  right.  His iPod's full of  other comedians.  Rick Moss' God  is his website.  He Googles  anybody but my dad.  Hey,  mom,  bring on the next guy!  Let's say hi to  Kristen in Boston  listening on BCN.  Kristen,  what's up? 
[04:54:00]  Hey,  guys.  Wow,  I didn't expect  to be so nervous.  Ooh.  Oh.  I wanted to say  hey to all of you guys,  but my kids  totally love Brian Regan.  We went and saw him  last summer  and he's hysterical.  Thank you.  We walk around the house,  everybody makes jokes  about you all the time.  We're always saying,  like,  you know,  I'm not about you,  but,  you know.  No,  I took it  an okay way.  Thank you.  That's very,  very nice of you  and your family.  Thank your family. 
[04:54:30]  I will.  I'll thank my whole family.  All right.  And Jimmy,  too.  We love Jimmy,  too.  Thank you,  madam.  I hope the kids  don't listen to Jimmy.  No,  my kids do not  listen to Jimmy.  Ooh.  But they would love him  if they did.  But no,  thanks to you  and your dumb children.  That was Norton.  Oh,  Kristen Cleveland,  what's up,  Chris?  What's going on,  guys?  Hey,  Chris.  Hope and Jimmy,  love you guys.  Thanks,  Chris. 
[04:55:00]  He's not as nervous  as the last call.  No,  he's on silent.  He's cool.  I'm doing all right.  Hey,  Brian,  a quick question.  You got your new eye glasses.  How was the trip  to the eye doctor?  That's a little long.  That's a six-minute answer  you're looking for.  How about something quick?  I'll answer it this way.  It was good.  Right.  Brian,  do you have a quick one,  maybe?  Well,  the test,  where they do the...  Not even on being 
[04:55:30]  at the eye doctor.  You don't have to be polite  to that guy.  Screw him.  Why not?  He's a good man,  you know?  He's a good man.  Probably chopping up  a hooker right now.  I just want to listen  to Brian.  Can I tell from  a 30-second question?  Yeah,  it could be the worst guy.  I can tell he's a good man  with some...  Yeah,  really,  Brian.  He's a man of character.  Let's look at his resume  first before you decide that.  He could be the worst guy ever.  Maybe he's a serial killer.  The charity work  that that man does.  Maybe that's the only way  he could get it, 
[04:56:00]  you know,  get,  you know what,  for,  whatever.  I can't say it over here.  I see the visuals,  though.  Yeah,  they were nice,  right?  Yeah,  good.  He's a good guy.  Yeah.  The,  well,  there's no smooth way  to get into it,  so I won't even try.  Yeah.  Well,  the test where they want you  to tell if the one point  is over the other point,  you know,  where you go in there  and it's like,  tell me the exact moment  point A 
[04:56:30]  is directly over point B.  and you're like,  oh,  oh,  oh,  now,  no,  no,  now,  now,  then.  I don't know.  I don't know when it happened.  I'm worried if I'm off  by an eighth of a second,  I'll get these big giant  Hubble coming attraction glasses.  Boy,  you must have messed up  the A-B test,  did I ever?  Hence the corrective spectacles.  look at Brian with, 
[04:57:00]  oh,  yeah,  this is a good idea.  Dan in Boston,  what's up,  Dan?  Hey,  Brian Regan  and I keep getting calls  about kids liking them,  maybe you should open  for Hannah Montana.  Hey,  that's a hard ticket  to get,  man.  I wouldn't mock that,  man.  She's going to be a billionaire  in the next year or two.  That's exactly why  you should mock her,  because we're jealous  and we hate her.  It's kind of odd, too.  Huh?  It's kind of odd, too. 
[04:57:30]  Yeah.  Hey,  we're not allowed  to think that.  She's too young  to be thinking that kind of thing.  She doesn't look 15,  like she's kind of  a bigger girl.  She looks like she's  like 15 and a half, man.  Yeah,  at least.  That's what I was saying.  She's like 15 and a half.  Oh,  were you at FH Riley's  this Saturday night?  Jesus.

[04:58:00]  Tom,  what's going on?  Hey,  how you guys doing?  Hey.  Hey,  Brian,  I saw you over  at Westbury.  You did this joke  about having the name  of each book  on each page.

Trying to learn  how to read more better.  Trying to learn  how to read more better.  Because,  you know,  reading has a good 
[04:58:30]  reputation.  And,  but I don't get  when you're reading  a book  why they have to put  the title  of the book  on the top  of every single page.  I don't,  I don't get that.  Is there,  anybody ever like  reading a book  and then halfway  through going,  what the hell  am I reading?  Oh,  it's right there  at the top.  Okay.  Well,  I forget again.  Whoa,  it's right there.  Woo,  that is handy.  That's good.  That's good.  I didn't want to have  to go all the way  back to the cover. 
[04:59:00]  Why?  Why when you're  reading a book,  you know,  I mean,  when you go to  the movies,  they don't put  the title  on the top  of the screen.  Well,  oh,  okay.  Hey,  planet of the apes.  Okay.  I was seeing  all these apes  and I'm thinking,  what is going on?  It's a planet  of them.  Okay.  If the whole planet  is of them,  that explains  these apes.
