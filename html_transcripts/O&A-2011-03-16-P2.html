<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show ran significantly longer than usual due to a lengthy call from Ian Halperin and his "goddesses."  Following the main show, Sam Roberts hosted an After Opie and Anthony Live segment.  This segment began with discussion of the show's overrun,  mentioning the frantic efforts of Roland, the Ron and Fez intern, to secure guests for the next broadcast.  The death of rapper Nate Dogg was also noted.  In response, Sam played a previously unreleased rap by frequent guest Bob Kelly, known for his weatherman persona and often subpar rapping abilities.  This freestyle rap was highly explicit and offensive, containing homophobic and misogynistic slurs, vulgar descriptions, and crude rhymes.  The lyrics included boasts about Kelly's comedic appearances, sexually graphic accounts of encounters, and disparaging remarks about Opie and Anthony themselves.  Sam Roberts and the unseen hosts reacted to the rap with a mixture of shock, amusement, and disbelief at its explicit and nonsensical nature.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XR.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  I'm Sam Roberts, as that production piece just told you.  And Opie and Anthony, I mean, I can't believe that they stayed as long as they did.  They haven't been this late, probably since October,  and all because of Ian Halperin and his goddesses. 
[00:00:30]  Obviously, that was important enough to keep going with.  I mean, the show ended with quite a bang.  A celebrity phoner like Ian Halperin and those goddesses.  I don't see how you could do much better.  But this is After Opie and Anthony Live,  where we keep the channel live for a little while  until Ron and Fez come on.  I'm here.  The Ron and Fez intern is in here setting up the studio.  You know, Roland was hilarious to watch  because as the show ended, 
[00:01:00]  Roland was just pitching his heart out,  trying to get Opie and or Anthony to say yes  to one of his guests,  and it just wasn't going down.  E-Rock is here.  E-Rock, were you in here when Roland was trying to pitch that guest?  I was in there, plus outside in the hallway where he continued.  Did he get anywhere?  Um, I think he may have gotten one of them to say yes.  He was basically...  But the other one was a blatant no.  Down on his knees, kissing feet.  He said he needs to get somebody in here.  I don't know why he doesn't rest on his laurels 
[00:01:30]  and realize, look, I just booked His Highness Hollywood,  Sir Ian Halperin.  I can rest easy for a little while.  We've had our share of celebrities on this show.  But the one celebrity that Roland is definitely not going to get,  we mentioned him earlier in the program,  and that, of course, is Nate Dogg.  Nate Dogg passed away, I think, last night.  I started getting tweets this morning when I woke up around,  I don't know, some ungodly hour, 3.30,  that Nate Dogg had passed away. 
[00:02:00]  He was an R&B and rap legend.  But we here on the Opie and Anthony show  have our own history of hip-hop.  A lot of rappers have come and gone from our studio.  We never got to have Nate Dogg in, unfortunately.  I'm sure we would have.  I mean, that's not a hard sell or anything.  But we've had guys like 50 Cent in.  I mean, hip-hop pioneer Russell Simmons was in here.  But in honor of Nate Dogg,  I think it's only fitting that we play today, 
[00:02:30]  for all of you at home,  probably the most influential rapper we've had in studio,  without a doubt,  the most popular rapper we've had in studio.  And as a matter of fact,  I believe this bit is the debut,  the first time this rapper rapped on the radio for us.  Yes, this is the first time we figured out  he actually has skills.  It's an amazing thing.  Ladies and gentlemen,  right here on After Opie and Anthony Live,  it's Mr. Bob Kelly. 
[00:03:00]  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Awful rapping weatherman, Dan.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  This has been sitting around for a while.  Yeah, it's just something I saw earlier in the week,  and I know how we all love the weathermen with a gimmick.  Yeah.  Wacky weathermen are the best, aren't they?  Just another example.  Let's take a listen to this.  A shout-out to Southeast Texas weatherman Nick Cossier  and his super dope forecast.  It is 8-0-4, everybody.  Oh, yes, the rapping weatherman is back doing what I does best, 
[00:03:30]  because I'm a weatherman.  I got my weather map,  so if you have a weather question,  go ahead and ask.  What's today's forecast?  Will it be nice?  Um, yeah, Mike, it'll be all right.  The rhyming genius has been making the morning broadcast better  since last summer  and says he raps on a quarterly basis  or whenever he gets inspired.  Well, here's hoping the lyrical wizard does it more often.  It'll be partly cloudy,  but one thing is clear.  Fox 4, good day, kicks derriere. 
[00:04:00]  One is for the money.  Two is for the show.  Three is for the frizz factor.  Today, it's terrible.  And four is for Fox.  Five is for watch.  Our show, five days a week from 6 through 8 o'clock.  Because 9 is the time that good day ends  and the last number's for Diane because she is a 10.  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box.  Exactly.  They haven't rapped that way in 20...  That isn't even old school anymore. 
[00:04:30]  ...five years.  Easy.  Just freestyling?  That's not even...  That's horrible.  That's like one hair above...  Well, my name is...  ...and I'm here to say.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  My name is Bobby Kelly, and I'm on the mic.  I'm hanging out with my friends.  They don't like dykes.  He had a dream of a fat chick in heels.  And all of a sudden, he starts to appeal to the chicks on the radio  that don't like to be hoes.  And then he took his cock and stuck it in snow. 
[00:05:00]  And I'm going to Poughkeepsie this weekend,  and I'm not going to bring my dearest friend, Opie Hughes.  Greg, you may say, but that's what you want to do back in the day  because now we're matching the hatch.  We're kitching the kitch.  And all of a sudden, we're fucking the bitch in the hotel room, nigga.  What's up?  It makes me yearn for crazed from Ron and Fezz's show.  Fucking crazed.  Holy mother of God.  We did a lot of material on the show today. 
[00:05:30]  I want to continue with this.  Those are some fat rhymes, yeah.  What did we do on the show today?  James Cagney, Grapefruit, Bigfoot guy.  Fucking great.  What else are we talking about?  Stratosphere.  The dreams.  Well, you did the dream one.  I'm trying to do something different.  Anthony and his fucking flute.  Oh, I did a little musical number.  Chester the dog.  Chester the dog with the dead dog.  What else?  What else?  That's some good material.  Oh, my God.  You ready?  Yeah.  All right, go.  Ready?  I need a beat, though. 
[00:06:00]  I'll give my own beat.  Ready?  I'm not a beatbox.  I'm hanging on the show with my friend Ant and Greg.  We all of a sudden start to eat eggs.  We put them down and talk into the mic because, you know, we don't like the fuck.  The dykes, we like pussy, and it's got to be juicy.  We're going over to the place. 
[00:06:30]  Don't laugh at me, Anthony, while I'm on the mic.  You might not know how to fuck a dyke.  I'll say it twice.  You don't give a shit.  Fuck you.  You know, and that dog you had is a fucking mutt, and I would have kicked it in the fucking gut.  Hope he had the right moves because his steak was on the floor and his potatoes weren't there no more.  So he killed that motherfucker, rough, rough, rough.  But you know what?  It wasn't that guff.  You look it up in the dictionary if you don't know what I mean because I don't have time to show you the team of the A, the Rampage Jackson. 
[00:07:00]  You know I'm a fraction of what I should have been a long time ago, but I'll keep rapping.  You don't hate this.  You don't even know.  I'll throw it in right in the middle.  I'm so fucking wow.  I eat Skittles.  I'll spiff it up.  I'll make it jacked, and then I'll look back on the guy with the heart attack that saw Sasquatch in the woods, and you know all of a sudden he has the word coulds in his fucking mouth because he had a gun made of a stick.  All of a sudden, you had to pick. 
[00:07:30]  Did you know him?  Did you know her?  Or did you like it?  But you don't know because you drink water.  Yeah!  I'm not done.  Fuck that.  We're going to go back.  But that's supposed to be some kind of sick joke.  And I'll throw the joke in.  But you know I'm no yoke like the inside of an egg on the outside.  Which is it?  But you know.  What have we got here?  Fucking comedian.  I do.  I tell jokes on the weekends at Bananas.  Poughkeepsie.  I don't have shit that rhymes with Poughkeepsie except come see me.  Oh. 
[00:08:00]  I mean, you can see how a white girl can fall for him.  White girls like me.  Black girls like me.  Girls adore me.  Even the ones that even saw me know I even rhyme with a fucking show.  Why?  I don't know.  I'll steal a fucking rap from a hoe.  I don't give a shit.  I'll move on.  Push another button.  I'll flow with it.  You don't even got no fucking show without it.  Yo, I'm Bob Kelly.  I'm a rapping genius.  Hey, where are the white women at?  They're around the corner.  After the show, we're going to go see them.  Whoa. 
[00:08:30]  Da, ha, ha, ha.  Da, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah.  Da, ha, ha, ha.  Skup, bump, dat, boo, doom, bah.  I make it into jazz.  As simple as that.  Opie has a smile that makes you go, wow.  Anthony has hair that makes you go, he.  Anthony has a cock that makes me go, do.  I just mix it up.  Do what, Bobby?  Oh, my God.  What the fuck just popped out there?  Your Lord Jesus, this ain't happening, man.  It's happening. 
[00:09:00]  This can't be happening, man.  This isn't happening.  It's happening.  Okay, faggot, what's next?  I'm not a faggot, but I'll tell you what's next. </pre>
