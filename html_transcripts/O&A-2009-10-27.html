<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a raucous discussion about the upcoming Yankees-Phillies World Series, playfully dubbed the "Turnpike," "Liberty," or "Amtrak Series," heavily mocking the Phillies' train travel.  This segued into a comparison of New York pizza and Philadelphia cheesesteaks, fueled by a caller, Joe from Philly, and further escalating into a profanity-laced debate.  A digitally altered photo of a Phillies player in a skirt, published in a New York newspaper, was discussed, accompanied by homophobic remarks from the hosts. The show featured a sarcastic "Ten Annoying Things About Philadelphia and the Phillies" segment and a "Tale of the Tapes" comparing the two cities, including disparaging comments about the use of Cheez Whiz on cheesesteaks.  A recurring comedic segment with "the Virus" hilariously failed to deliver a joke about the Phillies.  The ESPN suspensions of Bob Greasy (for a taco comment) and Brooke Hundley were discussed, highlighting perceived oversensitivity.

The show then transitioned into vulgar jokes about one host's wife, a story about a cab ride with an Eddie Trunk enthusiast, and a caller, "Psychotic," recounting a story about an intoxicated police sergeant pointing a gun at a haunted house worker.  This led to a debate on sentencing disparities, with a caller, Kevin, mentioning 27 inmates released early in North Carolina due to a legal technicality.  The upcoming appearance of the *Paranormal Activity* cast was mentioned, along with Brock Lesnar's postponed UFC fight.  Another caller, Rhett, shared a story about Brooke Hundley's online photos and her perceived vindictiveness, further fueling discussion about her and Steve Phillips.  The show took a sharp turn into explicit discussions about bestiality, continued criticism of Brooke Hundley's appearance, and skepticism towards the authenticity of various True TV shows and viral videos, including a "Drunkest Guy Ever" video.  The segment concluded with the hosts expressing frustration with their station, comparing themselves unfavorably to the Chunky and Loper show, and expressing jealousy over Chunky's success on 92.3 Now.

The next segment started with mockery of a Detroit DJ who always wore a Yankees hat and a critique of a 92.3 Now commercial featuring Chunky, focusing on his Slurpee jokes and radio style. Chunky's phone segment, where callers described their ex-boyfriends, was discussed and satirized. This led to an interview with Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat from *Paranormal Activity*, focusing on the film's low budget and unexpected success.  The hosts frequently interrupted and joked during the interview, also mocking Chunky's concurrently running segment. The actors discussed their experience and future plans before departing for an appearance on the Today Show.

The subsequent segment began with further discussion about the *Paranormal Activity* cast's low pay, speculating about back-end deals and contrasting it with Sylvester Stallone's *Rocky*. The hosts attempted to contact Kevin Smith for insight. This transitioned into a graphic and explicit discussion about one actress's physical attributes, with Jimmy Norton providing detailed descriptions of oral sex.  They then discussed issues with their Sirius XM guest booking process, listing celebrities who'd declined appearances.  Kevin Smith finally joined the call, explaining movie financing, back-end deals, and his experiences with *Clerks*.  He invited Opie to a screening. The segment ended with continued complaints about Sirius XM's booking process, opinions on hockey shootouts and sports rule changes, John Gosselin's finances, speculation about Amelia Earhart, and more sexually suggestive humor.

The final segment opened with a discussion of an Amelia Earhart movie deemed a "chick flick," followed by a caller, Ray from Long Beach, reporting a fire at JFK airport.  A critical review of Michael Jackson's "This Is It" documentary followed, mocking Elizabeth Taylor's praise.  An email from "Radio Santa" led to a humorous anecdote about one host's mall Santa firing. A phone call about Chaz Bono's transition was played.  The JFK fire report continued, interspersed with air traffic control chatter. A listener's Seinfeld observation about Brooke Hundley's resemblance to a character sparked a lengthy and vulgar discussion about her appearance.  This led to opinions on *Seinfeld*, *Curb Your Enthusiasm*, and their characters' physical attributes.  The show concluded with explicit descriptions and jokes about Chaz Bono's transition and surgeries, culminating in a mention of an upcoming Chaz Bono interview.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Let's rock!  A lot of good mornings coming in on the instant feedback.  Well, good morning to you too.  Guten Morgen!  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show, and the trash-talking has begun.  Yes.  We got a Philly-New York World Series, or a New York-Philly World Series.  They're calling it the Turnpike Series.  Are they?  Or I've heard the Liberty Series. 
[00:00:30]  They're calling it that.  Why the Liberty Series?  I guess because the Statue of Liberty is here, and the Liberty Bell is there.  So I heard the Liberty Series.  How about we just call it the World Series?  Oh my God, don't call it that.  Call it the big game that isn't played with an oval ball.  How about we call it the Amtrak Series?  The Amtrak Series.  The Turnpike Series.  Yeah, you said that one.  Yes.  What else?  The Greyhound Series.  The Greyhound Series.  The Short Flight Series. 
[00:01:00]  Yes.  The Very Short Flight Series.  And I was talking about that, because big news, the Phillies came up here on a train, and  the manager there is looking like a commuter, because he wanted to just fit in.  Yeah.  And it's like, can't they take a plane?  I think it would be more of a pain in the ass to take a plane from Philly to New York.  A little charter or something.  You get one of those little charter planes.  You're up, you're down, you're out, boom.  You got your coffee. 
[00:01:30]  You're playing bass, but you're practicing, dude.  You're up, you're down, boom.  Yeah, boom.  Dude, you got your coffee.  You got your spreadsheets.  You got your rosary bag.  Your rosary bag.  Right.  Dude, you hop on the train.  You relax, dude.  You sleep.  If you doze off, you got your wireless, boom.  Have your cup of coffee.  Your pilots have wired on the computer, boom.  They're fired.  Right.  Dude, yeah, you overshoot the airport.  Well, we nailed that one yesterday, too. 
[00:02:00]  I know.  We fucking tell everyone the news before the stupid news people tell you.  The day before.  The air traffic controller and the pilot basically told us what that was all about in Minnesota,  and then it comes out four hours later.  That's exactly what happened.  That's what happened.  What happened?  They missed some radio calls.  Oh, okay.  They missed the calls.  They were busy doing their thing, and they missed their radio calls.  No.  They probably heard the show and went, oh, why didn't we think of that?  Yeah, we missed the call.  Wow.  Good one.  Both fired, losing their license. 
[00:02:30]  Fuck.  Why are they really?  That sucks.  Yeah, they said people that are so preoccupied with something that has nothing to do with  their flight of the plane, have no business being in a cockpit on a passenger plane, losing  the light.  That is a biggie.  I think they don't believe them, obviously.  They think they fell asleep.  Well, they said they were on their individual personal laptops, and that's why they missed  everything, which is also a violation.  You're not supposed to be on your personal computer while you're flying.  But that shows how safe flying is, so Godspeed to everyone trying to the airport this morning. 
[00:03:00]  Flight made it perfectly.  Who gives a shit?  It's so boring that they're on their personal laptops instead of landing the plane.  I guess you've got to fire them.  If you miss the fucking...  If you miss it by 150 miles, I think some people have to be fired.  I'd like to be able to do that to the stupid fucking cab drivers and the black car drivers  that miss a turn or take the wrong way, and you're like, no, you take this west side  hub.  No, you idiot. 
[00:03:30]  Right.  It's like, oh, he overshot my destination.  Fired.  Fired.  Well, let's get back to the Phillies, though.  So they take the Amtrak up here.  If they took a flight, I think it's one of those flights that's so short that they actually  have to reroute it all the way to Maine.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  You can't get up to altitude.  No, you can't get up to altitude and land between here and Philly.  That's ridiculous.  Do they even have flights from here to Philly?  I'm not talking about the small planes.  I'm talking about a basic fucking jet that most of us take.  I don't think anything you can, I'm sure they do. 
[00:04:00]  I've done the.  You can fit a whole ball team in and everybody else.  I've done the Boston to New York flight.  That one's just completely ridiculous.  Yeah.  Why bother?  It's a little roller coaster.  You go, chick, chick, chick, chick, chick, chick.  It's unbelievable.  Right.  Let's say hi to Joe in Philly.  Hello, Joe.  Yeah, I just want you guys to remember that the Phillies came into the Bronx at the beginning  of this year and took two out of three.  So fuck you, Kumia.  You stone prick. 
[00:04:30]  Stone down.  First of all, I'm not stoned.  Secondly, boy, look how it worked out for Boston also, who kicked the Yankees' ass all season  long.  And then, oopsie, things changed quickly, didn't it?  Excuse me.  You're talking to nobody.  I don't care.  He's still listening.  No, he's not.  Fucking scumbag.  No, he's not.  Shut up.  No, he's not.  Go shit out last night's cheesesteak.  I hope it hurts.  Ugh, all runny.  You've never had a cheesesteak, have you?  Big runny cheesesteak shit.  It's so awful that the meat goes down one side of your leg and the cheese goes down the 
[00:05:00]  other.  You know what?  You guys are all wrong.  Cheesesteaks are one of the greatest treats of all time.  I will not deny it.  What did Sam's father call his treats?  Some of the greatest treats.  Some of the greatest treats of all time.  Yes.  Yeah.  Well, cheesesteaks are right up there.  Yeah.  New York doesn't have that type of delicious little treat.  We have the ultimate deliciousness right on the sidewalk.  You could walk down and smell the wonderful...  A wiener dog? 
[00:05:30]  A wiener.  You could smell the wonderful gyros being made.  Pretzels.  Pretzels.  Those sausage and peppers.  There's plenty of variety.  You don't have to go, what am I getting tonight?  Nothing.  We only have cheesesteaks here.  It's Philly.  It doesn't compare to a nice cheesesteak, my friend.  What, are you going to get that tiny, like, thin-sliced pizza?  Don't you want some fucking heaviness to your pizza?  Wait, wait, wait.  You can't tell me New York...  New York pizza? 
[00:06:00]  Pizza.  Wait, Philly pizza is better than New York pizza?  I'm not saying Philly pizza is better.  Holy shit.  I'm comparing the cheesesteak.  I thought you needed to be committed.  No, I'm comparing the cheesesteak to the tiny, little, thin pizza.  Oh, I gotcha.  I'd rather have a cheesesteak every time in that situation.  And we don't need cheesesteak.  We have the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  We have the Natural Museum of History.  Fucking...  Well, the Museum of Natural History.  No, it's the Natural Museum of History.  They changed the name.  Oh, okay.  I missed that.  It's a natural museum.  There's no roof.  Asshole I am.  I enjoy a good Philly steak cheese. 
[00:06:30]  Boo.  Let's go to Tom in Delaware.  Tom!  Morning, boys.  Good morning, Tom.  Let's go.  We got an energy going.  All right, Tom.  All right, yo, that guy was a douchebag.  The whole fact that the Phillies took two out of three was before the whole A-Rod swing.  I think at that point, the Yankees were like 20 out of 40.  Fuck that guy.  I do believe, also, the Yankees dropped eight games to Boston.  Exactly.  They could not fucking win, and then they were just kicking Boston's ass. 
[00:07:00]  So shut it!  So you're saying that Boston deserves to be in the World Series and not the Yankees?  Um, what?  Wait, what did you say?  No.  Did you guys beat Boston or lose to Boston?  No, I was saying, at first, Boston was saying, well, yeah, I'd like to see you beat us because,  you know, you dropped eight games to us and stuff.  It's like, yeah, and then things changed.  Did you own Boston this year?  I don't even know.  Yeah.  What was the record against Boston?  I couldn't tell you the fucking record.  I just know we fucking owned them and owned them when it counted. 
[00:07:30]  Well, the front page of one of the papers here in New York City has, I just tweeted this picture.  It's not going to make Philly fans happy.  Shane Victorino is in a little, a little what?  Almost like a 2-2.  Almost like a cheerleader's bottom.  Yeah.  A little short skirt with the Philly colors.  Why would he dress like that?  He's only going to draw criticism to himself.  Well, this is the newspaper, so it's got to be real.  Oh, no, it's not.  It's actually a photo composite, they call it. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, okay.  If you make a photo composite, then you're allowed to do this.  I gotcha.  It completely changed the news.  Because I'm sure Mr. Victorino never wore this getup in public anyway.  Maybe in his personal time he might have.  Who knows?  And it says, Gotham trembles.  The frillies are coming to town.  The frillies they're calling them.  They're basically saying faggots are headed up the turnpike.  That gay team is coming to play ball with bats in their asses. 
[00:08:30]  The lip wrists will be here to play some baseball.  The picture's on my Twitter, OP Radio.  It's not going to make you Philly fans happy.  I want to see what the Philly paper's saying today, though.  Because you know they're doing the exact same thing.  Yes.  What's the front page of one of the Philly papers look like?  Maybe someone could help us out with that.  It's probably the same picture.  Right.  Doesn't say composite.  But they're saying it in a different way.  They're saying we're coming to fuck your ass, Yankees.  Eat our pussies.  Eat our pussies.  Yeah. 
[00:09:00]  People got to relax.  OP, stop at the Philly love.  We know you want to keep getting laid, but stop.  You have the sincerity of Sam.  I'm a Mets fan.  I'm in a tough spot right here.  Am I focused on the Phillies a little bit because I got some connections to Phillies?  Sure.  But I couldn't even fucking name half the fucking team.  How old is this fucking Phillies manager?  How's Charlie Manuel?  What is he, 300?  You see him with his little hat like he's commuting?  Yeah, he looks doddering.  He looks lost.  Look at him.  Doddering.  Where am I?  He has no idea.  He's like Jimmy Stewart.  He's all old. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, God, yeah.  Why would you listen to him?  We got to get some pitching out there is what we do.  Get your chin up, guys.  So we're going to win this one.  I say Yanks in four.  Shut up.  Yeah, Yanks in three.  This is going to be a pretty good series.  To me, it's a great series.  Steve, I'll log out.  Steve.  Four 17 to one victories in a row.  You forgot about the eggs.  Yeah, Steve, you just keep going.  The cashews and the fucking peanuts in the city, you fucking mook.  What's that? 
[00:10:00]  You fucking mook.  Roasted almonds and cashews?  I should remember that from a city?  That's true.  Shut your yap.  Wait, does he like those awful cashews they sell on the street corner?  Oh, stop it.  What is it?  What kind of nuts they sell?  They're all men's.  The roasted shit.  What is that roasted shit, Dave?  I don't think it's roasted almonds.  It's mostly peanuts.  No, it's not peanuts.  Help me out.  Roasted almonds.  No, roasted almonds and maybe cashews.  That's what you taste when you... 
[00:10:30]  It's not roasted peanuts, Danny.  I'm telling you.  I would bet money on that.  It's peanuts, cashews, and something else.  Nuts for nuts.  They're delicious.  It's definitely peanuts.  Yeah, it's absolutely peanuts.  Come on.  Help me out here.  I like peanuts.  It's a nut that I hate.  What's the smell that's supposed to make you remind me of almonds as a poison or something?  Oh, yeah.  Cyanide.  Cyanide.  Yeah, that's why I love them.  Because you secretly want to kill yourself?  No, I'm saying that's why I'm hoping that they serve by accident.  Oh, okay.  There you go.  That's a long way to go. 
[00:11:00]  I'm challenging the peanut thing.  Because I walk by these dumb nut guys and I'm very disappointed.  Honey roasted nuts.  Oh, in New York?  Yeah.  Where are they?  Oh, yeah.  Honey roasted peanuts.  Yes.  They are peanuts.  Do they sell Brazil nuts there?  Then I think I'm ordaining an apology, but I don't...  Peanuts, cashews, and almonds.  And then you can get a mixed bag.  All right.  I apologize.  No Brazil nuts?  What's a Brazil nut?  Well, my family used to have another name for them.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Growing up. 
[00:11:30]  Ring or balls.  Hey, pass me those.  Ring or balls.  Brazil nuts.  Apparently what Ronaldo got in trouble for picking up.  If anybody knows soccer, that was a good one.  Yeah.  I didn't think so.  Wow.  Ronaldo is Brazil's biggest soccer star and he had a fracas with a tranny.  Yeah, he did.  It was very embarrassing.  For him.  For me, it wouldn't have been.  The joke is embarrassing for you.  Oh, no.  I didn't recognize it as a joke.  It had none of the makings of a joke.  It had none of the irony or humor of a joke.  It fell into having a boring statement. 
[00:12:00]  There you go.  Let's go to Dan in Ohio.  Dan.  Yeah, what's up, boy?  What's up, Dan?  Charlie Manuel used to be the manager in Cleveland.  And the guy was so fucked up.  He used to have, I know he had skin cancer at one point, but he literally had to manage  a game in the dugout.  He had a colostomy bag.  I can't remember what the hell was actually wrong with him, but I know they had a Sports  Illustrated article about him a few months ago where he actually had to wear a colostomy  bag in the dugout. 
[00:12:30]  Does he still wear it or no?  No, no, no.  I don't know what the problem was.  He's just lazy.  He had to at the time, but no, I'm sure he doesn't wear it anymore.  And he had to wear the uniform like he might go out there and play.  On that day, they should have allowed him to wear a hospital gown with the fucking...  Some of the little looser fittings.  With the logo on.  They probably put a little Philly's logo on the side of the duty bag.  Right.  It's a little purse.  They disguise it so you don't know what it is.  Hey, what's that little pouch hanging on the side that says Philly's? 
[00:13:00]  None of the other players have that.  It's my jaw.  My chewing-a-backy.  You want some?  Going back to the nuts, can we acknowledge that chestnuts suck a dick?  Who the fuck eats chestnuts?  Anybody in this room eat chestnuts?  Around the holidays.  You don't eat fucking chestnuts.  No.  They're dry.  They don't even smell good.  When was the last time you even attempted to eat a chestnut?  Had to be back in the 80s. 
[00:13:30]  They're horrendous.  Let's go to Roger in Cleveland.  Roger.  Roger.  Hey, good morning, gentlemen.  Over.  Hi.  I got to say, I wanted to tell all these New York and Philly faggots to shut their mouths  and they better be thanking Cleveland for their two starting pitchers today.  Oh, I gotcha.  Did the Indians have both of those?  Wait, when did they start playing?  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Shit.  Wednesday.  Weather permitting.  Weather permitting.  What, we got rain coming in or snow?  Could be.  Not rain.  What the fuck?  They're used to it. 
[00:14:00]  Why are we playing baseball in November?  That doesn't make sense.  God damn it, it's November, right?  It started in, I think, late March.  Not even Halloween-y yet.  It's going to be November, though.  That's what I'm getting at.  Eventually.  This World Series ends in November.  That's crazy.  They're going to have to call it the Winter Classic.  Ha ha ha ha.  Boo.  Ha ha ha.  Young captain.  People want to know who I'm rooting for, for real, for sports curse reasons and betting  reasons.  Mm-hmm.  But it's got to be sincere. 
[00:14:30]  We all agree.  You can't just say it.  It is sincere.  I mean, it hurts, because it's a no-win situation for us Mets fans, but I got to go Phillies.  Sorry, Anthony.  But it won't be...  No, I understand as a Mets fan.  I won't be sitting here with a fucking Phillies hat on any time soon, so I'm going to make  that clear.  Like Eastside Dave, who's a traitor, a traitor to the Yankees.  He's a traitor.  He came in with a Phillies hat?  Yes.  He is now completely committed to the Phillies winning.  He is a complete traitor to the Yankees. 
[00:15:00]  Is he a Mets fan?  No, he's been a lifelong Yankees fan.  And he has just given up on the Yankees.  He's going with the Phillies.  And I'm disgusted with him, and I'm not even going to say hi to him in the hallways anymore.  Why is he doing that?  When he comes in.  To be on Ronnie's good side?  No, I believe...  Well, yeah, there is something to do with Ronnie, and...  Is he being outrageous?  Is he being crazy?  He's being a little crazy.  He just... 
[00:15:30]  I think he's a bandwagon jumper, and he thinks that the Phillies are going to do it.  It doesn't make sense if he's a Yankee fan, though.  I think he's upset with the Yankees for some way, shape, or form.  How can you be upset with the Yankees this year?  I don't know.  They did everything perfect.  Oh, no, he's very upset with Girardi.  Why?  Very upset with Girardi, and some of the decisions he made during some of the playoffs.  Very upset.  In the end, he made the right decisions, because they won.  Well, they won, but there were a couple of moves there that could have cost them the game there, Mikey. 
[00:16:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And it caused them the game.  All right, well...  Yeah, he's very...  So he came in with a Phillies hat on, which was the ultimate insult.  And the Yankees want to win this one for George Steinbrenner.  We're actually saying we want to win it for George.  Win it for George.  George, they have a picture of him in the paper, and wowie kazowie.  Has he been out of the...  What is he suffering from, Al?  He's got to be suffering from everything.  He's got a little cane, it looked like.  That sucks.  Yeah, you know, Philadelphia's in the World Series.  He's been yelling, beat the A's. 
[00:16:30]  I mean, his mind is not quite what he used to be.  No.  They're saying his sons did the job, though.  Yeah.  Went out and got the players just like George used to do back in the day, back in the day.  Georgie.  So his two sons are doing very, very well for the family.  Apparently.  Well, Anthony, we continue with the Philly, New York thing.  Ten annoying things about Philadelphia and the Phillies.  Here they go.  Jimmy, you appreciate some good humor, right?  Well, I love a good Phillies joke, Ope.  All right.  Well, here we go. 
[00:17:00]  The top...  Well, they have 11 on the list, even though it's 10 annoying things about Philadelphia and  the Phillies.  Number 11.  Put your laughing hats on.  Oh.  Okay.  Here's a peace offering.  One thing for us to be jealous of.  Rents in Philadelphia are actually reasonable.  Oh, I get it.  10.  The Athletics wanted to get out so badly, they actually preferred Oakland by way of KC. 
[00:17:30]  It's all right.  They preferred Oakland by way of Kansas City.  They went to Kansas City first.  Yeah.  But what does that have to do with New York and...  Well, they're saying that Philly's so shitty that this team preferred Oakland and even  Kansas City on the way to Philly, because Philadelphia Athletics...  No, that's going way back with the humor.  Yeah.  Way back, like the turn of the century stuff, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Stop.  All right.  Nine.  Even a hot band like The Roots has to come to New York to find work.  Oh, okay.  Sure.  Is there a laugh to be had yet?  No. 
[00:18:00]  I'm looking for it.  They're all mildly interesting points, but none that you find funny.  Mildly interesting.  Not worth printing up anywhere.  Not even really worth thinking.  No.  Eight.  Sales tax on newspapers, magazines, and comics.  Seriously?  I guess there's taxes here.  Apparently, but New York's in no position to sling wide about taxes.  No, but it's annoying things about Philadelphia and the Phillies, so they got sales tax on newspapers,  magazines, and comics.  Oh, okay.  I guess.  So the airport.  Number seven.  New York has the Thanksgiving, St. Patrick's, Puerto Rican, Village Halloween, and Mermaid 
[00:18:30]  Parades.  Philadelphia, you have the Mummers Parade.  Enough said.  Didn't they forget the Columbus Day Parade, too?  Yeah, they did, Jimmy.  They certainly did.  They certainly corrected them.  Number six.  The Phillies' biggest celebrity fan spot in the stadium stands, Kelly Ripa.  Really?  And they wrote, really.  But how many fat vaginas have been spotted in the Yankees?  I say none.  And we've all seen her camel tail pics.  I'm trying to make something out of this.  This is sucking the energy right out of the studio, right? 
[00:19:00]  Out of their fucking city.  Five, yeah, Philly has been Franklin, but your most famous citizen of modern times isn't  even a real person.  Sorry to break it to you, but no, Rocky Balboa doesn't exist.  Okay, maybe that's not totally fair.  There are plenty of other famous Philadelphians from recent times.  Bill Cosby, Will Smith, Kevin Bacon, but none of them apparently rates a statue.  This is a horrible, stupid-ass list. 
[00:19:30]  Just report the news, you assholes.  Oh, my God.  They sit there and try to be funny.  Some funny lines.  No.  This next one coming up is actually funny.  When I said turn of the century, you fucking asshole, when they were the Philadelphia Athletics,  when was that?  1900s.  Thank you.  Go fuck yourself.  That's why I said that.  Yes, across the river in New Jersey, we have Newark, but Philly, you have Camden. 
[00:20:00]  At least Newark has an airport.  Yeah, I get it.  Dude, we make it to number one.  Ten annoying things about Philadelphia and the Phillies.  You like that one, Jimmy?  Three, seems Philly fans aren't enthusiastic enough about the inherent beauty, suspense,  and thrills of the game of baseball that they need the antics of an idiotic furry monster  of a mascot, the Philly fanatic, and fireworks after every home run to get them riled up. 
[00:20:30]  Mascots are for high school, and fireworks are for the 4th of July.  New Yorkers don't need that nonsense to get excited.  Holy shit, is that wordy.  What?  That's wordy.  This is good.  Number two, the city of Brotherly Love's most famous culinary delight, ah, the Philly cheesesteak,  ant, is made with Cheez Whiz, not real cheese.  That's a lie, by the way.  Goop from a bottle or jar is not cheese. 
[00:21:00]  I'm not saying it doesn't taste good, but you may as well call it a Philly goop steak.  Oh, I get it.  Instead of cheesesteak.  And number one, just because it'll be very painful, Philadelphia has been called New York's  sixth borough.  Indeed, Amtrak will get you to Midtown Manhattan faster than the commute from Staten Island,  yet folks would still rather live on Staten Island.  Yeah, well.  Ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba-da. 
[00:21:30]  How horrible is that?  That was terrible.  I enjoyed it.  Tale of the Tapes, we could do.  We could do Tale of the Tapes.  That was awful.  Huh?  I'm sure that's the same, like, awfulness.  Why don't you, you guys, I'm going to pass out.  I'm going to pass out a Tale of the Tapes to Anthony.  Oh, goody.  Cool me that.  Goody.  There you go.  And Jimmy.  I probably have.  What page is it?  Uh, you got to go to the Daily News.  Okay.  For your Tale of the Tapes.  So you have what?  Page five.  There's two Tale of the Tapes in the paper today. 
[00:22:00]  Now this is, of course, things that Philly has and things that New York has.  All right.  And, uh, you tell me which is better.  I'm going to try.  I'm going to try.  Go ahead.  Uh, as far as records go, Philly has the first team to chalk up 10,000 losses, including 23  in a row in 1961.  And, uh, New York, of course, only team to win 26 world championships.  There you go.  I don't have that one.  Mascot?  Of course, Philly. 
[00:22:30]  Come on.  The Philly Fanatic.  By the way, whose uniform is the little Fanatic suit.  It stinks.  Yeah, we smelled it.  He was in the studio at YSP when we were over there in the, uh, olden days.  And, uh, it smelled like he shit and pissed in it.  And then was walking around blowing that stupid party favor out of his mouth.  And mascot that we have?  Kate Hudson.  I get it.  She's at every game.  Is she?  Yeah. 
[00:23:00]  She's taking the old, uh, A-Rod rod.  You think her vagina smells as bad as the Philly Fanatic suit?  No.  It couldn't.  Fresh as a daisy.  She's had a lot of, uh, yeah, a lot of rockstar talk.  She's had a lot of, uh, uh, a lot of, uh, don't upset anybody.  She's getting Jeter to hit.  I don't give a shit.  Jeter.  Oh, Jeter.  Because I was just looking at Derek Jeter as best.  Oh, this is horrible.  All right, go ahead.  Best sandwich, cheesesteak for Philly, for New York, Derek Jeter and a couple of models. 
[00:23:30]  I get it.  Imagine that sandwich.  Boo!  They did not write that in a newspaper.  Break out the Valtrex.  And, of course, uh, best known quote, Yo Adrian for Philly.  In New York, give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.  That's not our most famous fucking quote.  I'd rather take the Yo Adrian.  Right.  Keep the fucking huddled masses. 
[00:24:00]  Get them out of here.  No, that's what built this country.  It's true.  You gotta understand that.  Fuck that noise.  You gotta understand that.  Built it, and now it's tearing it apart.  A Big Night Out, I guess the road company of cats at the Walnut Street Theater, again.  That's what Philly's got.  And what do we have?  Hamlet on Broadway.  Might have heard of The Great White Way, Broadway.  Hot, hot cuisine. 
[00:24:30]  What the fuck word is that?  H-A-U-T-E.  I don't know that one.  Hot, hot.  I'm sure it's like, you know.  H-A-U-T-E is kind of snotty, isn't it?  Top of the line, yeah.  I just didn't know how to pronounce it.  H-A-U-T-E.  I don't think I've ever used that word.  H-A-U-T-E.  I can't pronounce it, actually.  H-A-U-T-E.  H-A-U-T-E.  H-A-U-T-E.  A scrapple and a soft pretzel is Philly.  Scrapple.  And, of course, New York, foie gras.  Foie gras at the Four Seasons. 
[00:25:00]  No one fucking eats that.  No.  What is it?  Isn't that like bone marrow?  It's goose liver.  It's goose shit, basically.  Big goose liver.  A lot of people.  It's not goose liver.  It's the stuff that builds up in the liver.  No, it's goose liver.  They take the whole liver and they slice it.  Are you sure?  Oh, yeah.  Foie gras.  I heard it's the shit that collects in the liver and then they squeeze it out like toothpaste.  No.  They take the liver out because geese have pretty big livers and they feed them and give them  things to make their liver real swollen.  Yeah, that's true. 
[00:25:30]  Like booze.  Yeah.  I wouldn't eat that.  Yeah.  And then you chop it up and it's goose though.  Would you eat foie gras?  Goose liver is...  Silly.  Someone says goose liver is pate.  Isn't it foie gras too?  What is foie gras?  Like they call it...  Look up foie gras.  F-O-I-E.  I don't eat this shit.  G-R-O-I-S or G-R-A-S?  Foie gras.  I don't know.  Goose liver is pate.  I've had a little of that on a cracker.  It's not bad. 
[00:26:00]  It's F-O-I-E.  F-O-I-E.  I wouldn't search it out though.  Foie gras.  Grass.  G-R-A-S.  There we go.  Foie gras.  What is it made of, Daniel?  Foie gras.  It's a food product made of the liver of a duck or goose that has been specifically fattened.  Yeah, okay.  Fattening is typically achieved through force feeding.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Force feeding.  Yeah, they put a funnel down the little fucker's bill.  Humans are a bunch of jerks.  Just for that fucking shitty food.  We're a bunch of jerks. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  We force feed goose so we can eat their liver.  We force feed this animal so we can kill it and fucking eat its pasty liver?  Are we a bunch of jerks?  Just assholes.  High society stinks of food.  We deserve whatever we get disease wise.  We deserve the swine flu.  We deserve AIDS.  We really are shit.  We deserve the goose flu.  I'm sure they're fucking trying to figure that one out for us.  And what is the other shit?  Yeah, you're right.  Rich people eat that shit.  It's high society shit.  Snotty hot fucker.  I love when they fucking grab their chest and fall face first into the fucking pool. 
[00:27:00]  Turns out it was a heart attack.  Good.  Whatever it was.  We said that yesterday too.  Oops.  The guy that made seven billion on the Madoff scam.  Foie gras.  If I ever see somebody eating that, I'll drill my fist into their face unless they're a man.  Then I won't.  What's pate?  Foie gras.  She's our ugly old lady that we know.  Stalk hair pate.  Stalk pate, motherfucker.  Foie gras is a type of pate.  Oh.  Oh.  Okay.  So pate is the, I guess the base or something. 
[00:27:30]  And it can be made of some shit.  They get a force feed of fucking goose?  Yeah, they do.  They shove shit down its throat.  What are they doing on starvation diets anyway?  What are they doing making political protests?  Those goddamn geese?  Let's see.  Ballpark's old stadium left had a jail cell for idiot fans for Philly.  That's happening everywhere though now.  And New York, new stadium has a steakhouse and a lounge for the greatest fans on earth.  Wait, you're still reading Tell of the Tape? 
[00:28:00]  Of course.  All right.  Here's the last one.  I didn't realize that.  Famous on-field moments.  Snarling police dogs keep fans at bay after the 1980 World Series.  And Lou Gehrig's, I'm the luckiest man on the face of the earth speech.  That's a bit skewed.  Really?  Just a tad.  Why don't you go to YouTube and see Wade Boggs on a horse backwards or when they won in the 
[00:28:30]  70s and the fans ran on the field and just completely destroyed the place.  Yay!  Really?  That was skewed.  Lou Gehrig.  Yeah, that was a little one-sided.  Of course it's going to skew.  One-sided.  By the way, I know they use fucking Cheez Whiz on cheesesteaks, but they also, some places,  you know, jazz it up a little bit with some better cheeses.  They don't use Cheez Whiz.  Like, that isn't a staple, is it?  That isn't like you got to use Cheez Whiz for it to be a real cheesesteak?  I guess it's more of a staple, but, staple, but other places will jazz up the cheeses 
[00:29:00]  a little bit for you.  That's all I'm saying.  Come on.  That's all I'm saying if you think about it, really.  Let's go to Steve on Long Island.  Steve, didn't you call already?  You fucking mook.  Yeah, he's back, eh?  This is Steve.  You know what?  That list may suck a dick as far as being funny, but hey, 30 more punchlines than the  virus.  Fat fucking mook.  Who's a fat mook?  I don't know.  Yeah, it's not fat.  I don't know.  Are you a mook? 
[00:29:30]  Are you a mook, though?  Hey, I'm a mook, motherfucker.  But, hey.  Is he a Phillies fan of that guy?  What do you think?  I don't know.  Why is he in Staten Island?  In Long Island.  He's in Long Island.  Oh, exactly.  What are you doing?  He says I'm a mook.  Well, it might be a Met thing.  Met fans are very confused by this world.  Why don't they stop it already and fucking...  There's a whole article on how Met fans are confused by this world.  I would never fucking root for a division rival.  Oh, he said the virus, meaning the comic, the virus. 
[00:30:00]  Of course.  Hey, is the virus around today?  Because that's what he means.  He's fat.  Maybe he's got something on the Phillies.  God, the virus has to have one punchline on the Phillies.  It's got to be a riff on the Phillies.  Fucking New York thing.  You know what?  The virus is from New York.  He's a big New York fan.  He could probably come in here and riff on the Phillies and really tear him up.  He'll be laughing hysterical.  He's got to have one punchline on this World Series.  Get the virus in here.  You want the virus in here?  Where's the virus?  Are you sure? 
[00:30:30]  I want the virus in here.  I need a laugh after this horrible newspaper shit.  The virus will have us roaring.  We didn't have the virus penciled in, Anthony.  You know something?  That's the kind of show we are.  Why is Sam laughing?  Oh, Sam.  Now, why does Sam always have to come in before the virus?  Why is Sam laughing?  Because the virus just broke his headphones by slamming them onto the ground.  Why would he do that?  Here comes the virus.  The virus in the house. 
[00:31:00]  He's got his virus hat on.  Why would the virus break his fucking headphones?  Look at that.  He even brought his fake prosthetic neck.  This is like watching Eddie Murphy walking down the hallway when he did like Delirious and Raw.  This is it.  Here he is.  Yeah.  Hey, it's the virus, everyone.  Holy shit.  Hi, virus.  How are you today?  He's here.  Hey, virus.  What's going on?  Hi, guys.  Hey, virus.  How are you?  You know, we got a big World Series. 
[00:31:30]  Big rivalry.  Huge, huge rivalry.  New York and Philly going at it for the World Series.  This is big.  It's big.  This is big.  And you know something?  And a lot of shit talk back and forth between the two cities.  We read some crappy stuff in the newspaper.  We're just thinking you, being the virus, have to have something about Philly.  What do you got?  One punchline and we'll let you go.  One punchline on the big World Series.  New York versus Philly World Series. 
[00:32:00]  And what do you got?  Here we go.  One punchline from the virus.  Virus wasn't prepared for this.  But that's just it.  That's the good thing about the virus.  You could just wing it.  Riff.  This never works out well.  All we need is one punchline from the virus and we'll let you go.  Yep.  Here we go.  One punchline from the virus.  And go.  Go.  What do you got?  What do you got?  Virus. 
[00:32:30]  Philly.  One punchline.  You could go back to the office.  It just takes one.  Come on.  One lousy punchline.  Philadelphia.  Yep.  Pennsylvania.  Versus New York.  City of brotherly love.  What do you got on Philly?  What do you got?  Liberty Bell.  Ben Franklin.  Big Bell.  Crack.  Go.  One punchline from Philadelphia.  That's right.  Cheese sticker.  Go.  Cheese stays.  Rocky Balboa.  The Liberty Bell.  Ben Franklin.  Yes, sir. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  What do you got?  Here it comes.  The virus.  One punchline.  Oh.  Philly.  Here it comes.  Oh.  Oh.  I think he's got one.  Yeah.  Here it comes.  I think you're wrong.  One punchline.  That's all we ask for, virus.  One.  And then you get to go back down the hall.  Nothing's coming up. 
[00:33:30]  Come on.  Are you kidding me?  Philadelphia.  Come on.  You can do it.  Philly.  You're not a complete humorless lump.  Come on, virus.  We know you got one.  Philly.  Here we go.  Here we go.  What do you got?  Oh, here it is.  No, it isn't.  Here we go.  You got something.  One punchline. 
[00:34:00]  He's sitting on one.  Good one.  He knows.  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  Spin it out.  Virus.  Come on.  Come on.  Philly.  One thing about Philly.  The virus gets pretty red.  Yeah.  Sure does.  It's kind of like the Phillies uniform.  It gets really red.  See?  You missed that one.  Come on, virus.  How about you start with, did you hear? 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  Did you hear the Phillies are playing the Yankees in the World Series?  Just say that and maybe something will pop.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Did you hear the Phillies are playing the Yankees in the World Series?  We sure did, virus.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How about that?  Holy shit.  Wow.  Mel Allen.  That was a great call.  He is. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, my God.  How about that?  Come on, virus.  God damn.  One punchline.  One lousy punchline.  Big World Series.  What goes on in that head of yours?  I know.  It's just...  What are you thinking?  Parling nothing.  It's just synapse snapping and popping. 
[00:35:30]  If you could see inside, you know what it would look like?  It would look like a bowling ball just rolling around the inside, empty, one of those giant  gasoline tanks on the fucking turnpike.  It's a bowling ball.  Come on, virus.  We got this.  Come on.  New York is playing the Philly in the World Series.  We heard.  What about the Philly Fanatic?  Yeah.  What do you think of the Philly Fanatic?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:36:00]  Anything?  You want to think about it for a while and come back?  Might have to do that.  Is that okay, Ant?  If he thinks about it?  You know, he might need some time to write some of the brilliant, genius comedy.  Can he have one line that's not even a joke?  All right.  Yeah, that's good.  Before he goes and thinks about his joke, one observation that's not a joke.  I'd love to hear the musings of the virus. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  All right.  That's good.  A fact about Philly, New York.  World Series.  Go.  And go.  One fact.  Two countries listening.  Two countries listening.  Oh, yeah.  Well, let's go.  Here we go.  One fact.  One fact.  Doesn't even have to be funny.  About Philadelphia, right?  Yeah, the whole thing. 
[00:37:00]  Or the whole thing in general.  All right.  Go ahead, virus.  One fact.  This has turned into one fact instead of one punchline.  Anything.  How about you name the cities?  Go.  Come on, virus.  Now we're just looking for a fact.  Anything.  Anything.  Philly, New York.  Philly, New York.  And go.  World Series.  Your turn.  For the first time since 2001, World Series is going to be in November. 
[00:37:30]  You're on to the fact.  We got a fact, all right.  Yes, we do.  I was a factoid.  Sure was.  All right.  Thanks, virus.  I want you to go write some.  Work on that joke. 
[00:38:00]  Material.  There goes the virus.  There you go.  Good job.  Thanks.  Slams the door.  He didn't look anyone in the eye the whole time he was in here.  No, he's got that degrading, long walk down the hallway.  Look at him.  Shlubby.  He's just.  Didn't Steve Phillips just fuck him?  And there he goes.  Yeah.  I see.  And of course, of course, Sam's right there to give him shit. 
[00:38:30]  Iraq just punched Sam.  All right.  Virus sucks.  Poor virus.  You want to take our first break so we can get the energy back?  Hey, please.  We got an update on that that was having sex with Steve Phillips.  The virus was an abysmal disappointment.  I think.  Again.  Brian Greasy.  We got an update on his.  Bob Greasy.  Oh, right. 
[00:39:00]  Isn't Brian his son?  His son, right?  Bob Greasy.  Yes.  We got an update on his taco comment.  Bab Greasy.  And Liz Taylor twittering about This Is It, the Michael Jackson movie.  Did Bob Greasy used to play for the Vikings?  No.  It was Mayim Dolphins.  Dolphins.  Oh, it was the Dolphins.  Yeah.  He was a big quarterback.  Oh.  Wasn't he there undefeated?  I believe so.  Oh, okay.  Fran Tarkenton.  Yeah.  He was a big scrambler.  At the same time, I think.  Right?  And he was on Real People.  Wasn't that about at the same time?  Tarkenton? 
[00:39:30]  That's about right, I would say.  Yeah.  All right.  I was confused.  And we got a police officer pulling a gun on a haunted house worker.  We'll tell you why after the break, too.  Called the fuzz.  Not police officers.  O.P. and Anthony.  Stay there.  How's everybody?  Doing good.  Good.  Good.  I'm going to throw an observation out.  Hit it. 
[00:40:00]  I'm an observation.  I watch a lot of television.  And I don't fast forward through a lot of commercials and stuff.  Unless I'm DVR.  It's kind of hard to do it on live TV.  But I did notice a commercial that I think might have grabbed a lot of people's attention.  The new Ricola commercial.  Oh, really?  Now.  That's an oldie but goodie.  No, this is a new one.  It's a guy dancing with a girl, right?  It looks like one of these dance shows. 
[00:40:30]  Mm-hmm.  Da-da-da-da-da.  And her dress is going and they're dancing.  And then he lifts her up over his head and starts gagging and coughing.  Get the fuck out of here.  Swear to God.  Smelly pussy?  That's the first fucking thing.  First thing that came into my mind when I saw the commercial.  I started laughing.  I'm going, what the fuck is this?  And then her legs are straddling his shoulders now.  Here it is.  I turned the volume up.  So they're doing like a...  They're dancing. 
[00:41:00]  Look, look.  She's hot and everything.  Dancing with the stars thing, right?  All right, come on.  Does anyone have a Ricola?  Look, come on.  Is this a real commercial?  Yes.  He drops her.  Look at her legs spread.  But she's facing behind him.  Behind him.  And it's kind of sexy.  At that point.  Yeah, it was.  I found it sexy.  But the minute he pulls her up over his head, he starts hacking and coughing like stink pussy.  Look at that little ass.  There it is.  Lift her up. 
[00:41:30]  He puts on a face like, ugh.  Does anyone have a Ricola?  You see her ass cheek and everything?  That's hot, man.  Yeah, that's a nice little...  Troublesome cough.  That's the best part of the ass.  Just a little observation.  That's a great observation.  Yeah.  I think they were going for that, too.  You got to think smelly pussy.  Yeah.  That's because it's the first thing that popped into my head.  But then it turns out it's not smelly pussy.  He just...  No, he's got to cough.  He's got a little cough thing.  He's got to cough.  But you think smelly pussy at first. 
[00:42:00]  I think that during all cough medicine commercials...  Smelly pussy?  Yes.  Like when the guy would wake up for the fucking NyQuil commercial.  Yeah.  The stuff he had sneezed so you can rest medicine.  I would think his wife's pussy smells.  That's why he can't sleep.  He can't sleep.  His nose is stuffed and he's happy.  Yeah.  He said it smells like wet feet in here.  That's her vag.  Old wet feet vag syndrome she had.  The poor lady.  Ah, shit.  And she would always have an itchy vag so she'd rub it on his pillow like a dog scooting shit on the rug.  All right.  Good.  Hey, we got an update on Bob Greasy. 
[00:42:30]  Bob Greasy.  Another guy just trying to entertain his audience.  Makes a little joke.  A little off-the-cuff comment.  We got the original comment.  And we'll give you an update.  But this is how it went down over the weekend, I do believe.  Bob Greasy.  As the chase hits the halfway point, Mark Martin.  That's not Bob Greasy, obviously.  That's the main guy with the nice voice.  Yeah.  And then Bob Greasy will pop in here at the end. 
[00:43:00]  Jeff Gordon will look to close the gap on current points leader Jimmy Johnson as NASCAR's best.  Head to the shortest track on the circuit.  The chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup continues at Martinsville with coverage beginning tomorrow on ABC at 1 Eastern, 10 a.m. Pacific, presented by Goodyear.  Jimmy Johnson has won five of the last six races at Martinsville, by the way.  It's the first time we saw Jeff Gordon up there in the top five, isn't it?  Where's Juan Pablo Montoya?  He's out having a taco.  And it's Weber's back in a corner. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, boy.  I love that.  The main announcer didn't want to even acknowledge he heard that.  Oh, boy.  And, oh, boy.  Whatever.  Oh, what did I say?  What did he say?  Everyone's just got to fucking relax.  No racial humor at all.  Never.  There's no place for it, Jimmy.  None.  Not in this society.  They won't tolerate an ounce in this pussy country.  There's a whitey joke.  All whitey.  ESPN.  ESPN filled with a bunch of nervous Nellies. 
[00:44:00]  All of them are.  All of them are.  Nervous white dudes.  Every single one has white executives who will probably get some pressure because the special interest group will have a chance to do what they see as well.  That's what it is.  There's two factions here.  There is the race that the joke was made about that causes a big fucking to-do over nothing.  And then there's the corporate executive douchebags that actually listen to those people and knee-jerk react and fire people. 
[00:44:30]  Where are you coming up with this?  Stupid.  Where are you coming up with this?  That's what happens.  This malarkey.  Because I've been in the seat so many fucking times.  Yeah.  So then, obviously, Bob Greasy got yelled at.  Is he a Hall of Fame quarterback?  He's got to be, right?  So he's got to deal with some white dude's shit during the commercial break.  They yell and scream at him.  It's obvious.  Because Bob Greasy sounds like a beaten man because later in the broadcast he said this.  Listen to how depressed he sounds. 
[00:45:00]  NASCAR, Juan Pablo Montoya.  You know, he's one of the best drivers in NASCAR.  I just want to apologize for the comment that I made earlier in the ball game.  The ball game?  Did you hear what he said?  Did he say the ball game?  Well, they're calling college football.  Oh, that was a commercial for NASCAR.  Yeah, it was like a commercial for NASCAR.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Okay, okay.  I didn't understand that either.  I don't know why he was calling NASCAR.  Okay.  Yeah, while calling a college football game, Bob Greasy did that. 
[00:45:30]  So, the beauty is this.  ESPN, right?  It's supposed to be this fucking guy's sports network.  And that's how guys act.  Of course it is.  We throw the taco jokes around and the fucking fried chicken jokes around.  Let's talk about bitches, racial humor.  Right.  No, no, no.  Not in this fucking little fruity.  ESPN is fucking fruity.  Well, did it end there, guys?  Did it end there?  Bob Greasy said he was sorry.  And, you know, in that case, he meant it.  And you know what?  It was a...  You could listen to an apology and know if the guy was forced to do it or if he sort of meant it. 
[00:46:00]  He was forced to do it, but it sounds like he was sincere, right?  Not radically offensive, by the way.  No.  And he did apologize right after he said it.  It's an off-the-cuff remark.  Live television.  And, yeah, he apologized.  So, end of story.  Nope.  Bob Greasy, we do believe he's a Hall of Fame quarterback, has been suspended by ESPN.  Help, the suspension list they got over there. 
[00:46:30]  He was suspended.  How long?  I think a game.  Oh, okay.  That doesn't mean fire.  I think.  Well, you never know.  One doesn't mean fire.  Yeah, but it's the same thing as what they did to Steve Phillips.  They suspended him for a week.  Yeah, but they said a week.  Well, a game is a week, basically.  Oh.  I think he's on, like, once a week.  Oh, shit.  So, even though it says he's been suspended for a game, it's a little suspicious still.  No, they can't fire him over that.  I don't think they will either.  Wow, that's crazy.  But he's suspended for a game. 
[00:47:00]  Hmm.  I'd be scared.  Even though he apologized.  So, what does the apology even mean in that?  Yeah, so why apologize?  I'll tell you the difference.  CNN probably got a couple calls, or I'm sorry, ESPN, a couple letters over what he said.  Nobody fights in the other direction.  Yeah.  Much more of us feel like, oh, fuck that hypersensitive nonsense.  No one is writing letters or making calls in defense of Bob Greasy.  It's always been that way.  All the executives here is a few complaints, and no one defending him. 
[00:47:30]  The only reason we got fired.  Happy Typing Girl and that fucking, uh, uh.  We got fired because of Happy Typing Girl?  No, I didn't get fired.  Motherfucker.  And didn't get fired.  And that People Against Censorship?  Yeah.  When that Condoleezza Rice thing, they were out front of CBS protesting for the show.  There was another voice speaking for the show.  That's the only reason.  I firmly believe that CBS stuck with us is because Sharpton and those other scumbags couldn't  get that much leverage because there was somebody speaking back.  All you need is somebody speaking back. 
[00:48:00]  That's all you need.  And there never is.  There never is.  And they go away.  Yeah, the Sharpton wave was forming, man, but we were able to slap that down.  Thanks to people speaking back for us, yes.  We were able to slap that fucking way.  I just want to say, as a gentleman of Italian heritage, I am offended by his last name.  Bob Greasy.  Yes.  It's a bit greasy.  Thank you.  Thanks for nothing.  Why would you be?  See?  Greasy. 
[00:48:30]  There you go.  Italians are very greasy.  It's cool.  Yeah.  You have no sense of humor.  Give me out on a greasy like this.  I heard him, Ralph.  That's a dog.  Give me out on a greasy.  Fucking ESPN.  They can't keep themselves out of the limelight lately.  Why don't you just fucking act like guys?  The Sports Network.  Fucking broads don't watch college football.  Don't worry about it.  I know that wasn't well.  It's racial humor.  Guys make racial humor.  They do.  God.  Everyone I hang out with. 
[00:49:00]  I don't think taco eaters.  The Grand Wizard.  All of them.  I don't think taco eaters watch college football.  Oh my goodness.  Everyone can eat a taco.  Oh, right.  Right.  It's just a type of food that has a heritage.  Yeah.  And a lot of people like it.  I just had tacos the other day.  You enjoy a good taco?  I go to Poco Loco.  You like that pink taco?  I like Poco Loco.  I like pink tacos.  Pink taco? 
[00:49:30]  Ew.  The new black taco down at Taco Bell.  Oh, hell.  Yeah, there you go.  So you think the ESPN executive is sitting there, he gets one lousy email and one lousy  letter and just completely folds in panics?  Yes.  I would love that imitation today.  Who could do the white executive panicking over one lousy fucking email that comes in?  Oh, geez.  Yeah.  Well.  Virus can do it.  Yeah, let's get the virus right.  I bet he gets a few because they send out form letters.  Yeah.  They're organized.  They make it look like. 
[00:50:00]  But the fucking, the CEOs and the executives got to understand that the form letter is just  that.  It's bullshit.  They see that it goes to the advertisers too.  But they should ignore the form letters and the advertisers should ignore the form letters.  Yeah.  Most of those people didn't even hear the original comment.  They're just told to, you know, fucking send this in.  I wonder if Media Matters had anything to do with that.  They're the ones that targeted.  I'm just a real liberal group.  But Jimmy, you're right.  We just got to push back a little bit.  Hey, we do our, we do our job.  We push back in every single instance. 
[00:50:30]  We're not the public in the sense that the public has to call, the public has to contact  and they won't because it's not affecting them.  They don't have any real vested interest in it.  They don't realize they do until the guy's gone.  Right.  And they're like, where'd Greasy go?  Or whoever the fuck it is at the moment.  Yeah.  It's, it's apathy, man.  Nobody pushes back.  People have their own lives to live.  Yeah.  Well, in other ESPN news, I hate her name too, man.  Brooke Hundley.  I can't think of somebody I've hated publicly as much as this woman in a long time. 
[00:51:00]  Brooke Hundley.  Ozzy in 1975.  That chubby.  She, she was let go from ESPN as well.  Now this was a bit of a surprise.  They fired the mistress, Brooke Hundley.  Because I assume.  The one involved with Steve Phillips who was fired as well.  I assumed this would be a problem because she could probably turn around and start suing  everyone.  Sue everyone.  Is she related to Babe Ruth?  I see she's wearing a Yankee.  Yeah, she has a Yankee cap on.  And she kind of has the same features as Babe Ruth. 
[00:51:30]  Looks like the old Bambino.  She's less fuckable than Babe Ruth.  Would you rather stick it in the babe shitter than Brooke Hundley's?  As he is now.  Yes.  Brooke Hundley.  Good old Brooke Hundley.  That's a sexy name too.  Oh.  Oh, she's just ruining everything.  This Brooke Hundley.  Her moon is hopeful.  Nothing worse than her.  I mean, I really, she just makes me sick.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  No one likes her.  How can you?  She is so unsympathetic.  Such an unsympathetic character.  She talked to the guy's wife. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  And she's just, every guy, like she, you have this nightmare that you fuck a fat chick and  they turn around and they do this and then a picture of them with Star Wars creatures  pops up and they're holding a ray gun with fat legs and you're like, everyone knows I  dumped my fucking big gums wife for this fucking monster.  Big gums?  His wife was a gummy lady.  Oh, she certainly was.  Nice gums, dick.  Well, Jesus, you brush with fucking paint rollers. 
[00:52:30]  Can we see the gums on that lady?  Maybe they fight about her gums all the time.  I don't want to have surgery of the gums.  Well, then I'm fucking, I'm fucking Ziggy if you don't.  You're on board with the Ziggy thing?  Oh, exactly.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  She looks like Eddie Trunk.  I was in a cab.  I forgot to tell you guys.  This guy was obsessed with Eddie Trunk.  I forgot to tell him.  Oh, really?  Fucking thinks Eddie Trunk is a god. 
[00:53:00]  Because, you know, he's listening to the radio, so you always go, ah, what do you listen  to?  And you secretly hope they're going to say Opie and Anthony.  Eddie Trunk.  In this case, they didn't come close to saying Opie and Anthony, but boy, did they mention  Eddie Trunk.  Yeah.  Can't get enough of Eddie Trunk.  What was the guy's nationality?  I couldn't really tell, Ant.  About.  I couldn't tell.  You don't see color?  I do see color, but he definitely wasn't one of the, of, uh, one of those, uh, fucking,  you know.  So he wasn't Middle Eastern.  No.  Was he an African American? 
[00:53:30]  No, no, no.  He kind of had that.  Was he Hispanic?  Maybe.  Hmm.  Maybe Hispanic.  Maybe Italian.  Maybe Greek.  Oh, maybe Greek.  Uh, maybe.  I couldn't really tell.  You didn't look at his funny name on the license?  You know, I should have done that.  Yeah.  That would have gave him away.  Yeah, definitely.  But he fucking loved the Eddie Trunk guy.  You have to love Eddie Trunk.  Yeah, Eddie Trunk.  He's the fucking best music guy in the entire platform.  He knows everything.  Yes, he does.  Let's go to Psychotic.  Psychotic. 
[00:54:00]  Yes, sir.  How are you, buddy?  Good morning, people.  Hey, man.  Happy birthday, Opie.  I was calling in about this idiot haunted house worker who walked up on a cop and then  got a gun pulled on him.  I'm assuming the cop was undercover or just in plain clothes but had his pistol on him.  Yeah.  He was reeking of alcohol.  Guy walked up looking like a Michael Myers from, or no, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre killer  and had a little chainsaw with him and had a gun put in his face. 
[00:54:30]  If you see a picture of this guy, he deserves to have a gun put in his face.  Wow.  He's a bad game.  Open his eyes.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I don't get, I'm a big supporter of the cop, but if you're going to a haunted house, you  got to expect that you're going to see some crazy, scary things.  Was he at a haunted house?  Yes.  What a dick.  What is this story?  I got to hear this story.  I'm psychotic.  I don't know about it.  Psychotic.  Hold on a line.  You can help us along here, but let's get the official story.  Don't yap through the fucking story either.  He told you.  Whoa.  She's right there.  Don't yell at him.  I got to yell at the listeners because they don't listen. 
[00:55:00]  If I said, if I said, could you please not talk during the clip, he'd go, okay.  And in the middle of the clip, he'd be, I've been, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I know what that's all about, eh?  What?  You're panicking.  You don't think your Yankees can beat the Phillies and it's coming out.  See, he's talking.  Oh, well, now I'm with you.  Fuck.  Now I'm with you.  Go fuck yourself, psychotic.  Just shut up during the clip.  I got to know what this story is about.  That means shut up now.  Don't say, okay, I will.  Nothing.  Just stop talking.  Thank you.  He's from Cleveland, psychotic.  Oh, okay.  At the end of the House of Screams tour, the last scream is prompted by an intimidating sound. 
[00:55:30]  It's Mike Morrison using this.  It makes noise.  It's where all chains are.  But the chain, I take the chain off of it.  Saturday night, the skit turned into real fear with the last tour group.  The gentleman's daughter was real scared, so I went after the other adults.  And I was coming back.  He pulled a gun out on me and aimed at my chest.  It was about three feet away from me.  Baltimore County Police say the .40 caliber Glock was carried through the attraction and 
[00:56:00]  pulled out by a city sergeant, Eric Janik.  It was loaded.  He didn't shoot.  Oops.  What the fuck are you doing?  Oops.  There's a problem.  I'm a fan of the cop.  Of course.  He's so wrong.  But wow.  What are you doing?  You're in a haunted house.  You got to expect this stuff.  You pull a gun on a guy and a check on a fucking leather face outfit?  You can't do that.  He was drunk with a gun.  The cop was drunk, right?  The police sergeant smelled the booze and lied to other officers? 
[00:56:30]  Well, let me get the second half of the story here.  Psychotic.  Baltimore County Police say when they got here to the East Point Mall, Janik smelled of alcohol.  And when they first questioned him, he lied about pulling out his weapon.  He first denied taking out the gun at all.  Then he changed the story that he had taken it out, but he had pointed it to the ground.  But all the witnesses say he had pointed it right at the man.  The sergeant has been arrested for assault and suspended from the force.  That's a rough one.  Oh, jeez.  That's a rough one to defend.  Yeah.  You can't defend it.  No. 
[00:57:00]  Why would he stick around?  He's about through with that one.  He was probably like, I want this motherfucker arrested.  That guy had a chainsaw and was chasing me, motherfucker.  Chainsaw.  Those are so boring and cliche.  They're stupid.  Really?  Yeah.  So boring that it panicked a police officer.  That doesn't sound like panic to me, though.  That sounds like a guy just being a dick.  Just being like, you got a chainsaw?  Well, look at what I got.  Yeah.  Maybe he wasn't happy that he actually got scared.  He didn't think he'd be scared in there or something. 
[00:57:30]  He got like beer muscles with guns.  You have to show that you got a bigger dick.  Yeah, yeah.  We are used to getting punched and slapped and intimidated, trying to intimidate us.  But a gun, that's a completely different matter.  I probably would have shit myself if someone put a gun on me.  Yeah, there's no reason to pull a fucking gun.  I mean, come on.  You know where you are.  I can see if you just happened in an alley.  No.  Glock, glock.  You know what?  It's going to be good for business, though.  That's so scary.  Police pull guns on you.  Right.  You got to check out that one. 
[00:58:00]  No dead bodies as props.  Right.  I'll go for it.  All right, brother.  All right, thanks, boys.  Bye, mister.  Yeah, this one, you got to kind of go on the side of the guy with the chainsaw, because  that cop fucked up bad.  Sorry, cops.  Yikes.  You're not undefeated anymore.  Undefeated.  We have supported every fucking story that has come down the pipe.  Justin Mulpey?  Even that one, we support it.  Absolutely.  I want to have a little fun.  Exactly.  We all understand a little fun.  Right. 
[00:58:30]  You can all understand a little fun.  How much longer does Justin have?  They gave him 30 fucking years.  Did they give him 30 years?  Yeah, I mean, that was a hard...  He deserved to go to jail for a long time.  That was a horrible fucking...  Yeah, they really...  ...jamming my asshole with a fucking plunger.  Fuck you.  You got to go.  Boy, did they fucking put him away, though, huh?  Yeah, but that's a little...  A lot of pressure from...  That's just assault.  ...from Reverend Al and everything.  Yeah, you get murderers that aren't in for that long.  Yeah, cop...  Well, I don't think cop killers do that.  Rapists.  Shit like that.  I watch a lot of crime shows these days. 
[00:59:00]  My fucking TV plays nothing but that goddamn investigating...  ...discovery investigation channel.  Constantly, all I'm watching is forensics and fucking murders and shit.  And you see what these people get.  A lot of these guys, it was like, he was out after two brutal rapes.  He got out of prison.  Like, why is he out?  It's amazing.  Why was he ever...  And then, like, six weeks after he gets let out of prison, he kills some fucking girl 
[00:59:30]  after raping her and...  Just...  It's amazing to me.  There's a lot of open land out there.  Just keep making prisons.  Build prisons.  They keep talking about overpopulation and we got to let them out a little earlier because  we have no choice and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Sexual predators and serial killers, you can't fix them.  There's nothing like...  All right, you rob people. 
[01:00:00]  You do shit like that.  Maybe in prison.  Maybe you can be rehabilitated.  Bank robbers can be rehabilitated.  Bank robbers, yeah.  Hey, I needed some money, motherfucker.  I robbed a bank.  Well, you know something?  It's not the right thing to do.  You get a job, you do that.  It's not a sickness, for the most part, in your head that goes, must rob bank.  Must rob bank.  It's two different things.  They're both crimes, but one is committed because the guy's a fucking lunatic.  Who can't stop murdering or raping women or shit like that. 
[01:00:30]  The other one is, you know, crimes that, hey, I need some cash.  It all comes down to breastfeeding.  Oh, speaking of...  Breastfeeding?  Breastfeeding.  Hey, there you go.  It's a terrible dress.  On cue.  On cue.  You can cure a guy of...  Yeah, my hair looks good, though.  ...who's doing drugs or drug crimes because they can get sober, they can get clean.  Guys that are robbing from...  You know, you understand why people steal.  There's a difference between property crimes and stealing.  Don't get me wrong.  I still say throw them away. 
[01:01:00]  I think I go to jail.  Just throw them away.  But if you steal something, even if you put a gun in somebody's face and you steal it  and you don't hurt them, it's like you're stealing a thing or something.  If you fucking rape somebody, it's up there.  Like, rape people that knock hats off shelves, people that commit sex crimes against children.  There's just no way they should be walking around ever.  There are guys that will actually do that.  They'll walk into stores and then they take their fingers and they swoop the hat off its little perch. 
[01:01:30]  I may have done that.  Yeah, well, I think I've removed some hats from shelves at one point.  You guilty of that?  Oh, my God.  Speaking of the prison thing, Kevin in North Carolina has a nice factoid.  Go ahead, Kevin.  Here's your factoid.  What's up, boys?  Yes.  Hi.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hi, everybody.  I'm wondering if you boys know about the, on Thursday, 27 inmates are going to be released  early from prison for raping, first-degree murder, due to a technicality or a rule change 
[01:02:00]  in the prison system down here in the 70s.  What kind of rule change?  Well, in the 70s, they were given life in prison, and I believe back then they said that  life was 80 years.  Well, then they changed it, I believe, in the 80s again to life being 40 years.  So these guys, under that technicality, fall under, and they're trying to be, or they're  going to be released.  The governor down here, Governor Perdue, is doing everything she can to block it, but 
[01:02:30]  she's to no avail.  That's where the law is not working for the people.  That's where the law is not working.  So you've got 27 guys that are just very angry.  They've been in prison for 40 years, and they're, what the fuck?  Release the hounds.  Yeah, this isn't going to work out well in the end.  Life without parole.  Yeah.  Life should be life.  What's that?  You're out here, can't get jobs anyway.  And, I mean, these pieces of shit, how are they going to fucking find a job?  They're not.  Ding, ding, ding, ding!  What the fuck are they going to do? 
[01:03:00]  I'm punching out, boys.  All right.  Well, that's not a good factoid.  We need a fun factoid.  That one was depressing.  Oh, that was a sad little factoid.  I hated that factoid.  Hey, we got the paranormal activity people coming in today.  Boo!  A couple of the actors from that movie coming in in about an hour.  Oh, no.  I was saying boo like scary.  Okay.  We can boo later, though.  Did you see the movie?  No.  I wanted to.  I wanted to, too, yesterday.  Aw, shit, yo.  I really wanted to.  We better watch that trailer like 20 times.  Let's just watch the trailer a lot. 
[01:03:30]  Dude, it was great to plot where everybody went, ah.  Yeah.  Oh, that was scary.  Let's just talk about how it only cost $15,000.  Like they haven't heard that a thousand times.  The goal is to bring it up 10 times during the interview.  Can we do it?  10 times?  Tag team?  Can we do it?  Are we going to tag team it?  Hell fucking yeah.  Any way you can fucking get it in there.  Brock Lesnar forced to postpone next fight from November to January.  What?  All us UFC fans very depressed about that one.  He's ill.  Rumor has it he might have the swine flu.  He's been fighting something for like three weeks. 
[01:04:00]  Well, he should win then if he's fighting it.  And we were all excited because it was right around the corner at this point.  And now it's going to be in January, Brock Lesnar.  Oh, it's terrible.  Oh, yeah.  It's terrible.  Why don't we take a break?  We got today's Jacktober sitting right in front of me.  We can squeeze this in before the paranormal activity people.  When are they supposed to get here?  8.30?  Oh.  An hour.  An hour.  Okay?  Yeah.  Is this a plan or what?  I don't know if my sandwich is here yet.  All right.  So you want to stall?  Better be.  You want to stall then? 
[01:04:30]  We can stall.  One more thing.  We'll do something.  All right.  Let's go to Rhett in D.C.  Rhett.  Hey.  What's up, guys?  Oh.  But you know what?  Hold on.  The Coke Logic makes a very good point.  Never.  About fucking time.  Worthless shite bag.  Shite bag.  How are the actors coming in if it was a true story?  Uh-oh.  Oh, now we got a problem.  You're on to everybody on that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:05:00]  Rhett, what do you got?  Great.  I actually had the pleasure of going to college with Brooke Hunley, and the pictures online  don't do her justice.  She's actually much uglier in person.  Really?  Jesus, this poor Brooke Hunley.  She defriended me and a bunch of my buddies on Facebook, because apparently a lot of people  were taking some unflattering pictures and sending them along to the post.  Right.  So she got worried about that and got rid of all of them.  Oh, really? 
[01:05:30]  All right, well.  Yeah.  Any nakeds?  Uh, God, no.  No.  Oh, damn it.  Was she normal in college?  What was her thing?  She was a big communications, like TV radio geek.  And, uh, her big claim to fame was, I think, in her sophomore year, she got this article  published in the paper that was basically how to score an internship and how to do it  by, like, sucking up and networking.  Sucking up.  It's so much funnier now when you read it with all of this in contact. 
[01:06:00]  Mm.  What a vengeful bitch, though.  To contact the guy's wife, then to be his kid's friend on fucking Facebook.  Yuck.  Yeah, faking.  Fucking yuck.  Beat it.  You took a little fucking dick.  Now, fucking hit the bricks.  God almighty, is that annoying.  Yeah.  Someone else, uh, bad.  Steve Phillips is a dope, too.  He is.  Of course he is.  Get a hooker, you fucking privileged Met asshole.  What a dick.  The hooker's not gonna show up on your front fucking door. 
[01:06:30]  Dude, exactly.  You can write letters to your wife.  Right.  Exactly.  With fucking Hillary Clinton legs.  Right.  Old, old, fucking, awful, horrible, straight meatloaf hair.  Hey, I want a fucking meatloaf from the Bat Out of Hell video.  That's what she looks like.  You pay the hooker to leave, right, Jimmy?  I'd pay her to suck my dick and put a big clit on my nose.  So I look like Ziggy from the cartoon.  And someone else said that some of those prisoners are getting out because of good behavior.  When you have, when you're in prison for horrendous shit, there should be nothing called good behavior. 
[01:07:00]  You have to behave good.  Right.  That should just be, yeah, what you have to do.  Well, you don't get your meals.  Not a privilege, right.  That should be the reward for good behavior.  You eat.  Exactly.  Well, they don't fuck you with a big electrical stick.  Well, they don't pinch your balls with little lobster claws.  Ow.  That would suck.  You imagine if that was punishment, they let a crab grab the head of your penis?  Ooh.  A big crab.  What if you just touched it lightly, though? 
[01:07:30]  And you came on it.  Yeah.  Come on him.  You imagine, I wonder if anybody's ever tried to fuck a crab or a lobster.  Because people fuck horses and dogs.  You can't fuck a crustacean or a mollusk.  Has anyone ever tried to fuck, has anyone ever injured their penis fucking a sea creature?  That's a very urchin.  I don't know.  You can probably fuck a sea urchin, but you better get one that isn't poisonous.  They're all fucking spiky.  Yeah.  Well, they're soft spikes. 
[01:08:00]  I eat them.  You want to take that chance?  I've diddled a sea urchin in California a few times when I lived there.  You diddle them and they go, and they close up.  On you?  Yeah.  They close on your finger.  And then you pull your finger out.  I could feel good on the head of your penis.  No, it didn't hurt.  What a dork.  I never thought of fucking one, though.  You know?  Sometimes I talk for myself.  Oh, what?  It's okay.  I had a nice penis line.  Oh, did you?  About the head of your penis.  It would have felt good on.  Oh, it probably would have.  As you said that, I heard it.  And I was thinking, I wonder if there's any type of a liquid they release that would hurt your dick. 
[01:08:30]  And just like some kind of acid?  Right.  Like, if you put your dick in it, they save that for guys that try to fuck them.  You think it's nature's way to keep the penises away from their fucking sea urchin feeling pussy?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  God, is she horrendous.  Well, that one's not bad.  See, that one doesn't look bad.  Look at the Brooke Hundley picture.  That's the fucking Facebook voodoo, though, that they're doing.  Ew!  That's horrible.  Who is that? 
[01:09:00]  That's not her.  You don't like Brooke Hundley?  She's got a double chin.  Double?  Look at that chin.  That is a big-ass chin.  Wow.  She must be a lot fatter than the pictures they're showing.  Holy shit, are they bad pictures.  Poor Brooke Hundley.  Do you feel bad for her?  Not even a little.  I hate her.  I don't respect her at all, and I don't feel bad for her.  To me, she's every guy's nightmare.  Well, she's delusional to think that it was more than what it was.  I think she's more than delusional.  Steve Phillips was just trying to fucking get rid of the poison, and she thought there was something there.  She looks like meatloaf.  Yeah, that's just fucking vicious. 
[01:09:30]  Little meatloaf.  That's the meatloaf thing I was telling you about, Ant, where he put the wig on.  To make himself look like the young meatloaf.  Steve Phillips is an asshole, but she's a vicious fucking bitch.  To contact that fucking guy's wife.  I have more of a problem with Brooke Hundley than fucking Steve Phillips.  He's just an asshole, but she's vicious.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You know how the dick is.  It's very hard to talk to it.  You know, so if that comes up to you, and it knows how to spit on your cock and twist the hand.  No way.  No?  No.  Why was he fucking her then if she wasn't any good? 
[01:10:00]  Because he's a dope.  He's a dope.  You think it was just basic stuff, or she did something that he fantasized about?  They probably joked about anal sex, and maybe she said she liked it.  Who knows?  Maybe he plowed her in the pooper.  Maybe.  Or maybe she plowed him in the pooper.  Who the fuck knows?  Maybe it was some weird shit.  Look at her.  Try to bat.  Can we see that one?  Please show the Star Wars picture again.  I can't get enough of the Brooke Hundley pictures.  I love the Brooke Hundley pictures.  They're the fucking greatest things I've ever seen.  What a fucking beast. 
[01:10:30]  Look at her.  I love her shoes.  The Stormtrooper and Darth Vader.  Look at her awful retard slippers.  She is horrible.  She's terrible.  Are those the fucking Adidas slip-on?  Yeah, those fucking giant flip-on.  Even the Star Wars creatures are like, what is this fucking thing?  Princess Leia cake.  Pig.  Full of fat.  They got Brooke Hundley pictures on TV now, too. 
[01:11:00]  So we got them on our computer that's on TV.  Oh, yeah.  She's all over the place.  I like it.  I like it a lot.  That's fantastic.  She looks like that little creature in E-Rock.  An E-Rock.  Holy shit.  Oh, man.  It's the little E-Rocks.  Jesus.  Oh, God.  She stopped and got that picture on her way to the fucking Star Wars cantina to do her musical gig.  Yuck.  Shut up, fatty. 
[01:11:30]  Getting back to lobsters.  Steven asked for Bayshore.  You can fuck a lobster, but you have to dip your cock in melted butter first.  Oh.  That's true.  You got to load that shit up, Ant, if you're going to try it.  Oh, another TV observation.  All right.  Because, like I said, I've been watching a lot.  I like your last one.  Your last one was terrific.  Yeah.  I've been watching a lot of these crime shows, and True TV has a lot of them.  Used to be Core TV.  Now it's called True TV.  And True TV is fucking fake TV.  True TV equals fake TV. 
[01:12:00]  Well, it can't be.  It's called True TV.  No.  Why don't they just call it fake TV?  Reality, actuality is their slug line.  And I watch it a lot, but I only watch the crime shows about real shit.  That fucking stupid repo show, anyone who thinks that's real, could you just please put  a shotgun in your mouth and pull the trigger right now?  Yeah, we did this one already.  Yeah.  But now they saw how successful that is, so they're starting other shows that are completely 
[01:12:30]  fake.  You're trying to tell me the repo show, which we all know is fake, is really successful?  It's getting a job done?  It's apparently...  Holy shit.  They're making a movie based on it?  Yes.  They're not.  I've heard this.  Yes, they are.  They have one called Repo Manor, and it's a movie.  This is about the people that are apparently these repo people, who are not, by the way.  Could we see a scene out of that, Danny?  They're not fucking repo people.  And it's so obvious when the camera... 
[01:13:00]  No one acknowledges the camera.  Like, the people that are mad that their car's being repoed will stand there throwing things  at the repo man as the camera is right next to their head and never look into the camera,  never acknowledge things, never throw stuff at the camera.  If you're going to be mad, you'd be going after the camera guy, too.  You'd be mad at everybody.  Everybody in sight.  And then when the guy jumps into the truck to rush off with the repoed car, the cameraman's  already in the car, like, waiting for him to get in there. 
[01:13:30]  You're not parked in front of your house.  What do you mean?  Oh, yeah.  A hearse being towed.  Is there a body in it?  You're working another funeral home with somebody else's funeral home's hers?  No, I'm working for the funeral home.  Not for the one we're here for.  Not for the one we're here for.  Not for the one we're here from.  The place you used to work at.  So fake.  I can't even remember.  Are you playing games?  No, because it's so phony.  I'm just dragging down the street on its nose.  No, no, no.  I'm just saying.  And they're all tough guys.  No, we're going to the job.  Over there.  You have a coffin in the back.  You're sitting in the middle of the day on the street.  You know what you're trying to tell me?  We're not just a body. 
[01:14:00]  You know, we're not stupid.  We don't help.  They're saying there's a body in there?  Yeah, they try to make it.  Every repo.  Every repo is outrageous.  Listen to me, man.  One guy took some.  You know what?  If there's a body in there, you know that we can't take it, man.  Don't be f***ing.  You can't take it.  You absolutely can't take it.  All right, well, if there's a body in there, we'll leave it.  No, I was absolutely positive that he did not have a corpse in the back of that car.  That guy's p***.  If there's a body in there, we're going to leave it.  Yeah, we got it.  Are you hooked up?  Yeah, dude, I'm like anxious from being hooked.  Okay, then you can't hook up because we're going to a service right now. 
[01:14:30]  We're going.  We can't do nothing if there's a body in there.  Yeah, there's a body in here.  You know what?  Right.  It's such bullshit.  It's bad acting.  Yeah, it's bad acting.  They're always getting into these fights that they never show them actually hitting people.  It's just all phony.  But the.  Don't take off your buddy.  Oh, now they're going to open up the coffin.  Is that what they do?  Yeah, I'm a little familiar with some of these lots. 
[01:15:00]  Why don't we call the police and have them come over here and you can explain it to them.  You don't need a coffin.  Oh, say they're going to call the police.  It was off forever and we would sit through.  No, no, I understand.  But now there's another show called Worked Up.  What's Worked Up?  Worked Up appears to be.  I can't really tell.  Shows Anthony on certain websites.  Yes, I do get a little worked up.  I think they're process servers.  And yeah, they're serving subpoenas and summonses to certain people that have to show up in court. 
[01:15:30]  And again, it's this fake, badly acted people coming out and fake assaulting the process servers.  So it's just, it's bullshit.  They show people getting guns pulled on them and the cameraman is just steadily holding the camera.  If there's a gun out there, you're pretty much going to duck for cover.  Why doesn't the average viewer know it's fake?  I don't get it.  Because they're stupid and because it's... 
[01:16:00]  I know there's stupid people out there, but I mean, there's enough people buying into it to make these shows popular.  And that confuses me.  They're disillusioned because it's called true TV.  It doesn't matter what the fucking channel's called.  So you think you're seeing something real.  And then they say actuality, not reality, actuality.  It's not.  It's fake.  What is this one?  And actuality can mean that they're just...  Is this a guy getting served?  Yeah.  You want to turn that up?  The papers got served right back.  What is this?  See, the cameraman's in the car.  Now he's outside the car again. 
[01:16:30]  It's a five-camera shoot.  Then this process server won't get a paycheck.  You know, I got to go back in.  He's following the guy.  But I need to get paid.  I got bills to pay.  Byron has no choice but to go in again.  Now he's going to go in, really?  Now the cameraman's outside the car.  Now he's taking a chance at...  He's at the door.  Now he's taking a chance at getting shot.  You've been served.  Oh, man.  I tell you, you must have a death wish, man.  You must have a death wish.  Get off my property.  Don't touch me.  Brother, listen.  Get off my property.  You not put your hand in.  The camera's right there.  I got to put him in the report that you were served personally. 
[01:17:00]  Come on, man.  Get off my property.  I'm out of here, all right.  Get up out of here, man.  Don't let me see you around here again, man.  For real, man.  You're right.  The camera's outside.  Get up out of here.  Yeah.  Now the camera's outside the car.  And he's not acknowledging.  He's driving away.  Look, the camera.  Now where's the camera?  Now he's back in the car.  The camera filmed him driving away.  Like me on a regular basis.  Now he's talking to the guy.  We need to find a new job because, yo, it's sort of like a death wish, man.  Is it?  You did nothing.  I'm the one showing them. 
[01:17:30]  I'm just the bearer of the bad news.  Take your beef up with the plaintiff.  Plaintiff.  Plaintiff.  Yeah.  But this is phony.  I have my reservations about bait car.  Really?  Yes.  I'm suspicious of bait car.  It might be a...  The quotes I've seen look...  Oh, boy.  Maybe I'm a dummy like the rest of the viewers.  It looks real because it's all done with those hidden cameras inside a car.  Right.  But I'm not sure if that could be done legally. 
[01:18:00]  Because then they question the people about it.  They go, didn't you see the hidden camera?  What were you thinking?  Like, they're asking him too many questions that could probably be used in court and ruin the case.  Like, it just...  To me, it seems very fake.  And there's another one that I just know is absolutely fake, too.  Can't remember the name.  But the only shows that are real on that are the documentaries of murders.  Maybe actuality.  I think Hope's right. 
[01:18:30]  It means something different.  To say reality is, like, really misleading.  But actuality...  No actuality just means maybe it's based on something that was real, based on a real case or whatever.  Supposedly, the repo show, it's supposed to be actual repos that these people are reenacting.  Yeah.  But, you know, everyone's a drama.  Some guy actually took a fucking bulldozer and lifted up the car with the bulldozer and tipped it over and drilled a hole through the top of it. 
[01:19:00]  Why are they reenacting it?  Nobody wants to see...  Reenactments were great in, like, 1985.  Yeah.  But with the internet now and beheadings and shooting, there's nothing should be reenacting.  You can see everything.  I can see fucking grocery store surveillance camera footage of shootings that actually happened and shit like that.  I don't need a reenactment.  You saw Drunkest Guy Ever, right?  That video?  What was that?  Oh, my God.  Drunkest Guy Ever?  Steve Phillips?  I think I'd like to fuck you.  She's hot. 
[01:19:30]  There you go.  Oh, beer goggles.  Jesus.  Drunkest...  Beer hubbles.  YouTube's Drunkest Guy Ever is...  This video is unbelievable.  Is this real?  I hope so.  We're all hoping it is.  Drunkest Guy Ever.  You haven't seen this yet?  He walks in.  Oh, he's doing the...  I'm leaning backwards walk.  Yeah.  I did that at Bar 9 once.  Right before I threw up black vomit from Jägermeister.  He's great.  He looks like he's trying to walk during an earthquake.  He's really just very unstable on his feet. 
[01:20:00]  He is really hammered.  It almost looks like he's doing the Randall from Clarkson.  Yeah, the Randall.  He's not quite shaking as much, but he's doing the Randall.  He's got a lot of views.  The Randall.  Yeah, this thing is doing very well.  Let me say hi.  We'll get to the best part of...  Here we go.  He's trying to get more beer, basically.  Of course he is.  He can't stop leaning backwards, though.  He's just falling over into the chips.  As you keep watching that.  Jordan in Oregon.  Jordan.  That's fake.  Yeah, hey.  My uncle did that show down in L.A., and it was all set up. 
[01:20:30]  They actually put a car in my grandma's yard and repoed it.  It's fake.  Yeah.  On the show.  Yeah, it's all fake.  Don, look at this fucking Drunkest Guy video.  I think Drunkest Guy ever might be fake.  That's totally fake.  When he rode the fucking doors, he opened up the beer cooler.  Could be fake.  Say that again, Jordan.  It probably works there.  What's that?  Say that again.  They set it up.  They put the car in my grandma's yard and aired it on TV. 
[01:21:00]  Fake.  Come on.  Fake.  Fake.  He protected his head when he fell.  Totally fake.  Drunkest Guy ever is...  Completely fake.  Fake.  Fake.  Fake.  Fake.  Totally fake.  Go ahead, Jordan.  Punch it out, boy.  All right.  It's an awful slapstick.  When he fell on his back, he made sure his head was up so it didn't smash on the ground.  We've all seen drunk people fall.  We've all been drunk and fallen.  Who believes...  Hey, look at this guy.  Dude, this is the funniest ever.  Look, it's real.  We, uh...  Fake.  Fake.  Totally fake. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, it's ridiculous.  It's real, I swear.  I have him on the phone if you'd like to speak with him.  He sounds intoxicated and he's from Australia.  Yes, and he knows what a store is.  And that's how you executive produce Greatest Humiliation Ever.  So good.  His name's Corey.  His name's Corey.  He's from Australia.  We got him.  I have procured him for you.  How'd you get him?  I dialed C in the Australian phone book. 
[01:22:00]  Yes.  I dialed Australia with the letters.  Travis, you gotta play that.  Of course.  I think it was a production piece that gives you the basics of that one.  And he said that's when you executive produce.  That's how you executive produce.  We had too much going on, but Jordan from Oregon was on the phone and basically said that  I think it was his uncle actually was on that show Repo Man.  Yeah.  And he said it was all set up.  It's all set up.  And I don't know how many other ones are fake that are on this true TV.  But I think any of their original programming is phony. 
[01:22:30]  I'm not buying it.  Bait car looked good, but I have my doubts.  I have my doubts about Bait car.  Too many lawsuits would happen, right?  Yeah.  I think I'm loving, you know, the documentary style shit where they go after serial killers  and talk to real cops and show interrogations and things like that.  But any of the other stuff, bullshit.  With that, let's take a break because we want to clear the field.  Clear the field.  We want to get Jack Tober in before the paranormal activity people come in, okay? 
[01:23:00]  Right.  So quick break and we'll do Jack Tober right out of the break.  Stay there.  Stay there.  Ant, what do you got?  Shut up.  I got a mouthful of salmon.  Ant eating his sandwich.  Let's not forget the paranormal activity people will be here in a half hour.  Did you know that that movie only cost $15,000 to make?  $15 million?  What?  $15,000.  No way. 
[01:23:30]  We're going to fit that little fact into our interview ten times, hopefully.  Ten times without them noticing.  I heard that wasn't true.  Really?  I'm just practicing.  I like it.  We're going to squeeze Jack Tober in before we get the paranormal activity people in here.  Oh, thank God.  What do we got today?  And there's a lot of controversy about the guest bookings for this radio show.  Something is not making sense.  I guess we didn't behave, so they're not booking Hulk Hogan on our show or something. 
[01:24:00]  Fuck Hulk Hogan, then.  Who cares?  Fuck him.  Yeah, what are we going to talk about?  Well, brother.  Yeah, I don't really give a shit if we have Hulk Hogan on our show.  I do give a shit that we're being punished for not behaving.  That's the publicist.  The publicist is mad at us because we kept Brooke Hogan on our show too long.  Like for three minutes longer than she was supposed to be on?  Because she wanted to continue, by the way.  Yeah.  It wasn't like we forced her to stay in studio.  And this fucking...  If the story's true, I don't even know if the story's true, but supposedly we didn't behave. 
[01:24:30]  Well, he wasn't behaving.  We had a good conversation with her.  We plugged her fucking album.  And now what?  Hulk won't come on?  Well, the company should tell the publicist that we're not taking any of your fucking guests  until you do the right thing.  What questions are we going to ask him anyway?  So that lame leg drop that you do.  Come on.  What?  Shut up.  Don't take this out on the Hulk.  We didn't follow the rules, Anthony.  God forbid that Opie and Anthony not follow the rules. 
[01:25:00]  It's helped us in the past.  And then we're hearing that...  Wow-wee.  Wow-wee.  Yeah, look at Kenny's ass.  Wow-wee.  There she goes.  Hold on.  Gotta get the ass look.  There we go.  You have it.  Amy.  And so you hear him like...  There's another one. 
[01:25:30]  What was the other fucking one?  Oh, Sting.  Wrestler.  Sting the Wrestler.  Not Sting the Wrestler.  It's Sting from the police.  Oh, it's Sting from the police.  Well, we don't...  We shouldn't get Sting.  Why?  Because we're scumbags in this business.  Why would we get Sting?  Sting.  Well, look at us.  Why would Sting come in here and talk to us?  Sting for some reason.  Sting scumbags.  Is only doing classical fucking Christmas channels.  What?  It's not a joke.  That wouldn't be a joke.  It's not funny. 
[01:26:00]  Here's something.  It's the truth.  Here's something.  When you do interviews, maybe pick a couple interviews where people would listen to it.  A channel where people will actually listen.  What are you thinking about?  He's doing Christmas channels.  Apparently, he's just doing fucking classical Christmas and some other holly channel.  Listen to me.  Get the fuck out of here.  That's a joke.  It'd be fun to get him in, but he would be a fucking bore.  He got mad at me because I asked for a second picture backstage because the first one was all shit.  No one was looking at the camera. 
[01:26:30]  And I even said, Mr. Sting, I'm really sorry, but can we do that again?  And he got so fucking annoyed.  Wow.  There was only 10 of us that he had to take pictures with.  He would be such a...  He probably would be.  That was back when the company took care of us.  Elo.  Like, it would probably just be the most boring interview ever.  Well, you know, I feel that the music is...  Shut up!  At least he's not continuing with that lute playing.  Oh, you've got a lot of pictures of Sting with his dick out.  Oh, Sting.  How embarrassing. 
[01:27:00]  That's all he's got going on?  Oh, Sting.  No wonder he could fuck for 18 hours.  The woman never feels it until the 17th hour.  He doesn't hit the walls.  Jesus.  Oh, Sting.  That's all he's got going on?  He's got a little stinger.  It's a nub.  A little nub.  Wow.  I hope you're swimming in the cold water.  What the fuck's wrong with you?  Helen.  If you're going to be photographed naked, you've got to fluff it up a little bit.  Why is that other guy bending him naked?  What the fuck is going on?  Sting is getting stretched out as he's nude in a beach setting by another dude. 
[01:27:30]  See how much fun it would be to just have him in and have those pictures up?  Oh, yeah.  So right when he walks in, he just sees that and goes, well...  Is he all ball bag?  Is that what's going on?  Yeah, I think he's all satchel.  Danny, what do you got going on over there?  Is he all ball bag?  I've got about four looking at these.  Ew.  Sting's asshole.  He's got just as much crank as beans.  Maybe if he shaved all his pubes, he would be British. 
[01:28:00]  And the British people are the worst.  Just shave it.  Just fucking zilches.  Fucking clean it up a little bit.  Don't make it look bigger.  Sam, let's do some Jacktober.  No baseball players.  We can't get his guests.  It's fucking Louis.  The company has fucking Major League Baseball.  And then it gets back to me that we bitch too much.  Really?  Like, this bitching is not justified?  Of course it is.  You basically own Major League Baseball.  The World Series is New York and Philly.  Two huge teams for this radio show.  And we can't get a fucking... 
[01:28:30]  Nothing.  Maybe we could get a Bat Boy.  We can't get nothing.  Nothing.  Something.  At this point, I don't even know who runs the fucking channel.  I don't even know.  Yeah, I know.  What the fuck's going on?  Jesus Christ.  We're holding our end up.  Unbelievable.  No Tracy Morgan.  No Hulk Hogan.  No Sting and his Loot.  No baseball players.  Because they booked a show with them for the guests or booked the rest of the platform.  Hey, do you want to do Opie and Anthony and the gay channel and the fucker this channel 
[01:29:00]  and that channel?  It's just mentioned as one of many.  It's not special.  It's not talked about like it's special.  They don't give a fuck if they say, no, fuck Opie and Anthony.  They go, okay, fine.  We'll just put you in the rest of them.  They don't care.  That's why...  And Steve Leeds is great.  And I like Liam a lot.  I don't think the other people there care for us.  That's why we fought for Roland.  Because Roland booked for our show.  Just the guests that were coming through our door.  A-listers.  Yeah.  Now we get shit-listers.  If we get anything.  I don't even know what that means.  Hey, what are you guys talking about?  We got the stars of the number one movie in America coming in today. 
[01:29:30]  That's true.  Hey, who did they ask us about recently?  And we look at them like, you're kidding, right?  I love when they ask it when Steve comes in.  It's the most lame fucking guest ever.  We say no to all of them.  No, I like when Steve comes in with a good guest.  Oh, yeah.  And we just laugh.  And we laugh like they're not good.  So, yeah.  Al Pacino will be in the building.  Do you want him?  Do you guys want to see if I can get Mel Gibson?  Yes.  Yeah, dude.  Mel Gibson's going to be coming through. 
[01:30:00]  I want Steve, because I don't know what he does either.  I want him to take five minutes out of his very busy morning.  And I want him to come in here with a list of guests.  My breakfast.  Yes.  A list of guests.  A wheelbarrow.  A list of guests we said yes to that we never got.  That's a simple little task for Steve.  But, Sam, you got to stay here, because we got to do Jacktober.  Okay.  Uh-huh.  You are going to walk away.  What do we got for Jacktober today? 
[01:30:30]  Well, I figured we'd stay in New York, because we were in New York yesterday.  Oh.  And we got to represent properly.  But I also felt like the audience probably, especially the people who have been with us  for a long time, want to know what's going on at the stations that got rid of the Opie  and Anthony show, because maybe there is a better show.  That's fucking brilliant.  Can you go down to West Palm Beach next?  I want to see what the Lopeweiser people are about.  West Palm Beach is already being monitored as we speak.  Thank you, Sam.  Let's just say their slogan is live and local. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, God.  Ew.  Back from every song with Loper, Smitty, and Randy, live and local.  Live and local.  Live and local.  The fact that they have to push local, terrestrial radio sucks dick.  Remember that fucking PD that didn't want us in town for his big concert?  He just said, all right, walk on stage.  They didn't even announce it.  We're not local.  He goes, no, we were asking you, why are there no Opie and Anthony posts?  It's your morning show. 
[01:31:30]  Well, you know, it's a different crowd.  What?  Shut the fuck up.  And then he put us in a broom closet for two hours.  Remember that fucking PD?  It was terrible.  We've never felt more not invited in our lives.  That's where the company should have stepped up, though.  That's where the company.  But what happened was.  I think the company forced them to invite us down for their big, I don't know what the  fuck they called it, you know, their rock show.  The bake sale.  And as soon as we got there, we realized they did not want us there whatsoever.  It was so obvious. 
[01:32:00]  It was so fucking obvious.  It was so uncomfortable.  Yeah.  Well, they didn't want the show.  But what happened was after.  And he finally got his way and he got rid of us and he put on the Lopweiser people.  Loper and Smitty, who are now Loper, Smitty, and Randy.  They added a lovely young lady named Randy.  Oh.  Following the formula.  I like it.  Who also happens to be Loper's fiance.  Oh, get that audio.  Tomorrow?  It's being monitored.  Get that audio.  Yeah, they wouldn't put me on when I was down in West Palm.  The whole station would have done nothing to do with me.  So fuck that station and fuck that Cornwall morning show. 
[01:32:30]  Live and local.  Live and local.  Yuck.  But that's not today's show.  And I want E-Rock to look at the ratings.  I want to see how well the Loper show is doing.  Since we were kicked to the curb.  Who was the guy that took over president after, what was his name?  Joel, who left?  Dude, who left CBS?  Oh, the Flying Hollander brothers?  Yeah, Hollander.  Joel Hollander?  He was a big supporter of us.  Yes, he was.  Who came in after him?  Dan Mason, who met with us once and then... 
[01:33:00]  He fucking did nothing to help this show.  He didn't really, I don't know.  He didn't like the show or he would have helped it.  Yeah, I don't know what he was up to.  I have no idea.  Yeah, he's doing a terrific bang-up job over there.  Right.  Okay, here we go.  Jack Tober.  We look at, what, Chunky from 92.3 Now?  Yes, we are going to our old homestead that used to be K-Rock in New York.  Oh, nice.  It's now 92.3 Now.  And, yes, after over a year, it's been a long time.  Well, it was 92.3 then. 
[01:33:30]  No, no, no.  It's 92.3 Now.  They kicked us to the curb like seven months ago.  Okay.  Six, seven months ago.  Seems like longer.  Has it been that long since we're off that shit platform?  Wow, yeah.  Seems like longer.  Don't make the Asian voices.  They do not.  Fucking pussies.  The whole shit platform can die.  But we're playing Chunky's show because in the end, let's be honest, we're just jealous.  We're just jealous.  Of Chunky.  Yeah.  We know that Chunky's better than us.  Jealous why?  When he does the virus? 
[01:34:00]  We just know that Chunky's better than us.  This is why we're doing this.  They don't have a morning show still.  No.  So I wanted to.  How embarrassing is that for us?  They kicked us out and never replaced us.  That's smart.  That's some good management skills right there.  I was thinking, who is the voice of the station then?  And we played a little bit of Lisa Page.  You remember her Jay-Z interview.  Oh, how could we forget that?  I did.  It was horrendous.  We've spoken about Tic Tac and the Freak Show, of course.  Tic Tac and the Freak Show.  Which is just their crazy afternoon show. 
[01:34:30]  But I feel wild.  You can't call yourself the Freak Show if you can't do anything freaky or wild.  He's a little nuts.  But I feel the true essence of 92.3 now is Chunky.  The Chunkster?  The Chunkster.  Remember when we first visited Chunky?  Yes.  And he had like 28 followers or something.  All right.  And we kicked him off Twitter.  And he was the one who, on his first day, the elevator wasn't working.  And he had to walk up all those flights of stairs, remember? 
[01:35:00]  And somehow all nine elevators were not working.  Oh, right, right, right.  We called him out on the fact that.  He just made up the story.  Yeah, local.  I'm having a hard day, too, folks.  Story.  Hey, I know we're all over the place, but the Loper Show.  Yeah, Loper and Schmitty and Randy.  And Randy now.  Getting a little intel here.  They did a hack bit two weeks ago where Loper got engaged live on the air.  Ew!  Well, the fun thing is now on Randy's blog. 
[01:35:30]  Again, this is tomorrow's show.  Yeah, don't get it.  Yeah, we're all over the place.  That's tomorrow, the West Palm Beach Show.  Sure.  But on Randy's blog, she is showing some of the places that she and Loper might live.  Some of the, you know, apartments and stuff.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Can I see a picture of him, Daniel?  Do we have a picture?  Yeah, let's say hi to Ryan in Indiana as Danny finds that.  Ryan's got something on the Hulkster.  Ryan.  Oh, fucking can't eat rape.  The reason the Hulkster will come on the show, he doesn't want to be humbled. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, yeah, that's a good point.  That's right.  He doesn't want to be humbled by the Iron Sheik.  That's why he's not doing our show.  We might be considered Team Sheik over here.  I think we're Team Sheik.  Yeah.  That's a problem.  Oh, Loper and Smitty.  Let's see what she looks like.  All right.  Is she looking any good?  Loper's kind of a tough guy, so you don't want to, you know.  Is he?  I'm not going to do anything.  I just want to look.  All right.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Oh, she's all right.  Yeah.  She's Zite.  They have a commercial, but you guys can't watch it yet. 
[01:36:30]  You have to wait for tomorrow.  Damn it.  All right.  Let's stop with the Loper thing.  Tomorrow's the Loper show thing.  Ew.  You shouldn't wear a cutoff shirt if you have absolutely no hint of a muscle.  Did you see the ink?  Yeah, I see the ink.  A lot of ink.  Bro?  Well, that's good.  Bro?  You've got to put ink on to look tough.  They used to be called Loper and Smitty.  Right, but then they added Randy, who is Loper's fiancé, to the mix.  Which one's Loper?  Loper's the tough guy.  Well, they're both tough guys. 
[01:37:00]  No, no, no.  Loper is like the, hey, dude, don't mess with me.  I don't have any sleeves.  How did they pull that spinal tap move where they got the fucking chick involved?  God damn.  There's somebody, you know, already in the organization, close enough, that could take over the job.  You don't mean your fucking wife.  She has nice...  I've got to say, she's got very sexy love.  Nothing wrong with her.  Yeah, she's a nice-looking woman.  And it adds a whole new thing in, because now Smitty...  She just doesn't belong on the radio.  Now Smitty is like, what am I, the third wheel here? 
[01:37:30]  Oh, you guys.  Oh, shit.  You know, it's crazy.  It's crazy.  Oh, shit, he is.  All right, that's all for tomorrow, though.  Let's stop.  That's for tomorrow.  Tomorrow, we'll really dive into the Loper show.  What a tease.  Because there's so much with Chunky.  You guys are forgetting about Chunky.  All right.  Let's refocus.  Chunky, the guy on our old station here in New York.  Yes, he does.  It's called 92.3 Now, I guess.  He does the evenings.  Let's get up some Chunky picture.  How's that slogan working for the old station?  92.3 Now?  Well, very good.  Isn't every radio station now?  No, no, no.  Many radio stations are then, as in yesterday's news. 
[01:38:00]  Right.  92.3, because they play the hits, is now.  What about the bed sheets that are being hung up over the expressway that I've seen?  That says 93 Now, spray-painted on it.  Yeah.  It's supposed to look like viral marketing, but it's not.  Yeah.  No, I think some kids just did that, because it's such a popular station.  Oh, is that what happened?  Yeah.  Some kids are just like, I love that station.  Jimmy, you can't just pass what Jimmy said.  Is there anything worse than fake viral marketing?  Fake viral marketing.  Oh, horrible.  Fake viral marketing. 
[01:38:30]  Fake guerrilla marketing.  Like, wow, the people are rising up.  Oh, they just can't get enough of 92.3 Now.  Look what they're doing.  You took on Z100, and I believe Z100 kicked the shit out of them so far, right?  So far, Z100 has remained in the lead, yes.  They want to come across like, wow, I listened to the station.  I was so impressed and loved it so much.  I'm going to spray-paint a banner.  Yeah, exactly correct.  Hang it up just so other people can enjoy it as much as me.  Yeah.  Some kids just did it.  They're crazy.  All right, so we got Bob Kelly on. 
[01:39:00]  What do we got?  No, my God.  That's Chunky.  Oh.  Chunky's in a little...  He's just lip-syncing to Party in the USA.  All right, look.  And playing the guitar over there is Buster, the young man who pirated into the radio station,  and they gave him the overnight time song.  Wow, really?  That's not a guitar.  Wait a minute.  Yes, that's a guitar hero.  All right, hold on.  Let's slow down a little bit.  The same company that fired...  I forgot their names.  Holy shit.  JV and Elvis.  JV and Elvis for doing an Asian joke allowed a guy that was pirating his own radio show 
[01:39:30]  to work for the company.  Yes, and thank God, after spending all his time pirating because he's so rebellious,  he has managed to stay in format.  Wow.  So good.  That's lucky.  Everybody works out a winner.  Wait, so he's still a, quote, pirate DJ?  I mean, it's still mentioned that, hey, we all know how he got here.  Oh.  You know what I mean?  Not the traditional way.  Who laughs at this?  Can you turn this up a little bit?  I just...  It's like...  Chunky's wearing a pink... 
[01:40:00]  He's just lip-syncing.  It's not even worth a girl's shirt.  It's terrible.  It's Chunky in the USA.  And look at his big fucking gut hanging out over his belt.  Well, yeah.  It's down like his...  Where his dick would be.  See, the great thing is, he...  Before we were on K-Rock, he was a DJ in Detroit.  I would assume he was wearing his Yankees hat in Detroit as well because he's been wearing  it since he came here.  Holy shit.  I almost threw my coffee at Sam.  What happened?  I almost threw my coffee at Sam. 
[01:40:30]  Why?  Because I just don't like what you're saying.  He's wearing his Yankees hat.  No, I know.  I would have had to apologize, but I just got so angry that I had to stop myself.  I realized I was throwing hot coffee at you.  Because you're mad at that station.  That's what's on right now.  What we should be on.  Yeah.  If we're going to be replaced, you want to sit at home and go, all right.  To New Yorkers.  By the way, Tic Tac and Lisa Page from the same Detroit radio station.  Of course.  Let's get into it.  Chunky gives away some tickets to Six Flags and gets in some good Slurpee jokes. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  You ready for this?  This is funny stuff.  And it's New York's new 92.3 Now.  This is Chunky.  What number is it?  This is the 7-Eleven right down the street from 92.3 Now.  It is.  Oh, my God.  I don't like it fast.  Slurpee?  I don't want a Slurpee.  I don't like Slurpees.  What about a couple passes to go to Six Flags Great Adventure Fright Fest? 
[01:41:30]  That would be fantastic.  But it comes with a Slurpee?  If I have to have a Slurpee, I'll have one then.  All right.  Congratulations.  You're a winner.  Oh, man.  Oh, you're hot.  First of all, there's no 7-Eleven down the street from 92.3.  We worked there.  Yeah, no, there never was.  None.  And why try the Slurpee thing a second time when it was obvious that the first time we said it?  Slurpee?  Slurpee?  Like, it was kind of an accent, but not enough to offend. 
[01:42:00]  Wait, is there a...  And is that his stomach growling?  What is stomach growling?  That noise.  I think that's a bed.  Oh, I thought it was Chunky's stomach growling.  Stomach growling.  Just something to keep the music going.  Oh.  Yeah.  And don't you get your own Slurpees in this day and age forever?  You do.  No one asks you.  You don't have to be, are you Slurpee?  No.  They'd never ask.  They would never ask.  Because the cup is even by the machine.  You know it's a Slurpee.  He's been Slurpee forever.  He's not looking at it going, what's that?  Slurpee!  The cashier has zero to do with the serving of it. 
[01:42:30]  And if you don't...  He never says Slurpee.  If you don't bring a Slurpee to the cash register, it's assumed that it's not something you're interested in.  Right.  And there's no...  Are there any 7-Elevens in Manhattan?  Could we look up...  Where's the one, Danny?  I gotta find it.  All right.  Let's look up the one 7-Eleven.  Right down the street from 92.3.  But if you guys notice...  Brooklyn.  Well, I've been living in New York off and off for 10 years.  I don't think I've ever seen a 7-Eleven.  Never seen a 7-Eleven.  Now that I think about it.  He messes with the caller a little bit.  No.  But he does let her win and keep her a bridge. 
[01:43:00]  When you guys picked up callers and said they were calling, you guys always made them feel a fool.  Maybe that is something you could learn from.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We could learn from Chunky.  I think so.  Why don't we go right into the next one?  And Chunky starts the phone topic that he will spend the next hour on.  Well, it's commercial-free Mondays.  What?  That's right.  It's a commercial-free Monday.  That's the thing.  Monday's no commercials.  So Chunky doesn't have to worry about commercials.  He can get in some more talk time. 
[01:43:30]  And so every other song, he'll pop in for his 20 seconds of talk time.  With the most annoying bed underneath, I'm sure.  Or he'll try to fit in a quick joke between the outro and the intro, making sure to hit the two posts.  Look, we had to talk over beds back in the day, back in the day, and we weren't happy about it.  Because we told Bruce Mamon, we're like, look, it's distracting, and it basically means you have nothing good to say if you're competing with a music bed.  That's so they could say, we only stopped the rock twice an hour. 
[01:44:00]  See, that's what they told us.  That was like the big thing.  We only stopped the rock twice an hour.  But me and Opie would just stop the rock whenever the fuck we please and start talking.  So they're like, well, you're stopping the rock.  And then we'd be like, no.  Us talking is rocking.  Yeah, we're rocking.  We're rocking with the talk.  It's a loose definition of the word rock.  Didn't you ever worry that the audience would stop listening because there was no music playing under you? 
[01:44:30]  Well, apparently it was the exact opposite of that.  Our ratings were twice as big than any other show on that fucking station.  Yeah.  Really?  So maybe they should have followed our lead.  Can I tell you that fucking, the way they talk about commercial radio on the New York radio message board like it's a lost art.  Oh, God.  Let me tell you something, NYRMB, whatever the fuck you are, radio message, regular radio is shit.  Yeah.  This platform you worship is fucking terrible.  It's not an art form. 
[01:45:00]  It's fucking awful.  It's dated, old, not new.  It's dated, fake, and corny crap.  What's some of the topics on the New York radio?  Where's the good old days radio?  There's a Hank Spann memorial.  All right.  I guess Hank Spann, I don't know who he is.  Scott Shannon's announcements for Sean Hannity.  That's very important.  WQXR, a few weeks of listening to 105.9.  That could be the worst message board ever.  W-B-G-O-S-2 broadcast from four times square. 
[01:45:30]  It's been a big drop-off of this message board.  No one fucking goes there anymore.  Yeah.  Awful.  All right.  Back to Chunky.  He's got his phone topic about to start.  Big Soupy sales R.I.P.  I'm sure a lot of people...  That's been there for weeks.  There's Soupy memories.  And with the Chunky thing, you got to keep in mind that Chunky, he does a topic.  He's only got one topic for the entire hour.  Wow.  So he doesn't have that.  You know, he could think of a great topic, which is what he does.  Oh, okay.  Some maybe you haven't heard before. 
[01:46:00]  Okay.  It's the new 92.3.  Now, this is Chunky.  Right now, this is what I want you to do.  I need three words that describe your ex-boyfriend.  Think about it and deliver.  Three best words that describe your ex-boyfriend.  888-923-0923 or text 69923.  I hit it.  He got it.  You see him hit the post?  You see that?  Damn.  That takes talent.  He probably records it, you know. 
[01:46:30]  I hope his ex-girlfriend calls in and says, fat fucking pig.  And then hangs up.  Wow, that's a good topic.  Yeah.  So what?  You take like, you know, maybe one, two calls on that?  No, no, no.  For the, actually, for the full hour.  That would be the...  Oh, that's an hour's worth of entertainment.  That would be the top of the hour.  And then between songs every now and then, it'll either be a sweeper.  Or Chunky coming in with a phone call.  Now, wait a minute.  How is it that Chunky knows that right between the songs that he's going to plunk a phone down and it's going to be good and fit in between the songs? 
[01:47:00]  Well, that's the thing.  You got to...  That's why it's so important.  That's why it's a lost art.  It's not recorded?  You got to have ESP.  No, I wouldn't.  You got to have ESP.  Yeah, you got to know that the person on the phone is going to be talking about this.  Yeah, you just got to know that it's going to fit in perfectly.  And it's going to hit the post.  Yeah, you just got to know that.  Yeah, I mean, usually, it's just like, you know, you lead them to tell a great joke right before the music hits.  Yeah. 
[01:47:30]  Well, let's see how it works.  Yeah.  Here we go.  Three words that describe your ex-boyfriend.  Okay, ready?  Rather kill myself.  Dude!  Dude, I look so big.  He is from the Rocco mold.  It's Rocco!  He is from the Rocco mold, this guy.  Literally.  Huge.  Dude!  Get back in the kitchen, Wang! 
[01:48:00]  Dude!  Sorry, that's way too inside, but it's the same fucking voice.  Radio is awful.  Three words that describe your ex-boyfriend.  Okay, ready?  Rather kill myself.  That's the answer that my ex would give if you said, would you want to see Chunky naked again?  Rather kill myself.  That's all right, baby.  I'd want to see you naked.  Oh, stop it. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah, I'm up at Brooklyn.  Why are you talking right up to the music?  Up to the lyrics?  Why are you doing that?  It's the only time he gets.  Yeah, that's what the audience likes to hear.  He has to shine during that time.  Radio's formula, I cannot get enough of how horrible.  You don't like the formula?  Dude, it makes me angry.  It is so fucking bad.  They've been figuring out the formula for decades.  I'm so glad that fucking overrated, fucking free piece of shit medium is going down the 
[01:49:00]  toilet.  Nobody's enjoying it anymore.  Except give me the traffic, shitheads.  Why?  They talk right up to the vocals.  It's beautiful.  Yeah.  God, it drives me nuts.  And then you get Jay-Z doing the Billy Joel song, New York State of Mind.  It's perfect.  It's the Empire State of Mind, and it's not a Billy Joel song.  But it's like one of those things.  You get the big laugh, and then, oh, I love this song.  So it's just such a great...  How could you argue with the formula, Jimmy?  God damn.  It's so built on keeping your ass cheeks open so you can get fucking...  Just get fucked with fucking advertisement after advertisement on Tuesdays. 
[01:49:30]  It's commercial-free Monday.  Yeah, but boy, they'd make up for it on Tuesday, I bet.  Yeah.  Tuesdays just commercial.  Music-free Tuesdays.  As we move on, our old station, which is called 92.3 Now, it's Chunky.  This is Jocktober.  Yes.  Sam writes, Chunky takes another call, ends with a punchline that I'm still trying to  figure out.  I think it's just over my head.  All right.  We'll find out.  The new 92.3 Now, this is Chunky.  Give me three words that describe your ex-boyfriend.  He is married, lying, and cheating. 
[01:50:00]  Dude, I can't even get one girlfriend, and this guy has a wife and a girl on the side that  he cheats on.  Yeah, it was four of us, and we all know about each other.  Well, I didn't know.  I found out at the last minute.  Who are you dating?  Chris Brown?  Oh, no.  He didn't mean it, miss.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I'm not.  I, no. 
[01:50:30]  Literal lady.  Well, I mean, in all fairness to her, she didn't know it was a joke.  No.  Well, because it didn't make sense in the context of a joke.  Chris Brown wasn't known for dating multiple women.  Right.  He was known for hitting one.  One.  Or one woman.  Like, he was just dating one woman, and he hit her.  What does that mean?  It had literally nothing to do with Chris Brown.  Oh, Chunky.  I mean, maybe Chunky knows something we don't.  Yeah, maybe.  Is he even in New York?  Some people say he's not even in New York.  It's voice track from Michigan.  What?  No, no, no.  He's, I mean. 
[01:51:00]  He's gotta be.  I heard, remember he walked up the stairs.  So.  The fake stairs.  Plus, he knows about the 7-Eleven right by the studio.  Oh, that's right.  I wonder if it is voice track.  No?  No, actually, I think it's, I think he moved to New York.  I hope so.  That guy's good.  Oh, yeah.  Teddy makes a good point.  The argument with Rihanna started because of text messages that Chris Brown was getting.  Oh.  See, Sam?  Get the joke already.  Oh, I guess that's very, that's very funny, then.  What's wrong with you?  That's hilarious.  Still doesn't mean it's funny. 
[01:51:30]  Now that shit's hilarious.  Hilarious.  Chunky takes another call, makes another great ex-girlfriend joke.  The guy in the couch slips up and Chunky makes it funny by over-explaining things.  You remember the guy on the couch?  No, I don't.  What?  Chunky's sidekick, the guy on the couch.  That's his name?  They just call him the guy on the couch?  That's kind of the crazy casual.  There you go.  Shut up.  You have a real name, this dude.  Ugh.  All right, it's commercial-free Mondays on the noon 92.3 now. 
[01:52:00]  Give me three words that describe your ex.  Fat, bald, and small.  Guy on the couch, did you just put my ex-girlfriend through?  Nah, because you're not small.  Ugh.  I meant, I meant like weight.  You're fat.  Nah, dude, come on.  Dude, you're making me look like you've seen me naked.  Dude, you're awesome.  We gotta go.  And there's the music.  Guy on the couch should be, I wish it was Pesci from JFK. 
[01:52:30]  Bald with his fucking wig.  Yeah, just laying there dead.  I got cancer and a funny bone.  I've had it for years.  For years.  Jesus.  Guy on the couch.  Oh, how much does he suck?  Oh, God.  They should light that couch on fire with him on and throw it out the window.  It really is awful.  Oh, good.  Couch of no laughs.  I wish it was Pesci and JFK.  What were they trying to get done there?  I don't understand. 
[01:53:00]  Well, it was like, because, you know, the girl said fat, bald, and small.  And Chunky had the good ex-girlfriend thing.  You know, what's this, my ex-girlfriend?  What's she talking about me?  He used a few ex-girlfriend things with him being naked.  Yeah, very funny.  It's good stuff.  But when she said small, it sounded like she was referring to genitalia, because she had  said fat before.  But guy on the couch thought she meant small as in the size.  And so guy on the couch said, you're not small.  And Chunky pointed out that that makes it sound like the guy on the couch has seen Chunky nude. 
[01:53:30]  But the thing was that when Chunky was going, dude, oh, I thought he was scolding the guy  for an awful joke.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  I actually liked that.  And then I realized that was just a...  Wow.  Okay, finally.  Corny homophobia.  We got it.  We're going to cut Jack-tober short today, because we've got to get ready for the paranormal  activity, people.  Well, finally, Chunky takes the last call and another punchline that makes no sense.  That's correct. 
[01:54:00]  Commercial-free Mondays are on.  The new Netty 2-3 now.  This is Chunky.  Give me three words that describe your ex-boyfriend.  Three of them.  Hey, Chunky, I can give you three words.  Yes, go ahead.  Stupid, cheater, and a loser.  He was cheating on me.  He ended up proposing to the girl that he cheated on me with.  This guy's got two problems.  Number one, he's way too horny.  And number two, he probably has chlamydia. 
[01:54:30]  What?  I nigh.  I nigh.  What is he talking about?  I don't know what he's talking about.  And he didn't even hit the post that time.  What, every guy that cheats has chlamydia, I guess?  I guess so.  Because he cheated on her.  What are you talking about?  Can I tell you, there's nothing worse.  We got kicked out for this shit.  Than a guy trying to be funny who is just terrible.  He's horrid. 
[01:55:00]  He's not a witty man.  No.  Did you hear what he said about his ex-girlfriend calling in?  What did he say?  He said because the girl called in and said something negative about her ex-boyfriend.  And so he goes, what's that, my ex-girlfriend?  Wouldn't he recognize her voice?  I mean, I guess he would before.  Yeah, he would think.  Unless it was a short-lived relationship or something like that.  Yeah, I guess he wouldn't.  Chunky is completely devoid of humor.  The three words his ex-girlfriend should have said about him was, shortened lifespan because 
[01:55:30]  of his late heart attack candidate.  Drop dead soon.  Very clogged arteries.  Creaky floorboards.  Broken toilet seat.  Let's do this all day.  Oh my God.  We got kicked out for this.  So, I mean, you know.  How do we sleep at night?  Listen to his show.  What the fuck are they thinking at that company? 
[01:56:00]  When you're beat, you're beat, you know?  Sometimes you just gotta admit defeat.  Right, boy.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  That's terrible.  And well, don't forget, he's got the lead in of Tic Tac and the Freak Show.  Well, thank God.  So, I mean.  I wish we had that lead in.  Exactly.  Hire a freak show, will ya?  I will.  Hey, can we, uh.  It's Rocco.  It's so Rocco.  Can we take a break?  Because we got the paranormal activity, I'm sure, walking down the hall at this point.  Katie and Micah. 
[01:56:30]  Micah.  I think.  Micah or Micah?  I think Micah.  That's a weird way to spell Micah.  Well, I didn't spell it.  It looks like Micah.  Um.  Is that a guy or a girl?  It's a guy.  Okay.  And Katie's a girl?  That's true.  Is she hot?  That's correct.  She's hot?  Yeah, she's gorgeous.  Can we see her panties?  I don't know.  You'd have to ask her.  Try to document it.  I believe some spirit is the following case since she was a young girl. 
[01:57:00]  Yes.  It's all over the news.  This fucking movie was made for $15,000.  That's insane.  Really?  No way.  It's already made over $62 million.  $15,000.  To make it?  Yeah.  Fuck.  I'm going crazy.  Why hasn't that been on the news?  I don't know.  I will have to ask him about that.  I guess they're keeping that on the QT.  I don't know.  I'm not hearing much about it.  But I did some research and found that.  Right.  In the film, Katie and Miss Seha. 
[01:57:30]  Mika.  Mika.  Play Katie and Miss Seha.  Mika.  Mika.  A couple who live together and try to document if they believe it's some sort of spirit that  has been following Katie since she was a young girl.  That's exhausting.  I mean, it's a good movie.  Who's Oren Pelley?  He would be the man who wrote it.  Reportedly did a huge amount of research and prepped his own house so that he could film  the movie in it.  He filmed it in his own house.  Now he's scared to live there, I bet. 
[01:58:00]  I don't know if there's actual ghosts.  But what I was reading was he put in a new staircase, he bought a giant TV, so he ended  up with a nice house after this movie.  Most of the script improv'd.  Yeah, that's right.  Entire film shot in seven days.  Jesus.  A week.  A week.  Day and night, of course.  You're trying to tell me we can make close to $100 million for a week's worth if we just  have a good concept.  Yeah, you can find 15 grand.  I don't know if we can find 15 grand.  That's great, but that kind of chicken feed. 
[01:58:30]  That's kind of tough.  Spielberg saw it, loved it.  Helped to greenlight it through Paramount.  Original plan was to remake it.  That's right.  But the test audience was terrified by the original, so they decided to keep and just  change the ending.  That's what I want to know, what the real ending was then.  It's on YouTube.  It is on YouTube.  Thank you.  The ending from 2007.  Yes.  Many compare it to the Blair Witch Project.  It's documentary-style shooting, which means shaky cam.  Which means...  Fez will probably throw up seeing it, because he can't see shaky more. 
[01:59:00]  This fucking movie looks like it blows.  What are you talking about?  What are we talking about?  No, this movie is actually...  It's got like 86% on Rotten Tomatoes.  This movie looks like it.  Sucks.  When are they coming in?  They're actually probably here now.  They may even be listening to this broadcast.  Katie, your movie sucks.  Come on in.  Let's talk.  O.B. is just being silly.  You know how O.B. is.  Do you think they're listening right now?  Is this the original ending?  Let me see the original ending.  Well, it's getting spoiled.  I don't care.  All right.  Like I give a shit. 
[01:59:30]  I ain't watching this horseshit of a movie.  Okay.  Well, you should check it out.  I saw it, and it was a great movie.  I was very frightened.  But this isn't even the ending.  When are these overrated actors coming in here saying that?  Oh, okay.  They're here now.  They are.  They are.  They're not listening, though, right?  They probably are.  Probably in the office.  All right.  He runs out of the bed.  No, don't say the ending on the air.  He's yelling for Kate.  This doesn't seem like a good thing to do.  Why?  Because it's not the real ending.  But there's still, you know.  The ending's six minutes long.  Now what do we do?  We stare at the bed for five minutes before the ending? 
[02:00:00]  Something scary's going to come out.  You know what we could do?  Maybe watch the ending while a commercial is on.  Maybe.  During the break.  All right.  Look.  We're watching just an empty bed.  I fast-forwarded.  What happens?  I'm not going to tell you.  I actually am not going to tell the ending of the movie on the air.  This isn't the ending of the movie.  It's the other ending of the movie.  This is the ending they didn't use.  It's the ending Spielberg didn't think was good enough.  But there are elements of this ending.  Is it the same ending?  He just, like, pumped it up a bit?  No, it's a very different ending.  It's still looking at a bed by itself. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, there's something coming.  Oh, my God.  This is scary.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  I remember from the theater.  It's very scary.  What?  How do you remember from the theater this isn't the ending?  I told you there's elements from this ending in the theater.  What was on our shirt?  Well, I'm not going to say that because that would be a giant spoiler.  Well, just tell us.  Did you say the Chunky Show?  Yes, it was a Chunky Show 92.3 Now Chunky t-shirt.  All right, now she walked back into the room.  Well, you don't have to.  Wait, are those the guys right there?  Yeah, that's the guy.  Oh, hi.  We're watching you right now. 
[02:01:00]  A little bit.  We should have them in and have them explain the ending.  Where's Jimmy?  Why would they explain the ending?  Huh?  Jimmy's peeing.  You want that?  Yeah, we should start the interview, I'm thinking.  Of course we don't.  Because we only have until 9 or should we do a quick break?  We've been there for a long time, I guess.  What should we do there, Dan?  We don't have to break.  I thought you would just want to.  I thought you wanted to.  All right, let's get him in.  Yeah, let's do that.  Katie!  Come on in.  From the film Paranormal.  Katie Featherston.  Close.  It's not when I fucked it up. 
[02:01:30]  I guess you should sit right there and there.  Welcome to our spacious studios.  What do you mean?  Our studios are horrible.  What part of the name did I get wrong?  There's a T in it.  It's Featherston.  I don't have a T in front of me.  It's not on my pass either, so technically I'm not allowed to be here.  Oh, shit.  Snuck in.  And I don't even know how to say your name, sir.  I'm really sorry.  We tried many different ways.  Mika.  Mika.  Mika Sloat.  We were just watching the alternate ending or something.  Yeah, they are a comfy scenario. 
[02:02:00]  How'd you guys get a copy of that?  I don't know.  YouTube.  Everything's on there.  You can report them after you leave.  No, this is the original ending before Mr. Spielberg helped you out.  Yeah.  This is the ending from the 2007 version.  I haven't seen this since 2007.  Really?  Really?  2007?  It's been a while.  You guys filmed this a long time ago?  We filmed it in 2006.  Really?  So you don't even remember this movie.  So that's like...  I'm thinking...  I don't remember what I did three years ago.  Look at the stuff I did in 2006 and can't imagine sitting around and having to talk  about it.  It's like, yeah, I remember that. 
[02:02:30]  No, I don't.  I have no recollection.  Some things we do forget.  I do forget.  I'm like, wait, how many endings were there?  Yeah, there's a lot of stuff there.  Yeah.  How much did this movie...  How much did it cost to make this movie?  Like a 11-ish grand.  Yeah, a little less.  11.  Your own cash?  Yeah.  My Visa card.  You've got to pony up that money yourself.  No, Oren, actually most of the money went either to renovating the director's house  or buying the camera.  What was it filmed on? 
[02:03:00]  HD.  I don't know.  It wasn't filmed?  No.  It was digital.  All digital, yeah.  HD flip?  It's nice and cheap.  I like that.  It was filmed with an HD flip?  It was done on an iPhone.  Yeah, exactly.  A little iPhone video?  That'd be awesome.  We did a photo shoot yesterday that had more equipment and a bigger crew than our entire  film.  Really?  Yeah, about five times the amount.  Now, you guys obviously didn't expect this to be a massive hit.  It's already made $62 million, so I'm assuming that it's got to suck for you guys because  I don't think you're getting paid for this. 
[02:03:30]  No, is it true?  We're not getting hung out in the cold.  Oh, really?  But is someone doing the right thing and going, oh, wow, we got a hit.  We got to take care of the actors that were in this movie?  Because I'm sure you didn't sign some big con...  Well, it's something people want to know.  Well, you know, Spielberg...  Didn't Spielberg buy it for $350?  We heard that it was cost like a short period of time that Spielberg bought it for $350.  How much?  $3.50, by the way.  It's amazing.  But he didn't...  No, no, no.  $350.  Well, everything's cheap.  Well, they made it for, I think, around $15, and then Steven Spielberg bought it for 
[02:04:00]  $350,000?  That's true.  I'm not supposed to give out specific numbers, but...  Ah.  Sure.  Yeah.  That's what we heard.  So Spielberg is making all the money off the guy's film.  Unless he gave them points on the back.  I think we should mislead people.  No, yeah, yeah.  You guys are pretty on track.  Well, if...  Oh, man, you're frustrated.  I can see it in their faces.  Everyone else is making money, and you're the freaking stars in the film.  No, no, no.  We're good.  When Oren originally got us into the project, he said he wanted us to be a... 
[02:04:30]  What's that?  Oh.  I thought someone was like, who's the one?  I'm going to watch the original ending.  Oh, and she's down.  I didn't see it.  Is that you?  That was me.  Don't say it.  I'm not looking, because I don't want to see the original.  I'm going to watch the movie.  This is not the ending that's in it.  But it's probably the same ending.  They just jazzed it up.  It's similar.  This is on YouTube.  This is crazy.  They jazzed it up.  He got together with Lucas and put the Ewoks in it.  Right.  I think it's how they digitally removed any guns from it. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, what a...  So when did you guys realize that something was happening like this, this wasn't just going  to be like this tiny independent film?  When did you get a phone call that goes, hey, Spielberg liked it?  Well, we did get a phone call, but everything happened so slowly and over time.  For literally years.  Yeah.  So there was never one moment where we were like, oh, this is it.  There were many moments where we were like, oh, this could be it.  No, it's not.  And then that would happen lots of times.  And there would be up and down.  And, oh, we have a deal.  Oh, it's a remake deal.  Oh, tough for us. 
[02:05:30]  I think after Scream Fest is when we actually realized we had something, because we hadn't  even seen the movie yet.  And we got in there and saw the crowd reacting.  And we really get into it with them.  And after that, I think we all came out of the screen.  If this works out, it's going to be good.  This would be awesome.  When you thought it was a remake deal, you were like, there's no way he's casting us.  Well, I don't know why they would have.  Starring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.  Yeah.  Megan Fox.  Yeah.  They would have thrown you guys out. 
[02:06:00]  That would have sucked.  They would have ruined it, though.  Yes.  Because you need, like, you know.  You need, like, you guys.  Because you're kind of like, you know, it's believable because you're regular people.  You're regular people.  Yeah.  That's what we're going for.  You can take out of it by going, oh, I've seen, you know, a blockbuster John Woo movie.  And that guy's supposed to be pulling off, you know, a regular guy.  And it's one of those movies that you, I mean, what would you do?  Put more CGI in it?  Or just make it worse?  It would be more than, what did it cost?  It would be more than.  11 grand. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, something like that.  It would be more than that.  In a week.  And it took a week to film.  Got to give credit to Paramount, though, for actually giving us a shot.  Thank God's not Lionsgate.  Yeah, D-Boy doesn't like that.  D-Boy doesn't like Lionsgate.  Don't even mention Lionsgate while you're in the studio, please.  That could cause a major problem.  You almost never hear stories like this.  No, of course not.  It's like, it's always, people do a film and it just goes nowhere.  It's just luck.  I mean, I don't mean that it's not a good movie, but the right person sees it.  People are fascinated. 
[02:07:00]  With scary movies.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, but there's a million bad, scary movies.  Jimmy's making a pretty good point.  The guy makes the film and then what happens?  How do you get it in front of Steven Spielberg?  It's got to take a little, you know, a few detours before it gets to Spielberg.  From the beginning, I think we just all, it was all word of mouth.  Even like the producers that signed on, you know, saw it from the Screenplay screening and just even the studio executives at DreamWorks, you know, believing in the movie and to the whole demanded thing.  I mean, that was amazing. 
[02:07:30]  We had a million demands.  I mean, when Paramount came out with that A Million Demanded thing, it made me kind of nervous.  I was like, I don't know.  Well, they said, go ahead.  All the fans, honestly, Paramount didn't know what the demand was for the movie, what the fans wanted.  And they said, well, you know, if you guys want to see the movie, we'll let you see the movie.  But you've got to tell us.  And we got this whole Demand It website, which is usually used for bands.  I'm sure you guys heard about it.  And we decided to do it for the movie. 
[02:08:00]  And we got a million demands in something like four days, which is unbelievable.  So, I mean, first of all, a big thank you to Paramount for understanding the movie and how it needed to be marketed, you know, virally and not with the big, giant billboards, which would have been cool to look at and take a picture under, but wouldn't have really worked for the movie.  But also to every single person that, I mean, demanded it and who, you know, we've had like a core group of fans for years.  And really hardcore, hardcore horror fans, you know, who like, you know, waited years to see it and never forgot about it. 
[02:08:30]  Now, now they're writing on message boards, how you're sell out.  I was watching that.  I saw that years ago.  You're selling out now.  Corporation mad.  They're actually, they're actually, I think, thankful that it's, wow, all totally on YouTube.  That's so crazy.  Yeah, yeah.  You better call.  You better call.  Have that taken off immediately.  Call Mr. YouTube.  That's his official name.  I like that.  But seriously, I mean, I'm so thankful for everybody. 
[02:09:00]  Are you guys, now you guys personally met with Spielberg, both of you?  Not yet.  Oh, boy.  That's the least he could do.  At least he could do.  At least the picture.  It's me with the actors that just made you a lot of money.  Just hearing, just knowing that he saw the film and that he liked it enough to, to, to  let me tell you something.  Let me tell you something.  Right here in Manhattan, there's a place called Madame Tussauds Wax Museum.  There's a Spielberg that is leaning against a director's chair and you get to sit in the  director's chair and it looks like you're taking a picture with Spielberg. 
[02:09:30]  I highly suggest you go over there and do that because you're never meeting Spielberg.  Why wouldn't Spielberg call these guys?  It's terrible.  Why wouldn't he?  They should go over and, you want to get some press?  Kick that wax figure over and really cause a ruckus in the wax museum.  Screw that.  Take a blowtorch to it.  A ruckus.  Yeah.  What do you think, what is it about the movie that really kind of grabbed people?  I think it's a, you know, the thing is that a lot of scary movies these days are all  about the blood and the gore and the violence. 
[02:10:00]  Shock value.  Yeah.  And this movie really is, is kind of digs in and grabs onto that fear that you have,  you know, from a kid of, you know, worrying about what's in the dark.  See, that's always scared me.  I don't, I could give a crap about slasher movies and blood and guts and things like that,  but if you get somebody twisting the wrong way or moving in that fast motion or shaking,  I'm scared.  I'm scared out of my mind.  His idea of a horror movie is jungle fever.  You're an asshole. 
[02:10:30]  What's the scariest movie you ever saw before you do this?  Like, what would you say is your ideal horror film?  The scariest movie I've ever seen prior to ours is probably The Exorcist.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, great.  That's right up there.  What did you think of, like, The Ring?  I didn't see The Ring.  Oh, my God.  What's wrong with you?  It was so scary.  I talked to my girlfriend in the cab last night.  I'm like, The Ring scared me.  And she went, you're a pussy.  She thought it was awful.  No, because it was the way that, that girl moved and everything.  It scared me, too.  It terrified me.  Terrified me. 
[02:11:00]  And, you know, just judging from what I've seen of paranormal activity,  it's, there's some of that jump out at you crap, and I don't like things like that.  If I can't shoot it, I'm afraid of it.  Yeah, you definitely can't shoot this thing, whatever it is, that's stalking us in the movie.  Well, what is it?  I mean, well, it's some sort of paranormal activity.  Can't be a bad question.  Wouldn't it be funny if they just blurted it out by accident?  It's our neighbor, Fred.  Steven Spielberg. 
[02:11:30]  Hey, do you guys like the new ending?  Because, I mean, the movie's been around for a while,  so, I mean, some of the ones, some of the people that saw the original,  they were a little upset with the new ending,  because they wanted it to be how it was.  Yeah, I can understand that,  because the difference between the new ending and the old ending,  the old ending kind of fits the vibe of the film,  in that it's really low-tech, and it's low-key,  and it doesn't really have any big jump scare or anything like that.  But I think the new ending plays better,  and personally, I like the new ending the best,  because it's just a really good punch at the end. 
[02:12:00]  But for sure, all the fans that do like the old ending, I mean...  Sorry, we're distracted, and Katie noticed, too.  We weren't sure if Jim Norton was having a stroke  or trying not to hear the answer to the question.  I was trying not to hear the ending.  We weren't sure at first.  I thought you were having a stroke.  I thought your brain just, like, hit you,  and you were so angry or something like,  how dare these people be here?  You kind of bothered her.  She really started freaking out.  I was doing this.  No, no, I was holding my ears,  and I was just kind of breathing to myself,  because I didn't want to make noise,  but in case they said something that was indicative of the old ending... 
[02:12:30]  No, no, they didn't...  I didn't want to hear the one.  They didn't give me anything away, but I want to see it.  I want to translate the answer.  They don't want to piss off Steven Spielberg,  so they have to say they like the new ending of the old ending.  That's exactly what he said.  But I want to see the movie and then see the original.  Oh, okay, I'm sorry.  I just didn't want to blow it.  You know what?  I know the old ending is something that we worked on and we liked,  but it didn't have the same kind of effect on the audience that the new one has.  You two are dead the whole movie, right? 
[02:13:00]  Absolutely.  We start off dead, but then we are reborn by the end.  It's the seventh week.  Yes.  I'm going to go to the phones.  A lot of people have seen the movie, obviously.  Tom in Indiana.  Tom, we got a couple of the actors from Paranormal Activity.  What's up?  Hey, hi.  Listen, I was just calling to say that I'm still pissed off.  I've seen this movie about ten days ago, and I still can't sleep.  Every time I wake up in the middle of the night,  I'm thinking of Katie standing there looking, staring for hours. 
[02:13:30]  Spoiler alert.  Yeah, hang up on him if he's spoiling.  You've got to keep your trigger finger on the call.  All right, we're trying not to spoil these days.  We used to ruin every single movie that comes out.  It was fun.  And then we realized we lost all our audience, so we had to stop doing that.  The best thing about this movie, the best way to go into it, too,  is knowing as little as possible about what's going to happen.  Sure.  Hey, are you guys getting work now?  We're definitely getting a lot of opportunities.  A lot of looks?  Yeah.  A lot of auditions and scripts and whatnot. 
[02:14:00]  Scripts and meetings and people.  That's got to be exciting.  It's amazing.  The last couple of weeks have been...  Are you guys just friends with the director or your actors?  You know what I mean?  Or did he just kind of look at you two and go, hey, I need your help?  No.  Or is this something you guys are into, acting and all?  It was just a...  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Okay.  We've been...  We were both in L.A.  I mean, you know, I went to college and then came out to L.A. and waited tables and auditioned  like every other...  Right.  So you were casted in this as a movie-wise for a friend.  Yeah.  Oh, cool.  I think there was about 100, 150 people for each part that auditioned. 
[02:14:30]  Wow.  Jesus Christ.  Really?  Yeah.  We walked in the room and...  I really thought you were just friends with the guy.  No.  It just worked out for everybody.  It was like a Kevin Smith kind of a thing.  Hey, let's just cast my friends.  That's the way some of us get parts.  Yeah, you ass.  So you just kind of auditioned for this thing and it's amazing.  Fucking a couple years later, nothing happens.  It's like, yeah, it's kind of a cult following and now it's one of the biggest films in the  country.  That's great.  It is the biggest film in the country.  I can't believe that.  Yeah.  Are you going to be recognized everywhere?  Yeah.  More so in New York, actually. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  I haven't been anywhere but either in a car or in a place like this.  So I haven't...  Yeah, they just...  Oh, you're a prima donna?  No.  Oh, nice.  We've just been busy.  Like screw walking the streets with the people.  We carry Caligula.  I did walk to the pharmacy last night.  I wasn't recognized.  You weren't recognized?  Or no one said anything.  Why'd you go to the pharmacy?  Oh, I needed a bottle of water because, truthfully, I didn't...  What are you hoping for Valtrex?  Yeah.  Well, normally that's prescription.  You have to...  I needed a first response. 
[02:15:30]  I was hoping we just...  Jesus Christ.  It was for something horrendous.  No, truthfully, I went...  Truthfully, this is funny.  I got an itchy asshole and I needed some cream.  I went because I didn't know that they were...  I knew they were paying for our hotel, but I didn't know that they were paying for normal  things.  And the bottled water in the hotel room is like $49.  Oh, my God.  I was like, screw that.  So I went to the pharmacy and bought a bottle of water for like two bucks. 
[02:16:00]  That's somebody who's not gotten jaded yet.  I know.  Somebody who doesn't...  Yeah.  Doesn't crack that minibar open and go, I don't give a shit.  Yeah.  Eight bucks for water?  Sounds like a deal.  I'm thirsty now.  I drank two of them.  See?  And we've lost them.  I've lost you to the dark side.  Yeah.  What's the coolest thing that's happened to you besides some fame that's come with it?  What's the coolest thing that you've had happen that made you realize, like, wow,  man, this is really going to be a career changer?  A career changer? 
[02:16:30]  The movie wasn't good enough to be...  I know.  Like, the movie, just getting into theaters is a career changer.  Was that when they said going to theaters?  Yeah, that was it.  I haven't...  Truthfully, I haven't wrapped my head around...  I mean, we're like hanging out right now.  Obviously.  Going to the store for water.  But I don't feel...  I don't feel any different.  It's just people around us are different.  Yeah.  Wait till...  Oh, it's so cool when you just...  Everyone is, like, beneath you and everything.  And you, like, buy cool things and make people jealous. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, it's great.  Wait till your family asks you for money.  That's fun, too.  Oh, wait till your family starts asking for cash.  That's a great thing.  And then people you don't even know ask you for things.  Oh, wait till fans knock on your door at your house in the middle of the night and go,  Hi, I'm just here to hang out.  And you know the fans that build you up and making you, like, feel so special?  Yeah, yeah.  Wait for those same people to beat the shit out of you and knock you down.  On a few levels.  The next project you do?  Oh, yeah.  Don't hate it.  You know, it was so good and paranormal, but they suck in this. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, it's just great.  Fans are wonderful.  Oh.  They're looking down.  Oh, sorry.  They're just floating their big day.  Spenting a little there.  I didn't realize I'd gotten off on a tangent.  Oh, we just vocalized that?  Oops.  We're y'all talking out loud.  I think we did.  Yeah, we did.  What TV do you got to ourselves?  Happened.  TV, we got...  We're doing the Today Show.  It's cool.  And some MTV and some...  Oh, Today Show will be fine.  Good in New York.  I hear that's so very scary. 
[02:18:00]  How did you...  Were you scared making the movie?  Yeah, that's exactly...  Okay.  Right, right.  Yeah, yeah, right.  Yeah, yeah, right.  Yeah.  That's what you're going to get.  It's going to be great.  I actually...  I'm such a fruit.  I wanted to ask if they were scared making the movie, but I didn't.  Go ahead.  Ask him.  Ask him, Jimmy.  Why are you scared?  Mikko, were you scared?  Katie is absolutely terrifying when she's looking at you three feet away from you, and she's  all possessed, and she's...  Oh, you got a real...  It's horrifying.  She got a wicked thousand-yard stare. 
[02:18:30]  It's...  Let me tell you a story.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  I love that he's giving me so many props here for being so scary, but I think we should  know the source of who's telling the story, because we, before we filmed this movie, we  got together, and we had to, like, we hung out, like, twice, once to take pictures so that  our house would look normal, like we lived in it, and then the other time, we went to  Halloween Horror Nights at Universal CityWalk in Hollywood.  She likes the story a little too much.  Because this is hysterical.  So, in the audition, we meet, and he's all, like, macho, and he's like, oh, I'm going  to protect my girlfriend.  Nobody's going to mess with my girlfriend, kind of thing. 
[02:19:00]  And, uh, so we go to this Halloween Horror Nights, this big, scary thing, and, uh, I'm  expecting him to be, like, macho and tough and whatnot, and we get in there, and he is  terrified.  He is leaping behind me and, like, thrusting me out to the...  I was just protecting you from the giant pigs with train sauce.  Well, you were not protecting me.  You were cowering.  It was reverse psychology.  Cowering behind me.  All right, so you're not a horror person.  You get scared very easily.  He gets scared very easily.  You get frightened.  That's probably one of the things, uh, that, uh, one of the reasons Orange cast me. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  Hey, I know we're running out of time, but there's, uh, there's someone on staff that's  a very good actor and plays Possessed real well.  Mm-hmm.  Would you like to see him?  I would.  Sure.  E-Rock.  Come on in here, E-Rock.  E-Rock, could you show him how you play Possessed?  Yeah.  That's right.  Make, like, you're Possessed.  Yeah.  Yes.  E-Rock's been in a couple of, uh, independent films.  He's being a little...  E-Rock, don't be shy.  It's opening.  Come on.  You do it all the time. 
[02:20:00]  Just because they're in the number one movie in the country.  You've got the stars of Paranormal Activity.  Grab a mic and show how you play Possessed.  Pretend you've been possessed by the demon of Boring.  All right, grab a mic.  Pretend.  This is E-Rock.  He does this very well.  His body is full of cholesterol.  The ghost.  He's possessed with cholesterol.  That's so not right.  I'm so excited for this.  Yeah.  All right, E-Rock.  That's great.  Because she does a great job in the movie, so, you know, let's see how he would play  Be Possessed.  We should work together in a duo-possessed film. 
[02:20:30]  You just might want to?  Yeah.  No, that's all right.  All right, here we go.  Wow, did I just get rejected?  Did he just shut me down?  He really did.  Why are you shutting down a big actress?  Turned you down.  Who do you think he was?  Spielberg?  Yeah.  Ah, see, because you never met him yet.  Oh, sorry.  See, that's got to hurt it.  $15,000.  What?  Okay.  Come on.  Just show her.  What are you, shy all of a sudden?  Be Possessed.  Be Possessed for Katie.  All of a sudden, you're Possessed.  There's some kind of evil in you.  I really want to hug you right now.  I feel so bad for you.  So do I with that.  What the hell was that? 
[02:21:00]  What was that?  No, that wasn't Possessed.  You want to turn the lights off?  You're a very scary Possessed.  It looks like a chicken having a seizure.  Oh, my God.  See?  What do you think, Katie?  Oh, mood lighting.  Oh, this is good.  What are you doing?  I'm possessed.  What are you doing?  That wasn't Possessed.  One, show me.  That's your Frankenstein.  He put his arms out straight and moved like he was doing the fucking robot dance in 1988.  That's not Possessed.  You didn't like his Possessed.  I know.  What do I can do?  I thought it showed a lot of potential.  Katie, did you like his Possessed?  I thought it showed a lot of potential.  All right, good. 
[02:21:30]  Good.  Not bad.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Yurok.  Thank you, Yurok.  That was wonderful.  That's going to be my favorite part of the day right now.  Is he man or ghost?  That's very spooky.  Wow.  Well, these guys have a busy day.  We've got to get them out of here.  You're very busy with your promotion.  That damn movie that only cost $15,000.  $15,000?  I haven't heard that yet.  Geez, how sick are you about that question?  You know, it's been asked a lot, but always new people, so it's...  Wow.  See?  Okay, she is a little different because normally if you weren't in a popular movie, you'd just 
[02:22:00]  go, I'm so sick of it.  I'm sick of when people ask.  But you're diplomatic.  Diplomacy is the first sign that you're getting better than everybody else.  I like that.  That's good.  That's good.  You're like, no, they're good.  They're good.  Meanwhile, they're like, oh, I'm so annoyed at hearing that.  So good.  You're being diplomatic.  Next thing you know, you're going to throw away those ramen noodles and start eating real  food.  And you're not going to go to a Dwayne Reed for water.  A mini bar beer.  $16.  Yeah. 
[02:22:30]  You indulge.  Feel good about yourself.  How do you say your name?  Mika.  Mika.  Is this your first movie?  Yeah, this is the first movie that went anywhere.  Jesus.  That went anywhere.  Cool.  And hopefully not to last.  Nothing in your past you're going to be embarrassed about when they dredge up, huh?  Uh, nothing that anyone's going to be able to find.  Nice.  Nice.  What the fuck?  Let's get Steven Spielberg to call these two.  How do we get them to call us?  Yeah, what are you talking about, Opie?  How do we get them to call?  We can't get the boss at this place to call us.  How do we get them to call?  Um...  Is he listening?  Mr. Spielberg?  Yeah, yeah.  Big fan.  He listens every day. 
[02:23:00]  Big fan.  With all the respect to my heart, I'd love to talk to you on the phone or meet you.  He doesn't even know me.  Steve, why don't you get...  That's got to suck.  God.  Come on.  What?  Help her out.  That's touching.  Well, it sucks.  I'm mad.  Steve.  I'm mad for them.  They said a sequel is rumored to already be in the works.  Yeah.  Are you guys going to be cast in the sequel?  Well...  Don't say anything because that's kind of a spoiler.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You don't say anything.  What do you mean?  It's not if it's a horror movie.  She can come back to life if she's dead.  I don't even know if she's dead, but it's a horror movie.  They can make anything happen. 
[02:23:30]  Paranormal activity.  I've seen people come back and lost.  She could be a ghost the whole fucking time.  Jeepers Creepers, even though he was dead.  They all come back and lost.  It's crazy.  All right.  Every episode, they're coming.  Okay.  What do you know about a sequel?  They're back.  They get paid.  Nothing yet?  I'm not the one.  Oh, they're out of those meetings.  Not good.  That's not a good sign.  We're not even getting the press breaks anymore.  They have cut us loose.  Oh, boy.  That's not good.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  We don't know anything about a sequel or a prequel or whatever.  Back in front of a Sony Handycam.  Any day of the week, I'd do it again. 
[02:24:00]  All right.  Let's get them out of here because they've got to go to the Today Show.  Know what a Panavision camera looks like from the front?  Wow.  It's astonishing.  I don't even know what that is.  Beta Max.  Beta.  My childhood's on beta.  Aw.  It's cute.  All right.  We learned a lot from these two.  You're very nice people.  Thanks.  I bet.  They're not totally screwed yet.  I hope you have the success that makes you jaded.  Thank you, I think. 
[02:24:30]  That's a compliment.  It's actually a compliment.  It's for luck and everything.  There's not much to say about it.  I mean, everybody knows about the movie.  It's like, how does something become like, it's just, it's in everybody's kind of conscious.  Like, how does it just happen where it becomes like one of these things that everybody talks about?  Like, I just heard about, I don't even remember how I heard about the movie.  But then all of a sudden people are like, yeah, you're going to go see Paranormal Activity?  Like, it had been around for years.  It's so weird how that shit happens.  I just heard nothing, by the way.  It was kind of a viral thing.  It was a guerrilla advertising kind of a thing.  Facebook.  Twitter.  Twitter.  I really like that.  Hey, everybody who's listening, follow me at Katie Diane. 
[02:25:00]  At Mika Slote.  Twitter.com.  They don't know how to spell that.  The thing is, look up, go to IMDB.  Look up Paranormal Activity.  You'll know how to spell their goddamn name.  I don't know how people don't do it.  Where do you spell it?  Look it up.  There's computers.  It's the future.  Why are we all yelling?  I'm angry.  I'm angry too.  I am.  I'm not really.  All right, let's get them out of here.  They got the big Today Show thing.  Don't say hi to the Today Show people.  They love us.  All right. 
[02:25:30]  Good luck with the movie.  It's made $61 million.  And only cost what?  How much?  $15,000.  Wow, are you kidding?  Let's talk about that for a while.  How great would it be if that was just a rumor and it really cost $38 million.  And they're losing money.  Or $75 million and they made nothing.  They lost money for the studio.  All right, their people have coats on.  We've got to get them out of here.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you.  All right, we're going to take a break.  We'll continue.  Hope you and Anthony.  The jokes continue as you listen to crappy commercials. 
[02:26:00]  I'm sorry for that.  We should go commercial-free Tuesday like Chunky does.  Or Monday.  It's Monday.  Get them hooked for the week.  I want to thank the Paranormal Activity people for coming in.  That wouldn't make $100 million, right?  $100 million?  I think it'll do $100 million.  Oh, shit.  Say.  Damn it.  Damn it.  Oh.  I'm trying to sing.  But it's just a musical clip. 
[02:26:30]  What we have in front of us is a list, Opie.  Well, you want to go over the Paranormal Activity interview?  I thought it was terrific.  Oh, you want to do a debriefing?  You want to debrief about it?  I think it sucks that they're making absolutely no money off this huge success of this film.  Yeah, no one's bullshitting us.  Because if you don't sign a fucking contract and people don't want to acknowledge that you're worth anything.  You know what?  They should do the right thing and turn around and give them a mil each.  They may have a back end, though.  Sometimes you sign these deals and they're like, yeah, yeah, we'll give you a little piece. 
[02:27:00]  You never know.  You know what, though?  Some guy making a movie for 15 Gs with a digital camera and in his own house is not going to have a contract made up with a back end.  He's probably just going to be like, hey, I'll give you a few bucks.  Here you go.  You never know.  That guy didn't even make money, Jimmy.  He probably made, what, $350,000 is the rumor.  He sold his life away.  You sell your movies to other people and production houses and whatnot. 
[02:27:30]  So he made about $350,000, I'm thinking, which, wow, that's a nice chunk of change for anyone.  But the problem is the movie's going to make well over $100 to $200 million.  That guy's got to be kicking his asshole.  Maybe, but you don't know.  Again, you never know.  They may have promised him something on the back end.  If it does well, guys.  No fucking way.  And might not have gotten that promotion.  I mean, there's not a guy involved with the original film that's going to make a million dollars.  That's a sin.  You're not getting the promotion machine behind you. 
[02:28:00]  You sell your movie and that's it.  I know a guy in Philly that sells his movies and some he does well.  But he's only making...  He's a child pornographer.  That's what I mean, though.  It's like the guy's probably kicking himself in the ass for not holding on to the movie and making it that much.  But then to get distribution and promotion, it costs...  He's in a club.  He's in a tough spot because the guy that made Paranormal Activity, he's got to take the money.  What else is he going to do?  Hold out for more money? 
[02:28:30]  That might never come.  There's a little story of a little actor that wrote a little movie and didn't sell it to the studios.  And that man was Sylvester Stallone.  The movie was Rocky.  Holy shit.  The movie was Rocky.  There's a gentleman that stuck to his guns and said,  No, I'm not changing things.  I'm acting in the movie.  I'm doing everything.  And if the big studios don't want it, I'll do it myself.  Hey, can we put out the bat signal for Kevin Smith? 
[02:29:00]  Could someone tweet him right now?  I was actually just thinking about him.  If we could get him on the phone for five minutes, he'll explain this whole thing.  I think the Paranormal Activity guy had no choice, sold the movie for about $350,000.  I wonder if he even gets all of that.  And that's it.  He's done.  He's out.  He's out.  But now with Clerks.  And then there's going to be an international distribution for this movie.  I don't think he gets any of that shit.  What do you think Kevin made for Clerks?  That's why I want to get him on the fucking phone.  $30 some odd grand, I think, Clerks cost him. 
[02:29:30]  Did he have to sell that movie to somebody else?  And did he have to sell it to Miramax or something?  He would know this shit.  I mean, he's got to be in the middle of tweeting.  I'll text him right now.  Are you?  Good.  Maybe he's out.  It's not TriStar, right?  It better not be Lionsgate.  Lionsgate.  I don't like TriStar.  You're not a fan of TriStar?  No.  What did they do to you?  I don't know.  What did fucking Lionsgate do to D-Boy?  That's a good point.  He's just crazy.  It has something to do with drinking. 
[02:30:00]  Good point.  I think when you drink a lot, you hate a movie company.  But maybe Kevin doesn't even want to tell us the inside workings of his Clerks movie.  No, he'd tell us.  Kevin's an honest motherfucker.  But he would probably at least tell us his feeling on the whole paranormal activity and  what they got.  And I were discussing the actors.  Now, they're promoting the movie like crazy.  They're going to be on the Today Show.  They were on our show.  They did some photo shoots and whatnot.  So, you've got to assume that they're doing the right thing and paying them for that,  for their time.  But it's nothing.  Do you think they're paying them for the promotion to go out and promote the movie? 
[02:30:30]  Knowing they probably didn't make any money on this?  Sure.  I don't know.  Still not enough to make them rich.  They get paid.  They probably get first class travel expenses.  And their expenses are taken care of.  They're treated really great probably for the first time in their careers.  But put it this way.  They're on Spielberg's radar.  If she's not sure if the hotel is being paid for and she's going down to the CVS to get  water instead of opening up the minibar. 
[02:31:00]  Biggest movie in the country and she's finding water.  If you had a percentage or you had a back-end deal and you saw this movie has made $61 million.  She's nervous enough where she's going to get cheaper water.  I'd be bathing in the tiny vodka bottles in the minibar.  Having them just refilling.  That's a great point.  She's still nervous about money.  She's nervous.  That means she didn't get a good deal.  Don't get nervous.  Maybe she just hasn't.  A lot of people are asking if she had nice boobs in person because I guess you get to 
[02:31:30]  see it at night.  Yeah, they were kind of hard to see though.  Because she had the button-up shirt.  They were ample.  Was it ample?  They were ample.  Was it ample?  I would call them ample.  Would you call them suckable?  Yes.  If they're ample, they're probably suckable.  I got a question for Jimmy.  Jimmy, how do you suck on a boob?  What's the right way to suck on a boob?  Jimmy?  I do it, like, I don't know if you've ever seen a lamb.  Turn around and look for inspiration.  Holy shit.  Should we ask her?  Hi.  Hi.  We're just talking about your boobs as you walk by. 
[02:32:00]  Hi.  Hi.  Here's what I do.  Hi.  I grab the breast with my hand like this.  She arches her back when she turns around that corner, you know, on purpose.  I know.  I'll palm a breast like this.  And she slapped her ass.  Yes, you're looking at your ass.  Stanley, stop.  Stanley fucking showed his ass, too.  I'll tell you what I do.  She works her body as she walks by the studio.  I grab a breast.  We know that.  And I squeeze it.  And when the breast meat comes up between my fingers like a squeeze ball.  Yeah.  I go like this.  I look across the back of my knuckles.  Yeah.  I don't think a girl would like that. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, here's what I'll do.  Yeah.  I'll have her hang her teeth over my mouth.  And this is any girl.  Yeah.  And then what she does, it's above my lip.  I slap her tit.  And when it goes back and forth, I just stick my tongue out and let the tit do the work.  I let the titty do the work.  Oh, shit.  You're a sexy man.  What would I do?  Mr. Norton.  Is I'll pick the girl up.  Yeah.  And I'll just, I'll pick her and then I'll move her up and down, up and down, up and  down while I have my mouth open. 
[02:33:00]  I'll make gobble noises while I suck her breast.  Girls like when you make turkey noises.  They love it.  They love it.  I'm glad I asked.  I'm glad I asked.  Yeah.  Hey, here we go.  So hopefully Kevin Smith will get our message and give us a quick couple minutes of it.  I sent him a good text.  A very valuable time.  Some insight.  So we're fighting it out with the guest bookers of this company, Sirius XM.  And, you know, they don't like when we bitch too much.  But then we bring cold, hard facts to our argument and our bitching. 
[02:33:30]  And then it's hard for them to argue back.  Certainly.  These are guests that we actually said yes to because they were offered to us somehow.  Yeah.  Steve goes, well, I'm going to give you some names and you guys decide if you want them  on the show or not.  Yeah.  This is what happens after the show.  Right.  While I'm trying to bolt out the door.  Right.  Steve asks us about guests.  And these are the ones we acknowledge because every once in a while he'll say like Al Pacino  or someone.  And we go, will you shut up?  We're not even answering that question.  Al Pacino is never coming on our fucking show. 
[02:34:00]  So these are the ones we acknowledge enough to think that maybe there's a possibility they  would actually do our show.  This list is really long.  These are the ones we said yes to.  Not one of these was on our show.  No.  So there is a major fucking problem with guest bookings.  And a lot of these people, not a lot, but a handful,  were on our show in the past.  Let's just say in the past.  A couple.  Who wants to do the list?  We can all do it.  Start with Cesar Millan. 
[02:34:30]  Cesar Millan was only doing TV.  Yeah.  Is he the dog whisperer?  Yes, but he's a really good guest.  I'm insulted now.  Screw him.  Jim Cramer, only coming in the afternoon.  Well, these were the excuses we got after we said yes, we'll have him on our show.  Just to explain further.  Iggy Pop, only coming in the afternoon.  Chris Rock, past.  That's his publicist.  I'm surprised.  But Chris Rock has done our show.  I'm keeping track of the people that have done our show.  I'm surprised about that.  That's the first one that has done our show.  Snoop Dogg's still working on it.  Really?  Yeah. 
[02:35:00]  Snoop Dogg has done our show in the past, by the way.  That's two.  P. Diddy, past.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  I don't know what we're going to do without a P. Diddy interview.  Sully from the plane, only doing TV and phoners in the afternoon.  His book took a beating as a result.  Can you say his real name, please?  Chesley Sullenberger.  Chesley.  Stephen King, past.  Do you want to talk to the morning mashup as they walk by?  No.  No.  Okay.  Go ahead.  Ricky Gervais has passed.  Let's be honest. 
[02:35:30]  He's done our show.  He was in the studio and did at least one phoner over the years.  In the studio once and a bunch of phoners.  He'll never do it again.  Boy, all these people that used to do our show don't do our show anymore.  What's the problem?  I would say the problem is you got rid of Roland, who was looking out for this fucking radio show.  That was a Roland special.  Right.  Roland and him, you know.  Roland writes me all the time.  He goes, you know, these people, why aren't they on your show?  I could get them on with a phone call.  One lousy phone call, they would be on your show.  And I believe Roland.  Right.  Blagojevich.  Blagojevich.  Blagojevich.  Yeah, Blagojevich. 
[02:36:00]  Came in the afternoon.  No, passed.  Did Stern, it said.  Oh, really?  Great.  Quentin Tarantino.  Another one that did our show in the past.  Afternoon.  I guess he did Ron and Fez.  Then did Stern the next day.  So he could have done our show.  Oh, okay.  Yes, he could have.  Bob Cass.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  What?  We might have been off that day.  Oh, Cap.  You know what?  We were off that Friday.  So maybe he could have.  It's their fault anyway.  Yeah.  Everything's their fault.  We don't work around yours.  Bobcat Goldthwait.  Passed.  Left town early.  So we wouldn't have to do our show.  Really? 
[02:36:30]  Juliette Lewis.  Passed.  What does it say?  No what?  No male-oriented talk shows.  What a fucking coddled idiot.  What does that mean?  Meaning she didn't want to do any male.  She just wanted the women because she didn't that's who was going to buy her product.  Oh, stop it.  She's pretty fucking cool, too.  That's disappointing.  I thought she could handle herself on our show.  Jimmy Buffett passed?  I would try to work Jonathan for that one.  Jimmy Buffett.  Jonathan's a good friend of him.  Tracy Morgan, I just see a question mark.  Yeah, I don't know what his deal is.  He, for some reason, doesn't like us anymore, I guess.  Doesn't like us anymore.  I had a nice conversation on the Kevin Smith movie set with him. 
[02:37:00]  It's not Tracy.  It's his publicist.  And he said he would come in to fucking promote his book.  Dude, nothing to do with Tracy.  That's his publicist.  Well, we got a major issue.  I'm up to five people that used to do our show and now not doing our show.  Hulk Hogan?  Uh-huh.  Publicist passed because they were angry with us.  Kevin Smith on the phone?  Oh, fucking Kevin.  All right.  That's why we love Kevin.  Kevin, let me start by saying, who is better than you?  Nobody.  Gretzky.  Gretzky.  Gretzky.  Okay.  We can accept that.  But we put out the bat signal for you and there you are. 
[02:37:30]  Thank you.  We just had the...  You know what?  Give it up to...  Let me give a shout-out to the people who hit me.  Okay.  Less than three, 13, and who else?  Chris, 98VF, and a dude named Wilcor.  I was just...  I hit my Twitter page and suddenly, boom, boom, boom, three people were like, oh, oh, and  I...  You didn't get my text?  I texted you.  Yeah, Jimmy texted you.  He doesn't carry that phone.  I get such weak phone service up at the house, so it's rare that I have a call. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah, you've got to go with his Twitter.  Like, I go down the hill from my house, and I get 16 text messages.  That's so weird.  You can't get cell service in a place called Hollywood.  I know.  Where a lot of dealing...  Wheeling and dealing is going on.  You got AT&T, Kevin?  I do.  There you go.  No, it doesn't matter.  I'm telling you.  Everyone has problems out there.  Because of all the hills and shit.  Aren't they opening it up soon?  I heard something like next year...  Oh, they always say that.  ...iPhone's not exclusive to AT&T.  I don't know.  But yeah, it seems to be a kind of weak signal here.  Now, Kevin, we just had the Paranormal Activity actors in, okay? 
[02:38:30]  The movie, as we all know, is a huge success.  Made 62 million so far.  And by the time this is done, safe to say a couple hundred million?  I would...  Yeah, easily.  Easily.  Okay.  I don't know what it does foreign, but it doesn't feel like it's petering out until it gets to  at least a hundred or more here, depending on how far the craze goes post-Halloween.  And it's a Halloween season where we're in the middle of here.  All right, so we got the actors in.  The movie was made... 
[02:39:00]  They're now saying $11,000.  Right.  They are...  They obviously...  We told them.  They're not making any money off this movie, right?  I mean, they'll get...  I don't...  I'm not really sure on the particulars of this.  Somebody was telling me that it's like...  It's a Paramount film, correct?  Yeah.  Well, the director, I don't remember his name, which sucks.  I should give him credit here.  But he sold the film to Paramount, I guess, for $350,000.  So that's it for him, right?  He's done? 
[02:39:30]  I mean, I doubt it.  I'm sure any agent worth their salt built into the dude's contract that, you know, he had bumps, at least bumps.  What they'll do is build in bumps for unlikely hits.  You know, like they'll say, when we hit $50 million, you get another $100,000.  When we hit $100 million, you get $1 million.  When we hit this, figuring it'll never reach those heights.  And, you know, then all of a sudden you see this. 
[02:40:00]  I mean, you think about...  This may be inside baseball, but like this will tell you a story about how movie financing and back-end deals can kind of blow up in your face.  Because on Good Will Hunting, Robin Williams had this killer back-end deal that, you know, said, like, if the movie made X amount of dollars, boom, he gets a huge bump.  And if the movie made this, he gets a huge bump.  Because you've got to remember, the dude took, like, nothing up front to be in that movie. 
[02:40:30]  Right.  And he was a huge coup for us in that movie.  So, you know, and his agent, rightfully so, built into his deal, like, okay, he's not taking much up front,  but, like, if this movie, in the unlikely event that this movie takes off, just covering our asses here,  we're going to make sure that at these certain bump levels, he's going to, Robin's going to be compensated.  And it was huge compensation, dude.  You're not talking like you get a $100,000 bump, which, again, that's huge, too.  We're talking way bigger than that. 
[02:41:00]  Now the liberties say what, because, you know, I was something I wouldn't pay in the dude, nor was I receiving the check.  But as a dude involved, let me tell you, it was healthy, very healthy.  But it was built in there kind of like, you know, the reason that gets thrown into a contract and signed off on by a studio or a distributor  is because, like, we're never going to get there.  If we do get there, those are rich man problems.  We'll deal with them then.  So then what happens is the movie does do that.  It keeps going.  Good Will Hunting is earning like crazy.  And in order to keep it in theaters, I mean, if it was going to stay in theaters longer than it did, 
[02:41:30]  they were going to have to continue paying Robin Williams like a shit ton of dough.  So right before it hit the next bump level, they pulled it out.  And there's a chance that Good Will Hunting probably could have earned another $10, $15 million.  Wow.  I mean, it was at the end of its cycle, yes, admittedly.  But they had just won some Oscars.  There was still lots of buzz in the air about it and whatnot.  But the economics of the situation dictated that, like, it was less. 
[02:42:00]  They were going to earn more.  They were going to lose less money.  Not lose.  Not the money.  The movie didn't lose money.  But they were going to have to pay out less, particularly Robin Williams.  So they basically couldn't afford it to be any more successful.  Isn't that weird?  Holy shit.  I always found that a fascinating story.  And, you know, I was inside of it, right?  Damn.  We were producers on that.  Yeah.  And it was just like, you know, weird to watch because I'm like, but wait.  The movie's making money still.  Ben and Matt were so frustrated by that. 
[02:42:30]  They were just like, how do you do that?  Why do you pull it out?  Like, you know, we could have kept going.  Could have kept earning.  Could have made another $10, $15.  Who knows what?  Hey, Kevin, didn't he win the Oscar for that?  Robin won the Oscar for that.  He did.  And the boys won the Oscar for a screenplay.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I remember them walking up there.  Hey, Kevin, I got to ask you something.  I don't know.  I'm sorry.  Does that answer the question about Matt, the Hollywood match?  Yes, the bump level.  I didn't know about that.  I would imagine that.  I would imagine.  I have to imagine that whoever the fella is or chick is who made this flick got themselves 
[02:43:00]  an agent before they got involved in selling a movie to Paramount.  But the bump level doesn't sound that impressive, you know?  But I guess that he didn't have a choice.  What else was he going to do?  He couldn't really hold out.  What didn't sound impressive, though?  The bump level?  Oh, no, the Robin Williams, Jimmy actually wrote it down, and I just got lightheaded.  I almost fell over.  No, I'm talking about the paranormal activity bump level.  It doesn't sound that impressive, considering what this movie is going to end up making.  I mean, who knows what the bump level was, though?  Who knows what they built it?  Yeah, you're probably accurate, though.  Kevin, I got to ask you. 
[02:43:30]  When you made Clerks, obviously, you know, low-budget movie, did you have to sell that to a company  and then just kind of sit back and watch it kind of get a cult success?  Yeah, oh, totally.  I mean, and that was, look, Lord knows now I've got a presence all over the Internet,  and I'm a glory whore and a press whore, and I'm out there.  You know, I'm a self-promoting machine at this point.  But back in the day, I was not. 
[02:44:00]  I certainly was not.  I was taught how to be that by Harvey and Bob over the years,  because they were self-promoters, and, you know, their philosophy was always like,  look, you don't have any stars in your movie.  This is talking about Clerks.  You've got nobody out there we can put on a talk show.  So you made the film.  At least you've got something to say about it.  Get out there and talk about it.  So they made the filmmakers the front men for the movies, you know,  and all of a sudden you've had a kind of decade where you have directors as quote-unquote stars. 
[02:44:30]  Like, you know their names.  Like, you know, in the 80s, name some big directors.  There's, sure, you can name your Richard Donners and people like that,  but, like, name some, like, middling-level directors like me from the 80s.  You don't know their names.  But in the 90s, the Weinsteins kind of put us out there,  so you know the names of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez and my name  and a few others that they worked with over the years.  So when you're that person, when you're the front person,  you kind of build up something of an identity. 
[02:45:00]  I got lost in my fucking response.  What were we talking about?  What the fuck were we talking about?  The show has been over for two hours,  and he's just standing with an unplugged phone talking like a psycho.  I was just spinning, hoping I could remember what it was.  We've all been there.  That's hilarious.  I don't even know now.  I was wondering, with Clerks being low-budget...  At a certain point, I got lost, and I'm like,  I just sound so self-aggrandizing. 
[02:45:30]  Fucking Kevin, whoa.  I better remember what the fuck the question was.  You fucking ruled, Kevin.  I just wanted to know, with Clerks being a low-budget movie,  if you had to give it up and sell it, and then...  Excellent question.  I forgot.  And then you went into the end of the Kane Mutiny speech.  Strawberries.  I'll keep it brief.  I'll keep it brief.  All that time, you know, you make the movie,  and your dream is to sell it.  You want somebody to buy it.  You know, the biggest dream,  the one we didn't even dare dream,  was Miramax would buy it,  because they were the gold standard, Joe. 
[02:46:00]  They were it.  So when they bought it, you know,  you're like, oh, my God, all my dreams come true.  It's 15 years later.  You know, in 10 more years over in the UK,  I own it there again.  I will own it in England.  I'll never own it here in the States again,  because when we sold it,  Disney had just bought Miramax,  and all of their contracts, all of their deals,  they put the Imperpetuity Clause,  which was like, we're not buying this.  Like, in the indie community, 
[02:46:30]  distributors would buy flicks  for like 10 years of the clip,  15 years of the clip.  And so Miramax used to do that.  But when Disney bought them,  Disney was like, look,  we're not doing this rent-a-system.  Like, buy the movie.  Own it.  It's more valuable to us  to put it into a library that we own.  So suddenly, when you sold your flick,  you were selling it forever.  But we didn't care.  We weren't like, you know,  babes in the woods going like,  oh, no, we're giving it all up.  All we ever wanted to do  was sell the movie, right?  And so boom, we did.  But then the older you get, 
[02:47:00]  you said, they're going like,  it'd be so cool to own that movie.  Yeah, no shit.  It'd be really nice to be like,  I do own Clerks.  I don't own Clerks anymore.  I made it and sold it.  I'm a sellout.  That's so fucking weird.  You don't own your own stuff.  That is the weirdest thing.  It's your own fucking thing.  It's so bizarre.  That's your, like,  your thoughts.  But that's the game, man.  Like, you know,  anybody that works for somebody else  or you make something,  you sell it to them.  That's the game.  You want to remain a true artist,  one that doesn't ever sell out.  You can't ever sell your merchandise. 
[02:47:30]  I don't want to get personal or anything,  but do you make any money off of that movie?  Oh, Clerks?  Yeah.  Clerks, yes.  Clerks, after many, many years,  went into profit,  which is kind of hysterical.  But anyway,  it's, you know,  Hollywood math being what it is,  or I wouldn't even say Hollywood math,  industry math being what it is,  it seemingly took a long time  for that movie to enter into the black.  But when it did,  it entered like a freight train 
[02:48:00]  and has continued to earn for me over the years.  So, you know,  I made 200,  they paid me $227,000 for that movie.  Up front,  that was it.  That was like the whole nut.  And out of that 227,  100 grand of it was used  to get the movie up to  35 millimeter spec.  So when you go to the theater  and see Clerks,  or when you went to the theater  back in the day  and saw Clerks,  you weren't seeing like  the $27,575 movie.  Right, right.  You weren't seeing $127,575 movie 
[02:48:30]  because they put in the sound mix,  they had to blow it up  from 16 millimeter to 35 millimeter,  and the print costs were included in that.  And that came out of your take?  That came out of the take.  Jesus Christ.  What the hell?  Motherfuckers.  But again, remember,  this is 1994,  and all I want,  I didn't even care,  they could have said like,  look,  we're going to give you  this fucking condom  full of a lot of wad,  and here's two bucks.  Yeah.  And I'd be like,  I'll take it, man, 
[02:49:00]  as long as there's Miramax  at the front of this movie.  Like, yeah,  that's all that matters.  And also,  you've got to remember,  like,  a year later,  everything changed at Sundance.  That's when people started  overpaying for movies.  So at Sundance,  1994,  that was the first time  anyone ever bought a movie  at the festival proper.  Sometimes people would buy movies  in advance of the fest,  and sometimes they'd buy movies  after the festival.  Great timing, Kevin.  But they never bought movies  at the festival.  And John Pearson, 
[02:49:30]  the guy who repped our flick,  he also repped a movie  called Go Fish,  and that was the very first film  that ever sold  right at Sundance.  And it was also a scrappy,  black and white,  independent film,  but it was about girls,  more importantly.  Or more to the point,  it was about lesbians.  So that movie sold  to Goldwyn first,  and then like three days later,  our movie was the second movie  to ever sell at Sundance,  and it sold to Miramax.  Now both of those movies,  I think Go Fish,  John probably got maybe  $500,000 for,  $300,000 to $500,000 for, 
[02:50:00]  which was huge  for a movie like that.  Yeah.  Ours, $227,000.  I remember being  at the restaurant,  like we just set our final  killer screening at Sundance.  You know,  we didn't start,  our first two screenings  were late in the first week  of the festival,  and the buzz just started building.  You know,  at Sundance,  it's easy to sell out.  Everyone's like,  I sold out at Sundance.  You know,  every screening at Sundance  sells out because  the town is overridden  with crowds and whatnot.  So our first two screenings  have been sold out,  but there was no buzz  for us going into that festival 
[02:50:30]  and no buzz for us  at the top of the festival at all.  It was when we got  to our second two screenings  that all of a sudden  the press started writing about it  and all this shit.  So we have our last screening  at the Egyptian,  and it's a killer screening,  and that's where  Harvey Weinstein is.  And then after the screening,  we do a killer  Q&A.  It's just like,  oh my God,  this is it.  And for us,  it was never going  to get better than that.  We were never going  to sell the movie.  Like,  everyone had passed  on the movie.  The festival was the best  it was ever going to be.  And then somebody  yanked on my coat,  and they were just like,  Harvey Weinstein 
[02:51:00]  is sitting across the street  with John Pearson  and wants to sit down  and talk about  selling the movie.  So we went over there,  and Harvey Weinstein  is sitting there  and talking about,  we're going to take this movie,  we're going to buy it,  we're going to fucking  put it on a thousand  fucking screens,  we're going to put it  and fucking multiplexes,  put a fucking music soundtrack  and it was going to  fucking blow it out,  and me and Moses were like,  fuck yeah,  this dude's a monster.  John Pearson  was sitting there with us,  and he says,  look,  the movie's proven  it's not a pig  and a poke,  okay?  We're not saying  give us a mint for it, 
[02:51:30]  but it has a following.  There is an audience  for this.  And so,  you know,  Harvey was just like,  look,  I'll give you  $200,000 for it,  and John Pearson  was like,  they paid $27,000  to make it,  and Harvey was like,  $227,000.  And so,  John was like,  okay,  give us a second.  And we go over  and talk to John Pearson,  and he goes,  look,  man,  I don't think you care  about the money.  I never got that impression.  I was like,  I don't give a shit  about the money.  I said,  but still,  that's fucking huge.  That's a lot of money.  Yeah,  for you at that time, 
[02:52:00]  fuck yeah.  I was at $227,  who's cock do I got  to suck for this?  But,  you know,  he was like,  this is Miramax,  this is where you wanted  to be,  this is the gold.  I said,  dude,  take it.  Like,  I don't even know  why we're in this  conversation.  So,  boom,  we took it.  And that was like,  you know,  after the $100,000  that went away  to blow the movie  up to $35,000,  left with $127,000,  about $40,000 of it  went to paying  off the credit cards  because the movie  was $27,575,  but all that interest  and shit like that.  Yeah,  yeah.  So,  it was about $40,000 off 
[02:52:30]  of that.  So,  you take that out  of that $127,000.  Help me do the math,  somebody.  $127,000 less than $40,000.  $40,000 less than $127,000  would be?  That would be $77,000,  $87,000.  $87,000 less.  And then I cut some  checks for people  involved.  Like,  I paid my parents  $10,000  because they had  loaned me money.  Scott's parents,  $10,000.  That brings us down  to what?  $67,000.  $67,000.  I gave Scott,  I think,  did I give him $10,000?  Yeah,  I gave $10,000.  I gave the boys  $3,000 a piece. 
[02:53:00]  That would be  Brian,  Jeff,  and Jay.  So,  what does that bring us to?  $54,000.  $54,000.  The girls,  they gave a grand a piece  because they only worked  like,  but they only worked  two days on the movie,  two or three days.  Fuck them,  Kevin,  I know.  They're gross.  So,  what was that left with?  Around $50,000.  Around $50,000.  And then,  out of that,  I bought,  the only thing I bought  for myself,  the thing I went  absolutely apeshit with  was I bought  a Dodge Neon.  I didn't know shit  about a car.  You fucking Jersey trash. 
[02:53:30]  I'm going to get me  a pussy magnet car.  Dodge Neon.  So,  what did you do  with the $48,000  you had left?  That was the crazy thing.  It was a cheap car.  I couldn't get my head  around putting a lot  of money into a new car  like I'd only owned  used cars my whole life.  Yeah,  yeah.  So,  like the idea  of getting a new car  when somebody told me  how much they were,  I was just like,  I can't,  I don't want to pay  that.  That's a waste of money.  So,  Dodge Neon,  I think,  was $16,000. 
[02:54:00]  And I was just like,  you know what?  I can swing that.  That is decadent.  That is just,  that is like,  that's me living  like Hugh Hefner  or Liberace,  you know?  And I threw  sauce into the wind  and I bought  that Dodge Neon  and the car  was made of rubber,  dude.  Like,  seriously,  if you pulled  into a spot  and touched  the parking sign,  it dented in.  It was just crazy.  But that was it.  So after it's  $16,000 from $50,000,  essentially $34,000  is my,  that was what  I walked away from. 
[02:54:30]  So,  Kevin,  you didn't have  to take care  of the soundtrack  right now  in the studio?  like when Sony  came in  with the music deal,  they were the ones  that were like,  look,  we'll take care  of all that.  We just,  we love the movie.  We got a bunch  of music we'd like  to put into that movie  and own the soundtrack  and those deals  are kind of like,  you know,  they'll give,  back in those days,  they would give  kind of a token fee  or whatever  to the film,  to the studio distributor  or whatever  to be involved,  but then they 
[02:55:00]  absorbed all the costs.  And where they  helped out a lot  was if you had  a soundtrack,  they were essentially  paying for the music  that you had  in the movie  as long as  it was the stuff  from their label  and whatnot.  So that kind of  worked out for us.  I mean,  we didn't have  that much music.  If you watch  the Sundance cut  on that Clerks 10 DVD,  there's not  a lot of music.  There's Love Among Freaks  song in the beginning  and Berserker  at one point  and some instrumental music,  but nothing else.  I mean,  that came later on, 
[02:55:30]  that soundtrack stuff.  Wow,  that's really interesting.  Kevin,  my Twitter's blown up.  People want to know  if I'm still in the movie.  Yeah,  you're still in dicks,  dude.  Cool.  I lied,  by the way.  My Twitter's not blowing up.  It's a very easy way  to get through  my own neediness.  The scene got  a little shorter.  Every scene  got a little shorter.  My current running time  is 90 minutes.  I think before the release,  before the release,  we'll probably wind up  going up by a few minutes.  But right now,  we're at 90. 
[02:56:00]  But you're in there,  hands down.  And it's a far better  handoff to you  than we'd had before.  Oh,  good.  Just very,  very high profile.  That's good,  man.  You're in there.  You're in there  in a big way.  Do you eat sushi?  No,  heavens no.  Okay,  I was going to ask you  for a sushi date  when I'm in California.  No,  man,  we'll go to that  right by,  because you guys  shoot in Burbank,  yeah?  Yes.  Right by there,  there's an awesome  Philly cheesesteak place,  Philly's Best,  that is run by a dude  who used to work 
[02:56:30]  on It's a Night Show.  I don't know  if he went over  to Leno's new show.  His name's Mike.  But he's the floor manager  on the old show,  I think.  And he opened up  a cheesesteak place,  man,  it's like two blocks  from it.  It is so fucking good.  Oh,  you've got to go there.  Yeah,  it's good.  It's like the authentic,  they fly in the Amorosa rolls  and they use the whiz  and it's great.  Right on.  Kevin,  thanks a lot,  man.  A lot of good insight  we needed.  We were like boggled  about the whole thing.  Yeah,  we were trying to figure out  the whole paranormal  activity phenomenon  and who makes money  and shit.  the best people  to talk to  would have been  the Blair Witch kids, 
[02:57:00]  man.  Well,  we joked about it  during the break,  and it goes,  we're the Blair Witch kids now.  They're still on the job site  right now,  I'm sure.  I don't think we could get them.  Yeah.  They're sweeping up or something.  Do you think this is a...  And those kids  were on the cover  of Time magazine.  No shit.  You know what I'm saying?  Like,  could you imagine your...  I mean,  but one of them,  I know one of them works.  I've seen the dude,  the dude who was in the corner  at the end of that movie.  Yeah.  I saw him in a Law and Order  and a few other things.  Oh, wow.  There you go.  But the other two, 
[02:57:30]  I haven't really seen.  The chick I saw,  she got that guy  from ESPN fired.  Why?  We're talking about  Brooke Hundley  and Steve Phillips?  The Steve Phillips thing.  It's big news.  Yes,  he was having sex  in New York  from 1976.  Meatloaf.  Isn't that weird,  though?  Like,  your first movie,  man,  they put you on the cover  of Time magazine  and you're like,  it's always going to be  like this,  isn't it?  This is it,  man.  We made it finally.  That hard,  that fast,  that quick,  and it wasn't even  like you're doing. 
[02:58:00]  It was just like  you got caught up  in a phenomena.  It just happened.  I would just walk away  from the whole thing  at the end of it  being like,  that was an awesome moment.  I can frame that cover  and I won't be one  of those jackasses  who gets that  fake Time magazine  cover at the boardwalk.  I'll have a real one.  I've got a real one,  but you know,  obviously it wasn't  meant to be,  but still,  I mean,  that's a transition  that has to be made.  A memory like  the first time  you learn to ride a bike  and everything else  is just there  and then it's gone.  But I mean,  but on that level,  dude,  it's like,  it's like your first 
[02:58:30]  sexual experience  being with like  an insane professional.  Yeah,  it's like the first time  you get laid,  Megan Fox puts her  anus on your face.  That's your first one.  And then every time  after that,  it's like you're  begging for a handjob.  Yeah,  it's fucking Mindy Cone  from the Facts of Life.  That's great.  Well,  I come out again,  I come out again  Wednesday,  so I'll call you  before I come out  to see if you're around.  If you're too busy  editing,  we won't. 
[02:59:00]  On Thursday,  I got the,  I go to San Francisco  the day before  I got a gig there.  Okay.  On the 30th,  so I won't be there  on Thursday,  but if you get a Wednesday,  Wednesday,  we might be able to,  oh,  dude,  Wednesday,  meaning tomorrow night?  Oh,  yes.  What time do you get in?  I think I landed  four something.  Ooh,  well,  then come,  listen to me.  God,  I sounded so gay.  That's okay,  I'm listening with  bated breath.  I know,  and it's not going  to be that good.  We're having a screening,  a friends and family  screening of the movie.  Just put it up  in front of some,  some faces 
[02:59:30]  and some eyes and ears  and see how the jokes  are playing.  Okay,  good.  That's at six o'clock  over at Burbank  on the lot.  So if you want to go,  man,  I'll put you down  on the list  and boom,  you're there.  Okay,  again,  I can't guarantee  I'll make it  because of the flight,  but I should be able  to make that.  All right,  then I'll put,  I'll put down the,  I'll put you down  on the list regardless  and have somebody  send you the info.  Okay.  What you need to do  though,  send me,  hit,  blow me up with an email  and I can just  attach it to the other.  Just give me your email  out,  Jimmy.  I can just tell you,  can I have a public email?  It's the real Jim Norton  at Gmail. 
[03:00:00]  That means I got to write you.  I don't know.  I don't,  I don't know what you're,  don't you have my email?  Treat this guy like shit.  I don't have your email.  We'd normally do it  through Twitter.  Yeah.  I can't remember.  I've been messaging.  It was either text  or Twitter,  but maybe it wasn't email.  I thought we had the email.  We never emailed to it.  You texted me.  All right,  hold on.  Let me,  give me the,  give me the,  I don't have your email.  This is hysterical.  The real Jim Norton?  The real Jim Norton  at Gmail.  What a pompous ass I am.  Why are you,  you're supposed to write him, 
[03:00:30]  Jim.  The real Jim Norton  at Gmail.  No,  I don't want Kevin  to give his email  out over the air.  I understand all that,  but you know.  What's that,  buddy?  I said,  yeah,  I don't want to do that either.  Yeah.  The real Jim Norton  all one word?  Yes,  at gmail.com.  Look for an email  from me soon.  Okay,  I almost always be great  if you send this email.  Look for an email  from him and he gave it out anyway.  Then we'd all be the wiser.  Steve from Bayshore  right now is saying,  how many people  are setting up  fake Kevin Smith emails?  Yeah.  Exactly.  Exactly. 
[03:01:00]  I'm going to get,  believe me,  a bunch of bad invites  off the weed  through all the wrong ones,  but they'll fuck up.  You know,  turn left,  faggot.  Oh,  no,  those aren't the directions.  That is the real one.  Yeah,  that's true.  That could be Kevin Smith  very easily.  What are you going to be  duped by a fake Kevin Smith  while I end up  in a back alley  type situation?  I know,  getting raped.  It's going to be like  the screenings  just over there.  Yeah.  Where?  Under that black man's testicles.  He says,  Steve's saying  someone's going to  send you to Compton.  Yeah. 
[03:01:30]  No,  man,  we're going to treat you  like Lorraine Bracco  in Goodfellas.  Go in there,  get that dress.  Get over there.  Fucking dresses  down the street.  No,  over there.  Yeah.  Hey,  Kevin,  yeah,  we got to wrap up.  Let me ask you a question.  In that scene  in Goodfellas,  I always wondered this.  Do you think she was  really going to be killed  if she went in there?  I don't think so.  No.  I think she was  very paranoid about it  and it was more  her point of view  of the paranoia  than what was really  going to happen.  He was not going to hurt her.  No.  Yeah, 
[03:02:00]  I never got the impression  that the guy inside  was going to fucking  do it wrong.  They did look a little  shady in there,  though.  I'll tell you that.  But it's such a great  piece of cinema  because you feel  that tension  and you're with her.  Yeah,  yeah.  You're like,  what's going in there?  I don't want that dress.  I just want that.  And the guys inside  look like workers,  but it's a creepy,  empty place.  And they all stop  and start turning toward her.  Yeah.  Is this the one we kill?  Yeah. 
[03:02:30]  Oh, my God.  Yeah,  you're right.  That is a great piece  because you really don't know,  although personally,  I don't think,  I think it was just her  freaking out.  Conjecture.  And you want to add Scorsese,  but I'm sure like any good artist,  you'd be like,  well,  it's in your perspective.  And I'd say,  Martin,  what did you think?  I wouldn't call him Marty.  I'd say,  Martin,  what did you think?  Martin.  And he'd give you  one of those vague answers  and then you'd say,  hey,  thanks for nothing.  Yeah,  what is death?  Number one,  it wouldn't be vague  and it wouldn't be short either.  My man likes to talk.  Oh,  does he?  Is he a little chatty?  I like to talk,  but he likes it.  He's like what he says 
[03:03:00]  is thinking fast,  though.  You've got to follow it quick.  I got your email,  Kevin,  so I can email you actually.  Roll in,  I know you gotta go.  All right,  Kevin.  Thank you so much.  Thanks,  Kevin.  No worries,  bye.  Bye,  doll.  There he goes,  Kevin Smith.  Fucking,  what a friend.  He's a trooper,  that son of a bitch,  huh?  That was some good insight,  no?  Comes right through,  gives us all the info  I don't know.  Kevin's a very good storyteller.  He can be interesting  talking about movie financing.  I loved when he got tripped up.  As he's going,  I'm like,  he's not really answering my question. 
[03:03:30]  I have no idea what he's talking about.  He was just in a fucking spiral.  That was a,  I just woke up,  and I'm high spiral.  Exactly.  Fantastic,  man.  All right,  why don't we take a break  and we'll wrap up this radio show next.  Opie and Anthony.  Pretty good show today,  huh?  I'd say.  I'd say so too,  Anthony.  Yes.  What else haven't we talked about? 
[03:04:00]  Basketball starts tonight,  but you're not interested in that.  That's all right.  I went off about baseball all season.  You want to talk about  a little bit of basketball?  I'll let,  you know.  It's just that it's starting up tonight.  No big deal.  We'll leave it with that.  My stupid fucking Islanders suck a dick.  Another overtime loss.  Ow.  They've already played,  I think they've only played,  I gotta do the math so fast.  I think they've played 11 games.  Six of them were overtime games. 
[03:04:30]  And they've lost five out of the six overtime games.  That's good,  right?  Their record is 1-4-5,  which is very strange if you know anything about hockey.  One win.  Wow.  Four losses.  And five ties.  Five ties or,  well,  no,  because.  Well,  they get a print for that?  It's,  yeah.  That's five overtime losses.  Five overtime losses.  You're right.  Overtime losses.  You're right.  You're right.  Well,  it's a tie technically because you tie the game in regulation,  then they play for the point. 
[03:05:00]  Oh.  And they don't get any point for that?  An overtime loss?  You get one point.  One point to tie.  That's stupid.  And then you're playing for the other point.  It's really confusing,  and I've turned the corner.  I should ask Kevin about that.  He's a big hockey fan.  I hate the shootout now.  I loved it when it first came around,  but now I hate it.  I really hate it.  Yeah.  The amount of time it takes to get the ice ready for the shootout,  they can just continue playing overtime,  so it doesn't make sense.  Oh,  really?  They got to scrape it all nice?  Yeah,  they got to get the Zamboni out and make a nice little track for the boys.  Great. 
[03:05:30]  I suggest they just take a player away from each team as the longer it goes in overtime  until it's like just two on two if it has to be.  The goalies are just smashing the puck back and forth to each other.  That would be more exciting.  The shootout in the end is just a letdown.  They fight for all that time,  and then it's just...  In what movie?  NHL shit.  Hockey shit.  Oh,  hockey shit.  It would be great to just see two goalies going at it,  and then the one goalie...  And you force the one...  You force one goalie to come out of the goalie and drive at him. 
[03:06:00]  He has to.  Like,  who's going to be the first one that comes out?  Because if he misses,  he's fucked,  and the goalie just has an open net to go past them.  I'm with you,  man.  Yeah,  that'd be fun to watch.  Of course.  Goalie wars.  What are they doing?  Goalie wars.  Oh,  they don't do that.  They're two goalies.  That would be cool.  It's just a shootout,  and it's...  They could just knock it back and forth for a while,  and then the one guy's got to go,  all right,  right,  I'm going to go for it.  Absolutely.  There's a lot of things they could do in sports just to make it more exciting  that doesn't compromise the game itself. 
[03:06:30]  Like,  when the quarterback is throwing that fucking fake pass out of bounds,  28 feet over the receiver's head,  that should be just not a legal fucking play anymore.  They sort of make it like it's got to be close to the receiver,  but we all know he's still throwing it out of bounds.  Intentional out of bounds,  intentional grounding.  They kind of looked at it to make it...  Well,  it's got to be within reach of the receiver.  But it's so obvious.  But it's still so obvious that it's not.  Yeah,  you're just ditching the ball.  In hockey,  they should put it on a tee,  like a fucking baseball, 
[03:07:00]  and you should have to hit the puck off the tee in the shootout  and ricochet it off someone's clit.  Clit?  Can you imagine if you really pitched that at the meeting?  Like,  what?  The fucking face is he doing?  The other thing in hockey,  they're protecting the goalies now.  It used to be the goalie got out of the crease.  You can beat the shit out of him,  knock him down,  and now you really can't do much of that anymore.  And I say,  bring that back.  If the goalie wants to venture out,  then let him venture out.  You know,  it's something they can't regulate,  but I hate that they do,  and they've done this for years and years and years and years. 
[03:07:30]  Quarterbacks just...  Because it fucks them up.  I know that.  Right.  But they just don't run like they used to.  The quarterbacks.  And sometimes...  Don't you watch sometimes and go,  you know,  you could cut left,  and you would have been home fucking free.  But they just...  They cower down,  down the ball there.  And you look and go,  there was no one there.  An opening,  you could have fucking ran in for a touchdown.  Yeah.  Like Joe Willie Namath.  Well,  they're scared.  Well,  that's what happened to Joe Willie Namath.  Does he even walk anymore?  What a drunk pervert. 
[03:08:00]  With really,  really bad knees,  because he liked to run a little bit.  Yeah,  but I mean,  it's so fucking...  How cool is it,  though,  when a quarterback does,  like,  run?  You're like,  holy shit,  look at him go!  Yeah.  It's very cool.  You just don't see it.  But then they safely slide to safety.  Yeah,  they do that stupid slide.  And I think you should force NFL teams to throw the ball around.  You know,  as you're getting tackled.  Oh,  the old lateral?  Like we used to do in the playground.  Force them to do that,  like,  three times a game.  The old laterals.  They have to, 
[03:08:30]  like,  bounce it just before they're being tackled.  They were bearing down on me.  I figured I'd toss it to ye.  You imagine if they had mercy rules in football,  but it was after six points they called the game?  Jimmy,  that's crazy.  You're being crazy.  Now you're just talking silly,  Jimmy.  Just talking a bunch of jazz.  And we'll see what happens with the NBA.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I used to be a big fan.  Not so much these days.  Yeah.  We said Brock Lesnar is not fighting until January. 
[03:09:00]  That sucks.  Brank.  John Gosselin says he returned $180,000 to joint account.  Did the right thing there.  Why?  Researchers believe he,  researcher believes he's found proof that Amelia Earhart landed on a deserted island.  That's been around for fucking years.  Did they find the plane,  though?  No.  They did.  A part of the plane would still be around.  They said they found pieces or something,  but they can't prove it.  They found a tree that said A.H. was here.  And they found a wood dildo she made. 
[03:09:30]  Because there was no one to fuck her on the island.  Why would it be A.H.?  Oh.  Assholes, I am.  I was thinking Earhart.  It's Owen's sister, Earhart.  Yeah.  Amelia Earhart.  But that's what they found.  A nice, polished, wooden dick.  That's all they found.  Yeah.  And they don't want to bring it out in public because it's just awkward for everybody.  They knew it was hers. 
[03:10:00]  Right.  We found something, but.  Because she'd hang her goggles on the end of it after she fucked herself with it.  Something tells me she was not into dick.  Oh, may not.  She looked.  She had the hair cut.  She had the dikey thing going on there.  Yep.  But she was with a dude at the time when the plane went down.  I don't know if Richard Gere is.  Isn't Richard Gere in that dumb movie?  Yeah.  Was he the love interest in the movie anyway?  I don't know.  A love interest, but I don't know if that was the guy that was on the plane with her.  Right.  You know, it was both of them. 
[03:10:30]  And they say that she was shot down by the Japs, that she ditched on an island.  When did she disappear?  What year?  1978.  Oh, I thought it was her.  Yeah.  No, it was 78.  I remember.  I was a little boy.  I was a little boy.  It was 37?  Yeah, 1930.  Why am I shocked?  37.  What year did you think it was?  45.  Everyone knows it's 37.  1937.  Amelia Earhart.  Flying her way around the globe.  Getting back to hockey.  I like Homeless Jim's idea. 
[03:11:00]  I propose a goalie versus goalie fight to end the game.  Goalie-goalie fight?  Just a fight.  Just an all-out brawl in the middle rink.  First one that draws blood wins.  Yeah.  With all that stupid hockey gear on him.  Is anyone going to watch that dumb movie?  Is it out there yet?  The Amelia Earhart movie?  I wouldn't watch anything with Richard Gere in it.  That is a chick flick.  That ship has sailed.  That is a pure fucking chick flick right there.  How do they make Amelia Earhart into a chick flick?  Well, what's she going to do?  There's no fucking shooting in it. 
[03:11:30]  There's too much love interest.  It's just fucking her flying a goddamn plane.  Who gives a shit?  It opened Friday wide already.  We know how it ends.  How does it end?  The fucking bitch shows up nowhere.  Where are you, bitch?  He's lost.  It'll be him sitting there looking at the papers piling up.  Where is this bitch?  Where'd that bitch go?  Yeah.  Breaking news.  Breaking news.  What?  Ray Long Beach.  What do you got, Ray?  I was just driving to work, and I don't know if it's a drill or what, but there's a giant  fire on the runway in JFK. 
[03:12:00]  Do you know JFK has a firefighting team facility over there where they actually have a plane that  they light up?  It looks like a plane, but you know, it's firefighting equipment.  And they train the firefighters there?  Really?  So it might be that, or it might be something smashed.  Well, consider we got CNN on, and they're not acknowledging it.  I think if there was flames shooting off the runway of JFK, and it was something bad. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  I just saw a fire truck going the other way.  I don't know what's up, but yeah, I got to run them on the road.  Thanks, guys.  Well, maybe.  Who knows?  Ray from Long Beach.  We don't know.  We're just a radio show.  What the hell do I know?  Exactamundo.  Imagine if they made the Amelia Earhart movie Total Fiction.  Like she landed somewhere and became like a fucking, a ruler like Genghis Khan.  People are like, this is not true.  What did they talk about?  Is this a biography?  This didn't happen.  This is what happened.  Just don't acknowledge it's not true. 
[03:13:00]  Say based on a true story at the beginning of the film and leave it at that.  Hey, Liz Taylor is twittering about that This Is It movie, the Michael Jackson movie that  none of us will see.  Oh, yeah.  Who's going to fucking go see that?  I don't know.  I guess some of our listeners will.  Oh, who?  Why?  I don't even have a desire for the goof.  Never see that.  Maybe we should see it just so we could fucking really sit through that shit.  What do you mean good luck?  I already got a copy.  Do you?  I could never sit through that drivel.  No. 
[03:13:30]  No.  Well, this is what Liz Taylor's twittering about the movie.  This Is It.  Are you stoked?  Are you excited?  Michael Jackson's big movie comes out tomorrow night.  I didn't think that I would be, but I am.  I really want to see it.  I'm building.  The hype is sort of getting to me, too.  The premiere is tonight.  We know already that there is ringing critical review from, of all people, Elizabeth Taylor,  who is no stranger to good movies herself.  She is saying on Twitter that this literally is the single most brilliant piece of filmmaking 
[03:14:00]  she has ever seen.  She said, to say the man is a genius is an understatement.  I wept from pure joy at his God-given gift.  I wish my vocabulary encompassed what I feel.  You owe it to yourselves and your loved ones to see this movie again and again.  She didn't say that.  140 characters, Liz.  She didn't get that done in 140 characters.  Liz Taylor, I've had enough of her Michael Jackson obsession.  I'm sick of it.  Yeah.  Shut your mouth, fat lady.  Did you think she fondled his balls? 
[03:14:30]  She probably touched him and, like, looked at the different colors and was weird.  These are weird.  They're like a mocha.  It wasn't sexual whatsoever.  No.  A weird thing that you do?  She probably went like, oh, Michael.  I love your balls.  Ooh, the devil's back.  We like the devil.  That's right.  No.  Ten's fire emporium.  I'll burn ye.  I'll burn ye.  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God. 
[03:15:00]  I just got an email.  Yeah.  From Radio Santa.  Which is the most listened to Christmas show on the planet.  What?  How the fuck are they sending me this?  Radio Santa's good, actually.  What is the Radio Santa?  No, it's not.  It's good.  Stop it.  Allaccess.com.  Stop sending me email.  I don't give a shit.  I read your website every once in a while.  Why do I have to get emails from you every day? 
[03:15:30]  What the fuck is that about?  And what is Radio Santa?  I don't know.  God damn it.  I was a Santa one time.  Yeah, were you?  Yeah, I was in a mall.  I got fired.  They said I was behaving inappropriately.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  What happened?  I didn't want to do the big chair.  I said, come in the back.  I'll put the chair in the storeroom.  There's no reason to have all these people look at you talking to Santa. 
[03:16:00]  Santa Claus.  Santa Claus?  Get out of my lap.  I'm finally warming up to Uncle Paul.  It's so fucking creepy.  I despise Uncle Paul.  I'm warming up to him a little bit.  I know you your whole life.  Finally.  Gregory, when you was a boy, I used to come over, rub your back.  All right, now I'm not warming up to us.  You'd cry.  A little rub.  Daniel Oceanside.  Hi, Daniel.  It's actually Fabio.  Hold on.  I got it.  Hold on.  I'm going to go right back to you.  Holy shit. 
[03:16:30]  They had audio of Chastity Bono on one of those fucking gossip shows.  She has started the transformation.  She now sounds like a guy.  Does she?  She sounded like that, Anthony.  How did you hear that?  And they're going to start with big interviews on Thursday.  They were teasing it, but they gave you a little taste.  Holy shit.  She got her fucking tits chopped off, and she sounded like a guy.  What do you got at?  I don't know. 
[03:17:00]  I was just listening to JFK.  Air traffic or something?  Oh, is there anything going on?  I don't know.  They're working between Bridgewood and Nepal.  I don't know this.  We don't want Charlie Victory.  Clean express from the FAC.  Special VFR conditions from the northwest.  Maintain special VFR conditions on the west throttle.  He found track running at a thousand.  The flu.  Any off-temperors?  News 016.  I don't hear any emergencies.  Nah, they would be all over the place with that, right?  I'm just saying fire.  All right, let's go back to...  Where's the fire?  Where's the fire? 
[03:17:30]  But for the guys down the hall, get the chastity.  What's her real name now?  Charles or something?  Of course it is.  Oh, there's the picture, at least.  Look at what...  It almost looks like a...  Oh, God.  It looks like Chunky.  It looks like me.  It looks like fucking Chunky.  Oh, no, Jimmy.  It's Virus, the comedian.  What do you got, Daniel?  It's actually Fabio.  Oh, Fabio.  What's up?  And I'm thinking in hockey, once they go into overtime, after every couple of minutes,  they go and take off a piece of equipment until they have nothing left. 
[03:18:00]  So then you just make a mockery of the sport.  But I...  A mockery.  I kind of enjoy it, though.  I kind of like the idea.  She's horrendous looking.  Thank you, sir.  Who?  Fucking...  Who?  Fucking Chet Bono?  Whatever the fuck his name is.  Chet Bono?  What's going to be his...  I don't know.  What's going to be his he name?  Fucking Chaz.  Charlie Bono?  I think it is Chaz.  Fucking Lorenzo Bono?  I don't know.  Who is that thing?  What's your name, you weirdo?  Freak of nature. 
[03:18:30]  I don't mind a transgender, but Jesus Christ, you have to fucking...  How about losing a few?  Cher had two weird kids, because I think the son she had with Greg Allman had some weird  things going on, too, man.  Did he go fruit?  I don't know.  He was wearing...  There were pictures of him wearing some fucking female shit.  Your mother makes you fucking play a guitar in a video with her ass hanging out and...  Could disturb you a bit.  Yeah, that might fuck you up a little bit.  Good point.  All right.  What else?  We did the pilot story, right? 
[03:19:00]  We got the news story.  Do you want to hear it?  It don't matter, I guess.  What?  You already said everyone got fired in the...  Oh, well...  The pilots that missed the airport.  Yeah, they were on their computers.  All right.  Computers.  Look at the big tats on her ass.  Yes, sir.  Jesus.  Would you?  Oh, yeah.  You have to.  Cher?  Come on, man.  She was a big pussy because she's Native American.  Nope.  I would have maybe back in the old Sonny and Cher days.  She was never hot.  Come on.  Let's be honest with each other.  No, you're wrong.  She was sexy in the 70s, dude.  She had youth on her side.  All girls have youth on their side. 
[03:19:30]  Look kind of...  Yeah, well...  Brooke Hundley has youth on her side.  Oh.  All right.  Well, good point.  Someone had a Seinfeld observation.  Anthony, you're a big Seinfeld guy.  What was the Seinfeld observation about Brooke Hundley that came in that you did not read?  Wait a minute.  Think it over.  This guy says something about Brooke Hundley in an old Seinfeld episode.  I don't have the instant feedback in front of me right now.  If the guys could print...  Travis would know more than me.  If the guys could print up the last two or three pages, that would be good. 
[03:20:00]  But I don't get instant feedback.  No, I don't want you to fucking read it.  I want you to try to think and see if you can come up with what the guy came up with.  She's got man hands?  It has something to do with Jason Alexander?  I'll give you that much.  Might not even be accurate.  She looks like him?  Yeah, really.  That's about it.  Oh, damn.  She looks like Susan?  I have no idea what he's talking about.  She doesn't look like Susan.  All right.  I'll get the instant feedback in a minute or two. 
[03:20:30]  Is it clever?  I don't know because I'm not a Seinfeld guy.  Oh.  I had to do fucking night radio.  I told you that already.  Yeah, but it's all in reruns.  I'm a little behind.  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  I always hated the music.  Let's see.  This isn't going to do me any good.  I need more.  It might be the next page back.  Oh, shite.  You look down?  No.  Oh.  I'm looking down, but no, it's coming up. 
[03:21:00]  I think I know what it is.  Newman?  She looks like Newman?  There you go.  That's a good start.  Does she look like Newman?  I don't know.  Fuck you.  No.  What the fuck?  Not really.  God damn sick.  Come on, guys.  Let's keep it nice.  That's, you know, successive.  Let's keep it nice.  Come on, guys.  Let's keep it nice.  Nice.  Oh, we got to record that.  Michael Richard called her a...  I don't fucking have it.  We're getting another page printed out. 
[03:21:30]  Wow, this shut down the show.  Sure did.  But that's okay.  The devil's back.  Because we have to record stuff.  Yeah, I know.  This was going to be the closer.  The big closer?  Yeah, this was the big closer.  Oh, the Thanksgiving thing.  We were doing jokes about what's the best thing you could do the night before Thanksgiving.  Remember the night before Thanksgiving parties at the Stretch Factory? 
[03:22:00]  Oh, my God.  You suck.  I think it's November 25th.  You suck.  We're talking about Thanksgiving, night before Thanksgiving.  Oh, okay.  Here we go.  Nick from Philly.  Oh.  Oh, guys.  And Martin Luther King birthday weekend.  And I'll be in the Borgata.  Yes.  Very good.  Oh, God.  Is the guy off?  Well, one...  Yeah, no.  That one is even more gruesome.  She's even more gruesome.  It's that girl that when George is going for unemployment, it's the Keith Hernandez episodes. 
[03:22:30]  And when George is going for unemployment, the woman at the desk that won't give him his extension gives him the extension because he makes like he's very attracted to her daughter.  So he takes the daughter out.  And the daughter is like this fucking...  Is it close?  Hundley.  Um, wow.  That woman was gruesome. 
[03:23:00]  I mean, really fucking gruesome.  I don't know.  Me and my girl talk about that.  Someone had to be cast to be the gruesome fucking...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And what is that person thinking?  Knowing they're sitting there going, I just got hired for this role because I'm gruesome.  Make a few bucks off my gruesomeness.  But how do you live with yourself knowing that?  You were just fucking hired for your gruesomeness.  Do we have a picture of it?  Is that your daughter?  That is so goddamn funny.  She's stunning. 
[03:23:30]  It's the picture.  She goes, she's single.  Don't toy with me.  Don't you?  He gets all freaked out.  You know, stop, stop.  She's so ugly that Google doesn't have an image.  Oh, it's horrible.  Google doesn't have an image for her.  We can't find it.  She's not pretty.  Oh, is she worse than not pretty?  How did his day go?  So far away.  It went horrible.  Why?  I don't know.  What are you taking?  A McDonald's or something?  Did he get his extension? 
[03:24:00]  Yeah.  Until the daughter, you know, said what a creep that George was.  But then he promised to get her an autograph from Keith Hernandez because Keith and Jerry  become good friends.  That got all fucked up, too.  We're trying to find it, but it's fucking buffering and shit.  I love Seinfeld.  It's a great kind of damn show.  I don't know any of these episodes.  Oh, they're great.  All of them.  Is it really that good?  Yes.  I'm thinking of starting to watch that show.  It's brilliant.  I'm going to start watching Seinfeld.  It's brilliantly written. 
[03:24:30]  I've been watching Curb Your Enthusiasm.  I have last night's episode DVR.  I've got to watch that.  You like it?  Yeah.  They said last week's episode was fucking really fucked up and weird.  Last week.  But I didn't see it.  Did you see the wheelchair one?  Yeah.  That was pretty fucking funny, man.  Come on.  That was a funny goddamn episode, man.  Yeah.  Larry David is really fucked up.  Like, he's really a fucking weird guy.  You know that's not that much of a put on. 
[03:25:00]  How?  That act.  I've got to say it for the Curb Your Enthusiasm fans out there.  Are you done with Suzy Essman like I am?  Yeah.  I haven't seen her in it that much, though.  Every episode, you're going to yell and scream at Larry.  I get it.  But then the next episode, they're still friends.  Why would you hang out with the fucking guy if he was such a fucking asshole?  Is Jeff Brown still in it?  Eddie Trunk?  Yeah.  He's still in it.  Eddie Trunk.  Suzy Essman has to fucking have the confrontation with Larry.  The show has grown past that shit enough. 
[03:25:30]  We get it.  Is the wife still on or she's gone?  What?  Cheryl Hines, her name was?  They're sort of bringing her back.  I saw her in a restaurant one, I think.  Kind of bringing her back.  I don't know why I said that.  Who cares?  Why would I say I saw her in a restaurant?  You're liking the season of Curb?  Yeah.  Yeah, I am, too.  Yeah, pretty good.  I wanted to get a little more into the Seinfeld thing.  They're slowly getting into that.  Yeah.  I think there's only five episodes out of the whole season that they have them.  So, you know, they're taking it slow. 
[03:26:00]  I know what happens with it, actually.  What?  No, you don't.  They do?  No.  They're all killed.  No, you don't.  The Seinfeld people are all killed.  That would be interesting.  On their way to the first rehearsal.  And Larry David would do that.  Yeah, they're saying the newest Curb is the strangest episode of Curb yet.  Oh, the one from what?  The one you haven't seen and I haven't seen either.  Oh, okay.  I'm going to watch it today now.  Watch it.  That's reminding me.  I've got to watch that today.  What is going on with Bill Cosby's eye?  Yes!  What is going on with Bill Cosby's eye? 
[03:26:30]  He has to wear dark sunglasses.  He wears sunglasses now everywhere.  Every interview.  He's inside in a studio and he's wearing glasses.  His eye went from like one eye being just a little more shut.  You can even notice it in the Cosby show.  One eye is a little more shut than the other one.  Like, all right, whatever.  But now, like it's fucking sealed shut or something.  I never noticed that.  I don't know!  I don't know! 
[03:27:00]  But he's wearing sunglasses now everywhere.  Dark fucking can't see his eyeball sunglasses.  I wonder if he has a light sensitivity or something.  What?  White sensitivity?  No.  Light.  Oh, oh, that's different.  What?  I am officially turning off the instant feedback.  Uh-oh.  Spoiling motherfuckers.  And I'm turning off the phones.  Oh, jeez.  And turn off the show. 
[03:27:30]  And I'm turning off my Twitter.  I am turning off the computer.  No tweets for me until I see Curb Your Enthusiasm.  And it is time...  Motherfuckers.  ...to log off.  Goodbye.  Bye, people.  Uh, here's the Chaz Bono teaser.  But the big interview is, I think, Thursday, Sam.  Make sure you get all of it.  All it's juicy.  Who's he talking to?  Who?  Mary Hart.  Mary Hart.  Who the fuck is that?  I don't know.  She's a fucking staple.  Exactly.  Let her go into a fucking magazine. 
[03:28:00]  I don't know who she is.  I don't know that bitch.  She's been doing E.T. for about 30 years.  Oh.  Fuck all those people.  She had her legs insured.  Amputated?  Insured.  Oh, sorry.  They were so fucking beautiful.  They had to insure her legs when we were growing up.  I bet the value of that policy has been going down of late.  Yeah, let's hear the teaser.  Now that she's got awful old lady knees.  Be speckled liver spots.  Anything worse than old lady knees? 
[03:28:30]  Old lady breath.  Old lady vag.  Old lady knees, though.  So that's what gives it away.  They start looking like elephants.  They start sagging.  Oh, dude.  Take a look.  They get all saggy.  Before they start wearing pants for the winter.  You'll see it.  Here we go.  No, I won't.  Here's the Chaz thing.  A little teaser of what she sounds like as she's going through her sex change.  Starting Thursday on Entertainment Tonight, Sunny and Cher's a little girl becomes a man. 
[03:29:00]  This is your very first interview talking about becoming a man.  Yeah.  I just felt like, you know, male from the time I was a child.  Chastity Bono and her stunning transition to Chaz.  You had your breasts removed.  Mm-hmm.  The hormones have clearly changed your voice.  It does it in stages.  Mary Hart's world-exclusive interview.  I'm in the healing stage.  You shave.  I shave about once a week now.  Starts Thursday on ET.  What the fuck?  Shaves about once a week. 
[03:29:30]  Once a week already.  The whiskers coming in nicely.  It's a little body dysmorphia.  Really fat.  Wanted to be a different gender.  I, uh, the voice is starting to change from, uh, it goes from a female voice to that of  a progeria child to a man.  And I bet she's going to grow a big beard.  Oh, I'm sure.  Because everyone grows the big beard.  What about the penis?  Are they going to give her a penis somehow?  There's no schlong, really, to speak of. 
[03:30:00]  Ah, they pull some shit out, I think.  They pull some skin.  They got to put a hydraulic thing in there, or a pneumatic fucking dick actuator, yeah.  Fucking dick armature sprocket.  I think they do build you a penis, though.  They build you a dick, but it's not, uh...  What does it look like?  We got a picture of the...  Holy shit.  I gotta see one of these things.  Danny, if you could pull up a fucking transsexual's penis.  Guarantee you'll find it.  Pull up penis. 
[03:30:30]  They're gross, man.  Oh, my God.  Get the fuck out of here.  The fuck is going on?  Are these post-op penises?  Nah, I don't know what that is.  They probably look like dog dicks.  That guy...  That's a regular penis.  That could be that little nub.  Where?  Where?  I don't know.  Post-op?  I don't know.  Look, Jimmy's the expert.  He's looking...  No, put, um...  Jimmy...  Female to male...  Genitalia.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:31:00]  No?  Yeah.  Okay, right.  No way.  Female to male...  Transgender.  Let's put something with, uh...  Yeah.  Transgender...  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, that's that...  Buck Privates didn't actually get the, uh...  Yeah.  Where are we at?  Let's see there, yeah.  We got some out right there.  Oh, well.  Oh, well.  Oh, well.  Oh, well.  See, they...  I guess they can't make the peenie.  No, they really can't make a good...  Is that...  What is that?  Oh, my God.  Testicular implants.  No, that's different. 
[03:31:30]  All right.  Scrotoplasty.  What is a...  Who...  Nobody wants to get a scrotoplasty.  That's my screen name.  Yeah.  Why would you ever get scrotoplasty?  Scrotoplasty from Schenectady.  Who's happy to get a scrotoplasty?  I'm going in for scrotoplasty.  Yeah, call you in an hour.  I have scrotoplasty coming up.  Wow.  What is that?  Horrendous.  Post-op phallofac...  Phalloplasty.  Phalloplasty.  Phalloplasty.  Pre-op phalloplasty.  That's a woman to male.  No.  No.  Yes, it is. 
[03:32:00]  Post-op.  Wow.  Retorial release.  Okay, that's fucked up.  All right, now we're starting to look at stuff that might be, like, new penises.  Yeah, that's a...  They built that schlong out of something.  Yes.  They're all little penises.  They're terrible.  They are...  They're terrible little weenies.  They can't really make nuts.  They're weenies.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  It's a little wiener.  Ha, ha, ha.  Glanplasty.  A lot of plasty going on when you have to have a dick made.  How do they fill it up with some of your, like, fucking gut fat or something?  Oh, there's got to be a pump in there. 
[03:32:30]  You think?  I bet there's a fucking, yeah, like a bicycle pump.  You put the little pointy stem that you stick in the basketball on the tip of your dick, and you pump it up.  And even smells like the inside of a rubber tire.  Yeah.  And if you blow out the side of your penis, you got to rough it up, and then put the rubber patch on it with the glue.  It's only 20 grand to get that done.  I thought it would be more.  That's it?  All right.  You wouldn't do that, Danny?  You wouldn't do that?  He's got a penis.  I haven't had a penis.  Danny has a wee wee eye.  Well, maybe for a second one.  20 grand isn't that bad.  Yeah.  All right. 
[03:33:00]  One growing out your ass.  Put on your hip for later.  All right.  We're just babbling.  Let's get the one.  Hey, right.  Is it gay if you suck a post-op penis?  Absolutely.  Yes.  It's like a big toe in the front.  The words suck and penis.  What if your penis is made out of a big toe, though?  Is that gay?  Yeah.  Once it becomes a penis, it's all over.  But it's a toe, though.  It could be made out of a fucking...  No, it still looks like a toe.  It's just where the penis is. 
[03:33:30]  It could be made out of a Twinkie.  If you fucking stuck a Twinkie...  In that area?  In that area, and someone, like, ate the Twinkie...  Right.  ...would be gay.  Wow, E-Rock's really gay, then.  Look at what happened, yeah.  Look at what happened with Sam when he sucked on that fucking big dildo.  Oh, yeah, that's gay.  How gay did that look?  That's hard to deny there, Sam.  Can we go home now?  Yeah, we gotta record something.  I wanna look at more weenies that were made.  No.  Let's all look at wieners.  You can do that on your own time.  That's what the pilots were looking at on their flight. 
[03:34:00]  They overflew the runways.  They were looking at scrotoplasty.  What did they do there?  Oh, God, they're making the labia majora into testicles.  No, they're making the...  Why doesn't someone...  They're fattening them up like a foie gras goose to bring the whole thing back around.  Why don't they hire artists?  Go back up, go back up.  Why don't hospitals hire artists?  What's that asshole?  What is that?  Her asshole?  What's with the asshole?  It's hanging out.  It says here that it's vaginal rejuvenation in a 57-year-old by labia majora fat filling, 
[03:34:30]  minora trimming, vaginal tightening, and anal tag clearance.  I like the...  Anal tag clearance.  Sounds like a big spring sale.  Oh, they got like skin tags on their anus, so they clear that, take a fucking weed whacker  to it.  It's called hemorrhoids.  Let's see how it looks when they're done.  It's not fucking...  I would like to take the hanging lips that they cut off and then just chew it like hubba  bubba all day long.  Dude, what are you doing with a pussy that old anyway? 
[03:35:00]  They should just be building and not open for business signs.  Yeah, what are they tightening it up for?  Exactly.  Hold in the uterus from...  Well, that thing's done anyway.  Yeah, every time she sneezes, a new piece of innard falls out.  Look, great.  So the old bag has the vag of a fucking teen.  Who cares?  What the fuck?  It's going to be used for.  Oh, God.  Wow, look at that.  It's like a trumpet.  What the fuck is that down on the left?  No, look at the one on the right.  Looks like some fucking...  An old man's mouth.  Looks like a fire hit it.  Yeah. 
[03:35:30]  Fucking check that.  Have the arson squad go into that vagina.  Is that a post-op vag?  There's a guy that lost his dick.  What are people doing today?  Just fucking leave your genitals alone.  Stop fixing everything up.  Leave your genitals alone.  Stop fucking with a knife and fixing them.  And can't you tape this this way?  It does angry you, right?  Fucking tuck it in and...  Shut up.  Fix it.  Leave it.  Fix it.  Leave it. 
[03:36:00]  What are you talking about?  I mean, just tease it and play with it.  Leave it alone.  Stop trying to fucking adjust it.  Is that something to make it grow?  Is that like they stretch it?  It says here, actual lengthening by an apparatus.  No, they actually just make everything else in your house shorter.  So it looks bigger.  They make your arms shorter.  And your girlfriend less of a whore.  So she doesn't realize your dick is small.  Your arms and your legs, everything.  Just shorter. 
[03:36:30]  My dick's close to the ground now.  Yeah, they have to go in and fix the whole neighborhood up.  All the chairs are a little smaller.  Let's leave, finally.  Yeah, yeah.  What do you say?  We gotta record something.  Yeah, we got shit to do.  Guys, we'll see you tomorrow.  See you tomorrow.  Bye.  Thank you.  Thank you. </pre>
