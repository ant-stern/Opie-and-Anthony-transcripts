<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show opened with a lengthy discussion about high school gym teachers, fueled by numerous anecdotes from Opie, Anthony, a third unidentified person, Mars (a staff member), and callers.  The conversation frequently employed crude and offensive language, focusing on stereotypical portrayals of gym teachers, their perceived pasts, and humorous (and sometimes tragic) stories about their experiences in high school.  One caller even mentioned their gym teacher was professional wrestler Tito Santana. A running gag involved Sam Roberts’ lack of muscle and a bet regarding his ability to perform a pull-up.  The hosts also touched on staff vacations and perceived inequities in vacation time allocation.

The show then veered into a series of loosely connected tangents.  An anecdote about a female gym teacher's potential advantage in a girls' locker room segued into sexually charged descriptions. This was followed by a discussion of childhood fears, sparked by a teacher's death, which included stories of the Son of Sam murders, Cold War air raid drills, and several disturbing caller anecdotes about school incidents, including a teacher's murder, a security guard imprisoned for rape, a teacher crushed by a bus, and a Vietnam War-themed dodgeball game. Comedian Joe DeRosa briefly guested in a segment titled "Should I Suck a Dick or Not?".

The hosts then discussed the upcoming anniversary of the show, followed by a bit about "Uncle Paul," a recurring character involving sexually suggestive interactions with children.  A negative review of a new Aerosmith album and an exchange of suggestive text messages between Opie and E-Rock, hinting at an unseen event, were also discussed. The mystery of the text's meaning was teased.  The discussion concluded with reflections on the show's ending and Winnie Cooper from "The Wonder Years."

The next segment started with explicit comments about photos of Olivia d'Abo, followed by a discussion of a radio host named "Iraq" and his frustratingly cryptic communication about a mystery guest on his show.  This transitioned to a critical discussion of Khloe Kardashian's performance on "The X Factor," and then to a lengthy phone interview with Guy Fieri.  The interview centered on the negative New York Times review of his restaurant, with Fieri offering positive responses and deflecting criticism.  The segment concluded with a female caller, Nicole, discussing her husband's absence due to suspected infidelity and excessive drinking.

A rambling segment followed, briefly touching upon the hosts' marriages before launching into a Dish Network commercial. This was followed by vulgar messages from the "FU Line," a discussion of the Rolling Stones documentary *Crossfire Hurricane*,  a negative review of the movie *The Comedy*, and the reveal of Chad Dukes as E-Rock's mystery guest, which was met with amusement and incredulity from Opie and Anthony.  The segment also included giving away Guy Fieri gift cards,  a discussion of Long Island strip clubs, and a humorous segment featuring a 1991 news report on video game mania.

A subsequent segment heavily featured Nicole, the caller whose husband had not returned home.  The hosts speculated about infidelity and Nicole’s “sleep rape” accusation, interspersed with vulgar jokes.  Nicole’s producer joined the discussion, expressing frustration. This was followed by a dispute with E-Rock concerning his upcoming show and the Chad Dukes reveal, leading to a heated phone conversation between E-Rock and Sam Roberts.  The hosts plugged upcoming weekend shows, a music show featuring Rotgut, and Steven Singer Jewelers. Anthony's dog was present in the studio during a portion of this segment. Chad Dukes appeared via phone and Nicole's producer was in-studio.

The show featured Chad Dukes as a guest, discussing a past incident involving Don Geronimo, his upcoming appearances on other shows (including with Scott and Todd, and on Roland's show), and his role co-hosting "Bagelin with the Sex." The segment included jokes about Eric (likely the show's producer), a discussion about the best gifts for women, a commercial for Steven Singer Jewelers, and further promotion of "Bagelin with the Sex" and Roland's Food Corp.  The final moments involved banter about an elevator ride and preparations to leave.

O&A every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Rules are destroyed. 
[00:04:30]  And convention burns the ground.  Would you like to make the fuck it again?  With Opie, the destroyer.  I would eat Petty White's ass.  He's 90, right?  That doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony, the rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fair you wanted?  I had these people up my ass all the time trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you.  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:05:00]  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Fatty piggy, fatty piggy, fatty piggy, fatty piggy, fatty piggy, fatty piggy.  Hey.  He rocks a dinosaur.  Why do you think he's fat?  Oh, boy. 
[00:05:30]  Do we get songs swirling in people's heads.  I was doing that last night.  Walking around that.  He rocks a dinosaur.  That was a great find by Travis.  It kind of fell through the cracks.  And Travis was like, you know, there's one more in there we didn't really give proper attention to.  Oh, Travis hit that one with the paddles at the last minute last night.  Or yesterday.  Yeah.  It was last night.  It was stuck in my head.  Yeah.  That one.  Fucking Thanksgiving song.  Oh, yes.  Fucking, man, Freddie.  All of them.  Yes. 
[00:06:00]  Stuck.  Yes.  I just want to keep going.  Tits, tits, tits, tits, tits.  That's another great one.  This guy's not even here, though.  I know.  He's off until, I think, January or something.  Yeah.  It's very obvious.  Our staff gets way more vacation than me and you.  You do know that, right?  I know that because I'm always here when someone's off.  Yeah.  A few of us have seniority around these parts these days.  Because we've been here for so damn long, so we have extra vacations.  Why don't the main guys have seniority?  I think I get two and a half weeks vacation a year at this point. 
[00:06:30]  Dude, trust me.  You don't want to work for the company.  Trust me.  I'll take that independent contractor thing any day.  You know what the problem is?  We see the staff as one entity.  Right.  So when E-Rock takes off one week and then someone else takes off, we're like, wow, someone on the staff is off.  Right.  So it seems like they're always off.  And then we're sitting here like, I'm here every time someone's taking off.  It's just a dumb joke.  I know it's not true.  But it's similar to what happened when I used to cut class in school.  I would cut class.  Yeah.  And I would be like, how come I'm not graduating, but everyone I cut class with is? 
[00:07:00]  And then I realized, because I was cutting every class, and I would be with somebody that used to cut first period, and then someone else that cut second period.  Were you the only guy that didn't suck the gym teacher's dick?  Because how do you not graduate just because you didn't fucking do gym?  I have no idea.  Is that true?  Yes.  That's how you've told it over the years, that you didn't graduate high school because you fucked up with gym?  I fucked up with gym class.  And there's no one in the high school that gives you the passeroo because it's stupid gym? 
[00:07:30]  No, because I had potential, and they saw that and didn't want to squeak me through.  I had to go to summer school for gym.  Summer school for gym?  There was something else, luckily, so it wasn't just gym.  Because if I had to get up early in the summer just to go to the gym, that would have sucked.  But I had to wake up early during the summer, and I would just go play handball with a friend of mine.  It sucked.  I was very active and into sports growing up.  Gym was just a waste of time.  Yeah.  You didn't do shit in gym.  It really was just a babysitting class. 
[00:08:00]  Like, after school was when I did probably three to four hours of gym every day.  Yeah.  Every day.  And way cooler stuff.  Much better sports.  Like, real sports.  Not stupid dodgeball, which was kind of cool, yes.  Yeah, yeah.  Or pushing that huge medicine ball around.  Or playing with the dumb parachute.  The parachute.  Who gives a fuck?  We're learning that square dancing shit.  Square dancing.  We played fucking, you know, baseball.  Yes.  And smear the queer. 
[00:08:30]  Whoa.  That's what we called our neighborhood.  What was that one called?  We didn't even know what gay was.  That was kill the guy with the ball?  Yeah, but we called it smear the queer.  Wow, that's so politically incorrect.  I know, but we didn't know any better.  Damn.  We were just kids.  We didn't know what gay was or queer was.  We just knew if you had the ball, we had to smear you.  Yeah.  And you were a queer, whatever that is.  That's right.  That's right.  Who knew?  Because if you asked me, I don't know where we got the fucking word from.  Yeah.  It's just there.  I have no idea.  Right.  Because we didn't talk like that in my household. 
[00:09:00]  It's passed down through generations of kids.  Nice.  Yeah.  Gym class was useless.  I would go, but then I would kind of leave.  I was the guy that never, you're like,  Come here.  Why aren't you dressed for gym class?  Where's your uniform?  It's like fucking shorts and your dumb fucking t-shirt.  I don't have it.  Or it's squished in my locker.  It's smelling so fucking foul that I don't even want to go near it because I never took  it home to be washed. 
[00:09:30]  Remember how crusty it would get?  Terrible.  And that's not because there was cum all over.  Yes.  It's just because it would be wet and sweaty and you just would leave it in the bottom of  your locker.  Just leave it there.  It stunk.  And the only thing that is actually was supposed to be done was that stupid presidential physical  fitness test.  Yeah, that was dumb.  And no one did anything to make it, like they'd give it to you at some point in the year and  you were supposed to get better because of gym class, but you never did anything in gym  class that would have made you do more pull-ups.  You mean you didn't do proper training? 
[00:10:00]  Exactly.  There's no fucking PT going on in fucking gym class.  You mean climbing the rope every once in a while didn't make you a better athlete so  you would have better numbers?  You can't do one pull-up private pile!  In my high school, we had weightlifting.  Weightlifting?  In lieu of gym.  Like you go to prison?  Pretty much.  Yeah, I was flushing high school.  Oh, okay.  I hate that.  But yeah, that was the only time I ever enjoyed gym because for 40 minutes a day I could just  go and work out with gym class.  Pump some iron.  Yeah, it wasn't bad.  No, we didn't do any of that shit.  Nothing.  I learned my wee-wee could feel really good. 
[00:10:30]  What?  Oh, yeah.  In the locker room.  No.  The gym teacher?  Huh?  Is this back to blowing the gym teacher?  No, man.  Just me climbing the...  Did you guys get to climb the ropes?  I never climbed a single rope.  I was so bad at gym.  I always used to like...  Climbing the ropes, you learn, holy fuck, that wee-wee could feel really good.  Really?  Yeah.  That's what set me down that road.  I was pretty good at climbing that goddamn rope.  Oh, I thought you meant that was pretty good at knowing that my wee-wee felt good.  Fucking that rope.  That's what I was good at.  Keep on fucking that rope. 
[00:11:00]  Fuck you.  I just swung there at the bottom of the rope.  Oh, of course you did.  You never went up?  I couldn't get up.  It's your heritage.  You never went up to the fucking high beams?  No, I couldn't get up there.  No, remember how creepy it was touching that high beam?  Oh, man.  When you lay up there and you fucking go boom!  And you're looking down.  Boom!  You're looking down, it's only probably what?  I don't know.  Well, no, it's a gym.  It was pretty high.  Gymnasium ceiling.  It was pretty fucking high.  Pretty fucking high as a kid.  You're like, holy fuck, if I let go, I'm dead.  Oh, no, you're not.  They got that wafer-thin mat under there that obviously would do nothing but absorb up the  blood. 
[00:11:30]  Fucking mat stunk.  I remember, I don't even know why, but I had one of those angry fucking gym teachers  in grammar school.  And we weren't doing something right.  He had his stupid stopwatch out.  And I wish I remember exactly what we weren't doing right, but just imagine, it was something  dumb.  We were only like 11, 12 tops.  And I remember him throwing it across the gym and it's shattering.  He was just so annoyed in us.  I don't even know.  See, they're all frustrated jocks, first of all.  They wanted to be some fucking big thing.  Do you know how bad they have to feel every morning putting that whistle around their neck? 
[00:12:00]  Do you know when they fucking take that whistle out and put it around their neck, they're  just going, ugh, and thinking of being that fucking football player, baseball player, something  where something didn't pan out and they ended up there putting a whistle around their neck?  Well, why the fuck would he shatter his stopwatch?  To me, I don't have a memory, because to me, it was a who gives a fuck day.  Because he's looking at some kid, some snot-nosed kid that doesn't know how to do shit instead  of coaching some fucking baseball player. 
[00:12:30]  And you're kind of right, because we had one of those guys, but he actually was pretty  cool.  The story goes, he either was on the nets.  They all were on something.  Or they were almost on the nets, because he would tell a story every year.  Mine was Denver Broncos guy.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  My guy was something to do with the New York Nets at the time, because they were playing  on Long Island.  Yeah.  And he blew out his knee.  My guy blew out his knee, too.  They all blew their knees out.  And that's why he's now a gym teacher.  Same thing with Gil Lilienthal. 
[00:13:00]  So maybe that's what they teach you in gym teacher college.  Yeah.  Just tell your kids that you were a star athlete, but blew out your knee.  And that's why you're here.  They'll give you a little more respect.  Instead of, you know what?  I didn't really know what I wanted to do with my life.  So at the last minute, I decided I was going to...  I went to college.  I took some college courses on child psychology and physical fitness.  No, they just need some washed up jock that blew his knee out.  Yeah.  They know that no one's going to respect you if you tell the truth.  Like, well, actually, the drinking started when I was 12 years old. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm a raging alcoholic.  This is pretty much the only thing I could do with my life.  Toes on the line.  Now I'm going to tell you about my Tommy John surgery.  What?  Exactly.  Really?  Your guy was a Broncos guy?  Oh, he was a Denver Broncos.  My guy was a New Jersey.  I want to say New York Nets.  Big fucking lineman, and he blew his knee out and ended up as a gym teacher.  I would love to, like, get the stats right now.  How many people listening to us are going, holy shit, my guy was... 
[00:14:00]  It's my guy.  My guy was a Minnesota Twain.  He blew out his knee in spring training.  How many?  It's like talking to how many hippies were at Woodstock.  It's way too many.  No, but I bet you a lot of people that was the story I got.  Yeah, that's the story.  We had a social studies teacher who was also the baseball coach, that all the rumors were  that he was, in his college days, very close to being a professional baseball player.  Almost signed.  Blew his knee out.  He must have blown his knee out, because he didn't make it.  He blew his wrist out writing some social studies. 
[00:14:30]  I know, there's a story of a guy, he made it...  He started his career with two bad knees, as a matter of fact.  Oh, man.  18 years ago.  Oh, hey, well.  With two very bad knees.  This is the story, he tells the first day of school.  Yeah.  In gym class.  In a dream to become a major league baseball player.  Jeez, coach is crying.  But it didn't come true.  What happened, coach?  What happened?  I thank God the dream came true.  Nice.  Coach is crying. 
[00:15:00]  Fucking hilarious.  What a faggot.  So that fucking gym teacher had it out for you.  Yeah, yeah.  So who gives a fuck?  If you did everything...  Did you do everything else or you're leaving something out?  I may have been a little remiss in my social studies work.  I remember cutting a lot of that.  And it's odd because I do enjoy a good social study.  Yeah.  But I enjoyed smoking the marijuana cigarettes with my friends a little more.  And then I was from the school of thought that if I missed a certain amount of classes, 
[00:15:30]  I could never venture to that side of the building anymore.  Because if the teach saw me, it would be embarrassing.  And the more days that went by, the more behind in the work I was,  and the more useless it would have been to go back into class.  So it would be months at a clip.  I'd get caught, get sent down to the office, have the chat,  and then now I'm back in the class, new slate, clean slate, new start,  and I'd fuck it up again.  But you wanted knowledge. 
[00:16:00]  I love knowledge.  You were one of those guys that wanted knowledge.  So why wouldn't you just make sure you graduated high school?  I should have.  I know.  Hindsight.  It'll be hindsight.  I should have.  You know, going back to the gym teacher thing real fast,  I just had a quick thought.  Fast forward about, I don't know, honestly, probably only five years.  And there's going to be a bunch of snot-nosed kids in a gym somewhere,  and the gym teacher is going to come in and go,  Hi, I'm Tim Tebow.  You might remember me.  No. 
[00:16:30]  For my stellar college football career, and, well,  I was a bust in the NFL, but I'm here now.  I'm here now.  My gym teachers hated me.  Of course, you stink.  I used to make jokes and put no effort into anything.  Oh, like your show.  Yeah.  Well, at least I make jokes.  Yeah, that's true.  That's all it counts.  Well, you don't have a hint of a muscle on you,  so I would imagine that gym teachers would hate you.  Seeing me hang, I was the guy hanging from the pull-up bar,  going, one, Sam, you could do one, Sam. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, no.  Do one.  I'm like, can't do it.  Did you pop a quarter off your ankle for him  and show you that you got ankle muscles?  You can't do one pull-up.  I'll bet I could now.  I bet you can't.  I bet I could.  Let's get a pull-up bar in here.  We need a pull-up bar.  Well, can't we do the fucking door jam pull-up bar thing?  We probably could if we had a pull-up bar, yeah.  Put some money on it.  Where's Mars?  You know Mars has all his workout.  Of course he should.  He has a Nautilus machine.  He doesn't have a radio show to worry about.  Well, he quickly puts things away just before I get here.  Yeah.  I get here around 5.30.  There's weird videos being played 
[00:17:30]  and all sorts of shit out in our studio.  His perfect push-up handles on the floor.  You know he has all his workout shit here.  Perfect push-up handles.  Does he have those?  I got those.  I got those.  Yeah, because then you could go down a little further.  Are those ones that twist?  I got the twisties, too.  Nice.  I got the two.  I got the ones that don't move,  and then I got the twisties.  Nice.  Yes.  I don't use them right now.  Are we putting some money on the pull-up?  Yeah, I'll fucking put $100.  For one?  You can't do one pull-up.  All right, $100 for one.  Where's the pull-up bar?  You have to go all the way up.  See, he does have them.  Holy shit, there's his perfect push-up little things. 
[00:18:00]  He really has them?  Mars has them.  Mars, I knew you.  I was making that up.  That's great.  Mars has all sorts of workout equipment around here.  Mars, you got a pull-up bar?  No, unfortunately not.  That's why I was working on that one.  I pull up to the bar.  See, because I drink.  Wow, look at all the dust on your...  Yeah, why is that so dusty?  Look at all the dust on your push-up things.  Not true.  Mars, you do push-ups here?  Yes.  Obviously not.  How many?  What?  Oh, damn.  Well, that was my joke with the dust on the things. 
[00:18:30]  Is that a UFC shirt?  No.  Is it a jiu-jitsu shirt?  Yes.  All right.  I see that jiu-jitsu.  Brazilian jiu-jitsu.  Yes, sir.  One of the mixed martial arts.  Yeah.  So, yes, I try to knock out 300 a day.  Really?  What?  300 a day.  Sets of 30s.  10 sets of 30s.  Isn't that hard?  10 sets of 30.  Yeah.  You could do that.  Not with the twist at the end.  No?  With the twist.  That's pretty impressive is what I'm saying.  But it's not...  The twist is a motherfucker.  It takes me about 20 minutes. 
[00:19:00]  To do 30?  Yeah, resting.  30 push-ups?  You go down like this.  No, that's 30 push-ups.  You missed that.  30 push-ups?  30 push-ups.  You do 300 push-ups?  One, I got to rest almost a minute.  You do 300 and 20 minutes?  Two, I got to rest another almost a minute.  No, no, no, no.  What?  Yes, yes.  300 and about 20 minutes in.  The fuck?  I don't do 300 a year.  I'm calling ESPN, by the way, because someone makes a great point.  Ratspin in Vegas, one of the regulars.  You are officially the worst black athlete ever. 
[00:19:30]  Sam Roberts?  Wow, Sam.  I'm waiting for that pull-up bar.  I'm getting the 100.  You're that exception to the rule.  I'm getting the 100.  Mars, you think he could do a proper pull-up?  No.  Not one, right?  Not one.  Not one.  Not one.  You got to go all the way up and get that chin to the bar.  All right, I'll do it.  Yes, got to go over.  You know who's a pull-up maniac?  Who?  That's the Troy.  Really?  Yeah.  Troy's a pull-up.  Can I knock out 20?  One arm like this?  20's hard, man.  I can't.  I don't even know how many. 
[00:20:00]  20's rough.  I can maybe do half that.  Which way?  Well, so he says.  Which way?  Oh, this is all hearsay.  This way or this way?  The harder ones are when your palms face away from you.  Yes, palms away is a lot harder than palms.  Why would you do it that way?  That's the way the Marines want it.  Yeah, but why?  I'm a Marine!  It's for your wingspan.  Your lats.  And the other way doesn't work the lats out.  It's also the top of your forearm instead of the underside.  So, you know, this is a lot harder. 
[00:20:30]  Believe me.  Believe that.  I can do it the easy way, right?  I can do it facing me, not facing out.  It's part of my upper body workout regimen.  You still won't do one.  Even facing in, I can't?  No.  Look at your arms, man.  It's $100 on the line.  I can do it.  Stupid biceps.  You've got to lift your whole body up.  You don't have a hint of a bicep.  Your arms have no clue what $100 is, so they ain't going to help you.  Oh, he loves...  Look at his little arms!  Oh, Sam loves free money, though, so he'll give it a good try.  But look, there's not a hint of a muscle on his arms.  If Jack White's names had more than one syllable each, it would have wrapped around your fucking 
[00:21:00]  arm.  You'd be in trouble.  Yeah, how do you make a Jack White tattoo look like a wraparound?  Like an arm band?  It's tribal work.  Like a tribal, thank you.  That's the fucking joke.  Damn it!  I have high tendon strength.  Is that it?  Your tendons are really powerful.  You better hope.  By the way.  By the way.  Everyone's writing in.  This guy pumping mangos, Coach Hill, Boston Celtics, knee. 
[00:21:30]  Knee?  I told you.  It's always those knees.  And to this day, I believe these guys, but now, you know what, I think it's their MO  because they're embarrassed.  Yeah.  You know, you're not embarrassed if you're...  You almost made it, and something beyond your control made you a gym teacher.  And I'm not talking about, like, the high school football coach, the junior high school  football coach, the junior high school basketball coach, the track and field guy, the gymnastics  coach, all that.  No, I'm talking about the guy that's just fucking teaching gym.  The gym teacher. 
[00:22:00]  To a bunch of idiots that just are wasting 45 minutes to an hour, whatever the fuck  it would be.  Hooligans.  Those guys are embarrassed, so they're saying shit like, yeah, you know.  Oh, I could have been.  I was this close to playing with Johnny Bench.  Let me tell you the story.  Yeah.  Tell me.  This guy's gym teacher was Chris Mullins' brother.  Oh, lovely, this guy.  I know.  What's with this guy?  That guy's an asshole.  Yeah, he is.  I'm so glad you're into the walking past the window thing, finally. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I've been playing that game for years.  It's terrible.  To myself, even.  Yeah, yeah.  I have a comment about every person that walks by.  We have the blinded by science guy.  Yeah, yeah.  We have the guy that ruined his entire life over something stupid.  And then we got the guy from, what's that fucking, the Canadian guys?  Doug McKenzie.  Bob and Doug McKenzie.  He looks like one of those type of guys.  Yeah.  He's trying to be like the cool guy.  He's real gangly and dorky.  Yeah.  And he wears the hat that like hipster would wear. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, the tassel.  What's his deal?  I don't know.  I think he's one of the engineers.  But he's like an ugly guy, too.  He's not like a good looking guy.  He just went into the room where they listened to us.  Well, he's not.  Who cares?  The ugly one in there.  We're talking about you.  Yeah, let him know.  Real brave, Sam.  We have to fight.  We're going to have to fight your battle.  Like you're our chick.  Oh, get us in a fight now.  Thanks.  I don't have strong arms.  Huh?  I don't have strong arms.  I'm not the skinniest little thing.  I'm not saying I'm an MMA fighter, but compared to Sam Roberts, I certainly am. 
[00:23:30]  Make a little muscle, Sam.  Make a little muscle.  But you're like.  You're like.  Nothing happens.  Wow.  Like nothing happens.  Everyone has something that moves up.  There's a little something there.  Nothing happens.  There's a little rounding here.  Oh, my God.  So we're going to have to fight your battles.  Like when our chicks get us in trouble.  Yep.  Hey, we got Kevin from Connecticut.  Bravo.  He writes Coach Hamilton.  Boston Patriots.  Blew out his shoulder.  Yeah.  Blew out his shoulder.  At least it wasn't a knee. 
[00:24:00]  Tito Santana was this guy's gym teacher.  What?  Nah.  The wrestler.  I even remember Tito Santana.  He's a wrestler, of course.  Connor, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, you know how high school, you always had like one marking period that was health class  instead of gym?  Health, yes.  Yeah.  So we show up one day in a health class.  We had a substitute gym teacher come in.  And he's got his back to us.  This big guy.  He writes his name on the board.  Merced Solis.  He turns around. 
[00:24:30]  He goes, hello, my name's Merced Solis.  I'm like, no, you're not.  You're frigging Tito Santana.  What the hell?  And he was like, oh, yeah.  So we spent the rest of the marking period just talking about wrestling stories on the  road.  Oh, my God.  Dream come true, Sam?  If Tito Santana was my teacher, I would go to school all the time.  It would be the greatest thing ever.  So they should make wrestling characters all the teachers in school.  And that way, people would just go to class to hang out with them.  You're right.  You're right.  All right, sir.  Tito Santana.  I knew we were going to hear from one gym teacher. 
[00:25:00]  We got Chris in Jersey.  Chris, go ahead, buddy.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Is Jim Norton today or no?  No.  No, he's a busy man.  Oh.  All right.  Gym teacher.  Everybody I know who has become a gym teacher has done it because you can make over $100,000  a year, you get summers off, and you can stand around and watch a bunch of little 16-year-old  girls running around playing.  So, Anthony, it's a perfect job for you.  I know the $100,000 isn't enough money for you. 
[00:25:30]  No.  You're watching little girls run around all day.  Come on.  I guess there's equity in that.  Asshole.  Anthony, how's Chris?  No, no.  Just 16-year-olds running around all day.  All right.  Thanks.  That's a great call.  No, he just sounds like an asshole.  Michelle says they now do yoga and aerobics in gym.  Yeah, they got to update the curriculum.  You know, I'm sure they get into, like, the latest fads.  The gym classes in the expensive places, do they have spinning? 
[00:26:00]  What's your...  Spinning classes?  Michelle.  I spit when I said spinning.  Morning.  How do you know they have yoga and aerobics?  I am a high school teacher.  I'm not going to tell you what subject that is.  Oh, come on.  Let me guess.  English.  Oh, how did you guess?  Because you sound very articulate.  It's called taking a stab in the dark.  All right.  Listen to Penn.  He'll let you know how I guessed that.  Yeah, you could have said you had some magic powers right there.  Exactly.  Fuck.  You're so intuitive.  Yeah.  Do you unbutton your blouse a little lower than the other teachers? 
[00:26:30]  I knew I was going to walk into this.  Tits.  T-I-T-S.  Tits.  You know, one of my students actually said to you one day, Mr. Gil, can you...  Oh, shit.  I just said that.  Oh!  Don't bow for her.  Too late.  Too late?  Yeah, it's all right.  You know what?  But he said, can you spell attic?  And I'm like, yeah.  I-T-T.  I-T-T-I-C. 
[00:27:00]  Right.  He nailed you.  I-T-T-I-C.  I-T-T-I-C.  I-T-T-I-C.  Oh, is that an old gag?  Killed her.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't remember that.  That's funny.  It's like saying spell I-C-U-P.  Spell it.  Right, exactly.  I-C-U-P.  Well, stop looking at me then.  Ah!  Ugh.  Yuck.  No wonder you have no muscles.  Fucking weird.  I got all the jokes.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  So, yeah.  Are you sexy?  Yeah, now that we know your name, maybe you should shut up. 
[00:27:30]  I'm going to, like, I'm going to help you out a little bit today.  Well, I'm going to go up to the conglomerate of gym class.  You have yoga.  You have spinning.  You have summa.  You have ziplining.  There's rock climbing.  Ziplining?  Hold on.  I love-  We should open that up to every nationality, by the way.  How do you zipline in high school?  There's something I did it myself with one of the other gym teachers, and it was a hell  of a lot of fun.  They set it up in, I don't know, in the field area. 
[00:28:00]  Really?  Holy shit.  How cool is that?  I bet you needed some fucking- I bet you had to sign off on that for insurance purposes.  I actually didn't have to, but it was a hell of a lot of fun, and I'd do it again.  You know, I just-  Ah, so it was a special gym thing they did.  Special thing.  But still, that's cool.  You go to school one day, and they go, hey, good news, we're ziplining today.  Holy fuck.  I mean, I was here saying rock climbing?  Rock climbing.  Holy shit.  Wall climbing.  They handed out shitty fucking hockey sticks and made us run around the gymnasium floor  playing floor hockey. 
[00:28:30]  Right.  And that was a good day.  Right.  I threw out my back at 12 years old, because they decided that hockey sticks had to be  really short.  Yeah.  Ah, it sucked.  Had to go through the rehab.  And I can tell you that my memory of an elementary and middle school gym teacher was an ex-marine  who was dishonorably discharged.  There you go.  Yeah, they are army guys, too, sometimes.  Oh, yeah.  I had one that died in the NAM.  You did? 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, child of the 80s, by the way.  I had a-  Yeah, yeah.  You had a guy that died in the NAM?  Yeah, he went over there for child sex in 1988, and-  Oh.  No, no.  He, uh, yeah.  It was a big-  It was a big deal.  Uh, the gym teacher was going, um, off to war.  Uh, and he came in in his uniform and everything.  Holy fuck, what a sad story.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  He came into the cafeteria.  It was like the cafeteria.  I remember, like, eating lunch and everything.  And then, uh, the principal made an announcement, like, here he is, uh, a hero, and stuff. 
[00:29:30]  And he comes out, and he's all decked out in his fucking uniform.  And, uh, the whole place, like, goes into applause, all these kids fucking clapping and  shit like that.  Like, a few months later.  Uh, we- we regret to inform everybody that-  And they told the kids!  Oh, my-  Why couldn't they say he moved to California?  He gave his life at the cost of freedom.  Oh, my God, no.  In Vietnam.  How old were you?  Uh, this had to be, like, maybe third grade-ish. 
[00:30:00]  You don't tell fourth graders.  It's like when your pet dies and your dad goes, no, we took it to a farm.  It was so fucked up.  You don't tell the truth when they're in third grade.  Some kids were crying.  Some kids had no idea what was going on anyway, you know, because it's that age where some  kids know a little more than others.  And you're sitting there blaming the Democrats, I bet.  I was like, fucking Obama.  Fucking Obama.  People were like, who?  Who?  Oh, don't worry about it.  You'll know soon enough.  You'll know soon enough. 
[00:30:30]  You'll know.  All right, Michelle, you hot, sexy thing.  Get to school.  Yeah.  Keep it clean for me, boys.  All right.  Right.  Take it easy.  Bye.  I know we tell you stories, but I love retelling our shit.  Of course we do.  I remember our principal, I think his name was Leon or Leone.  Maybe someone from Washington Drive School can help me.  And it was very similar to you.  One Monday, we're all in, all happy, getting ready for school.  And the announcement comes over that Mr. Leone died over the weekend. 
[00:31:00]  He was scuba diving out.  I think it was near Riverhead or Waiting River.  He died.  They're still searching for his body.  But we just want to inform you guys that he has passed.  I guess they don't want the kids hearing it on the street.  On the street?  You know?  We didn't have Twitter or anything.  We didn't have, like, grief counseling either.  No.  So they would just tell you and be like, well, there you go, kids.  That's life.  And in grammar school, you know, the principal was everything.  Yeah.  You know, everyone felt like you had a personal relationship with the principal. 
[00:31:30]  While I'm sitting there, you know, do it for Manny and our gym teacher.  Sal.  But you don't tell us this.  And then I remember as a little thing going, oh, my God, that means everyone dies.  Where's Manny?  Our heroic gym teacher.  I think it was in the Air Force.  I think he got shot down.  Damn.  Yeah.  Fucking Hanoi.  Goddamn Hanoi Jane was manning the fucking gun herself, I bet.  Damn.  Fucking bitch.  That was my first memory of death, though. 
[00:32:00]  I wanted to do the whole village.  First memory of death, though.  The principal dying.  That's pretty.  It was creepy.  Small little fucking grammar school, and there he goes.  And then there's a new guy.  And I think they introduced the new guy, like, the next day.  Kind of like when your parents try to make it all good with the new pet.  I'm like, no.  How about we mourn the old pet for a while?  Don't throw a puppy on our lap a day later.  I looked at, like, the new Darren Stevens that they brought in.  And then every time.  Just keep calling him Darren.  And then every time you saw the principal, you were reminded, oh, that's right.  You're here because the guy we loved is dead. 
[00:32:30]  You're a replacement.  It was creepy, man.  Yeah.  We never really gave him a shot, because I remember I was in sixth grade.  It was my last year of grammar school.  So to me, it was like, ugh.  You know?  I'm sure he had a wonderful career, and he ended up being loved by all the students.  But everyone had to be moved.  You know what I mean?  It probably took six years to get all memories.  Out.  Of the old principal that died in the scuba diving accident.  Yeah, yeah.  And then he would have a fair chance of being the new guy that everyone could love and appreciate.  But I remember every time looking at the guy, like, oh, God, death. 
[00:33:00]  Death, death.  That's a nice little reminder for a child.  Fucking horrible.  Who was your coolest teacher?  Oh, man.  Actually, my coolest teacher was when I was in California.  She, I talked about this at some point.  She played Jane in the Tarzan and the She-Devil movie.  Did you look that up?  Yeah, yeah.  I don't think you've ever said this. 
[00:33:30]  IMDB.  I don't remember this story.  I can't remember her name.  Tarzan and the She-Devil is an old movie.  Yeah.  Boy, this is going to make a bunch of people tell jokes now.  Oh, my God.  The actress was.  It's a black and white poster.  Yes, Miss McKenzie.  Joyce McKenzie.  Google Imager.  Was, she was.  Oh, that's her, like.  Years later.  Years later.  She was my English teacher.  Really?  Yeah.  There she is.  Oh, my God. 
[00:34:00]  She's like a Hollywood star.  Yeah, she is a star that almost made it.  And that was her big movie.  Holy fuck.  Why do you pick the worst picture always?  It's in color.  Who gives a fuck?  The ones in black and white were way better.  She didn't die in 1949.  Yes, Joyce McKenzie was my teacher at Dana Hills High School.  She's almost good looking.  She's almost good looking.  She was almost a big star.  The problem was she wasn't good looking enough.  And the odd thing is everybody used to, like, goof on the fact that she was in movies and stuff. 
[00:34:30]  But I was fascinated by it.  Yeah, it is.  That's, that's, no.  That looks like, what's her name?  A man's.  With the big tits.  Not me.  Yeah.  The one.  The, the, the.  Yeah, the one that did the bra commercials.  Jane.  Jane.  I was going to say.  Jane Russell.  Russell.  Russell.  Thank you.  I was going to.  Oh, that's not her.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Wow.  She was your cool teacher.  She was cool.  She was in Hollywood for a moment.  She used to, uh, like, stay after class and, and tell me about, like, Hollywood.  Really?  I was fascinated by it. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  Well, it sunk in.  Yeah, yeah.  Not that we're Hollywood, but you're in the entertainment business.  Ah, see?  Well, barely.  As much as she was, I guess.  Tarzan and the she-devil.  Yeah.  Her big part.  She's still alive, by the way.  Still alive.  Why don't you write her a little note?  She wouldn't remember me.  I bet she's got the Alzheimer's.  She's probably fucking calling everyone fucking Cheetah and Tarzan.  Imagine that.  She's in the old folks' home, just being inappropriate with black people. 
[00:35:30]  Jesus.  Well, her fucking-  What's your favorite teacher?  Miss McKenzie.  She was very cool.  My favorite teacher was Mr. Fincher.  I wonder if he's still alive.  Oh, Fincher.  Oh, Fincher.  Fincher.  Mr. Fincher.  Hey, it's funny.  Fincher was the coolest.  Yeah?  Yeah, because he would open up the gym on weekends.  He was that guy.  For what?  Orgies?  Who knows?  We probably all were touched.  Have we touched? 
[00:36:00]  You just blocked it out.  Have we touched?  I went there to play floor hockey, but what have we touched?  I hate the fact that you block that shit out, because you always got to wonder.  You got to wonder.  Because what adult male opens the gym up for kids on the weekend?  To a kid that's 11, 12, I guess, because it was still that grammar school age.  Oh, hairless.  It was the coolest thing ever.  Sure.  But you're probably right.  I would feel like a creep if I brought a whole bunch of 11, 12-year-olds to a gym and  was the guy that wanted to spend my weekends in a gym.  Jesus. 
[00:36:30]  You know what, Sam?  You're right.  Fuck Mr. Fincher.  Terrible.  Peter Weller from RoboCop was my teacher in Syracuse.  I know.  No way.  Yeah, he was.  Let me finish my Mr. Fincher story.  Looking for me.  Yeah, we'd play floor hockey.  Yeah.  How great was that?  I hated the floor hockey.  Huh?  I hated the floor hockey.  Why?  I don't know, because it was like a rip-off.  It's like, look, I can't skate, and this is stupid without skates.  Yeah, but our gym floor was slidey.  Was it?  Were you playing your socks?  Or then again, maybe because I had shitty sneakers growing up. 
[00:37:00]  I was the only one being slidey.  Like, your soles of your sneakers had no grips on them.  One pair of sneakers a year.  They were bowling shoes.  One pair of sneakers a year.  That's not bad, though.  One pair of sneakers.  What were you doing?  For a kid?  It's not bad when you're in your 40s.  But when you're like 10, 11, or 12, are you kidding me?  Yeah, you go through them a lot, huh?  Holes right through the bottom before we got new ones.  I didn't do much sitting in front of the television with sneakers.  Oh, see, no.  We were very active, and we got one pair of fucking sneakers a year.  That is a fact.  I didn't, yeah. 
[00:37:30]  So they were very, very, very slidey.  Yeah, I didn't do a lot of physical activity outside of school.  Why?  I was fucking television guy.  You were never, like, outside building forts.  I had to be chased outside.  Fighting other fucking kids in their forts.  When I did go outside, I, you know, did that shit.  But for the most part, I liked coming home from school, plopping down in front of that  TV, and just watching everything.  Yeah, but commercials, fucking, I was a TV addict still am. 
[00:38:00]  I still watch six hours of TV a day, but then I got a good six hours outside, I think.  I went outside, but it wasn't imperative.  Whatever, two or four hours.  And I wasn't doing a lot of physical activity outside.  I would go out with, like, my model dinosaurs, and I would go in the weeds and be like,  At 22, that's weird.  I know.  Yeah, yeah.  Yes, yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I loved my dinosaurs, marching, marching. 
[00:38:30]  We should have a muscle-flexing pose-off between E-Rock and Sam, like they do in the bodybuilding  contest.  E-Rock actually had, like, under his fat, he actually has muscles.  No, you could see his muscles.  Yeah.  E-Rock could probably get very fit if he just had a little discipline.  I think, yeah.  Just a fucking iota of don't eat that and a little bit of lift that.  Oh.  And he would probably.  I just didn't like that Chris guy that called in, and he's probably still listening. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  He just sounded like a douchebag.  Yeah.  And I should have called him out on it, because Tommy's like, I'm a physical education teacher.  I definitely don't make anything near 100 grand a year.  Tommy.  And I knew that wasn't true when he said that.  No.  No.  Maybe it's the phys ed teachers that double as, like, the counselor or something.  And you want to hear, here's another horrific story.  Kevin.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Oh, he's still affected by what he's about to say.  My gym teacher was Chris Mullin's brother. 
[00:39:30]  And if you wanted to see a miserable fucking person, it was Terrence Mullin.  He was supposed to be better than his Hall of Fame basketball-playing brother until he blew out his knee in high school.  My buddy, uh, my buddy, buddy, actually.  Buddy knows Terrence.  Really?  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, he's friends with him.  Yeah.  What?  Is that, is this your call?  I guess he's saying that.  No, but is this your call? 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  All right.  We have a problem.  Again.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  And I went down this road the other day, and the caller felt bad.  But, and then me and him went back on Twitter.  I'm like, no, it wasn't about you.  I mean, and your call's fine, sir.  It's fine.  But it's not the reason why I picked up your call again.  Oh, no.  Just like a couple days ago.  It says on the screen, our coach was an award, and tell me if this is you, and maybe you  chose not to tell the story.  Our coach was at an award show at the gym, and while he was getting his award, he had 
[00:40:30]  a heart attack and died on stage.  Not at all.  Of course.  Oh, my God.  And that's the reason why I took your phone call, so I'm not trashing you personally.  I just had something else in mind when I picked up your phone call.  Was it Sal again fucking up?  Was it Sal?  It was Sal, but Sal's adamantly defending himself.  Sal.  Machine error, not operator error?  Look, I don't like to defend Sal, but it is possible because I've seen comments roll  over from one call to the next.  I don't know. 
[00:41:00]  What if Sal just wrote it in the wrong box?  I'd rather blame Sal.  Yeah, I mean, it's more fun to blame Sal.  Is that comment on two different boxes?  No, because this guy, though, I saw that, I already read his comment that he was, his gym  teacher was Chris Mullen's brother.  So maybe Sal wrote it in the wrong box.  I think Sal wrote it in the wrong box.  I think Sal wrote it in the wrong box.  Sal wants to explain himself.  Sal's a panicky Pete.  I am panicky Pete.  This never works out well.  No, he should not defend himself.  Oh, God, no.  Go ahead, Sal.  What happened, man? 
[00:41:30]  No, the software's kind of buggy, and sometimes it'll duplicate a comment over.  And it's like a known thing.  No, it's known, except to us, Opie, because we're stupid.  That's what Sal just said.  You can see it in there when it duplicates the comment?  He said, whatever happened to Sal growing a mustache, by the way?  He just...  Hey!  Can I tell you?  Oh, my God, I'm so glad you brought that up.  He just chose not to do it anymore without asking anybody if he should still continue  doing that?  You remember how stupid my hair looked while it was growing out, right?  Thank you, Anthony.  You're welcome.  I asked him last week what happened to the mustache, and he said, you know, I just thought 
[00:42:00]  it looked stupid, and I didn't want to go out like that.  See, I can't be around a kid like that.  Oh, God.  That's more of that entitled shit.  You remember what Danny looked like an asshole for so long?  Sal, why wouldn't you just show us a little respect as your elders and go, you know what,  I know you want me to grow a mustache to look like a hipster, but I'm not feeling it or  something.  At least have the conversation.  But he decides.  Or just do it, but it's part of the radio show.  It's part of the show. 
[00:42:30]  Well, that's how it used to work in the past.  We would put these guys in horrible situations, but they would play it out.  But we have a million of them that happened over the years, but Sal just decides on his  own without telling anyone that he's just going to, you know what, I'm not into this.  What are you going to do?  Do you remember when Eastside Dave was growing his hair out and we shaved a horseshoe bald  spot in his head?  And he left it.  Yes.  He left it because it's part of the show.  Eastside Dave, best fucking radio, like, I don't want to say stunt guy because he's 18 
[00:43:00]  billion times more than that.  But there's no one better at just doing anything.  Because he commits.  He commits and fucking runs with it.  And he became legend.  Legend.  Yes.  I am legend.  They didn't want to pay, what, an extra $2 an hour?  Insane how they fucking let him go.  I'm still reeling over that still.  So they let him go from the Ron and Fez show?  Yep.  I'm still reeling from that.  Does this company want to hire a new talent or not?  Or do they want to wait for us to all just fucking die out and then they'll figure it 
[00:43:30]  out?  It's a great question.  Fucking idiots.  Eastside Dave.  How do you let Eastside Dave go and just throw him a little weekend show for a couple  hours a week?  One of the greatest talents.  When he was full time on Ronnie's show, kicking ass.  Eastside Dave.  All he wanted was a little more money so he could afford to get here.  He wasn't even asking for money so he could buy a really nice house for his family.  No.  To get to work.  The deal was, I am spending most of the money I make getting here because he lives down  on, you know, in the Jersey Shore there. 
[00:44:00]  So he goes, look, I can't afford to be there anymore.  So can you give me a reasonable raise?  And they said no.  They said no.  And Sal's walking around here with a clean upper lip.  Oh boy.  I remember years ago, myself, Danny and Fan all grew mustaches for two weeks.  For mustache day.  And not only did you grow them for mustache day, they didn't, Opie and Anthony didn't  even make an on-air bit out of it.  No.  It was just fun to have around the hallways.  And we all looked like assholes. 
[00:44:30]  Yes.  Yeah, you did.  But it's more of the same entitled shit.  Sal decided he's done with the bit.  How come Sal's not growing the mustache?  We could have easily said, you know what, yeah, maybe do whatever you want.  I don't care.  But the fact is that he doesn't even, like, come to us.  Yeah, why wouldn't you?  How come he's not growing the mustache?  He said it looks stupid, I think.  Right?  Ask him.  Sal?  I'll grow it.  You already said you would.  You said that already.  You're lying again.  I don't need you growing a stupid mustache.  You already said you'd grow it.  No, thank you.  You said that before.  Yeah, fuck it. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, we're fine.  We're good.  I started to do it and I just didn't like the way it looked.  You just go about your life your way and let me know how it works out in four years.  Tell us how things are.  And then you can bitch to some stupid fucking reporter about how we treat you bad.  Oh boy.  How about if Sal wants to make good, all the staff could shave their pubes and then we'll  glue them to Sal's upper lip for a mustache.  Huh?  Pube mustache.  What do you think of that?  Is this a hotline down here ringing?  Why is this phone way down here ringing?  It's just a regular call. 
[00:45:30]  It's just a regular call, Hope.  Oh.  I'll screen it.  Why don't you just type something random in the box?  All right.  This guy might be the other guy.  The other guy?  That I wanted.  Troy in Iowa.  Troy!  How's it going, my boy?  What's up, Troy?  I was just telling Sal about it.  Now, the guy was our actual football coach as well.  Okay.  But he was our PE teacher.  And he was at the awards, the sports awards.  And as he's getting up on the stage receiving his award, he just keels over and has a heart 
[00:46:00]  attack right there on stage.  In front of all the kids?  In front of the kids?  Well, it was a nighttime thing.  So it was basically in front of all the players.  Oh, my gosh.  But it was in front of all the family and stuff like that.  And it was a really shitty year that year because we also lost our shop teacher.  What happened to him?  Same thing.  Heart attack. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, those kids will fucking do it to you.  Oh, the worst.  Jesus.  The worst teacher death we had.  I mean, the scuba diving accident at Washington Drive School was tragic.  Al-Qaeda decapitation?  Huh?  Oh, I was going to say the worst.  That would be pretty bad.  Which one?  Al-Qaeda decapitation?  It was a decapitation.  No way!  Yeah.  Wow, that's bad.  And I don't remember.  It was a few years after I left Washington Drive School.  Yeah.  I believe her name was Mrs. McCutcheon, I think. 
[00:47:00]  I don't want to get this wrong.  She was up in Canada.  So the story goes.  Oh, no.  And you know it snows a lot up there, right?  It certainly does.  This is the story that was told.  And if it's true, I don't know.  You want to turn the lights out and put a flashlight up to your face while you tell this?  It was a dark night.  Supposedly she was enjoying Canada for whatever reason.  I don't know if she was from there or vacationing.  I don't know.  Sounds impossible already.  I have no idea.  But snowy out. 
[00:47:30]  She's in her car.  I believe she was with somebody else.  And, well, she either skidded out of control or the plow skidded out of control.  Oh, no.  A plow?  While the plow was up.  Oh.  And the story goes she was decapitated.  I'm like, holy fuck.  Wow.  That's pretty bad.  A snow plow decapitation.  It's got to be pretty thorough.  Yes.  That's not one of those Dale Earnhardt, you know.  Technically, it was a decapitation.  That's fucking. 
[00:48:00]  That's fucking.  That's gone.  Your head is fucking in the snow pile on the side of the road.  But, you know.  Yikes.  It could have been one of those telephone games where maybe it was something way more normal or whatever.  Right.  Or not as horrific.  Over the years.  Over the years.  That's like the story around my neighborhood about Stoneface the cop.  Stoneface the cop?  Stoneface the cop was, you know, it's like, oh, look out.  Stoneface.  He was the cop you didn't want to get fucking pulled over or harassed by or anything.  Right.  He was this old guy with pure white fucking hair. 
[00:48:30]  And he'd drive around.  And the story was, Stoneface was just a rookie cop a few years back.  And he was driving around.  And he saw a horrific accident.  Drunk teens smeared all over the road.  Overnight, his hair turned pure white.  And he was old.  And he was only 30 years old.  But he looked like he was in his 40s.  Right.  Because he was old.  And you never fucking wanted to do anything that was dangerous and have Stoneface catch you.  Right.  Driving drunk. 
[00:49:00]  Driving recklessly.  Because he would throw the book at you because he felt so bad and wanted to prevent that scene that he saw so many years ago.  That put him, made his hair turn white overnight.  And you were 34 at the time.  Yeah.  Hanging out at Leahy fucking elementary school playground.  You think these assholes, like, make up these stories behind the scenes?  He must have laughed his balls off at the fact that, dude, I'm Stoneface.  Cool.  I get to be Stoneface.  Like in the locker room at the fucking precinct.  Right.  Probably like, hey, Stoneface. 
[00:49:30]  All right.  This is the deal.  Fuck you, asshole.  You know, drunk driving's way up with teens.  Yeah, yeah.  We got an idea.  I'm Stoneface.  We learned this at the police convention.  I'm only 30.  In Des Moines.  They come back with these ideas.  Yeah.  We had a cop named Bullethead.  That's pretty funny.  Bullethead.  Yeah.  With the PE teachers that were women, lesbians, we've done that bit a million fucking times.  Yeah. 
[00:50:00]  A million fucking times.  But it is true, in Harborfields High School, the gym teachers had an office in the actual  locker room with the glass.  With the glass.  Like, the three sides of their office was glass that looked right into the locker room.  Yeah.  And when I went to Harborfields High School, there were suspicions that our female gym teacher  was certainly, you know, gee.  They love the pussy. 
[00:50:30]  Well, we grew up in an age where you weren't basically, you weren't basically allowed to  say you were a geek.  You didn't say shit.  That spiky fucking hairdo they would have.  But you kind of knew there was something going on.  And I don't know.  Maybe, maybe that's not true.  But I always thought it was hilarious that her job was to, as a gay woman.  Yeah.  Looked like she was probably, if I look back now, she was probably late 30s, early 40s.  Oh, boy.  And she wasn't really allowed to express her sexuality. 
[00:51:00]  No.  She went to a job where she went into the female locker room, into her glass office every day.  And I remember as a kid thinking that could be the greatest job you could ever have in life.  Oh, my God.  For a guy or a lesbian woman, it's perfect.  Right.  Jeez.  And no one was the wiser.  Nope.  Can you imagine what was going through her head as she's driving to the high school every day?  She gets there early every day.  Best job ever. 
[00:51:30]  Holy.  You name a better job than that, if you're in that situation.  Holy shit.  You're looking at the 15, the 16, well, high school 16, 17, 18-year-olds?  Jesus Christ.  Just stripping down to nothing because they think they're in a safe environment?  She must have been sitting on meringue all day.  Just fucking, just loving life.  Just looking out at the locker room?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  Fantastic.  Just yelling and screaming during your commute because you're stuck in traffic because you want to get there so bad. 
[00:52:00]  Yep.  Lovely.  Aunt does that wonderful bit we don't have to do here.  Oh, we don't have the whistle anymore.  Yeah, that was the one.  We should find that bit and replay it.  Aunt's done it a bunch of times over the years.  She can't blow the whistle.  I forgot about that bit.  Yeah, it's like fucking Kate Winslet at the end of Titanic trying to blow the whistle because she's so turned on. 
[00:52:30]  She's trying to blow her gym whistle, but she's shaking with fucking just sexual energy.  She's so horned up.  She can't blow the whistle anymore.  If you could find that, we haven't played that in years.  I don't know about that one.  Why make Aunt redo it if we could just play the tape?  Of course.  If you find it, that would be great.  E-Rock's home.  Call him up.  Tell him where the fuck the file is.  I got lucky with teachers, though. 
[00:53:00]  Skated around the them dropping dead issue pretty well.  Only that one guy from the NAMM.  That's a horrific story.  I wonder how he went.  Bouncing Betty, maybe?  Maybe punchy sticks?  That's horrible.  What'd he do?  Or do you just roll a Jeep over, pulling out of the motor pool?  What happened?  I think, in a way, we bitch about how kids are being raised, because I think we're raising  a lot of wimps with all the PC shit.  But then there's also things like, why would you tell a third grader that one of the cool 
[00:53:30]  teachers died at NAMM?  And there was no one to go to?  That's what I'm saying.  Look, I'm feeling really sad about the gym teacher you just announced for getting fucking  killed in the NAMM.  Maybe.  I talked to someone about this.  We're talking about this.  What are you talking about?  I don't know.  Jesus Christ.  I'm just the principal.  Right.  I'm just giving you the info.  I'm a bean counter at this school.  I don't know about kids.  That's all on you, little fucker.  Yeah.  Deal with it.  Suck it up. 
[00:54:00]  Walk it off.  Pull yourself up by your bootstraps.  You said you were in third grade?  Yeah, it was like fourth, maybe.  So that's like 10-ish.  Yeah, 10-11.  How does a 10-year-old deal with the death like that?  You watch fucking John Wayne and the Green Berets and realize, hey, he was kicking  ass.  Oh, my God.  That's what he's doing.  He's over there saving, making our life safe for democracy.  So when you learn, especially at that age, you know, someone died, it puts you in a  horrific, lonely, scary place.  Oh, petrifying.  Just a petrifying place.  And then I didn't know.  I thought the fucking Vietnamese were coming over here. 
[00:54:30]  Because we had, we had like air raid drills in my school where it was, it wasn't like the  fire drill.  It would just go, and you'd be like, ah, the fire drill was the bell.  It was like, and the red bell was in the school in the hallway.  And you're like, all right, that's the fire drill.  But the air raid siren thing was this little speaker all around the school, these little  fucking scary little speakers.  And it would go, and you'd be like, ah, and you'd have to get under the desk. 
[00:55:00]  Right.  It was petrifying.  I'm like, wait, why do people want to drop bombs on us?  We're at school.  We had to go, we were lame.  We just had to go in the hallway.  Yeah.  And stand up against the cement walls.  Well, that happened later on in life.  They would put the elementary, the younger children in the corner between the wall and  the floor.  Right.  And they would duck down in a little ball.  And then you would be on like your knees.  Right.  Over them.  Like, and put your hands against the wall, put your head against your hands. 
[00:55:30]  That was sex.  Protecting the, well, no.  That was sex.  It was something.  You were so petrified.  That the bombs were coming.  Well, that's why.  You're thinking that it was a, it was a, it was a drill.  Yeah.  So that's how they trick you.  Yeah.  When they're molesting you.  I thought.  You thought you were doing some kind of air drill thing.  No, no.  You were having heinie sex with the younger kids.  When that was, when that was going on.  As the teacher got off on it.  That's what happened.  Yeah.  Maybe that's what was going on.  When that was going on, I was the older kid that had to protect the younger kid. 
[00:56:00]  Right.  I never was the younger kid.  Because when I was the younger kid, we just went under our desks.  That's the bomb proof desks that have been goofed about so many times.  Well, it's a desk.  It's okay.  Yeah.  It's hack.  Because in the end, if there was some, God forbid, bombing, that dumb desk wasn't going to protect you.  I guess they were more concerned about breaking glass and those ceiling tiles coming down on your head than an actual direct hit with a bomb.  From the, from the, it was the time, can I say, do you think?  Oh, sure.  No, I can't say.  What were you going to say? 
[00:56:30]  Gooks.  That's a bad one.  No, it could be the Chinese.  They were, they were very scary at the time.  That was part of the Cold War.  But it was mostly the Russians.  I'm just going back in time.  That's what they would say.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They would.  Blah, blah, blah.  They would.  Sorry if I offended you.  That was part of the vernacular of the time.  Yes.  But that's what the commies were called, man.  There was a constant, I remember going to sleep at night at some times and just thinking like,  there could be a nuclear missile heading this way right now.  Oh, really?  And we wouldn't know anything about it. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, it was kind of consumed with atomic war and the thought that there was a gun pointing at us,  a figurative atomic gun all the time.  That was your biggest fear?  What's that, Sam?  Hold on.  What, Sam?  No, no, no.  I was just going to say, at what age?  Oh, boy, it had to be one.  All right, look, shut up.  No, but that was your biggest fear when you slept at night?  Let me tell you something.  For many years?  Yes, that was at one of the top of the list.  No, because I got one.  Uh-huh. 
[00:57:30]  My biggest fear when I was at that weird age where you just knew you couldn't really take care of yourself,  I was worried about David Berkowitz.  Son of Sam?  Yes.  Child of the 80s.  I was convinced that there was a possibility that he could kill me and my entire family.  David Berkowitz was a scary motherfucker at the time.  He was a scary motherfucker.  Yeah.  But women in cars.  44 caliber killer was fucking...  But he was loose out there somewhere, and the news told you, man, he's a dangerous man, 
[00:58:00]  and he's loose out there.  And then a few days would go by, and there would be another couple killed in a car somewhere,  and it horrified me.  And I was convinced that he could fucking come into our house and do damage to me and my family.  People would park on the side of the streets in the boroughs, mostly, of New York City.  Queens, right?  Queens.  A lot of Queens.  Brooklyn.  And they'd park to make out.  And Son of Sam, David Berkowitz, would come up with his .44 caliber revolver up to the back window  and just blast him in the fucking head. 
[00:58:30]  Right.  It was petrifying.  And every so often, it was like, holy shit, you hear he struck again last night.  Right.  And people were scared to just do anything.  It was one of the scariest times.  Crazy.  For New York City, as far as that shit goes.  He turned out to be a fat Jewish mailman.  Right.  From Yonkers.  From fucking Yankees.  Who has since found Gwad.  Westchester.  He has found Gwad.  Best Chester.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy.  That was my fear when I went to sleep at night.  Nah, I didn't care because I was out on Long Island.  I was in Suffolk County.  That's where I was.  That's what I'm saying.  I know.  Pretty far from the fucking action. 
[00:59:00]  My point is, yeah, exactly.  How stupid is that?  I was far from the action.  I was a teenager not making out yet.  I wasn't in cars in the middle of the night.  Really didn't fit the MO at all.  Of course not.  But it scared the shit out of me every night.  I wasn't going out to Long Island and breaking into houses.  No, I would wake up in the middle of the night.  Okay, he's not here.  And go back to sleep.  Yeah, I just thought of the nuclear bombs that were all pointing toward us.  You really did.  Because there were just so many aimed right at us.  Oh, you were alive for the Cuban Missile Crisis. 
[00:59:30]  No, I wasn't.  Sixth grade?  Wait a minute.  I might have been alive for it, but I wasn't.  Better check the date on that.  I don't remember it, though.  Okay.  I was alive for it.  I don't remember it.  I was a mere youngster.  Yeah, but that's when they were really worried about fucking missiles and stuff.  You want to hear a whole thing?  It might look.  You want the most horrific teacher story?  Yeah.  I'm going to call this the most horrific teacher story.  Mike has it.  Mikey.  Yeah, I'm here.  Go ahead, man. 
[01:00:00]  1974.  Third grade.  They told us that one of our teachers was drugged out of her car.  And they poured gasoline on her and lit her on fire because she'd pissed off some gang members in Cucamonga, California.  Cucamonga?  What?  Who told you that?  Like, the principal told you that?  No, they announced that she had died over the weekend.  And then later on, it was in the paper.  And our parents decided to sit down and tell us what exactly. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, my God.  Why would you.  Why we should be careful.  Venture out after dark.  Well, that's just as scary, I guess.  That's pretty bad.  You got to sugarcoat that a little bit.  They didn't.  Not back then.  I mean, that was just a matter-of-fact thing.  And, Anthony, you grew up a little bit in California, the Skid Row Slasher.  Our parents were blunt with us about that.  Well, I was in San Juan Capistrano.  Not much happened there as far as I wasn't in L.A. or anything, you know.  All right.  All right.  Great story, bro.  You know, not far out of L.A., but, you know, just all kinds of crazy stuff. 
[01:01:00]  I had to worry about parties at Jimmy Jackson's house where some crazy Indian was going to stab me with his knife because his wife wanted to have sex with me.  That's what I had to worry about.  One other thing real quick.  Yeah.  The thing that scared me the most when I was in grade school was the sheriff's helicopter shining that damn light into the house at night as they were chasing somebody through your backyard. 
[01:01:30]  Growing up on Long Island, we never had that.  World star hip-hop, yo.  We never had the helicopters in the air with the fucking searchlights.  No, the only time I ever saw helicopters out on Long Island was if there was a giant wreck on the fucking expressway or something.  It was never to look for criminals.  No, never.  Just to clean up the mess.  I was always stressed out.  Oh, go ahead, sir.  They would use the sheriff's helicopter to chase people that were running from the cops, and they're searching the backyard.  And as a little kid, I actually had this nightmare that the devil was in the helicopter.  There was no way to get away from him.  So the guy on the ground, the devil is in the helicopter. 
[01:02:00]  That's it.  All right.  Good stories, bro.  Thank you, sir.  Let's see.  In high school, our security guard got life in prison for rape.  There you go.  Junior high school, one of the special ed teachers got crushed by the special ed bus.  That's ironic.  When I was in elementary school, they used, thank you, they used, they moved to California as code for the teacher dying.  And I would get suspended for telling the kids what that meant. 
[01:02:30]  Because he figured it out.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  I got to take this one.  Tim on Long Island.  Tim.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah, I was telling Sal, when I was in elementary school, we had two gym teachers who were both Vietnam vets.  And they used to play a little game of dodgeball, but they'd modify it.  And they would call it Ho Chi Minh Trail.  And they'd stack those little foldable gymnastic mats that they can fold up and put them in the corner. 
[01:03:00]  They would stack, kind of fold them up, stand them up on the side, make little tunnels.  You would run through those tunnels.  And at the end, when you're going to throw the ball, they would scream crazy war things at you.  And you had to throw the ball completely at people.  And it was basically like full metal jacket.  That sounds great.  Oh, it was great times.  We had eight different variations of dodgeball.  And these guys were lunatics.  You had to crawl through.  You couldn't do things.  Those stupid little carts that you sat on when you had to pretend you were driving. 
[01:03:30]  You had to use those.  They were like tanks.  It was great.  See, this is taking lemons and making lemonade.  They had bad experiences in the non, but they brought it back and made it fun for the children.  It was good times getting yelled at.  That sounds it.  Good times.  Very good, brother.  I like that one.  And unfortunately, the last call I was going to take for this break, a guy said that his teacher was really nice to him.  Yeah.  Because his father was banging the teacher. 
[01:04:00]  I want to know how he found out.  Oh, God.  Oh, we have a short version of the gym teacher bit?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to break with this.  All right.  All right, girls.  Good workout.  Good workout, ladies.  It's time to shower off.  Hit the showers.  Come on, girls.  Come on.  Come on, girls.  Shower off.  That's it.  Get those uniforms off.  Debbie, pick up my whistle. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, God.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  He continued through the break.  Anthony's new bit.  We were all clueless when we were in school.  We had no idea.  And then you grow up, you get a little knowledge out in this fine world of ours, and you go, what the F was going on in school with the dyke gym teacher? 
[01:05:00]  She was a little manly.  That's all.  But she was.  Didn't know she was, you know, doing that with other women.  They were all called Miz.  Miz.  Miz.  The first ones to be called Miz.  Miz.  They're in their 40s called Miz.  Well, we're taking your dyke gym teacher stories.  Diana from California. 
[01:05:30]  What's up?  Hey, it's me again.  How are you guys?  Like, we're supposed to know who you are.  It's Diana from California.  I'm just shaving or talking shit or shit and shit while you're shaving your quits.  And she curses a lot.  I apologize.  I forgot you guys were on this.  But when I was in middle school.  Just let it go.  Whatever.  Go ahead, Diana.  When I was in middle school, we all, we knew our teacher was, we didn't know what she was, but we knew we didn't want to be naked in front of her.  She, we get, you get checked for scoliosis when you're a certain age. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, that gag, by the way.  Yeah, let's get into that a little bit.  The physicals.  We talked about it for weeks beforehand because we didn't, we're like, are you really going to do it because you had to take your shirt off in front of her?  And she got you in your bra.  So it was like, we were all, it was weird.  We didn't know, we weren't, we didn't know what gay was, but we knew what gay was.  Scoliosis test today, girls.  But, but we just had him yesterday.  Not a scoliosis test.  Could happen in a day.  You never know.  The test was flawed. 
[01:06:30]  We got to do it again.  Yeah, the result's a little flawed.  So line up on the line here and take your shirts off, girls.  Beep.  Beep.  Beep.  Line.  Line up on the, ladies.  Oh.  Scoliosis test all week.  Oh, dropped my whistle.  And the best part about that, too.  Hearing test, girls.  Hearing test.  Take off your shirts.  Why do we have to, don't, don't talk back. 
[01:07:00]  Hearing test, you got to take your shirt off.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius X.  Sirius XM.  Welcome to Should I Suck a Dick or Not?  The show where nationally known comedians meet our panel and try to decide, should I suck a dick or not?  Today's guest, Joe DeRosa. 
[01:07:30]  I do a bit about this, about, like, the stair step up to it.  It's like, it's not as easy as would you just swallow the cum.  There are many levels of things you need to get through first.  I might be fucking all in.  I might want to go all the way.  Here's the thing.  Now, what would you do with the dick?  That's the thing I don't know.  That's what he hasn't really answered.  I wouldn't be into swallowing any jizz.  No, you have to.  That's the thing.  Why are you making these rules?  Florentine's rules.  Because it makes it more interesting.  Florentine's rules.  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No.  I've had my own jizz on my face.  What's the difference?  It's another man's. 
[01:08:00]  Wow.  It looks like Joe DeRosa is going to suck dick.  That's all the time we have this week.  Tune in next time when Ricky Gervais tries to decide.  That's not only a dick.  That's the biggest dick in the world.  Should I suck a dick or not?  Well, it's time to bring it down a bit.  Yeah.  Making plans with Jim and Tom.  You going to stick around for the Sunday show?

That's Teddy and his little brother.  The one on the other side's the girl.  She's kind of tomboyish.  She likes to play basketball.  Have her socks taken off.  Coochie-coo, you tickle him in a tub.  Oh, Uncle Paul, my feet are dirty.  She'll wash him. 
[01:10:00]  Get him in a tub.  Clean their feet good.  Take your shorts off.  Let me kiss your toes.  Oh yeah, they all had to stay in my bed cause they all had bedbugs in their cribs.  Come in here so there's no bedbugs.  And then them goddamn parents are accusing me, saying how come he ain't walking right?  I don't know.  I didn't do nothing.  Bunch of lies.  Those damn denar tests.  They said my denar was on the boy's hiney.  I don't know what that means. 
[01:10:30]  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul, Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare.  Uncle Paul.  Now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now cause here comes Uncle Paul.  Sirius XM.  This is the OPN3 Show.  What is this, Aerosmith? 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, pretty sure.  This is a bad article about Aerosmith.  What is it, Aero?  Aero?  Aero.  Everyone says Aerosmith.  But it's Aero.  Aerosmith.  Aero?  Yeah, they're trying to be Aero.  I say Aero and I'm gonna fucking still say that.  Fuck you.  But some say Aero. 
[01:11:30]  Bad article in the paper, man.  Yeah?  Their album's a bust.  Even his duet that he sang with...  Who did he sing a duet with?  Kelly Clarkson?  They're not happy because...  Carrie Underwood, I think, right?  Carrie Underwood.  That one, right.  They're not happy because the album came in fifth place, I believe.  And Rod Stewart's Christmas album even beat it.  Oh.  Ew.  And no one's playing Christmas songs yet.  No one's playing Rod Stewart? 
[01:12:00]  My mom likes the Rod Stewart.  Really?  Yeah, because he decided to do all those standards.  Oh.  He found a whole new audience.  He found another niche.  He does standards.  What is it called?  He's up to four or five of them now.  Standards.  Where he sings all the classics.  New York needs a standards station.  Right.  Oh, Jesus.  I remember that on Radio Message Board.  There's always some tool radio guy that insisted, New York needs a standards station.  No, it doesn't.  Know who's been cool to us lately?  Who?  Because we call them all out. 
[01:12:30]  Got a lot of honesty on this show.  Who dat?  John Minnelli has been very cool to us on the New York Radio Message Board lately.  Really?  Yep.  I haven't delved into the message board in quite a while.  I go there.  Well, people tell me.  So I went over there and read a few nice things from John Minnelli.  So I reached out to him.  I said, thank you.  Judd said, you're welcome.  I said, all right.  Hope you're doing well.  Has Alan Sniffin revamped the site at all?  Does it look any different?  No, it's exactly the same.  It did in 1998?  Yeah, yeah.  It's exactly the same. 
[01:13:00]  It's amazing.  He's got his little niche.  Look, it's exactly the same.  Holy shit.  It's exactly.  That has not been updated at all.  The same colors, black, white, and fucking yellow.  That's exactly how it looked when we were at WNEW, right?  Even the subjects.  Oh, it's the same subjects.  They could be the same subjects from 10 years ago.  That's hilarious.  Radio's dead.  Radio's in trouble.  What are some of the topics on the New York Radio?  Where's the thread that still says,  Yo, ONA, fucking not going to be around on the air. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  There could be a flash in the pan.  Done.  I give them two years tops in this city.  They can't make it here.  New York Radio.  Now we're the old guard.  I know.  We're one of the oldest radio shows now.  Yes.  I was thinking about that this morning.  I'm like, holy fuck.  Howard Stern.  Us.  Yeah.  Imus.  Yeah.  And then some dumb morning zoos, I guess.  But that's about it.  That's about it.  Everyone else is long gone. 
[01:14:00]  Wayside.  You know, bitching about us somewhere.  Go fuck yourselves.  What are some of the topics on the New York Radio message board?  Christmas songs on now.  People very upset.  Or saying it's very good.  What every year?  Do you think they start the Christmas songs a little too early?  Discuss.  Discuss.  Go ahead.  New York Radio is the Midwest.  I don't know.  Being very critical of New York radios.  Or the Midwest.  Yes.  Okay.  What else?  What else? 
[01:14:30]  Lipa News Conference.  Not on WINS or WCBS.  Damn.  That could be a problem.  That's our power authority here.  I want to comment on that.  All right.  Fuck it.  It's not going anywhere.  So anyway.  So Aerosmith.  Yeah.  The Aerosmith.  See, I'll say it both ways.  Tomato, tomato, right?  Exactly.  They're not talking to each other.  The album's tanking.  And none of their dates have sold out.  Yeah.  Their work tour hasn't sold out. 
[01:15:00]  Yikes.  Well, you know what?  I think we were reading some of their fucking commercials.  We don't have to read their dumb commercials anymore.  No.  For their stupid album.  I think that's done.  And I used to like Aerosmith.  And Stephen Tyler used to do our show.  And we got along.  But somewhere along the line, he just became way too big for us.  Which happens.  I get it.  Yeah.  But he was pretty huge when he was doing our show.  Yeah.  Totally huge.  But this is what happened with this thing.  They just threw this shit together.  Obviously.  Stephen Tyler was done with his, what was he on? 
[01:15:30]  The American Idol?  Yeah.  I get them all confused.  And I'm telling the truth.  That stint hurt him.  So he.  For credibility as a band.  But he did it for a couple of years.  And he's like, all right, now what?  So he's like, I might as well go back to my band that I don't get along with.  Yeah.  And supposedly, according to the paper, they don't talk to each other at all.  That's great.  And it's obvious to me, as a guy that likes music, that they just kind of threw that album  together.  Mm-hmm.  Right?  Yeah.  What's the hit off that?  I mean, there's a hit or single. 
[01:16:00]  Let's go with the single.  What's the single?  It was the one, I remember we played it and we were kind of cringing, like, hmm.  Right.  What is it?  I don't remember what the name of it is, but we, I mean, we have it.  We're Back and Better Than Ever?  I think that's what it was, yeah.  Yeah.  It's a good one.  Love Her A Lot.  Well, let me hear that quickly.  Yeah.  Love Her A Lot is the single.  Please.  Quickly.  If, if we can, please.  Or we'll talk about fucking years ago. 
[01:16:30]  See?  See, it's just there.  All right.  That's all I need to hear.  Now I go to Anthony.  Like, what is that song missing?  It sounds like Aerosmith.  Yeah.  It has the sound, but gives a fuck. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  Is it too simple or something?  Yeah, it is pretty simple, but.  Do you want the Carrie Underwood duet?  Oh, give us your dirty looks like you do every day!  I'm calling out everyone, Sam.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah?  Fuck yeah.  Who gave you dirty looks?  Which one gives a dirty look?  That's stupid Lisa G from Howard's channel.  She gives you dirty looks?  Fuck yeah.  We never did shit to you.  Relax.  You can say hi.  She's always nice to me.  Do you know I don't know anybody? 
[01:17:30]  I honestly, I gotta swear to you, when she walks by, I couldn't have told you who she  is.  When I see people even in the elevator and stuff, and then later on I find out they're  some guy from Howard's show or this one from the, I don't know who they are.  You know who I know?  I know Fred.  Right.  I know Gary.  Right.  I know Robin.  Right.  Because I see them occasionally in the elevator.  Right.  Fred a lot.  Right.  Other than that, I don't know one fucking person from that show or the people in the  hallway.  I couldn't tell you who they are. 
[01:18:00]  I know the one chick from Shade that used to be on The Real World.  Right.  Right.  She, she.  I know Sway.  She'd turn around because she.  Who kid?  She finally says hi.  Good.  So we're good.  No, with the Howard thing, it's really simple.  We never did shit to stupid Lisa G, so relax and say hi.  What happens is there's some people that work for Howard's show that feel like, oh, obviously  they have beef with Howard, so I gotta, I gotta make sure I never say hi.  I don't say hi to those guys ever.  And then you got the guys that work for Howard's channel, and this is my fucking thing on this. 
[01:18:30]  They're like, hey, they seem like cool guys.  And they say hi to us, and we actually do talk in the hallways.  Yeah.  Because they're, because they're their own person.  They're like, I never officially had a problem with Opie and Anthony.  Yes, I worked for the other guy where there were major problems off and on and continue  in some extent, but that's not, I'm not a part of that.  So I'm going to talk to them.  Here's how I talk to a lot of the Howard Stern guys, and a lot of them, I don't, and  I'm not even going to mention names, because I don't want to put them in a tough spot, I  guess. 
[01:19:00]  And they're cool.  They're cool as hell.  This is how I see it in this building.  This is like my, my logic with everybody.  I mean, everybody.  There are a couple of people that I fucking can't stand in here because it carries over  from like the NEW days.  There's that one cocksucker that walks around.  I don't even want to get into it.  But that guy.  He's a cocksucker.  Yeah, he's an asshole.  I'll never fuck it.  But here's my.  I told him to his face, by the way.  Yeah, he's a dick.  I go, don't, don't ever say hi to me or look at me.  Because me and Ant know exactly what the fuck you did back at NEW. 
[01:19:30]  Here's my take, though.  I think I can pull off not being angry with people for four hours a day, especially based  on the fact that I really don't have any type of intimate relationship with the people  I see in the hallway.  I know people have problems with us.  We have problems with people.  Wait, wait.  I don't understand.  But it doesn't get to the point.  Like, I don't care.  I like her dumpy little ass.  No.  There's something just, I don't know why.  She's a lesbian.  You think?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:20:00]  She works for, um.  Don't say it, because I just said something that could get me in trouble.  See, right now she's nameless facing.  I don't know.  She walks around.  I could say this.  Eh, dumpy ass.  Any girl that wears hoodies every single day.  Yeah?  Lesbian?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Positive.  Yeah, it's a.  Oh, the anger is fake anger for the dumb show.  No, it really is.  I don't give a fuck.  But I don't like what that represents, though.  Yeah.  Because I've never done anything to her.  But she has to play that fucking role.  Well, fuck her. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, which people feel like they have to play.  My point being that there's a lot of guys that do work for Howard that are very cool that  aren't involved with that nonsense.  Yeah.  You know what?  I'll probably blow up his spot, but I'm going to say it.  You know who I get along with really well?  Ronnie the limo driver.  Oh, yeah?  He couldn't be cooler to me.  Yeah?  We ride up the elevator a lot.  We walk to the cars together a lot.  You know what's amazing?  He couldn't be nicer to me. 
[01:21:00]  Now, let me give you the contrast to that.  Yes.  I couldn't point him out in a lineup.  I don't even know what he looks like.  I honestly don't even know what he looks like.  Come on.  I swear to you.  Wow, that's so weird to me.  Why?  If you pointed someone out and said, who is that?  And it was Ronnie the limo driver.  Dude.  I couldn't tell you.  And I swear to you on that.  If we put our brains together, we would have a super brain.  Super human.  Because the part of my brain works really well that doesn't work well in you. 
[01:21:30]  Does that make sense?  Yeah, yeah.  Because you'll remember some dumb fucking commercial jingle from 75, but you don't know who Ronnie the limo driver is at this point?  I'd point him out in a two-person lineup.  But then again, you'd look at me and go, well, why don't you know the jingle from 1975?  So I'm not questioning you.  Yeah.  But you don't even know what he looks like.  Someone goes, Denver Pest, great, a racist super brain that shits on the beach.  Yeah, that's probably how we use our super brain.  No, we got to shit on the beach first, and then maybe we can figure out the fucking black hole thing. 
[01:22:00]  No, I mean, I have very good conversations with him, and probably now that'll stop because I'm bringing it up on the show.  So be it.  But it hammers my point home.  Yeah.  These guys are their own people, and we'll fucking, if they feel like, hey, you know, that's a guy I want to talk to or have a cool conversation with, they will.  They're not worried about what that means in the fucking scope of things, I guess.  I don't know.  I just, I don't really have the energy to have genuine anger with people in the hallways and stuff. 
[01:22:30]  Oh, that wasn't real anger.  No, no, I know.  It was more like, you know, relax.  You can say hi.  Do you say hi to the gay guys from the next station?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Got no problem.  It's awkward every single time, but.  Is it?  I don't know why, too, yeah.  Yeah, I got no problem with them.  It's maybe because I'm trying too hard to say, look, I'm cool with the gay.  You know what I mean?  Through just the how do you do.  Right.  You wanted so much information to go by.  Look, I know our reputation is that we should hate the gays and stuff, but we don't. 
[01:23:00]  Well, actually, you know, I support the gay.  I kind of like you two cocksuckers.  Right.  That all goes on as we're passing down the long hallway.  Yes.  I know it does.  There's a lot of transfer of information there.  Instead of just being cool and like, hey, what's up?  I know there's a whole thing.  Like, you know, I want to make sure they know I'm all right with the gay.  Right.  You know what you do?  Do what I do.  When they pass by, you smack them on the ass.  They love that.  No, they're all right.  Those guys are. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, they're fine.  They're fine.  There aren't many people that I pass by here and go like, oh, no, no, no, not really.  I'm out of here so fast.  It doesn't even affect me.  Right.  So anyway, Bacon, Aerosmith, E-Rock.  You didn't say anything about E-Rock.  Oh, I was telling, I'll get to the E-Rock thing.  I was telling Ann, we just had bacon because I'm supporting the people that still don't have power from the Superstorm.  Through consumption of bacon.  Yeah, I said it a couple weeks ago. 
[01:24:00]  I will eat bacon on a regular basis until everyone in the area has their power back.  You know, the sacrifices.  Because you don't have power still, right?  I appreciate that.  It's amazing the sacrifices some people are willing to make.  See, Travis appreciates it, Sam Roberts.  That's not a sacrifice.  Because Sam looked at me, pretty much rolled his eyes.  That really?  Yeah, that's what I'm doing.  It's not a sacrifice.  What are you doing for the people that lost power?  Nothing.  What are you doing?  I guess I'm drinking water right now.  No pull-ups, that's for sure.  You can't just make it up now.  I went out of my way.  I'm not a bacon eater in general. 
[01:24:30]  Every once in a while, like a lot of people out there.  But I am consuming a lot of bacon until the people get their power back.  But bacon is delicious.  Yeah.  So it's just a treat for yourself.  Yeah.  That's why I only have it every once in a while.  Because I know it's bad for you.  But I know that this means a lot to people.  So in your mind, you're thinking that the people with no power will feel better because they  know that somewhere, Opie may be enjoying himself with some bacon.  Hey, you know, people put on charity softball games, and playing softball is fun.  It's a game. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  So eating bacon is enjoyable and stuff.  Why can't you do that?  That's me acknowledging that.  Right.  People are in a tough spot right now.  Generally.  All those concerts, they love to play.  Right.  You're so cynical.  Travis, do you appreciate that I'm eating bacon because people still don't have power?  I do.  I walked in and I felt better about myself.  A lot of times.  And Travis, what did you say when you walked in?  Like, holy fuck.  Because you saw what me and Ant were eating, and you're like, you guys don't eat like that  usually.  And I said, I'm doing this for you, Travis.  I'm doing this for you.  Right.  I felt better inside.  A lot of times, concerts and softball games, they get money. 
[01:25:30]  And then that's the charity part.  Oh, so the guy playing third is getting money for it?  What?  The charity.  Well, it'll be as bringing attention to the problem.  And because I'm bringing attention, other people are bringing attention by doing their  part.  Through bacon.  Maybe they might have some poached eggs.  No, they're probably actually bringing supplies and working their balls off.  But you're just going to go with the bacon?  Yeah, because that's getting people to think about it.  And then they do what they need to do.  So that way...  It works, trust me.  You get a little of the credit.  I figured this out a long time ago.  For the working the balls off, and all you have to do is eat some bacon.  Me and Ant do a lot of charity. 
[01:26:00]  You just don't know about it.  I'm going to be very charitable this weekend myself.  Yep.  I'm heading down to the ravaged Atlantic City and try to take some of their money away  from their casino.  Yes, the Borgata.  So you won't be going towards the shore?  No.  No.  No.  I probably won't even see the outside.  I will see the inside of a limo.  I will see the inside of my room.  I will see the inside of the casino.  Back to the limo.  Back home.  They're desperate for people... 
[01:26:30]  Totally.  Which means if they ever...  You know, people wonder if they fix games.  Oh, boy.  If they're desperate for people to go to the casinos, and that is a real thing,  no one's winning this weekend.  No one's going away a winner, man.  No one's winning this weekend.  That's right.  Blackjack!  Yeah, I'm so psyched.  I told Ant, you know, we ate bacon.  I go to the bathroom.  I come back.  I go, I immediately feel like shit when I eat bacon.  I think it's a psychological thing, too, because you know it's just not good for you. 
[01:27:00]  I just had some, too, and I don't feel very good about myself.  I feel greasy.  Yeah.  My health didn't just drop immediately because I eat bacon.  My health is what it is.  I think I'm going to do what my ex has taught me.  I'm going to put my fingers down my throat and puke to keep myself skinny.  Wow, which ex was that one?  I don't know.  Maybe one that needs it for a job.  I don't know.  Wow.  Where did that come from?  I don't know.  What?  Wow.  She's talking experiences.  Bleh. 
[01:27:30]  Bleh.  Like fucking Costanza.  Fucking going to the bathroom and hear the noise.  Wow.  When you hear the noise?  No, no, no.  I don't know what the hell she was doing.  I'm just kind of joking, but not joking, because how the fuck do you just stay that skinny?  Did you see the watery eyes?  Oh, that's a good one.  I didn't notice what it was.  The smell of bile?  Watery eyes could have been from just being upset for no apparent reason at all.  And then being happy the split second later and then being upset again. 
[01:28:00]  Hmm.  Yeah.  Sounds like an emotional roller coaster.  Oh, boy.  Roller coaster.  Ba-da-dum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum.  Yes.  Ba-da-dum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum.  Ba-da-dum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum.  Well, a lot of ups and downs.  Yeah.  Mostly ups.  Apparently she just auditioned for Jim Jeffries' program.  Huh.  His show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Yeah, I know.  Hey, good luck.  Yeah.  Hope Jeffries got to deal with that in some way, shape, or form. 
[01:28:30]  You hope you said?  Yeah.  That'd be great.  Don't you like Jim Jeffries?  Oh, fuck.  What the fuck's wrong with that girl?  It's fucking crazy.  Yes, Jim.  It's fucking crazy.  Wow.  Thank you, Kevin, from Connecticut.  Ebony Eyes.  Ba-da-dum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum.  Wow, yeah.  I didn't even get that.  I said watery eyes.  Oh.  It got nothing, so then I decided to do the riff, hoping that I had a moment on the show.  Ba-da-dum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum. 
[01:29:00]  Oh.  What is this?  Ebony Eyes?  Oh, no.  No?  Travis.  Travis.  Sal told me to do it.  I know that's not true.  Good.  I like that.  That can be the go-to answer.  God, Travis.  Yeah, but the bacon made me feel like shit immediately.  Yeah.  I feel greasy.  I feel like I need a shower.  Ugh.  And there's guys listening right now that do this every day.  How do you do that? 
[01:29:30]  You have to condition yourself.  Well, that's why I don't eat, like, shit all the time, because when I do,  it's very noticeable, and then I move back to just eating, you know, as healthy as I can.  But then the other way, if you eat a dumb salad with maybe just a little dressing,  you feel way healthier all of a sudden, immediately.  You're not.  No.  So you're right.  It's psychological.  Yes, Bob Welch.  It's psyche shit.  Come on.  Let's do this, Travis.  Ba-da-dum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum.  That was the next one on the list.  Oh.  But you know what?  I went with the most recognizable name. 
[01:30:00]  Who?  So I was like, the Everly Brothers.  I'm like, ah, that must be what they're doing.  Oh, God, no.  Where is it?  He's...  Oh.  There it is.  That sounds like the noise you made.  Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Exactly, it sounds like.  Here we go.  Right.  Well, have you seen that girl in the corner?  The pocket breaker out of the dreams. 
[01:30:30]  If I had what I'm made with the baby, I'd have to bring to your mind to the moon.  I'd have to bring to your mind.  Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do my их. 
[01:31:00]  Nice.  Woo.  Like a little tootly-doo during the afternoon or morning or whatever the fuck it is.  Oh, so the E-Rock thing.  Yeah.  And I hate to do this because he's not here, but I got another vague fucking text.  Vague E-Rock text?  Vague E-Rock text.  Was it, could I ask you a question?  Or, you want to know something?  I hate those!  Don't text me that, people!  You know what?  Got a minute?  What?  Just respond, no. 
[01:31:30]  You know what?  People seem to like reality shit, so I'm going to read.  More reality?  I went back and forth with them.  There'll be some honesty in here as well.  Ooh.  I go, uh...  What, you call him fat?  That's honest.  Uh-oh.  Dinosaur.  Oh, I can't say.  E-Rock's a dinosaur.  You can say it.  I'll just say this.  You can say what he said.  All right.  Okay.  It's no big deal.  It's public lives here.  We live our lives publicly.  It really is.  We do put it out there. 
[01:32:00]  All right.  What about the shit aunt just said?  We live our lives very publicly.  All right.  You know what?  I'll do it this way.  I'll do it this way, because it is safe.  I wrote E-Rock, because I noticed something during this week of radio.  What was it?  Just noticed something.  Weight gain?  A lot of people will pick up on it.  I go, you like that?  Smiley face.  He wrote, very much.  Is this sexual?  Ooh.  Sexting with the...  Yeah.  Is this a sexual?  Bageling with the sexting.  Was it a cockpit to start?  I go, you like that?  Smiley face.  He goes, very much. 
[01:32:30]  I go, I saw you loving it, and that egged me on.  And then he writes, I dislike him.  Oh.  All right.  Who do you think it is?  Someone was getting a pounding.  And you and E-Rock were talking about it.  E-Rock loved it.  No, I saw that he was loving it.  So that egged me on when I realize someone is really enjoying when I'm getting people uncomfortable. 
[01:33:00]  So then it makes me go even harder.  Is it somebody who works here?  Like Mars did the other day with somebody as well.  Yeah?  Yeah.  When I was beating, not beating up, but going pretty crazy with that psychologist brought  from Porter's.  Oh, right.  Mars was outside the studio fucking dying.  I'm like, oh, okay.  And I went, I kept going with it.  Was the E-Rock thing someone who works here?  I'm not saying.  Is it Sal?  I'm not saying.  Okay.  It's Sal.  You think Sal, right?  That's exactly what I thought, too.  E-Rock would fucking just love watching Sal get fucking pounded.  How come you can't say that E-Rock enjoyed something? 
[01:33:30]  I'm not saying.  It'll be up to him to say.  Is that Winnie Cooper?  Yeah, I interviewed her yesterday.  Wait, you did?  Oh, yeah.  Was she in here?  Yeah, in the afternoon.  How'd she look?  Smoking.  Fucking Winnie Cooper.  Where's Winnie Cooper?  She's going to be on the Sam Roberts show this Sunday.  Oh.  Recorded.  Did she just walk by?  I mean, who's going to come in on a Sunday except for me?  Am I dumbass?  Did she just walk by?  No, I saw her on, she's going to be on Fox.  Okay.  So, he liked that very much.  I saw you loving it and that egged me on. 
[01:34:00]  Okay.  And then I wrote, yesterday, all my troubles seem so far away.  I wrote, thanks for my Chris Tucker picture.  Chris Tucker was boring, by the way.  Why would you just add that?  He kind of stepped into a Penn Gillette shitstorm.  I have a friend.  Oh, man.  Wow, wait.  Yeah, she's...  Did you finger her?  No, I didn't get a chance.  Did you finger her?  My goodness.  How does she look so good?  That show was...  I know she was young on the show, but that show was so long ago. 
[01:34:30]  How old is Winnie Cooper now?  She was actually three when that show was on.  Oh, okay.  She played older.  That makes sense.  Oh.  Yeah.  That show was in the 80s, by the way.  Where's that picture so people can see what Winnie Cooper...  89?  I'll put it on my Instagram in a second.  I'm not saying.  She was born...  It was...  The show was...  I don't know.  I remember being a kid.  88.  88?  Yeah, I remember being a kid when that show was on.  And she's 37.  She's 37.  Yeah, that's about right.  She's 37? 
[01:35:00]  She looks exactly the same.  She looks the same.  Isn't she like a math genius or something?  Yes, we all know that.  Right.  I talked to her about...  No, the Wonder Years still holds up.  She's a brainiac.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I talked to her about math and the Wonder Years and all that.  It's coming up this Sunday.  What time?  4 p.m. Eastern.  What do you do with a math brain?  Ha, ha, ha.  Let me tell you.  But really.  Put that dick in it.  But if that's Sunday, how do I round out my SiriusXM experience maybe on a Saturday?  No, no. 
[01:35:30]  That's where I'm getting to.  Oh.  I got this.  All right.  I got this.  All right.  This is the only reason I brought up the EROC text messages.  I got this.  It's just going a little slower than I would like.  I like EROC.  Yes.  So I wrote, thanks for my Chris Tucker picture.  He goes, and here's the, not vague, but this is EROC.  N.P.  So I write.  And then I, you know what?  I hate to read this, but this is some of the shit that does go on behind the scenes.  So fuck it.  I go, thanks for being a good sport today. 
[01:36:00]  It really was funny radio.  I know that wasn't easy.  See?  See?  Mm-hmm.  That's Greg Hughes right there.  Yeah.  You got a little fucking glimpse of Greg Hughes.  You're the one that did it.  I know.  That's why it's so weird to him.  So then he writes, four days is a new record.  And I go, and then I didn't write anything.  So he goes, oh, brutality.  He's trying to engage me.  So I write, let's go for five. 
[01:36:30]  Uh-huh.  He goes, have fun with that.  I'll hear about it in December.  So then I wrote question mark.  And he writes, I'm done till then.  I didn't know.  He was taking about two and a half weeks off or whatever the fuck it is.  It's crazy.  And then I write, damn it.  With a lot of exclamation points.  Like, fuck.  I want to abuse you another day.  And he writes, vacation time.  And of course they go, where are you going?  He never answers that.  No.  He never answers that.  But then this is where it gets vague.  He writes, but.  Yeah, I want that to sit there. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, no.  Because that's what I was thinking.  He just wrote, but.  Right.  To my question, where are you going?  He doesn't answer that.  And then just writes, but.  Dot, dot, dot.  Just but.  That's the whole text?  Yes.  He sent the word but in a text B-U-T?  Yes.  Maybe it was a pick request.  You know how he is.  I wish that they still charged by the message.  Oh, my God.  He writes, but.  And I don't fucking.  I don't go for that. 
[01:37:30]  No.  So I, like, put my phone down, whatever.  I'm done talking to you, Rock.  Fuck you.  I got a kid to watch anyway.  And then he knows that I didn't fucking bite.  So then, like, a few minutes later, he writes, Saturday, 6 to 7 p.m.  This goes to what you were about to mention.  If you'd like to stop by, my secret guest is a big fan of yours.  I guess E-Rock is having a secret guest during his Bagel in with the Sex.  That's his plan.  Oh, a secret guest.  He has a one-hour show. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  Tomorrow from 6 to 7 p.m.  Yeah.  And he's going to have a secret guest.  And he just writes, if you'd like to stop by, my secret guest is a big fan of yours.  And then he writes, you would find it interesting.  What a vague ass.  So then I write, who is it?  Yeah, you don't want to just show up blind.  What is a blind date?  Do you know what I would do?  I'm like, who is it?  I'll make believe that I didn't know.  Right.  I'm good at this shit.  I'll make believe.  Because you might not want to show up if they're a big fan.  It's going to be annoying.  Thank you. 
[01:38:30]  Or maybe I have plans.  Right.  You just go, hey, Opie, it's a surprise.  But I have whoever, Danica McKellar, is going to be on the show.  You should stop by.  Don't tell anybody.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Not like, let's look at the mystery.  What is he running a fucking game show?  We said it before.  He hoards information.  Yes.  That's what I'm saying.  Like, there's no reason to keep it secret.  I can make believe it's secret if you need that for your dumb show.  Oh, E.  I'm a busy man.  I'm thinking about maybe going to Philly this weekend or maybe out to Long Island with 
[01:39:00]  the new kid because people still haven't seen the new kid yet.  But if it's something that might be cool, maybe I would stick around.  But he just, so he writes, you would find it interesting.  I write, who?  Yeah.  And then he writes, of course, not saying until I start this show.  He wants to keep it all mysterious.  What the fuck?  Doesn't he know it's just like a fun, goofy show?  You fell right into his trap.  He wanted you to say who.  No.  And then he says that. 
[01:39:30]  And then he wanted you to say, come on.  Looks great.  No, then I don't.  Wow.  That's her on the left in the red dress.  She's amazing.  You didn't finger her?  What's wrong with you?  I didn't get a chance.  I only had like 20 minutes.  Oh, sorry.  You should have comforted her about her brother being killed in Vietnam on that rock.  And then you could lean over and kiss her and fucking just shove your fucking digit  right in there.  Kevin Arnold was a little sick.  Well, yeah.  You picked that time to make out with her.  Great fucking time.  What are you kidding?  This is a perfect opportunity.  Smart kid.  Smart kid.  And then she had to go back into the sad house. 
[01:40:00]  See, I watched the show.  Oh, yeah.  Remember the end of the episode?  I think that was the first episode, wasn't it?  Yeah.  I think that was like the pilot.  They kissed at the end of the first episode.  Yeah.  But then like he walked her home and then it was kind of a happy day because they had  a little moment as little almost teenagers or teenagers.  And then she had to, I remember she had to walk into the sad house.  The death house.  And as a kid, I sort of related.  I love that that's serious.  When I was outside the house, it wasn't as sad as inside the house.  I love that it didn't end the way it should have.  Yeah. 
[01:40:30]  It didn't have the happy ending.  No.  Which is good.  Not every TV show should.  You know the chick that played Becky?  You remember Becky, the girl that Kevin Arnold kind of starts dating to get Winnie Cooper  mad?  Punch it up, motherfucker.  I don't remember Becky.  Punch up her fucking face.  That's probably when the show jumped the shark.  No.  I don't remember no Becky.  It hadn't jumped the shark yet.  No.  The show jumped the shark when it started talking like this.  Hi, I'm Kevin Arnold.  How bad did you want to bang his older sister, though?  Oh, my God.  Remember her?  Diablo.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:41:00]  No, we don't care about her anymore.  We want to look at the older sister.  That's real life.  That's Winnie Cooper's sister.  I could see it.  IRL.  I could see it.  Tidbits like that and more this Sunday.  Go work for Nickelodeon.  Nickelodeon.  Give me Kevin Arnold's older sister that I wanted to bang so bad.  Olivia Diabo.  Even though I don't think my penis was working yet.  I was too small.  She looked good back then.  She looked great in Conan.  She was in one of the Conan movies.  And she was wearing a real, like, revealing fucking thing. 
[01:41:30]  And then remember, she talked on talk shows and she has, like, a deep English accent.  Yeah, she's very English.  No, man.  Pictures from the show.  When she was just a regular girl.  The older sister.  That was sort of...  Put fucking...  No, not that.  Put it from Conan.  Come on.  Just for pictures from the show.  Just put Conan.  How about you just find one hot picture?  And we'll be satisfied.  There you go.  Now you're going to see her in a fucking great Conan the Destroyer.  Not that one.  Yeah, there you go.  Yeah?  Let me see that one.  Maybe a little titty shot there. 
[01:42:00]  I don't know.  That's great.  See, you always pick the worst picture.  You just picked that one.  I didn't pick that one.  The show did.  All right.  What about she's laying...  There's some titties.  Yeah.  They're talking.  Oh, what's going on?  Oh, look at the little nipple right there.  Yeah.  She has those titties that were sitting really nice.  Anyway.  So then E-Rot goes...  Oh, put on Bolero.  B-O-L-E-R-O.  Olivia...  Oh, Jesus.  You suck.  God damn it. 
[01:42:30]  Time, you mean?  Sam.  You mean time?  Oh, God.  That's her.  Now we got an older picture of her.  Well, the problem is she did that Botox shit.  She did.  Stop with that, ladies.  They don't have that shit figured out.  Oh.  Put Bolero in.  Put Olivia Delbo...  Bolero.  Bolero.  Someone's saying these are the best.  All right.  All right.  Let's...  Let's take a look at Kevin Arnold's older sister from the other years.  Oh, man.  Iraq party, nigga.  Or army. 
[01:43:00]  Will you fucking blow that shit up?  It's blown up.  No, it's not.  That's blown up.  Keep going.  Click.  Keep going.  Click it.  It's not going to blow up again.  I have to take her here.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, man.  Is she completely naked?  Now blow up.  Is that frontal nudity?  By Kevin Arnold's older sister?  Oh, man.  Look at that.  Oh.  Smoking.  Look at her tits.  Nice.  Come on, everyone.  Look.  Wow.  Stop the show.  Anyway, that's a good one.  Thank you for that.  All right.  We'll move on.  You're welcome.  So then Iraq writes, you would find it interesting. 
[01:43:30]  I wrote who?  He writes, not saying until I start the show.  And then he has to do this.  You know of this person, but have never met.  Oh, my.  What is this?  What is this?  The Q of the D?  It's a game show.  Does he have a mustache?  Yeah.  Will I get a fucking prize if I guess?  Iraq's such a fucking hack.  He learned all his shit from fucking Scott Shannon.  That's a Scott Shannon thing.  Hey, you know this person, but you never met. 
[01:44:00]  I got a tree on my house.  See, in the end now, I mean, I'm getting a lot of people to tune into his show tomorrow  from 6 to 7, because now I've made it a thing.  Now it's a bit.  It's probably just his nephew.  Big fan.  But who could it be?  His mystery guest is a big fan of mine.  I've never met him.  You know of this person, but I've never met.  Who can it be now?  You play that over and over.  You loop the chorus for the fucking cheesy radio show.  Who can it be?  All right.  We're going to guess who this is.  Well, without a doubt, be a letdown. 
[01:44:30]  You've met.  You haven't met.  But you know of this person.  They're a big fan.  Right.  And they're going to be on Bagelum with the Sun.  Yeah, Iraq doesn't understand that.  Sam's right.  In the end, it'll be a massive letdown.  Yes.  Because he's building it up way too much.  Yep.  A surprise guest.  Unless he's bringing fucking Bono in here.  Or Mick Jagger.  Wow.  Who gives a fuck?  Yeah.  Like Ray Liotta would be a great surprise guest.  Hey, that's a biggie.  We met Ray Liotta.  Although we met.  Yeah.  He scared the shit out of me.  One of the few.  He was great. 
[01:45:00]  He actually looked at me and goes, what's wrong with him?  Are you sick?  Yeah.  He said, are you sick?  I'll be honest.  I was scared.  He's a weird fucking guy.  Yeah, he is.  That rarely happens.  But I remember going, wow, he's, wow.  I don't know what I was thinking.  Yeah.  It's his eyes.  It was his attitude.  It was just like, and he looks over.  It was one of those interviews.  I have a few where I just don't talk.  And he goes, is he sick? 
[01:45:30]  So you know of this person, but I've never met.  Oh, God.  And that was the end of it.  Because I was like, I'm not even writing you back.  You're exhausted.  That's narrowed down to just about 100% of the Hollywood community, music community.  I mean, we've met a few, but.  We're lucky to meet a lot of people.  So why would I come in on a Saturday?  Because he has a mystery guest that is a fan of mine that I've never met.  Why would I do that?  Mystery date.  And how awkward.  Who can it be now?  Oh, it's Kenny.  Who can it be now?  How awkward would it be? 
[01:46:00]  Who can it be, Opie?  If you walked in and you were just like, oh.  Oh, yeah.  Hey.  Like, it was just some comedian.  Shake hands.  Hi.  The person's like, Opie, man, I'm a big fan.  Can I get a picture?  And you're just like, I fucking came in for this.  Right.  For this.  Then I'm stuck.  Yeah.  Because Iraq doesn't know how to read shit.  No.  No, he's not a good host.  So he'll put me in a bad spot.  Not on purpose.  He just doesn't know better.  Did he ever wind up telling you who it is?  No.  I gave up.  I stopped talking to him.  What an asshole.  That song was right.  He is an asshole. 
[01:46:30]  I wrote who, and then there's three texts that don't answer my simple question of who.  Not saying until I start the show, you know of this person, but I've never met.  And then he goes, and then a few minutes go by, and then he finally writes, oh, no.  Hours went by.  Oh, okay.  Hours went by.  He must have been eating.  So that's how the conversation ended with him saying, you know of this person, but I've  never met, and I never wrote him back.  I'm like, I'm not playing this.  No.  I'm kind of old.  I don't need this shit anymore.  Fuck him.  I'm not a teenager.  Did he tell Sam?  Oh, please tell me. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, this is a good game.  No, you're going to have to wait.  You're going to have to wait.  Please.  So no one knows.  No.  Well, Roland just said that he believes Eric put his name in the security system, whoever  this guest is.  So Roland's now down finding out from security whose name's in the system.  Ah, very good.  Please, please have Roland blow up his spot.  Let's blow it.  Let's blow it up far.  You want to?  Fuck yeah.  Because it's his big get for his one-hour show tomorrow.  It's undermined Bagel-in with the Sex.  Yeah.  Let's announce his mystery guest.  I mean, I didn't have any problem announcing Danica McKellar, who's going to be on my show  Sunday at 4 p.m. Eastern on the channel. 
[01:47:30]  Why would you?  It's promoting.  Right.  And I just did it again.  So then I'm going to...  Yeah.  Six hours later, out of nowhere, he writes, throw an X-Factor.  Khloe Kardashian is wearing such tight pants.  Look how fucking huge she is.  He's trying to just bond with you.  I wrote on it, I wrote on it, and then don't write anything back because I'm looking at  Khloe Kardashian, who, she looked kind of good last night, to be honest with you.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  But nothing was going on.  And I'm like, you just made me watch the X-Factor. 
[01:48:00]  I'm not watching the X-Factor.  He loves pulling your strings like you're his puppet.  No shit.  He texts you and makes you do things.  And then he notices I'm not writing him back, like, with a big wow or like, holy shit,  you're right.  So then, of course, he has to backtrack because he thought it would be something that obviously  wasn't again.  So he writes, they're purposely cutting off her lower half.  They were doing that before.  They weren't doing that before.  How horrific was that?  He wants an answer.  How horrific was that?  Horrific.  And then it was nine o'clock, and I knew the Rolling Stones movie on HBO was starting, 
[01:48:30]  so I was done with E-Rock.  So I did give him a little, to be honest with you.  I wrote awful.  But you didn't believe it.  You just wanted him to stop talking.  Yeah, just stop.  Honest with you, no, I did not.  But I knew that would end the conversation.  Yeah.  She actually looked good.  Khloe Kardashian is not a bad-looking chick, to tell you the truth.  She looked good.  But she's a terrible host.  Yeah, they just wrote everything down for her aunt.  You could totally tell she has no personality.  She's just reading what they wrote her.  She's terrible.  She doesn't give a fuck about the votes or anything. 
[01:49:00]  No, Mario Lopez is not great on that show either.  That show should not have a host.  Why do they go host mid-season?  They'd start the host when the live shows start.  Oh, and they picked those two, huh?  Yeah, but they're terrible.  And then Britney Spears is all spaced out still.  She's horrible.  It was good to watch for a couple minutes.  I could give a shit.  That's my show, though.  The X Factor is my shit.  Fuck.  That young white girl, how's she doing?  She's still on.  She was second place yesterday to the country guy.  I know all this because he rocked for us.  Was that a Thanksgiving song, girl? 
[01:49:30]  No, that's not it.  Oh, no, please.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  We got to save it for Thanksgiving.  Giving.  Giving.  Giving.  It's Thanksgiving.  We, we, we were going to have a good time.  It's Thanksgiving.  This is what we're going to do.  We're going to take a break because I just got word that Guy Fieri is calling our show today.  Oh.  He's a big get.  The New York Times destroyed his Times Square restaurant.  Yeah. 
[01:50:00]  I have not eaten there.  People around here have eaten there.  And these people have told me off the record that it's wonderful.  Ah, see.  That's all I know.  So you think the guy had an agenda.  And so now Guy Fieri is all in and he's taking on The Critic.  And he was on, I think, the Today Show.  We got clips of that, right?  Mm-hmm.  We'll play that after the break.  And then he's going to call our show.  So, and not only is he calling our show, it's too bad I ate my bacon and eggs because  he's bringing a whole shitload of food here to go, really?  Is this food bad?  Is he bringing it or he's sending? 
[01:50:30]  He's sending it.  He's sending it.  And to be fair, I mean, I've heard the food at the restaurant is terrible.  So I don't know.  Whoa.  That's what I heard.  Sam has an agenda, too.  The Times.  The New York Times.  Sam has an agenda.  He doesn't like Guy Fieri.  I don't dislike him.  He apologized.  It doesn't matter.  You still hold a grudge.  I know you.  So you're a New York Times reader?  Yeah, I am.  I'm a big New York Times guy.  Yeah, I read the restaurant reviews.  That's how I know where to eat.  Newspapers.  Stop with the newspapers already.  Cares.  You want to make it official and stop reading newspapers for the radio show? 
[01:51:00]  Mine sit here.  The only time I pick up the newspaper is when Opie at the beginning, before the show even  starts, Opie's sitting over there with the newspaper.  I've got a lot of inside shit happening today.  Tell him what I tell you.  I fucking sit here with two newspapers that I never look at, and then Opie goes, holy shit,  dude, turn to page five.  This chick's smoking.  And then I'll go, oh shit, she's smoking.  I'm not looking for any news in the newspaper.  It's like, it's ridiculous. 
[01:51:30]  That's when you know we're guys in the end, because even when we're not getting along,  I'll still fucking go, hey, you gotta see page 12, man.  Holy fuck.  What's that?  Holy shit.  I know we're not getting along right now, but look at the tits of that girl.  It's hot.  Fuck.  Thank God for the newspaper.  But I also love that you've gone from like, you know, doing production and being here  all...  The newspaper is literally the last molecule of show prep that you guys do at all.  And I want it gone. 
[01:52:00]  And now you're suggesting no more newspapers.  It's gone.  It's more a, uh, just getting me into a routine to get ready for this horse shit.  You know what my show prep is, by the way?  Sam.  What?  Life.  Oh.  I live show prep.  Yeah.  My life is show prep.  You know, we just made up two hours of radio.  We weren't going to talk about any of this shit today.  Yeah, but you wouldn't have had that...  That's how good we are.  You wouldn't have had that Steven Tyler tidbit had it not been for the paper.  Oh, jeez. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, see, I got it out of the paper, though, quickly.  Right.  I heard rumors and stuff, and then I saw it in print.  Yeah.  Here comes the Guy Fieri food.  We're going to take a break.  Oh.  We're going to maybe eat some of Guy's food.  Oh, my God.  Wait, who's bringing it in?  That's the one I told you.  That's the girl.  Oh, she's going down the hall.  I don't think she is.  She's not.  She's not.  Oh, does she have a boyfriend?  Engaged.  She's engaged?  Oh, I was having some fucking, like, tagging that ass fantasies.  Roll it.  Oh, I mean, did you find out who the mystery guest is? 
[01:53:00]  Come on, please find out.  I have to find out, but there's a way, though, because...  Well, do it immediately before he fucks it up.  Find out.  I know, but I can until, like, in the half hour when that person comes in.  I can find out.  That person.  We've got to blow up his spot.  Oh, trust me, I'm all for it.  Roland's all in with blowing up someone's spot.  We've got to announce the mystery guest.  Well, through the town department, I'm using my evil ways.  Roland's doing his show before you rock this weekend at 5 p.m., and that's called The Food  Court, but he is... 
[01:53:30]  What a clusterfuck Roland's show is going to be.  He's completely...  He's going crazy booking everything imaginable.  Like, he's got, like, four guests, and he's got three different segments, and he's got  just, like, Jesus, how long is it?  An hour?  One hour.  52 minutes.  What is that?  Oh, Roland.  Can you explain to everyone how you take such beautiful Instagram pictures?  Sure.  I just literally walk and go, click, and then filter, filter, filter, post.  A lot of filtering.  Filter, filter, filter, filter, and post. 
[01:54:00]  All right.  We've got Guy Fieri's food, so we're going to break.  Why don't you set up a nice presentation for us?  You fucking...  All right.  What is that?  It looks like terrier.  Oh, General Tau's chicken.  What's up?  Wait, wait, wait.  Roland with food is great, man.  He's loving this.  What, General?  Tau's.  Oh.  Tau.  It sounded like toe, didn't it?  Tau.  Maybe spelled it.  Yeah.  All right.  What else you got there?  He's ripping the bags open.  Like Christmas. 
[01:54:30]  Like a pit bull.  You really should do a foodie show, man.  I watch every food court.  General who?  I guess he knows he does General...  This is Roland's.  What is that?  What is it?  Don't worry about it.  The Big Dipper?  Yeah.  Is that like a French dip, beef dip thingy?  Yes, it is.  Fuck, man.  That's pretty good.  Oh, another French dip?  Oh, that's righteous.  All right.  What else?  It's called the Guy's American The Big Dipper.  Is that what that is?  Wow.  This is the food that the New York Times says is the worst ever.  Guy's bacon, chicken, and mac and cheese. 
[01:55:00]  Hello, Roland.  Bacon, chicken, mac and cheese.  Roland's taking everything.  What is it called?  Bacon, chicken, mac and cheese.  Holy fuck, that sounds great.  That looks delicious.  You got your bacon part if you want to want it.  I got my boner.  Help out.  Maybe I'll bring that home for my young son.  My young son.  If there's left, I don't know.  Pork shank.  Yeah, General Taos.  A little bit of everything.  Asian, American, and a little comfort food.  All right, we're going to try it out.  Oh, hell yeah.  I'm ready.  And we're going to have Guy Fieri...  Oh, hell yeah.  Oh, hell yeah.  And we're going to have Guy Fieri defending his restaurant against the New York Times critic. 
[01:55:30]  That's a big get for us.  Stay there.  I sure hope you can repurpose this.  Are you going to repurpose a repurpose bit?  Or us discussing repurpose?  That would be some weird Matrix shit.  I'm purposed.  Repurposed.  Nice.  Nice.  Purposed.  Repurposed.  Nice.  What does that mean?  A new purpose?  But a repurpose means you're purposing it again.  A repurpose has a new purpose to what? 
[01:56:00]  Originally had a different purpose.  Purposed.  Repurposed.  Nice.  Purposed.  Repurposed.  Nice.  Weird Matrix shit.  A new purpose.  Weird Matrix shit.  A new purpose.  Weird Matrix shit.  A new purpose.  Wait.  All right, let's break it down.  Read it.  Read it.  So you use something, and then you reuse it.  So it's not a new purpose.  You're using it for the same shit.  Purpose is sounding weird now. 
[01:56:30]  Purposed.  Purposed.  Repurposed.  Nice.  Purposed.  Purposed.  Repurposed.  Nice.  Weird Matrix shit.  A new purpose.  Weird Matrix shit.  A new purpose.  Weird Matrix shit.  We're taking audio that at one point had a purpose,  and adding a new purpose to the same audio.  Now we're repurposing that same audio as to be a song.  Well, there you go.  There's the repurpose.  Repurpose.  Repurpose.  Repurpose.  Repurpose.  Serious.  Serious.  XM's. 
[01:57:00]  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  We got lots to do today.  We got Guy Fieri calling in.  He just sent over a shitload of food from his restaurant here in Times Square.  Captain Blood again.  Hey, my favorite one, baby.  How great is Austin Chains?  You know, I wasn't even listening.  Great shit. 
[01:57:30]  I like my Austin Chains, too.  That's good shit.  Guy Fieri.  You're going to try his food, Ed?  Yeah, I'm going to try this.  This is the food that the New York Times says is awful.  American dip thing he's got going here.  The Big Dipper.  So what do you do?  You dip it in the...  Yeah, it's like a beef dip.  You put it in the...  The saussier. 
[01:58:00]  I'm a saussier.  And now we take a little...  Wow, this is like real fucking morning show shit.  Oh, what do you think?  I want complete honesty, sir.  Anthony Cumia says, that's good shit.  Really?  Yes!  That's a pretty good goddamn beef dip.  Is there some horseradish sauce on there?  Yeah, I'm not a horseradish guy, though.  I'm more of an...  You put the two together.  What's wrong with you?  No.  Uh-uh.  Creamy horseradish or raw? 
[01:58:30]  A double dip.  Eat it raw.  No, I like the...  Raw horseradish or you like it all creamy and shit?  Whatever you got.  I just like a juicer.  When I go to the steak joints, I ask for raw horseradish.  Ooh.  And that's how I eat my steak a lot of times.  It's nice.  Nice combination.  Good, huh?  Mm.  These are the icons.  I'm down.  Roland, what did you eat?  I had the French dip.  It was delicious.  It's a mac and cheese.  That mac and cheese.  Could you save one for my young son? 
[01:59:00]  I'm bringing that home.  I don't know.  He doesn't give a fuck about his cholesterol.  It's delicious.  He'll eat that shit.  Imagine a kid that young just going, hi, I gotta watch what I eat.  It's a chicken mac and cheese.  It's really good.  No, but what's the real name?  It's a cool name even.  Guys, American, bacon, chicken, and mac and cheese.  Bacon, chicken, mac and cheese.  Bacon, chicken, mac and cheese.  I need a nap now.  It's only one ant.  No ant.  No.  Grab that fucking ass.  No.  It's all like sloppy.  Yeah, you know it smells though.  Nah.  You can tell.  Nah.  You can tell when an ass smells. 
[01:59:30]  She's a little sloppy.  She's engaged, huh?  Shut up.  Don't give away too much info.  I'm not fucking spending my Friday out of human resources.  Putting out fires?  Right.  Keep it vague.  Keep it vague.  Hey, you!  She was just passing by the office.  Why are you saying...  All right.  There's always some miserable asshole that needs to be heard.  Go ahead, miserable asshole.  What do you got today?  I'm not a miserable asshole.  You represent all the miserable assholes out there that just fucking have to find something  all the time. 
[02:00:00]  Oh, here he is.  Go ahead, Tim.  Say what you were going to say.  Go ahead.  Okay.  All right.  So you were teasing it saying the Guy Fieri interview was a big fucking get or whatever.  Yeah.  So while you're in commercial, I switch over to that shit show in New York.  Not Sam's show.  Thank you.  But a different show with Elvis Duran, I believe, teasing the shit.  Yo, Guy, what's up, buddy?  What's up, my brother?  We just tried your food here.  How'd you do?  It's really good. 
[02:00:30]  I am loving it.  I had the Big Dipper.  And it's fantastic.  That's right.  Oh, that's great news.  That's great news.  It's been a while.  I love how we're not good enough for, A, him to not be on the speakerphone.  Speakerphone.  Very echoey.  And, B, we're not good enough for his good cell phone.  What guy?  Wait a second.  That's my special interview.  Use some weird phone.  Someone sent me like this.  It sounds too much like a cell phone when you talk on your cell phone.  So use this.  Because the house phones don't work anymore. 
[02:01:00]  They're all cordless, wireless.  You know, there's no hard line phone anymore.  Does that sound better?  Yeah, that sounds a little better.  It was echoey.  Yeah, it was very echoey, like you were in your giant bathroom.  Well, actually, I am wandering around my kitchen.  It's five-something in the morning in California.  All right.  It's completely black and raining.  But thanks for having me.  And I'm glad you like the food.  I'm sorry I couldn't be there.  I had to bounce back to Cali.  I understand.  What time did you get up?  Bounce back to Cali.  About 4.30.  So you've been up an hour. 
[02:01:30]  How many times have you walked around your house and went,  Rock and roll!  I just picture you in your house, always just like,  Rock and roll!  To no one.  Maybe your dog.  Woo!  Or sometimes it just goes,  Woo!  Right.  Woo!  Right.  As the coffee's brewing.  Yeah.  Yeah!  Did I send drinks over there?  No, the only time you serve alcohol is when you're pouring it down Sam's throat.  I did stop by to say hi the other day. 
[02:02:00]  You guys had already bounced out of there.  Oh, yeah.  What was it?  10-0-1.  I figured you guys were, you know, sticking around, but I didn't know that you had a tea  time.  Never.  So, Guy, this fucking New York Times review, what are you saying about it?  Well, that's rough, man.  That was rough.  We think it's great.  I think it's great.  We think it's fucking great, and you should own it.  You should say, all right, he says this, but look, come down and you make up your own  mind.  I would fucking frame that in the restaurant.  I would put something outside saying, this asshole from the New York Times saying whatever 
[02:02:30]  he said that was bad.  You pick one of the many quotes he had, and then you go, come on in and try for yourself,  fuckers.  Yeah.  Something like that.  I think it would fly.  Well, I think you're right in that whole piece, and that's kind of what we did when I came  into town yesterday.  Listen, critics are critics, and they're going to have their opinion, and you can't stop  that.  But the one opinion I really care about is the fans, and are we doing it all perfect?  No.  We're in the restaurant business. 
[02:03:00]  I mean, we're striving to do it great.  We're striving to do it perfect, and we will get there.  Believe it or not, guys, we only had open two months as many times as I've been in the  show talking about it.  Hey, in the last two minutes, how many leg kicks did you just do while talking to us?  How many leg kicks?  Listen, I really think you guys have to do it.  Woo!  Woo!  The 151.  Just bring them down a little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  Sorry, guys.  Sorry.  It's Friday.  We're very excited that we're going to be starting our weekends.  Maybe we even go to your joint. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, hell yeah.  Maybe we even go there.  I've told you, when you guys want to come down, my team's waiting, man.  How about we want to have dinner with you and not your team?  You know we're big stars at this point, right?  What?  I will be back.  I'll be back in about a week and a half after Thanksgiving.  Did you say that while you were just fist-pumping the air?  Bah!  No, that was two leg kicks and a spin.  Rock and roll!  No!  Is your family sick of your antics?  Your antics?  They're asleep. 
[02:04:00]  They were asleep.  Are they?  They've got me doing a fist pump.  Yeah, yeah.  No, I mean, you know, I know a little bit about the restaurant industry, and you're always  trying to perfect your product.  And, you know, these reviewers could be complete assholes.  They could have an agenda, certainly.  I would imagine a guy that writes reviews for the New York Times isn't going to, your place  might not just be his cup of tea to begin with.  He's a stick in the mud is what he is.  Fuck him.  We went to go down and do Guys America, and I can see him being not so excited about that 
[02:04:30]  compared to some of the, you know, real nice, fine dining, high-end restaurants that are  typically reviewed, and that that might be something a little bit disappointing for him.  I mean, I don't know what was going on.  But, like I said, it's my food.  It's my team.  It's my place.  I stand by it.  Do we make mistakes?  Yes.  Could it be that every single thing he had was horrible that day?  I don't think that the odds are in that.  No, that's impossible.  The reality of it is, is you guys come down, check it out yourself.  You've had my food before.  You know what it's like. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, yeah.  Ant's eating it right now.  He's eating the Big Dipper as you talk.  It's not even a bit.  I don't have to be eating this.  It's fucking, it's sitting here, and it's very good.  You know what's amazing about Guy Fieri?  Guy Fieri, he could talk and stick his tongue out at the same time.  Woo-hoo!  I don't know where this is coming from.  Because you're a rock and roll chef.  You are a rock and roll chef.  Embrace it, my friend.  Embrace that shit.  Embrace it.  Embrace those flames.  Fucking flame paint on your spatula.  That's what I'm talking. 
[02:05:30]  That's right.  Rocking.  Or a spatula that looks like a guitar.  Wouldn't that be cool?  That would be cool.  It's painted up like a guitar.  And then you could like, in between flipping stuff, you grab it and go,  I just got like a Wayne's World thing there.  Yeah, a little bit.  We feel it.  We're feeling it today.  I say you take that New York Times writer, and you challenge him to an air guitar off.  Aw, shit.  At the restaurant, motherfuckers.  Woo!  I wish Guy would just say, fuck that New York Times guy. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  And call him a narc.  80s or something.  Hey, Guy, you're probably giving the same answer that you're giving every other media outlet.  How about you give us something different here?  Yeah, you say, fuck that New York Times restaurant reviewer.  You say it right now on our show.  Fucking square peg.  Let's do this.  Hey, listen.  I'm going to tell you this.  Yeah.  This is not my...  I'm not even into this energy.  Really, and I'm being very honest with you.  Yeah.  I don't get into negative stuff.  Hells no.  I don't have time for it. 
[02:06:30]  This was something, and as a matter of fact, until it got so blown out of proportion, where  it started getting run as headline news, I mean, I'm like, let it go, everybody.  It's a goddamn review.  I know, right?  You know, there's not been any major catastrophe here.  We've got bigger issues to focus on in this world, goddammit.  Exactly.  Everybody wants to get so excited about it.  So, listen, this is the end of it.  I just am bummed I didn't get a chance to come and hang with you guys.  It would have been fucking great.  We do love when you're here, man. 
[02:07:00]  Hey, do you say...  You know what you should serve?  Rock lobster.  Like R-A-W-K lobster.  God, I don't know what strain you got on.  And a roll.  We want food that rolls.  And it comes with a roll, so you can rock and roll.  Nice.  All right, so you want a whole rock menu?  That's fine.  Yes!  I'm going to lock this down.  Don't be playing around now.  Now, do you want a rock menu?  Okay, we'll go work on a rock menu.  Yeah.  Put a rock in your soup, man. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah!  Pew, pew!  Well, listen, you guys tell me...  Rolling stone clams or something?  When I come back, I would love to have dinner with you and sit there and...  Oh, no, you remember when you're supposed to fly...  No, you're supposed to fly us out on your private plane for a little Napa shit.  Private plane!  I didn't forget.  Ooh, have you seen?  We've disguised my private plane as Southwest.  I'll be...  Yes!  It's a big one.  Bring a bunch of your friends.  All right.  I like that pick.  It's like, yeah, it's a sandwich!  Damn.  Hey, guy, my restaurant is expanding. 
[02:08:00]  Just wanted to brag a little bit.  And it should?  FH, we finally got the go-ahead.  We were dealing with some red tape out there in Huntington.  Yeah.  And we finally...  Did I tell you even?  Putting a smoke machine and stage lights in?  That's right!  Rock and roll!  Woo!  So we're finally expanding.  We've been waiting a long time for them to give us the go-ahead.  And I'm proud to say my brother's restaurant, FH Riley's, out there in Huntington is expanding.  Oh, we're very happy.  How many square feet did it start with?  Huh?  How many square feet was it at the beginning? 
[02:08:30]  About 220.  That's it?  Really?  220?  Is it a takeout counter?  Yeah.  That's for like a...  We're going to go to about 400.  Really?  400?  When you make square footage, it really cuts down quickly on the size.  I have a confession.  I never understood that square foot shit.  Like, if you ask me how many square feet my home is, I'll tell you it's a four-bedroom.  Length by width?  I don't know.  Length by width?  I don't know.  Length by width?  I can tell you by rooms.  It's like the bar area is roomy, and then the dining hall is even roomier. 
[02:09:00]  I like saying how many cubic feet my house is, because I've got high ceilings.  It makes it sound better.  Very well said.  That's why guys are bad at math.  Exactly.  How's business at the restaurant?  Are you doing all right in general?  We were slamming yesterday.  We had a great day, and it was funny.  I ran into all kinds of buddies that were in town or from out of town that just happened  to be coming through.  So it was a good day.  It was good, positive energy. 
[02:09:30]  And I think that's what's going to continue.  It was ironic.  Look, we had, while this was all going down, we had a big party that was hosted by the  New York Times down in the banquet room.  What?  No.  That was pretty...  Oh, no kidding.  Wait, wait, wait.  The reviewer kills your restaurant, but then the New York Times themselves were there for  a big party.  Yeah.  Come on.  Is that possible?  Maybe he's the asshole of the paper, and no one even likes him.  And, you know, that happens.  We've got those people around here.  Wow. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Don't invite him to the party.  So it's been...  And like I said, we're just, you know, we just continue to work, man.  Just continue.  We had big meetings yesterday.  Went through food.  Tasted food.  The question was, you know, do you taste your food?  Of course I taste my food.  I mean, this is what all I do.  And don't do it.  It's kind of like your kid striking out at P-ball, you know.  You're a little league.  I mean, you can't strike out at P-ball, I guess.  But, you know, it's heartbreaking.  But you pick it up, you go back after it, you handle it again the next day, and some 
[02:10:30]  of the food that you're trying there is just, you know, just an example of what we do.  I mean, it's just great flavor, big food.  Yep.  You know, unique styles, and hopefully a good party.  Rock and roll.  Yeah.  Rock and roll.  Rock and roll.  That was good.  All right.  That's good, guy.  Now we're learning.  Keep the positive energy.  Keep rocking.  Keep the fist pumping.  Fucking great, man.  That's right.  Hey, what kind of music you got in your restaurant while you were eating? 
[02:11:00]  Hey, great music.  You know, that is one of the things.  You will not hear the elevator music program going, and I was standing in there, and I  think there was a little, I think it was, I don't know, Def Leppard, Sammy Hagar, some  80s band.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  All right.  In the midst of all the craziness going on, and I'm like, all right, that works.  You should have Sammy Bergar.  The polka player?  No, man.  That's the name of your burger.  No, like a burger.  It's the Sammy Bergar, but you say it like Bergar, because of Hagar. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  Do you honestly have Motley Q ribs?  That's the name of my barbecue team.  Motley Q.  Q-U-E.  Not Cruz.  Right.  Motley Q is the barbecue.  Oh, man.  What kind of...  We've got a great barbecue team, man.  We won some national competitions, and so I just give a little homage to my boys that  are out there, you know, competing almost every weekend.  Yeah.  And then the ribs are...  I mean, the ribs are the bomb.  You've got to see.  We've got to smoke.  I mean, we have the real deal good.  Yeah.  We've got a fantastic smoker from Southern Pride. 
[02:12:00]  We've got this big woodstone rotisserie.  Rotisserie, the chicken's right there in the dining room.  Nice.  I mean, it is...  When I got my wish list of what I wanted for kitchen equipment, I got it.  Do you have bat-out-of-hell meatloaf?  No, no, but that's good.  That would be good.  I kind of like that.  Do you have pizza?  No pizza.  No pizza.  That was...  Oh, no, no, no, no.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  What happened?  You didn't really hang up on it.  Oh, no.  I like pizza. 
[02:12:30]  I didn't see that.  But I like pizza.  Oh, you can usually see it coming.  But I like pizza.  Do you know you were already...  I like pizza.  His food's delicious without pizza.  But I like pizza.  Did he hang up on it?  I don't have the phone screen in front of me.  Why is Roland panicking?  He's back.  Oh, okay.  Oh, he's gone.  Oh, no.  Because you were hostile to him last time you got in studio.  Guy.  I say...  I don't have pizza.  You guys...  Yeah, I know, right?  No, that was something on your...  The phones have been fucking up here. 
[02:13:00]  The phones have been screwing up here, guy.  No, so no pizza.  And Roland just panicked because...  I love his ribs.  I love his...  They're delicious.  We like his food, but we got to make it fun for everyone.  Who gives a fuck?  I love his...  I'll be back today.  We like the guy, and we like his food.  We hate the New York Times fucking restaurant reviewer.  What else do you need to hear from us?  Yeah.  Man.  Yeah, Roland's been down a few times.  He was down there actually when we were testing the menu and we were just getting ready  for the big opening, right?  Yeah, I was there drinking. 
[02:13:30]  I was having a kid, I think.  Wasn't that the time?  Yeah.  Yeah, guys.  I had my daughter, and that's why I couldn't make it.  I was bombed.  Well, congratulations on your daughter, and now this is a perfect time to come celebrate.  And you guys just let me know.  I was having someone else's daughter.  See?  Because...  Rough and proud.  Yeah.  It'll happen.  Yeah.  All right, buddy.  By the way, when I stopped by the studio the other day, and you guys weren't there, which  that place had cleared out completely, there was some guy that was getting a whole, just 
[02:14:00]  earful of it for the angry panda sound.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Has that been repaired?  That poor guy was just getting a beat down.  I mean, he was walking out, and I'm like, you know, keep your head up, kid.  Good luck.  He's entitled, and he'll be fine no matter what.  He doesn't really understand how to work hard yet.  No, I'm serious.  When you were coming up, didn't you work hard?  That's all it is. 
[02:14:30]  Thank you.  It wasn't until you work hard.  All you're going to continue to do in life is work hard.  It doesn't...  I tell my kids, it's never going to be easy.  If you want it to be easy, it's...  I don't even know that easy exists anymore.  Work hard and rock hard.  That's right, man.  Work hard and play harder.  Play harder.  That's what I say.  Hells yeah.  I'm a bumper sticker with that.  Hell yeah.  What kind of dessert do you have?  Oh, brother.  I have the best cheesecake.  Cheesecake is my favorite. 
[02:15:00]  Let me guess.  New York cheesecake?  No.  My favorite on it...  We do have New York cheesecake.  Yeah.  My favorite on it is the salted caramel fool.  Ooh.  So we make this salted caramel and these macerated strawberries and a little bit of pound cake,  and it all soaks through.  But getting that rich caramel with the little bit of the...  Did he say pound cake?  Yeah.  Pound cake, yeah.  It was a Van Halen reference.  I'm glad you picked up on that.  Yeah.  Why didn't you send the dessert?  I mean, I like food and all, and your food is very nice. 
[02:15:30]  If you guys would stick around past, you know, 10-0-1, I would have the dessert.  I'd call the restaurant right now and have somebody, you know, wake somebody up and have them get this together.  But next time, we'll do a whole thing about dessert next time.  All right.  Because we can turn this whole thing around and be your worst enemy.  You know that, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know, well, listen.  All right.  So you send that dessert soon.  I was warned.  When you come into New York, you better watch yourself.  And I'm watching.  I thought I was coming to make the right presentation to you guys.  But, I mean, if I see them on the dessert, I better go on the back. 
[02:16:00]  We're worse than the New York Times, trust me.  Oh, yeah.  We got an army behind us.  You don't want to piss us off, sir.  They're terrible people.  So you get that dessert over here pronto.  You guys, I really do, though, on the very serious side of things.  I mean, it's been a crazy run.  But thanks for all the support, man.  You guys are funny dudes.  And it's amazing how, you know, this is fun.  But the support and just the opportunity to talk about it is huge.  That's cool, yeah.  I think in a weird way to wrap this up, I think this could help you, which is really strange. 
[02:16:30]  Because a lot of people have...  Dr. Phil said yesterday.  Dr. Phil said...  Did he really?  And Donnie Deutsch.  Donnie, I mean, great guys.  Both of them were there in the studio.  And they're like, listen, man, you don't understand, dude.  Your food's legit.  You're going to do great with this.  It's going to go places, you know.  Everybody's going to want a bad review.  I'm like, oh, God.  Don't go after it in this direction, please.  No, but in some...  I think in a weird way, this really is going to help you.  Hey, when you saw Donnie Deutsch, did it look like, hey, man. 
[02:17:00]  My clothes were on the floor.  And I just fucking put them on to do a little TV today.  I'm casual.  Donnie's...  I don't know about when you've seen him.  But, man, Donnie had a suit on and he was...  No, but it's the way he has the suit on.  You don't understand.  It's a little wrinkled.  And he doesn't use all the buttons.  Yeah.  And his hair is messy.  Look out.  Look out.  Had a long night of partying.  And I just found my clothes on the floor.  Put them on for TV.  Because I don't care what I look like.  Just happened. 
[02:17:30]  He really cares how he looks.  And we did his show, by the way.  So we liked it.  Yeah, sure.  And he's done our show.  He had a hot chick on his lap the whole time he did our show.  Hot chick.  There's Donnie Doig at the beach.  That doesn't happen to me.  Is that what you're saying?  What happened?  If I don't bring dessert, I don't get that.  I mean, is that why?  I mean, now I'm, like, exiled from that.  Oh, you'd never be exiled.  But, yeah, bring some dessert.  You're on notice.  You're on notice.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll have dessert show Monday. 
[02:18:00]  Like a little dessert.  All right, guy.  Good luck with the restaurant.  It's doing well so far.  We'll be down there.  Roland's going today, I think.  Yeah.  The food you guys sent over, seriously, is terrific.  And ate half the sandwich.  He was talking to you.  I love it.  I appreciate all the support, guys.  I'd love to have you at the restaurant.  We'll do dinner together.  Roland, keep it up.  You know everybody down there.  And we'll get through this.  All right.  Yeah, keep it positive, my friend.  Yeah! 
[02:18:30]  Woo!  Woo-hoo!  Yeah!  Now, we really...  I don't even know what it is you've had.  Nobody's done for the holidays.  Now, we really helped you out today.  So, we want a really nice tweet, because you've got a lot of followers.  That's true.  You make sure you've got Anthony Cumia, C-U-M-I-A, in that tweet.  Oh, thank you.  You make sure you have OP Radio in that tweet, OPIE Radio.  And you say how hilarious we are, and how we're big fans of you, your food, and everything.  I will have it done in capitals. 
[02:19:00]  Nice!  And, and, don't worry, boys, the dessert is on the way.  We want that.  Monday?  I want you to tweak that right now!  Well, Monday, the dessert.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I thought the dessert's going to come Monday.  Oh, okay.  I hope he was jumping the gun there.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Sorry, guys.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Because now I need him.  He has way more followers than us.  See how you spin that shit?  You're beautiful.  Look how you, look how you, yeah, you get your ketchup out of the bottle.  Yeah.  How, how do you do that?  I don't know.  He's rocking it.  We've been looking at pictures of you the entire time. 
[02:19:30]  Fucking rocking it.  Oh, you guys.  Jeez, Shirley.  We could all learn from Guy Fieri.  He has a very, a lot of fun doing what he loves.  It's all about being positive.  There you go.  I like it.  All right, Guy.  All right, guys.  Thanks a bunch, man.  Have good, have good Thanksgiving.  Thanks for the support.  Oh, how many more of these do you have to do today?  Oh, this is it.  I got to get my kids ready to get, uh, kids up, go to school.  My son, Hunter, just got his driving permit yesterday.  So, uh, he thinks he's driving himself to school with me and Ryder in the car.  So, we're going to have that argument this morning. 
[02:20:00]  I don't know that that's exactly going to happen.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  Yeah.  How old is he?  Just, he's 16, man.  He, and he thinks he's going to pop the, you know, the Camaro out of the, out of the garage  and that we're going to go cruise to school in it.  I don't, I don't know.  So, I didn't drive the golf cart for a while, kid.  Wow.  Fuck.  Yeah, it makes you feel old, man.  That's really good.  Yeah.  All this and the driving permit.  So, well, thanks, guys.  You're the best.  I'll tweet it out, and we'll see you.  He's going to tweet it. 
[02:20:30]  All right.  All right, guy.  Very cool, guy.  Thank you, sir.  Thanks, man.  We're Team Guy Fieri.  You know that.  Oh, hell yeah.  Talk to you soon, buddy.  I love it.  All right.  Send t-shirts.  Bye.  Bye.  That was cool.  Oh, hell yeah.  Got pizza?  No.  Click.  He can take.  He can take a joke, I assume.  Well, he rocks out, you know?  Well, what do you want to do?  He does rock out.  A dumb who gives a fuck interview, or you have a little fun, or you at least try it.  Have a little fun, right?  No.  Exactly.  Roland was panicking a few times in there. 
[02:21:00]  Yes.  Were you?  Why?  I don't know.  What happened?  You really like Guy, right?  Yeah.  We like him, too.  Delicious food.  Roland likes celebrity chef friends, and you guys were hostile to him last time he was in.  No, we weren't.  Yeah, you were.  You specifically were, Obi.  Yeah.  Yep.  No.  When was that?  Yes.  No.  A hundred percent.  What happened?  No.  That's when I confronted him and got two or three apologies out of him, and then you said  that you didn't like him because he was giving you phony invites. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, well, that's true.  Yeah.  Remember that, Roland?  I hate you.  I hate the phony invites from celebrities.  He's always going, yeah!  Yeah!  His arm is out.  His fucking one hand is up.  He's rocking it.  I love the, hey, next time you're on L.A., you know, give me a call.  We'll, you know, get a drink or something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then...  All right.  What's your number?  Well, you know, just Roland's got it, or it's always some vague thing.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I'll try to figure all that out when I'm in L.A. next time. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Gotcha.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Yeah, when I was there during his opening, he served me booze, food.  Dude, we love him.  Relax.  It's delicious.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  He knows it.  Relax.  He knows the deal.  He's an entertainer.  Look at him.  No one really acts like that.  People know the difference when we really, truly hate somebody and when we're just having  a good time.  Yeah, like Tiger Max.  Oh, yeah.  That guy.  Fuck that, phony.  I do like...  Oh, no, I can't say phony. 
[02:22:30]  Fuck that dipshit.  There you go.  Say that.  Thank you, Pendulet.  Thank you.  I do like that the legend of how bad Sal and it has now traveled past the show and Guy  Fieri is just bringing it up.  Ah, right.  Same.  He knows.  He knows.  Pendulet's book, by the way, is pretty good, man.  Yeah.  You've been reading it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's the definition of countryside?  What?  You rock now? 
[02:23:00]  His answer would be Piers Morgan.  Why?  Think about it.  Think about it.  Hi.  Is this us?  I, uh...  How about your household?  I'm allergic to dogs.  Yes.  She's hypoallergenic.  I'm allergic to dogs, too.  Oh, it's a clean dog, too.  You can smell.  It's not...  It stinks a little.  Your husband...  No, no.  Your husband didn't come home last night?  No, so I didn't have time to, like, leave her and hope that he would come home and walk 
[02:23:30]  her, so I brought her to work, because, I mean, she...  The bitch has to pee and take a dump.  Aw.  Why didn't your husband come home last night?  Because he's a piece of shit.  Where was he?  Say it.  Can you say it for me?  I ain't saying that shit.  Come on.  What?  You piece of shit?  Thank you.  Thank you.  You know what's funny?  What happened?  Who wouldn't be fucking you, though?  That's what I said.  I said, there's plenty of guys that I'm sure would be down to bang me, but you're just...  Right in this room.  Right in...  I can think of a...  Yeah.  Maybe a couple.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, she came to work. 
[02:24:00]  You notice she's all made up today?  Like, she's got her lipstick on.  Yeah, why?  Why you look so good today?  Because her husband didn't come home last night.  Yeah, you never looked this good.  Because I was crying before, and I wanted to try to cover up tears.  He's not worth it, Nicole.  Thank you.  He's not worth it.  What did he say?  Tell her.  He told me he's a loser.  He's a piece of shit.  He's sorry.  I don't deserve...  He doesn't...  Well, why didn't he come home?  Did he give you an answer, at least?  Because he was wasted.  He was out with his friends getting fucked up.  And do you think he fucked someone else?  Yep. 
[02:24:30]  He was having sexual intercourse with another woman.  Are you all right with that?  Don't say that.  You're talking to his child right now.  Now she sees she's trying to get away.  But why wouldn't he come home?  Because he was...  I mean, have you ever gotten so fucked up that, like, you pass out somewhere?  Not really.  Okay, well...  I was always worried about that.  You guys aren't as...  You don't party like we do.  Oh, so you're taking his side.  Oh, I'm not taking his side.  I can party and still not fucking, you know, fall down drunk and have my dick slip into  a woman.  It better not have slipped into a woman.  It definitely did.  You know, and by the way, Nicole was angry on, like, two days ago. 
[02:25:00]  She was angry on Wednesday for his other drunken escapades.  And now he's not coming home and having sex with other girls.  No, no.  But you have your own drunk escapades.  Yeah, but I never would ever cheat on him.  Ever.  No?  So he did cheat on you.  No, I'm not saying that he cheated on me.  I'm just saying that it's inappropriate once you're married to somebody to not come home.  Period.  It's true.  And if you were married and you went out and got fucked up...  Yeah.  ...and then you didn't come home...  Right.  ...would you be sleeping at one of your guy friend's houses?  No, I'd be fucking some chick. 
[02:25:30]  That's what I thought.  Cool.  Okay, thanks.  You guys, you know what?  You just made me feel so bad.  We helped you, right?  Yeah.  Oh, look at the puppy!  I love how she just laughs.  She don't care.  That's very cute.  Oh, don't worry.  Thanks.  If you need a good fucking, I'm sure you can find one.  Don't worry about that.  And there's plenty of dick around here for you to take.  Yeah.  Lots of...  There's miles of cock around here for you.  Absolutely.  Don't worry so much.  I think we helped her out.  Yeah.  I really do.  We're here to help.  We're in the middle of a library.  Yes, we are. 
[02:26:00]  In a lot of households across...  Why does she walk both legs?  Oh, boy.  Why?  She really does.  There's a lot of space between her upper legs.  Yeah.  Between her upper legs.  She doesn't have a lot of thigh rub at all.  There's been a lot in between.  A lot going on there, I bet.  Especially in her younger years.  Boy, that marriage is just a fucking amazing thing, isn't it?  Isn't that marriage great?  I like mine.  Mine's awesome.  I mean, that marriage.  Hers.  I really do like mine.  Hers...  I don't know much.  The sanctity of... 
[02:26:30]  I don't know.  Hers is terrible.  Hers is awful.  It was awful right from the get-go, right?  They've only been married a couple months, and there's already been some crazy stories.  They've been married a week less than me and Jess.  The honeymoon's fucking over.  Have you gotten so drunk that you didn't make it home?  No.  No.  That hasn't happened to me yet.  Unless Guy Fieri pours booze down your throat.  Exactly.  Then I just fuck anything that moves.  I knew it.  Yeah.  Hey, you know what?  Dish.  We're talking about Dish.  What are you doing?  You want...  Yes.  You don't want people fighting over the TV in your house?

[02:27:30]  The number again, 1-800-WATCH-TV.  Dish lets indeed watch TV.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Here's the latest batch of FUs.  Fuck yeah!  I just want to give Jimmy a big, hearty fuck you for it.  It's a kettlebell day!  Got this shit stuck in my head all the way to work and in the gym.  Fuck you. 
[02:28:00]  Fuck you!  I walked out of my house on Wednesday, and a tree fell in my neighbor's house.  You know what I say?  You got a tree down in your house!  He heard me go fuck myself, so I told him to go fuck you.  Fuck you!  I want to give a big fuck you to all the dirty, smelly bitches at my work that refuse to wipe  their ass with toilet paper and use the toilet seat.  Fuck you, dirty bitches.  Fuck you!  Yeah, hi, this is Sal.  Um, I just want to say fuck you to myself, because I'm just too big of a bitch to get my 
[02:28:30]  ass to go to work when it's sprinkling outside.  My mommy told me it wouldn't be very safe, so, you know, unless I got her walking behind  me to wipe my ass, I'm just too afraid to do anything.  Fuck you, me!  Fuck you!  Fuck you, Louis C.K.  You've made it, brother.  I watched you on Saturday night tonight.  You're fucking hilarious.  And, sorry to hear that, Opie and Anthony.  You know what I'm hearing from your guest.  He's gone.  Fuck you!  I want to give a fuck you to little Sammy Roberts.  Last time I checked, this is the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:29:00]  Not the Opie and Anthony and Sam Roberts show.  So, shut your fucking mouth, you fucking douchebag.  Fuck you!  It's my damn style!  Fuck you, Anarchy Radio!  Fuck you!  Fuck you.  I just wanted to listen to Jacktober, and now I have this stupid fucking dinosaur song  in my head all damn day.  Fuck you.  Fuck you!  Fuck me! 
[02:29:30]  All right, fuck you!  Take this out, you fucking hippopotamus!  Fuck you!  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  866-FU-LINE1.  That's 866-FU-LINE1.  Sirius XM.  XM.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  I gotta tell you, that F.U. line bit is really funny.  That's the first time I've heard it in months.  I'm not even joking.  Who doesn't wipe their ass? 
[02:30:00]  That girl that she said that the girls at her office don't wipe their ass?  How does she know, first of all?  I don't know.  I needed more info on that one.  I'm trying to figure out what this is.  What is it?  Text?  No, I'm sorry.  No, the song.  What is it?  Oh.  I don't know.  It's kind of cool. 
[02:30:30]  Celebration Day by this new band, Led Zeppelin.  Oh, fuck.  That's why.  I should know that.  What black guy wrote this?  You watched the Rolling Stones on HBO last night?  No, I didn't.  I saw the first hour.  It's terrific.  I think the band, finally, after 50 years, said, fuck it.  Show them the good stuff.  Yeah?  Yeah, man.  The movie starts, I think it's 1972, Madison Square Garden getting ready for a show.  And they quickly show Mick Jagger doing cocaine off a knife.  Wow.  I don't think he kind of, I don't remember seeing any of that type of shit. 
[02:31:00]  And then one of the band members is just naked in the green room.  Which one?  Getting ready for the show.  All you saw was his hiney, so I'm not sure.  His hiney?  But Keith Richards definitely took a little peek.  Yeah?  Just a little peek.  What a moe.  And the movie starts with the band talking, and they say cameras were not allowed into the interview.  So it's weird, because it's a black screen, and then you hear the band talking.  And I wonder why they did that.  Maybe because they look old as shit, and they just don't want that out there? 
[02:31:30]  I don't know.  But that's how the movie kind of started, them talking about shit, but you can't see their faces.  And then they go with all the old footage.  Really fucking good so far, man.  I got tired, because I got the two kids, so I fucking crashed a tent.  I got an hour to go on that damn thing.  Oh.  You like the Stones, right?  Yeah, I do.  I do.  You realize how many fucking great songs they've had.  Just hit after hit.  And the ones that aren't even a hit.  Yeah.  You go, oh, yeah, that song. 
[02:32:00]  That one's cool, too.  I do like the older stuff, though.  Oh, of course.  70s.  Yeah, yeah.  That shit's pretty good.  I mean, I tapped out after Tattoo You, and even Tattoo You, you know, compared to the older stuff.  It doesn't hold up.  I know it was successful and all that.  I know that.  But I like Waiting on a Friend, which we've made fun of on the show.  And you know what?  Even though it's been played a million times, Start Me Up is just a toe tapper.  Yeah.  But, I mean, the stuff before that was way better.  And then I don't really acknowledge the shit after that. 
[02:32:30]  Undercover the Night was kind of cool in a weird way, but it's not like...  That sounds like a completely different band, though.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, if someone came from another planet, they would go, yeah, that's not the Stones.  What band is that?  After, like, a bunch of other stuff, like, holy shit, there's another planet, and there's people on it.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Learn about their science.  Right, okay.  Let me learn what they know.  Their weaponry, perhaps.  And then...  And then...  Like, years, years, millennia later, they could be like...  After they get over...  You know that's the Rolling Stones, like, in the 60s and 70s, were a lot different. 
[02:33:00]  After they get over the fact that, wow, they look way different than I do.  Right, what type of life form is this?  They only have one nose, and they don't get over six feet tall in general?  And then way, way down the line.  I'm 18 feet tall.  This is weird.  Way down the line.  Anyway.  They might start discussing the Rolling Stones.  Wow, they actually eat stuff.  That's weird.  On our planet, that went away fucking thousands of years ago. 
[02:33:30]  Right, let's look into this for, like, 10,000 years.  They still give a fuck about their hair and their appearance.  Damn.  We all have this gray appearance on our planet.  Oh.  Yeah, after all that, you're right.  After all that.  Yeah.  Then I would say, look, listen to these two things and tell me if they're the same banner.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, Dick Cavett.  Look at that fucking young Dick Cavett.  Is this the start of the whole movie?  This is the whole movie.  Oh, fuck, let's just play it.  Do you want to watch it?  Yeah, the second hour I missed, so start there.  Oh, okay. 
[02:34:00]  My way around here, I don't know.  About halfway, then?  Look at this.  Crowded.  Do you know what's upset to all these people?  Hey, look at this.  Yeah.  Oh, man, that's young man.  Crowded.  I didn't sleep after opening night last night.  Andy Warhol, that weirdo was in the dressing room.  Yeah.  Played something going around.  Hey, it's the little kid from fucking Walking Dead in the background.  Salt vitamins and salt pills.  Yeah.  They tell me where they usually I see in salt.  Yeah.  Dick Cavett noticed salt in the locker room.  This looks like fucking Spinal Tap. 
[02:34:30]  Dude.  The way they're talking and what they're talking about, it's just this inane backstage conversation  like Spinal Tap.  You know, a lot of people have, you know, hold on a second.  Mick Jagger, the reference of Mick Jagger, is an older guy, right?  Yeah.  But when you see Mick Jagger move on a stage in the 70s, you realize completely that every  front man ripped off Mick Jagger.  Mick Jagger.  Period.  Black Crows, especially.  Well, Chris Robinson is identical to Mick Jagger and how Mick Jagger moved on a stage. 
[02:35:00]  Absolutely.  But you see a million different front men doing the Mick Jagger moves and you realize it when  you see Mick on stage in the 70s when he could really fucking move.  Hit it again, please.  Mythos, man.  Where's this?  The second hour?  Yeah.  I was kidding.  I don't know.  The first few minutes of the movie is good.  I want to show Ant.  Boom.  We're right back there then.  Boom.  That's the concert in Hyde Park after Brian Jones died.  Ain't no thing. 
[02:35:30]  Doesn't that less upset you?  All these people?  Yeah.  It's a great crowd.  It's a morning show.  Yeah.  How did you sleep after opening night last night?  Not very well.  Say, I don't know if I was supposed to see this or not, but there was a plate of something  going around people offering me little pills.  Vitamins and salt.  Vitamins and salt.  Vitamins.  You're right.  Vitamins and salt.  Vitamins and salt.  Yeah.  Vitamins and salt with plenty of water.  I want big bread.  Do you want to do it all now, Dick?  Excuse me.  We could.  Yeah, we can cut it.  I've been working with this. 
[02:36:00]  How much is your technique and your sense of timing?  And that goes on.  This is so Spinal Tap.  Yes.  It's great.  The face-to-face interviews.  I'm telling you, I think you would love it.  And the band, just like Spinal Tap, they don't even give any answers to anything.  Listen to the sustain on this guitar.  Listen to the sustain.  All these reporters and interviewers hoping for that big moment, and they're just like...  You play a note.  You go out, have a bite.  You come back.  You still be hearing that one.  A Brett Morgan film.  Who's Brett Morgan?  Do we know Brett Morgan?  I don't know. 
[02:36:30]  Whoa.  It's all made up.  It's 40 years ago.  The movie starts from 1972.  But if you keep folding it, it gets smaller.  I want big bread.  Oh, it was Mick Jagger getting naked.  Oh, God.  Mick's asshole.  Just right into the camera.  Oh, God.  His gaping hair crack.  You see Keith take a little peek? 
[02:37:00]  Of course.  Pink.  Crossfire Hurricane.  Whoa.  His cock.  Getting into his fucking stage pants.  Nice bulge, huh?  Nice.  His cave.  Young cave.  Look how skinny Mick is.  Holy shit.  That's hilarious.  Look at his ass in his jumpsuit, making sure it's okay.  What the fuck is he doing?  I don't know, man.  That's great.  There it is.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:37:30]  Doing a little coke off a knife.  No, maybe it's vitamins or salt.  Maybe it was vitamins or salt.  Salt.  All right.  Well, it's obviously a visual.  But I highly recommend everyone see the Rolling Stones movie on HBO.  Crossfire Hurricane.  We had to make up for their set.  We came out.  They were still booing them when we came on.  Still booing them when we came on.  That's such a great fucking line.  Now you got me wanting to see Spinal Tap again. 
[02:38:00]  Ah, it's hilarious.  You know, it would be great to see this and then go right to Spinal Tap.  Right.  And see exactly what they got.  That would be a great double feature.  Yeah, yeah.  Great double feature.  It just shows you how brilliant Spinal Tap was because, I mean, without even trying,  they parodied these films so perfectly.  And they got some down and dirty shit, man.  Yeah.  The Stones doing some blues standards.  Yeah.  Fuck, Mick.  Standards.  Yeah.  Fuck, Mick knows how to sing the blues, especially back then.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck, yeah.  It was right through you.  It was nice. 
[02:38:30]  Damn.  I bet you Ron Bennington was all about this movie last night.  Ah, I bet so.  Well, Ronnie fucked me over.  What happened?  Well, I was driving home.  Yeah.  And he was interviewing, was it Tim from Tim and Eric?  Yeah.  Yeah, Tim.  Who's Tim and Eric?  You know Tim and Eric?  They put out Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie.  Adult Swim.  Adult Swim.  They're very, you know, underground-y kind of, again, alternative freakish guys.  Right.  They make these very strange movies that, I don't know, hipsters really enjoy, I guess. 
[02:39:00]  Name one I know.  I don't know.  Tim and Eric.  Tim and Eric.  Yeah, I don't know it.  It's pretty much just Tim and Eric.  Okay.  And that's where, like, what's his name?  Steve Brühl.  Steve Brühl.  Dr. Steve Brühl came from.  Okay.  It was Tim and Eric.  So, he had Tim on, and he was talking about a movie that he's in.  He didn't write it or anything, but he's in it, called The Comedy.  And I'm listening, going, this sounds pretty cool. 
[02:39:30]  You know?  This sounds like something I might want to watch.  So, I go home, and they said it was on demand, and it's opening limited release in the theaters  soon, but it's on demand.  So, right when I got home, I turned it on.  I'm going, I want to check this out, because it sounded very cool.  Ronnie said he watched it twice, and he didn't know what to make of it.  Wow.  And I like, I like those kind of movies.  Sure.  It was terrible.  It was fucking terrible.  Not even in a way where I didn't know what to make of it or anything. 
[02:40:00]  I wanted it to be as good as Ronnie sold it, is what it was.  I wanted it to be as good as Ronnie sold it.  But he wasn't selling, and I don't want to make it sound like Ronnie was selling something.  Right.  Because he said he didn't get the movie.  He didn't really know what to make of it.  What makes it so terrible?  Because the idea sounded very cool.  What's the idea?  It's like a guy in his 30s who's still acting like he's in his fucking teens or 20s.  He's a fuck-up. 
[02:40:30]  But it's not done in a cutesy way like Adam Sandler would.  Like, the way Adam Sandler acts in movies and people are like, aw.  Right.  You know, all that goofy Adam Sandler, because it's a comedy.  Sure.  This, he's acting like that, and you get people's reactions like, what an asshole this guy is.  Why would you be like that?  Right.  Right.  So, it sounded kind of, you know, fascinating.  No, it wasn't.  Oh.  It was dull.  It was a little.  Gay, obviously.  Too strange.  Yeah.  Well, Tim and Eric always do a bunch of gay stuff, so I guess they. 
[02:41:00]  I've seen a clip.  But they're not gay.  They're just guys bro-ing out.  You know, they're bro-ing.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  That's different.  Yeah.  If you're completely naked with your pal and you say, we're just bro-ing out, it's not gay.  Yeah.  Got it.  I tried.  Yeah, but Ronnie's the king of the carnies.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's the king of the carnies.  He likes that position.  I fell for his throw the balls at the fucking bowling pins and knock them down for a dollar.  He's a nice guy, but he's also the king of the carnies, which I don't know how that's possible 
[02:41:30]  to be the king of the carnies and a nice guy, but Ron Bennington, he pulls it off.  He made it sound like something I absolutely would have enjoyed watching, but then I didn't  really enjoy watching it.  Maybe you just don't get it, man.  Maybe I don't.  Maybe you got to see it a few times, man.  Maybe I do.  I hate when people tell me that.  No, it's one of those things you got to see a few times and then it really starts to sink  in.  I don't have time to see things a few times. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, enough.  Yeah, exactly.  What do you think of this, Sam?  You're watching the trailer, right?  Yeah.  What are you getting from it?  I'm not a Tim and Eric guy to start with.  No one is, obviously.  Yeah, I mean-  A small niche of people are.  There's nothing compelling about this to me.  No.  Is that the mystery guest for E-Rock's show tomorrow?  Oh, God.  Is it Tim?  Tim or Eric?  Ronnie B fucking got me.  But that's what Ron does.  He's a great interviewer in the sense that he'll talk about the project, but not just like,  so tell me about the project. 
[02:42:30]  Right.  Like, he'll actually look at the project and-  He watched it twice.  That's what sold me.  It's like, if Ronnie B watched something twice, Ronnie is a smart motherfucker.  If he watched something once and was like, I gotta watch that again, I'm thinking, fuck,  man.  This has gotta be some pretty deep, compelling shit.  You know why I watched it twice?  Because Ron's sitting there going, my job is to make this guy sound compelling while  talking about this.  I gotta watch this thing again.  Because I got nothing from it the first time.  Sitting there chatting notes.  He's like, no, this is not coming. 
[02:43:00]  Maybe.  And that's where the niceness comes in.  Yeah, maybe you're right.  He realizes it was a bad booking, but he's like, oh, fuck, I could carny up this shit  for him.  Right.  Well, he absolutely played me like the mark on the fucking, the midway.  Bent basketball rim?  Bent basketball rim.  Or Balloon's not fully blown up.  Balloon's not blown up with twisted flights on the darts.  Uh-huh.  The fucking, the lever, the fulcrum on the hammer and the fucking ring the bell thing  is way, way too close to the fucking part that hits the hammer. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, is that how that works?  Oh, yeah.  Wait, so how do you beat that game?  Actually, the fulcrum would be closer to the part that is near the thing that gets launched.  But if you know that, can you win the game?  Well, they have the place you hit it.  You're supposed to hit it as close to the fulcrum as possible.  That way you get more leverage on it.  Okay.  Well, less leverage, actually, because you don't want the leverage.  The longer the surfaces that you're hitting away from the fulcrum. 
[02:44:00]  I'm listening.  Sorry.  We got breaking news.  I'll finish it.  It will get less power to the end that actually.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you can beat that if you know all that shit.  You can.  You can.  But again, I was the mark.  Oh, my God.  How Sam is holding his head.  Oh, no.  We got a perfect.  Don't say what it is.  Don't say it.  Sam, what's going on?  You got to be.  You had to listen to the show earlier.  Iraq was vague again to me on text messages.  He's doing a show tomorrow from six to seven. 
[02:44:30]  You know what?  Let me read the text messages again.  Please do.  Because, I mean, we do have a whole new audience constantly.  Yeah.  So, Eric, I'll just read the part that matters to the discussion right now.  Okay.  So, okay.  He writes, but.  Yeah.  And I didn't bite on the butt.  Then he writes, Saturday, six to seven, which is tomorrow.  If you'd like to stop by, my secret guest is a big fan of yours.  Oh, a secret guest, big fan of Opie's, wants Opie to stop by. 
[02:45:00]  I write, he writes, you would find it interesting.  Oh, would you?  Look at Sam's face as I reread these texts.  Sam has both hands over his mouth, and he's shaking his head like, oh, my God, no.  Okay.  I write, who?  Yeah, you want to know.  And he writes, not saying till I start the show.  Oh.  And then he writes, you know of this person, but I've never met.  Oh.  So, he's trying to convince me to come in for this show of his tomorrow.  He's unaware that I got two kids under the age of two and a half, that I don't, I just 
[02:45:30]  don't have willy-nilly time.  You're a busy guy.  I would love to have willy-nilly time.  Should Anthony see it before you do?  No, no.  I shouldn't see it.  I don't want to hear it yet.  What I do want to hear is, how did you get this very sensitive EROC secret information?  Talent department, yo.  Talent department, yo.  Okay, because we just.  Because the talent department has access to everything.  Especially after his vagueness.  We made it our mission today to find out who the mystery guest is and blow up his spot.  And we have the mystery guest's name now.  And you showed it to Sam, and Sam's reaction was perfect. 
[02:46:00]  It was the reaction I completely expected, by the way.  Like, I can't believe.  Once again, him building up something that is absolutely no big deal.  I do want to do this, but you made me do it.  I can't believe what the degree to which this letdown is.  Now, the person who it is, is not a bad guy.  I like them.  But.  Is it a celebrity?  No.  Oh, my God. 
[02:46:30]  Like, it's not.  I guess it's a public figure, but it's not a celebrity.  It's not a celebrity more than I'm a celebrity.  It's not a celebrity.  Holy shit.  Not even close, then, to being a celebrity.  I'll tell you.  Sam is more of a celebrity.  Wow.  And he's teasing this to make me go, you know what, I've got to go in and see who he's  talking about.  This is his big get for bageling with the sex.  I'll say this.  You're going to Philly.  Of course.  This guest, like, if he were coming, I wouldn't even mention it on a promo. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, my God.  I would mention, like, as I was saying.  Why does he do this?  As I was saying, here's what's coming up on the show.  Right.  Like, maybe on an after show, I would be like, oh, and I also have this person coming in,  so that should be fun, because he's a good guy, and we'll do some fun stuff together.  Yeah.  But not like, I have a little, like, this is not an up-my-sleeve guest.  And he's keeping it secret on purpose.  Some guesses coming in.  Is it Mr. Manfredi?  That would be a bigger guess.  That's a bigger guess.  I'm telling you.  That girl knows how to walk. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, man.  Who is she?  She knows how to walk.  I can't give you too many details.  Here, I'll just write down.  It starts with an I and ends with a turn.  We have to start talking about every single person.  It starts with an I and ends with a turn.  What?  Oh, okay.  We've decided to talk about every single person that walks by this.  Every single one.  Now, it's a complete distraction.  That girl knew how to walk.  Her hips were going like this.  Were they?  I missed that one.  And she didn't have this.  No, good.  That secretary thing.  She had this.  Yeah.  What? 
[02:48:00]  So this guest, like, he won't be bad for, like, content-wise.  Oh.  But the majority of our audience doesn't even know who he is.  Holy shit.  That's right, right?  So why would he just tell me?  Like, the vast majority of our audience has no clue who he is.  I'm just going to hand to you.  Vast?  I would say I only know who he is because Eric tweets him.  Oh.  Let it.  You want to see it first?  No.  I want to hear on the air.  As the listeners know, I want to know.  This is the big mystery guest for his show tomorrow from 6 to 7 on this channel.  You're not going to believe it.  That he was teasing through text messages yesterday. 
[02:48:30]  And on the air.  Teasing on the air.  Teasing during text.  Won't let Elpy know who it is.  Jesus Christ.  You go.  It's befuddling is what it is.  And I like the guy.  Who cares, though?  He's a great guy.  I thought we met.  Do you even know who he is?  Who the fuck is that?  You know who he is.  He's a good guy.  We like him.  We support him.  But who cares?  Who the?  I don't know who is that.  Who the fuck are you?  Chad Dukes. 
[02:49:00]  Who the fuck are you?  It's Chad Dukes.  He does radio in D.C.  And nothing against Chad Dukes.  But how, like.  That's what I'm saying.  He's a great guy.  He's presenting it.  That could have been a, hey, Chad Dukes is in town.  You want to meet for a beer?  I'd rather hear Al Dukes.  And I probably would go, yeah, I'll meet for a beer if I had the, you know, if I could make the time.  Right.  But it's not a whole thing like, oh, make sure you don't have any plans.  Come in here.  What is he doing?  Anthony's face is so upset.  I have no idea who it is.  I'm not kidding.  I do not know who Chad Dukes is. 
[02:49:30]  Al Dukes would be a bigger guest.  Al Dukes.  Because he's associated with the show somehow.  Wait, I get Chad Dukes confused with the guy from Tampa that knows Bobo.  No, that's not Cowhead.  That's Cowhead.  Yeah, I know.  They're the same guy to me.  I know they're different guys, but they're the same guy.  Who is he?  Show me a picture.  He's just a supportive radio guy.  You won't know him by a picture.  What the fuck is Iraq talking about?  I don't know this guy.  He's a fan of the show who also does radio.  He's a good guy.  Why keep it secret? 
[02:50:00]  Thank you.  Like I said, if he told me, hey, I did my hour with Chad Dukes.  He's in town.  You want to meet him and have a beer?  I probably would say, yeah, that's cool.  He rocks an idiot.  Of course he is.  He rocks an idiot.  Like this is the exact type of guy that you say, he books no one cares about.  How do you think of that?  You go on and you say, oh, I got good news.  It looks like Chad Dukes, he does radio in DC, is going to come up and do the show with  me.  It'll be fun. 
[02:50:30]  Not like, wait till you see.  He's a big fan.  You know him, but you haven't met him.  Who's on after him?  Come on up.  Who's on after E-Rock tomorrow?  Dave.  East Side Dave.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Dave's a sports show.  Which is rarely about sports.  Almost never.  Which is good.  That's how a sports show should be.  Exactly.  Get some of the shit out of the way and then have some fun.  And then fuck around.  Yeah, fuck you.  When I was listening to Mike and the Mad Dog, that's when I really liked listening to  them.  When they got off sports and started doing their other shit. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  Movies or whatever the big news story was.  See, people saying the Duke University rapists would have been better guests.  Right.  Now, I like Chad Duke, so don't be confused by this, but how he's promoting his corpse.  And he's making Chad Dukes look bad because people are going to call up and be like, who  the fuck is Chad Dukes?  Duke Ellington's rotted cock.  As opposed to being like, oh, this guy is good.  You know what's great about this?  E-Rock is going to be so livid now because he will just not see it our way.  No.  And that's why this is so beautiful every time. 
[02:51:30]  That's your first show's first guest?  He's been doing radio for 90 years.  No, no, no, which is fine.  Hold on, which is fine.  Why?  No, it's not.  No, it's fine to have that as a guy to do radio with or bring in, but you don't tease  it like it's a big, huge fucking rock star.  As a co-host, perhaps.  Right.  As a first guest on your first show.  No, sorry.  He's a guy to hang with.  I don't know him.  Right, right.  Second Mike.  Right.  Kind of a thing.  Not, here's a guest.  Let me keep it secret.  Hush, hush from the audience. 
[02:52:00]  Why?  Remember.  You could have said his name.  No one would have known.  Remember, I'm going to read it again.  Yeah.  Now that we all know, he writes, hey, Saturday, six to seven, if you'd like to stop by, my  secret guest is a big fan of yours.  You would find it interesting.  Maybe Bo and Luke, Duke.  Who is it?  Not saying until I start the show.  You know of this person, but I've never met.  I would be pissed off. 
[02:52:30]  You should be pissed off.  If I went to my wife and my two kids, hey, you know, man, this E-Rock thing sounds really  important.  You know, I'm going to go check it out.  I'd be mad when I got here.  If that sounds to me like that text message, if I were you, it would be, oh, there's a  celebrity in here who knows who I am.  That's going to be cool.  Yeah.  And then it's like, yeah, I know Chad Deuce.  No, we just haven't.  And don't get confused, Chad.  I like it.  It has nothing to do with that.  It's just how he presents shit all the time with us.  Yes.  100%.  Sam asked me who's on my show.  I'd tell him. 
[02:53:00]  Oh.  By the way, we have Guy Fieri gift cards.  Yeah.  Oh.  How many we got?  Five.  Woo.  $25.  Rock and roll.  Nice.  Hey, do we know, can we make certain that these are given away to New Yorkers?  Because I don't want them to go to waste.  Yeah, because we're going to need to get addresses to ship.  So you, please, don't fuck around.  We want to give them away to people that absolutely could go to the restaurant in Times Square that  the New York Times is killing.  We have a Call of Duty, too, if you want to do that.  Chad.  Huh, dudes?  You have a Call of Duty, too. 
[02:53:30]  No, I need one.  I need another one.  I got two nephews that play.  Oh.  And I got one so far.  I need another one.  We have another one.  Oh, wink, wink, nudge, nudge.  Hey, plugola.  That's what I'm talking about, brother.  Dr. Steve is reminding.  The old make-believe he gave the prize away.  I'm in.  Rock and roll.  Rock and roll.  Seventh call against that.  Sorry, Ed.  That's okay.  Dr. Steve is reminding people.  E-Rock was Dr. Steve's.  He's saying, E-Rock was my first guest on my show, and I bumped him to take phone calls. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, by the way, Dr. Steve, I didn't have time to call you back.  Thank you.  Oh.  He was pissed off by my story yesterday.  Bringing the kid to the playoffs.  Oh, well, I'm sure he is.  And how the tech treated me.  Yeah.  Thank you, sir.  I honestly can't believe that that's a guest.  I love, Chad Dukes is a great guy.  We talk about wrestling.  He's awesome.  No, you completely believe.  Like, you were thinking this was going to turn out differently than the past shit?  I had no idea. 
[02:54:30]  It always turns out this way, where he oversells something.  Exactly.  I didn't think it would be the bust to this degree that it is.  Total.  The machine is calling into my show.  Burke Reischer.  I thought it would be at least somebody more famous than me.  Burke Reischer?  More famous than me.  There's so many people more famous than me.  Oh, my God.  Like, everybody.  Yeah, I know.  Was it my job to go, oh, come on, Sam.  Not really.  No, no.  Yeah, no.  Half the listeners are more famous than me.  Yeah, Coke Logic is a bigger guest than Chad Dukes.  Yes.  Than you.  Than me. 
[02:55:00]  Say it.  Because he's got talent, Coke Logic.  He does animation.  I don't know anything.  We do have another Call of Duty, though, once, if you want to give it that away.  Oh.  Another one, Wink Wink, or another one?  No, we have another one.  Another one, or another one, Wink Wink?  No, Wink Wink.  Ronnie tells great stories about that.  I can't do it justice about the old days of, like, you know, you give away.  I'm paraphrasing now because I don't remember the exact story, but it was like,  Hey, see you, too, in Ireland. 
[02:55:30]  And then, you know, fast forward, the contest is over, and it's like the friend of the program  director happened to win the fucking contest.  That inside radio shit, I still want to do a super roundtable with old radio guys because  there was some shit that went down before they started controlling this environment.  A lot of improprieties.  You never had a chance at those huge prizes, for the most part.  Most radio stations, those were given away to special people.  Why give them away to fucking people you don't know?  When you can take care of somebody. 
[02:56:00]  Exactly.  When you can take care of your drug dealer.  Yeah.  Gary in Brooklyn.  I'll take a gift card.  Fuck, and I can tell you're from Brooklyn by your voice, sir.  You got a $25 gift card for Guy Fieri's new restaurant in Times Square.  Very cool, man.  And what's the name of the place again?  Guy's American Grill.  Yeah.  We support Guy Fieri, even though the New York Times gave him a shitty review.  I mean, we're eating the food today.  We like it.  I'm bringing some of it home.  Gary, hold on a line. 
[02:56:30]  All right, buddy?  Thanks, man.  All right.  Gary in Brooklyn, thank you.  Let's see if this guy is actually from Long Island.  Doug.  Yeah, what's going on, guys?  I'm not convinced yet.  Say one Long Island word.  Storm.  Horrible.  Storm.  Horrible.  No, like, how do we pronounce shit?  Give me one word.  Long Islanders would go, yeah, he's from Long Island.  F.H. Reilly. 
[02:57:00]  Name two.  I like F.H. Reilly.  How old are you, sir?  I'm 41.  All right.  Name two Long Island strip clubs.  Uh, you got a carousel that dump.  Yeah.  And, um...  Past or present?  Yeah.  And the one, uh, what's this place called, uh, down in Hempstead?  Down where?  You're brave.  Hempstead.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  You like black girls.  Jesus.  You like black strippers. 
[02:57:30]  I stick to the white clubs.  No, carousel's good.  All right, look, you're saying carousel, that dump, that proved it right there.  Okay.  That's good.  He's legit.  All right, you're legit, too.  Oh, uh, Sam, we just went fucking, uh, too local with strip clubs.  Yeah, that's true.  A certain programmer, uh, programmer around here would not be happy with us.  Not at all.  Because someone in Iowa doesn't understand strip clubs.  It's supposed to be the nation's morning show.  Um, all right, Doug, hold on a line.  Is someone getting these guys' names?  Hope so.  Sal's supposed to be.  Where is he?  He's in there.  Should be in there. 
[02:58:00]  So why didn't he pick up Gary yet?  Gary has to wait for his $25 gift card?  We're getting that.  It's not a trip to Florida.  Let's go.  He's probably hungry.  Dude, uh, I'm getting a report.  Chad Dukes, uh, has tweeted.  Um, Anthony screaming, who the fuck are you equals gut punch.  You have to know it.  I swear, it's nothing personal.  I'm not pulling a radio gag.  I'm not trying to, I don't know who Chad Dukes is.  You put on blinders.  I've never heard of that name. 
[02:58:30]  The only Dukes I know is Al Dukes.  I don't know Chad Dukes.  Now let me give him a gut punch.  Who's he?  Who's he?  Yeah, exactly.  Oh God, did he want my love?  Oh man.  And this is another Chad Dukes tweet.  Quote, I do not know who Chad Dukes is.  Al Dukes would be a bigger guest.  Hashtag day ruined.  Hey, Sal, he's funny.  Maybe his surprise guest is going to cancel.  Hold on a minute.  Hold on a minute.  Uh, Gary in Brooklyn.  Yeah.  You won a $25 gift card 25 minutes ago. 
[02:59:00]  Has anyone, uh, talked to you yet?  Uh, no, it's been kind of quiet.  Oh my God.  What, what's taking Sal so long?  Sal, comment.  We're answering all the other phone calls.  No, I don't need any more.  I don't need, I got five.  Okay.  Travis, don't defend Sal.  It's fun to beat him up.  Thank you.  Now there's one Dukes that I would come up to meet and shake his hand.  Oh, Travis just got mad.  David Dukes.  Ooh.  David Dukes, you'd prefer Chad Dukes.  David Dukes.  All right.  Well, Dukes, Dukes, whatever.  Yeah.  I would definitely get his autograph.  You want to go to Jersey? 
[02:59:30]  At least that's confirmed that he is the guest.  Let's go to Eric in Jersey.  Do you have a Jersey shit, Eric?  What do you want to know?  Your Jersey?  Your Jersey.  Give us Jersey shit.  Give us one bit of Jersey trivia.  Uh, AJ's strip club and sea caucus.  AJ's strip club and sea caucus.  It sounds like it's real.  That is pretty good.  You got $25 gift card.  What's the stinkiest exit on the parkway?  Uh, Parkway 163.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  163.  You got a gift card as well there, sir. 
[03:00:00]  Hold on.  That's three, right?  Why don't we grab one from Pennsylvania?  I'm just trying to show the world that we have people listening in all states.  I thought you were showing the world you love rock and roll.  I do love rock and roll.  My God.  Woo!  Oh, that was, that's, I had to say that at every hour.  I know.  Show the world you love rock and roll with WBAB.  No, it was, uh.  Show the world you love rock and roll with WBAB.  Remember that one?  That was before my time, but every hour I had to name a town. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, we want to thank Bayshore for showing the world they love rock and roll.  And then you would go into one of those.  Bad company.  Heavy testing fucking records that everyone liked.  Bad company, bad company, off bad company.  That would make, no, it would have to be a little more uptempo, I think, in general.  A little Jumpy Jack Flash or something like that.  Oh, okay.  Very safe.  All right.  Uh, Pennsylvania checking in.  Matt, give me some Pennsylvania shit.  Uh, Pennsylvania shit.  I have no idea.  Why don't you say, hey, we fucked up the election. 
[03:01:00]  That would be a, that would be a Pennsylvania fact.  I didn't fuck you.  Hey, we cheated.  That, Romney got zero votes in Philadelphia.  And that's not cheating?  I mean, I mean.  Yeah.  You don't know anything about Pennsylvania?  Yeah, no lots.  What do you want to know?  Give me something that makes me, uh, think you're from PA.  Well, try not to give these cards away to people that aren't close, is what I'm saying.  Let's hear your coal miner cough.  Black lung.  All right, Matt.  Hold on.  I'm not going to fucking. 
[03:01:30]  Give you a thought of a lager.  All right, hold on.  You win.  I'm not going to.  Lagers.  I'm not going to fucking.  I hate the lagers.  I don't feel like working that hard for a $25 gift card.  Really?  Is this Fred from Brooklyn?  It is.  All right.  I'm going to.  Oh, that is the Fred from Brooklyn.  I'm going to take care of one of our own.  This is how Plugola works right here.  Yeah.  Oh, look at that.  Out of nowhere, Fred from Brooklyn called in randomly, and he gets a $25 gift card to  Guy's restaurant.  Hey, Fred.  Hey, Fred.  Hey, Fred.  Congrats.  Oh, sure, Fred.  How's the.  I would never pay to go there, so I appreciate it. 
[03:02:00]  Oh, man.  See, he's from Brooklyn.  You work for the Times.  How's the podcast?  Pretty good.  Pretty good.  Thank you very much.  All right.  I see you tweeting about your podcast.  Shoot.  I'm going to listen to one of these days.  All right, Fred.  Hold on the line, buddy.  Thank you, sir.  I think that's five, Roland.  I have one PS3 if you want to give away.  A PS3.  A whole PS3?  Call of Duty game.  Hard in addition.  He just announced that.  But a minute ago, you just said, I have a PS3 to give away.  That's not a PS3.  It's not a PS3 game.  That's different.  Call of Duty 4 PS3. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  That's like, I have a Corvette to give away.  Oh, wait.  No, it's the rear view mirror.  Dryer.  Door.  Dryer.  Door.  Yeah.  Hair roll.  Those are the gift cards.  We'll do the other thing while we wrap up for the week.  Yeah.  A little call.  Speaking of video games, though, Danny pulled something pretty cool.  His pud?  His pud.  And a report on video games from, I love this shit, from 1991.  Wow.  That's like going back in time.  That's why the news is complete nonsense.  They've been saying the same shit to us for decades. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  This hurts.  This is in trouble.  Blah.  It's all the same shit.  Let's see how relevant this is, then.  I'm sure it's going to be how kids are playing too many video games.  And it's affected in some way.  In 91?  I don't know.  Let's see, I guess.  Our video game industry is hotter than ever this season.  Nope.  See, it's still hotter than ever.  Hotter than ever.  It's hotter than ever right now.  Hotter than ever.  It continues to be hotter than ever.  Yeah.  Especially with Black Ops coming out.  That's great.  Our video game industry is hotter than ever this season.  And one good reason?  Nintendo has introduced some hot new toys. 
[03:03:30]  But have things gone a bit too far?  Oh.  This evening, Ken Shockley wraps up a...  Things gone a bit too far with a Nintendo game?  In 91, a Nintendo game?  Jesus.  Hey, hey, here's the future.  Yeah.  You're listening to the future right now.  It gets way worse.  Now when you kill people in video games, it kind of looks real.  Brink, brink.  Right.  Bink, bink, bink, bink, bink, bink, bink, bink, bink, bink, bink, bink, bink, bink, bink, bink.  Special report on video mania. 
[03:04:00]  Does this really have to cost this much?  Where should the anger be directed?  Not at the parents, but at the, what, the manufacturer?  So it has come to this.  Oh, boy.  Therapy sessions for families whom you could call...  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Video game addicts.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Whoa.  Ninten pendant.  First of all, the peer pressure starts.  I feel maybe exploited.  Psychologists' offices might get more crowded this holiday season.  Just in time for Christmas, the Japanese toy maker, Nintendo, has come out with a new set of electronic video games. 
[03:04:30]  Wow.  Listen, that sound.  At $200, a Super Nintendo setup costs twice as much as the old system, and you can't mix and match.  What?  For the money, the company promises better pictures, sound, and adventures.  Some of the...  And adventures.  Adventures.  I like my video games to contain adventures.  God, they lied.  Sound.  That mini-fucking-horrid sound. 
[03:05:00]  It's terrible.  Sound and adventures.  Some of the new games look like updated takes on fairly well-known formats.  In the racing game of F-Zero, you're in a futuristic race car.  No, you're not.  I'm sure that sucks.  You're not in a futuristic race car?  Punch up a screen cap from...  What's the name of that game?  I couldn't really tell.  F-Zero.  F-Zero.  F-Zero.  It was a great game for Super Nintendo.  Fair enough, but did you feel like you were in a futuristic fucking...  Get me a screen cap.  You know, you kind of did. 
[03:05:30]  Do you feel like you're in a futuristic car?  That's like fucking five colors.  That's nice.  A futuristic car.  Holy shit.  You know what, though?  At the time, I bet that fucking rocked.  But you didn't feel like you were in a futuristic car.  No, you felt like you were at the arcade.  Exactly.  Wow, is that fucking non-immersive, two-dimensional shite.  No, it's sad.  You want to hear something?  What?  This report's from 1991. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  We started doing radio together a mere three years later.  Three years after this.  You must have been young.  Three years later.  That's true.  In a racing game of F-Zero, you're in a futuristic race car.  Oh, I guess I should watch where I'm driving instead of talking.  The 3D effect, as you can see, is pretty good.  They have a 3D effect?  Well, he means just the perspective view.  Yeah, I get it.  It makes it... 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, the 3D effect.  That's not a 3D effect, really, is it?  Not at all.  All right.  Instead of talking.  The 3D effect, as you can see, is pretty good by video game standards.  This is a nice, clear stretch, even if I am in reverse.  Let's see if we can't turn the car around right about now.  If you're a real good player, meaning you've got the skill of a 9- or 10-year-old,  you can even try to jump your car.  It was now 30.  But look out.  If you miss, the game lets you know your status.  Some parents are refusing to be taken in. 
[03:07:00]  I'm going to say no, and I'm going to explain to him how people market things to make you spend more money.  Nintendo controls 80% of the video market.  Because some game players prefer the pictures of its competitor, Sega.  But no matter how you play the game...  I was a Sega guy.  ...or which game you play, things definitely have come a long way since Pac-Man.  Have they?  Channel 4 News.  Not really.  Have they?  I would play Pac-Man over F-Zero.  I was a Sega guy. 
[03:07:30]  I had the Sega Genesis, and then I had the Sega CD thing.  That was great.  So you were the one.  Yeah, the little attachment.  Remember the Jaguar?  I bought everything Sega.  You wanted Jaguar?  Yeah.  What was everyone else buying back then?  Nintendo.  Super Nintendo.  Super Nintendo.  N64.  Super duper Nintendo.  I don't think that was a console.  You do Atari?  Yeah.  You do Atari?  Atari.  I had Atari computers.  That stupid joystick.  I didn't like the 28...  The break?  Was it 2800? 
[03:08:00]  Atari 24.  The Atari, they didn't have the joystick figured out.  Broke all the fucking time.  You had to stick a pen in there.  And then you had to try to do some primitive fucking soldering as a kid to try to make it  work again.  I used to jig rig it with a pen.  I'd take a pen and shove it in the snapped off joystick.  And then...  No, I would break the connections.  The joystick would still be intact.  Yeah.  But it wouldn't move properly.  So then you would take it apart and try to put it back together.  Oh, a break inside?  Like internal breakage? 
[03:08:30]  Yeah, like the circuits and shit.  The little fucking...  That's bad.  The little circuits, circuit board or whatever the fuck it was.  Little wires?  I don't know.  I don't remember.  Sega CD really sucked.  They wanted you to believe that you were really going like through...  There was one.  It was you were going through these sewers in this like craft kind of a thing.  In these tunnels.  And you're supposed to shoot these little fucking creatures that were in there.  And you were supposed to believe that you were actually controlling the ship going through  these.  But you weren't.  Like the second you moved the joystick over, you had to hit the joystick left when you saw 
[03:09:00]  an arrow that blinked for left.  Right.  And then you'd be in that tunnel.  Oh.  So you're not really steering the thing.  You're just waiting for them to tell you.  Waiting for the prompt to...  What the next part of the game is.  To hit a button that would put you through a new tunnel.  Stunk.  You didn't have free will.  Yeah.  No free will with those games.  And then there were those video type games where you were in the sorority house or something  and there was supposedly a murder going on.  I think that was one of the last projects that that chick from Different Strokes that 
[03:09:30]  died.  Dana Plato?  Dana Plato did.  Yeah.  It was like this video thing.  And it was literally video clips of these girls going, I think he's in the closet.  You have to help me.  And then it would like freeze.  And then the closet where you come and play and it would open.  And you weren't doing anything really.  No.  I don't remember that at all.  Night trap.  That was it.  Night trap, motherfucker.  Yeah.  Look.  They're all jumping around.  Having a slumber party kind of thing.  Oh, boy.  Oh.  What is this fucking...  Wow.  That was a gummy broad. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  Look at this horrible...  When do they get to the box eating?  Dana Plato making her drug money.  Where's that?  Oh, it's her?  No.  She was on the couch.  Oh, I don't even know.  All right.  They're dancing and singing into a tennis racket.  But when does the game start?  Like, you'd be watching...  I swear you'd be watching video clips like this.  Right.  And go, what is this, a game? 
[03:10:30]  This is terrible.  It's the future.  It's a...  Yeah.  Wow.  It's full motion video in a game.  No, it's full motion video.  On a CD.  When do you get to the game, Paul?  Exactly.  What happens in this?  She's dancing, singing into a tennis racket.  So that's what's happening in the living room.  Right.  And then what happens?  Exactly.  Uh-oh.  Now guys show up.  Oh, boy.  So the horror starts.  And my gracious brother, Jeff. 
[03:11:00]  I think someone's taking control of the system.  What system?  We'll see if you can get it fixed.  Yeah.  If not, we'll have to do it the old-fashioned way.  Ooh, what's that?  I can take all weekend.  I got plans.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Come on, everyone.  I'll show you to your room.  Okay.  Oh, you know what that means.  Yeah.  Let the lesing out begin.  Some fucking muff is going to get all in.  That's right.  We all know what that means.  But that was the game.  You watched these videos.  And then you were waiting for something to do.  It was terrible. 
[03:11:30]  We could so go home right now with all that.  Yeah, we did so much fucking extra radio.  With the amount of entertainment we threw out.  No, no, no, extra radio we did this week.  We could so go home right now.  What do you mean extra radio?  Extra.  We went way past that a few days this week.  That's bonus, not extra.  That's extra.  You don't get rollover.  Extra, extra.  Yes, we do.  You watch how I fucking work that shit.  No.  Rollover.  12 minutes left to perform.  Mm-mm.  I mean, if you want, if you're looking for topics. 
[03:12:00]  I'm never looking for a topic.  He rocks the bone.  On the zone.  Oh, me and I were talking before the show.  Speaking of topics, we don't know how yet.  But we want to kind of keep the creativity coming in from the listeners.  Because we realized, holy fuck, we got some talented people out there.  We love their songs and things like that.  They're wonderful.  We're going to do the ONA audio contest.  We're going to wrap that up maybe next week.  Yeah.  That's the official contest.  We did the E-Rock portion yesterday.  But then after that, we're trying to figure out what to do next.  We're thinking maybe Christmas songs or something. 
[03:12:30]  Christmas songs would be great.  Very topical.  People love Christmas.  And they could be show-related.  Show-related Christmas songs?  Yeah.  Just a, yeah.  But we want original shit, not stuff that we've heard before that you can just grab  from somewhere else.  Be good.  Be goodly.  We're thinking maybe that direction, just to keep it going.  Because it was just too good.  It would be sad to just let that contest go.  Yeah.  So maybe we'll have details next week.  We'll try to figure it out.  What do you got over there?  What do you think of that? 
[03:13:00]  Hey, hey, you know something?  Ask any woman what she likes, what the best gift she ever got.  You know what she's going to say?  That engagement ring.  Is that true, Sam Roberts?  That's true.  Who recently bought an engagement ring.  We should ask Nicole.  Well, a long time ago at this point, the engagement ring.  It's a while back, but Jess.  We should ask Nicole.  You're right.  Why don't we ask Nicole from the morning mashup?  Does she...  She'd appreciate this read today.  When she looks at that engagement ring and that wedding ring and stuff...  Is she wondering where her husband was last night?  Does she look down and does he get credit like Steven Singer says? 
[03:13:30]  Does the beauty that goes into a Steven Singer engagement ring,  does it live up in marriage to the wonderfulness that was the service that you got from Steven Singer?  Right.  That guarantee...  You know what?  The ring's guaranteed through Steven Singer.  The marriage, not so much.  Marriage, not guaranteed.  Steven Singer has a guarantee.  Sam went to get her.  I don't know if she's coming, though.  How about free delivery with Steven Singer?  How about it?  How about that?  How about free delivery of brand new pussy to your husband? 
[03:14:00]  That's not a good thing.  Go online.  Go to IHateStevenSinger.com.  He'll help you out.  Sexy.  Right?  Yeah.  Usually don't go for that type.  You know what?  I don't know.  Steven Singer Jewelers.  Richie Mama.  Walked by.  He's got his 100% money back guarantee.  You get the best service value.  And it's that important, important gift.  That engagement ring.  It's so important, people.  And it's Steven Singer Jewelers. 
[03:14:30]  It's the perfect system.  Get that perfect ring.  Where are you going?  You're going to the other corner, Ethan Walnut.  On the phone?  You're going to IHateStevenSinger.  And online, it's IHateStevenSinger.com.  I see Sam's coming back here alone.  Much like she was sleeping last night when her husband didn't come home.  Nicole's busy for a moment.  She'll be in here in a second.  Oh, good.  Remember when we had Guy Fieri on the phone?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Remember when he said, he said, you said, what else do you have going on today?  Who else are you calling? 
[03:15:00]  Right.  What other press are you doing?  He said, no, that's it.  He just has to get his kids ready for school and one of his kids got his learner's permit.  Like as in, I'm not doing press today, but I wanted to make sure that I called my friends  the Opie and Anthony show.  Exactly.  Right.  Over an hour later, he's on the phone with the morning mashup as we speak.  He's literally there.  That's why she can't come in.  I hear they're hammering out a deal for morning mashed potatoes is what he wants to put in  his restaurant.  True?  False?  I don't know.  He lied. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  He lied again.  Oh, my husband didn't come home last night.  Onion rings.  Yes.  Yes.  Right.  It was supposed to be wordy assholes.  Yes.  How about some tuna on a lonely bed of lettuce?  That'd be nice.  The annulment burger.  Oh, an annulment burger.  Maybe one shrimp. 
[03:16:00]  Just one lonely shrimp.  Yeah.  All the dishes have to be very lonely and angry.  Oh, boy.  The big mistake.  Buffalo wings.  Oh, nice.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I hate your fucking guts, goulash.  Yeah.  Oh, that's...  See, I fucked another woman and pretended I was drunk sliders. 
[03:16:30]  That's a little long, but it's accurate.  We're just trying to sell some sliders.  That's true.  Yeah.  That's true.  Yeah.  Take this ring and shove it up your hash browns.  I like it.  I like it.  A little play there.  A little play.  Yeah.  They're hammering out all kinds of food deals.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where the hell was he if he stayed out all night?  You don't stay out all night at your guy friend's house. 
[03:17:00]  You always want to go home at some point.  Of course.  You want to leave your dumb friend's house.  You know what you don't want to leave?  Pussy.  You want to fuck something.  And it's like you got Nicole waiting for you at home.  So you just slovenly, drunkenly come in the door and fuck her or...  Roll her over like you're checking a corpse.  Right.  He fucked up because he just assumed she was going to be passed out.  Yeah.  And wouldn't know the difference.  Right.  Yes.  And then he comes home, gets into bed.  She's just like fucking...  And she regains consciousness and he's there. 
[03:17:30]  She doesn't need romance.  She came on the show the other day and said that he...  She said sleep raped her is what she said.  Oh, really?  She was literally sleeping and he just inserted himself into her.  All right.  So it's not like she needs romance.  He could just drunkenly come home and bang her.  But instead, he was putting it into somebody else.  Jesus Christ.  The facts are the facts.  It really is.  It's obvious.  How long do you give that marriage? 
[03:18:00]  Before proceedings.  Before the proceedings.  The proceedings.  This is their fifth month.  Oh, that's good.  Wow.  What's the fifth month?  Paper?  Do they make it to 12?  Here she is.  Oh, she's walking down the hall like, what?  What?  Can I hold the puppy again?  Yeah, but what?  We were supporting you.  We feel bad for you.  Yes.  We really feel bad for you.  You don't deserve this.  I'm on here and the only reason I just left is because Rich farted so bad that I couldn't breathe.  Oh, really?  Ugh.  You have to deal with those guys farting every day? 
[03:18:30]  Ugh.  Do girls hate farts?  No, they love them, Moby.  Well, we don't mind each other's farts.  We kind of giggle like idiots.  Yeah, it's not funny.  You don't giggle like an idiot when someone farts in the studio?  Can someone take a picture of Anthony with his dog?  He loves the dog.  I never knew he had such a paternal instinct.  He loves cute things.  I think they're adorable.  Why won't you get a dog?  You wouldn't?  Because he's got too many guns around.  Ah, they get hair on my...  She doesn't shed!  No, those type of dogs really don't shed.  She's so confused.  It's okay, Bibi.  You want to come here? 
[03:19:00]  There's a million dogs like that, Ant, that don't shed.  She's right.  Yeah.  Yeah, she doesn't shed.  She would love one of those.  That's a cute little dog.  Yeah, she's the best.  We'd have someone else do all the dumb stuff.  Look, it's little legs are inside the headphones.  Oh my God, yeah.  He loves it.  Apparently.  Every time he sees a kitten on TV, he loses his fucking mind.  Do you know who I'm talking to about this right now?  Uh-oh.  His ex-girlfriend.  Oh no!  You're discussing things with the ex?  She's a good friend of mine now.  Holy shit!  No!  Read the text messages, please.  You don't have to mention her name. 
[03:19:30]  No, I won't.  You can.  No, I'm not going to.  Yeah, let's hear some text.  It doesn't matter.  We don't need her name for them.  Between the new piece of shit and the old piece of shit are discussing.  Right.  Right.  No.  No, no, no.  I love her.  No, no, that's what he thinks.  So hold on.  Just to set up for the new people, your husband did not go home last night.  He said he got too drunk to come home and he slept at his friend's house.  Okay, so you're discussing with his ex.  She wrote just a general...  Because I was supposed to have dinner with her and a couple of my other girlfriends last night,  but I was too tired. 
[03:20:00]  Have you two lezzed out yet?  No.  She doesn't do that.  She wrote just a general comment on any husband not coming home, completely not acceptable  at all, ever.  I'm around if you need me.  Whoa.  She's laying down the law.  She knows a thing or two.  Who's this girl?  She's laying down the law.  Oh, that's my producer.  I need to go back.  What do you need to do over there?  I have a show!  You're not doing compelling radio.  This is actually compelling.  This will get you places.  This means something.  Right.  What gets you more responses?  When you come on here and talk about sex in your personal life or when you're like, 
[03:20:30]  hey!  When are you going to stop carrying that show and break out, do your own thing?  I don't know.  The show you want to do.  This show is...  Not that nonsense fluff shit.  This show is high protein, high energy, a lot of the food groups.  High protein?  Yes, and your show is potato chips.  It is.  It really is.  Yes.  Thank you.  Your show is gummy bears.  As soon as they hear your...  Right after they hear your voices, they forgot what you said.  You know that, right?  You do know that.  All right.  Screw you.  You're ready for this type of radio.  You really are.  I'm ready, but I mean, it's just not happening yet.  You get no kind of feedback on the talk breaks that you guys do. 
[03:21:00]  That's 100% untrue.  And the feedback I get from your listeners aren't always the nicest.  Yeah, but it's more.  And it's real, at least.  Yeah.  It's actually people.  Like when they call me a cunt, that's always so sweet.  Sometimes you act cunty.  No, I don't.  I'm a very nice girl who happens to have to go do my show right now.  Oh, man.  You want me to leave Phoebe here?  No, you could take it.  If we throw something on the floor, will you pick it up?  She gets all scared.  If I what?  If we throw something on the floor, will you pick it up?  Like what?  I don't know.  Just like a pen or something.  And for what reason?  Just throw something near the door.  Why do you want to do that? 
[03:21:30]  So you can see my ass?  Yeah.  I don't have an ass.  There's nothing to look at.  I have boobs.  I got the T and no A.  Then bend over frontwards.  I will not.  Could you pick that up?  Fuck yourself.  All right.  Anthony, give me the dog.  She really, I mean, you got to look at her when she leaves.  Can we keep the dog for a couple more minutes?  Yeah, leave the dog right here.  We'll babysit the dog.  We're good.  See?  She just threw the dog at us.  Look.  Look at her.  Oh, man.  There's no ass there.  No, I know.  That's off.  You take the pants off.  You don't know that.  I bet it looks a little better.  The dog is panicking.  It would look like Mick Jagger's ass. 
[03:22:00]  See, she just gave another look.  She just loves the dirty look.  The poor dog is looking like this.  Where's my mom?  Not Nicole.  Another girl just walked by.  Oh.  She just gave another dirty look.  Gave a dirty look?  I barely know you.  Relax.  Wow.  That fucking marriage is doomed.  So why don't we start our show?  It's doomed.  You want to start the show?  Yeah, look at this prep sheet.  We had some good stuff to talk about today. 
[03:22:30]  We didn't hit any of it.  No.  I do want to tell people that Norton's at the Addison Improv down there in the Dallas area.  Oh, right.  Great little club.  Cool staff.  Great room, man.  Um, yeah.  So make sure you go see Jimmy.  I got a plug, too.  Yes?  Yes.  Let's see.  What's going on here?  I don't want to see if Guy Fieri fucking tweeted that shit yet.  Oh.  Too busy on the phone with other shows.  What's the name of this fucking joint?  Does anyone know if Guy Fieri fucking did the tweet, we insisted he does, or we'll trash 
[03:23:00]  his restaurant?  You don't follow him?  Uh, yeah, I do, actually.  Oh, okay.  Let's see.  Um, I have a plug.  For real?  Yes.  Ooh.  12-23.  12-23.

[03:24:30]  Roland, uh...  Ew.  What's this?  Where?  It's a dog.  It's cute.  Look at it.  Roland, uh, Roland, our relationship with, uh, Guy Fieri is very fragile right now.  He told us he wasn't doing any more press and he's on the morning mashup.  This could get ugly quickly.  Roland, he's wagging his tail at you.  Do you like doggies?  I do.  Hot dogs.  Hey, bitch.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  I'm teasing.  Oh, I agree.  Yeah.  He does like hot dogs.  Corn dogs, hot dogs.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Make sure you get me some of that gravy this weekend. 
[03:25:00]  We'll see.  What is that going to cost me?  What kind of plug-o?  No plug-o?  Puppy dog.  Just casually mentioning in conversation?  Yeah.  I love this.  It's cute.  They're going to be on my food show.  Where it sounds like it's just kind of out of the blue.  Well, they're going to be on the food court.  Out of the fucking blue!  Travis?  No, I just want to listen to the show.  He's putting the headphones on.  Just want to listen to the show.  Why don't we get out of here?  I want to hear it like you guys hear it.  So we got Roland's show this weekend on the channel.  We got E-Rock's show.  And of course, the Brady side Dave. 
[03:25:30]  And can I tell you something?  Yes.  I was going to make it a surprise, but I have just booked a Chad Dukes phoner for today's  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Whoa!  So you're taking E-Rock's mystery guest before he is.  Ah, you fucking scum man!  In a way, I understand why he hates us.  But he does it to himself.  I got to get Chad Dukes' opinion on what's going on today.  Bravo!  That is fantastic.  Make sure you explain it so everyone's in.  Sam's a thinker.  That is great. 
[03:26:00]  Make sure you explain it.  Oh, and a scumbag.  Right.  An underhanded thing to do.  We talked about it on the show today.  After the show, what are we going to talk about, right?  Soften up the beaches for Bagel and with the Sex.  I'm not going to talk about Hurricane Sandy and video games with Chad Dukes.  No.  So we'll leave it open for Eric.  All right, y'alls.  Have a good weekend.  What a bunch of fucks.  Oh.  Oh, guess who's on the board!  Jesus.  Ah!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Jesus.  So!  I swear to God, there's not one job for him here. 
[03:26:30]  Not a one!  What job would you like here, Sal?  Maybe we could start there.  Left the board for two minutes.  What job would you like?  I want to continue doing mine for another week, please.  Another week.  You just want to keep yours for a little while.  But your ideal job for SiriusXM, what would it be?  The ONA show.  I only want to do the ONA show.  What for the show?  Yeah, what?  That's nice.  Because you said, I don't want to be on the air, I don't do this, I don't do that,  and you've done so many things poorly.  What is it that you want to do for this show? 
[03:27:00]  He gets coffee well.  Does he?  And he plugs in my iPad every morning pretty well.  I remember he got my ice pretty well.  Yeah.  Well, not every time, though, because he brought it back and it smelled.  That's right.  Yeah, yeah, fuck that.  You're right.  Fuck you.  No.  What do you want to do for this show?  Uh, I'd like to do, um, more production, probably.  Sal is a useless piece of shit.  Oh, you want to hear something?  Sal is a...  What?  I meant to, uh, okay, hold on. 
[03:27:30]  I meant to send this to the guys I forgot, so I'll just play it this way.  I meant to send this to the guys I forgot, so I'll just play it this way. 
[03:28:00]  I can't believe I never knew how pretty you are.  Stand there looking all pretty and she is.  Can't believe I never knew how pretty you are.  Stand there looking all pretty and she is.  I didn't see it as a rap.  Why would he not know how pretty she is?  I'll send it to you guys so you can play it for real on Monday.  I didn't...  That was, uh, that was Zeps.  Yeah, I didn't see it as a rap.  That's Zeps from the E-Rock Audio Contest.  I like seeing Chip delve into, um, other, uh, musical genres than just his basic hardcore rock. 
[03:28:30]  There's a special surprise for you outside the door.  I'm not talking to anybody today.  I'm out of here.  It's probably important.  He loves it.  I'm going to the gym.  We gave him a great week of radio.  Leave us the fuck alone.  Great week.  Don't fucking, you know, bring us down with your shit.  Don't bring me down. 
[03:29:00]  Don't.  Yeah, exactly.  Can we play some Stones to head out of here?  Oh.  What do you want to hear?  I'm not in there.  Oh, no.  Actually, it don't matter because I won't be able to hear it.  I'll just play Stones while you're home.  I can't believe...  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  You wanted to end the show with the Rolling Stones.  Yeah.  And you're just giving up on it because Sal's behind the door.  No, I got it already.  I got the Stones already.  Oh, do you?  What Stones song would you play, Sal?  Hopefully Kidney. 
[03:29:30]  What Stones song would you play?  He doesn't have it ready.  Time to light.  Cindy had it ready.  Yeah, you do have it ready.  What were you going to push?  Oh, no.  I just brought up the whole library of the Stones.  They have hundreds and hundreds of songs.  I'm going to go with Painted Black.  Time to light.  All right.  You know what?  Sort of.  No, there's not an official right answer, but that one's not going to piss off too many  people.  No, you're right.  All right.  Play that.  Fuck it.  Fuck it.  Um. 
[03:30:00]  I see a red door and I want it painted black.  No colors anymore.  I want them to turn black.  I see the girls will find dressed in their summer clothes. 
[03:30:30]  I have to turn my head until my darkness goes.  I see a line of cars and they are painted black.  With flowers and my love broke never to come back.  I see people turn their heads and quickly look away.  Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day. 
[03:31:00]  I look inside myself and see my heart is black.  I see my red door and I must have it painted black.  Maybe then I'll fade away and I'll tend to face the facts.  It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black.  No more will my green seagull turn a deeper blue. 
[03:31:30]  I could not foresee this thing happening to you.  If I look hard enough into the setting sun.  My love will laugh with me before the morning comes.  I see a red door and I want it painted black.  I see a red door and I'm black.  No colors anymore.  I want them to turn black. 
[03:32:00]  I see the girls will find dressed in their summer clothes.  I have to turn my head until my darkness goes.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Let's go. 
[03:32:30]  Let's go.  I want to see a man  Clean and black  Black at night  I don't know, I want to see the sun  Flotted out from the sky  I want to see a baby, baby, baby, baby black  Yeah 
[03:33:00]  I want to see the sun 
[03:33:30]  Hey, hey, hey  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues  This is After ONA Live  Here's your host, Sam Roberts  Nicole's never coming back for that stupid dog  It's still here  Hey, can we try to get Eric on the phone? 
[03:34:00]  It's After Opie and Anthony Live  He texted me while we were on commercial break  And he wrote, you are dick  I would assume that he meant you are a dick  But I would like to know what I did to him  Before we get Chad Dukes on the phone  Let's try to get Eric on the phone  I'm assuming at some point we'll hear from Nicole  From the morning mashup  Because she left her dog here  And I've told Troy that if the dog is not  Accounted for by 11am  We're having it euthanized 
[03:34:30]  I'll do it  You're going to euthanize it yourself?  Yeah  Are you trained?  No  I saw a Discovery Channel episode on it  Discovery Channel did a show about euthanizing dogs  No  I didn't think so  That sounded a bit far-fetched to me  So I don't know if we're going to get Eric on the phone  But I saw it  They're trying  Basically Eric's show is coming up  After Roland's show  We're doing a two-hour block of programming on Saturday  It's going to be 5pm Eastern time of course  It's going to be Roland's food court 
[03:35:00]  He's got an hour  And then at 6pm Eastern time  On Saturday  This Saturday  On this channel  It's going to be Eric's show  Which he decided to call  Bagel in with the sex  We found out  Like he's been hyping  And you heard him on the after show  Hopefully earlier this week  Talking about a surprise guest that he had  He's been hyping  Saying I have a surprise guest  He won't tell anyone who it is  He wouldn't tell Sal who the guest was  He wouldn't tell  Roland  He wouldn't tell you, right?  He told me  He goes  He leaned back on the show  He goes  Someone big  Right  So you didn't know who it was 
[03:35:30]  No, but then Opie said  Find out  So I had to do what he said  Sal, who worked as his executive producer  Didn't know who he was  Yeah, Sal asked him to text it to him  And he said no  So then he texts Opie last night  And he invites Opie to his show  That he's doing on Saturday  Eric  And says  Well, I have a surprise guest  And he's a fan of yours  You've never met him before  And Opie goes  Oh, okay  That's intriguing  Who is this?  And E-Rock will not tell him  Who the surprise guest is  Because of that  If he would have told him  I wouldn't have to find out 
[03:36:00]  Because Opie would go  Stop trying to make excuses  No, no  I'm just doing  Just for once  Just say  I went and found out  Because I thought it would be funny  No  It was your idea  No, it wasn't  He said  Can you find out?  I go, yes  Whatever  I mean, Roland is again  Not taking blame for something  But  Hey, the boss says  Can I find out?  I go, yeah  Roland went and found out  Who the guest was  I did Google  I did Google each name  There were six names  I keep on trying to call Eric  He's not picking up  But I will continue  Why is it?  He just texted me  I know he's awake  I don't know 
[03:36:30]  Like, wouldn't this just be easier  If he would just talk?  Like, Eric always thinks  That running away  Is going to make things easier  Ignoring it doesn't make it go away  On this show  I don't know  Like, maybe that's  How he's learned to deal with bullies  It's not like he doesn't know  The number that he's calling from  Right  He texted me  You are dick  Which I, again  I assume that meant  You are a dick  But I don't know for sure  But you are a dick  For doing it  Roland, just take blame  For once in your life  I take blame when I do stuff  You went and found out who it was  Because, can you find out who it is? 
[03:37:00]  I go, yes, I can  You didn't write a note that said  Here he is  Okay  Is this him, Sal?  Yeah, but the phone's got kind of fucked up  See if you can answer it  Okay  You there, Eric?  Yeah  Okay, why did you text me and say I'm a dick?  Because  I only woke up about 9.40  And  And by the way  Before anyone tries to bust balls  This is your scheduled vacation day  Yeah, I'm not here for a while  So  I  My phone has all these texts and stuff  They had the phone off  And they're saying 
[03:37:30]  Wow, Sam's a dick  Sam gets to move under the bus  Sam  And I'm like, what the fuck?  So I'm trying to piece shit together  And then I'm hearing the very last of the show  To  People telling me that you told them who  Like one of my surprise guests are  Again, you never trust these idiot listeners  Because they  For some reason the listeners  I guess I've conditioned them  To think a certain way  But they don't  The people who texted you that  Have no free thinking brain of their own  Because  I didn't know who your surprise guest was  Until Roland came in here with a note 
[03:38:00]  Saying  It's Chad Dukes  Yeah, because Opie told me to find out who  So Opie  Here's the story, Eric  Because you were asleep  Opie  You have your big show on Saturday  And you were hyping up this surprise guest  A little bit  Alright, well hold on  Hold on, hold on  Yeah, go ahead  If it wasn't you  If it wasn't you  Right  Then okay  Apology number one  I am sorry that I said you're a dick  Okay  Number two  I apologize to  Actually no, I don't apologize  I blame nobody but myself  That I invited Opie to stop by to that show 
[03:38:30]  Yeah, that's what happened  Opie got your texts  And you were telling him you have a secret guest  So then Opie gets on the air  And starts saying  You know  Eric's being vague again  He's got some secret guest  Who he says is a fan of mine  And I don't know who he is  And you know  He's inviting me to come in  I don't know  Blah, blah, blah  And I said  What I told you  To your face  Which was  I don't know who it is  He won't tell me  He won't tell Sally  He won't tell anybody  But I'm sure it's going to be a letdown  Which was  You know, whatever  Of course  I wasn't even hyping up 
[03:39:00]  This special guest  Well  Not telling people  That wasn't even the main talking point  For when I had to promote this stupid show  Yeah, but not telling people  Who the guest was  Like saying  I have a surprise guest  And I will not tell anybody  Who it is  That's  That's the hype  No, it's not the hype  Yes, it is  That's what hype is  And two  Because anything that gets done around here  Everyone tries to destroy everything  So this way  It was like  I'll leave one of these things out  No, no, no  Because you  Don't worry about it  You came on the after show 
[03:39:30]  And said  I have a surprise guest  And then you texted Opie  And said  I have a surprise guest  So that was one of your things  You're like  I'm talking about  Hurricane Sandy  The video game thing  And I have a surprise guest  And at that point  We all are trying to guess  Who is the surprise guest  Who is the surprise guest  And that's  And I told you  And I said  Don't worry about it  Yeah, but that's the hype  I wasn't saying it like  Oh my god  This is such a big guest  I can't tell you  No, because if you had said  My buddy Chad Dukes  Is coming in from DC  And he's just going to hang out  For the show  Then it would have been like 
[03:40:00]  Oh, cool  So how did Roland find out then?  He went to security  Of course  Or he went through the talent booker  I don't know  All he said was  Talent bookers have access to everything  I'm assuming they went to security  But I don't  Talent bookers work in very mysterious ways  And they control a lot around here  So I don't know for sure  But I'm assuming  That, you know  The talent bookers  Become aware of everybody  Who's coming in this building  Correct, Roland?  Correct  So Roland went  And knew that he could  Indeed  He had the resources  To find out 
[03:40:30]  Who was coming in here  In the weekend  Assuming they had been registered  Which they had  Obviously  They have to be  And he found out  That Chad Dukes  Was your surprise mystery guest  See, that's weird  Because that name  Wasn't even on the list  Yeah, but  I was trying to figure that out  You know what happened?  Chad Dukes' real name  Was on the list  Not his name  Chad Dukes  But Chad  And then his real last name  I don't know if he gives that out or not  So Roland  Saw the real name  He's a smart guy, Roland  I mean, he can't talk 
[03:41:00]  But he's a smart guy  And so he put two and two together  And said  That's the name  And he started googling  And figuring out  Who Chad Blank was  And came back  By the way  The fact that Chad Dukes  Has a fake name  Is like  Come on  Like, you don't need a fake name  But  Yeah, so that's  And then he said  Oh  Chad Blank  Is Chad Dukes  E-Rock's Twitter buddy  The radio guy from D.C.  That's the secret guest  It was Roland's detective work  And then Opie 
[03:41:30]  Is the one who officially  Added his name  But it was Roland's  Detective work  That  And Opie said  Go find out who  That uncovered this mystery  Okay  Like  And I said this on the air  And I think Opie was making  The same point  I don't think Chad Dukes  Is a bad guy  Like, I don't think it's bad  That you're having him  On the show  Like, I think  Having Chad sit in with you  Could be a great move  Because he's a guy  Who knows how to host  A talk show  He's done this before  He's a funny guy  He's talented  He's a talented 
[03:42:00]  And I've said this on the air  Like, we've talked to him  Once or twice  On the after show before  And I've said  Him  Cowhead  There's a very small  Handful of guys  In terrestrial radio  That I think  All of us recognize  As those are talented guys  And Chad Dukes  Is one of them  The problem  I didn't hear  I didn't hear earlier  But it sounds like  You're backpedaling  No, no, no  Not at all  No  I said this in the beginning  The problem that we all had  Was  That you  Not  Saying that you had  A mystery guest  Right away 
[03:42:30]  Leads  That's going to be  The buzz of the show  Everybody wants to find out  Who this mystery guest is  You watch wrestling  Eric, correct?  Yes  Okay  When they say  But also  Wrestling doesn't ruin  The surprise  Until it happens  But there is no surprise  The surprise  When they say  The big show  Is going to have  A mystery opponent  After this commercial break  And then  You stay tuned  And you're waiting  During the commercial break  You're thinking to yourself  I can't wait to find out  Who this mystery guest  Is going to be  And then they come back  From break 
[03:43:00]  And it's this guy  That you've never heard of  And you're like  Why the fuck  Or it could have been  Hey, Hulk Hogan's  The third member of NWO  Yeah, but it wasn't  Because it was Chad Dukes  Yeah, you don't know  I know, but you can't  Everyone there  Has to fucking ruin everything  But no, it's ruined  When it's a surprise  Like, when the surprise  Is something  That, it's a letdown  Like, you can't  Lead people  And be like  Oh, wait till you see  What's going to happen  And then you start  Your show with a letdown  Or how about  You know what  Look, they've got to 
[03:43:30]  Do something  Leave it alone  And leave it as it is  And we'll see what happens  But do you not  Do you not get  Our point that you  Hyped  Because you hyped it up  When you said  You had a mystery guest  That's just a natural  I didn't hype it up  That's a natural hype  And I said nobody  You, no, no, no, no  You said you had  A mystery guest  You said I have  A mystery guest  It was on the air  First of all  You did say it on the air  You said it on the after show  That was later on  This week  When you brought it up  That's what I'm talking about  This week  You said you had  A mystery guest  You said you had  A mystery guest 
[03:44:00]  And you wouldn't  Tell anyone who it is  You wouldn't tell  Any of us behind the scenes  Who it was  So everybody's like  Now there is a big mystery  If you had said  It's not a mystery  It's Chad Dukes  He's just a guy I know  Who does good radio  Then it's like  Oh, okay  That's fine  Then that's what  You can leave alone  But once there is  A mystery  People want to solve  The mystery  When there's a mystery  That's not something  You leave alone  It's something  That you try to solve  You know what I mean?  You guys are all  You have to 
[03:44:30]  All of you have to  Ruin everything  But what's ruined?  There's other shit involved  With some stuff  Going on here  And you guys have to  Fucking ruin everything  You're doing it again though  You're doing the vagaries again  There's other shit  I can't talk about  Certain shit  Asshole  Why  What can't you talk about?  Then  Why don't I just tell you then?  I'm not fucking telling you  Because then it's  The shit involved  None of you guys business  And you guys  Gotta fuck everything up  It is our business 
[03:45:00]  Because you go on this channel  And you say  I have a mystery guest  And then you text Opie  And you say  I have a mystery guest  It's not ruining it  It's saying  We're finding out who it is  There's no ruining it  Because it's not a good surprise  It's a bad surprise  It's like  If the surprise is  Chad Dukes is hanging out with me  Then the list  It's a surprise for you maybe  But not for other people  The listeners  That's a terrible surprise for the listeners 
[03:45:30]  Because they don't know who Chad Dukes is  Because you said so  No because nobody knows who he is  People know who he is  Nobody knows who he is Eric  Anthony didn't know who he was  Anthony doesn't know anybody  Anthony knows everybody  Alright  Travis  Do you know who Chad Dukes is  Yeah  But only because  Eric tweets him wrestling stuff  Okay  Troy  Do you know who Chad Dukes is  No  No people don't know who Chad Dukes is  He's a talented guy  But he's not a guy  Who people know who he is  Here's the thing  That Eric's not understanding  Nobody wanted  Or planned 
[03:46:00]  To ruin any sort of surprise  No  I think  What happened was  You were so unnecessarily vague  With Opie  That he had to bring it to the show  And when he  And when  Eric went on the air  And said I have a mystery  And if I wasn't vague  He would have came on and said  Oh guess what  Here it is  So either way  I'm fucked  But you're not fucked  No probably not  Because it wasn't such a big deal  And you're not fucked  If you just say  I'm doing the show with Chad Dukes  Like there's nothing  That you're fucked about  With that  If you're just like  Chad Dukes is the guy  I'm doing the show with  He's my guest  Then people would be like 
[03:46:30]  Oh that could be cool  Or  Oh that's going to be lame  But it doesn't  I honestly don't  It's not a big deal  If Eric had said  Oh I have a special guest  And Opie had said  Who is it  Oh Chad Dukes  Wants to meet you  Please don't tell anybody  Opie probably wouldn't tell anybody  Because who cares  Oh bullshit  He would have anyway  You probably wouldn't even have to say  Don't tell anybody  Because nobody cares  Opie's not going to come on the air  And be like  Oh I just found out  E-Rock's guest is going to be Chad Dukes  Because the audience doesn't know who he is  Sam you knew on Thursday 
[03:47:00]  That he had a surprise guest  You didn't find it  You didn't say  Oh I want to fuck this up  He said on Wednesday  That he had a mystery guest  And once the conversation was over  And he said  I'm not telling anybody  It was done  Nobody woke up this morning  Saying let's ruin Eric's surprise guest  I did zero research  To figure out who this mystery guest was  All I said was  I'm sure it's going to be a letdown  And you're right  I was right  But what I'm saying  You know why  You asked who knows  Of Dukes right  Who knows this 
[03:47:30]  And I know  I know Chad  I've heard the name Chad Dukes  But you want to know  Why I know the name  Because I'm in the fucking business  And people in D.C. know who Chad Dukes is  Yeah  But I'm in the business  Like if you went up to somebody  Like Sam  If you're going to have like a wrestling show  Right  And you're like  I got this guy  I got a great guest  And then like  You just name some like  Arbitrary like wrestling guy  That like you know  No one's ever heard of  You don't know who he is  But you're treating it like  It's this huge guest  Because to you it's huge  To you it's huge  Because that's your thing  So I think for Eric  Like it's a radio guy  You know how excited Eric gets about radio  Like you know  But that's his world 
[03:48:00]  So I think for Eric  I think for him it's a big deal  And he doesn't realize  That this does not matter  To anybody else  So Danny you're saying that like  He doesn't realize  The world outside of himself  Is just not aware  Of what's going on in radio  And not everybody gives a fuck  About just some radio  Some local radio person  From another state  That's one of the reasons  Why I wasn't promoting it  Yes you were  You said you had a mystery  No I got a side  Eric I don't mean to interrupt  But like the way that it was being  Presented at least  In the text messages  That Opi was getting  In the air  It seemed like this was 
[03:48:30]  To be some kind of a big deal  Because you know what  If the spot was never blown  And then you know  Here we are  And it's Saturday night  And it's the big sex  And with the bag show  Or bagging with the sex  I'm sorry  I keep doing that  But if it's time  And it's like okay  And I'm the fuck  You know in studio  We got chat  I'd be like what the fuck  But if he had said originally  My buddy who does radio in DC  His name's Chad Dukes  He's gonna come do the show  With me and hang out  It would have been like  Okay  That's cool  You know what I would have  Texted Opi  I would have said  Hey my buddy Chad's coming down 
[03:49:00]  He's a big fan  If you're around on Saturday  He'd like to meet you  Like  E-Rock  You know  That if you did  Chad Dukes' show  Most of Chad Dukes' audience  Wouldn't know who you are  Right?  I don't know  Probably yes  Okay  You're more famous  Than Chad Dukes'  Yeah  Just say it Eric  You know you are  I'm more famous  Than Chad Dukes'  And if I did  Chad Dukes' show  Nobody would know  Who I was  Because  You're not very famous  And I'm not very famous  But Chad Dukes'  Is less famous 
[03:49:30]  Unless you're in  Washington DC  And listen to  Washington DC radio  See this is the shit  I was trying to avoid here  By saying  I had a mystery guest  Well one of the mystery guests  And I'm not talking about it  Why pick someone like Chad Dukes  To be a mystery guest?  Right right right  Why is it a mystery?  When no one's gonna give a fuck  About the reveal  It's not an issue  That he's a guest  Cause he's talented  He's a talented broadcaster  If it was my birthday  And you surprised me  By getting me one chicken nugget  That's not a big surprise  I wouldn't give a fuck 
[03:50:00]  I'd be like oh gee  It's delicious  And you'd enjoy it  Angry about  I'm not angry  Because you  You're very frustrating  Because you're not listening  When you say  Mystery guest  That gets everybody's hopes up  Right  You don't need to go around  And be like  Wait till you hear  Wait till you hear  Once you say  I do have a mystery guest  And I'm not telling anyone  Who it is  It's built in hype  Yeah and you  You wanted  When you were texting  With Ope  Like you wanted  That mystery there  Because you wanted  It to be more  Than what it was  Like you wanted that  You were trying to 
[03:50:30]  Fishing  You were fishing  You were trying to  Fish it out  Like you wanted him  To be like  Oh who is this  Who's this guy  You were making it that  So you can't now  Get on the air  And say that you  Weren't trying to do that  Because you  Absolutely were  Do you understand  What the issue is  That we're having  Or do you still think  That we're off  No I understand  The issue that you're having  Okay and  Do you  Get that like  This is  That Chad Dukes  Is not a bad guest  But he is a bad  Mystery guest  Yeah no one's  Shitting on Chad Dukes 
[03:51:00]  Yeah  He's a  I've said it a hundred times  He's a talented broadcaster  But he's a terrible mystery guest  He's fine  But he's fine  Until you put him  Behind a sparkly curtain  Like I was expecting  The mystery guest  To be a letdown  Just because  Like I didn't think  It was going to be  Like a big A-lister  And I was  Even though I was  Expecting a letdown  I was still let down  Because that's how big  Of a letdown it was  Because he's not  A famous guy  And people don't know  Who he is  Our listeners don't know  Who Chad Dukes is  Like some  A very select few of them do  Like you have to understand 
[03:51:30]  Eric  Like the way our listeners  Work  A lot of our listeners  Don't know who I am  Because they just tune in  For the Opie and Anthony show  A lot of our listeners  Don't know who you are Eric  Because they just tune in  It's just radio  Like they know  Who Opie and Anthony  And Jim are  You know  Most of our listeners  Probably know who you  And I are  But I guarantee you  That the percentage  Of listeners  Who have any idea  Who Chad Dukes is  Is minuscule  That's why Eric 
[03:52:00]  Didn't want to make  A big deal about it  And that's why  That's why  As a mystery guest  It's insane  The whole point  Was that  It was no big deal  I wasn't hyping this up  Now the second  The second  That you  The second you  Made it a secret  You were hyping it  Yeah but  But do you  Get that when you  Say I have a mystery guest  You're automatically  Hyping something  Yep 
[03:52:30]  Like that's  Regardless of who it is  Like if you  If you had said  I have Chad Dukes  Coming in  It's no big deal  That's not hyping that up  That's just saying it  So we know  And it's like oh cool  But if you say  It's no big deal  But I have a mystery guest  Coming in  There's immediate hype  To that  Because people tune in  Wanting to find out  The mystery  A mystery  As I said  Is not something  You leave alone  A mystery is something  You actively try to solve  Would you watch  What's that renovation show 
[03:53:00]  Where they move the bus  Extreme home makeover  Would you watch it  If they moved the bus  Up front  Like  They just parked it  In the driveway  Like during the opening credits  They're moving the bus  Would you stick around  No  The whole purpose of a mystery  Is just like ooh  Who is it  Now I need to find out  That's the point  That you do that for  I get what you're saying Eric  That you never intended this  To be like an A-list guest  I  Completely understand that  But do you understand  That by saying you have  A mystery guest  It's automatic hype 
[03:53:30]  For something that  Will be a letdown  Fine  If you said you had  A mystery guest  And then it was Kevin Smith  That would still be a letdown  I don't know  Some people would be excited  About Kevin Smith  Danny's  That's the second  By the way  That's  That's  That's the second  Kevin Smith  That's the second  Before you get yourself  In trouble  He agrees  That's the second time  Danny's taking a shot  At Kevin Smith  On the after show  I'm keeping track  Don't worry  I'm sure  He's doing way better  Than me  Trust me  He's not hurting  Nothing I can say 
[03:54:00]  Will ever hurt his feelings  A great surprise guest  Would be somebody  That's never been  On the show before  That's just like  Wow  Honestly all joking aside  Kevin Smith  Would be a great surprise guest  On Eric's show  On Eric Nagel's radio show  Yes  He would  That would be like  What  That's crazy  Winnie  From fucking  That you interviewed yesterday  Danica McKellar  If she  If he showed up  She showed up to Eric's show  I'd be like  Oh that's fucking cool  I agree  Like holy shit  He's got Winnie in the studio  So you're saying  That my show  That's on Sundays  At 4pm Eastern  Yeah  Where I'm interviewing  Winnie Cooper 
[03:54:30]  This Danica McKellar  But it's recorded  He gets her to come in live  If I had said  I have a mystery guest  For the show  Then people would have been like  Oh cool  Yeah but you always have  Big guests on  It's true  So it's nothing to have that  And you know what  And then when people found out  That it was what's her face  From the Wonder Years  No one's gonna  I don't think anybody's gonna go  Oh that was it  Yeah  They'd be like  Oh my holy shit  They'd be like  Oh yeah Winnie Cooper  I love Winnie Cooper  Yeah  And then she'd have  Held it off as a mystery  And you're like  God damn she looks hot  Right  You know  Which by the way  In her picture  She looks really hot 
[03:55:00]  Banging right  She looks great  Yeah  What are you thinking Eric  About how we're really confused  I'll be listening  There you go  Sunday  Not Saturday  People get confused  Whatever  But I got some good news for Eric  What's that  Cause I've been working on his production  It's awesome  His open sounds fucking epic  Eric I think it's a good move  Having Chad Dukes in  Because  He's a guy who knows  How to do talk radio  I'm not saying  That I think you're gonna have a bad show  I don't think you're gonna have a bad show  Necessarily  Oh you just  But  Like I'm not sitting here being like 
[03:55:30]  Chad Dukes  This show is gonna suck  No  That doesn't  That's not at all what that means  What I'm saying is  It's crazy  To say that you have a mystery guest  And for it to be Chad Dukes  Did Eric invite a radio guy to his show  So that there would be someone  Who would know how to do radio  Oh Danny  Well Eric  To be  I mean  That's terrible  That's a bit  Eric doesn't know how to do talk radio  Oh  Have you done  Eric have you hosted a talk radio show before  Um  Well there was that Scott show  That he was doing  Right 
[03:56:00]  So you don't  I mean it's not  It's not where your expertise lines  It's only one hour  We could've handled it  We got Chad Dukes  Okay  Chad Dukes is gonna help him out  That's the mystery  Do you have any other mysteries  For the show Eric  No  Doesn't matter  Like board ops coming in or anything  You alright buddy  Yeah  I think you took some of the wind  Out of the sail  For tomorrow  To the show  The show is gonna be great  I think so  The show is gonna be great  I mean based on the open
