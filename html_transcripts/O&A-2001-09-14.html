<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast immediately following the September 11th attacks was a raw and emotionally charged response to the tragedy.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, abandoned their usual antagonistic banter, instead expressing shared feelings of anger, sadness, and numbness.  They noted the unusual quiet in their studio due to the lack of calls and described the somber atmosphere in New York City, observing the prevalence of American flags and the unexpected civility between strangers.  They also commented on the absurdity of some post-attack events, such as people selling pictures of the burning Twin Towers and a woman wearing a "Terror at the Towers" T-shirt while searching for a loved one, prompting angry commentary about those profiting from the tragedy.  A brief comedic respite was offered by playing a segment of a poorly performed Rocco wedding bit.  Discussion included Al Sharpton's perceived lack of support for the police, President Bush's speeches, and Reverend Billy Graham's sermon, with Opie expressing discomfort with Graham's religious message.

Numerous callers shared their experiences. A New Yorker detailed being in the World Trade Center the day before the attack; someone from Philadelphia described the overwhelming support and donations being sent to New York; and “Psycho Mark,” a New York City police officer, provided live updates on rescue efforts and the massive military presence in Manhattan, including the President's arrival by helicopter.  Technical difficulties hampered an attempt to play a clip of Vince McMahon's post-attack SmackDown speech.  Other callers shared their reactions and updates on aid efforts in various cities.  The broadcast also included a caller, Melissa, who praised their coverage and recounted a disturbing incident of Arab Americans delivering supplies being assaulted.

Pete Radovich of CBS Sports called in, expressing anger at the media's coverage, criticizing the inclusion of hijackers in death tolls, self-serving near-miss narratives, and speculative reporting.  The hosts discussed Jerry Falwell's controversial comments blaming various groups for the attacks and brainstormed ideas for a listener-driven fundraising effort.  Fran called in, sharing her husband's harrowing escape from the World Trade Center and the subsequent trauma.  The show discussed the lasting impact of the event, Hollywood's inability to surpass the real-life drama, and the cancellation or postponement of several movies.  WWE personalities' reactions were played, including those of Vince McMahon, The Rock, Stone Cold Steve Austin, and Stephanie McMahon, whose comments were met with derision. Callers provided personal accounts, including a description of the Pentagon aftermath and updates from the ground. A Wall Street caller offered a historical perspective on market reactions to major conflicts.  The broadcast concluded with more calls discussing the presidential visit to Ground Zero and aid delivery logistics.


A significant portion of the broadcast featured WWF personalities' reactions, ranging from serious to bizarre and comedic.  Bradshaw's Holocaust comparison and Stephanie McMahon's comments were particularly discussed and mocked.  Several callers shared personal experiences: one whose aunt was missing but later found unconscious; “Joe,” who worked at Ground Zero, detailing the gruesome recovery efforts and urgent need for supplies; and a Washington, D.C. caller describing the widespread impact.  Other calls included an oddly patriotic encounter near a Revolutionary War battlefield and a call from frequent caller "Lady Di," prompting some lighthearted, potentially insensitive jokes from the hosts.  Jim Norton also contributed. The show concluded with a humorous segment involving "Patty," a recurring caller known for her obsessive behavior, with the hosts playfully debating whether she was a friend or a stalker.


Another segment began with a humorous, albeit bizarre, segment with "Patty," the persistent caller.  The majority of this portion focused on listeners expressing grief, anger, and support for rescue workers.  Callers praised Rudy Giuliani while harshly criticizing Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer. Several shared personal experiences, including a caller whose father died at the Pentagon.  The disruptive calls of “Medical Marijuana Barbie,” promoting her anti-police and anti-Bush coloring book, prompted significant annoyance from the hosts, who destroyed the books on air.  Other callers shared stories of bomb threats, evacuations, and rescue efforts, with one detailing the grueling work at Ground Zero and the need for gloves.  Callers included comedians discussing how to approach their work, and a segment featured Jesse Ventura.


Finally, a segment focused heavily on listener calls, including Lorenzo describing the scene near the World Trade Center; Psycho Mark detailing his terrifyingly close proximity and using homophobic slurs while criticizing other radio stations; a Marine Sergeant expressing patriotic sentiment; Fabio agreeing with Psycho Mark's criticism; Melissa initially disliking the show but expressing fear and anger, later revealing she's a real estate agent and becoming a listener; a caller recounting the assault of Arab men delivering supplies; Derek, a Marine Corps veteran, expressing conflicted emotions; Tom, an 18-year military veteran, discussing military preparedness and presidential response; Mark, a songwriter, offering his song "Bomb That Terrorist Land"; Vangie criticizing a local radio station's commercial; and Lou describing a double rainbow as a symbol of hope. The broadcast was characterized by raw, emotional reactions, interspersed with hosts' commentary, frequent interruptions, and offensive language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hello.  We are here.  A few phone numbers to give out right away.  New York.  The New York area, if you want in today.  877-692-1027.  And anywhere else that we broadcast to.  866-2774.  Wow, that's 866-2774.  Wow.  How are you, my friend?  All right.  Yeah?  Yeah, you know.  Muddling through.  So, there's not much else going on, you know? 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, it's strange at this point.  I think it's going to get a lot better after the weekend.  It would be nice for people to start calling our office again.  What do you mean?  It's like a, it's just really quiet back there, you know?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  There's nobody, like, calling up to come on the show.  No, no business is going on, which is understandable.  But it would be nice to get a call here and there.  Yeah, you know?  I guess, I guess we'll, like I said, after the weekend or maybe when we start bombing 
[00:01:00]  somebody, I think it might get a little better.  When does that start?  Tomorrow, you think?  I don't know.  I don't know if it'll be tomorrow.  I think, I think by next week.  Today's the day of mourning and how ironic it's, it's raining in New York.  That's disgusting now.  It's just a creepy, creepy day here in New York.  They had, earlier today, they had that memorial service down in Washington that the president  was at and a bunch of the former presidents. 
[00:01:30]  And they had the, what song was playing?  They had a whole choir singing the, what the hell was it?  The Battle Hymn of the Republic.  And the traffic was so bad on the BQE, right at the part where you're next to the, you're  under the promenade and there's nothing but the East River between you and Manhattan.  So you got a clear view.  And there's, you know, the battlefield right there and the Battle Hymn of the Republic playing. 
[00:02:00]  Looking around, everyone in their vehicles are crying.  Just crying.  It's like, Jesus Christ.  No one's going to feel better.  I don't know.  You know.  I'm feeling, I'm feeling a lot of good out there, Anthony.  There are so many American flags in the streets of New York.  It's, it's, it's unbelievable.  It really is.  Yeah, but it just makes you feel crappy for the reason that they're there.  You know?  It just makes you feel like crap.  I'm like more bummed today than I was yesterday. 
[00:02:30]  Still just as pissed off.  Emotion level, let's see.  Still just as pissed off.  More bummed.  More bummed?  Yeah.  More bummed.  Why?  Because it's all starting to sink in?  Yeah, it's just been sinking in.  I'm tired of having to deal with it.  You know?  I'm just sick of it.  It doesn't go away.  There's nowhere to go.  You know, we, we took about a half hour out of this misery in the office today to throw  in a tape of Rocco from AAF's wedding bit that he did. 
[00:03:00]  And we were laughing at that for all the wrong reasons because it was so bad.  So it was great though.  It got us away from this whole thing for a few minutes.  It's so bad.  That's the only entertainment.  That was the only entertainment.  It was finally something, you know, was there to make us laugh.  It was so entirely bad.  After yesterday's show, you know, I've had my Walkman for the last four days.  I never bring a Walkman into New York. 
[00:03:30]  Never, ever, ever.  But, you know, I've been listening to radio nonstop.  And last night, you know, I didn't want to, I didn't want to, I had to get away.  So I read a little article on Kurt Cobain on the ride home.  Did you?  On the train.  It's kind of, I want to say hi to everyone I've met on the train the last two days.  Unbelievable.  Everyone is talking to everyone in this city.  Yeah, it's disgusting.  It really is.  I mean, you'll know everything's back to normal or as normal as we can be when we can just  go back to the fine art of hating each other like we did before this happened. 
[00:04:00]  Well, that's not used to word hate.  There's enough hate going around.  I know, but, you know, I'm a realist over here.  I remember what it was like before Tuesday.  Everyone's just miserable.  But that's who we are, you know.  That's how it was walking around town, just miserable.  Get out of my way.  You're not walking on the sidewalk fast enough.  Stop snapping your picture, you goddamn tourist.  Cab, taxi driver, get the hell out of my way.  I'm trying to turn here.  Where pedestrians cross into the crosswalk. 
[00:04:30]  When it says don't walk, I got a green light.  I'm going to run you over.  The good old days, you know.  Hopefully soon we'll be able to all rally together a mutual hatred for whoever the hell  is underneath our tons of bombs that we'll be dropping soon.  All right.  Neil, you're the first call on the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's going on?  Hey, guys.  How are you doing today?  Pretty good.  Hey, just one thing.  I'm just wondering where the hell is Sharpton all this, the supposed leader of the people?  I'm in an underground bunker.  No, seriously.  Seriously.  It's called the Big Dig in Boston. 
[00:05:00]  Why isn't he coming out in support of the cops for all the years that he rode them into  the ground over everything?  Why isn't he coming out?  You know, where is he?  I saw him on Sparta TV today.  I think.  He's bouncing off about something.  See, here's some of the great hatred that we all remember.  Well, there's no turmoil as far as Al Sharpton's concerned.  He knows.  Al makes his living between, you know, the strife between the blacks and the whites in this  city.  Yeah.  Let's be honest.  And, you know, you walk around the city now, people are, the blacks and the whites and 
[00:05:30]  everyone else, we're all one now, man.  I'm not, no one's, no one's thinking, you know, the difference between any, uh, any, uh,  any group these days in the city.  Except for the Arabs.  Well, yeah.  Everyone's been looking at them with a little suspicion.  I feel bad for the, uh, the, the, the innocent, uh, uh, the Arabs, but, you know.  I know.  But what do you, you know, what do you want from us at this point?  Don't you look, I mean.  Your own people are just living in this country in these little cells, you know, just waiting  for the word to do this, uh, this, uh, this type of thing. 
[00:06:00]  So we don't, we don't know where you, where, where you are or, you know, where you live  and, you know, sure.  We're going to give you a look when we see you now.  It's just natural.  I'm sorry to say it.  Hopefully finally the black community will realize the fraud that he is.  Well, I, I, we haven't seen him on the tube.  That's for sure.  He was on, he was on bet today.  I saw him on bet today during, during the, uh, during the ceremony, which I thought was  absolutely beautiful.  Yeah.  I finally have a lot of confidence in Bush.  Yeah.  After that speech that he made today.  Yeah. 
[00:06:30]  And finally a, a very good speech that showed nothing but steel.  Yeah.  He's ready to go.  My friends.  The speech in the cathedral was really good.  I believe the response that what's going to happen is just going to be bigger than anyone  thinks.  He's ready to go.  So, all right, guys.  Thanks.  And, and I, I think it starts tomorrow.  You think so?  Whatever.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  This isn't something that's like, okay, you know, they did this, we'll do this.  That's it.  We all know that, but, but it's time to make a statement and that statement I think will happen  either tomorrow or Sunday.  We'll, we'll see. 
[00:07:00]  We will see.  His speech from the cathedral in Washington today was a lot better than those little snippet  speeches he gave on Tuesday.  Had a little more emotion to it.  He was a little more clear about what, what he was saying.  But the Reverend Billy Graham's speech or sermon, how come it's called a sermon when  a priest does it?  Uh, or Reverend, he gets up there and I, I'm sorry, I can't relate to it.  He's talking about how, uh, the people that, um, died Tuesday are in heaven and they wouldn't 
[00:07:30]  want to come back because it's paradise there.  And he's going into this whole science fiction story of, of religion that I just, I can't  relate to.  I can't get comfort from it.  You know?  Hey, what if somebody was an evil person that died in there?  Uh, are they burning in hell right now?  You know, I, I can't buy the whole sci-fi thing.  And, and just, he's saying that we really, these people went to work and got on the plane 
[00:08:00]  and didn't know it was going to be their last day on earth, which is true.  But then he's using that to say, this is why we have to get closer to God.  And, you know, with, with, with the reason that these, uh, monsters did this being their  version of God and what their God wants them to do.  So I really don't want to hear the other end of the spectrum of what, uh, Billy Graham  wants us to do for our God.  You know, I'm pretty much, I've had it up to here with the religion, you know, let's 
[00:08:30]  get to the religion of, uh, the bomb and start just wreaking some havoc of our own.  You're ready to go.  My friend, the flaming finger of God, stirring it around like a, some warm coffee around  Afghanistan.  That's what I want to say.  Uh, Todd, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing guys?  Pretty good.  You know, from sitting here listening to you and, uh, my first feeling so far today has 
[00:09:00]  been anger and despair and each day I feel even more numb.  Yeah.  I'm just more pissed off and bummed and, and like, I'm, I'm tired of it.  I, I, of course, like anyone, I want it to just go away, but I know it's not gonna, but  I really don't even want to deal with it anymore.  I'll tell you though, being a true New Yorker, I was in that building the night before with some  friends and then it was too cloudy to take pictures and I said, Oh, we'll be able to  come back.  Yeah.  Which, which we can't.  But the more I hear about it, you know, that, uh, quiet anger that New Yorkers walk around  with, as you were saying before.  Yeah.  I think what's, what's really on the pulse of it now is that everybody is just wants 
[00:09:30]  to turn that anger into whomever our enemies decide to be.  And I think the waiting is just killing us.  Everyone's waiting.  The waiting's just about over, my friend.  It is.  Todd, hang in there.  Things are gonna be all right, man.  The flag still stands.  Thanks.  And on one funny note.  Yeah.  I was watching Tom Brokenjaw.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The only thing that makes me laugh is that guy's got no front teeth.  Those lips do not move.  And that speech impediment's great.  It's amazing. 
[00:10:00]  But, uh, God bless for the work you're doing.  And, uh, I hope everybody has, who passed away, I wish them well.  All right.  And, uh.  Thank you, Todd.  It was good.  Thank you.  Hang in there, all right?  Thank you.  I, I gotta tell you one thing.  And then tell me how you feel about this, Ant.  Um, when you get out of the, the, the subway near Penn Station, you, you, you, uh, down near  Penn Station, you walk about a block and a half in front of, uh, Macy's and all that.  There's a bunch of people set up, always selling stuff as you're going to the trains,  along the railroad and stuff.  Uh, usually it's a bunch of crap, you know, incense and, and, and, you know, little, little 
[00:10:30]  drawings and stuff.  You sit there and they draw your face, blah, blah, blah.  Right.  Yesterday, um, there were people selling the American flags.  Right.  Like crazy.  And then, um, there were some, uh, Orientals.  Asians, I should say.  They're Asian people, Opie.  Asians.  Asians.  That's a politically correct term to use.  Um, and they were selling pictures, Anthony.  They were selling pictures of the Twin Towers completely engulfed in flames. 
[00:11:00]  And people were buying them.  Why?  Why were they selling them?  Why were people buying them?  Well, I, I think they, they've, you know, saw an opportunity to make some money, you know?  It's something that's, that's America, that America's about.  And I'm sitting there going, you gotta be kidding me.  And why aren't the people, you know, on this sidewalk, you know, on this sidewalk,  walking by outrage, yelling, I saw something last night that freaked me out, too.  In a little, in a little, like, cardboard frame, you can get your, uh, your Twin Towers 
[00:11:30]  picture completely engulfed in flames.  Yeah, that's good.  Hand your cash over, uh, for that.  Bastards.  I saw something last night freaked me out.  Pretty much, uh, on the same lines.  A woman waiting on line with a bunch of other people with pictures of loved ones, uh, trying  to, uh, find out where they are and what happened to them.  She's standing there, tears in her eyes.  With the picture, wearing a shirt, a white shirt, with the World Trade Center on it,  and it says, Terror at the Towers. 
[00:12:00]  Oh.  She bought a fucking T-shirt.  She bought a T-shirt.  That says, Terror, she had to be walking down the, and I, I pictured this in my head.  She's got the picture of the person she loves.  That she's trying to find.  That she's trying to find that died in this mess.  Going from hospital to hospital.  And, and on her way there or somewhere, she stopped and saw T-shirts for sale.  Uh, totally using the dead and the tragedy to turn a buck with a T-shirt. 
[00:12:30]  She forked over her money and is wearing a Terror at the Towers T-shirt.  I couldn't, I couldn't believe it.  You guys, you gotta give those people hell.  You gotta, and I, I, you know, no violence, obviously.  No advocating violence here, but a stern friggin' tongue lashing.  You gotta give those people hell that are selling the, the T-shirts of the Towers engulfed.  And the pictures.  Or the little pictures on the corner.  You know, these Asian people barely spoke English.  You know, they're, they're here in America, you know. 
[00:13:00]  Sons of bitches.  Reaping the benefits.  And now they, they see an opportunity to, to, to sell pictures of, uh, the Twin Towers engulfed.  Something needs to be said of these people.  You know what you do?  And I'm pissed off at myself.  Yeah, it's because someone will call.  I did not say anything last night.  And the whole way home on the Long Island Railroad, I was like, why did not, why didn't I say anything?  About that?  Why am I, yeah, because it pissed me off.  You know what you do?  Uh, if you see an Asian person selling stuff like that, it's harmless.  It wouldn't hurt. 
[00:13:30]  It's like a nerf.  Throw an egg roll at them.  Buy an egg roll and throw it at them.  Bastards.  What the hell are they doing on the sidewalk selling pictures of the moment people are dying and making a buck from it?  See, I haven't seen the T-shirts yet.  I was stunned.  I was stunned.  You saw it, Kev?  Yeah, because, because Kev was looking over as I was saying this and going like, yeah, terror in the towers.  Yeah, I saw it on CNN.  Could you believe that this woman who's grieving and trying to find this person is supporting someone making money off of the death of those people? 
[00:14:00]  Why would you even make a T-shirt for this occasion?  Yeah, why would you make it?  And then if you're affected directly by it, why would you then buy it and support that F that's selling those shirts?  That's the strangest part about your little story.  She was walking the streets of Manhattan trying to find this person.  And she decides she's going to buy a T-shirt.  She needs the T-shirt.  Who made the T-shirts up? 
[00:14:30]  What company made it up?  What friggin' monster company made it up?  Yeah.  We just got to start taking some action here.  Piss me off.  All right.  Let's go to Philly.  Something.  Ah, man.  Phones aren't working.  Every day, every day, every day.  Same thing happens with the phones.  Do, do, do, do, do, do.  Which line?  Three.  Thank you.  Jeff, what's going on? 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  Can you hear me?  Yeah.  Guys, first of all, all of Philadelphia, you should see what's going on outside the station, YSP, the one that broadcasts you.  Yeah, I'm hearing there's like a thousand people outside the radio station right now bringing all sorts of stuff by.  There's at least 15 to 20 trucks on their way up.  They said they were going to stop at 5.  I think they're going well into the night.  They have to.  Cool.  Everything.  People coming out of the woodworks to donate stuff?  Yes, there are. 
[00:15:30]  I work at a hotel, and I'm getting any kind of towels that aren't being used right now.  They're coming up tomorrow.  Okay.  You guys can use that and soap and everything.  So, all around the country, go to your nearest Red Cross.  Now, I do want to say something about that woman who was selling the T-shirts.  I wasn't going to say it, but now you started me.  Yeah.  This woman, if she has the vendor's license, revoke it, throw her little ass in jail right now.  That is despicable.  And if she isn't, she should be arrested anyway for illegal selling. 
[00:16:00]  What are they screaming at out there?  I think they're playing foosball.  Oh, there you go.  Oh, they're playing foosball.  We're back to normal.  We're back to normal outside our studio.  Great.  There should be no one selling anything to do with this tragedy.  They shouldn't be allowed.  They shouldn't be allowed.  And the dopes that are buying this stuff and supporting these people should be smacked in the frigging face.  It's up to us to make it hard for them to sell this crap on the streets of New York. 
[00:16:30]  I'm telling you, guys.  Just bombard them with curses and don't stop until they fold up their little suitcase full of goodies and leave.  Because that's a disgrace.  We can hate your giants.  We can hate your jets.  We can hate your rangers up here.  Right now, we are one country together.  And there was a picture I just signed on to the computer and the picture of the American flag with all the rubble around it.  You can hurt our building. 
[00:17:00]  You cannot kill the spirit of America.  You guys are doing a hell of a job.  Which picture are you talking about?  The three firemen putting our American flag back up?  No, actually, it's one that's just a flag that was actually standing.  I have seen that other one, too.  Yeah, that's a great one.  It's the soldiers raising the flag at Iwo Jima.  Yeah.  And, you know, it's a famous shot.  You guys hang in there.  It is going to get better.  We will go back to lesbians for a day.  It's just going to take some time.  That's cool.  And we'll go back to hating your sports teams, my friend. 
[00:17:30]  Take care, guys.  That's what makes this radio show fun.  Trust me, all right?  Take care.  Hang in there, buddy.  I'm going to talk to someone from WYSP to see exactly what the details are down there, all right?  We'll help you out with that.  There goes Jeff.  Yeah, Anthony, why don't you explain that screensaver?  Because it's my screensaver, because I think it's awesome.  Yeah, somebody...  Usually, just to show you my frame of mind, by the way, my screensavers always revolve around some really hot-looking chick.  Yeah.  But, like, screw that for a while.  And someone sent me the picture, and it's my screensaver now. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, it's one shot is Iwo Jima, the soldiers raising the flag.  It's a famous shot, the statue of it.  And there's another shot right next to it of the firefighters raising a flag at the World Trade Center, three firefighters.  And the flag pole that they're raising it on is tilted on an angle just like the one at Iwo Jima.  And it looks very similar.  And the spirit of the two photos is quite similar, too.  Yeah, it moved me. 
[00:18:30]  I was like, yeah, this is what I want to see every day.  Eric from Jersey saying that T-shirt, Terror at the Towers, was from the car bombing years ago.  But, no, I saw other ones that were...  Well, this guy's saying the Terror at the Tower T-shirt was from the bombing in 93.  Yeah, the bombing in 93.  Well, whatever.  Why are you wearing any T-shirts about, you know, the World Trade Center being bombed or exploding?  I'm not apologizing.  Well, what?  They're dumping out.  What happened?  Bill from Stanford. 
[00:19:00]  Why?  I called him a rooster.  I'll have to do that.  Oh.  Hey, morons.  The Terror at the Tower T-shirt was from the 93 blast.  Please apologize.  I'm not apologizing.  It's the same thing.  It's the same thing.  This woman that's looking for her loved one is wearing a Terror at the Tower T-shirt.  I don't care where it's from.  And it didn't look like a T-shirt that was almost 10 years old either.  I have concert T-shirts from 10 years ago. 
[00:19:30]  I can't even see them anymore.  They're so full of holes.  So, I'm not apologizing, Bill.  Tool.  Tool.  God, I'm angry.  We've got to bomb something quick.  I can't take this much longer.  Let's get some phones going here.  Dave, what's going on, man?  Hey, guys.  I've been listening to you guys for a while since you started hearing photos, and I think  what you guys are doing are great.  Cool.  You know, I just got back to my office a little bit ago from being out on the road and been 
[00:20:00]  thinking about the people up there in New York and D.C. and all that.  And what these SOBs have done to us is terrible.  And what I was thinking about on the way back to my office today is that last weekend was  the Naval Air Show down here in Well Grove.  And to watch those planes fly by was awesome.  And now I'm thinking, you've got to think about the military people now, too.  And you know what these guys are going to be facing in the next week, days, whatever it 
[00:20:30]  may be.  Yeah, it's not going to be easy.  Try months, possibly years.  I know.  Our hearts need to be with them, too.  All right.  And, you know, I was driving down the road last time, and I was watching the F-117, and  I was telling my wife what a beautiful sight that was.  Yeah.  We've got some hardware.  Yeah.  We've got some hardware.  And we need to think about them, too.  All right, Dave.  Thank you.  Mm-hmm.  Bye. 
[00:21:00]  Bye.  Hang in there.  Big Rock has something different from Cleveland.  Big Rock, what's going on?  What's going on, fellas?  How are you, my friend?  Oh, I'm just fine, man.  I want to tell you guys that I'm with the Salvation Army, and we're getting our buses together  to come up to New York and help you guys out.  Cool.  And I just want to know, did you guys see SmackDown last night?  Did they really run SmackDown?  Man, Vince McMahon had a, I have a dream, man.  Vince McMahon had me pumped. 
[00:21:30]  Had me wanting to go over to Iraq with my damn self and kill some of them.  Is this true?  Is this true that Vince McMahon did a little speech last night?  He went, man.  I'm so, man, he went off.  We've got to find that somehow.  He was like, he was like, I want to see what Vince McMahon had to say.  We're going to fight.  We're not going to take this line down.  I was just like, let's do it.  I mean, I was like, President Vince, let's roll.  How can we get a copy of that?  How can we get a copy of that?  And I got to hear that.  Oh, man.  I don't think it was running the New York area.  Yeah, it probably wasn't.  No, because there was nothing else on TV last night. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  SmackDown did.  Come on.  It was on UPN, matter of fact.  Yeah.  Because they were in Austin Monday.  So because of what happened Tuesday, they had to stay, basically.  And Vince was just saying, you know, I feel for the people of New York, but, you know,  we have to show the world that we're not afraid of these terrorists.  Right.  You know, so that's what he did.  He ran SmackDown and everybody had, you know, their opinions of what to say, you know, and  it was very, it was very moving. 
[00:22:30]  That's so strange you're saying that about a Vince McMahon speech.  I know.  I'm just curious to hear it now.  Oh, man.  All right.  We're going to find it.  Thanks, bro.  It does make sense.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye.  Vince is really patriotic.  And, you know, he's a showman.  He knows how to give a good speech.  And he doesn't have to worry about saying the wrong thing like a politician would.  So I'm sure if he did give some kind of speech, it was full of, full of fire.  Right on.  Andy, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:23:00]  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, nice work you got going on here.  Cool.  Anyway, listen, I was thinking about all these, thanking all these people that are helping  out and whatnot.  I think we should add two more thankful groups to the list here.  I think we should add all these young kids that are signing up now to go over and do  this if we're going to do it.  Yep.  And also the vets.  Because I think that they made this country what it is today and made it as strong as it  is and gave us a reason to fight.  All right.  Cool, bro.  And one more thing real quick.  Yeah.  Looks like Condit got everything he wanted, you know? 
[00:23:30]  Oof.  Who's looking for Shondra Levy now?  Yeah.  How lucky did he get it?  Nobody cares about her at all.  Yeah.  Well.  So he lucked out.  All right, bro.  All right, bud.  Thanks, Andy.  Take it easy.  Anyone lucked out?  Um, we have the Vince McMahon thing, possibly?  Yeah.  How the hell we got that?  I'm trying to go to it.  Wow.  Is it A or B?  It's B, right?  No, it's A, right?  Rick, A, B, C, or D. It's not A, B, D, C, Rick.  It's neither one now. 
[00:24:00]  I know what it is.  You know what it is?  Ah, Ben knows what it is.  All right, Ben.  Vince McMahon giving a speech.  Is it going to be like the Gulf War days where the WWF has characters, the sheik type character,  and, you know, they'll have like an Afghani guy and a Bin Laden looking guy, and we could  beat them up in the ring and everyone will cheer from their trailers across the country.  Oh, Ben. 
[00:24:30]  That's not it either.  All right.  If you get it over here, you might be able to pop it up on mine.  It's on, um...  Well, don't give it out.  Yeah, don't give it out.  We want to check it out.  Just pop it on my site.  All right, we'll figure it out.  But, uh, let's move on with Rob.  Rob, what's up?  Hi.  Hey, Rob.  Am I on?  Yeah, you're on.  Oh, okay.  First off, I wanted to say, uh, I've been listening to this show since you guys came back here.  You guys are doing excellent.  I think that you guys are doing the best out of everybody.  You know, all the stations up here have already went back to their music, and you really can't 
[00:25:00]  get any information.  Yeah, I don't know the feel of the other cities, but, uh, you know, I'm still pissed  off that, uh, all the stations in New York are back to regular programming myself, but...  I am so...  But I'm just one guy.  Yeah, I'm so utterly pissed off.  I'm just a wacky, wacky, goofy radio guy, so what do I know?  I am, I am so pissed off.  It's...  Uh, Ben, I'm talking to Rob from Boston.  Hold on a second.  So, we got the, uh, Ben.  All right, well, God damn it.  All right, I just wanted to say, um...  I have no patience left for anyone.  Real quickly. 
[00:25:30]  I hate everybody.  One of my teachers...  Well, we had to see if it was working.  The only way to do it is to play it.  All right, but Rob has something to say in Boston.  Go ahead, Rob.  Okay, yeah, I was in class yesterday, and one of my teachers decided to make some comments  about this whole situation.  Yeah.  You know, we're all sitting there learning in our math class, and the teacher decided  to say, oh, you know, I guess a couple kids came late because they must have missed  their, uh, their flight.  Yeah.  Hello?  Hello?  Uh, thank you, Rob. 
[00:26:00]  All right.  Hey, Rob, thanks.  Oh, are you guys leaving?  What?  I'm here.  What?  Never mind.  All right, listen.  Let's...  We got to regroup because...  All right.  Do we have that clip now?  Yes.  All right.  It's okay.  Take a breath, everyone.  All right.  Okay.  Start it up.  Here we go.  We're buffering, as they say in the, um, internet business.  Buffering.  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Houston, Texas for a very special live edition  of World Wrestling Federation Smackdown. 
[00:26:30]  Where's my chick, J.R.?  U.S.  Why am I here?  U.S.  U.S.  U.S.  U.S.  U.S.  U.S.  U.S.  U.S.  U.S.  Tonight, the spirit of America lives here in Houston, Texas.  On behalf of everyone here in the arena and a worldwide television audience, we would like 
[00:27:00]  to extend our condolences to the victims and the families and friends of the victims of  the terrorist acts that occurred on Tuesday in New York City and Washington, D.C.  Our nation's leaders have encouraged us to return to living our lives the way we normally 
[00:27:30]  do.  Our nation's leaders have encouraged us to continue to live our lives the American way.  They've encouraged us to practice.  Buffering, Opie.  Buffering.  It happens.  You know, it's the internet.  And I guess what Vince is going to say is that's why he's having Smackdown, because he wants 
[00:28:00]  to continue.  You know, if a man could fall out of the rafters and die and they could keep the pay-per-view  going, this should be nothing for Vince McMahon.  Why don't we get it on Shortcut so we don't have to, like, go through all this and then  we can play.  That might help.  Yeah, I was in the process of doing that.  Yeah, right.  What's the matter, Opie?  Calm down.  No.  It's okay.  No.  You're freaking out.  You didn't get to see Christy Turlington today.  That's okay. 
[00:28:30]  Go F yourself.  Go F yourself.  I'm ripping off Earl.  Psycho Mark, what's up?  F-15s are flying over the hood, yo.  They ain't taking us again, man.  No.  Air Force One's coming in, so you're going to see a lot of action.  They just blew by full afterburners.  There's nothing seen better than American fighters.  Yeah.  Full things coming out those missiles are on the way. 
[00:29:00]  All right.  They're flying overhead downtown there.  They're circling around.  The president's going to be here shortly.  We're all being set up.  They've locked everything down.  The service is all over the place.  It's a real tight situation.  And, again, thanks to everybody out there who sent stuff in.  My God, this stuff flies.  It's just amazing.  I mean, they just keep coming in.  People keep walking in with stuff.  God bless everybody.  Yeah.  It's amazing. 
[00:29:30]  You know, just the sport.  My hood's destroyed, yo.  It's just not a good thing.  My hood's destroyed, yo.  It is, yo.  Yo, B.  Why are you saying yo a lot?  I just want you to smoke 12 joints.  What would you say?  Yeah.  You're having slept in days.  You're smoking dope.  Dude, I'm out of my mind.  They just put me up at a Tribeca Grand so I can pull a Mariah Carey tonight.  Oh, so you can just go insane?  Well, I won't go insane.  I'll just, you know, throw the furniture out the window and TV like my father used to do. 
[00:30:00]  You're not allowed in your place anymore?  No, I won't.  It's not so much that I'm allowed in.  The guys will let me in.  But I live on the 43rd floor.  So would you like to walk up in a day?  No.  I didn't think so.  So now Fox put me up.  They were real, you know, they were great.  Thank God for Fox.  Fox.  But we're just trying to establish.  There goes an F-15 again.  Yeah, America. 
[00:30:30]  You guys can hear it.  Here we go.  Cool.  That's something else.  Jesus.  F-15, full afterburn of the effort.  We're coming after you, sons of bitches.  And you better watch out.  All right.  I wonder where Air Force One's going to land today.  They're not going to.  They're going to bring him in by chopper.  Most likely.  Yeah, that's obvious.  But they're going to.  If anything, they landed at McGuire Air Force Base, probably down in New Jersey or out of Long Island.  But most likely McGuire. 
[00:31:00]  And they'd fly him up, you know, in the chopper.  Yeah.  Either that or they'd go directly chopper.  But they got this whole place grounded down, man.  It's insane.  Yeah, I don't think they'll fly him into Kennedy or anything.  Well, they might.  You know, everything's shut down.  You know, you never know.  Yeah.  All right.  That's true.  All right, Mark.  Call back if anything else is happening down there.  All right.  I'll call in after President Kimmel.  Again, just a tremendous thanks to everybody out there who has picked up a bottle of Gatorade.  Hey, Mark, let me ask you a question.  Wait a minute.  Psycho Mark, Psycho Tim, your brother's on the phone. 
[00:31:30]  Hey, Timmy, you scumbag.  And Bob, what do you know?  With all the police presence and all the FBI, are they doing random drug searches on people walking down the street?  Dude, drug dealers are having a heyday in New York City.  I mean, they must be having cocaine parties up in the Bronx like to read about, you know?  I hate to say that.  It's a little disrespectful.  But with so much police presence down here, I'm sure there's a little other things being neglected.  Yeah.  Oh, here comes the president's helicopter now.  All right, guys.  Well, I'm going to run up to the rooftop and get a better view. 
[00:32:00]  I'll call you back with some more information as soon as it lands here.  I can see everything going on, all right?  Yeah, that must have been why you just heard those fighters because his helicopter just landed.  Where is that?  Any idea?  I think he's going to be landing at Sturman High School, which is right on the river.  They've got a whole park that's set off.  Oh, all right.  We're going to fade up the TV.  Thanks, guys.  He just touched down.  Hey, see you guys later.  Maybe also he'll be able to extend condolences and extend hope to those who are still wanting and hoping for good news from the crash site. 
[00:32:30]  As you might imagine, and we've been saying this really for more than 24 hours, his itinerary is secret.  We do know that the primary plan here is for him to actually meet people on the ground, express his grief, his sorrow, to show some compassion.  As Marsha Kramer, a reporter, mentioned just a few minutes ago, to roll up his sleeves and get involved with the folks who are involved both in the rescue effort and those grieving for the loved one's loss.  And he'll also be surrounded by the clergy of all different backgrounds. 
[00:33:00]  Is that what you're thinking, Ben?  To show again what this is about.  He's right by Battery Park.  I can totally tell by the area from the shot.  Huh.  Other aircraft circling around, too, making sure he's okay.  That is one secure area down there, man.  All right, let's go back to the phones.  Talk to John from Dallas.  John, what's up?  Hey, Nana.  How's everything going up there?  We're hanging in there, John.  Yeah, cool.  Hey, I just want you to know, even though we're way up there, just holler at her if we're right next door. 
[00:33:30]  And we've got some stuff and people coming up there.  And money will be trickling up there pretty soon.  But all you got to do is holler.  We're on the way.  Yeah, it's so cool how everyone is coming together on this thing.  So thanks, John.  You betcha.  Have a good one.  All right, bro.  Let's move on to Brad.  Brad, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, I just wanted to agree with that John guy there, man.  Like, everything that's going on around here now, like all these flags flying, half-staffed and everything, 
[00:34:00]  and everybody's sending materials out there that they need.  It's really boosting everybody's morale, I believe.  I think it's really a great thing.  Yeah, it's definitely.  We had a station up here, one of the rock stations I listened to up here in Cleveland.  They had a contest going on, a nationwide contest.  A grand prize was like $100,000.  And they decided to cancel the contest and send it up there to them guys and give them the money so they could help them out at all. 
[00:34:30]  Well, right on.  That's the thing to do.  All right.  Listen, I've got to go back because Psycho Mark is calling in again.  He might have a date.  All right.  Take it easy, guys.  All right, Brad from Cleveland.  Psycho Mark.  Dude, the president of the United States of America is directly over my head.  F-15s are circling around.  We've got CH-47s off in the distance.  We've got Apaches.  We've got everything, dude.  They've got F-15s circling.  It's an effing air show above Manhattan right now. 
[00:35:00]  Dude, it's an air show over Manhattan.  But this isn't any regular air show.  That doesn't get you psyched up a bit.  Oh, man.  There is some action right above our heads right now.  Dude, the president's circling right now.  He's right over the river.  Well, they've got two separate choppers for the president.  We're not sure which one's for the president.  One's going over Brooklyn right now, and one's right over the river.  They always have two.  They've got the decoy.  Yes, the decoy.  But then again, if you have two stinger missiles, hey, you take them both out.  Well, there's Hillary Rotten Clinton. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, did you see that miserable snot on TV?  And her wife, Chuck Schumer, who's always with us.  It seems like those two are attached at the frigging hip.  Everywhere you see Hillary, you see Chuck Schumer, Hillary's wife.  And boy, do those two look like leaders, huh, Anthony?  Hey, Anthony.  They really know how to lead and get us through a tough situation.  Hey, Anthony.  What's up, Mark?  You'll appreciate this.  I went up to David Blumenthal of NBC Nightly News.  I go, Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News. 
[00:36:00]  Could you pull your pants down to give me a gack, gack, gack?  He died.  I go, hey, David, give us an opium, Anthony.  He's like, no, I've never heard of him.  I go, well, they do a good Tom Brokaw.  You should tune in, you dumbass.  And this is the same psycho, Mark, that was the respected journalist that Fox was using  as their man on the scene on Tuesday.  Wow, come on.  I almost beat up some ABC producer, some slant-eyed bitch.  She comes up here, right, with a bunch of waters, right?  She goes, I've got water for everybody. 
[00:36:30]  And she looks at me with a box hat.  She goes, oh, you work for Fox.  I'm like, F you, you miserable bitch.  We're all in this together.  So she's thinking of the water?  F you, you miserable bitch.  We're all in this together.  The only psycho, Mark, could say something like that and have it make any sense.  Can we quote you on that, Mark?  Dude, any day.  All right.  F you, you good.  No, but I mean, there's nothing worse than women producers and TV.  I'm sorry.  This is all the tech guys out there that have to put up with those stupid bags.  We've had an experience with a couple of women producers. 
[00:37:00]  Dude, there are much.  I think they break them all from the same mold.  I think they know how to drink.  Yeah, right.  That's for sure.  So the president right now, both the choppers are out of sight.  I think they're landing at the heliport, which is on the...  Well, one landed already.  Yeah, they're on the East.  In Battery Park.  Yeah, exactly.  By the East River.  They just landed by the East River.  What on the East River?  What battery part?  The heliport, that would be most likely by the Brooklyn Bridge.  All right.  The closest one.  But I just want to let you guys know that...  Wait, Ben is there. 
[00:37:30]  No, Ben.  What do you got?  The Statue of Liberty is on the side that the one they're showing on Channel 2 right now.  So that would be right over by Battery Park, as opposed to being over by South Street Seaport.  Something landed on the west side, because you could see the Statue of Liberty.  All right, Mark.  All right, guys.  Call us back if anything else is going on, all right?  Yeah, no worries.  All right, man.  Take care, bros.  There.  Mark, thank God the pot is still getting into our country.  And for the likes of people like Psycho, Mark.  Keep the cop.  What's going on?  What's going on, fellas? 
[00:38:00]  Hey, how are you holding up, man?  I just woke up.  Dude, you scared the hell out of me last night.  Dude, let me tell you something.  And then I tried to call you back, and I couldn't get your phone to work.  Let me tell you, Hope.  Yeah.  That's scary enough, man.  You know, I wish I hit record on my phone.  I didn't even tell Anthony.  Keith, can I...  Yeah, what the hell.  You know, Keith's been calling a bunch of us at night when he's at Ground Zero to just kind of give us the feel of what's going on down there as they continue their rescue efforts and all that.  And so we hang up, you know, after Keith's like, man, he's really effed up down here and, you know, really somber and real serious and stuff. 
[00:38:30]  But mellow, you know, and he's like, yeah, we're just kind of waiting around, waiting to, you know, do something.  And then I hang up.  Ten minutes later, I answer the phone, and it's Keith the cop, like I've never heard him before, scared out of his effing mind.  You were running, right?  As fast as I could.  Full sprint, full sprint, and this is all that goes to me.  He goes, dude, turn on your TV and tell me which building is collapsing. 
[00:39:00]  Whoa.  Because what, a siren went off, which basically says, you know, get the hell out of the area?  Yeah, they're telling you, like, you know, you hear the sirens or, you know, you hear collapse, and then everyone just starts running.  And it's just total chaos, running in every direction, just trying to get away.  And you don't know what it is.  They don't say, okay, run this way, because this building's going, they just say, run, run.  So it's a coincidence, because you hit redial or something, right?  I hit redial on the phone.  And all I hear is, like, turn on the TV, tell me what building's falling. 
[00:39:30]  Freaking the F out.  And you can just imagine, because when you get out of the Ground Zero area, because they have that area lit up like it's day, right?  Right, kid?  Yeah.  But as soon as you get kind of on the outskirts of the lights, it's a go-town.  Total darkness.  No one on the streets.  And he's just running for his life, has no clue if a building's coming down around him.  Oh, man.  And, you know, you freaked me out.  And then we, you know, you thought you were okay, and you hung up.  And then I'm like, man, I've got to call him back. 
[00:40:00]  And I couldn't get through to your phone for whatever reason.  Yeah, the cell phone, you know, there's still in and out down there.  Yeah.  So it's just like, you know.  That was freaky last night.  I know.  And then, you know, you go back.  A full sprint, trying to make a call, scared, going, turn on the TV, turn on the TV, tell me which building is falling.  Yeah, and you go back, and 10 minutes later, you know, 20 minutes later, you're back on the pile, and you're working again.  And, you know, 20 minutes later, it happens again.  Right.  And, you know, then you just start to freak out a little bit when you're standing on the pile. 
[00:40:30]  And, you know, now things start, you know, guys are working, and then all of a sudden you feel like a rumble.  Yeah.  Or, you know, you get scared.  But, I mean, you get through it, you know, and you do what you got to do.  But that night was just, you know.  Yeah, it was wild, dude.  What's going on today?  Well, you just woke up.  Yeah, I mean, I started yesterday at 4 p.m.  I got off this morning at 10 o'clock.  Uh-huh.  I slept for a couple hours here. 
[00:41:00]  Uh-huh.  And I'm going 4 o'clock back on the clock, and I'm going to head back down again.  Right.  And, you know, I mean, I have no idea what went on for the last six hours because I've just, you know, been asleep.  Right.  But I'm going to, you know, head back down again.  All right, Keith.  All right.  Nothing really happened last night?  Uh, no.  You know, the one thing is, like, you know, after you do have those incidents where you're, you know, you're scared and you're running like that and stuff,  and you get back on the pile, and last night when, you know, they call for a back door, and they bring it up to the top of the hill, 
[00:41:30]  and, you know, they pull a fireman, and, I mean, it's all worth it.  Yeah.  You know, the feeling that you get, and everyone stops working for, you know, a couple minutes,  and they start cheering as they take the guy out.  Uh-huh.  I mean, it makes the risk of what you're doing all worth it to see, you know, one of our own get pulled out again.  Yeah.  All right.  So.  All right, Keith.  I'll talk to you guys soon.  Hang in there.  Okay, thanks.  Yeah.  Bye.  That was crazy last night.  I wish I had the audio of that.  It was insane. 
[00:42:00]  Let's move on to Carl.  Hey, Carl.  Hey, how are you doing?  Pretty good.  Am I on?  Yeah, let's go.  Oh, no kidding.  All right.  I'm calling from Boston.  First of all, great job, you guys.  I know everybody's been telling you that.  I wanted to mention a little bit about some of the coverage that people like CNN have been doing,  reporting false information.  It gets a little frustrated.  You don't know what to believe.  Yeah, you're so right.  You're so right.  For example, you know, pulling the firefighters out of an SUV yesterday, come to find out that wasn't true.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:42:30]  And then also, you know, these 10 people we arrested down in New York.  Mm-hmm.  It turns out it wasn't even related.  Yeah.  To all this stuff.  You know, what do you guys think about this?  Well, we discussed this yesterday.  What's going on is, you know, they're looking for ratings.  They're looking for, you know, people to watch their particular broadcast of this whole thing.  And they're all trying to scoop each other.  Yeah.  You know, that's what it has become.  It's a news event, and they want to have better coverage than all the other stations doing it. 
[00:43:00]  They blurt it out, hope it ends up true.  You're right.  I think they ought to have a little more respect for the American public.  You know, forget about ratings for a while.  It's a national crisis.  Right.  So, you know, put that stuff aside and just report the facts.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Well, you're not going to see that.  Nope.  You know, I mean, they definitely want to get as much ratings out of this as possible.  But, you know something?  The American people eat this up.  They eat this crap up.  They do.  You couldn't go anywhere without everybody talking about every report. 
[00:43:30]  And everyone tries to one-up each other on what they know about and how accurate their report is.  So, not that anyone's enjoying it.  I'm not saying that.  Don't get me wrong.  I'm just saying that we eat this stuff up.  And it's just our nature, I guess.  So, there's a demand.  So, they're just supplying it.  You're absolutely right.  Hey, you know, just one more thing.  I think you guys were talking a little bit at the top of your show about how things have been a little quiet. 
[00:44:00]  Nothing new was really developed.  I think it's the calm before the storm.  You know what I mean?  Oh, there's no doubt in my mind.  I understand what's going on.  Today's a day to mourn and tomorrow we get down to business.  Right.  Whether it's tomorrow or something.  I can't imagine we have nothing huge to report by Monday.  You have not seen the generals.  You haven't seen the people that plan these things out.  They haven't been holding the press conferences.  They are waiting and planning. 
[00:44:30]  And that's what's going on right now.  We are mother as we speak.  We are mother efforts when it comes to this thing.  The thing we were talking about yesterday, Dick Cheney.  Where the hell has Dick Cheney been?  President Bush is at the churches.  He's there.  Now he's in New York.  He's at the hospitals down there in Washington.  In Washington.  He's in New York meeting with the people at Ground Zero that are doing the rescue efforts and recovery.  Why don't you think he isn't in Washington planning the attack? 
[00:45:00]  Because he's being kept briefed on what they're doing.  But there are people that are doing that.  Dick Cheney.  Goddamn, our president is in New York City.  There he goes.  Pretty cool, huh?  Did he land yet?  Yeah.  Yeah, he just walked out.  Oh, man.  You know who's going to...  I'm getting pumped.  I'm getting pumped.  You know who this is really going to affect?  The airlines.  Bad.  I was listening to wins. 
[00:45:30]  And the guy says, if you want some kind of perspective on how bad the airlines are going to be hit by this,  they still have to pay their employees.  They still have to maintain the aircraft, which costs a lot of money every day.  And without money coming in, they're going to go broke real quick.  He put some perspective on it.  He goes, ask yourself if you're going to fly in the near future.  Then ask 10 of your friends if they're going to fly and listen to the answer.  And you decide what kind of an impact that's going to have on air travel and the airline industry. 
[00:46:00]  I can tell you by myself.  In, I think it's three weeks, I was going to fly to Rochester to check out the jets and the bills going at it.  I have no desire to go now.  Nope.  No desire whatsoever.  See, I think the government's going to have to step in.  This is going to cost more money than you could ever, ever imagine.  Not just directly with the damage and the compensation, but just the residual stuff like this, like the airlines.  The government's going to have to come in because we need a national airline.  We need these planes to be available. 
[00:46:30]  And in order to keep it going, the government's going to have to step in with billions of dollars.  So this is going to be really, really expensive in a lot of ways.  All right.  Let's talk to Tim Sabian, the program director of WYSP in Philadelphia, that has picked up our radio show.  Yeah, yeah.  Tim.  Hey.  How are you guys doing?  We got you on the air, man.  Hey, how are you doing?  Hey, I want to thank you for not breaking away from our show to play commercials.  Some of these cities have decided to do that today. 
[00:47:00]  It's just the right thing to do.  People need to hear what's going on in the vibe of what's happening.  And, you know, there's just a time to get involved and to, you know, make things right.  Right.  Cool.  I think Monday we'll probably get back to business as usual here at the station.  By the way, you guys can pot up Melissa.  She's here live on Fist and Market here in Philadelphia.  Okay.  We've got Operation Brotherly Love going on, and she can tell you all about it.  All right, now, Melissa. 
[00:47:30]  Melissa.  You guys got it?  No, we can't hear her.  You can't hear her?  We can't hear her, Tim.  Melissa.  Hello?  Hello?  Melissa.  Okay.  Well, thanks for that report, Melissa.  Hey, hold on a second.  Hang on.  All right.  All right.  That was too much technology.  Now I'm on the cell phone.  There you go.  You know, I got, Tim called me, and he wants, you know, he wants to talk about what's going  on in Philly, which is cool.  And he's like, why don't we do it to the ISDN line and this and that so it sounds clear. 
[00:48:00]  Like, no, the phone works good enough.  Let's just get the info out there and do this.  We don't have to be a slick radio show today.  Well, I was on the mic, but we're on the cell phone now, and I'm here to tell you guys  what's going on down here because it's absolutely amazing.  All right.  Unbelievable.  I wish that you guys could be here just to be a part of it.  I know you're in the city where everything's happening, but we wanted to let people know  that stuff is going on down here.  Melissa, you finally decided to flash everyone?  Yeah, right.  That's why all these people showed up. 
[00:48:30]  Well, fortunately, they're actually here for an amazing thing.  And the whole city united, there's people of all different races here and cultures, and  I swear to God, there's got to be a thousand people here right now and thousands throughout  the entire day that just brought supplies.  They donated trucks, and we're sending up a convoy.  It's Operation Brotherly Love, and we're going to be here until 5.  If I could just say a few things that we still need, empty boxes to come down here just 
[00:49:00]  to fill up all the stuff that these people so generously brought down.  But it's really touching.  I kind of lost it a few times today already, and usually these people see me out in the  public having a blast with them.  And then so many people came up to me today and just said, it's amazing to see you out  here directing traffic and hauling boxes.  And you know, you just have to get in there and do what you can.  If people are heading your way with stuff, the NYPD and the NYFD, they've given us a 
[00:49:30]  list that we need to pass along to everybody.  All right, I'll let them know.  No, these are the items that they really, really are looking for.  Eye wash, very, very important.  I saw a lot of that, so that's great.  Okay, surgical masks.  Yep.  Nasal spray.  Sterile water.  Soap.  Believe it or not, underwear, T-shirts, socks, gloves, knee pads, shampoo, five-gallon  buckets, hammers, picks, shovels.  Hammers. 
[00:50:00]  Protein bars.  Hmm.  Well.  Sports drinks, dog food for all the dogs down there, and boots oversized hair.  And they will not be accepting any money.  Do not bring money.  Do not send money.  They don't need that.  Okay.  Well, we pretty much satisfy all of that, so it's amazing.  I feel really good about it.  We have chucks coming down with all that stuff in it.  All right, cool.  Yeah, amazing.  And if I could just say one last thing before I let you guys go.  So just a really poignant moment that happened throughout the day here today. 
[00:50:30]  A whole entire truck full of Arab Americans showed up.  They were in their garb with their turbans on, big beards, and nobody really knew what  to think.  They opened their truck up.  They had tons of supplies for us.  They said they were here to help.  Everybody gave them a round of applause, and just they got tears in their eyes.  It was a really moving moment, and then some jerk in the crowd wept out and punched the  guy in the face.  Holy Jesus.  And the cops had to come and detain him. 
[00:51:00]  We just wanted to let everybody know that it was the most moving thing that's happened  in our city to be a part of this since it all happened to show all this solidarity and  have all these people come together.  And somebody had to ruin it, and we do not want to see that again anywhere in the entire  country.  I was personally very, very emotional about it, and this is hard enough, and we just  don't need that to be happening.  So you guys are providing some entertainment for us, getting a lot of information out there.  It sounded absolutely amazing, and I'm really proud of you guys. 
[00:51:30]  A lot of people came up to me to let me know to thank you guys for them.  And so I just want to let you know you sound amazing, and I'm proud of you guys.  Hopefully next week or a week after, whenever we really get back to normal, we can make  people forget about this week.  And remember that we are truly just a couple of ass-wives on the radio.  They're waiting to hear you guys be goosebumps again.  Well, we're going to come down there soon enough, so thank you, Melissa.  All right, can't wait to see you guys.  I'll see you soon.  Thank you so much.  We greatly appreciate that.  All right, bye-bye. 
[00:52:00]  Thanks for the nice words, too.  Is that just too effing much?  I mean, you could just...  That was such a feel-good story, and I'm like, wow.  And I was getting a little emotional, and then, come on.  It's like, oh, you know, you could just imagine them all getting together and going, look, let's  do this.  Let's make an effort to go down there and show that...  It took balls for them to make that type of an effort.  I could just picture some drunk guy.  Hey, Amber, we got to kick your ass.  Yes.  Or someone like Psychomark.  Take your stuff back, whap. 
[00:52:30]  Unbelievable.  That's just like a real touching moment just turned to crap.  Oh, people.  By the way, I personally want to thank everyone that has written the radio show.  There's no way.  There's just no way we're going to be able to write everyone back.  So I just want to let you know, we're reading every single email that you guys send in,  and thank you.  It means a lot, okay?  But as far as responses, because I know how it is.  You don't get a response.  Oh, they didn't even read it. 
[00:53:00]  Why bother?  We read every single one of them.  So thank you for that, okay?  Anthony, as we move on, our buddy Pete Radovich is checking in.  Pete?  Hey, guys.  How you doing, man?  From CBS Sports.  I can't believe Opie just said knee pads without giggling.  Yeah, I know.  See?  Well, we'll get back to giggling about things like knee pads soon.  Hey, listen, I'm starting to get upset here myself.  I mean, days have passed now, and there are a few things that I've noticed that have just  really pissed me off.  And I'll tell you a couple of them. 
[00:53:30]  One thing, last night I heard a report on the news where they were talking about the casualties  on one of the planes, and they said 64 were dead, including the hijackers.  It's not what I want to hear.  I want to hear 60 innocent human beings that were killed along with four filthy animals.  Right.  I don't want to hear any of these death tolls include the hijackers in them.  Yeah.  I was a little upset by that.  Another thing, I've already run into a couple people who are really just, you know, everyone's 
[00:54:00]  going to put themselves in this tragedy now.  And, you know, oh, I was supposed to be there.  I was supposed to be getting my hair done at that time.  Yeah.  And I'm so lucky.  Listen, just keep your phony stories to yourself.  Nobody cares.  There are thousands of families.  If you want to understand how many 5,000 families were affected, drive through your neighborhood  street by street and start counting houses, and when you get to 5,000, take a look at  how far you've gotten.  That's how many families were affected.  So nobody cares about your phony stories. 
[00:54:30]  We're going to find out in a month.  All of New York was supposed to be at the World Trade Center at 9 o'clock on Tuesday morning.  Right.  You know, that's a great point.  You hit that one on the head.  I am really tired of people saying they got up late or this or, you know.  Everyone was supposed to be there.  I mean, nobody cares.  Man, Pete, you just, wow.  Keep it to yourself.  Bravo, because, you know what?  I've heard a bunch myself.  Yep.  That's another thing that's really, and another thing I'm outraged by is that someone had  to call to knock over Anthony's football table on Monday.  Yeah, I know. 
[00:55:00]  I think that started it off.  We should have known that's something horrible.  Yeah, I've been keeping that one in myself for a while.  But the one I really call in about is the news reporting.  You know, I work in sports, and I've been to a million seminars before, you know, the NBA  season, NFL season, the Olympics.  And the one thing that the executive producer at NBC Sports always tells the announcers is  and hits it home a million times so they don't forget is when an injury happens, don't speculate. 
[00:55:30]  It's not fair to the fans.  It's not fair to the athletes.  And you don't want to look like an idiot.  You want to say, oh, I think he pulled his hamstring, and then a half hour later we find  out he broke a rib.  Right.  Don't speculate.  I mean, this is, we're talking about sports.  Yeah.  I mean, it doesn't even matter.  I mean, we're counting who puts the ball in the round rim more time.  I mean, but these, I think the news reporters, I thought it was going to change after the  elections because they were talking about, you know, we have to look at ourselves and  we're just, you know, this has got to change. 
[00:56:00]  We've got to be more responsible.  It's a mess because they were giving away results before they even came in.  Right.  Imagine you being in sports now.  Imagine the announcers giving the scores out before they even happen.  Right.  Exactly.  You know, I think this game's going to end with a score of 14-21.  Right.  And I just, and Anthony, you're right about the Emmys.  There are Emmys for best news coverage in a breaking story, best journalism in a breaking  story.  I mean, I think that's part of it.  And also when a story happens and a network reports it, what happens is, let's say, network 
[00:56:30]  XYZ reports a story.  All the other networks start the story by saying XYZ is just reported.  Right.  So what do you do?  You turn, you tune into XYZ.  Uh-huh.  So that's why part of it is a race so that everyone comes to them.  But I just think it's a little disturbing because, and even Giuliani addressed it this morning  that opened his press conference by asking the news agencies to really just kind of hold 
[00:57:00]  back.  Because the thing with the firefighters was really disturbing yesterday, I thought.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Out of all the tragedy, you get this little glimmer of good news.  And then it turns out to just be overzealous news reporting.  Then they had another story late last night about 10 police officers, some Port Authority  and New York City cops.  And, you know, they were digging like crazy, supposedly, you know, because they heard a  noise or a cell phone call or whatever it was.  Somebody contacted someone on a cell phone. 
[00:57:30]  Right, right, right.  Said one cop plus nine others were stuck in a tunnel or something.  And then I gave up because I waited about two hours because I'm like, oh, wow, this is huge,  you know.  And then I woke up this morning.  First thing I did was turn on the TV to see if they finally dug them out.  And, oh, oh, oh, we made a mistake with that.  Oops, there was nothing going on.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  When the attack first happened, I heard about four more planes that were still unaccounted  for.  Everyone was reporting it.  And then they just dropped it.  Yeah.  I kept on tuning in to see what happened with those four planes. 
[00:58:00]  And then they just never mentioned it again.  Yeah.  Well, the president is making his way to ground zero.  And that is one hell of a sight, man.  Oh, is he?  I've never seen so many black cars in my life.  Yeah, they got the big Suburbans and stuff.  Yeah.  The same vehicles the hip-hop guys like.  Isn't that amazing?  I want to call like the president.  You hanging in there, though, P?  Yeah, I'm doing all right.  I mean, I wish I were working.  Unfortunately, I had the weekend off.  So, fortunately, though, next week, I was going to tell Opie. 
[00:58:30]  I know you're a Jets fan.  I am doing a New England game, so I'm lucky in that I don't have to fly next weekend.  Yeah.  New England Jets, let me know.  Give me a call if you're interested in coming up for Sunday or the weekend.  You already know the answer, so.  What's that?  You know the answer already.  Oh, you want to come up?  Yeah, I would love to.  Yeah, come on.  I mean, we're doing a game on Sunday.  It's Jets at New England, so it's driving distance, and it should be a decent game.  So, we'll talk.  Give me a call. 
[00:59:00]  I'll give you a call.  I don't feel like flying anytime soon, but I still feel confident about driving.  Yeah, it'll be, you know, it'll be fun.  They haven't taken that away from me yet.  Exactly.  I wonder how they could do that.  So, but, guys, keep it up, and I just wanted to call in with a couple of things that have  really been bothering me, so.  Yeah.  And there you have it.  So, continue, and I'll be listening, and we'll talk Monday or Tuesday, I hope, about next  weekend.  All right, Pete.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  You're good.  Bye.  How about this?  Jerry Falwell's comments. 
[00:59:30]  Did you hear some of this stuff?  I read a lot of it today.  Jerry Falwell said late Thursday he didn't mean to blame feminist gays or lesbians for  bringing on the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington this week.  Here's some of his statement.  I really believe that the pagans and the abortionists and the feminists and the gays and the lesbians  who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, the People for the American  Way, all of them who have tried to secularize America, I point the finger in your face. 
[01:00:00]  And say, you helped this happen.  Oh, my God.  He sounds just as loony as the religious fanatics that are the terrorists.  They're failure.  That is just as loony trying to rally the troops of your religion to hate and blame. 
[01:00:30]  I'm so disgusted.  I got a religion.  Beer.  Uncle John, what's going on?  How you doing?  All right, Uncle John.  Hey, how about we put something together for the weekend and mobilize the O&A Army and let's  get together a collection effort.  If you want, I'll be happy to get involved.  I'll get some people together.  We've already started talking off the air.  We're trying to figure out what we can do.  We just wanted to do it in a way that, you know what I mean?  We just don't know what it is yet. 
[01:01:00]  We just don't know.  We don't know if we should do the supply thing.  I mean, maybe someone could help us out with that because, yeah, we reach a lot of people  and, yeah, we do come together, whether it's, you know, at a road show to have a stupid  time or when we have to get serious.  I think what we're doing is right now we're waiting too long, guys.  We're going to do it.  We've got to do it now.  Yeah, but I think a lot of things are in place already to donate.  You know what I mean?  I think it only, it might actually screw things up to start adding more different places and 
[01:01:30]  organizations to get things to.  You know, there are plenty of places.  You could just go out and donate stuff.  Well, that's the case.  Let's put out the word to our guys then.  Let's put out the word to the people that listen to the show.  Anybody that's ever laughed at you guys or cursed you guys or whatever, you know, O30,  go out and get your boys to go steal some socks, man.  Let's get going and get, you know, get something together from the O&A show.  Yeah, I think what we want to try to focus on is something for the victims.  That's even better. 
[01:02:00]  I think that's the way we're going because it just seems like everyone else is coming  together, you know, making sure they get the supplies and the men and everything.  And they need that, you know, right now.  And it seems like, you know, keep doing what you're doing, but it seems like there are so  many people, you know, taking care of that part of it right now.  So, and I think we could move on and do something, you know, for the victims when the time is  right.  It's just, you know, I'd say it's too early to think like that right now.  Right now, we...  By the way, John, your phone cracked out. 
[01:02:30]  We didn't hang up on you.  There are lists all over the place on websites and whatnot that are asking people for goods  and things and telling them exactly where to bring them and what they need, you know.  So, check those out and do whatever you can in that respect.  Last night, my girlfriend donated, I guess, like about 100 rain slickers because it was  going to rain.  So, that's, you know, common sense thinking right there. 
[01:03:00]  Smart.  You know, they need stuff like that.  I hear they're in desperate need of generators.  So, if, you know, in your garage, you got an old Honda generator or something that you're  not using for anything, they could use it.  Right.  Cool.  All right.  Let's move on to Fran.  Fran, you're next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Thank you.  Hey, Fran.  Hi.  How are you?  Pretty good.  I just wanted to say, I wanted to give my sympathy to all the families that are out there. 
[01:03:30]  Um, unfortunately, my husband was also there.  He was saved.  Fortunately, he was a very lucky man.  He was in when the Twin Towers were being built and unfortunately, he will, he was there  when they came down as well.  Wow.  Um, he finds, he's very traumatized at this point, I would say.  Um, he, I, I just, my, my sympathy to, to all the people who have not found their loved 
[01:04:00]  ones.  We waited hours to hear from him, um, where, we were miraculously lucky because he was supposed  to be working, um, on the 60th floor and, what, 68th floor, but materials didn't come. 
[01:04:30]  He works in the elevator industry.  So, we had to go into the basement to work and, um, the walkie-talkie was the only thing  that saved him because they told him to get out of the building.  Um, as I said, I, I, I don't want to go on with such a depressing story because our lives  will never be the same.  Yeah.  Well, one of your stories is actually one of the good ones, you know, because, uh, he got  out, you know.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Um, kind of makes things like when he leaves a sock on the floor, uh, not matter too much 
[01:05:00]  anymore.  All those little things that you fight over, just, it doesn't matter anymore.  It made me realize how much I truly, really love my husband and how much we really mean  to each other.  Yeah, you know, I learned a lot, too.  I, you, you, you learned, uh, you shouldn't take anything for granted.  Absolutely.  And I think, as, especially as Americans, we really, we really do.  I, you know, I, I can't wait to see my family this weekend.  I can't wait to hang out with them.  You know, but the sad part is that these people, all of the, all of the survivors are 
[01:05:30]  feeling, because I know my husband had felt some guilt as well.  Um, you know, why am I alive and somebody else is not?  Yeah.  And they go through different stages, um, as a survivor.  But what, what we...  I can't listen to her say the word survivor.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I keep thinking of Celine Dion.  What we, what we, what we looked, what we looked at on TV and what they saw, was seen  through totally different eyes.  What they lived through, um, having to run for their lives. 
[01:06:00]  My husband actually thought that, um, they were going to die.  They, their, their idea was to get the people out of the building because he hadn't even realized  that it was a plane.  He thought it was a bomb.  Yeah.  And then they regrouped and they went into the other tower and then that tower got hit.  Yeah.  And then from there they ran out and they were trying to duck all the debris as it was coming  down.  But they didn't even know that the towers were coming down when they started, when they ran. 
[01:06:30]  They thought that once the people, when, when someone told them it was a plane and they  realized that it was a plane, they ran and started running and they heard the rumbling because  they thought that another plane was going to crash down on the people.  They thought, oh my God, they got us in the streets.  Now they're going to shoot us.  And so they ran and kept running and kept running.  It's, it's, it's, the noise, he's, he's traumatized.  I mean, he's not sleeping right. 
[01:07:00]  He's not eating right.  We're going to go out tonight.  Actually, we're going to go out.  I suggest we all go out and get nice and buzzed.  Absolutely.  I tried last night and it just wasn't happening, but sometime over the weekend, I'm going to  get nice and buzzed.  Now the company I'm working for, they're taking up donations and we're going to deliver some  of the goods that, that they need, make him feel like he's done something.  All right.  Hey, Fran, what the hell are you doing on the phone with us?  Can we get with your husband?  I am.  All right.  Thank you. 
[01:07:30]  She needs to, she needs to share.  She needs to vent a little bit, you know?  I'll be this, I'm reading.  Before you move on, because it just, it brought up something I was saying last night.  After everything we've seen this week, how is Hollywood ever going to impress us again?  You know something?  Think about that.  That's amazing.  Yeah.  How is Hollywood, when we get back to some type of normalcy in our lives, how is Hollywood  going to come out with that next action movie or blockbuster that is really going to impress 
[01:08:00]  us?  Right.  We'll be like, oh yeah, yeah, that's good.  Yeah.  Yeah, okay, cool.  Yeah.  How do you, how do you beat that?  Who's going to be the first one to put out a movie that, that has something like that  in it?  Aside from the movie about this.  They're already writing scripts, my friend.  I'm sure.  They've already pulled three or four movies.  Yeah, there was that one movie, Big Trouble with Tim Allen has been pulled.  The Last Castle, Robert Redford and James Gandolfini, they pulled the billboards and posters  because it's got the American flag upside down. 
[01:08:30]  But these had come out before this had happened.  Yeah, there's a few other movies that they've pulled because of this.  Schwarzenegger's new movie has been pulled.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All the Spider-Man promotional stuff has been pulled.  Well, who can forget the trailer for the new Spider-Man movie that's coming out in what,  2002?  Spider-Man puts the spider web between the Twin Towers and catches the helicopter with the  thieves in it.  And how to pull that?  Of course.  And all the posters for the movie have Spider-Man and the reflection in his eyes is the Twin Towers. 
[01:09:00]  It just became, it was such a huge part of everyone's life.  Lou from Morristown, Jersey.  You have to talk about what England did yesterday during the changing of the guard.  For the first time ever in their country, they played the Star-Spangled Banner.  Wow.  During the changing of the guard.  Gotta love that Tony Blair over there.  That's something.  He rocks.  Tony Blair does rock. 
[01:09:30]  Knows how to speak, too.  And these are people that, you know.  Speaks eloquently.  We kicked their ass a couple hundred years ago, and now they're all right.  They're good Joes.  They understand.  They help us, and they back us with anything we want to do.  You know, they'll be right there, too.  Those RAF guys.  Okay, yes, yes.  You want us to fly in with a Toronado?  And drop a few bombs, rather.  There.  McBrag.  The world of Commander McBrag.  There we are.  Afghanistan. 
[01:10:00]  I had nothing but a pea shooter and a little hat with a propeller on it.  Whatever did you do, McBrag?  All right.  Hey, Ant, I pulled a song today that I want to play.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I figured instead of, like, you know, potting up a news station, because we want to regroup  and, you know, take a quick leak and see what we got on the phones.  We got the Vince McMahon thing we want to play.  Do we have any of the other WWF superstars?  Yeah, I pulled a bunch of them.  I listened to them for hope right there.  I'd pop that up, and they're all carded up.  Like, I want to hear what The Rock said. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, yeah.  I got The Rock, Stone Cold, Rubber Ray.  We can do it right after the song.  It'll just give us, like, four minutes to regroup instead of, you know, throwing on CNN  or something.  I got you.  And I think this song is self-explanatory, and I would just suggest you listen to the  words closely, okay?  Mm-hmm.  It's The Foo Fighters, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:11:00]  A couple phone numbers if you're in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else in the country that picks up our show, 866-2774.  Wow.  Foo Fighters and My Hero.  First time we've played a song on our show in a long time.  Yeah.  All right.  Pretty appropriate.  We got the Vince McMahon clip.  We got phones ringing off the hook like crazy. 
[01:11:30]  What do you want to do?  You want to do the Vince thing?  Yeah, I want to hear what Vince said.  Okay.  I guess SmackDown ran around the rest of the country.  It didn't run here in New York with all the news coverage.  And Vince and, I guess, a bunch of the WWF superstars had their own views and speeches  on the situation.  One guy called us earlier and said that Vince McMahon just got him really, really pumped.  Yeah.  You know Vince.  Let's check this out. 
[01:12:00]  Good evening, ladies and children, and welcome to Houston, Texas for a very special live edition  of World Wrestling Federation SmackDown.  U.S.A.  U.S.A.  U.S.A.  U.S.A.  U.S.A.  U.S.A.  U.S.A.  U.S.A.  U.S.A.  U.S.A.  U.S.A.  U.S.A.  Tonight, the spirit of America lives here in Houston, Texas.  On behalf of everyone here in the arena and a worldwide television audience, we would 
[01:12:30]  like to extend our condolences to the victims and the families and friends of the victims  of the terrorist acts that occurred on Tuesday in New York City and Washington, D.C. 
[01:13:00]  Our nation's leaders have encouraged us to return to living our lives the way we normally  do.  Our nation's leaders have encouraged us to continue to live our lives the American way.  They've encouraged us to practice and exercise our constitutional rights. 
[01:13:30]  And as such, tonight I believe this is the first public assembly of its size since the tragedy  of Tuesday.  Make no mistake.  Uh-oh.  About what, and make no mistake about the message, this public assembly is sending to  terrorism tonight.  And that message, quite simply, is that we will not live our lives in fear. 
[01:14:00]  The citizens of Houston are not afraid.  The citizens of Houston are not afraid.  The citizens of Texas are indeed not afraid.  And by God, the citizens of the United States are not afraid. 
[01:14:30]  Sounds like Nuremberg.  The citizens of Houston are not afraid.  The citizens of Houston are not afraid.  The citizens of Houston are not afraid. 
[01:15:00]  The citizens of Houston are not afraid.  The citizens of Houston are not afraid.  The citizens of Houston are not afraid.  The citizens of Houston are not afraid.  The citizens of Houston are not afraid.  The citizens of Houston are not afraid.  The citizens of Houston are not afraid. 
[01:15:30]  They are not afraid, but the citizens of Houston are not afraid.  The World Wrestling Federation would like to thank each and every one of you here in the Compaq Center tonight. 
[01:16:00]  The World Wrestling Federation would like to thank each and every one of you watching on television.  We would like to thank you for the honor and privilege of performing before you here tonight.  How about that?  Vince is used to dealing with tragedy. Remember the XFL? 
[01:16:30]  Let's go to Mike, who's at Ground Zero. He's a volunteer. Mike, what's up?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  You can't imagine what it looks like down here. You've got to see it to believe it.  Thanks. I'll leave that to the pros.  I'm trying to get down there.  Well.  I want to be down there. I want to take it all in.  Well, you want to?  Yeah. I've seen all the pictures. I just, yeah, I do.  You want to?  Yeah, I do. I want to see it.  Tomorrow?  Yeah. No problem. 
[01:17:00]  Listen, this cell phone's dying. Can I give you the number of the other cell phone I have?  Well, just say what you have to say real fast.  Okay, well, tomorrow morning we're making another run. We need dog food, hot dogs, coffee, ketchup, mustard. We need help.  All right.  All right.  Phone's crapping out down there, I guess.  All right. Hopefully he'll call back because I want to know where you'd bring this stuff. That's the other thing. Where do you bring this stuff?  You can't get close to ground zero, really. So what, do you bring it to the perimeter they got set up and just hand it in? 
[01:17:30]  The closest you can get, maybe.  That's something we haven't found out yet. Someone should, you know, let us in on that info.  Right?  Yeah.  All right.  I thought Rick was setting up more clips. Like, you want to hear The Rock and Stone Cold and all that.  Oh, sure.  You got to hear what The Rock, The Rock says we're going to kick their candy asses. 
[01:18:00]  How layeth the smackdown on Osama Bin Laden?  If you smile a little...  I mean, how ridiculous.  Yeah, at least it's giving me kind of a laugh.  Oh, my God. I really just have to chuckle.  Rick is socializing outside the...  Yeah, Rick's...  Yeah, there's a show going on, but it's time to produce a show again.  I guess Rick's holding a conversation.  Rick, do you have the other clips? I thought you had the other clips of The Rock and stuff.  They're ready.  Well, we want to go to them.  Yeah, how about that? 
[01:18:30]  The guests we invited are here.  We don't need guests.  Matt from D.C., what's going on?  What?  Not a lot.  My uncle's a D.C. firefighter.  Yeah.  And he was down there within, like, an hour of the crash happening.  He was a sergeant with the D.C. firefighters.  And he was sent in probably around 2 in the morning walking around in the halls of the Capitol building, I mean, of the Pentagon, and was just describing, like, some of the stuff I talked to him the other night.  He walked into one of the conference rooms over on the side there. 
[01:19:00]  And everybody, there was a bunch of people sitting around the conference table, but they were all dead.  Yeah.  They were basically just either flash-fried or fuel, jet fuel splashed on them.  And, I mean, it looked like they were living people sitting around, but they're all dead.  Yeah.  And after a couple hours of, you know, doing all this work, he was laying down outside with one of his buddies.  You know, they were just taking a break.  And a Secret Service agent, not a Secret Service, an FBI agent walked up to them and was like, excuse me, you know, I need to collect evidence. 
[01:19:30]  They're looking around like, what are you talking about?  Ask them to get up.  And their pieces, I mean, the biggest they saw was the size of a silver dollar.  Smallest was about the size of a dime.  Just airplane pieces, human flesh.  I mean, just, it was ridiculous.  Oh, and they were sitting right on it?  Yeah, I mean, they had no clue.  Yeah.  So, just want to thank you guys for doing what you're doing, giving people a chance to get a voice out.  And hopefully to Monday you'll be able to get back to doing, you know, joking around. 
[01:20:00]  Well, our plan is to, by Monday, start heading in that direction.  Yeah.  You know, I don't think you just completely turn this off and go, okay, let's get back to, you know, what we do best.  You guys were also talking about having the rest of your family come down today.  What's up with that?  No, not family.  No, I mean, the O&A family.  Well, we've been kind of isolated like everyone else, you know.  I mean, we do a type of show here that we have a lot of people that are involved with it, and we've been out of contact with them. 
[01:20:30]  And it would just feel good, and for selfish reasons, to be around people that you have fun with.  Yeah, you want to hear Norton and stuff down there.  Well, it would just be cool to see some familiar faces, because, you know, for the last few days it's been tough to let anyone into our building, you know.  No one wanted to come to work.  Our interns finally showed up today for the first time.  Yeah.  You know, I don't blame them for not showing up.  But, you know, we just want to get some faces around here.  That's all.  So, all right, Matt. 
[01:21:00]  Thanks.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Want to go to the Rock?  Oh, yeah, I do, but this guy was, uh.  Uh, John, real fast.  Hey, what's up, guys?  I just left downtown in the city, and it's the sickest feeling when you look up, and it's F-15 fighter jets circling downtown Manhattan.  It's just unreal.  They are just making one big circle around the island, right?  Oh, yeah.  They're just looking for somebody's butt to kick.  The other thing is, you guys. 
[01:21:30]  Doesn't that make you tingle inside?  It's just like, oh, yeah.  It really does.  It just makes you feel a lot safer knowing that the boys are up there looking down on you, you know?  See, I think a lot of us as Americans have forgotten how powerful this country is.  You know, the military has kind of been, you know, kind of out of sight for a while.  It's just been kind of out of sight.  You sort of know it's there.  But, man, you see these F-15s flying overhead.  You're like, oh, that's right.  We got some hardware.  Go down and look into the harbor.  Look at the aircraft carrying all the other little pretty boats sitting out there just looking for somebody's ass to kick. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, right on, man.  And listen, also, if you guys are looking to drop stuff off, the Javits Center is like the main place to like go.  If you have any questions or to drop stuff off, that is the place to go.  That is definitely the place.  Yeah, I did see that on TV.  Okay.  The other thing was, oh, that story you were talking about earlier about the 10 cops buried or whatever.  Yeah.  I go into work real early and, what do you call it, 10-10 was talking about it early.  Yeah.  They supposedly arrested a cop's wife because she called in that phony call. 
[01:22:30]  And why would she do that?  I don't know.  They said they weren't sure why she did it.  That's what 10-10 was reporting at like 4.30, quarter to 5 this morning.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden they stopped talking about it.  I don't know if they told them, listen, shut up.  We don't want that kind of news out or whatever.  Yeah, all right.  But there's some crazy ass people out there and, you know, they should just keep their mouths shut.  We don't need that kind of stuff right now.  We have really tried on this show not to go with rumors.  We've, you know, because, I mean, everyone is trying to, I don't, all right. 
[01:23:00]  Thank you, bro.  All right.  Listen, we need a friendly face in the studio.  I'll come down.  I'll give you a big hug, all right?  No.  Well, no.  We got, you know what I'm saying.  We got some people showing up just to kind of hang, you know?  All right, boys.  Stay strong.  All right, John.  Take it easy.  Thanks.  Software giant Microsoft said Friday it would remove the World Trade Center from the New York landscape  in the upcoming Flight Simulator games that they're putting out.  Flight Simulator 2002, the latest version, lets players fly a variety of airplanes, 
[01:23:30]  including commercial jets like the Boeing 747, around areas like New York City, Las Vegas, and Seattle.  So, you won't be seeing the Twin Towers in any of the Microsoft Flight Simulator software.  All right.  We got what The Rock said last night on SmackDown, Anthony.  First and foremost, I have to say that I can't.  Oh, it's Dwayne.  It's not The Rock.  This is Dwayne.  Dwayne Johnson.  Dwayne Johnson.  The pain and the suffering and the anguish.  The Rock says. 
[01:24:00]  Families and friends of the victims are going through.  We're going to turn that bomb sideways, shine it on this real ice, and stick it straight up their candy ass.  24 hours a day.  Thank you.  Sifting through the rubble and looking for any remnants of life.  It's difficult to talk about this.  And I will say that I can't, I couldn't imagine what it must be like to be there. 
[01:24:30]  I couldn't imagine, I couldn't imagine if my own family were there.  We need Superman, not Clark Kent.  I, uh...  What's he doing?  I will offer my condolences and certainly say that everyone is in my heart and in my prayers.  And I, uh, I just want to say, uh, to everyone out there, again, to the families and friends of the victims and everyone involved, is to just stay strong. 
[01:25:00]  Just stay strong.  If you smell a little of...  Yeah, Dominic from Levittown said the rock was very somber.  Bradshaw and Taz, very animated from what I hear.  If you want to pull the clips from those guys.  Who else we got, Rick?  I got, uh, Stone Cold.  Stone Cold.  I wonder how he played it.  I don't have anything philosophical to say or anything's going to change the world. 
[01:25:30]  Ever.  I just know that I was given an opportunity to speak about what's happened, so all I have to offer is my opinion.  And, uh, in my opinion, what I think is, uh, the people who did this are nothing but a bunch of complete cowards.  Uh, my heart goes out to anybody that lost loved ones in this whole ordeal.  And, uh, I think that tonight, uh, by going back to work with the World Wrestling Federation, I think it's, uh, I think it's the thing to do.  It feels strange, and I've had this, uh, I've had this bad feeling come over me ever since this whole thing has happened, and it doesn't seem like I can shake it. 
[01:26:00]  But, uh, as a person, and I think, uh, as a country, we have to shake it.  Uh, we have to mourn, uh, the losses of the people that we knew, but we have to, uh, we have to get back, we have to get the gears rolling again.  And that's what we're here to do tonight.  Uh, what happened this past Tuesday was the worst thing that I've ever seen in my life.  And, uh, I hope that I'll never, ever see anything like this again, except to the people that, when we find out who did this, get a payback. 
[01:26:30]  Because they deserve a payback.  There you go.  They deserve exactly what they have coming.  That's what people want to hear.  All right.  Ray, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Pretty good.  All right, listen, I got a quick comment on something.  You guys were looking for a Superman.  I just got something I wrote.  You guys had a girl yesterday read you a whole poem or whatever.  This is not anything like that, but I just got a brief statement, if you don't mind.  Yeah.  And then a comment on the, uh, possibility of, uh, of coming strikes on, uh, the people that did this. 
[01:27:00]  But, uh, what I wrote was, um, that I'd like to tell the people who are responsible for this, anyone that's like that, that the gates are, the gates have been opened.  The Reaper is coming, and he's riding a Humvee draped in desert camo.  He's carrying an M16 in one hand and Old Glory in the other, and he'll be singing the Battle Hymn of the Republic all the damn way.  And he'll die before he comes home.  Or he'll finish the job.  Nice.  What's that?  Very nice image you conjure up there.  Hey, I'm sorry.  I'm more on the angry side than I am on the morning side. 
[01:27:30]  I don't know anyone there.  I don't know anyone that was hurt.  Don't get me wrong.  I feel it.  But more than anything, you know, I'm a 27-year-old guy.  All I can see right now is big stuff in the Middle East in the long run.  I see the potential of long-term warfare with people who are not going to like what we do to the people that did this.  And I'm angry.  I'm real angry that these people hate us so much because they can't obtain legitimately what they want so bad, which is the money that they claim they despise that we have.  All they want is to have it.  They're mad that they don't have it. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  They're jealous of the lifestyle we lead here that we...  Precisely.  Now, just on the more intellectual side, if you don't mind.  Yeah.  You guys were talking about upcoming possible imminent strikes in the near, near future?  Yeah.  I think there's a very good possibility you could see something over the weekend.  And my indication is, my reasoning for this is, the economy is in danger.  The stock market has been scheduled to reopen on Monday, which is heavily dependent on people's emotions.  Optimism feeds the economy, and fear destroys it.  And I know that they're going to be very, very terrified of the idea of opening the American stock market back up with morale like it is now. 
[01:28:30]  There are a lot of people touting and tooting like they're, you know, real badasses and stuff like that.  But I think there are a lot of people on this planet, in this country right here especially, who are scared right now.  And where their money is concerned, they're going to be very cautious.  Now, however, they might be able to offset something like that with some early retaliatory strikes.  That could be the kind of good news that would fuel people to not lift all of their money back out of this market that was already in such jeopardy.  I know that originally we're scheduled to open the stock market back up on Thursday, then Friday. 
[01:29:00]  And they've moved it to Monday, and they've given a whole host of reasons why they might do that, which all are pretty legitimate.  But the possibility of a true depression is real.  It's very real.  We were real close to teetering on.  Yeah, well, consumer confidence is, you know, is nonexistent right now.  Exactly.  No one wants to go out and buy, you know, any of those luxury items or anything like that.  I think part of the way Americans will support the United States is also economically and by not just pulling all their money out and having confidence that if the market goes down, it's a good buy opportunity. 
[01:29:30]  That's all.  You know what I mean?  That's very true.  I think Americans will rally economically, too, just like we have militarily and spiritually.  I agree 100% in the long term.  In the near term, you know, confidence is affected by additional fear.  You got, like you said, nobody's going to yank necessarily all of their money out. 
[01:30:00]  But the first thing that will happen if a large number of people do is, first, a lot of venture capitalists lose their money.  They have to re-raise it before they can put it back into the market or into the public markets, you know, the retail establishment and things like that, your consumer confidence issues.  The first thing that happens is if people start majorly selling off.  I mean, we've got protections in place now to protect us from that, you know, to protect major, major fall off since the crash.  But it could affect us, and I think that they may play into that.  I mean, it would behoove them, even if something minor was done, you know, a cruise missile strike. 
[01:30:30]  If I was a betting man, we're making a major statement tomorrow.  Yes.  Sunday at the latest.  Wow.  I sure hope so, and I sure hope that we...  But that's not all, you know, this is going to take a long time.  Yeah.  I think everyone is starting to understand that now.  But I think, like you were saying, it's very important to make a statement, and we need that statement sooner than later at this point.  Yes, sir.  I believe today is the day, you know, where it's a day of mourning, and then we're getting down to business starting tomorrow or Sunday. 
[01:31:00]  That's my gut feeling.  It's mine, too, and I sure as heck hope we're both right.  Well, all right, Ray, thank you.  As always, thank you.  All right, bro.  Take care.  You know who I would love to talk to today is our buddy, Stockbroker Dave.  Yeah, where is he?  I'm sure he's dealing with a lot.  He's a really good friend of ours from the first day we started broadcasting here in New York City, and, you know, he's a Wall Street bigwig, basically. 
[01:31:30]  You know, he knows a lot of people.  He was right there when this whole thing was going down, and...  Yeah, it would be interesting to hear what he has to say.  If someone knows how to get a hold of him today, please let us know or tell Dave.  We would love to talk to him, okay?  Mm-hmm.  Ben's got some things coming in.  Ben, why don't you just, because you're writing all sorts of notes, but you know what you're writing, so just...  This comes from a guy directly on Ground Zero, what they really need.  They need instant and regular coffee, coffee filters, milk, dog food, and hot dogs. 
[01:32:00]  That's the big stuff that they really need.  That's coming from a guy.  And people could just send that, bring it to the Javits Center.  Javits Center, yeah, bring that.  That's what they really need.  That's what he said.  And then in Boston, as far as Sunday at Waterworks in Quincy from 12 to 8, all money.  Whether you, you know, when you pay the cover, you buy a beer, food, anything, is going to the New York Fire Department and Police Department's families.  So that's Waterworks in Quincy, Mass on Sunday.  Very cool.  All right. 
[01:32:30]  I think there's a bunch of things going on on Long Island that we've got to get to a little later.  Right?  Right.  What's that?  I think I've got to leave this one.  What?  Medical Marijuana Barbie wants to come in.  What the hell?  Why?  She's upstairs and she's claiming that, you know, she should be in or whatever.  I don't know.  What could she possibly have to add to this?  I mean, her cause of medical marijuana has nothing really to do with this. 
[01:33:00]  Well, you know, you piqued my interest.  Now we've got to, like, see what she's thinking about.  If she starts pushing her cause, I'm going to push her right out the door, though.  John, what's going on?  What's going on, O&A?  As long as the naked cowboy doesn't show up, I think we'll be okay today.  John.  Yeah.  No, I just want to respond to what that gentleman was just talking about two minutes ago about what's going to happen with the markets and whatnot.  I work on Wall Street.  I work in an investment bank on Wall Street. 
[01:33:30]  At first, things aren't going to be so good.  But if you look historically towards World War II, I don't want to bore you guys to death, but historically, after World War II, we did really good.  We did an upshot.  I think what's going to happen is come Monday, there's not going to be a lot of activity.  Everything is going to be as boring as possible.  But if the long term, I think, historically, if you look at every single war, the markets have done really well.  So I think that we should all come out of this really, really well.  So I wouldn't worry so much about the market in the long term. 
[01:34:00]  But, again, that's looking at history.  We don't know how long this is going to happen.  We don't know when the first event is going to happen.  But if you look historically long term, it's the short term that's freaking people out because nobody knows what's going to happen in the short term because, like the U.S. has said, nobody's buying anything.  Nobody's buying the big-ticket items.  Nobody's going to be buying stock.  Everybody was already losing money and working on debt as it was.  A lot of people now are out of work.  Now, think of all the companies that just totally have lost employees, have lost customer information. 
[01:34:30]  All those computers in the World Trade Center that came down, all the client files, that has to be rebuilt.  And that's going to take some time.  But initially, we're going to be stable.  It's the long term, I think, for those people out there who have the 401Ks or those people who have some positions in the stock market.  I think if everybody holds and just stays steady, doesn't go short, obviously, nobody's going to go long, we should be okay.  All right, man.  You guys have been doing a great job, by the way.  Keep it up.  All right.  Thank you, bro.  Take care.  Bye.  Bye.  Well, Medical Marijuana Barbie, whatever her stupid name is, is here. 
[01:35:00]  Bill, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  All right.  Just want to say, you guys are doing a fabulous job.  I just want to say my heart and prayer goes out to all those workers in the city.  And I just came off the Verrazano, watching them jets fly over, watching the U.S. Coast Guard sitting there in the water waiting.  Man, what a good feeling.  All I got to say is lock and load America, because they got to pay.  All right.  Thanks, bro.  That's it.  Have a good one, guys. 
[01:35:30]  There's a very strange thing going on on TV right now.  The president is at ground zero.  Zero, excuse me.  The mayor is there.  Hillary's there.  Chuck Schumer is there.  Charles Wrangler.  Charles Wrangler.  Charlie Wrangler.  Governor Pataki and a bunch of others.  I can't really see their faces right now.  And it's really strange.  They're kind of all just hanging out, talking, and checking out the damage.  And there is obviously some light conversation going on.  They're kind of smiling and chuckling to each other. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, that's weird.  But I don't know what to make of it.  Hopefully they're like, you should see what the hell we're sending over there.  You know, just wait until they get a look at that.  Wouldn't you love to be a fly on the wall to hear what they're saying that is making them just chuckle a little bit?  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  I mean, obviously, you do stuff like that to relieve the tension.  I'm sure we've all been to a wake or something.  And you're in the back of the room.  And, you know, you laugh and joke a little bit just to relieve a little tension. 
[01:36:30]  You know, I would just love to hear what they're saying right now.  I know.  Huh.  Well, you know, Bush is down there checking out the scene, which is still just smoking away.  It smelled so bad when I got home last night.  The wind had changed and it was blowing back over Brooklyn.  And it smells like when the stereo kind of burns and, you know, a big puff of smoke comes out of your stereo. 
[01:37:00]  Is that electronics burning smell?  That's pretty much what it was.  All right.  You want to hear Taz?  You said it?  I would rather hear Stephanie.  You want to hear Stephanie?  Yeah.  I want to hear Stephanie because I hear she.  Somebody said when you hear Stephanie's speech, you will think that they replaced her brain with implants, too.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Like she's just she maybe maybe it's great when she gets out on stage and starts talking about Triple H and how, you know, she's going to kick ass. 
[01:37:30]  But when she's talking about real events, I don't think she can pull it off.  Let's hear Stephanie McMahon.  A few years ago, some people tried to destroy my family.  What?  They attacked my father's reputation.  They attacked my mother's reputation.  And they attacked the World Wrestling Federation.  What?  They tried to rip us apart.  She's not going here, is she?  All they did was make my family stronger.  Oh, no.  And that's exactly how America feels right now. 
[01:38:00]  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You mean to tell me that when all that stuff was going down with Vince McMahon and she's talking about the steroid allegations in the WWF.  You mean to tell me, Stephanie, that that is the same thing as what happened in New York and Washington?  Stephanie.  Stephanie. 
[01:38:30]  No matter what, you still have all your millions.  Yeah.  I don't think it really comes close.  Like the Twin Towers on my chest.  What?  What is she?  Oh, brother.  Let me hear the rest of this annoying woman.  Because on Tuesday, America was attacked.  But America is a united nation.  And together, we stand strong.  I am incredibly proud to be an American citizen. 
[01:39:00]  And I will stand up for my rights and my freedom.  What?  Oh, my God.  I will be used as a flotation device.  She's lost her acting mind.  The Navy has called me.  Yeah.  I will be a troop transport.  I will be shuttling our men and women overseas with my breast implants.  Oh, my God.  What else do you want to hear?  Oi.  Brian from Boston.  Opie just made a prediction that as a betting man, we will strike back over the weekend. 
[01:39:30]  Thanks.  Now your damn curse is going to come into play and nothing's going to happen this weekend.  Oh, no.  This is not a sports curse.  A sports prediction, my friend.  See?  I still can't get over Stephanie.  A few years ago.  No, we don't need to hear it again.  That's so good.  My family was attacked.  Do you remember a couple of years ago, I was attacked by the undertaker and locked in the boiler room. 
[01:40:00]  So, instead of being worth $800 million today, if they had their way, we'd only be worth $400 million as a family.  You've got to be kidding me.  Last year, tragedy struck my family in the form of the XFL.  Oh, my God, Stephanie.  Stop.  Ariella wants in.  Ariella.  Yeah.  Hey.  Last year, I ordered takeout, and it was cold, and I was very upset, and I'm upset today. 
[01:40:30]  I had a pair of shoes that didn't fit, and do people know what it's like to walk around with your feet hurting in a pair of designer shoes that are supposed to fit and don't?  Oh, my God, Stephanie McMahon.  Ariella?  Yeah.  Hi.  What do you have to hit?  Hmm?  What do you have to add?  Um, I have a poem. 
[01:41:00]  Okay.  It's, um, a, an uplifting kind of, um, thing.  Okay.  Um, you'd like me to read it?  Sure.  Um, four planes crashed, three buildings wrecked, two towers felled, one country in chaos.  Thousands of lives, thousands of lives, thousands of lives were stolen, millions of lives, millions of lives are changed.  All of us are coming together to overcome this tragedy. 
[01:41:30]  The last millennium we felt safe, and now we feel in danger, but as one will make it through and become a stronger nation.  We've reached a new era.  We've reached a new day.  Goodbye, towers of yesterday.  Oh, that's uplifting.  I mean, it's good and everything, and it really kind of tells what happened, but it's just sad.  I think it's uplifting.  I mean, it shows how we're kind of, you know, we'll get through it okay.  And you're venting.  That's cool.  Yeah. 
[01:42:00]  All right, Arielle.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  I'm Stephanie McMahon, and I want to say something.  I have sort of a kind of a brain.  This, uh, this next phone call could be really tough.  Why not?  We've known for many, many years.  Stockbroker Dave.  Hi, Hope.  What's up?  How you doing, man?  Hanging in there.  It's been a tough couple of days, but, uh, it's just, uh, unbelievable the stories that we're hearing.  Were you, uh, in at work when, when?  No, thank God. 
[01:42:30]  Uh, my two, my two brothers were on the floor, but, uh, I was on the, uh, extension heading towards the Holland Tunnel, and I saw the fire, and then I saw the second plane hit the, uh, about, and speak to everybody on the floor, and they said, we close the exchange, just turn around and go home.  And I was stuck and bumping them over the traffic.  I couldn't move.  Yeah.  But, uh, I just made sure my two brothers were out, and then I spoke to two, uh, all my clerks, made sure they got out, and I thank God everybody was safe.  So, everyone you know got out safe?  Everybody I know.  I mean, I know people that are missing, but just basically, you know, friend, you know, friend relationships, nobody very close to me. 
[01:43:00]  Wow.  But, uh, just hearing stories of people, uh, that have lost a lot of friends, and it's, hmm, very tough time.  Yeah.  You know, money means a lot, but now it means, uh, not so much.  Yeah.  What, what do you think's going to happen now when the market opens?  The market's going to be pretty stable.  It's stabilized overseas.  I mean, this could have been the best thing that ever happened to the market.  If we opened up on Tuesday or Wednesday, uh, you would have seen down at least 1,000 points. 
[01:43:30]  But now, uh, with all the huge chance to just take a breather and realize what's going on.  Yeah, I think, I think with everybody rallying support, it's, it's not only support for the military and for, uh, uh, the country.  It's support economically, I think, is going to be there.  I don't think people are just going to start pulling their money out for some kind of a fear of a collapse, uh, uh, of the market, you know?  And I think you hit it right on the head.  Uh, I think, if anything, uh, the markets may act better than everybody expects.  That would be nice.  Uh, nobody wants to pull their money out, of course. 
[01:44:00]  And, uh, but you should see on Monday when we open up at 9.30, you should see a positive reaction.  That would be great.  That would be, you know, very good.  But, you know, you just hope for, you know, it just could be very sad going to work.  On, uh, Monday being, and have thousands of dead bodies underneath you.  Yeah.  That's the, that's the toughest part.  We're so gross on TV on, uh, I believe it was Wednesday.  And we definitely thought it was going to open because usually that's the way we operate.  Business as usual.  But they finally took the human factor into it and said it's best that we just take a, take a time out and let everybody breathe. 
[01:44:30]  Right.  I'm very proud of him.  Uh, he usually, well, it's a federal law that we can't be open.  And we can't be closed, uh, four days in a row.  Right.  Yeah.  So, uh, we definitely thought we'd be open on Thursday, if not Friday.  But it's just, it's good to see them take the human factor into, uh, into the equation.  How are you boys doing? 
[01:45:00]  Uh, we're, we're, we're doing all right.  Like, I'm so, like, tired of the whole thing.  I mean, you know, it's, I'm disgusted and I'm, I'm sick of hearing about it.  And, you know, I, I just, I, I wish it would just go away.  It's time to go on.  It really is.  I mean, every, every station you turn it on.  Yeah.  I saw the guy who was, uh, CEO of Canna Fitzgerald.  Oh, man.  Did you see that?  Yeah.  And unfortunately, that's the main vein of turning everybody on Wall Street is everybody  has friends at Canna Fitz. 
[01:45:30]  And, uh, to watch that man, I mean, he lost his, he lost his family.  And, uh, to see him break down like that.  My wife and I last night, it made us both break down.  Yeah.  Because I assume you guys are pretty damn tough and don't really show much emotion.  And you've told us stories about what happens on that floor that when someone dropped dead  of a heart attack on the trading floor and people were just trading over him until the  EMS workers pulled him out.  Yeah.  That's Wall Street.  That's Wall Street.  That's, uh, that's, uh, you know, guys that usually don't show much emotion, you know,  but, uh, to see the, one of these guys just completely break down, I could barely watch 
[01:46:00]  this morning.  I mean, that guy, you know, he has everything in the world.  He has more money than, uh, anybody can imagine, but, uh, have that lose that many people.  And to have that, those, that many families disrupted, you just can't, uh, fathom it.  And he broke down and everybody that saw him also broke down around him.  Right.  I mean, it's, uh, he lost, he lost more than anybody.  He lost 700 of his closest friends.  Uh-huh.  And that is unfathomable.  700. 
[01:46:30]  You know, and, uh, all I hear is that other, even their competitors are pitching in just  to help them out.  And, you know, that's the good side of Wall Street is that when someone's in trouble like  that, we always, you know, if somebody gets hurt, we're always there, the first to write  a check.  Yeah.  And, uh, I believe that they're going to take care of all these families financially and  make sure that they're safe, that they're protected, that they don't lose their homes.  And that's a very important, uh, side of Wall Street that people usually don't get to see.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:47:00]  But, uh, nobody's looking forward to going to work on Monday.  That's it, guys.  And, uh...  Yeah, we're going to want to hear from you on Monday.  I appreciate it, bud.  I appreciate the call.  I really do.  So, okay, cool, Dave.  Uh, hope you guys are well and hope to see you very shortly.  Right on.  Can you hold on for a second, Dave?  You got it, Hope.  All right, cool.  Our buddy, Stockbrook.  Dave, great to hear that he's okay and, uh, everyone he knows got out.  Uh, Lady Di.  Oh, God.  I'm not even going to fake it.  What a horrible, horrible tragedy that happened on Tuesday, huh?  Oh, I thought the tragedy that happened with you at the VMAs. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, no.  No, no.  No, um, I wanted to tell you that I saw the whole thing from across the airport and I was just  devastated.  It was really, really sad.  From across the airport.  From across the airport where I work at.  I saw the whole thing right there.  Yeah.  So, I mean, you know, you see it from right there and then they had the televisions on  and I, it's just horrible.  Very, very horrible.  I went to church today.  I donated money and I'm going to give blood.  Mm-hmm.  And Mary's going to do whatever she can.  Well, you stopped drinking for a few days so they get some good blood out of you, right? 
[01:48:00]  I don't drink that much.  I don't drink.  What happens when you give blood?  It comes out ragu?  No, no.  My blood is fine.  I don't drink.  All right.  Good.  Good.  Okay.  So, we're going to...  I hear you're wearing a Malcolm X jacket and the helicopters are landing on you.  No, no.  No.  Come on, guys.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  This is horrible.  I'm hearing you all.  And Mary hopes that you guys are well and we will see you real soon.  All right.  She's in Florida, right?  She's still in Florida.  She's coming back by train supposedly tomorrow.  Oh.  When did she fly out? 
[01:48:30]  She flew out the day before.  Oh, man.  You know, she was devastated.  I was talking to her and I said, I just don't believe this is going to happen.  That would have been a way to terrorize the terrorists.  They walk in the plane just looking at Mary and go, okay, get us off of this plane.  Get us off of this plane.  Come on, guys.  I wanted to come down today, but...  I'm starting to think, Mary, you know, she was on one of those planes and, you know,  talked the hijacker right out of it.  I got a proper comment.  I will not leave this plane.  It's just no time to joke, guys.  I'm not joking.  We're just trying to get a little humor out there. 
[01:49:00]  Just a little.  Just a little, little, little, little humor.  Yeah, but we're just so devastated.  People need a little bit.  I got a proper comment.  And we were crying and everything, and it's just horrible.  She's coming home by train.  I would say tomorrow.  That's what she has planned.  And, you know, like I said, she left Monday, and when she heard about this whole thing,  she called me.  She asked me if I was all right, and I said, I'm fine.  You know, but we're just, you know, we're just, we thank God there was nobody that we know in that tragedy.  And I say prayers for everyone that was in that tragedy. 
[01:49:30]  All right, Lady Di.  You know?  Okay.  Okay?  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  No problem.  We'll see you guys soon.  Oh, great.  All right.  Okay.  Looking forward to it.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Lady Di.  Corey.  Corey.  Hey, yeah.  Were you chuckling?  Yeah, because you guys crack me up when you talk to her.  Isn't it something?  Oh, I have a positive, uplifting story.  Okay.  My aunt was working on the 51st floor of the first building, and I live out in Jersey. 
[01:50:00]  And I'm originally a New Yorker, but we didn't know anything, you know, as far as information about her.  And, see, I'm Puerto Rican, and in a Puerto Rican family, when something like this happens, or, you know, anything close to it.  You have children?  Huh?  Easy.  What?  They lose it.  They lose it.  But we did find my aunt today, thankfully, this morning.  It was, like, about quarter after nine.  She was at one of the hospitals.  She was completely unconscious, and, like...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Okay, slow down.  So she was missing for the last four days, and you finally found out today that she's okay? 
[01:50:30]  Yep.  Because, see, I'm out here in Jersey, and I can't leave my job.  Yeah.  I wasn't allowed to leave to go, you know, search for her, or else I would have, personally.  Right.  But my grandmother, who went into New York City, who can't speak a word of English, and she went to each hospital by, you know, like, one of my relatives helped her out, going from one hospital to the other, looking for my aunt, and they found her.  Wow.  And she's conscious and all that? 
[01:51:00]  She is now, yes, yes.  But she was knocked out from all this, and was she in a coma for a few days?  Yes, she was knocked out.  What happened was, apparently, when they were running down the stairs, she got caught up, and she's, like, a small woman.  I mean, she's, like, four foot two.  And, I mean, she got toppled over by so many people, but some guy picked her up and took him with her, and he left her at the hospital.  So, actually, I mean, I don't know if that guy, I don't know, if we could get in contact with him, we would love to thank him.  Cool. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, but she was dropped off, and we found her.  All right on.  Well, that's good news for you, Corey.  Oh, thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Take care.  All right, bye.  Steve, you put that picture up for...  Oh, yeah, yeah, I grabbed that desktop of the soldiers at Iwo Jima next to the firemen at the World Trade Center.  It's up on the website right now.  Cool.  Cool, man.  Yeah, someone said that to me, and that's my screensaver for now.  Got rid of the naked lady picture that I usually see every morning when I turn on my computer, and I went with that. 
[01:52:00]  And if you go to foundrymusic.com, you can get it from there if you like, okay?  Do we have any more WWF clips from their patriotic speeches they gave at SmackDown last night?  Didn't air here in New York, but I hear it's going to air tomorrow at some point.  Yeah, they're going to rewrite it tomorrow.  There you go.  I just want to give out Steve's website again for the best top picture.  Foundrymusic.com, F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com. 
[01:52:30]  That's our underground website when we're doing a normal show.  So there'll be some interesting things on there.  When we get back to normal, but for now, you've got that desktop picture, okay?  Roy, who are we listening to now?  You want to do Taz?  Taz has been a friend of this show.  He's been on numerous times.  A real badass.  We like the Taz.  He's legit as far as being a badass.  So let's hear what Taz had to say at SmackDown last night. 
[01:53:00]  Besides the Pentagon and the planet went down outside of Pittsburgh and all the bomb scares in New York,  it's scary for me right now to be here in Houston and be this far from my family.  My parents live in Staten Island.  My wife and son, I'm just worried because of all these bomb scares.  I just want to be there to protect them and be there with them.  And I'm not.  I've got to do what I've got to do, and I'm here, and I miss her, and I miss my son.  And these people who are responsible for this, you know, they're going to pay, and they're going to pay hard. 
[01:53:30]  And I don't know who it was, the president or one of these senator people.  Somebody said, you know, we're going to bring them to justice.  Well, to me, that's a load of crap.  Don't bring them to justice.  Bring them down to their knees, to their stomach, until they're not breathing.  You've got to fight force with force, and that's just what they did.  And I don't know when I'm going home, but it'll be in New York. 
[01:54:00]  That's where my home is, and I can't wait to go home.  I don't know what home looks like now, so.  You're going to be surprised.  Taz, my friend, you're going to be surprised.  Oh, is it from Taz?  Hmm.  Sounds like he was cut off.  Let's go to John in Philly.  John, what's up?  Yo, guys.  Hey.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  Listen, first of all, I've got to thank you guys for really doing what you're doing.  I mean, it really does mean a lot to a whole bunch of people, and you're helping us all 
[01:54:30]  out a whole bunch.  But one thing that happened to me yesterday that I hope some of your listeners will like  is just an incredible thing.  I was driving home yesterday, and I live around the battle, by a Brandywine battlefield.  Mm-hmm.  And to give some people an idea where that's at, if you're not around Philadelphia, it's near,  it's about 50 miles from the Valley Forge.  I'm driving to my girlfriend's place, and the sun is in my face, and I'm going uphill. 
[01:55:00]  And as I pass the battlefield, Brandywine battlefield, there is this man on the side of the road.  And as I get closer, you know, I'm taking a good look at him.  He's in full Revolutionary War gear.  He's got his hat off and a rifle in his hand.  And he's just looking straight up and waving his hat almost, it was just eerie.  Wow, that is strange.  But you see it, and it's just, you know, it's just a symbol of patriotism right now. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  I mean, everyone's got a flag flying.  I mean, on any normal day, this guy's a wacko on the side of the road.  Wow, what a great point.  Yeah, that's a great point.  You're like, oh, my God, look at this guy.  It means something completely different.  All of a sudden, you're thinking about the history of this country and what made it great.  Yeah.  And the people that fought for it kind of reminds you of that.  I looked right at him, and I thought, you know, am I going to spin around and take another look at this guy?  And I just thought about it and said, you know what, to me, I mean, that's the ghost of George Washington himself. 
[01:56:00]  He's just standing right there, and he's calling us out again.  But, you know, I just hope some people get enlightened by that a little bit.  But one thing I'd like to know, you know, I mean, you guys are up in the heart of it right now, and I'm someone who's willing.  Is it possible for me to come up and help out?  I mean, will they even let me, you know, put my back into it, or is it you can't even get close to help?  John, I don't have the answer for you because we're hearing, you know, conflicting reports.  We have enough volunteers.  We have enough supplies.  I know they do have a lot of volunteers. 
[01:56:30]  And then we hear, well, we need more volunteers.  We need more supplies.  It's such an incredible undertaking that I don't think they truly know what they want.  I think that what I heard, at least last night, is they need professional volunteers as far as construction, iron workers, welders, steam fitters, things of that nature with credentials and tools and that sort.  Right.  So I don't know if it's just another pair of hands to move debris. 
[01:57:00]  I think here in New York we have potentially millions of volunteers because I don't know one person that wouldn't go down there and pitch in if they were allowed or if they had more room down there.  Yeah, John, I can tell you this.  There are a lot of people heading down there because they just want to help, and they're being turned away.  So they're kind of lining the streets, and they're cheering on the people that are going in, and they're holding up signs and handing out water.  It's really a pretty cool thing to check out. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, I mean, same thing going on down in the city down here in Philadelphia.  I mean, everyone, and I know you guys have heard of it and listening all day, and everyone is behind it down here.  Yeah.  They really are, and we're putting a lot of stuff in.  We're sending a lot of goods up.  I hope some other cities are doing the same thing.  It's just an awesome feeling, and not even that.  I'm trying to go and put a flag in front of my house.  I can't even find one.  I mean, it's just sold out.  They're tough to find, and I just pray people aren't, like, you know, raising the prices of an American flag. 
[01:58:00]  I know.  Can you imagine?  I'm sure someone out there is taking advantage of that part of this, too.  We discussed earlier.  I was walking to the train last night, and there were some Asian people selling pictures of the Twin Towers engulfed in flames in a little cardboard frame.  And what was even more disgusting was that people were buying them.  And I'm pissed off at myself that I didn't say anything. 
[01:58:30]  That's disgraceful.  I was really pissed, and I'm like, man, what is your problem?  Why didn't you speak up and say something?  So, Ant and I, you know, we encourage people to voice your, what's the word?  What?  Outrage.  Yeah, voice your outrage to these people and ask them what the hell they think they're doing.  Yeah, that's really a disgrace.  You know, trying to make a buck off all these people who lost their lives.  Somebody should have kicked that guy in the teeth. 
[01:59:00]  All right.  But, you know, thanks a lot, guys.  Keep up the good work.  All right, John.  Thank you for sharing, man.  That's some good stuff.  All right.  All right.  Let's go back down to D.C.  Andy, what's up?  Hey, Opie, Anthony.  What's up, guys?  What's happening?  Hey, man.  Yeah, I'm a brand new listener for you guys.  I was a little bummed when Donna and Mike left, but you guys, man, you're awesome.  Cool.  Thanks, man.  Hey, man.  And just in these past couple days, I know a lot of people are calling up and saying what you guys are doing is awesome.  But, you know, I'm driving around, and my dad was in the Pentagon, and he's okay. 
[01:59:30]  And it took me about six hours on Tuesday to finally hear his voice.  And, you know, so this whole thing, I mean, you just can't get away from it.  No matter where you go, you're sitting in D.C. traffic.  It's insane.  And it's just crazy.  Whenever you look, you can't shut it out of your mind, even no matter how hard you try.  But, you know, we turn on the radio, and you guys are doing this job of just letting us talk and letting people get on here.  And I'm telling you, man, you guys are humanitarians for what you're doing. 
[02:00:00]  And it's just, I don't know, man.  There's no way I'd get through these past couple days without, one, my dad being okay and, one, having you guys here just to let people talk, man.  Because that's, you know, aside from everything else that we want to do, and people want to get out and get revenge.  And I agree with that totally.  But just hearing everybody talk and letting everybody know that nobody's alone in this is, I don't know, man.  You guys rock. 
[02:00:30]  You guys, and I thank you so much for letting everybody do this.  Thanks, man.  I'd like to be able to say that we, you know, planned it out, that we were going to come on the air and do something.  And let's get on the air and have people appreciate what we do.  We don't know how to do anything else but what we're doing these past few days.  Just kind of getting on and being ourselves and taking calls and whatever, you know.  You know, the one thing about our show, we let the people dictate what we do on a daily basis here, you know. 
[02:01:00]  And this is what they want to do with this radio show.  And, you know, eventually we'll move back to a more entertaining show.  And you guys will let us know when it's time, you know.  I think starting Monday we'll certainly try to get some more entertaining elements into this whole thing just so we can move on a little bit, you know.  Yeah.  Well, it's worked, man.  I think it's helping today with the WWF stuff, Hopi.  It's such a goof to hear the WWF superstars discussing this. 
[02:01:30]  Because aside from the politicians and the people that were affected by this, a lot of the calls that we've taken, these are the first people that I've heard comment on this.  And the fact that it's these WWF superstars, it's killing me.  Only in America.  After hearing these guys, I feel like I have a brain.  So many people in this country, especially I'm a school teacher.  I teach high school, man.  So many of my kids probably think when they hear The Rock or when they hear Stephanie or any of these people talking, that's like, that's the voice of God for somebody. 
[02:02:00]  Right.  I know.  It's just so much.  And they're being real.  Like Taz right there, he wasn't being Taz.  He was being, you know, the guy he is, the New Yorker that he is with family.  The Rock wasn't The Rock.  That was Dwayne Johnson we heard from.  So I kind of, I want to hear the other end.  We're going to go over there, you know.  Yeah.  The smell of the bomb is dropping.  Exactly.  And then Stephanie just, you can tell that unless she's got a storyline to follow. 
[02:02:30]  Cuckoo, cuckoo.  There is nothing going on up there.  It's hysterical to try to hear her comparing what happened Tuesday to her parents' battle with drug allegations.  What do you expect, all that oxygen is going to feed her boobs, her boobs, the blood flow.  The blood flow is unbelievable.  That's the best laugh I've had in two, well, four days now is the flotation devices. 
[02:03:00]  It is nice to get a chuckle every so often.  All right, Andy.  Hey, guys.  You rock.  Thanks for everything, man.  Thank you.  Hang in there down there.  Things are going to be okay.  All right, man.  All right, bro.  Okay.  You want to hear more of that, Ant?  Yeah, I would love to.  This is the highlight of my day today is listening to the WWF superstars.  I think we have Bradshaw.  That's pretty good.  What else do we have?  Have you been able to scrape up any more good ones?  Have you screened some of them?  Because I know there's a website just full of them.  Yeah, we've got a few more.  All right, let's go with Bradshaw's comments from the WWF. 
[02:03:30]  You know, I have heard and I have seen of cowardly acts that have happened before.  The extermination of the Jews by some maniac in Germany.  The bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, what's his name?  God damn, these people are brain surgeons.  The extermination of Jews by some maniac.  Some...  I hope we catch that guy.  I sure hope we get him. 
[02:04:00]  Who is he?  Some maniac.  Who?  Adolf Hitler?  Frickin' Bradshaw, man.  Start this over.  I got to do that again.  Oh, my dear, sweet God.  Not the WWF superstars.  You know, I have heard and I have seen of cowardly acts that have happened before.  Right.  The extermination of the Jews by some maniac in Germany.  The bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City by some maniac.  By some maniac. 
[02:04:30]  Timothy McBain.  By who?  Oh, my God.  Some maniac has attacked America, attacked innocent men, women, and children, husbands, fathers, parents, all because of some religious belief or some other motive that he has.  These people had nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with you.  We're running this show tonight because we're going to show you that you cannot break.  You cannot even bend the fiber, the backbone of the United States of America.  And those sponsors paid big bucks for you to run that show. 
[02:05:00]  There's going to be some critics.  There's going to be some critics that wonder why we run this show.  I want to make this perfectly clear.  Go to hell.  Oh.  We're doing this show because we love America.  This is all we have to give you for tonight is this evening.  If I had to, I'd give my life readily for this country.  Okay.  I have relatives who have done that, who are buried overseas, who are buried in many different places.  My God.  Right.  George W. was one of the greatest.  He's giving them a suplex.  It's time he has become. 
[02:05:30]  It's time he will become a great president.  You guys who are out there, we're going to find your ass.  We're going to make whatever country is hiding in the military a stinking parking lot.  Like they're watching the WWF right now.  God bless this great state I live in.  And God rest the sorry son of a bitch that did this.  We will find you.  There you go.  My God.  This war is going to be a slobber knocker.  Brad Shaw's giving Bin Laden a suplex. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, my God.  Off the top rope.  If the WWF ran their show without commercials, then I would believe.  Right.  That they were there doing it just to show.  America.  People out there, they're going.  But you know something?  I'm sure the hit of the week or whatever they call it was sponsored by Snickers or something.  So, you know, I don't know why.  I can't really put my finger on it.  But I enjoy the living crap out of listening to morons discuss these events. 
[02:06:30]  Some maniac.  I don't know what his name was.  Some guy.  Some guy.  He probably said maniac for the other two because he didn't know how to say a son of Bin Laden for the last one.  Oh, it's so friggin' good to laugh at these people.  Do we have any others?  I just want to go to Lorenzo.  Lorenzo.  Lorenzo.  Old Dirty. 
[02:07:00]  All right.  He finally hung up.  Is he calling himself Lorenzo today?  Because much like the WWF superstars, The Rock came on, but it was Dwayne Johnson.  I figured we'd call him Lorenzo today.  So maybe Lorenzo would get on and go, yo, let me tell you something, B.  Yo, B, that's my word.  All right.  What do we got over there?  Bubba Ray.  Bubba Ray.  Dudley.  Bubba Ray Dudley.  We've had him in the studio.  And let me tell you something about this guy.  He is certifiably insane.  The guy will kick your ass in the street and think about the lawsuit later. 
[02:07:30]  I'm so convinced of that.  He's a nut.  The one thing I did want to say is that there's an old saying, that which does not kill us makes us stronger.  There you go.  And yes, a lot of people died, but you can't kill America and you can't kill American spirit.  And somebody's going to pay for this.  And I hope it's soon.  That's it?  Not that thrilling. 
[02:08:00]  I like the Bradshaw speech so far.  That was a good one.  But Stephanie, just a total embarrassing abomination of a speech.  Vince, very uplifting.  Ah, Michelle.  What's going on with the phone?  Michelle?  Michelle.  Are you there?  Hello?  Hello?  Why can't we get phones going?  Hold on.  Let me try this again here.  Yeah, I'm fine.  Ah, Michelle.  No?  Gone?  Click. 
[02:08:30]  Okay.  Click.  Click.  You want to hear Kurt Angle?  Kurt Angle.  Here you go.  An American hero.  Here is a guy.  He was a legitimate wrestler in the Olympics.  Gold medal winner.  Let's hear what his views are.  I just want to say that my heart, my thoughts, and my prayers go to the victims and their  families.  You know, all my life, I've always wanted to do something special to be considered an  American hero. 
[02:09:00]  And after winning the Olympic gold medal at the Olympics, some people would consider me  to be an American hero.  But no, tell us who those heroes are.  But after watching this terrible tragedy, now I know who the true American heroes are.  Triple H.  For the police officers and the firemen and the doctors and nurses and the paramedics and  all the people that stretched out their arms to help the victims and their families, they're  the true American heroes. 
[02:09:30]  They deserve a gold medal.  Or better yet, they earn the right to be called Americans.  If I could get a big, dopey WWF championship belt to fit around all of them, I would.  It's true.  It's true.  It's true.  If only we could get a big, giant championship belt to give to all the soldiers to take over 
[02:10:00]  there and smash over the head.  I hope our soldiers are armed with folding chairs so we can slam the Afghanis and slam  them down to the desert floor.  It's true.  It's true.  Jim Norton, what's going on?  Could you guys possibly play more melodramatic clips from bigger horses' asses?  I know.  I know.  It's so horrible.  Ugh.  Really annoying.  And it's annoying me even up here in Poughkeepsie as I prepare to do bananas tonight and tomorrow. 
[02:10:30]  You whore.  Hooah.  I haven't been able to really hear the show.  Just up here we caught it a little bit.  Yeah.  Is Voss there?  Voss is outside the studio, yeah.  Oh, okay.  I was going to ask him something, but I probably won't now because he's not there.  He's actually on a break.  He donated his mouth and teeth to move away debris.  Down at the...  Oh, Voss is an idiot.  That is great. 
[02:11:00]  Norton's on the horn.  Oh.  How you doing, Voss?  What's going on, man?  Hey, you know my friend, uh, who's on the phone?  Norton?  Norton.  Jim Norton.  Where are you calling from?  Uh, Poughkeepsie.  Wow.  What brings you up there?  Oh, you know what's funny is I don't want to plug bananas tonight, tomorrow.  You guys are just awful.  Huh?  You guys are just awful.  Voss, are you hitting on the interns again?  No.  Who said I was?  You aren't?  A little bit.  We have two.  You are.  Oh, you are.  The only interns we have now are two attractive girls. 
[02:11:30]  I'm just talking.  He's on the couch outside, flanked by the interns.  I'm just talking.  Hi, sweetie.  I know the struggle.  I talk.  I have a car.  You want to draw your door?  Oh, man.  Hey, Norton.  Yeah.  Remember I told you my dilemma about work this weekend and what I did?  Yeah.  Well, what I did take got canceled.  Okay.  I am such a zero.  All right.  Good.  Nice inside code word jokes that you got working there, guys.  Well, that's good.  Should we tell the other six million people that are listening a little more inside stuff?  We could have talked about that later, you retard. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, you know what?  There is no reason to bring that up now on live radio.  My friend called me, Matt, today.  When they were doing the cathedral thing, did you see the ceremony this morning?  Yeah.  Yeah.  My friend Matt called me and said, as they were playing the organ, they should have been  dropping bombs in Afghanistan, like the Godfather.  Right.  Oh, good.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Michael Corleone was in church.  Yeah.  Godfather III, right?  Yeah.  No, two.  The baptism.  It was.  No, that was.  It was one.  One.  That was the first one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Was it?  Then they were baptizing his son. 
[02:12:30]  Uh-huh.  And all hell was breaking loose.  Oh, yeah.  As they killed all the heads of the five families.  And they would go back to the organ.  And they would go shooting them up in the room.  Or something.  That would be great today.  Oh, that is good.  Hey, Voss, you have a never again tattoo.  Did you realize that the Jews were exterminated by some maniac?  As far as Bradshaw is concerned from the WWF.  What a moron.  He's outraged.  You know, we've seen disaster before.  Bradshaw, when Jews were exterminated by some maniac. 
[02:13:00]  The name slips my mind.  I'm not a history major.  Bradshaw.  Complete idiot.  All right, Jim.  We're going to let you go.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  Thank you.  There he goes.  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Let's go to Joe.  He's been at ground zero for 18 hours.  Joe, what's going on?  What's going on, Hope?  What's going on, Anthony?  Hey, man.  Man, it's brutal down there.  Yeah.  I'm with a local union that works in the city.  And my dad was the foreman when that building went up.  And I've worked.  And I put my five-year apprenticeship in in that building. 
[02:13:30]  Wow.  And my local called us out.  We've been down there working a whole crew of guys.  As long as you can stay, you can keep going.  But what you see down there is just gruesome.  Yeah.  What are you seeing?  You're seeing a lot of body parts come out.  You're seeing, you know, when you find a human, you scream and yell.  And they send up a dog.  And the cadaver dog smells.  And then they send up a doctor.  And they determine if he's alive or not.  And you just hold your breath.  And you're waiting here.  If he's alive, everybody cheers. 
[02:14:00]  And the next thing you hear, if he's not, is everybody screams out, body bag.  And they pass him up the line.  Right.  And it's gruesome.  It truly is gruesome.  You know, to see something that took six years to build fall inside of two hours.  And all those people down there.  But I've got to give my hat.  My hat's off to my guys.  But my hat's really off to the firemen and the police department.  There you go.  Because those guys are busting their hump, man.  You've got guys from all over the world busting their hump. 
[02:14:30]  But I just want to let you guys know.  And I heard just yesterday.  And how you guys want to get down to ground zero.  Yeah.  No, you don't.  I never said I did.  There's no way in hell I would want to go down there.  Opie, for some reason, would like to.  Opie, believe me, when I walked down there, I was down there Tuesday afternoon.  When I walked down there, my stomach fell out of my ass.  Yeah.  You know, it's just, it takes my breath away.  I can't explain it.  But for some reason, I've got to see it.  Well.  I just got to see it.  You still got your union book? 
[02:15:00]  I'm not.  That was me.  No, that was me.  Well, steal his.  Yeah.  Construction helmet, a pair of gloves.  You guys are more than welcome to come down and dig, man.  No, that's fine.  Thank you.  You know, it's, but my hat goes off to everybody down there, and for the families, we're trying  as hard as we can.  You know, there's going to be survivors.  You think so?  Yes, I do.  I've been in that building for so many years, and I know how deep.  That building goes down five stories of just parking lots, and that's the strongest part  of the building.  But, I mean, how long can these people survive without water and food? 
[02:15:30]  Well, they say the human body can go a week to ten days.  Yeah.  You know, and down in that, at that time of the morning, there's tons of deliveries  down there for the restaurants and the food courts.  Oh.  So, if that, if it's not totally damaged, they could probably get food and water out  of some of the trucks.  That would be nice to think.  But, you know what, I'm going back tomorrow morning, and I'll do another 12-hour, 18-hour  shift.  Are they, are they anywhere as close to the basement, or figuring out how to get in the  basement? 
[02:16:00]  Dude, we haven't finished cleaning off the sidewalk yet.  No, I understand that.  We haven't found, we, we're still probably 15 to 20 feet from the building.  The rubble is four stories high in the center.  And you just can't, you know, of course, you can't start picking at the center.  Right.  You got to go from the outside in.  But, I was one of the guys on the crew yesterday when we pulled out that one live fireman from  the top of the pile.  And I'll tell you what, it brought the power out of everybody.  And it made morale so high that I could have kept going for another three days. 
[02:16:30]  You know, it's just, it's tough to explain.  You know, because you go five or six hours, and all you do is pull out body parts and dead  people.  And then, you pull out someone alive.  Well, when was the last time you guys pulled out anyone alive?  Oh, it was yesterday.  Really?  Yes.  It was a fireman that was down there who fell through a hole and got trapped.  So, one of the rescuers, right?  Yes.  Yeah, okay.  And we didn't know he fell through a hole. 
[02:17:00]  They had no contact with him.  What they do is they actually cut a cadaver dog loose.  And the dog runs through the pile.  And where the dog starts to dig is where we start to dig frantically.  Yeah.  Because that means he got a scent.  And the dog can't determine if the person's alive or deceased.  Did you write all your info on your arm?  I saw that on TV last night.  No, I don't do that.  A lot of the rescuers are writing their name, their phone number, their social security number.  Because they don't know if they're going to be the next victim.  Well, I've got a wallet in my pocket with that. 
[02:17:30]  And the fire department, once we find someone, we have the intelligence.  We step back.  They're trained for this.  We're not.  Yeah.  We're basically just hands and shovels.  Now, what do you guys need down there, Joe?  You need work gloves, safety glasses.  The surgical mask, right?  What they really need is respirators.  Respirators?  The surgical paper mask does nothing.  Yeah.  I mean, the dust is so intense.  When you get up into the pile, you know, you have to have a respirator.  Right.  You know, I don't mean a gas mask or anything like that. 
[02:18:00]  Just a two-filter standard respirator.  But it's crazy down there.  I mean, the food and the water just keeps coming.  You know, there's people walking around with cases of water.  You know, who needs the water?  Who needs the water?  It's just there.  Right.  I mean, you have all that support.  What they need is more tradesmen to step up, someone who can operate a cutting torch to  cut some of the steel away.  You know, one of the local gas companies, the construction gas companies donated all  the bottles of oxygen and acetylene for cutting.  We have no cutting rigs. 
[02:18:30]  We have no torches.  We have no regulators.  No hose.  So if you find someone, you've got to run a regulator across the whole thing to get  and then hook it up.  Right.  They need more regulators and hoses.  And where do they drop this stuff off?  Javits Center?  Oh, I would imagine so.  I'm not totally sure.  Yeah.  You know, I really don't know.  But as far as what we need, the guys that are out there pulling stuff out is gloves.  Right.  Dry socks.  Right.  Rain gear.  Okay.  You know, stuff like that.  But it's extra construction helmets because a lot of people that come down don't have  their own helmet. 
[02:19:00]  Right.  You know, and they want to get in, but they don't have helmets.  And you're not allowed in the area without a hard hat on.  But it's trying.  And I just wanted to see if I can, you know, lighten, you know, all listeners that listen  to your station because I'm a faithful listener to what's actually going on down there.  Now, what's the deal with the buildings around there?  I mean, are they going to collapse?  There's two that they say are threatening to collapse.  And what?  All of a sudden a siren goes off, which basically means run as fast as you can?  Basically, the way the system is, the fire department tells you, each group, when you're 
[02:19:30]  there, if you hear the fire trucks honk their horns, you drop what you're doing and you run  like hell, my friend.  Yeah, because one of our cop friends called me last night.  We relayed this story earlier.  And I answered the phone and it's Keith, Keith the cop.  Right.  Running as fast as he can, pretty much, you can hear the fear in his voice going, dude,  they just, you know, hit the siren.  Yeah, they hit the horns.  We're running like crazy. 
[02:20:00]  Can you please turn on the TV and tell me which building they're saying has fallen down  because we have no idea.  And they were just running, hoping they're running away from the building.  Okay, the two buildings that are shaky right now.  The Millennium and what?  Right, and One Liberty Plaza.  Liberty Plaza, right.  Okay, and it's, they're very shaky.  The first night, Tuesday afternoon I was there, One Liberty Plaza flexed five degrees.  You know, five degrees doesn't sound like much, but when you've got a 54-story building flexing  five degrees at the top, that's a lot. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  You know, and we did that three times Tuesday.  They sounded the horns.  And we ran, we run from, from the Trade Center itself down to the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel.  Right.  As fast as you can.  Now, you think that building's coming down?  I, I don't know if it's going to fall by itself.  Right.  But I would say.  Oh, either way it's got to come down.  I would say 50 to 60 buildings around the Trade Center are going to have to be torn down.  50 or 60?  Yes.  There are buildings 10 blocks away with chunks of steel that hang through, through the concrete. 
[02:21:00]  Oh.  I mean, this was, this is huge.  Well, yeah, we know that.  When this thing came down, it, you know, we're just very lucky it imploded and it didn't go to the sides.  Right.  You know?  Can you imagine?  That's why I'm saying, to see it, I have photos of it.  Right.  And what I'm going to try and do, I'm going to be down there all day tomorrow.  I'm going to try and drop these photos off, a copy of them at your office.  Yeah.  On Monday.  Okay.  Okay?  I mean, they're good photos, but most of them are the buildings that are surrounding. 
[02:21:30]  I mean, there's buildings with holes in them you could drive a truck through.  Wow.  I mean, there's no possible way that these buildings can be repaired.  Wow.  They're totally structurally unsafe.  Right.  You know?  But like I said, to see Ground Zero and be there and work in it, it takes the life out of me.  I'm a single father.  I've been paying a babysitter for 18 hours.  Wow.  Just so I can be down there and just do, you know, and help.  Right.  No matter what it is.  I mean, in 18 hours, if I took an hour and a half of breaks, it was a lot. 
[02:22:00]  Hmm.  You know, you just keep going.  Are you going back down?  I'm going back down tomorrow morning at 530.  Right on, bro.  Me and probably 150 of my union brothers.  Right on, man.  There you go.  You know, we're in there just trying to help.  Cool.  But keep the faith, man.  We're going to keep pulling live ones out of there.  All right, Joe.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Thanks for sharing today.  Not a problem, brother.  Love you.  All right.  Bye.  There goes Joe.  Oh, Mike.  Mike, how you doing, man?  Hey, how's it going?  Hi.  Hey, I just want to commend you guys.  You guys have been the voice of New York, of an angry New York, since the beginning of 
[02:22:30]  this.  Yeah.  You guys are doing a hell of a job.  And, you know, it's actually, I've never looked at New York.  I live in New Jersey.  And I've never really had that great of an opinion of New York, just because of the New  York attitude.  Not to say that I didn't like, but you know what?  You guys have won me over.  I'm highly impressed by the people in the city.  And you guys will come back. 
[02:23:00]  But I want to get to a couple of things.  Okay.  I had two ideas.  Yeah.  All right.  First idea is to, when eventually the World Trade Center gets built back up, those two  towers should be two middle fingers sticking at the Middle East.  Well, yeah.  The first thing.  Well, we've seen those photos already.  Yeah.  They're already sending photos around.  Okay.  The second thing is, hearing you guys talk about wrestling before, it's the first time I've  laughed all week.  And I've heard that Mick Foley challenged Osama bin Laden to hell in a cell. 
[02:23:30]  Is there a, no, there's not a Mick Foley.  I want to get, I want to get the Lita, the Chris Jericho speech, the Ivory speech, because  I know she doesn't have a brain in her head.  But, um, what's the other one that I was looking for?  Uh, Devon Dudley.  Farouk.  What could Farouk say?  Farouk.  Oh, jeez.  Devon Dudley.  Hear my brothers!  I know.  Just the fire! 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, that's what I want to say.  So we, we got to get a few more of these, uh, done so we can, we can play them.  Because it, it really is the first thing that's really made me laugh hard since, uh, Tuesday.  All right, Mike.  Double, double, double Ray's kind of disappointing, though.  Hearing the great speeches he used to give in ECW.  Yeah.  And hearing him not say much was kind of disappointing.  Well, they're toning it down and being themselves.  Yeah, they're being themselves.  That's the mistake I think they're making.  Yeah.  It's the funniest part because they don't have brains in their head, these people.  They're there because of their physical ability. 
[02:24:30]  And when they have to be themselves and go off script, it is a scream.  Like someone wrote, they go, I can only imagine, uh, Vince McMahon's face when Stephanie gave  that speech just rolling his eyes and go, okay, no more without a script.  You know, he just, she's out of her mind.  He just got his head, he's banging his head against the desk going, why, Stephanie?  Why?  It seemed like a great idea.  All right, Mike.  All right, talk to you later.  Thank you.  Bye. 
[02:25:00]  Bye.  Are we getting the other ones?  Sean, what's going on?  You're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yo.  Hey, Sean, what's up?  Yo, guys, listen.  You guys are doing a great thing.  Seriously.  I'm really lucky in listening to 94 and down here in Philly.  And they're doing a great thing by now playing music.  You know, some of the stations down here, they just don't get it, right?  They're just playing, like, you know, music.  They're playing, like, Nirvana and Aerosmith now.  It's like, what's going on here?  Are you guys forgetting what happened?  You know, at least wait until Monday and then, you know, try to go back to some normal programming. 
[02:25:30]  But I think a lot of people had a lot to say.  And, you know, we can't just do it all on our show or on the other shows here on NEW.  I think a lot of the other stations should have taken a little time.  Even if they want to play some music and then come back and let some people talk, I think that would be a good thing.  Exactly.  Yeah, we don't have everyone in New York listening to us, you know.  And we've been doing this for four days.  And the email coming in every day, it's – I can't even get to all of it. 
[02:26:00]  We're trying.  And it's a bunch of people going, I wanted to get through and I couldn't.  So I'm just going to write my thoughts down, you know.  There's so many people that need to talk about this.  They need to react to this.  They need to, you know, just express what they're feeling.  And it's too bad that a bunch of stations – I can't talk for the other cities.  I don't have the vibe in the other cities.  But I can tell you, you know, New York City, three miles away to our right, is a disaster that no one has been able to, you know, fully explain. 
[02:26:30]  And these people need to talk.  And they chose not to go with it.  Exactly.  But, see, I'm 20 years old.  I'm an Army Reservist.  Right now I am spewing patriotism.  I have – on my car I have an American flag on my antenna.  On my driver's side I got – in white shoe polish I put, democracy will not perish.  On the back I put, don't tread on me.  And on the passenger side it says –  Sosa 72. 
[02:27:00]  No, no Sosa on your car?  Yeah, I just put that on there with some white shoe polish.  But I want to thank you guys because you guys are providing a little bit of comic relief for, you know, a lot of this tragedy.  A lot of us are going through a lot.  You know, everybody's going through a lot.  But you guys are providing a little comic relief.  You know, yesterday you guys were making fun of Stephanie McMahon's boobs.  And today you guys are making fun of the WWF and their comments.  I'm laughing.  I'm just – this is hilarious, you know.  It's pretty effed up right here because you go from someone telling a really, you know, emotional story or whatever, 
[02:27:30]  and then the next call you're laughing.  It's just really weird.  Yeah.  A little while ago you guys had a woman on who did a poem involving little numbers.  Yeah.  I want to kind of elaborate on that, if you'd let me a little bit.  All right.  Go ahead.  Okay.  One country in mourning, two towers destroyed.  Three targets hit, four planes used.  Now here's where it gets better.  Five branches of service ready to kick your ass.  Six times four hours a day you'll be crying for your mama. 
[02:28:00]  Seven days a week America will triumph.  8.45 is when it began.  9 a.m. will not be forgotten.  Ten times ten times the damage you caused.  It's my little poem here.  Bravo.  Kick-ass.  You know Walt Whitman, but okay.  You're not Bradshaw.  He's getting my ass.  Did better than Bradshaw, sure.  That guy.  Some dude guy.  Some maniac.  Some maniac.  That guy over there. 
[02:28:30]  I think it was the responsibility of some maniac.  Mom Lee Joe and what's his name?  They're maniacs, not.  All right, Sean.  Thanks, guys.  Bye.  Too much.  What is Pat?  Patty.  Yes.  Hi.  Hi, how are you?  How are you?  Okay.  How are you?  Well, I wanted to come down and hang out to be part of the family for a little while myself,  so I came by.  Oh, brother.  You're upstairs?  Right now, yeah. 
[02:29:00]  Where were you when this went down there, Patty?  I was at work.  We had to calm down a couple of employees who had relatives there.  One of them, her husband, was in the building.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  And then another one, her sister, was missing, and they couldn't find her for over 30 hours.  They just found her late last night.  She was in the hospital.  She had stitches on her head.  Well, about that.  So you were working at McDonald's?  Yeah.  And then I've been staying in the city for the last couple of days. 
[02:29:30]  I found a place to stay from a list that Virginia gave me.  So, uh...  Why?  You don't want to go home, or...?  Well, I couldn't get home yesterday, and today the transportation's going to be sketchy.  Why couldn't you go home yesterday, Patty?  Because they closed Staten Island because of some scare.  Yeah, okay.  So, anyway...  I was talking Patty out.  That's the scare.  That's the scare, Patty.  Oh, I'm just scared.  So, anyway, I thought I would come be part of the family, at least for a little while,  before I go to where I'm going tonight. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, we canceled the, um...  The, uh, family...  The O&A family get together.  ...get together today.  Yeah, yeah.  I just wanted to be with people.  I've been kind of, like, isolated from friends.  I can see...  You want to be with people?  You want to be with people?  What?  You don't want to be with your own kind?  Right.  Whatever that is.  The aliens?  No, I wanted to hang with you guys.  I feel I'm part of the O&A family, too.  With everybody else.  Much like...  Let me explain.  Much like when an anthill gets knocked over. 
[02:30:30]  You know me.  I have the body of an ant.  When an anthill gets knocked over, we get outraged.  But what do we do?  We rebuild our anthill.  Doesn't matter if you kick it.  Sure, the little ants scurry about and lose their way on the trail.  But before you know it, I'm right there up front with a big rock in my mandibles.  Building the anthill over again.  Just like you humans will build New York back again. 
[02:31:00]  All right.  I just hope a bunch of larvae didn't get hurt in the anthill.  All right.  You know, I got a question for Stalker Patty.  All right.  How does she handle it when people spray her with Raid?  No.  Oh, sorry.  This building is very secure right now.  You don't work in the building.  You need a building ID to get in.  Steve can't even get upstairs.  We've all been questioned.  I had to call someone when I went for lunch today.  Patty, how did you get in our building today? 
[02:31:30]  I snuck by underneath a crumb from a piece of crumb cake.  No, I just went to the lady behind the desk and told her my name.  May I go to the 10th floor?  I wanted to ask her to come down to the studio.  They scurried under a piece of lollipop.  Get Nancy's phone number from Virginia.  So she called up and talked to Virginia.  And then the security guard didn't ask for my ID because he knows me.  So he let me in after the lady said it was okay. 
[02:32:00]  There you go.  Oh, you're good.  I got in the elevator.  Somebody left a straw across the chasm that is the front of an elevator for me.  Really?  You're real funny.  Real funny.  Well, I just felt like seeing people, too, and saying hello and mingling with everybody.  I felt like knocking my antennas together with another rant and communicating.  That's how we do it.  We rub our antennas together and go, okay, follow me.  And everyone follows. 
[02:32:30]  We pick up a grain of sand at a time, and it don't seem like much.  But before you know it, we've got a big hole in the ground to live in.  You're funny.  Very funny.  Look at my thorax.  Well, anyway, may I come down and say hi to everybody?  No.  Please?  You have to stay up top with the workers.  Only the queen can come down into the...  Why can't I come down? 
[02:33:00]  Stay up top and just, you know, clean the area outside the hole.  Keep it clear.  Protect us from any huge wasps that might want to fly into the ant hole.  Oh, stop it.  Stop it.  Uh-oh.  Here comes the termite, our mortal enemy.  Anthony, I've got an announcement to make.  It's 536, and we're going back to our normal show today.  We don't have to be nice to people.  I kind of like this.  Paddy, come on. 
[02:33:30]  Right?  I don't know.  I can't...  People are...  I know what they're saying in their cars.  Don't do it, but...  Don't do it.  Paddy, come on.  Can't you just...  What?  What is the problem?  What are you going to do if you come down here?  Well, I guess hang out.  I know everybody's down there.  I'll share my sugar cube with you. 
[02:34:00]  How about you stop by Monday?  Okay.  Is that...  You really mean that?  No.  That was called the blow-off, right?  Yeah.  It's just that everybody else came down, so, you know, I'm a friend, too.  Oh.  You know, besides, I've been kind of like on my own for the last couple of days.  I thought it would be good for me. 
[02:34:30]  It's exactly like a bug's life.  I've been on my own, walking around.  You know, we could avoid some of these disasters if these damn kids wouldn't hold the magnifying glass over the ant holes.  Look, I thought I went far, but it's just the garbage can in the middle of Central Park.  Seemed like I went miles.  It was just five feet.  But for me, that's a long walk.  Patty, come on. 
[02:35:00]  You're going to be all right?  Yeah, I think I'll be fine, yeah.  I think I'll be fine.  Yeah.  I just wanted to have a little bit of joviality for a couple of whatever.  Joviality.  Could you just put a slightly moistened M&M in front of me, and I'll be happy for about a month.  That's good.  I just wanted a little westernality.  Yeah, besides, it's good to see people.  With my big compound eyes, even one person's like seeing a thousand. 
[02:35:30]  That's true.  The compound eyes are made of a thousand eyes, Anthony.  You're right.  Patty, you're a stalker.  I think...  I think...  I'm a stalker.  I'm a friend.  I'm not a stalker.  No, Patty, the whole reason you're part of our show is because you're a stalker.  How did it become...  Where did I miss something where you went from stalker, Patty, to friend, Patty? 
[02:36:00]  Friend of the show, Patty.  I am a friend of the show.  I don't care how much you do for our show.  I still consider you, not a friend, a stalker.  In your warped mind, when did we go from...  You're stalking me to being a friend of mine.  I need to hear this.  I'm a friend.  Watch out, I could lift a thousand times my own body weight.  You're still a stalker, Patty. 
[02:36:30]  That's, well, it might be a character type thing.  Yeah, we're a character.  Ben, what do you suggest, Ben?  I can see.  Steve put the headphone, the ear things on the headphones over his eyes.  He looks like a big ant.  Yes.  People of Earth.  A giant ant.  Ben, what do you think?  Do you really want to do this to the poor people that have come here? 
[02:37:00]  It was bad enough seeing her the other day when we came into work.  Remember that the other day?  Yeah.  I wasn't even going to bring it up.  Just want to make sure you're okay.  Without that, I was on my break.  Oh, yeah.  There's always a reason why you're in front of...  Just right in front of the building.  Right as we come to work every day.  I have lots of friends out there.  I don't see them every day in front of the building.  I'm sorry.  You don't see me every day.  I take a break at different times in the morning.  Patty, that's because we're on to you.  We all go into the building different ways now to avoid you.  Patty, that's what the detective told me to do, to change up my pattern. 
[02:37:30]  Change your pattern.  Oh, don't be silly.  I'm not a dangerous person.  Sometimes they fly me in and then drop me off on the roof.  I got some advice from a detective.  That's what he says.  You mix up your routine.  That's why I don't see you in me every day.  I guarantee you see someone from the show every day.  Not really, no.  Actually, I see nobody.  But Patty, when did we go from, you know, like stalker pals to friends? 
[02:38:00]  You're not supposed to anger them, Opie.  I've always been a friend of the show.  I've supported the show for three years.  How does it make you a friend?  All right, listen.  You know, I feel that I support everybody there.  You know, I feel I'm a friend.  Did you bring cards today?  Cards?  What do you mean by cards?  Did you bring cards or little letters today?  Did you make anything?  No.  Did you make anything?  Any commemorative things that you made? 
[02:38:30]  No.  How are you going to get down here?  Crawl all the way down the ant farm to the bottom?  She's upstairs.  She got through our security downstairs.  I don't know.  No one else can.  I think she crawled up the side of the building.  Remember the ant farms you used to fill them up with dirt?  And then the glass sides, and you'd see the ants going about their business.  Just see Patty showering and then going to work.  See me showering? 
[02:39:00]  It's a Patty farm.  Oh, no.  No.  All right.  Well, um...  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Patty, how does your abdomen stay connected to your thorax with just that little thread  of whatever that is that ants have in between it?  It's like nothing there.  How do you get a belt?  My waist isn't that small.  It's not a waist.  There's a name for it.  A thorax? 
[02:39:30]  It's that little thing, that little whisker in between the thorax and the abdomen that I  don't know how you even hold your pants up.  I don't know.  I guess I use spring and tie it.  Yeah.  All right, Patty.  I vote no.  No.  No.  It's just too much to deal with today.  But she's hurting, everyone.  Yeah.  She's hurting. 
[02:40:00]  Everybody hurts.  Oh, Patty, just hold on the line.  You wuss.  I'm just saying hold on the line.  He does this.  This was just like at the Hooters thing.  He does this.  He invites people down because he doesn't have to deal with them.  They have to sit out there and bother and Lynch and everyone else out there.  Then he goes, Rick, why don't you go tell him to leave?  Mark, what's going on?  Hey, I just got home.  I was listening to you guys coming home.  Yeah.  And I turned the TV on, and they got Chuck Schumer on the TV again. 
[02:40:30]  And all he keeps talking about is the money and what, you know, that they're going to  build New York bigger and better.  It seems like Chuck Schumer doesn't really give a crap about the people that are involved  and that are hurting or suffering from this.  How were you able to understand Chuck Schumer when his head is buried so far up Hillary Clinton's  ass that it usually muffles whatever he says?  He is like her little lap dog.  Yeah.  You ever see this guy?  He is always with Hillary like her little lap dog. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah, well, that's it.  Every time, oh, we have Hillary Clinton on the line.  Oh, and here's Chuck Schumer.  Chuck Schumer is always there when Hillary is there.  She stops short.  He goes right up her ass.  Yep.  Mark, I'm not digging Chuck Schumer through this whole crisis.  And talked about leaders yesterday and how leaders are not born.  They're made from a crisis.  From situations like this.  And, you know, Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton proven they're no real leaders. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  They're no real leaders.  I mean, you're talking.  They should be ashamed of themselves.  I hear Hillary Clinton was uptown looking for the World Trade Center.  It makes me so mad that they're taking our tax money and then they call themselves leaders  and all they're worried about is the dollar here.  Let's worry about the human lives that are involved.  Yeah.  And the people that are risking their lives on the line and everything else, you know?  Yeah, the money will come in later.  Believe me.  Let's worry about that down the line.  Let's worry about cleaning up this mess and trying to find the people that might be alive. 
[02:42:00]  All right.  Right on, man.  All right.  Take care, guys.  Thanks, Mark.  Bye.  So Chuck Schumer has not impressed me one bit through this whole thing.  No.  Sarah, what's going on?  Hi, guys.  How are you doing?  Pretty good.  Good.  We want to, you know, first of all, thank you for what you've been doing.  And this is just one of the most horrific messes that we've ever seen.  Yeah.  But I feel like there are just two things, honestly, that are getting us through it.  Number one, it's knowing that the fire department and the police department and everyone else  that's working so hard.  Well, there's a lot of, you know, definitely that needs to be said, but there's a lot of 
[02:42:30]  just regular folks down there.  That's it.  Yeah, 100%.  Let's not forget about the medical people, the union workers, just the average schmo that was  able to get in there.  That's it.  I'm an eye doctor and I kept calling all their places and asking them if they need, like,  eye doctors to help, you know, just, like, wash out eyes, whatever the heck they needed.  Yeah.  And they're like, no, we have too many people.  But what I just wanted to say was the only other comforting thing I see is every time  Rudy Giuliani gets on television or says something, I'm just like, thank God he's there. 
[02:43:00]  He's in control.  Well, he's in control and that's, like, what we need.  And as you guys were just saying before about Hillary and Chuck, you know, like, give me  a break.  They don't know what's flying.  He just steps up to the plate and he swings.  And it's natural.  He's not flying.  The guy, first of all, the guy is, he's leaving office and he can't run for mayor again.  So he's not doing this.  There's no political motive.  There's no ulterior motive.  Exactly.  The guy is a legitimate leader. 
[02:43:30]  He has come forward.  And I am not a big fan of Giuliani.  We've had our differences.  I think his whole moral issue and what we should or shouldn't do is see.  You know, that doesn't factor in here.  Exactly.  Exactly.  But when it comes, push comes to shove and he's got to show his leadership, he's right  there.  It's amazing.  That's it.  That's it.  I don't know.  They should write some kind of new law and let him, like, stay.  And can you imagine if you really would have...  Slow down.  They've been saying that on TV, though.  I think they should.  Until this whole thing kind of, you know, clears up a little bit. 
[02:44:00]  That's it.  Let him stay.  And can you imagine if he really would have won...  You know, we had to move out of New York to New Jersey and I kept my New York license  and everything else just so I could vote for him against, you know, Hillary.  And it turns out it was whatever it was.  But I agree.  I think they should write something, you know, new and just let him stay.  I mean, he's the man.  And that's it.  Listen, you guys are doing a great job.  Thank you.  And God bless everyone and keep up the good work.  All right.  All right.  Take care.  Security for the building wants to talk to Rick now. 
[02:44:30]  Go see what they want.  They're probably pissed off that Patty got through their security for us downstairs.  What?  I curled through a straw.  They never saw me.  What's up?  What's up?  Go ahead, man.  There's people downstairs trying to get in.  You know, everyone else can't get in, but Patty got in.  That's all.  Yeah, Patty can get in.  I think Drew Boogie's down there.  It just cracks me up.  I've worked here for four years, and they're busting my chops downstairs coming in.  But yeah, Patty can walk right in.  I love it myself down the skylight on cables. 
[02:45:00]  Like Tom Cruise.  Medical marijuana Barbie.  How'd she get in?  Bring her in for one minute.  She annoys the hell out of me on a regular day.  Come on in.  Let's see.  Come here, medical.  She's giving me that look like, ooh.  Medical marijuana Barbie.  I'm yawning already.  Where is she?  Ah, there you are.  Grab a mic.  Hello.  How are you?  Just fine.  Are you stoned today? 
[02:45:30]  Not today.  I'm working.  Hard to get the weed?  What do you got?  Well, I just wanted to thank you guys for your great shows that you've been doing this week,  and it's helped me in listening to everyone else's experience.  And people have been talking about, you know, it's eventually one day it's going to be time to get back to work.  And this is what I do.  Focus on what?  Medical marijuana.  Yeah, but medical marijuana Barbie.  Thank you.  Medical marijuana Barbie, everyone.  Do you understand that maybe right now isn't the time? 
[02:46:00]  Maybe it's time to put your cause aside for maybe even until Monday.  Just, I got one question.  But I, you know, I'm a New Yorker too, so.  If you're not stoned, why would you leave the house with pink hair?  You're here to talk about medical marijuana?  No, I'm here to talk about.  No, you started talking about medical marijuana.  Well, there, I do believe that there is a connection because.  All right, thank you.  Rick, get medical marijuana Barbie out of here. 
[02:46:30]  Very good.  Another great appearance by medical marijuana Barbie.  Maybe another time would be a more appropriate medical marijuana Barbie.  Hey, your mic's not on anymore, so you can babble to yourself.  Giuliani last year didn't like medical marijuana.  And there she goes.  Medical marijuana Barbie.  Thank you so much for coming in during this time of crisis.  Thanks for coming in and helping us through this trying time by pushing your cause, you bitch. 
[02:47:00]  How the hell does that happen?  Jesus.  I knew it was coming, too.  I knew it.  That's worse than.  I'm a New Yorker.  Norton plugging.  And you guys got me through the last few days.  And, well, we're going to move on with our lives.  And, you know, I know eventually we're going to have to move on.  And I'm here for medical marijuana.  She has a coloring book.  She's plugging a coloring book.  She's what?  She's got a coloring book out there.  A medical marijuana.  Marijuana coloring book.  That's good.  Didn't we have our pot break already today with Psycho Mark? 
[02:47:30]  It sounded more stoned than anything.  Oh, look at that.  Jesus Christ.  He wants to show me a picture of his kids on top of the World Trade Center there.  There it is.  What a view.  Look at that.  Gonzo.  She's got a whole box of coloring books.  Oh, man.  I want to see one of these coloring books.  Give me the box of coloring books.  Say we'll give them away.  Say we'll give them away.  She's walking down the hall.  Quickly, go get Barbie. 
[02:48:00]  No, no, no.  You get, just get the box of coloring books.  We don't need her back here.  Yeah.  Get the box.  Who plugs her cores now?  Yeah, right now.  That's like me saying, hey, you can get my CD on RedForce.com.  That would be so dumb.  You're a despicable man, too.  Michael, what's going on?  Hey, O'Day.  How are you?  Good.  Listen, I've been very depressed about this whole scenario.  I even lost a friend or whatever.  But, Anthony, with the whole patty thing, you pulled me right out of it, man. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah.  You did it in a classy way, too.  The whole sugar cube.  I'm just tired of being, like, so bummed.  It was nice to laugh for a couple of minutes.  Exactly.  You know, I'd abuse Voss, too, but I'm not really in the mood to do it.  There you go.  All right, guys.  All right, Mike.  Thanks a lot, Anthony.  I appreciate it.  No problem.  All right, buddy.  What are those?  The medical marijuana.  The medical marijuana Barbie coloring book. 
[02:49:00]  What?  Making a comeback.  Yeah, we're making a comeback.  What is this?  They're bad pictures, bad drawings that you're supposed to color.  Wow, look at that.  You could color in a pot leaf.  I know.  That takes an imagination.  So dumb.  Patty, what's up?  Hi.  Not so much.  Here you go.  Look at, look at, look at, look at, look at.  With all that's going on right now, this is necessary? 
[02:49:30]  A bashing of the NYPD, pretty much, in her little coloring book.  Look at this.  Medical marijuana Barbie shock and surprise.  Some mean people came and beat up her new friends and took the medical marijuana patients to jail.  And they show cops maybe arresting somebody in a drawing with NYPD right across his chest.  And she refers to them as some bad people. 
[02:50:00]  And it's not a gentle arrest.  You friggin' twat.  Patty.  Bad people.  Hi.  Oh, I just saw medical marijuana Barbie go by me and down the elevator.  She looked a little upset.  Well, why don't you go talk to her, Patty?  No, she's gone.  Oh, that's good.  Why don't you go follow her downstairs?  Make sure she's okay.  I'm sure she's fine.  I just thought I would just come by and hang for a couple hours and cheer up a little bit.  That's all.  Oh, my God.  I said yesterday, and, you know, that's the only reason why I'm here. 
[02:50:30]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  What?  Our new president thinks medical marijuana should be regulated by the individual states.  Do you agree with him?  Ask our new president about medical marijuana.  They got a drawing of George W. Bush.  Look at his pupils.  Look at his pupils.  They're swastikas.  Give me the whole box.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And this is the time to come in here and do this, this, this bitch. 
[02:51:00]  Every one of them gets ripped up.  Throw these in the streets of New York or something.  No, rip every single one of them up.  There's hundreds of them.  Who cares?  All right, hand them out.  Rip every single one of them up.  There's actually thousands of them.  There's got to be a thousand of them.  Let's burn the books.  There's thousands of these.  No, this is, this is propaganda.  Look at this.  Page eight, she says, they're bigger than the Beatles. 
[02:51:30]  Good.  I hope, I hope a lot of, uh, if you go open.  I hope a lot of money of their resources went into, uh, printing this trash and, uh, by,  by just ripping them up and destroying it, it wastes a lot of their money.  What a bitch, man.  She, it, it slams the cops and has, uh, the president as some kind of Nazi.  That's, that's a wonderful thing to try to be pushing right now. 
[02:52:00]  Despicable human.  Stupid friggin' bitch.  She's insane.  You know, no, no, no, uh, nothing against pot.  I mean, if anyone wants to smoke weed, more power to you.  I could give a flying F.  But to, to then turn it into some twisted political argument where this, this pink-haired,  no-brained bitch comes in here and starts spreading her trash. 
[02:52:30]  Well, out of time like this, especially.  Wasn't she a little old for that cause, too?  She's a little old for the pink hair and that outfit.  You know, that might have looked cute when she was, uh, in her twenties or thirties.  All right.  Pedro, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, guys.  How you doing today?  All right.  I'm feeling a lot better than I did the last time we talked.  Yeah?  Yep.  Uh, just hoping that you guys know, uh, cops down there, firemen are doing a really great  job.  The construction workers are busting their asses. 
[02:53:00]  Uh, Lisa Orban knows, um, the bar I work at.  And we just want to, all the guys, when they're done, come down to Donnie's, spend some time  there, hang out, just relax, we'll take care of you.  All right.  And I'm a little distracted because there are hundreds upon hundreds of coloring books  being ripped up in front of my eyes.  These medical marijuana, uh, coloring books.  Hey, guys.  Badmouth the president and the cops, uh, that have, you know, the police officers in this 
[02:53:30]  city, they're heroes.  Nice.  They're heroes.  They are doing things that are above and beyond the call of, of any duty.  And this bitch is trying to come on our airwaves so she could spread her crap and give out  these, uh, this propaganda is beyond me.  It's beyond me.  Now, I don't advocate violence.  I never have, uh, to civilians or, uh, to Americans, no matter how stupid they, they might  be.  But if you see this pink haired twat, just yell, yell at her face, just yell at her and 
[02:54:00]  go, what, what's your effing problem?  Ugh, what a creep.  Ugh.  Hey, guys, you still have fun with Patty over there?  Huh?  Sure is hard to rip up magazines with one hand, uh, full of, holding a beer, ain't it, Lynch?  Thanks for helping us out, Lynchie.  What'd you say, Pedro?  We're just keeping the economy going by drinking more beer.  I, I, I applaud him.  What's up, Pedro?  If you guys still have issues with Patty, let me know. 
[02:54:30]  I'll send you a couple of MPs to take care of her.  All right.  No, no.  All right.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Uh, Stalker Patty.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  MPs to take care of me.  Well, you're, you're still upstairs, right?  Yeah.  But I'm not a harmful person.  I'm not a harmful person.  Only when we swarm.  You ever see us in Africa?  We can swarm and take down an entire animal in no time.  Alone, we look very small and vulnerable, but when we all get together in the billions and 
[02:55:00]  come out of our antles, we could take down an elk.  It's a good thing I have an extra set of legs to hold my Walkman.  Is that what you do?  While I'm holding the phone here.  Um, Patty?  Yes.  It's just a guy thing today.  All right.  You'd be the only girl, and you know.  Yeah.  Okay.  I just felt a little lonely over the last couple of days, and it would be fun to be with you  guys in the studio.  But, I mean, I understand.  I understand. 
[02:55:30]  You know when it's just a guy thing, you know?  Yeah.  That's okay.  I understand.  Yeah.  It's not personal.  Even though we have five women here.  But, yeah, it's just a guy thing.  So.  All right, Patty.  We'll see you soon?  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you.  All righty.  All right.  There she goes.  Okay.  Bye-bye.  All right.  Stalker Patty, everyone.  Let's move on to Jay.  Jay, you're next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, O&A.  Hey.  Man, I can't believe I finally got through.  How stupid was she that she handed over the whole box of coloring books? 
[02:56:00]  There's thousands of them here.  You don't want to give them to us?  What?  This is her donation for the relief effort.  No, it isn't.  Oh, yeah.  That's what she said?  That's what she said.  This is her donation.  This is her donation.  That is great.  What the hell kind of donation?  All right.  Go ahead, Jay.  Hey, listen.  My wife calls me 730 this morning, right?  Yeah.  State troopers and dolls.  She works at a bank in Wilmington.  They're sweeping this place.  12 o'clock, she calls me crying. 
[02:56:30]  They're getting evacuated because of a bomb threat.  This is BS, man.  Somebody's got to do something about this crap.  Ah, it's on the way, my friend.  It's on the way.  There's a panic all over the country right now.  There's bomb scares everywhere.  It's ridiculous.  Yeah, this is ridiculous.  Another guy I work with, his wife got evacuated from her building a few times.  Right.  They shit them out, checked it out, nothing wrong, right?  Right.  Get back in, they get another call, you didn't look good enough.  And it turns out, you know, it was coming from in the building.  It worked there. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Hang in there, my friend.  It'll be okay.  Thanks, Jay.  It's not necessary.  Yeah.  Fuck you, Rick.  Rick.  Oh, Rick.  Gee, you are just...  You're the worst.  Put your pants back on.  Everyone's ripping up the magazines, and Rick's got to, like, put it by his ass.  Robert.  I'm wiping with it.  Robert, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  All right.  First off, the police and the firemen are the greatest.  They don't come any better than the police and firemen. 
[02:57:30]  I completely agree, but there's some other people out there that are working their bullies  off, too.  Rick, get some WMI clips.  I'll bless them all.  Everybody who's out there is doing a great job.  Okay.  Peter Jennings.  Yeah.  I think he's got a tint in his pants when things like this happen.  Oh, all these news stations do.  But he likes to see bad things happen.  You can see it.  He's glowing.  He's glowing.  This is making his day.  He won't say anything that's positive.  If he does, I think he's upset about it. 
[02:58:00]  I just, I can't turn him on anymore.  I've got to shut it off.  And Tom Brokaw needs to learn how to speak.  Not that I'm a speaker, but.  Yeah.  And one other thing.  I've had it with the TV coverage.  Nothing new for the last, I don't know, maybe 30 hours now.  Yeah.  When they catch these guys, they should torture them.  Put their nuts in a vice and squeeze slowly.  And if that don't work, then they should move in with my in-laws for like six months.  They'll never do it again.  All right, Robert.  Thank you.  Bye. 
[02:58:30]  Huh?  Let's move on to John.  John, what's up?  Hi.  How you doing, ONA?  Pretty good.  I have one problem.  Everybody keeps on busy saying that justice will prevail.  Yeah.  But I didn't see that by the Simpson trial.  Huh?  I didn't see that by the OJ Simpson trial.  Everybody's saying justice will always prevail.  I didn't see that by the OJ Simpson trial.  I say we should bomb OJ.  Awesome.  You have to have faith in our military, my friend. 
[02:59:00]  There will be justice.  It may take a while, but we can't turn back now, man.  Okay.  We'll see what's going to happen then.  All right.  Thanks, ONA.  Thanks, John.  Bye-bye.  All right.  Bye.  We got to regroup.  We's got to regroup.  You got Jesse Ventura?  Yeah.  Ah, Jesse Ventura.  He was on SmackDown, too?  No.  This was part of a speech.  Okay.  Something else.  All right.  Let's check out Jesse Ventura. 
[02:59:30]  Show the world the strength of Minnesota, because we always lead the nation.  We really and truly do.  Minnesota?  We lead the nation.  Military people, as well as law enforcement people,  please, come in uniform.  If you're in the reserves, if you're on active duty,  of course, police and emergency people that work in the emergency service industry,  wear your uniforms, because that's what this is all about.  Very good. 
[03:00:00]  There you go.  Who else we got?  Anyone else?  Yeah.  We can.  Want to hear Lita?  Lita.  Yeah, we want to hear that.  Oh, my God.  The chicks just have nothing in their head in the WWF.  Not like Bradshaw.  So, mania.  I don't know what to say about something so devastatingly evil.  I mean, that could even make a difference to anyone.  So, I try to delve below. 
[03:00:30]  I've got this layer of numbness over me and discover the emotions that I have and their sadness, anger, fear, helplessness.  It's like all in one.  It almost makes it so I can't take my boobs out.  I mean, who would do something like this?  Why?  What are they trying to accomplish?  You know, we don't understand.  We start to watch and get some of the suspects, the motives, you know, for an event like this.  But what do the answers solve? 
[03:01:00]  It doesn't change anything that's happened.  And, you know, I've watched the TV ever since Tuesday morning like I'm sure everybody else has.  And the only thing that's changed is to become more of a reality.  And all I can say is I've never felt anything like this personally or on a national level.  I can't. 
[03:01:30]  I would never have the audacity to say that I do know what to do in a situation like this.  But on a personal level, whenever I have a problem, large, small, of any level, it always begins with stopping everything and taking a deep breath.  So tonight I hope that the entertainment that we provide for you can help you kind of relax and get your mind off things just for a short time so that you can relax, maybe, and start to take that first deep breath.  Thank you. 
[03:02:00]  Thank you, Lita.  Thank you so much.  Oh, man, this is all about Vince having a little guilt in his head.  Parade all of my superstars out there because I got to pay the rent.  I need to make my money.  That's it.  I don't know.  I'm not buying it.  Mike, you're next.  What's up?  Hey, how are you guys doing?  Pretty good.  I tell you, today I had the day, I've been a zombie for three days. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  I have been non-functioning.  I have not been able to do anything.  And today I woke up and I decided I was going to do something.  Right.  So I found out that they needed a certain amount of supplies and all I had to do was bring them to the Salvation Army.  So me and a couple of my friends went down and we went to a couple of stores.  Some of them hooked us up and some of them charged us regular price.  I filled my SUV up with supplies and we went to the Salvation Army.  And then the guy asked me if I wanted to go with them down to deliver the stuff. 
[03:03:00]  So I'm like, I'm there.  So we drive down and we're at ground zero.  And I have never seen anything like this in my entire life.  I've been in this world 45 years and I have never seen something like this.  It was like...  Of course.  Who has?  But...  This has never happened before.  The analogy I can give you about this is it's like a funeral for a friend and all that's left is the burnt corpse.  I'm telling you, because I used to work downtown and I always used the World Trade Center as my, you know, mark, as where I was. 
[03:03:30]  And now when I look at the little, the two burnt out lobbies, all that's left is the lobbies.  It's just, it just takes your breath away, I swear.  Yeah.  It's unbelievable.  And these guys are working so hard.  I've just never seen people come together and work like this.  And it really is unbelievable. 
[03:04:00]  And we're just looking for some survivors at this point.  We had a guy on earlier.  He said there's no doubt in his mind that we're going to find a bunch of people.  Well, I know that there are spaces in there.  In fact, today there's a lot of spaces.  When the rain came, it washed away a lot of the dust.  And there are like caverns that they can see.  In fact, today they were where they had to have ropes to work on the...  To do work because they were afraid they would fall into the caverns. 
[03:04:30]  The guys in the pit were actually tied together with ropes.  Yeah, that's some bravery.  I don't know if I could go into one of those caverns with a rope tied to me.  Hell no.  I'm a pussy, man.  I'll be not a pussy, man.  I don't know what's going to pop out in front of you or scare you and leave images in your head  that are going to be there for the rest of your life when you try to go to sleep.  Well, I tell you, I've got images that are going to last forever, too.  And I was literally within 10 feet of the tower.  So it will take your breath away.  Okay.  Taking a look at that stuff.  All right, Mike. 
[03:05:00]  But the reason I was calling is we need some stuff tomorrow if anybody wants to help.  Mm-hmm.  I don't know if I can tell you where the center is and what people can bring.  Sure.  Why not?  Go ahead.  We're going to pick it up at the Wall Bounds on the Long Island Specialty Service Road  and Francis Lewis Boulevard at 11 o'clock.  And what's needed is coffee, hot dogs, hot dog rolls, sugar. 
[03:05:30]  We already got plenty of water, plenty of Gatorade.  They just need, you know, and milk.  Okay.  These guys want coffee.  They're working, you know, 24 hours a day, and they need coffee to keep them going.  All right, man.  If anybody wants to help.  I heard protein bars, too.  No, they got plenty of those.  Oh, you got all that?  Okay.  I delivered about 500 today.  Wow.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  All right.  Take care.  Hang in there, man.  Let's move on to another Mike.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, I just want to tell you guys, if you guys remember Josh on Wednesday called, 
[03:06:00]  it was towards the end of the show, it was kind of the most heartbreaking moment I've  ever seen in my life.  Which one was it?  Because we talked to so many people that had some heartbreaking stories.  Well, Josh's dad passed away at the Pentagon.  He started it off with, uh...  Oh, man.  That one killed me.  A 17-year-old kid from Washington?  Exactly.  And his father died at the Pentagon.  Like, literally, I mean, I know we've all had the times where we're sitting around and  we're, like, a little choked up.  We talk about fathers and mothers who passed away and everything. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  But, like, that moment, literally, for me, I just got home from work.  I had my door open out there and cried my eyes out about it.  Yeah, he was asking for answers and we had nothing.  What do you say to a kid like that?  Yeah, and I never cried.  Like, I haven't cried in years.  And I sit there and bawled, just thinking about it.  Like, it really hit home.  Like, I'm almost crying now.  Like, I couldn't believe that I was listening to that.  And just really, just like everybody else in New York, I just want to thank you guys 
[03:07:00]  for letting people voice their opinion and make everybody really a part of this.  Yeah, that was just brutal.  Absolutely brutal.  All right, thank you.  Good work.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  Take care.  All right, peace.  Hey, Frank, you're next on the radio show.  Hey, what's up, ONA?  Hey.  Hey.  I know, it's a sad day, but I spent all day at work looking on the Internet,  reading about this ruling Taliban in Afghanistan.  Yeah.  And that's one effed up country.  No.  I mean, they don't let their women out of the house without a male relative. 
[03:07:30]  If they are, they're beating a public beating.  All right?  The women are not allowed to go to hospitals.  They're not allowed to hold jobs.  The women aren't even allowed to hold jobs.  And, I mean, the country is so messed up.  And we just gave them, a couple months ago, we gave them $48 million,  $10 million of which was supposed to fight the drug, the opium trade,  you know, to the Taliban.  I wouldn't be surprised if they used that money to finance this thing.  But, I mean, I was reading it, and there's millions of people, like, 
[03:08:00]  that are homeless and starving.  And these Taliban guys, man, they've got to get out.  I mean, we've got to do something.  We help a lot of these countries, and then they turn around and spit in our face.  It's just the worst.  Well, I was amazed, because I never heard of these guys before.  And I went, and I said, well, let me learn about them.  Let me see what's going on.  And I think they had something to do with it.  They're hiding the guy from a lot of design targets.  We might as well hit them anyway, you know?  Well, we'll see what happens.  And I think it's starting this weekend, my friends. 
[03:08:30]  Yep.  All right.  All right, man.  Thanks.  Thanks, Frank.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Chris, you're next to the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Good.  I just wanted to let you guys know that I work at the Huntington Hilton on 110.  And I haven't heard about it too much on the radio, but we're taking donations today.  And we're going to run an 18-wheeler to the Javits Center tonight.  Very cool. 
[03:09:00]  So what do you need from us?  We had so many people drop off water and snacks and food.  And what they really need from what I hear is coffee, which we're supplying and other types  of stuff.  But there's one guy who came this morning, first thing in the morning, and no one even  got his name.  And we just wanted to reach out.  And if he can hear us, we wanted to thank him.  The guy went out and bought on his own and dropped off 300 pounds of dog food. 
[03:09:30]  That's cool.  At the hotel today.  And I mean, none of the canines out in the city have any dog food or anything like that.  And it was just amazing.  The guy said, yeah, I just went down to Walmart and took out a couple of hundred bucks and  figured I'd buy some stuff for some people because, you know, I don't really need to  worry about it this weekend.  I'm okay.  And it was like, it's incredible how much like these people are, you know, reaching  out and stepping up and you would never think about it. 
[03:10:00]  We did a blood drive a couple of days ago at nine o'clock in the morning.  We were on a four hour wait for people just to give blood.  And the people just waited.  And they sat around in the lobby and had a cup of coffee and waited their turn and that  was it.  Yeah.  It was amazing.  Cool.  But if this guy was listening to the show, we just wanted to thank him so much.  Hey, that's great, Chris.  All right.  All right.  Take it easy, guys.  Thank you.  Ciao.  Bye. 
[03:10:30]  Mike, what's going on?  Hello.  Hey, Mike.  Hey, how you doing?  Pretty good.  Hey, last time I spoke to you guys, which was a while ago, it was much better circumstances,  but.  Well, we'll get back to that.  Yeah, you got that.  But just sitting here thinking about everything.  It's just so amazing.  I know you guys have been hearing it a hundred times today, but you got to really, you guys really  got to deserve what you're getting, what you guys are doing right now.  So many people get to call up and give them all these stories that they've got, heartbreaking  stories that people need to hear and really know what the damage is that's happened, you  know?  Yeah.  And you guys are giving that forum to everyone, man. 
[03:11:00]  And that's like the best thing that could go on right now.  I have no idea and cannot understand how any radio station could be playing music right  now.  Well, yeah, we can't, we can't get to everyone out there.  I know.  You know what I mean?  It's like, it's really hard to get to get to you guys.  And there's just so many stories that people need.  This is like therapy for everybody.  They need this so bad.  I don't even know what we're really doing.  We're just opening the phone lines.  I hope this is interesting to people out there.  Yeah, you guys are doing more than that, though, man.  You're doing a lot more than that, though.  You guys are, you know, you guys got it going on.  There's no doubt. 
[03:11:30]  You're really helping a lot of people.  All right.  Well, cool.  It's a big thing, you know.  I just, basically, everybody gets to call up and say, you know, where's the help and where  to go and what to do.  Right.  You know, and it's a great thing, man.  You guys are doing a hell of a job, man, really.  Hey, thanks, Mike.  You got it.  Have a good weekend.  You too, man.  Or at least try, because I know I'm going to try.  Let's go to Dave in Boston.  Dave, what's up?  Yo, you guys are doing an awesome job.  Thanks, Dave.  And, hey, you guys, you're going to not believe this crap.  I was just flipping through your last break, and Rock Hole is concerned that the people 
[03:12:00]  are returning tickets for their local bazooka, and he's pleading with people, you know,  he understands the tragedy, but he doesn't understand why people aren't coming, that they  need to come together for an event like this.  Oh, my God.  Wait, I got to say, I love how people's true colors are coming out.  Right.  I just love that.  From the politicians to the other radio stations to the newscasters, I love this.  Are you kidding me?  You want to explain this to me? 
[03:12:30]  I thought you guys would want to hear that.  It made me want to puke.  After you're flipping around, I just listened to, you know, God bless the USA, and he's a local  bazooka, support your local groups.  We know it drives you, but this is what makes America, America.  Ah, that whole, you know, you know what makes America, America?  Being able to just talk openly like this and supporting your government and the military  when we finally respond to this.  It's not things like making sure Thursday, Smackdown gets on the air and making sure local 
[03:13:00]  bazooka, which is, it's like a, some kind of a music thing that goes on up in Worcester,  Worcester, Massachusetts.  They do it every year.  And it's really, it's quite the little sham for the bands, against the bands.  What they do, they make every band, the local bands, you know, they have some headliners,  but the local bands, they say, hey, you're going to be on the future stars stage. 
[03:13:30]  So they make them buy tickets.  They make the bands buy tickets for a large chunk of change.  We're talking in the thousands of dollars.  And you've been in a few bands.  Yes, pay to play it's called.  Yeah, most bands have no money whatsoever.  They scrape their money together to get their equipment.  And, you know, then they do gigs for $50 a night and split that ten ways.  But they say they can make money because what you do is you take the tickets that they have 
[03:14:00]  so generously sold you.  Now you go out to your friends and make them pay to come and see you.  That's what kind of a sham they're running there with the local bazooka.  There's your pals at AAF.  There's Dave Dickless just more screwing over of the local bands.  And now apparently people want to return these tickets and say, look, we're not playing.  Some of the local bands are saying, I don't feel it's right now to get out and start rocking on the stage. 
[03:14:30]  And I guess Dave Dickless has gotten his little puppet rock hole to get on the air  and plead with these bands to come and play anyway.  Even though the bands themselves feel maybe it's not appropriate,  maybe their stage act, maybe their songs aren't appropriate to perform at a time like this.  And they have the smarts and the feeling enough to not want to go and perform. 
[03:15:00]  But Dave's shill, rock hole, now is on the air pleading with these bands to come and play anyway  and make sure you bring your goddamn ticket money.  That's a good point.  That's a pretty sick.  A fruity and disgrace.  You're right.  True color shine through.  You guys rock, man.  All right.  Thanks, bro.  Goodbye.  God damn, man.  You know, that is just, we didn't even mention it because it was enough of an abomination  that bands were being screwed over with this event.  But, you know, it's the way of the world. 
[03:15:30]  But when now this is added to it, a tragedy like this,  and Dave Dickless has his shill rocko to try to get the bands to come through with the cash,  it's just, I don't know.  I guess people's true colors come shining through.  Whatever.  When something like this happens, it's disgusting.  It's okay.  It's disgusting.  It's okay with me.  It's all right.  Whatever.  It's all right.  People aren't stupid. 
[03:16:00]  Josh, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  What we really need, I'm finishing, I just got finished digging for 11 hours.  What we really need, we got plenty of water.  We got plenty of food.  Gloves.  Gloves.  We need gloves.  Every time you find the body part, you got to change gloves so that DNA doesn't get mixed up.  You're going through this muck that's wet.  Josh.  You got to change gloves.  Josh, slow down.  So you're uncovering body parts as you go, huh? 
[03:16:30]  There's, you have no idea.  How do you deal with that?  I haven't gone to sleep yet.  I'll let you know tomorrow after I get a couple of hours.  But it's just, it's brutal.  It's something.  So you're just digging on your hands and knees, basically.  And, you know.  You're digging, you're putting it in a bucket, you're passing the bucket down.  But every time you come across a body part, you call for a body bag.  The gloves go in the body bag with the body part. 
[03:17:00]  And then you have to get new gloves.  And you need new gloves.  Leather palm gloves, heavy rubber gloves, gloves.  All right.  Plenty of water, plenty of food, gloves.  Gloves.  That's it.  Home Depot sent over.  Home Depot has been great.  Yeah.  Buckets.  You know, any tool you could possibly think of.  They're out of gloves.  You know, you got 4,000 guys working. 
[03:17:30]  It's a lot of gloves.  Hmm.  All right, Josh.  I was just reading something on the S&P bag.  Now, you're pretty close to ground zero.  Well, what are the odds that we're going to find some more people alive?  And you're...  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  God.  Definitely.  Yeah.  There are voids in there that are, you know, 20 feet long, 7 feet tall.  Right.  It's amazing.  Now, this is going to sound really naive because I'm not down there and I have no clue. 
[03:18:00]  What is the holdup as far as getting into some of these areas?  They're in those areas.  The problem is to get from there to the next area, you have to cut the steel out and you  can't cut the steel out from underneath.  Okay.  You got to cut the steel out from up top because it weakens everything below it.  Right.  And, for example, in the news, you see them working with the excavators with the grappling 
[03:18:30]  hooks at the end.  Uh-huh.  That's on the West Side Highway or what was the West Side Highway.  Yeah.  They haven't even connected from one end to the other on the West Side Highway yet.  They estimate a million tons of debris there.  They've taken out 12,000.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  So, I mean, you're racing against the clock because these people can't survive down there 
[03:19:00]  forever.  Josh?  Josh?  Hello?  Okay, Josh.  Thank you.  We've got a lot of info out of him, though.  Frank, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, guys.  Hey.  I have a pretty serious theory that our vice president may be dead.  He's the only one that hasn't come on TV and said anything about this whole deal.  Well, I mean, we can't start any rumors.  I would like to see him on TV myself, but you got to think he's pretty busy right now. 
[03:19:30]  You know?  You know?  Everybody else seems to be busy, and they showed up on TV and said something.  He's the vice president is planning the attack.  Dude, he's with military leaders this whole time in a war room planning the attack of whatever  countries we're going to bomb.  So, it's a good thing we haven't seen him.  Plus, he's got a bad ticker.  Well, that's why.  Keep him nice and calm down there in the air-conditioned war room. 
[03:20:00]  That's right.  And let him talk to the military leaders and get women fanning him 24 hours a day.  Thanks, Frank.  All right.  Thanks.  All right, man.  Let's go to Jimmy.  Jimmy, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, guys.  I just want to...  I'm going to get emotional, so I want to apologize right now.  All right?  Okay.  My brother's in the Navy, and he's leaving on Monday for the Middle East, his ship leaves.  And I just want to say, don't forget all the people that were lost in the bombing, but 
[03:20:30]  also, don't forget all the military men that are going out there, because I don't know if  I'm ever going to see my brother again.  Wow.  I'm sorry, guys.  You know, it's just making me think I might never see him again for some stupid shit.  I'm real sorry, guys.  I just wanted to call him and say that.  There's nothing to be sorry about, Jimmy.  Yeah.  I mean, what do you say?  It's a scary time for everyone, you know?  And he's shipping out Monday. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah.  He just called me yesterday.  What does he do?  He's in the Navy.  I mean, what does he do in the Navy?  Well, he's an engine man.  Yeah.  But they told him that, if anything, he would be one of the first people to, like, land  and start doing stuff.  They're just preparing them all out.  He's out in California.  That's just what they're preparing him for right now.  What kind of ship is he on?  I'm not exactly sure.  No?  Well, is he pumped?  What?  Is he pumped up? 
[03:21:30]  Yeah.  He's pretty big for his size.  Yeah.  I mean, he's only like 5'7", you know?  Right.  But he's big for his size.  And he loves you guys, too.  Well, we'll be thinking about him.  All right.  All right, Jimmy.  Hang in there, okay?  All right.  Thanks, guys.  All right, man.  If it's any consolation, which, you know, I doubt it to any of these families of people  that are going to be going over there and doing the deed, is the fact that the commitment  to this action is going to be huge. 
[03:22:00]  People aren't going to be left out there hanging out there to dry, you know what I mean?  It's going to be the opening salvo like we saw in the Gulf War.  Before any people hit the beaches here, you're definitely going to see just a devastating attack  with cruise missiles and air power.  A devastating first blow.  And that's the way we have to conduct our warfare in this day and age. 
[03:22:30]  That's it, you know?  And we have the technology to do it.  And that's how we do it.  So if it's any consolation, the best of the best, you know, the United States military,  it knows how to take care of itself.  And it knows how to keep itself out of danger or, you know, keep the danger to a minimum  as much as you can when you're in that circumstance.  But, you know, you've just got to keep that in mind.  All right.  Otto wants in.  Otto!  Hello.  Otto from Otto and George. 
[03:23:00]  What's up, bro?  Hi, guys.  How are you holding up?  Hey.  All right.  Yeah.  It's devastating.  I live in Edgewater, so I was able to see a lot of the burning and dying.  It was just terrible.  We need some John Wayne-type action.  Yeah.  Yeah, with John Wayne when you need him.  I'm going back to work tonight, so I don't know.  I just, like, do I talk about it?  It's like, if I don't talk about it, everything I talk about is going to seem trite.  And then if I do talk about it, I'm a monster, you know? 
[03:23:30]  Well, I don't know how you comics deal with this stuff.  I mean, it's, how do you go into a club and start doing your act?  And, you know, everybody's freaked out about what they've seen.  I'm just going under the assumption that people are going out for entertainment  and I have to deliver.  I mean, there were a lot of comedians during the Depression that did well.  And, you know, anybody who's going to go out needs some escape.  You know, every TV set I walk by in my neighborhood when I walk my dog,  they're watching the Andy Griffith show. 
[03:24:00]  Like, they're trying to, you know, escape to an innocent time.  How do I buy that?  I think if people are going to a comedy club this weekend, yeah,  they're going to want to hear something a little different to get their minds off this.  Yeah, I mean, entertainment is there to forget that, you know,  especially at a time like this when you can't do a damn thing.  There's nothing you can do.  Right.  Except go shoot the guy you buy lottery tickets from at the gas station.  But, you know, it's innocent, you know.  It's just.  Yeah. 
[03:24:30]  And so anybody who wants to see a depressed ventriloquist,  I'll be at the groove tonight, Lyndhurst.  All right, Otto.  Yeah.  And what's the story?  They're not letting anybody in the building?  Not really.  Security's pretty tight.  Really?  Yeah.  That's understandable.  A few of the guys got through, but.  Yeah, they really cracked down.  We were going to try to throw a, not a party,  but just we were trying to get a big get-together going today,  but it didn't work, so.  Right, right. 
[03:25:00]  What, do you got to get badges now?  I mean, IDs and stuff?  Yeah, I think we're going to need them.  Yeah?  Yeah, I haven't had them in three years, so.  Damn.  I'm going to need one now.  Yeah.  Where are your papers?  Oh, man.  All right, Otto, good luck to you, my friend.  Okay, thanks, boys.  We'll see you soon, all right?  Take it easy.  All right.  Let's go to Lorenzo.  Yeah.  Yo, Lorenzo.  Oh, dear.  Anthony.  Oh, dear, my brother.  It's good to hear you and good health.  Opie.  Hey, Lorenzo, when are you going to get a good phone?  Yeah, I know. 
[03:25:30]  This phone sucks.  You always have a bad phone.  I don't know, man.  But it's been a hell of a week, you know?  Yeah.  Hell, yeah.  I mean, it's just, you know.  What's the mood of the hood?  Yo, man.  Yo, believe it or not.  I mean, even the most thuggish of persons that I know are, you know, I can only describe  it as faint with fear.  People are, you know, especially Tuesday night going into Wednesday.  I didn't go to sleep. 
[03:26:00]  I was glued to the TV, and I wanted to grasp all the information and all the images of  what was happening.  And it was something.  It was surreal.  And I couldn't believe it was happening, dude.  But like I said Tuesday, I thought it was a stunt, man.  I thought it was a stunt.  Yeah.  A commercial.  Something, bro.  Nothing.  I didn't want it to be what it was, you know?  Yeah.  And I saw the buildings going.  It's horrific.  And, yo, there's a cataclysmic event in the history of this nation. 
[03:26:30]  The reaction of the people, you know?  I mean, and a big F you to the media, releasing the names of the terrorists, okay, I think  in my view, they're compromising the investigation that's going on because they are not supposed  to release the names of these people.  If there's somebody who knows one of the persons that's on the list, they're going to skedaddle.  You know what I mean, dude?  They're gone.  Yeah, well, I think they're all trying to skedaddle if they know anyone involved with 
[03:27:00]  us anyway, so.  I mean, come on.  Keep the airports closed.  Keep everything closed.  Keep it on lockdown.  They got to get, they got to really, they got some control of the situation, but it's  still, I think it's still pretty chaotic out there, you know?  They don't really know the extent, if there was a country or it's just we're dealing with  individuals, you know?  Yeah.  I mean, I'm not even talking as old dirty here, man.  I'm shook, my brother, shook. 
[03:27:30]  It's like the WWF, see?  It's not old dirty.  I mean, we're talking to Lorenzo.  Lorenzo.  You know what I mean, dog?  It's like we didn't hear from The Rock, we heard from Dwayne Johnson.  Man.  You can't show the fear, my brother.  No, no, never that.  That's what this is all about, the terror and the fear.  You can't show that, my brother.  You're down with that, Opie?  Word?  Word.  Your word, man.  You got to keep it gangster, you know?  Hells yeah.  Did you see all that firepower above the city today when the president landed? 
[03:28:00]  Huh?  That was unbelievable.  Forget about your tax dollars going into welfare programs and everything.  There goes the artillery, kid.  That's it.  You know what I mean?  But I had a problem getting into the building.  They wouldn't let me in.  I'm going to try on Monday.  Yeah, they're not letting anyone in for some reason.  We got to work that out because we need our peeps back.  Uncle Sam got some mad fat...  Some mad fat weapons, yo. 
[03:28:30]  Yo, this country, we do have the fat artillery.  The fat artillery, G.  Yo, you want to know something on a serious note?  Huh?  The world changed on Tuesday morning, kid.  It's a whole different ballgame.  And if these people are radical enough that they would do something as horrific as this,  then biological terrorism and economic terrorism, I mean, it's, you know, you can't put anything 
[03:29:00]  past these people.  These people need to be arrested.  They need to be dealt with in a manner that's going to effectively diminish the threat to  this country.  We're up to the challenge, my friend.  I hope so, dude.  You know, I'm standing with you, too, my brother.  I have all the confidence in the world in our president right now.  I would like to say that.  I don't think...  I know.  Yeah, I don't think they're stupid.  As a matter of fact, George Bush, when he was down there at Ground Zero, he was standing 
[03:29:30]  up on a pile of rubble, talking to the workers with a bullhorn.  Yeah.  And at one point, somebody yelled, or a few people in the crowd started yelling that they  couldn't hear him.  Yeah.  They said, I can't hear you.  So he said, he goes, I can hear you.  He said, the rest of the world hears you, and the people who knocked these buildings down  will hear all of us soon.  Yeah.  So, oof.  Oof.  Can only wait.  You know what else? 
[03:30:00]  You know what I think else needs to be said?  What?  All these congressmen and all these little politicos, they need to step back away and  stop looking for the photo opportunity, because sometimes you get the feeling that they're  doing it for that.  You know what I'm saying?  I hope you guys are noticing that, because I see it.  I see it.  You know, and it's sickening, bro.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  Yo, save the photo op for a better time, my brother.  We're not even thinking about re-electing nobody at this point. 
[03:30:30]  Keep Giuliani in there.  Anthony talked about leaders yesterday.  It was a great little 15 minutes of the show yesterday.  Yeah, no doubt.  Well, you know, leaders are definitely not born, you know?  I don't see Hillary being a leader right now.  I don't see Chuck Schumer being a leader right now.  No way.  Someone that we have criticized on this show many, many times, the mayor of this fine city,  has turned out to be a leader.  He has.  Under some tough, you know, circumstances.  Yeah.  He's great at emergency management. 
[03:31:00]  He knows crap about art and morality and all that happy horse crap.  But as far as crisis, leadership, the guy's right there at the top.  Yeah.  Hey, Lorenzo, when are you going to get a phone in your crib?  If the federal government would extend the stay, you know, would find it, you know,  to let a man as his opinionated as himself to have free phone service, hey.  Free phone service. 
[03:31:30]  You're on a street corner right now, right?  Yeah, man.  I heard hooking going on behind you and drug dealing.  There's a whole, you know, life is going on here in small pockets, you know?  I hear it.  Glenn from Elizabeth, New Jersey, says, wow, all dirty, use the word cataclysmic.  Is that the one word?  Is that one his word of the day calendar that he stole from his last job?  Oh, man. 
[03:32:00]  All right, Lorenzo.  All right, baby.  Try to keep the hat up.  Yeah, we're trying.  I'll see you guys on Monday.  Peace out, B.  Peace, baby.  All right.  Let's go to Psycho Mark.  Mark A.  Who would have ever thought my neighborhood would look like old dirties?  Oh, man.  Sorry.  I couldn't help it.  Just a joke.  Wow.  Hey, we have a satellite photo of the whole mess.  Yeah.  It's pretty amazing how close your building is.  Yeah, we highlighted your building, and you're like, you're right there. 
[03:32:30]  Uh, guys?  Yeah.  Yeah.  If he missed that plane, if that plane missed the World Trade Center, I was next.  Yeah.  Let me see.  Which angle?  Yeah, I guess so.  No, no, no, dude, dude, uh, trust me.  Yeah, okay.  I was looking right at him.  I was next.  That engine came off the plane and bounced down Church Street off my bank, bounced off  Fleet Bank building about six stories up, and came to rest two and a half blocks from  my house.  Oh, wow.  Man.  But, uh, enough of that.  Hey, guys, I don't know if, I just happen to tune in to some other radio stations, but 
[03:33:00]  what morons?  God, what losers.  They're giving away, like, tickets for, like, hey, bring down some Gatorade, and we'll give  you a free pair of tickets to see some show.  It's like, losers.  They just don't know how to handle this.  Dude, I mean, that's wrong.  And they're putting all these montages together of stupid stuff of, like, sound effects, of  sound bites, of, like, oh, it's coming down, you know, it's like, huh.  I know, with the music.  Oh, and yeah, like, all these gay songs.  It's like, you know, the idiot program director's coming up with these, oh, let's get some really 
[03:33:30]  heartfelt music, you know, it's like, why don't you just shut the F up and play  the same old crap?  You know what, 1010 Wins comes in and out of their breaks with this, the most depressing  sounding music.  I don't even know where they got it from.  I think it was the depressing orchestra playing the most depressing hits of the depression.  It's, they're horrendous.  And then over that, they play clips of people breaking down crying during interviews, and  it's painful to listen to. 
[03:34:00]  And I hate the fact that they're doing that.  It's fine if it's something spontaneous where they're talking to somebody and they happen  to lose it.  But, but to then record it and play it over the most depressing music.  Dude, it's brutal.  Awful.  I can't tell you how happy I am to be standing behind a camera worrying about whether or not  a stupid BNC cable and an RCA cable are getting wet, rather than having to worry about the  whole fact of watching it on TV.  I just, I can't even imagine.  Marcus from, Marcus from Philly says, it's a shame Opie isn't depressed enough to stop 
[03:34:30]  bouncing that effing bottle cap.  What?  Shut up.  Shut up, yo, you faggot.  Dude, my roommate left the windows open.  I'm going to punch him right in the yambag.  He's such a moron.  It smells like smoke.  Dude, no, I saw it from, we were on top of the live shot.  I look over my building, I'm counting the windows down.  I go, that faggot left the window open. 
[03:35:00]  So, I had to climb up to 43 stories to get my crap out.  I closed all the windows because they're wide open, yo.  So, I'm like losing.  I'm like, what did he run down to Chelsea for a quickie?  I mean, come on.  He ran down to Chelsea for a fast one.  As soon as the power went off, oh, I got to run, oh, oh, oh.  I got to blow, oh, you know what I mean?  All right.  Marcus is coming back to life.  You're coming back to life, my friend.  Dude, I apologize.  On TV, dude, I aged 40 years in front of that camera. 
[03:35:30]  I apologize after what I saw.  Hey, there's a sergeant in the Marine Corps that wants in.  I got to talk to him.  Go ahead, guys.  I got to run.  God bless America.  Wow.  Look at you.  There you go, Mark.  No, Mark is really into this stuff.  Hell yeah.  He's right on, Mark.  Patriotic.  All right, let's go to, ah.  Did I lose him?  Hello?  Kevin.  Hey, guys.  Hoorah.  Hoorah.  Super five.  We're heading down to Camp Le Dune this weekend.  I'm a 2nd Marine, 10th Battalion, artillery unit. 
[03:36:00]  Nice.  We usually put stickers on our 055s, which is a howitzer.  Howitzer rounds from the artillery.  Yeah.  I'm going to put a wow sticker on it.  Nice.  That's what we want to see.  I'm psyched.  I'm going to blow the shit out of them.  You know, hold on.  Management's been really cool with dumping out of our show.  Yeah.  I hope they let that through.  Yeah.  They're going to bomb the ass out of them.  Well, Monday we will return to a...  See, this is all right.  We need to hear this confidence coming from our military people, man. 
[03:36:30]  Absolutely, man.  Shut the fuck, guys.  We're all behind you, my brother.  There you go.  Keep safe and kick some ass, man.  Thank you.  Sergeant.  Go get him.  Go get him, man.  I love that.  In true military marine fashion.  Let's go to Fabio.  Hey, guys.  How you doing, man?  You guys have been great.  I don't think I have to tell you that. 
[03:37:00]  I'm glad Psycho Mark brought up all the sappy music that's being played.  And, you know, at first it was appropriate.  But now it's time to head into a different direction.  And maybe you guys should end your show with Marilyn Manson's fight song.  Marilyn Manson, maybe.  Well, all right, Fabio.  Thank you.  All right.  All right, bye.  Glenn the Tool again checking in.  In two weeks, is Psycho Mark going to sue you guys for more money for appearing on your  show today?  Yes.  I think we've gotten past that.  That was more a problem with Psycho Mark and management and the company than it is with 
[03:37:30]  Psycho Mark and this program.  We'd have to be insane to keep him off of this show.  Why is this reporter glowing?  What is he?  That's odd.  He's orange.  It looks like he's got dust and then wiped off certain sections.  Or is that his makeup?  Probably his makeup.  And then he had to wipe his face because of the rain and stuff down there.  And he wiped half his makeup off.  Melissa, what's going on?  Hi.  I'm from southern New Hampshire.  Have you had anybody you talked to from up here? 
[03:38:00]  Oh, we've been talking to people from mostly Boston, Philly, New York, and Washington.  Okay.  Well, I have to start out by telling you, first of all, I'm not a fan of yours.  And I'm not the demographic you really hit.  Okay.  But, and in fact, I'm so not a fan that my fiance absolutely loves you.  Absolutely.  You're always on the radio.  That's how I found you.  Yeah.  And I've taken to calling you.  Whenever you're on, I tell Dan to get Ollie and Andy to hell off my radio.  Ollie and Andy, Opie and Dopey, Dopey and Craphead.  The title, the title, the title, the title, the title, Dumber. 
[03:38:30]  I've been trying to get through.  I've been trying to get through because I have had it with the radio stations in Boston  where they're, I mean, they won't, they won't let angry people, quote, unquote, like me get through.  Yeah.  I have nowhere to channel my, in southern New Hampshire now.  I mean, it's so, the only good thing I can say that I'm seeing coming from this is how we're all coming together.  We've got flags everywhere.  Every sign says God bless America.  It's bringing us together.  But I don't know what to do with my energy.  And I've been trying to get through to you because I'm so angry. 
[03:39:00]  I'm so sad.  I don't know what to do with this energy.  I'm seeing Arabs in cars on the way down the highway.  And I'm wondering if I should report them.  I don't know for what.  Yeah, I feel bad for the Arab Americans, man.  But I'm scared.  Yeah, we're all scared.  I'm looking a little differently at them.  I mean, you know, I've got to be honest.  And I don't feel that.  You don't know.  You don't know.  I'm not going to wrap anyone in my head.  No, no.  We had a horrific story on the show earlier.  And you want to tell the people in case they're just tuning in? 
[03:39:30]  Philadelphia.  Sorry, go ahead.  YSP.  They were having people come down and drop off essential goods, things that people have  been asking for to help out in the relief.  And the outpouring of support, unbelievable.  They had over 1,000 people outside the radio station.  They're filling up truck after truck after truck.  And they're heading to New York with all these supplies.  So all of a sudden, up rolls a truck full of Arab men, about five or six of them, did  she say?  They get out in full regalia. 
[03:40:00]  I mean, they had the robe thing on, the turbans, the big beards.  And people were looking like, what the hell is this about?  They open up the truck and start giving equipment and supplies and, you know, smiling to each  other.  And some people, they were tearing up.  And cheering.  Yes.  People started cheering.  Listen how their story ends.  The Arab guys were tearing up at the emotion that was there.  Some son of a bitch.  I don't mean to laugh because it's an uncomfortable laugh. 
[03:40:30]  It's typical, is what it is.  Some son of a bitch from the crowd runs up and punches one of them right in the face,  one of the Arab guys, right in the face.  And the whole crowd.  And the whole, it just, it ruined the moment.  It was, it's exactly like if you watch Mars Attacks.  And you see when the girl releases the dove after we greet the aliens and it flies away  and the nice music's playing and all of a sudden the alien just pulls out the laser 
[03:41:00]  gun and, and shoots the dove.  It's exactly what it was like.  That tender moment where you could almost picture the music that would fit the mood  perfect.  And then some jackass runs toward him and punches him in the face.  Oh, you silly humans.  I just, I do want to applaud you, you people.  I just, thank you for letting me get through.  Thank you for letting me express some of my anger.  I'm still, I don't know what to do with all this energy.  I'm going to sit on my steps with my vigil tonight at seven o'clock. 
[03:41:30]  Something I got in my email.  And basically I wanted to say, you know, I'm, I'm not your demographic.  I'm 28.  I'm a real estate agent in Southern New Hampshire.  Hold on.  Slow down.  That's our demo.  We got 28 year old ladies listening to us like crazy.  Yeah.  I thought when you said you were out of a demo, you were an older woman.  I don't, I'm not, you know, you're not like my favorite music.  I don't listen to your type of music, but you are.  I'm definitely going to be listening to you from now on.  And I just wanted to say that I totally, totally, I totally believe that this country needs to be cut out like a cancer. 
[03:42:00]  Like so many of your listeners have said, I mean, I just saw something on, on channel 12 news or channel nine news this afternoon that Osama bin Laden was having these DVDs put out for children, training children to be terrorists.  It made me sick to my stomach.  They actually showed children in school training with the little caps on, and then they would take them out instead of for recess to train them in military exercises.  Yeah.  Six, seven year olds.  It made me sick. 
[03:42:30]  And I, you know.  Well, the rules have changed, Melissa.  Yeah.  And Melissa, we can only hope that after enough time it goes by and after the military does what we know it's going to do, that we can get back to the point where you effing hate us again.  Because I really, I really don't like the idea that you're enjoying us.  No, no.  I really, really.  And thank you.  Thank God I got through because I got to say my piece and that's what you've been like.  And every other radio station is going back to like music and I've had it.  Yeah.  Okay.  I don't think it's appropriate yet. 
[03:43:00]  All right, Melissa.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  Yeah.  We don't think it's appropriate either.  I'm kidding.  Come on.  We're going to continue just talking, Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're not going back to music.  No.  I don't even think we're going to go back to doing music on Monday.  Right.  All next week we will not play music.  No music on this program.  That's right.  We're making a stand.  Derek, what's going on?  Hey, how are you doing, guys?  Wait a minute.  Hey.  Listen, I did four years in the Marine Corps active duty. 
[03:43:30]  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'm sorry.  We got to ease up on the language.  We really do.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm sorry.  That's my fault.  Yeah.  Listen, I'm like, you know, you go four years active, you got four years in active.  So I'm torn, you know?  Half of me is like, I'm a little scared, but I'm dying to, you know, this, I'm almost waiting  for the call.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  I just want to get back in there.  I just want to get back into it.  I got my gear all out and I'm thinking about it, but it's scary. 
[03:44:00]  And the one thing I just really want to say is that this is something that we have to do.  Just for the memory of every other person that ever was a soldier and ever went to fight  any other war for this country, I mean, we are much better equipped.  We have, you know, technology has improved the military just with food and with weapons.  And, you know, when you think about what other people have done with not, you know, they didn't  have the kind of technology that we have today. 
[03:44:30]  I know that, you know, we haven't had a war that is going to last as long as this, because  I'm thinking this is a minimum of five years, five-year engagement to do it right.  Wow.  All right.  All right, guys.  That's all I wanted to say.  Thank you, Derek.  All right.  Let's go to Tom.  Tom, you're next.  Tommy, we lose you, Tom.  No, I'm here.  Okay, let's go.  Hey, you guys there? 
[03:45:00]  Yeah, let's go, Tom.  First, I want to request Led Zeppelin, because you play music all the time.  No music.  We're going music free.  Oh, wrong station.  For a while, I think.  This is our new format.  We need to talk now.  Really?  I need another station.  No.  Hey.  Oh, ow.  No, I'm kidding.  No, what I want to tell you guys is I've been in the military.  Active duty for 18 years.  I'm looking at retiring here in two years, and now this crap is going on, and it's given  a new perspective on things to me. 
[03:45:30]  And if you guys could only see what is going on in our military bases right now, because  the other day, I tried to send you instant feedback, because you were kind of bashing  our president about not reacting, Anthony.  Yeah?  You've got to...  You've got to...  I hope you've been listening, because we've changed our...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I wasn't bashing him on what he was saying.  I was bashing him on the fact that I really felt he could be a little more personal about  it and kind of convey more of his feelings than just reading a written speech. 
[03:46:00]  That's all I said.  But in my instant feedback, I tried to say, as I tried to explain, that the American people  needed to see our president strong and firm and not showing emotions that he was in control.  Yeah, I understand that part of it.  I only like my Vulcans without emotion, to tell you the truth.  Hey, hey, hey.  Spock was the greatest guy on Earth.  But anyway, yeah, my point is, is what is going on in this country right now with our 
[03:46:30]  military, if I could tell you, you would not believe what is happening.  We are prepared.  We are going to deal with this.  And it's going to be taken care of.  It's going to be a long situation.  My 20 years is probably going to be extended just a little bit longer.  20 years.  But...  No, he's been in 18.  I've been in 18.  I thought the operation was going to take 20 years.  No, no.  It's not going to take 20 years.  I don't have time for that.  I got things to do.  Yeah, I want to retire.  All right, Tom, wrap it up because we're running out of time. 
[03:47:00]  Yeah, I know you are.  And here's my final statement.  You guys are doing a great job.  The people of this country have come together.  The people of New York have come together.  We're really seeing what this country really is.  All right.  So put your damn flags out and show pride in your country.  All right.  Thank you, Tom.  Have a good one, guys.  You too, my friend.  Why would that one guy say it would take five years?  Oh, and A.  Why?  Oh, and A.  Hold on.  You honestly think this is going to be just a short little thing?  No, but five years? 
[03:47:30]  Do you think they will?  It's going to take a while, my friend.  Yeah.  A lot of people think it's as easy as dropping, it's been said, a few nukes or, you know.  Hey, a couple of nukes would be great.  Well, that would make the statement, but, you know, you've got to get to the true root  of the problem.  These guys are funded, and they're all over the place.  We don't know where they are.  They were living in, some of them were living in Hollywood, Florida.  In Jersey.  In Jersey, all over the place.  Well, there we go.  Frank Bishop from Allentown, Pennsylvania, pissed off at the Opium Anthem show. 
[03:48:00]  I will never listen again.  Who do you think you are to make fun and laugh at the people at the WWF for sharing their  feelings on what happened?  Now, hold the phone, Frank.  You listen to that Stephanie McMahon speech where she is trying to tell the story about  her parents and their struggle with the courts and trying to equate that to what happened 
[03:48:30]  on Tuesday, and you tell me that that is, that we shouldn't make fun of that.  Come on, Frank.  Give me a break.  Bye-bye, Frank.  Hey.  Mark.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  How's it going?  Pretty good.  Yeah, well, you know, I found out a couple days ago, obviously, this happened to all of  us, but I live up in Connecticut, right in the Fairfield area, and, you know, there's pretty  much a lot of people working in that building.  So, a lot of people have been missing, and, I mean, I've been raging, and I've just been 
[03:49:00]  getting so much out of here, and everybody, you know, say their piece on your show, and  it's helped me.  Like, I'm a songwriter, and I wrote something, and I hope I can say my point, and you guys  will just let me have two minutes, you know, real quick.  It's a really powerful song.  It's called Bomb That Terrorist Land.  So, if you guys will let me just play that real quick.  It's on CD.  I did it today, and I don't know if you guys would be cool with that.  But, you know, real quick, if you don't like it, you can cut it off, but just...  You know what?  Send it in. 
[03:49:30]  Yeah, Mark, please send it in.  Because, yeah, did it just go like this when we're under these circumstances?  All right.  I just wanted you guys to hear it first, because I'm going to send it to basically  every place, but you guys are my favorite, you know, and I just wanted you to hear it.  Well, just send it in, and we'll try to play it on Monday, okay?  All right.  Right on.  All right, man.  Take care.  Thank you, Mark.  We are just about out of here, my friend.  Oh, Vangie wants in.  The sister from the hood.  Vangie!  Hey, how are you guys doing?  Hey. 
[03:50:00]  Listen, when you were talking about other stations playing commercials, I had just turned to this  other station last night for us, because they were playing some inspirational music,  but they made the...  What's inspirational music to you, Vangie?  Some Al Green?  No.  No?  No, it was one of the songs where, when we fall down, we'll get up.  It was something like a gospel song.  Gospel music.  Yeah.  Well, none of them.  It wasn't all gospel music, but anyway, what totally turned me off was they started this  commercial advertising torno watches and where you could buy them, and they were rattling 
[03:50:30]  off all the places, and one of the places was the World Trade Center.  Oh, boy.  And I could not believe it, that they were so hungry for money that they couldn't just,  like, you know...  At least listen to the commercial.  Yeah.  I mean, like, the world...  It was appropriate.  Yeah, and this was, like, last night, and I couldn't believe it.  It's, you know, one of the local radio stations here.  Wow.  And it's really quiet up here.  You don't hear the SUVs going by with the blast of music like you usually do. 
[03:51:00]  Right.  All right, Vangie.  Thanks for sharing.  Okay, guys.  All right.  We got to go.  All right.  Bye-bye.  All right.  Ah, Lou, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing out there, man?  Good.  All right.  I'm out east, guys, and it's the most intense thing I've ever seen.  It's a beautiful rainbow, and now there's another one coming up.  It's a double rainbow, so bright and intense.  Where are you?  Out east by exit 62 on the LIE on the south shore.  It goes from the south shore, like, to the north shore. 
[03:51:30]  You see two huge rainbows?  Yeah.  Cool.  Symbolic for me, man, because what's going on, man, it's just, it's like growing.  It's unreal.  See, things you just take for granted.  All of a sudden, it's a little cooler.  Thanks, Lou.  It helps, man.  All right.  We got to get out of here, Anthony.  We do, do we?  Yes, we do, my friend.  Well, I hope everyone can try to have a good weekend.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm very glad it's Friday.  I really, I would not look forward to having to come in tomorrow and just deal with this again. 
[03:52:00]  All right.  We'll regroup, and we'll be back on Monday at 3.  Thanks, guys.  We appreciate all the phone calls and stuff, okay?  Yes.  And like we've been doing, I guess, a moment of silence for the victims, Anthony.  And then a quick song that we played earlier in the show for the victims and the rescuers, okay?  Right.  That's a cool way to end today.  We'll see you guys Monday at 3.  We'll see you next time. </pre>
