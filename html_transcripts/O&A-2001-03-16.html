<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about St. Patrick's Day, focusing on the absurdity of parades being held on Saturdays, the hosts' distaste for traditional Irish food, the prevalent drunken brawling in Irish pubs, and the police commissioner's ban on Krispy Kreme's free donut offer for those wearing green.  They also commented on Ron and Fez's possibly inebriated departure from their own show.  A brief call from Sean of MafiaMob.com, referencing a hidden "fish" and accruing points, was followed by an extensive segment on a photo contest showcasing women's buttocks, focusing on photographic technique and the potential for misinterpretations of images.  Stinkmeister's successful NCAA bracket predictions were also noted.

A caller, Tommy, inquired about the rules of the upcoming "musical dildo chairs" game, prompting a detailed, albeit vaguely worded, explanation to avoid censorship.  The preparations involved the arrival of the dildos (referred to as "apparati"), the female contestants, and the judges responsible for ensuring proper seating.  Comedian John Valby arrived late after taking a "nappy-doo" (nap) in the car provided by sponsor 1-800-GO-VITAL, having been kicked out earlier.  He joined the discussion and briefly described his upcoming performance.

Valby then performed several sexually explicit songs, repeatedly interrupted by the dump button (the censor).  These interruptions led to ongoing discussions about what words triggered the censor.  The broadcast continued with calls from listeners, sponsor segments (including a humorous, sexually suggestive segment with Dykes Lumber), further preparations for "musical dildo chairs," and updates on the "best ass" contest.  A caller described a chance encounter with a potential contestant for the ass contest, and the show played the FU line, featuring several angry and vulgar messages.

The bulk of the show focused on the "musical dildo chairs" game and the "best ass contest."  The significantly lower than expected number of female participants resulted in improvisation, including listener calls, discussions about the stock market's decline, and the introduction of a "whiffle ball bat challenge" as an alternative.  This challenge involved contestants (primarily women, but also a male contestant's wife) attempting to insert a lubricated condom onto a wiffle ball bat as far as possible, with detailed descriptions of each attempt and measurements provided.  Stockbroker Dave, a caller, donated $500 to the prize money, while other callers offered additional prizes or voiced disapproval.  Old Dirty Bastard made a surprise appearance in the studio, adding to the chaos.

Despite the initial shortage of participants, "musical dildo chairs" eventually commenced with four women: Claire (described as "Drunk Claire"), Nikki, Krista (the "whiffle ball bat challenge" record holder), and Gina.  The game, characterized by confusion over the rules, contestants' inebriation, and frequently falling "appliances," descended into chaos.  Nikki ultimately won the trip to WrestleMania and $250, Krista received $150 and Andrew Dice Clay tickets. The show concluded with the "FU Friday" segment, containing numerous profane listener-submitted messages. The entire broadcast was rife with crude humor, sexual innuendo, and offensive comments from the hosts and callers.  The WrestleMania trip and cash prizes (ranging from $250 for first to $100 for third) were the incentives for the "musical dildo chairs" competition.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O&A Show!  Okay, terrific.  Okay, horrific.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 is our phone number.  How's everyone today?  Very good.  Lots going on around here, huh?  Ron and Fez just wrapped up their fine radio program,  and now we're setting up some stuff for our fine radio program.  You know, I think they were intoxicated  when they walked down the hall leaving their program.  Ron and Fez? 
[00:00:30]  I think they were a little tipsy.  Look at that.  Same Paddy's Day, you know?  Everybody's getting all, what's that word, drunk?  Litter.  Yeah.  Get lit up.  Oh, by the way, tomorrow on a weekend.  Oh, my God.  That's Saturday.  That's insane.  That's unbelievable.  That parade's supposed to be held on like a Tuesday.  Yeah.  Not much could happen on a Tuesday.  Yeah, you know, but a Saturday?  Oh, it's not even like a Sunday where, you know,  you've got to go to work the next day, so you might... 
[00:01:00]  I could sleep it off!  Right, right, right.  By the way, good job with the music today, Ben.  Oh, yeah.  The Who doing The Seeker,  and, of course, U2 doing The Who before that.  Yeah.  From Irving Plaza.  Irving Plaza.  Is that, um...  Is that the little St. Paddy's Day thing you did there?  A little U2?  Yeah, he was working it a little bit there.  A little bit.  Sure.  Should have played some Chieftains, maybe, or...  Oh, yeah, the Chieftains. 
[00:01:30]  Or Black 47.  Oi!  I was talking to Ron before his show today,  and I said, you notice these Irish bands,  they all have, like, the same name for their band.  Oh, they're different names,  but they all sound like they could be the same names.  Right.  The Chieftains, the Charlatans.  The Cuncey Brothers.  The Cuncey Brothers.  Isn't that...  When you go into one of the bars, though, St. Paddy's Day,  and everyone's hammered,  and they've got the corned beef and cabbage,  and then the drunk Irish guy at the jukebox  playing Oh, Danny Boy. 
[00:02:00]  Is that necessary?  You've got to play that song.  Oh, Danny Boy.  Oh, shit.  I want to hear Puff the Magic Dragon.  And the TV morning shows,  because everyone's trying to get on to the,  you know, the Irish thing.  Yeah.  Their cooking segment this week was, like,  the fine Irish food.  Ah.  I got a bit of Irish in me.  Let me tell you something.  Well, there's nothing fine about the Irish food.  You don't like the corned beef and cabbage?  And I think it was CBS this morning,  one of those shows, 
[00:02:30]  they had a cooking segment,  and the guy was trying to make,  yeah, cabbage sound delicious.  Corned beef and cabbage is good stuff.  Oh, you get the mustard on there.  That is some good stuff.  Everything is boiled to the point  that it has no flavor.  And then you've got to throw the flavor back into it  with the horseradish for the mashed potatoes.  I like how everyone dresses in the green, though,  and they put on the little derby,  the green derby and stuff,  the plastic derby,  and walk around like,  hey, I'm Iris.  There's nothing better than being  in one of those great bars on St. Paddy's Day. 
[00:03:00]  That's it, man.  You've got to go to an Irish pub  on St. Paddy's Day  because the entertainment value alone,  you're bound to see five or six fights.  All brothers just going at it.  You're going to see that hot Irish girl  with the red hair  wearing the fire guy's cap.  She's so hammered now.  You will see that  in about 100 bars this weekend.  Yeah. 
[00:03:30]  Keith, a lot of arrests  on St. Paddy's Day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are some of the popular charges?  Yeah, that's on.  What are some of the popular charges?  Mostly drinking-related.  Drunk and disorderly kind of things.  Thanks, Captain Obvious.  Fighting.  Captain Obvious.  I thought you were going to give us something.  I like getting the police point of view.  What could possibly be different?  Are you guys pissed off  you can't get your free donuts? 
[00:04:00]  Did you hear about that?  Krispy Kreme wants to give the cops  and everybody,  if they have green on,  you go into a Krispy Kreme  and you get free donuts.  Right.  And then, what,  the police commissioner got?  Stepped in and said,  that's a bribe,  and if they accept it,  they'll be suspended immediately.  You should be able to give  your local cop  a cup of coffee  or a damn donut  without anyone,  you know,  raising their eyebrows.  Donuts?  It's not like you're giving  some proceeds  from shaking down  a drug dealer.  A perp.  That, by the way,  is allowed.  It's the donuts 
[00:04:30]  that they are from.  All right, so,  what a show we have today.  Yeah.  Sean.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Yeah,  Hammer Savage  from MafiaMob.com.  Hey.  That's 100 points right there.  You better fess up  and pay some people  a cut of that.  I'll be looking around.  Yeah,  did anybody find the fish yet?  Well,  it's starting to stink  and this person, 
[00:05:00]  I don't know,  maybe he just doesn't  bathe or something.  It's starting to smell.  I'm very surprised  that the fish is still hidden.  Yeah.  I'm going to take a nap,  Steve.  All right, Sean.  Peace.  Hang up on Mike  from MafiaMob.  Why?  Because now he'll get  100 points  and he gives me 50.  All right.  Is John Valby here yet?  There's one of  John Valby's  right-hand men.  Yeah,  pull him in here. 
[00:05:30]  Where's Mr. Valby?  Is he taking a snooze?  John is taking  a little nappy-do,  as he likes to call it.  Yeah,  he sleeps before the show.  Yeah.  He's doing a nappy-do?  Where?  Yeah,  we did,  downstairs in the nice car  you guys sent him.  Oh,  1-800-GO-VITAL.  1-800-GO-VITAL.  Yeah,  Mr. Anthony asked me  to please mention it.  1-800-GO-VITAL.  Go-VITAL.  So Valby's  out cold,  outside the studio?  Yeah,  we had a couple  earlier,  you know,  with lunch,  as he does.  And,  yeah,  he's just taking  a little nap,  but we're going down  to try to wake him up.  Hey, 
[00:06:00]  Ben,  you want to wake up  Valby like you did  last time?  That's always fun.  Yeah,  you get on the phone.  He wants us to do it.  No,  they'll be cruel.  Well,  that's when it's  snowing on your head.  That's true.  You want to go out there  and wake up Valby?  Does he need any more beer?  Yeah,  beer's always welcome  for John.  Yeah?  He loves his beer.  All right,  get him a beer.  And give us a call,  all right?  We're getting ready  for musical dildo chairs.  Musical dildo chairs.  It's going to be great.  We're waiting for like  the whole Ron and Fez show  to clear out  outside the studio 
[00:06:30]  and then we've got  to set up our stuff.  Yeah.  Do we have enough chairs?  Do we have enough  apparatuses?  I think so.  Apparat-i?  And apparati?  Apparat-i?  What was that other word  we were looking for?  There was apparatus,  appliance,  and dildo.  Dildo.  The dildo.  It was all work.  Yeah,  so we're going to play  musical dildo chairs.  Now the apparati  was supposed to arrive  at 2.30. 
[00:07:00]  Oh.  Is Rick around?  Let's find out.  And the ladies  are supposed to start arriving.  I'm getting nervous.  Yeah,  let's find out  what the deal is.  I want to make sure  this is going down today.  A lot of people  counting on today's shelf  are down  for entertainment purposes.  Right.  Hold on a second.  Anthony?  Oh, no.  Yes?  What's wrong?  Nothing.  I just told him  to get out of the car  because I've got to  send the guy on his way  and I've got another car  coming back at 5.  You're kicking  John Valvey out of his car?  He's taking a nappy do.  He wasn't sleeping. 
[00:07:30]  He was sitting up.  That's how he sleeps.  He was in the middle  of his nappy do.  You can't interrupt  the great John Valvey  when he's doing  his nappy do.  No, nappy do.  You told him  to get out of the car  because you need it?  Yes.  Who was so important  that he had to send the car?  Other limo companies  have more than one limo,  Anthony.  It's not a limo.  I sent him a town car.  Oh, last time's a limo.  This time's a town car.  He gets the bus next time, right?  He gets the bus.  He's working down to the bus.  Sorry.  All right. 
[00:08:00]  Thank you.  You got it, guys.  All right.  I guess John Valvey  will be in studio  very soon then.  He's done with his nappy do.  Nappy do.  Rick?  Rick, do we have dildos?  We need dildos.  Oh, my God.  No, they're going to be here  any minute.  Oh, my God.  You just hesitated.  They were supposed to be here  45 minutes ago.  Because our quote-unquote  supplier called up  and said she was running late.  Running late, but going to...  But going to be here any minute.  Well, if the mayor 
[00:08:30]  didn't shut down  all the sex shops  in Times Square,  we'd be able to just run out  and get them ourselves.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Any girls show up yet?  Oh, yeah.  We got four girls already  filling out the paperwork.  We got a contest.  We recommend it in Houston.  Four girls is all we need.  Four girls?  We want more to show up.  Oh, yeah.  All of you that want to show up,  show up for this.  That's right.  Yeah, plus, what do you call it?  Also, they have the opportunity,  the girls that are in the contest,  to jump into the ass contest.  Yeah, ass contest still going on. 
[00:09:00]  Cross promotion.  Yeah.  Most people dig in the pictures  so far at WNEW.com.  Mm-hmm.  They're not happy  with your photo technique, but...  Tell them to lick my ass.  All right.  Are we extending the ass contest yet?  Yes.  Extending the ass contest.  You know, the first day,  actually two days,  were a little slow.  But now it's picking up.  We're getting girls down here  for this thing.  Yeah, so, ladies,  you can show up next week as well  and show off what you got, okay?  And I like the picture quality better  than the first couple of pictures. 
[00:09:30]  Well, thank you.  I think Rick finally got the idea  that you can't just take a picture  of an ass  because the ass is a very fluid thing.  You know what I mean?  Well, a lot of people's asses  kind of look alike.  But it's got to go from back,  then ass,  and then into the thigh.  Right.  You've got to get the whole picture.  You can't just have an ass  or it's, you know,  it's a crack.  Yeah.  I think the ass picture  is too many close-ups.  Yeah.  We need to see a little more back,  a little more neck.  I got some side shots, 
[00:10:00]  some tummy  I tried to work in  with some of the girls.  But it's just like the breast contest.  We've got to work out the bugs.  Right.  See, that's nice.  There's a little pouch right there.  Let me see.  Look at that.  Let me see.  Someone was pointing out  one of the girls.  Look at pouch.  Ooh, look at that.  That's a fig.  What is that, a five-pounder?  Yeah, that's about a three.  Three-pounder?  Then look,  you've got the tendon right there,  the all-important tendon.  There's one picture  where we're not sure  if it's the girl's finger  or something popping out  of her...  It's a finger.  Are you sure?  Yeah.  Look at that. 
[00:10:30]  Did you get that shot?  Because I included  some tummy, some legs.  And go to the...  The side shot's really nice.  That looks like it was  made with a compass.  You know?  That is a very nice shot.  It's a good curve on that ass.  She has her hands on her knees.  That takes away from it  a little bit, I think, you know?  That was where Rick  was posing her like that.  Anthony.  Go to the picture in question.  Which one?  A bunch of listeners  emailed and said,  there's a little surprise.  Picture six.  Or contestant number...  Contestant number six.  Contestant six.  Contestant six.  All right. 
[00:11:00]  Picture one.  Let me look here.  You're saying that's a finger.  Oh, absolutely.  Let me see.  It's a finger.  There's a resolution on my screen  in the back office.  Dude, there's a nail on it.  Yeah, unless it's somebody  trying to climb out.  Yeah.  It wasn't that obvious  in the back office.  Now, a lot of people are saying that.  If you look at her hands  there in front,  she's kind of got them on her,  the front of her thighs  so you could see a finger.  I thought something  was popping out there.  No.  A little nibble.  She would need  immediate medical attention 
[00:11:30]  if that was something  popping out.  A little piece of gum.  A little piece of gum  coming out.  A little dentine.  A little dentine.  Shoot it.  Oh.  That ain't gonna...  All right, Stink.  Relax.  Stink is winning  the office pool  for the NCAA tournament.  Go Gonzaga and Butler.  Yeah, tell everyone.  They both won.  That's right.  Because everyone else  has pools out there.  Gonzaga wins  at least one game  every year.  Right.  You pick Gonzaga.  Gonzaga, yeah. 
[00:12:00]  Gonzaga.  Butler, Temple,  in Illinois.  Four for four today.  Look at you.  Wow, Stinkmeister.  And nine for 16  yesterday.  Look at you go.  Hey, the dildo guy  called up  and now he hung up.  Well, he's not a guy  so that's not  the right person.  Oh, okay.  Steve, what's up?  I just wanted to  say hi to you guys  and try to help the show.  Big fan of the show.  Thank you.  And if the apparatus  guy doesn't show up,  give me a call.  A volunteer being apparatus.  Oh, I see what you're thinking.  All right, bro. 
[00:12:30]  All righty then.  I'm over here.  Oops, sorry about that.  Tommy, you're next  on WNAW.  Yeah, how's it going, bro?  All right.  Listen, I want to hear  about the rules  and regulations  to this game,  to this dildo  musical chair game.  I mean,  well, Tommy,  it's very important  that you've been listening  the last couple of days  because we've got to  keep it pretty vague today  so we can get this  on the radio.  Yeah, I understand.  But basically,  it is what you're thinking  in your head.  Is there a rule  to which input  or they can go  either way?  Whatever the ladies decide. 
[00:13:00]  Wow, you guys are nuts.  All right.  I can't believe  you guys got this  on the radio.  You're great.  Tommy, let's just put it  this way.  We will have judges  to make sure  the girls sit properly.  Properly.  Right.  I see.  The contest has got to be fair.  On the airs contest  with the pictures,  are you going to get  some paint in there, too?  All right.  I see.  You've got to get  the whole angle.  You've got to get  like a three-dimensional thing,  though.  I'm looking at  Contestant 7,  Debra, right now,  and she's got an advantage  because she's using  the couch. 
[00:13:30]  Right.  Since when is the couch?  This girl is on her knee.  They could use  whatever props  in the area.  It's kind of,  I'm seeing things  in this picture.  I'm seeing things.  Turn around.  Turn around.  Look at this.  Now, that's nice.  That's like,  let me accept you.  That's nice.  She's a smart girl.  She could be a frontrunner.  That's pretty good posing.  This is a trip to Vegas.  I think before  the contest is over,  girls are going to be  taking off those panties.  Oh, Jesus.  Well, I had to get it  off the screen immediately. 
[00:14:00]  What happened?  I knew this would happen again.  No, they're all finalists, Anthony.  Right.  They're all finalists.  Wow.  Whoa.  Whoa.  All right.  What do we got there?  Let me see.  Take a quick look  or a close look.  There's some Majora  coming out of that one, huh?  That's a major,  major Majora.  Jeff, what's going on? 
[00:14:30]  Doing all night, man.  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey, what kind of music  are you guys going to play  with the musical chairs there?  Jeff, haven't you figured it out yet?  Well, how about some  Gettin' Lee or something, huh?  A little bit of Rush.  Rush.  We got John Valby.  John Valby's here.  He's the perfect guy  for this company.  Okay, well, in the background.  Party sounding.  A little bit of Gettin' Lee  in the background.  All right.  All dirty.  All dirty on there.  All right.  All right, man.  Thanks.  Bye.  I got to hang up on him  because look who's  outside the studio, man.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Just tell him,  we just want him to say hi.  He's picking up his clothes. 
[00:15:00]  The great John Valby.  Hey, there he is.  Look at you.  How are you?  How you been?  Good, real good.  How about you?  You got your laundry with you.  Well, yeah, they kicked me out.  Is that really true?  Our limo guy kicked you  out of the town car?  Yeah, they had to go  pick up somebody else, you know?  Oh, man.  Were you in the middle  of your nappy-doo?  I was.  I didn't even get  my first Budweiser yet.  Anthony from Vital  is banned now.  John, let me tell you something.  The one person you need  to remember in this whole studio 
[00:15:30]  because there's a lot  of people in here  is Ben.  He'll take care of you.  He'll take care of what you need.  There you go.  God bless America.  So you know  what we're doing today, John?  I heard rumors of it  last night in Jersey.  They were telling me  something about  they were going to be  sitting on...  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Musical dildo chairs.  We're just calling  musical dildo chairs.  It works like musical chairs.  When the music stops,  there's one less chair  than there are girls  going around  and they must sit down  in the chairs. 
[00:16:00]  As we do this?  Oh, yeah.  We're going to have  people like yourself  judging to make sure  they sit down properly.  Properly, let's just say.  Let's just put it that way, okay?  They have to sit properly.  And I can suggest  a little wiggle  as you go down.  Right.  Give me a little choke.  And it helped the judges.  We're all going to be able  to watch and judge  and make sure  they are sitting properly  in their seats.  And, John,  you've got a gig.  Where are you playing tonight?  Governors in Medford.  Medford.  Way out on the island.  Oh, that's out there, yeah. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It's going to be fun, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Love the shows.  Hey.  Go there a lot.  Been a fan for years.  All right.  Remember the old  Two-Ease Days.  Oh, East Setauka.  And, uh,  Manhattan, Stony Brook,  all those places.  I went the last time  I was in town,  Levittown Governors.  It was...  That was the night  with the donuts  in the parking lot  where you thought  I got arrested,  remember?  Right.  I did.  I thought you were  down for the count.  You saw me doing  the donuts, right?  Actually, I didn't.  No?  I was facing the other 
[00:17:00]  way in the truck,  you know,  and then I saw people  running out of the place  and saying,  oh, Opie's going  to get arrested.  You know,  they were freaking out.  Yeah.  It was...  Yeah, it was...  So, John calls me  the next day,  dude, you didn't get  arrested, did you?  Like, no,  thank God.  That was with that Lexus.  You turning your Lexus in?  I'm supposed to  turn it in today.  I haven't given it back.  I haven't given it back.  They got to come  and get it.  I'm not going  to turn it in.  Why am I turning it in?  See, they got to think  that's good advertising  for the Lexus  that you refuse  to give it back. 
[00:17:30]  Right.  You like it that much.  I am not giving back  the Lexus.  How funny.  Possession is 910.  How funny would it be  that they have to repo it?  They have to repo it.  I'm going to start hiding it.  I'll tell Jamaican Mike,  just stash it somewhere  in the garage  and tell him no.  He came in his truck.  There you go.  I don't know, man.  Bill, what's going on?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  What are the size  of these dildos?  Bill.  Yes, sir.  I've got to explain this  to you and everyone else.  Listen closely, everyone. 
[00:18:00]  We almost weren't allowed  to do today's show.  So you had to be listening  very closely  the last couple of days.  We're going to have to  keep it a little vaguer today.  All right.  I'm going to hang up  and go listen to myself.  But just use your imagination.  It's what we told you guys  the last couple of days.  Right.  It's musicals,  although chairs.  You know what's going on.  Figure it out.  What are you picturing  in your head?  Use your mind.  Right.  That's exactly what's  going to happen.  There you go.  Very good.  Good job.  Visualize it.  It's a headrest, Opie. 
[00:18:30]  That's what they're  being used for.  Headrest.  Picture it in your head.  John, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  John Valdez, big fan.  Saw you in 1982  in Connecticut  a long time ago.  Hey, listen.  Got a question for you.  Last time he was on,  you promised him  naked chicks on the couch.  Oh, we did promise you  something on the lesbian couch.  I think with the...  John's in the studio.  I think with the turnout  we are going to get today  with the girls,  I'd be amazed  if something doesn't  happen on the couch. 
[00:19:00]  John, we should pace ourselves.  What time do you have  to get out of here?  Because we want to do  the musical dildo chairs  and we want to make sure  we get some lesbian couch  stuff for you today.  You know, I was thinking  4.30, quarter to five,  something like that.  That five?  We could squeeze five?  We could squeeze five.  When's your first show  in Medford?  Eight o'clock.  Let's get a helicopter.  Yeah, it was tough.  I barely made the gig  last time  and that was only  out to 11.  Oh, that's because  we made you stay here  until seven.  I know. 
[00:19:30]  All right, we'll figure it out.  Okay.  Why don't we take a break, Anthony?  Yeah.  And we'll get the festivities  going, okay?  Absolutely.  All right.  212-757-1027.  We have the FU line.  We'll, I don't know,  we'll get into that next.  Believe it or not,  you're listening to the  number one afternoon  drive show in New York City.  Opie and Anthony.  1027-WNEW.  212-757-1027.  Musical dildo chairs 
[00:20:00]  to come.  Is there any kind of  jelly around?  It's all right.  Jelly?  You need some jelly.  Is there anything like that  laying around here?  We have some jelly.  All right.  Just making sure  a lot of people  are asking questions  for some reason.  If we have jelly,  I don't understand that.  Why?  I guess we got grape.  Why?  Why?  Are you hungry?  You need a...  Yeah, people are asking.  I was just wondering  and the answer is yes.  I guess we do.  So you don't need  a P&J or anything?  No.  That's fine.  You sure? 
[00:20:30]  Fine.  I'm good.  By the way,  so far,  three girls have showed up  for the musical  dildo chair game.  Uh-huh.  We're getting some ladies  calling saying  they want to be  a last-minute contestant.  Late entry.  Come on down.  If you can get here  within the hour,  fine, you're in.  Yeah.  All right?  We have a trip  to WrestleMania  for the winner.  And where is that  taking place?  In Houston.  Houston.  You got a little trip  to Houston, Texas.  It's very, very cool.  So come on down, okay?  Preview of summer  down there.  And John Valby  in the studio. 
[00:21:00]  Hey!  He's playing  Governors in Medford tonight.  Medford.  Medford.  Way out there  on Long Island.  Yeah.  If you're looking  for ticket info,  631-207-9212.  A couple people  just want to say  hi real fast.  Kyle, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey.  How you doing today?  Good.  I've been a fan  of Valby's for many years  and I never knew  his real name  and until he was  on your show  the last time,  I didn't know  his name was,  you know,  John Valby.  I knew him  was Dr. Dirty.  I wanted to know  if he has a tape out.  Tape?  A CD.  Yeah.  Excuse me,  a CD. 
[00:21:30]  When I saw him  at Levittown  and Governors,  one of his guys  goes,  hey, here's  John's latest stuff.  He dumped  literally 30 CDs  on my lap.  Did he really?  Oh, yeah.  You got so much stuff out.  Yeah, we got tons  of stuff.  Tons of stuff.  Wow.  And you could even  go on Napster.  Yeah, dude,  I got like 50 files  off of Napster from him,  but I can't find  this thing anywhere.  You know what?  I sell them  right where I play.  Yeah, if you go to  Governors of Medford,  you can pick up  some CDs.  No kidding, huh?  Yeah. 
[00:22:00]  All right, cool.  All right, bro.  All right, thanks, man.  Thank you.  Let's go to Frank.  Frank, what's going on?  Hey, Frank.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  All right.  Hey, I just want to say  I saw John Dalby  last night  at Stress Factory.  He killed.  He's the best.  It was the first time  for me and my wife,  another couple.  We had a great time,  and I got an autographed  CD there from him.  Wanted to thank him  for that.  Can't wait for the contest  later.  Do you need any more judges?  I can get there  in an hour.  Sorry. 
[00:22:30]  We might film  some of this stuff.  Oh, great.  You'll get to take a peek.  And tell John  to get down  to Rascals in Ocean.  That's right near me  where we can see him.  Easier.  All right, Frank.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You got it.  Let's go to Mark.  Mark, what's going on?  Mark?  Yeah.  Hey, what's up?  I just wanted to call  and congratulate you guys.  For having John Dalby here?  No, for doing what you do  and actually getting paid for it.  Yeah, I know.  I worked many years  to get where I am  and I felt really good.  And then I went  to your website. 
[00:23:00]  I'm fairly depressed.  If you ever need help,  I'm more than willing  to come work for you guys.  All right, Mark.  Thank you.  Have a good day, guys.  Cool.  Bye now.  Anthony, as we wait  for the girls,  we want to hear  some ditties  from John Dalby.  Of course.  Playing Governors  in Medford tonight.  Is that too loud?  I can't hear myself  too good,  but you can hear me, right?  Yeah.  Hey, yank.  My doodle,  it's a dandy.  Yank my doodle  till I die. 
[00:23:30]  Make that wiener  shoot some fireworks  just like the 4th of July.  I've had it since you  rubbed my thigh.  So yank my doodle  if you please  have my macaroni.  Yank my doodle,  it's so big,  baby, it's a dandy.  Stick that sucker  in your mouth,  you'll swear  it tastes like candy.  Yank my doodle  it's so big, baby, it's a dandy.  It's so big, baby, it's a dandy.  Yank my doodle  till I die. 
[00:24:00]  Lick my lizard  till it's standing.  Talk you.  Love yanky doodle  peckers.  I've got one  that I can spare.  So yank my doodle  till it comes  and point it  toward your boobies.  They say the stuff  is beauty cream.  Let's make  your boobies pretty.  My doodle  it's so big,  baby, it's a dandy.  Jerk that turk  and make a squirt  and keep a Kleenex handy.  Yank my doodle  it's a dandy. 
[00:24:30]  Yank my doodle  till I die.  All right.  Time out.  A little warmer upper.  A little warmer upper.  I think they just  burnt out the  dump button.  I said boobs  instead of the T-word.  Oh, wow.  Thanks for cleaning it up.  Jeez.  That must be it.  Yeah.  I don't think  they had a problem  with that.  Sick, how many times 
[00:25:00]  did they dump out?  They dumped it down  to like two seconds.  But he said  he cleaned it up.  I did.  I didn't use  any of the bad words.  What happened?  What happened?  It's a yank  and a doodle dandy.  Yeah.  It's an all-American  song.  How about  it's degradable  when your mom  finds out  your girlfriend  is inflatable. 
[00:25:30]  It's deplorable  but I find  her plastic sphincter  just adorable.  I admit it.  Our beaver  isn't furry  like a kitten.  You can imagine  the words.  I can  use  like her sister's  boobs.  You're just  inflatable.  You know it's  effing  but then  he uses  the x-word.  John,  John.  Well,  you know,  I knew  you were  going to 
[00:26:00]  bleep  one of  them.  You know?  Carefully  says effing  and then  says effing.  Phil from  Rocky Point  told the dump  got to leave  a little song  intact.  That sounded  like a crack  addict trying  to read  the New York  Times one ad.  Valby rules.  They dumped  six to seven  times.  Oh,  whiskey's  radio.  Oh,  man.  How about  when I'm  feeling blue  I whip  out my  magoo  and rub  its little  head 
[00:26:30]  till it  gets big  and red.  I tickle  the blue  vein  that runs  along the  shaft  until the  head goes  and gives  my thumb  a bath  wouldn't  you agree  my magoo  and me  have a  handy  kind  of  love  Yeah,  yeah,  now that's  fine.  Now,  does that  make it?  I don't know.  I don't know,  but it's  quite some  magoo. 
[00:27:00]  What the hell's  a magoo?  I don't know.  I don't know if  that made it.  I would love  to know what  the result is  there as far  as dumps go  because a  magoo?  Yeah.  One down.  One down.  In magoo?  In magoo?  But it's a magoo.  Why dump it at all?  He was talking  about a magoo.  One dump,  though.  One dump.  One dump's not bad.  By a dump,  do you mean you  lose the whole  thing or just  the one word?  You lose four  seconds.  Four seconds?  That's a lot.  Wow,  that is a lot.  It was a lot of  content.  Yeah, 
[00:27:30]  a lot of  That was a good  song,  the magoo.  This skips  more than  vinyl ever did.  I can't wait  to hear the  bleeped version  Saturday.  Right.  Wow,  you know,  I thought I  had carefully,  you know,  picked through  these and  used junk  whenever I  needed to.  Yeah.  Oops instead  of the T word.  Well,  you can.  You didn't  use the word  junk once yet.  Stick your  limp junk  right from  the dead.  They've got  knee pads  on their slips  and plenty 
[00:28:00]  of chapstick  for their lips.  Some like  the cornhole,  some like  the screw,  but I like  the ones  who'll slurp  out my goo.  Spin or  swallow,  I don't care  as long  as her head  is there.  At the end  of the month  most girls  will agree  it's time  for a little  tonsil.  You'll know  that you  can't get  much more  in.  So stand  up and  cheer for 
[00:28:30]  the girls  in the bar.  The ones  who suck  junk,  they know  who they  are.  Later on,  when we're  pumping goo,  we'll know  who they  are too.  Yeah.  Oh my  God.  Are we  still on  the air?  Why are  people running  down the  hall panicking?  Wow.  Rick,  how many  dumps that  time?  Wow,  it's amazing  when you  see one  of those  counters  just drop  to zero 
[00:29:00]  consistently.  I was  about three  or four.  It wasn't  as bad  though.  I don't  understand.  It's the  thoughts you're  censoring.  It's certainly  not the  words.  I know.  I think you  hit a couple  bad notes.  I think  that's  what  I don't  know.  Too  descriptive.  Oh,  is that  what they  say?  Too  descriptive.  Chin  and  balls.  You  can say  balls,  you just  can't say  what they're  doing.  Oh.  Isn't  that  stupid?  Let  me  see.  I  was  out 
[00:29:30]  on a  date  in my  daddy's  car.  I  picked  her  up  in  the  New  York  bar.  I  finger  effed  her  the  slit.  She  didn't  let  out  a  peep.  I  had  my  junk  in  her  throat  too  deep.  I  was  humping  her  face.  My  junk  started  to  spit.  The  doctor  said  the  bitch  had  an  epileptic  fit.  Well,  where,  oh, 
[00:30:00]  where  can  my  pecker  be?  The  bitch  bit it  right  off  of me.  Here  I  stand  with  two  balls  and  a  stump.  Please  FedEx  be my  pecker  when  you  take  your  neck  down.  Cha-cha-cha.  Now that  should have  made it.  Oh,  no.  You know,  John,  you're just  not learning.  What's up,  Rick?  Maybe the  dump guy 
[00:30:30]  was sleeping  on that one.  Oh,  yeah?  Or maybe  he just  ran out  of dumps.  Nice.  Went  through.  See,  that's good.  A lot of  that one  went through.  One,  maybe two  dumps.  What do  they say  on the  answer  of  feedback,  Anthony?  Tell the  dump  got to  stop.  He's  causing  a rip  in the  space-time  continuum.  When  did  hockey  become  a bad  word?  Yeah,  right.  And  tonsil,  I mean,  that's...  Tonsil  hockey?  What does  that mean?  Yeah.  Today's show  is going  to last  an hour  and a  half.  Van Halen 
[00:31:00]  on the  way.  When  they  finally  run  out  of  dump,  the  guy  turns  a  key,  presses  a  button,  and  it  do 
[00:31:30]  some  St.  Paddy's  Day.  You  know  any  Irish  songs?  It's  how I  spell  Irishman.  Get a  drunk,  he acts  just like  a  savage.  His  farts  smell  like  corned  beef  and  cabbage.  He'll  goose  you  with  the  old  shillelagh  stick.  He  looks  like  a  boiled  potato,  but  he's  really  a  stewed  tomato.  That's  an  Irishman  to  me.  That's 
[00:32:00]  probably  yeah,  yeah,  I don't  know.  Sticky,  how many  times have  we done  by now,  you know?  Up in  or?  Oh,  Mark,  that's  good.  How many  girls are we  up to  for the  contest?  I think  six.  Six?  Five or  six.  Oh,  oh,  oh,  oh,  oh,  oh,  good.  Do you  know what  might have  been that  one?  The  word  A-S-S-H-O-L-E? 
[00:32:30]  No,  no,  the guy's  name,  Dick,  you know?  Oh,  did I say  when it's  used as  a part  of anatomy,  that's the  problem.  You could  say,  like,  hey,  don't be  a dick.  Yeah.  Being used  like a  guy's  being a  jerk.  You know,  I just  I don't  face it.  I mean,  I've been  doing these  for years,  you know?  Keep  playing them.  I'm enjoying  them.  Once we  play it on  a Saturday,  people are  going to  love it.  You know,  I got a  new limerick  that I  really like,  and see if  you like it.  While eating,  can you say, 
[00:33:00]  while eating  a girl from  Iraq?  Yeah,  because you  could be  just  gaining on  her leg.  Maybe you're  into cannibalism.  Right.  While eating  a girl  from Iraq,  a buzz  interrupted  my snack.  Now,  this is,  of course,  because you  refuse to  enforce the  no-fly zone  just south  of her  crack.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  The old  man told  your sister  it was  pudding. 
[00:33:30]  I like  that one.  I wonder  if that  one made  it through.  It was  good up  until the  end.  No,  that's  fine.  You  think  it  made  it?  Yeah.  What's  wrong  with  pudding?  Your  sister's  beaver  has its  own  website,  penicillin.com.  I don't  know.  You're  doing fine.  All right. 
[00:34:00]  Boy,  why don't we  take a break  so we can  get some  more delay.  We'll build  up some  delay.  John  Valby in  the studio.  This is  going to  sound great  when we  put all  the bleeps  in it.  Oh,  yeah.  Don't  you worry  about it.  John  playing  Governor's  in Medford  tonight.  Rick,  did that  last one  make it,  that little  cute  limerick?  Yeah,  it was  fabulous.  Yeah.  You sure?  Instant  feedback,  yeah?  Was New  York  submerged by a  bit.  I don't  think  on the  last one  he saw  it more  from what  it was. 
[00:34:30]  It's art  form and  he let it  through.  Oh,  look at  that.  Art form.  My God.  But yeah,  we have a  few more  ladies just  showed up  for the  ladies.  How many  ladies so  far?  I think  we're up  to five.  Nice.  John,  what's  up?  Hey,  I think  the reason  why that  tune went  through was  because  a dump  guy  passed  out from  dehydration  and  overexhaustion.  I don't  think he  actually found  any aunt in  that.  I think  he's just  dead.  Very good.  You guys  suck. 
[00:35:00]  All right.  You guys  are doing a  show for  12 people  on hold.  Well,  yeah,  people are  requesting  they be  put on  hold so  they can  hear John  Valver.  Yeah.  Yeah,  Governor's  in Medford  tonight.  It's going  to be  great.  John  kicks ass  if you've  never seen  him live.  631-207-9212.  We'll take  a break,  Anthony,  and we'll  see where  we're at.

[00:42:30]  I was up on 57th.  I pulled over on 57th and  7th.  I'm standing at the  little hot dog stand  guide.  Oh, I know where you  are.  Yeah.  Right.  There was a guy in  front of me, and I'm  standing there waiting,  and this girl comes down,  climbing from about 50  feet down the block.  Gorgeous, with these  tight blue jeans.  All I saw was camel toe  coming up the block.  She pulls over.  She says,  excuse me, could you  tell me where 888 is?  I'm looking for WNEW.  Oh, yay.  I pointed her in the  direction, jumped back  in the truck, couldn't  wait to get home.  I still can't figure out 
[00:43:00]  which one she is.  Well, the pictures that  Rick are taking, that  Rick's taking right now,  it's going to be about a  half hour before the  rep on the other side.  This was yesterday.  The girl had these blue  jeans on, black leather  jacket, black pants, but  she was gorgeous.  That could be Debra.  I think that's who it  was, but I said, I  got to thank these guys.  It was unbelievable.  Oh, cool, man.  Guys, thanks a lot.  Enjoy it.  All right, Mark.  Thank you.  Take care, guys.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  All right, so the  apparati are here. 
[00:43:30]  How many girls are in  for the contest?  It's getting confusing.  Some girls are here  for their shots.  Like I said, I think  we're at five for the  musical dildo chairs  for the trip to  WrestleMania.  And a couple girls,  I understand, through  the phone lines have  called and said they're  on their way.  They're just running  a little late.  Good.  All right, so we'll  stall another, like,  20 minutes and we'll  get the festivities  going, okay?  Yeah, and what about  the Ask Contest girls?  Do you have any more  than just that one  out there?  No, we just finished  up those three girls.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  And anybody else 
[00:44:00]  who wants to come by?  Okay.  Why don't you film?  Should we bring the  girls in?  You might want to  just bring them in  and say hi.  That's pretty much  what we do with  the Ask Contest girls.  Yes.  Yes.  There goes the  apparatus, huh?  Yeah, a little  background music.  Nice, ladies, hello.  Hi, girls.  How did the photo shoot go?  Went well.  Do you feel it went well?  Well, I have to see.  You've got to see the 
[00:44:30]  pictures.  I've got to see it first.  What's your name?  Jessie.  Jessie, and you are?  Nikki.  Nikki.  Where are you guys from?  I'm from Queens.  Was Nikki the  nervous one?  Yes, very nervous.  She's not as nervous  with her clothes on.  Yeah.  Now, I heard that Nikki,  your boyfriend,  made you do this?  Yeah, he did.  You actually,  did you want to do this?  He listens to you guys  all the time.  Did you want to do this?  Well, I really want  to go to WrestleMania.  Okay.  Well, I'm here for that.  And Anthony, what I saw?  Wait, you are going  to participate in the  musical dildo chair thing? 
[00:45:00]  I don't know what's  wrong with the beer.  Oh, you're wrong.  I was asking them for beer.  They wouldn't give it to me, though.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  No, just heroin or crack.  That beer will kill you.  Did everyone show  John their butts?  John, did you see  all the girls' butts?  I got to see Nikki's butt.  You know John Balby?  Hello, how are you?  John Balby, man.  He's really famous.  Would you like to hear  one of his songs?  Oh, sure.  Okay.  Okay, how about  at least someone will.  Yeah, I'll be thinking  you're about one day.  I began to stir about  Down came my pants  To let the pecker out 
[00:45:30]  Out came the playboy matches  In my hand again  Da-da-la-dum  Da-da-la-dum  My itsy-bitsy  Oh, god  And messed my favorite shirt  Out came my puppy  who licked it up and then  My itsy bitsy penis was in my pants again.  If any of that made it, I am stunned. 
[00:46:00]  Stupified.  You can't say penis?  Give me that.  All right, I'll let you in on a few more rules.  John, I'll let you in on a few more rules.  Okay.  Yeah, go ahead.  You could use the word penis.  You're talking about it.  You cannot describe what it looks like.  Or what it's doing.  Why would you say itsy bitsy?  That's not even a compliment.  Well, it's kind of a play on itsy bitsy spiders, you know.  John, look at how old she is. 
[00:46:30]  And don't you know that most guys actually do have itsy bitsy penises?  Not the ones I've seen.  Did you like with an ass like that?  I can tell you why.  Did you like his song?  I do, I do.  But it's very interesting.  Can we see your butt?  Yeah, because you guys missed.  We missed it.  All right.  All right.  Where do I stand?  Stand right there.  How about right on the table, yeah.  Oh, yay. 
[00:47:00]  There she goes.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  A little butterfly tattoo there, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Bravo.  Damn.  I missed it.  Yeah, you did.  Oh, that was good.  Unfortunately, right?  All right.  Let's go to Mike and see what Mike has.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, John Valby.  Hey, thanks.  What's going on, man?  You did that song a long time ago.  It was about Mickey the Nick from MafiaMob.com.  Hanging up on all that. 
[00:47:30]  I'm dumping out.  So he gets nothing.  Getting too inside with the MafiaMob.com.  Right.  Let's go to John.  John, what's going on?  Hey, you know, I called before, but I've been listening to the radio.  It sounds like Morse code going out over the radio.  It don't sound like tunes.  Yeah, I know.  John is learning as he goes here.  I think I got an SOS.  I think you guys might be thinking.  Be careful.  I think he got a bit of brain damage since the last time he was here, because last time 
[00:48:00]  we got more of his songs on the radio.  Yeah, I know.  It's taken.  What happened, John?  Let me try this one and see.  There's none of those words in here, so it's got to be good.  They're gooey and they're itchy.  They make your girlfriend bitchy.  They hide right in her snitchy.  The herpes family.  Yadda la da.  Yadda la da.  Yadda la da.  Yadda la da.  Yadda la da. 
[00:48:30]  And you can hardly see them.  But when you start a-peeing, they really make you scream.  It's the herpes family.  Yadda la da da.  Yadda la da.  Yeah, no, nothing should have gotten bleeped there.  Did that make it?  Did that make it?  That's fine.  John Valby playing Governor is in Medford tonight.  I think it's sold out, but if it's not, give them a call.  631-207-9212, right?  Yes.  It made it?  All the way through.  All the way.  Yeah, a whole song. 
[00:49:00]  A whole song.  And we made it the whole way.  Wow.  I'm so sorry.  And last time I was here, I told you, all of these songs that I do, I've done them in Boston.  They haven't bleeped a damn thing.  Wow.  That's Boston.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And so, you know, they're a lot freer up there.  I mean, it'sy-bitsy penis.  How innocent can you get?  That's pretty innocent.  Yeah.  But who's that now back there?  It was innocent until you started describing what that it'sy-bitsy thing was doing.  Oh, she came for a reshoot. 
[00:49:30]  For a reshoot.  Oh, okay.  Are you doing the musical chairs today?  No, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  I wish I could.  No?  Wow.  She wishes she could.  Well, why don't you just stay then?  I wish I could.  I really have, you know, prior obligations, but it sounds like a lot of fun.  You guys are having a great time.  Yeah, we got a trip to WrestleMania for grabs and everything.  I know, but Vegas will be enough for me.  Okay.  All right.  I think she's going to win the best ass contest.  You're that confident, aren't you?  All right.  Let's go to Bob.  Bob, what's going on? 
[00:50:00]  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Good.  John Valby, man.  He used to play a song.  I heard it.  I downloaded it off Napster.  It's about Bill Klan.  It was sung to the tune from The Wizard of Oz, If I Only Had a Brain.  Are you familiar with the song I'm talking about?  Yeah.  Would you be able to play it?  Well, is it clean, Bob?  What is that?  Is it clean?  All except for one word where he's referring to a Hummer, but he's calling it something else.  Ah.  As far as this guy is concerned, it's clean. 
[00:50:30]  If I could get myself a job, deny it with a snow job or some story I'd invent, blah,  blah, blah.  Right.  And so forth.  Right.  Love that song.  So if you remember it, John, you can play it, man.  Yeah.  Come out to Medford.  No, I mean, they're really cutting back.  You know, let me try this now.  It's just a series of words, and none of them are the bad words.  Okay?  All right.  All right.  Let's try this one.  Give it a try.  Scuzz, fuzz, nipple juice, viagra, swollen junk.  Look, rump riding, colon cowboy, squealing like a chick. 
[00:51:00]  Your girls buy their rubbers by the effing case.  I like that.  At this point, I don't know what made it.  I don't even know what made it on that one.  I would say, yeah, that's fine.  Yeah.  I wouldn't have dumped one thing.  And I didn't.  Look.  Huh?  Oh, you can't say that. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, God.  Isn't that awful?  Come on.  I'm getting...  Oh, yeah.  It should be able to play whatever the hell we want.  I know.  It's innocent stuff.  It's fun.  It's fun.  Let's go to Buckshot.  Buckshot, what's up?  How you doing?  One dump on that, Ben?  Buckshot.  How you doing?  All right.  What's going on, eh?  I wanted to see if maybe he could send it out and smoke signal so we could understand it.  Also, John. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  I want to see if he could do the eat night, bite night, gobble.  No, that one I know he can't, too, unfortunately.  No.  Why not?  He can't do the rest of them anyway.  Take it easy, guys.  All right.  Bye.  Thanks, Buckshot.  All right.  Unbelievable.  I can't believe, like, some of the stuff they're dumping out of them.  Yeah.  Man, me neither.  Want to try one more there, John, or what?  Sure.  Yeah, let me see.  I'm, uh...  Let me... 
[00:52:30]  Can you say masturbate?  Ah, that's a new one.  That's a new bad word.  That's a bad one?  What's the content?  I could masturbate for hours, urinate on flowers, beat it on a rock.  It could watch me while I'm shaving at the girls.  It would be waving if I only had a junk.  It would junk just like a froggy, make my blue jeans soggy, unless I wore a jock. 
[00:53:00]  And I swear I'd never eat her.  I would always use my teeter if I only had a junk.  A junk.  Picture this, our legs apart, the fragrance of a cootie fart.  We'd bang right on the floor, then up it'd pop for more.  I would air it out on Sundays, I'd even change my undies, whack it round the clock. 
[00:53:30]  And I would always use a rubber whenever I F your mutter if I only had a junk.  It doesn't quite rhyme.  Yeah, it doesn't quite rhyme there, but I think it got through.  I hope it got through.  Jim, what's up? 
[00:54:00]  What's up, guys?  I just want to thank you.  I'm on my way to Connecticut to see my woman.  Yeah.  And go out for St. Paddy's Day.  Yeah.  This has been the best, funniest ride I ever had to Connecticut.  Funniest?  Yes, we haven't got any songs on the radio yet.  We've got pieces of songs.  I've seen Don many a times already.  Oh, cool.  And it's been a blast every time.  All right, Jim.  Thank you.  Thank you, guys.  Bye.  Bye.  All right.  We should take a break.  Fifteen minutes away from starting off musical.  Dildo Chairs, Anthony.  Very psyched, very excited. 
[00:54:30]  A lot of the girls here looking forward to it.  Do you have any strategies?  You're playing, though, right?  Yeah.  Any strategy you think you're going to use for this?  Got to be quick.  Got to be quick.  Yeah.  Well, you've got to be quick to win this game.  I really want to go.  You really want to go to WrestleMania in Houston.  If I have to throw elbows, you know.  Oh, yeah.

[00:56:30]  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Lots going on today, Anthony.  John Balby in the studio.  He's got to get out of here in about 20 minutes.  He's playing Governors in Medford tonight.  Way out there next to England.  So far east.  Going to have fun, though.  Great show.  Check them out.  Medford tonight.  Governors.  So we have that.  We have girls stopping by for the Best Ass Contest.  Mm-hmm.  And the grand finale today is, of course, musical dildo chairs. 
[00:57:00]  Musical dildo chairs.  We've got some girls for it.  More coming down?  Yeah, that's the problem.  We want to start in like 10 minutes, but a bunch of girls have called saying, hey, we're  on our way.  Please don't start the contest.  So we're trying to stall people saying, and we will stall, ladies.  So, you know, hurry up and get down here, okay?  Guys asking if they could be fluff guys for the girls, so it's a little easier.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Because they've got the fluff girls for the porno movies to help the guys out. 
[00:57:30]  So they wanted to know if they could come down here and, uh...  And the answer, no.  You guys are just as bad as I am.  I'm just using the wrong damn word.  It's all how you lay it out.  See, everyone knew what I was talking about.  Took a bleep on that one.  I just dumped myself on.  That wasn't me.  That wasn't me.  I was asking you that time, yeah.  Let me try this one, okay?  This is a short one.  Okay.  The room is spinning. 
[00:58:00]  We're close to death.  The checkout lady.  She held her breath.  My cheeks came apart.  Right there in Kmart.  I cut a cheese fart.  The floor was sticky.  Out came the waxers.  The store detective brought out the crackers.  I said, gosh, gee whiz.  Come get free cheese whiz. 
[00:58:30]  Right there in Kmart.  Woo!  Yeah, no problem.  That had to make it.  No problem on that one.  How about me?  Oh, I'm George W. Bush.  The economy's falling apart.  The stock market's about as healthy as my vice president's heart.  Since I moved to D.C., Monica's become my latest squeeze.  I just hope that cow don't give me foot and mouth. 
[00:59:00]  I had to get my Monica in there.  I love Monica.  I'd pop that bitch.  I swear to God.  See, pop that bitch.  I think he could say that.  Yeah.  John, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Yeah, you're John.  Yeah.  You remember when you did Conan O'Brien?  What did I?  No, I don't.  What did I do?  You did a jail song.  I think it was called He Almost Looks Like You. 
[00:59:30]  You're going to have to give me another shot of something.  I don't remember.  Sorry, man.  All right, John.  We're trying.  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  Later.  Also, by the way, yes, ladies, last minute contestants will take them for the musical chair game.  Feel free.  This is for a trip to a WrestleMania.  We have enough to play the game, but more would be nice.  Oh, sure.  We had 30 girls saying, I swear I'm coming down for this.  Yeah.  And we didn't get 30, so. 
[01:00:00]  No, I don't think John's going to be able to play the music.  Well, because he has to get out to bed.  Because he's got to go.  But now, what kind of music?  Huh?  What kind of music are we going to use?  We'll figure that out.  That's easy.  We need some lousy, like, kiddie party music.  Yeah, we'll get that.  Jack in the Box music.  We'll get that stuff going.  Yeah.  Maybe some Olsen twins music.  Blue schools, maybe.  Doing this would be great.  Girls walking.  Picture the girls.  He's walking around.  He and you make my junk squirt. 
[01:00:30]  That's what it's all about.  That'd be great.  Put your right boob in.  Put your right boob out.  Right.  It'd be perfect, you know.  Yeah.  I'd be running to the door to swatch them, you know.  They just stop the music and they got to find their seat.  Yeah.  You could cancel your gig tonight, right?  The hell with it.  I'll stay for a while.  Really, really, think of it this way.  I have one of the few jobs, they can't start without me.  That's true.  Yeah.  They got away.  So if I'm a half hour late, I'm a half hour late. 
[01:01:00]  It's worth it.  I want to see these girls go down on these chairs.  On the chairs, of course.  Yeah, the chairs.  You know, this one, there's no dirty words.  I know it won't get bleeped, but it's really a dirty thought.  Okay.  Okay.  Give it a try.  You can tell by the smell that she isn't feeling well  As the end of the mud rolls around  You should be a little wary if she serves a bloody Mary  As the end of the mud rolls around  Oh, hi, hi, what you got to say? 
[01:01:30]  Shout out your orders out and clear  We got super regular large  Rags to fit a barge  As the end of the mud rolls around  Oh, you can tell by the slime  She's a week ahead of time  Here's one of my favorites  You can tell by the taste  Another egg has gone to waste  At the end of the mud rolls around  Oh, hi, hi, what you got to say? 
[01:02:00]  Shout out your orders out and clear  We got super regular large  Rags to fit a barge  At the end of the mud rolls  Oh, you want to try some semi-sick ones here now?  Oh, let's try  Let's go  Oh, you can squeeze her cotton pony  Get some sauce for macaroni  How about when your dog starts to howl  She needs a sanitary towel  Oh, you want to hear my favorite one here? 
[01:02:30]  Yeah  Yeah  From the slugs in her flow  You'll think you're eating escargot  Yeah  But it's great  When your favorite date  Called you up and said  Honey, my period ain't late  At the end of  At the end of the mud  Roll around  Nice 
[01:03:00]  Now that had to make the radio  Of course  It wasn't even talking about anything  I don't know what it was talking about  And that's much worse than any of the other songs  I know  It just doesn't make sense  Right, John?  I know  I think we ought to have some kind of formal protest to the FCC  I don't want you guys to lose your job, though  All right, Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  I've been a John Volby fan for about 15 years  Yeah  He might be able to get away with Knock Knock  The real old one  Yeah, we could do some of that  All right, we'll try that

Hey  When I was in college  I don't know if Mr. Valby remembers it  1988 or so  He was supposed to come up  To Binghamton, New York  There was mad protests on campus  Did he ever make it?  No, I didn't make it  In fact, I got within about a mile of the campus 
[01:09:30]  And the cops intercepted me  And took me to a little stronghold  What was the problem?  In two colleges  They passed around lyrics  You know, just taking a racist song  Out of context  And saying I was a racist  And they didn't want this on campus  And all these people  Who were protesting  Had never heard me  And you know  When I do races  I do all the races  Right, yeah  But they took it out of context  And they had bomb threats  And they had all this kind of stuff  So the school just gave me the check 
[01:10:00]  And sent me home  You know  Wow, yeah  Somebody did that  If they take things out of context  Of course  Oh, yeah  Which song was it?  It might have been  Oh, how did this change into an organ?  Wow, Yanni in the studio  That's pretty  Yeah, we're going to have to find  How the old one went  Here  Anybody know where it was?

Lady  Well, this Lady Di girl  This stalker of the show that calls up  Oh  She tried coming in in leather pants one day  And it had to look better on the cow  I don't understand why they even sacrificed the poor cow for that  Because the cow wore it a lot better than she did 
[01:14:30]  She's supposed to go to the road show  And then she's calling up saying  I can't make it  Can you reschedule?

[01:17:00]  No, you're doing much better now  Thank you, you know?  I think we beat the dump guy into submission  The C word, I think  The S word  Oh, the S-E-M-E-N?  Yeah, that's  That's a C  Yeah  Right, right  That's usually good if you're talking about naval operations  And crews of ships and submarines  But the second you start talking about it going anywhere  Oh, then they got a problem  Could you say  Clinically, you could use it  No 
[01:17:30]  I don't believe you could say that either, John  I'm sure that's being snipped down the hall as we speak  Oh, that's a good one, though  Yeah, the C-O-M-E word  Uh-huh  You know, like come here  When it's used in another context, can't be used at all  Can't be used at all  In any way, shape, or form  So we like to use words like man chowder  Things like that  Your sister thinks man chowder is a topping choice? 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, but now it sounds like a topping choice  What's fun about that?  Yeah  Yeah  We're all learning, aren't we?  We are  All right, why don't we take a break?  We're going to have to get John Valby out of here very soon  Yeah  He's playing governors in Medford  Hearing rumors the shows are sold out, but I'm not sure  You might want to give them a call ahead of time  631-207-9212  Okay, Anthony?

[01:25:30]  You're supposed to talk to you  Oh  It's our show, you fool.  I can't go off. 
[01:26:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Come on, it's not funny anymore.  You can stop.  You can stop.  You can stop.  Red and A-B-W-W.  Got to thank Drew Boogie for sending that one in this weekend. 
[01:26:30]  That's good.  That's some good stuff.  Trying to relate to our listener.  Hope you're another bloodbath.  Why are you laughing, old 30?  You?  Sorry, I was going to say quickly, another Wall Street bloodbath.  Dow below 10,000, lost 207 today.  NASDAQ at 1890 now.  Happy days are here again.  The sky's up above.  Wah, wah, wah.  Remember that?  Remember like a year ago? 
[01:27:00]  A little over a year ago, everyone was all happy and stuff.  NASDAQ.  Everybody's gardener was in the market using E-Trade.  The ups guy was?  Everybody that was coming in here, everyone you bumped into was talking stocks because everyone  was in it.  And now, I mean, it's just pushed out everybody that...  A year ago, almost to the day, it was over 5,000.  Right.  And now it's below 2,000.  Now it's 1890.  And the Dow is below 10,000 now.  Dow's below 10,000. 
[01:27:30]  Just a massacre.  I see some buying opportunities.  No, no.  No, I don't see any buying opportunities for quite a while.  I see nothing because I put an answer in my eyes.  I thought that yesterday, and I'm down an extra 1,500 today because I thought yesterday was  the buying opportunity.  Stupid.  You're so stupid.  They say an unexpected rise in consumer sentiment dampened hopes.  But unexpected rise in consumer sentiment?  Hello?  What the hell does that mean? 
[01:28:00]  All I know is you look around, people are feeling a little shaky about the economy.  What the hell is...  What was Bush out of his mind to even run?  You saw it during the campaigning that it was kind of wasn't as strong as it was a year  ago.  Like...  You know what, though?  Like his pop.  Like father, like son.  Like his pop.  Republicans will lose again in four years, not for any other reason, but the economy is  going to go and take a downturn.  And all the Democrats are going to go, see?  We told you, but if Gore was in, it would be doing the same thing. 
[01:28:30]  Because the president hasn't affected anything right now.  Yeah, if Gore was in office, the economy would be doing exactly what it's doing now.  Well, who gets elected president?  It affects the way people...  Nah, nah, nah.  It's all business.  It has nothing to do with the figurehead.  It's a totally different department.  The business end of the United States runs itself.  It's what it is.  And right now, it's on a downswing.  It just happened to be on an upswing during the Clinton administration.  So you think waiting for them Florida votes, you know, didn't do anything like that?  Nothing to do with it at all. 
[01:29:00]  It's just, it's all cyclical, you know?  It just kind of goes up and down.  Now we're going into a down, and it's just going to get uglier.  Anthony, that's all cute and stuff, but Alan is going to say something that a lot of people  are wondering right now.  Alan?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Why the hell are you stalling for this contest?  Okay, he's on to us.  Come on, guys.  Hey, can I tell...  Nope.  Old Dirty.  Can they hit us?  What?  Old Dirty, what is wrong with you?  Old Dirty. 
[01:29:30]  What is wrong with you?  What?  What is wrong with you?  You freaking...  You a madman?  You're like a madman.  What?  Yeah, I only had one drink.  I'm already flip mode.  Flip mode?  Yo, my flip mode squad.  Flip mode.  All right, should we...  You can hear me.  What are we going to...  Shut up!  God, I was ready to defend you today, too, because there's like three calls going,  why is O.D. in the studio?  I have a problem when O.D. is here. 
[01:30:00]  Why O.D. again?  I was going to say, because we like having them around, and you almost wrecked our contest.  Yeah.  I apologize.  All right.  I said heifers in a good way, because heifers means hamburgers, dude.  Holy S.  Mike is off.  Mike is off.  The shorties.  Anyone want to hit O.D. Erty?  Feel free.  Hopefully he hasn't had a nightstick to the head in a while. 
[01:30:30]  Let me take care of that.  Yeah, go ahead.  Keith, hit him.  Anthony?  Yeah.  We should be honest with our listeners and explain what the hell's going on here.  Oh, no.  Okay.  All right.  Some people might have noticed.  We've turned around, and we're heading back to the airport.  I don't want to alarm anybody, but it seems our number two engine has flamed out. 
[01:31:00]  It's okay.  We can fly on one engine.  It should get us back to the airport, but we thought we'd be honest with you.  Hey, what's that?  A number one engine?  What's that like?  Okay.  Nothing to worry about.  I'm sure a number one engine's just fine.  That smoke is nothing.  Nothing at all.  I think we can save this, though.  If we're honest with our listeners, I think we can save this.  Okay.  Here's some honesty.  Opie?  I was being honest. 
[01:31:30]  Shut up!  Opie, what seems to be...  Well, we want to play our musical dildo chair game.  Musical dildo chairs.  I'm hanging up on a bunch of people.  Don't get pissed, but I'm trying to clear the line so we can get on to some other things here, okay?  Yeah.  No, we're not making the interns play.  We don't have any female interns, Rick.  Chris, what's up?  Listen, I'm going 20 miles an hour on Route 80 in the slow lane waiting for you guys to play this contest. 
[01:32:00]  Oh, see?  All right.  All right, hold on, Chris.  All right.  All right.  Well, when we announced the contest earlier this week, we had...  How many women call us, Rick?  How many?  How many?  We had a page and a half of about 25 names.  25 girls.  Home numbers, swearing.  So excited.  They're like, yes, I definitely want to be there.  Tell us what day.  25 girls that sounded very excited to come down, play musical dildo chairs for a trip to WWF WrestleMania in Houston, Texas. 
[01:32:30]  Great, great prize, obviously.  And we even said, ladies, if you don't plan on coming down here, then don't waste our time.  Then don't waste our time and don't call and say you're going to be here.  25 girls called up.  And then Rick took that list of 25 names and confirmed.  Stinky and I have been hammering the phones the last two days, confirming.  I think we had...  Stinky, how many did we end up having?  Like 12 to 15 confirmed?  Yeah, 12 confirmed and three maybes.  Okay. 
[01:33:00]  12 confirmed and three maybes.  So, okay, so it started out with 25 girls down to 12 or 15.  Still could do the contest, right?  Sure.  Supposed to do it today.  Rick, how many girls are waiting to play musical...  Dildo chairs.  How many girls waiting to play?  Well, we have 30 apparatuses.  Just in case, because you never know, there could be a rush at the last minute.  Rick, how many girls are waiting to play?  At this point, each girl can take 10 of those home. 
[01:33:30]  So, doing some quick...  Okay, hold on, hold on, because a lot of people are screaming at their steering wheel right now.  I understand.  But let's remember the day we were supposed to do...  Mommy, you know, what would you do for NSYNC tickets?  That completely fell apart in front of our eyes.  And we ended up having one of the best bits ever.  Yes, but when Zebra's in the house, you can't always depend on Led Zeppelin dropping by.  That day it happened.  But right now, we're working with Zebra.  I have faith that we could pull this one out of our you-know-what's. 
[01:34:00]  Who's behind the door?  I have an answer to that.  No one.  I've been wasting my time.  Three girls.  Three girls.  Three girls.  Three.  Alex.  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  Yo, when are the girls coming out?  I'm falling asleep over here.  Oh, Christ.  He's killing us.  So now we have to decide what to do.  Well, let's bring the girls in.  Let's bring the girls in.  Let's bring the girls in that we have out here.  Ladies, grab some mics. 
[01:34:30]  Grab some mics.  Yeah, come on in.  Grab some microphones.  Oh, my God.  Mine is pissed at me.  Now.  Now.  Yeah, grab that mic there.  Now, obviously.  Let us play.  Hold on one sec.  Hold on one sec.  We could obviously solve this problem if just a few more ladies showed up.  We only need a few more.  Three is good to play.  Let us play.  Well, we're working on just getting a couple of more girls down.  I'll wait, but I want to play.  All right.  I see. 
[01:35:00]  That is cool.  Very good.  Very good.  Look at her practicing.  All right.  I like the enthusiasm.  I have been practicing on my musical chair.  I like the enthusiasm.  Thank you.  All right.  Listen.  Yeah.  Well, if we play with the three, we're going to have to make it a little more interesting  is what I'm thinking.  In what way?  How?  I don't know.  Lead penis?  I guess I'm reaching out to our listeners here.  I'm just in the bathroom with you.  Yeah.  We were in the bathroom together.  All right.  Who's who?  Oh, yeah.  Krista.  Hi, Krista.  Claire.  Claire. 
[01:35:30]  I talked to you.  Hi.  And Nikki.  And Nikki, who was also in the Best Ass Contest.  Beautiful ass.  Beautiful ass.  And her pictures are now up on WNAW.com.  Yes.  All right.  And you girls are very excited to play musical dildo chairs.  Very.  Yes, we are.  We're ready to go.  I'm going to get my tickets.  And they want to go to the Wrestlemania.  We're all dying to get those tickets.  We want to win.  I feel bad for them.  You're getting to her.  And you want to go to Wrestlemania, obviously.  Yes, we do.  You know, we just need a couple of more contestants.  Please.  To fill out the... 
[01:36:00]  Girls, what's wrong with you?  I don't understand why we don't have ten girls, at least, down here.  I'm hanging up on a lot of people.  Don't get pissed because we're trying to get a few more girls.  Doesn't every girl have a girl at home?  What is the problem?  What are you all, pussies?  She used it properly.  Yes.  Rick is suggesting best two out of three.  All right.  See, musical chairs, everyone remembers when we were kids.  You play with ten or twelve of your friends at a birthday party, not three girls. 
[01:36:30]  Right.  Yeah.  That's a game that will last 30 seconds.  I know.  The brave must succeed.  It's two rounds.  That's all it is.  Two times walking around.  Five minutes, maybe?  It's ridiculous.  I know.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let me talk to Uncle John.  Uncle John, we need your help today.  Hey, guys.  Just an idea.  Instead of single elimination, make it like quintuple elimination.  Whoever's left standing has to be left standing five times.  That's a little too many.  Oh.  Uncle John, we were so excited. 
[01:37:00]  We figured we'd do this with, like, 20 girls.  I know, man.  I was psyched for this.  Yeah.  Well, it's not over yet.  I know.  I have faith in you guys.  We'll pull it out of the hat.  We're professionals.  We'll figure something out.  Of course.  Of course.  Bunch of pussies.  Come on down.  What's wrong with these girls?  I want the girls.  Claire, you might be scaring the ladies.  I'm sorry.  You're coming on a little too strong.  Maybe we got some dainty little girls coming down here.  Oh, yeah.  Dainty girls want to play musical dildo chairs.  Of course they do.  Yeah.  Look at Nikki.  Yeah.  Look at Nikki.  She's scared.  She didn't wear a skirt, though. 
[01:37:30]  She's our friend now.  Yeah, it's okay.  But you girls, yeah, they wore skirts and everything.  They're ready.  We're ready to go.  See?  They're all ready to play.  We are.  We so want to play.  Nikki, how do you plan on playing?  They gave me a t-shirt.  Oh, they did?  Yeah, either that or cut a hole in the arm.  Where the arms go and then, like, wear toga kind of sort of thing.  Oh, there you go.  What is wrong with you girls?  Did you guys try to recruit some of the ass contestants?  Yeah, she tried all the way.  Oh, absolutely.  They're not in there, huh?  They are not going for it.  We figure we just need two more girls.  That's it.  I know.  Maybe three. 
[01:38:00]  I know.  Three would be key.  And there were a bunch of girls calling saying, no, I'm on my way.  I swear, I swear, I'm on my way.  Yeah, on my way.  But now, at this point, we're pretty much telling our listeners that it's not looking good right  No, it's a little shaky.  I'll go to the 20 confirmed, no?  Where are you girls?  What are you afraid of?  Oh, okay.  Claire, have you been to check it all afternoon?  Let's relax a little bit.  Last time I heard, it was four on the way here, and then...  And that's about three more cents.  Can we put a wig on Old Dirty or something? 
[01:38:30]  Oh, no doubt.  With Gay Marco.  He wanted to play.  No, that's okay.  Come on.  My boyfriend was saying he'd play for WrestleMania second.  There you go.  No, no, maybe on Mad Max's radio show.  What's the name if they're going for that input?  Don't throw something.  Okay.  That's a little, little...  Any girls calling, any...  All right, hold on.  I'm going to turn your mics down for a second, because we've got to talk to stockbroker Dave. 
[01:39:00]  Dave, what's up?  I got an idea.  Of what, Dave?  Get the whiffle ball bat.  Whoever does the most of the whiffle ball bat, I'll even throw in 500 bucks.  All right, hold on.  All right, hold on.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  Dave, what, were you short today?  I'm in a bit of mood, Ed.  Well, you're getting 500 bucks.  You called it right.  I'm in a bit of mood, Ed.  Look at you.  Look at the difference in the voice.  Dave called it a little right today, I guess.  No, nobody was yelling at me today. 
[01:39:30]  Dave, I'm thinking if we can count on your, you know, Winstockbroker Dave Cash, I think we'll get a few more girls down here.  Hope, I'm a friend of the show, whatever you need.  Cash is always good, the ladies will say.  Cash is king.  Cash is king.  But they've got to go for the whiffle ball bat record.  Fine.  Look, fine.  Wow, are we ready to break that out of the case?  It's been sitting on the shelf.  Go get the whiffle ball bat.  And there's a box of condoms up there, too. 
[01:40:00]  That's good.  Well, we don't want the girls.  Hygienic.  Of course.  This could be a little warm-up.  A little warm-up while we wait for any more girls to come down for the musical dildo chairs.  We'll do the whiffle ball bat challenge.  Ladies, a trip to WrestleMania up for grabs.  Yes, Rick?  Is this what they call, in case of emergency, breaking the glass?  Yeah, that's exactly what it is.  Explain the whiffle ball bat.  Hold on, Claire.  It used to be just a whiffle ball bat that we'd keep in the office, and no one wanted to really touch it.  But now there's been a case.  Who is that?  Keith made it? 
[01:40:30]  Keith made it, yeah.  Keith got us a case for it.  It's a glass case with a wood base, and it sits proudly in our office just waiting for the next time it's called upon for the whiffle ball bat challenge.  It hasn't been used yet, this whiffle ball bat.  No.  It's a brand-new whiffle ball bat.  Capital Custom Glass in Farmingdale.  They helped me out with that.  Very good.  A plug for the whiffle ball bat challenge.  Bat case.  I swear to God, you would think it was Babe Ruth's bat up there at the Baseball Hall of Fame. 
[01:41:00]  I think he's going to get the bat.  Claire wants in on the record.  Yeah.  Dave, so maybe we'll throw some cash into this contest, too, huh?  500 bucks to the winner.  God, how much did you make today?  You want to do that, or, you know, more girls would come down and feel better about it if second place was a cash prize?  Yeah, whatever you want, kid.  All right, you want to do that?  First prize is the trip to WrestleMania.  But even if you don't win, second prize, Stockbroker Dave's 500 bucks since he had some short stocks today. 
[01:41:30]  They'll really...  And I think they'll really get into the contest if they win the trip to WrestleMania and the $500 for spending money, man.  That's a huge, huge prize.  You think so?  Do you want to do it that way?  And then we've got some stuff laying around the tournament.  How about 300 plus the trip and then 200 for a second?  Because now you're going to get girls that will come down because I don't even have to win.  I'm going to walk away with some.  Okay.  All right.  We'll take that.  Never again.  What about the wiffle ball bat?  Oh, the wiffle ball bat's right here.  All right.  Hold on.  Before we do the wiffle ball bat challenge, let's just beg the ladies. 
[01:42:00]  Ladies.  Okay.  Here's a good begging.  We need someone to take one for the team and girls and come down to the station.  You've got to be close, obviously, because we're running out of time and help us make musical dildo chairs successful today.  Girls, if we've ever made you laugh.  Why don't you?  If you've ever been driving, maybe we got you through a tough time.  We never ask for paybacks, really, but we're asking right now.  Right.  You want to do it that way?  I like that, too. 
[01:42:30]  Okay.  First prize, $250 plus the trip.  Second prize, $150.  Third.  Now prize is up to third place, $100.  That means every lady in the contest.  Right here, now every lady would walk away with something.  Would walk away with something.  But now we need other girls to come in.  Oh, that adds up to $500.  Thanks.  I don't want to sound like Jerry Lewis.  Go over the consolation.  No, we're begging, Opie.  We are begging.  Let's not candy poke this.  We are begging right now.  Are we going to have to roll out the kid with just a head? 
[01:43:00]  Don't make us do that.  Don't make us sing You'll Never Walk Alone.  Help us out.  Where's Ed McMahon?  All right.  Do you want to do the Whiffle Ball Bat Challenge, Claire?  Sure.  I have a question.  Yeah.  Our husband slash boyfriend is allowed to help with the Whiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  Well, well.  My husband standing right there wants to help.  Yeah, that's fine.  That's fine.  I'm fine on my own.  Why not?  My boyfriend likes to watch.  All right.  We got a Sharpie and we got a Whiffle Ball Bat.  Dave, you want to listen on the phone or you want to just go?  Just tell me how to play because I don't know. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, whatever you want, Kate.  I'll go.  Oh, let's do it on the radio.  All right.  Yeah, let's do it on the radio.  Send my cash.  I'll get it to you on Monday.  All right.  Cool.  All right, Dave.  Have a good weekend, boys.  Later, man.  Dave, congratulations today.  Love you, boys.  That was great.  Love you.  He sounds so much better.  The only man in Manhattan that made money on the stock market.  He bet on the downside.  You got to love it.  Okay.  I'm going to do this.  All right.  Open up that glass container.  Let's get the bat going.  There it is.  Look, it's coming out. 
[01:44:00]  It's out of the cage.  Hey, Stinky, march around the studio with it.  Look at him.  Yeah, yeah.  March around the studio with the Whiffle Ball.  There it is.  Stinky displaying the bat for everyone.  What a presentation.  That's it.  Very nice.  It's right on there.  Whiffle Ball bat.  I feel like I'm looking at Joe DiMaggio's bat.  Isn't that something?  Very nice.  A nice new Whiffle Ball bat.  All right.  Who's going first?  Me.  Oh, my goodness.  All right.  Put on a Lifestyles ribbed lubricated condom. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, God.  On the Whiffle Ball bat.  Well, they can come in and check this out.  What the hell?  There you go.  Anthony's still patiently waiting for a few more ladies to show up.  Ladies, please, we're begging.  Come down for musical dildo chairs.  A trip to WrestleMania up for grabs.  And cash prizes.  And cash prizes, yes.  She's doing this now, though.  Yes.  Yeah, just to...  Does that mean she wins this prize?  No, this is just a side thing.  Oh, no, this is a side thing. 
[01:45:00]  This is a very impressive record to have.  Right.  The Whiffle Ball bat challenge.  Yes.  This is setting a new standard today.  At the end of the year, we do give away a prize for the person that was able to set  the record on the Whiffle Ball bat.  Yeah.  Nice.  Wait, wait.  Stink.  Stink.  Oh, that's fine.  Is she using that...  She's using that end?  What end?  Which end?  Handle you.  Handle you, idiot.  Well, which end do you think?  Which end do you think?  Stinky.  She's a little rigid. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, that looks a little uncomfortable.  Yeah, yeah.  Just go with the smooth end.  All right.  Okay.  That's all right.  Oh, okay.  What's the matter, Ro?  It's not ribbed on that, though.  All right.  Yes, what a day.  Stinky for sport here.  The Whiffle Ball bat challenge underway.  Stinky's putting gloves on.  Stinky getting the gloves on.  The, um... 
[01:46:00]  I got a fabulous picture of Stinky rolling, rolling the condom.  Good.  The condom on the Whiffle Ball bat.  And for the first time in quite a while, we are going to have the Whiffle Ball bat challenge.  There you go.  You got to put a little of that on there.  Where are we going?  Where are we going over here?  Everyone's got to get a good view.  Yeah, we're going on the counter there.  All right.  Who's got the official Sharpie to mark off the bat? 
[01:46:30]  Stinky, is that your job?  Stinky lubing the bat up.  Very good job.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Got the gloves on.  Just like Pintar.  Yeah.  Now, remember, this is a game of distance, not time.  So you can take your time, however long it takes, and really, really work it to try to  set the mark as high as you can. 
[01:47:00]  Sounds good.  All right.  Let's get that mark up high.  The Whiffle Ball bat challenge.  Stinky making his way over to Claire.  Okay.  With the bat.  The boyfriend.  The boyfriend.  Do you want gloves?  Over there.  Hold on.  I need gloves.  Hold on.  Should we switch mics?  This chick, he doesn't need gloves.  Do I need a mic or no?  The mic's on over there.  Maybe a lower mic would be good for the sound effect.  Yeah.  Back her up into the corner.  Oh.  Go right into that corner there.  Where's the old record on that? 
[01:47:30]  Ant, this is a brand new bat for the new year.  No one's done this.  Where's the old record?  There's no, it's wiped out.  There's no old record.  Oh, look at that.  She is setting the benchmark right now.  Anthony.  We're doing this.  Anthony, just for the record, Jamaican mic in the studio.  Jamaica mic.  Let's see.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  Yeah.  There we go.  Okay, now.  All right.  Hold on.  Now, okay.  She's starting.  Wait.  No, no.  Hold on.  No one knows what's going on. 
[01:48:00]  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  You're threading it.  I've got to like, you know.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Hold on.  Is there enough?  No.  All right.  You tell him.  Oh, my God.  Don't say anything.  Hold on.  Hold on.  No one knows what's going on.  Leave that corner.  What the hell is she doing?  Opie, I'm seeing a real contender here.  Okay.  Are you comfortable?  Are you comfortable?  More.  More.  I feel I've never felt better.  More.  More.  More.  More. 
[01:48:30]  More.  More.  More.  Oh, my God.  My kidneys are collapsing.  Be gentle.  You just say win.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Win.  All right.  Mark it.  Mark it.  Mark it.  Thank you.  All right.  It's marked.  Slowly.  Off the court.  All right.  Slowly.  Oh, my God. 
[01:49:00]  You've got to be kidding me.  Oh, my caliber.  Wow.  There is a benchmark.  That is a benchmark set.  And now the next person.  Hey, Stink.  Using your bare hands, huh?  Stink.  Stink, he just used it.  He has a gloved hand, and he started using the.  Should we have Claire sign the back? 
[01:49:30]  Because I don't think anyone's going to break that.  I don't know.  Now it goes back in the case.  Make sure that mark's on there, Stink.  You can scratch it in, you know, with a key or something.  That's a good mark.  We can handle the bat more.  Is that a good mark?  Now, initial the mark.  Let me go to Lexi.  Lexi, what's up?  Hey, you guys, you ended up not having enough girls.  No, we're still looking for a few girls to come down.  It's not too late.  Well, listen.  You know that Brian Regan, he's like the best person to ask about musical chairs. 
[01:50:00]  Maybe you should ask him to call up and make an appeal or something.  Thanks, Lexi.  I thought you were coming down.  I don't know if I can now because I'm all the way in Westchester.  All right.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  It is signed.  Now put that back in the case unless somebody else wants to try.  Anthony, it's time to beg again really fast while the next girl gets wrong.  Ladies, ladies, we're begging.  This is pathetic, but we know we have to do this.  We only have three girls for this contest. 
[01:50:30]  We need more.  A couple more girls.  We have a trip to WrestleMania in Houston, Texas.  Cash prizes for down to third place.  Yeah, we have 250 for first, 150 for second, and 100 for third.  Plus, first place.  We'll also get to WrestleMania in Houston, Texas.  So, ladies, please, if you want to come down, time is of the essence.  Give us a call quickly, and then come down.  Oh, yeah.  We're begging, too, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  Come down.  John, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  And to help out a little bit, as a fourth place consolation prize, I'll cover either dinner 
[01:51:00]  for two at Paisano's or two tickets to a future Rastal show.  There you go.  No, we got to Paisano.  Dinner for two at Paisano.  Paisano.  Nice.  I'm over and free.  I'll cover two tickets to a Rastal show to get girls in the studio.  All right.  Thank you.  Oh, we're getting an official measurement?  Okay, guys.  All right.  All right.  Get the official measurement, Rick.  This is Claire.  Uh-oh.  Rick?  Five and three quarters.  Five and three quarters off of the bat. 
[01:51:30]  Let me see.  But it is the wide end.  It's wide.  Yeah.  I did take the wide end.  Wow.  Look at that.  She rode high on the bat.  There you go.  All right.  Put the bat.  Does anybody else want to try?  Stink, where's the official mark?  Do you have to mark it again?  Did you scratch it, Tarno?  Yeah, I'm going to do that.  Yeah, we'll scratch it in there.  All right.  Stink's got gloves on.  Of course.  It don't work.  Who's going to try to beat that record?  Anyone trying now to beat the record?  Anyone?  Anyone? 
[01:52:00]  Where?  Krista.  That's part of the room, because I don't know anything.  Krista, come here.  You could.  I looked uncomfortable.  No.  You could.  Hey.  I will be very comfortable.  All right.  Wait.  Get on the mic.  Get on the mic.  We're great at this.  Come here.  No.  Get on the mic.  Get on the mic.  So we can talk to you.  You don't.  She's obviously not.  She's not shy.  Yeah.  I'm not really that shy either.  But, I mean, you could turn around and face the wall or something.  As long as somebody can confirm. 
[01:52:30]  That's all.  I was thinking about that.  Yeah, because there's literally 30, 40 people checking it out.  So.  Yeah.  You mentioned I was drinking all afternoon.  Yes.  It's not natural lack of shyness.  Well, as long as somebody can look and confirm where it is and make the mark.  That's all we do.  You don't have to.  You don't have to.  Go for it, Krista.  Huh?  That's your husband.  Can he do that?  Yeah.  Of course.  Well, Stink's just got to mark the bat.  That's all we do.  Stink's got to mark the bat.  He's the official judge.  Look at Stink.  He takes his job very seriously.  Look at him.  He's engraving the bat right now. 
[01:53:00]  He's engraving it.  Good job.  Yeah, sure.  Go for it.  All right.  Stink, he must mark the bat.  All right.  He's going to do it.  Sure, why not?  Okay.  Get it set up again, Stink.  All right.  Why don't we take a break, Anthony?  All right.  And we'll come back with another wiffle ball bat challenge as we wait.  And hopefully get more girls for musical dildo chairs.  You want to, yeah, why don't you give it the hard sell real fast.  Ladies, we're begging.  We have three girls for this.  We need at least five, hopefully six. 
[01:53:30]  So we need two or three more girls to come down.  There's cash prizes and a trip to WrestleMania in Houston, Texas for the winner.  And we have cash for the second and third place people, too, so you don't even have to win.  Come down.  Please, we're begging.  This is the Opian Anthony F.U. Friday line.  Yeah, I just want to say f*** you to all you damn Chinese people that get on the B train in Grand Street with all your bags of smelly-ass raw fish.  Yeah, f*** you for making me smell that s*** all day, every day on my way home.  Thanks. 
[01:54:00]  Next message.  Hey, guys, I just want to leave a huge F.U.  To the saddest, ugliest couple I've ever known in my life.  That being my best friend, his fat, ugly, stupid, sad-teafed girlfriend.  I hope they die.  Please, God, don't allow these couples to procreate.  Because retards would have smarter and better-looking children.  F.U., guys.  F.U.  So, next message.  This is a big F.U.  To all people who call St. Patrick's Day, St. Paddy's Day. 
[01:54:30]  Being St. Patrick was the patron saint of Ireland.  And Paddy, the big derogatory, is like calling an Irishman a nigger.  End of message.  All right, we're having fun in here today.  Anthony, we had a couple girls call there on their way.  That's what I hear.  We've heard that old gag, so.  If you guys want to stick around to hear musical dildo chairs, great. 
[01:55:00]  But this isn't any clever ploy by your pals to make you listen longer.  We honestly don't know if these girls that said they're on their way will show.  We sure hope so.  But if I was a betting man, I would say before the show's over, we're doing musical dildo chairs.  I'm feeling confident.  How did the girls sound?  Stinky, did you take the calls?  One of them.  And how did they sound?  This one girl, Gina, sounded very excited. 
[01:55:30]  She was about ten minutes away.  Stinky, can I ask you a favor?  When you're wearing the glove, you're touching.  Wait.  It's a new glove.  It's a new glove.  I saw when you put it on, you still handled the bat to put it away.  No, no, no.  I took it off.  I put a new glove on, ready for the next connection.  That has had no contact whatsoever with the bat.  Look, there's nothing on it.  Look at it.  He's so psyched to have the glove on.  Do you feel important right now?  I just got to ask you, you know.  No.  Don't.  All right.  How about the hand that you used to take the condom off the bat barehanded? 
[01:56:00]  Have you washed that hand yet?  I had two gloves on when I handled it.  No, no.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  I saw you hold the bat with the gloved hand and reach for the base of the condom with your bare hands.  And I said, oh, using your bare hand?  And then you switched.  Now, you haven't washed your hands.  No.  And you're touching things.  Here you go.  Thank you.  Give me my pen.  But I touched what didn't go in.  No, no.  Look.  Close enough. 
[01:56:30]  Close enough.  Just like hand grenades.  Close enough.  All right.  I'm not saying anybody has anything.  But, you know, we don't want to take those chances.  Safety first.  Safety first and always.  Anthony?  Yes, sir.  It's been almost ten minutes since we've begged.  You want more begging?  Yeah, you want to take this one?  Girls, please.  We want to do musical dildo chairs.  We really do.  We have three girls that are totally willing to do it.  We need at least two, preferably three more girls to come down and do this. 
[01:57:00]  First prize, of course, WrestleMania in Houston, Texas.  A trip to Houston.  Plus $250 spending money.  Second place, $150.  And third place, $100.  So, you're going to walk away with something if you're first, second, or third place.  Right.  So, please, come down.  Play a fun party game.  Your pals are begging at this point. 
[01:57:30]  Look at us.  I'm not too proud to beg.  All right, why don't we get Krista?  Her name's Krista.  She wants to try the wiffle ball bat challenge.  Round two.  She's got to be five and three-quarter inches.  Five and three-quarters, Claire did.  But that is a fat bat.  You know what I mean?  Krista, you all right?  Yes, I'm fine.  What's wrong?  And the wiffle ball bat's big, too.  She seems bummed out.  Make my boots.  Got nice boots.  Thank you, Kevin. 
[01:58:00]  What did you say?  Because I missed it in.  Whisper it in.  Review the tape later, Opie.  We have the...  Is it good?  ...wiffle ball bat challenge coming in.  Kevin's cracking up.  How good was it?  Was it good?  Pat yourself on the back.  Was that good?  Okay.  All right, Krista, are you ready?  Kind of, yeah, sure.  We'll do whatever it takes.  I mean, you can face the wall.  We don't care.  Squatting.  Huh?  Squatting. 
[01:58:30]  Squatting?  Oh, yeah, hey, sure.  Whatever technique you want to use.  Anyway, we're just waiting for Dr. Stinky to put his gloves on, because he has to mark.  That's the only thing we ask.  Oh, boy.  You all right?  Yeah, I'm fine.  Is that your husband?  That's my husband.  Yeah, what's up, Opie?  And I think...  Are you cool with this?  Yeah, I'm down with it.  Whatever.  All right.  All right.  I've asked him about ten times.  Something worse, though.  You think he could beat five and three quarters?  I'd like to know what that is.  That's with me.  You think he could beat five and three quarters?  I would vouch for it.  Oh, yeah? 
[01:59:00]  Oh, look at this.  Look at this.  Any side bets going on or anything?  I don't know.  Can you up the prize for the other one?  Yeah, this is an exhibition, believe it or not.  Yeah, this is...  Yeah, it's not an official event in the Olympics yet.  It does end up with a prize.  We keep tabs on everybody's name and mark, and at the end of the year, we have a big prize  for whoever wins during the course of the year.  And considering you guys are the first contestants we've had this year, there's a good chance no 
[01:59:30]  one else will do this.  It's kind of a hard sell, if you know what I mean.  Does that make me feel a little bit better?  Yeah.  I think he is preparing the bet.  And look, he's wiping his eyes with his gloved hand.  Oh, my goodness.  Look at him go.  I think he's over there like he just ate Kentucky Fried Chicken.  Yeah, finger licking good.  Yeah.  He's prepping the bat. 
[02:00:00]  Much like the gymnast that rosins up the hands, Opie, or the stretching that goes on  for a racer, a marathon runner, or a sprinter.  The bat must be prepared for this event.  I think he's jacking the bat.  He's holding it in a very provocative way and jacking it.  And Steve C. is...  Breaking me.  Okay.  Did you break it?  No.  Pretty rough. 
[02:00:30]  Make sure it is really prepared with a lot of that stuff that you put on it.  Yeah, there you go.  There you go.  That's it.  There you go.  Put a lot on it.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's a little too good at this.  There you go.  Not too much friction.  Very good.  Okay.  I think we're ready.  Chris, are you ready?  I'm getting there.  Here we go.  Daryl, are you ready?  Yes, I'm getting there.  Let's get ready to Whiffle Ball Bat Challenge! 
[02:01:00]  All right, where am I going?  Batter up.  Batter up.  Speaking of the bat boy.  We've got to move over, I think, Daryl.  Watch it with the camera.  No camera.  No camera.  Okay.  That's fair enough.  Give me a microphone.  New York skankies.  Oh, I don't know.  Somewhere like this.  Over.  Over.  There's not so many.  That was the line?  No.  Oh, okay.  Opie? 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  I said...  You guys can all look through the window, though.  I said, yeah, but that's a pretty fat bat.  And I said, and the Whiffle Ball Bat's big, too.  Oh, no, no.  You guys can come over.  Whatever, Ben.  You're lying.  I'm doing it, eh?  Yeah, come on, Chris.  So you can do this.  And you want to move over?  Surprisingly, you're just going to sit where you are, huh?  Well, I think I got a good view, as long as Rick stays out of the way.  All right.  She's going to try a different technique, can't we?  Yeah, Rick, go to that side. 
[02:02:00]  There you go.  Now I have a good view to call the action.  All right.  And the boyfriend's got to kind of go sideways a little so we can call the action.  We do that?  There we go.  That's fine.  That's perfect.  All right.  All right.  Wait.  I've got to move over.  Kev, if you want to back up a little.  Move over to this.  All right.  So...  All right.  The bat is going on the floor, right?  You're going to put the bat on the floor?  Uh-oh.  The base of the bat.  Now she has complete control over the bat.  Am I a little practice for us as long? 
[02:02:30]  I don't need practice.  You guys aren't going to start making...  Oh, look, look.  Ah.  A little kiss before they go.  That's good.  You can do it.  He's like the coach.  This is the most romantic thing I've ever seen in the studio.  Here we go.  Is that going to work?  There we go.  She has to explain to him what...  Hey, listen, buddy.  What the...  Am, what's going on over there?  You got an HVAC shirt on. 
[02:03:00]  You should know how to lay some pipes.  Make it like you're running a line set.  Got it?  Somebody on the other side.  Pull it through.  Pull it.  All right.  Hold up.  Okay.  Don't describe what's going on.  Don't describe.  Just go with the noises.  Stand up.  There you go.  Okay.  Whoa.  Look at that.  Okay.  Hey, hey, hey.  Oh, my God.  It's come up underneath a Japanese trawler.  Don't let her fall over. 
[02:03:30]  No, I'm right.  Oh, kind of.  I'm trying.  Hold on tight.  Oh, my God.  She's grabbing the wall really hard.  That's it?  All right.  Hold it.  Hold on.  Hold it with your finger and then mark it.  I didn't know Dr. Sig was down there.  The whole thing is ready, willing and able to mark.  I don't even know where this marks is.  Is it marked?  Do you want me to mark it for you?  Put your finger where it is and then mark it.  Hurry up.  You know what I mean.  He can roll it up with his thumb. 
[02:04:00]  Dude, I'm not cheating.  I swear to God.  All right, dude.  All right, dude.  Okay, slow.  All right, slow.  All right.  And...  Beep.  Beep.  Beep.  Beep.  Right there.  Right there.  Wow.  Let's see.  Wow.  You beat the mark.  Beat it.  By like...  What's this note?  Match.  Where is it?  Up there?  Rematch.  Rematch.  Rematch.  Oh, my God. 
[02:04:30]  No.  Rematch.  A rematch.  Claire wants one more shot at it.  This is like McGuire and Sosa going out.  Yeah, see?  And take one more.  That's the bat.  Wait a minute.  Yes.  Dr. Stinky.  What was it?  Holy cow.  Almost by an inch further, too.  Oh, my God.  Almost by an inch.  Wow.  Stinky.  Bravo.  Do we have the tape measure?  All right, Rick, with the official measurement. 
[02:05:00]  What's the official?  Six and a half.  Yeah.  Six and a half.  6.5.  Dave, there we go.  Stinky, you want to go get us lunch now with your gloves on or something?  Another girl has arrived for musical Dildo Chairs.  Yeah.  Bravo.  All right, we're preparing the bat. 
[02:05:30]  Claire wants another shot at the record.  When it gets to eight, sell.  Claire only had the record for ten minutes, Anthony.  Ten minutes.  Quick record right there.  Where's the new contestant?  Where's the new contestant?  Bring in the new contestant so we can thank her.  Take a look at this one.  What?  Hello, darling.  Holy Jesus.  Hi.  Hello.  You rock.  What's your name?  How are you?  Gina.  Fine.  Hi, Gina.  How are you? 
[02:06:00]  You're ready to play?  Sure.  Why not?  We got a trip to WrestleMania.  You know that, right?  Oh, it's my boyfriend.  I don't care.  All right.  That's all right.  All right.  And, well, just in case, even if you don't win, there's cash prizes for first and second.  Yeah, take that.  And third place.  And third place.  And third place.  That's good.  Bravo.  Well, thanks for coming down.  See, I knew our begging would pay off, Opie.  We need one more girl at least, if not two.  Is that the boyfriend?  Yeah, that's him.  What's your name, bro?  Hey, Jason.  Jason.  Thanks for helping us out today.  Good job.  All right. 
[02:06:30]  Good job.  Are we preparing the bat for Claire's attempt to beat the record that was just set?  The last contestant signing her marked her.  Rick.  The world record.  Okay.  I'm getting, with the door open, I'm getting, like, this feedback-y thing.  Why don't you turn the monitor down out there so we can talk in here without it feeding  back.  Anthony, if you ruin this, I'm going to kick your ass.  I don't ruin anything.  All right.  I have my ducks in a row before I open my yapper.  All right. 
[02:07:00]  Hey, Ant.  Yeah.  Yeah.  HVAC?  Mechanic?  I'm certified, you know.  Yeah?  Hell yeah.  All right.  I could, uh, I could do everything.  I will not lose.  I'll bring my effing tools.  Dr. Stinky is preparing the bat for Claire.  Where's Claire?  I'm here, Vince.  Claire, she kicked your ass.  Hi.  I know.  I know.  Got you by, uh, childbirth.  Huh?  I mean, she's, I just talked, I just talked to Krista.  She had a baby.  I have never given birth. 
[02:07:30]  But I am willing to take yet one more for the team.  All right.  Nice.  Nice.  Yes.  I will.  Where's G.I. Joe?  There he is.  A ball-peen hammer.  A ball-peen hammer.  That's my ball.  I like him.  He's all right.  And he's great.  All right.  You guys think you can set this or what?  What did he say?  What did he say?  We're going to work on it.  It's like a nail in a dirty wall.  I have to hammer it in like a Nazi on heroin.  And I'll win.  Bye.  Bye.  These two are out of their court, man. 
[02:08:00]  Okay.  Terrific.  We like that, though.  Look at Ben.  Ben doesn't laugh this hard, usually.  Whatever, Ben.  Okay.  Terrific.  Okay.  Horrific.  Okay.  Terrific.  All right, Claire.  All right.  Everybody, Stinky, preparing the bat again.  You're getting pretty good at this.  You need more lube.  I'm ready.  I'm ready for Stinky, baby.  Take it out.  Well, no.  We're using the other place. 
[02:08:30]  File hack.  The thing is, Stinky, car breaks like it's file hack.  Come here, baby.  I'm ready for you.  Outbreak.  Oh, my God.  Right so much.  This is such an ugly scene.  This is great.  You're not right.  Calm down, man.  This is great.  This is so wrong.  But it feels so right.  All right.  Hey, Jamaican Mike, where are you?  Where's Jamaica Mike?  Right here.  Right here.  Jamaican Mike, what do you think of this bat stuff, huh?  This is nothing, right? 
[02:09:00]  Nothing.  Six and a half inches.  It's my new friend.  Farty boy.  Hey, that's all you can take.  Six and a half.  I'm terrified of Jamaican Mike's hair.  Well, let me tell you something.  That's all you can take.  From what you were able to do with that bat.  That's not good enough for me, baby.  That's not good enough for Jamaican Mike.  I know.  I bet that's why I'm terrified.  Jamaican Mike, we'd have to do the tree stump challenge.  I'm ready.  I'm ready.  All right.  All right.  Stinky.  All right.  Hey, Stinky's disgusted at this point. 
[02:09:30]  He is completely disgusted.  All right.  Let's get back in position.  Okay.  Oh, look at that.  He's applying something to his hand.  I believe he's going to...  Sink cream.  A little preparation.  Of course.  A little area prep, Opie.  Not only bat prep, some area prep.  I see that.  He's trying to clap.  Yeah, look.  He's trying to clap.  What are you doing in there?  I swear to God, it looks like Predator...  He's clapping! 
[02:10:00]  And it looks like Predator with the helmet on.  That's one.  I'm ready.  I'm ready to rub it.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Wait, hold it.  Before I do this, I need...  I got very slippery hands.  I'm all...  Don't look at me.  I'm an anti-matter-f***er.  All right, then.  You killed me.  I'm off the handle.  Wow.  You're unbelievable.  I'm going to take one more. 
[02:10:30]  All right, okay.  We're just about ready.  All right.  By the way, we're waiting for one more lady to show up for musicals.  Bring me to the lake.  These guys out of it.  All right.  These two out of their mind.  Wait, Mike.  There you go.  Just be very gentle.  Go slow.  Put a mic on Claire.  Put a mic on Claire.  Oh.  Oh.  Go.  More.  More. 
[02:11:00]  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Oh, my goodness.  All right.  Slow down.  Slow down.  Go slow.  Oh.  Slow down.  Oh, my God.  I'm done.  I'm done.  All right.  Mark it.  Mark it.  Mark it.  Mark it.  Mark it.  All right.  Mark it.  Oh, my God.  You didn't break it.  Didn't break the record.  No.  Very close.  I'm too pure medicine.  Wow.  Girls are horrified in here.  Their hands are over their mouths. 
[02:11:30]  They're looking in complete and utter terror at the Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  Underway.  By the way, do show up for the dildo contest.  Nothing better than someone screaming like that.  It won't be nearly as hard.  Okay.  Sorry.  Well, Claire, you made a good effort there.  I did.  Yeah.  I gave it the old college shot.  Good job.  The old college shot.  Good job.  Big, how close was she from the record?  How did I do?  Well, the previous contestant signed her name right above her mark, and you could still see 
[02:12:00]  her name.  Oh.  Wow.  We had another, like, half an inch to go.  Oh, I can't.  I'm a good guy.  Baby.  And all the other girls that came in from the Best Ass contest, which is also going on  today, they're horrified.  Just horrified.  It's so fun to watch them.  Hey, Rick.  Rick.  Where are the dildo girls?  Rick, talk to the girls that were horrified.  You guys know the categories.  Oh, horrified.  I can't even speak. 
[02:12:30]  I've never seen anything like that in my life.  Really?  No, I've really never seen anything.  I mean, I've watched porn.  I've watched a lot of things.  I've never seen anything like that in my life.  Could you hear the screaming?  That's it.  You know what?  That's disturbing.  The girl is really, like, messed up from that.  I love it.  What do you think about the back door entry?  Back door entry into the outdoor Led Zeppelin. 
[02:13:00]  That would be Led Zeppelin.  G.I.  Joe is getting out of hand.  It's not like that.  Relax.  Why?  It's just a panel.  Are you thinking of setting a record for another area?  A new record.  Would you be willing to set a new record for that?  Your boyfriend is saying a new category, which I would think would be an instant winner.  Dr. Stinky, what's wrong?  I don't want to mark that. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, no.  All right.  I have a contest.  What?  Maybe not the whiffle ball bet, but the green dildo.  Don't help that out.  All right.  Hold on.  The green.  No, that's okay.  Hold on.  Apparatus.  Don't worry about it.  I think we're done with the whiffle ball bet challenge.  Another girl horrified by what she just saw.  Oh, my God.  Actually, I think if you would have been in another position, it would have worked better  for you.  Which one? 
[02:14:00]  No, I don't know.  But sitting down, I think you can't take...  Which...  I don't know...  Sitting down?  Maybe laying down.  Because Christa beat my ass standing up, so...  Hold it.  What do you think?  Just laying down?  Missionary?  I don't know.  I don't know how you...  Maybe...  Yeah, it just...  I don't know how far you can take.  I can't...  Hey, the boyfriend's ready to give her an episiotomy just to win.  My boyfriend's ready for anything, baby.  I'm thinking Claire might give it one more shot. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, I might.  I would.  I would.  I don't think she can do it.  I don't think physically you can do it.  Please.  No, no, that's okay.  I won't shake anyone.  Don't take it personally, but I'm touching nobody.  Anthony, another girl horrified at what she just witnessed.  Yeah?  I would say rear entry maneuver.  I signed up for the contest, but that's a dump hit.  No, no.  Hold on, Claire.  Hold on.  Let us judge what we've got to dump and what we don't have to dump. 
[02:15:00]  We have to dump that.  I'm being proper.  Now, you can't say that word.  You can't judge Kristen's history.  Don't even...  Don't even go there.  Please.  Don't even go there.  Everyone, take a breath right now.  Matter of fact...  No talking.  Matter of fact, we're not going to go there.  Yeah.  Let's not go there.  There.  Yes.  All right.  We have one girl that came in, one more girl for the dildo musical chairs, musical dildo  chairs, if I could speak.  We need one more.  One more and we've got a contest. 
[02:15:30]  One more.  One more.  So, ladies, please, come down.  Anyone on their way...  We're down to the wire.  Give us a call.  We are down to the wire.  But, hell, this has been entertaining.  When you have Ben laughing that hard, I know it's entertaining.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  I think we can return the bat to the case.  Stinky can take the gloves off and wash his hands.  Put it back in the glass case.  Everybody can do a squirt of the disinfectant stuff there. 
[02:16:00]  All right.  There you go.  The bat is back in the glass case.  Wow.  For another day.  Now people are going to be looking at that bat a little different in the office.  Yeah.  You know, it's been sitting there for quite a while.  What?  I said, hey, Claire, wasn't your mom listening today?  My mom was not listening.  I'm so proud of the dildo challenge.  These two are out of their minds.  She's so special.  She's been doing it for years.  And now I am so proud of her. 
[02:16:30]  She's so special.  They just making it into the 2002 dildo Olympics.  She's back running around the world.  This guy's killing me.  I know.  All right.  That's something.  We'll take a break, Anthony.  All right.  One more girl and we've got a contest.  Yeah.  Yes, Ben?  Hit it.  We're still stupid.  Well, if that's what it takes to get good ratings, we'll continue being stupid.  We don't care.  We don't care.  And I've been expecting you to make exactly that last night's name. 
[02:17:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Theater of the Mindless.  1027.  WNEW.  Anthony Paisano, Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  Dan from Hoboken.  Very funny, man.  I want to thank Joey for sending down food today for this mess we call the O&A Show.  Yes.  The food is awesome today.  The sausage and peppers.  I know.  And what else we got out there?  We got the big ziti.  We got that vodka ziti thing. 
[02:17:30]  Oh.  Yeah.  And if there's one thing I think our contestants like, it's good food, Opie.  Ben, relax, man.  You're going to ruin it.  You're talking about me.  Anthony.  From Paisano.  And the most popular dish today was the fried ravioli.  Yes.  I didn't get any.  Paisano of Mulberry Street.  All the romance of Italy.  Warm, friendly, relaxed restaurant.  They serve incredible old world Italian cuisine.  Why is Ben handing me the live read for a stack or two? 
[02:18:00]  I don't...  We're doing Paisano.  The portions of Paisano's are huge, Opie.  Incredible pasta lunch specials, too.  You'll be eating that one for lunch.  What?  Huge?  Huge?  The portions, Opie.  Oh, okay.  At Paisano, the portions are huge.  Huge.  Incredible pasta lunch specials, too.  Ask for Joey, the owner.  You get a glass of wine on the house. 
[02:18:30]  And speaking of wine, Paisano's got a great wine list.  Paisano of Mulberry Street.  In the heart of Little Italy.  136 Mulberry.  Call them up.  965-1188.  965-1188.

[02:19:00]  Aaron Gobrales.  Right.  Patrick, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, listen.  With all those pigs in the studio and that food flying around.  You guys better be careful not to catch muffin mouse disease.  It's going around like crazy.  Thank you, Patrick.  See, now that's somebody who's trying to rain on our parade, I'll pick.  Anthony, this is going to mean something to someone out there.  Yeah.  The answer?  Too fitting.  I was going to answer Brian from Hoboken saying close to three.  Three? 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  Right?  I can't believe it.  What's the green beer, you ook?  Go oop yourself.  All right.  Where do we stand with musical dildo chairs?  All right.  We have how many girls?  Someone go count.  I think we have four and one possible.  Uh-huh. 
[02:20:00]  Hey.  OD.  Shut up, OD.  You're going to ruin it.  OD.  Call yourself QT for today.  Keep it on the QT.  Hey, why don't we turn down the monitor outside the studio for a little while?  Yeah, because we're getting some drastic feedback and stuff.  Rick, why don't you tell the people out there or somebody, turn the monitor down and tell them about the contest  and that we'll be starting shortly.  What I wanted to say, Anthony, is that we have two contests going on today, obviously.  The musical dildo chairs.  Yes. 
[02:20:30]  And the best ass contest.  Best ass contest.  It is.  You can just tell which contest the girl is entering by just looking at them.  Opie, I have not seen a collection of slobs like this in my whole life.  Dude, this is unbelievable.  What's up, OD?  Yo.  Hey, Claire, how are you?  Good?  Yo, it's Joe Rick.  What's up?  I'm fine.  You all right, Claire?  I'm doing great.  How are you?  Doing all right. 
[02:21:00]  Good.  Yeah.  What are we doing?  Well, we...  Build a game of what?  Well, how many girls we got out there?  We're trying to count.  Well, we got...  No one around here knows how to count.  We got four.  We were doing a blood alcohol contest.  I think we had a winner.  Aww.  I know it's so sad.  Nobody has any...  We're going to jail.  Nobody has any cojones.  I think Rick is briefing some of the girls out there.  All right.  The White House briefing.  Go out and get briefed because we're going to go on with this contest. 
[02:21:30]  Be briefed.  Good.  Go be briefed.  All right.  And we will have you back in and we will do the musical dildo chairs contest.  All right.  There you go.  Melanie's got something for us today.  Melanie, what's going on?  You know, I know why there's not any women in the studio today.  No?  Because every time...  We have women.  ...you come down there hot, ugly, thin, fat, they're treated like objects.  Oh, shut up.  I mean, what women are going to come down?  It's true.  Oh, God, Melanie.  I like to do it every day. 
[02:22:00]  We've never said nice things about the girls that come down.  Well, you say nice things about them, but, I mean, they're either treated as objects or freaks.  You kicks are objects.  Oh.  For our purposes...  You're an object.  For our purposes, yeah.  You're looked at as objects.  You object.  Okay, we'll admit it.  All right, later.  We'll admit it.  I love saying that.  It ends the conversation.  You treat us like objects.  You're an object.  Hang up the phone, you skank.  No, we'll invite some girls down and we'll talk about the economy for two and a half hours. 
[02:22:30]  Now, is the...  Rick, what's wrong?  What's wrong?  Good news.  What?  Blah, blah.  We have contestant number five.  Nice.  Contestant number five.  Yes.  Yes.  She didn't have something with her, but then they ran down and checked the car, and now  she's got some proof.  Rick, is the sound off out there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, I wouldn't even take a chance at this point, man.  We've got five girls.  No, dude, I can't hold it in any longer.  Something leaks out of the studio.  I can't hold it in.  The contest is going to be over.  I can't hold it in.  Don't.  I...  I...  Yeah, I... 
[02:23:00]  Ah!  No, no.  Turn on, turn on.  I turned off your mic.  Okay.  Shut that door.  No.  At the worst frat party in history, the drunkenness and fat-ness of the contestants.  I wouldn't screw one of these with gay Marcos, D.  This is like the Tri-Lambda part, right?  Revenge of the Nerds.  Right.  You're starting to look at each other out there, and something might be leaking through. 
[02:23:30]  No, nothing's leaking through.  The only thing leaking is from the various orifice.  Yo, you saw...  Yo, Ant.  You remember when I was telling you before about that skinny cat with that really funny...  All right, all right.  Do you see the guy?  Look.  There...  Okay, you said what you had to say, and you're kind of going to ruin this.  There's a black guy out there with his chick, the fourth contestant that came in.  She's got to weigh like three bucks.  Dude!  That is...  She weighs like 300 pounds.  This guy is like Jimmy J.J. Walker skinny.  So they make your number 10.  What's the big deal?  And he's pounding that? 
[02:24:00]  He weighs like a buck 30.  Dude, what is with the problem?  She's like three bucks.  What's with the problem?  Oh, Lisa.  Oh, that's like the number one.  Hello.  Hi, Lisa.  Yeah.  What's the matter?  Speak.  Hello?  Lisa, you're on the radio.  I think you guys don't have any women down there because you treat them like garbage.  We treat women great.  Lisa, we have 10 to 12 women out here, and some of them are very hot.  Yeah, but every time that they turn around, you're saying something behind their back.  Oh, Lisa, you need a protein gargle. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, that's a guy.  He couldn't hold it in.  At least you need a protein gargle.  Need protein.  Okay, are we doing this?  Are we set up?  Let's get our boombox.  Let's go.  Let's get our music.  We got the girls.  Here we go.  Let them sit on in.  All right.  Turn the monitor back up outside.  Okay.  Open the door.  Tell them we're all ready for the musical dildo chairs.  The show must go on. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  Very excited.  Oh, Claire's coming in again.  No, no, we're doing it outside, so we will be joining you guys outside.  Please remain in the musical dildo chair area, please.  The rope's off area.  It's like a damn pen.  It's amazing today.  Woo!  You've got to remember this one.  I got one in today.  Hey, where's the apparati people? 
[02:25:30]  There's a whole box of dildos outside.  They were rummaging through them like, I am apparatus.  They were rummaging through it like it was corn on the cob.  Freaking Omega Moose out there.  Dude, that's where I opened you, Ash.  And you told them to turn off the monitor.  What?  That was the fraternity or the sorority.  You're getting a couple dirty looks now.  Hey, how you doing?  How you doing?  Good.  Good, good.  Waiting for this party to happen.  You have the apparatus. 
[02:26:00]  You brought them.  You have quite a few.  We brought them.  We have quite a few.  30 for them to choose from.  Nice.  Nice.  The girls are choosing.  They've already chosen the ones.  Oh, they've chosen them.  I think so.  A lot of different colors and shapes that they're choosing.  A lot of different tastes.  And they are being placed on the chair.  Three lungs for St. Paddy's.  No one's eaten any, have they?  Oh, no.  It's just a viable question.  Well, there's one that is made out of chocolate.  I'm surprised that lasts a bit long.  Okay.  I thought I'd ask.  All right.  And you guys got to plug that website again because you guys really helped us out today. 
[02:26:30]  It's forbiddenfund.com.  It's the number four.  B-I-D-D-E-N-F-U-N.com.  And we got everything you guys need.  Yeah.  That's obvious.  But don't they look like a normal couple from, like, Jersey, the suburbia?  Sue, what are you saying?  They are normal.  2.5 kids.  The whole goal.  The house.  How about you guys?  Out on Long Island, right?  They are normal.  What are you saying?  Well, everybody's got to be, you know, out of control selling their stuff.  I'm just saying, you know.  When we went on the Ron and Fez show, he said the same thing. 
[02:27:00]  He's like, you guys don't look like you're selling.  Yeah, they look normal.  The thing I'm saying, you don't look like the type that would be selling vibrators.  Well, you don't look like the type to be selling drugs.  Well, go in, man.  Come on, O.D., I'm surprised the way you look.  On the real?  Yeah.  See?  Yeah, you thought he was darker, right?  Your leathers look like a delinquent or something.  See?  Do you like the Clark Gable mustache on Old Dirty?  You like my Gable mustache.  It's Gable Billy Dee Williams.  Hey, Ben's got something.  Yes, Ben, grab that mic from Old Dirty, man. 
[02:27:30]  I know he's starting to act up a little bit.  Oh, yeah.  What's happening?  G.I. Joe's trying to direct the whole setup on the chair.  Yeah, so we'll just keep G.I. Joe in check.  Yeah, I'm going to go slow G.I. Joe time, all right?  We'll keep G.I. Joe in check and make sure we organize this later.  I think he may be the sixth competitor.  I don't know.  Okay.  Well, we want to thank you guys again.  It's the number four, Anthony, for BidinFun.com, okay?  Anthony, we are going to take a break, and then this is the last break of the show.  We're coming back, and we're finally going to play a musical dildo chair.  Yes, for the trip to WrestleMania and cash prizes, all up for grabs. 
[02:28:00]  Can't wait.  It's all next.  And action.  I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk.  Okay, terrific.  And cut.  Opie, Anthony, 1027, WNEW.  Hello, hello, hello.  I think we're on the radio, Anthony.  We're outside the studio.  Everyone say hi.  Hi.  Look at that.  It looks like we're going to have a game after all.  Wow, I knew it.  I knew this would happen. 
[02:28:30]  We'd pull it together.  Anthony, we're doing musical dildo chairs.  Yes.  Ben, turn down that music for a sec.  Or turn it off.  Okay.  Stinky, crank up the music.  I just want to make sure that works.  We got the music, Anthony.  We got the contestants.  We have a trip to WrestleMania to give away.  Yes.  Of course, WrestleMania in Houston. 
[02:29:00]  Houston, Texas.  I believe it's, what, a couple weeks away?  Yeah.  That's some very cute music.  All right.  What we're going to do is double elimination because we didn't get as many contestants as we were hoping.  We thought for a second we had five.  Right.  Now we have four.  Right.  So we're doing double elimination.  So we've got to remove a couple chairs already there.  Actually, no.  The first round, everybody gets a sit so they get the chance to know how it works. 
[02:29:30]  Hmm.  First round.  Okay.  All right.  Everyone gets a sit.  But we still have two.  Oh, I got you.  We still have five chairs, though.  But, okay.  Yeah, push one away.  One, two, three, four.  So it'll be double elimination.  The winner of the contest will get the trip to WrestleMania and $250.  Thank you, Stockbroker Dave, wherever you are.  Oh, I forgot.  When you play musical chairs, the chairs each face a different direction as they alternate.  One, the other.  Oh, good, good.  So everyone can see girls play. 
[02:30:00]  Anthony, we'll be official judges to make sure the ladies sit down properly.  It's a tough job.  Yes, it is.  We will make sure it's all, uh...  We got this up, John.  Right.  There's Claire.  Right.  Claire's getting her...  Well, okay.  I can't describe what she's doing.  Yeah, I see what you're doing.  Okay.  Yeah, all right.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Now, the girls all have their appliances, Opie.  They are holding their appliances.  And have you prepared your appliances, girls?  Yes.  Everything's prepared? 
[02:30:30]  Who's got the field mic, Rick?  Okay.  Pass around the appliance preparation.  I'm all prepared, baby.  My little friend's all ready.  Pass it around.  Here.  Oh, God.  Where is it?  She's sharing it from her hand.  Oh, brother.  What a mess.  No, AAS Stinky.  Isn't there some of that...  There it is.  There it is.  Rick, all right, why don't we interview the contestants? 
[02:31:00]  Okay, who do we got?  Obviously, we got Claire.  Claire?  Yeah, obviously.  Claire?  Yeah.  You're the favorite for this contest, I think.  I am?  Why?  Do you think the huge amount of alcohol you've had will affect walking and sitting?  Anything like that?  No?  No, I think my coordination is quite on, and the huge amount of alcohol just affects my  ex-ambitionistic qualities.  Yeah.  Ex-ambitionistic qualities.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you very much. 
[02:31:30]  Good night.  Okay.  Anthony, usually when I see a girl stroking, it's usually hot.  Yeah.  I like it.  All right.  Like I said, usually.  Our latest contestant that we have that joined this.  Your name, please?  Gina.  It is Gina.  Yeah.  She is now taking care of the appliance.  Here for two, the things will be known as appliances.  Never refer to them as anything else.  Thank you.  Okay.  And where's Gina from?  I'm from Brooklyn.  And you want to win the trip to WrestleMania, right? 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, sure.  Why not?  The money, the trip, whatever.  Oh, she's here for the money.  Money, trip?  Sure.  Okay.  Why not?  All right.  Who else do we have?  One of these things is not like the other.  One of these things is not the same.  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  That, of course.  Why is everyone bowing?  And what's your name?  Nikki.  Of course, Nikki is Nikki. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  And she participated in the Best Ass Contest also.  I did.  I did.  And I think you did a great job, by the way.  Thank you.  I think she's a finalist.  I believe so.  Yes, Anthony.  By the way, the Best Ass Contest continues next week.  We didn't get enough contestants yet.  And what is possessing you to do this?  I really, really want to go to WrestleMania.  You do?  Yes.  Really bad.  And I wanted to be on the radio.  Don't we have extra tickets that we could just give her?  Yeah.  I mean...  I'm teasing, of course. 
[02:33:00]  All right.  Well, good luck.  And you think you can...  Your smaller size will be...  You'll be able to zip in and out of...  I think so.  You know, okay.  I think it's definitely an advantage.  She's going to be battered and bruised.  All right.  I think it's the...  I can hold my own.  David and Goliath thing that we're working with here.  She flips that slinger.  I'm not being mean.  She's...  Cassie's a little smaller than the rest of you, girl.  What?  And I say, am I breaking new ground here?  No, this is what I'm saying. 
[02:33:30]  Right.  Thank you.  I'm just...  I'm causing them as I season them.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  By the way, what's your name again?  Krista.  Krista.  She is the record holder for the Whiffle Ball Back Challenge.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  She's beautiful.  Yes.  She's not skinny.  Yes.  What?  What, Claire?  I don't care.  Claire, you're getting a little rambunctious over here, aren't you?  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  What did Claire say?  She goes, she's beautiful and she's not skinny. 
[02:34:00]  No one's saying anything.  You know the big girls have the balls to show up at this contest.  Absolutely.  So effing-lutely.  Thank you very much.  Yes.  Yes.  And so much to the check for that.  That's right.  That's right.  What am I saying?  Okay.  And who's next?  Who's our final contestant?  That's it, right?  Did you go, I am?  That was that.  Okay.  We got the four.  Okay.  Our four contestants lined up, ready to go.  It's a double elimination, Anthony, so the girls get, you know, two shots at this, obviously. 
[02:34:30]  So we got Claire, Nikki, Krista, and Gina.  Are you guys ready to play musical chairs or what?  Yay!  Woo!  Woo!  So the game works, Sophie.  If you miss a seat twice, you are out.  Correct, Anthony.  You get one free pass.  Yes.  All right.  I'm set.  Okay.  We're going to just do a practice round.  Every girl has a seat just to get a feel for the playing field, I guess.  Now, when you're in your seat, we want you to, you know, rotate and stuff, walk around. 
[02:35:00]  Walk around.  When you're in your seat and sitting and everything is where it's supposed to be, somebody has to  confirm that it is indeed where it's supposed to be.  What a hard one.  Okay.  So don't move.  Okay.  Why don't we start the music?  There we go.  Oh, they're walking around now.  The music is going.  And, oh, they don't, oh, look, they're doing the old strategy where you kind of linger in 
[02:35:30]  front of an open seat.  No, you must keep moving, girls.  Here you go.  Keep moving.  What a great song this is.  Oh, my God.  Like a day at Willowbrook.  Oh, oh, oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Now, um, okay, I'm seeing a problem.  How can we, how can we tell if they sat right? 
[02:36:00]  I have a question.  Actually, away from that.  I don't know about anyone else, but I can't see any part of the chair.  All right.  All right.  All right.  I'm glad we did this because we got to get the rules straight.  Okay.  Yeah.  Um, girls, when you sit.  Uh, the appliance has to be in a proper area, if you know what I mean.  Wait, which proper area are we talking about? 
[02:36:30]  Well, I don't think you could just be sitting on the chair.  I don't think you could just be sitting on any appliance that may be in the chair.  I think you know what we're talking about here.  Don't make me spell it out.  Am I, am I correct?  Um, let's see.  Rick, is she correct?  In this case, I would say yes.  Rick, take a look around at all the girls.  Are you correct? 
[02:37:00]  No.  You are not correct.  Are you correct?  And are you correct?  No.  No one's correct.  It looked like somebody opened the Ark of the Covenant over there.  I'm very surprised at Rick's reaction.  Don't look at it.  Hell at it.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Why don't we start the game, Anthony?  Oh.  Yeah.  He's your idea.  Rick, Rick, she's trying to talk.  What?  Krista?  She's trying to talk.  Why doesn't the appliance already be in place? 
[02:37:30]  Oh, oh.  And then you just run around and sit.  Hey, hey, if you want to.  Oh, oh.  Because you can hold it.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  She asked the same goddamn question that she just asked the right way.  You know what I think?  You best not talk so much.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry I'm drunk.  You best not talk.  That's okay.  Hey, no, there's no problem with that.  Give her some more food from Paizano.  Now, if you girls want to, as you walk around the chair, actually have certain things where 
[02:38:00]  they're supposed to be before you sit, that's fine.  Can we go somewhere to make certain things get there?  Yeah, go ahead.  If you need to, why don't you hit the J-Morph suite for a second?  Oh, what?  You can go into the bathroom and make sure everything is prepared properly to accept blah, blah, blah.  Okay?  All right.  We've got to get this contest rolling.  Yeah, we really do.  So, why don't we, ladies have literally like 30 seconds to get rid of it. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, God.  Damn.  I knew I shouldn't have ventured toward the forbidden zone.  Hot, funky ass.  Wow.  I'm sorry I'm just a pain in you.  What?  Oh.  The alcohol.  No.  No, you're not a pain in the ass.  No, I'm sorry.  No, that's okay.  I love you guys so much, and I'm just having a good time.  All right.  Hey, hey, that's all we're about.  Having a good time.  You know, get the ladies back here, because we're running out of time.  We really are.  Yeah, we're running out of time. 
[02:39:00]  We only have like 10 minutes left in the show.  The thing is where it should be.  All right.  All right.  Claire, get up.  Get up, if you can still stand.  All right.  There we go.  Okay, this is for real, so we've got to take one of the chairs away?  Take one chair away.  Wow.  Take the one that's dancing away.  Oh, my God.  What is that?  What is that?  What is that?  On that chair.  Woo!  All right.  All right.  You ladies ready or what?  You ready?  Okay. 
[02:39:30]  Here we go, Anthony.  The first round.  Double elimination.  Keep going.  The girls walking around.  There are three chairs, four girls, and the music is playing.  What a cute little song, Opie, huh?  Do you like this?  I got the CD.  The next track is really kickin'.  Oh, oh.  Yeah.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, I think you, uh, is that Nikki?  I think you, no, Nikki was good.  Nikki sat down first.  Yeah, I lost them.  I'm so sorry.  It's double elimination.  No elimination, so you got one strike against you.  Drunk Claire has got one.  Drunk Claire.  That was good.  I think that was luck.  I think she fell into the chair.  And they fought over that chair and the apparati.  Who would think Nikki's slender ass could actually overcome that avalanche? 
[02:40:30]  Claire's ass in the chair, but it happens.  Thank you very much.  See?  All right, everyone.  All girls up.  Sticky, if you will, start the music.  Here we go.  See, this is the song I was talking about.  I was playing this the other night.  This is a good song to get your F on, too.  Here they go, walking around the chairs.  They're staring.  Oh, yeah.  They're studying the chairs.  It's bad to be on that side, because there's only one chair open.  Right.  Here we go.  On our side.  They're running around the chairs now. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Nikki and James.  Oh, Nikki slid in again.  Whoa.  Your ass is on top of her.  I know.  Yes.  Yeah.  No arguing.  All judges.  We are watching closely.  She actually slid her ass in there underneath yours.  Right.  Which sounds physically impossible, but I just saw it.  Almost the case of where speed kills.  Right.  You're still in. 
[02:41:30]  You two each have a strike against you.  Yeah, now, Krista, who's the girl that set the whiffle ball bat challenge, has one strike  against her, and, of course, drunk Claire has one strike against her as well.  Now, girls, remember your appliances.  This is very important.  I've seen a couple of times where maybe the appliance wasn't where it was supposed to be.  All right.  Why don't we switch directions and walk the other way now, okay?  Uh-oh.  You're going to mix them up.  I just want to see Claire fall over.  All right, Stinky.  Go ahead.  Doo-dah, doo-dah. 
[02:42:00]  Come on.  Where's Earl?  This is Earl's favorite song.  Look at Earl's doing a little ham bone in the studio there.  Man, Nikki really wants this trip.  Doo-dah.  Doo-dah.  Oh, there's a break.  Oh, there's a break.  Wow.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, no, you're in.  Okay.  Drunk Claire made it, so.  Drunk Claire made it.  Gina? 
[02:42:30]  Gina has a strike.  Gina has a strike against her.  So everybody but Nikki has a strike against them.  Judges are checking to make sure they're sitting down properly, too, right?  Yeah.  Okay, very good.  Very good.  Wow, that was like two continental plates shifting.  Yeah, I know.  All right, Anthony, we got four contestants.  The only one that doesn't have a strike against her is Nikki.  Right now is Nikki.  Ginny, Nick, Nikki.  Yes.  Her weight may be an advantage.  It could be.  Who knew?  All right, Stinky.  Let's go.  They can't figure out what direction to go in, Anthony. 
[02:43:00]  As they walk around, they're walking around the chair.  There's still three chairs up there.  And the music is.  Oh.  Oh.  Claire is out.  Drunk Claire is out.  Out.  The first one knocked out of.  The musical dildo chairs.  Musical dildo chairs.  Drunk Claire.  Wait.  Gone.  Who wants this?  Oh, my God.  And her apparatus just dropped onto the floor. 
[02:43:30]  One of the girls' apparatus flew out.  It was Claire.  That was Claire.  Wow.  Yeah, get the hazmat team.  That one's shooting across the room.  I think it jumped out.  Hey, what happened to yours?  Oh, my God.  Where did yours go?  Where is it?  All right, hold on.  What happened to...  I don't even want to check under there.  Yeah, grab another one.  Grab another one.  Grab another one.  It flew out and hit some forward observer in Kuwait. 
[02:44:00]  All right, she's got to get a new apparatus.  We have one coming in.  She's in the pits now, getting a new one.  It's called to the bullpen.  It's called to the bullpen.  Anthony, so we now do the subway races.  So, Anthony, we lost Drunk Claire.  Nikki has no strikes.  Krista and Gina both have a strike.  A strike apiece.  That's an interesting name for this. 
[02:44:30]  The subway races.  The subway races.  Rick, take a chair away.  One chair comes away.  Three girls.  Two chairs.  Space one one way.  One the other way.  Rick?  Hey, look at this apparatus all over the floor.  Laying all over.  Like, they'd have been fired out.  Oh, my God.  My God.  That green one came out like a howitzer shell.  Did you see that?  I saw that.  Okay, here we go.  Start the music, Stinky.  All right, girls.  Oh, they're not walking in the same direction.  All right. 
[02:45:00]  All right.  Very nice.  As they walk around, three girls left.  Two chairs.  No stalling in front of chairs, ladies, or you will be reprimanded.  Oh, yeah.  We just lost Gina, Anthony.  Gina.  My butt just shifted over one way.  That's okay, Gina, because you get $100 for being in third place.  You just made $100, Gina.  Yay!  What happened over there?  What happened? 
[02:45:30]  You couldn't get on that chair, huh?  She's clapping with the apparatus.  I went to go sit down, and my butt just shifted over to the side.  Oh, damn.  She had it.  I was like two rhinos going at it.  I'm just kidding, Kristen.  Okay, we're down to two contestants, Anthony.  Two contestants now for the money.  All right, we got what?  The way the kids do it, one walks one way, the other kid walks the other way.  Oh, yeah, you're still... 
[02:46:00]  This is where we're at.  We got two contestants left.  Nikki has no strikes.  Crystal won.  If Crystal loses this round, Nikki is going to WrestleMania and collecting the $250.  Okay, girls.  Here we go.  One way, she goes the other?  Here we go.  Hey, you're on the inside.  That's not fair.  No fighting.  Don't move the chair.  Let's get a little ugly.  Oh, wow. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, my God.  That is close.  Nikki, it's a shutout.  Nikki is going to WrestleMania.  Oh, my God.  She just sat down on the chair properly.  You really have to know.  You get $150, though, by the way.  Krista, congratulations.  Thank you.  You came in second place.  She really wants to go.  So, either way, she was getting tickets.  I was going to tell you.  You get, yeah, $150.  Thank you, stop.  Plus a pair of Dice tickets, right, Ben? 
[02:47:00]  Plus a pair of tickets to the Andrew Dice Clay.  Is that cool?  Nice.  Westbury Music Fair.  Bring the dildo.  And, Anthony, we should talk to Nikki, our champion of musical dildo chairs.  She puts her pants on.  Oh, hell, yeah.  Great job.  You did a good job.  Thank you.  I saw your strategy was to stay in front of the chair as long as possible.  And then the second the music stopped, you would just use your slight build to skim underneath anybody.  That's right.  Amazing.  I was thinking about it beforehand, you know. 
[02:47:30]  I had something to do.  It took so long to do this.  You got to, you know.  She did a great job.  She did a great job, and she really wanted the trip to WrestleMania.  I really wanted it.  So this worked out perfectly.  And now you're also in the ass contest.  So you got that going for you.  Great.  Enjoy WrestleMania in Houston.  Thank you.  And $250 spending money, too.  Thanks to Stockbroker Dave.  Stockbroker Dave.  Thanks, Stockbroker Dave.  Any final thoughts, Nikki?  You are the champion.  I just can't wait to go.  All right, cool.  Big chance.  16 days.  Big chance for all of our musical dildo chair contestants. 
[02:48:00]  I'm proud of her.  I'm very proud of her.  I guess we could just end the show from here.  Yeah, we could do that.  What a cluster F, but I think at the end it worked out for everybody.  Doesn't it always somehow?  Thanks, guys.  This is awesome.  Thank you, everyone.  What?  What?  What?  What?  She's screaming.  She's screaming.  Rick, what?  I want a picture with them.  Oh, you can get a picture with us.  Yes.  Krista is the record holder of the Whipple Ball Bat Challenge. 
[02:48:30]  So, hey, it's O&A.  We've got to get the hell out of here.  Have a great weekend.  We'll see you guys Monday at 3 o'clock, all right?  Peace. </pre>
