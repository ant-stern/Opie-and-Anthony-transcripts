[07:00]
 perfect picture to draw the little mustache and if you don't like uh...  rudy and think he's like hitler  yeah that's the perfect picture to draw the little mustache the other muster  you know the listeners like to get involved take the front page of the  daily news undress them up in his hitler attire and uh... fax it into us and we  give you a this hitler but i have to give you some credit  i'm serious  well he's all up in arms about gum now  has he lost his friggin mind  has really just lost his mind at this point  the city 
[07:30]
 it's amazing we we've been cleaned up so much by rudy rudy's made the city such a  wonderful place to live now  there's no problems left  that it's got a point now where he just has to concentrate on people spitting  gum out spitting gum yes crime is done and no one ever gets raped or robbed in  the park anymore you know the toll collectors are all polite now officially  all polite i don't smell any urine when i go in the subways anymore as a matter  of fact that every subway station smells like those little 
[08:00]
 pop pine trees hanging your car whether hanging all over the subway and of course  yes it's great there's not one guy with a big load of crap in his pants sleeping  on the sidewalk now what is his problem with the chewing gum it leaves the big  black marks and he doesn't like that yes it leaves a big black marks on the  sidewalk but the huge urine stains are okay for goodness sake  suffer and suck a test you can't have gum on the sidewalks  we have a tumeric droid  so he's all up in arms about gum on the sidewalk yes now so if you are chewing 
[08:30]
 gum  and you spit it on the sidewalk or take it out of your mouth and don't wrap it  up in its little wrapper and throw it away you can now be fine now you know  something anthony i just thought of something how many people you think we  have listening right now  three or four  well then this isn't going to work i think as a protest everyone that is  chewing gum right now should spit out their car windows  well there you go i'm serious  you don't want to get these people in trouble  they're not going to get in trouble just look both ways and make sure no one's looking at you 
[09:00]
 that's a hanging offense  a hanging offense in this town i wouldn't doubt it soon to be yeah rudy there's  other problems the horses continue to crap on the streets of new york but he's  worried about gum  just the stench is of of urine and and i mean it's worse than gum i've never  worried about gum on the sidewalk no doesn't bother me any yeah it's like the  little new york walk of fame you just look at the gum stains and it's all  cute i've never noticed the gum on the sidewalk and there's actually celebrity 
[09:30]
 gum stains on those sidewalks you never know you never know that could be jean  simmons uh... gum right there  speaking of which i think he's calling us in a little while but uh... that's  right kids so i think everyone who is chewing gum right now is a protest  aspect of spit it out  you know place we beg you thank you  alright alright  more on the way if you want to uh... you know dress up rudy just take the the  cover of the daily news  do what you have to do in fact since i still want to nine five seven w any w 
[10:00]
 my  my new girlfriend gave me a hand job  and her wedding ring gave me a rash  one oh two seven w any w the rack of new york with the latest from the goo goo  dolls that slide off dizzy up the girl and neil young before that uh... cinnamon  girl and that was a song you had to be listening for this hour to win the kiss  tickets and steve's celery  uh... hopewell junction new york was paying attention and now he has 
[10:30]
 a pair of things to see cast congratulations steve  medical next hour of the song right now  you've got to be listening for cuts like a knife by brian adams when you hear  that  be the tenth caller two one two seven five seven  one oh two seven  you're hanging with opiate anthony good afternoon and we do indeed love faxes  fax lines two one two nine five seven w any w  and uh... this tax pretty interesting anthony  leave julianne alone he is a great mayor he should be president of the united 
[11:00]
 states of america in the future  before he became mayor everyone bitched about the cabs the crime the porn he  should be applauded for what he has been able to accomplish i went n.y.u. and it  was really bad now it's so much better give him credit he's a hell lot better  than that stinking dinkins before julianne the city was a toilet appreciate  the differences he's made  and he's a man of uh... honor  and he doesn't take any ass 
[11:30]
 all right that's what new york city needed time from jersey and i'm proud of  the job he's done you too should be too  actually i'm happy with the job the mayor's not exactly but done a great  job  he gets onto some ridiculous campaigns  i don't care if my toll collector doesn't uh... smile and as you know say  have a nice day thank you i don't care about that i've accepted the fact that  they're pretty much robots at the toll of boots and they don't want to deal with  the people that's fine  just give me my change and i'll move on  i don't want any discussion i i want like you can roll your car through the 
[12:00]
 toll booth now i don't want to stop yet so it's so thank you and stuff no  problem but if they want to give it to me it's an extra bonus and that's great  but it i don't care  and i really have a big issue he's making a big issue of that cat how he's  cleaned up everything and i i agree  i think he had but they did this way  just in the living room  and uh... someone comes in your mom maybe  or your wife and she starts backing in the carpet  cleans the carpet 
[12:30]
 but doesn't shut the back in often keeps going and going and going  you get annoyed after a while sure that's what he's doing and we get to you  like i a d with what's with the gum on the sidewalks it's kind of silly is that  a problem anyone is even addressed  d do you want does it bother you won't be i've never looked down the sidewalk  as i'm scared to know what what i'm gonna say down there yeah don't look  down yeah  don't step in gum i'd i've never  i was in bond if you live and work in new york you should look up  leave that to the tourists and don't look down 
[13:00]
 so it looks great and  as of the side who cares what's on the on the sidewalk is bigger problems in the  city still that's it there are bigger problems which would like question out to  our listeners  what do you think the mayor should fix or what do you think you'll help fix next  if he's onto this gum issue  they're bigger problems the the every day stinky subways get rid of the guys with  the the suitcases filled with the fake watches i want to see them on every  block  those don't even bother me quite frankly and then but i'd rather see them go then 
[13:30]
 the you know that the gums things up  right gums things on the painting  he's working out the top states  is this maybe a misprint  what is he saying gum  uh...  anywhere just reading it wrong  yeah i i i just thought some tell that  unfortunately this is radio if this is the internet we can't really speak up  i think that's the time so if you want to get in on the discussion today to a  two seven five seven one oh two seven  i believe we got jeans and it's called us in uh... a few minutes a stick around 
[14:00]
 for that  and keep the taxes coming as well to one two nine five seven  w any w i don't think anyone's using the instant feedback today have not w any  w dot com  you've been use your brain place  we like that  on the way we got some claptin in the wall flowers next one of his seven w  any w the rock of new york the latest from johnny lang that still raining off  wander this world it's open anthony you gotta stick around and uh... listen for  brian adams playing out cuts like a knife when you hear that be the test 
[14:30]
 card two one two seven five seven one oh two seven  and you will win tickets to see  and we should have paul stanley checking in  in minutes here anthony yes can't wait to talk to him yes  we're looking at the paper  europe europe parts head  albee when you look at their reports and when you mean about parts and  well that's what i'm  tomorrow call shumer out  the last amount of time now from chuck shumer that campaign is getting so 
[15:00]
 ugly stuff funniest thing that you watch the commercials on t v and they are just  pounding each other yes  charles shumer  when he was eight years old rank at doorbell  and ran away  do you want to send it to you  runs away from responsibility  come on chuck  they bought by five and i'll pass them out  that that does go back and forth i'll be honest i am to care less about that  election they hate each other but i could care less that will my life 
[15:30]
 personally change  that's why i always ask myself when i have vote for these politicians  nothing seems to change the problems in the world and  still getting taxed up to my eyeballs  you know you're a problem paying tolls just to get into the city every day  nothing changes in my life i could care less wins these elections  well i think it would be better to keep the model in and get this uh... charles  shumer in there  uh... chuck shumer seems a little too 
[16:00]
 until on the liberal side for me  quite frankly you know i don't like that they think that'll change things up  uh... probably not open from them being honest that you know i mean  but uh... i i don't want to you know take that chance i love when like you  vote for the president united states american they think about how they're  gonna  they cut taxes by like fifty million dollars and and you're looking at the  tv commercial like  while he's got cut taxes by fifty million dollars is great i'm gonna be  able to buy that new car that i always wanted 
[16:30]
 then you go to your calculator and you figure out exactly how much of the fifty  million that you're gonna save it turns out to be like a dime  i think that's great and i'm like oh you guys are full of ass  well i think the person that that  bashes the other guy the best should be in there  because that's the person you want in washington fighting for you i think they  should just have a cage match  yeah they could do that to duke it out  a celebrity death match like mtv does  the winner actually wins up  i don't know 
[17:00]
 but then i think all she would win  yeah hit alphonse domoto that big light bulb head  doesn't look like he has a life  he looks like the brain from taking the brain  i want to be there  senator from new york  i'm gonna rule the world  uh... that's funny  he does he's got that big light bulb head  well they're very good  one oh two seven w any w the rack of new york brian adams cuts like and i  felt as a sign had to be listening for this hour to win the tickets to see 
[17:30]
 the case and carol from hoboken new jersey was paying attention now she has  a pair of tickets  to seek is when they come to town the tickets of course going on sale saturday  at uh... nine a m through ticketmaster locations it's open at the end of the  balkan  hoboken  and  and whoever that  given as an adult every time you know about the new still think that you have  to do that of course okay speaking of case we got paul stanley uh... on the  line here  and also being at the 
[18:00]
 area  and thanks for calling it's a really appreciate  well i'm not on literally on the road among my way to rehearsal  where are you right now  i'm on the uh...  but the that must be the tamper at the no i don't know  this is a free some freeway what do i know from new york  and very god on the c  i must tell you the last time you guys came around it was the most fun of had  a rock show in many many years  well it's not what it's supposed to be a little people seem to forget that  you know just because it's rock and roll doesn't mean you can have fun and 
[18:30]
 have a good time  you know you want that news read the newspaper i'm not there to give you bad  news where they're into taking a  that's the other day i was starting to get to hear all the bands looking down  at their shoes and stuff you know i do i figure if a band is going to look at  their shoes  and you're going to look at you look at our shoes i mean i got a huge heels  now you guys get the best use of all that's right there at their busy  there at their combat boots  i want you to look at my eight-inch leather heel very cool and we saw the  fire and the blood it was just classic kiss for us to get back together in the 
[19:00]
 original line of the only way we would do it  and if we were going to pick up where we left off and and do  you know classic kid there's no surprises the only surprises how good  it is and this uh... this tour is going to be in three days and explain that a  little bit  i don't want to over-emphasize the three people are because it's first and  foremost that you know we're back  onto our the band sounds better than ever  uh...  we're doing at least two hours  atlantic last time it clocked in i think we're playing about twenty two songs 
[19:30]
 twenty three songs  and uh... the lights are awesome the the pyro  you know the bombs all the stuff it's all there it's enough to take the roof of  the building off and then additionally  we're using three big technology we're using these massive screens behind us  whereby  when you put on your kids really glad that you get when you come in at certain  points during the show i do my best you know to get into to get into the guy's  faces in the women's laps i mean that's really what i think all 
[20:00]
 it's it's kind of interactive in the sense that  you know we're there and we're interacting with you so it's uh...  really state-of-the-art three d technology but additionally the sound is  awesome the lights are often the pyro saw some we have this  amazing circus traveling with us  today as much as i like a lot of other bands most of the time people who come  to see us usually wind up saying why do you have so and so opening right now  so what we did this time is we're bringing out a circus  so far we have a dynamite lady who blows herself up we have a ball of death with 
[20:30]
 motorcycles going around avoiding each other inside a steel cage i've seen that  that's real cool  yet we have a whole lot of cool stuff because uh... i think that it's much  more  of uh... your money's worth to see something that you want to see them to  hear a band you don't want to hear planning you guys get the whole line of  together a little sooner  because we didn't we're not up there were times we were getting along there  were times where a lot of that from growing up to do  and uh... everybody was always wishing all the fans were wishing that we would 
[21:00]
 get back together but i would think never wish for anything that you're  going to regret getting  and if we had done it at the wrong time for the wrong reasons i think people  would have been very disappointed in what they thought  we have this great history this legacy and this legend of what we did  and for us to come back  and kind of tarnish it would have been horrible so  you know  we waited until  i need to do it or we never would have done it we waited until we were ready to 
[21:30]
 go out  and really like  blow the roof off i mean  we set a level of what we did before and we had to be able to go past it  because  for us  we not only have to live up to our past  the reality of our past we have to live up to what people remember whether it's  accurate or not  so  you know it was serious stuff for us  and at this point for us to go out  if anybody had any doubts before  you know we're doing this because we love doing it i mean this was the largest 
[22:00]
 grossing tour of the year  last time we went out so if we were doing it for money it would be all over  yeah without a doubt  you know we really love what we're doing and uh...  we're really excited to go back out there and so  uh... which were fired up i have to drive literally an hour and a half every  day to rehearsal  well over a airplane hangar  how cool  yeah plan that that that that that was like a driving our have to go to  rehearsal for my job  uh... that's what you know  you're lucky you don't have to drive an hour and a half to work 
[22:30]
 so you can from long island into manhattan  come on got  long island long island and you know that's an hour  what a good  uh... we are in our area fifty-two days while exactly people  you guys have seen uh... a lot of kids paraphernalia over the years  you bet you know what is the strangest thing you've seen  uh... man has actually like the pinball machines in the board games are  and the car for us  you know paraphernalia not that weird because  it never surprised or because we okay everything you know that goes down to 
[23:00]
 the paraphernalia  when you look at it  without a penis  uh... you know that was a set time of sexual repression  they were afraid that i would screw party at all  and then i want to come out of some kiss condoms is something that we had a  needed  yeah we had a mother a couple years ago on tour  and uh...  i can't really endorse or anything uh... 
[23:30]
 they might leave  uh... not and what's up with this kiss movie and he has a making  uh... there there are really cool movie called the trot rock city  and uh...  it's a seventy film it takes place in the seventies as i like  upcoming of age film about four  for uh... young people on the way to a kid concert  and all the stuff they go through getting there  and uh... it's  very very cool matter-of-fact in about  two and a half weeks were filming  a uh... 
[24:00]
 uh... concert sequence where we're there  basically have all an audience of about five to ten ten thousand people  trippin seventy  you know close and we're going to learn  to detroit rock city  how we're doing in l a i think it'd be uh...  l a sports arena  it's a it's a chance for our parents to be a more delight by being in the film  so i thought it was really cool that shooting  as we speak in toronto  very good it was your first time to do it to both do you remember 
[24:30]
 the first carter i went to  yard birds yard birds  which was with jimmy page  i would love to see that  and uh... after that thought  hindricks experience a couple of times  you know with uh... mich mitchell and all reading  and i thought  zeppelin when they were playing for  you know it like fifteen hundred people  so uh...  i got in i got in early  it's going to be all from the comeback to new york community  it means so much job 
[25:00]
 you know having grown up there  and how i was a cab driver i remember  dropping people off at madison square garden  you know so uh...  or driving past national coliseum  you know or watching metal and get built so  you know when we come back to the new york area it's it's very very cool for  us and i would when you were a cab driver did you pick up anyone famous  no  i never had anybody famous in the camp  i i had all  i had all the uh...  i don't want to say the losers but uh... 
[25:30]
 i didn't have anybody famous  one day  this shows you how out there i can be  one day i picked up this guy sitting in the back and i keep looking in the mirror  thinking  this guy's a famous actor i don't know  what film he's from but this guy's really famous because i know his face so well  so i keep looking at him  i never figure out who it is  and then he gets out of the camp  and for weeks of trying to figure out who this guy is  one day i'm sitting in the uh...  my parents live in a world living at the time  and i look out the window and i feel more part of the writing of my neighbor 
[26:00]

[27:30]
 explodes itself yet the third a circus act yet a little circus act before uh...  just comes in and i i would keep almost guaranteed to open up with uh... welcome  to the show cycle circuit or self  uh... it's kinda hard to show today because the whole town is just  excited about the yankees victory last night  unbelievable we said we we said early that they were going to sleep i guess  that was pretty obvious on  yeah everybody knows it was the only way this season could end really 
[28:00]
 because with the sweeping win of the series the way the yankees played and  we got the big parade tomorrow  but uh... those podge a fence  i'll put your towels away now i got a little hang on your wall until the story  how you were at the world series and they're all crying on their husband's  shoulders and even i still have a guy's a crying too did you see that  yet box cameras first of all you can just zoom in on any open poor on your  face  is it necessary that box cameras have to like just get every single hair on 
[28:30]
 anyone's face  did you see  by any credit  yeah did you see that is like that  is a nose almost broke the camera lens at one point i believe he needs to uh...  trim some of those those areas it's like we didn't need to see that you know they  just have that fox cam whoosh whoosh we're going to bring you right in up andy  pettit's nose here it is here's the bench and you're seeing sinuses and mucus  like a five-pack awful it was okay yeah i don't need that view sure but the uh... 
[29:00]
 the fans in the stands over there in san diego they were all whipped into a  frenzy they thought they were going to be the first team in history from a three  oh two  we're going to do it  it's our team  yeah i held those yankees scoreless right  at rb i  you're supposed to win  i thought i was going to see a victory 
[29:30]
 i came to see my  team win in the world series  why are we being swept  i'm right now  the saloon yes the one with the ball  she had a big ball with a dirty rag hanging off of it and she put the ball  against their head and like pray you know i guess  well that didn't help now did it i'd like to have my  uh...  they ship

[30:30]
 boston nineteen seventy eight who want to crack some skulls and and fire  someone  i want to remember the george steinbrenner like the little clay nation  figure in the blipton ice tea commercial  yeah where it's like  you know where the baby's like i can make it read you know  any fires billy martin yes billy you're fired that's the old george not this  whiny blubbering man blubbering uh... i don't know what he was well can i give  my analogy again 
[31:00]

 Corky Stein, Red Rocks type.  Ah ah!  Hi, N.E.W.  Oh, hi!  I just have to tell you guys the best.  You are so hysterically funny.  I'm not one to make fun of retarded people, but that was hysterical.  We were making fun of George.  I know.  And as early as you are,  I'm the first person that complains about that.  It's common, trust me.  Alright, Opie?  Love that laugh.  Oh, thank you. 
[34:30]
 Alright, bye.  Georgie Stein, Billionaire is my name.  We won the Yankee baseball game.  Georgie Stein, Billionaire is my name.  We won the baseball game.  Can I have a corn dog, please?  Can I have a corn dog, please?  Georgie!  I want corn dog!  Georgie Stein, Billionaire is my name.  Everyone, the baseball game!  Georgie!  Bye bye!  Ha ha ha!  You gotta see his face.

Everyone, the baseball game!  Everyone, the baseball game!  Someone just drove off the road somewhere.  We got the laser of Letty Kravitz on the way.  And the Rolling Stones next. 
[35:30]
 Hi, what's up?  Nothing.  You guys are hysterical.  You guys? I love that.  They say I have a grammar problem.  Ha ha ha!  Just got off work relaxing.  Oh cool, what made you laugh today?  Oh my God, when you were doing Korky Dacha.  I'm Korky Steinbrenner, I mean.  Ha ha ha!  We won the game!  We won the Yankee Dacha champion!  We won the champion!  We won the champion! 
[36:00]
 I'm sitting going to get gas.  And I'm like, wait a minute, I can't shut the car off.  And the Indian is waiting for me.  And he's banging on my window, how much, how much?  And I'm just laughing.  And I'm quite loud and he's like, oh okay.  Well, he looks like Korky grown up last night, huh?  Oh man, that was too funny.  They win the game, now I need a lollipop.  To build the Yankee wind.  Oh boy!  Anthony's got another observation for you on the game last night.  Did you take a look at Tony Gwyn's head?  Tony Gwyn's head looks like the surface of Fred Flintstone's bowling ball.  I don't know what's going on. 
[36:30]
 It had like pits in it and I don't know, like it had been left out on the driving range too long.  Did you see the other game?  They were zooming in and they were like, look there's a moth on his hat.  Yeah, yeah.  Like it threw off his hit and throwing and pitching and yeah.  Yeah, right.  The moth is like, you know, spit.  But I love when they go, oh, I'm going to get a moth on my hat.  And I'm like, oh, I'm going to get a moth on my hat.  And I'm like, oh, I'm going to get a moth on my hat.  Yeah, like the moth weighed 10 pounds and it threw off his throwing.  Yeah, yeah.  But like the zoom-ins, what is with that?  They show the guys in the dugout, they're either spitting or shooting snot out of their nose.  Yeah. 
[37:00]
 They just got to get a life and just go back to just showing us the game.  The stupid stats and the moth, all that has to go.  And the sound effects when they're showing the guy's stats.  Let's pull up his stats.  All right.  Let's see what we got.  Let's see what we got.  Let's see what we got.  Let's see what we got.  Let's pull up his stats.  Yeah, it looks like the beginning of Melrose's place.  They were showing the guys in the side profile, front profile, with the Melrose music in the background. 
[37:30]
 And do we need the Biori strip cam on the pictures?  You see how close they are?  I think they breathe right.  It's like right on his face.  But I have to tell you, my whole entire family listens to you.  But my brother is like, he's nuts over yous.  It's just too funny.  Yous?  Where are yous from?  I know, I'm sorry.  Born in Brooklyn, raised in Staten Island.  Hey, you really teached me something today.  Hey, at least I don't say teach.  I taught you something. 
[38:00]
 All right, all right there.  All right there, yous guys.  Oh, can I get kiss tickets?  We're going to give those away in a little while.  How are we going to do that?  I've been sitting here for like 20 minutes trying to call yous.  Yous!  I hope you have picked those habits up for me.  Can I tell you one other thing?  Can I tell you one other thing?  All right, the other night I watched a rerun of the date line,  because the game wasn't on.  And they had this couple who couldn't get pregnant.  So it was in Norway, they went to some clinic,  test two baby, the whole works. 
[38:30]
 They wind up having twins.  Now this couple's blonde hair, blue eyes, everything.  They wind up having a black kid and a white kid.  I saw that.  All right, did you hear what the black kid's name was?  No.  I didn't hear that.  But they showed this one of the kids crib, and it was spelled Coone.  It was hysterical.  I was telling everybody, they thought I was telling a joke.  I'm like, well, I guess in Norway, you know,  Coone is a regular name, but  you name a black kid here Coone, I'm sorry.  Yeah, yeah, goodness.  All right, with that we've got to let you go. 
[39:00]
 All right, take care.  Keep listening for the police, every little thing she does is magic.  That's your cue to call in for the kiss tickets.  Okay, great. Bye.  My goodness.  Insane. I've never heard of such a thing.  That's just an observation. I actually did see that the other night.  Did you? Yeah.  All right. Something got messed up with the  spermies or something.  Well, oh, I have found it on the computer.  What?  George Steinbrenner from last night.  Oh, want to play his audio? Yeah, Corky Steinbrenner.  1027 WNEW, the rock of New York. 
[39:30]
 The Steinbrenner audio is next, I guess, huh?  Oh, your mic's not on. Go ahead, what?  I said yes.  1027 WNEW, the rock of New York.  With the police, every little thing she does is magic.  That was the song you had to be listening for for the kiss tickets.  And Mike Neerdoff of Brooklyn was paying attention.  He's got a pair of tickets.  Congratulations, Mike.  Brooklyn. Brooklyn in the high house.  In the high house.  Flip mode squad.  Big ups to my flip mode squad. 
[40:00]
 All right.  Next hour, when you hear Janie's Got a Gun by Aerosmith,  be the first to hear it.  Janie's Got a Gun by Aerosmith.  Be the 10th caller at 2127571027,  and you'll score your tickets to see kiss.  Topia and Anthony.  Hey.  Are we calmed down now?  My ribs hurt.  My ribs hurt from that last break.  From Corky Steinbrenner.  What's the instant feedback say?  Oh, my God. 
[40:30]
 Well, see, people seem to like it.  Let's see, Joe and the Bronx.  You guys have no idea what trouble I almost got into.  I was sitting in sociology class  doing what I normally do,  not paying attention to the teacher  and listening to you guys.  Then you did Corky Steinbrenner and Crazy Georgie.  I practically burst out laughing  in the middle of some student's presentation.  Half the class then actually heard me,  thought I had gone nuts.  Thanks for the laughs.  Very cool.  As a result of the Steinbrenner bit, I've been gaffed, clubbed, 
[41:00]
 and pulled over the side.  So he has joined the faithful, you think?  Well, thank you.  All I ask is if you enjoyed the Corky Steinbrenner today,  make us one of your presets  and tell someone about us.  We appreciate that.  Just trying to move up on the preset list.  That's all we're trying to do.  I know we've been quite negative a lot this week,  but we also should be very positive.  We know there's a lot of people checking us out.  We totally appreciate that.  As we slowly but surely build our little afternoon audience.  Anthony? 
[41:30]
 I got the audio from Corky Steinbrenner.  I can't even call him George anymore.  Well, he just didn't look like the George of yesteryear  that everybody remembers.  Kind of a little rotund maybe.  At times.  Always in control.  The badass, firing managers all the time.  Not taking any crap.  And there he was last night.  Whimpering.  Emaciated kind of.  Looks like he had some vodka in his baby food or something.  Does he look like he eats baby food now? 
[42:00]
 He's got the skin hanging under his neck.  Like Foghorn Leghorn.  I mean, I felt bad for him.  He was whimpering.  So would you like to check out some of the audio from his...  Yeah, let's hear it.  This is really the audio.  Which is scary.  Mr. Steinbrenner, as you watch your team  walk into this locker room,  there were tears in your eyes.  This is the fourth championship  in six appearances in the World Series. 
[42:30]
 Where does this one rank?  The top. Right at the top.  This is truly,  you can say it now,  one of the greatest teams in baseball.  And to get it from Bud, we've been friends  26 years.  And we really worked for this.  In 1996,  this team won the championship.  The word that Joe talked about was hearts.  This team,  I've never seen anything like it.  They just never quit. 
[43:00]
 They seem to be able to  overcome everything.  It was an emotional team.  They did a great job.  The players deserve all the credit.  And I know your thoughts are with Darryl Strawberry.  He's great, no.  There was Joe DiMaggio.  There was all of those people.  Enjoy the celebration.  Congratulations, Mr. Steinbrenner.  The man that manages ball clubs.  There were all of those people. 
[43:30]
 Incredible.  Absolutely incredible. That's the same guy  that used to crack skulls in his crazy Georgie outfit.  Insane!  Crazy Georgie!  I mean, does he need the...  That's in the iced tea commercial.  When he's the claymation figure,  he's wearing the turtleneck and the jacket.  That's why he broke it out last night.  That's his trademark.  He looks just like Crazy Eddie.  Alright.  Okay. 
[44:00]
 No, no, no.  Stay right there, Corky.  On the way, we got some nirvana.  And the doors.  We won!  And the doors!  And the doors!  Toby and Anthony, getting ready to rock on here.  Yeah, we got Mike, I guess.  He says, isn't George Steinbrenner  the guy who played Mr. Kinkade on the Partridge family?  Come on, it's got to be the same guy.  That's pretty good, actually.  1027WNEW, the rock of New York. 
[44:30]
 The latest from Hole, Celebrity Skin.  Title track from Courtney's latest CD.  Toby and Anthony, we got to  congratulate Lee Espinoza  of Dover, New Jersey, our latest kiss winner.  Congrats.  Got to congrats all the kiss winners today.  Matt DeBote is going to continue the winning,  so keep listening.  Look at the time.  Got to thank Paul Stanley for checking in today.  It was very cool to talk to the man.  Yes.  We got to thank Corky Steinbrenner for stopping by.  It's always a pleasure when he makes a visit. 
[45:00]
 He never has before.  I have a feeling he's going to be making a lot of  visits in the near future.  You got to love Corky Steinbrenner.  All right, we got to get out of here.  Tomorrow's FU Friday.  Yes. Very excited about that.  We're going to start faxing your FUs before we get here  because we'd like a nice pile waiting for us  that we could comb through.  So the fax line for tomorrow, 212-957-WNEW,  you can do that during Carol's show  and she'll put them aside for us, I'm sure.  Yes.  She's good that way. 
[45:30]
 I think we need to leave you with this here.  We'll see you tomorrow at 3.  As we leave you on this Sunday morning,  here's me taking a big poop.  Sometimes a poop is a good thing on a Sunday morning.  Something you'd like to share with your neighbors,  your friends.  Here's me and the sounds of dumping.  Oftentimes we don't have time to show you the poop.  Today here's me taking a dump 
[46:00]
 and then me showing it to you.  Oftentimes we like to leave our viewers  with a little something from the outside.  Today it's me taking a poop.  Here's me running to the outhouse  to take a big old Harry.  And as we leave you on this Sunday morning,  the sounds of pooping,  the sounds of the sound of the poop, 
[46:30]
 the sounds of the sound of the poop,  the sounds of the sound of the poop,  the sounds of the sound of the poop,  the sounds of pooping.  Because there's nothing better  than a good poop. </pre>
