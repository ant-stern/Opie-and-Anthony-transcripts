<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a gleeful, and at times mocking, discussion of the New York Yankees' World Series victory.  The hosts relentlessly ridiculed George Steinbrenner's emotional reaction, employing offensive terms like "retarded kid" to describe his behavior, comparing his appearance to "Crazy Eddie" and Corky from *Life Goes On*, and repeatedly mimicking his perceived post-game statements and demeanor.  This segment transitioned into commentary on New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani's perceived obsession with combating gum on sidewalks, a focus they contrasted sharply with the city's more pressing issues. They proposed a listener-driven protest against this policy.

The show then featured a call-in interview with Paul Stanley of KISS, who promoted their reunion tour, highlighting its incorporation of 3-D technology and a circus-style sideshow.  Stanley surprisingly revealed his past experience as a New York City cab driver.  Interspersed throughout the broadcast were listener calls, some sharing humorous anecdotes—including a caller recounting a story of a Norwegian couple having twins of different races—and others participating in a game to win KISS concert tickets by identifying songs played on the air.  The hosts also briefly, and negatively, discussed the upcoming "ugly" D'Amato-Schumer Senate race.  The broadcast concluded with a replay of George Steinbrenner's post-game remarks followed by a sound effect of defecation.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York, Semi-Sonic and Closing Time.  We've been playing that song for quite a while now, Anthony.  And those guys came up about, what, three or four months ago and performed that for us?  Yeah, as a matter of fact, I think so.  Cool band, you know.  They're what modern rock is all about.  Yeah.  And Howard discovered them this morning.  Way to be in touch, pal.  Well, I'm just surprised, you know,  Keishlock would even play them at all, 
[00:00:30]  since I remember they were ragging us for playing that band.  Yeah, they ragged every station in New York for playing Closing Time,  and then now all of a sudden they like the band, I guess.  Because Howard discovered them this morning, finally.  A little confused, though.  Howard, there's another band you should check out.  Their name is Green Day.  They're really cool.  They're real hip.  A brand new band.  Might want to have them on the show, too.  Out of touch.  Oh, my goodness.  It's a little bit out of touch.  Really?  Of course. 
[00:01:00]  They're just hypocritical over there, that's all.  Yeah, that's what I see.  All right.  So what's up, man?  Well, you know, feeling good?  Yes, the whole town is feeling good.  Yankees, World Series champions of the world.  Bet our Yankees, yes.  It was good, once again, to see them over there, San Diego.  The fans all whipped up in a froth over there in San Diego.  Waving their towels.  With their stupid, dirty towels.  They were convinced they were going to, you know, win four in a row. 
[00:01:30]  This is it.  When you heard them on interviews and stuff, they'd go out in the parking lot and talk.  It's like, yeah, no, we're still in this.  This team has heart and determination, and, you know, we're...  And there they were, the fans with their towels.  They did a lot of fan shots on Fox, too.  Yeah.  And they're all whipped up, yeah, another strikeout.  Woo, another scoreless inning.  You Yankees aren't going to score on us.  And before you know it, oh, here comes an RBI. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  But, but we were supposed to win.  But how could they sweep us?  We have to come back and be the only team ever to win the World Series after losing three.  Hey, how did this happen?  It was just amazing to see all the fans crying and stuff in the stands.  It was hysterical.  Woo, we're going to beat the Yankees tonight, but we're going to beat... 
[00:02:30]  What happened?  But we beat Atlanta.  Yeah, but the best highlight of all time was George Steinbrenner in the locker room crying.  What happened to this guy?  What happened to George?  What happened to George is right.  I want the George of 1978.  Where's the...  He was much more exciting.  He was a man back then.  He was the boss.  Yeah.  Know what he looked like last night when he was getting his trophy? 
[00:03:00]  What?  He looked like a retarded kid at a fair after you tell the kid that he can't have another corn dog.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  Well, look at the pictures in the paper.  Tell me that I didn't hit that one right on the head, man.  I don't know what his problem was, though.  He's crying and everything.  That's not the boss we remember, George.  No, do the crying thing, man.  Well, he's being handed the trophy. 
[00:03:30]  He's like, getting this, because this is one of the best Yankees teams ever.  And getting this trophy from a man that I've known for 21 years.  And his face is all contorting, like his mouth is all moving around and everything.  Yes.  And he's dressed like Crazy Eddie.  Yeah, what was up with the Crazy Eddie get-out?  He's got the white turtleneck on and the little blazer jacket over it. 
[00:04:00]  Crazy Georgie!  The Yankees are insane!  Did you see him?  I did.  It was very entertaining.  We're having a clearance sale!  Yeah.  Everything's got to go!  Bernie Williams!  The stadium!  It's Crazy Georgie!  I'm insane!  With his turtleneck.  He's weeping openly.  Oh, that's good stuff.  Did you see him actually holding on to Joe Torre? 
[00:04:30]  He's like, hold her.  Weeping and, oh, please, Daddy, just one more corn dog.  Where's the George with the baseball bat ready to rack some head?  Yeah, that's the George in the boardroom, of course.  Firing Billy Martin years ago.  Remember that, George?  Now we have the weeping, contorted-faced, Crazy Eddie-dressing George.  Insane!  He looks like Corky.  He did. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, my goodness.  He looked like Corky from Life Goes On.  You know, when Corky gets older, he's going to look like George Steinbrenner.  I own the Yankees.  I own the Yankees.  Thank you for, thank you for trophy.  I own the Yankees now.  I, I, I own the Yankees.  Well, we're going to know what happened to the George of days gone by.  It's kind of sad.  I do believe we're going to have some fun today. 
[00:05:30]  Yes.  The whole city's in a good mood.  2-1-2, 7-5-7, 1-0-2-7.  We'll change that.  Fax line, 2-1-2, 9-5-7, W-A-N-E-W.  I own the Yankees.  I own the Yankees.  We won.  Lollipop, please.  Lollipop, please.  We won the Yankees.  Thank you, Yankees.  Ooh, boo-hoo.  All right, we'll do We Are the Champions in just a bit here for you guys.  You're waiting for it.  And right after the commercials, I'm going to tell you what song you've got to be listening for  to win the Kiss tickets later this hour, okay? 
[00:06:00]  We won the Yankees.  We won the Yankees.  Give me a corn dog, Bobby.  Corn dog, Yankee.  We the winner.  We Yankees won.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York.  Kenny Wayne, Shepard, Blue-Eyed, Black Queen.  Before that, for all the Yankee fans out there celebrating the big victory.  Of course.  Parade is tomorrow.  That's going to be absolutely wild.  Mm-hmm.  Did you see Rudolph Giuliani?  Yes, I did.  Last night, celebrating the Yankee victory? 
[00:06:30]  Yes, I did, with his Yankee jacket on.  Yeah.  He's all very proud of the team.  And he announced officially the parade for tomorrow.  I like this picture on the Daily News today.  I haven't seen that.  Did you see it?  Wait, I have to get through the special World Series pages.  Yeah, you've got to unfold all that.  All right.  Is it a good picture, Ant?  It's such a waste when they do that.  It's a big wrap around.  Like, what are you going to do?  Put that on your wall?  Of course.  I used to save all this stuff when I was a kid.  All right.  The picture of Rudy.  What is that face he's making? 
[00:07:00]  That is the perfect picture to draw the little mustache in.  If you don't like Rudy and think he's like Hitler, that's the perfect picture to draw the  little mustache, the Hitler mustache.  You know, the listeners like to get involved.  Take the front page of the Daily News, dress him up in his Hitler attire, and fax it into  us, and we'll give you his Hitler attire.  We'll give you some credit.  I'm serious.  Well, he's all up in arms about gum now.  Has he lost his friggin' mind?  Has Rudy just lost his mind at this point?  The city, it's amazing. 
[00:07:30]  We've been cleaned up so much by Rudy.  Rudy has made the city such a wonderful place to live now.  Now, there's no problems left that it's gotten to the point now where he just has to concentrate  on people spitting gum out.  Spitting gum, yes.  Crime is done.  No one ever gets raped or robbed in the park anymore.  Yeah, the toll collectors are all polite now, officially.  All polite.  I don't smell any urine when I go in the subways anymore.  As a matter of fact, every subway station smells like those little pine trees you hang in your 
[00:08:00]  car.  Well, they're hanging all over the subway.  Oh, of course.  Yes.  It's great.  There's not one guy with a big load of crap in his pants sleeping on the sidewalk.  Now, what is his problem with the chewing gum?  It leaves the big black marks and he doesn't like that.  Yes, it leaves the big black marks on the sidewalk.  But the huge urine stains are okay.  For goodness sake.  Suffering succotase.  You can't have gum on the sidewalk.  I mean, have a tumurgatroid.  So he's all up in arms about gum on the sidewalk.  Yes.  Now, so if you are chewing gum and you spit it on the sidewalk or take it out of your mouth 
[00:08:30]  and don't wrap it up in its little wrapper and throw it away, you can now be fine.  Now, you know something, Anthony?  I just thought of something.  How many people do you think we have listening right now?  Three or four?  Oh, then this isn't going to work.  I think as a protest, everyone that is chewing gum right now should spit it out their car windows.  Well, there you go.  I'm serious.  You don't want to get these people in trouble.  They're not going to get in trouble.  Just look both ways and make sure no one's looking at you. 
[00:09:00]  That's a hanging offense.  A hanging offense in this town.  I wouldn't doubt it.  Soon to be.  Yeah.  Rudy, there's other problems with the city.  The horses continue to crap on the streets of New York, but he's worried about gum.  Just the stenches of urine.  I mean, it's worse than gum.  I've never worried about gum on the sidewalk.  No, not really.  It doesn't bother me, Andy.  Yeah.  It's like the little New York Walk of Fame.  You just look at the gum stains.  And it's all cute.  I've never noticed the gum on the sidewalk. 
[00:09:30]  And there's actually celebrity gum stains on those sidewalks.  You never know.  You never know.  No, that could be Gene Simmons' gum right there.  Yeah.  Speaking of which, I think he's calling us in a little while.  That's right.  So I think everyone who is chewing gum right now is a protest.  Spit it out.  Spit it out.  There you go.  Please.  We beg you.  Thank you.  All right?  All right.  More on the way.  If you wanted to dress up Rudy, just take the cover of the Daily News, do what you have  to do, and fax it into us.  212-957-WNEW. 
[00:10:00]  Kramer!  My new girlfriend gave me a handjob, and her wedding ring gave me a rash.  1027-WNEW.  The Rock of New York with the latest from the Goo Goo Dolls.  That's Slide off Dizzy Up the Girl and Neil Young before that, Cinnamon Girl.  And that was the song you had to be listening for this hour to win the Kiss tickets.  And Steve Sillery of Hopewell Junction, New York was paying attention. 
[00:10:30]  And now he has a pair of tickets to see Kiss.  Congratulations, Steve.  Very good.  Next hour, I'll give you the song right now.  You've got to be listening for Cuts Like a Knife by Brian Adams.  When you hear that, be the 10th caller at 212-757-1027.  You're hanging with Opie and Anthony.  Good afternoon.  And we do indeed love faxes.  Fax line is 212-957-WNEW.  And this fact's pretty interesting, Anthony.  Leave Giuliani alone. 
[00:11:00]  He is a great mayor.  He should be president of the United States of America in the future.  Before he became mayor, everyone bitched about the cabs, the crime, the porn.  He should be applauded for what he has been able to accomplish.  I went to NYU, and it was really bad.  Now it's so much better.  Give him credit.  He's a hell of a lot better than that stinking Dinkins.  Before Giuliani, the city was a toilet.  Appreciate the differences he's made.  And he's a man of honor.  And he doesn't take any S. 
[00:11:30]  All right.  That's what New York City needed.  I'm from Jersey, and I'm proud of the job he's done.  You, too, should be, too.  Actually, I'm happy with the job the mayor's done.  Look, exactly.  He's done a great job.  But he gets on to some ridiculous campaigns.  I don't care if my toll collector doesn't smile and say, have a nice day.  Thank you.  I don't care about that.  I've accepted the fact that they're pretty much robots at the toll booths,  and they don't want to deal with the people.  That's fine.  Just give me my change, and I'll move on.  I don't want any discussion. 
[00:12:00]  I want, like, you can roll your car through the toll booth.  Yeah.  I don't even want to stop.  Yeah.  So the thank you and stuff, no problem.  But if they want to give it to me, it's an extra bonus, and that's great.  But I don't care.  And how Julianne's cleaned up.  He's making a big issue of that.  Go ahead.  How he's cleaned up everything?  Mm-hmm.  And I agree.  I think he has.  But think of it this way.  If you're sitting in the living room, and someone comes in, your mom maybe, or your wife,  and she starts vacuuming the carpet, cleans the carpet up, but doesn't shut the vacuum off 
[00:12:30]  and keeps going and going and going, you'd get annoyed.  After a while, sure.  That's what he's doing.  It would get to you.  Like, what's with the gum on the sidewalks?  It's kind of silly.  Is that a problem anyone has even addressed?  Do you, does it bother you, Opie?  I've never looked down on the sidewalk because I'm scared to know what I'm going to see down there.  Yeah.  Don't look down.  Yeah.  Just don't look down.  Stepped in gum, I've never.  It doesn't bother me.  If you live and work in New York, you shouldn't look up.  Leave that to the tourists. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  And don't look down.  Just look straight ahead.  And to the side.  Who cares what's on the sidewalk?  There's bigger problems in the city still.  That's it.  There are bigger problems.  We should put that question out to our listeners.  What do you think the mayor should fix?  Or what do you think he'll fix next if he's onto this gum issue?  There are bigger problems.  Get rid of the stinky subways.  Get rid of the guys with the suitcases filled with the fake watches.  I don't want to see them on every block.  Those don't even bother me, quite frankly.  Yeah, but I'd rather see them go than the gum stains. 
[00:13:30]  Right?  Gum stains.  Gum stains.  He's worried about gum stains.  Is this maybe a misprint?  Was he saying gum?  Maybe we're just reading it wrong.  Yeah, I just thought of something, too.  But unfortunately, this is radio.  If this was the Internet, we could really speak our mind.  All right, so if you want to get in on the discussion today, 212-757-1027.  I believe we've got Gene Simmons calling us in a few minutes, so stick around for that. 
[00:14:00]  And keep the faxes coming as well.  212-957-WNEW.  I don't think anyone's using the instant feedback today, huh?  No.  No, WNEW.com.  Use your brain, please.  We like that.  On the way, we've got some Clapton and the Wallflowers next.  1-0-2-7-WNEW.  The Rock of New York.  The latest from Johnny Lang.  That's still raining off Wander This World.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You've got to stick around and listen for Brian Adams playing Cuts Like a Knife.  When you hear that, be the 10th caller. 
[00:14:30]  212-757-1027.  And you will win tickets to see Kiss.  And we should have Paul Stanley checking in in minutes here, Anthony.  Yes.  Can't wait to talk to him.  Yes.  What are you looking at in the paper?  Well, you're a putz head, Opie.  What do you mean I'm a putz head?  You're a putz head.  What do you mean I'm a putz head?  Well, that's what D'Amato called Schumer.  Oh.  Alphonse D'Amato.  I know.  Called Chuck Schumer. 
[00:15:00]  That campaign is getting so ugly.  It's the funniest thing, man.  You watch the commercials on TV?  Mm-hmm.  And they are just pounding each other.  Yes.  Charles Schumer, when he was 8 years old, rang a doorbell and ran away.  Do you want a senator who runs away from responsibility?  Come on, Chuck.  They fought my friend of Alphonse D'Amato.  It just goes back and forth.  I'll be honest.  I could care less about that election. 
[00:15:30]  They hate each other.  But I could care less.  Will my life personally change?  That's what I always ask myself when I vote for these politicians.  Nothing seems to change.  They promise you the world.  And I'm still getting taxed up to my eyeballs.  Yeah, that's a big problem.  Paying tolls just to get into the city every day.  Nothing changes in my life.  I could care less who wins these elections.  Well, I think it would be better to keep D'Amato in than get this Charles Schumer in there.  Why?  I don't know.  Chuck Schumer seems a little too on the liberal side for me, quite frankly. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  I don't like that.  Do you think that will change things, though?  Probably not, Opie.  I'm being honest.  You know what I mean?  But I don't want to, you know, take that chance.  I love when, like, you vote for the president of the United States of America, and they talk about how they're going to cut taxes by, like, $50 million.  And you're looking at the TV commercial, and you're like, wow, he's going to cut taxes by $50 million.  This is great.  I'm going to be able to buy that new car that I always wanted. 
[00:16:30]  Then you go to your calculator, and you figure out exactly how much of the $50 million you're going to save, and it turns out to be, like, a dime.  That's great.  That's when I'm like, oh, you guys are full of ass.  Well, I think the person that bashes the other guy the best should be in there, because that's the person you want in Washington fighting for you.  I think they should just have a cage match.  Yeah, they could do that to duke it out.  A celebrity death match like MTV does.  The winner actually wins, though.  I don't know, though. 
[00:17:00]  Then I think Charles Schumer would win.  Yeah.  Hit Alphonse D'Amato in that big light bulb head.  Doesn't it look like he has a light?  He looks like the brain from Pinky and the Brain.  I want to be the senator from New York.  I'm going to rule the world.  Oh, that's funny.  He does.  He's got that big light bulb head.  Oh, well.  All right, very good.  1027 WNEW, the rock of New York.  Brian Adams cuts like a knife.  That was the song you had to be listening for this hour to win the tickets to see Kiss. 
[00:17:30]  And Carol from Hoboken, New Jersey, was paying attention.  Now she has a pair of tickets to see Kiss when they come to town.  The tickets, of course, going on sale Saturday at 9 a.m. through Ticketmaster locations.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hoboken.  Hoboken.  Oh, I'm dying.  Remember that?  Even as an adult, every time you hear Hoboken, you still think that.  You have to do that.  Of course.  Okay, speaking of Kiss, we've got Paul Stanley on the line here.  Hey, Paul.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:18:00]  Hey, man.  How are you?  Pretty good.  Thanks for calling in today.  We really appreciate it.  Well, I'm literally on the road.  I'm on my way to rehearsals.  Where are you right now?  I'm on the, let's see, this must be the San Bernardino, I don't know, this is some freeway.  What do I know?  I'm from New York.  Very cool.  Out on the coast.  I must tell you, the last time you guys came around, it was the most fun I've had at a rock show in many, many years.  Well, isn't that what it's supposed to be?  You know, some people seem to forget that, you know, just because it's rock and roll doesn't mean you can't have fun and have a good time. 
[00:18:30]  You know, you want bad news?  Read the newspaper.  I'm not there to give you bad news.  We're there to entertain you.  Yeah, the angst was starting to get to me.  All the bands looking down at their shoes and stuff, you know?  You know, I figure if a band is going to look at their shoes and you're going to look at shoes, look at our shoes.  I mean, I got eight-inch heels.  Hell.  Yeah, you guys got the best shoes of all.  That's right.  They're busy staring at their combat boots.  I want you to look at my eight-inch leather heels.  Very cool.  Yeah, we saw them with the fire and the blood, and it was just classic kiss. 
[00:19:00]  For us to get back together in the original lineup, the only way we would do it is if we were going to pick up where we left off  and do, you know, classic kiss, there's no surprises.  The only surprise is how good it is.  And this tour is going to be in 3-D.  You've got to explain that a little bit.  I don't want to overemphasize the 3-D part because, first and foremost, you know, we're back on tour.  The band sounds better than ever.  We're doing at least two hours.  Last time it clocked in, I think we're playing about 22 songs, 23 songs. 
[00:19:30]  And the lights are awesome.  The pyro, you know, the bombs, all the stuff, it's all there.  It's enough to take the roof of the building off.  And then, additionally, we're using 3-D technology.  We're using these massive screens behind us whereby when you put on your kiss 3-D glasses that you get when you come in at certain points during the show,  I do my best, you know, to get into the guys' faces and the women's laps.  I mean, that's really what it's about.  Cool. 
[00:20:00]  It's kind of interactive in the sense that, you know, we're there and we're interacting with you.  So it's really state-of-the-art 3-D technology, but additionally, the sound is awesome.  The lights are awesome.  The pyro is awesome.  We have this amazing circus traveling with us because as much as I like a lot of other bands,  most of the time people who come to see us usually wind up saying, why'd you have so-and-so opening?  Right.  You know, so what we did this time is we're bringing out a circus.  So far we have a dynamite lady who blows herself up. 
[00:20:30]  We have a ball of death with motorcycles going around, avoiding each other inside a steel cage.  I've seen that.  That's real cool.  Yeah, so we have a whole lot of cool stuff because I think that it's much more of your money's worth  to see something that you want to see than to hear a band you don't want to hear.  Why didn't you guys get the whole lineup together a little sooner?  Because we didn't want to.  There were times we weren't getting along.  There were times where a lot of us had some growing up to do.  And everybody was always wishing, all the fans were wishing that we would get back together. 
[00:21:00]  But I always say, never wish for anything that you're going to regret getting.  And if we had done it at the wrong time for the wrong reasons, I think people would have been very disappointed in what they saw.  You know, we have this great history, this legacy and this legend of what we did.  And for us to come back and kind of tarnish it would have been horrible.  So, you know, we waited until I needed to do it or we never would have done it. 
[00:21:30]  We waited until we were ready to go out and really, like, blow the roof off.  I mean, we set a level of what we did before and we had to be able to go past it.  Because for us, we not only have to live up to our past, the reality of our past,  we have to live up to what people remember, whether it's accurate or not.  So, you know, it was serious stuff for us.  And at this point for us to go out, if anybody had any doubts before, you know, we're doing this because we love doing it.  I mean, this was the largest grossing tour of the year last time we went out. 
[00:22:00]  So if we were doing it for money, it would be all over.  Yeah, without a doubt.  You know, we really love what we're doing and we're really excited to go back out there.  So we're fired up.  I have to drive literally an hour and a half every day to rehearsal.  Wow.  Because we're rehearsing in an airplane hangar.  Oh, cool.  Yeah.  Boy, I wish I could drive an hour and a half to go to rehearsal for my job.  That's cool.  You're lucky you don't have to drive an hour and a half to work. 
[00:22:30]  Are you kidding?  From Long Island into Manhattan?  Come on.  Long Island.  Long Island, yes.  You know that's an hour.  Okay.  What exit?  We're way out in the Arlington area.  52.  Wow.  Yeah, exactly.  Hey, Paul, you guys have seen a lot of Kiss paraphernalia over the years?  You betcha.  What is the strangest thing you've seen?  Oh, man.  Because I've seen like the pinball machines and the board games and the color forms.  Yeah, the paraphernalia is not that weird because it's never a surprise to us because we okay everything, you know, that goes out in terms of the paraphernalia. 
[00:23:00]  You okayed a doll without a penis?  Well, you know, that was at that time of sexual repression.  They were afraid that I would screw Barbie.  That's all it was.  I hear you.  You guys got to come out with some Kiss condoms or something.  We had them.  You did?  Yeah, we had them a couple of years ago on tour.  And I can't really endorse them or anything. 
[00:23:30]  They might leak.  They're a bit snug.  Hey, what's up with this Kiss movie I hear you guys are making?  There's a really cool movie called Detroit Rock City.  And it's a 70s film.  It takes place in the 70s.  And it's kind of like a coming-of-age film about four young people on their way to a Kiss concert and all the stuff they go through getting there.  And it's very, very cool.  Matter of fact, in about two and a half weeks, we're filming a concert sequence where we're going to basically have an audience of about 5,000 to 10,000 people dressed in 70s clothes. 
[00:24:00]  And we're going to do Detroit Rock City.  Wow, where are you doing that?  We're doing it in L.A.  I think at the L.A. sports arena.  It's a chance for our fans to be immortalized by being in the film.  That's cool.  So the film's really cool, and it's shooting as we speak in Toronto.  Very good.  What was your first concert you went to, Paul?  Do you remember? 
[00:24:30]  First concert I went to Yardbirds.  Yardbirds?  Yeah.  Yardbirds with Jimmy Page.  Wow.  I would have loved to have seen that.  And after that, I saw Hendrix Experience a couple of times, you know, with Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding.  Right.  And I saw Zeppelin when they were playing for, you know, like 1,500 people.  Damn.  So I got in early.  I mean, it's going to be awesome to come back to New York.  I mean, it means so much to us, you know, having grown up there. 
[00:25:00]  And, hell, I was a cab driver.  I remember dropping people off at Madison Square Garden, you know, or driving past Nassau Coliseum, you know, or watching Meadowlands get built.  So, you know, when we come back to the New York area, it's very, very cool for us.  Now, when you were a cab driver, did you pick up anyone famous?  No.  Really?  No, I never had anybody famous in the cab.  Yeah.  No, I had all the, I don't want to say the losers, but I didn't have anybody famous. 
[00:25:30]  One day, this shows you how out there I can be.  One day, I picked up this guy.  He's sitting in the back.  And I keep looking in the mirror and thinking, this guy's a famous actor.  I don't know what film he's from, but this guy's really famous because I know his face so well.  So, I keep looking at him.  I never figure out who it is.  And then he gets out of the cab.  And for weeks, I'm trying to figure out who this guy is.  And one day, I'm sitting in my parents' living room where I was living at the time.  And I look out the window, and I see him walk by, and I realize he's my neighbor. 
[00:26:00]  Very good, Paul.  Hey, with that, we're going to let you go, okay?  Hey, take care, ma'am.  Have fun at rehearsal, and we can't wait to have you back in town here.  We're giving away kiss tickets all day long here, by the way.  They'll be for the lucky.  The rest have to go out and get them because if you're not there, you can either be there or you can be sorry, one or the other.  All right, everyone.  It's Paul Stanlay.  Take care, ma'am.  Thanks, Paul.  Bye.  Hey, you're hanging with Opie and Anthony.  REM looked really, really good last night. 
[00:26:30]  I do believe they're going to be on Letterman tonight.  Tonight and tomorrow night, right?  Mm-hmm.  What are you doing over there?  I'm computing.  Oh, that's what I do.  So you don't care what I say?  I was listening to it.  Oh, okay.  Just like a listener.  Oh, you can include me.  So did it work?  Yeah.  Oh, good.  I was listening.  Oh, thank you, Anthony.  Okay.  Here's their latest from their up CD.  This is Day Sleeper.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WADW.  Stone Temple Pilots.  Dinner State love song.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:27:00]  Lots going on today.  We're still giving you chances to win tickets to see Kiss.  Everyone is totally into this.  Later on this hour, we're going to play The Police.  Every little thing she does is magic.  When you hear that, if you're the 10th caller at 212-757-1027, you too will have a pair of  tickets to see Kiss when they come to town.  Kiss.  We had Paul Stanley on earlier.  He sounded great.  He sounds very psyched for this upcoming tour.  Yeah.  The thing I thought was really cool is they're not going to have an opening act this time  around.  No, they've got all kinds of like a freak show going on. 
[00:27:30]  They've got a woman that explodes herself.  Yeah.  They're doing a circus act.  Yeah.  A little circus act before Kiss comes in.  And I would almost guarantee they're going to open up with, welcome to the show, Psycho  Circus.  Sure.  So, all right.  It's kind of hard to do a show today because the whole town is just excited about the Yankees  victory last night.  Unbelievable.  We said it.  A sweep.  We said it early that they were going to sweep, but I guess that was pretty obvious,  huh?  Yeah.  Everybody knew.  It was the only way this season could end, really, was with a sweeping win of the series, 
[00:28:00]  the way the Yankees played.  And then we got the big parade tomorrow.  But those Padre fans, oh, put your towels away now.  Go hang them on your wall and tell the story of how you were at the World Series.  And they're all crying on their husbands' shoulders.  They're waving them.  Actually, a lot of the guys were crying, too.  Did you see that?  Yeah.  Fox cameras, first of all, can just zoom in on any open pore on your face.  Is it necessary that Fox cameras have to, like, just get every single hair on anyone's 
[00:28:30]  face?  Did you see Andy Pettit?  Yeah.  Did you see that?  Yes, I did.  His nose almost broke the camera lens at one point.  I believe he needs to trim some of those hairs.  It's like, we didn't need to see that, you know?  They just have that Fox camera.  We're going to bring you right in, up Andy Pettit's nose.  Here it is.  Here's the pitch.  And you're seeing sinuses and mucus.  Like, Fox, back off a little.  It's okay.  Yeah, it's all right.  We don't need that view.  Sure.  But the fans in the stands over there in San Diego, they were all whipped into a frenzy. 
[00:29:00]  They thought they were going to be the first team in history to come back from a 3-0.  Come on, Padres!  Woo!  We're going to do it!  It's our team!  Woo!  Yeah!  Hell, those Yankees scoreless!  Ride!  Woo!  Oh, an RBI.  But you're supposed to win!  I thought I was going to see a victory. 
[00:29:30]  I came to see my team win in the World Series.  Why are we being swept?  I brought my towel to wave.  Yes.  The woman with the ball.  She had that big ball.  What was that?  With her dirty rag hanging off of it.  And she put the ball against her head.  Mm-hmm.  And, like, pray, I guess.  Well, that didn't help.  No, did it?  I brought my ball.  The ball makes them win. 
[00:30:00]  How did this happen?  We're supposed to be the winners.  No, not this time around.  Sorry.  Ha, ha, ha.  Better luck next time.  And, obviously, the post-celebration was some great TV.  Whoa.  We've got to get into that again.  We talked about it earlier.  There's a whole new audience talking.  George Steinbrenner.  Was he drunk?  What's the matter?  Oh, it's not the old boss of 1978 who wanted to crack some skulls and fire someone. 
[00:30:30]  I want to remember the George Steinbrenner like the little claymation figure in the Lipton iced tea commercial.  Yeah.  Where it's like, you know, where the babe is like, I can't make it, Reg.  You know?  And he fires Billy Martin.  Yes.  You're Billy.  You're fired.  Yeah.  That's the old George.  Not this whiny, blubbering mess.  Blubbering.  Uh, I don't know what he was.  Well, can I give my analogy again? 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  What did George look like last night?  He looked like the retarded kid at the fair after he just told the retarded kid that he  can't have another corn dog.  Did you see him staring at the Big World Series trophy?  Yeah.  Oh, this is the best team ever.  And what about him crying because what's his name?  He's giving him the trophy and he's known him for so long.  To accept it from you, this man I've known for 21 years.  He was a mess. 
[00:31:30]  And you know who he looked like?  Yeah.  Corky.  When Corky grows up, he's going to look just like Steinbrenner did last night.  Like Corky from Life Goes On.  Yeah.  We win the World Series.  Bob Day, good boy.  We win the World Series.  Give him the shiny trophy.  Give him to me.  We're the champions.  Champion of the baseball. 
[00:32:00]  We win.  Give to me trophy.  My name is Georgie.  They call me Georgie.  I want to take the Yankee.  I'm the winner of the Yankee.  Winner of the baseball.  Corky Steinbrenner.  I felt bad for him.  He looked all weird.  Yeah.  His face was all distorted.  I told you we won the...  We win the World Series.  My best ball game. 
[00:32:30]  All right, George.  Take a trophy.  I love this.  You're not for Taiwan.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bye.  Georgie.  It's okay, Georgie.  And to top it off, he's dressed like Crazy Eddie.  Crazy Eddie, yes.  Did you see him?  He's got the white turtleneck and the blazer.  The Yankees are insane.  Crazy Georgie.  We're practically giving them away.  Take Bernie Williams.  Take the stadium.  I'm giving it all away. 
[00:33:00]  I'm insane.  Did we win the baseball game?  Oh, my baby.  Georgie.  Buddy, you're a wise maker.  Big time maker.  We win the baseball game.  I got...  My name is Georgie.  I don't think I can.  We win the baseball game.  We win the baseball game.  We win the baseball game.  And you're trying all over the place. 
[00:33:30]  We win the baseball game.  My name is Georgie.  I own the Yankees.  We win the baseball game.  We win the baseball game.  We win the baseball game.  We win the baseball game.  We win the baseball game.  You're a mess.  My name is George  Vivant of a 7 
[00:34:00]  Corky Stein  Hi, N.E.W.  Oh, hi  I just have to tell you guys the best  You are so hysterically funny  I'm not one into making fun of recorded people  But that was hysterical  We were making fun of George  I know, but you know  And it's early F.U.S.  The first person that complains about that  It's coming, trust me  I know  And, O.B., love that laugh  Oh, thank you  Okay  Alright  Bye  Bye 
[00:34:30]  You've got to see his face 
[00:35:00]  We need to be on TV right now  All right  Someone just drove off the road somewhere  We've got the ladies from Letty Kravitz on the way 
[00:35:30]  And the Rolling Stones next  Hi, what's up?  Nothing  You guys are hysterical  You guys  I love that  And they say I have a grammar problem  Just got off work  Relaxing  Oh, cool  What made you laugh today?

[00:36:00]  I'm sitting going to get gifts  And I'm like, wait a minute  I can't shut the car off  And the Indian's waiting for me  And he's banging on my window  How much, how much  And I'm just laughing  And I play it louder  And he's like, oh, okay  Well, he looks like Corky  Growing up last night, huh?  Oh, man, that was too funny  Yeah  They win the game  Now I need a lollipop  To build the Yankee win  Oh, boy  Anthony's got another observation for you  On the game last night  Why?  Did you take a look at Tony Gwynn's head? 
[00:36:30]  Tony Gwynn's head  Looks like the surface  Of Fred Flintstone's bowling ball  I don't know what's going on  It had, like, pits in it  And, I don't know  Like, it'd been left out  On the driving range too long  Did you see the other game  They were zooming in  And they were like, look  There's a moth on his hat  Yeah  For the Padres  Yeah, that  They were like, it threw off his  Throwing and pitching  And, yeah  Yeah, right  The moth is, like, you know, spit  But I love when they zoom in  No, yeah, like the moth weighed  Ten pounds  And it threw off his throwing  Yeah  Right, yeah  But, like, the zoom-ins 
[00:37:00]  What is with that?  They show the guys in the dugout  They're either spitting  Or shooting snot out of their nose  They just gotta get a life  And just go back to just  Showing us the game  The stupid stats  And the moth  All that has to go  And the sound effects  When they're showing the guy's stats  Let's pull up his stats  All right  Yeah, it looked like the beginning  Of Melrose Place  They were showing the guys  In the side profile  Front profile 
[00:37:30]  With the Melrose music  In the background  And do we need the  Biore strip cam  On the pitchers?  You see how close they  I think they breathe right  It's like right on his face  But I have to tell you  My whole entire family  Listens to you  But my brother is like  He's nuts over you  It's just too hard  You  He called me laughing  Where are yous from?
