<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts engaging in sexually suggestive and profane banter.  A caller, Dan from Hoboken, described a bizarre incident at a Brian Regan comedy show where a man was found severely injured and bleeding in the bathroom.  Further calls discussed a potential repeat airing of a show segment, audience heckling at Regan's shows, and the poor performance of "A Night at the McCools," starring Andrew "Dice" Clay, whose past inappropriate behavior with young audience members was also mentioned.  Listeners shared varied experiences at Regan's shows, some praising his performance, others criticizing disruptive audience members.  The hosts then transitioned to listener feedback on a recent *Sopranos* episode, with many expressing disappointment.  Other TV shows, including a midget wedding special and an upcoming Bellevue Hospital documentary, were also discussed.

"Balloon Guy" (Sean Yaney) from "Boot Camp," and Jennifer, a contestant in the show's "Whipped Cream Bikini Contest," appeared as live guests. Yaney recounted his grueling experiences on the show, including harsh treatment and lack of privacy. Callers peppered Yaney with questions, often crude and sexually suggestive, about his balloon-making skills and boot camp experiences.  The conversation frequently digressed into discussions of other reality TV shows, callers' personal lives, and celebrities, consistently using vulgar language and offensive jokes. A Paisano's restaurant advertisement aired during this segment.  The hosts also promoted a New Jersey golf course tee time booking website and continued promotion of the bikini contest, all interspersed with more crude and sexually suggestive conversations.

The show then shifted to a discussion about a seemingly underwhelming *Jackass* episode featuring a lengthy interview with Johnny Knoxville and Chris Conley, which the hosts attributed to MTV's declining ratings.  Numerous listener calls followed, covering a wide range of topics: Canby's mother's relocation; a humorous supermarket anecdote; a fifteen-year-old caller, Brian, asking an awkwardly phrased question about female anatomy; a skywriter's potentially obscene creations; further discussion of the whipped cream bikini contest and its rules; the failed attempt to get Sarah Jessica Parker on the show; a listener's complaint about a perceived "good cop/bad cop" routine regarding female attractiveness; the sexuality of a *Survivor* contestant; a bizarre story of a test with the SEC; speculation about Eddie Van Halen's cancer; a listener's reaction to a lawsuit against *Jackass*; and a request for a plane crash sound effect.  A comedic bit impersonating a Seinfeld cast dealing with drug abuse was used to promote Frank Caliendo's upcoming performance.

A significant portion of this segment was dedicated to a lengthy and explicit conversation with Mendy, a whipped cream bikini contest contestant, who was openly criticized by Opie for her body type. The conversation centered around Mendy's perceived attractiveness, her selling of used underwear, and a contentious exchange about body image and the contest format. A caller claiming to be "The Godfather" (the original, not the WWE character) joined the discussion, adding to the segment's chaotic and vulgar nature. Janie was mentioned as being in the studio creating balloon figures. The segment concluded with further discussion of the contest and the day's chaotic events.

The final segment featured Kimmy from *Survivor* as a guest. The hosts discussed rumors about Kimmy, including a new vibrator and her relationships with other show personalities, notably Jim Norton, who was repeatedly labeled as gay. Kimmy discussed her appearance in a whipped cream bikini on *Extra* and her parents' reaction. The hosts challenged her to promote the show by exposing herself on national television. "Drudge Jr." called in with gossip about Eddie Van Halen's cancer (incorrectly using "cornucopia") and Jenna Bush's alleged involvement in a pornographic video.  Several commercial breaks included ads for Planet Java iced coffee and a contest to win a trip to a *Survivor* town hall meeting. Sean (Yanny) was present in the studio, his presence becoming a running gag. The conversation remained sexually explicit and crude, with frequent discussions of bodily functions and listener calls contributing to the vulgar and nonsensical banter. The segment concluded with promotion of the whipped cream bikini contest and giveaways.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Something, how do you think it's happening here?  There's something wrong with us!  How do we play with them like him?  Something very, very wrong with us!  What the little kids are getting to the delinquency of a binary, healthy, and handsome age show?  It's really bad, but it's really good!  1027 WMW  Nice head, dick.  Let's go while we're young!  Oh, ah!  Whoa, whoa, whoa!  How's that for a topper? 
[00:00:30]  Sweet, merciful crap!  Your balls are healing!  Shut up, bitch! That's funny!  Fuck, fuck, fuck!  What the hell were you thinking?  I'm over here now!  What are you thinking?  What are you thinking?  I'm over here now!  She was over.  Whoa!  That you said! 
[00:01:00]  I was sick of it!  That's it!  Get on your hands and knees like a dog!  That's it!  Fall around like a dog!  I thought I'd moanied and shut up!  Oh, fuck!  I was a beast of it!  That's it!  Got to resolve the pretty little target!  I'm so funny.  I say you're like something. 
[00:01:30]  Looks like Chuck's taking the old log to the beaver.  This place blows.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  See, the NMCA pocket.  He's got some soggy paper.  What is up?  All right.  The O'Day Show, 212-757-1027.  Monday.  Yes, God damn Monday. 
[00:02:00]  Whoa.  They always roll around once a week.  But don't worry, we're going to rock.  We're going to have a good time all this week.  Guaranteed.  We've got to keep our streak alive after that amazing week of radio last week.  What's wrong, Anthony?  I'm just reading some of the phone calls coming in.  Well, actually, Dan from Hoboken didn't even write this one, and he's calling it in.  Dan from Hoboken.  Dan, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, I just wanted to say I went to see Brian Regan on Friday night.  Yeah.  And first of all, he freaking killed. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  I saw him at Governor's last night, and I got to tell you, yeah, he really, really killed.  Well, honestly, he literally killed, because after the show, when he took to go to the  bathroom, there was a guy, like, sprawled out on the floor, blood everywhere.  Some guy, like, fell down in the bathroom, I guess.  Fell in the bathroom?  Oh, and it was like a freaking crime scene, man.  It was like blood everywhere, puddled.  Like, you could see it in the cracks of the tile.  The guy wasn't moving.  That's great.  Hey, that's funny.  What a way to start a show. 
[00:03:00]  Brian.  Hey, look, I made him bleed.  Brian Regan literally made him die.  Well, I didn't see any gray matter, so I don't know if he was dead, but.  No, I'm sure he's okay.  Knowing Brian is just the nicest guy in the world, he'd probably know.  Oh, let me give your mouth to mouth.  I'm going to save him.  Cool.  All right, Dan.  Peace.  If anyone knows what happened to that guy, please give us a call.  I know the latest life-saving technology.  Let's go to Tony.  If you're calling in as Anthony, we're going to start calling you Tony. 
[00:03:30]  Hey, that's good.  Tony.  Could that be me?  Yes.  Yo, I want to know why they played the same show Saturday.  Well, Rick denies it happened, and everyone else around here denies it happened.  I wasn't listening, so I don't know for sure.  Well, I mean, it's a little bit.  They listened to the same show.  I laughed twice at that thing that Norton said about a mouthful of confusion.  What happened?  They replayed the same segment twice?  From what I heard, it sounded like, because I started listening at 11.  They were playing the thing with Norton and everybody in the studio.  Yeah.  And then at, like, 1 o'clock, I went back in, and it was on again. 
[00:04:00]  Huh.  The same whole section.  A lot of people are claiming that happened.  Everyone else is denying it around here.  I don't really care.  It doesn't matter to me.  So I don't know what the hell to tell you.  Eh, whatever.  All right.  A lot of people.  All right.  Later, boys.  Bye.  I've already read quite a few things that said that did indeed happen.  But, yes, I didn't hear it.  I tried to get to the bottom of it when I got in today, and everyone's denying that it happened.  So I guess it didn't happen, Anthony.  I guess our listeners are lying sacks of ass.  Right.  Ed, what's up?  What's going on, man?  I was at the late Regan show last night. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  Dude, he killed, but I feel bad for him, man.  People got to stop yelling out bits.  Doesn't that suck?  Especially with Ryan Regan.  He's not that type of comedian.  He's like a little circus monkey up there.  He's got to do whatever everybody says.  Oh.  You know, I was at the first show.  He absolutely killed, and the audience didn't heckle him once, and it was just a great show.  He knows exactly what bits he wants to do.  He knows which ones are going to work.  Yeah.  And then when people start calling out something from left field, it throws off his timing,  and it's not as funny. 
[00:05:00]  Just let him do it.  These people, not only, I was just telling Anthony in the elevator, they don't just throw  out a bit.  They throw out the punchline of a very long bit.  Yeah.  He's sitting there trying to listen to him, and all he hears, hey, dirt cup.  Right.  Dirt cup.  Cup with dirt.  The big yellow one's his son.  Now, I completely appreciate the first show of Governors last night.  All new material.  A lot of stuff I've never heard before.  He didn't do cup with dirt.  Wow, really?  He didn't do the big yellow one is his son.  He didn't do lousy and little league.  It was all new material.  Brand new stuff.  Yeah. 
[00:05:30]  From Brian Regan.  And it was a lot of fun.  He's like, you know, he's the type of comic that you've got to treat like an airline pilot.  You don't yell out, you go, left turn.  Right.  Left turn, dive.  Dive.  He knows what he's doing.  Leave him alone.  He knows where he wants to go.  He has all these bits, and he knows what he wants to do, what he's feeling.  Someone else, you know, you want to do that with Rich Voss?  Feel free.  Well, that's his type of comedy.  You walk away with your bung bleeding.  Right.  He's that type of comedian where he plays off the crowd, of course. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  But, matter of fact, after the show last night at Governors, Regan backstage said, hey,  I just want to thank you for making that announcement on the radio.  Don't harass the comic.  Yeah.  Because it meant a lot to him.  I know.  He could get into his zone and do his thing.  Jeff, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I caught the late show last night, too.  Brian just killed.  He was great.  Yeah.  But I have something pretty rare, I think, on your show.  I want to say something nice about Opie.  What?  I'm not nice about Opie.  You were leaving, and you were walking out with Rick and your girlfriend, and we were 
[00:06:30]  like, hey, Opie.  And you actually stopped and came across and said hello to us.  Hey, man.  Don't blow my cover.  Well, you know, you're actually kind of cool, so I figured, hey.  Hey, shh.  Okay, I won't tell anybody.  But you know what I was going to say?  You know that tool, Andrew Silverman, or whatever he's calling himself now?  Dice.  Yeah, him.  Did anyone see that movie?  No.  I haven't seen it yet.  Did you?  Night of McCools.  It's bombed.  It didn't even make, like, the top ten movies of the week.  Get out.  It came to, like, 12.  Like, Freddy Got Fingered beat the movie.  Stop it.  That dice has a small role in. 
[00:07:00]  I was just with my way back into the movie.  It's Fort Fairlane, Neuma Lemon, Neum.  Yeah, Freddy Got Fingered came in with $2.5 million for the weekend.  That's bad.  Night at McCools didn't even clear that opening weekend.  Didn't even make $2 million, it looks like.  Oh, my God.  I saw him two weeks ago at the Westbury Music Fair.  Yeah.  I saw him about ten years ago at the Westbury Music Fair.  And the only thing that was funny about the show was he had a 15-year-old kid in the front row with his parents. 
[00:07:30]  And he just keyed on them the whole show.  And was making him, like, smoke cigarettes and asking his mom, hey, do you blah, blah, you know.  Yeah.  This is what you get for bringing your kid to my show, you know.  Which way?  He did the same thing two weeks ago.  Jeff, I got to tell you, you know, at the Westbury Music Fair, I really enjoyed myself.  It was fun.  It was like going back in time ten years.  Ant and I have no problem abusing Dice, but he put on a fine show at Westbury.  He certainly did.  All right, Jeff.  Later.  Thank you.  Oh, there it is. 
[00:08:00]  I got the list now.  Let's go to Ian.  Ian, what's up?  What's up, Oda?  How are you doing?  Good.  Yeah, I met you last night, Opie.  I was walking into the bathroom and I stopped to shake your hands at the late show last night.  Yeah, I was in a weird area there.  Yeah, I know.  I just want to say, the show really was great last night.  The only thing I didn't like, though, was the heckling.  And during every joke, everyone started clapping in the middle of the jokes.  Brian had to stop.  He'd look at his face like, what the hell do I do now?  Oh, man, what happened between the early show and the late show?  Because there was none. 
[00:08:30]  I mean.  Yeah, probably.  There was nothing.  There was none of that going on in the first show.  Seriously, Chris, the late show was just, oh, I don't know.  But the show was still great.  He did all the new bits.  He did all the old bits.  The snow cone and all that.  They were great.  Hey, you want a tip from your pal, O?  Yeah, what's that?  If you're going to a comedy show to see comedy, and you're not going to get hammered and just  have just an incredible, you know, a good time all around, if you're purely going to  see someone be funny at a comedy club, go to the early show.  Right.  Yeah, I know.  I tried, but it was sold out. 
[00:09:00]  All I had was late show tickets, so.  Late shows are always tough.  Yeah, but it was so good.  Because like Anthony said, you know, they've had a few more hours to party.  Oh, yeah.  Because like if you're going to a 10.30 or I think Brewer did like a 12.30 show on Friday  night.  Wow.  Think about what the people are thinking.  It's like, well, it's 9 o'clock.  We got tickets for a 12.30 show.  Hey, let's go to Blah Blah Bar and have a few.  And who doesn't think they're funnier when they've had a lot to drink?  And the guy at the 8 o'clock show, and he hasn't had that much to drink, might be thinking  about yelling something out, but not do it. 
[00:09:30]  Now the inhibitions go out the window when he starts pounding them down.  The 10 o'clock show comes around.  Now he's like, what's this, man?  What?  Cup of Dirt.  Yeah, I know Cup of Dirt, man.  Look, now I'm getting like a thumbs up from the drunk at the other table.  Big yellow one's his son.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, but I just want to thank you.  That was pretty cool.  You actually stopped and like shake my hand.  That's pretty cool.  Oh, yeah.  I appreciate that.  All right.  Thank you.  Have a good one.  It's cool to shake someone's hand.  Of course we're going to shake hands and hang. 
[00:10:00]  Let's go to Jeremy, who saw A Night at McCool's.  Jeremy.  Yes.  What's up?  How you doing, guys?  You're still mad at McCool's.  I saw it last night, guys.  It was goddamn terrible.  I saw the previews.  It looked good, but I see Dyson.  He's just like played two characters.  Played two characters?  Well, I hear the movie just blows.  A dual role?  Yeah, it looked good in the previews, but he was just terrible.  Yeah, well, tell us what he does in the movie, because I will not even go.  I might rent it eventually. 
[00:10:30]  It looks like Liv Tyler's boyfriend, and they have the whole scam where he drops her off  somewhere, and, like, Matt, what's his name?  What's that guy's name?  Matt something.  Picture up.  He's doing a great job, O'Paino.  Come on, man.  I mean, doesn't he have long hair, and he's almost unrecognizable?  Yeah, he's like a biker dude.  And, like, you see him coming later, he comes and shoots up the bar, and, like, he ends up  getting killed by Matt Dillon's character, and then he comes back later as, like, this  nerdy guy.  He comes back for revenge of his brother's death.  Twice the dice!  Twice the dice! 
[00:11:00]  Twice the dice!  He said, I'm over here now.  He said it in the movie.  Yeah.  All right, Jeremy.  All right, thanks a lot, guys.  The double dice!  Traitor Jake, this is pretty funny.  Traitor Jake!  Traitor Jake!  O&A, how are you guys?  All right.  Guys, I've got to be honest.  I'm really disappointed with you.  Why?  Look, I mean, after Friday's show with Regan, I can't believe you're still promoting that  racist, filthy animal.  I don't know if I have to talk to the FAA about this. 
[00:11:30]  I'm just, I'm very upset.  Hey, that's funny, man.  Thank you.  You got it, guys.  Have a great day, all right?  He killed on Saturday.  Without a doubt.  Here's a guy that supposedly was in the bathroom when Guy passed out of Regan's show.  Ah, right?  Lots of blood.  Bobby!  Hey, what's happening, O'Day?  So the guy just passed out?  Dude, I had to use the, you know, the sitting toilet, and all you hear, because he's standing  at the urinal, all you hear is, boom, and a guy cracks his head.  Oh.  We go to lift him up. 
[00:12:00]  He's on the tile, right?  And there's blood gushing from his head, so we had to run out.  And they gave the ambulances there and everything within 10 minutes, but it was a crime scene,  like the other guy said.  Was the guy all right when they were taking him out of the club, though?  I never saw him open his eyes after that.  That's what I was wondering myself.  Oh, look at that.  Regan killed.  Yeah, he did.  All right, Bobby.  Thank you.  Talk to you.  I just want to make sure that guy was okay.  Ah, Mike, you're next on WNEW.  Mike Gay. 
[00:12:30]  Hello.  How you doing?  All right, Mike.  Oh, no.  You watched Backless yesterday?  I blew off Backless.  I have to see the Encore presentation, because I wasn't home.  Yeah, well, who do you think won?  Well, give me the choices.  I'll tell you who won every match.  All right, well, who do you think won the main event?  The main event was Triple H and Stone Cold against Kane and Undertaker.  Well, Triple H and Stone Cold won, obviously.  They all kept on babbling that Triple H won every title.  Yeah.  Super Redneck, J.O.  Was it good, though? 
[00:13:00]  It was all right.  It was all right.  Any, like, major storylines?  Did any WCW wrestlers come out?  Nah.  Did Shawn Michaels come out?  Nah.  It's just, like, really soft.  No surprises?  Nah.  God damn it.  WWF doesn't have enough surprises lately.  I know.  It's like business as usual.  Throw a surprise in there.  You've got all those WCW wrestlers in the wings.  You've got, you know, maybe a Shawn Michaels that could pop back out.  Something.  Just, yeah, show your face.  Give it up.  Give it something.  Naked.  Or, yeah, see, one of those fine ladies naked.  Nothing wrong with that. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Predicted that, Opie.  The Triple H Stone Cold thing on Friday.  Mike, what's going on?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Backlash last night?  Yeah.  Shane McMahon jumped off the Titantron around 50 feet and landed right next to the big show.  The guy's insane.  It was unbelievable.  We've got to get him back on the show.  The guy's insane.  He stole the show with that one move.  Did it look fake?  No.  It looked good until they showed the up close.  Yeah.  So he missed him by a few inches. 
[00:14:00]  But he dropped 50 feet on the table.  He didn't drop 50 feet.  Yeah, how did he do?  At least the top of the Titantron.  Come on.  It had to be a 20, 20 feet.  Jumped down.  Maybe 20 feet, which is still, that's insane.  Yeah.  He doesn't need to do that.  He has more money than God.  All right, boys.  You guys suck.  All right.  Didn't the Blue Blazer fall from about 20 feet?  Nah.  Jesus.  That was a little higher.  I'm waiting for him to come back.  It's all a gag, right?  Sure.  It's got to be. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, I had a great weekend, hoping.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I was up in the Poconos at the...  Mount Derry Lodge.  The Caesars...  Didn't you learn?  Didn't we do like a two-hour segment on the reasons not to go to the Poconos?  Yeah, we totally went like as a go.  Because it's funny.  And it was near the place we want to go horseback riding.  Right.  So we went there.  But all I kept thinking of was the horrific stories that we were telling about those places  here on the air.  You know, oh, sure, the heart-shaped jacuzzi looks all nice. 
[00:15:00]  But who was getting plowed in the dumper before you got in there?  And when you look around at the clientele that's there, it's not like all of a sudden there  was a supermodel, you know, a threesome of supermodels in the room before you.  So that wasn't happening.  There was this 50-year-old guy and this 50-year-old woman, 50-year-old guy with old man sacs,  gray pubes, you know.  You just, you got to put it out of your head, though, and hope they disinfected good enough. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, those places, I don't know why you would go.  Yeah.  Even as a goof.  The whole place looked like the audience at the dice show.  I was horrified.  I was horrified.  But no, we wanted to do some horseback ride.  So, uh, we, hello?  Hello?  So we went to the, uh, we went to the, uh, Cove Haven.  Caesars Cove Haven.  And I got, we are so spoiled. 
[00:16:00]  We have spoiled rotten as far as comics go.  You know, you're talking about seeing Regan.  Brewer.  Brewer, by the way.  Brewer.  Not to interrupt you, but it was a great weekend for comedy.  Brewer, Jess.  Killed.  Yeah.  Killed.  Yeah, he is a funny guy.  We've seen him, what, 10, 12 times?  Yeah.  Always new stuff.  Yeah.  He's got a lot of great new stuff.  But guys, so we get spoiled.  I mean, we're right here.  You go down to Caroline.  You see a name act.  You know, anywhere around the city.  So, you got these comics there.  One guy we were calling, uh, the not-so-amazing Jonathan. 
[00:16:30]  He was stealing.  I swear to God, this guy was absolutely verbatim ripping off the amazing Jonathan's act.  But it wasn't good.  Real, like, loud, flamboyant kind of, uh, magician comic thing where you bring people up and F with them.  But doing the same exact lines.  Horrid.  Horrid.  And then there was this, uh, black comic that was up there, uh, the first night.  And people in the, in the audience are just like, oh, my God, this, this guy's hysterical funny. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, they were just losing it?  Because they're Rubes from Pennsylvania.  You know, we, and we just get done seeing, like, Regan and, and Brewer and Jay.  Well, dice, but.  And, uh, we're watching this guy.  It's like, oh, my God.  This guy makes, uh, Chuck Nice look like, uh, Eddie Murphy.  Come on.  I love him.  All right?  That's all you got.  That's all you got to say to make up for.  Right? 
[00:17:30]  Love the guy.  Now, this guy was like, really.  And they say, I'm the troublemaker.  Really horrendous.  It's a joke.  He's got the comic.  He understands.  Jesus.  Yeah, staff party tomorrow night.  Uh, great timing.  Thanks, Ant.  Oh, staff party tomorrow?  Yeah.  That's cool.  Good business.  Like, you don't just knock around with people around here.  Stop.  It'll be fun.  No, I didn't run into Dreamweaver when I was on the horse.  And, uh, before we, uh, before circumstances change around here, um, and, um, and we can't 
[00:18:00]  talk about them, uh, we can't talk about it in a bad light.  Um, the girls in Pennsylvania.  Oh, my God.  I don't know if it's the inbreeding or something.  First of all, we stopped at this little ice cream place.  There's an eight-month pregnant woman smoking a Marlboro menthol.  And just, like, if you want to smoke and you're pregnant, do it in your house.  Because it's uncomfortable to watch. 
[00:18:30]  But then you keep looking, and she's looking like she's ready to go, my mama smoked too.  And I'm fine.  And she's got, like, these little kids.  And all the kids look the same.  They got these, there's some genetic eye problem going on there.  Because they all got the big Coke bottle lenses, blonde hair, and skin like Elmer's glue.  That's, uh, inbreeding, Anthony.  It is.  It is.  And there's all the trailer park trash up there.  All the vehicles that you go, you know, whatever happened to the old 7940 Conoline vans?  You never see them anymore. 
[00:19:00]  They're up there.  They all went to Pennsylvania.  All the old pickup trucks.  All those old vehicles that were cool.  And so many.  And the mullocks, like, I've never seen in my life.  You're going to ruin it.  Mullocks.  We're going to have a lot.  We're going to be entertaining these people in the very near future.  Oh, what?  Shut up.  What?  Shut up.  We've got to get it out now.  Yeah.  That's why we've got to get it out now.  How about those people in Cleveland?  What?  No, and, yeah, El Camino's. 
[00:19:30]  All these cars that, like, disappeared.  That were cool to drive in high school.  Like, all of a sudden, they're in Pennsylvania.  They export them.  You don't have anything bad to say to people that live in Memphis, do you?  The King was from there, wasn't it?  That's right.  What could you say, Ben, about that?  Ex-nay on the people that live in Memphis.  Memphis, eh.  Right.  Huh.  All right.  I was bummed because they didn't have an HBO in the room.  Mr. Sopranos.  No, we just saw it. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, we just saw the Sopranos before the show, and it sucked.  They've got to pick it up.  If it looks now, like next week, it looks like next week.  This was the week that was supposed to look, you know, be good because of the previews  last week.  It's a little more cerebral with the big pussy stuff.  If I have to see another, tell them what happens when, like, the scene comes on with  Tony and his therapist's office.  All right.  Yeah.  The scene cuts from whatever was going on.  Now, all of a sudden, Tony's sitting in the chair.  His therapist is sitting there.  They're talking.  Opie's sitting there. 
[00:20:30]  He just goes, oh.  Picks up the little basketball.  Starts shooting baskets.  Can we fast forward?  Can we fast forward?  Yeah.  Oh.  At least they didn't bore us with now her going to her therapist after talking to Tony.  She's a non-entity.  There was something going on, like, late last season where, okay, this could be interesting.  Maybe Tony starts an affair with her something.  But there's nothing going on with the therapist sessions.  Yeah.  Not the most exciting parts of the show.  A lot of people are like, oh, it's great. 
[00:21:00]  You know, I think the chicks like that.  Like, if anyone you talk to that's into the Sopranos, that they're girls.  And they're kind of like, oh, I like the whole therapist.  Oh, it's just the human angle of Tony.  I want someone dead.  I think the Sopranos were on spring break or something.  They got lazy with this episode.  It was only 45 minutes long.  It was kind of cool with the big pussy stuff, like earlier.  The big pussy flashbacks and stuff.  You know, it was kind of cool.  I don't know, man.  And come on.  Come on.  Oh, what the hell is that, Jackie Jr.?  Getting the crap beat out of him in the bathroom. 
[00:21:30]  The need to the bullies.  That was good.  I just want to talk to you.  But did we need it to be reminded of Christmas in late April?  That's weird, too.  I was freaking out.  I was getting all stressed out.  I'm like, oh, okay, that's right.  It's only a TV show, and I don't have to worry about buying Christmas presents for people I hate.  I've got to go Christmas shopping.  Anyone else feel the stress?  Like, wait a minute.  Why do I have to see this on TV in May?  It's practically May.  Well, their season covers the whole year, so they've got to go through that whole thing. 
[00:22:00]  I think that's what they're doing.  They call it Stressmas.  Stressmas.  I like that.  Which is good.  I like that a lot.  That's cute.  Sopranos blew, though.  Our buddy Igor got beat up pretty good.  That was pretty funny.  They didn't show.  Now, I wanted to see Igor getting the crap beat out of him.  That's why the episode sucked.  It's like, okay, they're finally going to rough someone up.  They don't even show you.  They show the aftermath.  You know, it's Igor.  It would be fun to see him just get, oh, please don't hurt me.  Getting the crap beat out of him. 
[00:22:30]  Tony, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey, boys.  It was pretty funny seeing him under the sled, though.  Yeah, that was all right.  The show was weak, though, dude.  Yeah, but now, next week, directed by Steve Buscemi from Reservoir Dogs and Fargo.  If there's not death and destruction with Buscemi directing, then I don't know what.  Hey, poor guy from freaking boot camp.  I just saw the poor guy here.  Buscemi's pretty twisted, man.  When you see Paulie Walnuts running through the woods shooting rounds off,  and he looks like he's been beat up a little bit, and Christopher's with him, 
[00:23:00]  now I'm psyched for next week's episode.  Nah, whatever.  Dude, I'll get it out quick, man.  Am I the only one who stayed up and watched the thing about the midgets?  Okay.  Let me have a midget show after me.  All right, listen.  Oh, my God.  Tony, I'm glad you brought this up.  I'll take the beating for it.  I laugh my ball even.  Tony, no, let me tell you.  And someone help us out and let us know when they're going to rerun this thing,  because I'm pissed.  I went to Brian Regan at Governor's.  I get home.  I miss The Sopranos, and I turn on HBO.  I saw The Wedding, which was like the last five minutes.  Yeah, it looked like a... 
[00:23:30]  Midget Wedding.  Midget Wedding with a girl.  How tall is she, Tony?  About two feet tall.  No joke.  Looked like a cockroach marrying a worm.  Anthony, top, three feet tall.  Really?  Married a guy that had to be about, what, 5'6", 5'7"?  No, he was 4'11".  Oh, really?  Because he towered over her.  Yeah, dude.  He wasn't a midget?  Well, if...  He's a fidget.  Short guy.  A fidget.  Well, 4'11", but he towered over her.  He had to be on his knees just to be lip to lip.  Them's not babies.  Them's fidgets.  Oh, more disturbing than that, bro?  Did you see what that redhead did to herself? 
[00:24:00]  Who?  The one who had the lengthening done with her ligaments?  You know, I've seen...  No, listen, Tony, I've seen this.  Oh, bro, it was painful, man.  I've seen pieces of this.  What they do is they, like, don't they break the leg...  Yeah, they break the leg and they stretch the ligaments and they put screws in there.  Yeah, there's a big...  You release it, like, before it heals, make it stretch more.  Dude, she looked like she had the Rocky Dennis big pumpkin head and, like, normal-sized arms  and legs.  Dude, it was disturbing, man.  Rocky Dennis, man. 
[00:24:30]  They break the bones and then there's this big cage-like thing on the outside with a wrench.  The guy, like, does a couple of notches and stretches it out.  And the bone kind of heals and forms new bones.  So they've got to do it real slow.  Just to make them bigger or taller or whatever?  To make them taller, make their arms the right length.  Dude, she would have been, like, the five feet, one and a half.  Wow.  But it was painful, man.  Our ankles ended up giving out, the tendons in our ankles.  Was that the one with the guy that was, like, an athlete or something?  Yeah, he wanted to be.  Then he had the regular midget who was, like, a doctor. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, yeah, the doctor midget.  Yeah, it looked like Rocket Romano performing surgery when he steps on his crate.  When he comes in, if I was sitting in the doctor's office and all of a sudden a little  midget comes in where the stethoscope thing is at his knees, yeah, I'd be a little taken  aback.  Yeah, but, dude, I've got to give him credit.  His wife wasn't that bad looking.  Yeah, what did he have, a regular?  Oh, a regular-sized wife.  And his kid ended up being another fidget.  I saw this so long ago.  Hey, dude, play around with it.  Have fun.  Nope, I'll let your guy know when it's on again. 
[00:25:30]  Usually, they beat it to death during the week.  That's what HBO does, man.  All right.  Later, guys.  God, I'm so pissed I missed that.  You could drown him in a bathtub.  You know what's even better, though?  After the midget show, they showed, like, a coming attraction for that show, Investigator,  whatever they call it.  Not Investigative Report.  Something like that.  I know the show you're talking about.  Hidden, whatever.  They're going to do a whole show on Bellevue.  Bellevue?  And they show the coming attractions of people just losing their effing mind. 
[00:26:00]  That's where they go.  One lady that's looking in the camera and basically saying, you think, you know, mental, someone  with mental problems, you think it's funny.  And I was laughing because it was really funny.  Because it was funny.  You think it's funny?  Look at this.  That is funny.  Can't wait to see that next week.  Nice.  Bellevue.  All right.  We've got to take our first break.  We're just getting warmed up, obviously.  Hey, Balloon Guy is here from Boot Camp.  Is he going to make some balloon animals for us and stuff?  Oh, of course.  Nice. 
[00:26:30]  And what a better forum for balloon animals and whatnot than radio.  You'll get to hear all the...  We'll make it entertaining somehow.  Dwarfs.  Not a fairy tale.  HBO, Wednesday, 9 a.m.  That's when it's on next.  Wednesday, 9 a.m.  Set your VCR.  Oh, any donuts in the governor's parking lot this time?  Since the first time you've been back?  Harder on dry pavement.  The whole gang at governor's. 
[00:27:00]  Hey, you going to do any donuts tonight?  That old gang.  America undercover.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Nice.  Throwing a blank today.  Also, ladies, maybe you weren't listening Friday.  We have extended the qualifying for the whipped cream bikini contest.  We have a trip to Hawaii to give away so you can come down all this week to show off what you got.  We put you in a little whipped cream.  You show off your body.  And the listeners eventually will vote for their favorite and grand prize.  Trip to Hawaii.  It's huge.  I'm telling you, it's huge. 
[00:27:30]  And that's why we're extending the contest to get some more qualifiers down here.  And, ladies, don't be discouraged.  We have a girl so far today?  We have our first lady for today.  She's already here.  Got to tell the ladies, too, don't be discouraged if you go to the site and think a chick is hotter than you or something.  Because when this gets to the voting process of the listeners, they've surprised us every time.  With the boob contest, the ass contest, what we thought was going to be the go-ahead winner did not win.  Now, I got a couple emails today from people that said,  Look, I know my girl is hot and I want to bring her down, but, you know, Kimmy's going to win the contest. 
[00:28:00]  So I'm not even going to bother.  Look, Kimmy cannot win this contest, it looks like, because she's an employee of the same company we work for.  And I think that's in the rules.  Yeah.  She's an exhibition.  Yeah.  So Kimmy's picture is out there so you can check them out and go, wow, that's pretty cool.  But I think when it comes down to voting, she'll definitely be out.  She'll definitely be out.  So don't let that deter you.  Right.  Bring your hot girlfriends down here sometime this week while we're on the air.  And another person, you know, is someone going to call?  No, just show up with your girl. 
[00:28:30]  Just show up between 3 and 7 any time this week and get your pictures done, okay?  And Hawaii on the line.  All right.  We'll get the girl in next and we'll get the guy from boot camp in here as well.  The guy that makes the balloon animals.  Cool.  Does he know all the bad stuff we said about him?  We didn't say bad things about him.  We just said it was kind of ridiculous.  He wanted his balloons as the item that, you know, what item were they calling that?  One personal item.  Personal item, yes.  He wanted the balloon.  We'll see what he's about next, okay?  Well, he knows now. 
[00:29:00]  Wow, some chick is, her speech is slurring.  Wow, we got some great calls standing by.  O.P.E. Anthony.  We have our penises.  Hey, what's up, Weezer?  And cheese.  7 to 10, it's Brother Weez endorsed by O.P. and Anthony. 
[00:29:30]  At 10, Edutron cranked.  Pull this out, pull this out, pull this out, pull this out, pull it out, stop, pull it out.

No.  It's something going on in there.  What are they, pre-lube Anna the Party Sheep?  It's all dusty in there.  Dusty?  No one's used it?  Who the hell would, you know?  It's a novelty gag item, O.P.  I don't think it's meant to be used.  Although, I wouldn't be surprised.

Yes, adultshop.com.  You guys have, you guys have, you guys have redefined debauchery.  Your J.R.O. station.  1027.  Colby Anthony.  WNAW. 
[00:32:00]  Remember, you don't have to backsell retro cuts.  Only backsell the new tracks that we're playing.  Right.  The O&A Show, 212-757-1027.  It's a waste of time when you backsell the retro track.  Everyone knows what the song is.  What?  What happened?  You know what I heard on my way back from the Poconos? 
[00:32:30]  I was listening to, I guess it's a PDH and a Kitsie.  And you could also get in touch with us through our instant feedback.  Oh, yeah.  Sponsored by Volkswagen.  Oh, man.  We should have coined that phrase there, O.P.  Yes, we should have.  We should have patented it or trademarked it or something.  That's a cute little thing we started.  Everyone else uses it here at the station.  I just wish they would call it something else.  I know.  It's kind of weird when you call it the instant feedback. 
[00:33:00]  You're right.  We should have patented it.  Yeah.  We'll give it a little trademark.  And who knew, who knew back in, like, 95 that it would take off like this?  Wow, wow, wow.  Carrie, what's going on?  Hi.  You're from?  Yes, I'm from Pennsylvania.  Okay.  And I think you guys will be such a plea to try to see how I look if you want to check out my website. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, yeah.  Pennsylvania Bronx.  Yes, I'm also in the March-April issue of Playboy Lingerie.  Oh, you are?  See, Anthony, not everyone from Pennsylvania is a pig.  It's just where I was, I guess.  Do you want my website again?  We're going to have to make friends with all these people in Pennsylvania soon, you idiot.  What's your website?  It's verykerry.com.  V-E-R-Y-K-E-R-Y.  Sorry, I didn't listen to you because Rick holds up your website.  He thinks it's hotamishwhore.com.  Don't get involved with our whipped cream bikini contest. 
[00:34:00]  I thought about it, but I'm actually really, really busy.  I own real estate, and I have income properties and stuff, so I'm pretty busy right now.  All right, well, you know.  I will probably stop by sometime.  A lot of ladies out there are not being smart about our contest.  You come down here, you get in the whipped cream bikini, and you get the plug stuff, too.  True.  You know, if you're a dancer at a club, you come down, and we promote where you're dancing.  All right, well.  We want to up the ante in this contest this week, so ladies, come on down any time between  now and Friday and show off what you got. 
[00:34:30]  Thank you.  All right, Carrie.  Yeah, bye-bye.  Carrie, it's like members only and stuff.  Well, I do have sample pictures.  What?  I do have sample pictures, so you can kind of get an idea.  What happened to the porn?  Well, I'm not quite into porn.  I know, but you...  Wow.  Like the shower picture there.  Yes.  April showers do bring me flowers.  They do, do they?  That's very nice.  They also bring boners.  Yes.  That's the whole idea.  All right. 
[00:35:00]  All right, thank you.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  All right, she gives you a little taste.  Yeah.  We don't like promoting, like, paid websites, though.  No, no, but you know what it is?  Sometimes we don't have a choice because the girl gives us some great radio, but in general,  you know, you can't get anything for free anymore on the Internet.  But she did, she was on the phone, and now you can kind of see her.  Baby got back there.  Let me see.  Turn around and see.  Look at her ass.  Check this out.  Oh.  Like that extra layer, eh.  Yeah, she got, like, the ice cream scooper. 
[00:35:30]  I like the extra, extra layer.  It's very round.  Oh, yeah.  Like, it's a good extra layer.  It's not like a...  She's really hot.  She's hot.  All right.  Now I just have to check out what's under hotamishwhore.com.  Dave, what's going on?  What's going on, man?  Hey.  My son's going to be on TRL today, and he's wearing a little WOW shirt, and it says FBA on it.  Yeah, he emailed us. 
[00:36:00]  We're hoping that he gets on today.  Yeah, he said his, like, he's going with a class trip or something, so they're actually  going to, like, get into the studio.  It's pretty cool.  Yeah, we'll see.  We'll see.  If it happens, he can come down here and...  Yeah, he said he wants to come down and give you guys a shirt.  And hang.  We haven't got a lot of WOWs on TV this season yet, so...  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks, Dave.  All right.  Take care.  Bye.  Yeah, we've got to get Private Yaney in here from boot camp.  Balloon guy from Jersey.  And where's the girl?  Should we talk to the girl first that's going to get in the whipped cream bikini?  Our first qualifier for the whipped cream bikini contest for this week. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  Brand new week.  Hey, look at you.  Hello there.  How you feeling?  Hi.  How you doing?  Oh, my God.  Oh.  That was cute.  Did you buy that?  You guys are cute.  That was cute.  I completely bought it.  And I'm like, oh, no.  Did you see the look of horror?  I'm going to have to make fun of her teeth.  You know what's funny?  I wasn't sure what was going on.  Like, I didn't know.  It looked like they almost had gold teeth or braces.  You know what?  It shows they have a heart because I'm like, how am I going to, like, talk to her without 
[00:37:00]  talking about her teeth?  What's going on with her teeth?  She had fake teeth in.  And they were really bad.  You got it.  You got me.  You got me.  That's pretty good.  Put them in again.  Let me see.  Watch this.  It's like she's really hot.  And then she's got these...  I'm going to see.  Yeah, that's good.  She can't talk in them, but...  That's funny.  I love lying in the bars.  Really?  The funny thing is, I'm looking at Opie's face and he's got that look like, how am I  going to lie around this one?  Yeah, I know.  They're both just smiling like, hi.  I know. 
[00:37:30]  Like, hi, let's go.  It's kind of like a lion that sees an injured gazelle.  It's like, how do you pounce?  How do you enjoy it the most, you know?  So, what's your name?  Jennifer.  Hi, Jennifer.  Where are you from?  South Stambrook, New Jersey.  All right.  And yeah, she's got the nice body for the whipped cream bikini.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No question about that.  Are you psyched?  I'm a little nervous, a little chilly, but I think I'll make it.  A little chilly?  Chilly's not bad.  Yeah, I'm sure it's not.  It's better to hold on the whipped cream.  That's right.  Okay.  Can you wow us, or...  I'll do it. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, sure.  Oh, I'm going to warn you about some scar heads.  I'm going to warn you about some scar heads.  That's good.  It's going to be a creative warning.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  What happened with the scars?  Now there's a story to be told.  I had some freckles I had to be removed, skin cancer kind of worry thing.  I don't know it.  Oh, all right.  I'm really pissed off.  Why are you pissed off?  I'm trying to...  Because it bothers me.  Maybe you can't even see it.  Stand up.  Stand up.  Let's see.  Looks like you have a little bug bite.  No big deal.  Okay.  Let's see.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  And then I'm going up here in the middle with a gentleman's skin.  Oh, wow. 
[00:38:30]  Look at that.  Anyway, so that's the landscape of mine.  No, you look fine.  Yeah.  Without a doubt.  Yeah.  Let's see.  Okay, here we go.  Oh, yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Nice, small, firm set.  You could have pawned that off as just a bug bite.  Yeah?  Like, what's going on there?  Oh, I was scratching.  Bug bite.  Bug bite.  Okay, I'll do that next time.  Cool.  Yeah, we'll get her in her whipped cream, and then we'll talk to her after she's done,  all right?  Okay.  We'll take a look-see. 
[00:39:00]  Do you watch Blue Care?  Yeah, one with the teeth in.  Yeah, you should definitely do a shot with the teeth in.  Definitely.  Here she goes.  Here, bring in on Private Neenie.  Threw us for a loop with those teeth, Elfie.  I was horrified when she walked in.  And I saw your face, too.  You're like, uh-huh.  You're not even saying anything.  My mouth was watering.  I'm like, this is going to be too easy.  Hey, there's the guy.  Hey, look, he's got the big teeth in, too.  Oh, no, wait a minute.  No, of course.  We know.  Come on.  We all watched it. 
[00:39:30]  You got the braces.  What's up, Sean?  How's it going?  How did it happen?  I didn't even know your real name was Sean.  I'm used to, like, the drill instructors screaming Yaney.  Yeah, that's right.  Yeah.  I was shocked when you got kicked off last week.  I was shocked.  I thought you were going to win the whole thing.  I was hoping they were going to re-edit it so I could win.  Yeah.  So you could stay in.  That's the balloon guy, Anthony.  I see him right there.  And, boy, you got some crap from those drill instructors.  Yeah.  Right off the bat.  Look at me, you know. 
[00:40:00]  I made balloons.  I didn't do any exercise.  I was asking for it.  And you made the balloon thing, and he took the bite out of it on the first episode.  That was great.  Yeah.  I was going to tell him that it's a choking hazard.  Yeah.  I think it was good that you didn't say anything about that.  Don't you think, looking back, that it was kind of silly to bring your balloons to boot camp?  No.  I mean, you were just such a target after that.  Yeah.  Like, here's a guy from Jersey that makes balloon animals.  But, come on.  It was close.  They had, everybody's getting pictures of family and they're crying and all like that. 
[00:40:30]  And then I'm making balloons.  You asked for the balloons.  They're, like, getting back at everybody for everything.  Like, you didn't have any pictures of anyone that you wanted?  No.  During that time, you just wanted your balloons.  Now, how long have you been making balloon animals?  Like, seven years.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You just decided to start making them one day?  I'm doing a Grateful Dead concert.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You'd probably make good money doing that.  Yeah, it's good money.  Yeah, no, the deadheads don't have much money to spend on stuff like that.  But it's to sell them the spaghetti.  And the veggie burritos. 
[00:41:00]  Right.  And the veggie burritos.  So you just make the balloons.  That was pretty cool, too.  You made balloons for everybody.  You made the little superhero hat with the...  Who was that running around like a superhero?  That was Wolf, right?  Yeah, Wolf was running around as a superhero.  And then when the instructors came in, they were mortified.  What are you doing?  So that was an insane show.  I'm trying to think what I could ask you.  Yeah.  Like, I don't know.  Did you get the crap beat out of you? 
[00:41:30]  Doing some of the stuff you were doing?  There weren't a lot of touchy, right?  I don't mean like beat up, but just the physical...  You don't really look like somebody that really was maybe the head of the class in gym or something.  Yeah, I think I was...  I haven't done anything really since gym class in high school.  Nothing physical.  They worked me pretty hard.  Yeah.  But you roll with the punches.  Yeah, you didn't fall down or anything.  I fell down.  You didn't pass out or anything.  We went through a crazy run, and then everybody got dirtied. 
[00:42:00]  We were just dirty.  And then they made us run through the water to get better, you know, to get all clean.  So we're washing off in the water.  And when everybody's running out of the water as fast as they can, who tripped?  I tripped, I tripped.  Yeah, that's no surprise.  Oh.  Oh.  A couple rows.  Swing around.  We took it at night.  We were all hanging out and getting to know each other, writing letters and having fun.  We were wrong.  You were only sleeping, what, like four hours a night, five hours a night? 
[00:42:30]  If that.  When did you know it was just going to be bad?  I knew the first night, you know, after we ate dinner, and I was going, whoa, when are  we going to party?  When are we going to hang out?  When are we going to party?  There you go.  This is wrong.  I made a mistake.  So what was the first thing they did to you guys?  I mean, they yelled at you when the bus pulled up, and then you went and ate, and then, you  know, what was the first thing they did?  It was just PT.  It just gave us PT and training.  And I think that was, when I got off the bus, that's when I realized I made a mistake. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, when they started yelling at you.  They told us we could take one bag.  We could fill up a bag with everything we wanted in it, right?  So I was like, all right, fine.  I couldn't fit everything in my bag.  So I went downstairs at the hotel, when we were at the hotel, and I got a box, and I thought  it was, like, a little smooth.  I was like, I'll just get a box, and I'll fill it up with stuff.  And I was like, as far as I knew, we were going to give them the bag, and we would never  see it again until we got to the camp.  So now, we're coming off this plane, we're walking out to this plane, and I see everybody's 
[00:43:30]  bag lined up on the runway, and I'm in the suit, and all I see is the box on the end  of the runway, and everybody walks up to their bag, and I was just going, I made a mistake.  I looked like I was unemployed.  I was just sitting there going, this is great, on national television.  The other guy with the box.  A box and a suit.  Yeah.  Very cool.  Well, we got to take a break.  Yeah, we got Yaney in the studio from Boot Camp, the balloon guy, and a lot of people

Anything you want.  You name it, I'll make it.  Really?  Is that good?  What's the wildest thing you make?  We want something that's just going to blow us away, like a giraffe or something.  Who cares?  You want a giraffe?  No, something like...  Oh, maybe a giraffe.  I can make a good giraffe.  I bet you can make a good giraffe.  I'm sure you can.  Yeah.  All right, we'll figure it out next, okay?  It's Opie and Anthony's Whipped Cream Bikini Contest.

[00:46:30]  Yeah.  Just come on down.  You don't even have to call.  Just show up.  It's like a party here.  Sure is.  You just got to drop in.  And we got balloon guy from boot camp, Yaney.  Sean Yaney from Jersey.  And he's going to talk to us and make something.  What are you going to make, Sean?  He's going to make a mermaid.  He's going to make a mermaid.  He's got the balloon pump.  It's like a thing, you know, like a big air syringe that he's filling up the balloons  with so he doesn't have to blow them up.  Get dizzy. 
[00:47:00]  Are your parents proud of you?  Yeah.  My mother wanted a doctor or a lawyer.  She got a superfluor.  She's a balloon guy.  All right.  Nothing wrong with that.  Oh, you blow them up, too.  Those are hard to blow up.  Oh, you got to know how to do it.  Yeah, that's right.  No, it hurts.  Karen.  You get that wacky hurt feeling in your cheeks like you popped something.  Hey, Karen.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  I just wanted to tell Yaney that he did a great job as a troop leader and that he was  also awesome that he sucked up about the harness incident.  Yeah.  Even the harnessing thing and everything. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, no.  It was the chick that left her harness behind.  It turned out it wasn't Wolf.  Was that ever decided for sure that that was the case?  They showed it near the end of the episode that it was the chick.  And not Wolf and not Yaney.  I can't blow up the balloon.  You can't blow up the balloon.  I hurt myself.  I felt so bad for him when he got voted off because I really thought he was doing so well  towards the end.  I was kind of bummed because he was entertaining.  He was kind of goofy, making balloon things and stuff.  It was entertaining.  Yeah, it was great.  He did a great job representing New Jersey.  You're a trick to this. 
[00:48:00]  All right.  Thank you, Karen.  Take care, guys.  Love you.  You got to do a good kiss.  Well, I just want to know if there's a trick to me.  You can't blow that up.  No, you try, I hope.  I'm not trying.  Grab one and try.  Why?  Ow.  Oh, see?  You get that hurt feeling.  Hey, Joe, what's up?  What up, fellas?  What up?  What's going on?  Oh, I almost had it.  Hey, it's hard.  I think you're going to...  What did you do?  You got to stretch it, right?  You just got to blow.  You just got to blow.  You got a question for Yanny, Joe?  Yeah, I want to know if they're really that mean, first of all, or they're just doing that 
[00:48:30]  for TV.  No, they were meaner.  Really?  They were brutal.  Like, they didn't show you in the morning when...  They showed them screaming at us in the morning.  They didn't show the garbage can flying all over the barracks.  Really?  They're running around like nuts, and you're getting dressed, and then they're telling you  to get undressed, and then they're telling you to get back in the bed and out of the  bed.  You have to make your fellas...  You've got to watch that asshole.  I want to know, when you got kicked off, did you make them like a cute little balloon  animal to give to that guy?  Yeah, at the end, I made them like balloons real instructive. 
[00:49:00]  All right.  That's it.  Thanks, Joe.  Bye.  Yeah, you brought your balloons as your personal item, whatever you want to call it, whatever  they're calling it on boot camp.  Everyone else had pictures of their family and stuff, and then they would cry when they  saw the picture of their family.  I thought that was kind of silly.  Yeah.  Balloons, I think, were a lot better than pictures of my family.  Right.  Gary.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  My real name's Vinny.  I don't know why I lied.  That's all right.  I don't care.  Hey, and, uh, Rock at Rules. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, thank you.  Yeah, and, uh, I want to be on that, uh, Foundry Music, uh...  Wait, Gary.  You've got a question for Yaney?  You're boring everyone here.  Yeah, okay.  I, yeah...  Hold on.  Okay.  Yeah, and I...  Wait, wait, wait.  You want to know if he, uh, pleasured himself, I guess you could say.  Yeah.  Am I going to be on the, uh, Foundry Music, uh, Dompleist now?  No.  I'm not?  Nope.  Um, yeah.  Uh, well, I guess everybody that's been on the reality shows has gotten me a question 
[00:50:00]  asked.  How long were you there?  We were there for about two months.  Two months.  Now...  Wait, you were there two months?  It was eight weeks.  Eight boot camp weeks.  It was about two months.  But you didn't make it the whole way, so...  What?  They put you somewhere else for a while?  Yeah, when I got off, I went...  When I was kicked off the show.  Right.  When you got off would have answered the question.  And where did this take place?  It took place in Jacksonville, Florida. 
[00:50:30]  Jacksonville.  I thought it was Florida.  I was trying to figure out where.  And, uh, what'd you do?  I mean, that must have been kind of, you know, you got, you got needs.  It was rough.  Yeah?  Very rough.  But there was no privacy.  None?  None.  None.  Wow.  All right.  He's making a mermaid.  Must have been some homecoming.  You know what I mean.  Let me go with Bill Lewis.  Lewis, what's up?  Hey, real interesting radio.  Balloon blowing guy.  Real interesting radio.  What's he doing now? 
[00:51:00]  Is he blowing two balloons in the shape of DJs in New York City?  Easy, Lewis.  He's making a mermaid.  I just, I got some serious questions for the guy.  Okay.  I'm just curious.  I mean, did this come about through a natural talent or through dateless Saturday nights jerking your jank?  A little bit of both.  Oh, okay.  He probably makes good money on the streets doing this stuff.  Sure, man.  And now you're like the guy.  Yeah, he probably.  You're like the top guy in the field now.  He probably couldn't get, he lost the job house with the, uh, you know, with the guy with the music box.  He couldn't be the monkey. 
[00:51:30]  We should send him out on the street to do this.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Hold on, though.  Wait.  I just got to breathe after laughing so hard at Lewis.  He's always so funny.  He helped out the show on a daily basis with his humor.  So, hey.  What's up, you pickle sniffers?  Hey, what's going on?  Nothing.  I wanted to ask Yanni if he's, you know, good at blowing up balloons.  Is he an expert at the balloon knot?  Yeah.  You know what a balloon knot is?  I know what the balloon knot is.  Right.  Of course. 
[00:52:00]  The balloon knot.  Stay away from the balloon knot.  These are tight balloon knots.  It looks like you're getting it more than you're giving it there, buddy.  Well, that wasn't nice.  He's our guest today.  I can't blow this mother-effing thing up.  What's the trick?  Chris, what's going on?  Yeah, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, uh, a little background on Yanni is that he went to high school with Jay Moore, first  of all.  Did you really?  Yeah.  Same year and stuff?  No, he was, uh, two years ahead of him.  Two years ahead, okay.  Verona?  Verona High.  One becomes a Hollywood actor and another guy becomes a balloon artist. 
[00:52:30]  That's cool.  The balloon thing's got to be fake, though.  What do you mean?  In our yearbook, I went to high school with Sean, and it predicts that he was going to  be a balloon maker traveling around the world.  Like all the other girls with the big hair in class were hairdressers, and it predicts for  Sean to be a balloon maker.  A balloon maker.  Well, he's making the balloons.  Is that really your job, Sean?  Yeah, that's what I do.  Well, it's not my only job.  What else do you do?  I'm a graphic designer. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, see?  Now, where do you do your balloon art, man?  Weddings, bar mitzvahs, corporate events.  Oh, so they hire you to do this?  And now, you've got to be, like, the top guy in the field.  Yeah.  Because there's got to be guys that are doing balloons that are like, God, I wish I was that  guy.  You know?  Every field has the guy.  Now, are you getting a lot of calls?  Yeah.  I bet.  Yeah, I want to start dressing up in fatigue and yelling at the kids.  There you go.  Get back at him.  That's great. 
[00:53:30]  You did a little corkscrew number there.  That's pretty...  I can't even blow the goddamn thing up.  Bobby!  I can't blow it up, Gilman.  Bobby.  Yeah.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  I want to know if you ever did, like, a stag party and did any X-ray of balloons with  rubbers.  Yeah, do you do any X-ray of balloons?  Well, using condoms is very difficult because you can't tie them up so well.  Right.  Now, especially with your junk in them.  Do you make X-ray of balloons, though?  Yeah, I can make it.  I'll make it some X-ray of balloons.  You'll make it one?  Absolutely.  It's kind of taking shape, whatever you're making over there. 
[00:54:00]  Keith, you can't do it either, can you?  His face is turning beet red, and as a trope, you can't blow it up either.  Nah, I can't do that.  Jason.  I'll pick Kev.  Jason, look at the wrong power you got, Kev.  You rule, Kev.  Jason.  Yeah.  Hey.  What's up, Jason?  Not much.  How are you guys?  Good.  Jason, you're on the radio.  I can hear that.  All right, so let's go.  All right, well, last week when Black Girl came to William Patterson University, our television 
[00:54:30]  network, WPBM-TV, got an interview with him.  Oh, yeah?  And I have your address.  I want to send the tape in to you guys.  Hopefully, you guys will play it.  Oh, we'd love to hear what Earl had to say.  Hey, do you have the audio right there?  We'll play it on the radio today.  No, I don't.  If I can get it, I'll call you guys back.  All right, that's cool.  Hold on a line.  We'll give you an address, okay?  All right.  All right.  He's going to hear the creaking of the balloons and people trying to blow him up and passing 
[00:55:00]  out.  Jim, what's going on?  I can't do it.  Hey, Yaney.  Yes?  Hey, how do you feel about Meyer, like, faking injuries and stuff, man?  Meyer rocks.  We knew he was faking it.  He was entertaining.  Thompson and I were talking to him in the beginning, and I didn't want him going anywhere  because I knew he was in a threat to me anyway.  Meyer was the whole show, man.  Oh, Meyer was a joosh.  Yeah, but that's why he was good.  Jim, don't you understand?  I mean, the show got a little kind of boring after Meyer left. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, whatever.  Yaney, you did a good job of everything, man.  I was calling for you.  Thank you very much.  All right, guys.  F Iowa.  Later.  All right.  An eye is going to pop out of my head before this thing blows up.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, I got a question for Yaney.  Yeah.  If you put a small prick in a balloon nut, does it leak more?  If you put a small prick right there in the balloon nut, is it going to leak more or less  than if you put a prick maybe in the side?  I think it'll leak a little bit more.  A little more?  All right.  There's the answer to your question.  Thank you, Mike.  There you go.  Sounds very good.  Fred. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  Yaney, first.  Your albums really suck.  I hear them in all the elevators.  It's Yaney.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  Do you prefer the type of balloons you use?  Are they latex or are they lambskin?  They're latex.  Ah.  The lambskin, is it more comfortable and more sensitive?  I think that the, I trust the latex a lot more than I do the lambskin.  All right, Fred.  Thank you.  All right.  All right.  What balloons are best for a mole that want to transport a heroin or cocaine or whatnot 
[00:56:30]  in their bowels?  Would it be these?  The blue one.  The blue one.  What's going on?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  How's it going?  All right.  You used to work with Sean when this all started.  Yeah.  Sean, do you remember?  I'm Billy's cousin.  What's his name?  Mitch.  You're your famous guy now.  I know people say, hey, you know, Mitch.  It's so funny.  When at first, Jerry Garcia show, we were backstage and we were doing all these balloons.  You guys see it.  You open-ass.  You see it.  You know, like people turn different when they know you're famous and they treat you different. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  You know, how many times did you get laid because you were in the band?  And it was amazing, the pull of just being the balloon guy.  Really?  The balloon guy was able to, like, work it?  It's stupid.  I got hummers in parking lots from working concerts.  Being the balloon guy.  You know, I go to a concert, no money, no nothing, ready to go.  I got a pack of balloons.  You're walking out with a couple hundred bucks, ears, bones, the hummers, anything you wanted.  People are just out of their mind.  Well, there's something to be said for the balloon guy just being able to blow it up. 
[00:57:30]  Thank God.  That's the hardest part I have to show when your face turns beet red and your head's going to explode.  Keith, you got it.  He wasn't going anywhere.  Are you going to make something out of all that?  Yeah, I'm making something out of all that.  Jesus Christ.  I'm thinking you can't do it either, right?  No way.  And you could blame it on years of pot smoke, but you can't.  I can't do this.  All right, we're ready to see what you can do with this.  He's really been working on this.  He's making something big. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  Cool.  He's got, like, this corkscrew thing going on, and then he twists them together, and then he, like, breaks some of them.  And what happens if some piece of that breaks?  Then I'm in trouble.  Yeah.  Start all over again.  Oh, damn.  What's that happening?  The whipped cream lady's back.  Hey, but she's dressed.  What happened?  Sorry.  It's sober.  You missed it.  They're supposed to tell us when you're naked, though.  Yeah.  I told you what I'm naked.  I'm walking in an announcement.  We're watching balloons.  Did you give her pictures to Scott?  Yeah.  All right. 
[00:58:30]  Her pictures will be up on WNAW.com very soon.  Okay.  We'll take a picture of Yanni's balloon thing, too, to put up on there.  It ain't working.  Give it up.  I don't know how the hell you do that.  It's impossible, Galvin.  Oh, he's braiding a little bit soon.  Stink, man.  You're going to lose a long time trying to blow that up.  Al, what's up?  Yeah, I want to ask Yanni.  How do you think you're doing a real boot camp when they really took you and really  cut your hair and you really didn't get to go home and see your loved ones for eight 
[00:59:00]  weeks at a time, and then they shook your ass off to Vietnam?  Yeah, that was just a take, right?  Off to Vietnam.  And the gooks are shooting at you, and all of a sudden, you blow up a balloon, and they're  amazed, and you win the war.  It would have been peace.  Right.  I'd have been like, wow, balloons, great.  They didn't really take me away, and they didn't really cut my hair.  Right.  Do you have any funny stories about boot camp?  Sure.  Let me think for a minute.  We had bees in the cafeteria. 
[00:59:30]  Bees in the cafeteria.  Bees in the cafeteria.  So the drill instructors thought it would be appropriate to get rid of the bees in the  cafeteria by designated two recruits to be bee grunts, who had to line up and go, bee  grunts, reporting as requested, sir.  And then go in and kill as many bees as they could, as they were, bee grunts.  Right.  So.  Were you one of those?  I think it was a bee grunt once.  And they didn't show this on TV?  Nah.  Not too bad. 
[01:00:00]  It just had too much footage.  Did anyone get stung?  Yeah.  Somebody got stung.  Oh, yeah?  I'm ready with a Y got stung.  All right.  Let's see what you got there.  Still nothing.  We're going to be in another few minutes.  Another few minutes?  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  Okay.  This is the mermaid you're making?  Yeah.  Dave, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, man.  Hey, honey.  Who ordered the code red?  Who ordered the what?  Who ordered the code red on you, huh?  Who ordered the code red?  Yeah.  What does that mean, Dave? 
[01:00:30]  You got no idea, do you?  No, I don't.  That's why I'm asking.  You never seen that movie?  This guy's killing me.  What are you doing?  Dave, help us out.  What do you mean?  You know the code red.  Oh.  If we knew, we would have.  Lenny.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  How are you?  Good.  Listen, I was just wondering what, I really dug Moretti.  I thought she was like, she's pretty hot.  Right.  I was just wondering if Yanni got to see any of those girls with anything less than those 
[01:01:00]  horrible fatigues that they always were.  No.  No.  Did he think any of them were like really, I mean, they don't really show their bodies  that much.  I mean, who really had the best body?  You know what?  Where boot camp screwed up, they cut all the hair off, the ladies.  Yeah, but you know what?  Moretti has, I mean, I think that haircut really did her well.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  I didn't think any of the women were hot.  Moretti looked good with that haircut.  Yeah.  Moretti looked good with her haircut, too.  Yeah.  Coddington.  Coddington was better with long hair.  Better long hair?  Yeah, I did.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Lenny. 
[01:01:30]  All right, guys.  Bye.  Jason, what's going on?  Hey, how are you doing, guys?  What's up?  I think you guys are terrific.  Andy, I have a question.  Remember when you and Wolf were on that mission and you lost a piece of equipment?  And let me ask you, how do you felt that he betrayed you and he actually took your piece  of equipment and then framed you for it and then you got in trouble for nothing?  See, everyone's got the story wrong.  That's not what happened in the end.  What happened was Moretti left her D-ring and rope in the tunnel, but she said to Wolf,  she said, here, take this with you when you leave.  Right. 
[01:02:00]  So, I mean, it's not really his responsibility.  I didn't know who left it in there, so I wasn't going to finger anybody.  Really?  It took a lot of heat.  Yeah.  Wow.  You know what I'm so disappointed, too?  Recruit Hootek.  I mean, she's a deputy sheriff and I'm at NYPD top and I felt bad that she was missed  the boot camp.  She was really terrific.  Right.  Well, she really gave a hot out.  She was the only one who should have been there.  She was doing good.  It was a shame.  All right, guys.  You guys are great.  Thanks, Jason.  Stinky, what did you make?  A whipped cream balloon.  That's whipped cream in there? 
[01:02:30]  You know what happens if that pops?  It goes in big head space.  Is it blown up with the nitrous?  Yeah.  Oh, do a whip it.  Evan.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I have a question for Yanni.  Yeah.  What made you want to go on the show overall?  What desired you to go?  I did it to meet a girl.  What?  I did.  I got an email from somebody, and they were looking for clowns for a survivor-like show.  So I was like, what is this?  What are you going to make us put big shoes on and red nose and go on an island and try 
[01:03:00]  to survive?  And I called in, and I asked what it was all about.  And they said it was a Marine Corps boot camp.  And I said, there's no way I'm doing that.  Right.  And she said, oh, no, you should come down.  I'll be down there.  And she made me an audition, and the next thing I knew, I was going to do it.  Also, one more question.  Yeah.  How did you get picked for the show, though?  We had to send in a four-minute video, and I think it might have been my video.  They got me in.  Were you making balloons stuff?  Yeah, I was making balloons.  I did a little couple bits on my video.  That would be a riot, though. 
[01:03:30]  All of a sudden, you're popping these tapes in.  It's one after the other.  And then you see this guy making balloons.  You're like, we've got to get this guy out again on boot camp.  All right, Evan.  Well, thanks a lot, guys.  You're rule.  Thank you.  Oh, I'm dumbfounded.  Have you been able to blow yours up?  I tried once.  I'm not going to care.  Who cares?  Oh.  Here's the pump.  My cheeks feel like $5 hookers.  Jesus.  All right, we'll take a break.  All right, he's continuing on The Mermaid. 
[01:04:00]  What part is...  You don't like that one?  No, it wasn't the wrong balloon.  The wrong balloon.  More with the balloon guy from boot camp.  Stay there.  212-757-1027.  Hey, what's up, motherfuckers?  This is Carlos Mencia, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony  talking some s*** about every s*** that you can.  We're going to do some n***a jokes, some spit jokes, some chink jokes,  some f*** jokes, and if you're a midget, we're going to talk about your ass too 
[01:04:30]  on 1027-W-Anytime.  Hi, Anthony Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  Yes, you'll love Paisano as we do.  Paisano of Mulberry Street.  It's right there in the heart of Little Italy on Mulberry Street.  It's all the romance of Italy, warm, friendly, relaxed restaurant.  And believe me, after eating pasta in Pennsylvania,  well, I could still get some jabs in at Pennsylvania Open. 
[01:05:00]  The limited time that we have left to jab at Pennsylvania.  Did you like anything in Pennsylvania?  You didn't like the comedians.  The room was...  No, the room was cool.  But you were a little disturbed because you weren't sure what was going on there  before you got in that room.  Horseback riding and effing.  And effing.  That's great.  Everything else was like, we're in Pennsylvania.  Pennsylvania, Poconos, you know, Poconos, rock, the Poconos.  The mullet is still a popular hairstyle, the mullet capital of the world.  Yeah, all right.  But the pasta is like, oh, my God, you go in this, you know, at that Caesar's place, 
[01:05:30]  and you figure you're going to get some linguine or some ziti or something,  and it's just awful.  You can't get good Italian food in Pennsylvania.  Go to Paisano of Mulberry Street.  You should have ordered the big scrott.  I didn't go with the scrott.  I went with the steak.  Steak?  Good.  Well, I had some of the pasta, and it was really mushy.  I'd imagine the steak was bad.  Well, it's not like a New York steak. 
[01:06:00]  You got to do something with the horseback horses.  And it was funny.  And then they die.  She asked how I wanted it, and I said medium rare.  And then I had to turn around to my girlfriend at that point and just go, yeah.  But when I said it, she had asked me if I also wanted onions on it.  Onions.  And when I went, yeah, she thought I was saying yeah to the onions, and she brought onions on it.  They got a lot of onions.  Had to scrape it off and stuff.

[01:07:00]  Talk.  Talk.  Talk.  Talking out of one's butt crack.  Anthony.  It's a fight of personal confidence.  Opie and Anthony's show.  One, two, seven.  Really tasteless, not funny.  Seven, eight, seven.  It's the O&H show.  Hanging out with Yaney from Boot Camp.  Balloon guy.  He just made a mermaid.  Yeah, I know.  And you know what?  I have to give it to him.  I looked right at him and said, how the F do you make that?  We're going to get pictures of it and put it up on WNAW.com. 
[01:07:30]  Very, very good.  I'm serious.  Easy to goof on you and stuff, but man, that's pretty impressive.  Also, Jennifer's pictures are up from the photo shoot that we just took.  The first girl to qualify for the whipped cream bikini contest this week.  Are they up now?  Yeah, there's a few up, but we've got to get more up.  We've got to get some of the pictures up with the bad pee.  She's pretty funny, man.  Go to WNAW.com and check out Jennifer's pictures.  Hopefully some more ladies will come down today.  You can come down any day this week, ladies. 
[01:08:00]  This trip to Hawaii up for grabs, all right?  212-757-1027.  Fletcher, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, you guys brought some bad memories about talking about Pennsylvania.  Ah.  Good job.  I used to live there, right up by where you used to go, up Caesar's Palace, whatever?  Yeah, they've got that Caesar's, a couple of the Caesar's resorts up there.  I love how they call them resorts.  Yeah.  It's their goddamn room.  You know, anything else?  They're the worst.  Mullets, Camaros, the fat ladies, no teeth. 
[01:08:30]  I couldn't stand it.  They've got them back in Jersey.  The entertainment is insane.  Oh, my God.  I'm just sitting at the bar drinking, hoping that the more drunk I got, maybe I'd get a  chuckle out of these comics.  Oh, it's the worst.  Hard.  The worst of all time.  Did you have a good time, man?  You're bitching.  I had a great time.  A lot of the stuff that went on.  No, let me tell you, I had a great time because it wasn't based on doing the things that they  deem entertaining.  Right.  You know, we went off on our own.  We'd do whatever the hell we wanted to do. 
[01:09:00]  But the entertainment that they have there for you, and then the dinner.  When you go to dinner, they prop you at a table with like three or four other couples  you don't know.  But there was a couple from Wisconsin that came there after a 16-hour drive after their  wedding.  This was their honeymoon.  They came there.  And we were just like, oh, my God.  You're going to spend 16 hours somewhere.  There better well be a goddamn palm tree when I open the door. 
[01:09:30]  Like you said before, you're spoiled here.  I used to go with my friends to go see comedians there.  And I would laugh hysterically.  And then I moved back here.  I go up to Caroline's.  I'm in glory.  I love it.  Yeah.  All right.  Like ecstasy.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  Thank you.  You shouldn't have got kicked off, man.  I don't want to give the wrong idea.  I had a great time.  But if you're just going there to do what they want you to do, what are you going to  do?  Why do you eat with the people then?  Because it was like dinner.  And I thought it would be a goof.  You know?  That's a goof. 
[01:10:00]  It's kind of a goof.  But if you go there as any more than a goof, then it's kind of like silly.  But, you know, if you're going with somebody that has a good sense of humor and you could  laugh about it, it's great.  You know, you sit there and you get back to the room and go, oh, my God.  Did you see that couple from Wisconsin?  Did you have the heart-shaped bed?  No, no.  The bed was round and it did not vibrate.  It didn't vibrate.  It was round.  We did an experiment with some glow-in-the-dark paint, which is kind of fun, throwing glow-in-the-dark  paint at each other. 
[01:10:30]  In the bathroom, you turn the lights on.  It looks like nothing.  When the lights are off, there are body part prints all over the walls of the bathroom.  So the next people that come in, when they turn the lights off, they're going to get  a surprise.  It's going to look like a crime scene.  Yeah.  And it was splattered everywhere.  It was horrible.  Let's go to Bill.  Bill, what's going on?  It was funny, man.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Listen, Anthony, you definitely are Suffolk County white trash.  Why is that?  He doesn't live in Suffolk County.  What's that?  You can't take the Suffolk County out of us, though, L.P., I guess. 
[01:11:00]  Why is that?  You guys are lighting fires when you were kids.  I mean, come on.  You can't get any more white trash than that.  Yeah, okay.  So there you go.  We're going to embrace our roots.  All right, Bill.  Why not?  You can't just go out and have some fun?  Hey, Yanny, what are you making over there?  What are you making now?  I'm going to make a little alligator for you.  An alligator?  An alligator.  A mean-looking alligator.  Did you take pictures of the mermaid for the website?  Instead of getting more naked girls down here, we're going to have balloon animals 
[01:11:30]  and things.  Let's go to John.  John, what's going on?  Yo, what's up?  Hey, man.  What's going on, bud?  Talking to you.  Yo, I got a question for you, ain't he?  Yeah.  How did you feel, man?  That one girl was supposedly the only friend.  Didn't you not vote for her and that she dragged you off with you?  Well, she was concerned.  I mean, everybody kind of lost their mind a little bit.  There was a lot of things that happened that nobody really saw. 
[01:12:00]  I know we were in the chow hall and we were eating and Brown and Moretti were real upset.  And all of a sudden, I just flipped out.  I just freaked out.  I was like, we don't like abused women.  And out there are alcoholic husbands.  And they were just like, yeah, he lost his mind.  Did you hear him?  He just freaked out.  So she was just concerned.  She was like, are you all right?  I'm like, yeah, yeah.  Did you want to leave when she did?  No, I didn't want to go.  I didn't want to leave at all.  I don't think anybody that put that much effort into something wanted to leave.  Yeah, man, I'll tell you, I felt real bad for you. 
[01:12:30]  Because when I went through boot, I was basically you, but for real, you know?  I mean, I got abused like you wouldn't believe.  I was like six foot tall and 140 pounds.  It was just like a beanstalk.  Oh, man.  Beat the hell out of me, man.  Hey, could you make a balloon bikini?  Sure.  Get a girl down here.  Hey, ladies, come on.  Get to Hawaii.  Yeah, the next girl that comes down, we'll make a balloon bikini for you.  Balloon bikini, and then you can put that on.  That's kind of cool.  Yeah.  All right, John, thank you.  All right, bro.  Bye.  Hey, I have a question for you.  The guy that had to leave because, like, his heart was going to explode. 
[01:13:00]  He's like 29 years old.  Right.  From like this, I think it was the second weekend.  Thompson, yeah.  Thompson, thank you.  Whatever happened to him?  What was his problem?  We have no idea.  He just started to blow up.  You haven't talked to him since?  He was trying to blow up one of these goddamn balloons, I think.  We just thought he had a heart problem or something.  Yeah, because his feet and his hands were swelling up.  He said his body went into shock.  Right.  Jackson has a theory, but I don't know what his theory is.  But they kind of hinted that, you know, this guy could have a heart attack at any moment. 
[01:13:30]  Right.  And then they didn't do any updates, and none of you guys have talked to him since?  Well, we've talked to him since, but nobody knows what it was.  I mean, he didn't really follow up with tests or anything.  Right.  He just left and calmed down.  He was okay.  Right.  All right.  Peter, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, Yanny?  You made that show, dude.  I used to love watching you.  You're such a doofball on that freaking show.  Did you get any money for being on that?  I can't discuss what I made.  Tell me, Yanny. 
[01:14:00]  I made a few bucks.  Yanny.  You can't be on a show like that without making bucks.  Yanny, what did you get paid, dude?  Whatever, man.  He made some money.  Whatever, Opie.  What did you care if you made money on a TV show?  Yeah, Emily.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey, good.  I was just wondering when Yanny was going to be opening up for Gallagher.  It'd be a good opening night for Gallagher. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, watermelons and balloons.  You can't go wrong.  You do any shtick?  Because I'm sure at the party, you can't just sit there making these things without talking.  What kind of rap you got?  What kind of rap do I have?  Yeah, what do you do?  Like, we're a bunch of kids.  We've just crapped ourselves, and we're high on chocolate bars, and you're making like the alligator head.  What do you tell the kids?  Make like we're just kids.  What do you do?  What do I do?  I have you all come in a circle.  Yeah.  And sing a few songs.  Oh, really?  No.  What do you do?  Like, you know, oh, and there's a mean alligator that's... 
[01:15:00]  No, I don't do that either.  Nothing?  No.  You just shut up and kids go, why isn't he talking, Lonnie?  Bob, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  What's up, Bob?  I heard you were crashing the Poconos.  I'm from there.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  What were you at?  Teasers, Anthony?  Yeah.  What else did you do?  Horseback riding and effing was pretty much the entire weekend. 
[01:15:30]  You've got to admit it.  It is a nice place to live if you had to live up there.  I don't know about that.  High white trash traffic zone there.  Come on, now.  There's no white trash up there.  Oh, yeah.  I saw so many trailers, not even good double-wides.  Just like trashy trailers, little dirty kids running around.  There's no mom.  They're not white trash.  They're Pokebillies.  Pokebillies.  Great.  Okay, thanks. 
[01:16:00]  Sounds like they could use a balloon guy up in the Poconos.  He is like the Bob Ross of balloons.  You'd be a star up there, Yany.  All right, thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's see.  He's making teeth and...  Wow.  Jesus Christ.  It's an alligator coming together.  Please, please, ladies.  Please, ladies.  Get down here for the whipped cream thing.  You're killing us.  He's making anal beads.  He's making anal beads with his balloon.  Well, to start, you've got to start somewhere.  Okay. 
[01:16:30]  We got a lot of really stupid questions for Yany.  Yeah.  Quite frankly, this is going nowhere.  Yeah, you know, we are happy to have you on, because it's cool to meet you and see what you can make.  But as far as radio...  But he makes, like, good stuff.  Yeah.  He's making some wild balloon things.  Alan, what's going on?  I've got a question for him.  Did you ever make, like, a balloon vagina, put some baby oil around it, and then give it the old heat hoe? 
[01:17:00]  That's a good question.  Yeah.  Can you make this for your toys?  If he didn't do it, I'm sure Psycho Mark would do it.  All right.  Thank you.  Yeah, he made a penis.  He made the penis.  You said you stick that in your pants open.  Right.  The one end in it.  You've got to put all these on...  Rick's got a big scary alligator hat on.  Oh, my God.  How the hell do you make that? 
[01:17:30]  That's pretty good.  I've got to give it to you.  It's pretty good.  It's wacky, but it's all right.  Get some pictures of that on the website.  He's vicious.  All right, Danny.  We're going to thank you for coming by.  You can hang.  This is what we do.  We just kind of goof off.  But I want to give the official thank you right now.  Good job.  And we'll take a break, and we'll continue the festivities, all right?  Right-o.  Stick around.  He's all confused and stuff.  212-757-1027.  Let's regroup and move on here. 
[01:18:00]  We're so stupid.  Well, if that's what it takes to get good ratings, we'll continue being stupid.  We don't care.  We don't care.  I've been expecting you to make exactly that asinine station.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Theater of the Mindless.  Lincoln Park, one step closer.  A little taste.  The Opie Show.  212-757-1027.  Steve, what's going on?  Hey, guys. 
[01:18:30]  What's up?  Hey.  This balloon guy is great.  Why don't you get a mime in there next?  Mime.  Well, you got it there.  Yeah.  Hey, um...  He just made some kind of bike or motorcycle thing.  What is that, a bike or a motorcycle?  It could be a motorcycle with a guy on it.  Yeah?  A bike with a guy on it.  All right, cool.  Are we taking pictures of this for the website, at least?  I sure hope so.  All right.  Guys, before I go, the new Carlin book is excellent.  Check it out.  Oh, yeah.  We're going to try to get Carlin on the show again.  Cool.  Thank you, bro.  Thanks.  All right.  See the J-Lo pants in the post? 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  Like, everyone's wearing the J-Lo pants now.  They're hip-huggers.  I love that style.  And the thing is, when things like this first hit the scene, who's wearing them?  The hot chicks.  The hot chicks.  They put them on, and I like them.  They're the pants that, it looks like you cut the top off of them.  Right.  And they're hip-huggers.  And then it filters down to girls from the Poconos. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Girls that shouldn't be wearing it.  This is always how this stuff happens.  Happened the same way with the spandex, the stretch pants.  You know, hot.  Followed the contours of the body.  It almost looks like she's naked.  You can imagine exactly what she looks like naked, because every bit of that material is  just hugging the skin.  Nice look.  Until the fat girls started wearing them.  And you could see every pucker, yeah, the retarded Laverne and Shirley start wearing  them.  And you see every dimpled mark, every pucker, every place she sat in the gravel driveway 
[01:20:00]  showing through on the stretch pants.  So now they're saying that the J-Lo pants, you got to watch when you sit.  The girls have to watch it.  Now, we like it.  We saw a girl wearing these things at the sushi place.  We saw a few last week coming in to get their pictures done for the whipped cream bikini  contest.  And when they sit down, if you're sitting behind them, you turn around, you look, you're seeing  a couple of good inches of ass crack.  Some quality ass crack. 
[01:20:30]  That's not plumber crack.  No, no.  It looks good.  They're sitting.  You see the small of the back going right into some ass crack.  But when the girls are walking around and they're not even sitting and you're seeing  the ass crack, you shouldn't be wearing the J-Lo pants.  They look good, though, on the girls that they got in the post.  Yeah.  Is that that band?  Who is that?  Destiny's Menudo?  Well, they change the members of Destiny's Child all the time. 
[01:21:00]  Destiny's Menudo.  Let's go to Chris.  Chris, what's going on?  Hello?  Hey, Chris.  What's up?  Hey, O&A.  Rock.  Thank God.  What's up, fellas?  Talking to you.  Oh, excellent.  Hey, I'm down here on 57th and 7th.  Yeah.  I'm doing an AP political science paper.  Basically, on you guys, I'm disguising it as a paper on obscenity and all that stuff.  Oh, that old gag.  Yeah.  So I wanted to know.  I'm down here. 
[01:21:30]  I've been down here since like 3.  I can go up there, 10 minutes, just talk to you, get some quick questions, you know,  during a break or something.  Just, you know, real quick.  What's your question?  Well, I had questions on, like, what do you, does the FCC hinder your job?  I mean, what do you think on obscenity?  What do you think, you know?  What do you think we think on obscenity?  Well, I know.  We use it all the time.  Can't you answer the questions yourself?  I mean, the FCC doesn't hinder our radio show. 
[01:22:00]  No.  You have to be smart and creative and come up with other ways to talk about sex and all  that stuff you're not allowed to say on the radio.  Hence all the code words.  Well, I just wanted to know if I'd go up there, get some names, because I need to quote  you guys for the bibliography part.  Give us a five minutes.  Please, guys.  Give us a question.  All right.  Paper.  Like, what are your feelings on the FCC in general, like how it's run?  Are they way too strict? 
[01:22:30]  Like, are they getting ridiculous?  I heard they put in new codes, new standards.  I don't even think about the FCC.  Yeah, never even.  It doesn't even cross my mind.  Not when we're doing a show.  Yeah.  No.  You've got to have some rules in place, or everyone will just be saying the F word on  the radio.  I would love that.  Because they think it would be cool.  But I mean, is the F word really that bad?  I mean, you guys have said it before.  I think it...  Children shouldn't be exposed to certain things.  Shouldn't parents be the censors? 
[01:23:00]  You don't know?  You see what I'm trying to get at?  Shouldn't parents be the censors?  Shouldn't the parents be the censors?  Yeah.  If people want to hear the F word on the radio, it's, you know...  I don't think hearing the F word is going to affect you, quite frankly.  But it being public airwaves, they have a problem with it.  So, whatever you go.  All right.  We don't need to say the F word to do a radio show.  So, it would be nice to, you know...  Be able to throw it out there once in a while.  Sure.  Just to make our point.  As a gig, you know.  Right.  What else? 
[01:23:30]  Um...  Someone's already saying, bring Balloon Guy back.  Wow, this show is going...  No, come on.  This show is really going bad.  I've been saying it for too well.  Can I maybe come up and get a wow sticker?  Yeah, you can come up and maybe some more ladies will show up to get in their whipped cream  bikinis, all right?  I'll put on a whipped cream bikini for you.  No, thank you.  All right.  All right, Chris.  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right.  I was saying, um...  Oh, this guy, Tim.  Uh, Tim, what's up?  Oh, guys, please.  Bring Balloon Guy back.  Make a muzzle for this kid.  Well, he just made some guy on a bike.  That's pretty cool.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my... 
[01:24:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, FTC, FCC, FF, FTD.  Shut this guy.  Please don't have him come on the radio.  No, we won't.  Thank you both.  All right.  Have a great day.  Thanks, Tim.  I was talking about Destiny's Child real quick.  Did you see the Nickelodeon Awards, the Kids' Choice Awards?  Oh, I missed that one.  Well, they're out there.  Yeah.  They're out there.  Shaking their asses.  They're in those little hot pants things.  In front of kids that are, like, between six and ten years old.  There you go. 
[01:24:30]  And they're in front of little kids.  Shaking it.  The worst part?  Carson Daly is up for an award.  I don't even know what it was.  It was, like, biggest douchebag on TV or something.  So, uh, they announced him as, uh, as being in this, you know, against three other guys.  And they're, like, and, uh, also Carson Daly.  You hear this sound.  This, like, high-pitched, screamy sound of, uh, ten-year-old girls screaming. 
[01:25:00]  Well, the girls love him.  He comes walking out to accept his little award.  And you can just see, he's like, how am I going to explain this to Fred Durst?  How the hell am I going to be able to hang with those guys again, looking like such a tool?  He walks up and says, little girls.  Dude, little girls are grabbing at his ankle.  To the point where he has to turn around and pull his, his leg away from this little girl hand.  See, but he loves it, or he just wouldn't show up.  But, I, I, I'm not sure.  Because he, he gets up there and he's like, thank you, this award means a lot to me. 
[01:25:30]  And you just see it in his face, like, oh, my street cred.  That he really doesn't have, but he thinks he has.  Yeah, he's not worried about that.  You don't think?  If he's coming up on an award show like that, of course not.  But then, someone goes to you, hey, go to the Nickelodeon Awards and you're going to have, you know,  a 10-year-old screaming and grabbing at your ankles.  Can't make it.  Very busy.  Very busy.  But he, I'm thinking maybe, you know, they make him do it.  You know, because it's, Nickelodeon's all owned by the same happy family as MTV. 
[01:26:00]  So if, if, uh, they tell him to go there, he's got to go.  Get some young chicks.  But they were grabbing at him and he's just like trying to pull his leg away going,  oh, oh, look what I, they make me do here.  It was embarrassing.  And, and, for the guy that, like, wants to hang with the rock bands and he gets stuck with the NSYNC.  And, yeah, he wants to hang with Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit.  And he's with NSYNC and 10-year-olds at the Nickelodeon thing.  Yeah, but you're picking, you're picking, uh, two bad examples. 
[01:26:30]  Why?  Kid Rock and Fred Durst, they're, they're cool?  No, but I'm sure.  They were their credibility, like, uh, over a year ago.  Dude, I'm sure when you want to hang out and party with a few drinks.  I don't think, I don't think it's cooler to hang out with Fred Durst and Kid Rock than it is the people from Nickelodeon.  Yeah, but, I mean, when it comes to cool, I don't think Fred Durst is up there anymore.  He has, he's never said no to anything.  Yeah, he, he's kind of ruined it.  Ruined it for himself.  Hey, Fred, we want you to hang out in, like, a whack-off booth.  It's going to make you more famous. 
[01:27:00]  Okay, I'll go.  That's a glory hole.  He'll go.  Paul, what's up?  Yeah.  Hey, what's going on?  Yeah, like, my kids, like, watch the Rugrats next scene, like, you know, there's, like, chicks and it's half-naked on, like, two-year-old twins watching the event.  Yeah.  Trying to, like, just watch, like, Little Nickelodeon.  Well, they, uh, they did that award show, and they get all these hot dancers up there, and they're half-naked.  And then you look at, they pan the crowd, and you're like, this is, this is sick.  This is disturbing.  It's like, what's next?  They worry about my kids dropping an axe at three years old. 
[01:27:30]  Nice.  Nice.  All right, Paul.  Take care.  Bye.  Bye.  Uh, John, what's going on?  Yeah, it's Vinny again, I lied.  Oh, what?  I don't know.  I get nervous.  All right.  Yeah, and, uh, well, I go to Coolmark High School, and there's no dress code.  Yeah.  So, like, since spring started, the girls have been wearing, like, those tight pants.  Yeah, the hip huggers?  Yeah, and they wear thongs and stuff, so when they're walking around, you see, like, the little string, like you guys like.  But then when you sit down, they see, like, the whole thing. 
[01:28:00]  Hold the string!  Really?  Yeah, it's awesome.  Yeah, that's the look.  The hip huggers with the thongs pulled up to the hips.  Yeah, but then, like.  Hey, uh, Vinny.  Yeah?  How many more times are you going to call today?  Yeah, I know.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  We can't wait for more calls from you.  Yeah, I'm sorry I pissed you off before.  No, you didn't piss us off.  I just can't wait for your next observation.  Okay, I'll hang up now.  All right.  Bye.  I guess Anthony was hoping those 10-year-olds were having his legs. 
[01:28:30]  Anthony's watching Nickelodeon.  Sad part is Carson Daly was effing cool as hell at KROQ in L.A.  Cool as hell?  Dan from Hoboken?  Any Carson posters up on you?  He started out in the radio biz.  Yes, he did.  All right.  Jim, what's going on?  Hey, on the Blockbuster Awards a couple weeks ago, a dog, Cameron Diaz, came on stage.  Yeah.  They put a shot of her from the back. 
[01:29:00]  She's wearing these low, like, hip-hunger pants.  And a crack for her butt is, like, sticking out.  I couldn't believe it.  I was just looking at her.  I don't think she's very hot at all.  Well, she used to be a lot hotter.  Yeah, well, she had the longer hair, like that movie she did with Jim Carrey.  Yeah.  She looked great in that movie.  Now, I don't know what happened to her.  She hit the wall at an early age, I guess.  That mouth is stretching.  Oh, she leaves lines in her face.  I don't even think she's 30 yet.  Look at us being picky, like you would turn her down.  Well.  You know, even at her peak, if she was just a chick walking down the street, you wouldn't  give her a second look? 
[01:29:30]  No, but her job is to be gorgeous.  No way.  She's on TV, and she's supposed to be some hot supermodel.  You walk down the street, you see, like, hotter chicks just walking in Manhattan on  a warm day.  You get whiplash.  If you saw her walking by, all right, you'd give her a second look, but nothing any more  than a lot of the chicks that are out there on night's day.  I think she was beautiful.  But now?  And there's something about Mary.  She was unbelievable.  You see that walking down the street, you're not looking?  You look, but nothing any more than you would give a lot of the chicks you see out there 
[01:30:00]  on a summer day.  The wall did a lot of damage to her.  You guys did a lot of damage.  I think we're being oversensitive.  I think she's still a piece of ass, and none of us would turn her down.  Well, we didn't say that.  All right.  All right.  Take care, guys.  Bye.  No.  Big win for the Knicks.  Marcus Camby's a...  What is he?  Did he get hurt?  No, man.  Then what's the problem?  Family crisis.  It's over.  It's not over. 
[01:30:30]  Get back to work.  His sister was, like, sexually assaulted.  Wasn't like it was him.  You've got to be kidding.  What?  Get to work.  Marcus Tink.  Marcus Tink.  What?  What exactly happened?  Are you kidding?  I really don't know what happened.  I've been in the Poconos.  Well, all I know is a intruder came in the house.  I remember that.  That's happened before the Poconos.  Right.  But I didn't hear of what happened.  It was a really big deal. 
[01:31:00]  I heard he wanted to see Marcus.  And his sister was basically raped.  No.  Yeah.  Sexually assaulted.  Stop.  I think it's pretty tough to continue doing your job if something happens to your family.  All right.  I'll take that right back.  Who knew that happened?  She was a whore.  Stop it.  They were held hostage.  And stop it.  The sister assaulted.  Assaulted.  Sexually assaulted.  Like digits or the full deal?  I don't know. 
[01:31:30]  That makes a difference?  Well, sort of.  You could put it in a category of horror.  But I didn't know that happened.  I just thought he wanted to see Marcus, help the family at night point, and that was it.  And you could just move on from that?  Well, he's got a game to play.  He's got a team.  No I in team.  But now this comes.  Okay.  Now I see it's a little maddy.  And what was the guy's reasoning? 
[01:32:00]  He just wanted to meet Marcus?  That's got to be a little guilt.  Okay.  No, they knew him and stuff, right Rick?  Yeah, he knew him.  Yeah.  Oh, what?  Family friend?  I guess they used to date and she broke up with him.  Yeah, old boyfriend and all that.  Well, then it's not that bad.  It's not that bad.  Because she's already had.  It's still forced sex, dude.  Yeah, but it's not like it's foreign stuff.  What?  I thought we were all having fun.  Sweet, merciful crap. 
[01:32:30]  It was a big win without Canby in the lineup.  Oh, right.  Right.  And hopefully Canby will be back soon, Anthony.  Yes.  Godspeed.  Best wishes.  Ah, Jimmy, what's going on?  Yeah.  Hey.  Oh, and I?  Yeah, what's going on?  I said, Jimmy, listen.  The one that was hijacking, it was the ex-boyfriend.  I know.  We just said that.  It's not a big deal.  Okay.  See, I got somebody that agreed.  You know, it's just kind of, you know, over-quaintances type thing. 
[01:33:00]  It's bad.  Well, I wouldn't, you know, like it much.  But you know what?  I don't make three million a year.  So you think Canby should have played?  Same.  It's been a while.  How long?  Not even a week.  Four days.  Four days?  Five days?  Thank you, Jimmy.  You sick F.  If I could have been, I'd have been back on the gridiron right after Nicole's death.  So I think he's a pussy.  A pussy. 
[01:33:30]  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Matt, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  You guys were talking about young girls before.  I'm a high school teacher.  That's all I can do not to walk around the school with a boner.  Oh, man.  Right?  At risk of sounding like a pedophile.  Well, I mean, the girls are so smoking nowadays.  At risk?  I don't know what it is.  I don't know if it's in the dairy or what.  Something in the water, right?  It's red and hot.  I'm a special ed teacher, no doubt.  No less.  A lot of these girls don't even realize how hot they are. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, yes, they do.  The littler ones?  They're asking for it, Opie.  16, 17, 18.  You'll have fun in the sun, in the Poconos.  He's a teacher.  Jesus.  Tony, what's going on?  Hey, how's it going?  All right.  All right.  Hey, last night, did you take notice that Jackass and their new show?  They went into this thing with Johnny Knoxville, interviewing with that guy from MTV News. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, MTV's starting to crack.  Yeah, man.  You watch.  It doesn't look good.  It doesn't look good.  You know, I didn't see it, but Stinky did.  I guess get Stinky in here.  They did, like, a 10-minute interview with Johnny Knoxville instead of showing us some  cool jackass pranks, right, Stink?  Right.  They're panicking over at MTV.  Cut it out and just continue running the show as is.  And then they took the reruns.  They took the reruns and they tried to make, like, I don't know, 15 minutes of the show  and it blew.  Yeah, what happened, Stink?  The first 10 minutes was an interview with Chris Conley.  And the whole time you're thinking, all right, the guy's going to come and hit him with 
[01:35:00]  a chair when he's doing it because they're so serious.  He's like, we never watched the tapes.  We don't want anyone to do that.  And it goes on and on.  And you're just thinking, where's the joke?  And then it never ends.  And then 10 minutes later.  No, they'll buckle.  Yeah, they stopped and they continued with the rest of the episode of Jackass, but it  was a repeat.  Jackass will be off the air in another month.  Yeah.  They're going to completely crack.  One more kid.  It'll take one more kid.  Yeah, blue lit.  All right.  All right, take care now. 
[01:35:30]  I can't believe Johnny Knoxville would agree to a sit-down interview, a serious sit-down interview.  He looked pissed, though, like he didn't want to say it.  Yeah, they made him do it.  Of course.  It's like Carson, Nickelodeon.  They're like, look, we're getting a lot of heat.  We're going to have to sit down and try to work this out so more kids don't try your stunts.  They're going to continue trying your stunts.  One more kid does it.  It's over.  It's over, Johnny.  Remember, they made Beavis stop saying, fire, fire.  Yeah.  Matt, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, O&A?  Hey.  I got something to say about Canby.  In the paper, it says how he got all loaded. 
[01:36:00]  He's so rich, and he moved his mother away from the project.  Right.  Fifteen minutes away.  How far you got to go?  You know, he's got all this money.  He was mother fifteen minutes away from the project.  What do you think's going to happen out there?  I don't know.  I saw the footage on TV.  That looks like a damn good neighborhood.  Yeah.  Now he's about fifteen minutes away.  He's all over the bridge.  Probably have family and friends they want to stay close to.  Yeah, you can get that BMW right over that bridge.  Keeping it real.  Yeah, right.  All right, man.  All right, later.  Give it back.  Bye.  Got to give some back is what they do, Opie. 
[01:36:30]  You give some back when you make it.  Brian, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  The other day, I'm working in the supermarket now.  So while I'm sitting there, and this lady bends over to pick up a can of corn or whatever.  Right.  And she's wearing those nice white stretch pants, right?  Mm-hmm.  So while I look over, and Nasty Pete goes, 40-year-old Pete.  Oh, what?  No, guys.  I'm fifteen. 
[01:37:00]  I got a question for you.  What's up?  What's up with your voice?  I got a question for you.  Man, I got a question for you.  Puberty sucks, huh?  What?  Puberty sucks, huh, Brian?  When did your voice start changing?  I don't know.  Around thirteen?  No, it's still changing.  It's all over the place.  Cracking like crazy.  Well, I just got over a cold, too.  But anyways, guys, I've got a question for you.  Yeah.  Now, I'm fifteen.  I've been with a couple of girls.  But, yo, is it supposed to smile at you when it's sideways? 
[01:37:30]  Smile?  Yeah.  I don't think so.  Not a smile.  I don't know, guys.  That's all I wanted to say, all right?  All right, Brian.  Thank you.  All right.  No problem.  All right.  No problem.  All right.  Hey, Frank Caliendo playing, what, Caroline's this weekend?  Yeah.  This weekend, the guy that does all the great voices.  He's been on our show a few times.  Here's a little taste of what you might see at Caroline's, and we'll be back.  I did, like, a whole cast of Seinfeld in, like, an anti-drug episode. 
[01:38:00]  If they never did stuff like that, that would have been funnier, like, tonight on a very  special Seinfeld, Jerry's been doing drugs.  Why do my fingers look like little people?  Who are these people?  What are they doing to talk to each other?  They're talking about me.  What are they saying?  George, don't mean George.  I got no idea, Jerry.  No idea.  Somebody help me.  Hey, Jerry, you look like you've been seeing little people on your fingers.  All this comedy all these years, we thought you're making this stuff up.  Well, I guess you just let the cap...  Right out of the back. 
[01:38:30]  You can't tell.  Oh, I can tell.  It's written all over your face.  I wrote it on my face.  Well, maybe that was the little people on your fingers.  Who's going to tell this to me?  Newman.  Hello, Jerry.  Hello, Newman.  I came over all since I had a Jerry Garcia, a grateful dad come up with his stabs.  You can see them.  Have you seen them?  I licked them.  Come see little people on my fingers.  You ruined my life.  You ruined everybody's life.  In fact, you're the guy who dropped that thing and ruined Jurassic Park.  And you guys got it.  The first radio station ever to get my bitch. 
[01:39:00]  I'm gone.  That's right.  That was Newman.  Bravo, man.  Newman screwed the whole damn thing up.  You and Buck again.  He's driving that chief in the mind.  Yeah.  There's nothing better than a good Newman.  I love it.  Yeah.  Cruze.  I got to take a dump.  Tomo.  Tomo with a castle age.  Marone.  Console radio. 
[01:39:30]  Morning.  Oh, you got that degeneral gather around waiting to say booze.  Oh, God.  What's my tongue?  O.B.  It's almost not fair to people to put this garbage in front of them.  It's the ONA show, 212-757-1027.  Janie's in the studio for boot camp making balloon stuff. 
[01:40:00]  Can't call it balloon animals.  He's got a guy on a motorcycle.  He's making all sorts of weird crap.  Alligator.  The head and the mermaid.  And the mermaid.  And a bumblebee.  A bumblebee, yeah.  We're in radio hell today.  That happened.  And on top of that, we've only had one lady come down today for the whipped cream bikini contest. 
[01:40:30]  Monday, usually a slow day for the whipped cream bikini girls, unfortunately.  One lady, her pictures are up on WNAW.com.  Don't get confused, ladies.  You can still qualify for that trip to Hawaii.  Grand prize, of course.  Just get your ass down here sometime this week while we're on the air and show off what you've got.  WNAW whipped cream bikini contest is brought to you by whipped cream bikini.com.  Trip courtesy of Contiki Tours and Victory Limousine. 
[01:41:00]  We've got a lot of girls so far, huh?  What are we up to?  Like 16?  And I think there's a contender or two in there.  Well, we were counting before the show today.  There's six finalists up there right now.  You're seeing six at least.  Out of the 16.  Also, in about an hour, we're going to have another chance for you to win a trip to L.A.  to see the final episode of Survivor 2 when they do that whole town hall meeting, the two-hour grand finale.  When they announce the winner.  And when they have the studio audience or Bryant Gumbel and all that, you'll be in the audience. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  All you had to do was be watching CBS this morning in the 6 a.m. hour.  Bryant and I were on TV, and we did a quick, like, 10-second video clip, and we'll ask you a question about the clip, and then you'll qualify for the trip to L.A.  What the hell was that clip this morning?  I don't know.  We gave them some good stuff, and they picked a weird one today.  What the hell was that?  Like, the past two have been okay.  The past two have been pretty good.  Yeah.  But this one was like, what?  All right, well, see what happens.  We'll do that around 6.30 if people are tuning in for that, okay? 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  Paul the Pilot, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right, man.  Were you up in the sky the other day?  Uh, no, actually, I'm planning this next Wednesday.  All right, because somebody was trying to do something.  No, it wasn't me.  Yeah, a lot of people called and said, I think Paul's at it, because it looked like either a wow or a girl with really big, ugly boobs in the sky.  Yeah.  No, it wasn't me.  I had a work Wednesday.  Yeah.  But I got this next Wednesday off the weather's good. 
[01:42:30]  I'll probably be doing that.  Okay.  But I called.  You guys want me to come down and see if you guys had a sign?  And why?  You know, like for the death.  Huh?  Radio.  Oh, all right.  All like we should sign.  Yeah, we're getting abused for having you on the show today.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's got to do with the balloon guy.  The balloon guy.  Well, no, we figured we were interviewing him about the show, and while he was being interviewed, he made some stuff for us.  That's all.  No big deal. 
[01:43:00]  Pretty poor.  All right.  Thank you, Paul.  All right, guys.  Thanks for the support.  If your writing's not up to par in the sky, I'm going to call you out on it.  Not a problem.  If you think you can do better.  All right, Paul.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  I'll see you.  I think Paul's taking a shot at us today.  Yeah.  Alan, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Good.  That contestant number 16 in the whipped cream bikini contest?  I believe that would be Kelly.  Oh, my God.  Is she amazing?  You know what?  I should have seen that live.  She's spectacular. 
[01:43:30]  Is she a dancer?  I don't think so.  She's from Connecticut, right?  I mean, I've looked over those.  There's some chick.  I've looked over those pictures.  There are no flaws on that woman.  You know what?  The digital camera didn't do her justice.  She's even hotter than those pictures.  Unbelievable.  Can Yany make me a balloon figure of her?  Yeah.  Yeah, good luck.  All right, guys.  Yany, did you see her?  Show Yany that picture.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I'm looking at that right now.  Look at that.  Maybe that's why I know ladies are coming down today.  I feed all over myself.  Ladies, you don't think you can...  I'll tell you, some of these are really great spanking pitchers. 
[01:44:00]  They really are.  Maybe the ladies don't think they can beat out Kelly and they're going to stay away.  Well, no, no.  Ladies, you don't know what the voting brings.  We've been surprised with every contest we've had like this.  Sal, what's going on?  I want to know when we get to vote.  We're going to qualify all this week and then I guess next week we'll finally start voting.  Okay.  Because a lot of girls called last week and said, look, I can't make it, but I can make it next week.  Can you guys extend it? 
[01:44:30]  We said, sure.  Why not?  Right.  But the best move was like, you know, you can vote like almost every day.  No, that's what's going to happen with this contest.  We're still qualifying.  That's all.  Just keep listening to the show.  We'll let you know what's going down.  No problem.  We figure we get a few more ladies down here to qualify.  Yeah, the more to marry it.  Yeah.  I'm having a good time.  All right, cool.  I'm having a good time looking.  All right, Sal.  Thank you.  Thanks.  Bye.  I've got to look at my stuff.  Oof.  What?  Nothing.  Nothing.  Oh, you saw a...  Sucker Patty.  No, that's a given. 
[01:45:00]  That's a given.  Oof.  Like, I don't even go to that anymore.  This one was a little much right there.  Yeah.  It was a little much.  Yeah.  Well, I don't think that's a finalist.  Why?  No, there's plenty of finalists, though.  I wouldn't worry about it.  All right.  Let's go to Ed.  Ed, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you been?  Good.  Hey, listen.  Are you guys starting to put that on us here or something?  Why?  Why?  It seems like ever since that Sarah Jessica Parker incident, you guys are playing good cop, 
[01:45:30]  bad cop.  With what?  You pick one chick like Carmen Diaz.  One guy goes, oh, yeah, she's so hot.  And the other guy's going like, man, I wouldn't do her.  I mean.  Like, we're covering all the bases.  What do you think?  All these chicks are listening to you now?  She's hot.  What are you going to say?  Oh, you think she's hot?  Let's get the other opinion now.  Well, Ed doesn't think she's that great.  Yeah.  She's all right.  No big deal, really.  I mean, you know.  It's not like she's listening to the show. 
[01:46:00]  Hey, listen.  I'm surprised Buzz.  He hasn't called in yet.  Sarah Jessica Parker.  Yeah.  She wimped out on us, by the way.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  She was supposed to come down.  She said, well, let's see what you look like.  Come down to the set, and I'll take a look at you guys, and I'll tell you what's up.  Did you guys ever make it down to the set?  She never called back.  We said, sure, we'll go down any day you want.  I don't care.  Oh.  I don't care what you would say to me and to my face, and they pretty much blew us off.  So, hey, listen.  If guys pussy out, what do girls do? 
[01:46:30]  Oh, you think about that.  Yeah, okay.  All right.  Bye.  Thank you.  Let's go to Jay.  Who's next on N.E.W.  Jay, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  I agree with you.  Pennsylvania is a pit, man.  There you go.  I used to live out there.  Then I moved back to Jersey.  Yaney.  Yes.  This is Duckworth, dude.  Jay Duckworth.  How's it going?  What's up?  Dude, you've got to be crazy, man.  I know you're a nutball.  You've got to get on the mic with these guys.  You've got the job.  Relax a little bit. 
[01:47:00]  Have fun.  He was talking earlier, and then he got preoccupied with his balloon stuff.  Dude, these are dirty balloons.  Remember the balloon you made for me?  Yeah, I know.  From the prop shop?  We got it lurking around here somewhere.  He's making various genitalia and peeing dog balloons.  Oh, Jesus.  Hey, I've got to ask you, Yaney.  I didn't have a chance.  Sorry about this, guys.  Yeah, go.  Who was the fag?  Who was the fag?  No, on the show.  I mean, there's a survivor show.  One of the girls was a lesbian.  Yeah, Brown was a lesbian. 
[01:47:30]  Brown was a lesbian.  She had to admit it to everyone for some reason.  Why?  Even though it didn't even come into play at all.  I know.  She was the only one who admitted it to gay.  I guess it's become hip to just say you're gay on, like, national TV shows now.  Yeah.  That's craziness, man.  Crazy.  That's madness.  All right, Jay.  All right, cool, man.  You guys rock, man.  We'll see you guys later.  All right, man.  There you go, Jay.  Hey, Sean, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  I've got two things.  Number one, when are we going to interview a mind?  And number two, I'm having a paper inside. 
[01:48:00]  It's like, flip off the SEC.  What the hell is with this kid?  What?  Wow.  Holy Jesus.  What?  All right, first of all, when are you going to interview a mind?  I thought I told you to shut up.  Just for you, we're going to do it tomorrow.  What the hell, Sean?  I appreciate it.  And what else?  And what's with this kid with the test?  If I had the SEC, it says that's you to mark the test.  Oh, my God.  I think he's outside talking to Earl or something.  All right, man. 
[01:48:30]  Thanks.  Bye.  Let's go to Tony.  Tony, what's up?  Tony.  Oh, my God.  Hello?  Hello?  All right.  Eric, what's going on?  What's going on, ONA?  Hey, man.  I got a real quick comment on that chick who's trying to sue Jackass for her son getting hit by the car.  Yeah, well, first of all, that's not even based on a Jackass stunt.  I know.  I watch it every week.  The kid trying to jump over the car, that's from a TV commercial for a sneaker. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  It had nothing to do with Jackass, first of all.  No.  And then the sneaker company, they cracked under the pressure and they pulled their ad and changed the spot or whatever.  Oh, really?  I thought it had to do with Jackass.  It had nothing to do with Jackass.  Either way, I think the kid's got some mental problems trying to jump over a moving car to begin with.  Oh, yeah.  Real quick, when's Brian Regan going to be in town again?  It's going to be a while now.  Yeah, he was just here.  Yeah, I know.  I wanted to go, but I missed him. 
[01:49:30]  He only comes around like twice a year.  Really?  He won't be back until the fall, probably.  I would suck.  He's a very, very famous comedian these days.  He's freaking hilarious.  I wanted to call and get him to do his bit with the science fair.  Yeah.  Well, you should pick up a CD.  All that stuff's on a CD.  Oh, he does have a CD out.  Yeah, one of the best comedy CDs that I've listened to in the last few years.  Really?  Cool.  I'll just go pick up that.  Without a doubt.  It's tough to find.  Man, I think you can get it off Amazon.com.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cool deal.  All right, guys. 
[01:50:00]  All right, man.  See you later.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Someone says, look at contestant number 30.  I said the number.  I wasn't going to do that.  It says, look at a certain contestant and cover her face with your hand.  Tell me that looks like a woman.  That was the one we were just looking at.  Oh, yeah.  Poor girl.  It's a man.  Thank you.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Like an average wrestler. 
[01:50:30]  All the girls.  Lovely.  Right.  Very lovely.  Yes.  Kevin, what's going on?  Yeah, what's up?  I work here in the city, and I worked on the Reebok commercial.  Yeah.  I'm on it.  Yeah, go.  Yeah, it was done on green screen.  The kid didn't even jump the car.  Well, that's pretty obvious.  I...  Holy ass.  Okay.  This is going to be...  I bet you it's going to be a full moon tonight. 
[01:51:00]  Something is weird today.  Really weird today.  Do we have an emergency break glass thing around here or something?  Johnny.  Or Yanny.  It's Yanny.  No, we don't need another effing balloon animal.  That's not going to help the show today, okay?  No.  Oh, Jesus.  Of course it was done on green...  Whatever.  Green screen or whatever you call it these days.  Oh, my God.  I'm waiting for someone to call up and say,  and the guy that headbutts the ram, that was real. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  Guy just had a really thick skull.  What a mess.  Greg, what's going on?  Hey, Greg.  What's up, buddy?  I had to ask you guys, what was the idea of Sucker Patty being on there?  Isn't she like a 40-year-old version or something, but she can go and do that?  I don't know what's going on with Sucker Patty.  She's losing her effing mind.  Yeah, she wants to be on, so who are we to say no? 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, I suppose you guys are right.  Let me tell you something about Sucker Patty's pictures.  They're not the worst pictures.  I don't know, man.  Wow.  It scared me when it turned on.  Wow, that's going out on a limb.  Okay, that's going out on a limb.  Are you looking at the same pictures as me?  Yeah.  I'm not saying Sucker Patty's hot, but there are girls that are uglier than Sucker Patty on that site.  Worse than Sucker Patty on the site.  Mendy, hello.  Oh, okay. 
[01:52:30]  Are you saying you would rather do Mendy or Sucker Patty before Mendy?  That's not what I'm saying.  I'm saying there's worse pictures than Sucker Patty's pictures.  I wouldn't do either one of them.  That's a stupid question.  But if you had to choose.  I would kill myself.  Okay.  I'm not falling for that gag.  There's not a chance in the world I would do either one of them.  No?  You have to or else you're dead.  Anything?  Oh, well.  You'd just die.  Gone. 
[01:53:00]  Joe, what's up?  Hey, Joe.  Oh, my God.  There's a guy.  It's Opie and Anthony's Whipped Cream Bikini Contest.  Ladies, come down to WNEW anytime between 3 and 7 for your chance to win the grand prize trip to Hawaii.  It's your body covered in our cream.  Opie and Anthony's Whipped Cream Bikini Contest.  1027.  WNEW.  Ah, Mendy, what's up?  Hi, guys.  How are you?  I just heard you talking about me. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  What?  You wouldn't do me, Opie?  Mendy, no offense, but, I mean, your body's a mess.  Not into the fatties.  And let me preface this by saying I understand there's a lot of guys that really find you attractive and the big butt attractive.  Chubby chaser.  And they're into that.  And you've got to, you know, and I'll give you a compliment.  You have a very nice face.  I think so.  But, I mean, your body is a mess.  It looks like a midget trying to, like, you know, bang his way out.  Well, I tell you what. 
[01:54:00]  I make this challenge to you.  You get me into the, you know, into the finals there, and we will see whether myself, as a fatty here, as a big girl, with a nice big butt,  could win and get more votes than one of the more slender, supposedly more beautiful women.  But, see, this is what's going to happen.  We put you in the finals.  Of course, everyone's going to vote for you.  Now, is it goof?  There's a goof thing going on.  No, I think people would be honest and vote for me if they liked me. 
[01:54:30]  This is what's going to happen.  We've got a panel of guys that work for WNW, okay?  And they decide who the finalists are, not just Ant and I.  We both get a vote, and there's at least, I don't know, 10 to 12, maybe 15 guys  that will help us decide who the finalists are.  Okay.  And if you make it to the finals, then great.  But we're not going to rig it now and put you in the finals.  Well, I think that, you know, I mean, why don't you give everyone a chance  and let people vote on all of the girls who are there and let the crowd decide. 
[01:55:00]  No, because we've got to narrow it down to, like, you know, 10 or 12 girls, you know?  I think we have a good cross-section of guys' tastes that go over and pick the finalists.  You don't have, you don't have, you don't have, you know?  But, here's the thing.  When you guys had the best breast contest.  Your breasts are horrendous.  Okay, so my breasts are kind of saggy.  I agree with that.  You know, I feel like we should get you some breast implants.  That would help that body.  Kind of saggy.  Mendy, they're flat. 
[01:55:30]  The A-bomb did a little damage.  Mendy, you've done a lot for our show and stuff, but your nips point right down to the ground.  Well, okay, so I have torpedoes, mmm, you know.  They're not torpedoes.  Torpedoes are full.  I'll censor myself there.  They're not even torpedoes.  But, okay.  I don't know what the hell's going on.  Okay, but you have to, you have to give me.  Wait, how does a big girl like yourself get flat, saggy boobs?  Don't they usually, you know, fill up and get nice and a little firmer? 
[01:56:00]  Well, you know, I don't know.  I actually used to have, like, a full B, small C before I had kids.  Right.  And then now, now.  Did you eat them?  Actually, now I have 40 double Ds, you know, and they're all natural women.  They're 40 long.  Oh, that's cold.  Because they're all natural, Opie.  Like, we've mistaken them for implants.  Mendy.  Mendy.  Eggplants, maybe.  You make a lot of money off your big butt.  And I know there's a lot of guys that find you attractive.  I just don't see it myself. 
[01:56:30]  Okay, but there are many, many men out there.  You were on your back for the whipped cream bikini contest.  It looked like you were eight months pregnant.  I'll give you that.  You know what?  I'm 5'9", 21, and 35 pounds.  I'm a big girl.  And you know what?  I don't have a problem with the fact that I am big.  You know, a lot of people, in fact, on the Opie Anthony message board right now  are having a fight about whether they should stand up for me or put me down or whatever. 
[01:57:00]  And you know what?  Mendy, it's not my intention to put you down.  I just don't get it myself.  I gave you the compliment.  You've got a very, very nice face.  But I don't understand the guys that are into, like, the chubby chaser thing.  You know, there's someone for everyone.  You know your career would be over if you went on a diet because then you would lose the big butt, right?  Okay, but then you guys get me the implants and then I go in jugs.  In jugs, there you go.  You know what?  You are a specialty chick. 
[01:57:30]  You are.  Oh, absolutely.  This contest, or pretty much like the finalists that make it through,  are going to be generally, very generally accepted women that are, that a lot of people will...  Societal acceptance.  Right.  Societal acceptance.  Your specialty.  Your chubby chaser's delight.  Absolutely.  And you know what?  I completely agree with that.  But...  I'm talking about Patty's not fat, but you think she's going to make the finalists?  Mendy, you, like, mail out your underwear and stuff to guys because they're so into you, right? 
[01:58:00]  And ASAP as stinky as possible.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  How much do you get for your used underwear?  $30 a pair.  Do they make soup with it or what?  Oh!  You know, I don't ask the questions.  I just make the money.  All right, Mendy, you know...  All right, listen.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  What do you do to dirty up the panties so the guy gets his money's worth for his $30?  I just wear them. 
[01:58:30]  Do you do jumping jacks?  I mean, do you run around the block, get all sweaty?  What do you do?  I actually, I, you know, I have had certain requests to, you know, to have me do things,  you know, such as, you know, do the exercise in the panties so that it's a nice, you know, aromatic.  And, you know, I do what I do for the money.  Of course, there's more money in more aroma.  All right, Mendy, I'm going to have an open mind here, okay? 
[01:59:00]  Okay, this is what I, this is what I need you to do, okay?  Do it.  And it's going to make a lot of people puke.  Send, send, send a pair of panties to the radio show.  Oh, my God.  All right?  And I'll have an open mind.  And I'll try to, I'll try to understand what the guys are, you know, seeing or, or smelling  with this crap.  You're going to, you're going to smell it?  You're personally going to smell it?  You're going to smell it.  You're going to have a consent.  No.  No, you will not.  You're not a dog, I will.  Let's put it, why not, why not challenge it this way? 
[01:59:30]  Get one of your skinny chicks that are out there, that are supposedly hot looking.  All right, Mendy.  Supposedly hot.  And have them send in a pair of panties as well.  Because I know that has nothing to do with weight.  I understand.  I went out with a, a, a really hot girl in college, small, nice body, that's, uh, uh, I happen  to have very good hygiene.  And she was not fat. 
[02:00:00]  All right, so.  I, that's one thing, I do take care of myself, I, I don't like.  All right, but this is the problem.  Just knowing that it came from you, the visual's going to be happening in my head, I'm going  to have a tough time, but I, but I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll play it out.  Okay.  So send them in.  You know what?  I will, I will do that.  Smell like a dumpster at a Chinese restaurant.  Oh, you guys are so bad.  You guys are so bad.  Mendy, you got to understand something.  You have to know that your body type is not the type that is, is hot to most guys. 
[02:00:30]  No, I understand that.  But you're kind of making it sound like, hey, you know, you get one of these skinny  chicks that, like those, those are the hot ones to most guys.  Hey, I've seen, you know, and it has nothing to do with your, I've seen some horrific skinny  girls too, so.  Right.  Right, right.  All right, is anyone.  Guys, guys, hold on one second.  I'm a pro wrestler on the other one, though.  I got to talk.  A pro wrestler, who?  Two seconds.  Who?  Two seconds.  Who?  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  All right, we'll play this while we wait.  Who is the girl as white as a highway? 
[02:01:00]  Fast from her belly, head to her knee.  It's like a truck when she's walking backwards.  Everyone knows it's Wendy.  Who's got the kid who's up in the city?  Her track is full of fun on his feet. 
[02:01:30]  Who is a fifty-five gallon drink that everyone knows it's Wendy.  And Wendy's got thunder size.  Her fancy dog is both size.  And Wendy's got the five feet wide.  And the track flies.  And the track flies. 
[02:02:00]  He's got the spark that felt like a problem.  Watch out for Annie, flying there, please.  She's got the spark, but she's called them much, but everyone knows it's Wendy.  She's got the spark that's good, but she's got the spark that she needs. 
[02:02:30]  Well, you're the power, you're the power, but everyone knows it's Wendy.  Mindy, are you still there?  Yeah, I'm here now.  Hi there.  I had a little music interlude there.  What kind of wrestler were you on the phone with?  I'm actually standing right next to him right now.  He's the Godfather.  What are you doing with the Godfather?  I'm getting ready to go out on a date.  Get out of here.  I'm dead serious.  He's right here. 
[02:03:00]  And he's now representing Bret Hart and the whole bit.  And, you know, he's standing right here.  You want to say hello?  Wait, wait, the Godfather's still with the WWF, though.  Hold on one second.  Here he is.  All right.  It's okay.  Hello.  Hello.  Godfather.  How are you doing?  Are you the Godfather from the WWF?  Well, I'm the person that sold the WWF the Godfather name.  I'm the original Godfather.  Oh.  Oh.  What's going on?  The guy in the suit. 
[02:03:30]  Exactly.  You go around telling everyone that you're the original Godfather?  Where nowadays?  Where were you the original Godfather?  I worked for the WWF from, like, 91 to 93.  91 to 93.  Yeah, we're representing Bret Hart now.  We have our own company in New York.  We just did shows this weekend.  Bret just left town, so.  What's Bret doing these days?  Well, actually, he's just doing personal appearances.  He still has post-concussion syndrome, so he's not doing that much with the wrestling.  He just came into town for five personal appearances.  How could you go around as the Godfather knowing that the Godfather is out there, and that's the one everyone knows? 
[02:04:00]  That's not absolutely true.  Not in New York.  No, that's absolutely true, dude.  Come on.  You've got to know it.  We thought we were talking to the Godfather.  Yeah.  The guy that was pimping hoes 24-7.  I have to pull those inside this.  All right.  Are you going to bang Mendy tonight?  I'm going to try.  Yeah?  You into the chubbies, huh?  I'm into everything.  You like the big girl like that, though? 
[02:04:30]  Excuse me?  You like a big girl like that?  There's nothing wrong with that.  That ass.  Exactly.  What are you doing when you're not telling people you're the original Godfather?  That's all I do full-time.  Wow.  All right.  Are you a black guy?  No, I'm not.  What?  You're not even a black guy.  I'm Italian.  I'm more Italian than you are.  Come on.  The Godfather is a black guy.  It's not believable when a white guy is pushing hoes.  Why is that?  Because the wrestling stuff is based on stereotypes and stuff. 
[02:05:00]  Right.  What was your gimmick when you were the Godfather?  Basically, it was an Italian hitman.  He used to come out with the fedora that had the cigar, the rings, the whole nine yards.  Oh, you went that route.  How many people are disappointed when they think they're seeing the Godfather and there's an Italian white guy standing in front of them?  That's not true.  I always thought it was a little weird that the Godfather was a black guy.  Well, if you remember when the Godfather first thought, he tried to come out as an Italian.  Even though he was black, he was trying to come out as an Italian with the fedora and everything else. 
[02:05:30]  It didn't work out, so they turned him into the Godfather hole, which was a great gimmick.  So how much did you get for selling the Godfather character?  Oh, there you go.  Enough to keep me going.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  For like seven figures?  Very close.  I'm finally going to admit that this show really blows today.  We got the original Godfather.  We can't even get, like, the Godfather on the show.  It would be great to have the original Godfather versus the Godfather.  That would be interesting, right?  For you. 
[02:06:00]  He hasn't accepted our challenge.  We've been trying.  All right.  Well, good luck with Mendy.  Appreciate it.  I'm going to put her back on.  Hold on one sec.  Hey, where are you guys right now?  Where are we right now?  Somewhere in Jersey.  Where are we?  In a car.  Hello?  Hello?  Mendy, could he go down for, like, a sniff?  Oh, and then we could ask him.  Not this week.  Oh, God.  Make sure.  Make sure.  Oh, you're going to sting.  Oh, you're going to sting. 
[02:06:30]  Make sure you send the panties when that goes away, please.  I wasn't going to do that this week.  Because it looks like the garage after the St. Valentine's Day massacre.  But, see, I mean.  Hey, someone's on the line that says they bought Mendy's panties because he needed cheap car covers.  Oh, that's cold.  That's so cold.  Oh, God.  Have me do it anyway.  Look at it this way, guys.  It's, you know, it's not every day that you get a, you know, pro wrestler to kick out on a date. 
[02:07:00]  Pro wrestler?  Pro wrestler?  Not a pro wrestler.  Yes, he is.  He probably does crack the pony antlers.  Raise the arm.  You guys are so bad.  I'm sure up in the bank.  And, you know, I mean, it just gives to show that fat chicks can get just as many guys as skinny chicks.  But he's nobody.  I, let's put it this way, guys.  There is something to be said for the art of the tease.  And whether you are a skinny chick or a fat chick, as long as you know how to tease and how to torment a man's body, 
[02:07:30]  You can get, you can get, yours is so bad, you can get whatever you want.  All right, Mendy.  Well, good luck with the contest.  You might make the finals.  You never know.  Exactly.  And send in your panties and we'll take a little gander at them.  Well, how about I bring them down one day and I take them right off of my body.  You know why?  All right.  Because you'll run over here and try to shove it in someone's face. 
[02:08:00]  No.  No, I won't.  No, I will.  We'll set up some guidelines.  We'll set up some guidelines because we've got to make sure it comes off your body.  That's fine.  Okay.  We can do that.  I'm down with that.  And, you know, I mean, I mean, it depends on, you know.  Oh, God, I'm getting nauseous.  Why am I doing that?  Yeah.  It's a picnic.  It just hit me.  Yeah, but, guys, I look at it different, you know.  I mean, being in this contest, I do it for fun.  You know, people want to tool on me.  You know what?  They're going to tool on me.  All right. 
[02:08:30]  They're going to tool on skinny chicks.  They're going to tool on me as a fat chick.  And you know what?  I don't care.  That's fine.  Listen, listen, listen.  I just gave us come up with the next contest after we're done with the whipped cream bikini  contest.  All right.  A BBW contest.  Okay.  We'll only have big women.  Big butt women?  Is that what BBW is?  Big beautiful women.  Oh, big beautiful women?  Okay.  Big butt women.  Whatever.  Big butt, big beautiful, big breasts, whatever you want to call it.  Uh-huh.  We'll have a BBW contest.  Okay. 
[02:09:00]  And, you know, you're going to find that there are a lot of big, beautiful women out  there that are absolutely sexy beyond belief.  I see your lives coming.  And it doesn't matter what size a person is.  It really doesn't matter.  You can be sexy at any size.  All right.  There's so many women that are over a size 14, which is considered, I guess, the beginning  of, you know, BBW.  All right.  As a goof, we'll do that for you, okay?  As a goof.  Oh, you guys are so bad.  Well, at least I'm honest, Mendy. 
[02:09:30]  We're going to bust in the cat chicks from the Poconos.  I think you have a nice personality.  I think you have a nice face.  But I don't get the body thing.  Mendy, you're confusing this with guys like, you're confusing guys that love big women as  hot girls for guys that really just want to get laid, I think.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Right?  Let's be honest here.  Right?  Do you like big women or do you just want to get laid?  Both. 
[02:10:00]  Both.  Both.  Both.  Both.  Both.  See?  Well, of course he's going to tell you.  It's like if a fat girl goes into a bar, right?  Uh-huh.  She can come out getting laid.  It's a joke.  Fat girl goes into a bar.  Wait.  If she wants to get laid, she's going to get laid.  Who, the skinny girl?  No, the fat girl.  She's going to get laid after all the skinny chicks are taken.  That fat girl is getting laid by a drunk son of a bitch.  I could challenge any skinny chick out there that we could go into a bar, the two of us, 
[02:10:30]  and I would walk out with a man or with a phone number.  Yeah, because you try hard.  You'll be on your knees in front of the bar going, hey, come home with me.  You know what I mean?  It's like a girl will do that and get picked up by a guy that just wants to get laid.  He doesn't want to put the work into the skinny chick,  but I'm sure most of them would rather have the skinny chick.  But the art of it is, you know.  There's no art.  There's an art to the tease.  There's an art to tormenting a man and making him want your body. 
[02:11:00]  Is it Victorian times?  I love teasing a man's body.  I mean, just not.  You better not tease too much.  It's a run.  Just ask OPAC on the message board about teasing a man's body.  Teasing.  That's a tease.  Here's some Mindy art for you.  I love you, baby.  Well, Mindy, you come down with the panties when your little friend leaves town, okay? 
[02:11:30]  And we're not talking about the wrestler.  He's going to lose against those boobs.  Pins.  Three count.  The other sleeper hold.  You know, I love going on your guys' show.  I mean, it's a lot of fun.  We love you, Mindy.  Even though you guys tool on me, I mean...  Mindy, I'll...  You know, I love going on.  You know, it's entertainment, you know?  But I understand there are guys that are into big women like yourself. 
[02:12:00]  Mm-hmm.  You know, I understand there are guys that are definitely into that.  It has nothing to do...  That's what magazines are.  And it has nothing to do with just going for an easy lay.  I...  Oh, yeah.  There are some of them.  Sure.  I just don't get it.  But you're not going to see many of them if you're just out and a chance running.  You go to a convention?  Sure.  They're all there.  But if you go into a bar, I don't think the odds are as good that you're going to find guys that are into fat chicks as they are guys that are into skinny chicks.  That's very true. 
[02:12:30]  But let's put it this way.  I went to Rick's in Clifton, New Jersey the other night.  And...  Clifton.  I was one of the very few big girls there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was dancing...  Dancing my ass off.  Didn't work.  No, it didn't.  It's still there.  It's still there.  I was dancing the entire night and I was having a blast.  Yeah.  I had more men looking at me than at the girl that was dancing with me who was a skinny chick.  Yeah, because they're like...  You know what?  I get out there and I have fun.  Because they're like, who's making the floor shit? 
[02:13:00]  But I get out there and I have fun and I enjoy myself.  And you know what?  I'm not going to let people, you know, be negative towards me or I'm not going to take it internally.  Because you know what?  What's it going to do to my personality?  I mean, I just...  Right.  I like having fun.  And you know, I mean...  Yeah, God bless you for that.  I mean, really.  But yeah, every so often we like injecting a little taste of reality.  All right, Mandy. 
[02:13:30]  Talking about taste of reality and besides big girls do, you know, something else better, too.  Give the best oral, of course.  That's very true.  All right, Mandy.  That's extremely, extremely true.  Oh, I'm in a beating.  All right.  Mandy?  And I challenged that girl from the other day to a contest, you know, a piano following contest.  All right, Mandy, you come down here with your sweaty panties and we'll do the deed there, okay?  Okay, you're going to personally sniff them, Opie?  Oh. 
[02:14:00]  Opie, baby.  Oh, Opie, baby.  I just want to see what these guys are getting for their 30 bucks.  How's that?  Can we see your stuff?  Well, okay.  And, you know, when they want to send in their $30 money orders, they can send me a video box 248,  Levittown, New York, 11756.  That's great.  And let's put it this way.  I don't know if you guys cut out of my P.O. box there or not.  No, we got it on.  You got it on? 
[02:14:30]  Okay.  Why don't we, why don't I make a challenge so you guys...  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  That guy had something to say, but his phone sucks.  All right, go ahead, Mendy.  What?  I'll bring in...  I'll...  You guys, I just...  You're cursing.  I said, hold on, because I've got to get rid of a guy.  So back up 10 seconds and tell me what you're going to say, and we've got to move on.  When did you cut out?  When did you guys cut out?  That was 10 seconds ago.  Trust me, ask anyone that listened to the show today, and...  Mendy, I'm going to let you go, okay?  Okay, love you guys.  All right.  I'll talk to you soon, okay?  Come down with the pen.  How long ago did you guys cut out? 
[02:15:00]  Thank you, Mendy.  Bye, guys.  212-757-1027.  It's the O&A show.  We had a pissed-off BBW on the line.  I guess we hung up.  Ah, of course she did.  No, she was...  She wanted to tell Mendy that she's delusional. 
[02:15:30]  Oh.  Yeah, she was big, too, and she was...  She wanted to say, um, Mendy's delusional, thinking that the guys are after us, and how  she could be in a bar with a girl that's more, I guess, generally accepted as being hot, and  she'll get the guy first.  Yeah, right, after a six-pack.  Hey, Bobby, what's up?  What's going on, O&A?  Hey, man.  It's Bobby Bigrigger. 
[02:16:00]  I was just wondering if you guys could give me a little request.  Uh, Joe's right here today.  I was wondering if I could get that, uh, plane crash sound effect to just top it all off for  me.  It's not that bad.  Someone said we were paying tenants for having such a good week last week.  There you go.  Hey, also...  I've got to pay for it.  Quick question.  Yeah, Bobby.  You guys check out the, um, the WOW stickers we're sending in?  What do you mean?  Uh...  On the website.  More cryptic phone calls that we don't understand. 
[02:16:30]  No, no, no.  On the website.  You got the...  Where you can send in your own WOW sticker, your own WOW sign that you make up?  Oh, yeah.  The WOW design?  Sure.  Yeah, I sent a couple of them there.  I was wondering if you guys checked them out.  Yeah, there's some really good ones on there.  Yeah, there's one on there for the women.  I've got to check that out.  All right, Bobby.  Thank you for that.  All right.  You guys have a good one.  All right, man.  Later.  Oh, wow.  It's a bizarre day.  Phone calls and everything else.  I think it's Balloon Guy.  Thank you.  Don't blame me.  Danny.  Don't blame me.  Danny, you messed us up today.  You've got to blame somebody. 
[02:17:00]  It can't be us.  You made all these lovely balloons and we were mesmerized, I think.  I don't know.  Maybe you're hypnotized.  Ah, Mike, what's going on?  I was looking at those Mindy pictures.  Oh, whatever.  But I was just, thank God that she didn't have her legs open.  And I just kept in this visual of a bulldog eating mayonnaise.  Oh, man.  It made me sick to my stomach.  It had a good one.  Well, Mindy, she's hot and guys want that.  So, yeah.  Who are we to say?  I'm me. 
[02:17:30]  All right, man.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  There are chubby chases.  Let's go to Louis.  Louis.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm sure Mindy could come out with a phone number going into a bar.  Yeah, phone number to the A-S-T-C-A.  Okay.  That one sucked.  They all sucked.  Ben, hallelujah.  Bill, what's going on? 
[02:18:00]  Hey, Bill.  Yeah, I just, uh, hello.  Yeah, what's up, Bill?  Yeah, I just had an idea for the last 50 minutes of this show.  Choices.  Either let's go best of or maybe 50 minutes of inhaler.  Watch out, Maverick.  Watch out.  By the way, does anyone know what kind of cancer Eddie has?  I'm kind of, I know, I, they're not telling you what the cancer is.  Oh, they're not?  He's going to be cancer-free in the very near future.  He's been, uh, he's been fighting cancer, but they don't tell you which one.  Right, Ben?  It's ass cancer, Tony.  Ass cancer. 
[02:18:30]  I, I got to recommend Dr. Kennedy.  Patty Van Halen.  All right, this guy, uh, Chamberlain says, uh, let me on the air.  No way I can make the show worse.  All right.  Chamberlain.  All right, how you doing, Bill?  All right, Chamberlain.  I don't, I don't really have anything to say.  It's just the show looked so bad today, I figured maybe you'd let me on today, you know?  Well, there you are, right?  All right, you're on.  Help, help us out.  Go ahead.  Um, I really have anything to say.  I was honest about it.  I'm a freaking dope.  There's always tomorrow.  There's always tomorrow. 
[02:19:00]  Right.  That's the one thing we can always just embrace.  Thank you.  Take care.  All right.  Uh, our contestant, Jennifer, from today, the only girl that came down for the whipped cream  bikini contest.  Ladies, you still can come down this week.  Yeah.  And, uh, be in on the contest, Grand Prize Hawaii.  Jennifer.  Hi, guys.  Hi, what's up?  Um, I was worried.  The way you're talking about how bad today was, I'm like, are they talking about the  pictures, too?  No, I thought you looked really good.  Did I?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay, I haven't gotten to see them yet, so.  No, your pictures are up. 
[02:19:30]  Uh, we're hoping they put a picture of you with the fake teeth.  That was pretty funny.  I know.  I want that up there, too.  I thought that might, you know, help give me an extra kick or something.  No, you were the brightest part of today.  Oh, they are.  They are, yeah.  There's a picture with her teeth.  Oh, fabulous.  Oh, my God.  All right, then they changed the pictures up.  Okay.  There's you with your, uh, sunglasses on.  You have a really, really nice body.  Oh, cool.  Thank you.  And you chose...  Maybe, maybe a finalist?  Uh, well, you might have, uh, used a little too much, uh, whipped cream.  Oh, well.  That could be... 
[02:20:00]  Well, that's a lie.  That was your choice, though.  I, uh, we'll see.  Okay.  We should put the picture of you with the, the fake teeth as a finalist.  That could be fun.  Okay.  Cool.  All right.  Thanks for coming down and helping us out today.  Oh, no problem.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Let's, uh, go to Sam.  Sam, what's up?  Hey, ONA.  How's it going?  All right.  I feel like you guys are having just as bad a day as I am.  What happened to you today?  Uh, you know, just crap at work.  The usual stuff.  Anyway, I wanted to tell you about Eddie Van Halen.  I think he's got, uh, tongue cancer. 
[02:20:30]  I read that online.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Either from singing at, uh, Yankee games or from sticking your tongue up Uncle Junior's, uh,  balloon knot.  What else, Bob?  Yeah.  Thank you.  A lot of people speculate that it's like either tongue or mouth cancer.  Mm.  Well, not the singer.  He could still play.  Why could it happen to David Lee Ross?  Holy. 
[02:21:00]  What's that?  Oh.  Hey, Neil, what's up?  Yeah.  I think, uh, that, uh, tongue cancer is due to, uh, uh, exploring, uh, Valley Bertinelli's,  uh, most intimate of regions.  It's not helping out, Opie.  It's not helping out.  I thought you guys would help us today.  I guess not.  Usually, if we're having a bad day, the phones pull us right out.  We're all in the crapper today.  Oh, you don't think that's possible?  Mm.  All right.  Thank you.  Hey, Kimmy. 
[02:21:30]  Hey, oh, what are you doing?  Are we allowed to talk to you on the air?  Yes, you can talk to me on the air.  Kimmy from Survivor.  Yeah, I just wanted to, uh, to, uh, clarify some of the rumors.  Oh, my God.  There's, like, rumors.  People are coming up to my, uh, my grandmother.  My grandmother's 85, bless her heart.  And somebody went.  You want to come in for the, uh, whipped cream bikini thing?  Right.  Well, we haven't talked to you since you got completely naked for us and did the whipped cream  bikini contest.  And your pictures made it on, uh, extra.  Did you see that?  No, I missed it.  Uh, no one called you on it? 
[02:22:00]  No, um, you know.  They had the pictures of you in the whipped cream bikini contest, uh, all over extra the  other night.  That's great.  But, you know, did they tell, did they tell the whole world that it was on 1027?  Uh.  Oh, being Anthony?  No.  Uh, not really.  Oh, I'm sorry.  They said some radio thing on any W.  But you're going to, you're going to get naked when Survivor's live next week, right?  I'm going to try.  Yeah.  Actually, Mark Burnett, Mark Burnett called me up today.  Uh-huh.  And I was out shopping.  And I'm like, am I in trouble?  And he goes, no, no, no. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, Kimberly, you're fine.  Oh, did he see the pictures?  Yeah, I guess so.  But, no, but listen to this.  I'm cranking off a batch as we speak.  Wonderful.  Someone calls up my grandmother and hangs up on her at the day that it was on the radio.  And they're like, Kimmy's on the radio.  And then click, hung up.  And then the next day, someone must have, like, printed the pictures of me in the whipped cream bikini  and, like, knocks on her door and ran from my little 85-year-old grandmother's outside. 
[02:23:00]  And she sees pictures of her grandchild practically naked.  What a prick.  Who did that?  That's horrible.  Oh, no.  But I was just laughing.  I'm like, where am I?  It was whipped cream.  She's like, but I don't think I like that.  I'll tell it a light now.  All right.  It was very funny, though.  I'm like, Grandma.  And meanwhile, she's the one that a couple weeks ago told me, you know, with your boobs,  you can't get a job somewhere.  Yeah.  So, for the... 
[02:23:30]  In Bull Creek, down in Smithtown.  So, that's what you want to clear up?  No, I want to say hello.  And I just thought it was funny that these are the rumors that are being spread out all over.  Oh, and people are scolding Jeff.  Jeff is talking about, you know, giving things to children's auctions and children's charities.  And they're like, is this what you do?  This is the behavior of someone who wants to go and do good things for children?  Oh, if you do good things for children, you don't have any want or need to see nude women anymore?  Right.  Right.  Oh, please.  So, you guys have the balloon man in there? 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, Yanny.  Here's a fellow reality show person.  He's kind of quiet.  He's very quiet.  It's okay.  You should see the balloon things he made.  The highlight of the day.  Can he make a kangaroo?  Huh?  I can make a kangaroo.  You want a kangaroo?  You can make a kangaroo?  Because koosha is the aboriginal term for kangaroo.  I thought it meant a-poo-ha.  Do you have people like the pictures or what? 
[02:24:30]  People love the pictures of you, Kimmy.  They're freaking out.  Now, here's something I've got to ask you.  Are you willing to promote the O&A show on a national level next Thursday?  I will definitely try.  I will definitely, you know, as soon as a whipped cream bikini comes up, you know I'm going to say, what am I going to say?  I'm going to be like, oh, I'll be an Anthony on the radio.  All right.  This is the challenge I put out to you.  The best plug ever for the O&A show was given by Jay Moore when he was filling in for Regis on the Regis and Kelly show. 
[02:25:00]  Okay.  But if you plug us next Thursday when they're live, no one will ever beat that.  Yeah.  This is going to be like 50 or 60 million people watching.  That's a lot of pressure, guys.  But I will definitely, you know, I will definitely try.  Kimmy, you want the whole nation to talk about you the next day?  You've got to drop your top.  Oh.  Pull a Drew Barrymore, huh?  Whoa.  That would be giant.  You've got to find something you could wear where it's just easy access, and you've got to pick your spot, and you just do it. 
[02:25:30]  You know why I may not do that?  It's because my father will be sitting in the audience.  He'd love it.  He would love it.  My father, oh, I don't know.  I'll try.  Look, you know what?  I was good, though.  That's a blow-off if I've ever heard of one.  After I did the bikini.  Right.  After I did the whipped cream bikini, I actually called up my parents.  I'm like, listen, I'm just letting you know.  You know, I wore a little bikini.  It was made out of whipped cream.  Fine.  And the next day, my father would walk into town, and someone's like, hey, you know what Kimberly wears now?  My father's like, yeah, dairy products. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, but it was harmless, Kimmy.  I had fun.  It was harmless.  Girls got much more naked than you, matter of fact.  Yes, they did.  Yeah.  And some of them looked really good.  I went and checked out the website.  Oh, and get this.  I went to Wichita the other day after I saw you guys.  Yeah.  And I had those pictures all over Wichita.  Oh, cool.  So I turned people on to O&A, and they were actually downloading.  I think someone on either Foundry or when we did a little Yahoo search, they had segments of different shows and stuff.  So I had people in Wichita listening to O&A. 
[02:26:30]  Oh, right on.  Our biggest promoter.  Well, you got the exposure all over Extra, so that was fun.  Why, thank you.  Hey, I hear you got a new boy toy.  I do not.  Rumors.  Oh, my God.  Rumors.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  You go away for a couple of days, and people automatically think there's boys around.  Well, you know, we're hearing things.  Yeah.  Okay, I bought a new toy.  That's what I said.  I bought a new toy.  Not a new boy toy.  I bought a toy.  Oh, what toy?  Um, it's a new one, and it's a little bit bigger than the old one. 
[02:27:00]  Oh.  So I like it.  And it's got faster speed, that's all.  For those lonelier nights.  Right.  Did you hang out with Jeff after the whipped cream bikini thing?  No, Jeff, like, ran.  Jeff, like, ran away.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Have you spoken to Jim Norton at any time off the show?  No, and I even gave him my phone number.  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Norton's gay.  I'm just, look, I'm going to go out now and just say, Jim Norton is gay. 
[02:27:30]  Why does he, after seeing all of your intimate parts, he cleans up your butt, you give him your number, he doesn't call you?  Yeah.  All right, Norton's gay.  I'm saying it.  I'm saying it right now.  So you wanted Norton to call you, Kimmy, right?  Yes, I wanted to go see your show and hang out and visit and have fun and play.  Instead, I want my full rent.  Do you think there'd be a chance, if you went out with Jim Norton, that there would be some kind of sexual activity? 
[02:28:00]  It depends on how much he would let me rub his head.  Wow.  Hey, Yaney's hair is starting to grow in.  You want to go out with Yaney from boot camp?  I think I'm okay.  You guys can have some type of reality children.  He can make you a big gildo out of balloons.  He can make you a new toy.  Kimmy, we got a new thing for you.  How about if he puts in a balloon, you know where, and then blows it up? 
[02:28:30]  That would be a pretty wild feeling.  Come on, that's old hat.  You don't think it's been done before?  Have you done that before, Yaney?  Only with a pump.  You feed it, you like would feed it.  Have you pumped it up when it's, yeah, everyone knows what we're talking about, really?  It happened, yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  And what happens?  Is a girl...  Her eyes shot out of her head.  Her eyes shot out of her head.  That's something I'd like to say.  Yeah.  All right, Kimmy, I guess we'll let you go. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah, I'm going to go buy groceries now, so I just want to say hello, and I'm going off  to L.A. on Wednesday, so I will give it my best.  You know that I will definitely give it my best, and it's got to come up.  You know what seems to be coming up on the night show or in the morning.  All right.  Brian Gumbel likes to disturb, so...  We'll all be watching, Kimmy.  All right, guys.  Have a great day.  Thank you.  Okay, bye.  All right, there's Kimmy from Survivor.  What's with me?  Friend of the show.  That's like the second chick.  That was a sure thing.  Come on. 
[02:29:30]  Maybe he's, you know, he's keeping, you know, under the radar.  Drudge Jr.  Hey.  Oh, hey, Drudge Jr.  Hey, by the way, what a great call on me signing with Comedy World Internet Radio.  Well...  Did you hear about that?  That guy, you know...  Did you hear about Comedy World Internet Radio?  Yeah, it's gone.  Right.  What happened to it?  It folded.  No listeners.  No listeners.  And it is bankrupt history gone.  Thank you.  You swore it was true, Drudge Jr. 
[02:30:00]  What?  You swore that it was true.  That we're going...  Your sources said it was true.  That guy didn't deny it, you know.  I wanted to...  All right.  Now, I hear you got a scoop on Eddie Van Halen and the cancer he has.  Yeah, it's a cornucopia, which is, um...  It's a type of cancer.  Usually, you get it when you chew a lot of tobacco.  Yeah.  So, his cancer is in his mouth.  Yeah.  Well, we kind of all know that.  No, it's cornucopia.  That's what kind of cancer it is.  It's like on the gums.  On the gums. 
[02:30:30]  Cornucopia.  Isn't cornucopia used when you want to sound intelligent?  Isn't cornucopia the big thing on Thanksgiving?  Yeah, Thanksgiving.  That's what I thought, too.  But it says in the start of all year.  All right.  Now, that's it, Drudge Jr.?  Anything else that you're working on?  I guess you could talk about the Teen Bush thing.  Jenna Bush, George L.B. Bush's daughter, is in some sort of video.  Right.  Oh, yeah? 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  I just know what kind of video it is.  Porno?  Yep.  You're reporting that George W.'s daughter.  1027 WNEW is.  The Sports Guys at 5 a.m.  The Radio Chick at 9.  Ron and Fez at noon.  Opie and Anthony at 3.  Don and Mike at 7.  Next time, on a very special, Ron and Fez.  Fez sees that life is all about choices.  Ronnie, I've decided to keep this baby.  But, Fez, you can't.  Give me one reason why not. 
[02:31:30]  Because here comes his parents.  Why don't these daycare centers have more access?  All on the next, Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez.  Middays, noon to 3.  1027 WNEW.  Anthony, Planet Java.  Oh, yeah.  This is the iced coffee that we're all drinking in the back office.  The coolest thing to hit the streets.  This spring is iced coffee.  It's called Planet Java.  Great tasting.  Planet Java is out to kick the competition's ass.  So, keep an eye out for the Planet Java sampling trucks.  The Street Patrol is coming to an area near you with cool new flavors like Javadelic, Trimble, and Karamoca. 
[02:32:00]  You know about Javadelic, the grown-up milkshake, right?  Low-fat mixture of milk and coffee, in a word.  Smooth.  And Karamoca, chocolate, caramel, and a coffee.  It's a dessert.  It's a morning drink.  It's a cure for the AIDS.  It's everything.  It's a great mixer.  See, I threw that in there to see if you were paying attention.  If you're feeling creative, it's perfect.  Karamoca.  And Trimble, if you need an extra kick in your day, 121 milligrams of caffeine can do it. 
[02:32:30]  Trimble, the highest caffeinated drink in the country.  Is it legal?  Who knows?  You get the idea.  Trimble does the trick deliciously.  And the wildest thing in town, Planet Java.  Iced coffee with an attitude.  And available wherever Coca-Cola products are sold.  If your retailer doesn't have Planet Java, punch him in the face.  And say, get Planet Java.  Iced coffee just got cool.  Settle for nothing less.  Planet Java.  Stupid.  The award-winning. 
[02:33:00]  Coping and Anthony Schoves.  This has got to be a joke, people.  I can't be a busy.  All right, we're going to give away a chance to win a trip to L.A. in just a minute here.  But Steve, a dentist, has something to say about Drugs Jr.  Hey, hello, guys.  Yeah, what's up, Steve?  Yeah, I've been a dentist for a while.  I've never heard of a cornucopia kind of cancer in the mouth.  Yeah, I know.  It's carcinoma.  What is it called?  Carcinoma.  Carcinoma, as in cars.  I know.  What is carcinoma?  Carcinoma is just a generic word that means mouth cancer. 
[02:33:30]  You get it real easy if you're chewing tobacco.  What's the definition of cornucopia?  Only cornucopia I see is that thing that you get around Thanksgiving.  It's the horn of plenty.  Horn of plenty.  All the fruit and stuff coming out of it.  Very nice.  So I don't think Eddie's got fruit coming out of his mouth.  No, it's carcinoma.  Carcinoma.  And people out there that are chewing tobacco, stop.  Get cancer right away.  Do you ever see pictures of people with their jaws cut off?  Nice.  Oh, that rocks.  You've got a nose and you've got a throat.  Nice.  And that's it. 
[02:34:00]  Do you have a radio message board anywhere?  You ought to do that.  No, I don't.  Just the listener.  That's all.  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  It's a big hit with the dentist, I heard.  All right, now's your chance to win a trip or two to L.A. to attend the live broadcast  of the Survivor Town Hall meeting happening this Thursday.  Yes.  Right after the final episode of Survivor, the Australian Outback, you'll be in the studio  audience.  You'll enjoy L.A. for a little bit.  Be there live as Kimmy rips her clothes off.  Yeah, she's going to try to do something for our show.  We'll see what happens.  It would be nice. 
[02:34:30]  In front of like 60 million people.  You want to be there, you're going to have to like fly out Thursday morning, I believe.  Yeah, real quick, like you win and then you're gone the next day, so don't F with us.  But to qualify, you had to be watching CBS this morning in the 6 a.m. hour, Anthony and  I were on TV.  Yeah.  We had a quick, wacky little video clip.  And now we have to ask the people a question about the clip that we saw.  Right.  That everyone else saw as well.  Mm-hmm.  I thought you had the question. 
[02:35:00]  Um, well, we were doing some kind of Australian, um, um, um, um, what were we doing?  We were like taking, uh, we had a book with various Australian words.  Right.  And their English translation.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, we can do that.  All right.  What is the English translation of Mozzie's?  There you go.  Mozzie's.  That was the wacky, uh, little segment.  If you get the answer right, you'll qualify for the trip to L.A. 
[02:35:30]  You'll get a nice, uh, Survivor, I don't know, what are they calling it?  Survivor prize pack.  Survivor.  That's for playing and you'll fly to L.A. like Thursday morning.  So you've got to be able to get off work.  That's cool.  And leave, uh, Thursday.  So you'll miss Thursday and Friday.  Balloon guy's joking on us.  Wow.  Even Balloon guy thinks we're boring.  He just walked out of the show.  That's pretty pathetic.  Uh, Brian, what's going on?  I got the answer to your question.  What is, uh, the English translation of Mozzie's? 
[02:36:00]  Mosquito.  There you go.  There it is.  There it is.  It was that easy.  You qualified, uh, to go to L.A.  Can you go to L.A.?  Yeah.  Spare of the moment.  If, if you win, uh, when we pick the winner Wednesday, uh, Wednesday night, you can go Thursday morning?  Sure.  All right, cool.  Hold on the line, all right?  Yep.  Congratulations, Brian.  That's a winner.  Ah, yes.  Make sure you, uh, you tune in, uh, CBS this morning.  So, uh, tomorrow morning in the 6 a.m. hour, we'll have another, like, video clip for you to check out. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  And we'll ask you a question at 6.30, uh, tomorrow night.  Mm-hmm.  Simple as that.  Let's go to Chuck.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Chuck, what's going on?  Hey, it's Chuck from Chuck Radio.  How you guys doing?  Hey, Chuck.  Listen, I learned a new term for anal today.  Uh, yes.  Plowed in the dumper.  Plowed in the dumper.  Yes.  Mm-hmm.  Thanks, guys.  That's a new term.  Hey, Chuck, thanks for helping us out with that.  No problem, man.  All right.  Later.  Bye.  But do you know the, um, the, uh, Chinese, do you know the whole thing that happened with the plane?  Now, their, their whole new tack on warfare against us is website hacking. 
[02:37:00]  Website hacking?  The Chinese are now hacking everyone's website.  And, uh, UPI, the, um, United Press International site, just got hacked.  Um, and look at what they're doing.  There's a, uh, uh, an image of a fluttering Chinese flag with, uh, English writing.  One says, the great Chinese nation, hooray.  I love how they translate things.  Or, uh, don't translate it.  Uh, USA will be with responsibility for accident totally. 
[02:37:30]  Protest USA sell weapons to Taiwan.  Now, that almost sounds like, protest USA, sell weapons to Taiwan.  But they don't want us to.  Break the world peace.  And USA is bitch.  USA is bitch.  I don't know.  I'm looking forward to it.  Come on.  Hack foundry, you chinks.  I want to see this.  No one can navigate Steve C. site. 
[02:38:00]  He's got a new site on it.  I know.  I worked his balls off on that.  And, and people are, uh, complimenting it.  So now it's, and you know something?  I got a lot of crap for criticizing foundry's old site, which was very, I got, it was easier  to navigate the, uh, the old passage around the, the cape of good fear or whatever the  hell it is.  You know what I'm talking about?  I'm having a difficult day.  Cape of hope.  Cape of good hope.  Steve, though, you, you, you have a new site up on foundry. 
[02:38:30]  Oh.  Yeah.  Uh, actually.  I got, I really have to thank Jeff, who did not sleep all weekend, got this thing completely  overhauled.  We modeled it after sites that get 10 times the traffic that we do and are, and are visited  by children, six to eight years old.  Well, that's what we needed.  Exactly.  And I have been getting nice email all day.  See?  From people.  Now, I, I would like an apology from Jeff.  Oh.  No, you're not going to get it.  Because every time I would bash the site, because I, I get on it, navigating it, I couldn't 
[02:39:00]  not find a thing.  You know something?  He's really good at developing websites for corporations.  And I, one of the things that I told him when we were doing this is he grossly overestimated  the intelligence or the web savvy ability of the people who are going to be doing this.  Did you, did you hear the calls tonight?  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you.  That completely justified that statement.  Thank you.  Model is up to the romper room.  Jesus Christ.  Let's get out of here with a quick game of what did we learn on the ONA show today?  Eric, what's going on? 
[02:39:30]  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  All right.  There's two things that I learned.  There's, there's a new cancer called Kornikova.  Kornikova.  That's an even better one.  Kornikova.  And the other thing that I learned is as a young lad, Anthony used two pieces of liver  for self-satisfaction.  Yeah.  Later, guys.  All right, all right.  Thank you.  Dan from Hoboken.  I learned Eddie Van Halen has horn of great fear cancer.  Paul from Rockville Center.  Today I learned that Mason and Kalinsky were a pretty funny asshole. 
[02:40:00]  Shut up.  Dan from Hoboken.  I learned if I shave my head and tell pedophile jokes, I can score with a celebrity.  Al Mack from Clifton.  And today I learned that if you put a prick in a balloon knot, it leaks more.  I want to thank Yaney for coming by and making all his fun balloon things.  Great.  What's next?  What's next for the Yaney?  Yeah.  What are you doing?  Actually, his name's Sean.  Sean.  Call me Yaney.  Yaney.  All right.  What's next for Yaney?  I have no idea.  Wait a minute.  I think I got a bar mitzvah coming up. 
[02:40:30]  Hey, look at you.  A bar mitzvah.  Are you very big at the bar mitzvahs?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I bet.  Soccer Patty.  Hi, how are you?  Good.  Oh, I learned that I'm not a finalist in the contest.  Oh, wait a minute.  Well, we haven't picked our finalist yet.  I was just using you as an example.  Oh, I know.  So once we weed through it, who knows?  You might be a finalist.  Yeah, it'll be something to remember someday when I look back on things and laugh.  Patty, I'll leave you with this.  Your body not as bad as Mendy's. 
[02:41:00]  Well, thank you for the compliment.  I appreciate it.  Compliment.  Well, let me go back to my dinner now.  Have a good day.  All right, Patty.  What's up?  At least you can eat.  Andy, what's going on?  Hey, I learned that the real godfather is a white Italian guy who digs fat chicks.  I learned that blue animals don't necessarily mean good radio.  All right, Andy.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks a lot, Mike.  Bye.  Let's move on to Steve.  Steve, what's up?  Yeah, great show today, guys.  Thanks a lot.  Yeah.  I'm only kidding.  Hey, there's one consolation.  You'll never have to hear it again on Best Sucks. 
[02:41:30]  Thank God.  Real quick, what did I learn?  I learned that balloon guy is radio kryptonite.  Oh, God.  Oh, I'm kidding, Sean.  What did he do?  It wasn't his fault.  He just started it.  Let me help out.  It had nothing to do with Sean.  I know, I know.  Just busting chops.  And also, not all women from Pennsylvania are pigs.  There you go.  Peace, guys.  Thank you.  Later.  Let's go to Rim.  Rim, what's going on?  What's up, Opus?  Hey.  What's up, Anthony?  Hey.  The guy who head-busts the Ram, that was real.  And Mandy doesn't have implants.  She has eggplants, Anthony. 
[02:42:00]  That was funny, as hell.  Thank you.  Wow.  Someone got a laugh out of today's joke.  Damn.  He loves it.  I got a split up a kind of brain, you know?  All right.  Thank you.  Later, boys.  Bye.  Chris, what's going on?  Yeah.  Today, I learned black comedians make Chuck Knife sound like Eddie Murphy.  And Brian Regan stops in for Paisano's live reads.  That's nice of it.  You've got to say, but I love him.  Oh, of course you love him.  There you go.  You've got to love him.  Thank you.  All right.  I'm sorry I wasn't so funny, guys.  No, you're good.  You were fine.  You were funny.  We laughed. 
[02:42:30]  Phil, what's up?  Yeah, I just learned how far you guys will actually go to try to resurrect a bad show.  Mandy's panties?  Well, you've got to take one for the team.  I'll see what it's about.  Mandy's panties?  Come on, Oates.  I'll see what it's about.  Wow.  That's really bad.  Guys are paying $30 for this pleasure.  Well.  I want to understand why.  I have no idea how they could do that.  All right, man.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Bye.  Today I learned Jamaican Mike is visiting the Bizarro O&A show today. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  Dennis.  Yo, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  I learned that raping your escorpion is okay.  Thank you, Dennis.  Thank you, Anthony.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Mike, what's going on?  Yo, guys.  Hey.  I learned that Kimmy's got a bigger, better vibrator.  Yeah, we did learn that today.  That was good news.  All right.  Thank you. 
[02:43:30]  Go ahead.  All right.  I learned next week is building house from Icicle Pop Day.  Yeah.  We might as well do that after our MIME interview.  Sandy.  Yeah.  What's up?  Hey.  I learned that April showers bring corners.  Yeah, we did learn that, anyway.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks.  Bye.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike, what's going on?  What's up?  I learned two things.  Yeah.  One, Anthony's jaw hurts when he blows.  Mm-hmm.  Brian Regan really kills.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:44:00]  And I wonder if you have any details on the softball game.  Not yet.  Not yet?  Working out the details.  All right.  And I hope that Lewis dies of age.  He's still freaking annoying.  All right.  Bye.  All right.  Bye.  People not big fans of Lewis.  John, what's going on?  Hey, I learned there's nothing like FU Mondays.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks for a great show.  Give them balloons a bad name, man.  Take it easy.  All right.  You know how quickly they forget the previous week, Opie.  You're only as good as your last show. 
[02:44:30]  Let's go.  Hey, Rick, did you get pictures of the balloon stuff?  You've got to have something to remember today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Tomorrow, Rodney Dangerfield and Louis Black coming in.  And hopefully more ladies for the whipped cream bikini contest.  You can still qualify for the contest.  A little confusion out there.  Ladies, yes.  You can still come down here, get into a whipped cream bikini, and you'll have a chance to go to Hawaii.  Thank you, Contiki Tours.  All right?  Hopefully more ladies will show up tomorrow. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, please, ladies.  Come on.  All right.  Jesus.  That would have helped us today.  Hell, yeah.  Well, Sean, I want to thank you for coming in.  Thank you very much.  I just plugged Boot Camp in the...  Oh, yeah.  Plug whatever you want.  Boot Camp Wednesday night at 9 o'clock on Fox.  Yes.  And if you want balloons, you can get me at 1-866-MAD-HATTER.  Oh, you're Manhattan.  The Manhattan Balloon Sculptors.  You make good money doing this, man.  I got to ask.  Okay. 
[02:45:30]  I'm just asking.  No, it's good.  Okay.  You know what I can't wait for?  Well, way down the line, long time from now, your name is still going to come up in various ways on instant feedback and phone calls when we're really sucking.  You know?  But it had nothing to do with you.  It really did.  But now you're kind of tied into one of those shows.  Rarely happens.  But the people that are here, when that happens, they take the brunt of it, my friend.  I'll have to make it up to you again.  Well, it's not your fault. 
[02:46:00]  You did a great look at it.  I mean, where else are we going to get a motorcycle guy made out of balloons?  Yeah, it's pretty cute.  Was this a trick balloon, by the way?  No, no, that's okay.  I'll keep trying.  Allie, what's going on?  Yes, I want to play with my lunch today.  Yes.  If I go to Poconos with my girlfriend, all I can do is horse riding and effing all weekend.  Horseback riding and effing.  That's right. 
[02:46:30]  Poconos is only good for effing and horseback riding.  Thank you.  Okay.  Need a translator there.  Thank you.  And with that, let's get the F out of here.
